And then the doctors took him away from his beloued wife and son.

4.5/10

"Ah fuck 'em, let 'em cook"
He's burying the toys.

yeah, but he's extremely bad at it
But then the barbarians fucked shit up.
notbladerunner/10
Shark hunter/10
not to mention his jokes are terribly unfunny
8/10. Pacing is a little wonky and the characters are a bit flat, but still a pretty solid movie. I can safely say that I was entertained.
/me hangs up sign "Caution: Falling Empire"
Mars Attacks, AKA the movie of Gak
the "angry reviewer" thing got old by the time I turned 12

nostaliga critic is pretty good
I promise not to say murica..
I WAS ENTERTAINED/10

00,10aired, no
00,10leaked yes
it was a leaked ep
05leaked =/= aired
I've watched it 3 times! :D
it doesntt count
It was actually only "okay".
No references
05btw
Though there was some fanservice again.
05talking about it is a bannableo ffence
05the episode that is
05so shh
i hate spoils and leaked eps
Anyone know when the fan-made projects are slated to be released?
00,10wish apple would quit leaking them
:D
Hub World leaked it, NOT apple
Anyway...
agreed
00,10geting sick of people coming in every hour with zomg I watched the ep
05:P
00,10ah
WHOA
:O
yay:[
this is pretty cool
05like it matters
05a leak is a leak
No more talk about this anyway
sick matchup of my two favorite things: Luna and Diana

oh u eppuljack
Aaaaah.
00,10well they do have a trackrecord of leaking them
00,10this is the 7th leaked ep
00,106 of them were apple
THE 7TH?!
i think applejack is adrble
somebody made a remix of this
FUUUUU ...
Yeah, the 7th?
Was that the first?
00,10s2 eps were leaked often as well
I imagine jobs are lost over it.
Okay now I see why people are blaming apple

"Wake Up Applejack" next please?
this song's from hocus pocus
wow 345 viewers. Is that typical at this time?
00,10SpirittHooves, get adblock+
Voice crack for a moment?
Not if you use Safari, Adblock does not catch USTREAM in Safari
00,10Punkie_Pue you have wrong numbers
00,10it's only 145
highly doubt that was a voice crack
did the full animation for this come out yet?
Oh oops. Youre right.
huh, 213 viewers for me
What's the 3018 mean?
oh, nvm
That plectrum...
00,10the crew working on this is currently working with the Documentry
