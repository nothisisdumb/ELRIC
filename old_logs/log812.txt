<Kammerjunk> It was out before the episode ended.
<Jake> damn
<Jake> now for real back to programming
<Barbetos> Si.
<Kammerjunk> Da.
<Jake> Ja.
<Kammerjunk> Ita.
<CTHULHU> Fu.
<Ninjazz|Busy> When and how do you tell when it's "out of hand"? I mean, jeesus. The artists get content out faster than any other group I've ever seen. But it's still apparently not at /that/ point yet.
<Jake> Oui.
<Kammerjunk> ...I'm all out.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Hai.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|Busy: Hai.
<Kammerjunk> RoboGerbil: God dammit, man. Why did you have to link that.
<Kammerjunk> It's so darned CATCHY.
<RoboGerbil> its addicting like i said...
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy Honestly it probably already is at /that/ point
<CTHULHU> This is better. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c98gIxCe1zo
<Barbetos> Eh. I really hope I am wrong though.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, but does it change anything?
<Kammerjunk> "This video contains content from EMI, who has blah blah blah."
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy Yes. It does, and if you don't think so just look what has happened to other fandoms that got the same treatment
<djblazekin> why is it that movies display runtime in minutes
<Kammerjunk> CTHULHU: To be honest, I prefer Raubtier.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> bia everyone
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, the keyword is fandom. You get any bad apple in the bunch all the whole group gets spoiled. Granted anyone is free to do whatever they want to in their bedrooms as long as they don't freaking talk about it like it's casual conversation.
<Dark92Enigma> hello everypony!
<CTHULHU> Kammerjunk: I can respect that.
<Kammerjunk> CTHULHU: That's not to say they aren't good, of course. Always a fan of metal.
<CTHULHU> right on.
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy It wish what you said was possible with the bad apple as you put it, but this is the day and age of the internet where everything is put there, for everyone to find.
<Dark92Enigma> anypony here that's been in Shizuka's stream last night?.........i'm back
<Barbetos> Now if you had NEVER ever seen this fandom before, and you decide you want to check it out, the first thing you do is google My Little Pony Friendshi is Magic and you see r34, do you THINK you would stick around?
<Barbetos> And the same thing goes for people already in the fandom.
<Barbetos> Those same people who did the google search are going to ask
<Kammerjunk> One bad apple spoils the bunch for everyone else, though. The image the rest of the world has of bronies is because of the select few people who act like downright jerks. The worst part of any group is always the loudest.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, then it's just something we deal with, man. Can't change it. Can't make people shut up about it. Especially when complaining about anything apparently just makes it more controversial. I mean, I'd like to limit the porn to a limit where it's only in places where people HAVE to look for them. Not the case where people can stumble on them. But we just have to deal with it. :/
<Kammerjunk> And with jerks, I mean the people who insist on shoving it down the throats of everyone around them.
<Dark92Enigma> Hello Wrek!
<RoboGerbil> best song youve prolly never heard of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj3mKYASycg
<Dark92Enigma> Hello everypony, i'm back!
<djblazekin> i would and am still with it also with the kim possible fandom
<Kandarihu> wrek2, we only see your splash image.
<CTHULHU> There's a kim possible fandom?
<Barbetos> I felt the same way as you Ninjazz|Busy I did not think it mattered. And then when I tried to argue that it was okay with some one who was against r34 for mlp I found I had no legit arguement as to how it could be good for anything.
<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz|Busy: If you play with Google Images, you're bound to get burned.
<CTHULHU> FINNTROLL!!!
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, in that case, it didn't matter if it was good or not. If someone wanted to make porn, they're going to make porn. Unless you can convince hundreds of like minded artists.
<djblazekin> i was searching for kp wallpapers and i came acrossed the r34 imigase at age 15 i had a psp
<Ninjazz|Busy> Kammerjunk, boy did I learn that the hard way.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, not to make porn and make something else.*
<Kammerjunk> Barbetos: Well, that's the thing. It's good to -them- because -they- like it.
<djblazekin> i was using google images with no filters
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy your missing the point. I realize it is going to happen and I have no control. I am not complaining, some of those artist are pretty good. I am saying it WILL ruin everything good that bronies have worked for. No one would continue with that name if it meant to be tagged with the ideal that you like to look at that sort of thing.
<CTHULHU> use bing then.
<Kammerjunk> R34 ruins the fandom? You've never been on /mlp/, I take it.
<Kammerjunk> People there don't need R34 to destroy the image of the fandom.
<Barbetos> Not saying I don't see it.
<Barbetos> Kammerjunk R34 is probably the worst aspect though, and the most likely to do so.
<djblazekin> nice spitfire @wreck
<Barbetos> I have no controll over it I realize, agian I am not trying to make it stop.
<Barbetos> Its fine, its just bad.
<Barbetos> Get it?
<Kammerjunk> And that's assuming I believe there is a such thing as a collective fandom. To me, the whole brony thing is just a bunch of people who watch the show. I don't like to imagine I have an image to set to the outside world because of my preferences.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Oh no no. Barbetos, I don't think r34 ruins the fandom at all. It's just part of it. It's there but it's like all regular porn. It's always the extremists that ruin any group. You /can/ like the porn and still be a chill person in most respects. Also, I have to disagree on the point that bronies are working towards anything in general. I mean...what are we trying to accomplish? I thought
<Ninjazz|Busy> being a brony was about being a fan.
<CTHULHU> i agree. ^
<Kammerjunk> To summarise my beliefs about most everything, if you don't stick it down the throats of others, I really couldn't care less.
<Kammerjunk> Tolerance of everything but intolerance.
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Jake> alright animations are done
<Jake> now to write the code
<CTHULHU> what band is this?
<Ninjazz|Busy> "Just don't hurt anyone" is mine. Rather broad statement.
<djblazekin> miku pony
<Kammerjunk> CTHULHU: This is Alestorm with Keelhauled.
<CTHULHU> oh, thanks
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy And for a lot of people that is where it stops. But what about... Bronystate? Do you think you would of ever found this place if it weren't for MLP? Furthermore do you think it would be as well run? Now imagine if this site starts to lose viwership becuase of a stigma like I am speaking of? I like this place, and I like the charities, and the conventions. All that could go away
<Barbetos> with a simple misconception made by a few "bad" apples.
<Wrek> 05heh
<Wrek> 05bad apples
<Barbetos> His words.
<Barbetos> I mean why do you think there is a rule here against that sort of thing?
<Jake> wow that was easy
<Barbetos> Its not becuase it is just unwanted, but it would chase people off.
<Barbetos> Its offensive, and it matters.
<RaveBrony> What would chase people off?
<RaveBrony> *butting into the conversation*
<MadSurge> Smut
<Barbetos> r34.
<RaveBrony> o_e
<djblazekin> http://metadragonart.deviantart.com/art/Hatsune-Miku-pony-334283946
<RaveBrony> The reason I came here and stayed was becuz of that rule, haha
<RoboGerbil> new stream chased some people off?
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, well, let me put it this way. I found MLP, the fandom because of the very thing we're discussing. First thing I saw was a porn spray of Pinkie Pie in TF2. I hated it and everyone associated with the fandom for a while but got over than realized that none is anyof my business to judge. Look where I am now. I mean, all this stuff is hard to calculate and just... happens, man.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Good lord look at my grammar.
<Kammerjunk> I'd like to see an actual habour café some day.
<Kammerjunk> harbour*
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: good thing we dislike pony r34 eh? :)
<Wrek> 05so far so good on this image :3
<Ninjazz|Busy> MadSurge, I have no problems with it. But I'd like it to stay where it belongs. ^_^
<djblazekin> i was the same way after seeing starscream getting his ass whooped by rd but after hering this day aria i got attached especially when i saw the first 2 eps of season 1
<MadSurge> Wrek: you just need to put something on those bare walls :D
<Barbetos> Ninjazz|Busy Still, not agrueing that it should or should not happen. It does. I am stating that it can be bad for bronies in general, in all facets of the aspect of calling yourself a brony. Worst case it stops the show from ever being made again by a decent studio. Its great that YOU see past it, and see it for what it is, but people generally have a closed mind to that thing.
<MadSurge> djblazekin: to be honest G1 Starscream was always a complete joke
<Kammerjunk> Man, Alestorm always makes me want to play Sid Meier's Pirates.
<Barbetos> While you may have been made a fan, I bet there where 10 people on that server who would never look at bronies, or mlp in a good light becuase of ONE little pic.
<MadSurge> Or so I'm told
<RaveBrony> I know if I saw 'that' spray first, i wouldve hated bronies.
<Kammerjunk> I guess I was just lucky I was on 4chan when I learned of the fandom anyway.
<djblazekin> of course i'm talking about the screwattack deathbattle vids
<Kammerjunk> Kind of makes it hard to take the content serious.
<Ninjazz|Busy> Barbetos, and I agree with that but you can't control people. All anyone really can do is just be a good example. Hell, if I met the guys that made me rethink my opinion on the fandom first before I saw the porn, I would have joined sooner probably.
<Kammerjunk> seriously*
<RaveBrony> I learned of the fandom After watching the full first season :D
<RaveBrony> And worried i was the only one that liked mlp
<MadSurge> I have a great resistance to those kind of things, so I would have tried to see ponies anyway
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: who were these people thou speakest of?
<djblazekin> i think steve and larson are machinima bronies in secret
<Kammerjunk> I learned of the fandom, then decided to watch the first few episodes. To do so, I went ahead and downloaded all released episodes of S1 in the highest resolution I could find.
<Ninjazz|Busy> MadSurge, funnily enough, all I can remember is one person named "Pinkie Pie".
<Sumica> 00,10twas a nice PS2 run
<Barbetos> Well time to get nakid and wash myself.
<Barbetos> =D
<Sumica> 00,10love me some lib gunning
<Barbetos> i mean.. shower.
<Barbetos> << >>
<Kammerjunk> Uh, beg'yr pard'n, but we don't normally wear clothes.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz|Busy: well, power to them! Spreading the good fandom word and all
<Kammerjunk> In the beginning, there was the Word. And the Word was Faust.
<Ninjazz|Busy> MadSurge, haven't seen them since though... Don't even know if they're even still active.
<Kandarihu> You know what? I'm no stranger to the idea of the worst aspects of one's community supposedly representing the entire group. I'm a big supporter of the Tea Party, and I don't appreciate the small handful of actual racists being made out to represent the vast majority of decent people who just want the government to get out of everyone's face.
<Ninjazz|Busy> That's usually the case in any situation really. :/
<djblazekin> my ex will not even give the show a chance and yet gave the worst game in history a shot and she says mlp fim sucks
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: The worst part of anything is always the loudest, and thus the most known.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I would really say the Word was Bonnie Zacherle :D
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Heretic!
<Kammerjunk> Zacherle was but the a tool for the will of Faust.
<MadSurge> Nay, creationist :D
<Kammerjunk> On a side note, I have no idea what I'm talking about.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: she was the woman who came up with the original My Little Pony concept :)
<Kammerjunk> Oh right, the whole My Pretty Pony thing.
<Kammerjunk> Oh! I -do- know of her!
<Kammerjunk> http://i.imgur.com/mjiBa.jpg
<Kammerjunk> And that's why.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: Funny thing is that she was sad that they ended up being only for girls :D bet she's very happy of the new generation :3
<Kammerjunk> ...I really like her mane.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, as long as that is universal, I think the only good that these stereotypes can do is to play off of each other hypothetically and cancel each other out. However, there are cases where the worst of society really is in charge, and the nicest parts are the exception instead of the rule.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: and yeah, that's an ace picture
<djblazekin> lauren faust is one of my idols alongside craig mccracken and tex avery for cartoon creation and ramika takahashi for manga
<Kammerjunk> David Tennant is my idol for being so damn sexy.
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: 'Tis a sad state of affairs.
<Gold_Demona> Rum! Rum! Rum! Rum!
<Kammerjunk> Man, I love me some Alestorm.
<djblazekin> who is the current incarnation is it david tenent or someone else
<Kammerjunk> djblazekin: It's currently Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor.
<MadSurge> Matt Smith I think?
<Kammerjunk> But don't tell dari that.
<MadSurge> ^
<artist> hi
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, artist
<artist> metal+
<artist> ?
<Kammerjunk> Yup. Alestorm.
<artist> oh wrek, you and your music taste
<Kammerjunk> Metal will overthrow all other genres and gain world domination.
<Jake> drum roll please
<artist> yupp
<djblazekin> surprise i also got knee deep in the fandom after hearing the doctor whooves and the assistant show and reading the first book of shards of equestria then cried my little brony heart after listening to micthemicrophone read my little dashy
<artist> ummmm, what?
<Ninjazz> Maaaan, MLD was such a thing back then.
<Jake> ba-dum http://ragnar95.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Ponies-0-3-332029919
<artist> i've heard that reading too
<CTHULHU> cause of my little dashy i love fanfic now.
<djblazekin> i ment fallout not shards i'm confusing mtg with fallout derp
<artist> i havent read to many good ones
<Kammerjunk> I didn't read FO:E. I'm just too damn lazy.
<djblazekin> fallout equestria is realy good
<artist> you dont have a face!
<Kammerjunk> I'll just be waiting for the FO:E mod for FO3.
<artist> djblazekin: i might read it
<Kammerjunk> And hope they don't cancel it before it's out.
<artist> i've heard silent ponyville is good
<Kandarihu> The fallout over the Ct school shooting has brought out a lot of sterotypes on both sides of the aisle. Progressives are using this to try to ban firearms. Conservatives are blaming it on digital culture. Others are blaming it on any advocacy for the mentally ill. But what I understand about why it happened indicates that the whole motive is much more nuanced.
<artist> k
<djblazekin> but fare warning my gf loves the grimdark fanfics like cupcakes and sweet apple masecre
<artist> sweet apple massecre was ridicoules
<Sumica> 00,10http://tinyurl.com/d6ab4sr

<djblazekin> i showed her the gary's mod animated version of the cupcakes movie and she laughed as poor dashy was being killed
<Pinkieshy> what's the movie from movie night?

<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ef895664de408c4acb878877d24ef1d7.gif She's a professional :D
<artist> professional at what+
<artist> ?
<Kandarihu> Hmm, if the clones can do it, why not the clones?
<Kandarihu> artist, look at the image.
<artist> i diiiiiiiiiiiiid
<djblazekin> artist i think you and my gf would get along as friends she enjoys texas chainsaw masecre, hostile, and saw
<CTHULHU> I can recommend some good fics if anyone interested.

<artist> there are 2? hahaha
<CTHULHU> ok what you want a grimdark or a shipfic?

<Kammerjunk> Ninjazz: What, lie under foam or sleep in the sink?
<Saturn> 08,01note: this actually exists in edinburgh
<Saturn> 08,01Hoody|Skool: i really do
*Saturn 08,01is slightly obsessed with butterflies and moths
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, the foam thing. I can't fit in the sink.
<Ninjazz> ...I think.
<Hoody|Skool> They will float everywhere and you cant see sh*t
<Ninjazz> I mean, I haven't tried.
<Saturn> 08,01Hoody|Skool: i'll be able to see the butterflies
<Saturn> 08,01and they don't float, they fly
<Saturn> 08,01well
<Saturn> 08,01technically they float too
*Saturn 08,01knows this from experience
<Kammerjunk> They're not flying, they're just floating aggressively.
<ouo> Hoody|Skool. then marry me first
<Ninjazz> This can be taken as an act of war from other species.
<Ninjazz> Such as a bird.

<wipergone2> hi
<Deacon> lali-ho wipergone2!
<wipergone2> who has stalker
<Gekoncze> the most confusing thing for me was when I was learning english types of school, because in czech we have: 1. basic school, 2. middle school, 3. high school (or university) and if I remember righ english have 1. basic school, 2. high school, 3. college (or university) is it right?
<Kammerjunk> Get out of here, stalker.
<Gekoncze> and english also have secondary school, but I dont know where it belongs
<wipergone2> lol
<wipergone2> Kammerjunk: hey
<Kammerjunk> Hi.
<wipergone2> Kammerjunk: u got stalker
<wipergone2> >
<wipergone2> ?
<Kammerjunk> Not anymore.
<wipergone2> y
<Kammerjunk> Lost the virtual image.
<wipergone2> u torrented it?
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<wipergone2> how could u
<Kammerjunk> Dosh.
<wipergone2> its underrated
<Prick> everybody say my name! you all love meh! muhahaha
<Kammerjunk> .kcirP
<XAX> .knujremmaK lol
<Flumori> In English a Basic school would be considered an Elementary School
<HavokLappy> Ello :D
<Flumori> which is grades K to 6
<Flumori> Middle School for grades 7-8
<Flumori> Then High School 9-12
<Kammerjunk> L.O.
<Kammerjunk> .XAX
<Flumori> From what I can see czech makes it more simple :P
<Kammerjunk> Wait...
<Deacon> hai there HavokLappy
<HavokLappy> Eyo Deacon :3
<HavokLappy> How're you?
<Gekoncze> yup
<Deacon> just downed some egg nog, doing good, how are ya?
<HavokLappy> I'm fine
<HavokLappy> In bed watching some Scrubs
<Deacon> neato
<Flumori> Do you have grade levels there?
<Flumori> I was just wondering what grade your in
<Gravitar> Just finished my final. How are you guys?
<Deacon> things are swell
<Deacon> and hope you did a great job on it
<Gravitar> Good to hear, mate.
<Gravitar> And thanks. It was easier than I'd expected.
<Bronysith> it looks like ill be getting a vita for christmas...
<Gekoncze> I'm not sure what grade is, we have 9 years (also called something like grades) at basic school, 4 years at middle school and 3 or more years at high school / university
<Gekoncze> I'm in the 4th year of middle (in english high) school
<Gravitar> PC > console gaming.
<XAX> itbegins
<Gekoncze> so next year in October I'll be at university
<Ninjazz> Someone go call Mario and get that theme going.
<Gravitar> What with the inevitably approaching shitstorm, I should get going.
<XAX> b-but...
<Gekoncze> luckilly implementation of the school fees is delayed, so I'll have 1 year free ^^
<XAX> it's to quiet for a shitstorm...
<Deacon> and he left already...
<XAX> I noticed. :<
<Bronysith> there needs to be more games for the vita
<Bronysith> at least my PS1 games i downloaded off the network will carry it XD
<Ninjazz> Sony needs to get their heads out of their ass.
<XAX> >what is a secure PSN
<Bronysith> well at least ill be able to play PErsona 4 golden
<Kammerjunk> "What is this security thou speakest of?" - Sony
<Bronysith> and PSO2
<Bronysith> all on the vita
<Kammerjunk> I still need to get the earlier Persona games.
<Bronysith> with Final fantasy 6,7,8...legend of dragoon
<Ninjazz> Persona doesn't interest me in the slightest.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: persona 3 is kicking my ass
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: die

<Wrek> 05see my point?
<Wrek> 05 /rant
<Kandarihu> I don't think it's practical to block out the titles of upcoming episodes, though. The only thing we can do is move away from Ponychat or something.
<Wrek> 05i got tom on mute now though
<Deacon> ah, basically vague titles are ok then
<Wrek> 05casue im sick of its bullshit

<Alchemist> Im excited about the finale though
<Alchemist> because of the foreshadowing in the premiere
<Alchemist> and the next ep sounds interesting (by title)
<ouo> well first two episodes wasn't so good to make new bronies, but for now it's good asusual c:
<ouo> and i didn't even speak word gak >_>
<Alchemist> I never understood that tbh.
<Alchemist> and I dont want to :D
<ouo> Alchemist, what? What jelly means? :3
<Alchemist> I'd also love a special editin when the whole series will be over.
<Alchemist> the spec ed will have the scenes that didnt make it to the final cut.
<Alchemist> as it seems there are plenty of them
<ouo> hm it will be on dvd only?
<Alchemist> It would be something like a driector's cut.
<ouo> must have it too

<Alchemist> I wont be here much longer either. My head starts to hurt.
<Alchemist> MaxTheBrony: a stream might revive it.
<MaxTheBrony> yah hope so :)

<tumbleweed> dont mind me

<Shizuka> 13texasboykc09: 241 that you know of
<Shizuka> 13it does not count +s
<SlenderManWoods> i love the art
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: +s?
<SpeccyRush> implying most know what +s is Shizuka
<SlenderManWoods> no idea
<Gekoncze> I also wonder why
<SpeccyRush> +s means secret, meaning you ether have to know the name of the channel exactly or be invited
<Spyrorocks> for sitting.
<SlenderManWoods> oh, ok
<texasboykc09> on pony chat ti says that was +k
<Stormy> ooh, pretty
<Stormy> we had snow, but it all melted
<Spyrorocks> "38-Year-Old Little Boy Posts Picture Of Fast Car He Likes To Facebook"
<Shizuka> 13no
<Shizuka> 13+k means the channel has a password
<Gekoncze> same here, the snow melted down
<Spyrorocks> http://www.theonion.com/video/38yearold-little-boy-posts-picture-of-fast-car-he,30632/
<texasboykc09> ok now that i read it right
<texasboykc09> then what does the +tn mean
<Shizuka> 13+t topic can only be changed by operators
<Shizuka> 13+n messages can only be sent to the channel by nicks in that channel

<texasboykc09> ok thanks Shizuka
<Spyrorocks> I idscovered the best drink ever. http://i.imgur.com/BoXxf.jpg
<Spyrorocks> I bought it at this hippy store, and ive had 4 of them since yesterday
<Flumori> what does it taste like?
<Spyrorocks> Kind of like malty grapes
<Spyrorocks> its fizzy
<Spyrorocks> its good. i dont know where else do buy them so i couldn't recommend you a place.
<Flumori> Ive never seen the drink before
<Flumori> could be a brand new drink and only sold locally
<Spyrorocks> i think its some small company that makes them
<Spyrorocks> they are in the usa too, I know 2 places that sell them
<MadSurge> Shizuka: what about tns?
<Shizuka> 13?
<Spyrorocks> maybe whole foods has them im not sure
<Spyrorocks> but seriously you need to try it.
<Spyrorocks> But just get the grape one, the other ones are not as good.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: ah, I see in the link! Secret
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: be that link mods have +o, is it that same mode that phase4 has?
<Shizuka> 13phase as +v voice
<Shizuka> 13means he can talk during +m
<jcelios> speaking of dat wheres Berrypunch? :(
<chrysalis> phase can talk?
<chrysalis> uh oh
<Flumori> Is it supposed to be an energy drink?
<jcelios> Berrypunch is best bot, nice a quiet
<Spyrorocks> Im not sure
<jcelios> now she's gone :'(
<Deacon> :(
<chrysalis> you know who i really miss
<chrysalis> stevenmagnet
<Jmo> isn't Berrypunch and Tom the same bot now?
<Jmo> Cause I'm pretty sure Tom kicks under the alias of Berrypunch.
*jcelios spits on Tom
<SpeccyRush> Berrypunch is a drunk and will kick you cause ya'll deserve it

<Spyrorocks> Hahaha I knew someone would comment with ponies on this article. http://gizmodo.com/5969731/the-cloud-factory
<Jmo> I see no point in doing that.
<jcelios> got kicked by Wrek for that
<Jmo> You'd get kicked by Wrek, then dabi.
<Jmo> Tom/Berrypunch only kicks under special circumstances.
<jcelios> like what?
<SpeccyRush> you missed the point I made entirely, good job
<chrysalis> remember when it was only wrek at 6
<chrysalis> everyone else at 8
<chrysalis> but he kept the message at 8
<Jmo> You'd have to ask Phase for specifics.
<jcelios> If someone is found conspiring against the US government Tom kicks them
<texasboykc09> Jmo: dabi whos that
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, are you looking forward to the next Steam Sale? I hear it's going to start tomorrow.

<killerpony7733> texasboykc09 Well simply said this is a very good remake of the game though it's only part 1 since the team who made it has been working on it for lets just say....alot and lot of years. But the game is simple science happens they test a crystal. It does bad bad things main protagonist is a doctor who knows how to use guns and all that and fights to stop the whole thing and survive
<Buytoast> Even I know that halo don't use no puzzles.

<chrysalis> CriticKitten because they HAVE everything already
<Rocket> hello everybody(pony) guys guys guys GUUUUYS guess what!! i have tableet !
<CriticKitten> Steam sales are like wars: eventually you get so used to them that they don't phase you, and you pretty much only invest in indie games.
<chrysalis> most indie games are pretty crap though
<jcelios> most games*
<chrysalis> far too much effort wasted into art
<AJTheMightyGamer> super meat boy is exception
<chrysalis> no gameplay in them at all
<chrysalis> oh yeah
<Buytoast> don't like super meat boy
<chrysalis> meat boy was great
<gdlk_ouo> is this original or remake?
<chrysalis> and binding of isaac
<chrysalis> also a great game
<The_TCR_Engineer> Since you guys hate meatboy
<AJTheMightyGamer> yep
<The_TCR_Engineer> I HATE IT TOO
<gdlk_ouo> ah see
<The_TCR_Engineer> IT BROKE MY FUCKING SPACE KEY
<AJTheMightyGamer> binding of issac ftw as well
<CriticKitten> Pft, most indie games I've played are great
<Buytoast> i just hate it because it's a bad game
<chrysalis> should of played witha controller
<Michael> lol
<AJTheMightyGamer> thats why yoou play on xbox
<chrysalis> so much better
<CriticKitten> But then, I have this habit of not buying crap
<CriticKitten> Seems to work out well for me
<chrysalis> lol
<chrysalis> that first one was almost comedy into the camera
<chrysalis> no power? better keep those giant fans going
<chrysalis> there are so many places to redirect power from
<CriticKitten> No power? Better hook up with Saturn.
<Buytoast> what part of no power for the tracks did you not quite get?
<chrysalis> CriticKitten not quite
<chrysalis> __________ better hook up with Saturn
<AJTheMightyGamer> AJ?
<AJTheMightyGamer> loljk

<AJTheMightyGamer> so i apparently have something called a ingrown hair and it has become infected. i have to go to the hospital tonight to check on it
<AJTheMightyGamer> brb
<alexxm> sorry to hear that AJTheMightyGamer
<[]DeadpoolDash> I wonder what kind of achievements Steam will add to this once it is downloadable from there
*BroPony|MEDIC is going to go watch freemans mind
<Nittany_Discord> Hey everyone.
<BroPony|MEDIC> hi Nittany_Discord
<alexxm> how are things Nittany_Discord and why are you naked
<Nittany_Discord> I can't find my clothes.
<Stormy> hey Afflict
<[]DeadpoolDash> mythbusters pretty much proved that you are fairly safe from bullets if you are under water
<BroPony|MEDIC> what will happen if your shot underwater?
<Afflict> hey
<thelonepony> BroPony|MEDIC: the bullet wounds will get infected by the waters bacteria
<Afflict> what's up?
<thelonepony> oh and the bullets will look like torpedos underwater
<BroPony|MEDIC> But according to mythbusters and []DeadpoolDash you'll be safe, but how?
<chrysalis> well, the bullets are unlikely to actually get into the water
<chrysalis> they basically shatter on contact with the surface
<chrysalis> and lose all their energy
<BroPony|MEDIC> i see
<[]DeadpoolDash> what chrysalis said
<BroPony|MEDIC> pretty useful info
<chrysalis> basically when water is subjected to a shock like a bullet
<BroPony|MEDIC> getting shot at,
<chrysalis> its basically like concrete
<ScootaDash> hello
<BroPony|MEDIC> go swimming
<chrysalis> and the round shatters
<chrysalis> so what you end up with
<chrysalis> are flakes and shards
<chrysalis> you only have to go a few feet down
<chrysalis> to be safe from handgun rounds
<Yahooz> ugh
<shizumobile> You dissin mah crowbar boy?
<chrysalis> which are the most likely to survive the transition into water
<shizumobile> How about now hmmmm?
<chrysalis> so you guys know feed the beast
<chrysalis> theres going to be a feed the brony version
<chrysalis> on the official launcher
<[]DeadpoolDash> a shot gun slug might be something to worry about too
<Kandarihu> So, why did you kill him?
<Buytoast> Punishment
<Buytoast> for his sins
<jcelios> whats going to be in FTbrony?
<Sumica> 00,10Gordont wont stand for no pussies
<Stormy> nothing really, you?
<Afflict> nothing
<Stormy> heh
<Stormy> It's really quiet here for a weekday :P
<BroPony|MEDIC> brb, Gotta test half life
<chrysalis> its basically feed the beast
<chrysalis> but with mine little pony
<[]DeadpoolDash> but the high velocity rounds from most rifles would break up on impact with the water
<chrysalis> and a couple of other tweaks
<pony_8759> yup
<pony_8759> Who is ready for the new episode !!! of mlp :DD 2 days !!!
<chrysalis> also, rumours of rp3 world gen
<chrysalis> and the rest coming soon

<pony_8759> its called BRONYSTATE BRONY <-----
<Buytoast> BRONYstate
<thelonepony> pony_8654: but we dont stream ponies 24/7 anon
<Buytoast> not HORSEstate
<flutterfan99> brony state is and i quote "not pony upsest"
<Flumori> hey
<String_Shredder> pony_8759: Not everyone wants ponies all the time.
<Stormy> Hi

<Yahooz> now go away if you dont like it
<Buytoast> but YOU are a true nuisance
<jcelios> well you aint a true scotsmen either
<Shizuka> 13pony_8759: If you're going to be a jackass you can leave.
<Ryunosuke> bronies have more interests than JUST ponites
<flutterfan99> true bronys don't spend all there time watching ponys
<Ryunosuke> *ponies
<String_Shredder> Maybe we are true bronies. Maybe you're just too obsessed, pony_8759
<Flumori> umm I ment if you still have more classes before the semester ends
<Stormy> ohh
<Yahooz> real men watch G3 bro
<Stormy> lol
<Dr> so whats up im new
<pony_8759> haah G3
<Stormy> then never mind :P
<Afflict> I am
<Ryunosuke> real bronies watch sea ponies too :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> pony_8759: i like ponies as much as the next guy, but damnit i need a break here and there
<flutterfan99> go play a video games or watch dr. who like us

<Shizuka> 13lul then bms crashes
<String_Shredder> Plus, ponies are so gay and not MLG L3G1T. Scoots would agree with me there.
<Stormy> how long do you get for break?
<Yahooz> Derp_Derp: no! DEY TOOK ER JERBS
<Kandarihu> The only definition of a true brony is one who likes My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and enough to watch every episode. And the people who are more hardcore than that can't honestly strip the less hardcore of the brony label.
<Scootadash> hello
<pony_8759> nigga,you gay
<XxNightHawk64xX> String_Shredder: queso
<Buytoast> welp

<Buytoast> we get a long break
<Buytoast> but we get no spring break
<thelonepony> well, that sucks
<BroPony|MEDIC> Buytoast: Lucky, mine starts tomorrow and ends on January 2nd
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya again :

<Scoot-Scootaloo> A 24/7 pony stream
<Scootadash> thanks
<BroPony|MEDIC> Scoot-Scootaloo: He was a mad man
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Well... it looks like I can fix that
<Shizuka> 13get to it
<String_Shredder> Scoot-Scootaloo: He doesn't understand the un-MLGness of ponies.
<thelonepony> D:
<Yahooz> Scoot-Scootaloo: Yes please?
<Shizuka> 13they made my black mesa crash because of it
<jcelios> uh oh...
<herobrine> must kill notch
<BroPony|MEDIC> G3.5 Inbound
<Shizuka> 13herobrine: Must stop RPing.
<[]DeadpoolDash> i sense some monkey's paw bullshit about to happen...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> If this gentlemen oh so wants a pony stream..
<Shizuka> 13Bronystate is not your personal roleplaying channel.
<herobrine> .....what that?
<Buytoast> honestly, if the mayans believed cortez was a god, believeing their ass backwards doomsday theory is a bit dunderheaded
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Well, you know our motto, we deliver~
*BroPony|MEDIC sits in corner
<String_Shredder> must kick herobrine
<Yahooz> Prepare for mass jimmy rustling
<herobrine> no
<Buytoast> MURIKANS deliver no matter what.
*chrysalis prepares his jimmies
<String_Shredder> yes
<Yahooz> lol he doesnt even know what RP is
<BroPony|MEDIC> awwww
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Buytoast: That was Aztecs. Aztecs believed he was a God. The Mayans left for some reason
<Buytoast> well shit
<Buytoast> there goes my knowlege
<Shizuka> 13everyone horribly confuses the aztecs, the mayans, and the inca
<BroPony|MEDIC> the spanish took over the mayans didnt they?
<Buytoast> which ones made the flaoting island farms?
<Buytoast> those the aztecs too?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> >confusing Aztec/Mayans with Incas

<BroPony|MEDIC> idk
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I weep for you ;_;
<[]DeadpoolDash> butts
<Yahooz> well the Aztecs were a violent bunch, the Mayans were super advanced and shit, and the Incas... well, no one cares for them much
<Flumori> Is that why you dont have laptop on your name?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Because this talk is MLG
<Spyrorocks> yep
*alexxm steall []DeadpoolDash's butt

<Buytoast> THE INCAS ARE STINCAS

<Flumori> :\
<Brad_> the video is actually quite stable

<thelonecubone> lol, flash crash on me
<twilight_sprinkle> happens to me all the time
<thelonecubone> Not complaining much
<thelonecubone> i am using a old computer
<texasboykc09> thelonecubone: that happens to me for no reason
<thelonecubone> texasboykc09: I believe flash depends on cpu or ram
<thelonecubone> not sure tbh xD
<Brad_> Flumori, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nev5QGNPTBg
*Flumori clicks
<Unnr> flash *tends* to be a CPU hog
<thelonecubone> ah
<texasboykc09> Unnr: by what i read it does
<thelonecubone> well that explains it
<Flumori> how long does the charge last? or is it gas?
<CrystalPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, here's MY type of desktop http://fav.me/d4etdqo
<CrystalPhoenix> a mood settling scenery
<Brad_> 15 minutes
<Brad_> battery
<Stormy> lol I like your youtube name
<CrystalPhoenix> Though I have to admit, I'm a sucker for pictures like that
<Unnr> texasboykc09: not always, but usually, in some cases ram plays a larger role, and in others its bound by the video card
<Stormy> "MrBrad3344"
<CrystalPhoenix> when it focus on the landscape
<Ponies47> Hello everypony :3
<Brad_> I just throw random videos on that account.
<twilight_sprinkle> i sometimes like those kind too, but i prefer stuff with stars, its nice because its pretty and not distracting
<texasboykc09> Unnr: ok when i wish it say why it crashes
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Ponies47! :)
<texasboykc09> hello Ponies47
<thelonecubone> Hi Ponies47 :3

<texasboykc09> CrystalPhoenix: like the picture
<CrystalPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, you mean like the picture I just put up?
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: i mean i like those too, but tend to put stuff with stars or lightning storms or junk like that
<CrystalPhoenix> I hate it when it's put randomly
<twilight_sprinkle> i never see my desktop anyway because i always have something open
<CrystalPhoenix> and holy shit this http://fav.me/d57x29n
<Flumori> video is ok, it does get old after a little while
<DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/iKN4y
<Flumori> but the view is nice
<Brad_> thats why I said it was lame.
<texasboykc09> CrystalPhoenix: that looks awesome
<Brad_> you were warned.
<Brad_> Only good part is when I point it at myself. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Nev5QGNPTBg#t=219s

<Stormy> who's the other person?
<flutterfan99> just cause 2
<CrystalPhoenix> I hate saying really two time in one sentence
<Brad_> my brother.
<Unnr> CrystalPhoenix: This is when the word ¨honestly¨ becomes useful
<Stormy> I think the video needs more ponies
<CrystalPhoenix> I'll keep that in mind
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355963196496.jpg have some chrysallis cosplay
<CrystalPhoenix> I've seen sexier ones
<gamax92> Hey whats sup everyone
<Brad_> its got one partial pony.
*Brad_ has hat on there.
<Bronysith> well chrysallis isnt sexy to begin with
<Bronysith> so not that hard
<gamax92> Just broke a Windows 7 machine completly
<gamax92> accidently corrupted a few drivers, then the power went out.
<Flumori> Stormy don't be giving him ideas >.>
<jcelios> "accidently corrupted a few drivers"?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, oh yeah you weren't the one obsesses with her....come to think of it where is that guy
<CrystalPhoenix> Metroid something
<Bronysith> she isnt sexy
<Stormy> :P
<Bronysith> but the cosplayers somehow make her sexy
<Stormy> haters gonna hate
<XAX> Considering how extremely tedious the Black Ops 2 emblem maker is, I was impress when I saw this in my lobby. http://i.imgur.com/8eZbc.png
<Barbetos> Adultswim and TF2
<Barbetos> Wow.
<DeadpoolDash> http://derpy.me/0Ku4R
<Barbetos> seems legit
<XAX> DeadpoolDash: Jesus.
<Barbetos> gona give your love to her?
<Barbetos> EH?
<XAX> That's impressive.
<Barbetos> EEEEHHHHHH?
<Brad_> salmon pepperoni... interesting..
<otakon> hiya all
<otakon> anything happening?
<Barbetos> nope
<DeadpoolDash> pretty much all of Yaya Han's cosplay is impressive
<texasboykc09> holle otakon
<XAX> hi otakon. i'm admiring this gentlemen's emblem making ability. http://i.imgur.com/8eZbc.png
<Barbetos> Humble Bundle 7 I suppose
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai otakon :)
<otakon> XAX: nice I bet [SWAG]Haku made that if Iwere to put forth a guess
<thelonecubone> Hi otakon :)
<otakon> hiya thelonecubone, MLP_Brovakiin, texasboykc09
<XAX> otakon: b-but... the name of the player is at the bottom...
<XAX> oh.
<otakon> XAX: Haku
<XAX> it says haku.
<otakon> seriously what are the chances of a Derpy badge on a player named Haku while there is ALSO a Haku that comes here?
<XAX> see it's 1:36pm and i got up half an hour ago, a-and...
<otakon> yeah yeah
<otakon> solution: Drink more coffee
<otakon> MOAR COFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, well Haku is a character i Naruto
<CrystalPhoenix> soooooooooooooooo
<otakon> CrystalPhoenix: yeah but Haku isn't a uncommon name in anime
<otakon> HOWEVER
<CrystalPhoenix> then again the character is pretty minor and has been killed very early
<CrystalPhoenix> wait I forgot
<otakon> a Haku that likes MLP AND goes to the trouble to make a VERY good badge of DERPY I think takes notice
<CrystalPhoenix> is Haku a girl or a boy?
<otakon> boy that looks SO much like a girl it's scary
<CrystalPhoenix> Anime man
<otakon> Seriously, Haku DEFINED "trap" for Naruto
<CrystalPhoenix> even Naruto was shocked
<otakon> no, he was BEYOND Bishonen
<otakon> he was a straight up trap
<CrystalPhoenix> Zabuza was such a cool antagonist
<CrystalPhoenix> shame he had to be the first
<otakon> well God
<twilight_sprinkle> reminds me of that kid from shaman king, one of the characters was hitting on him until he found out he was a he
<otakon> he's a MOOK compared to what they're fighting now
<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, I am aware and I don't like them
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: was it Ryu? The one with the pompadour?
<otakon> I liked his character arc
<KaiserVordox> <--- I see Sumi and Shizu took some atleast. :D
<CrystalPhoenix> too farfetch'd
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: ye
<Shizuka> 13?
<otakon> I KNEW IT
<otakon> hiya Shizuka what's up chicken butt?
<Shizuka> 13[18:44] [ KaiserVordox] <--- I see Sumi and Shizu took some atleast. :D
<Shizuka> 13?
<KaiserVordox> Some of the pictures I posted with Christmas theme
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah i remember how in the beginning naruto was like "omg visible chakra thats so incredible" now they have giant chakra skeletons shooting chakra arrows
<CrystalPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, that's why Naruto got lame to me
*Kipkat07_Scarf flips his desk, lights his computer on fire, and punches several holes in the wall
<Kipkat07_Scarf> THE LAST FUCKING LEVEL
<CrystalPhoenix> it's so farfetch'd it became iritable
<CrystalPhoenix> Orochimaru was pretty much my limit
<thelonecubone> hey hey hey. Kipkat07_Scarf get some Tequila to calm down man
<XAX> CrystalPhoenix: it was pretty krabby
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: yeah they just went and resurrected everyone like it was nothing
<CrystalPhoenix> cause heh a main villain character always need something unrealisticaly incredible
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I cant beat FTL.... I make it to the last fucking level, the ship is almost destroyed, and my ship expldes.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
<Bronysith> so
<CrystalPhoenix> but now EVERYONE has something unrealistically incredible
<Bronysith> whos ready for zombies?
<Bronysith> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: still, i did enjoy the manga until pains death, pain was an amaing character
<CrystalPhoenix> so yeah that's why I don't like Naruto
<twilight_sprinkle> *amazing
<Bronysith> naruto sucks
<XAX> Bronysith: I'm too busy with multiplayer at the moment
<CrystalPhoenix> Naruto was cool with the first series
<CrystalPhoenix> like actual ninja in training going to school and shit
<Bronysith> naruto sucks
<CrystalPhoenix> that was fun
*Kipkat07_Scarf lays down crying and falls asleep
<twilight_sprinkle> and the tests they had were great too
<twilight_sprinkle> especially where they all had to cheat to pass
<CrystalPhoenix> basically it's like dragonball
<Bronysith> nah
<CrystalPhoenix> the first series was amzing
<Bronysith> dragonball is much better than naruto
<CrystalPhoenix> but then the second one came
<CrystalPhoenix> aaaaaaaaaaaaaand yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> I guess it was good for action
<Bronysith> the original dragonball was wonderful
<twilight_sprinkle> still, minus the fillers i found the anime enjoyable, but they shove fillers as memories in every ep now so i gave up on that
<CrystalPhoenix> if you call screaming at the top of your lung being action scenes
*Kipkat07_Scarf crawls to his kitchen to eat himself into a coma of self-pity
<twilight_sprinkle> and the manga was good until pain died, now its going downhill as well
<Major> Ello
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Major
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Major :>
<DeadpoolDash> zombie ninjas, yes they went there
<CrystalPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, I'll say alot of BS right now but
*Bronysith carries twilight_sprinkle to bed for some "training"
<texasboykc09> hello Major
<thelonecubone> Hi Major
<CrystalPhoenix> Naruto will end up with Sasuke in romance
*Kipkat07_Scarf is sick :<
<CrystalPhoenix> if that ever happen
<CrystalPhoenix> I wouldn't even be surprised
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kipkat07_Scarf: I hope you feel better soon buddy! ^-^
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: well, they already kissed :P
<CrystalPhoenix> WHAT
<Bronysith> id rather get into Evangelion shipping over naruto shipping
<CrystalPhoenix> in joke right?
<Bronysith> afterall, naruto has horrible fans
<twilight_sprinkle> but i used to be a naruto fan :<
<Bronysith> just like Bronies or homestucks or helliates or skyrimmers
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: it was in th e2nd ep
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: not my fault they are terrible fans
<twilight_sprinkle> *the 2nd
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah
<CrystalPhoenix> accident
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MLP_Brovakiin: Well playing FTL doesnt help. I died on the last level and almost punched a hole in my monitor.
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: thats where it all starts~
<DeadpoolDash> all fandoms have terrible fans
<CrystalPhoenix> yeah that doesn't count
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kipkat07_Scarf: Ouch :I
<Major> Bronysith, i always knew you were horrible :P
<CrystalPhoenix> By the way guys
<twilight_sprinkle> still, one thing naruto was always great was the tricks they used to defeat enemies, it was pretty clever and even used a bit of physics at times
*Bronysith takes CrystalPhoenix to bed
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/70734/something-like-feeling pretty cool story
<Kipkat07_Scarf> MLP_Brovakiin: It hurt. I had invested about two hours into that single save file.
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, I'm RP-proof
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it took the yugioh approach with super fucking long overly complicated shit
<twilight_sprinkle> i like overcomplicated stuff
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: like, 5 seconds of action, then 30 minutes of explaining it
<twilight_sprinkle> gives something to think about
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kipkat07_Scarf: I hate it when that happens :1
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: not that there is anything wrong with explanations, but theres such a thing where it hypes up the fight and then it only lasts 5 seconds
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: looking at you gaara vs rock lee
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: that battle was amazing though, even if i must admit they most likely took the idea of lees weights from somewhere else, possibly dbz
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: well masashi kishimoto was heavily inspired by dbz
<otakon> well shite
<otakon> just near EVERYTHIGN is inspired by DBZ
<otakon> everything*
*Bronysith takes otakon to bed
<twilight_sprinkle> pfff
*otakon goes intangilbe
<Bronysith> otakon: i think Evangelion has had alot of inspiration too...right?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well narutos character was, other than that i dont think there was much taken from it
<CrystalPhoenix> otakon, Tokyo mew mew was based off Sailor Moon
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: okay let me rephrase
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: everything with lots of FIGHTING is practically inspired by DBZ
<otakon> Naruto. Bleach, One Piece
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: only the light shows
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, but i didnt care for the characters in naruto, it was just one huge ship fest XD
<Major> Bronysith, you have to argue about everything don't ya?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, you wanna know a bigger shipfest?
<Bronysith> Major: um, this isnt arguing
<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: hetallia?
<Bronysith> MLP?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and the powering up? and the getting stronger through INSANE training regiments? Yu Yu Hakusho gets inspiration for DBZ
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: idk, pain was one the most amazing characters ive ever seen, and his philosophies could really work
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: oh god, pain
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ooh, what about itachi?
<Bronysith> itachi was tragic
<Kipkat07_Scarf> My school did pictures for the clubs in my school and I managed to miss 90% of my Algebra class :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: itachi was pretty cool too, but what i really like about pain is that his philosophies could actually be applied irl
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i didnt watch yu yu hakusho
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, what were his philosophies again? i havent seen that shit in forever
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well you should
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: good show
<Bronysith> otakon: how much shit has evangelion inspired?
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, you're good
*Kipkat07_Scarf feels like he's going to throw up ;~;
<otakon> Bronysith: not sure, ask RX
<CrystalPhoenix> PASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Major> Kipkat07_Scarf, take deep breaths
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: basically that pain could unite the world. pain is one of the basic human feelings, something that often controls their behavior. it could be used for good
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but thats very basically
<twilight_sprinkle> theres more to it
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: oh yea, he was the head of akatsuki right?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> FUCK!!! I forgot to work on my lab report
<DeadpoolDash> almost all modern mecha anime has some sort of Eva influences in it
<Bronysith> DeadpoolDash: and gundam of course
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well, SPOILERS AHEAD he wasnt truly the head
<texasboykc09> Kipkat07_Scarf: better go do it
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he was made to think he was
<Bronysith> DeadpoolDash: even though the Evas arent actually robots >.>
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: holy shit
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: im pretty gay for tragic characters though, thats why i love itachi and zuko
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: well, actually it depends on what you mean by leader, he actually was aware of the secret plan of akatsuki, but not of everything about himself
<Bronysith> and also of course, THE man, Andrew Ryan
<DeadpoolDash> still, alot of the mecha genre uses design and various character types from Eva
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: naruto has truckloads of tragic characters, there were almost no purely evil characters there at all :D
<CrystalPhoenix> they all had motive
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, and also, steve blum is great as orochimaru
<CrystalPhoenix> (most of them being village raid
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hm, didnt know it was him. orochimaru has some great themes too
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, but i dont like how he talks, too, fucking calm
<Bronysith> he never raises his voice XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalPhoenix: well, they Were born during a war, which they understand, and another great theme of the show is the circle of hate thing
<twilight_sprinkle> i like how kakashi is still alive, not OP at all, but hes one of the most useful characters still
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i like how he was a jonin at 12 or some shit like that
<Bronysith> and also how he watched his best friend die in front of him
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: or even 9 or something
<Bronysith> holy shit he went through alot of stuff
<CrystalPhoenix> Screw MLP merchendise I'll go victorian now http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/watches.php
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: actually it turned out to be ever twistier than watching his friend die
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: what actually happened is SPOILERS IJQINDMIQOWNMDQ he killed his friend
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he pushed the boulder ontop of obito?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: oh you meant obito, well no, he didnt. but he killed his other teammate
<Bronysith> christ kakashi
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he got surrounded and it was the only way to protect the data, so he killed her, and its even twistier than that
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: jesus fuckign christ
<Bronysith> okay
<Bronysith> Kakashi, is a worse person than gendo ikari
<twilight_sprinkle> idk, i somewhat agree with what he did, he chose the village over 1 person, it made sense
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he pulled a spock XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: never watched startreck much :P
<Bronysith> needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> yep
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: thats all i know of the original series of star trek XD
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: well that and "KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN"
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i saw a few eps as a kid but dont remember much
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i need to watch the next generation >.>
<sub06905> ello everypony :$
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: also, when kakashi killed his teammate, he pretty much became the reason for the war
<thelonecubone> Hi sub06905 :)

<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, do you have a PS2?

<Bronysith> CrystalPhoenix: of course it doesnt XD
<thelonecubone> I need to get PS3 ;3;
<thelonecubone> and a better computer as well
<CrystalPhoenix> Bronysith, be careful about what you're saying

<thelonecubone> damn, now you reminded me that i need to watch it
<SpeccyRush> implying sumi is trolling
<DerpyMuffins> You just watched it now Sumica?
<CriticKitten> Though the goblin CGI is pretty bleh, that much is true.
<Sumica> 00,10too damn long and they never even finishe what they start out to do.
<Ponies47> Sumi troll is best troll
<CriticKitten> So it's just like Fellowship then?
<CriticKitten> *zing*
<Sumica> 00,10nah lower mortality rate
<CriticKitten> Well, do any of those damn dwarves die in the book?
<XAX> Sumica: They spent long enough filming it here.
<CriticKitten> I can't even remember
<Sumica> 00,10they totaly riped off lord of the rings too.
<CriticKitten> 'cuz I could do without about half of them
<Sumica> 00,10they did't even try to hide it
<Sumica> 00,10useing like the same names and shit

<twilight_sprinkle> this remind me of anecdote which is too long to type out
<Sumica> 00,10my only complant is wtf do they put in the soda to make me have to pee so damn much
<KaiserVordox> ^ Dat image pretty good
<CriticKitten> Too long, they end up making almost no real visible progress, and it's a mix of long character development and action slashed together.
<Bronysith> Sumica: me
<flutterchu> I HOPE IM JACKNJELIFY'S 5,00TH SUBSCRIBER!!!!!!
<CriticKitten> All of which were things that Fellowship did. So....I thought it was pretty par for the course. But the goblin CGI....why.
<Barbetos> Waynebradeygonahavetochokeabitch
<flutterchu> Oh please Celestia can i be That Person
<Barbetos> Sumica They put pee in your soda.
<Bronysith> flutterchu: im sure it would be easier to ask molestia
<CriticKitten> The Uruk-Hai were BAWS. Why you use visibly weaker CGI for goblins. D:

<otakon> Sumica: wrong thing?
<Stallion_of_War> I doubt little Timmy would get a battleaxe for Christmas otakon.
<RoboGerbil> i can say ive never saw this movie

<Kandarihu> mikebond3401, I think I'd prefer to hear Christmas Power Metal
<Darf14> hmm....to be honest I dont recall which "Ooo" the episode came from, sorry I couldnt help :(
<mikebond3401> lawl
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica oooh, putting that in my wallpaper rotation
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but then super took over, I was just doing filler till he was ready
<caligulasAquarium> muppets.
<mikebond3401> WHOEVER CAN ANSWER THIS GETS 3 HUGS
<mikebond3401> What two forces influence the movement of earth’s plates?
<caligulasAquarium> KERMIT FROG
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: oh ok, woops :$

<Darf14> Kermit!
<Kurra> Dat 80s audio fidelity, horrible D:
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: oh, i thought only wrek had that
<Kencolt> One thing about this song-- Someone has some VERY VERY odd ideas about gift giving.
<Kandarihu> John Denver and the Muppets. This... isn't quite as familiar to me.
<Darf14> 5 gold rings? She must got them from sonic
*Kurra confesses that one of the things that scared him most as a child, and still gives him massive shivers, is old audio that warbles and wavers and sounds horrible, it actually causes him fear
<twilight_sprinkle> and gnomes on a pine treeee~
<mikebond3401> i crashed
<Vordox> Noone knows? D:
<Innate> trick question
<Innate> it's all gnomes
<Kandarihu> AND A PEAR ON A PARTRIDGE TREE!
<J_E_Smith71> BAMUP BUM BUM
<djblazekin> 12 days of ponies
<Darf14> Fail
<Kandarihu> Fozzie's forgetting his lines
<J_E_Smith71> And here come the old geezers to make fun of him
<Darf14> Hmm...we need to make a pony version of 12 days of christmas
<Shizuka> 13but i already played the john denver muppets :<
<Innate> all matter is made up of tiny gnomes, the movement of the "tectonic plates" is actually a giant rock concert where surface gnomes crowd-surf on the excited magma gnomes
<Sumica> 00,10you had better sound Shizuka but this has video
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Scrubs version?
<Innate> you can sometimes hear these concerts when two of these groups mash up together, and the bands just start to "jam", this causes and uproar in sound and the motion of the gnomes which we experience as an earthquake
<Kandarihu> Innate, that first one made my mom laugh... me to.
<Sumica> 00,10ow my ears
<Darf14> OMG Starwars Christmas Special! KILL IT :O

<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, you mean the result of many Kerbal deaths
<Sumica> 00,10all those power packs
<the_real_pony_1604> their bodies were donated to science
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, that too
<Sumica> 00,10lawl

<Sumica> 00,10seems stable
<Phase4> 00,02clearly i must launch two space stations to balance it out
<the_real_pony_1604> looks like a robot holding something
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's not working cause that bit is already a coupler
<Sumica> 00,10I cant even land on the moon with out cratoring
<Sumica> 00,10and here you are seting up for a space station

<aniderp|bestcakeever> its a disability bus
<aniderp|bestcakeever> xD
<KrazyNoobs> I know when Wrek and Sumica are streaming by the icons, I just think all the streaming admins should use some sort of icon that indicates who is streaming.

<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: I did play that game incidentally :D
<Gold_Demona> And then all your base are belong to KATS
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, is the game actually any good? :D
<Gold_Demona> Yeah actually
<Gold_Demona> It's one of those top0view spaceship shooters
<Gold_Demona> top-view*
<AdamTheDuck> I might check it out later
<Gold_Demona> With the self-scrolling levels and the waves of bafd guys to shoot
<Gold_Demona> bad*
*AdamTheDuck moves the ZIG
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: actually it's side view, kinda like R-Type
<Gold_Demona> That's the ship you're flying in the game. a Zig :D
<Gold_Demona> Oh yeah, it's side-view. Same gameplay though
<Gold_Demona> Just horizontal instead of vertical
<MadSurge> Yeah, it's a decent shooter
<MadSurge> The guys that made it, Toaplan, eventually became Cave and invented bullet hell games :D
<Gold_Demona> I think it's be one of those horribly forgotten games if not for the terrible translation in the intro. XD
<Gold_Demona> it'd*
<Gold_Demona> All them typoes this morning
*AdamTheDuck makes Gold_Demona a coffee :P
<Gold_Demona> Glad I'm not writing any fic right now, or I'd have typoes everywhere. :D
<Gold_Demona> Ooh! Coffee!
*Gold_Demona drinks da coffee
<Gold_Demona> Sankyoo Ducky. :)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ever tried italian coffee? Tiny cups, but gives a hell of a kick I'm told :D
<Gold_Demona> Like espresso? :D
<MadSurge> Ayup
<Gold_Demona> Never had espresso. Don't really need that much caffeine. XD
<MadSurge> Drink that coffee in an American cup and you won't be able to sleep :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Sleep?
<AdamTheDuck> What is sleep?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah espresso is typically served in a shot cup. XD
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: it's the action of laying down and closing your eyes :D
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Alchemist> ohai
<AdamTheDuck> If that's what sleep is, I do that with my eyes open
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Alchemist
<Gold_Demona> No, sleep is an acid trip minus the acid. :D
<Alchemist> I passed an exam yesterday
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Yay!~ Congrats
<AdamTheDuck> Awesome, which exam Alchemist? :P
<Alchemist> Part of the exam was to turn in a paper. Out of the 25 points I got 30. My paper was 20% cooler :D
<Alchemist> Polymer chemistry and technology
<MadSurge> Are there achievements in PS2?
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, none at the moment
<MadSurge> Oh
<AdamTheDuck> Don't think they are going to add any though
<Alchemist> its a shame that PS2 is a bit more demanding than an average game
<MadSurge> Alchemist: you rock! Woohoo! :)
<AdamTheDuck> The developers said they wanted to put most of their time into fixing bugs rather than adding new content
<Alchemist> MadSurge: thx :)
<AdamTheDuck> Alchemist, indeed, it's very unoptimised at the moment.
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh, and I forgot to say congratulations Alchemist :P
<Alchemist> AdamTheDuck: most people say that it was okay during the beta. What changed?
<Alchemist> and thanks :)
<KrazyNoobs> im baaaack
<KrazyNoobs> wait
<KrazyNoobs> brb
<AdamTheDuck> Alchemist, more people? .-. Not sure, I don't notice much change fromt he beta
*Kipkat07_Scarf parachutes into the chat, violently sick
*AdamTheDuck violently throws his rusty kitchen knife at parachuting Kipkat07_Scarf
<Kipkat07_Scarf> uughhhhhh I dont like being sick :<
<Alchemist> I thought that in an online game more players only tax the bandwith and not the processor performance. (Im a retard when it comes to comp tech so I dont know).
<Gold_Demona> I think I'll have some coffee for real. brb
<AdamTheDuck> Alchemist, yes, but to load that many people on a screen at once can put a strain on the performance
<AdamTheDuck> ponyshrug.jpg
<XAX> yum.
<AdamTheDuck> Like I said, I don't really notice a difference in performance since beta
<XAX> I haven't had lift+ in a while.
<XAX> quite a while...
<Alchemist> doesnt matter, I should get a new PC anyways if I want to play with any game that came out past 2010 :D
<XAX> Alchemist: My old desktop can't run anything past 2006
<XAX> STEP IT UP
<Alchemist> XAX: yeah, too bad I dont have ~1000$ for a decent config. :(
<XAX> :(
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I'm going to have to miss school because of this fucking sickness :(
<AdamTheDuck> Kipkat07_Scarf, isn't that a good thing? :P
<Alchemist> Kipkat07_Scarf: is that good or bad?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> not in high school
<Kipkat07_Scarf> and I have two labs I have to do today and teh lab report is due tomorrow
<Alchemist> what kind of labs?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> chemistry
<Alchemist> :)
*aniderp|bestcakeever hops around the chat like a bunny rabbit
<Gold_Demona> Making zap apple jam, aniderp|bestcakeever?
*Kipkat07_Scarf lays down and groans because he wants to throw up but cant
<Alchemist> I ate a rabbit once.
<Alchemist> wasnt that asty
<Alchemist> tasty
<aniderp|bestcakeever> maybe :P
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: I've always wanted to try rabbit. What's it taste like?
<AdamTheDuck> Does it taste like chicken? :$
<Alchemist> It tasted more like boar meat if you ever tried that.
<AdamTheDuck> I wonder what human tastes like
*AdamTheDuck nibbles on Jaymoo's arm
<Alchemist> But the bunny it was from was old and maybe that was the problem.
<MadSurge> Rabbit is quite good, but I prefer sticking to steaks
<Alchemist> Chicken and turkey for me. Maybe a well done steak on occasions.
<Alchemist> and potatoes
<Alchemist> in any form
<Alchemist> and quantity
<AdamTheDuck> Potatoes
<Alchemist> mmmmmm
<AdamTheDuck> Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew
<Kipkat07_Scarf> turky is nom
<Gold_Demona> Sadly the only meats I've had are chicken, turkey, pork, and beef.
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: no seafood?
<AdamTheDuck> I also want to try kangaroo one day o.o
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: I wasn't sure if you counted seafood
<aniderp|bestcakeever> sea ponies!
<Gold_Demona> in that category I've had all kinds of stuff
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: well, its technically meat too.
*aniderp|bestcakeever grabs Gold_Demona to dance
<Gold_Demona> Technically, but some folks for some reason don't count seafood as meat. :P
<Alchemist> I didnt know that. Strange.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: wanna muffin?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: sure =D
<Alchemist> So it's wild animal meat you want to try or something more exotic?
<AdamTheDuck> There are some vegetarians who eat seafood because they don't consider it as meat
<MadSurge> Ikr, fish are made of meat
*aniderp|bestcakeever gives muffin and puts sea ponies on
<Alchemist> AdamTheDuck: what? thats nonsense.
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Pretty much anything that isn't the four meats I've mentioned. I love all four of them, but I wanna try all kinds of other meats.
<Gold_Demona> Meat is an expensive commodity though. =/
<AdamTheDuck> I want to eat veal again
<Alchemist> Only the good kind is expensive
<Gold_Demona> never had veal. Just regular beef
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i want pizza rolls or a hot dog
<AdamTheDuck> I have no idea what animal veal is, but damn it was good
<Kipkat07_Scarf> tortured little baby cow
<Gold_Demona> veal is baby cows
<Alchemist> AdamTheDuck: baby cow
<AdamTheDuck> D:
<Alchemist> :D
<AdamTheDuck> Not baby Ess Bee's! D:

<CriticKitten> As for me, I've been coughing so much from this flu that my throat's starting to feel like it's been flayed repeatedly.
<CriticKitten> It's kinda painful, even with pain meds in my system. >.<
<CriticKitten> The flu sucks and should go die.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Ive been coughing too >_< If I cough when I vomit... projectile vomiting /).(\
<Kipkat07_Scarf> DO. NOT. WANT.
*JRP2234 hugs SuperBrony64
<CriticKitten> Still going to work though. I refuse to let this goddamn bug keep me in bed all week. Who the hell does this flu think I am?!? :|
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I wish I could go to school but I dont want to be the person who throws up all over the keyboard in computer tech
<CriticKitten> Oh, speaking of work, it's that time.
<CriticKitten> Yeah, probably best to wait until you've broken your fever at least.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye CriticKitten

*Kipkat07_Scarf re-reads his comment.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> damnit.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> maybe the fact that I havent eaten in three days is responsible for my flu...
<Mutterguy> drinking plenty of fluids?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: I saw your Mooooo :D
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Mutterguy: not really :\

<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: If anything? Hell if I know. P:
<oni_link> tanks look fun as hell
<Gold_Demona> I'm kinda hard to shop for, so I'd be surprised if anybody got me anything. :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> does your husband usually get you something?
<Alchemist> If in doubt buy a whip. Worked for me.
<Gold_Demona> Plus most folks who usually buy me stuff are kinda po' right now, so I don't think I'd want them getting me anything anyhow.
<oni_link> Well okay o.o
<oni_link> haha
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: He does when he can find anything to give me. :P
<Gold_Demona> Like I said, I'm hard to shop for
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ponies? :D
<Gold_Demona> I already have all the ponies I want that don't involve killing your wallet. XP
<ouo> aww please link me doomsday this neat doomsday counter site :)
<Alchemist> oh I forgot that its apocalypse tomorrow :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i give you a muffin card

<Mutterguy> Gold_Demona i'm gonig to a potluck AND a party
<Gold_Demona> Muffin card is perfect

<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: Sounds awesome =D
<Gold_Demona> That's what I'm going to call American football from now on. not-football.
<oni_link> lol
<Mutterguy> It's true. It's more West Atlantic Rugby
<TrixieMuffin> still like Handegg
<Gold_Demona> I've seen Rugby. Rugby is INSANE by comparison. o_o
<ouo> aww here it is
<ouo> http://www.terriblefate.com/
<Gold_Demona> I can't follow Rugby at all
<Gold_Demona> not-football makes sense to me, so I enjoy watching it.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: i got a question for you
<Alchemist> According to which timezone will it be apocalypse tomorrow?
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: shoot
<oni_link> How often can this armor be selected?
<Mutterguy> its CST
<XAX> http://i.imgur.com/aDYLE.jpg

<aniderp|bestcakeever> um well is there gonna be non football game on chirstmas eve? D:
<Alchemist> And will it be midnight tonight, or noon tomorrow or what?
<Mutterguy> Yeah belize runs on UCT +6

<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: No particular time. Just the day
<Gold_Demona> The whole day
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it will be the longest apocalypse ever :D
<Alchemist> :| At least they could have been more specific. How should i know when to pop the champagne?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eeyup :D

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: anyway, AJ episode :3

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yay, AJ! Think she'll finally get her own song? =D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: maybe :)

<Gold_Demona> Mutterguy: Good idea. Sleep through the apocalypse. :3
<Alchemist> and you wont ever wake up
<oni_link> Im gonna do the same XD

<oni_link> I think I've finally met someone who likes Zelda as much or possibly more than me
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i love zelda what can i say?
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: What do you mean? O_o
<oni_link> I can say that Im in awe lol
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i have my triforce blanket around me :>
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, just trying to guess what you meant by watching a not-football game.
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: I'm calling it not-football because it's American football. :P
<oni_link> thats awesome >.<
<oni_link> My blankets are all plain
<Java> evening gentlemen :p
<oni_link> heyo Java
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im not a gentleman
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, oh. Okay.
<Java> heyo
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: So as nobody confuses it with the rest of the world's football, which my country calls "soccer" for some reason.

<oni_link> Yes please do XD
<Gold_Demona> Java: Yes that game.
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu i've decide the best term is West Atlantic rugby.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> zelda blanket link plushie zelda shirts
<Java> I lost
<aniderp|bestcakeever> zelda games

<Sumica> 00,10rawr
<Sumica> 00,10much engi farming
*oni_link raises his arms
<Kandarihu> Sumica, what game?
<Sumica> 00,10planet side 2
<Sumica> 00,10wrek was playing Imadoor try and open me
<Phase4> 00,02you have to love a game where 50 man teams hold out a base
<Phase4> 00,02actually there was probably a lot more than 50
<Phase4> 00,02if you count all the ground and air troops
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it was crazy
<oni_link> I can't wait to play this with you guys
<Kandarihu> Hahaha.
*Kipkat07_Scarf ponders playing FTL
<Sumica> 00,10but I was hideing out behind wrek keeping him alive
<Phase4> 00,02everythings far too expencive though
<Sumica> 00,10engi is a MAX's best friend
<oni_link> the in game stuff?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I almost had an anyuerism last time I played FTL... hmmm....
<Sumica> 00,10just work slowly at it phase
<oni_link> I bet, then again that the whole point of F2P :/
<Phase4> 00,02i'm sure its cheap to buy certs (or whatever you buy) but still
<Sumica> 00,10but notice how good the bonuse was cause we were a full squad
<Phase4> 00,02it feels like they're trying to cheat money out of me by putting a price on all the good stuff
<Sumica> 00,10and roughly 150exp is one cert
<Sumica> 00,10what class do you like most Phase4?
<oni_link> You guys wanna run the factions by me real quick? I kinda forgot em
<Sumica> 00,10NC TR and VS
<oni_link> which do you all play?
<Phase4> 00,02and the multiple character feature is mostly pointless, you need far too many certs to get anywhere and its a linear gain regardless of your rank :/
<Sumica> 00,10New Congolmerate, Terren republic and Vanu Soventry
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, engi so far
<Sumica> 00,10we ar NC
<Kandarihu> I found this thread on the FTL Game Hub on Steam where someone will gift a copy of FTL to anyone who writes out a good short story. What I didn't read is that the guy already called it quits with the givaway. So I wrote something out, and his next reply is him wanting to find a better way of conveying that THE GIVEAWAY IS OVER.
<Phase4> 00,02i suck at aiming though so non combat classes are best for me
<Sumica> 00,10well the aiming is shit for most NC guns
<Phase4> 00,02though i usually end up shooting a bunch of stuff anyway
<Sumica> 00,10they kick like a mule
<oni_link> even with a steady hand?
<oni_link> and burst
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah but i'll miss with the spread at point blank
<Sumica> 00,10with engi guns you want to cert in to forward grip and Compensater if you use the sights
<Phase4> 00,02my mousepad with that games mouse sensetivity, i'm that bad
<Sumica> 00,10if you want to shoot from the hip use the laser dot on the rail
<Rocket> i cant even fly ._. every attempt end as crash
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02that too
<oni_link> this game is so detailed o,o
<Sumica> 00,10aye flying takes a certen kind of player
<Phase4> 00,02mouse to roll is absurd and whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot
<Rocket> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02plus whichever the red guys are seem to have much better hardware
<oni_link> would you say its harder than Battlefield aerial controls?
<Phase4> 00,02never played battlefield
<Sumica> 00,10I can fly a lib and gal ok but a reaver(esf) is a no go
<Rocket> bf has way better flying control
<Phase4> 00,02i could probably pilot a gal if only because its slower
<Phase4> 00,02more time to compensate for silly controls
<Sumica> 00,10be got a few rocket podders in squad that are slick with esf's
<oni_link> This game looks like its gonna eat up all my time haha
<oni_link> its just massive
<Phase4> 00,02it is absurdly large
<Sumica> 00,10you should see what I do with a Gal phase
<oni_link> But thats good, I wanted something to breathe new life into FPS titles like this
<MadSurge> So does every hexagon have a control tower or what?
<Sumica> 00,10I can make them do loops and shit
<Sumica> 00,10not every hex
<oni_link> *just like this
<Sumica> 00,10some bases controll upwards of 10 hexes
<MadSurge> Aaah
<oni_link> this is what MAG wanted to be haha
<Phase4> 00,02theres still a lot of bases
<oni_link> and could not accomplish
<Moira> what game are you even talking about
<Rocket> Moira planet side 2
<Moira> PS2?
<Phase4> 00,02and each base may have several smaller bases around it that you can capture to spawn vehicles
<Sumica> 00,10you cant advance your controll with out a connecting hex or god levels of patances
<Phase4> 00,02anyway, reboot time
<Sumica> 00,10larger bases have upwards of 4 points to control as well as outlien depos that you dont have to own to capture but are helpfull
<Sumica> 00,10such as span points and tank termnals
<oni_link> Like a secondary capture point basically?
<Wrek> 05back with lunch
<XAX> What's for lunch, Wrek?
<Wrek> 05a simble hamburger
<Sumica> 00,10back in beta the side points were part of the base but it was a bit much
<XAX> awye
<Sumica> 00,10as a troop could capture the 4 outside bases and take over with out ever entering the center compound
<oni_link> It seems like a more balanced game now cause of it. You risk going for a smaller point, you get and edge for succeeding
<Mutterguy> goodnight everyone
<oni_link> *an
<oni_link> night Mutterguy
<Sumica> 00,10side bases often have a port in to the mane base
<Rocket> oh Wrek i have question for you, cause i have new tablet and its great, but when i try to join paintchat to try it out, i cant recivelog D:
<oni_link> oh so they become connected as well?
<Wrek> 05i know nothign about the paintchat
<Sumica> 00,10often a good tatic is to have the "zerg" go for the main base and smaller squads such as ours will hit the side bases to cut the enemy off
<Sumica> 00,10ask Phase4 about the painchat
<Rocket> okay c:
<oni_link> This game is impressing me so much and I haven't even touched it yet
<Rocket> dat music :D

<jcelios> Universe works on EST
<Zacklego> Everybody should be in the streets and play friday
<Zamer> well the Calender ended in June
<Zamer> since Leap Years didn't exist then
<Saturn> 08,01hoepfully15
<Serenity> The old calender was 10 months and 30 days in a year
<chrysalis> actually
<chrysalis> the world runs on UTC
<chrysalis> so we got another 6/5 hours
<jcelios> The Multiverse runs on Unix time
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: but that doesn't make sense, because a day and a year are of fixed length
<flutterfan99> hi guys i am in the middle of a blizzerd right now
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<chrysalis> Saturn actually... they arnt
<flutterfan99> oh what is this!?
<Serenity> Saturn: This was before astrology was refound
<IshPonyPonyPony> HaI EVERYPONY
<chrysalis> they add leap seconds which adjusts the length of a day
<Serenity> Like 1000 years ago
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> flutterfan99: Are you in north murica?
<chrysalis> and leap days to adjust a year
<Saturn> 08,01chrysalis: astronomically speaking, i mean
<flutterfan99> yes i'm in MURICA!
<Serenity> We're mostly British here
<Zamer> i think the actual date was June 6th or something close to that
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> Yeah. Been watching that blizzard
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> Its crazy
<chrysalis> again, we are slowing down
<IshPonyPonyPony> I need to point out a major error you guys made in the newsletter http://imgur.com/NJqRE
<chrysalis> so while its a predictable constant change
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> First day of winter is going to be crazy
<chrysalis> we are still changing the length of a day
<Saturn> 08,01though actually, there are two lengths of a day: a synodic day and a sidereal day
<Bronysith> Barbetos|FinalDAY: not only is it the start of winter, but also a full moon
<YokusaHHart> ded
<flutterfan99> so the world "ends" tomarow
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> Well that explains the bulges... in my pants.
<Serenity> Sunrise wasn't until quarter past 8 in England
<Dark92Enigma> AND A NEW ONE....wil rise
<Saturn> 08,01the former refers to the day wrt. the sun, and the latter to the day wrt. the stars
<Dark92Enigma> will*
<Serenity> And sundown was at 3
<Bronysith> Barbetos|FinalDAY: want me to relieve you of that?
<Zamer> but yea, everyone drop your stuff at my house i have a bunker that will protect it
<IshPonyPonyPony> http://imgur.com/NJqRE are you guys streaming on Christmas or not?
<flutterfan99> ok what is this!?
<Zamer> only room to fit one person though
<Barbetos|FinalDAY> End of the world? I will take what I can get.
<Saturn> 08,01a synodic day is 1/365.25 less than a sidereal day
<Saturn> 08,01iirc
*Dark92Enigma sees Saturn, brings the oatmeal pool, and invites him to join him
<Kandarihu> 15 minutes until the big sale begins!
*Bronysith joins Dark92Enigma
<Serenity> For the leap year thing
<Kandarihu> Dangit, I totally meant to wait half a minute for that.
<Zamer> big sale?
<Serenity> Why not just make seconds last a little longer?
<Kandarihu> Okay, NOW it's 15 minutes

<Zamer> https://www.humblebundle.com/
<Uboa-San> Is it the end of the Stream?
<Saturn> 08,01i put on my sunglasses and said "i don't celebrate christmas"
<Saturn> 08,01then rode out of the shop on a motorbike
<chrysalis> Saturn i dont like to either
<chrysalis> but apparently
<chrysalis> people who dont celebrate other peopls holidays are the bad guys
<Zamer> ^
<Serenity> Christmas has gotten WAY to commercial
<Snow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i74ZY24UHrw or those who like gmod
<chrysalis> Serenity you mean every holiday has either gotten too commercial
<chrysalis> or is purly commercial since inception
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'm not a christian, so i don't celebrate christmas
<Saturn> 08,01it's simple as that
<Serenity> I'm athiest
<Zamer> but Saturn if you don't celebrate Christmas you don't get presents from Satan
<Saturn> 08,01of course, i can get away with it better because i'm brown
<Saturn> 08,01so people naturally assume i'm a muslim or soemthing
<Zamer> i mean Santa
<chrysalis> whoah.....
<Saturn> 08,01and don't want to offend my culture
<flutterfan99> so why do the british get boxing day and merica get nuthing?
<Saturn> 08,01Zamer: it's pronounced "Saturn"
<Saturn> 08,01flutterfan99: we like a good fair fight
<chrysalis> flutterfan99 because we are british
<chrysalis> and we clean up after ourselves
<chrysalis> we dont make a mess and leave it for everyone else to deal with
<thegt90> hey where can i find that xmas luna pic
<Saturn> 08,01zamer: i discourage people from getting me christmas presents
<flutterfan99> you don't clean you teeth! (please don't ban me)
<Zamer> I know the feeling all too well
<Snow> ill brb guys, gonna play some LoL
*Saturn 08,01has no idea where this stereotype of british people having bad teeth comes from
<flutterfan99> i do't ether
<Zamer> my mom even threw an ultimatium tell her something or get a giftcard to gamestop
<Saturn> 08,01most of us have better teeth than you fuckers :P

<Bronysith> Lucarious: *you're....sorry

<Kandarihu> flutterfan99, that fact isn't very fun, though. But yeah
<Serenity> chrysalis: This castle...Is in, UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION...UNACEPTABLE!

<Flumori> hi Gekoncze
<Gekoncze> hi Flumori

<Buytoast> that's all you need to know
<flutterfan99> i got to the start of the first dongen
<Uboa-San> Skill Kid you Mean.

*Bronysith sacrifices BladedWings to molestia
<Zamer> https://www.humblebundle.com/
<Uboa-San> Hi BladedWings!
<flutterfan99> hi bladedwings
<Gekoncze> that's good
<Alchemist> or maybe the earth will be flooded with kittens and everyone will have a fluffeh and adorable death. Yeah, drowning in kittens :)
<Bronysith> or
<Zamer> or the Apocalypse Ponies come
<Bronysith> Evangelion style
<Uboa-San> Or ponies.
<Bronysith> EVANGELION ENDING
<Bronysith> thats how the world will end
<flutterfan99> maby it will rain cats and dogs!?
<BladedWings> Bronysith: why sacrifice me?
<Uboa-San> Or will it Rain Ponies?
<Bronysith> BladedWings: cause molestia will reward me
<flutterfan99> the world will end when mlp gets canned
<BladedWings> Ah, well in that case sac away
<Gekoncze> don't you know if there is meth sometimes after I go sleep?
<Uboa-San> MLP Will get canned in the Apocalypse after it's Done
<Gekoncze> I have seen him here only once
<Alchemist> flutterfan99: nah, we'll still have littlest pet shop
<flutterfan99> and pound pupies
<Alchemist> and the cast will still be alive so we can always follow them around
<Buytoast> my small horses is p[robably already canned
<Alchemist> not literally of course
<Bronysith> one thing bronies need to get in their heads is this
<Bronysith> the show isnt greatly written
<Bronysith> get over it
<Alchemist> I think we will have one more season at least
<Flumori> yeah he is online when your offline
<flutterfan99> but...but...
<Buytoast> B-B-BUT IT'S THE GREATEST SHOW EVER
<Buytoast> Y-Y-YOU'RE JUST A H-HATER!
<Bronysith> lol
<flutterfan99> in all serisniss it's the best cartoon i have eer seen
<Bronysith> meh
<Buytoast> what a sad life you've lived
<Alchemist> I dunno, I think the new eps are on par with the earlier ones.
<Zamer> Apocalypse = Your worst fear coming true
<flutterfan99> i'm not joking
<Bronysith> animaniacs is much better than MLP
<Alchemist> Bronysith: or Samurai Jack
<Bronysith> and batman the animated series
<flutterfan99> i've never herd of it Bronysith
<Bronysith> flutterfan99: youve never heard?
<Bronysith> of
<Zamer> wait flutterfan99
<Bronysith> animaniacs?
<Zamer> you never heard of Animaniacs
<Bronysith> the greatest animated show ever?
<Buytoast> again
<Buytoast> what a sad life you've lived
<Bronysith> Buytoast: kill him
<Wrek> 05"yawn*
<Zamer> Bronysith this generation is full of sad sad little children
<Zamer> Wrek we need some Animaniacs pronto
<Zamer> the children needs education
<flutterfan99> i'm sorry what channel is it on i'll watch it
<Alchemist> Zamer: good thing the word will end then :)
<JRP2234> hmm wrek
<Zamer> flutterfan99 it's not on any channel
<Alchemist> world
<Zamer> it was a show from the 90's
<Bronysith> I mean, animaniacs isnt my favorite show, but it is probably the best animated show ever
<JRP2234> you like challeng in doom wrek
<jcelios> the Hub plays it
<Zamer> along with Pinky and the Brain, Freakazoid, Dexter, Johnny Bravo, Samurai Jack
<JRP2234> beat the game with only the fist and pistol wrek
<flutterfan99> ok i'm going to go rethik my life aperintly
<Zamer> only the movie jcelios
<Bronysith> JRP2234: hes beat it on the hardest difficulty with no strafing
<Alchemist> oh and Dexter's lab was awesome too, and the PPG :)
<Buytoast> using the pistol
<Buytoast> what a sad challenge you put before yourself
<Bronysith> want a real challenge? Beat ninja gaiden on master ninja difficulty while taking NO damage whatsoever
<Alchemist> using the pistol only, no strafe and get 100% kills/secret
*jcelios wants to see Wrek vidmaster Marathon games
<Bronysith> which again, is near impossible, taking no damage in any ninja gaiden game is already hard enough
<Bronysith> unless ninja gaiden 3, that one sucks
<jcelios> !!!!
<alexxm> is it even possible to not get hit in ninja gaiden
<jcelios> !!!!
<chrysalis> oooh marathon
*jcelios dies

<Wrek> 05feck
<jcelios> now its getting real XD
<Buytoast> now is he holding a grenade or does he just have big meaty hands?
<jcelios> weird cyborg iron knuckles
<flutterfan99> wow the power went out fora second
<Uboa-San> Lol. Rising Lava
<Ryunosuke> so it seems steam winter sale is live
<Ryunosuke> commence with the spending :)
<VenHur> Hi everypony...It's currently the Dawn Of The Second Day, and there's 48 Hours Remaining.
<Uboa-San> VenHur: Hi!
<Wrek> 05FUCk
<jcelios> ouch
*flutterfan99 claps for venhur's refrince
<Wrek> 05never managed to vid past chpater 2
<Bronysith> Wrek: are you rage quiting?
<VenHur> So this is a DOOM modification?
<jcelios> ^blasphamy
*Bronysith sets VenHur on glorious fire
<Eli> VenHur: don't get upset about being on fire... i thought the same thing
<VenHur> FIYAH! FIYAH! FIYAH! IMMUH OUN FIYAH!
<flutterfan99> i've never herd of this game so i don't know of it's a good stratgy but why are you using the glove insted of a gun?
<jcelios> its a challenge
<jcelios> fists only
<flutterfan99> ok
<Wrek> 05no health
<Wrek> 05no save
<VenHur> Well, it's a game played just like DOOM...or rather a modification of it.
<Wrek> 05onyl fists
<Wrek> 05and wrong
<Wrek> 05they play completly differently
<Alchemist> in some ways it reminds me of heretic
<VenHur> No health...No save points...Only your bare hands and wits...
<Uboa-San> Wrek: Whats your skill in this Game? (With Fists Only)
<VenHur> ...Welp, this game is hard.
<Eli> it's more like your bare feet, from the looks of it
<VenHur> Nah, it's really his knuckles.
<flutterfan99> eli: what?
<Eli> flutterfan99: he rarely uses his fist... he just runs
<flutterfan99> Eli oh ok
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "help my mission to get marijuana banned"
<Zamer> so what we playing
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> uhhh… maybe look at the law....
<Bronysith> welp my father just successfully become owner of a tavern
<Uboa-San> Marathon (Game)
<Eli> uhhh... nice health
<VenHur> You know, the last couple of E3s we had is just not...well...impressive...expect Pikmin 3 and Rayman Legends.
<Uboa-San> What. Did they suck?
<Wrek> 05problem with this level is
<Wrek> 05that its an extermination level
<Wrek> 05you cant really vid it
<Uboa-San> Wrek: Whats your Skill?
<Zamer> E3 has been a joke for years
<Wrek> 05skill?
<Wrek> 05its runnign on total-carnage ofc
<VenHur> Nah, not really, it just lost "it's charm". More simply, there's hardly any moments where people stands up and screams/cheers like if all hell breaks loose.
<Eli> getting shot. it's a good skill
<flutterfan99> the kinect has been a joke for years
<jcelios> IIRC marathon was the first FPS with duel weilding, secondary fire and a primative form of "jumping"
<Uboa-San> 2 Years.
<jcelios> etc.
<Zamer> don't forget Nintendo's naming skills
<VenHur> But damn, if Rareware ever comed back to Nintendo, that "all hell breaks loose" thing I mentioned would of comed true.
<VenHur> That, or a new F-Zero.
<flutterfan99> btw i fell bad for not knowing what animaniacs was
<Zamer> i would find it hard to see a new F-Zero game or a revival
<Uboa-San> What if Microsoft Closes down Rareware before Nintendo buys the company back?
<VenHur> ^Blaspehy!
<VenHur> *Blasphemy!
<alexxm> lies
<flutterfan99> VenHur that made me think of ygs
<Wrek> 05ill be hoenst
<Uboa-San> uded
<Wrek> 05i never thought id beat that last level
<Wrek> 05with all those troopers
<Uboa-San> Try One Hit Death mode.
<Uboa-San> lol lag
<Wrek> 05hm?
<Uboa-San> Is it just me or is the game Lagging out?
<Wrek> 05Uboa-San: whadda ya mean one hit death mode
<Uboa-San> Wrek: Where one Hit from an enemy kills you instantly
<flutterfan99> and were off air
<Wrek> 05there has never been such a thing
<Uboa-San> Wrek: the Stream. It's off Air.
<Bronysith> new conversation time, Fav disney animated movies?

<Wrek> 05its my internet deprin up
<Wrek> 05but as i said
<Wrek> 05there is no such mode
<Uboa-San> Lol.
<Uboa-San> Unless there is a mod for It
<Kencolt> If there was a mod for it, it probably would be Wrek. Oh, wait, wrong kind of mod.
<Uboa-San> It would be One hit Death Mode.
<jcelios> pretty sure there are points in the games where its impossible not to take a hit
<Wrek> 05ok think i fixed the derpage
<Uboa-San> Wrek Sessions?
<Squallken> good news everypony, i ve beaten the MLP Game

<Eli> Squallken: screw nightmare moon. I want Luna
<Eli> Squallken: well, Luna is in the Album
<Eli> but not in the store
<Dark_Horst> Eli: which game you guys talking about?

<flutterfan99> i meen the stram
<Eli> Dark_Horst: yeaps
<Squallken> unless there was a way to get everything at the speed of light
<Punkie_Pue> Im guessing the streamer is preparing content. flutterfan99
<Kencolt> This is Wrek, trying to start playing a game, so we can watch him either be totally aewsome or fail in ways we dare not comprehend.
<Eli> Dark92Enigma-: it's one of these funny little time-waster games. but it has ponies.
<jcelios> Squallken: taking away the Higgs Field should do it
<Dark_Horst> just saw a guy named fallenalikorn in planetside
<Dark_Horst> first non-outfit contact
<jcelios> though time would not pass for anything aka not exist
<Squallken> Higgs Field?
<jcelios> what gives things mass
<Squallken> oh
<jcelios> things with zero mass travel at c
<Snow> whos stremming?
<Kencolt> so... photons have zero mass?
<Snow> streaming*
<Punkie_Pue> Does anyone else experience lag when switching to full screen of ustream. I am troubleshooting issues with flash and ustream seems to be the only thing giving me problems.
<jcelios> Kencolt: yup
<Squallken> ill be bbl, got to slave away at gameloft game
<Dark_Horst> once read that photons are basically packets of lightwaves
<Squallken> nvm, warcraft 2 is on
<Snow> warcraft2
<Punkie_Pue> nice.
<Snow> ERMEGERD
<Uboa-San> ERMAHGERD.
<Uboa-San> WerCroft Worl?
<Snow> *has Warcraft3 frozen throne*
*Snow fangasm
<thelonepony|school> Snow: adorable ^w^
<Snow> whoever is streaming, you want warcraft 3 frozen throne cracked? and ready?
<Punkie_Pue> We have come a long way as far as graphics.
<jcelios> I demand warceaft II expansion!
<Uboa-San> The streamer is Wrek.
<MadSurge> I am back! :$
<Eli> Squallken: did you ever notice, when Derpy throws away her cover, the "eyes" stay on the box?
<Snow> Wrek: you want warcraft3 frozen throne?
<Squallken> @Eli No...no i have not
<Uboa-San> *Warcraft 3
<Eli> Squallken: I knew derpy's eyes are werid, but this...
<Squallken> strange
<Dark_Horst> hlaf screen?
<Uboa-San> The Half-Screen. Bow before It!
<Ryunosuke> hmmm
<Uboa-San> *h\alf
<Uboa-San> *half
<Ryunosuke> MLP: Friendship is abrideged
<Uboa-San> Now it full
<jcelios> dat Metzen sig
<Uboa-San> Wrek: Are you scared of Slender?
<Snow> i litterally got the file here ready
<Alchemist> oh mai god!
<Alchemist> WC2!
<Alchemist> dem nostalgia
<Uboa-San> Favourite Assassin's Creed Game? Mine's AC2
<Bronysith> AC2 is the same as AC1
<Kencolt> Snow: I'd be willing to bet he's already got it. Wrek seems to have almost every game ever, and if he doesn't, SB64 does.
<Uboa-San> Only with a Different story.
<Alchemist> my dad bought it in switzerland when he was on a businesstrip and we got it in german.
<Eli> Alchemist: never try to get any game in english over here... doesn't work
<Bronysith> AC2 is the same game as AC1, yet people bitch all about AC1
<Alchemist> Eli: even games that offer multi language installs by default?
<Eli> Alchemist: almost no game has it. and even then, it's like half of the game is english, the rest stays german
<MadSurge> Bronysith: no insane people shoving you around and less annoying beggars will do that
<Eli> Alchemist: sometimes the voices turn english, or part of the inventory
<Eli> Alchemist: it can be so freaking annoying
<Kencolt> Eli: Usually that's the fault of a second party localiser.
<Squallken> bll
<Squallken> bbl*
<Alchemist> Eli: and why is that? Are the swiss this over patriotic? :D
<Eli> Alchemist: ...I would love to say no, but that probably only counts for me. Yes. Yes we are overly patriotic.
<Alchemist> I lived in Basel for 3 years when I was a kid. I have no memories like this neither did my parents bring this up.
<Eli> Alchemist: but it's also the fault of the extremly paranoid capitalist sytem over here. they seem to try to keep all our money behind our own borders.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did I see Warcraft 2 earlier?
<Kencolt> ah, Switzerland... known to the rest of the world mostly for fondue, chocolate, banks, and a serious pack of bad-asses who keep the Pope breathing in bad situations-- the world's smallest and toughest standing army, the Swiss Guard.
<Eli> it's almost impossibly hard for me to ship stuff or simply get it from somewhere else (where it's only half the pirce)
<Uboa-San> *price
<Eli> Kencolt: don't get me started on the swiss army. the guard's ok, but most of them are frenchies
<Alchemist> Kencolt: and Top Secret Drum Corps http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVdnMAGIt8
<Kencolt> Eli: And the Guardss in the Vatican anyhow, I know...
<Kencolt> Eli: Then considering who they are guarding...
<Eli> Kencolt: eh... other than most of my country, (and family) I'm not religious
<Wrek> 05should be up and runnign in 10 mintues
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, I've always known Switzerland for their Hot Chocolate, mountains, clockwork, multi-purpose tools, tax sheltering, and NEVER getting involved in wars.
<Alchemist> my folks are only religious on paper. they dont really practice it.
<Kencolt> Eli: Neither am I-- not even Catholic. But that guy is also extremely important to the geopolitical stage, and IS the head of a nation.
<Eli> Alchemist: if you want to see more of a swiss sport, try "Fahnen schwingen"
<Kandarihu> I'm Christian, but I'm protestant, not catholic.
<Eli> Kencolt: he was certainly important, and JP II was a sympathethic guy, but now? i'm not so sure anymore
<Kencolt> He still is. Maybe not as much upfront-- Benedict does seem to take a less "in your face" role-- but still important.
<Uboa-San> Did BEN kill Wrek?
<Eli> Kencolt: dunno... last time i saw him doing anything important, he declared "Tim in Knogo" as a holy book or something...
<Eli> Kongo*
<Uboa-San> Okie-dokie-Lokie!
<Eli> Kencolt: and that book IS slightly racist
<Kandarihu> I heard that there was some prophecy that the Catholic church got that basically explains all the popes from then up to the one that will be in power when the Antichrist rises to power. And the current one is second to last, and he'll be short-lived.
<EggNog5000> Hey everypony! :)
<Uboa-San> EggNog5000: Hi!
<Barbetos|AtWork> BWWWAAAAAMMMM http://i.imgur.com/KgFwS.jpg
<Eli> Kandarihu: i don't think either Christ nor Antichrist will ever rise
<EggNog5000> enjoying my snow day
<Uboa-San> Wrek should of had the NoCD Crack.
<Kandarihu> Barbetos|AtWork, rofl
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You know looking back on the game, Megaman Battle Network 4 is really bad
<Snow> Dammit
<Uboa-San> Never played Battle network on GBA. Only Megaman games on GBA i played are the Megaman Zero Series.
<Snow> Uboa-San: you missed one good game then
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> After looking at an LP for 4 the quality for it is really bad, typos everywhere, logic failures
<Snow> battle network 4
<Uboa-San> *sarcasm.\
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Hell the game is glitched so badly at one point
<Serenity> Hey everypony, I'm back
<Uboa-San> I played ALL The Battle Network games.
<Serenity> And I can hear Wrek typing
<Uboa-San> And i didnt give a buck about StarForce.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wait... Tomorrow is the 21st? http://i.imgur.com/pGChc.gif
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> If you own a Blue moon version and dont own a regular GBA Woodman crashes the game
<Snow> i only got the pleasure of playing 4 5 and 6 greigar version
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The fuck
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I liked Starforce
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: let's laugh at the crazy survivalists :D
<Snow> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I played starforce dragon!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I was more interested in that than Network most of the time
<Snow> its awsome!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Leo
<Snow> i only need one more card
<Snow> and then game completed
<Uboa-San> Megaman Zero is A Sidescroller. Battle Network is an RPG. Know the Difference.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Last time I played Starforce 2 I cheesed the game
<Eli> since the four riders of apocalypse clearly have middle europe time on their watches (they wear Swatch), we have 4 more hours to live!
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://i.imgur.com/XKQkK.jpg

<Eli> if anyone can say for himself that he isn't going to die, he's a liar.
<MaxTheBrony> true eli
<MaxTheBrony> we all die some day
<Kencolt> The Mayan calendars does not predict the end of the world-- it suggests the end of a cycle. It suggests change. Not an apocalypse.
<thelonepony|school> Hi MaxTheBrony :)
<Evening> we're going 2 die.... but not tomorrow
<MaxTheBrony> Heya thelonepony|school :)
<Snow> i can predict your future
<thelonepony|school> MaxTheBrony: we have tod die sometime
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The evidence for the mayan doomsday is about as solid as soggy paper
<Shizuka> 13except they associated calendar rollovers with world shaking changes
<thelonepony|school> to*
<Snow> you are going to die, i just cant see when.
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Serenity> Kencolt: Are you in my science lesson? We had a freaking hour debating about the Mayans and their calender
<Eli> well, some people are going to die tomorrow. trampled to death by the screaming fanatics
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek links allowed?
<Serenity> Snow: I'm dying on my 53rd birthday, fortune teller says so
<thelonepony|school> MaxTheBrony: Is he streaming?
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah
<Evening> i cant c anything
<thelonepony|school> vecuase i dont have Bstate on right now

<Eli> i mean, come on... the end of the world was already around 1000, 2000, 6.6. 2006... srly, are they done yet?
<Evening> http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html
<Barbetos|AtWork> Velma is hot... Not gona lie...
<Barbetos|AtWork> She can solve my mystery any day.
<Gow3pro> Whats this song called ?
<Snow> THE AIR IS POISONOUS, IT ONLY TAKES AROUND 80 YEARS TO WORK xD
<caligulasAquarium> :S ...uh what now
<Serenity> That brings me to remember
<Serenity> Who's gonna watch the planet lineup tommorow?
<Eli> Snow: my best friend likes to say; "Life is a deadly sickness."
<caligulasAquarium> Ooh!!
<Evening> i dont think we can see it without a telescope
<thelonepony|school> thats tomorrow?
<Serenity> Yes
<Evening> yes
<thelonepony|school> shit, i'm not prepared D:
<Evening> it only happends a few thusand million years i think
<Serenity> thelonepony|school: All the reason this end of the world bullshit is because of the lineup
<thelonepony|school> Serenity: ikr
<Evening> not really
<Serenity> It marks the end of the Mayan callender
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonepony|school! :)
<Evening> Its linked with the Mayan calendar
<Shizuka> 13http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/maya there
<Serenity> A mayan year lasts 5200 years I think, don't quote me
<Evening> wich will begin a new long-count period on dec 22
<thelonepony|school> Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :3, i've been. Naaaauughty~
<Uboa-San> How do i shot Web
<Eli> You know what would be really funny? I think I would die laughing if that happened: The world ends for real tomorrow
<Swiftheart> the worlds not going to end
<Shizuka> 13sure it will
<Eli> shit that would be so funny
<MLP_Brovakiin> thelonepony|school: Okies, detention :3
<Shizuka> 13you are all in denial
<Shizuka> 13it is a simple fact of astrophysics that the world will end
<MadSurge> Shizuka: oh u
<Eli> come on guys. we all know the world ends around the year 5'000'000'000... don't you guys watch doctor who?
<Serenity> The world is going to end, just not tommorow
<Swiftheart> Yeah
<Serenity> *Sarcastic child voice* it endz todai
<Shizuka> 13it ends tonight
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Disregard doomsday, watch ponies
<Shizuka> 13I KNOW IT DOES, I'VE SEEN IT, THAT'S WHY THE REST OF ME IS JUST GOING TO ENJOY THE SHOW
<Eli> it totally ends 21.12.2012 - the eastern countries are already dead.
<Shizuka> 13also steam holiday sale is live, empty your wallets
<Evening> Sure thing bud, just dont forget 2 call yourself really fucking stupid on dec 22.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: 3 hours and a half until friday here! :D
<Snow> aparantly
<Serenity> Eli: Britain isn't dead
<Uboa-San> Sorry. I had to Refresh the IRC because everything froze.
<SirWrathy|Study> isnt it exiting? i mean we are all about to die! YAY
<Snow> i got 10 hours left
<Eli> Serenity: you have 4.5 more hours
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Fun fact
<Eli> i will dies in 3.5
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The mayans e\never included leap years
<Serenity> Eli: I survive everything
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So we should have been dead YEARS ago
<Swiftheart> Im going to have a marathon of pony episodes tonight :D
<Swiftheart> If the world ends then i'll die watching ponies.
<Eli> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: duh... it is also possible, that the church removed some years in our system
<Snow> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: you even know why we have them?
<Evening> Just as the calendar you have on your kitchen wall does not cease to exist after December 31, the Mayan calendar does not cease to exist on December 21, 2012.
<Swiftheart> Illl watch doctor who to
<Snow> the world doesnt go around the sun in EXACT a year
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So if the mayans did predict a doomsday would have ment we should have died years ago
<Snow> every 4 years
<Eli> Evening: my calender ceases to exist after 31.12
<Snow> the rest of the time that is left is exact 1 day
<Barbetos|AtWork> This will be the worst that happens tomorrow. Carry on. http://i.imgur.com/kHg7w.gif
<Eli> Evening: every year
<SirWrathy|Study> im going to hold my fluttershy plushie in my arms and watching ponies b4 the countdown ends, then i can say i died happy
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Evening> Q: What is the origin of the prediction that the world will end in 2012?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> not to mention WE HAVE NO CONCRETE EVEIDENCE THE WORLD WILL END
<Serenity> One thing puzzles me, I heard yellowstone was dorment, isn't it sceduled to erupt soon (I'm speaking like years)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> People just fucking assume!
<Evening> A: The story started with claims that Nibiru, a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians, is headed toward Earth. This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003, but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to December 2012 and linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 -- hence the predicted doomsday date of December 21, 2012.
<Eli> Evening: but my stove gets warm and cozy
<Serenity> Wrek: Don't get drunk, that's not the way to go
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Right if a planet is heading right for us, why havent we heard about it recently?
<Swiftheart> I should tell mom that I didn't clean my room. What's the use if the worlds gonna end xD
<MadSurge> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CONSPIRACIES :D
<Eli> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: governement conspiracies
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/wZ92K.jpg WE WILL REBUILD
<Kencolt> Hell, if a planet was even near us, the gravitational/tectonic effects would already be eveident-- and it would be VISIBLE.
<Evening> if mayan was correct we whold be dead years ago
<Serenity> Shizuka: NOOOOOOOOO
<Serenity> Kencolt: I've seen enough Armageddon to know where this is going
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> We've had SO MANY doomsday theroies and every one of them WAS BULLSHIT
<MadSurge> Shizuka: end of the world, but everyone becomes ponies :D
<Eli> Evening: chill down dude. no one believes the worlds gonna end. we're just havin fun
<Snow> Wrek is gonna play some tf2 it seems
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *theories
<Serenity> ValvE
<Shizuka> 13no this time the world's really going to end
<Shizuka> 13you know why?
<Snow> i saw it through my steam XD
<Shizuka> 13bieber is still playing music
<thelonepony|school> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: like y2k one, People wasted thousands of dollars (or whatever currency they have) :D
<Evening> yes becouse all ppl so stupid :3
<Serenity> Shizuka: Actually, you make an extremely valid point
<Evening> Beiber! i shulda known..
<Shizuka> 13AND
<MadSurge> Shizuka: OMG YOU'RE RIGHT D8

<Shizuka> 13RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
<thelonepony|school> D:
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Shizuka: Riiiiight
<Evening> oh we're playing TF2?
<Swiftheart> My soup told me it will be gone in several minutes.
<Evening> oh dos dat loud beep
<Shizuka> 13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the mayans predicted awful 21st century pop artists!
<Evening> god"
<caligulasAquarium> HAHAHAHAAA :D
<Serenity> Shizuka: So when they were saying "End of the world" They meant "End of the world for music"
<Kencolt> Who the heck is that?
<Shizuka> 13yes
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Maybe Twilight will be good for once
<Serenity> Well shit.
<Evening> Ah the guy streaming is swedish! :D
<Shizuka> 13and actually
<Evening> Hi swedish bro :)
<Shizuka> 13since i just finished setting up hikari
<Serenity> Evening: Didn't you know?
<Shizuka> 13it will be the end of my minecraft world
<Evening> nope i dident know he was swedish
<Serenity> Shizuka: Ran out of RAM?
<Shizuka> 13nah restarting
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I'll be here laughing my ass off at the idiots
<wipergone2> end of the world tomrrow
<Swiftheart> Slenderman will kill us
<Shizuka> 13hopefully i can convince minecraft to live under 1GB on hikari
<Evening> It will be the end of the world as we know it
<Evening> on channel 9
<Serenity> I can max Shitcraft with 2 gig of RAM
<Shizuka> 13wreeeeeeek <3
<wipergone2> Shizuka: :3
<Evening> go get them
<Shizuka> 13Serenity: see i tell it to use 1GB on asuka, but it manages to gleefully eat up 4GB
<Barbetos|AtWork> OHHAIMARK: http://i.imgur.com/CdIAl.gif
<Serenity> But I upgraded to 12 gig, so I can put it on ultimate PC raping
<Shizuka> 13hopefully on a dedicated server box it will learn to live within its means
<Snow> i got a weapons too much, you want any Wrek? it would be a waste if i had to scrap them.
<Serenity> Shizuka: Do you have a Server Computer?
<Serenity> I'd imagine you have, since you do a tonne of hosting
<Shizuka> 13just set up hikari yesterday, 4GB ram where it matters
<Shizuka> 13better than haruko rocking 256MB
<Serenity> 4 gig? Hmm, I'd expect something like 32 gig for a cheapo
<Shizuka> 13$15
<Serenity> I know super super expensive servers tend to have like 128-256 gig
<Shizuka> 13yeah i have no money at all
<Serenity> ^
<Shizuka> 13sorry 2GB ram, it can handle up to 4
<Serenity> Saving up money, gonna buy a Falcon Laptop
<Shizuka> 13but buying the ram to max it out would cost $70 so no go
<Shizuka> 13squeeze as much as i can get out of 2GB scavenged from other boxen
<MaxTheBrony> woah that shizuka pink is all over :D
<Serenity> While I remember about internet connection and such, anyone ever had BT all around? The deal that lets you connect anywhere with 3G?
<Serenity> my mum's been thinking of buying BT with 3G connection support
<thelonepony|school> Serenity: BT?
<Serenity> Yes, BT
<kidzrul732> oh my god! I just saw the hobbit!
<kidzrul732> that's right I went to the movies instead of going to school
<Serenity> Oh, just noticed all the pony models are ponies, like Eppaljack and Twelegt
<Shizuka> 13obvious spy was obvious
<Snow> exploding toghether
<Serenity> Wrek: Who're you in a call with?
<Snow> so much fun
<Serenity> Don't think I recognise the voice
<thelonepony|school> kidzrul732: you skip school, to go watch the Hoobit movie...
<JRP2234> 99 Luftballons

<Shizuka> 13awwwwww comparing points
<Shizuka> 13oooh a rager

<Snow> *cough*whogivesashitaboutpoints*cough*

<Invi> dat intermission music :D
<Invi> aw
<cachi01> hi everypony :)
<Invi> hi thar
<cachi01> who is ready for a giant goku crashing to earth tomorrow?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> heya cachi01
<Wrek> 05ready to take over in a minute Scoot-Scootaloo? :D
<alexxm> so what movies are on tonight
<Scoot-Scootaloo> yessir
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai cachi01 :)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Apperently Megaman Battle Network 4 essentally killed the franchise, shame. I sort of liked it
<cachi01> it was meh
<Wrek> 05live techno done right
<Wrek> 05too abd the vid doesnt feaute the actual live play
<Wrek> 05but beats bring ing an macbook
<Zamer> i always thought that Star Force killed it SpadeKyurem[WoW]
<Wrek> 05thats it for me for today
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Starforce was good,imo
<Wrek> 05gona make warcraft 2 work now
<Wrek> 05scoot will take over
<Wrek> 05this vid ends in less than a minute
<Wrek> 05enjoy :D
<Zamer> then as normal for our species we seem to disagree on the killer
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also you if you get the Woodman Scenario in Blue Moon you can't finish the game
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Guess why
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> For some god damn reason the game cant be coded properly on anything besides a regular GBA
<Zamer> umm i never had a problem with the woodman scenerio
<Zamer> and i played the game about 3 times
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> On what system?
<Zamer> GBA
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The game has some kind of loading error exiting a random battle when on a SP or DS
<Zamer> i have both
<Zamer> and played it on both
<Zamer> never seen it
<cachi01> i'll just leave this here........ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSmhZFbCy0
<Zamer> must have had a good copy then
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The most game breaking bug in 4 is if you link the Blue moon and red sun before fighting the 6 version navis the game becomes unplayable
<Zamer> well i remember that one but glitches doesn't kill a franchise
<Zamer> just the game itself
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Well the fact the quality to 4 was crap
<Zamer> Starforce was crap in both story and quality compared to the previous games
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not to me
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It played better than Network
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> At least Starforce didnt have bullshit minigame tedium just to get through the game
<cachi01> .................................
<Zamer> HI
<MadSurge> We're live!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Personally I dont see how Starforce was worse than Battle Network, Network had SO MUCH BACKTRACKING
<Zamer> wait i thought this was MLG
<MadSurge> :O
<Bronysith> who is this streaming?
<MadSurge> PERRYDOTTO <3
<cachi01> brb eating
<GabeMoist> what is dis?
<MadSurge> :D
<Zamer> thing is though without the backtracking gameplay became so linear and the battle system for SF had little to know strategy
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Back tracking is not how you lengthen a game
<aniderp|bestcakeever> omg..
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It gets boring, fast
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i could join that game
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but i need to look the pass up :\
<MadSurge> :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ok, who's the clown constantly extending the time?
