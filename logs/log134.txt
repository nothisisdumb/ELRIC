TBH on its own, its only a 2 star ep. if the conclusion is good, It can hit probably 4star, but not 5star status.
Fuck yeah.

I think that The CMC's fighting caused Discord's return
next week
Cool and unusual punishment
anyone else?
stil same......
Thanks for repeating it!
Yess.

My guess is that Ep. 2 airs next week, as it is a weekly show.
lol
the opening is the exact same?
And yeah, wait a week.
I still want to see + hear luna's voice
that was just amazing
thats a bit gay

It's sad that I knew this room would be the least crowded
Dat: The show already played first episode, this is an immediate rerun.

not shattering*

Bendyrulz: No colors, please.
AHH

I read a comic where they broke them
Great villian

I have to agree that making sense is kinda boring.
0seems legit
He's awesome!
@Cranberry. I know... MORE Luna!

Part 2, Y U NO COME FASTER?!
*In Applebloom voice* I WANT IT NOW!!!!!!!!
I really liked this ep, but I kinda wish they saved the story for a movie
hah
GRAPES
lol
Right?
I'm okay with this
Whoo! season 2!!!!
DONT CALL ME THINGS I DONT KNOW THE MEANING OF
we devoted

The hub endorses baby prostitution.
FUCK
applejack lost it in a bet, and rainbow dash lost them both in a bit
No, I have never seen babies like this, and I don't want to EVER AGAIN
Felt rushed
I CANNOT SEE.
*bet
0man, this episode was worth staying up all night for it
Definitely worthy of villian status.
I can't believe she's actually been mentioned OUTSIDE of the first episode!!!
its lagging a lot. my computer fails
"I hate losing"
you would think a statue of everything you stand against would be in a safer place
There's only one episode of Season two though :P
Or maybe during the whole seasone?
Also, this is actually live.
yes part two is next week
BIITBOOOX

Fluttershy: No, not really
oh ok

Celestia looks kinda pissed
more like distroll amirite?
But there's more than just her as exec producer

DashOrCrash: I want to believe
Did Celestia just knight Twilight?
lol
>MFW THE LABYRINTH IS PLAYSET
Can't imagine the second episode living up to this one
HEYO
I think fluttershy was right, they should have just went home

DashOrCrash: I actually think it's very likely
She's just like "Nope"
/me PONY RANGERS, MOVE OUT!
haha
TITLE DROP
yeah that gif would be hilarious, him doing a moonwalk on her head
0Derp
Not willing to help
Again?
spolier=she looses her wings
twilight: its in the laberingh
My little ponies...
Trollesta have been overthrown
poof
he's the same voice actor
nope.avi
Twist and turns? OMG, it's Twist's fault!
is he really completely evil?
lmfao
Time to have fun ^_^
derp
Yeah
Hedgemaze =/= labrynith
naked dash
NO MORE WINGBONERS
spolier=they loose their horns
I hope they put in some kind of easily escapable Arkham equivalent
Epic win
She totally deserves that kind of thing
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
You gauise
yep
rule 1 never cheat a hedge maze
DOOD
No
Now where's the pony called turns?
yes
is it the same voice actor for realz? thought i recocognized it
refresh time
Everyone becomes a filthy earth pony!
Hee twilight is adorable there
Twilight is cute when she's desperate
Slow much?
DOPEY...DONT U MEAN DERPY
Yes yes
She can't necessarily do anything else.
Applejack is the best ever in this case
It's him
DHBSHBFF
Then everyone was earth pony
And it was
lol
Are female knights also called "sir"?
XD I like how Twilight had a more girly reaction than Rarity had! XD
kayne
haha eeeepic
when did the brodcast start
Maybe he'll think they're just that fun and fix everything then pop in every now and again for giggles.
great evil laugh :3
twilight went in a panic like pinkie when she thought there were bats on her face...
MAI WINGS
hah
YO HORN MA HORN
Aww crap, no horn
dunno
LOL
it wasn't the moon walk it was the running man
far less than half is gone
lol
i think would react the same way as twilight and rarity if lost my horn
=P
No, they're called lady
BAAAAAATS
bad touch
Douchecord.
get yo booty into D&P
BATS ON MY FACE
shouldnt twilight and rarity have each other's reactions?
female knights are "dame"
ARE there female knights?
If he wanted to do anything villain-y, there'd be no way to stop him
i was expecting something like luna, like vengeful
there was around 7-8 hundred
Awwwwwww sheeee
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
Most skilled
No magic? but he can use it?
Rarity rears, while Twilight looks like there was mice on the floor or something! XD
yeahh
like "dame" judy dench
now there's 624
thats not fair...
Well yeah, half is an exaggeration
