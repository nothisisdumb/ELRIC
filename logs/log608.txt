Okay.

checkovs grate
Is it safe to assume that the intermissions are being placed at the half way point of each movie
dat drain
i smell huge fighting scene...
the problem with turtling in a castle is food. In the medieval ages, it was a tactic to starve the enemy out.
idiot
have no fear. there is plenty of movie left to go
gunpowder!!
Stupid design.
^
:O gunpowder
Wormtongue, you dumbass.
yeah 10's of thousands
The unholy hand grenade

>must have entered the tower
Und dann they had tens of thousands.

Naked snake survived that
bye
Conbustiblelemons Only because it was a cutscene
that was arwen
Well that's one way to wake up.
Hoers.
best. pony. EVER.
dat horse
Hero horse revives man!
recovery positions
"I saw that woman kiss you and I wanted one too!"
Aw!
Good Pony *what was his name?*
now kiss
Bill the pony
Aragorns pony is best pony and kisses like Arwen
Is best pony
not actually a pony
it's a horse
its an AMAZING horse.
Pony: "GET THE FUCK UP, no time to be sleepin' boy."
Close enough.jpg
Agent Smith grew his hair out
would have been awfully embarasing if it took him to edoras
05,15why are we whispering?
That horse just can't feel like a horse without about 150-200 pounds on his back.
that would beprettyfunny
There is always hope
and then he beat her.
...
How old is Arwen?
Arwen is probably several hundred/thousnad years old
I heard Agent Smith there made a lot of money that year. Being in the matrix and LoTR..
as are pretty much all elves
ooops
Samwise: Because it's night, and walls in Rivendell are paper-thin
that is wrong
sorry
I AM OFF TO WATCH PONIES
arwen is pretty young
she is about 25
:'(
that is when all elves
arwen is 3500 years old
:'(
>_>
take their path to immortality
it's The Two Towers
considering he is 3000 years old, 25 is pretty much straight out of the womb isnt it?
05,15Sexy Cry
just saying
05,15ONLY ONE TEAR ALLOWED
Uh. No she won't? I thought it was made clear that elves could give up their immortality. Can't she just....ya know, do that after he dies?
She is 3500 years old? That cradle snatcher!
*Sexy Cry Time*
:(
Going after a poor young 87 year old
Arwen gave up her shot at immortality
not 25 250
2 TEARS
my eyes*
about
That's aroud 27 in elf years.
Those wheren't ninja's.
lol
XD
:P
NAILED IT!
and off the elves go to the undying lands
....
NOOOOOOOO
let the sex jokes begin
DONT DO IT
Elrond stays to watch the war
This music reminds of Night Elves from WoW
XD
Unless you kill them first, then there are elf years!
wait, if arwen is 3500, that would mean that elrond is at least 4000, possibly as old as .... OVER 9000
The elves are rage quitting middle earth!
Hope you've seen his reading of 50 shades of grey. it's hilarous XD
damn french people
in LotR
They probably barely realise time passes
Well the elves had a lot of grief in middle earth
They must be fed up with Saurons hax
In a stunning twist of fate, it turns out that the Undying Lands were actually Antartica. That's why there are no elves left.
ded
it was epic.
:'( nooo frodo is going to die
or is he
Everyone dies.
and he's the protagonist
why are men always the dicks in fantasy?
yup
TOOTHLESS
yes
:P
there really isn't such a thing as 'half elf' though.
elf is more a status then a race
he has the voice of an angel
50 shades of grey = twilight porno fanfic
fine I'll look it up
brb
Could you guys stream that? That'd be hilarious!
05,15Twilight porno fanfic that was published and out sold Harry Potter
