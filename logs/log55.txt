!stafftodo del 2
Removed ToDo item number 2: 03Turn TST's main site into a meme site...
Hmmm, TF2
12:>
I downloaded that the other day but hasn't played it yet
oh yeah
have you done the divs as well?
12No actually, that's low priority at the moment since the profiles have to be redesigned a bit
12Different stylesheet,.
ah
well, shouldn't be that hard
12It'll be fine ^^
12It's just different names I guess
12Unfortunately I have lost a couple of things with the upgrade like profile visitors, but hopefully Lugia can correct that..
6I bbl
6I have a doctor's appointment
6and then I can finally start working on PLUSH
6woot
<~Articuno> Unfortunately I have lost a couple of things with the upgrade like profile visitors, but hopefully Lugia can correct that..
Profile Visitors 4.1 works with SMF 2 iirc
12It doesn't seem to LOL
12Or at least, not with the new UP
you need to edit one or two things
one sec
12I have
night
well, there's some broken code or something
and I have forgotten where the mods are lol
nvm, find it
not where?
and what version of UP are you using?
12The package manager cannot find the lines needed to add the mods in
Ah
12and 0.9.1
12the latest..
same one, try using PV 4.0
4.1 was broken
yeah, 4.1 is broken
12wtf
12Why? LOL
12Aww crap
12http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1150
no idea
12Now I remember why I couldn't do this
eh?
/me checks for original package
I can give you my files
I know they work because they work
12it's ok, I found 4.0
ah right yeah, the PV mod was deleted
took me ages to find it
12lol
124.0 does not work for SMF 2...
try it
12Basically none of the lines it tries to find are there
o_O
that's not nice
12and there are a LOT of entries it needs to add
4.1 doesn't work on SMF 1.1.x
which file is it having issues with?
12Which? 4.1? Profile.php (but I just found the line, it's very slightly different)
I'll check 4.0
which line is it?
12Themes/default/Profile.template.php
12Ot
ah
12It's fine, that one is done now
12Profile.template is the only other file
12but I'm just looking into that again
6Hai!
Ah right
heya Skylands
10hiya
well, I don't have a SMF 2 forum installed anywhere currently, only SMF 1.1.x, so I can't really help sorry @ Articuno
14Hai~
14How are you? :3
12No worries, it's VERY different in some places -v-
I need to sleep now anyway, so good luck etc.

06Garbage has souls too.
14owait we need CF :X
Lol
yeah, Heracross is like the only good bug type XD
6Hadn't said that in a while :P
GINGERS HAVE- nope
02But but
02Pinsir :<
14Nah
Ew no
scyther.png
6I spoke to her a week or two ago..
/me runs
14XD
02No way
14^
Scyther is cool
14^
14Scizor too
14:O
I guess
14she's alive!
Scizor isn't pure bug
02Scyther is nice, but I don't much care for it, looks to flimsy
6Yep ^^
02Pinsir and Heracross are beasts
I know right
set a scyther on fire
problem solved
Masquerain is cool, just dont use it to battle lol
Wow, Abbey is still around.
14xD
ew cutesy ones
:P Hey.
Oh my God.
It's RDX.
02too*
14Hi Dari :3
He' back!
14I hardly use bug types
same
bug type is so pointless
14I like Scolipede, but that didn't last long for battling
6I still find it pretty amusing that the one of us has her birthday a week later than the other.. :P
poison is worse lol
EW 5TH GEN
and eh
Plus, its a pain in the butt to catch surskit lol
Scolipede though, thatthing is a beast
I wish it got a better moveset
poison is so obnoxious
14YES
6And FTW I'm finally going to learn guitar! :D
14EXACTLY
which makes I good
14ikr
*it
14yay :D
6Heh :P
the type is only decent 'cause of toxic
but lol
14Also, I love my Seviper
yep
'cause any pokemon can learn it
14low defense OTL
02I loved my Scolipede, was pretty darn effective against the Elite 4
02But...
toxic is amazing
02After that it became my weakest Pokemon and I had to find a new one
14moveset = not good
Seviper is awesome
14lol my guitar has just collected dust for a while xD
14heckyes
k.
/me 6is happy to have finally become friends with someone from school that she has stuff in common with..
Same with arbok
02And then I found Larvesta <3
6Mine gets that too.. :P
Larvesta is adorable imo
02Yes
14I'm thinking about getting an arbok and breeding it with my seviper
But god, evolving that thing
14so I get more moves
I hate 'adorable' Pokémon
14pain
02It takes forever, but I've already done it lol
14PAIN
GOOD FOR LOOKING AT, NOTHING ELSE
Better off catching it later
14Volcarona is awesome D:
/me prods Shiny
I know
06I don't like bug types in general :<
Rayquaza or GTFO
/me not type-biased.
/me pokes back
6Meh..Only problem is that it'll probably be a little confusing since this guy is right=handed and I'm left-handed..
I agree with espeon, save for a couple
6*-
02I like Shroomish and Breloom
we've gone over this
02I know they're not bugs
02But <3
sunkern > rayquaza
Bug and poison are my least favorite types
14My types of choice always happen to electric and dark types
Ponyta is clearly best pokemon. :P
NO.
02Did you need something May, or were you just prodding me? XD
/me prods Shiny
14nah
14oh that probably wont be too much of a problem
14I'm just poking your floofiness
Cattle prod?
06D:
02We're all forgetting one very important Pokemon
14no :<
02Dunsparce
14lol it doesn't evolve
6Yeah,but just maybe a slight confuzzle,nothing big..
14xD
Evvolving it by st anne, instant profit
02I did too
14it has awesome IVs
What about the one with wonder guard (I think that's what it is)?
dunsparce is the best legendary.
02And I named it James
14the hand positions might be the only trouble
02Even though it was a girl
Lol
14otherwise everything else should be fine
6Yeah
Dunsparce lol
yeah, Shedinja
/me doesn't get it |D
is epic
What were they thinking?
I like it kinda, but seriously
same thing they were thinking when they designed 5th gen?
as in: they weren't
Oi
06Shedinja is interesting
06and using it against the CPU is nothing but gambling lol
yep
6A little question..What exactly does depravity mean? >.<
I love Shedinja though
14I NEED TO FINISH MY PROJECT FSKJFSALDKAJ
As I was saying, I don't know if they were making it to be novelty only, or potentially making an evo for it later
06"derp I have ice beam here but I'll use TACKLE instead"
I wonder, can shedinja learn um
Endeavor?
06LOL
srsly
Oh god lol
06I doubt it
can it?
:/
06but it would be hilarious
would be epic
I dont think it can
endeavor + quick attack
Oh great...
if it could
14it's like wicked
That would be instant win
yep
6What? o.o
6:O Ok,thx
14or without morals
MOST EPIC POKÉMON EVER
6:O
"He's" here...
/me missed something
06shallow movepool is shallow.
*POKéMON
/me shot
remind me to hack endeavor onto a Shedinja
and LOL
Yeah that's why I never really used shedinja
6Which of the three he's?
14He?
RDX...
06I think it's about just as shallow as Flareon's movepool
14Shedinja is just scary
14oh
06;-;
14That's all
I liked having delcatty on my team, assist was fun
lol flareon
flareon makes me sad.
^
6Meh..I just needed to know..The guy suggested it as our band name and I didn't really know wtf it meant.. xP
14xD
wtf is the point of assist
It should have had flare blitz
02Done and done
but evolve it or gtfo
/me 6just got reminded of a Sparx quote thingie
02Lol no
well
14:O Which one?
at a cerftain point
Assist is just a random attack, but I always had awesome luck with it lol
6Which come to think of it doesn't make too much sence.. o.o
14I'm working on my Absol right now
level 30 something
14I haven't played in awhile though
well
6"You..? Does that mean him?"
Absols are love
I like when wild pokemon use Assist.
14Absol is legit
break is over
02Usually that's what I do for my Nidorino
brb
6From ANB :P
02cya
14LOL
Should I re-download DotD?
:S
absol is my favorite pokemon.
14go ahead
:(
14wait, whut?
>implying it's bad that RDX is here
14Download?
6If you want to..
Metronome is so fun
06Absols are fun.
02Bet you can't guess what my favorite is!
02<3
uh uh uh
whismur?
14I was raising a Togepi in Silver
:O
14Metronome -> Aeroblast
LOL, I used the infinite cheat, and it still gave me the achievement.
14Amazing
CLEFAIRY USED JUDGMENT. WHA.
02I like Loudred, just training Whismur to get to Loudred is annoying lmao
What
6Emulator ftw or download and burn ftw?
/me 14is reminded that my brother still has my ps3
Unbeatable
6D:
I've always gotten the most craptastic moves out of metronome
14Loudred
TOGEPI USED SPLASH LOL
Swellows are fun to train
02^
/me 6got a sudden want to listen to the I Suck at Call of Duty song.
02Swellows are
14Oh yeah. The Xbox version has achievements right?
14Yes Swellows
swellow is a badass and knows it
But I love swampert
I was invincible, Malefor was not.
06Speedeon
I hate marshstomp though
lololololol
I hate that whole line lol
and not just 'cause of the memes
6I've done that one too.. :P
Yes.
02I have one in my Ruby for Nuzlocke, and he just races above everyone else with his attack power, speed, and easy leveling
One of my favorite eeveeons
14:|
02I named him Crepe because I was hungry when playing
"Lipton Green Tea w/ Citrus"
/me 14is disappointed that the PS3 DotD had no trophies
6Ok,I really wanna listen to I Suck at CoD.. brb.. ._.
HOW COULD YOU?
14lol
:P
14lol
I love mudkips
14mudkips
I hate mudkips~
Oliver lol
wish they'd die in a hole, etc
02Mudkips are powerhouses, I can get through the whole game with basically only that Pokemon's line
14BECAUSE SPEED IS OUT THERE
6Hooray for half limping.
So I herd u like Mudkipz.
02Treecko's line seems to be the hardest out there to train.
02And beat the gyms >.>
14same too
14:X
14I miss my Flash in SoulSilver
treecko's the most badass of the starters that gen though :(
14but I don't want to transfer is to Black
Took out my friend's sp def lugia in one hit
:O
grovyle takes bases and owns them.
06o.o
14Heckno, Blaziken
02I still like Sceptile lmao
14I want one on my team
02I like all of them
Derp derp.
14BLAZIKEN
Eeveeons is fun to say
blaziken is reasonably badass
02But Treecko is a gecko, I love geckos
06Yes
Better than eeveelutions
but I prefer the grass dude
That's just weird xD
06eeveeons it just rolls off the tounge
6This song really suits me atm.. ._.
MFW I know nearly all the names.
02Blaziken was my first Pokemon in Saphire(when I started playing the 3rd gen)
It does don't it
!alerts 54650
54650: No Alerts
14Fffff I wish I could connect to PDW and get myself some starters

02Don't ask me, I'd rather it be .com, but it's .org lmao
Not considered an evolution
06The word Eeveeon is now burned into my mind.
14How is a game an organization lol

14No, the fact that there's a Pidgey make me want to claw the person who made it for ripping me apart from everything else
6Oh god..I need to walk again.
14And the fact that I love Poochyena and Shinx

6Indeed..
14o.o

The white one controls the sun in MLP.
And the dark one is her sister.

CoD4 released just before trophies did I think.
14yeah
Or just after, but the game was already finished.

6You can't kill the metal..The metal will live on...
there was an announcement.
Like SR said, MLP has the most fan art out of any fandom pretty much.
14I'm sure of that
And all of it pretty much is clean, the main place bronies go is ponychan and R34 is banned there.
14wow
14so no rule 34 of MLP?
14._. Impossible
Probably not no, because it's R34. :P But not much I'd expect.
/me 6wants to get more A7x videoclips onto her PS3 :3

LMAO
that is exactly the card!
Soo..... who here has money.
12from even more cards
12to shirts
everyone has money
well i didn't know about it
you were not even trying were you
12best part was you didn't even need a deck
what about an understanding of the game
do i need that
12i fight for my Feathers is now playing TF2
6not if you're going to hang out
6lol
12no Zoroark
the kind of rare card is what drf guessed
Kasumi no Namida
12it helps but you could get a free pokemon shirt for just registering for the event and it didn't matter if you showed up or not XD
12might get a little peeved but what are they going to do?
02brb
That's good, because now you can use it to DONATE TO MY POCKY FUNDS!
See: http://powerplant.comlu.com/

12Zoroark, nationals was held at the indianapolis concenvention center
Facebook chat became so much better when I integrated it with irssi.
Aurora, what were you talking about?
now it's actually usable and accessible through a decent piece of software.
!May
12because i know you are too smart to fall for it anyway
14!
14~
14wow
14HA THAT WAS A FAIL
good luck viewing pictures in irssi though
/me flees
I figured
12lol
but yes I am too smart to fall for that one
oh, you meant facebook *chat*
facebook itself is all about pictures
that's what I said.
oh
> Facebook chat became so much better
I missed the word chat
sorry
Oh wow.
also, Twitter in irssi.
The other mods are going to love this.
14Icy.
hmm?
14Don't be alarmed. But I think you may have a minor case of serious brain damage.
Lawl.
I might be looking into a portable HD Radio
even if it is FM only
to that I say UGH
..HD FM radio?
the digital system we have in the US
technically known as IBOC DAB
ah.
meaning In Band On Channel Digital Audio Broadcasting
*jumps*
We use DAB /or/ some other thing
depends on the country.
here it's dab.
I know of that one
also known as Eureka 147
not a bad system
the FCC considered it but we are out of spectrum that can be allocated
14xD
I find analogue radio interesting
because Eureka DAB requires a separate band
but I've no equipment nor any knowledge/experience.
14Say apple.
FM here in Indianapolis SUCKS big time
digital radio, I'm more meh about. Lacks the amateur appeal :p
*jums*
*JUMPS
the list goes on and on
for listening, I just use fm because I've no digital tuner.
plus HOW MANY COUNTRY STATIONS DOES ONE FREAKING CITY NEED
14No, what you did there was jumping. Can you say aaaple?
and they all play the same stuff too
rofl
u mad?
whatever is in the top 30 in the charts
nope
just annoyed
/me strangles self for the meme
so as a result I have my own FM transmitter
to play my own selection of music
*jumps again*
its on 107.3 FM and also runs RDS!
14Okay, close enough.
14Gosh I love wheatley xD
Arti should scream less. Yes, I'm looking at you, Articuno.
I wish you could space core in charge
14LOL
14he would send the facility to space
14SPACE! SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
very nice to have since I have a portable receiver that supports RDS on FM
And all would be well with the world
14I want Rick in charge :D
a Sangean ATS-909 AM/FM/LW/SW receiver
14he was funny
14pervy, but funny
its fully within the rules specified by the FCC
mhm.
RDS fits within said rules
Careful he has a black belt... in bed ;3
lol wut
for FM your maximum bandwidth is 200 KHz
6Back
14I heard that xD
My dad and a friend used two radios as 'walkie talkies' while driving around in Europe
one in each car, with the antennas mounted on the outsides.
12OMG >V<
well within the legal limits for bandwidth
12YOU CAN HEAR ME??
I think the radio is still in our basement somewhere.
12I'm upstairs D: and Xai was tickling me!!!!!
14Yeah. I have a black belt in everything. Larate, Karate, Jiu Jitsu, Taekwondo, belt making, kick boxing.....bedroom.
Articuno: only rarely :p
that is to say, only when you scream the most.
12Did you hear me just now? ovO
alright, I have to get my rear end back to work
I'd like to see that ;)
I heard you when I wrote that, not after.

03o.o
/me runs
Would you say EWWWWWWW DIRECTV if I said I had DirecTV back in WA?
03yep.
ok
screw this chat
03I hate InDirecTV
i'm leaving
03I mean get this
What service do you have?
03I was watching TV at a restaurant
Really
03they had one of those news reports on
03with the 'live' time
03it was over a minute behind the actual time
nah u think
03that's some serious satellite lag
03>_>
u ppl are of no help
03and I have WideOpenWest, a very small cable service in my area of the country
You liek?
It doesnt say come to this chat to get help on whatever your doing
03no usage limits, and you get everything TV-related for free
03none of that tier BS
f u
03you either have it or you don't
03well, besides HBO and whatnot.
Nah
03and yeah, I love WideOpenWest, they're one of few non-evil ISPs left :/
way to be nice
and help someone
We had *braces for EWWWWWW DIRECTV* DirecTV and *braces for something that he himself agrees is ew* Qwest
I dont know what your talking about! What jellyfish area, what relic? I dont know! And you got mad, so your not nice
WB U
DirecTV was pretty reliable for us, but Qwest was blah
legend of spyro eternal night
Oh U ;3
wb Skyland =D
:)
10Thanks Patrick
03I actually don't know anything about Qwest
I have not played that one, im sorry im so useless
Good
03since that's a different part of the country
Customer service is bad enough
03I just hate those nation-wide cable companies
oi vey
03like Comcast
internet service is blah
03that and DirecTV/Dish
i wish i could shoot this dog my mom is dogsitting
03as they rip you off too
Comcast was pretty popular back there
but I didn't like it
03my main problem with satellite is that you have to buy a separate Internet company
/me ywans
/me yawns too
unlike you, I personally liked DTV
03whereas we have our Internet/TV/phone all for one service
spyro sucks
he's so lame
03well, at least with cable, you can use your computer as a giant DVR
03you can't do that with satellite :p
03have fun filling it up and having to delete recordings
The activision spyro yes
no the legend spyro
he sucks
Well, we had shows that were mostly 'Record now, watch later, delete when done'
...thats what i ment
goddamn
i was so close
03well
03I like to archive things
Fantastico
noooo
finally i got ir
*it
god
03I have like 5TB now of TV recordings
If I archived every Top Gear episode I ever watched, I'd need a huge hard drive
03I'd love to see a DVR with even a 5th of that :P
sorry i was rude to u suinide
wow
03LOL, I'm not talking about Top Gear
03I mean like, movies
14LOL activision

Aww
03EW AT&T U-VERSE
03I used to like the idea of it
03but
yeah not fun
03I talked to one of their sales reps
What is that
XD
03they said that when you watch TV, your Internet slows down since it's TV-over-IP
03which is just STUPID
*makes out with Suinide*
14So what about a relic?
03you know what AT&T is? It's their attempt to have home cableh service o.o
03-h
*mms*
03All Trash & Trash
i got it
it was a health relic
14Oh, Okay.
14Did you get both?
yea but it took forever
14aw
huhuhgvjkujkm
Meh, there could be a better T in there somewhere...
and i died cause spyro is dumb
Trash &.....
Terribleness?
03LOL
All Trash & Terribleness
03LOL this Judge Judy case is completely silly
14I felt like that sometimes :/
and Verizon required me to add a little weird antenna
03Verizon has always had good 3G service :P
14Got irritating seeing him dramatically die like 50 times
so I got Trash & Terribleness, which actually wasn't too bad in my home county
yea
no kidding
and in NYC
and Seattle
03dunno, I've never had service problems with Verizon
the part of the county I lived in had sketchy service, but AT&T surprised me a little bit
rawr
I used an AT&T app that helped report service problems, and they actually had better service after making a few reports
Vodafone here is crap
sometimes 3G, sometimes o
Mmhmm
3G = good, o = blah :\
perhaps it's just Italy
Were getting kpn 3G for my tablet
*cums*
???? wtf?
How's your service, lighty?
I havent got the card yet
ok
You know what your rawrs do to me...
03wtf is o
mmhmmmmmm
how do i get the item behind the burned ship before arborick?
o = no internet xD
03that's called 1X
03or CDMA
03with AT&T it would be GSM<
It shows up as o
03not for me
next to Vodafone is either 3G or o
o = veeeeerrrrrryyyyy slow internet
nvm
'ello, Minnet.
'Ello, Lakorv.
03here you either have 3G or you don't
14oh
14x.x
14I was about to say
here, you'll either have 3G, o, or the very rare No Service
yay i'm at the boss
arborick
o? o.O
oi
mostly when going through tunnels
I'm honestly not sure what o is
I'd have to post a screenshot of it with Vodafone o
14Good luck :3
so far so good

I like the service plan I get with Vodafone, though
he's at now
03sigh, EW FALSE ADVERTISING
03this ad keeps saying that viruses can cause "permanent damage to your computer"
03nothing is permanent, just wipe the hard drive and start over
03>_>
19 Euros per month for 3GB of data
03EW DATA USAGE LIMITS
a little more expensive than with AT&T, but more usage
permanent damage to the contents, though.
yup
03screw the contents, if it's important enough you should have backups.
03and whose fault 9is that
03-9
unless you're the average computer user
> fix'd
14kay ima log off nao
true
14cya people :3
beat him
03now, I lost some pretty important data, because I had an external hard drive that I dropped which physically broke x.x
juidrtxgfhj
I still don't have backups
03but that had nothing to do with viruses
we've been meaning to set up a server for ages
03we?
but my dad is as slow as me with doing anything.
03oh
I have a backup, but it's probably disorganized
either a plain backup drive, or a raid'ed storage server.
I have a 500 GB Toshiba Canvio portable backup hard drive
it's good enough for all the contents of my PC
Minnet: what's the time in England - that's.. UTC+1?
Lakorv: The time is currently 21:34:19+1, Thu 2011-07-21.

i'm dreading ravage rider
it is currently 10:34 PM here in Italy
Minnet: what's the time +0200?
Lakorv: The time is currently 22:35:16+0200, Thu 2011-07-21.
tha's Italy (and most of Western Europe).
Nope
Italy is the same as the netherlands
...
yes
03LOL Mythbusters, they forgot to blur the Toyota name off the back of this pickup truck they're using in this episode
exactly.
Thats +1
lighty: look again
Minnet said 22:35
no
that's 10:35 PM.
Summertime and wintertime
This is timezone +1 not +2
Italy has summertime, yes?
Yup
and it's pretty freakin' hot @_@
then it's +0200.
because UTC is.. well, why don't you ask her?
Minnet: what's the time UTC?
Lakorv: The time is currently 20:37:13UTC, Thu 2011-07-21.
Toyota
add a space in there, but you get the idea.
The timezone remains the same
we have a Highlander
it good :3
lighty: urr.. no?
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/write_for_help_illiteracy_7470.jpg lolol
/me random
But the time changes
CET is +0100
CEST is +0200
UTC is UTC, always.
GMT is +0000
Utc is always 0
BST is +0100.
lol
Italy is currently observing daylight saving time, which means their zone is CEST -> +0200.
Hm.....
Timezone is still +1...... but the time is +2......
...
/me likes this talk about Italy :D
i take that back
they -change- timezones during summer
he was easy
CET is always +0100
but during summer, Italy enters CEST.
luna
as do most of Western Europe.
including Norway, where I live, and where the time is the exact same.
.hm.......
Then i think i made a lkttle mistake... XD

anyone know how to beat the executioner?

I don't know why I even try to be calm with punks like you SR, I really don't know why I would want to be your friend either, if I actually lived next to you I would either A) Murder you B) Explain my reason to the very best of my ability . . .
03they were trying to get a car's drive shaft to drag on the ground so it pole vaults
03and they kept missing the pothole

03*them
Aha XD
I remember that one
Good old times
wow
and they failed with the going fast enough by a speed camera one, too
they shouldn't have gone to Sanoma's dragstrip; anybody would know that a dragstrip at a roadcourse isn't the best testing environment xD

hi Staeld
goddammit, Ocean
What happen?

07No
Pattyrick: 23:10:13 . warning SSL read error: Connessione interrotta dal corrispondente
07Haha
in Italian even, because I've my computer set to Italian.
lol
I've been meaning to learn the language :>
07I dunno, I think I'm in need of some support today.. I've been feeling alright for the most part, emotionally, but now as I'm on my own, some thoughts are surfacing.
07Bothersome ones.
and re: my message
07LOL!
xD
07Bwar
/me rolls and dies.
Pattyricks certainly need sleep
07I want this connection to be stable.
07yay!
:D
Now she'll be around for the next meet
07XD
07I was ill this meet you know..
07Spent most of the second day in Newcastle resting
07as if I got up, or walked too fast, I'd be hit by bouts of nausea.
07also Staeld
07sure the connection can hold?
07o.o
not sure at all
07lool...
that's why I'm trying :>
07well..
07Sorry I'm not really too talkative
07I don't know what to say
07Often I'll find it very difficult to confide in you, mostly because I don't know the words in which to say things
07And it just seems... closer somehow, in my own language also..
07So there's that z.z
07it's mostly just an issue regarding wording
07not so much trust. o3o
07and just denial in general lol
19mins-10secs...
Woah, I feel dizzy.
shh
07Vertigo?

14hey drf
03hi
14would there be a script that make mIRC look a certain way?
03depends
03what sort of look do you want?
14for instance, colors
03you want to replace certain colors with other colors?
14like the background being black
03yep
03you don't need a script
14and then everything else all colorful
settings.
03alt+k
03or View - colors.
14no but, I mean
14since the default color is black, I want it to make a rainbow |D
Can you please do that for me drf?
03uh
03maybe later
14so it goes red>orange>yellow>green>blue>purple>red again
03and May, I'm confused
oh yeah, desktop
03yeah no I don't know how to do that
ok
14nevermind, I'll try to google a picture or something
03but as for making the background black
03just hit alt+k
03and change it
03I changed yellow to orange so I'm no longer blinded xD
/me is disappointed cause I didn't win a Xbox 360 in a claw machine.

i like how that link takes me to the 404 page
yeah
03lol"..."
it's what it's called when you take a whole website and just go through the html and extract what you want.
03ah
instead of using a specialised api for getting only what you want from the source.
03there's also the !google script that doesn't work
the problem is that the script is now looking for some html that Google no longer uses.
03yeah
thus, it doesn't find the defs.
03it's broken some other scripts too
03I mean, not my scripts, but other bots I've seen.
it's the problem with scraping.
that's why apis exist.
find this line:
my $lines = join ' ', $content =~ /(?<=<li>)(.+?)(?=<br>|<li>)/is;
replace it with
my $lines = join ' ', $content =~ /(?<=<div class=s><div>)(.+?)(?=&nbsp;)/is;
it will be buggy for some lookups, but it might just work for at least /some/.
06:3
03alright, let me try it
03and what about the color stripping?
hm
I don't really know how irssi scripts handle input, so I'd have to look around in the script for where it passes..

no matter, we'll be starting shortly
For a moment, I thought nothing was going on.
7Yeah, except it's my router, DRF.
7Or else why would the rest of the internet stop functioning?
7Connection is still laggy. D:
02Hiya Feather and Quan
7Hey, Shiny.
/me 7stops trying to connect to DW at the same time.
03LOL
03that's probably why
03Flash is a bandwidth hog
where do you have that from? o.O
7o.O
7On my DS, DRF.
I never saw Flash hog my bandwith.
03it's made by Adobe
03>defective by design
memory and cpu, sure, but bandwith? o.O;
03oh
03well dream World in particular, rather, is a bandwidth hog
03as it refuses to run if I'm downloading a file in the background
03despite basically just being a farm of minigames
also, when you get an Adobe product on the DS I'll be impressed.
03not sure why, but the backend is kinda dumb, one of my friends basically decompiled the entire thing and wrote a script to hack it and get whatever you want XD
Hm, flash doesn't cause me problems.
03Flash has crashed my browser on several occasions
Lol fail.
03like if Firefox freezes at all, 9 times out of 10 it'll be a tab that has Flash running.
I've got at least 30 tabs open, most of which have .swfs embedded on them.
4There's peoples here
03inb4 ponies
Mainly ponies, yeah.
03I'm not saying Flash ALWAYS crashes, but when Firefox does, it's generally Flash's fault
03as it actually SAYS "Adobe Flash plugin has crashed" etc XD
Lol. XD
7Disable the plugin?
7Hmm, wait:
With chrome it gives you the option to terminate flash.
03LOL
03so does Firefox
lies <.< >.>
03but it still lags the browser after you do so
03and I generally just restart it anyway
Wow.
Not on chrome.
7Do you mean the one that actually allows you to execute Flash?
7Or an add-on?
03yes
03there's only one "Adobe Flash plugin" for Firefox.
03unless you have some odd third party one I've never come across
7Odd.
03and it's not my computer either, I have a quad core i7 yadda yadda
there are?
Lol, yeah, I wouldn't blame your computer, it's probably a hell of a lot better than mine.
I thought we were all spambots
03well some people hate me bashing Adobe
03and go all "It's probably your computer that sucks"
03so I'm just dispelling that theory.
03not dispell, whatever the word is

03the only thing I don't like about this laptop
03is that the battery only lasts like a little over an hour
03since it's basically a desktop that's portable
7Hrm...
Hm. That's not very long.
7Maaaaaaaaay?
03well
Hey! BILLY MAYS HERE with another FABULOUS offer!
03I have a 6 cell battery
03using a 9 cell I get almost 2 hours out of it
03it just extends out of the back of the comptuer and makes it annoying to carry around
4Billy Mays is dead
Ah.
03and mfw some computers now have *12* cell batteries
I know, and it still hurts inside :(
4And now I' sad
4*I'm
4THANKS VAL
I suppose it doesn't matter if you normally have it plugged in anyway.
03I have one of each, the 6 cell that fits flush with the back and a 9 cell I'll use if I'm traveling and can't plug it in
4YOU JERK :(
03exactly
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
03it's plugged in right now.
I DISGLACE MAI FAMIRY!
*stab*
03I'm going to take my laptop to class, though, where it'll be on battery power
4Indeed

MFW I don't know who Billy Mays is.
O_o
a salesman
Milly Bays.
He was like, the greatest actor ever
as far as I know
Home Improvement?
I heard he was a shuffleboard champion.
I DON'T THINK SO TIM.
he basically was in every commercial that ever advertised anything
HI BILLY MAYS HERE TO INTRODUCE ORANGE GLOW
ARE YOU ON THE BALL?
GET ON THE BALL?
hold on a sec, guys
8YOU DONT KNOW BILLY MAYS?
I'm fixing some audio issues
he was one of the MANY celebrities that died recently
EeeeeeeeNOPE
03anyway, bbl, class.
03will be on laptop
8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb2bMdH1iPY
twas a sad day for us all
>Salesman
>Celebrity
Wut
>he died
and he brought us the magic of Chipotle'Away
well he was an actor
LITERATURE REFERENCE
and he just took LOTS of roles on commercials
so that was sort of his "thing"
What are you doing, hipster? That video's too quiet.
..he was on the laptop.
7DRF needs to change that location-whachamacallit.
the hostmask?
8DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT BILLY MAYS
I don't know, its use of colour is beautiful. Black black and more black, plus a meaningless phrase about the broadcast being offline.
:|
7Since he's not a moderator any more. XD
7Yes?
So very... well, hipster.
also why's he not?
7Long story short, the community is fed up.
So.
so has everypony heard about the whole facebook thing?
pardon my frankness, but.. that took a while.
It's happened for awhile now.
Nothing new.
You mean brony content being declared spam?
ah
7From what DRF's done before, you mean?
...we really ARE all spambots. MINDFUCK
just heard it myself
well, spam I didn't hear
We are secretly missionaries.
but apparently a lot of brony accounts are getting deleted
mains included
What if the spambots are the actual humans?
What do you mean "secretly"?
let's just say I was surprised he was still a mod three days after I joined.
@Elky "WHAT A TWEEEEST"
7Hmm.
I'm not a tst member, so I've kept out of any disputes.
@Valthejean: WHAT A THWEETH!
7Okay.
7Okay.
now also a friend of Arti and Lugia, and an acquaintance of some others.
I'm on the net here and chat willingly, but don't parttake in the metastuff like organisational disputes.
7All right, cool. :)
o-o
Altair
ITS NS! :D
/me np. «Who The FK Is Alice» - Smokie
yeah I figured
I missed him yesterday too
and heya
I ctrl+f'd "facebook" on EQD and only found that "every single character so far" poster.
IT'S A GEM. Has everypony seen it yet?
24 years, just waiting for a chance.. To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance.. Now I gotta get used to not living next door - to Alice.. (Alice? Who the FK is Alice?) o/`
the comic-con poster?
I saved that image
yes, it's great
IT DOAWS NAUGHT HAVE ENOUF CARAMEL!
I DEMAND THE ERROR BE RECTIFIED!
still, I wanna know who's in that balloon.
I find the unsencored version is more common than this one - maybe not so much of a surprise.
Planning on using it as my desktop background
/me huggles NS :3
well noy now
I'm still kicking myself repeatedly
Ah, I love that song!
Caramel. Caramel /is/ in the picture: in the balloon
I LIVE in San Diego, and this is the FIRST year I didn't plan to go to Comic Con
what surprised me more is that he was on three days on a row
Aaaaw, sorry to hear that Val. It always works out like that
Though I never knew of the uncensored one
of *course* the year I decide to not go, something I'd actually WANT appears
stupid Twilighters killing Comic-Con for me....
Geeze Val, you lucky sun of a gun.
wow
@Snatched oh well, what can ya do?
lol
lol, "somewhat" lucky, I still wont be getting a poster :P
Buy one on ebay for hundreds of dollars
haha
yeah....anypony have $1000 I could borrow? :P
mfw I would be surprised if there are.
oh I'm sure there are /b/tards who will get the poster just so they can post a vid of them burning it
tbqh the attitude towards drf's demotion is starting to annoy the heck out of me
and thus the War of Love and Tolerance begins!
ValtheJean: I do. Just transfer over $9,000 into a specified overseas account.
7Whose, exactly?
lol
06yawn
you wouldn't happen to be a Prince would you? :P
oh man
7Hey, Espy.
/me gets popcorn
not sleeping yet, Espeon ?
/me steals some from Zoroark
9sorry guys
9my comp froze
nu
9had to restart
>:
s'all good bro
This Prince forgives you.
Understandable
what, I mean.. borrow! Borrows some.
So what's on for tonight? Policenauts?
Or was that last night?
Welcome back my good sir.
I think it was KF and L4D if I remember
9no, Policenauts will start on Monday
06Nope.
The "community" is not fed up, only some people lol
Anyway I'll shut up
>Killing Floor and L4D
Hot shit.
06Either you read between the lines or it was like
don't worry about it lol
06many hours late xD
06but k
hes fun XD
9I was thinking of starting Policenauts yesterday
and some SoC
9but decided against it for a simple reason
lol, I'm *STILL* a member of the L4D2 boycott, and have still never played it
xD
well, I only just got on lol
9but Val, the reasons for making a sequel were understandable
/me glomps
9plus they still release DLC for L4D1
06:3
Also, frying pan.
9Valve didn't go uberdick
What simple reason would that be?
9UNLIKE CAPCOM
/me hugs
FEATHER
I preordered that game for $50, and they released a new game a year later
argh lag lol
10XD
But that's Gabe Newell.
But they probably won't make a L4D3
did we ever get the source development kit like they promised?
9yeah we did
I thought it was always out, Val.
o rly?
9or at least L4D Authoring tools
The movie maker is on the pipeline though.
9you should get L4D2 now
not before L4D2 it wasn't
9I got both games for like 7.50 in the Steam Sale
9plus they keep releasing Free DLC
I've already got L4D2. Haven't gotten any friends playing with though.
I'd have to play 1 again and see if the changes are worthwhile
9if a company should be Boycotted
9that'd be Capcom
lol
have you SEEN the rediculousness of the new DMC game?
9that's nothing
9compared to their other assorted bullshit
true
9dude there are CAPCOM HATE GENERALS in /v/ right now
9yes
9Capcom's bullshit is so amazing
That's really bad.
9//v/ is talking about VIDYA GEIMS for a change
4Calling Mr. DCD, you have a server waiting for you
I still lawl at all of those RE5 controversies
9I'm going live
kill some zombays for us :PP
:P*
So why no Policenauts?
Grab a few shots.
9and we're live
Did you ever unlock the Steampunk Foster?
9and desertman: that'll be Monday, because Policenauts is longer than Snatcher
yay
9and I don't want to leave you n a week-long cliffhanger
Yep.
nope
Sounds good.,
ME.
can't hear ya <.< >.>
ME
me
Wtf.
I don't hear anything
8VOICECEPTION
4SO MANY VOICES
or was that ni?
it needs to go deeper
We need to hear deeper
OMIGOSL OMIGOSH OMIGOSH
Why are people saying me?
8http://inception.davepedu.com/
OH GOD DCD IS TURNING INSIDE OUT
I love that button
I hate and love it when that happens
almost as much as the "NOOOOOO" button
4BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
oh, forgot to use the volume adjustment wheel
I have this game. Will I be able to play with? : )
Okay BRRRRRRRRRRRR
What was that?

Dessur, we should play with them : P
BRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRB
8EBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBR
4Well, if DCD shows my server
That'll teach them to have superior economic strategies!
4Then you guys will most likely be able to see my server
Ghosties, show it >_<
>implying you aren't
ohai Feather and NS
10hi
4Oh, DCD, I changed my character
/me curls up on Feather's head
oh, I'm late it seems
also hi :p
I have L4D also : D

Hi soarin
4I figure we won't survive the Patty, but I'm doing this for the next level of my perk

But dual monitor means (+windowed mode) I could watch and play : D
I am joining like a bwas

I'd watch, games are like, rally hard...
Apperently there's another free weekend now

DCD, why is your voice so quiet?
oh ok, um, i'll give it a try?
DOIT dman

pointing it out != attacking
Ghosties, i'll do everything you say :P
06that was uncalled for Quan

7Ahem.

I just never wanted to add you as a friend
7At times. :3

That would make 6 if RagingAstray joins
because you're annoying as fuck :3c
06When you least expect it.
Hahaha NewDCD
awwwww
Lol.
7(My character would probably be a Pyro, lulz. Fire-type. :P)
10I wish I could play Spy
10he's so hard D:
4Who all is joining?
so, server name is Ghosties, and it's got a password
I'm a dick
lol
remember?
I want to play with you, but I don't want to be your friend...
:3c
7In actuality, I stay away from playing him. XD
Just got pass from Steam
it's okay, we still <3 you :P
7But I do have a butterfly pen in real life. :P
10I need to practice as other characters though
BUT I WANT MAH MONAYZ
My comp can't handle anything
10I want to be more than just Scout and Medic D:
ok, derpy isn't the pass
bro
BRO
BRO
somehow my game is derping
DesSur said on steam 'derpy' is pass
SRSLY
I only see ghosties on the list
I GOT CATHERINE SPECIAL EDITION
7Wait 'til the community game. Or not.
I already spent a fortune on WoW! I cannot buy more games lest I bankrupt myself!
and whatever I write doesn't show on the stream
ALSO I'M FROM ENGLAND (maybe some voicechat stereotypes will occur : D )
YOU THINK I HAVE MONEY FOR ANYTHING ELSE?
brb game restart
Over my head, mate. Woosh.
I GOT UM... NOTHING RECENTLY!
7Speaking of, I need to get the news on its date to the other people who've said they can join. D:
Requesting pass.
yes
THAT VERY LIMITED EDITION
:P
4Actually, Killing Floor is $19.99 normally
Ghosties, NewDCD, what's the password, DesSur and I are stuck at it
the one that was produced in VERY LIMITED EDITIONS
4I got it during the Summer Sale for $5
dude

If it's ok to know it
4Dman, PM
06Even though I play the most Demoman he's as far from my personality as one can get, lol

06and Feather, try the dead ringer. Also called "Second chance ringer"

OMG! DAAREN JUST CAME ONLINE AND HE'S PLAYING KILLING FLOOR! THANKS STEAM!
10I can't figure out how that thing works
ikr
what a dick
shut the fuck up faggot 8|
mfw my name is Katherine
Close enough I gues
DELISHOUS SUCCUBUS
NO U!
4Steam is pretty neat actually
Also guys
7Right click.
I'm moving the TF2 server when I get home tonight
Now i get to see how delayed the stream is to my game lol : D
Steam is Amazing
DELISHOUS. SUCCUBUS.
I've used xfire more than steam. XD
Never really used steam.
06you pull it out, you leave a fake death and ragdoll with killfeed / kill log message and everything but you stay alive and cloak instantly. The worse your enemy the better it is.
Because the expiry date for the server is drawing close
4I've spent more time on Steam in the past month than I have on my 360
You should stream it yourself and then only play using the stream.
I don't even play online games, and I think steam is nifty. Even without the sales.
A week ago a friend said 'what's steam' and I said 'do you agme on ur pc' and he went 'yea' me: 'Wat'
anyway, I'll be lurking elsewhere, going to poof for a while
also bro
7Okay.
kk
SUPAH ROBOTTO TAISEN OGS @

At first, I got steam only to play some demos

4When I see them in the stream, then I'll get the game going
SUPER ROBOT WARS BRO :3c
4OH

>inb4 dat plot
Excellen's PLOT
how comes livestream is still there?

LATOONI'S PLOT BRO
SHINE'S PLOT
IBIS.
ghosties im ingame round 2 rite now what's happening here?
7And as a Spy, ALWAYS expect a Pyro.
IBIS plot.
4DCD, are they in the player list?
inb4 nonexistant
06and that's why tf2 is balanced I guess
spy + friendly fire must be a fun combo.
06LOL
7Lulz.
4Other than daaren and you...
06tf2 is obviously not built for friendly fire but
Zengar has more plot.
06it's hilarious at times
7I'd make a standard reference right about now.
06if it for some reason is on
7Yep.
7Especially if you can get the entire channel to have a Heavy picnic or go all Spy. :P
4Dman, did you join the Ghosties server?
7Etc, etc.
Dio Brando's plot.
:3c
Dude

03Haha
sudo apt-get install figlet

etc.
03I Just knew the site I had bookmarked was called figlet generator or something
03but that's nice to know xD
yeah

Can I put it on a floppy disk?
:P
03why would you use a floppy disk to store anything
Because I can
:)
03I mean, i have a floppy drive for vintage software but I wouldn't ever actually write to one anymore
I'd say he said " "

03so she said I can go ask people myself
03so far not a single person I have asked has said they wanted me demoted :P
how many people so far?
03more than the 7 sue suppoesdly had.

03not that i'm racist against southerners
lol o.o
03but I mean come on, this is just hilarious
speaking of racism
03I mean
when I went on my band tour
Nope
03Can you picture him teaching a class?
XD
03Hold on
we performed at a high school
and some of the idiots there were all like "go back to japan"
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zG-w3XwgEE
03now, I'm not turning my sound on because I'm in class, but I think that should do?
LOL
Yes

/me still belongs to Skylands for 5 more minutes

03I mean'
03I'd juts be sitting there laughing my butt off the entire time
nope
Lol
03Exactly
03so I'm not being racist, it's just something about this guy's accent that makes me go LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLWHATAREYOUSAYING
Xeli I'm serious
and that was to a girl who looked nowhere near asian or japanese for that matter
Austrians are blind
Erm
03LOL
Australians
:P
and one of the guys started banging around on our percussion instruments, and one of the conductors chased him off and we told him not to touch the stuff
6austrians lol
03or someone else?
03as you totally look Asian :P
and he was like "This is my school so I can do whatever I want, so I can steal something from you too"
and it wasn't to me
03ah
and apparently he went and searched our instrument cases later before our conductor raged at him
03...wow, that guy sounds like a jerk
yeah
03inb4 LL's comment about 99% of the male gender
12one of these days
/me hides
lmao
12cake
03you got a Weird Al song stuck in my head
03thanks a lot
03o/` it's just one of those days o/`
03o/` just one of thoes, one of those days o/`
how about this one
12i was scrolled up

03I actually haven't heard this in a while, but it's an awesome song
03...my teacher just said something about not knowing German
03and here I thought math was a universal language
bbl
Is that skype?
03OK :<
and now poof
03oh god now we're talking about how calculus got started
No, that's steam's built in chat service thingy
03yay teachers going off on a tangent
/me killed for math joke
they should stay in their radius?
o.o
Watt did you say?
It hertz
:P
03I've made a joke lik ethat before
03"I just stubbed my toe and it megahertz"
ohmygoodnessohmygoodness
for me it might be kilohertz
Why u quote Lopez
03wait
03that was a George Lopez quote? :O
sorta
The 'megahertz' part is
XD
03reall
03y
4So....
03I
8YOU'RE GONNA DIE CLOWN!
4I don't know what happened
03I LOVE that show, I'm honestly surprised I haven't heard it o_O
4But I exited
Mr. Electridad or whoever
o.o
YOU KNOW
Steam hates you.
4No, my comp froze mid game
:(
If DCD can do this, it will be so awesome. /)*3*(\
4So then when it started working again, I was stuck in limbo
03OK so
Ghosties : /
03why must my teacher always write series like {a_n} ?
4So did I die?
4Dman?
03just writing a_n should suffice :|
/me lazy and doesn't feel like making brackets in his notes
DCD, drop an awesome one liner if you do this.
also
4Because I was moving around and I was there for a while
I dunno u disconnectd : /
4Well
GODDAMN MAL, WHY ARE YOU DOWN?
here is one people might say during meditation
OHM
OHM
4I WAS IN LIMBO
I CAN'T ACCESS THAT SHIT
03hah
LOL
I must resistor else
8wepon
You deserve an M1873
Just for that
right
or maybe I should store my bad jokes
03http://sale.images.woot.com/Resiste2zDetail.png
but a microfarad is not enough
nice
I suppose I should tell Mr. Capacitor to wait with Ms. Inductor
they don't want to make a Henry just yet
I need to generate some more insulation
:x
03LOL
03inb4 1.21 gigawatts
Of course
because that would be a situation for Ms. Inductor that megahertz
guess it isn't a busy livestream today, huh. not many peeps here
I guess that one went over everyone's head
03nah, I got it
03I'm just busy writing notes
Shall I relay that information?
Well that was a refreshing round of Killing Floor.
Or shall I sing Diode to joy?
03LMAO
03I swear there's some site you guys are getting these all from
Nope
I figured you would get that drf
O.o
not here either
because inductor+capacitor=tuned circuit
i beat eternal night and the dragon challenges
i had to do it over again
the frequency of which varies based upon the values of the capacitor and inductor
6:O
game data was corrupt
DesSur, I lost 75hp within 1 second D: ;__;
6Yeah,I remember that from earlier :P
This conversation is fluxing out of control x.x
Ouch
*bawww*
yep i beat it now
03LOL
now i just have to level up
should I relay the meaning to you?
again
6._.
03...OMG
I'd prefer my gates shut :P
03my teacher just said "we'd have a smaller log"
03I immediately thought IRC
i didn't fully level up the 1st time
03:x
Lolwhat
XD
Haha
03even though he means logarythms
03or whatever the spellin gis
03log(x)
6What where the feathers for again? Did they unlock some art or something?
or will you need a fuse more minutes
Logaree :)
yes
03then you have ln(x) or natural log
Yes.
Why do you refuse to break up
Ouch.
:p
GO GHOSTIES!
03anyway, continue your punny discussioln
03-l
Ghosties, Ghosties he's our mod, if he can't do it we'll start again!
6I really ought to play it again..I barely remember anything.. :P
OH LORD
lol
KOTETSU'S HAT WILL BE PRODUCED
12going to play 360 with BL
12BBL
Lolbai
03alright :<
LL is the collector, DRF is the emmiter and I'm the base .v.
GHOSTIIIIEEEESSSSS
Or something
DAZ SUPPORTS YOU ALL THE WAY DO IT
no
DRF is the base
you are the emitter HML
He belongs to us?
Shame
or maybe you have too much of a bias current
Did he died?
Aren't there any more direct ways to think?
Or is this all alternative speak
:<
we all died
but Ghosties
HE DOIN IT MAN
just go with the flow
I hope there isn't a leak somewhere
yep it would be a very open situation
SUDDENLY KARMA CHARGER
I suggest we switch and close the contact
but not in short order
03OK I think this discussion has gained way too much current
XD
Sure
03not like I care, I'm just bored XD
KUHnife
03and nowhere near as good as thinking of puns as you two
03hm
03my laptop says 35 minutes of battery remaining
6Do you play Sims?
DRF's mind has variable resistance on this :<
03turning the backlight brightness down to half actually made it last quite a bit longer o.o
Aha
03I generally keep it all the way up when it's plugged in
perhaps so
03because this screen isn't one of those insanely bright ones
good job jeremy
03now my desktop, on the other hand, those are LED backlit and it's literally like STARING INTO THE SUN
03I have the brightness at 25%
but his frequency is quite low
drf i have my laptop plugged in most of the time
03so do I
03hence why I don't mind that it has a crappy battery
if it's not it's to sit downstairs in the not heat
I swear, installing XP updates to this thinkpad R40 (15GB HDD) is slow as anything x.x
03but all the plug outlets in this classroom are along the wall and I'm sitting in the smack dab middle of the classroom. LOL
03HML
03you know why?
Why? :p
03it's not updates, it's anytime you write anything to your hard drive
03it slos everything down
03*slows
yeah XD
03so installing programs etc
But blah
03even downloading a file, in theory, would make your computer lag
maybe too much of the power is being reflected back toward him
03hence why I download everything to EXTERNAL hard drives
03now, if you had a solid state...
03but even *I* don't have any solid states and I have like 20 hard drives :|
I wonder why not
XD
8giggle at the ghosties, ghosties
or there is too much external stuff going in
03because let's face it, once you get past 64GB they're just plain expensive and 64GB can hardly hold Windows 7
he might need a Killroy

03well, 64GB can hold the actual OS but I have like 200GB of programs, I kid you not
03so that...still doesn't really work
03so until I can get say a 256GB solid state for a reasonable price, :|
the giggling gives him powah
looks horrible on non-fixed width font
D:
3 years
XD
/me lurks
yay fixed-width font
03by then I'll already have a couple petabytes
/me hides
maybe longer
/me ninjahugs Nittany_Tiger
not really
lol
Hi.
/me throws glitter at Nittany_Tiger
i play animal crossing
/me explodes
add an apostrophe pls
in 10-15 years
how do you do actions?
/me
We'll be able to do SSD RAID
.v.
ah
yea, /me, followed by whatever you want
03...
03you already can
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
thanks
03HML, I should show you this video
/me Sees Nittany_Tiger explode. Twice.
03this guy took like 25 SSDs and RAID0'd them all together
Let me guess
Yes
12hi player :)
03and then showed how hardcore they are
I only exploded once.
I saw that
XD
03jumped up and down on a trampoline
03while holding the
03m
03it was awesome
12Hello Umbreon :3
12:)
I am surprised they could afford them
XD
03well HML
03the video was made by Samsung
/me yanws
03to show off their own hard drives
03you'd assume the manufacturer can afford their own products LOL
I see things twice >_<
hello
Maybe XD
once in Killing floor, another time in livestream, as it's about 5 seconds behind lol
but 25 sata ports?
did they die by themselves?
8ghosties killed them with his mind
03oh, that
03well
03you can get like 4-port SATA RAID cards for pretty cheap
03so just figure
03RAID0 them so it's like 4+4+4+4+4 etc
03then RAID0 those all together using hte motherboard
03:P
You're back on KF? Is there a slot on the server?
They're alive!
Scratch that. I'm writing something.
WHAT THE FUCK MAN
03I mean, if it wasn't SSD that would be a HUGE Trap
hey i g2g
ttyl
uh oh
03because RAID0 is like the most risky thing you can do to your data
Did you died already?
have a pleasant evening
...yea ;__;
Hello fragents XD
fllipping FleshPound : /
*fragmenta
sprsonmonj'
Bah
Pro-tip: Zombies can kill you.
Or whatever happens to said data XD
03no
03it's not that
03basically, say you have 4 hard drives in a RAID0
03you'd have 4TB worth if you have 4 1TB drives, right?
Yes
At least... I think they can...
03well you know how hard drives aren't perfect
03say one of those 4 hard drives die
03not only do you lose that 1TB
Of course :P
03you lose all 4
Ouch o.o
03and it's 100% impossible to ever recover that data, because of how RAID0 stores it.
03so yeah
I'd rather have a RAID3 array
i think
03I'd only ever do a RAID0 if it was totally not important data, and in that case why even bother?
it's the one where if any one drive fails it's not catastrophic
03yeah
03you're thinking of RAID5, i think.
03that's what I have
you just lose the capacity of one
035 2TB drives that give me 8TB of storage
n-1
03and one of them is for backup
oh
probably
03well
03there *is* a RAID3, but I have no idea what it is
yeah
03from my understanding it's basically the same thing as 5
03it just stores the data different
it's probably lower or higher level
03prolly
03RAID5 takes a sum.
as in clusters/bits etc.
yes, yes they can. And they did : /
03and keeps either a 0 or a 1 on the last drive, as the sum of the bits on the rest
03if that makes sense
___ ___
| (_) | | (_) |
\___/___\___/
|_____|
XD
03my friend explained it to me, it totally makes sense in my mind xD
10o.o
I found that face to be hilarious
03I'd add more hard drives to my RAID5 array but I'm using all of my motherboard's SATA connectors .-.
03and I bought this super rare board that has 12(!) connectors.
03well, technically only 11 work which I find dumb
03the last one is shared between onboard and eSATA so if you ues it, no eSATA
lol
i have an eSATA port on my laptop
same
06Yawn
XD
!espeon
;3
it's eSATA/USB somehow
i just use it as USB
03yyep
03*yep
Firewire, esata, 1 powered USB, 3 other usb and one displayport
03my laptop has that too
o.o
03eSATA is awesome in theory, but I can never get it to work x.x
I have never tried it
i'd like to get an external drive or enclosure that could use it
03I have two
03but see
03what I did
03was bought an eSATA to USB 3.0 adapter and I'm using that as my motherboard has USB 3.0
03anyway class is over. bbl
06:3
7Well, now that that's over with, I can finally get to playing piano!
8protip: shoot the monsters with your gun until they die
/me headdesks
That's what I've been doing wrong!
lol
who's avoirdupos?
DesSur?
12bbl
12But first
not much going on in here today, huh
12:3
NON-FIXED MOTHERFUCKER
DO YOU KNOW IT
/me idle
Nope.
12you don't leash dragons and expect to walk away from it
12:P
Was way too hot to do anything today.

order is randomised
(movies and episodes order)
And the lottery is saturday this week.

12noooo

final countdown
Picked at random to determine what horrible fate awaits us the following week.
Oh great, now I have to put that song on...
12no pizza doctors for you
Lol
i would, but then i won't hear my teammates talking olol
i muted the game completely as some have low mic settings

Also, it was teh smexs, Ghosties.
Ghosties you sound like a gentleman who by day studies the finer points of life with fine wine and by night OWNS ZOMBIES LIKE A BAUWS
Dman: If I tried the English accent though, it'd be corny.
4Haha, thanks guys
lol
4DesSur sounds familiar, though
7Any conversation at the mo'?
I didn't say much = family asleep as it's 3am here
4Like I've talked to him IRL
In what way, "familiar"?
*shrugs* idk
Hm.
also TF2 wont work on my laptop x.x
I'm from New York.
4You sound like a friend I used to know
Been there?
it would raep the CPU
Also, does my voice sound SUUUUPER deep? because it does when other friends record me
4No, I haven't been to NY
I had you muted so I couldn't hear your voice. :(
7Dunno exactly, but reduce the settings?
4Dman, you kinda sound like RBD
Describe your friend, Ghosties.
RAINBRODASH is my British Bro
So you guys finished now?
4Usually has a long beard and short hair. Is quiet, pretty shy, doesn't like to socialize with people
only hav'ta watch about 10 seconds, but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFHqvpXVpx8&feature=channel_video_title
6>.<
Is THAT HOW deep my voice sounds?
6I just hope the new game'll be good..
Just take out the long beard, and that's almost me.
Ghosties who's that? RBD?
Is he Asian?
4Hah, yeah, you two sound alike Dman
but..that video...
Is my voice that deepsounding to you?
4No, my friend's from the same state I'm in
or was it my friend's computer that made it that deep?
4RBD has a pretty soft voice, actually
i know right ^^
4Really, DesSur? Hmm
oh ok, I just wanna know, because i DO NOT have that deep a voice. so you hear my voice like in that video?
D:
Ghosties: You sound like someone I used to know too. But this is odd.
What is this, Snatcher?
9we're live
*refreshes stream*
Hi. Another word for "reduced." Have one on the tip of my tongue.
CLaDuN?
4DesSur, what's your steam name?
Wat?
6I think it will.. :3

Avoirdupois, Ghosties.

^ lol
9lemme fix something real quick

9there
MFW sound on my computer is suddenly dead? O_o

4Sent a friend request, I believe
4DesSur
Ghosties, I got it. I just accepted your request.
4I would have, Dman, but I can't get it to work on my laptop ;(
4Thanks, Des :)

03I was driving on the freeway behind some idiot going way too slow, and randomly on my shuffle, the song Move by Ludacris came up
03I started rapping along
03it was fun

Oh lawdy...
Is that...
though i don't like rap at all
KAMEN
RIDER
???
03XD
03and then
03the song What I've Done by Linkin Park came up
Who wants a Monday Night Combat 3 day pass?
03which... sadly seems to describe me
03o/` Put to rest what you thought of me, while I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty o/`
If nobody else wants it, I'll take it
lolsure

oh god, latest fanfic on Equestria Daily involves sea ponies
>sea ponies
>huh
D:
see, the other 3 ponies share the fact that they can spend time on the same areas
so sea ponies would split the pony communitues and that would make someponies sad
so no sea ponies for G4 pleaaaaase

You know you want to stay here.
12i've played tf2
With us...
Good! Mostly been on Minecraft and trying to figure out what's wrong with my router!
12i don't find it addicting
Forever...

It's why i can't make so many Brony Movie Nights, cuz i have work to doooo
Skipping what I had to do today was enough.
FOREVER
12at most it's an average game
i find it kind of annoying because it's either idiots or no-lifers playing
OH SHI- it's thursday.
My assignment is due tomorrow.
12yes'
It is.
Shit.
I thought it was Tuesday.
OH SHI- it's been friday for 3 and a half hours lol
wait wat
12which is why we should make a private TST tf2 server
Crap. My streaming supposed to happen on Saturday. DIDN'T MAKE A SCHEDULE FOR IT.
-heart attack-
At least I've been pretty productive this week on my thesis.
7You know we already have one, Glacy?
Also, Fall Funding!!!!!!!!!
in true 4chan /v/ fashion:>thinking it's tuesday on a friday. I seriously hope you guys on't do this :P_
[10:33:13 pm] <+Jared> c:
[10:33:38 pm] <+Jared> rofl.
+ the rest
12yes
DesSur streams?
GIEF LINK
I don't do chans
12but TST deserves 2 servers
12:)
Dman: On Steam.
I rarely do, and never post. can be funny
I don't mix up days like that.
So my date screw-ups are of my own mistake.
7o.O
Dessur: steam? stream?
7I don't think we have enough players to populate two servers. XD
Dman: No, I'm giving you the link over Steam.
If I forget what day it is it's not because I think it's a different one.
7But if DRF's the admin of one, he can meddle around with us.
12sure we do
wait NewDCD are you talking to us? If so i should raise the volume on the livestream to reply
12doesn't that make it more interesting?
7If they're on different rotations, sure!
Wanna watch me stream me playing a space flight simulator where I'm flying a moon rocket?
03LOL
sure
03implying I actually abuse my power >_>
It's the easy way, though.
Oh ok then
7Don't take TF2 seriously at all. :P
*raises volume cuz was lowered when on Killing Floor*
12considering the last time i ever saw drf kick someone was like never
Apollo 11 a.k.a. Luna Rescue Mission 1.
03exactly
I might do 13 w/o failures on.
I did 11.
12if anything he doesn't abuse it enough D:
03I've been a super-admin over at HoSHiNET for years and don't think I've ever kicked anyone
/me hides
12lol
03I mean
he can. but he doesn't, usually.
03Usually I kill people if they request it
03like when someone doesn't have their nick registered
03and they ping
again, i've seen waay worse
03which happens all too frequently
now split between watch one or other stream
039 times out of 10 I'm the only one here who can do it :P
12there is something called ghosting drf
Took me three tries to fly Apollo 11 without dying.
03"Like when someone doesn't have their nick registered"
12oh
03ghosting only works on registered nicks.
12then tell them to register their nick
12XD
ok i'm here again
Why are you solid snake, NewDCD?
03that's not going to help when they have no control over it
12i know
12do black mail
Oo

03wait
03you have +W?
Bob is Gabe Newell.

12o_O
If DCD wins, EP3 is delayed by another year.
12only ircops have +W
oh and voice is a little too low now as gamevolume a little too loud
03not really
Bob is Gabe Newell combined with horrible nightmare fuel....ravenholm
12yes
12but usually the only ones who have it is ircops
We go to ravenhall
so NewDCD do you know much about PSP homebrewing and stuff like that?
XD
03that's why I asked if he had +W|
I'm part of the Redstone Development Foundation. :D
?
12i always think he's a she
03though one of those custom addons that we installed on island *may* allow ordinary users to see who whoises them, it's just not called +w
I could have proved you wrong before
12i better start getting it right because he's 2 hours away from me tops

How about "Mildly annoying light rain ruins picnics: Ponies?"

This game contains snow
It's the only official english version
"Brony State: With Ponies"
Everfree Wind will contain more than wind (that's my title)/

: P desertman2 you played this or otehrs?
whoa
lol
but she's one of the best characters in the game so it's cool
in the games, sorry
I got logic! Before this, I was a brainless husk!
hahaha
Well
NewDCD are you still reading the livestream? so we can say stuff
to you
You use logic like you have been using for almost the ENTIRE LIFE OF YOURS
Duh
'give a man logic, and he'll reason for a lifetime'
ERGO
Set a man on fire, and you'll keep him warm for life.
i'm sorry, NewDCD, but your voice for Edgeworth is not doing him justice. Your Gumshoe is spot on though
Give a brony a blowjob, he will be clopping to ya for life ;D

what about both?

Gumshoe is a french detective who is also asian
I like to think that Equestria is another planet somewhere in SPACE~
So for me, a human, Earth Rotation

srsly

I think Equestria is a nation.
Is big
he's like everything
03saw that
well, whatever planet equestria is on
Who's talking?
Equestria is in each and every one of us
It's the Land of Equestria, not Planet.
dcd
I seee=
03my chemistry lab earlier, we were using this thing called a cockstop, I was like ":|"
DCD ofc!
o,o
Oh.
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
well, whatever planet equestria is on well, whatever planet equestria is on well, whatever planet equestria is on
TSSS
that noise
That planet has screwy weather and time issues.
Gunshoe did it
Needs DS2 noise every time a new victim is found.
o-o
i think it has normal weather but pegasi can affect weather also
Gumshoe did it!
Yeah.
often in fanfics you get 'stray clouds' or something like that
They seem to have 100% control over it in Ponyville.
that pegasi clean up / actually cause rain with
etc
Not in Everfree.
well yes 100% control in ponyville yet as their job they make thunderstorms and rain too so it works fine
it's epic
Guns are REALLY dangerous
If weather was 100% controlled by pegasi, RBD wouldn't need to go around clearing the skies would she?
See, severe weather can come from Everfree.
FUNFACT: gumshoe once showed an 8 y/o girl a gun to try and impress her
this is true. it's in the first game
lol
Define Gun

That was funny.
THAT was the best.

How much would you guys pay for a blind bag pony?

Blind bag pony...
what's that?
You know the ones with molded hair.
Depends on the pony.
RD
Trying to work out whether I should get one.
ah. those.
how much are they?
depends on price
12o-o
Lol, if I get one it's off eBay.
I think they're only sold in Germany.
Current top eBay price looks like $10+$5 shupping.
That's why I was asking how much people would pay for one.
:)
sounds fair.
03inb4 Maroon 5 - Misery
well. I'll be back in 12 hours, off to get some food and sleep.

03o/` this love has taken its toll on me, and she's said goodbye, too many times before o/`
Yup.

They probably have a long time to go though.
03no
03that video was stupid
03it was basically softcore porn

2 hours.
Oh.
03see
03I don't like music vidoes like that
How much for Rainbow Dash?

$15
XD
10$ for the 2 hour one.
Including P&P
Yeah.

At that price, I'd probably see if I could swing a complete set and maybe save on shipping costs.
hi Altair :d
And by complete set I mean just the mane 6.
how ya doin? :)
Altair!
good good
wbu?
/me pounces

I doubt you'll see complete sets.

ALTAIR

/me hugs~
/me glomps
I saw one with all the blind bag ponies at around $100.
lol
;D
Yeah, saw that.
hahahahahaha
dood
its like a pile now
yey
XD
Haven't seen a set of the mane 6.
DOG PILE ON ALTAIR EVERYONE
oh lawd
Hai Altair :D
But a lot of the others are all being sold by the same person.
Pretty good thanks, playing SL at the moment XD
You?
You'd have to win multiple auctions to do so.
i'm doing fine
super hot today
like
104F
and i was working in a closed warehouse
lol
Weather has gotten better today, it's been raining like hell these last few days, so I'm glad to finally see some sunshine
i'd like to see a little bit of rain, it's just hot and sunny every day here
I wonder how much the blind bags cost in Germany.
Sparkly Twilight Sparkle. :D
I'd rather the sun so wanna trade? XD
03OW MY FINGER
03WHY DOES IT HURT SO MUCH
03;.;
I paid £10 (free P+P) for one of the brushable RDs.
$2 I think.
Wow.
yes plz :D
Excellent!
Now....
now, we get bored with our new climates and request a tradeback
Gotta find a way to trade the weather
:D
XD
Yeah true dat
They are supposed to be coming to the US soon at least.
What's $2 in euros anyway?
http://static.arstechnica.net/2011/07/04/lion/system-info-storage.png
Slightly less than $2?
XD
Link. Ocarina. Hyrule
Someone at Ars Technical loves LoZ
$1.40
03small hard drives
12drf is small :<
03LOL
03I'm actually around average height
Funny that the RD ones cost so much more.
04XD
04he doesn't mean tha-
/me RUNS!!!
03LOL
Well yeah. It's cause everyone knows that rainbow pony is best pony.
HOLY

What are blind-bags?
Oh wow, $31.
/me puts kyu on his head
£22 including P+P. That's $35.8
07eep
03so Kyu
03I was watching Judge Judy earlier
03and XD
07lol
03this one lady got super pissed that she lost
03but then when they interviewed her at the end
03she was like "nah it's OK"
03XD
They're the boxes that you get a random 2" (I think) molded pony in.
07XD
Although they're not random.
Yes.
They have numbers on them which let you identify which boxes contain which ponies. XD
I smelled randomness in it.
Everyone is jumping on that one fluttershy. Meanwhile the next one in the queue is only $1.25 :D
14 hours to go though.
I bet it'll end up like the 2 hour one.
Yeah, it'll probably start going up the moment the 2H one is gone.
Ah, here we go.
Those are the blind bag ponies.
Lol
03I still didn't see anything in the credits about them being paid though.
03and I actually watched carefully X
03d
12FINALLY
12Danny
03?
12say something
12><
12fate has finally smiled upon me XD
03I just did
12...
12I was speakingh
12-h
12i got a 19 pound fish in OoT
03I can't hear you
03even when I unplugged my headset, nothing
03check your mic
12I did o.o
03well I'm not hearing anything...
Is it strange that I'd feel bad for winning eBay auctions that other people are bidding for.
Yes. Yes it is.
12...
12and nice Umbre
It just seems kind of...Mean.
12golden scale~~~
Especially if you do it last second, like I would.
The only way.
Also knowing that I'd be stealing the auction off some other brony. :(
I was really disappointed that I missed sniping that complete box of Alpha Centauri + Alien Crossfire list time it came up. Some other jerk double the price at the last second.
12not to max my wallet~
12o.o
12now
12that's the Skullatulas...
12i know
12i have 21
Doubled? Wow.
Other people wouldn't hesitate to bid-snipe.
12is this house for the future or past
Almost doubled. It was sitting at $50 with less than 30 seconds to go and then it jumped to $90 with 5 seconds to go.
Wow.
12shard of agony what
I'll be playing OoT after i Go on SSBB with my gf for awhile X3
12kay
12got the first wallet upgrade
12it's the "new" Stone of Agony
12i'll worry about the other one later :)
12since no rumble
12it dings
What are the Mcdonalds ponies?
12now bbl
12(again)
I don't think I've even seen any of them.
I think they were smaller version of the brushables.
12such a hard thing to get
12lol
Molded hair?
12probably almost pointless to get too
Ah, not what I was thinking.
Here.
http://mylittleponycollecting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/mlp_mcdonalds2.png
Mane looks molded, tail does't.
I am confuse.
doesn't*
I think that's right.
MFW Celestia
And the base splits apart. It's a comb.
THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO SELL THEM
WHY IS SHE STILL PINK?
I thought they said it was just a marketing ploy. :/
Oh, interesting.
http://i.imgur.com/fvPcY.png
Do you think the toys will ever come to the UK? :/
Lol.
03Verizon is trolling me
MFW lies.
03I try to upload a pitcure from my phone and then it randomly loses reception
Of course not. Nothing good ever goes to the UK.
03and then gets it back right after I cancel it >_>
Have you seen the horrible tacky glittery wings on one of the Celestia toys?
I honestly haven't looked at any of the toys before tonight.
Meh, I've always wanted one of the blind bag RDs.
If I ever saw one in person, I might be tempted.
Might...?
MIGHT?!
Lol.
/me has a papercraft RBD on his desk
Meh, a real toy would be so much better.
:P
:p
LOL
12o-o
03there, I used wifi, less than one second a picture
03take that, 3G
12drf is a wifi maniac
03I just tend to not like using Wi-Fi on my phone since it disables the 3G service which ends up becoming annoying if I leave my house
03LOL I love how they actually make baby monitors now that are essentially webcams
03back when I was little they were like giant walkie talkies and even that was high tech
12so much blue and green
12D:
0304or I could talk in red to shake things up
:o
12lol
12that doesn't look right on you drf
03I was trying to shake things up, so sue me
03OK so
03a few hours ago I get a missed call from this random unknown number
03they leave a voicemail
03for some John person
03saying they're late for a doctor's appointment
03what should I do LOL, I just ignored it
03but I feel bad since they're prolly legitimately trying to contact someone and have the wrong number
03what sorta annoyed me though was that my voicemail CLEARLY says "Hi, this is Danny, I can't answer the phone right now" and they continued to ask for John >_>
03and not been like "wait, maybe we have the wrong number"
12ok
/me sues drf
04bbl
12kk
03LOL, sues me for what
03I remember once I got a voicemail from some obviously drunk guy at like 3am saying he wanted me to pick him up at a bar
03I just laughed going "poor guy never got a ride'
12only doing what was asked of me
12should have texted him back saying you'd be there in 5 minutes
12then just lay back
03um
03it was a Beaumont hospital
03last time I checked, hospitals don't have texts
12oh
12ohhh voice mail
12wait
12a drunk guy was calling you wanting to pick him up at a bar but the number came from a hospital?
03no
03two separate occasions
03the hospital was today
03the drunk guy was a few years ago
12i was talking about the drunk guy
03ah
03I could have, but see he left me a voicemail at 3am and I was asleep
03didn't see it until I woke up around 7
12yes
03so it wouldn't have helped probabl
03y
12when you woke up you should have replied
12saying you'll be there in 5 minutes
12drf learn to mess with people
12XD
03LOLX
03-X
03I hate doing that when it involves giving people my phone number though
03if they dial a wrong number then they probably won't bother dialing it again
12they naturally already had your number though
12it's in call history so XD
03well it depends
03he could have been using a payphone at the bar for all I know
12XD
I want a toy RBD.

12o.o
Bought one of the brushable RDs off eBay.
Looking at getting blind bag version too.
:O
Nice
Then maybe McDonalds RD.
Since nothing ever comes to the UK. >_>
Awesome.
I has no ponies yet
if they would only release Spike in a pack of his own
Haha.
Is Spike your favourite character?
without needing to buy the Celestia pack or Twilight's balloon
yeah
and then Pinkie Pie
and the RD
and then all the other ponies
and last but not least
The fluttershy blind bag pony on eBay is ridiculous.
Gilda
$35.80
O.O
Including P+P
It's a 2" pony. XD
holy crap that's expensive
It costs $2 in Germany apparently.
Which is the only place you can get blind bag ponies at the moment I think.
Though they're supposed to be going to the US sometime (but still nothing for the UK D:)
How much are the brushable ponies in the US?
5 US dollars
plus tax
comes out to about 7 bucks
Hmm, pretty cheap.
I paid £10 including P+P
6sdwaefsgfsg
yeah, this is if you buy them at retail
12Roara
amazon.com sells them for at least $15
12BL says hai
6hiiiii to her too
Yeah.
03LOL what
03saying hi to yourself
@pony
WOOHOO
forgot Big Mac
he's tied with Spike for favorite character
if they release a Big Mac toy
shut up and take my money hasbro
XD
03LOL "ihug"
03why have I not noticed that before
because I recently requested to switch ISP
and I switched internets today
03ah
03so do you still have bandwidth caps?
still 45gb
03:<
03so there are no ISPs in NZ that are unlimited?
well, it's off to bed for me
03you know what would be cool? Finding a way to pirate HughesNet
/me hides
see you later
03as that's basically satellite powered ISP
you could, but you'd pack a fraking ton
12BL's going to bed but I'm not tired o-o
03Heh
like $300 or something ?
03that sucks

long insects
bee hives

03my remixes tend to be fairly simplistic
and just because you have a good tool, doesn't mean you know how to use it well
03I basically just rearrange parts of songs
03for In paradise I just chopped out the slow parts and made it all upbeat xD

Remixing is not rearranting a song, or change instruments
or midiremixing rather
uhoh
:(
Yes
changing an instrument isn't remixing, either, SS
03um
03well

Heh
Junh, hence why i said midimixing ;p
03well, my edits vary
6I wondr how far he can run?" thinks to self
03some of them are just taking the swearing out of songs that don't have clean versions
03others are rearranging them

03*:P_
03and I mean yeah sure you can add as many popup options as you want
03I just don't care
03since
03I do it all with aliases
03I have a /gyarados script on my desktop
03^ basically that
XD
03anime reference
6ok? you call for Icy and he answers, but you dont even say anything else>Suinide
03so I just do /gyarados [nick] [gender] and yeah
03so in a way, anything that can be done with right-click popups can be done with aliases. </nerd
I won the Twilight Sparkle blind bag pony BTW.
6ok, Ive see those to many times, what does BTW mean exactly?

in photoshop, you use the healing/patch/clone tool to "paint over" blemishes. you do a similar thing in audition, if you can spot it out.
12Dammy
03that's because I have a server which seems to bring up tons of hits

03like the whole YouTube "you can't upload anything that isn't yours" crap
03remember back when that script did work
03and you did the whole his_laptop thing
12that's why someone needs to make a new video site

12wait that was me that messed it up? XD
03no
03don't worry, you didn't cause any actual damage
12i don't remember
03it just made it say his_laptop had like 0 hits
12really
03even though it has tons
12no
03I've been considering making my video site into an actual video site, problem is the copyright companies, they'd sue me to hell and back

03the only thing about google that I think is actuall evil
03+y
03is Google Analytics
03basically
12they have everything from free cars for you to drive around whenever you want to like high technology sleeping things
03they collect data on what people search for
03and mine it
03in huge server farms
03who knows what they do with all that data
03you know?
03so just the concept of that makes me kinda weary

03that's why?
Lawl.

03I thought they just both got hired by Best Buy

Jersey Shore in italy.....
03I mean worst buy

12honestly? if you had to do a commercial with justin because you said something bad about him
03why did I call it by its proper name
12like 90% of the world population would have met him irl
I like Best Buy, just sayin'
12me to

<Pattyrick> Jersey Shore in italy..... <-- LOLwut, that thing doesnt exist, it can't be considered a show
12too*
Exactly
it's terrible
03<Pattyrick> I like Best Buy, just sayin' <- you must have spare money to throw around then :P
I feel bad for the Italians
03I used to like Best Buy until I realized I can buy things for like half the price elsewhere
03then I was like no
I like their customer service and their selection
not Geek Squad, though
03dude, their customer service is terrible
03LOL
03heck
12i'll say
that's their weak point
03I applied to work for geek squad
03they didn't hire me
03I was too smart :|
/me hides
12the guys who do the "will it blend" series
03well
12lol
03the main thing I hate about Best Buy
12tried to return their blended camera to best buy and they wouldn't take it
03again all comes down to evil business tacits
03*tactics
03if you've ever heard of bait-and-switch scams
Hahaha.
03Best Buy was actually accused of doing that and sued in federal court for it
03Not sure what the outcome was.
You are; Geek Squad seems to hire idiots
03Basically, Best Buy sells computers, right
03they put all this crap software on it
03that they tell you makes your computer run better
03than when you go back to complain
03they charge you to remove the software that they put on in the first place
hmm
03that's my main reason for hating them, as that's just horrible business
Well, my computer is crap
03that, combined with the fact that they're overpriced, it's like NOPE.AVI

IT TOOK ME 2 DAYS TO BEAT LEVEL 1
I don't play such games.. or any at all, really.

I should get a new router. :\
06you should
06got Eminent :D
well
it's not as bad as having a connection that goes at dial-up speed
which is mine right now lol
06dial-up?
06classic
Ahh...
I remember People PC
that was so totally 2002 xD
06could've watch a movie or two, THEN one page should be done loading :D
my school connection is worse than dialup
SCREW THIS PIECE OF
sure, it's faster
my school connection hates linux
but it's so unreliable it only works for irc /sometimes/.
and what only works /sometimes/ for IRC, really doesn't work for anything else.
lol my school blocks stuff
ours don't
we have to go through a proxy
:>
before we can connect to anything
and they block things from that
it's so damn annoying
we've a proxy, too, but it doesn't filter stuff. It only logs us in.
after that it's all free.
ah
lucky
>:
I have to use CGI:IRC to get on IRC
I've seen Facebook blocked sometimes, but never reliably.
else, nothing.
heh
I have a heap of reasons to grass on CGI:IRC
I also use strange ports for irc.
the only server I use 6669 for is ocean.
6697, I mean.
Ah
06heya Quan
7Hey, light.
successfully moved over the server
hi Quan =D
the new server is bloody fast
and is infinitely more stable
I'm pretty sure the data files were kept
7Hey, Pattyrick and NS.
but check just in case
hey :p
7Will do.
7After Firefox loads up all its other windows and tabs. :P
xD
7Hey, Lakorv.
how are you?
7Testing out NS's updated server.
7It has glitches. D:
what glitches?
tell me so I can fix them before I sleep
7Well, I just had lag, so that might've been the problem.
o_O
ah
7But the game ended after one second. :P
uh...try again?
7Now it's normal.
ah okay
7But I have a latency of 100 on the server. O.o
7That's higher than it should be. :P
7NS, what command was it to change maps?
uh
changelevel
you'll need to go through rcon though
7Ah.
that's what I'm getting
7o.o
it's the reverse DNS of the server
it's technically a site-hosting server but I'm running the game on it anyway
PING old.crashcraft.co.uk (64.37.49.28) 56(84) bytes of data.
that's the old server
it's probably because of the location
new server is in the netherlands or germany
germany I think
7Huh.
it has a faster download speed though
old one was something like 2mbps
this one has a 100mbps connection, and the first time I tested it downloaded at 10mpbs
15:20:59 up 21 days, 0 min, 1 user, load average: 0.12, 0.10, 0.04
and that's the uptime so far
7Okay.
anyway, I can't really move it back because the other server is about to expire
something like 3-5 days
don't want to risk it
I could move it to a US-based server if you really need it
if it's lagging too much I will
7Hmm...
I have some pretty fast servers in the US
7I'd really have to see with other people how badly lag would affect the game.
try testing the latency of 66.228.39.128
7Put that as a serer?
7server*
uh
go to command prompt and ping it
7Okay.
7 144 ms.
you could also try 96.126.123.201
they're both US servers
7 142 ms. o3o
yeah, I'm getting 253 from the first one
214 from the second
but that's considering I'm getting a 300ms one from TST's server :p
7Hmm.
heh
try pinging 85.17.180.107
that's in the netherlands
7 139 ms.
not bad
well, I'll move it if it lags too bad
just test it out and tell me
7It's fine for one person. :P
7I would like to test with multiple people on it.
yeah, ask Xeli
or someone else
/me 7pokes Espeon
I can't test it for you since my connection is going at dialup speeds and I'm on linux
but it's not too much work for me to move it, it's just sitting there and waiting for the download to finish lol
anyway, time to sleep, will see you tomorrow hopefully
7Okay.
7o.o
7Well, I somehow fudged up my TF2 when changing maps.
7My mistake, NS, not yours.
brb
06i'm in deep shizz now...
7Why?
06bloodtest tommorow X.x
7Not that bad. :/
06I FFIN HATE NEEDLES
o_O
06and i MAY have a little problem, ever heard of tunnel vision?
7Oh, I pressed `, I think, between maps (command for developer's console), and my screen went black.
06yep, i have that :/
7O.o
06its clear thatit aren't my eyes...proberly my brain, thats why we have the bloodtests, to see for some overproduction of hormones, Adrenaline, Glucose, etc.
ah
well zzz
7o.o
7Well, it's for your own good.
7And I hated needles too, until I got used to them. x.x
06yep
06not now i'm afraid, i have to go to the shop in a few, only here to check up on things :/
7Okay.
7Will YOU help test NS's server? :P
/me pokes back
sure
7Just to see how well it preforms with multiple players. And to see how much lag affects me.
06i'm sorry quan :/
06and gotta go~
7Hey, that's all right.
ok, logging on. Taking its sweet time
7Hmm.
ok, there we go. It's downloading an update
7I see you're on, Espeon.
7Ah.
06:P
7Care to test out NS's server?
06kind of where I'm heading :p
06aaaand it connects at least
7o.O
o-o
sleeeeeeeeeep
7So apparently, connecting to the server is slow.
7I see you at least connected. :P
06it feels less laggy than it was in the old location at least
I'll get to that tomorrow then
Xeli
it's in germany XD
06awesome:3
06suddenly I have pretty much the same ping as my net gets on speedtest
lmao
well zzz
06~
Minnet: how long has your server been running?
Lakorv: The computer went up 2 days, 14 hours and 52 minutes ago.
k, I'm in
now just gotta get in the server
7We are testing.
06to me it's almost like playing on a local server LOL
06this far at least, instant hit registration but we'll see how it deals with some players (or bots, rather)
ok, how do I put in the password?
never mind!~

7Well, that fails.
06seems like it o.o

7Nope.
06and not easy for us to check what went wrong either =s

Hey there Purple 'Prose
Oo
/me shoots Espeon as Imogen Heap's Hide and Seek plays as background music. "Mmmm whatcha say, Mmm that you only meant well? Well of course you did ... "
06So, besides it crashing the connection certainly wasn't bad for me. And quan, the freezing lag you got - did the sound get all "hung up" when it happened or just the visual part?
06because if the audio got all ... scratch in the record-ish then it's probably not the server :P
7Well, the sound loop occurred once, though the game did seem slowed visually at times.

7o.O
7Hmm...
7Most likely, with some unusual reason why not to.
06It is a little bit odd when there's no bodies and such. I have ragdolls turned off but gibs turned on so it's a bit weird
/me 7blinks.
06But that's just me wanting moar FPS even though it's reasonably playable anyway
7Speaking of, those latest items are big FPS killers.
06yeah the death animation is appearently
DCD! :D
06one of the most complext things in the game xD
06LOTS OF PARTICLES
7Well, the death animation was borrowed from Half-Life. :P
06yeah, quite similar to the animation when someone's hit by the combine ball thing
7Imagine a server full of Soldiers using those items. :O
7Well, maybe not imagine.
06was on one yesterday. Not everyone was a soldier but at least 70% of the server

My time is UTC +8
Eeek.
Not good
two bombs
Oh frak.
government area.
Prime minister safe.
Terrorist related?
no idea.
I hate it when such things happen in countries like yours
Binary just told me he's watching it on TV
12oww
I shudder to think of it happening in mine's
'looks seriously damaged'
Imagine a bomb going off on a crowded rapid transit train here... Eeepage.
You know
All those messages telling us to be on guard has filtered down on me
Once I spotted a huge box on a train as I was getting off
alerted station staff there about it, telling them where the train was going, train car number, stuff
Hope it was just nothing
Now, if that was... ><

photo of the explosion, 20 sec after: https://yfrog.com/kinyqpej
06what explosion?!
Oslo, capital of Norway; two bombs just a lil' ago now today.
almost no intact windows in the area, 8+ injured, no known deaths
06ohmai
that's mostly what I know.
06i hope no-one was hurt
dammit
deaths confirmed.
06crap
several deaths, count still uncertain; dozens being medically treated; all roads in the area closed
The police is asking people in the area to reduce the mobile phone usage

7Thanks. :D
7Meet up at least 15 minutes before in the IRC? :P
12k
But they don't seem as interested in Gokaiger as they were Shinkenger and Magiranger (Which we haven't finished yet)
7Hey, Chim.
They're much more interested in OOO right now
7Same for you, just checking in on your joining of the community game. :P
Shinkenger is awesome
12However, if I suddenly bork, you’ll know why XD
I've been trying to get them Shodo phones D:
and myself a Sushi changer
7Yep.
7Well, Espy and I tested NS's server earlier today.
7It borked. D:
What are you talking about?
Shinkenger

I think Goseiger's problem is that it's happiness and rainbows inbetween Awesome Samurais and Pirates more than anything
of course it's cool in Washington
I think had it been between something else it'd be considered average than unfairly trashed
I think it's cute fluff but I can understand the disappointment from coming off of Shinkenger
12Seems so nice there ; ;
04later :B
12that's more or less what i have XD
7O.o?

Apparently GameSpot was brutal with this game's review
for science, not justice
lol
4.5/10
for science, for justice, for RARITY
meh, Gamespot only gives positive reviews to developers who pay them off
^
Spike grew up into a spikey-haired Hero of Justice
10^^
I don't pay attention to game review sites.
Yeah, it seems GameSpot's been a bit biased in the last decade or so
Especially Gamespot.
This is wanting me to play Monster Hunter Tri on Wii now...but that damn Desert Rex thing keeps raping my arse
I used to go there for the Unions, but since they basically said "fuck you" to them all, I've stopped going
"GOING FORTH!"
OSU!
FOR RUBIES
>Implying anyone can fuck Spike up
Do a barrel roll!
I'm just a passing through baby dragon. Remember that!
PRESS R TWICE
YOUR ADVANTAGGE
lol, is anyone else half expecting to see DMC themed: "stylish!" appear?
Yep
can you get a lance in this game?
Oh God Yes, Spike needs a Lance
CAPCOM!
and a horse
but spike needs a lance : /
HISSATSU: FOR MY PRINCESS BODY SLAM!

FANTASTIC
amazing job, spike!
good job, get back parasprite! GO! SPIKE!
Ooh, we need some Two Steps From Hell playing with the final boss battle
ooooo NewDCD I request you play some TwoStepsFromHell while on final boss
i'm gonna play it myself if not: P, but then no one else will hear it : /
They do movie trailer music and what not, it's like modernized classical music
yup!
and everyone I mean EVERYONE knows 'heart of courage'
They do grand epic musical masterpieces (and epic can be rightfully used here without sounding tacky)
even if you haven't got a clue of the songname / artist
How about NOAH from Jam Project?
Black Blade was the first song I heard from them
ohDave_brozilla, the new sherlock holmes 2 trailer uses 2 songs! : )
from TSFH
No way
That works
I remember the Harry Potter trailer used a TSFH song and then part of the original score
CHAOS EMERALD!
GET!
it's like the wilhelm scream. once you're aware, it's always in there somewhere. in trailers.
i've seen it used in videogame trailers too 0_o
Who else is there like TSFH?
I know E.S. POsthumous
Posthumus*
that's also a really well known one : D
but who else is there?
I mean, listening to that on my iPod while walking out of a convenience store buying a bottle of lemonade is nothing short of awe-inspiring
hhaahaha
Trust, some of the youtube comments for their songs are hilarious
ALL I CAN DO (YEAH!) ALL YOU CAN DO! (YEAH) *something something* TRANSFOOOORM!
yea i think the new sherlock holmes trailer also uses some es posthumus
"The anthem that plays when Chuck Norris takes a piss"
oh god dave_brozilla
I'll have to look it up for sho
Srsly, that was one of the best I read
2 highest comments on a hyoutube song: Thumbs﻿ up if you knew about this BEFORE Sherlock Holmes (2011) g2dashizal 5 days ago 169 I looked up the song after watching the Sherlock Holmes:﻿ A Game of Shadows trailer. abdelm2 1 week ago 85
look at how many likes, and the trailer came out a week ago. YOUTUBE COMMUNITY Y U SO IMMATURE AND STUPID?
Is this how Spike sees himself?
Bahamut wants to fight
Yup
ffs, everyone's arguing over who knew the songs first on youtube ;__;
oh hay, lunchie times! I'll bbl
i hear music
HEALING TOUCH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOCTOR!!!
IF ONLY RARITY COULD SEE THIS
HAHAHA guys remember when he says 'NO!' but the text reads 'YES'
also NewDCD, dude, please, play 'Encroaching Shadows'
:/ ok
there was another, "I walked out this morning listening to this music. Suddenly a Pterodactyl fell from the sky. I grabbed on to it and it took me to where Godzilla was destorying Chicago. I blasted him with a hadouken, went grocery shopping, then returned home to balance the checkbooks so the governemtn owed me a $50,000.:
what about 'severinc the chains of fate;?
it has good vocals

THis music totally made this game 200% cooler
Why not intergrate said apps then?
I'm gonna say no, I missed it.
I'm pretty sure their music can make anything cooler
AHHHHHHHH dammit
sigh
that indeed it did
Red Laser is one of the coolest I have seen
Barcode?
:o
You could put this soundtrack to the Twilight movies and they'd be cooler
basically an OCR program that reads barcodes and does comparison shopping for prices on the fly
10orr not?
Well that is useful :P
10Twilight is a lost cause :3
Well, the Twilight movies at least had Muse...
no it wouldn't...
how about i LEVERAGE your shit?
Since you can't do that with anything else
Software wise
twilight is doomed like that

what's the lotto link?
2 hours remaining...
aw crap
:2,15D
That means people are less likely to win since there'll be 250 entries instead of 60 and they are sure to be around instead of possibly not being there...

Well, lotto is tomorrow
7well since I killed skype (8gigs of ram / machine from 3months old) my stream has been up all the time
I need my voicebox back, sir.
dari, that's the list in normal order. that means I could put a character to put myself on top of list and cheat
WHAT HAPPENED
I'M SO CONFUSED
NOOOOOOOO
hey Aponymous
I just... what?
6My IRC has been working the whole time since I killed skype...
Stuff.
Hi Dermathil
We just take the names from the channel, then we still put them into the randomiser.
will we be allowed to give up our decision if we don't want to pick a movie/episode?
7IRC is not my trouble
6My stream is still dropping out randomly though. Oo
7the video stream is
7hmmm
It's just we get the names from the channel instead of a lottery thread.
But only active names, right?
7older machine then?
Everyone in here. If they're AFK we move on.
Simple enough.
10Vars reset
6After all, active doesn't mean they're not here.
Ehh, I suppose it works
Sure
What if the person chosen doesn't want to pick a movie.
6It just means they haven't said anything for a bit.
True
I have the stream open in 2 windows.
6Extra: If it comes to that, we'll move on, I suppose.
dari, do we have any way of filtering out the anons from the list?
Neither is dropping, Skype open.
9shit
Still doing the lottery tommorrow?
9Sprinkles
7eeeyup
9take over for me, man
When does the drawing begin?
TADAIMA
DCD: ?
Why does it matter Hipster? I can tell if people are opening up multiple connections.
6When you gonna be back, DCD?
02dead chat is dead(?)
oh, you can?
10Indeed
In time to do Toku, I hope...
didnt know that
9dunno
ah, alright. I'll probably only be there tomorrow. So I still get to be interested when I'll watch the movies.
can you tell automatically? or do you have to have reason to investigate it first?
6Before the stream, I hope... I haven't finished getting Black Dynamite.
just wondering :P
Nothing serious, I hope
6DCD, where'd you get Black Dynamite?
Automatically. A script.
8probably an issue with his mom
6Real quick mod chat, DCD.
10RandomExtra we've never had that. But I know how you feel
6And he's gone.
6FAWK
10I'm sure we'll address that if the situation arises :P
Well, GL Sprinkles. :P
@dari win, nice one
s'been enough death for me for a while.
I personally could understand not wanting to pick pony episode
and sprinkles you need a megaupload link, not a torrent, right?
Can't you just watch it on one of those online services, like megavideo.
But I know we haven't seen Griffon The Brush-Off on BMN yet, so that'll be my choice if I can't do movie
bye then, derma
I would love to pick another movie. I'm not sure about pony episode though.
AFK for a bit. Will be back in around 15-30 mins.
If i get picked by an A movie, it will be 007
i wish i were able to stream, cuz i have black dynamite on DVD
So whats happening
which one?
...you got about 30 007s, Lolipop, lol
Hello.
6I can't use megavideo here.
Ill do little miss sunshine
I have a list for each one if I get picked for anything
megavideo wont let you watch all the way through anyway
Black Dynamite drinking game comes up in suggestions for google.
I can hack megavideo anyway.
6Hipster, could you by any chance put your copy of Black Dynamite on megaupload?
To make it unlimited.
My A-/B+ movie would be GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, FEATURING VINCENT PRICE
ummm... how?
I think DCD and Sprinkles are talking
A: Leon: The Professional B: The Pagemaster
id pick a spiders web :S
7Ohh an easy way?
actually wait
6Copy it to your computer.
6And then upload it.
So apparently there's a Black Dynamite drinking game.
1 drink – every time someone says “brother”
1 drink – every time someone makes a fist
1 drink – every time someone drinks
1 drink – every time someone says “Anaconda” or you see the word “Anaconda”
NOOOOOOOOOO
I've got 1 idea for the B movie, but that's about it really.
6And give me the download link.
10thetrollside: thin ice buddy
lemme check and see if i have it here first
6...XD
Tyranico, I like the way you think.
8D
A: Scott Pilgrim B: Reefer Madness the Musical
10<3
You don't wanna know how TacoWiz was dealt with
I cant drink
sol
pick a musical
6Between that and the Boast Busters drinking game, we'll be wasted by the end of the night.
God bless Ontario with 19+ drinking age
and ill rape you with a spoon
I figure The Pagemaster would be great to make fun of
A: True Romance B: Killer Klowns From Outer Space
Ohh a musical then i would do fiddler on the roof top
there's a boast busters drinking game?
shit, i sent all my movies home when i moved out of my apartment
7Dari? Is there an easy way to do that?
dont have it here
That one I'd like to know about
...okay.jpg
There are no real A Musicals, none that do the original justice anyway :/ Maybe West Side Story
everytime she says the great and powerful?
6Every time Trixie refers to herself as The Great and Powerful Trixie you take a drink.
*: /
I suppose it's just 'if Great and Powerful Trixie is said, drink'?
Sathi: It's not that easy unless you already have the needed programs set up.
hm
Then it's easy.
Sprinkles said he can't use megavideo anyway.
17 deaths, infact..
7darn no script or anything? :)
8dari, we would all be dead of alcohol poisoning halfway through the movie if we did that XD
6If anypony else refers to her as The Great and Powerful Trixie, you take two drinks.
Everytime trixie pulls a smug face
Sol you talking to me
oh wait, that's erry time
That sounds like an awesome drinking game.
RBD you stocked up on alchohol for tonight?
que
Sprinkles, can you do requests?
6Likely, Lolipop.
6I'm getting set up still...
I'd play, but I don't like drinking by myself.
yay
10thetrollside I have some Hobgoblin, but most likely I won't be drinking buddy
; )
My bad, it was to Tyranico, but it's fitting to your comment too Sklar
6Can somepony... uh... download it via torrent and then put it on megaupload?
10got modding to do innit
6FAWK
I prefer drinking alone
Oh okay
too bad, drink anyway
innit mush.
>implying modding isn't just randomly kicking people for fun
Little Shop would be good too, were it not for the diabetic ending
Social drinking > drinking alone :P
