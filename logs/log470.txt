yup
Noted
Yeah but fireflies are a poor light source.
>java
hmmmmm
03well
03I dont'care about syntaxes
03it's the logic I need help with
03:/
03recursion is killing me
03I have everything else done
well
03:|
lol
03I haven't written it LOL
03but my teacher said it should only be 4 lines
._.
03I have like
03{
03	if (maze[x][y].getValue() == (mazeSize * mazeSize))
03	mazeTravel(x+1, y);
03	return false;
03}
real natural gas in its natural state is odorless. Nice of them to not use the rotten egg smell trope
she gona die
03but I dunno if that would actually help
boolean? oh right
03o.o
huzzah!
03well
inb4 she dies lol
00,10momo: lolnope
lol bugs
that momo
hahahah momo
LOL
03I figure that way I'd just do a while(!mazeTravel)
03or something
ewwwwwww
that katara
lol :D
ewwwwwwww
dat protein
03the other problem I see
03is printing it
03my maze looks like this
0313-14 15-EXIT
03|
039 -10 11-12
035 -6 7 -8
03S -2 -3 -4
03uh
he touch everything
03anyway
Find that egg!
eww week old egg :O
03the path should be like
03Start-2-3-4-8-7-11-15-Exit
lol.
03so thing with recursion
03if I have it print each time
bah
genius!
03it's gonna show it backing up?
03:/
huh, i heard this
07yes.
EGGZ are the solution
hm
oh no
fun fact
lol
we do this
NOOOOO :O
*GASP*
funner fact, we don't use real eggs
Why do I sense something evil in the works?
03yeah, it took me most of the day to get that stupid maze to work
03due to loop nesting
haha
I was just about to mention Xchat crashing Mint really badly
03but I finally got it xD
and then it crashed again
:D
woah freak much
Dunnnnnnnnn
Dun dun dun
uh oh.
lol loop nesting
dun dun duuun
/me 11,01fire nation
Oh, he does understand.
that's fun
weponz
ok
03want me to pastebin my code? :P
nah
03it reads in the file and works fine
I don't want to look at java
lol
03All I need now
03is for it to give me a solution
03to the maze
03XD
Ohlawd
lol
00,10I offered.........my arse
Do the konami
:p
uh
soon
|o|
Hmmm....
00,10times up
aang objection pose
murder
diing ding
:(
/me sneeses
03I already have that?
03	if (maze[x][y].getValue() == (mazeSize * mazeSize))
03the value is 16
Awwww
while (endroom == false):
03It just displays as EXIt when you print it
03:P
kill him! kill him now!
slap
0.0
air slap
Bitch slapped.
it exits the loop
and after the loop is a line that says "finished" or something
03does that qualify as recursion though?
Aang has mastered the long-distance bitch slap.
time 4 war
hello everypony
I'm assuming it does
11,01GG Avatar.
00,10I prefer if it were a french maid =p
03hm
cus' you're looping through the maze
03so that loop goes inside mazeTravel?
yeah
bye everyone! :D
03OK
inb4 aang was wrong
dat sound effect
03well I'll change it to void
lol
03and hm
pchtchctcht
lol I can't tolerate java
And this concept eluded you HOW?
/me 11,01balloons
slime?
stink bomb is best bomb
STINK
I just noticed
that my C++ code is 614 lines long
Why not frag and explosion bombs?

03basically like

Soowag
s/increasing/decreasing

Saturn: jam is delicious
And Jam is a sort of smooth preserves here.

/me feels the urge to ask Saturn about Tina Barret and Brian Blessed

I use to be the butter of the bread.
Also, in america, we pronounce "garage" as Guh-Rahj

lol
Mostly because she's very much the same as me in terms of the role we play with our friends.
lol
Saturn: Twilight
Saturn: would you believe the entire mane 6
I'm the most consistent and straightforward, and probably the most likely to be called "boring"
lol
08,01interesting
Saturn: I would say I'm most like Pinkie, cause I'm over energetic and I like a good laugh
Saturn: emotionally as in say their problems or things like that?
best kind of combination
my touchpad keeps dying
Saturn: Fluttershy, I am very shy in public and I am very good with animals
eat it!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
/me is noming on cookes
13ZEEEEEEHEHEHEHEEEEE
Saturn: I associate most with Twilight, due to me being bookish like she is, and also socially awkward, hehe :$
Congrats?
Hardware failure?
Saturn: Actually I'm more of a mix between several Ponies, I'm loyal like Rainbow, energetic like Pinkie, Kind like Fluttershy and Bipolar like Rarity

Saturn: not really, but I find myself doing that with every show

Saturn: were talking about why we like the show now

00,10fat is flavor
08,01though, you could say that violence is the basic vulgarity, common to us all
Saturn: i think i mispelled that...
lol
11,02FlareChaser: Awesome :D
08,01though you could say that about sex too...
lol
Saturn: yeah, i know, but its withing decent limits at least. the one thing i didnt like was the spiked drink joke

Saturn: I don't think a connection is necessary, but it helps immensly to enjoy the show.

Close Enough
At the end of the day the undeniable fact is that the show is just good. Really good. And good HAS no demographic. :)
08,01CupcakeWarrior: i don't really want to be
Switch to Android already.
Saturn: it makes sense to me. I can find something to relate with in every character of the mane 6

04Ah
04'Finer'

I thought you mean price.
04$1,000 for Earthbound?
04Sounds about right
o.o
EarthBound is pretty rare
04It's that good of a title
04And it's incredibly rare
04So couple its cult pheonemon status with excellent gameplay and rarity and you have quite an expensive title
Um, it's a lot more complicated than that.
04Then please
04Teach us
04Kandarihu

08,01(\
Saturn: oh noes
Saturn: iz ur prostate ok?

08,01aye

my favorite flavor.... EVIL~
Saturn: Stream a stream?
08,01XAX: the horror! the horror!

08,01Vordox: university and organising a convention
Saturn: D:
04Ohhhhh that
gta is awesome though
D:
what's an MTA?
^lol
multi theft auto, mulitplayer mod for gta, not sure whic one though
04GTA is awesome, but it's San Andreas
04Which came out in mid-'00's
04Actually, more like early 2000's
All the more playable, then.
it was closer to mid
042004
04So mid 2000's
<.<
pony based mmorpg
thats where the money is
04It's about if people would enjoy it
I suppose
04It's a bit different from GTA IV
wat
There's not much to do in MTA. Basically a deathmatch.
04GTA IV is more "realistic"
04But I think the Carmageddon mod for GTA IV is fucking awesome
....oh, got to go everypony.
04Truly a grand old time
carmageddon mod.......WHY DO I ONLY JUST KNOW ABOUT THIS
04Or is it "grand ole time"
Hope that you enjoy it!:)
04As in the top down GTA?
gta 1 and 2 are good games
04Ugh
04I just couldn't get into them
The only one that comes CLOSE to that BGM is...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4JvKl7nvL0 <--- The only song that ACTUALLY was good, and it lastedd for seconds ONLY, urgh
justice-waters of nazareth
That rhythm, bass, tunes....<3
Such awesome song
Exluding Radio songs, of course.
04Ah, good
04Because I was really going to beg to differ
And not rely on outer factures.
factions
factors...derp
04Ohhhhh
04No, I haven't
04But I have played the DLC
thats an eric prydz song
I have to say, my favorite RPG is Earthbound. It somehow introduced insta-battles where you can instantly kill lower-level enemies, which makes it less annoying. :P
Hey ya'll
Good*
Wanna help me find a word?

I heard it once, it's something like 'shishay' or something

Meh. I rarely use TPB anyway. I use isoHunt and the likes.
Anyway, as for ACTA, we still have Cispa to worry about, and something else, Think it was PIPA
Luna: wana play DD? :)
07,01sure
Innit always, though?
\o/ hello everypony!
I don't even like my current government. They're allegedly socialists, but they don't do a good job of anything.
Then again, Moderator did a TERRIBLE work. BUT do remember that there's factors to take in, World Economy for example caused the huge 15-20% Unemployment
moderaterna*

That's....sugary Saturn
Luna: ofc =3

Most of the fics in Equestria Daily don't interest me. :I
lol
04I keep hearing about a Kingdom Hearts HD collection
/me sleeps
04IF
04And only IF
I IZ GET NAO
04Because NA didn't get that shit
I'd buy that
04And I am disappoint in Japan

You are a Temo mod

NOW STREAM FOR US!
04There's quite a few KH HD collection images

04Huh

derp
04God of War HD Collection
That's called "Milking and making the series die out" :P
04Suuuuuuuuuure
04Because the MK Kollection a few years ago meant that MK9 was a total failure
04Oh wait
04It wasn't
08,01Spell-of-Gaming: it's because of type-coercion
08,01== is type coercive in JS
08,01which is why there is... sigh... ===
08,01PHP suffers the same problem
04Then you can't rightfully say that HD collections or any collections for that matter always justify the end of a series :P
08,01there is abolutely no reason ever for === to exist
:P
Saturn is smart:P
04I'm not saying they're good, I'm saying that there are more titles coming out in that series
04There's a difference between loss of identity and the end of a series
Hardly...
04Look
04Let me give you an example
04Silent Hill
04Never once had a collection series introduced to NA
04And yet it's STILL GOING
ugh. Why did I even bother reading up on a discussion about shipping. *sigh*
04The HD Collection
04Fuck
04See
Whhut?
Ther eis one?
04That's how you know things have gotten bad
i hate shipping
04(or that I've been up all night :D)
i hate shipping too
04Because the HD Collection was done baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadly
I've only played Homecoming.
04Homecoming is terrible
i played them all
04The worse in the series
I know.
14hello
hi
Dominooo
04I haven't
04However
04I honestly believe Fluttershy should have been the protagonist in the fanfic
O.o
As the hero?
04No
04As the protagonist
Saturn, actualy i disagree with you
Starring: fluttershy
04There's a bit of a difference between "hero" and "protagonist"
>_>
04Also
04As in the first one :P
/me flops on the... classroom desk?
The first one was great
14xD
14good thing is that I have nothing to do tomorrow
03DROP ON THE DECK AND FLOP LIKE A FISH
Protagonist means main character, while hero means... hero. Am I right? :P
14except a stupid poetry to memorize
14see you
Which part was that again?
04Hero typically implies that the main character can do no wrong, or is without flaw
I can see how it can get mixed up. Usually the main character does overcome something.
Oooh
[1] != [1] but [null] == [null] makes no sense
04Silent Hill 4 was The Room
It was good?
04(Not *that* Room, BTW)
I heard quite a few people saying it was bad
04Yes
04Very, very good
In comparrison or stand alone?
04The atmosphere was surreal and eerie
Never played it. I don't like horror.
04If you compare 4 to 3, then 3 wins in Gameplay
04*gameplay
04In fact
Why are there Clockwork Nurses in Homecoming?
04The nurses in Homecoming are based off of the nurses in the movie
Movie?
Hello :3
14how are you?
Sleeeeepy~ T-T
I liked 4
its more specified value cannot equal another specified value, but 'no value' must equal 'no value'
14aww x3
14same
x3
Yeah, I agree.
It was shocking. :(
04Definitely
04Still though
04I just don't like it anymore than 2, 3, or 4
I know
I'm watching it from a storytelling view. :)
Not from a "Game per game" basis
04See
04Was that it was just one humongus mind fuck
Luna, you there?
07,01i'm here
04No
04Well
Luna, skype
04Maybe
A different aspect, we can say
04Or borrow it
04Don't buy it until you've seen it
04Because it was pretty bad
Is it based on any of the games, or is it it's own tangent?
Own tangent, I think
04It takes a lot from the previous games
Loosely followed.
04The entire soundtrack is comprised from songs in the games
04But uh
14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxBSYit49c8&feature=youtu.be
14o.o
Sega Toylet
;p
The only thing pissing me off about that movie, is Cybil. :P
04Bleh
04They turned Cybil into something not Cybil
Agreed.
not to mention her part of the story at the end. ._.
THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING.
04But at least it somewhat follows canon
04I mean
04She does...well...
Well yeah, it WAS A choice, if I remember.
04*Spoilers*
04So I can't say
Yeah I know
04But the official canon for Cybil is ultimately followed through in the film
O.o
It was the OFFICIAL CANON!`?
Pyramid head was introduced in SH2, yeah?
04No no
04@Scarlet: Yes
04Anyways, the ultimate fate of Cybil is followed through
04...I'll just say it
14wb
...
THAT IS F*CKING BAD
She was my FAVOURITE!
>=(
%"#/%)=(&/!(/%=)/!)(!!!!!
04:<
Even too much canon exists
04Yes
04There's another film coming out
04It's in development...maybe post now
04Follows Heather Mason and her father, Harry
04Now
04Mind you
04It's the same continuity from the first film
Let's just hope the story is decent this time.
:I
04I mean
04Holy shit
12hihi
04And yet
04According to the second film
04Who is now Harry
WRITERS
04Bleh
04Fucking fuck
04It's confusing
Cyyyyybiiiiiiiil! *Gushes tears*
12!pokemon
04But
04They're not in the real world
04So
04How in the world
Oh guys....Silent Hill stories ARE f'cking hard to follow. :P
Just like Homestuck. FUCKING TIME TRAVEL SHIT.
They both used the "Clear Skies" shout.
04And I can't help but the crew spoiled a very important tidbit of info
04Chris *is* Harry Mason
04....wut?
04Really guys?
lolwuut
04You're just gonna let that shit go?
HAAALLLOOOYWOOOUUUUD
04You're just gonna put it out there like that?
Writers, did you get inspiration from Homestuck? :I
04You couldn't at least have had some kind of neat twist?
At least it's the other way around, or else. TROPETV TO THE RESCUE
Sometimes, liscensed games are just bad.
O:
AlAlicorn
I HAD HUGE VOLUME ON
4game.
Thank you for NOT scaring me, but making the FULL FUCKING HOUSE hear it when I had my Stereoes in...
suddenly stream
hmmm, we must be the backup
The only one I find interesting
on the'
is there a stream?
100!
Yes
down to 98
04The hermit woman?
The woman that lived outside the church
04Oh, you mean Anna?
HOLEY SHIT HE TORE HER SKIN OFF LIKE IT WAS CLOTHES
04^
04Yeah
04I don't think you'll be seeing Anna again :I
Dat stream
there we go
04Scarlet...already did
You have HIGH education and IQ
Think
but, i have a few questions.
04Main?
Harry yes
04Ah
Pyramidhead was in SH2, not 1
The movie has a female main.
04Right
04Ohhhhhh, are you asking why Pyramid Head was in the movie?
04Because
04Fan service
lol
*cough*
04There was zero reason for Pyramid Head to be in the movie
04He's an executioner that punishes people
I commented on drf's profile
04They're not flawed characters
EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE IT!
lol no
14o.o
buthi
butthi
but hi
ffs
14butthi
stuf
stuf
stfu
can't type today
LOL butthi
14xD
I think the appearance of Pyramid Head in the movie was purely fanservice
04And I hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE his design in the film
I hate how the sudden fanservice. :I
04Ever since then he's become the subject of every yaoi fangirl's dream
....
WHY NOT
hiii
byee
*love
Nono, I mean WHY Pyramid head EXISTS cause of Harry
(Game wise was it then?)
no u
04Pyramid Head doesn't exist for any one character
link it
>phone
I think he did, I remember it being explained somewhere and I got pissed and stopped reading. ><
http://www.lugia.us/forum/profile/drfsupercenter/
Thanks
:O
That's all I wanted to know
08,01<3
you can link by profile name?
It was something like "Harry" or "James" had some issues of consciences that MADE PH to be existing?
that's the link I got...
...
where the fri=k
*c
did you get that
That's terrifying..
that's about as good as the show itself
:P
Well, it was explained at that time. Not the following and merely got retconned or something.

I find everything wrong with it
How so>

?*
I think that's enough hate for today drf ):
none of those people are me
04Then get it for the PS2 instead, the HD collection is riddled with bugs and glaring graphical inconsistencies
I would have to be really high to find talking colored horses amusing
woah
drffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

someone did that actualy

got it to use the dvd calls instead of the normal ones
Why did I instantly think that was Saturn? no idea.
Apple is really idiotic to know a jailbroken iOS.
hurr
>If he jailbroke it, they deny the service.
>If you say no, even if you jailbreak it, they'll repair it anyway.
i havent seen a Saturn stream in a while :(
also, mfw greeted in #bronystate
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4516/
This is h4x :3
lol those tags
We need a Saturn stream once a while. :P
lol. batteries
homebrew?
mfw Chocolate Buttons in the pantry
MFW they put iOS devices in
its always Korea.
'the ps3 security system is strong' his face when he was in the ps3 hack talk
They can hack a console, they can't push a button, WHERE IS THE WORLD GOING TO!?
Hello LunaLookin
which i streamed a while ago
I laugh at those :P
And Android.
and uncles.
the homebrew channel is an excelent bit of software
and every console should have a vendor suported version to allow user code
hi
Hm?
WhY aren't you guys LEARNING?
<.<
and the ps3 one was more limited than it needed to be
The hakcers.
Hackers?!
0-0
hardware hackers
When did dat happen?
this was from 2008
Even after proving it over and over and over again
when they hacked the Wii
A simple "I want to add this background" causes hug gaps into the gaming society ><
hey guys
now I can't stay to visit the highschool with the rest of my book club :(
hackers are not a market they target, which is a little silly
This is the same thing, happening over and over again
is there a stream going on
Crap! Bus COME BACK!
and thus it was hacked
several times
less likley to brick
default bootloader bricked ~1% of consoles on one or two of the system updates
Do you think they just finally gave up on fixing all the bugs and released it, due to pressure of producers?
Stream just buffered for meh
yeah, i'm not streaming anything right now
have some music
04It's been sooooooooo long
04Whoa, whoa, whoa
04>FCW
04More than likely a smark
Quiet day in the prison camp today is it not?
I'm more casual, but I folow.
follow^
04You know FCW
I do.
I also know OVW, and I've been to some ROH events.
04Oh?
Stream is down? D:
04Then I wouldn't really call you a casual :P
/me likes this song
Oh, playing song, dang
Nothing, I just found a great song. =3 That I wanted to share
actually, the day before a RAW was there.
Dream Evil: The Chosen Ones.
No stream, or did mine derp? :P
04Never heard of JCP, though it does sound familiar...
Ello there everypony.
no.
the predecessor to WCW.
04OHHHHH
04Jim Crocket
04The territory
yeah.
dat South Ohio.
No stream, I see?
:P
04No wrong time to get into wrestling
04Plenty of things to look at in the past
04For when you have a shit present product
I was in-and-out. I watched WCW and ECW when I was younger, after the buyouts, I kinda dropped off.
04Yep?
04Define "real"
04Some of the punches can be real
real enough for injury, not real fights.
04But that's called
04"being stiff"
04When you actually connect attacks
04The injuries are real (typically, unless it's part of an angle)
04But the animosity or whatever? The "hate" between one wrestler and another is purely for show
04Or rather scripted
04The feuds are scripted
04Well that's called "no selling" if they don't react to getting "hurt"
Hogan is famous for it.
04So is Warrior
so's undertaker
04Actually
04I'd consider "no selling" to be a part of Taker's gimmick
04He "rises from the dead" after seemingly getting hit with a particularly "devestating maneuver"
although, Warrior is more famous for being nuts.
yep.
NO STREAM? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qLlyqR19gU
Good day everypony :P
04You don't watch to see two men fight, if you want to see a real fight then watch boxing or UFC
remember, "wrestling" is theater.
I was at Bellator 2.
Heyall :)
04But yes, pro wrestling is theatrical
04It's a play, of sorts
04Well that's why pro wrestling is typically faster
04In real fights it's meticulous
04The action is slow paced, because acting too fast means that you're going to make a mistake and get punished for it
yeah.
04That's a real fight in boxing or UFC
04Especially boxing
04But in wrestling it's all choreographed
To about 60% yes
And all the talk is BS
In wrestling that is
its entertaining, though.
04Haha
04Nah
its also entertaining when they botch.
04Sorry
04Go watch TNA if you want just random spouts of violence
04That place is a fucking mess
But to much comersals for my taste
04At least they got Russo out of there
04God
well, cou could also watch these two fight. a lot more entertaining than wrestling, if you ask me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwNVQvygCNQ
04YES
04All the time
04I was about to say that you have a point, that botches can be *hilarious*
Japan is crazy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deC2uxu0XA4 :P
04Especially if you know the context behind a certain botch
right.
04But sometimes botches can be really dangerous
04Sometimes they end up getting actually hurt
dont forget Brawl for All.
04What was Brawl for All?
that was the reason why I didnt watch attitude-era WWE.
WWF, whatever.
04Ah
04Those
Russo!
04WWF doesn't promote those anymore
04Er
04WWE, rather
04Poor bastard
that man was AWESOME.
yeah, sadly.
04Yeah
04Eh
04Maybe
he survived cancer, then it came back.
04But I don't really laugh at wrestlers dying
throat cancer at that.
04I'm 24 now
23 though.
04If you want pure entertainment, go WWE
04If you want...whatever the fuck TNA is, go TNA
04If you want pure wrestling, legitimate wrestling, go ROH
04If you want referential self humor and wrestling that doesn't take itself too seriously, go CHIKARA
;o
hi
I'm actually suprised to hear that Vocaloid concerts have singers backstage, which is really cool.
04Because there's nothing like selling an invisible hand grenade
hahaha.
04And they actually *slow down time, including the commentators*
04Everybody goes and talks in slow motion once the grenade is tossed
04I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did
I was just dropping by, I should be working, bai

Right.
