cult leader fluttershy

Do you think the break up changed him?
But he's told me he's nothing like that IRL
I'm not sure, I've only seen him once since he told me it happened
xenos kinda lack personality

Link to DarkSpyro?
I hate when people complain the forum isn't active and then don't do anything to make it more active
delicious
Is there anything we can do? Other than spamming links all over the place
Like I said, just post
Good afternoon everypony :)
We all still alive? :D
people don't post because they think it's not active
and it's not active because no one posts
oh]
:o
I don't post anything cuz I don't really have anything worth posting
well then you should actually take a look at darkspyro
and see if everything people post there is worth posting
good point
*if
<.<
if you want to go to darkspyro I'm not going to stop you lol
nah I'd rather stay on spyroforum

Today was the first Day in my Live that I played the old Tetris for the Gameboy in Multiplay against someone... and I destroyed him!
I'm on diff computer

Must be bad luck brian.

Meth I'm gonna make a post about all the spyro fangames I know of, you want me to add yours to the list?
Yes
and not just vapourware and talk.
Hey
There's Blako's, that definitely exists
What's that supposed to mean SR?
Hey Neotyguy
lol
'ones that are not just talk.
Like Mine^
Lets see yours then.
as far as I know it doesn't exist.
/me picks up his cat and hugs him, reducing his rage level
That mine is just talk for now
Does it have a name yet Meth?

hello
ok

ikr :3
Hai guys ;)
No that's for Mare-Do_well
I sit here all day every day
And refresh EQD
Is their a reason why were watching the same clips go over and over again? Not that I don't like it or anything.
afternoon everyone
How's it going, TheGreatAnPowerfulT?
yup
Spyro 4
I actually thought I would die today a few years ago.
"Many hot dogs are within you"
"Try Pepto!"
....this conversation is turning strange
I just saw the commercial right now, it's halarious.
ooo one of my favorite artists is doing a Q&A stream
^
ok....
getter
add on if you like
RUnning man
and Battery is not included
I've never seen Running Man. Is it good?
Arney's always good
its with Arnold Schwarzenegger
Wanna join mine?
Cause I am working on 2 projects. Spyro 4 and The Only Easy Day
>religion
>make sense
yeah I'll flip between the two
Sure, what's involved?
Commando was awesome
Makes more sense than worshipping a cartoon.
Can you learn UnrealScript and Lua?
The Only Easy Day is on UDK. Spyro 4 is on CryENGINE 3
Anybody know the name of the movie with Coach Carter? I'm watching it right now, it's bomb.
there is a mitten religion. fact
3D games?
The movie's called Coach Carter
Awesome sports movie
i am watching back to the future 2
ACHDHBSLIDF
yup
Sorry, my computer just screwed up, let me rephrase
And in the UK
there is a jedi religion?
Well, a lot of people claim to be Jedi
You may want to find someone else then, I'm not good with 3D vector math
The jedi religion was created due to a way that Britian registers religions
cheddar
WAT
you have failed :I
D:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Does anyone really think George Lucas is cleaver enough to invent a religion?
;~; i suck
No, he really isn't
yes
it IS
I'm good with lower level programming like C/C++ and Java
Hey everyone~
UnrealScript is like Java.
Lua is exactly like C++, Except some Style diffrences
I've used Lua
Never seen UnrealScript before though
derpy: wait why didn't it taste like speghetti?
oh
Because it was spaguetti duhh
I can do 2D vector math, collision handling, event handling, and module style games
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript
oh
Why not learn now?
Celestia got her flank handed to her
She was probably battling the Changelings while Celestia was "Dead"
Celestia's kind of 3-0 right now
3-0 terms of losing?
Please refer to this: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-slender-mane.html
Mostly because larger games typically have many people working on it
nopony beats me http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Mysterious-Muffin-Mercenary-Mare-317953866
Does Celestia do ANYTHING to fucking help?
yessss....NO
She sends encouraging letters
She always sends Twillight and friends to do her job
that were already written.....
Well...can celestia work the stairs?
Well the problem I have is she's a fucking GODDESS
We have 19 people working on it
Its pathetic
Not yet a queen
really? I never knew it was that much
Because queens are "evil"
there is no queens in equestria
why is that?
I could kick celestia's arse any day
Luna could handle it
you're working on 2 games?
Teah
Yeah
function int example_function (int example_number) { example_number = 5; return example_number; }
:P
Also I still hate that Celestia still hasnt fucking apologized for doubting Twilight
http://mibpaste.com/ACAENq
That is Hello World with Unreal Script^
The fuck celestia
Well she does take a special interest in Twilight
Maybe Celestia likes Vampires :O
Twilight can turn animals to oranges
derpy : yes shes dangerius that way
hi how is everyone
Also why the fuck did Celestia completly ignore the whole brooch?
brooch>
3rd person tactical shooter like SOCOM
*?
froggy bottom bog
That makes it more difficult
saw the hobit yesterday :D
the locomotive is the train
Why do I still type Twixie, I know it is Trixie
I actually type in lisp
HAI
ihate my keyboard
Not for public display!
How many programmers you got?
2
2 out of 19
yup
That's not incredibly bad
I design
Regardless
1 designer?
It should have taken more than one little argument to set the bastard free
But yeah, maybe Celestia should have moved the statue
You may want to find more designers, at least for level design
or cracked it or something
Maybe Celestia wanted to show off her statue.
We have 3 level designers
Can we just say Celestia is a moron?
Hey, Celestia's just like us!
Well her track record is horrible
First of all sending twilight 2 tickets for 5 friends
Celestia real name is Trolestia
Which are immune to magic for the most part
Good thinking there Dumblestia
derpy: That was only on a few instances.
Her tests are bullshit
:p
Well, if you have some sort of repository, I can look at that
When has celestia hiden something really well.... She put me in a snowglobe that doesnt count
Repository?
You guys don't use a repository?
Git? SVN?
All Foals Day?
DropBox
I might switch us up to SVN. I need to set one up though
and they forgot it 6_9
Maybe they were just like >if it ever shows up again we can send the intern to deal with it
And they give off a nice light show
she's still in hte opening, but that's it
Feed me!
FEED ME
