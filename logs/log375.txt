Now to enjoy this episode for 2 weeeks.
I BLEW IT D=
Pinkie technically succeeded in converting him in the end, even if he's still an introvert
If the itunes versions where 1080p and not infested with drm I would happily buy them

It says I can download multiplayer but I don't know if you have to buy MW3
It's been a rough weekend.

Never ever fucking break a Pinkie Promise
Which was?
Oh

You shouldn't make a promise unless you're willing to die to keep it
I loved the reveal at the end of that episode
that's why it's a promise
07,013 march if i'm not mistaken
I mainly watched the episode for Derpy
Pinkie's … damn, no spoilers
/me wonders why it aint working
Nuuuuuu!
its simple using punnet squares
I cared about Applejack
Oh, well, more time for Fanfic.
racist?
Lol,how
Really hard
Everyone's a little bit racist :D
I'll be off for a while, toodles everypony
I'm pretty sure Twilight is a perfectionist

The twilight episode looks interesting as well
08,018,1hey guys
But it was soooo good
I didn't expect much from SSCS6K, but it's one of my favorites now
The best episode was last round up
When is the spike episode

I thought Last Roundup was kinda downhill after Derpy
10,02See you all at BMN!
Nice music
Last Roundup had a moral that hit close to home.
I'VE BEEN SPOILED BY HOW AWESOME PONIES ARE, OKAY?
Yeah, great moral
darn, I forgot to spam "grond"

I'm still perplexed that I, a 90s kid, has never heard of this show.
IMDB says the movie is coming out in 2014.
I watched everything, Even Matlock and Rockford Files.
it was dazzling :P
DAZZLING! ;)
not really, working
also, today's Derpy spotting was the most bizarre.
but occasionally
ya dat derpy XD
how did she ever get into there !
only Derpy knows
"THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!"
oh don't worry, i was just asking
sorry everypony
07,01Sean Connery is awesome
08,01episode... was AWESOME
*wub face*

08,01CountDoofus: i did not
How long is this
huh. never mind me then
oriental riff
The narration for this cartoon remains quality.
08,01bmn is in an hour
08,01oh, yeah, maybe
08,01i'm not sure
08,01i'm not usually awake then
08,01let's go with "yes"
regardless of the fact I most certainly could sink the money
I think I vaguely remember this show existing, but I never watched it.
I don't even remembering this show existing
Or maybe I'm thinking of something else
I don't even know
too busy watching Rescue Rangers
if you are going to use it, and you do have the money, i don't really see the problem, as long as you make that inversion worth the money
08,01woah, lots of channel noise
08,01
Hmm, Pinkie pie has moved up to RARITY TIER, with rarity
I dont get it
Animal androids… don't let Jack run rampant here.
those animal droids makes derpy look like brain surgeon
OR… Dr. Robotnik's been busy winning.
those girls sound stupid
poor 4th wall
but.. derpy is a brain surgeon!
???

Saturn: DERPY! it's DERPY
She's that to, but I meant scumbad.
this is the episode where pinkie pie changed from stupid annoying pest to maybe not totally unbearable for me
2,14 of course, even if it wasn't, I'd still agree <.< >.>
oh
wait
spike already broke the fourth wall
05,15Bronystate mascot is Indian Stallone
that assfuck friend of dashie's
Saturn: Derpy!
08,01RAWRity: yes. yes, we are.
that beotch
Pinkie is best inventor
The thing that bugs me most, is that despite the fact that Trixie is a complete and utter douchebag, people still like her. That is beyond stupid.
no
NO
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

I have never done an illegal drug... I'm not even sure how you could even have intercourse with an illegal drug... Consumed on the other hand... :D
Man she is such a bitch

08,01have any of you ever been to India?
Saturn: eenope
08,01seriously, everyone dances. all the time. exactly like this.
Saturn says its terribad

Saturn: I KNEW IT!
Saturn: lol
Falls onto tracks! :O
i like trains.......
I can't speak random.
never been there...friend said everyone is poor and racist
Saturn: they have to find some way to tolerate the widespread, awful poverty.
And then he was train
http://derpy.me/IjNB9
Wow 1.9/10
I have never seen this movie
I met an indian, not to be rude, but his fragrance was unsettling, but that was the spices
he's a hustler
08,01it is
Saturn: no.
00,03I here India is quite rainy this summer...
Indians Ftw.
oh no...
No, that would be trixie bad
how do you pm?
I see Indians at my job every day. they're nice people, just their odors could use some improvement
seems safe
THIS part
08,01that's why indians smell
but as said, most of that is because of the spices they frequent
Luna: because of you, i have a fondness for bollywood
Saturn: the more we know.
my eyes!
07,01great :)
Saturn: The More You Know
Saturn: THATS why they always smelled like that!
00,03I never knew that!
mmmmm
Wow, an indian chav??
08,01Sheepy: ha!
Bunty Aur Babli
suddenly hot chick
aur means and?
08,01Sheepy: you've never been to bradford...
Is it going to freeze on that wonderful meme again?
oh, I thought it was they use frankencinse
and, maybe?
Luna: has anyone told you about the meme that spawned from this film last night?
is the whole movie a musical?
07,01yep
07,01I heard it was lagtastic last night
A resteront there
13saturn! i need you!
http://derpy.me/JtiaC
00,03It all worked out in the end, Luna!
Luna: you have nO idea, a meme was born last night
Luna: http://i.imgur.com/MESBm.jpg
Luna: Indian Stallone
Luna: yeh, i stopped on a derp face when subtitles were being fixed
Not... exactly. It's really a hiest flick-- with musical numbers thrown in at apparently random intervals.
10,02Oh yeah, I'll PM you the link to it.
I'm outta here let ne know when this is over
this goes on for too long
00,03Hope you have 3 hours to kill!
Yeah, 170min long this film is
08,01RAWRity: i can see it, but my brain just says "no"
3 hours is pretty average for a Bollywood film
Isure was.
10,02I'm always online O___O
08,01though i've been with an indian woman once, and that was... interesting
3 hours? Screw that, I'm leaving.
00,03In akk honesty, I like this film! It gives you a sense of culture :3
08,01brain said "that skin is the correct colour"
10,02But school takes up all of my time it seems :/
00,03all*
Hey wait! is this a musical!?
IS there even a plot to this movie?
07,01good :)
Yup an indian chav on a moped
O.O whats this movie about?
2 1/2 hours of ancing, 10 minutes of film, 20 minutes of credits.
good luck
Yeah, there is a plot. >_>
Give me any kind of woman to be honest, black/white/asian/indian I'm not particualry picky they are ALL attractive in their own way
dancing*
<--- *puts on his determined face*
08,01Sheepy: all indians ride mopeds
i think its an hour of signing
non-stop
2 1/2 of singing.
but there not all chav's
0,14see, this movie made me realize
singing*
It's kind of not really about anything-- it's pure, unadulterated escapism.
firggin catchy indian song
Movie over
08,01SuperBrony64: it's india, half the peeople on the train don't have permission to be there.
This movie is about aliens that integrate themselves into humanity with song.
wut
I gotta' go to work. You guys have fun, heh.
Yes, Saxy, yes we do
10,02Saturn: O U
I am pretty sure India is nothing like this

08,01Meanwhile: unfortunately not; my mum's from a place where they speak Telugu, but this is in Hindi
08,01and she never tuaght me and my brother properly
Bummer, I was wondering if the subtitles were accurate.

Cya.
08,01i know how to say some rude words, thouhg
India has a bunch of languages spoken all around the country
Saturn always first learn the rude words x3
08,01the sole purpose of which was to stop my aunties calling me
Saturn: that's the best part of knowing other languages.

08,01okay, lemme explain the indian head dot
hmm. Now I want to try indian train tea...
That loading screen o.o
08,01it's called a Bindi in the north and a Butti in the south
00,03Isnt it like a gateway to peace or something, Saturn?
08,01in the north, only married women wear it, as an auspicious symbol of good luck in marriage
11,01It's not a head dot, it's a laser pointer from a sniper rifle.
That load screen
08,01in the south, girls wear it too
00,03Nittany O U
I only have an alt acount with the hurricanepansyplz animated icon... They're... humping
Huh. crappy window repair there...
08,01so if you see an unmarried girl wearing one, you know she's from the south
08,01anyhoos, it's meant to bring prosperity and status
didn't know that
It's a KFC store.
08,01gues don't generally wear them
interesting
Saturn: is it considered in bad taste if you tell a woman you like their Butti?
08,01*guys

08,01CountDoofus: well, i was a furry in the 90s, when it was a very very different place
08,01kinda awesome
There are furries and there are furries. It all depends.
but then it went rule 34 all over the place?
08,01y'know, frak that

It's sorta on that route in my opinion
Drama? I don't think I wanna know, do I? XD
11,01I like the fandom.
This is why I am sometimes vocal about my disdain for r34 and the like
Drama happens
I think I come off as self-rightious, but I just don't want the community to go that direction
I like this fandom too, even though there are some minor things I don't like about it
11,01It needs to stay a force of good and not devolve into a crazy religion or a civil-warring fandom.
rather not discuss it
ok~
People told him no but did he listen
Saturn: I don't know, I was in the fandom back in the nineties, too. It is hard to see objectively, but looking back I tend to think people were less nice than I gave them credit for at the time
dat face
Anyone know of a good fanfic? I feel like reading one.
Ofc not. and he was incinerated.

(\
Once upon a time, it was radio and movies that were rotting people's brains.
11,01Boop.
Another thing I noticed about furries was that the fandom at one point became paranoid about public opinion to the point that people got shitstormed for linking furry sites on other websites
And before that, they tried to control books and printing strictly.
11,01Sorry, that was on my end with my Cat sitting on my keyboard.
Rare: I once got banned from a channel because I wouldn't join in in the furry hate. =D

And also, Anime has less random acts of musical numbers.
Saturn It's very simple, Indian culture hasnt hit in America, because of the difference in culture
