How to be intelligent: When the HAM operator (not me) tells you to "Get the <expletive> off my router." It's a good idea to listen. :P

07more like a lazy poster doesn't want to participate D:
lol
12i do want to participate
12trust me i do, but the condition of the rp just makes it hard right now
07and that condition would be....what?
12needs more action and less talk D:
ACTION
There you go.
07plus
07they didn't even know they were heading into a battle when they left the cave
12where is everyone right now?
03dead.
03I killed them all.
12as much as i could read they are still away from the village overlooking the village
07no
07they couldn't see the village from the cave
12but they can see the smoke
12from over the mountain
07when they got close
12sigh
07they're nowhere near the cave anymore
12glacy is still by the cave
12-.-
12that makes things just dandy
12hey surgery is painful D:
12you try to roleplay when you want to just.... knock yourself into a coma for the next couple of weeks
12sigh
07it's not impossible to string together half a paragraph when you just had teeth pulled
12for me it apparently is
07considering I had essays to do in school when I had my 4 taken out
12people are different
12some can multitask, some have difficulty doing just one thing
07and you'd be more in the loop if you had him participate and actually say words
12i can't agree more
12what about now?
12give me a couple
12to reread everything
07and just face Tomai instead of Velimoth or Dyan
o...k?
12there needs to be like a list of the villians
07but i didn't add him in yet
07he is in the signup thread though
12all those pages x-x
07well just ask questions instead of trying to figure everything out
12who is Tomai then
12ok
12sigh this is really breaking glacymr's style lol
12i still don't follow where everyone is
12ok
07the group is about a mile from town
07so they can see it now
12gotit
12sigh i should of known this would be a challenge for me
/me stares back
04I'm doing HW

12Yeh whats the prob..?
D:
i'm not ignoreing you Kipi
He's being a baby.
How are you?
my guess..everything?
He starts crying randomly, and whn I try to poke him to find out what's wrong, he refuses to talk and crawls into a corner of self-misery

14Ah.
exactly, he should say something then
I think he's upset that he's dropping out, but it was his choice. -.-
12Attention seeking due to sadness/depression etc.
yes
12Best thing to do is actually to tell him you're there for him if he ever comes to you about it
12and then leave him to it
12That usually snaps someone out of their senses
12If they need you that badly, they'll go to you
I guess

I've been hearing a lot about the 3D TVs lately.
because I put my polaroid pics as snapshot it puts them in scraps >.>
oh ^_^;
anyway right now 3D TVs are not worth it.
yeah like HD, wait for it to come down
that's just a premium though, give it a few months, maybe years, and they'll stop charging for something that costs nothing more to add
also there is not that much media or software etc that's specified for 3D TVs still
Yes?
No idea
How are you?
I'm alright
you?
like bundled etc
07lol
/me slaps Evil_Doer with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout

Good.
Really good.
That's good
really good
I've noticed I really like watching reviews...
of games?
Anything...
I do too
Have you ever heard of Redlettermedia?
wb Quan
however I cant remember if there was any noticable difference ^_^;;
Me too
That one was awful
:P
Grievous actually did something.
Eh, I never cared for it
But then again, I didn't watch it much either'
Maybe...
the 3D effect from that movie was a joke. especially with the cheap cardboard glasses with the sheet of plastic for the lens.
/me is dozing off a little
put them together and unintended naps can become a result
wb Ecco!
ty Nick!
It's weird.
That is weird
Me too, sometimes I may take four hour naps, wakeing up three or more times.

...there's families in it!
I dislike that kind of movie
Though there are few that I've seen
Virtually meaningless horro flicks, really.
*horror
yeah
I enjoy horror, but not like that.
It's hard for me to enjoy any entertainment that's meaningless
should be hard with anyone with sense.
But a lot of horror is intriguing.

Awake somewhere else, or awake as we know it is sleep?

/me 2slaps herself once
Hm.
Hadn't thought of that.
The former is like pure Fight Club

How did I make that mistake?
*facepalms*
you had to know something was up, though, when everyone's faces are conveniently hidden until the end.
yeah
But I didn't expect them to be that creepy
They reminded me of gargoyles.
Oh yeah
they kind of did look like that
Only assymterical as can be.
*asymmetrical
But yeah, good episode.
Did you see the
Chameleon one?
Hmmm
Hmm
Yeah
I think I've seen it
Wait, how about the really old one where the "female" computer tries to sabotage some guy's relationship because it loves him?

Speaking of music
Have you ever heard Minstrel's Song by Cartel?
=3
ummm I do know cartel and I have one of their albums but I haven't listened to it yet lemme see if it's the on my album
Oh wait
Minstrel's Prayer
not Song
It's from their first album I think
I heard it on a friend's CD
now I want to buy the CD
but I can't really afford music right now
torrent :P
unless we had one of those stores like you do by you
Nuh-uh
then buy it later
no torrent for me
:P
dude why hahaha
if you're gonna buy it later I don't see why not :P
but it still kind of feels wrong I guess
eh the guilt leaves after a few times
well see you gotta go to the right places I always go to btjunkie and I get the ones that say "VERIFIED BY # COMMUNITY REPORTS"
:P
lol yeah
:P
no it can't...it's not in the description it's on the site piece
oh
gosh
XD
could have had a V8
somehow
o__o
Woah
That's crazy
I KNOW RIGHT :D
I even scratched at it a bit on the booklet it's def. real
Isn't fye a retail store too?
Hmm maybe
I don't know the difference between stores all I know is that it's a store that sells CDs :P
lol
Well they aren't used though, right?
but it'd be marked if it was used
oh okay
I think there is a fye around here somewhere
you ever seen that movie?
Doesn't sound familiar actually

showerbrbo3o

it had a bit of everything in it
have you seen anything recently that was good in theatres??
I wanna go see macgruber next I think
Eh, I don't think that looks very good to be honest'
and before that it was Zombieland
that's the one with whatshisfacewhycantirememberhisname right??
and yes
did you ever see Year One?
No
That was a great one
eh
on all the reviews I saw it seemed to me like people thought it was going to be do[censored]entary-ish
like
people said it wasn't accurate
but that's not the point, people!!! :\
XD it isn't supposed to be
exactly
I thought it was great
and I'm not even really a movie person
and some comedies
bnut very few
*but
mehh I like to laugh ahha
That's the animated one, right?
I've seen that

I'm growing a beard

Actually
if you gave shadowrend up, you are cruel
I did the Aylied statue quest first
Actually had a semi-attractive girl checking me out today at the restaurant, sooooo
then you get a crown
Then Sheogorath's
hahahahah
I should've thought of this sooner
2 if you did a special trick
Then the Brotherhood
did you do the speical trick in the alyied quest?
lmfao
you can have 2 crowns for the price of one
there is another crown in a nearby ruin
*imperial city wise that is*
which you can give him it
and he dies :D
then you get both crowns
and show them off how ever you like
but yeah I advise thives guild if you want a challenge
Arena it is.

I don't wear either
I go... topless. :o

Morrowind doesnt habe the realm of madness
04ah
It could, Brother.
If someone made a mod for it
espically mannimarco >>
04really?
I'd agree with that
(which has alot of these little things to get extra goodies)
like Hermanus Mora
04well
04I don't have a 360

there should be 8-9 city guards in each city
then theres about 20-30 imperial city guards (including guards to the elder council)
k, I'll try that
he has one about a bicycle too
then we suppose there are 4-5 people in each guild hall
can't remember it
then about 15 residents in each city including the beggers
then the random followings
There was one time where I wiped out the entire towns of Bravil, Leyawin, and the Imperial city- including the dukes.
*16
Excluding immortal characters.
:P
maybe 170 people?
That's it?
which is ironic
it's suppose to be the heart of the empire
I was thinking more like 250+
well I' talking about how many that you can kill
without expansions of course
Oh, right
Silly me
:3
But even then
depending on wether you are a good fighter
How 'bout the settlements?
or you suck
I knew I should never had trusted him
for anything
ncluding
*have
settlements have a rareity to have 1 person or less
aka kvatch thing
/me yays
hehe
now
but the city but the 'settlement' north of it
02he used it on me before as well
kb plz
02I got pissed off
02lol
Kvatch has more than that. XP
ns
and if I dont including the necromancers spread through-out cyrodill
I mean the settlement up north
on a jerk
/me wants my vhost to be accepted :D
he's pissed off a lot of people
I sum up about 170
about 190
*maybe
Can you look it up? owo
hey RP4L we were just talking about games :P
Kipi: do you want to keep track of those you kill?
and how many people you can purge from it
5Huh. I have... never heard of that LOL.
I assume about 170-90 in total you could kill or do die
never heard Elder Scrolls?
it had its own moment in 2007-8
5N-no.

I'm on 20 channels, across 3 networks. I have 2 olines, 1 owners, 4 admins, 6 ops, 1 halfops, and 4 voices. I have the powers to help 49 people. I don't abuse son.
superior, abusive power is fail
lmao
Espeon
!espeon
I'm on 30 channels, across 8 networks. I have no olines, 1 ownership, 3 admins, 3 ops, and there's no way I'm manually counting the rest
Espeon would never do that
12o-O
I also know a network I have an oline on
I own him
Therefore I can make him do that.

Interesting fact: in Singapore expressways are given three-letter acronyms
12their menu has 113 items
... PFFFFFFFFFT LOL
There are these particular two, Bukit Timah Expressway and Pan-Island Expressway
That are abbreviated BKE and PIE
LOL
And they are connected to each other.
BKE PIE.
Bake pie!
12maybe like 60-70?
is there a SEX expressway? that would be obnoxious
Unfortunately... no.
it's a sign also

Usually they should take back the menus
Once you finished ordering
At least that's the norm here
12they have copies
Infinite copies?

12they probably are just trying to advertise
They are going to bankrupt themselves printing menus

02Flying fish lol
i would guess
Not right now, but my brother and sister are in the next room :P
me2?
But my brother reminded them
LOL no
XD
without the 360
ha
Plus my parents would never approve of anything M-rated
They don't care if I play it
12Yeh but you'd still be paying a stupid amoutn of monehy
But they don't want my younger brother and sister seeing it
But the truth is most of them aren't.
03yeah
03but less
03and it's my parents money anyway XD
I don't care about stories in most games
12I was gonna start driving right..
Unless they're actually /trying/ to have a cool unique story
*coughTLOS*
:P
03and
lol
/me dies
yes
yes they can
03o.
03*o.o
03my driver's ed was just a one time fee
12So I thought I'd be a cheapskate and not bother learning
03and it was only 3 weeks
Like with SMBW
12It's different here, you have to be insured or take official lessons with an instructor and it's about £15- £20 a lesson at most
InfamousZed, Me too
03wtf
There's just something about it that makes you really get into it
But I dont have a playstation
especially if you play with more than one person
RPGs?
aka Farenheight (sp?)
paper mario/mario &luigi
Ohh
Never played either of those
12Which is VERY hard to come by in England, most cheap people use carparks XD
they are good
03heh
o.o
Really?
12I havent tried since then simply because I dont wanna pay LOL
That was one of my favorite games since the first three Spyros
12It's not that I can't afford it, I am just being cheap
12£200 a year!?! TST costs that!
ahahaha, I hated that one
I didn't mind it when I replayed it though
oh yeah i remember him was annoying
03XD
03my server cost me $7 for a full year
/me hides
12XD
it was hard getting the last few of him
12Anyway
03well
03it's usually a certain cost a month
03but it was a promo deal
Indigo prophecy is like guitar hero with a controller.
No jok
03jumping from host to host and grabbing the first-time sales :D
hm?
brawl has difficulty levels in the story and the metroid games
joke*
yeah but thats brawl
huh..
Over and over and over.
its pretty linear too.
I wish we had Brawl...
you could get it
No
Rated T
12I gotta go!
its onnly T
12Sjsflksadjgadg
...
12:D/D:
lol oh come on
She's 12
12Sorry/Seeya!
GEEZ
I know
It's stupid
ESRB doesnt know how to rate games.
03:(
03k
bye
D:
Nah, she doesn't watch TV
12Random trip out quickly :D
/me leafs
The only reason it got the T rating is because of the guns
wtf, really?
Wow
only thing wrong i see with brawl is the way that solid snake is laying on top of samus
They don't have anything like that in Melee
And that got the T rating too
or compromising positions that result in halarious laughter
the GTA series has a lot of innuendo
i immagin
but theres no nudity like ive heard
remember the coffee shop mod?
I dont mod games
yeah but have you heard of it?
GTA IV has really nice graphics though
yeah
hot coffee
yeah
Was it that hidden porn scene?
yes
that they had but removed.
id recommend it to anyone.
the map is HUGE
but then came me which had 10 seconds of flesh fondling
my brother bought it a while ago
ive heard of that.
Saints row
really?
never tried saints row
but hear its like GTA
but co-op
id figure it was a gta wana be
o.o
I like dreaming
oi... anyone know anything about gps/es
navagation

that pic above was not photoshopped
wtf
02The uh...
XD
wth o_O
there would have to be a reason why there is a 100 foot smooth hole in the middle of a city going strait down then...
its a sinkhole
but for it to be a really smooth hole in itself makes it sort of a longshot too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATpSPNIuj3M
Ahh. the dove comes out of his jacket.
lol
ha
haven't seen him
hmm
Since I banned him from my channel
I dunno
That last night we saw him where we were all talking about my computer couldn't have pissed him off that much on its own
yeah but he all of the sudden got all pissy
He's that age
15 right?
yeah
Yeah, 15 sucked
my brother is 14 and hes not that way
he was when he was 12 though
My sister's 12 and she's like that now
but they all go through it different
It's different for everyone I guess
Yeah
haha
he deserved half the crap i gave him
Also wouldn't stop him from getting into here and draconicwolves
yeah
heard anything about lambda's employment?
Yeah, he's taking the job
They have to do another offer though
He doesn't know yet
how about you? how are you doing over there?
lol
It's actually not too bad
/me hugs back
It doesn't really seem like 9 hours
they keep me busy
thats good
o.o why?
its only 16 pounds
you get use to it
my feet hurt like no other
hmm
i like cash
They haven't been telling me to do them
I had some that were incomplete my second day
i tried dodging them too but they eventually caught me
But they disappeared
=/
haiz
Yeah
There used to be incomplete ones, but I logged in again later and they weren't
I like the ones about diversity and being nice to people
XD
it's like being back in 3rd grade
lol i liked the ones about sextual harassment in where 4 out of five were done with female against male
J?
Oh yeah, haha
SR: Walmart
hahahaha
only one example had the typical sextual harassment theme
The computer learning things they make you do are completely retarded
and be extremely racist or something.
haha
yeh?
i imagin they get those quite a bit
it's not exactly hard to get hired there
nah it's ok obsi
They probably call every application they get for an interview
I noticed
really
/me nodnods.
hi!
hi!
are their bugers really beef or is it brothe basted soy
"But you just have to talk a little more slowly and be nice to him!"
i understand that sort of thing
Yeah
but i hate it when they take advantage of their diabilities
They're not going to know he needs that
that was hard
the deaf kid would often get me to help customers for him and when he spilled something he would sometimes leav it for someone else to clean
here are some tips
not gonna XD
I''ve got the feeling it's gonna trigger something
aoeu
See it didn't trigger anything :)
oh crap i forgot my list...
damnit.
:P
Lol
I have a list of 4 points
lol
But i forget the way I worded it.
Dvorak :)
We'll probably be using my discount to buy groceries
you cant
http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?77
10%
Aw, really?
>_> lame
That sucks
food doesn't count unless its like snacks or something
anything other than food or clearence items
:P
And a computer if I can find a good one
it is anymore
id recommend either just getting the highest walmart has or just look at another place for another computer
I was looking at their computers last week
around 700
hey
:D
Hey
:D
12Lambda....
/me falls to the ground
/me flees
Hah, now is the walmart club complete?
Lol yeah
it is...:(
Haha
All three of us are here
:P
We need a channel
XD
toilet duty?
lol
XD no
Umm, something to do with Star Wars
I have a walmart laptop
best laptop i own.
*sigh* no
:P
I thought that was yesterday
no that was a different one
get a drink?
Lol he doesn't drink
not in front of you he doesnt
XD
if Coke counts then yes
/me 7blinks
7LOL, Obsi.
You drink behind my back huh?
7You actually added those fail peas. XD
speaking of which... wheres rurik been lately?
7Unless all of them are added accidentally. O_o
There are a lot of alchoholics on my dad's side.
and my mom's side only has one or two.
I don't think there are any alcoholics in my family
i dont drink cause it all tastes nasty
if i do its to releive stress
But I think I have enough self control do drink.
We've migrated back to Spyrochat, eh?
/me curls up on Quan's tails and falls asleep
Yeah, Infamouz was there
My cousin was trying to give me vodka
Talking to nintendofreak
and my aunt was trying to give us all wine
I've had alcohol before
the way I see it
ive never had vodka though..
it's different seeing all the activity there again
lol
you need to take the mystery out of it for kids.
howd ya like it?
XD
It was OK
My aunt drinks a minimum of 3 bottles of wine at my parties.
They offered to let me have a taste of their alcohol sometimes when they had it
and take a sip
/me hides
yeah, I do that too
7MIB
7LAG
I might not invite her this year
I haven't drank alcohol since I was three
02Yes, I brought the MIB upon us
oi 3 bottles..
because theres no wine left for everyone else.
lol
no she has a tolerance.
Is the drinking age 21 everywhere?
its 21 here
in BC
19 for tobacco.
18 for tobacco here
It is everywhere in America I think
Yeah, in Europe it differs though
In Germany I think it's 17
for examplke
I think it's younger than that
and at that it is very lax
They're /really/ strict about drunk driving though
in spain they have vending machines for alcohol
Protip: Don't drink to impress anyone.
yeah
lol
she was in her 2nd year of college
I think if they get busted for drunk driving they get their licenses taken away
now she has brain damage, she acts like a 10 year old child.
only way drinking can make me impress anyone is by making me talk more than usual and actually dancing
hmm
in euroup they have stricter standards for driver's licenses too
XD I think drinking helps you impress people more if it's them who's drinking
Haha
ha
You do?
Just to watch everyone acting like idiots
We should go to one of Matt's next year
:P
Hahahaha
its about the same as when we got our firearms licenses.
rdx would be proud
XD
:P
ha
I'll never own a gun
hes an indian.
No use for one
!!!!!!!!!!!!
Theres always a use for a gun.
Like when?
I don't like killing things
And the point of that is?
Wasting lead?
Its a skill, marksmanship.
its like any other sport.
Hes a liberal
A skill I have no use for
Lol yeah
I make fun of him for it all the time
:P
She does
She really does
I wish BC was a carry province.
though I never make fun of her for her views
:P
washington is awesome
Because my views make sense
:P
(jk) *shot*
No, cause I don't own a gun
XD
I should buy more guns.
You don't make fun of me because you don't own a gun?
make a collection.
no you said *shot*
Oh, got it
:P
but even if I did I would never ever do that
yeah, I would hope you'd never shoot me...
not just rifles.
its probably easier to get in the usa
around here you have to go through all this bs.
XD

You have weird liberal friends
He's censervative actually
Maybe not this one
*conservative
But most of them
there have been break ins around here
never had a breakin
me neither
But we did leave our garage open once and my brother's bike got stolen
heres one similar to one of mine
http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww270/skyking749/101_2748.jpg
any spyro news?
Hello
o.o that's a huge gun
... my old brother has multiple break ins.....
thats the kind I want to get
I probably couldn't even carry that thing
but those are illegal here.
>.>
not really
I like that style.
Oh my friend I was talking about has one of those
I amdit
I've fired it once
whats wrong with firing it?
Nothing
XD
InfamousZed, probably
Just not at something alive
all fully auto weapons are illegal here
its not fully auto
The one I fired was a semi-automatic version of it
I know.
Pretty sure it is here too
It is here too
it isnt in minisoda
apparently its not hard to modify some weapons for fully auto though
It's not?
Huh
it is hard
I always thought it was
machine gun
whats semi-automatic?
My uncle's friend has a fully auto AK he brought up country we used
semi- one pull one shot
when you have to pull the trigger once per bullet fired
spyroforum gun club.
she hasn't been home all day
I don't see why not
file the fireing pin you risk peircing the primer or unleashing several slamfires
A phone running Android
But it would cost $30 a month
Which would suck if I couldn't get a job during hte school year
i'm interested in a mobile media player that runs on android
InfamousZed, android has a built in media player.
/me is an android evangelist
$20 month full data unlimited txt/voice everything
i want something comparable to the ipod touch but not an ipod
I use Verison
It would be $30 per month
Oh you do?
Yeah
I do too
I think that means we get free mobile to mobile
its the only one in north america to use those bands.
I think that was AT&T
I'm pretty sure you said Verison
I think I did too
Because I remember you mocking their commercials
I have rogers, which is at&t compatible.
where they say they're the largest network or whatever
yeah
verizon has the best coverage.
I forget which one it was
but I do have Verizon now
there are a ton ofgreat phones out now
htc incredible, sprint evo
oh yeah... how does skype work for you guys?
skype on android?
I finally got it working
My connection sucks though
With my crappy 80s microphone

Not really
Not on my end

Kjak is back

No
Exactly the other problem
But it's not until the middle of June
I did tell her that my friend from Indiana asked me to go to Florida with him
hmm
that was the earliest time they had
but I think she took it as a joke
Because his parents are worse than mine in some ways
*over
They seem to think he's still 13
They do
>.>
I couldn't drive to her house alone
At least my parents understand the fact that I'm an adult now
she really couldnt do a thing to me
Yeah...

kja is alright if hes not spouting narcisistic noncence
He likes me for some reason
=/
Depends
:p
If I beat him in an argument, he hates me
XD
Maybe that's why he likes me
lol
brb watermelon
I don't argue with him
I just mock him\
Yeah 'cause you suck at arguing
:P
I suck at arguing tenfold
You just have to keep repeating it until he's forced to acknowledge it
lol XD
IT TOOK ME A WHOLE DAY TO PROCESS IT
I have to think about it for a while XD
lol
I can never argue
/me has been recording the stream :)
Because he doesn't listen to logic
"I don't want to talk about this anymore"

Haha, I thought it was LoneKnight
Then SR
:P
:P
Stormknight
XD
Haha
Then LoneKnight was sort of intermittent, once I'd found out you hated it him, then SR was last.
Then SR made that Stormknight photoshop
Because I stopped doing it after SR banned me, which makes sense for him to be last. XD
Oh yeah
Haha
I remember you being banned
It was over some stupid thread in the Spam forum
Yeah, maybe I took things too far. :P
/me was Hera
Uh oh

XD
XD
Oh, Goddess of marriage and women, I got it wrong.
13 year old girl
dam i screwed that up
:P
now shit is gettin unreal here... since when does the male figure head give birth
He cheated on Hera tons of times
And Hera always ended up killing someone because of it
except the virgin ones
and Hephaestes
cause he was ugly
Lol
but he got cheated ON
I think someone was Hercules
Someone in our story
oh okay
With the Spyrochat people
I know Kja, dari, and Yahoo were somehow involved
which eventually he was
Then Hail, and someone else were the serpents that were sent to kill Hercules and were killed by him?
I still never did see that one card you and Kja made, dari
when did thisgo on?
:D
Card?
Remember you posted all those cards of the mods?
I bet RDX is doing some kind of Memorial Day thing
RDX was SR's lapdog or something
Since he's in the US military
Maybe it was all Kja's doing
rdx was cerberus
*is
Can't remember which
I dunno, if I had any part in it, I can't remember it.
12Wow, I just walk out of my room, and everyone is gone, and no one told me.... I'm really loved.
LOL
But there was a card you wouldn't show me for fear of being banned
lol
Hmm.
Maybe I vaguely remember this.
I'll have to ask Kja next time he's here
LOL

2sin^2x = 5cosx - 1
Someone solve that for me. (;
:P
I think you need a calculator for that one dari
Easy without.
I do
well I fail then
It's a quadratic.
...... grabs ti 84+ oh screw this :p
You've got to factorise it.
>_>
what's the sin/cos definitions again?
There were some formulas
but I forget
sohcahtoa
No, not those
cos^2 - 1 = sin^2
Ohh
But it's sin^2x
derivative of arcsec anyone?
That's not a quadratice
I don't know
*quadratic
It is a quadratic.
Trigonometric quadratic.
:P
just a heads up
neons a dud
oh crap
You all gave up...?
Hey
hey
2sin^2x = 5cosx - 1
I assume you mean 2sin/x/^2x?
A dud or dude?
nice timing infamouz XD
Oh, thank you
lol
XD
Wait for trig
I feel dumb because I used to like doing these problems
Oh, it's meant to be 5cos^2x.
But now I can't remember how
Thanks dari
:P
XD
z
...
5cosx^2x, right?
Yep.
You can't have just cos^2x
Well I dunno why but it's actually cos^2x.
That's how all the maths teachers write it.
I think he means square the whole thing
(cos x)^2
Yeah
:P
but it's always wrtten weird in books
I've found the circle root of the squarecumference of a poly triangle.
with the squared after the cosine
cos²x
Like that.
10:P
yeah
I thought you meant cosx to the power of 2x
cos²x

like this

rmdir C:\WINDOWS\system32
02actually
Or I bet it at least gives you a warning that it's a "vital system file" or something.
02yeah
02I think rmdir was only for empty folders
02XD
You could do del /F /S /Q /A[[:]S]] *
If asterisks work.
You could do del /F /S /Q /A[[:]S]] C:\
Actually.
02I think del system32\*.* would work
Would only delete system files. XD
02system32/*.*
02I meant that
And would not ask for confirmation.
Why don't you try it. :D
:P
02xD
02basically cd\windows
02then del system32/*.*
xcopy C:\ C:\WINDOWS\system32\
02that should work
02lol xcopy
02guess that'd work too
back murr
02wb
02:3
02i'm about to sleep
Or maybe Format C:\ /Q
i can't really understand how they are that stupid though
also you need to include shutdown -s to complete the system rape
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
shutdown -i is fun.
At school. XD
It brings up the remote shutdown panel. ;)
yes that's funnier but not as rapeage
02Xeli

and it does exit when pressed
Wow
Mine's been uninstalling itself every now and then lately

03Bye Alt :<

I don't know too much about it, but I've made forms with it before
03yanaond.
PHP processes them and sends the information to another page
PHP is used on most sites now.
Because it is regarded as one of the easiest languages to learn.
My Java teacher hates php
It gives you too much freedom
12FEATHER! :o
12hai
10LL!
10hai :D
12XD
10lol
PHP is a very effective and simple language to use
Being able to use a language for anythng and everything is great.
10Feather, Pokewalkercheat failed to listen to you once again
He'd kill you for saying that
:P
It means you don't end up having to learn many different languages.
cause he's stuck teaching something that he knows is surpassed by PHP :P
he's just jealous
10-_-
and he'd basicallly tell him to stfu
"Shut up Owen, we're not talking about PHP right now"

His location and sig are completely inappropriate
and then you have a single rule
There are no reported posts
Once you delete the post, the report that was tied to it goes away
I know.
But I fixed that poll one
link?
and the swears in the one
What's the poll one?
and when I went to get them off the reported posts menu it told me I was "not authorized"
http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-11109-who-belive-ripto-is-a-[censored].html
someone just reported it because it was in the wrong spot

/me eyerolls

Doesn't matter though if there's no report though
it was there you must have deleted it

that or SR did
As good as I can get to deletion

14I swear everyone purposely forgets that I don't have a decent comp
02It doesn't take too much
1464MB RAM remember
then you should prioritize other things
trust me
02takes up 90mb
0219mb*
02of memory
02on my laptop
02I'm just asking him lol
02not forcing
14Yeh this has about 5MB free XD
02XD
14If my laptop was hooked up to the net then fine
14Or wireless
14Either one
02o.o
14ffff my ISP keeps blocking BT Ports >>
02:|
02I hate sore losers
02who go 'fuck you' when they lose
02it's annoying
14Wow how fucking stingy does my ISP wanna be -v-
._.
14I've got 0.3% of a 58.4mb Torrent left to download >>
02o.o
02I agree
02if I remember correctly
02"It's not the winning or losing that matters...it's how much fun you had that matters."
well people playing games need to learn that
02^
02Also lol
04^
too many people are like OVER 9000 GB RANK GIT GUD RANDOMNAHSuAHSIUAHSA
04ohnoes I lost
02I like having psychic on Lucario
02lol rank doesn't matter tbqh
04you sick fucker made me lose
04you're an asshole
04[/etc]
i mean, i don't say GG if someone outright cheats. and no, not like "using an overpowered weapon" but like pulls the cord to avoid a recorded loss or hacks
otherwise i don't give a fuck :D
14lol
02[20:21:00] <~Espeon> i mean, i don't say GG if someone outright cheats. and no, not like "using an overpowered weapon" but like pulls the cord to avoid a recorded loss or hacks
02I hate other people using legends/ubers
02But I usually say gg anyway
02unless they actually CHEAT
^v^
14ra
dsfopfsd
Silly irc clients
well if it's in uber tier you don't have a single word to say anyway, and i thought the tier things on pokeyman online restricted ubers but well
02I stay on OverUse
02d
02people use ubers on overused as well
Die
02o_O
x.x there
02pulling the cord?
well say if you play on ps3
and you're losing
02lolwut
Fleef lol
you pull the ethernet/disconnect the router to force a "disconnect" - usually not recording as a loss
14I'm meh, you?
02Actually
Same
02Pokemon online rates that as an automatic loss
02I think
02Want to try?
I
I'm dandy*
02otherwise they automatically lose after a minute
02because they were losing
02pretty badly
02then they tried to disconnect
lol
02so all in all, they lost
02^^
well most games nowadays either keep a disconnect %
and i always chuckle when I see like "2343 wins, 2 losses, 72% disconnect"
tl;dr^
04lol
hm
i bet someone has some hilarious tryhard quotes there
04lol
02I've seen some people like that
/facepalm

good to know people from the states reassuring not all of them are like this stereotype ;)
5Yeah... only the ones on TV are like the stereotype 95% of the time.
That's strange, people in a channel called #furry, also in a channel called #4chan, lol.

Exactly.
03http://www.humor-articles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/woman_exam_answer.jpg <-- ROFL
5How can you really say that about religion though?
seen it
12XD
5Yeah, saw it too, DRF.
Most of the time, religions believe that they are self-righteous and other religions are false
5./Always?/
12Stupid artblockage is catching up with me .
12XD
yeah
5See, there's a huge difference between "always" and "most of the time".
12Brb in 5
12chore crap
12alreadyX
12XD
in the early ages it were the Pharaohs and the people all around fighting wars and slaughtering for "THEIR GOD"
5So the argument you're making is that if there were no religion, their would be very few wars.
not necessarily religion; any fanaticism
03http://www.humor-articles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hard_water_answer.jpg <-- that was on failblog
7yeah?
that's where a too high amount of religion always leads you to
03D:
non-fanatic religion is good
There real reason is probably for land or resources, etc.
Roleplay4life: please listen carefully. I said "high amount" of religion
You know you're surrounded by furries when someone asks "What're you?" and the response "Human" creates an awkward silence. :o
religion is used for justification, and the people that are fanatics believe it
and how do you call the actions of Bush then?
he also invaded Iraq "for god's sake"
7... elaborate
5I call them shortsighted and biased.
7ah
Bad use of religion, the pope telling people in Africa not to use condoms. :o
5He was /not/ fit to be president AT ALL, in my opinion.
TimeShift, I'm arguing that, it's used for justification of causes, but it's not the reason
12Bacl
12*k
12:D
well, this religious background was the reason Bush was elected in fact
wb
5Not entirely.
Yes, and that's not necessarily bad.
7was this in any sort of context or is it just a re-hashing of an old xkcd joke?
5It was post-Clinton administration.
12Ty
No I made it up from something that just happened to me on another server.
5He was a Republican and son of a former president. People thought he'd be a good change.
12C:
5That.
7I seez.
07well overly religious people are hardly the majority
5That's how every president has gotten elected here. (More or less.)
5@Kyu :: They're a very loud bunch though. xD
03why the frick are we discussing religion
we're getting closer to connect religion to war ;)
I never did get to finish that argument about logic...
07because TS doesn't mind breaking the rules XP
But I was definitely right.
03Nazi Germany? Pssh, it has nothing on Soviet Russia
/me runs
Stereotypes, looks like
about patriotism
5Yeah.
5I'm not denying that, TS.
12Indeed it does D:
lol
5Everything can be manipulated to one's own selfish purposes.
12x3
/me wonders how many times he'll get cussed out at work today
12o.O?
03They switched us over to prepay only before you pump a week ago and people are still mad about it xD
oh boy...
12xDD Wow
12yus
12X3
12Okay D:
How do you pay before you put the petrol in, how can you know how much you're going to use?
and that's why I ask to not be overly religious
03bye
03They have to give a certain amount and if they don't pump it all we give their change back
Oh, seems a bit of an awkward system. :o
12Yeah.
12x3
Hopefully. XD

12Caw
Burd lunch :D

Hello's peoples.
Hiya
Adware isn't ususally bad as such, just annoying.
07you know
07you should just remove the smilies because they suck XD
Norton is crap.
still sucks though
Screwed up my computer.
We used to have Norton
hmm
i actually prefer plain old text emotes o.o
12LOL
14Altair same :>
Eventually I fixed it by downloading their tool to remove ALL Norton prodcuts.
omfg AOL still EXISTS?
products*
14Nick yeh XD
07considering i'm fixing yet another one of his fails lol
after all its incesent advertising and fail browsers?!
Hehe, AOL... I think they /still/ use a pair of KL-10 miniframes from DEC. :P
I don't bother, but AVG is supposed to be good.
14LOL
12and spam CD post..
oh yeah all the old ISP's did that
i've heard zone alarm is awesome and free
AOL was the best... in 1995
Wanadoo as well
14Yeh 15 years ago LOL
My first wireless router was Wanadoo
Firewalls just interfere with my programs and I'd disable it 5 minutes later.
LOL I have a ton of AOL CDs
14AOL CD's = Good frisbees
they still sent them to us when we had their service
Our family computer has AVG now
I just threw out the CD and kept the cases XD

First time loading up GIMP took about 30 minutes for me (may be an exaggeration, can't remember well).
5 hour difference I believe
maybe it has to do with Vista

Because it got to "loading texts" and that took aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages.
before or after?
1400 GMT
XP, 1GB RAM, 124 GB hard drive

if only XD
its still the first month of war
but I have been at an advantage
I re did it when I failed at my strategy early november
o.o
Finland is on my side, and Mexico is still deciding
got them to have a revolution :D
Hehe
http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine
only problem is I doubled my bombing raids on western europe
tripple on Nationalist spain
Don't take over Munich though! They have the awesome that is Oktoberfest! :P
though it isnt really an 'allied nation'
but the DDR needs it :P
!mate
.
HoI is good
Played the third?
No
I'm tempted to either download Arsenal of Democracy
or HoI3
if you like HoI2, you probably can't go wrong with HoI3
but the doomsday campaign is bascially the epic yet hard campaign of the whole
ic
since, if you suck at grand scale games
then poland
and then a looong climb to Moscow
hardest front I say is central europe and the turkish regions
/me yawn
I don't play it often, but I enjoy trying to be as weird as possible.
yeah p:
Tibet ruling the world as an example :p
has that happened on HoI III?
I do not know
I need to update HOIDDA to play as more nations
I thought the third one was quite realistic, it was hard to do much as any of the smaller nations
HOI3 has 'said' that you can play as any nation
bye o//
Creideiki: but I must say
However... it is /hilarious/ when they get any sort of military (good bye Afghanistan).
they defend it more than their own isles
hello again
hey
What's up?
not much
you?
even in war time
Also... the biggest "battle" I had as Tibet... was invading China.
which one?
/me hides
All of them. :P
XD
A whole lot of nothing....
in my doomsday campaign
(Except the PRC... which became an ally... for some strange reason.)
the CC one is going to roll over all of them
(And whom I promptly encircled... and crushed.)
yello
did he say anything?
its ironic, i can't reach japan
dari scared him with ayumi
I surrounded it but no transport boats
lol
my one weakness really
again?
XD
Haha.
Isn't is !mateplz, or something?
Well that worked.
(Yes, I give all my missions names. :P )
o.o
thanks ;o
o.o
Creideiki: LOL me too XD
I have several' missions' then and even name enemy missions :p
I have the "through Berlin, Across the Rehim!" Campaighn
the "balkan liberation" campaign
o.o
then I completed the "The fall of occupation in South K." campaign
D:
Getting into Berlin was entertaining...
I then "moved in" to Finland, Sweden and Denmark...
Whereupon... Germany had a bad day... :P
I let them keep this one piece of annoyance in the middle of Siberia though. :P
XD
but bascially my operation is to cut the top half of Italy from the rest of Europe
(think of taking the whole 'pure' leg from the rest of the infection)
then finish with it
and then cut through the rest of france
and invade Spain

Okies arti
5Hawkiiiiee. That banner is cute. 83
Aw thanks =)
Miiburd made it.
5I like the gallery thing you have where the pictures become clearer when you hover over them with the cursor. That's cool~
I can't code x3;;
but thank you =) I need to fill it with content, four years and nohing has been done LOL
5You could always learn. O:
Haha, noob.
5There are sites out there that teach you CSS.
5That's kind of ridiculous.
Someone on another server. XD
5Fffffff. xD
Never seen them before, they just turned up.
LOL
ew
/whowas bellows
5DANGIT ARTI
5xP
5Quit complaining geesh
5./kidding, kidding
give me voice plz
5HI DRF
03it means if the channel becomes +m then you can talk
Basically it's used in conjunction with +M (I think it's +M), which means you can only talk if you have a voice (+v).
well it allows you to speak when a channel is silenced by +m
5Ahh. I see.
let's give it a try
5What?!
03LOL
03no
03oh LOL hi Arti
I can lk, you. can't!
Xd
talk, ffs
ok now
03see, this is why touchscreen keyboards fail
/me runs
/msg #silverwings :o
5Can -- can I talk now?
03yes
5YAY.
I was going to voice rp4l
5That was bizarre.
People usually have channels set up for automatic +v on entry with +m on.
03oh
03LOL
you ruined my demo
03XD
03Sorry
03therfe
03*there
5Oh hey~
5 8D
5That's neat.
we tried that once
forgot why we stopped
/me 5is now mute. D:
03XD
/me 5moves her mouth but nothing comes out.
5Oh wait, I'm at a keyboard.
03that scene gave me nightmares
5LOLwut?
5Oh.
03The Little Mermaid
5Ursula.
5Yeah.
03you know, when she sucks Ariel's voice out?
5I just remembered that.
03yeah
03that's seriously scary to little kids XD
/me 5hasn't seen that movie in yeeeeears.
5Ursula was seriously the only halfway-interesting character in "The Little Mermaid", in my honest opinion.
03LOL
03you remind me of my friend
5Really?
03yeah
03he tends to like the villians more than the good guys
03like Jango Fett is his favorite character in Star Wars Episode 2
5LOL, Arti, **type? /shot
03I honestly think PatF looks kinda dumb
5Understood.
5I wanna see PatF because it has JAZZ MUSIC!
03LOL
03I just don't because it seems dumb
5And it takes place in N'arleans~
03Hercules was alright
03Pocahontas was so-so
03but most of their "traditional" animated movies after that were kinda meh
03now I did like Atlantis, but that's kinda its own category
03as it wasn't based on a book
03that movie sucked
03I actually watched it
why?
03and was like, wtf is this
03I just didn't like it
you still can't give a reason
see? LOL
03you still can't give a reason for why it's good :P
03and LOL
03RP4L, have you seen that Bilbo Baggins song? XD
5And if I did, it was a few years back.
5YES.
5OMIGAWD.
5CREEPIEST THING EVER.
5 xDD
03the second is actually unopened
03I should sell it
5There were /two!?/ Dang.
03yes
5What sooooong.
03the Bilbo Baggins one
5Oh, ha.
03and good morals
03XD
03now THIS movie is good
home on the range???!!!
03LOL
GOOD ANJMATION???
03I actually didn't hate that movie
/me hides
...
5I looooove Monsters Inc.
THAT WAS HOTRIFIC
5It was not /that/ bad.
Lol, hotrific.
stupid crappy movie
03well
03*studio
To each their own? :o
03but most of the other ones
exactly
03are good animation
5For sure, Dari. xD
03that's the exceptions that proves the rule
/me hides
03-s
03*=.=
5Didn't Dreamworks do "Up"?
03no
5Now that was a good movie.
03that was Pixar
5Who did?
5Oh, right.
03That was alright
5I loved Up. 83
03I like pretty much all of Pixar's movies
03their TV channel has turned to crap
03and Finding Nemo, while it's still a good movie, is waaaaay overrated
03my favorites are Toy Story and The Incredibles
03XD
5MICHAEL GIACCHINO. 833
03oh yeah
5<333333
yeh there's no animals.in it that's why
03Michael Giacchino FTW
5He won a whole bunch of awards for his work on Up.
03Not because of Star Trek but because of The Incredibles :P
03lots of Pixar movies don't have animals o.o
03in fact very few do
03Yes
03that's where I heard the name
03...XD
03but yes
5YEAH. And he also does/did the music for Lost, Alias, and Fringe.
03I tend to like movies about people more
03I'm not into beastiality
/me runs
03that and meh talking animals, it just seems silly to me
5What about Pokeymaaanz?
5D:
03Pokémon aren't animals
that's reallt rude
03and they don't talk
5xP
03well
03It's not like I Hate all movies about animals
03Seabiscuit was pretty good
wtf is that
03well
03Arti|mobile, Seabiscuit is a movie about a horse
03who used to be a race horse but then he got injured
03etc
03that one's good though
03then there were like two other movies that used the exact same story that sucked
03because they just repeated the same story >_>
I don't like horses
5Which ones were those DRF?
03um
03Dreamer was the most recent
5Dakota Fanning?
03and I don't know the name offhand of the other
03yues
03*yes
5(People sometimes tell me I look like her.)
03that movie was ugh
busy again
5'Kay Arti.
03I watched it with her and was like... this is the kids' version of Seabiscuit
03but eh
5Really?
03yes
03it's just an epic story
one more thing
5But that's just me.
5What?
I haven't seen Alladin!!
5OO:
5OOOO:
I never really get why people say I don't like ... because it's overrated, surely if lots of people like it, it's because it's good?
5You haven't?!
03LOL Arti, you should see it
/me hides
5--;;;
There's a parrot?
03actually wait
03what's his name, Abu?
5What about the weird Dragon-thing that Jafar turns into?
5Abuuu~!

I could swear there's a parrot. :o
03yes
5Yeah.

03that
I thought it was weird you pasted it again
LOOL
poor dinosaurs!
5xDDD
5I should take that to church DRF.
5My pastor would get a kick out of it.
03go for it o.o]
/me sitsonnaBeto
5Um...
5They existed?
5LOL, I dunno.
over no Christiana actually take Noah's ark story as anything more than a story
the dinosaurs are the ones that didn't fit in the ark.
*sigh*
/me ahem
5The Bible isn't to be taken literally.
*over here
5Most of it's symbolic.
orly?
how come they always cite it in a literal sense then?
5Airwolve, I have no idea.
RP4l more people should have that attitude lol
5Yeah. -sigh- But ya can't change people.
5I mean I believe the whole "Jesus died for us, was ressurrected, etc. etc.." but I know that Jonah didn't /really/ get eaten by a whale.
5Ffff I want to write a sermon and involve PokÃ©mon in it. xD
5Wut.
5That makes no sense Airwolve. xD
Some people take the Bible literally.
Others don't.
5I kinda want to go into Ministry, actually. Go to seminary.
5But at the same time I want to go into Physics.
5Auuugh too many interests. ;;
I know that feeling
5I'll probably end up going the Physics route.
5I know that in the ministry pastors (for the United Methodist church) always get moved; I'd hate to get attached to a church and then have to leave four; five years later.
5I had a pastor that was practically part of my family and when he left I was devastated...
I had that happen to me when I was little
5We're not arguing DRF. D:
03XD
03still
03I stay away from religious discussions
03because I don't really relate to them
5Aren't you fascinated by Philosophical discussion?
yeh we know
03and no I'm not LOL
5xP
03now if you start talking about technology...
/me runs
you just like to keep saying it and involving yourself anyway
03XD
03is that a bad thing?
03<Arti|mobile> you just like to keep saying it and involving yourself anyway <-- that
yes because its annoying
I dunno, I find it hard to believe in something that we made up. :o
03XD
phone
03yeah, that reminds me of a Bash quote
dari, exactly.
5Bash?
03yeds
03*yes
5xD DRF, yeah.
5Red Cross, UMCOR, Salvation Army...
/me 5shrugs.
5Two sides to everything.
03except a square.
03that has four sides/
/me runs
5xD
o.o
03LOL, I didn't realize George Lopez was in this movie
03The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl
03it's kinda lame, but XD
Guys
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkjyZHZhokM
/me is scared
03XD
5BREAKFAST CLUUUUUUUUUB.
03yeah
03same
03I haven't seen it in a while, which is why I'm watching it again
5<333
03I recorded it off TV yesterday
5Nice.
03I quite like this jock character
5Who do you like best of the crew?
03because I always hated jocks
5Oh, ahah.
03but the fact that he actually feels bad about it
03is cool
5I've never had issues with "jocks".
03well
03I'm a nerd
5In fact I usually get along really well with them. xD
03jocks tend to beat up nerds
5I am too DRF!
03yes but you're a girl
03*up
03which was nice
5Aahh.
Wow, is America actually like that?
5...I don't know any of those types, LOL.
03Yes
5No.
03Roleplay4life, well, those guys are typically nice to girls
5>>;;
5I've never seen people being mean to "nerds" that are "jocks" at my school.
5And we have over 2500 people here.
03we had like 2000
5I think if you just find common ground then it's all fine.
/me 5shrugs.
03I think I have the right to say they do act that way
03in middle school at least... in high school they kinda left me alone
5Hm. Well, that's really unfortunate. =/
03yep
03that's why I'm used to people making fun of me
Wth is middle school.
Middle school = primary school?
5Middle school is like ages 12-14.
036th-8th grade
03or that
5**7th - 8th grade here.
5D:
03back in 7th and 8th grade
03most of those were the football players >_>
5I can't believe could be that mean!
03Yeah
5(My middle school football team sucked LOL.)
03for 3, here
5Sometimes four years Dari.
Ok... O_o
5It varies from district to district.
weird....
but anywsy
I had horrible things said to me too
03typically I think boys make fun of boys and girls make fun of girls
03right?
Not really.
03XD
03well
At my sister's old school, some of the boys spat at her.
03You're probably "cool"
no, boys make fun of everyone here
^ Yeah,
03here, the boys were too polite to do that
03-l
Some kid threw a bin at my sister. O_o
03ah, well
03that's probably why XD
5**make fun of myself
Roleplay4life: Lol, you told people that here in school, you wouldn't hear the end of it till you left.
5Really?
03yeah
03well this is back when Pokémon wasn't as cool
5And people have this bizarre fascination with my fanfics.
schools in England are just disgusting. ..most of them
03same here, but mine was pretty good actually
5So I dunno what's up with the differences between Nebraska and where you live, DRF, LOL.
03which is one reason my parents moved here
03Troy School District is said to be like one of the top 10 in the country
5(Midwestern hospitality FTW?)
seriously I've been physically assaulted enough times
5DD:
03and our county is the 4th safest in the country too
03probably why they moved here, like I said XD
5In school Arti?
Mm, some kids in primary school (year 6) tried to rape my sister's friend in the toilets.
mostly from other schools infact, on my way home from school
WTF
Yeah, and we went to a pretty good primary school too.
5Wow.
Brb
5'Kay Dari.
but every other school around us..
>v>
5Daaaaang.
5For some reason, people have just never been mean to me. I count my blessings.
5><
5For no reason!
yeh well, like I said.. kids and schools in this country ffs...
And all of them seem to drink, smoke, and do various drugs.
I was on the train just last week in a very rich.area. and these 10-16s got on that were fare dodging and smelled of drugs
At my current school they not many people do, I go to a good school now.
few and far between
I have no idea why but somehow in 2-3 years just about all smoking at my school has stopped
Yeah, it's and all-boys grammar school.
5Same here Dari. A lot of druggies.
go around all the places where they did ... no-one there. And I can find no explanation
5Strangely, though, I've never been offered anything. And if I ever do, I just tell people I'm allergic.
5And then they leave me alone.
5I actually think I am allergic to cigarettes...
5And LOL Airwolve.
waaaaat
isn't a good ol' adrenalin high enough enymore?
/me wants Six Flags.
guaranteed 100% harmless to humans and from a trusted source
well, that is, if you trust yourself.
lol
I feel uncomfortable talking about smoking, drugs etc. anywhere but here..
like I walk down the street and can smell drugs as if they were cigarettes
5I got an Adrenaline High writing a fanfic once. xDD
and its always kids and uni students
lol
arti, being near bradford may have biased you *cough*
lol
5Yeah. It's kinda sad actually.
one thing about here is that Bradford rarely crosses over
infact, all the rubbish areas in Leeds seem to keep to themselves
brb
can we reeeeeally say anything about "it's kinda sad" while here?
5What do you mean?
its like, harmless..
yo
for*
anyway lol brb again, stopping me from working
5That's fine Arti,
5**.
03there's 3 guys and two girls, right
5What, DRF?
10hi RP4L~
03and the nerdy one ends up not having a girl at the end of the movie
/me runs
10LOL
5Uh...
03though it's weird
5Happened the same way in 16 Candles.
03they all hated each other and then they're like oh, wanna go out?
03How the frick did that happen
03I haven't seen 16 Candles
5'80's movie magic, DRF.
03but I ended up liking it XD
5Heeey~
5oo;
5Bye?
03it's called a ping, happens all the time :P
5I know.
5It's still weird whenever it does happen.

5Hi anyone who's here.
Swaff's always been that way I've done my best to ignore it
\o
It's always really annoyed me but I just do my best to stop the situation and try to forget about it
hmm
Where is everybody?
Look at their sigs too.
It'd sure cause a lot of e-hellfire but if you think that's what's best then go for it
Hello
Hello
Why have I never noticed this before?
I need to get my eyes checked :P
It's been up for a few years
Apoc it wouldn't make much of a difference it's not all that crowded here alot...
sometimes members come though
a har and a half I think.
year*
O.o I overslept until 14:00!
SR I think it's been up about two years didn't it start in summer 2008?
10I oversleep often
Just got a scope for my airsoft gun =P
I dont remember the exact date, it might have been longer than I thought.
I can't find the post I made two seconds before. I usually go onto theneedledrop's BlogTV
/me puts kipi on his bak
The scope is actually a real rifle scope, but it fits perfectly
Keyboard is being retarded again
Really? That's the only thing they sell in Dick's
5Dang Kipikipo!
;-; Half the day is gone
5The latest I've ever slept is 11:30 AM.
This never happens
5And I was sick. ><
that's like the normal time i sleep to if I have nothing due that day lol
i usually wake up 8:00-ish.
not 14.00
Paintball would be worse because the mass of a paintball is much higher than that of an airsoft bb.
XP
Awesome, I just got a flashlight for my rifle too.
It's not a very good one, but it works fine
Why would you need a flashlight?
I taped it on there with electrical tape.
12lol
Works really well when you wear blue tinted goggles.
The man's method
Playing during the night? I don't know, but I have 3 slots that I can put things on,
Need to find one more thing to put on the rifle...
Any ideas?
Bayonette
In an airsoft gun fight?
I play during the day.
Dude, we're not actually trying to kill each other.
And besides, the slots are on the two sides and top. The bayonet wouldn't reach the tip
Damn
10Altguest
Wait, how does this whole thing work?
ugh ._.
The BBs keep curving upwards when I shoot
Maybe that's because I'm using light BBs?
Oh you use BB rounds. Which hurt like fuck on bare skin
Umm...
lol creative
Airsoft gun, not a real BB gun...
Hop-up?
this is my last day in this place thankfully
What's a hop-up?
you want a little bit of curve up though for distance.
moving into the apartment with a half-decent connection tomorrow, i hope
are they going right up within 20 feet of firing?
Yrd
Yes
yeah thats the hopup.
07hooray for half-decent?
07I guess?
07o3o
What's a hop-up?
Okay, one sec
Hopup is a little piece of rubber that scrapes the top of the bb as its propelled out.
you need to find the sweetspot between curve and distance.
12hmm
Yeah ._.
12it could be half bad
5xD;
12Bleh, drawing..
5oo;;
http://uploads.mibbit.com/yBtMTx.jpg
Where do you guys go? To fight that is
I don't think I have a hopup adjustment
forgot to mention, I'm possible going away again, not sure how long though
sub-$100 guns wont have it
Then I don't
12Where/why?
I got it for $70, and it can with a pistol
Friends, because I need time away from home
And we don't "go" anywhere
You play where you want, like in the woods
It's like paintball except more realistic and less painful. But I never played airsoft before
Well I don't normally play with guns. I'm more of a nerd.
12Cant come to Leeds though??
You'd have a ball in my back yard.
But my friend invited me, and I thought "Why not?"
You can be a nerd and like guns.
I thought I already explained why I couldn't
2 acres
12No, you've been saying different things the past few months
80 acres of forest, ponds, and fields
see the part thats flapped open?
But I'm not going to play at my house
thats where you'd adjust the hopup.
I'm pretty I said that I had to use the savings I had for leeds to travel between home and my nans
My yard is tiny
pretty sure*
How do the guns work?
I think my phone takes pretty good pictures.
ApoctheOmniscient, you pull the trigger and it shoots bbs.
Depends
12Yes you did say that but after that you said you might still be coming, then you gave no reason the next time I asked..
5mp
Haha
Pretty good.
lol this is getting ridiculous
/me should be an optician
Hybrids look the coolest, since they give off smoke and eject cartridges for extra effect
You need an electic one.
there are co2 ones too.
Spring-action are the cheapest
Hold on let me check something
Looks like I've got some searching to do
Probably even less in the usa.
That one in the pic above was $100 at walmart
3rd to 4th right?
You'll still never hit anything with a scope
Â£29.90 for a Smith and Wesson M3000 Clear
The sub-$250 guns are highly inaccurate and a scope doesnt help
w/ be happening?
even if you get .20 gram.
they still go all over the place.
oh
I totally knew that
lol
M4
You can get it at walmart as the "M4 field duty kit"
I should make it to England sometime
TST goes to Warsaw
I don't have Walmart in the UK
Sometime. Possible 2012.
Not sure yet, it's an idea :>
Online
I don't know about that SR, my rifle would be pretty accurate if not for the curving
5./shot
5xD
that might be too la- damnit
xD
OH
LOL
fdkhjsgihdfv
lol
5LOL, 2012 girl.
And I've yet to see one above $250
I have used it outside
It doesn't take much.
Using it inside might be a bad idea
=P
5I really need to take "Bad Romance" off of loop.
/me is listening to Candlebox

But Bad Romance is alright, yes.
04hello
5BF, I know, but I like her music.
5It's catchy.
Found that out by accident when I didn't realize it was already pumped. When I saw it shoot 2 BBs, I tried pumping it multiple times
it's boring
5D:
i can't stand her
Where is Spyro22? He told me to be here.
yo
5Eh, to each his/her own.
THUDTHUDTHUStalklittlesenseTHUDTHUDTHUD

<Bloatedfish> Lady Gaga is horribly, horribly overrated.

and I am a real man

Yeah Radeon wasn't my favroite person to talk to.
(However... if you're going for the purposes of "My grade average! The 85 destroys it!" reasons... no it's not compulsory. :P )
and then they complained that all theists hate atheists and I replied that I'm theist and I could care less about atheists and they're both like "I just gained a lot of respect for you Lambda"
because apparently they're done talking about it
02Credits to graduate

And they matter for...University?

robbin hood?
http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3954597/

03Hi :3
12c:
Okies!
thought it was info but ok
03that's my server
07ohaiburd
03what's wrong with that?
03I always leave my computer on, ew turning computers off
12We have to PAY for our electricity you know
03computers don't use that much power
03just turn the monitor off
12If I left my computer on every day it would eat up money
03I figured it out for my parents once
03it costs like a dollar a month
03*computer
03assuming like 500WQ
03-Q
12Wheee~!
12DRF thats like saying "I dont care if I leave the lights on all the time"
12It wastes electricity
03not really
03because lights have no reason to be on when you aren't home
lol
03my computer, on the other hand, does
12Same with my computer
03as I use it as a file server and I record TV on it...
12I don't need it on, I have a server
12and thats on 24/7
12I keep on finding epic win music.
12<3
12No it's not n00b
03so that way it doesn't slow me down during the day
12Our server is really efficient as well
03well, not counting my laptop
12Mine on the other hand is not
XD
12Indeed XD
hmm...
/me roars for no apparent reason.
12o.o
It is I, Hannibal Lecter!
Or Apc

Hello to all

14The one thing that bugged me about the sea today
14It was stupidly warm ovo
12Thats how i like it.. I wont swim in cold sea XD
That's a javascript engine, right?
14No Arti, the Sea (here anyway) usually always has that chill
14But today it was like jumping into a normal swimming pool XD
yes, mozilla's engine.
14Ohai

Roleplay4life, I'm in a role-play and I'm stuck on how to have my character react adequately
5Hmm...

14I is hyper, and very floofy
/me cuddles the floof
Want to do it in PM? =)

03power may go out
-.o

Racist to whom?
Stupid people?
Please, that's shouldn't even be considered a religion

12D:
They're mad

12xD
14And oh wow, I DID catch the sun today!
And seeing how you need to pay to get in?
Like a ridiculous amount
wasn't my point but I'll let you ramble about it lol
Here in America, it became an official religion, and everyone was like "Wtf?"
Good thing we don't get that here
03XD
I still don't even know how these presidents are elected here...
:D
*shrug

Fail power cut
Don't even know the difference
Or English(US) and English(UK)
5I'll be back in a minute~
K
This summer I get to travel to Costa Rica!
Dude, don't you know there are dinosaurs there!?
...
No, but there are huge-ass bugs
7oh yeah. it's always on the news.
hahahahha
I know, heard about that. Grisly details.
I have Jurassic Park 1 2 & 3
^ My hero
Next year I get to travel to Rwanda =P
Plus extra footage
D: Extra?
7that's velociraptor central
Rwanda?
Okay, that's not even Jurassic Park related!
wb RP4L
/me 5's back.
Are velociraptors warm-blooded? Or cold-blooded?
It is now... :)
*Were
whats up
I believe they would be cold-blooded, though their apparent avairy roots might have made them warm-blooded.
*aviary
I'mduct-taping babies to my ceiling and watching them squirm. Yourself?
We robbed them of their land already...
12And odd
Not here
Native Americans own all of our casinos
I don't even know how though...
Not here
k
Native... Englishmen?
neotyguy are you kidding me :P
Espeon
The Liverpuddlians own them...I think
The people from Liverpool

Interesting

!attract
Espeon: You are attracted to 4Flareon
7anyway
12!attract
:D
Same with Eskimos to Inuits.
12o.o;
And he said Indian
12Can't Gorebyss only be female?
neotyguy they all own casinos because we took their land
If one guys says it, he represents the whole race?
12xDD
have you never been informed of this before
No, but then I looked online
you say that like it's a bad thing
A casino is such odd compensation, lol.
12orly
no I'm saying /why/ they're all run by native americans
I like being called by my first name
because you said you didn't understand
:P
You speak from experience Kja?
7says you
:p
I'm not even annoyed
13.
7really?
7jesus

bbl
12I walked down a street where the houses were numbered 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K and 1MB. That was a trip down memory lane.

Just in case I actually fall asleep XD
Ever hear of the Albino lifegaurd?

14Got a rotten headache again x-x
12Ok LLOTS
03o..o
12o.o
03-.
That is upsetting.
12kay D: night
12xD
03http://ninite.com/ = awesome
Naw, I'll just respawn after I die
12Wow xD
Team Fortress 2
I wish though
Ahh, crap I forgot to download that yesterday
7that reminds me
...
That's an old joke, we've had 2 mouse buttons for years
7sure
Has anyone seen my legs?
03XD
yeah
saw them down by applebee's
Oh, you're a life-saver, Aicepope!
:D
/me dashes after his legs impossibly.
Lol?
never happened
7yes it did
I'll eventually get TF2
7you're really shit at defending yourself you know?
7it's actually kinda entertaining
I don't really feel the need to defend myself if I don't remember it/if it's not the truth
hi rurik
7she's denying the time she banned dari for saying homosapien
4Oh yeah
4I remember that
7see? I'm sorry aicepope, but you've been voted off the island
if I'm wrong then oh well
4you used to tweek whenever someone said hom
4homo*
Rurik! How are you doing?
I trust my memory, because I know EVERYTHING
:D
7Apoc: if you're omniscient, you know where every particle in the universe is and where it's travelling, right?
Jeez Kja, just relax, it's just a joke
Why yes I do
neotyguy exactly he's uptight
:P
Apoc didn't say it, I did.
I have the power of Omniscience!
kja, you won't get it, you've never heard of Devin Townsend
7Hardly.
neotyguy you just got my respect
*mean knowing
One of my favourite albums
did you know there was a beer in Germany being called "Bit" ?
7Neon: why do you have to be omnipresent?
12Heh 8 bit
Trent Reznor
*change
7ah. I see.
LOL
Shit!
Everything I know is wrong!
No it isn't
You know how to speak english
We don't know that for sure, Apoc is typing.
We know he can write in English, however.
Am not...Oh bugger
I know that for sure, because I have Omniscience
underoos
I like the name of the latter.
Speaking of humanoid
genetic engineers and find cures to 3 different cancers.
LOL tokio hotel
He used a dictionary
7you know, considering the population of each region is about 200, there's only around 1500 people in the entire PokÃ©mon world
I was hoping he wouldn't.
It's difficult to describe from an unaided standpoint.
I gave an airborne feces...
If that happens you're gonna suffer
I won't suffer, I know I won't.
But he's actually a metal musician
apoc..it's the same damn thing :P
There is a significant difference
Yes
:P
:D.
The one thing I like more than symmetry is accuracy
Another problem I have with dictionaries is that if someone doesn't understand the word 'what', they most likely won't know the deinfition of "interoggatively" either.
Hey everybody
I know I spelled that incorrectly, but screw it.
LOL
Didn't realize.
That is exactly 4+3
They use alternations between 4 beats and 3 beats
No you are not. I know you aren't.
I'm typing in brail
*braille
:P
he's joking neotyguy
I know, I am just in my "Literal" mode right now :P
Heh
Then again, I know everything...

Nice
You got that from The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy...Good movie

12RP4L is on TeamSpeak!
But my faves are 8-Bit Theatre, Looking For Group and JTHM
5Yeah.
5But I'm not hooked up.
Two Kinds is like a freaking porno. I hate it.
5I forgot to close that down. xD
Look up Order of the Stick
I remember dpx used to be obsessed with Two Kinds
idkwtf it is but it's some sort of furry thing right
Sorta...
JTHM is great
5I could go get it...
It was made by Jhonen Vasquez
and the fact that I found the portable GBA version is just awesome
12Im hugnry
12*hungry
5How come no one ever goes on TS? It's such a cool program.
TS?
5TeamSpeak.
never heard of it
5xD
5It's on the front TST page...
12LOL
5Ooohhh.
12Most of the regulars have it as far as I know
yeah, i'm a shy floofburd
5No one here in NE has an accent. ><
what's it all about?
5(No, seriously. We speak like the dictionary.)
5It's kind of like international calling.
eh?
5Except you all get on the channel and you can use microphones to talk to each other.
5I tried it once; TimeShift was on the channel too. Pretty neat.
XD
03hxhxha
odd....
03damnit, missed her
5<3
I can't do this anymore...
12So RP4L, can you hear me ok?
D;
5Uh, I can't hear anything Arti.
12Not at the moment
12But earlier?
5No, wasn't plugged in.
12Not even to speakers? XD
5My sound wasn't on!
12Ok
5(I don't leave the volume on.)
12Lets try now
lol
5I saw the light.
XD
12Didnt hear anything?
5This is bizarre. D:
12Ah my fault
5It worked fine with TimeShift.
5Oh. xD
Haha
If I could, then I would do that.
ask infa z when he comes on
5I can hear you now LOL.
5But it's a little fuzzy.
5Oh, ha.
12Ok let me try MOAR settings
5Better.
12haha thanks
12You're impossible to hear :3
5Augh.
12lawl
07lol
12Mine is set to "Push to talk"
12how charming
12I set the middle mouse button as my talk button
5I have a laptop, haha, no mouse for me.
I can't wait for Unity 3
12You can set any button as the voice activation
/me stares at WetBunnyfox
5It doesn't let me actually. ><
12Xai has it set to Control
5Text message I mean.
12Doesm't let you send a message to all?
Unity 3?
I heard about that coming out
5Noope.
12Try right clicking where it says "Default" above our names
5OH I see now.
Yes?
Its got really good cross platform support.
/me licks
12mmm wetness :
12P
5o-o
I have yet to see Air do anything impressive
Air is basically a runtime for flash/html/css/js
'-'
12okay what's with the face
whatever you want to stick in it.
I just don't think it's really cool
I'm not on teamspeak...
12You should be :D
/me was referring to Roleplay4life
oh
5xP
And I mean good WebGL support, like Quake Live or InstantAction
how do you download the Team Speak?
!define teamspeak
12Google for it?
5You can go to the TST front page and go down to "TST TeamSpeak".
5And go from there.
5(That too.)
Bloons tower defense
is pretty awesome
12Im starving
12Im gonna go look for food, seeya later
04morning
5See ya Arti.
I don't care for AddictingGames/Miniclip/Armorgames
04heya
hey
Then you don't care for browser based games.
I mean, I am impressed at the market for them, but the individual games I am not impressed with.
No, I like some browser based games.
Quake-Live and all the InstantAction games are fun.
I know millions and millions of people like them.
do i download a client or a server?
03ihhi
/me nvms and does is later
Looks simple enough.
12Switching to laptop
7you played hello worlds?
...
7http://www.kongregate.com/games/richwsnider/hello-worlds
/me noms a biscuit
no whats that?
Unity has an awesome plugin
04hi Sneas
And unity uses C++
I think you can use javascript too
Unless you mean the scripting language, in which case they have multiple scripting layers to support Python, LUA, and a few others
Its all syntax
Pretty much
The coding language is pure C++, but the scripting languages are pretty flexible
That's actually the main reason I use to use Unity
never ehard of it.
Never tried it
/me takes a picture of the rare WetBunnyfox eat a biscuit
I like lazy languages like php.
Lol
Unity is cool because of all the platforms you can export for.
I try to stay with the C-syntax languages
They are adding android support in 3, thats why I wana try it.
How hard is it to use?
Which is REALLY saying something
Apoc, it's really easy, but it's $1000
Unless you are only using it for very simple games, in which case without the source code it's $250
....he did it again
Ive got torque here
Or if you have the internet...Free
Torque3d? Or just TGE/A
No Apoc, you can't torrent it
the torque sdk?
Or anything similar
12Ra
the torque sdk?

That'll do for me
They give out TGE for free anyway if you email them
:D
Hi
Hey
or Aero, or both XD
Don't bother with TGE, it's a weak engine, and you might as well go with something free.

Yeah, all day

:P
Hahaha
Hey Infamous
I pretty much managed the entire pets department for the last hour and a half
torquepowered.com
Oh cool
whats goin on
The manager had to leave early or something
ApoctheOmniscient, I could find a lot more links...
They really did give you walmart mod powers
I think I'm fine for now, thanks :D
Heres a guide for starting with torque: http://rapidshare.com/files/138600732/EGTGE.zip
nothin really
Lol
People say its good.
Thank you
it's really crazy in spyrochat
hmm
Working at Walmart?
Yeah
:D
raise?
It's not as horrible as you might think
*evaluation
/me makes certain people appear
oh
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I won't get a raise
I need to go buy some laptops today... probably wont make it to town though...
Ever
laptops as in plural?
Since I'm only temporary until I go back to school
maybe a promotion
:P
Again, temporary
Why multiple laptops?
a temporary promotion :P
Lol
'stormy is gona be market manager
Ive bought like 7 of those
/me needs to take a shower, brb
o.O
they are awesome.
I wanna work at the music store in Reading
(red-ing)
They haven't failed me yet.
SR, why did you get 7 of the same laptops?
Because they are good.
I buy them and set them up for customers.
Ohh, for work
hers is really slow though
sr is a middle man?
futureshop should give me a discount.
Anyone know where I can get a decent HMD for <$500?
whats HMD
Head Mounted Display
Preferably monocular
On like VR goggles
Sort of
Not quite
I dont know then.
do they sell vr goggles for computers?
Yes
But they aren't called VR goggles
hmm..
Search for Head Mounted Display
hmd we
awesome
I bought a beagleboard and installed a stripped version of Ubuntu on it
Can't find a good HMD for it though to carry around
...XD
Umm...
beagleboard is too expensive for me
That must have flown over my head
Gumstix is smaller
It's only $150 though
Id probably get an Arduino
having head mounted display makes me think being stuck in the virtual world and dissociating oneself from reality
of course i'm exaggerating
I saw the gumstix, but the drivers sucked and had no DVI output
they have breakout boards for that.
That ruins the purpose of a single board though
Tape em together
...
apparently
lol, yeah
Me either
Are they?
he said a few things when I came in
and then became suddenly quiet
Well I gotta get back to my model, I still suck at it...
it's all over my head
12LOL
12Just replied that second
I know AS2 and AS3.
I'm trying to find that laptop in a store where I won't have to pay for shipping
whats as3?
that one you linked to
lol yeah
Action Script 3.
oh
we don't have futureshops around here
Lol
i think it might be a futureshop exclusive
check out shopping.hp.com
I've been told it's a lot like Java.
they probably have a similar model
that would explain why I can't find it anywhere
Yes.
and I really wished I would have the time
12I wish there was something we could do
Have you ever used Java before?
I've done a little bit of Java.
heh - nothing in fact. It's just a work-weekend
I don't know if the specs are the same though
it just looks alike
Hm
brb
k
Actually, brb too
12^v^
its pretty good
mine's a dv4
I like it a lot
i like mine
except its not for much gaming
same here
but that's fine with me
I prefer console gaming anyway
lol
/me tries to drag Nick online
XD
i dunno
actually, the envy is a bit too pricy, you could probably find something with power for less
It is a nice machine.
yeah
the envy 13 is a nice little notebook
i was sorta eyeing the envy 14 coming out
i did like the concept of the slice battery
Yeah, but some of it is copy/paste with a couple things changed, because I couldn't be bothered to make a univseral function that would work for all of it.
yes the battery was done really well
you need more power for gaming.
i think they have i7 ULV now.
yeah but most of it comes from the gpu
that's exactly why he'd hate it XD
he hates duplicate code
yeah you need a good gpu too.
I learned that the hard way
:P
Well, the .swf
yeah i heard
mw2 is supprisingly light on resources
crysis is definalty more resource intensive.
but the m11 is one of a kind currently
People always ask "But how well can it play Crysis?"
crysis is a good benchmark.
Been playing around with the 3D options on CS4, it's quite cool.
It's like a meme on Engadget
yeah
Or is that just the suite name?
i dont think there are 3d options for that
you can check out something called mudbox that is a 3d image creator
it's a version of photoshop
http://megaswf.com/view/045f4e6bc376ea6f57016830821ba682.html
Can't wait for it to come out
12...
12THEY DID THAT ON PURPOSE
Oh cool
/me rampages
lambdad used brick break?
Nah, I do a bit of something, then come back to it at a later date. XD
lol
usually laptops come with 5400rpm or something.
12lol
very fast.
but not cheap.
i know
12....
there are cheap ssds out now but you can't cheap out on them
you need to pay for a good one if you want perfomance.
!reset
are there any cons to a ssd?
other than the price
:P
yaeh
mmm I think they fixed most of the problems with drive failures
aside from the price
12Oh ha ha ha-dee-haa....... ¬¬
intel has some 80gb ones
I thought you said CoD would work on my netbook
ill jsut wait for the price to come down on them
I got a RAID 0 of 4 128GB SSDs
:P
it may and again it may not
hey, I am still alive...
well....a bit at least
just need more demand.
err....yeah, still there
strong and steady
ask sr
cya
bye
bring me a slice
ha
03o.o
/me appears in a puff of logic - "Note to Self: Never go to Staples again."
haha
03but that could just be because my mom's friends with like half the employees LOL
its pretty good site.
well, we're getting everything from Corporate Express
you said there are ulv i7 didn't you?
and yes, that's really the actual name of it
I thought there was but maybe there isn't.
12I applied for a job in Staples once XD
rated at.
03speaking of jobs
hmm
03and he said he'd hire me
03to do computer work for the summer
03^
03*^^
?
Is getting hired by the local computer place a good or bad thing?
yeah
12Wow
dam...
12You just dont get jobs that way over here LOL
with mine it could be anywhere from 8-5
03that would be insanely easy
8? o.o
An hour? That's pretty poor.
thats the same with my dv6
/me hides
03well
03I applied the normal way
12yay lol!
03and didn't hear back from anybody
12Ah..
03she's currently at a golf outing with my sister
My gateway's battery is shot.
The closest I've got to a job is fixing the a standalone network at my old high school.
fair nuff
03and apparently one of my sister's friend's dads was talking to her
03about using summer interns
you english-speaking people would call this "Vitamin R" then ;)
(Mr. Kwar... please don't send the Grade 10s to fix it when it breaks... call me. Before I have to rebuild it all...)
Normal batteries should last 5-8 hours. A good battery lasts 10, and a really great battery lasts 12. Poor batteries are less then 5
Or at least that's how it is in my mind
ok
R stands for "R"elations
03XD
03since she's a psycho-logist
03she knows like, everybody
Unless you are talking netbook
Theres a lot of i3 laptops out there now.
Then get an i3

Lol.
03same
03which is why I refused to apply for a job at a grocery store
Hehe
lol no, none of those pictures are me
03I don't want to bag groceries or whatever
03that's just boring and tedious
lol
03I was like hmm, a job at somewhere like Best Buy or Radio Shack would be fine
/me hides
03of course they never called me >_>
03LOL
Also, PR and HR jobs would mean I can't swear when something annoying/bad happens. :P
03I don't swear though
03so I don't care about htt
03*that
Yeah, the profile picture is totally me
drf: rejected by Best Buy?
I walk around wearing a chain-mail bra all the time
lol
...
My main problem is I'm a through and through techie... when morons bring me a computer to fix, and I need to clear virii becuase of their browsing habits... I usually spend about an hour swearing continuously. All of which are not repetitive. :P
It was sarcasm dude
You did?
03Brother, yeah >_>
XD
03I'm probably too good for them
/me runs
LOL
D:
03I really hate Best Buy as a store, they bait-and-switch their customers
XD
03thre are lots of articles about it on slashdot and such
inb4: Worst Buy
03where they sell you crappy computers, then make you pay to make them 'faster'
03which is them just putting MORE software on it
and then you'd be a instrument of their evil? :p
its the interwebs... there are no such things as gurls here
03but if I got a job at Best Buy, I'd probably just ask to sell TVs or something
03and not computers
Unless their name ends in 'a'
03I WANTED to be a Geek Squad technician
lol thats the same thing i said to her when we met
03I probably know as much if not more than any of those people
03but eh
7my cat is sat directly behind my chair whining for food but I can't move or I'll break her leg...
03sadly without certification, everyone thinks you're a n00b

I was trying to think of a sarcastic way to answer "how loves spyro"
/topic #spyrochat
oh XD
it's hard to mock things like that

Next time that happens we should all go, "No! Spyro sucks!" or something
:P
Hahaha
we should
we have to tell all the regulars that
I'll put it in the topic
XD
"Shut up about Spyro; no one cares."
XD
02o_O
heya
it's more honest
"So don't bother asking. Kthxbai"

12DDDDDDD:

12o.o
oO
12MINGER LOL D:
7Eh?
12o...k?
!define minger
-!- An unattractive person (of either sex)
12O.O
7o3o
7Huh.
a I allowed to bite the auctioneer?
/me flys over and bites the guy's head off
and I mean them
12lolz
12wait
12is it a he?
/me dies
12I'll tell you why!
12we're racist like that >:|
12(Idk actually)
they don't want you to ship anywhere else.
simple.
12ah
12So of course, I didn't bother buying it
Well you can ask me. I've got a pretty good idea why
12I'm sorry but it only cost me like.. £3 to send a figure to America..
around 5 Euros here

12ol
12*Lol
12o.o
12I do not believe shipping to other countries is really THAT expensive for Americans, is it..?
always seems to me "the land of the Free" is the most racist land in the world. Sadly
=D
7The previews for the sub-galleries (Mixes, recolors, animations, custom), are different. O_o
I mean - the plush: US $59,99
12I changed them
Mrr
the shipping: US $39,99
7Ag.
7Ah*
12We get taxed too
Still
12Thats why I don't believe it's all that expensive
/me stays curled around Kirara
murr
12LOl
/me is stuck in the middle
Cute x3
12o3o
and that's why I take a look on the parcel how much the seller originally paid for shipping, call the money back and send the correct amount for goods and shipping back
:3
/me HIDE
12*HIDES
12I hate to say it but it's always when we buy from America as well D:
12Buy from anywhere else and they charge you acceptable shipping costs, UNLESS they're selling like an iPod or whatever for 99p, then they have the shipping at £50 LOL
7Speaking of all this, the Giratina figure's on its way, right?
NEEDS MORE SEX.
12I'll let you know when it's on it's way
and regarding taxes. Do you know mow much of my monthly income is taken from me through taxes without me buying a single piece? 43% of my entire income!
7Okay.
XD
No I mean
12lol
Did you not see in color once?
12So it amounts to more like 60-70%

does he get in here through different names?
Yeah, he tries to evade bans all the time
we catch him pretty fast though.
This is the first time he's been able to stay for more than half a second
Because he finally figured out his host was banned and used a different one
talking shit about people?
03who, Jessie?
Yeah
07zzz
12I don't even know her name because I dont care
03XD

/me runs
03LOL no
12Yeh but
She was just talking to him

Before I noticed he was there
12The thing I don't like about her is that she tries to act like Cari
Oh i see.
My bad.
I was just talking to him yeah
03yeah
12and ok lol
The thing about him, hes got a problem
03at least Kari is still on the show

12Err
12Last I knew she left because of having a babdy
12*baby LOL.
I remember when he was first banned
He kept coming in here trying to apologize
I said "im not unbanning you"
then he says, "well then Fu** you!"
and starts bitching.

03yep
12I never really did like wolfie.
03and Kari is there
12I could be a bit behind then, I haven';t watched it in like a year
03maybe she's back?
03ah
03I know the girl you're talking about, but Kari is definitely still there
And he's never bugged me again

03the only episodes she's in that I recorded are the reruns from like a year ago XD
12XD
03and ask why some of my recordings are being copy protected
03as that's stupidly annoying, the fact that I can't cut the commercials or anything
is he the only one trying to get unbanned?
But Ayumi/Jamez is the most frequent

Hello all, it's Apoc again
I decided to call myself Zharaal because Darkspace is one of my favourite bands
*Zhaaral
Eh
I don't remember that
:D
:P
I'm great
That's good
show last night was amazinggg
I got a few videos of it too
Excellent
I wrote some more lyrics today
I've suddenly developed some bizarre obsession with "The Void"
7Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
Thats awful, tbh
:/
Key Features:
Intel Pentium 4 3GHz processor

12Seeya all!
03bye
12the rotation has been announced
07o3o
hello
12:(
12actually they only are taking 4 sets out XD
07lol
07i saw that
07o3o
12do you know how bad this is going to be dude? XD
12unown g goes out
07o3o
12unown g goes out
12SP loses its best tech to machamp
12i don't even think its possible to beat machamp with SP without unown G
12well its possible they can play toxic tank tech but still
/me sits all over Obsi
whats up?
Nothing much
Just listening to Darkspace
After killing myself with BFMV
I am rerendering concert footage :)
Okay
/me floofs all over Obsi
Then why did you listen to them? :P
07stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuffs
It's like Tokio Hotel's Humanoid
I don't mind Tokio Hotel, I used to be obsessed but I got over them
Zimmer 483 wasn't a bad album
ARG!
lol
*suicide*
LOL SR likes JB
Hahahaha
LOLno
He looks 12 at least
I don't get it
:P
There's no way he's 16
nvm :P
XD
duhhh
Well, they're both the same age...
:O
...XDDD
ummm
hmm
I must consider getting that album
tsoaf is like really hard to find
I still haven't found the first album anywhere
I have the first
where on earth did you find it o_o
Filestube
I don't buy the albums first time, just in case I don't like it
oh I meant hard copys
Eh
buying it online is cheating :P
That's how I got AC
Although I bought Diary of Dreams' Dream Collector in South Africa
It has a rather interesting collection of remixes
I don't like buying CDs online unless it's physically impossible to buy one in the store, i.e. one without a record label thus they're not allowed to sell them
That sucks
I got DoD at the store. Ordering anything online in SA is generally a bad idea
03hi
02argh D:
02hiya DRF
okay?
02I wanna go out nsomewhere
03o
03*oh

03I was just lazy and waited
My engrish are delishuss
02I was hoping I could go to LL's

02since LL's is within walking distance from my house

It's very difficult to find DoD anywhere

/me sneakily steals a bit of Arti's curry
Haha.
/me then hides
hopefully Ryft doesn't have to stay banned for a month
:(
Ayumi came into SF, finally worked out that his hostname was banned.
12-v-
12Just try that in person lol
14I'd call that pretty damn good
14Why? XD
But came in with the same name he got banned on last night, and got banned again.
12No I'm being sarcastic
:(
He'd listen to you
:P
llots how can u call that good
o.o
Since he adopted you and Ryft :P
Eh, those pictures don't bother me
...We know
Thanks
14Wow... ysome of you here are really into stupidly high powered comps >>
They used to though, then I just stopped caring
"UNBAN MY BROTHER RYFTAGE D;"
80GB is nothing though. :o
zhaaral I don't think any of us care
14THAT'S WHY I HAVE EXTERNALS HELLO
And so's 512MB RAM.
14>>
External is much slower.
14RAM Can be upgraded
Or ChanServ
I'm kind of excited hearing about ryft coming up here for college maybe I'll run into him at shows XD
ChanServ probably cares
Then whhy do you complain about it?
Care that Zhaaral isn't bothered by SpyroxCynder porn?
14and Pentium 4 3GHz processor
Or any sort really
Zhaaral: Because we can?
O
I'm not bothered by it
/me puts Aero in Jaws 3D
14<prince-dari> External is much slower. <<<< Not really
If you don't care about it, don't talk about it
OMFG!!!!!!!
When did I say I don't care about it?
zhaaral that is really hypocritical of you
Yeah it is. I've used external before.
Exactly
:P
You're doing the exact same thign
you complain about a lot of things
*ting
*thing
Fail
14Meh
Heheheheh
14They work fine for me

03can you text emails?
12I can just email from my phone lol

03so can I
14FEAT IN FLAMES!?!?!?!?!
03but can you put an email address into the recipient field of a text message?
12I've never tried because I just email when I want to email.....
When did it ever work?
03wwell
03*well
03it's a workaround I discovered >:P
14That's total win
03Every phone has an email address if it does texting
03and it doesn't count as international;
03so my unlimited texting can do it
03email yourself
03um

use quotes
/me is sad thinking about something now :<
12How come it doesn't require quotes for just C:\ ?
Where is everybody?
it only looks at the first word unless the whole thing is specified as a string with quotes
/me crawls under Sneas
any path without spaces works, but soon as there are spaces you need quotes
12Now it's not doing anything.
Damn, I shouldn't have had the curry
Apoc, like the Matrix person?
um
Hey, Aic.
:P
12Double or singe qoutes?
No, why, have you?
'start "C:\Program Files\"' minus ''
then do cd Pro tab
no but stacey did and apparently she's friends with eleni and jamie right now on there
I looked at her page :'D
and it should work
12It should work without having to cd shouldn't it??
dunno
http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100001138286749&ref=ts
Was it hysterical/
I do it with cd
12Ok
12cd
12Oops
12LOL
LOL
cd.. is parent folder
She really /is/some kind of creep, I guess.
Yeah/
Cool, me too
12Still doesn';t work XD
cd is current directory?
http://www.emp-online.co.uk/bin/shop.php?rubrik=bodymenu&Sucheintrag=Gothic+coat&list_sort=gd&prog=search&tc=SEARCH&stat=yes I want this coat
:P
cd is change directory
12Run a batch file that kills any open Winamps then re-opens it
12Sounds pointless I know but it's for the radio
And she likes Twilight
Glee sucks
7she looks like someone's brother in year 8 at my school
Where's the batch file?
LOL
12It needs to switch playlists, and I could just have a file that loads the playlist but Winamp has to restart for the song requestor to update
xD
7it's kinda scary, in fact
12Desktop
Called?
iCarly??? Ugh
12Why... does it matter..?
03bbs
03xD
hahahaahahaaahah I always put 1990 too
People write wrong birth years all the time.
...
12I'm running the batch file directly off the desktop
12Then it OPENS Cmd and runs the commands
13/14
7yeah, but considering Hail is a furry 'mated' with Basil, it takes on a slightly creepy twist
She is?
Basil?
12If i tell it to start C:\Program Files it can't find it
02cya :P
ew
WTF Hail
7yeah. isn't he like 18?
Basil Fawlty XD
Something like that
o.O
7am I the ONLY one having Ayumi/Yahoo flashbacks?
What's with all the pedophiles here?
try "C:\Program Files\"?
12I did Ovo
MJ is here?
shouldn't make a difference but cmd is strange
Shit!
12I know >v<
12Yes
12It is supposed to open the location though
didn't one of the kids that said he touched him fess up that he lied shortly after he died?
:P
Well at least it wasn't Ian Huntley
12Yes, just like it opens C:\ in explorer
I might just leave.
I hardly use it
Start "Starts a separate window to run a specified program or command."
I use it since I hate using phones and texting.
My Myspace hasn't been used in months
12Hmm, why does it work for C:\ then?
Got it.
might be that C:\ default points to explorer but the others have no such association
I still go on MS even though no one really contacts me on it except for bands
Start explorer.exe "C:\Program Files"
12Ahh
12Lets try that
It works for me.
I just tried it.
12Awesome
12Yes!
12Thanks!
No problem. :)
hahahahahaaahah yeah
Hey Brother. :D
how's charmander girl doing?

12Ok I have a Winamp problem now :>
12Can't open a play list and have it start playing the songs automatically
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEtzhAt5_bo
12It just opens Winamp and does nothing
If not. ^
that's stupid
12I know it's annoying
Mine's been doing that for a VERY long time
I can't figure out why
same
12It didn't used to..?
omg hahhahahahaha
7Dari: they say they banned loads of episodes but hardly any of them actually were. the only one that was ACTUALLY banned was the on where ash is threatened with a gun
i just downloaded it last month, and i hardly use it XD
They never bothered to make it into English. :P
It used to play normally, idk why it's messed up now
12Yes
hahahhahaha he grabs his honkers
This one was banned, oherwise why is it only in Japanese?
7Apoc: no, because people were being shot at with a gun.
7Dari: I said HARDLY any were banned
12Sec
k
Yeah, well.
125,56
03EW
Hold on let me check mine
03get 2.91
12That movie is gay
03wtf
7get out
Kindle.
03he told me it was really good
12Because you're going to watch it
12:DDD
03...
03LOL
I agree with Arti on that one
xDDD
lol
The gay part I mean
03oh you're nice :P
12LOL
7Neon: they edited out all the guns in yu-gi-oh, that's why TAS takes the piss out of invisible guns
I remember that I first heard about that film something like 3 years ago.
12Hello.
12I checked MY version of Winamp rather than the Servers
12It's 5.57
Oh for God's sake
TAS?
7the abdridged series
Oh.
as is mine
12Ohh..
blarg
Maybe it's the version blah
That must be an interesting thing to see, invisible guns
12Must be, it just loaded fine on 5.56
12right time to downgrade
12Oh frick >v<
12this is going to be a RIGHT pain
03go get 2.91
12No..?
12Why shoud I? 5 is fine
03no, it sucks
032.91 FTW
7they just point
12Why does it suck?
12It plays music doesnt it?
Right
but anyway gone again
I'm using 5.56
03LOL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1dO9f4oZ7s&feature=related
hahahhaahahahahaaaha
I've had NO problems with it
12No?
03LOL
03fail
^
12It opens, it plays.. WOW
The only difference is supported media files to be honest
and auto-tagging
03not to mention 2.91 can play IMF files from old DOS games :)
and a few other niggles that i need
03and the newer ones don't
tis called plugins
03orlyt
03-t
o.O
in a sick way
:'D
03it's a plugin for 2.91 also
03yes you do...
03it comes with it
12You can just deselect like EVEYRTHING
03then why install it at all?
ugh, my nephew is spazzing about getting HG for his birthday v.v
032.91 also opens and plays music :P
12You install the player..
03LOL
03I just go to oldversion.com and click 2.91, download
03it's like two more clicks
12Yeh but.. whats the point?
03because I like 2.91
12and I like 5? Ok?>
12I didnt install all the rubbish on it
03LOL
03I use the 2.91 theme :P
Pointless arguements are fun
/me hides
well I downgraded to 5.56 and it didn't fix it
/me eats Alt|food =3
D:
12.....
14LOL
>_<

well it happens with any fil
12I'm already reinstalling 5.56 xD

Hope yours works lol
k gone
12Byes

.worms >>
12I have epic RSI -v-
12worms are cool
I was raped by an ogre.
there's nothing good with worms thou D:
He had three eyes, and was in a wheelchair.
The rest is history.
12....
I have to take a poor tasting medcine because of them
12Earthworms are cool then
lol yeah
Of course, I was horribly drunk
wait... you have worms, Brother? O.o
I've had them, might have them again
the ones that eat you
tape worms?
Yes
eww
*poor
I just hope they arent coming out
O.o;;;
umm... let's drop te subject, I just ate....
TimeShift: in a way that they eat their way out of me
not the 'other way'
they usually don't
Hmm, thats odd
which
hey brother, how the heck did you get tape worms? Did you eat raw meat or something?
wait wait wait...
i thought that you only got it if you wate raw meat
*ate
/me doesn't want salad ever again now o.o;;
well, usually animals like cows and pigs get it
eggs leave their bodies the "backdoor" - and the dung is used to fertilize the fields. For salad, corn or whatever
on harvest, some of this dung remains on the plants, salad and corn - and with it the eggs
eww
that makes me never want to eat eggs or salad ever again
14xD
theres worse Aero XD
please don'
*don't
Pay no mind, no one special here...
12How is everyone?
my appitite is lost for supper now, thank you very much v.v
on average
..... ok ok
enough.... please
i'm gonna be ill....
They must not be plugged in.
knew that already.....
bugs are gross
*gasps*
I live!
12Nooo
12They're awesome
12TimeShift, by the way that is just a myth
12The swallowing bugs thing....
i'm gonna go.......
no, it's just a statistic
bbl
same goes for the chocolate - insect leg - thing
12For one, not everyone sleeps with their mouth open
12and whaat?
12XD
12what chocolate thing?
you eat insect legs
12Read it
12yes that is very believable considering I saw some insect legs at a restaurant
I think
12Just one over here somewhere
12That was the most disgusting thing I've EVER seen..
"welcome to the Just one over here somewhere resturant, We'll feed you food :D"
I know something even more disgusting
12...
12Do i really want to hear this? XD
a woman was in a jungle and "bitten" by a spider. It was painful, but she thought it was okay
12.....uh oh
Hello
a week ago i saw a bee being eaten by a huge spider, it was awesome
hi
12Ovo
12POOR BEE LOL
12......................
12LOOOOOOOOOL
haha wtf
12i'm gonna be sick XD
12Is that really real..?
ironically that was the first instance i saw large amounts of blood, and birth
It was lulzworthy.
and I was..what 5
*at me

7This is an interesting discussion here/
12XD
/me 7gives Arti a platypus
12thanks
/me chews it
12XD
I called one of his friends name Jaron Juh-ron instead of Jair-on. xD
XD
*named Jaron
wow
INFA Z :D
12I throw them out all the time
hey
kill it XD
zup
But after he corrected me, i insisted on saying Juh-ron even more.
7Squish.
I killed one yesterday
hahahahahaah
12You lot are cruel :/
I get mosquitoes all the time and kill them XD
12You can get pet locusts..
/me hides
7They give lots of protein! :D
7(And yes, people do eat them.)
12You know it annoys me that if people talk about killing anything other than invertebrates, everyone goes mad..
7O3o
dam... cant slap people on this computer...
7Eh?
Well I am angry how he keeps bringing up religion. I thought Spyro22 was the problem
mhm
XD
Arti: depends
What's wrong with people bringing up religion?
I wouldn't be mad at him for his beliefs but just the fact that he's a missionary like you said
12Ovo;
You can bring up atheism, can't you?
I don't have a problem with it normally, but he brings it in every conversation.
^that
i beleive the subject should be taboo in the forums as its just going to bring up unessesary drama
No, not really unless you enjoyed it
7Common perception of insects?
it actaully is
I don't have a problem with people talking about their religion but with people like him that bring it up in every little thing it starts to get on my nerves
You're not supposed to talk about sexuality, politics, or religion on the forums
12Brother speak for yourself, anyone else would tell me to stop talking about such a horrible thing
Although I hate that rule because I feel it's unnecessary censorship
12Omg I know
12it's the best quote ever
I don't care if people bring up religion
I don't see a problem with it
I get 10 a week
He technically took that rule down, just not physically.
7o3o
Yeah I don't have a problem either...but the fact that it's still a "forum rule" I try not to let it happen I guess
Yesterday he said it's not a real rule, and he meant to take it off a while ago.
To be honest, I'm pretty sure SR couldn't care less how the forum is run
good point...
I dont mind flies though
That's why I like SR
whereas spiders are just chillin?
He doesn't exactly moderate it much
he said the other day he was "thinking about taking away that rule"
12Self defence is just differnet to killing something because you don't like it
12-v- lies lol
14Spiders are awesome
People have good suggestions, but nothing ever comes of them because SR doesn't give a crap
Lol
That's why I want to make my own forum
And why RDX made his
12Ok
12It's taken me ALL this time
cool
and has it worked?
:P
Bueno
I'm doing good
Just won a robotics competition
12Im currently playing the wrong playlist ¬¬
o.o
I'm waiting for videos to pop up from the show last night and I'll post mine soon :D I was in the very front

some telemarketers are calling me and i'm not in the phonebook
I did all my job applications on this computer
because I always claim myself as a "Independant Contractor"

never call yourself an employee.
Can't be an independent contractor working at Walmart
But for some jobs you can.
yeah.. course you dont have regulations being independent i dont tihnk
Country and 80s.

Completely different years though
Its like, a stripped down version of lego/knex

I think we sold them all
Or maybe they're hidden somewhere in Evan's closet
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsWFFuYZYI

the 8bit movie
Knex are actually used in education.
its pretty incredible
Woah

Nowhere near as cool as that though
Stop motion is awesome

Pretty much all my online friends are here
03EW IPHONE
02o_O
03my Droid can open links >:P
02never tried
02I've only tried a dual boot system
03orly
02but that COULD work
03you just said you can't
Yep
I can confirm that
just don't wanna login
02but it'd eat up ram and yeah
03...
03LOL fail
02wb
More like public RSS feeds...
-I
I don't like Twitter
03Well, it has more RAM
Its the same idea...
And Twitter seems really pointless to me
03fail
just a really stripped down simple version.
02ah
03'that's why you pick passwords that you can remember
02desktop*
02it says 512mb on the VMware one

02because VMware keeps getting screwed when there's too much activity
02and hai n2
*all
XD
Lol
That's why I turned autocorrect off
Don't you have... A server hosted already?
hihi
i dont see the point of it
Non-youtube link:
http://current.com/shows/supernews/89891774_twouble-with-twitters.htm
HAY
what's up
03We are colorful peoplez. :3
02xD
03that's why I just don't use devices that don't have keyboards?
03-?
020,9At least it's not this, n2
02XD
Can't you just forward the port?
:)
I don't know, how do you do that?
its a router block.
Let me find the port forwarding site...
Nah, my parents do it intentionally
03nah
03iPhones just plain suck, period
http://portforward.com/
that's also why I haven't been on spyroforum lately
parents blocked it
you just plain suck
Lol
Its a block put into the router for web access, its only blocking port 80.
Eh, that's not bad, Armaggedon.
13This, on the other hand...
04back
I don't get it though; it used to block everything
IRC too
04back
Why only port 80?
Proprietary software or hardware just plain sucks
/me runs
They don't want us on websites I guess
04AEROOOOOOOOOOOOO
But there are literally thousands of ports...
/me glompw
04glomps*
I'm finallyyyyyy back from projects
aerooooooooobar
/me clings to Aero
hello aero-d
Well yeah
pooooost
/me licks Aero
Port 80 is regular web traffic.
bah :(
04wut
you know, you guys are gonna make me go back into scripting
/me enters in a puff of illogic
I think the only reason they didn't block 6667 too is because they don't know about it
it's https
uses a different port
https is 443
07EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
04lol
5xD
Lol
04scripts
I'm just glad I don't need to worry about networking until I take the Cisco classes next year XD
04are cool
02XD
02And I told him I wasn't and he goes
02that's fine, CR xD
02"You just FEEL Asian"
02it shows like 13this to me
You worry about networking when you have a networking problem.
02it's purple
02XD
The only networking I have to worry about is getting around my parents' stupid restrictions
03pink to me
And fun
I know enough about networking to fix common problems
02Pink to me too
02battle? xD
02Glacymr's Server?
02I want to try xD
And he doesn't like when I ask questions about it because he thinks I'll use the knowledge to get around his blocks
Yeah
He's a manager now
Maybe he left default password on the router config? XD
Works for Cargil
Aww.
I've tried
/me fears the competition
I hate IT workers. They never answer you directly and always say "Just let me handle that"
02I don't care about competition
XD
02I just want to have fun xD
Buffer overflow!
02I lose all the time and I don't really care
He'd kill me if he ever found out
Bye me :D
Then don't let him find out...
He would
Don't antiviruses find keyloggers?
Couldn't you just temporarily plug directly into the modem?
04I lose all the time
04and idc
PM
04I mean
04I really suck
04like
04REALLY
Somebody say something.
no
:/
8D
The easiest way would just be to put a pen the hole that resets the router to factory defaults. XD
HAI
O
I was just checking if I took that ping timeout on my touch
HAI
it's obedience and disobedience at the same time!
02lol
...
But mostly obedience.
02you've beaten me twice I think
Yeeeeeeeees
I best be leaving now.
02please? D:
Indubitiably, inasmuch the pseudo-complexity of this verbose bantering holds thespian value.
A sawyer commented upon my eristic attitude, I have to say that his comment, while malapert, is correct.
02all right hn
02:D
02you know the server etc. right? :3
02I'm waiting xD
Anyway, see you all tomorrow.

Oh, that's strange.

Oh yeah, I am.
02RAAAAAAAAAAAAGE
02HOW DARE FORUMOTIONS
XDD
04?
04what happened?
THEY ADDED RETARDED <censored> TO OUR AFFILIATES
There's lots of lurkers on SF. O_o
04what did they add?
I bet it's all in the terms and conditions you agreed to without reading.
:P
02true, dari
02I deleted their module
02and made a custom module just then
02so hopefully THAT fixes the retarded problem
Add the voice flag for *!*@*
/cs flags #channel +v *!*@* ?
Well, I was more specific
:P
Fine, draw.
02lolwut
OK, fine
:P
XD
+V
04wut
+v - Enables use of the voice/devoice commands. +V - Enables automatic voice.
get the lid off
:o
Hail is turning 11
02Shiny, lol, remember http://ho-ohrealm.forumotion.net/administration-announcements-f30/new-site-ideas-t319.htm ?
Wow
/me shudders...
grrrrr
hahahha did you ever get an invite from her yet??? I haven't
02Yes lol
Me either
Did I tell you about how she found me on Neopets once?
02Oh look
no
02Forumotions now has multi-themes
*where
.-.
Make...lookups?
Then somehow she found out it was me
Layouts for people's profiles
02:O
Ahh.
02It does? D:
02Yup
I had some fun doing that last summer
02http://help.forumotion.com/updates-and-new-features-f1/users-tuesday-tip-add-multi-themes-to-your-forum-by-darren-t71484.htm
Did they pay you in neopoints or something.
No
I just did it for fun
Oh.
Trying that now
02o_O
Nopw
Which one didn't work?
All of them
I autovoice using flags in my channel
04Vote for my xat suggestion!! http://util.xat.com/vote/story.php?title=new-user-status
Should work
/cs flags #channel +v *!*@*
I can C/P in this Client
02apparently you could always do that
I think that's the right syntax
MOUNTAIN DEW
WTH is xat?
BITCHES
02but we never needed to, did we?
02I LIKE MOUNTAIN DEW
+V
not +v
3 MOUNTAIN DEW IS GODS CUM
Two entirely different flags
02o.o
And actually, the mode comes last
Hehe, that too :3
*!*@*, then the mode
I get this
Anyway, WTH is xat?
04well vote for this one 0.o: http://util.xat.com/vote/story.php?title=me-command
02._.
02I should spam filter that
Usage: FLAGS #channelname [target] [flags]
Yeah, that's because I typed it wrong
it should be
/cs flags #channel *!*@* +v
+V +V +V +V +V
xD
But I'm pretty sure it worked for me with +v
+v allows people to have access to voice/devoice commands
Hmm
Maybe I should fix that
!devoice
!voice
!unvoice
lol
Hmm
How do I make it list the flags?
Actually
!deop
You have +o set for *!*@*
Just a minute ago
Okay...it says they were set
/cs flags #channel <------ to list
Hm

14Er
14Wrong
14XD
02Shadow Ball + STAB
02with Gengar's sp atk and speed
04Giratina Normal forme is a wall
02it depends
04Giratina Origin Forme...I don't know. An attacker?
14My Giratina one hit KO'd Gengar
14Shadow Force 8D
04give Gengar protect
/me shot

hello...
hrm, do you think he got the point here now? http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5570.0
-he +she
uhhhh
04its a sweeper
02yeah
02max speed is 306
02and then with that, 198 sp atk but with light ball it'd be 396
02it's basically out in 1 hit
04lol
02meaning 398 sp atk
02with light ball
02but you could probably get a support team for it
02with tailwind
02to speed bump
02or get ninjask or similar
02after a few turns of speed boost
02and sp atk boost
02then it'd be the ultimate killing machine
04lol
02at that rate it'd sweep a whole team
14nice post lol
04pwnage

12They're all like 50+ Ovo
12Also.. one thing you need to know about England.. you DONT make friends with neighbours..
orly
http://www.kno.com/the-kno.html
12No Ovo
(I have BBQ's w/ neighbors.)
12Weird
12Should I say "Unusual"
Heh, one more reason not to move to the UK ^^'
12They keep to themselves
12BF
I don't live in the country. :<
12But we;re not "friends", we dont go to each other's houses or go out together.....
6hello?
12No thats just an England thing
12Only in very unusual cases do neighbours actually get along enough to be like best friends or something!
12We're sensible
12and things get personal, and then you're stuck with it
I'll keep that in mind then...
12Ok take this for an example
12But me and Xai already figured it out :/
12I think my parents just took them for granted because of being friends....
That is just commen decency, sorry to say...
mrr
kick it down
035:18 remaining
7No prob's. ;3
12I think you should just keep personal things away from neighbours.
14I agree with Arti tbh
Sneas
Can I has PM help?
14I've had a few problems with neighbours when things get personal (heh still do in fact)
12D:
14I tend to be social towards neighbours and nothing more
14Thunderstorm is here
12Lucky, still not here
I don't like Americans at all >> But that is just me personally... anyway, that is off the conversation

12No I mean you just said you don't like Americans, not America
If I move anywhere for long term, it would be Australia

12Like they have in China..?
12Internet is restricted
They don't have that in Australia as far as I know ovO
12Yes they do
We know a couple of people that moved there ^^'
12How long ago?
A few months ago
was the last time I talked to them, but they have been there for about 2 years ^^'
I guess there might be one, but not as bad as China
12No but getting there
6is any one on?
6like right now?
I need to read up on that, since I know why CHina do that, but why would Australia...?
6Spyro Rocks i THINK i need ur help
12Well, why would England >v>
6uhhh
child prawn and terrorists
Because you have strange politicians...
14Anti-Piracy crap
12Actually it may be slightly different here
12It's money here

Hello?
gud
XD
/me pounces an Espeon.
am I still connected?
no, you've been kicked from the server
lol
ok, that was scary...
/me 14yawns.
I hate when pages have the dialouge boxes that don't let you leave the page
14same here. Hate those. ~.=.~
They're more to the west, I think
I like Europe
I kind of doubt the UK has more tornadoes than the US though
Nice and clean
For one thing, the US has way more surface area
Tornado Alley included!
Exactly.
Yeah
Minnesota
14You have to realize it's all about climate. In the UK, you got the chilled weather from the east, and the warm sea air from the west.
Apoc, source?
I believe Apoc
14It's the same thing like Tornado alley.
I'm usually skeptical
Ugh, now I have to remember
Doesn't really matter though
*outside
We got nothing
But heat
/me paws back at Espeon tail.
14since*
Thunderstorms
Tornado + Oil Spill + Match = Awesome
+ BP executives being thrown in
And very dangerous
Tornadoes don't appear at sea =P
Other wise it is called something else
*water
14Just storms and Typhoons...and Hurricanes.
Exactly
I am angry at BP
/me wiggles
14Who isnt?
my family lives in that area
Not to mention all the wildlife that's being harmed
Anyone think about nuking the oil spill?
14I heard somewhere that because of it 70 Pelicans died, but they saved 60. >>
I'm sure it's a lot more than 70
Why not nuke the oil spill?
http://dvice.com/archives/2010/06/nuking-the-oil.php
The spill has been going on for more than a month
14It's growing that for sure.
14They just recently capped it and it is looking like it is working.
Well, that's good
We must nuke it!
uhh... no
14No...too close.
Aww...
14and a Stupid Idea.
Nukes solve everything though!
No man, no problem!
War solves all man's problems: No man, no problem.
As if it's not poisoned enough by the oil
H-bomb?
14You basically do that, you have a risk of killing and poisoning more...you're creating more of a problem
Anything radioactive is bad
14Indeed.
Back!
Pay no mind, no one special here...
12Hello, everyone.
Hey!

14I'd like to see you withstand one of those Warhead being detonated with you standing on the coast. >.=.>
You wanna know why?
hey Proto
nothing
lol
Because everyone knows that you can't explode yourself underwater
You're using the wrong definition of ego...
And yes, I did use bad grammar
UK FTW!
I don't know about /banning/ them, but I think people should use more reusable bad
*bags
Oh wiat
*wait
Sometimes these stores make me buy reusable bags, I just throw them out when I get ome.

He lived about 20 minutes away from me

Don't let him find me here
12Yeh ok
/me wiggle
03I guess it's just the hair
/me gives Kipikipo a head of lettuce
03I'm just saying

Nah
12Yeh well, you've said it enough times :>
7turn into Hail, just to scare the crap outta people
03k
:o
12But to be honest thats one of my fav photos
12Thats why it's on my TST profile
03yeah
03I just think the long curly hair looks cool
12Yeh I like having curly hair..
12I can still do that at this length
03so why'd you straighten it, work?
7ah
12I dont straighten it XD
12It's just like that
7of course, it could be said he's already killing you considering it's him that told me to join SC
03oh
03oh XD
03my sisters have to use straightening irons on theirs
12Er.. like nearly all of them
Oh, that's how you got here
12Mine's just naturally straight
:o
/me eats it
I'll have to pay him back for that one
03heh
:D
03so do you intentionally curly it then?
12Yes
12XD
03ah
03k
weeeeeee, swiveling!
12But..
03so XD
12My mum used to do it for me D:
03I actually got a haircut yesterday
12I can't do it myself D:
/me places a special hat on top of Stormy's head to make her feel special
03which of course is complete BS
12LOL
03she's such an idiot
:D
12LOOOL
03"You're dressing up, you should shave"
03I'm like
03what if I wanted a beard?
03that's my choice, isn't it?
12LMAO
03nobody said dressed up has to be clean shaven, right?
Prove it!
^_^
I think I have 61
:P
Byes
HA!...but most of mine is family
I deleted a lot of people I don't talk to though
I should but I wont, I'd feel guilty
I just remember that they probably only added me to make themselves seem more popular
Add as many friends as possible
03hm
03I'm probably freaking out over nothing... but I've never had like a normal 9-5 job
xD
what's that?
03and somehow I'm thinking I'm not gonna be able to do anything besides work for the rest of the summer...
:D
/me hugs Espeon :)
12Well
I'll ask him
You do that
:O
I have evil schemes?
INTPs don't have evil schemes
12I come in, logon to computer and phone, answer calls from frantic doctors about their software not working properly, fix it and fix any other problems on our "list" in between calls, some people just open tickets online instead of calling us
You're thinking of INTJs
:3
Haha
03hm
03so it's more of a desk thing?
12Yes
03I'm hoping I'll get to do that too
03all I know is it's for a computer company
12Late shift is a bit different
03hm
http://typelogic.com/intj.html
12But it only comes a few times a year
03well I probably won't have 'lunch' breaks
12Why??
03that goes til noon
12Ovo
03so I won't even start work til then
12So no 9-5 tyhen?
03so I'll just get lunch before coming in
12*9-5
03well
12*then
12XD
03it'll be 9-5 for the next... 2 weeks
12Ahh
03I'll probably just eat lunch before coming in
xD
03if they don't have some sort of cafe there I'll go a day without food
Hey Fresh_Blood, stop hating me.
:D
It worked!
Told you
03I'm probably freaking out about nothing, right?
03I mean, the summer camp job was fun because I was actually doing something I liked
12Everyone does on their first 9-5
:D
12I mean everyone panics right before they start
12It takes some time to get used to
03ah
03OK
12It was horrible, but.. intensive training was worth it I guess, now I'm a pro :>
03XD
03I'm just panicking right now
03because I start tomorrow
03I'm HOPING it's actually getting to work on computers
03I know their company does all sorts of things
03from servicing computers to selling them
03if they have me install software or something
03that'll be fine
03I guess that's the other reason I'm freaking out
03so it could be anything, really :/
12DRF it's ok, I felt the same way, I was literally starting from 0 knowledge of the software I had to work with and the procedures in doctor's surgeries
03OK
12Me too..
03I guess I'll just have to find out tomorrow
03what I'm in for
03I mean
03the only good thing
03is money XD
and work experience
03eh
03well yes experience, but if it's doing computer work
03that's kinda trivial to me anyway
12Im fine thanks, really need to get up off the computer though
03as I'm good on it
03... LOL
I find people end up in the most interesting places
that's good to hear arrti.

03though I can do epic cannonballs
12But mostly I go walking.
5I think swimming's okay.
5I prefer walking or jogging.
7Meh, swimming.
03walking is boring unless you're actually going somewhere
12and you definitely need light to go walking in hills
5Or biking~!
03why walk?
7Overexposure to it made it boring. :/
03I'm more of a practical person
Yeah same with Arti o.o
03why do something if it's not really accomplishing anything?
12Walking IS practical
5Wow DRF. xD
03orly
7Your health?
12Erm
12For fun?
03eh
03my fun involves computers :P
12Thats like saying why are you on TST? XD
5Walking = Practical because it keeps you alive because it promotes healthiness?
03as for exersize, if I WERE to, I'd just use the treadmill
03as then I Could watch TV at the same time :LP
03-L
12Lame
03how is that lame?
5Arti, I do that. xDD
03there's really nothign to do outside
12I don't know how you don't get depressed staying indoors, I can't go a single day without stepping outside
12No he doesn't Quan
03I don't find meaningless walking fun
12He doesn't like animals or nature XD
03no I don't
5But I get out plenty.

12Well yes but I don't even use DA >v<

6if you have a sub, you wont see a problem
12Ok lol
6but again
6I don't mind it like everyone else
03I see no use for DA anymore

12All you said is if I have a sub I wont see it
2that episode was epic
03you have to go back to the search engine
/me 2rewatches
6to restate in clear words
drf: some people just want to search where ever they want
12Yes but whats this "Old Way" of viewing things as you say..?
03to restate in clear words: people are retards
03that answers most questions
though its just an inconvience for me

03People as a whole are incredibly stupid

12and
03Magic Memory Sticks only need to have MagicGate
03that's the only requirement
03so yeah, you should be fine
03you *will* have to erase it though, just to let you know
ok
12back
maybe i should just buy one then
03eh
03you just need an official Memory Stick, that's all
03don't buy a "Magic Memory STick', they charge you extra LOL
03Ic an give you the program to do it yourself
03AMazon.
03or just use the one you have
03and you should be fine
how do i do that
03um
oh ok thanks
It worked fine yesterday, and now it only loads every other page
Hi!
Hmm
/me finds using proxies very unreliable
It's the only way I can get to Spyroforum
Does it work for GPX+ too?
It /did/
It's probably just too far away
It's his IP
you can do that?
Doesn't explain why it worked last night though...
You can use another person's IP?
apparently
I don't know how it was set up, but it works without having to go through my dad's network
that way you can gain access to certain blocked content without it showing up on that network
I don't trust proxies
03LOL I just misheard this song
03as "Never ever wearing any clothes"
03I don't think that's how it's supposed to go
all it takes is the right person to break it down
But they still had to go through the router here
12o.o
12wait
everything has to go through the router yeah
12I'm NOT! :o
/me shot
03:O!
03PIX OR GTFO
/me runs
yeah, or else it would never got online at all
/me GTFOs
meow :<
03D:
/me has exams this week D:
Well yeah, but this one must not go through my connection at home
oh great my moms like "isnt hacking illegal?" and blah, blah, blah
Or all the blocked sites would still be blocked
And I don't think I'm gonna do well in Spanish... :(
/me has them in a few weeks...
03XD
03tell her it's for homebrew
03that's legal :P
12but I have one on Tuesday ;3;
but the router is seeing it as a connection to a different source that is hiding SF
lol
i alrdy play ds games on my comp
aka someone can find out if you're using one
no but he would still see it as a betrayal of trust of sorts lol
Yeah, he would
Back!
12wb~
I don't get it though; if it still shows spyroforum.com in the address bar, and it goes through this router, why doesn't it get blocked?
I've used proxies before that don't encode the URL and they still get blocked
it's hiding it under a false address
and IP
simply attempting to deceive the router
12O3O;
12good luck...
basically
it's just masking http cod
e
I'm not very familiar with how it works via router protocol
hey
but in essence it's just trying to deceive the router
Hai
and it's not doing that anymore
helloooooo :D
so is it blocking the site or not?
No
Thanks~
Oh and my speaking is on wensday
wanna see it?
Actually no
hahahahhaha yes!
and I think the rest of my spanish is thursday

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY-Z4kVWm1Q&playnext_from=TL&videos=Z1Ve0buMDlE&feature=sub
you can't access it though
you can't access the actual url that is spyroforum.com
and yes I know we spelt "unofficial" wrong
However when to the actual site "Wesbsite blocked by netgear firewall"
That's probably it
yeah, because it lets you on past 10:30
it's port 808 on SR's IP address
Haha, thanks
XD
:P

I still have two weeks to be heureux.
Why only two weeks?
That's when the heureux ends. :/
Basically, it when my best friends leaves for the army for four years.
*friend
that sucks
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that
It's okay.
he'll still be able to talk to you online though, right?
Yeah, luckily, since he's doing a form of ROTC in which he does online college classes.
Ohh, he's gonna be an officer?
Yeah, by the end of it.
Be sure to always salute him from now on then
:P
At first he was going to do school here (on the military's dime) and then serve as an officer, but he hastily signed something.
:P
Ha
I knew a few kids that talked about joining the army
Oh, really? Did they do it?

5Has anyone else died in the movies?
Nu

5Mrah.

Lucarios: ys

12I tear up at the end EVERY TIME ;.;
I'v only seen heroes once in my lifetime when I was 8.

14-something +human
12Firstly..

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58FcsLm2rjk
^ 'Destroyed'.
Nice wording.
03A fox attacked a baby?
/me runs
12It must have been open for a while if they claimed a fox got in!
O.o
14attacked 2 9-month old babies @drf
/me pokes Espeon :)
03same diff
03I was more after the Xai joke
/me runs
14lol
12The only explanation for something like that is either a REALLY odd fox or a rabid one Ovo
/me shot
6my guess was rabid
12Nope
121. They would have mentioned that, 2. Rabies is practically extinct in the UK
12It's very very very very rare
12Well I've never heard of it!
14^
Babies are different though?
12Yes, but still
14Fox's generally run from humans anyway
14No matter the size ovo
12It's just dodgy
6um...

12Dunno why?
12How long ago?

/me moans happily, eager to be pleased~
/me smiles
exactly why i said that
hmm...
/me trills loudly as she is filled, rubbing all over Ari's body as thanks
:o
/me starts thrusting inside her, pressing his body against her tightly as he thrusts
/me faps to this
/me shot
/me :O
/me psychically massages along Light_Latias's body, inside and out, thrusting hard inside her
/me is being rubbed with a psychic pussy and mrrs
/me leans down and kisses Light_Latias's lips passionately, sliding his tongue around inside her mouth, thrusting hard
I still wouldn't
XD
And then like baby baby baby YESSSSSSSSS
Not "baby baby baby noooo"
/me humps into the psychic force holding his member. Because of the pleasure LL's getting, the force deminishes slightly, but atill has enouh of it there for him to thrust into~
Eh
That would be horrifying
I sure hope not
D:
/me rawrs
Yeah it owuld

We're not having roommates dude

/me runs
That's stupid :(
Because we go to a Catholic school
XD

All the more reason to be roommates

I don't think even secular schools would allow that
12night Slash~
03"0'x" <-- looks like a face
03but it actually shows that
nah me neither
We're actually both Catholic by the way :P
but it makes the rule make even more sense
/me faps.
03for some reason before and after commercials, the captions become random jibberish >_>
Probably
/me sees this going on and drools, also faping
030'x
Haha
03er
And I go to a community college
I bet it is
mine is just a dummy community college
Which has to legally be secular
03040'x
it really isn't that religious at all
/me runs
its college.. id figure not
03brb
after that it's like any other college
/me helps Caaz's fapping the same way she is helping Chimera~
*religous

Hahahaah
But barely any of them do
Well you matter

Nah, Shanahan did
12beats me
Oh right
*One of mine did
One
/me cums into the psychic pussy |3~
One, none, what's the difference?
Haha
the difference is one
/me psychically multiplies Light_Latias's pleasure, holding her tighter as he thrusts harder, sending an overwhelming amount of pleasure into Light_Latias's body as he thrusts
/me doesn't completely fail at math
:P
I wish my school was more secular :(
Lotta pleasure XD
I'm like the only non-Christian at my school D:

03back
SR made fun of that for weeks
I actually don't mind Wiccan as much as other religions
I am NOT a performer
/me tries not to get into his anti-religion rant
/me smirks
I've probably heard most of it before
I decided not to go to the same school after spending a week programming robots there and not liking it for the dorms, CS program, and food
12wb
:3
I don't like ranting about it because it usually does bother people
:3
My turn?
Either that or I'm preaching to the choir
/me hides |3
ironic statement there
:P
I feel the same way
/me nods
it's just like another religion the way I look at it
/me blushes deeprly

and I couldn't care less if somebody doesn't share my religion
12just once each toni-ok
12if you and him go at it at the same time, thats ok
kk
Now when people start making assumptions about my intelligence because I happen to have a religion, then I don't like it as much
i dont mind people stating their beleifs its just when they start putting down other people thinking that their religion is responsible for war and all that crap i get a bit irritated
I haven't come across that O.o
:O
/me hides
he does do that
Indirectly hints at religious people being primitive all the time
No X3
Religion doesn't cause war, people cause war :3

/me goes to play plaitnum!
14platinum*
14sfa
14f
14as
coz now that he's giving a warning is kind of freaking me out maybe if he's a part of them he's saying another attack's on the way
and i still don't fully understand the battle system XD
14haha
well i don't fully understand
well tell SR see if he has anything to say about it
*gauge
12I havent had the patience to go through that bloomin lolcano
I knew he should've stayed banned though srsly :\ something about him has always kinda bothered me
14Stark Mountain? XD
12Yeh whatever it is
14The one with Heatran
12Yes
14EWWWWWWWWWWWW
14DBZ BT2
14GET IT
12That is the most annoying cave I've EVER been in
i don't have a PS2
14I didn't have a problem with it
14ovo
:3
12It's the way it's laid out
14D:
14I didn't have a problem with it
14:P
why do you hate 3? XD
:(
14Because it fails compared to 2
can't you be more specific?
14The only problem I had was the wild encounters XD
14The battle system sucks
on 3 when it's for the wii has online play
14The abilities are fail
12Thats why I use repels but not even those seem to last me when I'm in that stupid place
14Compared to DBZ BT2
dari it was different for the mods than it was the members remember they took profiles of [censored] on all the mods it scared me
I've only played both of those a little and that's enough for me to side with LLOTS on this xD
He didn't care.
well
Also I went and screwed up their site loads, and they got nothing on me.
the fact still remains
i don't have a PS2 lol
14I don't use repels lol
14Well I do
14When I use the PokeRadar
12Does it work in caves?
14Is Budokai 3
14The Radar?
i remember Budokai 3
i have to agree
12Yeh
14No it doesn't
Those images don't work.
I tried them on their site.
14lol
But why would they post here?
12http://captain-okita.deviantart.com/art/Shadow-Lugia-166925804
12IT'S FINALLY COMPLETE XD
12WOW

14I STILL WANT A BELDUM ><
03BT2 = best
12I really think they messed up on the type of material though
14Sneas
14:P
/me p[censored] out hugs and creeps back under his bridge -- I MEAN, erm, back outside
14B3 was more interesting
14The fusions weren't permanent
14the transformations weren't seperate characters all the time
14The battling was harder and more fun
/me eyerolls
lol
14brb phone

it was more realistic
05Nya. Hiya all.

12:D
12Y'alright?
14HI
05Mhm.

/me sits all over Leafwing
12:>
07EXPLODE!
/me giggles, licking Kyu's cheek.
05I don't do that much anymore.
07D:
05Sorry o.o I don't think Tiger's are meant to explode
05.. Oooh. I broke 'em.
Yeah, the ones I told you about. That's why the fiction section was clean when you came back but everything else was still writhe with spam
/me plops over here
You have to inform Rurik too
since he can monitor all sections
I wanted to keep individual mods to their sections
omg are you guys attacked then too?
hmm
no
spam bots got hold of the site when we abandoned it
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcmy3uNZDSE
12That is awesome..
maybe i should get it
12I think (from the photo) that the fins and tummy are the wrong colour :/
and now that I'm watching over it again you can tell me also
07o3o
12But aside from those... it's amazing
12It's probably one of the best costumes I've EVER seen
12How much?
hi

12Thats a bit cheap..
Cool Hwhip.

Meow

Congratulations everyone, we've broke the record of most users online at any one time with a whopping 12 users woooo
on the forum?
yes
and yes it would be a good idea
Yeah
it's more then last time
That
14LOL
Which I believe was 8 but I cant be sure
We need a bigger community lol
Well technically 3:29 but :P
I know
@FB
@Dari: Have any suggestions I'm open
12back
I have an idea that isn't an option lol
I don't know how you get it to move up, and there lies the problem.
o//
hm
Bloatedfish - y :D
Maybe the more times a term is searched, and that link is clicked?
The solution is simple really
when I'm not revising, yar
hehe
05Ugh. Stupid computer.
I like Dinosaur Comics, although in a weird way it always feels like it's the same joke over and over.
Well, you're first on the list when I search draconic wolves. :P
XD
well their is encoding you can place in the http that helps bring up those words that people search
Such as pronz
I'm pretty sure I hit it pretty good with most of the words that involve our site
an active site is worth paying for lol
Except that doesnt mean you can introduce paid memberships!
when i see a topatoco link i'm like zomg comics
http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html
yar
And, no Dari, I dont think that'd attract the right members, I'd rather not sift through the countless of mature fictions to moderate them, most mature fiction is utter bobbins lol
I'll admit I'm not familliar with any of the others on the list, but I'll totally check them out once exams are done.
hihi o//

it seems like the only time it would work is during the weekend
yeah
75% ge doesn't care, 15% he hates me, and 10% he's my friend
There's only one conclusion

ogod
03yeah LOL
It's because of rushed product.
03that was quite good'
My father likes the toumb raider movie. The first, that is. He says the rest suck.
Tomb*
03LOL toumb
Don't diss the Brits here, drf
Arti is one.
also, who's going to see The Last Airbender purely to see how much they screw it up?
03I know
At least she lives in England.
lolbrits
03so Ic an make fun of her all I want
/me hides
squeak
03<Absol> also, who's going to see The Last Airbender purely to see how much they screw it up? <-- me LOL
03I mean
12lol drf
03M. Night Shamalan (sp) makes good movies
03but I have a bad feeling about Avatar TLA
killed it
I just want it to.
I WANT TO BELIEVE
/me runs
12Quilly! :D
Yeah
03XD
That's it
03well
/me cuddles~
03the trailer for that movie looked pretty epic, TBH
/me squeaks "heya"
03I saw it in front of PoP
I really want it to be good. I loved the animated series as a 10 year old.
I wmat it to succeed, badly.
03I actually need tow atch the series
03I pirated the entire show on DVD
03I just need to watch it all
Want*
03I only saw the first few episodes when it premiered
03then I missed some
03and therefore never bothered to watch more
Yo
03since you need to watch them in order
which one?
03well
the first trailer
or th 2n
03when I first heard about Transformers, the movie
oh no
03I thought it would suck
03but it was really good
03so eh
I didn't quite care enough about Tranformers
Is paramount known for lazy oversight?
whenever The-Shadow-Dragon comes, Scaily usually comes later
12o-o
Uh oh
I still say they're going to screw up the Avatar movie
yes
but only because its trailer sucks
I took it off
just pretend we aren't there
03I know movie studios for different reasons
well the 'current' one
we can ambush Scaily
03like, which ones encrypt DVDs and which don't
/me runs
I think the trailer us decent.
Um... Anyone there?
03it was
03I saw it in theaters
Hehehe, it's working
or showing the battle of the north?
/me pokes Light_Lati
03um
03I don't remember o.o
03there's more than one?
hmm..
03and honestly
the one with the candles at first?
like with the epic voice at the beginning?
03I really don't like knowing lots of details about movies
03I like just walking in there knowing nothing about it
Stromy?
03I'm more impressed that way
03XD
anything they create into a movie, they'll just kill most of its actual story
03like some trailers suck
03they give away the plot
*say
lol
yes?
03XD
Oh
Stormy*
look at that
03I mean, some trailers are epic.
he's asking for you
03Like the one for Watchmen
03it's my all-time favorite trailer
like clash of ttians?
03the one with the Smashing Pumpkins song
03as it has lots of footage but doesn't tell you anything about the movie
Oh, shoot
03also the one for Harry Potter 5
Scaily only cares if you're there
03that trailer was awesome too
shouldn't have said anything
make him think I'm gone
Just wondering if anyone was here
stromy
4+=1423.27.254=+ <drfsupercenter> 03the one with the Smashing Pumpkins song <-- epicly specific
pastromy
nightall
03Absol, well, there were 3 trailers for Watchmen
03so that specifies :P
Stromboli
lol
tell him you about to go to sleep anyway
Haven't they heard of /whois though?
part*
probably not
not everyone is versed in the way of irc
I doubt they even know it exists
03LOL\
Oh haha...
12o3o
03you know
/me runs
03I also made the joke
03the tagline for the movie
03"Who watches the watchmen?"
03I respond "Um, me?"
/me hides
I've seen about a sixth of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WagTMqdsktg
but Scaily and someone had similar hostmasks
Um?
03guys are all "zomfg nudity <3" when it's girls... but you put any male nudity in a movie and people are all "EWW GROSS"
03I really didn't mind, not that I'm gay, I just ... didn't look there :P
03and I mean
03would YOU wear clothes? XD
no
That's a good point
neither
Yes.
03People just complained waaaaay too much about that
XD
03like "OMFG NAKED GUY"
03I was like meh, get over it
03it's only a total of a couple minutes anyway
03he has a speedo on most of it :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4blSrZvPhU
03yes, that
03most epic trailer ever, right>? :P
o.O
where did the nick alert come from?
No idea
Didn't you say that it alerts you?
Hm

And that doesn't make the noise
And I just heard it again

SR always quits and rejoins

I know
My spyrochat tab flashed; I thought it was Scaily

That's my region.
turns out to be SR
Hahaha
:O
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
one of his many doppelgangers

sr is really a furry!
!weather 76021
*gasp*
ew

78? Feels like 86 XD
03fail
12!weather 12590
That's likely because of the humidity.
12its cool here~
03today's weather was nice
03it was like 68
03good for cutting the grass
NY is not cool though
it would kick him off his nick in 30 seconds I bet
/me hides
03I was only a *little* sweaty XD
since he's oper now
oh yeah
03oh wow
Hmm
i bet hes got his name locked down
03there's a TV channel called WOmen?
03That is not sexist at all
I don't know if mine is
it'd be sexist if they called it
/me muses about combining BET with Women, you'd get one super-exclusive racist and sexist channel!
lol
woMEN
/me runs
:p
XD
I was just going to see if you wanted to do that
03WOMEN
w00t!
03but it shows *everything* that way
03like NICKELODEON
WOMEN
03etc
03XD
12lolz
03HECK YES
03I mean
03hi
hmm
7N00b!
03also
12o3o

12...
oh no, I'll be logged out in 15 minutes
Hm
/me faceclaws
odd
03I use my computer to watch TV
Speaking of n00bs, why is Kja's registered?
D:
03WTF?!!
Yes it is
03there's a movie called Unmade Beds
03WHO NAMES A MOVIE THAT
Why is yours registered?
12o.o
WHUT
I don't know, but I hate when we swap names.
*annoying
kja just has that sorta authority...apperently...
it'll kick you off his
Maybe it has something to do with the time it was registered?
I don't know
maybe
that makes sense
like registration used to do that and now it doesn't anymore
After all, according to his DOX he is a high-ranking member in SpyroForum.
that makes sense
:P
A spy!]
:o
:O
Imagine that.
/me restrains drf.
/me sneezes in Brother's face
that must be it
Can't wait until we fully-develop this excuse to get rid of him.
...wait for it
Stay on target...
here it comes
boom
how weird
wait, actually
RDX's nick didn't used to do that
you should ask him next time he's on
I impersonated him once
o.O
How long ago was that?
The*
When we both switched names and made fun of each other
Like last year
I'm proper like that :p
hmm
Nu
maybe he wasn't registered yet
No is the correct word
Get it right.
oh right
12Laa?
yeah
I don't think RDX even does
man... i want a pizza..
I tried asking him about it once
lol
I think we asked him once
Infamouz: don't we all?
I just thought it was some oper thing
Then Kja has it
o.O
I'll stay for another 30
Me too. Only the sleeper agents would deliver me pizza at this hour.
12Laa?
Then I'll join brother in dreamland.

Hey Rurik.
Heya pplz~
xxx
It feels weird to not be at school at this time of day :D
sex!
Hello~
12post
12nah just kidding
lol
12how are you
I'm pretty excited 'cause I'm having my graduation ceremony today :D
Now it's on the first page, but still about 50 places down.
hi Quilava
hi
how did you manage that lol
12yayz
12seems like every TST member is graduating this year
Little trick I found.
which is
Man, it's 40 degrees here XD
That cold?
:)
Cold? WTF you on Arrak, the Sun?
whats up?
tk.
7 up
:)
you?
I searched "Dragons and wolves forum".
Oh, you men 40 degrees CELSIUS
no
I thought you meant FAHRENHEIT XD
too bad.
I got it second on the page
I have 100 terms per page.
Which is why I said it was first page, but about 50 down.
well it's second down on mine
Yes...Because you have more like 20 terms per page.
tk.
Which means that before it was on page 4/5.
o.o
For you, anyway.
why do you have 100 links per page
.o.
I went on advanced search, and specified 100 links per page, because it's quicker to see where the forum is listed.
anyway how are all
oEo
wait how did you get there
Just 3 topics in the spam forum.
Yup
i dunno lets hope nothing unfortunate happened
ya
SF has a 3
I guess we'll see soon enough :3
06.....
huh?
ok that sounded
awkward
xD
you think?
>:
yes for various reasons
/me hugs ^-^
Still 1, probably means it's just ahead of other sites with 1.
06...woah Aero's here :)
Yesh~
advanced grade 1 lol
i didn't have any problem with it but whee
06and then I go right back to being stressed
/me doesn't think they would be able to do much anyway :P
The more links a page has on it, the less it's worth, the more links it has to it from other pages the more it's worth.
Perhaps it's one of those hormonal things with growing? O:
/me waits and sees
yeah
06x-x
awkwardness, lets hope there's nothing to see apart from fluff
06well if it's inheritable from parents, then it's very likely

/me bangs his head repeatedly on a wall
This, unfortunately, requires me to RAAAAAGE-QUIT.
Should I do it?
7it was created specifically for each sequence it was featured in. if it didn't fit, an entire department would've gotten fired
Si se puede!
Or something.
RAAAAAGE

Hello.
06....a preview for "The Incredibles" was on "Destiny Deoxys"?
06lol
I have blown up the world.
7that you secretly hoped had happened
The realization of this fact may take some time.
7:p

I must fill up the page.
Yes.
There is a cost, though.
I am sure it may or may not irritate some people.

/ignore Juffo-Wup
do you have a sugar quota
It's been a long time since I've used /ignore, but the "USA" chanting did it for me.
i never used my fury too much on bad guys
i only used it on elites and bosses
that is why they invented /ignore though
I know...but he's right, I'd feel mean then
Cant I just devoice him for a bit?
i tell u the only level i hate in dotd is the burned lands level
Curse you mibbit smilies, you make me feel guilty...
I only like the pretty forest.
Fine, type all you want, I'll just read a book or something
But it won't be the same.
twilight forest?
that was a good level
and i like valley of avalar
Fresh_Blood?
the daytime one
burned lands was too long
Yes?
daytime forest.

/me slaps Cerberus with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
but*
/me highly doubts it
Meh
Spyro has sucked since it stopped being a platformer
Technically it still is a platformer...
But Blizzard is taking it over
LoS is a platformer?
/me 7pokes Articuno|AFK D:
Technically it is...
hai Quan
It seems more like a hack-and-slash to me...
7Hey, Aero.
comination i guess
not really its more action
It is under the category of platformer.
how's you?
I personally only liked the first 3 games, ANB, and DOTD
Suddenly?
Most websites
Hm
Yeah, suddenly
ahh
06ugh
06I need food
7Hey, Rora.
Spyro has sucked since the start of the LoS series
:P
06but I don't wanna walk all the way downstairs
:)
7O3o
06my legs and arms and abs are like jello right now
wait blizzard is taking it now?
Yes
hmm
yah
well thats no good
And ever since, all the games pouring out are completely awesome.
Well all I know about Blizzard is they do WoW
really?
And since I've never played WoW, that doesn't tell me anything
Yeah
But those were made a while ago
my brother in an adict of wow...
I use to play it...
7Unzipped, it's 500.
the only thing i really watch him do on there is fight really important bosses
But I didn't care for the price
lol
it's just never interested me much
i'm not addicted to alcohol cause i dont really like it that much
wow or alcohol
WoW
lol
I plan to drink when I'm old enough
Lol no
I'm not going to drink when I reach 21
fail
that is not the right answer
I HAEV PARTEE
i graduate in two hours
12I like adult parties.
hm?
there a drunk hitting on you stromy?
I don't think he's drunk though lol
does he work there?
Yes
Aww, he's growling in his sleep
you cant really have relationships with other employees i dont think
And unfortunately, I'm going to have to work in his team from now on
:D
XD
XD
XD
He's dweaming
lol
thats an awesome idea
And Infamouz, you can have relationships with other employees, but only if one doesn't have influence over the other
if lamdbda would have that sort of disposition
...
I came in at the wrong time...
lol why?
hmm i thought i saw something in there about something like that
It sucks though
Infamouz, I was told you were...
hm?
Because I could have at least avoided him if they didn't realize I was supposed to be in setup
traitors :P
wha?
I didn't say anything
just me
:D
XD
coz I'm the coolest
:O
Unwillingly...
:P
NO, he's in high school
*No
!define Apotheosis
-!- ideal: model of excellence or perfection of a kind; one having no equal
If I am 40 years old... Then why would I say I'm not going to drink when I become 21?

/me runs
06lol
i dont know if i might be of any help though as i am just starting
hm?
/me has to go redownload uTorrent
hmm
Torque3D
never heard of it
Like the Source engine, Unreal engine, Unity engine, etc.
4hk
ok
4OMG IT'S RAINY
3d isnt my sort of thing though.. thats along the line of SR
:O
4literally
Hey :)
yeah
He doesn't seem like the person willing to help
he showed me some of his work and hes decent
03LOL, "If you're going to kill yourself, do it off campus, because it's a buttload of paperwork"
He did that 3D model of Spyro that's the current contest on the forum
hes got his own things to do
06LOL
I doubt he'd help you though
He helps when he feels like it
And that's not very often
id like to learn 3d but i dont have the time or motivation to do that
Plus my speeds suck today
like 332
nor money at the moment
ping timeout
He's on #epic-chat
is he homeschooled or something?
Yes
epic-chat and of course all the oper channels
But not his own channel
Where is the model he posted?
Announcements
Don't ask me why he put a contest there =/
how does torquq work anyway?
03wwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Found the model...
03LOL, theme song after an entire 6 minutes
03that's a long time
That's... Decent?
Hi
03Hi :3
12SNEAS
o.O
03AZURE :3
12XD
03Yay x3
Looks exactly like Spyro to me
Hmm...
exactly how he appears in the games
i think he ripped the model from somewhere
Well yea, but you can see the triangles, the grass isn't volumetric...
12Yus :3
12All that I need to do when I'm done with it, is cut it apart and code it.
12XD
XD
12Ok
About to do Calculus
12I'm done
03:3!

lol
I dunno
03NOW TO DISSECT IT AND REABBEMBLE IT.

03reassemble
Me too
/me runz
Well just be glad he's not here
03no
XD
i never seen him do much out of the way
When was this?
but nothing more than the typical annoyance that comes in here
12XD
Didn't we have this discussion before?
I am getting deja vu...
If we did, I wasn't around
i dont remember it
But yeah, he annoys me too

/me hides
You say something, and then you think "Ohh crap, he's going to get angry".
4http://verydemotivational.com/2010/05/31/demotivational-posters-ladies/
Then he doesn't
And then the opposite happens and you think "He won't be offended"
After we kicked him out of here for flipping out at us for correcting his chatspeak, I found out he'd made 3 accounts
03That's awesome :o
And he starts getting angry at you
12Ty :D
Spyro1,2,3ftw, Spyro1,2,3ftw!!! and :O
he has like a few thousand dollars worth of software in 3d imagetry i would think he would display something with it
12xD
xD
No
He pirates
really?
Yea
Yeah, SR pirates
He used to be really touchy about it too
everyone pirates duhhh
He posted where he got Torque3D online, a $1000 piece of software
*ships
I made a joke about it once and he was /pissed/
12OH WAIT
Because it would ruin his reputation or something
12I need to make a styleswitcher button
12D:

I've lost a lot of respect for him over certain things
Pirating is one of them
yep
yeah, I remember that thread
06....ffff I forgot how creepy regirock is in the 8th movie
Then he PMed me and said that if I say something like that again I would be banned
Apple fanboy?
Far from it, I don't like everything Apple does
Seemed like it from that argument you were having
Ooo, th ebest bit of the twilight film
Sure, I like Macs and I like iPods... But everything else? No thanks
Like it looked like you were slightly offended when SR said Apple computers were "effeminate"
mac has more than macs and ipods?
lol
iPads
aw man
That's not much else
:P
jeez
son of a
Earphones, MobileMe
Yeah, but those are minor
4the end?
Look, everyone likes iPods, and I like one other Apple product
No, the bit where they play baseball
It's not the fact that you like them
4......
Also, I don't care for iPods myself
I didn't bring up the fight
I like ipods nothing else
i like my sansa
it was a pretty heated argument
Post a link please? It was a long time ago
I can't get on SF
lol she has been banned
lol
which I doubt
Wait... Then how do you remember "effeminate"?
And now that that bit is over, time to continue channel surfing
I don't even remember it!
...
It stood out to me because it's such a stupid thing to be offended about
Okay, let me just find this thread again...
no infa z because it's an apple and apple is for vegetarians
and vegetarian men are gay
:P
thus making macs effeminate
XD
Okay...
I just took that completely out of context
Wait a second
Of course I would be offended by an effeminate comment!
...
The /computers/ are effeminate
Ohh
Good (relative) evening people.
youd just be effeminate by association :P
:P
Wow...
I'll have to look at the thread again when I can get access to SF
But I'm pretty it was clear SR meant the computers, not the users

12Wheee~
Nah

He's been defying the no religion rule since we first put it up
Not that I care at all
14:>
"We" didn't make the rule, SR did
yeah..
Ohh, now I remember why I was angry at SR!
I never liked it
he's thinking of taking it down though
Well good
About freaking time
It offended me because he took it out of context
I do
Only when I'm angry though

That'll keep you awake
That movie is terrible
Until you're done
lol ive seen that on g4
It's even worse than the book
Then you'll fall RIGHT asleep
/me RUNS!
And that's saying a lot

I'll probably see it for the sake of criticism
/me shot
But I won't pay the full theater ticket price for it

Just rent it when it's like a dollar
And Stephenie Meyer won't make any money off it

Although it's /hilarious/ to watch on film
The only thing I dont like about this film is Bella's little naratives she does from time to time
/me licks :3

14:o where be you licking ;3
12O:
I dont think about it that much, I just watch
12Wing?
/me shot
14:P
I tried to go into it with an open mind, and I couldn't take the movie seriously at all
/me licks Azure's wing back then :)
The acting and special effects are both horrible
X3
And those are things they could have fixed, unlike SMeyer's story
/me ruuuns
Fresh_Blood, I know, I just like ranting
Also... why are they having the summit in Huntsville of all places?
Yes well excuse me if I dont listen or comment, it's nothing personal lol
12O:
And if the summit is in Huntsville why did they close of downtown Toronto?
That's no problem
12Oh u
/me runs
14XD
And LoS critic
x3
:P
you dont really bring that up near as much as twilight
I barely ever bring up Twilight
Only when someone else mentions it
Well I actually like LoS but i'm not going to argue about that either.
i see you bring it up everynow and then
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard all the criticisms before anyway
/me meeeps X33
03iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
12X3
14<3
Mhmm, and I pay them no mind. Everyone has their own opinion but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone would like to hear it lol
03lulz
Exactly
i like [censored]ins
deal with it
12:3
I only enter a discussion if they ask for my opinion, then they'll inevitably tell me their's, then there'd be a rebuttle and then I'd lose interest lol
If someone likes or dislikes something I don't, I don't care
You can't really criticise an opinion though
yeah you can
I just did with Twilight
You can try to persuade them otherwise
But not criticise an actual opinion
That is the "actual opinion"
I criticised that
/me runs
06>_>
I only said the baseball part was good
But I still criticized it
The rest is passable
Well you said it was decent then
You didnt actually criticise the baseball lol
12Cya!
Now we're going in circles and I politely request a change of subject.
Night~! <3
It;'s ok
03bye
lol
I don't get how it's going in circles, but OK
?
Lol?
brb, food's ready

That'd be more a drink though, surely?
some people can eat it
in the philipines they put it in flour and roll it up into a dumpling
or as they call it "chocolate meat"

I read yours as Fay-vor-right
lol
Hahahaha
^_^
send that to him.

It's my language anyway! lol
I don't get how not having an extra letter in there makes the pronunciation like that
You;re just abusing it
I'll let you do it
/me is poked
Yus? :3
He'll be home any minute lol
Quite a few of our words have a u after an o
I know
12Nothing, nothing
12xD
And I've never understood it
Lik Oestrogen
:P
thats awesome
(At least it works. Unlike hippies. :P )
/me sniffs more :3
And that looks like it would be pronounced "o EE strogen"
BLLLLLAAAASSSSSSTTTTTOOOOOOIIIIIIISSSSS
03py
its not even money.
nah, it's because we're practical and efficient
We don't put in unnecessary letters

12Pfft

I played pokeman for a little while.
I didnt actually play it, ujust collected the cards.
the thing was as large as a magazine
Now I have tons of cards because a kid I babysit gave me about 60 of them
12but then I thought of how to solve it immediately after
12So yeah
12|D
i had a lot
"thanks for playing with me" *hands me a ton of cards*
I remember trying to counterfeit the cards.
/me shrugs
lol i got a venasaur card still have it around somewhere
o.o
The u makes the uh sound at the end of the word
No
Like in Armour
Because you need the extra letter for the extra syllable
it has to do with color tints
X3
or something
its flour here and armor as well
armour is a company i think
that makes potted meat and vienna sausage
XD
Or Favour
i dunno i just say you english people are all kinds a f'ed up and leave it at that :P
Because that would make them "coloor," "armoor," "humoor," and "favoor"
Teletypes get really annoying after a while...
you should call it american
its a dialect not annother language
It's still the same language
Just a different dialect
Not officially, but between ourselves
12x33
if you go to germany, one side cannot under stand each other even though they speak the same language
I hate it when they use the foil on the cards
its too hard to copy.
but they both speak english
(Namely, my ASR-33 is a bit... annoying. Output faster!)
Nevar!
(And also, be more quiet!)
ya still have a queen?
:P
Lol, monarchy
That said I cant understand the welsh sometimes
How do I tell if it's counterfeit?
different tints and shades on the pictures
just seperate some tints into sepreate piles there should be 2 kinds
I canny do eet! I dun 'ave the powar!
Hmm
Well if LLOTS won't do anything...
I got some Japanese ones
/me x3
I can not do it. I dont have the power! <<<< Scot
I don't get why they say "Pocket Monsters" on the back
isnt that europe?
"Pocket Monsters Card Game"
But it's Japan
poke= poket mon=monsters
They should write it in Japanese like it's the rest of the card
Well yeah I know that
and yeah youre kinda being loud
12O:
I just don't know why the back of the card is English when the front is Japanese
go to a mcdonalds and buy the biggest cheeseburger you can for half a pound
12OKAY
and feed our american economy
50p wont buy a burger
12Now I'm done with the layout
And even then that burger is tiny
it's too hard to tell the different tints
12I need to figure out how to freaking code it
12D|
/me does not want

quids?
03XD
12XD
Yeah
12I do
Bucks?
12My way
12but
i don't remember which one's counterfeit lighter or darker
12Since Tiel coded it differently
12I can't
12xD
but one set would be counterfeit
probably lighter
12Lol
12Licking me is enough to kill you?
/me runs

They did that for a very limited time over here and then took them away. Before that I had to go to america which is where I first tried one
*avoids
ive had a hamburger in the philippines and it tastes weird
12But then it might mess it up
12or perhaps make me even more confusedf

12xD

The script has a limit of 30
Well, wait
does the script limit include external client users?
12:D
No
12wb
:)
The network limit is about 200
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff :(
wait, this network is limited to just a meager 200?
At the moment
I mean, the script itself has a limit of 30. No more than 30 people can use the client at once.
More specifically, no more than 30 people can connect to the network using that script
ouch
I can always increase the limit
but there is no per channel basis?
Correct :)
:(
let the battle for bedspace commence!
Why stuck with mibbit?
Why do you need a channel limit?
for any channel
not just 1
Let me put it another way
wat.
You're not going to run into any problems with the user limit for the webchat
and I can direct this webchat widget to direct my members to a specific channel?
Yes

brb
And you have no intrest in her now
it's reallllly bad for anyone to think that way
It is
For one person to be the center of their universe
I do, but i am fearing for my own sanity
Neo?
Neotyguy
No, she's literally saying "zzz"
03o.o
Oh, him
apperently he is working on a videogame
o.O
ZEE ZEE ZEE
/me 2feels alone
2hi rp4l
03O.o
5Hi guys.
2how is?
12O.o
5Oh, okay.
12o.O
^-^
12:3
2good :)
yeah
2Sock puppet
7O3o
2I loved War Machine
I saw it a month ago
03only alright?
03I thought it was awesome
but all i know is that it is similar to sculpting i guess
5Really DRF?
03yes
5I thought it was predictable. =/
I had to see it when I saw war machine in it.
for the past 2 months now I have been trying to work with her on getting her to think about things more
5Didn't quite keep me on my toes like the first one.
*fault
5I thought the basic premise was very "meh".
12o.o
honestly, I am not sure
2it was still an awesome movie
every now and then I hear the "you are blowing me off"statement
Then that convinces her you are out uh...ya know
/me is paranoid...bad
5And of course Scarlett Johansen shone.
2oh yeah
Or she thinks you are really blowing her off
03chibiz.
12XD
It's called being emo ;~;
12Indeed o:
(because of paranoia)
I mean, why try to be selfish?
lol
Wait
Qui
Quanyails|Zzz: The tail is wrong D:
Hmm
which worries me because she has Celiacs disease
Why did she refuse to tell them?
if it's personal I understand, you don't have to say
"because they dont care about her"
how could pain be personal?
no idea
maybe some problem with her parents is
/me noms someone
eh, not really. just the standard over bearing catholic parents
Jesse's book of relationships says try to get her friends doing more with her
but yeah, her parents should at least care enough to help her when she's in pain
=/
«Annual» I have those kind of parents
/me o.o's
well, they might be reluctant to believe her, seeing as how she drove out to my place despite them telling her no
?
12:3
basically, if she has any food with wheat or gluten, she can die
Oh wow
/me huggles back X3
5I just realized something. I had an epiphany. Eureka. Et cetera, et cetera.

/me is currently obsessed with drawing chibis
12o.o

03oh wow
03the one my computer's on
12|D
03luckily I have a battery backup
not that I want to break up with her, I just feel I might have to, in an effort to protect myself
5xD Wow.
12xDD
HO-LY-CRAAAAAAAP
AZRE
5EVER.
*AZURE
/me 5headdesks repeatedly
THAT PIC
OF YOU
AWESOME
12I'M TOO LAZY TO FINISH IT
12LOL
I think I know you from somewhere else...
12BUT THANKS
Or from someone else
2lol
/me tugs kyu's tail
No prob XD
12XD
Could try to help her be more healthy about the relationship
which would be really hard
How do you do that oÎ”o
12gosh darnit blasted
or could do the even harder choice that you're suggesting
12I dunno
12D:
:<
12It just happens!
12xD
How can I help her be more healthy about this?
12X3
12i don't know if it's just me
5Yuck! D:
By telling her how unhealthy it is that she looks at you as the center of the world
O__o;;
5... Um...
12this is the first time it's happened
I hate to make this suggestion
But I seriously think you two might want to talk to someone about this
Like someone professional
You can talk to me.
Oh.. professional.
5(Okay end rant. xD;;; I really needed to get that out of my system.)
lol
12hmm
That's a good idea
2lol
12i'm using a spray for spiders and roaches
I think it would really help the both of you
12but i have no idea if it'll have any effect on ticks
2*runs*
I know a lot of people don't like the idea of therapists but they can actually be really helpful if you can find a good one
well you don't have to put it like that
5(Okay, NOW end rant.)
Have the voices gone away yet?
2yeah, I think I got that journal as well
5What?
5Oh, no, not him. ^__^;;;

12nah
Either of those
Stormy's would be funnier though
12Roleplay4life
:P
12i killed the tick by flushing it down the toilet
12was put it in the microwave and videotape it XD
12and send it to those guys
well if he comes to any other channels and does this, I'll have my first excuse to use my oper rights
permissions, not rights.
Same thing
Not gline, just kill
ya well just dont kik me again
we dont use kill.
12or mail it to them and let them take care of it XD
F4LLENV4MPIRE, just don't spam again
dont spam cause it annoys people
/me kicks F4LLENV4MPIRE
5You should!
ya i know
ha
12they say you kill a tick by flushing it down the toilet
It was really frustrating
tinychat is empty:(
why don't we use kill?
A friend of mine made a parody of "Let it Blend" once...
And the result was awesome. :P
.........
Well that's the point
"Will vodka and vermouth blend?" *whirr* *drink* "Yes, and the result is a semi-good vodka martini."
:O
?
If they do it in another channel, kill as a warning
F4LLENV4MPIRE: Mod powers!
OK, you're annoying me now
/me laughs with a lack of enthusiasm
No, but about how to treat spammers
they are arguing about terminology

umm is anyone else gonna talk
hm?
SR
oh
really?
Yes
i didnt see him react
He thinks it was "revenge" for a slipup he made in another channel
it wasn't on the channel
He messaged me on gmail
then either went offline or blocked me
*else *talk
i have this wierd feeling
something in the back of my head
its talking
I don't get it
no it coulnt
I do: He's just being really emotional
but then again
He said in another channel that I "spent a lot of time in therapy" and asked if the voices had stopped yet
its alot like
"d" : )
All the while making jokes about someone who's girlfriend is possibly suicidal
huh?
And underage drinking is out of line?
its telling me to do something
When it was a joke?
something like
"spam"
it couldnt be
never
Apparently SR
SR apparently
but the voice is getting louder
and louder
and the only way i can stop it
I haven't seen him get emotional like that in a really long time
is if
it's strange

Yeah, it's not like he'll stay mad over something like this either
unless you want me to leve?
I don't know
You can never tell with him
blocking seems like pretty permanent action
It's really easy to undo
just take the name off the list
well yeah
If he's going to stay mad over something like this then that's his loss
I promise :)
yeah just dont let it eat at you

* darkcynder22 (Mibbit@cloak-39dd5b76.buckeyecom.net)
Oh yeah
totally different
never mind
I had just found it right when you asked that
I had to find the point when she quit
oh yeah
And trolls know how to annoy people
especially him
it's like she detected his weakness
and boom
I can't think of any
maybe this was all an elaborate joke by SR to make me feel like [censored]
the host is completely different
could be his friend
When pretty much no one does
look at the quit message
yep
and the default channel is epic-chat
the first one he went to
*though
I'll give him that
yeah, that threw me off too
06BREEEEE

12o_0

yeah
thats sorta odd
and saturday the first week
but only the first week for some reason
to get me used to the switch from day to night shift I assume
dont think they did that for me but oh well
lol, or maybe they just have enough employess working Saturday already or something
I overheard them say that a lot of people are leaving in the next couple weeks
aka quitting
probably vacation
oh

hope he wasnt a [censored]ey mouse
hahaha
he was pretty cool
makes the break pretty enjoyable
ugh, breaks are gonna be the worst once I start nights
i ususally bring a scetch book and draw but theres other things yuo can do too
That's a good idea actually
sometimes someone brings a gamboy annother brings a book ect
I do enjoy drawing and I don't do it enough

in fact i procrastinated the whole day as i wanted to practive drawing
*practice
never got around to it I'm guessing?

anatomy practice?

I suck at drawing humans

hi you
How are you

4Guy is the biggest [censored] ever lmao
Lol, "but you whatever you are", haha he's strange.
"Now leave my page and never return!" Rofl.
Can you explain why he considers wyverns as evil?
12What?
Another crazy dA inhabitant
How can you consider any mythical creature to be evil?
4I dunno
4he's just being a derp
4AHAHAHAHA
4he blocked me
06ra
Hmm
4*goes to other account*
Thought my phone failed then lol
You should counter his argument by saying unicorns are evil. Why does he think wyverns are evil?
07o3o
4I dunno
It doesn't mean they can't be good.
12This conversation is hilarious.
07o3o
brb
Dari: I understand, it's just that there's no basis in there that they are "good", even though morality would be a point of view. In fiction, it isn't always.
4pft
4he blocked me again
/me dies
Fresh_Blood: "There is only one lord of the rings, and he does not share power."
He didn't give a crap about them.
XD
But they were still helping him...such nice people :)
In that book, in that context you could consider them to be evil, the point is that you can change the context they're in to whatever you want it to be.
But that's just it, you can't look outside because the context can't change, or it becomes non-canon.
wth does that mean?
Sure, you can say they're good, and write about them as being good, but it doesn't affect the actual work.
That's all I'm saying.
There, context changed.
No. xD
I've put in a vlaid argument, and have nothing more to say, lol.
*valid
Context BS.
Me too :D
*theory
06http://sareii.deviantart.com/art/Haircuts-Are-for-Everyone-167167293
Not in a fixed work, like in literature.
07lol
06yeah I was being fast about it
Name one and I'll tell you.
Rodriguez the Benevolant
They also toppled the Mexican government, but we'll ignore that for now. :P
Nooo, you can't ignore it, address it!
06er
06*status
That's differen.t
That's different.*
Mornin
That's the interpretation of a context.
Evening
Exactly, which I agree with.
The only thing is, you'd need to know whether that was a real event or a fictional occurence.
They're both entirely different.
Now you're talking about fictional context for a real person?
06ok, gonna grab a bite, and then sit down and spam up the job applications
Benevolant means good
In a round-about way
You're restating my point, Dari.
If you know it's not real in a fiction book, you can take it out of its context.
I still agree.
Because the other context it is in is not real.
All I'm saying that, even though fiction is written by people with bias, it can still be exempt from a moral perspective.
Good and evil are similar in their own right, though the world makes them out to be opposites.
Good and evil are learned perspectives.
Right.
Which brings us to philosophy, I guess.
Ultimately there's no such thing.
Yeah, but that context would have no ground, since they are depicted as evil incarnate in the books. That means there's no basis for making them out to be good.
:P
I know. But if there's no evidence of that in them, how can you righfully (or otherwise) present them as that? It just doesn't make sense.
I am to say
None are correct, since dragons don't exist.
It's impossible to know.
I'm aware.
You dont exist!
Which means I can put them in either context.
*dinosaurs
donosaurs!
There still has to be a first mention of them, when the idea was conceived.
Exactly. The only difference is the origin of the work they are mentioned in first.
LOTR has a copyright, with a confirmable date. When were dragons first conceived?
Me too
:P
1953
Why does copyright matter?
Because it's law!
I'm just using that as an example, it doesn't.
YES!
Not rightfully, no.
I have this phone >>
Hate*
*isn't
Kind of a different topic. Separating a somewhat modern book for a millenia-old legend.
.-.
I don't see the difference.
Yeah, he'll have it taken off you, dari
Just as well i'll be home in 10 minutes
Both are fictional, one old, one newer.
LOL
Let the battle begin!

Why does it matter that you cannot legally create an alternative?
06stupid job app
How does law come into it?
06I hate how it asks "how did you hear about this position" and doesnt have a "walk in" option
I only brought it in because you won't give up.
xD
06I didnt hear about it, stupids
Otherwise I'd just be repeating myself.
Because I think I'm right?
I think there's an answer to it, and it's mine.
No, it's mine, all mine!
It isn't limited to that realm.
03LOL
03I always just said their website
06yeah that option was hidden...
Yes, it's possible to say they aren't, but you'd be incorrect. There's a difference between having an opinion and being wrong.
03also like
Is that a pun?
03<Aurora> http://sareii.deviantart.com/art/Haircuts-Are-for-Everyone-167167293 <-- way to put the accent the e]
/me runs
:P
Yesh! :P
03*over
I'm not wrong.
You are.
No, you're both wrong
Well, in my eyes, I'm right.
You don't have to think I am, but I want to.
That'd be the purpose of this argument, then, even though even if everyone in the world agreed with me that wouldn't make any of us right.
^ You're on the right track.
12Sneas :D
Wth is cannon?
It's a term that used to apply to religious doctrine, meaning a legitimate addition to a story.
It's NOT an addition to a story.
It is an entirely different story, as I said.
Ideas exclusive to one other idea can not be changed. Things that are incorperated into multiple ideas, such as dragons, are open to debate
Nothing to do with LotR.
Nothing at all.
We've moved past that already.
Only law says I can't.
And law has nothing to do with this argument.
12:3
Then where would you be creating this alternate wraiths?
That's why in the case of dragons and other mythical creatures we are in agreement.
I repeat, laws don't matter.
12Hi :D
14Hey :>
But they do, and their esssential to my whole argument, as it's based in a modern world with laws like this.

What's the definition of an island? Surely you are too, if it's just "land surrounded by a body of water".

And we're not exactly stranded lol

That's my point.
As are islands
if it goes meow then don't complain

If you could negate the earth's mass there would be no gravity...would the earth still orbit the sun?
/me flops on the ground
.-.
Because all mass would have to weigh something, no matter how minute the fraction.
But it's strong enough to move the earth?
14?
Right, I've had enough, not fun anymore
Hahaha.
Why are african elephants and indian elephants different in terms of their ear sizes?
Environmental adaptions.
The genes for their ears are analogous, right?
12>:
I dunno
14I need something at home that's worthy to bench press
/me ponders his TV
Unless of course we're going to trust in the existence of Pangea.
Do you have an answer?
I believe in Pangea!
14or my speakers hmm
But it's far from proven.
That and the fact that the coasts of the continents continue to deteriorate each year, which would explain how they "broke apart", when in reality the parts that connected them are just submerged now.
Well how do you think england became an 'island'
Both do the same thing.
Benchpress TV? LOL
So...We're sinking?
Yes dari, head for higher ground
Mexico City is sinking 6 inches every year.
14yeh? why not lol
When we start to sink I'll build a raft out of people

The heat, however, might kill us. :P
That's why we'll live in fridges
I'm done.
Ha.
Once or twice
Then the other planets would start hitting on it, thinking it's not married.
lol good one
But anyway, there was one where the whole episode is about Earth having narrowed in its orbit around the Sun, and everyone is dying of thirst.
Earth and saturn could get together and make little baby planets

My favorite Twilight inconsistancy: If Edward is deprived of all blood when he hasn't eaten in a while, how does he get a hard-on?

The most ridiculous part of Twilight is Bella's heart actually stopping when Edward kisses her.

No, I dont like religion lol
I don't like religion because it's forced on you at school.
Yeah
Even though I got an A8

And they do that for the exact opposite reasons.
Dari: In all schools, or yours?
Majority of schools
Mine particularly, but in all schools.

America has the only Church devoted to Pastafarians.
2Yay Mukuro is nowhere to be seen

o.o
Secularising public schools is more of a way to 1) prevent the majority religion from being taught, since people don't mind *their* religion being taught in school, but hate other people's religions being taught in schools
I dont think any religions should be taught in schools, anywhere
it's like you don't have to believe it you just have to learn it it's not that hard
Secularizing public schools is not 1) an attempt to rid children of their religion 2) a way to "teach atheism" in schools 3) [insert crazy theory here]
Religion should be disbanded :D
:D
Religion can be taught, but not officially. they'll teac basically anything but Christianity, but call it "culture."
*teach
^_^
Learning religion is the same as learning theories. Neither are proven, but both are accepted by many people, even the majority.
I can imagine the first day of teaching "Atheism" in religious studies at school....
But they should keep it to themselves
Then should you keep viable theories to yourself, as well?
Atheism was fun in my school, the teacher would feel all uncomfortable lol
That way they'll work solely on fact and wouldnt be biased
Atheism isn't fact.
Yeah.
oooooooo, I know how to counter this argument :D
/me raises hand
PIck me pick me :D
Go ahead.
Wait, are we going to go into the kettle thing, too?
You could just tell us instead of pretending
Oh, right xD
Bertrand Russell's kettle. xD
:D
If you have a statement that can't be disproven, but has zero evidence to support it, you can treat it as it was disproven
That and the fulcrum of most religions is faith, the evidence of things not seen.
Right. Utterly and comepletely without universally-recognized proof.
Bowl, you mean?
yes
*archaeological
If they had that sort of proof, they'd be rich by now :P
The fact is, all the evidence is going the wrong way for theism :/
Well, it is always conveniently denied of them. Noah's Ark is evidently nestled up on Mt. Ararat, but the Turkish government won't let them in to get a single picture.
?
/me googles
Hehe, I think the Turkish government should map the place, just to prove Christianity even more wrong :P
I don't think it has been definitively proven wrong.
Although there is a lot of considerable problems with organized religion.
*there are
xD
Make sure you correct it, I meant fallible.
Just me :D
which games?
Oh, righty
never played them
look amusing though
12but the parts you don't do that, it takes a lot of thought to get through
12it has its challenge
12hmm?
"challenge everything"
or their 'old one'
It's not clear, we've just grown used to not killing
12ll
12lol
To not killing? We kill more than ever.
and no school tomorrow
12i really like those games though
12i need to track down the first one
12it's the only one i don't have
how about download from pirates?
/me shots
0.o
Nuke a population, and its far less personal than stabbing each one. That's the difference, psychologically.
*it's
12i can do that
12you support by buying it
How do you all feel about world hunger?
meh I support HOI2 but didnt buy the expansions
12afterall if they lose out on money, it's less money for them to make more games :P
Comets?
But in reality, there is more than enough food to go around in the world, it's just hoarded by those with easy access to it.
It may be cruel but I consider it population-control
I think considering it mainly effects underdeveloped parts of the world, it's not a very efficent form of that.
No, but think how bad the planet would be if everyone was well fed
Make them swap then
Not to say that Africa isn't heavilty populated too, lol.
*havily
*heavily

Wonderful weather today, isn't it?
Juffo-Wup: everybody hates you you little [censored] go away and never come back
That's not very nice to say.
I don't give a [censored]
I must say, that rickroll was interesting.
I do believe I'll run off to the penguins because of this.
There, I shall find spiritual peace.
And all the baby seals I could possibly hope to consume.
Perfection.
Invisible writing?
Like the microwave.
It emits awesome radiation.
I made a song about radiation, once.
juffo wup is the dumbest name i've ever heard
It was a pretty terrible song.
Like the CMA.
It clogs up all the traffic.
Even the airwaves are terrible.
I mean, a little country music is okay...
/me puts juffophuck on ignore
But there's a limit, you know?
But no.
ARGH
I mean, seriously.
I hate smashing turtles on the road.
Smashing armadillos is far superior.
The buzzards don't have as much of a problem.
BUT NO
Darn turtles.
And they have to be endangered, too.
I find this out after my dogs bit one's leg off.
I don't control my dogs.
My dogs don't control my dogs.
The leash does.
Namely, the leg being gnawed off.
And dying.
Just one more...
YES
Screen is filled.
Now I can stop spamming, I have achieved happiness.
.
Yes?
I feel sad today
Why?
[23:05] <Juffo-Wup> Why?
Was it something I typed?
Probably.
I don't doubt it.

Why?
There's no way to tell if you're being /ignore'ed
oh

Or even /silence'ed
just great
Unless they're ignoring everything you say completely
They could be getting the messages and just not responding too
Either way you're being ignored

He overreacted to some joke I made and it now ignoring everything I say

Probably.

oh awesome
i was on here yesterday
I did an acoustic one too though
if I can't figure that out I have a project that I've been working on for over a year I really need to finish

yesterday he tested spyrochat for "spam detection"

he went all across this network asking everybody how to get unbanned
..alright, now I'm scared
I thought he was just an idiot at first
but at one point he signed in as "F4LLENV4MPIRE"
/me goes to remove photos on spyroforum of herself
which seems kinda trollish
Hahaha
don't want any chantards to use them
sorry
they made profiles of all the mods last time
I'll correct myself
and took photos and information and links and [censored] of me they had all my profiles on everything
...
there
yes.
my whole point.
That's just creepy
all my photos and everything
i know
just the mods
have there been any hints at trolls there?
yes
uh oh
You know, I don't even know why I bother with this forum anymore if we're going to keep getting attacked.
yeah, and it really doesn't seem like SR cares about the forum anymore
to be honest...
I never see him post or anything
yeah.
he doesn't give two [censored]s
it's just not worth it.
ugh

I agree
he's way too preachy about it
12hmm i think i might still know how to tip the battle in my favor...
he thinks he can force people to christianity and this bothers me. I wouldn't be bothered if he wanted to share but they way he's a missionary and trying to convert all of the members makes me mad.
12right now i think the battle is like 40/60 in Tomai's favor lol
he tried to convert me in PMs xD
I don't try to force anybody to change their beliefs because I know thjat's impossible
12isn't key an ice user?
XD I can imagine how that went
07water
12ouu
12interesting :3
because SR can read everyone's PMs and he read our convo
12i'm going to enjoy having key by my side
I never realized it until recently, but SR's kinda adamant with his religion too
SR's never forced religion upon me and I've never really witnessed him do it to anyone else but I guess it's possible
well, I can't see him forcing it
which isn't a bad thing if he doesn't force it
yeah
I guess you could say I'm in the middle
I don't have any sort of belief
I think things are certain ways one day and something else the next.
yeah
The cycle goes on.
12i don't know if i can beat Tomai but i know i can really irritate him
12if i only can predict his movements XD
07lol
I try to see it everybody's way
everything from Christians to Muslims to atheists
I try to understand all of their beleifs
yup
it's like
.____.

CLIFFHANGER.
have you ever been talking to someone and forgot you were talking to them and closed the tab?
A BAD ONE.
yes I've done that XD
I felt awful when I remembered I was talking to him
2QAQ
2QAQ NOOOOOOOOOOO
2'kay
there's this annoying amv maker kid that takes like 20 minutes to reply to me on things
:P
jk
I did that on purpose
XD
it's like DUDE IT'S BEEN A FEW HOURS, I DON'T CARE, JUST LEAVE :P
Hahaha
"Forgot you even existed, no need to say bye"
exaaaactly
he'll always be like "hi :)" and I'll say "hi what's up" and he'll say nothing for about 20 minutes then he'll say "nothing really how about you? :) :)"
XD
and he always seems to think that I'm depressed or something just because I don't use smileys in every single message I write
exactly he has the [censored]ing laughing or smiling face in every [censored]ing message he sends XD
it's gotta be annoying when there's more than one smiley per sentence too
XD
would you like to see his fail?
:D
Yes!
ok
http://youtube.com/user/sorarikukiari94
don't watch the collab one though that one's ok because there's another editor in it
click the one below called "mep part"
does he always use all these rainbow colors?
yes.
and his clip choice just NEVER MAKES SENSE
whoa
haven't left
XD
too many inverted rainbow colors turns me into a [censored]
I can't even read anything there without getting a headache
lol
Waay too many colors
yup
2XD
/me [censored]in rocks at colors though :D
colors are my favorite thing to mess around with :D
yours is cool too because there's always a theme to the colors and they don't kill the eyes
yup
I only do colorful [censored] if it's like a pop song lol
like lady googoo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHh-iAQNCkA
omg I know right ahahah
I don't like playing around with effects too much
makes it look like I'm an amateur trying to look skilled
me either but people can't seem to grasp the fact that I can't do rainbow effects lol
lol
I've actually never even tried rainbow effects
but that's the only time I ever bothered going out of the way with effects
I have tons of my own premades
colors I mess with
yeah
it's totally different with cartoons XD
Haha yeah
mhmm
I don't like always using actual footage because there aren't exactly a lot of actors here
if you ever ended up using some kind of cartoon I'd def collab with you haaha
/and/ I'm not charismatic (or rich) enough to work with any of them
Haha, we should do that sometimes
*sometime
I'll get some practice with that sort of editing first
because I'm sure it's different
I always get the little kid that wants the subscribers but I'm too nice to tell them no
Haha
subscribers mean nothing to me
me either
I only have two
XD
but then again
we do it weird
or "BRIANOBSESSED WANTS TO BE IN MY MEP"
it's like O__o yeah I do...?
and then there's my channel
I don't understand how people get the subscribers-arrogance
which has nothing because I haven't done anything individual that I'm proud enough to upload
lol
well in the amv community I guess
I remember when I was a n00b
not even
because most of it's on DVDs
and we wanted to sell them
lol
haha
well actually
with the school's iMovie software
you can?
yeah
as long as you don't use any music that isn't yours
Bye SleepingAristeo
or any footage like videogames that isn't yours
see there's the problem
if you do the videogame thing though you'd have to keep it in seperate channels
I always use music that isn't mine
XD
music?
yeah
heya Proto
you can't really sell it then without some sort of legal deal coming up
omg
04Eon
even on DVDs
07o3o
someone's talking
you'd need to buy permission to sell it
2hi
we only sold it to friends anyway
which is a [censored]load of money
sold like 5 copies
lol
lol
is that a rarity ?
For some reason
lol
Tonight's been rather quiet
brb
our first DVD (which was all a joke anyway) had all the songs in the credits with a disclaimer saying "We're not allowed to use this song" for all of them
2o3o
good haha
yea my channel has been the same way
well kinda
earlier was busy
I just had a [censored]load of pointless clips from my friend

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZx99CpbXE
k
yup :P
that's where I got my spyro clips when I edited with TLoS
ahhh
Haha
:D
It's the song that got me into A&A
cool
that one's alright
they have never played A&A at the stations out here
out here A&A isn't well known at all
I never listened to pop radio stations before let alone local I always listened to sirius satellite
I don't have Sirius
I used to have it but I don't anymore
it'd play [censored] months before it got in regular local radio
it was awesome
Haha, yeah
yeah, I bet that's how you heard of a lot of the less well known bands you like
XD
most of it is auto-tuned rap and [censored]
and I don't really like that kind of music
sorry was getting a soda back again
lol, okay
I like some rap
in fact
last night
like a song here and there
but very little of it
Haha, wow
coincidence
hahahah
I like a few pop artists here and there too
same here
or rather, pop songs
eh, I don't like him much
:P
everything's magic just came on on my iTunes lol
coincidence again
Hmm, doesn't sound familiar actually
REALLY???
yep
he has that song her diamonds and someday
and he's the singer of matchbox 20
Oh okay
I like Matchbox 20
cool
I never really like solo artists unless I know them from some other band
idk why, but every band that someone reccommends to me never really grows into me as much as something I find myself.
there's probably a few exceptions but mostly
yeah, same here
actually no\
literally all of my favorite bands I heard through my friend that I make videos with
lol
you'd probably like talking to him about music
he's really into punk and indie bands
cool
but he listens to pretty much anything
Completely overrated
hahaha
:P
I never get bothered whenever someone tells me they don't like my music, she always does and I think she does it to try to make me mad but I never get mad lol
omg I know right
did you feel mad?
Hahahaa
but yeah it's like "gee sorry i'm not an emo kid like you"
I used to be like the emoest kid ever 3 years ago
I was a bit angsty about 4-5 years ago
never really emo, because I kept all my depressing thoughts to myself
lol
but a couple years later I got over the [censored] that was bothering me and now I try to be a positive person
though most my music is still angsty lol
Haha, really?
yeah a lot of music has totally changed me as a person
XD
I think I've heard it
it's one I think about most when I'm sad
lol, maybe not
Yeah, A&A is pretty much that band for me
cool
:P
lol
srsly his album hate culture really is a hate culture it's the meanest album i've ever heard
Haha wow
I don't really have any hateful music persay
a few songs, yeah
but not entire albums
yeah same I have a few angsty hate things here and there
I have at least 5 songs for every emotion I'd say
XD
lol
usually I just listen to full albums
I try to listen to all my songs on shuffle
but there usually is a specific song or band I'm waiting for the whole time
some albums I can't listen to without hearing it all in order though
haahahah I do that sometimes when I shuffle my actual ipod while I'm playing a videogame or something and I'm too lazy to go and select it
yeah same
like the type of album where they blend the songs into each other
I dunno why
it's a proven fact.
:D
lol
omg me too
circa survive did the song blending on their last album
I always listen to it all the way through like that ugggh <3
was it the entire album too?
alesana did that too but idk if you'd be that into them
yeah the entire album
I only have one CD that does it all the way through
I have a fw
*few
a few others do it for a few of the songs, but not all
yeah
there's a ton of others but I can't think of them right now
ugh, don't ever buy a mutemath album
alesana's newest does it all the way through
it even has speaking pieces in between them
I thought they'd be good but it's just boring
maybe it's just the CD I bought
I have armistice bu not any others
...that's the one I have
XD
that happens for me with songs too
that may be it
I'll totally hate something at first then I'll end up loving it the more I hear it
I haven't listened to the album much
I get that a lot too
I think you'd like the band Mansions
hmm
ummm hmm
lol, that's okay
it kinda has that echoey garage on a rainy day feel
:D
idk if you get that
but
yeah
it's great
I'd show you my favorite song but it's not on youtuuuube :( I can send it through sendspace though if you like
helps me to picture it because it's raining really hard here
XD
lol
what's sendspace?
oh filehosting
okay
do I need a membership?
it'll take a few seconds to upload though one second :P
okay
http://www.sendspace.com/file/qcy52f
XD estimated download time is 15 minutes
XD
oh, 10 minutes now
lol
it likes me :P
lolno
just yell at it, it likes discipline
haha, my connection is usually okay, until you try downloading something
*asleep
lmfao
6 minutes...
grr, speed up
I like being home alone a lot
but my family doesn't like to leave very much
:P
lame lol
hence the reason I spent all of last weekend at a friend's house XD
yeah
:P
hahaha
he always got up at like 2 pm lol i don't think that'd ever happen
Well, not doing enough "with the family"
Haha
that's good
1 minute left
lol
Hahaha
10 seconds left!
Done
you should still seriously consider making one that site the greatest thing since the first website ever
:P
this does sound like music I like
thanks
yup :D
I bet I now have a song that my friend hasn't heard
finally, /I/ can recommend a song to /him/
:P
XD
XD
lol
:D
Hahaha, nice
oh you know a really good music movie is nick and norah's infinite playlist
one of my favs
cool
oh yeah, you've told me about that one
I wanna get it though
yeah, I looked at the soundtrack online and it looks like a good one
I still have to see that movie
funniest movie I've seen in a long time
it was really ogod
*good
that's good, because I haven't seen a good comedy in a while
I really wanna see this karate kid remake this weekend
except Zombieland
that was good
Yeah, that does look good
lol
whenever I see him I think of Rush Hour
and I thought both of the Rush Hour movies were stupid
Oh yeah hahaha
I completely forgot about that
over the top haha
04hey Arti
07ohaiburd
hi Arti
haha
not a stern war hero
12Ra!
yes
exactly
:P
/me dances
the friar was still whymsical and cool
but all the other characters they got all wrong
lol
12Bake off is today!!
12Can't wait to see all the other entries LOL
12and eat them!Q
it could've made a good middle ages war movie
mhm
Zombieland and Inglorious Basterds were both like that
Hahaha, yeah
I don't get how anybody could get upset about that one
yup
they star in ridiculous comedies
mhmm
Ugh, yeah I hate that too
like the Monty Python movies
XD
they were all banned for a while
g'night
because people were offended by their jokes
hahaha
XD
it's like get over it kid it's a joke
Haha, I saw that happen in person once
do tell :D
XD
it's like when you mention a race, even if it's about like a type of food, people throw a tantrum and scream "RACIST!!!!!!!"
"mexican food "RACIST!!!!!!!!111111!!!!!11111!!1!!"
Haha, wow
"They're called 'Hispanic'!!!!!1!11one"
because some drugs can actually help people if they use them the proper way
and kids don't realize this
yeah
I can see legalizing drugs for medical purposes
but at the same time I can see some people taking advantage of that
and a ton of her friends "liked" the post
Haha
yeah
I think that's sensible
like with cigarettes and alcohol
but I also think that if it's legalized it should only be for medical reasons
but out of them all cigarettes are probably the thing that's least likely to kill someone
yup
and then they become either stupid or dangerous
yup
that's just sad
mhmm
yeah
too bad it's a lifestyle that harms others as well >.>
I always think that if someone can't see their problems themselves then they're never going to get out of it no matter how hard others try to stop them
I think it's possible for them to get a wake up call through someone else
but it has to be something huge
because habits are not easy to get rid of
yep.
especially if you don't even know you have one
yes but there's also the people that go "fffff I can stop any time I want"
and never do
they don't realize that it's taken hold and they can't stop, no matter how mucht they think they can
they just use it as an excuse I think
Hahaha
:P
me either
yeah I could never sit there and listen to people whine and [censored] all day
I like to think of myself as being good at that
but then there are the times I try helping people and it only makes it worse
he was a huuuuuuge druggie
yeah me too
:(
makes me sad all the time
gotta cope with it though, can't dwell on [censored] you can't change
yeah
that's how I see it
that's how I try to see it
actually that inspiring song I told you about earlier
here are the lyrics of it that I always think of:
12Hai ^^'
14Mornin
07o3o
07BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!
4BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that's a good quote to have
grief I couldn't get over
12BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
04INTERRUPTING BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!
14lol
and I blamed myself for an awful thing I did
instead of trying to get over it
and learn from it
yeah, I kind of try to live by that quote
it's hard to sometimes though
No, I can understand completely how hard that would be
can't think of anything bigger right now
but yeah I was really unhappy with my self for the longest time
I regret doing it now
12LOLZ
12^v^
I should've always been me
oh?
that sucks
I mean how I dealt with it
07no.
I didn't pretend to be a girl
/me runs
:P
yeah I figured
I basically treated one of my friends like [censored] when others were around
D;
he had muscular dystrophy
12XD
12FINE THEN
at first I was just miserable
07XD
:(
:D
but I still hate thinking of how I used to be
me too
12http://h.imagehost.org/0831/cupcakes.jpg
12They are cinnamon flavoured ^v^
07I said NO D:
12Too bad XD
12http://j.imagehost.org/0287/cupcakes2.jpg
07stooooooooooooooooop D:
thanks for hearing me out
There are things about myself I wish I could change too
I don't see why he would be mad about that to be honest
mhmm
maybe he was hoping I wouldn't turn out the way I did, even though he doesn't really know quite yet
yeah I agree
bakinigurl48375
haha
That's the way it should be
yup
glad I have at least 1 parent supporting me
04lol
07no, I just felt like trying to stop you from posting them XD
04lol
04hey Arti
04is it odd to be obsessed with a Role PLay?
yeah, I guess it would
he doesn't really know about everythiung but he respects me I guess
12No, I know odder things that people are obsessed with
12Like feet :/
04ah
04ok the-
04...
04WAT
12LOL
04I just wanted to know because I am obsessed with the DSRP
04._.
04DRP*
lol
Oh, lol
I can only imagine how it'd taste
/me dies of thought
does that count?
XD sure
but still tasty
I hate people that are all over-diety and fitnessy, they make me feel guilty for eating at mcdonald's like a normal american lol
that must suck ahah
XDD
really though people go way overboard,YOU NEED CALORIES TO LIVE
It's like, how do you ever feel full after a meal like this?
exactly
but I still hate their food
it's too healthy and not filling at all
XD
I couldn't stop laughing because some freak is not going to "change the lives" of elementary school children. calories are GOOD for children they need the energy
I thrive off of burgers pizza fish and snack foods nothing else
my high school had to do this "Wellness Policy" that required them to serve certain foods
haha, that used to be me
minus the fish
same here
I'm actually really thin even
haha
even though I've only ever eaten junk food until recently
I feel like if I ate like my sister I would shatter all my bones
LOL
there'd be no muscle whatsoever to support myself
hahahahah
yeah I hate vegetarians too, like not because they're veggies just the ones that preach about it
yeah
cows are meant to be eaten kids get over it
and the fish throwing at pike place market in seattle rarely happens any more because peta got all mad about them throwing the fish around
even though it's an attraction
I couldn't live without meat
See, I don't hunt, but it isn't because I think it's wrong
I'm soooo glad I wasn't born into a vegetarian family
same
one of my other uncles is a hunting fanatic he has like 3 deer heads on his wall
and a hollowed out skull with the antlers
but I don't like it when people hunt and they /don't/ eat the meat
even a fish
yeah
12I need to go get ready for work now
that's just watse
12Seeya later
*waste
hmm
I agree wholeheartedly with that
me too
it isn't worth killing the animal if you aren't going to do something useful with it
like eat it
i think people should only eat meat and hunt if they realize the value and are thankful for it, thankful that something died to keep them alive
exactly!
not kill an animal for sport alone
that's when it becomes wrong
yup
other than that I'm fine with it all
basically I'm fine with it if there's a point to it all
other than just a [censored] trophy
XD
I'm hungry now
hahahahah
nighttime lunch?
3:00
Eh, I'll be up 4 hours later than this once I start working
Haha, wow
hmm
I'll go once I finish this album...>D I hate listening to an album and then having to leave with it incomplete XD it's a weird habit
Haha, yeah when I'm listening to an entire album I like to finish
yepppp
XD
yes
especially when it's an awesome song
they wouldn't understand :(
XD
dogs are stupid
lol
cats are cooler
he'll come over and lay by me for five minutes, [censored], then leave
I has two kitties :D
Wow
I'd hate that
lol
he lives in the house but the cat lives in the garage and outside
he whines when she traps him in the hall
Hahaha
one of my cats is mainly an outdoor cat too
his names thunder :D
Oh, cool name
we think that thunder is my first cat reincarnated
because he's JUST LIKE HIM even similar fur patterns and behaviors
we didn't find him he found us he sat outside our doorstep and meowed as loud as he could no lie
Haha, wow
lmfao
we've had a few cats but they've all had completely different personalities
the one we have now is the best
the old ones all hated me
aww that sucks haha
they always attacked me :(
haha, that's awesome
he's /your/ cat
I've gotten all my pets for free
and our horses
but all our other pets have always been from shelters and adoption
cool
kitty [censored]
XD
they were really mean to all their cats though, once they were old enough to go outside they just shoved them out there and never let them in again
all her brothers and sisters probably died
we saved her though ;D
we got my first cat, jesse, for free outside a walmart
How did you do that?
and asked our neighbor to go to iran with her
and she'd always ride the bus all over the place
they were giving him away lol
then when we were leaving another woman was looking at the last cat contemplating
mhmm
>>
<<
/me turns on an EP
Ha
:P
that's when shuffle's nice, it never ends
just starts repeating eventually
but then I'd never get off
*gigabites
O.O
Wow
1.72 GB
XD
not near as much as one of my friends she has 90 gigs
LOL
how pitiful
:P
16.6 hours
not evne a day!
hahahahhha
Hahaha
:P
lol
I haven't listened to music for this long for a while
lol
Oh, by the way
and see how often we actually listen to some artists XD
I used to have way more music on my 360
hahaha
lol
that sucks
...the reason I deleted it all is kind of pitiful too
lol why'd you delete it?
and my music took up like half my memory
oh jeez...:P
I still have it all on CDs somewhere
I'd just have to find them all
lol
I have cds all over the place
200+
yeah it was stupid too
I have about 10 piles in this room
two or three shelves in my room along with about 3 other piles
Haha
I have maybe 10 actual albums
....
FAIL.
XD
then a whole bunch of burned CDs I put all my digitally downloaded music on
omg

I wish I could get into commissions D:
I needz the money for Uni
But I have no idea how to ._.
lol
06I just opened online commissions, seeing as I got some of my commissions done for people around home and such
Do you get much income for it?
02GIMP
06Paint Sai
06GIMP is pure failure lol
06and Photoshop, don't even go there
Never heard of that one o.0
i still need to get Sai just out of curiosity
06as it's free
06...
and a program isn't automatically bad, if you spend time with it you can do amazingly well with it :P
Omg the time..
06because I am cool like that, I have preferences :)
lol paying for pro- i mean hi
I have to go peoples D;
but i'm going to ask anyway
06bye
bye
that is if you don't mind
Bye bye~
Photoshop I need to learn to use x.x
..uhmm.. ok?
And get
XD
4I like to use MS Paint and PSE ;3;
PSE?
I perfer Artrage
oh
that's all I use but I need to learnt to edit images quickly with photoshop
4I've used Artrage, it just never really worked for me :/
I perfer how it's more like using traditional media

Thanks xD
I still need to find a character I'm actually good with..
i kind of like Cho'Gath as well
http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cho%27Gath_The_Terror_of_the_Void
I should probably get going
Bye guys D:
02bye Bluey
4:3
:3
i was going to start reading guides XD
oh
i really am thankful you want to play with me though Quilava
that i don't like playing games with people if i can't play them with at least one person i actually know
02Were you planning on it earlier Pokestar?
but meh
CR plays too
06I forgot lol
i haven't seen CR talk in a long time
i don't even think he likes me lol
he's usually either on furnet or in PM or something.. or gaming
4Later on, I was going to start sketching out overdue requests
i see
14raaaa
i guess the idea of playing with friends and people i know is sort of a... fear though
It's just their nature -- their goal is to make as much money as possible and spend as little as possible
eh?
i don't want to be griefed by random strangers for being a bad player
12Raa :D
but a friend is less likely to do that
02You said that either some people were doing something at the time you were broadcasting or people were still in school, and then in a semi-whisper you said those schools were lame
02Kk Pokestar XD
14:>
I get that a lot anyway
06lmao yeah
meow
That's why you have ethics laws :P
you have to ask yoursel
f
06well, I'm still savig the guideline tutorial for when you're available
why do you even care if they think you are a bad player
Nuh uh
/me hugs back :3
It's hilarious
but the fact that it simply was put out is enough to irritate me
because they're annoying.
kinda loud though
Link!
one sec
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM&feature=player_embedded
02Ah, well
the one time i played top base
14:3
i wanted to kill myself XD
06oh
06lol
4Yesterday was my last day of school lol
02(which was completely uneeded too, we sat around in our desks and just looked around wanting something to do)
top base?
oh
you know there is 2 bases you play on
06well I'd do the guideline tutorial now then, but you're streaming already
playing as purple
i can't remember the colors
yeah that's a little crazy the first time
02Yes XD
06I'll have to find a day, but it'll probably be either tomorrow....or most likely in a couple weeks
i don't think i even got used to it through that entire battle
06because tomorrow is kinda my birthday lol
i didn't leave it either
/me has to draw you a picture then .-.
12C:

ahhhh
14^^
yeah
considering how many practice games i played
well i wanted to practice match with every character i could
you know?
yeah.
i was told not to do that
because computers are stupid but still
you are going to get a feel for the champion either way
yeah.
I still suck against bots <.<
12:U

03o.o
/me shot

I hardly use TS
02Yes I did
12and you can talk by text as well if you want
12brb
02I even commented D:

i've had this bookmarked for a long time XD
12Mmmm?
neoooon
HURRRRRR
06it wont upload any of my files
12Whats it saying now..? >v<
06wait
/me does the math
10o-o
4lol
06unless this image doesn't work, then it's a problem
06oh yeh...it was size
06nevermind then
/me hides.
well you got "HURRRRRRRRR" from me I assume
and skype is multichat also P:
12You have to invite people in..
13That !Floof script should work on me too LOL
/me flooooooooofs all over PokemonStar "Bow down to my floofiness!"
Nonsense. It was entirely my idea.
still multichat.
ok
/me can't use TeamSpeak :<
You stole it from me, in fact.
is that such a massive inconvenience?
12Airwolve, have you ever actually used Skype?
and how are you supposed to connect without the server IP?
Yes, I've been in multiple skype partays now.
14I've used it before, but the sound card on this doesn't support micropohones :\
ok
12Ok, Airwolve.. using Skype over TS compares to using MSN over IRC
10it is programmed to work for anyone
12TS is simple
02I'm crap now?
/me is shot
12LOL!
ok
10not just for the Espeon :P
/me flooooooooofs all over PokemonStar "Bow down to my floofiness!"
lol
12<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> I've used it before, but the sound card on this doesn't support micropohones :\ <---- D:
lol
10hm?
13Nvm, forget
14Yeh :<
13it, My brain is wacked
sigh Quilava
i haven't fully understood runes
12Not forgetting one very important feature of TS
13Yes lol
12You don't have to broadcast 100% of the time like a phone!
14It's awesome end of!
12o.o
12You can just press a button when you want to speak
she wants to be able to respond to !floof just like Sky
/me flooooooooofs all over Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"
you can also just press mute on skype.
and she should get to do just that
>:3
10nu D:
10no stealz
12Yes but you'd have to keep going to the mute button wouldn't you?
skype doesn't use bandwidth while muted or not talking.
06well I'll get teamspeak too I guess
/me steals it
12If you use TS, you don't have to be focused on the window to talk or not talk or whatever
13!Espeon
/me now belongs to PokemonStar for 3 minutes
12Like I set my "talk" button the the middle mouse button and whether I'm browsing or gaming, I just hold that down if I want to say something
12You just said you have to hit mute to not broadcast..
12So that means you have to switch to the window every time you want to say something, otehrwise you broadcast 100% of the time!
to not broadcast when there's something to broadcast
Skype only broadcasts when there's an input
12Yes but are you really going to hit mute on Skype every time you want to talk and then stop talking? every single time??
>.>
you only need to hit mute if you want to mutter to yourself or speak to someone not on skype
12Umm
12Nothing
12o.o
No you're not.
12Why not?
12x3
Unless older versions of skype are majorly flawed
12oh
12that
03!steal
12you mean
12So .. when you're connected to someone on Skype..
12derp
12XD
03!steal
03!steal
because Skype is more sensible than that and only broadcasts if there's an input above a certain level
Lol
12Isn't it like a phone?
03wtf
/me failed
06arrrrrrrtiiiiiiiiiii
12:U
12You mean a certain level of volume?
/me forgot how to do that
13!Espeon
/me now belongs to PokemonStar for 15 minutes
A certain level of microphone input/volume, yes.
!steal
to eliminate buzz
12o.o

No, its gone west
Wow, I still can't believe you worry about trolls at all.

That's basically letting them win.

/me puts Mamepato in a cage

/me lights butt
It's one of the reasons Rurik hates Ayumi
07-g :^

Exactly
inb4 EW BLOCKBUSTER
12did you ever say he removed the shield? XD
07decision problems?
And you never see him complain about it
I respect him a lot for that
you wouldn't even know
06hey
12in the post
07it was kinda assumed since it was a duplicate that made the shield
Lol dari
12sleep well Shiny!~
12i don't make assumption
12s
02And I traded both away
06looooool
12because they can be wrong
06yeah I flap it back and forth and I feel/hear it pop
mhm
12night Shiny~ ^w^
12that's like using a paper airplane to kill somebody XD then burning the paper airplane to ashes to revive them
/me squeaks
12how you kill someone with a paper airplane, don't ask
07by that logic that would mean that since dragorie killed the duplicate, no one's hurt anymore
07o3o
:3
07:^
Rurik is awesome
yup
He is
12o.o
12i can continue this
12even though all that post pretty much might change now
07o3o
12i did that move
:3
12if the shield is gone i have no reason to do any of that
:D
Haha.
/me slowly walks back into the room
12i got to think it out
/me yawns
/me slaps Cerberus with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout

07:^
I wanna see some heads explode
07''>
07hm
12can't i just say i did that action before dragorie killed the duplicate?
lol
Don't want to take any unnecessary risks
07nah :^
Looooooool
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI19H0nVDT4&feature=related and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH7yoLMExNw&feature=related

12after tomai expands the barrier
12but before dragorie kills the duplicate
ow
lol
delayed reaction
12haiii Chime~
Some of them look really weird
Apparently they're mainly crap.
12why does deku palace sound familiar
12Zelda Majora's Mask
I don't like the starters or the legendaries
Or Zorua/Zoroark
But some of the others they've just released seem OK
12oh
12the idea is that with more light in the area
04back
12-w
12wb Lyon~
04back
12wb
07o3o
12i don't want you to say r
07I was thinking he was trying to do that ant-laser magnifying thing that kids do XD
12"it's going to work" or "it's not going to work"
12because it's just a theory
07I don't assume~
12right now i need to think to myself "what do i want to get attacked with, light or dark?"
/me RUNS
12i think this is how i can irritate Tomai though XD
OWWWWL
sorry, I was eating
THE OWLS
?
Hoothoot :O
THE ANGELS.
/me shot
07also
XD
12Mamepato can you just listen to me once?
12i said not to say that
12now my mood is ruined and i don't even want to RP anymore XD
07:^
12i wanted to figure out for myself in RP not out of it
12the thought has came to my mind
12which was why i was irritated with those two showing up
12XD
12i had this idea thought up before that post
Hey Jinx
07teamwork! :D
12there is no "team" in "glacymr"
12aha
12but from hearing the word instead of reading it
12it can easily be mis-spelled with an i
12:P
12Glacimr
07glacy*coughteamcough*mr
/me flees
blahblahblah
12i was wrong
I DIDNT DISCONNECT
04uh helo
04hello*
04lol
12it absolutely irritates me when people say "Glacy" instead of "Glaci"
04Glacyme does order people around though
04like Key
04Glacymr*
/me hides
12glacyme
12XD
hm?
12the situation hasn't gotten important enough yet
04lol
07:^
12glacy wouldn't see it as such though
12he'd see as it taking advantage of a situation, not really teaming up with someone
07same difference
12well
12there is bad teamwork, and fantastic teamwork
12the two differ a lot
07well a good fighter has to be capable of fantastic teamwork in situations that call for it
07especially if it means the difference between winning and losing
04even if that fighter dislikes those he is working with
04yes
12somewhere along the line there has to be a weakness, weather it is in their powers or... their mental abilities
04Glacymr's weaknesses are mostly mental and emotional, right?
12there is some weakness in his powers, mainly elemental weaknesses
curse you dixie land!
/me is offended
/me shot
12right now in DRP
12glacymr is already being OOC because originally he would of never even get involved in the fight
12heck he would of saw the fight and fly away thinking everyone else can handle them
04well
...
04hey
12hi
Hi
12recently i've been finding it REALLY hard

What's going on here?
04ah

12i really don't like acting selfless and outgoing
04sure I normally have a character with a set mindset
04but I still try and bring variety
12having a character like key
04there is nothing wron with that

12it's extremely irritating
Oh. Every league has someone that does that. My league has this girl that got an enticine and a ursaring prime recently from 2 packs. No steelix, though. XD
12those 2 aren't really good though
12entei raikou legend is REALLY good
I've heard
12the midwest has too many good players
12Pooka lives in wisconsin he's last years US National Champion and won our regionals this season
12Ness lives in Wisconsin, he's won worlds 3 times
Where are you in all of this?
12he placed 4th this year at worlds i believe
12somewhere in the high spot like that
12i live in wisconsin

12ARGH

2no, beautifly was actually a recent idea
:O
chinese food anyone ?
12Unless you can backup the Meowth and Skitty info with proof I won't believe it's anything other than people saying "Lol they look similar"
/me shares some Mexican food
12I still like it, but I like it less :/
2well Arti, they dont look similar, kindof like the relation between Politoad and Poliwrath
02o.o
07put them together and you have
07me!
07:D
/me pokes back

04I just use solid colours.
06ollllllld
2well, if you look closely at Politoad and Poliwag, Poliwrath and Poliwhirl
2Politoad is the only one that looks like it should not be in the picture
07http://www.morenewmath.com/all/
07o3o
06lugianite, why don't you consdier the fact that perhaps the LATER designs were influenced by the EARLIER designs

7ARTI
12Hi
12Lol
7Ah, you've seen?
12I saw and already commented lOL
7Other things, may I PM?
12Yes
/me flooftackles Arti randomly :>
12XD
12Sorry for silence, a bit busy
No probs
I'm feeling kinda k.o.
12k.o? ovO
12Gah I really should go soon..
12Lets see..
12*6pm
12sdfsdthty
four hours is very fine for that
you can hoover whilst the potatoes are boiling and maybe tidy up a bit, then take the potatoes off and let them cool down, finish tidying up and putting the washing away
then cut the potatoes, finish the salad and lean over rest a bit. Pretty easy :)
12The entire house needs a hoover really..
12Usually takes ages
I'll be back later (maybe, depends how long i can steal my mums laptop XD)
you should stick with eating at only one place in the house then Arti :P
12XD
12Yeh sure, just make sure you don't accidentally update the rules page :> I don't have it saved LOL
12I have that rule too but I can't always follow it
12Like right now i don't have a recent enough backup of the database
12It would be nice to have auto backingup every evening -v-
12Would you mind setting one up on my server? :>
I have my computer set to backup automatically
we're talking about the server's database. That's a little bit different
!define bouffant
-!- a woman's hairstyle in which the hair gives a puffy appearance
7o3o
Hmmm.
!define SAN
-!- The San (Ð¡ÑÐ½, Saan) is a river in southeastern Poland and western Ukraine, a tributary of the Vistula River, with a length of 433 km (it is the 6th-longest Polish river) and a basin area of 16,861 km2 (14,390 km2 of it in Poland). ...
Get an external hard drive or something?
...
12eXAKR we're talking about TST not my computer..
I know
12What do I need an external for then/
12lol
You don't have access to the physical server?
12Of course I do
12what are you on about TimeShift?
12To be honest, it's not hard to backup TST to my computer manually but it's a pain
I'd rather it be copied into a hard drive
Just hard drive
Not another computer
nonsense
Or something like that
if the server dies, the harddrive is gone
12We're all getting mixed up here..
...
Zero, admittedly
jk
But, you really want to minimalise worst-case scenarios
Large companies store backups not on servers but on tape drives for a reason
we're not in the 1980s anymore Eon|Zzz
gah
Espeon
12LOL tab fail!
12LOOOOOL
bleh
i know xD
12XD
12Too many E's
12Why am I still here? XD
The more complicated something is, the more likely it is going to fail, TimeShift. Universal law.
12I DO
Yes
<3
most is saved on SAN systems - multiple systems in different locations
For backing up a server
I don't know if that's possible for Arti
12Well
12It is sort of..
simple
12my computer would be the server
12But I have no idea how to set that up
12Never done it
12and eventually get spare hard drives and setup a proper backup system for my system XD
I said I'd build the backup system. That's just a program performing the action. Just a script. It's not important WHERE it's run, but it CAN be run at any place
like on my home server, on another root server, on Arti's computer
Good
try to print music into a book -> same problem
12Er..
12Why can't I setup the server to do that automatically..?
12Or is that something I have to do manually?
12Though during this entire conversation I did backup all of TST's databases
12TimeShift, are you sure?
12What size?
12I think we're at over 50 Megs lol
120MB
12Wow!
12Um
12TimeShift..
well, I'd like not to plan for today, but for tomorrow you know ;)
12I just checked the size of TST's database..
12It says.....
12482.64 MB!!!!
12Ovo
nice
12I could swear it was only 50Megs the last time I looked LOL
12Maybe I'm wrong, not sure..
you should look after if the sql-file you downloaded (the sql data you download is nothing but structurized sql data) is the same size, too
12It should be fine
otherwise you might have the same problem like I had. The dump I had once was cut somewhere in the middle of the data stream
that's why I prefer database-direct-connections
12I have tools to deal with that come to think of it.
12:>
12XD
12I gotta go now for real XD
12^v^
12Seeya soon

Hey
huh
/me sits all over Aero
but i really have to as myself though Quilava
oh
yes.
and experience
i didn't know that
same with turrets.
the same thing diesn't happen with champions though does it?
no
they give more, but just to one person
and are more protected
the camps though
if i used smite i would easily be able to kill him
hmm..
i tested it as well that if i can kill his 2 little friends first i can easily kill him if i take some time to recover after that
Hey!
Yes, my apprentice?
Yeah right...
/me has nothing to say
just 1 on 1 then?
1 on 1 doesn't exist
it's either 3 on 3 or 5 on 5
yes it does
Master? You're not my master!
that's just the maximum, you can start any time
i'm talking outside practice mode
it occurred to me
13gtg
if his first objective is to go for those little camps
you pledged yourself to me over a year ago.
6o.o
Yeah: o.o
1 on 1
You aren't my master you pathetic liar!
kind of does nothing for WarWicks main talent
rm. :/
i know i can pull it off without interferance
but I still suck :(
at least you have a character/strategy
my suggestion is look for a character
you like XD
yeah but
then read a guide for him
I'd need to buy them <.<
and I don't have many points
i could of sworn there is a few characters you can buy for 2000
a few yeah.
I bought one for 450, but I suck with him
Then you truly are misguided. Memory lapses of this calibur are too much of an incovenience to me. Begone.
there is a lot you can buy with 2000
:/
is because well yeah XD
i had like 50 dollars of reward zone certs
/me
wait you actually bought them?
that were about to expire
lol
its a .................. world out there

Not to mention the time it would take to launch 100 spears without me moving.
i wanted to check the most expensive character
IP wise
Fine, defy all reason. You're still my subordinate.
i dunno
yeah

You spelled "grammar" wrong. I think/you/ need some.
4*grammar
i'm using them right now
07!espeon
don't you have to be level 20+ to use tier 3 runes?
b-sydes i cn argu leik dis if i wnt adn stil wiiiin
4*Besides, I can argue like this if I want and still win.
4Go to school, grammar face!

5Hello..?
That was a contradicting insult, young one.
/me poofs ashes all over Roleplay4life
5^___^
4Young one? I'm in 6th grade!
You complimented me by associating me with good grammar, while at the same time telling me to go to school.
/me watches with amusement.
6Lol same here
huh
you might be right though
well
the tier 1 ones anyway
tier 3 don't do that
oh, yeah.
6Haii
Another imaginary killing. Bravo.
that mwould make sense.
you can join if you want
tier 3 are much more expensive than tier 1
6 3OGC
I've only called you two of those things.
okay
yeah you are right
I see this.

6You guys should do this more often.. :P
4Oh, then let me call you this: You are stupid.
brb

4Cynder7: You guys should do this more often.. :P
4If only I was on more...
i don't understand ANYTHING about runes XD
6Same here
the piont of the primary and secondary
the tiers
i'm seeming to understand the different types of runes though
You're getting repetitive.
4I hope you know that I am a Moderator, not here though.
3 is strong, 1 is weak
6XD
That's cute.
primary and secondary?
6I wish I did have popcorn irl.
you mean pages 1 and 2?
6Same here
in the book
the runes are listed as primary and secondary
and no clue
6XD
That's a symptom of schizophrenia.

It'll quit on its own, dude.
6The server
Cool!

Or are you going by a different name?
to this room, yes, but i'm friends with the server owner
6Wtf?
it doesn't?
i dont see a female in there
xD
XD
6XD
If there was a female in there, I'd have already flirted with it.
6o.o
Kidding...
'-'
It doesn't say anything now, thanks to you!
you're welcome :)
Tsk tsk.
6It says you're an it http://wbe01.mibbit.com/smileys/yel06.png
6And why are you fussed about whether it says if you're a he or a she?
12hmm
Because when I first went on here people thought I was a girl.
^ Lol.
6When was first? A year or two ago?
6Lol DB
As soon as I logged on, before I even said my first word on here, someone said, '"Do you think it's a girl?"'
Hey jinx
6Today?
3 years ago.
6Ah.
6>.<
not particularly
lol
Not too similar.
CoD is far more popular.
6What's the difference between them?
6I've noticed :P
I haven't actually heard of SWAT before
6Ah
6Lol
6Woo
brb
Mhm.
6Ok :P
6Lolz
6GTA pwns
Well, not THE Things
As does RDR.
6RDR?
Stitch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me shoots Stitch in a nice way
xD
6Lol
6Never hear of it
I can't believe we let that goal in!
FAIL!
6o.o
6:O
It's possible. Maybe in a flashback.
6I need to continue SWAT.. -.-
Although I loooooove the series I'm glad they're stopping
6Why? o.o
They have twomore sequals planned, right?
/me feeds Kipikipo
*two more
No, Saw 7 is the last.
Hopefully.
Yeah, hopefully.
XP I don't want to do these bounties anymore.
Five was the worst, but still decent. Six was one of the greatest.
http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/06/pokealbum.jpg
i'm actually going to try a real match
you don't really learn much more from practice mode
Wait, how is hoffman cast in VII?
*Hoffman
LOL
Digimon Trainer
07lolpsyduck
someone is using that name
He didn't die in the end of 6, he only had his face partially ripped XDD
Stitch: Where have you been D:
Yeah, the balls don't go in that side
/me points to the other end of the field
Mhm. I have to rewatch them before VII is released, however.
Saw spree!
We should have this match easy, that goal literally slipped in lol
Lol.
Oh, did the goalkeeper back into the net?
Last year I rewatched them all in one day, and enjoyed watching my friend freak out over them.
*watching
I tried watching all 6 of them with a friend one night, we got up to saw 4
No, he stopped the ball...which then proceeded to slip out of his hands and then role into the net
I read that as Spyduck
I fell asleep twice during 4 but then it was about 4am XD
Oh, heh
I've seen that before
:O
/me is covered in ashes!
Oh no...free kick against us
I stayed up all the way, finished 6 and said: Hm, X-Men now? :P
What's really horrible is when a goalkeeper catches the ball, leans back from the momentum, and dips past the line
*crimnges*
cringes*
But yeah, it takes a while.
YES!
We stopped it
=.= I don't want to do bounties anymore...
:D
I'm not looking forward to the Harry Potter recap though

Bribing cops subtracts 400 Honor!?

Brother
Kipikipo:
or how much is immoral the cop?
The first thing
also, I give Karate kid a 5.4
hmm...
10http://i968.photobucket.com/albums/ae162/KasukaHeiwajima/mijumaruatack.gif
but thats a different story
it'd be 'immoral' of the cop to accept a bribe but then thats the police
10also, Espeon, you around?
they get more bribes then the mobs
did you play GTA IV?
RDR
RDR?
OH
Yup, yup

US History consists of a bunch of crazy people
13It was like using markers with a brush

tiebreakers only really have to happen in finals games
02XD
no
06hmm
5England should've slaughtered the U.S., and I live here. xD;; Statistically, they just seemed superior. Besides our team was kinda sloppy that first half...
Because US sucks at soccer
06argh
5Because it's only the biggest soccer/football event EVER?
And we tied England
5@Ragnarok : That too. xD
5We got that goal by a fluke.
wait, where do you live, RP4L?
5Nebraska.
5In the U.S.
in the central time
5Why?
k
5I used to play it as a kid. xD
I don't quite care
5Ahh..k.
I'm just forced to know about it because /b/
and BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
5o-o
Apparently the african teams have fans that have annoyingly loud horns
evening
5Really Ragnarok?
5LOL, yeah.
5America: built on Baseball and American Football.
5And those Founding Father guys.
or not
:(
5**Fathers
06I
06hate
06baseball
And native peoples getting put into opressive reservations.
5ME TOO.
Baseball's okay
5...That too Ragnarok. D:
12Ragnarok is a fun name
/me doooooooooom
5That's the worst stain on US History.. IMO.. next to the whole slavery thing.. >>;;
06ooooook
5Yeah.
no its worst stain is that slave owners say all men are equal
5D:
i mean really
5We scared her off.
nah, its 1 am over there
5;;
she has to go to sleep for some 'reason'
japanese americans being put into concentration-camp-like places solely because they are japanese
Ragnarok: and political repressions
and worker repressions
racial repressions that even go on today
5Brother, I think we all took US History in 9th grade.
and the list goes on
I took it in 8th
i hated it
5(Just saying.)
because it lied like crap
like Texan History
5xD
or how they thanked the teanjos by stripping them of all rights
I loath Texas on all levels
5So I'll spare you. ^__;
12you people post too fast XD
more like you post too slow
:0
just another territory
like the territory of nebraska :p
*got
and we never lived happily ever after :p
The only thing I loathe about today's politics is the cutthroat partisanship
5SUUUUUUUUUH. <3
Texas, all they need is 1 second
5http://cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/a/a/f/b/Big_12_Championship_fc1a.jpg <-- Greatest football picture ever. xD
5@Ragnarok :: Yeah, he came in 4th but for a DT it was pretty impressive.
5He did, however, win a whole bunch of other awards.
arg....Stomach stop being in pain
5Including the Outland. Which I went to go see the ceremony of. And loved. And got Suh's autograph. <3
RP: also did you see how that america thread ened on TST?
5Outland Trophy goes to the best Defensive player.
(ended
/me no forumgoer
5It's not worth digging up again.
Ragnarok: bascially a thread about why 'everyone on tst' hates america
or something like that
wat.
5If you wanna read it, go read it. It's in Debates/Discussions.
then it was closed due to someone showing a shirt of a list of nations bombed by the US
5Personally, I thought it was a very low blow.
thats not a low blow
5There's debating.. and then there's pulling out the claws.
a low blow would be more like...talking about rumors of how 'americans' are stupid
the shirt was like 'the bird'
harsh, yet you can take it
5Like I said, /personally/.
right
5It's just how I felt.
happened a few weeks ago
5On second thought -- I probably don't want to know.
yeah, thats a good thing
/me goes to listen to Ballade of a soldier to translate it
RP: you going to sleep anytime soon? :P
sonce it is 2:38 am
*since
5Yeah, probably.
I only remember one church thing i had, somc meeting where everyone brought their dogs
then that advancement thing
forgot its 'offical' name
its like when you're 12-3 in church
I still have that movie XD
well I'd say you'd have to get all 'nicely dressed up' for it
but then thats every church day
5xD I don't dress up for church unless I'm giving the sermon or something.
12i'm surprised there isn't a sister here
sermon...sermon...
thats like a speech right? XD
5 Yup.
5It's like a lesson in Christianity that usually lasts about fifteen-twenty minutes. Basically.
oh now i remembered why I dont remember them
5x3
..contradictory yes
but yeah I always slept through that
5You probably had a boring pastor.
/me 5runs!
but ironic enough when I was a christain
5Well that's good, at least.
I loathed the christain rules, and all its old practicies
5Why?
they had no point
in my mind back then
It was more like
5Oh. Right. There's absolutely no point in treating other people the way you want to be treated.
5;)
ha, you know thats not really good to say that :P
5'Cause that's honestly all that Christianity boils down to is doing good for other people.
/me Dies
it depends XD
it has unicorns
04lol
ohlook it's working again
or 18 plus 2 side works
hey
lost or misplaced? ;P
/me runs
5But I dunno. I've done /some/ Bible study but not extensively.
02o.o
to me at like...13
5I want to eventually acquaint myself with the Quran (I probably misspelled that).
it was a book that repeated itself
Quran?
5The Islam book of faith?
I thought it was with a K
like Koran
though I suck at arabic
5N-no. xD;
and too lazy to go to wikipedia
5Qur'an.
5That's it.
for literally every relgious person there
tried to get me on their side
5Wow.
:D
the christains
the musliums
there were no jewish though
5(**Muslims?)
I suck at grammar at 2 am
or 3 am really
RP: it'll be at some respects
the teachers dont want talk of religion here
5None?
No
5LOL, we have a bible study club at our school. xD But it's after-school, sooo...
all of them are christain, they dont want any talk of religion for not only does it go with alot of education but then why mess with religion they ask
D:
:(
/me hides behind Curly
lol
I'd definitely be the brawn >_>
and by all I literally mean that
random thing of the night
5Don't they teach some religion aspects in.. like... world history courses?
LOL
this is j3 high
* jr
we dont get that luxary
Lol... "it is my right as an American to eat cattle in a bun."
*lucxary
5Oh, ha ya.
arg..
5I thought you were in high school?
I'm considered in it
but I'm not
I consider this propaganda school but then thats for alot of reasons
:P
5Wow, propaganda school, that's pretty bad.
it wouldnt I bet XD
5Well, maybe a little?
Not in the slightest
I have no problem with some of the teachers
but I dont have trust in the educational system
period
5Well, then, I certainly hope you're going into politics as an adult.
Well, yes but no
I'm into many things
philosophy
world economics
or just economics in generall
*-l
pyshcology
5**?
theres alot
Oh geeze
5Pick one.
hmm...
Harry Haywood
/me runs
thats my favorite
in america at least :p
5Wow. Omaha resident.
5Well, was born here.
Harry Haywood?
5yup.
but he's just...AWSOME
he was the best we got
5My role model would have to be... Well, you'll laugh at the stereotypicality, but...
5Mohandas Gandhi.
LOL oh you wont believe how much I hate him
Ragnarok: african revolutionary
5Seriously. If I could be like anyone, /anyone/, I would want to live by Gandhi's moral code.
he really helped the "black nation" theory
5@Brother :: Why?
why?
heres several reasons
racist
5Yes.
imperialist apologist
how could he take the credit for thousands of strugglign people
and claim it that he did it all
he lead it
5Um, since when?
5It was a national effort.
5He was just an icon.
only for the nationalist congress
but then guess the ICP lost that
when we lost our best man in in the 30s
hanged for treason
put him on trial, he mocked them
Best person I can think of is Nelson Mandela, but that's just off the top of my head
5Mandela is amazing.
I also like...
JVS
5Another Omahan!
and...Beriut
5(Malcom X)
To have someone that's not a political advocate
or whatever term
activist
that's it
3 am, whoo
4 here
5Yup.
but yeah i need to know more about Beriut

oh
04I dreamt my Media teacher was evil.
04Omen? O_O
12Nah just natural worries
04I think I should drop media lessons, I've done badly and I've struggled a lot
04If they'll let me have 2 lessons only.
04I know.
04What was I smoking when I thought media?
04Actually, I think that's Middle 3 if we're talking middle school.
04Anyway, throughout my study leave, I made random videos.
yeah
04And joining Yugioh Tournaments
04I went to one yesterday, made it up to the semis

06...
12Wow
06wtf why?
06a peadge is a peadge
12That really IS thick
06Pidgey is loosely based on a house sparrow
03wtf is a peadge
12FFS DRF

12No
12I don't use DA anymore
06Pidgey was never a PIGEON, it was a house sparrow (loosely) with traits of a Lanner Falcon
12O_o I thought you knew that already
06after it evolved, it became a full Lanner Falcon
7Well, you said you were inactive.

12HAHAH
06o-o
7o_o
03>_>
7Poor drf.
03not intentionally...
12That's just rude
03except that you didn't create Pokémon
12Yeh intentionally ¬¬ some people don't like the Apple comments you make but you do it anyway
03so if you get offended by that, that's not my problem
12it's just rude
06which you didn't make
03yeah, I did
06LMAO
06that's like the best comment there XD
03I thought that was just a clipart
03and if people get offended by me hating APple, then they're just stupid
/me hides
12Well if you get annoyed AT A FACE USED ON IRC YOU'RE JUST STUPID XD
06lol
03but people use it JUST TO ANNOY ME
12No
12That was like, once
03I don't go "EW APPLE" just to annoy people, I do it when someone brings up Apple
03orly?
03Kyu even admitted it last night >_>
06arti, that happens alot actually lol
03people do it just to p¡ss me off
03which I don't get
7If you didn't say you disliked that face, we wouldn't have bothered.
03Quanyails, you use it whether or not I comment >_>
06quan, I've openly admitted I hate things too
06people tend to respect that though
03Zoroark, making fun of products != making fun of people
7Nweh?
12We're not making fun of you personally
12Sheesh
03doing something JUST to annoy me
03is kinda just that
/me apologizes :/
03I wasn't blaming you
06yeah that WAS my fault this time
06well I did do it this time to annoy you
03XD
12Yeh but..
03I just don't agree :P
06I honestly don't know why people get upset about the apple thing
03I don't get *offended*
12You get annoyed when people do it even if they ARENT doing it at you
03I just think it's annoying when people do it 27,000 times a day
03no, see
03it's not that
03if someone just used it once in a while
12Lies
03that's fine
03but people use it like, every likne
06he generally ignores it
03*line
03it's not like I go EW APPLE every two lines I write
03I only do it when someone brings up iPods or something
06!apple
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SCROLL WHEELS
06!apple
03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SAFARI
03and even then I generally leave it to the script
06two lines
03^
03...LOL
06lmao
06anyhoo
03and Arti, WTF? I thought you agreed with me that that face was stupid
03you even set a kill script for it
12It is but it doesn't annoy me XD
12I just think it looks stupid!
03it just annoys me when people do it every 2 lines
03which they do
03like, people stopped saying 'deshou' after a while
12How's that any different from many lines of apple ranting in one go XD
03and I'm sure just because I said that they'll start again just to annoy me >_>
06which I actually thought about...it IS annoying lol
03that, and people shouldn't get offended by me badmouthing products... they didn't make it
12But you get annoyed when people use the face even if it's not to annoy you
06they just use it
03But they DO use it to annoy me
drf: they might be fans of the poor products?
03some of them
06I'm sure some do
12Yes but you still get annoyed even when they don't XD which is stupid
06but others don't even pay attention
12DRF it's the same reason that we spam more when people go STOP IIIITTTTT
03and I never said it was annoying, I just said it's stupid
03XD
03well
12Omg liar
03how about I make a script that adds "EW APPLE" to the end of every line I say
7o3o
03and we'll see how long it takes for people to start whining
12You're always telling people not to use that face because it's annoying
12LOOOOOOOOL
7Like O_o or :P
03first of all, it's not a smiley
03it's not SMILING
12Maybe it is to SOME people
03I've never seen you use O_o
06O_o
12Then again, how is D:< a smiley?! That's not smiling either!
06^literal smiles

*cries*
12Quan that didn't happen to me when I just clicked eXAKR's TV tropes link

03which is exactly why you start clicking everyting
03XD
03*everything
12But.. I'm not interested in clicking them
12They don't interest me in the slightest
arti its sky4eva

7Well, do. :P
03XD
oh...
03I suppose you can't please everybody
7I actually got sucked in from ButThouMust.
03I have no problem with TV Tropes, I just try not to get sucked in
03I mean, I agree with most of the tropes
03I've actually quoted that "Imperial Stormtrooper Accuracy" one several times IRL
03or w/e the name is
7Acadamy.
03your face
7Academy*
03no
03it's the one about how the bad guys can't aim

03hm, yeah, that one

7Because apparently, the mooks all graduated with a degree in gunfiring from there?
03LOL
03degree in gunfiring, wtf
06lol I found a false fact in the tropes
06rock is weak against grass
03hm?
06:P
03that's not false
03they're saying you don't learn actual grass type attacks until a higher level
03now THAT, I can't verify
03but that made sense to me
HAHAHA OH WOW
03XD
03Wikipedia is, though.
/me hides
to a certain degree
on certain things it is
no-ones listening to me
03got the school's IP banned from Wikipedia :D
03Aurora, oh. well it got cut off
i was right
06sorry lmao
drf: orly nao
lol our school got the whole range of ips and such banned from too many sites to remember
03:P
7Where is this info, Rora?
03and they ended up banning the school from editing it
ha XD
03but it was us that got it banned :D
03I don't mean the SITE was banned
03I mean if you go to edit Wikipedia
03it says "Your IP has been banned for constant abuse"
03now I believe it says something like "You cannot edit pages from a public institution due to its tendency to be abused", or some variation of that
7Ah, FakeUltimateMook?
03LOL Espeon
03you can get banned from 4chan?
03That defies all laws of the universe.
03that entire site is devoted to people being retarded trolls

Hello~
I read "Rejoining" as "Reloading" for some reason
YES
ok
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3ymjbFpCf1qzvjn8o1_500.jpg
07because you're still going nuts over the catnip apparently
hi Bloatedfish
hi
03yes, we're all in a chatroom and we hate chatting.
more floofhugs
hey
03<Roara> no /slap and no /kick (why) <-- not sure why SysReset removed slap... LOL, kick... it's under hOp commands
knock it off >_>
03<Roara> this looks all ugly compared to IRC though <-- I prefer that
drf is such a bully :(
03I LIKE that layout
03but if you don't
03Tools - Options :)
03just change it XD
i know
nah I fixed it
03OK
kick is there
but regular IRC had a kick (why)
03yeah, slap is the only one they got rid of
03dunno
03it makes more sense under hOp commands, TBH
OH
The "why) is there still
03yes
erm
I can't kick LOL
03o.o
03who are you trying to kick?
I click kick, and it gives me the popup
Aero

03o.o
the popup goes away
but she's still here

03I usually don't believe in banning
03but when people are morons
03then by all means

Looks like timesplitters to me.
Except Timesplitters was awesome.
this is just boaring.
Yeah.
Project natal interests me, I always lose controllers or run out of battery
we'll see how it is in the demos
I don't 100% see how it's going to work, but I suppose they're still developing/testing it.
I think its going to be an IR flood along with a camera with an ir filter
in order to see depth
4bye
all of these guides give you rune/masteries you should use. neither of which I can really have since I'm low leveled.
then don't use them
the rune/masteries that is
look i read the guides of a few champions
and one thing i learned

13Which season? xD
101st
13Ah
10After the 3rd season, things got bad
oh wow, someone I agree with
/me hides
10I don't think I've ever seen Digimon Frontier (season 4) before, but Data Squad was wtf-ish
10Oh wait, nvm I Google'd it
104th season was just as bad as the 5th
10D:
10That was my favourite
10along with the 1st
10mainly because of Renamon, Terriermon, and Guilmon :3
13I liked the second. The fourth was okay IMO, but it just wasn't digimon... It was out there...
13Renamon is aweaome :U
10Yus
10she is floofy
14Renamon is cute

This is how they expect to compensate? :P
Mmm, Xbox kinnect seemed very accurate and advanced.

LOL
"They know Kirby's got game"

Just ask SR about "Skittles".
I dunno, it was live streamed yesterday.

"Kirby's Epic Yarn"
WTH

Haha, title?
Kong*
Haven't said yet.
I hope it's Epic Donkey Kong.
And right behind them? ;p
Anyway...
its ok if they don't see it happening... look its hard to explain XD
They haven't even mentione the 3DS yet though.
lol, just stupid paranoid English people *hides*
Oooh, what's that.
?
D:
hi!
10So...
Not 100% sure, people keep saying "SHOW 3DS NOW SKIP THIS CRAP"

3ds*
10oh wow, a Goldeneye remake
I still need to make a list of the things I can do for when you are at work Arti ;>
Yeah, Goldeneye remake looked good.
You missed some pretty crap title names though.
like make me lunch
10Kirby on Wii, finally
10I missed the gameplay though
not that I would by a wii, or any console for that matter ^^'
They're doing 3D without 3D glasses.
Somehow.
I'll make you some fish and chips, with vinigar ^v^
....
I hate you
Oh, that's the trend lately. A lot of games are supposed to have that. -shrugs-
How? O_o
now they're talking about the 3DS
Felling is mutual ^v^
*feeling
"Disney Epic Mickey" as well.
You tell me.
how does the 3DS even work
I know if you add dimensions on a screen, it can seem a bit more "poppy".
they say you don't need to use 3d glasses
exactly
7?
Would probably used layered screens
on a sofa
You can slide something on the side to adjust how 3D is it. O_________o
with huge screen
I gtg
I can do the same with my computer ovO
take care!
need to do security checks before I leave at night
bye!
Not yet.
http://www.ustream.tv/e3
If you feel like watching it.
Oh, thanks.
Slide pad?
told ya
Oh well, they still showed a couple DS games.
xD The accent is overwhelming.
Take photos and view them in 3D...
Hmm.
I don't get this.
Me either.
7...
WANNA BRUNTHER!
Looooooooool.
They've pretty much lost my interest.
Oh, another Kid Icarus?
lol pit
Some of these games, like the GoldenEye remake, would be really good if they weren't on wii.
I know! GoldenEye especially.
I just find most games are really awkward to control on wii.
I use the GC controller whenever it's supported.
I don't have any. :/

I'm 15
Ahh
Me too!
And Texas is not bad at all
/me matches two out of three

Correct
I hate where I live
rural cali is terrible
Zen: Soloing isn't too bad -- you see the airport, it's all good
No way to get lost
/me humps random people

Solo cross country, it's soooooooooo easy to get lost
this is cross-country

Are you talking about airplanes?

Hi Curly!
Meeting some family
04I find this unfair

I won't however
/me hugs the rules
lol Sneas XD
:O
mirc is free
the demo is
the payment request is a lie
:3
it's a lie
I had the free trial
it keeps working
oh
lol
xD
After it was over it still worked
ehh, I like XChat anyway
But it reminds you to pay every once in a while
I use Icechat though
and I don't have to relearn it when I reboot
Ello'
Because I felt guilty about not paying for it <.<
xchat is native
I'm here early because of the great things revealed at e3 this year.
If anyone cares, just say something.
it's way more lightweight
is xchat free?
mirc has a huge mem footprint
and yeah
um, kind of
it's GPL
Huh
that's old then,
which you can find by looking up ychat
I dunno,
but if you actually go to the xchat official website it asks for money
i'm running XChat
and it's free
Just being hungry :3
huh
You?
ychat
I just ate lol
/me uses Konversation
http://xchat.org/windows/ says it costs $19.99
www.xchat.org
huh
um, let me find the ychat website
How can you "legally pirate"?
Isn't that kind of an oxymoron?
I run TinyXP and Ubuntu in a dualboot
o.o
http://www.silverex.org/news/
Well, I prefer torrenting legal files
HAI
14Ohai Freyskol
I torrented TinyXP, but that's legal
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XChat#Shareware_controversy
14:3
I want to set up Win7 in a dualboot
/me has XP and 7 is uninstalled
14xD
EEEEWWWWWw
but I'm sure you can imagine how long I stuck with Vista
:D
why do you need XP and 7 at the same time?
:D
:D
:D
XD
You slapped too hard!
what's a *good* free IRC program then
:.:.:.:
I don't wanna mess with XChat if it's all whiny
There we go
Hello!
Zen: KVIrc is a good one if you like features
lol
ychat is basically xchat but free
Lol, i used to use Pidgin's IRC
12xD
/me recovers from the slap
I like icechat
it has a few problems but they're pretty minor
icechat is term though, right?
it's in a terminal window
like, it isn't GUI
telnet \o/
«Zen» Depends
I have used everything
umm
Oh
same thing
No, it's not then
basically
basically
jinx :p
Not terminal
but I don't run FF anymore
irssi is Terminal
Dont need it open
FF had weird closure issues
Not at all
I'm on Opera now
which has it's own IRC thing, but it sucks
brb
I drank coffe
http://www.icechat.net/site/
the old versions might have been
Looks like it from some of the screenshots
14Hm?
«Zen» one of the most AMAZING ones I have ever run is mIRC with a little script
Opera is great
Called Invinceable
it's fast, and it isn't opensource
well
lol
I dislike how it handles things
and also that the tabs just keep cramming themselves in
o.o
without scrolling
It does for me
no it doesn't
not open image in a current tab
I dislike it's process management
/me is making a summer mix playlist to burn on a cd :D
FF
Oh
I like having everything in one process
o.o
FF!!!!!
:D
/me glomps
when you're looking at 20 pictures and you want to see them all independently you'll have to open 20 more tabs >.>
I used to use FF, but I hate it now, too slow.
until it died
oh speaking of which, I got the Warped 2010 cd
only $6!
is it good??
ooh
I'm going out for a bit, brb
KVirc has a winamp plugin
03finally, got some dress shoes that don't HURT
14XD
/me does both though :(
is alesana, emarosa, or I can make a mess like nobody's business on it??
14LOL!
03the salesperson was this somewhat hot girl, right
03and my mom's like
oh really? Aiden is on the back cover
03when she walked into the back room to get the shoes
alesana and emarosa are
03I was like ">_> yeah I guess"
03then as we were walking out
03"You wanna go back in there and ask her out? :P" and I was like "NO"
ffffff<3
03and she's like "Are you finally starting to be interested in girls?" and I was like "I Have been for years... being interested in GIRLS is different than being interested in DATING them"
14XD
I'll brb
And Chrome's CPU usage is ~10-15%.
there we go
oh
seen alesana live 3 times
yeah
03WTF @ the radio
haha, cool
Opera's great
03BROTHER? WTF?
03He turned gay?!
I did download and try Opera, but it just didn't become my regularly used browser for some reason.
but when I closed it,
the process didn't die
14WTF
14Ovo
every time
for me
Yo
It's strange.
do you try manually killing it?
You guys there?
well
someone should make some consolidated program,
and leaves it running in the background
but NOT browsing
I like the beginning of the CD
03bbl goddamnit
I switched to Opera
14o.o k D:
and never looked back
then dropkick murphys
12D: Okay
doesn't Pidgin do that kind of thing? >.>
Yes?
that works out perfectly for you doesn't it haha
What's up?
hahaha yep, like it's made for me
Not much.
I made a huge mistake though
>.>
Cool...

Cerberus, I agree 100%
I like the Wii, but I wish the other two consoles would stay traditional
i'm tempted to keep that skin installed XD
aparantely they have others
It even looks the same
XD
only with that light up ball
which makes it look ridiculous
many others
The 360's answer to the Wii is a camera that allows gaming without a controller
but it looks gi[censored]y to me
[20:46] <+Lambda> but it looks gi[censored]y to me
XD
XD
http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/224
I personally don't care for that, but I know a few people here do
12lolz

5Ditto on Shiny's comment.
7,,,
06knwoing me, I'd try cramming everyhting into those stories
06and how I have my stories plotted out, it would be very difficult to turn into a comic
02You learn and you make :3
5Um... "Show don't tell", like everything? (: It's just the same with comics.
02Fff, my chain's up to 32 now

5That's awesome!
02Just to get the skills to actually draw it .-.

7heh well night
06I prefer regular now tbh
5Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinyyyyyyyyyyy....
5Shiny, not really. xD; It only took me two tries. (My Flaaffy -- now Ampharos -- was beast.)
5I had an Ultra Ball and a lot of luck on my side, LOL.
02Hey y'know
02I went into a cave to find a Lapras I think
5Oh, nice. :D
06looool
02I'm sure there's hundreds of bad fanfics out there
02*coughjustreadmineandyou'dfindoutcough*
/me is shot
02XD
5It was actually quite a thrill to write. :D
5**.
02Reminds me of my first (fail might I add) fanfic
02I won't explain i
02it*
02And my chain broke at 38
02Just like I predicted
06lol
5My first fanfic was an epic fail. D: It has never seen the light of day since. I don't know where it is, haha.
06my first one filed as well
5Here's that fanfic by the way, in case you ever wanna read it: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4234644/1/bSwitched_b_bIdentities_b
06failed
06but the second was finished, I actually like it
06also finished
06I have three finished ones
5I have yet to finish a decent fanfic.
02o3o
02I can't
02read online very well
06"Song of the North Wind", "Darkness in Light", and "Seven Hundred Years"
5Aw meep.
06SHY was a fun one to write
5Print it out? :D
02I could try
/me remebers SHY
5Aaaaahh. How 'bout that. x3
06SHY was a story I did a bit of research for, as I wanted it to be a very believable story of the tale behind the legendary beasts, the two towers of Ecruteak, and the two birds
06and how all that went down
5Awesome. I think I'll definitely check SHY out, and the others.
06here on TST
5Okay. :D
/me really needs to read it too
04NIGHTSHADOW
/me hugs
14Hey there NS ^_^
06lol
02heya Newberrytiger
/me is away: afk
02sorry
04aww cya
02Sometimes it's fun to just read fanfics out of curiosity
5OOC is like "Out of Character". It's when someone takes a character from the series, manga, games, whatever and makes them completely different from how they were intentioned to be. It's like a really bad misinterpretation.
:D
02All right, I think I understand
5Like Satoshi, Kasumi, Takeshi would all be "canon" for PokÃ©mon. ;)
14Sounds great :D
heya
02Oooh all right
5And all the legendaries that have been in movies or the manga have those established, "canon" personalities.
02alright
02I need to afk now
5Especially in the dubs.
14Laters (:
5EW TWILIGHT.
5x3;;
02Exactly!
5Twilight is considered by some people "bad fanfic" for a reason.
5I'm surprised Steph Meyer got the series published at all, but the editor probably knew tweenage girls would go gaga over it...
06ok
06the editor
06needs to burn
02She had an editor?
02replied, Newberrytiger
02bbl now
06you never noticed it lol
:)
5I wasn't paying attention to grammar, etc. xD;
06lol
06now

06gonna stick about 500 plastic forks into my friend's lawn
06why? because I'm simply awesome
any other reason?
06because
06it's her birthday
Some games are released at a cheaper price point
06traditional birthday surprises
Like...
06as much as I want the 3DS
06it'll be UBER expensive
what's-it-called
06and then yeah, the games
06probably 50 bucks each as well
/me falls asleep between Twilight and Proto
/me is going to do work in like an hour :<
06and apparently some companies are going to release movies to for 3DS
wat.
06well yeah DVD
06but if you wanted to see it in 3D again
06kipi
06they do
06they're UBER expensive beasts though
O.o I heard nothing of thatthough
06samsung
06they made one
06http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/tv-video/televisions/led-tv/UN55C7000WFXZA/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail
06now if you have about 3500 to spend, go get it
06....
06for games then?
06you suck at explaining
Maybe you suck at understanding. D:<
^
and I say because they don't make them themselves, they get other companies (like Samsung) to design them
They probably have agreements with companies like that to not go into other businesses
'w'
Hi.

Except the state just had to have their daylight savins
07ah
07nice. is that fun?

No. I'd imagine living out in the country would be more fun
07probably
07lol
That's also part of the reason I don't have a job
07there's a little town barely attached to mine called Lehi, and hardly anyone knows it exists lol

03Because I like to eat toast after breakfast, too XD
7i dont know
07it never made sense to me...
<Ninetailes> and the dads a espeon <--- You said you did confidentiality D:
/me HIDES
07lol
And Espeon looks like a cat just because, that's why
7whats jolteon
7?
7SA
07lol
7heh
14Are there enough spaces to do that? :/
7yep
07indeed
14Pokemon doesn't have to make sense because it's too epic.
7whats jolteon serisly
07an alien fox
07...?
7a pine apple?
07brb
14I'm guessing Jolteon is an electrified canine with fur problems. XD
7o.0
14static fur
7and no tail but some how uses irn tail
7*iorn
14Jolteon has a tail. It's just lost in all the spiky spikes.
7?
14a radiated fox
and is win
14due to radiation
Most of them are probably vulpine/canine except Espeon.
7vaporeon is a mermaid fox thingy
14I don't think Vaporeon looks anything like a fox.
7heh

But heck, I'll be in one of his videos for the kind of money he can give out
7k
12XD

Of course. Ive got nothing against his money.
7where is it
I just dont like his music.
7your profile?

7where is it
yeah haha

I feel proud to say I don't know his lyrics

03*tedious
03but at least I can use IRC, XD
14That's work all over
03I mean, I never asked
14Boring and tedious

6calm down
7ok
His lyrics usually dont make sense
7ok
Ohshi-
6oh that's beyond me
But he says it in a way that 13 year old girls add meaning to them.
6that'll be tomorrow then
03GOOD FOR YOU

Just haters.
/me floofs the Lord of the Seas
14^^
oh wow
/me floofs
But I have a 13 year old sister.
chomp.
lol
5Like.. SAI is really nice but it turns out PSE7 doesn't want me to use Pen Pressure either. I think it has something to do with the fact that this is Window 7 and my tablet is oooooold.
which tablet is it?
5So I'm using SAI. And I like the rotate button. xD It's very nice.
cool
Is she into him?
6if you really want a tablet, invest in a bamboofun
That's good
Shes homeschooled
she isnt exposed to the fads
6UGH
/me is cute and floofy
lol
Ahh.
/me moves about in Lyalia's belly ovo
she thinks for herself.
6I forgot how long it's been since I've had soda
haha
6that was gross
<D_L_M_B> LOL
<D_L_M_B> Well anyhow, I am VERY impressed with the little thing.
<bobhaha> do you have LPM??
<D_L_M_B> yes
bit hard?
<spyrorocks> Oh wait...
7what
5That I need to invest in a Bamboofun. xD
6Lyalia, diet pepsi
bit more easier please
6yeah
6bamboofun <3
6there's bigger sizes
03at both of those
6....
6>_>
/me is glad he did homeschool
5Yeah for like 200 bucks.
...
were you homeschooled?
6RP, that doesnt sound right
6that's way too expensive
5o-o
Yeah, for high school
5Maybe I'm thinking of a different Wacom..
yeah
I didnt know that.
Ive been homeschooled since grade 9.
or as you say down south
7better?
"9th Grade"
6oh well
6then yeah, 200
6mine was like 100-ish
Same here --
7thanks!
7i just found some thing
I got sick of the 2 hour bus ride.
I got sick of the people
It felt like prison
7hit up arrow key
5Hm. Well...
6oh thanks a lot, teacher, using terms that weren't even in the reading
7on key boad
The people were alright...
5I get claustrophobic. xD;
6wth
But I got sick of being asked if I wanted to fight.
6this is one of those sentences I can't make sense of
7i know right
6I've re-read it about 20 times
That was everyones response to something they didn't agree with
I just know how some of these school shooters get motivated to go over the edge
I would have never shot people.
But I can see how some people don't have the self control and go nuts.
Yeah
I hear college is totally different though.
It is
7...
:>
6Most students don't realize the extent to which their grades are influenced by accidental happenings. <-if anyone can translate this, help me lol
The cool thing is that most of our student government was homeschooled for a while -- my VP was homeschooled since Grade 3
6RP, that's stupidly cheap, but 80-90 isn't uncommon
and I refuse to support their paycheck.
14<:
Thats because we're smarter.
14Quiet channel is quiet D:
Yeah, there's always pervy teachers
'm AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
10:/
It was in the news a few years ago that a teacher married one of his students in high school
14OH Sneas
Isnt that illegal?
/me pokes
or alibama...
5Like an accident can bring you down a lot, maybe. If you make a mistake, even a tiny one.
I mean, 18 or over <.<
In Alabama, it's in the consitution that marriages between kin cannot be made illegal
Or is that just a joke.
6k thanks
I see

Her parents must have had to approve it if she was underaged
6WTF is that supposed to mean
around here you can get married at 17 but you need parental approval.
5xD
7you lose?idk
Unless they changed that in the past 20 years.
7soryy
Yeah thats not really a problem then.
I personally believe that you shouldn't have a intimate relationship in a professional environment like that -- I don't think you can perform professional duties and have an intimate relationship at the same time
/me is still engaged to be married to Curly for Canadian citizenship :3

Hi
although he might notbe able to retire for some time.
6yeah are you him?
I am going to sleep great tonight
it's kind of weird how just a hundred years ago all of the lower mainland was a forest
bbl
going out with Tobi
:O
no
XD
well, maybe slightly more than a hundred years
why
Its pretty cool actually.
most of BC is untouched.
it is :O
it also makes me feel sad
7okay 1 sec ill ask YOU
it must have been beautiful when it wasn't colonized
ok...
I sort of like it, we can drive to the city when we need to and be bushmen when we want.
Curly: But no one would've been able to enjoy it when it wasn't colonized D:
Theres a ton of it though that still is beatiful. we have hardly colonized 0.5% of bc.
yes they would, the natives managed it
Oh
7real queck
LOL
they couldnt talk to people on irc about how awesome it is.
xD
xD
7oh
7ok
yeah...
Oh look
Ryft is here
Hi Ryft
they aren't?
yes he is but he hasn't said a word haha
ryft wake the [censored] up
Hahaha
they haven't been here since the last ice age
7where already buddies
i know
7sweet
lol
i know!
I'm glad it's not too hard to get Canadian citizenship
I'd hate to be a Canadian trying to get US citizenship
yeah haha
we let anyone come on in.
we've been critisized for being too open and not fact checking.
it's hard to get a US citizenship?
Uh...YA
Very hard
I mean for Canadians?
Yeah
Anyone
anyone
I thought Canadians had it easier
weird
Maybe a little
We do racially profile more than we should
we have an easy border crossing at least
it is very hard to get a us citizenshio
unless you marry someone from the usa
7sa?
even then though theres a long waiting period.
My cousin married someone from seattle.
grlgrdlgdgdr there are great downloads today on lfm for me :D
7so hows the growlite coming along?
OMG! even itunes
gaslight anthem
yessss
lol
lol
weird
/me was not aware the US was /that/ paranoid
gaslight anthem for free lifes good
how often do you cross the border?
not often >.>
yeah we cross often and they are usually paranoid at the border
Going to mexico they just let you roll
finished
Corevette789, but coming back...
Coming back you have to be strip searched
I'm really just kinda sick of being here, I'm sick of the way people here think, the way they act, how hot it is all the time, etc etc >.>
And if you're mexican coming back...
/me eyes BC
...
I cant handle the heat of the south.
BC is usually pretty mild in weather
I mean
in the lower mainland
i gotta go bye
It was kinda warm today
heat index of 105
Right now, the temperature is about 30
105 fahrenheit?
I like the fact you guys got lots of good guns down there though.
Very wet in BC.
Yes
kinda warm? >.>
rednecks are good for finding guns
NAh, it's not that bad
that's like 40C
Not bad in Michigan
!tfw
lol right
I can't even sleep when it hits 30C
76 as of now
Me either
you know you're home when it rains 70% of the year.
lol
/me doesn't like how easy it is to get guns though >.>
But thats rare and only for a day or two.
>.<
7o.o
that's the record as far as I know
"31C, feels like 33C" >.<
then you can own rifles and shotguns.
well
Handguns are restricted and a lot harder to get legally.
rifles and shotguns can be bought without a license if you have the proper justifications
/me has a handgun :3
/me has friends with CWL's
That are 15
Ive never heard of anything like that.
I'm pretty sure there's laws about sustenance hunting
Id like you to find it for me.
okay, hang on
I might be wrong though
We are extremely strict.
Why would a 15 year old need a concealed weapon?
Corevette789: School bullies
I mean, it is nice to have those guys around
except in hunting zones
in season.
and only rifles.
Handguns are only legal at the range.
I'm getting a CWL as soon as I can
That's not too bad
But of course that doesn't stop the gangs.
Lower murder rate
I would atrtribute that to Canadaians just being nicer.
:P
haha
I'd imagine,
quite a bit
since arms are really valuable
xD
'-'
oh
ahem
6it is
I was thinking of something else but even there you need a license
It costs like $444 to get a good, used, semi-automatic pistol
6I'm literally about to cry because I can't make sense of it
Id need to ask someone.
12o.o
are you interested?
my mom's got a pretty nice ruger
all I want is a rifle :I
but I'm not a gun person
07o3o
I'd take a revolver over a semi
Unless you fill out paperwork and spend hundreds of dollars.
Curly, why>
curly, like the Remington I showed you?
um, maybe? I don't remember
I take it a bunch of you know eachother irl?
no >.>
The one with the bobcat
Wooooooooo .357
oh, that one
I didn't like that rifle
D:
it looked too tube like
we have a .44
Why not ;-;
Oh
Targets or hunting.
like how to kill people
well, killing people is easy with a gun >.>
you don't even need practice :O
just point and shoot!
point at the nearest person and pull the trigger
just like Grand Theft Auto taught me
Ive been practicing
someone breaks in and you think they've got a gun
thank you deale xtreme.
my fav. weapon we have is a crossbow
You can get rid of them
seriously
I imagine a star type shuriken is only useful if you get someone in the neck
it's like a gun,
but massive bolts,
forced entry.
Yep
Theres no excuse for that kind of shit.
not as loud as a gun though for sure
they're a whole lot quieter than a gun,
even silenced
someone was breaking into my teachers hom
home*
I own a real bow too
that's fun
6it's probably the fact I'm running on no sleep in the past 36 hours
archery rocks
6I'm a little stressed lol
He used tricks he learned from bootcamp around Vietnam time >_>
I dont own a crossbow.
07o3o;
07this might help
I probably should get one though.
07O.-.o
/me 6gigglesnorts
6...
6ew
6I sprayed soda on my screen
07O.-.o
I always preferred bows to crossbows
just in terms of aesthetics anyway
I prefer collision weapons
collision weapons?
They're elegant, Curly :D
like,
Bows*
swords,
Bos
etc
oh
non-ballistic
well
bows are ballistic
Aye
Not a bow
a bo
ooooh
okay
melee weapons are nice too
I'm a mean fighter with a bo
I'm alright with a katana, too
Or a Zweihander
lol
but would be pretty brutal in a fight I think
Wha?
I prefer a rapier anyday
Unless you can weild one properly lol
cut them in half >_>
6cleaned it
they're really slow
/me 6gigglesnorts again
have you ever held one?
I read that claymores tended to be used like spears
I know they're slow
curly, they were more like axes
well
thanks
you heft it up and let it fall
hold the blade with one hand
hey
and stab :O
wb!
lol
/me is sooo close to falling asleep

Hm, look how informally he wrote that

XD
"Hey" ... "Pls respond to" ...
And he signs it "Rob"

Lol

I think you've written a program that reinvents everything we all know about computers
o.o
7problem is*
Awesome
I didn't know I was that good at programming
:D
:O
and I am the jester of Java
Can't I be queen of a language that isn't hated by most people?
That's awesome -- I'm glad he lost his license :P
Okay

Well... chances are it'll end up in the Computer History Museum. Which is a nice thing. Although owning it privately turns the nerd level from "low level geek" to "King of All Nerddom" :P
Hopefully no terrorists are getting ideas from this

That is an unfeasible solution, as that would probably cost more money. :P

/me explodes
/me ow
/me sits on Shena
04uh yes
04she has just set a curfew for staying up however
....
Its terrible.
04loooool
04I feel like playing some Spyro DotD
04but then I also feel like drawing
04and writing my FF
04:\
04kik
04lol*
04fff
/me has been too obsessed with Assassin's Creed 2/Halo ODST lately
04a pity they rushed it
I liked it.
04hey, I did too
But I agree
04but there were alot of places where they could have built upon it
04and melee combat is a PAIN
The melee combat was alright
Do you have the 360 or Wii version?
04I have the PS2 version
04x.x
Oh o_o Didn't know they made it for the PS2
04they did
04all the next-gen Spyro games have a PS2 version
04even ANB
04meh
04I just hate it how annoying it is to avoid
04not to mention you often fall off a platform when fighting and have to fly back up
Pfft, I never used dodge
04it's more tedious than hard really
If I was getting low on health I would fly away/switch to the other character
And I never played ANB
04neither
04I only have TEN and DotD
Me too
04but I'm sure it was released for the PS2
I didn't know ANB existed until after I had beaten TEN
04lol
04I still haven't beaten TEN
04it's freaking HARD
04looooool
04you really need to play ANB to understand TEN
04lol
I just haven't touched my Wii in weeks
04meh
04I've been playing DotD lately
04along with alot of my other PS2 games I normally neglect
04like R&C3
R&C is amazing
04damn right
04I've beaten #3 like, 14 times in a row?
A crack in time on the PS3 was awesome
04DAMMIT
Can an American be an illegal immigrant in Mexico and be deported back here?
04I want to play A Crack in Time
07yes
O_o
07technically...
04but I don't have a PS3
04only a PS2
04;_;
I do, but all I use it for is..... watching movies ._.
04lol
07but mexico would more likely keep the illegal hostage or something and demand money for their return
04yeah
I know he played them in the other games, but this one was really based on Clank
...of people to Mexico
04despite Ratchet saying otherwise, the series mainly focused around Ratchet
04but yeah, ACiT really bought Clank's past into the spotlight
Hopefully.
04I've heard they are going to remaster all the previous R&C's and put them on the PS3
</spoileralertfail>
04Like 1, 2 and 3
If they did that would be awesome
Especially 3
04Mind you it's just a rumour
I haven't beaten the first one
Its hard
04mmm
04I've beaten Ratchet:Deadlocked
04IMO, that was a bit too easy
Yeah
but it was entertaining
04the battle bots didn't do a good job replacing him
That did kind of disappoint me :/ Clank is awesome
04especially in #1 and Deadlocked
Lol, yeah.
04R&C: Size Matters
ToD
04Secret Agent Clank (spinoff)
04Quest for Booty
04plus it is focused more arounf puzzles
04around*
Ugh, I hated Quest for Booty
lol... "booty"...
'w'
04lol
hurhur
04fail naming
I hated these stupid puzzles you had to do on ToD (I think) where you had to move the controller around to make the ball light up the power switches or something..
04lol
Thankfully they took it out in ACiT
I didn't beat ToD actually beacuse of it
04lol
I'm gonna go to sleep nao

/me hides
6maybe it WAS 13
silverwing2000, I really don't care how old you are, you just don't act mature
which is kinda annoying
the same thing would probably be applied to an immature 19 yr old too.

6oh
I never noticed before, because my mIRC removes bold <--
I set it to XD
02Well...
well
it'll show bold for like one word
but nto for entire lines
*not
as that's kinda obnoxious
02Lol wow XD
if I typed entirely in underlines I'd be banned
/me hides
bold is kinda the same thing :/
I'm not

I never use Mibbit

I just never realized you were using bold LOL
6drf, you're always complaining lol

12Hi um
6A-R-T-I-BURD
12is Silverwing2000 banned or something?
6you should check my forum avatar
12Ok!
6....wut
03Is the quiz only for the forums?
HI Arti
no.
only Ninetailes was banned
12Weird, chat's not working for them
because she refused to listen to us
12Ohh....
/me 6runs
12....What happened?
12Logs?
/me 7reveals her lurkiness
12She you mean lol
LOL I would be
6I didn't hear this
um
14Arti did you get my text XD
6silverwings is a she?
I obviosuly don't have logs at work
12o-O
6-_-
despite me and a couple other mods telling her to stop 28 times
12Didn't you just kick her??
the frist time, yes
12Ninetailes didn't really listen
*first
then I banned her after she left :)
/me runs
12everything you said pretty much went in one ear and out the other
yep
that's the problem with little kids
12Wow nice avtar
12*Avatar
they don't know how to listen
12brb
/me remembers finding that a long time ago
12Also if you haven't already seen..
12http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5635
which is why i still think we should make an age limit
12Yeh I agree
14[21:16] <@Sneas> watch out for those Africans. they're good kickers <<< LOL!
12So I'll set one, 13 minimum
6oh
Awesome
6thank you -_-
14I agree with that too @Arti
10O:
12Yes
12Definitely
like I know PokemonStar is 11 but you would never know that
6PS is pretty chill
12It's only if we catch n00bs, then we can use age as an excuse to kick them off
XD
12No
12Like I said
6Ninetailes is also younger than the limit?
12If we catch them because they're n00bs, we kick them out because of their age
:P
6I thought she admitted to being 13
6......
no
02Oh, I thought you said Americans and then I was like wat
6HOW THE HECK DID SHE EVEN GET ONLINE LMAO
then again I don't really believe anything she says anyway
THAT'S MY POINT
12Me neither
7o3o
she kept coming in here and writing #RP
6that's younger than my brother X___x

/me remembers having that avatar a long time ago and all
um
Airwolve, it's probably ALL ports are blocked
except 80
I could try but whatever
02I actually still use it on my GPX+ account
I was using the TST portable one
02The quiz is only for the forums if you wanna join there
o.o
in normal operation more than just 80 is used by a computer
6you used this avatar? o-o'
well
12Oh
12O:
my high school blocked all but 80 and 8080
and whatever FTP uses
02Yeah lol, I even showed it to you a long time ago
21?
and 22
that was all they allowed
6I'm actually [retty sure I used it once too
6pretty
6sdisdhf
12Well
12It isn't letting me do anything unless I take a stupid quiz on GPX.
02Ah, they might've changed it

Sorry, I just wont let the conversation die =']
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM
Haha, yeah
but using a bulldozer to escape?
Now that's intense
That was mentioned in here yesterday too
or was it necrolounge or UESP
No idea
I think thats just.. immense idea tho. Don't throw hard things at hard men! Throw cute and cuddley as an insult
THEN proceeding the insults, escape in a way more manly then them
Exactly
Hahaha
This man. Is a genius.
He needs to get into standup comedy or something
Or warfare
Mayeb a mix of both =/
At the same time to

12I meant to say that if you're under 13, we'll probably catch you if you act like a n00b and then kick you off
12But if you're sensible we'll let you stay :3
Ok then,
12It's just n00b protection, although it's also against the law for anyone under 13 to join a forum but I don't care about that

10Hotel For Dogs was terrible
03my sisters like Hannah Montana -_-
03it's not?
12It's a.. movie for middle aged women
03it's rated PG
that IS horrible
03it's a "family" movie
Arti: No
12Not really, women watch it and think it's awesome
thats "its complicated"
12It's too boring for a family movie
/me dies
03XD
12Lol.
that movie was semi-hilarious
03Brother, I don't hate Hollywood as much as you do
03I really don't
03I'm a movie buff
12It's not a comedy, not action or entertainment.,.
03but I like action movies and sci-fi, involving PEOPLE
well they killed my child hood D:
12It's just.. how can I compare it to anything else? ovO
12Wahts the worst movie you've ever seen?
03that sort of movie makes me want to shoot the studio for even releasing it
03me?
12yeh
...Twilight
03HAH
LOL
Is the worse
By far
03I haven't even seen it
03but like
12It does nothig the whole movie except cause the man problems
03the only *bad* one I saw in theaters
03it's like, a live action story about Pocahontas
03only it's like 3 hours long
12LOL
o.O
03and it's fricking boring
03I thought it would be fairly interesting
03it's not
03at all
heck no XD
12I can't think of anytjing I can compare it to..
12Like um..
and the senseless drama
12No i really can't think of anything
/me runs
03but yeah, EW ROMANTIC MOVIES
03all my favorites are sci-fi/action
12It's worse than romantic
a history channel one?
03Brother, nah
03it was in theaters
03it's just fricking *bad*
03same with movies like March of the Penguins
I've never heard of it XD
03that would be fine as a TV documentary on say PBS
03but wtf?
I've heard of that
but I always thought
"why penguins?"
we've already got a BAD movie about them
Cause why not penguins?
*cough*thepenguinandthepebble*cough*
I want to watch a movie about ants, for two hours straight
03the only thing worse than childish talking animals is that plus DANCING animals
because don bluth killed penguins
Like a documentary
03it's just... shoot me now, please
03LOL
03well
03documentaries are fine, but most of them don't belong in theaters.
03Just put them on Discvovery Channel
03that's fine
Yeah
03-v
03so do I
But not in theatres
Earth and Oceans was good
03that was a good show
03back when they used to air it LOL
And it's not ALL about one animal
03Secret of NIMH was alright
and yet he went to levels like
Rock-a-doodle
seriously
12I only watched it a couple of years ago as well
12and I didn't make it to the end I don't think
never see rock-a-doodle
12Or maybe I did but I forgot the end
03it's NIHM
03er
03NIMH
12Yeh yeh
03not nym
12HAHA LOL
03I actually really liked the book
03even though it's about animals
Spirited Away is one of the anime movies that I'll never not like
12XD
03it's a lot deeper than that
it'd be like coraline
only it doesnt suck
03:P
/me dies
12THAT MOVIE SUCKED
which one?
12Ok not "sucked" but I didnt see the appeal
12Spirited away
coraline or spirited away?
12It's too stupidly random :/
I saw it
Coraline, I like Coraline
it was a meh for me
03Coraline looks stupid
12There's like, no plot.. well hardly
the book, coraline was good
the movie
03HTTYD was pretty good, Pixar movies are good
03most other ones, no.
03not at all.
12LOL I googled Rock-a-Doodle XD
12It looks crap XD
was like how jurrassic park was SUPPOSE to turn hout
Arti: I saw it
12Although it looks familiar somehow..
12Does it start with a sunrise? XD

Yes
12Because I swear I saw that once..
12-v-

03what was wrong with Jurassic Park?
03EW JURASSIC PARK 3
/me yawns
03that movie SUCKED
Drf: No no
03the first one was good
03the second was alright
03the third was like, WHY DID YOU MAKE ME WATCH THIS
jurassi park was suppose tp turn out like how coraline was
No
Nooooo
12I saw the 3rd in the cinema but was too young to remember anything XD
Not ever
only with coraline it looks as if someone stabbed me
yes
03WTF?!
*Gag*
03but eh
03Jurassic Park, the movie, is really good
03I can't picture it being different
I have, sadly, all 3 movies >>
they 'say' they are going to be making a 4th
Rumor
Rumors suck
03Nedry?
/me dies
Yes
03Brother, LOL, half of them get eaten
The one that hacks the security system
exactly
/me runs

03be evil like that
12Uh uh uh.... you didn't say the magic words..
03but I might work security for a park... XD

03Need I go on>?
No it was bad
...

Independence Day was cool
..XD
03yeah

03it's seriously my favorite movie
03-e

"well we're too stupid to think of a plan"
"so lets just wait"
03LOL
03well
03what would YOU do>?
Nothing

good, you?

we went shopping for fathers' day gifts
Casey and I are going to do that tomorrow after work
Got some chocolates and a rubber case for the HTC Incredible
Oh cool
liberal chocolates?
:P
lol
No
12roaraaaaaaa
He already knows about it though
Well that's cool
06breeeeeeeeeeee
12yay
What's he looking forward to about it?
is he into maing apps?
*making
or is he just excited at the sheer amount of things it can do?
He's not much of a programmer
x3
6Ohai, Rora.
6*late*
needs more e's
06breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

*some
is that enough? :P
for now
6Random comment: 'Happiness is fish love.' Ovo
HTC Incredible
And yeah, probably some
06wut
No
It's mostly theory I think
just the concepts
yeah
homebrew?
what's that?
lol
DS homebrew can allow you to go on IRC for example.
I should've known with you
:P
Wii homebrew can let you use play the radio.
oh cool
DS IRC
/me wants
me too
O.O
like how?
You could if you wanted to.
You touch the screen to control the mouse.
And use various buttons for other things.
woah, that's cool
/me wants to hack his DS now
Means you have to buy something though. :P
I'd buy it
how much?
:P
lol, if it's not too expensive I would too
06ra
The main use of it is playing pirated games.
But it can be used for music, and homebrew, etc, which is completely legal.
I'm sure it's something like that
looks like you also need a micro SD card
/me googles homebrew
I don't have one of those
I do! :D
They might supply one with purchase, check.
2^-^
I think I have an extra one even...
Ohh, yes it does
But do you have a microSD -> SD convertor?
yeah
/me yawns
http://www.r4ds.me/r4ds.html
06ra
Oh, and if you do get one, make sure it's for the right DS.
06hi :>
lol, I could see myself making that mistake
07ohai

/me spazzes*
2:D
2...
2wait
06yes there were some way dramatic parts
Unless I magically start making a ton of extra money
a 3DS or one of these cards?
2aren't there only 7 that were actually released in English?
3DS
2.... oh wait nevermind
2duuuh
/me 2facepalms
I'm really considering buying the flashcard

I wish SR had just sent me his extra one like he said he would lol
04lol
06yeaaaah
06but
:P
06it was pretty awesome
*the temptation to use it
SR was gonna send you one of those cards?
04oh
06Toy Story 3 was planned around Nemo/Cars time
06so they had to wait
Yeah.
06btw
04ah
04?
06Monsters Inc and Cars are both having a sequel
I gave him my school address and everything
But he never sent it
06MI 2 is going to be first
:(
was this a while ago?
14Monsters Inc?
06because that one's actually confirmed
arg a Cars sequel?
/me flees
HE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE! :P
I think it was like... October? November?
06there was a girl in TS3 that looks like a Boo a few years older (they always introduce a character from the next film in their movies)
2o3o
maybe school confiscated it

Nah
hey...
I think he just forgot

2you kill people
ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM
2that's what
that's all
2bbl again
I remember you telling me that
He had to steal one of his brothers' DSes to for it though
yeah
it was fun
I can't see him having one is all
He'd probably have one just for the sake of having one
.....
he's always buying random crap
yeah
the benefit of being rich
>.>
well look where it's got him
14LOL
Nowhere good.
14X3
Woo, found my USN.
USB*
yeah
USN, lol
Yeah, I was gonna say, what's a USN?
"Money can't buy you happiness", not yet it can't.
lol I agree with that actually dari
omg it's a nighthawk!
:P
heya
that would be false happiness though :(
cheated happiness
/me pokes at the hawk
/me pokes everyone
Yeah, I'm just saying I think that'll be possible not too long away.
o.o
yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
lol
if that really happened
in my opinion it'd be with good reason
I wouldn't like the idea of forcing happiness
And then, like everything else, people would grow to accept it and stop complaining
I agree though
I don't think it would be a good idea

hi
04how goes
okay I suppose
04i see
04http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/anotherfunmatch.png?t=1277032190
04i kind of raped that match
lol
nice
04i think my favorite kill was on ashe
rofl
04my favorite teemo kill overall though was in a different match
04i got killed and was waiting for respawn
THAT happens often :P
04yeah
04but his reply was like "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"
04i rarely put the traps in the path
some do it to farm mobs :P
04i usually leave them in the little trails that lead into the lane
04as a ganking safety measure
and grass :P
the grass is a good place :)
04yeah
04i usually put it right in front of the grass though XD
04so when they come out of hiding to gank me, they instantly got smacked
04forgot his name but he has endless rage as a ulti
....
i hate him :P
sure :P
04i hate him as well but if he uses his ulti
04then keep hitting him lol
:P
04i want to mess with Tristanna sometime D:
you got a free runeslot, glacy :P
really nothing to talk about huh.
humm
04i know
04but still, if used right, that is an advantage
and I never figured out if it effected her skills range too..
04i'm not fully sure
04i don't think it really matters
04the others i'm not sure
mmm.
it seems the ecnet servers are not resolving
bla @parents - afk for some more mins :I
back :)
/me pokes Quilava
/me squeaks
we wanna play now? :P

oh. and I could start pretty much any time. I'm just editing my playlist a little
adding another game's soundtrack

I like the sound of taht X3
think we should surrender? :P
afk - worldcup
Yush. :o If there ever were someone deserving of that title, 'twould be thee.
/me sits all over Kipikipo
gooo brazil!
:(
04Michel
hu?
04i surrender the second i can surrender XD
lame :P
04then if i get outvoted
04i just refuse to fight
/me pounces again
fight till the end! :P
*smiles and cuddles kipi more*
04if you think victory is out of reach you retreat :P
I lost a fight because someone refused to help even though it would have been 4v3 >.>
lol
07o.o
:(
annie or shaco? :P
04it's still possible to lose a match 4v3
huh?
left you alone i mean
pfft
rejected
oh
wut
*purrs*
/me pokes Mayra to pm
04it's harsh but when i don't feel like continuing a match, i don't feel like finishing it
Especially because half the time, you can win.
04and get a penalty? lol
/me hugs Cute_Riolu
hai
03rape.
04what are they going to do
Report you.
There's a report button now.
Cute_Riolu playing LoL too? :)
omgosh :P
Yeah. :P
I'm pretty sure they can.
they probably can
if you want to build a leave-name, go for it :P
*leaver
04but think of it like a police standard
/me sighs :P
I'd say the latter, honestly.
04i'd say the first, it wrecks everyone's mood
Well, they'll never get a handle on that.
ignore works well :P
04a lot of people aren't aware of ignore :P
Well, that's their problem. :P
04i'm just saying that if i can get banned for not playing a match
*problem
12o-o
Hey
04which is why i have no hope for this world lol
Not really.
/me just randomly talked to LugiaBot O.o
not sure
04so
14LOL
14NO
04i just make like 20 accounts
04and report them with each account
04they can probably trace the ip
04but it's something worth trying
04I would hope not .-.
Ugh, never mind. You're missing the point.
Are you sure? Sometimes they're... subtle
04i have good reasons for not finishing a match if i don't desire to
/me sits all over Kipikipo
14It was like
14"I live in Articuno's computer. Where do you live?"
14I was like,
14"Somewhere over the rainbow"
14But it cant
14I live in the 16th dimension
14In the 5th Universe
6Speaking of, is Arti coming today?
14On the 5th planet
Uh, yeah, they would. You, my friend, are the one being the crybaby. "Waaah, waaah, I'm losing the game!"
14Going somewhere~ Later.
14RAHRRRRR
04now you are missing my point :P
/me 6is getting Sine Qua Nons in AQ Oco [sic]
04in fact all i've done was lose games this week, i'll lose like 6 or 7 games in a roll and win one, then repeat the pattern and never complained, even if it irritated me
You stated yourself that if in a surrender vote, you are outvoted, you just sit at the base.
04yes
04i only surrender if i think it's impossible to get a kill without being killed
Yeah, well, he's wrong.
It doesn't matter how many times you die as long as you do that.
04sure that's the goal
04but how do you do that if you die every 3 minutes
04and feed their team
I've done it before.
Multiple times.
04you have to admit it's a lot easier if you don't do that though
04less money for them, less items
Not really.
04think about it this way
04if you die
04the match is temporarily 4v5 while you wait in respawn
04an advantage that can easily taken advantage of
04true
04it's still a possible win though
04my first ever real match all i did was die and barely contributed everything and my team-mates carried through lol
04and still won
/me chews on Kyu's ears
/me attempts to draw something
GOAAL
07nooooo
Which is exactly my point.
Don't be a douche and sit at the spawn point. :P
04at least at the spawn point i'm not feeding enemies lol
04:/
04i still don't like giving free money to enemies
04i don't want to be the one flamed for giving them that
You'll be flamed MUCH more for sitting around doing nothing.
04i'd rather be flamed for sitting around
04i'll have you know i've done that like 4 times
04even said i'm not going to play anymore
04and no one ever complained XD
04however i have been complained at many times for dying like 10 times and getting like 2 kills
And how would you have seen it if you weren't there?
04actually a couple times people joined me XD
If anyone complained.
04i'm in spawn point
04pretty much
04from time to time i'll actually pretend i'm doing something by laying traps around the nexus
04hey i wanted to surrender 8D
04ok
o.o
:3
sorry for that try on teemo - wasnt payingattention for a moment to kill his stupid shroom :(
04most of the time
Or 3v3
why did we just surrender?
because their they had 2 chars, that could own us 1vs3 already
teemo + yi :I
both nicely fed at the start of the gmae :(
<.>
04and that's why feeding is bad
1 week ago, you were trying to convince me from the other side - sacrificing to may-be kill an enemy etc... :P
04why
>:3
well unless it's a competitive match or you've "promised" to actually play serious/your best then I still think the same way.
lol
It is competitive.
04Cute_Riolu
Then RESPECT those people.
Unless you don't want respect yourself.
04respect is over-rated
/me sighs
04it's never got me anywhere lol
Um
It's never competitive by default
Espeon: It's like DotA, if you've ever played it.
Well I have
I mean, if people get mad at a videogame because of me when I'm not even provoking them then I see that as their problem.
Provoking is a subjective term.
Well there's a difference between griefing and using a "nooby gun" or something. I can understand getting mad at the first, but the latter is just lolable.
There's only one real 'mode' to LoL thus far, and the champions are oft-patched.
oh hey, my win percentage is exactly 33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333%
04playing his way is just a habit i picked up from halo
04if all i'm doing is getting killed then i remove myself as a factor, in hopes that my team can turn things around with me gone
then hit alt F4 and leave
at least early on
same here
I can hit them till they need to go back to base, but that's mostly as close as I get
they always escape with low health
but... in the last 2 games, you were good in that :P
even chasing past the tower and then abuse the range to kill the afk-guy :P
actually he had left the game/disconnected, lol
oh :P
moooo
my bet is that you either vanish or just stand there.
He bp's
xD
04BP?
and I dunno, it said he had disconnected
04like instantly
04?
maybe he was like. lagging or something
Blue Pill
04XD
04ahh
04then that doesn't work
No, it is not.
that's cord pulling
04with the 8 second waiting time
and that's cheap :(
It doesn't work that way.
You're just an easy target if you d/c.
I remember that games used to not record any stats if you disconnected. They clearly overestimated how fair people are
some games at least
note the 'take advantage of it' part
*COUGH*
04even if it doesn't work for me lol
04hacks are glitchs
04lol
..hacks are hacks
04hacks are hacks which also are glitches XD
*errors
glitches != hacks
this argument is pointless. I'm done.
Glitches are mis-coded segments.
04it is possible to prevent them though depending on how you have the server programed
04like if the server scans the program before it allows connect and if it sees a difference in the programming it doesn't allow the connect

2...?
2we are a clan now?
06wut?
idk
i found u on some clan thingy
2ah...
06clan....wut
soo ill take it as a no
06we're not a "clan"
we arent any type of clan
06but you can probably find people to battle with you
6Unless you mean the CaliClan. Ovo
06...lmao, quan that's excluded
guild?
06guild...
06wtf are you on WoW or something?
ugh
!uptime

The uptime of shadow.ambernova.net is 041wk 6days 59mins 39secs.
06well that's a horribly pessimistic way of looking at things
you may find people in here who've made their own friend groups, but not something to really call a clan or a guild
6What, talking is bad?
06we talk and enjoy time, we don't like focusing on one thing and one thing only
not if theres fighting
focusing on one thing is boring anyway
03hi
that's called role playing
06here we actually get to know one another
/me hands Quan a Demyx
06if that still works
6Ovo
6DEMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYX
06^^ it works
i jsut want to find a group that fights within it
we... THEY battle each other every once in a while, but as a friendly battle
06LOL how do you expect us to fight?
06I mean yeah...I can name a couple people I hate to no ends here

something more intelligent
lol
I said hey to you first
apes and monkeys are dumb
I've had a [censored]ty day now everything's making me [censored]ed off

I rarely see any of my grandparents
My mom's parents live in Louisiana

yip yip
12lol

/me is gone scribbling lol
hah
he/she/it said that dogs should have been the enemies in tlos because they're "more intelligent" than apes and monkeys
I wish I would have kept it
lol
lol
ick i'm not reconnecting with them.. we just argue and they criticize
I didn't know she worked
14yeh friends are here
03yeah she does
i had wolves >>
Not for me.
and I have a pretty diverse family.
19 year olds work you know
they're intelligent
they're like every other freaking animal
yes they do.
I don't really dislike anyone in my family; I just don't get along with them all
some of which are extremely opinionated.
everybody smells like crap
they don't throw it
they're pretty to look at
and they're not annoying
Like I'm pretty sure my only female cousin on my dad's side thinks I'm some kind of freak
rather hear that than an ape cry
lol
ask then
Probably

03:3
yeah it was around then
same day maybe even
hes starting to really lose his memory too
also only has one hand
I still remember my great grandma
I heard about that
She always talked about sewing
no i mean his name was G something
he was like 5 years old
he died around the same time as my grandma
:P
jk
I can sew; I just don't like to often
yeah
I did it for school once
I am awful at it
I can see Jenna getting into it
sooner or later
She does sometimes
Yep
She made herself a purse
looks pretty awesome
oh cool
heard anything else about it other thant the independant motion sword?
I'm surprised at how much Jenna has changed since I've been away
they haven't anounced anythig about the story
and in terms of gameplay that's pretty much it
And never used to like shopping or hate bugs
yea
hmm
Hmm, I was under the impression Jenna was always like that
Maybe as long as you've known her
Which isn't very long
i hate him
for the most part I agree
like the playstation's wii wanabe and the xbox kenect
:)
yeah
E3 kinda sucked this year
yeah
speaking of 3d i got my first view of a 3d movie the other day

Well keep doing it, then

I'll actually want to start sentences with "slash me"
I find it a bit annoying, though
/me dies from dying by dying for dying while also dying for death's deadly sake
/me shot on top of that
I have actually said LOL on the phone before >.<
It makes me think you made a terrible comment.
Haha

12lolz
I got that PM yesterdayy :>
pentium U5400...don't pentiums get realy hot, or is that just the pentium 4s?
12(emphasizing the individual teams)
lol
No
1.2GHz Intel Pentium U5400 processor
just the pentium 4
k
launched this year
oh i beat Cynder again
:p
the old pentium 4s were netburst architecture
slow and ate a lot of power
yea I think the U5400 is like 18 watts if I am correct
somewhere in that area
Nice
http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=49156
Is that it?
amd just doesnt give you the speed.
lol
n270
yea lol
mine 2.2 ghz
Proto, mariomaster
i think.
sleep well
:)
I'll give you 5 minutes to ask me something else I'm going to sleep
then its worth it.
lots of concurrent processes
it was power efficiency that it was doing really good on
id rather suck power and have a fast server then conserve power and be slow.
but it was priced a reasonable comparison to a zeon unit
xeon
xeon?
lol
yea
/fail
;)
I think xeon is aging now isnt it
you can use a i7 or something and thats much faster than xeon
I think there is I based xeons now
have not looked
but yea pretty much lol
Nothing?
and overclocking was quite easy and it works great.
I can't believe the cost for the 1090T
Nighty
yea I was looking at getting a 1055t ....
but I am just going to see about bulldozer next year

ati radeon hd 4770

just more vram
12ohai Roara~
i only hve 512mb of vram

o_O
only 512 ?
ack
