Laptop overheated. AGAIN.
Hooray for powering through three hours of sleeps and meds
You guys aren't taking this very seriously...
Laptop

Heres a thought
02Excuse me angel
They do make them, but they are netbooks
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMz9mbgNDyM
02Even tho it's not a battle song
It's a program that lets you make another computer
02It would fit good enough for one
But you have to have the setup disk for whatever series you're using.
inb4 Inception reference
Computers making computers? I don't like where this is heading...
Its just that my laptop overheats when I play games whiles its on my lap
Oh no, it's perfectly safe
/me rests his case
You set up how much memory you want it to have.
Gaming laptop is an oxymoron
I've now got an icepack on my crotch

03Most anticipated episode in this series, hopefully it's good XD
Triptans are the main drug used to treat migraines, but most doctors prefer prevenitive drugs
For all you sickies out there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8_pkvlcRTE
yeah, i havnt gone back to the doctors after i came off my anti-depressants
I was never a priority for migraine cases. I just gave up and took them.

10IMissOsamaBrony well whom is usually the object, not the subject. To say 'whom are you', 'you' is the subject. If you were to ask like "To whom am I speaking" then it'd be whom. It's not really a matter of what's 'proper'

Hi

http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3pywbMDbH1rvbl6qo1_500.jpg
6nick, a freshman is essentially the lowest level in high school and college levels (both schools use the same names)
Ponies47:if u did, Why?
yeah
6it's also used as an insult, as freshman are rather stupid
6most of the time
6like
6REALLY STUPID
/me runs
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m30q4oCE8c1r0zabpo1_500.png
6pretty much
xD
heh well that was me at uni this year, it was a Lot different from college
6when you're a high school freshman, you're still young and stupid cuz middle school is where they cram all of the young 6th graders with the older but not mature 8th graders
I don't know about "stupid" as much as "unknowledgeable," although there are those freshmen that think they are all that
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3jsswHTGz1r3gomwo1_500.jpg
both in high school and college
6by the time they're seniors, they're top of the school food chain and are very self centered, which is AWFUL to be when you enter college freshman status
6nah
6most freshman I meer are plain stupid
6as in
6they lack a lot
6in common sense
6A LOT.

6for one thing
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0eat3wgkw1r2ny42o10_250.jpg
6it depends on why you're getting drunk, in my opinion
6if you're doing it to have a good time, then fine
2Drinking doesn't always equal drunk though
6drunk personalities take on and amplify the emotions you have at the time of drinking
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
in terms of drinking, I drink sociably in quiet places close to home like pubs
6so if you happened to be angry and need a drink, you're just going to ruin everyone
YES!

Well, if you have /any/ ideas
03LOL
03you're welcome XD
You can bring it up
And the movie?
With whoever can give me permission to change the quit message
they could have borrowed some predator's masks..AvP showed those worked
