<RedDragonX> hey Dari whats up
<RedDragonX> gearing up for another wonderful day of work tommorow lol
<RedDragonX> and waching SR screw around with his chat bots lol
<RedDragonX> so what time is it over there?
<RedDragonX> you get up nice and early huh
<RedDragonX> well you were the other day lol...think I fed you about 50 quotes lol
<RedDragonX> I was falling asleep over my keyboard lol...had to bail out
<RedDragonX> umm
<RedDragonX> I think around 2:30 or so...I had to be up for work at 6:30
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> yeah well the Navy has at least given me the ability to go a long time with dismal sleep
<RedDragonX> you're telling me man
<RedDragonX> I never want to
<RedDragonX> but alas....life is life after all
<RedDragonX> so you on the forum too or just on the chat?
<RedDragonX> yeah
<RedDragonX> busy doing your programing stuff anyways I bet
<RedDragonX> well your smarter then me with em that's for sure
<RedDragonX> well I know SR does
<RedDragonX> have talked to him quite a bit over the last week or so
<RedDragonX> but needless to sa you you both know far far more then I ever will :D
<RedDragonX> lol...would be fun to learn about it someday
<RedDragonX> I don't eve know what that means @.@
<RedDragonX> lol...and IRC is what?
<RedDragonX> and that does what?
<RedDragonX> ok
<RedDragonX> and what is the point of all these channels?
<RedDragonX> and what's the point of having all these channels?...all of them are just different chat rooms and such?
<RedDragonX> So you can basically access a bunch of different chat rooms(channels) that are all part of this larger server in general(which I presume is epic-chat Webirc)
<RedDragonX> and all these are about pokemon or what...or is that just a codename or something
<RedDragonX> well that's interesting
<RedDragonX> so is that what you use instead of mibbit for example?..you use this mIRC
<RedDragonX> is it better then Mibbit?
<RedDragonX> how so?
<RedDragonX> which are?
<RedDragonX> wtf is that lol
<RedDragonX> and this is usefull how?
<RedDragonX> so it's like..keeping a history of what everyone says? or something like that
<RedDragonX> wow lol
<RedDragonX> so you have everyone's conversations and such?
<RedDragonX> so you can record even what mods say and everything?
<RedDragonX> and how did you learn to do this stuff?
<RedDragonX> so what would the text be if you wanted to record what I was saying?
<RedDragonX> ah
<RedDragonX> give me another example
<RedDragonX> yeah
<RedDragonX> wow
<RedDragonX> and that's helpful how
<RedDragonX> so what you just use it to screw around lol
<RedDragonX> ohh
<RedDragonX> wow..where the heck do you guys come up with all these lines of code
<RedDragonX> ?
<RedDragonX> whats that suppose to be lol
<RedDragonX> ohhh
<RedDragonX> yeah I just got that lol
<RedDragonX> that's strange...so if I wanted to pull that off...I would use that code you gave above?
<Spyrorocks`> RedDragonX: If you want to get into programming, mIRC script is not the language to try to learn.
<RedDragonX> Hey man I'm just kinda listening right now lol
<RedDragonX> but someday I might get into it
<RedDragonX> if it's so pointless then why do you use it Dari lol
<RedDragonX> I guess so lol
<RedDragonX> alright then SR what do you recommend then
<Spyrorocks`> http://www.bradsbox.info/nub.html
<Spyrorocks`> you can make dumb things like that.
<RedDragonX> who me?
<Spyrorocks`> Yeah hes stuck
<Spyrorocks`> On another firefox tab probably.
<RedDragonX> nah I'm here lol
<RedDragonX> sorry I'm doing paperwork for Coca Cola too
<Spyrorocks`> k
<RedDragonX> well that managed to fuck up my computer at least lol
<RedDragonX> anyways..what were we talking about?
<cynderlightlife> No idea. Just got here. xD
<RedDragonX> yeah remind me to not click on that next time
<cynderlightlife> I will if you tell me what it is. :3
<RedDragonX> umm
<RedDragonX> I think I'll just get back to filling out orders lol
<RedDragonX> I just learned that I can send you guys soda if I want to lol...oh woops nevermind...nobody here is in the USA lol
<Spyrorocks`> haha
<Spyrorocks`> canada eh
<RedDragonX> well actually I prolly could send you something lol...just a lot more paperwork
<Spyrorocks`> awww
<Spyrorocks`> How much?
<RedDragonX> depends on what you want lol
<Spyrorocks`> my dad would like some
<RedDragonX> He like Coka products?
<RedDragonX> Coke"
<Spyrorocks`> Yep
<Spyrorocks`> Loves it
<Spyrorocks`> drinks 3 bottles of coke every day consistently for as long as I can remember
<RedDragonX> haha
<RedDragonX> not nearly as bad as me lol..but still bad
<Spyrorocks`> no joke
<RedDragonX> I'm on my 8th right now
<Spyrorocks`> wow
<Spyrorocks`> thats crazy
<RedDragonX> yeah lol
<Spyrorocks`> I cant handle all the sugar
<RedDragonX> believe me it doesn't affect me
<RedDragonX> lol
<Spyrorocks`> I remember the year when we weren't allowed coke or pepsi because my mom thought the terrorists were going to poison it.
<RedDragonX> not even the powershots do anything for me now
<RedDragonX> well I never went that far lol...then again I was a big Pepsi drinker before I started working for Coke..naturally
<RedDragonX> but I just learned today that they are prolly shutting our plant down next year
<Spyrorocks`> I prefer pepsi over coke, coke seems too sweet for me.
<RedDragonX> Pepsi does have more sweetner in it
<Spyrorocks`> Oh?
<RedDragonX> more natural vanilla flavoring
<RedDragonX> and corn syrup
<Spyrorocks`> will you be out of a job?
<RedDragonX> Hopefully no
<Spyrorocks`> If it does i cant taste it.
<RedDragonX> I think I'm gonna be transfered down to the bigger plant
<RedDragonX> since I'm one of the few orderers they can actually tolerate
<RedDragonX> we work right of our houses anyways
<Spyrorocks`> ok thats good then
<RedDragonX> very
<RedDragonX> I use to be attached to the drivers
<Spyrorocks`> w00t my quad xeon server came in today
<RedDragonX> and they will be the ones out of work if they do shut it down
<RedDragonX> If you did want something though I would have to fill out an international request chit...enter it into the handheld...call the company to let them know just what I'm doing...sent out the T-Com order to whichever plant in Canada is closest to you..then hopefully within a tolerable amount of time it will get to you lol...and I would be out a couple bucks :D
<Spyrorocks`> How much does it cost?
<Spyrorocks`> and does the truck come here and unload.
<RedDragonX> depends on what you want lol...I could send you 5 cases of Coke 20 oz. for $40...and that's 24 bottles to one case so you would be getting 120 bottles at an average price of 33 cents a bottle
<RedDragonX> but I'm not sure where the truck would drop it..my guess is at the nearest Coke Plant of some kind
<RedDragonX> I think Dari would be a little harder to pull off though lol
<Spyrorocks`> wow
<Spyrorocks`> thats pretty cheap
<Spyrorocks`> so they wouldnt drop it off at my house then?
<RedDragonX> I'm not sure bud..I would have to check out just how they do it...when I place a personal order in for myself it drops it off right at the plant...but I think I can adjust it to personal addresses...something I would have to check on
<RedDragonX> yay me....another addition to my route...
<Spyrorocks`> lol cool
<RedDragonX> yeah It's a good job. Better then most out there
<RedDragonX> least it gives me reason to stay up late on places like this lol
<RedDragonX> So how did you fall into programing and everything anyways SR?..just pure interest I'm guessing
<Spyrorocks`> Always been interested in computers ever since i can remember
<Spyrorocks`> Started learning how to make websites with html when I was 11ish
<RedDragonX> yeah
<RedDragonX> I've never seen someone your age know so much about it
<Spyrorocks`> So far, I only know one person whos my age and a better programmer.
<RedDragonX> like I said
<RedDragonX> don't meet many like that
<RedDragonX> the only ones I know around here are all 20 plus
<Spyrorocks`> But hes asian, and you know the asians with computers...
<Spyrorocks`> Internet
<Spyrorocks`> dont know anyone like me IRL
<RedDragonX> Well one thing I can say for Asians...they may make some of the stupidest stuff in the world...but they take great pride in what they do..hence they excell to the max
<Spyrorocks`> My aunt is sort of good with computers... she wrote some software and tried to sell it...
<Spyrorocks`> but she failed after realizing nobody wants what she was selling.
<Spyrorocks`> Shes pretty cocky and outspoken all the time. Its annoying.
<RedDragonX> well...everyone except me in the family is computer inept
<RedDragonX> which is annoying since I have to set everything up
<Spyrorocks`> Multiply what you do by about 20 and you will see what I have to put up with...
<RedDragonX> well I'm not trying to outspeak you man. I know that you have a shitload of work to do..I can only imagine what it's like to put up with. I do the same thing just in different fields
<Spyrorocks`> huh? I am not trying to argue with you or anything
<RedDragonX> I know lol
<Spyrorocks`> Just saying I get phonecalls daily to do free work i am never paid for
<Spyrorocks`> and i cant say no to family
<RedDragonX> Just saying I can only imagine that amount of shit you do
<RedDragonX> I can say no to some of them lol
<RedDragonX> my aunt over in NY wanted me to come set up her new surround sound system and TV and such
<RedDragonX> Don't think I even ruturned the call
<Spyrorocks`> heh
<RedDragonX> but yeah with all this stuff you do with programs...must be a real boatload
<Spyrorocks`> Well, its fine once I get stuff going
<Spyrorocks`> and earning
<Spyrorocks`> then I can leave it alone and go do other things
<RedDragonX> Def earning
<Spyrorocks`> the annoying part is getting it tested and working
<Spyrorocks`> earning, as in getting money.
<RedDragonX> yeah I know lol
<RedDragonX> it's definetly making earnings..you just have to work pretty freaking hard
<Spyrorocks`> Oh I thought you meant "define" when you said def.
<RedDragonX> oh no lol
<Spyrorocks`> Yeah, I prefer projects I can finish and forget about.
<RedDragonX> yeah
<Spyrorocks`> Dont usually need to touch them again.
<RedDragonX> I hate leaving things incomplete
<RedDragonX> I freaking had to deal with the largest paranoid worker in our branch today @.@
<RedDragonX> he forgets shit all the time...leaves things incomplete
<Spyrorocks`> I find it hard to work on the same thing for more than a week
<RedDragonX> well..when you have so many different things to work on it can be hard to balance your obligations
<RedDragonX> same thing with me and dealing with multiple accounts
<Spyrorocks`> true
<RedDragonX> but keep a level head and keep moving forward. What matters is how we deal with our obligations.
<Spyrorocks`> gotta sort priorities.
<RedDragonX> yes we do
<RedDragonX> many times it's hard to maintain that demenor...but dealing with it calmly will sort things right
<RedDragonX> I have more then enough examples of that
<RedDragonX> told my dad about that nice discussion we had on the Peter Principle lol
<Spyrorocks`> Oh yes?
<RedDragonX> yup
<RedDragonX> very impressed with your knowledge about it
<Spyrorocks`> Interesting.
<Spyrorocks`> Stormy and DDR_Maniac were talking one day
<Spyrorocks`> about how they talk about me IRL
<Spyrorocks`> I laughed when they said they actually call me "spyrorocks" IRL
<RedDragonX> oh?
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> well I do the same thing with everyone online except my best friend
<RedDragonX> he is the only one I will refer to by name
<Spyrorocks`> Yeah ill go phone stormy and call her "stormy" whenever she talked to me.
<RedDragonX> it's a shame that most of the good people I meet seem to be online
<Spyrorocks`> It should eventually drive her insane.
<RedDragonX> you guys talk on the phone?
<Spyrorocks`> I need to go buy a new phone
<RedDragonX> well I know you are looking at that blackberrty
<RedDragonX> "blackberry"
<Spyrorocks`> her phone got munched by the washing machine
<Spyrorocks`> yeah
<RedDragonX> yeah I heard about that lol
<Spyrorocks`> I am going to go grab one
<Spyrorocks`> once I get my check
<RedDragonX> don't feel bad that's what happened to my old one as well
<Spyrorocks`> or checkS i should say
<RedDragonX> well I guess when you are use to names like these...kinda hard to fall out of it
<RedDragonX> those who know my name still refer to me as Red lol
<Spyrorocks`> haha
<RedDragonX> I keep telling them to use my name lol
<RedDragonX> I like my friends to know me by name
<Spyrorocks`> Whenever i talk to someone irl i met online first, I always bug them by calling them by their screenname
<RedDragonX> haha
<Spyrorocks`> it is extremely funny when they use a lot of numbers in their screenname
<RedDragonX> I bet lol
<RedDragonX> I have only met one person that I talk to online
<RedDragonX> actually two technically....but I don't talk about the other one
<Spyrorocks`> I met someone online that coincidentally went to my school (before I left school)
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> I flew out to Califronia to meet two
<Spyrorocks`> Yeah see, id do a whole lot more flying around if I could.
<Spyrorocks`> Just gotta wait until im 18/
<RedDragonX> well It's not like I can do it every day....but it was enjoyable
<RedDragonX> my best friend lives out ther
<RedDragonX> and....my ex..
<Spyrorocks`> nice
<RedDragonX> yeah...another experience that helped make me a much better person
<RedDragonX> needless to say I'm much more cautious when it comes to long distance relationships
<Spyrorocks`> Oh?
<Spyrorocks`> Interesting
<RedDragonX> it's a long story
<RedDragonX> I only trust it to my friends
<Spyrorocks`> OK, no problem.
<RedDragonX> but I do trust you..so I really don't think it's a problem
<RedDragonX> I went through a very painful two year long distance relationship with her
<RedDragonX> met her on an online game...and believe it or not we started talking a lot more then playing the game
<RedDragonX> I was 18 at the time...she was 15 I believe
<RedDragonX> think it was 2 1/2 years apart or something
<RedDragonX> but after a couple months we really fell into each other hard
<RedDragonX> which is totally against my nature...seeing as how I don't do internet crap like that usually
<RedDragonX> but we swore that one day we would meet each other
<Spyrorocks`> need to be careful since your 18 and shes 15...
<RedDragonX> very
<RedDragonX> believe me
<RedDragonX> but I was just out of High School
<RedDragonX> and I went right into the Navy
<RedDragonX> didn't talk to her for two months
<RedDragonX> which after everything was pretty hard to deal with
<Spyrorocks`> hmmm
<Spyrorocks> sorry
<Spyrorocks> disconnected
<RedDragonX> but I kept my promise to her that I would get out there
<RedDragonX> and It was this past June...I was 19 and she was 17
<RedDragonX> needless to say we didn't do anything because I'm not stupid
<RedDragonX> but it was without a doubt one of the best days of my life
<RedDragonX> 2 years of nothing but talking and we were finally together for an amount of time
<RedDragonX> its alright
<RedDragonX> but I only got 5 hours with her
<RedDragonX> then I had to fly back home
<Spyrorocks> looks like it thought you were flooding the chat
<RedDragonX> yup
<Spyrorocks> RedDragonX	then I had to fly back home
<Spyrorocks> last line i saw
<RedDragonX> well and we were back to where we started
<RedDragonX> talking on AIM every night from 10:30 to about 1 or so
<Spyrorocks> timezones?
<RedDragonX> that was my time
<RedDragonX> so yeah I was always three hours ahead of her
<Spyrorocks> oh i see
<RedDragonX> little rough on my sleeping patterns
<Spyrorocks> PST I am behind a lot of people.
<RedDragonX> but I was extremely commited to her
<RedDragonX> didn't want to leave most of the time
<RedDragonX> but I was warned constantly by my father that she was still young...and I def should have listend to him
<RedDragonX> needless to say at the end of this summer she had indeed changed
<RedDragonX> didn't tell me much and was very distant
<RedDragonX> to which I knew something was going on...and finally force her to tell me
<RedDragonX> she was dating another guy by that point
<Spyrorocks> and it all fell apart by then?
<RedDragonX> to me...almost everything did
<Spyrorocks> Well, you can't really compete if your not there i guess.
<RedDragonX> very true
<RedDragonX> but she lied to me about it
<RedDragonX> I much rather you tell me to my face then lie to me
<RedDragonX> and I put a lot of energy and time into her...and all and all I did lover her with all my heart
<RedDragonX> believe me I'm not like the average guy
<RedDragonX> I am extremely commited to my relationships...and I put a lot into them
<RedDragonX> but I slipped into a pretty bad depression
<Spyrorocks> Im so disconnected with people of my generation I don't know exactly what people do anymore when they "date" eachother.
<RedDragonX> yeah man I'm right there with you
<RedDragonX> but I couldn't eat or sleep
<RedDragonX> lost weight
<Spyrorocks> Thats one of the tradeoffs I made when I decided to get into business at my age.
<RedDragonX> well it's always gonna be tradeoffs
<RedDragonX> that's how life works now
<Spyrorocks> true
<RedDragonX> but thankfully my father was there for me when I needed someone
<RedDragonX> and my friends
<RedDragonX> I came around after a month or so
<RedDragonX> tried to get involved with places like spyroforum for example
<RedDragonX> and writing
<RedDragonX> just to be around people and develop some social skills again
<Spyrorocks> what did your father think about online relationships?
<RedDragonX> well my dad is a diehard realist
<RedDragonX> as I am
<RedDragonX> when I told him he didn't support it...but knew it was what I wanted to do
<RedDragonX> over time...things seemed to be working
<RedDragonX> we made it work for 2 years
<Spyrorocks> I guess I am the same way.
<RedDragonX> and he knew just how commited I was to her
<RedDragonX> so he supported us
<RedDragonX> she supported me going out to see her
<RedDragonX> "He"
<Spyrorocks> If you knew what was coming, would you have done what you did for the fun of it, or was the end not worth the fun you did have?
<RedDragonX> believe me man...the good times were the best feelings ever
<RedDragonX> those are what I try to remember and hold with me
<RedDragonX> in the end yes....it gave me an immense amount of pain
<RedDragonX> and I wish I could make it go away
<RedDragonX> but I did love her with all my heart
<RedDragonX> and I wouldn't take back the time we had together for anything
<RedDragonX> it has made me a better person overall
<Spyrorocks> If she ever approached you again, would you talk to her?
<RedDragonX> I'm much more wiser when it comes to such things
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> as it stands
<RedDragonX> I have not talked to her in 4 months
<RedDragonX> the only message I left her was this christmas
<RedDragonX> and I'll leave her one on her birthday
<RedDragonX> but I told her before I left
<RedDragonX> that I would stay commited for one more year
<RedDragonX> even though she isn't with me
<RedDragonX> I will leave the door open for one year before shutting it forever
<RedDragonX> I still remember several of the things she said to me
<Spyrorocks> Thats pretty cool actually.
<RedDragonX> "I can see myself with you 10 years from now...but for now my heart doesn't need you."
<RedDragonX> well she is stil young man
<RedDragonX> she isn't even 18 yet
<RedDragonX> she has much growing to do
<RedDragonX> maybe she will come back...maybe she wont
<RedDragonX> but I'm not leaving this open for long
<RedDragonX> I have my own life and I have to move on
<RedDragonX> but I loved her enough to give her one last chance
<Spyrorocks> Thats actually a pretty cool story.
<RedDragonX> because like I said .....I wouldn't trade it for anything
<Spyrorocks> I am glad you shared it with me.
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> I lke to share my experiences with those who care to listen
<RedDragonX> especially my friends
<Spyrorocks> I was never in the "dating scene".
<RedDragonX> well everyone is different man
<Spyrorocks> It just didn't appeal to me.
<RedDragonX> you dont' have to be
<RedDragonX> you're 15 years old
<RedDragonX> you have plenty of time to date
<RedDragonX> the problem with the world now is...everyone is convinced that if you start younger it's better
<RedDragonX> but the entire HS drama dating is a load of crap
<Spyrorocks> Ha, Im not saying im worried
<RedDragonX> no freaking teenager knows what they want
<Spyrorocks> just saying its not somethign im interested in doing just for the heck of it, like a lot of other people do when they are 15.
<Spyrorocks> AGREED.
<RedDragonX> yes they do
<Spyrorocks> Best statement ever.
<RedDragonX> but that's not the wise thing to do
<RedDragonX> who the hell knows what they want at 15 years old
<RedDragonX> relationship wise
<RedDragonX> what do you truly know at that age to even consider the thought you can control it
<RedDragonX> heck I'm 20..and it's still hard for me to control it
<Spyrorocks> I am screenshotting that quote
<RedDragonX> good because it's true
<Spyrorocks> Because its exactly how I think.
<RedDragonX> which quote are you talking about
<Spyrorocks> the problem with the world now is...everyone is convinced that if you start younger it's better, but the entire HS drama dating is a load of crap, no freaking teenager knows what they want
<RedDragonX> stop downloading lol
<Spyrorocks> I blame the media.
<RedDragonX> you can blame a lot of things man
<RedDragonX> our society has become so lazy it isn't even funny
<RedDragonX> most people can't get out of bed in the morning and go do a simple job
<RedDragonX> they have not aspiration
<RedDragonX> not reason to build themselves into so mething
<RedDragonX> not even to develop their minds
<RedDragonX> all that matters is how they feel and everyone should cater to them
<RedDragonX> Well Hail isn't exactly the sharpest tool out there lol
<RedDragonX> one quote that I do like using
<RedDragonX> Our country was found on the principle "Life in Persuit of Happiness."
<Spyrorocks> I think if anything, the media and teeny bopper tv shows do get into the minds of children/
<Spyrorocks> (Thats a decent movie)
<RedDragonX> it is
<RedDragonX> but the quote finishes with this
<RedDragonX> Now our country runs on the principle "Life garunteed Hapiness'
<Spyrorocks> hmmm
<RedDragonX> that's how the average person sees it now
<RedDragonX> they come to America so they deserve everything...they don't have to work for it
<RedDragonX> It's a principle that is decaying our society
<RedDragonX> nobody works hard for it anymore
<RedDragonX> nobody has any willpower to suceed
<RedDragonX> "succeed"
<RedDragonX> or better themselves
<RedDragonX> We all have to be "buddy buddy"
<RedDragonX> Have to freaking sugarcoat everything
<Spyrorocks> Agreed.
<RedDragonX> idk anymore man. Like my sister for example...she considers everyone she meets her "friend"
<RedDragonX> to me their is a big difference between someone who is your "Friend" and someone who is just an "aquaintance"
<RedDragonX> to me a friend is someone who if you were to pick up the phone and call them..they would be there for you if you needed it
<RedDragonX> regardless of what they were doing they would go out of their way to help you
<RedDragonX> but every single freaking person she meets is her "friend"...and of course being the teenage girl...she is gossip queen central
<RedDragonX> how many of these friends gladly stab you in the back to look good
<Spyrorocks> hmmm
<RedDragonX> I may have only a few friends...but I know I can count on them for the rest of my life
<RedDragonX> they would be there for me if I needed it
<Spyrorocks> how old is your sister?
<RedDragonX> and I would gladly return the favor
<RedDragonX> 17
<RedDragonX> and I have one older one who is 21
<RedDragonX> she freaking makes fun of me because none of my friends are around..and I have only a few
<RedDragonX> I just reply that every single one of her friends is talking some shit gossip about her right now..at least I don't have to worry about backstabbing
<RedDragonX> I just know how to pick lifelong friends
<Spyrorocks> hahaha
<Spyrorocks> All my friends changed after I left school.
<Spyrorocks> They are still my friends, but they aren't the same people.
<RedDragonX> nobody ever stays the same forever
<RedDragonX> if they do they are a very rare person
<RedDragonX> but if you find one...keep them close
<RedDragonX> but yea sorry..didn't mean to rant
<RedDragonX> that time already
<RedDragonX> what time you go to school?
<RedDragonX> I should have gave you another 100 quotes lol..
<RedDragonX> "When I die I want to go peacefully, like my Grandfather, not screaming like the six passengers in his car."
<Spyrorocks> need to sleep, good night.
<RedDragonX> night SR
<RedDragonX> It takes 46 muscles to frown but only 4 to flip 'em the bird.
<RedDragonX> Son, if you really want something in this life, you have to work for it. Now Quiet! They're about to announce the loterry numbers!
<RedDragonX> Car service: If it ain't broke, we'll break it.
<RedDragonX> There is a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot
<RedDragonX> Your mama is so fat, when she sings, its over
<RedDragonX> There are worse things in life then death. Have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesmen?
<RedDragonX> You knwo the speed of light: so what is the speed of dark?
<RedDragonX> Wear short sleeves! Support your right to bare arms!
<RedDragonX> What do Eskimos get from sitting on the ice too long? Polaroids
<RedDragonX> Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
<RedDragonX> Roeses are red, violets are blue, please flush the toilet after you.
<RedDragonX> but anyways time for me to take off lol
<RedDragonX> have fun at school!
<RedDragonX> Night!
<BlueFusion|ghost> no yer not :)

<gerpie> what is?
<Kjakings> 7I sniped her and then you slashed her up with a machette afterward to make it look like you killed her.
<EM99> Nope, butterflt knife.
<EM99> The machete is the official story/governmental propoganda.
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<EM99> *butterfly
<Cynder7> 6Eek
<Cynder7> 6AMERICAN DIOT!
<EM99> And I didn't "slash her up" I quietly stabbed the cartoid artery.

<Yahoo> Shuuuuun gerpie?
<Cynder7> 6._.
<EM99> *caritod
<gerpie> and what is never over/
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Yahoo> When?
<EM99> Whatever it isnever ends.
<EM99> it can simply be proven by the individual's perception of what an end would be inversed by the true fact of the matter which supplies the knowledge I have.
<Kjakings> 4She's supposed to be doing it now (the red text monetarily surprised me but then I remembered it be mah evile colour)
<Yahoo> e_____e
<EM99> Thus, it is a never-ending chain of those believing and not believing in a fictional end to any matter via their aforementioned perspective.
<Cynder7> 6O_______O
<EM99> So, "Let them eat cake!"
<RedDragonX> never let your younger sister drive the car
<EM99> LOL
<Yahoo> Lol
<EM99> What'd she do to it?
<Kjakings> 4I'm still 'looking', I have it on SC

<Cynder7> 6 /What/?
<RedDragonX> it's a little icy out
<gerpie> what is nevero ver?
<Kjakings> 7I would like to see someone literally wrap a car around a tree?
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<gerpie> over*
<EM99> The roads are undrivable here.
<Cynder7> 6How should I know?
<Yahoo> Lol
<Cynder7> 6Ugh
<RedDragonX> I wouldn't know I have never been on roads near you lol
<Yahoo> HAHAHA
<EM99> Kjakings	I would like to see someone literally wrap a car around a tree? it can happen.
<Yahoo> WRONG CHANNEL
<Cynder7> 6I REALLY suck at this
<RedDragonX> but seeing as how I almost killed myself this morning...again...not a surprise..
<EM99> Lolz.
<Kjakings> 4Yes.
<Kjakings> 4You do. :P
<Kjakings> 4XD JK
<Yahoo> Lol
<Kjakings> 7Meh. There's no way I can stop you (him, the rest of you most likely) and you'll put it back when you're bored with my un-responsiveness. And to be honest, you look better in black
<gerpie> lol C7?
<gerpie> maybe this pic for you on CA http://i147.photobucket.com/albums/r307/ladyonyx21/Anime/Guys/-anime-guy.jpg

<Cynder7> 6Hmm
<Kjakings> 7God. You're as bad as Ayumi and his stupid tripp pants
<EM99> 1. I have Tripp pants
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Kjakings> 4Wow. You really do have no life at all. Not even a virtual one beyond mibbit and hacking shit
<Cynder7> 6lol
<Yahoo> http://www.deviantart.com/download/102512632/__Tripp_Clothing_Me__Ayumi_2___by_Ayumi_Wolf_Dragon.jpg That?

<Yahoo> That's all in his scraps
<Cynder7> 6Looks kinda scary
<Kjakings> 7I like how she keeps pictures of him lying around handy for use, and then denies having any contact or liking for him at all
<Cynder7> 6..
<EM99> Cynder7	That was /Ayumi/!? No, it's was a fictional apparition spawned by the lack of connectivity of logic and reason, resulting in a cryptic realization that you have no idea what I'm talking about..
<EM99> And that you will die with 22 hours.
<Yahoo> And remember he had a snake?
<Cynder7> 6O____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________O

<Aicebo> 13http://forum.darkspyro.net/spyro/viewposts.php?topic=12718
<Stormy> I'm Catholic, and I've never heard of someone being "excommunicated" before.
<EM99> And anyways, Aicebo I was kidding I'm not leaving the RP.
<Stormy> o__o
<RedDragonX> oi
<Stormy> Aicebo, SR says to stop posting that link everywhere.
<EM99> But still, Mikey is way to insane of a fighter.
<EM99> it's from older times.
<EM99> They don't really use it now.
<Aicebo> 13Ok
<Aicebo> 13Sorry
<Aicebo> 13It's funny..
<Stormy> I don't know if they still do that anymore =P
<Stormy> It sounds like kind of an old practice
<EM99> It happened a lot during the time Martin Luther was seperating from Catholicism.
<EM99> If I remember right.
<Stormy> Probably
<Stormy> The Catholic Church was just a little corrupt back then.
<EM99> @Aic: it's fine, lol.
<Aicebo> 13EM99: I meant @ Stormy..
<EM99> M'k.
<EM99> But anyway, Mikey I'm still "at war" with those people.

<Cynder7> 6I miss teh Abbey..

<Kjakings> 7Dari: My name on steam is Kjakings, as it is everywhere
<Kjakings> 7And that's how I'll PROVE that the 'furries' you claim I 'love' I met on A GAME, because one's a mapper and one's REALLY awesome with a pistol and headshots.
<Kjakings> 7I hate you.
<Ember> 6O_O
<RedDragonX> hm
<Kjakings> 7Dari: How good are you at L4D?
<Kjakings> 7Because on the Dead Air campaign everyone was watching the plane crash I was the ONLY ONE who had the presence of mind to shoot zombies off of the broken terminal we were standing on BEFORE they climbed up and attacked us.
<Kjakings> 7Used most of my ammo, too.
<Kjakings> 7Indeed. And because I was out of ammo when the tank came and had to use my pistols, they claimed it was my fault we lost.

<Spyrorocks> You can make an internet "browser" in C++ with less than 50 lines of code if you use internet explorer COM object then embed it into a gui but its not really a browser you created, its just embeding internet explorer into a gui.
<Spyrorocks> http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/dan/1-08-09/jamin9306.jpg
<Spyrorocks> No, you embed an IE object into a gui

<RedDragonX> I want to throw my phone against the wall
<Spyrorocks> I should go into rogers and sit on the floor in protest until they bring me a blackberry storm.
<RedDragonX> The average women would rather have beauty then brains, because the average man can see better then he can think
<Spyrorocks> at the point I will calmly pay for it and leave.
<Spyrorocks> calmly*
<Spyrorocks> haha
<Spyrorocks> I like that one.

<BenevolentFacade> boy... a lot of hate out there tonight

<Spyrorocks> Its a mixture of hate and realism, with a little bit of humor thrown in the mix.
<RedDragonX> I got too many
<RedDragonX> dari knows that
<BenevolentFacade> sounds like spiteful feminism
<RedDragonX> I'm not a femenist lol
<Spyrorocks> too many of what

<RedDragonX> EVeryone has a photographic memory; some just odn't have the film
<BenevolentFacade> ha
<RedDragonX> I could've eaten alphabits and crapped out a better essay!!!
<Spyrorocks> If things don't go your way, just keep complaining until someone else does something about it. Thats how I got to where I am today.
<RedDragonX> Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died
<BenevolentFacade> most are plastic lol
<Spyrorocks> I tell my sister quite often I have heard better sounds come out of my ass then Miley Cyrus' mouth.
<RedDragonX> cause it's true lo
<RedDragonX> "lol"
<Spyrorocks> In fact I told her that 2 times today
<RedDragonX> If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?
<Spyrorocks> should we make it 3 to lower her self esteem even more>
<RedDragonX> If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?
<BenevolentFacade> hankypanky
<Spyrorocks> good one.
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: I know what we need. Some pokemans!
<BenevolentFacade> go pikachu!
<RedDragonX> Son, employers are like mules. Some you stand in front of and coax them along with a carrot. Some stand behind and kick them in the ass. The key to management is knowing which mules are which.
<BenevolentFacade> oi.. so long ago
<BenevolentFacade> employees or employers?
<RedDragonX> Car service: If it ain't broke, we'll break it.
<BenevolentFacade> lol
<RedDragonX> and it's employees lol
<RedDragonX> my bad
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: I think I know what is causing your problem.
<Spyrorocks> The abundance of microsoft products on your harddrive.
<RedDragonX> clutter
<BenevolentFacade> go firefox
<Spyrorocks> Well, it all starts when your computer attempts to execute code that came from microsoft.
<Spyrorocks> I say "attempts" for a reason.
<BenevolentFacade> well it all starts out when your mommy met your daddy
<BenevolentFacade> try getting 7 and not the beta
<Spyrorocks> who has IE 5 installed anymore?
<Spyrorocks> thats kind of sad

<RedDragonX> this one is the sequel
<Spyrorocks> Oh man i just remembered
<Spyrorocks> they idiots still haven't shipped my new aspire one back
<RedDragonX> 0.o
<RedDragonX> SR did you want to see the story?
<Spyrorocks> Im reading that thread about bullying
<RedDragonX> the one that Justin Long Fan put up?
<Spyrorocks> I dont remember who
<Spyrorocks> Im remembering something my wrestling coach told me.
<RedDragonX> Yeah I tried to give him some good advice on that
<Spyrorocks> "No one has the right to hurt you."
<Spyrorocks> His name is Paul, hes probably one of the biggest guys you will meet.
<RedDragonX> I don't know I have met some pretty big ones
<Spyrorocks> thats why I said "one"
<RedDragonX> yeaaaah
<RedDragonX> the military kinda has em everywhere @.@
<Spyrorocks> hes pretty funny
<Spyrorocks> quote
<Spyrorocks> "Your parents don't pay big money so you can come here and lose fights."
<RedDragonX> haha
<Spyrorocks> I laughed at that one for a while.
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> sounds like a cool guy
<Spyrorocks> Yeah he tells it like it is.
<RedDragonX> good
<RedDragonX> that's what we need in this world
<Spyrorocks> what sort of unarmed stuff do you learn in the military?
<RedDragonX> as in self defense?
<RedDragonX> mach takedowns mostly...non lethal close combat
<Spyrorocks> whatever you do.
<RedDragonX> paralyzing
<RedDragonX> breaking
<RedDragonX> I know just about all of em
<Spyrorocks> cool
<RedDragonX> yeah...only have gotten the chance to test it once...but it works
<Spyrorocks> I don't do anything for "self defense", just do it because its fun.
<Spyrorocks> Oh? Is there a story?
<RedDragonX> well one guy tried to go after my sister
<RedDragonX> yeah a little one
<Spyrorocks> So far I seem to like your stories, continue :)
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> I think it's when she was a junior
<RedDragonX> I was just out of A school
<RedDragonX> but apparently she got in a pissing match with one of her best friends ex boyfriends
<RedDragonX> big kid
<RedDragonX> prolly about 6'4' or so
<RedDragonX> but he was aggressive as hell
<RedDragonX> and not to mention mentally unbalanced
<Spyrorocks> I know the type.
<RedDragonX> but I heard them arguing (I was picking her up)
<RedDragonX> got out of my car and got between them
<RedDragonX> and told him that if he touched her I would fucking kill him
<RedDragonX> not usually my style...but he was getting bad
<RedDragonX> that and nobody messes with my family
<RedDragonX> so he went at me
<RedDragonX> I broke his wrist, twisted his arm...then wrapped my arm around his neck ready to snap it
<Spyrorocks> sounds like fun.
<RedDragonX> needless to say he is really lucky I didn't kill him
<RedDragonX> but it's not something I like doing
<RedDragonX> I do it when I have to defend someone or myself
<RedDragonX> but I would never a fly...I prefer to help people
<RedDragonX> never "harm"
<Spyrorocks> i see
<RedDragonX> just wanted to protect my sister

<draco_the_dragon> 4bump
<Cynder7> 6ok
<Cynder7> 6O_
<Cynder7> 6Hey SR
<Spyrorocks> Oh man
<Spyrorocks> that was one of the worst walks I have ever taken
<Spyrorocks> So, all the snow around here is melting
<Spyrorocks> so we have big pools of water all over
<Cynder7> 6Oh
<Cynder7> 6That does suck..
<Spyrorocks> theres this one pool of water thats about 1.5 feet deep
<Spyrorocks> and I sware it was at the most 0 degrees C
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Cynder7> 6Wow
<Kjakings> 7And you jumped in?
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Spyrorocks> so, theres this strip of ice and snow
<Spyrorocks> going across
<Cynder7> 6Lol
<Spyrorocks> so me, being who I am, try to walk across
<Spyrorocks> I get to the middle
<Spyrorocks> and slip a little, and all the ice and snow collapses
<Spyrorocks> and I fall right in
<Spyrorocks> I cant feel my feet
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Cynder7> 6D=
<Kjakings> 7That's so hard a fail, it's gotta be a win
<Spyrorocks> For some reason I knew I was going to fall in but walked across anyways
<gerpie> ow ehy sr
<Spyrorocks> and of course, everyone else laughs and takes pictures of me.
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Spyrorocks> I managed to stick my hand out so my upper body didnt get wet.
<Spyrorocks> I should have just went swimming anyways for the fun of it.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Rurik> 4u tarded now
<Kjakings> 7I need to get a hold of those pictures.... somehow.
<Spyrorocks> At least I would have got to stay in a nice warm hospital bed after they treat me for hypothermia.
<Spyrorocks> Yes Rurik , I tarded.
<Spyrorocks> They are not as funny as you might think they are
<Spyrorocks> I just have that "too cold" expression on my face.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but a shot of your face would be worth millions (maybe... not...)
<Kjakings> 7I could sell it to DFOKN, and he would probably give me real monehz
<Spyrorocks> worth millions to the first person, but I have a feeling it would decrease in value quite quickly.
<Rurik> 4after he mods it
<Spyrorocks> I was going to photoshop that pic of aicebo and put some guns and money in the background or soemthing because it looks like shes trying to look like a gangster.
<Kjakings> 7SR: So I sell it to 5 people at the same time, then there a five 'first' people
<BenevolentFacade> back
<Rurik> 4do it
<BenevolentFacade> sup coke man

<Spyrorocks> I Have a problem with everyone
<BenevolentFacade> haha coke man
<RedDragonX> hey everyone
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Kjakings> 7SR: You don't count.
<Spyrorocks> Especially aicebo.
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<RedDragonX> what I miss?
<Spyrorocks> nothing.
<RedDragonX> ah
<BenevolentFacade> something about donuts and a bi
<RedDragonX> well..that's certainly interesint lol
<RedDragonX> "interesting"
<BenevolentFacade> good he didnt die
<Cynder7> 6Wb
<EM99> Yup good thing.
<EM99> Sorry I got off, i died and then cme back to life.
<EM99> *I came
<Kjakings> 7You can do that?!
<Kjakings> 7Damn, the plans will have to be altered.
<EM99> Psssh, all Etherals can.
<Kjakings> 7I uh mean... You can do that?!
<Cynder7> 6O_O
*Rurik 4shoots him to see if it is true
<EM99> *ethereal
<BenevolentFacade> we have technology, we can rebuild him
<BenevolentFacade> but we dont want to spend alot of money
<EM99> I'm more machine than man now.
<BenevolentFacade> lol at family guy
<Kjakings> 7family guy is EPIC
<EM99> Yup.
<EM99> Yes it is.
*EM99 just notices a bullet in his forehead and pulls it out.
<EM99> Wow, when did that get there?
<RedDragonX> yeah it will successfully dull your attention span for a good 30 minutes with funny shit
*EM99 cliched Wolverine rgeneration heals the wound.
<EM99> *regeneration
<Kjakings> 7Now then. If you regenerate, what would happen if I totally disintegrated your body?
<EM99> I couldn't
<EM99> I'd just die
<Kjakings> 7Indeed?
<BenevolentFacade> Inyuk-chuk
<EM99> But luckily I'm Ethereal so I'll never be disinegrated.
<Kjakings> 7Ethereals can't teleport, right?
<Cynder7> 6Ouch
<EM99> Well, they are omnipresent.
<Kjakings> 7That does not answer my question
<EM99> Consciously, not physically.
<EM99> Sure ti does.
<EM99> It means no, but they have something better.
<Kjakings> 7Good. Then the plans can go forward. Total obliteration of the Ethereals will go forward as planned. The Borg will be here within two weeks, the Replicators and Manytes six hours after.
<Kjakings> 7Wait, can I rephrase that first part?
<Kjakings> 7I made a total hash of it
<BenevolentFacade> oi
<EM99> No.
<EM99> The plan's already in motion.
<EM99> There's no going back.
<Kjakings> 7It's called a double-cross, you ignorant fool. The Ethereals will be defeated, no matter what you say.
<EM99> Well, in that case, I'll ahve to use the elupheus to decimate you first.
<Kjakings> 7Now then, will you acquiese, or will you resist like those other fools? Resistance is futile Neon, you should know that.
<EM99> It's not resistance when you have the upper hand.
<EM99> Shit, see what you've done?
<EM99> You've stuck a song in ym head.
<EM99> *my
<Kjakings> 7The upper hand? We are bringing about the full force of the borg, Replicators and Manytes. The full force of the Borg alone could decimate all of the Alpha Quadrant, excluding the annoying influence of Star Fleet.
<BenevolentFacade> uh
<Kjakings> 7Add in the Replicators and Manytes, and the Stargate Program will be over-whelmed by invaders. We have an alliance with Michael and the other wraith too if you must know
<Kjakings> 7Atlantis will fall.
<EM99> SG won't allow this.
<Kjakings> 7SG?
<EM99> Star gate.
<EM99> The sentient mind of SG won't allow this.
<Kjakings> 7Were you not listening fool? Go back and re-read the post
<Kjakings> 7... The Stargates have no sentient mind. You're thinking of the Tardis
<Cynder7> 6...
<BenevolentFacade> ...
<EM99> They do ever since we added them to the Harvester IV series.
<Cynder7> 6What time is it where you guys are?

<kjakings> 7Go learn what sarcasm is, n00b
<DDR_Maniac> That must be satisfying
<DDR_Maniac> He's very insulted; you called him a "n00b"
<kjakings> 7Dari: I think we have a different definition of n00b. Mine is the correct one, go look it up on wikipedia.
<DDR_Maniac> Anyway...anyone else here who isn't arguing
<Rurik> 4I here
<Rurik> 4barely
<Rurik> 4but I here
<DDR_Maniac> Hello
<kjakings> 7That's it dari, you string a bunch of offensive words together and hope it makes an insult.
<Yahoo> Kieran
<Aicebo> 13RAWR>
<DDR_Maniac> kjakings: you do that /all/ the time
<Yahoo> Gah
<DDR_Maniac> Hi Aicebo
<Yahoo> You scared me /sarcasm
<Aicebo> 13lol
*Aicebo 13finished organizing favorites on dA
<Yahoo> Plus, you are a n00b if you call others n00bs
<Aicebo> 13No...
<DDR_Maniac> How is being called a n00b an insult? :P
<kjakings> 7Yahoo, that is calling someone a n00b, therefor by your own theory you are calling yourself a n00b.
<Aicebo> 13You're a n00b if you're a n00b and you call a "senior" or respected member a n00b.
<BlueFusion> BTW guys... http://chat.epic-chat.net/spyrochat is another way to get to this channel from the web.
<Yahoo> I didn't call asnyone a n00b I was making a statement
<Aicebo> 13BlueFusion: That's cool :D
<kjakings> 7Your theory states that people who call people n00bs are n00bs themselves, correct?
<Yahoo> Correct
<kjakings> 7Therefor, you are calling people who call people n00bs n00bs, therefor you are calling yourself a n00b by your own theory. I understand if you're not intelligent enough to understand that, Abbey wasn't.
<Yahoo> Lol
<BlueFusion> CLONES DETECTED Test // Aicebo
<BlueFusion> erm soz lol
<Yahoo> It isn't my own theory Kieran
<kjakings> 7I don't care. It's a theory you support
<Yahoo> Lol
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Aicebo> 13I was testing the link you gave us
<kjakings> 7Whenever I tried to explain that to abbey, she did her stupid sexist away messages and then drowned out everything in 'LOL's.
<kjakings> 7Nerd.
<BlueFusion> Aicebo, yep.
<DDR_Maniac> Mindless insult, Kjakings
<DDR_Maniac> :P
<kjakings> 7Not really mindless, because it's true. Come on here a bit more often before you pass judgement on people, kthx
<DDR_Maniac> I've heard about you from other people, and argued with you a couple times already
<kjakings> 7I actually have a reputation? Cool.
<DDR_Maniac> Not a good one, but a reputation, yes.
<kjakings> 7Lol.
<kjakings> 7Hey dari, you got GHWT, right? I got mine yesterday. =D
<kjakings> 7I need to practise loads on the guitar before I get back up to the level I was. And I hate the drums.
<kjakings> I can't even do Eye of the Tiger on easy on drums which is just red and yellow repeatedly with the occaisional orange and blue.
<kjakings> Yes. I suck lots on drums
<kjakings> Lol
<kjakings> 7If you feel like losing, then we could have another argument (forgot mah orange :P)
<Rurik> 4here we go...
<DDR_Maniac> Now lets have an argument on who won the argument!
<DDR_Maniac> -__-
<DDR_Maniac> XD
<kjakings> 7You didn't 'win', you declared you won and then completely ignored me until the subject was changed
<DDR_Maniac> Lol Kjakings
<kjakings> 7Bullshit.
<kjakings> 7That doesn't count, I was pointing out that Yahoo was calling herself a n00b, although she doesn't really need to. The evidence speaks for itself
<kjakings> 7Whatever
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> So Dari wins the argument
<Yahoo> Nah
<Yahoo> Kieran's little paddies keep this place alive
<kjakings> 7Dari, the evidence is obvious she /likes/ you, constantly agreeing, and even though she denies it I got her to admit she does.
<Yahoo> Oh not this again..
<Yahoo> IT WAS AIMED AT YOU KIERAN
<kjakings> 7If you say so.
<kjakings> 7I don't even remember what you said, I just got you to admit you like dari
<Yahoo> You are SO lucky charlie isn't here
<kjakings> 7Whether or not the feeling's mutual is a debatable subject
<Rurik> 4he the father?
<Yahoo> Lol no
<kjakings> 7Rurik: No, charlie's a girl. :P
<Yahoo> Charlie insists that I fancy Kieran
<Rurik> 4oh
<kjakings> 7Yahoo: o_O THE HELL?!
<Rurik> 4I knew Yahoo had the hots for her
<Yahoo> That was my reaction
<kjakings> 7I scared now.
<Yahoo> but I screamed it
<Yahoo> I did piss her off by shouting (sorry aicebo) CHARLIE X MICKEY FTW!
<kjakings> 7Dari: Naw, I tricked her into admitting she likes you, and if you simply gather the evidence you see the truth.
<Yahoo> Ya
<Yahoo> That's it
<Aicebo> 13.....
<Yahoo> I can and WILL get charlie onto xFire
*Aicebo 13is pissed.
<Yahoo> Sorry
*Rurik 4doesn't care
<Yahoo> Doesn't count, it wasn't on the same line
<kjakings> 7Wuss. He, doesn't want to hear the evidence so he pisses off aicebo and runs
<Yahoo> 17:17 Rurik yes, I am so much of a pansy...
<kjakings> 7Sarcasium?
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> Good timing Kieran
<Rurik> 4oh shut up. At least I know I can't spell
<Yahoo> We will see about that
<Yahoo> First one to make a typo is a pansy alright rurik?
<Rurik> 4I'm Dyslexic. Of course I am gonna make a typo. And I hit wrong keys
<kjakings> 7Rurik tarded? :P
<Rurik> 4-.-
<Yahoo> Haha.

<Rurik> 4 50 :P

<Deathbat> 10owiesplz
<kjakings> 7"The songs you play", go do it on 6 random songs.
<kjakings> 7Suuuuuuure.
<kjakings> 7Suuuuuuure.
<kjakings> 7If I say no, you'll make some comment and most likely start an argument, if I say yes, you'll most likely do the same thing. So I'm not going to respond and just say "You didn't miss much, just SR being pwnt by Stormy at Mariokart DS"
<kjakings> Fiver says he's letting her win.
*Stormy eyerolls
<kjakings> 7Lol. I don't respond and he starts an argument.
<Spyrorocks> I didn't expect that id have a chance.
<Stormy> Only because it picked Mario's kart for me the second round :P
<Stormy> I never use that one
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, then I won like 2 rounds.
<Onyxia> Whoop?

<Yahoo> WOw
<Yahoo> I havent been outdoors since friday
<kjakings> 7IE sucks
<Deathbat> 10Yes it does.
<kjakings> 7oh... Lol.
<Deathbat> 10I got firefox literally a few minutes ago and I am already finding it quite hilarious :3
<Rurik> 4O_o
<Rurik> 4I have no issues with IE
<Deathbat> 10I THINK I MADE MAH POINT :D
<Yahoo> Gotta restart
<Yahoo> brb
<Deathbat> 10SHOE
<Deathbat> 10SHOO*
<Deathbat> 10PAHAHA Fail.
<BlueFusion> wtf
<BlueFusion> why are you nongs using IE
<BlueFusion> use firefox or google chrome dudes :P
<Rurik> 4lazy
<BlueFusion> Dari, like what
<BlueFusion> anyway if ur lazy
<BlueFusion> use firefox
<BlueFusion> it's way faster
<BlueFusion> how do you mean it "needs" it
<RedDragonX> firefox is better
<Deathbat> 10Whats Steam?
<Deathbat> 10I cba to go find out. :P
<BlueFusion> Deathbat, a game distribution platform
<BlueFusion> basically, you buy a game thru it and u can play the game on any PC with steam that you log in to
<Deathbat> 10Ohhhh.
<Deathbat> 10IE just crashes on me all the time :(
<BlueFusion> Dari, steam doesn't "need" IE any more than Windows does... the entire operating system is built around the browser, literally
<BlueFusion> so it's literally impossible to uninstall it
<BlueFusion> yeah - cos steam uses a browser engine that IE provides :P
<BlueFusion> Dari, have you run a virus scan
<BlueFusion> if you haven't, download and install and run the latest AVG or NOD32
<Yahoo> AVG annoyed me
<BlueFusion> It's worth 8 hours to save a complete reinstall isn't it?
<BlueFusion> Dari, in your dreams.
<BlueFusion> NOD32 is _the_ best, AVG is a close second.
<RedDragonX> lol
<BlueFusion> I'd be asking you that.
<BlueFusion> If you think AVG is crap, you clearly have too many viruses for it to do a clean install
<BlueFusion> A lot of viruses try to prevent antivirus progs being installed.
<Deathbat> 10OH FXCKING CHIHUAHUA CLOUDS!!!
<BlueFusion> If you install it with a fresh windows, it does the job faster and more efficiently than almost any other.
<Deathbat> 10... eep
<BlueFusion> And now you've got this problem
<BlueFusion> Suffice to say, you fucking moron.
<BlueFusion> And if you had left AVG you wouldn't have this problem
<Yahoo> Wow. Iam Typing By Writing
<BlueFusion> May I ask how you think it is 'crap'?
<Yahoo> LOL
<Yahoo> I like this tablet function
<Deathbat> 10Yahoo: ...OO.
<BlueFusion> lmao
<BlueFusion> "infections in the registry"
<BlueFusion> define this plox
<BlueFusion> what scan thing
<BlueFusion> one mo
<Deathbat> 10*dies*
<BlueFusion> yeah, you ever loaded spyroforums in internet explorer?
<BlueFusion> (didnt mean to click that button lol)
<Deathbat> 10Wow.
<BlueFusion> uh.
<BlueFusion> well if you had IE 5
<BlueFusion> i wouldn't be complaining about viruses boy
<BlueFusion> the best thing you can do to protect against viruses is keep windows up to date
<BlueFusion> doesn't matter
<BlueFusion> it was running
<BlueFusion> it's part of the OS, dude
<BlueFusion> at this point I would suggest you backup your important files onto a blank disk / drive, scan it with MBAM on another PC
<BlueFusion> then format ur drive and reinstall windows
<BlueFusion> because there's almost no chance of getting it working again without a lot of work, soz
<BlueFusion> exactly.
<CynderRules> vai handikapata her death! first learn to play and after, and can plagieze, however great "singer" Vanessa Hudgen pulii copied from a song-zone ... shameful
<BlueFusion> Dari, there's most likely rootkits and viruses in a lot of your files, like 60-90%
<BlueFusion> seriously, format and reinstall
<CynderRules> gah
<CynderRules> trying to translate that bit of text
<CynderRules> vai handikapata her death! first learn to play and after, and can plagieze, however great "singer" Vanessa Hudgen pulii copied from a song-zone ... shameful

<Deathbat> 10And didn't Stephen have an affair with Helen?
<Deathbat> 10Wow, its all coming back! ^_^
<Yahoo> One of my favs is when the girl is trying to push her dad over and she kicks him in the balls and it works
<kjakings> 7Dari: Wait... didn't she already clone him? Or was that that guy who got ripped to shreds by a velociraptor and kept coming back?
<Deathbat> 10...
<kjakings> 7"Yes" would've sufficed
<kjakings> 7Whatever happened to Rex? He was awesome.
<Deathbat> 10Especially when he puked on the mean mans back ^_^
<Rurik> 4O_o
<kjakings> 7I like when they were trying to catch Rex in one of the early season 1 episodes and he got in the elveator and he was dancing to the music.
<kjakings> 7Dari: Yeah, but I asked a descriptive question, you only need a simple answer for a descriptive question, as long as it's not an annoying or stupid answer like "He's the one who all the girls like." or "Guy who dies"
<kjakings> 7Ok, you go completely ignore what I just said and be a dickweed
<kjakings> 7Hey dari (I've probably asked you this already) but what happened to the Zombie Horde 2 hax I wanted you to do?

<Aicebo> 13I watched my cousin and his friends play that a couple days ago
<Aicebo> 13I don't even see how you can be serious about it Zombies with bulgy eyes jumping out at you with you using a gun is too hilarious to concentrate.

<Aicebo> 13lol.
<Aicebo> 13Well it looks nice.
<Aicebo> 13I like the art style.
<kjakings> 7Dari: If you can host a server or want to go on single player, go to console (hit the `/ key) and type in sv_cheats 1 and hit enter, then type in Z_health_100 for double health zombies.
<kjakings> 7Or replace 100 with any number you want. Do the 7x more zombies cheats for epicness.
<kjakings> 7For health type in give health, give first_aid_kit (obvious), give rifle (assault rifle), give pistol for dual wielding pistols.
<kjakings> 7And all the special infected you need to do seperately, like z_tank_health numberhere (and no underscore between numbers, my bad) etc.
<kjakings> 7Wait, no. No underscore between commands and numbers.

<Aicebo> 13lol
<Spyrorocks> That was fast..
<Spyrorocks> What does your sister do? Play games?
<Stormy> Neopets, club penguin, email friends....
<Stormy> We're only supposed to get a half hour each from 3-4:30
<Aicebo> 13That sucks.
<Spyrorocks> My brother used to have a club penguin account
<Aicebo> 13I still go on CP when no one's on and I'm REALLY bored, lol
<Spyrorocks> he probably still does have it, auto renewing on my moms credit card she forgot about
<Stormy> I really don't see the point of club penguin
<Aicebo> 13LOL
<Stormy> It's just like
<Stormy> "R U TAKEN!?!"
<Aicebo> 13Lolwtf?
<Stormy> That's what my sister complains about all the time
<Aicebo> 13I go and play the games and stuff on it and collect the items...
<Aicebo> 13lol...
<Stormy> Random people coming up to her asking her with horrid grammar if she's taken.
<Spyrorocks> I think you can only say pre-defined messages, right?
<Aicebo> 13there is a lot of that though too
<Stormy> wtf
<Aicebo> 13on some sections yeah
<Aicebo> 13you can type
<Spyrorocks> "Taken"?
<Aicebo> 13and the reason people speak in chat form is because otherwise messages won't show up.
<Aicebo> 13I have to type in chatspeak on there if I am talking to someone
<Rurik> 4Ohh....someone wants an over the web relationship with your sis
<Stormy> Like, if she has a boyfriend
<Stormy> She's 11 T___T
<Spyrorocks> ...
<Aicebo> 13Yeah, it's stupid
<Stormy> Yeah I know, stupid
<Aicebo> 13I just ignore it normally.
<Aicebo> 13It's also why I make my penguin crossdress
<Aicebo> 13Ololololololol
<Aicebo> 13Everyone else: "EWWWWWW"
<Rurik> 4HAI AICEBO U WNT 2 GO OUT LOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Spyrorocks> I thought you could only say pre-defined things
<Spyrorocks> The club penguin headquarters is like a 3 hour drive from my house.
<Aicebo> 13NO TANK U
<Rurik> 4U SUC
<Aicebo> 13Spyrorocks: HAHAHA
<Aicebo> 13THERE'S A HEADQUARTERS!? XDDDDD
<Aicebo> 13Rurik: I NO RITE
<Stormy> Hah wow
<Spyrorocks> Neoseeker headquarters is a 1 hour drive
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, where they concoct evil plans.
<Stormy> Yeah, on some servers you can only say predefined things.
<Stormy> My sister has gotten into all sorts of e-drama on there already, apparently
<Spyrorocks> Im near all the internet company peoples.
<Aicebo> 13The preset word things are better than the one's on Spyro's Lair at least...
<Spyrorocks> Neo is in Richmond I think
<Spyrorocks> Yeah
<Spyrorocks> spyros lair is useless
<Spyrorocks> you can't do anything
<Spyrorocks> and also
<Spyrorocks> they require you to be over 18
<Stormy> ...
<Spyrorocks> why dont they let the adults say whatever they like?
<Aicebo> 13HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT
<Stormy> seriously?
<Stormy> That's stupid
<Spyrorocks> If I remember correctly it says you need to be 18 or older
<Aicebo> 13Over 18 for a thing for a game that lots of children play?
<Aicebo> 13HAHAHAHAHA
<Stormy> What 18-year-old would want to waste their time on there?
<Aicebo> 13Wow
<Spyrorocks> Yep
<Spyrorocks> No one
<Spyrorocks> I was trying to open up the chat system
<Rurik> 4wtf
<Spyrorocks> but you can't really do it because of how they have it coded.
<Spyrorocks> It doesnt send a message, it sends a message ID
<Spyrorocks> id 1 = whatever what ever
<Spyrorocks> if it receives "1", it displays that.
<Spyrorocks> Meh I dont need to walk around in some dragon fantasy place and talk to people anyways.
<Stormy> The dragons bounce up and down, hahaha
<Spyrorocks> Thats what spyrochat is for.
<Spyrorocks> :P
<Stormy> Over the summer I was really bored so I just made an account to see what the fuss was about
<Spyrorocks> It looks really stupid
<Spyrorocks> they have some decent artwork though
<Spyrorocks> but they should have made it better and more useable.
<Kjakings> 7Hell dari!

<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<RedDragonX> -.-
<Kjakings> 7Well, considering there are written versions of pr0n (someone tried to sell me a bunch once. I was disturbed for several days thereafter), but I'm actually reading a comic
<Kjakings> 7http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/index.php?date=000401&commentary=on This comic, to be exact
<Kjakings> 7The comic ended three years ago nub.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but you said "keeping it busy"
<Kjakings> 7Read it then. It's a random comedy comic with the worst possible ending. In the world.
<Kjakings> 7^Fail
<A_Guy> 12Hello, everyone.
<Kjakings> 7Hell A_Guy
<Kjakings> 7Dari: It's a fail because it is. It's gotta be the worst response in the world. (Note: 90% of the time your responses are "because it is" so you can't claim that as inadequate without having to completely abandon using the line)
<Ember> 6bye people
<A_Guy> 12"Because it is" is a form of begging the question, I believe.
<A_Guy> 12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, with "because I'm awesome" generally. Besides, you insisting that Bob and George is a pr0n comic is just stupid.
<A_Guy> 12God, some people need to get their minds out of the gutter...
<Aicebo> 13Who is AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz.

<Spyrorocks> Late last month, a Saudi judge refused to annul the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 47-year-old man.
<BenevolentFacade> eh..
<Spyrorocks> The judge, Sheikh Habib Abdallah al-Habib, rejected a petition from the girl's mother, whose lawyer said the marriage was arranged by her father to settle a debt with "a close friend." The judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty.
<RedDragonX> think I pissed off some people lol
<Stormy> Why, what did you do? :P
<Spyrorocks> She said the marriages cause girls to "lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."
<RedDragonX> ummm
<RedDragonX> well they were watching it on the tv in the employee lounge
<RedDragonX> I walked by and stopped for like a minute
<RedDragonX> and I think I said someting like welcome to la la land
<Spyrorocks> Hahaha
<Spyrorocks> The best thing to do
<RedDragonX> needless to say I escaped pretty fast
<Spyrorocks> Is to say something
<Spyrorocks> then not argue it.
<RedDragonX> I speak my mind
<RedDragonX> I don't care
<Stormy> Haha, good thing you got away quickly
<RedDragonX> unless I know it's something really bad to say lol
<Stormy> Some of those Obama supporters are pretty nasty
<Spyrorocks> Just keep on saying things and ignoring people when they try to argue them with you.
<RedDragonX> yeah they are
<Spyrorocks> I tried that with my aunt once
<RedDragonX> "He is so wonderful bringing all this change."
<BenevolentFacade> oi
<Spyrorocks> The phyco one
<Stormy> Haha, what change?
<BenevolentFacade> man freakin hate the news for that
<Stormy> he's not even in office yet -__-
<Spyrorocks> I haven;t seen any change yet.
<RedDragonX> not the change we want that's for sure
<RedDragonX> their wont be
<Spyrorocks> Change is over rated.
<RedDragonX> he is already making excuses
<RedDragonX> "It's worse then I feard"
<Stormy> Didn't he create the "office of the president elect" or something?
<Stormy> What a great idea, give yourself more power
<Spyrorocks> Guys don't eat peanut butter
<Spyrorocks> The latest national food safety investigation took on new urgency Friday as federal officials confirmed salmonella contamination at a Georgia facility that ships peanut products to 85 food companies. On Capitol Hill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested records as it opened its own inquiry.
<BenevolentFacade> i think he'll try but i do hope that he does good otherwise we'll be in the shitter
<Stormy> SO you don't have to wait until you're president
<BenevolentFacade> yeah yeah
<RedDragonX> I read something about that
<BenevolentFacade> i know that
<Stormy> *So
<Stormy> Yeah, kind of old
<RedDragonX> yeah
<BenevolentFacade> i pulled a bunch of austin snack crackers off the shelf a while ago
<RedDragonX> and I live in a neigborhood of liberals -.-
<Spyrorocks> "President-elect Barack Obama is preparing to prohibit the use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques by ordering the CIA to follow military rules for questioning prisoners, according to two U.S. officials familiar with drafts of the plans"
<RedDragonX> think we were the only ones in 10 miles to have a McCain poster
<Stormy> Minnesota is one of the most liberal states in the country
<RedDragonX> oh yeah I forgot
<RedDragonX> we can't torture people who have information about kiilling more americans
<BenevolentFacade> lol when i heard of waterboarding i though it was a type of surfing
<RedDragonX> we don't want to be the bad guys anymore
<BenevolentFacade> lol
<RedDragonX> we have to be nice to everyone!!
<RedDragonX> even terrorists
<Stormy> I was surprised that someone in my neighborhood had put up a huge McCain/Palin sign in their front yard during the election season
<RedDragonX> ^ good for them
<Spyrorocks> We put up conservative signs here.
<Stormy> Yeah, let's sit down with the terrorists and talk with them reasonably
<Spyrorocks> We have 4 parties in canada
<Spyrorocks> main ones.
<RedDragonX> oh yeah that will work
<Stormy> Stupid... -_-
<RedDragonX> meanwhile they plot to take out the empire state building next
<Stormy> Haha, yeah
<RedDragonX> but no....we have to be their friends
<Spyrorocks> Conservatives, Liberals, New Democratic Party, and the Bloc Quebecois
<EM99> If you hear a ticking noise, it's just them err, crumbling into reason... :P
<RedDragonX> one big happy family!!
<BenevolentFacade> oi too much news
<Stormy> "Hey, would you mind not bombing Israel?" "Oh sure, we hate them, but since you asked, we'll do it for you, Obama!"
<Stormy> Yeah, that's gonna work
<RedDragonX> you know it -.-
<RedDragonX> welcome to the liberal mind
<RedDragonX> let's be friends
<Stormy> Heh
<RedDragonX> I swear....I wouldn't care if Israel turned Iran into a parking lot
<Spyrorocks> Should north america intervene in a war thats been going on in centuries?
<RedDragonX> well that's the problem
<Spyrorocks> North american countries
<RedDragonX> if we do nothing
<Spyrorocks> that is.
<RedDragonX> they say we don't care
<BenevolentFacade> we got our own problem
<RedDragonX> when we do something
<Stormy> Apparently it could start World War 3
<RedDragonX> they call us murderers
<Stormy> If it gets bad enough
<Spyrorocks> It HAS been bad for thousands of years.
<RedDragonX> the world has been on the verge of WW3 for years
<EM99> I suppose if [Israel is] severely outnumber against a ton of Arab nations, yes.
<EM99> *outnumbered
<Groceries> o.o
<RedDragonX> everyone has their finger on a button
<Stormy> My dad was explaining it to me, but I forgot a few of the details about which countries are allied with which other ones.
<RedDragonX> this world is really really dangerous
<Stormy> But it's a huge mess
<Stormy> Basically
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> put it like this
<Spyrorocks> IF they stop waring, its a sign of the end times.
<RedDragonX> once obama pulls out our forces
<RedDragonX> and nothing is between the Arabs and Israel
<RedDragonX> hmmmm
<RedDragonX> Israel doesn't exactly want another Halocaust
<RedDragonX> and this time they have big bang weapons to back it up
<Stormy> I should think not .__.
<RedDragonX> lots of them
<RedDragonX> they attacked us for crying out loud
<RedDragonX> when we snooped too close
<Snowy> 2...
<Snowy> 2Okkkk
<BenevolentFacade> haha
<RedDragonX> you think they are afraid to attack the arabs? yeah right
<BenevolentFacade> run snowy run
<BenevolentFacade> your next
<Snowy> 12arabs? Huh
<RedDragonX> and they will not just attack them they will annahiliate them
<Snowy> 12Next, for what?
<Stormy> Who's "they," exactly?
<RedDragonX> The Israelis will annahilate the Arabs
<Stormy> (I'd really like to understand all of this so I can know what I'm talking about... :P)
<BenevolentFacade> palistinians i think
<RedDragonX> and anyone who will try to kill them
<RedDragonX> that being everyone around them
<RedDragonX> Syria...Egypt...Iran
<Spyrorocks> Administrators at an Indiana hospital said one of the three numbers listed for the hospital in the latest AT&T phone book connects callers to a phone sex line.
<RedDragonX> all of them are still waging the holy Jihad
<RedDragonX> that began a thousand years ago
<RedDragonX> only this time one false move can create a nucleur war
<Stormy> Sounds like a bunch of nonsense if you ask me
<RedDragonX> "nuclear
<Snowy> 12Heh...

<RaidonMakoto> Hai
<Stormy> I couldn't tell you what's nonsense and what's not in this subject
*Snowy 11growls and bites self.
<Stormy> I'm definitely no expert
<RedDragonX> well
<RaidonMakoto> o_0
<RedDragonX> I only go by what I have seen
<Spyrorocks> brb
<RedDragonX> and what history has taught me
<Snowy> 11ARG
<Stormy> That's why I'm listening to you =P
<RaidonMakoto> kk
<RedDragonX> oh well thank you lol
<RedDragonX> I'm glad someone is willing to listen :D
<Stormy> No problem :L
<RaidonMakoto> I am rocking out to Stewart Copeland at the moment
<RaidonMakoto> You guys?
<Stormy> It's kind of interesting
<RedDragonX> umm
<RedDragonX> rocking to
<RedDragonX> TS0!
<RaidonMakoto> Alright
<RaidonMakoto> I never heard of them :P
<RedDragonX> Trans-Siberian Orchestra
<Stormy> I don't listen to much music
<RaidonMakoto> Ah
<RedDragonX> pretty sweet stuff
<RedDragonX> but anyways...yeah I have some pretty realistic views about it
<RaidonMakoto> Stewart Copeland is the guy that did the first four Spyro soundtracks
<Snowy> 11 /nick hail the ice dragon
<RedDragonX> after all...we learn most by looking to the past
<Stormy> I like music, I just can't be bothered to download songs I like to my MP3 player and listen to them over and over
<RaidonMakoto> He does some awesome st00f
<Snowy> 11o_O
<Snowy> 11 /nick hail the ice dragon
<Snowy> 11>=[
<RedDragonX> and yes Copelands music was awesome
<RaidonMakoto> :3
<RedDragonX> do you know where you want to go to school yet stormy?
<Stormy> Yeah, I'm going to St. Mary's University =]
<RedDragonX> St Mary's eh
<Stormy> In a few months
<Stormy> yep
<RedDragonX> heard of it
<Rurik> 4O_o
<Stormy> It's kind of a small school
<Stormy> Really?
<RedDragonX> my dad had me look at like every school in the country
<RaidonMakoto> Its totally smart to talk about where you're going to school
<RedDragonX> yes I have lol
<RaidonMakoto> ...
<Stormy> hah, I only applied to two colleges
<RedDragonX> I applied to four
<Stormy> I looked at four
<RedDragonX> my younger sister is applying to eight
<Stormy> I got kind of stressed filling out all the applications
<RedDragonX> so did I
<Stormy> So I narrowed down the potential schools list until I had the few that I was interested in
<RedDragonX> know your major yet?
<Stormy> They didn't even make me write an essay :L
<Stormy> Not yet
<RedDragonX> wow no essay?
<RedDragonX> lucky
<Stormy> I'll figure it out as I go along, I suppose
<RedDragonX> that's how most do it
<RedDragonX> I didn't even know mine
<Stormy> What really made the decision for me was the amount of financial aid they offered me
<RedDragonX> well...kinda
<RedDragonX> yeaah that will usually do it lol
<RedDragonX> that's why I went where I did
<Stormy> If all goes well, I might only have to pay $6000 for four years
<Stormy> It's awesome
<RedDragonX> oh wow
<RedDragonX> sweet deal
<RedDragonX> I thought mine was cheap :P
<Stormy> Winona State University just got back to me about my admission
<RaidonMakoto> 6k for four years?
<RaidonMakoto> Holy shit, that's a fucking steal
<Stormy> I'm accepted, but no aid yet =P
<Stormy> But I liked St. Mary's better anyway
<RedDragonX> that is a really good deal
<Spyrorocks> anyone have anything fun to do?
<Spyrorocks> I have been working all day
<Spyrorocks> need some fun time.
<RedDragonX> so have I lol
<RedDragonX> don't feel bad :D
<Stormy> Play Mario Kart with me :P
<Spyrorocks> I would if I could.
<RaidonMakoto> Umm
<RaidonMakoto> I can share the gospel of Stewart Copeland's music with you?
<Stormy> Aww... =P
<Spyrorocks> I said fun.
<RaidonMakoto> Dude, that is fun
<Spyrorocks> Im at home, = dialup.
<Stormy> Just thought I'd ask anyway
<Spyrorocks> Yeah youtube link, dialup.
<Spyrorocks> Cant watch it
<Stormy> You could... help me with this Jawva thing
<RedDragonX> lol
<Spyrorocks> I am going to miss that excuse
<Spyrorocks> when I get broadband
<Stormy> Fun, eh? :P
<Spyrorocks> I could always use the excuse "dialup" to not watch a youtube video.
<RaidonMakoto> XD
<Spyrorocks> But now they are running broadband lines up here
<RaidonMakoto> Nice
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: Lets see what you got
<Spyrorocks> what compiler do you need to use?
<Stormy> Seriously? :P
<Stormy> I didn't think you'd want to... XD
<Spyrorocks> I don't have the Jawva SDK so i cant compile at home
<RaidonMakoto> We can have a socratic discussion on the meaning of life
<Stormy> Doesn't matter
<Stormy> I just need some kind of explanation about what this means
<Stormy> I'll write the code myself
<RedDragonX> hm
<Spyrorocks> ok
<RaidonMakoto> Oh, I know
<Spyrorocks> Your teacher uses terms I don't understand
<Spyrorocks> so yeah
<Stormy> It's the textbook
<Spyrorocks> I know you need to draw a circle
<RaidonMakoto> You can hook my site up :P
<Spyrorocks> Hmmm no.
<RaidonMakoto> XD
<RaidonMakoto> That's fine
<Stormy> Makes everything more complicated than it needs to be
<Spyrorocks> One day ill tell aristeo to do it, RaidonMakoto
<RaidonMakoto> Byethost is a great host
<Spyrorocks> Oh in that case
<Spyrorocks> I wont have to bother atisteo
<Spyrorocks> aristeo
<RaidonMakoto> Alright
<Stormy> http://teachers.edenpr.org/~bridgetj/java1/ch4/Circles.html
<RaidonMakoto> I've been up for a month, have a successful site, and have only used 50mb of bandwidth
<Stormy> There
<Stormy> I'll PM the username and password if you don't remember
<Spyrorocks> I got it
<Stormy> k
<Stormy> :)
<Spyrorocks> Don't ask why I remembered the login
<Stormy> Because it's just that important
<Spyrorocks> RaidonMakoto: One of my sites just used up 30gb of bandwidth yesterday.
<RaidonMakoto> Holy... Fuck
<RaidonMakoto> Which one and how?
<Stormy> T_T
<Stormy> T_____T
<Spyrorocks> Can't say.
<Stormy> T___________T
<Spyrorocks> But it has a lot of downloads
<RaidonMakoto> Oh
<RaidonMakoto> Well, I don't have anything like that on my site
<RaidonMakoto> All my images are hosted on Imageshack
<RaidonMakoto> Any videos are on YouTube
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: Well... It looks pretty straight forward
<Spyrorocks> How much do you have done?
<RaidonMakoto> To minimize the Bandwidth usage XD
<Spyrorocks> aka leech of others
<Spyrorocks> off*
<RaidonMakoto> Yeah
<Stormy> Well... I'm stupid remember? =P
<Stormy> brb

<Spyrorocks> brb
<Stormy> OK, will you cut the swearing please?
<RaidonMakoto> o_0
<Stormy> I'll take a look at it and see if it makes any more sense....

<Snowy> 11stormy are you on mibbit
<Stormy> Yes
<Stormy> Err, no
<Stormy> Whoops
<Spyrorocks> Dont you need to create a graphics object or something?
<Snowy> 11oh.
<Spyrorocks> Or is the graphics object a handle to the applet gui thingie?
<RaidonMakoto> Who's spamming?
<Stormy> I've never done anything with "graphics objects" before
<Rurik> 4Snowy. She kept repeating the same thing over and over
<RaidonMakoto> Oh
<Spyrorocks> do you know how to draw anything to screen?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> What you said....
<Stormy> I'm not really sure why, but it's just not connecting right now....
<Spyrorocks> I mean...
<Spyrorocks> Uhhh
<Spyrorocks> Have you created an applet that can draw something
<Spyrorocks> anything
<Snowy> 11...
<Snowy> 11huh
<Snowy> 11...?
<Stormy> Yes, I've done that before
<Spyrorocks> OK, how did you do that?
<Snowy> 11Too, much tech talk here..
<Stormy> It was a simple one though
<Spyrorocks> Use bits a pieces
<Spyrorocks> what did it draw?
<Snowy> 11o.o Mind boggling.
<Spyrorocks> and did you have a graphics object
<Spyrorocks> of some sort
<RaidonMakoto> brb

<Snowy> 11............................................Haiiillllll D:
<Stormy> Mehh, I'll figure it out eventually I guess
<Stormy> I can't think right now....
<Stormy> :(
<Spyrorocks> seriously though look http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/showtopic18752.htm
<Spyrorocks> I dont do a lot of GUI work
<Spyrorocks> especially not in jawva
<Stormy> It's not really drawing the circle that's the problem though
<Stormy> I could do just that pretty easily
<Spyrorocks> well you should have told me that 20 minutes ago :P
<RaidonMakoto> LMFAO
<Stormy> haha sorry
<Stormy> :(
<Stormy> Forget it....
<Spyrorocks> can you draw a circle to the screen?
<Spyrorocks> just a single circle
<Spyrorocks> no fancy stuff
<Stormy> Yeah
<Spyrorocks> Just a circle.
<Spyrorocks> OK
<Spyrorocks> Now
<Spyrorocks> you need to build a class for that
<Spyrorocks> To make it super complicated.
<Spyrorocks> So you forget what your doing.
<Stormy> Gah, I don't even know how to explain what it is I don't get....
<Spyrorocks> Write a class MyCircle that represents a circle to be drawn.
<Spyrorocks> Lets take it step by step.
<Stormy> Just... forget it... thanks for trying though
<RedDragonX> I'm just gonna go ahead and respond to bmah
<Spyrorocks> I finally understood exactly what you need to do so if I stop now ill fill my head with useless internet things and forget it.
<Spyrorocks> Oops
<Spyrorocks> hit the little red x button
<Spyrorocks> why is it so clickable...
<Stormy> I would ask if that was the toolbar, but you got rid of them all =P

<RaidonMakoto> How big is the drive?
<Spyrorocks> 250gb
<Spyrorocks> laptop
<RaidonMakoto> O_O
<RaidonMakoto> What takes up a quarter of a terabyte?
<Spyrorocks> I bought it like 5 months ago
<Spyrorocks> I download a LOT of stuff
<RaidonMakoto> Ah...
<RaidonMakoto> I getcha ;)
<Spyrorocks> LOTS of random things
<Spyrorocks> and I dont want to delete any of it
<Spyrorocks> so when I fill stuff up I usually go buy a new laptop
<RedDragonX> there...maybe that will shut bmah's mouth
<Stormy> What is bmah doing now?
<RaidonMakoto> Wouldn't it just be more efficient to buy a USB Hard Drive?
<RaidonMakoto> Get a good Terabyte one
<RaidonMakoto> That'll last you two years :P
<Spyrorocks> Probably arguing in the policical stance thread

<Things> >.>
<RedDragonX> I should prolly do that lol
<Spyrorocks> dont bother
<Spyrorocks> it doesnt make sense
<Stormy> I tried reading it... didn't seem to be going anywhere
<Spyrorocks> things: Party time?
<RedDragonX> well let me see if I can or not
<Things> Spyrorocks, mebbeh
<Spyrorocks> It doesnt go anywhere
<RaidonMakoto> Cornys is a crazy dood
<Things> :P
<Spyrorocks> I dont understand what hes talking about
<RaidonMakoto> O'Bama? XD
<Spyrorocks> Things: whats the occasion?
<RedDragonX> If I can't understand it nobody can lol
<Things> Umm, PIZZA!!?

<Stormy> Screw it, I'll work on it later
<RaidonMakoto> Bad spellers, untie!
<Spyrorocks> Im the worst procrastinator ever.
<RaidonMakoto> Procrastinators unite... tomorrow!

<RaidonMakoto> I got a million of these
<Stormy> Java, though, no thanks
<Stormy> :P
<RedDragonX> well some of it makes sense..
<Spyrorocks> hahaha
<RedDragonX> I can see the message he is tyring to get out
<RedDragonX> because yes most of those facts about Bush are true
*Things throws Spyrorocks a box'opizza
<RaidonMakoto> Bush was an idiot
<Stormy> What kind of pizza?
<RaidonMakoto> Plain and simple
*Spyrorocks catches the box'opizza
<Things> Every kind >.>
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: who cares, its free!
<RedDragonX> pretty narrow view..but I'm not gonna say anything
<RaidonMakoto> Someone who has a C Average in Yale and does coke in the National Guard was out president
<RaidonMakoto> Oh, how George Washington is rolling in his grave
<RaidonMakoto> I'm a pretty narrow guy
<RaidonMakoto> XD
<Spyrorocks> Mile long, inch deep.
<RedDragonX> yeah especially since the one running our country now has promised everything to everyone that is in no way gonna be delivered
*Things throws another box to ChanServ
<Stormy> Ohhh, this is not going to end well....
<RaidonMakoto> Obviously
<RaidonMakoto> Not all political promises are going to come true
<RaidonMakoto> The thing with Bush, though
<RaidonMakoto> Is only the promises to Rich people came true
<RedDragonX> and you really think Obama is gonna fulfull his promised to the poor
<Spyrorocks> Well at least im happy :)
<RedDragonX> yeah right
<RaidonMakoto> After he fixes the economy
<BenevolentFacade> no
<RedDragonX> lmao
<RaidonMakoto> Which, granted
<RaidonMakoto> May not happen in eight years
<RaidonMakoto> I know that everything has priorities
<Spyrorocks> *wont happen in 8 years
<RaidonMakoto> And some things just can't be done
<RedDragonX> have you seen the "plans" this man wants to put into action
<RedDragonX> the ones that cose billions of more tax payers dollars
<RaidonMakoto> What
<RaidonMakoto> And the bailouts were good and wholesome?
<RedDragonX> most of which to help those who have no way in bettering themselves?
<Spyrorocks> Things: you there?
<Stormy> Who said they were?
<RaidonMakoto> Obama's economic plan is similar to FDR's New Deal
<Things> Yeah ?
<RaidonMakoto> Make new jobs to fix the economy
<Spyrorocks> Tell marianne that her server is murdering me.
<Things> Hahha whats it doing ?
<RaidonMakoto> Government and Alternative Energy are going to get more jobs
<RedDragonX> make new jobs that nobody can take nor have the experience to do
<Spyrorocks> Killing me
<RedDragonX> the average american is and IDIOT!
<RaidonMakoto> Government jobs, like fixing roads and bridges
<BenevolentFacade> hey now
<RedDragonX> yeah live off the government right
<RaidonMakoto> Creating street signs
<RaidonMakoto> The menial crap
<RedDragonX> they will give you everything
<RedDragonX> mooch of all of them
<RedDragonX> yeah right
<RaidonMakoto> No, not necessarily
<Spyrorocks> Things: It says im using cgi:irc, im using mibbit.
<RedDragonX> I'm not gonna take any government crap
<RaidonMakoto> It both benefits the country
<Spyrorocks> and its murdering me when I connect
<RedDragonX> the liberals can have la la land
<RaidonMakoto> And is a starting point for the economy
<RedDragonX> and it's not goign to benefit the country
<Spyrorocks> I think her server is racist or something.
<RaidonMakoto> It is...?
<RedDragonX> more and more people
<RedDragonX> can't hold a simple job
<Things> Oh
<RedDragonX> they can't
<Things> Thats weird
<RedDragonX> they have no willpower
<RaidonMakoto> So, you're saying
<Things> Cause her own laserchat website usues mibbit :P
<RedDragonX> they suck off the government
<RaidonMakoto> The nation is in economic trouble because we're lazy?
<RaidonMakoto> LMFAO
<RedDragonX> this country has been getting more lazy for the last 40 plus years
<Stormy> No, of course not, it's obviously because Bush is an idiot
<RedDragonX> ever since social securtiy
<RaidonMakoto> +1 Point for Stormy
<RedDragonX> they watned to create a "perfect society"
<RaidonMakoto> Dude
<Stormy> Err, sarcasm =/
<BenevolentFacade> for what reason
<RedDragonX> when they came with the idea of giving everything to everyone
<RedDragonX> because they lived here
<RedDragonX> now everyone expects something
<Stormy> There's no way you can blame the economic mess entirely on Bush
<Spyrorocks> You know what was fun... when the canadian government gave everyone $100 :)
<RedDragonX> and the liberals love to deliver on it
<RedDragonX> but guess who pays for it
<RedDragonX> those people who actually do go to work in the morning
<RaidonMakoto> Subprime Lending, depletion of the treasury, failing wars
<Things> Spyrorocks, that AU government gave evevry kid $1000 in December
<RaidonMakoto> Sounds awesome
<Stormy> Wasn't the cause of the failed economy loans that lazy people couldn't pay back...?
<Spyrorocks> Things: REALLY?
<RaidonMakoto> Sort of
<Things> Yup
<RedDragonX> I'm not putting faith in any plan that is going to have me paying off thousands of my own dollars for nothing
<RaidonMakoto> What happened was the housing bubble exploded
<Spyrorocks> Thats why your economy sucks, your government had to print all that money.
<Things> Well, the money went to the parents, but they got $1000 for each kid
<BenevolentFacade> banks gave out loans to people with no colaterol
<Things> Hahaha
<Stormy> Yeah, that's what I mean
<RaidonMakoto> As banks were giving money to people who couldn't never pay it back for houses
<Stormy> They got lazy
<RaidonMakoto> So, what
<Things> So we got $3000 >.>
<RedDragonX> people are more lazy now then ever...and it's getting worse
<Stormy> And gave out the loans to people who couldn't afford them
<RaidonMakoto> You'll put your faith into bailouts instead?
<BenevolentFacade> they still should of had colaterol
<RedDragonX> the average american can't even find this country on a map
<RaidonMakoto> <RaidonMakoto>: You'll put your faith into bailouts instead?
<BenevolentFacade> dude now that is tupid
<Spyrorocks> Stimulus\.
<Stormy> Better that than government programs that "redistribute the wealth" so it can be fair for everyone
<Spyrorocks> Thats communist.
<RaidonMakoto> But they don't...
<RedDragonX> Seriously...if "George Washington" ever saw what our society has become he would be crying
<RaidonMakoto> We don't do that
<Stormy> That's funny, because I definitely thought I heard Obama say stuff like that
<Stormy> Am I right?
<RaidonMakoto> There is social security for those who cannot work
<Stormy> Or I'm just making stuff up?
<RaidonMakoto> And there is unemployment for a small window
<RedDragonX> at least they had a sense of purpose
<RedDragonX> small?
<RaidonMakoto> I think its like 30 weeks
<RedDragonX> most people don't do shit in this country
<RaidonMakoto> I haven't been unemployed though
<RaidonMakoto> I think you're generalizing
<RaidonMakoto> The reason a lot of people don't have jobs is because of layoffs
<RaidonMakoto> Because people can't buy things
<RedDragonX> no I just don't hide behind the "pitty' wall
<RaidonMakoto> Because people don't have jobs
<RedDragonX> if you want to make something of yourself then do it
<RaidonMakoto> What wall?
<RedDragonX> people have no drive nor will to become better
<RaidonMakoto> I do?
<RedDragonX> christ our freakings schools are getting worse
<RaidonMakoto> And a lot of other people do
<RedDragonX> most poeple can't hold the average job
<RaidonMakoto> Because of this no child left behind crap
<RedDragonX> they are so stupid with common sense
<RaidonMakoto> And again, you're generalizing
<RedDragonX> this just isn't schoo things
<Spyrorocks> Can one of you guys change your text color?
<RedDragonX> I see ite every day
<Spyrorocks> So Its easier to see whos saying what
<RaidonMakoto> 4Better?
<Spyrorocks> Yes
<Spyrorocks> RedDragonX: wana be blue?
<RaidonMakoto> 4Yeah, but you're living in the ghetto
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> Switch it around
<RedDragonX> I don't live in the ghetto
<Stormy> Raidon, you be blue
<RedDragonX> I see many places
<Stormy> RedDragonX, you be red
<RaidonMakoto> 4I'm a libertarian actually
<RedDragonX> thanks to my job
<Stormy> Makes more sense =P
<Spyrorocks> In Canada, blue = conservative, red = liberal
<RedDragonX> and yes stormy that does make sense lol
<Rurik> 4Red is my color D:
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm liberal though, SR :P
<Stormy> But this is American politics :P
<RedDragonX> 4 0.o
<RedDragonX> 4wow I'm not use to this
<Spyrorocks> I know
<Spyrorocks> But I like to say stuff about my country
<Spyrorocks> because its irrelevent.
<RaidonMakoto> 8Libertarians are yellow?
<RaidonMakoto> 8Is this visible?
<RedDragonX> 4hardely
<Stormy> No, change it nao plz
<RaidonMakoto> 2No, I don't think so
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RaidonMakoto> 2Anyways
<Stormy> It's hurting my eyes
<RaidonMakoto> 2Your view is wrong
<Stormy> Ohhhh
<Spyrorocks> Libertarians hurt my eyes.
<RedDragonX> 4and yours is right?
<Stormy> There's a good comeback
<RaidonMakoto> 2All you're seeing is a select view of people
<Stormy> Spyrorocks: XD
<RaidonMakoto> 2That came out wrong
<RedDragonX> 4oh give me a break
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<RedDragonX> 4I swee it eveywhere I go
<RedDragonX> 4you're going to tell me
<RaidonMakoto> 2This is like comparing microeconomics to macroeconomics
<RaidonMakoto> 2You're only looking at a tiny part of the country
<RedDragonX> 4that their are more "intelligent hard working people' in this country
<RaidonMakoto> 2You need to look at the big picture
<RedDragonX> 4what big picture? Dude look at nation surveys
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm not going to say they're evenly distributed
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because people are dumb shits
<Spyrorocks> Its above mexico and below canada, I believe
<RaidonMakoto> 2They need to stop asking the mexicans where America is
<RaidonMakoto> 2And ask people that actually give a crap
<RaidonMakoto> 2Right
<RaidonMakoto> 2So, America is a nation of people with no will?
<RedDragonX> 4so we have a neverending cycle of idiots beeing bred
<RedDragonX> 4yeah pretty much. This country has been going downhill for years as I said
<RaidonMakoto> 2Wow, that's kind of, hopelessly vapid
<RedDragonX> 4we are getting more lazy every yea
<RedDragonX> 4"year'
<Stormy> But it's also true
<RaidonMakoto> 2I don't think so
<RedDragonX> 4well I see the truth
<RedDragonX> 4I don't sugarcoat things
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<RedDragonX> 4I don't see false promises
<RedDragonX> 4no thanks
<RaidonMakoto> 2So you're seeing people who can't hold a job
<RedDragonX> 4I see where things are going
<RedDragonX> 4dude I work for a living
<RaidonMakoto> 2Have you looked elsewhere
<RaidonMakoto> 2Like, where there are jobs?
<RedDragonX> 4idk...lets look...even the simple things
<RedDragonX> 4hs people who work at freaking mcdonalds
<RedDragonX> 4wal mart
<RedDragonX> 4kfc
<RedDragonX> 4and of course they get fired
<RaidonMakoto> 2And, what, they suck?
<RedDragonX> 4because they can't even do that
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yeah, because they decide to take baths in the dish cleaner at KFC
<RedDragonX> 4they don't go to school...nor make any attempt to better themselves
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's because of bad parenting
<RaidonMakoto> 2That kids think
<RedDragonX> 4the bad parenting that is being spread
<Spyrorocks> My friend tylor got fired from Tim Hortans (I dont think you got that in the usa) for stealing doughnuts. Hes a big fat kid so it was funny.
<RaidonMakoto> 2:Oh, I'll go be a gangbanger, I don't need a degree for that."
<RedDragonX> 4hence why we have more and more idiots
<RaidonMakoto> 2No, see
<RedDragonX> 4nobody cares anymore..it's all about ME
<RaidonMakoto> 2The problem is that we don't have a good education system
<RedDragonX> 4give me what I want
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because, again, of no child left behind
<RaidonMakoto> 2And, hey, you know what, people are selfish
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's one of the principles of Economics
<RedDragonX> 4eductation has been going downhill before Bush even came into office
<RaidonMakoto> 2No shit
<RaidonMakoto> 2No Child Left Behind
<RedDragonX> 4selfish the point where they just dont' care about anything
<RedDragonX> 4hence they don't better themselves
<RedDragonX> 4hence the liberals give them everything
<RedDragonX> 4which they take away form workers
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's... the opposite of Selfish
<RedDragonX> 4who actually do something!
<RaidonMakoto> 2And no, the liberals don't give them everything they want
<RedDragonX> 4yeah right..they promise them everything and you know it
<Spyrorocks> If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more?
<RedDragonX> 4pretty much
<RedDragonX> 4I work hard every day
<RaidonMakoto> 2There is social security for those who *Cannot* work and those who can't get a good job, but are trying
<RedDragonX> 4and I"m gonna get charged more!
<Stormy> Because it makes it fair for everyone! Yay!
<RaidonMakoto> 2I don't mind paying taxes
<RedDragonX> 4yeah one big giant pitty fest
<RedDragonX> 4that's just what we need
<RaidonMakoto> 2What
<RedDragonX> 4feel sorry for everyone
<RaidonMakoto> 2And the bailouts aren't a pity fest for those on Wall Street?
<RedDragonX> 4we have to give everyone equal rights
<RedDragonX> 4but don't worry...if you say something you will get sued!
<RaidonMakoto> 2Social Darwinism?
<Spyrorocks> If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more? Because I can "afford" to be?
<RedDragonX> 4liberals and lawyers
<RedDragonX> 4great combination
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yeah, SR, pretty much
<Stormy> That's stupid
<Spyrorocks> Thats dumb
<RaidonMakoto> 2Hey, go to Iran then
<Stormy> People could just sit there and do absolutely nothing
<Spyrorocks> No ill stay in Canada
<RaidonMakoto> 2Its like association fees for living in a Condo
<Spyrorocks> Out of the USA
<RedDragonX> 4the harder working people get more screwed over every yea
<RedDragonX> 4"year"
<Spyrorocks> and Iran
<Stormy> And the people who work hard to earn their money will have to help them
<RaidonMakoto> 2Dude
<RedDragonX> 4to take care of those who need it more
<RedDragonX> 4supposedly
<RedDragonX> 4this war isn't pointless thank you
<RedDragonX> 4join the military like me
<RedDragonX> 4then you will see just where our resolve it
<ninjamast1> it is not pointless
<RedDragonX> 4"is'
<Spyrorocks> If you are disabled or mentally ill, you should receive support. If you are fully capable of working but do not work, then its your own fault. And don't give some BS about not having jobs, there ARE jobs. If you can't finf them, then you are lazy at that too.
<RedDragonX> 4I protect those I love man
<RaidonMakoto> 2So we were in there under false pretenses
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not gonna sit here and watch something else burn
<RedDragonX> 4no thanks
<RaidonMakoto> 2Dude
<RedDragonX> 4the towers were more then enough
<ninjamast1> exact;y
<Spyrorocks> RaidonMakoto: Are you part of the army/navy?
<ninjamast1> *exactly
<Stormy> Spyrorocks: Fully agree with that point
<RedDragonX> 4I have been with those men
<RedDragonX> 4they know what they fight for
<RedDragonX> 4and that's to keep those terrorists away from us
<ninjamast1> If we leave, we will be attacked again
<RedDragonX> 4I sure as hell don't want them here
<RedDragonX> 4thank you for pointing that out Dari
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<Spyrorocks> Is it really just the people who are /not/ actually fighting physically for our country that are complaining about the war?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Iraq or Afghanistan?
<RedDragonX> 4I know things and reasons why we went into Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not allowed to share them
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RaidonMakoto> 2Seriously
<RedDragonX> 4are you in the military?
<RedDragonX> 4join it sometime
<RaidonMakoto> 2No
<RaidonMakoto> 2RDX
<Stormy> Heh, I've noticed
<RaidonMakoto> 2We went to Iraq for WMDs
<RaidonMakoto> 2They had none
<RedDragonX> 4maybe you can learn something
<RaidonMakoto> 2They had no ties to Al-Quadea
<Stormy> Just didn't have anything to say back =P
<RedDragonX> 4oh you don't know the half of it
<RaidonMakoto> 2They were never going to attack us
<RedDragonX> 4believe me
<RaidonMakoto> 2 2% of those we're fighting are Al-Quaeda
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RaidonMakoto> 2The other 98% are people who want us to gtfo
<RedDragonX> 4It's too bad I can't share some of the stuff I know about it
<RaidonMakoto> 2WTF are you, CIA?
<RedDragonX> 4nope
<Stormy> Not that good at multitasking sorry =P
*Spyrorocks flashes money in front of RedDragonX
<Spyrorocks> of course you can
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Stormy> :P
<RedDragonX> 4no I can't
<RaidonMakoto> 2Gee, you think you have a big dick today
<Spyrorocks> RaidonMakoto: Thank you.
<RaidonMakoto> 2There is no reason to be in Iraq
<Stormy> Hey, and you don't?
<RedDragonX> 4believe me MP's have their advantages
<Spyrorocks> hahahaha
<Stormy> You're just as bad, if not worse
<RaidonMakoto> 2If we're at war, the public should know the reason, amirite
<RedDragonX> 4really..why don't you go over their and find out for yourself
<RedDragonX> 4I'm sure they would love to meet you
<RaidonMakoto> 2We were told bullshit reasons
<RedDragonX> 4and you do know that 90% of the media are liberals
<RaidonMakoto> 2What? The 2% Al-Quaeda or the 98% enraged occupants
<RedDragonX> 4oh yeah I forgot about that
<RedDragonX> 4they pretty much twist everyrhint
<RedDragonX> 4"everything"
<Spyrorocks> Fox is the other 10%
<RaidonMakoto> 2And Fox News doesn't?
<RedDragonX> 4yeah they are lol
<RedDragonX> 4yeah all 10% of them!
<Stormy> Oh boo hoo hoo, let's all complain because there's one news channel that's biased the other way
<RaidonMakoto> 2CNN
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RaidonMakoto> 2Larry King
<RaidonMakoto> 2Watch it some time
<Spyrorocks> The media is corrupt any way you look at it.
<Stormy> /Something/ has to at least balance it out
<RedDragonX> 4I do thanks
<RaidonMakoto> 2Pretty unbiased, IMO
<RedDragonX> 4now go watch just about every daytime television broadcast
<Spyrorocks> The media is corrupt any way you look at it.
<Stormy> Yep
<RaidonMakoto> 2See, I don't
<Spyrorocks> One show I can;t stand is The View
<Spyrorocks> Why do people watch that?
<RedDragonX> 4oh wow
<RedDragonX> 4shocker
<RaidonMakoto> 2I get my news from CNN.com, which is pretty unbiased
<RedDragonX> 4and yes I agree just about all media is in some way corrupt
<Spyrorocks> I get my news from the internet, like a normal human being. [/comic book guy]
<RaidonMakoto> 2However, that isn't the point
<RedDragonX> 4that wasn't directed towards your "point"
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's completely divergent to the fact that those we're fighting in Iraq aren't Al-Quaeda
<RaidonMakoto> 2brb - Foodz
<Stormy> Wow
<Spyrorocks> Who are they?
<RedDragonX> 4innocents don't ya know!
<Spyrorocks> Attacks on the usa?
<RedDragonX> 4I'm getting sick of red lol
<Spyrorocks> You need to stay red
<Spyrorocks> it signifies anger.
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> anger against... people.
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not angry though lol
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> I guess
<Stormy> RedDragonX: Is that true about the Al-Quaeda statistic he keeps bringing up?
<Spyrorocks> Umm
<Spyrorocks> pretend you are.
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4and no Stormy
<RedDragonX> 4we have our reasons for going into Iraq believe me
<RedDragonX> 4I wish I could state some of them
<Stormy> 98% of statistics are made up anyways
<Stormy> :P
<Spyrorocks> RedDragonX's internet is being watched by the military.
<Spyrorocks> They will take him away if they find out.
<RedDragonX> 4When you have been through what I have you would know
<Spyrorocks> away... forever.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Back
<RedDragonX> 4I am sworn to top secret levels
<RedDragonX> 4and yeah they prolly would lol
<RedDragonX> 4knowing my luck
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm going to call bullshit on that
<Rurik> 4Well, wouldn't taht suck
<Spyrorocks> To the land of... people who can't keep their mouths shit.
<Spyrorocks> shut*
<RaidonMakoto> 2If you were privvy to classified information
<RedDragonX> 4calling bullshit on what?
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: That was implied.
<Stormy> Prince-Dari: That's the point
<RaidonMakoto> 2You wouldn't be flaunting it on the Internet
<Stormy> :P
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> Your cool when you have secret info.
<RedDragonX> 4again it's something you don't understand
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yeah
<RaidonMakoto> 2Lawl
<RaidonMakoto> 2Try me
<RedDragonX> 4you never will
<RedDragonX> 4unless you join the military
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<RaidonMakoto> 2I know people in the military
<RaidonMakoto> 2And I have never heard this before
<RedDragonX> 4and see some of the shit i have
<RaidonMakoto> 2Oh, boo hoo
<Spyrorocks> ask them for secret docs.
<RaidonMakoto> 2You saw people die
<RaidonMakoto> 2You saw kids play soccer with skulls
<RaidonMakoto> 2No reason to waste billions of dollars in a pointless war
<Stormy> OK, why would he be making it up? Why would he be fighting in the military if there was no reason?
<RedDragonX> 4actually I have not seen someone die thanks
<Stormy> There must be one
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay, fine
<RaidonMakoto> 2Are you deployed atm?
<Stormy> It's just not logical that there isn't
<RedDragonX> 4I have not been into the killzone yet
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<RedDragonX> 4and no I'm not
<RaidonMakoto> 2So they tell you this stuff
<Stormy> Or there would be no one out there
<RedDragonX> 4my only deployment has been to Europe
<RaidonMakoto> 2But you've never been to Iraq?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Bull. Shit.
<RedDragonX> 4Dude I'm part of the Military Police
<RaidonMakoto> 2Classified information is on a need-to-know basis
<Spyrorocks> No, know-to-need basis.
<RaidonMakoto> 2If you were serving in Europe, they would't tell you
<Spyrorocks> In soviet russia.
<RedDragonX> 4this isn't that kind of information that you are refering to. We had our own reaons for going into Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RaidonMakoto> 2For Daddy Bush's good image?
<Stormy> Good image?
<Stormy> what good image?
<RedDragonX> 4you go serve yourself you bastard and you find out
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay, so I sign up for the Military
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then they let me in on the great secret of why we're actually in Iraq
<Spyrorocks> I think the last thing Bush cares about is his image...
<Stormy> If he cared about good image, I don't think he would have gone into the war in the first place since everyone hates him for it so much
<RaidonMakoto> 2And yet, of the millions of people in the Military
<Stormy> Exactly
<RaidonMakoto> 2No one has posted it on the Internet
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not part of a normal division genius
<RaidonMakoto> 2Orly?
<RedDragonX> 4lol you really have no idea what they are capable of do you
<Stormy> T___T
<RaidonMakoto> 2Try me. I said try me.
<Spyrorocks> RedDragonX delivers coke to the forces in Iraq, so shush.
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4no no I"m sad to say not
<RedDragonX> 4is pretty popular in India though
<Spyrorocks> Special division of the military, officer of tasty beverages.
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4would be a sweet job not gonna lie
<Spyrorocks> Literally sweet.
<RedDragonX> 4I joined the military for my own reasons. But to see this country attacked...and see innocent poeple suffer for the radical beliefs of others is more then enough to put aside my own security to do what is right
<RaidonMakoto> 2I got a novel idea
<RaidonMakoto> 2Let's beef up domestic security then
<RaidonMakoto> 2As opposed to going to war with whoever looks at us funny
<RaidonMakoto> 2Prince-Dari: It was
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4well at least another attack such as that has not taken place again
<RaidonMakoto> 2For how long?
<RaidonMakoto> 2If we keep deploying our military all around the world
<RaidonMakoto> 2No one will defend us at home
<RedDragonX> 4well Bush wont be in office will he. Obama wants to bring the soldiers home. Where they were to begin with when the attack happend
<RaidonMakoto> 2What?
<RedDragonX> 4I don't want to see more innocents fall from the towers
<RaidonMakoto> 2That was so gramatically disjointed, I couldn't understand that
<RedDragonX> 4that was just horrifying
<RedDragonX> 4you say that nobody will be here at home to defend us
<RedDragonX> 4our forces were not even deployed when 9/11 occured
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's because of incompetance
<RedDragonX> 4is it now
<RaidonMakoto> 2Bush got a briefing on his desk
<RaidonMakoto> 2A month before it happend
<Spyrorocks> Are you saying they should have been deployed?
<RedDragonX> 4so if it happens now it's because our military is away
<RaidonMakoto> 2"Bin laden determined to strike"
<RaidonMakoto> 2And it even labeled the WTC as a potential target
<RaidonMakoto> 2And Bush ignored it
<RedDragonX> 4and needless to say ever since then nothing has happend to this country
<RedDragonX> 4and nothing will happen thanks that hard earned lesson.
<RaidonMakoto> 2The man really fucked up
<RedDragonX> 4and yes the deaths are nothing to celebrate
<RedDragonX> 4we have had many good men killed
<Spyrorocks> brb
<RedDragonX> 4but they joined and were willing to do what they knew was right for them
<RaidonMakoto> 2More people died in Iraq than WTC
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not going to sit back and watch it happen again
<RaidonMakoto> 2And, I would like to add, they died in Iraq pointlessly
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yes
<RaidonMakoto> 2But invading Iraq does not stop attacks
<RedDragonX> 4I know that...we also have more people die every year in car accidents!
<RaidonMakoto> 2If anything, it promotes them
<RedDragonX> 4is that pointless as well?
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's beside the point
<RedDragonX> 4is it now
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yes
<RedDragonX> 4more poeple die because they are drunk over here
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because Iraq was preventable
<RaidonMakoto> 2Many times, car accidents aren't
<RedDragonX> 4yet guys laying down their lives for defending us is so horrible and worng
<RaidonMakoto> 2Go back to my main point
<RaidonMakoto> 2Invading Iraq does not stop attacks
<RaidonMakoto> 2It only promotes them
<RedDragonX> 4really?
<RedDragonX> 4I have not seen them yet..where are they?
<RedDragonX> 4if they do happen
<RaidonMakoto> 2You noticed how more people wanted to blow themselves up when we invaded Iraq?
<RedDragonX> 4it's not gonna be under Bush's watch
<RedDragonX> 4yeah over there
<RedDragonX> 4not here
<RedDragonX> 4where their are innocents
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because they can't get over here
<RedDragonX> 4the middle east was willing to blow itself up to begin with
<RedDragonX> 4you can't stop what is happening out there
<RaidonMakoto> 2The Middle East has no Navy, no Air Force
<RedDragonX> 4it has been going on for tthousands of years
<RaidonMakoto> 2Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's still killing citizens
<RedDragonX> 4they have no desire to have anything
<RaidonMakoto> 2Of America
<RedDragonX> 4except their religius beliefs
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<RaidonMakoto> 2Now you're stereotyping
<RaidonMakoto> 2Only Islamic Extremists blow themselves up
<RedDragonX> 4Why cause I'm saying the truth?
<RedDragonX> 4extremists want something horrible
<RaidonMakoto> 2Now, people are pushed into Extremism whe we do this shit
<RedDragonX> 4and that's what the ME has come to
<RedDragonX> 4religious wars
<RedDragonX> 4like always
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<RaidonMakoto> 2There were less extremists before we invaded Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4it's been going on since the freaking crusades
<Stormy> How do you know that?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yeah, difference is though
<RedDragonX> 4because he just knows
<RedDragonX> 4don't ya know
<RaidonMakoto> 2They were some crazy nutter faction before we justified their actions
<Stormy> How can you even prove that?
<RaidonMakoto> 2When we, America, become the Big Evil entity
<RaidonMakoto> 2People feel they have to take matters into their own hands
<RaidonMakoto> 2Look it up on the Internet
<RedDragonX> 4We are considered evil when we do somehting
<RaidonMakoto> 2Al-Quaede recruitment shot up when we Invaded
<RedDragonX> 4then not caring when we don't do anything
<Stormy> No one goes around to people's doors and asks, "Oh, hi, are you an extremist?"
<RedDragonX> 4either way they will view us as the bad guy
<RaidonMakoto> 2<RaidonMakoto>: Al-Quaede recruitment shot up when we Invaded
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yes, but less will
<Stormy> Proof?
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not going to watch Osama Bin ladin on freakign tapes wanting to kill our people
<RedDragonX> 4not thanks
<Stormy> =P
<RaidonMakoto> 2Huh?
<RedDragonX> 4he tried it before and failed
<Stormy> But really
<RedDragonX> 4tried it again and was successful
<RaidonMakoto> 2I saw it on TV, so I don't have a link
<RedDragonX> 4and watns to do it more
<RedDragonX> 4Hell no!
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<Stormy> Obviously it would though, because they need more people
<RedDragonX> 4I"m not gonna sit and watch that happen
<RaidonMakoto> 2I have a novel idea
<RaidonMakoto> 2Instead of invading a pointless country, let's focus on capturing Osama
<Stormy> But if they joined, they obviously had the beliefs in the first place
<RaidonMakoto> 2People can be swayed to beliefs
<Stormy> What's important is that the attacks aren't happening
<RaidonMakoto> 2Especially when we look like the big, bad, imposing America
<Stormy> Not likely something that big.... Blowing yourself up is a lot to ask of people
<RaidonMakoto> 2They're running a whole propaganda game in the Middle East
<RaidonMakoto> 2For recruitment
<RedDragonX> 4The extremists were always there. They were there before the invasion...and the attacks would have continued
<RedDragonX> 4what's important is that we keep them over there
<RedDragonX> 4not here
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yes
<RaidonMakoto> 2But there weren't people in Iraq that wanted to blow themselves up to get us out until AFTER we went into Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not gonna let 200 innocent people burn to death because an extremist wants to go out in the name of allah
<RaidonMakoto> 2Which is 98% of what we're fighting there
<RaidonMakoto> 2So, let's kill him
<RaidonMakoto> 2Let's just kill all the Muslims
<RaidonMakoto> 2Even though only a few of them hold the Extremists beliefs
<RedDragonX> 4how do you know
<RaidonMakoto> 2What about the Christians that bomb abortion clinics?
<RedDragonX> 4you knwo just what every Muslim is thinking?
<Stormy> Wtf
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm not going to let people die in Abortion Clinics, so let's kill all Christians
<Stormy> Bombing abortion clinics?
<RaidonMakoto> 2We can't
<RaidonMakoto> 2Which is why we can't justify a Crusade
<RaidonMakoto> 2Its an example, Stormy
<RedDragonX> 4the crusades and holy wars are part of life for arabs. It's how they have been born and raised. YOu really think that's gonna change?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Christian Extremists bomb abortion clinics occassionally
<RedDragonX> 4no matter what the middle east is screwed over
<Stormy> No one does that though....
<Stormy> Or not that I've heard of...
<RaidonMakoto> 2Google it
<RedDragonX> 4once they piss of Israel enough they will do even worse then what we have done
<RaidonMakoto> 2Again, you're stereotyping, RDX
<RedDragonX> 4am I now
<RaidonMakoto> 2Not everyone holds the Jihad view
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not arguing with history
<RaidonMakoto> 2As I recall, the Christians started the Crusades
<RedDragonX> 4no only most of them. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be everone's friend
<RedDragonX> 4who started it is not the issue. They continue it
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's /still/ stereotyping
<Stormy> Kind of is stereotyping though. I know some Muslims and they're definitely not extremists.
<RedDragonX> 4go watch the movie kindgom of heaven sometime
<Stormy> Pretty nice people actually
<RedDragonX> 4oh big bad stereotyping
<RaidonMakoto> 2So, what, when we attack, they're just supposed to lay down their arms and stop fighting
<RedDragonX> 4I've seen enough to know my faith in the matter
<RaidonMakoto> 2...
<RaidonMakoto> 2Oi
<RaidonMakoto> 2But in Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4in the end it wont come to us. Israel will do it sooner or later
<RaidonMakoto> 2They're defend their HOMELAND
<RaidonMakoto> 2Not being tools of their religion
<RaidonMakoto> 2Big difference
<RaidonMakoto> 2Let's suppose that China took control of the US
<RedDragonX> 4you don't know what the Iraqui High command was thinking
<RaidonMakoto> 2Would you be a part of the revolution to get them out?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Its essentially the same thing in Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2People are trying to get the US out of Iraq by any means necessary
<RaidonMakoto> 2People do crazy things when cornered
<RedDragonX> 4I fight for my beliefs just like every average american should do. And I'm not afraid to voice them...that's just the way I am. You don't know what the Iraqui high command or Suddam was thinking. You don't. And we are unwilling to take the chance that their is something even worse waiting for us
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<RaidonMakoto> 2By this Iraqi High Command and Saddam thing
<RaidonMakoto> 2What do you mean by that?
<RedDragonX> 4Do you know what they were thinking. Do you know their plans. Do you know just what they were hiding. Because I garuntee you that you don't.
<RaidonMakoto> 2No
<RaidonMakoto> 2We don't know what China is thinking
<RaidonMakoto> 2Let's attack them
<Stormy> I don't think he's saying he does
<RaidonMakoto> 2I don't know what you're thinking
<Stormy> China didn't attack us =/
<RaidonMakoto> 2Iraq didn't either
<Stormy> There's kind of a difference
<RaidonMakoto> 2Al-Quaeda attacked us
<RaidonMakoto> 2Whom were based in Afghanistan
<RaidonMakoto> 2Iraq had no connection
<Stormy> Yeah, and that's who we're fighting, isn't it?
<RedDragonX> 4and your living in la la land so I think we are just about even. We have gone for the source and we went for other sources that posed a threat to the United States
<RaidonMakoto> 2They're not in Iraq, Stormy
<RaidonMakoto> 2But Iraq didn't pose a threat
<RaidonMakoto> 2They had no WMDs
<RaidonMakoto> 2They weren't making any either
<RedDragonX> 4you don't know that
<RaidonMakoto> 2If we were going to attack a country with WMDs
<RaidonMakoto> 2Why not North Korea or Iran?
<RaidonMakoto> 2I do know that, because UN inspectors found NOTHING
<RedDragonX> 4and I again say that you don't know the half of it
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then tell me the other half of it
<RaidonMakoto> 2You can't debate on "I know something you don't"
<RaidonMakoto> 2Especially when you're talking out of your ass
<RedDragonX> 4and I can't for obvious reasons. But the UN said what they had to say through control of the government
<RaidonMakoto> 2ROTFLMAO
<RaidonMakoto> 2Seriously, ROTFLMAO
<RedDragonX> 4you can accuse me of whatever you want to
<RaidonMakoto> 2You are saying
<RaidonMakoto> 2That America put the UN up to saying that there weren't WMDs?
<RaidonMakoto> 2No one government can put the UN up to do anything
<RedDragonX> 4not American in general you idiot
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then who?
<RedDragonX> 4their are more then just the United States at work here. Far more
<RaidonMakoto> 2One sec
<RaidonMakoto> 2Let me retrieve something
<RedDragonX> 4all I go is from my own personal beliefs and what I have been told
<RedDragonX> 4and unless they have been lying to me
<RedDragonX> 4then I put my faith in what they say
<RedDragonX> 4then I still hold firm to my own beliefs
<RedDragonX> 4just like everyone does
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<RedDragonX> 4this is why I don't like arguing about this
<RaidonMakoto> 2So the other forces in work are... Romania?
<RaidonMakoto> 2You've been lied to then
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because your argument is 100% bullshit
<RedDragonX> 4what the hell are you talking about
<RaidonMakoto> 2<RedDragonX>: their are more then just the United States at work here. Far more
<RedDragonX> 4there is
<RaidonMakoto> 2Romania is, from what it appears to be, the country with the second most deployed forces in Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2Since the UK is bailing
<RedDragonX> 4this isn't just about forces. I have been told stuff about the invasion that is reason enough for me to believe that we went in there for the right reasons
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then tell me
<RedDragonX> 4and wether or not they are lying to us still doens't affect me..I hold firm to what I believe is right
<RaidonMakoto> 2You cannot have a debate with no evidence
<RaidonMakoto> 2All you're saying is "I'm right because I know something you can never comprehend."
<RedDragonX> 4when are you going to understand that I can't freaking tell you anything about it. I have said it ten thousand times
<RedDragonX> 4I am just defending my own views on it
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's why religious debates are bullshit, because religious folks fall back on the "Well, look in the Bible."
<RaidonMakoto> 2So
<RaidonMakoto> 2You are privy to a grand secret
<RedDragonX> 4I learn from history
<RaidonMakoto> 2To why we invaded Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2That many other people know
<RedDragonX> 4and history is doomed to repeat itslef
<RaidonMakoto> 2That has not appeared on the Internet?
<RedDragonX> 4over and over again. It's not going to stop'
<RaidonMakoto> 2Not for six years?
<RaidonMakoto> 2No leaks?
<RedDragonX> 4and it's not going to be America that launches first
<RaidonMakoto> 2Abu-Ghraib gets leaked, but not the real reason we invaded Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2Bull. Shit.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Stop talking out of your ass and learn to debate.
<RedDragonX> 4and you assume to know everything..that doesn't mean it's true because of your own beliefs
<RedDragonX> 4what did you say Dari?
<RaidonMakoto> 2I've backed up all my statements
<RaidonMakoto> 2You rely on "I can't tell you"
<RedDragonX> 4we went after the source of the problem. And that problem stemmed from several different locations. Violence does nobody good yes...but it has been occuring for thousands of years through our own will or not. It's going to happen. But I'm not going to watch our own innocent people die when we could at least make it saffer for our own
<RedDragonX> 4and it's not my fault that I'm in a position where I can't share information. That's just where I have brought myself today
<RaidonMakoto> 2We can make it safer by attacking random people?
<RedDragonX> 4I joined and I'm here
<RaidonMakoto> 2Making enemies is not going to make us safer
<RaidonMakoto> 2Tell me
<RedDragonX> 4the enemy is over there
<RedDragonX> 4not here
<RaidonMakoto> 2Are you deployed in Europe right now?
<RedDragonX> 4actually I'm on leave. I'm in the states until I get my next assignment
<RedDragonX> 4hence why when Obama draws out it gets more dangerous for us
<RaidonMakoto> 2You really think that the Iraqis are going to swim over the Atlantic Ocean
<RaidonMakoto> 2*Pacific
<Stormy> =/
<RaidonMakoto> 2To attack us
<RaidonMakoto> 2After we leave their country?
<RedDragonX> 4we went for the root of the problem and their were Al Quida contacts in Iraq that had to be dealt with. We defended ourselves when neccessary to do so. At least Bush had the freaking drive to actually go do something. Democrats will try to "talk it out'
<RaidonMakoto> 2Al-Quadea had nothing to do with Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4Al-Quida still exists and they operate everywhere within these locations. Drawing out will not help that
<RaidonMakoto> 2Osama PITIED Saddam
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because Saddam let the Jews into his country
<RaidonMakoto> 2Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11
<RaidonMakoto> 2So we go and attack them, real smart
<RaidonMakoto> 2Again, why not Iran?
<RedDragonX> 4Al Quida had contacts that we went for in Iraq
<RaidonMakoto> 2There are more people from Al-Quada in Pakistan
<RedDragonX> 4they were there. And Suddam wasn't exatly Mr. Nice guy either
<RaidonMakoto> 2Why not attack them?
<RaidonMakoto> 2So we should take down every dictator then?
<RaidonMakoto> 2If we're pegging dictators, let's go to war with Cuba
<RedDragonX> 4when they pose a threat it is neccessary to do so. That's where we felt the root of this problem stemmed and we went for it. Suddam was practically insane. Leaving him around for even longer would have done nobody any favours
<RaidonMakoto> 2I would argue that Ahmadinajad is even more insane
<RedDragonX> 4then that's your argument
<RaidonMakoto> 2I would argue that the Ayatollah is more insane
<RedDragonX> 4I can't talk for my superiors
<RaidonMakoto> 2I would also argue that both have WMDs in Iran
<RaidonMakoto> 2Which far outweighs Saddam's imaginary WMDs
<RedDragonX> 4Once we pull out things will only get worse
<RedDragonX> 4and it's going to start with Israel
<RaidonMakoto> 2Israel has the strongest army in the world
<RaidonMakoto> 2They'll be fine on their own
<RedDragonX> 4thats the point
<RedDragonX> 4when the Arabs go for them
<RedDragonX> 4which they wil in a matter of time
<RedDragonX> 4Israel isn't going to let another freaking halocaust happen
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yeah
<RedDragonX> 4pretty close Dari
<Spyrorocks> OK
<Spyrorocks> so im back
<RedDragonX> 4they even attacked us
<RaidonMakoto> 2They have a lot of technology and training
<RedDragonX> 4when we freaking snooped
<Spyrorocks> OK Listen to me for a second
<Spyrorocks> pay attention to me.
<RaidonMakoto> 2kk
<Spyrorocks> I want your focus.
<RedDragonX> 4k
<Spyrorocks> I need to vent for a minute
<RaidonMakoto> 2A'ight
<Icydragon> 12Huh?
<Spyrorocks> OK, so today
<Spyrorocks> I usually don't get mad at people.
<Spyrorocks> Especially my parents, because they usually don't piss me off.
<Spyrorocks> But today, they really ticked me off
<Spyrorocks> First
<Spyrorocks> My mom decides she will search the internet for "young entrepreneurs" to try and find "kids like me"
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> So, she finds this kid's site who makes about 5x the amount I do
<RaidonMakoto> 2My mom did the same
<RedDragonX> 4 0.o
<Spyrorocks> and she says "hey, look at this! This kid is just like you!"
<Spyrorocks> So
<Spyrorocks> She prints out his blong
<Spyrorocks> blog*
<Spyrorocks> and some articles about him.
<Spyrorocks> And shes reading them to me while im on IRC
<Stormy> =/
<Spyrorocks> Now, that really pissed me off
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<Spyrorocks> for one, shes payed more attention to some random kid then she has never paid attention to me
<RaidonMakoto> 2Is she trying to find you friends?
<Stormy> As if you couldn't find people "like you" if you wanted to.
<RedDragonX> 4yeah
<Spyrorocks> and two, shes reading what hes saying and trying to "give me advice"
<RaidonMakoto> 2Lolzifer
<Spyrorocks> That really pissed me off.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Tell her to fuck off
<RaidonMakoto> 2:D
<RedDragonX> 4lmao
<RedDragonX> 4I'm in the mood to second that
<Spyrorocks> "lets go print off some stuff about some random kid, which is more then what I have ever taken an interest in what my son does."
<Stormy> OK, can we go back to the debate now :P
<Spyrorocks> Its like a slap in the face without the physical pain.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Start cutting yourself, they'll pay more attention to you then
<Spyrorocks> No way, im still badmouthing my mom.
<Stormy> I want to watch it for my last two minutes =P
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4oh yeah only an hour for you
<RedDragonX> 4I forgot
<Spyrorocks> fine, return to your debat
<Stormy> Mhhm
<RedDragonX> 4or however long
<Spyrorocks> debate
<RedDragonX> 4I forget
<Spyrorocks> Im finished.
<Stormy> Internet goes down at 10
<Stormy> 9L59
<RedDragonX> 4oi
<RaidonMakoto> 2:/
<Spyrorocks> 1 minute
<RedDragonX> 4that sucks
<RaidonMakoto> 2Right
<Stormy> *9:59
<RaidonMakoto> 2Where were we?
<Spyrorocks> ping timeout
<RedDragonX> 4idk
<RedDragonX> 4where were we anyone know
<RaidonMakoto> 2Israel ending the world
<RedDragonX> 4ah yeah
<RedDragonX> 4how advance they are
<RaidonMakoto> 2Personally, I don't think we need to get involved in other's affairs
<RaidonMakoto> 2If Israel wants to fight ,fine
<RedDragonX> 4we don't
<RedDragonX> 4just proves their resolve
<RedDragonX> 4they don't want others screwing with them
<RaidonMakoto> 2So>
<RaidonMakoto> 2*?
<RaidonMakoto> 2As long as we're not getting shot at, I call that a win
<RedDragonX> 4so they are not afraid to kill anyone who wants to kiill them as well
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm not seeing how this is a problem
<RedDragonX> 4well the only thing now is that they have some not so nice weapons as well
<RedDragonX> 4and if they are threated enough tehy will use them
<RaidonMakoto> 2And yet, we haven't been attacked yet
<RaidonMakoto> 2In this scenario
<RedDragonX> 4no but that would involve the whole world would it not/
<RaidonMakoto> 2No
<RaidonMakoto> 2Israel vs Middle East
<RaidonMakoto> 2Don't see how we would get involved if we remained neutral
<RedDragonX> 4We are Israel's allies
<RedDragonX> 4and that's not changing as far as I can see
<RaidonMakoto> 2We were allies with Britain during the 2nd World War
<RedDragonX> 4if we sit back and do nothing..again they will say we don't care...if we do then we are accused
<RaidonMakoto> 2We didn't join WW2 until Japan attacked us
<RedDragonX> 4this isn't ww2
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm saying
<RaidonMakoto> 2America should have kept the Neutrality Acty
<RedDragonX> 4I see what you are saying
<RedDragonX> 4I don't see that happening
<RedDragonX> 4if one nuke gets launched the world will go nuts
<RaidonMakoto> 2Which is why its great to not get involved
<RedDragonX> 4everyone has their finger on a button
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then no one will nuke us
<RedDragonX> 4in today's world it's only a matter of time before everyone gets involved
<RedDragonX> 4if one launches how long will it bee till the next one does?
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then you try your damndest to not get involved
<RedDragonX> 4that's a risk that is every evident
<Spyrorocks> Bah
<RaidonMakoto> 2Anyways, SR, you were venting?
<Spyrorocks> Im finished
<RaidonMakoto> 2Oh
<RedDragonX> 4you sure lol
<RedDragonX> 4nothing else?
<RaidonMakoto> 2I thought you were waiting Stormy to leave
<RaidonMakoto> 2>_>
<RaidonMakoto> 2Anyways
<RaidonMakoto> 2So, what, attacking Iraq wasn't risking?
<Spyrorocks> actually I was tlaking to her on gmail chat
<RaidonMakoto> 2*risky
<Spyrorocks> but her internet died like 3 seconds in the middle of an important convo
<RedDragonX> 4I"m not refering to Iraq right now
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm comparing things here
<RaidonMakoto> 2How do we know that the terrorists don't have a nuke?
<Spyrorocks> Because no one can prove I sold it to them.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Do you know how many nukes disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed? Its entirely likely
<RedDragonX> 4why would someone be stupid enough to launch one at us. If we really wanted to we could wipe them out in the blink of an eye. But what the hell will that do for the world
<RedDragonX> 4either way we would be screwed
<RedDragonX> 4everyone has access to them now
<RaidonMakoto> 2I thought you said that all the Muslims wanted to die
<RaidonMakoto> 2In Jihad
<RaidonMakoto> 2By your logic, its a win-win for the terrorists to nuke us
<RedDragonX> 4Muslims hold that belief firmly in their palm. My personal opinion states that they are not afraid to die for their god or for their beliefs. That's just how I view it.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Okay
<RaidonMakoto> 2Then they should nuke us
<RaidonMakoto> 2Because then we'd nuke them
<RaidonMakoto> 2They'd die for god and kill us
<RedDragonX> 4well if they want to go for it. But this revolves mostly around the holy land that they once had. Again that's just history for you
<RaidonMakoto> 2That's by your logic
<RedDragonX> 4not all of the are extremists yes
<RedDragonX> 4as you said
<RaidonMakoto> 2As I recall, the Jews had Israel first
<RaidonMakoto> 2Oh, NOW you agree with me
<RedDragonX> 4but the ones that are will go after that no matter what
<RedDragonX> 4The jews were given Israel
<RedDragonX> 4that doesn't meant that the ARabs wont go after it
<RedDragonX> 4they have plenty of times already
<RaidonMakoto> 2Erm, no
<RaidonMakoto> 2The Jews claimed Israel
<RedDragonX> 4eerrrm yes
<RaidonMakoto> 2And had it until Rome took it
<RaidonMakoto> 2Erm, no
<RaidonMakoto> 2The Bible is not a history book, sorry
<Spyrorocks> Lets get our land back by blowing it up.
<RedDragonX> 4It is their homeland. They are in control of it and they are not going to let Arabs, nor Syrians
<RaidonMakoto> 2Thanks for playing though :P
<RedDragonX> 4nor anyone aroudnt hem get into it
<RedDragonX> 4and they have the capability of ending it if they want to that's all I'm saying
<Spyrorocks> The Jews run the world.
<RedDragonX> 4but if one nuke goes off I see nothing but more in the future...that's just how I picture it
<RaidonMakoto> 2And, if we stay far away from it, then we'll be fine
<RedDragonX> 4jews are smart
<RedDragonX> 4 0.o
<Spyrorocks> They run the world.
<RedDragonX> 4you can't stay far away from it today. That's impossible
<RaidonMakoto> 2Far enough away to not get nuked, entirely possible
<RedDragonX> 4no it's not
<RaidonMakoto> 2Ghana doesn't look like its going to get nuked, IMO
<RaidonMakoto> 2Barack Obama isn't Jewish
<RedDragonX> 4^that would be intresting
<Spyrorocks> The jews run the world
<Spyrorocks> They own the Federal Reserve
<RedDragonX> 4You really think that if a chain reaction of nuclear attacks are launched that none of them would end up near American. Nor do they have the capability of doing so?
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: Quite possibly.
<RedDragonX> 4SPYROROCKS IS JEWISH!
<RaidonMakoto> 2They have the capability to do so
<RaidonMakoto> 2However, it wouldn't be a smart thing to do if America wasn't involved
<Spyrorocks> Christian
<RedDragonX> 4yes it would be
<RedDragonX> 4but I just see it happening
<RedDragonX> 4you can't avoid it
<RaidonMakoto> 2Since we could literally destroy a country with our arsenal
<Spyrorocks> America will give you the nukes back.
<RaidonMakoto> 2Yes, you can
<RedDragonX> 4well needless to say that whenever whatever happens
<Spyrorocks> ALLAH
<RedDragonX> 4I hope I'm dead
<RaidonMakoto> 2Well, you're going to Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4I might be
<RaidonMakoto> 2Shouldn't be long
<RedDragonX> 4not certain yet
<RaidonMakoto> 2Hope you have your can of silly-string with you so you don't get hit by ICBMs
<Spyrorocks> I don't think its something you would want to laugh at.
<RedDragonX> 4hopefully not
<RaidonMakoto> 2And watch out for Snipers
<RedDragonX> 4but I will do what I am trained to do
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'll watch the Daily Show when it happens
<RaidonMakoto> 2I'm sure Jon Stewart can make a nuclear holocaust funny
<RedDragonX> 4Good old John Stewart
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: Live with the mole people.
<RedDragonX> 4I like Colbert more
<RaidonMakoto> 2You can't beat Stewart :/
<RaidonMakoto> 2Colbert is really good though
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> The cancelled royal canadian air farce.
<RaidonMakoto> 2I like Bill Maher a lot too
<RedDragonX> 4I like both of them
<RedDragonX> 4both are pretty entertaining
<RedDragonX> 4okay I'm getting sick of this red
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD
<RedDragonX> 4yay for getting up in.....four hours
<Spyrorocks> I can't imagine you without red now.

<RaidonMakoto> 2The snow will clear
<RedDragonX> 4good question
<RaidonMakoto> 2Animals will come back
<RaidonMakoto> 2And earth will return to normal
<RedDragonX> 4and we start all over again yay
<RaidonMakoto> 2We'd be dead
<RaidonMakoto> 2:P
<RedDragonX> 4you never know lol
<RedDragonX> 4it could start over again
<RaidonMakoto> 2After millions of years of evolution
<RedDragonX> 4yu
<RedDragonX> 4"Yup"

<RedDragonX> 4needless to say we don't need another pointless topic to argue about :D
<RaidonMakoto> 2XD

<RaidonMakoto> 2Want to split an island, SR?

<Kjakings> 7 87.5% of all statistics are made up on the spot. If you're one of the 42% of statistics that doesn't, copy and paste this into your sig. In addition, 126.324% of the previous statement does not make sense. Epic win by TJ
<Deathbat> 10...
<Deathbat> 10WIN
<Kjakings> 7Indeed
<Kjakings> 7I saw it when I was typing up my application for RP mod (I have no life)
<Prince-Dari> (We already know this)

<Ryft> 2:D
<Prince-Dari> (Also no one can say that I can't talk, because I got a life for Christmas, but it's still in it's packaging)
<Ryft> 2lucky
<Prince-Dari> It came with free friends.
<Deathbat> 10Why are people scared of the number 13?
<Kjakings> 7I'm not
<Kjakings> 7 13's my lucky numbah
<Ryft> 2me neither
<Kjakings> 7Alongside 666
<Kjakings> 7Dari, get Steve in here quick
<Kjakings> 7... Actually, nvm
<Prince-Dari> Ok.
<Prince-Dari> Ok.
<Kjakings> 7 13*666 = 8658 = the number of ultimate evil?
<Deathbat> 10My sister says my lucky is 742617000027.
<Deathbat> 10........ Hm... you have a point.
<Deathbat> 10paraskavedekatriaphobia = Friday 13th phobia o.O
<Prince-Dari> 647 = more evil than 8658
<Deathbat> 10O RLY
<Prince-Dari> YARLY
<Kjakings> 7 8658 squared = 74960964 = even more evil?
<Deathbat> 10 1115040540.5810810810810810810811 = superly evil number. Nuff said.
<Prince-Dari> I'm bringing Steve on anyway, if you need to use him anytime.

<Prince-Dari> Hey/
<Prince-Dari> Hey.*
<Aicebo> 13hi
<Yahoo> Hiii
<Yahoo> The comic consists of Aleono, Gilden, Darcia, Cassire, Scaraffu, Zakira, Drake, Akira and a few other characters of mine
<Yahoo> each one getting abused by alcohol :P
<Yahoo> Mainly Vodka and scotch at the moment but oh well
<Prince-Dari> How does alcahol abuse you...?
<Yahoo> Aleono can do those things
<Yahoo> Ever made an alcohol bomb before?
<Prince-Dari> Aleono is alcohol...?
<Yahoo> No
<Prince-Dari> Then it's not alcahol abusing them. :P
<Yahoo> Aleono can control alcohol :P
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> What?
<Yahoo> Mikey, you are right, run
<Prince-Dari> How do you 'control' alcohol?
<Yahoo> Omg, you don't know?!
<Yahoo> Pouring it into a glass
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Yahoo> Duh?
<Prince-Dari> ......
<Prince-Dari> That isn't controling it.
<Yahoo> It is in someways
<Prince-Dari> And if you drink pure alcohol, well enough of it, you will die.
<Yahoo> I have to say, the first two comics are of Gilden and Aleono
<Prince-Dari> What do they do, get drunk then wake up the next morning in the same bed?
<Yahoo> Lol no, but that's a good idea
<Yahoo> First page is the classic Pudding Fire with a Bukkit of Vodka
<Prince-Dari> You don't normally put vodka on Christmas pudding.
<Yahoo> Then a scotch bomb on the next
<Yahoo> Ali does :P
<Yahoo> I'll load them up
<Prince-Dari> Vodka is drank in shot glasses because it is strong, if you drenched a whole Christmas pudding in it, enough for it to set alight, that's a lot of vodka.
<Kjakings> 7Dari, let the baby have her bottle
<Prince-Dari> Fine.
<Yahoo> Okay, I might of ment brandy...................shit it did
<Rurik> 4ha

<Kjakings> 7Hulk smash
<Prince-Dari> !isaway jsfogij
<Yahoo> Not only did I loose one of my first best this evening, I had such a shit day, I just want to finish a new chapter of A New Light
<Kjakings> 7Hey Dari, you're a computer nerd, how accurate is IP tracking?
<Prince-Dari> With UK IP's, mine can be accurate even to town.
<Prince-Dari> Although others aren't so accurate, if you find a good one, you can get accurate to state in America.
<Prince-Dari> Sometimes more accurate.
<Prince-Dari> I found a good one which I used on lilgti.
<Prince-Dari> To find out pretty acurrately his area.
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, Ayumi /definitely/ 'transferred' something to Yahoo when they were together. Not only does she have the "whateveritwasearleirbutIforgot" thing, but also the "Sop story to get sympathy so people will stop joking about me wahwahwah" infection.
<Prince-Dari> !isaway lololol
<Kjakings> 7Dari: Ok, stupid n00b threatens to track my IP adress for no apparent reason, how condescending should I be is a better question.
<Prince-Dari> Well IP tracks are mostly complete crap.
<Prince-Dari> Just own him.
<Yahoo> 19:25 Kjakings Yeah, Ayumi /definitely/ 'transferred' something to Yahoo when they were together. Not only does she have the "whateveritwasearleirbutIforgot" thing, but also the "Sop story to get sympathy so people will stop joking about me wahwahwah" infection. Just shut up
<Prince-Dari> Well she didn't deny it.
<Kjakings> 7Indeed
<Yahoo> I don't need your shit today
<Spyrorocks> GeoIP is only accurate to the country, sometimes state if your lucky. Don't hold you breath about anything closer.
<Yahoo> Oh hello sir
<Kjakings> 7No-one ever /needs/ our shit, you get it anyway.
<Spyrorocks> Kjakings: Say "do it".
<Yahoo> Kieran just please stop it
<Kjakings> 7SR: Thanks, I've been meaning to ask this for a few days. You're just never at your keyboard :P.
<Prince-Dari> Spyrorocks: Some are accurate to town with my IP.
<Kjakings> 7I've got the lil' bugger's steam name. Now to go totally own him (this was about a week/5 days ago. I need to own him exceptionally hard).
<Prince-Dari> !isaway lololol
<Prince-Dari> !isaway lololol
<Spyrorocks> Then your just unlucky.
<Prince-Dari> !isaway lololol
<Prince-Dari> !isaway lol
<Spyrorocks> My IP Geos to about 2.5 hours from where I live.
<Spyrorocks> Because thats where the switch box is.

<Kjakings> 7Wouldn't Acynder be 'notCynder'? As in Atheist and Asymmetrical?
<DDR_Maniac> Maybe.

<Prince-Dari> What an idiot.
<Prince-Dari> Lawl, you just see him get dragged off in the end.
<Prince-Dari> Is that the end of the film?
<Prince-Dari> Or do they kill it?
<DragonFireOKN> 2They kill it.
<Prince-Dari> How.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Why can't they have movies where the people actually die....
<Prince-Dari> I know.
<DragonFireOKN> 2They burn a hole in it and stab a poison thingy into it.
<Prince-Dari> Kind of crap.

<Prince-Dari> I read all the books, the ending sucked.
<Kjakings> 7It's a breakable house map for Gmod, but the actual map file was built for L4D.
<Prince-Dari> Not enough people died.
<Prince-Dari> MORE DEATH
<Yahoo> She goes to Stacey and I's (WTH XD) friend, Charlotte. she goes "Heeeeey Charlie, we're in a schooooooool Charlieee!"

<Abbey1053> 14Are you insane or mad?
<EM99> Or both.
<Abbey1053> 14Here take this bounty bar.
<Prince-Dari> So if apple has a valency of two...
<RedDragonX> 4that was a quick test
<EM99> So Abbey, you ressurected yourself?
<Prince-Dari> OA i apple oxide.
<Prince-Dari> is*

<EM99> It's YM, or Your Mom
<Abbey1053> 14Darioxide?
<Prince-Dari> Then I made apple oxide.
<Prince-Dari> Since A has a valency of 2.
<Abbey1053> 14=.=
<Abbey1053> 14Dari.
<Prince-Dari> What?
<EM99> Yes, but if you diluted said apple oxide, couldn't you change the valency (at least in part) to change the afafirs, resulting in a much less dense product?
<EM99> *affairs
<Abbey1053> 14Take the Magnesium and burn it on a bunsen burner and look at it for 10 minutes and see if you can see anything. >=D

<Aicebo> 13And you want everything and refuse to share anything
<Abbey1053> 14yeah

<Deathbat> 10GRRRR
<BenevolentFacade> wtf lag
<Aicebo> 13What
<gerpie> ahoy...
<Kjakings> 7If one day Razz went /way/ too far and we fully teamed up to take her down, and I made my blazing entry to the actual FORUM (in special high definition on channel 275 :P)
<Abbey1053> 14>.<
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Kjakings> 7I was joking with /some/ of that...
<Kjakings> 7But yah.
<Aicebo> 13She is arrogant though
<Deathbat> 10Gerpie: NO. just.... NO
<Deathbat> 10NO AHOY!!!!!!!!!!
<Aicebo> 13She's pissed because she gets "overlooked" and doesn't win contests because she doesn't always color. That's her problem.
<Kjakings> 7Now then, I wonder, if we take down Razz, do all the worshippors become freed from her control, like in Half-Life, or do they become mindless no-life losers, looking for the next thing to worship, much like zombehz.
<Aicebo> 13....

<Kjakings> 7AND NOW, the n00b changes the subject because he has ABSOLUTELY NO response besides his complete n00by ones which he knows will be ignored and have a sarcastic comment made about, by 3 different people before I finish typing the one GOOD one that is more than "Get a room" or "shut up n00b". And so, he changes the subject in the vain hope that we're all FLIES and will forget after 3 seconds if we're not focusing on it. Which Abbey apparen
<Kjakings> 7I bet that got cut off

<Abbey1053> 14joke
<Kjakings> 7And so, he changes the subject in the vain hope that we're all FLIES and will forget after 3 seconds if we're not focusing on it. Which Abbey apparently is while Aicebo waits there silently to comment on my good comment which totally PWNS the n00b even more. As he desperately tries to think up a comeback.
<Deathbat> 10Gerpie: NO! KJAKINGS, HE IS MY (AS YET UNDECIDED) ONION MINION! SHUT UP!
<Abbey1053> 14Well done

<Prince-Dari> Not really, since you he's probably not even here.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: I have plentiful reasons, and Aicebo (*pokes* AICEBO! HELLOOOOO?!) agrees with me.

<Prince-Dari> None of them are good reasons.

<Deathbat> 10Kjakings: ............. OOOOOOO___________OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Abbey1053> 14Take a break.
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Because I don't think it's fair to ask Aicebo to ban him for nothing.
<BenevolentFacade> 2oi
<Abbey1053> 14Take a Kitkat.
<Prince-Dari> Just because another member annoys you, that is no reason to ask a mod to ban them.
<BenevolentFacade> 2what would you do for a klondike bar
<Rurik> 4kill you
<Kjakings> 7... I think Abbey's just some kind of intelligent advertisement bot, designed to stuff as many things to buy in a conversation as possible.
<Aicebo> 13I will ban when I feel it is necessary.
<Abbey1053> 14Dude
<Abbey1053> 14I don't... WTF

<BenevolentFacade> 2heh
<RedDragonX> 4I assume you are about 12 years old lol
<wyndon_torque> 5Sixteen
<BenevolentFacade> 2hmm
<wyndon_torque> 5I don't think men are ick in that way.
<RedDragonX> 4ah
<RedDragonX> 4what's wrong with guys then?
<BenevolentFacade> 2they what icky way d oyou think i am then
<wyndon_torque> 5It's just that from observation I have come to realize that boys are kinda... gross...behavior wise.
<RedDragonX> 4depends on the guy
<BenevolentFacade> 2less restricted then
<RedDragonX> 4some are rather mature and collected
<BenevolentFacade> 2this is the internet ya know
<BenevolentFacade> 2annonymity is the key
<BenevolentFacade> 2which calls attention to my name
<RedDragonX> 4well..I'm not a slob lol...that much I know
<wyndon_torque> 5I know. Just that there's none of the mature type in a highscool in Spring, the armpit of houston!
<RedDragonX> 4well that sucks. Isn't much better up here...most guys are druggies
<BenevolentFacade> 2well its probably just that girls tend to be more mature that boys within their own age group
<wyndon_torque> 5See where I'm comin' from, guys?
<BenevolentFacade> 2didnt i just go over this
<BenevolentFacade> 2indiana
<RedDragonX> 4well I can just say that not all are like that. Their are some very good ones..they are just much harder to find these days
<RedDragonX> 4just my input as a guy lol
<wyndon_torque> 5Oh well.... Can't say I'd much rather want to be in the real world of adulthood which I know for a fact is not much better that this are you're still surrounded by assholes. It's just something that reamains constant throughout one's entire life.
<wyndon_torque> 5as**
<BenevolentFacade> 2back
<BenevolentFacade> 2hmm
<RedDragonX> 4and like I said..as constant as that is...the assholes will always be there...but the friends that you do find will make up for hard times. And you will find someone that fits you eventually...they are just much harder to find..but it's worth it when you do
<BenevolentFacade> 2eh.. most of my friends moved away for college
<RedDragonX> 4well I keep the ones I find close

<ember_da_dragon> 6hi cooleosis
<Cooleosis> hi
<Aicebo> 13Hello :)
<RaidonMakoto> A CHALLENGER APPEARS!
<Aicebo> 13...
<ember_da_dragon> 6hi...
<RaidonMakoto> XD
<RaidonMakoto> Yo
<Cooleosis> have u been playing pokemon?
<RaidonMakoto> Not recently
<Shouri> 12D_D
<ember_da_dragon> 6me yes
<RaidonMakoto> Its a reference to Smash Bros, actually
<Shouri> 12heh
<Cooleosis> same thing
<Cooleosis> sorta
<RaidonMakoto> No...
<RaidonMakoto> One game is about fighting
<RaidonMakoto> And another is about cock-fighting
<RaidonMakoto> MAJOR difference
<Cooleosis> yea
<Cooleosis> still fighting
<RaidonMakoto> In all seriousness
<RaidonMakoto> Pokemon is a RPG
<ember_da_dragon> 6fighting is fun
<Shouri> 12heh
<RaidonMakoto> Smash Brothers is a Beat 'Em Up
<Cooleosis> brawl has an rpg
<RaidonMakoto> Erm, no
<Cooleosis> but u get all the chars
<RaidonMakoto> It has a Story Mode
<Cooleosis> yea subspace
<Prince-Dari> Hey Raidon.
<RaidonMakoto> That's not a RPG
<RaidonMakoto> Its called Story Mode
<RaidonMakoto> Hey Dari
<Cooleosis> its like thirty rpgs in one
<RaidonMakoto> A RPG is like turn-based strategy
<Prince-Dari> You and RedDragonX arguing again? :P
<RaidonMakoto> Huh?
<RaidonMakoto> I argue with everyone
<RaidonMakoto> This shouldn't be a surprise
<RaidonMakoto> Smash is real-time fighting
<Cooleosis> like rite now
<Aicebo> 13:/
<RaidonMakoto> Oh, yeah
<RaidonMakoto> RDX is full of shit
<Cooleosis> that was uncalled for
<Shouri> 12-.-
<RaidonMakoto> No, it wasn't
<RaidonMakoto> The truth is never uncalled for :P
<Cooleosis> it sometimes is
<ember_da_dragon> 6...
<RaidonMakoto> No, see
<Aicebo> 13I am really tempted to kick you.
<Cooleosis> only when the truth isnt the truth
<Shouri> 12do it
<RaidonMakoto> He purports that he is privy to this 'grand secret'
<RaidonMakoto> Of the real reason we invaded Iraq
<Prince-Dari> Personally I don't see how attacking a country that has nothing to do with it stops attacks, it just means that more people are dying in a different place.
<Shouri> 12-.-
<RaidonMakoto> I told him, "No, its not."
<Things> Here we go ...
<RaidonMakoto> And he's like "I can't tell you."
<Prince-Dari> And he never answered me when I asked how that helps.
<Cooleosis> i never said i cant tell you
<RaidonMakoto> I called him out, and he is unable to back up his story
<RaidonMakoto> That is true, Dari
<ember_da_dragon> 6STOP FIGHTING!!
<Things> Aicebo, you can just devoice em too
<RaidonMakoto> We're not fighting...?
<RaidonMakoto> Dari and I agree
<RaidonMakoto> Funny, amirite?

<RaidonMakoto> 10 terabyte in a LAPTOP?
<Cooleosis> no
<RaidonMakoto> Oh

<Things> Prince-Dari, yeah, one of a kind bandwidth sucking blank screen

<RaidonMakoto> That depends on the filetype
<RaidonMakoto> And how its compressed
<Prince-Dari> <Cooleosis> its like 2 mil calculations to the moon and back every millisecond
<Cooleosis> dark knight on my computer is 2 gigs..
<Prince-Dari> How do you know that?
<Cooleosis> i dont
<Cooleosis> its just a guess
<Cooleosis> its a clever metaphor
<Prince-Dari> Assumptions are bad.
<RaidonMakoto> Its probably not an editable video though
<RaidonMakoto> I mean actual video editing
<Prince-Dari> It's not clever if it's almost definitely wrong.
<Cooleosis> what i mean to say is 10tb is a waste of money
<RaidonMakoto> Ripped video and whatnot
<RaidonMakoto> Is huge
<RaidonMakoto> I'd kill for 10 terabytes

<Kjakings> 7Fine then, lemme type it out the PROPER way: It's a fan-trailer made by riptide designed around the events of SA2 to show off its pure epicness. Happy now? If you look.. not closely, hell, if you just LOOK, you can see the change in graphics between the SA2 bits on the sonic next-gen bits.

<Aicebo> 13Who are you talking to?
<Prince-Dari> I don't know Aicebo, guess.

<Stormy> Your response to RaidonMakoto on that political thread was funny, by the way
<Stormy> "You'd KNOW if I'm trolling"
<Stormy> "Yeah, and we know you're trolling"
<Stormy> XD
<Aicebo> 13It wasn't meant to be funny but YAY

<Prince-Dari> I agree with Raidon anyway.
<Stormy> I don't care, he really had no right to say that
<Rurik> 4O_o
<Deathbat> 10o_O
<Stormy> He was clearly just trying to start a fight
<Prince-Dari> I don't agree with that, I'm saying I agree with his point of view on the war.
<Stormy> Yeah, well that's fine
<Stormy> Whatever his political views are are his own business
<Stormy> But when he gets into blatantly trying to start flame wars, no
<Stormy> Anyways.... =P

<Neon> He would've killed me.
<Prince-Dari> Well if the dynamic turning point of an anti-gravitational field, acting upon the stratosphere of an anhydrous solid, which has been exposed to the radiation produced by biochemical nuclear waste was to spontaneously combust, leaving you with an endless supply of carcinagenic energy waves, how would you fix the problem? I cannot see that it is fixable, as the hypothesis that endless waves of energy, which is in a hydronucleic form, can be stopped using any form of enzyme is preposterous, yet if the hadron collider was to be infused with genetically enhanced biobacteria, using exothermic reactions to heat the intersect, you might, just might be able to distort the waves out of proportion, allowing them to split harmlessly into the atmosphere. Although the question would be, how can you genetically enhance the bacteria to allow them to create enough glycerin as is needed?
<Prince-Dari> [quote="RedDragonX"]No Dari you are just crazy lol....[/quote]
<Prince-Dari> Well yes, I am crazy, although, isn't everyone?
<Prince-Dari> I'll leave you with that question.
<Prince-Dari> Hm

<Aicebo> 13Yes
<Deathbat> 10yes.
<Neon> Yes.
<Prince-Dari> Where?
<Aicebo> 13"Can be stopped us"
<Neon> "can be stopped us--"
<Neon> Hey Edina.
<Prince-Dari> stopped using any form of enzyme is preposterous, yet if the hadron collider was to be infused with genetically enhanced biobacteria, using exothermic reactions to heat the intersect, you might, just might be able to distort the waves out of proportion, allowing them to split harmlessly into the atmosphere. Although the question would be, how can you genetically enhance the bacteria to allow them to create enough glycerin as is needed?
<Aicebo> 13HEY!
<Prince-Dari> Still cut off?
<Deathbat> 10MagikalXD AHOY!
<Prince-Dari> Hey MagikalXD.
<Neon> No.
<Neon> Dari it's fine.
<Deathbat> 10Neon: ... your face.
<Prince-Dari> Lol, I posted that on RedDragonX's profile.
<Deathbat> 10What, 'your face'?
<Prince-Dari> I wonder what he'll make of that.
<Prince-Dari> No, the message I just posted.
<Neon> Woah Dari
<Aicebo> 13roar.
<Neon> I actually learned one new word from that.
<Deathbat> 10yeah, I knew that, I was just playing. duh.
<Neon> Anhydrous.... nice.
<Deathbat> 10Hmm, never heard that one before
<Neon> Magikal.
<Aicebo> 13ARE YOU OK!? D:
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Lawl
<MagikalXD> Hello earthlings.
<Icydragon> 12Stupid insects made me look fat.
<MagikalXD> ?
<Aicebo> 13O___O
<Aicebo> 13Ha
<Aicebo> 13*Hai
<Kjakings> 7Hello Martian
<Icydragon> 12 just want some PANTS. A DECENT PAIR OF PANTS!...and maybe your blood, but mostly the PANTS
<Prince-Dari> /notice Icydragon Heheheh, I commented on your profile, a bit late, but whatever.
<Deathbat> 10O.O
<Neon> Ooh, bloood...
<Aicebo> 13...........
<Neon> ^ XD
<Prince-Dari> I think vampires should be magnetic.
<Neon> Because of so much iron?
<Icydragon> 12You owe me for this Aicebo.
<Prince-Dari> I mean, with all that blood in them, which has iron in it.
<Neon> ^ I wiN!
<Prince-Dari> It all adds up.
<Aicebo> 13Icydragon: What?
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Lol.
<Neon> Haha.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: Just like cornflakes. :P
<Prince-Dari> No, crunchy nut.
<Prince-Dari> I can see the leftover iron after eating crunchy nut.
<Neon> Like how Magneto escaped from the plastic prison XD
<Prince-Dari> It's weird.
<MagikalXD> Cornflakes ruined my life at age 6
<Neon> ^ O RLY?
<Icydragon> 12That's nice dear.
<Aicebo> 13O RLY
<Kjakings> 7Actually, vampires generally have less blood than humans at any one time. That's why they need to feed upon human blood so regularly. After a particularly big feeding, with a gi-fucking-normous magnet, maybe.
<Prince-Dari> Hm.
<Stormy> Oi
<Neon> They take in more than they lose, I bet.
<Stormy> =P
<Neon> Because otherwise their body temp. would go far too low.
<Aicebo> 13boredz.....
<Kjakings> 7Oh bugger I forgot Stormy was in here...
<Neon> Theoretically
<Stormy> >_>
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Well that would depend on how big the food source is where they are.
<Neon> ^ Yeah.
<Deathbat> 10But iron isnt a magnet....... it's magnetic. ;)
<Kjakings> 7I think we're reading too much into this
<Neon> ^ We established that way earlier.
<Deathbat> 10or have I got the wrong term? AAHHH
<Prince-Dari> Yahoo.
<Neon> @DB
<Deathbat> 10But whatever.
<Aicebo> 13....
<MagikalXD> Vampires are overused nowadays.
<Aicebo> 13blahhhhhhhrg.
<Aicebo> 13MagikalXD: Yalp.
<Deathbat> 10Especially in twilight
<Neon> Indeed.
<Kjakings> 7Let's have a random question! How did they make the first magnet (yes, I know a magnet is created by aligning the domains into one direction, but to do that you need ANOTHER magnet)?
<Icydragon> 12F*** tha poh-leece!
<Aicebo> 13Twilight sucks now...
<Neon> They found them.
<Neon> They were within naturally-occuring rocks.
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: Because it's over-rated? :P *runs*
<Deathbat> 10INDEEDEH to Aicebo and Icydragon there
<Neon> I learned it last year.
<Kjakings> 7Neon: ... Fair enough
<Neon> There was an actual person credited with the discovery i think.
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: No, because I keep discovering more and more flaws and loops in the story.
<Kjakings> 7^ Like Star Wars?
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Neon> XDDDD
<Kjakings> 7Although Star Wars is epic enough to be forgiven
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: The first magnet on Earth is the Earth.
<Prince-Dari> Lawl.
<Icydragon> 12I FOUND AN ALTERNITIVE TO PAYPAL!
<Kjakings> 7The Earth isn't a magnet, it just has a magnetic field.
<Neon> ^ Truth
<Prince-Dari> Magnetic field pulls in metal.
<Prince-Dari> = Magnetic.
<Neon> There are virtually no magnetic rocks within the earth.
<Prince-Dari> Molten Iron.
<Neon> I mean really within.
<Neon> ^ Is it magnetic?
<Prince-Dari> Lots and lots of molten iron.
<Deathbat> 10We're in a bit of pickle here are we not?
<Neon> If it's molten?
<Kjakings> 7 21:03	Prince-Dari	Magnetic field pulls in metal. 21:03	Prince-Dari	= Magnetic. Magnetic, yes. Magnet, no.
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Damn.
<Deathbat> 10Dari is magnetic?!
<Kjakings> 7Heat destroys magnetism. I say molten iron is hot enough for that to happen.
*Neon feels so nerdy right aboutn now.
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Yeah, the iron spinning round creates the magnetic field.
<Deathbat> 10 21:03 Prince-Dari = Magnetic.
<Deathbat> 10O>O
<Neon> OK.
<Deathbat> 10O.O*
<Neon> I agree.
<Kjakings> 7Heat destroys magnetism. I say molten iron is hot enough for that to happen.
<Deathbat> 10*O.O*
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Yeah, the iron spinning round creates the magnetic field.
<Neon> Read my last thing.
<Prince-Dari> The iron spinning round is what creates the field, Kjakings.
<Prince-Dari> So what happens if the iron stops spinning round...?
<Prince-Dari> Well actually there was a crappy film about that.
<Deathbat> 10Which was...?
<Prince-Dari> And in the end we all die, except in the film they saved us.
<Prince-Dari> Stupid retards.
<Neon> What happens you ask?
<Deathbat> 10?
<Neon> A movie lot of course!
<Prince-Dari> Deathbat: The Core
<Neon> *plot
<Deathbat> 10Hm.
<Deathbat> 10Never heard of it
<Prince-Dari> We watched it in Geography...
<Neon> Hahaha.
<Mage> wat
<Prince-Dari> Basically the iron stopped spinning, everything went crazy.
<Prince-Dari> World was going to end.
<Neon> Prince-Dari And in the end we all die, except in the film they saved us. They?
<Kjakings> 7Oh, in my Geography class last year, the entire class of FUCKING MORONS (I don't care what you say Stormy! They are!) tried to convince me that if the Moon stopped rortating around the Earth and drifted away, the Earth would lose all gravity, because the Moon magically gives the Earth gravity even though it doesn't work like that.
<Prince-Dari> And they started it spinning again by nuking it.
<Prince-Dari> O_o
<Kjakings> 7Nuking iron makes it rotate?
<Neon> XDDDDD
<Deathbat> 10Anyone seen 30 Days of Night?
<Neon> EPIC FAIL MOVIE
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: In films.
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: In films.
<Kjakings> 7I was in the middle of making a point Stormy, geez :P
<Prince-Dari> Well if the moon drifted away we'd probably end up dying.
<Stormy> Should have thought about that before alerting me :P
<Prince-Dari> Since the moon controls the sea partially.
<Kjakings> 7Wouldn't setting off a nuke so far underneath the Earth's surface totally screw it up MORE?
<Prince-Dari> And other stuff.
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: It's a film.
<Prince-Dari> And it was more like 5 nukes.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but we wouldn't lost all gravity if the moon drifted away
<Deathbat> 10apparently the moon moves 3cm away from the earth every year, soon it'll just go PING and zoom away into oblivion. XD
<Neon> I think it'd cause more problems and with a slight chance of correcting the main one.
<Neon> XD
<Prince-Dari> They dropped the nukes, they were placed around the core.
<Kjakings> 7 5 nukes... set off underneath the Earth's surface... saved the earth... Jesus Christ.
<Prince-Dari> And one exploded, then the next exploded, etc.
<Deathbat> 10Anyone seen 30 Days of Night?
<Prince-Dari> Which apparently created movement.
<Neon> How did they gte the nukes that far down without they being incinerated?
<Prince-Dari> They should attach the moon to Earth with a rope.
<Neon> *them
<Neon> ^ HAHA
<Prince-Dari> Neon: They made some freakish ship with some HUGE LAZ0R.
<Kjakings> 7Has no-one seen the Dr. Who episode where they threatened to blow up the Earth with strategically placed NUKES underneath the EARTH'S SURFACE? Now surely, something more like the earth goed boom would happen than it fixing the problem
<Neon> I see.
<Prince-Dari> Although it couldn't go through diamond.
<Prince-Dari> And gradually all of them die.
<Neon> I don't watch Dr. WHo.
<Prince-Dari> Leaving 2 people.
<Neon> Nor do I plan to.
<Neon> Prince-Dari Leaving 2 people. Man and woman?
<Prince-Dari> Yep.
<Neon> Haha.
<Aicebo> 13.....................................
<Aicebo> 13bored.
<Kjakings> 7 21:09	Prince-Dari	Although it couldn't go through diamond. ... diamond cutters > laz0r?
<Neon> WELCOME HOME NEW ADAM AND EVE LULZ
<Icydragon> 12Then do something.
<Prince-Dari> Diamond > All
<Aicebo> 13like what.
<Neon> Diamonds cut diamonds.
<Neon> So...
<Icydragon> 12Umm......
<Kjakings> 7Diamons > nukes?
<Kjakings> 7diamonds*
<Neon> Diamons?
<Neon> :P
<Prince-Dari> Diamonds > Wires connecting nuke to power source.
<Aicebo> 13Umm? I don't know how to "umm".
<Neon> ^ I do.
<MagikalXD> ?
<Neon> ^ !
<Aicebo> 13?
<Aicebo> 13???
<Aicebo> 13??????
<Aicebo> 13???????????????????????????????????????????????????!??????????????????????????????????????????????????
<Neon> You made stairs.
<Neon> Aicebo you made stairs
<Aicebo> 13YEY
<Kjakings> 7Dari: No, that's changing the point. I said "Diamonds > nukes?", not "Diamonds > wires?"
<Aicebo> 13I'M A BIG KID NOW
<Aicebo> 13:D
<Prince-Dari> Diamond > Disarmed nuke.
<Icydragon> 12Dance with bob, he's in this meadow, and he sells microw wave popcorn.
<Neon> WHy did you question anyway?
<Prince-Dari> Diamond can disarm armed nuke.
<Neon> ^ really?
<Aicebo> 13Icydragon: BOB SOUNDS MEAN! *cry*
<Kjakings> 7Again, that's changing the point
<Neon> How do you figure that?
<Aicebo> 13I DON'T WANNA DANCE WITH BOB
<Icydragon> 12Stop crying yo me!
<Icydragon> 12*to
<Aicebo> 13Well WAH
<Aicebo> 13>>
<Icydragon> 12..........
*Aicebo 13flees
<Neon> Dari: How do diamonds disarm nukes?
<Icydragon> 12NO WAIT!
<Prince-Dari> No it isn't, because nuke maybe greater than diamond when armed, but diamond can unarm nuke, then diamond owns nuke.
<Prince-Dari> Neon: I tried it.
<Aicebo> 13What?
<Neon> XD
*Aicebo 13has a hand on the doorknob to the closet
<Kjakings> 7Not "Diamonds > disarmed nukes" but "Diamonds > nukes?", you keep changing the point because you said "Diamonds > all" and now you realise that diamons do NOT > all and you keep trying to change it.... so a magic diamond golem disarms the nuke?
<Neon> Why are diamonds even in question?
<Aicebo> 13...
<Aicebo> 13Well Icy?
<Aicebo> 13What?
<Prince-Dari> Diamonds > Nuke
<Prince-Dari> Nuke cannot blow up diamond.
<Prince-Dari> Nuke blows up self.
<Icydragon> 12Don't run.
<Prince-Dari> Diamond therefore > Nuke
<Aicebo> 13Why?
<Icydragon> 12Or I'll kill a puppy.
<MagikalXD> LEAVE THE PUPPIES ALONE
<Aicebo> 13"AND MY COUSIN JUST LOOOOOVES TO KILL PUPPIES" -Aiden Tour Video
<Kjakings> 7So, you're telling me, if I get a 24 carat diamond, and a nuclear warhead, and explode the nuclear warhead, the diamond will still be there?
<Icydragon> 12NEVER!
*Icydragon 12rips the puppy in half
*Aicebo 13hides in the closet
<Prince-Dari> Carats are for gold...
<Aicebo> 13DON'T HURT ME
<Icydragon> 12I won't!

<spyro_is_1> thanks
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<RedDragonX> what the hell are you talking about
<prince-dari> The question I put on your profile.
<prince-dari> Except maybe Neon.

<prince-dari> He would probably answer it.
<RedDragonX> pssst..doesn't pertain to me or what I do so I could care less lol...
<prince-dari> You could care less?
<prince-dari> Does that mean you care about it?
<RedDragonX> if it was a serious question lol
<RedDragonX> meaning if it was something real in the first place I still wouldn't have answered it most likely
<Rurik> 4kek
<Aicebo> 13LOL http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-7932-if-u-were-a-dragon-what-would-your-name-be-and-which-los-character-would-u-date.html

<spyro_is_1> spyrorocks im just wondering do you happen to know when the movie may be in theaters im just curious one day i heard from my friend on xbox live and i searched for info on it and now im here chatting
<Rurik> 4Mine does to
<RedDragonX> as far as I have heard it's Christmas....or something
<Spyrorocks> spyro_is_1: Most likley it won't be in theaters.
<Spyrorocks> My bet is it will go straight to dvd.
<spyro_is_1> huh
<RedDragonX> yeah...
<Rurik> 4I'm not getting my hopes up for the mobie
<Aicebo> 13Good.
<RedDragonX> It should be right to DVD
<RedDragonX> I don't want to see that rediculed in theaters
<Aicebo> 13I don't like the idea of hearing that you might have to use 3-D glasses
<Spyrorocks> Theres not enough people that would /want/ to see it for it to go into theaters.
<prince-dari> Yeah...Lol.
<RedDragonX> I prolly wouldn't
<Aicebo> 13I would if it will, but it's probably not going to be one of the best movies around...
<RedDragonX> nope
<RedDragonX> just shoot it straight to DVD
<Aicebo> 13...
<spyro_is_1> so it might be on dvd around Christmas thats going to be awhile:(
<Aicebo> 13Why does the phrase "DVD" make me hungry
<Aicebo> 13lol
<RedDragonX> idk when really....the only time I have seen or heard is Christmas
<RedDragonX> and yeah Aicebo I noticed that too 0.o
<Aicebo> 13You too?
<Aicebo> 13XD
<RedDragonX> yeah..
<RedDragonX> and I just ate
<Aicebo> 13Same here
<Aicebo> 13lmfao
<prince-dari> I never feel hungry.
<prince-dari> O_o
<spyro_is_1> hopfully it will come out earlier
<prince-dari> I'm defective.
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari: That's because you are a robot
<RedDragonX> or just inhuman
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Aicebo> 13<prince-dari> Cannot compute.
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOL JK
<prince-dari> If am I am robot, then I'm the cleverest robot ever made.
<RedDragonX> well lucky you
<RedDragonX> personally I think you might have some screws loose lol..
<Aicebo> 13hm
<RedDragonX> might want to get that checked
<prince-dari> Oh God, that pun was painful.
<Spyrorocks> spyro_is_1: I don't think the spyro movie is a priority for the developers right now.
<spyro_is_1> what does that mean
<RedDragonX> curse you aol...
<spyro_is_1> ?
<RedDragonX> it means they are worrying about things that are more important
<spyro_is_1> ok
<Spyrorocks> I just set my brother up a simple PC
<Spyrorocks> I took my old eeepc that has a busted screen and attached an old CRT monitor, usb mouse, and usb keyboard to it
<Spyrorocks> its pretty kick ass
<Spyrorocks> installed Tiny XP rev 5
<RedDragonX> want to come over to my house and do the same
<Aicebo> 13brb

<RedDragonX> sweetness
<Spyrorocks> Im surprised how fast it is
<Spyrorocks> Thats all you need, go buy a busted eeepc off ebay for $70 then buy a new LCD monitor
<Spyrorocks> and there you go.
<RedDragonX> If I was willing to do it I prolly would lol
<Spyrorocks> Theres no actual work that involves knowing anythign about computers really
<RedDragonX> well I just don't want to spend money right now lol...otherwise I would buy a whole new setup
<RedDragonX> that and I'm just busy with other payments
<prince-dari> I need a new motherboard for the old computer.
<prince-dari> It screwed up.

<Spyrorocks> We were dressed and ready to go out for the New Years Eve Party. We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. We phone the local cab company and requested a taxi. The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the back yard, scoots back into the front door. We didn't want the cat shut in the house bec
<Spyrorocks> My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit. Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say Goodbye to my mother.'
<Spyrorocks> A few minutes later, I get into the cab. 'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away. 'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come
<Spyrorocks> out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard!'
<Spyrorocks> The cab driver hit a parked car.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Aicebo: Got it now/
<prince-dari> ?*
<Aicebo> 13Yes.

<Aicebo> 13God I feel terrible laughing at this guy but I can't help it
*Catabatus 10has no clue what everyone is talking about
<Aicebo> 13Catabatus: Read Swaffy's posts in "Annoying Girl"
<prince-dari> Watch
<prince-dari> her peers carefully, and don't let them hurt your sister's soul.
<prince-dari> LOL WTH
<Aicebo> 13He called me a "_____"
<Aicebo> 13I mean WTF is that
<RedDragonX> 4oi
<RedDragonX> 4bitch I think
<Aicebo> 13XD
<Aicebo> 13"I have sinned. Please forgive me, my heart has been attacked by demons. "
*Catabatus 10knows what everyone is talking about
<RedDragonX> 4or some swear word that he is already going to hell for because he was thinking it in his mind :D
<prince-dari> I could swear you only pray to God, not Jesus...
<RedDragonX> 4oi...
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari is smarter and he isn't even a Christian
<Aicebo> 13LOL
<Catabatus> 10x)
<Mage> wat
<Catabatus> 10Gah, Swaffy annoys me
<Mage> i need to like
<Mage> hang out on the forums more or something
<Mage> <-- fails
<Catabatus> 10xD
<RedDragonX> 4alright...
<Aicebo> 13Mage: There is a member on SpyroForum who is overly-religious, and I have confronted him and given him a warning about him trying to constantly convert members into Christianity
<prince-dari> Well I'm going to write a speech for Geography now, back later.
<RedDragonX> 4there I gave him a comforing post of some sorts
<Catabatus> 10Well said, RedDragonX
<Mage> aicebo, im an atheist , but I know that for pretty much ANY religion theres no such thing as overly religious
<Mage> thats like their positive thing
<Mage> you cant blame people for believing in what they want to :S
<Aicebo> 13Well, he seems to turn anything (even if it is nothing near religious) into something about God or Jesus.
<Mage> like I said, thats kind of their thing
<Catabatus> 10Oh, perfect timing. There are people talking about God on TV.
*Catabatus 10changes channel
<Mage> my friend does it all the time too
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<RedDragonX> 4well after that nice little ramble of his I don't think he will be on for awhile
<Mage> just try to be more open-minded than everyone else, I've found it helps
<RedDragonX> 4now that he thinks "demons" have attacked his heart 0.o
<Mage> which is kind of weird since were talking about christianity..its usually the flip side o.O;
*Catabatus 10snickers
<Mage> DEMANS
<Aicebo> 13Mage: I've dealt with him long enough. When he joined in the summer, he'd told me that I was going to hell. I've tried to ignore many of his posts about his religion, but I'm at the end of my rope now. I am an open-minded person, but I've had enough of him harassing me and other members with his posts.
<Ryft> 2"Demons over there, KILL THEY ASS!"
<Ryft> 2heh
<prince-dari> LOL
<Mage> well eh.. PM him about it?
<Mage> most situations dont have to be resolved on public forums xD
<RedDragonX> 4they shouldn't be....and that's prolly what it has come to now
<Catabatus> 10Man... how can a "demon" attack your heart anyways?
<Catabatus> 10And your heart pumps blood throughout your body, it doesn't control your emotions/what youd o
<Aicebo> 13It's the "magic of the bible"
<Aicebo> 13=P
<Catabatus> 10*you do
<RedDragonX> 4it's his beliefs
<RedDragonX> 4nothing we can do to change them
<Catabatus> 10xDDDDD
<Mage> i guess the same way a giant man loves us all yet still likes to watch us suffer
<Catabatus> 10xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
<prince-dari> LOL ^
<Mage> even if he did exist, I wouldnt follow that guy, hes kind of twisted
<Aicebo> 13And like how a giant man loves us all yet wants more than half of the population to "burn in hell"
<Catabatus> 10Besides, a "demon" would have to be able to (somehow) slip into the bloodstream
<Aicebo> 13Yes, of course, he loves EVERYONE
<Catabatus> 10Bahahahaha
<Mage> ITS CALLED HEPATITUS
<prince-dari> Catabatus: I WILL INJECT DEMONZ INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM!
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Mage> :(
<Catabatus> 10noooo!
<Aicebo> 13And, the reason that I brought it into the topic instead of PM, is because I confronted him in PM once before, yet he refused to listen to me. I want him to know that I am serious.
*Catabatus 10nods
<Catabatus> 10O_O Maybe they hide in our food
<Aicebo> 13Catabatus: LOL
<Catabatus> 10Or NEEDLES
<Catabatus> 10Flu shots don't give you the flu. They inject demons into your VEINS.
<Mage> I kind of like how swaffy cuts himself off
<Catabatus> 10xD
<Aicebo> 13Yeah
<Aicebo> 13Ahaha
<Mage> its almost like he realises how insane he sounds
<Catabatus> 10"God really will help"
<Aicebo> 13hah..
<Catabatus> 10Then why doesn't he do something about Global Warming?
<Aicebo> 13I feel terrible laughing at him, but I just can't help it.
<Catabatus> 10Why are there wars?
<prince-dari> <Mage> i guess the same way a giant man loves us all yet still likes to watch us suffer
<prince-dari> Oh and there are arugments for this kind of thing ^
<Mage> yeah I know
<Mage> Ive seen a lot of them
<Mage> brb for a little
<prince-dari> The one for that is that if we are given freedom to do as we want, there will always be murderers, people who steal, etc.
<Catabatus> 10" If you don't want to believe in the bleepin truth, then keep your crap to yourself" "Back off and give people some freedom to share the real truth"
<Catabatus> 10*snort*
<Aicebo> 13That's what really pissed me off.
<Catabatus> 10Same, and it wasn't even directed at me
<prince-dari> I tend just to ignore overly religous people, rather than argue with them.
<RedDragonX> 4no point in arguing
<RedDragonX> 4you are not going to change anything
<RedDragonX> 4when we all die then you will no
<prince-dari> I know they have their beliefs, I have mine, I can't say anything to change their beliefs.
<RedDragonX> 4"know"
<RedDragonX> 4not before
<RedDragonX> 4all you can do is live how you see fit
<Aicebo> 13I wasn't attempting to change his beliefs.
<RedDragonX> 4I know you were not
<Aicebo> 13I've just had enough of him bringing it into everything and harassing the others
<prince-dari> Yes, but they will see it as that. :/
<RedDragonX> 4that's just how I view religious arguements and such as a whole
<prince-dari> So I just ignore them.
<Aicebo> 13He needs to know when to stop.
<RedDragonX> 4we will not know until we die
<Catabatus> 10Every other post of his includes "God" or "Jesus"
<Aicebo> 13^indeed
<RedDragonX> 4eh...maybe he is trying to cleanse himself with holy water right now...
<Aicebo> 13...lol
<Catabatus> 10I don't even get how you can make water "holy"
<Aicebo> 13It's just water I'm guesing.
<Aicebo> 13WIth salt in it or something
<Aicebo> 13*guessing, With
<Catabatus> 10Bahaha
<Aicebo> 13Because apparently it burns
<Aicebo> 13SO
<Aicebo> 13Water with salt?
<Aicebo> 13In your eyes?
<Aicebo> 13Idk?
<Catabatus> 10Oh, I saw this one person's fan character (dragon), and it's element was "salt water"
<Ryft> 2ouch
<Ryft> 2heh
<Catabatus> 10xDDD
<RedDragonX> 4it's water
<RedDragonX> 4that they put in a church
<RedDragonX> 4and it's considered "holy"
<Ryft> 2hehe'
<prince-dari> It's probably considered holy because a priest/bishop has blessed it.
<prince-dari> By saying some prayer or other.
<RedDragonX> 4it's just like marketing....it's presented that way as to cater to the beliefs...nothing more
*Catabatus 10sighs
<Ryft> 2heh
<prince-dari> It doesn't really count as marketing, as no one sells "Holy water".
<Ryft> 2eh
<prince-dari> Does holy water even exist...?
<Catabatus> 10Isn't it supposed to burn demons or something like that?
<Ryft> 2"It's like smoking a cactus.."
<RedDragonX> 4but what do I know...again it's all personal views..nothing we can do about it
<RedDragonX> 4hey Aicebo you did see what he wrote in the talk about anything thread right
<Aicebo> 13http://www.spyroforum.com/post-252593.html#252593 My post to let Swaffy know that I am not here to flame him

<Aicebo> 13XD
<Catabatus> 10If he feels so horrible why doesn't he just apologize?
<prince-dari> LOL ^
<Catabatus> 10Instead of asking someone to pray for him...
<prince-dari> Good point.
<prince-dari> Very good point.
<Aicebo> 13"Well what do you know...a girl solved a math problem! You know what that means...A WITCH!!!"
<prince-dari> Ego?
<RedDragonX> 4cause he is bathing in holy water
<RedDragonX> 4trying to cleanse his soul
<prince-dari> I worked out what holy water is.
<Mage> If I recall youre supposed to ask GOD for forgiveness, and keep to yourself about it
*Catabatus 10prepares herself for a very corny joke
<Mage> at least thats what they taught me
<prince-dari> They get a bishop to pee in water, which makes it holy.

<Mage> :X
<Mage> SORRY IM JUST ON THE INTERNET
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Aicebo> 13It's more fun to guess
<prince-dari> When I found out that Nestl had been selling powder milk to mothers in poor countries, which are already too poor to afford it, quite frankly, I was shocked and disgusted. I thought that this company would be better than this, yet it is endangering lives for money. There are some of the reasons as to why you should stop.
<prince-dari> With formula milk you need to mix it with water, and many of the countries in which the powder milk is sold do not have clean water, which can lead to children getting diseases, especially as infants are very vulnerable, and will end up with many unnecessary deaths.
<prince-dari> Another reason is that as many of the mothers buying the formula milk are so poor, they use even less of the formula as is needed, to make it last longer, resulting in some children not receiving enough nutrients, because its too weak.
<prince-dari> Also, the formula milk doesnt contain many of the natural benefits that breast milk does, such as some nutrients and antibodies, which provide somewhat of a protection for many illnesses, such as, diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infections, and respiratory infection. Breast milk also contains the right amount of nutrients for development of the brain and nerves.
<prince-dari> I think that's enough.
<Catabatus> 10*gasp* http://www.enterthehaggis.com/
<prince-dari> Not much, but she said only about half a page.
<Catabatus> 10..... D:
*Catabatus 10shrinks away from the giant wall of text
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Catabatus> 10.......
<Aicebo> 13..........
*Catabatus 10explodes
<prince-dari> I hope that Nestl will reconsider their decision to sell formula milk to mothers in poor countries.
<prince-dari> Ending sentence.
<prince-dari> Woo.
<prince-dari> Although they stopped years ago.
<Aicebo> 13Walk slowly for a moment, you don't have to tell me why August lasts forever and maybe we could leave the lies if only for a moment you don't have to tell me why August lasts forever!
<prince-dari> Heheheh.

<Aicebo> 13And itching herself.
<Aicebo> 13Baha
<Catabatus> 10She's itching herself?
<Catabatus> 10So she's making the itch worse?
<prince-dari> Once I said "I need to itch myself", my mum corrected me.
<Catabatus> 10Ahh, I get it
<Aicebo> 13...
<prince-dari> She's the reason I'm the grammar nazi I am today.

<prince-dari> Mcdonalds is total crap.
<prince-dari> Subway is the best.
<prince-dari> KFC and Burger King come second.
<prince-dari> Mcdonalds is off the scale, in t he bad direction.
<Neon> McDonald's is indeed crap.
<Yahoo> KFC is my fav
<Neon> Although it has a lot of help because it was one of the first.
<prince-dari> Neon: Xbox 360 is crap.
<Neon> ^ LIES
<prince-dari> Common hardware errors, expensive games which are crap, disks are often damaged while being played, Xbox live (No need to explain this), it makes loads of noise, overheats, expensive, games freeze often, sometimes doesn't even detect the games.
<prince-dari> The list goes on.
<Yahoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQL0vIdq3nY LOL
<Yahoo> Includes Jack Black
<Neon> Not for the Arcade, which I have. I disagree. Only when the console is tipped over. Xbox Live is amazing, actually, although it should be free. and for those last four they were corrected within the first 2 running years. It's the cheapest of the three currwnt generation consoles.
<Neon> *current
<prince-dari> Neon: It damages games sometimes, regardless of what you do, and very often if it is standing up.
<Neon> Never heard of that happening.
<prince-dari> And Xbox live is crap.
<Neon> ^ Explain.
<prince-dari> Slow speeds, their servers are crap, they make you pay for extra things too.
<Yahoo> OMG SAFFIE!

<Aicebo> 13lolololol
<prince-dari> I never have lag with wii online games.
<Neon> Play locally if your connection is that slow.
<prince-dari> Never seen anyone lag.
<Neon> XD
<prince-dari> It isn't your connection.
<Neon> Well mine is fine.
<Neon> I've never had anything be slow on Live.
<prince-dari> As I said, depends on how far you are from the people you are playing.
<prince-dari> And it is nothing to do with your connection.
<Neon> O RLY?
<prince-dari> It's server side.

<Neon> Seeya.
<Raine> yeah there was no way i was getting the Snuffleupagus one ^^
<Neon> So, Aicebo, you don't believe in possession?
<Aicebo> 13Obviously not.
<Aicebo> 13Demons are fake.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Neon> OK, so even if demons are fake as you say, what about spirits, like dead people.
<Neon> ?
<Aicebo> 13They don't exist either.
<Neon> ALright, so here and now is all there is?
<Aicebo> 13And if they did, there are no such thing as "evil" spirits
<Neon> ^ Is there evil in people?
<Aicebo> 13Evil is nothing but a state of mind.
<Neon> OK, so even if it is, if there are evil people there must be evil in a spirit, as a state of mind.
<Kjakings> 7Evil is nothing but opinion. What one considers to be evil, the 'evil' person considers to be right and wholeful.
<Neon> ^ I agree.
<Aicebo> 13Whatever Neon, all that demon malarkey is just to scare little children IMO.
<Neon> I'm not even talking baout that anymore.
<Neon> Bear with me I wanna pick your brain.
<Neon> *about
<Neon> OK, so even if it is, if there are evil people there must be evil in a spirit, as a state of mind.
<Neon> AGreed?
<Aicebo> 13Nope.
<Neon> But you're defying your own logic then.
<Aicebo> 13Nope.
<Neon> Then explain.
<Aicebo> 13I don't do the whole "spirit" shit, so no, and there are no evil people.
<Aicebo> 13Why do you care about my views?
<Neon> Alright.
<Neon> I care because it matters.
<Neon> Hmm.
<Aicebo> 13:/
<Aicebo> 13Whatever
<Neon> OK.
<Yahoo> LOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Yahoo> I just got ina right fuss over nothing
<Neon> LOl.
<Kjakings> 7So, same as normal?
<Neon> Also, for the record, I don't believe in spirits. But yes, I know demons are real. [/end]
<Yahoo> I was screaming and cursing that I had lost one of my favourites songs and ripped my bag looking for my USB stick and it was still on iTunes
<Neon> ^ XD
<Yahoo> I screamed when I found it
<Yahoo> Now I need to find a new bag
<Neon> Why would you care that much about a song anyway?
<Neon> :P
<Aicebo> 13I do
<Neon> NO, I mean, even if you lost one song it would be quite easy to get back.
<Neon> *No
<Kjakings> 7Neon: Yes, but Aicebo and Yahoo are screaming fangirls, remember?
<Aicebo> 13Why buy a song again when you bought it before?
<Aicebo> 13That's one less new song to get
<Yahoo> I don't buy songs :P
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: ...>=(
<Neon> I don't think a dollar is worth screaing about is all I'm saying.
<Neon> *screaming
<Yahoo> It's off a CD
<Neon> ^ Your point?
<Yahoo> 17:45 Aicebo Why buy a song again when you bought it before?
<Yahoo> ^My point being that
<Neon> Your point is flimsy then.
<Neon> Because screaming and ripping open your bag for one song that you could get back with little effort isn't worth freaking out about.
<Neon> IMO.
<Aicebo> 13Ripping songs off of CDs on iTunes DOES take forever though...I gotta new one I need to rip..
<Yahoo> I have to rip nearly 20 Disks
<Yahoo> My dad bought a stack of 50
<Yahoo> JUST FOR A QUID!
<Aicebo> 13Yahoo: I've ripped tons more than that
<Yahoo> Yeah, how much :P
<Yahoo> How new :P
<Aicebo> 13hm?
*Neon laughs because now they are arguing about who has ripped more songs from disks.
<Yahoo> Hoooooow
<Aicebo> 13HOOOOOW!
<Yahoo> .....I still have more Os
<Aicebo> 13Neon: No, I'm not aruging, she's just complaining about ripping 20
<Neon> Well, regardless, you're arguing now.
<Neon> XD
<Yahoo> I'm not complaining, I just can't be bothered
<Neon> O RLY?
<Yahoo> Yes, really Neon.
<Yahoo> COLDPLAY FTW
<Aicebo> 13...
<Aicebo> 13Coldplay sucks now.
<Neon> I love how, also, because I won, you change the subject entirely from the one song to 20 disks that need to be ripped or whatever.
<Yahoo> ...
<Aicebo> 13Neon: No, I did not. I don't want to be harassed by your beliefs right now, thank you.
<Neon> Beliefs?
<Neon> XDDDDD
<Neon> ALso I was talking to Yahoo.
<Aicebo> 13Beliefs of spirits and demons and all of that other bullshit.
<Neon> That was from 10 minutes ago...
<Yahoo> (light up, light up, as if you have a choice.............................louder louder, as we run for our lives.........)
<Yahoo> Sorry
<Neon> I was talking to Yahoo, saying how she changed the subject about th freaking out over one song to the disk ripping subject.
<Yahoo> That is one of my fav songs
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOL My piano cover got rated 1 star
<Aicebo> 13...

<Aicebo> 13That reminds me of a scene from Nick and Norah
<Kjakings> 7Bax
<Aicebo> 13Where Norah's drunk friend drops her cellphone into a public restroom tiolet with puke in it and she has to grab in and reach it out and she was in the middle of a convo when she dropped it

<Deathbat> 10No, I meant included. ^_^
<prince-dari> That does not make grammatical sense.
<prince-dari> Also, do any of your understand this?
<prince-dari> Let's just agree that although the probability of anyone having not done something which is almost undeniably the most heinous act of crime that could be committed by anyone of that caliber, such as the ambiguous job of cleaning the sewers, which are then flooded with nuclear waste, morphing your cells, and completely changing your genetic code, is a most unlikely act compared to the cookie theft of which I suspect you all of committing. Therefore you shall all be sentenced to death by German dictionary, very very thick German dictionary. Enjoy your time on death row, also your last meal will consist of cookies, namingly of the doughy, chocolaty sort, yet laced with hidden ingredients such as arson, and others, ensuring you a slow and painful death.
<prince-dari> Did that get cut off?
<Aicebo> 13"Therfore y"
<Kjakings> 7Yes
<Aicebo> 13So yes.
<prince-dari> Therefore you shall all be sentenced to death by German dictionary, very very thick German dictionary. Enjoy your time on death row, also your last meal will consist of cookies, namingly of the doughy, chocolaty sort, yet laced with hidden ingredients such as arson, and others, ensuring you a slow and painful death.
<Deathbat> 10yes.
<Deathbat> 10"Therefore y"
<Kjakings> 7Also, you lost me around "Let's".
<prince-dari> How can I lose you on the first word?
<Kjakings> 7Skillz in a sausage roll (mai skillz)
<prince-dari> That's not skillz.
<prince-dari> That's phail.
<Deathbat> 10I'm confundled.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: I was being sarcastic
<prince-dari> I can never tell with you.
<Deathbat> 10sausage roll?
<Deathbat> 10ooh.
<Kjakings> 7Dari, need you to do me a favour (not a hax favour)
<Deathbat> 10"You couldn't stalk me, I'm a ninja. You'd think you were stalking me and all of a sudden I'd tap you on the shoulder and f*ck you."
<prince-dari> Kjakings: Which is?
<Kjakings> 7Tommorow remind me to go on Yarolds
<prince-dari> Ok, if you tell me Yarolds is.
<Aicebo> 13Oh my God.
<Kjakings> 7It's a click exchange. Click links = get credits = get clicks for the link/s you posted.
<prince-dari> Oh right.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Kjakings> 7I've been lazy the past few days and forgetting to go on it = my dragonadopters thing doesn't grow up
<prince-dari> Also I meant arsenic, not arson.

<prince-dari> That's a forged wedding certificate.

<prince-dari> I'm not your average vicar.
<prince-dari> Priest*
<Rurik> 4Wait, what?
<Kjakings> 7Rurik: I want a divorce, since I never agreed to marry you in the first place.
<prince-dari> You know a divorce costs a lot of money, and as I'm not your average priest, it costs about 200% extra.
<Kjakings> 7... Why would we pay you for a divorce? Surely a divorce is for the legal system?
<prince-dari> I do that too.

<Kjakings> 7Oh yeah, my form got to /pick/ the music for the school disco next week or whenever. I don't intend to go, since school discos are boring and gay, so I put 10 of the WORST songs on there I could think of. I only know one Linkin Logs song though so I had to think a bit on the last three or four
<gerpie> 3booring

<Aicebo> 13:P
<Kjakings> 7'Specially me
<gerpie> kja
<gerpie> even if i leave
<gerpie> u would miss me ;p
<Kjakings> 7And C7, hell, I'm trying to make her harbour hate towards you (I've never encountered someone too nice to harbour hatred. Turning her to the Dark Side will be my greatest work so far). And no, I would NOT miss you. Why the hell do you think I've been trying to GET RID OF you?
<gerpie> hmm?
<Kjakings> 7That's it ignorant goldfish. You ignore it
<gerpie> ok?...
<Kjakings> 7I HATE doing that
<gerpie> yea...
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: We need a goldfish, there is no one else to replace the goldfish.
<Prince-Dari> You can't get rid of the goldfish. :P
<Prince-Dari> It's like that cat in the hat.
<Prince-Dari> The goldfish is annoying as hell, but you NEED the goldfish.
<Kjakings> 7The goldfish replaced malefor, who partially replaced then breeded with hail. There will always be n00bs dari. I don't want any here.
<gerpie> did i replace malefor?..
<Kjakings> 7Yes. I prefer malefor.
<Prince-Dari> Seriously?
<Prince-Dari> I prefer Gerple.
<Prince-Dari> Malefor's religiousness is too annoying.
<Aicebo> 13Yalp.
<gerpie> dari on the SF with RP games
<gerpie> he always play spyro
<Prince-Dari> He makes Spyro religious.
<gerpie> but he always overdo it and that not fun
<Prince-Dari> Religious Spyro, creepy.
<Aicebo> 13Malefor throws wooden cross at Spyro. "CONVERT SPYRO, CONVERT!"
<gerpie> anyways
<gerpie> i bet malefor hadt better gramamr then i do
<gerpie> grammar*
<Kjakings> 7Yes. I was beginning to beat all his n00byness out of him until some traitor drove him away.
<Kjakings> 7Probably the same traitor who's been feeding information to Ayumi. *Glares*
<gerpie> who is that traitor? ;\
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Yahoo?
<Prince-Dari> Gerple: He didn't have better grammar when he first came here. :/
<Kjakings> 7No. I forced him to improve.
<Kjakings> 7He was intelligent enough to know he couldn't beat me
<gerpie> lol
<gerpie> anyways my english on school isnt bad -.-
<gerpie> i'm the best of my class but yea i only have nubcake,s in mah class
<gerpie> they prever deutch
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Well Gerple's spelling/grammar is better than when he first joined.
<gerpie> well i still don't know when to use than ;\
<Prince-Dari> When to use what? "Than"?
<gerpie> but yea i really almost g2g cuz my mom is getting mad
<gerpie> brb ganna get my kitten
<gerpie> bck
<gerpie> i ate to musch candy my tonqeu is black XP
<Kjakings> 7 20:25	Prince-Dari	Kjakings: Well Gerple's spelling/grammar is better than when he first joined. Not as good as Malefors is now, and less of an improvement on it than Malefors.
<Prince-Dari> Well Malefor is actually English, so Gerple's improvement is still better than Malefor's.
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Who's better, Gerple or Malefor?
<Aicebo> 13hey Neon
<Kjakings> 7Actually, factoring in that, they're about equal
<Neon> Malefor.
<Prince-Dari> I suppose.
<Prince-Dari> Neon: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat...?
<Neon> Kalefor is much more fun.
<Neon> *Failfor.
<Kjakings> 7But this is a purely statisitcal point of view. Malefor is more fun to poke, less of a drama queen, and with more understandable messages
<Prince-Dari> Malefor is more annoying.
<Neon> ^ Exactly.
<Prince-Dari> With his egotistical religious crap.
<Neon> If we really wanted to, we could mold Failfor into a very effective vicegrip.
<gerpie> hey ryft

<prince-dari> I like donuts.

<prince-dari> /notice Neon DFOKN asked me if Kjakings was male or female, and I told him that Kjakings was female, to which he responded "Ah, I thought so, he has many feminine qualities", or something like that. Don't tell Kjakings yet though, I want to see DFOKN call him female or something, then watch the resulting argument.
<Neon> OK.
<Kjakings> 7Ok, lemme try something
<Neon> You do that.
<Neon> XDDDD Dari
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<Neon> Hey.
<prince-dari> I should have asked DFOKN what those "qualities" were.
<Neon> Yeah lol
<prince-dari> Hello Rurik.
<Rurik> 4hi Princess
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> This is just like when DFOKN always used to try and annoy me, even though I did nothing to him.
<prince-dari> Although he failed.
<Neon> It's funny how Kjakings has never posted once on SF.
<prince-dari> And you fail too.
<Rurik> 4No, he hasn't
<Rurik> 4How'd he even get here?
<Neon> He joined and came stright to Chat guess.
<Neon> *I guess
<prince-dari> You don't have to have an account on SF to get here, Ruri.
<Neon> Kjakings Ok, lemme try something *5 minutes later*
<Rurik> 4What I meant was that how did he find this site
<Rurik> 4Oh, speak of the devil
<Rurik> 4literally
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7My reputation preceeds me
<prince-dari> Not really.
<prince-dari> It's only Ruri.
<Kjakings> 7Oh well
<Kjakings> 7I don't really give a fuck
<Kjakings> 7
<Kjakings> 7Stupid keybord
<Kjakings> 7Stupid keyboard *
<prince-dari> And it is possible that he found the server, and then found the channel, Ruri. Although I doubt it. Kek.
<Neon> HE SED TEH KEK
<Neon> Oh... oh no --not again. Graaaaaahhh...
<gerpie> meh
<gerpie> hellow?
<prince-dari> Hello.
<gerpie> meh
<Yahoo> I CANT HELP BUT LAUGH AT THAT PREP
<prince-dari> ...
<Yahoo> Right, here's the jizz
<Aicebo> 13..........................
<Aicebo> 13That's just terrible, Yahoo.
<Rurik> 4Yahoo wants it, that's why she signed up
<Aicebo> 13o________________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
<Rurik> 4RIGHT KJA!?
<Kjakings> 7Huh?
<Rurik> 4Look at what Yahoo said
<Yahoo> Poor poor lottie had an accident on the chair in French and she ran off to "Get Changed" in the bathroom, Abbey, Maisey and I were sitting down finishing our work -___- and Atlanta (A fucking prep who is a right girly shit) asked for a rubber. Maisey was mucking around next to that very chair and dropped the rubber in the blood. She didn't know that atlanta needed the rubber so she just put it on the table. Abbey gave Atlanta t
<Yahoo> Did that get cut off?
<prince-dari> http://www.spyroforum.com/gem.gif
<Kjakings> 7Yes it did
<prince-dari> Abbey gave Atlanta t
<Yahoo> Abbey gave Atlanta the rubber and both didn't know what it was covered in. Atlanta used it and she ate soon after without washing her hands XD
<Rurik> 4Define rubber
<Yahoo> A small round object made of rubber to erase pencil marks
<Rurik> 4Ah
<Yahoo> I was loling my head off because I knew EXACTLY what was going on XD
<Kjakings> 7Who the fuck names their daughter after a city?
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Yahoo> The retards that had that preepy little shit
<Yahoo> *preppy
<Yahoo> And I have proof that her mum is a slut
<Yahoo> But I don't have the picture with me
<Kjakings> 7Oh, you got a picture of you and her together?
<Rurik> 4AHA
<Yahoo> No
<Yahoo> The little shite took a picture of her mum to school today
<Rurik> 4I think Gerple finally realized no one wnats to talk to him
<Aicebo> 13lol
<prince-dari> If anyone drives away the goldfish, we will need a new goldfish, so whoever drives him away becomes the new goldfish.
<Aicebo> 13nu uh
<Aicebo> 13:P
<prince-dari> Yep. :P
<Rurik> 4kek
<gerpie> meh?
<prince-dari> ...
<Kjakings> 7Dari: I do not agree with your earlier statement and am therefore not bound by it.
<prince-dari> I don't care if you agree or not, the goldfish must be replaced.
<prince-dari> And I shall treat you as the goldfish, should it be your fault the current goldfish leaves.
<Kjakings> 7Hah. If you wish the goldfish to be replaced, then you can become the goldfish. I had my little pet n00b that SOMEONE drove away, so now I'm driving away yours. A new n00b will come along anyway, they always do.
<prince-dari> No, you shall be the goldfish, as the one who drives the goldfish away shall replace the goldfish.
<prince-dari> It is not that I wish for the goldfish to be replaced, it is that it must be replaced.
<Kjakings> 7Ok then, you completely ignore what I've said like a good little goldfish
<prince-dari> A good goldfish would listen to what you have said, idiot.
<Kjakings> 7Not by goldfish standards though. A normal goldfish would completely ignore what you say in an argument and then try and claim you're the stupid one because IT doesn't understand what you just said.
<Neon> Gerple would just forgoet every 3 seconds.
<Neon> *forget
<prince-dari> That does not make it a good goldfish.
<prince-dari> There is no such thing as a good goldfish.
<Kjakings> 7See? Like you're doing now!
<Neon> We're combating between goldfish morals/
<Aicebo> 13Hey Neon
<gerpie> meh
<Neon> Hey/
<Kjakings> 7Hell Neon
<prince-dari> Kjakings: No, I'm not ignoring what you are saying, I'm proving that it does not work.
<prince-dari> You are disregarding what I'm saying.
<prince-dari> My orange-texted goldfish.
<prince-dari> Your text suits your position.
<Neon> 3So I must be envious, eh>
<Neon> 3?
<gerpie> éhh?
<Neon> 3No accents on letters!
<Kjakings> 7Dari, no matter what you say I will not become the new goldfish, and my text was orange long before gerple started to realise that the internet WASN'T just for child porn!
<Neon> 3:P
<gerpie> sorry neon ^^
<Neon> 3Lawl it's OK n00b.
<prince-dari> You will become the new goldfish should you drive away the old one.

<Neon> Killing Enigmatic Kings.
<Kjakings> 7We've made some changes since your last visit. You see, the flaming torture pits /with/ a bottom were moved to the /east/ wing, and the bottomless pits of flaming torture were moved to the /south_west/ wing. People kept getting them confused.
<Neon> LOL
<Neon> They moved bottomless pits? XD
<Kjakings> 7Yes
<Neon> Teehee.

<Kjakings> 7Yeah... why?
<Neon> Just seemed established.
<Neon> Dunno.
<Kjakings> 7Well, I was expanding upon my "Welcome to hell" thing, since you actually /came_back/ and it was getting kinda stale.

<Neon> No hom.
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: I'm trading 300 units of white aura and 200 of dragonscale so I can get 500 units of blue aura, for an item background. I'll have like no money left, but all Night really needs currently is clicks and food. And if that bastard runs out of 25 units of food in three days I'm putting him on a diet and sueing the maker of that stupid less hungry ring
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Aicebo> 13I need moar clicks

<Aicebo> 13And no, you told me to bookmark the dragcave site, not that one.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7Oh well
<Kjakings> 7Haha. People on the resource exchange are so stupid. No-one's gonig to give you 350 of blue aura for 300 of white aura A) because it's a shit deal B) I have 300 for 300 right below you C) YOU'RE A RETARD
<Aicebo> 13hm

<Deathbat> 10Kjakings: You're not very harsh are you, eh?
<Deathbat> 10*sarcasm*
<Kjakings> 7Nope!
<gerpie> grr
<Deathbat> 10http://a.deviantart.com/avatars/c/a/caekplz.png
<Deathbat> 10WOO!
<Kjakings> 7CAEK <3
<prince-dari> Cake does not exist.
<prince-dari> I will not explain again.
<prince-dari> I've already explained twice.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but caek does
<prince-dari> caek = 1337 version of cake, 1337 version = n00b version
<Neon> What's the significance of 1337?
<prince-dari> 1337 in 1337 = leet
<Kjakings> 7Caek and even it's more powerful form cæk are paralell versions of cake, and therefore are not 1337/n00b, and THEREFORE EXIST! SO SUCKIT
<Neon> Ah.
<Neon> I forget they use 1 as leet.
<Neon> *l
<prince-dari> parallel versions of cake only exist in parallel worlds.
<gerpie> yeayea?
<Neon> Yup, and if cake was ever real, you'd die.
<Deathbat> 10Cake does exist
<Neon> By real I mean atruth.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: And this is a 'parallel' world. This world is as parallel to all other parallel worlds as they are parallel to us.
<Neon> ^ Heresy!
<Deathbat> 10But I didnt have any because I don't like it.
<Deathbat> 10THE END.
<Deathbat> 10Thank you.
<Neon> But what about your berfday caek?
<Kjakings> 7prince-dari: And this is a 'parallel' world. This world is as parallel to all other parallel worlds as they are parallel to us.
<prince-dari> It only exists in a parallel world to this world, meaning a parallel of this world, this may be a parallel of other worlds.
<prince-dari> But in this world we have cake.
<Kjakings> 7SO THE CAKE DOES EXIST!
<Kjakings> 7HAH
<prince-dari> Yes, but it is made of light.
<prince-dari> So is virtually a lie.
<Kjakings> 7Jesus, 4 minutes >=/
<prince-dari> As I have explained.
<prince-dari> Let me explain again.
<gerpie> wtf is kja doing?
<Neon> :P
<prince-dari> Should you take an atom of cake, and use nuclear fision on it, to find out exactly what it contains, you find nothing more than trapped light, although what traps the light is an extremely thin layer of a substance called xenophen, this is what keeps the light in the 'atoms', and gives them structure, otherwise the light would simply escape, therefore cake has no taste, or smell. As this element is odorless and tasteless.
<prince-dari> And is a lie.
<gerpie> ;\
<Neon> *raises ahnd*
<Neon> *hand
<gerpie> OMG
<gerpie> in a anime they just sayd
<prince-dari> Yes Neon?
<gerpie> show them your stuff yowie WTF
<Neon> I have a question.
<Neon> Now if the light is beign refracted into the appiarition of true cake, what would eb the purpose?
<Neon> *being
<Neon> *apparition
<Kjakings> 7IT DOEN!
<prince-dari> Well there is no true cake.
<Neon> Or is there?
<prince-dari> Only caek, which exists only in parallel universes.
<gerpie> *eats cake*
<prince-dari> And thus I cannot say to you what the results would be.
<prince-dari> /j #dm
<prince-dari> /j #trivia
<Neon> non u
<gerpie> dari would u like a piece of cake?
<prince-dari> I cannot have a piece of what does not exist.
<prince-dari> Bored.
<gerpie> i wanna play poker X]
<prince-dari> My poker skillz > yours
<gerpie> you think so?
<prince-dari> I know so.

<prince-dari> Ahhh!!!
<prince-dari> Neon went off with Kjakings before I got back. O_o
<Aicebo> 13lol
<prince-dari> Hey Neon.
<prince-dari> Brawling with Kjakings?
<Aicebo> 13hi
<Neon> Iw ould be.
<Neon> He won't guve me his code.
<prince-dari> Lol, why?
<Neon> His reply was "Meh"/
<prince-dari> I could get it out of him.
<Neon> Ok.
<prince-dari> "You're a n00b, I bet I'd beat you at brawl."
<prince-dari> He would respond to that.
<Neon> Yeah.
<Neon> Alright.
<Neon> Hi Aicebo.
<prince-dari> I beat him at MKW.
<Neon> MKW?
<prince-dari> I thrashed him.
<prince-dari> Mario Kart Wii.
<Neon> Mortal Kombat?
<Neon> Oh OK.
<Neon> Kewl.
<prince-dari> Never played him at brawl though.
<Neon> Do you have Brawl?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<prince-dari> And GHWT
<Neon> I'll give you mah code.
<Neon> Kewl.
<prince-dari> And GH3.
<prince-dari> And lots of other games
<prince-dari> .
<Neon> Sw33t.
<prince-dari> You have any Guitar hero games?
<Neon> I recently started using the Wiimote for Brawl, since the GC controller is much easier.
<Neon> Nop.e
<prince-dari> I never had a gamecube, so I don't have gamecube controllers.
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> I bet the Classic Controlelrs would work well too.
<Aicebo> 13I love gamecube
<Aicebo> 13and nintendo64
<Aicebo> 13but Wii = no
<prince-dari> ...
<Neon> 3995-6281-4851
<prince-dari> Wii > Gamecube + N64
<Neon> ^ Yup[
<prince-dari> It has sold more than both of them put together I think.
<prince-dari> And I have an N64 emulator on my Wii :P
<Neon> ^ Haha.
<prince-dari> Thanks to TP hack.
<prince-dari> Neon: One sec, I'll get mine.
<Neon> :P
<Neon> OK.
<Aicebo> 13Probably because fitness freaks/soccer moms want their kids to play the stupid sports games
<Neon> The sport games suck.
<Neon> I only like the bowling and Tennis.
<Neon> And even then I sold the frickin' game for like 3 dollars, becaus seriously it's like worth nothing. (Wii Sports)
<Aicebo> 13I doubt that "Wii Fit" even does anything. "Ooh, look at me, I'm staning on a square thinking that I'm exercising, YAAAAAY"
<Neon> My dad has it, and it's decently fun, but I doubt it's good for exercise...
<Neon> :P
<Aicebo> 13What about Wii Clean the House
<Aicebo> 13Wii Vaccuming

<Yahoo> SpyroChat IRC Chatroom | Welcome to the largest spyro fan chat room on the internet! | http://www.spyroforum.com / http://www.spyrochat.com / http://www.spyroworld.net | Prince-Dari eats cats.
<Yahoo> Lol
<Neon> Good game again
<Neon> Curses.
<Neon> I suck with Toon Link anyway.
<Neon> Haha.
<Neon> Lucky.
<A_Guy> 12Hello, prince-dari.
<Yahoo> Hey daaaaaaaaaariiiiiiiiiiii
<Yahoo> PRINCE-DARI
<Yahoo> I need your chat thingy
<Yahoo> I have sound effects for my microphone and they only come up in proper webcam use
<Neon> I'm done.
<Neon> Prince-Dari, I'm done for now.
<prince-dari> Pah, use the best brawl character. :P
<Neon> Kirby sucks.
<Neon> That's why I won 5 out of 7.
<prince-dari> So?
<Neon> Because of your character chouice.
<Neon> (choice
<prince-dari> You used meta knight for most of the games.
<prince-dari> And he is well known as the best character.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Apparently he's banned from contests.
<Neon> I used a variety, but then realized I'd have to actually trym using one of my favorites.
<prince-dari> Because he's too good.
<Neon> *try
<Neon> I usually use Link or Sonic.
<prince-dari> I always use Kirby, lol.
<Neon> Haha why?
<prince-dari> He's fun to use.
<Neon> It seems like all you do is use the move where he turns heavy.
<Neon> :P
<Neon> Oh well that was pretty fun.
<Neon> Next time I won't use Meta Knight.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Neon> If Lucario wasn't so low gravity he'd be awesome.
<prince-dari> I don't like Lucario, most people just spam his energy ball attack (I know you didn't)
<Neon> I think it's inconvenient to use his shadow ball much.
<Neon> It leaves you so open to be slammed.
<Neon> Ddi you beat the Adventure Mode?
<Neon> Yahoo.
<prince-dari> I've only managed the hardest version of the thing with the master hand with 5 lives,.
<prince-dari> lives. :/*
<Neon> I think i did the hardest setting on three lives because I wanted whatever reward you get for that.
<Neon> Some trophy I think.
<Neon> Wait, ahev you play Melee?

<Neon> Please reinstall file "Abbey1053 secret" immediately.
*Neon powers down.
*Cynder7 6reinstalls

*Neon crashes
<gerpie> rolf
<Cynder7> 6GAWD
*prince-dari inserts another skillet CD.
<gerpie> owned by virus?
*Neon is fixed.
*Neon rejects, because it is not the album "Comatose."
<gerpie> omg why would he want comatose?
<prince-dari> If an error which is caused by no error appearing, how is it an error, and if so an error appearing because there are no errors would mean that there is an error, therefore contradicting the reason for the error. So according to this logic you will now implode, because of an error, which is not an error, caused by an error.
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Neon> I'm sorry, your complaint is invalid.
<prince-dari> No it isn't/
<Neon> The only way for an error to occur is to be any other error other than a 1337 error, in which no identifiable error has occured.
<Neon> 1337 Errors represent unknown causes for the error.
<Kjakings> 7Aah yes, but your technobabble stabilizers were never built to handle such a high level of bullshit. The resulting implosion will destroy yours and all adjacent states of the USA

<SpyroMad156> 3who
<Kjakings> 7Hey Yahoo, you know any fonts that will fit Shadow-on-a-flaming-rampage?
<SpyroMad156> 3?i do ... DA FREAK!
<SpyroMad156> 3http://embed.mibbit.com/up/DVO4FhPB.jpg
<Yahoo> Hmmm..............Look on a font site and type is something
<SpyroMad156> 3DA FREAK!!
<SpyroMad156> 3DA FREAK!!
<SpyroMad156> 3DA FREAK!
<SpyroMad156> 3:D
<SpyroMad156> 3http://embed.mibbit.com/up/cVivtqgW.jpg
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: That is NOT helpful, and I'm not downloading any fonts. I'm talking about on bloody word.
<Kjakings> 7Kunstler Script and Imprint MT Shadow are OK, Imprint better, but still not quite right
<SpyroMad156> 3http://embed.mibbit.com/up/tuzof9QX.jpg http://embed.mibbit.com/up/DotXfJjH.jpg
<DDR_Maniac> Those fonts aren't even on my Word
<DDR_Maniac> o_O
<SpyroMad156> 3ppl...im annoying type it...prove it...
<Kjakings> 7What word version do you have?
<Kjakings> 7I'm using 2007
<DDR_Maniac> Yeah, same
<gerpie> i'm thinking of going to sleep T_T
<Kjakings> 7Weird
<DDR_Maniac> I liked the old Word better than 2007
<Kjakings> 7I prefer 2007 to be honest
<Kjakings> 7I'm still getting used to it, but I think it has better functionality and I'm in love with that little bar on the top
<DDR_Maniac> It always locks up and stuff, but that might just be my computer
<Kjakings> 7Never locked up for me
<gerpie> cya guys
<DDR_Maniac> Heh
<DDR_Maniac> My computer is crap
<Kjakings> 7So is mine. Yours is probably just that little bit crapper. :P
<DDR_Maniac> Do you have Vista too?
<Kjakings> 7Except I bought a years membership on this game, and now both firefox AND IE crash whenever I try to play it. The internet is screwing with me.
<Kjakings> 7Yesh, I haz vista
<DDR_Maniac> Hopefully that game didn't cost too much
<Kjakings> 7£32, but it was money my bro owed me.
<DDR_Maniac> I almost even prefer the slow school computers over the one here sometimes
<DDR_Maniac> How much is £32? [/dumb american]
<Kjakings> 7Erm, at the time it was $55
<Kjakings> 7But I think the exchange rate's shifted since then
<DDR_Maniac> At least it wasn't your own money then
<Stormy> Hai people
<DDR_Maniac> Oh hi
<Kjakings> 7Hi
<Kjakings> 7Rainy :P
<Kjakings> 7Hummm... I need a new name for you. Thundery?
<Kjakings> 7Naw, doesn't flow.
<Stormy> =P
<DDR> I was still logged in?
<Stormy> Yes
<Stormy> There
<Stormy> :)
<DDR> Something called Data Execution Prevention closed Firefox
<DDR> Wtf?
<Stormy> Hmmm
<Stormy> Clearly it was trying to prevent something from executing data.
<Stormy> :P
<SpyroMad156> 3stormy!
<DDR> You are so clever
<Kjakings> 7Thank you, Admiral Obvious
<SpyroMad156> 3you bitch
<Kjakings> 7o_O
<Stormy> Excuse me?
<DDR> Uhhh....
<Kjakings> 7SR's never gunna forgive him for that
<Stormy> Why do you say that?
<Yahoo> Uh oh
<DDR> (psst, Stormy, now's the time to kick)
<Kjakings> 7Oh holy fu- WE HAVE A CODE YELLOW PEOPLE! CODE YELLOW!
<Kjakings> 7RUN FOR THE HILLS
<SpyroMad156> 3cuz ur a fukin spyro disser!
<DDR> but the hills have eyes
<Stormy> Oh, just let me argue a bit
<DDR> O_O
<Stormy> Then I'll ckick
<Kjakings> 7DDR: I KNOW! The mods have such /terrible/ kick/ban sense, don't they?
<SpyroMad156> 3u unkle faka!U R Gay!
<Stormy> SpyroMad156: I don't like the new Spyro, and there is nothing wrong with that
<DDR> Both Aicebo and Stormy didn't kick when someone called them a bitch
<Stormy> If you don't agree with me, that's OK
<SpyroMad156> 3U Own the store: Gay's R Us!
<Stormy> But there is no need to call me a bitch for having a different opinion than you
<SpyroMad156> 3brb
<Stormy> Oh, no you won't.
<DDR> XD
<Stormy> Wow, loser
<DDR> That was....amusing
<Kjakings> 7Stormy's epic kick. The new chapter of spyrochat~
<Stormy> What is it with people and hating me because I don't like TLoS?
<Stormy> -_____-
<DDR> They're little kids who shouldn't be on the internet
<Stormy> Yep, exactlky
<Stormy> *exactly
<Kjakings> 7I disagree, but I also agree that the original (by original, I mean insomniac) ones were better
<Stormy> Maybe I should ban that guy on SpyroForum too....
<DDR> This laptop's giving you trouble typing, eh?
<DDR> :P
<Stormy> Disagree with what, Kjakings?
<Stormy> People should hate me for not liking TLoS? =P
<Stormy> yeah, the keyboard's a bit small
<Stormy> 8.9 inch laptop
<Kjakings> 7That TLoS is bad/whatever you say about it. We had like the one discussion and left it.
<Stormy> Oh, yeah
<Stormy> Well, if you like it, that's cool; it's just not my thing
<Stormy> And I like to make fun of it
<Stormy> =P
<Kjakings> 7I like it because, and I quote my brother here, "Beating up monkeys on an elevator in a dark fortress towards the evil dragon queen."
<Stormy> Mmph... where's SR when you need him =/
<Stormy> Hahaha, that's exactly what I don't like about it
<Stormy> That combat gameplay gives me a headache
<Stormy> And the story is cliche and predictable
<Stormy> And it's too linear
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, but MONKEHZ!
<DDR> I don't hate it as much as you
<Stormy> LOOOOL yeah
<DDR> But...I still don't like it much
<Stormy> Yeah, I don't completely HATE it
<Stormy> It's just not a very good series
<prince-dari> Still arguing with this guy about logic.
<prince-dari> I'm winnning.
<prince-dari> About 3 hours into the argument.
<Stormy> and it happens to have helped kill my favorite series
<DDR> Who are you arguing now?
<Stormy> =P
<DDR> *arguing with
<Stormy> Hey guys? Do you think I should ban that SpyroMad idiot?
<Stormy> On SF?
<DDR> He didn't do anything there
<Stormy> They were arguing with me about it there, too
<Stormy> Sort of
<Kjakings> 7Do it.
<DDR> Wait, and if he does something bad, ban him without warning
<Stormy> I'll give him a short ban, I think
<Kjakings> 7You only answer to SR, and he's not going to question you.
<Stormy> Not permanent
<Stormy> Hmm
<DDR> yeah, that's a good idea
<DJX> ?
<DJX> Hi.
<DDR> Hello
<Stormy> Hey
<DJX> I'm excited/
<DDR> Why's that?
<DJX> I'm getting something on Monday, I hope.
<prince-dari> I won.
<prince-dari> He gave up.
<prince-dari> Hah.
<prince-dari> I WIN!
<Stormy> OK, Spyromad156 is now banned for 7 days
<Stormy> =P
<prince-dari> I HAVE PROVED THAT LOGIC IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS CAN BE DERIVED FROM OPINION, IF THE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE!
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
<DJX> Who is this person that keeps on?
<DJX> "Ayumi"?
<prince-dari> Anyone want to oppose me?
<Stormy> Ayumi was here?
<Kjakings> 7No, go away. No-one cares.
<DDR> prince-dari: Who were you arguing with?
<Stormy> when?
<Kjakings> 7(@dari)
<prince-dari> Some guy on another server
<DJX> I dk
<Stormy> He's supposed to be permanently banned
<prince-dari> Kjakings: No, you don't care and are big headed and stupid enough to think that you are spokesperson for everyone here.
<DDR> No one said he was here
<DJX> Why?
<prince-dari> It is possible (although unlikely) that other people are interested.
<DDR> Looong story
<prince-dari> You shouldn't assume that you know what everyone else is thinking.
<DJX> Long story?
<DDR> Yeah
<Stormy> Yup
<Stormy> Ayumi caused a lot of trouble on this chat and made hate threads on the forums
<DDR> Lets just say it might take about a half hour to tell the entire thing
<Yahoo> Uhhh what happened while I was gone or should I just crawl back in my hole/shell
<DJX> ?
<Stormy> So we decided we would be better off without him :)
<Stormy> That's it in a nutshell
<DJX> :O
<DDR> I say good riddance
<Stormy> Seconded
<Stormy> :L
<Kjakings> 7I say we poke him some more :P
<DJX> But you aren't better off w/o him, he helped the forums you know.
<DDR> Um, how?
<Kjakings> 7Ok, this guy is making me suspitious.
<prince-dari> Same.
<prince-dari> Proxy I think.
<Stormy> Hmm, I'd say he caused a lot more trouble than he helped.
<Kjakings> 7 5-1 odds on being Ayumi, 3-1 on being a supporter/doppel.
<DJX> Nope.
<prince-dari> 899a4a19.4ip1.windstream.net
<Stormy> Yeah, I noticed that too =/
<prince-dari> O_o
<DJX> I support NO ONE.
<Kjakings> 7Shoo poochy.
<DJX> No.
<Stormy> I repeat, where is SR when you need him? D=
<DJX> I wanted to come on chat.
<Stormy> Who are you?
<prince-dari> Ayumi.
<DDR> ...
<Stormy> Are you Ayumi?
<DJX> Why do you hate me?
<Stormy> DJX: Are you Ayumi?
<DJX> What if?
<Kjakings> 7Because you're a retard
<Stormy> Are you?
<Kjakings> 7 22:27	DJX	Why do you hate me? Confirmation.
<DDR> How about you let Stormy deal with this, eh guys?
<DDR> -_-
<DJX> No one asked for your opinion.
<Kjakings> 7You phail at stealth.
<Stormy> Three seconds to answer, yes or no, then I kick.
<Stormy> Are you Ayumi?
<Stormy> Simple enough question
<Kjakings> 7You phail at stealth ayumi
<DJX> You phail at life Kj.
<Kjakings> 7Go crawl into your kennel
<Stormy> Everyone Shh
<DJX> You phail at life Kj.
<Stormy> Answer the question, DJX
<Stormy> Who are you?
<Kjakings> 7Oooh. The big-bad wolf is gunna eat me
<Kjakings> 7I R SCARED
<Stormy> If you don't answer I will kick
<prince-dari> Things!
<prince-dari> Lawl
<DDR> Stormy: Take Kjakings' voice.
<DDR> :P
<Kjakings> 7Hey
<DJX> Ayumi, BUT, Don't ban me. I've done nothing wrong.
<Stormy> -______-
<Kjakings> 7Don't take my voice when I'm pwning my arch-enemy
<prince-dari> Actually you're banned and coming here while banned is breaking rules.
<DDR> Yes Ayumi, you've done plenty wrong
<Stormy> Ayumi, what part of being banned do you not understand?
<Stormy> You've done a lot of things wrong
<Stormy> We don't want you here anymore after what you've done
<DJX> How is that so punk.
<Stormy> "Punk"?
<Stormy> =P
<DJX> fine...You all fail at life.
<prince-dari> What's he talking about now?
<Kjakings> 7I say he doesn't understand the past-tense qualifier, meaning that since he was /banned/ the action is in the past, therefore not directly affecting the present.
<Stormy> Excuse me? No,
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7You phail at insults
<Kjakings> 7n00b
<DJX> FU.
<Kjakings> 7I'm keeping my eye on you from now on
<Stormy> I'm not the one who made hate threads and swore at people on chat
<Kjakings> 7And trust me, I can do a lot.
<Kjakings> 7You will leave here ayumi
<DJX> You provoked me to.
<Kjakings> 7Now.
<Stormy> Clearly we have nothing useful to say to each other, so...
<DDR> And why is he still here?
<DJX> Nope.
<Stormy> Umm, what was that? I provoked you?
<Kjakings> 7My god
<DDR> You people want more drama or something
<DDR> ?
<Stormy> No, I did nothing to you
<DJX> To chat.
<Kjakings> 7You're SO easy to manipulate
<Aicebo> 13Rawr
<Yahoo> Holy shit
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo!
<DJX> Be quiet.
<Yahoo> Hi Aicebo
<Aicebo> 13Woah wait

<Kjakings> 7MOTHER-FUCKER
<DJX> Finally.
<Stormy> Oi, Kjakings
<DJX> NO, You are KJ.
<Aicebo> 13Guys...
<Stormy> Stop it, Ayumi
<Stormy> Seriously, you're not welcome here anymore
<Kjakings> 7Every time it says devoice I think it says devorce lol.
<prince-dari> You might want to ban the proxy he's using as well.
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Aicebo> 13Guys...
<Aicebo> 13Seriously...
<DDR> Aicebo: He's trying to get around a ban that he deserved
<Aicebo> 13He's left us alone for some time now
<DDR> He shouldn't be here
<Stormy> Aicebo: We're not letting him back
<Aicebo> 13Can I give you guys what I even think?
<DDR> Go ahead
<prince-dari> If you want, won't change anything.
<Yahoo> I'm staying out of this, I am WAY too busy to get into this argument
<Aicebo> 13The whole reason he acts up every time is because you guys are rude to him straight away! I'm sure he DOES want to apologize, you guys just fire him up before he gets the chance!
<Yahoo> (Yes, i ahve updaated myself)
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: A ban is a ban.
<Kjakings> 7The third law of modular robotics.
<Yahoo> Well, that is kinda Kieran's characteristics
<prince-dari> Someone ban *!*@ip.windstream.net
<Yahoo> Now I run
<DDR> I agree that Kjakings and prince-dari do need to keep their mouths shut sometimes
<Stormy> SR is coming
<DDR> But a ban is a ban
<Stormy> Let him take care of it
<Kjakings> 7Indeed
<DDR> He shouldn't have come back in the first place
<Aicebo> 13Ok.
<prince-dari> Someone ban *!*@ip.windstream.net
<prince-dari> ...
<Stormy> Aicebo, he has more than earned a permanent ban; we're not letting him back
<Yahoo> Okay, I shall stay
<Mage> haha
<prince-dari> The proxy he's using...
<Kjakings> 7I should be writing this prologue, and it's like quarter to 11
<Aicebo> 13Ok.
<prince-dari> Why will no one ban the proxy he's using...?
<Yahoo> HOLY SHIT
<DDR> Because you are telling them too Dari
<prince-dari> Thank you.
<Yahoo> KIERAN YOU JUST SAVED MY BUTT THANK YOU
<DDR> :P
<Stormy> Hey, language
<Kjakings> 7No problem?
<Yahoo> Woops sorry
<Stormy> OK, now hopefully that worked
<Aicebo> 13I thought SR was going to handle it.
<Stormy> Thanks prince dari
<Stormy> He can't get into mibbit
<Aicebo> 13oh...
<prince-dari> He's just going to get another proxy you know.
<Mage> lets hope noone else is using that ISP they try to get in
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Stormy> Yeah, probably
<Things> Ayumi changed ISP's to get in ?!?!
<DDR> Is it still possible for him to get in?
<Mage> That would be
<Mage> LOL
<Things> Uh
<prince-dari> New proxy
<DJX> ...
<prince-dari> Lawl
<DDR> Am I the only one who doesn't know what an ISP is?
<Stormy> Evan, I'm going to ask SR if I can give you op so you can help with this, OK?
<DJX> lloll
<Stormy> I'm going to have to go soon
<Things> ddr, internet service provider
<Aicebo> 13DDR: No
<DDR> Okay
<DJX> Listen.
<Mage> no
<DDR> Aicebo: Glad I'm not the only one
<DDR> XD
<DDR> o_O
<Things> lolol
<Stormy> ...What are you doing?
<Things> Umm try
<Stormy> Why am I admin; I have no clue what I'm doing.... D=
<Things> hmmm
<Mage> that should do it
<Things> Mage, yeah
<Stormy> What did you just do?
<Things> thats what I was thinking
<Stormy> Unbanned something?
<Yahoo> ......stupid IE
<Mage> you forgot a .
<A_Guy> 12You know something that I've always wondered?
<DDR> So can DJX get back in, or what?
<A_Guy> 12If someone is invisible, shouldn't they also be blind?
<Mage> he shouldnt be able to
<Yahoo> Hey you missed it
<Yahoo> :P
<Mage> ....
<Things> DDR, no :P
<DDR> Okay, that's good
<Mage> unless he like
<Mage> changes his ISP
<Things> Unless he gets a new proxie
<Things> Or that
<Things> lol
<Rurik> 4??
<Mage> in which case I'll ban that one too
<DDR> I'll just pretend I understand
<DDR> :P
<Stormy> OK, you guys look like you've got it taken care of =P
<Yahoo> Yes, AYumi came back rurik
<Mage> :X k
<Stormy> I'll bbl
<Rurik> 4He did?
<A_Guy> 12Who's this DJX guy?
<Rurik> 4when?
<Yahoo> Yes, he did
<Aicebo> 13A_Guy: Ayumi.
<Stormy> It's ayumi
<prince-dari> Well on other networks, they have banned people from joining at all using mibbit.
<Yahoo> Minutes ago
<A_Guy> 12Ah.
<prince-dari> By using that number thing in their mibbit hostname.
<Rurik> 4FUCK! I missed it
<Things> prince-dari, I wouldn't minddoing that either :P
<Yahoo> By minutes
<Stormy> Rurik: Language
<Things> Mibbit just makes it hard to ban people :P
<Rurik> 4Don't know why I care, but w/e
<Rurik> 4Stormy: Yes mother
<prince-dari> /whowas DJX
<prince-dari> /whowas DRX
<Mage> yeaaah
<prince-dari> /whowas DJX
<Things> Well, and proxies
<prince-dari> For example *!899a4a19@webchat.mibbit.com
<Mage> devoicing is always fun though, just because you know theyre staying in there to read what you type, creepy.
<prince-dari> That should ban him from using mibbit and joining here at all.
<Things> prince-dari, try *!*@*webchat.mibbit.com
<Things> :P
<Mage> haha
<Mage> there goes the neighborhood
<prince-dari> Well in the banlist on the other place it's like that, and it works.
<Things> Indeed lol
<prince-dari> So no, you don't need that. :P
<prince-dari> I win Things.
<Things> Well *!*@* would get rid of all the stupid ppl too :P
<prince-dari> Or you could do *!*899a4a19*@*
<prince-dari> If you ban that it would definitely stop him from coming back using mibbit.
<prince-dari> Don't think it would affect anyone else.
<prince-dari> Not 100% sure though.
<Stormy> I tried that, prince-dari
<Things> hbsvhsdkvadbnegtn
<Stormy> I think that's what you suggested before, so I tried it
<prince-dari> Meh, it should work.
<Mage> asdfsgsfas
<Stormy> And he still came back
<Things> hjdsghafg?
<Mage> FAGSAYGDsa
<Rurik> 4O HAI SPYROROCKS
<Things> HGJJFGEFJUWF???
<Mage> fsdfgdfs
<Aicebo> 13Hey SR
<Spyrorocks> Sup
<Things> :P
<prince-dari> What was suggested before had one less asterisk.
<prince-dari> Maybe that would make a difference, lol.
<Stormy> Wow, nice timing
<Kjakings> 7Oh, you guys are /so/ stupid! All you need to due is adapt your visors to focus on the upper-theta-quasi-nitro-band and search for protogenic-tachy-chronomitons! It's so simple! *Can_spout_technobabble_too*
<Stormy> =P
<Kjakings> 7Gtg bye
<DDR> Banning people sounds really confusing
<Things> Fun tho
<Spyrorocks> things: do we have a DNSBL set for epicchat?
<Things> :P
<Things> Spyrorocks, not sure, you'd have to ask Ari
<A_Guy> 12SR, I have a question about Javascript.
<Spyrorocks> Lets see if he comes back
<DDR> He hasn't for about 10 minutes now
<Things> Doubt it lol
<Spyrorocks> you probably screwed him.
<Things> Unless he gets another proxy or ISP
<Spyrorocks> he was on windstream?
<DDR> I have an idea, if he joins, everyone quit
<DDR> :P
<A_Guy> 12What do you do if you want something else to happen if a string is given instead of a number?
<Yahoo> Ya SR
<prince-dari> Ahahahahahaha, someone just Sajoined a spammer to 2500 channels on a different server.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> Lag much?
<Things> Hahaha yeah
<Things> thats stupid :P
<Spyrorocks> A_Guy: Theres a "typedef" operator you can use to detirmine the datatype for a variable in javascript
<Things> server-bandwidth-wastin
<Things> g
*Stormy pretends to understand what that means
<Stormy> Yeah, that's pretty stupid *nods*
*RedDragonX does the same
*DDR joins the club
<A_Guy> 12Ah, really?
<Spyrorocks> *!*@*.ip.windstream.net
<A_Guy> 12Thanks.
*Rurik 4points and laughs at the people who don't get it, though he doesn't understand it either
<Mage> Muhuahah
<RedDragonX> thanks Rurik lol
<Rurik> 4welcome
<DDR> Well, I have to go
<DDR> Bye everyone

<cynderfire> nuuuuuuu
<Shadowsfall> unless you come out at night
<Neon> WHy, you're dying?
<Neon> :P
<Shadowsfall> -_-
<Stormy> Hey guys, does anyone here know how to use photoshop?
<Shadowsfall> anyway i got to go
<Shadowsfall> bye everyone
<Stormy> I have sort of a stupid question =P
<cynderfire> bye shadow
<Stormy> Bye Shadowsfall
<Neon> Bye SHadowfell.
<Shadowsfall> *fall
<Shadowsfall> bye bye
<cynderfire> lol
<Neon> Shadowsfall unless you come out at night I go out every night to pillage/eat flesh.
<cynderfire> GOD DAMMIT!!!! My tooth is wobblin
<cynderfire> i made it worse -_-
<Neon> You're still losin' teeth?
<Kjakings> 7All my teeth were out when I was like 11
<Neon> Same.
<Kjakings> 7Although there's this 14 year old on my bus who still has like half of his baby teeth left.
<Stormy> Haha, I'm 17 and I still have one left =P
<Kjakings> 7I also have two wisdom teeth, had them for like a year and a half.
<Neon> Is that possible?
<Neon> :P
<Stormy> It's probably never going to fall out
<Stormy> Yeah, apparently it is :P
<Stormy> It's one of the front ones
<Stormy> The dentist keeps asking if it "bothers me" every time I go there =P
<Kjakings> 7I lost my two front teeth when I was like 4, never sat on those McDonalds high-seats with the big table near the windows things again.
<Neon> XDDD
<Neon> I got a tooth knocked out when I was young.
<Neon> So did my dad. His brother hit him and like suffocated him under a couch cushion.
<Neon> XD
<cynderfire> i gtg
<Neon> Baibai
<Kjakings> 7My brother's 18, and 5 and a half years older than me. He's never beaten me in a fight (I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point).
<Stormy> where is the stupid fill tool in photoshop?!
<Stormy> Blarg
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: If you want to fill something, turn it over to paint, fill it there, and then put it back in Photoshop.
<Stormy> >_> Seriously?
<Kjakings> 7That's what I'd do.
<Kjakings> 7I hate Photoshop, much prefer paint.
<Stormy> hmmm... I'll just use fireworks I guess
<Kjakings> 7For colouring things etc anyway.
<Neon> (I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point). Lawl.
<Stormy> Paint is somewhat limited with the filling thing
<Kjakings> 7And I know someone who insists that Photoshop is better for spriting, and every day I tell them they're spouting bull.
<Neon> I wish i had a brother. Instead I'm stuck with an entirely female house and I'm unfavored. :P
<Stormy> Why aren't they teaching us photoshop instead of fireworks.... D:
<Kjakings> 7Brb
<DarkCynder> 14Hi all
<Stormy> hi
<Neon> Hi DarkCyndar.
<DarkCynder> 14How is everyone? :)
<Stormy> Annoyed at stupid photoshop T__T
<DarkCynder> 14LOL!
<DarkCynder> 14Which version?
<Stormy> Could they make it just a little harder to fill stuff in.... >_>
<Stormy> Umm, CS3 I think
<DarkCynder> 14Ah I have no idea on that one
<DarkCynder> 14I use Paint Shop Pro 3
<Stormy> I use GIMP usually
<Stormy> But these school computers don't have GIMP =P
<Neon> GIMP isn't helpful, IMO.
<DarkCynder> 14lol
<Neon> Paint serves more of my needs.
<Neon> No homo.
<Kjakings> 7Bax
<Stormy> And I thought it might be helpful to learn photoshop in case I feel like spending a fortune on it some day
<Neon> Hai Kayjay
<DarkCynder> 14I stick to PSP3 and AS3
<DarkCynder> 14brb
<Neon> Please insert a quarter.
<Stormy> No

<Kjakings> 7http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=39212&st=0 O alas! If only Aicebo Pastebin were here!
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Stormy> Haha, I just finished reading the second of those twilight things yesterday
<Stormy> it wasn't THAT bad; I was expecting much worse
<Kjakings> 7I'm not going to waste money on them
<Stormy> I didn't buy them
<Stormy> School library
<Kjakings> 7It's probably much like the big build-up to Star Wars 3 (I don't care if you're not a fan, the comparison works), everyone thought it was going to be epic, and they were disappointed because of all the build-up and they expected much more. I suppose it's going to be much the same, but opposite, for Twilight.
<Kjakings> 7If my school library gets them I MAY read.
<Stormy> Have to admit, Bella was starting to get on my nerves
<Stormy> She's freaking obsessed with that Edward guy
<Stormy> Jumping off cliffs to hear his voice in her head....
<Stormy> Sulking for 6 months after he leaves....
<Stormy> Seriously, get a life
<Stormy> And all she ever says about him is how perfect he looks
<Kjakings> 7I MAY buy them, just to see how many crappy books it takes to stop some deagle fire.
<Stormy> Looks, that's all she cares about, and they "love" eachother
<Stormy> *each other

<Spyrorocks> I told that to one of my IRL female friends

<Mage> i actually hang out with a couple girls who would laugh at that
<Ryft> haha, me too

<prince-dari> Like Kjakings? Lol.
<Spyrorocks> Yes
<Spyrorocks> Kiern Jakings doesn't sound like a real name
<prince-dari> DFOKN asked me if Kjakings was male or female, and I told him that he was female, to which responded "Ah, I though so, he has many feminine qualities", or something like that, I'll see if I can find exactly what he said.
<Spyrorocks> Thats priceless.
<prince-dari> Here we go.

<Ryft> o-o
<Spyrorocks> Mage caught one of my quotes and put it in the topic
<Spyrorocks> and make me laugh
<Kjakings> 7I know like three dozen Brads, about half of which remind me of you. It's in the name I suppose, like all guys with the name/middle name of Lesley turn out the stereotypical 'gay'.
<Spyrorocks> http://pastie.org/380457
<Spyrorocks> Tonight, I did the following things onspyrochat
<Spyrorocks> 1. made fun of various races of people
<Spyrorocks> 2. made fun of ryft
<Spyrorocks> 3. made fun of furries
<Ryft> not really
<Spyrorocks> 4. talked about boobies
<Ryft> just bugged me
<Spyrorocks> 5. ummmm oh yeah I told some whoopie goldburg jokes
<Spyrorocks> 6. told stormy that she "was on doppel like ugly on whoopie goldburg"
<Spyrorocks> In other words, It was a good day.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7Nice
<Ryft> after tonight, SR you've made me curious
<Ryft> Kja, do you think i'm a girl?
<Spyrorocks> Now that takes me to 1:30am and have ran out of material.
<Spyrorocks> Ryft: I thought Kjakings was a chick too.
<Ryft> XD
<Ryft> just asking
<Spyrorocks> Its the whole furry thing, it makes you seem like a chick.
<Ryft> i'm just curious to see what everyone on here thinks
<Kjakings> 7He got it wrong like three times until I got pissed and yelled at him.
<Ryft> hehe
<Spyrorocks> Only good thing about furries is that my gay furry friend in Utah has a bunch of furry chick friends who are not lesbians who live in Utah, so if I am ever in Utah I am totally grabbing a few of them.
<Ryft> XD
<Spyrorocks> Or have him mail me a couple, either way.
<Ryft> heh
<Spyrorocks> I could probably stick them in cages and feed them cat food.
<prince-dari> LOL
<Ryft> heh
<Spyrorocks> actually, thats a good question, let me ask someone if furries eat cat food....
<Ryft> no
<Ryft> they don't
<prince-dari> Some probably do.
<Ryft> unless they have a separate problem
<prince-dari> I expect Ayumi eats dog food.
<Spyrorocks> YES furries do eat cat food
<Spyrorocks> I have confirmation
<Ryft> only some od
<Ryft> *do
<Spyrorocks> http://pastie.org/380460 Mature content
<Spyrorocks> Thats my answer.
<Spyrorocks> Ryft: Your a fox so therefor you eat dog food.
<Spyrorocks> Theres a difference.
<Ryft> no
<Ryft> i eat chicken thank you
<Spyrorocks> and no, human foxes do not turn me on.
<Ryft> good
<Spyrorocks> Do you have a food dish?
<Ryft> it's called a cereal bowl
<Spyrorocks> and tell your parents to put your dinner in a dish so you can eat it off the ground?
<Ryft> nope
<Spyrorocks> What kind of poser furry are you?
<Spyrorocks> Levi just wants ass.
<Spyrorocks> But he has a total suit with fur on it and pretends to be a fox.
<prince-dari> "I just want to nail me some cat girl" <--- Lul
<Ryft> o-o

<rutger> 4 8D
<Spyrorocks> Hey man, this is a chat about a purple dragon

<rutger> 4lal
<Spyrorocks> Good call.
<Spyrorocks> dutch green club
<rutger> 4Isn't it kinda double having a purple dragon chat on a site named after green frogs?
<Spyrorocks> Mibbit isn't my site
<rutger> 4no shit sherlock
<rutger> 4but still
<Spyrorocks> so why did you ask
<prince-dari> Mibbit is a piece of crap.

<rutger> 4well
<Spyrorocks> its not my site
<rutger> 4NO
<rutger> 4BUT
<prince-dari> I got myself banned from the mibbit network.
<rutger> 4I knew I had a point somewhere
<Kjakings> 7I have two friends on steam, £20 says they're furries. One even grew out his hair to look like a mane, and 90% of the conversations I have with the other one start with him saying "Why does Pete like to torture me?!" and I'd totally ditch the both of them if they weren't epic mappers.
<rutger> 4it's because all of this goddamned furries
<rutger> 4They're raping my mental asshole
<prince-dari> From explaining on their main channel, #mibbit, how mibbit is so extremely crappy.
<Spyrorocks> rutger only likes the furry chicks
<rutger> 4Quite so.
<Spyrorocks> With good reason.
<rutger> 4Oh yes
<Spyrorocks> Its like the disneyland parade.
<Spyrorocks> Except less mexicans
<rutger> 4Social outcasts = sex like there's no tomorrow, that combined with the absolute kinkyness of catgirls
<rutger> 4??
<rutger> 4PROFIT
<Spyrorocks> Totally.
<Spyrorocks> Makes perfect sense.
<rutger> 4And less mexicans, no doubt.
<Spyrorocks> They are completely insecure and suggestible.
<rutger> 4lol, I remember we once planned a habbo raid here
<rutger> 4like
<rutger> 4years ago
<Spyrorocks> did we?

<Ryft> nice
*Ryft got a 360 today!
*Rurik 4doesn't care!
<prince-dari> It's a conspiracy!
<RedDragonX> I'll stick to my PS3 lol
<Ryft> hehe
<prince-dari> Wii > All
<prince-dari> PS3 is dragging Sony down.
<RedDragonX> and I care why?
<prince-dari> If they don't drop PS3, they might crash and burn. Lol.
<RedDragonX> I don't care because I like the games and have the money to get them
<RedDragonX> and it plays blue reay
<RedDragonX> "ray"
<RedDragonX> so I'm satisfied
<prince-dari> Blu ray has been beaten by HD, it will become extinct.
<Ryft> XD
<Spyrorocks> Playstation products have a long lifespan.
<prince-dari> PS3 has made huge losses for Sony.
<RedDragonX> why are you trying to prove points that I could really care less about lol
<prince-dari> I'm bored.
<prince-dari> Very bored.
<RedDragonX> apparently
<Charlie_Pace> O R YA?
<prince-dari> Yes.
<Spyrorocks> Why would RedDragonX care if the PS3 has caused sony losses?
<prince-dari> When did I say he would?
<RedDragonX> WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO POINT IT OUT TO ME WHEN I DON'T CARE
<Spyrorocks> You inferred it.
<prince-dari> No I didn't, you assumed it.
<Spyrorocks> Why did you say it then?You ovbiously have some sort of point your trying to prove
<prince-dari> And it was in response to you saying that Playstation products have a long lifespan, and it's because I'm bored.
<prince-dari> When I'm bored, I argue, about anything really.
<RedDragonX> then go find something usefull of your time
<prince-dari> Nothing useful to do. :P
<RedDragonX> go outside or something
<prince-dari> Too dark/Cold.
<RedDragonX> go for a drive...oh wait...nevermind
<prince-dari> :P
<Charlie_Pace> We could turn off the radar blocker in the Looking Glass.
<RedDragonX> I'm glad I can drive

<prince-dari> -BE TRUTHFUL. This means, when she asks you, "Does this look good on
<prince-dari> me?", It's okay to say no. She wants the truth.
<prince-dari> *Slap*
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> I think that's a bit stupid, of course they want you to lie to them in situations like that.
<Stormy> That's why I don't ask people if stuff looks good on me
<Charlie_Pace> Haha, it's a mental regulator, not a lie-detector test. They justw ant you to reassur them even though they know sometimes it doesn't look good or whatever.
<Charlie_Pace> *just want, reassure
<Stormy> Because if they say yes, it means nothing because they could easily be lying
<RedDragonX> SR you should have gave them that quote I said
<Spyrorocks> what quote was that?
<RedDragonX> I'm trying to remember lol
<RedDragonX> you said you were gonna save it 0.o...
<Charlie_Pace> Deranged Dr. Remehov.
<prince-dari> I thought Stormy and DDR had only one computer? O_o
<Stormy> I got a laptop
<DDR> No, she has a laptop
<Charlie_Pace> ^ O MAI
<RedDragonX> hm
<prince-dari> I should block google.
<prince-dari> On the router, my dad would probably think his precious computer got a virus.
<prince-dari> Heheheh.
<prince-dari> Simpletons.
<DDR> and what would happen when he found out there was no virus?
<prince-dari> He wouldn't.
<prince-dari> I'm too good for him.
<DDR> Oh, I see
<prince-dari> I should also block all social networking sites.
<prince-dari> And MSN.
<Charlie_Pace> LOL, skip to 45: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_HYu-ds-Go
<DDR> Stormy's off to do her chores, I'll bet
<DDR> :P
<prince-dari> And make the internet stop on their computers after a certain time.
<Spyrorocks> She ran when your mom came home.
<DDR> Yep
<prince-dari> I've always wondered why do Americans (I say Americans because I think it originated there, not sure) say 'Mom', with an o?
<DDR> Yeah
<prince-dari> Rather than with a u?
<Charlie_Pace> Because it comes from the word mother.
<Charlie_Pace> :P
<DDR> I haven't heard anyone say mum
<Charlie_Pace> Mum is actually less like the ENglish language.
<prince-dari> Not really.
<Spyrorocks> Mom = Mother
<prince-dari> The proper English language is strange.
<Charlie_Pace> Is it muther?
<Charlie_Pace> No.
<prince-dari> With random irregularities.
<prince-dari> Such as the past tense of dive being dived, where as Americans made up dove.
<Charlie_Pace> "So that's the plan, Destiny Maaaaaaaan?!"
<Spyrorocks> "I dove" sounds better than "I dived"
<prince-dari> But it is incorrect. :P
<Spyrorocks> Dove is much less awkward to say
<prince-dari> Well, here at least.
<prince-dari> DFOKN FOR MODERATOR!
<Charlie_Pace> :P
<Spyrorocks> I think the UK is incorrect.
<prince-dari> And you are wrong.
<Spyrorocks> Everyone here knows im always right.
<Ryft> oh yeah...
<DragonFireOKN> Actually, you said Kjakings was a girl once.
<DragonFireOKN> 2:)
<prince-dari> Oh, you found out that he wasn't a girl?
<DDR> That could be right
<DDR> :P
<DragonFireOKN> 2Oh wait....you were right....
<DragonFireOKN> 2nevermind.
<Spyrorocks> going for a walk, be back later
<Charlie_Pace> Lol, did DFOKN ever say anything to KJ about him being "female?"
<DDR> It's warm enough for a walk?
<DragonFireOKN> 2Yep
<DDR> Lucky.

<DDR> Still too cold for a walk
<DDR> How is it that it's warmer in Canada farther from the Equator?
<DDR> >_>
<DragonFireOKN> 2Could be a warm front
<prince-dari> NUUU GEOGRAPHY ^
<DDR> That's like...basic 3rd grade geography :P
<prince-dari> Yeah, but I hate geography. :P
<prince-dari> Well I hated the teacher.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I had an old fatty for a Geography teacher in 7th grade.
<DragonFireOKN> 2He was my track coach.
<DDR> I always have cool teachers for Geography and Social Studies classes
<Aicebo> 13back
<prince-dari> My first Geography teacher worked in lindt before.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Darn....
<DDR> The worst teachers are usually Science
*DragonFireOKN 2imagines Rick Rolling SR and him not being able to leave the page due to slow internet connection.
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Someone has to have made a Rick Rolling virus.
<prince-dari> Then I could send it to school.
<prince-dari> It would take over the network.
<DDR> Was Charlie_Pace Neon?
<Aicebo> 13Yeah
<prince-dari> And play Rick Astley endlessly.
<Aicebo> 13He kept saying "Charlie Pace" earlier
<DDR> I thought so
<Aicebo> 13So I'm guessing yes
*DDR looks up Charlie Pace on Wikipedia
<Emperor_Obama> Opps.
<prince-dari> I'm guessing that's Neon.
<Emperor_Obama> Wrong site.

<Stormy> No
<Stormy> Why, did you?
<Neon> Project N.E.O.N. has arrived: http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/shadow.jpg :P
<prince-dari> Nope, I was just wondering.
<DragonFireOKN> 2LOL
<Aicebo> 13Hey Neon
<prince-dari> /notice DragonFireOKN Yeah, she's lying.
<Neon> Hey,

<Neon> Curses.
<Neon> The picture won't work once you click on it.
<Stormy> bai
<DragonFireOKN> 2True, Dari
<DragonFireOKN> 2Wait..............how can DDR and Stormy be on at once?
<prince-dari> I asked that. Or something like it.
<Stormy> Because I got a laptop
<Stormy> =]
<prince-dari> Is that so you can have more private conversations with SR?
*prince-dari runs.
<Stormy> Don't be ridiculous
*DragonFireOKN 2imagines Stormbot and DDR sitting next to each other on their computers. DDR: "This is awkward. We're talking to each other via computers when we're only feet apart." Stormy: "Meh"
<Neon> ^ he's right.
<Stormy> I need a laptop because I'm going to college soon
<prince-dari> Nice excuse.
<Neon> College = Sir's House?
<prince-dari> The only way anyone in my family can get a response from me is if they talk to me via some kind of IM.
<Stormy> No
<DragonFireOKN> I know she has a pic of SR as her Desktop Backround.
<prince-dari> /notice DragonFireOKN LOL
<Stormy> >___>
<Neon> <___<
<Neon> Yes.
<DragonFireOKN> 2...
<prince-dari> /notice DragonFireOKN Once I edited a picture of a wall, and put loads of pictures of Stormy on it, showed it to her and said that it was SR's shrine to her.

<Neon> Egan left.
<DDR> You'd think the SR jokes might get old at one point
<DragonFireOKN> 2They don't.
<Stormy> Yeah, maybe =/
<Stormy> How about we make fun of Kjakings and Cynder7 instead?
<Stormy> They're all
<Aicebo> 13FIFTEEN SECONDS MACGRUBER!
<Stormy> "*hugs*"
<Stormy> And no one says anything about them
<prince-dari> Hugging SR in public, Stormy? Well that makes me wonder what you do in private...
<DragonFireOKN> 2Or we can make fun of Stormy. :)
<Aicebo> 13Apparently pissing off mods is more fun to them -____-
<Stormy> T________T
*prince-dari runs more.
<RedDragonX> how about we don't
<Stormy> Kjakings, Cynder7
<Stormy> Remember?
<prince-dari> I already made fun of Kjakings loads.
<Stormy> I said nothing about myself in that sentence =P
<prince-dari> It got boring.
<prince-dari> Eventually.
<Stormy> And making fun of me hasn't?
<DragonFireOKN> 2But Stormy's reactions are funny.
<prince-dari> You said <Stormy> *hugs SR*

<prince-dari> That's an illusion.
<prince-dari> SR edited it to protect you.
<DDR> It's even saved as a horrible quality JPEG picture
<Aicebo> 13XDDDDDDDDDDD
<Neon> Yeah he even dragged me into,.
<Neon> Said the safety of the forum was at stake.
<prince-dari> But I was fast enough to take a screenshot.
<Stormy> Of course
<Neon> Naturally he called me because, of course, I'm the best choice.
<Neon> JKJK
<Stormy> And that said screenshot took ten whole minutes to upload

<prince-dari> If I have to delete it, you must admit that you hugged SR in public.
<DragonFireOKN> 2After I'm done.
<Stormy> But I didn't.
<Stormy> It would be a lie.
<prince-dari> The evidence says otherwise.
<Stormy> The evidence has been tampered with
<Egan> My name is Christina!
<DDR> DragonFireOKN: Edit this one then
<DDR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cwO8Ng2x74&feature=channel_page
<Stormy> Anyone can tell if you scroll up that I never said that
<Egan> Aicebo: WHO ARE YOU!?
<Stormy> And anyway, even if I *did* say that
<prince-dari> Can you prove that the evidence has been tampered with.
<Stormy> It's just text
<Stormy> So I didn't actually hug anyone
<Stormy> :P
<prince-dari> Admit that you had intent to hug SR in public then.
<Egan> I believe you've hugged Abbey before.
<Egan> Or Cyndar.
<Stormy> But I didn't.
<Stormy> It would be a lie
<prince-dari> No, the evidence proves that you did.
<DDR> Just devoice prince-dari; it's that simple
<Stormy> Want me to get my own evidence?
<RedDragonX> wow you must be really bored to try proving things that didn't actually happen...and who cares if they did
<Stormy> Bahahaha
<DDR> No one would care
<DragonFireOKN> 2Mwahaha.
<prince-dari> And I can prove that SR edited what you said, extremely quickly with another screenshot of SR admiting to editing it.
<Egan> Don't devoice Dari.

<Kjakings> 7RDX: Wow, you show an amazing skill to take two completely unrelated things and then slam them together with duct tape, in the hope of making a coherent argument. Once, people were just talking while Aicebo was away for two hours, I think this was in November, when she suddenly comes back and starts screaming about people 'pissing her off for the hell of it' when the only thing people said when they noticed she wasn't away was either "Hi
<prince-dari> (Pissed off, not pissed as in drunk)
<N3[]N> This has happened before.
<N3[]N> At this level of blind fury.
<Kjakings> 7Yeah.
<Kjakings> 7She'll ban me first
<Kjakings> 7I betcha

<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: YEAH YOU GUYS FUCKING QUIT THE CAT RAPE SHIT AND ALL YOUR OTHER LITTLE JOKES YOU USE WITH ME IN THEM I HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH ALREADY AND I DON'T NEED YOUR DUMBASS PUNS AND COMMENTS RIGHT NOW

<N3[]N> 4^ He's right.
<prince-dari> Terminator: I SAID AMUSE ME NOW, FOOL!
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: Ok, a couple things wrong with that statement. 1) I stopped with the cat-rape the first time you got this level of pissed-off. 2) 'Little jokes'? Seriously, the last time we purposefully decided to piss you off was... never. 3) People die. It's an occupational hazard of life. Hundreds of thousands of people die every day. One of my parents has died. Get over it. 4) They're hardly puns.
<Yahoo> Please, someone answer my question?

<DragonFireOKN> 2Yep
<A_Guy> 12Aicebo, you just missed me sharing the news that they removed the audio from U Can't Touch This...
<Dragon_protector_x> 2Hi Aicebo
<Aicebo> 13Spyrorocks: I like the extra toolbar thing
<DDR> .___.
<A_Guy> 12Happy birthday, DDR.
<Aicebo> 13A_Guy: DDDD:
<DDR> Thanks
<DragonFireOKN> 2Curse myself for being born Feb. 7th. :(
<DDR> :)
<Dragon_protector_x> 2OHHH!!!!!! I need that tool bar thingy!
<A_Guy> 12Youtube hates me...
<Dragon_protector_x> 2How does i gets it?
<Aicebo> 13Youtube hates me too
<DDR> It hates me too, Aicebo
<DDR> You aren;'t alone
<DDR> XD
<A_Guy> 12It's just like how I was untouched by the recession... until Circuit City closed down...
<Aicebo> 13Dragon_protector_x: SR has the link somewhere
<A_Guy> 12prince-dari made the worst photoshop of me...
<prince-dari> Dragon_protector_x: http://spyroforum.toolbar.fm/
<Aicebo> 13Spyrorocks: Maybe you should make an announcement about the new toolbar
<Spyrorocks> Its not ready yet
<Spyrorocks> its beta
<prince-dari> AHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAAHAHA
<Spyrorocks> Aicebo: Do you like it?
<prince-dari> A_Bush
<prince-dari> HAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAa
<prince-dari> MWAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<prince-dari> H
<prince-dari> I'm done.

<Aicebo> 13"I'm lovin it" =P
<prince-dari> Eurgh
<prince-dari> Mcdonalds.
<Aicebo> 13XD
<DDR> What's the toolbar thing about?
<prince-dari> Spyrorocks: The only thing is, is that a lot of people associate toolbars with adware.
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, I should shove it full of ads.
<prince-dari> I will never forget their advert.
<prince-dari> "Now made with real chicken breast!"
<prince-dari> Creepy.
<Terminator> won't teh explodfing hurt?
<Terminator> grrr -f
<prince-dari> Yes, it will.
<A_Guy> 12I don't associate toolbars with adware, but then again, I only voluntarily installed a toolbar twice.
<prince-dari> I never install toolbars. Unless I have to.
<Spyrorocks> My toolbar is actually useful and not annoying.
<prince-dari> Well, with the exception of SR's toolbar. :P
<dragon_protector_x> YAY!!!!!
<Aicebo> 13There's one thing I'm not sure about the toolbar
<Aicebo> 13Is that it puts rrandom sentences from webpages into the search thing
<Kjakings> 7CAEK
<Spyrorocks> What?
<Aicebo> 13the search part of it
<prince-dari> Aicebo: When you highlight something it copies it into the search thing.
<Aicebo> 13Oh
<Spyrorocks> Yeah
<prince-dari> :P
<DDR> What toolbar?
<prince-dari> I think it's useful.
<Kjakings> 7What's the record for most SC users online at one point? Wasn't it like 21 or something? We should try for 30 at one point, just for the hell of it.
*DDR is lost
<Aicebo> 13That's different
<Aicebo> 13It's cool though
<Aicebo> 13Thanks
<prince-dari> I think it's useful, because otherwise you have to copy-paste. :/
<prince-dari> DDR: http://spyroforum.toolbar.fm/
<Aicebo> 13it's also easier for seeing new posts quickly :D
<Spyrorocks> I could build in spyrochat into the toolbar
<Spyrorocks> The posts thing is really useful.
<prince-dari> LOL ^ That sounds cool.
<Spyrorocks> I actually hate toolbars
<Spyrorocks> but I use my own because I built it in a way that I wouldn't mind it.
<prince-dari> Well most aren't useful.
*DragonFireOKN 2spins DDR around and puts a bandanna over his eyes
<DDR> ...wow, it actually let me download it
*DDR can't see a thing
*prince-dari pushes DDR off a cliff.

<RedDragonX> 4If you are older then me then he can talk lol
<Catabatus> 10Eh, I just like to be literal

<Ignitus232> 6i asked him a question if he were to be Hunter of anything,and he said he is
<Hail> 12Also, he could be lying about his age, and RaidonMakato is probably older than everyone.

<N30N> If more Crocodiles are aware of your exodus I'll have to send in paratroopers to defend you. Secure the package in Albequrque and all will be well, they'll keep you safe until the Corocodiles come for you. Listen closely, this next part is very important: They're going to take you."

<prince-dari> To burn him on a funeral pyre made of a special type of wood called ceritomen, which is only located in one place, and is guarded by death-bringers.
<Edina> The mushroom man is telling me to...the voices are telling me to...to...
<prince-dari> Also they must be sprayed with sieser oil.

<Terminator> 55 seconds
<prince-dari> Which comes from the sieser olive, located only on the top of mount everest, in select locations.
<prince-dari> Then you must light it using a sprig from a coarse hathberry bush.
<prince-dari> Which is found only on mars.
<Edina> The voices are telling me to destroy the sieser olive
<prince-dari> Just crush it, the oil will come out.

<Aicebo> 13lol
<Things> Spyrorocks, i'm trying to remember my login detailz :P
<prince-dari> You know that guy, on the wolf thread, who said that wolves don't kill for no reason?
<prince-dari> That they only do it when they're hungry?
<prince-dari> In a three week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten.[2]
<Aicebo> 13http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-6726-do-you-have-a-boyfriend-girlfriend-and-relationships-discussion-in-general.html?start=345 LOL @ the third post down
<Spyrorocks> wolfs killed my mother for no reason.
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari: LOL
<prince-dari> I'm gunna go post that.
<prince-dari> Where's the thread?
<Things> i ate it
<Aicebo> 13Spyro Master probably pushed it to another page
<prince-dari> Nuuuuuuuuuuu
<Aicebo> 13-____-
<Things> Spyrorocks, approved
<Aicebo> 13weee
<Aicebo> 13bored...
<prince-dari> Oh, and it gets worse, about the wolves thing.
<prince-dari> Since the late 1990s, there have been several cases of many Caspian seals dying due to canine distemper virus.
<prince-dari> It caused thousands of them to die years afterwards too.
<prince-dari> Looooool.
<Aicebo> 13Wow.
<Things> Man since I started drinking this energy drink, like 5 mins ago, i've been like continously releasing bad gas ..
<Things> >.>
<Aicebo> 13That's sad, but it's funny that we proved him wrong
<Aicebo> 13Someone watched too many anime wolf/dog shizz.
<Spyrorocks> MrBot: Do you like wolves?
<prince-dari> A century ago there were an estimated 1.5 million seals; by the 1980s, there were about 400,000.
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> Wow.
<MrBot> Yes.
<prince-dari> ^NUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Spyrorocks> MrBot: No you do not like wolves.
<MrBot> You're right.
<prince-dari> o_O
<Spyrorocks> MrBot: I am always right.
<MrBot> How can you be so sure?
<Aicebo> 13"bull ****. Humans are more of an animals than wolves are. Wolves know how to act. Humans are the barbaric blood thirsty killers." AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Aicebo> 13I think I just died for a second

<Aicebo> 13Ahaha.
<Aicebo> 13I'd like to see these kids spend ONE DAY as a wolf. Out in the cold, danger of being hunted, having to catch your own food and eat the meat without cooking it

<Brazilian_Spyro> I got proof that she IS liying about her age
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Show me proof
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Or I will set pedo bear on you.
<Kjakings> 7I've got proof. You only need to read ANY post of hers to see she's in the nine/ten/eleven agegroup.
<Brazilian_Spyro> Search for the member HanliSmith123 on spyroforums, and then look at spyroli
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: >>
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> And if the proof is inadequate, pedo bear will still be sent after you
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: You're the exception of the rule, you know that.
<Brazilian_Spyro> the two members have diferent birthdates
<Aicebo> 13She could've just put random ones, you know :P
<Aicebo> 13Jesus.
<Kjakings> 7Brazilian_Spyro: And? I accidently set my age to fourteen when I joined. It could be a mistake, I've corrected it now though.
<Brazilian_Spyro> That's why she is lying about her age(s)
<Aicebo> 13That's not proof.
<Brazilian_Spyro> Oh holy crap, hack into her PC and see what I saw to believe what I say
<Kjakings> 7And how exactly do we hack into her PC?
<Kjakings> 7Walk us through it, step by step.
<Brazilian_Spyro> Is someone here moderator of spyroforums? (if they can see Ips)
<Aicebo> 13I am :P But no I'm not hacking.
<Kjakings> 7Get the IP, and dari will do it,.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> You can't hack someone with an IP address...
<Brazilian_Spyro> You could use her IP adress to find her PC
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> No you can't
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> You talk BS.
<Brazilian_Spyro> I did hack into her PC
<Kjakings> 7IPs are useless. Even I know that.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> With her IP address, you could find approximately where she lives.
<Aicebo> 13yalp
<Aicebo> 13Nope
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Or send packets to it, on ports.
<Aicebo> 13You're lucky enough to find a city with an IP
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Although antivirus usually blocks random packets.
<Brazilian_Spyro> There is a program called VNCViewer
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Doesn't work ^
<Brazilian_Spyro> I said to her to download it
<Brazilian_Spyro> Then I could see what is inside her PC
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> So you put a keylogger on her computer...?
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Or a trojan?
<Brazilian_Spyro> Not exactly
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Yes exactly.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> A trojan gathers information from the victim.
<Brazilian_Spyro> I just could navigat into her PC with her knowing that, but she didn't know what I was seeing
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Well most trojans.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Why would she let you?
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> You talk crap too much.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Kick please, Aicebo?
<Aicebo> 13So, if you "knew all along" why didn't you stop being a flirt or whatever with her? Jesus kid
<Terminat0r> Assume the position%#%^@@$#~@@##$
<Brazilian_Spyro> Because she is a fool, and fell on my trap
<Brazilian_Spyro> Because I'll get all the information out of her this way
<Brazilian_Spyro> I'm pretending to fall on her trap
<Brazilian_Spyro> Okay, I've said what I had to say, that's it. That's All
<Aicebo> 13FREAKYBOY
<Aicebo> 13*FREAKBOY
<Kjakings> 7Please ban him. If you need a reason, he's upsetting the spyrochat community with all his freaky paedophillic BS with his nine year old girlfriend.
<Aicebo> 13XD
<Aicebo> 13Oh, did I say nine? I meant eight.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Aicebo> 13He sounds like some thirteen year old boy trying to sound cool after being embarrased about his 8 year old "gf"
<Aicebo> 13On dS he asked me if I was "Envious" of the picture of his "gf" because I didn't believe her
<Aicebo> 13Ahaha
<Terminat0r> DESTRUCTION IS NICE@~!!$$$

<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: Didn't Nigel cheat on you or something? (I accidently typo'd 'on' to be om lol.))

<Kjakings> 7Oh look... Yahoo's fucked off again, like she always does when you ask her a direct question she doesn't like.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Hmm
<Rurik> 4huh?
<wyndon_torque> O___O
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> I think Yahoo only does it to you, Kjakings.
<Kjakings> 7So do I.
<Kjakings> 7I may have to kill her.
<Rurik> 4LOL
<Yahoo> Sorry, dad wanted me to sort out the telly
<Rurik> 4LIES

<Kjakings> 7Really? Because I'm seeing a trend.
<Yahoo> And I'm not going to make a song and dance about it like the Cyprus
<Kjakings> 7Aah, there we go. Phase 2, attempting to change the subject.
<Kjakings> 7Now we revert back to ignoring.
<Yahoo> Well sorry, I've been on the sims 2 all day and I need to check dA

<Terminat0r> french fries of course!
<Kjakings> 7Now to excuses.

<Kjakings> 7Didn't Nigel cheat on you and you got pissy about it, avoiding direct questions (much like now) about it, much like Ayumi?
<Rurik> 4Dun dun dun...
<Yahoo> 20:01 Kjakings Didn't Nigel cheat on you and you got pissy about it, avoiding direct questions (much like now) about it, much like Ayumi? Lol, true, but I am going to try again
<Kjakings> 7Much like Ayumi.
<Kjakings> 7You're either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid.
<Kjakings> 7Or a mix.
<Yahoo> Oh come on, some americans are push overs (sorry to any americans here)
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, stupid.
<Rurik> 4Good thing I am not a native
<wyndon_torque> LOL! I'm a Texan. The worst kind of american XDDDD
<Yahoo> One question I have asked Nigel about is that, out of all the places in England and even Kent, why Lydd? Pikey Ville, Drug up high and chav haven
<wyndon_torque> Internet relaTIONSHIP?
<Yahoo> Nooo
<Yahoo> Nigel lives in my Villiage
<wyndon_torque> Ah
<Yahoo> He came to my school in year 3
<wyndon_torque> But KJA said he dared Ayumi
<wyndon_torque> dated or something like that
<Yahoo> LOL
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: In science today, we determined that London is the home of chavs (Abbey is my proof), Essex is the home of tarts (because it is) and Kent is the home of Pikeys (look at Yahoo).
<Yahoo> Yeah, you are right Kieran
<Kjakings> 7Wow, Wyndon is stupid.

<Kjakings> 7Get the freaking email.
<Yahoo> I'll look on the HPRP Forum
<Kjakings> 7... It's not that Aimee prick is it?
<Kjakings> 7Or Sharon or whatever her name is.
<Yahoo> She has many many many emails
<Yahoo> Aimee is so mucbh like you but you just sound like me
<Yahoo> Her personality and my voice o_O
<Kjakings> 7That didn't answer my question. At all.
<Kjakings> 7That didn't answer my question. At all.
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> It is aimee
<Yahoo> She's awesome but she did throw me at a radiator
<Kjakings> 7Quick question, does calling her 'Amy' annoy her? Because I can just do that constantly in every email.
<Yahoo> Wait, no, that was charlotte
<Kjakings> 7On top of everything else.
<Yahoo> No, she likes to be called Amy
<Kjakings> 7Fuck
<Kjakings> 7What is her actual name?
<Yahoo> Aimee (First e with accent)

<Yahoo> é thast you
<Yahoo> *Thank you
<Kjakings> 7It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:<
<wyndon_torque> Holy fuc, you guys! Curious George is on!!!
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> It took 3 hours to look that up...?
<Yahoo> D=
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Wow.
<Yahoo> YAAAAAAAAAAAY
<Kjakings> 7Not literally three hours.
<Kjakings> 7Twat
<Kjakings> 7Considering each lesson is only 50 minutes too.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Don't exaggerate then.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> :)
<wyndon_torque> It's not nice to call someone that, KJA
<Kjakings> 7Don't be a literal fagballs then.
<Yahoo> It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:< That is why I am taking spanish for modern languages
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> What does that have to do with anything?
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Stay on topic Kjakings, the topic is you exaggerating.
<Kjakings> 7On topic? It's not a forum idiot.
<Yahoo> It's about french lol
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> LAWL, why do you think there is a topic command?
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> You have topics.
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: Actually, it's about alt codes, or annoying your friend.... GET THE EMAIL.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Idiot.
<Yahoo> I have one way to annoy her
<Kjakings> 7... I'm done talking to you.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Because I win?
<Yahoo> Mua mua mua muaahahahhahahahah
<Terminat0r> You lie... YOU LIEEEEEEE^~~!%^@#^$*~!%*
<Kjakings> 7No, because you're being a prick.
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: Tell me, then give me everything you have on her.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Actually, you are being the prick, I am stating that you are an idiot.
<Terminat0r> you can tell the point at which he comes by the deepening shade of purple
<Yahoo> wyndon_torque: Ignore him
<Kjakings> 7I'm opening up a new space in my files now.
<Kjakings> 7MrBot: Are your colours fixed?
<Yahoo> http://www.mibbit.com/up/oU4oJ8yP.jpg
<Yahoo> Dunt click that
<Yahoo> I was seeing what it was
<Kjakings> 7....
<Kjakings> 7If you're going to ignore everything I say on the subject Yahoo, I'm not going to help.
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<Yahoo> http://www.mibbit.com/up/Fy4ZfiAB.swf ???????
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Kjakings: You also need to add to your response list, at the moment you have only about...4 different repsonse.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Anyway.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> I'll be back alter.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> later*
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Cya
<Yahoo> Ooooh, Kieran, don't worry any more
<wyndon_torque> You know, this would be one of those things thats best done in PMs
<Kjakings> 7Wyndon: We humbly apologise for talking in a chat room your majesty. I will ask the guard captain to administer the 40 lashes.
<wyndon_torque> Check your myspace inbox, Aicebo
*Spyrorocks administers 40 lashes
<wyndon_torque> XD
<Kjakings> 7... I hate you sometimes SR lol. But I bet you get that a lot. ^^
<Kjakings> 7And how are you the guard captain?
<wyndon_torque> I bet everyone hates you ALL the time, KJA
<Yahoo> http://www.mibbit.com/up/lfpsNM8i.swf ....is this wrking?
<Kjakings> 7Wouldn't you be like, the Head General or something?
<Yahoo> *working
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> I'm still trying to work out why everyone thinks Kjakings is female.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> I can't see him being female really.
<Spyrorocks> Yahoo: Yes it works
<wyndon_torque> Because he has eternal PMS
<Kjakings> 7I swear to God if I see that intro once more I'm going to kill someone.
<Yahoo> Thank you
<Spyrorocks> Looks cool too
<Yahoo> Thanks :)
<Yahoo> I prefere it with music
<Spyrorocks> Im no good at flash, I can just do basic stuff in KoolMoves
<Yahoo> I would show you the one with music but it is annoyingly slow
<Spyrorocks> that font is really hard to read though
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Yeah ^
<Yahoo> Yeah, it doesn't even have any punctuation
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> So change the font to something more readable? O_o
<Spyrorocks> I would recommend for the text animations, you do a soft fade in, wait, blink to white, then dissappear.
<Spyrorocks> but thats just me, I think it gives a little more "edge" to it.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Or you could make a "next" button, so it the animation continues when you want it to.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Then you don't have to watch it 3 times trying to read the text.
<Spyrorocks> Its an intro, it doesnt need a next button
<Spyrorocks> just make the font more readable and maybe consider a different text animation style
<Yahoo> http://www.deviantart.com/download/111025270/CaS__CoTL_PREVIEW_WIP_by_YahootheDragon.swf Takes a while to load with the music
<Spyrorocks> A mistake thats made is playing music with lyrics other than whats displayed on screen
<wyndon_torque> It's nice. I have flash, but I've never actually made anything with it.
<Spyrorocks> Maybe throw in some lighting bolts and a pirate flag.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> O_o? ^
<Spyrorocks> lightning*
<wyndon_torque> I also love that song
<Kjakings> 7Pirate flag?
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> ......maulteasers
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Yahoo: Also, preloaders FTW. :P
<Yahoo> ..brb
<wyndon_torque> Wow! That was awesome, Yahoo
<Yahoo> I am looking for a tutorial for a preloader, it's just a pain when flash iss sucky on Vista
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> ...
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> One sec.
<Spyrorocks> I displays fine in XP
<Spyrorocks> It*
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> I have a preloader file somewhere. O_o
<Spyrorocks> firefox on XP is all good with your flash
<Spyrorocks> Not slow at all.
<Yahoo> So that is another reason why IE is crap
<Spyrorocks> I wouldn't blame IE
<Spyrorocks> I think its just flash
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> mcname._xscale=(_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100;
<Spyrorocks> it comes down to the speed of your pc because flash does take CPU to process.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> That's for a bar ^
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> And
<Yahoo> I had to introduce my teacher to flash kit lol
<Spyrorocks> You should use a round function because you can't have half pixels.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> If you want text under it, with percentage loaded
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> textname.text=Math.round((_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100)+"%";
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Then to stop it leaving that frame, unless it's loaded
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> if (_root.getBytesTotal() != _root.getBytesLoaded()){
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> gotoAndPlay(1);
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> }
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> That's it.
<Yahoo> ...wow
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Spyrorocks: Can you do -N, so I can change my nick back please? I can't be bothered to leave. :P
<Yahoo> ...is that dari lol
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Yep.
<Yahoo> I should of guessed
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Yes, you should have.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> :P

<wyndon_torque> XD If they ask how old you are it is XD
<Aicebo> 13Are you guys talking through YT, or something else

<Hail> 12
<Kjakings> 7As I said, I'm too tired for this, so I'm not going to bother this time.
<Kjakings> 7Terminator, activate the rickroll device!
<Terminat0r> the rickroll device! engaged###@%#
<Kjakings> 7... I so did not expect that to work.
<wyndon_torque> Look, wheather it's true or not it's real, what's the harm in a little internet-sympathy?
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Kjakings: LOL
<Hail> 12oh no..

<Spyrorocks> My dad's friend died when he was 14. Want the story?
<Hail> 12V I'll type what happen..
<Hail> 12nvm
<Hail> 12sure sr...
<RedDragonX> 4I'm sure that several of us have stories about death
<Rurik> 4My twin died. I can type the story
<Hail> 12sure...
<Hail> 12I have a real story...
<Hail> 12about my mom's aunt's death :(
<Hail> 12She, died of cancer..
<wyndon_torque> I lost my real mom when I was six
<Spyrorocks> Well, there was this guy in my dad's neighbourhood.
<Spyrorocks> He was always good with kids
<Hail> 12she couldnt even open her eyes or talk ....my moms aunt died of cancer
<Spyrorocks> had barbicues etc etc
<Spyrorocks> So one day my dad's friend is outside, and he calls him inside his house for whatever reason
<Kjakings> 7Oh jesus, I can't deal with this. I'm just going to go and type up an intro in this RP, someone call me when the death-fest is over.
<Spyrorocks> strangles him and kills him.
<Rurik> 4Which one?
<Spyrorocks> No reason at all.
<Hail> 12What!
<Hail> 12That doesn't make sense...
<Spyrorocks> Yep
<Spyrorocks> It doesn't
<Hail> 12Why would he do thatd?
<Hail> 12*that
<Spyrorocks> But if your killing people like that in the first place, its not going to make sense.
<Spyrorocks> Don't know.
<Why-Is-Nmode-Off> Hail: It's called being clinically insane.
<Spyrorocks> The guy is either dead or in jail today.
<Spyrorocks> that was like 28 ish years ago.
<wyndon_torque> It's okay, Hail.
<Spyrorocks> Then theres the story about my dad's other friend who liked to hit .22 shells on the top with a hammer in his basement
<Hail> 12Thanks wyndon.

<prince-dari> Well I can make the page automatically refresh every 3 seconds.
<prince-dari> So you just have to worry about clicking it
<Kjakings> 7Refreshing isn't the problem, my clicking speed is.
<prince-dari> Hm
<prince-dari> What's the description of the valentines egg?
<Kjakings> 7Erm... hold on
<Kjakings> 7This egg is speckled and very fragile.
<Kjakings> 7The limit is two
<prince-dari> How long before new eggs come on it?
<Kjakings> 7Erm, there are three eggs every five minutes and a big drop every hour. But with the abandoned page blocking the cave entrance you sometimes get a backlog, which is getting bigger now that the Valnetines eggs, as well as frilled, have come into it.
<prince-dari> So willl the valentines eggs come every hour?
<Kjakings> 7There's a chance they'll also come at the five minute drops or several times during a release of the backlog.
<prince-dari> backlog...?
<Kjakings> 7Yes. If the eggs in the abandoned page get to a certain number then it blocks up the caveborn eggs, stopping anyone from picking them up. These eggs don't evaporate, just stay there, building up, so when the abandoned page has a few less and it's NOT blocked the cave entrance, then all the built up eggs can be picked up. But only in threes.

<Yahoo> Yay
<Kjakings> 7Hey Yahoo, will you take a DC egg instead of gems?
<Icydragon> 12Hay.
<Yahoo> Sure
<Kjakings> 7The rarest I can breed is a silver.
<Kjakings> 7If you wait I'll be able to breed you some frilled.
<PARANOiA> 3Anyone got a Valentine's dragon yet?
<Kjakings> 7No, I want one!
<Kjakings> 7I'm obsessing.
<PARANOiA> 3Yeah, I just realized that they existed
<Kjakings> 7LOL
<PARANOiA> 3Were they available yesterday too?
<Kjakings> 7They may only be on today, although there's some speculation that they're here to stay since not every egg is one.
<PARANOiA> 3Hmm
<PARANOiA> 3Btw what's a frilled?
<Yahoo> PAHAHAHA RURIK XD
<PARANOiA> 3If you wait I'll be able to breed you some frilled.
<Yahoo> I saw your post on the Cyril fan club
<Kjakings> 7A frilled is one of the two new DC species, not counting the holiday valentines.
<Yahoo> Cynder794 really needed that

<prince-dari> But as my actual first name is Darius, Darius has gone to Orange
<prince-dari> It doesn't matter where Orange was derrived from.
<Deathbat> 10Stacey has gone to T Mobile.
<Deathbat> 10SIMPLES?
<Neon> Orange is a town...
<Deathbat> 10So is Kerang

*Catabatus 14watches as the badgers hit the ground and explode in slow motion
<prince-dari> Or Sir Amik Varze
<prince-dari> Or Sir Tiffy Casian
<Neon> You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!
<Neon> The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well-known is this: never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...
<prince-dari> If you can't work those out, Sir Amik Varze = Ceramic vase.

<prince-dari> Servile
<Neon> never heard it.
<Spyrorocks> Dev-CPP: There must be something terribly wrong with your code. Please fix it.
<Kjakings> 7What I never got was why people always said "Circumfrence of a circle." Surely, if circumfrence is only used when talking about the perimeter of a circle, then the qualifier "of a circle" is unnecessary.
<Catabatus> 14Sir Val
<Neon> Sir Ena

<prince-dari> Only n00bs don't.
<prince-dari> Kjakings: Who are Bob and George?
<Catabatus> 14But, uh... was Hail one of those n00bs
<Neon> Same.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: That comci thing.
<prince-dari> Wow, I can't believe Hail believed that.
<prince-dari> Of course I was talking about her.
<prince-dari> O_o
<Neon> Hail is a sand castle.
<Neon> :P
*Ryft is getting tired of these people...farewell
<Neon> Bye.
<Neon> :)
<prince-dari> Kjakings: If I've never seen that joke from them, I didn't steal it from them
<prince-dari> I just thought it up now.
<prince-dari> Because it's obvious.
<Catabatus> 14Hail is slow
<Kjakings> 7Dari: http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/0210/021019.png
<Neon> I've seen Master Bates in several sources.
<Neon> He is a user on a forum i'm on.

<Terminator> ARRRRGH!!! I had a horrible nightmare of a hundred thousand demons speedily flying over each other T_T.
<Neon> "One day they'll have secrets... one day they'll have dreams." -iRobot
<Neon> XD
<prince-dari> LOL
<Neon> That movie has the best quotes evar.
<prince-dari> Yeah, like "Atchoo, sorry, I'm alergic to bullshit"
<Neon> Haha yeah.
<Neon> Plus the following:
<Neon> "My logic is undeniable"
<prince-dari> That comes from iRobot?
<prince-dari> :)
<prince-dari> :0*
<Terminator> :o)
<Neon> "I'm sorry: ou're a cat, I'm black... I just don't wanna get hurt again."
<Neon> *you're
<Kjakings> 7 21:16	prince-dari	Yeah, like "Atchoo, sorry, I'm alergic to bullshit" So THAT'S where I supposedly stole that joke from. I never saw it, so I obviously never stole it. 21:11	prince-dari	Kjakings: If I've never seen that joke from them, I didn't steal it from them
<prince-dari> You must have heard it from someone who stole it from there then.
<Catabatus> 14._.
<Neon> "You are experiencing a car accident." ":The hell I am!"
<prince-dari> LOL ^
<prince-dari> I love that quote
<Neon> Me too.

<Neon> " I seriously doubt we have 6 minutes..."
<RedDragonX> 4good movie
<prince-dari> Yes.
<prince-dari> Very Good.
<Neon> Yup.
<prince-dari> And Kjakings doesn't like it (Or won't watch it), because it has Will Smith in it.
<RedDragonX> 4what a surprise lol
<RedDragonX> 4I think I'm gonna throw some DBZ on
<Neon> I like how in the end Sonny saves Calvin, ultimately proving he was very different than most robots (compared the robot that saved Spooner rather than the young girl underwater).
<RedDragonX> 4and yes Neon that is pretty good
<Neon> The same situation repeated itself, which was kewl.
<Kjakings> 7The only thing I will go out and watch that has Will Smith in it without it looking like an 11/10 on the pwn meter (which, admittedly, iRobot does, I just cba to go watch it) is the Fresh Prince of Bellair. Because it's awesome.
<Catabatus> 14Wah
<Catabatus> 10Wait, teal isn't taken anymore
<Kjakings> 7Lol

<Neon> Maybe an Arquillian laid eggs in yor head. D:
<Catabatus> 10...
<Catabatus> 10Neon
<Catabatus> 10I am going to forget you said that
<Neon> Speaking of Arquillians, who liked Men In Black?
<Neon> ^ Why?
<Neon> :P
<Catabatus> 10And we shall never speak of this again.

<Yahoo> HOLY CRAP STACEY POSTED ON SF

<Neon> II was pwnage though... but alright.
<Neon> The first was just so full of nonsense/life enigmas, which was what I loved.

<Catabatus> 10Nausea! Heartburn! Indigestion! Upset stomach... Diarrhea!
<Neon> Headache Naseua Indigestion! Heartburn
<Neon> No you beat me!
<Neon> XD
<prince-dari> Walmart is better than Tesco
<prince-dari> Terminator: Walmart is better than Tesco
<Neon> Tesco hasn't gotten to (infected) my area yet.
<prince-dari> Walmart is the infection, Tesco rules.
<prince-dari> M&S FTW though.
*Terminator has a tremendous failure :(
<Terminator> I "smell" of east.
<Catabatus> 10Target!
<prince-dari> Terminator FTF
<prince-dari> I made a trade with my sister.
<prince-dari> She has to read Eragon, and I have to read Twilight.
<Catabatus> 10You poor, poor thing
<Kjakings> 7That's hardly a fair trade on your part.
*Catabatus 10sniffs loudly and pats prince-dari on the back
<RedDragonX> 4seriously
<prince-dari> Meh, it's so boring.
<prince-dari> Someone finally died at the end of the first one though.
<Kjakings> 7Eragon is an epic rip-off of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and it's so awesome it manages to pull it off without anyone caring.
<prince-dari> ^ Yeah.
<Catabatus> 10Agreed
<prince-dari> And oh God, the second twilight book.
<prince-dari> It's terrible.
<prince-dari> All the vampires leave and it gets even more mundane than normal.
<RedDragonX> 4havn't read a single one of them
<prince-dari> All it is is some girl crying.
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari: Haha I know
<Catabatus> 10Head-On, apply directly to the forehead!
<prince-dari> *Cry, cry, keep crying, cry more*
<Knee-On> What're we talkin' about?

<Aicebo> 13"Dear Coryn, YOU SUCK. Love, Aicebo"
<prince-dari> Wow Americans randomly attack people and don't even get put on trial.
<prince-dari> Some people in the airforce went joy-riding in an aircraft, and destroyed a ski-lift in Italy, and killed loads of people.
<prince-dari> Didn't get put on trial, didn't even get kicked out of the airforce.
<Catabatus> 10.....

<Yahoo> Hi
<Aicebo> 13I found a new video site, but I only just discovered it and have to look around
<Yahoo> Okay, what is it called?
<Aicebo> 13http://bestonvideo.com
<Aicebo> 13I'm currently looking around
<Aicebo> 13Just registered.
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> YT logo style
<Yahoo> Its a very small site isnt it
<Yahoo> Just registered
<Aicebo> 13Every site is small at first xP
<Aicebo> 13I guess it means MOAR VIEWS :P
<Yahoo> I know
<Yahoo> XD
<Yahoo> I hope YT doesnt catch it
<Yahoo> What's your name on there?
<Yahoo> Aicebo
<Aicebo> 13Mikehsaur
<Yahoo> Lol
<Yahoo> Invite for friend sent :)
<Aicebo> 13If you notice there's lots of Club Penguin/Runescape crap....and AMVs so this looks like a place that lots of AMV people are going to :D
<Yahoo> Current Position: 189 / 4469 KBytes At least it gives you the position
<Yahoo> This is so much quicker than yt
<Yahoo> I guess they have too many videos on YT
<Yahoo> Hang on, have you uploaded a video yet?
<Aicebo> 13I'm uploading now.
<Yahoo> It has that processing thing
<Yahoo> Approval WTH?!
<Aicebo> 13Oh, you need to wait for approval?
<Yahoo> Yeah
<Aicebo> 13ClipUpload does that. No worries.
<Aicebo> 13They just want to make sure that there's nothing bad in the video or something...
<Yahoo> Oh ok
<Yahoo> You have (1) videos awaiting approval [note: only approved videos show on the list]
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Yahoo> How long do you think it will take?
<Terminator> Bob.
<Aicebo> 13Not sure. It's different for every site.
<Aicebo> 13Crap this thing is awesome
<Aicebo> 13It's fun just to watch it speed around while it uploads XD

*Yahoo highfives
<Yahoo> Let's show em what we can do
<Yahoo> I'll try making videos again once I have got this bloody preview done

<Kjakings> 7Stupid revision. I'm allowed on, put only because of YT as my excuse =/
<Zephyr-kun> Hmm, cool
<Yahoo> Thanks :)
<Zephyr-kun> By the way, Aicebo, you have Spyro clips? Whenever I look I either get something that won't work on WMM or the files all jacked up, that or they aren't even there
<Aicebo> 13hm.
<Aicebo> 13Where do you get your clips?
<Aicebo> 13Like, what site.
<Zephyr-kun> Depends. I got a few off of Youtube, and those were broken. I think I got the EN ones from Megaupload, but they aren't there anymore
<Aicebo> 13You need to get them from FileFront.
<Aicebo> 13I'll give you some links.
<Aicebo> 13As far as I know they're the only decent ones.
<Aicebo> 13http://hosted.filefront.com/MasterBlui <-- TEN and DOTD clips. A couple are ANB clips.

<spyro_master> 6oh gotcha
<Aicebo> 13It's not about which ones you reply to, but how many.
<spyro_master> 6well i wnat to reply to them thats all

<Aicebo> 13There's lots of members that come here, and specific ones that you met the first time won't always be around
<Aicebo> 13It's so funny when people ask those kinds of question while making me angry at the same time, IDK.
<spyro_master> 6lol sorry it was rhetorical anyway
<Kjakings> 7Spyro_Master: What you're seeing here is a rare *COUGH*frequent*COUGH* occurance. Aicebo gets pissy over nothing, and suddenly claims everyone's out to get her/trying to piss her off/something similar. She then refuses to listen to all reason and completely ignores what everyone says and just assumes it's an insult in Phase 3. Then she just starts randomly abusing power and kicking in Phase 4. Although Phases 3 and 4 generally never happ
<Kjakings> 7Wow bet that got cut off
<spyro_master> 6No it didnt

<spyro_master> 6i didnt notice
<spyro_master> 6XD
<Kjakings> 7Although Phases 3 and 4 generally never happen, I've been in the heart of several of them.
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: Not ALWAYS.
<spyro_master> 6harlol
<Aicebo> 13Not to C7
<spyro_master> 6what does C7 mean?
<Aicebo> 13She's a member.
<Aicebo> 13:/
<spyro_master> 6ok lol
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: And you're not stressy to Edina.
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: I'm not stressy to a lot of people :P
<Aicebo> 13Anyways....weeee.

<spyro_master> 6good lol
<Aicebo> 13You know, if you continue to do this, not just now but later on with other members I will give you a temp ban. You're doing this on purpose.
<Kjakings> 7When ecactly have I done this to other members? I know of no-one who's liek you... except maybe Hail. But we've established that little fagballs copies everyone.
<Aicebo> 13Hail is so str*ight.
<Aicebo> 13>>
<Kjakings> 7LOL
<Kjakings> 7That was a win.
<Aicebo> 13Some kid on SF censored the word "gay"
<Aicebo> 13I'm not going to censor "str*ight"
<Aicebo> 13*Now
<Aicebo> 13Not not
<Aicebo> 13xP

<Stormy> What is it?
<Aicebo> 13They're like the LBT parodies.
<Stormy> It's not loading... internet's slow
<Aicebo> 13Only for Dragon Tales
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Stormy> Oh
<Stormy> I see
<Aicebo> 13the one I posted they featured pokemon xP ahaha
<Terminator> more power... give me MORE POWER@##^%#$~#
<Stormy> =/
<Kjakings> 7Stormy, before SR will even look at my argument for restoring posting ability for RPs I've gotta run it through you. I didn't wanna pick on DDR and I wasn't sure whether Aicebo was in his elite council of doom.
<Kjakings> 7... Hold on.. Buggering eyelashes...
<Stormy> lolwut?
<Stormy> What are you on about?
<Stormy> o__o
<Aicebo> 13^same
<Kjakings> 7I got an eyelash in my eye and it was being more annoying ththat stupid flickering light behind me...
<Kjakings> 7thank that*
<Kjakings> 7than that**
<Aicebo> 13I don't really care about the posts for RPGs. I don't really watch that section....
<Kjakings> 7Meh.
<Stormy> It's kind of a useless section
<Stormy> It's more spam than anything
<Spyro_fan55> heylo
<Aicebo> 13hi
<Kjakings> 7Right, but if you got someone in there just to whip the little buggers into shape and put up an approval system like.... hold on...
<Stormy> Approval system?
<Kjakings> 7http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=1486 <-- This one, then it'll be better. That's like saying you should close down the art section because of bad art or the FF section because of people's bad writing skills.
<Stormy> No one's saying to close it down
<Kjakings> 7Not close down
<Kjakings> 7Sorry
<Stormy> I just don't think five-second posts like the ones that go in there need to count towards post count
<Stormy> It's a game section
<prince-dari> Who called me about an hour ago?
<Kjakings> 7I don't know why I bother talking to you people anymore <_<

<prince-dari> Nah, just Kjakings.
<RedDragonX> 4oh. Well that's ordinary

<Aicebo> 13Vegitarian food = ew.
<prince-dari> /notice Aicebo He think he is a vegitarian dragon? LOL
<Aicebo> 13I don't know how people can't eat meat.
<RedDragonX> 4I second that
<prince-dari> /notice Aicebo "What do you think dragons eat?" "Uhhh...Leaves?"
<Blaze> 4Aicebo: you = ew(wow that was a really bbad burn by me)
<prince-dari> The only meat I couldn't live without would be bacon and sausages, and definitely fish, if you count that as meat.
<RedDragonX> 4wow that was really...dumb
<Blaze> 4i hate hurting animals
<Aicebo> 13HAHAHAHA that was lame.
<RedDragonX> 4oi
<Blaze> 4one min brb AFK!!!
<Aicebo> 13Farm animals are raised to be eaten
<RedDragonX> 4yup
<Aicebo> 13If you don't eat it, someone else will for you
<Aicebo> 13You don't "save" any.
<Aicebo> 13Besides
<RedDragonX> 4it's a good thing he doesn't live about....10,000 years ago lol
<prince-dari> I can't believe people say "Ooooh, BUUURRRNN", that stereotypical American diva phrase.
<Aicebo> 13It's not like they're born and killed right away. They're raised, then slaughtered. Food is food.
<prince-dari> I can't believe people actually say*
<BenevolentFacade> say wha?
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari: XDDDD It's so stupid.
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<RedDragonX> 4eh...who gives a damn
<prince-dari> I R VEGITARIAN DRAGON!!!111!111
<prince-dari> ME EAT TREEZ
<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<Aicebo> 13"Oooh Burn" is such a phrase for immature little children in elementary school.
<prince-dari> I also can't believe that people say "Tres cool"
<BenevolentFacade> Ooh burn
<RedDragonX> 4which is prolly what he is
<prince-dari> It sounds so stupid and dumb blonde.
<Aicebo> 13What's that mean
<Aicebo> 13Ahaha
<prince-dari> "That is just, like, tres cool"
<prince-dari> Tres is very in French
<BenevolentFacade> yeh
<BenevolentFacade> who says that?
<Aicebo> 13That's dumb XD
<BenevolentFacade> i've never heard it
<prince-dari> Stereotypical American blonde (Insert dumb before blonde if you want, but I don't think it's needed)
<BenevolentFacade> really?
<BenevolentFacade> i've been around some blonds and ive never heard that
<prince-dari> Which is why it's stereotypical.
<BenevolentFacade> ?
<BenevolentFacade> explain that
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Google it for a definition.
<Aicebo> 13...
<Aicebo> 13How old are you?"
<BenevolentFacade> why is it stereotypical if ive never heard it from a blond
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<prince-dari> You really don't know what stereotyping is?
<BenevolentFacade> a predetermined judgement for some group of people
<prince-dari> Exactly.
<RedDragonX> 4heheh
<prince-dari> So it doesn't really matter whether the people actually say it or not.
<prince-dari> It may even come from movies.
<RedDragonX> 4it can also be the ultimate shield for people
<prince-dari> But what I'm saying is that I can't believe that people actually say it.
<prince-dari> People have said it on here.
<prince-dari> (Americans)
<prince-dari> :P
<BenevolentFacade> ok then... maybe i missed part of the conversation about this
<RedDragonX> 4one of the reasons why society sucks as usual
<BenevolentFacade> pesimitic hmm
<Aicebo> 13hmmm...
<BenevolentFacade> *pesimistic
<RedDragonX> 4nah I just tell the truth
<Aicebo> 13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<RedDragonX> 4 0.0
<prince-dari> Yeah, I like to think of myself more as a realist, than being pesimistic.
<prince-dari> I don't create illusions.
<RedDragonX> 4I'm a realist by far
<prince-dari> I tell it as it is.
<TornWings> 15............
<RedDragonX> 4problem is
<BenevolentFacade> truth can come half full or empty
<RedDragonX> 4now you can't tell someone these days
<RedDragonX> 4the truth because you will be accused of a vast amount of things
<Aicebo> 13RAWR
<RedDragonX> 4including Stereo typing
*Aicebo 13is insane atm
<prince-dari> One word.
<prince-dari> :P
<RedDragonX> 4I could care less if it is
<prince-dari> I know.
<RedDragonX> 4on here I don't give a shit about my spelling lol
<prince-dari> But I still like to correct people.
<BenevolentFacade> why do people care about spelling if they know what the word is
<RedDragonX> 4ok grammar Nazi
<prince-dari> Yes, I am.
<RedDragonX> 4Only place I care about it is in my stories that's it lol
<BenevolentFacade> as far as im conserned if the message got through then its done its job
<TornWings> 14.
<BenevolentFacade> >:^V
<RedDragonX> 4what's with the dots lol
<TornWings> 14wanted to show I'm here, but I don't have anything to say.
<RedDragonX> 4ah
<prince-dari> <BenevolentFacade> truth can come half full or empty The whole half full/empty thing doesn't really work, because the glass is either more full, or more empty, and it is almost impossible for it to be exactly half. The way you see it doesn't really reflect your view on things, I would just say it to be whether I perceived it to be more full, or more empty, how does that make me pesismitic?
<RedDragonX> 4for crying out loud
<prince-dari> RedDragonX: What?
<Zephyr-kun> 'Ai
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<TornWings> 14prince-dari you're just arguing semantics now
<BenevolentFacade> its about perseption
<Aicebo> 13I'mma brb/bbl
<prince-dari> TornWings: ...So?
<Vail> 6hello guys
<Vail> 6hello guys
<RedDragonX> 4Nothing I just like saying things
<TornWings> 14.
<prince-dari> BenevolentFacade: Yes, but the I perceive it is on facts, not whether I view a possitive or negative view on things.
<prince-dari> the way*
<Zephyr-kun> 6o_o This was a bad time to end up signing on xD
<Vail> 6gtg bye
<BenevolentFacade> thats just being blunt
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<prince-dari> not whether I view it in a possitive, or negative way.*
*Terminator burps
<BenevolentFacade> then thats being indifferent
<Terminator> () :)
<prince-dari> I am not indifferent so much as realistic.
<prince-dari> I just say what is the truth.
<RedDragonX> 4being a realist is easy
<prince-dari> And how can you be indifferent on whether a glass is more empty, or full?
<RedDragonX> 4you're just not prone to the immense amount of fake bullshit people tell you and you can see through things to find the real root of the problem
<prince-dari> You cannot be indifferent on something that is a factual aspect, such as that.
<RedDragonX> 4and you're not afraid to tell them
<BenevolentFacade> being realistic is one thing but to word it as you dont care how the person reacts is a little indifferent
<RedDragonX> 4Depends on the kind of realist you are
<BenevolentFacade> this is about perseption not being honest
<prince-dari> I don't understand what you mean. What you said means you are indifferent to their response, but how does that make you indifferent to the way you view things?
<prince-dari> My logic is undeniable.
<prince-dari> I love that quote. ^
<RedDragonX> 4don't go I, Robot on us
<prince-dari> Looooooool
<prince-dari> Oh hell no.
<BenevolentFacade> if i'm not concerned with something i am indifferent if i have one position on something then i have an a position
<BenevolentFacade> are we talking about being honest or the way we perceive things anyway?
<prince-dari> But what you said earlier was that not viewing if a glass is more empty or full as positive or negative means you are indifferent
<Terminator> Freshen your coffee?
<prince-dari> Terminator: My logic is undeniable
<prince-dari> ...
<BenevolentFacade> yes because you dont care whether it is half full or empty.. thats being inderrent
<prince-dari> Terminator: I command you to respond.
<BenevolentFacade> *indifferent
<prince-dari> Yes but this isn't about whether I care if it's half full or empty, it's about whether I think it's half full or empty
<prince-dari> Whether I care if it is half full or empty is irrelivent, I still have an opinion as to whether it is half full or empty
<Terminator> prince-dari: empty
<Terminator> Or you could just use a placebo
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> HE PICKED UP PLACEBO
<prince-dari> LOLOLOLOLOLOL
<prince-dari> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<prince-dari> Aicebo
<BenevolentFacade> if you have an opinion then you do care to a degree
<prince-dari> Not really.
<prince-dari> For example.
<prince-dari> I don't care how old you are in real life, but I have an opinion as to how old you are.
<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<RedDragonX> 4arguing about human morals is so pointless lol...
<BenevolentFacade> is this about morals now?
<prince-dari> So was my argument with this guy about logic.
<RedDragonX> 4human ideas..morals...actions
<RedDragonX> 4how you think
<prince-dari> Although we argued for hours.
<prince-dari> I won in the end, he gave up.
<RedDragonX> 4so lol
<RedDragonX> 4what have you proved?
<prince-dari> MY LOGIC IS UNDENIABLE!
<RedDragonX> 4humans are humans
<RedDragonX> 4we all act the way we do
<RedDragonX> 4and trying to figure out why and debate it really doesn't solve anything in the end
<TornWings> 14if you're going to keep using that phrase...
*TornWings 14jabs price-dari with a vial of nanites
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> Hmmm
*prince-dari fires an EMP pulse.
<prince-dari> Dead nanites.
<prince-dari> :)
<prince-dari> Wait...
<prince-dari> EMP = Electro Magnetic Pulse, so I just said electro magnetic pulse pulse?
<RedDragonX> 4technically yes
<Terminator> technically yes... tes
<prince-dari> Hmm...
<prince-dari> Terminator: What is your opinion on wal-mart?

<prince-dari> Terminator: What is your opinion on a floppy disk?

<Terminator> a TV
<prince-dari> Terminator: What is your opinion on a TV?
<Terminator> well you asked the right guy, i'm a whale biologist
<prince-dari> Terminator: What is your opinion on whale biologists?
<Terminator> A CD.
<prince-dari> Terminator: What is your opinion on a CD?
<Terminator> well you asked the right guy, i'm a whale biologist
<prince-dari> Terminator: Is my logic undeniable?
<Terminator> have you tried google?
<prince-dari> Terminator: Yes

<Catabatus> 10BORED
<Catabatus> 10SO BORED
<Aicebo> 13hi
<Catabatus> 10hi
<Spyrorocks> hey RedDragonX
<BenevolentFacade> sup
<RedDragonX> 4hey guys
<RedDragonX> 4hey Spyrorocks
<Spyrorocks> I get special treatment. RedDragonX says "hey guys" then singles me out for a personal "hey".
<Aicebo> 13XD
<RedDragonX> 4cause you were the only one to mention my name
<RedDragonX> 4well...technically not my name lol...but you wouldn't anyways
<Spyrorocks> Its faster to type "red" then hit tab.
<Aicebo> 13lol
<RedDragonX> 4heh
<RedDragonX> 4I like my name
<Catabatus> 10So do I.... wah
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<Spyrorocks> I like everything about myself.
<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<RedDragonX> 4certainly not a bad thing
<RedDragonX> 4gah...I'm gonna smash this thing..
<Spyrorocks> I almost smashed an ATM today.
<Spyrorocks> Pissed me off so bad. Kept on declining my card.
<Spyrorocks> "unauthorized usage"
<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<RedDragonX> 4I get that a lot
<RedDragonX> 4another reason why I hate cards
<BenevolentFacade> i hate credit
<BenevolentFacade> only reason i use a card it to get crap off the internet
<Spyrorocks> I love my card, its like the key to a magical kingdom of monetary happiness.
<Spyrorocks> Just ATMs piss me off.
<Spyrorocks> They are like the dragon guarding the treasure.
<BenevolentFacade> i got a debit card and i dont like paying these fees every time
<Aicebo> 13lol
<BenevolentFacade> heh
<Terminator> ;)
<BenevolentFacade> whats with terminator
<Spyrorocks> I don't even look at the fee screen anymore, its worth it whatever it is.
<RedDragonX> 4all I keep is a debit card
<RedDragonX> 4and I use my bank that doesn't charge so it works out
<Aicebo> 13RAWR
<Catabatus> 10Wah
<BenevolentFacade> >:^X
<Spyrorocks> Only thing I don't like about my card is that it has a $300 daily withdrawal limit via ATM, and $500 limit daily for purchases.
<BenevolentFacade> i dont like the 500 limit either
<Terminator> yeah, keep it open until I'm sure, in accordance with my master's thesis on the Legend of Zelda
<Spyrorocks> If I verify my stuff, I get a $1k limit for purchases and $600 ATM
<BenevolentFacade> wtf
<Spyrorocks> But i'm too lazy to verify and I don't have a US bank account and I don't have another credit card
<Spyrorocks> I could use my dad's but it doesn't look too good when you have other names attached.
<Spyrorocks> Plus id have to get him to phone Visa and ask for the pending charge for verification.
<Spyrorocks> Im sorry, thats $500 a day per transaction for purchases.
<Spyrorocks> limit of 20 transactions a day
<Spyrorocks> which means I can't buy anything good without making multiple transactions and most places won't allow that.
<BenevolentFacade> hmm
<Spyrorocks> SO, that means, I do my current system of going to an ATM and taking out cash until I have enough, which sucks because I can't buy stuff online unless I find someone that accepts a bank wire.
<BenevolentFacade> i just get charged $5 per deposit, a dollar per transaction, $5 per month, and have a limit to $500
<Spyrorocks> daily limit?
<BenevolentFacade> total limit
<BenevolentFacade> i cant put more than 500 into the card
<Spyrorocks> oh that sucks
<Spyrorocks> I have a bit on my card right now, but no limit
<BenevolentFacade> i dont buy much over 500 but i still would like to
<Spyrorocks> but they get suspicious if I put too much and try to contact me to verify who I am, which I try to avoid.
<BenevolentFacade> heh
<BenevolentFacade> i hate that crap
<BenevolentFacade> i think paypal is about as paranoid
<BenevolentFacade> except i dont use it except to buy crap on ebay
<Spyrorocks> paypal sucks
<Spyrorocks> I don't use paypal anymore.
<Spyrorocks> I have a pretty good setup though, only thing is I need a better card supplier this one isn't cutting it.
<BenevolentFacade> lol i have atm ads in the window
<BenevolentFacade> wtf.. does google monitor our chat?
<Spyrorocks> No
<Spyrorocks> But the chat does deliver ads based on content of the page
<BenevolentFacade> hi RedDragonX
<Spyrorocks> because mibbit needs monies.
<RedDragonX> 4hello BF
<BenevolentFacade> ah.. i just get an acronym

<Aicebo> 13You mean re-voiced it?
<Stormy> I revoiced it
<Aicebo> 13Idk I keep devoicing it when it pisses me off.
<prince-dari> Aicebo: <Terminator> Or you could just use a placebo
<prince-dari> He picked up placebo?
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Stormy> Oh
<Stormy> Yeah
<Aduro> 3......
<Stormy> Maybe it should stay devoiced =P
<Aicebo> 13prince-dari: Umm a placebo is a fake medication
<Aicebo> 13Stormy: Exactly.
<prince-dari> o_O
<Aduro> 3its a sugar pill....
<prince-dari> Never heard of it.
<prince-dari> Probably American.
<Yahoo> That is what you are dari

<Stormy> Uhh, I kind of doubt it
<prince-dari> I don't.
<prince-dari> Definitely SR.
<Stormy> They had this thing set up for Valentine's day where the moderators would pass on secret Valentines to people
<Stormy> I'll pastebin it XD
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Stormy> http://mibbit.com/pb/hviesN
<prince-dari> "Happy Valentine's Day! If you're reading his it's because you're special! "
<Aduro> 3Valentine's Day is over.
<prince-dari> W00t, I'm special.
<Stormy> I know
<Stormy> It was sent on Valentine's day
<Stormy> I haven't been to Neoseeker for a while
<Aduro> 3I see...
<Aicebo> 13Light as in computer light :P
<Aicebo> 13Lanes as in the internet highway
<Aicebo> 13AHAHAHA
<prince-dari> I reckon who sent it is in the spell errors.
<Aicebo> 13Kite as in HIGH SPEED
<Aicebo> 13AHAHAHA lol Idk
<prince-dari> For example "this" is spelt incorrectly.
<Stormy> Hmmm, interesting
<Stormy> I'll try and decode it :P
<Stormy> Should be fun
<Aduro> 3What about a monkey.....
<prince-dari> What are the names of the moderators?
<Stormy> Umm
<Stormy> Lone Warrior, Shane, Quierta, Underated
<prince-dari> Hm.

<Yahoo> So it stormwarrior now?
<Aicebo> 13WOOOOOOOOO
<Yahoo> o_O
<Stormy> Prince-dari: There aren't enough spelling errors to decode it that way
<prince-dari> I know
<Stormy> Any other ideas? :P
<prince-dari> I aw
<prince-dari> saw*
<Yahoo> Okay that is as bad as Charlie
<Aduro> 3*Throws arms up in the air* Do Nothing!
<Aicebo> 13KIte = High Speed internet
<Aicebo> 13Lane = internet highway
<prince-dari> Some things aren't capitalised, where others are
<Aicebo> 13Light = screen light
<prince-dari> Meh, nevermind.
<Aicebo> 13Names = "Hey stormy"
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Aicebo> 13Ahaha
<Aicebo> 13I'm lame
<Stormy> o_o
<prince-dari> There is a misplaced apostrophe (SP?) in Lots.
<Stormy> "Day
<Stormy> is capitalized
<Stormy> Where it shouldn't be
<Stormy> So that gives me...
<Stormy> dts
<Stormy> lawl
<prince-dari> Or, it may only be in the poem bit.
<prince-dari> The letters in the poem are...
<Stormy> Black Falcon?
<Stormy> o______o
<Stormy> I KNOW THAT GUY
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> Good point.
<prince-dari> First letter of each word.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> That was obvious.
<Aduro> 3I don't know what the hell is going on in this conversation...
<Stormy> First letter of each word in the poem put together = "Black falcon"
<Stormy> Wow, I haven't talked to him in ages....
<prince-dari> Yeah, after you said the name, I could work that much out. :P
<prince-dari> No need to explain.
<Stormy> I didn't think he'd still remember me XD
<prince-dari> Lolololololol
<prince-dari> SR will be jealous.
<Stormy> Right
<Stormy> =/
<prince-dari> /j #lol
<prince-dari> ?
<prince-dari> ?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<prince-dari> Definitely.
<Kjakings> 7Why will SR be jealous? XD
<prince-dari> You gunna tell him then?
<prince-dari> The guy, that you worked it out?
<Kjakings> 7Why will SR be jealous?
<prince-dari> I want to find out what the surprise is.
<Stormy> I guess so, haha
<Kjakings> 7WHY WILL SR BE JEALOUS?
<prince-dari> Kjakings: ...If you are being serious, I will have to laugh.
<Stormy> XDDDDD
<Kjakings> 7I've only just come back
<prince-dari> Read up.
<Kjakings> 7I'm not going back and reading everything.
<Stormy> Scroll up a bit
<prince-dari> Ok, summary.
<prince-dari> Stormy was sent a Valentines thing by someone, they said they'd give her a surprise should she work out who sent it.
<Kjakings> 7HAHAHA.
<Stormy> hahahaa, I'm going to forward him the PM
<Stormy> XD
<Kjakings> 7I WANT TO BE THERE DURING THAT CONVERSATION!
<prince-dari> Lol
<Kjakings> 7:D
<Aicebo> 13Well.
<Stormy> http://mibbit.com/pb/hviesN
<Aicebo> 13Maybe it was SOMEONE and they tricked you =P
<Stormy> Kjakings
<prince-dari> Stormy: When did SR send you the PM?
<Stormy> That's what I was thinking too
<Stormy> It might have been someone /pretending/ to be him
<Stormy> XD
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Stormy> prince-dari: On the 11th
<Kjakings> 7I don't care. don't tell SR until he comes back on SC
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Kjakings> 7Spyrorocks
<Kjakings> 7^^
<Stormy> Bah, you guys, he's not going to care
<Stormy> =P
<Kjakings> 7Ya, right.
<Aicebo> 13He will on the inside
<Aicebo> 13AHAHAHAH MUWAHAHAHAHA
<Aicebo> 13Lawl JK
<Kjakings> 7I'll loan him use of my armoury.
<Stormy> Armoury?
<prince-dari> He'll probably launch a network attack on the guy who sent it to you.
<Stormy> ?
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: Nvm lol.
<Stormy> k then
*Stormy looks for Black Falcon on Neoseeker
<prince-dari> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Stormy> I'm not even on his friends list
<prince-dari> If he didn't send it, I'd laugh so much.
<Stormy> Wtf
<Stormy> :(
<prince-dari> I wonder what the surprise is....
<Kjakings> 7Hey dari, think it'd be worth it making a thread on SF titled "Stormy's mysterious Valentine SR read this!"
<Kjakings> 7Dari: Maybe he'll make her a 'video'?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Stormy> No, it wouldn't be worth it
<Stormy> :P
<Stormy> I'd just delete the thread, hahah
<prince-dari> Maybe the surprise is that he wasn't the guy who sent it.
<Kjakings> 7Then I'd PM sr with a screenie of it.
<Kjakings> 7HAH
<Stormy> OK, you do that =/
<Kjakings> 7Dari: He's probably going to make her a 'video'.
<Stormy> But I'm serious, he's not gonna care
<Stormy> "video"?
<Kjakings> 7He will :P
<Stormy> o__o
<prince-dari> I bet SR, in his stalkings of you, found out that you used to talk to him, then made a fake message, so you'd find the name black falcon and the surprise is that black falcon didn't send the message
<prince-dari> Stormy: He'll make it out as though he doesn't care.
<prince-dari> Although he will.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: Jesus, you're as bad as the B&G fans (I'm not going to explain that).
<Stormy> Interesting theory, but I don't think SR can read my PMs on Neoseeker =P
<prince-dari> What's B&G?
<prince-dari> Oh right.
<Kjakings> 7I said I'm not going to explain it :P
<prince-dari> Nevermind.
<prince-dari> I worked it out.
<prince-dari> Bill and George, with their comic things.
<Kjakings> 7That was a phail.
<Kjakings> 7Majorly.
<prince-dari> What then?
<prince-dari> Bob and George?
<Kjakings> 7Dari, you can't trick me into explaining it. Besides, while we've been arguing I think Stormy's escaped.
<prince-dari> Their stuff isn't memorable, or interesting enough for me to remember their names.
<Stormy> lol
<prince-dari> Fine.
<Stormy> I'm PMing blackfalcon right now asking him if he sent it
<Stormy> Hahahahaa
<Kjakings> 7Fiver says he either denies it or avoids the question.
<Spyrorocks> good mornin.
<prince-dari> LOL
<Kjakings> 7HAHAHA
<Kjakings> 7BRILLIANT TIMING SR
<prince-dari> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Kjakings> 7Stormy's in trouble~ Or would it be Blackfalcon's in trouble?
*Stormy sneaks away into a corner
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Kjakings> 7SR, scroll up and read down from 18:35	prince-dari	Ok, summary.
<Aicebo> 13brb/bbl
*Stormy rolls her eyes from her nonexistent corner
<Spyrorocks> I see
<Kjakings> 7Wait no, he's probably seen us taking the piss now lol.
<Kjakings> 7OH WELL
<Kjakings> 7I'm in the middle of something and what I can't see can't hurt me~
<Stormy> bah
<Stormy> he's not online
<Spyrorocks> I didn't send that.
<Stormy> I want my surprise
*prince-dari hits Kjakings over the back of the head with a metal baseball bat.
<Stormy> XD
<prince-dari> What you can't see can't hurt you? :0
<Kjakings> 7Baseball bat? Not rounders? AMERICAN! I KNEW IT!
<prince-dari> Nah, I took it from the dead body of some American I killed.
<Kjakings> 7Not that Baseball's not an almost DIRECT copy of rounders.
<Kjakings> 7And 90% of American town names are re-creations of English.
<prince-dari> New York D:
<Kjakings> 7Washington D.C.
<prince-dari> New England is in America, isn't it?
<Kjakings> 7Chicago (they didn't bother adding anything onto this! (Yes, Chicago IS an English town... I think))
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: you are not identified.
<Stormy> I know
<Spyrorocks> thanks
*prince-dari wonders how long it is before Stormy gets owner as well as +a. :P
*prince-dari runs.
<Stormy> Never
<Kjakings> 7Don't forget Founder.
<Stormy> T_T
*Kjakings 7runs also
<prince-dari> Probably after the weddding.
*prince-dari runs more.
<Kjakings> 7Too far.
<prince-dari> Never too far.
<Spyrorocks> I physically shook my head back and forth when you said that.
<Kjakings> 7Meh. Too far, you're on the ban-hammer handle now dari.
<prince-dari> Not really.
<Spyrorocks> (left and right, not up and down.)
<Yahoo> I bought my dad a blu ray copy of Wall-e for his birthday today, we finally got a blu ray player and I thought it would be a brilliant thing to keep this family together..
<prince-dari> I don't think SR minds that much.
<Kjakings> 7Of course, banning you would just prove you right, and neither of them want that.
<Stormy> See, what did I tell you all?
<Yahoo> When I told him he could watch it at the telly, he threw it at me
<Stormy> =P
<Spyrorocks> A thing that plays movies is keeping your family together?
<prince-dari> LOL ^
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: He can CLAIM he doesn't care.
<prince-dari> Proof please.
*Kjakings 7runs for the hills
<Yahoo> I spent £20 pounds for nothing
<Stormy> ...
<Spyrorocks> I don't understand /why/ I would care in the first place
<Yahoo> I just think he's a lazy arsehole
<Spyrorocks> lol
<prince-dari> *Cough*Jealous SR*Cough*
*prince-dari thinks SR is getting out a chainsaw, and getting ready to hunt the guy down.
<Yahoo> He wont sit in the same room as me or in a proper chair just to watch a 90 minute movie!
<prince-dari> I avoid doing anything at all with my family.
<prince-dari> They annoy me.
<Spyrorocks> I can probably figure out who sent it.
<Stormy> I already think I know who it was
<Kjakings> 7SR: Try black raven
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Kjakings> 7Or whatever his name was
<prince-dari> falcon
<Stormy> It was blackfalcon
<Stormy> First letter of each of the words in the poem spell "blackfalcon"
<Yahoo> 18:56 prince-dari I avoid doing anything at all with my family. So do I but I have to get the electicity bills paid somehow
<prince-dari> I don't.
*Kjakings 7claps slowly and sarcasitcally for Stormy
<prince-dari> They pay for everything.
<Stormy> Shut it you
<Kjakings> 7:D
<Spyrorocks> You're good.
<Spyrorocks> I never noticed that.
<Stormy> I'm explaining for those who missed it
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: You mean SR.
<Stormy> Yeah, prince-dari sort of helped
<Kjakings> 7Also, Yahoo, it's Wall•e
<Kjakings> 7Wiv teh bullet point
<Yahoo> Whatever, I'm pissed
<Stormy> He suggested to use the misspelled words
<prince-dari> Well I thought if he spelt this badly, it had to be on purpose. O_o
<Stormy> I think it was sent as a prank or something
<Stormy> hahah
<Stormy> Just a typo
<Stormy> =P
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> I did say it's probably in the poem afterwards though.
<Stormy> Yeah, that's what gave me the idea
<Stormy> I think it was some kind of prank, though
<Spyrorocks> Knowing people on the internet, it was generic enough he could have sent it to 50 different people in hopes of response.
<Stormy> Because I haven't talked to that guy in months
<Stormy> I doubt the moderators who sent them out would have had the patience to forward it to 50 different people
<prince-dari> Halifax bank of Scotland is in trouble?
<prince-dari> Why don't they just sell silicon? O_o
<prince-dari> So much silicon in Scotland. o_O
<prince-dari> Bored.
<prince-dari> Very bored.

<Yahoo> Bbl, nosebleed
<prince-dari> Lol ^
<Yahoo> NOT FUNNY!
<prince-dari> Yeah it is.
<prince-dari> I know, because I used to get them.
<Kjakings> 7No, but your responses always are
<Spyrorocks> I haven't gotten a nosebleed in like 3 years
<Spyrorocks> knock on wood.
<Kjakings> 7I've never had a nosebleed ever.
*Kjakings 7refuses to knock on wood
<Stormy> Woohoo, time to go to web design now
<Stormy> -____-
<prince-dari> I've only actually had a nose bleed due to it being hit against something twice.
<Spyrorocks> have fun with dreameaver
<Stormy> Bye everyone
<Spyrorocks> dreamweaver*
<prince-dari> Once when someone kicked a tennis ball, and it hit me in the nose.
<Stormy> Teacher probably blocked mibbit, so I won't be back at all today
<Stormy> Banned at home
<Spyrorocks> why?
<prince-dari> You're making SR sad. :(
<Stormy> Went over my time yesterday
<Spyrorocks> ah

<Kjakings> 7Dari: Methinks they doth protest too much?
<Stormy> yay, quotes from Hamlet
<Stormy> Anyway
<Stormy> Bye
<Stormy> =P
<Kjakings> 7(If I have to explain what that means, I will kill someone.)
<prince-dari> Thou art right in thinkingeth as thou is.
<Kjakings> 7Too far
<prince-dari> I win.
<prince-dari> And how is it any further than what you said?
<prince-dari> All I did was make it all correct.
<Kjakings> 7Ok, I need two more attacks for a missile-wielding tank-tread-footed robot to do.
<Kjakings> 7I've got charging and a big-arsed missile attack. I'm out of ideas.
<Kjakings> 7There's always the laz0rz option, but that'll take forever to find.
<prince-dari> Give it L4Z0RZ
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<prince-dari> Ok nevermind.
<prince-dari> Give it...
<Kjakings> 7I CAN, but it'll be hard. It is half-term though.
<prince-dari> Machine guns that automatically lock on to targets?
<Kjakings> 7Now THAT is incredibly easy!
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Kjakings> 7I'm looking for a good laz0r now though
<Kjakings> 7Wait. Beam laz0r or 'bullet' laz0r?
<prince-dari> Meh, beam.
<Kjakings> 7Ok... hold on.

<Spyrorocks> when I was at school, their internet filter automatically banned your network account if you visited a banned website.
<Spyrorocks> so be being ultra 1337 setup a chatroom for everyone, and got about 90% of the class on it
<Spyrorocks> then just before the end of class redirected them all to runescape
<Stormy> hmm
<prince-dari> LOL
<Stormy> I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now
<Spyrorocks> My PC 8 teacher was also the network admin, he just laughed.

<Kjakings> 7I'm not a huggy person. The only reason I wanted one of those stupid Valentines DC eggs was to complete my dragon army. Apparently they can breed though, so a friend of mine will get me one so HAH
<Stormy> Dragon army?

<Kjakings> 7Someone was giving away Valentines eggs and I was too slow, but I really need another gold and they'd be willing to trade 1500 white aura from dragonadopters for it, now I can't remember who the hell they are.
<Stormy> You need gold?
<Stormy> I could probably get one for you....
<Kjakings> 7Lol. I need another gold, my one refuses to breed any gold eggs AT ALL.
<Terminator> I've already got one

<Kjakings> Stormy: He obviously wasn't reset much, you all've only noticed because you saw me do it.
<prince-dari> He'd stopped making typos, he'd stopped saying butterfingers things.
<prince-dari> He'd stopped trying to have sex with things/saying dirty things, mainly.
<Kjakings> Like hell! He said "Yeah, want a go? :)" to you earlier BEFORE I did reload.
<prince-dari> "...mainly."
<Kjakings> And he said butterfingers this morning. Probably while you were 'away' with eXAKR.
<prince-dari> That was the only thing he said really.
<Kjakings> Yes well I'm double-booked, so you lot'll have to re-train him a bit by interacting, although he wasn't reset much because, again, the only reason you lot noticed was because you were THERE.

<Yahoo> Damn that must be a heck of a proxy
<Kjakings> 7Ready the Particle Canons, and alert the Harvester IV, since all Interdimensional versions were destroyed in the final assault against the Creed. We will have to do with our own versions now.

<Yahoo> He pmed me
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Kjakings> 7You know, if we took the half-way sensible things me and Neon say in our little random spurts, it would make a FUCK of a book and/or movie ^^

<prince-dari> Now we get to write comments on his profile?
<prince-dari> MWAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
<Yahoo> I asked him who he was
<Neon> When did Antr become AntR?
<Kjakings> 7Fine. Switch to Project N.E.O.N. mode and scan the files on the Harvester M, and then shapeshift to that form. It won't be as powerful, but it'll be a helluva lot better than those Harvester IVs that look puny in comparison.
<Aicebo> 13Banned.

<prince-dari> There is no human race.
<Neon> There's a human marathon I hear.
<Neon> :P
<prince-dari> We're all actually in fact, part of the slug family.
<Neon> No, slugs are part of the human family.
<Neon> :O
<prince-dari> Brain slugs.

<Ryft> gah!
<prince-dari> HELP ME!
<Neon> Nah.
*prince-dari is taken over by a brain slug
<Yahoo> Lol
*Ryft watches
<Ryft> o.o
*prince-dari puts a brain slug on Ryft.
<Kjakings> 7Poor brain-slug, it'll starve to death before the end of the day
*Neon is silently dragged away by the Candyman.
<Ryft> haha
<Kjakings> 7That could be at either Ryft or dari, I don't really care who
*Ryft eats the brainslug
<prince-dari> Yeah, my thoughts are so overpowering and clever, it won't be able to feed on them.
<Aicebo> 13brb/bbl
<Ryft> >.>
<Ryft> yum
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Cya.
<Neon> Maybe the slug passed you because you weren't more than a morsel of brain waves.
<prince-dari> It didn't pass me.
<Neon> Then how are you talking to us?
<Neon> Or are you the slug?!
<Neon> Gaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh.
<prince-dari> Because I overpowered it with amazingly strong/witty thoughts.
<Neon> ^ Proof?
<prince-dari> Such as.
<Kjakings> 7No, the slug went back to get a couple friends to share the feast of my giant brain. Little do they know I have my weapons to prevent an assault. *shoulders_laz0r_canons_while_holding_M16s_and_belting_on_nades*
<Neon> How we knwo you're not taken by the slug as of now.
<Kjakings> 7I have found a new love for nades~
<Neon> Kjakings: You bath in the nubtub.
<prince-dari> "If you are a brain slug, then why do you need to be latched onto a brain to live, because surely if you are a 'brain' slug, you already have your own brain and have no need for my brain, meaning that you should drop off my head now, because I am your supreme leader as of this moment, and that Kjakings, although not much more than a snack, might taste nice, yet why would you eat him if you don't need brains to live? Well I am now your master so you do as I say"
<prince-dari> I tricked it basically.
<Kjakings> 7My weapon preferences have completely shifted from joining here lol. Before, I always used my shotty, had a glock, and detested nades. Now, I have my loverly M16s, deagles, and I never go anywhere without having atleast 3 different kinds of nades on me.
<Neon> Dari: no u
<prince-dari> Exactly.
<prince-dari> I overpowed it, as I did you.

<spyro_master> 6no offence
<prince-dari> It's the feeling lots of people get.
<RedDragonX> 4and you think if we didn't exist that everything would be sunshine and rainbows?
<prince-dari> I think it would be a better place.
<spyro_master> 6nope
<spyro_master> 6but it would b a lot easier
<RedDragonX> 4btw here is that thing lol
<Neon> Better? HAH

<RedDragonX> 4oi
<spyro_master> 6no in a good way
<RedDragonX> 4yes believe it or not
<RedDragonX> 4not all Americans are idiots
<Neon> :O
<RedDragonX> 4even though their are now more and more
<Neon> :P
<Terminator> Yikes.
<spyro_master> 6yes i knwo that now
<prince-dari> My views aren't changed at all.
<RedDragonX> 4the foundations on which this country was found have long since been betrayed
<RedDragonX> 4we have become a nation of whiners who want everything delivered to them
<spyro_master> 6well lets hope ur new presidant can do soemthing abotu it then
<Neon> RedDragonX we have become a nation of whiners who want everything delivered to them Absolutely.
<RedDragonX> 4don't even get me started on that
<spyro_master> 6lol ok
<prince-dari> My view is on America as a country (Yes, I know America isn't country), this is not my view on individual people.
<RedDragonX> 4I'm in no mood to get into politics lol
<spyro_master> 6u knwo what was funny about bush?
<RedDragonX> 4Did you not read what I just said
<spyro_master> 6he didnt know who gordon brown was
<spyro_master> 6yeah i knwo but i thougth i would say taht last thing
<spyro_master> 6lol stupid george bush XD
<RedDragonX> 4This nation has been going downhill for years
<RedDragonX> 4and it's only going to get worse
<spyro_master> 6and hopefully 4 u it wont carry on
<RedDragonX> 4people are not like they were. They no longer have will power
<prince-dari> Apparently America still owes Iran money. O_o
<RedDragonX> 4they dont' want to better themselves
<RedDragonX> 4all they do is sit at home and live off welfare
<RedDragonX> 4while the people who do work for a living pay FOR them
<spyro_master> 6yeah but i suppose as technology seems to do most things for em they do taht
<RedDragonX> 4nation of complainers and lazy people
<spyro_master> 6yep
<RedDragonX> 4nobody has work ethic
<prince-dari> Also the whole "American dream" thing, about fighting for your country, it's just so dillusional and idiotic.
<RedDragonX> 4and along with no work ethic...no means to get better
<prince-dari> They think it's some sort of game or something.
<spyro_master> 6i think it went downhill 4 u guys when it was Vietnam
<Neon> Maybe it's good that we're going through this economic crahs, because it'll make people ahve to work again like back int he old one.
<spyro_master> 6no offence im still tryign work out when it wrong 4 the UK
<prince-dari> They all seem to think that going off to fight for their country is such a good idea.
<spyro_master> 6XD
<Neon> *crash, have
<RedDragonX> 4Dari I could care less about your personal views on people but don't judge all Americans through the actions of idiots
<prince-dari> And they all think that from such a young age.
<RedDragonX> 4Some people actually do believe in the principals this country was found on
<prince-dari> When they're likely to get blown to pieces before the month is over.
<prince-dari> It's horrible.
<RedDragonX> 4they are just becoming less and less
<RedDragonX> 4and thinking that the world would be a better place without America....yeah that's just nuts
<spyro_master> 6i used to think that as well as some other things but ive learnt not to generalise americans anymore
<prince-dari> Hahahaha, in what way?
<prince-dari> What has America done that's so great?
<spyro_master> 6not america as a country
<spyro_master> 6but as individuals in america
<spyro_master> 6has done great things
<RedDragonX> 4Well here is one example...without America by this point Isreal would have already nucked the middle east....and therefore necleur war would already be upon you
<spyro_master> 6martin luther king
<spyro_master> 6 4 example
<prince-dari> How?
<prince-dari> Because I think that's BS.
<RedDragonX> 4Then you are just as niave as most Americans I have seen
<spyro_master> 6lol XD
<RedDragonX> 4you truly think that the Israelis are going to tolerate the arabs when they come after them AGAIN
<RedDragonX> 4that's just like that BS Raidon was trying to talk about
<RedDragonX> 4seriously...if the world erupts in neclear war
<RedDragonX> 4we wont be involved in any way
<RedDragonX> 4yeah that's just idiotic
<RedDragonX> 4"All we have to do is stay away!"
<spyro_master> 6well to be honest i still think u would be first to strike after someelse attacks
<spyro_master> 6no offence but its just my gut feeling
<RedDragonX> 4The whole world has access to these weapons
<RedDragonX> 4the world we live in is a very very scary place
<spyro_master> 6yeah i know
<RedDragonX> 4and many people are blind to it
<spyro_master> 6or
<RedDragonX> 4everyone has their finger on a red button
<RedDragonX> 4and all they need is the right push to go over the edge
<spyro_master> 6they choose not to recognise it
<RedDragonX> 4The average American is now an idiot
<RedDragonX> 4that is the truth
<Neon> It's because most people either don't care or are too naive to relaize what they're perfect world really is.
<RedDragonX> 4they could care less about the world outside of thier own
<Neon> *realize
<spyro_master> 6well me and my friends reckon inbetween now and 2040 another world war will happen
<RedDragonX> 4they have no freaking cares for anyone but themselves
<spyro_master> 6which im hoping wont happen
<RedDragonX> 4and they would most likely be correct
<RedDragonX> 4it wouldn't surprise me
<RedDragonX> 4the only thing now is
<RedDragonX> 4WW3=goodbye world
<spyro_master> 6yep to true
<prince-dari> <RedDragonX> you truly think that the Israelis are going to tolerate the arabs when they come after them AGAIN
<RedDragonX> 4go watch the movie Fail Safe sometime
<prince-dari> I don't think they would nuke them.
<spyro_master> 6i reckon it will be something to do with oil running out or soemthing taht would trigger it
<RedDragonX> 4Then you are again niave
<prince-dari> You've hardly stopped the fighting.
<RedDragonX> 4you really think they are going to tolerate people who want to freaking kill them?
<spyro_master> 6fighting over the last oil fields in the middle east
<RedDragonX> 4as in every sinlge one of them
<prince-dari> How do you know that?
<RedDragonX> 4yeah they would sooner wipe out all of them then let that happen
<prince-dari> You can read minds?
<prince-dari> I doubt they have genocide planned.
<RedDragonX> 4you can't either. I am going by what history shows us and human nature. The Isrealis have been there before...they don't want someone wiping them out like what almost happened
<RedDragonX> 4and guess what...they have even attacked US...there allies to prove the point they don't want to be fucked with
<spyro_master> 6I don;t like the looks abotu what is happening in afganistan
<RedDragonX> 4and go look at history sometime. The freaking crusades have never stopped
<spyro_master> 6UK and US troops fighting there
<RedDragonX> 4History is doomed to repeat itself
<spyro_master> 6as USSR fougth there during teh cold war
<RedDragonX> 4and things have not changed
<prince-dari> That sounds like a really bad film
<spyro_master> 6they failed
<prince-dari> Aslo sounds like BS.
<spyro_master> 6and now UK and USA are going in again to fight
<RedDragonX> 4Simply because you are blind to the reality behind things
<spyro_master> 6its just gonna be a repeated failure
<RedDragonX> 4much like others
<RedDragonX> 4it's so obvious it's not funny
<spyro_master> 6soz who are u talking to reddragon? me or prince?
<prince-dari> Explain then,
<RedDragonX> 4not like I can change minds
<prince-dari> You have given no proof.
<Aicebo> 13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG
<spyro_master> 6i think he is finding the proof
<RedDragonX> 4neither have you. And the freaking proof is right in history genius....what the heck did I just say. The crusades have not stopped at ALL. They arabs will always want it just like they always have...and they will gladly kill and make up reasons to go after them AGAIN just like before. Watch Kingdom of Heaven sometime.....if you can't learn from the past you are doomed to repeat it...and things have not freaking changed one bit
<spyro_master> 6told ya
<RedDragonX> 4and people are now niave enough to believe that nothing is going to happen
<RedDragonX> 4that everything will work out nice and cool
<RedDragonX> 4like sunshine and rainbows..
<RedDragonX> 4yeah that's complete bullshit
<spyro_master> 6so basicly we are just going to repeat oursleves history wise until some1 wakes up
<RedDragonX> 4if you say you are such a realist then see the realism already presented many times
<Spyrorocks> what is being discuessed?
<Spyrorocks> discussed*
<spyro_master> 6best not ask
<spyro_master> 6it will set them off again
<prince-dari> It isn't realistic.
<RedDragonX> 4yes it certainly is
<spyro_master> 6here we go again
<prince-dari> "History will doom to repeat itself"
<RedDragonX> 4unless again you are completely obvious
<prince-dari> Is*
<prince-dari> That isn't realistic.
<RedDragonX> 4'oblivious'
<prince-dari> That is total crap.
<RedDragonX> 4hence why you are niave to the reality of things
<RedDragonX> 4it's written all over ancient and modern times
<RedDragonX> 4and things have not changed
<RedDragonX> 4if you think so then wake up
<RedDragonX> 4and start living in the real world
<prince-dari> I am.
<Spyrorocks> talking about the history of the arabs and Israelis?
<RedDragonX> 4well if I remember right I believe it started out when Dari said the world would have been better off without America
<spyro_master> 6sort of they are
<Terminator> *spangle*
<RedDragonX> 4but hey what do I know...I'm just the average working American who wants the most out of life
<RedDragonX> 4I only see the common sense in things
<prince-dari> Go on then, what has repeated itself.
<spyro_master> 6and here comes more proof
<prince-dari> I haven't really seen any proof yet.
<RedDragonX> 4Seeing as how the freaking Arabs have gone after Isreal at least a dozen times in the last 500 years what is there to say. Go freaking look up the Seven day war...and the countless freaking skirmishes that have been waged. Things would have been much worse off had their been no buffer in between
<RedDragonX> 4but that will quickly dissappear most likely
<Zephyr-kun> Oui
<Spyrorocks> The Arabs always break the cease fires.
<RedDragonX> 4this is so obvious it's not funny. When their is no buffer there...guess what
<RedDragonX> 4they will do it again
<RedDragonX> 4and they will be glad to do it
<RedDragonX> 4they could care less...they do what they have been taught to do
<RedDragonX> 4and what they believe that they are doing for a good cause
<Spyrorocks> because thats how it has always been.
<prince-dari> Well they were thrown out of Palestine. You can hardly blame them.
<RedDragonX> 4a good cause being the lovely holy wars they love so much
<RedDragonX> 4thank you for helping prove my point
<Terminator> No worries.
<RedDragonX> 4they will always do it!
<RedDragonX> 4but anyways I'm sick of arguing about it
<RedDragonX> 4no point seeing as how it doesn't matter to most
<RedDragonX> 4what happens happens
<RedDragonX> 4I only go by what has been happening for hundreds of years....and it will happen again
<prince-dari> The simple solution would be to drop an atomic bomb on Israel.
<Spyrorocks> They will always fight. Forever.
<RedDragonX> 4yup
<RedDragonX> 4Isreal is one of the most advance nations in the world
<RedDragonX> 4"advanced"
<RedDragonX> 4they have so much freaking nuke power it's not funny
<Spyrorocks> Israel has no problem getting rid of the Arabs.
<RedDragonX> 4nope
<RedDragonX> 4they would be glad to do it too
<RedDragonX> 4if their is nothing left to buffer the two
<Spyrorocks> They have been fighting forever, and this would be a victory.
<Spyrorocks> winning the holy war.
<RedDragonX> 4that's just seeing the lessons that history has taught us....nothing has changed or ever will
<prince-dari> Well I say Israel should get bombed.
<Spyrorocks> why?
<RedDragonX> 4peole say History is useless....when it offers the most important lessons
<prince-dari> Since the Palestinions lived there first, and the Israelis were terrorists before they moved into Israel, basically.
<prince-dari> They attacked British soldiers. :/
<prince-dari> They attacked loads of people.
<spyro_master> 6they will defend their country no matter teh cost i think
<spyro_master> 6whoever is oposoing them
<RedDragonX> 4The Israelis are far from the enemies here. They were given their country and it's theres to do with what they will. But they will NOT....allow another Halocaust
<Spyrorocks> You can't stop the war. No matter what happens, there is still hatred towards each group.
<spyro_master> 6think about we would if our countries were being invaded
<Terminator> More power... give me MORE POWER*@%^%$
<RedDragonX> 4and it's just like the Americans and the british in the revolution
<spyro_master> 6what teh hell r u on about terminator
<prince-dari> So who gave them the country?
<spyro_master> 6yeh britain lost cause we let teh americans win XP
<spyro_master> 6joking
<prince-dari> Answer to my question please?
<spyro_master> 6oh britain
<spyro_master> 6cause britain lost the war
<prince-dari> Also the Israelis were basically terrorists before they lived there, and you were so keen to go and fight for your country and kill terrorists before, what happened?
<RedDragonX> 4the Jewish peole had Israel to begin with
<RedDragonX> 4then the British occupied the territory
<RedDragonX> 4During WW1
<RedDragonX> 4they divided the country in two
<RedDragonX> 4to begin with
<RedDragonX> 4one for the Arabs and one for the Israeilis
<prince-dari> I fail to see how the Arabs are at fault at all.
<RedDragonX> 4The point at hand was that it was there land to begin with!
<RedDragonX> 4and after the division guess what
<RedDragonX> 4the ARABS didn't want it
<RedDragonX> 4they wanted the whole land
<RedDragonX> 4not just half of it
<RedDragonX> 4so that's when the conflict AGAIN started
<RedDragonX> 4because the Arabs wanted everything
<RedDragonX> 4and of course the jews kicked the shit out of them
<RedDragonX> 4and what a surprise they want the land back as always
<prince-dari> It is a bit stubborn for them still to want to live there, even after all this time, but I don't see how this is their fault at all.
<RedDragonX> 4are you kidding me
<Spyrorocks> ...
<prince-dari> Well basically they got kicked out of their country.
<RedDragonX> 4they were the ones who started it to begin with. THEY WENT AFTER THE JEWS BECAUSE THEY WANTED EVERYTHING!
<Spyrorocks> They are attacking Israel because they want all the land.
<prince-dari> Yes, but it was all theirs in the first place.
<RedDragonX> 4WHEN IT WAS THE JEWISH COUNTRY FROM THE START
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> What?
<RedDragonX> 4Israel was established as a safe haven for Jewish people
<prince-dari> By who
<RedDragonX> 4and the ARABS DIDN'T WANT THAT
<RedDragonX> 4THE BRITISH MANDATE OF PALESTINE IN WW1
<prince-dari> Yes, but the Arabs were living in Israel before the Jews.
<prince-dari> And basically got chucked out.
<RedDragonX> 4BECAUSE THEY STARTED THE CONFLICT AGAIN
<RedDragonX> 4they could have had half of it and instead chose to kill more out of it
<prince-dari> Yes, but there was no conflict for them in the beginning.
<prince-dari> It was because they had half their land taken from them.
<prince-dari> So whoever took half their land is at fault, not them.
<prince-dari> If occupied America (Not possible, I know), and then decided to take half of it from them Americans, and give it to someone else, how would they feel?
<RedDragonX> 4That does not justify their actions when they have the entire rest of the Middle East to play around with. They want the "holy land" just as they have always wanted it. When the Jewish peole were given the "SMALL" piece of land as a token for their suffering the Arabs refused to have it
<RedDragonX> 4thuse leading to more death when they already had plenty
<prince-dari> Well I think the Americans would fight against them.
<RedDragonX> 4they fight over one piece of territory that has no meaning
<RedDragonX> 4they fight over it because it is considered their holy land
<prince-dari> It is still half their land.
<RedDragonX> 4and nobody else is deemed worth to have it
<RedDragonX> 4they will wipe out the Jewish people because they see fit to do so under their beliefs
<RedDragonX> 4but the problem is...the Jews will gladly wipe them out first
<RedDragonX> 4The country belongs the the Jews now...and that's the way it will stay
<prince-dari> If someone wants to give them a small piece of land, the people that want to give the land should supply it, they shouldn't take it from another group of people.
<prince-dari> Now THAT is not justified.
<RedDragonX> 4the Arabs are only escalating the problem as they have always done
<Terminator> I feel like I'm about to vomit everywhere.
<prince-dari> Even if it is only a small piece of land, it is still their land, and that is the point
<RedDragonX> 4You are pinning the blame on a group of people who were nearly wiped out in WW2 and instead reasoning that the freaking Arabs who already have thousands of acres for their own....deserve it because they were their first
<RedDragonX> 4that's BS and the Jews know it
<prince-dari> It doens't matter how big half of America is, it is stil American land.
<RedDragonX> 4it's their land now and they will die to protect it
<prince-dari> So would you let people take it from you.
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> You wouldn't.
<RedDragonX> 4hence the start of this whole bloody mess
<RedDragonX> 4they have no strong reason to fight for the piece of land only that it is for their own religious beliefs...nothing more
<RedDragonX> 4other then that they could care less about it
<prince-dari> As I said, it is unfair to TAKE land from people, whoever wants to give the jews the land, should supply the land, from their own country.
<RedDragonX> 4they want it because they have never gotten over the hundreds of years of holy war
<prince-dari> Now that is BS.
<RedDragonX> 4no that's the truth
<prince-dari> That's just an assumption.
<spyro_master> 6no true actually
<RedDragonX> 4you just refuse to see it
<RedDragonX> 4nothing will change
<prince-dari> And it doesn't matter WHY they want it.
<RedDragonX> 4and those blind to it will see int ime
<RedDragonX> 4"time"
<spyro_master> 6to be honest let them selves sort their own bloddy mess out
<prince-dari> It is their land.
<prince-dari> That is what will never change.
<RedDragonX> 4Ummm yes it does.....they want it because it is the foundation of their religion so say
<prince-dari> In their eyes at lest.
<RedDragonX> 4and the Jews believe that as well
<prince-dari> least*
<RedDragonX> 4so welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven problem
<prince-dari> Yes, but it is not the Jews land.
<RedDragonX> 4it's a small piece of land that the Jews have built into a nation
<prince-dari> Nor was it Britains land to give.
<RedDragonX> 4and they deserve to have it
<spyro_master> 6It wasnt just britain
<spyro_master> 6it was teh UN
<spyro_master> 6actualluy
<prince-dari> If you feel that way, why do the Americans not give the Jews a piece of land that size.
<prince-dari> And boot out whoever is living in that piece of land.
<prince-dari> See how those people feel.
<spyro_master> 6because its not teh americans
<spyro_master> 6teh un has to decide
<prince-dari> That's not the point.
<prince-dari> The point is that they wouldn't do that,.
<RedDragonX> 4The land was divided for both parties. They had their chance to live together peacefully and the Arabs instead wanted to kill the Jews...what a surprise
<prince-dari> The point is that if you shouldn't take someone else's land from them.
<RedDragonX> 4and the Jews responded by freaking booting the Arabs themselves
<prince-dari> Yes, but it wasn't the Jew's land.
<prince-dari> You fail to see that.
<spyro_master> 6JUst cut the bloody country in half so they have both have a piece
<RedDragonX> 4The land has been contested for thousands of years
<RedDragonX> 4who the hell knows who it belongs to
<RedDragonX> 4the point is the Arabs refuse to stop
<RedDragonX> 4and they never will
<prince-dari> The Jews never lived there.
<spyro_master> 6and who cares
<RedDragonX> 4even when all the Jews want is to live in peace
<prince-dari> You didn't answer any of my questions.
<prince-dari> Because you can't.
<RedDragonX> 4that's all they have done besides the Arabs freaking attackign them
<prince-dari> Because should you answer them, the answer proves I'm right.
<RedDragonX> 4Yes I did you just can't freaking read into anything
<RedDragonX> 4It doesn't matter in the end because it's going to go on
<RedDragonX> 4and you think that it wont in the beginning
<prince-dari> So it is ok just to go in to someone's country, take their land and hand it over to someone else.
<RedDragonX> 4so you have already proved my poibnt
<RedDragonX> 4"point"
<prince-dari> So it is ok just to go in to someone's country, take their land and hand it over to someone else?
<prince-dari> Answer the question.
<RedDragonX> 4Well since the British mandate was created for both countries to share the Arabs are just as much to blame
<RedDragonX> 4they had their chance to make things right and they didn't
<RedDragonX> 4instead they wanted to kill
<prince-dari> It wasn't the Brittish's land to share out.
<prince-dari> So it is still wrong.
<prince-dari> And the Arabs are not to blame.
<prince-dari> Put it this way.
<spyro_master> 6well it was going on 4 a long time beofre britiain did
<prince-dari> Is it right for the Brittish to go into America, take a piece of land, and hand it over to the Jews?
<spyro_master> 6no because we know taht is wrong
<prince-dari> Just answer it yes, or no.
<prince-dari> Without avoiding the question.
<spyro_master> 6No
<RedDragonX> 4The land was divided by the UN when SEVERAL COUNTRIES had claim over it..they simply put out a simple solution. Share the land or don't share the land
<RedDragonX> 4and the Arabs didn't want that...they wanted Everything
<prince-dari> Yes, or no, RDX.
<prince-dari> The Israelis had no claim on.
<prince-dari> Just because their religion involves that country?
<prince-dari> BS
<prince-dari> Total BS.
<Spyrorocks> The land in question has religious value, I don't think you can compare it to any other land.
<prince-dari> So if my religion involves North America, I can say I have a claim on that, and take a piece of it?
<prince-dari> No.
<prince-dari> I can't.
<prince-dari> Total BS.
<Spyrorocks> I think thats an invalid comparison.
<prince-dari> In what way.
<RedDragonX> 4trying to pin that on a freaking example as so is just going into human morals as to avoid the problem at hand. The point is that the Israelis were given the land and the Arabs had a chance to freaking share it. And instead they are determined to go through genocide to get what they want. The whole point of this to begin with is that you believed the Arabs wouldn't do anything....they clearly will do something so you have already helped
<prince-dari> I am not talking about the problem at hand.
<prince-dari> I am proving that this is not the Arabs' fault.
<prince-dari> Because whatever the reason, you CANNOT justify going into someone ELSES'S country and taking some of THEIR land.
<prince-dari> You seem to ignoring that I am not talking about the problem at hand.
<prince-dari> I am talking about whose fault it is.
<Spyrorocks> Who's fault is it?
<prince-dari> Whoever decided to split the land between them.
<RedDragonX> 4you covered up the basic point of the debate which was that the Arabs were not going to do anything after the buffer is gone. And that Israel should instead be the o nes who are destroyed. You basically are saying that they deserve to be wiped out...well if I'm not mistaken the Arabs have been more into terrorism then the Jews ever had
<spyro_master> 6im going i can't bovered to listen to this any more
<Spyrorocks> Brittan?
<prince-dari> The point of the debate is who's fault this is.
<spyro_master> 6cya all
<prince-dari> You started talking about what the Arabs would do after the buffer was gone later.
<spyro_master> 6oh and nothing is goign to solved y pointing the blame
<spyro_master> 6so shut it
<spyro_master> 6bye XP
<prince-dari> I don't care how it can be solved, because for all I know, it can't.
<Spyrorocks> It won't be solved.
<RedDragonX> 4It will be solved through one factor
<RedDragonX> 4who will destroy who first
<Spyrorocks> Thats right
<RedDragonX> 4and Israel is certainly gung ho to defend their right to live
<prince-dari> It's too late, exactly, so there is no point in arguing about that, which is why I am proving that this is not the Arabs' fault.
<Spyrorocks> But until someone is destroyed it will continue.
<RedDragonX> 4and it's not Israels fault so it doesn't matter
<Spyrorocks> Who's fault is it?
<prince-dari> I never said it was.
<Spyrorocks> Whoever gave them the land?
<prince-dari> I said it was the fault of whoever split the land between them.
<RedDragonX> 4we have proved nothing except points that have no meaning
<Spyrorocks> Britian's fault?
<prince-dari> Basically.
<RedDragonX> 4the UN
<RedDragonX> 4everyone is at fault in this mess
<prince-dari> Well yeah, mainly the UN though.
<RedDragonX> 4but Isreal will kill
<RedDragonX> 4they are not afraid to do it
<prince-dari> Well, I enjoyed that, RDX.
<Spyrorocks> They have no problem annihilating the arabs.
<prince-dari> Thank you for the debate.
<RedDragonX> 4no problem
<RedDragonX> 4they have a right to live just like everyone else
<prince-dari> Gunna go watch TV for a bit.
<prince-dari> Cya later.
<RedDragonX> 4they would sooner kill themselves then let the Arabs do it
<prince-dari> Back.
<RedDragonX> 4wb
<prince-dari> Thanks.
<RedDragonX> 4I have the sudden urge to eat ice cream
<prince-dari> So eat ice cream.
<RedDragonX> 4we don't have any...
<RedDragonX> 4damn it
<prince-dari> Meh.
<prince-dari> :(
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<RedDragonX> 4I should have gone to the bank today
<prince-dari> BTW, I don't have anything against Americans.
<RedDragonX> 4It's fine man
<prince-dari> Just some of the things America has done.
<RedDragonX> 4Every nation has done things man
<RedDragonX> 4nobody is innocent
<RedDragonX> 4it's all a power struggle in the end
<prince-dari> Yeah...
<RedDragonX> 4but their are good people in this world
<RedDragonX> 4they are just much harder to find
<prince-dari> I wonder what will get us in the end.
<RedDragonX> 4who knows
<RedDragonX> 4the wonderful thing about life is its unpredictabilities
<prince-dari> Because for some reason, I doubt we'll make it all the way till the sun dies.
<RedDragonX> 4true
<RedDragonX> 4the world has simply evolved based on truly selfish reasons
<prince-dari> There was this program on once, about what would happen to the Earth if we all suddenly vanished.
<RedDragonX> 4it would be a better place
<prince-dari> After something like 300 years, all traces that we'd ever existed were gone, virtually.
<prince-dari> The last thing to go was the huge dam in America, I think.
<RedDragonX> 4Hoover dam
<prince-dari> I think so, yeah.
<RedDragonX> 4doesn't surprise me
<prince-dari> Because it needs virtually no maintanence and can almost run on its own.
<RedDragonX> 4well
<RedDragonX> 4if it does happen it happens
<RedDragonX> 4the most we can do is be the best people we can be every day
<RedDragonX> 4and live for what future we have
<RedDragonX> 4in the end I do see the destructive nature of some humans to be our undoing
<prince-dari> Yeah, probably, whatever it is, I think it is extremely likely it will be our own faults, rather than something natural, like a metior strike.
<RedDragonX> 4oh it will be
<RedDragonX> 4trust me
<prince-dari> Unless a meterior randomly destroys the Earth tomorrow :P However unlikely, there's always the chance.
<RedDragonX> 4that there is
<RedDragonX> 4but again who knows
<RedDragonX> 4I can only go with the law of averages
<prince-dari> The sad thing is, that I want to know what will happen, but I don't get to find out.
<RedDragonX> 4well
<RedDragonX> 4we don't know and most likely never will
<RedDragonX> 4so all we can do is live for today
<prince-dari> Doesn't make any difference when you're dead anyway.
<RedDragonX> 4and not worry about tomorrow
<prince-dari> Yeah, too true.
<RedDragonX> 4just be the best you can be
<RedDragonX> 4and what more do you have to worry about?
<RedDragonX> 4the only thing I would feel bad is for future generations
<prince-dari> I don't worry at all about what will happen, just am interested about the way things well wind up.
<prince-dari> will*
<prince-dari> Yeah, the world they inherit won't be much.
<RedDragonX> 4if anything
<RedDragonX> 4But I will be the best I can be for not only myself....but for those after me. I pray they don't have to grow up in a terrible world....but life will go the way we drive it....and that is down the wrong path now
<prince-dari> As you said, it is hard to find good people these days, and with the majority not being so, how can we take it down the right path?
<RedDragonX> 4we can't
<RedDragonX> 4unless human kind has an epiphony
<RedDragonX> 4which I highly doubt
<prince-dari> That would be interesting to see.
<RedDragonX> 4we are driven by selfish goals now
<RedDragonX> 4we no longer work for the better of all
<RedDragonX> 4but for the better of ourselves
<prince-dari> To suddenly see everything turn around for the better.
<RedDragonX> 4well I would love to see that
<RedDragonX> 4but we can only dream
<RedDragonX> 4all we have left is bettering ourselves
<RedDragonX> 4but even now that has fallen into decay
<prince-dari> Well I suppose everything has its time...Ours has to come to an end too...
<RedDragonX> 4every great empire falls
<RedDragonX> 4mainly through it's own means
<RedDragonX> 4"its'
<RedDragonX> 4humanity in general is no different
<prince-dari> Yeah, it almost always seems to be through its own means.
<RedDragonX> 4because people become selfish and governments become corrupt
<prince-dari> Such as the Romans spreading themselves out too thin. Got too greedy with land.
<RedDragonX> 4the best example is the Romans
<RedDragonX> 4they worked together to achieve a free and ethical society as a Republic
<RedDragonX> 4but upon transfer to the Empire they fell into disaray when power became an absolute
<RedDragonX> 4everyone wanted it for themselves
<RedDragonX> 4and eventually they collapsed through their own selfish desires
<RedDragonX> 4I'm an avid fan of history
<RedDragonX> 4and I like to see the lessons that it teaches us
<RedDragonX> 4every great empire is doomed to collapse
<RedDragonX> 4and it all begins when people begin working for the better of themselves rather then the better of all
<Aicebo> 13...
<prince-dari> There really isn't anything that lasts forever which is interesting.
<RedDragonX> 4nothing will last forever
<prince-dari> The only concept of something that lasts forever, which I can think of, if God.
<prince-dari> is*
<RedDragonX> 4but then again religion is also one of the many reasons why the world is how it is now
<prince-dari> Yeah...
<prince-dari> You would have thought that as their religions are against killing, it would stop them.
<RedDragonX> 4no
<RedDragonX> 4they have simply used religion as justification for their cause
<RedDragonX> 4and hence we shall always be divided
<RedDragonX> 4so long as humans disagree over who has claim over another
<prince-dari> So...If we wiped out all religion, it would be a better place? Lol...
<RedDragonX> 4perhaps it would be?
<RedDragonX> 4who knows
<prince-dari> When you think about it, religion does cause a lot of problems.
<RedDragonX> 4I'm pretty certain that if we were all under one religion things might be better to a degree
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<RedDragonX> 4at least we wouldn't be waging wars because we believe one cause is just over another

<RedDragonX> 4personal rights have now become the most dangerous weapon of all
<prince-dari> There's one problem that I don't know how it could be solved (Nothing major, quite minor really).
<prince-dari> Children having too much power.
<prince-dari> If a child spits on an adult in the street, what can the adult do, the adult can't clip the child round the ear, that would be called abuse, they can't even touch the child, they can't force them to go to a police station, and even if they did, what would the police do?
<prince-dari> Children have too much power.
<prince-dari> In earlier years adults had too much power, children were abused too much.
<prince-dari> We need a balance.
<prince-dari> But how do you get the balance?
<prince-dari> I don't see how you make a balance.
<RedDragonX> 4you no longer have the balance because people have been encouraged to act this way
<RedDragonX> 4in America 200 years ago
<RedDragonX> 4after the revolution
<RedDragonX> 4every American worked hard for a living
<RedDragonX> 4they all worked for the better of the nation
<RedDragonX> 4they were good and just people
<RedDragonX> 4and then the politics took effect over time
<RedDragonX> 4but now today
<RedDragonX> 4the average american doesn't go out and do a hard days work
<RedDragonX> 4they have no desire to better themselves
<RedDragonX> 4because they have been spoonfed their entire lives
<RedDragonX> 4and when one parent is spoonfed...what good do they have to pass on to their children?
<RedDragonX> 4the children become the adults
<RedDragonX> 4and they act the way they were brought up to act
<RedDragonX> 4which in today's world is not giving a damn
<prince-dari> Meh, there are so many problems, we are SO screwed.
<RedDragonX> 4no work ethic because they have been encouraged to be lazy

<RedDragonX> 4and hence the average person is a moron...and a jackass
<RedDragonX> 4hence why I am the conservative I am
<prince-dari> The thing is, we have created so many of the problems, dug ourselves into this hole, and now it's so big we can't climb out, there are no solutions to many of the problems.
<prince-dari> Well no solutions which are possible or likely to happen.
<RedDragonX> 4there is no solution except for people changing their ways
<RedDragonX> 4and the way things are now heading that's not going to happen
<prince-dari> Technology is also a problem in a way.
<RedDragonX> 4because the government has done nothing but encourage laziness and bad ethics for years
<RedDragonX> 4and yes Technology is a problem
<prince-dari> Our weapons are getting too advanced, too dangerous.
<RedDragonX> 4Technology is good in proportion
<RedDragonX> 4if we know how to wield it
<SpyroBot> 1,8New Topic Alert:2 "The Craziest" by Sammy The Dragon, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8714
<RedDragonX> 4which in today's world could mean our destruction
<RedDragonX> 4the same goes for the younger generations
<RedDragonX> 4their is a difference between knowing your limits on the internet for example
<RedDragonX> 4and just sitting there using it because you are addicted to it
<RedDragonX> 4You know....like the average kid who just comes home and sits online all day and do nothing to better themselves out of it
<RedDragonX> 4you have to admit that when things were like they were 200 years ago....kids actually had to go out and play.....in the air and sun.....things were better
<RedDragonX> 4the people were better that way
<prince-dari> So many people have nuclear weapons now...Should there be another world war, which is quite possible, will any of us survive?
<RedDragonX> 4without such distractions in our lives
<RedDragonX> 4even if you did survive
<prince-dari> The thing about technology, is that it's used mainly to make life easier for people.
<RedDragonX> 4you would have been better off dead
<prince-dari> And the easier you make it, the lazier they get.
<RedDragonX> 4yes but like I said.."technology in proportion"
<RedDragonX> 4if you know how to control it
<RedDragonX> 4then you are fine
<RedDragonX> 4but now people just use it for everything...and don't better themselves away from it
<RedDragonX> 4example...not going to the gym....instead choosing to sit inside on the internet
<RedDragonX> 4you have to know where the balance it
<RedDragonX> 4"is"
<RedDragonX> 4and you have to master it
<RedDragonX> 4technology is not a bad thing at all if you know your limits on it
<prince-dari> the problem with many things is finding the balance though.
<RedDragonX> 4yup
<RedDragonX> 4many are content to feel good by direct means
<RedDragonX> 4which would be sitting on the internet all day
<RedDragonX> 4doing nothing to better yourself...just enjoying it because it's simple
<RedDragonX> 4instead of enjoying something by bettering yourself as a whole
<RedDragonX> 4because people are too lazy to do it
<Aicebo> 13" well i could do that. or you could hear from those who posted themselves. i like to get personal." You'd think that the "top 10 posters" were celebrities or something :|

<RedDragonX> 4Aicebo isn't a very big fan lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10Spyro/Flame?
<prince-dari> SpyroXEmber: Ember annoys me so much in the game, but they'd be a good couple. 8.5/10

<Fresh_Blood> 10Have you ever actually seen any Spyro/Flame stories, Aicebo?
<Aicebo> 13Fresh_Blood: No.

<Prince-Dari> My God.
<Prince-Dari> That hurts.
<Prince-Dari> It's so bad, it hurts.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Ive never been good at jokes, sarcasm on the other hand...
<Catabatus> 10God en't got nothin' on yo ass
<Catabatus> 10Sarcasm is one of the higher forms of humor
<SpyroBot> 1,8New Topic Alert:2 "Do you have a major gripe about DotD?" by Archae, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8716
<Fresh_Blood> 10That it is, and being English Im inherently good at it
<Prince-Dari> Heheheh.
<Catabatus> 10Yes. Yes I do have a major gripe about DotD.
<Catabatus> 10I have a major gripe about the whole game.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Care to share?
<Catabatus> 10The whole trilogy.
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol
<Zephyr-kun> 6HEh
<Fresh_Blood> 10What's wrong with the trilogy?
<Catabatus> 10Everything.
<Prince-Dari> I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I just think people hate it because they replaced the old games with them.
<Prince-Dari> Although that's insomniac's fault, for dumping Spyro.
<Catabatus> 10Mary-sues, cliches, button-mashing
<Prince-Dari> It's not button mashing.
<Prince-Dari> It's too easy.
<Prince-Dari> :/
<Fresh_Blood> 10I hated the old spyro, far too americanised, no offense
<Catabatus> 10Yes. It. Is.
*Catabatus 10twitches
<Catabatus> 10.....
<Aicebo> 13How is it Americanized.
*Catabatus 10twitches again
<Aicebo> 13TLoS is more cliche and Americanized.
<Fresh_Blood> 10and what was with the skateboards?!
<Fresh_Blood> 10and the cocky attitude?
<Prince-Dari> All any game is pressing buttons.
<Prince-Dari> You can't say a game in which you press the buttons more often is worse.
<Prince-Dari> That's not a reason.
<Catabatus> 10Dari: No! Really? Wow... really?
<Prince-Dari> It's part of my point.
<Prince-Dari> Read everything I wrote and even you may understand.
*Catabatus 10headdesks
<Fresh_Blood> 10well the legend trilogy brought me back to Spyro, Id grown out of the older ones
<Fresh_Blood> 10cant stand to play them now
<Zephyr-kun> 6Most people seem to believe it is, Dari.
<Prince-Dari> How does pressing buttons more often make a game worse?
<Prince-Dari> It means it's faster paced and more fun to play.
<Fresh_Blood> 10thats not the point they're making
<Catabatus> 10Whenever you are able to press and random buttons in any combination and still manage to beat the enemy, I consider that button-mashing
<Catabatus> 10*any
<Fresh_Blood> 10they're saying you can win the game by mashing the buttons, like a five year old owuld
<RedDragonX> 4I like the new series
<Catabatus> 14Bah
<Fresh_Blood> 10here here
<Fresh_Blood> 10not here here to the 'bah'
<Fresh_Blood> 10the one above it
<Prince-Dari> ...Meh.
<Catabatus> 14Like I said: Mary-Sues, cliches, button-mashing
<Prince-Dari> A 5 year old can't play it, it's 7+ :P
<Catabatus> 14It isn't.... fun
<Prince-Dari> So you prefer Ember to Cynder...?
<Prince-Dari> EMBER?!?
<Fresh_Blood> 10How is it Mary sue?
<Prince-Dari> I mean come one.
<Catabatus> 14The gameplay is annoying as hell
<Prince-Dari> come on*
<Catabatus> 14No
<Catabatus> 14Elora
<Catabatus> 14I hate Ember and Cynder
<RedDragonX> 4oi
<RedDragonX> 4Elora was nothing
<Prince-Dari> Ember is still technically part of the old games.
<Catabatus> 14I support Spyro/Elora and... Spyro/Flame, thanks to Aicebo
<Fresh_Blood> 10I dont even know who elora is
<Prince-Dari> Elora sucks.
<Aicebo> 13:D
<RedDragonX> 4the faun
<Catabatus> 14Fresh_Blood: What a shame.
<Fresh_Blood> 10oh
<Prince-Dari> DragonxFaun = PHAIL
<Prince-Dari> DragonxDragon = Win
<Aicebo> 13Prince-Dari: Yup
<RedDragonX> 4that gave spyro a small peck on the forehead and is a romantic interest lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10I know, ember and flame...thats about it from the old games
<RedDragonX> 4supposedly
<Fresh_Blood> 10wow...really?
<Fresh_Blood> 10how strange
<Catabatus> 14A Hero's Tail and Enter the Dragonfly were abominations
<RedDragonX> 4eh
<Catabatus> 14They were no match for the original three
<RedDragonX> 4that they were
<Prince-Dari> ETD especially.
<Catabatus> 14No... match... at all....
<Prince-Dari> The loading screens...So horrible to remember...
<RedDragonX> 4gah
<RedDragonX> 4I sold that game
<RedDragonX> 4it was junk
<Fresh_Blood> 10i could probably play the very first game still, I dont think he talked much then
<Catabatus> 14And may I ask what is so bad about inter species couples?
<Prince-Dari> It's still in my house somewhere.
<Prince-Dari> I think I locked it away, after I couldn't sleep with it being in my room.
<Prince-Dari> It's scary.
<Fresh_Blood> 10you're talking to an Eragon/Saphira writer
<Catabatus> 14A lot of people who bash Elora/Spyro support Hunter/Bianca
<RedDragonX> 4I don't care about the inter species junk...if you like it that's fine lol....I just go with things that kinda make sense. And I didn't see anything to really back up the relationship that made sense
<RedDragonX> 4they pretty much just through it in htere
<RedDragonX> 4"there"
<Prince-Dari> But a dragon and a faun just isn't...
<Catabatus> 14Isn't...
<Catabatus> 14......?
<Prince-Dari> Their anatomies don't fit.
<Prince-Dari> It doesn't work.
<Fresh_Blood> 10The way I see it, The legend trilogy actually had a plot, the older games not so much
<Fresh_Blood> 10at least as far as I remember
<RedDragonX> 4it's different for some gamers
<Prince-Dari> <Fresh_Blood> you're talking to an Eragon/Saphira writer Yes, but you transform Eragon, so that doesn't really count as interspecies.
<Catabatus> 14At least the first three games had great gameplay
<RedDragonX> 4this argument will always go on since we have two different aspects
<Catabatus> 14Heh, true
<Fresh_Blood> 10i changed him back for a time
<Prince-Dari> Yeah, still.
<RedDragonX> 4I like both series for what they are
<Catabatus> 14I know there's no point in trying to "convert" anyone, but I like a nice debate once in a while
<Prince-Dari> The first game all I remember is that they just dump you in it.
<Prince-Dari> No one to talk to.
<RedDragonX> 4but I really don't go for the whole Mary sue argument on Cynder when Elora was just as useless lol...but that's just me
<Fresh_Blood> 10I vastly prefer the Legends series but I can still pay the very first game if only to chase those egg thieves...that was fun
<Catabatus> 14I suppose Spyro and Cynder are perfect for each other. After all, they're both Mary-Sues
<Fresh_Blood> 10How is Cynder a Mary Sue?
<Prince-Dari> The end of DotD was FAIL.
<Prince-Dari> Total FAIL.
<Fresh_Blood> 10or ASpyro?
<Prince-Dari> I have to say.
<Catabatus> 14Fresh_Blood: LOL. Are you serious?
<Prince-Dari> Dotd = EPIC PHAIL
<Catabatus> 14You - you're really serious?
<Zephyr-kun> 6Dari: Where exactly are you coming from with that, hmm?
<Prince-Dari> The ending.
<Prince-Dari> It was total crap.
<Prince-Dari> Does anyone mind if I use spoilers explaining how it is total crap?
<Prince-Dari> Anyone here?
<Fresh_Blood> 10They both have major character flaws and only saved the world because the 'ancestors' intervened
<Prince-Dari> You go through the whole frigging game for no reason, I mean, either way wouldn't the same thing have happened? Also, more characters should have died.
<RedDragonX> 4they left it open for future games
<Prince-Dari> This is supposed to some epic battle and hardly anyone dies.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Ithe same thing wouldnt have happened
<Zephyr-kun> 6Actually, no, the same thing would NOT have happened. More than likely, the remaining peices of the planet would have just crumbled, and everyone would've died
<Fresh_Blood> 10no one has yet explained to me why they're mary sues
<RedDragonX> 4oh I'm sure she is typing something
<RedDragonX> 4many are pretty dead set on this belief
<Fresh_Blood> 10who
<Catabatus> 14let's see... Dramatic past: CHECK
<Catabatus> 14 Hackneyed mannerisms:CHECK
<Fresh_Blood> 10i really see no basis for the belief, I go through a lot of trouble to avoid mary sues
<Zephyr-kun> 6I sorta see where they can call Cynder a Mary-sue, since she is what people would call emo or whatnot
<Catabatus> 14 Special Abilities: CHECK
<Catabatus> 14 Ostentatious: CHECK
<Prince-Dari> <Zephyr-kun> Actually, no, the same thing would NOT have happened. More than likely, the remaining peices of the planet would have just crumbled, and everyone would've died
<Prince-Dari> Explain.
<Prince-Dari> How the same thing not have happened?
<Fresh_Blood> 10ok one question, Hackneyed means?
<Zephyr-kun> 6Easy
<Catabatus> 14repeated too often
<Fresh_Blood> 10example
<Catabatus> 14Cynder's always so depressed because everyone supposedly hates her
<Catabatus> 14She's always saying about how she "doesn't belonog"
<Fresh_Blood> 10which of course would be expected, even in real life, and she isnt always depressed, that idea is a little cliched
<Catabatus> 14*belong
<Fresh_Blood> 10did it once as far as I can recall
<Catabatus> 14*snort*
<Zephyr-kun> 6Prince-Dari: I just explained. The planet would have crumbled. Spyro managed to keep it in a general area, and form what it looked like it will stay is it is. So yes, there is a difference. And I had given you an example up there.
<Prince-Dari> It wouldn't have crumbled.
<Prince-Dari> The ancestors would kill Malefor, then simply leave the world to be destroyed anyway?
<Prince-Dari> I think not.
<Catabatus> 14She never laughs or smiles (that one time in ANB doesn't count)
<Catabatus> 14Malefor got dragged underground... on a floating chunk of rock
<Zephyr-kun> 6I highly doubt the ancestors would be able to do much more than they had.
<Fresh_Blood> 10pleae, dont snort, I cant take that seriously. And I didnt see Spyro smile that much, and she did smile in DotD and TEN
<Fresh_Blood> 10by someone else
<Prince-Dari> Catabatus: It's the same thing
<Catabatus> 14I'm not even going to call it an island, since technically it isn't
<Prince-Dari> Catabatus: Either way, he's dead, or will never come back again.
<Prince-Dari> Zephyr-kun: So they can take down the most powerful force on the mortal world, but cannot stop a few cracks from spreading?
<Prince-Dari> BS
<Fresh_Blood> 10they didnt take him down
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> Technically they did.
<Catabatus> 14I still support my theory that Malefor is alive
<Catabatus> 14:P
<RedDragonX> 4if he is that would ruin it
<RedDragonX> 4I have had enough of Malefor
<Catabatus> 14Spyro: He's always talking about how it's his destiny to do... pretty much everything
<Fresh_Blood> 10Frankly I dont know exactly what happened to him so he probably is
<RedDragonX> 4as far as we know he is only imprisoned again
<Fresh_Blood> 10he's been told that by several people, and said it once I think
<Catabatus> 14Cynder: She's always moping about her past and all the terrible things she's done
<RedDragonX> 4didn't see him actually die
<Fresh_Blood> 10done that once at the start of TEN and again before confronting Malefor
<Catabatus> 14And when she isn't going through one of her "emo phases" she shows no emotion
<Catabatus> 14at all
<Prince-Dari> Why would Malefor be afraid if they were simply imprisoning him again?
<Prince-Dari> Because surely he can escape again.
<Prince-Dari> He would be more angry I would have thought.
<Catabatus> 14brb
<RedDragonX> 4I love how in depth you go into this lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10Nor does Spyro, personally I think that was bad casting, not character traits
<Prince-Dari> Lol, heheheh.
<Prince-Dari> And why would this be the "Dawn of the Dragons", if he was just imprisoned.
<Prince-Dari> Because if only imprisoned, he will escape again.
<Prince-Dari> And even while only imprisoned, we know he can wipe out almost every dragon in existence.
<Prince-Dari> So.
<RedDragonX> 4we don't know any of this unfortnetely lol
<RedDragonX> 4always fun to make assumptiosn
<Prince-Dari> Not really the "Dawn" of anything but more evil if imprisoned.
<Catabatus> 14They hardly thought out their character traits
<RedDragonX> 4"assumptions"
<Prince-Dari> RedDragonX: Oh, come on.
<Prince-Dari> He was imprisoned before, and had loads of minions.
<RedDragonX> 4What? lol
<Prince-Dari> How did he do that?
<RedDragonX> 4I'm only stating the truth :P
<Prince-Dari> If he did then, why can't he do it now?
<Fresh_Blood> 10and I though Mary Sues were meant to be over the top perfect characters?
<Catabatus> 14They are
<RedDragonX> 4As far as I know he isn't imprisoned in Convexity anymore
<RedDragonX> 4he is imprisoned in something in the center of the earth
<Fresh_Blood> 10The way I see it, they both have character flaws, arent all that powerful, and have reasonable pasts
<RedDragonX> 4but through Convexity...he could at least manipulate m inds
<RedDragonX> 4"minds"
<RedDragonX> 4and harner the inner darkness in people
<Prince-Dari> So the heat will destroy him.
<Prince-Dari> Simple.
<Prince-Dari> :)
<RedDragonX> 4who knows lol
<Catabatus> 14Spyro has to remind Cynder of how perfect she is... DEEP DOWN INSIDE. ISN'T THAT SWEET?
<RedDragonX> 4I don't know
<Prince-Dari> Or the pressure.
<RedDragonX> 4you don't know
<Catabatus> 14*ahem*
<Prince-Dari> And if he isn't destroyed, what's to stop him breaking out of the centre of the Earth?
<Prince-Dari> Except gravity
<Fresh_Blood> 10Explain that point again if you wouldnt mind
<RedDragonX> 4maybe the spirits of the guardians imprisoned him in an alternate reality lol
<Prince-Dari> And if gravity is too strong for him to pull against, he is stuck there forever.
<Prince-Dari> Either wya, I win.
<Prince-Dari> way*
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> Now that's quite unlikely.
<RedDragonX> 4I really don't care lol....I didn't even know I was the one arguing this
<RedDragonX> 4but in the end Idc as long as it's a good game
<Catabatus> 14Cynder thinks that everyone hates her, when the only two who don't trust her are Sparx and the Hermit
<Prince-Dari> It isn't a good game.
<Prince-Dari> Crappy ending.
<Prince-Dari> No point to the game at all.
<Catabatus> 14Sparx get's over it.. eventually
<RedDragonX> 4it
<RedDragonX> 4It's not good to YOU
<Prince-Dari> Might as well sit back and let the ancestors do it all.
<RedDragonX> 4not everyone is you lol
<Catabatus> 14So it's up to Spyro to tell her that she's perfect just the way she is
<Fresh_Blood> 10she doesnt think everyone hates her, she doesnt even once suggest that
<Catabatus> 14*cue "awww"
<Prince-Dari> Everyone should be me, then the world would be perfect, AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA (Joking :P)
<Catabatus> 14She does in the beginning of TEN
<Zephyr-kun> 6So you claim the game is crappy.... because of the ending? Hmm... yeah, whatever
<RedDragonX> 4he.....he....heh......what? lol
<RedDragonX> 4and no she doesn't
<RedDragonX> 4she only says that she can't stay here
<Prince-Dari> Yeah, the ending is what makes or breaks a film, book, game.
<RedDragonX> 4never directly does she say because everyone hates her
<Fresh_Blood> 10No, what she says is that she feels guilty about what she's done, that she doesnt deserve to be there. Not everyone hates her
<Catabatus> 14In fact, she runs off to find her "true destiny" after deciding that no one will except her
<Catabatus> 14I know that not everyone hates her
<RedDragonX> 4"accept"
<Catabatus> 14That was my point
<Prince-Dari> She says that she doesn't belong there.
<Prince-Dari> Her destiny is else where.
<RedDragonX> 4She does in the beginning of TEN
<RedDragonX> 4?
<Prince-Dari> So how does that mean no one will accept her?
<Fresh_Blood> 10she doesnt say no one will accept her
<RedDragonX> 4 you were claiming that his statement was fals
<RedDragonX> 4by saying that
<Prince-Dari> She just thinks that her place isn't there.
<Fresh_Blood> 10exactly
<Catabatus> 14OHH, OKAY. CYNDER PERFECT NAO
<Fresh_Blood> 10now thats just childish
<RedDragonX> 4and now you just randomly say something different lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10i thought we were having a reasoned argument
<Prince-Dari> <Zephyr-kun> So you claim the game is crappy.... because of the ending? Hmm... yeah, whatever <Prince-Dari> Yeah, the ending is what makes or breaks a film, book, game.
<Catabatus> 14We are
<Prince-Dari> Reapsond?
<RedDragonX> 4as far as I know you stated that she claimed everyone hated her....and you said that she stated that at the begining of TEN
<Prince-Dari> Respond?*
<RedDragonX> 4then you say that that I was trying to prove the exact opposite?
<RedDragonX> 4nah that doesn't stound right
<Catabatus> 14What? No.
<RedDragonX> 4read over what you just said lol
<Catabatus> 14My point was that not everyone hates her
<RedDragonX> 4you denied...then acknowledged his point
<Catabatus> 14She THINKS that everyone does
<RedDragonX> 4that's not what you said
<Catabatus> 14Oh, forget it
<Prince-Dari> Zephyr-kun: You think that the ending doesn't matter? In some ways it's the most important bit.
<Fresh_Blood> 10that was my point
<Catabatus> 14TLoS is screwed up
<Zephyr-kun> 6Dari: I walk around when I'm the comuter, so yes, I will e_e
<RedDragonX> 4haha
<RedDragonX> 4runs out of good ideas so she goes up to something more basic :P
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol i see that there's really no pointi in me continuing this argument
<Catabatus> 14Yeah
<Prince-Dari> Catabatus: No she doesn't
<Prince-Dari> She thinks she doesn't belong there.
<RedDragonX> 4h
<RedDragonX> 4"hm"
<Catabatus> 14And why doesn't she think she belongs there?
<Prince-Dari> Just because I don't think I belong in America (Eurgh America), does that mean that I think Americans hate me.
<Fresh_Blood> 10cos she feels guilty about what she did
<Prince-Dari> She can't bear to be around them.
<Prince-Dari> Because she remembers the pain she has caused them.
<Catabatus> 14No one cares
<Catabatus> 14Except for Sparx
<Prince-Dari> It doesn't matter if they care.
<Fresh_Blood> 10thats not the point
<Fresh_Blood> 10she cares
<Fresh_Blood> 10its her guilt
<Prince-Dari> She can't take it, knowing what she's done to them.
<Prince-Dari> She can't take how nice they are to her.
<Fresh_Blood> 10so she leaves
<Prince-Dari> Allowing them into their home, etc, etc.
<Prince-Dari> If you killed someone's child, by accident, how would you feel if they invited you to stay at their house.
<Prince-Dari> Could you>
<Catabatus> 14Meh. There's no point arguing with you LoS fanboys
<Prince-Dari> I doubt it.
<Prince-Dari> Answer my question.
<Zephyr-kun> 6It's not so much I don't think the ending doesn't matter as I don't think it makes the entire game crappy. While, yes, the ending is normally the most important bit, and people base their opinions on a game or movie on the ending a good bit, I'm not going to say I dislike a game simply because the ending is bad. If it's still fun, I will still like it, good ending or not.
<Prince-Dari> You would feel too guilty.
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol if you had good points then Id change my mind but you fail to put them acroos properly
<Prince-Dari> Zephyr-kun: The game, fair enough, you enjoy playing through it, but the plot, it ruins it.
<Catabatus> 14Oh, and you are defending your points so well
<Fresh_Blood> 10I am actually
<Prince-Dari> Answer my question please, Catabatus.
<Prince-Dari> Would you be able to?
<Catabatus> 14I would feel guilty about killing their child, but happy that they forgave me
<RedDragonX> 4he is defending his points lol
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> So you would go round their house, have tea and biscuits with them?
<Catabatus> 14Not at first, no
<RedDragonX> 4right now you are just pinning the blame on ..."LoS sucks in so many ways"....and "Fanboy accusations" lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10Now ,see if Id killed someones child I wouldnt be able to sit and eat with the family even if they did forgive me
*Catabatus 14is sick of people tryingt o defend their precious she-dragon
<Prince-Dari> Exactly.
<Catabatus> 14*trying to
<Prince-Dari> I agree, Fresh_Blood.
<Prince-Dari> I wouldn't be able to.
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<Fresh_Blood> 10i was actually defending Spyro too, you just shifted it to Cynder
<Zephyr-kun> 6If I thought a plotline was good in a movie, and then its ending was horrid, I would still think the plot is good, although the ending sucked.
<Fresh_Blood> 10and its dragoness, not She-dragon
<Prince-Dari> Let me give you an example.
<Zephyr-kun> 6There's a difference between the plot and events. A major difference
<Prince-Dari> I watched a film, through out the film, this guy is trying to find something.
<Catabatus> 14Oh, exuse me for not using the proper term
<Prince-Dari> He never finds it, and dies.
<Catabatus> 14Even though dragons don't exist
<Prince-Dari> What's the point of the film?
<Prince-Dari> It ruins it completely.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Not the point lol
<Prince-Dari> Why watch the film? There is no point in it.
<Catabatus> 14Dari: Yes.......
<Catabatus> 14And may I ask where you are going with this...?
<Fresh_Blood> 10Who?
<Zephyr-kun> 6The guy looking for whatever, obviously. And from what I've seen, you watch the film to watch whoever struggle to find whatever. And with that, the plot is still fine, it is simply lacking the event of him finding it.
<RedDragonX> 4wait...what are we talking about now?
<Catabatus> 14Who knows
<Catabatus> 14I say we drop the whole thing
<Blaze> 4hi
<Catabatus> 14It's pointless
<Catabatus> 14Hi
<Blaze> 4what thing?
<RedDragonX> 4no point in arguing something that you can't win lol
<Blaze> 4srry im really curious about stuff
<Zephyr-kun> 6Let me put it this way. You're saying that if you enjoy a movie or book or whatnot, and then the ending sucks, suddenly the whole thing will suck, whether or not you enjoyed it before?
<Zephyr-kun> 6And hi
<Fresh_Blood> 10fine, I'll drop it for now, give you time to think up better arguments but I will be back to finsh this!
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Zephyr-kun> 6Brb
<Prince-Dari> No, but there a loose ends.
<Catabatus> 14There is no finishing it
<RedDragonX> 4doesn't matter
<Fresh_Blood> 10every argument has an end
<Catabatus> 14It's an argument based on opinions
<Prince-Dari> There isn't much of a struggle in finding it either.
<RedDragonX> 4their will always be division
<Prince-Dari> He's just searching round this island.
<Prince-Dari> Small island.
<Fresh_Blood> 10exactly, so to win you must change someone's opinion
<Prince-Dari> Then is put inside some wooden thing and is burnt to death.
<Catabatus> 14Not necessarily
<Fresh_Blood> 10depends on what the opinion is based on
<Blaze> 4Zephyr-kun: well Zephry i think your right, having a stuipid ending/climax is what your waiting for at the end, and having one sucks make the whole activity book movie thing suck
<RedDragonX> 4-.-
<Catabatus> 14Well, I'll tell you this: You aren't changing my opinion.
<Catabatus> 14And I know that I'm not changing yours.
<Prince-Dari> Actually, that's agreeing with me, Blaze.
<Fresh_Blood> 10i can damn well try lol
<RedDragonX> 4lmao
<Catabatus> 14This went from a nice debate to utter chaos
<Blaze> 4kk dari
<RedDragonX> 4persistant as always lol
<RedDragonX> 4it wasn't chaos lol
<RedDragonX> 4I found it quite amusing lol
<Catabatus> 14You would
<Catabatus> 14:P
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Prince-Dari> What I find amusing is that we have multiple arguments going on at the same time.
<Prince-Dari> Completely different arguments, coming from the same one topic.
<Blaze> 4me 2
<Fresh_Blood> 10I'll be coming back for more, thats for sure, that was fun
<Zephyr-kun> 6That is quite amusing
<Catabatus> 14Yeah, that added to the chaos
<RedDragonX> 4yeah....
<Catabatus> 14Of course, we all interpret things differently
<Catabatus> 14Thus creating opinions...
<Fresh_Blood> 10it helps to know who you were arguing with
<Prince-Dari> Now I should bring up that debate about logic I had with the other guy.
<Blaze> 4FORTION SMART COOKIIE CATABATUS DUDE!!!
<RedDragonX> 4man enough with the logic lol
<Prince-Dari> It was that in certain situations, logic can be opinionated.
<Prince-Dari> I dare you to disagree.
<Fresh_Blood> 10how so
<Prince-Dari> Well.
*Catabatus 14is blown off her feet by the sheer force of Blaze's statement
*Blaze 4runs away screaming FORTION SMART COOKIIE CATABATUS DUDE!!!
<Catabatus> 14...
<RedDragonX> 4gah
<RedDragonX> 4I hate two reds
*Catabatus 14hopes Ignitus232 a.k.a. Ari a.k.a. Cyril_the a.k.a. Terrador_earth comes on
*Blaze 4runs away screaming FORTION SMART COOKIIE CATABATUS DUDEet!! that better
<RedDragonX> 4why so we can make fun of them lol
<Catabatus> 14That's worse
<RedDragonX> 4for being a complete moron
<RedDragonX> 4and thinking that she is a dragon lol
<Catabatus> 14RedDragonX: Yep
<RedDragonX> 4yeah that was pretty fun
*Catabatus 14grins evilly
<RedDragonX> 4I have to admit
<Catabatus> 10Is... is teal open?
<Fresh_Blood> 10no
<RedDragonX> 4I don't think so
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol
<Prince-Dari> For example, if you go to a blind date show, you hear certain pieces of information about 3 different people, now, you don't have all the information on each person, and you have to come to a logical conclusion, well, the logical conclusion on the information given might be to choose person A, for one person, but it may be person B for another, so it is your opinion on the given data, thus making the logic opinion
<RedDragonX> 4niether is red -.-
<Zephyr-kun> 6Neither is purple >: D
<Blaze> 4how many people are doing the red text color?
<Prince-Dari> How anyone could argue MY logic there, I don't get.
<RedDragonX> 4logic is based around human opinions lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10its not opinionated, some just interpret it differently
<Prince-Dari> Yet he argued for THREE hours.
<Catabatus> 14Heh
<RedDragonX> 4I AM
<RedDragonX> 4Red be my color :D
<Blaze> 4that all
<Prince-Dari> Yes, but it is your opinion on the given data.
<Blaze> 4alright lets try
<RedDragonX> 4I banish everyone from the color red
<Blaze> 4...
<Prince-Dari> How you interpret it, is you opinion on the data.
<Blaze> 12Blue?
<Fresh_Blood> 10There is only one truely logical choice. To you everyone elses is illogical.
<RedDragonX> 4blue is good
<Zephyr-kun> 6I can agree with that, Dari
<Catabatus> 14Quote: 20:32	Catabatus	Of course, we all interpret things differently Thus creating opinions...
<Blaze> 12not taken?
<Prince-Dari> There is only one logical choice in a situation where you have all the data.
<Fresh_Blood> 10On second thoughts I retract my opinion.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Logic is opinionated
*Blaze 12runs away screaming FORTION SMART COOKIIE CATABATUS DUDEet!!
<RedDragonX> 4Human logic I believe is based around your own personal opinions....and your own personal experiences...how you interpret something and the right way to deal with it is having logic about something...so thus you must have personal experiences to asertain the appropriate logic to deal with a situation
*Catabatus 14hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "babe" and "gal"
<Prince-Dari> He seemed to think, that in situations where you do not have all the data, you have an opinion the data that is given, and create the rest of the data from that, meaning that there is only one logical answer.
<Fresh_Blood> 10personal motives also play a part so it is therefore opinionated and specific to each person
<Prince-Dari> Yet it is your opinion on the given data, so your opinion equates to the logical answer, really.
<Blaze> 12runs away screaming FORTION SMART COOKIIE REDDRAGON DUDE!!
<Fresh_Blood> 10there's mathamatical logic and human logic
<Fresh_Blood> 10human logic is opinion, mathamatical is statistical
<Blaze> 12stop making smart
<RedDragonX> 4why? lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10I cant help it
<Prince-Dari> Catabatus: I've just filed away all that for further use at later times.
<RedDragonX> 4what's wrong with a smart argument
<Blaze> 12djfnsdjfnjsk

<Zephyr-kun> 6I win ^_^
<Prince-Dari> Blaze: Banned.
<Prince-Dari> Blaze: I think SR would ban you.
*Catabatus 14crosses her fingers

*Blaze 12kicks catabatuses leg
<Prince-Dari> Hmm...
<Fresh_Blood> 10you know that children crave attention right?
<Fresh_Blood> 10by speaking to it you're only encouraging it
<Blaze> 12Catabatus+Blaze=ATOM BOMB FORMULA!
<Prince-Dari> A retard, as you put it, someone who has been born mentally ill.
<RedDragonX> 4hm
<Prince-Dari> The word gay, which you seem to think is an insult, is the word for someone who is a homosexual.
<Blaze> 12your a homo
<RedDragonX> 4that's not the insulting term at all
<Catabatus> 14....wow
<RedDragonX> 4and you're going to be banned
<Prince-Dari> Should you retain these facts, I shall be greatly surprised, as you are an idiot to the extreme.

<Yahoo> Kieran get fucked
<Yahoo> Apparently you had an argument with Reddragon

<Kjakings> 7I hate it when people don't get the difference
<Yahoo> Spyro Master told me it was an argument

<Aicebo> 13RedDragonX.
<RedDragonX> 4we were just looking for a topic to debate Dari lol
<RedDragonX> 4and you are usually pretty good at finding those lol
<Terminator> My underwear is too tight =O
<Fresh_Blood> 10Would you be called on in case of war?
<Fresh_Blood> 10What's IT'd?
<Fresh_Blood> 10I think this thing keeps freezing on me
<RedDragonX> 4Yes I would be called upon
<RedDragonX> 4I can be called on any day
<RedDragonX> 4and IT means Intensive Training
<Prince-Dari> I've never understand how America can have a base on Cuba, when America and Cuba have no relations at all. They hate each other.
<Prince-Dari> understood*
<Aicebo> 13lol
<RedDragonX> 4because of the Cuban missle crisis lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10America wants to build a missile base in Europe!!! Build it on yoru own land!!! lol
<RedDragonX> 4well unfortuntely all that runs through the UN
<Prince-Dari> If America does that, I will burn that base to the ground.
<RedDragonX> 4so if Europe has a problem with it then say something lol
<Prince-Dari> UK isn't part of Europe.
<Prince-Dari> :P
<Fresh_Blood> 10We have, but youve already got permission lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10YES IT IS!!!
<Prince-Dari> Nah.
*Terminator is blown away by force of Fresh_blood's statement
<Fresh_Blood> 10It damn well is
<RedDragonX> 4he said Europe lol
<RedDragonX> 4not Uk
<Prince-Dari> We don't use the Euro.
<Fresh_Blood> 10AND?!!
<Prince-Dari> Europe sucks.
<Prince-Dari> The UN sucks.
<Prince-Dari> They put us through stupid regulations.
<Fresh_Blood> 10We're still apart of Europe, and you call yourself English
<Prince-Dari> We are better off by ourselves.
<Fresh_Blood> 10hmph
<RedDragonX> 4haha
<Terminator> inferior human organs!
<RedDragonX> 4good luck with that
<Prince-Dari> And they take everything out of our hands.
<RedDragonX> 4England being an island nation
<RedDragonX> 4where the hell you gonna get your resources from lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10Africa, Australia, America etc etc etc
<Fresh_Blood> 10New Zealond
<RedDragonX> 4which pretty much all run through the UN lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10land*
<Rurik> 4I thought Kja was on for a sec
<Fresh_Blood> 10Ah, but the UN isnt the EU
<RedDragonX> 4nah
<RedDragonX> 4Dari took his color lol
<Prince-Dari> Kill Blair.
<RedDragonX> 4If you ruin your relationship with the nations around you who is gonna deal with you lol
<Prince-Dari> Made us sign that stupid treaty.
<Prince-Dari> :/
<Fresh_Blood> 10Isnt that what your country has basically done?
<Prince-Dari> I don't want Europian ties.
<RedDragonX> 4lol
<RedDragonX> 4Blair was freaking stupid....
<Fresh_Blood> 10and a kiss up
<Prince-Dari> He was Bushes poodle. :/
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol true
<RedDragonX> 4and which country were you talking about
<Fresh_Blood> 10Brown isnt that much better either
<Prince-Dari> Someone has to be pretty stupid to be the pet of Bush.
<Fresh_Blood> 10Or just a really really big kiss up
<RedDragonX> 4I'm not in the mood to deal with freaking Bush bashing right now
<PARANOiA> 14Prince-Dari: What did you do?
<Fresh_Blood> 10he followed him to Iraq for gods sake
<PARANOiA> 14Oh
<PARANOiA> 14Nevermind
*Prince-Dari burns the treaty of Lisbon.
<Prince-Dari> Piece of crap.
*Prince-Dari burns Blair.
<RedDragonX> 4doesn't matter since our economy is not going to be royally fucked for the next 50 years
<RedDragonX> 4and I get to help pay for it...yay
<Fresh_Blood> 10We'll all get to help pay for it
<RedDragonX> 4well at least I'm not in the freaking stock market lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10true lol
<Prince-Dari> Hahaha.
<RedDragonX> 4those poor bastards will be jumping out of windows again
<Fresh_Blood> 10dont want another wallstreet
<Prince-Dari> Yeah.
<Prince-Dari> Loooool.
<Prince-Dari> God.
<RedDragonX> 4that's why you don't put money where you can't see it
<Prince-Dari> So you don't put money in the bank either? :P
<Prince-Dari> Oh wait.
<Prince-Dari> O_o
<Fresh_Blood> 10cant see your money in a bank....
<RedDragonX> 4okay my bad....don't invest your money in something you can't see is that better lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10lol yes
<RedDragonX> 4christ it's simple
<RedDragonX> 4if you want to handle money right
<Fresh_Blood> 10I earn 1% on my money in the bank
<RedDragonX> 4use one bank....one debit card....and deal all in cash
<Prince-Dari> Buy gold with your money.
<Prince-Dari> Gold is always going up in price.
<RedDragonX> 4and gold is actually a good idea
<RedDragonX> 4that shit is going up
<Fresh_Blood> 10for now
<Fresh_Blood> 10but it is a safe investment
<RedDragonX> 4I don't invest in anything
<RedDragonX> 4I keep my money where I can see it lol.....and keep it safe by my own means
<Fresh_Blood> 10I used to keep mine in my safe...now its in the bank earning me 1p a month
<RedDragonX> 4freaking credit cards lol
<RedDragonX> 4and people wonder why they are in debt
<Fresh_Blood> 10i use debit cards
<RedDragonX> 4I use one debit card
<Prince-Dari> Americans are invading...
<RedDragonX> 4that's it
<Fresh_Blood> 10well yeah, one debit card
<Prince-Dari> First they want to build a missile base, but it won't stop there.
<Aicebo> 13...
<RedDragonX> 4pssst go talk to Obama lol
<RedDragonX> 4he already promised everything and can't deliever...I'm sure he would be glad to help lol
<Prince-Dari> Then they'll start building army bases around the UK
<Fresh_Blood> 10He'll be assassinated soon
<Prince-Dari> Then when they have enough people, they'll take over completely.
<RedDragonX> 4his approval rating is already sinking like a stone lol
<Prince-Dari> How long do you think before he gets assassinated?
<RedDragonX> 4well
<Fresh_Blood> 10before the end of his first term
<Prince-Dari> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TiQCJXpbKg
<Aicebo> 13blah.
<RedDragonX> 4seeing as how I'm a member of the military that's not something I can really talk about
<Prince-Dari> Lol.
<Aduro> 3If obama is assassinated....
<Aduro> 3then there will be riots....complete and total hell
<Fresh_Blood> 10doubtful
<Prince-Dari> Rioting against what?
<RedDragonX> 4The world is going to end up like that anyways
<Prince-Dari> I don't think so.
<Aicebo> 13brb
<RedDragonX> 4and yeah I doubt anything big would happen
<Prince-Dari> My last message wasn't aimed at you, by the way, RDX.
<Fresh_Blood> 10I'm moving to the moon, no one owns that yet, no taxes
<RedDragonX> 4In terms of how we meet our end.....if the world erupts into a freaking explosion of anger because of our own selfish needs....hence WW3 would erupt...which means complete breakdown of society since we would pretty much kill everyone anyways...
<RedDragonX> 4what do you think people would do? lol
<Prince-Dari> I'm going to hide undergruond?
<Prince-Dari> underground*
<RedDragonX> 4well I can just see the entire world going nuts if Necleur holocaust is upon us
<RedDragonX> 4"nuclear"
<Fresh_Blood> 10It wont come to that
<RedDragonX> 4however you spell it
<Fresh_Blood> 10none of us are that stupid
<RedDragonX> 4not us
<RedDragonX> 4but you have no idea how many stupid people are in this world
<Fresh_Blood> 10it'd be mass suicide
<RedDragonX> 4any of them would love to launch a nuke just for the fuck of it
<Fresh_Blood> 10on a global scale
<RedDragonX> 4this world is already at risk of that
<Aicebo> 13back
<RedDragonX> 4everyone has nukes now
<RedDragonX> 4all it takes is one little push
<Aicebo> 13bah
<Fresh_Blood> 10wouldnt do them any good though, a nuke is only good if it can get you something
<RedDragonX> 4and who knows what could happen
<Prince-Dari> Nukes are such a bad idea. :/
<Prince-Dari> Why does anyone need a weapon so powerful?
<Fresh_Blood> 10They're unusable weapons
<RedDragonX> 4You know their are people who really are sick enough to want that shit lol
<RedDragonX> 4well let's go back to WW2 lol
<Aduro> 3weapons of mass destruction are threats
<RedDragonX> 4we wanted to end the war quickly and let the Japanese know that we could kill them at any time
<RedDragonX> 4and they ended it pretty quickly
<Prince-Dari> I always wonder how long it will be before some American that's in charge of a nuclear submarine goes crazy and starts using its weapons.
<RedDragonX> 4now everyone has access to them now lol
<Fresh_Blood> 10two bombs was a bit unnecessery though
<RedDragonX> 4Dari go watch the movie Crimson Tide
<RedDragonX> 4it was global war FB
<Prince-Dari> FB>
<Prince-Dari> FB?*
<RedDragonX> 4the definition of total war is to use every single resource at your disposal to kill the enemy
<Fresh_Blood> 10But still, one bomb would have got the job done
<Fresh_Blood> 10you werent trying to wipe them out
<Aicebo> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ysQE9MKaz0 these girls have no lives. Oh well.
<RedDragonX> 4and maybe one freaking ship destroyed at pearl harbor could have told us to back off?
<RedDragonX> 4they wanted the war over
<RedDragonX> 4they didn't take any chances
<Fresh_Blood> 10And wiping out one city in one second is different to one ship in several minutes
<Prince-Dari> At least Obama has said that Guantanimo bay is going to be shut down.
<Prince-Dari> One good thing at least.
<RedDragonX> 4They wanted to end the war and they made their point...arguing about why they dropped two is pretty pointless. They wanted to get the point across
<RedDragonX> 4shutting down Gittmo is a bad idea
<RedDragonX> 4unless they find a place for all these prisoners
<Prince-Dari> Holding people who they only suspect are terrorists is wrong.
<RedDragonX> 4which they have yet to do
<Fresh_Blood> 10I know, its pointless to debate now, that's just my opinion on the matter
<Prince-Dari> Holding people who they only suspect are terrorists is wrong.
<Fresh_Blood> 10open up alcatraz
<Prince-Dari> They don't even get a trial.
<RedDragonX> 4more then the vast majority of people in that prison have been involved in terrorist acts...or suspected of it yet refuse to talk
<Prince-Dari> Americans simply suspect them, so they lock them up and throw away the key.
<RedDragonX> 4but we don't have a place to put them
<Prince-Dari> It's disgusting.
<RedDragonX> 4it's disgusting that we are trying to defend against the overall threat of terrorism by seizing those who refuse to talk?
<Prince-Dari> And locking up for life? Yes.
<RedDragonX> 4if they refuse to talk then they just might know something
<Prince-Dari> You don't know if they've done anything.
<Prince-Dari> So?
<RedDragonX> 4and that's enough to put them in the risk factor
<Fresh_Blood> 10paranoia simply
<Prince-Dari> That's life, there's always risks.
<RedDragonX> 4and yet they might have
<RedDragonX> 4so it can go either way
<RedDragonX> 4but if they suspect someone
<Prince-Dari> So something is a risk and America barges in and blows it up.
<Prince-Dari> Sounds about right.
<RedDragonX> 4so you are going to accuse us of acting badly because we want Americans safe?
<RedDragonX> 4any nation will do that if they get the chance
<Prince-Dari> Hah.
<Prince-Dari> That's going extreme. They might as well lock everyone up, everyone is always a risk.
<Fresh_Blood> 10I believe this topic is starting to border on the line of offence here
<Prince-Dari> Any crazy American can get hold of a gun.
<Prince-Dari> There's a risk they might go off shooting people
<RedDragonX> 4Every time you need a fall back you go onto nations as a whole
<Prince-Dari> So all Americans should be locked up?
<RedDragonX> 4every freaking person in that prison has been a suspect
<Prince-Dari> It's not a fall back.
<RedDragonX> 4they are in the risk facotr
<RedDragonX> 4'factor"
<RedDragonX> 4they might know something
<RedDragonX> 4and they wont talk
<Prince-Dari> Everyone is a risk.
<Prince-Dari> You can't just lock them up.
<RedDragonX> 4so we are right to assume that they do
<Prince-Dari> No you aren't.
<RedDragonX> 4that's a risk we will gladly take
<Prince-Dari> You shouldn't lock people up without fair trial.
<RedDragonX> 4and I don't care so much about closing the prison
<RedDragonX> 4the problem is
<RedDragonX> 4they don't know what to do with them
<Aduro> 3wow...
<Fresh_Blood> 10what if they dont actually know anything?
<Prince-Dari> America simpley believes it can do what it wants.
<RedDragonX> 4and they have yet to give a response
<Prince-Dari> They should release them.
<Prince-Dari> Most are innocent.
<RedDragonX> 4ummm no
<Prince-Dari> Uhh, yes.
<Terminator> ;)
<RedDragonX> 4um no
<RedDragonX> 4that's freaking insane
<Fresh_Blood> 10what if they dont actually know anything?
<RedDragonX> 4I don't know where you get this innocent shit....most of them are all freaking guilty
<RedDragonX> 4they have been arrested and sentenced their when caught fighting against Americans
<RedDragonX> 4and in the end it doesn't matter because guess what
<Prince-Dari> They have not been proven guilty.
<RedDragonX> 4when America does nothing
<RedDragonX> 4everyone in the world complains that we dont' care
<RedDragonX> 4when we do do something
<RedDragonX> 4everyone complains that we are murderers
<Prince-Dari> If America doesn't poke its nose where it doesn't belong, people leave it alone.
<Prince-Dari> But America has to interfere.
<Prince-Dari> No one wants America to do anything.
<RedDragonX> 4and pretty much most of the time we poke our noses because someone complains about it first
<RedDragonX> 4and we were attacked first
<Fresh_Blood> 10But thats the role your nation has claimed on itself, there;s no point in sitting here arguing about things that us as individuals can not and never will change
<Prince-Dari> Hah.
<RedDragonX> 4these facotors are far out of our hands
<Prince-Dari> You go into countries that don't want you there.
<RedDragonX> 4goverments are governments
<RedDragonX> 4we go into countries that would sooner harm those around them then help people
<Prince-Dari> But the fact that you support that BS makes me angry.
<Fresh_Blood> 10To put it simply every country is ruled by an indiot, can we at least agree on that?
<RedDragonX> 4and the fact you are a freaking la la liberal that can't see the truth in matters makes me angry
<Prince-Dari> I suppose.
<RedDragonX> 4so what have we proved?
<Prince-Dari> It isn't the truth.
<RedDragonX> 4yes it is
<Fresh_Blood> 10none of us have proved anything except for the fact we cant remove ourselves from the argument
<RedDragonX> 4just like the fucking Israelis and Arabs lol
<RedDragonX> 4and you can't see it because you are so hell bent on "proof"
<Prince-Dari> You think it is right for America to lock up people it simply suspects of stuff, for the rest of their lives?
<RedDragonX> 4I would rather see that then have them free and then do something which is a huge possibility
<Prince-Dari> How can you expect me to think that to be right.
<RedDragonX> 4it was their fault for not talking in the first place
<Prince-Dari> They aren't given a trial.
<Prince-Dari> Where is their chance to talk.
<Fresh_Blood> 10How can you telll the diffeence between the ones that dont talk and the ones that dont know anything?
<Prince-Dari> The Americans don't listen.
<Prince-Dari> They just lock them up, because they suspect them.
<RedDragonX> 4if they don't talk what do you think we will do?
<RedDragonX> 4we can't just let you go
<RedDragonX> 4we found you engaging in activities that could harm this country
<RedDragonX> 4we have eevery right to detain you
<RedDragonX> 4but you wouldn't sit there and let me insult Britain just like I can't sit here and listen to you insult America
<Prince-Dari> It's not even in America.
<Prince-Dari> What Americans do with people they find doing things in their own country, fine.
<RedDragonX> 4we have every right to suspect them. If they don't talk that gives us every right to assume that they know something we don't and that puts them in the risk facotr
<Prince-Dari> But that isn't even damn well in America.
<Prince-Dari> They have no right to be there.
<RedDragonX> 4we are there for a reason which I said earlier
<RedDragonX> 4the Cuban Crisis has forced us to keep a presence there
<Prince-Dari> America sees terrorists where there are none.
<RedDragonX> 4we don't exactly find Communist countries american friendly
<RedDragonX> 4and how do you know there are not terrorists there?
<Fresh_Blood> 10I think communisim isnt all that bad
<RedDragonX> 4there are terrorists in every single country
<RedDragonX> 4and many of them would be glad to freaking launch a nuke to display their ideals
<Fresh_Blood> 10I still doubt that
<Fresh_Blood> 10scare maybe but never use
<Prince-Dari> America is paranoid about terrorists.
<RedDragonX> 4do you not see how sick some people are today?
<RedDragonX> 4and we are not suppose to be?
<RedDragonX> 4okay
<RedDragonX> 4so we sit here
<RedDragonX> 4do nothing abotu it
<RedDragonX> 4then when they do attack us
<RedDragonX> 4it's okay to do something
<RedDragonX> 4but wait...we do
<RedDragonX> 4then the world calls us murderes again
<RedDragonX> 4for actually trying to act upon it
<Prince-Dari> Terrorists rarely attack America.
<RedDragonX> 4then the whole thing starts all over again
<RedDragonX> 4Terrorists attack everywhere...and I'm sorry if the whole 9-11 thing doesn't sit well with me
<Prince-Dari> And by going into Iraq, they just made more terrorists for themselves to be attacked by.
<Prince-Dari> 9-11 was a while ago.
<RedDragonX> 4The terrorists were always going to be there...they are operating on a global scale
<Terminator> Prince-Dari: that's wangernumb!
<RedDragonX> 4they attacked the towers twice
<RedDragonX> 4and succeeded the second time by far
<RedDragonX> 4and ever since 9-11 there have been no attacks on us
<Prince-Dari> Exactly.
<RedDragonX> 4because we have stepped up the fight against them
<Prince-Dari> Yes.
<RedDragonX> 4and that's where it matters
<Prince-Dari> And got loads more Americans killed.
<RedDragonX> 4because we keep our people safe
<Prince-Dari> Well done.
<Fresh_Blood> 10THIS IS GETTING TIRESOME, NEITHER OF YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS SO WHY ARGUE, IT'S BLOODY POINTLESS!!!!
<Prince-Dari> You've achieved killing thousands more Americans.
<Prince-Dari> Rather than have very few Americans killed in America.
<RedDragonX> 4more American sget freaking killed in car accidents every year then in the military
<RedDragonX> 4and through various other reasons
<Prince-Dari> Not more in one year than died in Iraq.
<RedDragonX> 4this isn't even a war
<RedDragonX> 4it's a police action
<RedDragonX> 4and yes more in one year
<RedDragonX> 4would you like the figures?
<Prince-Dari> Fine.
<RedDragonX> 4 24,000 Americans die each year in car accidents
<RedDragonX> 4on average
<Prince-Dari> http://www.antiwar.com/casualties/
<RedDragonX> 4casualties and deaths are completely different
<RedDragonX> 4and I can go into various other factors that kill poeple in America
<RedDragonX> 4car accidents are just the largest one
<RedDragonX> 4and that's each year
<Prince-Dari> Terrorists being one of the smallest.
<Prince-Dari> Yet America is so paranoid about terrorists.
<RedDragonX> 4but the ones that shouldn't happen
<Prince-Dari> I think its mainly that they like going trigger happy and killing people they assume are terrorists.
<RedDragonX> 4because we did nothing wrong to die over fanatical religious beliefs
<Aduro> Finally....
<RedDragonX> 4because we have no right to protect our country right?
<RedDragonX> 4oh yeah I forgot we are not suppose to do anything
<RedDragonX> 4nevermind
<Fresh_Blood> 10Aduro, dont expect much, they arent even aware of us anymore
<RedDragonX> 4and I am aware of you lol
<RedDragonX> 4sorry
<Prince-Dari> Well why would terrorists have reason to attack America if they didn't intefere with things?
<Prince-Dari> They wouldn't.
<RedDragonX> 4did I not just say religious beliefs?
<RedDragonX> 4ummmm terrorists hate us
<RedDragonX> 4and you know what the vast majority of them yell before they die
<RedDragonX> 4ALLLLLAAAHHHHHH!!!!!
<RedDragonX> 4then they blow themeslves up
<RedDragonX> 4good for fucking you
<RedDragonX> 4you get 72 virgins for blowing yourslef up
<RedDragonX> 4and going to see Allah
<RedDragonX> 4and taking innocents with you
<RedDragonX> 4thats what they are brought up to believe
<RedDragonX> 4and that's how they are trained
<RedDragonX> 4that killing yourself in the name of Allah is the greatest glory you can ever have
<Aduro> 3....
<Aduro> 3talk about your heated debates
<RedDragonX> 4and they want to install fear in our nation by taking innocents with them
<RedDragonX> 4that's the whole point of terrorism
<RedDragonX> 4they want us to fear them
<Prince-Dari> Well there would be VERY few deaths from terrorists if America didn't intefere.
<RedDragonX> 4and not do anything against them
<Prince-Dari> That's what the terrorists hate most.
<Prince-Dari> America interefering with them
<RedDragonX> 4so you are saying if we just sat here and did nothing that terrorists would no longer attac k
<RedDragonX> 4you are just as blind as Raidon lol
<Prince-Dari> They wouldn't have reason to.
<Aduro> 3I don't know why...but I have to randomly insert myself into the conversation
<RedDragonX> 4mister freaking "if we sit here we will be out of Nuclear war'
<RedDragonX> 4what a freakign moron
<Prince-Dari> They wouldn't.
<Fresh_Blood> 10what is it the terrorists actually want?
<Terminator> warm
<RedDragonX> 4Terrorists always have reason...we didn't do anything before 9-11 did we?...they attacked us because freakign Osama Bin Fucking ladin see's Americans as the greatest disease
<RedDragonX> 4Terrorists want to install their radical beliefs in others through fear
<Prince-Dari> The newest recruits, thanks to America going to Iraq want America out of Iraq.
<RedDragonX> 4They were recrutinga anyways...and they always would have!
<RedDragonX> 4they attacked the towers two times
<RedDragonX> 4the first for no reason at all
<RedDragonX> 4the second because they wanted to fucking send a statement that we were a disease that doesn't deserve to live
<Prince-Dari> They wouldn't have had so many recruits.
<Prince-Dari> So many that hate America.
<Fresh_Blood> 10I cant cope with any religion whatsoever....appart from maybe budahisim
<RedDragonX> 4The Terrorists would still be recruting no matter what...and they would still be attacking
<RedDragonX> 4they proved that when they attacked us for no reason whatsoever
<Prince-Dari> <RedDragonX> the second because they wanted to fucking send a statement that we were a disease that doesn't deserve to live
<Prince-Dari> BS, how do you know thart?
<RedDragonX> 4the important factor here is they are over there
<RedDragonX> 4BECAUSE OSAME BIN LADIN SAID IT HIMSELF
<Prince-Dari> America is always doing something.
<RedDragonX> 4TURN ON THE NEWS ONCE IN AWHILE
<RedDragonX> 4Our country got involved with others why?
<RedDragonX> 4because they wanted us to
<Fresh_Blood> 10Osama hasnt been in the news for quite a while
<RedDragonX> 4it started in fucking WW1
<Prince-Dari> I expect that there was a reason for the 9/11. (Obviously I don't mean a justified reason, I mean a reason in the eyes of the terrorists)
<RedDragonX> 4and ever since then people have wanted us to bail them out
<Aduro> 3-.-
<Fresh_Blood> 10I grow tired of this, goodbye
<RedDragonX> 4and that reason was that they believe Americans were evil people
<Aduro> 3....
<Prince-Dari> Nope.
<Prince-Dari> BS.
<RedDragonX> 4oh then genius what is it
<RedDragonX> 4seeing as how their leader SAID that
<RedDragonX> 4please enlighten me
<Prince-Dari> Or you twisted what their leader said.
<RedDragonX> 4the whole freaking world heard it
<RedDragonX> 4he televised it
<RedDragonX> 4and they have it written out
<Prince-Dari> Get me an exact quote.
<Prince-Dari> http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/frontpage/seattle_pima1x220041030.pdf
<Prince-Dari> Exactly what I said
<Prince-Dari> Osama Bin Laden saying that if no one messes with them, they won't attack them.
<RedDragonX> 4"we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all...We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day. We had finished our work that day and had the radio on...Muhammad (Atta) from the Egyptian family (meaning t
<RedDragonX> 4and that claims right there that they are more then willing to die for their religious beliefs
<Prince-Dari> from the Egyptian family (meaning t
<Prince-Dari> Cut off there
<Prince-Dari> Your security is not in the hands of Kerry,
<Prince-Dari> Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own
<Prince-Dari> hands, bin Laden said. Any state that does
<Prince-Dari> not mess with our security has naturally guaranteed
<Prince-Dari> its own security.
<RedDragonX> 4shit
<RedDragonX> 4Al Qaida Egyptian group), was in charge of the group...The brothers, who conducted the operation, all they knew was that they have a martyrdom operation and we asked each of them to go to America but they didn't know anything about the operation, not even one letter. But they were trained and we did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes."[
<RedDragonX> 4I will explain to you the reasons behind these events, and I will tell you the truth about the moments when this decision was taken, so that you can reflect on it. God knows that the plan of striking the towers had not occurred to us, but the idea came to me when things went just too far with the American-Israeli alliance's oppression and atrocities against our people in Palestine and Lebanon.[
<RedDragonX> 4that goes back to yesterday
<Prince-Dari> Your security is not in the hands of Kerry,
<Prince-Dari> Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own
<Prince-Dari> hands, bin Laden said. Any state that does
<Prince-Dari> not mess with our security has naturally guaranteed
<Prince-Dari> its own security.
<Prince-Dari> Oops
<Prince-Dari> Admitting for the first time that he ordered
<Prince-Dari> the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, bin Laden said he
<Prince-Dari> did so because of injustices against the Lebanese
<Prince-Dari> and Palestinians by Israel and the United
<Prince-Dari> States.
<RedDragonX> 4wtf
<SpyroBot> 1,8New Topic Alert:2 "is there any animated characters you have a crush on?" by cynder401, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8722
<Prince-Dari> America interefered.
<RedDragonX> 4which claims what I was saying yesterday to be true
<Prince-Dari> They don't like that, they attack.
<RedDragonX> 4They blamed us for the interference when it was in there hands to begin with
<Prince-Dari> How?
<RedDragonX> 4they didn't accept the deal
<Prince-Dari> What deal?
<RedDragonX> 4they had a chance to make peace
<Prince-Dari> Yes, but they shouldn't have had to accept that deal.
<Aicebo> 13back.
<Prince-Dari> It's all their own land.
<RedDragonX> 4the deal that seperated Isreal into two states...giving Jersusalem to both halfs
<Prince-Dari> It is their land.
<RedDragonX> 4btw Jordon and Palestine were not nations before that
<RedDragonX> 4they were just nomadic territories under British Jurisdiction
<Aicebo> 13Are you freaking kidding me....? STILL?
<Prince-Dari> He organised 9/11 because he didn't like what the US was doing.
<Prince-Dari> As I said.
<Prince-Dari> If they keep out of it, they won't get attacked.
<RedDragonX> 4So he didn't like it because we played a part that was only our part....becasue we gave the Jews a piece of land they refuse to yield as always
<RedDragonX> 4so in turn they attack us because we just happen to be the bad guys
<RedDragonX> 4they could just as much blame you for it
<RedDragonX> 4or the Jews
<RedDragonX> 4or freaking French for all they care
<Aicebo> 13:/
<Prince-Dari> ...
<RedDragonX> 4they go after America because we are the strongest
<RedDragonX> 4they fear us the most
<RedDragonX> 4that's what the point of terrorism is
<Prince-Dari> America interefes most.
<Aicebo> 13ugh
<RedDragonX> 4to install fear in your enemy through hostlie means
<Prince-Dari> America causes them the most problems.
<RedDragonX> 4we interfere because people complain when we don't!
<RedDragonX> 4again back to the beginning of ww!
<Prince-Dari> No they don't.
<RedDragonX> 4WW1
<Prince-Dari> Who has complained?
<RedDragonX> 4and WW2
<RedDragonX> 4And dessert Strom
<Aicebo> 13..............-_____________________-
<RedDragonX> 4well let's see
<RedDragonX> 4WW1
<RedDragonX> 4the French
<RedDragonX> 4the British
<RedDragonX> 4The Russians
<Prince-Dari> They needed your help.
<RedDragonX> 4exactly
<RedDragonX> 4and we gave it to them
<Prince-Dari> America didn't help until it was attacked.
<RedDragonX> 4we "interfered"
<RedDragonX> 4this is WW1
<RedDragonX> 4not WW2
<Prince-Dari> Whatever.
<RedDragonX> 4And guess what
<RedDragonX> 4did you know
<RedDragonX> 4that the British
<Prince-Dari> They asked for help.
<RedDragonX> 4know about the attack on pearl harbor?
<Prince-Dari> The Iraqis didn't ask for help.
<Prince-Dari> Yes.
<Spyrorocks> My mom is a bitch
<RedDragonX> 4and they let it happen
<RedDragonX> 4to get us in the war
<RedDragonX> 4because they would have been overwhelmed if we hadn't
<Prince-Dari> So?
<RedDragonX> 4so you claim we interefere in everything
<Prince-Dari> What has that got to do with anything?
<RedDragonX> 4when most of the time we are either pulled into it or they complain if we dont
<Prince-Dari> You only intefere when people don't want you to.
<RedDragonX> 4you were the one just making a big deal over it
<Prince-Dari> When people to, you don't do anything.
<Prince-Dari> Sit back and watch the fireworks.
<RedDragonX> 4Well Osama also admited that he had ties to Iraq
<RedDragonX> 4so that gave us every reason to go in there
<RedDragonX> 4that and Saddam was fucking nuts
<RedDragonX> 4don't know how people miss that one
<Prince-Dari> BS, most of the terrorists weren't in Iraq.
<RedDragonX> 4his sons were nuts
<Prince-Dari> America placed Saddam there.
<RedDragonX> 4then why did Osama admit his ties to it?
<Prince-Dari> So they could control what was going on there.
<Prince-Dari> I don't know, tactics?
<RedDragonX> 4the low and behold we removed him
<RedDragonX> 4and his nutcase sons
<RedDragonX> 4and we still get blamed for it
<RedDragonX> 4they have a free democracy now
<RedDragonX> 4that's what we gave them
<Terminator> These girls are ace. And their racoon is ace.
<RedDragonX> 4what they do with it now is their own business
<Prince-Dari> America removed him because they didn't like that he wasn't listening to them anymore.
<RedDragonX> 4and that was not reason enough to go in there?
<Prince-Dari> When he was killing people and still listening to America, they did nothing.
<RedDragonX> 4that was a different presidency
<Aicebo> 13Terminator: Give Prince-Dari a hug
<Prince-Dari> It was because it didn't bother them.
<Aicebo> 13Terminator: Give RedDragonX a hug

<Yahoo> An Animator should be able to bring life to any object or character, showing the character’s internal thoughts and feelings through its physical external motion. To do this, the Animator must be a good actor.
<Yahoo> It says moer but that is just the start
<Prince-Dari> Lol
<Prince-Dari> Drama is pointless. :P
<Aicebo> 13I used to take "play" classes for like musicals and stuff...
<Aicebo> 13I was never in a big one because I never wanted to be but we had little performances...

*Yahoo says Muahahaha in 3rd person :P
<Prince-Dari> I locked them up in one of the dungeons, then told them to fight to the death, saying that the person who won would be released.
<Prince-Dari> I burned the one person left standing.
<Prince-Dari> You should have seen his expression.
<Kjakings> 7(Note: I've actually read part of the bible. Hell has two main sections, the flaming bit, and a lesser known whirling blizzard and hailstorm, where the souls of the damned are frozen solid before being hurled violently to work as slaves in the flaming part.)
<Aduro> 3why are you refusing to tell me...please tell me
<Aduro> 3No one can kill me for Long anyway
<spyro_master> 6lol
<Prince-Dari> I shall have to consult the brotherhood on a major choice such as this.
<Kjakings> 7No dari, don't tell him.
<Prince-Dari> You have been denied access to our secrets, and we have decided to forever shun you.

<Prince-Dari> much*
<N3ON> 4Well my younger sister was having a birthday party, and I was avoiding the annoying chick and so my mom's like "I'm not forcing you, but I think you should go talk to her since she's all alone" or soemthing to that effect. So being the amazing and epic person I am (JK of course) I did.
<Aicebo> 13I don't know the girl lol

<N3ON> 4-gasps in shock-
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Prince-Dari> Anyone know the alt code for the backwards question mark?
<N3ON> 4Yes.
<Prince-Dari> You don't, do you?
<N3ON> 4alt + F4
<Prince-Dari> ...
<N3ON> 4:P
<Kjakings> 7alt + 666 (not really, but I'm curious what it'd do))
<Kjakings> 7Ü
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7♪ <--- alt + 13
<Prince-Dari> Found it.
<N3ON> 4It does nothing.
<Kjakings> 7Get Steve on
<Prince-Dari> 
<Prince-Dari> 
<Prince-Dari> 
<Prince-Dari> 
<Kjakings> 7On an american keyboard yes, but on an ENGLISH keyboard for the ENGLISH LANGUAGE then it does Ü, which is rather ironic.
<Prince-Dari> It does block for me
<Kjakings> 7Meh
<Prince-Dari> Oh right, that's just 666, I did 0666
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7Idiot.
<Kjakings> 7try alt + 8658
<Prince-Dari> Most alt codes begin with 0
<Kjakings> 7Ê 8658
<N3ON> 4Jurisdiction!
<Prince-Dari> Because after alt code 0288, they just start repeating themselves again.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Prince-Dari> ~Ok
<Prince-Dari> Sec.
<Kjakings> 7so alt 01 = alt 0289?
<Prince-Dari> No
<Prince-Dari> Yeah.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Kjakings> 7alt 01 does nothing
<Prince-Dari> Oh wait
<Prince-Dari> Alt codes start at alt 032
<Aicebo> 13Alt codes don't work for me...*cries*
<Prince-Dari> Alt codes start at alt 0032
<N3ON> 4Aicebo: Soz.
<Kjakings> 7so alt 032 = alt 0289?
<Rurik> 4kek
<Aicebo> 13N3ON: What?
<Prince-Dari> No, because all except that first alt code repeats.
<Kjakings> 7No, alt 032 = alt 0288. :P
<Prince-Dari> Oh wait.
<N3ON> 4O NOTHING
<Prince-Dari> Yeah.
<Prince-Dari> So.
<Kjakings> 7Doesn't matter now lol
<Prince-Dari> after 0287 they repeat
<Kjakings> 7I PROVED U RONG! I R TEH CHAMPEEUN!
<Prince-Dari> and 0032 = 0288
<Prince-Dari> Well done.
<Rurik> 4AHHHH! NERD TALK IS HURTIGNG EYES! AHHHH! AHHH!

<Spyrorocks> "don't you mean meep meep?" "No, they just paid me to say it once and doubled it up on the track... cheap bastards."
<wyndon_torque> XD
<Kjakings> 7Greatest simpsons episde ebur.
<Spyrorocks> Can't beat the classics.
<Kjakings> 7Nope
<wyndon_torque> lol
<wyndon_torque> Some of the new ones suck.
<Kjakings> 7Unless they're the OLD ones, the "LET'S ALL GO OUT FOR FROSTY CHAWCOLATE MILKSHAKES!" ones.
<wyndon_torque> Actually, most of them do.
<Spyrorocks> I like the old ones
<Spyrorocks> season 2 is really good.
<Kjakings> 7Meh.
<Spyrorocks> They actually have good writing in the old ones
<Spyrorocks> Season 2,3,4,5,6 are the best
<Kjakings> 7I think we only ever got Season 3 over here, Sky probably decided the old ones weren't good enough graphics or something.
<Kjakings> 7Season 3 and up*
<Kjakings> 7I think that's what I ready somewhere anyway.
<Spyrorocks> there is rarely any season 2s on tv
<Spyrorocks> [14:19] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: did you hear i might be coming back.
<wyndon_torque> I noticed that
<Spyrorocks> [14:20] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: Oh, in that case I might move away
<Spyrorocks> [14:20] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: well arent you just the greatest person in the world.
<Spyrorocks> [14:20] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: why are you being mean?
<Kjakings> 7Once, and this actually happened, the Simpsons insulted Fox News pretty badly, and Fox News was planning to sue the Simpsons, until they realised The Simpsons is OWNED by fox.
<Spyrorocks> [14:21] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: because its in my nature to be mean to people
<Spyrorocks> [14:22] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: what do you want?
<Spyrorocks> [14:22] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: just to talk holy, thought it might be nice to talk to you since i havent in a year or two
<Spyrorocks> [14:23] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: Yeah, can't get any better than talking to me.
<Aicebo> 13Haha SR
<Kjakings> 7I could think of some ways
<Kjakings> 7Unless we're talking on something we both agree on lol.
<Spyrorocks> Some fugly annoying chick that I knew in like grade 6 likes to tell me how shes moving back to BC...
<Spyrorocks> [14:24] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: where do you live now?
<Aicebo> 13LOLOL fugly
<Spyrorocks> [14:24] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: still in Hartland New Brunswick
<Spyrorocks> [14:25] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: wow that shit hole, no wonder why you're moving back.
<Spyrorocks> Hahaha I just made myself laugh
<Spyrorocks> remembering what I said to this chick in grade 6
<Spyrorocks> [14:25] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: "might" be moving back, and its not a shit hole, its just, very...very...Oh fuck okay whatever its a shit hole
<Kjakings> 7What did you say in grade 6? Because I know you're itching to tell us :P
<Spyrorocks> One day I told her she should be a lesbian because no guys would ever date her, then she told me she had a crush on me until I said that and that she hates me now. That was in grade 6.
<Terminator> super
<Kjakings> 7That was an epic win.
<Spyrorocks> So I pretty much killed 2 birds with one stone so to speak.
<Kjakings> 7Hold on, you should put the Ignitus232 tricks you played on your wall of shame and a wall of fame you get. Wall of shame for Ignitus232, fame for the trick itself.
<Spyrorocks> I (a) insulted her, and (b) made sure she would never like me again
<Aicebo> 13wow
<Aicebo> 13haha that's mean
<Spyrorocks> but (b) is sort of failing because im irresistible even though im a jerk.
<Aicebo> 13XDDDD
<Aicebo> 13brb/bbl
<Spyrorocks> [14:29] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: which reminds me, are you gay?
<Spyrorocks> [14:30] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: Yes, I love men
<Spyrorocks> [14:31] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: are you being sarcastic with me?
<Spyrorocks> [14:31] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: I'm waiting for you to come back so I can date you.
<Spyrorocks> [14:32] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: HEY! no need to get personal! didnt mean to piss yeah off! gosh, you sure can be mean
<Terminator> You're watching the Family Learning Channel. And now, angry tics fly out of my nipples!
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: What trick?
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo, you still got those pastebins with the Ignitus232 tricks?
<Prince-Dari> <Aicebo> brb/bbl
<Spyrorocks> [14:34] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: I know, im such a jerk
<Spyrorocks> [14:36] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: there are three ways i can answer that, one is to Agree with you, but then you might come back with a mean joke or get mad. Two i could not answer and then you would get mad or just not say anything else, OR three disagree and then say something or get mad, like #1. whcih one should i choose,
<Spyrorocks> [14:37] •·.·´¯`·.·• Spyrorocks •·.·´¯`·.·•: all of the above
<Prince-Dari> LOL

<Aicebo> 13:P
<Prince-Dari> Heheheh
<fresh_blood> 10I figured it was that and no, I dont
<Prince-Dari> It doesn't really work with punctuation at the moment though
<Prince-Dari> fresh_blood: Put the first two letters at the end, and add ay to the end
<fresh_blood> 10I know, It just takes me a while to work it out
<Prince-Dari> Hmm
<Prince-Dari> Let me see if this works.
<Prince-Dari> Someone speak.

<fresh_blood> Anthropormorphicpersonification
<Prince-Dari> w00t.
<Terminator> Hello, I live in a hat made of cheese
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Prince-Dari> Win
<fresh_blood> Spyro is made out of either sponge or marshmellow, just try to argue with me
<Prince-Dari> Now what happens if I turn both spam scripts on?
*Prince-Dari turns the other one on
<Prince-Dari> /set %rev 1
<Prince-Dari> Someone speak, lawl
<fresh_blood> Agado do do push pineapple shake a tree
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Prince-Dari> Now to make a 12 year old AOLer spam script.
<Terminator> good.. bad.. I'm the bot with the gun^@@%!%~#$$@$
<Terminator> ^!%@^***$@$#*
<fresh_blood> ...
<fresh_blood> ok then
<fresh_blood> That's pretty annoying
<Prince-Dari> Yup
<fresh_blood> I was serious about Spyro being made out of either sponge or marshmellow by the way
<Prince-Dari> Well it explains why water kills him
<Prince-Dari> But his own fire would burn him if he was,
<fresh_blood> Nah, fire retardant sponge
<fresh_blood> It also explains why he can charge into walls without a scratch
<fresh_blood> He's a sponge I tell you, a sponge!!!
<RedDragonX> oh great you going off about the marshmellow theory already lol
<Prince-Dari> Hm
<RedDragonX> or sponge theory
<fresh_blood> Oh yes
<fresh_blood> sponge/marshmellow theory
<RedDragonX> as crazy as it sounds it does make sense lol
<Prince-Dari> I have a cake/caek theory...
<fresh_blood> It cant compare to my sponge.marshmello theory, mine is airtight
<Prince-Dari> It isn't about Spyro. :P
<fresh_blood> Then whats it about?
<Prince-Dari> Cake/Caek
<fresh_blood> I dont understand
<Prince-Dari> Let me find it.
<Prince-Dari> <prince-dari> Should you take an atom of cake, and use nuclear fision on it, to find out exactly what it contains, you find nothing more than trapped light, although what traps the light is an extremely thin layer of a substance called xenophen, this is what keeps the light in the 'atoms', and gives them structure, otherwise the light would simply escape, therefore cake has no taste, or smell. As this element is odorless and tasteless.
<fresh_blood> ...cake isnt an atom
<Prince-Dari> I know.
<Aicebo> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Prince-Dari> I made it an atom.
<Prince-Dari> Lawl.
<fresh_blood> therefore it makes no sense
<fresh_blood> lol
<Prince-Dari> I know you can't make atoms.
<Prince-Dari> It's not meant to.
<Aicebo> I can't stop eee-ing
<Prince-Dari> That's why it's MY theory.
<Prince-Dari> Because it makes no sense what so ever.
<fresh_blood> Shameful, at least MY theory makes sense lol
<Prince-Dari> Mine isn't meant to.
<Prince-Dari> Therefore it is made of win,.
<fresh_blood> Light doesnt exist in atoms...
<Prince-Dari> Did you miss where I said it's not supposed to make sense?
<RedDragonX> hm
<fresh_blood> ...I cant grasp things that make no sense...
<Prince-Dari> No one should be able to grasp it.
<Prince-Dari> The point is that no one understand it.
<Terminator> mmmmm breasts
<Prince-Dari> O_o
<fresh_blood> a single atom of cake cant undergo fission
<Prince-Dari> Well as mentioned earlier, you can't have an atom of cake.
<fresh_blood> ...I'll stop now
<RedDragonX> what the heck were you debating about? lol
<fresh_blood> ...I...have...no idea
<RedDragonX> oh.....well that's one of Dari's threories then lol
<Aicebo> omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
<fresh_blood> I sense that things are a little slow tonight
<Aicebo> NU UUUUUUH!
<RedDragonX> goes back and forth lol
<Prince-Dari> Someone speak.
<Prince-Dari> MWAHAAHAHAHA
<PARANOiA> Hi
<Terminator> i'm in a bear suit
<Prince-Dari> Meh.

<Prince-Dari> Hmm
<RedDragonX> well just don't say stupid stuff and you wont get booted lol
<RedDragonX> 0.o
<RedDragonX> that was wier
<RedDragonX> "wierd"
<Prince-Dari> My 12 year old AOLer spamming machine is taking shape
<PARANOiA> Dari and his little scripts

<Terminator> The taste of human annihilation grows stronger in my amazing head.

<Prince-Dari> Hmm
<Prince-Dari> the to teh.
<Prince-Dari> Good idea
<Prince-Dari> What else...
<Prince-Dari> How can I make it remove all punctuation...
<PARANOiA> Add at least 5 exclamation marks after each sentence
<Prince-Dari> Ok
<PARANOiA> Yeah, that's really annoying
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Aduro> what is the point in that?
<Prince-Dari> Hmm

<PARANOiA> Not really
<PARANOiA> It's not, don't worry
<PARANOiA> :P
<Prince-Dari> Ok. :P
<Aduro> but, then again, I'm easily annoyed
<Aicebo> hm
<Aicebo> I'll bbl
<fresh_blood> SPYRO IS A MARSHMELLOW!!!
<RedDragonX> wth
<RedDragonX> hmmm
<Aduro> what is with everyone....
<RedDragonX> what?
<RedDragonX> there is nothing wrong with everyone here lol
<Aduro> ......
<Aduro> Fresh_blood's comment...
<PARANOiA> Only you, being so easily annoyed
<fresh_blood> Really? I think we all get slightly less sane each time we come on here
<RedDragonX> what's wrong with what FB said lol
<fresh_blood> I SPEAK NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
<Aduro> You're talking to the wrong person about sanity...
<fresh_blood> He's a marshmellow I tell you
<Aduro> How did you come to that conclusion
<fresh_blood> AHA someone's actually got me to explain why. Give me a sec to collaborate my thoughts
<RedDragonX> I have actually taken to eathing miniature marshmellows
<Prince-Dari> Hmm
<fresh_blood> You see, he doesnt get hurt when falling off buildings and charging into walls. Therefore he is made out of marshmellow because that would absorb the impact of the fall or charge. Sparx is there to stop him from being punctured by sharp objects and when a marshmellow gets wet it gets a slimy coating, giving Spyro the appearence of wet scales
<Prince-Dari> Have to hve
<fresh_blood> You're eating Spyro's babies!!!
<Aduro> oh lord....
<PARANOiA> AHHH
<PARANOiA> XD
<fresh_blood> Try to proove me wrong, I dares ya
<fresh_blood> When he gets squashed he pops back into shape, just like what? A marshmellow
<Aduro> ......thats only in the Original Series
<fresh_blood> Keep going with your point
<Aduro> In the Legend of Spyro series, he isn't a marshmellow
<fresh_blood> And why not?
<Prince-Dari> Hm

<Stormy> Hi there Cactus :)
<Prince-Dari> Yeah...
<Catabatus> Hi
<Prince-Dari> I have 3 different settings
<Prince-Dari> One that reverses everything you say.
<Prince-Dari> One that changes it to pig latin
<RedDragonX> holy lag
<Stormy> I thought your scripts weren't allowed in here?
<Prince-Dari> And one that changes it into 12 year old AOLer language.
<Prince-Dari> It isn't a script.
<Catabatus> >.>
<Prince-Dari> It's a button on a menu.
<Prince-Dari> o_o
<Stormy> Pff, like I know the difference =P
<Stormy> Script... bot... whatever it is
<Prince-Dari> And technically, SR said I wasn't allowed bots...
<Prince-Dari> He never said I couldn't have the odd user script. O_O
<Stormy> I don't care
<Prince-Dari> Lawl. :P
<Stormy> He never told me the rule, so I couldn't do anything even if I wanted to
<Stormy> Lol @ Fresh_blood
<Fresh_blood> It's true, you cant deny it
<Stormy> You know you're just going to get a bunch of little kids whining at you for insulting Cynder
<Fresh_blood> I havent insulted her, everyone likes marshmallows
<Prince-Dari> I don't.
<Fresh_blood> besides the kids should be happy, she's more huggable now
<Stormy> "NUUUUU CYNDAR ISH TEH SEHXEH!!!!!111 SHES NAWT A FREAKIN MARSHMALLOWW!!11"

<Stormy> I gave prince-dari an idea
<Stormy> That can't be good

<Terminator> Prince-dari... analysis: annoying!
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> Verrrry perceptive.
<Stormy> Terminator: Loooooooooooooooooooool
<Prince-Dari> Even the bots have me sussed out.
<Prince-Dari> Wow.
<Stormy> If I had one of those things that stored funny quotes, that would be in it.
<Stormy> :D
<Fresh_blood> Of course now I need to think up strong defenses for my theory for one someone tries to dispute it
<Prince-Dari> Yeah, I'll put it in. :P
<Catabatus> They're talkibg about Twilight on TV! HIDE THE KIDS!!!
<Catabatus> *talking

<Catabatus> WUDDYU MEEN WHO EES EDWARD?! ONLEE THE HAWTEST SPARKING VAMPITE IN DA WURLD

<Fresh_blood> easily lo;
<Stormy> NO MINE D:
<Stormy> MY EDWARD
<Fresh_blood> and you're ruining my argument, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON MY SIDE!!!
*Catabatus hisses and spits in Stormy's face.
<RedDragonX> I was just offering my opinion lol
*Stormy throws apples at Catabatus
*Catabatus unsheathes her claws.
*Catabatus rips Stormy's limbs off her body
*Stormy throws marshmallows at Catabatus
<RedDragonX> personally I don't care lol...and yes I support the theory in general if I was to go with a theory lol....because it makes sense
*Catabatus destorys Stormy's face
<Stormy> D:
<Catabatus> *destroys
<Stormy> EDWARD WILL NEVAR LUFF MEH NAO!!111 :(
<Catabatus> I fail tonight.
<RedDragonX> I was just pointing out that I'm pretty sure the developers made it that way because they didn't want him to take damage from falls lol......anything we assume is just our imaginations filling in gaps
<Stormy> hahah, OK, enough of this :P
<Catabatus> Heh
<Fresh_blood> ...we all know that the developers did it...but where's the fun in that?
<Prince-Dari> Actually, I control the developers, so I did it.
<Catabatus> The fun is a lie.
<Stormy> ...
<Stormy> :(
<RedDragonX> it's realism lol
<Fresh_blood> Cyner and Spyro are now and ever shall be Marshmallows until someone absolutely destroys my Theory.
<RedDragonX> sorry I'm a realist :P
<Stormy> http://edward-cullen.net/ Lol
<Catabatus> ....
<Catabatus> they....
<Stormy> Read the comments; they sound exactly how Catabatus and I did earlier :P
<Catabatus> They did NOT...
<Catabatus> "LUVREDWARDS: I LUV EDWARDD LUV HM"
<Catabatus> "I love Edward: Edward is soooo hot!"
<Stormy> hahahahaha
<Catabatus> "Giselle: he is THE hottest vamp ALIVE!!! he is SEXY!!!!!!!"
<Stormy> He's alive?
<Prince-Dari> Do all the names have love, and Edward in?
<Stormy> I didn't know that
<Stormy> =/
<Catabatus> "kaitlynn: I love this sexy vampire till i die!!! "
<Prince-Dari> Vampires are undead.
<Prince-Dari> What an idiot.
<Stormy> Oh wow
<A_Guy> Marshmallow Spyro and Cynder FTW!
<Catabatus> "kaitlynn: so sexyy <3"
<Stormy> That's just sad
<Stormy> Oh hey, A_Guy
<Catabatus> "Bridget ♥: OMG HE IZ SOOO HOT :D LOL i love him as much as a fat kid loves cake hahahaha ☺"
<Prince-Dari> lol
<Fresh_blood> Ha ha I have followers
<Prince-Dari> lol
<Fresh_blood> I shall spread my theory till its known everywhere
<Catabatus> "Bridget ♥: SEXY VAMPIRE ON THE LOOSE!!! HAHAHA"
<Stormy> I cannot stop laughing
<Catabatus> "dina+sarah xD: you're so hot we can't believe that one person like you (hot) exist xDD"
<Prince-Dari> Let me test...
<Stormy> I should come here more often
<Prince-Dari> Lol
<Prince-Dari> Hm
<Catabatus> "dina+sarah xD: we wanna have your emailadress or your telefonnummber but we don't know how we can get their"
<Stormy> O_o
<Prince-Dari> Does it remove all my punctuation, lol?
<Catabatus> "dina+sarah xD: we shoutet the whole movie because of you you are so sweet :-*"
<Prince-Dari> No, apparently not
<RedDragonX> hm
<Prince-Dari> This is weird, lol.
<Prince-Dari> One sec
<Catabatus> "peace.love.edward: i love you edward:$"
<Fresh_blood> I need more crackpot theories...hmmm....I'll get started on them right away
<Stormy> Prince-Dari: Make it type like one of those 12-year-old anime fangirls
<Stormy> OMIGOSH KAWAIIII!!!11
<Prince-Dari> Example?
<Prince-Dari> Eurgh, no, I don't think I could handle that.
<Stormy> Haha
<Fresh_blood> What hasn't been explained in the Spyro universe?
<Stormy> Why Cynder has such an annoying fanbase
<Prince-Dari> Lol
<Catabatus> Who knows...
<RedDragonX> because most are freaking little kids who don't know better
<Prince-Dari> Lol turns to "lululul", lol.
<Stormy> ...
<Prince-Dari> Uhh
*Catabatus draws a picture of Edward Cullen "anime style" and burns it
<Stormy> Guess that's explained then
<RedDragonX> at least that's what I think lol
<Stormy> OK, I got one
<Prince-Dari> Because I say so, and I own you all
<Stormy> Why does Malefor want to blow up the world, and why does Spyro doing a fury put it back together?
<Catabatus> I STILL have to work on that comic...
<A_Guy> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lol+theory
<Fresh_blood> I'll get started on it straight away, I will come up with an explanation!!!
<Prince-Dari> Because by blowing up the world, you make a new world
<Stormy> (yeah, I watched some of the cutscenes from DotD because I can't be bothered to waste my money one the game)
<Prince-Dari> However that works
<RedDragonX> in the game didn't he say that the true role of the purple dragon was to bring about the great cleasing of the world?
<Catabatus> ...The one where I show how messed up the ending to DotD is
*Spyrorocks doesn't own DotD yet.
<Prince-Dari> Hey SR
<Spyrorocks> Hey
<Stormy> You're making a comic of that?
<Stormy> Awesome
<Fresh_blood> Spyrorocks must approve my Marshmallow theory, then it'll be undisputable
<RedDragonX> psstt....this would be one of those times where Zero would freaking be usefull
<Prince-Dari> Zero?
<Spyrorocks> zero
<Spyrorocks> ?
<RedDragonX> Zerodius
<Catabatus> Uh huh
<Fresh_blood> I know of Zero, but I dont know her
<Stormy> Her?
<Prince-Dari> ...What?
<RedDragonX> a freaking fanfiction writer who is absolutely nuts with coming up with theories on these games
<Stormy> Zerodius is a girl?
<RedDragonX> and she it's a she
<Catabatus> I think I'll have to draw it on paper and then remake it on Photoshop...
<Stormy> Wow
<Stormy> I never knew that
<RedDragonX> I think it's all she does with her life
<RedDragonX> gah....she even drives me nuts
<Fresh_blood> I think me and Zero could come up with some very interesting theories to the inconsistances in the Spyro univers
<Stormy> Haha, you should meet Serge165
<Prince-Dari> Hmm, also I think I'll change really to ORLY
<Terminator> when will the lies end?!
<Spyrorocks> Oh no...
<RedDragonX> I'm sure you guys could
<Spyrorocks> not serge...
<Stormy> If you think Zerodius is bad....
<Spyrorocks> Zerodius is a chick?
<Stormy> Nothing compared to Serge
<RedDragonX> You have not been through the vast majority of Zero's stuff lol
<RedDragonX> one time I at there for 5 freaking hours...while she ranted on about how all these games were linked
<Fresh_blood> I hope she approves to my marshmallow theory
<Stormy> He would go on and on about his Spyro theories to me for hours
<RedDragonX> She wont post on it
*Catabatus hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "gal" and "babe"
<Stormy> On MSN
<Stormy> D:
<Fresh_blood> why not?
<RedDragonX> She get's me on gmail -.-
<Spyrorocks> Serge makes up songs about spyro characters and will type them to you over msn.
<RedDragonX> because she doesn't post on the forum much anymore
<Prince-Dari> LOL
<Catabatus> ...
<RedDragonX> and she is under a different name now
<Fresh_blood> shame
<Stormy> And he keeps sending me "<3" and meowing at me
<Stormy> Hahaha
<Prince-Dari> ...
*Catabatus twitches
<RedDragonX> she is afraid that her ideas will be rediculed too much lol
<Prince-Dari> WTH?
<Fresh_blood> I just need a few followers to spread the word of the marshmallow
<Stormy> I disabled Messenger
<Stormy> Because it kept signing me in randomly and he would contact me
<Prince-Dari> Lol
<Prince-Dari> Wow, this is REALLY annoying
<RedDragonX> I'm just glad John isn't screwed up with her anymore
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Stormy> Orly annoying?
<Stormy> lol'
<Prince-Dari> Yes.
<Prince-Dari> ARGH!
<Prince-Dari> Oh come on
<Stormy> =/
<Stormy> OK, this is starting to get old
<Prince-Dari> Wow
<Fresh_blood> JOHN!!! He'll join my marshmallow army, especially if I explain it to him in a certain way
<Stormy> Turn it off now plz
<Prince-Dari> Fine, :P
<Terminator> blimey
<RedDragonX> John wont post on the forum lol
<Fresh_blood> I'll make him
<Stormy> See, you're scaring Terminator
<RedDragonX> he doesn't have time to man lol
<Fresh_blood> I'll make him find time
<RedDragonX> heck I don't even see him much now
<Spyrorocks> On 24 they have Mac computers that run Vista.
<Fresh_blood> me nietehr but I'll find him eventually
<RedDragonX> the most we talked for this whole week was five minutes
<Fresh_blood> usually on msn
<RedDragonX> well...I don't have MSN
<Rurik> kek
<RedDragonX> he is prolly on there more
<Stormy> Ohai Rurik
<Rurik> Hai
<Fresh_blood> He roleplays on MSN from time to time
<Prince-Dari> ...
<Prince-Dari> O_o
<Stormy> Eew roleplaying
<RedDragonX> he is still doing the roleplaying?
<Stormy> I hate roleplaying
<Fresh_blood> with someone else
<RedDragonX> jeez I thought he was done with that
<Fresh_blood> At least I think he does
<RedDragonX> who?
<Fresh_blood> he never did change his name back
<RedDragonX> well his name hasn't changed on gmail either
<Stormy> That was another annoying thing about MSN, this other guy always asked me to RP
<Fresh_blood> I dont know who, he never said
<RedDragonX> still that.........yeaaaah
<Fresh_blood> No, his gamail is the same, but on MSN it changed
<RedDragonX> not like he needs it now due to the recent events
<Spyrorocks> I'm going to a friend's 16th birthday party on saturday, what should I get her?
<Fresh_blood> true lol
<RedDragonX> depends on the girl
<Fresh_blood> Im going to an 18th what do I get him?!!!!
<Prince-Dari> I dunno, a stripper?
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Terminator> Prince-Dari you're looking especially shagworthy today
<Fresh_blood> I'm terrible at buying gifts for people
<Stormy> :P
<Stormy> Hahaha what?
<Spyrorocks> Fresh_blood: Me too
<RedDragonX> I could tell you if I knew what kind of person they are lol
<Fresh_blood> lol then whats a safe gift?
<Prince-Dari> A gift card?
<Prince-Dari> Money?
<RedDragonX> 18th for a guy or girl?
<Fresh_blood> guy
<Stormy> Yeah, go with a gift card
<Spyrorocks> Money is no fun, gift cards suck
<Stormy> Or cash
<RedDragonX> well gift cards do always work lol
<Terminator> Cards = fuck-coin.
<Stormy> Everyone loves cash
<RedDragonX> do you have any idea what he likes?
<Stormy> =/
<Stormy> =/
<Stormy> =/
<Spyrorocks> I don't know
<Spyrorocks> I haven't seen her for 3 years
<Fresh_blood> well we havent been able to talk for months so no, not anymore, I think money is my safest bet
<RedDragonX> hm
<Prince-Dari> SR has so much money, that getting it for his birthday doesn't interest him, LOL
<RedDragonX> well it certainly doesn't help if it's for people you have not seen or talked to in months/years lol
<RedDragonX> you guys are screwed lol
<Fresh_blood> lol true
<RedDragonX> so just go with money
<Spyrorocks> I probably am
<RedDragonX> and a nice card
<Stormy> Haha, I never have this problem
<Spyrorocks> or just get her something id like.
<RedDragonX> lol
<Stormy> No one likes me IRL =P
<Spyrorocks> Thats what I usually do.
<Catabatus> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-259949.html#259949
<Fresh_blood> I'll give him mney....and a particularly 18th related birthday card
<RedDragonX> why wouldn't anybody like you in real life :P
<Stormy> Catabatus: XD
<Spyrorocks> <insert smart ass comment here>
<Stormy> Thanks a lot =/
<Spyrorocks> I usually just buy people stuff that I like
<RedDragonX> hm
<Spyrorocks> because I like cool things.
<RedDragonX> well you can always go with something involving technology lol....if you feel like spending money
<Fresh_blood> Has it been explained why there is only one purple dragon every 10 generations?
<RedDragonX> gah................no
<Fresh_blood> Right then, I'll explain that to
<Fresh_blood> o
<RedDragonX> does it matter? lol
<Stormy> ..........
<Stormy> >_>
<Fresh_blood> No, but its another excuse for an insane theory
<Catabatus> Nothing matters/
*Catabatus backs away into a corner
<Catabatus> Nothiiiiiiing
<RedDragonX> just don't be like Aduro and go ranting on about fanfictions
<Fresh_blood> I wont lol
<Fresh_blood> more marshmallow related explanations on the horizon!!!
<RedDragonX> then go make a topic on it or something lol
<Prince-Dari> The best kind of explanations.
<Fresh_blood> I will, once I have a theory
<RedDragonX> well good luck with that one
<Fresh_blood> Im thinking colour preservatives need to be mixed in the right order, thats why a purple dragon wouldnt make a purple dragon egg
<Catabatus> ...
<Fresh_blood> it has to be the right combonations of red,blues, blacks etc etc etc
<Catabatus> .....
<Rurik> ...huh?
<Fresh_blood> hmm, maybe not
<RedDragonX> just so you know lol......they don't really want to hear the theories on here :P
<Prince-Dari> I reckon that Spyro lives in Narnia, and that the 10 generations is the time between each game, as time passes differently there than here.
<Fresh_blood> I'll refreain from posting them until I have undeniable evidence then
<Stormy> Huh, Aicebo messaged me on Facebook 10 hours ago....
<RedDragonX> I forgot she just created one
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Rurik> Spyro is a purple dragon. Purple dragons form regardless of parents, as it is only once every ten genreations.
<Fresh_blood> I have one...terrible terrible pictures on it, I hate it when people post pictures of me!!
<Stormy> I would have been at school then
<Rurik> At least, that's what I think. Holy crap, I though tof something
<RedDragonX> I have one lol...that I never really go on
<Fresh_blood> But there must be a reason!
<Stormy> And facebook is blocked at school
<Stormy> Yeah, I don't use it either
<RedDragonX> no real need to
<Stormy> It's kind of useless
<Spyrorocks> I have facebook
<Stormy> I see my IRL friends every day at school anyway
<Spyrorocks> But they wouldnt let me use my real name
<RedDragonX> you have a faceboo? lol
<Prince-Dari> !AOL lol just testing to see if everything is working as it should, although I expect it is, I'm working on making it even more accurate, heheheh. That's good though, right?
<Steve> !AOL LULULUL JUST TESTNG TO SEE IF EVERYTHNG ISH WORKNG AS IT SHOULD, ALTHOUGH I EXPECT IT IS, IM WORKNG ON MAKNG IT EVEN MORE ACCURATE, HEHEHEH.!!!!!!! THTS GOOD THOUGH, RIGHT?
<RedDragonX> all but 5 people on my friend list are really my friends lol
*Stormy wonders if she should ignore all of SR's comments after the last one
<Fresh_blood> most of mine are family...
*Spyrorocks thinks she should
<Catabatus> I'm posting this on Aicebo's profile: http://www.girl.com.au/img/teletubbies10_birthday.jpg
<RedDragonX> well I know them from school...but I have a big difference between a friend and an aquaintance in my mind
<Stormy> I have 30 "friends"
<Fresh_blood> I prefer to make aquaintances, no loyalty then lol or responsibilities
<RedDragonX> I have maybe 5 true friends
<Stormy> But they just add me so they can seem like they're cool and have more friends
<Stormy> Hah
<Stormy> You're lucky
<Fresh_blood> About the same here, maybe 3
<Stormy> I /thought/ I had one. Maybe two
<Rurik> 3 here as well
<RedDragonX> Well....two of them are online lol
<Stormy> D:
<RedDragonX> and three in real life
<RedDragonX> just people who I know will always help me no matter what
<Spyrorocks> I'm kool i has lots of msn contacts
<Fresh_blood> well if I include internet it goes up to 6
<Stormy> SR: Fine
<Catabatus> Yowza
<RedDragonX> Stormy I think I found your facebook once lol
<Rurik> mine climbs to 7...
<Stormy> Yeah, I know you did =P
<Stormy> You're on my friends list now
<RedDragonX> Yay
<RedDragonX> I have 192 friends :/
<Prince-Dari> I don't use any social networking sites.
<Prince-Dari> Lol.
<Fresh_blood> I stay away from facebook, I dont like the pictures people put of me on it
*Catabatus pushes her spectacles down her nose and peers at RedDrahonX
<RedDragonX> why are you peering at me? lol
<Prince-Dari> Meh, I'n bored.
*Catabatus peers some more
<RedDragonX> 0.o
<Prince-Dari> I'm*
<RedDragonX> I think I'll check my facebook now lol...
*Fresh_blood blindfolds Catabatus
<Fresh_blood> no peering
<Catabatus> What?
*Catabatus whips around and accidentally knocks Fresh_Blood over
<Catabatus> Oh, sorry.
<Fresh_blood> Quite alright
*Fresh_blood leads Catabatus into a door
<RedDragonX> hm...
<Fresh_blood> sorry bout that
<RedDragonX> I should change my profile pic
*Catabatus stands in the dorrway
<Stormy> I've had the same one since I joined
<Stormy> I've only uploaded that one picture
*Fresh_blood shuts and looks door

<Yahoo> Joey started stirring again, a little loose flower spraying out onto his black t-shirt. “Aw fuck!” he said, and without a second thought pulled it off over his head and threw it onto the counter behind him. Wednesday slapped his forehead and groaned. Just what they needed, Joey stripping to add to the mess already going on.
<Yahoo> “So? You can’t eat all that and cookies, you’ll explode. You’re too tiny.” “I’M NOT TINY!” Joey said as he jumped up and down, throwing a fit like a five-year-old. Ben just laughed and shook his head, returning to the cookie dough.

<Kjakings> Sounds like a relly shitty animé
<Ne-Own> Haha it's no anime.
<Aicebo> It's not anime it's an old american cartoon =P
<Aicebo> I'll find a vid
<Ne-Own> Quite old.
<Ne-Own> Find one where they summon him.
<Kjakings> Doesn't have to be made in japan to be an animé anymore. That super robot monkey team hyper force go (super monkey kettle force) was American made.
<Ne-Own> But it's not an anime, that's all you need to know.
<Kjakings> Sounds animé
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpXM9bj-WPU lololol
<Ne-Own> So does your face.
<Aicebo> It's not, it's an old cartoon like Hee-man
<Aicebo> drawn like it anyways
<Ne-Own> *He-Man.
<Aicebo> I guess
<Aicebo> OH WHATEVER :P
<Ne-Own> :P
<Ne-Own> They made fun of this show on Rugrats.
<Kjakings> It's SO power-rangers combined with animé. Anyone with an impartial view will tell you that.
<Ne-Own> There's no anime whatsoever.
<Aicebo> Nah.
<Ne-Own> XD
<Aicebo> Not anime
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO41GWNePDI
<Kjakings> Right ok, you two go be general americans and ignore everything people say. No-one expects anything different really.
<Ne-Own> It sounds liek your theory is based on: "zomg therz an asian in eht therfur its anime!!!!11"
<Aicebo> I hated the Heart dude and his fuckin monkey though
<Ne-Own> How is heart even close to an element?
<Ne-Own> :P
<Aicebo> Idk
<Terminator> if i tell you, i will have to kill you
<Aicebo> LOOOOOOVE
<Aicebo> :P
<Aicebo> who knows

<Aicebo> Kjakings: Don't tell me how to do my job. She has her warning.
<Hail> But, what did I do...? :(
<Aicebo> Hail: Hush and move on
<Aduro> whatever
<Hail> Huh.
<Hail> Oh, yeah and hi yahoo.

<Yahoo> Thanks Kieran
<Aicebo> Hi
<Stormy> hi
<Yahoo> No let us all be silent, an admin has come
<Kjakings> And that's gotta be worth something coming from ME lol Yahoo.
<Aduro> I have or had a friend in real life named Stormy
<Kjakings> Stormy, do you agree that Yahoo's work => Razz's?
<Yahoo> What? A storm drain?
<Stormy> Kjakings: I hate Razz, so yes
<Stormy> Yahoo: D:
<Kjakings> Ok, now an impartial opinion from Stormy :P
<Yahoo> It was a flash thing my teacher made
<Yahoo> "Stormy the Storm Drain"
<Kjakings> Lol
<Stormy> I haven't seen much of Yahoo's work
<Kjakings> Yes well it's better. :P
<Stormy> But anyone wins by default over Razz
<Stormy> :P
<Yahoo> It was about stopping people clogging them up XD
<Aicebo> Does that mean that my shitty art is better than Razz'? :D
<Yahoo> OW
<Stormy> Aicebo: Of course
<Yahoo> Earing
<Yahoo> ow
<Stormy> :L
<Aicebo> YAY
<Yahoo> That hurt like heck
<Kjakings> Oh yeah Yahoo, I can breed you a silver for the animation I haven't decided what I want it to be about now if you want.
<Aduro> least its alive in here...
<Aicebo> http://aicebo.deviantart.com/art/Annoyed-at-the-Store-112254152
<Yahoo> I got my earring caught in my hair
<Stormy> Haha, cute
<Yahoo> HA!
<Kjakings> Oh yeah Yahoo, I can breed you a silver for the animation I haven't decided what I want it to be about now if you want.
<Stormy> Hey, a poll from SFRB
<Aicebo> http://aicebo.deviantart.com/art/Not-REALLY-Love-TLoS-Fans-112614245 my newest making fun of the TLoS designs
<Yahoo> THats original, lol wing straightener
<Stormy> "Eyebrows are God's greatest creation"
<Stormy> XD
<Kjakings> 22:04	Kjakings	Oh yeah Yahoo, I can breed you a silver for the animation I haven't decided what I want it to be about now if you want. Answeeeeerrrrrrr......
<Yahoo> Not now please
<Yahoo> I'm waaaaaaaaay too tired to think...
<Yahoo> That's why my Cassire came out really really crappy
<Yahoo> And the fact she has to have some surgery :D
<Kjakings> It takes like three seconds for me to gift it to you.
<Stormy> Kjakings: Who were you talking about on the spam forum if it wasn't me?
<Stormy> SR?
<Yahoo> The bottom of her head stuck out like a bloody flag
<Stormy> DDR?
<Kjakings> Stormy: Does it matter?
<Stormy> Kjakings: Yes
<Aduro> oh by the way, Aicebo, those drawings are nice....
<Kjakings> Well tough lol. Not telling. Besides, I didn't akshully mean that bit, I'm just too lazy to go and edit.
<Stormy> Yeah, whatever :P
<Kjakings> 22:06	Kjakings	It takes like three seconds for me to gift it to you. Yahoo >.<
<Yahoo> 22:03 Stormy I haven't seen much of Yahoo's work And I have heard the others call me the "Mini Razz" because I post most of my art here .............I do take that as a damn well insult.
<Kjakings> I called you Razz in training thank you.
<Stormy> D:
<Kjakings> :P
<Stormy> Poor Yahoo
<Kjakings> Get your facts right during an accusation.
<Stormy> How could you call her such a horrible name? :P
<Stormy> Yahoo: Do you have an art thread?
<Kjakings> Yahoo, DO YOU WANT THE STUPID SILVER?! I'll breed it, then explain how to gift it step by step, K?
<Yahoo> "Ets RUDE to swear and call people namezzzz" XD
<Yahoo> Oh
<Yahoo> Erm, I I cant do a trade to night
<Kjakings> Why? It's easy and takes about three seconds on a live chat.
<Yahoo> My finger cant hold down f5 that much XD
<Kjakings> >.<
<Stormy> For what it's worth (probably not much) those trades never work for me
<Stormy> I've had my /brother/ try to send me one; we could talk IRL and it didn't work
<Aicebo> "HE'S IN LUFF WITH KIM KIM'S IN LUFF WITH HIM"
<Stormy> D:
<Yahoo> "Ets RUDE to swear and call people namezzzz" XD I love Kidsplay
<Kjakings> Always worked for me. I gifted a stone to a friend in response for soem art (the picture itself came out looking like a girl, but oh well), and it worked fine. If it doesn't work, I think I can breed you another.
<Yahoo> Tomorrow please kieran
<Kjakings> Fiiiiiiiiine.
<Stormy> Hahaha
<Stormy> Why was Hail banned this time?
<Aicebo> She was being obnoxious and annoying as hell to everyone.
<Aicebo> Hey SR
<Kjakings> Hey SR
<Stormy> Hey
<Terminator> o snap
<Spyrorocks> hey
<Stormy> Oh, of course
<Spyrorocks> sup
<Kjakings> Shut up Terminator
<Stormy> Typical Hail
<Terminator> nnk
<Aicebo> *dances*
<Kjakings> Of anyone, Hail's the miniature Raxx
<Kjakings> Razz*
<Kjakings> Lol
<Yahoo> RAXX LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Kjakings> Not that funny
<Yahoo> If I fall off the chair, it is classed as funny
<Aicebo> Hail obsesses over art && obsesses over artists so Kja is correct.
<Kjakings> Hail is also an obnoxious self-centered cow.
<Yahoo> She's 9
<Yahoo> Thats why
<Kjakings> She's fiive methinks
<Stormy> Spyrorocks: I'm sure you figured it out already, but if you didn't, I didn't respond to your message last night because my internet died.
<Yahoo> Too young for this place
<Stormy> =P
<Kjakings> Too young for a chat about a purple dragon?
<Yahoo> Meh
<Aicebo> It seems like this place is more named after a purple dragon than about a purple dragon
<Aicebo> Ahaha
<Yahoo> XD
<Stormy> Yeah
<Stormy> No one talks about Spyro
<Kjakings> We do, once in a blue moon
<Stormy> I shouldn't be a mod because I don't even like Spyro :P
<Yahoo> I thought this place is For the people that had joined the forum about the purple dragon XD
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: Yeah I figured that out, no worries
<Stormy> k
<Yahoo> Lol
<Stormy> What? :P
<Yahoo> What?
<Stormy> Lol what?
<Yahoo> What?!

<Stormy> It's not really... appropriate
<Yahoo> Have you heard the family sho thing
<Yahoo> Urgh
<Stormy> ...Or you can ignore me again. That works too.
<Stormy> Never heard of it
<Yahoo> GOOD
<Yahoo> You would most certianly kick it
<Yahoo> HA!
<Stormy> Another stupid bot?
<Yahoo> If you kicked Kieran when he was on another tab he will be quite peeved
<Yahoo> No
<Stormy> I'd just ban it, but Things and Spyrorocks would probably kill me
<Yahoo> Its one of Terminator's sayings
<Stormy> Oh
<Yahoo> Its the second part which is.....disturbing
<Spyrorocks> happy?
<Rurik> D:

<Yahoo> Stormy: http://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm394/YahootheDragon/hallo002.jpg Look who's on the right lol
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: why did they take your laptop?
<Yahoo> That was last year
<Stormy> Yahoo: Who's that?
<Kjakings> I only just noticed lol
<Yahoo> RD12
<Stormy> Spyrorocks: I still have it.
<Aicebo> XD
<Stormy> I just asked them to block the internet
<Aicebo> Why?
<Yahoo> http://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm394/YahootheDragon/hallo002.jpg Buttons and COco
<Yahoo> *Coco
<Yahoo> NO
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: why???
<Yahoo> WRONG PICTURE!
<Yahoo> http://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm394/YahootheDragon/IMG_0910.jpg
<Yahoo> Buttons and Coco
<Stormy> Because I'll use the internet less if they do
<Spyrorocks> I see
<Stormy> Or so was my theory
<Stormy> But it's not working
<Stormy> :P
<Spyrorocks> lol, addiction
<Stormy> Yeah, oh well :D
<Yahoo> http://i317.photobucket.com/albums/mm394/YahootheDragon/IMG_0642.jpg I hate Alex.......................................... (the guy to the right)
<Yahoo> Deathbat to the very very left
<Stormy> I think I'll stay on at least until my brother comes and asks for the computer
<Yahoo> Yes with the black slipknot shirt
<Stormy> Or I could go read Eclipse by Stephanie Meyer
<Stormy> :P
<Spyrorocks> heh
<Aicebo> Stormy: LOL
<Stormy> Aicebo: Haha, I know
<Stormy> They're crappy books, but I read them anyway
<Aicebo> Exactly
<Stormy> It's like a guilty pleasure
<Aicebo> They're just time passers
<Aicebo> I'm ashamed to say that I liked the series
<Yahoo> Everyone at school carries a bloody twilight book around as if it's a bible
<Stormy> I know a few girls like that
<Yahoo> I think that's how Christianity came to be actually
<Stormy> Thankfully not too many
<Spyrorocks> I think I should watch the movie to see what all the fuss is about
<Aicebo> The movie was OK
<Stormy> Don't bother
<Stormy> You wouldn't be interested
<Aicebo> I saw it once but I had to see it a second time...e__e
<Aicebo> That thing's going on DVD sort of fast
<Stormy> I don't think I even want to see the movie
<Aicebo> It's on DVD in March
<Spyrorocks> "hey brad, what are you doing?" "watching a movie about a vampire dude who wears a lot of makeup."
<Stormy> If the book sucks, I hate to imagine how much the movie must suck.... D:
<Aicebo> The movie was decent
<Stormy> Really?
<Aicebo> They cut out Bella's crap about how "handsome and angelic" he is
<Stormy> Oh, seriously?
<Aicebo> Since you can't really hear her mind anyways
<Stormy> I might have to see the movie then
<Stormy> That was seriously annoying me
<Aicebo> They don't even look like they sparkle...
<Aicebo> lol...
<Stormy> Stupid Edward fangirls....
<Aicebo> OH
<Aicebo> One moment..
<Yahoo> I know one girl that read ALL the books a year before the movie came out
<Aicebo> .
<Spyrorocks> DID U SAY EDWARD?
<Spyrorocks> OMGOMGOMG
<Stormy> OMG LYKE YA HES SO HAWT
<Yahoo> She went to start bitching about the movie XD
<Stormy> :D:D:D:D:D
<Spyrorocks> TOTALLY

<Stormy> http://edward-cullen.net/
<Spyrorocks> is it a forum?
<Stormy> Seriously, read some of the comments
<Yahoo> I was crying when I saw Bolt yesturday...
<Spyrorocks> I refuse to see Bolt because id be indirectly supporting miley cyrus
<Stormy> I don't think there's a forum
<Aicebo> Spyrorocks: Same
<Stormy> Too bad, I wanted to join D:
<Stormy> Aicebo: Same
<Stormy> "jordan: i love edward more than any og u i have read twilight seres 7 times FOR EDWARD!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE U EDWARD!!!"
<Spyrorocks> hahahaha
<Yahoo> Buut it I couldnt help but mock Miiley's poor voice acting skills
<Aicebo> http://roflrazzi.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/celebrity-pics-kaulitz-fail.jpg
<Stormy> "Bella: I love you edward! You are so so hot! YOU DEFINATELY DAZZLE ME!!!"
<Spyrorocks> if there was a forum we could all register and tell them how much we love edward
<Stormy> OH
<Rurik> Speaking of Miley, I saw someone with the same username as her on WoW last night. I killed her :P
<Stormy> Someone on Neoseeker posted this funny Twilight thing
<Stormy> I'll see if I can find it

<Stormy> The "You have no lives" one is so like them :P
<Spyrorocks> hahaha
<Yahoo> ...................bored
<Aicebo> I was so embarrased in borders when my step-uncle's daughter kept "ooh-ing" and "aaah-ing" at the Twilight merch shelf
<Aicebo> I had to stand near it
<Aicebo> *cries*
<Yahoo> I would kick her
<Stormy> http://shinga.deviantart.com/art/Head-Trip-Twilight-Sucks-85504254
<Kjakings> You're the one who went to see Bolt Yahoo
<Yahoo> Or throw one of the bloody books at her head
<Yahoo> yeah, but my mum wanted to watch it so I had to anyway
<Aicebo> Nah
<Aicebo> My parents wanted to see Bolt
<Aicebo> But I refused to go
<Stormy> It doesn't even sound that good
<Stormy> Even without Miley Cyrus in it, I wouldn't be interested.
<Aicebo> Anyways I would've said something to her but I've known her since I was born n shit
<Aicebo> Yeah
<Aicebo> "OOH LOOK AT ME I THINK I HAVE SUPER POWERS I'MMA TRAVEL BACK TO WHERE I STARTED BCUZ I'M MAGICAL"
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: love the comic
<Stormy> It's not mine
<Aicebo> I seen that comic before
<Stormy> I wish I could take credit for its brilliance, though
<Stormy> But I fail at drawing people
<Spyrorocks> I know its not yours
<Spyrorocks> But it was funny
<Stormy> I'd favorite it, but I'm trying to clear out my favorites on my dA account
<Yahoo> Why?
<Stormy> It won't let me delete some
<Stormy> I don't want the account anymore
<Yahoo> Lol
<Stormy> I realized that I can't draw :P
<Stormy> What? Now it's not letting me delete my own art?
<Stormy> D:
<Yahoo> http://fc24.deviantart.com/fs41/f/2009/051/3/f/Adipose_plushie_by_The_Paper_Lady_42.jpg I. WANT. ONE.
<Yahoo> Lumps of human fat!
<Spyrorocks> odd...
<Spyrorocks> I cant draw at all
<Spyrorocks> Not one bit
<Aicebo> http://shinga.deviantart.com/art/Head-Trip-Breaking-Dawn-98016573 slightly innapropriate but funny. Just read the grandma/kid's expressions
<Spyrorocks> well, i can draw stickmen
<Stormy> It won't load the full view
<Stormy> Oh, never mind :P
<Aicebo> "I'm nine years old and I'm setting myself up for disappointment! *grin*"
<Icydragon> Woah.
<Spyrorocks> LOL @ sparkly vampire babies
<Aicebo> I know it's terrible XD
<Stormy> Her ex-boyfriend falls in love with the baby?
<Stormy> WTF?
<Aicebo> Jacob.
<Aicebo> HAHAHA THAT'S SAD
<Stormy> I figured, but how does he fall in love with a baby?
<Stormy> O___________________o
<Yahoo> Doesnt it grow up quicker or something?
<Spyrorocks> Its fiction, it doesnt need to be moral or make sense
<Stormy> I guess not, but still
<Spyrorocks> (that was a joke)\
<Stormy> I thought Jacob was one of the only /sane/ characters
<Yahoo> So that'll be why most girls in my classdont like my fiction stories
<Stormy> o___O
<Yahoo> (yes, 21/22 are twilight fans)
<Stormy> Come on, stupid "art", delete already D:
<Stormy> >(

<Rurik> Just press delete on everything
<Spyrorocks> you can delete your whole account
<Rurik> that's what I did to unwanted things
<Stormy> And I have to have a subscription to remove the box
<Spyrorocks> im pretty sure
<Stormy> It's saying there's an error when I try
<Yahoo> Try tomorrow
<Spyrorocks> phone dA and tell them if they dont remove your account you will sue them for hosting your copyrighted content.
<Stormy> But I want my crappy art off the internet now D:
<Spyrorocks> thats what I do when people host pics I dont like on imageshack

<Stormy> What would that do?
*Stormy is stupid
<Yahoo> I do not know
<Stormy> Eh, I'll try it anyway
<Yahoo> I just heard it would help most errors on dA somehow
<Stormy> I'll just tell it not to delete my saved passwords
<Stormy> Though maybe I should... I think my mom was on my facebook account yesterday
<Stormy> Bah, how do you clear cache again? =P

<Aicebo> GAAAAAAAAAAAABE
<Aduro> i'd perfer power metal...thank you
<Catabatus> Bleh. Metal.
<Aicebo> Aduro: you don't know what real metal is
<Catabatus> I despise pop, metal, "punk" and rap
<Aduro> such as Rhapsody, or Dragonforce....
<Aicebo> Real Metal = WHITESNAKE + FASTER P***YCAT <333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
<Catabatus> This little 4th grader at my school said she had a pet dragon
<Aicebo> "Brace yourself, chick" "BRACE YOURSELF CONRAD BIRDIE! *punch*" "Hugo, you hit him! I never want to see you again! *cries*"
<Aicebo> lolololololololol
<Catabatus> Heh heh heh
<Aicebo> Oh no...
<Aduro> I can share with you, my personal favorite song by Rhapsody
<Aicebo> Swaffy's on...
<Aicebo> *cries*
<Aduro> "Wisdom of the Kings"
<Catabatus> D:
<Catabatus> S-swaffy?
<Aduro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9wIs8roKy8
<Aduro> Live performance too...
<Aicebo> ....that's not metal
<Aduro> there are different Styles of metal
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSvFVIyRDgs = real metal, original metal
<Aicebo> So there
<Aicebo> :P
<Catabatus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpHLEm9-0bg ...what? WHAT? Someone said THIS was Pop!
<Aduro> That first one isn't metal...
<Aicebo> Aduro: It was the FIRST METAL
<Aicebo> ORIGINAL
<Aicebo> FROM THE 80'S
<Aicebo> YOU CAN'T DENY IT :P
<Catabatus> Not the crap that y'all listen to today
<Aduro> yes....but its not the metal of the Nowadays
<Aicebo> Catabatus: HEY
<Aicebo> >___>
<Aicebo> *cries*
<Aicebo> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-260170.html#260170
<Aduro> here's an example of the metal Nowadays
<Aduro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvquWIULIFA
<Catabatus> I said that the song you, Aicebo, posted wasn't the crap that y'all listent o nowadays
<Catabatus> *to
<Aduro> Heroes of Our time, By Dragonforce....
<Aicebo> Catabatus: I love modern day music too
<Catabatus> ...When I said that I was reffering to rap and "metal"
<Aduro> Rap isn't considered music
<fresh_blood> It isnt music, its abysmal
<Catabatus> I've never listened to Dragonforce, and just by listening to that song I can tell I don't like them
<fresh_blood> I only like one Dragonforce song
<Aduro> its considered something between Poetry and Music....but its neither
<Catabatus> I don't consider rap music either, I just - Oh, forget it
<Aduro> it freaking sucks ass....I don't know why it even exists
<Aduro> Fresh_blood: whats the DF song you like?
<Aicebo> Not all rap is bad.
<Aduro> in all honesty...I don't like any of it...
<fresh_blood> Through the fire and flames...like almost everyone else who heard of Dragonforce because of Guitar Hero...
<Aduro> I heard that song first....actually...before GH3
<fresh_blood> I said ''almost'
<Aduro> then, I started listening to more of their music...now I like all of it....
<Aduro> and I even have gained a liking for Rhapsody when I listened to Emerald Sword
<Aduro> it died in here again
<fresh_blood> lol and unfortunately I have to go, might be back later though
<Catabatus> I'm actually drawing a... a.... a WOLF
<Aduro> Well, I'm getting off of here, so I can focus on my writing....
<Catabatus> *gulp*
<Catabatus> Bye
<Things> I think
<Aduro> Later everyone, I May be back
<Things> Imma make a channel
<Things> with like 10 eggdrops
<Things> :D
<Things> Unless thats gonna slow down my connection to all fuck
<Things> but its just IRC, so I guess not
<Aicebo> He annoys me
<Catabatus> Gah...
<Catabatus> He annoys me, too
<Catabatus> So... what happened to your conversation with that religious guy?
<Aicebo> She got off
<Aicebo> Let me check my messages
<Aicebo> No reply
<Catabatus> Not only are people morons, but they are also small minded
<Aicebo> lol
<Aicebo> if Swaffy or any religious nut were to tell me I'm wrong then I'll go make them watch Prayers for Bobby
<Aicebo> Sad movie
<Aicebo> It's true though
<Aicebo> :D
<Catabatus> Huh... never heard of it
<Aicebo> It's so sad
<Aicebo> I'll get the trailer
<Aicebo> In fact I was showing it to my best friend cuz we were on the subject of religious nuts earlier
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBVcTCpKx3g
<Catabatus> The reason Europeans even came to America in the first place was so they could have religious freedom
<Catabatus> I wonder whatever happened to that...
<Aicebo> LOL yeah

<Aicebo> Banned for 5 days from the site for that
<Aicebo> I wouldn't have minded if she didn't say "Go die"
<RedDragonX> I prolly would have perm banned lol
<TornWings> there are certain people you should never trust with ban-power... I'm definetly one of them.
<RedDragonX> just follow the rules...not that hard
<TornWings> you'd think... but apparently it's too much to ask for some
<RedDragonX> hence why he doesn't pick people like that to be mods lol
<Prince-Dari> Lawl
<Prince-Dari> Hail = Ban
<Aicebo> OH OH OH DARI

<Catabatus> Ember
<Catabatus> lol, you showed Dari my SpyroxFlame pic
<Aicebo> We should convert people to SxF and have a fan base
<TornWings> .....no
<Catabatus> Yes
<Aicebo> Since TLoS ended the way everyone wanted it to end (because they just took all the fan's ideas) they can make a Spyro romance game where he and Flame are in LOOOOOVE <3
<Catabatus> LYK ZOMG YAOI?
<Prince-Dari> All Spyro fanbases will end up with "OMFG THEIR MAD FIR ECH OTER!"
<Catabatus> /brick'd
<TornWings> ....and if that happens I will smash every copy of that game I ever find
<Catabatus> Gay pairings FTW
<Aicebo> TornWings: Why?
<Aicebo> Are you overly str*ight?
<TornWings> because I can
<Zephyr-kun> I vote yes on proposition #1 xD
*Catabatus holds up a sign saying "NO ON 8"
*Aicebo does too
*TornWings holds up a sign saying "I like pie!"
<Prince-Dari> WTH is 8?
<Zephyr-kun> Well..... accept add CyrilxVolteer to it xD
<Catabatus> No! Ignitus/Volteer!
<Zephyr-kun> But Cyri and Volty are perfect for each other xD
<Aicebo> Prince-Dari: There's a thing that went on in California about Gay Rights
<Zephyr-kun> Iggy's to serious >_<
<TornWings> ....
<Catabatus> Ignitus... slash... Volteer...
<Catabatus> I even support two of my female OC's being together
<Zephyr-kun> Fine. Have your own opinions. But Volteer will always go with Cyril =P
<Catabatus> Even though I never planned on it
<Zephyr-kun> Nice
<TornWings> <.<
<Catabatus> Sing with me now.
<Catabatus> Sha-la-la-la-la-la
<Catabatus> My, oh, my
<Catabatus> Look at the girl too shy

<Catabatus> >.>
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVrVn7tN-2o this is kind of creepy...
<Catabatus> Oh... I remember that
<Catabatus> Well, at least it's the old Crash
<Zephyr-kun> Huh..... I should have paid a bit more attention.
*Catabatus peers at Crash
<Catabatus> Eurgh...
<Catabatus> Aicebo: Ooh! You BANNED Hail?!
<Aicebo> Yes
<Aicebo> Look at what she said to me
*Catabatus slaps Aicebo on the back, accidentally knocking her over
<Aicebo> :/
<Catabatus> :s
<Zephyr-kun> "Mmm..... mmm...... pork chops and applesauce!" Wha? 0_0
<Catabatus> *twitch*
<Catabatus> "*looks at Aceedwin* Your kinda on some nerves there arn't ya? *Shoots Aceedwin just for fun/he doesn't die it was a toy gun...kinda*"
<Catabatus> ^ Major fail
<Catabatus> Wolfgurl989 annoys me
<Zephyr-kun> lol
<Aicebo> She annoys me, too
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9aOfS9CHVs this person's pretty good
<Catabatus> o: Anyone who can draw with a marker is good
<TornWings> hmm
<Aicebo> awh the second one is cute
<Zephyr-kun> Whoever that is is Scale Drawing. I fail at drawing, but I can make a perfect look-alike of an Am. Drag. pic by using that
<TornWings> That reminds me... I should probably stop trying to draw with a pen.
<Catabatus> I'm so lame, I'm drawing my own characters in Animal Crossing style
*Catabatus snaps her fingers in everyone's faces. "OOH, SNAP!"
*TornWings removes Catabatus' fingers
*Catabatus sticks her thumbs in her pockets and walks away
<Catabatus> ...
<TornWings> you lose your digit privileges
<Catabatus> Thing.
<Catabatus> >.>
<Catabatus> Plegh
<Aicebo> They can draw one pretty cool Iggy
<Catabatus> It's... CHIBI
*Catabatus runs away screaming
<Aicebo> Doesn't look like it...
<Catabatus> It says "Chibi Ignitus"
<Aicebo> It SAYS that
<Aicebo> :P
<Aicebo> Ewww Cynder
<Catabatus> Yeah
<Catabatus> I stopped watching it after she started drawing...
<Catabatus> ...IT
<TornWings> ....
<Aicebo> lol
<TornWings> a bit hostile are we?
<Catabatus> Hostel.
<Aicebo> We should make a "We Hate Cynder" club :P lol
<Catabatus> Meowth, that's right!
<Catabatus> Or, as I like to say...
<Catabatus> Meowth, bitch.
<Aicebo> LOL
<Aicebo> That's awesome
<TornWings> ...

<Aicebo> I'll say.
<Catabatus> http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-8722-is-there-any-animated-characters-you-have-a-crush-on.html
<Aicebo> Someone has a crush on KIRBY
<Aicebo> D:
<Aicebo> And freaking "Wall-E"
<Aicebo> -___-
<Catabatus> I like Kirby, just not in that way
<Catabatus> ...Wall-E?
<Zephyr-kun> Wall-e?
<TornWings> Kirby wins

<Aicebo> That movie looks stupid..
<Catabatus> It's a great movie
<Catabatus> I love it, but... having a crush on Wall-E?
<TornWings> w/e.
<Catabatus> ...
<TornWings> ...well, I think I've had my share of spite for one day, I'm out
<Catabatus> Bye
<Zephyr-kun> Mmm, bye
<Catabatus> "PUT IT THIS WAY YOUR ALL WHACKY IF YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON A ANIMATED THING.....i say you need to get out more and get a life.....not that i can say anything but anywho...."
<Catabatus> Hey, I have a crush on the Hermit.
<Catabatus> ....
<Catabatus> Oh, crap. I've said too much.
<Zephyr-kun> The Hermit scares me... as soon as he started talking to Cynder I instantly think "Oh god rapist"...
<Catabatus> He's hawt
<Catabatus> ...
<Catabatus> (shit... I need to stop doing that)
<Zephyr-kun> Oh-kay then... *backs away slowly*
<Catabatus> >.>
<Aicebo> Wow...that "Gives You Hell" song is pretty stupid
<Aicebo> "When you come my way, I hope it gives you hell"
<Aicebo> What the HELL is that.
<Zephyr-kun> Wow
<Zephyr-kun> That's..... retarded on multiple levels
<Catabatus> Santa never gave ME hell...
<Catabatus> Not even when I put it on the top of my list!
<Aicebo> LOL
<Catabatus> Y'know, I'm really glad Santa isn't real
<Aicebo> Hahah yeah
<Catabatus> Who would want a strange man to climb down your chimney at night and leave things under your tree?
<Aicebo> I don't really like the idea of an old man breaking into my house now that I'm older and actually think about it
<Catabatus> Not only that, but he SEES YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING.
<Aicebo> and WATCHES you...
<Catabatus> He knows when you're awake

<Hail> so you can click it... and listen to it
<Hail> ?...
<
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo I told Yahoo not to tell her.
<Yahoo> Wait
<Aicebo> If it's private, why weren't you discussing in PM?
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo So she looked it up on wiki...
<Yahoo> Best on Video
<Yahoo> Aicebo

<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Well it wasn't.

<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Well I was thinking, since she worships you as a God, well why don't you give her a telling off, make sure she doesn't do anything like that again.
<Aduro> -.-'
<Yahoo> ....
<Yahoo> Its Best on Video
<Hail> http//:bestonvideo.com

<Hail> ill mess with it later
<Aicebo> Her ban is only 5 days and not eternity
<Hail> and edit it to make it sound coolz 8D
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Hmm...
<Aicebo> But if she makes another mistake like telling me to "GO DIE"..
<Hail> SPYROFORUM TOOLBARZ
*Hail clicks 8P
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo *Crosses fingers* Lawl
<Aicebo> lawl
<Yahoo> NINE VIEW *LE_GASP*

<Hail> lol
<Prince-Dari> "FIRE ZE MISSILES" "But I am le tired" "So take a nap, THEN FIRE ZE MISSILES"
<flame1996> Sacre Blue!
<Hail> teehee'
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Hail needs help, lol.
<Aduro> Hail's in a good mood....
<Prince-Dari> Aicebo She said that to Yahoo ---> "17:51 Hail http://www.mibbit.com/pb/wHI5sW does entergation or whatever mean what I think it means o.o"
<Prince-Dari> Aicebo Lol...Entergation...
<Aicebo> She does need help..
<Hail> yea actually i am in a good mood
<Hail> :)
<Prince-Dari> Aicebo ...Because she found out what "entergation" is...?
<Kjakings> Hell all
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Come back after running from me?
<Prince-Dari> How nice to see you.
<Hail> o.ohell?
<Kjakings> Hardly running, I went to play DOWII.
<Prince-Dari> And didn't let me reply to what you said.
<Aicebo> no
<Prince-Dari> Aicebo Why then?
<Aicebo> because she asks about every little freaking thing.
<Kjakings> That's your problem then isn't it.
<Prince-Dari> Aicebo Hm, meh.
<Prince-Dari> Nope.
<Aicebo> She needs help to learn to shut her fingers/mouth
<Prince-Dari> You ran, so you lose.
<Kjakings> If you say so, Captain America.
<Hail> lol
<Prince-Dari> Wow. The American thing again.
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings, can you actually have a proper argument without either BSing, repeating, or ignore/leaving
<Prince-Dari> ?
<Kjakings> Of course, the proper question though, is can you?
<Prince-Dari> Most people know I can, you don't because you always run before I get to have a proper argument.
<Hail> http://www.mibbit.com/pb/g1EV2R I was soooo bored.
<Kjakings> Right. Because you going "I win. You lose." whenever you run out of material, THAT's a proper argument.
<Hail> *readonlywithcaution*
<Hail> LOL.
<Prince-Dari> I didn't run out of material.
<Prince-Dari> I wasn't arguing yet.
<Kjakings> Other variations on this big bukkit of dariphail is "I win. You fail."
<Hail> huhuh
<Kjakings> Shush hail, those with intelligence higher than the average rock are speaking.
<Prince-Dari> And actually I said that after making a statement which disregarded you unthought piece of crap.
<Hail> (Away: Grabbing A Bite To Eat)
<Prince-Dari> your*
<Kjakings> Right. I believe you.
<Hail> (Away: Grabbing A Bite To Eat....McDonalds)
<Prince-Dari> I can copy paste if you want
<Yahoo> http://www.flyingratsass.net/ponies/images/hamsters.gif
<Prince-Dari> Kjakings: Fine, I'll say stuff, and back it up. Big-headed: Always seems to think he is above and beyond everyone else, seems to think his opinion is more important than anyone else's.
<Yahoo> Watch it
<Kjakings> Hold on, shouldn't we be putting our abilities to better use than random arguments? Like finding a loo-hole in the system to getting hail a perma ban.
<Prince-Dari> Well yes.
<Prince-Dari> But I find it hard not to argue when you agravate me.
<Kjakings> I find it hard to not aggrivate* you when it's so easy.
<Kjakings> Ok it was aggravate.
<Prince-Dari> I don't know why what you say does aggravate me.
<Prince-Dari> Probably because you leave before I get to respond.
<Prince-Dari> Or ignore me.
<Kjakings> I'm just that awesome. (Another dari response.)
<Prince-Dari> I've only said that once to a n00b.
<Hail|Away> YAY
<Hail|Away> Nao away to mcdonalds..
<Prince-Dari> No point wasting my time on them.
<Kjakings> True
<Prince-Dari> See. Even Hail likes McDonalds.
<Prince-Dari> That proves it fails.
<Kjakings> All Americans like McDonalds.
<Aduro> I don't like McDonalds
<Prince-Dari> And it is an American company.
<Aduro> and I'm american
<Kjakings> All americans like any food they cane shove down their gullets.
<Prince-Dari> Has to be at least 50% fat.
<Prince-Dari> And processed.
<Aduro> I like to stick with fruit...fresh fruit
<Kjakings> Bull
<Kjakings> No American eats fruit
<Aduro> I LOVE FRUIT!
<Kjakings> Bull
<Aduro> I eat fruit
<Yahoo> Lol
<Aduro> otherwise I don't eat
<Kjakings> Bull. Americans don't eat fruit, and they don't not eat.
<Prince-Dari> So you love this American company, that all Americans also love, because it allows them to shove crap down their throats, and you call me the American. Wrong. You are American. Going to play gunz now. (A Kjakings response.
<Yahoo> I do admit, I have seen Nigel eat fruit
<Aduro> I AM AMERICAN AND I EAT FRUIT!!!
<Kjakings> Quiet Yahoo, the people with an intelligence level above that of the average bullfrog are speaking.
<Yahoo> 18:26 Kjakings Quiet Yahoo, the people with an intelligence level above that of the average bullfrog are speaking. Get fucked
<Yahoo> Ooh wait for it

<Kjakings> I've got some shit to do now, Dari, get to work on finding that loophole.
<Kjakings> Also, does Steve have a ping-spam option?
<Prince-Dari> Hmm
<Prince-Dari> I'll add that. But I really am going to play gunz.
<Prince-Dari> Lawl.
<Kjakings> Ok
<Kjakings> You need to make Steve more user-friendly, so if I need to I can make him ping-spam or whatever people.

<DDR> That shouldn't affect you on the forum
<DDR> :
<DDR> * :|
<DragonFireOKN> Screenshot?
<Hail> Yes, Aicebo had a screenshot.
<Hail> Well, Aduro said she did.
<Kjakings> It's Aicebo DDR, she claims the rules don't apply to her. Even though we all know that's Stor- I DIDN'T SAY IT!
<Kjakings> :P
<DragonFireOKN> lol
<Hail> LOL
<Kjakings> Not that SR ever cares when we take the piss
*Hail found aicebo's PB
<Hail> MUAHAHAH
<Kjakings> Because if he did, it would just prove us right.
<Hail> :D
<DDR> Spyrorocks: You want to unban Hail from the forum?
<DDR> She didn't even do anything there...
<DDR> Hail, do you have the screenshot of what happened?
<Spyrorocks> I never banned her
<DDR> Am I talking to myslef here?
<DDR> I know, Aicebo did
<Hail> Hold on
<Hail> im searching for it DDR
<Hail> SR, Aicebo perma banned me from SF
<Hail> But my offense was on here.
<Hail> I called her some names :(
<Hail> and I apologized
<DragonFireOKN> I thought Perma-banning was banned for Mods.
<Hail> but she said she doesnt beleive it
<Hail> and doesnt care
<DragonFireOKN> Has that changeda?
<DragonFireOKN> ...
<Hail> ..
<DragonFireOKN> *changed
<Hail> she said she perma banned me
<Kjakings> Ban banning? Is that a contradiction of terms or something?
<DDR> Lol
<DragonFireOKN> You can ban the act of banning for some people to ban.
<Spyrorocks> Moderators are allowed to perma ban.
<DragonFireOKN> Stormy said she wasn't at one time. Must have mispoken.
<DragonFireOKN> Have you found the screenshot?
<Hail> aicebo has a picture of a penguin in spyrochat thigns catergory XD http://s248.photobucket.com/albums/gg185/Aicebo/Spyrochat%20Things/
*Hail is still searching
<Hail> ..
<Hail> not yet..
<Hail> its really full in her PB
<Hail> D:>
<Hail> Giving my laggy computer maor lag..
<Hail> *moar
<DragonFireOKN> *more
<Hail> MY GOD I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE
<Hail> BUT ILL KEEP LOOKING X_X
<DDR> I'm guessing you didn't save the picture?
<Hail> no
<Hail> my frickin god
<Hail> its not in here
<Hail> x_x
<DDR> If anything Aicebo should have just banned you from chat
<Hail> but yet im banned from SF
<Hail> i know :(
<Yahoo> Lol
<Hail> Critical Information
<Hail> You have been banned from this forum
<Hail> x_x
<Rurik> All I see is a sea of Hail spam
<Hail> yup its not in here
<Yahoo> Lol
<Hail> i checked all the folders
<Hail> No we are talking about a issue...
<DragonFireOKN> What did you call her?
<Hail> SR, can you unban me from SF?
<Hail> Aicebo permanently banned me, and it was on here that the incident happened...
<Hail> And she said "Bye bye forever." And there it was I was banned forever.
<DragonFireOKN> What did you say to her?
<Hail> I called her names..
<DragonFireOKN> Yeah....
<DragonFireOKN> And?
<Hail> all I did was call her names.
<DragonFireOKN> I know that
<DragonFireOKN> But what did you call her?
<Hail> Curse words.
<Hail> But yet im banned from SF FOREVER just for that.
<Hail> Do yo uagree with that? >_>
<Hail> *you agree
<DDR> Kjakings swears all the time
<DDR> XD
<Hail> Yes, yet if I swear I'm kicked out.
<DragonFireOKN> It might deserve a punishment of some sort but not a perma-ban
<Hail> I know.
<DDR> I mean, not that it's a good thing, but I don't think you should be banned from SF forever
<Hail> Like mabye a week ban from Spyrochat.
<Hail> I know.
<DragonFireOKN> Aicebo over-reacting as usual...
<DDR> ...-_-
<Hail> I spammed a couple bad words to her
<DragonFireOKN> That depends of course on what EXACTLY Hail said.
<Hail> And now Im banned forever
<Hail> Why forever?
<DDR> Meh, well I'll see you guys later
<Hail> And why on the forum?
<Hail> The incident happened here.
<DragonFireOKN> See ya, DDR.
<DDR> Bye everyone
<Hail> I would think mabye a 1 week ban from Spyrochat, but not banned from SF forever.
<Hail> That's sort of unfair.
<DragonFireOKN> It all depends on what SR thinks. There are no right on the internet.
<DragonFireOKN> *rights
<Hail> Spyrorocks?
<Spyrorocks> yes
<Hail> When he answers/comes on I'll ask him..
<Hail> Oh you are here
<Hail> hold on..
<Hail> Do you think it is fair that Aicebo banned me from Spyroforum forever just because of spamming some bad words to her? The incident happened here, so the punishment should be here, right? And, I don't think I deserve to be banned forever just because of that. Mabye I should be banned from Spyrochat for a week or so?
<Hail> ^ To Spyrorocks
<Spyrorocks> Spyroforum and spyrochat are linked.
<Hail> But she banned me forever..
<Hail> Just for that one incident
<DragonFireOKN> SR, off-topic, but did you get your DSL yet?
<Hail> :(
<Spyrorocks> DragonFireOKN: a week ago
<Hail> She banned me forever for that one incdent
<Hail> I dont think it should be forever.
<Hail> >_<
<Hail> ..but whatever you want :(

<Kjakings> Don't think so. Meh
<Spyrorocks> try it
<Spyrorocks> http://www.spyroforum.com/forum-trash.html

<Hail> Hello I am back
<spyro_master> hi
<Hail> hey
<Hail> DragonFireOKN, check your PMs on Mibbit.
<spyro_master> is it a good idea to create a new talk about anything thread? cause im thinking of doing one
<Hail> No, as Stormy will probably remove it and just throw it in Trash Bin again.
<DragonFireOKN> Topics like that always end in failure.
<Hail> its really hard when your banned *sighs*
<Hail> Lol, yeah they do.
<Hail> haha.
<Hail> DFOKN

<Aduro> Because noone loves me...
<Aduro> -.-'
<Kjakings> And no-one likes him either
<Aduro> :(
<Aduro> :'(
<Aduro> I'm sad...
<Kjakings> Truth hurts
<Aduro> and Unloved
<Kjakings> Unliked*
<Aduro> SAME THING!
<Kjakings> Not really
<Aduro> it just sounds better to say unloved
<Kjakings> Un-loved means no-one especially likes you, un-liked means no-one likes you on any level
<Kjakings> Apart from dis-like
<Aduro> then everybody dislikes be...
<Kjakings> No, everyone either dislikes or just doesn't care about you
<Aduro> by a show of hands, who doesn't like me?!
*DragonFireOKN starts to raise hand but waits to see who else will
*Kjakings raises both hands, feet, robotic arms, the magical limbs that sprout from his back and stands all of his weapons on end
*Rurik grows arms and raises them
<Kjakings> I have LOTS of weapons, although you can't see many of them do to their weapons-of-mass-destruction nature, and I don't want anyone wasitng them
*DragonFireOKN is guessing Kjakings most deadly weapons is his sitting ability
<Aduro> okay, now, who HATES me, by a show of hands
*Kjakings raises both hands, feet, robotic arms, the magical limbs that sprout from his back and stands all of his weapons on end
<DragonFireOKN> *weapon
*Rurik raises his hand
*Kjakings pins both of Aicebo's arms to the wall upright too
*DragonFireOKN fores prince-dari to raise his hand.
<DragonFireOKN> *forces
*DragonFireOKN gets all of his dwaggies to raise their "hands"
<Kjakings> Don't forget legs, tails and wings too
<DragonFireOKN> Mkay
<Aduro> well....apparently noone likes me...
<DragonFireOKN> Terminator would like you, if he was here.......glares at Aicebo
<magikal> Hai
<Kjakings> Hai Edina

<magikal> Anything is possible in Rainbowland!
<Aduro> Candy Mountain!
<DragonFireOKN> NOOO
<magikal> I don't like that place.
<magikal> They took one of my organs.
*DragonFireOKN hates Charlie
<Aduro> CHARLIE!!!!!!
*magikal has a kidney papercut
*DragonFireOKN sees no humor at all in that video.
<Aduro> GAHH!!! those Idiots took my freaking kidney
<magikal> me takes Aduro's second kidney.
<magikal> */me takes Aduro's second kidney.
<Kjakings> The only funny bit of that was "America's Highways: Is everything close enough to them?"
<spyro_master> lol
<magikal> lol
<magikal> It's funny at first
<Prince-Dari> ?
<Kjakings> Kick his ass.
<magikal> gtg
<Kjakings> Hack, spam, whatever.
*Aduro gets his kidney back and does surgery to get it back into place
<DragonFireOKN> Not funny at all
<Kjakings> Use everything in your arsenal - that's legal.
<DragonFireOKN> Stupid Charlie the Unicorn....
<Kjakings> That was the only restriction set by my benefactor. It has to be legal.
<Prince-Dari> Who is it?
<Aduro> my opinion...
<Aduro> its funny
<DragonFireOKN> Okay
<Kjakings> Random chinese hacker
<Aduro> but stupid at the same time
<Kjakings> He hacked one of our clan servers
<Prince-Dari> What game...?
*Aduro begins floating
<Kjakings> ALL of our clans servers actually, everything had to be shut down
<Kjakings> Gmod
<Kjakings> Just do it
<Kjakings> :P
<Prince-Dari> 0 Hosts on this IP
<Prince-Dari> He's not using it anymore.
<Kjakings> Then I shall go complain.
<spyro_master> wot is it with people and that stupid unicorn anyway?
<Kjakings> Ok he's offline
<Kjakings> :P
<Aduro> idk...
<Prince-Dari> Lol.
<Aduro> its stupid humor
<spyro_master> lol ok
<Aduro> thats why people watch it
<Kjakings> He probably has a dynamic
<spyro_master> oh so thats what its MEANT to be lol oh well
<DragonFireOKN> I find it stupid but in no way funny.
<Kjakings> Is there any way to track a dynamic or something? Finding out what it's changed to?
<Aduro> thats what makes it popular.....its like spongebob
<Prince-Dari> Dunno. Not really.
<DragonFireOKN> Spongebob has some funny lines.
<Aicebo> back
<DragonFireOKN> Charlie has no funny lines
<Prince-Dari> Because a dynamic IP address could be anyone in that area of China.
<Kjakings> You missed Edina
<Aduro> "put a banana in your ear!"
<DragonFireOKN> How is that funny?
<Aduro> idk

<Kjakings> Oh? What program do I have on?
*DragonFireOKN inserted a gremlin into Kjakings TV
<Prince-Dari> I can't see what program is on, I can just look out through the TV screen
<Kjakings> Then where is my computer desk in relation to the TV screen?
<Kjakings> Where is my book-case in relation to my bed?
<Prince-Dari> I can't see your desk.
<Prince-Dari> All I see is your bed.
<Kjakings> If you can't see my desk then you can't see me.
<Prince-Dari> Nope...
<DragonFireOKN> What side of the room is his Brittany Spears poster?
<Kjakings> o_O
<DragonFireOKN> That should be easy
<spyro_master> lol giv up dari
<Prince-Dari> That's above his bed.
<Kjakings> You die now DFOKN
<DragonFireOKN> I can see several.
<DragonFireOKN> And a life-size Michael Jackson doll
<Kjakings> What colour is the wall behind the bed?
<Prince-Dari> LOL
<Prince-Dari> LOLOLOLOL
<spyro_master> lol
<Prince-Dari> DragonFireOKN: Under the bed, right?
<Kjakings> ...
<DragonFireOKN> Yep
<Prince-Dari> Yeah.
<spyro_master> a colour thats used in the colour spectrum
<Prince-Dari> Didn't notice it there before.
<DragonFireOKN> So his mom won't get jealous
<Kjakings> AHAH! I win, you can't get under my bed, solid wood.
<Prince-Dari> X-ray, Kjakings.
<Prince-Dari> It's only a thin layer of wood.
<Kjakings> Then how did it get IN there?
<Prince-Dari> You can lift it up
<Kjakings> ... How many shelves are to the left of the bed, counting the top one.
<Prince-Dari> Oh and the wall is orange.
<Kjakings> Nope. The wall is greem
<Kjakings> green*
<Prince-Dari> Lies.
<Prince-Dari> It's orange.
<Yahoo> Lol
<Kjakings> Green
<Prince-Dari> Orange.
<spyro_master> lol
<DragonFireOKN> *green
<Kjakings> Green
<Prince-Dari> Orange.
<Kjakings> Green
<spyro_master> orangy green
<Prince-Dari> Greem = Orange
<Yahoo> BROWN
<Prince-Dari> Therefore you agree.
<Aicebo> Bored...
<Yahoo> Lol
<Kjakings> Why are the guys in QI wearing Star-Trek uniforms? o_O
<spyro_master> every colour has everycolour in it you know
<spyro_master> lol
<Prince-Dari> Not necessarily.
<spyro_master> QI is funny
<spyro_master> oh no thats hair
<spyro_master> soz
<Prince-Dari> Red doesn't have anything but red in it.
<DragonFireOKN> There is no color as there are too many Stormy, MJ, and B-Spears posters to see
<Prince-Dari> Blue has nothing but blue in it.
<Prince-Dari> Yellow has nothing but yellow in it.
<spyro_master> yes alright
<spyro_master> i get ur point
<Prince-Dari> All other colours are made of those three.
<Prince-Dari> I win.
<spyro_master> i meant hair colours
<Prince-Dari> You lose.
<spyro_master> lol ok
<Kjakings> What about white?
<Prince-Dari> White is a mixture of all 3.
<Kjakings> Isn't that only in light?
<spyro_master> they arent wearing star treck uniforms
<Prince-Dari> It makes white, believe it or not.
<DragonFireOKN> What about clear?
<DragonFireOKN> :p
<Prince-Dari> Clear isn't a colour.
<Prince-Dari> I win.
<spyro_master> r u watching bbc2 or DAVE
<Prince-Dari> Go on, laugh daily.
<Kjakings> What about black? Isn't black a lack of colour, which is a contradiction of terms?
<spyro_master> lol
<Prince-Dari> No idea what black is.
<Prince-Dari> I think you're right though.
<Kjakings> Like saying water is tasteless. Tasteless is a taste. Giving someone without a name the name 'nameless' giving them a name, which makes the name nameless pointless.
<DragonFireOKN> Clear is a color: For example. *Flicks Kjakings in the nose* *runs past screen door (washed with Oxyclean) and closes it* *Kjakings slams into it.*
<Yahoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ejk5NOrR8 Lol
<Prince-Dari> So darkness is...Nothing?
<Prince-Dari> Darkness is a lack of light.
<Prince-Dari> So darkness doesn't exist.
<Yahoo> Its the other term for nothingness
<Prince-Dari> So black isn't actually a colour.
<Prince-Dari> Black doesn't exist.
<Prince-Dari> Black is a lack of colour.
<Prince-Dari> So.
<Prince-Dari> WTH?
<Prince-Dari> How does that work?
<Prince-Dari> Black doesn't exist...
<Prince-Dari> O_o
<Yahoo> Your thinking too hard dari
<Kjakings> I dunno, temporal paradoxes are fun though. ^^
<Yahoo> Stop it
<Prince-Dari> So if the colour black comes from darkness, which is nothing, black doesn't exist.
<Yahoo> Wait, that means our text doesnt exist
<Prince-Dari> So black...Is a lack of white...?
<Prince-Dari> As darkness is a lack of light?
<Aicebo> http://aicebo.deviantart.com/art/Very-Proud-Of-Ya-Spyro-Version-113612068 http://www.punkrockcds.com/images/AFI-VeryProudOfYa.jpg compare :P

*DragonFireOKN now wants Rice Crispes.
*DragonFireOKN goes and gets some
<spyro_master> im going to get honey cheerios
<Prince-Dari> As different colours of light travel at different speeds.
<Prince-Dari> Does that mean that different colour lasors are more powerful than each other?
<Prince-Dari> So red is the least powerful
<Kjakings> "<Alan says something>" "Oh yeah, I rememebr seeing something like that on a program called QI." "-_-" "Yeah, well remembered Alan. It's not a well-known show."

<Aicebo> I look like a rainbow today
<Kjakings> No. No-one cares, and I'm in the middle of an argument and watching QI
<Prince-Dari> You do not speak for everyone. People do have their own opinions.
<Aicebo> A bright neon rainbow
<Aicebo> :D
<Kjakings> You know what's fun?
<Kjakings> Noticing how much Aicebo mentions Neon, or neon-coloured things, in relation to how much she mentions Edina. Neon > Edina.
<spyro_master> QI RULES!

<Kjakings> NOW.
<spyro_master> im not doing anything wrong
<Prince-Dari> I wonder if there are forums where being a n00b is against the rules...
<Aicebo> Prince-Dari: Mine is
<Aicebo> Both of mine
<Prince-Dari> Hahaha.
<Aicebo> But I still have n00bs anyways
<Aicebo> *shrug*
<Kjakings> Aicebo: Is specifically annoying/winding up users to see their reactions a good enough reasons for a kick?
<Aicebo> Yes.
<Kjakings> a good enough reason*
<Kjakings> Wheee.
<Aicebo> :D
<Kjakings> I love my loop-hole-alilic mind sometimes.
<DragonFireOKN> So, if n00bs was against the rules, who on SF should be banned?
<DragonFireOKN> Besides SR.
<DragonFireOKN> :)
<Prince-Dari> Loooool
<Prince-Dari> Such a long list.
<Keby> lol
<Kjakings> 99% of the 2300-odd members.
<Aicebo> Oh and since I'm admin of POR we don't really allow n00bs there either
<Keby> i just read what everyone said
<spyro_master> hi back
<Kjakings> No shit sherlock
<Prince-Dari> Hail, Malefor, spyro_master, all wolf lover/obsessors, all annoying fans.
<Prince-Dari> Uhh...

<Aicebo> Where are Kjaking's BLOODY PADS?
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Lawl
<spyro_master> im only bad at spelling on here as i try to type fast to keep up, whereas like this its ok
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Yeah, it seems to be his time of the month.
<Aicebo> He's ultra pissed because all his pads are bloody and I took the last fresh one :P
<Kjakings> Bullshit
<Kjakings> You're five years old.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Say to him "God, did you run out of tampons or something" Or sanitary towels, whatever. :P
<Aicebo> Not only that, but he ran out of his Hanny Montanny ones :P
<Aicebo> Kjakings: I'm sorry all your pads are bloody, here's some new ones :D
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo That's creepy.
<spyro_master> sigh i cannot be bothered to argue with people i don't know, as it is pointless to do so and i don't care what you think i am 16
<Aicebo> They have freaking toothpaste and toothbrushes
<Aicebo> Pads are bound to be next.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Eurgh. Hannah Montanna in your mouth. O_o
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Creepy, lawl.
<Kjakings> Meh. I have better things to do than argue the truth to someone.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: Nope. There is no proof.
<Kjakings> Aicebo, you still have those Ignitus232 pastebins?
<Aicebo> Yes, but I'm too lazy to get them right now.
<Prince-Dari> I want to see.
<Prince-Dari> Get them please.
<Prince-Dari> (I said please. Come on, not often you see that. :P)
<Aicebo> maybe later.
<Prince-Dari> Meh.
<Aicebo> What a paragraph, DragonFireOKN
<Aicebo> :P
<Prince-Dari> ?
<Aicebo> His name is still read
<Aicebo> After like 5 mins
<Aicebo> Hahaha
<Aicebo> *red
<Prince-Dari> Oh.
<Aicebo> He probably has a letter in there..
<Aduro> lol
<Aicebo> :/
<spyro_master> is this proof enough: Location: Oxfordshire, England/UK Occupation: At school Interests: Mastering Spyro games Gender: Male Birthday: 04 Feb 1993
<Aduro> otherwise he has one sentence in there...he may of just had to leave for a moment
<DragonFireOKN> My list: Hail, Malefor, Ratchet, Spyro Master, Hail, Malefor, SF_55, etc.
<DragonFireOKN> I was spazzing out in front of my TV.
<Prince-Dari> And why?
<DragonFireOKN> That's why it took so long
<Kjakings> You put Malefor twice.
<DragonFireOKN> My archrivals favorite College Hoops team went DOWN to a team my team beat earlier in the year by 40. :) :) :)
<DragonFireOKN> Malefor is a Super-n00b
<Prince-Dari> ...Huh?
<DragonFireOKN> Hail is an Uber-n00b
<Aicebo> SF55 is a friend of mine.
<Prince-Dari> You have friends who are n00bs, lul.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<DragonFireOKN> Yeah, I was finding someone's name who was familiar
<spyro_master> its off my profile on spyro forum
<DragonFireOKN> That was the only one.
<spyro_master> ok let get the one of msn
<DragonFireOKN> :p
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<Aicebo> spyro_master: That's just text, not proof.
<Aduro> See, I was right...
<spyro_master> erm
<Aicebo> Text that you wrote yourself
<spyro_master> how do i prove it then?
<Aicebo> NO PROOF
<Aicebo> -___-
<Aicebo> Act your age, that's a start.
<spyro_master> ok
*DragonFireOKN never acts 16.
<DragonFireOKN> Except when I act like a clown at Basketball games
<DragonFireOKN> Or when I'm doing MMA
<spyro_master> i don't act like a 16 year old i admit that
<spyro_master> but its who i am
<spyro_master> i dont act my age
<Aicebo> Best you start now.
<Aduro> I don't act my age either
<Aicebo> -__-
<Prince-Dari> I don't act like a 16 year old, I admit that.*
<Aicebo> I force myself to act older than I am.
<spyro_master> yeah well you miss out on being a kid then
<Aicebo> You can too.
<DragonFireOKN> If you didn't know Hail_the_Fail_Dragon's age, what would you guess?
<Aduro> I am sixteen, and I act younger or older, depending on the situation
<Kjakings> I don't often act what is considered 'right' for children my age at my school.
<spyro_master> i act older when im at school but on here i act younger as its how i am
<Kjakings> Because I'm neither chav nor pike.
<Prince-Dari> I would always guess younger for you, Aduro
<Aicebo> There's no difference between a kid, a teenager, and an adult other than maturity. I'd much rather act older than be purposely obnoxious and have everyone hate me.
<Aicebo> DragonFireOKN: Seven.
<spyro_master> i wouldnt really mind if everyone hated me for how i wanted to be liek, its my choice
<DragonFireOKN> Aicebo: Older guys have facial hair. :)
<DragonFireOKN> Like me
<Aicebo> DragonFireOKN: I wasn't talking about looks :P
<Aduro> i'd rather act like that...but I usually act older...
<Aduro> its just that...I'm a Spaz
<Prince-Dari> Not really. You always act younger.
*DragonFireOKN combs his mustache
<Aicebo> Umm, no you aren't.
<Aicebo> I am the spazz of this site. A decent one.
<Prince-Dari> I would never guess you to be 16, or older.
<Aicebo> You don't spazz.
<DragonFireOKN> I object.
<Aicebo> you just freak out about FANFICTION *lykomg*
<Aicebo> =/
<DragonFireOKN> The biggest spaz is BY FAR Chanserv.
<DragonFireOKN> He always is acting up
<Prince-Dari> God, ChanServ.
<spyro_master> i dont judge people by their ages i just talk to them i dont mind really what their age is
<Prince-Dari> I HATE HIM SO MUCH
<Prince-Dari> Always denying me access
<Prince-Dari> /kickban Hail
<Prince-Dari> /kb Hail
<spyro_master> its who they are , as a person, you cant judge a perosn just by their age
<Prince-Dari> /kb Hail #spyrochat
<Aicebo> spyro_master: We aren't.
*DragonFireOKN pictures a room with all the bots in it laughing at the people who want inside to get at something.
<Prince-Dari> /kb #spyrochat Hail
<Kjakings> Not all the bots DFOKN
<Prince-Dari> /ban Hail
<Aicebo> We're judging you by your goddamn maturity. You're aren't sixteen. You don't know the difference.
<Kjakings> Because then Steve could get in, which is essentially dari
<Prince-Dari> !ban Hail
<Prince-Dari> -ChanServ- You are not authorized to perform this operation.
<DragonFireOKN> ...
<Prince-Dari> Thwarted by ChanServ again.
<Prince-Dari> Evil ChanServ.
<DragonFireOKN> !ban Hail
<Prince-Dari> He should die.
<Aicebo> !ban Hail
<Aicebo> :D
<Aicebo> :P
<Aicebo> !unban Hail
<Kjakings> !funban Hail
<Aduro> Prince-Dari: why would you think I'm younger than sixteen....if I was any younger, I wouldn't be so freaking perverted...
<DragonFireOKN> We should get Terminator to replace Chanserv, and Chuck Norris to replace SR.
<spyro_master> ok then im not mature yet, oh well plenty of years to anyway
<Aicebo> Chuck Norris sux
<Kjakings> HEATHEN
<DragonFireOKN> O_______________________________O
<Prince-Dari> Not really, I'm younger and still have a very dirty mind.
<Kjakings> BURN HER!
<DragonFireOKN> You........
<DragonFireOKN> You.........................
<spyro_master> not in that way dari
<Prince-Dari> Yep.
<Prince-Dari> In that way.
<Aduro> But I am indeed Sixteen
<Kjakings> Aduro: I'm younger than dari, and I have a dirty mind. Not to rival his, although it's close.
<Aicebo> Aduro: No, you're 13.
<Prince-Dari> But don't act it.
<Things> Prince-Dari?
*DragonFireOKN is disturbed in the head.
<spyro_master> im mature in that way i know about those things but i choose not to use that information in jokes etc
<DragonFireOKN> But aren't all smart people somewhat insane? *Toasts Dari*
<spyro_master> as its just seems stupid to me, but i admit can be funny sometimes
<Aduro> Aicebo: No I am not....otherwise I wouldn't be able to take my GED
<Prince-Dari> Things: If different colour light, travels at different speed, does that mean lasors of different colours have varying power?
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/stream?u=BrianObsessed&amp;i=0 RAWR
<Aicebo> Aduro: 13.
<Aduro> Aicebo: Prove that I am thirteen, then?
<Kjakings> SOMEWHAT? If insanity is a measure of intelligence, then I am smarter than all strangely-super-intelligent furs (Tails from Sonic the hedgehog - 453 IQ), super intelligent super villains, super intelligent sidekicks, and real life geniuses combined.
<Aicebo> Aduro: You act like an immature 13 year old boy. There.
<DragonFireOKN> No, I am more insane than you, Kjakings
<Prince-Dari> There's only one way to settle this.
*Prince-Dari goes to Steve
<Prince-Dari> The insanity meter.
<spyro_master> what?
*Aicebo is bored on YT
<Things> Nope, a mw = a mw, really the only thing different is what absorbs the light. Like for red, black and brown coloured things burn well, but lighter coloured things dont, whereas green can burn most lighter coloured things (with the right power)
<DragonFireOKN> I spent my boring school classes postulating how to murder someone and get away with it.
<Things> There is a gas laser that works in the deep deeep deep IR range, which can cut clear plastic
<Aduro> Aicebo: Just because I act like something, doesn't mean I am that, For a fact, I am Sixteen, and I have an I.Q. over 200, but I lack the attention-span to use it.
<Things> As the plastic is opaque to it lol
<Prince-Dari> ...Gas Laser...?
<DragonFireOKN> Right now: You stab them with something wooden and then burn the body with the wood. No trace.
<Things> Yeah
<Kjakings> DFOKN: You're all of the above, and then combined with me. Lol.
<Aicebo> Aduro: So you use a random IQ test site? That's not official. IQs are also useless.
<DragonFireOKN> Aicebo: Wrong
<Things> Big glass tube filled with a special mixture of gas, and one side with a mirror, and the other side with a semi-reflective mirror
<DragonFireOKN> Most IQ tests online are fake
<DragonFireOKN> BUT
<Kjakings> Wow. You left dari speechless. I WANT A GAS LAZ0R.
<Rurik> It's almost impossible to have an IQ over 200
<Things> hahaha
<DragonFireOKN> You can get it done through a real test that you have to sign up for.
<DragonFireOKN> Those are legit.
<Things> Aint really portable tho :P
<Kjakings> I don't care.
<DragonFireOKN> Don't listen to the crappy ones that you find on google.
<Prince-Dari> But I would have though as different colours of light travel at different speeds, the laser has more kinetic energy, which would transfer to light/heat energy, giving it more power?
<DragonFireOKN> Those are absolute bull.
<Aduro> Aicebo: I've taken an official IQ test, for one, and for another, I also spent two years in the Drama Department
<Things> You can get little red gas llasers, but they require high voltage, so still not safe
<Things> :P
<Kjakings> I want one just to cut through stuff and people'll be like "OMFG MAGIC!"
<Rurik> Clearly it has rub off on you
<Rurik> as you are acting like a drama queen
<spyro_master> cool what plays have you done?
<Kjakings> And the Rurikinja strikes again.
<Things> Prince-Dari, nope, not really
<DragonFireOKN> My IQ is 168.
<Prince-Dari> You cannot have an IQ over 200.
<DragonFireOKN> Yes you can./
<Prince-Dari> In UK 180 is max or something.
<DragonFireOKN> The highest is 228.
<Kjakings> 228? o_O
<Aduro> I don't perform in plays...I spent two years taking drama classes....
<Rurik> Mine is like....130? I just can't get it out
<Prince-Dari> So the extra kinetic energy goes no where?
<DragonFireOKN> Some German dude I think.
<spyro_master> oh gotcha
<Rurik> Like if you were to ask me how to explain something, I couldn't
<DragonFireOKN> The average adult IQ is 100.
<Rurik> but I can liek show you
<Kjakings> Magic
<Things> Alot of the lasers energy gets dissipated into the air
<Prince-Dari> Meh.
<Rurik> Aduro: How can you take Drama classes without acting?
<Things> When it hits dust particles
<Things> :P
<Aduro> I'd perfer not to be a Show-off about my intellect, Thank you.
<Rurik> I think I am onto something...
<Prince-Dari> It still has extra energy. I would have thought that would go somewhere.
<Rurik> and you just proved my point
<Aduro> School
<Aduro> Ever think of that?
<DragonFireOKN> I'm not showing off.
<DragonFireOKN> I'm pointing out facts.
<Kjakings> 23:13	Rurik	and you just proved my point It's fun when people do that without realising.
<DragonFireOKN> If I wanted to show off, you would know it
<Aduro> A School's Drama Department....
<Things> It maybe does, but I don't think its substantial enough to do anything amazing
<Aduro> There's your answer..
<Rurik> Aduro: You are a 13 year old tard who wants people to read his/her fics and makes up stories to make yourself 'awesome'
<Things> Not really any accurate way to measure it
<Prince-Dari> !owner Things
<Prince-Dari> !owner Steve
<Rurik> Ha, you agree with me
<Prince-Dari> !halfop Steve
<Aduro> Nope....I just enjoy writing
<Aduro> it relaxes me
<Rurik> and you want people to read what you write
<Things> ahaha
<Rurik> if you truely enjoy it, you don't care who reads it
<Aicebo> What's school?
<Aduro> That I do, I like to hear feedback on my writing...
<Kjakings> Fuck.

<Aicebo> 13DragonFireOKN: I was forced to play a sport when I was younger and my parents always wanted me to play sports. I am a failure to them and a failure to sports because I think that all (basic/regular) sports suck.
<Prince-Dari> Chasing a huge round cheese down a very steep hill.

<Catabatus> 10Cheesus
<Aduro> 3-.-' hn....
<RedDragonX> 4They should not be dating
<RedDragonX> 4they have no idea on how to control emotions like that
<RedDragonX> 4especially at that age
<RedDragonX> 4it's idiocy
<Aicebo> 13Yeah
<Aicebo> 13I can understand little crushes and stuff, that's natural
<Catabatus> 10Yup
<Aicebo> 13But dating n shit/serious relationships at that age is different
<RedDragonX> 4vastly different
<RedDragonX> 4it's a very dangerous and serious emotion
<Catabatus> 10No relationship can be serious at that age
<RedDragonX> 4you should not even be doing it until you can understand it
<RedDragonX> 4I don't even support it in High school
<Catabatus> 10Which they don't
<Aicebo> 13I would say 14 or 15 should be the youngest
<Catabatus> 10I think of teenagers as kids
<RedDragonX> 4To me I don't trust anyone with the emotion until at least 18
<Catabatus> 10"Child" and "kid" mean different things to me

<Aicebo> 13Spyrorocks: Do you think he should have another chance or ban?
*Catabatus 10waits for the ban hammer to be swung
<Aicebo> 13Personally I think in order for him to quit bitching he should be given one more try, Idk...
<RedDragonX> 4Don't think SR is here right now
<Aicebo> 13Damn.
<RedDragonX> 4wait what did Ayumi Join?
<Aicebo> 13Yes.

<RedDragonX> 4hm
<RedDragonX> 4most likely he will keep him out
<Aicebo> 13Yeah I know
<Aicebo> 13But you never know when someone will change their mind *shrug*
<RedDragonX> 4true
<RedDragonX> 4But he took off awhile ago
<Aicebo> 13Yeah
<RedDragonX> 4don't know when he is coming back
<Aicebo> 13I'm just thinking that maybe it'll stop some of the incidents.
<RedDragonX> 4It might
<Aicebo> 13I'll wait til I hear what he says.

<Prince-Dari> Nick spam :D
<Spyrorocks> all my old friends like twilight.
<Aicebo> 13Ohnoes
<Aicebo> 13Is that all they talked about?
<Spyrorocks> So I spent a good half an hour making fun of it.
<Spyrorocks> Thankfully, no./
<Zephyr-kun> 6lol Twilight sorta sucks xD
<Aicebo> 13XD
<Aicebo> 13I thought the first book was halfway decent
<Aicebo> 13I don't know why it's so popular though
<Aicebo> 13There's lots of books like it but they aren't bashed.
<Zephyr-kun> 6So far I've only read the first one, and I've been told the movie fails xD
<Prince-Dari> I've only seen the movie trailer and it looks fial
<Prince-Dari> fail*
<Zephyr-kun> 6And I really don't see either...
<Spyrorocks> Its bashed because its popular for no reaso
<Spyrorocks> reason
<Prince-Dari> It looks as though some guy is flying out of a window and running through the tops of trees, like in those stupid Chinese fighting movies.
<Aicebo> 13The movie was halfway decent, at least you didn't have to hear Bella describe how "handsome" Edward is through the whole thing.
<Prince-Dari> FLY!
<Aicebo> 13Prince-Dari: LOL
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Zephyr-kun> 6Prince-Dari: SUPAH FLAh!
<Spyrorocks> Aicebo: why did you set your forum status to hidden?
<Aicebo> 13Spyrorocks: I wasn't sure whether or not to ban Ayumi, and if I did I didn't want him to be all pissy if he saw that I was the one who did. Meh. I was going to ask you whether I should or not but you left.
<Aicebo> 13He didn't post.
<Aicebo> 13I just want him to quit bitching
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Oh come on, admit that you want to give him another chance. :P
<Aicebo> I don't.
<Aicebo> I just want him to quit bitching about it
<Aicebo> If he's back there'd be no bitching.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo I'm not going to tell anyone, just admit it. :P
<Aicebo> I don't.
<Aicebo> =/
<Spyrorocks> Ban him
<Aicebo> I thought so before, but all he does is bitch bitch bitch more, more, and more. I just want him to quit harassing everyone
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Fine then, be that way, even Kjakings admitted that he liked C7 when I pressed him, because he knew I was right
<Spyrorocks> Its your duty to keep him banned.
<Aicebo> 13Ok.
<Spyrorocks> banned
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo And I'm not trying to make the point that you like him, I'm using it as an example of when I'm right, you might as well admit it. :P
<Aicebo> I don't "like" him. -___- I have to friend him on sites though so he doesn't bitch to me.
<Aicebo> He USED to be a good friend.
<Aicebo> Til he endlessly went on.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo I told you I wasn't trying to make that point that you 'like' him.
<Aicebo> =/
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Just that you want to give him another chance, and that you should admit it.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Admiiiiiiiiiiiiit
<Aicebo> I only want him to have another chance so he'd quit bitching.
<Aicebo> I'm tired of it.
<Prince-Dari> /notice Aicebo Ok.

<Catabatus> 10Damn reading logs
<Kjakings> 7Surely though, darkness DOES exist? Simply because no light gets there does not mean it is not there, it simply does not reflect any light and therefore cannot be seen by our eyes.
<Prince-Dari> Light reflects off every surface, just some more than others.
<Prince-Dari> And there's still no light there.
<Prince-Dari> Because it is in the shadow of an object.
<Catabatus> 10Shaymin is creepy
<Prince-Dari> It the light does not reach the surface.

<Catabatus> 10Nope
<Catabatus> 10Chat's dead
<Elizabeth> why
<Catabatus> 10What do you mean "why?"
<Catabatus> 10If the chat's dead, it means no one is talking, or hardly talking at all
<Elizabeth> oh
<Aicebo> 13PUTPUT SAVES DA ZOO YO
<Elizabeth> 11like i was saying earlier the is a new TLoSgame called the hour of darkness
<Elizabeth> 11hello??????????????
<Catabatus> 10There IS NO NEW TLOS GAME
<Elizabeth> 11is to
<Catabatus> 10The last TLoS game was DAWN OF THE DRAGON
<Catabatus> 10TLoS is over, Spyro is not
<Elizabeth> 11i saw it on the internet
<Catabatus> 10...
<Catabatus> 10Oh, okay
<Catabatus> 10It's on the internet, so it must be true
<Elizabeth> 11they're going to release it in the fall
<Catabatus> 10Uh huh
<Elizabeth> 11followed by the movie
<Catabatus> 10Yeah, sure
<Catabatus> 10I gotcha
<Elizabeth> 11i'm telling the truth
<Catabatus> 10Right
<Catabatus> 10No, no, I believe you... Really.
<Elizabeth> 11serious?
<Catabatus> 10I mean, just because TLoS is a trilogy and there are three games doesn't mean it's OVER.
<Catabatus> 10Of COURSE they're going to continue TLoS.
<Elizabeth> 11search on google for The Legend of Spyro movie
<Elizabeth> 11it should be there
<Catabatus> 10Alright, I'll play along.
<Aduro> 3they are just going to continue it under a different name
<Elizabeth> 11no they won't
<Aduro> 3-.-'
<Elizabeth> 11:P
<Catabatus> 10Come on, Aduro. They can still continue a TRILOGY when there are already THREE GAMES.
<Catabatus> 10Elizabeth: The Spyro Movie is just a movie version of ANB.
<Aduro> 3A sequel to the trilogy....it won't be called TLoS
<Elizabeth> 11the name of the new movie is Spyro
<Elizabeth> 11by the producers of Eragon
<Catabatus> 10Of course they will continue TLoS, silly! It doesn't matter if TLoS is *CONFIRMED TO BE OVER*
<Aduro> 3-.-'
<Catabatus> 10 13:47	Elizabeth	 by the producers of Eragon That's the only thing you've said that's made sense.
<Elizabeth> 11in the darkest hour Spyro has to face the dark master
<Catabatus> 10They are turning ANB into a movie. It doesn't mean they're continuing TLoS
<Catabatus> 10Spyro already confronted and defeated Malefor
<Catabatus> 10"The Darkest Hour" was what Dawn of the Dragon was originally going to be called.
<Elizabeth> 11i said the dark master i didn't say anything about malefore
<Catabatus> 10They are NOT making another Spyro game called "The Legend of Spyro"
<Catabatus> 10MALEFOR IS THE DARK MASTER
<Elizabeth> 11will to
<Elizabeth> 11is not
<Aduro> 3MALEFOR IS THE DARK MASTER!!!!
<Elizabeth> 11the dark master was the first purple dragon
<Elizabeth> 11not Malefore
<Catabatus> 10Malefor was the first purple dragon. Malefor is the Dark Master
<Aduro> 3Whom is Malefor
<Catabatus> 10THEY ARE THE SAME DRAGON
<Elizabeth> 11are not
<Catabatus> 10CHRIS WILSON *SAID* THEY ARE THE SAME DRAGON
