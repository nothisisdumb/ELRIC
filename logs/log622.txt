we're playing the role of two people having a decent conversation
/me puts on a fez
Priceless
/me Listens to some Beach Boys
/me puts on music and starts singing along... ".. kissed a mare and I liked it..."
i have there music on my phone
/me has an overpriced record player
Whos a silly pony
*you're
dont correct me
I shall
/me listens to Eminem
To the correcting of course
I would've said the eminem
eminem is bucking awesome
the screen
it wa funnier
was*
I wont back down!
...
/me really dislikes poorly made covers of songs
that he lieks
*likes
The Osama Bin Ladden Dis from eminem :D
i know
stream over?
yeah it's over
I remember bawling the first time I heard "When I'm Gone"
Just Lose It was a good song
Refreshed :)
refreshy REFRESHY DWARF!
Plus i still need my visa and passport
Fuck the Locust we nuke Jacinto ourselves to show we ain't afraid of no Lucusts.
:D http://swellco2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rarity-eminem.jpg
I need to catch them with a net and put them in this jar.
dunno yet
Probably Star Trek like he usually does.
never
all righty then
or its an incomplete product
well, its just a port
's been decent
STREAM
damn it
nothing
refresh
ohh tf2
are you too old for this shit?
and it crashes
CMC are best soldiers: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ukh09t2w1r9ntj6o1_500.png
I see tf 2
and buffer again
cool

yes
that's like 4 evers of load time.
Hello Everyponyyyy
swedish
dis music
well ok I'm out.
I played skyrim for 80 hours without being halfway, didn't like the main story
there are side quests
>.>
cool
Main story was meh.....
those kinds of games arent meatn for the main story man
>.>
bah, whatever
But the side quests are AWESOME
however
ok
the main story is not the point
Ping! *shakes fist*
The length of main quest can't really be said. The length of F1 mainquest can be done in 3-4 hours, F2 same if you're really good. Same with most old TESgames I figure
oh, I like this
it usually doesnt
ok see you all I'm tearing up from all the yawning I'm doing.
Saying that you are not supposed to play the story is fucking stupid
first join first served
MvM
password is wrekisbestpony
its like reading lord of the rings and someone says "you are not supposed to read the book. you are supposed to read fanfiction only"
cowvarkian,in certain games yeah,
first join first served
what's the server address?
by
can i join?
not the main quest
bye
*facepalm*
neyayea
Does EVERYBODY in the world have a TF2 server?
no guilds?
no daedric quests?
oh look. Stream, huh
i cant find it
greetings everyone
except wander and kill shit
I heard that Syrims Main Quest ends rather underwhelming
whats TES?
The elder scrolls,
does anyone else hear ping noises
oh cant join its full :(
HERE IS SKYRIMS STORY IN NUTSHELL "you are the chosen one now go kill this dragon"
The*
bullshit
^
as well
pingpingpongping
what's all this bitching about fallouts?
in morrowind i feel like i actually get shit done and feel accomplished, in skyrim everything is just handed to you
and--the interaction in main story is great
it also helps thatn there is a lot less post apocalypse on the gaming market than fanatasy
I like the actual backstory of elder scrolls
Dem headshots.
JARATE AWAY!
mhmm
specially lonesome road
Living is suffering.
Image links are okay during stream, right? (I just got done re-reading the rules)
Then come on over and look at this: http://fav.me/d5cfmas
Woot Woot MvM!!! Afternoon eveyone! :)
Pringles are good :3
most of NV's bugs were sorted ratehr rapid
Damn snipers are badas
bugs here and there are to be expected
skyrim is way buggier than NV to me
Dat ED face
Dat Ed
SEEM LEGIT
speaking of ed faces http://derpiboo.ru/82664?scope=scpe9d7820e52af9d62b465ad3aea22338185bc5c415
but i did liek FO3's settign a bit more than NV's
Whose this band?
this is beautiful
^
they've had this countdown going down for some time now
people thought it was for a the world ends with you sequel
I diddnt think Fo3 had much roleplay or replayability to be honest.
turns out it's just some andriod port of the world ends with you
not a sequel
And that makes me mad >:(
Jarating a machine? Whats that gonna do? :D
^
time to upgrade my piss in a bottle....
Mm, yes, but I felt the western was a bit justified by the locatoin and how--fake las vegas is, but I dunno, I kinda agree
Someone ping me?
thogh, contentwise NV was an upgrade
with then loadingbench and ALL THOSE GUNS!
Agreed yeah
Also, ping did not work.. how do I enable that on HydraIRC?
yes
i aint said shit son
good night guys
*listen to
Aw, I wanna play MvM :(
HAY GUYZ@!!!!@!#!#
i ain't said shit about skyrim
MvM?
Dat sniper :o
Dat sniper again o_o
lol
though i did hate how NV did with the BoS
after FO3 they were kidna the good guys
after NV
i feel like sidign with the enclave 24/7
In F1 they're half evil, they don't give a shit about you, and I like that
but casuals have the money
and money talks
you're just an elitist
damn stairs http://derpiboo.ru/83454
<3
inb4 bomb blows up
isn't Twilight able to teleport?
This is getting me in the mood to play some TF2
the clean cut modern and mature gamer has time for other things
The Brotherhood in FNV is how the Brotherhood should be.
DAT CALLADOODIE
Brotherhood only stand for tech, never helping, or even attacking civilians, but the BOS in Fo3 is an offshoot group that refuse to neglect helping hte civilians
and how it was in FO2 and before
Someone ping me again?
BoS aren't bastards they are just detached as fuck
EVIIIÑ
DAMMIT
Depends on the chapter
only Vault I knwo fo being cracked for tech was via enclave
which is..weird
BoS have hit abandoned vaults
Was it one still active?
but BoS- haven't they attacked civilians in F1?
http://cheezburger.com/6536387072
Vault 69 had 999 women and 1 man
@Wrek- <3<3<3
hello everypony :)
dem crits
over 900 each hit
Hehe, I did- but I was playing a role-
also, ping still won't ping me
is that korpiklaani? ?
I think Enclave attacked Vault 13?
thought*
dat swing speed
seperate, first time running it
Inded
*Indeed
throw more jarate
Dat wrecking
You might need to explore settings
Fe is like a blend, KKat has played all the games
missed 1 bundle :(
theres a tiny bit of Wasteland references too
/me tries
Should I eh.. try to enable CTCP ping or..like a script?
brb
I need to replay wasteland.
Yeah, FoE becomes its own thing, really nice story and different enough to be exciting
Any HydraIrc users here?
why does everyone wanna play TF2 when i'm on my crappy-ass laptop? :<
Damn-
well, I'm gone , good night everyone!
Someone ping me?
/me nags
and then there was silence
drowning
thats hte sound of forgiveness and drowning
...
Is the stream working for anyone?
you might have to refresh
:(
Dem posters :D
*Hey
OOOhhh, nice.
ooo
are ping noise on
hey everypony iam back
wb
Welcone back.
probaly
ow.
:D

Back. Just had to restart my computer.
>_><_<>_><_< http://derpiboo.ru/83087
welcome back
Allo everypony.
lol, i just found wreks server, now i wait
:D
O_o
Dat moving to the beat :D
Looks like it, lol
Sniper induced motion sickness.
Because F3- even if I loved it, it kinda feels like fanfiction
Engie! Y u no press F4!?
whos pinging!?
Obsidian*
Well, not everything, for me. Mothership Zeta is a joke.
Yes
...
I like the end of mothership zeta, We get to be all star trek
motehrship zeta was a fun DLC
I've never played it, actually, but it just can't be canon
Full power to the forward sheilds!
Still, doesnt make it a good DLC. FO3s good DLCs are The Pitt and Point Lookout.
yeah, it's like those jokes in F2
Point look out was stupid
HOW DID THIS CONVERSATION START?!
It just doesn't interest me.
It's all very much grey surrounded by suoer mutants.
super*
/me dances to the music
:o
I really enjoyed Fo3, but I did close my eyes to some things, and some things--just bugged me with the canon
This song! :o
3Dog just felt a bit too modern-
hai everypony, how you doing? :)
It just bugs me
Ded.
hai Micheal
Niece is asleep early and house is clean. Wat do.
Well, shit. I'm just gonna go get food. See you all later.
it makes places like The Glow uninteresting- the glow was amazing because of the weird loot
Hehe, and a CRUTCH in the mailbox as well
thoguh iirc, i liekd how repair worked beter in FO3
Whos streaming?
But it was expensive in FONV, plus high level guns are rare.
yes
ping
in FNV?
yes
I think I did it--without it?
^ U guys talking about FoNV?
yeah, among other fallouts
yes
nah in NV jury rigging is only to help you make special ammo
basically
atleast when it comes to NV
I've played hardcore mode
It's still not hard
its to make ir slightly more realistic and gettign you to actualyl drink and eat and sleep
nothing else
I've played in hard
I play in Normal with Hardcore, and I think it's just the right amount of hard for my playstyle
on hardcore mode, there, more description
in hrd
hard*
i loved hardcore, for realism
but yeah-
everytiem i got back to FO3 i say "but wheres hardcore?"
0,5Ill give you a hard core~
Yeah, but you could die like weeks later in F1 and 2, if you weren't attentive
Maybe you were lurking or I wasn't paying attention.
stupid crAPPLE... I want my desktop already, this damn thing's wireless card always fails on me and when it does, it freezes the system.
/me facefloors
brb
back
Ugh, I should be cleaning house, but i don't feel like it
also
VATS is for pussies
they were made before the war
well I guess I'll play some TF2 multiplayer because I can't host apparantly and because I can't find more people to play MvM with
around 2070's
yeah
in The Glow and Mariposa
I'm out of Mann up mode Tickets
I should go trade for some
Hehehe
all the jarate
creepy?
How long did u take to walk down those stairs?
:)
haven't taken note on time
but less than an hour for sure
I took me 5 min:$
I think F1 had some texas
*It
Where did it cut off?
Well the fact that texas is way to south
Bye bye!
Where most of the storires have taken place around california, except for 3
dat "tank"
and I really hope they hit the story right, and atmosphere
all the sprays
Some of the robots bugged me a lot
Rex, botson is already ruined
I was talking about the selfaware humanoid ones i that Rivet city quest, just terrible.
Oh those enclave androids? Yeah I hope they drop that
Commonwealth androids
yeah, that's the name
/me tries to do mental map
Boston-New England (the north east). Chicago- the midwest
/me yawns
now I'm worried
More like the commonwealth is Fallouts equivelent of MIT
amd MIT is where?
my comptuer is bucking up. brb gonna do a restart
exactly
I forget
massachusets
/me spellpowers , GO
Well, if they make it work, I'll enjoy it
same place
and no it isn't
People like him should have gotten a lot of attention :/
no
They have made one

some stupid fucker botched up a restoration of an old picture in a church or something
Spademagnes[R]:Probably all of them.
Ooh, hehehe
YES
I GOT PSO2 WORKING!
I need to find a musical note pin for my Uncle's funeral - other than jewelery stores, where can I specifically find that pin?
why are we watching tf2?
Hello everpony
http://www.acountrypriest.com/2012/08/25/ Not sure if source :/
I need it by Wednesday night - funeral is thursday
Also, there is a Tornado running through my area atm
well a Tornado warning anyway
i see demomen all the time in mvm
they can help drastically
Long time no see
Hi

good break?
Bye Guys

http://derpy.me/YPeP5
:3
Look at that health bar go
Beats me, i only use denoman or soldier in MvM
hmm, links borked
This song <3
oh no
JINGLE JANGLE
JIngle jangle
dat music, ideal for kill
I think I heard this song on the radio the other day.
Paintchat only works to some people, and noone really knows why- it seems?
/me is downloading Java
Hello everypony!
I'm able to get in via Phase's link- but yeah

That Ed face
Dat Fluttershy :3
all dat money
all that loss
Does money carry over in MvM?
yes
but only if you get it
.
Use IE? HAH
but wave to wave
Out of curiosity
As in, physically?
and that
is why
you play as sniper
on MvM
Not sure
...
I don't know, but they've mailed me and I've been using it for years.
900 dmg each
They've mailed you?
Pardon me there's a word missing there.
never*
Why is my TF2 failing to launch :(
Can't really have "Use and IE" in the same sentence... unless it's "IE is of no use" :3
Because hl2.exe is notorioously bad about that.
That or it's updating.
The fact my school computer has IE on it as its main browser angers me
Just took awhile O_o
That, too :P
Preparing to launch.
Still preparing to launch.
FULL POWER!
^
Aha.
SOMEONE GET THE MOOLAH!
Same
yeah
oh, Ranger
Has yours crashed yet?
Oh yeah, I'm working on getting a copy of GW2.
NO ONE PICKED UP THE MOOLAH!
has a couple of times
Well...not really
Stop wasting ammo
They're both equal, IMO.
As in, hardcore addiction.
oh wait he is
Now he plays LoL.
http://i.imgur.com/gkKjs.png
I played WoW for 5 years.
Oh man, i cant play LoL
Cba to continue with Mists.
Jonhy guitar
dat recharge
As it stands my Nord Warrior in GW2 is already fairly interesting, if a bit flimsy.
hay everypony, i'm back
warrior =/= tank
:P
Nothing particularly seems to = tank at the moment.
I think
I have a shield damnit.
I think-
/me has no idea
For example, the rather frightening lack of healers.
Yeah, it doesn't have any particular archetype.
O_O
Oh my
This song again :D
Wait, never mind
Fuck you Java. Fuck you.
Oughta join up
Does it have a decent story at least?
That was my other problem with MMOs.
Vivix:I got in yaaaay
Story is apparently different based on some multi choice questions in character creation.
Liberai futera
WHY
O.o
yep
Well, personal story anyway.
That pic!
Whats the main purpose of GW?
I always have issues finding the motivation in an MMO.
one sec, this'll take a minute
Especially when all the quests start becoming "Go here, kill this many of this mob, collect this many of this drop"
/me hums along
No fluid integration of story and mechanics.
Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec
She passed out. Too much punch.
ha yah Famicon
The "Party Rock" theme ponified.
that was horrible
i like the orginial song
Next round!
I see Meanwhile's of the power gamer variety.
Gnight everypony HF :)
well that was fun ^_^
aww man i wanted to play with ya
Oh hi twilight
I am a washing machine pony
thx
In GW2, ancient elder dragons have just awakened, causing massive issues, and it's about the 5 races having to come together to stop them before they accomplish whatever it is they're trying to do
And hello newvegas
Oooh, NV
*ROck*
*Rock*
Stupid shift key.
pingpongpingityping
ELDER DRAGONS OF WRATH
I've just been stacking power because it best translates to "Hit things harder"
just hover over them
/me loads up rhe X68000 version of Akamajou Dracula (Castlevania)
The more you know.
hmm... time to go play sum metroid prime :)
BYE THAT CARD
Hm
BUY THAT CARD
ohh this place is alive
Aw :(
Straight warriors or mages tend to get somewhat boring after a while.
...The hell's with her hat?
Is her hat..clipping?
probably
haven't delved too much into stats yet, still only L16
For example, I'd like to do something more amusing than "dump into Strength, hit things repeatedly until they die"
i forgot that word existed
lol
/me turns on his Pipboy
*nods*
Oh yeah?
I do!
Oooh, very fitting x3
gw2 talk ?
yep
you start every vid with that awesome song
I always buy cards from merchants.... even though I'm TERRIBLE at Caravan
i'll sit down a pretend i know something about it :3
One of my other, many issues with MMOs.
and*
/me glomps derpy
Gameplay can get boring.
i just kill people and take their money
Hi everypony I'm back
I steal everything that isnt nailed down
Even the nails
why am i being glomped? ; ~;
i dont hunny
/me goes to play some Akamajou Dracula in full screen
ill be AFPC
Actually that would prolly be more Squeenix
i remember when this song first came out 1941 <3
Damn thats old
yes
WvW?
yeah
/me waiting
most of the time when mmo's get boring, it's because you have to grind to level up
Note to self: http://fav.me/d5ch6e4
Nothing like the sound of gunfire in the soundtrack of a 60s metropolis area
Didnt Cass die last time he played this?
yes she did
I'm trying to find out if using melee weapons on spellcaster classes actually translate to melee abilities, but the wiki is (Still) down and everywhere else is rather lacking.
inb4 buttaze
SHMAWZOW!
POP right in the mouth!
/me looks at Derpy
HNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Awww
DAYUUMM!
brb gonna grab me some HeadPhones
bad thing is that all of the US servers were already showing high/full, with only 1 at medium capacity
*GASP*
/me has been revived at half health
Anyone got a health potion?
WAIT NO!
HA!
/me stops the rp by breaking the 4th wall
/me fixes the 4th wall with a band-aid
/me looks at the fourth wall, in pieces and walks away...
WOAH That's a lot of RP
Twiden and Flutterscorp? Oh my :O
/me fixes 4th wall, reinforces fifth
enjoyed*
I think that was BF3?
and to join the NCR just to SPITE THEM
not sure
Yeah
COD4 is arguably the best
cause I think that nuke was really unexpected
Oh yeah
?
KILL VUPLES
who's streaming? o 3o
as much as I hated the franchise even back then
also hai gaiz :3
BOOM HEADSHOT
I tried marrying hte ink spots music...
I can admit it was good for its time
and it did set the WWII theme in the mainstream
Such an improvement
and made other companies grab a bite in the crowd
CoD is addicting though, plus its fun to hear people whine online
CoD was great back then but now it's a pile of cashcow
besides skyrim
Why's that?
It's too complicated and I don't have the time to make it work properly.
It seems I've been ignored
Helpful.
Yay~
I could agree on that
Bo2 is trying to make the series look less bad, they actually are changing some things
^
Kids :P
Magic
12 year olds is why
Its for all consoles
I COULD KILL EVERYTHING?!
I tried it once... never got into it
MW2?
weather is getting really bad here
I think... 4... I forget
I might go offline because of this nasty weather all
brb looking outside
sit in trenches all day long
I'm back everypony.
Shoot, reload, shoot, reload
get sick
Draw an epic drawing of the TARDIS.
Hi HenHur

dig trench
I'll be back later; gonna take a nap -_-
dig trench
DIE OF DYSENTERY
I'm going to keep the radio station's live stream open for a while to see if they are playing loyalty
If CoD does the same shit all the time, why the fuck does it keep selling?
Well ok then.
12 year olds
Hey at least fighting games are interesting
CoD has no variations at all in its formula
Well the future seems to be in right now
Kirby
I sort of find halo interesting
Though Dishonored is coming out soon
Kirby is TERRIFYING
I get into it alot more than CoD ever did for me
maybe...
FPS*
Steampunk fuck yeah
I like Steampunk :3
steampunk is interesting
TF2 is fun :3
goan download something
and play
gimmie a moment please
problem?
Why is FF6 3 in japan?
I hate steampunk.
you do??? -_-
what's not to like about Steampunk
/me brings out the airguitar to the awesome song.
/me rocks out with her air lute
Otherway around, I think
STEAMPUNK IS AWESOME!
Steampunk is too steamy.
oh
hahahahahahahahaha
steamboy was a good movie

FUK YOSELF
You ponies ever see Linkaras review for the Doom comic book? Its epic.

Quake was made after Doom
Quake is meh

Doom was great-

YES

Well, it still is fun, but was as in past
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS?!
Tell me about it.
COMPARING DOOM TO MW3 Is like comparing a steak to a piece of shit
more like comparing two unrelated franchises with different goals

Let's face it, the BFG9000. Must I say, BEST WEAPON EVER?!

Isnt it Ironic that something called "Final phantasy" has more than 1 installment?
o_o
I shall!!
I haven't played it either
/me runs off to find some downloads

/me doesnt really see the problem with not playing FF :/
I don't call myself a gamer, despite my gaming history
^
twilgiht_sprinkle THANK YOU.
FF6 is probably one of the best JRPG's out there
cool song here
I don't mind people saying "I like calling myself a gamer" but I don't like it when they start telling others "I am a real gamer, you are not"
Blammo, the Shoot Gun!
goddammit now I have the urge to play Doom again
brutal doom, takes doom and triples the blood and gore
Brutal Doom? I must aquire this then
Cloppers aren't a problem unless they force anything
and we don't
RULE 34 is why we can't have nice things
It is
Rule 34 is made for nice things
o_o
R34 is a simple fantasy
rule 34 ruined many things
R34 is a nice thing....
(\
http://derpy.me/0564C
Yes they are
Some
they can be
Like limbo
^
Limbo was epic
since VideoGames are things that needs to be created
from an imaginative mind
ALL THE BLOOD!!
but
oh
if you can create worlds in games, hows it different from painting or architecture, those are considered arts
lol
Brb downloading lol
^^^^

Hehehe
gatling guns <3
or minguns
whatever
EQAD?
adult version of EQD
run by other people
actually run by a nonclopper- for some reason
theres a adult version? is it just a r34 site?
I heard that 1 of the guys is on both EQD and EQAD
yeah, pretty much, fanfic and pictures
man those pinkies (pie) sure are cool
And animations
Oh yeah
Anything of interest to cloppers
modded doom

Mod is like an extra gamemode for something
theres an r34 EQD? lol
nNICE

I thought the FAQ said he only had archive interest
not for the faint of heart
I totally support anything that isn't harmful
Very scary.
pony pr0n = softcore
well. Not actively support
actually nvm, not surprised
pony porn is pretty softcore, most of it
if theres ever an outbreak of monsters i know which weapon to acquire
i saw one hardcore pony r34 <.< cannot unsee

straw8
How did they come up with all that?

The problem is, you have to clear those thousand.
It's like...a gradual upslope.

If it was at a state fair, and judging that some of the hits didn't go through, I would guess that it was probably just a BB gun
Figure that means Meloeta and Genesect are coming to the US soon. No specific dates yet.
Or Pellet
13ja was a machine gun type BB gun

I can't claim to know much about fashion but never did I think I'd hear that squidhats were in.
13no one at the fair understood me offering buds for them either :<
I'm not saying he's an alien...
But he's an alien
Trade you a Shako for it.
13most of the hat stands had a sign out saying "please do not take photos with the hats"
13and i'm thinking why not, if you buy it you're going to take one picture and never wear it again anyway
sooooooooooooooo boooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
And if you do it without buying it they might as well be a hat rental service.

Try -20C and see how cold really is.
ive gone shirtless in 5F
13which is
13-28C
anyone heard of that TWEWY iOS port?
MR.T
13it was well below 0F for most of january

At least Celsius makes sense, I mean, they found something and made a measurement.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLVuM140HbI
13you don't need decimal points for it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_0n5gp1fE&feature=bf_next&list=FLPN5DjWyWmPMRIRo4tnD6gw
13a single degree fahrenheit is more granular than a single degree celsius
Oh hey, another stoner Saxy

Personally I'm content to say "It's cold" or "It's warm" or "My face is melting" for temperature related issues.
0,14I'm not that stoner looking ;_________;
hey grew a hair
dude wheres my jacket

And if you can't work in decimals you're slow.
lel
Also yes Saxy you look stoned.
0,14LIES
13only place we use decimals in fahrenheit tends to be when checking fever temperature
I'd have linked it already but the site is slow.
13cause that extra 0.1 degree fahrenheit is the difference between getting out of school and going while feeling ill

Kaldeo is out, to Gamestop tommorow

I don't live anywhere near a Gamestop
Sigh

http://i.imgur.com/dSv0s.png I should update that. Since I have more hair now and my beard is thinner.
We still have to wait for Gamestop to open today though.
Especially among the artists. Very few of them actually do suspicious materials. Which is actually scarier, because it means they're naturally fucked in the head.
I'm never gonna get Keldeo....
I have to go to sleep now.
And yet, at the same time, a lot of stoners actually seem like regular folks.
haha , that was my initial reaction :D
oh
I should be going to sleep too :3
well boo hoo
youve never seen his Glorious stache?
:P
I'm not going too XD
And no one is ever gonna trade me one...
Fuuuck
I should be, but i'm not gonna.
I've seen the stache, but it amazes me every time.

Bye everypony I got AP Enlgish homework that is due in 4 hours
I hardly go to gamestop as it is!
Why am I seeing whitw spots all over the pkace
I have a habit of immediately disposing of any picture that get taken of myself.
It couples well with my habit of avoiding pics at any opportunity.
then goes O_O
Dunno, I haven't browsed that in years.
Dang it why did Deoxys not win?
for merch
How to get keldeo?
All I know is, pictures of myself are not good.
I'm having a hard time evern seeing my hands o_o
How did Dwoxys not win?

I have a Jirachi
We have NEVER gotten him

I have two darkarai
And the moustache quirk.
Darkrai would be nice too
Actually I've not been able to stop doing that for just about every face I pull for a decade.
...not any good ones on my computer
I had a celebi, then my friend restarted my soulslver
Darkrai was available for wifi

It's the best for teaching the concept of code flow, though. Moving from one statement to another, etc.

"Synergy" is a word I stay away from unless I need it to describe something specific.
fpor the curious
*for
heheh, dat name
Or if I'm trying to sound like corpspeak.
lol
IT TWINKLED.
And then Blizzard seen this episode and said. "Screw it, we're putting it back in the game."
and they do
"Synergize" is just one of those words.
XD
It's good in sci-fi, though.
nvm

reminds me of goddamn one boss fight from FFXII
Same that I'm not like them.
I lost 13 kilogram in the last 13 weeks. Man, feels good to not be overweigh anymore
They did nothing but grind on low level monsters. They shouldn't have anything that doesn't drop from them.
Hotpocket. 1.Unwrap, 2. Microwave, 3.Immediatly drop in toilet
Why dose Giving some kids a Dev weapon seem like a REALLY bad idea?
Either too hot or too cold
There's one in every crowd.
goddamn 17 hours?
Another horrible indicator of the corpspeak mentality: flowcharts.
13tended to just have him fill out paragraphs and i did the rest of the work building a style guide and making the project not look like everyone else's, which was barely high school grade work in a college course
Why not just make uber armor and weapon to kill the ultimate player with?
oh my gawd..
Did you have a flowchart?

APPLE BLOOM y u no talk to Granny smith about this!
Seriously how fucking old is she?
lol
11,01She can talk perfectly well with a piece of paper in her mouth. Neat!
I can see why people don't like the Mare Do Well episode considering that her friends don't tell her how they feel, but she also wouldn't have learned a lesson of the corrupting power of fame, either.
actually young GS is really cute
NO I DO NOT
*Some
Granny is a Highlander
PS: Look at the tent!
It bothers me that they gave them a land near a hellgate
11,02I'm giving the benefit of the doubt of her parents naming her 'GRANNY SMITH' :)
she jealous
they ARE the apple family
close enough
11,02But honestly, Granny Smith was a good looking mare back in the day.
no
And then she disapered with the zomponys, the end!
she's Granny Smith Apple
Applejack Apple
I really don't like it when characters are named according to their role in the series as of present time without any regard for continuity.
Get a torch
no worries
00,02o_O
11,02Everypony, listen up!
they dont have last names, just cause they're called the apple family doesnt mean thats their last name
00,02: D
00,02JESmith71, ikr
Granny's are for Pwning noobs!
They should be freaking rich by now
Ponies dont have last names. at least, not family names.
and thus walmart was born
150 years

00,02it keeps blinking the taskbar anyway
00,02very noisy program

I always had to use IDCLIP and shoot the head on a spike to finish it.
Which if I remember right was the developer's head.
idspispopd was the noclip code in doom 1 if i remember right
doom1 used to scare the crap outta me when i was a kid
heh
Is this mode just waves of Imps, Barons, and Cacodemons?
Oh and regular Demona

Mmm milk

I need to go to school before 7:00 am.
Ugh.
Goodnight hopefully
Are these monsters seriously killing someone in a weapons room...?
Stupid AI.

SUDDENDLY
Doom II had awesome music. :3
I like the one that was made to this track.
I've always wanted to hear this song played with actual instruments.
Like the "electric guitar" that's playing here
Doom 2's graphics engine isn't actually 3d. It's a two dimensional map with two-dimensional graphics. The raised structures and such give the illusion of 3d.
but isn't the map 3D?
05basically advanced raytracing
I heard they aren't in 3D either.
I don't know about RE. I just know about Doom. =P
Yup
Flat 2-dimensional sprites
TRAP'D
I heard they got sued for that.
Id had little patience for Apogee, after screwing with them like they did
Yep!
not in the Doom movie. 6_9
Yay~
The movie sucked balls. Only part of it that was good was when the hero got that powerup and we got that whole scene from his POV.
Especially when he picked up the chainsaw. Huge nostalgiagasm there.
Because FPS don't always satisfy my needs.
I think it's fun, but it lacks plot.
heh
00,10multy player?
heh
I perfer the N64 version over the XBLA version though.
I don't have any useful input. =P
Hi MAS
Aww yeah, Slayer-bases track!
Never played it
Lol. It is Doom.
Doom 2 to be exact
The only I playeddd was the very first. Kinda explains why I didn't know this was Doom XD
.
One man...Duke Nukem.
Holla everypony! :)

Again.

Hi guys!

Listen to this jingle jangle of my gypsy tamberine.
