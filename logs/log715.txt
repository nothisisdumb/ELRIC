Unfortunately for all of you.
Only the Avatar, master of the bow and arrow, could stop them.

hey GUYS
did you KNOW
gtg, see y'all later!
I'll be back . . .
Really, though, the Marvel movies really make me have mixed feelings about this.
Hey
but como on... Its Star Wars
It finished perfectly
they havent ruined them
Hm
I like it.
/me sits down and meditates
does no one realize that starwars has been completly crap for years?
alright nitt, sleep well mate
11,01I apologize for this. We'll play on stream another day.
floof
night, nitt. dream of ponies tonight :)
i personally didnt mind the prequels tbh
they havent done that with magic
its business
get use to it
magic is EXTREMELY well managed
0,5MAHGICKS
well, even if they do. we still have our fandom at least :)
night night everypony
wizards of the coast does a majority of it
And yet the sad truth is that it's the 5th reincarnation of a kids show that was only made to promote kids toys
As awesome as it is
Well I gotta cut on processes while running L4D apparantly
See you all later tonight
they make it because players demand it
thats because the target audience was children, and maybe us
those are ex[ensive
and they eat a lot
speaking of magic
11,01Don't know, but I'm selling it.
I am back!
yikes
I'M GOING A PRO TOUR QUALIFIER THIS WEEKEND!
Hello?
I am back :3
And nothing of value was gained.
It was an awesome toy line made tv show made franchise made Hit Movie Trilogy
Well this is odd
I wasn't kicked

It's successful because people like it, and people want it
how about them 100 plushies I gave you?
Wait, I mean PRODUCED it.
not a reboot
Hm
/me could not give any less of a shit about star trek
Not much going on here.
and they are all mine. MINE! ALL MINE
i mean star wars
All right.
i cant believe lucas approved this
Yes, Lucas had a sequel trilogy planned, but he abandoned it
13i thought everyone knew it was intended to be 9 films
/me breaks yet another window and hops out
because he FELT THE TRILOGY ENDED THE STORY PERFECTLY.
Well that's 4.05 billion dollars thrown around.
I believe that was sarcasm
Clearly this was always the plan.
dammit I look away for 1 mintue and I lose the converstation
Make part 4 5 and 6.
Let them make the rest of it.
inb4 musical numbers
Also, MAGIC.
I can see it now, EWOKS singing with a princesss
Pirates didn't have musical numbers.
With Lucas out of the picture maybe Star Wars could be good? I dunno.

I shoveled a driveway that contains a large, uneven crack at every metre AND it sits on a hill!
13all the guys i know call me crazy when i tell them they could wear tights and extend shorts season by a good three weeks
I did it THREE TIMES since the first snowfall, and last time took me 2 hours.
13nuh uh
13guys are just afraid of being pretty
Also, one does not know cold until they walk in -25 celcius weather fr a week.

I don't know if it's considered spoilers, but is mentioning that a certain character reappers during the first few minutes count as one?

ya don't say
totally something Fluttershy would do
The version of Frankenstein I read had him grow the monster in a tube
13Lunar_Brony: well actually
cheap he says
cheap for u
13check $4.10/gal in $/L
unless I did my conversions wrong . . .
again
13california's up that high i think
foreign gas is always cheaper due to different wage standards
I hate the goddamn combat in these guns
11,02It's about $4.39 here
^
13ouch much higher
13yep
we get USA gas and the price goes up because we have to pay minimum wage, etc.
13up here the nonregulars have been above $4 since... probably 08
11,02Hey, at least it doesn't cost the same as ink, which is like $2,000 a gallon
sucks for anyone that needs premium
only $1.15 per litre in California
Made in America, but the cost is a bit higher
13i think the stations have all been reluctant to break $4 for regular
you have cheap gas
you DIED
11,02o3o
the average here is 3.535
$4 in July 2008
in dollars
It is getting rather gassy in here, isn't it? :P
Winter gas is cheaper
Now that I think about it, everything in the US is cheaper. Most of our prices are monitered by the governemt, except gas.
