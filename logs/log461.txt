Am I the only one who wouldn't want a cutie mark?
Dken2021: broadband.

ImOkayWithThis: :P
TheRainbowDash: Today was a good day for me, thanks for asking.
good RainBowJack
Mish: D'awww...*smiling at you*
:)
Memme: you'd prefer to not know your value in this world?
Wait...2 ImOkayWithThis...SPY!
Even if I'm the Flutterpie
$65 I meant
Scavender: Oh, awesome to hear that. I am having a super duper amazing day today.
whatever
mr oizo...you are forcing the volume to stupid levels
hey Scavender hows your day been
Kandarihu: Yes. It gives me more freedom.
Irish_Pony: Orly Where?
(can be really whacky when around happy ethusatic people, shy around most strangers, hides in conors ect.)
hello alexxm, my day was good, thanks for asking
Kandarihu: I would want to discover it.
Mish: so, normal for Bronystate.
Memme: what good is freedom without purpose or direction?
Yeah :)
Mish: I know *exactly* what you mean. :D
?
This.
Oh god, this song....:D
what the.... gala....whut
OMG
Kandarihu: Does freedom have something to do with direction?
Kandarihu: Isn't it the opposite?
Dupstep dance innsues!
also, I keep thinking Misha, I've been playing a certain VN too much.
(wubwubwub) Dubstep time.
VN? which one?
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash: what is the name of the song?
alexxm: *cuddles with you, purring softly*
TheRainbowDash: what you listening to atm?
My full name is Miss_Cuddles
I love the random roleplay here.
ImOkayWithThis: I actually don't know, but I just know that this is amazing.
Im a cat
I always seem to mistake dubstep with beatbox.
*who*
d3rb-tipsy: The music on the stream, and wub Dubstep.

oh ok...lol mines on mute
Oh so mystical....
I am back from making 2 IRL pony pics

Link, por favor.
FlareChaser: Please......
Dken, i hate mine two
FlareChaser: Links?
FlareChaser: Digital or traditional?
Twi_Fi: I could make 5, but I dont want too :P
meh, i prefer what i had on. more BPM
To discover for yourself how you can influence the world for the better, whether it be in a big way or a small way. Not to be merely told what to do by a government that doesn't care about you. That is freedom.
Om: Lol I dunno
still ok though
i think i will be making some lyrabon IRL pics
Kandarihu: That's why I wouldn't want a cutie mark.
whats your Ponyname and oc
FlareChaser: >/)>
FlareChaser could you send me a link next friday to
And then fighting without the music...:D
But to drift your way through life being useless in times of great need. That is a perversion of freedom.
discord
Do it
AT THE GRAND GLLOPING GALA IS THE BEST PLACE FOR ME
Kandarihu: You lost me somewhere.
alexxm: what?
?

Hello SuperBrony64
What?:D
ah.
11,02I just woke up ^_^
They stand side by side, and a feeling of fear goes through both Amythest and her brother, Spaheire. "What we have here is not an end to war, He said to her, "but an end to our fight...no winner inculded". With that, the beast; a sort of alteinate draconqis, begins her rampage after her last true friend died...
FlareChaser: Also, camera quality?
and now we have fanfic walls.
11,02<TheRainbowDash> d3rb-tipsy: Nintendo 64, all the way.
alexxm, Om: He had some medical problems that meant he couldn't do any more music. I don't believe he ever elaborated as to what they were though.
Yay!
Memme: Eh, I'm working on getting a new camrea
64=8^2=(-8)^2
FlareChaser: Nice!
Okay. There should be a general rule. If you're going to post links from 4chan, make sure to strip out the src/
Ok im going to stop that....I have problems with overflow of creativity
SuperBrony64: that would be me talking about pokemon stadium prior to that...
SuperBrony64: That is my favorite console system of all time.:)

ingwaz: Luna trapped on the moon.
Om: I'll admit, I don't listen to Brony music much, but his is the lot that made me really realise how much music there really is out there. ;)
GilDash: the amount of music you dont know about would make your head exploder
GilDash: Indeed, and was that face nessicary?
Ah, got to stretch my hoves out a bit, and even work on my 3rd story, dedicated to Kipkat07_Mare, who is currently not here on Bronystate. Be right back everypony.:)

Been having troubles with it for a time now.....
I seriously consider making plushies now...even if they will look terrible and noobish
that...is entirely too much for a plush.

Twi_Fi: every plush is over that price :(
Open...with my face....
didn't that got illegal for copyright?

Oh hai YamaTHou
Rainbow_dash1234789: nope.
hai YamaTHou
what?
Over $2,000!
actually, most people who buy this stuff aren't bronies, but mothers
aslfjljflsdjfjasldfjakldfjla
most bronies are poor students
Lol derpy_pony I don't think my mom would get me a plushie
There are rich individuals in all the fandoms. Just look at those who build hyper-realistic mecha cosplays. Those things go for a lot of monies
HELLO EVERYPONY!

Besides I can't drive so no hob ;A;
Dermathil: or the ones who build life size gundam statues
Hello Rainbow_dash1234789
hi Ponies47
I wouldn't say "rich", I would say "more generous" than most fandoms.
hi Rainbow_dash1234789
hi Twi_Fi
I'd say rich.
^
to me rich is more than 3 digits in the bank XD
hi derpy_pony
I can't recall the last time I saw a fanbase that donates as often as ours, or as much.
:3
welp that's another target for Hasbro
Life_Essence: this.
alexxm: I think it is actually part of the public domain, that statue. In a public park or something.
*3 digits or more
alexxm: int's amost noon and I just woke up :( This is why I hate sleep. I sleep in to late :(
*it's almost
^
derpy_pony: what did you mean most bronies are poor students?
hai Rainbow_dash1234789
It's almost 1:40 in the morning for me.
having enough disposable income to buy a $2k plushie means either rich or crazy
do*
well still i bet the guy who came up with the ideas a fan Dermathil
Life_Essence: I must be very rich with 4 then. :D
And I'm not really tired.
hi MIckael
or derpy_pony they don't have that money and buy it anyways
I was rich, then I bought a Charger
now I'm poor
So everypony what's new?
Life_Essence: Welcom to cars. :D
what if you have 5 digits, but a dash in front of it?
hello?
Russia is rainbow dash In hetalia
Oh he sure was. But Gundam is part of the japanese culture now.

Dermathil: uhh...now? like it hasnt since the mid 80s?
05my filler is done ^_^
If I had wages closer to what I was supposed to have been making three years ago, I'd have that much disposable income and more. Too bad the whole economy crashed and all. :p
Rainbow_dash1234789: welcome :)
WallDives: modern culture

I'm thinking since Zeta came out.
alexxm: Nothing much

GilDash: You won't last at your job long with that accuracy

Om: I'm a very good analyst actually. They also told me at the interview that despite my youth I had excellent people skills. ;)
is the stream down currently?
GilDash: as do I. Yet my parents did not spray their yard like they should've, thus we have to hand pick at them
Is there meant ot be anything streaming?
I HATE GARDEN WORK! :[
don't we all
GilDash: Gee, I never would have guessed.
Sylandest: Yeah, same here. Fortunately I'm at my mom's instead of my dad's and she doesn't care. :D
Om: Tsk, shows what you know. :D
It's a pain in the (squee)! :[
GilDash: your mom is now 20% cooler than mine. mine is obsessed with the yard
Ponies47: Quite. Just pave the whole thing over, I say. :D
I like Train
I win that because my parents don't care about the yard except for mowing it :3
i still can't beleive that 20percent cooler is a Partner of Bronystate XD

TheRainbowDash: I've been doing yard work. My hands are currently sore from weed picking and dirt shoveling, lol

11,01GilDash: DLC.
Terria: nope

BE A PIRATE!
GilDash: YAY, Street Fighter!
My favorite game right now is Disgaea 4
GilDash: DLC happened
Nittany_Discord: really. 2009 was the last good year
SUper meat boy :Nope
Nittany_Discord: I know, but still... :(
Nittany_Discord is Minecraft Mainstream?
11,012009 was crap for me.
I've been playing Baldur's Gate and Diablo 1
where we bought the SAMNE DAMN GAME 6 times.
11,01That's when Ubisoft announced their DRM.
/me noms on Nittany_Discord's tail.
2009 sucked...
11,01And when my cynicism flared up.
damnit, why does my stream always die when wrek is streaming? It's always fine when anything is shown, but during all the Drawing and D3 it always stops
cachi01 DRM = Dirty Rotten Moneygrubbers
XD
11,01And then Sony took OtherOS away from PS3 models they stopped making in 2007.
What is he trying to do?!
Nittany_Discord: yeah that sucked
OtherOS?
OtherOs?
also, it seems like my chat is dead too
and then Nittany_Discord hacker took down PSN
11,01The ability to install Linux on your PS3.
Nittany_Discord: 2007 was the last great year of gaming for me. I mean it was bad then, but everything became complete shit from then onwards.
Ohhhh sucky
CrimsonPhoenix: u could play ps2 games and install linux on ps3
is it tasty?
PSN more like PMS
1,3Side rooms are now open
O_O
lol Linux
thanks Nittany_Discord
I can play PS2 games on my PS3 :D
:(
11,01When GeoHot hacked the PS3 hypervisor, Sony released a firmware update that removed the option.
:[
CrimsonPhoenix: lucky you u got the first ps3
I like the euro movie night since there are way less people
11,01And then PS3 hacking exploded afterwards.
is our guy here good at drawin' or whut?
11,01Funny how the PS3 was unhacked before OtherOS was removed.
Mish: you should see more of his work.
see you guys 4 teh movie....
Why would you even need Linux on a PS3?
11,0217 min till BMN ^_^
Nittany_Discord: what is ur fav game of all time

Nittany_Discord: Possibly a "Fuck you" to Sony as well.
I love seeing good art- Like the orginal concept art for Cloudsdale....damn....
-.-
11,01It was extremely hard for GeoHot to hack the hypervisor.
Brony Movie Afternoon
Have you people seen it? It was so glorious
11,01And Sony punished everyone.
Fuck PSN. GO LUNIX
11,02Bronysith: Don't ask me that ;~;
11,01And then sued GeoHot later on.
11,02So many good games ;A;
OMG SuperBrony64

They mainly blamed it on the dancing
Mish: Because the town thinks "God doesn't allow it" or some stupid shit like that.
Mish : beacuse the priest does not like it :|
/me whisperes the secret to Mish
In our school is no food or canteen.. ;(
they blamed the car crash on....DANCING? i understand music...BUT DANCING?
...
DANCING IS FORBIDDEN

Busted for boppin'.
Because they were all doing the hustle while driving at 80 MPH
I cant dance for shit anyway

Dancing while operating a car can lead to crashing Mish

Kind of baffled.
CeilingKirz: do you watch people?

"Wanna see something?" "Sure." "Look at my amazing pony collection!" "Pretty cool, but you're missing Twilight Sparkle. How could you forget best pony?" "...."
RAWRity: YJ?
They're bringing in APACHE CHIEF? Why?
Ed Edd n' Eddy was my childhood. I love that show :) Dem Ed boys they crazy :P
CupcakeWarrior: Young Justice
CeilingKirz is watching you. ALWAYS.

Magical_pablez94: You know, you're my favorite pony after GilDash.
Ponies47 Man, EEnE kICKED ASS!
Still no.

Ponies47: I watched that show for a few seasons. I didn't like how badly they got punished for every little thing. I gave up on that show before it finished.
She's so damn crazy.

You are "Late" :O

RAWRity: that series needs more booster gold
I was shopping and getting my passport pic fixed
taken
Kandarihu You Don't Say!
I wonder how the Nostalgia Critic didn't include Ariel in the Top 11 Dumbasses in distress.
slap dat bitch
hay.
Firaga: what it needs is fewer characters.
plus fixing Windows 7's ACHI problem, fingerprint login resetting
fun stuff
Nittany_Discord: Okie Dokie Lokie! :)
Pegashy pay
He doesn't have authority over anyone but Ariel.
Dark92Enigma cause you touch urself at night
*yay
....yeah, I'm sorry, if this was my kid, I'd kinda ground her ass
its her own damn fault Dark92Enigma
Kevish_Bacon BA DUM TSS
kk
:O
I know I'm supposed to respect her desire for "independance" and whatnot but yeah, no.
:I
Because the original cast was 5 main characters, then 6, then 7, then 8, then like 14
brb/
:|
You know what was a really good TV show? That 70's Show! I love that show :)
family feud
RAWRity: theres a rule somewhere that says, no matter what show it is, if batman is in it he will steall the spotlight everytime he's on screen
So we get to see guys abs?
Wondeful
Firaga: Amazingly enough, he doesn't.

Nittany_Discord: what's the chance you might get a power outage?
Shizuka: dat Dick Tracy

Shizuka: OMG Dick Tracy!
I like trains :P
Dark92Enigma: thats what I did a few seconds ago
I miss silverscreen and his trivia :(
131947 and its color is still strong
11,01I'm more worried about lightning blowing a power supply.
DICK TRACY!?
Looks like you need to buy some hippy hips Shizuka. It's in style you know.
13dunno about you guys but i'm damn impressed that the color is still there
and she nearly hit the tornado DDT
Shizuka: My mom remembers that style. Shes 68
11,01Fun news in 1947.
Shizuka: My god, the color is still perfect
flack off
Is this the 80s version of "Step Up"?
:O
oh shit
11,01'dem 1948 prices.
Flake off, like old paint.

Kipkat07_USAF Ikr?:D Gotta love Roger

That would probably only happen in the event of a direct lightning strike.
now its a tough bar
Oh yeah

I'm amazed its legible. I could read that stuff for hours.
FALCON PAWNCH------That's it??? WHAT THE FLYING FUCK?
Dark92Enigma: It made me soooooooooooooo happy when I saw it
HUH, so...apparently Boy Bands are back to being Popular.
ded
where have I seen that actor before? the one playing the male in this scene that isn't kevin bacon?
RAWRity: really?
RAWRity: What exactly are Boy Bands?
RAWRity: 90s are coming back, in the worst possbile way.
The fatalities have been DOUBLED!
possible.
Bands of boys.
I love the Backstreet Boys
Kandarihu: eeyup. There are 2 boy bands in the top 10 on Billboard right now: One Direction and The Wanted
Not really
deep end running off - runs in family
HAHAHAHA
11,01Boy bands were more of a problem in the 2000s.
maybe if she sleeps with jesus
RAWRity: I dont listen to the radio anymore
RAWRity: thats why i only listen to techno =)
WallDives: i rather have the 50´s to comeback,those wore the times,everything was nearly perfect...Expect for racism :|
question, how can you drive off a tressle bridge like that?
I agree with Nittany_Discord! :)
Malavolent: a group of 4-6 Males who sing pop songs to garner fans in the teenage girl demographic
11,01When did we skip Grunge?
I would think the steel beams would prevent the car from going over the edge
sergio_scriptor: considering I'm a halfie, and I live with almost all black people, I dont want the 50s or 60s, tbh.
WallDives IN. THE WORST. POSSIBLE. WAY!:O
RAWRity: Oh... THOSE kinds of bands.
we now know his secret hobby FillyFlam
;o
slpa
slapped
slap
pimpslap
Daaamn.
PAWNCH
slap
Nittany_Discord: we didn't. the 2000's version of Grunge was the indie-rock that got popular in 04-07
bitchslap
Nittany_Discord didn't Grunge die with Kurt Cobain?
THIS IS WHY YOUR DAUGHTER HATES YOU
11,01Dunno.
>Never hit anyone in life
alexxm: Considering the actual character, I don't find that as much of a strech as it should be.
haha
>start with daughter
Nice going there.
11,01I wasn't into music until high school, and the boy band crap was getting popular then.
I gave up watching this. :C
11,01But I was getting into rock music.
I actualy used to like boy bands years ago
But really, I'm not at all upset about boy bands becoming a thing again. I always had a soft spot for their campiness
what are ya'lls faviorte HORROR GAMES :)
Amnesia
Nittany_Discord: I think I was the same age. Linkin Park and Korn drew me in, and I've grown since then. :)
Silent hill
/me nomz Nittany_Discord on teh ear
11,01As long as they're not forced talent like Rebecca Black.
and just bitch slap the hell outta people
DEad space 2: Severed
Mish Silent Hill... 2, probably
/me 11,01dusts KevIsh_Bacon off with a feather duster
Anyone up for "Phantasmia Goria"?
I was listening to classical and old music when i was still in the womb
slap slap slap
dutch peeps heere??
Nittany_Discord: Okay, this is something I have to say right now: lay the fuck off Rebecca Black
phantasmagoria? that FMV game?
/me dodges feather duster and continues nomming Nittany_Discord
EXPOSITION EXPOSITION rush it out ASAP
RAWRity no
Which seat should I take? (The trunk)
/me joins in the nom-pile on Nittany_Discord
11,01RAWRity: Alright.
Firaga: PHANTASMAGORIA!
waka waka waka waka
YES!
11,01It's just bad that she got popular through an awfully-written song.
GilDash are you at Rock am Ring this year because linkin park play there ?
okaay I'm gonna change my nick to my twitter nick (Melody Wings)
11,01I should say infamous.
town bans dance but not video games
pwnage
FlareChaserxOctavia: dat comment
Big Macintosh.
FlareChaserxOctavia: Needs more Octavia.
EEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYUP
what?
Nittany_Discord: she didn't get popular. She got HUMILIATED by it, to the point where she was bullied so much she left her school.
PLOT
Punch Buggy Fluttershy
hello@
DesTinyDiscord: Nah, I'm at Download this year. ;)
big mac to the rescue
Dance ban? What the (squee)?
Sexy Time?
dat plot
oh god!
11,01RAWRity: Wow.
DesTinyDiscord: 'Cause that's where Black Sabbath are! :)
gotta pander to the females sometimes I guess
Mish is still dere
jk
nekkid men!!! my eyes!!!!
alexxm: this is before the "Murder Simulators" label. Back then, video games were regarded as children's toys.
dem abs <3
is it Sexy Time?
11,01I'd blame Ark Music Factory for that.
Rebecca Black got "famous" in the same way the guy who gets tied to a flagpole naked gets famous in high school.
ah because i am there because metallica and Billy talent
Kandarihu: some of them still are seen on those eyes
Nittany_Discord: I'd blame the internet deciding to fuck with a 13 y o girl because they were bored.
right Kandarihu thanks
another dance montage
I don't think this is safe for filly eyes
RAWRity: thats actualy a tradition at cannes film festival :)
music;
wait...there is a MURDER SIMLAUTER?
where/
dancing lesson 1 clicking your fingers
Justin Beiber's new song is actually somewhat decent
Damnit, I love this song.
"How does I rythym?"
dem 80`s montage :|
11,01The internet can be cruel.
find beat, white boy
D.E.S.U
/me arrests CupcakeWarrior
CupcakeWarrior BLASPHEMY!!!!
alexxm: Is it just me, or he clicked them off the rhytm?
PFFFFFT
11,01Jessie Slaughter (but she was provoking people).
RAWRity: Yeah, chill the jets a bit. You can criticize Rebecca Black's singing without being one of the asshats who harassed her and bullied her.
/me The hour's approaching, to give it your best You've got to reach your prime. That's when you need to put yourself to the test And show us a passage of time
Nittany_Discord i heard her dad died
Nittany_Discord U Dun Goofed
/me yawns
we need a montage of a montage
yeah i dont dislike rebecca black. but bieber is an arrogant prick
Misha: about 10 years after this movie was made, was when the hysteria over violence in video games got started.
man, he's loud
11,01I'd blame Ark Music Factory more for making a shit song.
/me We're going to need a montage (montage!) Ooh it takes a montage (montage!)
Who is Jessie Slaughter?
Brock's dub of that was alight
11,01She just happened to sing it.
I'm having flashbacks to trying to get into the groove of Rhythm Heaven.
what we watching
Rebecca Black is an abomination
.....
I don't hate Rebecca Black, just her really shit song. :D
Misha: WAHAHA~
steam : FOOTLOSE
the fuck? The priest isn't stopping this?
11,01Friday sounded like it was written by a 13-year-old.
Accidentally martial arts.
"Friday, friday, stick a pin in your eye day."
that scene was not gay at all
didn't the cyber police guy die Nittany_Discord
Doesn't really matter whether it was her idea or her parents or Ark Factory's. Her singing isn't that good. That doesn't make her a bad person, it just makes her a bad singer and it's OKAY to say that >_>
11,01His Dad?
CriticKitten: Except people don't criticise her singing. THey instead try to use her as an example of how "Music today sucks" or "pop music is garbage." She's a teenager who performed a shitty song for a poorly made music video.
"Spyday Spyday, gotta murder on spyday!"
I can't be bothered to hate on whoever the designated hate target of the month is. Rebecca Black, Justin Bieber, Paris Hilton, whoever. I've got better things to do.
Sudden Back to the Future music?
Rebecca Black actually sounds better without autotune
11,01I heard that. I thought it was dispelled, though.
The guy who did that 20 minute long Fresh Prince YTP made a ponified version of Friday. Now I know why we're not seeing it on the stream.
i hate bieber because hes an arrogant pr'ing assh
I amadadmaiodmaopadijdiiiiiiiiiiii tiredåaO
well not all young singers suck,our very own applebloom is a great singer :)
yeah Jessi slaughters dad Nittany_Discord i heard he died
White People
Kandarihu: you mean Dikekike
Who is Jessie Slaughter?
this makes no sense in advancing the PLOT
why is he practicing outside a destroyed house
Firaga: eeyup
inb4 white people dancing jokes
Did you guys know Applebloom does Sweetiebelle's songs?
/me Always fade out in a montage... If you fade out it feels like more time has passed in a montage...
alexxm: because dancing is still illegal
Hey everybody!
CupcakeWarrior: girl who made some stupid videos on the internet that 4 chan got ahold of and used to mess with her.
what's on the box?
/me fades out
11,01Some girl that was a prick online. The internet backlashed at her hard.
why a destroyed house though Firaga
burning books....
Her last name IS Slaughter
CupcakeWarrior: that was her screen name
/me used tackle against GilDash. It's Super Effective!!
sergio_scriptor AND Don't forget Twilight! she has a beautiful voice IMO :)
afternoon again, everypony! :) How are you all today?
11,01And I think they got a hold of their personal info which they used to make threatening and harassing phone calls and e-mails.
CrazyCherry: Hey! :(
/me noms Sylandest
11,01Ooh. I hear sirens.
alexxm: because.......idk
/me uses water gun on CrashedRainbow.
Ashley has a good voice as well
11,01Did lightning strike something?
is that your ride?
Hey hey hey Sylandest
CupcakeWarrior: wh-wait a minute! *is being nommed*
ROCKIN voice
GilDash: All in a good cause.
Book Burning is Twilight Sparkle's worst Nightmare
Ponies47: howdy! :)
Nittany_Discord: Does that mean tornado?
11,01No.
CrazyCherry: I've got a better cause. ;)
11,01We don't have tornado sirens.
Nittany_Discord: air raid sirens?
CrazyCherry: business as usual, I see :P
11,01We don't have those.
Lighthouse Fog Horn
RAWRity: Yeah, and....? >_> It's a bad song and she's a bad singer. And it doesn't reflect well on the genre that she tried to replicate. I don't really care if people say she's proof of pop sucking or whatever, though.
Sylandest: Yesh.
wb Slyandest!
twiligt_sprinkler nuuuuuuuuuuuu
11,01It was just a police car siren.
bitchslapped
Why are we talking about Justin Beiber?
Just keep an eye on the weather, Nittany_Discord
Nonononononononnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Dark92Enigma: tyty :)
oh baby, we hate him, yeah
becuase he pops up in any conversation about music
slap dat bitch
Nittany_Discord: They're onto you. :p
I think you can read up on jessi slaughter on knowyourmeme
Whirlybird because you touch yourself at night
11,01I am, and all of the fun weather is going around me.
coming form the girl who stood in front of a train.
O.o
slaped!
KICK HIM IN THE NUTS
oh damn!
That looks decent alright.
11,01GilDash: I'll fight them off with my feather duster.
Crossed the moral event horizon there, fella.
Ariel = Zalga
NOT THE TRUCK!
and now he must die :[
she goes all carry under wood on that bitch
People say how they hate Beiber, but they never stop talking about him. I didn't even know Justin Beiber Existed till i saw all those Youtube comments everywhere about him
Nittany_Discord: *That* would be a site to see. :D
THAT WAS POINTLESS..........I know she was a bitch, but she didn't deserved THIS!:'(
you dare bring light to my lare? YOU MUST DIE! :[
She got the wrong truck, that guy isn't Tiger Woods
RAEP
11,01Police vs. Maid.
HE MUST FUCKING DIE!!!!!!!!!!
/me rages
11,01What an asshole.
Eh, Bieber's pretty bad too, but his problem is that he doesn't appear to be interested in evolving.
GilDash: so whats going on now? I wandered in while waiting for gravel to be unloaded
Nittany_Discord: That's almost as epic as ninjas vs. pirates. :D
/me gets his M16A4 and shoots him in the nuts
kill him but spare the truck it didn't do anything to you
Sylandest: *Ahem* The usual. :$
CriticKitten: that, and his handlers seem to not realize he has nowhere near the charisma to pull of the songs he sings.
Nittany_Discord : if you are afraid of lighting : best case scenario-you get hit in the head,survive,and sudently have your brain power increase,and also get youhair on fire.Worst case scenario-you die :|
Don't hit another person unless you are prepared to get hit, she hit him first. And lost the fight.
GilDash: now, when you say the usual...:D lol
11,01I'm not afraid of lightning.
Om: True, I don't really feel sorry for her.
11,01Quite the opposite.
Sylandest: Ah ha. ;)
RAWRity: True, he really lacks the presence to make songs good.
11,01I'd love to go out and film it.
Nittany_Discord: you're sexually aroused by it?
Nittany_Discord would stand outside with a lighting rod during a storm :)
CriticKitten: evolving? all he cares about is money.
/me dances in a tornado.
GilDash: yep, there's the reaction I was expecting, lol
/me licks Nittany_Discord
Malavolent: Me neither. Times were different back then I suppose
11,01RyunosukeKnT: I'm not stupid.
Nittany_Discord: you have the soul of a metorologist
11,01And don't like me.
lol\
CrazyCherry: do be careful in there!
11,01Kipkat07_USAF: I also have a degree in meteorology.

Nittany_Discord : sometimes when lighting comes i go outside with a bucket in my head and spoon in the hand...dont ask me why,its something personel :)
CriticKitten: plus nearly every song he puts out is how he's awesome and would make the most perfect boyfriend ever, when he has absolutely no way of backing it up. To borrow a phrase, h'es too big for his britches.
HNNNNGGGGG
twilight_sprinkler: That always seems to be the assumption about people who get rich. Do you happen to have quotes from him to prove your statement?

CrazyCherry: IDK :P
RAWRity: Which admittedly was a better song, but....still bad.

WAT
because dancing leads to sex
she's making out with that guy for you?
CriticKitten: you mean "My Moment"? That felt more like just a "This is my time to shine!" kind of thing.
Oh wow, I just burned my hand on a hot pocket
"When kids dance, they become sexually irresponsible"
CriticKitten: his behavior supports the statement. the example i displayed, the style of his music, dressing, behavior, always showing off, his music being cheap, his constant pr'ing
11,01All I have to do is open the shutter, and the lightning does the rest.

CriticKitten: show me a single artist who would say he only cares about money.
Sylandest: ITS A TRAP!
twilight_sprinkler: Fun question: if you had millions of dollars and had millions of people focusing on you, would you not spend any of it then?
I'm GilDash's waifu.
yes! 30min of no internet! hat did i miss?
GilDash: damn straight, haha. I'll be lucky to be able to move once I'm done
i just had a Deja-vu :O
twilight_sprinkler: Absence of evidence is not evidence.
CriticKitten: Hey, that's how music works right? As soon as somebody starts making money off of what they do, they no longer care about anything but money, right? It's not like people may work hard and earn their success at all, right?
Sylandest: I kno that feel. :D
twilight_sprinkler: theres been some of those alright
Without Internet I would die :S
I'm SuperBrony64|AFK's waifu. :D

hey RaveBrony hows your day been
GilDash: you know, I'm glad you're here, gil. You always know how to cheer me up, hehe :)
CriticKitten: please, youre just on of those people who have chosen to defend him just for the sake of it, without even being objective. his very behavior is obvious that he only cares about the money
a playboy?
how's the movie goin?
twilight_sprinkler: Defend him? Pretty sure I said not ten minutes ago that I thought his music sucked.
CriticKitten: who would wear such clothing, keep sucking up to nba players etc.
Hey alexxm, just finished Flare's pic, so its going GReat! :)
Well, as long as Justin Bieber has fans who buy up his music, he won't have any reason to change.
that vandalism
twilight_sprinkler: I'm just not dumb enough to assume that he's rich and thus only cares for money.

CriticKitten: implying im dumb? i didnt assume it on the base that he has music and spends it, youre not even listening to me.
twilight_sprinkler: Um, dunno about you, but if I could regularly talk to NBA players, you bet I'd suck up to them too.
"You don't go waving your flank around..."

where's avis?
xD
it's about shoving it to the establishment.
twilight_sprinkler: Since if you're not willing to do any asskissing, you'll never be at the top of the payscale.
CriticKitten: he got where he is thanks to PR, hes famous and the majority of people hates hi, but for such a large amount of people even a small percent of fans is enough
nope.avi
CriticKitten: so youre jsutifying asskissing?
twilight_sprinkler: "The majority of people hate him", there's another claim I'd love to see some evidence for.
CriticKitten: lol...go to "baby" on youtube and see it
twilight_sprinkler: Did Raspussin put out a poll to gauge the Bieber hate in this country? XD
GilDash: you there?
twilight_sprinkler: Ah yes, the internet, the most unbiased source for all information.
Can anypony tell me what PR is?
twilight_sprinkler: I wouldn't say the "majority" hates him. Or at least not a big enough majority to keep him from having one of the biggest selling songs in the country right now.
CriticKitten: there have been many polls, most people hate him

Oh, so that's why booze and heroin always appears in my hand whenever I dance.

You realize neither of you can convince the other one that you are right, right?
I got torrents of MLP downloading now. They work fine, but VLC's audio isn't great.
twilight_sprinkler: Well, if you refuse to back your claims then OBVIOUSLY you're willing to admit you're mistaken, otherwise you'd just be trolling and surely you wouldn't do that right?
CAN be. That's why you resort to discernment, not blanket judgmentalism.
inb4 no mom
Everypony likes everypony :D
Dark92Enigma: you're welcome :)
CriticKitten: you could spend 20 secs on google and find a billion polls but instead you focus on arguing
twilight_sprinkler: "percentages" doesn't matter. He's got enough people willing to buy his music that his albums have gone platinum in 5 different countries, 3x Platinum in the US and Canada.
Hello again
SuperBrony64|AFK you are so much better than superbrony32

Evening everypony
That means 15 Million people, give or take, were willing to pay money for his music. Who gives even a single fuck that people on 4Chan said he sucks? it clearly hasn't hurt his sales in any significant way.
Hello Yokupony
movie needs moar DJPON3
proposal rejected, next one
twilight_sprinkler: You're trying to provoke me, but it won't work. If you refuse to prove your claims with evidence, don't bother making them.
11,01RAWRity: And sales is what matters.
hey Yokupony hows your day been
CARBAGE DAY!
RAWRity: no, divide those by the amount of albums, because his crazed fans buy all his albums
Nittany_Discord: as far as measuring success as a performer, yes.
MY CABBAGES!
wait a second...i just noted something. WJERE IS SEA LYRA ?!
11,01If everyone hated you, but you made millions, would you change your PR?
alexxm: pretty awesome, I saw my friend carry the Olympic torch :)
Yokupony: Awesome!
MY CABBAGES!
11,01Especially if it meant risking losing money.
twilight_sprinkler: Okay, so divide by two. That's still nearly EIGHT MILLION people willing to buy your album.
where was that Yokupony
Yokupony: Did you get pictures?
people don't need to love him, they need to talk about him and buy his music
CriticKitten: provoking you? im suggesting you actually do jack shit before talking about this. everywhere i go see the same, adults hating him, teenage girls defending him
this guy sure has a thing for pits
What is RAWRity going on about now?
Nittany_Discord: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
Yokupony You mean Kevin Silva?
who are you talking about btw?
Dat MPC
Justine Bieber
11,01Of course, that's what's cause the gaming industry to be crap.
twilight_sprinkler: No, you're suggesting I do your research for you. That's not how educated debates work.
11,01It's broke, but it's making money.
11,01So no-one's fixing it.
Can't believe you're actually arguing about Justin Bieber. Can't we keep a single chat Bieber free, at least during movie streams?
alexxm: It went form Cardiff to Swansea and I caught it in one of the "off the beatten track" towns :)
fornicate
Nittany_Discord: thats what business is about, just like bieber, just like gaming, PR is all thats important, screw quality
:O
OH SHIT
another slap incomin....WHAT?
Oh shit
:O
We're not Catholic!
That's the same reason Michael Bay gives not even a single fuck about what people say online about the transformers movie. He's made 2 BILLION DOLLARS off of them, so clearly he's doing something "right" to get that many people to fork over money to see his films.
People that hate Justin Beiber sure do love to talk about him to everyone they know

AM I the only pony who who reaching into the flames and pull out the burning books
Hes that voice that makes you say fuck you to the people you hate
Books of the future!
twilight_sprinkler: I'm not the one who needs to. In educated debate, when you make a claim, you provide evidence. Burden of proof is on you to back your assertions.
btw...where are the black people?
2 minutes after saying the opposite? YOU HYPOCRITE
In my headcanon, he was burning the Twilight books
CriticKitten: I can see some people wanting to do so, if they're more in it for "artistic merit" or something to that degree, but most people don't particularly care about that.
11,01Lol.
This reminds me of Farenheit 451
11,01Twilight wasn't around when that movie was made.
"Burn a book! Save a tree!"
No dont burn Twilight, she doesnt like that
Nittany_Discord: I said headcanon
oh noes did somepony start a religious debate
RAWRity: Fair enough. The number of folks who change their methods and truly evolve beyond their original scope is sadly small.
Poor Twilight Sparkle would have had conniptions.
11,01But burning books adds CO2 to the atmosphere.
"Oh, Roger Ebert gave my movie 2 thumbs down? Let me wipe my tears away with my 100 dollar bills"
hello good sir
RAWRity: One reason I respect Linkin Park, actually.
i just love how there are people in the chat arguing about jb,and the rest just does not give a fuck :)
burning books is like killing part of twilights soul
CriticKitten: its my own evidence. if i were to compile the people i talked it to it with, and its around several hundred, itd support the claim. not to mention that everyone else says the same, so that increases the chances that youre wrong.
LordPlanketh: Hey bro
sirpeckerish, my bro is on
Plants need CO2. It's what gives us breathable oxygen, and food.
RAWRity do you also want me to play the world
Any pony gunna tell me what film this is?
A music based movie spawning music based arguments
footloose
SirPeckerish: Footloose.
twilight_sprinkler: So do it.
SirPeckerish : FOOTLOSE
RAWRity do you also want me to play the world's smallest violin
Home page? What's that?
Meh. Never seen it. Is it good?
dang it! internet derped on me'
No, it is average, but the music is awesome
SirPeckerish : more or less,but its insanely corny
Average film is average
Dancing OF THE FUTURE
CriticKitten: I'll give LP that, I generally dislike their music but they've certainly tried to grow and change as artists.
Nowadays, the EPA is being as bullish as this preacher was until a couple of scenes ago.
Skerferce fer Er Merver
twilight_sprinkler: You keep saying that you have irrefutable evidence that Bieber is hated by the majority of people, so go ahead. I'm still waiting patiently on your proof. Non-internet opinion polls from reputable sources would be preferable.
sergio_scriptor: Meh. Corny is good ocasionly.
CriticKitten: google pictures about him and look at how many teenage girls are there
Ok what is the best Disney Pixar film?

SirPeckerish: It's about dancing, earning Darwin awards and stuff.
that's deep bra
twilight_sprinkler: Because, again, it's not my job to prove YOUR argument. :p
SirPeckerish: It's about a town where dancing is banned, and a guy who wants to bring it back.
twilight_sprinkler: It's yours.
When the remake comes out......NC would probably do an OLD VS NEW, right?
ER KER KERVERSHBRERNER

Sounds interesting.

and i still cant belive we are going to have more 15 minutes of nothing that its important to the story before the movie ends.i mean seriously the movie could end right after the priest final speech and it would be the same :|
Danceing is interesting in general.

KevIsh_Bacon: Not so much a debate, anymore. :P
CriticKitten: dont think youre right because you refuse to do ANYTHING and just expect everything to be handed to you on a silver platter. youre supposed to make effort as well, i gave precise enough instructions, you ignored that, which is evidence.
And another
/me pets SuperBrony64|AFK
and again
OBJECTION!
/me is petted ^-^
Whirlybird: yes because googling three words is so fucking hard
CupcakeWarrior let us hope so
twilight_sprinkler: But you aren't making any effort.
Paranormal Activity FOUR?!
WHY?
I don't get it. I thought they where aloud to dance.
Whirlybird: i already googled it.
Why won't they let Paranormal Activity die already.
Hey, the lottery was held yesterday?
CAKES PIES AND DESSERT'S O MY! :D
Whirlybird: hes the one who isnt makin g any effort
twilight_sprinkler: then link him whatever sources that back up your claims
twilight_sprinkler: Again, I already stated that our debate has ended. You have refused to provide evidence for your claims so I am disinterested in arguing with circular logic relying only on your own personal feelings.
telling someone to look up evidence for YOUR argument wouyld get you laughed out of any debate worth it's salt.
11,01And then they all died.
11,01And the banned dancing again.
Saying something and not providing evidence of it yourself to the other party is what is known in the business as pulling things out of your ass.
...lol
Nittany_Discord: And earned Darwin awards.
There is a distinct lack of Darwin in this movie.
Just Dance you to.
Pfft.

Lordplanketh: No. And talk me by saying SirPeckerish:
CriticKitten: i provided evidence, just not in the elementary form for your lazyness you wanted, you ignored that evidence
Nittany: Not even your fault. And I'm done. :P
Nittany_Discord: You manage to do that really well, don't cha. :D
Nittany_Discord: What if the movie is like, Rocky or Rambo?

Pinkie just layed an egg
then came the rape
dat glomp
In all honesty...no. Luna DOESN'T need to appear in Season 3, or at least not have another episode. There's...really not much else you can do with her character that wouldn't feel like a bad fanfic at this point.
Litwick: what the hell is the deal with mass effect 3

11,01I don't like RP beyond the light RP of Maid Hour.
Ninjazz: Well, he self-kicked himself.:D
But RPing gets annoying for those of us in a chat where it shouldn't be.
Airpuff|Tipsy: Go on. Otherwise I'll think of something to do with them.
TheRainbowDash: All is forgiven. :D
Wrek and sumica still at D?
One does not simply ignore the rules.
11,01The heavy stuff isn't allowed here.
Ninjazz: I do not forgive....o_o (nah, I kid)
alexxm i have been watching eurovision.... and sweden won YESS!!!!!
"heavy stuff". XD

Golakka: yeah its ordinary pop song
Mission Success! :D

Airpuff|Tipsy: IF you're drunk, this shouldn't hurt too much...
Ninjazz: What did you do.
Golakka: but most eurovision songs are

DitzyHooves: Oh ummm, I know that alexxm won pony episode 2, and that "Strike Commando" will be showing, that's all I know.
11,01That's a large bra size.

Airpuff|Tipsy: I'll do as many as I can fit. ;)
11,01DitzyHooves: Not you.

Invi: Any time, my friend. :)
Smooth jazz is smooth

03whent he Zune HD came out, it was 16 and 32GB only
OMB|OompaLoompa: Indeed.
Airpuff|Tipsy: I think I'm going to take a leaf out of my good friend PONY's book and try some science. :)
03so I bought myself a personalized/engraved 32GB with my name on the back and stuff
The better quesiton is, can the club handle it?
DitzyHooves: which?
03a couple weeks later they released a 64GB >_>
Ninjazz /)
Invi: (\
the whole thing
TheRainbowDash is still best pony
GilDash: Make sure the test is repeatable.

10Oh, all 16 gym badges and Red
TheRainbowDash: then maybe some sleep is in order?
Ninjazz: In my eyes, it has two definitions.
Meh ima take a shower people.. all... this heat >.<
10All the other websites lied, Serebii was the only truthful one
TheRainbowDash: One definition, in mine. :|
WallDives: Well, now, I am wide awawke.:D
hearing my little 11 year old hater brother raging over COD is fun :D
Ninjazz: did I miss anything while I was washing up?
Man, fuck this heat
(awake)
I didn't even get winter
Sylandest: MmmmmNope.
cachi01: fun, and disappointing.
Petrified_Discord: I agree -.-
This is a motherfucking copout
Sylandest: But YOU! Tell me... Tell me all that happened.... NOW!
How is it the 21st century and we STILL don't control weather?
Tellmetellmetellmetellme!
WallDives: lol why dissapointing?
Petrified_Discord: ahaahha yeah xD
I am sad. EQD didn't even bother reading past my first chapter. It must be really really bad.
Petrified_Discord: Logic has played us for so long now. - Science
Ninjazz: goodness, somepony's worried for me, hehe :$
Sylandest: Something like that. o_O
Might wanna check your sources there, TheRainbowDash :D
Ninjazz: Simply put, nothing but good happened. I am unharmed and whole :)
00,10Sorry to hear that flutter_spin
flutter_spin: *pats your back* It'll be all okay, and hey, can you provide me a link to your story?
/me sighs
who here is from the UK?
00,10I liked it
Ninjazz: were you expecting something else? :P
Well its ok. I redid it and thought it was awesome. They didn't like my pacing and didn't bother going on to the next chapter
"The funny thing about quotes is that you can never be sure if they're real or not." -Benjamin Franklin
Petrified_Discord: My sources aer obviously credible and cleared.:D
I didn't even edit the first part
Ninjazz: You're awfully worried for Sylandest. Got a crush on him? ;)
EQD happens to everyone flutter_spin
GilDash: I think he does.
GilDash: No. Something else entirely. :|
cachi01: because people like me (decent players and/or older players, regarless of genre) have to put up with some kid who hasnt even reached puberty, talk garbage.
But that all changed when the fire nation attacked
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid if you want to see the revisions
Petrified_Discord: HOW CAN WE KNOW IF THAT QUOTE IS REAL?
sorry, wall.
WallDives: XD indeed
phone call from brother. hangon
Thus is why I find the EQD script somewhat annoying
WallDives: nah thats not a wall
Rainbow: Wait, do you have a stream? I do not....
cachi01: "Don't make me come down there!" -God (paraphrase)
