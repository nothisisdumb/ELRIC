<valoreins|Work> incoming text wall to discuss
<valoreins|Work> The Hub has confirmed picking up My Little Pony for its summer 2012 lineup. The Hub has placed an order for thirteen episodes, with writers Meghan McCarthy, Cindy Morrow, M.A. Larson and Dave Polsky returning to the show, and story editor for the first and second seasons Rob Renzetti replaced by Meghan McCarthy. McCarthy has been called "showrunner" in an April 2012 article in the online edition of the L.A. Times.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ?
<Princess_Cadence> ooooooooooooooooooooooook
<Life_Essence> dishwasher_EXTREME Binding of Isaac and Bastion
<Vordox> 13?!
<valoreins|Work> most of the awesome storywriters are still there
<valoreins|Work> :D
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ?
<WallDives> huh.
<valoreins|Work> but... no ms. Amy?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so many games are coming out WOO HOO!!!!
<Ghosties> 04Vordox?
<Princess_Cadence> i have no idea what is going on right now :L
<Vordox> Ghosties: You know we spoke of tai Fu and such before, right?
<Vordox> Do you remember the SHAPE of the Evil villian in the First Kung Fu Panda game. DIDN'T that strike you rather...
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Princess_Cadence is has been a very long time since i last saw you......
<Princess_Cadence> i know..
<Ghosties> 04I never played the first Kung Fu Panda game :p
<Vordox> No, I meant the movie =P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> game base on movies in my view are never good
<Vordox> dishwasher_EXTREME: True, but there are exceptions.
<yifle1> see ya later
<NightSide15> agreed
<Life_Essence> bck to the future
<Vordox> Lord of the Rings for the games was prrtty decent
<Life_Essence> the new one
<Ghosties> 04Right, Tai Lung
<Vordox> (Not the MMO but the single player ones)
<Life_Essence> by Telltale
<Ghosties> 04Who is a tiger
<Vordox> Ghosties: And rather "spikey" but not the same
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ok back to thr future is good
<Vordox> BUt what if Tai Fu was the father? :p
<NightSide15> dear god
<Vordox> THAT STRETCH
<Ghosties> 04Getting into fanfic territory now, Vordox
<dishwasher_EXTREME> no stream ?
<Vordox> Derp.
<Vordox> dishwasher_EXTREME: No stream, I wish I could hijack it but...meh
<Life_Essence> you mean slashfic
<dishwasher_EXTREME> cant wait to play assassin's creed 3 and and halo 4
<Ghosties> 04I'm sure there's zero continuity or connection between Tai Fu and Kung Fu Panda, but there's no denying that there certainly is a similarity and perhaps a foundation for Kung Fu Panda within Tai Fu
<Vordox> dishwasher_EXTREME: Not buying them
<Princess_Cadence> wait...what? Vinyl_Scratch VinylScratch and Vynil_Scratch?? wat.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> why?
<Life_Essence> I want to play Grand Theft Assasin's Creed
<Vordox> Ghosties: I need to replay the game to get the better image of this. ><
<Life_Essence> I mean Watchdog
<Princess_Cadence> Life_Essence that would be cool
<dishwasher_EXTREME> :D thats so true
<Vordox> My buys = Rayman Legends, Last of Us, Lara Croft, And MAAAAYBE Watch Dogs. :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so......this is weird
<Vordox> Think about it
<Vordox> Lara Croft gets MORE BRUISED THEN F*CKING KRATOS
<Vordox> Lara > Kratos
<WallDives> so...am I the only one that got a 2006 E3 vibe from this year?
<Life_Essence> sequals only?
<Life_Essence> thats normal for E3
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ill buy halo; assassin's creed;black ops
<Vordox> Not only sequels
<alexxm> valoreins|Work why only 13 episodes
<valoreins|Work> dunno im not working there lol
<dishwasher_EXTREME> the new black ops seems cool but i wish they would mix the gameplay a little bit more ..
<Life_Essence> what? COD change gameplay? BLASPHEMY
<NightSide15> bf3 is best shooter
<dishwasher_EXTREME> running around shooting things tens to get bored
<Life_Essence> COD: Map Pack 5

<Life_Essence> nah much easier than a heli
<Ghosties> 04Buys from E3: Assassin's Creed III, The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, and definitely Watch Dogs and maaaaaaaaaybe Beyond
<Vordox> The Hub reported that "Hearts and Hooves Day", an episode on the theme of Valentine's Day, which aired on February 11, 2012, in the middle of the second season, was the show's most-viewed episode ever, and the second highest of any program of the Hub network; its viewership exceeded 150% of that of the previous year

<VioletGreySha> :3
<Life_Essence> I was just looking through my cupboard of many hundreds of games
<Kandarihu> I have a theory that digital cable boxes function as neilson boxes, sending complete data on everything that all viewers watch.
<Ninjazz> Magical_pab|Lunch: Me?... :S
<Dovakhin> k im back
<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: eeyep. *can't hold an evil laugh*

<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: oh fuck i derped
<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: sorry i'm an idiot
<Twi_Fi> VioletGreySha: Should I PM the details now, or wait until I'm next on the list?
<Ninjazz> Magical_pab|Lunch: Why is that? :P
<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: dammit!
<Kandarihu> Therefore, if everyone with The HUB were to tune in during the marathon, and then all change off upon Derpy being censored, it might send a message that we don't like the cen... then again, I kind of accept the reasoning behind that.
<Ninjazz> I'm not Meanwhile. :D
<Twi_Fi> Ninjazz: :O
<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: i know sorry!
<ACS13123> Whos Meanwhile :P

<Ninjazz> I see Sith is still talking about the parade.
<Magical_pab|Lunch> Ninjazz: ikr? btw sorry again. i'm really tired :D
<Kandarihu> Maybe if I stick to playing Medic, and never switch off the Medigun.
<Ninjazz> Oh, I see what you're saying.
<Ninjazz> It's fine, Magical_pablez94. I was surprised that someone would write about me atfirst. :$
<Onyxia> func_precipitation is best entity
<XAX> Ninjazz: Waitwhat
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: well sooner or later someone will :D maybe i will.:D

<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: Ah, well. If anything, its probably going to be about something I'd rather not be written about. :$
<Chimera> Bleh x.x
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: ...never say never Role Playing will conquer the whole world sooner or later !
<Kandarihu> I know this makes me sound like a noob and adds another black mark on my permanent record. But where do I put that IP address?
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Kandarihu> Okay. So I'm a noob for not knowing where to put in the IP address.
<XAX> Ninjazz: I was expecting a whole story
<XAX> I can only see the image on my iPod
<Ninjazz> No. No. No, Kandarihu. It does not.
<Ninjazz> XAX: I'll hold the link for you.

<ACS13123> Ninjazz: thing is there seems to be a TON of stuff needed to download...
<ACS13123> Ninjazz: for the server :P
<Kandarihu> I have to be VERY careful about that. Permanent hot water, after all.
<Ninjazz> Indeed... That's probably a good reason why I don't want to join.
<ACS13123> Ninjazz: ok then...
<Ninjazz> What do you mean by that, Kandarihu? :S
<HyperMetalLugia> :v
<ACS13123> Permanant hot water

<Ascendant> I accidentally left traffic logging on last night
<ACS13123> not long to join now...
<HyperMetalLugia> when the CPU/GPU is set to power saving mode
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Ninjazz> Nice.
<Princess_Molestia> Nice job Scarlet.
<Ascendant> and the disk IO was too much
<Ascendant> so it went into read-only
<HyperMetalLugia> :C
<Ascendant> and I tried to reboot
<Scarlet> Thanks:)
<Ascendant> but apparently the filesystem is also <censored> up
<HyperMetalLugia> Did it break?
<ScriptBot> Please do not swear. You have sworn 31 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> you could rebuild it
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<ACS13123> Dat Motorbikes...

<Ascendant> "I would like to let you know that the server does not boot because it is
<Ascendant> unable to locate the root partition by UUID and drops into initramfs."

<HyperMetalLugia> What a paintrain
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> UUIDs are terrible
<Ascendant> I might check grub and see if anything happened there
<HyperMetalLugia> Why can't it just do the /sda1234
<Ascendant> I tried mounting
<VioletGreySha> there hes gon
<VioletGreySha> gone*
<HyperMetalLugia> Borkmount?

<Ascendant> I do, HML
<Ascendant> which I should be able to do from rescue
<Ascendant> once the stupid mounting works
<Ninjazz> Nice.
<rainbow> hi:$
<Ascendant> it's mainly the BNC stuff honestly
<Ascendant> the rest are just IRCds and such
<VioletGreySha> dat Sarah name change xD
<Ascendant> nothing I can't easily redo
<Ninjazz> Oh hello, rainbow.
<VioletGreySha> hay rainbow
<Sylandest> howdy, rainbow!
<HyperMetalLugia> wow that is sad
<HyperMetalLugia> I got past all the school's blocking
<Life_Essence> I wish I had a dedicated room to recording
<HyperMetalLugia> by using googledns
<imgur> Anypony still have school?
<Chimera> LOLWHAT
<Chimera> I wish my school was that easy
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Night :D All :P Airpuff Twi_Fi and rest of Bstate :P :P:
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Shane. :)
<Vordox> BRB!
<Chimera> My tech guys know about tech to an extent
<Chimera> This is a problem
<Chimera> As in my school's tech guys btw
<Sylandest> night, Alicorn_Prince_Shane! take care
<Vordox> GOING TO BUY MY WII AND RHYTHM HEAVEN FEVER!
<|Discord|> That was fun
<Vordox> so excited!
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane jumps into his bed at the speed of light
<Alexx> Vordox: have fun
<Ascendant> same Chimera
<valoreins|Work> pinkie told me to get out more... BUT I HAVE WORK!
<Ascendant> my tech guys are awesome but annoyingly knowledgeable
<Ascendant> I've hacked into the wireless
<Ascendant> but nothing else yet
<ACS13123> the fun has been DOUBLED
<HyperMetalLugia> have you tried googleDNS?
<HyperMetalLugia> xD
<HyperMetalLugia> though I figured it was DNS blocking
<Lil_B> imgur I still have school until July
<Alexx> ACS13123: yup
<LordCelestia> 0,5Mornin'
<Alexx> morning LordCelestia
<imgur> y'know why mah nick is "imgur"?
<Ascendant> mine isn't DNS blocking
<Ascendant> I use a local DNS server usually
<Ascendant> so that'd bypass everything
<Ascendant> if it was DNS
<Ascendant> I have to use a proxy before connecting to the internet
<Ascendant> and school DNS servers
<HyperMetalLugia> So, what do the do for blocking?
<Lil_B> is my chat dead?
<Ascendant> whitelist
<Ninjazz> Ohey, LordCelestia!
<HyperMetalLugia> You'll be able to beat it one day
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh nooo
<HyperMetalLugia> ;-;
<Ascendant> I've tried
<Ascendant> it's very hard
<HyperMetalLugia> You could get a job
<Ninjazz> Is it because of the website, imgur?
<HyperMetalLugia> and a 3G modem
<Ascendant> I've beaten it in the past
<HyperMetalLugia> and use that at school
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Ascendant> but they figured out the methods and blocked it
<HyperMetalLugia> lolouch
<Ascendant> so atm I only have a really crap web proxy
<Ascendant> that only works for about 10% or less of sites
<Ascendant> of course
<Ascendant> I could get a teacher's login
<Ascendant> which isn't hard
<Sylandest> Lil_B: no, we're just all waking up or tired, lol
<Ascendant> and I'd be happy with that since barely anything is blocked there
<Ascendant> they use blacklist instead of whitelist
<Ascendant> and they don't do portblocking
<imgur> YES. And it's relation to reddit. Was insplred when my nick yesterday was "twentypercentcooler", and every time someone posted a link to that site, I was pinged.
<Ninjazz> Or off doing something else. :D
<Ninjazz> Heh. :D
<Lil_B> Sylandest yeah, the chat has been a lottle bit slow since the E3 livestreams XD
<HyperMetalLugia> ourschool
<HyperMetalLugia> Blocks all the ports
<Sylandest> Lil_B: we're all tired from it, lol. So many games..and also so many "noooooo"s, lol
<Ascendant> of course
<HyperMetalLugia> except HTTPS and 80
<HyperMetalLugia> :|
<XAX> *turns on bedroom light* and twi is still staring down apon me
<Ninjazz> :l
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, you could try to do ophcrack on a teacher PC one day xD
<Ninjazz> D:
<Ascendant> I could infect every single computer with a keylogger
<HyperMetalLugia> The only problem with ophcracking here is > Network passwords
<Ascendant> I don't need ophcrack
<Ascendant> who does when you have a keylogger?
<Ascendant> I'd just konboot
<Sylandest> XAX: isn't that a good thing? lol
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> U bad haxor
<Ascendant> get into the local admin account
<Ninjazz> Dat Smile <3
<Sylandest> awww
<Ascendant> and then install keyloggers that spread via usb
<Sylandest> yay!
<Ninjazz> XAX: Not if you know what he has to see everytime he does. :D
<Ascendant> ???
<Ascendant> PROFIT
<Ascendant> of course, there's the issue of C&Cs
<Ninjazz> I mean, Sylandest. 6_9
<Ascendant> but I could just have it save the stuff on the computers locally
<Sylandest> hehehe
<Ascendant> but then I'd be at risk
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay ownernname?
<Lil_B> well, I off too then, see you later people
<Ascendant> tho
<Ninjazz> Cya Lil_B! Take care.
<Twi_Fi> See ya Lil_B
<Sylandest> laters, Lil_B!
<HyperMetalLugia> You can frame somebody
*Lil_B hugs Ninjazz Twi_Fi and Sylandest
<Ninjazz> :)
<Ascendant> alternatively I could set it so that it logs stuff that's typed into the winlogon process
*Gunthler looks for a friend to talk to :3
<valoreins|Work> oh bai Lil_B
<Ascendant> and if it's a successful audit it'll save to its files
<Ninjazz> Always one here for ya, Gunthler. :D
<Ascendant> and then I'll have it so it's easy to delete logs
<Gunthler> Yay
<valoreins|Work> everypony here is talkable, right..?
<HyperMetalLugia> hidden file on a network drive?:
<Ninjazz> I must be in a happy mood or something. :$
<Ascendant> not network drive
<Malavolent> Sure.
<Ascendant> local
<Ninjazz> Most times, I am. :$
<Ascendant> it's easy to tell if teachers are there
<Sylandest> Hey, no complaints here, Ninjazz
<Sylandest> A happy pony is a happy pony
<Gunthler> Right now I'm playing RuneScape and I'm getting bored :D
<valoreins|Work> guys look at this... http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled1.png
<Sylandest> valoreins|Work: I am told I talk very much, yes
<Ascendant> it's also fun cus' our school doesn't have cameras
<Ascendant> just motion sensor
<Ascendant> s
<valoreins|Work> mm hmm
<Ascendant> because of privacy issues
<HyperMetalLugia> most of the schools here have cameras lol
<Ascendant> like if someone was changing in front of the camera
*Magical_pablez94 is waiting for CrazyCherry
<HyperMetalLugia> > Next to america so not a surprise
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Danial> guys
<Danial> guys
<Ascendant> but yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> There are no cameras in the bathrooms thou
<HyperMetalLugia> gh
<Ascendant> tbh keyloggers are far more simplistic than bruteforcing
<Sylandest> valoreins|Work: that pic...scary...but true XD
<valoreins|Work> how could a shy and sensitive pony like Fluttershy could embrace the cycle of life?
<Life_Essence> TEH CIRCLE OF LIFE
<Ninjazz> Ah well. Fish are food. Not friends. :D
<xles> It's always the silent ones...
<HyperMetalLugia> How'd you code it
<Sylandest> valoreins|Work: fish are fish. I eat fish all the time. They are most delicious
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Crappy directinput
<Gunthler> What does the internet think about ponies, today? :D
<valoreins|Work> i was expecting a fanfiction that explains fluttershy's hardship dealing with death of animals because of the cycle of life thing
<ACS13123> I DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING CELESTIA!
<ACS13123> :P
<ACS13123> i just got killed
<ACS13123> alot
<Sylandest> valoreins|Work: I'm sure somepony like fluttershy has learned that early on and is used to it by now
<|Discord|> Gunthler: It still loves it
<Gunthler> Great! :D

<Ninjazz> Wrek tends to do that to ponies, Vordox. :D
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: I feel absolutely no shame here :D slight embarassment, maybe, but otherwise I'm happy :$
<Vordox> Ninjazz: I don't think I've seen anyone of it being R34 =P
<Airpuff> Sylandest: ... you've been tainted..
<Ninjazz> Vordox: Wrek's talent non the less.
<[iPad]JRP2234> ...
<Sylandest> Airpuff: if this is what its like being tainted, I am perfectly ok with this
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, who?
<Airpuff> Sylandest: Welcome to my world :D
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: The AJ picture, it's R34. :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> where?
<Vordox> or..."it became"
<Sylandest> Airpuff: huzzah! The tainted ones have been doubled!
<Vordox> Wreky's DA
<Airpuff> Sylandest: indeed :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh my~
<CrimsonPhoenix> now that's juicy
<Sylandest> CrimsonPhoenix: eeyup :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> face look odd though
<Vordox> I'm disliking it, big time. D:
*Sylandest now has trigger reaction to the word "juicy" :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh shush Vordox
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: You're not an AJ FAN! =P
<Ninjazz> You're welcome, Sylandest. :D
<Airpuff> Vordox: .. I am :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> you can just erase that line and BAM Sfw
<Sylandest> Vordox: I am a major AJ fan, lol
<|Discord|> LOVE,Y U SO COMPLEX!?
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: *squee* :$
<|Discord|> yay
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: dat picture is... "bueno"
<CrimsonPhoenix> also I am a fan of Rarity and I follow lil miss rarity tumblr
<Airpuff> Bronysith: Agree. :D
<Vordox> as a fan of the proper character that is AJ, I find the image revolting, HIGHLY revolting. ._.
<Sylandest> by the way, Ninjazz, where did you find this music? It's actually rather good
<Vordox> And I say that with the basis of who she has been and who she is in the MLP
<Ninjazz> I see you're still one of the good ones, Vordox.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gosh
<derpy_pony> hi bronystate :)
<Airpuff> Vordox: .. who know.. might be she's like that..
<Airpuff> :D
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: YouTube is a treasure trove. :)
<Sylandest> morning, derpy_pony
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: indeed it is, lol
<Ninjazz> Hey derpy_pony!
<Airpuff> morning derpy_pony
<Sylandest> Airpuff: we never do see what happens when the cameras go off...:D
<derpy_pony> 16:14 here ^^
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: I actually found it when I was looking for Portal 2's jazz song. :$
<derpy_pony> but...morning
<Vordox> Airpuff: According to her whole biography based on the MLP Show...no =P
<Airpuff> Sylandest: .. indeed..
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: haha, but it works! It's actually really good
<Airpuff> Vordox: who knows.. If you had written a biography.. would you mention.. it ALL? :D
<derpy_pony> youtube has a few pearls, yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh Vordox seriously
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's 34 of everything
<Vordox> Doesn't mean it's acceptable, CrimsonPhoenix
<Vordox> Don't mix those up
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just accept it and move on
<DitzyHooves> hello?
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's inevitable
<Ninjazz> It's the internet, Vordox.
<Vordox> Invetible?
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<Vordox> No wonder the world is going to shit if that happens
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes R34 is inevitable
<Sylandest> and now that the music has stopped, imma get me some breakfast
<Vordox> Have fun World, you're screwed.
<derpy_pony> be happy it's only 34...you don't wanna know what the japanese did with the material
<Ninjazz> Doesn't mean you have to look for it, Vordox. :P
<Airpuff> Vordox: you pressed the link... :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh boy Vordox
<CrimsonPhoenix> You would manage to last 10 second in /d/
<CrimsonPhoenix> wouldn't**
<Vordox> I've been one of the supervisors of Internet since BEFORE it was released in common hands CrimsonPhoenix
<Vordox> Don't tempt me
<Airpuff> /d/?
<Ninjazz> I admire Vordox actually. So few ponies who actually care about canon and actual morals of the show.
<Airpuff> Whats that?
<derpy_pony> the internet belongs to us now...live with it
<CrimsonPhoenix> That some big position you claim to be
<Vordox> Why do you think I admire the ideal of Love and Tolerate.
<Vordox> "just cause"?
*CrazyCherry yawns.
<Ninjazz> Before it was just a weapon for anti trolling? :S
<Sylandest> oh, I just had an idea!
<Sylandest> something to pass the time for everypony and give us something to do
*Ninjazz gives CrazyCherry some coffe
<Airpuff> Vordox: wether or not you dislike the intentions behind the picture, it is awesomely made, and if you have troubles making the devide between the r 34 and the real show, i would jsut reccomend not looking at the r34 pictures at all >.>
<Ninjazz> coffe*
<[iPad]JRP2234> Rubbish
<Ninjazz> I think he already knows that... :S
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: I don't drink coffee.
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: tea, perhaps? *holds up glass of said drink*
*Ninjazz takes back the coffee and offers CrazyCherry tea instead
<Ninjazz> Back off, Sylandest. :D
<Vordox> Airpuff: I said, as a artform of what Wrek talent is, I like it, I just don't like the content. =P
<Sylandest> I was here first! :D
<Ninjazz> You sure about that? :P
<Sylandest> ....damn you and your time powers
<Airpuff> Vordox: yeah, but some people enjoy the content too, i see your case, but we already know the problems behind it
<Ninjazz> :3
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: Sure! :)
*Ninjazz gives CrazyCherry some delicious tea
<Lighty> 06relieved :3~~~~
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: mee tooo!!!!
<Ninjazz> If coffee ain't the answer, tea is.
<CrazyCherry> Ninjazz: Thanks!
<Sylandest> well, fine, I'll just drink my tea myself...nopony wants my tea anyway *huffs*
*Ninjazz gives Airpuff some delicious tea
*CrazyCherry sips on the tea.
<Vordox> Airpuff: I'm just not liking the idea where the boundaries of what is acceptable keeps diminishing, it'caused havoc in our world far too many times, and repeating the same occasion again, wether real or digital, it'll happen again.
<derpy_pony> cruel world
<Ninjazz> I appear to be out of tea... None for me.. :S
<[iPad]JRP2234> Damit
<Sylandest> agh, im supposed to be getting food
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mmmmh I believe we need to stop before we realize that we're looping the argument
<Vordox> And that's where the world is going, total accepting to whatever that is...
*Sylandest offers Ninjazz his tea
<[iPad]JRP2234> Is there a stream
<Vordox> That vision alone scares the Jeebus out of me.
*Ninjazz takes Sylandest's offer and drinks it heartily
<Ninjazz> :3
<Ninjazz> Thanks, my friend. :)
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: huzzah, I'm useful!
<Sylandest> you're welcome :)
<derpy_pony> Vordox: fighting the sunset might not be less wise...just accept it...that how humans are, always were, always will be
<derpy_pony> +s
<Airpuff> Vordox: There are boundaries, clear boundaries, but if you enter a certain part of the internett, they are changed. I dont really see anything wrong with the picture, other than it is pornographic, which is considered a taboo no matter what you say. Pony or human, dosent matter.
<Sylandest> and everypony? I have an idea to give us something to do while we wait for stream to live again, if anypony's interested
<Ninjazz> I'm really liking that Vordox isn't one of the fucked up people on the internet.
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: Shoot.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: find a song that you feel describes you or a part of you. Got the idea after listening to your jazz music, hehe
<Ninjazz> ;3
<derpy_pony> I haven't even seen said pic. Link plox?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> *sniff**sob*
<Vordox> Airpuff: full freedom of speech.
<Airpuff> Vordox: indeed.
<Vordox> That is what the internet stand for.
<Sylandest> I'll throw mine out for a start: Jamiroquai, Virtual Insanity
<Vordox> And some freedom is fecked up =P
<Sylandest> TrixieBaconMuffin: whats the matter? *hugs*
<Ninjazz> I'll pm you it, derpy_pony. It's kinda inappropriate. :$
<derpy_pony> haha, thx :)
<TrixieBaconMuffin> i diced onions
<Airpuff> Vordox: and what one conciders fucked up is diffrent from person to person.. :s
<Sylandest> TrixieBaconMuffin: haha :D
<Phase4> 00,02RAGE
<Phase4> 00,02everything breaks on me
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Airpuff> Phase4: whats up?
<Vordox> Airpuff: As AJ said. "Eeeyuup"
*Ninjazz hugs Phase4
<Airpuff> Vordox: AJ says "Eeeyuup"? :s
<Airpuff> Vordox: only remember Big mac' sayin that
<Vordox> Airpuff: Season 2, CMC doing the Gabby Gums part
<Vordox> Where Mac got angry and AJ
<Avis-Esk> asdf
<Airpuff> Vordox: Aaah! now i remember it! :D
<Avis-Esk> HI L_L
<Vordox> You all want to know something fun?
<Vordox> Something most people haven't noticed
<[iPad]JRP2234> Fuck u Telstra
<Vordox> Bonbon and Lyra MAY be great friends in the MLP show.
<[iPad]JRP2234> Just fuck off please
<Vordox> Sure it's a speculatio but...
<[iPad]JRP2234> Ugh I'm so mad
<Ninjazz> Indeed, Vordox. That ticks me off too.
<Ninjazz> Just because they are in the same scene together doesn't make them lovers.
<Ninjazz> I mean... sure.
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas <--- Look here, at 2:17
<Ninjazz> Shipping.
<Vordox> LOOK AT IT!
<Ninjazz> I WANT ALL OF YOU TO LOOK AT IT!!!!
<Vordox> Anyway, enough analyzing the MLP...
<Vordox> Back to spriting and ignore the world some more. :P
<Phase4> 00,02stupid modem
*Phase4 00,02grumble grumble grumble
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Saw it? :P
<Yankee> saw what?
<Airpuff> Phase4: did you ever try to turn it off an on? :D
<Phase4> 00,02Airpuff, i did
<Phase4> 00,02did bugger all
<Ninjazz> Yes, I did.
<Vordox> Yankee: The 2:16-17 of that Video
<Airpuff> Phase4: :D
<Vordox> Same sync, same animation, same emotion.
<Ninjazz> They were hopping together.
<Vordox> You sure anyone could do that? :p
<Twi_Fi> Goodnight everypony!
<Phase4> 00,02either the modem is dying or internode were doing maintinance, which is likely considering the time
<Vordox> Eeeyup Ninjazz
<Phase4> 00,02night Twi_Fi
<|Discord|> Night Twi_Fi
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Twi_Fi! Take care!
<Ninjazz> But what does that mean? :S
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Would you walk in sync with random strangers? :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Night Twi_Fi
<Alexx> Twi_Fi: may the force be with you
<Airpuff> Night Twi_Fi :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ok now im back anything interesting tha i should know when im gone
<CrazyCherry> G'night Twi_Fi!!!
<Ninjazz> Nope. But this is Pinkie Pie doing a parade here.:D
<dishwasher_EXTREME> where?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: True, but coincidence? Don't think si
<Vordox> So
<Vordox> It's TOO specific to be "Coincidence"
<Ninjazz> The team have stated that they were put together cause the look good together.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> weird
<Barbetos|AtWork> Isn't that still a matter of opinion?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> I love !!! LOVE !!! moist towelettes
<Vordox> Ninjazz: See? :P
<dishwasher_EXTREME> they feel so GLORIOUS upon my sweet ass
<Airpuff> dishwasher_EXTREME: ... wat.. :D
<Sylandest> I have returned with cereal, everypony. Whats going on now?
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Airpuff> Sylandest: Wb :)
<Sylandest> Airpuff: tyty :)
<dishwasher_EXTREME> Sylandest moist towlettes
<Kammerjunk> :why:
<Sylandest> dishwasher_EXTREME: and how much you enjoy them upon your allegedly sweet ass? :D
<Vordox> Ninjazz: And you think that's the ONLY time they had a "Involvement" with eachother?
<Ninjazz> But that's just how ANY fandom works, Vordox. As much as I hate crack pairing, this one has certain potential even if it just that. :S
<Vordox> Just a sec.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> they make me feel clean
<Vordox> 17:25 - fighting with Lyra over Smarty Pants, <--
<Vordox> 07:13 - Seen talking to Lyra by the well as Spike walks passed them. She and Lyra are then startled by Derpy.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ?

<Sylandest> Airpuff: and also singing aloud since I have the house to myself, lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> dishwasher_EXTREME I already cheated on you with another spoon.

<pony_996> did you ever see gabriel iglasias?
<pony_996> hes funny and hes on netflix
<Shimmer> Wrek|Dusty: Love and tolerate
<RyunosukeKnT> at first I seen stockings.. I was like, not bad, then found out it was Eddie Izzard :(
<alexxm> Kandarihu what don't you like about him
<Lambo> Wrek|Dusty: Well, I pressed on the pause button thingy when I loaded this site. And I am one of those people who has got hundreds of tabs open... Well, nevermind
<Wrek|Dusty> 05Shimmer: seeing how often he complains, he's had enough tolerance
<StefOfAllPonies> I can't understand a word he's saying.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can
<BronyJenkins> Yes you can.
<Very_Silly_Filly> umad
<Straisin> finally, no more buffering :D
<StefOfAllPonies> Yeah you're right, I can.
<Lambo> Is he wearing that all the time?
<Straisin> lol
<Straisin> eeyyyyy
<Kandarihu> All of this just darkens the atmophere around here. I'm not hating on him personally. The guy's confused and he's been taught to take pride in that.
<pony_996> he looks gay
<Sylandest1> good afternoon, im a bit of a bastard
<Sylandest1> XD
<pyrocatboy> I'm a bastard.
<StefOfAllPonies> This guy's funny.
<Wrek|Dusty> 05pony_653: as do you but we aint complaining
<Straisin> pony_996: you spelled sexy wrong
<pony_996> wat?
<Lambo> Eversince I knew Louis CK I found all other comedians not funny
<Lambo> "Ey" is he canadian?
<StefOfAllPonies> What's wrong with being gay pony_996?
<Shimmer> Kandarihu: Since when was it wrong taking pride in who you are? Imo people can learn something from the guy
<Straisin> *Eh
<pony_996> nothing
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lambo: Anything wrong with saying hello, eh?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dammit, I meant et
<pony_996> canadian eh?
<Very_Silly_Filly> GAHH. Can't type today
<BronyJenkins> :I
<Kandarihu> Is it wrong to be proud of being addicted to drugs?
<pony_996> no
<Lambo> Ah, well, don't find him funny. Back to Photoshop
<Sylandest1> rofl, altar boy
<pony_996> never say never... to drugs
<Kandarihu> Okay. Sounds like you aren't being serious.
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you are British, you will most likely find this funny, because it's all true ^_^
<Sylandest1> Wrek|Dusty: this is brilliant, ty so much
<Iron_Edge> -lol- jesus disc :D
<StefOfAllPonies> I am British :P
<Straisin> proud of doing drugs? I guess not, but proud of being addicted to drugs might just help fuel your addiction, just my two cents Kandarihu
<StefOfAllPonies> And this is funny :P
<pony_996> ot funny
<Sylandest1> Iron_Edge: I now want a jesus disc
<pony_996> not*
<Wrek|Dusty> 05Kandarihu: just stop thinking that your view on things is the only right one.
<FillyFlam> Blasphayouuuuu~

<StefOfAllPonies> Flam, Flem, Flim, Flom and Flum.
<StefOfAllPonies> Brothers.
<Shimmer> Kandarihu: If someone for some reason is proud of their drug abuse, let them be proud of it? Does it ruin your life when others are proud of themselves or what they do?
<Kandarihu> Wrek|Dusty: could you please stop thinking that my view on things is taboo?
<Wrek|Dusty> 05atleast I am not acting like my view is the only one.
<alexxm> my mum was whinging at me about something i miss much
<SirGanjalf> This sketch is dog's bollocks (amidoinitrite?)
<Kandarihu> All I said is that I wasn't going to watch. You could've left it at that, and we wouldn't be getting into this fight.
<StefOfAllPonies> Well actually, it depends what drugs, it could mean medicine or psycedelic drugs.
<Iron_Edge> SirGanjalf: :D
<Sylandest1> SirGanjalf: i see what u did there
<Sylandest1> alexxm: oh?
<pony_996> HA!
<Shimmer> Kandarihu: You could've left "I'm not gonna watch" part out. What's your point?
<alexxm> hey Sylandest1 hows your day been
<Wrek|Dusty> 05You said he was confused. that sentence implies you know that he is. in fact. why is he confused? what causes you to think he's confused?
<pony_996> WAT!?

<|Discord|> Wrek: Get some for me plase?
<Ninjazz> Magical_pablez94: I still don't see how you could think I am Meanwhile... :D

<Airpuff> Magical_pablez94: something wrong?
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> there's no suspense here, is there?
<AlienEd27> if aliens like these come to earth, we'd better have motionscanners and some guns with real firepower

<Irish_Pony> Ninjazz: When?
<Om> I tried to play deadspace one. I got killed to much xD
<Woodenshy|Facebook_a> Wrek: The game's better.
<Bronysith> is there a dead space mlp cross over fanfic?

<CK|Bed> Those guys look really really similar.

<Ninjazz> Irish_Pony: "OH FUCK SHE SAID FUCK"
<Obsidian> Bronysith: More than likely
<Ninjazz> There.
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> So where is Issac's girfriend?
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: i just fucking said it

<Bronysith> Neo-Changling-Ridley: yes
<LoGaN> excuse me wrek just out of curiosity are you going to play dead space aftermath after this?
<MysteryGuitarDash> Stop fucking saying fuck!
<DitzyHooves> after Celestia banished her sister I'm guessing she had to rest (like King Arthur)
<Obsidian> Neo-Changling-Ridley: WHo?
<junh1024-XD> yeah,. can't think of anything atm
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats a lot of tologists.
<Ninjazz> Bronysith, Irish_Pony: I apologize. I'm getting sleep deprived again. :S

<Irish_Pony> Oh hey its Meanwhile
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> I don't remember her name all i know is she was Issac's girlfriend
*StefOfAllPonies is waiting for a Hunger Games Game.
<junh1024-XD> most i can think of is volatile 1-use things in medical or w/e
<DitzyHooves> leaving the pony races to rule themselves ...... it didn't work
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: For a reason? :P
<Wrek> 05Cypresswolf: its no series
<Wrek> 05its a movie
<Ninjazz> alexxm: This ins't a show this is a movie based aoff a game called Dead Space.
<Obsidian> Cypresswolf: Its not a series is a short film
<drfsupercenter> 03clothes? :P
<Om> the secret of death
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I HAVE
<Wrek> 05Obsidian: wrong

<Bronysith> Ninjazz: good game play... not scary
<Angel_Umbreon> 13a "choco stick" apparently
<Wrek> 05its a long movie
<DitzyHooves> and they evacuated to the cave (where Canterlot was built)
<red_ony> well 75 min are hardly a movie :P
<Ninjazz> Bronysith: Agreed.
<Cypresswolf> :O Boy am I out of the loop!
<MysteryGuitarDash> Obsidian: How short
<Obsidian> Okay maybe no short
<Angel_Umbreon> 13like a chocolate ice lolly but smaller
<Angel_Umbreon> 13but calling it a choco stick feels weird
<drfsupercenter> 03also FFS< these screen protectors are fairly bad once they've been on my DSi XL for a while
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: not talking about the lame ass movie. talking about the excellent book
<drfsupercenter> 03it started ripping the screen LOL
<Irish_Pony> Wrek: Why is it that this movie isnt as popular as when it first came out?
<LoGaN> excuse me Wrek just out of curiousity will we watch dead space aftermath after this?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Irony~
<Ninjazz> Bronysith: Ooooohhhhh. Still haven't read it. :$
<Wrek> 05probably not
<Airpuff> Douche capt :d
<StefOfAllPonies> Making the movie is easier than making the games?
<Om> What a well kept beard!
<Bronysith> Ninjazz: check it out sometime
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 want some of my choco stick

<Irish_Pony> Where have I heared this guy before????
<Ninjazz> Bronysith: I might. I got a friend who wont stop talking about it.
<Om> Dat voice...
<alexxm> has anyone else seen the brony thing pbs did
<Barbetostologist> Cypresswolf don't feel bad. The only reason I became aware of this movie was becuase my little brother was obsessed with Dead Space after thefirst one came out.
<Om> I know it..
<CK|Bed> Dat finger
*Skylands thinks Pocky
<Angel_Umbreon> 13no thanks, yours doesn't seem all that appetising :B
