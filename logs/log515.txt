It would be a nice touch if we would get to know how some of the mane6 met with each other. All we know right now is that RD and FS knew each other since they ere little and thats it.

WORD OF THE DAY
A Pyrrhic victory (/ˈpɪrɪk/) is a victory with such a devastating cost that it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately lead to defeat. Someone who wins a "Pyrrhic victory" has been victorious in some way; however, the heavy toll and/or the detrimental consequences negates any sense of achievement or profit. There is, therefore, no reason to celebrate.
Vordox: Well, we'll see how true that is when I'm having a slow day then.
GO!!!
KABOOM!
Vordox any idea how that phrase came about
who here is playing this?
ME
alexxm: An old war form 250+ year BC
How they were winning a war but losing
Vordox heavy causlities but wiped out the other side?
alexxm: No, less casualities
See it as 300

Hey....Hitler was a great leader and outstanding public speaker, you show him some respect.
/me throws soul dews all over her
cool, a friend actually linked me this funny hitler-related pic http://cs303913.userapi.com/v303913134/f46/ZK-2HiWxQoo.jpg
Hitler killed Jews.
13I'm breathing into my hand and it's making funny noises and I'm amusing myself with it .w.
:P
Yes he is a bad person, but the man had skills.
The same people who made a map for Black Ops featuring Kennedy and Nixon teaming up with Castro to kill zombies.
Whoa server lag
Hitler was one of the best things that could happen to Germany at that time.
The follow up however...
Well not really
Kennedy was also charismatic, but people complain about him wanting to start Vietnam.
Nazis were only trying to purify the world.
Also, you think the Ab Lincoln vs vampires movie is bad?
Vordox: not really, germans were terrorized as well
If he had not turned against Russia...We all would speak German.
Hitler landed Germany in the shit
Look at the Asylum ripoff of that film instead.
Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies.
well, terrorized is a bad term, i meant oppressed
Asylum. Lol. They make movie mock-ups.
twilight_sprinkle: Opressed or not, he did save the land, but the way he saved it caused a huge rift.
Asylum makes the best worst movies.
i actually have a book called queen victoria demon hunter
Check out the political party and the howabout of the German Economy.
MegaPirahna. :3
Do you know what I want to see? I want to see Lyndon Johnson protrayed as a serial rapist.
going to get some sleep. bye al.
Vordox: you mean before the war?
twilight_sprinkle: Indeed.
bye Alchemist
CriticKitten: so true :3
$10,000 budget is all they need to make a great terrible movie mock-up.
To be honest Vordox, the reason the German economy was so bad was because of the first war
twilight_sprinkle: People were seriously panicing and being opressed. and then hitler came there and took over.
Vordox: well, i dont remember what germanys condition was before the war
snakes on a train, fucking hilarious ^^
So getting Hitler and another war didn't really help
twilight_sprinkle: Pretty shit. :P
Vordox: well, people were still panicking and opressed during hitler
War makes the economy go BOOM.
Aliens v.s. Hunters. WTF.
war also makes people go boom
diddutz: Ha, haven't seen that one, but now I want to run out and hunt it down.
Braviary: DO HO HO
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
DISMISSED!
Braviary: Sad truth, check USA.
It wasn't the war that made Germany weak, it was the treaty that fucked Germany up the ass, to pardon my language.
Well yeah, but that was a direct result of the war
^
RAINBOW!
If they had won the war it wouldn't have happened.
Wait a minute.
the treaty is a result of loss of war, so thats nothing surprising
Braviary: they shouldve never started a war
Vordox: Nonsense. According to Fox News, the economy is totally in the shitter because of Obama! Not because of the two massive wars started prior to his inauguration that are costing us about a trillion dollars per year!
CriticKitten: lol fox news
Imperialism is important for a country's growth.
02Got to go :<
GO!
02Nini everyone~
According to Fox news the UK is turning into the UKKK
Because of racist Nazi babies
Tru fax
according to fox news bronies are babymen
Also, Fox News seems to have trouble creating graphs.
night ray
And they seem to have confused Russia with Greece.
Nazi babies??? :S
Braviary: imperialism isnt a correct way to grow
CriticKitten: And HOW can you still be standing IF the two wars are NOT sponsored by the PResident?
FOX News as a whole isn't that bad, it's just select commentators that everyone makes fun of.
00,10Dont you meen Faux news Dari?
CriticKitten: Cause and reactions
13Goodnight Ray :D
SUMICA
XD
FINALLY!
according to fox news anonymous can blow up trucks
To Skype!
They probably could.
/me sleeps on Angel's Head
hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT hows yoru day been
Weren't Fox News the same people that got all the info wrong about the bronies?
Fox 'News'
And they have trouble figuring out that palm trees don't appear in cities in the east coast....you know what, let's just say Fox News has trouble being factually accurate.
If the truck had a GPS, you could hack the truck, control it, overheat the engine.
alexxm aside from a headache, it's been good, and yours ?
Even if you couldn't explode it, you could crash it.
4chan is more politically correct than Fox News is.
i've been good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
8,6gonna set up for some music requests and be back in just a minute
FOX is closer to the center as a whole than MSNBC.
Since stream's down, this is the clip of evil racist babies
I do enjoy listening to Fox occasionally, though. It's quite amusing.
It's only 1 minute 30
XD
Anyone care for a game of something? I'm bored n lonely. LOVE ME! >_<
Meanwhile: Ikr o__o
FairysHuff: got serious sam 1?
Braviary: Hardly. They're both on the opposite ends of the idiot spectrum.
FairysHuff: like both non HD versions?
killerpony7733: No I'm not much of an fps player
The only difference is that MSNBC is rather sad, and Fox is rather hilarious.
killerpony7733: Slow reactions.
FairysHuff: Oh :D you don't need that with serious sam really
Everyone loves a bit of Russell Howard. :P
14aw, missed him D:
killerpony7733: I prefer trun based strategy or RPGs like IceWind Dale
meh.
Hem
ehm.
Besides, Fox has singlehandedly produced more, and better, memes. Like Megyn Kelly or Bill O'Reilly. :3
FairysHuff: I'm a all round gamer i may not like just a few genres but else i can play most games
http://derpy.me/CZZYx for some reason this picture makes me laugh
alexxm: thats cute
i know killerpony7733
hello bronystate!
Big_Macintosh_1992: Oi
killerpony7733: I loathe racing games. Never understood peoples love of them. Yeh lets go round and round in a circle. WOO! ^_^ heh
I don't get racing in general.
hey Bug_Macintosh_1992 hows your day been
alexxm all I could think was "Hug the Giraffe." followed by "Wow. That sounds like something some one would say to indicate the kind of trip they are on."
People all watch racing for one reason, and one reason only
CriticKitten: Same
Crashes
It's Russell Crow's fightin' tour, fightin' round the wurld.
XD
alexxm: lol... bug mac
FairysHuff: alot of games with that solved how boring it was with guns and stuff
my head hurtsss, and this chat is deaaaaaad :p
alexxm: been good
crashes are too painful to watch for me personally o.o
14anyway, I'm going to bed too
I have a very Jeff Dunham approach to racing: "Oh they're making a left turn!" "Oh they're making another left turn!" "Oh they're making another left turn!" "I wonder what'll happen next!"
lol
But then again I feel the same about any team sport.
Big_Macintosh_1992 i derped
14tomorrow I will be missing most of the day
hai hai
14good night everyone :3
alexxm: 's ok
._.
I dunno, F1 has some pretty good crashes
the way i see it you play one racing game you've played them all
Oh dat RD image
suddenly rd and music
hey derp_derp hows your day been
"Oh the ball is going down the field, now it's going up, no down, no up." for a freaking hour. >_<
WELCOME to the Circus of Values! Ah hahahahaha!!! >:D
Hiya everypony :)

Good, good :)
How do you change your nickname again?

kirzstryfe: How about some instrumental music relaxing.
CriticKitten: They are all the same to me.
Thank...... The 11th doctor is real!
8,6this chat is always dead :p
nice luna remix
god i forgot what this song was called
nvm
They played for 2 minutes, then stopped for 5 minutes to comment on the 2 minutes.
discord metal remix?
Then played for 2 minutes again.
/me sings along to discord
XD
Hm, let's see if I can draw Nittany out of hiding. EA IS THE BEST COMPANY EVER.
hey kirzstryfe what is the name of this song/mix ?
Using the ponychat while in school
It's kind of annoying to be honest.
Still not yet caught yet
0,5MURRIKA
Rugby has a lot more action IMO
Dari: Probably watching the last few minutes of the game, then. Those are really slow.
its very easy to bring nittany out of hiding
Brony_With_Pride: high school?
8,6this is the Brony Metal Medley
I dunno, I think it was some superbowl thing.
The earlier portions of the game are usually a bit better paced.
i think this is metal remixes of a bunch of pony songs
kirzstryfe: fuck yeah, metal ponies!
8,6brony metal medley, from bronyfied
But near the end, they take HUGE pauses between each play because everyone's trying to drag out the remaining clock time.
woop
8,6just realized how low my sound was
Jim: nice simple name
kirzstyfe
kk thanks :p
woops
Why be complex when you can be easy
wait, that came out wrong
Or the world could stop playing team sports and paying players millions to kick a ball and actually contribute to society. But thats my opinion.
lol
Jim: haha
FairysHuff: or give them a bit less money at least :D
FairysHuff, I never thought about that. Lol.
MadSurge: If anything the should be payed minimum wage at most.
*they
MadSurge: but if you pay them less, they all quit and you end up with FairysHuff's idea

Invi: I think his voice was a little shakey, or rather worn down, but he was well up for it. As we were for him. :D
twilight_sprinkle: the joke is that he "ships with everything" so mailing is a joke. Im no telling where i got the picture
delicous book

And now more adorable Luna.

Ponies47 I watched one video, but it led to another. Soon, I had spent the day watching countless pony YTP's and PMV's. I enjoyed it very much, and I had witnessed many flame wars in the comments between bronys and antibronys. I looked up what brony ment, and decided to take for myself, the name of the brony.
Molestia eyeing her next prey.
FairysHuff: NO
I'm going to bed you guys. Night, and dance for me too!

Nyria: .. i thought i was free of this song.. i finally managed to stop listening.. and then.. stream.. xD

Invi: It was hilarous. This plane came overhead the moment he finished talking to us. So he swore at it and began playing really loud. We all applauded. :D
Airpuff: hehe~
otakon: I knew that comment would get a reaction from someone ^_^
kirzstryfe: can I post a link ?

Ponies47 I then went to my Junior high school the next day, and announced to my classroom that I was a brony. There was mass confusion, so I explained. Many people immedielty called me gay, wich is neutral to me, cause' im bi. So anyway, I still get in wars with my frinds every now and again about the show, but we have our relationships. They are shaky, but they exist.
GilDash: Oh well then. Sorry :$

FF6 is awesome because Kefka was such a fun villain.
snowballs in summer? sure, why not
My memeries of roblox are back.

FF6 is the best FF simply because it's the only one that doesn't bore me to tears

speaking of Scootaloo: http://scootaloo.com/
Nittany_Discord: good morning
You grow to loathe Kefka because he's a villain who -loves- being a villain. He is evil because he is insane, and everyone around him knows it.
Brony music vifeos
twilight_sprinkle: Correct, but it's also a miracle, because ALL Turn-based JRPGs put me to sleep.
Hey, everybrony!
And the longer you interact with him int he game, the more horrible evil things he does.

Today, HotShot, the caption wouldn't be that different :S
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TEXTWALL: Many people think the Woody's Roundup sequence was filmed with real puppets. But really they took the same CG models and made small changes to make them look like puppets. Then they animated the puppet versions of the characters in a CG black-and-white set. Then they used this technique called the kinescope effect, which adds scratches, hairs, and pieces of grain
1,11to the image to make it look old.
sugar frosted? dipped in chocolate? must be pinkie espiramentin again

who voiced the dog in pat 3
1,11RANDOM BARBIE TRIVIA: Early drafts of the original Toy Story had a Barbie doll in the role that became Little Bo Peep, but Mattel refused to license the character to Disney. The huge popularity of the movie (and boost in sales for Mr. Potato Head and other featured toys) led them to agree to have Tour Guide Barbie included in this film. Naturally, Mattel released Tour Guide Barbie as
1,11an exclusive doll to tie in with the film.
cha-ching :)
This cracks me up xD

SPACEBALLS
THE BALLS ARENT INERT
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene with Rex in the car in Al's Toy Barn holding the How to Defeat Zurg book, at 45:17 into the movie, there is one frame where we see a clear glimpse of the bottom corner of the book. As a lighthearted jab at Canadians the cover price is shown as $4.95 and $50.00 in Canada. It should be about $6.95.
Noooooooooo

ESE ESPAÑOL
desertman2: one does not simply get another guide
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Directly after Rex lands back in the car in Al's Toy Barn, Tour-Guide Barbie quotes "Remain seated please" then repeats it in Spanish. This is a reference to the safety spiel on the Matterhorn at Disneyland. (In the Spanish version of the movie, she repeats it in French.)
Nah, that sounds like the right price HotShot...
HotShot: Poor Canadians
I still hate this scene. Damn claustrophobia.
cool HotShot I didn't notice that!
1995
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tour Guide Barbie mentions that "Back in 1995 short-sighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand". This is both an in-joke and a fact: When the original Toy Story was released, toy sellers did not think the movie would be a hit and they indeed did not order enough dolls to keep up with demand. The joke is also a self-deprecating dig at Mattel Toys,
1,11which denied use of the Barbie character in the first film, thinking it would be a flop.
IowaBrony: ikr

1,11At the time of production, Pixar Animation was in the midst of a 5-picture deal with Disney.

1,11counted as its own entity since the original agreement specified five original films, not sequels. Consequently, production on the final two movies of the initial deal,Finding Nemo and The Incredibles was delayed.

ok
We shall stay!
1,11Lasseter assumed it would be counted as part of Pixar's 5-picture contract, but Eisner refused, forcing a tense renegotiation between the two studios. It also led to Pixar's refusal to renew it's distribution contract with Disney, though Disney eventually bought Pixar Studios and integrated its creative staff into studio management. When producers saw the first results of the considerably
1,11lower-budget direct-to-DVD production they were dissatisfied and gave the project back to the makers of the original for a cinematic release.
