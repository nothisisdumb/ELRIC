<otakon> no
<Dermathil> Slowtakon as usual
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I do feel he WAS trying. It was awful and he's completely inept at it, but he WAS trying. It's like watching a mentally challenged, paralyzed kitten try to walk up stairs.
<Planet6> dat superfilly
<StinkomanFan> Trying to be a serious stallion than he's allowed to be
<Darf14> you missed voting otakon
<otakon> SLOWKING! otakon
<Dashie> can't be asked to vote, just going to bop to this smexy voting music instead
<TopHat> fell asleep before poni episode, just woke up now...
<Ictiv> hey, while I doubt Young would do good for a real name, Randomnerd's got somethign going. If he's an outsider in Equestria, he might go by a nickname
<otakon> BULLSHIT!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sits on otakon
*[wub]ehren throws a pokéball at slowtakon
<otakon> that was only 4 messages!
<Combustiblelemons> I'll save you otakon!
<Yahooz> Slow otakon? ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy kkaaaaaaaaaahm
<CriticKitten> If you care, you don't botch major scenes. If you care, you provide true development and don't slap exposition over your scenes. If you care, YOU PRONOUNCE THE LEAD CHARACTER'S NAME PROPERLY.
<Yellowquiet> ONE QUESTION: whats the name of that smooth song??
<ekips> welcome back TopHat :)
<Phase4> B movie that isnt horible but isnt exceptionaly good either: "That Darned Cat"
*Combustiblelemons pushes nittany off otakon
<StinkomanFan> Well, it's a conversion Bureau fic so...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<otakon> CriticKitten: you talking about TLA movie?
<Randomnerd> Yeah, I keep thinking of Spaghetti Western Names, lol
<Nyria> Yahooz: ohhhhhh tatatatatatatatatatat KHannnnnnnnn
<Yahooz> X32 Ftw /) if you agree
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't make me spank yo.
<Ictiv> oooh!
<Iweywrt> Do you have waterworld?
<CriticKitten> otakon: Yep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*you
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: trying for Derpy's job.
<LordDerpington> It's "Shame" by Evelyn, Yellowquiet
<Combustiblelemons> spank me?
<otakon> ah
<Combustiblelemons> ._.
<Yahooz> Spank him!
<BlueDWarrior> the B-Movie is supposed to be passable filler to take up space until your A-Movie in a double feature
<Yellowquiet> THY ^^
<Randomnerd> The Good, the Bad, and the Derpy.
<Yahooz> HMU Boiz!!!! : D
<Combustiblelemons> listen i'm not into S&M
*DerpyHooves` sits on the chat
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<[wub]ehren> OBJECTION!
<Ictiv> Randomnerd: Bud Spencer > Chuck Norris any day
<BlueDWarrior> if your B-Movie is actually god, well that's bully for you because you got a good movie on the cheap
<[wub]ehren> carry on.
<Yahooz> dat objection
<StinkomanFan> Basically, a guy wanting to be the new Jesse James instead of generic pony no. 37
<Kencolt> Put it simply. M Night Shywhatever was doing what Ed Wood did for years on sheer instinct. Just with a bigger budget.
<hipsterpizza> wtf is up with that pony
<Meanwhile> And then a hole broke in chat.
<Randomnerd> Agreed.
<Anthony> oh shi
*Yellowquiet hugs LordDerpington
<Kavy> Waits for Ponies to come on.
<Ictiv> okay...
<Iweywrt> Do either waterworld or twilight.
<Kavy> Looks like Sonic Rainboom =D
<Jim> Buck Norris
<otakon> Kencolt: true, but TLA was not that good
<BlueDWarrior> Ed Wood also managed to back into some funny movies
<LordDerpington> Don't thank me, Yellowquiet, thank SoundHound. I was curious too.
<Ictiv> Are there any weapons in this world?
<Kavy> Waterworld was good.
*Yahooz plays Sax along to this song
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: it's been established for years taht M. Night lives in a different universe. he honestly thought Lady in the Water and The Happening were brilliant, cerebral movies. The man is an idiot, but he does honestly think he's doing a good job.
*Combustiblelemons pushes nittany back further
<fillyfillyy> back
*Fleur dances and claps
<Ictiv> and what kind if yes?
<Amazon> phase4
<BlueDWarrior> well funny in the fact that they were still bad but were entertaining
<Yellowquiet> ;D
<fillyfillyy> how long was i gon for
<Kavy> But I still voted for Ponies.
<Kavy> =P
<Anthony> we watch the aristocats
*Nittany_Discord 11,01explodes
<otakon> damn
<otakon> it
<BlueDWarrior> Shamalamadingdong doesn't evne get credit for that most of the time
<StinkomanFan> He's going to smuggle a revolver into Equestria
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So, getting the chance to stream has always been of concern at times for those with the ability to stream. After experiencing a number of incidents with this over time, I wanted to help rectify the situation with maybe some rules regarding streaming.
<CriticKitten> Mostly pointing out that Epic Movie probably didn't deserve WMC even though it was trite and thoroughly crap. Dari is right, it was actively trying to be "so bad it's good" and just failed. That's not as bad, to me, as trying to be good and failing THAT badly. >_>
<otakon> I missed VOTING!
<Combustiblelemons> boomer!
<Volmise> Gonna go do dishes and stuff, be back later.
<Yahooz> goddamitvotingbot otakon?
<Saturn> 8,1guys, can i just say: a B movie isn't mean to be bad. if it's so bad it's good, that's cool, but if it's so bad it's horrible, don't vote for it!
<StinkomanFan> And a cowboy hat
<Combustiblelemons> good thing i pushed him back >.>
<Randomnerd> Six Shooter?
<Saturn> 8,1there are tons of great B movies out there
<otakon> indeed

<Ictiv> Crossair?
<arrowtobroknee> planet terror is good B-movie
<otakon> B is for ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02(going to multitask here a bit with streaming BMN and typing out my thoughts, bear with me)
<Yahooz> dat timer
<[wub]ehren> you know how JB's music slowed down x6000 sounds really relaxing? we should watch epic movie slowed down by x6000
<Tovler> Lady in the Water was good exposiion until I realized that that was the movie.
<Dermathil> Finally some people who know what B means.
*Meanwhile sweeps Nittany_Discord into a pile.
<fillyfillyy> kool intermission is bout over den
<Combustiblelemons> B is for batman and robin
<Randomnerd> Trigger.
<Combustiblelemons> i beg for that to be picked.
<RAWRity> [wub]ehren: WE'D DIE.
<Dashie> shaun of the dead is a great B movie :3
<BlueDWarrior> The Terminator (I) was technically a B-Movie
<Randomnerd> Wait, that's the name of the lone ranger's horse...
<fillyfillyy> had to showa :D
<BlueDWarrior> it usually wasn't the feature
<arrowtobroknee> B is Big Mac
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts off Meanwhile
<Kencolt> I still want the original Japanese Godzilla. One of my favorite DVDs.
<BlueDWarrior> but it did absolutely killer
<otakon> YES! Planet Terror is a EXCELLENT example of a great B movie
<Combustiblelemons> shaun of the dead is a/b
<BlueDWarrior> and it made a lot of carrers
<StinkomanFan> No, it's Silver that's his horse
*Meanwhile sneezes.
<Combustiblelemons> seeing as it's a good parody movie
<Dermathil> Dashie: that's a great choice, way better than what most think B is.
<Tovler> only cinephile know about B movies though
<StinkomanFan> And I like that
<Yahooz> Chucky is A right?
<Dermathil> hey Tovler
<otakon> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 we start baning users along with the movie they picked
<Darf14> Little Shop of Horrors (remake) Is a good B movie
<Jim> Yeah, making Epic Movie last 5 days sounds like a brilliant idea
<Shizuka> 13the point of WMC though is that when even the chat can't have fun with it, it's time for it to die </late>
<StinkomanFan> Trigger it is
<otakon> Troll Hunter for B MOVIE!
<Yahooz> XD
<LordDerpington> Plan 9 was probably the funnest B movie I've had on Bronystate.
<Jim> Troll Hunter!
<Jim> yes!
<Tovler> You'd think with Thatguywiththeglasses, people would pick better B movies.
<otakon> I own it
<otakon> it's good
<Saturn> 8,1technically, El Mariachi (one of the greatest films of all time) is considered a B movie
<Tovler> Hey, Dermathil
<Randomnerd> Oh, Trigger was Roy Rogers's Horse
<BlueDWarrior> have you all shown Killer Klowns yet
<ekips> I'd like to see waterworld
<Saturn> 8,1it was shot on a budget of $7000
<Randomnerd> You got it :)
<otakon> hiya Dermathil
<BlueDWarrior> Killer Klowns from Outer Space is so hilariously trite
<BlueDWarrior> it's great
<Nyria> Hey Dermathil ~
<otakon> eeyup
<RAWRity> Tovler: we should just go through all of The Cinema Snob's back log.
<Yellowquiet> Machete is lol
*Dermathil has a potential project that he's currently brainings over.
<Iweywrt> Id put my vote in for killer clowns or waterworld
<JTDrift> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes!
<otakon> RAWRity: eeyup
<Yahooz> Machete you be a great B movie
<Tovler> Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night for B movie.
<Yahooz> *would
<Combustiblelemons> if only movies realized they could spend so little and be so great.
<Anthony> i liked the losers movie
<Meanwhile> Nice music.
<Nyria> Music is nice~
<otakon> suddenly music
<Yahooz> Bow chicka-wow wow
<arrowtobroknee> Bee movie was a good B movie
<ekips> oh, that song
<Combustiblelemons> dodgeball anyone?
<Kencolt> well, Derpinton, Plan Nine is an EPIC B-movie. As opposed to the movie that wasn't shown and never existed and didn't stream.
<otakon> of SAXYNESS!
<hipsterpizza> ME GUSTA
<Saturn> 8,1actually, i vote El Mariachi
<Dashie> I'd vote for killer clowns or Shaun of the dead. Oh and epic win of debating music
<Meanwhile> Goes with the whole shirt but no pants thing you have going on there SB.
<RAWRity> the original Wicker Man is a B movie, and it's considered by many horror fans to be one of the greatest films in the Genre.
<Yahooz> Inb4 Saxy!
<[wub]ehren> RAWRity pfft.. it would only take 200 days
<Combustiblelemons> "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball"

<StinkomanFan> Who's Roy Rodgers?
<klobb> El Mariachi was kind of fun

<Combustiblelemons> the thing is a good horror movie
<Tovler> I haven't seen Cinema Snob in forever.

<Meanwhile> Make Derpy work? Are you nuts?
<Fazana> I dunno
<RAWRity> Irony would be them getting into a car, and punching out the floor so they could gallop.
<Cavy> Perhaps none.
<Dashie> That's what they're trying to say, just explaining the picture
<fluttershyfan158> yo dawg so i heard you like ponys.. so i let ponies chase ponies so you can watch while u watch!
<Cavy> They mighta skipped the movie.
<RaveBrony> dawwwwwwww
<Cavy> Wow..
<derpy_pony> so cute
<Fazana> Someone said it exploded twice
<Iweywrt> Awwwwww
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The first idea, with new departments being setup, communication is going to be key in order to ensure individual projects and such are done in a timely manner. Therefore, I propose to each department that a weekly report is done summarizing what has been done, updated/new time frames for individual projects, etc. Basically, anything noteworthy about projects involved in those departments
<SuperBrony64> 10,2would be recorded to inform other groups and team members. This helps to also keep everything organized and see what needs to be improved on. If you all like the idea, the details can still be discussed.
<pony_8295> derpy made a hole
<Combustiblelemons> ;_;
<Cavy> Hey Placebo.
<arrowtobroknee> no one asks where rarity pinkie are...
<Placebo> Howdy Cavy!
<Cavy> <More my mode.
<Meanwhile> If Derpy were to work Nittany_Discord the damage done would be unrepairable. >_>
<Placebo> Skipped the movie?
<Cavy> Got my name back.
<Cavy> =D
<StinkomanFan> That's the joke
<derpy_pony> no one cares
<Placebo> nice. xD
<RAWRity> >Element of Loyalty
<Cavy> I believe so.
<Placebo> Explains why Ponies are still on..
<RAWRity> >Leaves friends in desert
<Cavy> Yep.
<Fazana> [22:06:58] <kirzstryfe> the movie file exploded twice
<Kencolt> Derpy working... well, if you want to clear out all of POnyville for a total rebuild, well...
<arrowtobroknee> indeed
<Cavy> New one later.
<RAWRity> hell,
<Placebo> Also, Dogpile.
<Dark_Heart> I feel kinda sorry for Rarity. Kinda is the key work here.
<Combustiblelemons> what?
<pony_4680> sappy=tree rainbow dash=tree=fluttershy jk
<RAWRity> >element of loyalty
<derpy_pony> let the vultures take care of them
<Combustiblelemons> oh right
<RawketLawnchair> Oh
<Placebo> Only new if you haven't seen it. xP
<Cavy> We can laugh at people who haven't seen it.
<Dashie> chimmicherry or cherrychonga?
<Dashie> hmmm
<arrowtobroknee> and then rainbow went to hospital
<RAWRity> >Abandons friend's business for cider
<Combustiblelemons> they were going to be ok
<Placebo> Will be GLORIOUS
<Meanwhile> Chimmicherry > cherrychanga.
<Combustiblelemons> hehehe
<Fazana> That reminds me
<fluttershyfan158> and rainbow is gonna be in the hospital next week
<Placebo> It is up in 1080p on youtube, if anyone's interested.
<RawketLawnchair> So, are we going to watch random pony episodes or are we going to watch a movie?
<Yellowquiet> Kill Dash Vol.1
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> My little pony!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sounds good to me.
<ekips> Chimmicherrychanga
<Dashie_Dashie> Suddenly, two episodes later RD is in the hospital.
<Fazana> Rareity never completely destroyed RD
<LordCelestia> 0,5^Perhaps the weekly reports could done in spreadsheets?
<Dashie_Dashie> strange.
<derpy_pony> movie
<Combustiblelemons> and yep
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> LOL
<BlueDWarrior> ikr
<RawketLawnchair> Can't imagine why.
<StinkomanFan> !cd
<Tom> Episode 16 of season 2 "Read It and Weep" airs in 6 days, 16 hours, 37 minutes, 27 seconds (Feb 04 2012 15:00:00 GMT)
<Yellowquiet> lool
<Cavy> Nope.
<Cypresswolf> I think Rarity was just about to say something Unlady like when she held her breath there
<RAWRity> RawketLawnchair: pony eps because Epic Movie was WMCed
<Cavy> But she does go to the Hospital.
<otakon> dat music
<Dark_Heart> That was a good episode.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It's a mystery
<Cavy> Next week.
<derpy_pony> what is wmc?
<Dashie> so close to the new episode...
<otakon> do I hear Eye of the Tiger?
<fluttershyfan158> do the pinkie pie babysitting episode!!
<Freeman> i dont care what we watch
<Fazana> *ololol face*
<derpy_pony> i am here for epic movie
<Ghosties> 04I'm assuming these reports will come from each department?
<ScootaChicken> derpy_pony: Worst Movie Clause
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then both got drunk and woke up married
<RAWRity> derpy_pony: it means the movie was so bad nopony wanted to watch it again
<arrowtobroknee> Happy B-day spike!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Dashie> youtube ftw
<Freeman> i only care if its good
<Ghosties> 04Ah, right
<derpy_pony> legal loopholes -.-
<otakon> derpy_pony: your gonna be disappointed
<Fazana> secret of exess
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I hope not, Derpy_pony
<Ghosties> 04All that blue got to me for a moment
<Fazana> What is this one again?
<Phase4> epic movie was that bad
<Dashie> oh god
<BlueDWarrior> *Starts Kougami Foundation BGM* HAPPY BIRTHDAY
<Sumica> 00,10now you know otakon SB dosent have the eps local
<Fazana> Spikes Bday?
<BlueDWarrior> SUBARASHII
<otakon> dat Sorcerers Apprentice
<derpy_pony> I expected to be disappointed...but not this way
<derpy_pony> fine
<Cavy> Which is this now?
<otakon> Sumica: but YOUTUBE!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The second idea relates to warnings/bans.
<fluttershyfan158> she really likes books
<Kencolt> Worst Movie Clause. In other words, a move so terribad that almost every viewer agrees that it cannot, indeed must not, EVER be eligible for a vote again.
<Ghosties> 04I'm also assuming the reports would go straight to admins?
<Phase4> wait what?
<Combustiblelemons> i'll make my own interwebs if ACTA passes
<otakon> wati
<Jim> Modern Spellcasting is now a classic
<Cypresswolf> Oh....Oh...of course reshelving day.....
<EspyLacopa> I'm reminded of that music number from Sword in the Stone.
<Dashie> This was a good episode, but probably one of my least favourite :I
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Fire stone?
<Cavy> Ah. Got it.
<fillyfillyy> modern spellcasting is classic? how is modern classic?
<Cavy> Spike man.
<RawketLawnchair> A heart container?
<Placebo> Rarity threatens RD, RD eventually ends up in hospital..
<Kencolt> Would that be an accurate descriptionj?
<pony_4680> o this one
<otakon> MODERN Spellcastin is a CLASSIC?
<derpy_pony> then let's watch back to the future 2....everybody likes back to the future
<Night702> y u no breathe fire spike
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Spike's gonna evolve!
<Cavy> Spike MAD.
<Placebo> Conicidence? I think not.
<Phase4> spike the conisure
<ekips> his giggle is so cute in this episode
<Fazana> olol
<Jim> otakon: IKR
<pony_4680> thought it was lesson zero
<Dashie> fire heart contaner stone?
<otakon> you can AGE a ruby?L
<Combustiblelemons> fire stone
<RAWRity> Kencolt: eeyup
<LordDerpington> That's the thing when you name anything "Modern" - it's still got that title a hundred years later.
<BlueDWarrior> Well the Modern Era of literature runs from 1920 to 1947 roughly
<fillyfillyy> yea Y U NO
<fillyfillyy> lol
<Lyra> Zolga was an imposter, also have a nice day everyone :3
<EspyLacopa> otakon: Rock Farm.
<Cavy> I'm going to be on next week at 10.
<BlueDWarrior> everything else is PostModern
<derpy_pony> a dragon can
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They could, but I was also thinking they could be public on the forums in their individual topics.
<arrowtobroknee> spike's birthday is the same day twilight becomes celestia's apprentice
<Cypresswolf> That's the best way! ^_^
<otakon> EspyLacopa: yh
<Cavy> So I can see how that plays out.
<Cavy> =P
<Luna> 07,01public ?!
<BlueDWarrior> so it could have been "Modern" Spellcasting in that sense
<fluttershyfan158> i have a stone like that
<RAWRity> otakon: technically, yes, but concievably it should take centuries, if not millenia, to do so.
<Cavy> Curious to how she gets there 0.0
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> but magic
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, for team members I mean
<Luna> 07,01ahhh
<fluttershyfan158> my mom makes jewlery
<pony_4680> snort snoer
<Placebo> Eeyup. I'm devoting myself to waking up before 9 (on a saturday) for ponies.
<pony_4680> fail
<Cavy> Same.
<pony_4680> :(
<Fazana> Rareity probably lamps her with a potato
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Fire Stone
<Shizuka> 13o/ would be better if all mods can see it, no reason to keep us in the dark about what everyone is doing
<fluttershyfan158> i hate rarity!!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Spike's gonna evolve...
<kirzstryfe> 1,3us-public, not public-public
<Placebo> LOL!
<Sumica> 00,10Fire ruby riped off from g1
<BlueDWarrior> >mfw opening a door using hte inner doorknob while outside
<Placebo> Nice, kira.
<Yellowquiet> :O
<Luna> 07,01^
<Cavy> I'm going to guess she falls or messes up a trick.
<Meanwhile> How tragic for you.
<RAWRity> fluttershyfan158: then GTFO
<Cavy> Something to that affect.
<pony_4680> atleast 20
<Saturn> 8,1wait a minute
<pony_4680> ...
<lulubelle> why would you hate rarity :(
<derpy_pony> today we hate flim and flam
<Cavy> Maybe she's just sick.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Sad for YOU!!!
<Jim> That must evolve an Eevee so quickly!
<BlueDWarrior> Rarity might have a little Rouge the Gem Stealing Bat in her
<Cavy> Never know =P
<Placebo> Idk, man. She's ran into things at like, mach 6 face first
<pony_4680> 20%
<Luna> 07,01okay I would like that... BUT I see a issue... what if nopony keeps their reports updated?
<Yellowquiet> Love and tolerance
<Saturn> 8,1it's spike's birthday, which means it's also the day they all got their cutie marks
<Combustiblelemons> gems are extremely common in equestria
<Cypresswolf> what does a gemstone taste like to a dragon? are they like sweets are to us
<arrowtobroknee> yes it is
<Tovler> ew. Flareon can't even learn Flare Blitz
<Hellspawn> :F
<Placebo> Swagg
<pony_4680> yea
<fillyfillyy> no Spike dont!!
<RAWRity> Saturn: eeyup.
<Jim> Saturn: You're right :o
<Iweywrt> So what is next weeks episode about?
<Kencolt> Well, Rarity can find gems. Rouge has to steal them.
<arrowtobroknee> it can if you use rage glitch
<LordCelestia> 0,5What if someone was assigned with doing reports?
<Fazana> smileyfaise
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Rarity cons Spike out of his present.
<lulubelle> i would stick my horn in rarity
<Placebo> Here comes Spike's Y U NO face.
<fillyfillyy> nooooo
<pony_8421> what a gold digger
<Jim> I didn't think about that
<lulubelle> just saiyan
<Placebo> xD
<ArcherJoe11> Rarity gains another Health Point
<LordCelestia> 0,5In each depy.
<Cavy> Well, when she does the Sonic Rainboom, she breaks the sound barrier, Instantly jumps to Mach 10 at 7000 MPH and Shatters the visible light spectrum.
<Night702> ;)
<LordCelestia> 0,5*dept
<Dashie> get in there son!
<BlueDWarrior> a Gemstone from the way that Spike was talking about it is probably like cheese
<Fazana> Hahaha
<fluttershyfan158> i don't hate her..(rephrase) i just find her annoying..
<Cavy> So, in our worl.
<arrowtobroknee> and then he gets kissed
<Cavy> World*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat Symbolic Gesture ;u;
<Shizuka> 13lesson zero style: report when there is something to report
<Meanwhile> And then he died.
<BlueDWarrior> since he was talkign about aging it over a period of months
<Combustiblelemons> ninjad me archer
<Cavy> You'd be dead.
<Placebo> Eeyup
<Midnight_Tempest> doo dee doo dooooo
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Thanks, Placebo
<Cavy> And THEN she colides.
<derpy_pony> next week, rd collides with education...hillarity will ensue
<Cavy> So.
<Placebo> Starscream vs Rainbowdash, much?
<Combustiblelemons> >element of generosity
<Cavy> That was epic.
<BlueDWarrior> and Cheese is usually aged in terms of months
<Cavy> =D
<Fazana> Unless you were pnkie
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: or, she inadvertantly inspires an act of generosity and is genuinely thankful for the gift.
<Placebo> xD
<Kencolt> OK. As far as Spike is concerned, it's a fair trade.
<Dashie> spike the stalker...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, then admins should check with department leaders and see why they haven't been completed. If they need to be delayed for whatever reason, then it needs to be stated why and when the report will be submitted.
<fillyfillyy> for real
<LordCelestia> 0,5Our weekly letters to the admins. "Dear prince dari..."
<fluttershyfan158> a dragon and a pony...oh god why!!!
<fillyfillyy> never was again!
<Cypresswolf> At least Rarity doesnt use it for a dress design...Generousity!
<Cavy> >Rainbow Dash
<ekips> congratulations spike, you are the new element of generosity
<Combustiblelemons> >seduces spike into giving his prized posessions away
<ArcherJoe11> Combustiblelemons: WooHoo!!
<DeadpoolDash> darn I missed the new episode
<Cavy> >Shatters Visible light spectrum.
<ArcherJoe11> And Twilight proves to be best Mom
<Combustiblelemons> eww
<Jim> DeadpoolDash: It's on YT by now
<Cavy> :D You mad Physics?

*Spectrum is shattered?
<Luna> 07,01or can we move on?
<Cavy> :D You mad Physics?
<arrowtobroknee> portals
<Spectrum> lol
<Placebo> How I met your mother on netflix, Ponies on here... I can't handle this much awesome
<Kencolt> Actually, we haven't shown it yet. They haven't. Not we. They.
<Dashie> thinking with portals
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah, the second idea I had.
<fluttershyfan158> twilight used magic..
<Placebo> Lmao!
<Combustiblelemons> lolwut
<Yellowquiet> wut
<Ghosties> 04If you're suggesting having weekly reports by the departments, then I think it's only fair that the admins go over them accordingly
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Instant Transmission
<RAWRity> Cavy: Rainbow Dash could only to that because she never learned Physics.
<Darf14> lol
<fillyfillyy> Yellowquiet Drony
<BlueDWarrior> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGSX03xzJc4 << The BGM that plays in my head when Spike starts to go full Greeed mode
<Meanwhile> Pinkie is best pony.
<Darf14> Pinkie Broke the 4th wall
<fluttershyfan158> its super effective
<Placebo> Goku ain't got nothin' on pinkie.
<Cavy> I'm awesome haha
<fillyfillyy> yes yes she is
<BlueDWarrior> HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR.... GREEED
<Meanwhile> No video link BlueDWarrior
<Combustiblelemons> lol RD bought him weights
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Not at all
<Ghosties> 04I wouldn't mind having the other departments taking a look for communication, but all of the decisions should ultimately come down to the admins
<BlueDWarrior> Happy Birthday to.... YOU~
<Cypresswolf> Like my dogs when theyre about to get a bath, my cats like water more then the dogs -_-
<Yellowquiet> Fillyfillyy or a pragon
<Placebo> Cavy: No you're not, dude, don't lie.
<LordDerpington> I like to think RD just grabbed something from under her bed and slapped a bow on it.
<derpy_pony> yay
<Darf14> Dumb book
<Dashie> lol
<Cavy> That too RAWRity. None the less, she's still EPIC.

<Ghosties> 04In the case of projects or what have you
<Cavy> Spikey Wikey.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Any decisions will come down to those departments
<Cypresswolf> I never thought of that. Thanks RAWRity
*Phase4 needs a more powerfull computer
<Dashie> I think he likes the box more
<Placebo> Stiffest blanket. ever.
<Ghosties> 04But they need to be run by admins first for clearance
<Meanwhile> Hugs.

<Yellowquiet> Pimp Spike!!!!
<fillyfillyy> lolol %kirzstryfe
<arrowtobroknee> why isn't spike in school?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Can be anything in the report really, but nothing like 'SuperBrony came in and said Hi', has to be of relating to the department and shows what progress has been made that week.
<Placebo> Swagg

<prince-dari> That is seriously freaky.
<fillyfillyy> what a jerk
<Dashie> :(
*Fleur is best hord
<prince-dari> I was considering typing NEVER.

<Dermathil> Spike's got Attention Deficit Disorder...
<LordDerpington> The gangly look really works though.
<Jim> He went to talk to Who, the Doctor that is.
<prince-dari> I'm going to need years of therapy
<arrowtobroknee> broken voice
<SuperBrony64> 10,02While the forums have been an effective way of notifying of bans, it becomes difficult to understand who have broken rules previously and how recent. Therefore, I was thinking we could incorporate a spreadsheet on Google Docs detailing about various users who have been kicked/warned. That way, if someone is seriously trolling the chat and are borderline, we can refer to that doc to see
<SuperBrony64> 10,2if they have been trouble in the past and respond accordingly.
<Combustiblelemons> your balls dropped
<Iweywrt> lol
<Cypresswolf> Busy hands are the devil's playground, Spike!
<fillyfillyy> ^^^lololol
<LordDerpington> Dragonballs.

<fillyfillyy> Z^^^
<Placebo> RAWRity: Can't unsee!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02By breaking the rules in the beginning, I mean those who have been just kicked/warned instead of banned.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm surprised his face didn't teleport to Princess Celestia.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That too, bans can be reported there as well if needed.
<Dermathil> baby ponies!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> LOL
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But in order for it to work, it needs to be constantly updated like the ban list on the forums.
<Darf14> Know about baby ponies? .....err....ok

<BlueDWarrior> Bad Idea, Putting him a room full of stuff
<Tovler> Spike stole my Forever Lazy
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: he's not a flying dragon, obviously

<Shizuka> 13why NOT the derpy costume?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Could, but I would personally prefer Google Docs as it keeps record of who updates the document and when.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Someone call the Power Rangers!
<RaveBrony> They have an air raid siren? xD
<otakon> Shizuka: good point
<Cypresswolf> squished ponies :'( oh the horror
<Yellowquiet> Derpy!
<Meanwhile> Why not is never a good answer.
<BlueDWarrior> Ultraman or the local Super Sentai
<Combustiblelemons> king kong anyone
<Luna> 07,01yea...that's also an option.. although I like gdocs more

<Combustiblelemons> eeeyup
<Yahooz> In this moment on... shipping is now canon!!!!!!!!!

<Pip> right, enough pretenting im Henrietta Lyncast, and while this has been fun, its time for me to go
<Placebo> Wonder how many people slammed their face against the screen for dat kiss.
<RaveBrony> dat Rarity kiss!
<LordDerpington> It's how Spike remembered it.
<Darf14> What a twist!!
<DatEpicVoice> eeyup~

<RAWRity> Placebo: just you...

<prince-dari> What, googledocs can be synced to a text file on my PC?
<RaveBrony> The music is so... Random O.o

<BlueDWarrior> *plush toy
<Combustiblelemons> XD
<Kencolt> Pinkie is kind of off her game in this ep.
<Shizuka> 13o/ point of concern, to my knowledge you can't have two dropboxes on the same system, and i heavily use it already
<StinkomanFan> :O
<prince-dari> I don't need to use sockets or anything for this.
<RaveBrony> Daaawww
<Combustiblelemons> well they are 2 entire different species

<BlueDWarrior> Pinkie Pie probably does consume an insane amount of calories to keep a normal figure
<Anthony> ps3?
<RAWRity> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE!
<Yellowquiet> I go See ya Tomorrow Bronystate
<BlueDWarrior> yet bounce around like a pinball everywhere
<Cypresswolf> All we need now are references to pony weight to learn about how pegasi can fly
<Meanwhile> Bye Yellowquiet
*Yellowquiet hugs everyone
<Placebo> Hell, I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but I'd jump up on stage n sing that.
<LordDerpington> Bye Yellowquiet
<RaveBrony> I feel you Fluttershy...
<fluttershyfan158> all bronys rise in honor of lauren faust our fearless leader..
<RaveBrony> ^
<arrowtobroknee> flutteshy is best decoration
*Dashie rises
<otakon> BlueDWarrior: Pinkies metabolism is dragon like,
<Combustiblelemons> i had 2 lines in a school play as a kid
<Fazana> I would sing the ineternet song on stage :3
<Combustiblelemons> i got them mixed up :/
<OneTrickPony> tradition!!!!
<Anthony> ALL HAIL LAUREN
<DatEpicVoice> oooh rarity
<Cavy> So..
<Combustiblelemons> I facepalmed
<DatEpicVoice> you are not helping
*Dashie hails
<Placebo> to much blush!
<Cavy> Is Equestria the World or the Country?
<RaveBrony> That silver pegasus had a rainbow for a cutie mark O.o
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright
<Kencolt> Rarity ain't heelping.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Good question, actually
<Placebo> Lauren Faust said she thought of it as a Country on her DA page.
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: clearly he's RD's father.
<Fazana> Country
<Cypresswolf> thousands of spectators, all looking at you ;)
<DatEpicVoice> Hail Rainbow Dash
<pony_4680> rainbow dash lol
<RaveBrony> :o
<BlueDWarrior> Well it should be D:
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ahh, that explains that then
<RaveBrony> Oh snap, RAWRity, lol
<Cavy> Implying there are other Pony countries, which means Pony armies, which means Pony Wars?
<Placebo> Rainbow dash show.... I'd watch it.
<arrowtobroknee> everypony loves rainbow dash
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> My hair!
<Anthony> WILMA!!!
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't watch The Rainbow Dash show.
<Combustiblelemons> would you watch the rainbow dash show?
<Fazana> There's equestria, unicornia, that rainbow placce
<Cavy> Same Placebo, but you already knew that.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02This one might be self-explanatory, but the idea is making a weekly schedule for the stream outside of main events.
<Dashie> I would
<RaveBrony> :o
<Fazana> All the G3 places
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: same
<RaveBrony> Maybe...
<arrowtobroknee> dat regality
<Combustiblelemons> meh it needs more than just rainbow
<Meanwhile> RD is worst mane 6.
<BlueDWarrior> Dat flowery language
<Yahooz> Spike is best Shakespeare
<fluttershyfan158> without lauren faust there would be no rainbow dash
<Placebo> Well, you have to read into it pretty deep.. But "commander" definitely carries a military background to it
<Midnight_Fire> I would watch the Rainbow Dash Show
<Combustiblelemons> true
<BlueDWarrior> LE GASP
<TrixieMuffin> because Rainbow Dash allways dresses in style
<arrowtobroknee> celestia has only ruled for 1000 years
<Anthony> DU DUN DUNNN
<Cavy> Indeed.
<Kencolt> Spike-- the Shakepearan actor-- oh, wait.
<Fazana> pegasisters
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Very true
<Combustiblelemons> TAKEAGASP! really?
<Cypresswolf> Spike said the H word OOOOO
<RAWRity> and then Spike was Best Puck
<Placebo> And there are different races. Donkey's, zebras, and griffons are all canon so far.
<Cavy> They also confirmed that Tanks and Bullets exist in their world.
<Combustiblelemons> spike is more lke shatner
<Midnight_Fire> There was already a Rainbow Dash before Lauren Faust
<Cavy> So, Army is real.
<Dashie> epic music for the play
<DeadpoolDash> The new episode was neat
<fluttershyfan158> still better than biebers concerts -__-
<Fazana> Blame DC
<Placebo> So there's enough of a chance that I consider fanfics to be plausible.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Wait, tanks in Equestria?!?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Sincwew when?!
<Anthony> LOL
<Placebo> Kira_Pony_Yamato: Tank the turtle? =3
<Cavy> They named the Turtle Tank.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *facekeyboard*
<Dashie> fail
<Cavy> Scratch that.
<Placebo> LMAO!
<Meanwhile> Pegasi and unicorns are self righteous douchebags, who would have guessed.
<NewDCD> 9if I may?
<Cavy> Dashie named it tank.
*Meanwhile twiddles his moustache.
<Yahooz> ...inside a house
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yes, go ahead
<Dashie_Dashie> Winter Storm? BETTER DRINK MY OWN PISS.
<Dashie> tank is beast
<BlueDWarrior> ikr Meanwhile
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Haven't seen that episode.
<Cavy> Yep.
<Meanwhile> Better watch your capslock.
<Cavy> Called "May the Best Pet Win
<Cypresswolf> Surely Unicorns could transmute food through equivalent exchange?
<Cavy> "
<fluttershyfan158> if u could be a pegasus,unicorn,or earth pony what would u rather be?
<Placebo> Unicorns. Control the Sun and moon, can't hold a door against the elements.
*Combustiblelemons strokes his beard
<arrowtobroknee> meanwhile, ate the equestria UN
<Cavy> Oh, and that reminds me:
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It's the only one I've missed thus far, and to be honest, I've been too busy/lazy to look it up
<Cavy> Epic Spike attempt at accent.
<Dashie> yay
<fillyfillyy> earth pony
<Sumica> 00,10Fire, wang fire
<BlueDWarrior> no this the League of Nations
<arrowtobroknee> all in favour of making RD a lesbain
<Combustiblelemons> neigh
<BlueDWarrior> you know, the thing that came before the UN
<pony_4680> pinkie pie...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ponies are too silly.
<arrowtobroknee> raise your hoof
*Yahooz strokes his... dawwww no beard or moustache
<BlueDWarrior> that failed utterly
<fluttershyfan158> nooooooo
<BlueDWarrior> like this summit will
<Meanwhile> arrowtobroknee: I ate the Equestrian UN? -_^
<Kencolt> OK. The earth Ponies invented the Kazoo.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Pegasisisisises
<DeadpoolDash> Wang Fire is best Fire
<Dashie> best government ever
<HeavyMetalDash> Hi everypony!

<Combustiblelemons> harrumph
<pony_8295> No ideas. earth ponys
<pony_8295> its canon
<NewDCD> 9There is a huge problem with the schedule system, and thus, I would like to impart personal experience of my own
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: Private Wang Fire is best Fire Nation Soldier
<SuperBrony64> 10,02There needs to be a MLP RTS game
<OneTrickPony> derp
<arrowtobroknee> commander hurricane is a load of hot air
<Fazana> derp
<BlueDWarrior> YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
<HeavyMetalDash> I luv this episode
<Placebo> 6_9
<fillyfillyy> you mean the last roundup
<BlueDWarrior> I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS INSULT
<DatEpicVoice> Skyrim.. only with ponys
<Cypresswolf> RTS?
<Fazana> nope.avi
<Night702> that was earlyer today
<BlueDWarrior> *snow*
<Combustiblelemons> *plays malcom in the middle themesong*
<brieannar> still
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: I'd play that.
<fillyfillyy> eeyup
<Tovler> You're not the boss of me now! And You're not so big! Life is unfair!
<NewDCD> 9you might or might not remember the Giant Robot Saturday Night event I tried holding back in old BronyState...it was a test for a system like this
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Humans can learn ALOT from ponies...
<brieannar> can you put it on
<arrowtobroknee> the RTS must be have new lunar republic
<BlueDWarrior> Didn't turn out well
<Combustiblelemons> life is unfaaaaiiiiirrrr ^_^
<fillyfillyy> go to youtube and watch it
<BlueDWarrior> it was an utter disaster
<Cavy> Derpy was canon until they actually called her Derpy.
<Meanwhile> Life is unfair. Boohoo.
<fluttershyfan158> i love that song
<Cavy> >Juss saying.
<DeadpoolDash> Real Time Strategy=RTS
<RaveBrony> That horse sound
<Meanwhile> Cry mich ein river.

<Combustiblelemons> fluttershy in that armour = epic win
<pony_4680> lol
<fluttershyfan158> fos ro dah!!!!
<Cavy> Perhaps I'm confusing myself.
<NewDCD> 9my end conclusion was that it was pretty much impossible to hold a schedule, even if it was set for hours I THOUGHT I would be available...
<Yahooz> Wang Fire :3
<fillyfillyy> 1 sec
<Placebo> Eeyup.
<Cavy> Define Canon.
<Cavy> >.>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>turned based RTS pony game
<Dashie_Dashie> MLP: Friendship is MMORPG
<NewDCD> 9in the end there is always the possibility that whomever is in charge is not going to be able to make it
<Dashie_Dashie> lol wut
<Placebo> Canon is proven true by the show.
<Cavy> >Fail attempt to see if I was using it right.
<Fazana> Ask pinkies, she has lots of parptay ones
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> This episode proves that humans can learn ALOT from ponies...

<NewDCD> 9however
<brieannar> tell her or him to put the last roundup on

<RAWRity> Dashie_Dashie: it will be once Equestria Online is done.
*Shizuka 13scribbles in her ideas book
<Placebo> Derpy was actually *fanon*
<Meanwhile> Think inside the chimney.
<arrowtobroknee> I think inside a chimney
<fillyfillyy> can i give brieannar a link to a youtube vid?
<NewDCD> 9there is another thing that can be done, not just exactly a SCHEDULE...
<Yahooz> Somebody fund Fighting is Magic to make it release faster
<Cavy> OHHH
<Cavy> Now I get it.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3huh?

<Yahooz> lol your pinging him wrong XD
<Cavy> I'd assume Fanon would mean it's considered true even though not confirmed?
<NewDCD> 9set certain times every once in a while in which a streamer is ABSOLUTELY SURE can make it...and if they can't, someone else can take over for them
<Placebo> Or you could.. you know... eat that hat..
<BlueDWarrior> We're out of food btw
<brieannar> lol!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3we already played the derpy episode today brieannar
*Jim needs that civ V mod

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Shizuka: Indeed, FUND IT
<LordDerpington> Desktop Ponies has lots of sprite-like graphics.
<Yahooz> ja
<Dashie> We need to gather the top scientists of the world and develop an offline virtual equestria and an online one
<Meanwhile> I could think inside the chimney if I went into the attic, which I could since the hatch is right above my bed. But I'm not going up there, there are things up there.

<Jim> Dashie_Dashie: O U
<Placebo> Basically. It's what the fans are able to deduce from other clues, but isn't exactly "confirmed" in the show.

*LadyCanary waves to everyone.
<arrowtobroknee> *snowball fight*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Next step for ponies: space-age?
<LadyCanary> Fleur!!!! *hugs back*
<RawketLawnchair> Not again.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They are animals with fingers that permanently walk on their hind legs.
<Jim> Of course ScootaChicken ! :)
<Placebo> Well, they have gun-powder
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: that's just weird.
<BlueDWarrior> HATE
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Indeed
<Placebo> and also, presumably, steam locomatives
<Kencolt> It's a bipedal sentient with frequent territoriality issues. It's not tasty. I'm I wolf, I should know.
<BlueDWarrior> Give us more Hate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know, right?
<Fazana> ALRIGHT WE GET IT
<RaveBrony> Get On With It!!!!
<RawketLawnchair> Get on with it!
<Cypresswolf> Spike is best Ham
<RaveBrony> God!
<Fersan> snowtacular!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Yep
<LadyCanary> Yes! GET ON WITH IT
<Fazana> Eeyup
<fluttershyfan158> anyone have a favorite pony..mine is fluttershy!!
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: what's a "finger"
<Dashie> Nittany_Discord Pics or there are no humans
<Placebo> Technology wise, I'd assume their in the mid 1850s.
<Fersan> mine is twilight
<RAWRity> fluttershyfan158: rarity
<Cavy> Nah.
<Combustiblelemons> agreed
*Meanwhile dusts Nittany_Discord's shoulders.
<LordDerpington> It's something you fing with.
<BlueDWarrior> BEGIN ACT 3
<Fazana> They are in 1011
<Combustiblelemons> humans in equestria = jumping the shark imo
<thehated5689> ts uneadedly complicated
<Cavy> Wait, now or in the future?
<Fazana> This is before Celestia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maid Meanwhile is best maid.
<arrowtobroknee> there was a human in the cakes' nursary
<Placebo> They have lights.. those were invented in what, 1830?
<RawketLawnchair> A hurricane.
<Combustiblelemons> I'll abandon fandom if that happens
<Cavy> During Celestia, I'd say 1890
<Fersan> lol
<ArcherJoe11> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/120262?search=commander_Hurricane <----Celestia's birth
<Combustiblelemons> that rhymes :D
<Cavy> Because there is a car kinda thing in the new one.
<Meanwhile> Supermaid63 would probably disagree Nittany_Discord.
<Placebo> @_@ That's being a bit nitpicky, ain't it? Close is close
<RaveBrony> RD drawing a line with a tree, lol
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I think I've seen lights before, but I can't remember off the top of my head
<fluttershyfan158> and another thing..i recently read something called my little dashie..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.justanimal.org/images/human-4.jpg <- Human
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat ping
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> True
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Supermaid will disagree then.
<Cavy> Fair enough, Placebo.
<Fazana> Badum tsh
<Meanwhile> You have that set to ping you SB?
<Fersan> lol
<Placebo> =P
<Yahooz> Whats a human...oh
<RawketLawnchair> A pet rock.
<Fersan> pinkie is best troll
<Cavy> SHE SOILED IT
<BlueDWarrior> OH god they are fighting over a rock
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ferrari will probably be a top auto maker in Equestria
<BlueDWarrior> A BLOODY ROCK
<LadyCanary> Dat SuperBrony64 :3 hihi you~
<BlueDWarrior> what is it with Rairty and rocks anyway
<Placebo> No!
<RAWRity> I love Pinkie's voice when she goes "losers wheepers"
<Fersan> facehoof
<Yahooz> lolwut?
<Placebo> MUSTANGS!
<Placebo> xD
<arrowtobroknee> Tom's grandfather
<fluttershyfan158> i've never cried so hard in my life!!! T_T
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Mustang = Ford
<Cypresswolf> Puddinghead: Say what you will, my side has the exit!
<Dashie> Dear god Nittany_Discord, so there is such a thing
<Jim> arrowtobroknee: Are you a mind reader?
<Placebo> eeyup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Ferrari' logo is a horse, same as the Mustang
<brieannar> :P lol lol lmao
<Fersan> are you a wizard?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So far, we had a schedule doc setup by Fluttershy...but it might be best to use another document for such purposes (if we decide on it). But the idea was to update the schedule and have an idea for what to stream and when throughout the week. We can make this doc available to everyone (even viewers, but only for viewing) and if anyone wishes to stream, they may make note of it at least
<SuperBrony64> 10,0224 hours inadvance. You can only take up a 3 hour block on the schedule. If the designated streamer isn't available after 15 min in the scheduled block of time, the stream is free up for anyone else to take over. We would also include a disclaimer that the stream is not guaranteed and can change without notice.
<Fazana> Ferrari Schmerrari
<Fazana> I prefer McLaren
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai :3
<RawketLawnchair> Scruncy face.
<RaveBrony> So, can Fluttershy fly and not get affected?
<Placebo> It's still a kid's show. Gotta make it easy to see.
<Fersan> sup?
<Placebo> but alas, you are right.
<arrowtobroknee> I might be, or just pinkie pie
<Dashie> who wants a pinkiesicle?
<BlueDWarrior> well... those three aren't full of HATE
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: her wings would freeze
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I prefer BMW, but that's just me
<Dermathil> I'll be back in about 15 minutes
<RawketLawnchair> Windigos.
<BlueDWarrior> GIVE US MORE HATE
<Combustiblelemons> haters!
<Fazana> Honda :)
<RaveBrony> Ah, understood
<arrowtobroknee> dash has a wingboner
<Dermathil> gotta shovel some snow around
<thehated5689> I refuse to believe in the existence of "Humans"
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> NO!

<SuperBrony64> 10,02So yeah, any opinions on it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hmm.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I like it.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Honda = ecenomy car
<arrowtobroknee> we 3 kings of equestria...
<DatEpicVoice> du know.. nightmare night?
<RawketLawnchair> How could this happen.
<Fazana> I like Honda because they are Reliable and preservable
<LadyCanary> As cooold as iiiiice
<fillyfillyy> DatEpicVoice yes yes it was
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It's not good for anything else.
<DatEpicVoice> *dresed
<Combustiblelemons> don't hate!
<Fersan> :D
<Cavy> REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY
<RAWRity> Every time they talk about feeding off hatred, I think of Paw in Suburban Knights. "Feed me your rage forest! Feed me your Rage! Atatatatatatatata"
<Yahooz> Really^12 dislike
<Meanwhile> Fluttershy hates RD. canon.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I prefer a bit of performance
<Tovler> Hatershy
<fluttershyfan158> fus ro dah!!
<Fersan> really really
<thehated5689> i mean, cmon. Hind legs? Hairless bodies? FINGERS? impossible
<RawketLawnchair> Hate is such a strong word.

<Cavy> Reallyx12 Dislike her.
<Yahooz> PWN TIEM

<arrowtobroknee> Fire of riendship
<Placebo> You counted? xP
<Fazana> Also my favourite car is the Dodge Charger
<Tovler> but I love Hate
<Fersan> oh
<fluttercry> 05,15People tend to not read notices like that, so if someone doesn't stream, and it's on the schedule, people might panic
<Night702> umad spirits
<Meanwhile> I hate doctors and lawyers and cops...
<BlueDWarrior> Windigos: Hey what are you doing, you are supposed to hate each other...
<Cypresswolf> Widigoes: Darnit! Now you've got us actin all sappy
<fillyfillyy> but unicorns are best apparently
<Cheshire_Pony> AVATAR STATE Lol
<Meanwhile> And stairs.
<Dashie> haters gona hate
<Combustiblelemons> god mode enabled!
<BlueDWarrior> KEEP HATING
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> YES
<Cavy> Fluttershy hates Rainbow Dash.
*Kencolt looks at his paws. "Not sure about the impossible part there."
<Jim> I like the Doctor
<Placebo> Stickin' with Cessnas.
<arrowtobroknee> Heart piece
<SaxyPretender> 0,14An addendum I'd like to propose if perhaps having a back-up streamer (which could work on a rotating system) ready in case the schedule streamer couldn't make it
<BlueDWarrior> Why aren't you hating
<Cavy> Now Canon.
<Yahooz> HAX!!!!!
<Cavy> =D
<HeavyMetalDash> Freindship saves the world yet again
<RawketLawnchair> How could this happen?
<Placebo> Poor spike.
<DatEpicVoice> YAY friendship
*Tovler has a black shirt that says JERK on it.
<Placebo> C wut i did thar?
<Fersan> unicorns are the aristocracy
<Cavy> HAHA
<fillyfillyy> which BTW is magic
<fluttershyfan158> i like trains...
<Dashie> why is it that even in a story about the past, twilight is thebst mage ever?
<pony_4680> thats 3 times
<Fazana> *facehoof*
<Dashie> *the best
<Placebo> xD
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I don't like the new Charger as much as the calssic
<Cavy> But...
<Fazana> OH GOD
<Ghosties> 04As long as you're not trying to set up some kind of stream schedule
<Fazana> SPIKE YOU PASTA
<BlueDWarrior> Well Friendship is Magic... literally
<Ghosties> 04Because that shit just won't fly
*thehated5689 is hit by train
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dies of melted heart.
<Cavy> Didn't Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy sleep with eachother?
<Fersan> hahaha
<Meanwhile> And they died from melted hearts.
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ....
<pony_4680> fluttershy and rainbow dash just brohoofed
<Dashie> epic brohoof by dashie there
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sounds more like a notification than a set schedule
<Meanwhile> Herdmind Nittany_Discord.
<BlueDWarrior> so the fact that Friendship defeats Hate incarnate would stand to reason
<Fazana> O_e
<Kencolt> Hey-- Clover was the apprentice of StarSwirl. Not going to be incompetent.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> mein gott
<RawketLawnchair> Wahoo.
<Fersan> equestria!
<fillyfillyy> there are no stallions so how was this land populated?
<Cavy> See what I did there?
<Fazana> EE QUES TREE UHH
<fillyfillyy> there are no stallions so how was this land populated?
<Placebo> *SPOILER* *SPOILER* Well, she found her in bed naked...
<RaveBrony> I totally saw that pony_4680 :)
<prince-dari> Meh, sounds overcomplicated.
<RawketLawnchair> What a story mark.
<Freeman> I Like Trains
<arrowtobroknee> all rise for the national anthem
<Dashie> theypredicted celestia and luna on their flag?
<Fersan> and that's how equestria was made!
<RaveBrony> Who wants a brohoof!?!?1 (\
<BlueDWarrior> It's a Creation Myth
<Cavy> Was THAT what that scene was about?
<Fazana> Ponies are almost always naked -_-
*RAWRity loves this song
<DatEpicVoice> ya know
<BlueDWarrior> so you'd use the current flag or whatever
<Luna> 07,01Merry x-mas
<RawketLawnchair> I spy the CMC.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That's the topic right now though. To help give our viewers an idea of when we will stream.
<Placebo> xD
<DatEpicVoice> fluttershy can see the future
<Fleur> ^
<DatEpicVoice> that is how
<Yahooz> AGAIN
<Combustiblelemons> where did celestia and luna come from
<Cavy> That scene always lost me.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> True enough
<Meanwhile> Merry x mas for a month ago.
<Freeman> i spy....
<Placebo> Doesn't make it any less true.
<Cavy> Everyones talking about morning wood and stuff.
<Cavy> So.
<Combustiblelemons> that is the only question left
<Tovler> Merry Malcolm X-mas to you too.
<BlueDWarrior> It's like the Founding of Rome
<RAWRity> DatEpicVoice: nah, Private Pansy can though!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I know a number of people have been asking about what/when stuff streams during the week
<thehated5689> Merry Belated Christmas
<Jim> And merry christmas to all
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Otherwise we might as well just move on if it's not going to happen.
<Freeman> Ponys that are having fun
*Luna cheers
<Kencolt> Faust says that that's meant to be a mystery.
<fluttershyfan158> sounded as real as 300
<Dashie> Ravebrony Brohoof accepted /)
<LordCelestia> 0,5That could attract more viewers...
<Placebo> Christmas lights?
<Sumica> 00,10I realy cant commit to set times unless it's the dead of night
<Placebo> Those are pretty modern..
<fillyfillyy> why cant i see what i typed?
<DatEpicVoice> i didnt remember the name of the char she palyed
<thehated5689> or very, very early Merry Christmas
<DatEpicVoice> lulz
<RaveBrony> :D
<RAWRity> Combustiblelemons: you DON'T wanna know. Trust me. I asked them. Was not a story I wanted to hear.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I was talking about cars...
<Cavy> I never got that scene, it was just them looking down for a second, and then Fluttershy blushing.
<Placebo> Means they have a plastic industry
<kirzstryfe> 1,3maybe set up a feed or twitter to announce when streams start up?
<RaveBrony> Windigo: Rooooaarrr!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> but the subject randomly changed somehow
<Placebo> Which means the drill for petroleum.
<RawketLawnchair> So much for good friends.
<Combustiblelemons> oh ok. i'll take your word for it. :S
<Dashie> the haters are bac D:
<arrowtobroknee> rawr
<Dashie> *Back
<Meanwhile> Windigo's exist.

<Fersan> haters are hating
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hmm, that's not a bad idea ^
<Fazana> Plaestic
<Fersan> nananananna
<RawketLawnchair> Windigos are out there.
<Cavy> Wait.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Where are the drilling rigs?
<BlueDWarrior> Damnit you were supposed to keep hating
<Combustiblelemons> anyways I've gotta get up early tomorrow
<Cavy> That means Gas is coming next?
<DatEpicVoice> and then.. after they finally found peace
<DatEpicVoice> DISCORD

<Freeman> morning?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> we never see any oceans
<thehated5689> not sure if me or not everytime i see it

<Cavy> Which confirms cars.

<Fersan> i watched this ep several times
<Phase4> gnight Meanwhile
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: eeyup
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, the issue is if she's the only one on it and she's not around, then it can't be updated.
<Night702> IT'S SPINES SPIKES EVIL BROTHER
<DatEpicVoice> trixie may be a showoff
<Tovler> This episode is an insult to space bears.
<LadyCanary> Dat moostache.
<thehated5689> romeo 0_0
<Dashie> noooo!
<DatEpicVoice> but she is püretty epic
<Yahooz> daw
<Cavy> Twilight finds Spike attractive.
<pony_4680> aw rats
<Cavy> Canon.
<Fersan> aa aha ah
*Shizuka 13jots down notes, that could be something we make an irc bot do, among other things
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We can't tie the Twitter to a feed?
<BlueDWarrior> Trixie needs to return, with legit magic this time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or use a common account?
<Fersan> italian intro is best intro
<Meanwhile> Trixie needs to get eaten by a bear
<Placebo> His moustache has experienced more than a lesser man's entire body..
<Cavy> Twilight finds Spike attractive.
<Cavy> Canon.
<BlueDWarrior> I do like the fanfics that promote Trixie as a legit Magi
<LadyCanary> An ursa major perhaps?
<BlueDWarrior> instead of a two-bit hustler
<Dashie> actually spike wanted the moustache to woo rarity, hence 'romeo'
<Ghosties> 04Maybe if others would like to use the twitter?
<thehated5689> inb4 trixie and twilight rematch
<HeavyMetalDash> that opening is soo METAL
<DatEpicVoice> yep.. trixie returns as a fully realized mage
*Fleur wonders just how hard Wrek passed out lastnight
<Placebo> Pedolight sparkle?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I wouldn't mind updating the Twitter.
<Meanwhile> But yeah, is late. must bed. you all have fun.
<Saturn> 8,1i'm back
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Do you guys think the Dodge Ram would sell well in Equestria?
<Fazana> Potato
<Fersan> lyra!
<Freeman> Now This Is A Knife!
<arrowtobroknee> math is a talent?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I have a bit I'd like to say about that and things relating to that, but I can wait till general.
<thehated5689> bai meanwhile
<Kencolt> Trixie has capable, decent magic. SHe's just prone to exaggeration... and is unaware of who's got the REAL power.
<Dashie> see ya meanwhile
<Fleur> night Meanwhile
<Cavy> Mai talluntt eez Magikz
<Placebo> Idk. they seem to get around pretty well.
<Fazana> *Insert trixie*

<Cavy> Mai talluntt eez Magikz
<TGAP_Discord> 11,01Watch in awe as I turn this channel 180 degrees!
<ArcherJoe11> A fanfic Idea of mine gives Trixie the ability to COPY Spells.
<Fersan> what does snails' cutie mark means?
<Fersan> cutting ability?
<pony_4680> im watchimg
<Placebo> Dat blush.
<BlueDWarrior> Trixie is Mega Man?
<arrowtobroknee> snails sounds like derpy
<Fleur> Kencolt Trixie's tallent is /tricks/. get it? Trixie. The trick pony.
<DatEpicVoice> AWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<C0DEW0LF> lol somepony's alittle full of herslef
<pony_4680> yawn
<fluttershyfan158> SHOWOFF!!!!
<DatEpicVoice> pppft
<BlueDWarrior> actually Twilight has the canon ability to sufficently analyze magic and reproduce it
<arrowtobroknee> someone told me it was spelt tricksy
<Placebo> How does Seth like this character again?
<DatEpicVoice> she is a show magician.. she is SUPPOSED to show off
<BlueDWarrior> unless it's something stupidly complicated
<DatEpicVoice> or it aint a show
<Jim> Fireworks is now magic
<Luna> 07,01okay shall we move on?
<DeadpoolDash> good old speaking in the 3rd person
<Kencolt> OK... that makes a sort of sense.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Trixie has a lot of fanon
<arrowtobroknee> so does derpy
<thehated5689> best excuse to run away
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> oh god...
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> I just played NUTS ON THE TABLE with my friend
<DatEpicVoice> if oyu go to the circus
<ArcherJoe11> with the difference she is completely unable to LEARN a spell, she simply copies the spell with weaker results. Think of Archer from Fate/Stay Night
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> Jesus Christ, my NUTS, fuck.

<thehated5689> brb guys i need to... umm... Moustache!
<BlueDWarrior> Trixie comes back and learns how to leverage her illusion and show powers and not be a colossal douche at the same time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A floating neon space bear.
<Fersan> what does derpy's cutie mark mean?
<MakerDusk> who doesn't love RD
*Shizuka 13pokes nittany in the side with her horn
<Shizuka> 13poke~
<Fazana> Trixie
<DatEpicVoice> yep she sure is
<Fazana> duh.
<MakerDusk> RD is best pony
<fluttershyfan158> SONIC THE HEDGEHOG VS RAINBOW DASH!!!
*Luna loves Dusky
<Cavy> I think so.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<Cavy> Speaking of which.
<Jim> Isn't Wrek swedish? if so, it's 0:13 am there
<LadyCanary> Shizuka! <3 wub

<Shizuka> 13canary~<3
<VioletVanilla> 06I run the twitter, und am around always to tweet before BMN, though I would not mind somepony having access to it if they really want to update it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka, watch where you put that thing.
<Cavy> You have a favorite, I'm assuming, Placebo?
*Shizuka 13hugs LadyCanary <3
<Cavy> Hiya Luna!
<Fersan> hahaha
<Placebo> Of the mane 6? I dunno.
*LadyCanary hugs Shizuka back
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> anything you can DO
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> can you bake a pie?
*VioletVanilla hugs LadyCanary
<DatEpicVoice> (i can do anything better then you)
<Fazana> Anything you can do, I can do better
<Placebo> I'd narrow it down to RD, FS, or AJ.
<MakerDusk> so Luna, went back to sleep after ponies
<pony_4680> CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
<arrowtobroknee> trixie is now a sideshow for a carnival
<RawketLawnchair> ¬_¬
<Fazana> anything I can do I can do better than you
*LadyCanary hugs VioletVanilla <3
<RawketLawnchair> Oh Trixie.
<thehated5689> :1
<MakerDusk> brought my total sleep up to 19h >_<
<HeavyMetalDash> Be back later everypony gunna watch new episode on big screen now enjoy your Trixie episode she's so great and...uh...powerful kthnxbai
<Cavy> I can do anything better than you*
<RawketLawnchair> Oh, there is a VioletVanilla here? And a Shizuka.
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> wait
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> there's a NO EPISODE
<BlueDWarrior> that's why I like Ponies Reharmonized Trixie, it's a nice peice of fanon that makes it where Trixie is such a self-aggrandizer because he is the middle child out of 5 near-identical fillies and was entirely average at every field of magic
<Shizuka> 13where?
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> HOLY F........UUU
<fluttershyfan158> i hate trixie so much
<RawketLawnchair> The wub has been doubled?
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> NEW EPISODE3
<LadyCanary> See ya HeavyMetalDash!
<Fersan> Fleur i don't think it is an ability
<Cheshire_Pony> NO YOU CAN'T :P
<Cavy> After this, new episode, I'm assuming?
<RawketLawnchair> Ah well.
<Fazana> I can srand up :3
<MakerDusk> right there
<LordCelestia> 0,5I could help out too with that, if really needed.
<Cheshire_Pony> xD
<BlueDWarrior> in other words, she's so incredibly average she has to be self-aggrandizing ot get notices
<SuperBrony64> 10,02(I would like to actually help with that)
<Saturn> 8,1or maybe allow all streamers to update the twitter
<BlueDWarrior> *noticed
<MakerDusk> I would have given her a mustash
<DashWithRainbows> Done...turned out quite well.
<Fleur> Fersan it is when you are that bubbly
<fluttershyfan158> but she's not as bad as Gilda..
<Placebo> Fazana: Wow. You derp'd those lyrics somethin' fierce.
<C0DEW0LF> Trixie annoys me :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ok.
<C0DEW0LF> yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's nice.
<Saturn> 8,1or have a seperate "what we are streaming at the moment" twitter, that also serves as a mini stream backlog
<Fazana> I can't remember the song proberly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Get off of the stage.
<VioletVanilla> 06I had an idea for, when somepony begins streaming, it auto-tweets.
<Placebo> xP
<Shizuka> 13^
<thehated5689> oh ye of little faith
<Fazana> plus I can't type for shizzle tonight
<C0DEW0LF> oooh a flying rope
<Saturn> 8,1i could integrate that into the site no problem too
<Shizuka> 13among other things when someone starts a stream, i'll get to that when it's my turn
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Cars are now canon, as per the new episode, so I assume that Ferrari would be a top-selling automobile in Euestria.
<Fersan> but it isn't good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could do the Twitter.
<Cavy> Guys, shout out when you see Derpy.
<Fazana> STRUT THAT ASS STRUT THAT ASS
<DatEpicVoice> precisely my problem with this
<fluttershyfan158> gilda is worse than this witch
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh, nvm.
<Cavy> YES IT IS, DASHIE
<DatEpicVoice> dash shows off al lthe time
<Placebo> She was in the crowd a minute ago.
<Cavy> RAINBOOM PLOX
<pony_4680> trixie cant do a sonicrain boom
<VioletVanilla> 06Well, everypony calm down, talk details a little later. Keep going with Embeds
<BlueDWarrior> Interior Crocodile Alligator
<Fleur> Gilda makes me want to- *suddenly shuts up as she screaches to a halt*
<LordCelestia> 0,5Several of us want to help the twitter, heheh.
<Fleur> nevermind
<Fersan> it's like your ability is being ugly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> double rainbow
<Placebo> HNNNNNNNGG
<BlueDWarrior> (I drive a Chevrolet Movie Theatre)
<Cavy> <Dat Dash
<Fazana> I saw her
<Fazana> top right of the croud
<Cavy> See what I did there?
<prince-dari> I'm losing my mind.
<C0DEW0LF> she didnt beat rainbow dash! She humiliated her
<prince-dari> Soon I'll be talking to the wallpaper again.
<Placebo> Nnope.
<C0DEW0LF> she didnt do the same thing
<thehated5689> Quick, throw her some cardboard!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02As far as I'm aware, only the techies and admins have access to swap embeds on the site. This can be fine in most cases, but at times, it can be very problematic at those times when none are available. It also makes it difficult for streamers to use their preferred stream embed (mainly between FMLE and LiveStream). What it comes down to is it would be great to allow Ops/Streamers the
<SuperBrony64> 10,2ability to swap embeds with ease. It prevents any problems when admins/tech aren't online and makes streamers happy being able to use either LS or FMLE.
<Cavy> D=
<Fleur> exactly C0DEW0LF. That is all Trixie does
<fluttershyfan158> rainbow dash may be a show off..but she's a likeable show off..trixie is just an idiot!!
<Placebo> :|
<Cheshire_Pony> RARITY :D <3
<C0DEW0LF> i know
<Cavy> Bitch, Please.
<DatEpicVoice> 3rd person
<DatEpicVoice> xD
<DeadpoolDash> Pinkie would break Trixie's magic
<pony_4680> yea brohoof
<Placebo> LMAO!
<Saturn> 8,1actually, i think it's only admins at the moment
<thehated5689> :|
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Fersan> lol
<pony_8295> "But rarity conducts with gace"
<pony_8295> grace*
<Cavy> Madbro.Jpg
*Fleur throws a shoe at Rarity for speaking in 3rd person
<Cheshire_Pony> ; w ;
<Fazana> trollface
<Fersan> buut
<Shizuka> 13but also either saturn or i are going to make a plugin for wordpress to make that easier
<Fersan> she cheats
<Saturn> 8,1sb, this is somethign that'll be different in BS2.0
<DatEpicVoice> ( she just let trixie get the best of her, didnt she? ) :P
<fluttershyfan158> brohoof *gives brohoof to 4680*
<Placebo> Well, I never..
<RawketLawnchair> What, don't like the third person?
<Saturn> 8,1i'm currently workign on a BS admin plugin
<Fazana> carrot top diss in 5 4 3 2 1
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *throws a Ford Excursion at Trixie*
<Saturn> 8,1for stuff like that
<arrowtobroknee> khaki hair?
<Dashie> lol
<Cheshire_Pony> LOL
<RawketLawnchair> Sheesh.
<LadyCanary> Rarity dear, green isnt your color.
<Placebo> T_T
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. It would be nice if more ops had control of the stream.
<fluttershyfan158> carrot top?
<Placebo> Confound these ponies
<prince-dari> On embeds though, I was thinking of making them auto-update when the embed is changed
<Fersan> this is the worst possible thing ever!
<prince-dari> For BS 2.0
<Fazana> umad
<RawketLawnchair> Come at me, sis.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That would be great to have as well
<prince-dari> So you don't have to shout refresh at people.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^
<Placebo> Eeyup.com
<BlueDWarrior> Spike trying to be Twi's hype man
<Fazana> yeppa
<Jim> Call upon the laundry ponies
<Luna> 07,01any other questions?
<RawketLawnchair> I like Trixie.
<MakerDusk> twilight is just a coward
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *shoots Trixie with twin rail guns*
<MakerDusk> even more so than fluttershy
<Fazana> Snails = derp
<DeadpoolDash> trixie do not want
<Cavy> Epic website.
<Cavy> http://www.eeyup.com/
<fluttershyfan158> gilda did teach me a lesson though..
<Placebo> Eeyup
<Placebo> xDD
<Fleur> Fleur thinks that people who speak in 3rd person are arrogant fools. Fleur is speaking in 3rd person to prove a point. Dont think that Fleur thinks she is better than you. Fleur does not think she is better than you.
<RawketLawnchair> Now you see, why didn't they get offended by Snails and his dopy voices and whatnot.
<arrowtobroknee> goodnight guys
<Luna> 07,01none?
<LadyCanary> Oh silly Fleur xD
<Placebo> Best site on the interwebs.
<Fazana> OMG
<Luna> 07,01okay moving on then
<NewDCD> 9,1a viewer once suggested a drop down menu of embed sources as well
<fluttershyfan158> GRIFFONS ARE BUNGHOLES!!!
<Fazana> That is epic
<Jim> oh you
<Cavy> I watched him saying that
<Cavy> Then,
<Jim> good night arrow
<Placebo> What? Do you guys think i just say random things? =/
<Cavy> I read Sweet Apple Massacre.
<NewDCD> 9,1just putting it out there. Go on.
<Placebo> you fool.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *facehoof*
<RawketLawnchair> She says as she tries to enforce the no capslock rules.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That could cause some confusion as to what embed to use.
<thehated5689> bungholes... hehe...
*RawketLawnchair coughs
<Cavy> And I'm like.
<fluttershyfan158> who
<thehated5689> gnight arrowtobroknee
<Saturn> 8,1that could be done by polling the server every, say, 30 seconds; but that means at high load times we'd have, for example, 5,000 requests every 30 seconds, on average
<Cavy> THIS IS SO FUNNY
<DatEpicVoice> ...
<Kencolt> Spike. He should be a lawyer.
<Fazana> I LEIK PUDDING :3
<fluttershyfan158> ok..sry
<fillyfillyy> pudding :P
<Cavy> There are no penises in MLP!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I like pudding. LOL
<Cavy> =D
<DatEpicVoice> sigh... oh spike
<prince-dari> What I was thinking was every minute Saturn.
<Fazana> Or um....other ends
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What?! Why don't they sell fleas?!
<BlueDWarrior> Spike probably has a bunch of law books in the library
<prince-dari> Then having a button on the stream panel
<Placebo> o.o
<Dashie_Dashie> OBJECTION.
<Cavy> That too.
<prince-dari> Saying 'refresh'.
<Saturn> 8,1NewDCD: i'm not a great fan of that idea. it's more hassle to check each embed than it is just to refresh the page
<BlueDWarrior> he is going to be a walking Encyclopedia by the time he reaches Dragon Adolescence
<DatEpicVoice> why are you so oblivious spike?
<DatEpicVoice> ugh
<Placebo> Let's go back to proving random things. LOL
<pony_4680> IDK if u DK
<LadyCanary> Well he has a point.
<BlueDWarrior> (S2E10 not withstanding)
<Fazana> Okay
<thehated5689> they do sell fleas. they just dont advertise thatthey are there
<prince-dari> So when the stream needs refreshing they can press that button.
<Jim> Oh...That's why nobody bought stuff at my flea market...
<Cavy> K
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Agreed
<Randomnerd> Hey all.
<prince-dari> And if they haven't after a minute it will change anyway.
<fillyfillyy> no its not Twi
<Fazana> Door moment = epic
<RawketLawnchair> Door out of no where.
<thehated5689> heyo random
<DatEpicVoice> *points at rainbow dash*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Indeed
<Placebo> We made good progress with the whole cars and natural gas argument..
<fluttershyfan158> nopony jim..nopony..
<Randomnerd> So, we're watching MOAR PWNY?
<Cavy> Yep.
<Cavy> Lets continue.
<Luna> 07,01one can never have ENOUGH ponies
<Fleur> wait, RawketLawnchair. Who used caps?
<Placebo> need moar evidence.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Yes let's
<Cavy> Someone needs to write this down.
<prince-dari> It still means telling them they have to press the refresh button of course, but they don't have to refresh the page.
<Randomnerd> :)
<Kencolt> She can spontaneously create matter. I'm not certain CELESTIA can do that.
*Fleur gets her shoe ready
<Cavy> And put it on EQD or something.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Here comes the space bear.
<RawketLawnchair> My point exactly.
<Fleur> oh wait
<Fazana> Sounds like a car engine
<BlueDWarrior> SPAAAAACE BEAR
<Placebo> I don't have any pape-...wait a minute
*Fleur throws a shoe at BlueDWarrior "No allcaps!"
<Cavy> Stars live in caves?
<Randomnerd> Derpy Boys :)
<BlueDWarrior> Spaaaace
<Fazana> eeyup
<BlueDWarrior> +a
<Fazana> FALCON KICK
<Cavy> Stars live in Caves, Bears must live in the sky.
<Cavy> Canon.
<Fleur> +a?
<thehated5689> quw?
<Placebo> LMAO
<DeadpoolDash> so, Doctor Hooves is in charge of THE Hour Glass
<thehated5689> que?
<Fazana> Falcon kick that rock
<fluttershyfan158> whats rebecca black doing here?
<BlueDWarrior> forgot an 'a' in Spaaaaaace
<thehated5689> o nvm
<Fleur> lol
<Randomnerd> They're a little Derpy, these two.
<RawketLawnchair> I am going to be afraid if Fleur ever gets mod powers.
<prince-dari> 000 isn't very good at telling us how much of the bandwidth limit we're using either.
<fillyfillyy> ursa minor to be exact!
<DashWithRainbows> Fleur Was that the shoe that DCD wears on his head?
<Fleur> No.
<Saturn> 8,1still, during a pony episode, that could mean 100,000 http requests in 20 minutes. i'm not saying that will be a problem, but depending on 000's setup, it could be
<Cavy> Placebo, that came out before I even thought of it.
<Cavy> =D
<prince-dari> If you've used something like 80% they send an email, but you can't find out any other way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twilight. Space bear.
<Placebo> Nice...
<Placebo> Lol
<pony_4680> o.o
<Luna> 07,01that's odd..
<Saturn> 8,1prince-dari: that's somethign i want to bring up in the tech meeting too
<Placebo> Also, Snails is best pony.
<MakerDusk> twilight is so irresponsible... letting a baby dragon out at night all by itself
<Randomnerd> Gah, she never refers to herself in the first person, does she? ;)
<DeadpoolDash> cheese it
<Jim> Space bear. Twilight.
<Fazana> Snails is derpy
<Fleur> This was the shoe that has never been worn so it is still very stiff
<ROHKARA> Trixie's homeless
<Jim> Now they've met
<BlueDWarrior> Space Bear is pissed
*LadyCanary really thinks the design of the usea minor is awesome.
<Cypresswolf> Was that a Jurassic Park Reference? with the trees falling over by an unseen force? Nice!
<LadyCanary> ursa*
<DashWithRainbows> LadyCanary This.
<fillyfillyy> eeyup
<Fleur> I do too LadyCanary
<VioletVanilla> 06c;
<BronyCon> Oh thank god
<prince-dari> We should probably look into a paid host at some point.
*VioletVanilla hugs LadyCanary
<Fleur> ^_^
<DatEpicVoice> ugh
<Cavy> Bears have Cutie Marks on their foreheads.
<BronyCon> the stream is back
<fluttershyfan158> *insert space core joke here*
<DatEpicVoice> they are incredible
<DatEpicVoice> :(
<Fazana> I wanna say it again
<BronyCon> with sexy trixie
<Fazana> HUHUHUH, AYE LAEIK PUDDING!
<thehated5689> i never understood why one would do that
<Cavy> GUYS
<Placebo> Cavy: where ya goin' with that..
<BlueDWarrior> Trixie: I am a Show Magic Unicorn not a Magi Unicorn D:
<ArcherJoe11> Trixie has at least the will to fight the Ursa
<Dashie> lol
<Cavy> We discovered quite a bit in RD chat.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: you know, there's something you should know.
<Cavy> Most recent discovery:
*Fleur glares at Cavy "what?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Space bear: "Nope."
<fillyfillyy> eh
<sonicxsx> i missed it :(
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: and i'm gonna tell you so.
<RawketLawnchair> Oh man. VioletVanilla is winking at us.
<LadyCanary> What is that RAWRity?
<Cavy> Stars live in caves, therefore Bears live in the sky.
<Cavy> Canon/
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: you know what...don't sweat it.
<BronyCon> :$
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well the ursa is almost, if not completely snips and snails fault ._.
<RAWRity> Forget it
<Cavy> Umm..
*LadyCanary tilts head
<Cypresswolf> Trixie: Darriny you two! Im a magic mare, not a Magic mare!
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: enjoy the show.
<Placebo> Derpy made several lightning strikes at once... Derpy > trixie
<RawketLawnchair> That's a bit of a stretch there, Cavy .
<prince-dari> Saturn: If we want to have the auto-refresh for the stream though that means pretty much either setting it to check so infrequently that it pretty much loses its point then
<Cavy> Sorry, stars have cutie marks on their foreheads.
<sonicxsx> I missed the newest episode :(
<Kencolt> Not to be critical-- but those two are MORONS.
<Fazana> ujelly
<thehated5689> did u see the newest ep?
<BlueDWarrior> Space Bear... Hungry
<Jim> Say whaaaa
<prince-dari> -either*
<Fleur> dont feel bad sonicxsx. I did too <3
<prince-dari> XD
<Cavy> Not quite RawketLawnchair.
<fluttershyfan158> i did s well
*Fleur likes Trixie's design but /hates/ her personality
<BronyCon> Space bear
<fillyfillyy> anyone who missed S2E15 thats what youtube is for
<LadyCanary> Look better? When were you better to begin with?
<prince-dari> Because the only people it would refresh for are people who are AFK and haven't seen that they have to press the refresh button in the IRC.
<VioletVanilla> 06ja. .
<Kencolt> I have a DVR and I wasn'r afraid to use it.
<VioletVanilla> 06aber I am ignored X3
<DatEpicVoice> .. love and tolelrate ppl
<Cavy> Ermm...
<DatEpicVoice> she even admits her mistake
<DatEpicVoice> :/
<fluttershyfan158> what would ur cutie mark be if you could have one?
<Fazana> Moooooooooooooo...sick
<Cavy> So stars foreheads are their asses?
<Cavy> I'm not quite sure...

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I think mine would e a Gundam or the BMW logo
<fluttershyfan158> a gun for me
<Cavy> Oh
<Cavy> I got this.
<Fleur> I wont ignore you Vi... But I dont see what you said before that so...
<prince-dari> So many meetings.
<Placebo> Let's see... they have metal and glass.. Which means they somehow mine the earth for ores, and probably have a beach for harvesting sand..
<Shizuka> 13vivi.. vivivivivivi... you are nicht ignored... i love you
<prince-dari> I'm going to need years of therapy.
<Fleur> ^
<LadyCanary> Awwwwwww!!!

<Ghosties> 04What is this place filled with so many meetings~
<Cavy> They say Thank Celestia, and For the love of Celestia.
<BronyCon> BOOOOOOM
<BlueDWarrior> being able to levitate a water tank and milk cows at the same time
<Fazana> Carrot's hair is orange again
<Cavy> So, probably said before, but.
<RawketLawnchair> It's a strech just as much saying "OMG HOURGLASS CUTIE MARK = DR WHO REFERECNE LOLOL'
<Cavy> Celestia is god.
<BronyCon> lol
<RawketLawnchair> I do not like it.
<Cavy> What does that make Luna?
<Fazana> No.
<Fazana> Just chuck testa
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Space bear defeated.
<Dashie> hey, doctor whooves is awesome
<Kencolt> Like I said-- I'm not certain Celestia herself could pull some of this stuff off.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I think I still have some of my bones left in tack...
<RawketLawnchair> Also, hello there, VioletVanilla. You are smart and sexy and we love you.

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Hey, it wasn't allcaps
<Fleur> it was damn close
<RawketLawnchair> I used too, but now she's just sucking jupt to the mods just by going 'herp derp no allcaps'
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm for the ornament.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Mine is a hammer and banana if you need to know. (Totally not a communist or anything)

<Fazana> Implying that;s sucking up? :o
<RawketLawnchair> I have to vent here because she's in the main chat.
<prince-dari> Well the new mod info can be settled later.
<Cavy> I just discovered this as well, Placebo.

<RawketLawnchair> I don't know if it's sucking up or not
<Fazana> Heroic Mc
<Shizuka> 13yep
<RawketLawnchair> It's just annoying, pointless and stupid.
<Fazana> As far as I'm aware, it's not

<Placebo> HNNNNNGGGG
<Shizuka> 13next, still with mods page, shall i reorganize into two sections, one for current/active mods, one for past mods?
*Fleur pulls out a horseshoe and spins it on her finger "that so Kira_Pony_Yamato?"
<Fazana> *Squee*
<Kencolt> Whym thank you, Siniczsu.
<Placebo> Bunny bloom is best pony.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02What's the purpose of the bunny outfits?
<Shizuka> 13sub question, organize current mods into irc and forums?
<Fazana> trollface
<Kencolt> Cannot type tonight.
<Jim> Tradition SB
<RawketLawnchair> You make one word all caps in your sentence and she'll be like ZOMG NO CAPS FOLLOW RULES GAIZ
<LadyCanary> Because APPLE BLOOM in a bunny outfit is so precious <3
<Volmise> It's what the Zap Apples like best.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would.
<fluttershyfan158> look everyone its veruca salt..
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *arms nuclear warhead, while holding a gernade in left hand* Indeed
<Volmise> It makes the apples happy and the jam taste better.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Current from past at least.
<RawketLawnchair> The mods can do that since well, they are the mods.
<Saturn> 8,1(and tech!)
<Fazana> graor

<Fleur> wait... Where do their tails go in that outfit?
<RawketLawnchair> I'll stop venting for now. Enjoy the show.

<fluttershyfan158> the brat?
<Shizuka> 13und techies~
<LordCelestia> 0,5Admins?
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: to provide the HNNNNNGGG attacks.

<Shizuka> 13so we would have Current IRC Mods, Current Forum Mods, Current Techies, Past Mods
<otakon> I'm back
<NewDCD> 9,1I'd say, personally, scratch past mods, divide into IRC and Forums
<Cypresswolf> MMmm...what an experience ^_^ The last of my egg nog, Ponies & Zap apples.
<ROHKARA> I'm just amazed that they can pose like bunnies
<Luna> 07,01^

*Dashie puts SB64 in bunny outfit, commence the HNNNNNGGG attacks
*Fleur blames otakon
<Fazana> I'm scared
<Hydrazine> must be really hard to sit like that
<LordCelestia> 0,5But there are only like 4 forum mods, so it's not very evenly divided.
<prince-dari> Past mods can be mentioned in the history section
<SirSprinkles> 00,06All of the current full OPs will be both IRC and forum.
<Jim> flippedy floo
<Cheshire_Pony> Dr. Whooves ~ :33

<RawketLawnchair> Rainbow Dash is fat.
<ValtheJean> many thanks. I'm curious as to what our intentions are with #BSR and #Lobby, they basically fill the same roles, and as such it's not really necessary to have both
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha.

<otakon> Sweetie was pretty strong in that
<Fazana> Have a convo with Derpy :3
*kirzstryfe noms the elec*bzzt*tric tree
<Cypresswolf> Sweetie Belle get electrocuted by a tree, Applebloom & Scootaloo just stand there and smile
<Ingwaz> what have i missed?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Everybody talks about it freely so it really isn't a regulars room anymore...
<BronyCon> FAMILY SNATCHING DAY
<prince-dari> What?
<Shizuka> 13or poke an oper when we get to syncing flags everywhere else
<BronyCon> IT HAS ARRIVED
<Randomnerd> I heard, "Applebloom said you wanted to sleep with me"
<fluttershyfan158> weekend at bernies 3
<WingedCurse> dat caps
<LordCelestia> 0,5Well the people who visit there are regulars
<fluttercry> 05,15maybe kill it, and make a new secret regulars room
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should we key the room?
<RAWRity> What if messing with the Zap Apple tree, and the subsequent zap, gave Sweetie Belle Horn Rot?
<ScootaChicken> eww Aldershot
<prince-dari> I don't see why
<Dermathil> Now I'm thinking of how Applebloom's voice actor must've had fun doing that part.
<ValtheJean> well, lobby is dead
<pony_4680> where is the shoe?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why key it?
<ValtheJean> so that means we wouldn't NEED to remake a room
<Placebo> How has this portion of the episode not turned into some twisted BigmacxCheerilee ship?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We already have a secret room, it's #lobby
<Shizuka> 13no no, regulars is still very low volume relative to mane chat, especially when it's needed most on movie night
<prince-dari> If you got in there, you've stayed around long enough to be a regular.
<prince-dari> It's fine.
<Randomnerd> ^
<otakon> no idea
<Dashie> watering the sheep, seems legit
<prince-dari> So
<prince-dari> Onwards
<otakon> yeah
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Just make sure not to talk about it freely.

<Jim> I must go, my planet needs me
<Cypresswolf> Give it time, Placebo
<ROHKARA> Cheerilee is a clueless teacher
<Shizuka> 13what shouldn't we do without trying to get a fullop first?
<Sammy> fiddledicks? wut
<otakon> wakes her up
<Kencolt> And there's a lot of tea in Canterlot.
<ScootaChicken> sticks Sammy, sticks
<otakon> Sammy: no, fiddlesticks!
<Placebo> Cypresswolf: I'm sure it's being worked on, somewhere.
<BronyCon> lol?
<prince-dari> ^ dat phrasing
<otakon> dat Sweetie Face!
<Shizuka> 13i know we've been going over a lot of use your judgment, but if there's things we definitely shouldn't do on our own, we need to know
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat DAAAAAAAWABLE Sweetie Belle is just DAAAAW ^_^
<otakon> gods I love it so!
<pony_4680> rainbow
<Sammy> hehe

<Randomnerd> Double Rainbow...
<Placebo> Seems... legit?
<BronyCon> AWWWW YEAHH!
<Hydrazine> rainbow overload
<Cheshire_Pony> Those are some cool apples :P

<pony_4680> triiple rainbow
<Randomnerd> The Rainbow has been Double!
<BronyCon> lol
<Placebo> Over-rainbow.
<Fazana> I want rainbow apples
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Double negatives are the rule in Spanish.
<Shizuka> 13for instance, halfops *can* ban, but i am told we shouldn't
<KernelCobb> RD seal fo approval
<pony_4680> penta rainbow
<otakon> the Aurora Rainbowalis
<prince-dari> Just don't ban anyone without speaking to an op first.
<BronyCon> scootatard
<Randomnerd> What does it *mean*?
<WingedCurse> scootigram
<Cypresswolf> Wait til the valentine episdoe airs, this chat will be going nuts, of that im certain!
<Dashie> Rainbow Dashis actually the cause for the zap apples, but she moves too fast for anyone to realize
<karmatehwolfie> Who uses telegrams anymore?
<Fazana> Bitch slap
<Hydrazine> slap
<VioletVanilla> 06Dont not go get an op if you cant not find one
<BronyCon> ..
<WingedCurse> ...
<Kencolt> Just a lot of rainbows. That's all.
<otakon> karmatehwolfie: the ponies, they don't have phones
<BronyCon> ponies
<Placebo> I know I will.
<pony_4680> ...
<RAWRity> karmatehwolfie: ponies
<Shizuka> 13yfw i understood that fine ^ :P
<Randomnerd> Ponies don't have phones.
<prince-dari> Lawl Vi.
<VioletVanilla> 06c;

<Dashie> fail
<Cypresswolf> fat pony behind DT
<LadyCanary> Dat face.
<Placebo> Ipony. xDD
<Shizuka> 13i'll assume we can always find a fullop on SRS?
<prince-dari> If they're posting R34 like there's not tomorrow or are running a spam bot, and there are no mods around, then you can ban them.
<WingedCurse> dat diamond teirra face
<RAWRity> placebo dial with their tongues!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Noogie noogie noogie
<BronyCon> cloppingtheiphony?
<Randomnerd> Apple Strudel, oy...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:>
<Placebo> RAWRity: That can't be hygenic.
<Ghosties> 04Halfops aren't allowed to ban
<Vinyl> PONIES: The Anthology = Too funny.
<KernelCobb> uncle apple stroodle is best pony
<otakon> dat lederhosen
<Fazana> ololo
<karmatehwolfie> Oh... I SENSE A BAD TWILIGHT SPARKLE SPELL-PHONE PUN.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02le gasp
<Shizuka> 13and then the debate was contested, this is why i bring it up
<Ghosties> 04It was the rule first established when we moved to irc
<Randomnerd> Apple-Sauced.
<RAWRity> Placebo: the bowl with their mouths. Ponies don't give a BUCK about hygeine
<BronyCon> Diamond Tiara= Rich BITCHYwh***?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I want to try a zapapple
*LadyCanary gasp
<LadyCanary> Awwwwww lil Granny Smith <3
<Fazana> I might get an electric shock from it
<Ghosties> 04Halfops can kick, warn, whatever but they cannot ban...typically
<prince-dari> That's what I said.
<Fazana> Electric hurts me like hell :c
<Randomnerd> Canterlot!
<Randomnerd> It's only a model....
*BronyCon 's head explodes
<Ghosties> 04I think for live eps there should be an exemption made
<WingedCurse> apple smith
<RawketLawnchair> Dem braids.
<Dashie> best castle twn ever
<Placebo> RAWRity: Come to think of it, walking around all those hooves all day, then eating with them can't be healthy..
<otakon> Canterlot, it is a silly place
<Dashie> *town
<Ghosties> 04I think for live eps, halfops should be given authority
<RawketLawnchair> Praise the Sun!
<Cypresswolf> selling old seeds - do old seeds still grow?
<BronyCon> MOLESTIA
<otakon> no
<pony_4680> bronycon:twice
<Randomnerd> She was probably called "Baby" Smith at the time.
<Dashie> Wait...just how old is celestia? O.o
<WingedCurse> dat immortality
<prince-dari> If there are no full ops around and someone is spamming R34/running a spambot, half ops can ban.
<KernelCobb> how old is granny smith supposed to be?
<pony_4680> how did i do that?
<Fleur> I love how fighting is magic has an AJ recolor that is Granny's pallet
<Randomnerd> Over 1000 years old.
<Fazana> Uhhh
<RAWRity> Dashie: at least 1000 years
<fillyfillyy> can someone help me?
<Kencolt> WELL over.
<RawketLawnchair> Jealousy.
<Fazana> This is probably like 70 years ago this coolstory
<Jim> dat mighty thanks
<otakon> Dashie: at LEAST 2000 yrs. old
<Ghosties> 04But there's almost always a full op around these days
<[wub]ehren> bro:ken
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Dashie> seems legit
<BronyCon> lol
<prince-dari> That's why it's only if there aren't.
<KernelCobb> so she's probably older than 70
<Dashie_Dashie> No pony should ever pony pony
<Cypresswolf> Does that mean, Granny Smith's parents were *gasp* Flim Flammers?
<Fazana> Most likely
<prince-dari> Not likely
<otakon> Cypresswolf: no
<Randomnerd> Nah.
<LordCelestia> 0,5I assume ops can authorize us to ban, like DCD did that one time for the Vinyl_Scratch guy?
<prince-dari> Could happen though
<Saturn> 8,1i think the rule here is: never try not to get an op if there isn't nothing that needs attending that you can't do without no ratification
<LadyCanary> Huh? o3o
<prince-dari> So just getting the circumstances set up
<ArcherJoe11> Dashie: Not even Close to how old Discord is
<Fazana> Grey hair, quite crippled
<Ghosties> 04It should only be for live eps that they're given the ability to ban
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: eenope
<otakon> and she went AT NIGHT
<[wub]ehren> The Bacon Brothers
<otakon> why?
<Randomnerd> Dat Rarity Break
<KernelCobb> horrible alzheimers
<kirzstryfe> 1,3what's up?
<otakon> man
<Dashie> well I can understand discord being the same age and being able to live for all those years
<Ghosties> 04You guys are halfops for a reason, and not being allowed to ban is a key part of that
<otakon> the music makes this scene
<fillyfillyy> they are RD apples
<Dashie> he was turned into a statue afterall
<otakon> brb
<Ghosties> 04If you're allowed to ban, then why keep halfops around?
<Randomnerd> Get your little pony shotgun!
<BronyCon> lol
<Fazana> Seems legitamate
<RAWRity> otakon: because Granny Smith don't give a buck.
<WingedCurse> great pun
<fillyfillyy> what should i have for dinner...lol irrelivant
<Randomnerd> Granny Get your Gun!
<Dashie_Dashie> Timberwolves... OH THE PUNS
<BronyCon> ORBITAL NUKE INBOUND
<karmatehwolfie> KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<Night702> how about some zapapples
<Luna> 07,01apples!
<Cypresswolf> Granny, light a fire
<prince-dari> [23:47] <prince-dari> If there are no full ops around and someone is spamming R34/running a spambot, half ops can ban.
<prince-dari> I stand by that
<BronyCon> OMFG
<Randomnerd> Get it? Like, "Annie"?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For extra help.
<pony_4680> there wildfire in mlp
<Shizuka> 13i second
<Luna> 07,01applesauce with potatoe wedgies
<VioletVanilla> 06. . Summary. No bans unless absolutely necessary. All other reasons, see OP on page 637 of your manual.
<Ghosties> 04That ruins the whole motive
<NewDCD> 9,1That was basically asking you to be my proxy for that specific banning though, since I had to get going at that moment.
<Fazana> I want apples that grow quicker than lickity split
<Randomnerd> :|
<pony_4680> hmm
<Ghosties> 04We may as well get rid of halfops
*Fleur throws boots at Dashie_Dashie, BronyCon, and karmatehwolfie "No allcaps damnit!"
<RAWRity> Granny's got a gun.
<Luna> 07,01dat manual
<Shizuka> 13if there are no fullops around and we have to take action, our hands are tied otherwise ghosties
<pony_4680> lol
<BronyCon> fine fancy pants
<Dashie> o hai again Fleur
<Dashie_Dashie> I wan't all caps D:
<NewDCD> 9,1Halfops=Interns
<SuperBrony64> 10,02As far as I know, halfops have all the abilities of regular ops minus the ability to kick Ops...right?
<Ghosties> 04Then that's why I'm proposing to get rid of halfops
<ScootaChicken> and then Fleur was Wrek
<VioletVanilla> 06Fleur dear, calm calm. .
<Dashie_Dashie> wasn't*
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Technically speaking I mean
<KernelCobb> maggots
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: and changing modes / topic
<prince-dari> You're making this way bigger than it is Ty.
<Dashie_Dashie> I was half caps.
<Dashie_Dashie> buh dum tsst
*Fleur calms down
<prince-dari> If there are no full ops around.
<VioletVanilla> 06Aber everypony, please do not allcaps. . .
<pony_4680> was to i think
*VioletVanilla hugs Fleur tight
<Fazana> I'm hungry for an apple now :c
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I was half-caps earlier...
<prince-dari> And someone is spamming the chat with R34.
<Ghosties> 04You're taking a key thing of halfops and going "we're gonna act like you can't ban...BUT YOU REALL CAN"
<prince-dari> Are they supposed to do nothing?
*Shizuka 13hugs vivi und fleur~
<karmatehwolfie> Sorry...
*Randomnerd gives RD Salute
<Ghosties> 04Come on
<ArcherJoe11> Silverspoon's face is just awesome here
<BronyCon> aaay!
*VioletVanilla giggles
*Fleur hugs VioletVanilla and Shizuka <3
<ScootaChicken> ohai Vi
<Ghosties> 04Just be done with halfops
<prince-dari> No, come on yourself.
<OneTrickPony> opa!
<Ghosties> 04NO U
<LordCelestia> 0,5o__O

<Dashie> cool story bro
<Fazana> >_<
<pony_4680> clop
<Fazana> arkwarsd sounds
<Ghosties> 04But seriously, that's a major focal point of halfops
<BronyCon> clop?
<Sammy> Dat epic story
<prince-dari> You can't just expect them to sit there and do nothing if no full ops are around.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CLop to the old lady.
<KernelCobb> Their faces = my face when i first watched this
<BronyCon> clop
<Luna> 07,01guys.. we're almost done

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ...
<RaveBrony> clAp!
<RAWRity> DoEs ThIs CoUnT aS hAlF cApS?
<Ghosties> 04Notify an op?
<KernelCobb> :O
<Ghosties> 04Is it that hard to do?
<Luna> 07,01but there's almost ALWAYS an op around
<BronyCon> lol
<Saturn> 8,1can i just say, all bans are seen by admins, and verified, right? so there shouldn't really be any reason for half-ops not being able to ban. if you trust people enough to kick, you should trust them enough to ban, otherwise they wouldn't have been invited to be on staff
<pony_8295> Granny smith made ponyville
<BronyCon> troll
<prince-dari> Ty.
<prince-dari> WHAT
<pony_8295> its canon
<Fazana> dundundun
<Randomnerd> Better than clopping to Fillies.
<Jim> Half caps is a pain to read
<pony_4680> throw the brick
<RaveBrony> mmmmm chalk
<Ghosties> 04Don't WHAT me
<prince-dari> I just said "If there are no full ops around"
<prince-dari> You can't notify them
<Ghosties> 04Go on Skype for Christ's sakes
<prince-dari> They're all gone

<prince-dari> None
<WingedCurse> still dont understand that random chalk licking...

<Fazana> okay, mabye she is just a tad crazy
<Kencolt> well, she's sort of both.
<Ghosties> 04And I'm talking about Skype

<LadyCanary> Yes
<WingedCurse> Jim: nope
<prince-dari> Oh my dear God.
<Yahooz> okeh ^_^
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *throws anti-matter gernade*
<karmatehwolfie> Amazing granny. So sweet, the sound.
<Ghosties> 04If you're all so adamant about it, then I'm telling you to be done with it
<BronyCon> NO
<Sammy> Y U NO get zapapple cutiemark
*Fleur only throws shoes and boots because she doesnt want people to get in the habbit of all capsing.
<Cypresswolf> his cutie mark...what is it? The table's corner is in the way
<Randomnerd> You'll notice they all share colours
<Yahooz> im going back to watching miracle then

<Saturn> 8,1*good
<RaveBrony> Be careful apple family! Some people may come along with some machine to make zap apple jam faster! D:
<Ghosties> 04Either halfops with no ability to ban (except for on live eps) or only ops
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01?
<Yahooz> yah
<Cheshire_Pony> Trolololololol
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hmm?
<Jericho> :D
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> just asking if anyone chatted
<Randomnerd> I think that the series will end with the CMC getting their Marks
<prince-dari> You don't get what I'm saying.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It's YouTube, you can't expect it to work as expected
<BronyCon> u mean s2?
<Fleur> that is weird... when Nittany_Discord pings me it doesnt ping me
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright! Time for the restream of this morning's episode
<RaveBrony> Hey, how long is this pony watching going on?
<prince-dari> I'm not saying if there aren't any full ops on IRC.
<WingedCurse> series? end? what u talkin bout?!
<Yahooz> like hell we do ^_^
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: and they'll be driven out of town because MLP is AGAINST THE FREE MARKET ECONOMY!
<Anthony> yay
<Dermathil> woohoo
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> YAY!!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> AWW YEAHHH
<Ghosties> 04You want a failsafe, I got that
<KernelCobb> soo....olnly 5 more days
<prince-dari> Exactly.
<RaveBrony> Lol!!! RAWRity xD
<Ghosties> 04I understand what you're saying
<Cypresswolf> Assuming the Flim Flam Brothers know how to make zap apples in the first place
<Dermathil> after that restream then we'll be allowed to talk about it
<Fazana> "only"
<Anthony> <3
<Fazana> UGH. 5 WHOLE DAYS
<Yahooz> NEW EP!
<KernelCobb> indeed
<Ghosties> 04But that defeats the purpose of a halfop not being allowed to ban
<Yahooz> Leggo!
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> look at that
<Dermathil> WOOHOO
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> "Only?!?"
<RaveBrony> This is true, Cypresswolf
<Ghosties> 04It defeats the principle
<ScootaChicken> My Little Communism: The State is Magic
<prince-dari> Well so does letting them ban during a pony episode
<pony_4680> fluttersleep
*Fleur restrains herself from throwing shoes
<Yahooz> New episode time
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> kool
<Randomnerd> Nah, the series. The CMC are going to be blank for the forseeable future, since the lesson is "Wait for good things"
<Fazana> Ooh
<pony_4680> lol
<RaveBrony> Dat fluttershy! ;P
<WingedCurse> low quality?
<Fazana> Now episode
<Tovler> lol, the bad quality stream
<Dermathil> lol
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> *squeak*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *squee*
<Night702> lol i saw this, this moarning
<Dashie> lawl
<Ghosties> 04There's a difference there because we have around 3,000 people as opposed to...what, 250?
<ArcherJoe11> first minute and already shipping.
<WingedCurse> the HD version is uploaded...
<Anthony> its the only one thats on youtube
<karmatehwolfie> I'm so exited i feel like shouting. Whoo-hoo!
<RaveBrony> sideways flying!
<KernelCobb> oh no she naked
<Dermathil> 1080p is out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can imagine someone putting a beer song to this episode.
<Dermathil> btw
<Randomnerd> Beg Pardon, Fluttershy... But we don't Normally Wear Clothes.
<Night702> cider= achohol
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> what one are we watching
<RAWRity> this episode sinches it, Apple Family confimred for Socialists.
<Fazana> faceplant
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> never saw this ep
<LadyCanary> Nittany_Discord: There is a song called "Beer!"
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Luna> 07,015000+ lately
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> pegasi are apparently part hummingbird
<Dashie> wait
*Tovler squints
<Dashie> cider
<Ghosties> 04Exactly
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Rainbow Dash x Fluttershy = awesome
<prince-dari> And 250/3000 makes no difference if with the 250 there's one guy with a spam bot that's sending 10 messages every second.
<WingedCurse> there are HD versions uploaded now
<ScootaChicken> Pinkie Pie has such epic bed hair
<Randomnerd> What is the malted liquor? What gets you drunker quicker?
<RaveBrony> dat instant hair fix!
<RAWRity> they are against healthy competion Next thing you know, they'll be telling Mayor Mare they're "too big to fail"!
<prince-dari> Or something spamming text walls of R34.
<Ingwaz> was a pretty good ep this morning, seems like hasbro has really stepped it up recently, the latest eps have had us all surprised several times
<Randomnerd> What comes in bottles and in cans?
<Cypresswolf> Pinkie's static style hair :P
<Saturn> 8,1or posting r34

<Kencolt> This episode also shows that Equestria has no Open Container laws.
<Luna> 07,01enjoy
<KernelCobb> pinkie gets crazier each episode
<RaveBrony> Rainbow Rage!
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> oh
<Fazana> pwny
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> kay
<Ghosties> 04Look, either only ops or halfops with no ban ability
<pony_4680> she is somad
<Jim> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-lets-get-to-that-party-quick.gif Goes will with the intro
<Ingwaz> baby cakes, last round up (derp), latest
<Ghosties> 04It was one of the key features of a halfop when we started out
<RAWRity> You heard it here on True Free Canterolist Radio!
<RaveBrony> im gettings my 'friends' ready now
<Yahooz> freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenz!
<RaveBrony> Frieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeendssss!
<Yahooz> XD
<Saturn> 8,1Ghosties: can i ask, what's the point of having half-ops that can't ban in the first place?
<Yahooz> I win
<prince-dari> I just don't understand why you object to a failsafe.
<RAWRity> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
<WingedCurse> ..
<RaveBrony> Curse you Yahooz! xD
*Fleur loves how Fluttershy got embarased when RD woke her up
<Cypresswolf> Next week is Read it & Weep, right?
<pony_4680> throw shoe!
<VioletVanilla> 06Think of halfops as a normal citizen with a gun. You are not allowed to kill someone unless you must. Otherwise, consult an admin before quickscope.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> YouTube is worse than Yahoo
<Fazana> Hehe
<Anthony> damn that cyder must be good
<WingedCurse> yep, wolf
<LadyCanary> Me too Fleur :3 :3
<otakon> Cypresswolf: eeyup
<RaveBrony> I think so, Cypress wolf
<otakon> huzzah!
<RAWRity> Fleur: well, she's embarrasd that she sleeps in the nude!
<LadyCanary> Squee!
<Dermathil> rawrity, they're the single biggest business in ponyville and are probably the single biggest income for the town. Them shutting down could be a pretty big problem to the town as a whole.
<prince-dari> Lawl Vi
<Fazana> Oh god
<RaveBrony> Lol, RAWRity xD
<KernelCobb> now i can't unhear it
<Ingwaz> hey, anybody know if on facebook you can send someone a private message even if you're not friends with them?
<Ghosties> 04Allowing them to use ban "but only when there's no one else around" is an insult to what a halfop is. It is completely derooting that principle
<KernelCobb> pwny...
<meh> wait wat
<Cypresswolf> Nice! 1 more week ^_^
<Jim> They don't normaly wear clothes
<VioletVanilla> 06I am being serious.
<Fazana> Ijust imagined Twist saying "Cider Season"
<meh> i just finished watching this lol
<otakon> RAWRity: but they don't normally wear clothes(Applejack voice)
<Anthony> looks like beer
<Ghosties> 04We started out with that "no banning allowed." You take that away, you're stripping the heirarchy
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Might as well just have Voice again then with ChanServ flags.
<RaveBrony> Lol xP
<Fazana> Thider Theathon
<Fleur> also, I better not hear a single spoiler *narrows her eyes threateningly
<prince-dari> So is 'allowing them to ban but only when there's loads of people around'
<Cypresswolf> frothy cider
<otakon> Anthony: nah, thats' the salt licks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder how long will this episode stay up before it's copyright claimed.
<otakon> Fleur: you we be AMAZED
<Saturn> 8,1Ghosties: do we really need that much heirarchy?
<Dashie> they're all alcoholics...
<meh> download it ahead of time
<pony_4680> she just had the so awsome face
<VioletVanilla> 06^
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: I give it three days
<pony_4680> wow
<Ghosties> 04You are essentially neutering what it means to be a halfop
<RAWRity> Dermathil: that's just what those socialist liberals want you to believe! Mayor Mare is against small business in equestria!
<Ingwaz> Nittany_Discord: usually you can find a few episodes that stay up, not all of them get taken down immediately
<RaveBrony> Poor Rainbow Dash!
<Shizuka> 13in the interest of time, while that is an exceedingly good point saturn, i'm going to move on
<Fazana> Rainbow rage
<pony_4680> T_T no RD
<prince-dari> It's also so you see how we enforce our rules.
<Anthony> aww
<LadyCanary> Wah wah wah.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Rainbow Rage
<ROHKARA> riot
<Fazana> Typical fluttershy :(
<otakon> Poor Rd is feening
<Ghosties> 04<Saturn> Ghosties: can i ask, what's the point of having half-ops that can't ban in the first place?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: the 480- ones seem to go unhindered, while Xyro's seem to last about a week before they get nixed.
<meh> lol
<Ghosties> 04It was principle, Saturn
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> RIOT!
<KernelCobb> she got cider
<Dashie_Dashie> I need my Fix man!
<otakon> I need my cider
<WingedCurse> but they have TONS of apples...
<prince-dari> If you have no idea how strict/lenient we are on certain things you might be way too harsh or the opposite.
<pony_4680> not enough
<otakon> I need it!*shakes*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> indeed they do
<Shizuka> 13ghosties, i have the floor
<RaveBrony> Song Song Song Song Song!!! Nowwww

<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> hey
<otakon> WingedCurse: it takes time to make it is all
<Dashie> sorry guys, going to lurk and watch this properly now, see y'all after this episode :)
<Randomnerd> Why don't they do this in advance? It ferments
<SirSprinkles> 00,06What dari said.
<KernelCobb> what?
<ROHKARA> Pinkie Pie is being a bitch
<otakon> see ya Dashie
<Saturn> 8,1aye, let's move on and talk about this tomorrow or something
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol Pinkie: U MAD?
<Dashie_Dashie> ragerageragerage
<RAWRity> Pinkie be trolling RD for being left in the desert.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I'd shoot Pinkie right now
<Fazana> MEXICANS INCOMING!!! AHHHH..hold on, I have nothing agaisn't Mexians. :(
<ArcherJoe11> RD gonna smash Pinkie
<Cheshire_Pony> LOL Pinkie ; w ;

<Randomnerd> Pinkie Might really be that clueless?
<otakon> dat Pinkie
<Shizuka> 13last topic from me, channel topics, we can make better use of them and should
<pony_4680> so effin mad dash is
<Tovler> Seatbelts, Everyone!
<otakon> I LOVE it
<Cypresswolf> Rainbow Rage inbound
<meh> never again
<SirSprinkles> 00,06>endlessly long meeting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought this episode mirrored two game publisher. Fim Flams = Activision. Apple Family = Valve.
<otakon> Tovler: dam
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I admit, I would have shot Pinkie in the face
<SirSprinkles> 00,06>save some of it for tomorrow
<Ingwaz> you know....had a thought...pinkie is definitely not the element of generousity, she bought a ton of cider...yet shares none with RD
<Shizuka> 13excuse me
<KernelCobb> I agree...pinkie has become TOO random
<Kencolt> And here somes the Music Man redesigned.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06...what
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> oooooooooookkkkkkkk
*Jim buckles up
<Shizuka> 13i have the floor
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Dermathil> Rawrity: and Mayor Mare needs money from Applejack's prizes to fix the town roof. Also, quills and sofas and sugarcube corner are other examples.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Apologies, continue.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you and your videogame parable
<Fazana> trolltrain
<prince-dari> And we finish the discussion of each point before moving on
<Dermathil> Bacon manes!
<Hydrazine> thats some bad parking skills
<WingedCurse> lol Nittany_Discord
<Dashie_Dashie> Activison = terrible game makers.
<meh> ikr Ingwaz
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: indeed. The Apple family can't count to 3 either.
<prince-dari> We don't just have one person decide when to move onwards.
<otakon> I love this song
*Fleur turns off the stream and closes the chat as she goes to youtube to watch
<meh> me too otakon
<LadyCanary> ...Oh my gosh.
<ROHKARA> I just had a thought; what if Rarity and Pinkie Pie are trying to make sure Rainbow Dash doesn't get cider
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol They have bacon hair
<Tovler> Applewood-cured bacon hair
<Anthony> new song ahh yea
<RaveBrony> Those clothes!
<prince-dari> Otherwise nothing gets decided
<otakon> SuperBrony64: yes they do
<RaveBrony> yes!
<WingedCurse> cant unsee SB64
<meh> cya later Fleur
<Jim> LC approves
<Ingwaz> it makes me sad...i got taken in by these two...then i realized mid way that theyre conmen...
<fluttershyfan158> g2g by!!
<prince-dari> We need to come to a conclusion
<KernelCobb> i swear this whole scene is a reference to some movie...just can't remember the name
<Cypresswolf> I didnt make the connection to Music Man...been long time since I've seen it
<Hydrazine> so which one has the mustache?
<RAWRity> i didn't know LordCelestia was in this show!
<Dashie_Dashie> Bacon mane SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Bai fluttershyfan158!
*LadyCanary bounces up and down
<ScootaChicken> SuperBrony64, they're LC's children
<Hydrazine> flim or flam?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision: Quantity and profit over quantity. Valve = taking time for their projects.
<otakon> Ingwaz: that's how it works
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<Kencolt> Telling you-- I've SEEN this movie.
<Freeman> ive already watched this
<Randomnerd> See ya, fluttershyfan158

<prince-dari> >on hold until tomorrow
<Randomnerd> Who names their kids "Flim" and "Flam"?!
<Fazana> I have a rainbow background :3
<Dermathil> new body shapes!
<RAWRity> LordCelestia: well whoops them into shape.
<ScootaChicken> LordCelestia, why didn't you raise them to be good and socialist?
<prince-dari> The whole point is to get things that have been on hold forever out of the way
<pony_4680> derpy
<ScootaChicken> you are a bad parent
<fillyfillyy> again
<ArcherJoe11> Flim: no Moustache Flam: with Moustache
<prince-dari> A decision to be made on them
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> same here
<Anthony> epic voices
<otakon> Dermathil: not really, it's Post Box's design
<RaveBrony> I love how they say "FLim Flam brothers" :)
<WingedCurse> Randomnerd: rednecks?
<Dermathil> otakon: oh? Oh well.
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> i was hoping it would more of a challenge to find her in this episode
<Ingwaz> i suppose my only respite is that they were not literally selling me something
<RAWRity> also, I like how their cutie marks match up.
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> i have luna background
<Cypresswolf> I've only seen Roseluck in 1 shot so far
<Randomnerd> WingedCurse: Maybe?
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Plus, gathering everyone tomorrow would only be more of a pain.
<Kencolt> Rex Harrison Lives as a pony.
<Fazana> DISPENSER
<LadyCanary> Daniel Ingram has done it again!!
<Ingwaz> do have to admit, they have style
<WingedCurse> :D
<Saturn> 8,1yes, but i've got some points i want to bring up too, and i need to go soon
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Valve: "Every episode we don't see Trixie, we delay Half-Life 3 by a month"
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: It's pretty clever, yeah
<RaveBrony> Rarity thinks theyre cute??? What??

<Randomnerd> John Henry, Fleur
<Dermathil> Randomnerd: also, ponies who want to give their twins theme names.
<Ingwaz> hmmm, i would enjoy it immensely if valve turned out to be bronies
<VioletVanilla> 06Well, it seems that its more of an admin argument. Why not discuss it with the admins, then tell the halfops what you decide?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *sadface*
<karmatehwolfie> Flim flam means "to cheat."

<Shizuka> 13proposal: with bronystate 2.0, an irc bot we can command when we start a stream, it goes through all channels and updates the topic to say who is on stream
<LadyCanary> My goodness, this song is long.
<RAWRity> otakon: to be fair, trying to put another company out of business because they won't agree to a crappy business partnership is pretty shady business practices.

<Saturn> 8,1right, first of all, streams: this is something i'm going to bring up more next week in the tech meeting, but what are everyone's experiences with stream stability?
<fillyfillyy> exactly
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you like cider? don't you rainbow?
<Cypresswolf> Where would Flim & Flam get the apples they need to drive the Apples out of business in the first place? Importing apples from outside Ponyville would drive up their cider price
<RaveBrony> Scootaloooooo
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Pinkie Pie ^-^: You like apple cider, don't you Rainbow Dash?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01it's should be its
<Jim> Scooot
<Randomnerd> It. Is. ON!
<Phase4> hello silence my old friend
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Sup!
<WingedCurse> dat BTTF reference
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kencolt> No, That's scoota-- Oh, wait.
<otakon> Cypresswolf: they steal the apples
<meh> oh no he didnt
<Saturn> 8,1are we happy with the streaming methods we use at the moment?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mixed.
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: they are not clever ponies.
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> ik
<pony_8295> granny smith is getting trolled
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> DO A BARREL ROLL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most people hate mips for the ads.
<otakon> the south field
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SuperBrony64: :)
<Hazard_3_> exactly
<Saturn> 8,1are we happy with the way that ads are served on these platforms?
<Ghosties> 04HATE mips for the ads
<meh> challenge accepted
<prince-dari> We make do with what we've got.
<Kencolt> No, thye are clever. Just not smart.
<Ghosties> 04But the quality is phenomenal
<prince-dari> If there was a better solution we'd use it
<fillyfillyy> there should be a taste testing portion of the battle
<RAWRity> or, they buy out Sweet Apple Acres and set up shop there.
<otakon> indeed
<Randomnerd> Well, they should talk to Filthy Rich.
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> ikr
<RaveBrony> ^^
<Hydrazine> hehe
<Fazana> Man, those Mexican like Connies are so trolls
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I don't see the ads.
<pony-4681> alright it works
<Saturn> 8,1and should we look into setting up our own streaming server instead?
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> that would make it fair
<Fazana> ALSO
<prince-dari> We have
<otakon> Hell, I think they had the barrels in reserve
<meh> lol im lucky i just finished watching this with my sis turn on the stream to see it again :D
<Ghosties> 04It's unfortunate that I may have to get adblock, but I'll manage
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We certainly have a plethora of options at our disposal so at least we have options when one goes down (like MIPS this morning)
<Placebo> Tear down Sweet apple acres, building shopping mall.
<prince-dari> I set up one on Luna's PC
<Hazard_3_> bringing in the big hoofs
<Fazana> ISN'T THIS THE THIRD APPLE EPISODE IN 4?
<Tovler> We represent Pizza Dinosaur...
<prince-dari> It's not practical.
<RAWRity> i dunno, Filthy Rich seems to have some ties to the Apple Family
<Randomnerd> Go, Big Macintosh, go!
<otakon> Go Big Mac GO!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm just saying others aren't as lucky or knowing of ad block plus.
<WingedCurse> steampunk big mac
<Hazard_3_> more pinkie
<RaveBrony> ^^^
<RaveBrony> <3
*otakon dons his giant foam finger
<KernelCobb> more trixie
<Fazana> Zap apple, Apple rodeo and this
<RaveBrony> lol
*SuperBrony64 /)(\ TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<otakon> GO APPLE FAMILY! Go!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<Placebo> Don't you need a hoof?
<prince-dari> The quality was no where near as good as with the online streaming services we use
<pony-4681> more flutter
<Kencolt> That's HER name!
<RAWRity> "They paved Ponyville, and put up a parking lot..."
<Hazard_3_> yeah
<Luna> 07,01^
<fluttercry> 05,15why couldn't people get adblock plus though, I got it in the middle of movie night and never had another issue
<Hazard_3_> more fluttershy
<Cypresswolf> How would the Apples lose their farm with hundres? of acres of apple trees at the ready? Am I missing something here
<prince-dari> And even with Luna's godly internet, probably wouldn't handle the usage.
<OneTrickPony> doctor HOOVES!!
<Saturn> 8,1prince-dari: i'm thinking more a dedicated solution, but i'll talk more about the 'how's in the tech meeting
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat Doctor Whooves
<RaveBrony> Dat hour glass!!
<ArcherJoe11> Doctor Whooves is turning with Time
<pony-4681> they r so ready
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Agreed!
<Fazana> We had only 1 FS ep yet
<Saturn> 8,1i'm just asking should we look into it
<Randomnerd> RAWRity: Trouble is, if those connections were really strong, the Ponyville Ponies would have dismissed Flim and Flam out of hoof.
<WingedCurse> the timelord :D
<Anthony> shit just got real
<prince-dari> We have though
<meh> so freakin awesome
<Fazana> which is Stare Master
<prince-dari> That's what I'm saying
<otakon> Cypresswolf: a bet is a bet, and the apples hold to their word
<pony-4681> their bodys are ready
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Y U No turn back time and destroy their invention!?
<Saturn> 8,1because it's perfectly possible, but there are some other considerations too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't some of your older services get shut down?
<prince-dari> And if it involves money it's a no-go too.
<Hazard_3_> lolwut
<meh> because they arent aliens
<WingedCurse> ^
<otakon> SuperBrony64: no Tardis and fixed point
<Luna> 07,01^ dat depends
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Poor Applejack ;___;
<Fazana> Trolled
<Saturn> 8,1prince-dari: that's somethign i'll come to in a bit; but i may have a solution taht solves those problems
<Randomnerd> Hey there!
<prince-dari> Because we stream copyrighted material the chances are we'll pay for a service and then lose it.
<LadyCanary> ....Holy moley.
<Hazard_3_> *trollface*
<Placebo> Seriously, Mac. Do you really need goggles? It's not like you're moving, the wind can't be that bad.
<Luna> 07,01but let's talk about it during the tech meeting
<Anthony> :[
<Moshakra> Hey, is this a new episode
<pony_8421> lol
<meh> all the faces this episode were awesome
<Ingwaz> SuperBrony64, i find your lack of faith disturbing
<Fazana> Yes
<Saturn> 8,1yeah, that was really leading into my next point
<KernelCobb> this is THE new episode
<Randomnerd> Goggles mean srs bsns
<Hazard_3_> lol
<prince-dari> And I'm pretty sure earlier on we decided it wasn't worth that risk when the free providers are alright.
<ArcherJoe11> Placebo: it#
<otakon> Placebo: you should ALWAYS wear proper protection when working
<RAWRity> Cypresswolf: they rely on selling their Cider to keep afloat through the winter when they can't grow anything. Poor apple sales = Having to sell the farm to afford food.
<Kencolt> There are apples splatting all over the place-- I'd wear goggles too.
<Moshakra> another applejack one?
<Phase4> hello
<KernelCobb> oh yea
<Hazard_3_> and ive gotten about sick of applejack
<Fazana> Yeah
<Fazana> 3rd one in 4
<Ingwaz> should dr. whooves have deprived applejack of an opportunity to learn.....oh yeah...she didnt learn anything
<Ingwaz> nvm
<Hazard_3_> accept for the last one
<otakon> GO BIG MAC! WOOO!
<ArcherJoe11> Placebo: it's to keep sweat from his eyes
<Hazard_3_> derpy was the acception
<Randomnerd> How are you?
<Moshakra> yeah =P
<KernelCobb> derpy stole the show
<WingedCurse> lol ArcherJoe11
<Phase4> i'm good
<otakon> the cavalry have arrived!
<Placebo> ArcherJoe11: That's called a sweat-band.
<Saturn> 8,1well, having me here gives you some new options and experience that you didn't have before, so i'll leave the rest of that for the tech meeting
<Ingwaz> this part made my heart melt a bit
<KernelCobb> no complaints
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos, my next point is two things, really
<meh> me too
<Hazard_3_> exactly
<KernelCobb> :P
<Randomnerd> Cockiness is a definite flaw in Equestria.
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> srry checking my facebokk
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Same
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai Ingwaz :3
<otakon> arrogant bastards
<pony-4681> sisters :D
<Ingwaz> ohai der SuperBrony64
<Dermathil> did I see Lyra jumping in the background?!
<RaveBrony> Flim and Flam agreed to them helping!! Nobody argue! lol
<Cypresswolf> Why is it so expensive to run a farm? O_o Especially with a monopoly of Apples in Ponyville
<RAWRity> proof that AJ learned her lesson in Applebuckign Season well.
<LadyCanary> Oh it is ON
<otakon> yeah, sweet moment there
<Saturn> 8,1first is another thing i'll go into at the tech meeting, but the other is more for here
<Hazard_3_> braveheart!
<RAWRity> Dermathil: eeyup
<otakon> RAWRity: agreed
<Ouroboros> Indeed RAWRity.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Everypony!
<RaveBrony> Lol! RAWRity
<IshBestPony> of course Fluttershy would help with the trees
<Ingwaz> uhh Cypresswolf....you obviously dont know about farming
<EspyLacopa> noooo, the MLP laptops were a fake. . .
<RaveBrony> I agree
<fillyfillyy> i love how she ummm 'bucks' the apples
<KernelCobb> surprised they didn't make a pinkie sense reference
<Cypresswolf> No I dont.
<Hazard_3_> your not sleeping!
<Hydrazine> go power ponies
<Saturn> 8,1with BS2.0, i think it will make a lot of sense for us to move away from 000webhost
<Ingwaz> farming is not cheap, nor is it easy, a crop can easily go bad then you're low on money
<Moshakra> Go fluttershy
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> is it wrong to masturbate to pony porn
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Aww
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHiRC_sNX4w has worked so far, not to see if the upload works
<KernelCobb> yes
<WingedCurse> dat RD innuenedo...
<Kencolt> Ultimate Organizer In the house. Field. Orchard.
<pony_8421> fluttertree
<Randomnerd> Equestria does not have a subsidy program.
<Moshakra> epic
<Ingwaz> among many many other things
<Hazard_3_> sometimes
<otakon> all that shaking
<Hazard_3_> i dont though
<prince-dari> Any web hosts in mind?
<meh> fluttershy is the tree whisperer
<otakon> yes!
<Saturn> 8,1there are a number of reasons for this, including security, featureset, and our new requirements
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> im surprised she can buck so many apples in 1 hour
<RaveBrony> Lovely! :D
<IshBestPony> maybe it is maybe it isn't
<Moshakra> they need scootaloo on that treadmill
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> i do
<RAWRity> "Lovely. Horrid! Horrid! Lovely."
<LadyCanary> So much teamwork!
<Dermathil> Someone's gonna make this in part of rhythm ponies series.
<Placebo> Brace yourselves... Moar bigmacxRD shipping.
<Fazana> Nah
<ArcherJoe11> ALL of Canterlot, huh? http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/120667?search=Luna
<otakon> and Twi handles teh assembly
<Fazana> She would be too "Chicken"
<Tovler> So, if more of the apple family had been around, there'd be no contest.
<Hydrazine> just ask the tree to drop the apples
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> but im still a kid
<Fazana> BADUMYSH
<Saturn> 8,1but one of the biggest thigns is that i think we should have way more control over our site than we curretnly do
<RAWRity> inb4 they make a Rythm Heaven parody with "lovely! Horrid!"
<ScootaChicken> the power has been DOUBLED!
<Randomnerd> And inventory.
<Kencolt> And here's where the Bros screw up.
<Moshakra> She would be like a penguin
<IshBestPony> Unicorn lazers are now canon
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I expected the machine to explode.
<RaveBrony> Stop stealing fluttershy!
<Saturn> 8,1especially considering that we stream copyrighted material
<otakon> and here is where things go wrong
<Ingwaz> surprised applejack wasnt pissed they were ripping her trees out
<Randomnerd> The Moral: Don't Half-Ass it.
<meh> ikr
<KernelCobb> chickens can't run very fast
<Dermathil> Ingwaz she's kinda occupied
<Hazard_3_> thats about disqusting
<Fazana> Pwned
<Saturn> 8,1a solution i'm suggesting is moving to EC2 on Amazon Web sErvices
<pony_8421> lol
<otakon> Ingwaz: they agreed to it
<RaveBrony> Same, Kira_Pony_Yamato
<pony-4681> big mac lol
<pony_8421> mac
<Fazana> Exactly
<Fazana> they haxed
<otakon> poor Mac!
<Ingwaz> they didnt agree to have their trees destroyed
<WingedCurse> big mac physics
<Placebo> Randomnerd: AJ: Ah di'nt learn anythin'!
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> get off the dmn screen
<RaveBrony> I expected the machine to fail...
<Hazard_3_> HAX
<Cypresswolf> Jetsons referece!
<otakon> YOU GO GrannY!
<Saturn> 8,1we could use their free teir for setting up our own vritual server
<prince-dari> This is more for the tech meeting though.
<Ingwaz> they agreed to let them use the apples from the south field
<pony-4681> double time
<otakon> RaveBrony: me too
<Hazard_3_> RUN
<ScootaChicken> wow, Nittany_Discord's Valve/Activision parallel really works...
<Luna> 07,01yea.
<WingedCurse> jetsons reference?
<Saturn> 8,1yeah, i won't go into the guts of it here
<Ingwaz> not uproot the trees which would severely damage their livelihood
<Hazard_3_> i was in the pinkie pie chat the other day
<Saturn> 8,1but this is part of a wider point
<Hazard_3_> CHAOTIC
<Moshakra> lolololol
<RAWRity> WingedCurse: when RD gets off the track and Big Mac goes spinning around the treadmill
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> thats one big pyramid of cider barrels
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It does.
<HeavyMetalDash> http://sinshi666.deviantart.com/#/d4nwvyr
<pony-4681> they...
<IshBestPony> ohai #Bronystate
<Cypresswolf> When Big Mac slipped and was spinning around on the treadmill
<HeavyMetalDash> Hi Everypony!
<Hazard_3_> is she getting humped?
<WingedCurse> oooohh, i see
<pony-4681> lost :(
<Saturn> 8,1to do something like this (which is somethign that would benefit us greatly) we may need a small amount of money to keep it going
<Jim> hai IshBestPony
<Fazana> eeyup
<otakon> hiya IshBestPony
<Saturn> 8,1i'm talking $2 - $5 a month
<otakon> yeah
<RAWRity> you can practically hear him shouting "AJ! Stop this crazy thing!"
<LadyCanary> Very nice HeavyMetalDash!
<Randomnerd> Hey HeavyMetalDash
<Jim> nice drawing HeavyMetalDash
<otakon> too bad their Cider is crap
<Luna> 07,01poor AJ :(
<Hazard_3_> theirs tastes like SHIT
<fillyfillyy> y stack them like that y not in a 4 sided pyramid? harder to count i guess
<LadyCanary> And hi IshBestPony!
<RaveBrony> I now expected the town to turn on them!!!
<meh> this part made me so sad
<RaveBrony> I was then disappointed...
<KernelCobb> i'd rather drink shit
*IshBestPony hugs Jim and otakon and LadyCanary
<Ingwaz> they do have style but somebody needs to shank these jerks
<Saturn> 8,1even inside free tier, because it's based on what you use, we might go slightly over
*otakon hugs Luna "Hello Dear!"
<Moshakra> how fancy
<Randomnerd> Their Cider is BEYOND crap, it's a health hazard.
<Saturn> 8,1it may even be under $1 a month
<Luna> 07,01ohai
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> indeed
<Fazana> OH GOD
<WingedCurse> wow, BTTF, jetsons, AND john henery references in one episode
<RaveBrony> dat laugh
<Fazana> Dexter laugh
<Hazard_3_> were those hemp leaves in the background of their banner?!
<fillyfillyy> how is big mackintosh an apple name BTW? am i that stupid?
<otakon> Randomnerd: drek
<Moshakra> why would she have signed up for that
<Randomnerd> lol
<Jim> D:

<KernelCobb> mandark*
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> a Macintosh is a type of apple
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who pays? Us? Donations?
<Hazard_3_> it was appleblooms fault
<Saturn> 8,1but still, i wanted to raise the issue of raising money for the site's operations
*Luna hugs everypony
<kirzstryfe> 1,3type of apple I think?
<fillyfillyy> ok
<meh> just noticed how their cutiemarks fit together
<otakon> :)
<Saturn> 8,1i have a couple of ideas
<fillyfillyy> but still
<Randomnerd> Evidently Yiddish exists in Equestria
<HeavyMetalDash> Finally finished that after a couple hours...I luv this episode BTW
<RaveBrony> :'(
<RAWRity> BTW, I LOVE the voice they give the pink BG pony here. It's so hilarious! XD
<Ingwaz> i kind of wished everypony had literally driven them out of town without even having to taste the cider
<pony-4681> :'(
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> there was a BTTF refference?
<ScootaChicken> ohai Luna ^_^
<otakon> meh: I said that already
<Kencolt> If you want t call it cider...

<OneTrickPony> Tom is in Bon Bon's cider
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She's a pony of a million voices.
<Jim> suddenly, bits
<ValtheJean> I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE
<otakon> NO!
<RAWRity> like I said, Bon Bon is a Voice Actor in Equestria, thus why she has so many voices.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Team rocket is blasting off again!

<prince-dari> Since we'd be legit then
<Dashie_Dashie> Someone help me find a "Deal or no Deal" Clip

<Luna> 07,01that's an option
<pony_4270> does anypony know what the preshow videos were this morning? Specifically the one with Pinkie Pie, the band and twilight in the background?
<Saturn> 8,1 2) t-shirts and other merch. this is a popular idea, and i know our users would buy BS merch

<Phase4> if you see a guy called 'Amazon' can you give him that link?
<otakon> Randomnerd: true, but the final product was CRAP
<Yahooz> #Vinyl_Scratch
<Hazard_3_> NO G3!
<KernelCobb> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It was.
<Phase4> processing == uploading
<kirzstryfe> 1,3The McIntosh Red (or McIntosh; colloquially, the Mac) is an apple cultivar with red and green skin, a tart flavor, and tender white flesh.
<Saturn> 8,1i know DCD currently does commissions too
<Ingwaz> Randomnerd: you can win in speed but if you dont have quality, nobody will want your product
<Hazard_3_> BURN!
<Randomnerd> But they screwed themselves because it was undrinkable
<fillyfillyy> TY kirzstrfe
<Saturn> 8,1maybe step that up a notch
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> wow
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> i like them a bit
<Mutterguy> IshBestPony: look up rod from god and consider what a unicorn with powerful telekinesis can do
<Dermathil> heh
<Ingwaz> and technically, they lost, they didnt make cider, that cant count as cider
<pony-4681> no not into the pit IT BURNS
<Ouroboros> Hmm apparently the Flim Flam brothers song is based on "Ya Got Trouble" from The Music Man.
<Moshakra> GTFO
<Moshakra> xD
<KernelCobb> "totally unrainbow"
<NullRadix> assuming I remember, sure
<Cypresswolf> I cant stay for the post show this time, Ill see yall next week
*Dermathil rolleyes
<Saturn> 8,1i guess my point here is that money shouldn't be an issue for moving to EC"
<Ingwaz> they said their cider was top quality, that stuff was junk
<Kencolt> N ot really. They failed at making cider. The barrlels were at the end full of... Um... well, you ask Pinkie Pie. She knows all about that.
<RaveBrony> Can someone tell me how to enter the lotto so I can enter next week??????
<Tovler> So if I challenge Starbucks to a coffee-off I can run them out of business?
<Hazard_3_> sup guys first time!
<Saturn> 8,1*EC2
<LadyCanary> ...Thats awesome Ouroboros!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Please don't post anything in #Vinyl_Scratch until I say the word. Remember to follow the rules with requests and nothing longer tahn 10 min.
<Randomnerd> I know that, I was explaining for RawketLawnchair
<Hazard_3_> awesome
<fillyfillyy> another ep..?
<Moshakra> Well
<Ingwaz> oh, i didnt see that part
<Moshakra> this is exciting.
<Hazard_3_> u dare bring light into my lair?!
<SkyLight_Broke-Horn> :'( u hurt my feelings
<Hazard_3_> U MUST DAI!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Go!
<pony_4270> SuperBrony64, do you know what video this morning was that had pinkie pie in front of a band eating stuff?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3SB is setting up for requests
<NullRadix> Odds are I'll get distracted parsing this code, forget about it, and come across the notepad doc when I'm shutting down my computer this evening
<Moshakra> I'm scared by the guy on the left
<Saturn> 8,1also, 3) the dreaded ads. we could put some up, and i'm sure we could generate some income for the site from them, but do we want to?
<Ingwaz> daniel ingram is win
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> 6_9
<Dermathil> owait sorry. Forgot not everybody has of those apples being cultivated a few dozen kilometers away.
<RawketLawnchair> They should have won, because the Apples cheated.
<Hazard_3_> :(
<Randomnerd> Kencolt: good point, it's pretty failtastic at the end.
<Ghosties> 04Well, merchandise shouldn't be a problem yeah
<pony_4270> with twilight making funny faces in the background?
<RawketLawnchair> That, and they cannot unto quality control.
<Ingwaz> peckish pony 2 pony_4270
<Hazard_3_> haha
<Ghosties> 04Commissions, clothing, music, etc.
<Saturn> 8,1personally, i like 2 the best
<Phase4> yeah, happens to me too
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^
<KernelCobb> pinkie is staring at me
<prince-dari> I'm not sure about ads.
<pony-4681> so ur scared of urself?
<pony_4270> kk thx
<Hazard_3_> lol
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p Dermathil
<ArcherJoe11> Ingwaz: that was because Wood got into the cider. during the song the cider was great.
<prince-dari> Because ad revenue would probably be pretty meh.
<Ingwaz> twilight is best trumpet player
<fillyfillyy> so why ecactly couldnt we watch epic movie?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But then again what video DOESN'T have Pinkie Pie eating stuff :D
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> ?
<Hazard_3_> this IS better than kongregate
<Luna> 07,01on the new domain it would be interesting
<Dermathil> :P
<prince-dari> I guess it depends on how intrusive the look.
<pony-4681> that it?
<pony_4270> lol
<ValtheJean> well, I dunno
<Saturn> 8,1well, we do get at least 5000 imperessions a week
<Hazard_3_> so what happens after the episode ends?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3bed reception of it during last night's showing
<Ghosties> 04^On top of that, I'd like to draw the least amount of attention to us with corporations and IPs
<Randomnerd> I would have liked it had Grannie tricked them using underripe apples.
<Moshakra> that awkward moment when it isn't awkward
<pony-4681> that's all they got?
<Luna> 07,01^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<fillyfillyy> ok
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<prince-dari> Well we wouldn't for the new domain Saturn.
<prince-dari> And that's where the ads would be.
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: well, i can think of ONE.
<Ingwaz> that may be ArcherJoe11, but they said their cider was top quality, the end product was garbage, they lost, fair and square
<ValtheJean> if we made it so to get to the theater page, they had to go through and advertisement, that's at least 5000 people a week
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Last thing we need is a cease and decist.
<Hydrazine> nah, that would be cheating
<Randomnerd> But the machine can probably detect ripeness, as well as rot.
<Hazard_3_> apparently
<Ghosties> 04Exactly
<Jim> The apple family isn't cheaters
<prince-dari> Because pony eps would still be on the old domain.
<ValtheJean> an*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or worse.
<Moshakra> he's loading up the next one/movie
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> ah
<Hazard_3_> movie?
<Ghosties> 04Don't say worse
<Dermathil> well, because most people had already seen it before and as such they could see the jokes coming
<Moshakra> yeah
<Cheshire_Pony> Mobie?
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> oh
<Moshakra> they show movies on here.
*Luna panics
<Cheshire_Pony> *Movie
<Kencolt> They made the mistake of shutting down the Quality Control mechanism...
<Hazard_3_> like real cinema movies?!
<Dermathil> (I didn't and as such found it hillarious)
<Saturn> 8,1okay, well, it's something to think about
<Luna> 07,01okay anything else?
<Moshakra> Mhmm
<pony-4681> what game/show says that's it thats all they got?
<Saturn> 8,1 2 secs
<Luna> 07,01ok
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> are you sure she didn't RAWRity?
<Hazard_3_> thats some cool shit
<Moshakra> they showed Alice in wonderland and Epic movie
<KernelCobb> like Epic Movie last night
<Dermathil> it is mostly using shock jokes that only work once.
<Moshakra> yeah
<Saturn> 8,1oh, yes, roles of techies
<RaveBrony> Woah! Icant believe I didnt notice Derpy during the Flim Flam song O.o
<Moshakra> funny shit
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> what are we gonna watch next :D ?
<Saturn> 8,1but i think we already covered that
<pony-4681> NO EPIC MOVIE
<Moshakra> xD
<pony-4681> no pls
<Dermathil> the postshow.
<Hazard_3_> lol i could watch that XD
<Saturn> 8,1only ops are allowed to stream, yes?
<Cheshire_Pony> ALICE IN WONDERLAND?!?!?!?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's really a 1-time movie, seeing it more doesn't do anything for the movie
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> oh
<Tovler> So, if the brother hadn't gotten overconfident and allowed outside help, the would have won.
<Moshakra> it's better when you're in chat room
<Dermathil> aka people requests
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<Hydrazine> they would have won if the others wouldn't have helped
<Moshakra> there we go
<Cheshire_Pony> And I missed it D:???
<Hazard_3_> YES
<prince-dari> Ops and designated streamers
<Moshakra> yep
<Moshakra> twice.
<KernelCobb> Mhm
<Dermathil> that's what I said kirz
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<RaveBrony> Indeed, Tovler
<OneTrickPony> yay Pendulum
<Ingwaz> so, everypony help me out here, can you send someone a message on facebook if you are not listed as their friend?
<otakon> Tovler: eeyup
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> .
<Saturn> 8,1also, can me and shizu get access to the live site?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol sorry, none of that heavy metal music
<OneTrickPony> aw
<Randomnerd> Discord would have won had he just eaten the Mane 6
<otakon> Ingwaz: enope sorry
<Hazard_3_> cool
<Moshakra> ON TO THE YOUTUBE FANFICS
<Saturn> 8,1i.e. the 000 account
<pony-4681> hmm
<LadyCanary> ...Mastodon. I think.
<otakon> not that I know of
<HeavyMetalDash> boooo
<Randomnerd> Evil is arrogant
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: it's not...it's DnB.
<Yahooz> XD
*Luna was headbobbing
<NullRadix> Or I'll get distracted reading FO:E-PH (if it updates tonight... which it seems to semi-consistantly)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yes, but I said it in GLORIOUS Technicolor :3
<Ingwaz> hmm, are you sure? it has the option to send a message
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Hazard_3_> *headbangs*
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos
<Saturn> 8,1moving on
<otakon> dis music
<Moshakra> with ozzy xD
<Yahooz> RAWRity's request got thrown in the pooper
<Saturn> 8,1n
<Kencolt> That's why 'The Last Roundup" floored so many ponies. We're so used to trying to find Derpy in the most unlikely places that when she was shoved in our faces like that , well...
<Saturn> 8,1
<Saturn> 8,1
<RaveBrony> I was actually ashamed to see that the Apple Family didnt welcome technology :\
<Saturn> 8,1
<otakon> ummmm
<kirzstryfe> 1,3<3
<Saturn> 8,1whoops
<Moshakra> well not really
<Saturn> 8,1connection derp
<Ingwaz> but i'm guessing that you cant as i have begun my "pony assualt" on my brother in an attempt to convert im, yet he has not responded
<IshBestPony> SuperBrony64 :(
<pony-4681> well im going now seeya and brohoof
<Dermathil> Technicolor seems to be compensating for something else if you ask me.
<RaveBrony> Wouldve added a new element to the farm :P
<Luna> 07,01@ RaveBrony technology can be bad to old traditions
<Hazard_3_> this is so hardcore *licks lips*
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<Moshakra> i saw this same video with a different song yesterday
<otakon> ^^
<RaveBrony> True^
<Saturn> 8,1next and final point isn't really about tech
<Hazard_3_> by pony
<Tovler> So... huh... I guess I should have turned my brain off during the episode.
<Randomnerd> Well, the flim-flam brothers offered an unfair deal
<Dermathil> Trololo
<Moshakra> see ya unnamed pon
<WingedCurse> just like john henry...
<Moshakra> yy
<otakon> Tovler: no, why?
<fillyfillyy> im gonna listen to my own music i will still be on chat
<Saturn> 8,1i noticed that in the rules, our classification of a B movie is... misleading
<Ingwaz> unfair is not even an appropriate description
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I've been staring at text walls for the past 10 hours, I'm bored :p
<Dashie> I are back everypony
<Kencolt> They probably would have gone for a fair deal. That deal was far from fair.
<Ingwaz> 25% for the apple family?
<Saturn> 8,1i don't like the wording "generally bad"
<otakon> yeah
<Randomnerd> 75% of the profits is hardly acceptable.
<otakon> they supply the apples
<Hazard_3_> the fact that this clip is in it makes it 20% cooler
<otakon> it should have been 50 50
<Saturn> 8,1it makes people think we want to watch terrible movies, like Epic Movie
<zackoroth> they were offered to just buy the machine first were they not?
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> same :P
<Kencolt> And the vast majority of the work.
<prince-dari> We do
<Ingwaz> 60% would have been fair imo, the machine requires no work from them
<prince-dari> :D
<Randomnerd> Even Filthy Rich probably gives better prices to his suppliers.
<Saturn> 8,1when there are tons and tons of great low budget movies and cult classics out there
<Dermathil> kirz, I've been coming to bronystate consistently everyday since mid-may and never winning the lottery. You ain't got nothing on me, and you know it.
<Moshakra> it's ponies, it doesn't need to be 20% cooler xD
*IshBestPony bangs his head
<Ingwaz> 60% for the apple family i mean
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :l
<Shizuka> 13well, it takes a certain level of bad, like plan 9
<Ouroboros> Is the stream muted? (or is it jsut me?)
<Hazard_3_> true
<Midnight_Fire> welcome to the world of business
<Moshakra> daww
<otakon> Ouroboros: just you I think
<Saturn> 8,1as i said in the chat ealier, "so bad it's good" is cool
<Hazard_3_> omg its picking up!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<Ingwaz> its just you Ouroboros
<Kencolt> He must-- he's respected.
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<prince-dari> Battlefield Leverage bad is beautiful
<Saturn> 8,1but "so bad it's horrible" is bleh
*kirzstryfe won once >.>
<Ouroboros> Thanks.
<RAWRity> zackoroth: no, they were offered a partnership where they would provide the apples and sell the cider, and would get only 25% of profits.
<Dermathil> exactly.
<Randomnerd> zackoroth: they weren't going to sell the machine, it's easier for them to offer it
<prince-dari> >so bad it's good is subjective
<Saturn> 8,1i think we should change the wording there
<RaveBrony> You know....thinking about the episode again... it wudve been nice for the Apples to be a match for the machine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We should post that XKCD comic on the rules page.
<fillyfillyy> wat did you pick wen you won?
<Randomnerd> If they sold it, they'd have to build more.
<KernelCobb> how did she not see that coming?
<Dermathil> I still come back even though my karma is the bitchiest on the goshdarn planet.
<RaveBrony> and then Flim and Flam try to sabbotage the Apples stuff O.o
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Glomp pile!
<Saturn> 8,1well, yes, but i think we should just be a bit clearer that we don't want to torture ourselves
<Hazard_3_> idk O_O
<Moshakra> she didn't need to
<Hazard_3_> D:
*kirzstryfe pulls everypony into a glomp pile on Dermathil
<prince-dari> Well it wasn't torture for me
<Saturn> 8,1that's not the point of watchign a B movie
<Moshakra> inb4 spark
<Ingwaz> RaveBrony: they were more than a match for it, the flim flam brothers had to cut their quality to crap to try and win
<Moshakra> =D
<Hazard_3_> she is PHSYCIC
<Phase4> still have to finish foe
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is pulled
<KernelCobb> what did she think was gonna happen? they were going to colide and cat fight?
<Moshakra> :d
<prince-dari> It was hilarious watching the chat and the film
<Mutterguy> what would have made sense is if they offered a flat fee to use it
<Moshakra> :)
<Ingwaz> honorary family members are still family members
<Moshakra> :(
<prince-dari> That's why I'm saying it's subjective.
<Saturn> 8,1oh, also, i don't think we have anything about WMC in the rules
<Moshakra> :[
<Shizuka> 13well.. epic movie is also the first one since... sepember, babes in toyland
<kirzstryfe> 1,3mallrats for the b movie
<Phase4> part way through foe-ph but i'm going to wait for it to finish
<Hazard_3_> lol that wouldve been epic
<Saturn> 8,1and we should put it in
*HeavyMetalDash glomps glompile
<Shizuka> 13to get wmc
<Tovler> I guess they'll go to one of the Apple Family's other farms and buy those out.
*Dermathil stands tall and carries the whole of bronystate chat on his shoulders.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well, i gotta go, Goodnight everyone!:)
*IshBestPony the gravitational pull of the glomp pile drags IshBestPony in
*Hydrazine is pulled in
*Dashie is smothered in glomps from glomp pile
<Hazard_3_> >:O
<Phase4> chats so busy
<Hazard_3_> :O
<fillyfillyy> NeverEatingCupcakesA what are you listening to?
<Dermathil> I vaguely remember ité
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos, that's more or less all i wanted to say
<Randomnerd> Bye, TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Hazard_3_> >:D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well, Goodnight everyone! See ya later~ :)
<WingedCurse> g'night tGaPT
<SlurryMoon> 3I've always seen B movies as low budget/low rating/cult film
<Moshakra> DEM EYES
<Phase4> gnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Jim> good night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> i have no idea what im listening to
<Hazard_3_> DAT FLANK
*Ingwaz begins running from teh gravitational glomp pull
<Moshakra> lol
<Saturn> 8,1aye, same here
<Moshakra> OPEN
<Moshakra> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH
<Hazard_3_> this is AWESOME!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3notes and chords
<Moshakra> xD
<Ingwaz> shes not gonna make it captain!
<RaveBrony> Ingwaz, Im saying like Before the other joined in to help :o and maybe the others see Flim and Flam trying to sabbotage stuff? idk
<Moshakra> the end
*Randomnerd puts hoof against the glomp pile affectionately
<Hazard_3_> ^_^
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> ah *facehoof*
<Ghosties> 04<@prince-dari> Battlefield Leverage bad is beautiful <-THAT TIMES A MILLION
<Saturn> 8,1my example earlier was that El Mariachi is a B, but is also considered one of the greatest movies of all time
<Moshakra> creepy spacedude
<RaveBrony> Whatever, episode is made, nothing i can do xD
<WingedCurse> dat thumbnail
<fillyfillyy> im listening to party with Pinkie (Living tombstone remix)
<Hazard_3_> :D
<Phase4> well i must go, got a dnd game and a pc to repair
<Dermathil> btw kirz, you just allowed me to say that I'm carrying all of bronystate chat on my shoulders. thanks!
<Moshakra> not a blank music video...
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> kool
<Phase4> later #BronyState
<Randomnerd> Have fun, Phase4
<Hazard_3_> omfg
<Moshakra> damn
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:)
<Yahooz> bye Phase4
<HeavyMetalDash> have fun Phase4
<OneTrickPony> bye Phase4
<Ouroboros> Take care Phase4
<Dashie> see ya phase
<Jim> bai Phase4
<Phase4> later #BronyStateRegulars
<Yahooz> ohey my first request :3
<KernelCobb> minecraft?
<Randomnerd> Ooh... Tomorrow is 40K Day :D
<Shizuka> 13for me it's the ones weren't good enough for A, like Hackers or The Core
<Moshakra> this beter be ponies
<LadyCanary> 40k day?
<Ingwaz> well RaveBrony, its an unfair set up, having a machine thats completely automated and capable of gathering, sorting, and producing cider in a very short time against 4 ponies, 1 a child and 1 an elderly mare
<Hazard_3_> it had better
*Mutterguy desperately scrambles away but is slowly dragged towards the glomptum singularity
<Hydrazine> whats that?
<Hazard_3_> if it isnt
<Saturn> 8,1i think that we shoudl word the rules such that people come up with El Mariachis as well as things like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter
<Ingwaz> thats hardly fair at all
<Dermathil> Just... keep staying off my lawn when I don't invite you on it, alright?
<Moshakra> oh okay.
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :l
<Hazard_3_> it dousnt deserve bronystate
<Randomnerd> I'm playing my brother in a game of Warhammer 40K
<Moshakra> flutterremix
<Hazard_3_> YES
*Dermathil waves his walking stick.
*Dashie still at bottom of glomp pile
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :|
<Ghosties> 04<@prince-dari> That's why I'm saying it's subjective. <-This is pretty right too. The whole point of B movies is that it's accepted, usually, as bad though I do know where Saturn is coming from
<Saturn> 8,1and... Manos: Hans of Fate
<KernelCobb> YES!
<WingedCurse> ah
<Hydrazine> -_-
<Hazard_3_> this is pretty good
<LadyCanary> Ah I see.
<OneTrickPony> Warhammer 40k is so expensive
<Dashie> OMG it's fluttershy remix
<Dermathil> Dashie, I'm at bottom. I'm carrying all the clomps.
*Luna passes out
<Moshakra> i could D'aww to this.
<Luna> 07,01Zzzz
<Saturn> 8,1aye, all i'm saying is we change the wording slightly
<Ghosties> 04Evil Dead II is loved by millions, but it's most certainly a B film
<Yahooz> XD
<RaveBrony> I understand, Ingwaz. Im just thinking about it too much thats all xD I get what i get and i shudnt mind a bit, right? :P
*kirzstryfe throws a frisbee on Dermathil's lawn
<Mutterguy> I use fancy words I do
<otakon> no
<Yahooz> sorry Luna
<otakon> must
<KernelCobb> *insta-sleep*
<Hazard_3_> if she was actually singing it
<otakon> resist
<otakon> sleep!
*IshBestPony glomps Fleur
<prince-dari> For example most people loved Blazing Saddles, where as I found it boring.
<WingedCurse> inb4 bass drops :D
<Dashie> I'm next to you ;)
<Randomnerd> I've been building an army for 8 years or so.
*Dermathil grabs it and throws it back.
*kirzstryfe naps
<fillyfillyy> NeverEatingCupcakesA Y U NO eat cupcakes ever again?
*HeavyMetalDash can't escape glompile despite years of moshpit training
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> im new here so how do you make the chat like an action
*Jim hands otakon coffee
<prince-dari> And Blazing Saddles is one of those 'amazing films' you're probably talking about
<Dermathil> See? No need to walk on my lawn.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Buying all of those ships and troops for WH40K is expensive.
<Saturn> 8,1yeah, i'm not contesting that it's subjective
<otakon> thanks Jim
<Hydrazine> that must be a huge army
<Luna> 07,01try /me txt
<kirzstryfe> 1,3./me
<Dermathil> hoofprints are bad for its proper growth.
<Randomnerd> Nope.
<Hazard_3_> whats everybodys fav pony?
<Dashie> I ran tyranids for 40K
<Ingwaz> man...i wish there were show accurate toys...
*Luna txt
*otakon chugs coffee......"HOT!"
<prince-dari> So you get all kind of movies out of it
<Ghosties> 04Well that's the magic of film, everybody has a different perspective on it so not everybody is going to consider A movie to be A and B movie to be B
<Saturn> 8,1but i think we need to make the intention B movies clearer
<KernelCobb> spike
<RaveBrony> :o
<Randomnerd> It's 1500 points. We played small armies for a while
<otakon> Ingwaz: you and everyone else
<Hazard_3_> lol
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> fillyfillyy watch the fanfic "Cupcakes" and you'll know why
*Ingwaz facehoofs otakon
<OneTrickPony> one figurine is $45
<LadyCanary> And thats why you dont chug HOT COFFEE otakon
<Hazard_3_> Ditzy Doo
<Jim> Thanks!
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> All ponies are best pony
<Ghosties> 04We try to
<prince-dari> But the intention is different to different people.
<Moshakra> ditzy???
<Jim> oh, you were talking about the coffee
<Shizuka> 13blazing saddles was also supposed to be B
<fillyfillyy> i know i loved that one
<Moshakra> lol
<Moshakra> fail
<Mutterguy> my cousins play it
<Ingwaz> i figured id do it for you, since you seem to be in need of a good facehoo
*NeverEatingCupcakesA derps
<Hazard_3_> shes awesome
<Ingwaz> hoof*
<prince-dari> To you it's only so bad it's good
<fillyfillyy> :O:D
<Saturn> 8,1my specific objection is the wording "generally considered bad"
<KernelCobb> how dare you call her ditzy doo
<Moshakra> derpy -.-
<Ghosties> 04There's more then just "generally bad" for B film descrition
<Hazard_3_> second is pinkie :D
<fillyfillyy> muahahahaha
<prince-dari> For me it's also just HORRIBLE films too.
<Ghosties> 04*description
<Dermathil> Nittany, I prefer just holding my collector 3rd edition Space Hulk board game.
<Dermathil> :3
<KernelCobb> how DARE YOU:[
<otakon> bufff I LICFF hotff coffeeee
<Hazard_3_> come ooonnn
<Ingwaz> if there were actual show accurate toys, they'd sell a lot better
<Randomnerd> OneTrickPony: See, I don't play special characters... I spend $40 for squads of old minis
<Hazard_3_> thats her real name
<Moshakra> no it isn't
<OneTrickPony> oh
<fillyfillyy> my freind did a really good reading of itt
<Ghosties> 04We tried to set objective reasons for why a B film is B
<Hazard_3_> but if u want derpy its derpy :3
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> but the fanfic was definittley not nightmare material
<KernelCobb> phffftttaafffttfftt
<Dermathil> Ingwaz: return of the mcdonald ponies
<Ghosties> 04Such as budget cost
<Dermathil> they're coming back
<KernelCobb> rainbow called her derpy
<Dermathil> and they're gonna be awesome again.
<Randomnerd> I play an IG army... they get you with TANKS.
<Ingwaz> indeed Dermathil, and i will be buying several of each one each week
<HeavyMetalDash> aww yeah I get mine free!!!
<Hazard_3_> yeah forgot
<Moshakra> it was a name of a random backround pony, so she just filled derpys body for it that episode
<Jim> Call upon the McPonies when you're in distress
<Shizuka> 13amendment to clarifying the A/B distinction (as i understand it, AGAIN), should probably make the six month encore and four week ineligible vote rules clearer/more visible
<KernelCobb> i'm sorry, but admins, we need to show this guy the derpy-sode
<OneTrickPony> I used to play Warhammer 40k, but then I took an imperial army to the Tyranids
<Moshakra> her official name is derpy now that she's canon
<Ingwaz> i'm also monitoring local walmarts to see when they might get new blindbags in
<Randomnerd> lol OneTrickPony
*NeverEatingCupcakesA gets made ino a cupcake
<Hazard_3_> good
<fillyfillyy> rainbow factory and rocket to insanity MUAHAHA more
<Moshakra> i wouldn't mind the derpy-sode myself
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> true
<Hazard_3_> sounds good
<Ingwaz> i checked the one that had some last night, seems theyve been sold or removed
<NullRadix> ... or... my computer will freeze forcing a restart, killing previously noted notepad document and the other document I was parsing this program flow into...
<KernelCobb> i vote derpy-sode
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's still considered not very pony, and not a topic for bronystate :p
<Dashie_Dashie> Everypony, I need halp.
<Moshakra> too bad he doens't watch chat
<Hazard_3_> as do i
<OneTrickPony> I was also terrible at the game
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> true...
<Dermathil> yeah. the rules forbid discussion of it
<Dashie> what's up Dashie_Dashie?
<Dashie_Dashie> I need to find a sound clip for "Deal or no Deal"
<Moshakra> or at least the normal chat
<Dashie> oh
<OneTrickPony> Dashie_Dashie wut is the problem?
<Dermathil> just like... *shivers* spiderseses.
<fillyfillyy> of those fanfics?
<Hazard_3_> >.>
<Dashie_Dashie> where he just ask's the simple "Deal or no deal"
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :( k
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<OneTrickPony> oh
<KernelCobb> they watch for spam
<Hazard_3_> the spam vultures
<Moshakra> Yeah, but taht isn't the streamer
<Jim> uhm..Tried youtube?
<KernelCobb> so they know what we are saying
<Dashie_Dashie> youtube is dry
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Are we allowed to post videos that are not on CorporateTube?
<Ghosties> 04We could probably put it on our site somewhere
<fillyfillyy> so no talking of those fanfics then
<Ghosties> 04Or in our rules
<kirzstryfe> 1,3ugh, I've had Vi quoting spiderseses over skype for the last few days >.<
<Jim> hmm, I don't know then
<OneTrickPony> try soundcloud
<Yahooz> Ummm idk?
<Dermathil> hahaha kirz
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> .
<KernelCobb> mod, plz contact the streamer
<Dermathil> poor thing you.
<IshBestPony> sorry Kira
<Dashie_Dashie> youtube gives me 10 minute vids
<Hazard_3_> this is an epic song
<Yahooz> Are we?
<Dashie_Dashie> I just need a 3 second clip @_@
<RawketLawnchair> This music.
<Ingwaz> so far i only have 3 wave 1 blind bag ponies, none of them the mane 6
<Dashie> you could go on youtube and use an onlie video downloader todownlod it as sound format
<RawketLawnchair> What is this music?
<Shizuka> 13i think the four week thing is in the rules, but it's buried in that paragraph
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> i have never heard of spiderseses, and i will never want to.
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: take the video and extract teh sound clip from it
<Randomnerd> I have a calender, lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I assume that the 4-week exclusion category would be for one slot of the lottery.
<Shizuka> 13but i'll bring that up more in the techie meeting when i talk content specifics for BS2.0
<Ghosties> 04If it is, we should make it its own paragraph
<RawketLawnchair> I must know this music.
<fillyfillyy> now im listening to party with pinkie non remixed
<Dashie> it's a fluttersy remix
<SaxyPretender> 0,14QUick suggestion, sorry to interrupt, but maybe techies could put up something in the backlog to indicate whether or not somehting is eligble to be re-picked when BS2.0 launcheds?
<Moshakra> eh, i'm bored
<WingedCurse> use a youtube downloader, than convert the file into an mp3 or something
<kirzstryfe> 1,3but yeah, if you haven't had a chance yet, our rules are at www.bronystate.net/rules
<Dashie> *fluttershy
<KernelCobb> or maybe i'm just noob and there is somewhere where we request...like...vinyl scratch room
<Yahooz> Pinkie Pie Swear: Hush Now Quite Now (Lucid Dream Mix) RawketLawnchair
<Dermathil> ^^
<otakon> yeah
<Ghosties> 04They do
<Shizuka> 13SaxyPretender: http://du.cx/shizuka/?page_id=96 done

<RawketLawnchair> Ah.
<Saturn> 8,1SaxyPretender: shizu's already done that
<fillyfillyy> ive read them
<Randomnerd> Some guys have supermodels on their wall, I have ponies.
<Yahooz> And your welcome
<Ghosties> 04They have that for the list
<Dashie> wait no
<RawketLawnchair> I like it.
<Dashie> pinkie pie
<Ghosties> 04What Shizu just put up
<RawketLawnchair> Thank you, broski.
<Hazard_3_> lol
<Moshakra> You gotta request in the bronystate room
<otakon> then use a audio program to cut the sound out
<SaxyPretender> 0,14K, gotcha.
<Yahooz> NP
<Hazard_3_> :0
<RawketLawnchair> Also, is VioletVanilla doing her Radio show?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I assume that's a no...
<Yahooz> Yes
<Yahooz> This week she is
<KernelCobb> :O*
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Dang...
<Dashie> confused myself because I have fluttershy remix on a tab

<prince-dari> Ahahaha.
<RawketLawnchair> Ah, neat.
<Ghosties> 04I know right
<Dermathil> was written on the specific purpose of being the worst fic ever.
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> i reading da rules right nao
<RawketLawnchair> Well, I ought to go get myself some dinner.
<Hazard_3_> IT BETTER NOT BE
<Moshakra> when did she say that>?

<Hazard_3_> oh god
<NullRadix> ... apparently I hit Ctrl+S at some point so i didn't lose *everything*...
<Ghosties> 04Clint Flutewood

<SuperBrony64> 10,02MY BRAIN IS MELTING
<Moshakra> TACTICAL MUTE INBOUND
<Yahooz> This is like the only PMV that I actually like :3
<prince-dari> Is C just for the worst films?
<Hazard_3_> NICE
<Ghosties> 04Alright, so, what's next in the meeting?
<Hazard_3_> its synced!
<Ghosties> 04And yeah, C is for WMC material
<fillyfillyy> is those 2 fanfics under the innapropriate for caht catagory?
<KernelCobb> very well
<Moshakra> there's lots liek that
<Moshakra> are you a new brony or something
<prince-dari> Spider's Web didn't get WMCed.
<prince-dari> :>
<fillyfillyy> chat*
<KernelCobb> who?
<Hazard_3_> no
<Luna> 07,01PROJECTS & PARTNERSHIPS:
<Luna> 07,01- team input (Do you have any possible partners for us in mind? if so which and why? how can we contact them?
<Ghosties> 04That's because some people found it enjoyable
<Hazard_3_> im new to the chat
<Moshakra> meh
<Luna> 07,01this one is short
<Dashie> epic mlp music video is epic
<Luna> 07,01we're almost done btw
<Moshakra> these are all on youtube
<Hazard_3_> i know
<HeavyMetalDash> are you two like the only ones here?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Indeed it is
<Hazard_3_> >.>
<Moshakra> you can spend hours watching this
<Dermathil> I know an amv with this exact song that I prefer way more... but it isn't pony.
<Randomnerd> PMVs aren't so great, the more I think about 'em. Shoehorning in footage to music rarely ends well.
<Moshakra> there's more, they're just asleep from that last song
<Hazard_3_> yeah :D
<Dermathil> kinda
<KernelCobb> trixie ^.^
*Fleur comes back from new ep and notices that someone pinged her. Is Wrek awake!? :D
<Kencolt> THis ends well.
<fillyfillyy> ok
<Moshakra> fail
<Hazard_3_> trixie is cool
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> So, Twilight is the messiah...I knew it
<WingedCurse> scroll down a lil bit?
*Randomnerd glares at AMVs for all possible Pairings...
<Moshakra> :$
<LadyCanary> Not that I can see Fleur. And twas not I who pinged you
<Yahooz> I think he might be Fleur...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Artists maybe?
<Moshakra> :#
*IshBestPony glomps Fleur
<Moshakra> i hate this song -.-
<Yahooz> idk though
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh I know! EQD!
<Yahooz> dat IshBestPony
<Hazard_3_> this song is annoying
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I take it EqD is out of the question...
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I like it
<KernelCobb> Only tolerable because of ponies
<Luna> 07,01hah..
<Jim> Wrek isn't awake yet I think
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<Hazard_3_> yup
<LordCelestia> 0,5;3
<Moshakra> mute ftw
<ValtheJean> it's not so much out of the question
<Hazard_3_> and hippies
<Hazard_3_> and thats not saying much
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> But that's just my opinion
<ValtheJean> so much as every time we TRY to be nice to them, they give us the middle finger
*Fleur scrolled up and noticed that it was just IshBestPony glomping me while I wasnt here
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In what way?
<KernelCobb> Pegusus sideways tornado
<Moshakra> obviously
<Dashie> :c the rainbow_dash chat doesn't appreciate this pmv
<HeavyMetalDash> d'aaw Filly Twi
<ValtheJean> example:
<KernelCobb> coolest thing ever
<Hazard_3_> lol
<LordCelestia> 0,5What about animators like MrPoniator who actually come to Bronystate? Thats cool
<Ghosties> 04They screw us over in our email
<Hazard_3_> is it playing dif vid yet?
<fluttercry> 05,15Well actually on the EqD note, I feel like we should try and get our own post back. Find out what the deal between us is.
<Ghosties> 04They lump us in with every other pony stream
<kirzstryfe> 1,3a general rule of thumb is if it would run contrary to the spirit of MLP, or it's something they wouldn't put into an episode of Family Guy, then it's probably not chat appropriate
<ValtheJean> you know how (what is it, Bronychat?) that radio thing gets adverts on eqd?
<KernelCobb> no
<Moshakra> dat angle
<SuperBrony64> 10,02By grouping us with other streams and classifying outselves as a 'Marathon'
<Moshakra> xD
<Hazard_3_> shit
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<LordCelestia> 0,5You know, MrPoniator? The guy who makes the cool animations?
<Kencolt> Get ready for amazing stuff...
<ValtheJean> we ASKED them how we could get on that site
<Moshakra> i like that effect
<HeavyMetalDash> calm down the song aint that bad
<ValtheJean> and he basically said we were a one-trick pony
<Hazard_3_> OBJECTION
<Saturn> 8,1can i just ask, why are we trying to get away from EqD?
<KernelCobb> love and tolerate
<Moshakra> i'm not upset to begin with -.-
<Dashie> so many rainbooms
<Saturn> 8,1wouldn't it be beneficial to work with them?
<Hazard_3_> dont hate!
<WingedCurse> great video editing
<ValtheJean> and then a month or so later, OH LOOK, there's a radio thing advertising on EqD
<Saturn> 8,1they're pretty massive
<fillyfillyy> ok wait should i not read spiderseses though
<Moshakra> love and tolerate people, not terrible music xD
<Ghosties> 04BECAUSE WE'RE REBELLIOUS! *runs away crying and slams the door*
<Hazard_3_> exactly lolwut
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Because EqD is the DEVIL /waterboy
<KernelCobb> no, no, no this song sucks
<Dashie> I need to go favourite this video, brb every pony
<KernelCobb> i was just sayin
<Hazard_3_> guys
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's written extremely poorly, and I mean extremely poorly
<Ghosties> 04We're like the rookie to their pro
*IshBestPony cuddles up next to Fleur
<Ghosties> 04Or some shit
<Moshakra> and i was just typin.
<Ghosties> 04Basically, we shouldn't be EqD
<Ghosties> 04We need to be US
<Hazard_3_> can i make a suggestion?
<Dermathil> also, spidertwilight.
<prince-dari> Because we don't want to be reliant on them.
<fillyfillyy> worse than Im nut ok i promiss
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We like Rainbow Dash, they like Trixie, we just can't coexist.
<KernelCobb> dat correction
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> It could be a lot worse (most of today's music, specifically rap and hip-hop, for example)
<Dermathil> it is frightening.
<SlurryMoon> 3Remember MrEvergreen and co.'s game that me, SB, and LC are now taking part in? We could partner up with them to help create a game under the BronyState name. Just a thought.
<prince-dari> Because they let us down
<Moshakra> this is epic with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo__1A-XR0c&feature=related
<prince-dari> consistantly.
<LordCelestia> 0,5So no one on board for animators like MrPoniator?
<LadyCanary> This is some AWESOME editING. Makes me even more proud of this fandom.
<Dermathil> Twilight and spiderbabies.
<ValtheJean> oh, speaking of partnerships
<Moshakra> around the 3 minutes mark
<Dermathil> ...
<Yahooz> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02SlurryMoon: I was actually going to mention about that at the end of the meeting
<ValtheJean> whatever happened to the Fighting is Magic people?
<Ghosties> 04Was about to say, LC, can you show us some of his work?
<Saturn> 8,1i'm not saying be reliant on them, i'm saying let them help us and let us help the
*SlurryMoon nods
<Saturn> 8,1*them
<ValtheJean> they mentioned having us stream shit for them, but then they disappeared
<Moshakra> aww that synced perfectly
<SlurryMoon> 3Okay then SB
<fluttercry> 05,15Val maybe you should talk about your flash game idea, get that made and posted around.
<Ghosties> 04We've TRIED to get them to help us
<LordCelestia> 0,5Oh god yes, his animations are cool
<Kencolt> And that's why I request it every time I can.
<Ghosties> 04But they don't
<Hazard_3_> how about...Pinkies Lie!
<KernelCobb> BIDE
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ill link you in a sec Ghosties
<Moshakra> xD
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<KernelCobb> all hail luna
<fillyfillyy> is it worse than im nut ok i promiss
<Hazard_3_> by woodentoaster!
<ValtheJean> after the meeting, I'll talk about it in SRS
<Dermathil> yes it is way worse.
<Randomnerd> In #vinyl_scratch
<Scoot-Scootaloo> There's always fan-fiction writers and musicians..
<ValtheJean> since I don't think people want to chat about it here
<Saturn> 8,1i can see there's anymosity between us and them, but maybe we should look into getting past that and getting something good going
<WingedCurse> ^
<ValtheJean> so just be on the lookout for that
<Moshakra> d'aww at fluttershys
<HeavyMetalDash> the one princess too rule them all
<fillyfillyy> ok den
<Saturn> 8,1i mean, we're all bronies, right?
<Ghosties> 04NO
<Moshakra> fluttershy has a goatee
<Ghosties> 04Well maybe
<Moshakra> xD
<Ghosties> 04I dunno
<kirzstryfe> 1,3"It was a beutiful spring daty in equestrias when tilight sparkle was in her study where she lived."
<Luna> 07,01that's the problem Saturn...
<Luna> 07,01we tried
<kirzstryfe> 1,3opening line
<prince-dari> Ty's definition of brony is different to yous.

<KernelCobb> wait
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<KernelCobb> WAT
<Ghosties> 04I'm the anti-brony
<LordCelestia> 0,5Ghosties, MrPoniator is the guy who makes the short animations of ponies. You may have seen some of them. http://www.youtube.com/user/MrPoniator
<Hazard_3_> wtf?
<Moshakra> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Could we get artists on board somehow?
<KernelCobb> why does she have facial hair
<ValtheJean> believe me saturn, you have no idea how much EqD ass I have kissed
<WingedCurse> dead stream and chat?
<Luna> 07,01^

<Ghosties> 04And we already have some artists on board
<Hydrazine> nah, just quiet

<LadyCanary> Who requested this amazing trippy video.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02From their perspective, they see us just as a 'streaming site' and as such don't deserve our own post anymore.
<Randomnerd> I don't know, I really liked it
<WingedCurse> alice in wonderland on japanese drugs?

<Kira_Pony_Yamato> the heck?
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> oh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Brief side note thing, (and I can wait till general) but I noticed on the forums and just now about contacting the Fighting is Magic, what was the idea behind that? I have something forumlating in my mind...

<LadyCanary> Why do I LOVE IT so much.
<Shizuka> 13mrponiator is around sometimes, was just last night i think, but not quite as often as the rest of the regs, probably just due to life
<Ghosties> 04Eh, if you think he'd like to help I don't see why not giving him a shout
<Yahooz> lag?
<OneTrickPony> lag
<otakon> wth IS THIS!?
<WingedCurse> laggy
<meh> catchy music?
<Moshakra> is it frozen for you guys?
<Kimori> hey
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Celestia, save me!
<Moshakra> nvm,

<HeavyMetalDash> that chest was full of freindship!
<Kencolt> sudden freeze frame...
<Hazard_3_> not really
<Dermathil> >mfw I recognize Vissia's name in here
<Randomnerd> Raritycatchme!
<IshBestPony> I agree with otakon, what is this
<otakon> Kencolt: what IS THIS? I don't even
<Tovler> There's a prequel to this, but it's over 5 minutes long.
<LadyCanary> ...mfw I actually know the artist of this video.
<Sheepy> Remeber kids, drugs are bad, you'll end up like the person in the video
<Moshakra> i said nvm -.-
<SuperBrony64> 10,02That sums up how my mind feels right now.
<Moshakra> what the
<LadyCanary> Takashi Murakami.
<OneTrickPony> om nom nom
<prince-dari> SaxyPretender: We had contact with the team making Fighing is Magic a while back
<Hazard_3_> this isnt ponys!
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> .....
<Jim> I'm still not entirely sure what's going on.
<WingedCurse> ^SB64 XD
<Moshakra> really?
<Ingwaz> the crap is this?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: agreed, let us never speak of that again
<KernelCobb> no this is totally ponies
<Yahooz> alright
<KernelCobb> japanese ponies?
<prince-dari> Were working out streaming previews of the game for them, and streaming a tournement when it first came out
<Ghosties> 04Speaking of Fighting is Magic, we had ideas and stuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish FimFlamFilosopher would answer me back. We had a bit of a conversation going months back, but he stopped answering my Youtube PMS.
<Tovler> And that's how luggage is made.
<Sheepy> French?
<Saturn> 8,1well, if we could get some big brony names on board and featured on BS2.0, then i think we've got a pretty good chance of gaining a foothold
<Hazard_3_> must have taken 10 hours to get the shading on the eyes right
<LadyCanary> Takashi Murakami, YOU ARE AMAZING
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*PMs
<IshBestPony> I agree with Ingwaz, what is this
<prince-dari> But then they just went and streamed a preview on their owns.
<otakon> (Scout)That did NOT just happen!
<Moshakra> that's probably derpys dreams
<Randomnerd> ^
<Yahooz> XD
<prince-dari> So that kind of put that to rest.
<Ghosties> 04And they never got back in touch with us
<Yahooz> this
<meh> lol
<Moshakra> yay
<Dermathil> .....
<Hazard_3_> sweet
<Moshakra> that's better
<otakon> oh hell yah!
<Ghosties> 04So either they forgot about us or I dunno
<Ingwaz> hmm....this could be win

<Jim> Mlp: Turn based combat is magic
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> THIS IS WIN!
<Ingwaz> it does a bit Randomnerd
<LadyCanary> ...Oh baby.

<otakon> dinner is ready
<kyle0113> How are you?
<meh> shes freaking me out
<Hazard_3_> pony should pony pony :P
<ValtheJean> well, there's no harm in trying again
<Ghosties> 04I don't exactly see the problem in it
<Tovler> Takashi Murakami was inspiration for Summer Wars movie.
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: i dont think anything can compete with classic mega man music
<ValtheJean> just remember they've already ditched us before
<Luna> 07,01just keep us involved :)
<Luna> 07,01okay shall I move on?
<Dermathil> Tovler: I could totally see the similarities.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> I talked to navybrony a couple of days ago, and he we're actually cool with each other! Maybe I can get him involved
<Ingwaz> that stuff is orgasmic
<Scoot-Scootaloo> and do go on.

<VioletVanilla> 06As far as partnerships go, und any sort of contact, something I have learned from several other sites. Constantly email. The only way we get interviews is to show we are serious, the only way we show we are serious is by being curteous und straightforward. Its how all of the major sites are in contact with writers/producers/etc. of FiM. They find ways to contact them. Same way with getting
<WingedCurse> hunchback for A movie?
<VioletVanilla> 6our name out there und getting others to know us. The only way to know somepony ist to start a connection.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heard that some parents sent Hasbro letters criticizing them over Derpy.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I know of one person, but he hasn't answered me back.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: well, there was somebody on MLB who tried to say "Derpy" was an ableist slur against the mentally retarded, and that the show using that name made them ashamed of the fandom.

<SkilledSkillet> Wha-what happened?
<Dashie> dramatic pause
<Shizuka> 13dari has corrected me, apparently Spider's Web was not actually WMC'd
<Kimori> ah

<RaveBrony> O.o
<Tovler> SuperBrony64 has never heard the song Rainbow Factory?
<Moshakra> no, just drama
<Yahooz> not cupcakes
<JTDrift> well. look at it like this, if you didn't know what Rainbow Factory was, would you really be that traumatized by this vid?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Too risky, skipping it.
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> ??
<Hazard_3_> haha
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :[
<Garden-of-Sound> Didn't the guy who nominated Spider's Web get banned?
<RaveBrony> Aww

<SkilledSkillet> Wow simplicity at its finest

<LordCelestia> 0,5I have a question
<Hazard_3_> princess molestia is exited!

<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Sb has the floor now, no doubt taking his time
<Ghosties> 04VioletVanilla is the best VioletVanilla in the world
<Kimori> I realized that it works real well with my class schedule
<Midnight_Tempest> i find the lack of taco's in this chat disturbing...
<Dermathil> it was on bronystate so it counts.
<Moshakra> oh god
<otakon> Dermathil: it does NOT
<Hazard_3_> lolwut?
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> :D
<Yahooz> RAWRity's

<Shizuka> 13i just linked it..
<pony_8295> please put on ponys
<Hazard_3_> they have perminantly changed the streaming game
<pony_8295> D:
<otakon> I had to rejoin
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, let me bring up two things...
<Shizuka> 13http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog
<otakon> thank you
<Dermathil> we need a mod to verify whether mod picks are subject to the 6-month clause
<OneTrickPony> time to go play Skyrim
<otakon> correct Dermathil
<otakon> I don't think it would be fair if it is
<Moshakra> lol
<kirzstryfe> 1,3requests are put in by users, not all of them end up being pony
<WingedCurse> wtf is the last airbender doing on A list?
<Garden-of-Sound> wait, is SB still taking requests?
<Kencolt> We aren't entirely about ponies here. We're also about crazy, about happiness, about good music, and about movies that never existed.
<Hazard_3_> ok
<otakon> WingedCurse: no idea
<RAWRity> WingedCurse: it's a high budget movie. A and B are not marks of quality one way or the other
<otakon> Kencolt speaks the truth
<Moshakra> hazard, he can't hear you
<NullRadix> WingedCurse: marketed as an A movie, but B movie quality
<derpsalot> my skyrim broke so i turned to renturning to being a brony so thats why im here lol
<Hazard_3_> can u do Princess Molestia Is Exited?
<Yahooz> XD Who is the troll who edited Lion King into the backlog?
<Moshakra> it's just a post by mods that goes in all chats
<SuperBrony64> 10,02First, there is a project that is being done by MrEvergreen (you might have seen him frequent a number of IRC channels). Me, SlurryMoon, and LordCelestia are a part of that team in helping to design an RPG Pony game.
<otakon> derpsalot: get new skyrim!
<RaveBrony> Lol?
<RAWRity> Yahooz: nobody. we watched it a while back.
<otakon> Yahooz: it was a mod pick
<WingedCurse> titan A.E. :o
<Yahooz> ah
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, I'm not a bot :p
<Hazard_3_> oh well lolwut
<Yahooz> I see
<NeverEatingCupcakesA> bai
<Kimori> It can be turned into a full time job if I got better at it
<Midnight_Tempest> you know what would make an awesome A movie... Dark City
<Moshakra> this song isn't that mad though
<RaveBrony> :P
<Moshakra> oh =s
<Kimori> but I just do it as a hobby
<derpsalot> i was done anyways
<Garden-of-Sound> RAWRity, does that still mean that classic films like 12 Angry Men which are low budget would be counted as B movies?
<Hazard_3_> YES IT IS
<Dermathil> otakon: it wouldn't be fair to the mods who chose their movies. They weren't chosen by the lottery but it was a special event. So even then I'd see it as counting.
<Critchley> the bot speaks
<RAWRity> Garden-of-Sound: technically, yes.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3unless I'm programmed to respond like that :3
<Moshakra> oh wiat
<Moshakra> oh, it'
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/220943467729?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649

<Jim> bluestrom_S: *
<Hazard_3_> CONVINCE IT
<kirzstryfe> 1,3<3 :D
<Kimori> I can show you some stuff I have listed
<Moshakra> sorry kirs, mistook you for an actualy bot
<Moshakra> xD
<SuperBrony64> 10,02He would like to form some sort of partnership with BronyState in hopes of gaining support with his game as well as raise awareness. In exchange, I believe we will have 'publishing' rights to it (need to confirm).
<Dermathil> hey EspyLacopa
<GabeMoist> Let's watch Buckaroo Banzai again
<Critchley> bot will you be my friend <3
<NullRadix> A) When in doubt, ask a mod
<EspyLacopa> Morning Dermathil.
<Moshakra> i forgot the name
<RAWRity> A and B are not about quality, it's about budget and popularity.
<NullRadix> B) Mod positions may change at any given time
<kirzstryfe> 1,3must be that soul I'm lacking >.>
<otakon> nevermind
<Mr> lol
<Ghosties> 04Who will have publishing rights to it?

<Hazard_3_> can u do Princess Molestia is excited?
<Moshakra> o.o
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I want to say us as we'll be helping to support the game
*kirzstryfe noms Critchley's soul
<otakon> damn, why so long though?
<Garden-of-Sound> RAWRity, surely if a low budget film was incredibly popular and well known it would count as an A then?
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> O_O
<Kimori> k
<EspyLacopa> Like Rocky Horror Picture Show.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Please let it be indie. Please let it be indie.*

*HeavyMetalDash seizure
<Hazard_3_> haha
<Mr> lol
<Kimori> ill put a couple of things on every week
<otakon> SkilledSkillet: taht is....a odd word phonetically
<WingedCurse> wow, those MLP HP's were hoaxes
<Kimori> pay some of the bills
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So, what do you all think? Something you'd be interested in discussing it further? He seems very excited at the prospect of partnering with us.
<Garden-of-Sound> eww World of Warcraft
<RawketLawnchair> http://i42.tinypic.com/300qjcl.jpg Oh hey, this is pretty neat.
<Dashie> SKilledSkillet: O U
<Kencolt> It's a 12 chapter long epic-- and I men epic in both dark and hilarity.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Right to a pony game. Things just get better and better.
*IshBestPony begins using his gravitational pull to pull everypony into a glomp pile
<NullRadix> just change Pandaren to Horde, and Ponies to Alliance next expac
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would.
<Moshakra> ITS SO ADORABLE I CANT TAKE IT
<otakon> not the glomp!
<Hazard_3_> ME NIETHER
<NullRadix> everyone wins
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just to get involved.
<Mr> ^
<Ghosties> 04...dear god, this looks complicated
<EspyLacopa> Kencolt: What would the Pony mounts be?
<GabeMoist> everyone loses
<Jim> is that spanish?
<prince-dari> [01:10] <prince-dari> So the game will only be available from our site or what?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02However, please note, the game is still in the Alpha stages as the team is currently small.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/220943451357?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649
<prince-dari> [01:09] <Ghosties> What will we get for publishing rights besides exclusivity? Cameos, etc.?
<Moshakra> Look at the username
<Stargazer> speaking of ponies and WoW there was a pretty funny thread about pony mounts lately. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941586552
*Ghosties drools at the thought of the game becoming a worldwide hit with BronyState as the publisher
<otakon> EspyLacopa: dragons ofc
<JTDrift> yes its spanish
<prince-dari> [01:09] <prince-dari> So what does he want from us in return
<Hazard_3_> lolwut
<derpsalot> adorable
*HeavyMetalDash stops seizuring
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> *squee squee squee*
<VioletVanilla> 06Your soul.
<Garden-of-Sound> that was awesome
<HeavyMetalDash> is it over yet?
*Midnight_Tempest makes his gravity equal to IshBestPony and escapes the glomp
*Jim is welcoming the glomp pile
<Hazard_3_> NO
<VioletVanilla> 06Oh no, he wants something more. . .
<OJPhoenix> EspyLacopa: Tank
<kirzstryfe> 1,3no outside links please Stargazer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh please don't let BronyState go public.
<VioletVanilla> 06He wants..
<Moshakra> my life is over.
<EspyLacopa> Engineer Pinkie.
<VioletVanilla> 06A MEETING
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<VioletVanilla> 06WITH YOU
<HeavyMetalDash> XD
<Stargazer> whoops
<Hazard_3_> hahaha
<Kencolt> They don't have mounts-- until level 60, Like Worgen they just lear4n to run faster. Actually, a bit faster than anyone else-- it's a racial.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02He wants to use our fanbase to gain awareness of his game and gather more people to work on it
*IshBestPony increases his gravity and pulls Midnight_Tempest in
<VioletVanilla> 06I was a part of Bronystate before it became manestream~
<Ghosties> 04OH NOES, NOT ANOTHER MEETING
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Fanbase meaning 'BronyState viewers'
*VioletVanilla pushes up glases
<Yahooz> ...
<IshBestPony> There is no escape
<Ghosties> 04Hah
<pony_9547> search flutterstep on youtube for more adorableness :D
<prince-dari> Another meeting?
<Ghosties> 04I don't see a problem with that
<prince-dari> I'd rather die
<prince-dari> :D
*Hydrazine gets pulled into the pile
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<Luna> 07,01lawl
*Midnight_Tempest collapses in on himself and pull IshBestPony into his own glomp pile
<SlurryMoon> 3x3
<Hazard_3_> i heard that
<Moshakra> trust me i can't stop
<Hazard_3_> amazing
<HeavyMetalDash> I think one Seizure is enough for now
<derpsalot> how do you do that6_9
<VioletVanilla> 06Ghosties sees no problem
*Dashie notices sudden change in gravity
<VioletVanilla> 06ARE YOU INSANE???
<VioletVanilla> 06;A;
<Ghosties> 04I mean, if he wants to use our fanbase to gain awareness and help then awesome
<Dashie> oh shi- no no no no
<prince-dari> So what you mean by we'll be the publishers?
<Hazard_3_> YES
<Moshakra> oh god
<prince-dari> What does that mean for us?
<Yahooz> indeed they do youtube
*IshBestPony increases his gravity to remain the center of the glomp pile
<Hazard_3_> oh how they do!
<Sparkwarning> ahahaha
*GabeMoist trains in the increased gravity
*kirzstryfe tackle-glomps everypony attempting to escape back into the glomp pile
<Ghosties> 04That makes it a primary BronyState IP
<Moshakra> lol that lag ruined it
<Kencolt> Twilight's an Arcane Mage-- once she trains up, and an Archology freak. Rainbow dash is a Ret paladin, who prefers PvP. Fluttershy is, as I said, a Restoration Druid... so che can help critters.
<TrixieMuffin> Chariots like in the first episode , or Flying Carpets might work for ponys
<SuperBrony64> 10,02^

<zeppony> the only difference between #brony and #bronystate
<Hazard_3_> what in the world
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Anyway, as some of you probably DON'T know, there's a channel on IRC that's dedicated to Netherland Bronies (*looks at Luna*) #broniesnl , they are planning on having a meetup February 4th...
<derpsalot> ponymon
<Ghosties> 04IT'S NOT OVER
<Kencolt> What the...
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> This song caused mass-suicides in Japan...
<RaveBrony> ._.
<ScootaChicken> well, most of the time I can
<LordCelestia> 0,5THis random talk is, well, random
<zeppony> is that #brony has way fewer rules. that's it
<otakon> eeyup
<IshBestPony> not sure if want
<SkilledSkillet> I don't understand what reference am I missing here?
<Dashie> oh god, lavender town was the creepiest game town ever when I was a youn fillie
<Mr> this song haunts me...
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> At least that's what I heard..
<zeppony> of course, that leads to cultural differences as well
<prince-dari> Oh
<Sparkwarning> ahaha
<VioletVanilla> 06I knew this SB.
<prince-dari> You mentioned this
<Hazard_3_> ikr
<Dashie> *young
<Kimori> its fun but challenging
<JTDrift> can someone tell me what is bad about this song?
<Sparkwarning> this song is kinda depressing....
<otakon> well that too
<Scoot-Scootaloo> eeyup
<prince-dari> Earlier in Skype
<prince-dari> Or someone did
<VioletVanilla> 06I have been in all of those rooms <3 continue~
<ScootaChicken> I remember reading a creepypasta about Lavender Town
<otakon> JTDrift: ghost pokemon
<Hazard_3_> no shit O_O
<Kencolt> Well... I dunno about the brony thing, never been there...
<Hazard_3_> ;)
<Mr> have you read the creepy pasta about it?
<Kimori> when your in college youl deal with some classes that you have to pass if you want to graduate
<KernelCobb> ponies cancel that out
<IshBestPony> JTDrift its just depressing
<ScootaChicken> that was some scary shiz ;___;
<Jim> There's this creepypasta thingy about this, don't read it
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They were first interested in streaming our livestream of the Pony Episode while even offering to mention us if we setup a private stream page for them.
<Dashie> the cemetary building was cool though
<SuperBrony64> 10,02HOWEVER
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Supposivly it caused mass-suicides
<Sparkwarning> Nah gimme link?
<pony_8295> I hum this song whenever im in a cemetary
<VioletVanilla> 06OH!
<Hazard_3_> :'(
<JTDrift> ah! to kikis to find out horror goodness!
<VioletVanilla> 06I remember this
<ScootaChicken> actually, there's probably about ten million Lavender Town creepypastas
<Hazard_3_> lolnice
<JTDrift> wikis*
<WingedCurse> there is supposedly a high pitched sound that hurt kids ears, nothing more
<Dashie> ah 1st gen pokemon, how we love you so. :3
<pony_8295> I was doing it at my granfathers funeral
<pony_8295> by accident
<Critchley> <3
<Hazard_3_> uh oh
<pony_8295> i got smacked
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They are now also interested in if we would like to stream their event for a while with over 100 bronies going crazy (and possibly going nuts over BronyState).
<prince-dari> What do they even want on a private stream page?
<Hazard_3_> where?
<OneTrickPony> wow this quest is easy
<pony_8295> in the knee
<pony_8295> with an arrow
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I still play first-gen pokemon from time to time
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Just the stream and maybe their name or something.
<Hazard_3_> haha
<IshBestPony> all the tea
<derpsalot> lol
<Dashie> same
<ScootaChicken> First Gen is best Gen
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> Yes it is
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I don't know, but it's not that hard to do and they'll thank BronyState as a sponsor
<WingedCurse> what song is this from?
<Hazard_3_> hahaha
<SkilledSkillet> It was a great generation
<ScootaChicken> is the stream not working for anyone else?
<ScootaChicken> mine just crashed
<Critchley> what from is this song
<IshBestPony> Second Gen is best Gen
<ScootaChicken> brb refreshing

<IshBestPony> mine also works
<Shizuka> 13can have page with name and stream done in like.. two minutes
<Mr> Sparkwarning : well, basacally acording to the creepypasta, the first wave of pokemon games released made some kids insane, and thats why they changing
<Dashie> 1st generation is the best and always will be, after the 1st it started to go a little overboard, 2nd was cool though
<Hazard_3_> which made it worse
<derpsalot> lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02<HerderBezem> just brainstorming here, imagine we get a videostream running of about 100 silly dutchmen getting pumped for the next ep, how big is the chance we would get a couple of seconds airtime on bronystate? ():)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02<SuperBrony64> Faster than you can say SILLY FILLY :3
<Jim> I like the first gen of pokemon, the second one is also ok, but I haven't cared for any later generations
<Kira_Pony_Yamato> I agree, I didn't play past the 2nd gen
<Dashie> epic comment
<Sparkwarning> Thanks for that Mr
<ScootaChicken> it seems like I'm the only person who really likes Gen 3
<LadyCanary> ...This sounds very familiar.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> Do it Saxy!
<KernelCobb> then take a little something sweet
<OneTrickPony> why is Pinkie so white?
<prince-dari> So at least as many or more than we get for BMN.

<SkilledSkillet> Applejack looks way too excited
<DashWithRainbows> so much /me...
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, that's a main reason why I drafted the mod infractions
<prince-dari> So if possible try to be in for an hour, even half an hour before the pony episode starts.
<ValtheJean> >bring up time to dari
<pony_8295> All you gotta do is take a cup of coc-caine add it to the mix! next mix something a little sweet not sour, a little weed just a pinch..
