<Austin> |Omega| won
<Animals> but pretty much everything that suppors the classic controller supports the gc controller, atleast everything ive tried
<xdpirate> Animals, yeah, I think the classic one looks hard on the palms =/

<Stormy> :D
<xdpirate> Animals, $9 controller - http://www.focalprice.com/detail_GW045B.html

<Lambda> That video is exactly what Americans are like
<lukegb> Also because it's H<tab>
<Austin> like almost everybody uses BaNNeRBoT, Arikado sometimes uses Mega-Bot, Genolo almost always uses Mega-Bot, and you use HaxxBot :P
<Lambda> or at least all the Americans I know
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> kidding of course
<InfamousZed> shut up lambda

<CobraX83> for a base
<Austin> its the only one whose quit since
<Austin> `-`
<Stormy> you're in Mexico?!?!?!
<Lambda> XD at the sunglasses part
<Stormy> Get back here
<Lambda> nah, I just felt like being rebellious
<Stormy> ...in America!
<sexual> no
<Lambda> Smuggle me back!
<Lambda> To America!
<sexual> you need to try ios249 with base 38
<Lambda> Where we all wear sunglasses, even in the dark!
<Stormy> lol
<Austin> lukegb: you lost #banwars btw
<InfamousZed> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRmCtfiz9FE
<InfamousZed> same series
<CobraX83> oh hey i notice it says to install the current selection you need the files in fat0"/ios/000000001000etc
<sexual> CobraX83 you can also try and use ios 36 instead of 249 to install the base you neeed
<sexual> (37)
<lukegb> Inorite
<CobraX83> could it be that i dont have anything in that root
<InfamousZed> "i had lived in an orphanage because i fired our parents"
<Ex35-lap> is it indianna jones lego , or indiana jones orifginal adventures to get 4.3 softmod ?
<lukegb> who's still in it?
<InfamousZed> i haveto lol at that one
<Lambda> XD
<Austin> |Omega|
<Lambda> Stormy
<Austin> he won
<Stormy> what
<Austin> again
<Lambda> You should fire your parents
<Austin> :<
<Stormy> :D
<Stormy> I SHOULD
<CobraX83> so should i try with a 36 will that work with what im trying to do?
<Lambda> :D
<InfamousZed> but you have to be obcenely rich
<Stormy> All the more reason I should be a manager of Walmart
<Lambda> She is
<InfamousZed> screw the rule i have money
<Lambda> everybody who lives in her town is
<Lambda> :P
<sexual> CobraX83
<sexual> try and you will see
<CobraX83> ya
<CobraX83> k
<Stormy> Although that wouldn't exactly make me rich I don't think
<Stormy> Oh yeah, I forgot everyone where I live is a millionaire
<Lambda> Hmm
<Lambda> Mhm
<Lambda> explained by your private school and all that jazz
<Lambda> and lack of a public school
<Stormy> Yeah right
<InfamousZed> maybe can screw the rules cause she has money
<Lambda> hehehe
<InfamousZed> *maybe stormy
<Stormy> I went to public school most of my life
<CobraX83> nice job sexual it looks like that may have worked
<Lambda> just so you know InfamousZed, this is not true
<InfamousZed> ive been in a private school most of my life
<Lambda> but some people we went to school with beleived that everybody from her town is rich
<Lambda> they were from my area
<Stormy> There is a section of my city specifically for obscenely rich people though
<CobraX83> ahh crap got 6 of 15 dld and am getting a error making http request?
<Lambda> which makes everyone who lives near me stupiud
<Lambda> *stupid
<sexual> sounds like an internetproblem
<Stormy> You have to be invited to even get in there
<Lambda> there is here too
<InfamousZed> go live with them stormy and screw the rules
<Lambda> well, not that much
<Lambda> no invites here
<Stormy> There's an admission gate and hedges around it so you can't see it
<Lambda> just that you have to be rich to be able to afford to live in the rich part of town here
<CobraX83> yup its going fine now
*Lambda has seen this part of town, from the outside of course
<Lambda> Stormy showed me it
<Lambda> then they shot me for looking at it too long
<Stormy> Why would you even want to live in a closed off area like that?
<Stormy> Seems stupid to me
<Lambda> I agree
<Stormy> but of course they'll just say I'm "just jealous" or something :P
<InfamousZed> so you know your neighbors arnt gona steal from you i guess
*Aristeo pops in
<Lambda> keep the Hamburglars away from their rich-person-McDonalds or something
<CobraX83> nice thank u very much man it worked all miont
<CobraX83> you are the man such a big help thank u
<Lambda> Sup Aristeo
*Aristeo would rather live in a mansion :3
<Lambda> Speaking of hamburglars
*Lambda hides his quarter pounder from Aristeo
<InfamousZed> i had one of those third pounders the other day
<InfamousZed> with...
*InfamousZed looks around for aicebo
<InfamousZed> bacon...
<Aristeo> :o
<InfamousZed> i'ma hungary now
<jj26linux> wow so I just started with linux today and it def takes time to get use to
<Lambda> you're a third world country in Eastern Europe?
<InfamousZed> nyet
<xdpirate> jj26linux, you have no prior experience with a unix-like system?
<EpicStatsGuy> HERE COMES THE LAG TRAIN
<jj26linux> nope none
<jj26linux> figured id get my feet wet tpday
<xdpirate> ouch
<xdpirate> read this then
<xdpirate> http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
<InfamousZed> we are a proud people with rich heritage and ground beef that rivals that of mcdonalds
<xdpirate> the console is an integral part of the system, so you should learn how to use it straight away
<jj26linux> I have kubuntu does that matter?
<InfamousZed> in america
<xdpirate> nope, the basics are the same
<Stormy> XD
<jj26linux> any program to get my dual screen back?
<xdpirate> google is your friend
<xdpirate> http://www.lockergnome.com/linux/2007/06/18/dual-monitors-with-ubuntu/
<Lambda> Hehehe
<xdpirate> (ubuntu and kubuntu are the same operating system, they just use different window managers)
<lbiza> heres the deal my fellow comrades.... i think i modded my friends wii correctly, but one thing is for sure... dvd-r from memorex dont work lol
<jasperdett> !do gives jasperdett a high five
*jasperbot gives jasperdett a high five
<xdpirate> if he's got a new wii then no dvdrs will work
<lbiza> its old
<Aristeo> xD
<lbiza> LU379 or some shiz
<xdpirate> aha, try writing them at a lower speed, and if that doesn't work, try another brand :p
<jasperdett> !do test
*jasperbot test
<^Wulfgar^> verbatim > *
<xdpirate> do it oldschool at 2x
<jasperdett> :D
<^Wulfgar^> and of course, usb > *
<lbiza> i did 4x
<lbiza> still its like
<lbiza> is this shit supposed to auto load if it does work?
<xdpirate> i agree with ^Wulfgar^ on the usb part
<lbiza> or do i gotta goto hmc
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, what's the problem?
<lbiza> and like load from gx
<lbiza> well im just tryin to rule out that dvd-r does NOT work
<xdpirate> even though my wii can't play DVD-Rs, I'm loving usb loading. i have a modded psx and i have a million cds floating around
<lbiza> we havent gotta external to test with
<lbiza> atleast not FAT32 and i have like a gizzilion hd shiz on most of em
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, if your wii is softmodded, burn at 2x and load with neogamma
<lbiza> so i dont wanna fuck with that route
<Lambda> !insult ChanServ
<lbiza> word
<Proto> !do insult
<^Wulfgar^> wii can read ntfs as well
<lbiza> oh it can?
<lbiza> with what? i thought it took only FAT or FAT32
<^Wulfgar^> yes...but ntfs is read only... meaning you can't use a usb loader to copy commercial games to the usb hdd
<xdpirate> yup, but no scrubbing unless you store them as wbfs files, and you can't write to the disk
<xdpirate> microsoft should open-source ntfs specification so writing fully-featured drivers would be easier :P
<lbiza> yes
<lbiza> fat is rihtarded
<^Wulfgar^> fat32 > * when it comes to wii
<xdpirate> fat32 is good
<lbiza> whats wrong with good ol NTFS?
<xdpirate> i use wbfs though, because i don't use much homebrew, and the homebrew i use is lauched from the sd card permanently installed into the wii
<lbiza> heres the deal will i still need the sd card in there?
*Stormy is talking to an old friend on MSN
<lbiza> that SD card is mine lol
<xdpirate> no
<xdpirate> not unless you set up forwarder channels
<lbiza> 10-4
<^Wulfgar^> with fat32 you don't need an sd
<lbiza> with CFG?
<Lambda> who's that?
<CobraX83> guys how can u get a wii game to appear in uloader?
<CobraX83> im following a guide and it says now all you have to do is plug the hard drive into the wii and boot uloader.
<CobraX83> find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
<CobraX83> turn on usb saves and "use DLC from x:/nand/
<CobraX83> then click ok. twice.
<CobraX83> now load game.
<Aristeo> ooooo, Lambda is jealous :3
<Lambda> no, I'm just curious :(
<Stormy> Miguel from the second spyroforum rebellion
<Lambda> ah
*InfamousZed is now away - Reason : Haietus
*InfamousZed is now away - Reason : Haietus
<xdpirate> lbiza, i dunno if cfg can be installed into nand, i use usb loader gc
<xdpirate> gx
<xdpirate> *
<lbiza> xd, do u recommend to have forwarder channels?
<Aristeo> :o
*InfamousZed is no longer away : Gone for 25 seconds
*InfamousZed is no longer away : Gone for 25 seconds
*Aristeo grabs popcorn and listens to drama
<xdpirate> nope because then you cant use the channels unless you have an sd card in there at all times
<Lambda> lol
*InfamousZed is now away - Reason : momento mori
*InfamousZed is now away - Reason : momento mori
<Lambda> 25 second hiatus?
<lbiza> 10-4
<lbiza> well i "merged" some shit together
<lbiza> thats all i remember
<lbiza> i think that was just part of it
<xdpirate> i don't use cfg for anything else but ripping games, so i don't know if you can install it into nand, but you can install usb loader gx into nand with the WAD provided at their google code page
<^Wulfgar^> xdpirate, bullshit...I don't even use an sd in my wii
<lbiza> but i had to use "36" not "236"
<xdpirate> ^Wulfgar^, D:
<lbiza> cuz i didnt have "236"
<Lambda> I'm assuming Miguel was on your side during the rebellion?
<Lambda> :P
<xdpirate> I thought the cfg forwarder... *forwarded* to the SD card
<Stormy> Yeah
<xdpirate> then again, I'm not a CFG user, so pardon my ignorance :P
<lbiza> and pardon mine as well
<Stormy> I just told him I left SF because SR got mad at me for something completely retarded
<lbiza> im still learning about it
<Lambda> lol
<Stormy> His response: "rofl"
<Lambda> truth
<lbiza> i modded my 360 yrs ago but it just got the RROD
<Lambda> but still funny
<lbiza> so im focusing my attention on me and my friends wii
<Lambda> ha
<xdpirate> red ring, isn't that xb lol :p
<lbiza> yeah
<lbiza> its lame as hell
<^Wulfgar^> if you format your usb hdd to fat32, you can copy the contents of your sd to your usb hdd and boot off that
<lbiza> and supposedly u can use whats called "X-clamp" to fix it
<lbiza> but even then its kinda 50/50
<sexual> cfg forwarders arent any different from gx forwarders
<lbiza> its like $25
<xdpirate> i read something about that over 20% of people recieving their xbox 360 had the red ring within a week
<sexual> if they are setup correctly they search for sd and usb
<lbiza> for all the shit including the "artic thermal paste"
<Lambda> Stormy and Aicebo are my only friends on MSN that still use it :(
<xdpirate> with only 6% having problems with the wii
<Stormy> gmail ftw
<Lambda> same goes for Gmail
<Aristeo> :D
<lbiza> well im modding my friends first
*Aristeo has MSN and Gmail
<lbiza> to see if i wanna mod mine
<lbiza> lol
<Lambda> actually, Aicebo and Stormy are my only contacts who are ever online on anything
<Lambda> :(
<lbiza> its done but i still need to test his with ext usb hdd
<lbiza> can i test it by just putting something on my ntfs drive?
<lbiza> just to make sure? or how do i know its modded?
<^Wulfgar^> install cfgloader, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager
<lbiza> 10-4
*Aristeo turns Lambda's frown upside down
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, you can find the release thread for CFGLoader here: http://tinyurl.com/wii-cfgloader
<Lambda> :)
<Lambda> :|
<CobraX83> hey sexual im literally on my last step how can i get rock band 2 to be seen in uloader all i see is like vc games and my scumm emulator and homebrew channel
<Lambda> :(
<Lambda> didn't stay
<Lambda> :)
<Lambda> jk
<Lambda> :D
<CobraX83> the guide says now all you have to do is plug the hard drive into the wii and boot uloader.
<CobraX83> find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
<CobraX83> turn on usb saves and "use DLC from x:/nand/
<CobraX83> then click ok. twice.
<CobraX83> now load game.
<sexual> i dont use uloader so no idea
<lbiza> so once i get it to .wbfs i open up wii backup manager
<sexual> what format is your hdd?
<lbiza> on the wii
<lbiza> and load the wbfs with it
<CobraX83> my hf sexual ?
<CobraX83> its fat 32
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, no
<lbiza> shit fire
<lbiza> im not a smart man jenny
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, you convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager... put .wbfs file in /wbfs/ folder on usb hdd, load with cfgloader
<lbiza> thank u

<Soyuz|LP> 02ohai drake
<sexual> CobraX83 no idea you need to google around
<Drake> 04hai
<CobraX83> hmm this is the only guide lol
<CobraX83> seriously its written like days ago i believe
<CobraX83> shit says to plug it in and look for it in uloader
<CobraX83> uloader is ugly as hell and i dont see it anywhere in there
<EpicStatsGuy> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon Punches!
<Aicebo> sorry slow replies I'm also editing
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> what are you working on?
<Aicebo> collab parts
*Lambda has to wake up at 6 tomorrow D:
<Aicebo> ew that's lame
<sexual> CobraX83 might be that you need to convert your rockband wbfs to a ciso file
<CobraX83> ohh really
*Aicebo has just successed in finishing a whole collab project within 2 hours. yaaaay.
<Lambda> nice
<CobraX83> why bc uloader reads ciso?
<sexual> yea
<Aicebo> UGH someone just lit a firework outside wtf
<CobraX83> k thanks man ill try it
<Lambda> I've been shocked, there haven't been many fireworks around here since I got home
<Lambda> none actually
<Lambda> not even the day after the fourth
<CobraX83> u recommend anything to get the iso to ciso
<CobraX83> quick free prog
<sexual> wii backup manager
<CobraX83> nice i didnt know it made ciso ill do that now thanks
<Aicebo> I should take a break my fingers are so friggin cramped from doing so many projects :'D bbl

<Stormy> are you just now figuring out that Mass Effect is full of cliches?
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> no, I knew it all along
<Lambda> I just laughed at the way they point it out
<lbiza> in all honesty ur tight, i dont even care how stupid u think i am (cuz i prolly am)
<Lambda> but it wasn't until you played that I knew how much of a Mary Sue Shepard is
<Lambda> my Shepard at least
<lbiza> but i dont care cuz its all in fun

<Lambda> the whole article you mean?
<damooo> hello
<Lambda> I'm skimming through the ME2 one
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14fail didn't work
<Lambda> keyword "skimming"
<damooo> is there a software hack out for 4.3 out yet?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14stupid command prompt >>
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I forgot to load the modules XD
<Neo-Phyte> to down grade if i seem to know
<Neo-Phyte> as been reading
<Lambda> Anthromorphists are humanized animals, right?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Testing again
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14fff
<Stormy> yeah
<Lambda> "No two species are identical. All must be judged on their own merits. Treating every species like one's own is racist. Even benign anthropomorphism." ~ Legion
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas goes to #spam
<Lambda> I lol'd
<damooo> yeah
<damooo> any downfall on downgrading i heard it can be bad?
*Stormy doesn't get it
<Lambda> I lol'd at his view of racism I mean
<Neo-Phyte> well i wont do yet till i see a better way as i read tut and i like a better way so ill wait
<Lambda> pretty much the opposite of the modern one
<Animals> downgrading is pretty much unnecessary
<|Shadow|> damooo
<damooo> yes
<damooo> ?
<Lambda> also, look at this "Fanservice: A surprising large number of your squad members fall into this, unlike in the first game where everyone full suits of armour. Ironically, the romance scenes were toned down."
<|Shadow|> typ the command ? downgrade
<Lambda> XD
<|Shadow|> and follow the guide
<Lambda> Sounds like it was quoted straight from you
<damooo> downgrade
<Stormy> It does
<Stormy> Boo fanservice
<damooo> ?downgrade
<|TripleH|> with the ?
<Lambda> I agree
<|TripleH|> with space
<damooo> ? downgrade
<|TripleH|> there you go champ =p
<damooo> cheers
<|lucid|> downgrade
<|lucid|> ?downgrade
<|lucid|> lol
<Animals> why would people downgrade? does 4.3 cause issues?
<Lambda> That means you Cynder, Miranda, and every single character of Twilight!
<|Shadow|> yes
<|Shadow|> problems
<|Shadow|> best to downgrade
<Animals> with what?
<damooo> animals cant softmod with 4.3
<|Shadow|> and it has quto-update
<Animals> i was reading something on a softmod for 4.3u....something about installing a korean ios
<|Shadow|> it wont ask u to update
<Stormy> "The very end, after you defeat Sovereign. Debris fills the room, fires are everywhere, and the rescue crews are working their way inside. They come across your squadmates, who are dazed, shocked, and look as if they've just had their world crushed. Quiet, sad pianos sound in the background, and Shepard is nowhere to be found. The camera pans up to show the shattered windows and the massive piece of Sovereign lying around, and it suddenly s
<Stormy> looool
<|Shadow|> it will do it now on its own
<Lambda> quote incomplete
<|Shadow|> Animals, the koreon ios is apart of the downgrade prosses
<Lambda> but sounds very accurate right there
<Stormy> It showed the whole thing for me
<Stormy> Where did it cut off?
<Lambda> The camera pans up to show the shattered windows and the massive piece of Sovereign lying around, and it suddenly s
<Neo-Phyte> ? downgrade
<Stormy> seems as if Shepard really is dead. Then the music begins torise, you see boots running on the floor, and right as the music hits an intense, heroic crescendo, Shepardclimbs up into view. Commence the cries of BAAAAAAAAAADDDAAAAASS! If you're not feeling like a Big [censored] Hero at that moment, you're not human."
<Animals> yea, the thing i was reading was about using the korean ios to install cios and shit
<Animals> for 4.3
<Animals> but whatever, im on 4.2 anyway :)
<|lucid|> downgrade ?
<Lambda> O.o
<Lambda> I just pressed "XD" and got a debug screen
<Animals> http://gbatemp.net/t238889-4-3-virgin-softmod-guide <---- what i was reading, i believe
<Animals> never tried it, so cant confirm
<Stormy> ...wtf?
<|Shadow|> fuck 4.3
<Lambda> Ah
<Stormy> How do you "press XD"?
<Lambda> Ctrl + "D"
<|Shadow|> there is no reosn to be even on 4.2
<|Shadow|> for that matter
<Animals> i dont see the difference between 4.1 and 4.2, but i dunno
<Perseid> 4.0 here.
<Lambda> well, the "X" and "D" keys is what I meant
<Animals> wii came with 4.2, so i kept it at 4.2 :)
<Lambda> *I pressed the X and D keys
<Perseid> Yeah, there's no reason to downgrade from 4.2 if you're already there. But no reason to upgrade to 4.2.
<Animals> thats how i feel
<Lambda> but anyway
<Lambda> you know you got goosebumps at that part
<Animals> if i mod a wii that has 4.1, i just leave it at 4.1
<Lambda> I know I did
<Lambda> :P
<Animals> obviously, system menu version after 4.0 doesnt really matter, since ios can be updated individually
<Stormy> possibly
<Lambda> "Gas Leak Coverup: "Ah, yes, 'Reapers'...""
<Quazi> oops isn't theren ocussing SORRY
<Lambda> LOLOLOL
<Animals> shoot, some people stay on 3.x and dont care
<Quazi> wrong chan
<Quazi> lol
<Stormy> ???
<Animals> thats okay quazi, it didnt make any sense anyway :)
<Lambda> The Turian counciler says that all the time
<Lambda> and Gas Leak Coverup is a trope of the government denying what the good guy says

<SparkART> 2coffee with a bunsen burner
<SparkART> 2that's a first
<CUM_quesa> no other site is down for me
<Sina3> how hard is it to make an app for wii to rip a DVD into an sd card or usb?
<Sina3> without the usb card
<|Shadow|> there is already one
<Sina3> really?
<|Shadow|> http://filetrip.net/f9332-SuperDump-1-3.html
<CUM_quesa> anyway, I just updated my wii shop channel through wiiscu but wii shop still says it's not up to date and asks for a system update
<CUM_quesa> and I'm trying to figure out why
<Sina3> this works with dvd movies?
<Sina3> with like
<|Shadow|> no
<Sina3> video_ts and audio_ts?
<|Shadow|> use your pc
<|Shadow|> duh
<Neo-Phyte> he wanted to rip a dvd to a wii
<Neo-Phyte> not a dump
<|Shadow|> witch is ironiclky stupid
<Sina3> to my usb drive
<Neo-Phyte> yes
<|Shadow|> witch is ironiclky stupid
<Neo-Phyte> wii suxs on dvd vid
<Neo-Phyte> haha
<|Shadow|> what be the perpus of doing tht anyways
<Neo-Phyte> hell if i know
<Flamelugia> tee hee
<|Shadow|> there isnt any apps' wii side to play video files of a dvd mo\vie
<SparkART> 2eh?
<Neo-Phyte> seems not needed is why he left
<|Shadow|> only system i know that can play dvd iso's console wize is xbox with XBMC
<Neo-Phyte> well food time im to old to miss that and wife kills me and work tommorow have fun shadow will need help with a psp someday :)
<|Shadow|> ok
<Neo-Phyte> yepyep
<CUM_quesa> seriously, though, why would a single website be down for only me?
<CUM_quesa> could this be a high-level routing problem?
<fierygt> anybody happen to know the latest wiiscrubber version? just trying to get a dual layer super smash bros to work on the softmod...
<rosch> or your router
<rosch> or upstream to your provider
<llrcombs> or your hosts file
<llrcombs> or your DNS server
<Flamelugia> no problem
<CUM_quesa> the IP I get for wiibrew.org is 195.178.184.67
<|Shadow|> um
<|Shadow|> u dont do anything to the game
<rosch> that is correct
<|Shadow|> burn it to a DL dvd
<rosch> so you can ping it correctly?
<|Shadow|> and be sure to use the correct layerbreak
<Khold> funny, it resolves to 2001:9b0:102:babe:1010:0:0:14 for me
<fierygt> well...i did...and my nephew said it didn't work. but i didn't set the layer break. didn't know i needed to for the wii then.
<_tr0n> if there is one game i buy this year
<CUM_quesa> well I can ping it, I get no replies
<_tr0n> this is it
<_tr0n> http://www.411mania.com/game_article_pictures/13150.jpg
<fierygt> i'd still rather scrub it, if that works, rather than wasting another DL on it.
<Sonic41> Hi children
<CUM_quesa> but even if it were working properly in principle there could be an ICMP-traffic-blocking firewall between me and it
<rosch> try a proxy
*Altair sleeps now
<|Shadow|> 2084960
*Altafk sleeps now
<|Shadow|> fierygt, 2084960
<CUM_quesa> and that seems to work
<CUM_quesa> damn, though, this is irritating
<|Shadow|> use a DL scrubbing it will not get it on a dvd5
<|Shadow|> burn to a DL
<fierygt> damn. alright. i suppose i'll use a dl. thanks.
<|Shadow|> why burn?
<|Shadow|> realy?
<|Shadow|> USB FTFW!!!
<llrcombs> set your DNS server to 8.8.8.8
<llrcombs> and that IP is an empty server for me
<CUM_quesa> still resolves to the same ip
<fierygt> because he doesn't have a freaking external usb hdd. when i initially gave him the game...i had his wii, and i did try it on one of my usb hdds, and it worked, so i just went on and burned it, thinking it would be fine
<CUM_quesa> maybe the old address is cached locally though
<rosch> do you have a cable router
<rosch> it might be awhile
<rosch> before its dns cache flushes
<rosch> try flushing your cache
<Betowolf25> just got back from watching dispicable me
*Aristeo offers Ryft and Stormy some toaster strudles :3
<|Shadow|> be a good unkel and buy his a drive

<Ryft> to say with russian form of grammar and sentence structure
<fierygt> sheesh. i find him all the games for his wii and DS as it is!
<|Shadow|> well
<|Shadow|> hoe old is he?
<llrcombs> set the IP on your computer, not the router
<fierygt> about 9
<llrcombs> (for DNS)
<|Shadow|> ok
<|Shadow|> read pm
<kiss162> hi shadow
<Flamelugia> was it any good?
*Aristeo offers Stormy some? :o
<Ryft> mmm
<CUM_quesa> I did
<CUM_quesa> restarted ncsd after setting resolv.conf to 8.8.8.8
<CUM_quesa> still getting the same ip
<Khold> that IP is correct so yea
*Stormy is too tired to eat
<Stormy> And apparently I don't get nick alerts from /me

<rosch> anyone have experience setting up DKP with VS
<CUM_quesa> 195.178.184.67 is?
<Khold> yes

<lbiza> if i had a previous version of neo gamma
<|Shadow|> Ded_, WD MyPassPort Essentials
<lbiza> and i got the latest and wanted to just overwrite the SD
<lbiza> could i do so
<Animals> Ded_: what shadow said, or hitachi simpledrive

<|Shadow|> yes
<Ded_> friends been buggin me to find a cheap / self powered
<Ded_> ill let him know

<viince> I have hdd...but some games don't play from usb hdd
<Ded_> im using an old school IDE external drive, has its own power supply heh

<|Shadow|> brb gtg pee
<viince> tom clancy splinter cell double agent, csi,

<|lucid|> i have a 320GB, still havent filled it up yet
<|Shadow|> im 58% full on my 500GB
<Ded_> well
<lbiza> do we need backup manager before we use gamma?
<|Shadow|> no
<Ded_> im on this wii wiki page and it shows the seagate go as being compatible as long as you're running cios rev 14
<|Shadow|> wbm is for usb
<|Shadow|> Ded_, 14 is old
<|Shadow|> so u should have them be running latest
<|Shadow|> rev19
<lbiza> shadow so what can i do about this error?
<|Shadow|> try another game
<Ded_> "Seagate FreeAgent GO 320 GB "Works- use the bundled software to disable inactive drive spindown (now available on the seagate site); or use cIOS rev14 (spindown fixed)"
<|Shadow|> use rev19
<Ded_> im sure newer than 14 is fine
<Ded_> yea
<|Shadow|> Ded_
<Ded_> good thing a bout that drive is its right down the street at best buy for $59 heh
<Ded_> wouldnt even have to order it
<Monferno> Hello
<|Shadow|> WTF
<|Shadow|> u dont know your local bestbuy
<|Shadow|> what the fuck is wrong with u son?
<Ded_> huh?
<Ded_> i just said its right down the street heh
<|Shadow|> oh i read that wrong
<Ded_> go there all the time
<Ded_> ah ok
<|Shadow|> thought u saidu was going to right it down
<Ded_> lol
<|lucid|> why would you buy the seagate when you can get this
<|lucid|> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Western+Digital+-+WD+Elements+320GB+External+USB+2.0+Portable+Hard+Drive/9832481.p?id=1218180648504&skuId=9832481
<|lucid|> no drive spindown problems
<|Shadow|> Ded_, WD is the prefered brand to get
<Ded_> |lucid| guess im being lazy cause its not my drive doh
<Ded_> yea ill go for the WD
<Ded_> thanks for the head sup
<Ded_> heads
<|lucid|> thats the one i use, i bought it used at a pawn shop for like $40, works great
<|Shadow|> witch head?
<|Shadow|> LOL
<Ded_> ill have to get one of those myself , would make it easier to manage
<Ded_> instead of my current external which uses its own power supply
<Ded_> have to unplug it everytime i move it to my pc to add games heh
<essecks> wiihack
<essecks> hmm
<essecks> lots of folk in here
<essecks> anyone know anything about loadstructor or crap?
<|lucid|> there was a kid with an Erector set in the Sandlot
<essecks> that is a bold faced lie
<|Shadow|> essecks, no we dont
<essecks> i'm never gonna get it working =o\
<dlukz> essecks, don't bother with it
<dlukz> it'll clutter your channels
<dlukz> just use a usb loader
<essecks> i use cover flow
<|lucid|> wow
<|lucid|> thats old school
<essecks> i just wanted to add a couple specific titles i used frequently
<essecks> like netflix
<|lucid|> get cfgloader
<lbiza> i wonder if we needed it set to a diff channel other than 249
<dlukz> essecks, gimme a sec..i'll check it out
<essecks> and no matter what i do i can't get the bastards to work
<essecks> <3
<essecks> whats cfgloader?
<|Shadow|> lbiza, nope
<|Shadow|> essecks, http://www.sendspace.com/file/3rf94s
<lbiza> well than tiger 011 wont work with it
<|lucid|> cfgloader looks like coverflow and you can install netflix to the hard drive
<lbiza> what if i burn at 2x?
<lbiza> even tho its shitty media
<lbiza> memorex
<|Shadow|> memorx is good brand
<essecks> also known as cLoader?
<|Shadow|> wii reads them jsut fine
<|Shadow|> no
<|Shadow|> cloader wtf is that?
<essecks> dunno
<lbiza> wii reads memorex just fine?
<|Shadow|> yes
<|lucid|> i think it means Uloader
<lbiza> this shit should work! we fucked up somewhere down the line
<rosch> too bad eh
<|Shadow|> thats what i burnt on for my wii games back in the day
<essecks> okay, so cfgLoader is a usb loader that makes system menu channels?
<lbiza> we have a old wii to boot
<dlukz> essecks, no
<lbiza> is there a way to look up the dvd error codes given by neo gamma?
<|lucid|> my 3.1 wii plays backups from dvds
<|Shadow|> essecks, its the best usbloader out there
<dlukz> http://clusterrr.com/dump/loadstructor.png that looks pretty self explanitory
<essecks> does it have a homepage?
<lbiza> lucid what about a LU379?
<essecks> i'll just ltfg
<|Shadow|> lbiza, your wii is fine
<|Shadow|> burn another fucking game
<|Shadow|> like smg1
<|Shadow|> shit
*kiss161|a lähettää 161 musta leidi muuvieta to |Shadow|
<essecks> OH YEAH, i tried migrating to this way back in the day
<essecks> holy crap i have dejavu
<|lucid|> use IMGburn to burn your game
<lbiza> i used nero
<lbiza> should i use imgburn latest?
<|lucid|> yes
<|Shadow|> there is were u fucked up
<essecks> why cfgloader > cover flow?
<|Shadow|> nero is shit for wii
<lbiza> 4x or 2x?
<|Shadow|> essecks, because its best
<|lucid|> imgburn is good for burning everything, movies, wii games, xbox 360 games
<|Shadow|> http://www.imgburn.com/
<lbiza> ok i knew that for x360
<|lucid|> i burn at 4x for the wii, i dont know if that matters but plays perfectly
<lbiza> and i will punish myself later
<lbiza> i have an older version of img burn
<lbiza> but ill get latest
<|Shadow|> http://www.imgburn.com/
<essecks> maybe
<lbiza> k
<essecks> imgburn is awesome
<|lucid|> if you look at the disc that imgburn did and the nero disc you can see the difference
<|Shadow|> nero = bloatware
<lbiza> 2x or 4x
<|Shadow|> 16x
<lbiza> im gonna try the same game
<|lucid|> cfg loader : http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
<June9th> anyone tried/used tri-force
<lbiza> 16x i thought slower
<|Shadow|> nah
<|Shadow|> i burnt all mine at 16x
<|Shadow|> never had a problem
<|lucid|> if you have a pioneer burner i dont think it matters
<|Shadow|> pioneer FTW!!!
<|Shadow|> 3CDRom Drive: PIONEER DVD-RW DVR-116D

<|Omega|> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALRIGHT
<|Omega|> I win.
<|Omega|> Welcome back IOS61 ;)
<bor> sup all
<bor> i just received my wii. it already came presoftmodded. im new to softmodding and have a lot of reading up to do. but right now i just want to play some games. so im about to go to the store to buy an external HDD (WD Passport). and im wondering if i need to pick up an SD card aswell. do i need one for installing homebrew and modifying stuff or will a USB HDD be enough?
<bor> also, i have already experienced that back-up dvd's run at slower speeds and can cause stuttering. if i rip these backup games to HDD, will that stop the stuttering?
<lukegb> Austin: ha!
<DasTier> yes
<lukegb> !rules
<IOS61> lukegb: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<bor> to both?
<DasTier> bor: an sd card makes it easier but is not needed per se, but I'd highly recommend getting one since none of the guides tell you how to boot without one
<DasTier> also, for certain steps the sd card is required, so if you ran into one of those, you'd need one no matter
<bor> alright, i doubt i will do much modifying to my system tho, as its a korean box and i read they are easiest to brick
<DasTier> ie. you can setup homebrew channel and others to use a harddisk but you can only install homebrew channel from SD
<bor> ah i see
<DasTier> they are just as easy to brick as any other wii, if you use an US update on a korean wii, that's a brick. If you use EU update on a US wii, that's a brick
<DasTier> the thing is just that so many people try to install US firmware on korean wiis
<bor> mkay
<bor> i have US firmware on it i think
<bor> or english firmware
<DasTier> there is an English hack, but it's still korean firmware inside
<bor> doubt the korean version will come with an english language pack
<bor> ah
<bor> and ehm, what file system for the HDD do you recommend?
<DasTier> fat32 so that homebrew channel can work with it
<DasTier> ntfs is read-only and wbfs is isos-only
<bor> but that has filesize limitations
<DasTier> so if you want to NOT use an sd card you will need fat32
<bor> and i already saw that super smash bros for example is 7GB
<DasTier> isos on the disk are stored in .wbfs files which are split in chunks of 1-2GB
<bor> USB Loader GX is installed on it already
<DasTier> but of course you're right, some people recommend ntfs to get around the 2GB limitation, but no wii app can write to ntfs
<bor> if i install games with that, will that auto split the games in parts?
<DasTier> depends on the version, most people here recommend using cfgloader instead of GX
<bor> k
<bor> any risks of bricking the box if i connect it to the internet?
<bor> obv i wont install a new firmware when prompted
<bor> but other than that, any risks?
<DasTier> firmware 4.3 doesn't allow you to disable auto updating anymore, but if that wii has 4.3 you'll run into many other problems anyway, I doubt anyone with a sane mind would install 4.3 on a softmodded wii
<bor> i think i have 4.1
<bor> it said 4.1u in the wii settings menu anyway
<DasTier> that's what you'd end up with when following most of the existing guides, yes
<DasTier> oh?
<DasTier> 4.1u is the US firmware, I wonder what the previous owner did to install that without bricking
<bor> it came from a shop in bangkok, he didnt speak much english ;)
<bor> how do i install the games on the HDD anyway. is it just a matter of dragging the ISO's from my computer to the HDD, plug it into my wii and run USB Loader GX to install? or do i need a WBFS manager?
<DasTier> wbfs manager is for wbfilesystem formatted drives, wii backup manager is for fat/ntfs
<bor> cool thanks
<bor> will read up on that
<DasTier> both gx and cfgloader can dump actual disks to the drive too if it's writable (not ntfs)
<DasTier> ? list
<bor> ? list
<DasTier> no factoid for wii backup manager
<bor> ? hddcompatibility
<DasTier> ^Wulfgar^ usually posts a link to it as long as he's not asleep ;)
<bor> he wrote it?
<DasTier> no he's just usually very active in here, just now it's the middle of the night for him I think
<bor> right right
<bor> thanks for your help DasTier, im off to the store now ^_^
<EpicStatsGuy> HERE COMES THE LAG TRAIN
<Ziggy^^> !rules
<IOS61> Ziggy^^: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<Ziggy^^> Good morning everyone...
<lukegb> Ziggy^^: hi
<Ziggy^^> I have noticed recently that my wii appears to have a certain lag when using homebrew
<lukegb> Hmm? Haven't heard of that before.
<Ziggy^^> its strange
<Ziggy^^> i have other issues but may go against rules so i wont ask those
<Ziggy^^> is there something i can use that helps diagnose ios issues/>
<lukegb> syscheck?
<lukegb> !wb sysCheck
<IOS61> sysCheck: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SysCheck
<IOS61> sysCheck does several checks on installed IOS and cIOS:
<lukegb> Well, all that does is tell you about your IOS'
<lukegb> Then again, if you've installed cioscorp/similar... It's likely you'd have problems.
<Ziggy^^> i guess i was thinking syscheck scanned drive for sectors but i guess that is bootmii
<Ziggy^^> i never installed cioscorp
<Ziggy^^> ive read a lot of bad things
<Ziggy^^> it was running fine until i put this program on there that i found online that is suppose to help keep ios's up to date
<Ziggy^^> it really screwed things up
<Ziggy^^> since then it hasnt been very stable
<Ziggy^^> does anyone recommend running one version over another (would that help in stability)?
<Ziggy^^> i was running 4.2 but then went to 4.1 to see if it would help

<Andrew> hey RN, hows things?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm ok thanks - got a fornight's temporary work in a law firm.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04how are you all?
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I'm watching this documentary about healthcare
<drf|laptop> 03does the free NHS in the UK work?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Maybe it will lead to permanent work but if not then I've earned a bit of money.
<drf|laptop> 03as ther eare also rumors that you have to wait forever to get treated
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Ask someone like Xai because he's the expert in politics LOL
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Andrew> lol
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04well it's good if you have little or no money I guess
<drf|laptop> 03Xai would just call me a stupid American -_-
<drf|laptop> 03because I'm slightly Republican
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04but people who are rich pay for private healthcare sometimes
<drf|laptop> 03and apparently that doesn't fly with him
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Andrew> yeah private healthcare ftw
<drf|laptop> 03you've never hadto go to the hospitcal?
<drf|laptop> 03-c
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Yeah
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm not rich so I used the NHS LOL
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03did it work?
<drf|laptop> 03or di dyou have to wait forever
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04But the hospital was so dirty I discharged myself
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04well I had to wait 8 hours to be seen
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03yeah that's what I've heard
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I was cured, that's the main thing
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04but...even if you've broken your limbs you still have to wait 8 hours even for painkillers
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04well approx 8 hours
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I suppose you'd have to go and buy your own.
<Andrew> only time i've been in an nhs hospital is when i broke my wrist, i was in and out in a couple of hours
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I had gastroenderitis and I just needed a drip and some antibiotics. They expected me to stay overnight but the dirtiness of the hospital made me feel even more ill so I went home.
<drf|laptop> 03well the American system is weirld
<drf|laptop> 03I broke my wrist and had to wait about 5 hours to be seen
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I've been bitten by dogs three times and those were the only other times
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Hi J Lugia
<drf|laptop> 03but that's becau\se they prioeritize people who actually need urgant care
<drf|laptop> 03like if you crack your head open or something
<drf|laptop> 03they'll ese you right away
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Well I couldn't eat or drink and they still made me wait
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04hehe
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, it's probably crap
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04If you pretend to have a fit in the waiting room that's your best bet to get seen first
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04not that I condone that sort of thing
<J-Lugia> hi Rocket_Ninetales!
<Andrew> haha
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04DRF let's just say the NHS is a necessary evil, otherwise there would be like a thousand people left
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Well - most people can't afford to pay to see a doctor like you have to in the US.
<drf|laptop> 03there are plenty of people here who can't afford it
<drf|laptop> 03they just die :/
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I know some people who wouldn't be able to afford the insurance payments for health.
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03most jobs here have free health insurance
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Ah, I didn't know that.
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, not like minimum wage jobs or something
<drf|laptop> 03but most salaried jobs will have it
<drf|laptop> 03my family's insurancde is free
<drf|laptop> 03through my dad's job
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Yeah I see what you mean. However - it's a sad situation when people have to be well off to avoid dying :/
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03well I agree that it doesn't work perfectlly
<drf|laptop> 03-l
<drf|laptop> 03the thing is MIchael Moore is kinda biased himself too
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04What do the elderly do in your country if they don't have a job and are on a small pension?
<drf|laptop> 03he's like a hardcore Democrat
<drf|laptop> 03Medicre.
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<drf|laptop> 03*Medicare
<drf|laptop> 03*that's* free
<drf|laptop> 03if you're over 60
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Oh that's good then.
<drf|laptop> 03however they don't pay for EVERYTHING
*Grimm fumigates for aristeos
<drf|laptop> 03like you still have to pay for medicine
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Here you get free prescriptions if you're on benefits, over 60 I think or over 65 or under 18
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04something like that
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04or if you lie on the form - again just an idea, and I don't condone it xD
<drf|laptop> 03well I dunno much about Medicare
<drf|laptop> 03but people like my grandparents have it
<drf|laptop> 03Medicaid is for poor people but it sucks
<drf|laptop> 03and they don't pay the doctors enough either
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04The NHS is ok to fulfull its purpose.
<drf|laptop> 03my mom doesn't take it becaus eof that
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04But some directors get like £100,000 a year
<drf|laptop> 03but she's private practice so she's kinda meh
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04of the NHS I mean
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, the guy in this movie makes £100,000 a year
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04so it's like....so you can't pay for breast cancer drugs but you can afford to pay them that money
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Glad to see they have their priorities right xD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04We even have a free vet service here for people on welfare.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04In other news, I know this is random...but I got woke up early this morning by a marching brass band :(
<drf|laptop> 03marching bands FTW
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Yeah but not when you've just been up until 3am xD

<Trace> weird
<Aristeo> :(
*Aristeo hugs soccer D:
<Aristeo> Hehe, Link on the Zelda games always gets the ladies :3
<Trace> i stick to football, its more interesting then watching these ppl just run after the ball without tackling eachother.. means there is no chance of the guys pantsing eachother :(
<Aristeo> Trace: You might like rugby or la cross or whatever that soccer/football hybrid is called
<Aristeo> soccer/football/hockey hybrid
<Aristeo> And you can tackle people in soccer. You can do a lot of rough stuff in soccer.
<Aristeo> Especially at the World Cup level
<Trace> i have yet to see any of it :(
<Aristeo> Unfortunately, at that level, there's more passing and less contact
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://miburl.com/1Ti30e <-- ... how did I end up here again? O____o

<Articuno> 12Meaning, their rather than his.. Ovo
<Zu-Zu> LOOOOOOOL
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Which is singular.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Everybody is here. You use is.
<Katie> 5what?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Rather than are.
<Articuno> 12Yes but you don't say "Everyone thinks he or she is stupid"
<Articuno> 12You say "They"
<Zu-Zu> correct
<Articuno> 12"Everyone thinks they are stupid"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Wrong:
<Articuno> 12It's not
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Common error.
<Articuno> 12Ok if you say so
<Zu-Zu> correct
<Altair> Well this isn't English class so k
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_They
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol.
<Zu-Zu> sigh dont show us shadows
<Altair> ahhhh crap.
<Altair> i need to port !lag to perl
<Articuno> 12Though "singular they" is widespread in everyday English and has a long history of usage, debate continues about its acceptability.
<Articuno> 12I'm sticking to what I say because it is English that we use today.
<Articuno> 12Not 100 years ago.
<Zu-Zu> ...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6ovo
<Zu-Zu> ok then...
<Articuno> 12It's like I'm hardly going to say "Do not, cannot, will not" in every sentence
<Articuno> 12I'd rather say don't, can't and won't.
<Articuno> 12There's nothing wrong with it
<Zu-Zu> um ok....
<Articuno> 12Or should I say, there is nothing wrong with it XD

<TimeShift> lol - that pic is sweet
<proppi> if you know what you are doing
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<Zu-Zu> lol
<drf|laptop> 03Asus is ... better than Dell and such
<proppi> and dont have to wait years on slow downloads :)
<Damos||ZzZ> 13every thing with drf is custom build
<^Wulfgar^> although WHY anyone would want dvds over usb is beyond me...
<drf|laptop> 03duh?
<ke-> And that's long I'd say
<Lostcase> not bad.. my first go around took me an hour... i should be faster this time..
<Glacymr> 12pretty soon
<drf|laptop> 03I built a desktop, and sorta built a laptop
<Glacymr> 12high definition
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, I just told them what to do
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Glacymr> 12is going to turn into drf definition
<Lostcase> Wulfgar, its an older person that im modding it for
<Damos||ZzZ> 13LOL
<^Wulfgar^> and? I'm 44
<Skylands> 10ohai Chimera /late

<Glacymr> 12i begged a differ
<yuyuyup> I love the nintendo wii and ds

<Damos||ZzZ> 13OO
*Stormy` 's curiosity got the better of her
<drf|laptop> 03nah
<drf|laptop> 03Asus is 3kinda a ripoff
<Lostcase> this person is in their mid 60's, never had a pc
<drf|laptop> 03I must say, my favorite "big name" brand is Acer
<drf|laptop> 03their stuff is pretty good
<Stormy`> It's actually nothing bad ._.
<drf|laptop> 03though I pretty much hate brandname computers now
<drf|laptop> 03and prefer making my own
<^Wulfgar^> so where are they gonna get their 'backups' from?
<Glacymr> 12which one do you hate the most?
<Zu-Zu> im using acer now
<Glacymr> 12yes
<Glacymr> 12i am asking this question
<Glacymr> 12knowing what the answer will be
<Damos||ZzZ> 13EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW ACER
<Chimera> Rooms sucks :D
*Chimera runs

<drf|laptop> 03Dell is alright for businesses
*Damos||ZzZ 13uses tackle on Apple
<Glacymr> 12that thing was durable as heck
<drf|laptop> 03but for home users they're a HUGE ripoff
<drf|laptop> 03Toshiba used to be good
<Glacymr> 12it was missing screws and was still operating
<Espeon> oo
<drf|laptop> 03but you still can't beat a custom build
<Glacymr> 12weird al has a really good computer
<Glacymr> 12he has a 150 GB of RAM
<Glacymr> 12his processor is so good that everyone elses chips are like doritos
<Lostcase> when did d3-2 show up on shelves?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03soon enough, Windows will require 150GB of RAM just to run

<drf|laptop> 03er I already spammed it
<Neon> Greetings.
<FlameLugia> thats not a good idea. it would be sad if tst lost you... while you were on it
*FlameLugia runs
<TimeShift> I could use tethering, too, yet I don't like to because it
<drf|laptop> 03well I cheat
<drf|laptop> 03They usually charge $60 to tether
<drf|laptop> 03I just don't pay it
<TimeShift> is quite imperformant and sucks the battery of my phone empty waay too fast
<drf|laptop> 03I use an app called EasyTether
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03if you plug the phone with USB
<drf|laptop> 03It charges it...
<drf|laptop> 03at least mine
<drf|laptop> 03as for speeds, it's like 1mbps which isn't bad for a phone
<TimeShift> why should I carry around cables if I'm mobile?
<drf|laptop> 03you only need one cable...
<drf|laptop> 03I put my laptop in a carrying case
<drf|laptop> 03I just shove it in there
<TimeShift> this puts the point "being mobile" quite ad absurdum
<drf|laptop> 03then once I'm in the car I get it out
<drf|laptop> 03eh
<drf|laptop> 03w/e
<drf|laptop> 03so you also don't bring a charger?
<drf|laptop> 03sounds like a brilliant idea
<TimeShift> mobile_no_wires
<drf|laptop> 03so when your battery dies, then what?
<drf|laptop> 03I just have a carrying case
<TimeShift> why bring a charging wire if the battery of the netbook lasts 10 hours and I'm just abour 4-5 hours away of a power plug?
<drf|laptop> 03that's perfectly moble
<drf|laptop> 03my battery lasts like 2 at most >_>

*Shiny-Growlithe doesn't understand Xeli's post

<drf|laptop> 03meh atom processors
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<drf|laptop> 03I like my 2.26GHz quad core
<Lostcase> "Put the SD card into the Wii, if you installed Bootmii as boot2 then it will load, if it is installed as an IOS go to the Homebrew Channel, press 'home' on your wiimote and select 'Launch Bootmii'."
<drf|laptop> 03as I can use this as a portable desktop
<drf|laptop> 03so it serves two purpose
<drf|laptop> 03s
<drf|laptop> 03portable, AND powerful
<Lostcase> yeh this happened to me last time i did it, didn't have bootmii as an option
<drf|laptop> 03unlike netbooks
<FlameLugia> do laptops work faster etc. when they are plugged in?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03well depends
<TimeShift> a quad core for mobile browsing is as pointless as a single american driving a huge truck. But well, suits you
<drf|laptop> 03sometimes, if the company makes it not run as fast on battery
<FlameLugia> to conserve battery power right?
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, you're assuming all I ever want to do in life is browse
<drf|laptop> 03for example I was watching a Blu-Ray disc on the way up here
<drf|laptop> 03in the car
<drf|laptop> 03your laptop probably couldn't even play Blu-rays
<drf|laptop> 03it's not powerful enough
<drf|laptop> 03and FlameLugia, yes
<TimeShift> of course I can watch movies. Not BluRays and this highly copyright-protected crap, but HD-movies work fine on my small book here
<drf|laptop> 03well I have an actual Blu-Ray drive
<drf|laptop> 03so I can play them ^^
<drf|laptop> 03I just mean, you can't do much more than browse with a 1.6GHz single core processor
<drf|laptop> 03I can actually game on this
<Espeon> Hey, it's me afterall.
*Espeon also tickles Xanbreon
<eXAKR> drf
<drf|laptop> 03what
<eXAKR> Can you pass me the code to your !iPod and !apple scripts?
<drf|away> 06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
<drf|laptop> 6EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
<TimeShift> it's a dual-core. And well, that's what a netbook is all about: Write stuff and browse around
<drf|laptop> 03eXAKR whya/
<drf|laptop> 03*?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I guess...I replied O.0
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, but that's my point
<TimeShift> I have my fullsize-notebook running 3.5 hours on battery and my standalone-computer for anything else
<drf|laptop> 03This way I only need *one* laptop
<drf|laptop> 03It's portable enough that I can take it anywhere
<eXAKR> I'm thinking of making my own scripts based on those
<drf|laptop> 03but I can also set it down on a desk, plug in a mouse, and game
<eXAKR> Like, !microsoft
<TimeShift> and I like specialized tools for the mission I need to go
*eXAKR RUNS
<drf|laptop> 03LOL no thanks then
<drf|laptop> 03I prefer just one computer that does it all
<eXAKR> lol k
*Glacymr noms eXAKR
<Espeon> .-.
*Arcanine tickles Espeon
<Espeon> re:re
*Espeon also squirms
<Arcanine> 04lol
<TimeShift> so you'll travel around for the most time with a hopeless overpowered monster, carry way too much weight for just reading mails and have a power-consuming mega-eater just for reading mails or watch a movie? Respect
<drf|laptop> 03first of all
<drf|laptop> 03what do you mean way too much weight
<Espeon> "I'm not sure what you just said, but I'm pretty sure you are an alien"
<drf|laptop> 03this is like 5 pounds
<drf|laptop> 03that's fine
<Espeon> I lol'd
<drf|laptop> 03and sure, I just leave htis plugges in
<drf|laptop> 03*plugged
<drf|laptop> 03I have a car plug
<drf|laptop> 03so I fail to see a problem
<TimeShift> well, my netbook is around ONE pound :)
<Damos> 13OO
<Damos> 13EPIC FAIL
<Glacymr> 12netbooks are gross
<Damos> 13for drf
<Damos> 13How could you fail to see a problem
<TimeShift> with battery of course. without battery it's half a pound
<Damos> 13I mean your drf
<Glacymr> 12size isn't everything
<Glacymr> 12weight same thing
<Glacymr> 12at least drf is getting a work out
<TimeShift> then again what
<TimeShift> is smarter?
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, 5 pounds is not heavy at all
<Glacymr> 12yeah 5 pounds is childs play
<Glacymr> 12i can lift that much with my tiny finger
<drf|laptop> 03that's with battery too
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah
<TimeShift> if you need to carry 5 pounds for an entire day, it will be VERY heavy after a few hours
<Glacymr> 12he's not carrying it arund
<Glacymr> 12around
<Glacymr> 12its on his lap
<drf|laptop> 03precisely
<drf|laptop> 03also TimeShift, I have a CARRYING CASE
<drf|laptop> 03I've said this enough
<drf|laptop> 03I carry it by a strap on my shoulder.
<TimeShift> as I said: mobility fail
<drf|laptop> 03how is that fail
<drf|laptop> 03it goes with me
<drf|laptop> 03that's fine
<drf|laptop> 03also I have a smartphone if I need som+ething that fits in my pocket
<Damos> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzmh6JfXTtw&NR=1
<Damos> 13Omg new Zoraork commercial
<TimeShift> what if you need to write mails, work on documents, hold presentations, play some small games and connect to a projector, then again watch some videos in the meantime and all whilst you walk from conference to conference, to the park, do so in a restaurant and so on?
<TimeShift> THAT is mobility. Being able to work ANYWHERE you feel

<Arcanine> 04sigh
<Arcanine> 04i hate TS with a passion
<Quilava> ban him while he's not around
<Chimera> TS?
<Arcanine> 04he's one of TST's OPs
<Damos> 13thats freedom
<Arcanine> 04alongside drealen
<TimeShift> what you have is not a mobile computer, it's a portable computer
<Damos> 13I wish I had that
<Chimera> TimeShift
<Chimera> Ah
<drf|laptop> 03yes it's a portable computer
<drf|laptop> 03what's wrong with that
<Chimera> :/
<drf|laptop> 03I use it in the back seat of the van all the time
<Arcanine> 04well
<Arcanine> 04he's like the last person i'd see as a good mod
<Damos> 13you have unlimated internet connection
<Arcanine> 04he's hardly active and he has a temper tantrum whenever things don't go his way
<Damos> 13you probably hacked
<Damos> 13Â¬Â¬
<drf|laptop> 03Damos, I have unlimited too
<Arcanine> 04plus he just loves to disagree with everything
<drf|laptop> 03it's called a phone
<TimeShift> it's not a mobile computer. that yis rhe difference
<drf|laptop> 03what's the point of a netbook if my phone is just as powerful
<Damos> 13a phone is not a laptop
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And he has to flame Ho-Oh >:U
<drf|laptop> 03yes, my laptop is a laptop
<drf|laptop> 03:)
<TimeShift> can you type on your phone with 10 fingers?
<Damos> 13XDDDDDDD
<Arcanine> 04he changed a newbies avatar to an american flag being burned
<Arcanine> 04because he knew the person, hated him, and thought it'd be funny
<Icey> o.o
<drf|laptop> 03no, 2
<Damos> 13just like that fantasic 4 movie with that one scene
<drf|laptop> 03I can't type on netbooks to save my life
<Arcanine> 04hi
<drf|laptop> 03even with like 4 fingers
<TimeShift> and only fools are being hacked ;)
<drf|laptop> 03stupid tiny keyboards
<Icey> hio
<Damos> 13LOL
<Damos> 13imagine if they were tinyer
<Arcanine> 04i think he used the defense that patriotism is silly
<TimeShift> that's why I have a Lenovo netbook. They have almost equally sized keys
<Damos> 13:3
<Arcanine> 04but if i wasn't so afraid of him
<drf|laptop> 03they're still smaller than a normal laptop
<Arcanine> 04i'd call him a nazi to see how it felt, since he lives in germany
<Damos> 13almost?
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't work otherwise, physically
<Chimera> Haha
<Arcanine> 04i've already been told that is among one of the top insults in germany
<TimeShift> well, then you have just fat fingers:P
<Arcanine> 04i hear people get killed over being called that
<drf|laptop> 03I do.
<Espeon> All I know is that he takes things too seriously
<Espeon> 101% of the time
<Espeon> but many people do so
<Damos> 13that just back fired on you Time
*Espeon hides
<Arcanine> 04Espeon
<Arcanine> 04he is serious about what other people do
<TimeShift> eh?
<Arcanine> 04but when it comes to his actions he's allowed to be all fun and games
<Arcanine> 04the evidence is in that american flag thing
<Espeon> Yeah, that was quite frankly <censored> up
<Arcanine> 04yet he demodded kyu
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sounds like another admin on that site
<Arcanine> 04for saying a non-swear word
<Espeon> o-o
<Espeon> I missed that
<Arcanine> 04that silly word that was made up in a spam spree
<Espeon> lol
<Damos> 13hey Airy
<Arcanine> 04kyu was demodded and kicked for saying that word once in front of TS
<Espeon> well that I personally could agree with if it was just a joke, but I guess it wasn't
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That bleugh-somethi?
<Airwolve> someone nommed the DNS
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02somethin*
<Espeon> oh, I remember that xD
<Damos> 13Dns?
<Espeon> I just forgot it for some reason. The Kyu thing
<Arcanine> 04then when articuno came in and fixed everything up
<Damos> 13hi Blacky
<Black_Latios> 02heya everyone :P
<Arcanine> 04TS left in rage for a couple weeks
<Espeon> <<
<Trace> omg i like the remix of this song better than the original and thats really bad..
<Arcanine> 04his little art contest with nick, same thing
<Espeon> Oh, when he forgot the uppercase S or something..?
<Arcanine> 04he pulled a big hissyfit because the s wasn't capped
*Damos 13give Black_Latios a cookie
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Neko> heh tst
<Espeon> you don't complain over something you get for free
<Espeon> unless it's AIDS
<Neko> :x
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Black_Latios> 02:o
<Arcanine> 04sometimes you have to pay for that too :P
*Black_Latios eats the cookie and licks her lips
<Neko> yep
<Arcanine> 04anyway
<Espeon> well you probably have bigger chances getting it if you pay :P
*Espeon flails
<Arcanine> 04i can't stand the guy
<Espeon> but yeah
<Arcanine> 04and i think arti is a fool for keeping him an admin
<Espeon> I don't really understand what gets people picked as mods/admins there
<Arcanine> 04arti picks favorites
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Obviously
<Espeon> well duh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Then ignores the rest
<Lostcase> anyone?
<Arcanine> 04then tries to use timezones as a justification
<Espeon> inactivity or actual suitability can go to hell !
*Espeon flails
<Evil0ne> ?
<TwitchEd> did you install BootMii
<TwitchEd> ?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Her new rule seems to be: 1. Screw the rules
<Arcanine> 04i know she tried to cover people she trusted
<Espeon> well still not as bad as giving mod/admin to people for recruiting new members. But still sorta silly.
<Arcanine> 04yet round out timezones so there was an active member at most times of the day
<Arcanine> 04but that didn't really work out
<Espeon> are there any like Azn mods? o.O
<Espeon> as in LIVES in Asia
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So how did you get your modship?
<Arcanine> 04i don't think there are even any asia members period
<Arcanine> 04besides jerry
<Espeon> um
<Arcanine> 04and eXAKR
<Espeon> yeah that's what I was about to say
<Espeon> xD
<Arcanine> 04neither are active enough
*Shiny-Growlithe points to Arcanine
<TimeShift> gosh, one french guy added me as a buddy...well...asked for it...
<Arcanine> 04and jerry has been banned before
<Espeon> eXAKR is like a permanent lurker. And oh? I didn't know that o.O
<Arcanine> 04he was a real annoyance in the past
<drf|laptop> 03wow, why so racist?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm part French :/
<TimeShift> ....reading through his profile...bleh, this guy's english SUCKS. proves french people speak only two languages
<Espeon> uh
<TimeShift> well, french people speak french.....and french
*Glacymr cough, stereotype, cough
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Reminds me of...
<TimeShift> that's not a stereotype, that's a proven fact
<Espeon> that's like saying "X system gamers suck!" based on one person playing.
*Espeon flails
<LaptopAristeo> hehe

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Moonlight Lugia and Lugia519
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<TimeShift> I flew with Air France when I was on my way to America. The pilots announced everything both in english and in french. I'm maybe quite good at english and terrible at french, but I understoff the pilot BETTER whilst he spoke french....
*Skylands talks to Lugia519 on Facebook often
<Skylands> 10/random
<Espeon> So many Lugia<numbers>
<eXAKR> Accents
<TimeShift> PLUS: french pilots are just HATED all over europe due to their attitute at all towers
<Arcanine> 04i guess Lyon is in australia
<Arcanine> 04that is close enough to asia
<Skylands> 10Lugia719, lulz @Espeon
<eXAKR> lol
<TimeShift> not accents, it's just a fact: French guys can't speak english
<Espeon> well true
<Arcanine> 04as far as time zones are concerned
<Espeon> so yeah no matter what time someone will be lurking
<TimeShift> they just can't. Not even if their life demands it
<Arcanine> 04actually using timezone rounding theories
<Arcanine> 04Lyon would be a perfect mod
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But gah, once ML and 591 came onto TST's chat and spammed/flooded that place
<eXAKR> I hear that the French are the most stuck-up people in the world
<Arcanine> 04you think that is bad?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<Arcanine> 04check out the PO server i host for HoR
<TimeShift> did you know they even have a law to prevent too much other languages to invade France?
<FlameLugia> i hear their military sucks
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But it made me hate them both after that
<Arcanine> 04every once inawhile the official beta server crashes
<Espeon> LOL
<Arcanine> 04and everyone decides to go to HoR'S server
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<Arcanine> 04Espeon is my witness to that
<drf|laptop> 03let's not be racist, OK?
<Espeon> shiver-worthy
<drf|laptop> 03I also heard all Germans were Nazis, so?
*drf|laptop runs for his life

<Espeon> he was like "Hey give me 20 wins and I'll get on my other acc and give you them back". Lets just say after playing 50 HEADSHOT FOR PRESTIGE LOBBY of warfare 2 I'm not that stupid
<eXAKR> Pity that they have such a beautiful language and city

<Espeon> That kind of mustache is now officially the "Hitler 'tache" forever
<Glacymr> 12isn't it a bit scary
<TimeShift> kinda funny how you use a name without ever knowing what this person was or what it exactly did to an entire continent and a culture as common as a simple qoute
<Soyuz> Skyland's trying to take over the world :O
<Espeon> I love how she always wants all three

<eXAKR> And the Swastika
<Glacymr> 12that Adolf rhymes with Rudolph
<eXAKR> oo
<eXAKR> I'm going to name my children Adolf

<Skylands> 101[18:14] <@Espeon> I love how she always wants all three 10<- I just do it for the lulz
<eXAKR> Raise them as Buddhists, which uses a Swastika as a holy symbol

<eXAKR> Whut

<TimeShift> back to a question: Did you know Hitler wasn't german at all?
<Lucario> ra
<eXAKR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo <- This is sudo rm -rf
<Bloatedfish> hitler was australian
<Lucario> He was as german as apple strudel
<Espeon> Austrian iirc
<TimeShift> correct Espeon
<Bloatedfish> no, that's an australian cover-up
*Shiny-Growlithe uses Destiny Bond on Espeon
<Espeon> LOL
<eXAKR> oo
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Mine, back off :U
<Bloatedfish> bad for tourism
<Bloatedfish> MATE
<Lucario> No he was german as he said, austria IS germany. then he invaded it
<FlameLugia> !espeon
*Espeon still belongs to eXAKR for 3 more minutes
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That's why he liked blond haired peoplez
<FlameLugia> aw
<Bloatedfish> and this is why you should never trust Australians
<Lucario> where is arti?
<Espeon> I bet someone first mistyped Austria as Australia when he/she spoke about Fritzl, and so a stupid meme was born.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Gone
*FlameLugia shall have to wait
<Soyuz> Arcanine; Rudolph Hess, the Nazi Raindeer
*eXAKR deflates Bloatedfish
<Glacymr> 12the one thing that i don't understand about WW1 and WW2 was France's actions
*eXAKR inflates Bloatedfish with helium gas
<eXAKR> lolFrance
<Espeon> flying feesh
<Bloatedfish> I wasn't thinking of a meme, but the meme was probably intentional rather than a typo.
<Glacymr> 12oh no the germans are hostile, let's build a wall between us
<Glacymr> 12darnit they went around
<Glacymr> 12WW2, oh no let's build a wall again, maybe it'll work this time
<FlameLugia> france est tres stupid
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02This time let's throw our paintings at them |D
<Espeon> I can imagine it.
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Ohgod there needs to be a picture of this
<Arcanine> 04you know
<Bloatedfish> nazi germany based a lot of it's strategy on the writings of french generals...
<Soyuz> Yes
<Arcanine> 04i wouldn't be surprised if that is a logical reaction
<Arcanine> 04considering how they black noses treated him
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Soyuz> say it was originally by Soyuz
<Arcanine> 04*the
<Soyuz> Arcanine; in the North pole
<Soyuz> its the 1950s
<FlameLugia> but the french military sucks
<Lucario> run away?
<Espeon> oh I see, Rupolph is a ginger.
<Espeon> just his nose
<Espeon> not his hair
<Glacymr> 12FlameLugia
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh I thought he was supposed to be Indian/Native American
<Glacymr> 12play one of them in chess
<Espeon> because red fur would be sorta strange
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Y'know, red nose and all
<Glacymr> 12see who wins D:
<FlameLugia> yes
<Lucario> ahh yeah the french generals said 'In a war you have to run very fast' and the germans took it the wrong way and the blitzkrieg was born
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Santa having his white beard being the leader of them all
<Soyuz> Espeon; gingers dont have souls =O
<Bloatedfish> lolol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hurrdurr

<Glacymr> 12LOL
<Espeon> Santa FLOOFBEARD
<FlameLugia> the french in war are like me in mw2
<Soyuz> Shiny; then Sanats is...a typical white politican?
<Glacymr> 12FlameLugia
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02MY FLOOFBEARD
<Glacymr> 12except they don't come back to life after they die
<TimeShift> well, the germans won the war, because they built the better war machinery
<Glacymr> 12XD
*Shiny-Growlithe flamethrowers Santa
<FlameLugia> spray your guns like crazy without aiming, just hope you hit them, than run like hell
<Espeon> I don't think Commando exists irl.
*Espeon hides
<Espeon> if it does, WE'RE ALL DOOMED
<Lucario> germans won?
<Skylands> 10:O
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Sorta
<Lucario> i thought getting bombed to bits was losing
<FlameLugia> i have commando pro
<TimeShift> french guys built large, heavy tanks, the germans built small, lighter, more mobile tanks. Therefore france was taken quite swiftly because the germans were more mobile
<Skylands> 10It was super effective
<Soyuz> an OLD white person?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02yes
<Glacymr> 12no
<Glacymr> 12you can not compare this to laptops
<Glacymr> 12D:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02and yes it was
<TimeShift> honestly, I believe if the allies didn't have stopped Hitler, the germans would have done themselves
<TimeShift> think about Stauffenberg
<Espeon> For some reason I thought of santa and (destiny) bond(age) in the same sentence
<Lucario> The german people loved hitler
<Espeon> I cried a little inside
<Glacymr> 12TimeShift
<Glacymr> 12weren't the germans already trying?
<Neko> heh
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Those elves are getting to you Espeon
<Soyuz> LOL I just thought of something
<FlameLugia> the nazis divided by zero
<Soyuz> "Espeon; he floofed for your sins!"
<TimeShift> they loved him in the beginning. But during war, waay too much bad things happened
<FlameLugia> and hitler appeared, he became their new god
<Glacymr> 12well duh
<Espeon> I imagined Santa in latex gear riding his sleight now. "Oh, the good ol' suit is dirty"
<Glacymr> 12before the war he did good things
*Espeon shot from space
<Lucario> like losing
<Bloatedfish> <FlameLugia> and hitler appeared, he became their new god
<Espeon> Before the war he did controversial but not THAT sort of things so to say
<Bloatedfish> ^wat
<TimeShift> did you ever see what kind of people they pushed into the war machinerey? Pushed into the boots of soldiers and onto the ships and submarines? Most of them were still children, few of them older than 20
<Lucario> if he won they would have loved him
<FlameLugia> well if that happened now timeshift
<FlameLugia> im pretty sure kids would be like hell yes
<Glacymr> 12kids have a lot of energy D:
<FlameLugia> due to most of them thinking they are cool playing fps
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Damn you neighborhood watch committee!
<Glacymr> 12who needs to feed them coffee now
*Yoshino 2floats about
<TimeShift> know what's being said in a documentary? "Only take pictures of returning crews. The people have beards then.....the tommies would be ashamed if they see whom they're finghting. Kids, little boys who belong to the lap of their mother."
*Glacymr gives Yoshino a balloon
<Espeon> Yeah, that will help
*Shiny-Growlithe pounces on Yoshino then sprawls out
*Yoshino 2floats away
<Yoshino> 2hi Shiny~
*Shiny-Growlithe apparently floats with her .-.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hello Yoshino
*Espeon gives Shiny a chocolate bar
<Glacymr> 12i would of said to give them subway sandwiches
<Glacymr> 12it'll confuse them

<Yoshino> 2and hi FL
<Arcanine> 04i have banana split ice cream
<Arcanine> 04i can't wait to see how that tastes
<TimeShift> or why would a leader hide in a bunker close to a main war border and his own troops instead of in the middle of the country, eh?
<Soyuz> what if it tastes like death?
<TimeShift> the answer is simple: He feared his own people more than the enemy
<Arcanine> 04then i won't eat it
<Neko> death
<Neko> taste hmm
<Neko> death of what?

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But it would be funny to randomly say something on his profile
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Noting that we both have Pokemon avatars
<Damos> 13i have no clue
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02:awesomefaceplz:
<Skylands> 10this guy is a troll obivously

<lbiza> i put the shit from \apps in \apps on SD

<TheNOOB> Good, now run CFG from HBC or whatever.
<drf|laptop> 03Draelen, like adding an IP exception for Mibbit so more than 4 people can use it at once?
<lbiza> ok
<Draelen> PM that to me, I won't add it tonight, but should be able to do that tomorrow
<Draelen> Youll need to poke arti to update nest too
<TheNOOB> Make sure you have the HDD in the right USB Port.
<TheNOOB> Then try and mount drive from CFG.
<CobraX83> TheNOOB u have any idea about channel forwarders for games
<TheNOOB> Not a clue.
<CobraX83> k
<TheNOOB> Is it really THAT much of a struggle to use the loader?
<TheNOOB> It takes a whole 10 extra seconds.
<TheNOOB> lol
<CobraX83> no i may just use it if i cant but its not about being lazy i like the look better
<CobraX83> thats all
<TheNOOB> I know what you're saying.
<TheNOOB> Wii menu is outdated anyways.

<lbiza> ok is this freakin cfg loader going to format my drive in FAT32?
<Glacymr> 12never checked to see if arti installed the exception
<Sparky|Dinner> 2and now, I take a temporary leave of absence for the sake of filling my hunger with sustenance.
<TheNOOB> No..
<lbiza> if so... i want nothing to do with this program
<lbiza> ok
<TheNOOB> Just ignore it
<TheNOOB> Choose cancel or whatever
<lbiza> ok so just to confirm
<lbiza> this will not throw off my NTFS drive
<TheNOOB> Don't screw around
<TheNOOB> Accidently formatting = bad.

<TheNOOB> DUnno XD
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<lbiza> damn
<Glacymr> 12today feels like a sunday
*Shiny-Growlithe crawls under Yoshino then sprawls ou
<lbiza> i hit "usb cfg loader" in HMC
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02out*
<TheNOOB> He seems to know what he's doing most of the time.
<Yoshino> 02i hear bats
<Glacymr> 12Yoshino
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02OMG you're right Glacymr O.o I swear I thought today was Sunday
<Watanuki> ?
<Glacymr> 12there was a bat in my house D:
<TheNOOB> Why do I smell a troll.
<Yoshino> 02it's sunday here today
<Yoshino> 02and lol bree
<Yoshino> 02what did you do to it?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02My dad smashed a bat's head with a hammer
<Proto> hi NightHawk
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Because he said that it was flying right at him like it was gonna do something
<Yoshino> 02ew
<NightHawk> heya Proto
<Yoshino> 02makes me think that the head cracked open oAO
*Yoshino shudders
*TheNOOB is going to sleep. :O
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I didn't see it
<Glacymr> 12Shiny-Growlithe
<Glacymr> 12today is saturday D:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I remember that
<Glacymr> 12remember more D:
<lbiza> it looks like it has to be FAT or FAT32 or WBFS
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But for half the day I was like "Oh geeze, I don't wanna go to summer school tomorrow..."
<Glacymr> 12whats the date?
<TheNOOB> CFG should support NTFS
<_DiGiTaL_> i use NTFS with CFGLoader
<TheNOOB> There, a pro!
<lbiza> it does say Loading games from a FAT or NTFS partition
<lbiza> but shit
<lbiza> im just afraid it was tryin to format my ntfs >> fat
<lbiza> i was about to shit myself
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Today's the 10th I guess .-.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I start on the 12th
<Soyuz> Drake; how badly? xD
<lbiza> i was about to shit myself
<lbiza> er shit
<TheNOOB> Be careful.
<Arcanine> 04lol
<lbiza> what im tryin to say is... if i go dvd-r route
<Arcanine> 04i read badly as baldly
<lbiza> whats a good game to test with
<TheNOOB> DVD-R will eventually rape your DVD drive.
<TheNOOB> Any game should work.
<_DiGiTaL_> and if u are softmodded you shouldnt go DVD-R
<Soyuz> XD
<lbiza> ok
<_DiGiTaL_> if you have a hardmod chip in your system then go DVD-R
<TheNOOB> DVD-R is slower aswell.
<vdChild> sooo is there any way to not use a GC controller when using bootmii as ios
<_DiGiTaL_> but Softmod playback with DVD-R is capped at like 3x speed
<TheNOOB> I believe it's 3x
<_DiGiTaL_> Hardmod is 6x speed or so
<lbiza> oh ok
<_DiGiTaL_> so some games you will notice slowdowns and jitters
<_DiGiTaL_> like Mario Kart Wii
<lbiza> well i guess i have to read into hdd method
<_DiGiTaL_> burn it and play it
<_DiGiTaL_> watch the intro stutter
<lbiza> cuz i just about messed up my drive
<vdChild> its digital
<lbiza> fo sho
<TheNOOB> I haven't had a problem with any DVD-R games.
<vdChild> finally someone i know
<TheNOOB> You guys are just impatient XD
<_DiGiTaL_> Hey vdChild
<vdChild> can i pm you
<_DiGiTaL_> Sure
<vdChild> kk
<_DiGiTaL_> my replies will be slow im kind of busy :(
<_DiGiTaL_> lbiza if you NEED to use DVD-R i recommend getting a chip but USB HDD is the way to go and partition your HDD is recommended
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And I keep reading it as "I want it really badly"
<_DiGiTaL_> i have a 1TB that has a FAT32 of 30ishGB and then there is about 900GB of NTFS for Wii games
<_DiGiTaL_> FAT32 is for the homebrew apps/emus and shit
<TheNOOB> lol
<TheNOOB> Thats epic.
<_DiGiTaL_> Makes it easier and you never need the SDcard unless you are loading bootmii
<TheNOOB> That's*
<Yoshino> 02i should try drawing humans >:
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You should
<Yoshino> 02but i find them hard >:

<NightHawk> o.0
<Quilava> eep. yes?
*Quilava was fullscreen <.<;;
<xdpirate> yoyo
<Quilava> did you want something, Acranine?
<xdpirate> What is the newest version of shop channel?
<xdpirate> v19?
<viince> v19 is the newest I've seen
<viince> have not seen a v20
<xdpirate> ok thanks
<xdpirate> it's safe to install the wad onto a softmodded 4.3 wii right?
<viince> if you have nand backup ? idk, let us know...
<xdpirate> oh i meant 4.2***
<xdpirate> sorry
<Kenshou`> is there any way to play backups on a wii WITHOUT modding the inside?
<^Wulfgar^> of course
<xdpirate> Kenshou`, yes
<Kenshou`> ?
<Kenshou`> impossible
<Kenshou`> this isnt dreamcast
<Kenshou`> or ps2
<Kenshou`> swapdisc
<^Wulfgar^> Kenshou`, type ? softmod and follow the appropriate guide
<Kenshou`> wtf
<Kenshou`> really?
<Kenshou`> ? softmod
<^Wulfgar^> really
<xdpirate> yus
*LaptopAristeo watches a movie
<xdpirate> Is it safe to install newest shop channel on a softmodded 4.2 wii?
<Kenshou`> WOW
<Kenshou`> WTF
<Kenshou`> How long has this been like this??
*Proto watches a book
<DeathLok> ? softmod
<^Wulfgar^> quite some time
<xdpirate> like, forever
<Kenshou`> I thought you had to mod the inside
<^Wulfgar^> nope
<Kenshou`> thats why I just bought all my games
<Kenshou`> DAMMIT
<^Wulfgar^> wii + usb hdd = win
<Kenshou`> wow
<callow> oO
<xdpirate> what the hell was that
<Ice> oh
<Ice> probably the um....
<^Wulfgar^> netsplit rejoin
<Ice> yeah
<Ice> bout to say
<xdpirate> aha
<xdpirate> i loled
<Ice> Couldn't think of the word
<Aristeo> Okay, so
<Aristeo> Avatar is an incredibly slow and boring movie the second time around
<Stormy> Heh
<Stormy> I thought that the first time around to be honest
<Aristeo> I liked it the first time
<Aristeo> Maybe because it was new
<Proto> Never seen it
<Stormy> It wasn't /terrible/... I just didn't like any of the characters and the story was really preachy and cliche
<Proto> Don't plan on it I think
<Stormy> But everything looked really pretty
<Proto> SNL had a skit with sigourney and her husband having two people over for dinner
<Proto> avatar was still in theaters iirc
<Proto> and she kept checking reviews online
<Proto> "*sobbing uncontrollably*" "What's wrong dear?" "Someone called it Pocahantas with big blue people!"
*Aristeo really just liked the scenery and the creativity involving the scenery
<Stormy> Ahahaha
<Aristeo> I loved the Morrowind-sense I got from it
<Stormy> The whole time I was watching it I was thinking "Fern Gully"
<Aristeo> xD
<Proto> ahahahahaahha
<Aristeo> Corevette789 might know what I'm talking about
<Stormy> I loved that movie when I was a kid
*Aristeo loved Morrowind and it was like a Morrowind movie almost
<Aristeo> And the big blue indians were pretty :)
*Aristeo liked them
<Proto> That was the one with the tanker truck, right Stormy?
<Stormy> yeah
<Proto> Or the little fairy thing
<Proto> oh
<Stormy> And the fairies
<Stormy> Then I saw Dances With Wolves after
<Stormy> and it was literally
<Stormy> the
<Stormy> exact
<Stormy> same
<Stormy> story
<Aristeo> :3
<Proto> I always liked something in central park, gnome?
<Proto> had the big green thumb
*Aristeo hugs Pandora
*Aristeo doesn't hug the movie
*Proto opens Pandora's lid
*Proto unleashes evil
<Stormy> D:
*Proto wins the game
*Aristeo scoops up the evil and keeps it to himself
<Aristeo> MIEN
*Stormy lost the game :(
<Proto> D:
<Proto> sorry :X
<Proto> :x*
<Stormy> :P
<Aristeo> If you want to lose the game, play Super Mario: The Lost Levels for the SNES
<Stormy> My brother's a pro at Mario
<Stormy> I, on the other hand, suck
<Aristeo> They call them "The Lost Levels" because you will lose at playing those levels
<Aristeo> Peach will not be saved
<Kenshou`> wtf
<Proto> Oh
<Proto> Aristeo, you seen the video of the guy swearing?
<Proto> I think he was playing that level
*Aristeo has seen lots of videos of people swearing
<Corevette789> wut
<Proto> hah
<Aristeo> Corevette789: Did you like Morrowind?
*Aristeo can't remember
<Corevette789> Yes, I do
<Aristeo> Corevette789: Did the Na'vi give you that Ashlander feeling?
<Corevette789> I have it on 3 systems
<Corevette789> Almost
<Corevette789> I kind of think of the same hostile tribal feeling
<xdpirate> Noob question: Can I remove WADs from my SD card when they're done installing, or does it depend on them somehow? I know I need them in order to uninstall, but can I free space on my SD card by just having them on my PC until I need to uninstall them?
<Spyrorocks> anyone know some good sites to download ebooks
<Spyrorocks> Like, paperback books that have been digitized
<Corevette789> Legally?
<Proto> ...
<Kenshou`> I'm assuming only DVD-DL's will work
<Spyrorocks> legally... or not.
<^Wulfgar^> if you're installing wads to nand, then yes, you can remove them from sd
<Aristeo> There's no illegal way to do it -- torrenters don't read
<xdpirate> ^Wulfgar^, thanks
<Stormy> XD
<^Wulfgar^> Kenshou`, dvd-dl for what?
<Aristeo> Unless it's some bood like "The God Delusion"
<Corevette789> The only place I have ever seen them is iTunes (I think) and Demonoid
<Aristeo> book*
<Kenshou`> wii softmod
<Spyrorocks> I refuse to install itunes
<Corevette789> They banned me
<^Wulfgar^> what do you mean?
<xdpirate> Kenshou`, you can play games via USB loading
<lbiza> ok so i have a iso i converted to wbfs and i have a wii in NTFS
<Spyrorocks> itunes is blasphemy to the zune software
<lbiza> is this correct wulfgar?
<Stormy> I find it hard to read more than a couple paragraphs on a screen anyway
<Corevette789> iTunes is spyware
<eXAKR> Deadity
<xdpirate> (USB harddrive, flash memory sticks, etc)
<Spyrorocks> I read all day.
<eXAKR> Well
*Stormy sticks to books
<^Wulfgar^> did you put wbfs in wbfs folder on root of usb hdd?
<lbiza> lemme check
<Aristeo> Spyrorocks: What I do is copy a line of text that I know is in the book I'm looking for, then search it in Google in quotes
<Spyrorocks> let me try it
<Aristeo> I have about a 15-20% success rate with that
<Kenshou`> oh shit
<Kenshou`> wow
<lbiza> no it was in game title folder
<lbiza> it needs to be EXT:\wbfs\<in here?>
<lbiza> can i just simply create a folder on ext hdd called 'wbfs'?
<viince> yes, lowercase
<lbiza> sweet
<Spyrorocks> No success
<Spyrorocks> Oh well.
<Proto> What book is it?
<lbiza> does the .txt file it creates with it from wii manager need to be renamed?
<viince> .txt ?
<Spyrorocks> Maybe ill stop being a cheap skate and spend the $10
<Spyrorocks> lol
<Proto> heh
<Aristeo> Yeah, you'll probably not find it unless it's part of the Twilight series
<lbiza> yeah like it says SDG =
<^Wulfgar^> no...you can leave it
<Proto> ew
<Proto> unless
<Spyrorocks> or harry potter
<lbiza> ok
<Sparky||Reborn> 2and now
<Sparky||Reborn> 2I go to bed
<Proto> it /is/ part of the Twilight series?
<Proto> o_o
<^Wulfgar^> your wbfs file and txt file should be in it's own folder, inside the wbfs folder...
<Sparky||Reborn> 2and realize that I never actually changed my nick two hours ago
<lbiza> 10-4
<Spyrorocks> shut up. Its none of your business i like the twilight series.
<viince> you can rename the .wbfs like 'whatever you want [SDGE01].wbfs'
<Stormy> The music they play on the radio at this time of night is terrible... >.>
<Aristeo> Yeah >.<
<Spyrorocks> you need sirius
<Aicebo> HELLO EVERYONE.
<Stormy> o hai

<Proto> heh
<Stormy> It worked, but my volume was up so high I probably woke up everyone. XD
<lbiza> is there a tut for setting cfg to mount
<lbiza> im lost lol
*Stormy plugs in headphones
<Aicebo> XDDDD
<Stormy> holy [censored], I should have turned the volume down
<Stormy> Now it just blasted in my ears XDD
<^Wulfgar^> lbiza, you can find a list of options for CFGLoader here: http://gwht.wikidot.com/configurable-options
<Aicebo> XD
<Aristeo> Oooooooooh, you're *right at* 1000

<Arcanine> 04sorry if i interrupted something important
<^Wulfgar^> no
<^Wulfgar^> the readme is a readme
<^Wulfgar^> you need to edit the config
<lbiza> 10-4
<Aicebo> I even had fish today and the ice machine on the fridge is fixed and it's no longer boiling hot outside and I finally got my freaking ag shirt in the mail and got to go to the beach and NOW 1000 SUBS JEEZ IT'S AMAZING
<Miigotu> wiiflow is easier xD
<Miigotu> and prettier
<lbiza> ok so in config file i can just put # partition = [WBFS1] on the bottom of it?
<lbiza> and save it
<Miigotu> lol

<Arcanine> 04sigh my prediction failed me f
<lbiza> i mean
<lbiza> [NTFS]
<Arcanine> 04for once

<Miigotu> idk if its the bottom line or not
<Aicebo> heehee

<lbiza> partition = NTFS1
<Stormy> it's over 1000!!! *shot*

<lbiza> der #device
<Aicebo> I actually have this really crappy video from like last year I was just looking at and
<Aicebo> it has over 9000 views
<Miigotu> wiiflow does this for you auto matically lol
<Aicebo> it's really weird

<Aristeo> .... :o
<Aicebo> ...XD
<|Shadow|> lbiza, the config.txt doesnt need manual edditing
<|Shadow|> wiiflowintothetrash
<Quilava> :/
<Aristeo> Stormy! What does the YouTube say about her view count?
<Quilava> also I haven't gotten the game to work yet on this comp..
<Aicebo> XDDDD!
<Aicebo> Total Upload Views: 192,690
*Stormy looks at Aicebo's youtube profile
<Stormy> ...and for some odd reason everything's in Russian so I can't read anything
<Aicebo> ...LOL
<Stormy> Stupid proxy :P
<Miigotu> lol |Shadow| have you even tried wiiflow recently?
<Miigotu> has everything cfg has ^^
<Arcanine> 04what do you mean you can't get it to work?
<Arcanine> 04sigh
<Arcanine> 04i'm trying to make a tank nasus
<Arcanine> 04item build is everything but i can't find the right build
<Kenshou`> hey
<Aicebo> http://comments.deviantart.com/1/114899207/1563970371
<Kenshou`> If I see a boy and his blob the game at 1.5GB [scrubbed] and another at 4GB which one is the one I should obtain?
<Stormy> XD Poor Cynder
*Aristeo wonders how Stormy can connect here with a proxy
<Aicebo> :D
<Stormy> I'm only using a proxy on Firefox
<Quilava> I meant the patcher crashed every time I open it
<Aristeo> ohhhhhhh
<Arcanine> 04oh
<Quilava> I went through some tutorial on how to fix it, haven't tested yet
<Arcanine> 04perhaps you should check the site for support
<Arcanine> 04oh
<Arcanine> 04so you did
<|lucid|> doesnt matter if you are putting it on usb drive
<Stormy> Port 6667 doesn't block at 10:30 so I can stay signed into here without one
<Arcanine> 04i tested nasus with some new items today XD
<Corevette789> badger
<Quilava> ohey it works.
<Arcanine> 04the match lasted an hour
<Quilava> sweet
<Arcanine> 04so i thought i might as well
<Aristeo> Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.
<Stormy> I wonder how my parents haven't figured that out yet...
<Arcanine> 04i was walking around with stark's and malady on him, as well as sunfire cape lol
<Quilava> wits end is awesome.
<where> nou
<Arcanine> 04i use wits end on teemo
<Arcanine> 04it is indeed fun
<Stormy> ...lol
<Aristeo> Albert Camus
<Stormy> Who?
<Aristeo> The person who originated that quote
<Aristeo> You didn't think I was creative enough to come up with that myself, did you? :P
<Arcanine> 04so many times have i ambushed a caster XD
<Stormy> Well no :P
<Stormy> But I've never heard the name before
<Arcanine> 04removed most of their mana, they try to auto attack me then i blind them
<Aristeo> Ohhhhh
<Aristeo> Well
<DasTier> Kenshou`: wiidiscs are generally filled up with junk data so that they are always 4GB, scrubbing means removing the junk while keeping the game intact
<Kenshou`> [NTSC][ScRuBBeD].wbfs
<Aristeo> He was a French philosopher back in the 18th century I think
<Stormy> Ah
<Aristeo> Oh, wait no, 20th
<Arcanine> 04btw cleanse is broken dude lol
<Glacymr> 12ROARA
<Quilava> what do you mean?
*Aurora breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
<Arcanine> 04its insanely good
<Kenshou`> oh ok
<Aristeo> An interesting thinker
<Arcanine> 04i think besides teleport its my favorite summoner skill
<Glacymr> 12yay
<Spyrorocks> for a second I read that as "beauty is unbeardable"
<Glacymr> 12sorry i have no cheese
<Kenshou`> do games run/load faster on disc, usb drive or SD card?
<Aurora> been holding that in for two weeks now D:
<Glacymr> 12really?
<DasTier> disc is limited to 3x DVD speed
<DasTier> usb is faster than SD
<Aurora> 6minus a couple hundred e's
<Glacymr> 12how goes?
<Aurora> 6pretty well
<Aurora> 6been busy as heck
<Glacymr> 12oh
*where stokes his beard sagely
<Aurora> 6just said goodbye to a close friend once again, cried a few buckets
<Glacymr> 12don't worry
<where> strokes^
<Glacymr> 12you can always be more busy
<where> >.>
<Aurora> 6and now my life goes back to my life
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Aurora> 6these two weeks have been so abnormal, it's wierd
<Quilava> heh
<Glacymr> 12i haven't seen kyu talk in ages
<Miigotu> usb is faster than burnt disc ^
<Aurora> 6he's busy with stoofs
<Quilava> I heard it got nerfed quite a bit recently too.
<Glacymr> 12i figured
<Quilava> that or it was a while ago
<Glacymr> 12this week has been abnormal for me as well :/
<Glacymr> 12did i mention the bat?
<DasTier> usb2 is also faster than the wii sd slot afaik
<Miigotu> only retail disc is faster than usb, since the dvd drive can go 6x
<Arcanine> 04nerfed?
<Quilava> they made it less effective.
<Arcanine> 04dunno but its still good
<xdpirate> Which games works good on Wii64?
<Arcanine> 04i was facing off against mr. time
<Arcanine> 04whats his name?
<Miigotu> yeah, its dependant on the usb drive performance itself tho
<Quilava> zilean or something like that
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<xdpirate> Does Mario Kart run at a playable speed?
<Stormy|Sleeping> Good night everyone
<Aicebo> gnitee
<Arcanine> 04he kept putting bombs on me and i kept cleansing them off XD
<Quilava> he's annoying considering he only has one combat skill
<Stormy|Sleeping> 2:10 AM here >.>
<Miigotu> i imagine it would take 2 minutes to try it xdpirate
<Aristeo> nini Stormy|Sleeping!
<Miigotu> rather than asking
<Quilava> I should probably play more often :|
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6dunno
<xdpirate> Haven't downloaded neither the emulator nor the roms because I'd like to know if it works before I do, and if it has good compatibility :)
<Arcanine> 04Nasus's first ability got PUMPED that game
<Aurora> 6I might have been here and saw the conversation, but was quiet
<Arcanine> 04the bonus was like +70
<Quilava> thats pretty good
<Arcanine> 04really good
<y007ghg7> hi
<Arcanine> 04considering i was hitting turrets and champions for 190
<Arcanine> 04plus sheen
<Quilava> is 190 a lot for that skill? :|
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12thursday i found a bat in the house
<Arcanine> 04rank 5 is 110 + whatever
<Arcanine> 04i'll let you be the judge of that
<Quilava> I dunno much about the statistics <.>
<Aurora> 6o-o
<Arcanine> 04i know i never gotten it that high before
<|Shadow|> <Miigotu> only retail disc is faster than usb, since the dvd drive can go 6x <-WRONG
<Quilava> ah
<Glacymr> 12yes
<Glacymr> 12you know those black things
<Aurora> 6yes
<Glacymr> 12pretty random actually -.-
<DasTier> I thought usb2 should be faster than 6x DVD but wasn't sure ;)
<Miigotu> how is that wrong?
<|Shadow|> usb is fater
<Aurora> 6uh...yeah
<Arcanine> 04let's say it was 70 though
<Aurora> 6IN the house?
<|Shadow|> faster*
<Arcanine> 04i had to 2 my way upto that
<Aicebo> I think I'll go now too gnite
<Miigotu> dependant on the usb hdd itself
<Arcanine> 04so that was 35 kills with Siphoning Strike?
<Quilava> yeah
<|Shadow|> usb is always faster
<Quilava> he needs cooldown reduction :|
<DasTier> in that case it's dependant on the retail disc too, lots of scratches makes it slow :P
<Miigotu> agreed ^
<Arcanine> 04i have an item that reduces his cooldown by 20
<Arcanine> 04%
<Quilava> nice.
<Arcanine> 04something shroud?
<y007ghg7> guys if i brick and i ave bootmii as boot 2 how do i get into bootmii?
<Arcanine> 04Glacial Shroudedit this page
<|Shadow|> boot the wii
<dlukz> power on with reset?
<Arcanine> 04-edit this page XD
<|Shadow|> liek u normaly would
<DasTier> with the bootmii sdcard in the slot
<Quilava> lol
<y007ghg7> ok
<|Shadow|> dlukz, wrong
<dlukz> oh
<dlukz> <-- guessed :p
<Quilava> actually I might be up for a game right now.
<y007ghg7> wait
<Quilava> I haven't been going to sleep till late ><
<Arcanine> 04i can't seem to get connected
<Miigotu> but, 1. we dont reach full usb2 speed
<^Wulfgar^> boot wii with bootmii sd inserted
<Quilava> oh. its down :/
<y007ghg7> with bootmii as boot2 will i see the bootmii screen every time?
<Glacymr> 12yes
<Quilava> sucks
<Miigotu> 2. not all apps support usb2
<Glacymr> 12it was flying around and hanging from the ceiling
<^Wulfgar^> only if you have the bootmii folder on your sd
<|Shadow|> usb is always faster no matter how much u want to fundy fuck it
<Miigotu> lol ok, obviously you dont know much about the actual code
<DasTier> Miigotu: usb1 is faster already, and usbloaders support usb2
<|Shadow|> n00b we arnt talking apps
<Glacymr> 12getting it out of the house was hard as heck as well
<Miigotu> so i will say ur right to make u happy
<|Shadow|> we r talking wii games off usb
<Arcanine> 04:/
*Arcanine squeaks
<Miigotu> usbloader = app
*Quilava squeaks back
<Aurora> 6ugh
<Miigotu> and no, all of them dont support usb2
<|Shadow|> yea be that little republican that u so much r
<Arcanine> 04i had too much action this week >_>
<Quilava> what do you mean?
<DasTier> all don't or not all do?
<Arcanine> 04thursday
<Arcanine> 04when i found the bat in the house
<Miigotu> not all of them*
<Arcanine> 04that was just too much excitement
<eXAKR> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d2stnhm
<|Shadow|> yea wiiflow doesnt
<eXAKR> !deshou
*Kyu throws a Shaymin at eXAKR , deshou
<Miigotu> wiiflow does ^
<Miigotu> u seem like ur not very up to date on ur information
<Miigotu> lol
<Glacymr> 12hi eXAKR
<|Shadow|> thats not it
<eXAKR> hi
<|Shadow|> its jsut wiiflow is shit
<Miigotu> if u say so
<Glacymr> 12how goes wild eXAKR of doom
<^Wulfgar^> cfg > *
<Quilava> ah.
<Miigotu> i think its funny ppl say cfg is better
<Miigotu> we run the same loading code
<Arcanine> 04Sheen is an Item in League of Legends. With it, a player's next physical attack deals +80% more base damage.
<DasTier> guys this is neither a penis size discussion nor rocket science
<Miigotu> even funnier, nothing new is coming to cfg
<^Wulfgar^> loading code isn't all of it
<Arcanine> 04so... add that to the 190
<DasTier> technically USB can be faster and realistically you can screw up at many places to make it slow
<Quilava> you have to use it though :/
<Miigotu> exactly,
<Arcanine> 04i know
<Miigotu> on the wii usb is not always faster
<Quilava> that's +352 damage.
<Arcanine> 04wait
<Arcanine> 04its passive
<^Wulfgar^> wiiflow is for kids and people that just want to press A and play a game...which CAN be done in cfgloader as well
<Miigotu> most times, but there are factors you need to consider
<Quilava> how does it activate?
<DasTier> it nowhere is, regarding the fact I can always put a few wait() into my code :P
<|Shadow|> its always faster then retail dvd
<Miigotu> erm, you havent seen wiiflow lately i guess
<Arcanine> 04it activates when you use an ability
<Quilava> oh
<Miigotu> but thats ok
<^Wulfgar^> I don't put garbage on my usb
<Miigotu> nand emu coming next btw
<^Wulfgar^> Miigotu = wiiflow fanboy fucktard imo
<Miigotu> and showing roms in coverflow and direct launching them to emulators
<Miigotu> im not a fanboy im a dev
<Miigotu> on wiiflow
<lbiza> i want to send a special shotout to wulfgar,miigotu,Cobra and esp Shadow for helping me
<lbiza> thank u all very much for helping this work
<Arcanine> 04i think i might give up on making Trinity Force when playing Nasus
<Quilava> trinity force isn't even that good..
<Arcanine> 04then again
<Quilava> its too low power/balance
<Arcanine> 04on cast, increases your base Attack Damage by 130% for one attack. apparently is part of its effect
<Miigotu> so u can say all u want about wiiflow, we have the first stable release in 9 months very recently
<DasTier> Miigotu: well in that case you have to agree you can't judge objectively, unless you were a dev on all other loaders aswell
<Miigotu> 80% of it is rewritten
<Arcanine> 04so it boosts blow even more
<^Wulfgar^> first 'stable' release...lol
<Miigotu> i talk to the devs of cfg and gx daily
<Quilava> ehh
<Miigotu> gx has uber problems atm
<^Wulfgar^> talking != dev
<Miigotu> and cfg there is nothing planned
<Quilava> wouldn't you rather just get a +attack item for way less?
<Miigotu> cfg and wiiflow use the same exact loader code ^
<^Wulfgar^> there's no need to add anything
<DarkLink> I got a new message in Gecko OS just now. Right as it's about to start my game this comes up: "This Game Requires IOS 38" "Install IOS38-64-v3609.wad?"
<Arcanine> 04true
<Quilava> hell you could get infinity edge for less, +80 to all attacks
<Quilava> plus 250% criticals
<Miigotu> except we support more thaings now
<Arcanine> 04it's just that i've been building force
<Arcanine> 04because i have sheen anyway
<^Wulfgar^> the more you 'add' the more to go wrong
<Quilava> also, is it a unique ability? they might not stack
<Galaxy|> means you don't have the requisite IOS
<Miigotu> not if ts added correctly
<Arcanine> 04i dunno i think my build is more DPS Nasus, i want tank Nasus
<^Wulfgar^> it's a usb loader... designed to load backups off usb...nothing more, nothing less
<Quilava> leviathan?
<Miigotu> in 2 months r-win and I took wiiflow from dead and fixed every bug, and got it up to date with the latest features, and then some
<DarkLink> What should I do? I'm on FW 4.1
<DasTier> well apparently that next version of wiiflow aims at doing more than that wulf
<^Wulfgar^> good for you
<Arcanine> 04dunno
<Arcanine> 04i think i like Warmog more
<Quilava> stats?
<Miigotu> and if you think a loader should just load wii games thats ur preference
<DasTier> whether that's good or bad is a matter of personal opinion really
<^Wulfgar^> DasTier, why bother? there is already a nand emulator...and there are emus for roms, etc...use the app for what it was designed for...no need to reinvent the wheel
<Miigotu> but wiiflow will be a wii menu replacement
<Galaxy|> DarkLink: get NUSD and make the wad and install it
<Galaxy|> simple enough
<Galaxy|> !wb NUSD
<IOS61> NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
<Arcanine> 04+770 Health
<IOS61> NUS Downloader, or NUSD, is a PC Utility designed to allow easy access to the resources present on Nintendo's Update Servers. Using this tool, you can download, pack, and decrypt many system titles into WADs ready to install.
<Arcanine> 04+30 Health Regen (per 5)
<DasTier> ^Wulfgar^: that would be my opinion too but that still doesn't make me say bah bah to their efforts
<Arcanine> 04Passive 	 Permanently gain 3.6 Health and .5 Health Regen per 5 sec per minion kill. Champion kills grant 36 Health and 5 Health Regen per 5 sec. Bonuses cap at +450 Health, and +62.5 Health Regen per 5.
<Miigotu> so if thats not what u want, then dont spam that wiiflow is shit, its just not ur style
<Quilava> nice
<Quilava> no reason you can't get both though
<lbiza> cfg works for me
<DarkLink> Could that be why my Wii hangs at a black screen when I try to launch the game from the Disc Channel?
<Arcanine> 04dunno
<Miigotu> cfg always works
<Quilava> that -15% damage would be really helpful
<Arcanine> 04i think i would get warmog early
<DarkLink> Also, I think it's trying to get the WAD from the disc itself.
<Arcanine> 04then work on lifesteal
<Miigotu> the point of nandemu is that triiforce gui sucks, and you need to switch apps to look at the rest of ur games
<Quilava> if you're tank, your attack will be lowish, making lifesteal not so great
<DasTier> even the usb loading part of neogamma works for me, this isn't about "right" or "wrong" but about eyecandy
<Arcanine> 04he starts out with 10% lifesteal though
<DarkLink> i already have nusd btw
<Miigotu> our aim is all WW,Wii,nes,snes,n64, all in one place in different views
<DarkLink> The game is ACCF
<Galaxy|> that would explain the black screen yes
<Galaxy|> no IOS present
<Quilava> could get starks
<Galaxy|> install IOS38
<Quilava> helps teammates too
<DarkLink> from the disc
<Arcanine> 04indeed
<DarkLink> or nusd?
<mircnoob> ? list
<Arcanine> 04i dunno there is too many ways to take this
<Arcanine> 04i know i have to start with Mana Crystal and Mana Potion because he uses Mana like crazy
<Miigotu> i tend to think wiiflow's coverflow looks better, thats why i joined the project
<Quilava> yeah I get that problem too
<Miigotu> it has a good base
<Quilava> I used to use clarity until I replaced it with ignite
<Miigotu> GX is just too cluttered and bug prone
<Miigotu> and i dont knock cfg at all, its just not gonna get much better anytime soon
<Arcanine> 04you know ignite might be fun with teemo
<Arcanine> 04okay take ignites damage AND poison
<Quilava> ..and malady
<y007ghg7> link to wad manager 1.5 pl0x
<Arcanine> 04malady i believe is the 2nd item i try getting when i teemo
<Miigotu> filetrip.net
<Miigotu> LOL
<y007ghg7> :|
<Arcanine> 04i go for berserkers first
<Quilava> I get lifesteal amulet >bfsword > starks > chaos here >end
<Quilava> I never really know where to go after that, lol
<Arcanine> 04lol
<DasTier> I would be all for a decent loader library and then anyone can add whatever frontend they like, but that's a programmer talking ;)
<^Wulfgar^> http://filetrip.net/f6031-WAD-Manager-1-5.html
<DasTier> that said...
<Arcanine> 04i certainly like Nasus, i just need to think about how to play him
<Miigotu> anyways going back to making wiiflow write to playlog
<DasTier> Miigotu: which wbfsfile implementation is currently the one that works? there are so many forks floating around
<Miigotu> well, the loader behind each usbloader is custom to each x.X
<DarkLink> i'll go with the one on the disc
<DarkLink> thankies
<DarkLink> :D
<Quilava> hmm
<Miigotu> the big 3 all basically use the same thing
<Miigotu> but gx has converted theirs to c++
<Arcanine> 04i just want a good tank i can play
<Miigotu> cfg and wiiflow share the same
<Quilava> I can't play anything melee :(
<Arcanine> 04because what i do during char selection is that i watch what my team-mates pick
<Arcanine> 04i count the number of squishies and tanks and try to pick between teemo or nasus off that count
<Quilava> are you any good with skillshots?
<Arcanine> 04no
<Quilava> oh :/
<Miigotu> and, what to you mean by : which wbfsfile implementation
<Arcanine> 04it's just that i think that if i can learn to juggle 2 characters
<Arcanine> 04it should help win more matches
<Miigotu> libwbfs? wbfs_fat?
<Arcanine> 04there is no point in picking teemo if the other 4 team-mates are also squishies
<Quilava> I need a character that can disable opponents :/
<DasTier> libwbfs with wbfsfile patchset, portable and unbroken (all I tested so far were broken on x86_64 for various reasons)
<Quilava> and if everyone plays well, you don't need a tank :|
<Miigotu> just snag it from cfg source
<Arcanine> 04no matter how well they play
<Miigotu> it has alot of fixes
<DasTier> you sure they care about compatibility to non-wii platforms?
<Arcanine> 04if your opponents have a more rounded team, you are at an instant disadvantage
<Quilava> how so?
<Miigotu> hmm, mb not
<Arcanine> 04just think about it, a team needs a tank, someone to take the damage away from the squishies so they can overwhelm the opponents
<Miigotu> you planning on building a lib? lol
<Quilava> unless nobody attacks the tank
<Quilava> which is usually what ends up happening
<Arcanine> 04that's why a good tank has a good harassing move
<Arcanine> 04something to draw their attention
<Quilava> plus, if I'm fed enough, I can solo a tank in a relatively short ammount of time
<Miigotu> i havent looked at our wbfs stuff for like my last 60 commits, working on adding uloader's unique features to wiiflow atm
<Arcanine> 04cho'gath has that one ability
<Arcanine> 04that makes spikes come from the ground
<DasTier> it is a lib but in the end, yes, for what I want to do I'm exporting the libwbfs functionality as an so/dll, but all codebases I looked at so far were not portable
<Arcanine> 04feral scream is annoying as well
<Quilava> he has a lot of good debuffs :/
<Quilava> slow, stun, silence
<Arcanine> 04Rammus XD
<Miigotu> i dount one exists that will work for that out of the box
<Arcanine> 04he FORCES you to attack him by taunting
<Quilava> he's just annoying D:
<Miigotu> doubt*
<Arcanine> 04i've played him a lot, he can't push for heck
<Miigotu> for dolphin?
<Quilava> thats why he sits near a tower all the time
<Arcanine> 04i know
<Arcanine> 04then if a tower goes down then you have problems
<DasTier> right but for example the sources of wbfs_file (which even was meant for being run on a PC) are suggesting an ancient glibc version from 2008 ;)
<Quilava> I've seen him push when fed, but eh
<Arcanine> 04Nasus
<Arcanine> 04he has spirit fire XD
<Miigotu> lol
<DasTier> there must be something in between "completely backwards" and "fully working" ;)
<Arcanine> 04plus he can always tap into his ulti
<Miigotu> i honestly dont know
<Quilava> hmm..
<y007ghg7> :| i forgot iis the wad folder named WAD or wads?
<DasTier> wad I think
<Quilava> also I think I'm going to bed. I'm tired
<Arcanine> 04do it :/
<y007ghg7> ok
<Quilava> 'night
<Arcanine> 04night
<^Wulfgar^> wad
<Glacymr> 12uh oh

<henkpoley> Using WiiSCU 0.25 (latest) to update Shop Channel and IOS61 should work okay, isn't it?
<henkpoley> hmm "get_nus_object(tmd) returned -1, tmdsize =15" this can't be right

<henkpoley> ah, PEBKAC
<lukegb> PEBKAC?
<henkpoley> Well, in the WiiBrew page about the IOS 4.3 it doesn't mention what the Shop Channel version is now
<henkpoley> also the WiiSCU page doesn't mention that
<henkpoley> So I just picked "v25"
<henkpoley> Which is apperantly not there on the download server
<lukegb> They should all be on the NUSD.
<lukegb> *NUS
<henkpoley> Well it fails to download
<henkpoley> I picked v19
<henkpoley> and that works
<henkpoley> Or which version should I pick ?
<henkpoley> Then I'll update the wiki
<lukegb> Gimme a sec.
<lukegb> Yeah, v19 seems like the latest
<henkpoley> Do they alwaws count down? Or is it pretty randomish ?
<henkpoley> where did you find the 'latest' version btw?
<lukegb> I used NUSD and the "latest" button :P
<lukegb> NUSD r96, but the latest button should be in the released versions.

<Glacymr> 12and you say you are out of it :P
<Articuno> 12Lugia's been helping me get back into it LOL
<Glacymr> 12lol i see
<Glacymr> 12i want to pick drawing up as a hobby
<Glacymr> 12but i hold too much of a perfectionist mindset when i pick up the pencil
<Articuno> 12It's ok, I'm the same, that's why I stopped making art for so long
<Articuno> 12Lugia is trying to teach me that it isn't all about being perfect, he's doing a good job.
<Articuno> 12Too bad he's going home on Tuesday
<Glacymr> 12there is always next time :)
<Articuno> 12Yeh.. next two years or so ¬¬
<Glacymr> 12think about it this way
<Glacymr> 12it only makes seeing him again that much more important if its after a long time
<Articuno> 12True
<Glacymr> 12plus there is still chat and teamspeak (i think)
<Articuno> 12Yeh
<Articuno> 12It's not the same of course
<Glacymr> 12i know you are going to say its not the same
<Articuno> 12I woke up REALLY sad this morning, it's our last full day with him
<Glacymr> 12there you have it lol
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Glacymr> 12anyway i banned a troll last night
<Articuno> 12Nice job!

<mib_zupih> Could you help me? I accidentally have updated my Wii Console from 4.2E to 4.3E version... then HBC had vanished... But then I found out that my update was not succesfull. And now I can't fully update my Wii console. Wii shop is not availiable now. What should I do to fully update my Console or restore HBC. Can I do both of these?

*Shadow_Lugia 6blinks
<Espeon> <%Aurora> the pokebeach staff just called pokemon 13 the worst movie ever <- I'm sadly not even surprised
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Just because one source says it doesn't mean it's law.
<Aurora> 6oh no wonder I didn't see it
<Aurora> 6it's not even in the BW area
*Aurora 6moves
<TimeShift> what, even worse than Jirachi or the Manaphy-movie? oO
<TimeShift> ....wow, that's a performance
<Espeon> well I think it will be average at best but hten again
<Espeon> and lol wut "British Articuno"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yes, I wondered what event made that occur.
<Sparky> 2"Uogull?"
<Aurora> 6If it's worse than the manaphy movie, I'll probably drop dead
<Aurora> 6because that's impresive
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ogle? :P
<Aurora> 6THAT movie sucked

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Lol, ditto.
<Espeon> that makes it even WORSE
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
*Espeon flails
<drfsupercenter> 03Movie 9 wasn't THAT bad
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Except when I have no internet. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03you guys are just the most biased people on the planet
<Sparky> 2it wasn't
<Espeon> but it was still bad
<drfsupercenter> 03worse than me almost
<Espeon> c:
<AeroDracohem> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked it
<Sparky> 2I just don't like how it's ALWAYS movie 9 XD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I don't really mind the movie, actually.
<Espeon> i forgot my "imo" I guess
<Zu-Zu> 0.0
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I don't 'hate' any movie.
<Zu-Zu> !espeon
<Andrew> hi
*Espeon still belongs to ko-kokrazy for 1 more minute
<Aurora> 6you actually liked it, drf?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Zu-Zu> hi hi
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked all the movies
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact
<drfsupercenter> 03movies 10 and 11 sucked more
<Sparky> 2o3o same
<Zu-Zu> !espeon
<Sparky> 2XD
<Aurora> 6it was cool up until the ending, which absolutely ruined it
*Espeon still belongs to ko-kokrazy for 42 more seconds
<drfsupercenter> 03stupid drug induced crap
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Narmy Darkrai, actually.
<Aurora> 6I loved 10 and 11, but the 12th movie made sure of that since they're basically all one big movie
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The Shaymin one's actually the only one I've never seen.
<AeroDracohem> O:
<AeroDracohem> But-but that's the one with Zero in it >:
*AeroDracohem flails
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora, LOL
<TimeShift> you didn't miss anything honestly Shadow_Lugia
<drfsupercenter> 0310 and 11 were the most retarded things ever
<Zu-Zu> timeshift
<drfsupercenter> 03I watched it like "wait, what?... Wait, WHAT? WHAT?"
<TimeShift> that's me
*Zu-Zu attacks timeshift with hugs and kisses
<TimeShift> oO
<TimeShift> whew
<Aurora> 6although I think I liked them because the star legendaries are some of my favorites, and I'm a sucker for seeing them in action
<Aurora> 6I haven't really thought much about the storyline
*Zu-Zu pokes timeshift
<Aurora> 6:/
<AeroDracohem> lol same here, Roara XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I could give a crap about legendaries
<drfsupercenter> 03I want story
<drfsupercenter> 039 had a cool story
<Aurora> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 0310 and 11 were clearly somebody tripping on acid
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't seen 12
<Aurora> 6I gave up on story after the 5th movie tbh
*Zu-Zu sleeps in timeshift's arms
<Aurora> 6 10 and 11 had no story unless you see 12
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I agree with DRF. Story over characters.
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why movie 7 is one of my favorites
<Aurora> 6so do I, but like I said, I've given up on story long time ago :/
<drfsupercenter> 03good story, plus Rayquaza wins
<Aurora> 6 7 was amazing
<Aurora> 6^
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Something other than legendaries appear, attack, Ash saves the world.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Zu-Zu> i know
<Aurora> 6deoxys is a legendary though
<drfsupercenter> 03as is Rayquaza
<Sparky> 2o3o
*drfsupercenter dies
<Zu-Zu> rayquaza is cool
<Aurora> 6but rayquaza wasn't directly attacking everyone
<Sparky> 2XD
<drfsupercenter> 03right
<Aurora> 6he just has no control of whats in his line of fire lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but it still caused lots of destruction
<EpicStatsGuy> :Ð· / :Ð— / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ”: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð„: / :Ñ
<drfsupercenter> 03and was seen as the bad guy
<drfsupercenter> 03which kinda sucks, as Rayquaza FTW
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever XD

<AeroDracohem> asdkfadfsk sorry xAx
<Blackwolf> means they tend to be much smaller

<Sparky> 2... oh yeah
<Zu-Zu> um arti who is SkyTalon
<Sina3> whats the largest wii game right now?
<Sina3> like dual layer wise?
<Articuno> 12To be honest, I bet I could solve this just by saying "Please don't ever talk to me again".
<Blackwolf> super smash bros and metroid collection
<Sparky> 2probably
<Blackwolf> are the only 2 i belive
<Reshiram> 6exactly
<Sina3> wow
<lbiza> oh ok
<Articuno> 12But yeh, it takes a LOT for me to say that to someone.
<lbiza> nintendo puts extra crap on the DVD
<AeroDracohem> O:
<Blackwolf> lots
<lbiza> to make it like a full 4.7gb
<Sparky> 2same
<Blackwolf> a game like super mario galaxy 2 for instance scrubbed is like 1.9 gb
<lbiza> so scrubbed saves space
<TimeShift> still, I'm keeping any other actions on backup. Just for the case everything else fails
<Sina3> what about wii sports?!
<Damos> 13or just send him a package that has a halographic says please don't talk to me
<TimeShift> fine enough for you Roara? :)
<Sina3> its like 0.7 gb...
<Reshiram> 6my god, ban him before bringing up the feds
<Reshiram> 6seriously
<Damos> 13with a face like tis
<Sina3> 4gb of extra shit?
<Sparky> 2XD
<Damos> 13à² _à² 
<Blackwolf> like 125mb lol
<lbiza> but scrubbed is ok then
<TimeShift> banning him will solve the problem on TST, but not the problem itself
<Blackwolf> 140 maybe
<Damos> 13XD
<Blackwolf> right around there
<lbiza> cuz im gettin SMG2 scrubba-dubb-dubbed
<Blackwolf> very tiny
<Damos> 13Ban him from every PokÃ© site
<Blackwolf> scrubbed is fine
<TimeShift> like with your toenail - taking painkillers won't solve the problem. It just calms the pain
<Blackwolf> as long as it was done correctly
<lbiza> scrubba dub dubbed like a rubber ducky in my bathtubb tub
<Blackwolf> :)
<Damos> 13LOOL
<Blackwolf> no, not like that at all
<lbiza> oh ok
<lbiza> lol
<Kyu> 07that's not even a close analogy o3o
<Reshiram> 6i'd assume he'd get the message after being banned from a site and having maniac people attack him for being "autistic"
<Zu-Zu> XD
<Sina3> is the metroid prime collection worth it?

<Stormy> "Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use a wish right now"
<Stormy> Just another annoying song
<Proto> Ah
<Proto> I have weird friends
<Aristeo> But I mean, okay, we got it, every single guy without exception* is arrogant and mean, and every single girl without exception* is evil and plotting to get you and cheating on you (* = exceptions may apply, see comments)

<Proto> Yay partial ancestors
<Stormy> but yeah
<Stormy> that dating site thing reminds me of a quote from a friend in another channel
<Stormy> it was like
<Stormy> "why use interracial dating sites when you could go to <insert name of site> and date dragons?"
<Zu-Zu> look at thi guys
<Zu-Zu> http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UYdtOHNVhBk/default.jpg
<Aristeo> Now that I think of it, I've never seen a dating website that *wasn't* interracial
<Stormy> Well yeah, all races are going to be on dating sites
<Stormy> But mibbit kept coming up with advertisements for sites that were designed specifically to help you find someone who isn't your race
<Aristeo> ohhhhhh

<rosch> that's fine
<Brahhm> and nothing else comes on
<rosch> do you have an sd card inside
<Muzer> Brahhm: you need some apps on your SD card
<Muzer> !hbb
<rosch> is there an sd card inside your wii
<IOS61> Homebrew Browser: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser
<Damos> 13LOL
<rosch> are there programs in /apps/
<lukegb> Brahhm: SD card + apps :P
<Brahhm> yes, is it supposed to be Fat or what
<Muzer> ^^ if you have an internet connection, that is a good app to get
<rosch> yeah fat is fine
<lukegb> Muzer: WOW SOMEONE REMEMBERS THAT COMMAND :O
<rosch> now do you have c rap in /apps/
<Dykam> The default windows install doesn't come with all games installed either :3

<Dykam> lukegb, I do~
<Brahhm> oh lol <--- newb..
<Brahhm> i didn't know that i was supposed to have apz in the card to launch the homebrew channel, someone helped us with this wii so i wasn't sure what to do, but i am a quick learner
<Dykam> you launched the homebrew chan, and it lists the apps ;)
<Dykam> but as you have non yet
<Brahhm> well yea but is there supposed to be some program or something one the card to help it work tho?
<rosch> nope

<lukegb> ohai oldtopman
<tpw_rules> ohai
<Muzer> lol
<lukegb> I swear I've seen you before OH YEAH THE DEV CHANNEL 5 SECONDS AGO :O
<oldtopman> Can my friend use the smash stack on his 4.3 wii to install the hbc
<Damos> 13drfie
<Damos> 13there
<Muzer> to run homebrew? Yes. To install the HBC? Not easily.
<oldtopman> How hard?
<Muzer> Quite a few risky and possibly illegal instructions to follow - it involves installing hacked IOSes and downgrading others.
<oldtopman> ...
<oldtopman> That means really difficult
<Muzer> pretty much.
<lukegb> oldtopman: just hang tight. A new version of the HackMii Installer's coming soon.
<rosch> well it's doable
<Muzer> what lukegb said ^^
<rosch> you just gotta take a risk
<rosch> i should go try it
<oldtopman> What's the worst case scenario?
<rosch> you ahve a brick
<rosch> a nice shiny brick
<lukegb> You brick your Wii.
<lukegb> Mm, brick.
<rosch> bricks have been shat
<Muzer> I'm pretty positive there IS a way of doing it legally, but most, if not all, of the tutorials on the internet host and encourage you to download files that are Nintendo's property. And of course, making it legal still won't make it safe.
<rosch> the chances of you bricking your wii depends on how well you follow your instructions
<rosch> well installing nusd stuff if it's unmodified
<rosch> not really illegal
<oldtopman> I eagerly await a new hbc installer
<rosch> seeing as how you're not in anyway modifying it
<rosch> it's been signed by ninty themselves
<Muzer> rosch: ...what?
<Muzer> I'm uploading a load of commerical games. I haven't modified them, so that makes it legal!
<Muzer> lol
<Muzer> :P
<oldtopman> Downgrade?
<rosch> lol
<rosch> not games
<rosch> IOS
<Muzer> no difference
<rosch> oh uploading them
<rosch> no no not hosting them
<Muzer> just because they aren't selling them doesn't mean you have any more rights to host them
<rosch> downloading them is a different thing
<Muzer> yeah, exactly
<rosch> why nintendo would make nusd a passive d/l server is beyond me
<oldtopman> can you downgrade?
<Muzer> downloading from NUS is fine
<Muzer> oldtopman: Again, not easily - the method I described above IS basically a partial downgrade
<rosch> oldtopman
<rosch> you can get IOS41 from nusd
<rosch> and isntall that
<Muzer> it's best just to wait until the new hackmii installer is out
<rosch> and from there
<rosch> you can get IOS15 downgarded and then get a working IOS36
<rosch> but it all involves risk
<oldtopman> Thanks then. I can wait.
<rosch> you eff up you have a brick
<rosch> but i'm a risk taker
<rosch> i'd do it anyway
<rosch> i can afford another $$$ for a wii
<lukegb> rosch: well, actually, that's unlikely to brick. That's about as likely as installing the HBC to brick, IMHO.
<oldtopman> Will you $hare
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just drf
<drfsupercenter> 03no y, no ie
<drfsupercenter> 03no firefox either
*drfsupercenter runs
<rosch> i guess i should try doign it myself
<rosch> i can probably do it on nand emulated stuff
<Muzer> lukegb: Sure, if you do it 100% correctly it's unlikely to brick
<Lugianite> 2lol
<rosch> hell from what i've learned
<rosch> the only IOS you'll need
<rosch> is systemmenu + systemmenu IOS
<Muzer> but if you don't know exactly what you're doing, it's quite possible to mess SOMETHING up
<rosch> and your wii will still bootfine
<Lugianite> 2hi drf
<Muzer> even if you don't brick, you could still end up with a Wii that won't play some games
<Muzer> or doesn't support SDHC
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<rosch> lol of course
<rosch> but that's why i < 3 dop-mii
<rosch> handles all that crap for me
<rosch> bah nobody's selling a wavebird
<tpw_rules> i can sell you a wavebird
<rosch> i mean for cheap, locally
<tpw_rules> one catch: i think i lost the reciever
<tpw_rules> receiver*
<rosch> 0,0
<Muzer> lol
<tpw_rules> but you can still have it

<tpw_rules> ?
<Brahhm> well the HBB finally loaded the second time, and not bad, alot of nice things to check out
<tpw_rules> yes
<tpw_rules> although, as you've experinced, it's prone to crashing
<Brahhm> yah unfortunatly
<Brahhm> but it does help
<Brahhm> if you can put up with a crash here and there
<Proto> Good
<Proto> welcome back, Andres
<tpw_rules> yeah
<oldtopman> When I start up the homebrew browser, It starts in textmode and gets a dsi error after 2-3min.
<oldtopman> Once i reboot, I t works fine
<tpw_rules> what's it doing?
<Brahhm> me too had the same problem
<oldtopman> Downloading something, either pics or something else
<spudnutz> GC2-D4 moddable?
<tpw_rules> oh
<tpw_rules> skip it and it should work
<mastag22> no
<Andres> Thank you.
<mastag22> replace the drive
*Andres did not get much sleeps at night D:
<spudnutz> thx
<oldtopman> There is a message telling me its probably better to not skip it
<tpw_rules> but if you can't launch it, you should
<Dykam> do it
<Dykam> can take a while~
<Andres> Due to going to sleep a little past 5 am and waking up at about 9 am to help clean the place up.
*Andres was at a parteh >:3
<Dykam> it are the icons of the apps
<Andres> I hads vodkas, beers and tequilas :o
<oldtopman> I'm sorry but you misunderstand me.
<Athenon> hbb problems cannot be solved except by the creator as far as i know, unless you have c knowledge enough to fix it yourself ;P
<tpw_rules> is it even open source?
<oldtopman> The dsi error only happens the first time i boot it evar.
<tpw_rules> ho
<tpw_rules> oh
<Andres> And was spending a lot of the time smoking a hookah D:
<oldtopman> lu
<oldtopman> gia
<Proto> D:
<Athenon> tpw_rules: oh that is true...i kinda figured pretty much all homebrew was open source xP
<Andres> No hangover though, which is always excellent~!
<Damos> 13hey MIchy
<Damos> 13i*
<tpw_rules> Athenon: sadly, no :/
<tpw_rules> hbc isn't :P
<Athenon> tpw_rules: ahh, that sucks
<Proto> Anyone watching the final match
<tpw_rules> they did it so that nintendo can't find out their exploits
<Andres> Football is teh boring :o
<Proto> ...
<Proto> Anyways
<Proto> There should have been a red card against one of the netherlands players
<Andres> Which is why I got to spend so much time on teh hookah yesterday, because the other guys went to watch football and no one else had arrived yet D:
<Athenon> the true exploits are smashstack/bannerbomb/etc arent they?
<tpw_rules> those two
<tpw_rules> too*
<Proto> he kicked a player from spain in the chest
<tpw_rules> but they can also patch the holes hbc uses to install itself
<tpw_rules> an exploit is useless without the hbc installer and vice-evrsa
<tpw_rules> versa*
<Athenon> ja

<tpw_rules> de

*Austin wonders what he missed

<Shadow_Lugia> 6No wonder.
<Sparky||iScrib> 2o3o
<Sparky||iScrib> 2lol
<Athenon> i think they shouldnt publish the details of how any of the exploits work
<Athenon> just put bundle them with the hackmii installer and be done with it, that way nintendo cant fix ANY of them
<tpw_rules> well they can reverse-enigneer it
<tpw_rules> but it takes more time if you don't have the source
<Athenon> right, but its harder if you dont have any details ;P

<wiiman> can some one in here help me for a minute please and thank you?
<arcadekid> speak
<wiiman> I have some game file I DL and some of them extract to iso files and I can add them to my hard drive
<Icey> !Sneas
*Work now belongs to Icey for 10 minutes
<wiiman> some of them come out as gamename.wad
<Chimera> 10 mins of work
<wiiman> I need to know how to add them to the HD
<Chimera> Not too good
*Chimera runs
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7CHIMY
<Quanyails> 7Hai.
<Chimera> o3o
<arcadekid> those WAD games are virtual console or wiiware games
<Chimera> QUANY
<Chimera> Hullo
<arcadekid> adding them to HDD is rather complicated
<wiiman> I think they are VC games files and some are wiiware files
<Icey> :o
<arcadekid> you must install them to Wii's internal memory
<arcadekid> use WAD Manager to install them
<wiiman> then some wbfs files and the only ones that will add with wbfs manager is the iso or a rar file
<wiiman> I need to know how to add the others
<arcadekid> just told you
<wiiman> ok thanks a lot my friend
<arcadekid> WAD apps install with WAD Manager
<wiiman> have a good day
<arcadekid> you select IOS 249 , NAND emulator : Disable, Source : SD
<wiiman> ok thanks a million
<arcadekid> be careful ..not all WAD's are good for your Wii
<arcadekid> if your source is not trusted those WAD's could brick your console

<Quilava> its not on there.
<Quilava> and Tiel, I have been
<Tiel> o.o odd.
<Quilava> but aparantely what I have is so outdated they don't have support for it any more
<Sneas> 03Would that be a GeForce 6 series?
<Tiel> I'm confused
<Sneas> 03wait
<Quilava> I don't know, I tried looking
<Quilava> couldn't find anything
<Tiel> the GeForce and nForce are two different things

<Misty> 13okay Nicke

<Andres> Unless you just lost it!
<spain> i won
<Misty> 13XD
<spain> 1-0
<Andres> You would have lost this one other game though :o
<Quilava> oh. well.
<Quilava> my driver is about 70 versions behind
<Quilava> that might explain it
<Aristeo> :o
<`SLAMMER`> so I get message you not loading stub ios
<`SLAMMER`> any idea howto remove stubs on 4.3u
*Lambda arrests RedDragonX
<spain> no we palyed hard
<spain> played*
<Aicebo> lol
<Lambda> Not today, you're not!
<Andres> Spain has no idea what I am talking about!
<Tiel> ouch D:
<Lambda> I'm takin' you in!
<Tiel> and I don't xD;
<Tiel> I'm just making guesses
<spain> I dont
*Tiel is in the middle of other things and has no idea what you guys have and haven't tried yet
<spain> u talk about soccer?
*RedDragonX puts my hands up
<Andres> No, I am talking about the game.
*Lambda keeps his revolver trained on RedDragonX
<Andres> Never mind.
<Tiel> and to tell how good the card is? XD See how far you can push it by running 3D games until it crashes
<Tiel> that's all I can think of
<RedDragonX> ........[censored]........
*Lambda slowly walks closer
<Quilava> it has to run them PROPERLY
<Tiel> I'm gonna guess that since it's old, it's not going to work very well
*Curly perches on Stryker's head :(
*Lambda handcuffs RedDragonX and throws him into the police car
<Arcanine> 04what version do you have Quilava?
<Quilava> I don't know...
<spain> aah
<RedDragonX> :(
*Stryker pets the... pet Curly.
<Tiel> Well if it can't run them at all, then I guess that's how good it is ovo
<Quilava> it says here 187 or something..
*Lambda transforms into a judge
<spain> so now iam happy
<Arcanine> 04http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-64bit-257.21-whql-driver.html
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Quilava> but this site is showing it in x.xx.xx.xx format
<RedDragonX> :(
<Arcanine> 04this is worth a try
<spain> the new world champ and euro too
*Proto grumbles
<Andres> Spain is Strykah? D:
<Stryker> o.o
*Lambda sentences RedDragonX to 4 years of watching courtroom TV show reruns
<Stryker> I do not like Spain.
<Quilava> trying.
<RedDragonX> as long as it's Judge Judy I might be ok
<Lambda> It's actually... Divorce Court!
<Lambda> Mwahahaha!
<Arcanine> 04it lists your driver in the supported hardware
<Andres> Because it decided to pet someawesomeling perching in your hair? :o
<Aristeo> :o
<Andres> Hi, Awesomeling!
<Lambda> Actually, no
<Lambda> that one can be amusing
<Quilava> where >.>
*Andres sits on Curly's head! :3
<Lambda> it's... Judge Joe Brown!
<Arcanine> 04click the supported products tab
<Arcanine> 04its under GeForce 6 series:
*Stryker sits on Aristeo's head.
*Aristeo pets Stryker :)
<Eris> if your looking for 64bit win7 nvidia geforce 6 series drivers try beta/unofficial ones
<Eris> heh
<Stitch> Aristeo: You dealt me a critical strike D:
<Eris> although if you use the wrong drivers, it'll bug out alot
<Eris> :x
<Aristeo> :o
<Andres> It is an Andres on the head of the Curly on the head of a Strykah on the head of an Aristeo?
<Stryker> Yes!
<Andres> Excellent.
<Quilava> GeForce 8800 or equivalent video card <-reccomended for LoL.
<Quilava> mine's geforce 6150 >.>
<Curly> an epic-totem pole?
<Eris> ah
*Proto blinks
<Eris> i have a pc with a geforce 6200
<Stryker> Very much so.
<Arcanine> 3Video: Generic PnP Monitor on NVIDIA GeForce GTS 360M (1366x768x32bpp 60Hz)
<Quilava> I can't tell what is good. I don't know what numbers to look for
*Andres spreads his arms for the epicness
<Animals> `SLAMMER`: from what i hear you are best off downgrading to 4.1 at the moment...type ? downgrade
*Proto takes a pictur
<Proto> e
<Proto> ednfjsdbjfkbwt
<Eris> high numbers, with high numbers on VRAM, and processing power
<Eris> basically
<Arcanine> 04just
<Arcanine> 04try the update that i linked you to
<Arcanine> 04and see what happens
<Quilava> I did
<Quilava> its asking me to restart now, so brb
<Arcanine> 04kk
*Andres waves his arms, flying the totem pole to the top of the hill of delicious.
<Aicebo> when I skimmed that I thought it said Judge Bon Jovi
<Lambda> XD
<Aicebo> then I read it a second time and was like oh.
<Lambda> The judge of... Soft Rock and Roll!! *awesome guitar solo*
<Aicebo> XD
<Quilava> now I have to try to figure out if it worked or not
<Lambda> I find this band GUILTY of Rockin' and rollin'!
*Lambda could have some fun with this joke
<Lambda> Judge Bon Jovi XD
<Lambda> you just made my day Aicebo
<Lambda> :D
<Lambda> Hey
<Stormy> hi
<Proto> wb Stormy
*Stormy kicked ass at parallel parking
<Lambda> :D
*Lambda high fives!
<Stormy> :D
<Stormy> thanks
<Proto> most welcome
<viince> what forwarder does that link have in it, |Shadow| ?
<Aicebo> glad to have made someone's day
<Aicebo> :D
<Quilava> okay, that made it worse
<Quilava> now it also displays too far to the left
<Aicebo> /late reply
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Quilava> I can't see like the left sixth of the screen now.
<Arcanine> 04interesting
<viince> I guess you don't know which one is included...
<Quilava> I should just switch the cards from my computers..
<Quilava> if I knew how <.<
<Lambda> Judge Bon Jovi convicts Stormy of... being totally rad, dude!
<Stormy> who is that?
<Lambda> I think he used to be one of the rolling stones
<Stormy> *waits to be killed for not knowing about some famous person*
<Arcanine> 04surely there has to be a business around that will do that for yo
<Arcanine> 04u
<Lambda> now he's just some old rock star from the 80s
<Quilava> I don't want to pay money for it >.>
<Lambda> Wanted Dead or Alive was by him
<Stormy> never heard it, so that doesn't help much
<Lambda> and some other song they used to play constantly on the radio
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> but I forget what it was
<Aristeo> How come the military bad guys in movies are always colonels?
<Proto> colonel klink!
<Proto> It sounds imposing?
<Andres> Because all colonels are evil!
<Proto> It's better than read admiral
<Andres> Even Jack O'Neill!
<Arcanine> 04hold on
<Proto> then everyone would just be making jokes
<Lambda> Ah here we go
<Lambda> it's called It's My Life
<|Shadow|> i do know
<Lambda> they played it on the bus a lot when I was in grtade school
<|Shadow|> i packed it myself
<Andres> Your rear is a fleet!
<Stormy> I don't think I know it
*Proto throws dice at Andres
<Lambda> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_My_Life_(Bon_Jovi_song)
<|Shadow|> DCFG it has
<Lambda> click the sample button
<Stormy> my computer has been really slow lately
<Andres> D:
<Proto> wait I need those!
*Proto jumps after them
<Lambda> stupid netbook
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> jk, I'm sorry Stormy's netbook
<Stormy> Oh, that song
*Andres dodges the dice and the Proto
<`SLAMMER`> ?downgrade
<`SLAMMER`> ? downgrade
<Stormy> all the more reason for the upgrade
<Lambda> "As a Democrat, Bon Jovi toured extensively on behalf of Presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, appearing at and playing acoustic sets (with Sambora) at rallies for the Kerry-Edwards ticket throughout the United States."
<Lambda> oh look, he's a li9beral
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> how nice
<Aicebo> I don't think Bon Jovi was in rolling stones
<Lambda> nah he wasn't, I just looked him up
<Aicebo> I think he was just called bon jovi and he was one of those 80's glam bands
<Arcanine> 04not fully sure
<Lambda> he seems old enough though
<Aicebo> and now he's some old fat country [censored]
<Lambda> lol
<Aicebo> :P
<`SLAMMER`> now I have followed that guide exactly to the T hwoever when it gets to step 2 select ios 250 222 223 ect it fails every time
<Stormy> what's a li9beral?
<Stormy> linineberal
<Lambda> a liberal x9
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> ...scary
<`SLAMMER`> not loading stub ios
<Aicebo> lol
<Lambda> actually it's a typo
<`SLAMMER`> is the error I get
*Stormy stays away from him
<Lambda> a liberal x9 is called a "Josef Stalin"
<Stormy> XD
<User-X> anyone have a problem with wii motion plus instructional videos not playing?
<Arcanine> 04why did you get a new computer in the first place?
<Lambda> sometimes refered to as a "Fidel Castro" on occasion
<Quilava> because my processor was 1.6Ghz and ram was 1GB
<Quilava> which is terrible.
<Lambda> but more commonly known as a "commie pig"
<Quilava> plus it had vista
<Quilava> so simply having the computer on ate up half the memory
<Arcanine> 04there are ways to turn off the eye candy
<Arcanine> 04that vista has
<Quilava> I did
<Quilava> it still ate a lot
<Quilava> just a little bit less
<Tiel> yeah :/
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Quilava> dropped from like 60% to 50% usage
<Tiel> Vista even without the addons that you can disable is a memory hog
<Tiel> it's very poorly coded
<Lambda> blarg
<Lambda> now I have that song stuck in my head
<Arcanine> 04ib guess if you want you can try to switch video cards
<Arcanine> 04but i really suggest you find somehow who is capable of doing it for free
<Stormy> it's better than the song I had stuck in my head before
<Arcanine> 04*someone
<Lambda> oh no
<Lambda> what wads that?
<Lambda> Ugh, *was
<Arcanine> 04its not really an operation you can just... phone in
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7PeePWNpQY
<Stormy> The song in that review
<Quilava> I could look it up online and see how complicated it is.
<Blackwolf> User-X use a launcher with alt dol support
<Lambda> No... if I see a video it will infest me as well
<Lambda> D:
<Blackwolf> have it start player.dol
<Lambda> :P
<Blackwolf> should start
<Lambda> jk, I'll watch
<Quilava> if its as simple as adding/removing RAM I can do it myself
<Lambda> it says "peep" in the link\
<Blackwolf> watch the motion plus vid and you should be good to go after that
<Lambda> like the noise a chick makes
<Arcanine> 04by all means try
<Arcanine> 04what is the graphics card on your old computer anyway
<Stormy> that song has some of the most ridiculous lyrics ever
<Lambda> oh... I absolutely HATE that song
<Lambda> D:
<Stormy> oh, we're going now
<Lambda> aww
<Lambda> byes
<Stormy> bye
<Quilava> never new.
<Quilava> *knew
<GhaleonX> success!
<Quilava> I'd have to actually hook it back up and check
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Quilava> but it ran LoL properly
<Quilava> so it's probably better than this one
<GhaleonX> system updated to 4.1, and loads dvdr games through the disc channel
<GhaleonX> huzzah!
<GhaleonX> when I run the homebrew channel, should I still say 'no' to the update?
<Aicebo> bye :C
*Aicebo just downloaded a tooooon of placebo shiiiiit that for some reason she never had and does not know what to start with
<Arcanine> 04got to be curious though
<Lambda> oh shiiiieeeeeeet
<Lambda> muffin
*Curly pokes her coke
<Curly> I think it's frozen solid >.>
<Proto> :D
*Nick turns into a l4d2 charger and charges Misty off a skyscraper *random*
*Curly forgot it in the freezer when she left
<Proto> D:
<Quilava> I'll check before I change them, if its possible for me to do
<Aristeo> For example, in Avatar, in A Few Good Men
<Aristeo> Ummm
*Aristeo thinks
<Curly> The Hurt Locker?
<Arcanine> 04hmm
*Curly doesn't know if that was a colonel though
<Aristeo> Inglorious Basterds
<Arcanine> 04i think it'd be the best benefit to check
<Curly> do the Germans even have a rank called colonel?
<Andres> Inglourious Basterds*
<Quilava> its as easy as changing RAM.
<Quilava> but I don't have an anti-static wristband.
<Aristeo> Andras dun leik mispellings
<Aristeo> :o
<Andres> RAWR, ANDRES*!
<Quilava> Step 5: Removing the old card
<Quilava> Locate the old card on the motherboard and remove it by firmly lifting it out of the slot it occupies.
<Andres> Silly OriStone
<viince> yes
*Nick turns into a l4d2 charger and charges Sparky off a skyscraper *random*
<viince> say no
<Aristeo> The latest Star Trak movie
<Sparky> 2o-o
<Quilava> simple enough
<Aristeo> He was a Captein, but that's close :)
<Lambda> not in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly
<Proto> CAPTAIN*
<Lambda> I beleive the evil soldier was a major in that one
<Aristeo> oh
<Lambda> Also, Captain isn't all that close to Colonel
<Katie|ONLINEGAMING> 5Wut
<Aristeo> ...
<Lambda> or at least I don't think so
<Aristeo> Naval Captain == O-6
<Lambda> oh naval
<Lambda> nevermind
<Aristeo> Army / Marines Colonel == O-6
*Misty 13saves Sparky
<Quilava> I'm gonna see if unreal tournament plays properly with this card..
<Lambda> ah, I thought you meant Army/Marines Captain
<Lambda> whic is like O-3
<Lambda> I think
*Aristeo nods
<Aristeo> So, if you're a Naval Captain, that counts towards what I'm talking about
<Sneas> 03Yay :3
<Skylands> 10Hi :3
*Nick fails, misses and charges to his death as is always the case as playing as the charger on l4d2 online
<GhaleonX> k, thanx
<Aristeo> Curly: The bad guy in The Hurt Locker was enlisted
<Sneas> 03Hi :3
<Skylands> 10!sneas !arcanine
*Sneas now belongs to Skylands for 3 minutes
*Arcanine now belongs to Skylands for 13 minutes
<GhaleonX> anyone tried yabuse?
<Aristeo> If I'm thinking about the right movie
<Nick> greatest fail special infected moments ever, you try to charge a survivor off the building on the first map on dead centre, miss, and fall to your doom
*Aristeo thinks he was a Staff Sergeant
<Curly> he wasn't /really/ the bad guy
<Curly> there were no real bad guys in that movie
*Aristeo shakes his head
<Misty> 13bye bye
<Curly> but I think he comes closest
<Aristeo> And no real colonels in there either :P
*Proto cuts off Aristeo's hair
<Proto> You're bald now
<Curly> well, I couldn't remember >.>
<Aristeo> I think a colonel popped in to stroke the team leader's ego a little while the other enlisteds facepalmed :3
<Aristeo> And the doctor was a lieutenant colonel :3
*Aristeo didn't get a good look at his rank though
<Nick> anyway misty just wondering if you were new to chat?
<User-X> thanks Blackwolf
*Aristeo isn't sure what the moral of the story is
<Curly> [15:58] <Aristeo> I think a colonel popped in to stroke the team leader's ego a little while the other enlisteds facepalmed :3 <-- that was the same guy that ordered one of the POWs shot :O
<Aristeo> :o
<Curly> anti-war is probably the most obvious one
<Katie|ONLINEGAMING> 5Ok bye bye all
<Quanyails> 7Nick, Misty is Damos, who's been here a while.
<Misty> 13no
<Quilava> dammit the sound sucks too.
*Quilava sighs
<Damos> 13yep and I'm proud of it
<Quanyails> 7Brb.
<Nick> o-0
<Nick> heh sorry Damos
<Aristeo> I guess colonel is the highest ranking field grade officers
<Nick> Im not on chat enough to remember other peoples alternate names anymore
<Aristeo> The admirals and generals just do paperwork and send faxes I guess :P
<Aristeo> In the movies, at least
<Sneas> 03Hi :3
<Andres> Hammond did moar!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But you know that, right? :>
<Aristeo> So, yeah, once you get to O-7, expect to be nothing but an administrative assistant for the rest of your career :P
*Andres is being silly though :o
<Aristeo> If you're in the movies
<Andres> Wait, so it is like <=O-5 - Heroic guy, maybeh? = O-6 - Evil bastard! >=O-7 Officework
*Nick charges Shadow_Lugia off the top of a skyscraper
<Aristeo> Yeah, and then,
<Lambda> Tends to go that way yeah
<Lambda> or lots of times good guy = member of revolutionary army in which rank does not exist
<Shadow_Lugia> 6ovo
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Brb. D:
<Lambda> there's got to be a tvtrope about this
<Lambda> :P
<Aristeo> E-5 to E-8 - Heroic friend of heroic guy E-8 to E-10 - Decoration for the generals E-1 to E-4 - An extra to be used to for epic exploding death scenes
<Lambda> XD
*Damos 13saves Shadow_Lugia
<EpicStatsGuy> Meow
*Aristeo is glad RedDragonX is an E-5 -- he's perfectly safe now :D
<Nick> dont save teh shadow lugia its evil D:
<Lambda> oh, another example of evil colonel
<Lambda> A Few Good Men
*Aristeo already used that one :P
<Lambda> oh
<Lambda> musta missed it
<RedDragonX> o.o
<Aristeo> :3
*Damos 13holds Nick over a cliff
<Aristeo> RedDragonX: We're talking about what people's military rank means in the movies
<Lambda> oh yeah, now I see it
<RedDragonX> oh
<Damos> 13Â¬Â¬ What did you say?
<RedDragonX> or do you mean just Star Trek :P
<Aristeo> Colonels are evil, generals/admirals are administrative assistants
<Nick> I said
<Nick> SHADOW LUGIA IS 4EEEEEVIIIIIL (and so is zororark fyi)
*Damos 13drops Nick
<RedDragonX> No Colonels in the Navy
<Damos> 13bye bye
<Damos> 13 3
<Damos> 13 2
<Damos> 13 1
<Lambda> [17:54] <+Aristeo> Naval Captain == O-6
<Lambda> [17:54] <+Lambda> oh naval
<Lambda> [17:54] <+Lambda> nevermind
<Lambda> [17:54] <+Aristeo> Army / Marines Colonel == O-6
<Damos> 13poof
*Nick somehow lands upright due to landing technuques learned by special forces
<Aristeo> Starship/Naval Captains have a 50%/50% chance at either being the protagonist or antagonist
<Damos> 13hey Absol
<Lambda> In the case of Starship
<Lambda> that's because the villains tend to be aliens
<Lambda> :P
<Curly> there is, Lambda
<Lambda> so the seat of villian is already taken
<Curly> a TV Tropes article I mean
<Lambda> Link?
*Lambda was looking for one
<Nick> kk enough rpingforwardslashgodmodding, did anyone get the Jirachi from the wifi event?
*Curly tries to find it
<Damos> 13I did
<Nick> cos I have two spare if anyone wants to trade
<Damos> 13I got that a long time ago
<Nick> how long? cos we in the UK got it only recently
<Lambda> found "Colonel Badass"
*Aristeo thinks RedDragonX knows what Aristeo is talking about
<Lambda> "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass"
<Damos> 13Guesty
<Aristeo> Especially with the Starship Captain / Admiral thing
<RedDragonX> yeah lol

<Damos> 13yes
<Nick> evil purple text ftw
<tabasco> 06right back at you lol
<Proto> wait ExercisingAristeo
<ExercisingAristeo> bbl
<ExercisingAristeo> :o
<Proto> http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/watch-netherlands-nigel-de-jong-lands-kick-to-chest-of-spains-xabi-alonso/
<Proto> watch that real quick plz
<Proto> no card at all
<Lambda> brb
<Lambda> brb
<Damos> 13Gym leader Roark has a Zoroark
<ExercisingAristeo> :o
<tabasco> 06nu uh
<Damos> 13you don't get it don't you.
<Proto> oh yellow card
<Nick> LOL
<Nick> I forgot about Roark
<ExercisingAristeo> :o
<ExercisingAristeo> It looks like a yellow card from a distance
<Proto> it was
<Proto> I thought he didn't get a card at all
<ExercisingAristeo> I mean, it looks like it should be
<Damos> 13LOL
<Proto> It should be a red card
<ExercisingAristeo> There's three types of fouls in FIFA: careless, reckless, and excessive force
<ExercisingAristeo> Careless == overstepping fair play
<ExercisingAristeo> Reckless == acted with complete disregard to the safety or consequences of the player
<ExercisingAristeo> Excessive force == far exceeding the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring the other player
<ExercisingAristeo> No card for the first, yellow for the second, red for the third
<ExercisingAristeo> Now:
<CwT> anyone here ever have there verizon wireless router swapped, the name and pass for it was admin and password1, but the nwe one doesnt seem to be the sae anyone know what it could be pm please
<ExercisingAristeo> From a distance, it appears that he's going after the ball with the kick, but accidentally gets the player. It's not appearing to exceed that threshold from a distance, it's just "reckless", it's just a sloppy move that disregards safety
<ExercisingAristeo> So, from his perspective, that's a yellow
<EpicStatsGuy> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon Punches!
<ExercisingAristeo> But we have the luxury of high speed cameras, and we know that the player was trying to take him out
<Proto> right
<ExercisingAristeo> Which is serious foul play :3
<ExercisingAristeo> Sooooooo
<Proto> I don't feel very bad about it
<ExercisingAristeo> Referees get a conditional pardon on this one
<ExercisingAristeo> Although, I don't know why the center referee was sooooooooo far away from the play
<Proto> Spain's goaly and two other players took down a netherlands player who had a clear shot at the goal, the player waved his arms and ran after the ref, same guy, gives him a yellow card
<ExercisingAristeo> But the announcer guy is right
<ExercisingAristeo> On closer inspection, there's no attempt to play the ball
<ExercisingAristeo> He lucked out on that one
<Proto> He's just lucky he didn't get kicked in the face
<ExercisingAristeo> Oh wait a minute
<ExercisingAristeo> I take back my pardon
<ExercisingAristeo> The referee was right on top of that one
<Proto> Yeah
<ExercisingAristeo> OH!
<ExercisingAristeo> He had a player in the way
<ExercisingAristeo> Referees don't have x-ray vision
<Proto> Quit doing that >:
<Rare> ...
<ExercisingAristeo> :o
<Damos> 13hey eXAKRy
<ExercisingAristeo> He was like eight yards away though :x
<ExercisingAristeo> Okay, he should've seen that
<|Shadow|> GhaleonX, say yes to the update
<ExercisingAristeo> The only other thing I can think of is he was debating in his mind whether to do red or yellow, and the crowd of players running up to him intimidated him a little
<ExercisingAristeo> So, hmmm
<ExercisingAristeo> Yeah, he reached for the red
<eXAKR> hi
<ExercisingAristeo> So. Final verdict, center referee is guilty
*ExercisingAristeo fluffles Proto
<Choochoo> can someone please tell me what could be the cause of certain games making the screen flicker
<Proto> >:3
<ExercisingAristeo> Proto == correct :D

<Armageddon> Sorry
<Armageddon> I ended up going away for 4 days instead of 3 xD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6What 'haxx'?
<Sneas> 03It's ok :3
<Armageddon> ;3
<Nick> oh you mean like elemental typing?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yeah. Lol. :P
*Sneas wonders where in Australia you -kiied because he thought it was too warm there for snow all year :3
<Sneas> 03s*
*Sneas runs :3
<Nick> ah ok
<Creideiki> The only case I have actually experienced where sheer rate of typing made the better "hacker" was... on a POS system... where the comm controller serviced the first interrupt it recieved. Not a token ring... but first come first serve.
<Armageddon> o.o
<Armageddon> XD
*Nick thought his silver energy was stooper effective against shadow types D:
<Armageddon> Snowy mountains
<Creideiki> And the terminals sent an IRQ each key stroke. :P
<Armageddon> and this retarded computer is annoying
<Sneas> 03lolwtf
<Armageddon> Isn't letting me boot from the CD
<Armageddon> Basically
<Sneas> 03oh
<Sneas> 03F8 at startup
<Armageddon> the Mt Kosciozsko mountain range
<Sneas> 03In BIOS
<Armageddon> however you spell it
<Armageddon> I thought all computers were different?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Aura Sphere is a Fighting type move. Lugias are Psychic/Flying. ovo
<Sneas> 03try o.o
<Creideiki> Ergo... one fast typists and the computer "slows donw" for the people who can't type fast enough. Two fast typists and the slower people have no computer at all. Three or more fast typists... and war has been declared.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But, eh, if shadow deflects that, I'll go along.
<Armageddon> Mine is only F9, F10, F12
<Armageddon> Tried it
<Armageddon> didn't work
<Sneas> 03Try F1
<Armageddon> tried
<Sneas> 03Try various F buttons then :<
<Sneas> 03XD
<Armageddon> Going to try that XD
<SpooKy> F11
<Sneas> 03And Boot options should be there
<SpooKy> F11 works 4me
<ExercisingAristeo> Speaking about refereeing >.>
<Aristeo> So
<Armageddon> Nothing worked
<Aristeo> Apparently, there was a group of teenagers there
<Sneas> 03And odd, I think my BIOS is borked on my main laptop
<Aristeo> At the soccer field :3
<Armageddon> I don't think I have access to my BIOS
<Armageddon> Or it's retarded
<Nick> but liek my aura spheres are different D: theyre all like lightpure and stuffs
<Armageddon> F9 = Boot Device Menu
<Sneas> 03And you have to try as soon asit restarts o.o
<Aristeo> When I walked around the track and was passing them standing there near their car, one of them asked me "Hey, don't you referee here?" and I nodded and walked on
<Nick> at least thats what I plan in my fic sequel
<Sneas> 03Try that
<Armageddon> F10 = ROM Based Setup
*Aristeo didn't have a good feeling at that point
<Armageddon> F12 = Network Service Boot
<Sneas> 03And move CDROM to first o.o
<Armageddon> Tried F9
<Armageddon> oh
<Armageddon> hang on
<Stitch> o.o
<Corevette789> What happened
<Armageddon> Or my CD is screwed up
<Shadow_Lugia> 6All right.
<Corevette789> We are not all hostile
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But how's that fic going?
<Armageddon> Probably that lol
<Proto> I'm slightly hostile
<Aristeo> And then when I walked back around to their point again, that same person said "Remember that time when you red carded me and I made that guy cry?"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6How's the ending going, exactly?
<Proto> depends on my mood
<Armageddon> It makes some pretty strange sounds
<Aristeo> And I was thinking "I should have brought my gun"
<Proto> Why didn't you
<Aristeo> Usually no one is there
<Armageddon> lol Boot Order
*Aristeo brought pepper spray instead though
<Armageddon> Optical Disk Drive, USB CD-ROM
<Stitch> Aristeo has one? o:
<Armageddon> Move USB CD-ROM to first?
<Proto> Yes
*InfamousZed is no longer away : Gone for 11 minutes 32 seconds
*InfamousZed is no longer away : Gone for 11 minutes 32 seconds
<Sneas> 03Is the CD drive USB?
<Aristeo> But I said "I've red carded a lot of people, I don't remember everyone I red carded" and walked on again
<Lambda> wb both of you
<Sneas> 03Or built in?
*Armageddon blinks
<Armageddon> It's inside the computer
<Aristeo> When I was on the opposite side of the track about three-four minutes later, I noticed someone else pulled up next to that guy's car
*Aristeo didn't feel good at all at that point
<Armageddon> I think it's built in
<Sneas> 03Then Optical Disk Drive should be first o.o
<Proto> Why didn't you leave at this point
<InfamousZed> i feel like i have a hangover yet i havent drank anything
<Lambda> hm
<Aristeo> Didn't want to look like I was running away, didn't want to risk them chasing me :P
*Aristeo just followed his routine
<Lambda> if a hangover feels the way I imagine it does I feel that way too
<Aristeo> But I had one hand on the trigger and one hand on my phone :P
<Proto> woo
<Proto> Slow cop response time and pepper spray
<Proto> I'd rather run
*Armageddon tries del
<Nick> badly
<Nick> and wb Sparky
<Sparky> 2ty
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Aristeo> And soooooo, before I made it up there, I went inside the building (which I have keys to as a board member) to pretend I had business in there -- that's a pretty sturdy safe room and I can improvise a lot of fun weapons in there to keep them busy
<Armageddon> nope
<Armageddon> del works on my 7 year old comp
<Arcanine> 04Armageddon what is your knowedge level on computers
<Arcanine> 04hardware wise
<Armageddon> I'm in its BIOS
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Mmm?
<Aristeo> And when I was comfortable that they weren't following me, I jumped in my car and drove off :3
<Sneas> this is <censored> :<
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Why? ovo
<Armageddon> Not good with Hardware lol
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Sparky> 2which reminds me

*Corevette789 always had a 9" knofe
<Corevette789> kinfe*
<Armageddon> hm
<Aristeo> Ehh
<Sneas> 03CD should boot
<Sparky> 2and get used to this whole... rearranging of the desktop x-x
<Aristeo> I think that's illegal
<Armageddon> It should
<Armageddon> but it's not
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Did you at least whittle down your ideas?
<Sneas> Either the CD is <censored> or the CD drive is bad
<Corevette789> Not im Michigan
<Armageddon> CD is <censored> prolly
<Corevette789> the limit is like 11
<Aristeo> oh
<Sparky||Writing> 2... actually I'm going to try piano again first but oh well
<Corevette789> Then they go um...no
<Corevette789> It cant be concealed above that length
<Armageddon> I'll try it on my other comp
<Corevette789> So you can still have a katana, just not hide it
<Aristeo> I'd rather have a gun
<Proto> Same
<Aristeo> Unfortunately, the gun I have isn't easy to run in
<Sneas> 03You burned it? o.o
*Lambda is having trouble imagining an 11 inch knife O.o
<Armageddon> yes

<Shadow_Lugia> 6I pressed the first two.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6She was all right when I pixeled-over her.
<Lyon> 04because I CANNOT make custom sprites of wolves/foxes
<Sparky||Reborn> 2and the reason I did it twice was 'cause the system borks every so often
<Lyon> 04Quan
<Lyon> 04what do you think of the shading on it?
<Sparky||Reborn> 2hey Sheena
<Sparky||Reborn> 2y'know SISTEMA C.A.I.?
<Sparky||Reborn> 2the animation on that

<lbiza> thank god for some rip off country is ready to take my american express!
<max__> korean language is mroe interesting, too
<kingu> And transport tae-kwando?
<Bieber> i love cock meat sandwich
<Perseid> astra gives 20 and that is enough.
<Proto> I'm looking for a new camera, despite not having a job or any money to afford it
<Proto> xD
<lbiza> i hope they rape me and take off with the numbers to my card!!!! lol!!!
<dunedude> I just like giga cause it gives me free newsleecher w/ supersearch
<rosch> i like civ3 better though
<rosch> for some reason
<dunedude> $20/mo
<dunedude> and completion is better than astra
<Bieber> giga gives free newsleecher?
<DarkTruth> :X
<dunedude> si
<Perseid> astra's completion is like 95% at least, though.
<dunedude> I dunno, I had a file that was incomplete on astra, tried it on giga, was just fine
<dunedude> giga seems better for older stuff, in my experience anyways
<kingu> :)
<Perseid> It probably is.
<kingu> http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=&list=&vis=Snorre
<max__> any idea on how a game like that would run on wine?
<kingu> Read some of this
<Perseid> But still not better enough to be worth tht much more $.
<ramo34> how you get it with giganews??
<kingu> http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=asatru&vis=s_e_ynglingesoga
<dunedude> http://www.newsleecher.com/?id=special_gn
<kingu> max__: Freeciv is native
<Perseid> Giganews for 20 connections and no SSL is $25, astra with 20 connections AND SSL is $11.
<dunedude> I essentially have diamond w/o vpn for $20/mo
<kingu> http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=asatru&vis=s_e_hakon_den_gode
<dunedude> it's not bad
<max__> it's like the Genesis in the bible
<Perseid> That was a special, then.
<dunedude> I dunno, I may go back to astra eventually
<dunedude> yup
<Perseid> Diamond is $30.
<Perseid> Normally.
<kingu> Except this is much older
<max__> actually, I think I took a class on this
<max__> Loki would always going around, messing shit up
<ramo34> so to get the deal with newsleecher i need to cancel my account and use something else or get it in somebody else is name
<kingu> He is the trickster god
<max__> and Thor would wake up from a hangover, beat the shit out of him, and then drink and sleep some more
<max__> every story opened and closed like this
<niglet> you guys dont like newshosting?
<Bieber> dune whats vpn
<max__> sounds like a really dysfunctional family
<|Shadow|> ns is bad
<|Shadow|> they delete new releases off ther servers
<niglet> $14 for 30 connections + ssl
<Bieber> ns?
<dunedude> virtual private network
<max__> and everybody's about Ragnarok
<|Shadow|> newshosting deletes new releases off ther servers
<|Shadow|> its happen with SMG2
<|Shadow|> happened*
<niglet> oh
<max__> (thanks for the FreeCiv tip)
<|Shadow|> as soon as they get posted they delete
<Perseid> I wouldn't use that as the deciding factor for which service to pick, because they allhave to honor takedown requests if they get them.
<kingu> He has to do with the death of balder, so in a way they rely on him
<|Shadow|> well aw hasent
<Bieber> what have they taken down
<|Shadow|> so there
<Bieber> besides smg2
<Perseid> |Shadow|: I know. But I think it's just been luck so far.
<|Shadow|> giganews did it too
<Bieber> when will they start cracking down on usenet
<Bieber> do u guys think
<Perseid> Bieber: 6 months ago?
<Bieber> they are any lawsuits?
<Perseid> usenet.com
<SLM-tecra> astranet is good
<dunedude> astraweb
<SLM-tecra> astraweb i mean
<Proto> teh interwebs be against you, LaptopAristeo
<Perseid> usenet.com was stupid, though
<Perseid> They advertized themselves as a warez source.
*Chimera sprawls on the ground
<Lambda> death to interwebs?
<max__> I liked Greek mythology: a lot more raep and incest
<Lambda> pitchforks?
<kingu> Ive gotten to the the introduction of the forced belief of chrisitianity, it destroyed anything great, so i just havent continued reading.

<Drake> 04*late*
<Chimera_> Meow
<Armageddon> thanks
<Theguesst>
<Drake> 04I really hate it how schools give out assignments to do over the holidays
<Drake> 04I have two assignments to do and a reading/writing task to be done
<Drake> 04it's goddamn bullshit
<SheenaFox> 
<Lyon> 04
<Theguesst> Lol
<Arcanine> 04how is that even possible
<Drake> 04?
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst how goes
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> I haven't gotten holiday assignments
<Armageddon> 8D
<Theguesst> All goes well
<Armageddon> Or if I did
<Glacymr> 12i see
<eXAKR> bbl
<Glacymr> 12i have a headache
<Armageddon> I probably wasn't listening
*Armageddon runs
<Armageddon> oh, and Glacymr
<Theguesst> I received my bronzong I ordered
<Armageddon> Is Nightshadow|VNC still connected to the PO server?
<Theguesst> And that's too bad
<Theguesst> :(
<Arcanine> 04no
<Glacymr> 12i have a good feeling
<Glacymr> 12that abomasnow will be good
<Theguesst> How'd you get it?
<Glacymr> 12snow play
<Theguesst> The headache, that is
<Glacymr> 12but i can't think of who else to play abomasnow with
<Drake> 04atm I wish I never told my mum I had assignments
<Armageddon> .-.
<Armageddon> damn
<Armageddon> doesn't matter
<Glacymr> 12if used right
<Glacymr> 12a single belted abomasnow can take out 2 donphans
<Theguesst> Something assistive, maybe
<Glacymr> 12if they are belted or not
<Theguesst> Like nidoqueen
<Glacymr> 12i would play it with bronzong
<Glacymr> 12MD
<Theguesst> And that
<Theguesst> Hmm
<Glacymr> 12actually before nidoqueen existed
<Glacymr> 12that was a deck
<Glacymr> 12but the problem is that nidoqueen rapes that idea
<Theguesst> Heh
<Glacymr> 12i currently play abomasnow with http://pokegym.net/gallery/displayimage.php?imageid=48223
<where> omnomnomnomnom
<Theguesst> I know
<Glacymr> 12because expert belt for 1 grass energy, does 50 and makes you draw 2 cards to make up for the fact that you no longer have claydol
<Glacymr> 12but still, 50 damage drains away fast in nidoqueen's presence
<Theguesst> I really cant think of a viable alternative right now
<Theguesst> Maybe in the morning
<Proto> http://www.randomfunnypicture.com/pictures/741mtv-cribs-squirrel.jpg

<WND-tecra> lets say one wanted to download o lets say all usenet headers and wanted to browse thru them, what app is good?
<Drake> 04it's not named for it being 3D, but rather something to do with the story or something...
<Drake> 04like 3D has a different meaning than 3-Dimensional

<pakigirl> prseid
<pakigirl> im not even..
<pakigirl> on the new persona
<pakigirl> since its the same story as persona 3
<pakigirl> for me its useless since i know the story
<pakigirl> Perseid
<pakigirl> im gonna start a game
<pakigirl> of
<pakigirl> XENOGEARS:)
<Perseid> I read a review on RPGamer. It's really different.
<pakigirl> nah fuck p3
<pakigirl> i finished
<pakigirl> it
<pakigirl> u played xenogears?
<|Shadow|> on ps2?
<pakigirl> no
<pakigirl> psx
<|Shadow|> then get the psp version
<Perseid> In Persona 3 Portable, for the female protagonist, eight of them have been completely redone with new characters, while most of the rest have been significantly altered.
<pakigirl> ...
<pakigirl> change nothing
<Perseid> The developers also took a page from Strange Journey, introducing brand new Skill Cards that allow you to teach any skill to any persona.
<pakigirl> that nyx is the last boss
<pakigirl> oh
<pakigirl> hmmm
<Perseid> Vision Quest mode, which doesn't become available until the game is nearly complete. In this mode, you can refight all the bosses from earlier in the game, their strength increased. Defeating them grants rare skill cards as rewards. There are also a series of five specially designed fights, in which your party, level, and even personas, are specifically restricted.
<pakigirl> interesting
<|Shadow|> see your ignorance isnt helping u
<|Shadow|> pakigirl
<|Shadow|> now go get it
<pakigirl> lo shadow
<pakigirl> Perseid
<pakigirl> u play xenogears on psx?
<Perseid> Yeah. Awesome game.
<pakigirl> of omfg
<Perseid> I'm not sure I'd hve the patience or it now, though.
<pakigirl> this game is HUGE
<Perseid> *for
<pakigirl> ITS REALLY LONG
<Perseid> Unskippable cutscenes with unskippable text.
<pakigirl> LOLLLLLLL
<|Shadow|> thats what she said
<pakigirl> xenogears is 80 hour
<Perseid> First time took me 52 I think.
<pakigirl> perseod u know what i found ackward
<|Shadow|> <pakigirl> ITS REALLY LONG <+|Shadow|> thats what she said
<|Shadow|> LOL
<Perseid> For me P3 with FES is by fae the longest at 94 or so.
<|Shadow|> and pakigirl is a girl LOL
<Perseid> *far
<pakigirl> yeahhh
<WND-tecra> sigh
<pakigirl> xenogears= 108 hour
<WND-tecra> i dont think she is on the same track with u |Shadow|
<|Shadow|> pakigirl, u asked a question in another channel
<|Shadow|> i responded
<WND-tecra> her train left hours ago
<|Shadow|> so waitinf for u
<pakigirl> Perseid

<Curly> or at least... if I did I forgot
<Aristeo> It's the same as y = 2^x :3
*where gives Aristeo a cookie for doing a maths
<Aristeo> y = f(x)
<where> okay
<Soyuz> LOL thats interesting to put it in the books
<where> so you have the original amout of people being 100
<Drake> 04?
<Aristeo> Curly: Basically, y = the rate of time, and x = how many people are saved
<Soyuz> Its a very interesting code in oblivion
<where> then after 3 mins there are 50 people
<Soyuz> thay days
<Curly> I don't think math applies in such a basic way in this kind of situation >.>
<Aristeo> Curly: It doesn't
<where> find the constant of proportionality
<Soyuz> "Green Emperor way where tower touches"
*Curly thinks that equation is oversimplifying and is failing to abstract all the variables and so = fail
<Soyuz> all from the beginning words in the commentaries
*Aristeo just wants to feel like his Calculus learnings have some sort of real life applications to them
<Soyuz> never knew it was that smart XD
<Curly> they do :o
<Curly> just not here ^^
<Aristeo> xD
<Drake> 04lolwut
*Aristeo takes the derivative for the heck of it
<where> GOGO
<Aristeo> If you can't take the derivative of something, it's not worth paying attention to it anyway

<Soyuz> Drake; apart of Oblivion quest
<Soyuz> you can either use your brain
<Drake> 04lol
<Soyuz> or make the AI use its
<Soyuz> :P
<Soyuz> in any case, its a good riddle XD
<Aristeo> And
<Soyuz> since if you noticed in the book, every single word at the beginning of a paragraph in those books has its letter in an incewased, daedric style writting
<Aristeo> f'(x) = 2x^(x-1)
<Soyuz> then again it is daedric cult run by a man whose 400 years old o3o

<where> How'd you do 2^x
<where> uh

<Arcanine> 04i don't even care now, if i win or lose i'm still getting to level 16 after this match >_>
<Soyuz> ...?
<Soyuz> is this a zelda game?
<Drake> 04probably WoW
*Drake hides
<Soyuz> XD
<Fysx> er cat
<Soyuz> or that Guild game :P
<Arcanine> 04no
<Drake> 04Guild Wars?
<Arcanine> 04it's a DotA mimic
<Riku> lol
<Drake> 04Defense of the Ancients?
<Drake> 04from Warcraft 3?
<Drake> 04oh come on

<Fysx> awww
<Fysx> a rat and cat are friends
<Drake> 04I suck at that too
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Arcanine> 04Drake
<Drake> 04but it's still fun
<Arcanine> 04i suck at more stuff than you do
<Arcanine> 04trust me
<Soyuz> then you are united in sucking at that said game whatever it is
<Drake> 04Arcanine
<Drake> 04it doesn't matter
<Drake> 04calm down
<Soyuz> I'm guessing its an RTS o3o
<Drake> 04it's a game
<Soyuz> is it?
<Drake> 04Soyuz
<Drake> 04Warcraft 3 is a strategy game
<Drake> 04like AoE
<Soyuz> then its an RTS
<Drake> 04only based in the WoW world
<Soyuz> Real time strategy
<Drake> 04ah
<Drake> 04only
<Drake> 04in the World Editor
<Soyuz> since you know...FPS
<Soyuz> etc
<Soyuz> etc
<Drake> 04alot of people
<Soyuz> play it?
<Soyuz> ONline? :P
<Drake> 04make maps where you only control a single unit
<Drake> 04then share them online etc
<Drake> 04and it's a change from the RTS that the game was meant for
<Drake> 04to a more WoW gaming style
<Soyuz> hmm...
<Drake> 04level up your unit, get stronger, kill the enemy
<Arcanine> 04i can say the same thing about pokemon to you Drake
<Drake> 04?
*Soyuz is focused on trying to properly install the mod DDD:
<Soyuz> curses, this is difficult
<Drake> 04lol
<Arcanine> 04i remember when you didn't want to play matches
<Arcanine> 04because you couldn't win
<Drake> 04heh
<Drake> 04yeah
<Soyuz> drake; dun laugh D:
<Drake> 04back when I was a whining sod
<Soyuz> its hard to properly bring this into creation XD
<Fysx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficwZQYmRLE&feature=related
<Fysx> aww
<Soyuz> since if you do something wrong
<Fysx> duck and a dog are friendly
<Soyuz> Oblivion dies
<Soyuz> textures just go hell
<|lucid|> whats with the gay vids?
<Soyuz> Open cities :O
<Soyuz> good, but hard as hell
<TerrorBite> Is this the open cities mod I've been hearing about?
*TerrorBite is new to Oblivion
<Monger> what gay vids?
<Drake> 04open cities?
<Soyuz> TerrorBite
<Soyuz> yes
<Soyuz> But this is the one with ALLL the open cities and all patches to other mods
<Soyuz> drake; it changes cities
<Fysx> these
<Drake> 04oh
<Fysx> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikm3o5hDks&feature=related - a rat and cat are friends
<Soyuz> wait
<Soyuz> no not open cities
<Fysx> apparently |lucid| hates cuteness :p
<Soyuz> Better cities
<Soyuz> Open cities removes loading screen from cities
<Soyuz> But in any case; Its the hardest mod to download
<Soyuz> it literally tells you if you're computer is too old
<Soyuz> or you're a starter for mods
<Soyuz> it basically says' <censored> you n00b"
<Drake> 04lol
<Soyuz> and you need the OBBM
<Soyuz> TerrorBite; and you're new to oblivion?
<Soyuz> how so?
<TerrorBite> I'm still level 1?
<Drake> 04lol
<TerrorBite> and I don't have any mods installed :o
<Soyuz> you just escaped the prision right>
<Soyuz> *?
<Soyuz> ok, take my advice
<Soyuz> you'll need to go to Elder Scrolls nexus and join their forum
<Soyuz> to get every mod
<Soyuz> or at least be able to download
<Soyuz> Nao
<Soyuz> though for the actual mods
<Soyuz> you need the newest patch for oblivion
<Soyuz> and, before I go on, do you just have oblivion
<Soyuz> or the whole oblivion + knights + SI
<Arcanine> 04wow i'm so depressed i can't even think through this game
<Soyuz> Arcanine; some games you can get
<Soyuz> others you can't
<Soyuz> I'm semi good at RTS, whats the situation?
<Soyuz> TerrorBite; but I say now
<Soyuz> get LTDVampire overhaul
<Soyuz> best. Vampire mod. Ever.
<Soyuz> enough said~
<Arcanine> 04o-o
<Arcanine> 04i have bad luck?
<Soyuz> On the game
<Arcanine> 04i keep getting paired up with bad players
<Soyuz> eh?
<Andres> Histuff.
<Aristeo> hi
<Arcanine> 04it's not only RTS
<Proto> Hi Andres
<Arcanine> 04it's a team game
<Arcanine> 045 vs 5
<Soyuz> Hmm..
<Soyuz> well then best advice I can offer
<Soyuz> use your team mates as bait
<Soyuz> then kill everyone :D
<Drake> 04have you even played DotA Soyuz?
<Drake> 04actually nvm I have to go
<Soyuz> No I havent
*Curly facerolls
<Soyuz> for I'm learning languages |:
<Andres_> Andres!
<Andres_> Let us explode! :D
<Andres_> Okay, yes?
<Andres_> Yay!
<Andres> Bah, why can I not ghost myself? :(
<Andres> Boooring.
*Andres just explodes then.
<where> :O
<Proto> Dang
<Proto> took things and blue with him
<where> Andres used explosion
<where> It's super effective!
<TerrorBite> Soyuz: I think I just have oblivion
<Soyuz> TerrorBite; well some of the mods I have
<Soyuz> you need the SI
<Soyuz> (shivering Isles)
<TerrorBite> and I'm wandering around the city at the moment, been to see whatsisface at the abbey and given him the amulet but haven't gone anything more along the main storyline
<Soyuz> or other things
<Soyuz> wait...
<Soyuz> PC?
<Soyuz> or other?
<TerrorBite> cause apparently the first oblivion gate is a <censored>
<TerrorBite> Yes, PC
<Soyuz> well for starters
<Soyuz> you're level one
<Soyuz> so...
<Soyuz> scamps
<Soyuz> and lesser other beings
<Soyuz> with some Dramora
<Soyuz> so that
<Soyuz> + you
<Soyuz> will; <censored>
<Soyuz> but bad story
<Soyuz> you get stronger
<Soyuz> your enemies do from oblivion
<Soyuz> but I dont blame ya
<Soyuz> work on your skills first
<Soyuz> blade
<Soyuz> blunt
<Soyuz> conjuration
<Soyuz> destruction
<Soyuz> and illusion + sneak and security
<Soyuz> best skills
<Soyuz> and most often used
<Soyuz> illusion as invisibility and night eye
<Soyuz> sneak is Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild
<Soyuz> Security is DB and TG
<Soyuz> and others
<Soyuz> like main quest
<Soyuz> Blade is for every faction
<Soyuz> Blunt, same thing
<Arcanine> 04wow i'm so depressed
<Arcanine> 04my last 10 matches
<Arcanine> 04i've only won twice
<Soyuz> DDDD:
*Soyuz gives Arcanine a cookie
*Drake laughs at the fact that there is a wall of text by Soyuz
<Drake> 04Arcanine
<Arcanine> 04and my last match i was so depressed i couldn't even think correctly
<Drake> 04its a game
<Drake> 04within a game
<Drake> 04it's called insignificant
<Arcanine> 04its not just a game
<Soyuz> its honor and glory?
<Arcanine> 04when i see a game, i see another chance of succeeding at something, out of the many failures in my life
<Drake> 04excuse me but
*Drake /drama
<Arcanine> 04but all that happens with every game i play is i end up failing again
<Soyuz> 'every game'?
<Arcanine> 04every game
<Soyuz> you couldnt have possible lost every game
<Soyuz> like hop scotch or counting
<Arcanine> 04hop scotch and counting aren't games you get recognized for
<Soyuz> and then failures provide how to do better
<Arcanine> 04Soyuz if that were true i would be a millionaire
<Drake> 04oh...ha
<Drake> 04hahaha
<Drake> 04whatever
<Drake> 04you wouldn't be a millionare by learning from your failures
<Soyuz> and i meant that generally Arcanine
<Arcanine> 04i've failed so much
<Soyuz> like for instance
<Arcanine> 04that if i learned from all my failures i would know almost everything in the universe
<Soyuz> if Drake accidently stabbed himself
<Drake> 04You know, I'm tired of this
<Soyuz> or I accidently burnt my hand
<Arcanine> 04which yeah, information is valuable
<Drake> 04I put up with this crap enough with Shiny
*Drake idles
*Soyuz shrugs
<Soyuz> But, then, how does the game work?
<Arcanine> 04Soyuz
<Arcanine> 04if you accidentally did it
<Arcanine> 04what does learning from it prove?
<Soyuz> learning from it that I need to be paranoid and wear protection
<Soyuz> or if I was say 5
<Soyuz> I'd stay away the <censored> near it
<Arcanine> 04solutions aren't always that easy
<Soyuz> No, thats just a small example
<Arcanine> 04in fact solutions are rarely ever that easy
<Soyuz> and I dont think learning failures in wars concern your situation
<Soyuz> but, then how do you lose the game?
<Soyuz> do you just lose all your troops?
<Soyuz> lose the flag? lose the HQ?
<Arcanine> 04lose your HQ would probably be the closest
<Soyuz> Ok
<Soyuz> Is it like you build up your HQ defense?
<Arcanine> 04there is this building that you can't get destroyed or else you lose
<Soyuz> or army?
<Soyuz> ah, I may help then
<Soyuz> I've played some RTS which is kinda like you're playing
<Arcanine> !google league of legends wik
<True_ai> Google search: There are no results.

<Soyuz> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends
<True_ai> Title: League of Legends - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<Soyuz> this?
<Arcanine> 04maybe
<Soyuz> ah..I see your problem
<Soyuz> the problem is that, let me guess, you play your own 'person'
<Soyuz> and have a amount of magic and health
<Soyuz> and different attritubes determining the person in total
<Soyuz> and thus you go to attack or defend
<Soyuz> right?
<Arcanine> 04that made no sense
<Soyuz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV2rRcskn4Y
<True_ai> Video Title: League of Legends - Gameplay Battle Video 1
<Soyuz> is that the game?
<Soyuz> god damnit True_ai
<Arcanine> 04there aren't two league of legends games
<Soyuz> i know what game you're talking about
<Soyuz> though its kinda like BfME
<Soyuz> *BFME 2
<Soyuz> so, why are you losing exactly? (other then building blows up)
<Arcanine> 04i can't answer that
<Arcanine> 04because i can't find a logical explanation other than i have horrible luck
<Arcanine> 04matchmaking randomly assigns you with players around your skill level but it never feels that way
<Soyuz> I really dont believe in luck
<Soyuz> So then, you usually get' suckish people'?
<Arcanine> 04and 90% of the time it always feels like either i get paired up with sucky people
<Arcanine> 04or the people i get paired up against are just god
<Soyuz> Then think out battle plans first?
<Soyuz> or tell the sucky people to take good positions?
<Soyuz> so you can try to assult the other HQ
<Arcanine> 04i'm not that good with tactics
<Soyuz> Then Ask me
<Soyuz> I'm fairly well with RTS
<Arcanine> 04heh
<Arcanine> 04makes no difference
<Arcanine> 04i quit LoL
<Soyuz> Ok
<Soyuz> what about the zelda game?
<Arcanine> 04what about the zelda game?
<Soyuz> hows it going?
<Arcanine> 04which one
<Soyuz> the 2nd one
<Arcanine> 04not descriptive enough
<Arcanine> 04so i'll just say them all
<Arcanine> 04MM i gave up on
<Arcanine> 04TP i haven't touched in awhile
<Soyuz> how about the one with the evil moon?
<Arcanine> 04that is MM
<Soyuz> ah, why give up on it?
<Arcanine> 04there was this one part i couldn't get past

<Arcanine> 04why do you think i was so desperate to finish MGS1
<Soyuz> 02because its a good series?
<Arcanine> 04exactly
<Arcanine> 04if you played one of the later games of a series
<Arcanine> 04wouldn't you be a little curious how the series started out?
<Soyuz> 02I started the 2nd
<Soyuz> 02the played the 3rd
<Arcanine> 04i played 1 when i was a kid
<Soyuz> 02finally finished the 4th after some months it came out
<Arcanine> 04never finished t
<Soyuz> 02did you beat it? :O
<Arcanine> 04it
<Soyuz> 02oh

<^Wulfgar^> CobraX83, game forwarders?
<bb-q> man I wish I could goto a site like engadget and not have to read about 80 different kins of cell phones, there is other technology
<yuyuyup> U R A cellphone
<bb-q> wow go back to joke school
<yuyuyup> dude look
<yuyuyup> don't be jealous of my jokes
<yuyuyup> srzly
<redyey> was a pretty good joke
<Choochoo> will priiloader stop the flickering of some games???
<ial> you sure the flickering isnt from wrong video type? NTSC, PAL, etc?
<Choochoo> it may be...it only does it when I put in certain games
<Choochoo> how do I go about fixing that problem
<^Wulfgar^> you're playing out of region games....that's why they're flickering
<^Wulfgar^> are you using disc or usb?
<Choochoo> disc
<^Wulfgar^> neogamma?
<Choochoo> what's up Wulfgar...how are you?
<^Wulfgar^> are you using neogamma to load your discs?
<Choochoo> yes..R8 actually
<^Wulfgar^> see if you can force the region
<Choochoo> How? I tried everything..it just keeps going back to the regular config
<_DiGiTaL_> Flickering/stutter is due to the speedcap of Softmod DVD-R speed cap
<^Wulfgar^> that's why usb > * ;)
<Choochoo> you lost me Digital
<_DiGiTaL_> Softmodded Wii using DVD-R has a speed cap
<_DiGiTaL_> of like 3x
<yuyuyup> I aint got the money for a god damn external drive
<^Wulfgar^> a softmod reads dvds a LOT slower than hardmod
<_DiGiTaL_> and the modchip is like 6x
<_DiGiTaL_> so if you are softmodded at all you should be using USB HDD
<Choochoo> the crazy thing is...when I have the system at my house, it works fine..as soon as I take it back to the owner, it does that with certain games...the same games that worked at my house flawless on the same system
<_DiGiTaL_> no slowdowns/flickers or jitters during any video scenes
<_DiGiTaL_> Its not flawless if its softmodded using DVD-R
<_DiGiTaL_> put a game with a video intro at the begining like Mario Kart Wii and watch it stutter
<Choochoo> fair enough...but it doesn't do it when it's at my house..only when I take it back to the owner
<_DiGiTaL_> doesnt do that with USB HDD or Chipped
<^Wulfgar^> Choochoo, not possible
<_DiGiTaL_> be back soon
<^Wulfgar^> if it stutters at a certain point, it'll do that no matter where you take it or hook it up
<Choochoo> well, then again..my sytem is hard and softmodded..never though of that
<Choochoo> it flickers when I put in Call of Duty Reflex...bnut not SM Galaxy 2
<yuyuyup> softmod cancells out the hardmod
<yuyuyup> forever
<yuyuyup> until you fucking DIE
<Choochoo> and then the tv goes from ntsc to pal
<^Wulfgar^> softmod doesn't cancel out ALL hardmod...just most of it
<Choochoo> Wulfgar, you still with me
<^Wulfgar^> if you softmod a wii, it WILL stutter during video intensive portions of a game
<Choochoo> so what can stop that? priiloader?
<^Wulfgar^> nothing
<Choochoo> I didn't install priiloader
<^Wulfgar^> usb is the only thing that would help that
<^Wulfgar^> priiloader has nothing to do with stuttering
<Choochoo> I'm gonna eventually do the usb thing for myself...but for others...not a go
<Choochoo> what's the easiest method on doing the usb thing anyway?
<^Wulfgar^> then if they insist on using discs, they WILL have stuttering...nothing you can do about it
<^Wulfgar^> Choochoo, you can find the release thread for CFGLoader here: http://tinyurl.com/wii-cfgloader
<Choochoo> I tried it once and it didn't work for me so I gave up

<DeepSeaLugia> 10It seems as if the first time I come on in months nobody appears to be chatting on here.
<CobraX83> hey Wulfgar ya a forwarder for lets say mario kart wii
<CobraX83> i get only a black screen, any idea why
<CobraX83> anyone know their stuff enough to help please let me know
<^Wulfgar^> you mean like a forwarder for a game you have on usb?
<CobraX83> ya
<^Wulfgar^> those need to be installed to nand
<Airwolve> people usually talk in here?!
<CobraX83> since when
<CobraX83> u mean through a wad for ex?
*eXAKR slaps Airwolve around a bit with a large trout
*Airwolve somehow avoids
<^Wulfgar^> if it's a game you have on usb, and you normally use cfgloader, etc, you can make a wad for it using CRAP...then install that wad and it'll put a channel on your main menu...for launching it w/o having to load cfg
<CobraX83> i installed it, shows up fine, doesnt launch the game only a black screen
<eXAKR> Hax
<CobraX83> ya but what option in crap for the loader to use>?
*^Wulfgar^ is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 10:55a -( P:Off / L:On )-
<CobraX83> so far i tried like 3 myself all same thing
<CobraX83> through crap, any idea what loader to use in it?
<ial> is there any reason i shouldnt force NTSC for all games in config.txt (CFG Loader)? seems like if i force NTSC on US games it works fine, and I need to force NTSC for PAL games. so why not just force all in the config.txt?
<CobraX83> Wulfgar any idea?
<CobraX83> thats the problem i am running into, dont know what loader works
<eXAKR> hmmm

<eXAKR> http://designfabulous.blogspot.com/2010/07/htc-1.html <- Nice ohone concept but
<eXAKR> *phone
<eXAKR> Scroll down and look at the UI mockups
<eXAKR> In particular, the News screen
<zdx> does enyone know if supermario galaxy 2 does have a 4.2 fimrwareupdate?
<^Wulfgar^> doesn't matter... remove the update and usb load it
<zdx> but does it have it or not ?
<^Wulfgar^> why does it matter?
<zdx> just to make an uppdate without internet
<zdx> is it possible to do it from usb stick now ?
<|lucid|> why do you want to update to 4.2?
<zdx> do the 4.2 softmod
<|lucid|> which menu are you on?
<zdx> it doesnt matter... i just fund its much easear to do an 4.2 soft mode update then 4.1, and sometimes i have 4.0 3.4 and all others versions.. and uppdating all of them to 4.1 or 4.2 from internet takes long time
<zdx> so i whant to find a way to update it without internet
<|lucid|> its not easier, its more work
<zdx> its not..
<zdx> i fount it much easyer
<Airwolve> seems less ideal than the current HTC UI
<zdx> but i maybe do use some pl
<zdx> old methid
<zdx> method
<zdx> sorry bad english
<|lucid|> yeah you are on your own on that one
<zdx> what do you mean ?
<Marzuess> so what are the current recommendations for a 4.3u wanting hbc? wait?
<Muzer> yes
<Aaron`> That or go back in time and don't update.
<zdx> ok.. is there onother way to do an update ?
<zdx> like from usb ?
<zdx> let say from 3.4 to 4.1 ?
<Marzuess> yeah, I give my scouts honor that I won't update through nintendo anymore =*(
<eXAKR> Maybe, but look what's on the news screen
<zdx> ? list
<zdx> ? softmod
<^Wulfgar^> updating to 4.2 is just DUMB
<[NiNjA]UK> all depends
<[NiNjA]UK> if u modded for a dumb neighbour/friend
<[NiNjA]UK> then its better to safe update to latest so they dont go fucking it up
<[NiNjA]UK> ppl are dumb ^Wulfgar^ as you well know
<^Wulfgar^> no... priiloader, block updates...job done
<[NiNjA]UK> true
<[NiNjA]UK> but lets work on the assumption that you mod a 3.2 and the game does a check for min 4.1
<J-Lugia> hi Aurora
<[NiNjA]UK> as far as i am aware no games currently do that
<[NiNjA]UK> except MAYBE that rugby game
<[NiNjA]UK> as that is some serious fucked up coding check...
<zdx> ^Wulfgar^ ok, But is there a way to update it from 3.2 to 4.1 without internet but using USB ?
<^Wulfgar^> as I said... updating to 4.2 is dumb... use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide, you'll end up on 4.1...priiloader block updates, job done
<[NiNjA]UK> you could update from 3.1 to 4.2 with safe updater
<^Wulfgar^> zdx, sd, not usb
<^Wulfgar^> you don't use usb to 'hack' a wii
<^Wulfgar^> sd only
<^Wulfgar^> there is a 4.1 safe updater as well :P
<zdx> but safe updater requeires internet don´t it ?
<[NiNjA]UK> your opinion is brash, i;d much rather the dumb neighbour/friend look at system menu and see the latest system menu.... they feel more comftable especially the fucktards that liek to think they know what they are doing but dont have a clue
<zdx> can i download 4.1 systemfiles to SD ?
<[NiNjA]UK> plus. you can buy 4.2 now in stores :(
<|lucid|> no reason to go to 4.2
<[NiNjA]UK> no technical reason no
<elmagico> ive got 4.2
<[NiNjA]UK> purely to insist on it being 'n00b friendlier'
<|lucid|> you could probably use NUSD to download alllll the freaking ios files and the new 4.1 system menu but thats a waste when you can just do it via safe updater
<^Wulfgar^> zdx, all updaters require internet afaik
<[NiNjA]UK> "ewww why you got the old system menu, you do realise 4.3 is out now"- says the technoob
<[NiNjA]UK> "ok lets update it" - says the ubernoob
<[NiNjA]UK> ohh cool
<[NiNjA]UK> my mini is here !!!
<[NiNjA]UK> gtg guys , got a Mini Carbio 2010 edition :p , lorry pulling up now !!!
*[NiNjA]UK gone for the night !
<zdx> |lucid| tel me more about NUSD, where can I read about it...?
<|lucid|> on google
<^Wulfgar^> zdx, why use NUSD when you can use the damn updater?
<zdx> because i dont have wiifii
<zdx> wifii
<^Wulfgar^> wifi*
<zdx> thaks :)
<elmagico> has anyone installed linux on their wii
<^Wulfgar^> you'd have to download ALL the ios's as well as the system menu...will take ages
<elmagico> can i do it from homebrew browser?
<elmagico> i havnt looked
<elmagico> i just installed the browser right now
<^Wulfgar^> elmagico, go look then
<elmagico> oh
<elmagico> opera is there
<zdx> How about using new supermario bros ? I read somewhere that is has 4.1 firmware, is it possible to use that for upating from 3.4 to 4.1 ?
<^Wulfgar^> geezus christ in a handbasket...put the damn disc in and find out for yourself...
<zdx> i dont have it I´m just about to run to the store to buy it, and i dont whnat to waste my money, that why i whant to find out
<^Wulfgar^> never heard of goggle.com, eh?
<zdx> the thins is what i do find diferent information on diferent sites.. dont know what surse is trustable
<^Wulfgar^> for those that are too lazy to google for themselves, yes, NSMBW has 4.2 update on it...now go buy the damn game, update your wii to 4.2 and softmod it
*^Wulfgar^ is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 10:55a -( P:Off / L:On )-

<yuyuyup> I want toribash
<Sina3> for wii?
<Sina3> its out?
<yuyuyup> today
<Sina3> WOAHHHH!!!!
<Sina3> FINALLY
<Sina3> hahaha
<Sina3> look for the wad
<Sina3> it'll be out eventually
<Sina3> damnit
<Sina3> i need 500 more wiipoints
<Sina3> plus system update 4.3
<Sina3> or the updated shop cahnnel
<yuyuyup> you are the worlds biggest failure
<yuyuyup> go to hell where you were born and belong
<redyey> harsh words there
<yuyuyup> just joshing around
<yuyuyup> cause I'm smoking marijuana
<redyey> im waiting for my marijuana
<elmagico> toribash looks incredibly boring
<Sina3> lmao
<^Wulfgar^> go get some meth so you can OD and we don't have to listen to your pointless rabble anymore
<Sina3> i got a question
<redyey> i got an answer
<Sina3> how do people get the wads?
<redyey> lets hope they match
<yuyuyup> meth isn't hep
<Sina3> out of the channels?
<elmagico> you can od on methj?
<elmagico> must take alot
<redyey> usenet maybe, forums, who knows, other people??
<Sina3> like they buy toribash, how do they extract the wad?
<redyey> maybe torrents i don't know
<TimeShift> that's why I keep so many redundant files^^
<Aurora> 6I like being organized :|
<TimeShift> me too
<Aurora> 6I'm flipping out about how unorganized my music files are right now
<Aurora> 6but ugh, that's too many to organize
<TimeShift> but I still have copies of the files I had with my computer about 7 years old or so
<TimeShift> you never know what might happen. And I'm quite happy having at least the most important data saved somewhere if my entire home should burn down
<Aurora> 6this song is so hauntingly beautiful, and I'm still crying :|
<Aurora> 6I don't think I want to see the movie, tbh
<Aurora> 6but then again...I kinda do ._.
<Mark0990> any one got the 4.3 downgrade to work?
<Mark0990> 16 of the 17 wads fail to install
<Mark0990> can anyone help?
<Mark0990> I have had enough of this little white piece of shit
<elmagico> lol
<Alex313> excuse me?
<Aurora> 6and so I watch it
<Alex313> damn racist.
<Blackwolf> why did you upgrade it in the first place then
<Mark0990> following a duff guide on youtube :(
<Blackwolf> and read the guide, the process works fine for downgrading
<Mark0990> followed to the letter
<Blackwolf> some guide told you to upgrade to 4.3?
<CobraX83> Blackwolf do u have any idea about game channle forwarders>
<Mark0990> i am using indy
<Blackwolf> i highly doubt that unless it was a joke
<Blackwolf> what about them CobraX83?
<Mark0990> the guide was for fw 4.3 so I upgraded first. Im new to this and didnt know 4.1 was best
<Blackwolf> lol
<Mark0990> the down grade doesnt work
<Mark0990> not for mine
<Blackwolf> it does work
<Rad0x> that's not a very smart move :)
<CobraX83> umm i cant get any to work, i used to be able to when i had a wbfs drive. NBow i made it fat 32 and cant get it to work tyhey all go to a black screen
<Blackwolf> never tried it with fat32
<Mark0990> I am using Indy. MMM loads and the it says go to load another IOS
<CobraX83> ahh for real, this shit is a bitch
<Blackwolf> do you have correct files Mark0990
<CobraX83> anyone here have a fat32 with game channel forwarderS?
<Mark0990> just downloaded R6
<CobraX83> that work
<Mark0990> this months ver
<Mark0990> step one is to get into MMM. That works
<CobraX83> umm i installed them as wads from gbatemp and even made my own
<Mark0990> step 2 is to install wads
<Mark0990> it says.....
<Mark0990> -Select "Load another IOS" -press A
<Mark0990> done
<CobraX83> if anyone knows please help out
<Mark0990> it then says.....
<Mark0990> -Select ios250, or 222/223 or perhaps or others
<CobraX83> oh and my usb gx wont load shit but cfg loader does, any ideas?
<[Chii]> less than $1.5 :)
<Blackwolf> because usb gx is trash
<Blackwolf> cfg loader much better
<Mark0990> if I select any of these it says "not loading stub IOS"
<CobraX83> i like how it shows the disc spiining etc
<CobraX83> but i have to say cfg runs train on my games, no issues so far
<CobraX83> umm do i need to point out a folder in cfg or some shit to get forwarders to work?
<Mark0990> Blackwolf, any ideas?
<Blackwolf> Mark0990 nope, works for everyone else
<Blackwolf> just make sure you have the proper files
<Blackwolf> proper ios etc
<Mark0990> :( :(
<^Wulfgar^> 4.3 isn't a guarantee softmod/hack...it doesn't work for some people...which is why you shouldn't have upgraded in the first place
<Mark0990> the files all came in the pack o the guide :(
<^Wulfgar^> which is alos why there is no 4.3 guide on the bots
<^Wulfgar^> also*
<^Wulfgar^> ? list
<bb-q> DOH!
<Mark0990> I have that IOS41 v3348. Is it possible to downgrade and IOS?
<^Wulfgar^> eh?
<bb-q> downgrade is bad, mmkay
<CobraX83> guys do any of u use game channle forwarders or no?
<^Wulfgar^> only forwarder I use is for cfgloader
<CobraX83> wulfgar u think its better than forwarders, thats what i have now a cfg lchannel that works
<^Wulfgar^> is it really that much work to just load cfgloader via a forwarder and THEN load the game you wanna play?
<CobraX83> no i guess not just like how they look in their own little boxes
<Alex313> Go to cfgloader and scroll through all your games, better experiance
<CobraX83> ya i hear that, any idea where i can find some good themes for it. Only thig i have seen is a page with like 12 lame ones
<^Wulfgar^> CobraX83, then use CRAP to make your own wads....I find it dumb to take up valuable nand space just cause you wanna see the banner animation
<CobraX83> but Wulfgar u told me that earlier then i asked a q about it and u never answered me
<bb-q> Cobra, forwarders suck up mad memory on wii
<^Wulfgar^> the wads that CRAP creates are only 8mb
<CobraX83> I have used CRAP and dont know which loader to try and build it with , i tried a couple like 1.1 and they didnt work. The latest one i tried for punch out said error -6 or somthing whn i launcg it
<^Wulfgar^> CobraX83, just use the 'return_to_channel
<^Wulfgar^> feature of cfg
<CobraX83> ya only 7 to 8 or so , they take up like 6 blobks and i dont use the nand for anything else atm
<^Wulfgar^> and set priiloader to boot cfg...
<^Wulfgar^> then you'll always be in cfg
<CobraX83> wait one sec let me check that out
<CobraX83> so whats it exactly going to do?
<^Wulfgar^> return_to_channel will let you set cfg so it reloads itself when you press the 'home' button
<CobraX83> oh cool so no need to relaunch?
<^Wulfgar^> return_to_channel = forwarderID
*bb-q waits for impending tornado
<CobraX83> where do i set this at menu where bootmii can be written or dumped etc?
<^Wulfgar^> you set it in the cfg config file
<^Wulfgar^> use the configurator for cfg
<T00lM4N> ? priiloader
<CobraX83> know of a site with a good amount of cfg themes>?
<^Wulfgar^> make your own
<T00lM4N> was there a bot on here which had search options or am i on drugs?
<^Wulfgar^> try ? list
<T00lM4N> ? list
<T00lM4N> thanks
<T00lM4N> looking for a priiloader guide i finally got a router and want to setup the wii for the net but don't want my sister to accdiently update
<^Wulfgar^> www.google.com
<T00lM4N> ? brickblocker
<^Wulfgar^> http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Preloader/Priiloader
<T00lM4N> you work for them?
<T00lM4N> hahaha
<T00lM4N> whats this brickblocker same thign?
<^Wulfgar^> no
<T00lM4N> ? brickblocker
<^Wulfgar^> priiloader is full of hacks...one of which is to block updates
<^Wulfgar^> brickblocker is to remove the updates from games before burning them
<T00lM4N> ooooh ok seeing as how i don't burn games and just use wbfs manager i guess i don't need that
<^Wulfgar^> wbfs ftl
<^Wulfgar^> fat32 > *
<T00lM4N> well ya i found out later that ntsc is supported but oh well
<^Wulfgar^> you mean ntfs
<T00lM4N> hahaha ya my bad
<^Wulfgar^> problem with wbfs is that you can't even scandisk the drive
<^Wulfgar^> or defrag
<DasTier> it's hardly possible to fragment it though
<^Wulfgar^> sure it is...add/remove games...
<^Wulfgar^> now you're fragmented
<DasTier> oh right, in my mind I thought of a world where all isos are same size *coughs*
<DasTier> yes, removing a small iso then adding a large one causes the large one to fragment, you're right
<^Wulfgar^> and the size of .wbfs files varies even more
<mapd> hi
<CobraX83> how do i successfully choose a cheat in cfg?
<CobraX83> i clicked it but when launch the game it says no code found when its about to launch
<T00lM4N> well what would i need to do to use ntfs
<^Wulfgar^> CobraX83, you realize cheaters suck, right? and that you CAN get banned online for using cheats
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, use fat32...nothing is bigger than 4gb for wii
<^Wulfgar^> CobraX83, you need to 'save .gct'
<mapd> updating firmware is possible now?
<T00lM4N> would i still be able to use wbfs manager to load my games or how would i go about doing that?
<^Wulfgar^> mapd, never update beyond 4.1
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager
<CobraX83> Wulfgar just doing it to beat bald bull ( :
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, you can find the latest version of wii backup manager here: http://tinyurl.com/wiibackupmanager
<T00lM4N> thanks ^Wulfgar^ gonna try and tackle this priiloader first, am i going to need my sd card or can i do it by loading it on my hard drive through my fat32 parition?
<^Wulfgar^> sd
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, if you used the softmod guide linked on the bot, you should already have priiloader installed
<T00lM4N> ^Wulfgar^ since it said it was optional at the time i didn't do it, and since i didn't have internet on the wii i didn't see it as something to worry about
<T00lM4N> but now that i'm going to connect it to my router i'm scared the little one will update and fuck it up
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, and what fw are you on now?
<T00lM4N> 4.2u
<T00lM4N> when i bought my wii it came with that on it
<^Wulfgar^> then go back to the 4.2 guide and follow the steps for priiloader
<T00lM4N> ? list
<T00lM4N> ? softmod
<T00lM4N> ahhh doesn't seem that complicated at all
<T00lM4N> the readme scares me the guide is nicer
<mapd> ok thx ^Wulfgar^
<|lucid|> you have bootmii as boot2?
<T00lM4N> |lucid| i THINK i do but i can't remember what was the other option if it couldn't be done with boot2?
<^Wulfgar^> as an ios
<Sina3> what is an NZB file?
<bb-q> New Zealand Bitch file
<^Wulfgar^> Sina3, http://www.slyck.com/Newsgroups_Guide
<Bieber> Nice Zebra Bitch
<Sina3> no!
<Sina3> in terms of wii channels
<|lucid|> if you have it as boot2 and have the bootmii folder on your SD, bootmii will pop up every time you power on the wii
<Sina3> someone gave me a toribash download link
<^Wulfgar^> there is no nzb as a wii channel
<^Wulfgar^> an nzb is for usenet
<Bieber> Nintendo Zebra Bitch
<Sina3> oh sorta like a torrent?
<^Wulfgar^> kinda
<Sina3> i got it from here
<^Wulfgar^> much better than torrent though
<Sina3> but im not sure if i should trust it
<Sina3> http://d6c89a5b.thesefiles.com/
<^Wulfgar^> do you even have usenet access?
<Sina3> no
<Sina3> probably not
<^Wulfgar^> then you can't even use it
<T00lM4N> |lucid| well i don't even use my sd card anymore, i made a fat32 parition on my hd and just have my apps through there
<^Wulfgar^> T00lM4N, I'd make the whole drive fat32
<^Wulfgar^> screw wbfs
<T00lM4N> i might do that later on, if i don' thave bootmii as boot2 is that a big problem for installing priiloader?
<^Wulfgar^> no
<|lucid|> no but you will have a higher degree of confidence messing with the system menu ios
<^Wulfgar^> chances of bricking with priiloader is pretty slim
*^Wulfgar^ is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 02:17p -( P:Off / L:On )-
<T00lM4N> so just do as the guide says? i don't have to do anythig different since i migh tnot be on boot2
<|lucid|> cross your fingers
<T00lM4N> in that case fuck that
<T00lM4N> i rather not install priiloader
<|lucid|> just figure out which release is the most reliable for your system menu
<T00lM4N> only reason i really want to connect my wii to the net is to download covers
<|lucid|> just turn wiiconnect24 off
<|lucid|> you can still download covers
<AeroDrawcohem> Kyuuuuuuuhai~ O:
<T00lM4N> so as long as wiiconnect24 is off i don't have to worry about my sister updating to 4.3?
<|lucid|> in your case, priiloader is the only brick protection you have at the moment
<bb-q> Tool
<bb-q> password protect you net
<T00lM4N> bb-q it is
<bb-q> then dont tell sis password
<bb-q> or if you want, mac filter you net, so that you control what connects to it
<T00lM4N> bb-q but once i set it she wouldn't have to re-enter it
<bb-q> you dont leave the wii setup to connect, just delete when you are done getting covers
<|lucid|> if you have a cios installed, and it gets updated to 4.3, you can downgrade to 4.1 using the korean ios files
<bb-q> takes 2 secs to restup
<bb-q> thats what I do anyways
<T00lM4N> |lucid| what would brick my wii if i'm just loading games trhough wbfs manager + no internet ? nothing right i should be safe?
<|lucid|> a bad wad file install
<T00lM4N> good point bb-q
<yuyuyup> bb-q is like some kind of cell phone
<yuyuyup> seriously
<bb-q> U R FUNNY!
<T00lM4N> thats pretty much it?
<|lucid|> yeah, if you dont run burned games, you should be ok
<bb-q> heh if you could figure out what site/domain nintendos does its update through, you could block that in your router
<T00lM4N> k ya just thats why i didn't want to install priiloader from the beginning
<T00lM4N> i'm just scared i'm gonna fuck it up
<T00lM4N> i'll just do as you suggested, connect24 off and delete my connection after i'm done getting covers
<T00lM4N> i don't give a hoot about playing any games online
*Kyu sits all over Aero's tablet
<jtmoney> hey guys i hadnt updated games to kids wii in a while
<jtmoney> but i addded like 10 today

<|lucid|> http://code.google.com/p/priiloader/
<Sparky> 2it was WEIRD
<SheenaFox> I can tell by the title
<Sparky> 2well actually it was basically "if an apple a day keeps the doctor away, what does half an apple do?"
<Sparky> 2and then the last line was something along the lines of "Let us chase the doctor away~"
<Sparky> 2which was weird
<Damos> so a half apple chases the doctor away because the doctor tried taking a bite from the apple

<Aurora> 6damos, they weren't criminals
<Aurora> 6not at that time
<Damos> 13it was really crazy how that dude jump on the wheel while the plane was taking off
<Aurora> 6no one knew what was ahppening until it happened
<Aurora> 6*happening
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6What story are you talking about?
<Damos> 13but that scene was fake
<Aurora> 6I suddenly think we're talking about two different things
<Articuno> 12Hi :3
<drf|work> Arti, guess what LOL
<drf|work> I ate at a different Panda Express today
<drf|work> where my other receipt said XAI
<drf|work> this one said ALEX
<Damos> 13the scene when the black dud jumps from the car onto the jet
<drf|work> so it must be the cashier's name
<Damos> 13that has to be fake
<Aurora> 6...
<drf|work> meaning LOLOL SOMEONE'S IRL NAME IS XAI
<Aurora> 6are we even talking about 9/11, damos?
<Aurora> 6I don't know what story you're telling
<Damos> 13Flight 93
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6wow then that movie is pretty darn hollywood style
<drf|work> that never happened in the movie
<drf|work> it's not
<drf|work> Damos must be high or something
<Aurora> 6because that's NOTHING compared to thestory
<Aurora> 6*story
<Damos> 13no car can keep the same speed as a large boeing taking off
*Aurora 6just lets him talk
<Damos> 13I'm done
<MrDopeman> is it true that leaving GC.pad or memcards plugged in is baiting a brick?
<Damos> 13I need to get ready in 15 minutes
<Damos> 13to go to town
<Damos> 13soooo
<Damos> 13bbl
<Espeon> 6meow
<|X|nWo|X|> MrDopeman • is it true that leaving GC.pad or memcards plugged in is baiting a brick?
<|X|nWo|X|> doing what?
<|X|nWo|X|> i think i have had a gc memory card in
<|X|nWo|X|> since launch
<|X|nWo|X|> hard mod + soft mod
<|X|nWo|X|> since you could
<|X|nWo|X|> no brick ....
<bstock> yo |X|nWo|X|, kiffa over in #fw needs a /kb ;)
<|X|nWo|X|> some shit says not to have gc mem/stick
<|X|nWo|X|> k
<bstock> what you up to today
<|X|nWo|X|> kafia ?
<bstock> kiffa
<MrDopeman> yea many tuts warn to remove it
<MrDopeman> i just got my wii component cable so now i can sell my gcn
<MrDopeman> just wanted to know if its save to leave them plugged in if all u do is play or install wad games
<bstock> if tuts say to remove.. prob best to remove just to be safe
<MrDopeman> but as long as i just play wii games i can leave it in, or?
<Soljarag> hey, anyone here have their sensor bar above a big flat panel?
<Aurora> 6lol
<Aurora> 6 2.2 days worth of music
<MrDopeman> Soljarag, i tried that but it sucked, put it at bottom now
<Aurora> 6compared to others, it's not much
<Aurora> 6but if you think about it
<MrDopeman> 46"
<Aurora> 6I'd have to sit here for over 2 days to hear all of that
<drf|work> I prolly have about 2 months
<Soljarag> is yours wall mounted?
*drf|work runs
<MrDopeman> yes
<Aurora> 6lol
<drf|work> I just don't use iTunes, wtf is the point of an iTunes library?
<drf|work> I have about a day and a half just in iTunes music LOL
<drf|work> and that's like 5% of my total music
<MrDopeman> about 1m above ground
<Soljarag> how do u have it on the bottom?
<Aurora> 6meh
<MrDopeman> using the sticker pads that came with my wii
<Soljarag> umm... so you taped the top of it?
<bstock> i have it top mounted on my 46", actually i just rest the bar on the actual tv
<Glacymr> 12rawra
<bstock> the plastic stand thingy broke
<bstock> and it works fine
<MrDopeman> mine was not working well when sitting on the floor
<Aurora> 6breeeeee
<bstock> i wouldn't think it'd work well when sitting on the floor
<MrDopeman> Soljarag, u just put the dualsided sticker pads on the bar and tucked it under the sony logo
<bstock> it's supposed to be either directly above or directly below
<MrDopeman> it works fine now
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Soljarag> well.. i have it on top now... but its wayyy off... I'm like pointing 3 feet higher than its showing
<bstock> Soljarag: did you change the setting in the menu
<bstock> to above the tv instead of below
<Soljarag> yep
<bstock> hmm, maybe try turning off the lights? i've noticed certain types of lights can interfere
<MrDopeman> bstock: me sitting on the floor, not the bar
<bstock> ah
<MrDopeman> i sit on a futon to play
<MrDopeman> 5cm above ground
<Soljarag> i dunno... its really odd how much it is off
<MrDopeman> try put it below
<MrDopeman> the sticker pads work well
<Soljarag> and the bar is only 2" from the screen
<Espeon> whe- oh
<Soljarag> yeah.. i may have to rig something.... my screen has a wierd frame
<MrDopeman> philips?
<Soljarag> i have the samsung
<MrDopeman> ah yea the new samsung have weird frames like philips
<MrDopeman> my friend has c650 40" samsung
<MrDopeman> my sony has a nice flat metal edge
<MrDopeman> bstock the plastic stand really is a joke
<MrDopeman> its so flimsy
<bstock> yeah that's why mine just lays on the top of the tv heh
<MrDopeman> Soljarag, not sure if it suits ur needs but u can use candles instead of the bar
<MrDopeman> a girl i know does that
<Soljarag> ha, really?
<MrDopeman> yea
<Soljarag> thats funny
<Kyu> 4SPLIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
<MrDopeman> two candles
<SheenaFox> Orly?
<MrDopeman> the "sensor bar" is just two IR lights
<Soljarag> yeah.. i think tv's should have them built in...
<Espeon> Kyu split script = busted :3c
<MrDopeman> heh
<T00lM4N> hey guys have a noob question not involving wii but whats the difference between x64 and x86 i'm wanting to dl a program but which i should get
<LiThIuMx> x86 isfor 32bit
<LiThIuMx> x64 is 64bit
<MrDopeman> get the one corresponding to ur windows version
<T00lM4N> thanks LiThIuMx
<AeroDrawcohem> ohhey the chat didn't explode :D
<SheenaFox> XD
<Soljarag> well... it worked great when i had my tv on the stand.. and i had it below the tv....
<Soljarag> so ill have to rig something to put it below it./..
<MrDopeman> hot glue it :P
<MrDopeman> actually if the frame is not flimsy plastic that will work well
<Soljarag> ha
<AeroDrawcohem> There we go? oAo
<AeroDrawcohem> minisplit :D
<Aurora> 6and wow, that was ocean that went down
<Aurora> 6mini?
<Aurora> 6that took out all but 4 people
<drf|work> that ONLY took out 4 people
<drf|work> lame people who use Nest
*drf|work h ides
<AeroDrawcohem> O: I was on the other side

<AeroDrawcohem> XD
<Articuno> 12I thought that was Xai coming online v_____v
<Aurora> 6mibbit still can't connet to ocean
*Articuno is REALLY sad now
<drf|work> orly?
<drf|work> I'm using it right now
<Lugia> Sorry...
<Aurora> 6...
*Articuno slaps Lugia
*Lugia hugs the Art burd#
<Articuno> 12LOL!
<Lugia> Xai's computer hate me...
<Aurora> ocean.systemnet.info: Closing Link: [207.192.75.252] (CGI:IRC -- No access)
<Lugia> everytime I sit infront of it it crashes...
<dunedude> meh, it's ok
<drf|work> that's CGI:IRC
<drf|work> not Mibit
<drf|work> *mibbit
<Aurora> but I was using mibbit o-o
<dunedude> that's a rear projection tv, sxrd
<Aurora> 6unless this is something I'm completely blind to....
<Aurora> 6but I did it this way for months
<drf|work> what way
<MrDopeman> yea also looks to sterile to me
<Aurora> 6mibbit, connect to ocean.systemnet.info:6667
<MrDopeman> the whole "altar"
<Aurora> 6up until recently, it worked
<Articuno> 12Lugia is leaving tomorrow v____v
<drf|work> I do ocean.lugia.us
<drf|work> no port number
<Soljarag> ha
<Soljarag> yeah.. replace it with a LED
<bstock> dunedude: not all rear projection is bad, new dlp tv's are rear projection and they're still nice
<Reshiram> *oh yay
<AeroDrawcohem> Reshiraaaam O:
<dunedude> all dlp is rear projection
*Reshiram torch
<dunedude> and they're not that nice
<AeroDrawcohem> XD
<bstock> yeah but it's a far cry from the old 60" rear projection tv's, with like a 6Â° viewing angle
<Glacymr> 12cough
<MrDopeman> led sux for games
<MrDopeman> they lag
<dunedude> but they're no where near as good as a Kuro
<MrDopeman> i tested like 5 up to 4000eu range
<dunedude> if you don't mind settling for a tv, I guess dlp is ok
<bstock> they're also prob 1/5 the price
<Watanuki> CRTs ftw
<dunedude> well, buy all means, save some money then
<MrDopeman> i had a crt-hd until recently
<bstock> i have 2-yr-old lcd and it's fine for me
<Soljarag> a 50
<MrDopeman> nice for non hd consoles
<dunedude> I imagine alot of things are "fine for you"
<MrDopeman> good up to 720p
<bstock> lol so anything other than top of the line is shit? riiight
<Soljarag> a 50" crt would need a metal reinfored stand
<MrDopeman> i had 32" crt-hd it weighed 50kg
<Watanuki> bstock: ONLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE sONY IS GOOD
<Watanuki> oops
<Watanuki> darn caps lock
<Soljarag> anyone use a wireless sensor bar?
<bstock> think you picked up his point of view pretty well
<TMAN_AFK> Soljarag i do
<Soljarag> how long do batterries last?
<dunedude> no, there are good values out there, I just don't find rear projection to be one of them, base on its inherant weaknesses
<bstock> Soljarag: we had some at work, were fine, but annoying to change batteries
<dunedude> I feel panasonic plasma are a great value
<bstock> and have to turn them on all the time
<TMAN_AFK> ya Soljarag the batteries don't last very long
<TMAN_AFK> but just get rechargeable and u are good to go
<dunedude> I think there are only a couple of companies that even make rear projection anymore anyways
<Watanuki> Plasma has a shorter lifespan doesn't it?
<dunedude> no
<bstock> plus with rear projection, have to occasionally buy bulbs as well
<Soljarag> you have a wii at work?? where do u work?
<Watanuki> bestbuy
<bstock> Soljarag: no, we used wiimotes and a sensor bar though for custom application
<Soljarag> ha, ok
<rosch> ???
<bstock> actually in some of the offices though we didn't even need the sensor bar, because the flourescent lights provided enough IR so that from the desk it worked perfectly heh
<Soljarag> wierd
<Kipi> |3
<Dykam> Â¿Â¿Â¿
<Soljarag> well..speaking of work.... I better get back to work

<bor_venin> is that confirmed yuyuyup?
<Watanuki> who is making that?
<Watanuki> acclaim is dead and so is Midway
<yuyuyup> a german ratings board rated nba jam for 360/ps3
<bor_venin> yea i read that rumor few days back
<bor_venin> http://wii.ign.com/objects/056/056365.html Watanuki
<Watanuki> ah EA Sports
<bor_venin> hey question
<Aeroslash> wb llots
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14ty
<Aeroslash> np
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14aaaaaand brb again
<bor_venin> my wii 4.1u is Korean and presoftmodded, it runs USBloader GX, i am new to softmodding and worried about fkin up my box
<bor_venin> so i saw CFG USB loader
<bor_venin> and the menu and coverflow of the GUI looks sick
<bor_venin> basically my question is this, if i install cfg usb loader, is there a chance i can brick my wii?
<sexual> rofl no
<sexual> you dont "install it" like you think you do... you just put it in the apps folder
<Evil0ne> lol
<Evil0ne> yea
<bor_venin> oh ha
<Evil0ne> all u "install" is a forwarder
<bor_venin> so installing homebrew like that or a channel, doesnt modify anything to the wii's OS that can brick it?
<Evil0ne> nope
<bor_venin> cool
<sexual> there are bannerbricks if you install wads from weird sources
<bor_venin> yeah im just gonna go by wiihacks or gbatemp sources
<bor_venin> does cgf usb loader have an option to download covers like usbloader gx has?
<Evil0ne> yes
<ial> yes
<bor_venin> sweet
<Evil0ne> and cfg reads ntfs/fat32
<ial> is there any reason i shouldnt force NTSC for all games in config.txt (CFG Loader)? seems like if i force NTSC on US games it works fine, and I need to force NTSC for PAL games. so why not just force all in the config.txt?
<Evil0ne> because some games adverslty react to it
<bor_venin> so does usb loader gx right? it said so on the release page, eventhough i never got it to work on fat32
<sexual> sure you can
<sexual> well of one game does he can change it
<sexual> if*
<ial> yea, id rather have to change the few games it adversely affects
<bor_venin> kinda sucks that i have been ripping about 25 DVD games to a WBFS HDD in the last two days
<bstock> bor_venin: you can rip back to the computer from the wbfs hd, though i prefer having a wbfs partition since games ripped to wbfs are scrubbed and therefore smaller
<ial> arent .wbfs files on NTFS scrubbed and just as small?
<Aeroslash> wb llots (again)
<Aeroslash> XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14ty again
<sexual> yes
<bstock> oh perhapse, if that's the case then yeah no diff
<sexual> or fat32

<assassins> plz telle mwhat to do
<Sina3> we dont know what to do.
<Sina3> your screwed.
<assassins> shadow who told me to install ios 36
<|Shadow|> yes i did
<assassins> ok
<assassins> after i install it
<Neo-Phyte> maybe you did it wrong shit happens
<|Shadow|> because that most time fixs the no vonerable ios
<|Shadow|> for hackmii installer
<assassins> yes ok
<assassins> after i did
<assassins> hbc frezz
<Neo-Phyte> you may have more issues then just that cant reinstall old nand?
<Sina3> shadow are you sure you gave him an original ios 36?
<assassins> yes he did
<Neo-Phyte> and start over or make a new nand from app
<|Shadow|> yes i did
<|Shadow|> v1042
<assassins> shadow can u tell me how to re install hbc again?
<|Shadow|> bannerbomb
<assassins> ok give me link
<|Shadow|> google it
<assassins> for 1 u know
<|Shadow|> first site will be it
<|Shadow|> on google
<assassins> k
<CobraX83> |Shadow|
<CobraX83> any idea about game forwarders why i may be getting an error
<|Shadow|> game forwarders?
<viince> assassin, ? softmod
<CobraX83> ya
<CobraX83> like a game channle for a wii game
<assassins> v1 - compatible with Wii Menu version 3.0 - 4.1
<assassins> v2 - compatible with Wii Menu version 4.2 (only)
<|Shadow|> gay
<CobraX83> that u can launch from the main menu
<|Shadow|> gay
<CobraX83> why is it gay
<|Shadow|> waste of space
<CobraX83> umm
<CobraX83> im not using the space for anything else
*Kipi hops on SheenaFox 'n' snugs
<assassins> ? list
<CobraX83> they take up like 6 blovksds
<|Shadow|> u only have 512MB and wii menu is int aht space too
<SheenaFox> O:
<CobraX83> i have 1680 free
*SheenaFox floof
<CobraX83> dude
<|Shadow|> so u dont play ww/vc?
<CobraX83> i use my 500 gig to store most things
<assassins> ? bannerbomb
<CobraX83> all my wii space otherwise i have saved on sd in front
<CobraX83> ya
*Kipi collapses
<|Shadow|> so u take space up with ww/vc
<CobraX83> on my 2 gig i have all the vc i need and rb 2 tracks and still have 600 mb free
<|Shadow|> u have to have space to laod ww/vc off sd
<|Shadow|> it gets laoded into the space then ran
<CobraX83> ya and i have plenty
<|Shadow|> its not purly running off the sd card
<CobraX83> yo i know this i installed a wiikey first day they came out and have done everything ever since no issues just asking how to get them to work
<|Shadow|> i can care less for them to be working
<|Shadow|> because its pointless
<|Shadow|> when usb laoder is all u need
<CobraX83> umm its not pointless if it works...
<|Shadow|> and has the covers and all
<|Shadow|> and it works
<|Shadow|> usb laoder cfg
<CobraX83> i know i use that with a channel forwarder as wel
<|Shadow|> then carry on useing it
<CobraX83> i like the look of games in their own box ):
<|Shadow|> exactly
<|Shadow|> nice box art in cfg
<CobraX83> ya like on the menu not through loader, exactly
<|Shadow|> and can see front and back :)

<Sina3> so does anyone know how to make homebrew app iso forwarders?
<Arimil> Can someone help me cIOS38r17 installer isn't working it keeps giving me error ret = -1035
<rosch> no
<rosch> no help for cios
<rosch> 1035 = you're a dirty dirty pirate
<Arimil> >.> i'm trying to run netflix without waiting a week for a disc in the mail
<Arimil> i downloaded the netflix disc iso
<Arimil> but can't get it to work
<rosch> just wait
<rosch> we can't help you
<rosch> those steps lead to piracy
<Arimil> do you know where i can get help?
<rosch> it's not up to me
<rosch> yes and no
<rosch> telling you would be helping you
<rosch> lol
<Arimil> thanks your awesome
<rosch> good thing athenon is asleep
<rosch> he would've kbed you right away
<rosch> unelss we summon him
<rosch> ATHENON ATHENO NATHENON
<Warpedfla> rosch, will i do?
<rosch> lol
<rosch> haha i was just kidding
<Warpedfla> :P
<rosch> your name sounds like warbles
<Warpedfla> if you want to direct people to gbatemp i dont mind
<Warpedfla> warpedflash = warbles?
<rosch> lol
<rosch> warbles!
<Athenon> !kban arimil
<Warpedfla> Athenon with his banhammer of evilness
<Athenon> hehe :)
<rosch> ughh
<rosch> i'm -.-
<|Shadow|> give it the fuck up
<Evil0ne> hah
*rosch rages.
<Austin> rosch: USE DRAGON RAGE
*rosch uses FLOP instead. It's super effective!
<Austin> misty: you're a water pokemon expert, control that thing
<rosch> quick i need a line wrap function
<tpw_rules> why?
<rosch> to word wrap text
<Athenon> just write one
<Athenon> its like 4 lines
<|Shadow|> u can always direct them to another channel to get them out of here
<|Shadow|> Warpedfla
<rosch> what there's no way word wrap is 4 lines
<Athenon> if the line is longer than a set amount (the length of the line), replace the previous space with a \n
<Athenon> how is that much longer than 4 lines?
<rosch> do it in pseudocode
<|Shadow|> hey Austin
<rosch> oh let's say you don't have \n
<|Shadow|> hows it been going?
<Athenon> why would you not have \n or endl or something?
<tpw_rules> then it's not possible
<rosch> cause GRRLIB_PrintfTTF doesn't have it
<rosch> it's not an IO stream
<Athenon> tpw_rules: its certainly still possible, you just have to know the mechanism by which you have to go to a new line
<rosch> i've written one wordwrap before
<rosch> it's ugly and gross
<rosch> it's in FLM
<rosch> i'm jus thinking of a better way to do it
<Athenon> k, in java its still the same....just instead of \n you just increment the y value by a set amount
<rosch> http://code.google.com/p/fmylife/source/browse/trunk/FMyLife/source/fmylife.cpp
<rosch> scroll down to... drawText()
<rosch> that's pretty much how i have to do it
<rosch> i can simplify it a little now
<rosch> since i can get the width of a line of text
<rosch> still gotta break the line of text into words
<Athenon> that looks roughly how i'd do it...
<Athenon> i dont see how thats all uber complicated though ;P
<rosch> lol it's just ugly and > 4 lines
<Athenon> i can make roughly the same method in java in half the lines xP
<rosch> java is easier
<rosch> i have StringTokenizer
<Athenon> stringtokenizer is dumb
<Athenon> ever since scanner came out, tokenizer is antiquated
<rosch> or scanner
<rosch> or whatever it's been awhile
<rosch> i forgot what i used
<Athenon> strings are a pain in c++....one of the reason its not exactly my language of choice
<rosch> man segoeui is sexy
<Athenon> oh, and re: 4 lines....i bet its right around there when using java and regular console output ;P
<Athenon> course it also depends on what you consider a "line"
<Athenon> ill just put that entire drawText() func on one line and claim its way shorter than you say :D
<rosch> i guess i could just make a lookup table
<rosch> lol
<Athenon> damn its been forever since ive written something decent in java or php.....i want to write something but i got nothing useful to write
<Perseid> http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Comcast-BitTorrent-Ares-eDonkey-FastTrack,10839.html
<Gandalph> lol, sounds like me. I read up on html, c++, php, but not sure what to actually write.
<Gandalph> now learning c#
<Athenon> yeah. all the cool stuff ive wanted to write....ive already written or would take far longer than i wish to spend to do it by myself xP
<rosch> how big is a char again
<rosch> u8?
<rosch> u16?
<Athenon> a char in ascii is 8 bytes
<Athenon> unicode is 16
<Gandalph> You mean 8 bits?
<tpw_rules> yes
<Athenon> hmm yes indeed
<Athenon> although unicode is more than 16 bits i think ja?
<Gandalph> 16 bit
<Gandalph> looking at my c# study guide
<Athenon> utf-8 is extendable to 4 byes, actually
<Gandalph> 0-65535
<Athenon> UTF-8 (which uses one byte for any ASCII characters, which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters)
<Athenon> thats why its represented by 4 hex chars
<rosch> FFFUUU buffer overrun
<Athenon> so its 0-65534 xP
<Athenon> wait no youre right
<Athenon> this is what i get for having a shitty professor for this crap
<tpw_rules> hahaha
<tpw_rules> it's 0-65535
<Athenon> yeah
<Athenon> 65536 different chars
<Athenon> although.....
<Gandalph> Yeah. using a unsigned int
<Gandalph> If I was wrong, then this book would be wrong, lol.
<SLM-tecra> Perseid somehow those numbers dont sit well with me
<Athenon> its 32 bits though...4 bytes....max though
<rosch> what's wrong with this
<rosch> http://pastebin.org/391601
<Aeroslash> night all
<Athenon> Gandalph: given the atrocities ive seen in my data structures and structure of programming languages books...i wouldnt be surprised
<SLM-tecra> i mean $16 mil for the class action suit is shit! got to be more than 1,000,000 people who have comcast during that period. not to mention lets say less have filed suit
<Gandalph> Yeah I've seen a few messed up books.
<SLM-tecra> should be entitled to a lot more $
<Athenon> oh look we have a Node....lets make its left and right children both public!
<Gandalph> Isn't it 2 hex = 1 byte. 4 bit per hex
<Athenon> stupid pieces of crap
<SLM-tecra> comcast just doesnt want to pay out
<tpw_rules> i don't really see anything wrong
<rosch> nevermind
<tpw_rules> :/
<rosch> i know hwat i did wrong
<tpw_rules> what?
<Athenon> yeah
<Perseid> I dunno. I don't know much about it. I only pasted it to inform Comcast customers that they have a free $16 waiting for them.
<rosch> okay i don't know what i did wrong
<rosch> all i know
<tpw_rules> Athenon: that sucks
<rosch> it's hanging on that part
<Athenon> wait
<Perseid> Oh, they paid out. It just went mostly to the lawyers, as it always does in class-action suits.
<Athenon> hmmmmmmmm
<SLM-tecra> 3 million to lawayers it said
<tpw_rules> is it GRRLIB_WidthTTF's fault?
<SLM-tecra> $13 to customers
<rosch> http://grrlib.santo.fr/doc/group___all_func.html#ga0d6122453e44eca5d0defaa66d01b55b
<rosch> maybe
<SLM-tecra> mill*
<Athenon> 1 hex can represent 16 chars, and 16^4 = 65536, so all 4 bytes should be in there
<SLM-tecra> less than a million customers
<SLM-tecra> so weak
<tpw_rules> no
<Athenon> oh wait
<tpw_rules> you FAIL
<Gandalph> lol
<tpw_rules> 4 bytes is ~4 billion
<Athenon> utf-8 is 32 bits..........2^32=4294967296
<Athenon> so its 0 -4294967295
*SLM-tecra chex his comcast stock
<Perseid> $16m is enough. Nobody will ever do that again now. That's the real result of the lawsuit for most of us.
<Athenon> and the 4-hex notation represents the first 65536 im guessing
<Perseid> I mean, let's say you were throttled. It was lame, but what real harm did it cause you? You got your porn 5 minutes later than you should have?
<Athenon> idk...im starting to care less and less tbh xP
<rosch> okay i figured out what was wrong
<rosch> WidthTTF chokes on char values < 32
<Athenon> im a software engineer, not a hardware engineer :P
<Perseid> Hmm. Perhaps they could have afforded more after all. "Total equity $ 42,721 million (2009)"
<Athenon> and i dont plan to ever write compilers or create new languages or stuff like that....so XD
<rosch> i have
<rosch> its' fun stuff
<rosch> ever try to write to run an interpreted language
<rosch> with only 3 8-bit registers
<rosch> it's not fun
<rosch> it drives you mad
<rosch> INSANE
<Athenon> ive written in assembly....that was pain enough for me
<rosch> have you written in 6502 assembly
<rosch> MAD I TELL YOU
<Athenon> im not sure what assembly it was tbh
<Gandalph> 6502 assembly sounds familiar. I think I read an online study guide for that a couple years back for the heck ot learning it.
<Gandalph> From what I'm reading, utf-8 is 8 bit (hence utf-8). utf-32 would be 32 bit, utf-16 being 16 bit. could be reading it wrong (wiki)
<Athenon> Gandalph: utf-8 is expandable to 4 bytes depending on the character
*tpw_rules <3 6502 assembly
<tpw_rules> rosch: you fail
<rosch> 6502 is what was used in nes
<tpw_rules> yup
<rosch> NO YOU
<tpw_rules> i wrote for nes
<tpw_rules> it's awesome
<rosch> mad? MAD?
<rosch> http://members.shaw.ca/jparasite/lol6502/stdlib.65s
<tpw_rules> not too easy, but fun
<Gandalph> for nes, wasn't that assembly I read then.
<tpw_rules> aww, all it needs is comments
<rosch> i wrote that
<rosch> it's not even done yet
<rosch> i went MAD
<tpw_rules> well why are you writing so much?
<rosch> that's just the standard libary
<rosch> it was for a compiler's class
<tpw_rules> porting c or something?
<tpw_rules> oh
<rosch> i made an LOLCODE to 6502 compiler
<Gandalph> Athenon, doesn't that just mean it can be expanded to utf-32?
<tpw_rules> hah
<tpw_rules> 6502 is nice
<tpw_rules> wanna see my pong? :P
<rosch> pong is awesome
<tpw_rules> i'm working on picross
<Athenon> Gandalph: nah, its a different standard i believe
<rosch> if i'm using wchar_t
<tpw_rules> and my pong has 12a06r14t09i06f03i08c05i14a11l 09i08n14t06e05l10l08i08g03e08n14c08e04!
<rosch> how do i tell this stupid thing
<rosch> to switch to a different language
<tpw_rules> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4355351/tpwpong.nes
<rosch> like "USE JAPANESE CHARSET" or whatever
<Gandalph> I'm playing picross 3d. challenging.
<tpw_rules> eek
<Arimil> is it safe to delete the hackmii folder on the sdcard?
<rosch> didn't we ban you earlier
<Arimil> yup
<Gandalph> lol
<Athenon> utf-32 is a constant 32 bits....theres probably other differences too, but i dont feel like looking them up because im in the middle of watching degrassi xP
<tpw_rules> - !kban ban evasion
<Arimil> question isn't related to that though its about hackmii
<rosch> tpw_rules what's the linux version of charmap
<Gandalph> I'm watching hell's kitchen :)
<Arimil> or rather the folder says bootmii
<tpw_rules> rosch: dunno
<Gandalph> If you don't want to use bootmii, then delete it. ;)
<rosch> bah
<rosch> why does charmap show "!" as 33
<rosch> but in printf it's 32
<rosch> oh nevermind
<rosch> i'm ertarded
<rosch> 32 is SPACE
<Arimil> also once it's modded I don't need the boot file anymore do i?
<Gandalph> Depends if you want to boot into bootmii or not, should something go wrong.
<Gandalph> best to just rename the folder.
<Arimil> well if it does i could just take the sdcard out and put the files back on my pc right?
<rosch> anyone want to test my test app
<Sonic41> You could have 2 SD cards
<zc00gii> sure
<zc00gii> iirc tho
<Sonic41> And what's the app, rosch?
<rosch> i'm trying to get unicode to work
<zc00gii> you can config it to automatically boot the sysmenu
<rosch> so it's just a loop that shows a bunch of characters
<Gandalph> bootmii folder is only a few kb in size. no need to delete.
<rosch> from 32 to 512
<Arimil> having to get up every time the system gets turned on to press the reset button is a pain :p
<rosch> use autoboot
<rosch> there's an .ini file
<rosch> uncomment out the autoboot
<Gandalph> rename the folder then.
<Arimil> wouldn't that defeat the purpose of it being there though? since you can't use it then
<Arimil> *shrug* i guess
<Arimil> autoboot it is :p
<zc00gii> Arimil: you can press a certain button and it'll boot into it
<zc00gii> with autoboot on
<Arimil> thought the wiimote didn't work in there
<rosch> athenon or whoever
<rosch> do you know how unicode is handled
<rosch> when GET an html page
<zc00gii> Arimil: no no I mean
<zc00gii> with a gc controller or on the wii buttons
<Arimil> like hold the eject button while turning it on?
<Athenon> rosch: well, there are webpages named in japanese chars, so im thinking yes
<zc00gii> yeah
<zc00gii> or reset
<zc00gii> idk which
<rosch> i'm just trying to think
<rosch> if i do a GET using sockets
<Arimil> ok thanks everyone
<rosch> the data is transferred byte for byte
<Sonic41> Oh, by the way, I decided to pick back up on C++ studies
<IOS61> Sonic41: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<rosch> i'm just thinking, "how do i parse that"
<Athenon> right. strings arent parsed, just byte by byte
<Sonic41> Oh IOS61
<rosch> C++ studies
<rosch> Oh, by the way,
<rosch> I decided to pick back up
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<rosch> lol
<rosch> what's that? i went to back up my hard drive
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<tpw_rules> >_<
<Sonic41> lol
<rosch> oh no, where did my back up of my files go
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<tpw_rules> i lost my only hard drive back up
<rosch> IOS61 would you please back up
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<zc00gii> !rules
<IOS61> zc00gii: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<rosch> it's cause you're voiced
<tpw_rules> :D
<DefiantN> If you go on record saying you use p2p, you can get $13?
<rosch> can i get a voice
<tpw_rules> and opped (if i want)
<zc00gii> lolwut
<zc00gii> rosch: that's weird
<zc00gii> rosch: no
<zc00gii> <IOS61> 4. We have all the ops that we need - do not ask to be an op. If you
<zc00gii> 	are a regula helper you may be promoted to have voice and should we
<zc00gii> 	need more ops we will promote from there
<rosch> i am totally a regular helper
<zc00gii> you may be
<rosch> :D
<rosch> lol, back to development, who wanted to run this again
<rosch> sonic?
<Sonic41> I /try/ to be a regular helper. :P
<Sonic41> I'll run it. What's the app now?
<Athenon> i regularly......enforce rules XD
<zc00gii> btw
<rosch> it just shows unicode chars from 0x20 to some value
<zc00gii> C++ sucks
<rosch> let me upload it somewhere
<rosch> do you have wiiload?
<Sonic41> I do
<Sonic41> I set it up just the other day
<Sonic41> :D
<rosch> jesus christ 1.61mb for a dol
<rosch> what the hell
<Sonic41> Wow
<rosch> it includes the .ttf file i guess
<rosch> i don't know how big that is
<rosch> the .ttf file is 500kb
<Perseid> $16!
<rosch> http://www.mediafire.com/?u5mcqkliyu4
<rosch> it should show a white screen with black text
<Perseid> "It was Ubuntu ISOs. Really."
<DefiantN> 3million in lawyer fees
<rosch> i'm trying to figure out
<rosch> how html will be sent to my app
<Sonic41> Okay
<Sonic41> Lemme load up the HBC
<zc00gii> rosch: what are you trying to accomplish?
<DefiantN> "Your honor, comcast records clearly show this user was using p2p for porn"
<rosch> in my last version of FML
<rosch> bunch of french characters weren't supported
<rosch> or stuff like that
<zc00gii> no no
<zc00gii> like
<zc00gii> wtf are you doing?
<rosch> for this app?
<tpw_rules> yes
<rosch> oh i just displayed a bunch of characters
<rosch> that's all i wanted to see
<rosch> if it would show up
<rosch> it's just the chars from 0x20 to 0x1FF
<tpw_rules> no, what's the point of figuring all this out?
<rosch> i'm still lost
<tpw_rules> like why the word wrapping?
<tpw_rules> what do you need that for?
<rosch> oh, because i grab text from a website
<rosch> and display it
<rosch> need to wordwrap
<rosch> there's no automatic wordwrapping whatsoever
<tpw_rules> oh
<tpw_rules> what program?
<tpw_rules> didn't you do fml?
<rosch> www.wiibrew.org/FMyLife/
<rosch> yes
<rosch> this is what i'm fixing
<tpw_rules> just use the one from that
<rosch> so in the next version i'm trying to get unicode to work
<Sonic41> Okay
<Sonic41> The text shows up
<rosch> perfect
<Sonic41> I see symbols
<Sonic41> The alphabet
<rosch> good good
<Sonic41> And abunch of other letters that I don't care to learn about
<Sonic41> :P
<rosch> hmm...
<rosch> well segoeui doesn't look like it has other language support
<rosch> gonna try simsun
<Sonic41> Okay
<zc00gii> all this text makes me want to try something
<zc00gii> text talk*
<rosch> haah do somethign
<rosch> make a program
<zc00gii> (format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "
<zc00gii> test"
<zc00gii> ok, how did that display
<rosch> uhh?
<rosch> <@zc00gii> test"
<zc00gii> no like
<zc00gii> paste all of what I did
<rosch> <@zc00gii> (format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "
<rosch> [22:42] <@zc00gii> test"
<zc00gii> oh cool =D
<zc00gii> ERC> /l (format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline)
<zc00gii> <zc00gii> (format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "^M
<zc00gii> 	 PRIVMSG #wiihelp :test"
<Sonic41> Hmmm, I really wanna try making a program
<zc00gii> that's what I really did
<zc00gii> Sonic41: I'm making several =P
<Sonic41> Oh boy
<Sonic41> Yeah, I think I understand all the new stuff I learned today
<zc00gii> Sonic41: learn emacs and lisp
<zc00gii> seriously
<zc00gii> I could teach you
<zc00gii> I'm doing classes on freenode soon
<Sonic41> :O
<Sonic41> Sign me up, plz
<zc00gii> they already did python classes
<Sonic41> :( damn, I missed out on that
<zc00gii> there's logs....
<Sonic41> Okay
<zc00gii> Sonic41: did you join?
<Sonic41> Yep

<Sonic41> Most homebrew apps are open source, right?
<Galaxy|> most
<rosch> but not all
<Galaxy|> some of the really neat ones aren't
<Sonic41> Ah okay
<Sonic41> I plan to look at some of the source code in some apps
<Sonic41> To get a feel for what homebrew dev on the Wii is like :P
<drfsupercenter> 03off to bed
<rosch> it's easy
<Sonic41> I hope so
<|Shadow|> ops u mean?
<|Shadow|> yea because they r apart of the same group
<|Shadow|> then the 2 groups has friends in each so they get ops over there and visa versia
<zc00gii> oh hey Galaxy|, what's up? how's it been?
<Galaxy|> so so
<Galaxy|> its going
<zc00gii> I guess that's good
<rosch> ughh this wordwrap
<rosch> is so ugly

<Sonic41> Just a little text adventure, if possible
<Sonic41> I can at least try\
<rosch> you can
<rosch> actually

<rosch> i can probably implement it
<rosch> if you put some thought into it
<Sonic41> All right
<Sonic41> I'll try
<rosch> i can use it to test this JKLASLKJDA wordwrapping
<rosch> FU WORDWRAPPING
<rosch> FU TO HELL

<Sonic41> All right
<Sonic41> Let's do this
<Athenon> zc00gii: <killzzone> what if we have a softmoded wii <----- poor dude probably thought softmod meant "homebrewed"...............
<rosch> PROBABLY
<Sonic41> Yeah
<rosch> someone go msg him lol
<Sonic41> Perhaps I should've asked what his definition of softmod was
<IOS61> Sonic41: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Sonic41> I was going to ask it
<rosch> whoa whoa back up there sonic41
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<rosch> you just can't say softmod
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Athenon> we dont ban on "they MIGHT be breaking a rule"
<Sonic41> Oh
<Athenon> or kick*
<rosch> saying softmod is like a back up of warez piracy
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<rosch> hahaha
<rosch> did you unban him
<rosch> i'll tell him to come back in
<Athenon> hes only kicked, not banned
<Athenon> however, you might tell him that if he IS referring to piracy, ill kban him myself next time ;P
<Viromike> ? downgrade
<rosch> bah
<rosch> athenon wants to know
<rosch> what you meant by softmod
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<rosch> damn it IOS61 DIAF
<rosch> if it's piracy softmod then no
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<killzzone> hehe
<rosch> if it's homebrew softmod then yes
<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.

<IOS61> rosch: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Athenon> the definition of "softmod" is in the rules...so read them, and your speaking of softmod from henceforth will be assumed to use that definition
<killzzone> ok im confused
<Athenon> rosch: quit abusing the freaking bots
<Athenon> killzzone: <Athenon> the definition of "softmod" is in the rules...so read them, and your speaking of softmod from henceforth will be assumed to use that definition
<rosch> i'm trying not to say soft*mod
<Athenon> speaking/usage

*Damos 13hugs
<Damos> 13hey Alt|eXAKR
<KBK> Okey dokey
<KBK> So;
<House> ? list
<Alt|eXAKR> I'm eXAKR
<Alt|eXAKR> Clone
<Alt|eXAKR> Trying to test something
<Damos> 13sorry Alt|eXAKR
<Alt|eXAKR> !eXAKR\
<House> anyone ehre?
<Alt|eXAKR> !eXAKR
<Alt|eXAKR> Hmmm
<Alt|eXAKR> Doesn't work
<booyah> yes.
<Damos> 13okay Alt|eXAKR
<Alt|eXAKR> Someone try doing !eXAKR
<House> can i download games here or is it jsut the wii firmwares and stuff?
<Damos> 13in black?
<KBK> I've been using HBC for a while, since probably a few months before the freeloader was killed. However, I've been keeping versions of the firmware up to date as well so I could continue to use the shopping channel and use the updated SD channel, etc.
<Damos> !eXAKR
<booyah> you cannot get games here.
<Alt|eXAKR> Nope
<House> ok
<House> thank yu
<Alt|eXAKR> Try again
<House> you*
<Alt|eXAKR> !eXAKR
<Damos> 13sorry Alt|eXAKR \
<Damos> 13-\
<Damos> !eXAKR
<KBK> I'm not updating to 4.3, obviously, until HBC is updated at least, or perhaps never
<KBK> Now
<WiiPower> there are shop channel updaters that just update the shop channel and the required IOS
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Damos> 13doesn't work Alt|eXAKR
<WiiPower> then you are still able to use HBC and the shop channel
<KBK> I understand there are a few programs I can use to update shopping channel without the firmware -
<eonity> !eXAKR
<KBK> yeah, that
<WiiPower> and if you are on 4.x already, you also keep the sd menu
<Damos> 13okay eonity
<Ice> I want Mario Kart Banana hack :p
<Alt|eXAKR> !eXAKR
<Damos> 13why are you nick cha=ging Alt|eXAKR
<^Wulfgar^> we don't deal with warez
<eonity> !eXAKR
<WiiPower> and your problem is?
<^Wulfgar^> this is an 'informational' chat
<Damos> 13you did it again eonity
<KBK> wiibrew wiki warns against using any of them, as they make permanent changes to the system, or mentions I need to use something to downgrade first so I can install them
<Damos> 13Kids WB eXAKR
<booyah> damn, I thought it was a sex chat
<KBK> At one point it's mentioned that I should have a backup just in case I brick my console, but I don't have a clue where to even start with this kind of thing, or which of the updaters is recommended
<IOS61> KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
*booyah puts away his mario thong
<WiiPower> if you are still on 4.1, your brick risk by updating is higher than the risk when using one of the shop channel updaters
*eXAKR rolls a giant corn into the path of Damos
<KBK> Indeed, I read the rules. I'm not asking for a backup, or how to pirate things
<IOS61> KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
*Damos 13uses dig
<WiiPower> i think it just looks for the word
<WiiPower> do a nand backup with BootMii
<IOS61> WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<KBK> ah
<eXAKR> Is this script supposed to go into Remote or Users>
<eXAKR> *?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Remote lol
<KBK> ehe
<WiiPower> Are you able to install BootMii to boot2 with the hackmii installer?
<Damos> 13LLOTS!
*Damos 13hugs
<KBK> as far as I know, I installed bootmii when I updated HBC a few months back
<WiiPower> you can install it to boot2 and as IOS
<WiiPower> they are both different things
<KBK> as for using it to backup, I'd need to find instructions
<IOS61> KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<eXAKR> OK
<WiiPower> and BootMii IOS is next to useless for 99% of people
<eXAKR> Someone try !eXAKR again
<Espeon> !exakr
<Espeon> !eXAKR
<eXAKR> Nope
<Espeon> lol
<WiiPower> i still recommend creating a nand backup with it, but don't ever try to restore it unless you have BootMii boot2
<IOS61> WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<eXAKR> Fail
<KBK> I think I'm on 4.2, I'm not sure
<KBK> I... should go check
<WiiPower> shup up IOS61!
<KBK> I wonder
<KBK> back up
<IOS61> KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<KBK> dang, I tried
<eXAKR> Maybe it's the variables
<KBK> I'll be back in a few secs
<Damos> 13Hey Quany
<KBK> I'm on 4.2E
<WiiPower> I don't see why the ship channel updaters would require the trucha bug/a patched IOS
<KBK> so I should first and foremost look up instructions on making a b@ckup with bootmii
<KBK> just in case I explode something
<WiiPower> 1st thing you should do is checking if you can get BootMiit boot2, or if you have it already
<eXAKR> OK try again
<WiiPower> so just run the hackmii installer(works from HBC as well)
<WiiPower> and see what it says
<a_clone> !exakr
<a_clone> ...
<WiiPower> about doing the bakkup, start BootMii(there's an option in HBC for it) and navigate trough its menu to actually do the backkup
<KBK> It stores the bakup on the SD?
<WiiPower> it uses the reset, power and eject button for navigation, but you can use a GC controller as well if you have one
<WiiPower> yes
<KBK> cool
<KBK> And yeah, I have GC controllers in abundance
<eXAKR> faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail
<KBK> Does the process take very long?
<KBK> Do you know?
<WiiPower> If BootMii doesn't show up when selecting it in HBC, you either don't have BootMii IOS installed, or the files are missing on sd card
<bleughergh> !exakr
<WiiPower> in both cases, just reinstall it
<WiiPower> 10-20 minutes maxy
<KBK> it's possible that updating to 4.2E removed it... though I know that's been circumvented in recent HB updates
<bleughergh> !exakr
<House> i last updated my wii with 3.2u is there anypoint in going with a newer firmwar?
<Damos> 13LOL
<eXAKR> fail
<eXAKR> just fail
*eXAKR latches onto himself and starts nibbling non-stop.
<WiiPower> if you used the official way to udate, then BootMii IOS was deleted, but you can always just reinstall it(when you are on 4.2 or lower)
<WiiPower> BootMii boot2 would also have been deinstalled, but would also be posible to reinstall(and highly recommended)
<KBK> once I've done that - is there a shop (and other) channel updater that you've personally used or like?
<WiiPower> no, i'm not using the ship channel
<^Wulfgar^> not unless a game requires it...and right now there aren't any afaik
<House> ok
<WiiPower> and i have plenty patched IOS, so i maybe wouldn't notice if the installer requires it or not
<WiiPower> you can just try them
<bleughergh> !exakr
<WiiPower> worst case should be a broken shop channel until you found a working installer
<House> i dont wanna bother with it if its unnecessary
<KBK> fair enough
<KBK> Thanks for listening, I'm not sure how borderline this is to the rules, or how often people come to ask similar stuff
<WiiPower> i can't stress it enough that the nand bakkup will only do you any good if you have BootMii boot2 or a hardware nand programmer
<bleughergh> rbr
<WiiPower> with skipping the oddicial update, and the shop channel installers, we are perfectly within the rules of this channel
<KBK> of course
<WiiPower> or the rules on WiiBrew which are basically the same
<KBK> I have that highlighted on my notes
<^Wulfgar^> is your wii chipped or softmodded?
<House> softmodded
<KBK> I'm fine with installing HBC and things like that, but stuff that could potentially corrupt things is beyond my experience so far
<House> whats the point of chipping it?
<BLERUERHGUEHGH> !exakr
<BLERUERHGUEHGH> ......
<Skylands> 10not that word
*Skylands shot
<WiiPower> as long you don't have any patched IOS installed, i would say it's difficult to brick the wii
<booyah> playing burnt backups, gc games
<House> i do both
<Espeon> ..
<^Wulfgar^> if it's softmodded, then I'd use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide...at the end you'll be on 4.1...which is the place to be
<BLERUERHGUEHGH> Someone else try it
<WiiPower> most stuff you read where people bricked their Wiis on purpose(stupidity), they used patched IOS, without them the apps that bricked wouldn't been able to do "their job"
<Skylands> 10!exakr
<House> but whats the point of going from 3.2 to 4.1 if no games require it?
<Espeon> I can't remember but I think the vars are messed up before it has been used once
<BLERUERHGUEHGH> ...
<WiiPower> stuff like deleting IOS, system menu, install corrupted channels etc. is not directly possible on a Wii with 4.2 system menu
<BLERUERHGUEHGH> K try again
<House> does anyone here have an i4 im wondering if the signal issues are over exaggerated or not?
<House> oops sorry
<House> not enough sleep apparently
<Espeon> this should probably be done somewhere else
<Espeon> !exakr
<^Wulfgar^> 4.1 fixes a bug in wii sports resort
<eXAKR> nope
<KBK> ah, here it is
<eXAKR> maybe a #test
<House> i dont play it anyways becasue i dont have the addon for the controller i forget what its called
<KBK> "warning: Using dop-shop makes permanent changes to NAND and should be used with caution"
<WellyJ> motionplus
<^Wulfgar^> motion plus
<eXAKR> ANYWAY
<eXAKR> THIS DOESN'T WORK.
<|lucid|> i was on 3.2 for the longest time
<House> there ay go
<House> ya*
<|lucid|> with priiloader and all games working
<|lucid|> cept havent played any wiimotion plus crap
<WiiPower> it should only touch the shop channel and its IOS, which should be IOS61
<House> not sure if i installed the preloader
<Espeon> gtg
<WiiPower> you could even delete both without getting any trouble
<^Wulfgar^> preloader is outdated...it's now priiloader
<|lucid|> 4.1 has a bunch of updated ios files and seems to be more stable
<eXAKR> D:
<WiiPower> if you had some weird setup where your system menu was set to use IOS61 as system menu IOS, then it could brick, but even then only if the IOS61 installation completely fails
<House> that april fools joke really pissed me off
<House> been to long since ive used my wii
<WiiPower> which is something i have heard of yet
<House> i gotta find some goodgames
<WiiPower> n't*
<House> lol
<WiiPower> http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSCU
<WiiPower> might be the better option, i don't know why dop-shop says it needs a trucha bugged IOS
<WiiPower> still worst case: it just doesn't work
<KBK> ooh, I think I looked at this one before
<KBK> Cool
<KBK> Well, it's 2am here (Australia), and I'd prefer to be rested before I attempt something here, so as to not miss any vital steps or instructions. I appreciate the help and I may be back if things go horribly wrong and I need help
<KBK> thanks again, goodnight
<WiiPower> just get back here then
<WiiPower> there sure will be somebody who is able to help you
<KBK> awesome. I'll make sure to be here before I start so I can dive for the computer if something looks like it's going wrong

<Quanyails> 7Question; what would you say is the best online ringtone maker? o3o
<Zu-Zu> ?
<drf|work> um
<drf|work> what do you mean ringtone maker?
<Zu-Zu> dont know
<Sparky> 2o3o
<drf|work> if you just use MIDIs
<drf|work> just put them on the phone
<drf|work> o.o
<Zu-Zu> a website that makes ringtones?
<drf|work> if you want mp3s
<drf|work> go download Audacity
<drf|work> and do it yourself
<Quanyails> 7Yes, I meant MP3s; all right, DRF, I guess.
<drf|work> don't use websites
<drf|work> they make terrible quality
<drf|work> just remember this: most phones go to voicemail after 25 seconds, so that's how long the ringtone should be.
<drf|work> just cut it down in Audacity, save it as mp3 (you might need the lame_enc.dll file)
<drf|work> transfer it to phone

<drf|work> it's my dad's old SUV
<Glacymr> 12all the info is there
<drf|work> Mercury Mountaineer, from 2000
<drf|work> back when it first came out
<drf|work> like a month ago he bought a Cadillac for him
<drf|work> and gave my sister and me his SUV
<drf|work> so :)
<Altair> either a 2006 saab 9-3 or a 2007 accord
<Altair> lol
<drf|work> LOL Saab
<drf|work> I actually like Honda
<drf|work> just that the Mercury drives completely different
<drf|work> so I finally got used to driving that
<drf|work> then last night I took my mom's Honda Odyssey minivan
<drf|work> and was like "Frick, how do I use this thing"
<drf|work> XD
<Altair> XD
<Altair> i'm used to a dodge
<Altair> avenger
<Altair> i tried driving my dad's Prius and
<Altair> yeah ><
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> Never drove a Prius.
<drf|work> who makes those anyway?
<Altair> Toyota
<drf|work> ah
<drf|work> I'm not a big Toyota fan
<drf|work> but Honda, I liek their cars
<Altair> Neither am I lol
<Altair> It like...
<Altair> lags
<drf|work> I've driven a Civic, those are pretty nice
<Altair> when you hit the accelerator
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Testing, testing.
<drf|work> heh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yay, it works.
<drf|work> check, check, 123
<Altair> "flooring" it takes 5 seconds to go
<drf|work> LOL
<Altair> Also wb
<Altair> srsly
<drf|work> see, the thing with my mom's Honda
<drf|work> it accelerates just as fast as anything else
<drf|work> you just have to push harder on the petal
<drf|work> that p-ssed me off about American cars for a while
<drf|work> how they speed up superfast
<drf|work> but apparently some people like that?
<drf|work> I got used to it LOL
<Altair> lol
<Altair> the Avenger does that
<drf|work> I think it's common of American car companies
<drf|work> I mean, I got used to it
<drf|work> but I learned to drive in a Honda
<drf|work> so I was all FFFF whenever I'd drive a Ford/GM/Chevy
<Altair> I don't mind it, it's not like flooring a sports car but eh
<drf|work> er Chrysler
<drf|work> w/e
<Altair> lol
<Altair> lag
<drf|work> I was never really a car person
<drf|work> like as long as it has 4 wheels and the engine works it's fine with me
<drf|work> but one of my friends is a super car geek
<drf|work> and he taught me some stuff XD
<Altair> I used to be car-obsessed a long time ago, talking elementary school lol
<drf|work> heh
<Altair> but yeah I just want something that works and doesn't look like poo
<drf|work> well I don't have a parent that works for a car company
*Glacymr gets Altair's car in pimp my ride
<drf|work> so I was never ito them as a child
*Altair enters his dad's Prius in it :O
<Altair> well neither did I XD
<drf|work> well it seems all too common
<drf|work> where soemone's parent will work for one of the big 3
<drf|work> so they grow up all into cars
<Altair> I blame it on Hot Weels
<Altair> eh
<drf|work> LOL Hot Wheels
<drf|work> see
<drf|work> I played with LEGOs
<drf|work> not those./
<Altair> I played with Hot Weels, LEGO and K'nex or whatever it's called
<drf|work> LOL K'nex
<drf|work> I tried those once
<drf|work> and went back tO LEGO
<Altair> I liked K'nex more than LEGO xD idk
<drf|work> heh
<zu-zuXtimeshift> hi shadows
<drf|work> well you can do some legit amazing things with LEGO
<Altair> Maybe because I had a solar powered set from knex lol
<Altair> truely
<drf|work> I have a few of their robotics kits
<Altair> I never had the programmable block and robotic kits etc
<drf|work> and I used to make cars out of them and stuff XD
<drf|work> like before I got the RCX even
<drf|work> I had a motor and a box that would go forward/backward
<drf|work> so I'd make makeshift RC cars
<drf|work> and use a really long wire
<drf|work> LOL
<Altair> XD
<drf|work> here we go
<Altair> I'd make these huge car-like things out of K'nex
<drf|work> got Android 2.2 running great on my Droid
<Altair> :O
<drf|work> I just had to totally wipe it >_>
<drf|work> which is fine as I have a backup
<Altair> Somehow there's a way
<drf|work> of course
<drf|work> I need to go download the software
<drf|work> to restore it
<Altair> you can get Android on the iPhone
<drf|work> LOL

<Ice> and also, let it be known, shooters are very low in my genre pereference.
<Perseid> Naughty Dog abandoned Crash many years ago. They only did the first 3 I think.

<Perseid> Then Jak and Daxter on the PS2.
<Ice> yeah
<Ice> it's dumb

<junh1024-XDCC> [23:16] <Damos> okay I was downloading some PokeMusic from drf and I downloaded this one song that is sung by Britteny Spears <-- yup, from the M1 soundtrack, was in the credits for half a minuite, and almost totally unrelated to pokemon
<Ice> At least Kindgom Hearts 3(III)D will be launching with the 3DS
<Perseid> The days of console exclusives are ending.
<MB> uh there is nothign announced mainline kh yet
<Perseid> The costs of making a game far outweigh the costs of porting one.
<MB> so i dunno where u get that from
<Ice> MB, yeah it was at E3
<MB> no it wasnt
<Ice> It showed Kingdom Hearts 3DS, and it's been reported
<MB> a name on a list isnt not an announcement
<Ice> that it's a sequel to Kingdom Hearts II
<MB> nothign about it bneing mainline
<Perseid> That's just storywise.
<Damos> 13i know why did britteny sing
<MB> all the stories link
<Damos> 13that song
<Ice> well
<Perseid> There have been quite a few KH games on Nintendo systems. Nothing new.
<Perseid> Portables, that is.
<MB> on handhelds
<Ice> yeah but on nintendo DS and the re-coded or 356/2 game...
<Ice> yuck
<MB> altho i wouldnt be surprised to see a nintendo wii or wiihd kh
<MB> fits the demographic
<Ice> Also a new Assassins Creed for the 3DS
<Damos> 13I'm going on a discovery flight this saturday
<Ice> :o
<Damos> 13I'm going to need to fly FSX for some last minute practice
<Perseid> 3DS is gonna rock.
<Lugianite> 2hm
<Damos> 13in a ceesna
<Damos> 13skyhawk
<Espeon> barrel rolls. do them.
<Tarawa> they should just skip the 3d sillyness, and boost the system's performance even more
*Aeroslash does a barrel roll
<Brother> Nuj
<MB> then it wouldnt have anythign distinguishing itself
<Brother> u
<Aeroslash> But Peppy told me to do one D:
<Brother> peppy is annoying
<Brother> always has been
<junh1024-XDCC> they just put it in for the lulz, you know?
<Tarawa> better to distinguish it self with real features, than gimicks
<MB> didnt i hear that before
<MB> o yea
<Aeroslash> yeah, Peppy's more annoying than Slippy
<junh1024-XDCC> around 2000 there was an ouburst of lil pop stars of brtney spears wannabes, if you remember
<MB> ds and wii
<Aeroslash> I actually don't mind Slippy
<junh1024-XDCC> amd then they all disappeared
<MB> that certainly blew up in nintendos face
<Aeroslash> hi Hawkie
<MB> shoudl have dropped the "gimmicks" and go for power liek psp and ps3
<Brother> ohai hawkie
<MB> and sel more units
<MB> o wait
<Tarawa> games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
<MB> they sold less
<Perseid> Yeah, because that worked so well for Sony.
<Tarawa> lke metoid prime hunters, and such
<Tarawa> sony's problem is the price
<Perseid> Tarawa: You haven't played many DS games.
<Tarawa> nope
<Ice> <Tarawa> games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
<Ice> Well, now
<Ice> the slider pad fixes that problem!
<Hawkie> Hey
<Ice> for the 3DS
<Tarawa> no, its still no where near as accurate as a nipple stick
<Ice> well, not for DS games, since they already have the flaw
<Tarawa> and you have to hold your hands at an un godly angle
<Ice> the handheld department hasn't screamed out to me so much except for LOZ handheld games.
<Ice> and the Sonic RPG. :D
<MB> talk about poor games
<Ice> Well, I can't pass up on Zelda
<Ice> and I can't pass up on a Sonic game and an RPG, so..Sonic...on an RPG?
<Ice> Gotta go for it!
<MB> sonics been shit for years now
<MB> and the rpg oen is even worse
<Ice> I really can't imagine why, just the fact that it's rpg makes it cool
<Ice> Meh, I know they'll get it right though, lots of people say Sonic Colors is the bomb
<Espeon> zz
<MB> lots of ppl, who didnt play it
<Ice> psh, from e3 :p
<MB> thats not lots
<Ice> Plus, I like the show Sonic X.
<MB> and i recall them saying the same shit with unleashed :P
<Brother> whats up
<Ice> So, even if the gameplay is bad, I can get a Sonic X movie on a video game.
<Ice> Since so far, Sonic, Tails, and Amy are confirmed chars so far in Sonic Colors...
<Glacymr> 12murr
<TheDarkAc> evening a;;
<TheDarkAc> *all
<Glacymr> 12hi Hawkie
<MB> so basially they could sell u poo, as long as it has sonic on it u will buy? :P
<Athenon> howdy
<Ice> Well, it has to meet criteria
<Fysx> spikey poo?
<Ice> Not a spin-off part of the Sonic Series, and an actual considerable genre
<Ice> like Platform, Adventure
<Ice> and RPG is unpassable
<Ice> if it's a handheld Sonic and it's not an RPG, it probably sux
<TheDarkAc> so, 4.3 kills homebrew?
<Athenon> no
<Athenon> it kills hbc
<Athenon> and dvdx
<TheDarkAc> ah
<TheDarkAc> oh...
<Ice> However, if I'm a fanboy of anything
<Ice> I'd have to be a fanboy of Kid Icarus..
<Ice> :D
<Athenon> homebrew in general is still acessible via indiana pwns and smash stack
<TheDarkAc> ah, so if the title id for HBC and DVDX were changed, it'd work again?
<Espeon> =o
<TheDarkAc> in theory?
<Athenon> i dont know about dvdx.....but the ios hbc uses has to be changed in addition....and then it would work, yeah
<TheDarkAc> but it's not like anyone actually uses the shop channel anyway :P
<Ice> I cried when I saw him say "Sorry to keep you waiting" at E3.
<Athenon> erm yeah, lots of people do
<TheDarkAc> seriously?
<Athenon> why would they not?
<TheDarkAc> i never have... all the old games on the shop channel are available through HBC emulators anyway
<TheDarkAc> and the little indie games on the shop channel, i already have on the PC
<Athenon> if you would kindly READ THE FREAKING RULES, youd know we dont support piracy and therefore dont support games through emulators
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Ice> It's okay Pit *sniffles* I missed you so much for 19 years! I forgive you!
<MuzerNtbk> Athenon, we support games through emulators
<MuzerNtbk> just to be irritating
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<TheDarkAc> i own all the games that i have on roms.... i dumped most of them myself anyway.... so it's piracy
<TheDarkAc> *not piracy
<TheDarkAc> oops
<MuzerNtbk> !rules
<IOS61> MuzerNtbk: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<TheDarkAc> xDC
<TheDarkAc> !rules
<IOS61> TheDarkAc: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<Athenon> MuzerNtbk: i have been told that the official ruling is we support emulators and that's all
<MuzerNtbk> 1. NO PIRACY (or back-ups, don't go pretending, they are the same thing)! We're happy to help with getting the latest emulator to work but you'll be kicked (or banned) if you ask where to get ROMs etc. How to install VC / WiiWare games or asking where to get them will get you an instant ban as will asking for .ISOs or asking on support for modchips or any other piracy or backup-related topics.
<MuzerNtbk> it does seem vague, you're right...
<MuzerNtbk> hmm
<Athenon> TheDarkAc: btw, owning a game doesnt make it legal to download.....roms you dump yourself are another story, however
<Athenon> MuzerNtbk: well, it's been common knowledge around here for months that the official rule is that we support emulators only
<TheDarkAc> i only have roms from games i own though... i dumped all but the first sonic game, because my cartridge is screwed on that
<MuzerNtbk> The way I thought of it is that using an emulator is far more likely to be legitimate than using backed-up Wii games or WiiWare
<Athenon> only legal roms are self-dumped ones...period ;P
<Hawkie> Espeon
<Hawkie> zzz
<Hawkie> And I'm good.
<Hawkie> x3
<TheDarkAc> yup, so i own 1 illegal rom then...
<Brother> o3o
<Espeon> good to hear
<MuzerNtbk> for example, your old console may be broken, or you may have sold it, or you might not have enough room, or the TV standard in your area might have changed and your console not support the newer one
<Athenon> MuzerNtbk: the way i think of it is using an emulator is still like 98% likely to be piracy....ive met 2 people who dump their own roms so far in my entire life ;P
<TheDarkAc> anyway
<MuzerNtbk> well, even if downloading games you own is illegal, it shouldn't really be - so I don't count it as piracy.
<Athenon> TheDarkAc: i really wish i had the equipment to dump my own roms sometimes....then again, id have to dig out all the games too xP
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<Glacymr> 12!ESPEON
*Espeon now belongs to Glacymr for 13 minutes
<Espeon> http://i28.tinypic.com/29bexqx.png this is pretty much how I feel.
<Espeon> I need sleep also.
<MuzerNtbk> yeah, I wish I had that equipment
<MuzerNtbk> would be fun
<Lugianite> 2hm
<Athenon> LOL...since when do we go on the way things SHOULD be instead of the way things ARE?
<MuzerNtbk> I could buy a retrode, that would have Mega Drive, SNES, N64 and GB covered
<Athenon> bbl i guess....idk
<Glacymr> 12hi Lugianite
<MuzerNtbk> Athenon, since the beginning AFAIK... I'm sure you could argue that the HBC and many other things we support are against the DMCA, or even its (more lenient) European equivalent
<Lugianite> 2how are you bro?
<TheDarkAc> Athenon: I didn't buy my own equipment, my IT teacher bought one on the school's money to try to show is how games are stored on cartridges and how much space is on them.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Interesting, Espy.
<Espeon> Oh
<Glacymr> 12average
<Lugianite> 2hm, a shadow o.o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hi? Ovo
<Lugianite> 2how are you? ^-^
<Espeon> Hi o3o
<TheDarkAc> his face was like a kid with a new toy when the package came.... he waited til we had him (which was that afternoon) to open it too....
<MuzerNtbk> nice
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Normal. :P
<MuzerNtbk> lucky :P
<tpw_rules> nice
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Just got a new load of work that keeps pushing my fanfic down. :|
<tpw_rules> i would dump my carts, except i'm too much of a wuss to mod my nes to do it
<Espeon> .-.
<TheDarkAc> i did a slight deal with him... he'd let me dump my games, i'd repair his laptop in half the time it would have taken for the school technicians to do it (he may have been an it teacher, but he was LAZY as hell XD)
<tpw_rules> lol
<Lugianite> 2hm
<Lugianite> 2tats not good :(
<Lugianite> 2and hi FlameLugia
<Skylands> 10Hey Flame
<Espeon> Hey Flame
<Athenon> MuzerNtbk: well, it sounds like if this is channel policy, it needs to go in the rules........currently, rules are vague to the point that every op just kinda picks what to enforce and how much
<tpw_rules> what hardwware was it?
<FlameLugia> hey ^^
<Damos> 13hey Flame
*Damos 13hugs
<tpw_rules> our school has no computer classes
<tpw_rules> it consists soley of the principal's son
<TheDarkAc> it was 3 years ago... i honestly can't remember :S sorry.
<tpw_rules> genesis games?
<tpw_rules> i could just get a retrode
<MuzerNtbk> Athenon, Yeah, I don't think it was me who wrote the rules
<tpw_rules> retrode needs to support nes
<TheDarkAc> i rememver that it was for the UK Megadrive... unfortunately, it was PAL locked
<tpw_rules> i'm too much of a wuss to install a copynes
<MuzerNtbk> though it's so long ago now I can't quite remember
<FlameLugia> hiya
<Athenon> well, either way....nobody really knows what constitutes a violation of what rule so we just kinda make crap up as we go along
<MuzerNtbk> I seem to remember I wrote a huge wall of text and someone else heavily abridged it to more or less what we have today
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<Creideiki> Hellos
<TheDarkAc> anyway, i'm gonna have to go... i've got a review to work on on my website. if you wanna have a look, the site is http://soditaltf4.co.uk
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, Creideiki.
<TheDarkAc> cya
<Athenon> maybe the unabridged copy for ops or something? idk, but its rather annoying to find out channel policy.....isnt really channel policy
<Creideiki> I have discovered a hilarious phrase book. Which if used by any one who doesn't know the languages... would result in much hilarity. :P
<Damos> 13hey Creideiki
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ovo
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Is it English as She is Spoke?
<Creideiki> No, hte Zompist Phrasebook. :P
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<tpw_rules> !rules
<IOS61> tpw_rules: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<Creideiki> "I understand your language perfectly." --> "Ich sprechen deutsch wie italienisch Fußballtrainer. " = "I speak German like an Italian soccer coach."
<Damos> 13wow
<Espeon> Italian people speaking German? Does that work well?
<WiiPower> nand backup
<IOS61> WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<WiiPower> could somebody please change the script of the bot?
<Creideiki> Another fun phrase: "Where is the Cathedral?" --> "Wo geht's 'n hier zum Puff?" = "How do I get to the brothel?"
<Creideiki> Needless to say the mistranslations are very, very intentional. :P
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<tpw_rules> the rules seem fairly sane except for 1 and 3
<MuzerNtbk> lukegb, you do it
<WiiPower> !rules
<IOS61> WiiPower: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<MuzerNtbk> 1 not sane?
<tpw_rules> no, the thing is if we back up to back when it was created, it does the same thing
<Shadow_Lugia> 6LYON
<MuzerNtbk> 3 not sane?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6D:
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Brother> Creideiki: lol, just watch when in Russian they say Dermo :P
<tpw_rules> well kind of vague
<Athenon> sane yes, clear.....far from it
<MuzerNtbk> oh I see
<MuzerNtbk> I thought you meant insane as in the rule shouldn't be there at all
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Whoo, I'm watching Wipeout for the first time in a year. O_o
<Brother> is it good?
<Brother> or boring
<tpw_rules> sane as in not clear and vague
*FlameLugia pokes brother
<Creideiki> "Impressed as I am with the New Wave in cinematography, I must say that this particular film seemed both pretentious and unsatisfying, and that the director's imagery, though compelling, is no substitute for a true cinematic message." --> "Der Film ist <bleep>." = "The movie was <bleep>."
<MuzerNtbk> http://img.worsethanfailure.com/images/200706/error'd/botanicalgarden.png
<WiiPower> would be more fun if the others would be serious
<Athenon> im offended! they dont have "his imperial majesty"
<MuzerNtbk> Athenon, don't worry, there's a scroll bar, it might be scrolled off
<Athenon> oh right
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Athenon> i was originally going to say president because its in alphabetical order ;P
<WiiPower> "Ops have the final word on what is and what isn't offtopic and offenders will be kicked and then banned"
<Athenon> WiiPower: thats off topic and you are now to be kicked and banned
<Athenon> :D
<Athenon> xD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Brother: it's funny.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Have fun with schadenfreude.
<MuzerNtbk> :P
<Austin> Athenon: thats off topic and you will now be kickbanned
<Athenon> Austin: thats off topic and you are now to be tarred and feathered
<Austin> epic
<Austin> can i fly now?
<tpw_rules> no
<Athenon> no, but you can be burned
<tpw_rules> they're speical feathers formulated specially to disable flying
<tpw_rules> special*

<KBK> If someone cares to pass on a message, WiiPower gave me some advice about installing updated shop channels without messing up homebrew, and how to backkup my system to protect myself. I followed the instructions and everything ran perfectly with no problems. Just wanted to say thanks
<Athenon> KBK: alright, we'll be sure to ban him promptly
<Lugianite> 2wb Sheena
<Athenon> KBK: joking ;P
<Aurora> 6...wow
<KBK> Ahah
<Aurora> 6I've really grown to my mac
<Lyon> 04lol
<KBK> I was about to say "I read the rules, it was within the allowed content"
<Aurora> 6I completely forgot how to close firefox lol
*Aurora 6went to close it the mac way
<Brother> is that a good thing or a bad thing? :P
<Lyon> 04loooool
<Lyon> 04Command + Q
<Aurora> 6well, I can't go to the top left corner of the screen and click firefox > close
<Aurora> 6I need to go to the right
<Lyon> 04Roara
<Aurora> 6or command Q
<Lyon> 04yeah
<Lyon> 04I was gonna say that
<Aurora> 6but my mind at least understood that comand Q isn't on a PC
<Aurora> 6so, I half recognized it as a PC, not a mac
<Lyon> 04lol
<Altair> same thing happened to me
<Altair> with copy and paste shortcuts
<Aurora> 6my biggest issue
<Aurora> 6I try to Ctrl+z irl all the time
<Gandalph> lol
<Altair> lol
<Aurora> 6if I could have ONE computer command irl, that would be it
<Lugianite> 2I wish that worked
<Aurora> 6Aurora said something stupid *ctrl+z* Aurora said something smart
<Aurora> 6instant perfection
<Altair> if ctrl+C and crtl+V came together
<Altair> i'd like those :D
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Aurora> 6ctrl+f would be nice
<Altair> $100 + $100
<Altair> :D
<Lugianite> 2I would use it to backtrack my life to spend more time with my grandpa before that day
<Aurora> 6opening a dictionary, not spending 5 minutes trying to find the word on the page
<Altair> oh yes find would be awesome
*Aurora 6is easily distracted by other words
*Altair is easily distracted in general
<Aurora> 6 20:20	Altair	if ctrl+C and crtl+V came together
<Aurora> 6 20:20	Altair	$100 + $100
<Aurora> 6lol
*Brother distracts Altair :O
<Aurora> 6I was thinking more of a ctrl+c the answers to a test
<Aurora> 6but that works too
<Altair> :P
<Aurora> 6and then when life gets too out of control
<Aurora> 6ctrl+alt+delete
<bojangels> is anyone on
*Altair nickalerts :S
<bojangels> i have a question
*Aurora 6presses alt again

*Altair has peformed an illegal operation
<Altair> lol i just noticed
<Altair> in os x
<Lyon> 04(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)
<Altair> windows-based servers show up as a old white monitor displaying BSOD
*Lyon flees
<Altair> irchan maybe
<Creideiki> Heh... some noob just tripped the Resume Button at a place I know.
<Altair> o.o
<Creideiki> Resume Button = Should have an acute accent on the last e... because that button causes 04MASSIVE DOWNTIME. :P
<Glacymr> 12wild eXAKR is alive :D
<Creideiki> (As in... fires a non-conducting bolt into the main power lines... and triggers the fire suppression system.)
<bojangels> does anyone know how to work the NOMP?
<Creideiki> (So: *thunk* Beep. ... Beep. ... Beep. *WHOOOOOSSSSSHHHHH* "I am so fired aren't I?")
<Altair> xD
<Altair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWCVhGzrAT0
<Altair> i am very disappoint
<Brother> Altair: take over teh world then
<eXAKR> rbr
<|Shadow|> bojangels, what is NOMP?
<viince> NOMP (NZB-O-MATIC PLUS)
<viince> it's a stripped down news client...do you not understand step 1 ?
<viince> there are better clients
<XpertXP> is there a working inject of Star Wars Shadows of the Empire?
<XpertXP> i have an urge to play that game
<dlukz> viince, where have you seen dmca's hitting NG's?
<viince> haven't seen, just heard
<dlukz> from who?
<viince> ne1
<viince> whoever
<viince> when it disappears from all servers...what other conclusion do you reach ?
<Theguesst> Evening all
<dlukz> who said something disappeared from all servers?
<Theguesst> More silence. Just what u expected.
<Theguesst> I*
<viince> idk, some peeps complained about it...
<jwash> has anyone seen a wiiside configurator for cfg loader?
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<viince> Idk if it was removed from ALL...or not
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<drfsupercenter> 03I upgraded my phone to Android 2.2
<viince> no jwash
<drfsupercenter> 03works pretty well, though surprisingly not that many apps support moving to the SD card yet :/
<Theguesst> Nice
<Theguesst> How slow does it run :p
<Theguesst> Ji
<Theguesst> Jk*
<drfsupercenter> 03same speed as 2.1/
<dlukz> <lbiza> so wtf is there no links to mario galaxy 2
<dlukz> <lbiza> incomp crap on ng
<dlukz> <viince> dmca takedowns ? what server are you using ?
<dlukz> <jc23> dmca takedowns ?
<drfsupercenter> 03why would it be slower
<drfsupercenter> 03I just need to configure Autoruns again
<dlukz> <lbiza> how the hell did dmca get ahold of ng
<drfsupercenter> 03becuase I have like over 9000 things that run whenever I Make a call >_>
<dlukz> it sounds like you said DMCA first
<viince> ng's have dmca compliance
<dlukz> and got everyone freaked out
<dlukz> viince...really
<Theguesst> 600mhz processors aren't as slow as they appear, I guess
<viince> read giganews dmca compliance
<Theguesst> My own personal bottom line would be 1 ghz, but you've changed my mind
<dlukz> considering most news hosts keep servers outside of the US, where dmca's mean shit
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<dlukz> giganews != most
<viince> true
<drfsupercenter> 031GHz is only in like one phone
<drfsupercenter> 03AFAIK
<drfsupercenter> 03I can overclock mine to 900MHz
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't
<drfsupercenter> 03because that wastes battery
<drfsupercenter> 03though meh
<drfsupercenter> 03the one thing that bugs me
<Theguesst> No, it's on about 3 others now
<jwash> what about a way to upload the config.txt without pulling the sd card?
<drfsupercenter> 03(and this may just be because it's not final yet)
<viince> giganews == biggest
<drfsupercenter> 03there's no longer a totally silent mode
<drfsupercenter> 03the "sound off" is now the same as "vibrate"
<Theguesst> The new AT&T galaxy s
<drfsupercenter> 03so it will still vibrate...
<viince> ftpii ?
<drfsupercenter> 03I like dthe ability to turn *everything* off
<dlukz> giganews == most expensive
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 032.2 isn't even out for real on the Droid
<Theguesst> It has a samsung 1ghz chip that's faster than an a4 in the iPad
<drfsupercenter> 03I used my rooted access to install a custom ROM
<viince> giganews != cheapest
<drfsupercenter> 03spent like 4 hours putting all my stuff back
<drfsupercenter> 03as it got erased obviously
<viince> giganews > most
<dlukz> i think that guy is just having issues finding a good copy of SMG2
<Theguesst> I do that every month or so because my hardware sucks :p
<Theguesst> On my touch
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03well I don't
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<viince> could be
<Theguesst> And for that I envy you
<Theguesst> But what am I to do
<drfsupercenter> 03"append SMS" doesn't actually append
<drfsupercenter> 03here's the thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I backed up my text messages before I upgraded
<viince> but that's still not the 1st time I've heard the complaint
<drfsupercenter> 03then when they got erased
<drfsupercenter> 03I left it alone
<drfsupercenter> 03now I have another 50 or so
<Theguesst> Can't afford android until I get a job. Even then I will have more things to pay for like a car and my gaming hobbies
<drfsupercenter> 03so what to do...
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL gaming hobies
<Brother> watch poker? o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03you could just start pirating
*drfsupercenter hides
<Theguesst> How about NO
<dlukz> they can be compliant, but if they were truely acting on it, a lot more would be removed
<dlukz> not just SMG2
<drfsupercenter> 03fine, go broke
<drfsupercenter> 03if I could afford to buy everything I use, I would
<dlukz> TONS of stuff would
<drfsupercenter> 03most people pirate due to insane high prices
<Theguesst> I also want to get deeper into anime, but that would cost a fortune
<Theguesst> Plus card games
<viince> it seems like other articles have been removed at times...not Just that...but not TONs either
<drfsupercenter> 03how so
<drfsupercenter> 03most anime isn't even sold in America
<drfsupercenter> 03so you HAVE to pirate it
<drfsupercenter> 03like fansubs and the like
<dlukz> such as?
<viince> movies
<dlukz> cause things disappearing could be a bad hdd on the server
<Theguesst> I realize that
<dlukz> or other things
<Theguesst> And that's why I'm not too deep into it
<viince> yeah, but I don't think the servers will advertise any dmca takedown actions
<Theguesst> As I was saying, I also want to start collecting another set of cards
<[SR]> lol they are disappearing off usenet servers cause they are taking them off
<dlukz> they would
<dlukz> especially when they advertise 99.9% completion
<[SR]> smb2 .. lots of hbo shows are taken off giganews
<Theguesst> The trading card arc right now is pokemon, yugioh, and magic
<Theguesst> I have pokemon and I picked up a quite outdated magic deck at a thrift store
<Theguesst> I'm sure it sucks by now
<dlukz> 99%+ completion rate
<Theguesst> But I could always get the card game video game on steam and play that instead.
<Theguesst> Not so with yugioh
<dlukz> that means..if they got DMCA's for tons of shit, and they hid it, they're completion rate would be a lot lower
<Runix> hmm
<Theguesst> Yugioh is cheap
<Theguesst> And that could be what influences my final decision.
<[SR]> their completion rate is still the same
<[SR]> whether they delete something or not
<dlukz> not if they remove stuff from dmca complaints
<[SR]> yes even cause of that
<dlukz> that means they don't have that article for their customers
<dlukz> which means, their server isn't COMPLETE
<[SR]> there server is complete
<[SR]> cause that post doesnt exist on their servers
<[SR]> because it was deleted
<Theguesst> As for gaming, I can control myself
<Theguesst> I don't need any games right now
<[SR]> their servers are still complete
<Theguesst> I have many major games
<dlukz> [SR], this is going nowhere
<[SR]> doesnt matter cause i'm right
<viince> semantics
<dlukz> http://www.newzgroups.com/_newsgroup-completion.asp
<dlukz> So, if all the "parts" are available for downloading, then the binary is 100% complete.
<[SR]> yah and all their parts are complete
<dlukz> if they remove a full 5gb post
<dlukz> that isn't complete
<[SR]> so if they remove 500gigs .. all their parts are still complete
<LiThIuMx> that has fuck all to do with being complete
<LiThIuMx> complete means 100% of the fuckn thing
<LiThIuMx> not 80
<LiThIuMx> 90
<LiThIuMx> or 73
<LiThIuMx> so not hvaing it all doesnt mean shit
<dlukz> which means, their server isn't complete in their postings
<LiThIuMx> ur an idiot
<drfsupercenter> 03btw, I found a thing that proves that the record labels do nothing but steal money from artists
<[SR]> actually that means their server is complete in their postings
<drfsupercenter> 03yet proving why I'mn not the least bit bothered to pirate music
<[SR]> because the post in question doesnt exist to begin with
<LiThIuMx> exactly
<LiThIuMx> how does giga not having it make them incomplete?
<[SR]> i guess sometimes logic is tough to instill in people
<Theguesst> The only things I'm worried about is other m and skyward sword
<Theguesst> Other m is coming in a month and a half so I might have to sell some loose ends in my collection to afford it
<Theguesst> ... Yeah I must by psyco since I'm talking to myself
<Theguesst> Oh yeah
<Theguesst> I have about 10 albums I want to purchase
<Theguesst> But music is the most pirated digital content available
<LiThIuMx> must be
<Theguesst> Cube...
*Theguesst throws a cynical bucket of cubes at cube
<Theguesst> Cylindrical*
<Theguesst> So yeah
<Theguesst> Bottom line, I need a job
<BatistaLT> !rules
<IOS61> BatistaLT: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<LiThIuMx> guess he felt defeated
<Tarawa> so how do we know for sure about this deleting thing?
<Tarawa> I dont really weant to swap usenet prioviders if I dont have to
<LiThIuMx> i read it somewhere
<LiThIuMx> hbo stuff has been removed
<LiThIuMx> giga is over priced shit anyway
<LiThIuMx> get newshosting
<[SR]> giga is way over priced
<[SR]> i share newshosting with my buddy .. was $100 for 2 years
<LiThIuMx> newshosting is 14 a month
<LiThIuMx> unlimited ips
<Tarawa> they are, but I've been with them for years with no complaints
<LiThIuMx> connections

<Tarawa> is newshosting being targeted by the deletions?
<[SR]> years of giganews?
<[SR]> that sucks
<LiThIuMx> ya man
<LiThIuMx> get newshosting
<LiThIuMx> and share the account with a friend
<Tarawa> I have 2 internets so, a 2nd IP would be handy
<[SR]> so do i
<[SR]> cable and dsl
<LiThIuMx> do dual wan
<LiThIuMx> i got 3 cables modems
<LiThIuMx> lol
<[SR]> only 60gig cap on the cable here

<LiThIuMx> then why do u have a cao?
<LiThIuMx> cap
<[SR]> i get 1Tb a month off the dsl anyways
<LiThIuMx> take forever
<[SR]> got 700+ hours a month no worries

<KarateBob> wtf
<[SR]> i do
<KarateBob> you cant get 1tb with 5mbit, can you?
<[SR]> Yah
<LiThIuMx> it would take 700 hours
<[SR]> yep ..
<KarateBob> 29 days
<KarateBob> lol
<Tarawa> I dont see it advertised having multiple IPs on newshosting
<[SR]> 1.28 is the max or so
<LiThIuMx> tarawa it wont
<[SR]> lol they dont advertise it
<LiThIuMx> just trust me
<LiThIuMx> it works
<KarateBob> newshosting and uns dont block it
<[SR]> yah hey come here so we can lose money
<[SR]> but as of about 2 months ago i get max of 3 IPs on newshosting .. which sucks balls
<LiThIuMx> hah
<LiThIuMx> i use 3 every time i download
<LiThIuMx> and i know atleast 5 others use this account 24/7
<[SR]> oh i know it was like that when we first signed up .. but i swear as of 2 months ago i get that error all the time
<LiThIuMx> u gotta sue euro server
<[SR]> cant exactly email and be like hey why cant i rip off your company anymore :)
<[SR]> now that i never tried
<LiThIuMx> and port 7000

<eXAKR> OK, let's try fixing up this !eXAKR script again
<eXAKR> Espeon care to pass me the variables?
<Espeon> mkay
<Jamiev2> need some help plz
<Jamiev2> my bro installed 4.3 without me knowing
<Zer0900> hi, anyone know why a wii would suddenly stop loading discs and give a black screen and just hang there
<Jamiev2> how can i install hbc
<Jamiev2> ?
<FuZZBaLL> it's broken?
<FuZZBaLL> :D
<Jamiev2> anyone?
<lukegb> You can't. Yet.
<lukegb> Wait for the new Hackmii Installer
<Jamiev2> ok
<lukegb> You'll need to use smash stack or indiana pwns.
<Jamiev2> do you know how long that will be?
<Jamiev2> smash stack?
<lukegb> !wb Smash Stack
<IOS61> Smash Stack: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Smash_Stack
<IOS61> Smash Stack is an exploit from Comex that uses a flaw in the custom stages in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (NTSC) to load unauthorized code on the Wii. It was released on August 20, 2009. It works for all System Menu versions.
<lukegb> !wb Indiana Pwns
<IOS61> Indiana Pwns: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Indiana_Pwns
<IOS61> The Indiana Pwns is a safe way to enable homebrew on a Wii without hardware modification. The Indiana Pwns is achieved by playing a hacked game save for LEGO Indiana Jones which executes a homebrew application from an external SD card. Examples of such homebrew .elf or .dol files can be found on the List of homebrew applications|Homebrew applications page. The Indiana Pwns was created by Team Twiizers.
<lukegb> Smash Stack is NTSC Smash Bros only
<lukegb> Indiana Pwns is PAL/NTSC Indiana Jones
<Jamiev2> im in uk so i only have ssbb pal
<Jamiev2> and dont have indiana jone
<Jamiev2> will it work with the pal version? or has it been confirmed not to work
<^Wulfgar^> Zer0900, is your wii chipped or softmodded?
<Zer0900> softmod
<Zer0900> ultimate softmod 4.1
<^Wulfgar^> did you update anything? how are you loading your discs?
<Zer0900> just burnin them and putting them into wii
<Zer0900> nah, didnt do any updates ever
<DefiantN> perhaps the laser burnt out
<Dami0N> Zer0900 on power on it still give black screen ?
<^Wulfgar^> you need to use a 'loader' to play backups if you're softmodded...unless you installed that shitty cioscorp
<Dykam> Jamiev2, probably not, as lukegb said "ntsc sb only"
<MuzerNtbk> Jamiev2, it won't work at the moment
<MuzerNtbk> there's a possibility someone will make a PAL version, but it is unlikely
<Jamiev2> hmm
<Zer0900> Dami0N, nah, only when i click on the game to launch it, gives a black screen
<Jamiev2> does anyone know how long it takes for hackmii to release a new installer usually??
<Zer0900> ^Wulfgar^, I beleive I did use that, now the homebrew channel wants to update but complains about a bad ios
<MuzerNtbk> usually anywhere between a few days and a few months, depending on how much they have to do
<Jamiev2> oh right lol, so not really a rough time but oh well
<Jamiev2> i only got the update cause my bro did it ¬_¬, just as i was gonna reinstall hbc
<MuzerNtbk> ah
<Jamiev2> went to install it got error 4, i was like WTF then saw i was on 4.3E
<MuzerNtbk> :(
<Jamiev2> yea
<^Wulfgar^> cioscorp is the worst piece of shit ever...surprised you didn't brick when you installed it
<eXAKR> !!!
<eXAKR> I just found a complete system backup of my computer before I sent it in for repair stashed in my external hard drive
<eXAKR> Which includes...
<Dami0N> ah then your softmod is fucked by an upgrade
<Jamiev2> Well I'm gonna go for now
<eXAKR> EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I LOST FOREVER
<eXAKR> INCLUDING THE WALLPAPER COLLECTION
<Jamiev2> Thanks for the help, and see you all later =)
<^Wulfgar^> no...he's using cioscorp
<^Wulfgar^> get rid of that shit and use neogamma...or better yet, get a usb hdd

<Athenon> is the computer on a network that requires a network login?
<Sonic41-> Like a secure network? Then yah
<SparkART> 2hi Arti~
<SparkART> 2... so it DID split
<Athenon> like a network where you have to login with your own username and password to be allowed on the network
<Sonic41-> I have a guest account on it, but it logs in just fine
<Arti|mobile> I don't suppose anyone has seen Lugia have they?
<Athenon> like a university network, company network, etc
<Athenon> personal networks are very unlikely to have it
<Arti|mobile> don't worry, JUST got a text
<Sonic41-> okay, then no
<Athenon> ok. have you googled the problem?
<zc00gii> I got KLined on freenode -___-
<Kyu> 4SPLIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
<TimeShift> now that's a split...
<Athenon> LOL ive never gotten klined on freenode
<zc00gii> Athenon: I got klined for no reason
<Athenon> could be that they did a too-wide kline
<Athenon> or it could be some server staff being dumb
<Athenon> just connect to a different server
<Icydragon> Gerpie.....
<zc00gii> probably the latter
<zc00gii> no no

<zc00gii> ahh
<zc00gii> we have like, 8
<Curly> :O
*Curly puts an icepack on the bruises
<Athenon> weve been proposed links before, but we turn them down primarily due to not meshing with our admin model
<zc00gii> *** opal.ninthbit.net 270 zc00gii 8 servers and 36 users, average 4.50 users per server
<Athenon> we as in my staff turn it down too...not just me being an ass xP
<Athenon> in fact, usually on votes i abstain unless theres a tie to break

<Athenon> ahh yeah
<Athenon> i dont know if i have that much uptime or not because i rebooted recently
*Andres forgots to take teh Andrespic D:
<Athenon> before that, uptime was like...months

<Reshiram> 6Immature, yes. 3rd grader, no ;)
<drf|work> Seriously, the more jewelry people wear, the less hot they look
<drf|work> inb4 that's your intention
*drf|work hides
<Reshiram> 6I hate jewelry
<kanshin> @find teen
*Stitch goes to fix referraladm.
<drf|work> earrings = jewelry
<Reshiram> 6except earrings
<FlameLugia> i know, usually the ones who wear tons of makeup are the ones who r hot without it xD
<Obsi> Hiya~
<Curly> I just wish it wasn't so cold I need a sweater >.>
<FlameLugia> on a side note
<Reshiram> 6I think earrings are nice, they're not in-your-face like most jewelry
<FlameLugia> that was a response to why dont they go as they are or something
<Reshiram> 6unless I have chandeliers hanging from them
<Reshiram> 6but that's why I avoid big ones
<FlameLugia> that would be epic
<Perseid> lol
<FlameLugia> jk
*Andres wraps himself around the Curly, providing her with warms!
<|lucid|> he found something but it wasnt a teen
<drf|work> Reshiram	but that's why I avoid big ones <-- you know how wrong that sounded?
<drf|work> also that makes you unlike most girls
*drf|work hides
<FlameLugia> LOOOOOOOOL
<bb-q> but his next movie I think he is a CEO that goes mental and talks to hand puppets
*Curly curls up under the Andres wrappings and falls asleep
<FlameLugia> EWWW PERVERTS
<drf|work> LOL
<bb-q> so I say it kinda fits
<drf|work> I'm not a perv, I'm just gutterminded :P
<Obsi> LOLOL
<Curly> really in need of a nap. I fell asleep on my patio for a while >.>
<FlameLugia> i like it :D
<FlameLugia> o_O
<FlameLugia> i meant its funny, i dont like men
<Reshiram> 6see, those thoughts don't even cross my mind until drf points them out
<Andres> Nap then :o
<Reshiram> 6:|
<FlameLugia> brb
<J-Lugia> and that's why I tend to ignore drf :D
<Curly> but if I nap I won't get up until like 11pm and I'm waiting for someone to come online :I
<Andres> D:
<Andres> k.
<Andres> No naps then!
<drf|work> LOL
<Curly> that's the idea x.X
<Articuno> 12Hi Reshiram ^^
*Andres huggles the Curly then!
*Curly huggles
*Stitch should be done.
<FlameLugia> but drf is epic
<Stitch> Though I'm guessing Spyrorocks will find at least one hole.
<drf|work> indeed
<drf|work> XD
<FlameLugia> EWWW EGOTISTICAL
*Reshiram 6steps on Arti
<Obsi> drf you're a perv through and through
*Obsi pounces Arti~

<yuyuyup> new beavis & butthead tv confirmed
<bb-q> ok paste all that in the chan I wanted it to be in
<FlameLugia> i totally just stole your catch phrase drf
<drf|work> EWW is not my catchphrase
*Obsi steals one of Arti's molted feathers and rigs it up as a pen :D
<drf|work> I stole it from someone else after all
<FlameLugia> yay well its mine now
<Obsi> Okay then what would be mine if any?
<Reshiram> 6PEAS
<Reshiram> 6and ow, my RSI is acting up
<drf|work> fail
*drf|work is somehow immune to RSI
<Spyrorocks> Hope not.
<FlameLugia> same
<FlameLugia> atleast for now
<drf|work> O_O
<drf|work> http://geocities.ws/drfsupercenter/ <-- a site that archived Geocities!
<FlameLugia> what o_o
<Biotin> |Shadow|, are you around?
<drf|work> I mean, they stopped doing free hosting a while ago
<drf|work> hence why I have www.drfsupercenter.com
<drf|work> but I used to use their hosting
<Corevette789> In what
<FlameLugia> im not clicking it, it has ur name D:
<Stitch> My coding.
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> my website is cool D:
<FlameLugia> its perverted and stuff isnt it D:
<drf|work> nope.
<drf|work> it just has music and some things
<Articuno> 12Geocities still exists..?
<drf|work> http://www.drfsupercenter.com/MIDI/Around%20the%20World%20%28Jazzy%29.mid
<drf|work> No.
<drf|work> look at the domain
<Articuno> 12EW AUTOPLAYING MUSIC
<drf|work> that site *mirrored* it
<drf|work> >_>
<Articuno> 12Oh I see
<Obsi> Is that.... omg... omg can't look away
<drf|work> My autoplaying music is awesome
<drf|work> and you know it
<Corevette789> For?
<Articuno> 12It is awesome but still, I didn't ask it to play....
<Obsi> Danny: What autoplaying music :)
<drf|work> http://geocities.ws/drfsupercenter/
<drf|work> see for yourself
<Stitch> The new referral system
*Articuno slaps DRF..
<Articuno> 12You didn't get it
<Obsi> I love noscript
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I hate noscript
<drf|work> I prefer Ad Muncher
<Stitch> Basically, you get points for referring people here, and you can redeem those points for perks on the network.
<Articuno> 12Admuncher for the win
<drf|work> Arti, I know autoplaying music can be annoying but the song I have on my page is just frickinga wesome
<Obsi> Oh, and 90% of my browsing is in elinks, so no annoying javascript even without an ad blocker :)
<drf|work> and most people end up liking it anyway XD
<Obsi> What song is it Danny?
<drf|work> I *like* javascript
<drf|work> um
<Corevette789> Sweet
<drf|work> a MIDI I stole from Windows 95
*drf|work runs
<drf|work> original filename bluesy2.mid
<|lucid|> its called king of the hill
<drf|work> not sure what it was, I just called it Blues
<drf|work> but it works well
<drf|work> as BGM
<NEO_X> ? softmod
<Reshiram> 6http://www.demotivate.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/lazy-demotivational-poster.jpg something about that made me laugh out loud
<Obsi> Did it come from the C:\windows\media directory?
<Obsi> And can you tell me the md5sum of the song? If so I can tell you which it was likely to be
<drf|work> No idea Obsi
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|work> A friend gave it to me
<drf|work> on a floppy disk
<drf|work> back in the day
<drf|work> http://www.drfsupercenter.com/MIDI/Blues.mid
<drf|work> there, do w/e you want with it
<Obsi> ... I recognize that branch
<drf|work> I can't md5 on here
<Obsi> I recognize that lazy curve
<Obsi> What the hades kinda crippled system do you have that you can't do something as basic as MD5?
<yuyuyup> there aint gonna be new KOTH
<yuyuyup> just B&B
<drf|work> Windows XP?
<drf|work> I don't feel like installing software
<drf|work> and I don't think it's built in?
<Obsi> Yup, that $300 crippleware.
*Stitch waits for a flaw to be found.
<Obsi> But at least isn't Vista.
<drf|work> LOL
*Obsi RUNS
<drf|work> XD
<drf|work> I didn't buy it..
<drf|work> this is a work computer
<drf|work> I quite like Windows 7
<drf|work> I really had no problem with XP either, it works fine... you just need third party software to do some things and I'm alzy
<drf|work> *lazy
<Obsi> For a Windows based system I quite like 7 too
<yuyuyup> dude
<yuyuyup> what the fuck
<yuyuyup> you can't be serious
<drf|work> I have no problem with Linux, just that I'm an A/V nerd and you just can't do decent video editing on it
<drf|work> or games
<yuyuyup> the ps3 move uses THE ORIGINAL PLAYSTATION 2 EYE ?
<drf|work> or much of anything besides like pro hacking
<Obsi> You need third-party software to do even basic things like checksums, programming, editing anything, or compiling anything.
<yuyuyup> or is it a ps3 eye
<yuyuyup> http://us.playstation.com/ps3/accessories/scph-98047.html
<yuyuyup> what other ps3 games use a ps3 eye
<Perseid> That's the PS3 one.
<Perseid> The PS2 one was the Eyetoy.
<yuyuyup> ah
<yuyuyup> how come you can buy the eye seperately
<Perseid> It's been out since the PS3 has.
<yuyuyup> separately
<Perseid> Eye of Judgement used it.
<yuyuyup> musta slipped my mind
<bb-q> its gonna fail big time
<bb-q> same with kinect
<yuyuyup> I'm just delirious w/ excitement over the return of Beavis & Butthead
<bb-q> is this one scripted after your life as well?
<yuyuyup> only my childhood
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<SparkART> 2o3o
<Perseid> The psychic in me says we'll see new systems for 2012. Natal/Move will be given a chance for a year then after it fails hard they'll scramble to release new systems.
*drf|work dies
<drf|work> anyway Obsi, does that MIDI help you any?
<drf|work> all I know is it came from Windows 95
<drf|work> and was named bluesy2.mid
<yuyuyup> I predict ms will ditch the notion of no controller and just utilize the controller with motion games
*FlameLugia pokes spawky
<yuyuyup> or make a 1 handed controller
<drf|work> http://www.drfsupercenter.com/MIDI/Around%20the%20World%20%28Jazzy%29.mid <-- The most awesome thing in the world, btw
<bb-q> by then WIIHD will be out
<drf|work> I know some people don't like MIDIs, but that is seriously amazing
<yuyuyup> cause you can't fucking accel/brake without somethin
<yuyuyup> how the hell you gonna sell kinect to forza fans
<Reshiram> 6what is that o-o
<Reshiram> 6that sounds pretty darn awesome
<drf|work> exactly
<drf|work> it's a jazzy remix of ATC - Around the World
<drf|work> in MIDI form
<yuyuyup> ms smoking meth from a dirty lightbulb
<Reshiram> 6MIDI is what now?
<drf|work> which I now have stuck in my head
<drf|work> basically, instruments
*Reshiram 6probably knows, but not by name
<bb-q> you what irks me about the whole kinect shit for the 360, is that they can spend millions developing that stupid shit but they cant make a light gun?
<Reshiram> 6ah
<drf|work> you can open it up and make sheet music of it
<drf|work> ask Quany, she does MIDI stuff a lo0t
<drf|work> *lot
<yuyuyup> who cares wii is numero uno on-rails shooter system
<Reshiram> 6lo0t lol
<bb-q> in 480
<Perseid> Oh, but you don't need guns anymore. Controllers are so 2005, donchano?
<yuyuyup> Gunblade NY & LA Machineguns coming to wii
<yuyuyup> but I guess it was delayed
<Perseid> So WTF is with a Time Crisis for Move but no Time Crisis for Wii after all these years?
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, anything?
<Obsi> Danny: I downloaded it, but I don't recognize it.
<Spyrorocks> ll check later
<yuyuyup> I just want new point blank
<bb-q> a simple light gun for the 360 would destroy the PS3
<drf|work> hm
<Spyrorocks> im not in the mood right now.
<yuyuyup> point blank ds was the shit
<drf|work> well i know it came with Windows 95
<Sneas> 03hi
<drf|work> when I get home I might try using VMWare or something
<Obsi> Noteworty Composer is a good one if you can find a working serial
<drf|work> do a F3 and type in *.mid

*Curly settles back into staring at the screen

<drf|work> the only thing I disagree with is that video production should be as high on Windows as OSX >_>
<drf|work> "Bleh, one of the worst experiences of my life was video editing on OS X. Mac advertises that it doesnâ€™t get those â€œcryptic, unintelligible error messagesâ€ that Windows gets â€“ itâ€™s true, it just locks up and doesnâ€™t doâ€¦ anything. " <-- ahaha
<drf|work> I have used OSX to edit video, also, and I find iMovie and FinalCut much more user-friendly than Movie Maker. Of course, I didnâ€™t spend as much time on Movie Maker because it isnâ€™t capable of nearly as much as FunalCut, which I had grown accustomed to. <-- that guy is an idiot
<drf|work> who the frick uses WMM
<drf|work> ever
*drf|work hands people a free pirated copy of Corel Video Studio X3
<poof> I had to use some Corel programs for school and hated them
<drf|work> VideoStudio is quite awesome though
<poof> they were for image editing, the only reason I wouldn't have preferred paint was because paint didn't have the necessary visual filters and/or vector drawing
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I m ean Corel Video Studio
<drf|work> is pretty awesome
<FlameLugia> i use WMM
<drf|work> EW
<FlameLugia> i h8 it
<drf|work> then don't use it
<FlameLugia> but its all ive got
<BATMAN123> i wanna just ask what the exact steps to play games from usb
<poof> tbh I'd just go looking for some other program rather than take the risk, even if CVS is apparently good
<drf|work> I have yet to use something better
<drf|work> Adobe Premiere is just plain crap, and I never did get the hang of Sony Vegas
<poof> and I have already had a crap experience with Corel and would rather not possibly go through it again. 8)
<Spyrorocks> when I start a roject I usually write a quick database class.
*Stitch is new to PHP.
<Obsi> The last Corel product I used was Wordperfect 8 XD
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> my mom and sisters love WordPerfect 8
<drf|work> I personally prefer Word 2000

<Airwolve> because you're a dorf
<Brother> Espeon: in the end darwin wins? :P
<drf|work> prove it
<Espeon> no, it's like "Explain Pokemon to me?" and then one of the kids says "Cockfighting meets darwin" then the last panel is torchic fighting darwin and the text "awesome" or something
<Brother> yeah Darwin wins in the end :P
<RennyC> Is it safe to install GameCube Backup Launcher 0.2 on a 4.2 wii?
<|Shadow|> yes
<|Shadow|> LOL
<|Shadow|> such a stupid question
<|Shadow|> u can use this one intigrates into the disc channel
<|Shadow|> http://www.sendspace.com/file/xn6s2j
<Stitch> 8 mins.
<|lucid|> |Shadow| you ever play 360 games?
<|Shadow|> LOL
<|lucid|> i know i am funny but it wasnt a joke
<Spyrorocks> damnit
<Spyrorocks> im getting errors now after changing my resolution
<Stitch> Errors?

<Stitch> Ooh.

<yuyuyup> is gears of war 2 on pc
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, ready?
<^Wulfgar^> google it FFS
<Perseid> no its not
<|Shadow|> yuyuyup, buy a 360 and the game
<Perseid> It's funny, too, because now Epic is saying PC gaming is going to make a comeback.
<|Shadow|> LOL
<|Shadow|> pc gaming will neve come back becaise it cost so much
<|Shadow|> when u can just get said sonsole and said game thats it
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, *poke*
<Perseid> Their reasoning was that there's going to be too much time between consoles and PC technology already destroys both consoles. As soon as more people get PC that exceed the abilities of the 360/PS3 console sales will drop.
<Sneas> 03!lag
<|lucid|> PCs that can handle the graphics are expensive
*Andres is way toooo hot.
<|lucid|> gears of war 2 on the 360 was fun though
<Proto> Hey Andres
<Andres> Because of the temperature inside the house that is, not due to attractiveness.
<Andres> Hi.
<Aurora> wheee photoshop code got mailed
<Ice> for 99.99, you get 1 game [Sports Champions], 1 MOVE controller [No sub-controller, or 2nd MOVE, especially since some games in Sports Champions require 2 MOVES, or a Sub-controller + 1 MOVE], and the Eye Toy <---
<Ice> Okay are you SURE that's not a phail?
<paranoidi> Evening, I'd like to run SMG2 (PAL, from disc), I haven't used wii a lot .. I have wiikey and it would like to perform 4.2 update (I have 3.2E). I have homebrew channel & usbloader. What is easiest way to prevent firmware upgrade?
<|Shadow|> <|lucid|> PCs that can handle the graphics are expensive <-so true my point exactly
<Ice> ..
<Ice> crud
<Ice> wrong room
<|lucid|> i know, i spent $500 and the thing would barely run COD WAW
<|Shadow|> dont go to 4.2
<|Shadow|> ? softmod
<|Shadow|> paranoidi, http://tinyurl.com/wii3141
<Ice> wait, don't you need to update every so often though?
<Ice> because the wiishop won't let you go there sometimes without an update
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, you there?
<|Shadow|> Ice, sit down before u hurt yourself
<paranoidi> |Shadow|: ugghh, seems rather complicated
<paranoidi> if I just use SafeUpdate to go 4.2 will SMG2 stop asking firmware update ("full update" which I assume causes me only troubles)
<Articuno> 12Hm
<Articuno> 12?
<Articuno> 12Whats that?
<|lucid|> why are you updating to 4.2 anyway?
<|lucid|> are you running it off a disc?
<paranoidi> yeah, well, I guess I could run it from USB if I had my 16GB stick here ;P
<Stitch> Spyrorocks Spyrorocks Spyrorocks XD
<TimeShift> congrats Roara

<Proto> no
<Stitch> Aw.
<Proto> Don't have UrT
<paranoidi> I have no good idea what IOSes are or what version I have
<^Wulfgar^> priiloader...block updates, job done
<|Shadow|> just follow that guide
<paranoidi> ^Wulfgar^: works on 3.2E? I think I saw somewhere warnings about it ;P
<|Shadow|> and rip the chip out
<|Shadow|> done
<^Wulfgar^> paranoidi, follow the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Aurora, I saw a car on the way home that said "AURORA" on the back

<Roleplay4life> 5But it's wonderful when you don't want to go outside and march. 8DD
<RennyC> Shadow: Sorry for the newbie question but I just bought my wii, it's 4.2U with the newer DVD drive (meaning no disc playing on backups :( )

<RennyC> Guess I'm fucked for GC-playing.
<Nick> since when did ur lugia drawings NOT look like lugia? xD
<Roleplay4life> 5Worlds of Fun is in Kansas City. It's SOOO MUCH FUN. <3
<RennyC> Unless I buy it heh
<Articuno> 12Well
<Roleplay4life> 5And ditto on what Nick said, Arti, LOL.
<Aeroslash> your Lugia drawings do look like proper Lugia, Arti o.o
<Nick> also did you see my finished Lucario pic?
*sally pokes strykers hat
<Aeroslash> <late>
<Nick> anyone else for that fact?
<Articuno> 12I did yeh XD still need to comment
*Proto steals Stryker's hat
<Articuno> 12and I'm picky with my Lugia pictures, usually if the face isn't perfect, it doesn't look "official" to me

<Stryker> Not my hat.
*Aristeo pounces sally and Stryker and hugs them in a group
<Articuno> 12and I realised there was something wrong with the eyes in most of my recent pictures which were making it look less Lugia like

<Nick> arti they seem fine to me heh

<Articuno> 12But I have no trobule with the fins anymore, and think I just corrected all my Lugia face issues

<Andres> It is easy to find huggles!
*Proto pushes Aristeo
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't think any artist is ever 100% pleased with a piece of theirs. It's.. I dunno, creative nature or something. The human strive for perfection.
<sally> :o be nice
<Andres> But wuggle is a creature that can be devoured for noms!
<Proto> it was a friendly push
<sally> noms you say? :o
<Articuno> 12Yeh
<Aurora> 6I'm not convinced it's perfection
<Proto> Trying to get his attention

<sally> friendly is good :) :p
<Articuno> 12Although I'd say I'm about 98% pleased with my Lugia Silver Soul pic XD
<Aurora> 6the fact that I know I'll never be perfect means there's limitless ways to explore art

<sally> :o what card game?
<loanshark> hi guys
<loanshark> ? list
<Stryker> I'm not even sure that's an accurate time. :P

<Brother|AlexBattler> RP4L; but then no plot for easily made profit sequels :P
<Roleplay4life> 5Welcome back. ^^
<EccoCode> hey and thank you RP4L
<Roleplay4life> 5@Brother :: Sure there is! Human resistance against the insane mutant purple kitty.
<Brother|AlexBattler> unless you want to go with "teh world is dead, and we are to lazy to save is so u do it." "Nu u"
<Brother|AlexBattler> but theres always human resistance XD
<Roleplay4life> 5My friend made an RP plot like that. The first sentence:
<Brother|AlexBattler> highly advanced machines couldnt beat the human resistance
<Nick> EXACTLY RP4L MEWTWO TURNED INTO WUSSIE POKEYMAN
<Nick> oh and hey EccoCode! :>
<Roleplay4life> 5"The first movie never happened, and number 150 is mad as hell."
<Andres> Okies :o
<Brother|AlexBattler> what will insane mutant creatures (oh noes we get into Fallout O:) be doing then XD
<loanshark> I saw softmod guide 4.2, is that specific guide for Wii's Menu Ver. 4.2U?
<EccoCode> heya Nick!
<Roleplay4life> 5I KNOW HE WAS BETTER BEFORE HE TURNED INTO A HIPPIE.
<Andres> www.elementsthegame.com if the sally asked that D:
<Brother|AlexBattler> YOU NIXIONITE YOU
*Brother|AlexBattler shot
<RennyC> Is it Amarokz?
<Andres> I am still highly amused by the fact that how many of those creatures I have in my Spore game XD
<RennyC> That's what I used, it worked but it was a bitch since it's poorly written
<Brother|AlexBattler> you all made torch butt leave XD
<Roleplay4life> 5There was the opportunity to go beast on Giovanni and Team Rocket but it never came. ;;
<Nick> EXACTLY RP4L THEREFORE ZOROARK
<Nick> SHOULD
<Nick> BE
<Nick> 4EEEVIIIIL!
<Brother|AlexBattler> thats because there must be a very veyr long epic battle
<Brother|AlexBattler> after 200 years
<Brother|AlexBattler> when EVIL RULES THE WORLD
<Brother|AlexBattler> and Nick is prime minister
<Roleplay4life> 5Why should Zoroark get that opportunity? It belongs to a legend.
<Nick> 4EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLL
<Brother|AlexBattler> it belongs to RP4L
<Nick> wait me prime minister?
<Brother|AlexBattler> Yes
<Roleplay4life> 5YEAH IT BELONGS TO ME.

*Nick declares war on Zororark then!
<Roleplay4life> 5NO.

<Roleplay4life> 5And who the heck is Agent 47?
<Stitch> It's quick and easy to download.
<Brother|AlexBattler> but sure we can have you assassinated too :D
<Roleplay4life> 5I like 42 better.
<Brother|AlexBattler> DDD:
<Nick> we will use all nukeular weapons against this demonic looking pokeyman and rid the world of its bad haircut!
<Brother|AlexBattler> you are no classic then D:<
<Stitch> And Aristeo, you said no?
<Roleplay4life> 5Actually 42 is my favourite number.
<Brother|AlexBattler> he's a SUPER SPECIAL AWSOME lone
<Brother|AlexBattler> *clone
<Roleplay4life> 5I like 36, too.
<Brother|AlexBattler> who is a hit man
<Brother|AlexBattler> who kills people
<Brother|AlexBattler> screw 42 :P
<Brother|AlexBattler> 47 is higher
<Roleplay4life> 5Yay for genetic copies? LOL.
<Brother|AlexBattler> and then he killsall the other clones O:
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<Roleplay4life> 5That's horrible.
<Brother|AlexBattler> because they wanted to kill him
<Brother|AlexBattler> well, its better then being hated by Pride :P
<Brother|AlexBattler> he'll eat you
<Roleplay4life> 5;;

<ramo34> ? softmod
<sally> lol i have no idea what i'm doing on this elements game
<Brother|AlexBattler> wait..drf is here
<Andres> I did not either :o
<^Wulfgar^> loanshark, 4.2 is 4.2...
<Brother|AlexBattler> RP4L: do you remember the movie independence day?
<RennyC> I hate 4.2 to hack, such a bitch
<Evil0ne> vs 4.1 thats really 8.0 :)
<Evil0ne> haha
<^Wulfgar^> just use the guide on the bot
<sally> hmmz
<RennyC> Just beware of Amarokz guide, I was able to use it after figuring where he fucked up heh
<^Wulfgar^> again...use the guide on the bot
<RennyC> Broken neogamma wad threw me off for a bit
<Proto> wb Stormy
<Stormy> thanks
<sally> hello
<Stormy> Hey
<Proto> You're welcome
<RennyC> Wii is probably the most fun to hack, due to all these IOS's and shit.
<^Wulfgar^> wii is simple to softmod
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14That movie was epic
<RennyC> v4.2 is kind of a bitch, PSP is easiest. Xbox 1 was the hardest and most nerve racking I've done (using Hotswap method)
<Brother|AlexBattler> NS reviewed it finally reviewed it XD
<Brother|AlexBattler> *NC
<Evil0ne> yea
<Evil0ne> hotswap isa bitch
<RennyC> Hotswap is manly as fuck
<^Wulfgar^> 4.2 isn't any harder than 4.1
<Evil0ne> yea i cheated i made a usb to xb adpter
<RennyC> I had the Xbox balancing on my PC case with them hooked into each other
<Evil0ne> lol
<Evil0ne> on i have done that
<Evil0ne> oh*
<Evil0ne> i just cheat now
<Evil0ne> i made the adapter and dedicated a 256mb thumb stick to it
<RennyC> I had to unlock the HDD by playing music and pausing
<Evil0ne> yea thats was always the easiet way via hotswap
<sally> :o
*Evil0ne still has 3 xb1's
<Evil0ne> all runnin xbmc
<RennyC> Alligator clips into the PC chasis also heh
<sally> laptoparisteooo
<ramo34> i could never found xbmc
<Evil0ne> hehe
<Evil0ne> i have there site
<Evil0ne> u can always get a OLD ass version from xbins lol
<Evil0ne> thou its like from 02
<Evil0ne> and they have 3 2010 builds lol
<RennyC> I heard they stopped working on it recently
<ramo34> i could never get my 500g to work
<Spyrorocks> hey Stitch I gtg for a bit bbl
<Spyrorocks> like 30mins
<Stitch> aww
<Evil0ne> T3CH XBMC 2010-07-08 SVN rev30442
<Evil0ne> and unless it locks
<RennyC> It'd be nice if Wii also had a homebrew entertainment system as polished as XBMC was
<Evil0ne> u cant lol
<EpicStatsGuy> :Ð· / :Ð— / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ”: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð„: / :Ñ
<jj26meu> wiimc is good
<Evil0ne> yea well wiimc is getting there
<ramo34> nope
<^Wulfgar^> wiimc ftw
<Evil0ne> no secuirty lock = no putting in a xb w/o a chip
<^Wulfgar^> if you want media, get a wdtv
<Evil0ne> haha
<Spyrorocks> dual layer dvds cost me fricken $2.50 a pop
<Evil0ne> or spend 20$ on a xb1 :)
<jj26meu> wdtv for the win
<Stitch> o.o
<RennyC> Shame Wii can't output 720p on video.
<Evil0ne> nethier can xb1 hah
<jj26meu> bad wireless support though
<Evil0ne> yea
<RennyC> evil0ne: it supports 720p, but on video I doubt it
<Evil0ne> there wifi is poooop
<RennyC> I run Soul Calibur 2 at 720p, looks nice :)
<Evil0ne> lol
<ramo34> how would i do evilone
<Spyrorocks> better not ruin them..
<RennyC> Too bad it's in 4:3
<Evil0ne> how would i do? huh
<Evil0ne> gooooder english
<Blackwolf> xbox1 can output 480p/720p/1080i
<Blackwolf> not many games that support abouve 480p tho
<Evil0ne> yea
<Spyrorocks> 8.5gb disc
<Blackwolf> lot of homebrew can tho
<Evil0ne> but xmbc wont play mkv
<Evil0ne> itll do mp4
<Evil0ne> itll studder but itll do it
<Blackwolf> xbmc does play mkv.. its just unwatchable
<ramo34> how would i install my 500g in my xb1
<Evil0ne> yea
<Blackwolf> its like 4 fps
<Evil0ne> :)
<Evil0ne> ramo: u got the eeprom?
<Blackwolf> ramo34 when you get above 250gb, make sure you split it and use F+G drives
<Evil0ne> i have a tool that makes xb hdd's
<Evil0ne> lol
<^Wulfgar^> ramo34, easier to ask in an xbox chat ;)
<Blackwolf> if not, it starts fucking up bad when one partition gets beyond 250gb
<Evil0ne> splits em up and everything :)
<Evil0ne> xbhdm :)
<Evil0ne> it splits f at 113gb
<RennyC> I need a program to split my SD card in half into WBFS
<^Wulfgar^> wbfs FTL
<RennyC> Wulfgar: what do you recommend doing then
<Evil0ne> yea i still use wbfs thou on my new hdd i might make it fat32
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:3
<Gochiruzeru> o.o
<^Wulfgar^> fat32 > * for wii
<RennyC> My friend bought a 1TB hdd and made it completely WBFS lol
<Evil0ne> yea
<Evil0ne> thats stupid
<RennyC> Wii is fine with Fat32?
<Evil0ne> i wouldnt even do that
<Evil0ne> yea
<^Wulfgar^> of course
<Evil0ne> wii does fat32/ntfs
<RennyC> Nice.
<Evil0ne> both
<Evil0ne> thou ntfs is a bitch
<^Wulfgar^> ntfs is read only
<Evil0ne> yea wich is jew
<Spyrorocks> bluray disks are like $10 a pop though
<RennyC> I'm new to the whole HDD loader shit to be honest, I used discs before on my ex-fiance's wii
<Evil0ne> lol
<Evil0ne> USB FTW
<RennyC> Her's is an older model that reads them, so I bought my own TODAY
<^Wulfgar^> please watch the racist comments
<Evil0ne> who
<RennyC> you
<RennyC> :P
<^Wulfgar^> you
<Evil0ne> uhhh
<Evil0ne> jew isnt raceist
<Evil0ne> btw
<Evil0ne> its religious
<SpooKy> i luv my new sig
<Sneas> Ih.
<Evil0ne> and i can say what i want about that its within my rights so dont even bother bitching bout it
<RennyC> Let's not start this argument
<RennyC> Not worth it, especially on the internet
<Evil0ne> i know
<Evil0ne> that and im half jewish kinda makes it poinless :)
<RennyC> He's just doing his job :P
<Evil0ne> i know
<SpooKy> ih
<RennyC> Oh well lol
<RennyC> Anyways, I'm impressed with Wii homebrew

<Quanyails> 7Then you shouldn't've made your previous scenes so strong. O.o
<Nick> yeah thats the downfall of my fic
<Nick> i need to make an ending that justifies the previous scenes D:
<Nick> maybe...4KILL 1Shadow Lugia with a 50 cal rifle?
<Quanyails> 7If you could change something in those scenes, what would it be?
*Nick runs flees and hides
<Lugia365> 12uhh
<Nick> well nothing really if they were previously strong I dont see why they need to be weaker
<Nick> and I was talking about my fanfic lugia365
<Quanyails> 7But you seem to be stuck since you need an ending which follows the previous scenes. o3o

<Brother|AlexBattler> 365: you play the game o3o
<Lugia365> 12yes it is, they ruind C&C
<Brother|AlexBattler> even I was scared XD
<Brother|AlexBattler> and? C&C is a horrible series in the end +RA
<Brother|AlexBattler> RA more so
<Brother|AlexBattler> C&C 2 is the best C&C imho
<Lugia365> 12I heard that they are making a C&C 5

<Brother|AlexBattler> I hope they dont make RA4 though >.>
<NodFanatic> Lugia365: I wouldn't put too much stock in that.
<Brother|AlexBattler> the RA series is sad and pathetic
<Lugia365> 12I know
<Brother|AlexBattler> and extremely racist and sexist in the 3rd instalment
<Brother|AlexBattler> XD
<Lugia365> 12RA series WAS supposed to connect to the tiberium series
<Brother|AlexBattler> RA one had some sense in that
<Lugia365> 12but EA bought them before that could happen
<NodFanatic> IIRC, Kane was involved witht he Soviet Empire in the original Red Alert.

<Athenon> although i remember getting a 64 because i learned how to ride a bike O_O

<Stormy> Aristeo's a girl now?
<drfsupercenter> 03it means an actual BSoD.
*Stryker eats the cookie at the same time.
*Aristeo nods
<Sonic41> And then remove 1.1 through the System Menu
<Stormy> :o
<Aristeo> Whenever Stryker and I are in the same sentence, yes
<rosch> is that what you did
<Sonic41> Yup
<Stryker> <3
*Proto offers Stryker a kitten
<Proto> Don't eat
*Stryker ea- cuddles it.
<rosch> ok gonna try that
<Stormy> D:
<rosch> arghh what's wrong with my sd card now
<Proto> good save :3
<sally> :o
<Sonic41> Apparently I'm not the only with things having to break down on them
<rosch> HBC won't show stuff unless i pop it out and in
*Proto really needs to get on that whole sending animals via internet thing
<rosch> RAGE
<Sonic41> D:
<Stormy> PETA would probably kill you
<sally> lol
<Linux> I feel like playing CoM now
<Stormy> I still want that puppy though :P
<Linux> but I can't
<Sonic41> Here, I'll try it myself
<Sonic41> Just to make sure it works
<rosch> kk erasing photo channel 1.1 now
<Sonic41> :P
<Sonic41> Oh nvm
<Sonic41> :P
<rosch> yay it's gone
<rosch> sweet
<Sonic41> Thought so
<rosch> ... why do i only have 1600 blocks free
<Andres|Away> I have to wonder how this crotch-gun, this one guy has in this movie, is operated
<rosch> versus the 2100 on my gf's wii
<Sonic41> :3
<Stormy> ...lolwtf?
<Sonic41> Why are you deleting all of the System Channels?
*Proto /will/ get Stormy a puppy
<rosch> i only want disc channel + hbc + mii
<rosch> i don't use anything else
<Proto> also, I hate peta
<Stormy> Who doesn't?
<Stormy> they're crazy
<Proto> there was a good line in the penn and teller show bs, about peta
<rosch> oh wow line rider 2 takes 128 blocks
<Sonic41> :O No Shop Channel?
<Proto> they're talking about an arsonist the ingrid lady, peta's founder calls a fine young man "If you can be a convicted arsonist who has admitted to starting at least seven fires and still be a fine young man, wtF does it take to be a monster?"
<rosch> i make things
<rosch> elebits is 109 blocks
<Creideiki> A pox on DSL!
<rosch> man.. how do these people program their saves
<Andres|Away> "...welcome to slavery." "No thanks, I've already had a wife."
<Sonic41> lawl
<rosch> so sonic make any games
<Sonic41> :( I haven't made progress
<Sonic41> It was too confusing to even get some code together
<Sonic41> Because it looks like it's all in C
<rosch> watcha mean
<Sonic41> printfs
<Sonic41> And other functions that I have to bring in
<Sonic41> There's so many that it blows my mind away
<rosch> you were the one who wanted to make a text game right lol
<y007ghg7> can someone help me find a pattern like whats used in the banner for the check mii out channel?
<Sonic41> lol yes
<Sonic41> I know how to make a simple one in C++
<Sonic41> :P
<rosch> you can do it in C then
<rosch> printf is easy to pick up
<Sonic41> It seems to be the same as cout
<rosch> similar
<rosch> cout would be like
<rosch> cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
<rosch> in printf it'd be
<rosch> printf("Hello, %s!", name);
<rosch> %s is like a placeholder for string
<Athenon> printf is dumb
<Sonic41> lol I went ahead and deleted my Photo Channel
<Sonic41> So I guess I can pick up C, then
<rosch> well go write a sample thing in C++
<rosch> and i'll do it in C
<rosch> and then you'll have a direct comparison
<Athenon> do....object oriented programming!
*Stitch was tab failed.
<Athenon> oh wait....... ;(
<Proto> yes
*Stitch falls out of a hydrogen proton.
<Andres|Away> Is it a delicious hydrogen proton? :o
<Stitch> No.
<Stitch> That's why I fell out of it.
<Stitch> I hated it.
<Sonic41> All right, lemme go to pastie
<Sonic41> lol, this was something I wrote up a few days ago out of boredom
<rosch> let's see
*Andres|Away puts some sugar on it!
<Sonic41> Almost
<Sonic41> http://pastie.org/1045035
<Sonic41> lol
<rosch> uh
<rosch> -.-
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKnGJ3xLsLY
<Aicebo> LOL
<Aicebo> LOL
<Aicebo> LOL
<rosch> lol not bad?
<Sonic41> :P
<|Shadow|> y007ghg7, rip the check mii out channel apart and get the open.br file
<Stormy> ......
<Sonic41> I bet it's horrible
<Stormy> Hahahah
<Stormy> XDDD
<rosch> lol it's really simple
<SpooKy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpf1CiRuxxw
<True_ai> Video Title: PokÃ©mon Diamond &amp;amp; Pearl - Ending - ã€Œå›ã®èƒ¸ã«LaLaLaã€ English Subbed
<Sonic41> I know
<Sonic41> :P
<|Shadow|> and i think banner.br also
<SpooKy> ^ fail
<rosch> now make something more complicated
<rosch> lol
<y007ghg7> i just need a pattern like thats used in the background of the banner
<Aicebo> probably because cynder so hawt
<Athenon> i dont get what the namespace is
<Stormy> Cynder wants to take a ride on Spyro's disco stick
<Stormy> o.O
<Aicebo> indeed.
<y007ghg7> the blue/orande squares\
<Aicebo> XD.
<y007ghg7> orange*
<rosch> std?
<Stormy> that's rather disturbing
<rosch> it's so you don't have to put
<Kanhi> 2meh?
<rosch> std::cout
<Stormy> But still funny
<rosch> and can just shortcut to cout
<Aicebo> I think masterblui made a spyro video to that song a long time ago too
<Kanhi> 2...hello?
<Stormy> the best part is they didn't mean for it to be funny :P
<Athenon> so if you say using again, it replaces std with something else, or it adds to it?
<Hurricane> hello?
<Aicebo> hahahah
<rosch> something else
<Kanhi> 2Hi!
<rosch> so if i go
<rosch> using namespace blah blah
<rosch> using cout << on it's own won't work anymore
<rosch> since it'll be like
<rosch> wtf is cout
<rosch> you have to specify what namespace you're in
<rosch> it's similar to java packages
*Stryker winces.
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRHCCrSSdk
*Stryker bleeds.
<Athenon> oh ok
<Proto> D:
*Tornado vaccuums up Hurricane and Kanhi!
*Proto casts Heal on Stryker
<Athenon> yes and no
<rosch> similar but not exactly
<rosch> it'sl ike if you don't import a package
<Nick> o.o
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14wtf
<rosch> you have to go
<Glacymr> 12huh
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL wut
<Kanhi> 2uh...hi?
<Athenon> yeah, cuz java packages are like includes.....you dont have just 1 and it can just find whatever youre looking for
<Nick> how did THat happen? Dx
<Stormy> lol what on earth does that have to do with Spyro?
<Sonic41> All right, I'm working with something here.
<Stormy> XD
<Aicebo> idk she always does pop videos
*Kanhi 2is eating marshmellows
<Sonic41> I'm going to make use of char
<rosch> i'm trying to find somewwhere to buy
<rosch> a USA version of pop'n music
<Athenon> never heard of it
<|Shadow|> get the channel and rip it apart
<Athenon> rosch, you from the us?
<J-Lugia> ?
<|Shadow|> u will have the banner in the right size
<rosch> no i'm from canada
<SheenaFox> what the f-
<|Shadow|> then edit the banner file
<Aicebo> but of course that was last year when using as many effects as you could was all the rage too :P
<Athenon> ahh
<SheenaFox> Thanks XD
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12WTF!?!?
<Athenon> so you know all aboot the maple leaf
<SheenaFox> I got notice'd too
<rosch> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop%27n_Music <-- there's a japenese and an EU release
<Kanhi> 2thankyou
<rosch> but no USA
*EccoCode blinks in surprise
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12what was that?
<SheenaFox> Spam o3o
<Aicebo> lol I remember all my haters "u need 2 add mor effects!!!!!"
<Glacymr> 12i have a feeling this isn't over
<Brother|AlexBattler> has a 4 letter word
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12lolwow
*Kanhi 2is going to her first anime convention
<Brother|AlexBattler> starts with t
<Brother|AlexBattler> ends with l
<Nick> lol that was random o3o
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12who was that!?
<|Shadow|> use nus downlaoder to get the files
<|Shadow|> dont patch as wad
<|Shadow|> pack*
<y007ghg7> xD
<y007ghg7> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK9pi-XsV0M
<Kanhi> 2who was what?
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12idk?
<J-Lugia> even though you kicked him from the channel, you didn't kick him from the server -v-
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12I noticed when my mIRC was freking out
<Lunies> He was just on #rp
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12oh
<Glacymr> 12i don't have the authority to kick him from the server
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14None of us do :\
<Kanhi> 2w00t it's a party inhere!
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12That was one heck of a troll
*Kanhi 2dances
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Draelen does but he's probably sleeping
<Lugia365||YouTube> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12arti needs to promote more Opers
<Stormy> I remember the video you made about that
<Lugia365> 12ya I'll say
<Aicebo> hahahahah
<Aicebo> and then that one ignorant [censored] I still hate but keeps trying to be my friend was all like "cool video nice effects!!! subbed!"
<Stormy> with all the tons of effects and people were all saying "OMG IT'S AMAZING"
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Glacymr: We'll have to speak to her about that
<Stormy> Haha
<Andres|Away> What happened to the Strykah? D:
<Lugia365> 12brb
<Aicebo> even though she was subbed to me a long time before that then unsubbed because I wasn't effecty
<Glacymr> 12indeed
*Kanhi 2likes eating marshmellows and dancing to Nightcore
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, I've poked her about it plenty times XD
<Glacymr> 12she probably won't listen then
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14drf: we'll all have to mention it then
<Aicebo> that girl also recently just got 1000 subs but all my friends agree she had the most lazy 1000 subs video ever and that she didn't really deserve them
<Glacymr> 12it's perfectly logical to have a server this big with only 3 opers
<Aicebo> she makes the colors and textures look cool and stuff but nothing ever matches and her lipsyncing is terrible
<Glacymr> 12whe all 3 aren't active enough
<Stormy> it seems like the goal of a lot of videos I see are to cram in as many effects as possible
<Glacymr> 12*when
<Aicebo> a lot less people are like that this year but last year that's all it was haha
<Lugia365> 12vback
<Lugia365> 12back*
<Aicebo> one of my friends does amaaaazing videos, she's like a little effecty but a little not
<Stormy> Maybe I'm just watching the old ones lol
<Sonic41> Woooo, I actually made a program that compiled and ran on the first try!
<Aicebo> and does amazing lipsync/dance videos
<Sonic41> :D
<Sonic41> And everything worked as intended
<Athenon> i do that more and more xP
*Curly puts bandaids on Stryker
<Stormy> I don't really search for them
<Athenon> often i have a couple syntax errors and everything else works fine
<Aicebo> lol
<Stormy> I just click on the ones that come up under related on yours
<sally> curly :O
<Stryker> It died.
<Aicebo> hahah
<Curly> sally o:
<Proto> :<
<Stryker> A sad painful death.
<Proto> Hey Curly
<Spyrorocks> alright, osx is booting now
<Spyrorocks> without a boot cd
<Spyrorocks> yay.
<Curly> hi Proto ^^
<Proto> :)
<sally> hi curly :)
<Lugia365> 12that was a good troll, but I've seen better
<loanshark> I try to do the 1st step from tutorial Softmod 4.2, and I got the messenge on the screen saying that "The device inserted in the SD Card Slot cannot be used" when I inserted 1GB micro SD into it with appropriate files.
*Stryker is a corpse now and cannot respond.
<Curly> but.. bandaids D:
<Sonic41> :P I guess I'm getting better
<Stryker> But blood loss. :O
<Curly> also rawr *still has not slept*
<Curly> fine then D:
<Creideiki> Why would a server need more then one operator-- Oh, and IRC operator. Because a real paid operator for a server is mildly expensive. ("So what is your job?" "I'm a computer operator so... I sit around eating donuts and drinking coffee on company money, watching a computer screen to make sure it doesn't crash. Otherwise yeah... my job is awesome." "And you get paid how much?" "More than you.")
*Curly gets the gauze and tape
<DeathLok> formatted to fat32?
<sally> ducttape!
<loanshark> I did formated on both fat16 and fat32, but it won't work.
*Andres|Away puts his blood in the Strykahling.
<Andres|Away> Fixed!
<DeathLok> maybe it just doesnt like your card
*Andres|Away mends the wounds with duct tape!
*Aristeo gives Stryker a pheonix down
<loanshark> I'm wondering if my 1GB microSD compatible to Wii or not.
<Andres|Away> If there are some.
<Lugia365> 12how did he do that anyway? looks like a complicated code of some sort
<Stryker> :O
*Stryker is nao moar like teh Andres.
<sally> duct tape always helps :)
<DeathLok> thats what I just said :P
<Aicebo> so have any of you seen my new recoloring yet http://aicebo.deviantart.com/art/Bambi-x-Kovu-On-Letting-Go-171314951
<loanshark> ah
<Sonic41> lol
<Sonic41> I'm trying to implement an error for inputting an invalid character cohice
<Sonic41> *choice
<Stormy> I haven't gone through my deviantart messages in forever
<Sonic41> And I made it loop infinitely
<Creideiki> It doesn't look at all complex.
<Sonic41> :3
<Aicebo> lol
<Lugia365> 12ist was a script...
<Lugia365> 12so it would be complex to me lol
<Creideiki> Simple FOR/NEXT loop.
<Stormy> Aw, that's cute
<Lugia365> 12I heard 3 "dings" on my computer every time he posted that message lol
<Aicebo> yeah my friend drew it then she gave it to me to recolor
<Lugia365> 12I feel like I shuld scan my computer for viruses o3o
<Creideiki> In each repetation grab a random number between 0 and 16, apply that as the colour value for the letter, continue. Then just post it.
<Lugia365> 12...
<Creideiki> Repeat script ad nauseam (or ad ban.)
<Aicebo> recoloring's fun when I'm REALLY bored otherwise I just get frustrated, idk how all those awesome artists have the patience for it
<Andres|Away> If I was narcissistic or whatever, the Strykah would now find me attractive \o/
<Lugia365> 12you melted my brain XD
<Proto> lol
<sally> x)
<Lugia365> 12I'm not that good with computer stuff like that
<Andres|Away> Since I carry my mind in my bloodcells.
<Andres|Away> Anyways.
*Andres|Away regenerates his blood.
<Glacymr> 12random number generator
<Stryker> Does that mean I hate the Andres now?
<Lugia365> 12Oh
<Lugia365> 12thanks
<Glacymr> 12then put a color code symbol in front of that random number thing
<Athenon> i hear programming if your irc nick starts with S increases the liklihood that youll suck penis later in life
<Lugia365> 12was it a script, or the flood thing used on mIRC?
<Creideiki> Random number generator with a loop.
<Glacymr> 12and you have a color made at random
<Lugia365> 12I see
<Athenon> just kidding xP
<Creideiki> Remember the loop. As it decreases code length.
<Lugia365> 12Right
<Andres|Away> Why? o.o
<Lugia365> 12so it was a script
<Andres|Away> Oh, right.
<Creideiki> A script triggered multiple times.
<Lugia365> 12lolwow
<Andres|Away> At least you will see yourself as the beautiful person that you are! :o
<Lugia365> 12sounds like he uses mIRC... I think
<Andres|Away> Fair trade.
<Creideiki> Most standalone clients support scripts.
<Creideiki> Doesn't matter if mIRC is used or not.
<Lugia365> 12oh
<Creideiki> I have scripts in my X-Chat. :P
<Lugia365> 12cool
<Lugia365> 12I'm just guessing that mIRC is one of the best then since I hear about it a lot
<Lugia365> 12hang on
<Creideiki> It's the most prolific, which isn't necessarily the best.
<Lugia365> 12oh
<Linux> o.o
<Proto> wb Stitch
<Proto> Stryker
*Stitch was tab failed.
*Lugia365 is thinking how to activate the mIRC flood script.
<Lugia365> 12How do you activate it?
<Sonic41> lolwut
<Creideiki> I have a menu for my scripts. How you do it in mIRC... ask a mIRC user.
<Lugia365> 12right
<Lugia365> 12on mIRC it's in the options > IRC > flood
<Lugia365> 12idk how to activate that lol
<|Shadow|> use a real sd card kthx
<Andres> I might need some coffee...
<Andres> I should probably be awake by now.
<sally> i might need my emergency fruit roll-ups
<Andres> But since I have not actually gone to sleep, then I shall shrug.
<Lugia365> 12wow
<Lugia365> 12I thought he would be back by now

<Lugia365> 12and came back on as LugiaGOD
<Lugia365> 12and got banned XD

<Lugia365> 12I thought my mIRC was freaking out when I first saw it LOL
<Aeroslash> XD
<Lugia365> 12ya

*Lugia365 runs
<Proto> D:
<Aicebo> draw an owl
<Aicebo> :D
<sally> indeed
<Andres> D:
<InfamousZed> wtf
<Andres> Why sadness?
<Stormy> Hmm
<InfamousZed> wtf is an urgal
<InfamousZed> i google it and i still dont know what it is
<Stormy> Owl sounds like a good idea actually
<InfamousZed> hoothoot
<sally> bf :I
<Aristeo> :o
<RedDragonX> It's a character type out of the book Eragon
<Aristeo> What's wrong? D:
<Proto> D:
<Stormy> I painted an owl in like 7th grade but it sucked :P
<InfamousZed> aw... you got to paint?
*Stormy is not the biggest fan of Eragon
<sally> he was being a butt
*Proto glares at BlueFusion|laptop
<Proto> :|
<Stormy> Yeah
<InfamousZed> never watched eragon
<RedDragonX> what's wrong with Eragon lol
<RedDragonX> the movie sucks
<Stormy> It's... boring
<RedDragonX> the book is ok
<sally> i dont see blue fusion anything
<Lugia365> 12Finally!
<Stormy> And I don't really like any of the characters
<Proto> He's not here right now
<RedDragonX> I guess finding it boring just depends on your taste of reading
<Proto> lol
<sally> lol oh
<Stormy> Eragon is just annoying and a Gary Stu
<InfamousZed> gary stu?
<RedDragonX> yeah Stormy is a gary stu nazi too lol
<Stormy> Lol
*RedDragonX shrugs
<Stormy> It makes characters boring when they're like that
<RedDragonX> it's all different depending on how you take books
<InfamousZed> that nazi bloods got to shoot down sometihng
<RedDragonX> I find Harry Potter boring
<RedDragonX> that's just me
<Stormy> eh
*Aristeo adopts sally and gives sally's BF a pillow as a replacement
<InfamousZed> i find books boring
<sally> x)
<Stormy> it's not for everyone
*RedDragonX finds books boring to
<Aristeo> ........ a really nice pillow though
<RedDragonX> I read one every now and then though
<Stormy> I find Eragon to be full of cliches as well
<Aristeo> He'll be able to have a very nice, relaxing, and comfortable sleep
<Aristeo> All alone in his bed
<RedDragonX> helps me sound somewhat intelligent
<sally> lol how shweet
<Aristeo> But comfortable
<InfamousZed> i listen to them on my mp3 player
<RedDragonX> I find any story to be full of cliches no matter what
<Stormy> Well of course
<Stormy> But Eragon consists almost entirely of them
<RedDragonX> unless it copies an idea word for word it usually doesn't bother me
<Stormy> which is fine with me
<Stormy> as long as the characters are likable
<Stormy> which they're not
<InfamousZed> i need to finish what i drew...
<InfamousZed> i drew something lambda might find interesting
<Aristeo> :3
*Aristeo sits next to sally
<Stormy> Star Wars?

<Soyuz> he doesnt have a job though he doesnt have that type of thing
<Soyuz> because glenn beck isnt what you're in
<Soyuz> hasnt experienced them

<Pirate> it's what he needs
<Pirate> an eye opener
<Pirate> >.>
<Pirate> then again
<Soyuz> He needs to be shot
<Pirate> i think he's the type
<Pirate> that would live in denile of it
<Pirate> till he died from lack of food
<Pirate> as he's that closed minded
<Soyuz> that'd be an amusing site if it was glenn beck
<Soyuz> *sight
<Soyuz> if only because, he's literally even for that Arizona law
<Soyuz> "we dont give a <censored> about you, because god tell us"
<Pirate> well i always wanted to see this

<hesperaux> Greetings. I've been here before and have read the rules. I want to say that first. Secondly, I have found at tutorial on "installing homebrew, etc. on 4.3U" and I'd appreciate it if some of you guys could tell me if the tutorial is worth trying. I don't know much about this scene, so I'm guessing that just posting this link will get me banned from this channel. I ask in advance that I not be banned; if something is wrong with th
<hesperaux> e link, please tell me what it is.
<hesperaux> I'll wait to post the link until somebody says to go ahead. Site is wiihacks.com
<MuzerNtbk> right.
<MuzerNtbk> Most of the tutorials are pretty risky (if you mess just one thing up, your Wii is likely to be bricked, or at least messed up)
<hesperaux> hmm.
<hesperaux> may I show you this tutorial?
<^Wulfgar^> wii sucks for media...which is why I got a wdtv
<MuzerNtbk> Also, some of the methods on the internet contain illegal parts (though there is nothing intrinsically illegal about the process, and it can be done legally)
<MuzerNtbk> if you want
<hesperaux> http://www.wiihacks.com/general-homebrew-hack-issues/61574-4-3-fix.html
<|MB|> all consoles do
<y007ghg7> hi shadow clone
<^Wulfgar^> 360/ps3 isn't bad...but I love being able to play ANY format
<MuzerNtbk> it looks to me like you already need to have installed something on your Wii before to do that
<|MB|> 360 ps3 is too restrictive too
<MuzerNtbk> "4.3 Fix
<MuzerNtbk> Requires cIOS to be installed"
<dasefx> yep, all consoles do, i got a mac mini only for xbmc
<hesperaux> I think steps ah. I missed that
<|MB|> ofc those also do hd
<|MB|> but thats it
<hesperaux> even though it's huge
<|MB|> still clunky
<|MB|> converting and media streamers
<dasefx> yeh :|
<|MB|> gotta run a pc with them
<[NiNjA]UK> i am truly hoping the next ps3 update will allow samba shares
<[NiNjA]UK> hate having to stream
<hesperaux> what is cIOS. better yet, what does IOS stand for?
<|MB|> and playing them directly omeans conversiosn cuz they hate mkv subs etc
<[NiNjA]UK> almost bought wdtv but may go for the acer revo option with xbmc latest build
<|MB|> besides no proper indexing etc
<|MB|> nothing beats a dediatced medi device
<|MB|> ia
<dasefx> xbmc ftw, nothing comes close
<|MB|> dependign on how much u wanna spend
<[NiNjA]UK> i still run xbox1 in all the bedrooms running and booting too xbmc
<MuzerNtbk> IOS, nobody knows for sure what it stands for (it's an internal Nintendo thing), but people have guessed things like Input Output System (what I reckon) or Integrated Operating System
<[NiNjA]UK> alongside the ps3/360/wii (depending on the bedrooms)
<y007ghg7> i need a modchip for my 3 xboxes
<[NiNjA]UK> softmod them y007ghg7
<MuzerNtbk> basically, the Wii is quite complicated internally - there are two processors!
<[NiNjA]UK> www.smdepot.net
<[NiNjA]UK> very easy
<y007ghg7> i cant find the game needed
<[NiNjA]UK> eBay
<|MB|> its just xb1 is big ugly and doesnt do every hd file
<[NiNjA]UK> splinter cell is my preference
<|MB|> and no hdmi
<^Wulfgar^> wdtv ftw
<hesperaux> two processors for two different tasks?
<[NiNjA]UK> it doesnt do HD at all |MB|
<MuzerNtbk> one controls all of the standard stuff that was in the gamecube (the "Broadway"), and is what all games run on
<y007ghg7> i got 3 xboxes from my friend
<[NiNjA]UK> acer evo + xbmc > wdtv
<|MB|> well i thought it coudl play some 1080i/720 xvid content
<^Wulfgar^> wdtv/pch > *
<MuzerNtbk> the other controls all the new Wii hardware and the security system - this is what IOS runs on
<[NiNjA]UK> wulfgar wrong
<y007ghg7> i got 3 xboxes from my friend 2 with a broken powersupply which i fixed
<hesperaux> very strange
<MuzerNtbk> so, to talk to the Wii hardware, everything (in theory) has to go through IOS
<|MB|> the preference depends on hwo much u wanna spend
<[NiNjA]UK> the whole coverflow on xbmc so much better
<|MB|> if u wanna stay cheap wdtv is where its at
<[NiNjA]UK> you spend roughly the same on acer revo then wdtv
<^Wulfgar^> havent' seen wdtv with cfw?
<hesperaux> sounds like processor 2 is a very advanced northbridge
<dasefx> latest mac mini + xbmc > acer evo + xbmc > wdtv > nmt (popcorn hour first models)
<[NiNjA]UK> exactly :)
<|MB|> if u want eevry bell and whistle and nice customizations u would want xbmc htpc
<hesperaux> is there a wiki or something about this?
<[NiNjA]UK> dasefx - they have xbmc on mac mini runnning now ?
<dasefx> yeh
<travolta> dasefx, if you are talking price, yes
<travolta> lmao
<[NiNjA]UK> nice
<[NiNjA]UK> althoguh would be such a waste of mac mini
<MuzerNtbk> now, since when you implement something or fix something in an IOS, there's a possibility of problems occuring with some older software, Nintendo decided to skip the problems with testing all the games entirely, and install each new IOS into a new slot, keeping all the old versions.
<|MB|> way too expensive
<MuzerNtbk> the only time when an IOS is updated is in a security update (stopping homebrew)
<dasefx> nah i write some apps for the iphone when i'm not playing or watching tv. all in my living room :)
<|MB|> migth as well build a proper htpc
<hesperaux> interesting
<dasefx> haha i'm sounding like a mac fanboy, i'm notttttt
<MuzerNtbk> cIOS is basically a hacked IOS with extra features and some security removed installed in one of the high-up slots (I can't remember which is used nowadays)
<MuzerNtbk> the wiki to find out about all this is wiibrew.org
<hesperaux> okay
<hesperaux> is the HBC/wiibrew scene against cIOS?
<|MB|> i have a dune prime myself, but maybe on hindsight u shoudl have gotten somethign else
<|MB|> i*
<MuzerNtbk> mostly, as its main use is piracy
<hesperaux> WADs are also strictly forbidden, right?
<MuzerNtbk> well again, mostly, because it is mainly for piracy
<Galaxy|> only WADs of pirated content are
<MuzerNtbk> but if you have a good reason for using one or the other, they are fine
<Galaxy|> system titles are fine
<Galaxy|> !wb NUSD
<IOS61> NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, so WADs used in that tutorial may be fine?
<IOS61> NUS Downloader, or NUSD, is a PC Utility designed to allow easy access to the resources present on Nintendo's Update Servers. Using this tool, you can download, pack, and decrypt many system titles into WADs ready to install.
<Galaxy|> ^ is one such good example of a proper use for them
<hesperaux> hmm, okay
<Galaxy|> depends on what its installing
<MuzerNtbk> cIOSes can be very useful in (for example) media players, for allowing USB2.0 support; whereas WADs can be very useful for updating just parts of your system.
<hesperaux> it doesn't say. there are 17 different WADs though lol
<Galaxy|> anything that makes you install that much crap might not be worth the time or effort
<hesperaux> would I need a cIOS to watch DVDs? (one of the things I hope to do eventually)
<hesperaux> lol, alright
<Galaxy|> no actually you don't
<Galaxy|> you just need DVDX
<Galaxy|> so long as you are running a System Menu below 4.3 you can use that app
<MuzerNtbk> hmm
<hesperaux> I can't really use it anyway, unless I install another cIOS thing. They called it a softmod, so I probably can't do that.
<IOS61> hesperaux: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Galaxy|> it enables the DVD Playback features in IOS
<MuzerNtbk> the problem is with DVDs is that some newer Wiis block it in hardware
<MuzerNtbk> well, not strictly speaking hardware
<Galaxy|> yep :(
<hesperaux> Unfortunately I was a tardbasket and updated to 4.3 lol
<Galaxy|> drive firmware
<MuzerNtbk> DVD drive firmware more like
<|Shadow|> dasefx, dont hide it
<|Shadow|> u r one
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: then you are SOL for the time being
<MuzerNtbk> but you can't change that from software as far as we know
<hesperaux> I purchased my wii...two years ago?
<MuzerNtbk> that should be fine then
<Galaxy|> do you have a bootmii nand backup you can restore to?
<IOS61> Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Galaxy|> yeah yeah yeah stupid bot
<MuzerNtbk> I believe it was mid-2009 when they started blocking it
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, nope. =( I have never used homebrew before
<Galaxy|> eesh yeah
<Galaxy|> you'll have to wait for a new HackMii Installer
<Galaxy|> don't worry though one is in the works
<Galaxy|> :
<Galaxy|> )
<Galaxy|> :)
<hesperaux> I checked here a few weeks ago
<hesperaux> Just checking again to see what has arose in the meantime
<Galaxy|> dhewg needs to htfu
<Galaxy|> >_<
<hesperaux> In one sense, I hope they obfuscate the hell out of their exploits, but in the other sense, I am impatient! =)
<Galaxy|> oh they do
<hesperaux> it'd be better for everyone if they take their time i suppose
<Galaxy|> yep
<MuzerNtbk> lol, exactly
<hesperaux> Nintendo makes me rage... -.-''
<MuzerNtbk> but yeah, 2 years ago should be fine for DVDs - they started blocking mid-2009 I think
<MuzerNtbk> so that's one good thing
<hesperaux> MuzerNtbk, I can't remember when I bought it because I haven't used it that much, but I should be fine there I think
<MuzerNtbk> yeah, hopefully
<hesperaux> I played all the way through twilight princess (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and that is about it
<hesperaux> I have brawl, but I haven't even played it
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: having an older wii you could probably use formatter
<MuzerNtbk> btw, do you have either Super Smash Bros. Brawl (US version) or Lego Indiana Jones (any version)?
<Galaxy|> its a tool you run from bootmii totally formats the nand and starts over
<hesperaux> I have the US version of brawl
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, not without bootmii he can't :P
<Galaxy|> good idea to use bootmii to make a nand backup first
<IOS61> Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<MuzerNtbk> henkpoley, good
<Galaxy|> i know
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> lol bot
<MuzerNtbk> it's "backup" that triggers it (not for me because I'm an op :P)
<Galaxy|> IOS61: you should really check the context of the sentence
<MuzerNtbk> lukegb needs to update it
<hesperaux> haha
<MuzerNtbk> he told me he would ages ago
<Galaxy|> indeed :\
<Galaxy|> nand backup
<IOS61> Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Galaxy|> lame
<hesperaux> Very sensitive around here =|
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Galaxy|> with good reason hesperaux
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<Galaxy|> its bad enough Nintendo has labeled us in the same boat as pirates
<Galaxy|> removing all doubt would only make it worse for us
<MuzerNtbk> so many pirates come here and don't read the many messages scattered around the place in big red letters
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> Well, for one thing, the homebrew project has to hold a reputation to Nintendo as being legitimate
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, I understand
<Galaxy|> Nintendo doesn't give a shit
<Galaxy|> we are no different to them than pirates
<hesperaux> apparently
<Galaxy|> they hold us in no esteem
<Galaxy|> we are the enemy
<hesperaux> ragetastic
<Galaxy|> they've made that perfectly clear
<hesperaux> 4.3's update made that abundantly clear
<Galaxy|> and yet you updated why?
<Galaxy|> > _ <
<hesperaux> i actually read the update text when I installed it. i think i was probably smoking something
<hesperaux> yeah that was retarded of me
<hesperaux> i wanted the shop channel is all
<Galaxy|> that seems to be the common thread
<hesperaux> =/
<hesperaux> they were smart there
<Galaxy|> people take the hit for the shop to work
<hesperaux> very devious of them
<Galaxy|> all you have to do is install 2 wads for the system titles
<Galaxy|> and you're set
<hesperaux> i heard about that later lol
<Galaxy|> the latest shop and its ios
<hesperaux> i had homebrew in mind when i bought the wii
<hesperaux> i just never did it in fear of the risks, so I knew very little about it
<Galaxy|> you hosed all your fakesign capable ioses though :(
<Galaxy|> certain 1337 tools need it
<Galaxy|> the average user however won't need fakesign capabilities
<hesperaux> when i updated, I thought the only thing around was the HBC. I didn't even guess that there would be a modded Shop
<Galaxy|> there isn't a modded shop
<MuzerNtbk> homebrew is _very_ riskless on the Wii when you go the Twiizers way
<Galaxy|> they just update it with a newer version that can authenticate with the service and they shut out hte old client
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, if I get into this, I'll probably try to do anything and everything I can. I like to hack around with my toys
<hesperaux> MuzerNtbk, at the time I didn't have that impression, unfortunately
<Galaxy|> given the state of your wii now it might not be as easy anymore
<Galaxy|> what with the having patched all the good exploits to roll back ioses
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, well, I'm sure they'll come out with a new exploit
<hesperaux> I hope they do
<Galaxy|> nothing public
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: you could take a drastic cut and use formatter to wipe the nand start over
<Galaxy|> then use your brawl disk to do a system update to get all the nice versioned fakesign capable ioses
<hesperaux> it's possible to run wiibrew through brawl right?
<MuzerNtbk> no, of course not. But you can do anything you want from bootmii.
<hesperaux> i mean bootmii
<Galaxy|> yes
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, yeah, you can install it through brawl
<hesperaux> install it or run it?
<Galaxy|> both
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, you can run *homebrew* right now through brawl
<hesperaux> ;o
<hesperaux> i knew i could run homebrew
<MuzerNtbk> just not install anything
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<hesperaux> i didn't know i could *install* bootmii
<MuzerNtbk> not now
<MuzerNtbk> but later
<hesperaux> bootmii is what...a chainloader?
<Galaxy|> you can install bootmii as boot2
<Galaxy|> the system menu can't check and remove that
<MuzerNtbk> bootmii is a replacement bootloader
<Galaxy|> its not in the nand fs
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, but not right now
<hesperaux> hmm
<MuzerNtbk> until they get a new exploit in
<Galaxy|> yep
<MuzerNtbk> basically, bootmii shoves IOS out of the way
<MuzerNtbk> so you can do whatever the hell you like with the hardware
<MuzerNtbk> very useful for Wii Linux
<Galaxy|> its getting more and more ios like as time passes
<hesperaux> Ah, Galaxy|, you are suggesting I wipe the NAND later
<Galaxy|> you can if you want to
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, yeah, but without the security
<Galaxy|> the only risk for that is shop certs or something to that effect
<MuzerNtbk> or the limitations
<Galaxy|> crediar is learning how to emulate ES
<hesperaux> I'll wanna do Wii Linux. I've been using linux for 4 years =)
<Galaxy|> he's got it down pretty well
<hesperaux> is it possible to do a network boot of linux on the wii?
<Galaxy|> I don't think so
<Galaxy|> it doesn't have the required software on the client end to do PXE
<MuzerNtbk> not AFAIK
<MuzerNtbk> the network is tough on the Wii
<MuzerNtbk> needs firmware
<hesperaux> ok
<MuzerNtbk> which needs a filesystem
<Galaxy|> we can't get network from MINI yet because of firmware, no USB support in MINI etc
<Galaxy|> its on its way though
<hesperaux> I might be able to boot off NFS though once a kernel is loaded, right?
<Galaxy|> that should be reasonable yeah
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, If you have an initrd with all the firmware in
<hesperaux> that would save a lot of space
<MuzerNtbk> I don't see why not
<hesperaux> how much internal ROM does the wii have?
<MuzerNtbk> though booting off SD or USB would probably be easier
<hesperaux> Can I boot from usb hard drives?
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<hesperaux> tasty...
<MuzerNtbk> that is implemented
<MuzerNtbk> though you have to be handy with a hex editor
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> hex edit the command line option
<hesperaux> I could probably figure it out
<MuzerNtbk> to point to your HDD
<hesperaux> ok
<hesperaux> i'd need to keep the drive in the same port then I assume (all the time)
<MuzerNtbk> no
<MuzerNtbk> as long as you don't have two drives
<hesperaux> okay
<MuzerNtbk> if you have two, it'll be pretty random which order they are detected in
<MuzerNtbk> as the Wii's USB bus is pretty haphazard
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> although I think it's improved with bootmii
<hesperaux> right now, could I run the smash stack exploit in order to run bootmii, then use bootmii to use a formatter? or would that be a distrastrous disaster?
<MuzerNtbk> you can't run/install bootmii as it stands, it needs an exploit
<hesperaux> okay
<MuzerNtbk> but an exploit is guaranteed to come at the same time as the HBC exploit :P
<hesperaux> =)
<Galaxy|> wrapped up in a bundle of obfusicated love
<Staraptorhawk> hi
<hesperaux> haha
<Galaxy|> HackMii Installer v0.7
<hesperaux> i love that word...obfuscate
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<MuzerNtbk> it is a great word
<hesperaux> makes me want to obfuscate nintendo
<hesperaux> rage
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Galaxy|> no sense in raging
<hesperaux> indeed
<Galaxy|> the wii is pretty much cracked for life
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<hesperaux> why do you say that?
<Galaxy|> because it is
<Galaxy|> they can't fix smash stack
<Galaxy|> they'd need to reissue patched disks
<hesperaux> =) and i own that game. \o/
<hesperaux> is it any fun to play it by yourself? heh...
<MuzerNtbk> this was an easter egg in the first Twilight Hack that actively worked around Nintendo's fixes:
<MuzerNtbk> http://hackmii.com/2008/06/twilight-hack-v01beta1/#comment-1610
<MuzerNtbk> usually good for rebuilding motivation
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> It did actually type it out just like the one in Portal does |P
<MuzerNtbk> *:P
<hesperaux> we do what we must because we can. <---lold
<hesperaux> that's great
<hesperaux> homebrew comes back and we make a neat hack
<MuzerNtbk> it's based on Still Alive from Portal if you didn't realise
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> yeah i noticed
<Galaxy|> if comex really wanted to I am sure he could revive BannerBoMB
<hesperaux> that is another game I own and have enjoyed
<Galaxy|> but he's too busy off in iPhone lala land
<hesperaux> aww :( iphoney fail...
*hesperaux likes android =)
<Galaxy|> just stay away from the Droid-X and its self destructing boot loader :(
<hesperaux> hehe
<hesperaux> as a matter of fact, i'm staying away from verizon entirely as soon as I can
<Galaxy|> what boggles my mind about android is the fact it doesn't make use of GPU accelerated graphics
<hesperaux> thinking of buying a used G1, putting the latest android on it, and tasting the beef
<Galaxy|> that would make it so much more useable :(
<hesperaux> yeah =/
<hesperaux> perhaps as android matures, it will implement that
<Galaxy|> that blew my mind to read that
<Galaxy|> taking a lot of the graphcs rendering burden off the CPU would lengthen battery life and make it snappy as hell on even the older devices
<eXAKR> hi
<hesperaux> indeed
<Galaxy|> someone should port android to the Wii
<Galaxy|> that'd be amazing
<hesperaux> ;o
<MuzerNtbk> OMG
<hesperaux> too bad I didn't stay a CS student
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Galaxy|> CS is a lame major these days anyway
<MuzerNtbk> port it to Starlet
<hesperaux> btw, what architecture is the CPU in the wii?
<MuzerNtbk> easier than porting to Broadway
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, Broadway is PPC
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, yeah, now I'm electrical eng.
<hesperaux> power pc? hmm
<MuzerNtbk> Starlet (security/IOS) is ARM
<hesperaux> arm ;o
<Galaxy|> 720?MHz PowerPC
<Galaxy|> iirc
<hesperaux> android could be ported to that
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<hesperaux> i'm not sure how the double processor thing would play out though
<hesperaux> that is really weird
<Galaxy|> 729MHz PowerPC
<MuzerNtbk> you'd need to make a "reverse IOS"
<MuzerNtbk> for screen access
<MuzerNtbk> Starlet can't access the screen
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Galaxy|> !wb Wii Hardware
<hy> http://i.imgur.com/ZU9NQ.jpg
<IOS61> Wii Hardware: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wii_Hardware
<IOS61> == Nintendo Wii Hardware Summary ==
*hesperaux clicks
<y007ghg7> lol
<hesperaux> does the Wii have any headers/pinouts for JTAG or similar?
<MuzerNtbk> remember, Starlet = security, Broadway = end-user
<MuzerNtbk> hmm
<MuzerNtbk> it has GPIO pins
<MuzerNtbk> people have soldered stuff to them
<MuzerNtbk> like LCD screens
<hesperaux> neat
<Staraptorhawk> how are you
<Galaxy|> that'd be pretty neat to see Android ported to it
<MuzerNtbk> http://marcansoft.com/uploads/images/starlet_says_hi_2.jpg
<Galaxy|> the graphics portion would be a pain though
<hesperaux> dude, i want to do that
<MuzerNtbk> ^^ that's using GPIO
<|Shadow|> so many apple jokes
<hesperaux> i need to get over my fears of hurting my little wii
<|Shadow|> have u all see the ipone4 fanboy video?
<Galaxy|> Android on the Wii would be amazing
<MuzerNtbk> that was a Bootmii experiment
<mzaouar_> hey you guys :D
<mzaouar_> !rules
<IOS61> mzaouar_: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<y007ghg7> yes
<MuzerNtbk> before they managed to get anything running on Broadway
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: with BootMii as BOOT2 and a NAND backup you should be fine, and yes bot I know the rules dammit..
<IOS61> Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<MuzerNtbk> just type back!up
<|Shadow|> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL7yD-0pqZg
<hesperaux> hehe
<MuzerNtbk> or something
<MuzerNtbk> :P
<MuzerNtbk> back!up
<MuzerNtbk> yeah, that works
<Galaxy|> string compare ftl

<hesperaux> Galaxy|, well i was referring to soldering stuff to the GPIO
<Galaxy|> if you can figure out the mysteries of getting the hardware to work properly in *nix
<Galaxy|> then you'd be one important guy here
<hesperaux> i just googled GPIO wii, but it brought up wiikey. I do believe that's not allowed, right?
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<mzaouar_> guys can someone help me with installing neogamme permanently on the wii, not launch it from the sd card everytime? (im on 4.1 with hbc )
<hesperaux> i've never done hardware programming, or even advanced software programming for that matter
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, wiikey is a modchip, so no :P
<Galaxy|> mzaouar_ !rules
<MuzerNtbk> dunno why that came up for GPIO
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/Hollywood_GPIOs
<hesperaux> i've done some assembly language though, but have never actually used it on a piece of hardware
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, he has
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> i'll be starting with PIC assembly once I get my bench set up again (just moved a bit ago)
<mzaouar_> Galaxyl ok ok sorry, but the funny thing is wiibrew is linking to these tools so :/
<mzaouar_> dono
<MuzerNtbk> mzaouar_, that's usually a lot harder
<MuzerNtbk> you CAN run from USB if you want
<mzaouar_> !rules
<IOS61> mzaouar_: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
<MuzerNtbk> but running from the Wii itself is usually discouraged - risky and sometimes illegal
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: more power to you
<Galaxy|> the Wii development has been a bit stagnant lately
<Galaxy|> and Nintendo's silence and then emergence with yet another useless update has only made it more baron
<mzaouar_> MuzerNtbk in lebanon there are no rules concerning that so it is not illegal..
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, hmm, they don't actually tell you where the debug GPIOs actually are
<mzaouar_> (MuzerNtbk will a ~ 32 mb sd card help ? )
<Galaxy|> http://wiire.org/Wii/console/motherboard
<MuzerNtbk> well, it's usually difficult and dangerous running stuff directly from NAND
<MuzerNtbk> you can easily brick your Wii
<hesperaux> maybe what I'll do is try hacking my linksys router, then, if I am very successful at that, I can see if there's anything I can do for the wii
<mzaouar_> ok ok cool
<Galaxy|> hesperaux: that can easily be done via software lol
<MuzerNtbk> Galaxy|, they don't seem to mention GPIO there
<hesperaux> i wish I had two wiis
<Galaxy|> MuzerNtbk: yeah but it gives an idea of what the hardware is up close
<Galaxy|> its only changed slightly since 2007
<mzaouar_> MuzerNtbk how about putting it in internal storage ?
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, what can be done with software? (brb)
<Galaxy|> depending on your router model dd-wrt tomato openwrt etc
<MuzerNtbk> mzaouar_, internal storage IS NAND
<MuzerNtbk> you can put it on a USB drive easily
<mzaouar_> MuzerNtbk ok ok woops
<MuzerNtbk> just format it as FAT and lay it out the same as an SD card
<mzaouar_> k k will do thx
<mzaouar_> btw MuzerNtbk what's "WAD" ?
<MuzerNtbk> mzaouar_, a way of installing channels or other Wii software. We don't usually discuss them here unless there is a good reason to, as they are often used for piracy.
<|lucid|> LOL
<mzaouar_> MuzerNtbk k k sry, thanks anyways :D
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, oh i already have dd-wrt on it
<|lucid|> it fucking prints money lol
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, i'm talking about using the JTAG and serial pinouts found on most linksys (mine included) to control external devices via wifi
<Galaxy|> ah JTAG is pretty neat I haven't done that to mine but I need to learn how to fix one of my WRT54Gs
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, ah, nice
<Galaxy|> it had a bad flash
<Galaxy|> so it's not accepting any FW and it has stability issues
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, that sucks a lot..
<MuzerNtbk> my router I think has a serial debug port
<Galaxy|> its not dead that's the thing it works but its radio resets a lot
<hesperaux> you can probably unbrick it with a JTAG
<MuzerNtbk> don' think it has much else
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> Galaxy|, strange
<Galaxy|> yeah thought so too
<MuzerNtbk> dodgy hardware?
<hesperaux> MuzerNtbk, what router do you own?
<MuzerNtbk> My main router is an Un-DD-WRT-able Belkin, but two days ago I bought a Buffalo WHR-G300N v2
<MuzerNtbk> and I'm using it as a repeater with DD-WRT
<hesperaux> <3 dd-wrt
<hesperaux> i set up a repeater for my g/f
<hesperaux> it works so well
<MuzerNtbk> I'm connected via it now, it's great!#
<MuzerNtbk> though oddly enough DD-WRT on my device has a very weird problem
<Galaxy|> I might take my older WRT54G and make it into a Kismet Drone
<MuzerNtbk> half the pages of the web UI simply won't load
<MuzerNtbk> none of them are pages that I need, luckily
<MuzerNtbk> but it's rather odd
<Galaxy|> browser script blocking?
<hesperaux> MuzerNtbk, i've experienced that before
<hesperaux> after flashing the firmware again (after a 30-30-30), things were better
<hesperaux> check this out: http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/
<hesperaux> that's the kinda router I have
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, perhaps because I was too lazy to reset it :P
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> you have to do a 30-30-30 when you flash it, before AND after. it's very important
<hesperaux> believe me it does affect things
<Galaxy|> the nvram is a pita
<Galaxy|> sometimes it wont clear until 2-3 passes of that reset technique
<MuzerNtbk> 30-30-30 is a reset then?
<Galaxy|> 30 seconds holding reset 30 seconds holding without power 30 seconds holding with power
<MuzerNtbk> I'll have to give it a try
<MuzerNtbk> I'll try before the next flash
<Galaxy|> forces a clear of the NVRAM
<hesperaux> and remember you don't release the reset button at al during 90 seconds
<MuzerNtbk> it seems to work fine as it is other than that problem now
<hesperaux> you might see the router go through reset more than once. this is normal
<Galaxy|> should just build in a switch for that lol
<Galaxy|> instead of holding the button just flip a switch and wait 90 seconds
<hesperaux> that's true
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<Galaxy|> itd be a lot easier
<Galaxy|> that button is a pain to get at from the outside
<hesperaux> but you need to unplug power too
<Galaxy|> yep
<MuzerNtbk> I don't like the DD-WRT homepage though
<hesperaux> i usually use a pen
<MuzerNtbk> out-of-date crap :P
<hesperaux> some of it is
<MuzerNtbk> it said my router wasn't compatible, and I got worried
<hesperaux> there are conflicting messages on the site
<MuzerNtbk> but after googling, I found that it was
<MuzerNtbk> (the person who sold it to me assured me that it is compatible)
<hesperaux> the buffalo router?
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<MuzerNtbk> wouldn't it be easier anyway to just telnet in and do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvram
<MuzerNtbk> or wherever
<MuzerNtbk> rather than a 30-30-30
<hesperaux> yes
<hesperaux> you can do that too
<hesperaux> i don't know if that's the method, but you can use tenet
<hesperaux> telnet*
<hesperaux> my L key is lame
<Galaxy|> telnet or ssh
<Galaxy|> telnet is on by default iirc
<hesperaux> telnet
<hesperaux> ssh works too
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<MuzerNtbk> how do I enable ssh then?
<hesperaux> system administration or something like that
<hesperaux> in the services tab
<MuzerNtbk> anyway, this is getting very offtopic now, lol :P
<hesperaux> >_> yes
<Galaxy|> i dont remember what files you need to backup / restore to get a properly functional wii again after using formatter
<IOS61> Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
<Galaxy|> iirc something like the shop certs are needed to use WiiConnect24
<Galaxy|> I haven't bought anything from the shop ever except free things so it doesn't really affect me
<hesperaux> i was going to disable WC24. Isn't that directed?
<Galaxy|> thus far nintendo hasn't abused their ability to use WC24 to do nefarious things
<Galaxy|> they could however do so
<MuzerNtbk> no code has been found that will be able to
<MuzerNtbk> but their EULA says they can
<Galaxy|> yep
<Galaxy|> meh its 5 am i need sleep lol
<Galaxy|> nite guys good luck hesperaux
<hesperaux> goodnight Galaxy|
<hesperaux> yeah I woke up at 4am today =/
<hesperaux> you must be in GMT-7
<Galaxy|> yep
<hesperaux> just moved from Arizona
<hesperaux> anyway, goodnight, thanks for your help
<Galaxy|> ha no DST there
<hesperaux> it's great =)
<MuzerNtbk> British Summer Time for me (GMT+1)
<Galaxy|> no problem
<hesperaux> british indeed
<MuzerNtbk> so it's 13:02 now
<hesperaux> it's 7am here
<hesperaux> i'm in Illinois, USA
<MuzerNtbk> that reminds me
<MuzerNtbk> I need lunch!
<|Shadow|> hesperaux, why u move from arizona?
<Galaxy|> that's a fairly big climate hange..
<Galaxy|> change*
<Galaxy|> hot and dry to hot and wet
<hesperaux> aright i'm gonna google around to see if I can find the GPIO on the wii
<hesperaux> well iw as born here, lived in AZ for 15 years
<MuzerNtbk> I used to live in Denmark when I was young
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<hesperaux> my parents live out here ,and my g/f. Switched schools to be with them
<|Shadow|> glad u moved
<|Shadow|> that racist state
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, #wiidev might be interesting
<hesperaux> oh god lol
<|Shadow|> then fucking repiublicans
<hesperaux> i stand by the legislation, but let's not get into #politics
<MuzerNtbk> hesperaux, that's a good channel for hardware hacking
<hesperaux> MuzerNtbk, roger that
<|Shadow|> so your a racist too
<hesperaux> yes, and I hate my mexican brother-in-law very very much
<hesperaux> just cuz he's mexican ;)
<MuzerNtbk> lol

<|Shadow|> shitty tv then
<[Hideki]> hrm, it's ifne on the VGA input
<|Shadow|> i have a 19 and it looks better
<[Hideki]> hrm
<Ottoman2> when the fron fascia panel is removed from the Wii, and the small plug comes out (with black and red wires) - is the only purpose of the wires to power the LED lights? or do they serve any other purpose?
<|Shadow|> no clue
<|Shadow|> never needed to open my wii
<[Hideki]> if it is the TV, he's getting it back, heh
<|lucid|> what brand TV

<Skylands> 10Meep
<^Wulfgar^> you convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager and use a fat32 usb hdd
<^Wulfgar^> no need for wbfs formatted drive
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14:>
<Animals> looks like cfgloader can read .iso's too
<Animals> right?
<RememberW> so i move the wbfs file to my hdd and load it thats all ?

*eXAKR hides
<RememberW> wbfs have low prefrance than iso i mean iso loads faster
<^Wulfgar^> no
<RememberW> am i right i dont know if i am
<Animals> juse pick one and use it :)
<^Wulfgar^> a .wbfs file is an iso with padding and update removed
<RememberW> ok
<RememberW> just one more thing
<RememberW> how can i burn a doul lyer dvd
<RememberW> just like a normal dvd ?
<^Wulfgar^> why burn if you have a usb hdd?
<RememberW> i am just asking
<Animals> yea, you can burn a dual layer dvd with imgburn
<Animals> if there is a layer break, make sure you specify it, or open the .dvd file
<RememberW> my sister cant read english well so usb is a hard chosie for her
<Animals> not really sure what you are tryin to burn
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14.
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas slaps eXAKR around a bit with a large trout
<^Wulfgar^> wtf does reading english have to do with usb?
<Animals> ive never had much luck with dl dvd's and the wii....sometimes they work, sometimes not
*eXAKR dies
<RememberW> she is stupid she cant plug the use in hdd
<Animals> but yea, you dont have to be able to read english to use a usb loader, its just pictures and crap
<RememberW> damn do i have to say this
<eXAKR> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGame
<RememberW> i cant give her my hdd
<Aurora> you just lost it
<eXAKR> YAY!
*eXAKR hides
<RememberW> animals dont know what did u mean by layer break
<^Wulfgar^> most dual layer games have a specific layer break
<RememberW> when i want to burn a dvd i open the iso with imbburn then just click burn
<Animals> usually a dual layer iso comes with a .iso, and a .dvd file
<Animals> the .dvd file specifies the layer break
<^Wulfgar^> Animals, most 360 games come with a .dvd...not all wii games do
<RememberW> iso dont ?
<Animals> so, if there is a .dvd file (which there should be), make sure you open that file with imgburn, not the .iso file
<Animals> ^Wulfgar^: yea, the only one ive downloaded is ssbb, and it had a .dvd
<Animals> but if there is no layer break, then great
<RememberW> oh i dont have the dvd file
<RememberW> i downloaded the iso for nothing :S
<Animals> nah, just burn the iso then, wulfgar said there isnt always a layer break
<Animals> what game is it
<RememberW> samurai 3
<Animals> yea dunno about that one...if there wasnt a .dvd, then just burn the .iso i guess
<Animals> should work
<RememberW> the size is nearly 7gb
<Animals> yea, you need a dual layer dvd to burn it
<RememberW> ok i will try it in my hdd first
<Animals> yea, if you have an hdd, just use that, will save you the hassle
<RememberW> thnx animals and wulfgar :D
<Animals> sure

<Preyer> Hey, I thought about using WiiScu to update (mainly) my ShopChannel
<Preyer> Do I need to select anything else than just update Shop Channel? (for example IOS61?)
<Preyer> Or should I maybe just update everything
<Sneas> 03hi
<Skylands> 10Hi Quil
<Quilava> hi
<eXAKR> http://kotaku.com/5587640/okamis-ds-sibling-goes-overboard-with-its-collectors-edition
<tpw_rules> update the shop channel should automatically install the ios it needs
<Preyer> Okey, thanks
<Aurora> 6wow

<eXAKR> http://kotaku.com/5587374/sir-our-weapons-are-useless-against-that-dog
<eXAKR> And Roara I knew you could want that
<Preyer> Didn't work, but installed IOS61 after that and then it worked
*sally yawns
<Proto> wb sally :)
<sally> thank you :o
<Proto> Welcome :D
<sally> i had a weird dream!!!
<MuzerNtbk> well, that's good then
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Proto> :O
<MuzerNtbk> I think the preferred way is with DopMii
<MuzerNtbk> (I might be wrong though)
<sally> lol you were there
<sally> except you were you x)
<Proto> heh
<sally> were not**
<sally> lol it was really weird
<sally> everyone we talked to yesterday was there
<sally> i think
<sally> lol x) it was so weird. it was like a game inside of a game.
<Proto> :D
<zc00gii> ohai =P

<sally> lol just when it started getting interesting someone was calling my phone so i woke up
<Jinx_Dojo> If I buy a new black Wii in store today, will it be running version 4.2?
<MuzerNtbk> zc00gii, Gentoo > *
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: I've used it for a few years
<zc00gii> it's aight I guess
<^Wulfgar^> possibly
<sally> x] were you the one watching star trek?
<zc00gii> still
<^Wulfgar^> it definately won't play dvd-r

<Proto> yes
<MuzerNtbk> what? You're not thrilled at being able to optimise for your CPU?
<MuzerNtbk> what's WRONG with you?
<Jinx_Dojo> no?
<sally> xD then i blame you!
<zc00gii> lolwut
<Jinx_Dojo> hrm
<Proto> :D
<zc00gii> I compile kernels all the time
<^Wulfgar^> no... usb > * anyhow
<Jinx_Dojo> what if i get the old model?
<sally> lol it had a star trek theme to it
<Jinx_Dojo> the one that's going for $150 now
<^Wulfgar^> just get a wii and usb hdd
<zc00gii> like, if I'm bored, I compile a kernel
<MuzerNtbk> um
<MuzerNtbk> not just kernels
<sally> except we were like...the characters of chrystal chronicles x)
<MuzerNtbk> everything
<sally> ooo and i think sonic
<zc00gii> that's like the only thing you can optimize for your CPU
*Andres is all sleepy D:
<sally> x)
<Jinx_Dojo> i have a USB HDD... can the Wii mods read extended partitions?
<MuzerNtbk> WRONG
<Sneas> 03.o
<zc00gii> RIGHT
<sally> <.<
<^Wulfgar^> no
<MuzerNtbk> -O2 -march=core2 -msse4_1 makes all the difference when compiling *ANY* program
<Andres> Hi, Sally!
<sally> hi >.>
<Jinx_Dojo> k, i'd have to reformat it then i guess :)
<Proto> sonic :D
<MuzerNtbk> (that's for my particular processor)
<sally> yes
<zc00gii> mmm, may start using gentoo again]
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<zc00gii> what the hell, that'll be my project for today
<sally> lol i cant explain it w/ out sounding really weird
<zc00gii> but damn
<zc00gii> I have no partition to install it on
*Andres keeps losing conciousness <.<
<Jinx_Dojo> so what you're saying is, current editions of the Wii require a hardware mod if I wanted to play from DVD+/-r?
<zc00gii> mmmm
<zc00gii> I need to install gparted on a USB disk
<MuzerNtbk> For CPU-intensive tasks like audio/video encoding, etc., it really does make one hell of a difference
<sally> wake up
<zc00gii> I need to find my flash drive, brb
<^Wulfgar^> new wiis will not read dvd-r... even with a hardmod
<Athenon> i dont need no fancy processor for no word processing son
<sally> but YEAH
<sally> it was weird
<Jinx_Dojo> silly question but... you're not making distinguishment between dvd-r and dvd+r right?
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: it's been a few years, mind helping me up with gentoo?
<zc00gii> the documentation is ugly
<^Wulfgar^> wii uses dvd-r
<Andres> I'll try to get some rest.
<sally> there was an alternate universe :OOO
<Proto> :O
<sally> hey, you cant sleep yet.
<Sneas> 03bbl
<Andres|Napsleepstuff> Why not? :o
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14hi and k
<sally> i'm not done w/ the story!
<Proto> :O
<Jinx_Dojo> alright so it won't read any non-pressed DVD media period?
<sally> ahemz
<Andres|Napsleepstuff> I'll read it later :o
<^Wulfgar^> duh
<Kyu> 07o3o
<sally> nooo just 4 seconds lol
<Jinx_Dojo> ha
<sally> all i remember is something about 3 of yall
<sally> i dont remember who
<MuzerNtbk> the documentation is easy
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<Jinx_Dojo> forgive my apparent ignorance, but, despite years in the emulation scene, I never actually modded a console
<sally> came back to where ever the heck we were acting funny
<MuzerNtbk> http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml
<Proto> heh
<sally> <o< and so
<Athenon> i tried gentoo once, but it failed miserably
<MuzerNtbk> ^^ for 32-bit
<Athenon> although, this was like a decade or so ago
<Jinx_Dojo> (you can't really count DreamCast)
<^Wulfgar^> emulation != console
<MuzerNtbk> http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml
<sally> proto myself and andres
<MuzerNtbk> ^^ for 64-bit
<sally> and aristeo
<Jinx_Dojo> indeed, but those interested in one field often share interest in the other :)
<MuzerNtbk> presumably that's what you're looking at, zc00gii?
<sally> figured something out and i dont remember the rest :o
<sally> lol x)
<Jinx_Dojo> anyway, thank you for the information today
<sally> i remember somone asked if they have played some kind of game befor
<sally> e
<MuzerNtbk> mine has been compiling KDE for the past few hours, anyway :P
<MuzerNtbk> can't wait to try it
<MuzerNtbk> I'll need to configure X first though...
<zc00gii> ewwwwwww
<tpw_rules> http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/RTFM.JPG (not related to any conversation here, just found it)
<Jinx_Dojo> i've got no problem with using my USB HDD... i'm just a bit concerned about spending the money on the console/hardware and finding out i bought an unmoddable version or somehow bricking it
<sally> then i remember something about shadow land and zero wrath
<zc00gii> KDE sucks balllz
<lukegb> <_<
<sally> hi dark truth
<lukegb> NO KDE IS AWESOME
<^Wulfgar^> all current wiis are softmoddable
<tpw_rules> both are nice
<sally> and
<Proto> Hey DarkTruth
<^Wulfgar^> just the new (black) wii can't read backups
<sally> then my weird dream changed do something
<sally> really weird.
<DarkTruth> hey everyone
<zc00gii> ZOMG I CAN MAKE MAH DEKSTOP SPIINZX CUBEZ!!111 AND LOOK AT HOW THIS IS ALL SHINEY....ZOMG THERES FISHSTIX IN THAR
<Proto> lol sally
<sally> and some guy
<^Wulfgar^> and if you can READ and FOLLOW directions, the softmod guides here are pretty fool proof
<Proto> this is an interesting dream so far xD
<DarkTruth> eww guys :X
<sally> was spazing out
<Jinx_Dojo> black and white right?
<zc00gii> all I need is a quick tiling WM
<sally> and uber happy
<zc00gii> which is awesome
<sally> that he was sleepinig w/ me o.o
<zc00gii> literally....awesomewm =P
<sally> not like sex
<^Wulfgar^> the d3-2 chipset can't read backups
<zc00gii> might switch to stumpwm though
<tpw_rules> lol
<Proto> DarkTruth, lol
<Jinx_Dojo> read & follow; that i can do :)
<sally> but actually sleeping lol
<MuzerNtbk> I don't use compiz really
<Proto> We're not all bad :<
<tpw_rules> what's tiling?
<dunedude> what about bleed and wallow?
<MuzerNtbk> I use KDE because KDE apps > other apps
<tpw_rules> in the context of window managers
<sally> the end.
<sally> lol
<^Wulfgar^> obviously not...I said 'black' wii and you mention the white one
<tpw_rules> MuzerNtbk: yes
<zc00gii> still, are you using all of those school shit and all of that other useless shit?
<MuzerNtbk> I hate plasma with a passion, but it doesn't stop me using KDE
<Kenshou`> americans.. americans
<Jinx_Dojo> uh yeah, because the new edition (chipset) is obviously in both colors
<Jinx_Dojo> no?
<dunedude> Wulfgar don't take shit from nobody, he smacks his wife around
<lukegb> urgh, plasma <_<
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<lukegb> I DON'T WANT PLASMOIDZ
<Kenshou`> everything is always black/white with you people
<MuzerNtbk> plasma IS a bug
<^Wulfgar^> dunedude, no I don't
<tpw_rules> ?
<MuzerNtbk> that needs to be fixed
<sally> andres|napsleepstuff!
<Jinx_Dojo> i'm hardly providing shit :)
<Ex0du5> Im about to softmod my first Wii, can someone tell me the safest place to get the files? I dont trust the people on YouTube..
<dunedude> she, he don't take shit from nobody
<^Wulfgar^> the new chipset was released in late aug last year
<tpw_rules> what's plasma?
<zc00gii> tpw_rules: it isn't a rule, but generally tiling and stacking means it has no top bar with an X or minimize or anything, and also, no windows behind eachother(which is floating) and it snaps together
<^Wulfgar^> Ex0du5, type ? softmod and follow the appropriate guide
<dunedude> that's all you got jinx, is shit
<tpw_rules> ohh
<Ex0du5> Thank you
<Ex0du5> ? softmod
<MuzerNtbk> plasma is a bit like explorer.exe in windows, only with fewer jobs
<Ex0du5> Should I update before modding? Ive heard mixed opinions on that..
<zc00gii> emacs has it's own way of stacking and tiling tho =P but it is nice how I can have emacs and blender up and running really easily
<Jinx_Dojo> dunedude: ?
<^Wulfgar^> NO
<zc00gii> I have no filemanager except for a terminal =P
<^Wulfgar^> NEVER do an N update
<MuzerNtbk> it controls taskbar (panel), desktop, and start menu (launcher, or whatever they're calling it nowadays). That's all.
<jwash> get yourself to 4.1 and stay there, use safe updaters
<tpw_rules> oh
<tpw_rules> why does it need to die?
<MuzerNtbk> zc00gii, Dolphin contains a built-in terminal that follows you around
<zc00gii> tpw_rules: stacking is awesome
<^Wulfgar^> jwash, the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide does that
<Ex0du5> Safe updaters?
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: yes, and it sucks and is annoying
<MuzerNtbk> tpw_rules, buggy, crashy, bloated piece of shit
<Ex0du5> Oh ok, thanks
<^Wulfgar^> Ex0du5, just FOLLOW THE GUIDE
<MuzerNtbk> zc00gii, no, it's good.
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: dolphin takes too much room
<tpw_rules> is it like nautilus except crashier?
<zc00gii> I like JUST a terminal
*Jinx_Dojo sighs.
<MuzerNtbk> zc00gii, do you have an 800x600 monitor?
<sally> Proto: do you have a facebook?
<zc00gii> tpw_rules: no no, nautilus is like dolphin.....
<MuzerNtbk> it looks fine for me even when I'm using my second monitor at 1024x768
<Proto> nope
<tpw_rules> oh
<sally> why? :o
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: no, but I have a blender window and emacs window up all the fucking time
<Jinx_Dojo> i really don't know what's wrong with just having a civil conversation
<Proto> Just don't
*zc00gii <3 awesome
<jwash> nothing
<sally> mkay
<MuzerNtbk> zc00gii, well get multiple fucking monitors then
<jwash> just don't be surprised, this is IRC
<sally> where is a boy?
<zc00gii> MuzerNtbk: I have no money :(
<MuzerNtbk> or multiple regular monitors if you can't afford the fucking variety
<^Wulfgar^> Jinx_Dojo, I provided the info you requested... repeating/rephrasing your questions won't change my answers
<LO_KEY> lol, youll find you cant really try to educate yourself in here with general questions.
<tpw_rules> This troper aliases the man command (which displays manual pages) to rtfm in all his Unix shell profiles.
<tpw_rules> lol
<Proto> which boy? lol
<zc00gii> lol
<MuzerNtbk> sure, I bet you could find a 1024x768 LCD for practically nothing
<sally> where
<dunedude> guy wants to have a dialogue about wii hacking, lol
<sally> lol
<MuzerNtbk> also, Gentoo is awesome because of this quote:
<Jinx_Dojo> LO_KEY: thank you for that advice :)
<jwash> each keystroke costs on calorie, and people don't like getting skinny
<sally> is where a boy
<MuzerNtbk> "Do not be afraid of the developers who are assigned to (your) bugs -- they generally don't eat people." <-- Gentoo Handbook
<tpw_rules> MuzerNtbk: i got one for $10 at a yardsale :D
<where> wat
<Jinx_Dojo> ^Wulfgar^: You actually never answered whether or not the old model is able to play DVD backups
<sally> lol nvm
<^Wulfgar^> yes I did
<sally> oh
<Proto> oh
<Proto> haha
<sally> are you a boy?
<Jinx_Dojo> but yes, you did provide me with information. I don't see how i rephrased any question--but that's your issue, not mine
<where> Are you a girl?
<sally> yes
<Jinx_Dojo> [124129] <Jinx_Dojo> what if i get the old model?
<Jinx_Dojo> [124145] <@^Wulfgar^> just get a wii and usb hdd
<MuzerNtbk> tpw_rules, I got one for £100 at Currys, but I bought it a couple of years ago as a general purpose display for all my old consoles/computers and DVD player (which it has built-in)
<Kyu> 07o3o
*where shows sally of his pretty dresses
<tpw_rules> nice
<^Wulfgar^> and did I not say that the 'new' wiis can't read backups?
<where> :q
<dunedude> hehe, dude is getting snippy
<tpw_rules> it isn't a tv though, so i found an rca -> vga converter for free
<where> I am male though.
<DarkTruth> o_O
<where> And I don't own any dresses :p
<MuzerNtbk> basically, when I'm not using it for any of those (ie most of the time), I use it as a second monitor
<DarkTruth> good
<Proto> lol DarkTruth
<sally> ohkaaay
<DarkTruth> lool
<where> Although i wish I did D:
<where> Skirts are so comfy.
<where> Don't ask how I know that >.>
<Jinx_Dojo> saying "black cats have fleas" doesn't give me any idea as to whether or not "orange cats have fleas"
<tpw_rules> right now it's just on my desk acting as a display for my wii
<LO_KEY> Jinx_Dojo: if you get an old model then you can utilize both dvdr backups (+ and -) as well as usb loading.
*sally wasnt going to
<DarkTruth> yea neither was I :P
<tpw_rules> i have 2 + laptop displays on my desk right now
<dunedude> your cat plays wii?

<DarkTruth> that might help
<Reshiram> 6 8 of which are event only

<DarkTruth> doubtful .... j//k :P
<Reshiram> 6you can chain about 40% of the pokemon in the games

<Proto> I even spelled like crap to get it in intime

<DarkTruth> I am so impatient, I want my new CPU and case to get here already :X

<DarkTruth> so I saved $60
<Proto> nice
<drf|work> no...
<DarkTruth> but I ordered it sunday D:
<drf|work> it used to be articuno.co.uk and lugia.co.uk
<Proto> I still lean towards AMD simply for power vs price
<DarkTruth> yea I love AMD
<DarkTruth> but I currently have intel stuff so I am sticking with it
<Proto> 3.6ghz, like 1.5gb video card, 16gb ram for <$2200
<Proto> yeah
<DarkTruth> I got a intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 for $139
<kurolink> both would redirect to the same site tho ?
*sally pant pant

<DarkTruth> who throws away something like that ?
<DarkTruth> people are so stupid
<Proto> lol
<drf|work> but no it hasn't always been the same domain name
<drf|work> because it was never .us
<kurolink> nice i see you have a redirect for both of those to the new domain
<drf|work> until a couple years ago
<Proto> sally, a forum :P
*TimeShift facepalms

*DarkTruth eats people they are tasty :3
<Proto> that person was stupid D:
<people> x) i dont know what tht stuff is up there ^^^
<drf|work> Articuno got them back, but that's not the point, the domain name changed
<Proto> haha DarkTruth
<people> nor have i heard of it
<people> o.O
<DarkTruth> nom nom >_>
*people double takes
<TimeShift> -> [...]relocatings and a domain change <- what I just wrote
<kurolink> btw drf|work what did you think of the announcement of live caster for black and white
*people sees the word eat :o
<Airwolve> .uk is the tld
<Airwolve> .co is not part
<sally> nonsense
<TimeShift> .co.uk is the tld - you get both in combination
<drf|work> TimeShift	it's always been the same domain name, <-- orly
<sally> i havnt had my daily dose of fruit roll-ups yet
<DarkTruth> o_o
<Proto> I have had a ham sandwich today
<TimeShift> yeah drf, it's always been lugia
<Proto> that's all :<
<kurolink> oh great look what i started :P
*sally stares at the empty box of fruit roll-ups
<drf|work> eh
<drf|work> if you wanna get technical
<TimeShift> lugia.us versus lugia.co.uk
<DarkTruth> I had some of myself
<DarkTruth> >_<
<drf|work> I consider lugia.us and lugia.co.uk two different domain names
*kurolink sighs and gets himself a soda
<Proto> o_O
<TimeShift> as I said - only the tld changed
<Reshiram> 6lugia.co.uk is the site I originally joined at
<sally> you had some of yourself
<Proto> bite a finger trying to eat a sandwich D:
<Reshiram> 6I was never active though
<drf|work> otherwise why would I have had to pay for 3 domain names when I got drfsupercenter.info, drfsupercenter.com and drfsupercenter.net?
<DarkTruth> lol
*sally stares at that sentence
<drf|work> if they're the same domain name?
<sally> interesting
<drf|work> most people look at domain names as the entire URL, not just the part before the period
<DarkTruth> yea that could be taken wrong in some ways
<TimeShift> because they're three different tld?
<DarkTruth> if your that perverted
<TimeShift> you're paying the the tld
<drf|work> you don't pay for a TLD though
<Proto> heh
<sally> lol uh huh
<drf|work> wtf
<sally> i mean o.o what?
<Proto> See, I only thought about you biting yourself
<sally> <.< >.>
<DarkTruth> yea
<sally> <___< heh
<DarkTruth> I meant like my body consuming itself cause I have not eaten :P
<drf|work> well aren't you one to get technical on me

<drf|work> anyway, whether we're talking domain names or TLDs
<drf|work> it was never originally lugia.co.uk
<zc00gii> wouldn't boot :|
<drf|work> it was always articuno.co.uk back when I joined
<iscooking> LMAO
<drf|work> and it was called The Iceberg of Articuno
<iscooking> that's so hawt
<lukegb> WELL DUH
<drf|work> I remember being mad when the name changed
<MuzerNtbk> real hackers use a hex editor to partition their drive
<lukegb> there was probably a reason for that check :P
*iscooking sprints downstairz para more bacon!!
<kurolink> can't you do a way back machine search on all this
<TimeShift> http://www.lugia.us/site-history.htm
<drf|work> try it
<Airwolve> to make it explicit, the second-level domain was always (if we ignore drf) "lugia", and only the top level domain has changed
<zc00gii> nah, it was a faulty check
<zc00gii> soo uhh
<iscooking> lol
<zc00gii> it's partitioned wrong
<zc00gii> right now it's only /dev/sdc, no sdc1
<Airwolve> well, the third level has been dropped, but I don't know if most people would actually count www.
<zc00gii> how do I fix that mother fucker?
<iscooking> i got threatened to be stabbed by a bent fork
<drf|work> August 2004 - The Iceberg of Articuno emerges as a simple html and php website. <-- that's about when I joine

<Proto> D:
<drf|work> And I remember Articuno making a big deal out of buying the lugia.co.uk domain name
*Proto protects iscooking
<drf|work> so I know for a fact it was not always that
<lukegb> Use parted?
<sally-willbecookingsoon> lol
<sally-willbecookingsoon> cx nummeh baco
<zc00gii> idk how to use parted
<sally-willbecookingsoon> bacon**
<drf|work> I haven't even typed it in forever
*drf|work runs
<lukegb> Also, some memory sticks DON'T have partition tables, they just put the fs on the normalness
<drf|work> I just type l and hit tab a few times in Firefox
<sally-willbecookingsoon> thank you oh great protector
<drf|work> and history does the rest
<Proto> :3
<lukegb> Others still do.
<lukegb> Some motherboards will only boot off those with partition tables, others won't.
<kurolink> ?
<sally-willbecookingsoon> o.O
<zc00gii> well
<zc00gii> it did have a partition table
*sally-willbecookingsoon remembered there is chocolate ice cweam in the fridge

<kurolink> anyways a wayback search turns up nothing
<kurolink> other than a data retrieval error

<drf|work> We're sorry. We were unable to retrieve the requested data. We may be experiencing technical difficulties and suggest that you try again later.

<TimeShift> of course she does
<Reshiram> 6kuro, she's on a lot
<lukegb> I don't want to play tetris in vim or flip bytes
<Reshiram> 6but looks like she's at work right now
<drf|work> Reshiram, LOL fail
<lukegb> I want to bloody edit files
<lukegb> IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
<Reshiram> 6how is that fail?
<drf|work> so hmm
<drf|work> here's what you do
<drf|work> take the plug where the AC plugs in
<drf|work> get a really long extension cord
<drf|work> run it over to the neighbor's house
<drf|work> :)
<zc00gii> what about a shell? what about slime inspection? what about an IRC client?
*drf|work hides
<Reshiram> 6we have a built in AC

<kurolink> i think i'll hang here for abit then until she comes back from work i want to ask her a few things about the site
<lukegb> I don't want to play tetris in vim or flip bytes
<drf|work> OK fine, go buy a fan
<drf|work> and do that
<lukegb> I want to bloody edit files
<Proto> hehe
<Reshiram> 6we're not going to buy another AC just so we have an external
<lukegb> IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
<Proto> it's okay
<drf|work> OW MY EYES
<sally-willbecookingsoon> you wldnt want my germs
<Reshiram> 6we have a fan
<drf|work> @ that yellow
<zc00gii> <zc00gii> what about a shell? what about slime inspection? what about an IRC
<zc00gii> 	 client?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14xD
<TimeShift> I start to understand why the american electricity system is so f****ed up :)
<drf|work> Yes, it's all my fault
<Reshiram> 6lol
<kurolink> fans are over rated
<drf|work> the entire country
<drf|work> because of me.
*drf|work runs
<lukegb> I don't want to play tetris in vim or flip bytes or use a shell (apart from the : command) or inspect slime OR GO ON IRC
<lukegb> I want to bloody edit files
<drf|work> I actually don't do that
<lukegb> IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
*TimeShift trips drf
<drf|work> my parents aren't poor, so yeah
<drf|work> heck
<sally-willbecookingsoon> all dooone
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<drf|work> generally we're the one letting people mooch
<MuzerNtbk> I can use a shell in nano
<drf|work> when the power goes out
<MuzerNtbk> :P
<drf|work> as we have a generator
<zc00gii> lukegb: uhhhh
<Reshiram> 6its fun when the power goes out in our neighborhood
<zc00gii> slime inspection is fucking awesome
<kurolink> so articuno is her handle on the irc as well ?
<Reshiram> 6we don't have generators, so we have to make do without stuff
<drf|work> We're like the only ones with power
<zc00gii> you highlight a function, and takes you to the definition
<TimeShift> funny, I've seen a blackout once. It was in 1995 I think
<drf|work> that's stupid
<Reshiram> 6we all go to the neighbor's pool
<drf|work> no electricity is fail
<drf|work> No IRC = :(
*drf|work runs
<lukegb> Wow
<drf|work> the thing is
<lukegb> I have a memory for that
<drf|work> we usually have the power go out for like a week
<drf|work> in the middle of winter
<Reshiram> 6I've been in several blackouts
<drf|work> no heat = FFS
<drf|work> so we eventually just bought a 16kW generator
<drf|work> to power most of the house off of
<drf|work> runs on natural gase
<drf|work> -e
<Reshiram> 6we've never had blackouts in winter, always summer
<TimeShift> one blackout in 30 years, lasting 15 minutes. So what? :)
<drf|work> we have all the computers, TVs etc
<Reshiram> 6our area has rolling blackouts for the summer heat
<drf|work> Reshiram, what would make the power go out for the summer?
<drf|work> *in
<Reshiram> 6AC
<drf|work> It always goes out due to snowstorms here
<drf|work> ....
<Reshiram> 6everyone in the state using it
<MuzerNtbk> meh
<drf|work> usually the power goes out when stuff falls on power lines
<Reshiram> 6power shortage
<drf|work> not overuse LOL
<MuzerNtbk> most IDEs do that anyway
<Kyu> 07lol
<kurolink> so what theme did everyone choose i think i like shadow lugia the best
<drf|work> so if it's like a blizzard out
<drf|work> I use the original theme
<zc00gii> lukegb: uhh, what about builtin functions?
<zc00gii> or library functions?
<Reshiram> 6we haven't had one in a couple years, but I remember the news reports warnign us of rolling outages because of a power shortage
<kurolink> tho deep ocean lugia looks kinda cool
<lukegb> WHAT ABOUT EDITTING FILES
<zc00gii> what about a fucking package manager for libraries?
<lukegb> I WANT TO EDIT MY FILES
<TimeShift> may I recommend putting photovoltaic cells onto the roofs of your houses to power the ACs with them? ;)
<lukegb> WHY CAN'T I EDIT FILES
<Reshiram> 6I'm on random theme
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<zc00gii> in emacs you can edit files too
<kurolink> Zapdos just hurts my eyes
<lukegb> ARGH FEATURE CREEP
<Reshiram> 6My family can't afford it here
<drf|work> well either way
<drf|work> we usually have power outages in the winter
<drf|work> and the people who work for the power plant are retards
<drf|work> so it takes them like a week to fix it
<Reshiram> 6but if we wind up putting a pool in, we'll be having solar panels for it
<drf|work> so we just said F it and bought a generator
<kurolink> fun... <.<
<drf|work> the thing I wonder
<drf|work> how come no matter how bad the weather is
<drf|work> the natural gas never goes out? LOL
<drf|work> as that's what runs the generator
<kurolink> i feel bad for people on solar power in the winter
<TimeShift> solar or photovoltaic?
<drf|work> why don't they just put the power lines right next tot he gas lines >_>
<Kyu> 07how can you not afford solar panels, but you can if you're going to also get a pool?
<MuzerNtbk> lol
<drf|work> affording, lame
<drf|work> go steal some
*drf|work runs
<TimeShift> you know there's a difference between both? :)
<kurolink> i take it color is allowed here in the IRC i ask because it's different everywhere i go
<Reshiram> 6because my stepmom's company just got bought by visa
<drf|work> LOL Visa
<drf|work> can you get me free credit cards?
*drf|work hides
<Reshiram> 6so we have a sudden large sum of money
<Reshiram> 6and blablablah parent talk
<drf|work> speaking of which
<drf|work> time to go scam trialPay
<Reshiram> 6so kyu, I have no idea
<Reshiram> 6:)
<kurolink> @drf|work how ?
<TimeShift> and drf - even if you have a credit card, you have to pay back what you buy with it :)
<drf|work> you know what TrialPay is?
<lukegb> zc00gii: so what's your favourite editor then? :P
<kurolink> yes
<drf|work> I HAVE a credit card
<drf|work> it's actually a debit card
<Reshiram> 6ugh credit cards
<drf|work> Visa Debit
<kurolink> ok
<drf|work> so much better than actual credit cards
<Reshiram> 6I have credit and debit
<drf|work> as I can't go in debt
<drf|work> but it works as a credit card
<drf|work> so it's win-win
<drf|work> anyway kurolink
<drf|work> what I do
<drf|work> is sign up for like, a free trial of Netflix
<drf|work> then cancel the trial
<kurolink> right
<drf|work> get the idea?
<drf|work> so I get toatlly free stuff
<drf|work> *ttoally
<drf|work> *TOTALLY
<kurolink> nice
<drf|work> that's how I got that mIRC key for TST users
<drf|work> and I need to get an Ad Muncher key for my sisters
<TimeShift> and the guys are happy having your data :)
<kurolink> i just use a program that makes the trial go forever
<drf|work> .......
<kurolink> runas date i think
<drf|work> TimeShift, um
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14>> 4WinAmp 14<> 12Eluveitie 14<> 3Slania - 2008 14<> 07Anagantios 1414<> 10Folk/Melodic Death Metal 14<<
<drf|work> TrialPay does not steal data
<drf|work> nor does Netflix
<drf|work> I'm not some paranoid
<drf|work> kurolink, yeah, that'll work but my sisters are fricking idiots
<kurolink> i got a free movie ticket from trialpay it was cool
<zc00gii> http://pastebin.com/dpKUfNS7
<drf|work> they didn't even know the difference between Windows XP and Windows 7
<zc00gii> lukegb: emacs
<zc00gii> but yeah
<zc00gii> I just did M-x psychoanalyze pinhead
<kurolink> Windows 7 is so much better than XP
<zc00gii> and that's the session I had with it =P
<drf|work> I was like "You don't notice it looks different?"
<drf|work> "Oh, that?"
<TimeShift> ...and they registered which movie you visited and possibly even which snacks and which size and flavour you picked
<drf|work> well
<kurolink> 7 is XP as Vista is to ME
<drf|work> I have no problem with XP'
<drf|work> I'm using it right now
<drf|work> but for computers that can run 7
<drf|work> then it's ncie
<TimeShift> plenty of data worth ten times more than the value of the ticket :)
<kurolink> ME was a huge fail
<drf|work> TimeShift, why do you assume every company is out to get you?
<drf|work> ever heard of the Better Business Bureau (sp)?
<kurolink> can you keep going for the same trial drf ?
<kurolink> or does trialpay track it some how ?
<zc00gii> oooh
<drf|work> for what, Netflix?
<drf|work> no
<zc00gii> that might be why it didn't boot
<drf|work> I never even use it
<drf|work> I just sign up and cancel
<zc00gii> I don't have syslinux installed
<kurolink> what happens when you run out of offers
<drf|work> then you're screwed
<lukegb> pacman away!
<TimeShift> drf - not a single company has money to give out for free
<drf|work> or you go get another credit card number :)
<TimeShift> especially NOT in america :)
<drf|work> TimeShift, so you assume they sell your data?:
<drf|work> that's just not true
<drf|work> the way TrialPay works
<drf|work> 1. ads
<drf|work> 2. you buy something, they get part of the revenue
<drf|work> and in turn they give you something free
<drf|work> I just abuse it when they let you use free trials of services
<zc00gii> yeah =D
<TimeShift> why sell if you can use the data yourself for market studies?
<zc00gii> lukegb: you use arch
<zc00gii> ?
<drf|work> what do you mean
<drf|work> they don't spam me...
<TimeShift> why spam you?
<drf|work> not to mention I use fake data anyway :P
<drf|work> I make up a name and address
<drf|work> and use a temporary email'
<drf|work> that I delete once I'm done
<drf|work> I fail to see your point
<TimeShift> ...and they have your IP and know you're not telling the truth
<drf|work> look up my IP right now
<drf|work> tell me what you saee
<drf|work> *see
<drf|work> it won't be my name ;)
<TimeShift> I doubt you're sitting in detroit by now :)
<Kyu> 07because they totally check every single person for any sign of suspicion
<lukegb> yeah :P
<drf|work> wait, what?
<drf|work> no I'm not in Detroit
<drf|work> and yeah, that
<drf|work> they really don't care
<lukegb> just not atm, because I need MSVC#
<TimeShift> oh do they?
<drf|work> I think TimeShift just likes trying to make a fool of me for no reason
<Kyu> 07well
<Reshiram> 6I think TimeShift is rather paranoid
<drf|work> TrialPay is actually an acredited company
<lukegb> BECAUSE SHARPDEVELOP ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH <_<
<drf|work> it's not like www.thissiteisnotascam.com
<drf|work> which, btw, is not a scam
*drf|work runs
<Reshiram> 6he brings this kind of stuff up every time you mention something of the sort
<Kyu> 07you can't spell drf|work without dork
*Kyu runs
<TimeShift> if you ever succeed reaching my age, we'll maybe continue talking about it, k?
<Reshiram> 6...
<drf|work> ...what are you implying
<drf|work> are you saying I'm gonna die in the next 10 years?
<TimeShift> did I say that?
<drf|work> then what did you mean by that
<TimeShift> now, who's paranoid here, eh? ;)
<Reshiram> 6what else COULD you mean by that?
<Airwolve> Or, he could be saying you'll age faster than the normal population and manage to catch him up
<Kyu> 07he's implying that because he's older he can assume he knows everything about a company he hasn't even used =P
<TimeShift> experience Kyu
<drf|work> yes because you totally live in America
<drf|work> just because you hate our country doesn't mean you know everything
<TimeShift> experience in business of a headhunter. Something I worked for about 5 years
<Reshiram> 6if you ever succeed reaching my age....that's rather obvious what you;'re saying
<drf|work> Not all businesses are evil
<Kyu> 07more like assumed stereotypes about american companies
<drf|work> Are you also saying sites like Amazon.com are going to use your for market studies?
<Kyu> 07lol drf
<TimeShift> you have no idea how much
<Kyu> 07bad example
<Kyu> 07because they do
<drf|work> LOL
<Reshiram> 6lol
<drf|work> do they?
<drf|work> they don't sell your info, at least
<Kyu> 07DUUUUUUUUUH
<kurolink> drf|work what kind of stuff can i get from trial pay
<drf|work> software
<TimeShift> they have an entire datacenter just analyzing what article you look at, how long, what area of the page you're looking, which links you click in which order, which buttons you miss and what you order in how many clicks and what combinations on what days and what times of the day
<drf|work> there's a huge list somewhere
<TimeShift> and PLENTY of other factors
<drf|work> yeah but who cares
<drf|work> Google does the same thing
<drf|work> does that mean you're gonna boycott searching?
<ath0> ? list
<TimeShift> the Data Mining toolkits of pages like Amazon were one of my computer sciences study topics
<drf|work> for that matter
<drf|work> iTunes does the same thing
<drf|work> more proof that Apple is evil :)
<TimeShift> look at how old Amazon is and how old iTunes is
<drf|work> LOLtiming
<Airwolve> actually to my knowledge google just looks at the content of what you click on then suggests you stuff
<drf|work> Airwolve, ever heard of Google Analytics?
<TimeShift> well, partly
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14LOL
<Airwolve> and they definitely keep stored data to an absolute minimum
<drf|work> not anymore
<Kyu> 07it's not like personal data of purchases even matters to the average person anyways, all that data collection is just to try to get them to buy more stuff
<drf|work> because the government is like, making them spy on people
<drf|work> Kyu, yeah
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14>> 4WinAmp 14<> 12Eluveitie 14<> 3Slania - 2008 14<> 07Slania's Song 1414<> 10Folk/Melodic Death Metal 14<<
<drf|work> and I just told Amazon not to bug me
<drf|work> besides receipts
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Epicness music right there
<TimeShift> Google was quite simple - it searches for keywords in relation linking to specific pages. If a page mentions this keyword close or within a link to another page, this linked page is noted as a possible result for this word
<Kyu> 07the only personal info that matters is for things like passwords
<TimeShift> the more possible results this page gets for a single word, the more likely is the match
<TimeShift> that's how Google works - essentially
<ath0> ? releases
<ath0> !releases
<Reshiram> 6that's common sense >_>
<TimeShift> and wanna bet Kyu?
<ath0> !openingwii
<drf|work> I still don't see how this has anything to do with how credible TrialPay is
<Reshiram> 6lol I was just thinking that
<Airwolve> also if you're so paranoid go yell at services like Yahoo email that have people trawling through your messages in order to decide on things like advertisements
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> Advertisements, pssh
<TimeShift> I don't use Yahoo :)
<drf|work> who even sees ads?
<drf|work> real pros use an ad blocker
<drf|work> I do, but that's not the point
<Airwolve> google just apply their search engine formula to the contents to give you suggestions
<drf|work> Yahoo mail is actually quite good, despite what people say
<Airwolve> so no-one sees your email with them
<drf|work> it has unlimited storage, for one
<drf|work> unlike gmail
<Airwolve> you mean
<Airwolve> "unlimited"
<TimeShift> ...which I also don't used
<drf|work> so what mail service do you use
<Kyu> 07if I buy something online and get a whole bunch of ads targeted at what they assume I like, then how harmful is it to anyone?
<Airwolve> try uploading a 500 GB HDD backup and see what they say
<drf|work> I mean, I have one throguh my ISP as well'
<Reshiram> 6some german site I bet

<ath0> !news
<drf|work> LOL Airwolve
<drf|work> 10MB max for attachments
<drf|work> AFAIK
<drf|work> but I have like 4000 emails
<drf|work> and it's not a problem
<Airwolve> so split it into 10MB partial .rars
<TimeShift> I have my own mail server and my IBM inbox for the rest?
<drf|work> LOL
<drf|work> I'm far too lazy for that
<drf|work> how about this, you email ME a bunch of partial rars
<drf|work> :P
<Airwolve> also gmail allow 25 MB, and the 7GB I have is more than enough
<TimeShift> why should I?
<drf|work> Did I say you, TimeShift?
<zc00gii> grrr
<zc00gii> I need the command "mcopy"
<drf|work> The thing I don't like about gmail
<zc00gii> lukegb: you have that command?
<drf|work> is they try to be MS Outlook in a web browser
<drf|work> I hate that stupid new Yahoo Mail interface, I disabled it
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> zu-zuXtimeshift here
<drf|work> I actually like just plain simple looking webmail
<Airwolve> and gmail isn't simple?
<Reshiram> 6I use gmail, it's simple to me, but meh
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hi airwolve ^^
<drf|work> it looks like Outlook, doesn't it?
<TimeShift> howdy zu-zu
<Airwolve> it's certainly no more like MS Outlook than any other email client
<Reshiram> 6yeah
<Airwolve> and hi
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hi timeshift
<drf|work> orly Airwolve
*Zu-ZuXtimeshift hugs timeshift
<lukegb> It's in mtools
*TimeShift hugs back
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> ^^
<drf|work> http://imgur.com/bOZ47.png
<drf|work> yes that TOTALLY looks like Outlook, don't you agree?
*drf|work hides
<drf|work> the *new* Yahoo mail does, I hate that
<Reshiram> 6so you put TimeShift's name into your own, but you don't have the courtesy to capitalize his name the way he wants
<Reshiram> 6I'm amazed he hasn't gotten on your case for that
<Airwolve> looks as much like it as gmail does, yes.
<Reshiram> 6he's done it for everyone else
<drf|work> I'm amazed I haven't banned her yet :)
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> lol
<drf|work> Airwolve, what/
<drf|work> *?
<drf|work> Screenshot it then
<TimeShift> I did it for those forgetting to capitalize the S whilst the T was correctly
<drf|work> because I haven't seen that
<drf|work> Timeshift
<drf|work> Timeshift
<drf|work> Timeshift
<Reshiram> 6drf, that looks a lot like gmail
<drf|work> Timeshift
<Reshiram> 6a LOT
<drf|work> LOOL
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> lol
<drf|work> hey, Cube did his job for him
<Kyu> 07lol
<TimeShift> either timeshift - everything lowercase - or TimeShift :)
<drf|work> how about timeShift
<drf|work> or TiMeShIfT?
<TimeShift> and drf, you're just made of fail. Would you please grow up? ;)
<Reshiram> 6pfth, proper name should be capitalized
<Reshiram> 6look who's talking
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> lol
<Kyu> 07lol
<Reshiram> 6didn't you do the same with the !define script?
<drf|work> wait what?
<Kyu> 07I know I did :D
*Kyu runs
<drf|work> OK WTF

<Sparky> 2hi Zu-
*Kyu places Sparky in a bucket
<Airwolve> http://www.arthi.org/ui/gmail/gmail_inbox.jpg <-- one someone else uploaded, I don't see how that's any closer to MS Outlook other than having thinner borders
<Sparky> 2O__o
*Sparky 2flails in the bukkit
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> lol
<drf|work> Because
<drf|work> when you click on an email
<drf|work> it opens below the list,r ight?
<drf|work> not in its own window?
<Reshiram> 6its own window
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> my friends must have theirs set up differently then
<Airwolve> it opens in the section that was the list
<Sparky> 2o-o
<Reshiram> 6not a new window, but the page changes from the list to the email itself
*Zu-ZuXtimeshift tikkles sparky
<drf|work> hm
<drf|work> well either way
<drf|work> I haven't really liked gmail's GUI
*Sparky 2flails more in the bukkit
<drf|work> I tried it back when it was invite on;y
<drf|work> and it was kinda annoying
<drf|work> *only
<Reshiram> 6LOL invite
<drf|work> I've had that yahoo email since I was like 10
<drf|work> and yeah
<Reshiram> 6I joined at that time too
<Airwolve> more explicitly the large iframe changes from the list to the email
<Sparky> 2it CAN open in a new window
<drf|work> guess who invited me
*Zu-ZuXtimeshift takes sparky out of the bukkit
<Reshiram> 6I still have 50 invites cuz it changed right after I joined
<drf|work> a guy from my ISP
*drf|work runs

<drf|work> white is so much better than black, serioiusly
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> i know
<drf|work> and I'm not being racist
*drf|work hides
<Airwolve> I have an email based on google but registered with a friend's domain, so I get a decent service and it doesn't look like a free one
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> i want black
<Quanyails> 7Whatever is the less favorite. o3o
<Reshiram> 6I woulda gotten white, until I leanred reshiram is in black
<Reshiram> 6learned
<drf|work> --- Quanyails is back <-- I misread that as black
*drf|work runs
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> i know
<Reshiram> 6but I also want zekrom, so ffff :|

<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hm
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hm
<drf|work> I just leave them
<Airwolve> I just dislike yahoo because it wastes so much space
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hm
<drf|work> unlimited storage, remember? :P
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> hm
<drf|work> what do you mean wastes space
<Airwolve> where google's is minimal
<MuzerNtbk> yeah
<MuzerNtbk> in mtools
<Airwolve> UI
<TimeShift> I'm wasting space by not using it?
<TimeShift> you call it a waste, I call it "keep a nice reserve just for the case"
<MuzerNtbk> what, you can't search a package by files in arch?
<Zu-ZuXtimeshift> lol
<MuzerNtbk> funny that, you can do it in Gentoo and Debian/Ubunti
<MuzerNtbk> *Ubuntu
<drf|work> http://imgur.com/xCoCo.png
<drf|work> that's my ISP's webmail
<Reshiram> 6the pessimist and at optimist
<drf|work> and I absoultely hate it
<drf|work> THAT looks like Outlook
<Reshiram> 6*the
<drf|work> and I thought gmail worked the same way
<MuzerNtbk> and in fact, in Ubuntu it's done automatically if you type in a nonexistant command
<drf|work> at least it does for my friend
<Reshiram> 6wow....never seen that for gmail
<Airwolve> I'm referring to the UI, there's plenty of space that isn't used for something useful and could be very easily
<drf|work> I have
<drf|work> maybe it's an option o.o
<drf|work> still, that's annoying, isn't it? LOL
<Reshiram> 6one I wont be using
<TimeShift> wow, you're getting lots of spam
<Reshiram> 6yeh
<drf|work> My ISP is like "It's a new fancy webmail"
<TimeShift> I get none ;)
<drf|work> and I'm like "I want the old one."
<Reshiram> 6thats not his email o-o

<Skylands> 10I suppose you're right Aurora, as rule 13 says: "No bringing up old topics that do not relate to this day and age. You may bring up old topics if they have died out and will be good to start again but if the topic concerns members or situations of the past, then it's quite pointless"
<Reshiram> 6if it stays dead, I'll lock it I guess
<Skylands> 10it relates to this day and age, so.. my mistake
<Reshiram> 6but as of now, it's still relevant
<drf|work> do we have a rule 43?

<DeepSeaLugia> 10No one talk now?
<Arcanine> 04the boss
<Arcanine> 04D:
<Quilava> you're at it?
<Arcanine> 04yes
<Brother> LLOTS; you got to admit god of war 3 has epic battle scenes

<Arcanine> 04and a fairy
<Arcanine> 04D:

*Proto shakes Stryker's hand respectfully, "Doctor."
<Stryker> o.o
<EpicStatsGuy> 4hey look it's a noob
<NightHawk> lol
*Stryker pokes Proto with a syringe.
*Proto dies

*Stryker injects Proto with ADAM.
<Brother> have you played it?
<Proto> :D
<sally> twas liquid 8424772
*Proto lives
<Curly> not EVE? :O
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14No and I don't want to
<Stryker> That wouldn't revive him, I don't think. :o
<Proto> It would not
<Curly> I still find it funny in Bioshock that the guy just randomly stabs himself with a huge needle he finds
<sally> minus one 7
<Stryker> Nor would ADAM, but I needed my Bioshock reference.
<Curly> a huge glowing needle
<Curly> EVE would have been a bioshock reference :O
<sally> doesnt like zelda something of time
<Stryker> Didn't Atlas totally tell him to? :O
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Ohai Tiel
<Tiel> hai~
<Stryker> "Steady now. Your DNA is just being rewritten."
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14PMzors?
<Proto> lol

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14k ^^
*sally waits
<Arcanine> 04damnit
<Arcanine> 04even with 12 total hearts i couldn't even phase him
<Quilava> yeah
<Quilava> I told you, that thing is insane
<Curly> I don't remember Atlas telling him to use the needle
<Curly> he just uses the needle and then Atlas says that
<Curly> also gigantic plot twist was gigantic :O
*Stryker quickly points out that she never finished the game.
<Stryker> Yet.
<Stryker> D:
<Curly> me neither
<Proto> I love that game
<Proto> Choice between good and evil
<Stryker> I prefer Bioshock 2, tbh.
<Proto> Never played
<Proto> I didn't even get bioshock until last year
<Curly> I want to finish Bioshock so I can play Bioshock 2
<Stryker> You don't have to.
<Curly> blah
<Curly> I want to
<Curly> besides
<Curly> maybe you're missing some references because you never finished the first one :O
<Stryker> Psh. :p
<Stryker> Possibly. :O
<Stryker> There is a trophy that I had to get that was a reference to the first game.
<SheenaFox> Afternoon, Lyon
<Stryker> I didn't know about it until after I finished it, though. ._.
<Quanyails> 7Hi, Lyon.
<Lyon> 04hey Sheena
<Lyon> 04hey Quan
*Quanyails 7pokes Lyon about AQ.
<Curly> see? :O
<Lyon> 04ohyes?
<Arcanine> 04i don't even know how to go about killing it
<Stryker> Just one!
*Lyon doesn't play it much anymore
<Stryker> D:
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quilava> you have to jump into the water and use zora magic shield
<Aeroslash> hi Quan
<Espeon> AQ as in adventure quest? That game that spawned a near infinite amount of clones?
<Stryker> Besides, that was on the consoles. :P You'd never notice it otherwise.
<Espeon> |3
<Lyon> 04lolEspeon
<Lyon> 04yes
<Quanyails> 7Clones, really?
<Espeon> lol great, it spawned all those clones popping up in ads
<Lyon> 04Quan
<Espeon> pretty much the same damn game just with new models
<Lyon> 04Dragonfable, AQ Worlds, Warpforce, etc
<Drake> 04hey Espeon
<Quanyails> 7Ahm, not exactly.
<Espeon> hey
<Quanyails> 7That's like saying D/P/Pt and HG/SS are clones.
<Espeon> well I NEVER played any of them so I call them clones :#
<Espeon> :3*
<Espeon> they look so similar... and well I have tried AQ but found it boring.
<Reshiram> 6in espeon's terms, DPPt and HGSS are clones
<Reshiram> 6just saying
<Quanyails> 7Because they use the same mechanics?
*Stryker looks around.
*Proto waves
<Lyon> 04tbh AQ is really the only one I've stuck with
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14gotta brb
<Stryker> I think I'll go play Colonization. D:
<Lyon> 04k
*Stryker wanders over to Steam.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14gotta brb all
<Proto> Bye Stitch[Gone]
<Drake> 04k
<Proto> Stryker*
<Reshiram> 6pretty much
<Espeon> there's a difference between a company using their own mechanics in a slightly improved/modified form and other companies pretty much creating "x Game! Now with... something new!" and releasing it as the best thing EVAR
<Tiel> hokie
<Quanyails> 7So... are you criticizing games not made by Artix Entertainment?
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Espeon> I just dislike how sooooo many browser games are so damn similar.
<Espeon> They're all just wanting people to buy PREMIUM FEATUREZ anyway.
*Espeon hides

<drfsupercenter> 03like they didn't even know the difference between Windows XP and 7
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm asking for Creideiki because of his/her (hmm?) knowledge in music.
<Aurora> 6bet my grandma is bigger
<Glacymr> 12crest is the biggest noobs ever
<drfsupercenter> 03but they tried using a Mac
<drfsupercenter> 03and were like
<drfsupercenter> 03WTF?
<drfsupercenter> 03so that's proof that Macs are NOT easier to use
<Glacymr> 12i was going to buy some of their white strips
*drfsupercenter runs
<Curly> or fall asleep while watching a movie :O
<Glacymr> 12until i saw the price
<Aurora> 6macs aren't easier to use
<drfsupercenter> 03well that's what they advertise
<Stryker> I WAS HIGHLIGHTED
<Stryker> WAI
<Aurora> 6if they were, I woulda figured it out immediately
<Andres> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03all their TV ads
<Stryker> RAEG
<drfsupercenter> 03are like, they're so much easier to use than PCs
<drfsupercenter> 03which is pure crap;
<Aurora> 6it took me a couple weeks
*Andres wubbles Strykah.
<Glacymr> 12drfsupercenter
<Stryker> o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I can do stuff fairly fine in OSX, I just hate it
*Stryker proddles Andres more.
<drfsupercenter> 03like
<drfsupercenter> 03if you have something windowed
<drfsupercenter> 03your stupid options
<Glacymr> 12you can do less with them than windows
<drfsupercenter> 03are way at the top
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm lazy
<drfsupercenter> 03and don't feel like doing that
<Glacymr> 12so in a way it is easier to use
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Proto> wb Stryker :)
<drfsupercenter> 03...LOL
*Andres thinks he will just go to sleep! :o
<drfsupercenter> 03By that logic, a brick is easier to use than both

*Stryker cries.
<Andres> k D:
<Glacymr> 12bricks ARE easier to use

*Stryker huggles Andres.
<drfsupercenter> 03through the office door of Steve Jobs?
*drfsupercenter hides
*Andres huggles back :o
<Glacymr> 12i heard this criminal tried robbing a jewery store
<Glacymr> 12by throwing a brick at their window to break his way in
<Glacymr> 12it was one of those strong windows that is meant to withstand heavy storms, so the brick bounced back and hit him, knocking him out quite effectively until police got there
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Glacymr> 12so i guess some people aren't smart enough to use bricks
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<drfsupercenter> 03I also know how to play euchre
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a stereotypically MIchigan gme
<drfsupercenter> 03*game
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't even know that
<drfsupercenter> 03I Just learned how to play it at a camp
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I was like "What? Only people in Michigan play euchre? LOL"
<Glacymr> 12it's the first time i heard of it
<Glacymr> !define euchre
<[TST]Bot> -!- a card game similar to ecarte; each player is dealt 5 cards and the player making trump must take 3 tricks to win a hand
<Altair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcPGL-VW7w4 i lol'd
<True_ai> Video Title: kerligirl13_s webcam video July 15, 2010, 02-52 PM [www.keepvid.com].mp4
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Quanyails> !define ecarte
<[TST]Bot> -!- a card game for 2 players; played with 32 cards and king high
<Altair> also warning slew of bad words, if it offends
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12so
<Glacymr> 12i just got to do 3 card tricks to win? :D
<Glacymr> 12pick a card pick a card
<Glacymr> 12is this your card?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03euchre is like
<drfsupercenter> 03you only play with 9, 10, and J/Q/K
<drfsupercenter> 03and ace
<Glacymr> 12whats a trick?
<drfsupercenter> 03then you pick a suit to be trump
<drfsupercenter> 03the jack of tha tsuit is the most powerful card
<Aeroslash> XD reminds me of a funny part on Loonet Tunes back in action "is this your card?" Bugs askes Elmer Fudd and licks it and puts it on Elmer's forehead
<Aeroslash> *looney
<drfsupercenter> 03then the jack of the other suit of the same color is the second most powerful
<drfsupercenter> 03then it goes Ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9
<drfsupercenter> 03and then someone plays a card
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to follow suit
<drfsupercenter> 03like if they play a club, you have to play a club
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you don't have one
<drfsupercenter> 03if you don't, you can play trump and win
<Glacymr> 12i remember this magic trick the magician that came to our school did
<Quanyails> 7Late about Excel: http://epicwinftw.com/2010/07/13/awesome-photos-oh-excel-is-good-for-something/
<drfsupercenter> 03the trick is the 4 cards that are played by the 4 people
<drfsupercenter> 03I saw that Quanyails
<Quanyails> 7I'm guessing you saw, DRF?
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03yes

<Soyuz> Mannimarco Ressurected
<Soyuz> *revisited
<Soyuz> Mannimarco Resurected; Light and Dark
<Soyuz> Daedric War
<Soyuz> Elder Council
<Soyuz> Deadly Reflexes <3
<Soyuz> and such
<Soyuz> Drake; I have GOTY for Oblivion too :P
<Drake> 04...
<Soyuz> So then I'll be able to mod both games
<Drake> 04I hate you
<Soyuz> :D
<Soyuz> I shall be sheogorath while you...
<Soyuz> be nothing
<Soyuz> I have GOTY for PS3 and PC X3
<Soyuz> and played the entire thing without mods on PC
<Soyuz> and before you ask yes
<Soyuz> I hate the Knights of the Nine
<Soyuz> and hate that little bug for vamprism
<Drake> 04that's why you abuse the Soultrap glitch
<Drake> 044000+ on strength
<Soyuz> (meaning you can never become a normal person again)
<Soyuz> and since I killed Ranimus Polis...opps
<Soyuz> :P
<Soyuz> and Midas Magic
<Soyuz> I
<Soyuz> love
<Soyuz> that mod
<Soyuz> trying to activiate( or at least continue) with another mod
<Soyuz> City of the dead
<Drake> 04you know what's really fun?
*Curly gnaws on Stryker
<Soyuz> watching cartoons? o3o
<Drake> 04soultrap glitch on your speed (3000+) use levitate 1sec, Soultrap 1 sec on target, then fly out as far as you can into the ocean
<Soyuz> I've never tried that XD
<Drake> 04it
<Drake> 04is

<Soyuz> *elswere
<Drake> 04I wanna fight Mehrunes Dagon
<Soyuz> well let me make you so very sad and very pitiful
<Drake> 04because the Oblivion storyline looks really fun
<Soyuz> you dont fight him o3o
<Drake> 04yeah you do
<Drake> 04he's just invincible
<Soyuz> and can crush you
<Drake> 04yes
<Drake> 04soultrap glitch solves all your problems
<Soyuz> but I know a mod to which you can actually become High counciler of the Elder Council and rule the mythic dawn O:
<Drake> 04mythic dawn wat-
<Soyuz> I think its called Servant of the Dawn
<Soyuz> after main quest you can chose to become apart of the New Dawn
<Soyuz> or just refuse
<Soyuz> since in the oblivion story line you have to be good
<Drake> 04...whatever that is
<Soyuz> erm..
<Soyuz> Mythic Dawn=cult
<Drake> 04oh
<Soyuz> cult=daedra worshipers
<Drake> 04I was hoping it was a ship or something
<Drake> 04anyway

<Soyuz> BAD for it takes away what morrowind offered
<Soyuz> you tranining yourself
<Tinatas> Exactly!
<Soyuz> but now? you are the son of god
<Soyuz> you're like the jesus of the world XD
<Tinatas> True.
<Soyuz> "thus saith the lord OR DIE"
<Soyuz> but I like how they made some factions enterable
<Soyuz> like Dark Brotherhood
<Soyuz> but what I extremely hate
<Soyuz> is what they did to Mannimarco ;.;
<Tinatas> BUT I WAS THE NEREVARINEEE
<Soyuz> now people just say
<Tinatas> and omg
<Tinatas> yes
<Soyuz> "oh that was his mortal form"

<Glacymr> 12i've tried interaction a lot

<Sparky> 2like right now where one of my characters is stuck in a warehouse quite a ways away

<Armageddon> w00t
<sally> curly
<sally> hi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Arti: I might have to go to the hospital soon :<
<Curly> hi sally ^^
<Articuno> 12Why???
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I might have possibly torn a muscle in my right shoulder .-.
<sally> :]
<Articuno> 12How the hell dyou do that?
<sally> hola stitch
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You have a muscle
<mibbit_ribbit> Hi Stitch
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02and you tear it
*Stitch waves.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14tried stopping myself from falling down a rather steep hill :\
*mibbit_ribbit oscillates
<PTS> !pokemon
<Nightshadow|VNC> PTS, you are a 6Oddish.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So...you tried hanging on to something?
<PTS> t_t
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Yeh
<Sneas> 03is Chevron Amethyst the same as Amethyst?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I'm guessing the jerk is what did it then?
<Articuno> 12How dyou fall down a steep hill?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14No nothing like that, I misplaced my footing
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Was climbing and stuff ._.
<sally> who was talking about mel gibbie yesterday?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02They might just be sore from that then
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Put heat on it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Well the main fact that it stupidly hurts when I move my shoulder
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Even if it isn't a torn muscle, the chances of it being dislocated are high :<
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well, I'm gonna say that they're just sore from the climb, unless you grabbed onto something while falling and gravity was still pulling you to cause a "jerk"
<Theguesst> Sounds like an injury to a limb.
<Theguesst> What happened.
<Armageddon> o_O
<Armageddon> dunno
<PTS> !fapget
<PTS> =(
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Shiny-Growlithe: I did fall quite some distance before I stopped myself
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14If I fell properly I would've broken my ankle or worse
<sally> hi stitch
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Then you most likely did tear your muscle
<Armageddon> in #4chan
<Armageddon> lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02But I still think heat will help relieve the pain
<Theguesst> So you tore a muscle near your ankle climbing, I'm guessing.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Arm, not ankle
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I believe .-.
<Theguesst> Oh
<Theguesst> LugiaLordOfTheSeas: If I fell properly I would've broken my ankle or worse <- this is why I thought ankle.
<Stitch> hi sally
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14and don't use those scripts in this chan :P
<Theguesst> So yeah, go see a chiropractor if you really think you're injured there. He can confirm if you dislocated your arm or not.
<Armageddon> not like they work
<Theguesst> That is, if the injury is really as bad as you think it is.
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst we need to mess around on redshark sometime :/
<Glacymr> 12this season i want to actually do better in tournaments, so i need to practice
<Theguesst> Redshark?
<Theguesst> Oh, a cardgame simulator
<Glacymr> 12pokebeach's little program
<Glacymr> 12granted
<Theguesst> Like the tcg version of smogon
<Glacymr> 12i don't know if the deck i'm testing
<Glacymr> 12can do anything against your little feraligatr blastoise contraption
<Glacymr> 12i can outspeed it no doubt but still
<Theguesst> Well maybe we might be able to battle in the morning if you remind me.
<Theguesst> !lag
<Glacymr> 12or if i'm awake
<Theguesst> Or that
<Glacymr> 12i usually won't get out of bed until about 1:30PM your time XD
<Zappy> 07Had to re-instal java D:
<Glacymr> 12i guess if i play the manectric version
<Glacymr> 12i would REALLY irritate your feraligatr blastoise deck XD
<Glacymr> 121 electric, 30 to everyone with a power
<Theguesst> Grass weakness :/
*Quilava squeaks
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Theguesst> And yeah
<Glacymr> 12manectric still does 30 though
<Glacymr> 12grass weakness
<Glacymr> 12might actually make things more interesting XD
<Glacymr> 12since i play masquarine
<Theguesst> Ha ha ha
<Glacymr> 121 energy pretty much says "i do 100 to feraligar and i get to draw 2 cards"
<Glacymr> 12then you do 20 less to me
<Theguesst> Maybe I could make a second deck there for my speedrill strategy.
<Glacymr> 12i dunno
<Glacymr> 12beedrill is dead
<Glacymr> 12literally
<Theguesst> I know
<Glacymr> 12btw
<Theguesst> It has a month to live
<Glacymr> 12i almost beat a beedrill deck at a tournament with giratina once XD
<Theguesst> After that, my deck is scrap
<Glacymr> 12martini, i loved that deck
<Theguesst> I wonder what I should make out of that deck
<Glacymr> 12Theguesst
<Glacymr> 12i had 3 of his beedrill in the lost card zone
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12he beat me on time
<Theguesst> 0_0 well good for him
<Glacymr> 12i know i hate that when that happens >_>
<Theguesst> I run mine with shaymin, though
<Glacymr> 12we even played the game on
<Glacymr> 12till someone won the way it's supposed to work
<Glacymr> 12and i won pretty much
<Theguesst> Preferably, you
<Theguesst> Yep
<Theguesst> Ninja'd me to it
<Glacymr> 12i wanted to put the 4th beedrill into the lost card zone
<Glacymr> 12just for laughs but i ran out of poketurns for luxray
<Arcanine> 04eep
<Glacymr> 12martini was so fun
<Glacymr> 12basically get a giratina lv. x powered up
<Glacymr> 12use luxray or pokemon reversal to bring up their claydol
<Glacymr> 12then spread around claydol
<Glacymr> 12the idea was tested and was effective, i destroyed so many decks doing that, probably the most devastating was when my opponent had 3 feraligatr prime in his lost card zone
<Glacymr> 12along with both his claydols and 13 energy
<Soyuz> mep

<zu-zulovestimeshift> 0.0
*Nick pokes you to get TF: WFC

<Nick> srsly LLOTS?
<Nick> you're the first person in my LIFE to say they dont like transformers!
*Nick cries
<LLOTS|DeadSpace> I didn't say I didn't like them
<LLOTS|DeadSpace> I'm just not a bigfan tis all
<Nick> well you liked gears of war dont you?
<LLOTS|DeadSpace> Yep
<Nick> cos WFC is similar and with full campaign co op
<Nick> but dude its better to just lurch forward in vehicle mode, transform and slice a decepticon with a big mofoing axe than it is to just duck and cover all the time
<LLOTS|DeadSpace> XD
<LLOTS|DeadSpace> I also got NFS Carbon, SEGA MegaDrive Collection and Devil May Cry 4 today XD
<Nick> also its like halo, where you can rip a gun from a turret and walk around with a BFG and waltz around like the juggernaut beeotch!

<LLOTS|DeadSpace> I prefer Ninja Gaiden 2 for boss battles :P

<name> yeah

<Roleplay4life> 5@Aurora :: The owner of the page is a gunman. And I guess a lot of the comments are praise.

<Nick> not sure if you heard about him but he went on a shooting spree near where I live right after the cumbrian shootings
<Aurora> 6o-o
<Nick> so yeah 30,000 people giving greivances to a killer instead of the victims is morally wrong
<drf|work> it's Facebook.

<Glacymr> 12Aurora, do you still have redshark? XD
<Brother> yellow and two red lines on top and on bottom
<Aurora> 6one is california, one is america, one is mexico, and I guess the other is spain
<Brother> then that damned egale..
<Aurora> 6in the middle is an eagle
<Aurora> 6...

<Brother> *Tribunal
<Andres> From Dusk Til Dawn 2 has been silly thus far D: A large amount of the cast is just watching porn.
<sally> x) lol andres
<Quanyails> 7:|
<Lyon> 04hai Quan
<Quanyails> 7Arti owes me three-and-one-half things. O_o
<Lyon> 04why?
<Lyon> 04and what 'things'?
<Quanyails> 7Sprite contest, art request, Giratina figurine, and the pseudo-hiatused egg adoptables.
<Lyon> 04ah
<Runix> i wish i knew how to make sprites
<Runix> xD
<Lyon> 04go learn
<Lyon> 04it isn't too hard to get started
<Runix> lol
<Lyon> 04start with recolours, move onto splices (combinations of two sprites) then when you think you're ready, try scratch-spriting
<Runix> i just work on Logo's, websites and whatnot
<Quanyails> 7You weren't insta-good at those, were you?
<Runix> no, i went to college
<Runix> that cost me aound 20k

*Curly sneaks back in

<Curly> :O
*Andres just finished watching a movie D:
*Curly fallhuggles Andres
<Curly> what movie?
<Andres> From Dusk Till Dawn 2 :o
<Curly> oh *just read that when she glanced up*
<Curly> was it any good?
<Andres> Okayish :o
<Andres> I liked the first one better, because Clooney had awesome tattoos!
<Curly> what's it about?
<Andres> Vampires :o
<Curly> I see :O
*Curly looks it up
<Curly> hm...
*Curly just finished reading the plot for Dusk till Dawn
<Curly> I think I'll pass
<Andres> Okay :3
<Andres> I think the major reason for the Andres to like it is because of some silly details and the fact that he first saw it as a youngerling :o
<Curly> lots of strippers and violence? :p
<Andres> I didn't even notice the nudity when I last saw it before Wednesday :x
<Curly> reminds me of Bram Stoker's Dracula
<Andres> But I liked the crotchgun, the shotgun cross and other details like that. :o
<Curly> I saw it when I was like 8 and never really noticed all the sexual things until I watched it again when I was 15 >.>
<Proto> Curly, yeah, that book is lweird
<Proto> oh the movie
<Proto> >.>
<Curly> yes :p
<Proto> wb sally

<Quanyails> !define frumious
<[TST]Bot> -!- is a combination of "fuming and furious"
<Urere> 4i wonder if it has something to do with the n64 emu
<Quanyails> 7Oh yeah, from Jabberwocky. O_o
<Espeon> Quanyails: Derp is fun I guess
<Urere> 4well
<Urere> 4i'm leaving
<Urere> 4it was nice chatting with you guys
<Espeon> Ah okay
<Espeon> cya then o3o
<Creideiki> G'evening peoples.
<Quanyails> 7Hai.
<Quanyails> 7Creideiki, y'know the program Finale?
<Creideiki> Yes, I do know of it. I use it frequently.
<Quanyails> 7:D
<drfsupercenter> 03I use that too
<drfsupercenter> 03Finale Notepad 2003a
<drfsupercenter> 03back when it was legitimately free
<Creideiki> I have the full version of Finale 2007c.
<Quanyails> 7Can you fiddle around and fix a piano arrangement, please? o.o
<Creideiki> Because of Finale's /wonderful/ track record of forward compatibility (not), which version do you use Quanyails?
<Quanyails> 7Printmusic 2010. ._.
<Brother> Creideiki: lol seems the orthodox to the east really like their czars :p
<Quanyails> 7I have an older version of Finale Notepad somewhere...
<Quanyails> 7But I think that one's 2008. :/
<Creideiki> Ah. Yeah, I'm currently stuck with anything up to and including version 2007c. Past that, the only way possible is via MusicXML
<drfsupercenter> 03http://drfsupercenter.ath.cx/Program%20Installers%20&%20Accessories/Finale%20NotePad%202003%20Installer.exe
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the best one :P
<drfsupercenter> 03http://drfsupercenter.ath.cx/Program%20Installers%20&%20Accessories/Finale%20Notepad%202005%20Installer.exe <-- not sure if that's legit free
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a 2004 "demo"
<Quanyails> 7I've never tried MusicXML, but might as well now.
<Creideiki> I have the full version of 2K3 and 2K4 though the reason I have those I would care not to explain; 2007c is because I pirated 2007... and then patched it. :P
<Quanyails> 7Okay, exported;
<Quanyails> 7Will upload.
<Creideiki> Which upload service you use?
<Quanyails> 7Imagehost.
<Creideiki> Ah
<Quanyails> 7http://h.imagehost.org/download/0195/VVVVVV_Positive_Force_Single_Piano
<Quanyails> 7I'd like your music expertise for polishing this. o3o
<Creideiki> So what do ya need? (Also, because of Finale's growth apparently there were XML errors, which Finale ignored, and it's open. Did you use any accidental or slurs, or multiple "tracking" in the pice at all? 'Cause if you did, it kind of... went away.)
<Quanyails> 7One piano, treble and bass tracks. There should be a key change in-between.
*Stitch falls out of the internet.
<Quanyails> 7Dynamics is what I'm looking for the most.
*sally catches stitch
*Proto patches the hole
*Stitch curls into a ball and sleeps.
<Creideiki> Alrighty, so it has everything so far. That is good which is nice for a change.
*sally puts stitch on a pillow and walks away
*mibbit_ribbit waves at sally
*sally waves
<Quanyails> 7Good. :)
*Stitch zzz
<Creideiki> Though, you know you can get a bit more texture out of parts if you use a secondary track/layer for some of the notes (less in measure ties.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm. Well, this is a piano arrangement. o.o
<Quanyails> 7I could give you the two-piano version...
<Stormy> I'm gone for the weekend
<Stormy> Bye everyone
<Proto> Bye Stormy :O
<Glacymr> 12wild eXAKR is happy
<sally> :O
*sally didnt get to say bye to stormy
<Proto> :<
<sally> :c
<Glacymr> 12LOL Kyu
<Glacymr> 12Smogon voted to make Salamence an uber
<Glacymr> 12i see they put back latias as well
<Creideiki> Quanyails: What I mean by multiple textures is check out this file http://mfi.re/?g67uiaop8ub1qab
<Creideiki> It's an arrangement of a Buxtehude piece.
<Quanyails> 7Sorry, we can't find "www.mfi.re". We suggest that you check the spelling of the web address or search above.
<Creideiki> MediaFire fails... http://www.mediafire.com/?g67uiaop8ub1qab
<Quanyails> 7Ah, those layers?
<Creideiki> Yes.
<Quanyails> 7Problem is if you have, let's say, a quarter-rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, and a quarter note. On another layer, you have quarter rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, eighth rest, and eighth note.
<Quanyails> 7Or if you want, fill in one set of quarter rests with notes.
<Creideiki> Well... there is a nice way of getting around the problem... for a print out.
<Creideiki> One simple hides one set of rests and then just moves the other rests downward/upward to fill the blanks.
<Quanyails> 7Hides, eh?
<Creideiki> Yep.
<Quanyails> 7How? o.o
<Creideiki> In a different piece I've arranged (W. Byrd's "The Bells [Of Osney]" there are measures that call for a third layer... for a single note... so yay H key. :P )
<Quanyails> 7o.o
<Creideiki> In F2007 all you need to do to hide a note/rest is have it selected is just hit the 'H' key.
<Quanyails> 7That's not working on PrintMusic. O_o
<Creideiki> Hmm... time for the manual?
<Quanyails> 7http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/PrintMusic2010Win/PrintMusic_Left.htm#CSHID=9501|SkinName=NewWindow <-- dah?
<Creideiki> (I don't know diddly about the new Finale versions.)
<Quanyails> 7Huh, that's strange:
<Quanyails> 7It says to press H or O.
<Quanyails> 7Ah, I have to Ctrl-click.
<Creideiki> So you use Speedy Entry?
<Quanyails> 7Nope. o.o
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Creideiki> Simple entry is the same basically... Ctrl click and then H.
<Quanyails> 7But, oy, reformatting the music. D:
<Quanyails> 7Well, thanks for the tip, anyway.
<Quanyails> 7I'll get to it tomorrow.
<Creideiki> Your quite welcome.
<Creideiki> Oh, has the newer version of Finale given you more layers?
<Quanyails> 7Four. o.o
<Creideiki> (F2007 is still on four layers, though I do believe there are 8, I don't have easy access to the remainder.)
<Creideiki> Also, in terms of dynamics for your piece... I would think that a good dynamic method would be to keep all first statements of a melodic fragment in a louder volume with the restatements in a quieter tone; also, a hint for a sudden increase in the volume of a note use that accidental that looks like a Greek capital lambda.
*Quanyails 7jots that down
<Quanyails> 7You don't mean the ^, do you?
<Creideiki> Yes that one.
<Creideiki> Also the ">" articulation also adds a tiny bit of volume.
<Creideiki> An example of those accidentals can be found in my arrangment of Sousa's "The Stars and Stripes Forever" (for six-hand piano): http://mfi.re/?28us7stullietlk
<Creideiki> (No... bad media fire... don't give me a junk link... http://www.mediafire.com/?28us7stullietlk )

<Theguesst> You don't know "over 9000"?
<drf|laptop> 03no I do
<Theguesst> So I took that and butchered it
<drf|laptop> 03I know
<drf|laptop> 03I still say "LOL wut'
<Theguesst> You sir, have no good sense of sense. Good day.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL

<sally> xD
<mibbit_ribbit> hi
<Curly> heeey Ariiii~
<Theguesst> Can't sleep right now.
*Glacymr reads Theguesst a story
<Theguesst> Actually, I just finished FMA volume 6 15 minutes ago.
<Theguesst> I've run out of manga to read ;_;
<Glacymr> 12D:
<Glacymr> 12think of a deck idea
<Theguesst> One that's not going to cost me a few limbs to get, preferably.
<Glacymr> 12budget decks
<Glacymr> 12are amazingly easy to make
<Theguesst> I'll sell my kingdra for it if I have to
<Glacymr> 12which kind of kingdra?
<Theguesst> Prime
<Glacymr> 12oh
<Glacymr> 12i've been looking for dragon pump lol
<Theguesst> And normal, actually
<Theguesst> Not selling that one since I don't think it would sell for much
<Theguesst> Compared to prime, of course.
<Glacymr> 12i think a good kingdra deck
<Glacymr> 12plays 3 prime and 1 normal
<Glacymr> 12otherwords kingdra loses to fire types
<Theguesst> I've got 1 prime and 1 normal. Go figure that the deck I have the most materials for is the most expensive deck to get.
<Glacymr> 12what would that be?
<Theguesst> See above
<Theguesst> I don't even have fifty dollars to spend
<Theguesst> On decks, that is
<Glacymr> 12i don't see it
<Theguesst> That's for an upcoming game
<Theguesst> Kingdra
<Theguesst> Deep
<Theguesst> Derp*
<Glacymr> 12kingdra isn't that expensive
<Glacymr> 12primes cost like nothing XD
<Glacymr> 12i think luxchomp depending on the build can easily be the most expensive deck
<Glacymr> 12considering some people play 2-2 Luxray
*Stitch falls out of a quit message.
<Theguesst> I blame deathgrip for that d/c.
*mibbit_ribbit catches Stitch in a net
*sally catches stitch
<sally> :OOOO
<Theguesst> Hmm... That would make a kick a screenname
<sally> HEY
<mibbit_ribbit> :3
<sally> :o
*Stitch curls into a ball.
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Theguesst> Or a 1hko move in gen 5
*mibbit_ribbit bowls a strike with Stitch
<Theguesst> :p
<Theguesst> Spoiler: zangoose's evolution learns it at level 57
<Glacymr> 12kingdra is certainly going to bea deck to fear
<Glacymr> 12i am positive i can beat it with obama though
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Theguesst> But that would be the second water deck I make
<Theguesst> Ah well
<Glacymr> 12hmm maybe i should make feraligatr abomasnow XD
<Theguesst> 0_0
<Glacymr> 12evolve snover into abomasnow
<Glacymr> 12below zero 60 paralyzed
<Glacymr> 12next turn super scoop up, pick up abomasnow, bring up another snover, rain dance 3 water to snover, then evolve into abomasnow, 60 paralyzed
*Theguesst runs like he'll
<Glacymr> 12keep repeating that process for as long as you can XD
<Theguesst> but the use ends there.
<Theguesst> Not a good pokemon to keep lying around.
<Glacymr> 12after that you jut snow play until you lose a couple abomasnow then bring up feraligatr prime
<Glacymr> 12everone has like 60-80 damage on them
<Glacymr> 12making feraligatr prime's attack quite a serious threat
<Stitch> X
<Theguesst> It has a high retreat, high movecost, and you'll run out of energies once you use them up on your other pokemon
<Theguesst> The third more so than the rest
<Theguesst> So run fisherman or something to get the energies back
<Theguesst> Oh sh
<Theguesst> I forgot to order some pokemon communications a week ago
<Theguesst> O.O"
<Glacymr> 12i have a guy who sells cards in my area
<Glacymr> 12he overprices a lot of things but a lot of things i can get him on
<Stitch> where, wanna be a target for my quickscope practicing? c:
<Glacymr> 12for example he sold me 15 pokemon collector for 5 dollars
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Theguesst> I hate you again
<Theguesst> :/
<Theguesst> Anyways, I have a cardstore that could sell me this stuff.
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Theguesst> And I could sell a few of my cards through them as well
<Glacymr> 12i'm going to go to that guy next week
<Theguesst> Get rid of this lanturn
<Glacymr> 12to see if he'll buy any of my old cards
<Theguesst> I just give away all my old cards to younger league members because I'm generous lime that
<Theguesst> Like*
<Theguesst> I wish I could sleep.
<Glacymr> 12i dunno sometimes i think it will confuse them more than anything
<Glacymr> 12giving them a bunch of old cards that they won't be able to play later
<Theguesst> Well the professor did that, too.
<Theguesst> :p
<Glacymr> 12i can't wait to rebuild flariados Theguesst
<Glacymr> 12basically the SV Magmortar has that power
<Theguesst> I'm going to try to get some sleep again
*Curly goes to bed

*Curly is scared to death of that thing
<Tuffy> 04=3
<Spyrorocks> we confinscated it, and he didn't even take off, he stayed inside the park while we called the cops.

<Spyrorocks> I actually dont like waterslides.
<Glacymr> 12hi Articuno

<Tuffy> 04Im playing on my English SS
<Stitch> Hell of a job for you, then.
<Curly> well I've gone down every other slide except that one >.>
<Glacymr> 12i was messing with pokebeach chat members XD

<Spyrorocks> Proto, he yelled some more and we had to kick him out.
<Proto> Was it an iPhone4?
<Stitch> XD
<Curly> how long have you worked there Spyro?
<Articuno> 12Hey Glac ^^

<Proto> Spyrorocks, shoulda called china and left it on the call for a few hours
<Proto> woulda been funnier
<Spyrorocks> even if he does, he agreed to the park policy when he entered that holds us unliable if something gets ruined
<Articuno> 12Hey they had a Leeds Shaymin event once and I happened to be on holiday that day down South :/
<Tuffy> 04eep
<Glacymr> 12i had one of them playing the "guess who" game because one of them knew i was logged on their forums so he kept asking me questions like "does your name start with a capital letter?"
<Tuffy> 04Thats a distance from me
<Spyrorocks> We didnt ruin it on purpose
<Stitch> Ooh.
<Stitch> Well that works out.
<Stitch> Andres, time left?
<Proto> reminds me of xkcs
<Proto> xkcd*
<Articuno> 12Newcastle's a distance from me XD but at least we have the car and to be honest.. we can get the train free as well cos Xai's a train driver XD
<Spyrorocks> if he wants to be a jackass, thats fine, but if he crosses the line between being a jackass and pissing us off, then thats when he gets kicked out.
<Tuffy> 04I dont ._.
<Proto> the one where the devil walks into the room with the sign that says "by entering this room you forfeit your soul to the owner"
<Glacymr> 12hmm

<Tuffy> 04Im in a cottage for a week
<Spyrorocks> apple did say that
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, I can do that.
<Spyrorocks> they said that again at their press conference
<Spyrorocks> like yesterday
<Tuffy> 04I'ss lovely
<Articuno> 12Where ? ^^
<Tuffy> 04Lake District
<Articuno> 12Hi TimeShift ^
*Proto smashes an iPad over steve job's head
<Articuno> 12*^^
*where wants a ut D:
<Spyrorocks> I tried to get my nexus to drop bars but it wouldn;t.
<Articuno> 12Oh nice XD we were gonna go there this weekend.. what part?
<Proto> lol
<Tuffy> 04Uhh...I keep forgetting >.<
<Spyrorocks> ut?
<Articuno> 12Gah XD
<Stitch> where, we're about to start, just waiting for Andres.
<Stitch> Andres Andres Andres.
<Tuffy> 04Somewhere around Hawkshead
<Curly> apple said what?
<Spyrorocks> Stitch, how much do you need for your server
<Proto> That all phones drop signals when held wrong
<TimeShift> you know what I love about a german breakfast? The wonderful-delicious bread :)
<Articuno> 12Well I'll show you on Google maps where we usually go, family member has a caravan
<Curly> ...
<Spyrorocks> apple said that anyone who buys their products are idiots.
<Curly> what the hell >_>
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, like, $150.
<Tuffy> 04It's raining.
<Proto> my sentiments exactly, Curly
<LaptopAristeo> :3
<Stitch> Not to keep it going.
<Spyrorocks> wtf Stitch is that per month?
<Stitch> But to make it better.
<Stitch> No.
<Spyrorocks> tell me WHAT you need $150 for.
<Spyrorocks> I know for sure you wontpay that per month
<Stitch> Actually..Only $75.
<TimeShift> ah, one thing Arti: Do you have any idea if wild camping is allowed in england/near you?
<Stitch> For a one-time installment of 1GB RAM.
*Stitch only has 256MB right now.
<Stitch> Almost maxed it out with shaymin irc, apache, and 3 UrT servers.
<Stitch> I was like 5MB from maxing it.
<where> Cut out one of the ut servers?
<Stitch> Even with 1 UrT server it's at 128.
<Spyrorocks> how much are you paying a month?
<Stitch> $20.
<Articuno> 12Yes in certain places, more so in Scotland as there's endless land there but you're more at risk of being shot by hunters XD
<Spyrorocks> Stitch, why dont you just run it on dragonite?
<Articuno> 12Tuffy, Pooley Bridge near Ullswater
<Spyrorocks> for $50/month you can colo a server at volumedrive
*Stitch shrugs.
<Stitch> I thought shaymin would be easier.
<Spyrorocks> I might colo some time.
<TimeShift> I doubt I'll be shot whilst sleeping in a campervan :)
*Stitch doesn't have that kind of budget. XD
<Spyrorocks> but id stick the server in vancouver so I could physically go to it.
<Articuno> 12Thats NOT camping ¬¬
<Spyrorocks> and id set up VPSs on it for things.
<TimeShift> it is - but still a bit different
*Stitch isn't completely sure where his server is.
<Stitch> I know it's Seattle.
<Tuffy> 04We're gonna take a look at the shops today, apparently there's a wide range of stuff.
<Articuno> 12Try some camping in a tent in wild Scotland, so much fun <3
<Articuno> 12Find out where you are Tuffy XD
<Articuno> 12I'm curious ^^
<Tuffy> 04Ok lol.
<Spyrorocks> if I could id get Shaw's 100mbps at my uncle's office
<Tuffy> 04I'll ask Mum once she wakes up.
<Spyrorocks> but it costs big bucks..
<Spyrorocks> shaw is a scam anyways
<TimeShift> maybe I'm just a bit too lazy, but I prefer a real bed over pure soil :P
<Tuffy> 04Im making my way to the League on SS
<Curly> I like shaw. for my home net anyway
<Stitch> But anyway, if I am moving UrT to dragonite, it won't be tonight because it takes time and we all want to play.
<Articuno> 12I lost my DS :/
<Tuffy> 04Oof!
<TimeShift> oO
<Articuno> 12It's in my house somwewhere.. I hope
<Tuffy> 04My team so far;
<Articuno> 12Because last time I had it was in this room.. then poof
*Stitch really only got Shaymin to practice owning a server.
<where> Can we play now pleeease? :D
<Tuffy> 04BIRDY the Pidgeot lv 37, Wibble the Poliwrath lv 37, Torment the Misdreavus 38, SickEmMOAR the Sudowoodo 36, Parsley the Meganium 38
<Stitch> With 10GB HDD and 256MB RAM, this really isn't a real server. XD
<Stitch> where, as soon as you find Andres.
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Proto> ANDRES!
<Tuffy> 04Which ones your favourite? =p
<Articuno> 12I like the name Parseley
*Stitch just noticed LaptopAristeo.
<Articuno> 12and SickEmMOAR LOLZ
<Tuffy> 04I got it from a kids show, the Herbs, Parsley the Lion
<Articuno> 12that's genius XD
<Articuno> 12I remember that :3
<Tuffy> 04Yeah, see whut I did thar?
<Proto> lol
<Articuno> 12Yes XD I love it
<Articuno> 12It actually took me a few seconds to get it
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, Curly, you guys ready?
*where is ready o>
<Curly> I don't think I'm going to play considering what my computer did >.>
<Stitch> D:
*Curly will try later
<where> Nooooooo
<Proto> I could play if I could stand in one place and snipe >.>
<Spyrorocks> come on...
<Stitch> We need at least 4. D:
<Spyrorocks> Proto, sure.
<Stitch> XD
<Stitch> Proto, I've got just the map.
*Proto looks up for the link
<Stitch> http://urbanterror.info Proto
<Proto> Gracias, senor
<Proto> What am I looking for now
<Proto> found it
<Curly> I could never really figure out where to put my programs on linux' file system >_>
<Curly> I wish there was a 'program files' folder :I
<Stitch> http://www.urbanterror.info/docs/texts/110/
<Stitch> Curly, my UrT is on my desktop.
<Curly> I don't like using my desktop :<
<Proto> Does it matter if I download voxel or quake unity?
*Proto pokes Stitch
<Stitch> I suggest Quake Unity if you live NW USA.
<Proto> I live in florida
<Stitch> But they're the same files.
<TimeShift> I found another tracer of your most famous (and hated by you) Lugia pic^^
<where> What's that map that I think is one of the default ones for ut, it's like an arabic merchant quarter place
<where> |
<Stitch> Algiers?
<where> i don't knwo how else to describe it
<where> Yeah i think that;s it
<TimeShift> funny how people always insist they didn't trace it, but if you take the picture and overlay it on the original, almost every single line fits^^
<Articuno> 12THe one of Lugia under the sea with all the anatomical errors?
<where> Yeah
<where> That's the one
<where> ,3 it
<Stitch> where, Spyrorocks, shall we practice while Proto downloads and Andres does who knows what?
<where> <3
<where> Sure
<TimeShift> correct
<Stitch> Spyrorocks?
*Proto watches his download speed climb
<Articuno> 12Lol XD
<Articuno> 12Link?
<Proto> wow this sucks
<Spyrorocks> yes?
<Proto> 110kb/s
<TimeShift> 1sec
<Proto> -_-
<Stitch> D:
<where> D:
<Spyrorocks> use a download manager pto
<Spyrorocks> proto
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Stitch> Spyrorocks, I asked if you want to practice while he's downloading.
<Spyrorocks> sure
<Proto> What's a good download manager for chrome
<Stitch> /connect stitch.epic-chat.net
<Stitch> Let's go.
<where> Coming!
<TimeShift> http://jacob70420.deviantart.com/#/d2u2vo0
<TimeShift> and it's funny how people instantly start insulting as soon as you've lifted the curtain around their fraud
<Articuno> 12That isn't traced though
<Articuno> 12I think I know my own art enough
<Articuno> 12He's made it even more anatomically incorrect
<Lyon> 04lol
<TimeShift> so failing in copying a fail? xD
<Tuffy> 04lololol
<Articuno> 12LOOL
<Articuno> 12Well yes I guess
<TimeShift> reminds me in the song of Meowth during Pokemon Live! :)
<TimeShift> "We're the best in being the worst!"
<Articuno> 12XD
<Tuffy> 04lol
<Lyon> 04oxymoron's FTW
<Andres> No plays for me :o
<Proto> :o
<Andres> Another corruptness :o
<Articuno> 12brb
<Proto> :<
<TimeShift> the lyrics - just sweet^^
<TimeShift> (MEOWTH SOLO)
<TimeShift> WE'RE THE BEST AT BEING THE WORST
<TimeShift> WE'RE STATISTICALLY NUMBER ONE
<TimeShift> (JAMES SOLO)
<TimeShift> YEAH, A HUNDRED PERCENT
<TimeShift> (JESSE SOLO)
<TimeShift> INCOMPETENT
<TimeShift> (MEOWTH SOLO)
<TimeShift> HEY - THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE!
<TimeShift> WE'RE VERY GOOD AT BEING VERY BAD
<TimeShift> IT'S OUR RATE OF SUCCESS
<TimeShift> THAT'S SADLY BEEN WEAK
<Andres> I'll play more Prawn To Be Wild :o

<TimeShift> Arti, you know what kind of plane the DC-3 is, right?^^
<Articuno> 12I know of it, not too much about it
<Stitch> http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/demotivational-posters-wait.jpg
<TimeShift> someone saw such a plane - the body completely clean and polished. So he asked the pilots: "Wow, what you use for polish?"
<TimeShift> answer: "Speed-only, sir!"
<Articuno> 12:>
<TimeShift> a DC-3....speed....lol^^
<Articuno> 12Is that a joke or a real quote though?
<TimeShift> a real quote in fact
<TimeShift> that's what makes it even more funny^^
<TimeShift> and know what's even more funny?
<Articuno> 12Lol what?
<TimeShift> a guy came to our airschool and complained about our planes. About the radio being so damn f***ed up because nobody could understand him
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<TimeShift> he turned around....and we almost started laughing....
<TimeShift> ...he still wore his headset...but the microphone was set on the BACK of his HEAD...
<Articuno> 12LOL!
<Articuno> 12Fail, let me tell Xai
<TimeShift> but yeah, yeah, our crappy radios....yeah^^
<Articuno> 12Doesn't sound real.. sounds like something that would happen on TV....
<TimeShift> or - two trainers touching down with a Beechcraft....without lowering the landing gear. Both forgot it...and none of them would talk to the other again
<Articuno> 12D:
<TimeShift> hey, both were very experienced trainers....but both forgot to lower the gear^^
<Articuno> 12LOL it happens
<Articuno> 12Always to the most experienced it seems :>
<TimeShift> so true
<TimeShift> yet my trainer told me about 20 to 30 people land on our runway without lowering gear. That's why I proposed to put a livestream-cam there....better than ANY comedy series^^

<Proto> Noooooooooooooooo
<eXAKR> I just crashed Opera by opening too many Know Your Meme tabs
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04>> just tried to go to a shopping centre, an out of town one - there was a constant stream of cars going in there and no where to park so I had to come back without going in.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'll try again later haha
<Articuno> 12I think Summer hols just started ¬¬
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04In some counties it's next week
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I mean, Friday of next week.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04A lot of car drivers are selfish too, I just needed one person to let me out so I could drive through and no one would xD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Oh well
*Quanyails 7continues pestering Arti. o3o

<Andres> Mrrrr!
<Proto> ANDRES
<Proto> Hi
*mibbit_ribbit waves
<Andres> Hi!
<Altair> wbs
<Messoris> tys
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Hi TimeShift
<TimeShift> hi RN
<Articuno|AFK> 12I's back!
<TimeShift> omg - call 911#
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04wb
<TimeShift> or 112 or 411 or...bleh, erm, whatever
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04999 here xD
<Articuno> 12^^
<Articuno> 12I wish I had someone to go out with right now
<Articuno> 12Its a nice evening and Im gonna be stuck here
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm bored too, I just talked to the girl in the corner shop for ages LOL
<Articuno> 12Poor girl *runs*
<Articuno> 12Just kidding
<Articuno> 12I wish it was me
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Burnett's at work til 9pm then I'll pick him up LOL and hehe she was ok I know her, we always talk.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04A lot of people in Asda are only getting 4 days off a month now >>
<Articuno> 12Thats ridiculous
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Well it's overtime but they have to take overtime to make ends meet if that makes sense?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Cos the contracts are 16 hours, then the rest is overtime if you wanna be able to go out and stuff.
<Articuno> 12Ohh I see
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Maybe they should pay their staff a bit more but they can't because then the prices would go up...LOL so people have to do overtime XD
<Articuno> 12Lmao
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04That also means they need less staff and it saves them money.
<Articuno> 12I forgot why but can't burnett get another job?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Sometimes though, Burnett has to do 3 10 hours shifts in a row.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04There isn't anything else.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm having trouble looking for stuff but I can't work in Asda because I don't like retail work. I would if I had to though. :)
<Articuno> 12He wont do office stuff will he?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04No he doesn't like it.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Plus it's very hard to find office work even for me who has 3-4 years' experience at the min.
<Articuno> 12Yeh ¬¬
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm not worried though, my mum was asking for £350 board a month plus I had to pay my bills and buy my own food, my situation is better than that even now LOL
<Articuno> 12^^

<Articuno> 12Lol read up, he's not annoying, he's entertaining
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04When people like that come in it's just so funny.
<Fail> Articuno, you're a <censored> retarded dumbass who kills over a swear word/name calling, how pathetic can you be retarded <censored>
<Articuno> 12I think the funniest part is how he (or she) sits there and takes it all
<KyroTheAssassin> so am i :P but i usually dont show it
<Skylands> 10...lol
<Brother> I find it more amsing that damn, hell and other words are accepted at this site but words that start with h and end with y :P
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04LOLOLOLOLOL look at that xD he really tried
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04omg that has to go in the peas
<Articuno> 12Hell is a swear word? XD
<Articuno> 12I heard it wasn't
<Articuno> 12When I asked a bunch of Americans here
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04It's not
<Brother> lol, what americans?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04it's the name of a place in the bible and as far as I know, the bible doesn't contain swearing.
<Brother> they might consider it...well hell but its usually a name to 'swear' at someone
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04So therefore the word 'damn' isn't swearing either. Do you think they'd allow swearing in the bible? xD
<Articuno> 12Can't remember, a load of them from chat
<Andrew> it's a cuss word in america, especially the south
<Brother> Yes
<Andrew> afaik
<Brother> they allow ALOT in the bible
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04But then they have swear words in the bible Andrew.
<Andrew> heh
<TimeShift> for some americans even motherf**** is not an insult, but a very usual term :P
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I don't think their god would be pleased with that.
<Andres> Radda?
<SheenaFox> wb LLOTS
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Not here long
<Andrew> i love how the bible contradicts itself so much
<Brother> their god doesnt care XD

*sally animorphs
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04It's expensive there and there's no smirnoff ice
<Andrew> yeah that place was really classy
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04lolololol
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04yeah I felt out of place xD
<Articuno> 12Why? I went there in a jumper and jeans once

<Articuno> 12Meh, I guess but the type of people who go don't stay there all night :23
<Articuno> 12*:3
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Yeah I suppose, but it's a bit of a waste of taxi fare XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04unless they go home and are still talking to their friends and stuff
<Andrew> a bet a lot of people go there before going to clubs
<Articuno> 12I don't think so
<Articuno> 12Just because of the price
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I didn't like the taste of the drink I got LOL
<Andrew> well you won't get the student types that go to crappy studenty clubs
<LLOTS|Away> LOOOOOL at pic RN
<Articuno> 12Anyway when I get married, I might hold my hen night there, or part of it. Iwant to have a restaurant meal

<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm not gonna have a hen night, less internet time xD

<Rocket_Ninetales> 04at this rate we'll be getting married in 2020 lol - unless we have just a 2 witness thing which we don't mind :)
<TimeShift> I wonder why people ask others what a specific filetype might be...instead of asking google
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04Burnett is very much a chavvy club type lol but some people are just like that :)
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04it's like on yahoo answers when people ask medical questions...why don't they go to a doctor?
<Andrew> haha
<TimeShift> I understand it for americans with no health insurance....but the rest?
<Andrew> well the metal club i go to is a bit of a dive
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I don't like metal clubs, too many emos
<Andrew> hmm true
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04and - too many 12 year olds pretending to like rock music
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04but I don't mind over 18 ones
<Andrew> but in this one there's an emo room where the emos stay away from the metalheads
<Articuno> 12LOL!!!!!
<Brother> Andrew; to preserve peace? :P
<KyroTheAssassin> i like rock rock
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04there's a club here where the rock fans have to walk upstairs through the chavs
<KyroTheAssassin> :D
<Andrew> Brother - indeed :P
<TimeShift> they pretend liking rock music...in fact they like hiphop and all the crap
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04yeah
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04and they like rock music for like...a month
*KyroTheAssassin listens to only Linkin Park :D
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04I'm pretty tolerant of most music
<Brother> I usually hate it when they make good songs into rock variations
<Rocket_Ninetales> 04right, going for the night now cos got to go out and then pick Burnett up from work
<Articuno> 12Ok

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> nvm later everyone
<Roara> quiet
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just reminiscing (sp) about some old games I loved
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_X8YQRIsA <-- this is like, the coolest thing ever
<Roara> insert crikets here
<drfsupercenter> 03both the game, that level, and the music
<drfsupercenter> 03er, both LOL, w/e the word is
<Roara> what game is that o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03Commander Keen
<drfsupercenter> 03that particular one is game 6
<drfsupercenter> 03they were made in 1991, same year I was born :)
<drfsupercenter> 03old computer games, whcih is why it's fricking amazing
<Roara> that music at first reminded me of goldeneye
<Roara> which is an awesome game
<drfsupercenter> 03as it could easily have been SNES, it was literally groundbreaking
<drfsupercenter> 03like for its time it was the most amazing thing ever
<drfsupercenter> 03now I'll play it and people will be like "WTF?"
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a little odd, but I love it
<drfsupercenter> 03the story is like this 10 year old kid who fights aliens with a stun gun XD
<Roara> xD
<drfsupercenter> 03and he has a "Bean and Bacon Megarocket"
<drfsupercenter> 03as in he built his spaceship out of bean and bacon cans
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Roara> that is serious win
<drfsupercenter> 03weird, yes. But loads of fun, also yes
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah I know XD
<Roara> imagine hold up that in a bank robbery
<Roara> *holding
<drfsupercenter> 03what, a stun gun?
<Roara> hands up! this is a bean and bacon megarocket!
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03XD yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I grew up with that game, before we ever had a console
<drfsupercenter> 03I first got an N64 when I was like 11 LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03before that, it was just Keen, that's all I had
<Roara> I'm trying to remember this computer game I was highly addicted to when I was 4
<drfsupercenter> 03that and like Tetris LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03for Windows
<Roara> all I remember is some guy jumping over fire
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<Roara> SUPER old
<Roara> but argh
<Roara> something about how the fire looked
<Roara> made me happy
<Roara> still does, like one of those comfort things you barely remember from diaper age
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I literally played Commander Keen from the time I was like 3 up til now
<drfsupercenter> 03i quite literally grew up with it
<Roara> I remember playing on my grandma's windows 95 LOL
<Roara> that thing was beastly
<Roara> win95 + whatever box she had with it
*LaptopAristeo wonders where sally ran off to :o
<Roara> crap
<Roara> now I really wanna remember that game
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Get this
<drfsupercenter> 03our Windows 95 computer literally cost $3500
<drfsupercenter> 03that's how much computers were back then
<Roara> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03and it was't even that great, it was just a normal Compaq desktop
<Roara> $3500 of our day or those days?
<drfsupercenter> 03those days.
<Roara> those days it would be even more today
<drfsupercenter> 03my dad found the receipt lying around LOL
<Roara> ..
<Roara> D:
<drfsupercenter> 03after all these years
<drfsupercenter> 03and I was like OMGLOL
<Roara> how did my grandma afford that LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03we bought it at Comp USA
<drfsupercenter> 03which doesn't even exist anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03and who knows XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean I'm sure they weren't ALL that much
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe like $2000 was a lower end computer
<drfsupercenter> 03but still, they were really expensive compared to now
*Soyuz is done reading BT guide
*Roara is sewing
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/ <-- if anyone is bored

<Soyuz> ah
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_X8YQRIsA <- gameplay
<drfsupercenter> 03I posted it here a little while ago
*Stitch explodes.
<Soyuz> wow that hurt my eyes
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03why, because of the quality?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, it kinda sucks
<Armageddon> 02woah
<Armageddon> 02http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,3749.msg210942#new
<drfsupercenter> 03plus the guy totally cheated and is using God mode
<Roara> it's rerally good
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why he never dies >_>
<Armageddon> 02read from the top of that page
<Roara> considering the date
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the video itself has crappy quality
<Roara> oh
<Roara> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03like it's all pixelated
<Roara> well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the game itself looks better
<drfsupercenter> 03but I can only find so much XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, it basically looks like a SNES game
<drfsupercenter> 03and I STILL like SNES graphics over 3D ones XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's more fun
<Soyuz> if there's any 90s game I really like, its the first Fallouts :P
<drfsupercenter> 03like meh, those super realistic games bug me
<drfsupercenter> 03I like the corny 2D ones XD
<drfsupercenter> 03like Sonic and SMB and whatnot
<drfsupercenter> 03those are more fun
<drfsupercenter> 03and often more hard
<drfsupercenter> 03Donkey Kong was like, the hardest game ever
<drfsupercenter> 03to beat
<Soyuz> oh god
<Soyuz> I could never beat that
<drfsupercenter> 03only 3 people beat the entire game
<drfsupercenter> 03ever
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03old games > new ones IMO
<drfsupercenter> 03The new one have better graphics but they're kinda meh otherwise
<Soyuz> I dont even REMEBER how to beat Super Mario 64
<Soyuz> Fallout 1 and 2 > Fallout 3
<Soyuz> in even graphics
<Soyuz> for, when you somehow get a critical hit
<Soyuz> its as if you really blew half of them up o3o
*Glacymr gives Soyuz some soy sauce
<Glacymr> 12drfsupercenter
<Glacymr> 12i personally like games that are easier to beat
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12but have side quests you can do that takes a lot of challenge
<Soyuz> But eh I'm a Dawn of War fan also
<Soyuz> its entire series is awsome
<LaptopAristeo> :o
*LaptopAristeo falls asleep
<Glacymr> 12i think 90% of the N64 games they made were harder than heck
<Roara> Kirby 64 <3
<Aristeo> I hope she doesn't get on like *right* after I turn off my monitor

<Roara> 6liek, omg, do I know you?
<Roara> 6</beverlyhillsstyle>

<Glacymr> 12lol Roara
<Soyuz> though it'd be more interesting if it was OMFG :P
<Roara> 6xD
<OMG> You could set OMfG
<OMG> Sadly, F is not a valid channel mode.
<Glacymr> 12i still think MGS is more epic
<Glacymr> 12would be fun
<OMG> I don't get it.
<Soyuz> that is old series
<OMG> MGS is possible to set, and so are some swear words.
<OMG> Who are the IRC operators on this network? Or is drfsupercenter the only one?
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03why?
<Glacymr> 12Metal Gear Solid
<OMG> Just curious, or do you need a better explanation than that?
<drfsupercenter> 03seems kinda stalkerish to walk in and ask who the ircops are
<OMG> Usually the nicks of a network's IRC operators are in the MOTD.
<Roara> 6...
<drfsupercenter> 03we don't even have a MOTD LOL
<Roara> 6how the heck do you know drf is an ircop?

<OMG> Over 9000.
<junh1024-XDCC> nah
<junh1024-XDCC> under 9000\
<OMG> 1600 > 9000.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14This laptop has some nasty virus that nothing I know can detect
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, the one that's called "Windows"?
*drfsupercenter hides
<BPzeBanshee> 03Not even Avira
<BPzeBanshee> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<drfsupercenter> 03and wtf Avira
<drfsupercenter> 03that program is lame
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14^
<BPzeBanshee> 06It's always done the trick for me
<drfsupercenter> 03same with me and Malwarebytes
<drfsupercenter> 03but see
<drfsupercenter> 03us real pros just don't get viruses in the first place
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Avira is dangerous to windows
<junh1024-XDCC> i use explorer.exe to detect virus
<drfsupercenter> 03I only ever use it on other people's machines LOL
<junh1024-XDCC> if it crashes, it micro$not's fault
<drfsupercenter> 03I haven't gotten a virus in years
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14drf, tell that to my mum LOOL
<Aurora> 6LLOTS, is it that bloody microsoft security center virus?
<BPzeBanshee> 06xD
<junh1024-XDCC> ./me runn
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Aurora: No
<Proto> Why
<Soyuz> LOOOL oh god that thread is hilarious
<Aurora> 6oh
<Proto> Why is there a lemon
<Proto> Why
<OMG> Windows just isn't up to Linux's standard in general.
<sally> lol
<sally> i'm stuck too
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Whatever the virus is, it's kills the WGA.exe and makes all windows programs go bawwwwwww
<drfsupercenter> 03Linux is more hardcore, but Windows can do more
<Proto> I've got 4 things missing
<OMG> Typically, XP takes about 1 minute - 1 and a half minutes to start up, while Linux takes about 10 seconds.
<junh1024-XDCC> not that 3Windows can do more but more programs are written for it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14OMG there you are stupidly wrong
<sally> me too
<OMG> Windows does do more, and it's better for every day use.
<Aurora> 6bawwwwwww lol
<drfsupercenter> 03my Windows boots up just as fast
<BPzeBanshee> 061 and a half minute to start up? TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<BPzeBanshee> 06I get less with it.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I did have a windows comp that took under 10 seconds to load
<drfsupercenter> 03as Linux
<Proto> Are they the one betweenthe book and trashcan
<drfsupercenter> 03takes like 45 seconds here probably
<BPzeBanshee> 06I get it to boot up in some 20 seconds.
<Proto> and the ones beside the paper
<BPzeBanshee> 06Maybe 30 with my legacy machine.
<Proto> and the one on the very top right?
<OMG> Most XP computers take about a minute.
<BPzeBanshee> 06Yeah, roughly.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14^wrong
<drfsupercenter> 03not the ones I run in a VM
<OMG> There's some faster ones that take less.
<drfsupercenter> 03Those take about 10 seconds
<BPzeBanshee> 06That's because they're in a VM.
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<BPzeBanshee> 06Duh.
<drfsupercenter> 03the VM is going to have *less* power than my real computer dude
<sally> did u get the stuff inside the book?
<drfsupercenter> 03if I felt like installing XP on here
<drfsupercenter> 03it would boot up instantly XD

<Proto> Aha
<Proto> found it
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows 7 is nice
<BPzeBanshee> 06I dont trust any of the new ones past XP.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's better than Vistrash
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Win7 is nice
<sally> did u get the knife?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14but annoying
<junh1024-XDCC> 6 Win7 is crappier sometimes
<sally> and the paper with the colors on it?
<BPzeBanshee> 06Hmm, I see.
<OMG> Win7 is annoying
*Stitch tries to escape Mr. Evil Scientist.
<Proto> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03just takes some getting used toi
<drfsupercenter> 03-i
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm now a pro at it
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I'll stick to XP
<OMG> I still prefer XP over the other Windows OSes, but it's not that bad.
<junh1024-XDCC> ORLY nao, drf?
<sally> i am still missing two things now
<drfsupercenter> 03yarly
<Proto> Me too
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh, stupid retainer
<OMG> I still like Linux RedHat
<drfsupercenter> 03I should prolly wear it more
<drfsupercenter> 03EW RED HAT
<drfsupercenter> 03I like Ubuntu, but eh
<Proto> Wooooooooooooooooo
<drfsupercenter> 03I still prefer Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03because I'm an A/V nerd
<sally> i cut the lemon...
<junh1024-XDCC> so tell me, how do i make my start menu show the contsnts of my music folder directly, not show me folders of options?
<drfsupercenter> 03audio/video, not antivirus
<OMG> It works nicely for me.
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you want to?
<drfsupercenter> 03I just have a shortcut to music
<Soyuz> lol wow "hired chinese"
<Soyuz> how racist can you get
<drfsupercenter> 03if it listed the contents directly it would take up about 27 screens XD
<sally> :O
<sally> did u cut the lemon?
<Proto> No :(
*sally used it on a book and numbers came up
<Proto> How do I do it :(
<junh1024-XDCC> you sidestepped the question/
<sally> click on the lemon
<OMG> Ubuntu isn't too bad, though Fedora is worse.
*Stitch is so close to looking up the answers. >>
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno how to do that
<sally> like on the side part where it turns red
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not saying I know how to do 100% of things
<sally> lol dont look it up Stitch !!
<drfsupercenter> 03but I know how to do as much stuff in 7 as I knew in XP
<drfsupercenter> 03only took mea few days
<drfsupercenter> 03+space
<Proto> okay, got the lemon up
<junh1024-XDCC> baw
<Grimm> u need the dragonball
<sally> drag the knife to it
<OMG> RedHat is a nice Linux distro, and the server is pretty good as well.
<Proto> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate Red Hat
<Proto> Is like magic
<drfsupercenter> 03the whole concept of them selling it
<sally> lol
<sally> now
<BPzeBanshee> 06:S Selling Linux?
<sally> click on the book that says the life and times of whatever
<BPzeBanshee> 06WTFBBQ
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03technically they're "selling support"< but you can't get RHEL for free
<OMG> I like the actual concept but the selling part is silly.
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to pay a ton of money
<sally> *life and opinions
<drfsupercenter> 03like, more than Windows eVEN
<drfsupercenter> 03*even
<OMG> $80 for the desktop version.
<drfsupercenter> 03for one year...
<Proto> Yeah, I got the battery :D
<sally> yeps
<OMG> RedHat as in the OS is good, but the selling idea isn't.
<drfsupercenter> 03I still prefer Ubuntu
<drfsupercenter> 03my university has Red Hat and it's kinda silly
<BPzeBanshee> 06Ewwbuntu
<BPzeBanshee> 06lol
<OMG> Fedora is the free version of RedHat, but typically it's one of the worst Linux distros.
<Proto> Stuck again
<Proto> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03there's also Centos
<BPzeBanshee> 06I'd prefer Lubuntu myself cause it runs much faster and has closed-source stuff in by default
<OMG> Ubuntu is pretty useful.
<OMG> Centos is bad. That's all.
<BPzeBanshee> 06Unfortunately the Terminal doesnt work so well
<junh1024-XDCC> i liek xubuntu
<BPzeBanshee> 06i lik 2 tlk 2 da pplz
<drfsupercenter> 03I like just regular Ubuntu, 9.04
<BPzeBanshee> 06You still have v9?
<drfsupercenter> 03the new ones suck
<drfsupercenter> 03Yes
<drfsupercenter> 0310.04 is terrible
<BPzeBanshee> 06I got 10 myself, that explains a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03Stupid Mac OSX looking GUI, makes me want to hurt somebody
<drfsupercenter> 03and from what I can see there's really nothing new
<OMG> I still have Linux RedHat 5.6, and that works pretty well.
<drfsupercenter> 03besides native iPod support and that's just plain silly
<BPzeBanshee> 06Well Mac OS X is actually built on UNIX to be fair
<drfsupercenter> 03I know but I hate the GUI
<drfsupercenter> 0310.04's default GUI looks like OSX
<drfsupercenter> 03with the buttons on the left, to close and whatnot
<drfsupercenter> 03instad of the right
<drfsupercenter> 03*instead
<BPzeBanshee> 06Yeah, it does actuallly
<drfsupercenter> 03it bugs me
<drfsupercenter> 03I like 9.04
<BPzeBanshee> 06:S
<junh1024-XDCC> i dont minde
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried 9.10 and it was stupid, so I went back to 9.04 LOL
<OMG> Win7's GUI looks like Mac OSX's.
<BPzeBanshee> 06Indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03no it doesn't
<junh1024-XDCC> ^QFT
<drfsupercenter> 03it looks nothing like it
<BPzeBanshee> 06They ripped off OSX's Dock system
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't have a launcher, for one
<drfsupercenter> 03dock, w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03and wtf?
<junh1024-XDCC> yes it does
<drfsupercenter> 03It doesn't have bouncing icons
<drfsupercenter> 03#1
<BPzeBanshee> 06Lol
<Proto> Rage
<BPzeBanshee> 06Boing boing boing
<OMG> What, with the rounded windows dialog boxes, large icons, and transparency?
<drfsupercenter> 03#2, programs are only there if they're open
<drfsupercenter> 03OSX they're *always* there
<drfsupercenter> 03OSX has no transparency
<junh1024-XDCC> windows 7 moved into a /hybrid document-app ceentric approach with their ripoff dock taskbar thingy
<BPzeBanshee> 06Transparency?
<sally> i'm stuck again
<sally> xD
<sally> lol
<sally> did u put it in the fire alarm?
<sally> :o did ya do it?
<junh1024-XDCC> you dont need it
<Proto> :O
<drfsupercenter> 03W7 still has the X-buttons on the right
<junh1024-XDCC> its not productive
<drfsupercenter> 03which is nice
<drfsupercenter> 03not the left
<drfsupercenter> 03what dock thing
<OMG> Okay, forget the transparency, but it looks a lot like Mac OSX.
<drfsupercenter> 03My 7 looks just like XP
<junh1024-XDCC> but u still dont use classic
<BPzeBanshee> 06You know what? My OS is the best.
<BPzeBanshee> 06Mine fixed the oil spill.
<BPzeBanshee> 06:P
<Proto> oh
<Proto> Didn't notice that
<Proto> lol
<BPzeBanshee> 06It can fix anything.

<Proto> hmm
<Proto> okay
<drfsupercenter> 03meh classic theme
<Proto> and I moved the waste basket
<drfsupercenter> 03I like Aero, just not the giant icons
<Proto> Now to get into that Safe
<OMG> Linux is annoying to install though, but live CD fixes that
<junh1024-XDCC> it takes up less screen space & ram than aero
<drfsupercenter> 03I have 8GB of RAM
<Stitch> Proto, sally, if you guys ever get bored/finish that game, try Out Of Order.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't care

<sally> what do u do with the waste basket?
<Stitch> It's actually quite fun. :o
<Proto> You put it under the lamp

<Armageddon> 02They've just met each other
<Armageddon> 02They can relate, but they're not exactly friends
<Armageddon> 02and Draconis is still pretty cold towards Tukh
*Soyuz shrugs
<Soyuz> Tukh is somewhat insane
<Soyuz> he believes friends are those on the battlefield that dont die
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Soyuz> so yesh
<Soyuz> I put CHAOS influnece there
<Soyuz> plus he lived in a guilmon triber
<Soyuz> *tribe

<Soyuz> oooh

<Soyuz> so Wyvern barks at you?
<Drake> 04k
<Drake> 04lolyes
<Soyuz> Wyvern; wait, I go after him?
<Soyuz> or not?
<Wyvern> 02Special Abilities: Can use a variation of Garurumon's Howling Blaster attack. This attack, called Drawback Vortex WindstreamBlades, is a powerful wind attack where Seairyn-X opens his mouth and lets forth a stream of wind, which is 'sharpened' into a multitude of blades, and can damage enemies extensively. Seairyn-X rarely uses this attack, since it uses a lot of energy and can result in him falling unconscious.
<Wyvern> 02and that's drawback vortex windstreamblades
<Drake> 04it's also superultralongnameworld out here
<Wyvern> 02You should basically
<Wyvern> 02get Jesaan to stop everything
<Wyvern> 02and stop Key from fighting or something
<Wyvern> 02then basically we hear the battle
<Wyvern> 02the other battle
<Wyvern> 02between chronomon
<Drake> 04k
<Wyvern> 02and Draconis and Tukh

<Glacymr> 12Banana Cream Pie Fat Free Yogert is too much of an insane idea
<Quanyails> 7Uh?
<Glacymr> 12i guess the randomness blew your mind as well

<Quanyails> 7-.
<Glacymr> 12very well
<Steve> 12 Hello, ChanServ and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> hai hai
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> are you on chat articuno
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> you see me
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> guess not lol
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> im random
<Soyuz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=entxRuZwaUY
<Quanyails> 7You seem to be forgetting capitalization and punctuation.
<Glacymr> 12you forgot grammar Quanyails
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> lol
<Quanyails> 7Eh, Sky doesn't seem to fail in that.
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> who likes this sig i made? http://a.imageshack.us/img683/1319/pokemonsigniturearticun.jpg
<Glacymr> 12guess not lol <--- is not a proper sentence
<Glacymr> 12has no noun
<Quanyails> 7Neither does that. ^
<Glacymr> 12better than anything i can do sky
<Quanyails> 7And Sky, that's rather large for a sig.
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> lol
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> it is the direct link
<Quanyails> 7And you saved it as a JPG...
<Quanyails> 7Are you going to learn or not? :/
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> everyone is complaing! stop complaining! please!
<Espeon> jpg has it's uses... but I'm yet to find them
*Espeon hides
<Glacymr> 12what's the difference between jpg and jpeg
<Glacymr> 12besides one letter
<Quanyails> 7One's an abbreviation for another.
<Glacymr> 12i see
<Espeon> What Quan said. If you save/rename a jpeg as jpg it doesn't say "Renaming this might yada yada"
<Glacymr> 12Jpegs are good
<Glacymr> 12they aren't so much for quality but they are low memory so they load faster for webpages D:
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> ...
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> oh...
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> but i like it
<Quanyails> 7It lowers quality, Sky.
<Quanyails> 7Unless you use high-quality JPGs. :P
<Espeon> and then you pretty much lose the memory-saving benefit
*Espeon hides
<Soyuz> Commandante Che Guevara~
<Glacymr> 12each picture format has it's purpose
<Glacymr> 12Tiffs are meant to be fun :D
<Espeon> tga allows for lulzy moments in Valve games with "sprays"
<Espeon> .vtf as well
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12i read that as wtf
<Espeon> i do every time
<Glacymr> 12es
<Glacymr> 12Espeon do you have steam?
<Espeon> Why yes, I almost never play anything though xD
<Glacymr> 12either way
<Glacymr> 12i'm going to find it
<Glacymr> 12and add it *evil grin*
<Espeon> well hang on
<Espeon> or well I went on CS:S and got achievements vs bots yesterday. It cured a few hours of boredom
<Soyuz> Espeon; you should create a game
<Soyuz> about floof wars o3o
<Espeon> o-o
<Glacymr> 12i see
<Espeon> http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xelig00n
<Espeon> there you go Glacymr
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7Steam, eh?
*Quanyails 7pokes Espeon with Eversion.
<Espeon> With what?
<Glacymr> 12hmm Espeon
<Glacymr> 12i'm having problems adding you
<Espeon> lol wut
<Glacymr> 12well i'm not getting an alert i added you
<Quanyails> 7Eversion.
<Quanyails> 7Steam game?
<Glacymr> 12and when i manually try to add you, it says it can't find your account
<Espeon> Accepted
<Espeon> Never heard of it Quan
*Glacymr accepts you
<Quanyails> 7Really?
<Quanyails> 7Fun game. :P
<Espeon> Yeah, but then again I went of steam for the first time in like a year yesterday
<Quanyails> 7It's, I think, five dollars on Steam.
<Quanyails> 7There's a free version, but it doesn't have achievements or time trials.
<Quanyails> 7And lower graphics.
<Glacymr> 12thanks Espeon
<Espeon> lolwut lower graphics on a trial
<Glacymr> 12you helped me find LLOTS
<Glacymr> 12and Jerry
<Espeon> xD
<Quanyails> 7Can I recommend you play the game without seeing the video or achievements for it? :)
<Quanyails> 7(If you do at all?)
<Espeon> Doesn't look to interesting to me, but if I ever reach critical levels of boredom I'll give it priority :P
<Espeon> great, my key is acting silly
<Espeon> ...
<Espeon> o key*
<Quanyails> 7Eh, you won't believe it.
<Quanyails> 7If you lurk around my deviantART, you'll see why I recommend it.
<Espeon> I already looked up gameplay videos + info on it.
<Quanyails> 7Well, that basically ruins the point of the game.
<Espeon> Hawkieeeeeeeeee also
<Espeon> lol how could I know
<Hawkie> Hi
<Quanyails> 7Have you seen peoples' reactions toward it?
<Espeon> I've seen a bit, but I generally only play games that looks interesting to me. I know very well I will/ I am missing out on many good games, but it's just a habit
<Quanyails> 7Yep. I play unique games.
<Quanyails> 7Eversion, VVVVVV, recently refreshed on Windosill.
<Quanyails> 7Audiosurf, lol.
<Espeon> I'm not one of those people only playing mainstream games though, but I've had experiences where games have been ... bad but still people go "OMG ITS SO GOOD" just because it's unique. Audiosurf is a good one though, but I just don't play many games on PC.... over the last year++
<Quanyails> 7GUEST
<Espeon> Tails
<IcyNinetales> 02Hi Quanyails! ^^
<Quanyails> 7So your opinion on Eversion is...
<Espeon> I dunno, haven't played it. I just don't get that "I want to try this" feeling so I won't try it unless I naturally and individually decide to try it out.
<Quanyails> 7But I meant from what you've seen--those videos and the like.
*IcyNinetales will brb
<Espeon> It looks like a good time waster at least.
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, all right.
<Hawkie> Heh
<Hawkie> I like Audiosurf o.O

<Quanyails> 7Well, Tiel hasn't returned at the mo'.
<Light_Lati> shes not usually like this tho o.o
<Articuno> 12I gave it like 30 seconds then banned
<Articuno> 12If anyone figures out whether that's actually that person or not, let us know
<Xai> 05DRF what i don't get about american cars is that american companies make some great cars - heck, i drive an american car - but for some reason they don't sell them in america
*Aristeo sits between Tricky and Kitten
<Light_Lati> Xai
<Light_Lati> drf left lol
<Quanyails> 7Because foreign cars are popular?
<Stitch> :o
<Xai> 05didn't notice, lol
<Quanyails> 7I'm still patrolling for any sign of Tiel. O3o
*Light_Lati gives Xai its glasses? o3o
*Light_Lati hides
<Xai> 05example - my car is like 7 years old and still gets over 50mpg with a 2l engine and a top speed of like 140 or so.
<Espeon> you can't write patrolling without trol- okay that's just a bad one Dx
<Articuno> 12Don't bother, considering they used the word "balls" after they got killed for swearing RIGHT after they were yelling about how they didn't do anything, I'd say it's Tiel having a laugh
<Kyu> 07lol
<Kyu> 07that doesn't sound accurate
<Kyu> 07unless it's diesel o3o
<Xai> 05it is
<Quanyails> 7Hi, Alt.
<Altair> Just heard something went on in here as well lol
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Articuno> 12Just Tiel swearing LOL
<Articuno> 12The usual, they swear, they die :3
<Espeon> Well Arti, if you saw what she did on HoR. It wouldn't be "just"...
<Altair> Arti, at least she wasn't an oper :)
*Espeon hides
<Xai> 05unless you wanted performance, why have a petrol/gas car?
<Kyu> 07half the standard cars here are 2 liter engines that can't go much faster than 120 and don't get 50mpg
<Articuno> 12LOL Espeon
<Altair> added half of the people on my server to akill lol
<Espeon> basically banned everyone
<Quanyails> 7Egads, indeed.
<Articuno> 12I read before, ROFL
<Andrew> http://comixed.com/2009/05/30/diesel-humor/
<Xai> 05exactly - i mean why don't they have them in the US?
<Espeon> xD
<Altair> Anyway just checking in etc
<Articuno> 12LOL AT PIC
<Kyu> 07they do
<Kyu> 07they're just more expensive and so is diesel gas
<Articuno> 12Ok, why does no one buy them then? XD
<Articuno> 12Americans are on about price and cars now?!
<Articuno> 12Wouldn't it make sense to buy an economic car then? :3
<Xai> 05But that is the funniest thing - when someone buys a 4-ton hummer and then gets it with a petrol engine for 'performance' - i mean seriously, why bother? it's like having an office block with a fan attached to the side that burns money for power.
<Kyu> 07if it cost 150% more than a regular gas car, then yes lol
<Kyu> 07and people don't buy those anymore o3o
<Xai> 05typically you get about 2 times the fuel efficiency so you save the enviroment and money too. win-win
<Articuno> 12How much more expensive is Diesel over there by the way?
<Xai> 05oh and of course longer range so you have to fill up less
<Xai> 05and diesels are less expensive to maintain
<Light_Lati> ohai Lugianite
<Kyu> 07the cheapest diesel car is a vw jetta and costs 30k
<Lugianite> hi
<Lugianite> hi Xai
<Xai> 0530k??????
<Articuno> 12Then why don't they sell Mondeos?
<Articuno> 12ZS
<Light_Lati> you missed insanity o3o
<Kyu> 07while a prius costs 22k
<Xai> 05wtf?

<Aristeo> :o
<Xai> 05yeah, cash too - no mortgage
<Andrew> there's no point buying a new car when you can get one slightly used and save several thousand
<Xai> 05sucks, i want a house
<Articuno> 12We have a house :3 but it's not ours technically LOL
<Xai> 05i got mine for Â£3700 (new was Â£17,800) for 3 years old
<Articuno> 12Andrew, RN bought a car on loan, a brand new one. She's still paying it back :(
<Andrew> oh god
<Kyu> 07well duh o3o
<Lugianite> Loans are bad
<Kyu> 07it takes at least 5 years to pay off a car in full
<Articuno> 12Totally depends on the price, interest and your wage :3
<Articuno> 12It could be a year if you want
<Lugianite> bleh
<Andrew> finance is just as bad
<Kyu> 07it could, but few people have the money
<Articuno> 12I wouldn't buy a car if I didn't have the money.
<Articuno> 12Then again..
<Kyu> 07then by that logic nearly every american would be walking
<Andrew> i know a guy that bought a fiesta which was just over 10 grand new, except he chose the finance option and ended up paying more like 15 grand over time
<Light_Lati> Kyu
<Articuno> 12Kyu, thats what people do here LOL
<Andrew> a friggen fiesta
<Light_Lati> or biking
<Lugianite> lol
<Articuno> 12But I was about to say, public transport doesn't exist over there does it? LOL
<Kyu> 07well the US is big
<Xai> 05i don't get why all people in america want to own giant trucks - i mean do you all have cows you need to transport or something? Having said that people in the UK are going that way too.
<Kyu> 07public transport doesn't scale up well
<Articuno> 12Yeh but driving through the whole of the US is like saying I'll drive through all of Europe
<Articuno> 12You don't drive out your state/country much do you?
<Lugianite> I would like to
<Lugianite> sounds like an adventure
<Articuno> 12You certainly don't get jobs outside your state unless you're on a border lol
<Articuno> 12Or can afford to travel.
<Kyu> 07the typical commute is an hour from suburb to city
<Kyu> 07and public transport is mainly local
<Articuno> 12Sounds like here
<Andrew> people who drive pickup trucks must be compensating for something
<Articuno> 12People commute, we just have transport to do it with :>
<Andrew> :P
<Quanyails> o3o
<Articuno> 12Andrew LOL yes.. ok
<Articuno> 12Maybe their paycheck *runs*
<Kyu> 07like I said, public transport isn't big here
<Xai> 05"Yes, i'd like a car that costs twice as much as a regular car, has much worse fuel economy, top speed and power, handling, also that i can't park easily and have to reach up 4 feet just to load the trunk and costs 3 times as much to service."
<Andrew> ha
<Xai> 05public transport has it's uses
<Kyu> 07if you're taking a bus in SF, then you aren't going anywhere except within SF
<Kyu> 07which is why everyone takes cars
<Articuno> 12No one takes buses to get around the country here, it's train.
<Xai> 05i always think that an integrated system is best - it's not cost effective to have public transport to every hoime but likewise it's silly for people to sit in jams in the city
<Kyu> 07since out of the dozens of cities surrounding SF, there's no public transport lines into the city
<Quanyails> New York, New York...
<Articuno> 12Train is generally long distance, buses short
<Kyu> 07well the bay area has bart
<Quanyails> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewYorkSubway
<Articuno> 12I wonder why they never built any proper transport links there
<Quanyails> Yes, TV Tropes has an article on that. O_o
<Quanyails> 7And my color somehow asploded.
<Xai> 05the ideal system is where you get a car to a station and say a train into the center. easy parking, lots quicker and no stress (if it was an ideal world)
<Kyu> 07but even then there aren't enough stops
<Andrew> like park n ride
<Kyu> 07that is the bay area's system lol
<Xai> 05certainly not la's
<Articuno> 12Im gonna go ^^
*Articuno wants to learn to drive now XD
<Xai> 05ok, bye ra!
<Light_Lati> awww
<Articuno> 12Â¬Â¬
<Light_Lati> bai Arti~
<Quanyails> 7Bye, Arti?
<Xai> 05:D
<Quanyails> 7I drew an Artifox.
<Kyu> 07the bay has the best train system in the US since it isn't as crowded or complicated
<Light_Lati> and goid luck~
*Articuno drags Xai
<Quanyails> 7(Lol?)
<Articuno> 12Ohh XD show me later
<Light_Lati> *good

<Michel> :)
<Aristeo> Awww. The "Antoine Dodson" meme where the guy intruded into that girl's room seems to be more popular than the Struttin video :(
*Aristeo only took one picture of that
<Light_Lati> Kuro o3o
<Kuro_Link> sup LL
<Light_Lati> Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiink
<Aristeo> Scary ghetto is scary >.<
<Light_Lati> brb
<Kuro_Link> k
<Aristeo> You couldn't imagine how much hate was pouring into the car from people on their porches staring at us as we drove by
<Roxas> Quanyails, Espeon what's up
<Espeon> Not much
<Roxas> sometimes nothing is better
<Aristeo> It's the same feeling when you're inside and it's like 70 F / 20 C in your house, and you step outside into 100 F / 36 C weather -- it's that same feeling, almost like getting hit with a shockwave
<Roxas> i for one look forward to a nice easy day of little to no significance
<Roxas> kinda hard with all the new pokemon from gen 5 that have been announced
<Lugianite> blech
<Lugianite> another generation
<sally> lol
<sally> you poor thing
<Roxas> there was a sudden boom of info yesterday i guess
<Roxas> and today
<Espeon> what Lugianite said pretty much
*Aristeo was brave enough to take exactly one picture
<Lugianite> they should have stopped at 2 or 3
<Espeon> but well well, the internet itself advertises Pokemon for free if they just give a little info (as in Zorua+Zoroark)
<Espeon> Yes. lolol
<Lugianite> 4 sucked
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked 3
<drfsupercenter> 03RSE was the best games
<Espeon> that's quite an original opinion
<Roxas> sup drf, yes 3rd/1st gen were my faves
<Lugianite> and 5, I am sorry, you hav a flippen clown for a starter
<Espeon> and not even a stealthy one
<Espeon> sorry, move on
<Roxas> i'm still going to play gen 5 for completion sake
<Lugianite> bleh, I wouldn't
<Lugianite> I have not touched a 4th gen
<Espeon> Well Roxas, that's why they keep making them.
<Lugianite> not even for SS or HG
<Aristeo> :#
<Aristeo> :3
<Roxas> anyone seen Hawkie today ?
<Lugianite> yes
<Espeon> No matter how much people complain they still buy them. And yes
<Roxas> @ Espeon true
<Espeon> ---> she's around there
<Hawkie> Yep
*Aristeo spins sally round round baby like a record baby round round round round
<Lugianite> lol
<Hawkie> I'm here.
<sally> "hide your wives, kids, boyfriends, husbands, everybody is getting raped out here"
<Roxas> hey Hawkie :)
<Hawkie> Hi Roxas ^v^
<Hawkie> Were you looking for me?
<Roxas> yea just seeing if you were on
<Lugianite> gens 1 and 2 will always be true for me
<Aristeo> D:
<sally> xD
<Lugianite> 3 is pushing the barrier
<sally> that's what he said in a diff interview
<Lugianite> after 3, I lost touch with it
<Aristeo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJv5qLsLYoo
<Roxas> 4th was the low point of the series
<Roxas> 5th intends to go lower
<Lugianite> yup
<Roxas> 6th will kill the series
<Espeon> a steady decline
<Hawkie> Yeah I'm here
<Hawkie> lol
<Aeroslash> my mouse is being dumb =( *random*
<Lugianite> 2 was the highest point
<Roxas> how are you today Hawkie ?
<sally> idk where my headphones are and i cant play it cuz my cousin is still sleep
<Hawkie> Doing alright I suppose.
<Lugianite> I loved G/S/C
<Hawkie> Things are a bit up in the air right now.
<Hawkie> You?
<Roxas> just trying to have a lazy sunday i suppose
<Aristeo> okies
<Roxas> Hawkie do you expect 5th gen to even be decent ?
<Hawkie> No.
<Hawkie> Not at all =P
<Aristeo> It's a cool song :3
<Espeon> decent is pushing it
<Roxas> i can't say that i like too many of the new pokemon
<Hawkie> I'm not getting the new games. ^^;Â¨
<Hawkie> Neh
<Espeon> like, pushing it with the force of a nuclear blast
<Hawkie> I like the pigeon one
<Roxas> i like the new grass starter and then i also like zekrom that's about it
<Roxas> oh and Zorua was kinda cool
<Lugianite> sorry, I like my original fox better, Ninetails
<Aristeo> That girl in the you dun goofed video is kind of cute -- I can't believe she's not like 18 or 19
<Roxas> i just don't want to get to the point where we have like 10 versions of a species in this case foxes
<Aristeo> Or at least 16
<Stitch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbPuTwo1bxs
<Lugianite> well, we have bout 10 in birds :P
<Stitch> Very well-made music video.
<Espeon> Zorua is okay, but Vulpix and Eevee beats it ever day |3
<Lugianite> or more
<Roxas> if you said fox pokemon originally ppl would know what you were talking about
<Lugianite> and yesh
<Roxas> now they ask which gen
<sally> Aristeo: what you dun goofed vid?
<Roxas> make new species Nintendo instead of more of the same
<Lugianite> Roxas : thats cause the nintendo people love their cash cow
<Roxas> and i agree there are WAY too many birds now
<Aristeo> ummm
<Roxas> the next gen alone introduces about 5
<Lugianite> lol
<Aristeo> That girl who you said "no, she's definitely 11" and I'm like "well, she LOOKS like she's 16-19"
<Roxas> SO FAR
<Roxas> we've yet to see the entire pokedex for 5th gen
<Lugianite> I have been done since gen 3
<sally> the girl with the crazy dad? o.O
<Aristeo> Yeah
<Espeon> in the world of money there is no "retiring when you're at the top"
<Lugianite> with exceptions, Leafeon and Glaceon, which *were* concepts by gen 2
<sally> you think that bratty crazy chick is cute?
<Roxas> This is my graThe trainer blocked the ball! I2" <----- btw call me slow but finally i get this, i actually took the time to look into it
<Espeon> well Eeveelutions
<Espeon> |3
<Aristeo> Well...... she's cute if you turn off the sound
<Roxas> the infamous 59 error
<Lugianite> yes
<Aristeo> And pretend she's at least 16
<Roxas> i've never really seen it in game tho
<Tricky> yeah, she has an adorable voice if you just don't listen to it :3
<sally> whatever floats ur boat
<Roxas> i guess it takes hacking/cheating ?
<Lugianite> I have, after running a magnet over it :p
<Lugianite> ruined the game though
<Espeon> yay for glitches that can't be abused and are just funny
<Roxas> missingno is worse
<sally> Stitch: is that the movie 7lbs.?
<Lugianite> I love Missingno
<Roxas> tho 'm is even worse than Missingno
<Aristeo> Archimedes' Principle makes my boat float
<Lugianite> inf nuggets
<Lugianite> ^-^
<Espeon> suddenly money
<Lugianite> yes
<Roxas> but why is 5th gen purposely using the #000 slot ?
<Roxas> for a pokemon
<Stitch> sally, I think so.
<Lugianite> because nintendo no longer cares
<Espeon> it would be more lulzy if you could do it like before doing the first gym. That would be silly, breezing through with rare candy leveld Pokemans
<Stitch> Aristeo, XD
<Lugianite> lol
<Roxas> connection perhaps, maybe it was planned all along ?
<Roxas> either that or they're doing it to prevent any glitch abuse
<Roxas> i'm sure they no longer store the player's name in the pokemon data, that was just a bad idea to begin with
<Lugianite> yeah
<Stitch> Aristeo, did you watch it? :o
<Lugianite> but thy should stop
<Aristeo> Yes'm
<Espeon> Many of those glitches really makes them look like lazy programmers
<Stitch> ..And wait, wasn't the Archimedes principle about the water screw or something?
<Lugianite> I loved missingno
<sally> pretty good vid
<Roxas> even as late as gen iv we still have bad glitches
<Espeon> like yeah... storing temporary data in weird places
<sally> and movie
<Roxas> invisible shiny bulbasaur anyone ?
<Stitch> Never seen the movie.
<Aristeo> Archimedes' principle is basically the physics behind buoyancy
<Lugianite> lol
<Stitch> Ah.
<Aristeo> "Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid."
<Roxas> i've seen it in game through code use
<Aristeo> and "Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."
<Aristeo> Thus, that's what floats my boat
<Roxas> so Gen V is probably going to have it's own share of glitches
<sally> interesting
*Aristeo nods
<Aristeo> It's physics ^_^
<Roxas> what would be truly bad would be if they somehow restored missingo, tho i'm still all for the idea of making the official glitch type pokemon
<Roxas> maybe something involving porygon ?
*Stitch was thinking of the Archimedes screw. :o
<Lugianite> I just want them to stop
<Roxas> corruption perhaps ?
<Light_Lati> g2g
<Lugianite> k
<Light_Lati> BBL~
<Roxas> bye LL
<Aristeo> You got gravity all like "IMMA KEEP YOU DOWN RAWRAWRRAWR"
<Aristeo> And then buoyancy is all like "I'm never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down"
<Roxas> come on corruption of porygon would atleast be kind of a cool concept
<Lugianite> yeah
<Lugianite> but they should just stop making the series
<Roxas> and having a safe glitch-type version would be a wonderful homage to gen 1
<Espeon> lol corruption of Porygon
<Espeon> irl virus pokemon anyone?
<Roxas> Nintendo told ppl not to go after missingno but this just made ppl more intrigued
<Aristeo> It also has a bit of the third law of physics in there two
<Lugianite> yeah
<Roxas> i remember seeking out missingo when Nintendo put the warning up
<Tricky> Newton's third?
<sally> bye!
<Roxas> is bad egg officially a used bit of coding to prevent hacking/cheating ?
<Lugianite> yes
<Roxas> i've always wondered if gamefreak/nintendo put that in on purpose
<Roxas> considering it's been in every gen except gen 1 (R/B/Y) that was good evidence for
<Roxas> ah ok i see now so it really is an anti-cheat programming
<Aristeo> Yeah
<Lugianite> Yellow had no missingno
<Aristeo> That one :3
<Roxas> yes it did
*Aristeo noms on physics
<Lugianite> RBG did
<Roxas> Pokemon Yellow had yellow missingo
<Lugianite> yellow was spared the programming
<Roxas> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingo#Yellow_Version_form
<Aeroslash> Yellow Amarillo is an awesome chracter
<Lugianite> yes
<Roxas> missingo is in yellow
<Roxas> missingno*
<Aeroslash> Green, she's awesome
<Roxas> sorry i typed that way too fast my bad
<Aeroslash> but she never was in the games =(
<Aeroslash> it's ok, I type fast too
<Roxas> i ruined my blue version catching too many missingno
<Roxas> it says the game data has been destroyed and can't be used :(
<Aeroslash> D:
<Aeroslash> that sucks
<Roxas> so yes i've come face to face with one of the most severe error codes there is
<Espeon> o-O
<Espeon> well, at least it displayed that error code correctly
*Espeon hides
<Roxas> hmm apparently yellow missingno is WAY MORE DANGEROUS
<Roxas> behold the horror that is yellow missingno http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/3/3e/000Y.png
<Espeon> we will not survive
<Tricky> Uh
<Tricky> Bye, sally :o
*Aeroslash kabooms
<Aeroslash> I died
<Lugianite> I lovd Green <3
<Aeroslash> Green is epic :D
<Aeroslash> she actually kind of looks like me irl
<Lugianite> x3
<Aeroslash> but with shorter hair
<Lugianite> cute
<Aeroslash> awws
<Aeroslash> I'm really not that cute ^^;;
<Lugianite> I had a crush on green for a long while while and after reading the comics
<Lugianite> x3
<Aeroslash> I looovee those comics
<Aeroslash> it's my Ravers Fantasy
*Aeroslash is SHOT
<Lugianite> yesh
<Tricky> Fluid physics always escaped me
<Roxas> ok got it glitch talk over my bad
<Aeroslash> you pulled dah trigger? D:
*Quanyails 7is back.
<Aeroslash> hi Quan
<Tricky> Never had the dedication to try and wrap my head around how and why stuff floats :p
<Roxas> sorry i get carried away when it comes to discussing glitch pokemon
<Aeroslash> it's alright
<Lugianite> yeah
<Aeroslash> we all have our clicks
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
*Quanyails 7awaits Aurora.
<Quanyails> 7!generate 1 2
<Altafk> 1
<Lugianite> like how I love Latias' for having so many forms and cute looks
<Quanyails> 7Science it is!
<Aeroslash> Latias is cool
<Espeon> :3
<Roxas> Latias has a decent amount of forms i suppose
<Lugianite> she is like a ditto
<Aeroslash> yup
<Lugianite> just not gooey
<drfsupercenter> 03except Dittos are pimps
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aeroslash> yup
<Aeroslash> lol
<Lugianite> lol drf got that right
<Aeroslash> a pimp ditto
<Aeroslash> XD
<Roxas> kinda pathetic but until my friend told me yesterday i didn't know mew could transform
<Aeroslash> O.O
<Aeroslash> oh wow
<Aeroslash> XD
<Lugianite> lol Mew ftw
<Espeon> Ditto is the pimp's dream.
<Espeon> that simple
<Aeroslash> Shiny Mew is ftw
<Lugianite> yes Espeon
<Roxas> which would mean ditto is the closest to mew then ?
<Lugianite> that it is
<Lugianite> and maybe
<Aeroslash> Ditto should secretly evolve into Mew >:D
<Lugianite> lol
<Lugianite> I wonder... what happens in that daycare
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl
<Aeroslash> things that we're obviously not supposed to know
<Aeroslash> XD
<Aeroslash> bye drf~
<Lugianite> lol
<Espeon> Whoever sees what happens in daycare is picked up in a black van and never seen again.
<Espeon> so yeah the daycare man is blind
<Aeroslash> ROFL
<Aeroslash> that explains a lot
<Roxas> i wonder if legends will ever breed
<Roxas> probably not
<Aristeo> Fluids are strange
<Espeon> they do. But it doesn't work.
<Espeon> =O
<Aeroslash> well
<Aeroslash> they don't on the game for a reason
<Aeroslash> super powerful pokemon.....
<Roxas> maintain rarity ?
<Aeroslash> and that too
<Espeon> yeah, like people don't just pokesav them
*Espeon dies
<Roxas> that still shouldn't prevent younger versions of the legends idk
<Kyu> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 11 minutes
<Roxas> ?
<Espeon> A nest full of Lugia
<Aeroslash> cute
*Aeroslash is the smallest floofburd in the bunch
<Aeroslash> ^^

<Aeroslash> but I pronouce it "Art-ih" though
<Aeroslash> like "Art-ih-cuno"
<Espeon> xD
<Aeroslash> well, that's how I pronouce Articuno
<Articuno|Away> 12Yeh but that's American

<Quanyails> 7Yeep.
<Roxas> tvtropes is win
<Roxas> i could read articles on there all day
<Espeon> I'll just say what I always say: That I don't see the appeal of that site.
<Espeon> And then just poof
<Quanyails> 7You do click on the links, right?
<Roxas> i clicked the link
<Quanyails> 7Well, links to other pages in TV TRopes.
<Espeon> I've tried, but it just leaves me thinking "Why the hell am I wasting my time on something I don't find funny, interesting or anything?" and then I close the window :3
<Quanyails> 7Tropes*
<Quanyails> 7The tropes themselves, Espy?
<Kjakings> 7Omegle is funtimes
<Espeon> I guess I just don't find the ... I dunno, layout/presentation, humor... anything over there appealing o3o
<Quanyails> 7I find the layout very useful. :P
<Quanyails> 7You can disguise it as actual data. >>
<Espeon> well, I just wanted to state my opinion and poof o3o
<Lugianite> back
<Espeon> wb
<Roxas> does anyone here enjoy tvtropes for the actual tropes ?
<Roxas> i find them highly interesting
<Damos> 13Look at a da I submitted just now
<Quanyails> 7Yes, Roxas.
<Quanyails> 7TV Tropes is HUGE.
<Damos> 13http://pokedamos.deviantart.com/art/Hate-to-see-that-in-Morning-173602258?q=sort%3Atime+gallery%3Apokedamos&qo=0
<Roxas> it's cool being able to look up almost any concept used in a show you want and find other shows that use it
<Roxas> and how they use it
<Quanyails> 7I'd say stick it in scraps.
<Damos> 13brb shower
*Quanyails 7nods.
<Quanyails> 7TVTropesWillEnhanceYourLife, indeed.
<Quanyails> 7I've managed to stick Egregious into my vocabulary.
<Roxas> that or waste your life away xD
<Quanyails> 7Meh, the former.
<Quanyails> 7Except that EVERY 'dramatic' moment in media is now narmy.
<Aristeo> Stitch!
<Stitch> Aristeo!
<Roxas> welcome back Hawkie
<Tricky> Tricky!
<Hawkie> thank you Roxas ^^
<Aristeo> :D
<Tricky> So, Aristeo, internet pilgrimage sounds like it was fun
<Tricky> You got any plans for somewhere else to plgrimagitise to?
*Aristeo shakes his head
<Tricky> Aw :(
<Tricky> Well, if you do end up going somewhere else, I'd be interested to hear about it :D
<Roxas> slow day on TST it would seem
<Quanyails> 7Not quite.
<Quanyails> 7We had... activity earlier.
<Roxas> i suppose
<Roxas> but now we've kinda hit a dead point in the day
<Aristeo> Thanks :D
<Quanyails> 7Yes, currently is.
<Quanyails> 7I'm gonna work on Floofspeon.
<Stitch> Wat was I tabbed for? :o

<RedDragonX> !random
<Steve> Steve always is noisy and is often being freaky
<Espeon> o.o
<Espeon> OH
<Quanyails> 7Hey.
<Espeon> Hey
<Quanyails> 7For your sprite, you have a :3 face.
<Quanyails> 7Is that fine with you?
<Espeon> ... YES
<Espeon> xD
<Espeon> that's win
<Quanyails> 7And I'm wondering whether to floof your ears or not.
<Quanyails> 7They sorta look like pine cones.
<Espeon> o3o
<Espeon> tail needs to be sorta fuzzy, not too floofy. floof is for chests, fuzz for the rest
*Espeon hides
<Quanyails> 7http://uploads.mibbit.com/MwCpOl.png <-- Well, that's what I have so far. (Sprite dump, left corner.
<Espeon> FFFFFFFf <3
<Roxas> @ Quanyails looks cool
<Espeon> ears seems to possibly come better off without the fluffiness o3o
<Quanyails> 7'kay, Espy.
*Quanyails 7deletes.
<Roxas> oh that's cool i didn't know mibbit did uploads
<Roxas> is it like temp storage or something ?
<Espeon> just make them a bit thicker than usual, or just normal x3
<Roxas> ok ignored that's fine
<Quanyails> 7Eh, Art.
<Quanyails> 7And Roxas, it's, well, uploads.
<Roxas> permanent or not ?
<Quanyails> 7I'dn't think so, as pastebin entries disappear after time.
<Espeon> sooner or later they tend to magically 404
<Roxas> ah
<Quanyails> 7http://uploads.mibbit.com/XaqTVu.png <-- Better?
<Espeon> oh YES :3
<Quanyails> 7Yay. :D
<Quanyails> 7Onto the colors.
<Quanyails> 7But first, painting. o.O
<Aeroslash> gonna go, bye all
<Quanyails> 7Bye!
<Quanyails> 7D :
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Quanyails> 7Blas you, paintbrush in one hand, keyboard under another.
<Espeon> oo
<Roxas> what are you making anyways Quanyails ?
<Quanyails> 7My painting, you mean>
<Quanyails> 7?*
<Roxas> yea
<Quanyails> 7An eagle and owl.
<Quanyails> 7It was originally gonna be one or the other, but...
<Roxas> cool
<Roxas> what happened ?
<Quanyails> 7I drew both.
<Roxas> what inspired that change
<Roxas> ?*
<RedDragonX> screw you Steve
<Quanyails> 7I took a third option instead of one or the other.
<Roxas> ah ok
<Prince-dari> Lol, I got banned?
<Prince-dari> Lol.
<Prince-dari> Hey RDX.
<RedDragonX> HIYA
<RedDragonX> oops all caps
<RedDragonX> where you been
<Prince-dari> Well I was on holiday.
<Espeon> long story short, something weird happened
<Prince-dari> We went to France - the Normandy area.
<Espeon> either someone went apeshit or that person got hacked
<Prince-dari> So how are you?
<RedDragonX> ahhh
<RedDragonX> been busy
<Roxas> oh wow articuno accept my facebook friend req :)
<Roxas> accepted*
<Roxas> i should feel pretty lucky right
<Prince-dari> Oh, ok. O_o
<Quanyails> 7Well, Arti's just a normal person.
<Roxas> i've rarely been able to befriend the owner of sites before tho
<Espeon> lol facebook
<Roxas> google is apparently coming out with their own competitor for facebook
<Roxas> google me is what it might be called
<Roxas> and back to the whole facebook thing ppl post personal stuff on their facebooks that they don't want just anyone seeing
<Lugianite> wb sheena ^-^
<SheenaFox> Thanks
<Roxas> so it's a real sign of trust/friendship
<Roxas> and wb
<Roxas> i don't believe we have been properly introduced *holds out hand* i'm Roxas
<Roxas> err right *pulls hand back* oh well
<Roxas> sorry for that SheenaFox i was wrong to assume we were even close to friends
<SheenaFox> Oh
<SheenaFox> Hi
<SheenaFox> For some reason I thought you were talking to someone else
<Roxas> hey how's it going
<SheenaFox> It's going fine, you?
<Roxas> err you're the only person here i've yet to meet, fine too i suppose just abit bored
<SheenaFox> !lag
<Altair> [SheenaFox] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 1.108secs
<Michel> good night everyone
<Michel> good night all
<Espeon> nini :3
<Roxas> so Quanyails it's a pretty big deal to have you make sprites ?, looks like you have to win the priv ?
<Quanyails> 7Priv?
<Roxas> priviledge* meh how ever it's spelled
<Roxas> i always shorten it to priv
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, but privilege?
*Altair prods Sneas :<
<Quanyails> 7If you mean Espeon's gift, it's the other way around.
*SuperiorLeafeon pokes Espeon o3o
<Quanyails> 7I give art as gifts, rewards, and the like. My opinion, basically.
<Quanyails> 7If other people want me to draw something, I let them go through a small trial.
<Espeon> o.o
<Drake> 04morning
<Roxas> how much do you charge for a completed project?
<Espeon> o.o
<Espeon> and hihi Drake :3
<Roxas> what sprites can you do
<Drake> 04hi Espeon
<Altair> hey Drake
<Drake> 04hey Altair
<Espeon> :3
<Roxas> oh right the contest was for sprites by Quanyails and Lyon so you two make a good team i take it ?
<Lyon> 04?
<Quanyails> 7Well, first:
<Quanyails> 7I don't charge for sprites; I give them if I think the request-er is worthy.
<Roxas> i meant that sprite contest a few days/weeks? back
<Lyon> 04ohthat
<Roxas> worthy oh wow xD well i'm screwed
<Espeon> it's a refined way of saying that she makes them if she feels like it I guess
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quanyails> 7The sprite contest was, well, a contest.
<Quanyails> 7Whoever won could get a sprite--a greater one than I normally do.
<Quanyails> 7 Aero's request was a bit difficult, but I tried.
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of, how's your side coming, Lyon?
<Shahrukh> hello
<Shahrukh> to all
<Shahrukh> !op
<Quanyails> 7Espeon, is it okay if I gave your sprite big ol' chibi eyes?
<Shahrukh> !hop
<Espeon> as long as you keep the floof and the general :3 of it
<Espeon> or well, mostly the floof
<Espeon> silly furball Espeon
<Quanyails> 7Maybe I should just draw dot eyes.
<Quanyails> 7Since :3 has dots.
<Altair> bbl
<Espeon> well I can't see chibi eyes becoming too big with that limited space, I just don't like super huge KAWAII DESU eyes too much. Dot eyes = comic relief though x3
<Quanyails> 7Well, dot eyes:
<Tricky> Hi Shahrukh
<Quanyails> 7http://uploads.mibbit.com/UAh4qx.png
<Shahrukh> #PAKISTAN.ONLINE
<Shahrukh> plz proceed here
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> cool quan

<Sky|ChibiDesigner> damos|pokeshower lol
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Sky|ChibiDesigner for 1 minute
<Quanyails> 7I could have two versions, one with dot eyes and one with chibi ones.
<Espeon> I really can't decide, so it would either be that or you do what you think would be best
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> quan do chibi eyes they are so cute
<Espeon> chibi eyes are okay as long as they're not overdone :P
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> if the fan art page is fixed by cristmas i will be doing a big suprise!
<Sky|ChibiDesigner> but i will ask arty though

<Steve> 12 Hello, sally and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Quanyails> 7I added TEXTURE. o3o
<Arcanine> 04btw hawkie pointed out an obvious glitch lol
<Espeon> oh my
<Arcanine> 04that i wasn't aware of

<Arcanine> 04check my gameplay stats
<Quilava> I don't get it
<Arcanine> 04i played Alien Swarm for about 3-4 hours
<Arcanine> 04does that help?
<Quanyails> 7Eh, I can't get that meme 'It's so fluffy' out of my head as I'm drawing you. X.x
<Quilava> weird
<Arcanine> 04when i closed Alien Swarm
<Arcanine> 04for some reason a process it was running didn't
<Espeon> that sounds promising
<Arcanine> 04so steam thought the game was still running and that i was playing the game even though it wasn't open
<Arcanine> 04so now my playtime for alien swarm is 28 hours XD
<Prince-dari> LOL, that's the best game achievement ever. Tie up a female NPC, then put her on the train tracks, and watch her get squished.
<Espeon> lol Dastardly
<Espeon> Red Dead Redemption
<Espeon> 8D
<Prince-dari> Yep, I'm working on doing all the achievements now. :)
<Aeroslash> Drawing who, Quan?
<Espeon> lol
<Espeon> many are online ones that you need up to 8 people for or something so
<Prince-dari> I finally got all the COD ones, special ops were pretty hard. O_o
<Espeon> I didn't find them too hard in fact. In fact some of the "easier" ones proved hard n.n
<Prince-dari> Meh, I'll just do the single player ones then, I don't think much of the multiplayer.
<Espeon> lol
<Prince-dari> I hated the juggernauts in Favela.
<Espeon> thumper headshot is your friend. Or RUN FAST AND SPAM STUFF for that matter
<Quanyails> 7Espeon, Aero.
<Prince-dari> The one I found hardest was Snatch and Grab though.
<Prince-dari> The one in scrapyard.
<Aeroslash> You're drawing Espeon as an Espeon, right? XP
<Espeon> that one was indeed hard. the end where you jump out of the broken plane... ALWAYS someone survived my sniping there and shot me in the back
<Aeroslash> oh, Quan
<Prince-dari> Yeah.
<Aeroslash> I wish I had a scanner, I just finished drawing Orexa
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7And yes, Aero.
<Aeroslash> she turned out good, too
<Prince-dari> How many IW times did you break? I only got one. XD
<Espeon> my favourite use of MW2 nowadays is tracking down those kids with high-pitched voices and make them mad 8D
<Prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Aeroslash> I'm in kind of a KH fanism X3
<Espeon> easy to do when you're trash to them unless you "quickscope" though.
<Espeon> I've gotten all sorts of threats. Sad really.
<Prince-dari> I like to piss off all the cocky retards. XD
<Stitch> Oh, well.
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Quanyails> 7Wait, did you finish TLS?
<Espeon> Yeah. In general those who take it FAR to seriously = best targets for lulz
<Prince-dari> BRB, starting up my console (My monitor is also my console TV).
<DarkTruth> pretty much lol
<Espeon> xD
<Aeroslash> naw
<Aeroslash> XD
<Aeroslash> I should favorite the link though
*Eithne wants proper apple juice
<Arcanine> 04Prince-dari
<Eithne> None of this squash crap
<Aeroslash> I just have been RPing as Orexa a lot
<Prince-dari> ?
<Arcanine> 04is Red Dead Redemption that good?
<DarkTruth> o_o
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Quanyails> 7Where?
<Aeroslash> with my friend in a PM
<Eithne> you know.
<Aeroslash> I PM RP a lot
<Eithne> diluting juice?
<Eithne> fruit squash?
<Espeon> oo
<Quanyails> 7Who?
<Prince-dari> Well I like it, the story lasts longer than most games do (with my excessive playing XD), but the traveling around can sometimes get a bit boring.
<Prince-dari> Huge map.
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Arcanine> 04i'm usually not a fan of western style anything
<Prince-dari> I wish I'd worked out you can travel from a camp to any waypoint you set earlier in the game. XD
<DarkTruth> yea I think I get you
<Arcanine> 04not to mention it was by rockstar who made GTA which once again wasn't that good
<Eithne> you Americans are weird >:|
<Aeroslash> J
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<Quanyails> 7How do the RPs go?
<Aeroslash> yeah, he's a good RPer
<Aeroslash> epic ^^
<Prince-dari> Have you looked at any online reviews?
<DarkTruth> thank you <3
<Eithne> <3
<Eithne> I wub you DarkTruth
<Aeroslash> why, you wanna RP?
*DarkTruth takes her weird self and jumps on Eithne
<Aeroslash> XD
<DarkTruth> I wub you to xD
<Eithne> :D
*Eithne is on to a winner, methinks
<Prince-dari> Ok, BBL.

<Sneas> 03You was there when it happened o.o
<Altair> I meant what happened on Tiel's end XD
<Tiel> the only thing I can think of
<Tiel> is that someone somehow got them from pastebin
<Tiel> from when NS was helping me with scripts
<Altair> Ugh D:
<Tiel> but those were all set to disappear within like 10 minutes or whatever
<Sneas> 03or some 1337 h4x0r.
<Tiel> yeah.
<Altair> that guy was certainly not leet
<Tiel> I dunno.
<Tiel> it pisses me off.
<Tiel> a lot. xD
<Altair> first thing he did was issue a ton of help commands LOL
<Tiel> lawlwat XD
<Altair> He does /os help
<Altair> then /os mode and types something in wrong
<Tiel> hm. o.o
<Altair> But oh well, I happened to return in the act so yeah nothing too terrible happened
<Tiel> I just feel terrible about it :/
<Tiel> that it was all done in my name and <censored>

<Raccoon> then how large the ban masks could be made
<Corevette789> Aah
<Raccoon> then it turned into figure out the size of the banlist and propogation
<Raccoon> i learned that only the first 101 bans propogate between servers
<Raccoon> after that, a channel becomes desynchronized
<Raccoon> so, if you want to prevent someone on another server from banning you. fill the banlist with 101 bans first
<Raccoon> then their bans wont leave their local server
<Raccoon> sort of bugs that were fixed way back in Hybrid 5
<Raccoon> not sure what branch this codebase comes from
<Aristeo> That's a pretty good way to get banned off a network
<Raccoon> Aristeo: my plain honesty is; what i was doing could not harm a server. and i currently enjoy membership on 13 servers... getting banned off one isn't going to make me cry.
<Raccoon> but i can be helpful in identifying issues if left to my own devices.
<Raccoon> just checking the tires.
<Aristeo> Don't get me wrong, I appreciate you for wanting to help, but I don't want you exploiting bugs on here. Why can't you download and install a test server to try that on?
<Raccoon> that would take time away from actually finding bugs :p
<Raccoon> then it becomes work
<Corevette789> Try it on Freenode...I dont liek them
<Aristeo> xD
<Raccoon> they're pretty matured right now
<Raccoon> and they switched to a different codebase that appears quite stable
<Aristeo> Or ChatSpike xD
*Aristeo considers ChatSpike to be a test network
<Raccoon> so how many other users have crashed ChanServ?
<Corevette789> But you wouldent let #UESPWiki come over here
<Corevette789> Would you?
<Corevette789> Raccoon I havent seen any here
<Aristeo> Corevette789: Sure, if they want to
<Stitch> Corevette789, YOU SAID THE U WORD!
<Corevette789> ?
<Raccoon> <+LaptopAristeo> We must never use the U-word in here :x
<Corevette789> I would like all my channels on this server
<Aristeo> Raccoon: But you'll actually get something done if you test bugs out on the ChatSpike servers :3
<Corevette789> Right
<Corevette789> Lol
*Stitch just found out he knows an InspIRCd developer. :o
<Raccoon> Stitch: what network is he on?
<Stitch> I met Brain on ECNet. :o
<Raccoon> Dr. Brain?
<Stitch> Raccoon, ChatSpike.
<Corevette789> Stitch...NO
<Stitch> I KNOW but sacrificed must be made.
<Stitch> sacrifices*
<DarkTruth> >_>
<Raccoon> who is Brain
<Raccoon> i know a coder by that name
<DarkTruth> only one I know is the CS one :X
<Raccoon> codes for CS?
<Corevette789> ChatSpike
<Raccoon> doh
<Raccoon> irc.chatspike.net took me to stitch.chatspike.net
<Corevette789> Yep
<Stitch> XD
<Corevette789> Thats a server name no relation
<Stitch> Not my server.
<Aristeo> \o/
<Aristeo> Yay, Raccoon will get to have fun, and have a nice testing server that no one cares about \o/
<Aristeo> Everyone's happy :D
*Aristeo does not like that network :x
<Aristeo> And Stitch doesn't either
<Raccoon> Stitch: do me a favor and don't tell anyone about my obnoxious endevors
<DarkTruth> yea we know Ari xD
<Stitch> XD
<Aristeo> http://www.aristeo.info/2010/06/01/why-chatspike-should-be-boycotted/
<Stitch> I haven't.
<sally> lol oh gawrsh
<Raccoon> Aristeo
<Raccoon> would they mind much if i took their ChanServ away?
<Stitch> Raccoon, if you do try it on CS, do tell me how it goes.
<Raccoon> i have to thank Corevette789 for giving me the idea of crashing chanserv
<Aristeo> Raccoon: They'd be mildly inconvenienced, probably, if they noticed
<Corevette789> Raccoon I'm on there now
<Corevette789> I really wanna see you do it
<Aristeo> xD
<Raccoon> #xyzzy
<Corevette789> Lol he's doing it
<Corevette789> Ari, jon the fun
<sally> :O
<Corevette789> I'm gonna proxy in
*Corevette789 can do that
<Aristeo> Oh deal
<Aristeo> dear*
<Aristeo> Don't associate this network with it, please
<Aristeo> >.>
<Corevette789> I'm not going to
<Corevette789> Raccoon, you too
*Stitch too.
<Stitch> ..
<Stitch> Which means I should probably pick a different alias.
<Aristeo> But yeah, that's how to grayhat :3
<Proto> lol
<Aristeo> You gotta go for the flagship network, no one cares about Epic Chat, we're nobody
<Aristeo> :P
<Raccoon> it's OK if it's someone else's network :>
<Aristeo> Well, no
<Corevette789> Exactly
<Aristeo> But it's okay if it's CS
<Raccoon> how many of you are using mIRC?
<Raccoon> you can help
<Corevette789> Or Freenode
<Corevette789> I am
*Stitch isn't.
<Stitch> But I can program a C++ bot if need me.
<Stitch> be*
<Corevette789> HA
*Corevette789 watches

<Raccoon> return $regsubex($str(a,$$1),/a/g,$mid(%x,$r(1,121),1))
<Raccoon> }
<Raccoon> then, when you are ready to begin, i'll op you in the chan
<Raccoon> you would type this command on ChatSpike
<Raccoon> /timer 0 1 mode #xyzzy +bb $rstr(250) $rstr(250)
<Curly> ... are you still flooding bans?
<Corevette789> To ChatSpike

<Aristeo> I can't stop you from doing whatever you want to do on ChatSpike, but I would prefer if you used a channel off the network to coordinate it
*Aristeo feels reaaaaaaaally uncomfortable about having coordination discussion on here
<Aristeo> Also!
<SuperiorLeafeon> I'd try out that script, but I always failed at it
*Aristeo has a funny picture he found on Facebook

<Prince-dari> Lol, I have Chrome OS, Ubuntu, and Windows 7 running. :o
<Neon> Dari: What's your stance on Amoeba?
<InfamousZed> apperently there was a post about beating someone to death with a book instead of selling it back to teh textbook buyback thing, and amazon removed it cause the title felt threatening, so they started another thread naming it is it alright to nudge them into death valley with it
<Prince-dari> You can't taste them.
<Prince-dari> So they suck.
<Neon> Nah, the OS. xD
<theguesst> Maybe I'll wake up to one in the morning

<Icydragon> 1...
<Icydragon> FUCK!
<drf|work> LOL @ timing
<drf|work> we're talking about London in another channel
<nintendofreak> everything in eternal night is cheap lol
<Nick> how crappy it is?
<nintendofreak> my least favorite wii game
<Articuno> 12Well that part isn't bad
<Articuno> 12It's central London, near trafalgar sq
<drf|work> I was there
<Icydragon> nintendofreak: I know, the just recolored everything, and called it a new game.
<Nick> well actually I tell a lie I went there on a college trip and it was actually a great city entertainment and culture/history wise
<drf|work> Trafalgar Square... is that the place with the big billboards?
<Icydragon> It was like a dlc...
<drf|work> for like JVC and stuff?
<Icydragon> If you will...
<Nick> hamleys was brilliant! :)
<Articuno> 12No thats picadilly
<nintendofreak> played dotd 1st then eternal night then i played anb and went wtf lazy developers on eternal night
<drf|work> oh
<drf|work> what's in Trafalgar?
<drf|work> I swear the name is familiar
<nintendofreak> only thing new those dogs ....
<Articuno> 12A square with fountains and peadge
<Articuno> 12s
<drf|work> ...
<drf|work> any shops or anything?
<drf|work> also :D
<Articuno> 12No
<Nick> which they scared them all away from :\
<drf|work> I'm celebrating
<drf|work> #PM is officially dead
<drf|work> :D
<Nick> also yeah theres a tokyotoys thing in picadilly
<Articuno> 12why?
<Articuno> 12Why's it dead?
<Articuno> 12Not that I care but Im just curious
<drf|work> apparently they got mad about someone torrenting their encodes
<drf|work> and got p*ssy about copyrights
<Nick> my tutor said they used hawks or something
<drf|work> so they decided to just shut it down
<Icydragon> In the ds version, there were saber-toothed like tiger thingys...
<drf|work> they password protected the channel and shut off all their bots
<Nick> oh wait thought you meant about me
<drf|work> they've been kinda messed up for the past while anyway, like they wouldn't let you download their stuff unless you're serving files yourself
<Icydragon> I think the gba version was the most original one, and most fun...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate the dogs
<nintendofreak> i just freeze em and melee them
<Icydragon> Wait... why do I have so many eternal nights?
<Articuno> 12LOL NIck
<Icydragon> Is that the script?
<nintendofreak> glutton for punishment

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *rolls eyes
<Neon> KJ, hey hey.

<Nick> what?
<Kjakings> 7cool
<Articuno> 12That you thought I was asking you LOL
<Neon> I'm kidding...
*Nick throws wood pigeons at Arti
<Kjakings> 7I stopped caring when people showed me their 'works of art' a long time ago and just defaulted to 'cool'
<Neon> It's not even mine, it was a joke.
<Kjakings> 7^see above^
<Neon> Well, perhaps you'll find this one a bit more accurate: http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/troll.gif?t=1280951881
<Kjakings> 7am I the only one who doesn't know who that Cyndi person is?
<Icydragon> CYNDI!
<Neon> I didn't until today. Assumed you were familiar...
<Icydragon> Kjakings: Consider yourself lucky.
<Nick> oh btw you have your pics vids of teh airshow?
<Kjakings> 7there are far too many idiotic children associated with Spyro
<Cyndi> 10hello
<Kjakings> 7Icy, don't
<Neon> Cyndi: http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/troll.gif?t=1280951881
<Neon> Hi.
<Cyndi> 10........

<Kjakings> 7FAR more intelligent than you
<Cyndi> 10ehh

<Cyndi> 10cuz im having some bacon.
<Neon> Are we bovvering you?
<Cyndi> 10oh yeas
<Cyndi> 10so anyone here want some bacon?
<Kjakings> 7oh good god it's like a real version of Catherine Tate
<Cyndi> 10.......
<Neon> Define 'real.'
<Cyndi> 10lolwhut
<Kjakings> 7touchÃ©
<Cyndi> 10oh good insulting a person you've only met for like 5 seconds#
<Neon> Insulting strangers is the most sincere form.
<Nick> :(
<Icydragon> She'll be back.
<Kjakings> 7indeed. If you insult a stranger your insults ring truer as they're not tainted by previous experience
<Neon> Bingo.
<Neon> Although ironically people take it less personal if the insult comes from a stranger, yet it's probably the most accurate.
<Kja> 7god I hate mibbit
<Neon> 16:05 Neon Although ironically people take it less personal if the insult comes from a stranger, yet it's probably the most accurate.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ugh i ded
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *died
<Icydragon> What killed you?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> those little apes
<Kja> 7abject stupidity?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they swarmed me
<nintendofreak> spam em with electric orbs
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm gonna darkspyro their butts
<Neon> Voltorbs will not help you here.
<nintendofreak> then melee em back and forth
<Kja> 7Neon: have you read PokÃ©Wars
<Neon> No, is it a comic?
<Kja> 7?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i darkspyroed their butts
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> haha
<Kja> 7no, an FF. But at the very peak of FFs. The basic premise is "uuuh, what would happen if PokÃ©mon became lethal? that would be AWESOME."
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> apes suck
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> this is why humans are superio
<Kja> 7but it kicks all six kinds of ass
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *superior
<Kja> 7humans are superior because, theoretically *cough*, we're more intelligent and sapient
<Neon> Kja: Hahaha, sounds cool.
<Kja> 7I can go grab you a link
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yeah and apes aren't
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> hence them getting beaten by spyro
<Kja> 7it's currently in the third book
<Neon> Kja: Also, we have the ability to form a social unit that no animal (of for some, "other animal" could create.
<Neon> *or for some
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate apes
<Neon> Sure, give me that link.
<Kja> 7It annoys me when people refer to sapience as sentience
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol sparx
<Kja> 7ooh yay. one sec
<Kjakings> 7there we go
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> sparx is so weird
<Neon> Curses, I have to get off for a short while.
<Kjakings> 7ok
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yay gaul
<Kjakings> 7I'll go grab the link quicksies
<Neon> I'll get the link after.
<Neon> Okay, or now.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm on the gaul boss fight
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i wish he didn't take away spyro's mana
<Icydragon> I never understood why they did that.
<nintendofreak> another way to po the gamer
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i also don't get why gaul hates spyro
<Kjakings> 7eh. he's gone already
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and why he kidnapped cynde
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *cynder
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> if he hates dragons
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> why'd he take one
<Kjakings> 7he doesn't hate dragons. he works for Malefor.
<nintendofreak> needed 1 to free malefor
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: Maybe he wanted to corrupte her again..
<nintendofreak> well kidnap definitely lured spyro there
<Icydragon> Kjakings: As the hermit said, it was out of there own greed...
<Icydragon> You don't have to like someone to work for them.
<Kjakings> 7one thing that annoyed me about ANS: Cynder SUCCEEDED. why was Malefor not released there and then? all four crystals were put into convexity, yet for some reason he wasn't released like he was supposed to be
<Kjakings> 7and why did Convexity start randomly collapsing like that?
<Icydragon> Kjakings: I think it was just his spirit released or some shit like that.
<Kjakings> 7at the end of TEN, wasn't his body formed of coalescing smoke?
<Kjakings> 7why not just go find some camping cheetahs
<Icydragon> Who knows, TLoS has alot of plot holes.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> amen
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> so confusing
<nintendofreak> .... why i never really pay attention to stories in vide games
<Kjakings> 7fucking internet
*Andres throws his shirt at the crowd.
<Andres> I mean, hi D:
<Sneas> R
<Icydragon> What a surprise...
<Kjakings> 7seriously. why will nobody explain to me who she is?
<Kjakings> 7oh god. is she Hail?
<Cyndi> 10....
<Cyndi> 10NO
<Cyndi> 10IM ME
<Cyndi> 10GOD
<Icydragon> Kjakings: She's a new user.
<Cyndi> 10EXACTLY
<Cyndi> 10THANK YOU
<Kjakings> 7she reminds me much of Hail
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> hey does anyone know what will happen if u don't use fury at the end of the gaul fight?
<nintendofreak> die
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> like if u don't press R2?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh what does he do?
<Cyndi> 10*hugs icy for explaining something so damn obvious*
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> gaul
<nintendofreak> lazy knocks you to your death
<nintendofreak> lazer*
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: I think so.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh rly?
<Cyndi> 10yeah it does
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> wow
<nintendofreak> yah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that goodness i press fury
<Cyndi> 10Gaul is just feh to me
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i know what happens if u don't use ur fury on cynder
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she uses hers
<Cyndi> 10never use darkspyro on gaul
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> wait his first form?
<Cyndi> 10yes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> why?
<Cyndi> 10because
<nintendofreak> half damage done to him
<Cyndi> 10gual has pretty much dark power
<Cyndi> 10powers*
<Cyndi> 10so yeah 50% taken off
<Icydragon> You can't use it on the first battle.
<Cyndi> 10but
<Cyndi> 10you can use it on the second
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i know someone who on the 2nd part of the gaul fight, they used all melee moves
<Cyndi> 10so you can whoop his ass
<nintendofreak> dark spyro not good against some creatures as well liek the tree guys int he 2nd level
<Cyndi> 10yeah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they didn't use convexity
<Cyndi> 10wait why?
<Cyndi> 10they have poison i thinl
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they just used dark spyro's combat move
<Cyndi> 10think*
<Kjakings> 7what's with the fury powers in DoTD? seriously, they just completely ignored previous fury powers and made them into giant purple lasers
<Cyndi> 10ah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> amen
<nintendofreak> did less damage compared to other elements
<Cyndi> 10WHOO
<Cyndi> 10LAZERS
<Cyndi> 10but yeah
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i would of liked to see spyro corrupted
<Cyndi> 10Kja is so right thare
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> like cynder was
<Cyndi> 10i would have liked to see a poison fury
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> like see what happens if gaul takes his egg
<Floofbreon> 10!espeon !sneas !arcanine
*lolwork now belongs to Floofbreon for 10 minutes
*Espeon now belongs to Floofbreon for 15 minutes
*Arcanine now belongs to Floofbreon for 12 minutes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> not cynder's
<Cyndi> 10stupid DOTD makers
<Icydragon> Kjakings: Yeah, and why does cynder have a purple breath?
<Cyndi> 10i know right
<nintendofreak> too lazy to change it.....
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i wanna see dark spyro stay dark spyro
<Cyndi> 10its just god modding
<Kjakings> 7no, it's power playing. learn your words.
<Cyndi> 10ehh
<Cyndi> 10whatever floats your boat
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate that cynder pushed spyro out of the beam
<Kjakings> 7actually, no it's not. it's just stupid
<Cyndi> 10hmmm
<Cyndi> 10probably
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i guess she knew he was corrupted
<Cyndi> 10and why does cynder have four elements?
<Cyndi> 10i mean they say
<Cyndi> 10it was the dark ''gifts''
<Cyndi> 10but she only used fire in ANB
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> how come we don't see cynder in TEN?
<Cyndi> 10so like WTF
<nintendofreak> there for like a few scenes.....
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol Jim Carrey in the credits
<Cyndi> 10haha lol
<Kjakings> 7well, considering they made her eleventy times bigger than she should be there was some serious genetic fucking around up in there, so I would assume other things were affected
<Cyndi> 10oh okay
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> my friend's name is in the credits for ANB
<Kjakings> 7considering she was a wind dragon but she could use fire in ANS
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> Daniel Cox
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Cyndi> 10hmm that could be the fact
<Kjakings> 7not ANS. why do I keep calling it that?
<Cyndi> 10but still
<Cyndi> 10lol
<Cyndi> 10XD
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> was Exhumor in TEN?
<Cyndi> 10no
<nintendofreak> no
<Kjakings> 7Justin: no it's not. shut up and stop attention seeking
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they show corey burton
<Cyndi> 10yus
<Cyndi> 10Cynder shouldnt have convexity breath
<Cyndi> 10like where the hell did she get it?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> why not?
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: He played Cyril.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh ok
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> no that was jeff bennett
<Kjakings> 7convexity breath?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> corey burton played volteer
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that's so funny my friend's name is in the credits for ANB
<Kjakings> 7Justin: no it's not. shut up and stop attention seeking
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> u shut up
<Icydragon> I get the voice actors confused, besides, they have such short roles.
<Espeon> greedyfloof

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i wish they had the furies they had in ANB and TEN
<Kjakings> 7every time I see that I keep thinking people are saying furries. although both would be applicable
<Icydragon> Kjakings: Lol me too.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i thought Cynder breaths convexity
<Espeon> lol
<Kjakings> 7convexity is a place, not a substance
<Kjakings> 7you can't breath French
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i meant the breath
<Kjakings> 7right. what exactly is 'convexity' breath anyway>
<Kjakings> 7when does she use it?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> at the end of ANB
<Kjakings> 7you mean the fire she uses?
<Kjakings> 7which is clearly fire
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: I think thats fire.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh
<Kjakings> 7an odd shade of red for fire, but still
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> alot of ppl think spyro should of encased him and sparx in the crystal
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and let cynder to die
<Kjakings> 7that's because people get oddly vehement about games
<Kjakings> 7they would make bad religious leaders
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> well spyro breathes convexity
<Kjakings> 7... when?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> at the end of TEN
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and ANB
<Kjakings> 7that's dark spyro at the end of TEN
<Kjakings> 7and ANB it's inexplicable purple dragon powers
<Kjakings> 7not convexity.
<Kjakings> 7convexity is a place.
<Kjakings> 7not a substance
<RedDragonX> lol
<Kjakings> 7you don't breathe Spanish
<Icydragon> Kjakings: For some reason, they called his dark breath, convexity breath...
<Kjakings> 7the inexplicable purple dragon powers are impressions of his face anyway. what sort of sense does that make?
<Kjakings> 7it's clearly a corrupted dark poer
<RedDragonX> The only time I've seen anything refered to as Convexity breath is the ray that Spyro can use in his Dark Spyro from that is unlocked at the end of TEN when you complete some challenges
<Kjakings> 7power*
<Kjakings> 7how would it even begin to be Convexity? that's just where they sent Malefor to rot
<Icydragon> RedDragonX: I don't know, it's just a freaking game anyway, I'd accept it if it were called whatever.
<TimeShift> evening together. Finally home...
<Kjakings> 7a handy seperate dimension that they could easily access at the time
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i like dark spyro
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> he whoops butt
<Kjakings> 7that's the idea
<Kjakings> 7power over morality
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i use him on the dragon challenges
*Betowolf sighs
<Betowolf> I wonder if kipi's still around
<Kjakings> 7isn't that cheating a little bit? like bringing a warhammer to a knife-fight
<Icydragon> I forgot all abot the dragon challenges.
<Soyuz> kipi hasnt been on in a long time actually..
<Betowolf> he's been unhappy with me
<TimeShift> my cat's sitting on me again ;_;
<Soyuz> Betowolf; why?
<Icydragon> Oh joy!
<drf|work> and you guys actually LIKE cats
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
*drf|work runs
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> what?
<Neon> :P
<Neon> Oh, happy day...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> what?
<Betowolf> because he's angry that I keep ignoring him on IRC or messing up roleplays
<Neon> what?
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: Forget about it.
<Soyuz> o3o
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ok
<Betowolf> I dont use IRC often here I know -_-;
<Betowolf> I not only have ADD but I have high functioning autism
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> anyone beaten the dragon challenges?
<nintendofreak> once long time ago
<Icydragon> Yeah,only once.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the hardest one is the 1st one
<Soyuz> and he doesnt know this?
<Neon> "My dad tried to hang me by my shirt up on a door once... once."
<Betowolf> nope
<Kjakings> 7http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4480577/1/Poke_Wars_The_Subsistence
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the 4th one is good
<Neon> Thanks, dude.
<Betowolf> I should have told him before hand so that he wouldn't give me a hard time.
<Kjakings> 7it may take a couple days to read
<Soyuz> But I havent seem him on the chat in weeks
<Soyuz> or longer
<Soyuz> ever since the voice thing
<Kjakings> 7anyway, the reason I originally brought it up was because I'm gunna be helping the dude with a future arc-book-thingy on it
<Neon> Kjakings: I love how Morty has Ghost Pokemon.
<Neon> That's so clever.
<Neon> Oh, I see. Epic.
<Betowolf> but I dunno. I guess you can ask him. but he'll probably be growling at me for telling people here on IRC.
<drf|work> voice..thing?
<Kjakings> 7I know
<Soyuz> drf; yes
<Soyuz> but I'm FAR to lazy to tell you
<Soyuz> Betowolf; when and if he gets back on
<Neon> Um, is this guy aware that Entei, Suicune and Raiku are the legendary cats?
<nintendofreak> weren't they dogs...
<Kjakings> 7they're dogs
<Neon> No, they're called cats.
<Kjakings> 7they're the legendary dogs
<Neon> Lies! xD
<Kjakings> 7you're the first person I've met who calls them cats
<nintendofreak> >.> dogs
<Kjakings> 7I understand both are applicable
<Kjakings> 7it's just that dogs is more common
<Neon> Fair enough.
<Kjakings> 7he's now doing an arc that focuses entirely on the legendaries.
<Kjakings> 7Lugia is leading a revolution against him
<Neon> Sounds good.
<Neon> I'm curious if he uses spellcheck... ever.
<Kjakings> 7he gets much better at writing later on
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> this sucks
<Kjakings> 7this one was made two years ago
*Neon nods.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> does anyone ever have one of those "blahh" days
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ?
<drf|work> bbl going home
<Neon> I laughed though when it said: "Do not lie to me, Suicine!" HoOh barked.
<Neon> *Ho-oh
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> nvm
<Kjakings> 7he's been writing them practically non-stop for nearly two years
<Kjakings> 7he gets far better
<Neon> I don't doubt that, it's just funny to make fun of.
<PTS> anyone here rom hack
<Neon> Enjoyable story nonetheless.
<Kjakings> 7he's gunna re-write the first one eventually
<Kjakings> 7anyway
<Kjakings> 7they kick ass
<Neon> Hm, Ash is in it, eh?
<Kjakings> 7yeah. he's one of the main characters
<Kjakings> 7one of ash, one of may, the current legendary one
<Neon> Cool.
<Kjakings> 7and next either a second johto (the one with may) or a sinnoh arc
<Kjakings> 7I'mma help him with a future Ranger arc
<Neon> Is it sometimes collab FF then?
<Drake> 04morning
<Kjakings> 7no, but he does get help with certain parts when he gets stuck
<Kjakings> 7lots in the legendary arc
<Neon> Ah.
<Neon> Do you write there often?
<Neon> FF.net I mean.
<Kjakings> 7no
<Kjakings> 7it's just I review his a lot so he trusts me and I sent a message about an arc and he said it was a good idea and asked if I would help
*Neon exhales in relief.
<Kjakings> 7thanks ^^
<Neon> :P
<Neon> Why have you adopted girlish faces?
<Kjakings> 7it is not girlish
<Kjakings> 7it is only girlish if you put that stupid . in the middle
<Neon> No, no, I assure you it's still girlish.
<Kjakings> 7it is not.
<Neon> :P
<Neon> ^.^ Silly KJ.

<Feather> Sheena
<SheenaFox> I saw a feather at that park today
<Kjakings> 7paradise
<Kjakings> 7it has to be said, it's a good game where people ENJOY crashing at times
<Feather> :OOOO
<SheenaFox> Aero said Lucas after I said feather XD
<Feather> LOL
<Kjakings> 7we got the ultimate collection so we got the Back to the Future and the Nightrider cars
<Stitch> LaptopAristeo, * fateclaw has quit (Quit: Let me take you a button-hole lower. -- William Shakespeare, LoveÂ´s LabourÂ´s Lost)
<Feather> LUCAAAAAAAS~
<Neon> Hahaha, my friend was telling me about those.
<Soyuz> DEFEH, CLEAN YOUR SHOES
<Neon> He was obsessed with it until Forza III debuted.
<Drake> 04hey Tiel

<Tiel> I'm playing EverQuest 2~
<Drake> 04anyway brb
<Stitch> ,-o-,
<Kjakings> 7they do kick all ass
<Feather> Hi Lyon
<Kjakings> 7although I actually prefer the road mode of the back to the future car instead of hover mode
<Kjakings> 7although hover is good when boosting
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Do you have it for PC?
<Tiel> sneas :D!
<Sneas> 03ih
<Kjakings> 7yeah
<ChaosLord> !sneas
*Sneas now belongs to ChaosLord for 7 minutes
*Andres cuddles a pole.
<Chimera> :c
<Kjakings> 7I found something funny. On one car no matter what you do to it the windows in it will never break
<Kjakings> 7I hit another car and slammed roof-first into a suspension bridge
<Neon> Now is that a glitch or an intended aspect of the car?
<Neon> That's funny though.
<Sneas> 03looking at old yearbooks is wierd :3
<Cyndi> 10......................
<Cyndi> 10hey ranodms
<Neon> Hi, PMS.
<ChaosLord> because you look so OLD
<Cyndi> 10.......................
<Kjakings> 7I dunno, probably a glitch
<Cyndi> 10so what have we established now?
<Kjakings> 7I've been trying to reach Terminal Velocity with the Back to the Future car
<Neon> Well, I think you're the one who established it, Cyndi.
<Neon> You yelled about it earlier.
<Cyndi> 10established whut?
<Cyndi> 10nvm
<Kjakings> 7it's not that easy, considering the bastard doesn't like to turn when in hover mode
<Cyndi> 10WTF? XD
<Cyndi> 10china town yay
<Neon> Kjakings: Are the motor controls better when you don't use hover?
<Neon> Cyndi: I'm not really allowed per se to go into the origin of your name.
<Cyndi> 10whut
<Kjakings> 7yeah, but it's slower. and for Terminal Velocity I need speed
<Neon> Ah. That's cool that they put that in there for the individual car.
<Kjakings> 7you have to pay for the user of it
<Sneas> 03lol
<Sneas> 03XD
<Kjakings> 7so it should have awesome things
<Cyndi> 10okay i have no idea whats going on here
<Kjakings> 7if you're not going to ask what Terminal Velocity is I'm going to tell you
<Cyndi> 10......
<Cyndi> 10well?
<Neon> KJ: Is it when you go so fast you die? xD
<Kjakings> 7when driving into oncoming traffic in a stunt car it delivers small packages of boost every 200 yards. the faster you go, the quicker they're delivered. so I'm trying to find the boosting speed where it's delivered so quickly it matches the use of the boost so you have infinite boost
<Cyndi> 10okay.....
<Neon> That's freakin' amazing.
<Cyndi> 10*posh voice* my toilet is so fancy its filled with bottled water!
<Kjakings> 7also, busses are instant death in this and they barely get damaged, no matter what the speed, so I'm trying to kill a bus too
<Kjakings> 7I hit Terminal Velocity once on the highway but I can't do it again
<Kjakings> 7the problem with driving that fast into oncoming traffic is you have very little time to react to oncoming cars
<Neon> Well, it seems like t'is it a difficult thing to recreate.
<Neon> *it's a difficult
<Kjakings> 7it is
<Kjakings> 7it's easier with a speed car because they go faster, but their boost is different so it doesn't count
<Andres> Salllly! :o
<Andres> Hai!
<Neon> Argh.
<Sally> Hi :o
<Kjakings> 7and there's this one kickass spin ramp on the highway, and since the back to the future car leaves twin trails of fire when it boosts, so I wanna hit that boosting and leave fire spirals
*Sally is on iPod.
<Sally> I dt likie
<Andres> :o
<ChaosLord> asteroid~
*Sally pokes Andres
<Xeeshu> g2g guyz..

<Sneas> 03I like playing one of the not too popular games that's nerdy and stuff on mine :3
<Skylands> 10What game is that?
<Sneas> 03Simearth
<Sneas> 03XD
*Skylands wikis it
<Sneas> 03It's slow but passes the time good :3
<Skylands> 10"the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc, then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve."
<Skylands> 10at first I thought it sounded boring, until I see game screenshots o-o

<Kjakings> 7and trying to create brand new empires from scratch to fight them with me is annoying because they just start fighting each other
<Kjakings> 7completely ignoring the fact that they live in the heart of the biggest evil in the galaxy
<Espeon> lol Pokemon creepypasta
<Neon> Are all of these empires real people?
<Aristeo> I'm going to go wash my mom's car for her, I'll brb
*Andres huggles the Sally so she would not freeze!
<Kjakings> 7no
<Kjakings> 7NPCs
<Drake> 04back
<Kjakings> 7I don't think you can interact with real people in that way
<Kjakings> 7it would kick all ass
<Kjakings> 7have you heard of Darkspore?
<Neon> No, I'm not too familiar.
<Kjakings> 7it's basically an action RPG but with the spore creature creator engine. you get DNA to use as weapons to fight off the bad guys
<Kjakings> 7I really hope there'll be space combay
<Kjakings> 7combat
<Neon> Oh, it hasn't yet been released?
<Kjakings> 7no
<RedDragonX> lol
<Kjakings> 7just been announced
<Kjakings> 7we've only had one trailer and a completely useless pre-release website, designed only to house the trailer as if youtube doesn't exist
<Neon> That's hilarious that they still do that for advertisement.
<Kjakings> 7there'll probably more stuff on there later, but that's why I frequent The Escapist
<Kjakings> 7and on that note, Pokemon Black and White will have no Pokemon that aren't introduced in that series
<Neon> Haha, I love The Escapist.
<Neon> Zero Punctuation is a riot.
<Neon> Kjakings: Wait, so no fifth gen?
<Neon> *only
<Kjakings> 7yep. they appear once you beat the elite four, but before that only the fifth gen
<Kjakings> 7which are you gunna get?
<Kjakings> 7if you do get them
<Kjakings> 7I am because I'm a sucker, but still
<Sneas> 03Back :3
<Neon> I'll have to purchase another DS first, but I'll most likely get Black.
<Neon> I'm genuinely interested in these games.
<Kjakings> 7I'm getting white because I hate the Black legendary. he looks like a robot chicken
<Skylands> 10wbs
<Kjakings> 7the idea behind it is that everybody is on the same line, so that veterans don't gain an instant i pwn u all wiv my mad skilzz advantage over newblets
<Kjakings> 7I'm may get both because of the different locations thing
<Neon> You'd choose one over the other just because of the legendary?
<Drake> 04wb
<Kjakings> 7yeah
<Kjakings> 7plus, White Forest sounds awesomer than Black City. whenever 'forest' comes into it, I invariably go to Celebi. who is the awesomest legendary
<Kjakings> 7because let's face it, you fuck with celebi and she'll go back in time and cockblock your dad from getting with your mum, and you never existed
<Sneas> 03:3 3:

<Kjakings> 7if your wireless thing is just sitting outside your house I hope it doesn't rain
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate her
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she kicked me out of the house till i shower
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> and she won't let me in to eat dinner
<Kjakings> 7she does realise the shower is inside?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> or nothing
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> no cause she's retarded
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> point is i can't go in my OWN house
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> till i shower
<Aristeo> Back!
<Kjakings> 7isn't it really her house?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> ok fine but isn't she being a little f*ded up
<Kjakings> 7did you explain to her that the shower was inside?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yes
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she said idc
<Kjakings> 7was it in a calm and collected manner?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yes
<Kjakings> 7I don't believe you
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she told me to use a hose to shower
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm not lying
<Kjakings> 7do you own a hose?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yes
<Stitch> :o
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> she says she doesn't want me stinking up her furniture
<Kjakings> 7do you have a high fence?

<Kjakings> 7I watched Final Destination 3 when I was like 8, just before going to Alton Towers
<JLF> final destination 3 is good
<Neon> Final Destination isn't scary, though.
<Neon> It's more like a thriller.

*Aristeo highfives Stormy
<Kjakings> 7add that to actually going to a theme park two days afterwards
<Kjakings> 7that was a fun trip

<Neon> But, lol, that's funny.
<ChaosLord> DEFEH
<Aristeo> :D
<JLF> the only thing i hate in the Omen is how the kid wins
<Kjakings> 7what happened to Gordon?
<JLF> i wanted to shoot that kid
*Neon shrugs.
<Neon> They built it up pretty nicely.

<TimeShift> that's me
<Articuno> 12Again I am finding problems with files that I REALLY need to use right now.. and the guy still hasn't replied
<TimeShift> maybe he's on holiday...
<TimeShift> besides...through Facebook - grab a phonebook and try and call him ;)
<Articuno> 12No he replied this morning about the cloud but nothing else
<Articuno> 12All his info is hidden
<TimeShift> you got the city, right?
<TimeShift> just look at the phonebook for his name^^
<Jerry> 2ARRRTI! :D
<Jerry> 2Hai
<Jerry> 2And Hai Time Shift! :DD
*Jerry glomps both Articuno and TimeShift 'Long time no see!"

<Articuno> 12TimeShift, I don't have a phone book here :>
<Jerry> 2heya Timey
<Articuno> 12But yeh I might do that
<TimeShift> online?^^

<Jerry> 2heya Hawkie~
<TimeShift> you're filmed and recorded everywhere
<Hawkie> Hey
<Articuno> 12I wouldn't mind but they don't actually solve more crimes than money they spend!
<TimeShift> the only fun-thing: A band used cctv for their advantage
<Hawkie> Oh?
<TimeShift> they took their instruments and played in front of each of those cameras....and then asked for the tapes
<TimeShift> they had to hand the tapes out....and so they could produce the music video out of them
<Hawkie> O-o
<Articuno> 12LOL
<TimeShift> http://gadgetopia.com/post/6379
<TimeShift> Unable to hire a production crew for a standard 1980Â’s era MTV music video, they performed their music in front of 80 of the 13 million CCTV Â“securityÂ” cameras available in England, including one on a bus.
<TimeShift> They then used BritainÂ’s Data Protection Act to request the footage that was shot of them.
<Articuno> 12XDDDDD
<Articuno> 12One thing
<Articuno> 12Rubbish quality
<Articuno> 12So you're better off just shooting it with a home video cam.....
<Articuno> 12Dunno why they didn't do that.....!
<TimeShift> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqxYlvjIEw4
<TimeShift> their music video

<Neon> Icy: You are.
<Icydragon> NOT TRUE!
<InfamousZed> save it for aicebo
<Icydragon> D:
<Neon> You're right, it's not true.
<Quilava> I would have to redownload it, and I don't have the links any more
*Neon laughs.
<Quilava> all that's on my old comp :/
<Quilava> ..and my deck, for that matter
<Arcanine> 04same

<Arcanine> 04then i downloaded the scans for the 3 sets that were released when i sort of lost interest in playing
<Neon> Yes, sir.
<Quilava> :/
<InfamousZed> whats lambda and icy have to say on this evening?
<Lambda> Ramen
<Quilava> I would play if there was someone to play with... building a deck for the sole purpose of self-testing is just pointless
<InfamousZed> ah
<Tiel> oh god I remember downloaded all those card scans
<Icydragon> MEN!
<Lambda> it tastes good
<Lambda> ll
<Tiel> *downloading
<Lambda> *lol
<Icydragon> Men taste good?

<InfamousZed> ok..
<InfamousZed> get your ass and cube back
<Neon> No, a literal caboose.
<Neon> I want it back!
<InfamousZed> get your rear cart back then
<Arcanine> 04i'm thinking of playing again Quilava
<Arcanine> 04just for the heck of it
<Neon> If it was that simple I'd have it by now.
<Neon> She locked it away in Rapunzel's tower.
*InfamousZed flips to annother channel to see what else is on tv
<Lambda> Nothing is on TV
<Lambda> I just checked
<InfamousZed> ya got to turn it on first bud
<InfamousZed> right now my tv is off :P
<Neon> I don't watch TV anymore. Well, that's a lie, I do on Netflix.
<InfamousZed> i'm sorta curious about netflix
<InfamousZed> how much do you pay?
<Neon> I have instant. Nine dollars a month, and I get a crapload of movies and TV instantly.
<InfamousZed> streamed or delivered by mail or what
<Quilava> its fun, but nobody else is into it
<Neon> Streamed.
<InfamousZed> ah
<Neon> If I want something that's not available on Instant, they'll mail it to me.
<Keegan> Hi ya
<drf|laptop> 03hi

<Keegan> 12maily "edward" and "bella"
<Creideiki> The characters are better... because anything has better characterization than Twi-fail.
<Glacymr> 12you missed Vinyer's entrance Sparky D:
<Glacymr> 12also we missed you, wb
<Sparky> 2I did
<Sparky> 2not my fault
<Sparky> 2and I had my characters passed off
<Glacymr> 12i know
<Glacymr> 12aero didn't do that good though
<Creideiki> In fact... I've seen Monty Python routines that have more fleshed out characters than Twilight. :P

<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Keegan> 12I can't wait for this movie to come out

<Quilava> oh, ok.
<Quilava> well I'd still have to make a deck in that case though
<Arcanine> 04i don't make decks
<Arcanine> 04i just copy othe peoples decks XD
<Quilava> lol
<Quilava> you should try making one
<Quilava> also I just brushed my teeth and drank some juice.... It tasted like medicine <.<;
<Arcanine> 04that's why i always wait until i drink something
<Arcanine> 04for some reason
<Arcanine> 04if i drink water it hurts
<Quilava> water is usually what I use to make the horrid taste go away
<Arcanine> 04its like it burns my cheeks
<Quilava> because toothpaste burns off the inner layer of your skin <.<
<Quilava> thats how it 'cleans'
<Quilava> then when you wash the residue off you can actually feel it
<Raccoon> download this -- rename to .rar -- http://i38.tinypic.com/ftn8ly.jpg
<LaptopAristeo> Uhhhhhh, no
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Arcanine> 04i have some really DEEP tooth stains
<Arcanine> 04i've been using that 3D White toothpaste for over 2 weeks and my teeth haven't gotten that much brighter
<Arcanine> 04it says it removes 80% of surface stains after 2 weeks so it must be deep
<Quilava> yeah.
<JLF> hey Icy
<Quilava> so uh, I currently don't have a deck
<Arcanine> 04what happened to the deck on your older computer?
<Quilava> ..its on my old computer
<Arcanine> 04you can't find the file and email it to yourself?
<Quilava> I could, but my sister has my old computer
<Arcanine> 04oh
<Arcanine> 04ohhh
<Shy> lalalallala being banned from freenode stinks lalallalallalala
<Icydragon> Hey!
<Arcanine> 04i think you had some sort of landfall deck
<Arcanine> 04that liked to mill cards
<Icydragon> Sorry, I was doing something, as always...
<Arcanine> 04don't worry i found a card you'll like Quilava :P
<Icydragon> Anyways how are you?
<Quilava> alt F4?
<Arcanine> 04http://www.mtgvault.com/images/cards/WWK/Jace_the_Mind_Sculptor.jpg
<JLF> good
<JLF> my bf and i broke up
<JLF> we're kinda blah right now
<Quilava> huh
<Arcanine> 04the -12 effect
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Icydragon> Oh....
<Quilava> you know
<Quilava> if there's a creature that gets bonuses from exiled cards in your discard...
<Quilava> using it on yourself might actually be a good idea
<JLF> yeah
<JLF> doesn't bother me
<Icydragon> Ok...
<Arcanine> 04the point is to target your opponent
<Quilava> I know
<Arcanine> 04and there you go
<Arcanine> 04you just exiled their entire deck XD
<Quilava> but you don't HAVE to
<Icydragon> Well' I've been alright myself.
<Arcanine> 04i don't know if there are any cards
<Quilava> it can be deterred by reliquary tower + drawing cards
<Arcanine> 04that get bonuses like that
<Arcanine> 04btw
<Arcanine> 04i found this other card
<Arcanine> 04it's a 6/6 creature with flying and trmple
<Arcanine> 04lol it's effect is the best effect ever
<Arcanine> 04You can't win the game, and your opponent can't lose the game.
<Quilava> lol?
<Arcanine> 04so basically the 2nd you play it down
<Arcanine> 04*second
<Arcanine> 04you can no longer win
<Arcanine> 04but your opponent can
<JLF> haha i beat skabb
<Arcanine> 04so you got to play it with that creature that say you can't lose and your opponent can't win
<JLF> with earth
<Icydragon> =D
<Arcanine> 04having them both out would sort of be ".... why are we playing again?"
<JLF> get this
<JLF> those medium size guys he unleashes
<JLF> they threw bombs
<JLF> and the bombs hit him
<JLF> as well as my flail
<Quilava> lol
<Icydragon> o.O
<Quilava> that reminds me of my brother's yugioh deck
<Icydragon> Weird...
<JLF> so it was like too much pain
<Quilava> where he ends the game with like 20k life, when you start the game with 8
<JLF> i also used my fury on him to help
<EpicStatsGuy> inb4 fail
<Arcanine> 04lol
<Quilava> anyway
<Quilava> my sis is gonna let me borrow her comp.. eventually ><
<JLF> hi armageddon
<Arcanine> 04ok
<Arcanine> 04hopefully you can find the file
<JLF> well glad ur doing good icy
<Quilava> shouldn't be hard to find
<Arcanine> 04yeah
<Arcanine> 04unless the file is no longer there
<Arcanine> 04for some reason most of my decks were missing
<Quilava> ..sucks
<Arcanine> 04well sort of
<Arcanine> 04it's hard to explain really
<Armageddon> 02people poofed D:
<Arcanine> 04magic workstation could find it but when i tried looking in the same folder i couldn't find the actual files
<SuperiorFlareon> hii NS ^^

<Icydragon> I haven't played spyro in a while >.<
<Arcanine> 04ok
<JLF> oh lol
<Arcanine> 04lol i bought this magic card earlier today
<Arcanine> 04basically it's a black card that says at the end of your turn
<Arcanine> 04you reveal the top card of your deck and your opponents lose life equal to the converted mana cost of that card
<JLF> hey do u know what the chronicler meant when he said "this power is accentuated by ur impulsive nature"
<Arcanine> 04i wonder if there is a card that costs 20 mana to summon
<Icydragon> I guess that electricity is impulsive...
<Icydragon> ?

<kirara> 04anyway Quilava
<InfamousZed> for a couple minutes
<kirara> 04the highest converted mana cost i could find besides that is 16
<JLF> i'm eating an Oreo and one of my mom's homemade chocolate chip cookies
<kirara> 04Draco
*SuperiorFlareon pokes Kirara
<Icydragon> Mmmm, homemade would be better but whatever.....
<Icydragon> BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTT.

*kirara pokes SuperiorFlareon back
<JLF> hey u know who Justin Long is right?
<InfamousZed> found out we are gona get back a manager that we hate
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> No!
<Icydragon> Yeah...
<Soyuz> did you post Armageddon?
<JLF> yeah hence my name
<JLF> JLF
<Armageddon> 02nope
<Armageddon> 02I'm going soon
<SuperiorFlareon> so you are a girl XD
<Armageddon> 02but I'll post when I get to my dad's place
<Shy> ><
<InfamousZed> is stormy still fighting midget managers over at her walmart?
<Lambda> XD
<Lambda> Well the midget is a supervisor
<Lambda> but ginger managers yes
<InfamousZed> ah
<Icydragon> Gingers, never trust them...
<kirara> 04Quilava
<InfamousZed> tell her to come to mine as they are all lazy and tall and she can push them over
<Lambda> exactly
<Shy> ..even if i found a proxy, i wouldnt be able to use my useraccount though... since they banned my cloak also
<Lambda> Haha
<kirara> 04funny enough it might be the most expensive mana cost card in the game
<Lambda> sounds like my Walmart too
<kirara> 04but it's a really bad card lol
<Quilava> the 1mil?
<kirara> 04no
<kirara> 04draco
<kirara> 04the highest converted mana cost card in the game that isn't from unglued or unhinged
<Icydragon> *JLFpoke*
<JLF> lol owie
<Corevette789> You wont need a proxy, rather restart your router
<InfamousZed> theres only a couple of the managers i like out of the bunch and 2 others i respect
<JLF> that hurt the Mac guy
<kirara> 04for 16 mana it's like a 9/9
<Corevette789> Thats a better idea
<InfamousZed> but enough of that
<kirara> 04and you have to pay 10 mana a turn to keep it in play
<InfamousZed> i got to go
<InfamousZed> adios
<Icydragon> Oh noes!
*Stormy returns from vacuuming

<Corevette789> For what IM
<Icydragon> Well, ok I played it for ten minutes at one of those demo things at walmart when the game came out xP
<LaptopAristeo> I feel sooooooo uncomfortable that I'm taking to my college president in one box, and a hot girl I met and am flirting with in another box

<Icydragon> Neon: I freaking love you.
<Neon> What was your reception of it?
<Lambda> I sort of liked it
<Lambda> not as good as I was expecting though
<Neon> It was definitely an abnormal form of comedy, but it had glints.

<JLF> he's like she ain't dead
<JLF> she's alive
<BILLY_MAYS> Uhh....

<Icydragon3D> Is gay marrige even legal in Florida? lol.
<JLF> ninja pillows with lasers
<Arcanine> 04-2*
<Arcanine> 04you search your library for any one card and put it to the top of your deck
<where> D:
<Icydragon3D> Pedo ninja still pwns.
<Arcanine> 04so you get baneful omen out, get Liliana Vess then use -2 to put gleemax to the top of the deck
<JLF> dude the bf died
<JLF> in the movie
<Neon> I'm not sure. If it isn't, it soon will be with Prep 8.
<LaptopAristeo> I'm asking her questions, like, "are there demands for total faith and complete trust?" and she says yes
<Icydragon3D> They killed justine?
<JLF> he winded up in the same position as his gf
<Neon> *Prop
<JLF> that's awesome
<Icydragon3D> Now they can make ghost love.

<JLF> lol
<JLF> good movie
<JLF> very odd though
<Quilava> whats gleemax?
<Lambda> crap I was loading the first one
<Lambda> and I can't understand a word of it

<Light_Lati> brb
<Light_Latias> brb
<Icydragon3D> I love you guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys!
<Arcanine> 04gleemax is an unhinged card

<where> Who is this girl?
<Arcanine> 04but who cares it's just funny

<Neon> BABY PRIEST
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Quilava> what does the other card do then? :|
<Neon> I expect it to become a meme soon.
<Lambda> it's a full second shorter too
<JLF> lol
<JLF> the bf suffered the same fate his gf did
<Arcanine> 04at the end of your turn
<JLF> being stuck between life and death
<Arcanine> 04you reveal the top card of your deck
<JLF> in a funeral home
<Lambda> hahaha
<Icydragon3D> I love irony....
*Lambda is soooo glad the "pants on the ground" meme was a fail
<Arcanine> 04each of your opponents take life damage equal to the converted mana cost of that card
<JLF> me too
<Lambda> it was so annoying
<JLF> ironic ain't it?
*LaptopAristeo is keeping her anonymous for now
<Quilava> ..oh
<Quilava> ow
<Lambda> also
<Arcanine> 04XD
<Quilava> cheap deck :(

<Lambda> I love saying "ya dun goofed" now
*Kitten is just confused..
<Lambda> irl

<Neon> Ha, really?
<Neon> Did you see the vid and all?
<Quilava> there's ways to survive :P

<Lambda> yep
<Lambda> well
<Lambda> just parts
<Arcanine> 04you are still a little under one million life in the red though lol
<Lambda> and I didn't see the original
<Lambda> Stormy told me the story though
<Icydragon3D> My dog is to damn big to be all over me D:
<Arcanine> 04then you use that arfifact to gain a million life
<Arcanine> 04BROKE
<Neon> The original vid was hysteriucal.
<Neon> I tried to tell it to you guys before.
<Neon> *hysterical
<Lambda> haha I just didn't listen did I?
<Lambda> :P
<JLF> lol
<JLF> hey does anyone use redbox?
<Quilava> ..lol
<Icydragon3D> I do...
<JLF> do u know if u can keep a movie u rent?
<JLF> like u don't return it
<Arcanine> 04hmm i should look into that
<JLF> do they let u keep it?
<Neon> Meh, no worries.
<Arcanine> 04to see if it's possible to have -negative life
<Neon> I use it.
<Neon> But Netflix pwns it.
<JLF> oh
<Neon> Especially in bed.
<Lambda> "Earth sucks; Our stomach; I can't do it!"
<Lambda> XDDDD
<Lambda> preaching baby is awesome
<Icydragon3D> After a while, they just lake money away, and it counts as a slae.
<Icydragon3D> *sale
<JLF> so they let u keep it?
<Lambda> "I'm just a little- I'm- DURR"
<Lambda> XD
<Arcanine> 04hmm
<Neon> "I'm strong! I forgot our song!"
<Arcanine> 04Quilava i wonder if there is a card
<Lambda> XD yeah
<Arcanine> 04that lets you take one of your creatures and put it under your opponent's control
<Icydragon3D> You pay extra for a movie I think they'd prefer you to keep it.
<Lambda> I am laughing so hard
<Icydragon3D> >.>
<Lambda> this video is awesome
<Creideiki> Normal vaccinations aren't that bad. The most annoying vaccination ever has to be the smallpox vaccine. I felt like blagrh for a week.
<Arcanine> 04so pretty much you give them a creature
<Creideiki> And it's not even required any more!
<JLF> so wait they let u keep it if u don't return it?
<Neon> My dad sent it to me.
<Quilava> probably
<Neon> And since then I've been spreading it.
<Tiel> Mine was tetanus
<Tiel> xD
<JLF> like i rented After Life from redbox
<Neon> I hope it goes viral.
<JLF> but i wanna keep it
<Tiel> Whole arm felt sore for a week
<Arcanine> 04i would probably play that with that one creature
<theguesst> OMG sme
<theguesst> same*
<Arcanine> 04that says you can't win and your opponent can't lose
<Tiel> I couldn't move it e-e;
<theguesst> same shot exactly
<Icydragon3D> Is it a new movie?
<JLF> yes
<Arcanine> 04just be like "i'm going to summon this and give it to you"
<theguesst> and same feeling
<Creideiki> (You know... 'cause smallpox has been essentially killed off... except for reasearch labs in the US and Russia.)
<Quilava> lol
<JLF> it came out on dvd last week
<Quilava> sounds like a decent strategy
<JLF> it came out on august 3rd
<theguesst> But my vaccination will be for meningitis
<Quilava> except they could still kill it
<Quilava> like use it to block or something
<Altafk> /nick Altair

<Arcanine> 04that's why you don't play an attack deck

<Neon> "I can see as your king... king. As your arms bleed!"
<where> Duh.

<Arcanine> 04what i'm thinking is that i'd play that creature who is a black creature btw
<Arcanine> 04with a whole bunch of blue mill cards like your silly crab
<where> You're just cancelling it out
<Quilava> time warp :P
<LaptopAristeo> Hehe

<Arcanine> 04Ur thinking wtf, right?
<Arcanine> 04Here's how it works:
<Arcanine> 04First turn: Lay 7 (or 8) coupons down and set ur opponent scurrying around getting drinks. While they're gone, put the 100 cheatyfaces in your pocket into play.
<Stormy> what is a human clan?
<Arcanine> 04in case you don't know i looked into what ashnod's coupon does

<Icydragon> kay.
<Quilava> wow nice
<theguesst> mine is starting to diminish in sound quality from usage
<Arcanine> 04Quilava i can imagine that, your opponent drops like 8 of those coupons turn 1 so you have to get him 8 drinks, then when you get back there is like 100 cheatyfaces out
<SheenaFox> No you don't
<SheenaFox> it's all an illusion
<drf|laptop> 03you don't want to sell me death sticks

<Stormy> Still no
<LaptopAristeo> Awww
<Lambda> :P
<LaptopAristeo> okies
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Quilava> I just got an idea for a deck.
<Stormy> although I'm curious what this euphemism might be that would make a cult sound like a good thing
<Lambda> Stormy's staying on the sane side of society it seems
*Glacymr sells drf an apple
<Arcanine> 04i know you did D:
<Damos> join #PokemonParadise

<Lambda> *benefits
<Arcanine> 04i can't remember what it was though
<Light_Latias> o.o
<Stormy> And benefots too
<LaptopAristeo> New friends? :o
<Stormy> I can't think of any benefots a cult would have
<Proto> heh fots
*Arcanine hugs Light_Latias
<Lambda> I was thinking things like "free meetings with your lord" and stuff like that
<Lambda> "free poison"
<Lambda> you know
<where> \:O/
<Lambda> cult stuff
<where> FREE?
*where drinks
<DarkTruth> cyanide

<Lambderp> 90's emo bands make good moosix
<JLF> thinking the chronicler is a genie
<Altair> Hold down the lock and home buttons until it reboots XD
<Glacymr> 12i'm going to have to have a talk with him
<Lambderp> better than modern emo bands imo
<Glacymr> 12a serious talking
*Aicebo is currently listening to Pop Unknown
<Icydragon> No, he's a stoner...
<Sneas> 03ohisee
<Lambderp> ooh nice
<Sneas> 03xD
<Arcanine> 04fish
<Curly> thanks ^^
<OMG> Hello
<Sneas> 03stupid thing
<Lambderp> never heard of them actually
*Aicebo is assuming lambda does not know this band
<Lambderp> :P
<Aicebo> :P
<JLF> how old is the chronicler?
<Icydragon> Notice how misty it is, and how he's into rymes?
<JLF> his eyes are creepy
<JLF> the chronicler's
<Icydragon> STONER!
<JLF> lol
<Altair> oh my god
<Altair> its oh my god
*Aicebo wonders how Lambderp can form an opinion of a genre without knowing any bands within it
<Aicebo> :P
<JLF> hey anyone know when the chronicler shows spyro his book, why does it play broken soul?
<JLF> it doesn't play it on mine
<Lambderp> Jimmy Eat World
<OMG> Yes, I'm your god.
<Lambderp> great band
<OMG> Bow down to me!
<Lambderp> err wait
<Aicebo> jimmy eat world is not really 90's emo
<Lambderp> they're early-present 2000's
<Aicebo> nor is it that emo in general
<Aicebo> they are more--- yeah
<Altair> D:<
<LaptopAristeo> :D
<Aicebo> there is a different sound between the timeline right there but they are supposedly the same
<Lambderp> they're like the happier side of emo :D
<Aicebo> but you also can't really form an opinion of a genre from 1 band :P
<OMG> >:D
*where huggles LaptopAristeo in the face
<Lambderp> nah I guess not
<Icydragon> Me either.
<Lambderp> :P

<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<JLF> also i'd like to see malefor when he was young
<Lambderp> oh hey
<Armageddon> 02o.o
<Neon> Hey.
<Aicebo> sup neon
<Neon> Bad timing again?
<Icydragon> And sexy! ;D
<JLF> lol
<Lambderp> just talking about the moosix
<Lambderp> nope not at all
<Curly> hi Ari :3
<Lambderp> I'm still here
<Lambderp> wide awake
<Neon> Awesome.
<JLF> malefor seems to think spyro's just like him
<Neon> What musix?
<Lambderp> emo
<Lambderp> 90's
<Icydragon> :L
*Aicebo waits for neon to talk about how "obscure" his music is :P
<Armageddon> 02What names, Quilava?
<Armageddon> 02xxD
<Icydragon> :L
<Neon> Oh, the real emotive rock, then?
<Lambderp> mhm
<Icydragon> That face looks so cool.
<Icydragon> :L
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/
<JLF> lol
<Aicebo> ...lolwut
<Neon> Any particular names?
<OMG> Hello Glacymr
<Lambderp> XD
<Aicebo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG2FFpI5K3s
<Glacymr> 12hi
<JLF> the chronicler was wrong about cynder
<JLF> she didn't concede
<OMG> How are you?
<Neon> Cap'n Jazz... where Scary Kids Scaring Kids got their name.
<Aicebo> no I'm just telling lambda that he cant form an opinion of 90's/early 2000's from 1 band
<Aicebo> Neon: indeed.
<Icydragon> I thought you just said concieved. lol.
<Neon> Well, I suppose not.
<JLF> no concede
<JLF> he said she'd give in
<JLF> she didn't
<JLF> so he lied
<Neon> Unless that band is basically a symbol of the whole era/genre.
<Icydragon> I hate lol but I'm useing it!
<JLF> lia
<JLF> *liar
<JLF> he a liar
<Icydragon> He wanted spyro for himself. :L
<Aicebo> capn jazz is one of those but lambda only knows jimmy eat world
<JLF> he did?
<Aicebo> and jimmy eat world have gone more alt throughout this decade
<Aicebo> :P
<JLF> Shadowsfall what do u think?
*Lambderp is currently looking for a whole new kind of music
<Icydragon> Yeah, he has those pedo eyes...
<Neon> "Still eating the world, eh, Jimmy?'
<Lambderp> something like me
<JLF> lol
<JLF> i think he's not very wise
<Lambderp> something like... rock, but nerdier
<Lambderp> :P
<Neon> Like electronica? :P
<Lambderp> I suppose
<Lambderp> but that's too dance-y
<Aicebo> electronica never makes me think of rock music
<Lambderp> like alternative rock
<Neon> Radiohead blends it nicely. It 's not dance stuff.
<Armageddon> 02MULTI
<Aicebo> when I think of electronica I think of seabound and wolfsheim/peter heppner
<Icydragon> I'm telling you, he's getting blazed in that cave of his.
<Lambderp> where it's like rock but with synthesizers and all
<Neon> In Kid A and Amnesiac anyhow.

<Aicebo> uh oh
<Aicebo> ok then :P
<Icydragon> *sigh*
<JLF> u ok?
<JLF> i'm here if u need me
<Aurora> 6woah someone from brazil on the forums
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambderp and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Icydragon> I'm ok, thanks.
<Lambderp> woot!
<Aicebo> ?
<Neon> Oh, you scared me!
<Neon> That was /risky/!
<Aicebo> ..XD
<Lambderp> I just moved my IRC client onto a different hard drive
<JLF> ok
<Lambderp> a portable one no less
<Neon> :p
<Neon> Why?
<Lambderp> so now I can use it on any compiter
<Aicebo> cool
<Lambderp> *computer
<Neon> Oh, interesting.
<Lambderp> and to make my laptop faster
<Lambderp> too much junk on it
<Neon> I'm currently using a DviD cable to project my comp onto a TV screen. Beats a little Acer monitor. xD
<Lambderp> XD that's awesome
<Lambderp> If I did that I would definitely loose a lot of quality
<Lambderp> *lose
<Neon> Luckily I don't lose any, really. I suspect it'sd enhanced. :O
<Neon> But the sound is just a fraction of a second off, since it comes from my computer speakers.
<Lambderp> hmm
<Lambderp> that would make sensse
<Lambderp> ah
<Neon> If I hook up speakers to the HDTV, though, it might not lose any.
<Lambderp> do it.
*Aicebo uses a computer like everyone normal
<JLF> man i'm bored
<Lambderp> lol
<Lambderp> me too
<Lambderp> :P
<Icydragon> :3
<Neon> Did that video ever load?
<Lambderp> yeah listening to it now\
<Proto> wb Lambderp
*Neon must get hands on another set of speakers.
<Lambderp> sounds interesting now
<Lambderp> thanks
<Lambderp> just moved IceChat onto my new external hard drive
<Lambderp> I like this thing
<Proto> lol
<Icydragon> Me too. :P
<Neon> It's very eerie, or at least some of the other songs are on that album. There are few effects, but Morning Bell in the Related Videos is extremely cool. It's melodic and all that.
<Lambderp> it is very eerie
<Lambderp> that's a good word for it
<Neon> That's whaqt I like about it, but it's not for everyone.
<Lambderp> yeah
<Neon> Pyramid Song and Revolving Door take the cake on eerie.
<Lambderp> eerie isn't quite what I like
<Lambderp> but I can understand the appeal for it
<Neon> Eh, better luck next time/.
<Icydragon> Eh...
<Lambderp> I like soothing music
*Drake yawns
<Drake> 04back
<Lambderp> but not when it makes me think there's a ghost behind me
<Lambderp> :P
<Jerry> wb
<Neon> xD
<Neon> I get that.
<Lambderp> I'm not insulting your tastes by the way
<Lambderp> just expressing my own opinions of it
<JLF> lol
<Armageddon> 02wb
<Icydragon> Gotta go to bed...
<Neon> No, I didn't think you were at all.
<JLF> ok
<Icydragon> Goodnight.
<Lambderp> okay good
<JLF> goodnight
<Aicebo> Lambderp: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsnELWjsCsA

<Icydragon> *hugs*
<Lambderp> Ooh Modest Mouse
<Drake> 04ty
<Neon> Modest Mouse FTW!
<Lambderp> Yay!
<Lambderp> people are arguing about Halo 3 in the comments
<Lambderp> XD
<Neon> LOL
<Neon> Why Halo 3?
<Lambderp> no clue whatsoever
<Lambderp> ps
<Lambderp> "You suck at halo 3 and like [censored]s so why? would I be defensive about you sucking [censored]?"
<Lambderp> coolkid
<Lambderp> sozseatstaken 4 months ago
<Neon> I love when I post stati of songs or quotes and people are like "What does [insert common knowledge here] mean?"
<Lambderp> Haha yeah
<Neon> Lambderp: xD
<Lambderp> now this music I like
<Neon> You should hear more of Bran New then. They're similar in a few ways,
<Lambderp> Oh are you talking about the "Chew the fat" thing?
<Neon> *Brand
<Neon> xD Bran
<Neon> Yes.
*Aicebo <3s brand new
<Neon> That's not a great example, since chew the fact isn't used much anymore.
<Neon> *fat
<Lambderp> I knew what it meant
<Lambderp> amazed that person didn't
<Neon> But that girl is, quite frankly, a nub.
<Aicebo> omg, 21 year old children's movie editor guy is lazy at cutting songs
<Lambderp> haha
<Aicebo> what a [censored]
<Neon> Aicebo: You and your Clinton are just gonna keep struttin' that azz!"
*Lambderp youtube searches Brand Ne
<Lambderp> *New
*Aicebo remembers her friend's video of mei the goat's ass with the struttin that ass remix
<Neon> Lambderp: May I suggest basically anything on The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Of Me?
<Lambderp> okay this is an awesome song title
<Aicebo> Lambderp: listen to their song handcuffs
<Aicebo> Neon: you said you didnt like that album :P
<Lambderp> "I believe you but My Tommy Gun Don't"
<Lambderp> XDDDD
<Neon> Aicebo: Slander.
<Armageddon> 02;o
<Neon> Lambderp: "Good To Know That If I Ever Need Your Attention All I Have To Do Is Die."
<Aicebo> deja was my least favorite album out of them all but I like all their albums
<Lambderp> lololol I just searched for brand new handcuffs
<Neon> Sowing Season...
<Neon> Aicebo: When did I ever say I didn't like that album?
<Lambderp> so amazed I didn;t get some police videos
<Neon> I know, right?
<Neon> I'm not gonna lie, The Police were amazing.
<Lambderp> I don't mean The Police
<Lambderp> but yes
<Neon> Oh, what then?
<Lambderp> they were very amazing
<Aicebo> Neon: when we were talking about brand new on here one night you said "Deja was the only one I liked."
<Lambderp> "brand new handcuffs"
<Neon> I don't think I said only.
<Neon> Because I evern like Daisy a little.
<Aicebo> you did
<Lambderp> like a video of cops getting a new shipment of handcuffs or something
<Neon> *even
<Aicebo> you said the only song you liked on daisy was Bought a Bride that night too
<Neon> Oh, I gotcha.
<Neon> Yeah, I agree.
<Neon> Daisy's only good song, really.
<Aicebo> my fav on daisy was Noro
<Neon> Wait, was In A Jar on Daisy?
<Aicebo> yes it was
<Neon> Never mind. Two then.
<Neon> Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes...
<Aicebo> my fav albums go from Devil and God > Your Favorite Weapon > Daisy > Deja
<Neon> I don't think I liked much from YFW.
<Neon> It's been a while since I've heard it.
<Aicebo> I love the type of sound/music thats on that album
<Neon> Crap, "You Stole" was also good off of Daisy. I totally forgot about it.
<Lambderp> this is sort of unrelated
<Lambderp> but want to see something awesome?
<Neon> Sure.
<Lambderp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsWFFuYZYI
<Lambderp> being a former Lego fan you should appreciate it
<Neon> Haha, I love when people do 8-bit stufff.
<Aicebo> oh I seen that before
<Neon> I still love Lego.
<Lambderp> I think I showed you Aicebo
<Lambderp> I posted it here before
<Aicebo> you probably did lol
<Neon> DOUBLE RAINBOW
<Lambderp> XD
<Aicebo> neon I thought you were a bionicle dude
<Aicebo> :P
<Neon> Bionicle is made by Lego.
<Lambderp> bionicle = lego
<Aicebo> shows how much I know
<Aicebo> :P
<Lambderp> hence how I knew he like lego
<Neon> Haha.
<Lambderp> because I too was a Bionicle dude
<Lambderp> from the same forum no less
<Aicebo> lambda I'm not suprised
*Neon loves how he has like a hundred Bionicles MOCs in his closet.
*Aicebo loves how there was a bionicle movie
<Lambderp> Neon joined the forum like 5 years after I left it
<Lambderp> several actually
<Neon> Aicebo: There were 3 or 4.
<Aicebo> LMFAO
<Aicebo> REALLY????
<Lambderp> yep
<Neon> They were good.
<Aicebo> THAT'S....THAT'S....LOL
<Neon> When I was like elven.
<Lambderp> XDDDD
<Neon> *eleven
<Lambderp> I was gonna say...
<Armageddon> 02Arcanine
<Armageddon> 02I lol'd
<Lambderp> they kinda suck now
<Lambderp> but back then...
<Lambderp> oh man
<Armageddon> 02Well
<Neon> Do you remember the Visorak?
<Lambderp> like my first nerdgasm
*Armageddon pokes Glacymr and Quilava
<Armageddon> 02http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chatstats/index_relmap.png
<Lambderp> yeah
<Armageddon> 02congrats
<Aicebo> IM LAUGHIN SO MUCH OMGGGGG
<Lambderp> :P
<Neon> The movie about them, where the stone Toa Metru guy gets caqught in a cocoon still cracks me up when I remember it.
<Lambderp> Hahaha
<Neon> Everyone's complaining to Vakama, and he's just like: "ekjrkehrjthjr4thb" all Kenny-style.
<Lambderp> I actually lost interest before that movie
<Neon> It was my heyday.
<Lambderp> but I have a few of the toys
<Lambderp> my heyday was all the original stuff
<Lambderp> when it was all new
<Neon> 2005 was Star Wars Lego + Increasingly epic Bionicles.
<Lambderp> Oh yeah
<Lambderp> Star Wars legos were intense
<Lambderp> still are
<where> You can't back away from me Proto, I'm huggling you :3
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> I don't think people grow out of liking to build crap.
*Proto runs
<Proto> mwahahaah
<Proto> a
<Lambderp> yeah I don't think so
*where is still attatched :3
<Neon> It's the materials that change.
<Lambderp> I know I just stopped doing it
<Lambderp> yeah
<Lambderp> now I use computer programs to build stuff
<Neon> Exactly.
<Lambderp> instead of legoes
*Proto runs into a wall repeatedly
<Lambderp> *legos
<where> >:3
*where protoects Proto form getting hury
<where> hurt*
<where> :D
<Neon> This is funny yet I'm embarassed of it. During the volunteer work in NY, I got so bored I started playing with this little kid's K'nex.
<Lambderp> and all who love building have that little urge for destruction buried within them
*Proto is running into the wall to knock you loose D:<
<Neon> Yeah, totally.
<Lambderp> or at least I hope I'm not the only one
<Lambderp> XD
<Lambderp> a computer
<Lambderp> I want to smash a computer one day
<Neon> See what it's made of.
<Lambderp> a cheap one
<Lambderp> yeah exactly
<Neon> I did that with a GameBoy when I was younger.
<Neon> Stupid...
<Lambderp> it more ways than one
<Lambderp> "see what it's made of" I mean
<Neon> Right.
<Neon> Have you seen the vids of those people who throw game consoles from great heights just to see them smash, though?
<Lambderp> D:
<Lambderp> No
<Neon> They must be pretty spoiled, haha.
<Lambderp> Oh yeah
<Drake> 04LOL
<Lambderp> that's the thing
<Neon> It was back when it was so hard to get your hands on a Wii, too.
<Proto> o_o
<Lambderp> if I ever break anything like that it would have to not be pointless
<where> D:
<Neon> And this kid tries to return it, and they won't take it for some reason. so he throws it off of the parking garage near a mall.
<Lambderp> like a really old and really outdated computer that nobody woul take
<Neon> But yeah, I agree.
<Lambderp> wow
<Lambderp> he must be really spoiled
<Lambderp> kill the ghost
<Neon> I remember waiting in line overnight when they were really new.
<Lambderp> the Wii?
<where> wat
<Neon> Yeah, in like Feb. '07. I had saved up for like two years, albeit spending some but not a lot.
<Aicebo> I'm gonna try to go to a midnight showing of the gahoole movie, it'll be the first thing I wait all night for
<Neon> Hahaha.
<Lambderp> sounds like me with the 360
<Lambderp> I saved up for it for so long
<Neon> So there was an error and they didn't ship enough. We waited all night in the cold for nothing. xD
<Lambderp> XD
<Aicebo> lmao that sucks
<Neon> Yeah, see you know what I mean.
<Lambderp> it's weird too
<Lambderp> having a full time job it doesn't take that long to get that much money now
<Lambderp> but back then
<Neon> Yeah, it must be nice.
<Lambderp> it took like two years
<Neon> But now you have more stuff to pay for.
<Lambderp> no because I'm afraid of spending it on fun stuff
<Lambderp> afraid I'll need it for school or something
<Neon> No, I mean like now you have to pay for gas and stuff you didn't when you were younger.
<Lambderp> oh right
<Lambderp> yeah that too
<Lambderp> I've been working all summer
<Neon> Walmart is a cruel master, I hear.
<Lambderp> and the only things I've boughtne for myself that costed more than $10 were Red Dead Redemption and this hard drive
<Lambderp> not my master any longer
<Lambderp> and they really aren't
<Neon> Oh, right.
<Lambderp> they're pretty lax actually
<Lambderp> too la even
<Lambderp> *lax
*Neon nods.
<Neon> Like Snorlax?
<Lambderp> XD
<Lambderp> I guess so
<Lambderp> or at least my Walmart
<Neon> Oh, I have something you guys will appreciate.
<Lambderp> Stormy's sounds a bit more well organized
<Lambderp> Infamous's sounds like mine though
<Lambderp> lazy managers and all
<Lambderp> what is it?
<Neon> Mhm.
<Neon> Hold on, a vid, again. :/
<Lambderp> haha okay
<Lambderp> eh I should be getting to sleep soon too
<Lambderp> i'll wait like ten more minutes
<Neon> It's like a big sexual innuendo thing... but with Pokemon... yet totally hilarious.
<Lambderp> (GHOST command used by where_!where@9A4A5C.DCF3AA.A7B92E.8AE4CD))
<Neon> Do you want it? xD
<Lambderp> I know that it isn't what it means
<Lambderp> but eh
<Lambderp> oh well
<Proto> l
<Proto> o
<Proto> l
<Aicebo> is it the jynx evolution with boobs
<Neon> No!
<Lambderp> oh I wtched this
<Neon> It's a song with the original 161 in puns./
<Neon> *151
<Lambderp> the rap that you linked to on facebook
<Aicebo> with the song that goes "what kinda pokemon are you, how do you do those things you do? share with me your secrets deep inside!"
<Neon> Lambderp: Oh, you saw it?
<Lambderp> yeah
<where> lol
<Neon> The Birds And The Beedrills. xD
<where> it's for if you ping timeout
<Lambderp> Yep
<where> and come back
<where> And you're still in here
<where> it removes the 'ghost' copy
<Proto> I think he knows what it does where
<Lambderp> now I get all these rap videos in my recommended videos
<Lambderp> :P
<Proto> he was trying to make a joke
<where> Oh.
<Neon> Lololololol.
<Neon> Did you think it was funny?
<Lambderp> but yeah I tend to take a look at a lot of what you put on teh book of facez
*where may be taking Lambderp's name a little too strongly.
<Lambderp> I thought so yeah
<Neon> Yay, attention.
<Lambderp> you have a similar sense of humor to mine
<Neon> Well, now you even know what I look like.
<Neon> Gig's over. xD
<Lambderp> but you, unlike me, actually post your humor there
<Lambderp> lol yeah
<Neon> Lambderp: It's what makes Facebook bearbale for me.
<Lambderp> I was actually really shocked when I saw you put a real picture of yourself
<Neon> *bearable
<Lambderp> bearbale
<Lambderp> XD
<Neon> Everyone was. I haven't in the three years I've used Facebook.
<Lambderp> I read that as bear bile
<Neon> XD
<Neon> That pic is over a year old, though.
<Lambderp> "the bear bile of facebook"
<Neon> Hahaha.
<Lambderp> so that pic is lil' Neon so to speak?
<Neon> I guess. I'm several inches taller now.
<Neon> And I lost some weight.
<Lambderp> :P
<Aicebo> if your going to say "lil neon" you should say "lil knee awn" instead
<Aicebo> it can be his rapper name
<Aicebo> :D
<Lambderp> Proto's right
<Neon> Knee-On: Apply directly to the knee.
<Aicebo> thats your rapper phrase
<Aicebo> :D
<Lambderp> I just sometimes fail at making it clear that my jokes are, in fact, jokes
<Omeghurr> :q
<Lambderp> XD
<Lambderp> lil knee awn
<Neon> Lil' Nikeeshka.
<Lambderp> D:
*Curly flops with a sandwich and coffee
<Aicebo> lol, 21 year old amv maker guy just randomly told me he hated me because of his family problems
<Neon> Alarmed face.
<Lambderp> ixr calls me lil Lambda ll the time
<Aicebo> what a [censored]
*Proto catches the flopping Curly
<Proto> wb
<Lambderp> Aicebo: wtf is his problem?
<Thingdurr> >.>
<Neon> Aicebo: What do his family problems have to do with you?
<Aicebo> idk he's stupid lol
<Lambderp> Thingdurr!
<Lambderp> Thingdurr!
<Thingdurr> lol
<Neon> WAT U SAY TO TEH ALMIGHTY THONGS
<Aicebo> I asked him how it was at all revelant to anything we were saying
<Thingdurr> derp
<Lambderp> hello
<Lambderp> from America
<Aicebo> idk he's one of those people that tries to brag about being an adult and all his adult problems
<Proto> Hey Thingdurr
<Curly> thanks :)
<Aicebo> he's almost as worse as sooty
<Proto> You're welcome^^
*Thingdurr waves from atop a tall tower
<Proto> Still no dichro
<Proto> ?*
<Thingdurr> hurr durr
<Neon> "You wouldn't understand! You're like, not even half an adult. Once you turn a certain age, life beings to cruuuuuumble around you!"
<Aicebo> yes he's one of those people
<Thingdurr> u bah teasin mah
<Thingdurr> :P
<Proto> >_>
<Aicebo> he kept bragging and babbling about his girlfriend yesterday
<Neon> Sooty works at Goody's. xD
<Lambderp> what's a dichro?
<Proto> dichroic filter
*Omeghurr derp
<Proto> It passes light of a certain wavelength
<Neon> I'd be ashamed to even be in any way related to a place called Goody's.
<Lambderp> oh
<Omeghurr> God Lambderp.
<Proto> and reflects other wavelengths
<Lambderp> laz0r stuff?
<Omeghurr> N00b.
<Aicebo> same
<Lambderp> Ah I see
<Lambderp> that makes sense
<Lambderp> I am a n00b when it comes to science
<Omeghurr> lol
<Lambderp> I know little about science
<Thingdurr> Yet your name is the character for wavelength
<Thingdurr> >.>
<Proto> Thingdurr, someone asked if the blue glow from a 445 would cause cancer
<Lambderp> Hahaha
<Thingdurr> Well
<Proto> haha pwnt
<Thingdurr> symbol
<Thingdurr> w/e u wanna call it
<Lambderp> also the logo for Half Life
<Lambderp> :P
<Lambderp> hence why I use it
<Proto> Physics came first :P
<Neon> Well, I'm going to go also, since I have to wake up at like 9 tomorrow.
<Thingdurr> lol
<Lambderp> you're right though
<Neon> BTW, Lambda, I made a fan page for Baby Priest on Facebook. xD
<Lambderp> the reason it's the game's logo is because of science
<Omeghurr> And hence why I picked omega to use as my nick now :p
<Thingdurr> haha
<Aicebo> gnite
<Lambderp> so being someone who doesn't care for science I really shouldn't be using it as a name XD
<Omeghurr> indeed.
<Neon> I'll stick around until he responds.
<Omeghurr> I've had to stop Proto murdering you three times already.
<Lambderp> Hahaha
<Lambderp> Oh hi
<Lambderp> sorry

<Proto> :(
<Lambderp> notice how they're all copying my name too
<Lambderp> "Omeghurr" and "Thingdurr"
<Neon> I hate when people make you feel inferior because you're not knowledgeable in one subject, typically one you have little interest in.
<Lambderp> eh they have a point though
<Neon> Why, the name?
<Lambderp> I should've used a different nerdy reference when I chose my name
<Lambderp> yeah
<Lambderp> Half Life is a science based game after all
<Neon> Mine is Neon, but I don't know much about it other than its a noble gas and reddish-orange.
<Lambderp> true
<Neon> The name originates from an acronym, though.
<Lambderp> I think you told me once
<Lambderp> what was it again?

<Aicebo> "oh that's what I thought lol" yeah, I'm sure.
<Lambderp> I know right
<Neon> LAmbderp: Yeah... it was lulzworthy.
<Lambderp> sje just doesn't want to sound dumb
<Lambderp> \I stir our son's ice cream poop.
<Neon> Aicebo: She is the subject of very much torment from me.
<Lambderp> XD
<Neon> Earlier her phone died and my friends and I text-spammed her with nonsense. There were like 60 message total so when she turns it on it'll be several minutes of textx before she can use it. XDDD
<Neon> *texts
<Lambderp> XDDDD
<Lambderp> that's awesome
<Aicebo> hahahaha
<Neon> My other friend did this to my other other friend, during a quiet meeting somewhere, and it was like 80 messages referring to [censored]es.
<Aicebo> that reminds me of when my uncle damian didn't know how to use the phone, I wake up every morning and I got texts with him fighting with some girl about taking care of a baby
<Neon> He couldn't shut it off before like thirty seconds of noise.
<Aicebo> because apparently the texts he made were sent to everyone in his contacts
<Aicebo> and I'd get totally spammed with crap about a baby
<Neon> LOL
<Lambderp> XD
<Lambderp> my roommate's phone did that
<Aicebo> like i got one that says "you have to take care of him he cries he poops"
<Lambderp> ...which means I got texts meant ofr his girlfriend
<Aicebo> and another that said "now I'm feeding the [censored]er"
<Lambderp> that was...awkward
<Lambderp> wow
<Lambderp> sounds like yours was awkward too
<Lambderp> XD
*Neon laughs.
<Neon> A lot.
<Lambderp> you have to take care of him he cries he poops
<Lambderp> oh wow
<Neon> She explains that she is nursing the kid? xD
<Lambderp> Steveworthy?
<Neon> I think so.
<Aicebo> no those texts are from my uncle fighitng with some girl about it
<Aicebo> and it's not even his kid I know that for sure
<Aicebo> I think it was his girlfriend's underage daughter
<Lambderp> @addquote <Uncle> you have to take care of him he cries he poops
<Lambderp> aww
<Lambderp> didn't word
<Neon> This time you need !addquote
<Lambderp> !addquote <Uncle> you have to take care of him he cries he poops
<Neon> XD
<Aicebo> lol
<Aicebo> actually I think it was "it" instead of "he"
<Lambderp> the lack of punctuation makes it so much funnier
<Lambderp> I am tearing up from laughter
<Lambderp> or maybe I'm just toom tired
<Lambderp> *too
<Aicebo> that stuff happens to me sometimes its called being high on life
<Lambderp> oh amn

<Prince-dari> Well, no one calls it that, anyway.
<Lambderp> very few people call it that here

<Neon> I'm not tired at all, though, but I'd hate to fall asleep tomorrow.
<Lambda> I'm really tired
<Lambda> and I slept in way too late today
<Prince-dari> Steve is all that is left in #jailbait
<Lambda> but I was home alone so it doesn't matter
<Lambda> tomorrow however
<Neon> I was up all night last night, and took a quick nap for like an hour earlier last night and that's it.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> nice
<Neon> Haha, #jailbait.
<Neon> I had to wake up at 5:30 yesterday so there was no point in sleeping/
<Lambda> heh
<Lambda> I know what you mean
<Lambda> I hate nights like that
<Lambda> I lie sleep
<Lambda> *like
<Neon> Well, there is, but the logic is lost on me.
<Lambda> it's like a commodity for me
<Lambda> it's hard to get so I try to enjoy it when I can
<Lambda> actually, my insomnia is actually way better lately
<Prince-dari> Sleep is contrabrand, you must stay on the chat, Lambda!
<Neon> Sleep is like my antithesis to being what I consider "productive", which sadly enough, is how much lulz is created in a day.
<Lambda> oh I will
<Lambda> for at least another 20 minutes
<Neon> Lambda: Do it for your country.
<Lambda> I do not understand, Neon
<Neon> What I mean is, if I sleep, I am not creating lulz, thus sleep is not viable.
<Lambda> you create a full night's sleep worth of lulz every day?
<Lambda> ah
<Lambda> I see
<Neon> I'm more kidding now, but I really don't see much value in sleeping if I can run on a low tank.
<Lambda> I hate running on a low tank so much I always try to get sleep
<Neon> Dari: Have you seen the Baby Priest vid yet?
<Lambda> but say I had to get up at like 6 tomorrow
<Prince-dari> No... O_o
<ixr_> Isnt it past you guyses bed times
<Lambda> then I would accept it as a lost cause
<Prince-dari> Currently I set my own bed time.
<Lambda> ixr_: NO!
<Neon> Ixr: It's past my furfue.

<Jerry> from what my alert says
<Neon> You have to wonder how much the guy who wrote the subtitles actually messed with it, though.
<Lambda> ixr can you click youtube links?
<Neon> Because sometimes what the baby says doesn't quite match and it's more wishful.
<Lambda> yeah
<Jerry> doubt it's right

<Neon> Kjakings keeps trying to make me read a Pokemon fanfic that took about three years to compile. xD
<Lambda> hahaha
<Lambda> did he write it?
<Lambda> If so I would so read it
<Neon> No, some guy he knows.
<Lambda> aww
<Lambda> no fun
<Neon> But it's painfully lengthy, like... okay, I won't say it.
<Lambda> I can only imagine what kja would write
<Lambda> O.o
<Prince-dari> I'm sure it would involve death and destruction. Lol.
<Neon> BOOM AND THE POKEMON SPLODED IN VIOLENCE BUT WITH A TINGE OF SCI-FI EFFECT
<Lambda> pretty much
<Neon> He said the premise of the fanfic is "What if Pokemon didn't faint, they died, and so they form alliances and beat the sh** out of each other."
<Steve> 12 Hello, LaptopAristeo` and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

<ixr> Hmm
<Prince-dari> "The pikachu glared at me, cheeks flashing. *BOOM* HEADSHOT "It was no match for my shotgun"
<Neon> xD
<Neon> Exactly.
<Lambda> ixr: "pika-- CHOOO!"
<Neon> Only it's poorly-written.
<Prince-dari> That's what I think Kjakings would write. XD
<Neon> It said that Ho-oh "barked" something once.
<Lambda> He would XD
<Prince-dari> Neon: LOL
<ixr> Sneeze
<Neon> Lol, there was a creative aspect, though.

<Prince-dari> LOL, I'm still on when Aicebo goes to bed.
<Lambda> night everyone
<Neon> I remember when I was little, and had basically no brain, I tried to keep myself awake because I was afraid of losing consciousness.
<Prince-dari> Cya Lambda.
<Neon> Bye, Lambda.
<Lambda> XD NEon
<Prince-dari> "I must not lose consciousness, what if I can't find it again?" D:
<Neon> So I was on day four of "no sleep" and kept trying to play Battlefront II but dozing off while playing. Like my fingers moved and all, but I was alssep. It was funny.
<Prince-dari> LOL
<Neon> Dari: It was lost midway on the path of life.
<Neon> *asleep
<Neon> THE BIRDS OUTSIDE ARE C-CAWING
<Prince-dari> Mine only do that when they know it'll make me feel like shit.
<Prince-dari> "Noooooooooooooooooo, morning"
<ixr> Bwha

<Neon> Ixr: Go back in your pit.
<Prince-dari> BRB, highlight me if you want to talk to me.
<Neon> Okay.
<Neon> I'mma go to sleep, though.
<Neon> And all my friends say "Bye, bye..."
<ixr> My pit?
<ixr> My pit??

<ixr> But maybe im just crazy like that

<Kipi> Well for the most part. I joined the gym this week. I think i hurt my elbow somewhere though. Lesse... college starts in two weeks 'n' I'm desperately lookin' for a job. Been meetin' some new people online though so... you know. Annnnd... I'm currently on a laptop
<Articuno> 12Good luck finding your job :> where'd you get the laptop?
<Kipi> XP Figure though. The one time I CAN get on Neopets, I forgot my password and it's taking them forever sending me a new one through email. You'd think there's a guy going through them one-by-one by how slow it is
<Kipi> and I'm using my couin's laptop while I babysit
<Kipi> lol... actually, I found an old email with the password on it

<Articuno> 12@ DA not you
<TimeShift> dunno
<TimeShift> maybe they think another thing MIGHT be able to happen during a search - besides an "error"

<TimeShift> like
<TimeShift> "A tsunami occured while performing your search. Please try again shortly."

<Armageddon> 02I still love Pirates of the Caribbean
<Armageddon> 02And Xeli, he did
<Drake> 04lol
<Armageddon> 02Even go look
<Espeon> i already did
<Espeon> me and you still have those silly banners saying mod and admin wat
<Drake> 04gah
<Drake> 04brb...maybe
<Armageddon> 02o.o
<Armageddon> 02Yeah I know
<TimeShift> did you know a 747 blows out about 8 tons of fuel if it needs to abort a landing attempt?
<Espeon> Really, Ben is either an evil mastermind trying to make the entire internet angry - the God of Trolls - or he's terminally stupid
<Articuno> 12WOAH
<Articuno> 12No XD
<TimeShift> yes
<Articuno> 12How high off the ground by this point, though?
<Armageddon> 02XD
<Armageddon> 02Hey
<Armageddon> 02I was typically the only admin who did something useful
<TimeShift> wheels almost touching the ground
<Armageddon> 02or moderated properly for that reason
<Articuno> 12Sheesh.
<TimeShift> that's the amout for an emergency-go-around
<Armageddon> 02I mean seriously
<Armageddon> 02All those thread
<Armageddon> 02s
<Armageddon> 02I'm not even going to say what I went through
<Espeon> I can see him tell his members to "troll" "New GV"
<TimeShift> and the fuel is only good for one of those maneuvers
<Espeon> I mean the only people who are really happy about it being back is him + this chainsawfangirl person
<TimeShift> because, to carry these 8 tons of extra-fuel, the plane needs around 12 tons of fuel itself from the start
<Espeon> well i guess he gets a kick out of it, w/ever
<Armageddon> 02If he does try that
<TimeShift> the fuel calculations itself is fun, too
<Armageddon> I'm going to <censored> his site over so badly it won't be funny
<Armageddon> 02and/or report him to forumotions
<Espeon> Make that or
<TimeShift> calculate distance, calculate average flight speed, calculate average windspeed = time to destination in hours
<TimeShift> multiply hours with 30 liters of fuel
<Espeon> just report him to fmotions if he reports the site. He's reportable for member abuse or something I bet.
<TimeShift> calculate alternate airport
<TimeShift> add fuel for distance to alternate airport
<Armageddon> 02XD
<TimeShift> add 15 liters emergency reserve
<TimeShift> add 10% inproper maneuvering reserve
<TimeShift> result: Amout of needed fuel
<Espeon> Can't wait to see his response to calmly asked questions
<Espeon> might dc nao
<Armageddon> 02D:
<Espeon> just for like a minute xD
<Espeon> dc?

<Articuno> 12probably a lack of people due to DNS change
<Quanyails> 7Is everything with the servers settled?

*Curly huggles x.x
<Espeon> I don't normally get annoyed at people over the internet, but this guy ... the wall BEHIND me has a pawprint due to FACEPAW OVERKILL
<Andres> x.x to huggles sounds like you do not want huggles D:
<Curly> nooo, I'm just kind of tired x_x

*Shy wonders if theres any nice people here that would let him connect to freenode through them
<Proto> wb
<TimeShift> bleh, I just remember the maybe most-evil interview I've ever been told of^^
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<TimeShift> interview for a flight controller
<TimeShift> think about a really GIANT room - you enter a door on the one side and have to walk all the way to the other side of the room to three people sitting there and waiting for you
<TimeShift> you're half the way and one of them says "you forgot to close the door"
<TimeShift> how do you react?
<Quanyails> 7I'd close the door?
<Altair> Smile and close that door :P
<TimeShift> so you'll turn around, see: The door's already closed
<Quanyails> 7This reminds me of an urban legend.
<Altair> Smile and say "what"
<TimeShift> question: "Are you always that forgetful? Unsure? Don't you know anymore what you've done just a minute before?"
<TimeShift> again the question: How do you react?
<TimeShift> in case you just respond "I've already closed the door" you'll be asked "so you never double-check what you do? You think you're perfect and make no errors?"
<TimeShift> that's just one example of this interview: No matter how you react or what you answer, it will always be wrong
<Proto> welcome back :)

<Glacymr> 12*not awake
<Proto> hai Lambda
<Lambda> hai
<Proto> Trying to get to the minus world
<Proto> is difficult
<Lambda> lol
<Glacymr> 12have you thought about magic workstation?
<Glacymr> 12or are you still doing research to make sure it isn't a virus? lol
<Proto> srsly wtf meng
<Curly> what mario game are you playing Proto?
<Proto> Super Mario Brothers
<Proto> the original one that came bundled with the NES
<Proto> along with duck hunt, the dual game
<Curly> oh, okay. I thought you were play smw3 so I was wondering >.>;
<Proto> hehe
<Curly> The original minus world from Super Mario Bros. is the Trope Namer. The player can reach it by entering a pipe in the first Warp Zone after walking through a wall (thus, before the Warp Zone message appears). It consisted of the level design of the Water Level 2-2 repeating over and over.
<Proto> yep
<Curly> oh *just noticed the "walking through a wall" bit*
<Proto> it's very difficult
<Proto> haha
<Curly> it sounded simple until I saw that xD
<Proto> you have to break two bricks, and not the one right up against the pipe part that goes up
<Icyectonurite> I dari!
<Proto> and then jump backwards crouched up to there, standing up and you walk through the wall
<Proto> I keep breaking the last block
<Icyectonurite> 5Cynder7!
<Icyectonurite> 5Hai!
<Cynder7> 6Hey
<Icyectonurite> 5It's actually me Gemini101, but I'm just using a nickname, so...
<Cynder7> 6I knows :P
<Icyectonurite> 5So, what's been going on?
<Cynder7> 6Nothing much..I'm just in a horrible mood since 2 am because of my fucking friend.
<Curly> get lunar magic and use savestates :p
<Icyectonurite> 5Ooh... whut happened?
<Proto> hehe
<Curly> lol, I like how all these youtube comments are trying to correct the -1 thing and they all give different numbers for the world bit
<Cynder7> 6She had one of her mood swings and it affected me..Around 3 am, I was pissed like hell and on the verge of tears.Next thing I know I had started crying.And one minute later,I was laughing my ass off for no reason.Now I've burst to tears two times in the past hour.
<Curly> "it's 36-1" "you went to 46-1" "this is world 0-1"
<Icyectonurite> 5C.o
<Curly> >_>
<Proto> xD
<Proto> GAH
<Proto> I had it
<Icyectonurite> 5Wow.
<Proto> he hung up on the edge
<Proto> ;-;
<Cynder7> 6Indeed.
<Curly> I don't like Super Mario Bros much myself
<Cynder7> 6Idk why it affected me so badly..
<Curly> but I don't have any nostalgia going for it >.>
<Proto> heh
*Icyectonurite 5looks up then looks Cynder7
*Curly never had an NES and barely ever played on one
<Curly> the most memorable game on the NES for me was Kirby ... something. Superstar maybe
<Proto> I bought this thing two years ago for $8
<Proto> lol
<Proto> :o
<Proto> my favorite is legend of zelda, despite being terrible at it
*Icyectonurite 5feels nostalgic
<Curly> I think I played that once, ever :p
<Proto> :3
<Curly> and I'm pretty sure I was only watching
<Lambda> I like the N64 Zelda games bettar
<Cynder7> 6):
<Curly> me too ^^
<Curly> Majora's Mask was just okay though
<Proto> my N64 got stolen :|
<Lambda> I never really played much NES though
<Lambda> I agree
*Icyectonurite 5looks up. She is worried.
<Lambda> Ocarina of Time was just epic
<Curly> I never got OoT :(
<Curly> I need to buy it off of ebay one of these days
<Proto> :(
<Curly> along with Conker's Bad Fur Day >.>
<Proto> I should see about getting another N64
<Proto> It wouldn't be the same though...first video games I ever played were on that N64 x_X
<Curly> there might be a few more N64 games I would have liked to own but I can't remember
<Proto> I liked one of the toy story ones
<Proto> I'd always give my dad the controller for one of the bosses
<Proto> >_>
<Proto> oooh
<Proto> and vigilante 8
<Curly> never played or seen either of those... although vigilante 8 sounds really familiar >.>
<Cynder7> 6D:
*Curly thinks she might have seen a review somewhere
<Proto> I only had vigilante 8 second offense
<Ripred> yay chats back up :D
<Proto> Great game
<Proto> I loved the lunar rover >_>

<Icyectonurite> 5And though I'd like to stand by him

<Andres> I do not like coffee.
<tricky> Ah, I see
<tricky> Any specific type of tea?
<Andres> Blaaaaack :o
<tricky> I'm just remembering a really nice cup of oolong I once had in beijing...
<Andres> I like Earl Grey the most, but I do not appear to find a single store selling some.
<tricky> Didn't taste the same trying to make it myself :(
<tricky> Hmm..
<tricky> Too much hassle to order it online?
<Lugia> I am on now ^^'
<Andres> Considering I do not have any methods of payment that would work online, that is indeed so.

<Hawkie> Lugia
<Lugia> Hawkie
*Hawkie pokes
<Lugia> How are you?
<Raccoon> that's something perhaps worth correcting
<Andres> Bah, who gives credit cards to hitmen, seriously? D:
<Andres> The income is good, but not steady.
<Raccoon> debit cards work too
<Raccoon> checking accounts without debit cards work too
<Raccoon> but seriously, what checking account doesn't come with a visa debit
<Andres> Most such payments are pretty much restricted to the USA, are they not?
<Quanyails> 7How's the project going, Lugia?
<Raccoon> PayPal is accepted pretty much world wide, isn't it?
<Tricky> Mmhmm
<Raccoon> and uh, so is visa
<Andres> And MasterCard and other such stuff. :o
<Andres> Visa Electron doesn't exactly qualify for such things though and I have no way of transfering money to PayPal.
<Raccoon> have you tried?
<Raccoon> sure, i live in the US, but I'm pretty sure PayPal has methods for transfering money via bank wire... aka checking account.
<Raccoon> thats how they do it here
<Andres> No, no moneys :3
<Andres> "PayPal does not currently offer the ability to add funds from your bank account. "

<Kipi> Hullo, Lady Arti.
<Quanyails> 7Hi, Arti.
<Quanyails> 7Lugia's on.
<theguesst> I wish the forums were up. I want to see if anyone likes my fanfiction prelude.
<Shadowabsol> 14I don't use the forums much anymore anyways, so it really don't affect me. <_<;
<theguesst> I just want to share what I've created in my own mind with everyone else
<Kipi> You can post it on dA and share it here
<Kipi> Problem solved
<Kipi> The world is saved
<theguesst> I din't use dA
<Kipi> Etcetera, etcetera
<theguesst> don't*
<Kipi> GOOD
<Shadowabsol> 14WHUT?!?!
<Kipi> dA doesn't want you. D:<
<theguesst> It would be better if I didn't
<theguesst> no they dont
<Shadowabsol> 14Why?
<Shadowabsol> 14I use dA all the timez.
<theguesst> Because I'm not an artist
<Shadowabsol> 14Literature is an art.
<theguesst> I know it is
<Shadowabsol> 14That's why they call it language arts! :D
<theguesst> I just think it would be ridiculous if i did
<Kipi> oh snaps
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Shadowabsol> 14How would it be ridiculous? There are plenty of people on dA that use it just for writing purposes.
<theguesst> bbl
<Shadowabsol> 14Well, then! :<

<drf|laptop> 03LOLwut
<Kipi> You've obviously never heard of the batmobile or the Spy Cruiser
<drf|laptop> 03I've heard of them, that doesn't mean I'm in one
<Kipi> Have you tried to be in one?
<Shadowabsol> 14Well you certainly didn't imply that you AREN'T in one.
<drf|laptop> 03My parents are not Batman
<drf|laptop> 03so that should narrow that down for you.
<Kipi> Are they spies?
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Kipi> That's exactly what a good spy would make you think.
<Shadowabsol> 14So they really are spies?
<Cyndi> 10GAH I GIVE UP

<Kipi> Bunnies need to gnaw. :o
<Kipi> Granted, my teeth don't grow as fast or as much as bunnies, but still
<Shadowabsol> 14But they don't need to gnaw on Absol horns.

<Kipi> Feather probably did it, Shadowabsol.
<Shadowabsol> 14Why would Feather do that? :(
<drf|laptop> 03stupid girls and shoe shopping
<Shadowabsol> 14I hate shoe shopping.
<drf|laptop> 03they're seriously trying to find a shoe store on our way home so they can buy some stupid boots or something before the place closes >_>
<drf|laptop> 03Those shoes will be there another day!!
<Kipi> Not unless a meteor hits them
<Shadowabsol> 14That seems probable at the moment.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Quanyails> 7Hi. Feather.
*drf|laptop dies
<drf|laptop> 03those shoes will also not be there if the blasted o3o face kills everyone in the store
<drf|laptop> 03which, knowing everyone here, is even more probable than a meteor
<Silver> say sorry to arti from me if you saw her k?
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Shadowabsol> 14What's wrong with the o3o face?
<Michel> good night everyone
<drf|laptop> 03Everything is wrong with it.
<Feather> 10>_<
<drf|laptop> 03that face is as wrong as murder
<Quanyails> 7Bad connection, Feathie?
<Shadowabsol> 14Murder's not wrong.
<Shadowabsol> 14... Depending on how you look at it.
<Feather> 10my router is messed up (more than before lol)
<drf|laptop> 03LOL WTF
<drf|laptop> 03in that case

<Quanyails> 7DRF, what would the cause be?
<drf|laptop> 03what cause?
<drf|laptop> 03<Shadowabsol> Murder's not wrong. <- that
<Shadowabsol> 14Well I have something of a point, don't I?
<Articuno> 12No
<Articuno> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03Nope

<Articuno> 12Also hi
<Articuno> 12Im back
<Articuno> 12Recovering
*Quanyails 7blinks
<Quanyails> 7Is it wrong to kill in self-defense, DRF?
<Andrew> heya, is xai okay?
<drf|laptop> 03um
<Shadowabsol> 14Apparently it is if you can go to jail for it.
<drf|laptop> 03in some situations no but that's very rare
<Shadowabsol> 14Then again that's a matter of opinion.
<drf|laptop> 03like 99.99999% of murders aren't OK
<Quanyails> 7Then what do you say about, let's say, war?
<Shadowabsol> 14burn
*Shadowabsol 14hides.
<Articuno> 12Oh ya Xai's absolutely FINE Â¬Â¬
<drf|laptop> 03Um, yeah let's not get into this discussion about what's right and wrong
<drf|laptop> 03point being that o3o face is annoying
<drf|laptop> 03end of discussion
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Shadowabsol> 14It's amazing what conversations that face can bring up.
<Articuno> 12LOOOOLZ
<Quanyails> 7Arti, you know, if a lack of Lugia isn't allowing you to continue with the project, you can do that double meme. :P
<Articuno> 12I once put a kill script on it
<Articuno> 12Quan, I;'ve tried ^^; its hard
<Quanyails> 7How so?
<Articuno> 12i'm not as good as I used to be, I'm more picky with things
<drf|laptop> 03sigh
<drf|laptop> 03battery's almost dead
<Quanyails> 7Ah.
<drf|laptop> 03I'll prolly have to disconnect in a few mins
<drf|laptop> 03and put my other battery in
*drf|laptop rages at the idiot who sold me this power inverter
<Quanyails> 7Take your time, Arti. :3
<Articuno> 12How about the idiot that created o3o LOLOL
<drf|laptop> 03Haha
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Articuno> 12Not that I find it that bad
<Articuno> 12I just find it funny that DRF does :3
<Shadowabsol> 14OR you can use shock therapy to bring your dead battery back to life.
<drf|laptop> 03it wouldn't have been but it's one of those things that's had its time
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03remember when everyone and their brother wore wristbands?
<drf|laptop> 03Now it's stupid to do that
<drf|laptop> 03that o3o face is the same way
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and Shadowabsol, LOL, shame that doesn't work on laptop batteries
<drf|laptop> 03I do have another battery, I bought a spare for times like this
<drf|laptop> 03but regardless I bought a power inverter that supposedly let me plug my laptop in the car but the stupid thing isn't powerful enough ><
<Shadowabsol> 14return it and get a new one
<Articuno> 12OMG LOL at this
<Articuno> 12http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8075/vid01217.jpg

<Tiel> MS Paint for the effin' wiiiinnn~
<TimeShift> they just show a documentary on TV about two germans founding an italian restaurant in New York....and they just got into the "best pizzeria in town"....
<TimeShift> and...oh gawd

<drf|laptop> 03EW TELLING PARENTS TO SPY ON THEIR KIDS
<drf|laptop> 03we just drove by a billboard that said:

<drf|laptop> 03EW INVASION OF PRIVACY
<Tiel> ick D:
<Tiel> well
<drf|laptop> 03also
<drf|laptop> 03:)
*drf|laptop hides
<Tiel> I think the parents should know at least slightly
<Steve> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Tiel> especially if their kid is young
<drf|laptop> 03meh
<Aicebo> hi
<Lambda> hey
<Quanyails> 7You know what I just realized? That link I told you was saved as a JPG. :|
<Aicebo> whats up
<Lambda> eh
<Kjakings> 7evening all
<Lambda> hey kja
<Articuno> 12Off out..
<Quanyails> 7D:
*Aicebo is boredly playing pokemon heartgold
<Lambda> lol
<Aicebo> what pokemon types are best against steel
<Lambda> fire
<Aicebo> cool
<Lambda> and that's the only one I know
<Aicebo> I need to raise my growlithe
<Espeon> You sure dislike JPG xD
<Aicebo> I named him HURRRMAGIC
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> more like HUURRFIAH
<drf|laptop> 03well Paint notoriously sucks at it
<Aicebo> ....[censored] I should've named him that
<Kjakings> 7I've taken a different track to my normal strategy in SS: instead of training one Pokemon to the detriment of others, I just haven't bothered to train any
<Quanyails> 7It reduces quality, Espeon, that's all.
<Lambda> lol
<Aicebo> LOL
<Kjakings> 7I've only beaten like 3 Kanto gyms
<Kjakings> 7one of which was Misty, which I absolutely DEMOLISHED with Jolteon
<Quanyails> 7But when it comes to pixel art...
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
*Quanyails 7suddenly realizes she needs to lighten up.
<Kjakings> 7also, where are the other two legendary birds? Articuno is in the right place, but Zapdos has been ousted by the fixed power plant
*Quanyails 7looks at memes.
<Aicebo> moltres
<Kjakings> 7and I never bothered to properly explore Victory Road
<Kjakings> 7though I did find that Karate King bloke in it
<Kjakings> 7not at the right time, and now I can't find it again, but still
*Aicebo sets Hiker Benjamin on fire for having a geodude
<Tiel> JPGs with anti-aliased digital works, especially digital paintings are fine
<Tiel> They destroy pixel art, though
<Kjakings> 7oh, also, in Black and White, no pre-gen 5 Pokemon will be availible until after you've beaten the elite four.
<drf|laptop> 03JPG the format is fine
<Aicebo> GIGGLE GIGGLE MY NAMES BENJAMIN AND I LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC, THAT MAKES ME RANDOM!!!!!
<Kjakings> 7all brand new
<drf|laptop> 03but Paint just sucks at saving it
<drf|laptop> 03other programs can do it better
<Aicebo> cool
<Tiel> Exactly.
<TimeShift> depends on the version of Paint you're using
<Tiel> Photoshop can save it really well
<Ripred> ooooh im bored
<drf|laptop> 03No
<TimeShift> the Win7-Version of paint is quite good in fact
<drf|laptop> 03even the newest one fails
<Tiel> not really.
<drf|laptop> 03Nope
<drf|laptop> 03it's not
<Tiel> Win7 paint doesn't.
<drf|laptop> 03it's exactly the same as the older ones, all they did was change the default type ton PNG
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<drf|laptop> 03*to
<Tiel> Yeah xD
<Tiel> and make it shiny
<Tiel> and more confusing
<drf|laptop> 03also EW THE RIBON
<drf|laptop> 03*RIBBON
<drf|laptop> 03^ more confusing, yes
<drf|laptop> 03I got rid of it
<drf|laptop> 03and put in the Vista one
<Ripred> i dont like paint in general
<Tiel> Paint is good if you know how to use it.
<Tiel> annndddd I want to know how to do that
<Tiel> |D
<Ripred> i dont =\
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I like it for things such as print screen and paste
<Tiel> Oh yeah
<drf|laptop> 03why open up some superbloated program like Photoshop if Paint does the same thing just fine?
<Tiel> because photoshoop/Gimp takes forever to boot up
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Tiel> plus cropping is confusing in those programs
<drf|laptop> 03and the one cool thing about Paint
<Tiel> you can't just drag the canvas to enlarge/make it smaller
<Ripred> photoshop is so confusing
<drf|laptop> 03it automatically adjusts the canvas size
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Tiel> Also, you can make anti-aliased lines in Win7 paint
<Tiel> xD
<Ripred> paint is better for cropping and resixing
<drf|laptop> 03EW WINDOWS 7 PAINT
<Ripred> resizing
<drf|laptop> 03um
<drf|laptop> 03Paint cannot resize
<Ripred> gah cant spell
<drf|laptop> 03only crop
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Quanyails> 7Lag gone again.
<Tiel> It can
<Quanyails> 7Without quality loss, that is.
<Tiel> sort of
<Tiel> it can do it, but in a very crappy fashion
<drf|laptop> 03how?
<Quanyails> 7Right click, stretch/skew.
<Tiel> stretch/skew
<drf|laptop> 03If you change the size of the camvas
<drf|laptop> 03*canvas
<Quanyails> 7Type in the percentage.
<drf|laptop> 03that's cropping
<Espeon> lol
<drf|laptop> 03........
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03that uses Nearest Neighbor
<drf|laptop> 03EW NEAREST NEIGHBOR
<Espeon> that really kills the quality
<Quanyails> 7Or the control +/-
<Tiel> Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03You know what I use to resize?
<drf|laptop> 03MS Photo Editor. Included in Office 2000.
<Quanyails> 7What?
<drf|laptop> 03Works awesome XD
<Ripred> ooooh i hate chatting on my phone
<Tiel> enlarging anything is hard to do without quality loss
<drf|laptop> 03well duh
<drf|laptop> 03EW UPSCALING
<Quanyails> 7Except vectors.
<drf|laptop> 03vectors don't count

<drf|laptop> 03if you have a PNG, jPG, whatever, I don't care if it was *made* as vectors, it will be lossy if you try to upscale it.;
<Tiel> yeah
<TimeShift> and something more: http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Workshop/C-Nail-Screw.gif
<Tiel> actually Quicktime isn't horrible
<Tiel> for playing videos
<Tiel> when I'm too lazy to boot up VLC or whatever
<TimeShift> correct Tier - it's an ENTIRE DESASTER to play ANYTHING with it....
<drf|laptop> 03EW QUICKTIME
<drf|laptop> 03just use Media Player Classic
<TimeShift> I mean - a media player needing even MORE resources than Windows Media Player?
<Tiel> I don't use it as my primary one xD
<drf|laptop> 03Use MPC.
<Tiel> I use WinAmp for everything
<drf|laptop> 03As your primary, secondary, and teridary
<Tiel> except DVDs
<drf|laptop> 03WTF WINAMP
<drf|laptop> 03Winamp is an AUDIO player
<drf|laptop> 03it's not for videos
<Tiel> Nah.
<TimeShift> it can also play videos drf...
<Tiel> It plays videos fairly well.
<TimeShift> ...lame enough
<Ripredx> oooh i hate clones
<Quanyails> 7Wanna ask someone here to kill it?

<TimeShift> we have chat rules here
<drf|laptop> 03*FAIL
<Quanyails> 7That's just the info box, Ripred.
<TimeShift> and those chat rules are to be applied
<TimeShift> enfore them - or leave
<Quanyails> 7Does it say we can't do whatever that person did?
<drf|laptop> 03Show me the rule that bans filesharing?
<drf|laptop> 03Hmm?
<drf|laptop> 03Because AFAIK there is none.
<drf|laptop> 03Stop making up rules as I said.
<TimeShift> we have

<Ripred> 2i drew a picture of lugia :D you all should go make fun of it .-.
<TimeShift> and you start reading
<Quanyails> 7I don't see it, TimeShift.
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
<drf|laptop> 03There is NO RULE sayin gyou can't have file servers.
<drf|laptop> 03-g
<Ripred> 2lol
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> :D
<drf|laptop> 03and his file server only shows if you type !list
<Ripred> 2served
<drf|laptop> 03That qualifies as a ! command and those are alloewd
<Ripred> 2!list
<drf|laptop> 03*allowed
<drf|laptop> 03so as i said, don't abuse power.
<Icydragon> Hi...
<Icydragon> I'm cooking right now, gotta feed these kids....
<Ripred> 2hm
<Ripred> 2i dont understand this time differance
<Quanyails> 7'alo, Time?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh ok
<Ripred> 2not only am i in america eastern but i also dont understand the 24 hour time thingy
<Aristeo> :o
<Tiel> I don't see a single rule in reference to filesharing
<drf|laptop> 03that's because there isn't one
<Quanyails> 7What's the question, Ripred?
<drf|laptop> 03and what 24 hour time?
<drf|laptop> 03you mean like 16:00?
<Ripred> 2yeeees
<Ripred> 2i hate that
<Ripred> 2it confuses me
<Tiel> it's simple
<Quanyails> 7Subtract 12.
<drf|laptop> 03just subtract 12
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Quanyails> 7And attach a PM.
<Tiel> and makes helluva more sense than A.M. and P.M. imo XD
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Ripred> 2but im still in a different time zone
<Espeon> In Norway there is no am/pm so lolz
<Ripred> 2and im notsure of the differance
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03what time zone are you in Ripred?
<TimeShift> http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
<drf|laptop> 03GMT +/- what
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, I read that
<Icydragon> Okay, back...
<Ripred> 2eastern somthing
<Ripred> 2@_@
<Espeon> LOOOOOOL
<drf|laptop> 03WTF?
<Espeon> HAHAHA
<drf|laptop> 03Stop making up rules
<Ripred> 2xD
<Espeon> that wasn't there 2 minutes ago TimeShift
<Quanyails> 7:|
<Tiel> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I'll need to run this by Articuno >_>
<Tiel> that wasn't there
<Tiel> ever
<Tiel> until now
<Tiel> xD
<Quanyails> 7Do realize I don't find this funny.
<drf|laptop> 03Just because you don't like file servers doesn't mean you can single handedly just create your own rule to prevent it.
<Espeon> Okay this is just silly <-<
<drf|laptop> 03I realize that you have site admin permissions but you can't just do that without talking to the othper staff first
<drf|laptop> 03-p
<TimeShift> this channel is not for filesharing, was never and will never
<drf|laptop> 03and you're the ONLY ONE who has an issue with it.
<Ripred> 2poooower abbbuser
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, having a file server is different than only using a channel to share files...
<TimeShift> maybe I'm the only one not wanting a lawsuit against Arti and Xai?
<drf|laptop> 03he actually talks on here
<drf|laptop> 03and I've DCC sent stuff to others before, including Arti
<drf|laptop> 03so that's a retarded rule.
<TimeShift> well, he should decide
<drf|laptop> 03TimeShift, you don't know how fservs work, do you?
<Ripred> 2why would a lawsuit happen against arti and xai
<Ripred> 2...
<drf|laptop> 03You can't just turn them off for a single channel
<drf|laptop> 03it's either on or off
<TimeShift> this rule is not negotiable
<drf|laptop> 03and this isn't the only place he goes on
<drf|laptop> 03Until I report you to Articuno for abuse, at least.
<Ripred> 2im going to side with timeshift because he has the POWAH
*Quanyails 7blinks
<Tiel> just because someone has power doesn't mean that they are always in the right.
<Quanyails> 7I trust DRF on this. o3o
<Ripred> 2yah but
<Tiel> Same.
<Quanyails> 7-o3o
<Quanyails> 7:3
<drf|laptop> 03also keep in mind that !list is a ! command and under rule 34 it's allowed

<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Lugia365> what the?
<Ripred> 2this game makes no sence
<Ripred> 2D:<
<Quanyails> 7If you want, type a swear word in there.
<Stormy> I would probably rather be anorexic than obese
<Quanyails> 7It has responses to that. :P
<Lugia365> eat
<Lugia365> ...
<Lambda> I wouldn't
<Stormy> It's easier to gain weight than it is to lose it
*Espeon holds them o3o
<Quanyails> 7The reply differs depending on if it's a harsh or not-harsh word.
<Lambda> I'd rather be full all the time than choose to be starving
<Lugia365> was that a script?
<Ripred> 2i dont belong with the adventurers :(
<Kjakings> 7that's not how fat people work
<Lambda> well true
<Kjakings> 7the more you eat, the more you want to eat
<Quanyails> 7It's not the adventure; it's the ending. :3
<Lambda> also true
<Lambda> but the reverse tends to be true for anorexics
<Stormy> fat people are hungry all the time because they're constantly getting fatter and need more food
<Quanyails> 7Examining southeast is weird.
<Quanyails> 7Typing 'up' less so.
<Lambda> the skinnier you get it still isn't good enough for anorexic people
<Ripred> 2this game is....THE GAME

<Quanyails> 7Now I can use it for actual purposes.
<drfsupercenter> 03I had it ignore Kyu for several months for doing that
<Ripred> 2how do you kill it?
<Lugia365> LOL
*Espeon yawns for real
<Espeon> nini
<Quanyails> 7DRF, considering TimeShift's behavior...
<TimeShift> still, I'm happy being one of the few knowing about the world's longest ROTFL-acronym
<Ripred> !define KILL
<[TST]Bot> -!- cause to die; put to death, usually intentionally or knowingly; "This man killed several people when he tried to rob a bank"; "The farmer killed a pig for the holidays"
<drfsupercenter> 03Ripred, no
<drfsupercenter> 03you already DID kill it
<Lugia365> lol
<Ripred> 2HOW
<drfsupercenter> 03no defining acronyms you KNOW define swearintg
<drfsupercenter> 03*contain
<Ripred> 2xD
<Aristeo> So, basically, if you're in danger of physical harm, you can shoot to kill, if they come in your house, you can shoot to kill, and if they try to rob or steal something, you can only shoot their legs out from under them
<drfsupercenter> 03seriously, doing that is just idiotic
<drfsupercenter> 03you already know what WTF stands for
<drfsupercenter> 03so don't try to !define it
<Lugia365> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm serious
<Espeon> it was funny the first time you gotta admit that
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how much of a pain it is to keep fixing it?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah
<Ripred> 2i was sure that it wouldt know what omgwtfbbq was
<Lugia365> I know
<drfsupercenter> 03the first time it was
<tricky> Huh, interesting...
<Espeon> Yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but after that then it got stupid
<Espeon> which makes it unfunny now
<Espeon> :3

<Quanyails> 7TimeShift has no refute. Great.
<Ripred> 2timeshift did it the second time
<Lugia365> lol
<TimeShift> did what?
<Ripred> 2by repeating wht i said
<Ripred> 2and THAT killed itthe second time
<drfsupercenter> 03no, he tried to define a stupidly huge acronym

<Lugia365> 3:40
<drfsupercenter> 03TimeShift, I never said you were

<Ripred> 2i need to get to 5500 mssges so once everyone leaves im going to talkto myslf for3 hours :D
<TimeShift> wonder when I'll be blamed the next time if the bot disappears...

<Creideiki> Any one here ever play a pen-and-paper RPG?
<Quanyails> 7Or should we start from scratch?
<Arcanine> 04so Tiel
<Tiel> I'm just myself in roleplays when I don't feel like being an actual character
<Tiel> Meeeeeee
<Arcanine> 04when you click start playing
<Arcanine> 04you are brought to a server list

<Tiel> LOL
<Theguesst> Just sharing a bit on my own experience
<Ripred> 2he wanted to keep me as one of him
<Quanyails> 7So... Y'wanna be a Lugia? :P

<drfsupercenter> 03we have too many Lugias
<Tiel> Yes.
<Tiel> |D
<Light_Lati> lolz
<Quanyails> 7But not too sueish?
<Creideiki> I can't draw my character, or anything (other than things technical) to save my life. :P (However, there is more to artistry than just the visual arts.)
<Theguesst> So what?
<Light_Lati> eesh
<Light_Lati> so many Lugias
<Theguesst> What are you, crei
<Ripred> 2i want to be different

<Ripred> 2you know?
<Light_Lati> yet more balls are thrown at ME
*Light_Lati hides
<Creideiki> Look up my character's name sake. :P
<Creideiki> :s/name sake/namesake
<Quanyails> 7First of all; person or pokemon? (Or something else?)
<Ripred> 2not person
<Ripred> 2im pretty sure pokemon
<Ripred> 2mabey not avredge pokemon
<Ripred> 2but still considered a pokemon
<Quanyails> 7Any types or animal-bases you'd like to base it on?

<Ripred> 2xd
<Ripred> 2xD
<Ripred> 2suppose your right
<Theguesst> Rip, if I may point out this exert from arti... Articuno Dislikes Smoking, excessive drinking, drugs, cruelty to animals, liars, chavs, overly religious people, shopping, RSI, stereotypical furry behaviour and the fandom itself, ignorance.

<Ripred> 2articuno calls herself....an ARTICUNO
<Tiel> yeah
<Tiel> x
<Tiel> *xD
<Theguesst> Yes
<Quanyails> 7What bats are there in pokemon?
<Creideiki> (If any one is too lazy to go and look up whom my character is based upon, I can provide a drawing made by a very good artist.)
<Theguesst> With the fandom, it's something else
<Quanyails> 7Or would you consider something more demonic, less batty?
<Theguesst> It's worse
<Ripred> 2zubat but i HATE tht pokemon
<Theguesst> IMO
<Theguesst> I'll leave it at that and you can ask her tomorrow
<Theguesst> Later
<Quanyails> 7Gliscor?

<Creideiki> It may be because I'm a university student but: Why did that just sound WRONG?
<Ripred> 2would it b possible to incoporate bat wings with him without making it look stupid?
<Ripred> 2ooo i like giratina

<Ripred> 2im not even sure what a furry is
<Ripred> 2i havean idea
<Quanyails> 7Okay, so you're not.
<Creideiki> (Points Out: I happen to be a furry.)
<Tiel> you join into the game
<Tiel> in the respawn room
<Quanyails> 7You won't have to worry about theguesst.
<Tiel> just run out and start shooting guys that aren't your color
<Ripred> 2i know there animals with humanistic features
<drfsupercenter> 03EW FURRIES
<Ripred> 2but im not familure with the fandom
<Ripred> 2nor do i see much a difference between this and that
<Creideiki> Ripred: Unless you're really interested in finding out more... stay away; stay far, far, far away.

<Arcanine> 04you can create your own server
<Tiel> you can
<Tiel> but it's difficult
<Tiel> and confusing
<Tiel> and I think you need to do some port forwarding shiz
<Creideiki> My DSL upload speed is so blah.
<Arcanine> 04i see
<Arcanine> 04how many different maps are there
<Arcanine> 04i think i'm counting 10

*Light_Lati hides
<Creideiki> Harpsichords are NOT a combination of a piano and a guitar.
<Ripred> 2you hide alo
<Ripred> 2its piano
<Ripred> 2.....tats plucked
<Creideiki> I personally think that is the worst way to describe it.
<Ripred> 2thats*
<Creideiki> Especially to an actual harpsichordist.
<Ripred> 2its a piano but it plucks the strings like a guitar D:
<Creideiki> And especially to someone who knows it was invented BEFORE the piano.
<Ripred> 2hay hay hay i kow that D:
<Creideiki> So infact the piano is a harpsichord that hits the strings instead of plucking them.
<Ripred> 2im taking piano classes
*Glacymr hugs Obsi back
<Ripred> 2i know what a piano is and i know whata harpsichord D:
<Ripred> 2is*

<Monferno> I suck at graphics
<Armageddon> 02Ah
<Armageddon> 02Well as long as you know how to program it
<Armageddon> 02and avoid bugs and security holes
<Armageddon> 02It should be fine
<Monferno> Hopefully I will.
<Monferno> Let's just hope that the lient has JavaScript
<Armageddon> 02Uh
<Armageddon> 02You mean the client's browser supports JS?

<Proto> hi where
<where> Hey Prince-dari
<where> Uh
<where> Proto
<where> >.>
<Proto> ...
<where> me beats his tab key savagely
<where> Uh
<Proto> ...
*where does that
<where> as in, /me instead of me'
<where> >.>
<where> <.<
<Curly> nice, where xD
<where> :/
<where> Shouldn't you be in bed, Curly?
<where> :o
<Curly> I'm um... acclimatizing my body for my shifts
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<where> It's either way past bedtime, or nowhere near getting up time.
<where> I see.
<Curly> well, it's 5:47am, so that's not thaaat early
<where> :|
*where forces Curly into bed
*Proto hits where
<where> wat
<where> It;s for her own good :O
<where> You'll never get to sleep once the mean sun comes up[
<where> and all the birds start going on about how lovely the new day is
<Curly> I have things to do today :X
<where> D:
*where pew pews the mean things
*Curly is going to apply for health insurance and go get her uniform and go pass resumes out
<Proto> :o
<Proto> Busy busy busy
<where> :O
<where> Very busy.
<Proto> I don't like the sound my 360 is making with this cracked disk in it
<Proto> :(
<Curly> why are you trying to run a cracked disk? O_o
<Proto> Because it's my only copy of modern warfare
<where> Consoles don't spin them very fast
<where> compared to PCs
<Proto> where, I know
<Proto> But it's got two noticeable cracks in it
<Curly> does that disk even work? >.>
<Proto> Yes
<Proto> I should have taken it back when I first got it
<where> My copy of Halo is like that, still si fine.
<where> 360 not explodeded.
<Curly> when I get a proper job I'm going to buy a PS3 and a 360 and a ton of games :X
<where> You mean a PC Dx
<Proto> that's it
<Curly> I'm buying a good gaming PC too
*Proto turns it off
<where> yay
<Curly> but there are console exclusives like 3d dot heroes!
<Curly> which I really want
<where> What is that?
<where> But at any rate
<Curly> one second
<Proto> was making a *dunkita dunkita dunkita* sound
<where> >Console exclusive
<where> >really want
<where> wat
<Proto> Means it's only available on one console
<Curly> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL3qVfemEp4
<Curly> come on, you can't not want that!
<where> Hm.
<where> Actually looks okay
<Proto> I want it
<Proto> But can't afford a ps3 :(
<where> Despite looking at 3 seconds ofit
<Curly> I want Blazblue and Geometry Wars too among other random things
*Proto went outof map in MW2
*Proto enjoyed that
<Proto> >_>
<Curly> no clip ^^
<Curly> I like how bullets actually push you back in the modern warfare (call of duty in general?) series
<Proto> I know someone that doesn't like games like MW
<Proto> because of how realistic the damage thing is
<Proto> and how easy you die on veteran
<Curly> why are they playing on veteran then? >.>
<Curly> if you play on recruit it's easy
<Proto> er, in general
<where> MW is way harder than MW2
<Proto> yeah
<where> :o
<Curly> MW2 had a harder veteran mode I think
<where> On vet B)
<Proto> I can actually not suck in MW2
<where> Not for me.
<Curly> all I know is I can't remember dying so fast from just gunfire in MW
*Proto remembers when he had a lot of video games that were current
<Curly> I've never had a lot of video games that are current :D
<Proto> I think the most current game I have is l4d2
<Proto> this is back before my original xbox got stolen
<Curly> what about Alien Swarm? :O
<Curly> you can't not have Alien Swarm
<Proto> I don't have alien swarm
<Curly> it's free :O
<Proto> On steam
<Proto> which runs not well
<Proto> on a netbook
<Proto> It didn't even know what kind of graphics 'card' the thing had
<Proto> lol
<Proto> which reminds me of something that will always make me laugh
<where> Off to bedtime now :o
<Proto> people's reactions when I tell them we didn't have a computer until 2009
<Proto> bye where
<where> O_o
<Curly> good night where o/
<Proto> yeah, something like that xD
<where> But that's like living in the pst, in the future, which is now in the past!
<where> \:O/
<Curly> I live in PST >.>
<where> wat
<Proto> couldn't afford one lol, so it was like living within your means
<Curly> Pacific Standard Time :D
<where> Is that a timezone?
<where> Ah.
<Proto> Nice one where
<Curly> GMT-8 ^^
<where> Nooo
<where> +10 ftw
<where> >:O
<Curly> I just like the province I live in <3
<where> Although it does result in me needing to be in bed now
<where> And leaving Proto and Curly behind Dx
<Proto> I'm used to being left behind
<Curly> bye o/
<Proto> seeya where
*where doesn't want to leave Proto behind Dx
<Proto> It's never bothered people before
*where forcibly cuddles Proto goodbye then runs away
<Proto> Don't touch me where

<Lucario> 12i'd really rather not talk about yesterday, arti can tell you everything and i'd rather she told you because i want you to hear it from her side as my version of events is inconsequential because of how she feels.
<Aurora> 6then go slice your tomato, put a bit of salt on it, and don't complain lol
<Cyndi> 10GAH

<SheenaFox> I'm not playing tennis today XD
<Glacymr> 12it can be seen as a mod
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6what I mean is that Kyu doesn't have a little thing on his profile status that says "RP Board Mod"
<Sky> ...

<Ripred> 2o3o
<Ripred> 2 4x-9=3-4x
<theguesst> I hate that smiley
<Ripred> 2what does x equal D:
<theguesst> Math?
<theguesst> simple
<Ripred> 2i hate summer HW T_T
<Ripred> 2and of corse i wait untill the last minut to do it
<ChinChilla> 14owo
<Aurora> 6lol summer homework
<Glacymr> 12okay Aurora
<Glacymr> 12i think everything is in order
<Aurora> 6glad college doesn't have that :>
<ChinChilla> 14 8x = 12?
<Aurora> 6 1.5
<theguesst> so x = 3
<theguesst> do the rest yourself
<Glacymr> 12Aurora want to get this over with now?
<theguesst> wait no
<theguesst> derp
<Aurora> 6sure one minute
<Ripred> 2wait what?
<theguesst> Derp de derp
<theguesst> herp
<ChinChilla> 14 12/8?
<Glacymr> 123009 0313 8675
<Ripred> 2dontyou add 4 to both sides so its 8x-9?
<theguesst> no\
<Ripred> 2soooo 8x-9=3
<AeroDracohem> oAo
<Ripred> 2why not D:
<ChinChilla> 14 4x, yes.
<ChinChilla> 14So 8x = 12, add 9 to both sides.
<Ripred> 2thenadd 9 to both sides
<Ripred> 2making 8x=12
<ChinChilla> 14Then divide by 8.
<theguesst> so yeah, 8x = 12
<Ripred> 2then dicide by 8
<Ripred> 2divide
<Ripred> 2xD
<theguesst> I don't think you need to divide
<theguesst> It's just simple algebra
<ChinChilla> 14Well, if you need to find X or not.
<Ripred> 2w.5
<Ripred> 2 1.5
<theguesst> I took it freshman HS yeah
<theguesst> year*
<Ripred> 2 1.5 is in the answr key @_@ so it must be right
<Aurora> 6I went straight to geometry my frosh year
<theguesst> :/
<Aurora> 6so much better than algebra
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<theguesst> I need to get back to school
<Ripred> 2i mis geopetry
<Ripred> 2geometry*
<Ripred> 2i hate algera
<Ripred> 2ALGEBRA*
<ChinChilla> 14One thing I don't get is the addition of logic. (No pun intended.)
<AeroDracohem> augh I'm going to be taking geometry with /all/ the freshmenppl regardless of math level .A.
<Aurora> 6aero, what
<Ripred> 2doesnt lati have her first day of school today?
<Glacymr> 12i got to leave to do a small task in 8 minutes
<Aurora> 6most freshmen take geometry
<Glacymr> 127
<Ripred> 2she said today was the first
<Aurora> 6so that's not anything weird
<AeroDracohem> yesh
<Aurora> 6small task?

<AeroDracohem> it annoys me so much. >A>;
<Aurora> 6how do I get my own FC?
<Ripred> 2i drew another lugia and posted it in the gallery. can you accept it? :3
<drf|work> Pal pad
<Aurora> 6Aero, if you went into the algebra class, it would be worse
<Aurora> 6trust me
<AeroDracohem> oAo
<Aurora> 6drf, yeah I know, but like....it says log onto nintendo wifi
<drf|work> shoudln't
<drf|work> wait
<drf|work> have you gotten a FC yet?
<drf|work> on that game?
<Ripred> 2Ganondrf
<Ripred> 2*giggle*
<Aurora> 6no
<drf|work> that's why
<drf|work> you have to connect to the internet to get one
<Aurora> 6well, for me that involves walking to the back of the house, but once I'm in range it'll connect?
<drf|work> yes
<Aurora> 6*it'll connect the code
<Aurora> 6I know how to get onto Wifi
<Glacymr> 12you have to log into nintendo wifi to get the FC assigned to you
<Aurora> 6I just don't remember getting on wifi for the code lololol
<Aurora> 6k
<Ripred> 2Aurora
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Aurora> 6k brb

<drf|work> they only work on XP or Vistrash
<Glacymr> 12who cares?
<drf|work> since I use Windows 7 it doesn't work
<drf|work> so I gave mine away
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<drf|work> dude, trust me
<drf|work> it's cheaper to just get a router
<drf|work> you can get a router for $30
<Glacymr> 12so?
<drf|work> those Wi-Fi adapters are like $35
<drf|work> so yeah
<drf|work> routers work with everything

<drf|work> then write "this problem is invalid" LOL
<drf|work> or that

<Ripred> 2no
<Glacymr> 12i remember in class once
<Ripred> 2no other ones can be invalad
<Ripred> 2there is only one space for a fail problem
<Glacymr> 12our teacher gave us a whole bunch of no solution problems on purpose
<Aurora> 6but they can be invalid?

<Ripred> 2go drf go :D
*Stitch has a REALLY crappy video card.
<drf|work> um
<drf|work> also
<drf|work> that's not 3 variables
<Glacymr> 12you know you should be doing this
<Stitch> Even the official website doesn't have drivers for it anymore. XD
<Spyrorocks> :(
<drf|work> 3 variables is like x+y+z=4
<Ripred> 2not that one
<drf|work> anyway let's see
*Stitch had to google it.
<Ripred> 2i got the one with 3 variables
<drf|work> -8=3x-11
<Stitch> But it'll work, I guess.
<Stitch> If it ran CSS it can run this.
<drf|work> 3x=3
<drf|work> x=1

<Ripred> 2LOL
<Ripred> 2this wont be easy
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: then why are you here? lol
<Ripred> 2im trying to find the slope and y intercept from a graph
<nintendofreak> lol
<Cyndi> 10WHOS MA MAID OF HONOUR?
<ChinChilla> 14That's not easy? Owo
<Ripred> 2i can draw the graph using text :D
<Icydragon> >.>
<ChinChilla> 14Do you have the equation?
<Ripred> 2i hate maths D:<
<Ripred> 2its a bunch o lines
<Icydragon> Nintendofreak....
<Ripred> 2no equation
<nintendofreak> >.> im a guy
<Cyndi> 10nintendo is a guy
<Icydragon> I know...
<ChinChilla> 14Okay, the slope is easy: Find two points where the line intersects the grid.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> urgh
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> not again
<Cyndi> 10he's not gay either
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i keep dying
<Cyndi> 10on what level?
<Icydragon> Oh.
<Cyndi> 10i can give tips
<ChinChilla> 14Preferably at an intersection.
<ChinChilla> 14Or in other words, find two places where three lines meet.
<Ripred> 2 0,0and 2,1
<Icydragon> Baby....
<ChinChilla> 14Okay, subtract the X and Y of one from the other X Y.
<nintendofreak> lol ya play that game a lot should be able to blast through it without dieing now especially with maxed upgrades
<ChinChilla> 14In this case, 2 - 0 and 1 - 0.
<Cyndi> 10yeah
<ChinChilla> 14Divide Y by X.
<Cyndi> 10Icy: what is it sexy?
<Damos> okay um the application is more of a game
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it's skabb
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> second time around
<nintendofreak> >.> earth flail spam attack
<Damos> non of those are it
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> tried
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> died
<Cyndi> 10spam?
<Cyndi> 10lolWTF
<Icydragon> Justin_Long_Fanatic: How many times have you replayed that game?
<ChinChilla> 14Damos, the application DRF linked?
<Ripred> 2um
<nintendofreak> ok ... dragon time then ram him with it without mashing the button
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> finally
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> now i kill him
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> jesus
<Ripred> 2lets use 2,1 and 4,2
<Ripred> 2so i can see the numbers
<Cyndi> 10HALLEXHAM
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> next time i'm using dark spyro
<Damos> DRF linked?
<ChinChilla> 14Okay. In (2, 1), you know which number is X, and which one is Y, right?
<Cyndi> 10yeah
<Ripred> 2what would be it?
<Cyndi> 10thats always best
<Ripred> 2yah
<Ripred> 2x is first
<ChinChilla> 14Okay. So subtract one x by the other.
<ChinChilla> 14And subtract one y by the other.
<nintendofreak> dark spyro = me killing him before even activating the battle cutscene before the fight
<Cyndi> 10god
<Ripred> 2so 4-2 and 2-1?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> see i used regular spyro
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> who sucks

<ChinChilla> 14Altogether:
<Cyndi> 10i think one might be planning to do me#
<Damos> if It helps any this was on a laptop call Averatec
<Cyndi> 10ehh

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> woah
<Ripred> 2ok
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> da da da da damn
<Damos> are you doing equations
<ChinChilla> 14So what's 1 divided by 2?

<Damos> were it (x1 - x2)=m(x1-x2)
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> like the stick figures on crack
<Ripred> 2so the slope is .5
<Cyndi> 10OMG
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they say da da da da damn

<Icydragon> >.>
<Ripred> 2the*
<Ripred> 2yah

<ChinChilla> 14Is it the other way...
<ChinChilla> !define y-intercept

<Cyndi> 10CYNDI
<ChinChilla> 14Technically, there can be a coefficient before y.
<darkshadow> DDQ
<ChinChilla> 14In this case, 2.
<Cyndi> 10YOU WEIRDO
<Ripred> 2so slope is 1.5?
<Aurora> 6she got on my case about doing that, saying she had it organized exactly as she wanted it
<darkshadow> DDQ
<Aurora> 6i'm like >_>

<Ripred> 2corse it does
<Aurora> 6sigh
<Aurora> 6I'm not going to comment to that

<Ripred> 2just like murder
<Espeon> I gotta agree though - hiding behind "freedom of speech" too much = pathetic. You gotta be able to back up your thoughts and beliefs.
<spyro-legend> how do u get pikachu on a bus???
<TimeShift> what about this rule: "Your personal freedom ends where you hurt the freedom of another being"
<Cyndi> 10I wanna be the very best like no one ever was.
<Articuno> 12I just think people shouldn't say offensive things, really
<Cyndi> 10to capture them is my real test

<Cyndi> 10to train them is mah cause
<spyro-legend> shut up with the song!

<Articuno> 12There's no "need" to say what you really think at times
<Ripred> 2just because you can doesnt mean you SHOULD
<Cyndi> 10searchin far and wide
<ChinChilla> 14Don't we have a rule for such things?
<spyro-legend> god damit
<Cyndi> 10and so on
<Espeon> True, sometimes you should just assess the situation and stfu :3
<spyro-legend> shhhhhh
*Espeon dies
<spyro-legend> good
<Articuno> 12I don't see why people have to force their opinions on people, not everyone wants to hear it
<Cyndi> 10your just lucky i dont know the whole song
<ChinChilla> 14 37. Religious and political chat is now forbidden due to people not being able to control their emotions. Many users have been insulted and flamed for their beliefs, time to put a stop to this. Make a seperate channel if you wish to debate.
<Articuno> 12Lol well said
<spyro-legend> i do
<spyro-legend> ha
<Espeon> UGH forcing opinions on people
<Articuno> 12Yeh there's that ChinChilla

<drfsupercenter> 03anyway bbl dinner
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it's good
<Feather> 10k
<theguesst> The systems like to use cheap sound cards
<Icy> I've heard of it... *adds to list of movies to see*
<theguesst> Also, did you know that the SNES uses a sound chip developed by sony
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it's a scary movie
<Feather> 10bbl aswell
<theguesst> kk
<theguesst> so here I am
<theguesst> all alone
<Icy> hmm...
<theguesst> without
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> it's about this group of ppl who go to a Mayan pyramid
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> but they realize something's going on
<Icy> SUSPENCE!!!1110ne!!!
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> unfortunately one of the characters is a whiny bitch
<Damos> 13backy
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> in the movie
<theguesst> kk
<Icy> I know, I saw the trailer...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh ok
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> u know what chick?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> Amy
<theguesst> So what were you asking drf about earlier that involved the PMD manga?
<Icy> Lemme guess, she and her boyfreind survives while everyone else is picked off one by one?
<Damos> 13huh?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> no
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> only she survives
<Damos> 13it was just a joke
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> which is dumb
<theguesst> oh
<Icy> Of course.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> cause she's the worst character
<Icy> It's always the whiney catious one...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yep
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> one interesting thing
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> there's an alternate ending
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> where they show the deadly vine in her
<Icy> Where she dies? ;D
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yeah cause of the vine
<Icy> Yaaaay!
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i know
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i loved the alternate ending
<Armageddon> wait
<Kirara> 04bait
<Armageddon> lol, Damos, you had me fooled for an instance there
<Armageddon> and why the hell am I using CGI:IRC on firefox
<Damos> LOL

<Icy> Evil?
<Kirara> 04you should of used green text
<Kirara> 04would of made it more convincing

<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *gammas
<Damos> imagine if the real drf joined
<Kirara> 04even thought she found out before you could talk
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> they're cheating in the X games
<Armageddon> It's not exactly funny, Damos
<Damos> 3there
<Armageddon> Just be warned
<Icy> I know, I saw it before.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh ok
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate cheaters
<Damos> 13what?
<Armageddon> There's someone in here who's leaking information to Articuno about what goes on
<Armageddon> There's someone in here who's leaking information to Articuno about what goes on
<Icy> Me too...
<Quilava> why does that matter?
<Armageddon> dskfajsdhfjksdfs
<SuperiorSwampert> 12lolwut?
<Damos> 13You know I wouldn't do that
<Armageddon> doesn't really matter
<Armageddon> but if you want to keep your 'reputation' in TST
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yay goofy's gonna help!
<Armageddon> you should be careful
<Damos> 13I even forgot what happened yesterday
<Armageddon> I'm pretty sure that 99% of the people here don't give a <censored>
<Quilava> I never had a reputation there
<Icy> ;D
<Quilava> I was just 'that one guy'
<Armageddon> And my rep there is basically as a troll, outcast and <censored>
<Damos> 13why
<Damos> 13what happened with you
<Damos> 13and TST
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> goofy rocks
<Quilava> I was even told nobody would miss me if I left. so I did
<Kirara> 04pfft i don't get good hands with this deck
<Armageddon> o.o
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> There's that one topic in somewhere
<Armageddon> cbb to find it
<Armageddon> And Quilava, we'd prolly miss you and your constant sex jokes here >:3
*Armageddon hides
<Quilava> lawl
*Nightshadow snuggles
<Icy> I like him in kingdomhearts, I haven't played any of those games in a while...
<Quilava> they would be more 'constant' if I remembered that IRC existed most of the time
<Nightshadow> XD
<Damos> 13!espeon
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh
*Icy pokes Justin_Long_Fanatic.
<Quilava> but no really, my memory is that bad :(
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i hate the gammas

<Icy> Gamma's are dicks ;D
<Damos> 13!espeon
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> buncha cheats
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> that's illegal in college
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i know
<Quilava> I can only focus on one thing at a time, and everything else is pretty much nonexistant to me
<Quilava> which is one of the reasons I suck so bad at gaming :|
<Damos> 13!sneas
<Armageddon> :|
*Sneas now belongs to Damos for 9 minutes
<Articuno> 12XD

<Sneas> 03o.o
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6quick question
<Icy> Punk ass decepticon.
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i love pete's son
<Aurora> 6left or right?
<Aurora> 6ffffff
<Articuno> 12left
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> lol
<Aurora> 6well
<Aurora> 6I did that
<Aurora> 6raikou went right D:
<drfsupercenter> 03<theguesst> The systems like to use cheap sound cards <- well, see, I know when you try to play Sonic on an emulator, a lot of times the sound will be screwed up
<drfsupercenter> 03because of something
<Articuno> 12What are you on about?
<Aurora> 6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<drfsupercenter> 03but I have never heard that in *legit* cartridges
<Aurora> 6I went right this time, he went left
<drfsupercenter> 03This console is actually licensed by Sega
<Quilava> so uh
<Quilava> hi.
<Articuno> 12?
<Icy> Now I'm watching transformers...
<Articuno> 12What are you playing?
<Aurora> 6soul silver
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6lol
<theguesst> I meant the consoles
<theguesst> I thought you bought aa famiclone
<Articuno> 12what bit?
<Articuno> 12OHHHHH'
<Articuno> 12YOU'RE CHASING IT
<Aurora> 6beaten all 16 gyms, just tracking entei and raikou
<Aurora> 6...
<Articuno> 12I THOUGHT YOU WERE PLAYING WITH IT XD
<Aurora> 6yes D:
<Aurora> 6....LOOOOOOOL
<Aurora> 6I wish D:
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> oh cool
<Articuno> 12Yeh I think the tracking system is crap for HGSS, why didnt they stick to teh DPPt version??
<Aurora> 6...?
<Aurora> 6what do you mean?
<Articuno> 12well in DPPt you can actually keep the map open so you dont have to open it every single time you want to see the position!
<Aurora> 6what was different in the DPPt?
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6but it's not that bad
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> i'm watching taking of pelham 124
<Articuno> 12aaaand
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> *123
<Articuno> 12Yeh it is
<drfsupercenter> 03<theguesst> I thought you bought aa famiclone <- no
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought a RetroGEN
<Aurora> 6in GSC/RSE you had to check the actual pokedex
<drfsupercenter> 03Which is some Chinese thing that was licensed by Sega
<Articuno> 12The Pokeymans are randomly moving rather than moving away from you all the time
<Articuno> 12Yeh it's stupid
<Aurora> 6they're never moving away from you o-o
<Aurora> 6they have a pattern
<Aurora> 6you just have to intercept |D
<Articuno> 12Yes the pattern is that if you move towards, they move away
<theguesst> Thats the exact definition
<theguesst> !google famiclone
<Articuno> 12You rarely ever collide paths
<Aurora> 6not exactly
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> one thing i like about hannah montana is amber and ashley are gone
<theguesst> >_<
<Aurora> 6they have defined paths
<Articuno> 12You can only move back and forward and so does the Pokemon
<Aurora> 6that reset every once in a while, or if you fly
<theguesst> I know it's licensed but those things hardly even get looked at these days
<Aurora> 6yeah, and quite often they're move towards you
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Articuno> 12Yes but they still follow the same pattern, like two piece chess
<drfsupercenter> 03Famiclone sounds like Famicom?
<theguesst> and I was refering to the sound chip being chep in that
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talking Sega, not Nintendo
<Aurora> 6which is why you fly again
<Quanyails> 7Chess, eh?
<Quanyails> 7Chess implies AI?
<Articuno> 12They can move towards you if you are more than 2 places from them :|
<Aurora> 6fly to mahogany, check map, fly if they're not near, repeat
<Articuno> 12and flying puts them in random places
<theguesst> The term is coined to aftermarket consoles
<Articuno> 12So are you saying that you fly each time rather than walk?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Aurora> 6arti, I've had them run into me
<Articuno> 12Thats gotta be SO annoying
<Aurora> 6arti yes
<Aurora> 6I fly to mahogany
<drfsupercenter> 03!define RetroGen
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> !define RetroGen
<[TST]Bot> -!- No results found
<Aurora> 6and fly to mahogany from mahogany
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Articuno> 12I always do it by route borders
<Aurora> 6it's annoying, but it works betetr than whatever you're suggesting lol
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Soyuz> Armageddon;
<Soyuz> "Warning. Warning. Airlock open. Throw the alien out, and shut? the bloody door"
<Articuno> 12Ok I'll try that D:
<Armageddon> o.o
<Aurora> 6if you're just walking between routes
<Aurora> 6yeah, you'll never catch them
<theguesst> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_hardware_clone
<Armageddon> I posted last night, Soyuz
<Icy> It's weird that the autobots kill two decepticons, that were only hiding.
<Icy> That's good movie.
<Soyuz> Cronker Live and reloaded/ Bad Fur Day reference
<Quilava> I'm bored :|
<Aurora> 6I was pro at tracking latios/latias in RSE
<Articuno> 12I sit on the borders and walk back and forth until they move enough for me to collide with them at one route change
<Articuno> 12It's complicated..
<Aurora> 6I purposely just ran into them and let them run just to track again
<Icy> Who are they?
<Aurora> 6arti, that stupid XD
<Creideiki> Hello peoples
<Damos> 13backy
<Damos> 13backy
<Aurora> 6flying resets their trail faster
<Articuno> 12Well it's no wonder it took me two weeks to catch Raikou and entei in Crystal
<Aeroslash> hi all
<Aurora> 6and it's easier to collide
<Aurora> 6LOOOL
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Articuno> 12I just found opening the fly menu was too much annoyingness
<Aurora> 6like saturday night, I ran into entei 5 times, raikou 3, and latios 6
<Articuno> 12Ok
<Aurora> 6my only problem is I need to paralyze them still D:
<Damos> 13KABOOOM
<Articuno> 12I use sleeps
<Articuno> 12But my Victreebel is over level 43 now I think so I can't use repel anymore..
<Quanyails> 7How about Shadow Tag?
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6well
<Damos> 13how do you play?
<Aurora> 6once you'e got them on your map
<Aurora> 6why do you use repels anyways?
<Aurora> 6I mean, you'll still run into them
<Quanyails> 7But without running into weaker other wild pokemon first.
<Armageddon> lolwb
<Aurora> 6and?
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the girls who pick on miley and lilly
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> the black and asian chick
<Aurora> 6so you run into a pidgey first
<Aurora> 6you'll find them after
<Armageddon> So, Damos
<Aurora> 6its not like they run after the first wild pokemon match
<Articuno> 12Guys?
<Icy> Ahh...
<Armageddon> Why are you here again? xD
<Aurora> 6meh?
<Articuno> 12TimeShift DELETED his account

<Quanyails> 7O.o

<Quanyails> 7Eh?
<Articuno> 12Nope thats not a glitch
<Armageddon> I mean, you're usually on TST, I rarely ever see you here
<Skylands> 10Yeah, he deleted it
<theguesst> I saw what happened earlier
<Damos> 13don't look at me I didn't do it
<Skylands> 10"Guest"
<Aurora> 6that's going a little
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6childish
<Soyuz> Armageddon; maybe because TST had a big <censored> storm :P
<Articuno> 12FFS
<Aurora> 6um
<Skylands> 10Eh, he did it once before, with the competition thing
<Articuno> 12I'm seriously annoyed
<Quanyails> 7So he got demoted and quit?
<Aurora> 6it's not like we didn't need him....now what
<Articuno> 12Yeh but he never deleted his entire account
<theguesst> DDDDDDD:
<Articuno> 12Quan no, his position altered slightly
<Articuno> 12He was still an admin
<Damos> 13well I actually forgot the name of this site and I didn't do anything about it T_T
<Armageddon> Lol, really?
<Articuno> 12Also before I even changed anything I asked him first, he didn't reply then quit.
<Damos> 13so that means he not an admin no more?
<Damos> 13true
<Articuno> 12Well how can he be if he deleted his account?
<Articuno> 12this is pathetic
<Damos> 13brb
<Armageddon> Did something happen on TST to make you come here or something? Or did you just want to?
<Armageddon> xD
<Damos> 13btb
<Armageddon> ok
<Quanyails> 7What was the difference between TimeShift's positions?
<Armageddon> !pokemon !type
<Sneas> Armageddon, you are the 12Water type!
<Nightshadow|VNC> Armageddon, you are a 15Skitty.

<Articuno> 12No
<Armageddon> swimming skitty = bad
<Aurora> 6skylands, why would that do anything?
<Articuno> 12He permanently deleted it
<Skylands> 10:/
<Aurora> 6he'd just not come on even if it could be restored
<Articuno> 12Then again I have the backup from a few days ago..
<Quanyails> 7Can you back up an individual account?
<Articuno> 12Yep

<Articuno> 12Nope not anymore
<Quanyails> 7The account itself, I mean.

<theguesst> Anyone want to say anything?
<Articuno> 12Honor? What's this got to do with pride and that?
<Andres> Maybe someone noticed.
<Icy> This one is too.

<Soyuz> Armageddon; YESH

<LaptopAristeo> Hi Andres :)
<Articuno> 12I asked him a simple question, "Would you prefer this?" and he didn't respond so fair enough I guess
<Quanyails> 7Wanted to go out with a bang.
<Aurora> 6nothing had even happened, he just simply ignored us
<Articuno> 12I sometimes wonder if he's really nearly 30 years old..

<Articuno> 12Anyway my mum wants me to ring her, bbs
<Aurora> 6he's got the stupidest outlook on "honor"
<Icy> And everyone else who's always quiet...
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> yeah
<Quanyails> !define honor
<[TST]Bot> -!- award: a tangible symbol signifying approval or distinction; "an award for bravery"
<Justin_Long_Fanatic> like RedDragonX
<Aurora> 6how is completely ignoring us, when we were trying to talk to him in a civilized way, honorable?
<Quanyails> 7No, not quite: that's the noun.
<Icy> Who's RedDragonX?
<Aurora> 6if you want to be straight, he lost it ages ago
<Damos> 13backy

<Damos> 13so why did Timy delete the account
<theguesst> I was going to ask him if he could really accept losing all the work he put into the site
<Armageddon> o.o

<Air> 6Wow.

*Misty 13runs
<Aurora> 6Andyman, we have the rule now
<Air> 6lolo.
<Aurora> 6but Articuno insist we leave this one here, as she's already registered
<Air> 6Hey Misty.
<Andyman> Because every once in a while we have an 11- or 12-year-old like sky4eva or Pokewalkercheat who annoy the crap out of people.
<Andyman> And good. Though I can't see it now :/
<Glacymr> 12Feather annoys people D:

<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Aurora> 6wow
<Aurora> 6ok well, why did you ban her in the first place?
<drfsupercenter> 03because she was being annoying and doing crap like that
<drfsupercenter> 03not to mention she's 9
<Aurora> 6>_> forgot the age
<drfsupercenter> 03and she acts her age
<Andyman> She's just too young for this place
<AeroDracohem> lol
<Aurora> 6as is a certain someone on forums
<Aurora> 6:|
<Feather> 10Hmm
<Glacymr> 12look at Feather
<Andyman> sky4eva can easily become the next Pokewalkercheat, do not worry
<Glacymr> 12she's like.... 10
<Feather> 10But her IP didn't match Ninetailes' IP on the forum
<Feather> 10I'm 13 almost 14 :|
<Glacymr> 12weren't you 10 at one point?
<Aurora> 6shhhhhhh
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Feather> 10Yes XD
<Glacymr> 12yes i asked a stupid question
<AeroDracohem> XD
<Glacymr> 12:P
<Skylands> 10[20:06] <%Feather> But her IP didn't match Ninetailes' IP on the forum <- Proxies, but I don't expect a 9 year old to know about those :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Glacymr was 10 at one point too
<Feather> 10yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Mibbit *IS* a proxy
<Glacymr> 12drf wasn't
<Feather> 10I don't even know anything about proxies LOL
<Glacymr> 12he skiped from 9 to 11
<drfsupercenter> 03Mibbit is a proxy
<drfsupercenter> 03it's why I use it at work
<Lyon> 04Feather
<drfsupercenter> 03because I can't use port 66676
<Lyon> 04you download it
<drfsupercenter> 03-6
<Feather> 10drf I whoised her before she left
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Lyon> 04and tada
<Andyman> I'm 22.
<Feather> 10Air is 180115d9@ircip2.mibbit.com * c-24-1-21-217.hsd1.il.comcast.net
<Lyon> 04.I think
<drfsupercenter> 03c-24-1-21-217.hsd1.il.comcast.net <- that's not an IP
<drfsupercenter> 03that's a hostmask
<Aurora> 6sigh
<Aurora> 6work in half an hour
<Aurora> 6and I've succeeded in doing nothing today
<Feather> 10oh
<Feather> 10Blah
<Feather> 10I just remembered I have to go afk soon
<drfsupercenter> 0324.1.21.217
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the IP
<drfsupercenter> 03what's her forum IP say?
*Skylands shrugs
<drfsupercenter> 03I love how people assume I'm some leet haxor because I know how to use IRC
<drfsupercenter> 03The way Mibbit works is the part before the @ is the person's IP address in hex
<drfsupercenter> 03just convert it to decimal XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and reverse it
<drfsupercenter> 03though the hostmask has the IP in it o.o
<Ace> Hm
<Asterisk> Aristeo
<Asterisk> Remember the last attack on your server?
*Stitch blinks.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Misty> 13ya but you did create an MIRC
<drfsupercenter> 03I just swallowed a piece of pencil lead
<drfsupercenter> 03I hope that's not bad LOL
*Misty 13runs
<Misty> 13and you know how to hack
<drfsupercenter> 03no I don't
<drfsupercenter> 03I can only hack the computer I'm using
<drfsupercenter> 03not other people's
<Stitch> I do.
<drfsupercenter> 03and heh, yeah, the portable mIRC thing, but I didn't make mIRC LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I just modified it to be portable :P
<Asterisk> Do you remember the date?
*Glacymr gives this computer to drf
<Andyman> Mod talk.
<Glacymr> 12now hack it

<drfsupercenter> 03EW HOR
<Lyon> 045 seconds passed after a mention of HoR and people haven't descended into an argument about it

<Lyon> 04wait nvm

<Altair> [8:15:40 pm] <06%drfsupercenter> 03EW HOR
<Skylands> 10also Altair
<Glacymr> 12honestly
<Altair> Am I good or what
<SheenaFox> XD
<Asterisk> Just wanted to see what Aristeo there did
<Lyon> 04lol
<Skylands> 10I'm want to speak with you privately :P
<Lyon> 04drf
<Damos> 13Sky you've been spying on me?
<Lyon> 04question: what do you have against HoR
<Stitch> We didn't.
<Altair> Sure XD
<Soyuz> Altair; well
<Stitch> The server Z:Lined every bot before it even connected.
<Altair> Lyon
<Asterisk> Eh, doesn't matter.
<Drake> 04?
<Soyuz> at least drake said that it'd be 5 seconds :P
<Feather> 10GAH I gotta go
<Feather> 10I
<Feather> 10I
<Feather> 10GRR
<Drake> 04yes Altair?
<SheenaFox> ...bye Feather?
<Lyon> 04cy
<Andyman> Bye Feather
<Lyon> 04cya*
<AeroDracohem> bai Feather~ O:
<Altair> They hate HoR for no reason
<Feather> 10I'll be back around in around an hour hopefully
<Feather> 10XD
<Soyuz> well they have a new reason maybe
<Altair> I wouldn't even ask XD
<SheenaFox> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03<Lyon> question: what do you have against HoR <- Hasn't that been asked over 9000 times?
<Drake> 04lol
<Lyon> 04nope
<Soyuz> unless I've just gone past their minds XD
<Lyon> 04not to me at least
<Lyon> 04I mean
<Lyon> 04I've been silent about my opinions on TST bashing HoR, but I'm getting real sick of it
<drfsupercenter> 03what is the POINT of HoR? It's just another TST that people started using
<Altair> haters gonna hate
<AeroDracohem> eh, I'm not so sure how this whole argument between TST and HoR happened, but I'll sit back and watch O:
<Lyon> 04it's a place where people can hang out and discuss Ho-Oh and other topics without getting bashed by the community or being flamed
<Lyon> 04I mean
<Andyman> *is thinking the same thing as Aero*
<drfsupercenter> 03Nobody bashes people for discussing Ho-Oh here
<Lyon> 04pfft
<drfsupercenter> 03Honestly I don't care what PokÃ©mon you like
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not a Lugia fan either
<Damos> 13brb
<Damos> 13no bbl
<Altair> lol ok
<Misty> 13bbl
<Altair> kk
<Lyon> 04anyway
<Lyon> 04if it was 'another TST' we'd be all over Lugia and Arti
<drfsupercenter> 03I just mean it's just another PokÃ©mon fan club, just aimed at Ho-Oh instead
<drfsupercenter> 03which is dumb
<drfsupercenter> 03you can discuss ho-oh here, nobody cares
<Lyon> 04so?
<Lyon> 04there are millions of Pokemon fan clubs on the internet
<drfsupercenter> 03and seeing as how it was inspired by TST anywayl...
<drfsupercenter> 03-l
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but not ones started by former TST members
<Soyuz> Altair; everytime it comes up
<SheenaFox> Yeah
<Soyuz> apperently we get the hate D:
<AeroDracohem> loldramatime?
<Lyon> 04actually, there is alot of flaming of Ho-Oh on here wgenever we try to talk about it, which is why there hasn't been any discussion about Ho-Oh here
<SheenaFox> Yup o3o
<Glacymr> 12i'd assume one thing is that it doesn't have some people who come here
<Lyon> 04but you know
<Lyon> 04nevermind
<Andyman> kimi no mune ni la la la...
<Lyon> 04I know I started this
<drfsupercenter> 03<Glacymr> i'd assume one thing is that it doesn't have some people who come here <- yeah but I seem to recall it was started by TST members
<drfsupercenter> 03after seeing how awesome TST was LOL
<Lyon> 04but I think I'd better stop it now
<Skylands> 10[20:16] <Damos> Sky you've been spying on me? <- No, I can see everything that's being said on #Silverwings
<AeroDracohem> lol
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Altair> loldrama
<Glacymr> 12i'm just saying that some people would probably like it if they didn't like say for example.... Lyon
<Glacymr> 12they could to go HoR and basically have the same TST experience then without that one person
<Lyon> 04well put Glacymr
<Altair> HoR has other members from other sites, however the majority are from TST
<Soyuz> so another lulz fest? XD
<Glacymr> 12i originally went to HoR because i felt like i was going to be ran out of TST because of someone else who still comes here
<Glacymr> 12but as far as they knew didn't know HoR existed
<Spyrorocks> lol whos ddosing
<Asterisk> Termz
<Altair> I went there because I was friends of Nightshadow and yeah lol
<Glacymr> 12a single person can make a big impact on a community
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Skylands> 103[20:19] <%drfsupercenter> I just mean it's just another PokÃ©mon fan club, just aimed at Ho-Oh instead 10<- You could say the same for ANY Pokemon fansite
<Altair> ^ times 100
<drfsupercenter> 03I know people who go to HoR only because they know other people who don't use TST
<drfsupercenter> 03which is like
<drfsupercenter> 03they used to go here
<drfsupercenter> 03then they switched to HoR
<drfsupercenter> 03and now they brought over people with them that ALSO no longer go here
<drfsupercenter> 03they're fricking stealing our members
*drfsupercenter runs
<Altair> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just like
<drfsupercenter> 03if everybody was on both that would be fine
<drfsupercenter> 03but people leaving TST to go to HoR just pÂ¡sses me off
<Spyrorocks> whos that
<Altair> Some people there have never heard of TST
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03that's not my problem
<drfsupercenter> 03in fact most people here haven't heard of #pokemon-originals either
<Glacymr> 12drf also sometimes i tend to think being more popular
<drfsupercenter> 03but the few people from TST I told about it are still here
<Spyrorocks> Just get the host to setup a hardware ddos filter.
<Glacymr> 12being the more popular community
<Glacymr> 12is a bad thing, it's something i've hardwired into myself
<Altair> We never made HoR to be that way :P
<Glacymr> 12i guarentee that HoR probably gets less 10 year old trolls than TST does
<Andyman> Granted, TST has at least one per month on the forums alone
<Soyuz> ..oh god
<Quanyails> 7Well, expanding community.
<Altair> Happens to all sites
<Soyuz> there was an episode where Ash turned into a pikachu?
<Altair> that grow
<Drake> 04wat
<Glacymr> 12Hor will most likely get there as well
<Stitch> The server doesn't seem to be lagging.
<Glacymr> 12but for now
<Asterisk> Not anymore
<Spyrorocks> Look at this idiot http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=1900598
<Altair> Most likely not, we don't really advertise it much anymore
<Spyrorocks> some moron is posting in my thread
<Soyuz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEblRXZJl_k&NR=1
<Spyrorocks> bullshitting because he coulnd't scam
<Spyrorocks> me
<Soyuz> oh look animation fail
<Skylands> 10Duh
<Glacymr> 12doesn't matter
<Lyon> 04we're happy with out little tight-knit community
<Glacymr> 12the bigger it gets the most likely it's going to be a top pager for google searches
*Altair misses TST of two years ago
<Skylands> 10^
<Spyrorocks> He doesnt understand that i will not sell to him
<Soyuz> two tokepis
<Altair> True lol
<Altair> Anyway food
<Glacymr> 12guess what
<Glacymr> 12googling for ho-oh realms
<Glacymr> 12*i mean googling for ho-oh
<Glacymr> 12ho-oh realms is on the first page
<Glacymr> 12:P
<Lyon> 04lol
<Glacymr> 12just barely lol
<Stitch> Report him?
<drfsupercenter> 03* Altair misses TST of two years ago <- that's because of all the n00bs we have here now
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03also in case anyone is into classic Genesis gaming
<drfsupercenter> 03* Altair misses TST of two years ago
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<Quanyails> 7So is TST for Lugia, Glacy. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGhm8R9QySg
<Quanyails> 7But higher.
<drfsupercenter> 03Stupid clipboard
<Lyon> 04ohyay
<Proto> Send a squad of ninjas to his house?
<Andyman> Yeah... I kinda miss TST from when I first got here
<Lyon> 04now we're getting into who's higher on Google
<Quanyails> 7Articuno as well.
<Lyon> 04wonderful
<Quanyails> 7Who says we're arguing?
<Asterisk> Nuke?
<Lyon> 04did I ever say arguing?
<Glacymr> 12that is my wisdom
<Proto> Hydrogen?
<Quanyails> 7Touche.
<Stitch> Large Hadron Collider?
<Glacymr> 12Lyon in case you didn't notice
<Asterisk> ^
<Glacymr> 12i was supporting who didn't get as much hits on google :P
<Proto> Small Hadron Collider?
<Asterisk> Wouldn't do anything
<Glacymr> 12the less popular a site is, the more pure it remains
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Lyon> 04true enough
<Proto> Would be easier to transport
<Asterisk> Still
<Glacymr> 12Lyon
<Glacymr> 12pokebeach's chatroom
<Glacymr> 12literally bans a troll every day
<Proto> hmm
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Skylands> 10Try Serebii or PC
<Proto> commercial for the blackberry torch
<Glacymr> 12serebii are trolls
<Skylands> 10It's worse
<Glacymr> 12so they don't count
*Glacymr hides
<Proto> or touch, can't read very well
<Quanyails> 7Question; how will TST deal with people like that in case?
<Proto> the slidey one
<Glacymr> 12Skylands i heard serebii is really bad
<Glacymr> 12but i never checked it out because i have no interest in going there
<Skylands> 10It is
<Glacymr> 12i stay in pokebeach because i like talking online with people who have as much tcg knowledge as i do
<Skylands> 10I signed up there back in 2009, only stayed for a week
<Skylands> 10That's how quickly I soon despised it
<Glacymr> 12anyway i think it would be in everyone's best interest if this talk of communities is dropped
<Glacymr> 12who agrees?
<Glacymr> 12i leave my closing statement as "i'm neutral"
<Skylands> 10The silence speaks for itself
<Glacymr> 12hmm silence does speak volumes at times
<Glacymr> 12honestly though i owe a lot to TST
<Glacymr> 12and will do anything to help it grow
<Glacymr> 12however too much growth can be a bad thing
<Andyman> I lasted for like 2-3 weeks on Bulbagarden
<Quanyails> 7I thought we'd stop this discussion.
<Quanyails> 7Let's talk about...
<Glacymr> 12Andyman is made of 90% rocky rococo
<Aeroslash> hi QUan
<Aeroslash> *Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hi, Aero.
<Andyman> :)
<Quanyails> 7The weather?
<Aeroslash> hot
<Aeroslash> and sunsetty
<Glacymr> 12however Andyman doesn't know i go to rocky rococo every week
<Andyman> I had some Rocky's on Friday... I can't get enough of it
<Glacymr> 12to not just eat
<Andyman> You still do?
<Glacymr> 12but to play pokemon there
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Quanyails> 7Hot, but dark.
<Glacymr> 12pokemon and pizza nothing is better
<Glacymr> 12yes i do
<Glacymr> 12i dunno Andyman i kind of getting tired of it but only because i go there every week
<Glacymr> 12last time i was there i didn't even have any pizza i ordered a chocolate milk XD
<Andyman> Well that's understandable. But I go there like twice a month, maybe thrice
<Glacymr> 12Andyman i would cry if i ever got stuck working at rocky rococo
<Glacymr> 12once a week is hard enough but every day?
<Andyman> Yeah... it's probably not as appealing as it sounds.
<Glacymr> 12I probably wouldn't get tired of just rocky pizza
<Glacymr> 12i'd probably just get sick of pizza in general
<Andyman> brb

<Icy> Why would you not?
<JLF> i didn't once
<JLF> i waited
<JLF> lol
<Prince-dari> More interesting than Gaul's laser eye, at least.
<JLF> i was asking what gaul does if you wait
<JLF> on ur fury
<JLF> now i know
<Icy> That part with Gual was kinda pointless....
<JLF> hey Prince-dari, do u start over from the beginning or just that part?
<Prince-dari> Over from the beginning.
<JLF> darn
<JLF> that's messed up
<Prince-dari> I remember being po'd about that.

<TTEchidna> Recently, we along with several others launched NIWA.
<TTEchidna> An alliance of independent Nintendo-based wikis.
<sally> Stitch: did you know you can remove the chips after you put them in?
<Stitch> Yep.
<TTEchidna> You guys and SonicRetro are two non-Nintendo video game canon wikis that I know are good, independent communities.
*sally wonders if that is significant
<EpicStatsGuy> inb4 fail
<sally> Stitch: what items do you have?
<Stitch> Bible, watch, evidence, shampoo, shotgun, chips, key.
<sally> open the bible
*where noms, looks, reads, washes, unlocks, shoots, uses.

<Stitch> 6 digits.
<Stitch> My bad.
<TTEchidna> Anyway. I'll be out now. But you can go on and bug me on Bulba,
<sally> hmm..

<Stitch> I think it's something to do with the "NKJV" on the cover.

<Quanyails> 7On another note, if you haven't heard: http://gajus-tempus.deviantart.com/journal/34177320/
<DarkTruth> I am tired still to
<Glacymr> 12hi Articuno :D
<Articuno> 12Yeh I have seen it
<Glacymr> 12how goes
<Articuno> 12It's ridiculous
<Articuno> 12Not so good Glacymr
<Glacymr> 12oh :<
<Articuno> 12Seriously if anyone thinks that ignoring your friends is the way to help them or whatever.. they can't be a very good friend at all
<drf|work> um, wtf
<Articuno> 12Glacymr, remember when you, me, Hawkie, Kyu and other mods had that discussion about you on the team?
<drf|work> what happened to that "Computer help and advice" section?
<Curly> I should have taken that nap earlier. too late now :<
<drf|work> on the forums?
<Glacymr> 12o-O yeah
<drf|work> it's not there anymore o.o
<Articuno> 12Oh I removed that, it was pretty dead, everything can go on random chatter instead
<Articuno> 12Anyway Glacymr
<drf|work> oh OK
<Hawkie> Hm=
<Articuno> 12I went into that dsicussion thinking I knew what I wanted to do, but Kyu and you managed to change my mind and talk me into a better decision right?
<Hawkie> ?
<Articuno> 12That is what any normal discussion should be like
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Articuno> 12However, when I proposed my idea to TimeShift, he ignored me and then quit and then deleted his account!
<Articuno> 12Now hes saying that the decisison was definite and that I never gave him the option! WTF
<Hawkie> O-o
<Quanyails> 7And he says he was forced into it. :|
<drf|work> same with when you wanted to kick me off the modding team
<Glacymr> 12?
*Hawkie looks @ link
<Articuno> 12Yeh!
<Hawkie> Heh
<Articuno> 12DRF yeh
<Glacymr> 12that makes no sense
<Articuno> 12You talked me out of that didn't you?
<drf|work> yeah
<Articuno> 12Not all of my decisions are definite and final, that is why I ALWAYS talk about things with people first

<drf|work> "Oh, you guys think you're cool, trying to lock me in here?"
<Glacymr> 12:D
<Roara|FoodRaid> 6LOL
<drf|work> so I rammed all my body weight against the door and sent them literally flying backwards
<drf|work> and was like "Never try to lock a fat person in a bathroom, it doesn't work"
*Roara|FoodRaid 6LOL
<drf|work> well then one of the other kids had to use the bathroom
<drf|work> and I took the other 3 and just pushed them in the stall
<drf|work> and put MY weight against the door

<drf|work> I'll only let you out if you promise to behave
<drf|work> and they were like OK fine

<Andres> Thank you, Curly :o
<Andres> And hello.
<May> ffff
<RoarArt> 6Quanyails
<Quanyails> 7Yes?
<Quanyails> 7Whoops, lag. Bear with me, Rora.
<May> black and white looks like the same old evil team and collect gym badges
<RoarArt> 6lol lag
<RoarArt> 6you have that a lot
<RoarArt> 6:P
<RoarArt> 6anyways
<RoarArt> 6what's the deal with suiguno
<Quanyails> 7Okay, lag gone.
<RoarArt> 6*suiguno's head
<RoarArt> 6that head feather, the big one
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Glacymr> 12brb
<Quanyails> 7Think of it like Suicune's crest, but vertically.
<DarkTruth> hey
<RoarArt> 6so it's connected on both ends? or is it a feather connected only at the base?
*Andres is considering going outside... D:
<May> I thought it was just the middle crest feather in the shape of a suicune crest
<Curly> so good news :O
<Curly> my mother is paying my money back >.>
<RoarArt> 6dude
<RoarArt> 6dude
<RoarArt> 6due
<RoarArt> 6jfbdgkr
<Curly> $70 a month
<RoarArt> 6dfkbhfgdh'dfh
<RoarArt> 6d
<RoarArt> 6tj
<RoarArt> 6dy
<Quanyails> 7o_O
<RoarArt> 6TMs will no longer expire after one use
<May> what
<DarkTruth> wow
<DarkTruth> O_O
<May> that's actually really good
<DarkTruth> I am surprised
<Curly> me too
<RoarArt> 6anyways quan
<RoarArt> 6http://taravalentine.deviantart.com/art/Suiguno-143591174
<RoarArt> 6is it like that?
<Sky> hi hi
<May> oh a sky
<Sky> lol
<RoarArt> 6because that looks like a pikmin, not a suicune crest
*Sky hugs may
*May is hugged
*May mews
<Quanyails> 7Well, I've never given it too much thought. I always just kept the tip out of sight. :P
<Aristeo> :O
<Quanyails> 7Would you like a definite answer or interpret it?
*Aristeo steals some of Curly's cold
<RoarArt> 6I'd like to be as accurate as possible
<RoarArt> 6so explain plz
<Quanyails> 7Okay, then.
<RoarArt> 6woah
<RoarArt> 6just had a momentary happier than ever moment
<RoarArt> 6felt really good 8D
<Quanyails> 7In that case, it's not a single feather, but a crest. It's like Lugia's in this case, then, attached both ends.
<Quanyails> 7And my grammar went boom.
<RoarArt> 6lol
<RoarArt> 6so
<Quanyails> 7Or you can think of it like Articuno's crest. :P
<Quanyails> 7Same idea, except with a hole.
<RoarArt> 6it's basically like suicune's crest, a bone with a hollow in the middle, only flipped around to sideways version?
<Sky> ...
<RoarArt> 6or is it not bone?
<Sky> Wow
<RoarArt> 6yes bone/not bone matters lol
<Sky> A bone.
<Sky> Lol.
<Quanyails> 7You're not Suiguno's creator, Sky.
<Sky> ...
<RoarArt> 6you don't even know what I'm talking about lolololol
<Sky> Lol.
<Quanyails> 7Well, it's hard, for one.
<Sky> Suiguno creator?
<RoarArt> 6suiguno is quan's fakemon OC
<RoarArt> 6quan, hard, so it's solid
<RoarArt> 6cartilage then?
<Sky> Oh...
<Quanyails> 7Sure, let's go with that. :3
<Sky> What?
<Quanyails> 7Feel free to stay out of this conversation, Sky.
<RoarArt> 6ok
<RoarArt> 6got a sketch line out
<RoarArt> 6lined
<Curly> if you steal my cold does that mean it's even more cold?
<Sky> Why should i i am on this chat Quan.
<RoarArt> 6and for clarification, quan, your sprite has two tail feathers, and the interpretation is 3
<RoarArt> 6so either there's 2, or your third one is hidden in the sprite
<Aristeo> Nuh uh
<Quanyails> 7I gave it two, since Suicune had those two tail-ribbons.
<Aristeo> Well
<Aristeo> More accurately
<RoarArt> 6k thats what I thought
*Aristeo gives Curly some of his heat
<Sheenaero> Articuno, are you there? O:
<DarkTruth> he needs to take it with a multi dimensional wormhole
<Quanyails> 7And Sky, sorry, but the conversation doesn't involve you.
<DarkTruth> then it will be replaced with warmth
<Quanyails> 7But if you want, you can draw Suiguno as well. :P
<RoarArt> 6lol
*Curly hopes the heat will melt away the clouds
<Sky> ...
<Aristeo> :D
<Glacymr> 12whee
<Sky> And no RoarART, Articuno is not there.
<RoarArt> 6wow
<RoarArt> 6.....
<Sheenaero> wat
<RoarArt> 6Arti's online, I'm not the one who asked ._.
<Sky> Oh lol
<Sheenaero> o3o
<RoarArt> 6sheena/aero/whoever asked, she's online yeah
<RoarArt> 6but she went afk a while ago
<Sheenaero> ah, okay then
<Sky> I meant Sheenaero lol
<May> Aero
<RoarArt> 6Hmm
*May pokes
<RoarArt> 6I'm happy with the perspective on this one
*Sheenaero flails
<Quanyails> 7Okay, Rora. :P

<Quanyails> 7http://graygreen.deviantart.com/art/PokeWolves-151075932 <-- By the way...
<May> both of the sprites she made have two tails
<May> fanart is never accurate you know
<RoarArt> 6yeah did you see my comment down there?
<RoarArt> 6may I know
<RoarArt> 6but it's a heck of a lot easier going off a bigger reference
<RoarArt> 6I was checking for accuracy as I always do
<Quanyails> 7Yes, I noticed the comment, and the reply. Any reply to that, then?
<Espeon> At least he/she doesn't deny it and call you names. Must be in the smarter half of the deviantart community
*Espeon dies
<RoarArt> 6see
<RoarArt> 6I even agree with that statement, espeon
<RoarArt> 6!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to RoarArt for 13 minutes
<Espeon> gasp
<Curly> sooo sleepy
<Espeon> most people call you all sorts of things, then block you <<
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<RoarArt> 6yup
<RoarArt> 6I've had that
<RoarArt> 6and every single time they've been removed

<RoarArt> 6your sprites

*Espeon dies

<RoarArt> 6have different colored legs
<RoarArt> 6one has white, one dark blue
<Quanyails> 7Ah. Hmm...
<May> there was this one time I thought somebody stole my MayOkami wolf design, but then I realized it was just an Ammy with inverted colors
<May> I didn't realize that until then
<Quanyails> 7I think the blue legs look better.

<Cpt_Uriel_Ventris> never heard of Final Liberation
<Quanyails> 7Okay.

<RoarArt> 6looks very close to being done
<Cpt_Uriel_Ventris> hmm
<RoarArt> 6and that was a week ago
<Curly> it was basically a simulator of the board game
<Curly> which made it lame because the board game is better in person
<Articuno> 12Still got loads to do but the final obstacle is being taking care of by Lugia now
