The Plot :P
there
ps2 is pissing me off
how did I just make that mistake
i need sleep
staying up reading fanfiction multiple nights in a row = bad plan
Me too... but I don't think I'll be able to get any
You can't play PS2 games on a PS3, silly pony!
I dont play enough with em any more to warent geting it.
Coopmore: also ITS OVER 9000!
meh
that too
are you talking about a ps2?
I think the fan-base enhances the enjoyment of the show. Apart from the more...vocal weirdos there isn't anything that the fandom does that isn't awesome in some way
whats being played? or supposed to be played?
I still have mine and it functions fine
/me trys a diffrent disk.
oh they took away the crosscompatability
9it has Gunbuster too
9and Eva
with the slim
and i think actually
the slim is awesome
cant play ps2 games
i have a slim too
dumb ps2
why won't you work
also i dont think you're ps2 should have proken
odd a ps2 that wont play ps2?!
i played battlefront 2 recently
...
games?
Coopmore:
Battlefront.. Star Wars Battlefront?
9in SRW Z2
They condensed a ps2
TrollightSparkle: yes, battlefront 2
and put it into the ps3
then added something that recognizes the system differences
lol nice.
Fuck yes.
<3
load
like 40+
lol ballslods
alright
i only play lfd2 and tf2
are the stars moderators?
and ps3 games
yeah it's looking thatway
good ol playstation logo the memorues
MUTANTPANDA521: Moderators have colored text.
ps2 that can't play ps2 games
i just have too many games
might have to show anime or noting.
re4
0ya i got a warning for accidently using it..
yeah
0never use color text?
is that in ascii?
its reseverd for mods awolf
Color text is only for Mods.
Plus it's just annoying if everyone used it.
problem with ps2 was it wasnt compatible with the ps2 games
I have three bookshelves worth of anime :p
i copied from the leader, silentthought
bleach
old ps2 is old
theres a remixed song w luna
yes
i think it may have been on eqd at some point
Coopmore:…what?
theres a remixed song with luna of everything
/me brohoofs MUTANTPANDA521.
*1
too much was expected of it
osu
like dnf. it was fantastic
wtf i _cannot_ type tonight
never mind
its amazing
i did not mean to compare to dnf
?
uh
its great, but i thought it was too easy
0No. People overhype ALL the things
Well, we'll see about BF3.
TrollightSparkle: yes
bf3
um not that i know of
slamost
Coopmore: Wait for DLC to come out for difficult tests.
In fact, they already have.
BF3, Uncharted 3, Rage..
I hate publishers.
Although Rage doesn't look.. great.
cod mw 3
Ew MW3.
MW3 is going to be alto more like cod4
anyone heard of just cause 2?
yes
Heard of Just Cause, wanted to play it.
TrollightSparkle: its worth it
its great, but as tb said, its have gun shoot man
agreed coopmore
But many publishers are abusing consumer rights and milking gamers.
I agree, an it's match making is bad.
games
Just Cause 2...
Coopmore: i just like the massivemenss
All you need to know
TrollightSparkle: not sure, i have it on ps3
Is that a parachute and a grappling hook
BEST TRANSPORTATION EVER
Then yeah, probbaly.
you have infinite parachutes
that appear out of nowhere
The best transportation was the grapple hook in Goldeneye :p
Oreos AND milk. Let's not leave that out.
There was no grapple hook in Goldeneye.
but somehow has reasonable physics
Unless you're talking about the Nazivision version.
TrollightSparkle: Lets put it like this: You can surf a 747.
also the voice acting is deadly bad in an unapologetic way
There was a grapple hook in Nightfire, and Tomorrow Never Dies(I think).
0TrollightSparkle oreos and milk is gross..
Yeah there was. You culd swing around like Spiderman... I did it all the time
oh yeah u can do nearly anything
cant wait for Skyrim!
helicopters in bf2 MUTANTPANDA521
battlefield 2 is still fun XD
I'm intent on trying Elder Scrolls and buying BF2.

THEY NEED MASS PONY!
YES!
lol
there's probably already a fanfic
0BA *like*
TrollightSparkle: Me neither.
Or PONY FANTASY 13!!
battle pony 3
FF13 was.. alright.
lmmfao
modern warmare 3
I played the first Mass effect, just a little bit anyway.
(Dead Space)
ff7 was the best in my opinion
grr u beat me to it!
0TrollightSparkle *like*
Necromorph ponies on the other hand.. :P
9oh hey guys
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU21AG8HWhk&feature=player_embedded

whens the marathon?
When IS the marithon?!?

It's right after Movie night technically
Well everypony, I must retire as well..
8 PM PST
TrollightSparkle: cya
Night TrollightSparkle
Billaxle: No problem.
Night! :)
I'm going to go as well. I'm fading fast. nighty night
YESYESYESYESYESYES! ill most definately be here for the marathon!
Haha...references.
I would attend the marathon but I work all weekend
billaxle ok
FORTUNATELY I don't have to work until 10 AM on Saturday.
Use X-FER!
lol
How long is the Marathon?
Until season 2 airs
Whoa...stream sputtered
9am
Huzzah!
About 9.5 to 10 Hours.
lol
its a 2 part episode eh?
yes... yes it is
9.5 is 24 episodes
10 would be 25
lol
They're technically about 22 minutes long, not 30 minutes lol
expect around 10 hours with breaks
That's where I get that figure.
Multiply 22 minutes by 26
You get about 9.5
wait
Or 9.5 hours after dividing by 60
are there 24 or 26 eps in Season 1?
26
26 Episodes
*is scared of playing story of the blanks*
and they're completely out of order XD
26 glorious eps
Tritoch OH NOES

WTF THIS SONG IS EVEN IN HALO
I didn't believe anything I saw until The Hub posted a preview clip
Then I broke under and watched it :(
lets watch every episode backwarfs
or all the time...
played in reverse
And changed in pitch
I tryed selling them on one of the reorders but I dont think they want to cause people argue over the orders
http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=pony+chronology#/d482u2p
with sound
its just ;iajc;saaskdjf;kdsajf;jdsf FRIEEENDS

*Is tempted to switch to either one of his OCs or his Ponysona*
/me facepalms as he forgot that this is IRC
Just wait until Fighting is Magic comes out, desertponi
Ok then, this time for reals, nighty night
>I would like to hug a pony nonsexually
Loooooocke!
NAME HIM RARITY
FUCK
YOU
lol
LOCKE STOP TRYING TO BE COOL
anyone
?
nah.
Billaxle: Wow, that's really appropriate...
Billaxle: why do i feel this has happened to you
also that was INCREDIBLY non squiter
sequiter
SUDDENLY MOOGLES
KUPOP
Kupo!
kupo
0.0 Tough little guys aren't they . . .
damn they tore those enemies apart
Then why the fuck was this spammed in my bred
hey, thats my thing
but FFvI is one of the best FF's of all time
YALL BUNCHA APPLEHEADED NIGGRS
OF ALL TIME!
Wow, not cool desertponi
Ponies are happening later brah, chill
you know whats not cool
desertponi: is being a jerk
not streaming ponies
Where's a mod when you need one?
desertponi: we all have them probably
i'm just gonna sit this one out...
on hdd
or we all are apparently
suddenly chatkill.
where the fuck are the ponies
desertponi recieves -1000 points
and hub
hush
and memebase
equestria.
gonna have to be more exact then that desertponi
Trolls die in the silence
we probably got rid of him via not saying anything for a straight minute
eeeeeeyup
hi
darn
that was great
me KanyeEast
i concur
she's quite the character
she is KanyeEast just pre-production though
Her Team is good enough to make it epic
and he seems like a boss too
and its not as if
she animated it
wrote it
lol Billaxle thats the hope
but probably
when has a show gotten worse in season 2
don't answer that
its more than just hope, lol.
usually a reasonably good show doesnt go downhill production wise till like season 4 at elast
and this show is epic win
or if they make a movie
swhoah a movie
i dunno how that would work
probably some epic adventure story
9Fucking Staedler
PONIES
no wait
still not ponies
Billaxle: that is pretty unlucky
i personally like pens though XD
i haz fountain pen
i have a pony irl
I prefer the manga pens i can buy online : P
KanyeEast: we're all entitled to an opinion
like a fountain pen, but with an actual point indstead of a ball
yeah
its fine to like pens, I use quite a few myself
a nib its called
it lives in its own room
its alluminum
just the whole "un eraseable" part
the nib isn't changeable
it is
yeah but when you're trying to take like 400 notes a second
if it breaks i can change it
its a literall fountain pen
unless you swap out the nib from an evirely different pen
9can't even find my Oh-Fives now
using capillary action
its a changeable nib...
locke? why are you adventuring with an english philospher from the enlightenment?
its designed with a ink release part attached to the nib
a
u kno like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen
and uses ink cartridges
yeah
exactly
Why do they even call it a fountain pen? It doesn't even shoot out the ink like a fountain...
its not like calligraphy pens imean
well
those are slightly different
lol
cause those have
a specific nib
just a dif nib really though like a broad one allowing a range of line thickness
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE PONIES
9I'll have to use an Oh-Seven
9*groan* I hate Oh-Sevens
9too thinck
9desertponi: the marathon is tomorrow
FUCK THAT
SHIT STARTS NOW
desertponi: just ignore him
NAME HIM RARITY
OKAY
9I know
HE WAS TOTALLY RARITY
or just love/ tolerate him
Haha finally
Edgar is totally Applejack anyway
same you know the 6 letter only for names
9yeah
9but that's a warning kick
When is he allowed back?
in 1000 years
he WAS annoying, but i can tell he wants the stream. lol
they should get banhammered to the moon for 1000 years
That's quite a long time.
lol, thats how it works on my mincraft server : P
9he already is
That's how they do it for Xbox Live permabans. They set the ban-lift date to 12/31/9999 or something.
hold on who's getting the banhammer?
noone, Yet...
Desertponi is about to Coopmore
Or was...
I can't wait till Saturday :D I'm making a pizza at 8 am and getting it ready for the premiere
thats may favorite episode KanyeEast
Haha
9so yeah
Kirk being all awesome
…now I want to be kicked :(
9kicks are more warning-ish than anything
spok: very perceptive creatures
spock
i was like "HUH?!? Whaddidido?!" lol
9yes
Lol, didn't know you could kick yourself...
meta kick
9*myself
Kickception, lol

I have the DS version is quite good
its saoundtrack was saweet
go shopping!
you need shitloads of potions!
but this one
"WELCOME! IT'S ELF'S WORLD!" Hahahaha

Then the rival was a monster XD
translated to engrish

Totally,
but
wait for kefka scene
Do it after that
never played it though =p
oh, then this is going to be goood!! >:}
theres like 56 parts now though XD
they call the main character, they chose girl, eggie XD

and whenever you place an item in the back its like eggie drug back f*ck

and yes, dr.who is amazing
1 day and about 7 hours I think..
Ok
Thanks.
i bet we hit 1000+
more like
OVER 9000!!!!!
that wouldn't make a bit of difference
because the stream would become inert
I'm just gonna say that the movie was a bad idea
a very bad idea XD
you guys should stream The Room at some point! lol
eh?
oh, it hought it was just repeating
it was
Chocobos out of F***ing Nowhere!
lol
Castle Lagaan!
i have no idea anymore, lol
Uggh…I'm hungry again :/
I never really liked Kefka...XD
Jon Irenicus is my favorite rpg villain of all time
Mine was probably...Kain,does Kain Highwind count?
He was technically both good and bad...

Piratebay if you know how to use torrents
Get u-torrent
and then DL all pony
yeah but that requires me to have it constantly seeding unless others seed
from Piratebay
torrenting is easy enough.
i know
Stop the presses!

is easy
Use piratebay or ISOhunt
thing*
it is easy but he's trying to distribute
think
yeah

It's not like they already yesterday posted the "flier" of this weekend's events
yeah that too RP
...to be honest, I've never saw BR.
12 hours 'til Blade RUnner
Saw it once. Was pretty meh...
XD
Well it's not as good as the book
Nothing ever is
but still very good, I thought
Takuanuva, that movie is awesome. One of the best hard Sci-Fi movies.
Must not forget the magnets
I don't say it isn't good
At the MAGNETO!!!
The best sci-fi movie of course is Brazil :P
Ugh no it is not
If only because of how great it was for the time it came out.
Pretty fine actually. Just got depressed when I read todays news...
i think it had.And it's a she
Also: Best sci-fi movie is Highlander 2
Anyone plays "Osu!" ?
Best Sci-Fi movie is Robowar
Takes freaking long enough
I'm trying not to worry about the economy too much...
Yeah. I mean there is nothing one can do from the bottom when it come to economy when even the people at the top cant always do something.
http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1963789531_f6942837d6_o.jpg <-- Now that's a clue bat.
when does stream start
Hat, in 12 hours.
That's Dokkuro-chan, isn't it?
ty
Don't hate me but my favorite Sci-Fi movie is District 9.
It's been a while since I watched that.
And her club, Excalibolg.
my fav sci fi is Moon
MOON!!!
Moon is my second best favorite
It is in my top 10 sci-fi movies
She's ranked #25 in my country as a top player
Clint Mansell did such a great score for that movie.
I need to watch it
same
Which?
D9?
D9 changed a bit halfway through
Right. Word of advice. Don't go watching it expecting anything.
I-ma-gi-naaaaa-tion
i like the action though
Keep open mind.
I don't really expect anything, except that it has something to do with aliens. :P
it had bad moonrover effects but they weren't terrible
might even sneak luna in on a special directors cut
...of the moon.
Source Code was good too, same director
Starship troopers would probably be up there with my favorite Sci-Fi movies...
omc
Oh man, that comic on EqD...
And Aliens
Starship Troopers seems like a movie MADE to be bad
No I did not.
I was here.
you were there back then?
Darn, I didn'T think you were around that early
Yeah. I've been here since sometime may.
I know it's over the top and silly, but that's the charm
Not 24-7 but for the BMN's
And don't sweat about it. You can't always remember everypony.
I guess it's an alternate theory to how S2 might start :P
Few can say they have
I guess I have been :P
its strange how they are airing part 1 twice consecutively
?
/me meows at Luna
That comic makes no sense...
:o
LUNA!

hey dari, facny seein you
well, it didnt help that it was out of commission for about a week
I mean I can't load up the site, would have told SR, but I don't think he's on.
Just AFK
I may be looking for a Skylanders forum, when one one eventually is created
suprised there hasnt been on yet. I havent found one though
I'm pretty disappointed by it.
9hey dari
9...what's SF?
1 minute and 24 hours to go
It's a forum.
24 hours to go
yes
he negative response to it is sickening to me
Cool. I've played the Legends trilogy, that was nice.
07Just curious

That post has a Majora's Mask theme
The EqD post
MFW EQD broke my script somehow.

Nothing's gone wrong with it for weeks.

My Little Alicorn: return of the Alfalfa Monster!
I trust her opinion enough that I was willing to give it a change without any preconceptions.
that's important
I'm 16, birthday's July 6th.
too many people click links wit the prenotioin that its a stupid cartoon
9he's 16, and also a genius when it comes to coding
speaking of which, I still cant figure out how to get here using mirc
With mIRC just type /server irc.ponychat.net
0because its not on mirc by default.
Then /join #bronystate
Thus I Came
Or type /server irc.ponychat.net -j #bronystate
9hey guys I think I'll stream some bootfighter once this download of mine is done
To be fair, I haven't used mIRC in ages.
hazah!
0i believe the line is Huzzah!
the problem liesw with people having a problem with future developers trying to push Spyro in the ground
07Get some sleep DerpDeDerps
and while the later games arent as good, I dont like to throw the baby out with the bathwater
the LoS was 'that' bad
Insomniac didn't dump Spyro.
They never owned it.
i know
15I mustn't For the Ponies.
That was aimed at Barry.
has this spyro discussion been really going on for around 12 hours?
...No?
sorry guys, I'm back...
Okay now is my Colours o?
*Off
i left with people talking about it i think.. then i come back to people talking about it
sorry, its just two of us talking purple dragons, lol
Purples Dragons are Best Dragons
"can't sleep.. talking about spyro"
We can hope.
0then again even the games i heard were "hard" were still not much of a problem.
Does a Mustered count?
0no, mustered does not count.
I now see that I quoted that Wrong :P
I think you meant the condiment mustard.
Damn it lack of Sleep You Win Again!
yep
it always does
07Poor thing
Hi Luna!!
07Hello Barry

and it turns out they air a rerun
?
Hub be trollin
nah, impossible.
Them Hubs they done lied to us!
ok ok, not possible
Can't speak about it here though.
Or They exploded.... TWICE

They Kill my whole family....
*Killed
squirtle squirtle
:P
Like a Washing machine....
0that seems lame to me.
the: Lawl, a level 20 can easily kill a lvl 50
A lvl 20 can easily kill a lvl 100.
FlameTard GO!
0but games that say, you have no upgrades? well, i guess you COULD win on this huge monster....but only if you have some real skill to fight back with.
Take it Easy son now!
i wish they had pony characters in Skylanders. that would be schweet
0i feel that skill should take priority over level.
0pokemon isnt really tactics.
And it is.
>tactic
>strategy
Same thing.
0no. no they are not.
I disagree.
:P
I've always wondered,How they can talk perfectly Fine while in the Sea...
0a tactic is something you can adapt and change at any time.
0they are very good swimmers.
8okay...how much time do we exactly have before the stream starts?

mooooooooooooooooooooooon
oh right. Not luna, but moon.
TO THE MOOOOOON!
hehehehehe yeah
Celestia's mech
She banishes to the moon, not luna.
Sunstroke Star, the evil mare in the Sun.
9yeah, they do
9frankly they're not too practical most of the time
Dai-Guard time?
=| No 7 a.m. post on ED.
soon...
Gan means face in jap
It's Popo's mech!
9"Help meeeeeeeeeeee!!"
LUNA
9naw it was always meant to be Gundam
9because a Gun with the stopping power of a Dam
They changed it to dam. =3
But is it piloted by the FAAAbulous Ginga Bishounen?
/me quits his no-pony fast early
dat jetpack
The Yatate team combined the English word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to form the name Gundom.
/me 0doesn't like some of the rules for the server, but sees why they are there.
Bunny-mech, go!
9Bunny? More like Dreadlocks
(due to the /me not being reddis)
uwaaaaaaaa
*reddish
where is Dai-Guard?
9Rainbow Dash would totally pilot this
nah
/me certainly doesn't.
dodge
the: nah, it just suggests that you tried another color but had to change back
9ohai Ledouche
Lelouch?
=s
i just hopped on
Dat Colors
9yeah
FLOW = awesome
9DAT EVIL LAUGH
it's not his day
Lelouche's seiyuu is actually pretty good. I remember him and Kallen's seiyuu in Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf).
why does it say rainbow dash is the best pony when she is certanly not :)
9Crowe Broust says: "Ammo conservation? What's that?"
Clearly Pinkie Pie is best pony.
yes
:P
It's time somthing was made there
0rainbow is the best pony
apple jack is my fav
9"CHECK!"
There is a difference between "favorite pony" and "best" pony'
Lol, I don't even know why Lelouch is in this. He can't pilot. =s
http://images.4chan.org/a/src/1316181841297.png <-- *snerk*
Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are my favorite ponies
9Pon, C.C. does all of the pilotan I think
my favourtie are pinkie and rainbow
Yeah
same, but pinkie is "best"
but Rarity is indisputably best pony
9also his "Tactical Command" Menu is BOSS
But he shouldn't be in there.
Meh
No way, Rainbow is best pony
never!
Pretty sure people are just kidding when they say "best pony"
*GAAAAAAASSP*
I don't think anyone mean "objectively best"
0Shhhh!
Every pony is best pony
SNIPING TIME
9also
Lohengramm >>>>>>>> Lelouch

Rarity, works the harderst, she the most mature, and the most creative. She is the only one of the ponies to have created and run her own business.
Yang Wenri is my favorite character evar.
NwDCD, my exact problem with One Piece
/me is the devil's advocate
:>
applejack maybe didnt create it but she works very hard
omg
9enemies fighting enemies
9cool
She works hardest during harvest. Rarity works that hard all year round.
lol, the skull thing looks soooo cool
9man those Ganmen are FUCKED
Well, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's "job" is taking care of all the animals.
And Rarity sings
0rainbowdash needs more solos.
pinkie sings
And she rescued herself when she got kidnapped.
well pinkie was a pet alligator
through being a bitch...
he has no teeth:3
pinkie WAS?
wait..
wait
sorry
It's Pinkie Pie.
Before or after she made equestria?
pinkie can distort reallity
lol
Silk: Both.
After, I think
That's just how Pinkie Pie rolls
Pinkie Pie invented parties.
See you guys later
didn't SilkAMV work on ANthology?
She's just that awesome.
pinkie pie einvented everything... including celestia
Yus, that is me
O____O
9Pinkie Pie built Mazinger Z

I was going to wait until tonight to stop looking at ponies but I woke up too early today.

Kamille > Uso > Jadau > Amuro

I've gotten some very slight spoilers, but yeah, I'm NOT avoiding ponies.

0to avoid s2 spoilers

Loran == Hayate
Only the overall premise for Episode 1-2 is spoiled for me.

I like 90% of shipping >.>
0wait, you mean the kissy one?
wtf?! dash isnt gay...
9like the quality, buster?
i've read 80+ lesbian ship fics
I'm just a romantic.
Twixie's my preference.
0dash is shipped with everypony and everything.
i knows...
Only ones I don't like incest ships
GO DAI-GURREN
(And other problematic ones)
incest ships......
?
GO DAI-GUARD
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I don't really read shipping, unless it's peripheral or parody

Too much info!
BA BA BA BABABABABABABABBABA
Like #ponyspoilers
and talk to myself like a crazy person.
i don't like straight shipping. <.<
i dun know why
9BIG O!
9SHOW TIME!
Not because I'm opposed to lesbian Fluttershy, but because they're just such a cute couple
wtf is wrong with u ppl
0i read one where fluttershy groomed dash's wings.
pony porn?
0and made her POMF hard.
0no, no sexytime.
We're talking about shipping.
0just shipping
I don't read ship-fics. Well, I don't read fics that much but I did like The Night After.
still, pony lesbians?
AWW YEAH GO CROWE
9My Little SRW: Teamwork is SPIRALPOWER
i dont like clop-fics
90% of the developed characters in the show are female.
wtf
0as long as it includes dash.
Of course we'll have lesbian ships.
i clopped to ponies once, i was ready to kill myself
Closest thing I read to a ship was "Of Two Minds" where Twilight got stuck in Trixie's body.
sure we can have, but not like them
0dash is pretty.
thats just effed up
Was pretty interesting.
Dash is beautiful
She.
Pinkie, just go read lesbian ship fics.
no!
i was gonna say man or woman, but she is neither
you might understand...
lol
Eugh.
This baffles me
But it didn't ruin pinkie for me
Derpy seems kinda mean for an actual name.
hello
pinkie can be ruined :D
cant*
never plan to
read it
its good
0"one" of the forbidden fics?
9BURESTO FAIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

YES
i thought this was code
YES
YES
ULTRA COMBO
ya i was smiling through it until about half-way.. then it was just kinda uncool
The only disturbing thing about that fic was the grammar, at the time I read it.
I said it like 10 times already
http://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/ <-- Have some pie.

Seiei you aren't a Gundam.
i think
9someday
9I'll make SRW WITH PONIEEEEEEEEEEEES
9yeah
9but it still is one of the best series in the franchise
The last 10 episodes felt like the last 10 episodes of Ideon.
It's probably my favorite non-Tomino Gundam series.
Of course, it's 1. Victory, 2. Zeta, 3. Turn-A
9dat Chirico
Hey, when does the movie start?

Moon Punch time?
9this is Z2-1
9Z2-2 is gonna be released soon
Oh yeah I went there.
It's Air Man!
How many hours until the movie?
9I'm really curious as to how they'll handle the TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN
0is the pony movie 3rd gen?
8.5
The movie is G1
8 hours and 20 minutes, about, I think
0or which gen is it?

i can beat Halo by then
0alright

FreezwFrame Well in that case I'll be facing an all-nighter here in Spain.

Yup

Freaking airman

9 AM EDT
I'm talking the time at CET (Central Europe Time.
if i was to sleep now, how long would i have before i should wake up?
9I CAN defeat Air Man
lol, i am sorry i am sure all these questions must be fustrating
Which is 3 PM CET
9oh wow the flight pack raised Gurren Lagann's armor to kingdom come
i am in ireland
It has Gurren Lagann too owO
Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland?
is that a sword crotch?
The movies start today at 11 PM GMT, and the season 2 premiere airs at tomorrow at 1 PM GMT
It's at 2PM in Ireland, Happy-Kah
i know in my time season 2 starts at 3 pm tomorrow
That's 12p.m for me. Hurray
07Baka-Neku where you from?
oohhh that is awesome, thank you!
denmark =D
07ah :)
Heh
i have both passports!
I am in Spain.
Well, yeah. Each of the four nations that makes up the United Kingdom of Great Britain is quite autonomous.
and that's why you shouldn't say GMT, Espy, because now he thinks it starts an hour before it does :P
9Code Gee!Ass!!: Lelouch of the Dodging.
Well I'm off for lunch. See you all at the movies.
I dunno
Because people forget that Brit time only coincides with GMT when it's not Summer Time
;p
Bah, that's their problem.
Well, see you all!
tomorrow gonna be loaded with people >_<
I say GMT, because it /is/ GMT.
Well, not just their problem if everyone sees it that way...
i never understod GMT talk xD
neither have i
lol
GMT is also the name of a time zone, which is where the confusion lies.
9hang in there
i know i live in -1 somthing somthing
Is that really a mech?
i live at +0 gmt
i think
lol
Gurren Laggan needs some healz
9it's kay
thought it looked like Getter Robo
And you kinda have to keep Daylight Savings in mind. . .because there are large parts of the world that don't use it.
Not going to say anything more about it, people see GMT as UK time
even the half of the year that it isn't :P
Actually, you set "automatically detect DST" as well
dam i have no idea about any of this, and i live in the uk!
lol
Aw, I'm alone? :(
:P
only reason i know it's 3pm for me is i calculated the time on the countdown =D
I thought it was a given, since we're all here.
0can i request a vid to be streamed?
9pretty cool, thank ya kindly
Yes, I was being sarcastic
Well I meant you set "automatically set to DST" :P
GURREN HAX

Cold pizza is the best thing ever.
take them off!
lol
It was delicious.
cool guys don't look, am i right?
Olives tomatoes and peppers
tho there was a lack of slow motion
They really piled it on
i don't like tomatoes but the other 2 are nice
9Yeah it's Shinn, only he's really cool in SRW
Aw, those are GOOD veggies though
9IT'S ALL ABOUT POSITIVE INFLUENCE FROM CHARACTERS OF OTHER SERIES
Yeah, but they're all up in my pizza. Doesn't even taste like pizza anymore.
Aw, then it's not fun
9but yeah
9people actually called Kira and Assram on their bullshit, for one
9yeah
Yes, he meens shinji ikari
9this is the Z subseries
Filled with robots of every single mecha series.
9 AM EAST
EST*
Thanks you
On Saturday 17th
I can't keep all these different gundam continuities straight . . .
I don't know if I can forgive Shinji for being such a pussy in Evangelion
23 HOURS LEFT.
9Shinji wasn't a pussy
9he was 14
9he was still a brat
Yeah
*22*
He was a realistic character. Whether you like it or not.
9but in SRW
Evangelion is basically that, an 80s mecha made in the mid 90s.
0721:52 :)
No, but there was 0 character development. Not realistic
Hey
I still need to watch the End of Evangelion and the Rebuild Series of Evangelion.
9Shinji actually had positive role models
Granted, it's Evangelion was nothing special as people like to claim.
Everything happened all at once in the last episode, when it comes to character development. If you call that realistic, whoa boy.
awww this reminds me of a song
The rebuild series is actualy really good.
-it=s
Here's an AMV I made of it in two hours http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG2-XY6jYIM

OMG, Lelouch and C2!

Wait, isn't that the one with only bandai originals?
and "like every other 80
and "like every other 80's mecha protagonist", no
Just... no...
wait
9naw you're thinking of OG
9DAT BEAM CONFUSE
This battle seems pretty one-sided.
Lawl
9I'm just that good
9Does this remind you of anything?
lol
why is this show worth watching?
i tried watching the first ep but it wasn't very good
9which one?
yes
it does
i mean a lot of people are obsessed about it
9well the first two eps aren't very indicative of the quality
9 AM EDT (GMT-4)
9I'd recommend you to start with Ep 03 or 04
They did take a but to hit their stride
Tbh, I haven't heard him in anything else.
okay
for*
thanks for the tip
Episode 4 did it for me, try that one
9and it's also not for everyone
Thanks Espy :)
9even if it's liked by a lot of people
hi
bEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAMU
are they free-standing?
Episode 5 was the one that made me realize I cared about the characters.
And it's currently 11:14 AM EDT.
mostly freestanding
Mostly yes.
Free-standing for the msot part
24 HOURS REMAIN
They're slightly intertwined
They mostly stand on their own, yup
9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
there is some overarching plot, but it's not essential
I never had a problem with ep 1/2. Not as good as the others yeah, but I never thought them bad.
Oh look, Setsuna . . .
as long as you watch the first ep first, and last ep last, you're good
lol
9yeah I like the first two eps too
I swear it was 6 am in some timezones.
My only problem with the whole season is not enough Luna
9but they are not a good starting point for everyone
i'll drink some beer and watch them
thanks and bye!
The first 2 are great in my opinion, they are fun to watch.
Exactly, SilkAMV
17:15 here :D
hallo
shinji
Yes.
That stood out like a sore thumb.
Some people just don't want to acknowledge the difference between GMT and BST.
Me too, SilkAMV
I didn't check the whole thing, though
It's 4:15 pm in GMT though...
I don't find errors because I don't look for them.
and apparently it's 11:15 EDT now
Yes, yes it is.
You /sure/ you're in GMT right now?
Do you observe Daylight Savings where you are?
Because GMT /never/ changes due to Daylight Savings.
Seriously, Espy, the time zone is called GMT, their current time is BST :P
9there's an easy way to keep track of the time
9http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/eastern-time/
9when it's 9 AM there
9it's time for the ep
time zones screw me up, and I university theoretical maths >.>

Don't think there are
There are no translations yet for this one.
I keep missing Rarity

Hello, hello!
can you translate all of it?
Haha
9I just know to navigate themenus

....
neat
does this include robotech?
9it has Macross Frontier units
9so Sorta
9if you want Rick Hunter/Hikaru Ichijou

9if it existed
9I'd have it
2,14 lol
Oh, this isn't a lot.
9OG 1 and OG 2 were localized for the GBA
9and that's it
9it's enough to learn how to play though
We'll probably hit around 200+ users then.
9...If Garrod decides to charge up
wait how did he only take 10 damage
9yeah
9but he didn't decide to charge
2,14 wait? are you streaming now?

really now?
Thats awesome
9well if you don't count Tetsujin
Didn't expect to see SRW on here... I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
FUUUUUUUUUU-
Tetzujin is also in REDLINE. Suddenly I'm realizing how many references that movie has.

9SCOOTA BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

SSSSWWWWEEEEEETTTT!
9YES

My Japanese isn't all that good, and I don't remember much of Getter Robo
2,14 YES
2,14 BIG-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He is.
9he was
2,14 I have no idea how this universe is stable
He was
9he just died already
2,14 no universe could possibly be this awesome and not explode on itself
No he didn't :'(
9Val, there is Equestria
This universe runs on the power of Awesome.
9now if we gave Equestria mechs....
Why the SRW?
9FIN FUNNEL RAPE
DON'T the universe couldn'
t handle that
Fuun Saiki.
I've distilled an elixir of lead and pomegranate
Dunno. I just came for the SRW.
nearly fell asleep wearing my contacts
I came for the ponies
I'll be using Rainbow Dash SilkAMV
It's a shame SRW Z2 doesn't have such a kickass OST as OGS.
9Sig: you're now imagining Folka and Kyosuke in Z2
0my brother hates when i say "everypony" or "anypony" or "somepony"
Pinkie Pie is objectively best pony. :P
Hehe.
Alteisen was FTW.
No, it is Rarity
Lamia in Z2 would be awesome too.
0im going to start using all pony talk when talking to him.
2,14 you could say his effectiveness
uhh no
Still though- WTB moar translated SRW's.
2,14 *glasses*
2,14 got halved
Did you leave it on purpose? XD
9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Magneto?

I think everyone can agree on that one.
Magneighto
0he is a river serpent
magneto XD
his last name is magnet-

2,14 I thought I recognized him
:p
Hmm.. is Gundam Deathscythe in Z2?
"Gainer" or something?
or Sandrock?

9I just didn't deploy any Wing units
You're the player?
Where my Epyon at?
Alrighty, see you guys tonight then
Think you can show me a Giga Drill Breaker in a sec?
2,14 see you then
9indeed
Don't get me wrong, I think this looks awesome
9Giant Robo
9but then the creator died
Daitarn.
9and the copyright holders were a bitch
Yeah I know
9and didn't want it in any more SRW
You've told me :(
Always are.
Same reason why we don't get more translated SRWs.
I'd think the copyright holders would /want/ more money.
9it's the same with Eva
9if it wasn't for Anno
2,14 considering the idea BEHIND copyright is protecting the ideas of the individual responsible
9Eva wouldn't have made it into SRW
Yeah, but the company doesn't like asking for copyrights lmao.
SRW fans to stingy copyright holders: "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
9*WILL NOT
They made Shinji not a bitch.
9I've told them the story
He went from a crybaby in Evangelion to a cool person in SRW.
2,14 don't think I've seen this ship before
9Rejectan Instrumentalitan, Telling Gendou to fuck his shit uppan
I take it you don't agree, Pontang
9it was more like
9he went from normal person in Eva/Alpha 1
Oh no, I liked the fights. =s
lol I can't tell :P
Yeah, that.
9Pontang only likes reals
Yeah, animations are awesome sometimes in Eva
I have this song on my computer.
Transformers would be under Real Robots, yes?
=3
Hmmm..
9that's a tough call
I'm not sure.
I respect that some people do, but I just can't
0in order to wake up for movie night
9nah Sig
the real reason people watched evangelion was all the nude scenes.. and the music
9they're kind of Gunda-Bing
9*Gundam-Big
srsly
I'll be back
My memory's failing me-
9Brain Powerds are reals according to J
RObots.
9SRW J
I suppose it annoys me when people hail it as the greatest anime 'evar'.
Ohhh, cool
9their stats are Real-type
Stat-wise they'd be reals, yeah.
Really rarely @ Valthe
no I'm getting them too
Eva is NOT the greatest anime ever
Same here, Pontang
2,14 oh okay
I much prefer Gurren Lagann over Evangelion.
But I suppose it's inevitable
it's more of a Character Study
9Getter is too much POWER OF EVOLUTION for the stream to handle
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-kia-rage.jpg
2,14 lol
That's why Z2 is awesome.
the reason i haven't and most likely won't watch evangelion is the nude scenes
I enjoyed Gundam Wing a lot, too, though I know it's not as good as some other Gundams
9Wing was bland as fuck for me
The robots were just really nice, though
Ehh, it's not as bad as SEED.
9well it's hard to be as bad as SEED
That's all I can say about it.
One of my favorite mechs
SEED Looked cool, but I heard it kinda blows hardcore.
9G is great
Damn...
Am I a bad person for liking 00 Gundam?
Or did they ditch that in Z2?
9Getter is fucking shit up
Well, there's plenty of other Gundams to watch
SilkAMV: it's not bad at all.
9Sig: he does have them
No, SilkAMV
9it's just ahrd to see on the mugshot
Is Domon Kasshu in z2?
Gundam 00 is the only one that caught my attention at all
2,14 though he's gona need to get a resupply soon
I mean the bigger ones.
Why didn't people like it?
That's like.. not attached to his face.
Not exactly my favorite mech series, but really good I thought
9Gette is pretty much the precursor of Eva
lol some Gundam fans are VERY picky about their Gundams, SilkAMV
Getter is cooler though.
9DERP
9I mean
Simply 'cuz of old time's sake.
9Gurren Lagann
hello?
But yeah, after I watched L-GAIM, I was hooked on Tomino.
I've pretty much only heard crap about how bad Wing is, which is why I tend to mention that I like it :P
:D
when is next stream/
SilkAMV: many mecha do sadly.
?
2,14 the next BMN is 7PM EST today
uk time?
9GaoGaiGar is great
9specially supers
I did tell him to eat my ex-boyfriend's choe actuallty
*actually
Which BlazBlue, crono_flash?
Use faith on getter 'fore he dies, lol.
*chode
9Garrod y u no charge Satellite Cannon?
2,14 BIG-O!!!!! ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9also I gotta do some Homework after this LOL
I can play either of the PSP games
9long stage is long
Aw, I only have PS3 version
Haha, was kinda hoping for a fight, there :P
it's his PSP
Hmm.
I don't even have a PS3 yet:P
He has his PSP hooked up
9PSP + Remotejoy
9no good PSP emulators yet
This irc...
lol
That's a shame.
And hello :D
I'd grab SRWZ2 but my PSP's a bitch.
:)
Hi!
Analog nub's f00ked.
SEASON 2, LESS THAN 24 HOURS
'Lo.
MY BODY IS READY
9you don't need analog for Z2
9Wow
I know-
But it's fucked as in it keeps moving left.
I'll be back later, catch everyone at the pre-show
<-- has no CFW.
I actually have to buy all that crap.
Well, not since 10 minutes ago
9Flutteryay: tomorrow we'll air the two movies back to back
MOOOOOOOOOOOON
xfd
damn

Pony, Gurren Lagann and Getter Robo.
Touche!
9oh
9RIGHT after the premiere
9I'm streaming Mazinkaiser SKL
And a few million other mecha things, too!
A friend linked me here. Said that there were robots.
We're here in case there's a 200 person limit
07there is no 200 person limit here
I did not.
It's when they clear out the clouds
The things I saw were pretty cool, though.
Oh I see
I saw it.
You mean at Rainbow Dash's introduction?
At the very end
9something like that
9LASTO SHOOTINGU
I prefer robots, but I'm still sticking around for the S2 premiere.
"Frank Sinatra has finished downloading." Oh, fuck, yeah.
9dat Scopedog
Scopedog used to be Scope Doggy Dogg
They are loved
2,14 that is correct crakcerjack
xD
:D!
You've got SRW.
'nuff said.
Hello, how is everyone doing today?
Hey IrOnLoRe, pretty good.
This stream is 99% hot blooded and 1% manly tears
Two separate streams for maximum damage?
LQ is for mules
Manly Tears.
9wow the stream is really behind

Crakcerjack: Yup
:awwyeah:
9brb refreshan
Dai-Gurren.

Yeah.
Dai-Gurren rocks!

Used by every TTGL pilot.
Hmm…I see we're watching more robots.
If you want I can link you it later.
Quite good, quite good.

It keeps stopping every few seconds
Huh? no.
Not for me.
I'm not getting it. "The stream is currently offline"
Huh, 99,800 health eh?

I don't want to be tempted
Try refreshing, Jessim?
I set it to low quality, and now it's fine
I'M A NICE GUYYYYYYYY

Yeah.
07wrong
^

2,14 Tek: live
it's called Melting Pot of Alcohol
SRWz2
Lol.
too bad they dont have the hub on UK TV
Or in this case, an UMD.
CRITICAL
Ha, no.
It looks too high res for GBA
PSP.
PSP
looks like PSP graphics
Oh, makes sense.
this game's cutscenes are awesome... if only it was in engrish ;_;
It's for the PSP.
my screen says that the broadcast is offline
boastbusters
A cool one.
winter wrap up
Switch to low quality ^
Mib, try watching on LQ.
trixie <3
Low quality just shows a cartoon playing :P
Can you fuse Dai-gurren with Gurren Laggan to make Tengen toppa?
I haven't seen boast busters in a while.
I'll watch that one.
valt I did and it still says it
9yeah the LQ Stream ain't live
Z2's part 1 of Gurren Lagann.
The next one's been said to do TTGL S2 though, with TTGL.
2,14 you'll have to /quit and relog with a different name
Maybe even STTGL
Or you could use /nick?
alrighty, thanks
nice
2,14 that's why
Anyhow, I'm going to bail now.
Later, everyone.
2,14 use www.bronystate.net
9wow
Wrong site mib_se1x83 .
for some reason I can't stand gundam
9that was...nice, Chirico
9a lot of damage for a Real
why is the stream stopping ever few seconds?
Not a a clue.
aha, name changed
yesh
you might be able to get him to half health before noon.
It stops every now and then for me as well. It's normal most likely due to the increased volume of users.
that sludge monster... he just wont die
9because the popout ain't live
9not yet at least
lolmegas
Haha :P
2,14 especially because that means Glorft would be fightable enemies :P
Megas just needs to press the 'win' button...literally
Not only for AOE attacks
ALL ATAACKS
*attacks
Every time an enemy survives he just hits the next button
For missile attacks "Fire Missiles" "More Missiles" "Even MORE Missiles" "FIRE ALL THE MISSILES!"
moar dakka
Heh
His fists also shoot guns and missiles.
When do the ponies start? just asking.....
As do his feet...or any part of his body.
9oh wow the sstream caught up
Aquarion

07Val's provider is derpy net ;)
Hmm, I get a couple skips here and ther actually.

Getting some hiccups here too.
9SuperBrony64: THANKS FOR TELLING ME
He's crossing the streams!
Yeah getting some random pauses as well.

bazillion missiles come at you, and you take a step back, and take no damage, even though everything in a mile radius is turned to glass
XD
LOL HE MISSED
Do they have Gunsword?
Haha: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/58869

*click*
Damn you slow connection!
9he just SHOOTS TWICE AND HITS ON THE THIRD SHOT
9it's just his style
Next time Nadesico is in a SRW they should have Gekiganger 3 as an actual unit.
ahaha
Kayube, FUCK YES!
Nadesico's crew + Gurren Laggan
does that thing have a massive sword cawk?
when's season 2 a'coming
I had a tooth pulled earlier and the gause is bugging me something fierce
derp
'lo
i need to get a fill in
but i am afraid of needles
I know the feeling
I just close my eyes really tight and imagine the poking is a bee
gahhhh i am afriad of bees too!
imagine a wasp then
Their in my eyes!
lol that is a good one^
jk I respect bees
The topic in this channel is gonna make me scrap
2,14 that's the one thing keeping me from going to Japan
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLCbS02T1Y
/me shivers
Lol Val
; D
wasps are even worse than bees!
9time to finish this
end it!
Yeah they've practically taken over Tokyo, Val :P
>has never been stung
2,14 GET THEM OFF ME! I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ON ME
wow
2,14 AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2,14 well, I've never been stung either
lol i would run away flaling my arms and screaming
2,14 but I'm deathly afraid of it
If you leave them alone, they won't do anything to you.
:P
/me adds to his list
/me 2,14 is going to murder you dari
i have never been stung either, but also horribly afraid of them
Dari, Japanese Bees are huge
Sure
2,14 I'm not afraid! I have my +9 Trident of Hornet Repelling
2 inch wingspan
It's not fun. I've had an entire nest swarm my face.
Besides anything that evolved in Australia, those things are high on my list of horrors to avoid at all costs
You can probably see them on wikipedia
Don't look at this, Val http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/gianthornet2.jpg
I have gotten stung before, it's not that bad only hurts for like a sec.
Those things look evil
>2 inch wasp
beest
the stream is lagging on my end...
IDC about them.
they looks sooooo evil
2,14 yeah well, you're forgetting about the venom dari
9gonna restart the stream and try streaming something else, k?
yes
Average.
finish off this boss first
Though I agree that bees and such aren't anything to be afraid of
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4MqTCIDKhU
This man disagrees, RP
Hornets you need to fear
I keep getting dropped
When is the times for preshow requests?
Unless you happen to be alergic.
2,14 which is why I'm terrified dari :P

Framerate is crap because I'm doing a lot of shit.

really, I don't expect the movie to be TOO unbearable. At least it's not "The Princes Promenade"
Pretty sure I did download it.
Don't play with vital airbubbles like that!
shoo be doo
07hmm which browser are you using atm?
07chrome?
Be glad it's just G1 and not G3 or worse... G3.5
I didn't even know gen 1 existed until now, an i am glad. No offense to you ponies out there.
SHUSH
G3.5 WAS NEVER MADE
no, it do not believe in magic!
Get ready for that.
:>
/me is ready
Rainbow Dash is based on her
She has to be awesome
Yeah.
already ready!
G3.5 never happend! >.>
G3.5 did happen.
3.5?
shoo be doo
snititai I'm afraid it did
Not for long though.
IT CANT SEE US IF WE CANT SEE IT
I know v.v
3.5 is canon
Is RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE G3 or G3.5?
3.5, uh
ug
canon?
3.5 needs to be shot out of a cannon
sixthegate look up "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
both actually
okai ill look it up
Here's all you need to know about 3.5:
Heck yeah, Samarai jack.
Magic apple sword.
don't watch it
ever
Yes.
but a silly pony wielding a magic apple...
I don't think that G2 even had a show (although I could be wrong on that)
Watch all of it.
thank goodness that Pinkie Pie is a sugar fiend
Yeah.
G4: BEST DAY EVER
http://mylittlewiki.org/w/images/9/9b/Untitled-10.jpg
G2, followed by G3 and 3.5 and Newborn Cuties
G3.5 somehow DUMBER than G3.
?
on the list for worst
...*Tilts head*Whats this...
but G2 is the least watching for me
Rainbow Dash was the fashion pony.
G3.6 NEWBORN PONIES. nuff said
Put all my stat points into STR?
what's the difference between G3 and G3.5?
Rainbow Dash always dresses in Style
lol
G3.5 the ponies are, um
worse looking
*G3.5*
hey guys guys hey

hello there
Blasphemer. Nothing is cuter than G4 Applebloom.
pony tits
usually, 3.5 is just called 'crap'
Pacman
newborn cuties though is worse
damn right ntonio9 :P
got me a full minute to realize
An actual horse must look like a freaking viking to these ponies.
for a good recap of the non-FIM generations, check out this: http://miburl.com/HDqnAC

a lot of people have the wrong addresses
is audio going to be off during streaming?

By Pinkiepieswears
LUNA

Alright, identified!
/me prances about proud to have his name
hi everypony!
I got something
the stream is lagging
I know the stream is lagging.

My ISP is being stupid.
FallSilently: Nah.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGTuXIqf880

Maybe there are too mane people watching?
how do i get the chatbox and the stream to be next to eachother, not one above the other?
07nah
"CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS MY LITTLE PONY!"
*many
Luna
You ready now?
are they stream something from the cartoon network?
07I took over ;)
goddamnit I'm doing it subconciously now.
just irc.ponychat.net
6Luna is now in control~
Hurray for Luna!
2,14 she is...*glasses*....assuming control
If anything from cartoon network, let it be dexter's laboratory
:D
hurry
i mena
hurray
yeaaaaaaaaaah
try something else
IN DEXTERS LAB
Haven't seen Dexter's in more then 6 years I think :P
I did
07yes it is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGTuXIqf880
The fact that I like this show was even further clarified in the faust interview with EQ daily.
Dexter's Laboratory was the best
ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
Are you taking requests Luna?
like fluttershy.whatever
also Ed,Edd and Eddy that was a legend show
woo, i *love* this song!
07not yet
Just read that interview :P
Luna isn't in control yet for me.
<3 this song
there's a music vid for this? YEAH
okay that's not it
I am getting something totally different
lawl rawl
07there is no limit
Brilliant
DAMNIT SEAON 2 WHY U NO COME QUICKER
...1.2 gigaviewers?
Wait Luna is a "reaper"?
LAGS
zaco_mobile: is a reason for disconnection/no connection given? Like timeout or something?
I hope there won't be any lags tomorrow :/
LAAAAAG
make it stop!
Or does my connection just suck?
my flatmate asked me waht i was singing (my shower singing was kinda infamous in the flat)
2,14 we're switching streamers in a second
sorry has blade runner been on or am i early?
Saturn how did you like germany?
this is lagging becaue someone is donwloading piracy movies
And te vertical?
ARGH
timing out
she was amused, but thought i was silly and, to her credit, tried the show, but didn't like it
/me goes to get an Arizona Tea
I can see it :P
The sound of beeps?
Saturn i wish we already had this show
Gig: it's being CDN'd
zaco_mobile: You could try increasing the timeout time. I see some Verizon users had to do that. There are mixed claims of Verizon blocking all common IRC ports or filtering the traffic somehow. I'm not really sure though.
mib_ocxusq, blade runner is later
you mean it won't work for Canadians?
LUNA

It exists in our minds...
