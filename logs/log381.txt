/me shudders
well, Fluttershy is making friends with mine
http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v31/Connor/?action=view&current=IMG_0098.jpg
damn
That fluttershy is so damn incorrect.. it upsets me.
That is awesome and horrifying at the same time.
FLUTTERSHY IS NOT RAINBOW DASH.
also, empty milk bottle in the background :D
lol
I'm gonna go, guys.
:3
I want to know who makes the damn MLP FiM toys.
later
and slap them in the face for inaccuricies
bye CrossChop114
Cya CrossChop114
all I see on the packaging of that particular Fluttershy is Hasbro, so... Hasbro
dashie its hasbro
whats so innacurate about it?
CountDoofus, im jelly of the Fluttershy figure...
i didnt see anything wrong
upon closer look, her mane is shorter than it should be, and there's no cutie mark on the left flank
other than that, it's... nice
:\
anyone else remember Lion King?
is any one else like me and trying to known every single line in the entire show? http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Transcripts/Friendship_is_Magic,_part_1

ofna01: The song was leaked before the episode came out -.-
:)
i heard it before it came out and thought it was fake
i know TOY
it was leaked almost half a year before the actual episode even
makes me wonder howlong it takes to make 1 episode
i understand CCC cuz they usually do small little songs,not full-lengths
Ugh no matter the song is still awesome
I dont look for spoilers.... :\
No one can argue with that
or look for leaks

It's Wrek playing happy wheels
lol put a pony in this game D:
08,01also i've listened to Smile 6 times today
We do, Wrek runs on spam.
dat blood
yeah, we totally need a pony character
lol
they need a happy wheels client download so we can get skins so we can have santa pony.
Snakeeeeees: NO.
just
....that would be way more awesome than it should be
no
I would not like ponies in this game
why the hell is there random levels in my favorites?
Pinkie Pie needs to be in this game
i only have favorited 1
The death of a pony would be antibrony
but optional client with skin capability would be fine
she would not get hurt though
yes
Having fun Wrek?
wow.....
D:
oh shut up you
this is messy

Toodles RaveBrony
i got bored after my 30 day trial
:|
:\
i never bothered playing it, i played free mmo's instead and got bored that way
the games okay
Be careful with spotify, if you play music from spotify in here
i just dont like the style
The game is good
LOL
The community is crap
strean is back
It's illegale
would someone link me to the game?
this song is epic
Illegal*
Fuuuuu, if Wrek is drawing, im not leaving....
what?
DOSE' EYES
rarity?
No
Well said RaveBrony
no
vinyl?
Vinyl I think
pffff, rarity he says
Probly
ofna01 /facepalm
vinyl ?
looks like vinyl
red eyes
Has anyone played " I wanna be the Boshy" ? its like I wanna be the Guy 2.0
^^
same hair
/me puts bits on Vinyl
Aka: DJ- P0N-3
Hair colours says vinyl
how can you mix up rarity and vinyl
Ragnalock - ignore the hair?
/me puts more bits than The_4th_Wall.
AKA BEST DJ EVER
I don't need bits to win bets :3
they're effectively the same if they're both bald
I'm back
ignoring the hair ill accept your point MirrorImage
*Generates 1 million bits out of nowhere*
good morning everyone!
Welcome back otakon
also, who's drawing?
Wrek
and you just KNOW that Pinkie Pie has some hair removing tonic somewhere for a prank
ohai otakon
n way
Wrek us drawing
i love how everyone is calling her mane hair
wrek. by now you shoudl recognize his style
Hey otakon.
/me folds, gets a fake id, then bets triple ThatsAShinySky
Dark_Horst: that's NOT his style, hes trying something new it seems
/me gets more bits that even exist. Take that The_4th_Wall!
you think?
oh hell yeah
i'd say it looks quite similar to his other lineworks
I can tell by the eyes alone
yeah, he said it himself, he tried something new
pixal art is what that is
/me breaks himself, fetches Pinkie.
pixel* rather
pixel art is good
but only good from a distance
Other times, I'm pretty sure he's been doing vector art
No lie, a tear just dropped out of my eye.... out of jealousy of Wrek.... :(
it's looking really good so far, seems more detailed then his usual stuff
/me "Pinkie, do your worst"
wonder who that green pony is... Myra?
Yeah, pixelart looks really good when in high quality
especially the mane. i like the mane
Lyra*
/me eats a cupcake. NONMONONMOONM

i exited this too quickly, and now it exists twice
I had to go through the backyard pitchblack last night
the bag I just linked
Fazana: Big backyard?
Yep
Well -squee- :P
If you've not fallen asleep in history, in the medieval times, people would have large strips for farming
like a quarter of a mile long
Dark_Horst: asp
Fazana: and yet you were capable of returning to the house without lighting aids?
I have one of those for a garden
He likely knows the way around
Lightning aids? Interesting..
I can see the house, but not what I was headed for
....oh hey, voldemort's in the music biz now?
so much lag :'(
I had to close the scootaloo coop
my interest is awakened
08,01sooo tired
08,01lightning AIDS
I dont have a backyard So I wouldnt know....
dat detail
08,01the fastest AIDS in the west
this picture is amazing
ohh i missread Jim
08,01you can tell i'm going kinda loopy
Dat Blitz AIDS
whatever he's doing different, he should do it more often
Burn the aids

/me wants borderlands 2
Huerry up mother, I want mah pancaik micks!
/me wants Guild Wars 2 NOW
You ain't got no pancake mix!
I WANT MAH PANCAKE MIX
Brooklyn Bounce = f- yeah
I am interesed in so many sequels this year, borderlands 2, guild wars 2, torchlight 2
Torchlight s having a sequel?
eeyup
with multiplayer
What is torchlight?
One minute
and why cant valve count to 3
05must say pixels are a nice break from vectors >3
what's tochlight?
Wrek: I like the new look, very nice
they can, they just won't yet...
It's a dungeon crawler game
looks really good wrek
oh
okay
sounds fun
This is how I feel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWizDna1XO4
Torchlight is a Diablo clone done BY the guys that helped make Diablo
it's pretty good
what's this program called, Wrek? and is it free? :$
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEJwjkm2UPw
It's NOT free
its adobe
however.
WHAT
did he move the screen
this is the viewfinder for the screen capture program
as in
I'm Guesing Guesing
did he delete vinyl, or
ThatsAShinySkyALT: probably a new layer
ok
Torchlight is amazing
And a sequel would be fab
ThatsAShinySkyALT: or his muse has struck him upside the head with a golden brick wrapped around a lemon and he's doing something else. it happenes
I WANT BORDERLANDS 2.
wait until Sept.
Gets boring soon enough, imo
the best part of torchlight 2 will be the multiplayer
Y7eah
guys, have you noticed, valve cant count to 3?
that'll prolong replayability
HL2, TF2, and so on
I'm guessing that wreks streaming
Yeah
I realised years ago
Episode 3 anyone?
nope
never happen
they cant count to 3
unless
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
Valve never put a three in any of there games
Also, for every hat you buy, Gabe has the authority to delay Ep3 for another week
its one of there motto's
speaking of TF2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
okay guys, I'll brb just doing something with Dark Souls
ThatsAShinySkyALT, Valve said they are releasing Half-Life 3, not Episode 3 though. (Can't remember source though)
:/
man... I wish I had a tenth of Wrek's talent
05im not talented
05its called practice
05you get nowhere iwth out it and dedication
You're gooood
I think that there should be a compition, where the winner gets to have something drawn by @Wrek
anyone know any speed stacking?
I've seen it once
I can speed stack pancakes
like once a month or something
I can also speed eat them
Jim im Team GB
im going Germany this year
suprise
;)
Cool ThatsAShinySkyALT :D
free journey.
I can also flip cars by hitting walls at 45 degree angles

mouse i think
Pootis - Heavie's own language
Secret butt fun
SUPRISE
Pootsets pootsets
BUTT SECK BUTT SECK BUTT BUTT BUTTT BUTT BUTT BUTT SECKS
i like bf3. it's an awesome game in itself. the problem is just the fluud of cod kiddies
sorreh
people who've never played a team-shooter before and now got attracted to BF because of the fancy looks
ikr dark?
I know right
i just unlocked the M1014 on there
I've seen people running around like madmen in BF3 with their rocketlaunchers
that does it. next paycheck, I'm getting me a drawing tablet, and some instructional books
the semi-auto shotgun
Eh, Battlefield look aight
crafter
But i'm more of a rpg fallout 3 kinda person.
ah
i swear to god i saw people climbing MOUNTAINS IN TANKS just to get at ONE RED DOT completely surrounded already by blue dots
that explains it
I'm not exactly a fan of the BF and the CoD series
HOW DOES A BRAIN WORK THAT WAY?
i have no clue
im a good jet pilot though
so.....who is drawing what?
i went 12-0 with only air-to-air clues
wrek is drawing
man i missed the jets
Wrek is drawing... a pony. who, can't tell yet
and drawiing a pony
neat
poneh
Pwny
Who needs any pony other than derpy....
i'd just like to know what they were thinking when they brought back the f35 with the addon and made it utterly worthless
Matilda!
Derpy is all i need @_@
we need dash Aircrafter
True that Ofna01
I would just Snuggle with Rarity
Dark
Derpy and Dash
and pinkie
That's all I need, and my life will be complete
when did they bring back the F-35?
yes?
in the addon
life would be boring without pinkie
back to karkand
ah
Derpy, Dash, and Big Macintosh.
i dunno what to have for lunch
Eeeyup.
Me and Rarity fit so well
What do you call a guy who gets destroyed? A. A Pwnee :P
BOOOO
but it's crap. the maneuverabilty and speed in dogfights is a joke. even it's bullets are slower that the mig's
pony_4080 you can change your name with /nick <yourname>
Dark
05who is this?
I know, but I'm not a chatter though...
i thought there was no difference?
Looks like Matilda to me
its rainbow dash
Wrek, idunnolol
there's a huge difference
its Dasheh
Berry punch?
It's flutterhsy
NOPE
Flutter?
not fluttershy
it's slower that the other jets and steers like a rock
Its a pony.
mhmm
my hunch is Rarity
I'm totally sure its a pony.
RD?
rarity,twi,or dash
Twi?
also you can't break and sharpturn becasue when you hit s it enters hover mode
It's Twilight
i've narrowed it down to those 3
dash
Dark
twi -.-
unicorn... so Rarity or Twilight
i play on an Xbox so
/me i wonder who will notice this
twilight
its twi
Wait
Ofna01: Dat xbox live?
unless a background pony
It MIGHT be Twixier
yep
whos the band?
Trixie*
bf3? on xbox? why you hurt yourself so much?
its either trixie or twi
whatcha mean Dark/
0,5OHAI :I
OHAI
heya LC
hi
How do LC
0,5Guys I reuploaded my artowrk from yesterday
Yeah, pls no Cantervoice, it scares Fluttershy
0,5Because i forgot the tails
ohai LC
the console version has way lower graphics, smaller maps and what was the player limit? 24?
Dark,i cant afford a good enough computer to play BF3 on PC
Laserpon3 and Vinyl?
0,5yep
heyhey
who's laserpon3?
holy crap, Owl City
OWL CIRY!
I love them
0,5A friend
CITY
i remember Fireflys
but 24 < 64. that alone is reaosn enough for the pc verssion, i'd say
0,5Also, here is my tumblr:
0,5http://lordcelestia.tumblr.com/
Who needs bloody CoD or Battlefield when you can play Quake, or Unreal?
i agree Dark
lol derpy day
granted i can't play on high either, but i don't really care. 64 players and all
Dark im actually making a mod to turn all vehicles on BF3 to jets
so flying tanks now?
but the jets are so hard to actually fly
no,it replaces them with jets
now they aren't
unfound their not even CLOSE to hard
if they're hard to fly, you have the wrong mosue senitivity
tweak that and everythings cool
try going 18-0 in a jet with only Air-To-Air kills
i play on my controller hooked to my pc
no mouse sensitivity
so shooting down other jets and helis
what?
Dark
whats your record for dogfights won on BF3?
in a single game
mine was 14
no idea. i'm an occasional pilot
Brb, gonna check if my pancakes are ready for creation yet
then i kiled 4 helis and boosted it up to 18
but my win ratio in jets was 3:1
at leats in the early day. then the veteran pilots came and i learned a whole new appreciation for the ground B)
: )
wish i could get any BF.
i got most of my practice on BF play4free
like BFBC2
Shiny
does it have aircraft?
you ever play Battlefield Play4Free?
no
:|
BFBC2 at least not
Play4Free is basically Bad Company 2
I'm off for a while, gonna do some more Assassin's Creed
ttfn
cya
See ya CountDoofus
Bye CountDoofus
cya CountDoofus
Ooh a LoL update! :))
lol
lol @ LoL
but if you want an actual battlefield, i advise you to get something that's not bad company
FFS.
Battlefield 2
all bad rotatiobn.
bad company was a lot more action balanced than tactics
what really bugged me was that you couldn't lie down
im gonna have to reset my modem real quick
brb
ill be back in 5 minutes
cya for now
I'm back
bye
Bloody pancake mix isn't ready
/me rages
that alone took the pacing more into a COD direction
why is your pancake mix bloody?
I dunno
Blame mother
o_O
But mainly( Bloody = expletive)
Well...Guess the chats gonna go quiet for a bit.
i'd guess he's british. bloody seems to be their damn
im hungry.
Not really. :P
then teach me wisdom
Dark_Horst usually we use damn more than blooduy
I am British
Same.
then why have bloody?
bloody*
i use bloody when damn isnt strong enough
In the earlier British times though, people would derp if you said damn
Derpy approves
damn < bloody < fucking?
They would be more familiar with "Bloody"
I WANT THIS SONG SO BAD
I use bloody less than damn, less situations that it works
SONG NAME
I use it when it makes sense
._.
I rarely use damn
whats the song name?
I tend to use bugger
yeah as do i thats they it works less than damn
ThatsAShinySkyALT: use spotify
I hjave spotify.
yeah bugger is a good one
is it just me or does wreks new technique take considerably more time?=
05hows that?
wrek
pretty
whats the song?
not this one
the other one u played
05i dunno its random
:(
05using spotify radio
i have arrived
and now we shall never know
Don't kill me for this, but for some reason, this picture strikes as suggestive. O_e
Dreams crushed, Princess Trollestia Approves.
sorry if i took awhile,i made a sandwhich.
ofna01's here everyone hide :p
suggestive is not uncommon for wreks pictures
/me hides
/me noms sandwhich and looks around
where is everyone?
here
/me is trying not to laugh
/me hops out "Surprise!"
I like suggestive, it makes me realize how horrible I am.
/me chokes on sandwhich
I'm not bothered, but I felt like I had to say it.
Think I overdid it?
Rarity needs a last name... Or a signature with 2 letters.
No, but nothing scares me really
/me is still choking
Jim: Nah he'll be fine....Uh...Ofna o.o
/me poking ofna with a stick
/me takes stick and breaks it,still choking
liking suggestive isnt something to feel bad about Aircrafter
The only thing that scares me, is something that scares everyone
well i dont think so
Less stick poking more heimlich manevuer
Fazana: death?
Thank you Kwaklad.
No.
Taxes?
Nope.
/me looks at jim with a look that says,"finally someone with a brain"
Think about a certain kid singer.
Justin Beaver?
Or he SOUNDS like a kid anyway
/me uses the heimlich maneuvre on ofna01
You are afraid of fridays?
Breath darn it
ohh
/me spits sandwhich chunk in aircrafters face
oops
i dont care about fridays, what happened too thursday?
Thursday is boring
thursday came after wednesday
/me throws it back down Ofna01's throat-
But I'm gonna be bored for quite a while D:
Why?
/me looks at Aircrafter with an,"oh you bastard" look
Since I won't be going to my friends for a while
/me Troll Face
How come Fazana ?
/me slaps the troll face off Aircrafters face
I said yesterday, but not everyone was here, so I'll say it agai
/me isnt choking anymore
/me "Aww...." forever alone face
/me troll face
/me smacks troll face off Ofna01
I got a text yesterday saying that one of my friends has broken his leg in a crash at my mates house in his racing car.
hi
dat picture need moar ponys
Dayum
is he ok Fazana?
Yeah
Who's streaming
I'm not exactly feeling convenient of breaking my legs until any safety measures are made
Well word is he only broke the leg so im assuming mostly
does any 2 people here actually know each other irl?
Sadly, it's gonna be a mircle if it makes a full recovery
Ahh
my apologies Faz
Fazana: Miracles happen every day. I hope he gets better.
oh i love this song
like an oceaan
i have no answers for youuu
I go...You stay..
/me wonders why the eye is all black
If he doesn't recover fully, I'm gonna make sure he gets his leg amputated, because quite frankly, I want him to get his arse back in that car
because its not finished
where do you go,are you looking for answers?
can anyone tell me whos streaming
Wrek
ahh, thanks
lol, also no school on tomorrow and only 5 classes on thursday
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e7N0F4sPQ8
"only"
yea
if a broken leg doesnt heal fully it doesnt mean it is simply unusable Fazana frankly it would be harder to get around with a leg missing than with a duff leg
we have 7 usually then
sorry for posting during a stream,but some people dont like drawing
7? How long?
We have 4 hour long lessons
each is usually 45 mins
wow

Four one hour lessons

/me laughs
I don't need weapons to face the world
/me is back after extensively failing
What did The_4th_Wall fail at?
resisting pinkie die?
For one, not breaking
You know, except from breaking
your just a player in this matrix,you've got the basics,but will you survive throughout the ages?

(Hill needs visitors, after all
but i found a few
i think you guys have an F-4 right?

Also at hill, we have a B-17 Flying Fortress, an SR-71C Blackbird, an A-10 Thunderbolt II, a B-1B Lancer, a B-52G Stratofortress, and one of the first operational F-16 Fighting Falcon

Oh well, more Bronystate for me
Jim,look at that eye

tell me that doesnt look real
ENTER?
oh my, that's so good
that looks
EYYUP
whoa.
Anyway, why is there a giant eye on my screen?
4th
i may have to go there just to sit in an F-14
if you guys have one
i think the SR-71 and Lancer are open to get in
O____O
SR-71?
seriously?
Warning: text wall
i saw an SR-71 at an airshow recentley
wall worth reading
dAT EPIC EYE....
i agree 4TH
so i guess we can all agree its twi?
Who's drawing?
Wrek
It could be Octavia, hmm?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI

CupcakeWarrior: You were hugely mistaken

IS THAT A B-2 Stealth Bomber?
whos hostin now
Oh, yeah, we do a LOT of maintenance and avionic upgrades
pic page 2? yeah
recently completed modifications on the aircraft's nozzle bay doors to eliminate cracking.
thats a damn F-22
O_O
most high-tech plane on earth
One of the most expensive fighters
http://www.hill.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/thumbnails160/051207-F-2673Z-110.jpg
that F-16 seems a little weird..
the angle of the bend of the elevators
seems a little lower then normal F-16's
We have F-16's and JAS Gripens at our airbase
Jim,check out the pic,see if anything is weird to you
>goes to pony chat
those little "wings are part of the refuel boom
>sees discussion of planes
well,the wings seem like their bent slightly up
SAAB aircraft? neat
yeah. that's the boom
not those,the wings on the plane
oh.
Hi again.
Stabilators
hmm, it doesn't look that strange to me
the actually wings,the ones with flaps and airleons
pitched for climb
guess its just my imagination
hey guys just got back from college
Welcome back alexxm
trailing or leading edge of the wing?
well,the whole thing
qwho's streaming
it looks like their slightly bent upwards
boom's plaing trick
its probably just me
0,5What is Wrek drawing?

spakle*
SPARKLE*
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/F-14A_Tomcat_over_Iraq_during_Southern_Watch.jpg/300px-F-14A_Tomcat_over_Iraq_during_Southern_Watch.jpg
dat F-14
my favorite plane
cant believe the last deployment was 2006
hey everypony
The F-35's electronic warfare systems are intended to detect hostile aircraft first, which can then be scanned with the electro-optical system and action taken to engage or evade the opponent before the F-35 is detected.[198] The CATbird avionics testbed for the F-35 program has proved capable of detecting and jamming F-22 radars.[204]
Crap!
when is the F-35 supposed to go into service?
I think I have a stomach flu:(
arent they still developing it?
F-35 can JAM the F-22 radar
that sucks CupcakeWarrior

O.O
What is this? Someone drawing Twilight or Berry Punch?
A...a clop fiction?
this is getting too much realistic
Whats a...Clop...Fiction?
O.O
O_O
Aircrafter: You don't want to know

you dont wanna know Iwubponiez
05clopfiction: stories written to arouse
we will tell you when you are older XD
ewwwwwwwww
Iwubponiez: listen to an Azekahh reading and youbwill know
why do clop fics even exsit
This is boring. Bye guys. :p
stories written to arouse which are about characters in the western animated show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
rule 34 alexxm
arousing by READING?!?!?!?!??!
have a clinical definition.
rain : i am a big pony (there is no applebloom face :()
alexxm: trolling, rule 34
cya CrossChop114
you guys are sick...........
KetaminaDianePie: Just ask Twilight Sparkle
hahahaha
because some people need stories and pics dont do it for them XD
furthermore, why does RPing exist?
those eyes and smile remind me of creepy doll song
i get that but they're not even human like in the first place
yaaaay i love this song!
also, is this twilight? if probably is because twilight is best pony.
berry punch?
in fact, by extension, how did I somehow manage to get myself involved in an erotic one?
I think it's Twilight
Twilight is no 2 on my list
Twilight is indded best pony:$
damn rendering taking 1000 years
indeed*
Been drawing OneTrickPony ?
cupcakewarrior who's number 1 ?
ya
I filmed it and it took forever to render
Iwubponiez: Rainbow Dash of course!
well duh :P
actually i got 2 ponies in my number 1 can't decide
oh god, it's DashWithRainbows
everypony hide
Rainbow Dash is 4th on my list :S
protect your flanks
The drawing looks like a clown now
...
/me jumps behind the sofa to hide
lol
Bar the windows!
clown run
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1329803541566.jpg
those eyes are very realistic imo
ScootaChicken whats so bad about DashWithRainbows
ScootaChicken, does this rag smell like chloroform to you?
4chan->nope
alexxm Everything.
Inglip knows
rain WOW
oh it is /mlp/
ekips dnt worry its just a pic
alexxm: you have no idea...
DashWithRainbows: yes.
yes it does.
Oh okay.
yeah, i thought it would be some /b/ stuff, didnt see the /mlp/
I would never post anything unsavory here
what has he done
Thought I could smell lemons.
Combustible lemons
alexxm he's joking because we're both british and do this all the time to each other.
i'm british as well
careful of Bail lemons
oooooo.oooooo

ScootaChicken My little stalker: Murder is magic.

/me bets that is Wrek singing :3
i don't know if there's any bronies near where i live
there are
you just have to look
yeah
any of you guys live in croydon
the problem is whether there are LOTs or few and how motivated they are to meet
I'm pretty sure there are none where I live.
This video makes me feel like a bad artist
sorry alexxm
I'd like to finally meet a brony in my area >.<

Damn Wrek that must suck
13this year is very abnormal winter for us... usually by now there's at least a foot of snow und highs in the lower 20s
yeah... there isnt much snow here in canada right now... not where i live anyway
flutter_spin: It's only temprarly, he's drawen a mane
brb again guys need to get my potpie
:o
05CupcakeWarrior, nope, cause you get used to it, and you build your society around it.
13that whole air current thing in november probably screwed it up for all of us... no snow at the start of the season translating to no snow at the end or something
05for instance houses are basically cold proof
cold proof all the houses
poor people in Russia beg to differ
05im sitting in my room with no heating, got roughtly 25C in here
:o
Wow, lol
Roses are red, violets are blue, i suck at poems, gonna go play skyrim
you live in Sweden, right Wrek?
/me doesnt know Celsius
05concrete ftw
I'm trying to pick a bowler hat
and I'm stuck between two
okay I'm back guys wat's going on?
wow awesome
CupcakeWarrior: 25 degrees Celsius = 77 degrees Fahrenheit
talking about the weather
is he using a table or a mouse?
*tablet*
and what Wrek is saying is why England sucks, similar latitude so we should have similar weather all the time but, gulf stream means warmth, and suddenly english people are idiots and are terrified of snow (when driving) and dont build houses with cold in mind
me thinks tablet atm
sorry bout the wall
TABLET OR MOUSE
/me shrugpony
Tablet
what kind?
Bamboo -something- i think :o
A tablet would be nice to have I guess
wacom bamboo gotcha

guys
i have one :p but its about 10 yr old and when new only got £30
who should i do a BG with?

which pony?
its terrible insensitive

Everything you know is a lie, now go to sleep

Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
Jim: that would make sleep a lie as well
Live to Win I think
the cake is a lie
everything you know is wrong
08,01shizu: well, he's said he's sorry
The cake is a recipe. the result is a lie

Paradise92: Did they give a release date?
:S
08,01Paradise92: i know this is kinda pedantic, but can you keep things a bit more single liney?
08,01Paradise92: i mean, can you not redundantly add newlines?
08,01it's not a channel rule or anything, it's just... annoying to see

Paradise92: thanks I was wondering where it was
i feel loved also slow type HAVE to use right hand only to type

but there is somewhere were they had chose fluttershy vs TS
who here thinks we should form our own nation
stare off
thumb kills when i pull it the bone seems to go all over the place
ouch man
AwsomeNick: you set yourself to go to a doctors?
not sure if that's a good idea... look at Kickassia, didn't work out well
and it's spazzing a tiny bit
o_o
alexxm be careful what you say, cia could be everywhere :o
^
I'm waiting for my vid to render; better make a meme about premiere taking forever http://i41.tinypic.com/rtgh8h.jpg
nope i live with one LOL
thats where i got the idea Count Doofus and ekips i'm british
but in our hearts, we're all Equestrains
apparentyly it just needs rest so hush now my left hand is sleeping
(too cheesy?)
besides i'm sure we're a lot saner than the nostagila critic
is wrek drawing?
uhuh
many people think of us otherwise
otakon
yh?
first leak of fluttershy coming to you via pm :D
too late
already saw it
and it wasn't TS it was pinkie pie
just THE STARE
speaking of which, Nostalgia Critic has a new video out, gonna watch that :)
that didn't seem to do ANYTHING
he does? sweet
05argh my wrist
yea he reviewed ponyo otakon
ponyo sucks
get the cream wrek has carple tunnel!
05shittiest name for an ingury ever
Wrek: it's a sign to take a break man
go stretch your legs and such
indeed
SONOFABITCH!!!!!! NC is reviewing Ponyo!
i agree you been drawing for too long
you know go for a walk set some haters on fire
Wrek: no really, take a break man. You don't want to end up giving yourself a permanent injury or some such right?
You should probably stop Wrek
,
A tenosynovitis can take your hand out for weeks
better get some rest
wrek are you even reading
Paradise92: I SAW THE STARE MY GOD IT'S SO OP!!!
Fluttershy's stare?
still love this song
also otakon
other communities would yell "i want stream, go on stream", but not this :)
/me throws a shoe at otakon "No allcaps!"
/me dodges thrown shoe
<3
/me catches the shoe like a ninja
otakon Fluttershy isn't op...what are you talking about?
Nah, Fluttershy's stare isn't powerful enough, it needs to be buffed
Rain, silly filly that's for NewDCD
otakon it is her stare dude :)
Rain is throwing shoes again
weird song
I know man, DAMN it needs some kind of limit or something
DCD might be the shoe king but Im the shoe chucker
/me throws shoe back at rain
/me catches it with a smile
now everyone is throwing shoes
otakon i think it will be her Super 3 :)
/me throws another shoe
like half hp down
or something like that
Pear fight!
but still
/me arms himself with a size 13 boot
Paradise92: good balance I think
/me kicks it back at ofna01
well it is :)
*throws shoes at random to see what happens*
in best Tork voice I duck
PartyCannon: I WEAR a size 13 men's boot.
/me matrix dodges shoe and throws one and hits alex in the face
/me throws another shoe at rain
/me hides from shoe fight
Are we going to watch something later? can somepony of the Streamers tell me cause i wanna go and play some games :D

bad ofna01
* throws shoe at ofna01*
/me matrix dodges again
*runs away
Paradise92: it's random, just come back in an hour and check is all I can tell you
/me was confused because he wears size 41 boots, then he remembered size is different in other countries
/me walks up to ofna01 and shoots him in the head,"dodge that"
to many shoes to duckl
the eyelashes look a bit thick. maybe you wanna put some air into them?
lol size 41
Jim's boots are OP

05>idunbeliefu
:p
I have "Flintstone" feet
05we found bigfoot :|
I wear a 13 US
Hold, on, I feel I require to be informed
11 US
of WTF is going on right now?
shoe sizes across the world
Fazana: Shoes!
Shoe sizes
you know what they say about guys with big feet right Wrek? ;)
show sizes
Fazana: what did you think?
*show
**shoe
Um....
DAMMIT
ohai guise :)
We're getting in touch with our more feminine side
XD
Shoes and feet are different things
Rain: Big socks?
:D
I am not bigfoot
hey Tarku
hiya Tarku
ohai Tarku
why does my video keep auto pausing...?
/me throws everyone a MLP shirt
Wrek has been drawing for almost 3 hours
yay
just because I need size 14 wide
your all welcome
YAY
/me wears tshirt
is this a live drawing as in being drawn RIGHT now
Size 14?
sweet mlp shirt
Are you a PENCIL?
thanks ofna01
08,01do any of you wear contact lenses?
/me laughs at jim since he doesnt know its a bomb
nope
yes size 14 US mens
/me blows up the shirts
no
teehee
Nope, 21-21 (yes, my eyesight is THAT good)
why does the video keep pausing -_
/me explodes twice
-_-
JIM
oh US, y u so weird measurements
I do sometimes Sabatoged
you took 2?
contact lenses are awkward, in my opinion
My friend had some catseye ones
RainbowDashIsBest: bad connection I suppose
They were creepy D:
No, I exploded once from happiness, the once from the bomb
08,01KwakLad: what kind?
lol
/me thinks US should start using metric system
08,01have you ever had continuous/extended wear ones?
I'm 20-200 left eye, 20-400 right eye as of 2 years ago
my vision SUCKS
20-200?
Doesn't understand
yh
oh hey, shinedown
i love this song!
I forgot to remove my daily lenses when I went to bed a few times
Usually, good eyesight is known as 20-20
it means what over people can discern at 200 feet
unless im misunderstanding
I have to be about 20 feet away to make out
08,01KwakLad: gas permeable ones?
So, basically, you're long sighted?
let me put it this way
so, who wears glasses?
/me is lost in thought*
I can't even see the text on my screen at the distance of 3 feet without my glasses
me
I wear glasses and sometimes lenses
If you counted the time I had to wear 3d glasses in the cinema, yes
i don't
/me raises her hoof
08,01ah, okay
but yh, my eyesight SUCKS
06only for road driving. . .
/me hugs VioletVanilla
Mine's really good
have you met these people that ask to wear your glasses and then say things like "holy shit, you really can't see"?
06Anything else mein eyesight works well
*Trollface*
VioletVanilla: your lucky dear, I have to wear them for everything
hey cool how do you have colord text?
13glasses?
08,01it's just that i have this rash on my nose that is being caused by my glasses
Shizuka: yes, glasses
08,01so i want to wear contacts for a month
Only -1 in strength
/me 13can nicht see two feet in front of her face without them .-.
08,01but there are so many different kinds...
Shizuka: you too?
08,01does anyone know if it's advisable to have continuous wear ones?
Btw, is it normal that I could see in some 13-12 glasses? Even though I'm 20-20?
08,01the ones you leave in for 30 days
um I don't know Fazana
O)
08,01and never have to take out until you change them
These hiccups are annoying
Fazana: drink some water and hold your breath
mr. timn
08,01otakon: i know; i'm wondering if they're a good idea or not
Already tried it, all other 6 times
I'm effectively blind at 2 feet without my glasses.
i know this guy who had an eye operation and is now more light sensitive than others. he wars quite strong glasses, but boy, he has NIGHT VISION
It didn't work
08,01KwakLad: i've had the ones you take out after 12 hours and dispose monthly before
anyone here think we should worshipQ
um no
I had to wait for it to go, before hand, I was literrally ready to yell
08,01otakon: never had problesm with them
we are trying NOT to be seen as a "cult" alexxm
mr. timn needs icecream
that would NOT help
My night vision isn't all that good anymore
08,01otakon: speak for yourself; i'm a cult
Mainly because I stopped eating carrots
OMG YEEEAAAAH THIS SONG!!!!
mr. timn needs a pass to candy land XD
08,01otakon: thrue.
isn't that carrot thing a myth?
I want candyfloss
Hi everypony
I dunno, ask the mythbusters
ohai Scavender
08,01Fazana: actually, carrots don't help you see in the dark at al
does any one have a pass to candyland for mr. timn
hello Scavender
Dark_Horst: no, it's not. Beta Carotene is proven to help improve eyesight but you have to eat a LOT of it to see the effect of it
hmm wrek that twilight is so sexy
08,01it was a myth perpetuated by the british government during WWII to get people to eat more vegetables
08,01
hiya Scavender brb guys need a drink
Faulty internet is faulty
Eating too many carrots would make your fat orange though
which means you'll be orange
hey Scavanfer
08,01but i don't know true
08,01bugger
Minor snowstorm and pow, no internet for a day
well, i'd think it would help for sharpness but nightvison? you'll ned surgical lasers for that
08,01Jim: this is actually true
Jim: Um, isn't that blueberry, AND from Willy Wonkas magic (no snorting) factory?
mr. timn will kill you with kill you XD
08,01and beetroot makes your pee purple
yup
Getting stabbed makes knives red :3
carrots have natural red pigments. same reason why flamengos are red. they eat shrimp
08,01i actually have a rather funny anecdote about beetroot, but it's a bit too dirty for here
mr. timn always loves words with lots of sss's
...i gotta eat some beetroot sometime
What dirty do you mean, reproductionally dirty or sickly dirty?
mr. timn lives in your garden
and spinache and rhubarb when eaten in a small time frame can kill you
if you eat anything too quickly it would kill you
if i saw mr. timn on this stream tht would be so freaking funny XD
/me is scareed
o.o
I ate a treacle pudding in 10 seconds yesterday
Come Hither Eyes, Twilight.
My body is ready Twilight
08,01Fazana: a bit of both, actually
No more in the sense of spinach and rhubarb when combined in a dish or in your stomach form a toxin that is potentially fatal Jim
mr. timn wants to fight you thru a window
and then there'ws that spinache iron bullshit. spinache actually contains barely any iron. the reason we think it's so high is that someone once made a^decimal point mistake while calculating it
08,01i may be persuaded to tell it in the *other* channel
I know DEFFO kills you
Glad I don't eat spinach then
Mentos and Coca cola
Popeye learnt me nothing
Dark_Horst: but it does have a lot of vitamin !
A
Spinach is good
oh hit's a healty vegetable nontheless
06Spoiler Alert: poison does kill, do not drink if you wish to live!
I meant to say
Poison doesn't kill
R.I.P mr. timn ????-2012
/me hugs VioletVanilla "You are SUCH a silly filly!"
/me takes a HUUUUGE swag from cyanide
06D:
still the only spinache i eat is on my pizza
08,01KwakLad: *cough*#stupidsexytwilight*cough*
See, I'm al*drops dead*
06Fazana neeeeiiiiinnnn!
Hehehe, I'm not really dead
puts poisin in town water supplies
he's fine
I just got KOed
Somebody poisoned the water hole!
Good thing I'm immune to plain cynaide eh?
hawt dang, Twilight's looking goooooooood
yo
08,01Dark_Horst: i'm about to tell the story if you want to come back
agreed this looks REALLY good
nice song :D
mr. timn wants to know how he knows your a man when you wash the dishes like a lady think about it makes sense heh"
Wait...

I sound dumb, but what is inb4

inb4 that's a retarded statement to be blunt
yeah I know In Before, but not the context in when to use it
You inb4 to stop people achieving the obvious and inevitable.
/me is bored
Right
It means that you are "in" before X happened. X is usually something that'd obviously happen.
brb everypony bout 20 mins

When something is gonna happen, and someone can predict it, you would be like inb4 blah
UT?!?!?!?
Unreal Tournament for those who don't know.

Untz Untz

Good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
That was 7 seconds.

if you can hear closely it is the sound of molestia clopping
um
Jokes om you dr-whooves I like that song
Rickroll! AARG
i fell for that dr-whooves -_-
Ooh, Rick astley
Jokes on you, I like that song.

Neva gonna give you up!
Anypony got drawing idieas?

we're not furries
Not furry

Furries are different :P
Ooh, Rick astley
I'd like to be a furry
Serves me right, i rickrolled someone.

Never gonna give you up!
some bronies are furries though
furries are too obessed with yiff and all of dat shit
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBzfJF3C0CI

this^
dude
dont be a ahta
i dont have a problem with that
Sethisto is both, isn't he?
hata*
where is this song from? is that some sonic?
THE GAME
I don't mind furries, it's just when it gets all dirty.
anyone play starcraft 2?
yeah.....
I need to invite more furries here.
THE GAME
Lol
You lost it.
Yeah, furries are fine in my book...but its just the ones that Actually Have the fetish is when i draw thwe line :\
But....sometimes.....furries...send me...pics
lol furries
I'm a closet brony.
but furries are bad
its either bronys or furries..
when they send me those pics
I generally like the artstyle I see furries use. It has a certain je ne said quoi to it.
brony>furry
i..am disturbed..
^
I have to call spike to use fire
KetaminaDianePie - by all technicality, *we* are furries as well
It's me ThatsAShinySky.
Srsly.
not really
Its disturbing imagery
furries arent bad
je ne sais quoi*
Ponies- hairy creatures
Meh, idk
furry=anthro
though i guess it really comes down to how you define "furry"
^
similarly, how would you define "brony" when defending it
I don't even know what qualifies as a furry.
some people think "brony" refers to R34 and the like
What do you care about people's sexual interests as long as they don't harm others? :u
This looks so good
Someone not in the correct target audience for a show.
ya
Eye, sometimes it takes over and they never shut up about it
MirrorImage: Quite. Myself, I like the furry artstyle I see used a lot, but not the porn.
furry artists draw anthro
and are sex obedient..
Yes the book
All my friends like CoD, and sometimes, I just want to spear them all
wait, no. that's zoophilia. not furry
^
That's personification? no?
anypony watch SHed.mov?
i was being sarcastic MirrorImage
TF2>COD
^
Tovler|LENT: what are you giving up?
DR-WHOOVES
^
We dont talk about shed.mov in here
/me goes into THE SHED
dr-whooves: We are not supposed to talk about that here
I gotta be honest
YOU will NOT mention that here.
Kammerjunk - so no J Naylor?
OHH ya Fluttershy stare against princess molestia go fluttershy go
It's a shame I can't find much furry art without nudity.
we aren't?
What is so bad about shed?
yeah..
how abotu apple.mov?
Whos gonna wind
MirrorImage: Who's J Naylor?
LOL^
Well...Fluttershy just told us not too go in there ._.
I actually appreciate furry art (the clean stuff) most of it is really cool O.o
Shed was hilarious
We don't talk about the .movs here, not leave it.
RaveBrony: Exactly.
Unreal Tournament: I'd say it's better than TF2
But the non-cleaners..........
1,3Please don't discuss shed.mov here
ok i wont but why?
But quake 3 is better than TF2
-shivers-
dr-whooves: no we dont talk about it
why?
Because we try to keep 13+
ITS JUST HOW IT IS!
Becuz its disturbing to some viewers
PG13, yes.
The .mov's are explicibally 18+
okey dokey lokey
^
lol Shed.mov
sounds fun
cHANGE TOPIC
so odd
Cupcakes!
Hi otakon
i love those
But a good friend of mine was a furry, and the art he showed me was Outstanding!
1,3www.bronystate.net/rules
CAKE
dr-whooves: also a no-no when refering to the fic
KwakLad: I'll be on a diet of oatmeal, broccoli, soymilk, with some vitamin suppliment. I'm giving up pizza, sodas, etc
is talking about the Friendship is Magic Bitch video okay?
I LOVE CAKE! *Drooling*

But I ate the whole bloody cake.
oatmeal? are you CRAZY?
The cake is right here. Goddamn. Are you faucking blind?
Hell ya Fluttershy stare OP
:o
Dark_Horst: it reminded me of the Skrillex logo, to be honest
ekips: Yes, but that's irrelevant.
Sorry for breaking so many rules guys :'(

Pootsets pootsets
Wrek: what is that mysterious symbol on the book cover?
I was thinking that too Fazana ^^
Hehe
its a dragon rune
Dark_Horst: The same on the other 'Twi picture he drew.
It's unrelenting force, no?
Dah de daaa.
Maybe the book is Pony Sutra
It's obviously an adult book.
(although giving up the fandom for Lent would be interesting)
FUS RO DAH
Actually
It's FUS RO
:l
So Twilight what are we going to read today.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32c4H60CZQI&feature=g-all-lik&context=G2188b46FAAAAAAAAAAA
So the tongue of Dragons = Equestrian?
That book looks really sweet
Unrelenting force shout would be FUS RO DAH
I want to read that book ~.~
Ooo, now the magic!
Or maybe Twilight is just reading lore about the ancient Dragons.
but........
She's reading the diary of someone who played Skyrim

I like everything but the eyelashes. I think they are too long
They were working on it after RAGE
a new doom will be released at the end of 2012

-yawns-
flutter_spin: Twilight fixed herself up just for you.
Or the book.
Doom 4 should come out December 20
Probably for the book.
on 21th of december
AND THE HOBBIT MOVIE
As shucks. Don't have flash player on my phone.
Who knew
Yep, the eyelashes kill it for me.
Think they look good
The eyelashes are sexy
have you guys heard thorins song yet?
they look a bit too dense actually
i like them
I guess I never liked long eyelashes on ... anyone
I never cared about that sort of thing, being a guy.
they work on twilight
That. Looks. EPIC.
different tastes I suppose
Who wants to play pokemon?

Go VENASAUR
Anyone seen f1uttershy?
Let me rephrase, being concerns for looks.
/me imagines Twilight dressed up as Bayonetta
being without*
CupcakeWarrior: Gee, thanks for putting that picture in my head.
USE WRAP
I did not need that.
cupcake, let's not go there
Bayonetta isn't known to dress up...well...classy.
I definitely admire the glasses. Nice work on them
Jim i think thats why he suggested it :p

It's a bit of a new style, innit?
I like it.

Kammerjunk what you meen?
F'ing A Wrek. That is good <3
wrek her head is just awesome, but the rest of her body seems, awkward to me
RainbowJack: It's an Undead joke from WoW.
I'm tempted to make this my new background
Is anypony listening to me?
Is that wierd that this picture is hotter than most human women?
Kammerjunk : eeyup
ekips sush you
Granted, my background is 1920x1600, but I can work with this.
I guess the eyelashes are fine. The rest is cool
my monitors are*
"The Artist has requested Critique on this Artwork" to Rain
kidzrul434: yes. what'd you do that brought you down so much?
that twilight sparkle
I know ekips :p
/me curls up on the couch, under a blanket

nevertheless, I am considering this to have a place in my wallpaper folder
INB4 rule 34 on this pic

kidzrul434: Sorry to say so, but what's done is done. Beating yourself up won't change it.

SonicRainBoomScout: Oh gee golly whiz, that's a hard question. Let me just dig my backlog up.
Mine is either cupcakes or priness molestia..
Can't remember JKs, but deaf stallion makes out with vinyl scratch.
Magic around the base needs work
what on earth is wrong with that hair??
Wrek this looks awesome, just letting you know
/me is back
Probably "Imposition" or "Calling the Shots".
SonicRainBoomScout: is that question limited to MLP only?
Somone shipped Applejack_Cherille
Just watched the Borderlands 2 trailer
Wb
yeah..
quiet! Nothing wrong with her.. I mean her eyes.. I mean... ugh
Fazana: There is a trailer now? :o
strangest ship imo is TwiDash
those eyes are hypnotic
Alright, so it looks slightly suggestive. It's still really good art
#3
YTeah, there's a trailer
Look into Twilight's eyes. Lose yourself in their depth.
gorillaz YAY!
Gorillaz!
Gorillaz
Wrek, it's GORGEOUS. I want one in my room
OWWW YEAH I LOVE GORILLAZ!
Brace yourself, clopfics are coming from this pic
i'm still thinking a bit more air iin those eyelashes would be an upgrade. but that's just, like, my opinion man
I can't see or listen to it :(
^^ Gorillaz
19-2000 <3 this song
Fazana: Try going to Wrek's dA page, then tell me this is suggestive.
The_4th_Wall: ikr? if this was for sale, I'd buy it in a heartbeat
To think, when I first came on the chat, the drawing was just a creepy eye
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWJUSulnro&feature=youtu.be
BL@
BL2
Dee doo da bop
hang on, omg he customised the signature!
Which is why I put "slightly"
Fair enough.
I've also realised he has "That" soldier
1,3hehe, this isn't anywhere near suggestive :)
for his avatar
Wrek still drawing or just letting us see the pic now?
pootsets
Im gonna try a horrible attempt at tablet drawing after school tomorrow.
05goan take a break than draw anotehr image. the twi one is up on my DA
I tried to draw with the Wacom Bamboo tablet I have.
Then I gave up.
Okay :D
One of 'those' as in Twi looking like that
Want a bamboo but im poor
her look might be a tad seductive, but I'm okay with that
interesting... gema locked the borderlands 2 launchdate trailer. becasue of musik. so now i can't watch an advertising becasue the music in it is copyrighted
dr-whooves: Get one with a screen. I have one without, it's shite.
IM POOR
When you can get one, do so.
corporatetube, are you fucking kidding me?
What've they done now?
I get
/me saves as desktop background
£5 a week, how much is a bamboo?
interesting... gema locked the borderlands 2 launchdate trailer. becasue of musik. so now i can't watch an advertising becasue the music in it is copyrighted
that
they did THAT
Why does the pic remind me of skyrim sparkle? By Veggie55 I think
o.o
feel good..........
To eBay! What's the bamboo full name?
This song sounds familiar
MOAR Gorillaz :P
I've just realised my stream stops
well... that Borderlands 2 trailer made me soil myself in joy... that shouldn't happen .__.
Thought it was Gorillaz
feel good inc by gorillaz. mtv spammed that one up and down to no end
I would use so much pony for my desktops, but both my monitors are 1920x1200, and most wallpapers are made in 1920x1280.
Same :D
just out of curiosity Wrek (and sorry if I'm annoying you), but howlong have you been drawing in order to get this good?
feelsbadman.jpg
that's why you remember it
/me hugs Kammerjunk to make him/her (sorry :P) feel better
he's been drawing about 4 hours
8 min, 7 faves. nice
The music video was aired during the Toonami Midnight Run
maybe more
Ok, I am so excited for so man "2's" Borderland 2, Guildwars 2, Torchlight 2~
1,3lol
Dark_Horst: I mean lifetime
'S 'kay.
oh that
It is how I got in touch with Gorillaz
Guildwars 2 *_*
good question, that one
Guild Wars 2 beta signup is going on right now
Torchlight 2 is gonna be absolutely awesome
I want to buy Diablo III and that's basically it.
GW2 engi looks pretty cool
I don't buy a lot of games.
flutterspin, link?
eh. I played Diablo 3 beta, but I didn't care for it
I'm not gonna get DIII, I'll just stick to DII
OH MY GOSH. I CAN AFFORD A WAGON BAMBOO.£20! WOOP I HAVE £30
Diablo 3 isnt out yet?
https://beta.guildwars2.com/
I've been playing that game all my life
I'd love to be this good at drawing, but my patience usually runs out before I can get a decent stroke down
thanks
No. Diablo 3 is still tweaking... for the worse
www.ponyspin.com
LOOKS LIKE IT. caps odd
I'd recommend getting one with a screen instead of just a pad.
back with a bandage
I honestly played the beta and thought Torchlight felt better.

Anyway
or did i imagine that
It is why I haven't really played Bioshock. I'm alone. It isn't fun unless there are people around to laugh as I freak out.

There is a Hell in US somewhere
Rain: what?
So yeah, mario_pony. Deoxyribonucleic acid.
There is also a town in Norway called Hell
that comic made me DAWWW so hard
and in poland called Hel
Hell is basicly everywhere
ugh. I exceeded my math skills, slept through class, and still got a C because all grades were take from 4 quarter summary tests with no references

But Poland's got a city named Brony, so they're cool.
Poland cannot into space.
mario_pony DNA deoxyribonucleic acid

But it wouldn't have her personality...
Twilight is my favourite pokemon
Twilight is best pokemon <3

VINYL

hello Phase4 ^_^
there was a time I could name the first 150 pokémon by name and number
i think there should be a Pony/NeverwinterNights crossover :D
I'll be damned if abra wasn't rage inducing as cuss
make a landscape space drawing:)
ohai LordCelestia
I think there should be more MLP/Portal crossovers.
Hi~ how is everyone today?
I think my issue isn't being able to be good at something. I think it is the motivation in doing it. If no one wants me to do it, then why should I bother pouring my sweat and tears into it?
I'd like to Aribeth as a pony
i think there should be a super mario/pony crossover game
There should be a pony/earth crossover
hello there TheGreatAndPowerfulT
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Heus. Tired, but happy.
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
CupcakeWarrior, you used the wrong word, replacement, not crossover
ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
My bad
flutter_spin: do you want to do it?
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
I have no "want".
/me hugs everyone
flutter_spin: I know what you mean. in my case, if I don't get recognition, why bother in the first place
CupcakeWarrior: You mean like the million Human in Equestria fics?
I meant irl
Ponies invading us
flutter_spin: not sure what you meen
And that's why I keep telling you ponies to become quantum scientists.
brb. bro calling
We need that portal to Equestria
!*
CupcakeWarrior - so you mean like the MAD TV thing?
just came back from wal-mart, there was a pinklestia right there but i was short on money D:
no credit card?
bumer
nope
Pinklestia is so last month.
sucks
You should have started barganing for it
"I'll give you all my money and a shoe lace"
hahaha
What kind of unholy being buy Pinklestia?
"How much money are we talking here, Jim?"
RAWR
i was kinda hard to decide between food or pinklestia
about three fiddy
it*
SOLD
Hey Walmart guy , look at my shirt , now look at this , clearly offcolor , defective , give me half off!
I guess you could always paint Pinklestia white
"Dear McGyver. Enclosed is a paper clip, a rubber band and a drinking straw. Please save our dog."
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you should of chosen pinklestia
Hey guys. Try taking a CLOSE look at Celestia in FiM.
YFW you notice that Celestia has a pink hue.
FUCK THAT PINK HUE
He would only need the paperclip
Not entirely pink
05calm yourself
Hello Fillies and Gentlecolts
it's as good as nonexistant, whitelestia is canon, drop it
ohai CCCP
i was going too but that was not my money, i was shooping for my mom and i didn't bring my money with me so..
hi Jim
brb guys
heya cccp
hi ekips
Dark_Horst: But you cannot unsee it.
Well, look who's being judgemental of colours
hi CCCP
1,3Pink Celestia's going to be a collectible
yes she is a very light pink, and rarity is a very light grey
hi mario_pony
or you could wait until these hit the shelves. http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/celestia-is-finally-white.html
i never noticed in the first place, i'm confident i can
i know kirz
Neither did I until I was told.
pink celestia is in fact a shiny pokepony
i don't count outlines as actual color scheme
Dat facebook message
i'm going tomorrow and hope that pinklestia stays there
Oh no, her actual coat.
lol
Wait Wrek this is Ratatat right?
1,3the outlines are a direct component of their color scheme
hi kirz
i thought it was
my fb message
05yeah
one of the 9 beats?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You should have hidden it behind something else.
/me glomps Phase4
Cool
kammerjunk, one day i'll have to eat your soul
with a spoon
05wildcat
/me is glomped
That sounds like fun.
Kammerjunk: nope is bad to steal even for ponies
ahh
okay
/me should grow the balls neccesary to buy first pony toy
Good night everypony, I'm asleep
Wrek what program are you using for drawing?
nn Jim
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I meant so no one would take it.
maybe i should listen to them a bit more again :p
night Jim
05SAI

1,3I need to clean a spot up to actually set out my pony merch >.<
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no he meant hide it somewhere till you have enoughmoney to buy it
Sweet dreams, Jim.
Kammerjunk: ahh i did that lol
mario_pony: Oh, you slowpoke.
night Jim
it's not a matter of balls for me, the problem is that hasbro just won't sell FIM stuff in germany
night Jim
hi alexxm
kirz I need pony merch before I need to clean out a space for it >.<
and the few FIM articles they DO is are the crap ones
My mom would kill me if she saw ponies in my room
I know that feel Dark_Horst
CupcakeWarrior do it!
Why does every one i know excpet like 2 friend of mine hate ponies?
not that I want you to get killed or anything but just to show her who is boss
CupcakeWarrior: you can always tell your mom that it was a gift from a friend :p
are you a boss CupcakeWarrior? ARE YOU?
CCCP: bc they are close minded fools
CCCP: Because they can't remove the idea of how the old shows are.
cccp i feel your pain
Also what otakon said.
wait, wrek is drawing another one?!
otakon: yes they are it is impossible to talkl to the m about it.
and the two i actually tried to assimilate never quite caught on
CCCP it's a shame
Yup ekips
I hope he doesnt give himself carpal tunnet
whats this song?
oh what, another one? oh hell no, getting late and my fanfic will never get done at this rate
My friends know, and they've accepted it by now. They still think I'm odd, though.
goodnight everypony
Then again, they thought so before, too.
/me hugs Dark_Horst
Sweet dreams, CountDoofus.
O_o
Night CountDoofus
night CountDoofus
/me has Aspergers so everyone thinks he is odd
night CountDoofus
/me hugs bag

bag?
Wrek should totally draw the oversized jars of jelly pony one day.
...lol, bag
lol
i'm tired
Does the jelly pony have a name yet?
gotta go for now bye
Not sure.
later Conyst
Have fun, Conyst.
bye Conyst
05gotta replace the tip of my pen
pen?
05thats the 6th tip this month
what pen?
I thought you drew with your mouse.
There needs to be a Piccard pony if there isnt one... or a picture of all the Startrek captains ponyfied
stylus
1,3impressive Wrek
05the pen i use for my drawpad
Wrek: is this pc or tablet?
1,3pixel art = drawpad, vectors = mouse
if what we call jam you call jelly, what do you call jelly?
Phase4: You when you see my Pinkie Pie shirt.
so, how do you draw exactly? mouse draw pad combo?
i want a trackball mouse, can be so much more precise with one
Kammerjunk: ?
or do your toools have certain jobs?
ok I'm back
You asked what I called jelly.
My bro was talking about Castle crashers and the development on Battleblock Theatre
Kammerjunk: xD
so why there is not a pony named pete, every pony seems to talk about him :p
well played
I swear, those shirts cost a fortune to ship to Denmark.
1,3depends on what he's going with for the picture, sketch/painting types are easier to do with a drawpad, vectors are easier with a mouse
Thank you, good sir.
HOLY SHIT, it's gregorian
I get the feeling this is a crossover pony.
And nothing else maters!
When I said I don't have any want, I mean that I'm like Pinkie Pie. I try to have fun with people. When I don't have any friends, which is the case right now, what do I do?
these guys are awesome
METALICAAAAA
Are there tutorials for making vectors?
flutter_spin: You pony.
the more you know
You pony the hay out.
mfw this is a Metallica cover
1,3there are a lot out there CupcakeWarrior, just have to look around
the more you think ignorance is bliss ?
Kammerjunk: ikr?
1,3some on DA I know
The more you know, the less you don't.
the band's gregorian, they do covers of popular songs with gregorian singing
I have music I have yet to listen to, I have games I haven't played, I have stuff around the house I could do...
^
^^
you should hear their hells bells cover
But my mom sort of suspends anything I do. She doesn't like me paying bills, getting the mail, or taking out the trash.
I have around 15 GB of music because I download everything an artist made when I want to listen to 5 songs.
Don't ask me why. I've tried to figure it out. She wants to be in control
All my music goes to my ps3
flutter_spin: Not even taking out the trash=
?*
No. She complains that the trash isn't full enough. So she does it herself.
._.
Is anyone even watching the drawing?
i will delet teh internets from teh worlds.
I am.
i am
She is a hoarder at heart. She will deny me the right to throw away my own trash unless she knows it isn't anything 'of value'
Wrek: do you have The Dark Side Of The Chant?
from time to time i am
^
05i got spotify
i'm watching CupcakeWarrior i'm always watching
05which mean i have all their albums
its cool it looks like over time the picture is coming to life.
1,3I'm always watching too ;)
I want to read fics and play games and watch the stream and read a book, BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALL.
i used to like spotify
then i took liscence issues to the music collection
yay~ lurking FTW!
:(
I never used Spotify.
a playlist of over 200 down to 15
I only use Pandora
Spotify is awesome~
Because I'd just end up downloading it to get it on my iPhone anyway.
Kammerjunk: if you put your mind to it you can do anything!
CCCP: But not at the same time!
05now this is BA music
I need 4 consciences!
fantastic music <3
Kammerjunk: i have 3 u can borrow 1 from me
Is this that Caravan Palace again?
Ooo~ What is this?~ Sounds like Caravan palace~
I still won't have 4 consiences! Well, unless you count the voices in my head, but I don't.
oh hey, wings
They sound like Fluttershy and Twilight.
And they make me not be lazy.
I have pinkie pie in my head i think
What? a smoking pony? or is it a pancil?
That how cancer is in Equestria!
YFW it's a sonic screwdriver.
where?
I don't think it is.
the stick in the pony's mouth?
Yup.
Pocky~
its a pen
Could be a cigarette.
What pony is this?
I'm thinking a crossover with something.
You know, like Wrek's Syndicate crossover picture.
Ponies should know smoking is bad
oh gun
i'll say more syndicate
ponies with guns :(
probabyl another dash picture
Havoc is that you ?
I currently see a shiny Fluttershy with FF Weapon
with wings of gold
Is wrek still drawing?
1,3Wrek is always drawing
true
wrek's dedication to his art is amazing, isn't it?
no he sleeps and plays TF2 :p
Dark_Horst: Obsession*
or that
he plays marathon a fair bit
and hes damn good at sniping in tf2
Is this a TF2 crossover?
I wouldn't think so.
it might be another syn based pony?
Dark_Horst said Syndicate before, could be.
hi everypony
gotta go
BYE

Avê, Kipkat07.
CAPSLOCKRAGE

Yes otakon its SAI

SAI? that the band?
I will definitely see if I can't make a pony banner.
SAI?
no as in the drawing program
i have an idea for a PMV parody of Not Afraid by Eminem called "Not Afraid to be a Brony". How does it sound?
mario_pony: a graphics programme i guess
Kipkat07: I say go for it.
considering we are watching it
Kipkat07: Hi and it sounds cool
Hey KwakLad
Kipkat07: do it filly!
Hey PinkiePieCopy how you doing?
is one trick pony made by a brony?
05and yes
i have a few lyrics but its still a work in progress
I thought Wrek usi
05this is performed live
05no playback
Do it!
Good.
Oh it is? That's awesome.
Where are the cheers
PinkiePieCopy: There.
THis reminds me of

CCCP how can you SAY such a thing?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1287/
CCCP: I consider everybody to be made equal, even Gilda.
RedSpy oi. . .
Gentlemen, she can be redeemed. We have the technology.

OKAY WHY THE HELL DID I GET A FLUTTERSHY RAPEFACE?
shut up wrek, you're awesome, period!
You serious Wrek? Your drawings are something of a different tier in my humble opinion.
Erm Wrek maybe only because you dont do backgrounds so much?
PinkiePieCopy: Thank you for the Fluttershy.
It is adorable.
otherwise your ponies are on par
08,01go to http://bronyuk.org and tell me if it looks the same in your browsers as this: http://i.imgur.com/X5yb5.png

fluttershy why are soo adorable!!!!?!?!??!?!
What is this place, filled with so many MFW?
I know, and I feel bad about it too
Sad Shy :'(
bye CupcakeWarrior
CountDoofus: why sad Fluttershy?
cya CupcakeWarrior
bad news bronies I have bronchitis
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2472/
Beg pardon, what's that?
Take care CupcakeWarrior.
no offense, but did you mean bronytis?
because the fic I have in mind is a sad one, and I want it accompanied by something I've drawn. Fluttershy probably won't be one crying, but she was the first one that came to mind
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2179/
I think I might be going to hell for this
CountDoofus: make it as sad as MLD
fucking hicups
/me points and laughs
worth it
that means I need an inhalers
MLD was boring.
i had that then i had pnumonia than i had mono
Meanwhile: no
Meanwhile: It was a bit boring I admit
CCCP: Eeyup.
no
Meanwhile :O
CCCP: It was
Eeyup.
no
Eeyup.
no
nope
CCCP: Eeyup.
no
Eeyup.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I cried on MLD, but I liked Allegrezza better
NO
no
NO
dat spam
YES! no all caps :|
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup.
VioletVanilla: C-C-C-C-COMBOBREAKER
MLD? Major League… Daseball?
eh... MLD did nothing for me. it felt like the author was trying too hard to make me cry
goddammittabkey
Dat daseball.
I meant Vinyl.
05hmm
Tovler|LENT: My Little Dashie, a sad fanfic
dat tab fail
I have yet to read MLD, tomorrow i shall :)
Sweet pegasis
Wait, I just broke that combo? I win!
You can listen to someone reading it if you get bored reading
RaveBrony: It's not as sad as everypony says it is
:o
/me 's head jammed
I found "Simply Rarity" a lot sadder
Whats wrong Wrek?
am I the only person in the whole world who has no intention of ever reading MLD?
...Wrek...you okay?
Okay I shed a tear or two to it but that's it. I wasn't bawling my eyes out
CountDoofus: Simple Rarity?
05im ok but
Theoboldi: ofc not, you're never the only one of anything. Ever.
o.o
Agreed, CountDoofus. Actually, I found a number of stories sadder
05dunno if i am to continue on this one
Hmm
Hmmm
oops
mhm
Wrek: You don't have to if you don't want to
^
So there is another me? 6_9
why did i get kicked?
And why is it that not a single day can pass by without a MLD discussion?
HEYO bronies :D
Wrek: it's cool. The pic is awesome the way it is now.
CCCP: spam
spam ?
CCCP: Daribot.
Wrek whatever the artistic mind says~~
^
:\
Ooo! 'The white box' 6-star story, I know what I'm reading tonight
hi~ [SWAG]thehated5689
and damn thats a good drawing
But MLD is not boring
imo
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1347/
It is.
CCCP: It is believe me
No, it at least keeps your interest
Your opinion is wrong!
It dragged on
/me hugs DaringDude
Im siding with CCCP
Pegasister16: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7099507/1/ Simply Rarity
:)
Meanwhile: What made it boring to you just asking
Thus, there is no definitive answer.
:) Vinyl
c:
I would agree Simply Rarity is superior to MLD
Kammerjunk thank you for stating what needed to be said.
TOY_PON3: Try it's...everything. I'm wholly unmoved by heartstring tuggers.
Kammerjunk: i agree
MLD is a Good Sad fic but it's far from beign something truly great
FRICK
chat crash
everypony died
Meanwhile: I see, I was bored because I never quite understood the whole Father to Daughter relationship
it was a disaster
I think its one of the best fan fics ive read mabey even the best
05how about some music and perhaps even some gaming for a while?
How is simply rarity?
MLD seems too contrived at times to me, which takes me out of the story. It's hard to elaborate on that though without spoilers
Ive read about 6 fan fics, 2 im not proud of -_-
Go for it Wrek
YA
Wrek: that sounds good.
Sure Wrek.
do eeeeeeet
Whatchya gonna play?
sounds good Wrek
Midnight_Fyre: I agree
Minecraft
http://macromeme.com/cat/challenge-accpeted-toilet-paper.jpg
YNAUT
Sure, Wrek, you shud try DS again ;)
RaveBrony: i know what one of thouse is
Do you? :D
i think i cant say its name here
05DAT BASS
Same, thats why i didnt name them O.o
And it also feels like it's just brony wish fulfillment as well
the fic I have in mind is based on "The Magic Never Fades Away" on fimfiction, so I need some sad looking art to go along with it
Oh! My food is burning be right back
so the crying Fluttershy looked good, drawn-wise?
CountDoofus: yeah, the pic looks good.
What pic??
its too small, zoom in
I could imagine rainbow dash looking like that walking away from a explosion...and she never looked back.
MLD makes me wish I had Twilight as a daughter (sorry Wrek I know she's your favorite) but I know it can't happen which makes me sad
DAT BASS
mfw r0m thinks Vinyl is still called Nyria
now I've downloaded this My Little Dashie
i wish i had fluttershy

i'm having a huge performance deficit when i can't play tf2 on low settings fluidly. so i need software that finds out what the problem is

Everypony ready?
i'm running that BF3 driver
you're pregnant?
Pegasister16: what is it?
oOo
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1032/

10,02Nothing tastes better than correctly cooked bacon. You know the kind, the one where bacon is freshly served, has a little give, isn't crunchy but not chewy. The one you can bit into and your teeth almost sink into it a bit with little force needed to bite the piece off. It also has just enough grease on it that it feels right yet doesn't dry out due to the lack of it.
and/or a strange degreaser
Pegasister16: they are good, but I like salted cashew more.
I'm connecting guise!
suddenly SB...

infinity!
/me is thinking about having some coffee for dessert
CCCP: it's ALL the weird side nowadays
%
10,02The first batch of bacon isn't the best, it's always the second batch when you've got enough grease to really let the bacon cook evenly without burnt parts of it. The kind of bacon where you can eat all of it without having to piece out bits of it like some kind of nut.

10,02You cook the two SEPARATE

Bye Aircrafter.
Bye Aircrafter!! Take care!
so...I just got some rather disturbing news.
how does he do that running super jump?
D:?
RAWRity: tell us
Bye AC
bye Aircraft
It seems that, since for he time being they can't spend tons of money to ruin Akira with a live-action movie. They're instead going to do it TO BLEACH.
RAWRity: i read your fic... finally
Phase4: Pretty sure it's his sword's ability thing. It's more of a super-dash, but he can make it launch him into the air if he ramps it right.
i liked it!
Warner Bros. is making a live-action Bleach movie. Why. What. What. Why.
so its ANOTHER superwepon bonus that i cant get until i've played about ~300 hours
thanks valve
KwakLad: glad you liked it!
Yup.
RAWRity: Curse you Hollywood!!
RAWRity: Ew.
Wtf, RAWRity, are you serious!? O_o
RaveBrony: eeyup.
wait RAWRity... really? Bleach the anime?
do. not. want.
No, the cleaner.
Lol
Well, you can't "ruin" Bleach.
rofl!
Ohai, RAWRity!
also, Warner's currently working on a Live Action Death Note movie as well.
A movie of what bleach has to go through to clean your clothes...great ovie :D
That should end well. /sarcasm
*movie
RaveBrony: IKR.
because you know, those 2 japanese death note movies worked so well.
05nn all!
:D
i'm guessing nn means night night?
^
Even if it doesn't..
:o
NN, Wrek
night ngith Wrek

Will anypony be playingTF2 later?? I need to learn how to play :P
(That new chapter was cool. I'n not even going to pretend I don't like Bleach)
<3
btw, KwakLad. Glad you liked my fic. Now to wait and hope the pre-readers liked it.
Tovler|LENT: I lost interest in it a Long time ago.
Tovler|LENT: I used to like bleach, but well...the last few years I've been reading it more out of obligation than interest.
emangamer: Hey, honey!
I liked bleach awhile ago....but then i missed like 3 episodes and became Totally lost :D
Then the final seaso of Inuyasha came out and i forgot All other animes :D
I wanna be in bed with rainbow dash
^^^
soooo true :D
"I'll leave the server up"
Server is shutting down
RAWRity: what are pre-readers?

Right at the climax to.
I wish on my birthday that all the ponies from the show threw me a birthday party
Wrek has been idle for too long
*chugs his aloe juice* indeed
KwakLad: they're the people who read and approve any fanfics that get sent to EQD. Sent my fic in thursday, and I'm still waiting to hear back.
Less than a minute on the clock, last point is up, all or nothing "Serve is shutting down"
BTW it is not my birthday
So disappointing.

Worst pony is proud pony.
Jaegerpony, you can be a bridleful pony.
mhm otakon
LOL
darn
hi
No new episode this week
T~T
wrong
I know
Why hasbro?! WHY
no stream
hiya fillyfillyy how are you today?
It's like a dark shadow over my weekend
fillyfillyy: no stream
:'(
There's always a new episode in our hearts.
otakon....copy much?
fillyfillyy How di do?
I;ll have to go out and stare at the horse and pretend
I think Hasbro should always air the episodes every other week.
umm what KwakLad
I think Hasbro should dig a moat.
Then we'd never have a break between seasons.
fillyfillyy: no, I was answering your question, at least I thought it was a question as in "no stream?"
lol, how are you? :p
Just constant ponies year round
ohh you meen how dee do ok i know what you meant bro
hello fillyfillyy
a moat? do the taxpayers pay to clean it? :P
/me hugz TopHat
hi
I'll clean it for...
Oh hey fillyfillyy
hey Vinyl
inb4 The Hub decides not to air new MLP episodes at all due to Lent.
If Hasbro payed me in ponies, I'd clean their moat.
has anypony besides me ever put hush now quiet now on loop and fell asleep listening to it?
hiya
:O
brb
the CMC version?
Me gusta
Just get a fleet of Scoobas and drop them in the moat.
fluttershy version
No, but I say Cider Cider over and over again until I sleep.
ok... im back from dinner
It's quite worrying actually, the last 2 or 3 nights I have woken up and remembered I was dreaming about ponies.. is there a cure?
The cure is more ponies.
MOAR PONIES
Yes, more ponies.
^
figures
There isn't a cure for something that isn't wrong.
:D
more like days
Jaegerpony: you say "cure" like it's an affliction and not a blessing.
^
^^
one of the ponies was mean to me
/me burst into flames, lazily. ~___~
I'm not saying who it was
Hey guys can I make something clear?
http://e.images.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/9847524.jpg
I never dream about ponies because I'm a hypocrite brony,
Jaegerpony: was it Diamond Tiara? Because it if was, you have my permission to kill her. I'll even help you.
DUDE!!!!

only frisket can growl a virus into slowing down
lol
I see that someone or Wrek himself posted his newest twilight on 4chan /mlp/
the cg fails at life
Unknown file type, we're boned.
Back in the day, this was SOTA-- big time.
the question is cant you float off the ground so you dont get touched by the virus?
Bob had a catchphrase?
Reboot?
car is broken
ya reboot
I assumed the catchphrase was Reboot.
Still better than most TF2 video animations
I mean isn't that his catchphrase?
bob's catchphrase is 'This is bad, very bad'
dog is screwed

Cheedar?

09,01the gender of a female character in one of the later seasons of Beast Wars was changed to male from female

Raw energon hurts transformers, refined is their fule
Still am lost

Shakespeare... is often about tradgedy. And lessons must be learned...
0,14awwwwwwwwww
Awww. Wishbone..... ;_;
ded
Everyone treats R&J like some great, deep romance. In truth it was two hormone-addled teens who thought they were so "in love" despite barely knowing each other, caused no end of trouble for their families, and overreacted to everything so badly that they wound up killing themselves.
ded
oh damn it
NOOOO rosieeee
my chat derped, hold on
just like twilight
Shouldnt Wishbone die too?
0,14she liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiives

0,14...
lol
The dog from The Artist was better

The families dont become friends
SaxyPretender I think the Hayfields and McCoys can attest to that.
*Hatfields.
But what about Benvolio?
09,01I would love to see a version of this play in which Romeo is actually a dog
09,01you know you want to
http://mlfw.info/f/1883/
Dammit, I actually had tears brimming just now.
that would be an awkward kissing scene
NewDCD Duh! I'd like to see one where the whole cast were dogs.
Bahdoose
Wishbone was such a good show for its time.
I liked "The Comedy of Errors" much better.
DAT PLASTIC SALMON

Gnomes!
0,14used to scare me a bit when i was younger
MIDGETS
0,14also, inb4 BronyState Romeo and Juliet XD
/me ships Wishbone with Martha Speaks
I'm still surprised that this show got away with depicting Goethe's "Faust".
13and that was wishbone!
And they explain things pretty well, too. This is a decent summary of how plays work, for young kids.
I remember the halloween episode rather well
0,14oh right, they DID do Faust!
Shoo Be Doo~! Shoo Shoo﻿ Be Doo!~
0,14that's how I knew about it
How many episodes did you get >
I miss this show. It was a good'un.
?
13dcd you want to take over? <3
okay whats next?
They did Dante on this show?
Faust as in The Doctor or Faust as in Lauren
how do you get permission to stream videos?
0,14thanks for streaming the best part of my childhood, Shizuka
So many good shows when I was younger....where'd they all go? ;_;

I was gonna make an arrow in the knee joke :(
But yes, many thanks Shizuka! Was nice to see someone else remembers this show. :D

My childhood was PPG and Dexter
we should watch the super mario super show
^
0,14Wishbone and Bill Nye were my childhood
mario!
Ken: Pity. Wishbone was a pretty good one for its time. It's what shows nowadays seem to lack: you can be entertaining and educational. Sort of like some other classic shows.
0,14I learned a lot from those shows
I used to envy adventures like you.... But then I started shooting them in the knees.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSKYxJIkMo8&feature=g-hist&context=G233341eAHT0W2EAACAA
Bill Nye, Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego, etc.

Little spinny thing. How much I've missed you-- well, not missed you, more.. Um....... resented tyhe fact that you even exist.

Where on Earth is the Fox Cartoon. Where in the World is the PBS show
It's on the Hub no
I loved it just for Rockapella's music
*now
0,14what, CriticKitten?
shizuka, how come you always randomly translate into german?
she is with waldo, they are having a date next to gondor~
The Hub picked up Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego.

Wait, Carmen Sandiego wasnt on CN.

Billy and Mandy

That Candle guy isn't THAT scary
Ohhhhhhhh

RoflBot: that would be Dexter's Lab I think
See? I don't even have to say Jack :P
No. the scariest thing in the world... would be if they gave Sinbad ANOTHER TV show...
DESTROY US ALL!!
/me tries to find the opera that Where's on Earth is Carmen Sandiego got its melody from

By far, Ed Edd n' Eddy was the longest running cartoon on CN

Nope

Ooh. this game has the same vibe of 9 Hours, 9 Person, 9 Doors.
09,01and I'm liking it so far
DA GAPHICS
wonder what's going on
See, maybe it's just me, but a game that feels the need to WARN ME to make multiple saves to keep from being screwed....some part of that rings as "poor design" to me
mario_pony: The voice acting was good, the animation style was creative, and it was quite funny.
"Hai. I'm stale man"
Does this have any gameplay in it?
It slightly reminds me of Persona...
0,14mfw someone referenced 999 in here
0,14I need to get that game
the titanic game?
Persona owns
CriticKitten: yh, I've also heard the dialogue is a little prentenious as well
the graphics do indeed remind e of Persona scenes as well.
especially Mara
it was awesome, some of the scenes were scary
09,01it's a LOT like Persona 3

Krakass: it IS a PSP game
o/ It's a beautiful day on the earth. Why are we mowing astro turff o/
I am happy that they re-released the first half of Persona 2 (innocent Sin) for PSP. But I hope that they someday follow up with the other half (Eternal Punishment) as well.
ofna01 I think my SNES would say otherwise, but to each his own :).
It stopped because they had to make room for new shows, mario_pony.
...Why does it look like the school from Persona 4 :P
Oh, didnt know that.
Pegasister16: do you like Powerpuff Girls?
ofna01: actually I think the best console era is the gcb era
i miss the old CN
ofna01: who doesnt?
"Hmmmm?"
that matou
mario_pony: me too man, me too
otakon: i loved PPG
...Why does he get a voice actor?!
ofna01: sorry I ment otakon
time to mute
otakon: who didnt?
I CANT UNDERSTAND ANYTHIGN THEY'RE SAYING
Chowder wasn't doing well, that's why it was canned
otakon: is that bad?
wtf is this?
RoflBot: READ YOU BUGGER
That doesn't mean it's BAD
Why the japanese voices?
otakon: I BURGER FLIPPIN' <3333333 THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!!!!!! =DDDDDDD
mario_pony: is what bad?
^
Well, at least we still have… The Amazing World of Gumball?
Only that it wasn't getting the ratings it needed.
Is there english voices in this game?
09,01because this game has Japanese voices and no English ones
otakon: that i liked the PPG
0,14...is that the guy who does Simon/Jin Kisaragi's voice?
Tovler|LENT: oh dear GOD don't mention that
09,01which could've been good since Aksys does God-Tier Dubs
Pegasister16 dat burger flip
A lot of stuff on CN that was good was canned due to bad ratings
NewDCD: Japanese voices suck though

But Gumball is… good?

boom chicka chicka,boom chicka chicka
It has it's funny moments.

Gumball is great
09,01like BlazBlue's
Quite frankly though, There's almost nothing that Atlas puts out that I don't like. They can almost do no wrong by me. i even liked Baroque... and that one is a hard sell.
man this chat is going 100mph
It's a lot better than...JOHNNY TEST

09,01it can't be helped

The game can call her whatever it likes, but the character model is IDENTICAL to Rin.

how about we take shinji,and PUUSH him somewhere else!
Will I be able to understand the plot of this game if i dont know anything about the other Fate games?
That would explain why Rin looked identical down to the clothing.
Speaking of guys named Shinji... the fanfic "Shinji and Warhammer 40K" is awesome...
>:3 oh Everlasting_Joy, so despicable~

otakon / Shizuka: IRC pastes your message BEFORE it pastes other people's. So your screens wouldn't accurately show the order of each other's comments.
0,14...I never agreed with you >.>
Can the protagionist stop sounding like a TOOL!?
Whoooa
13CriticKitten: STOP GIVING IT AWAY
11,01Shizuka is the best ninja.
WHOA
He's like Hideyoshi Kinoshita from "Baka and Test".
You'd need someone else to tell you the order.
SaxyPretender: but you said differently!
13because no duh client echo... would waste packets to sent your lines back to you
and summoning monsters
cupcake inator
And on my screen, Shizuka was first. :p

hey... is this one of the Persona games? or is it just another Atlus game?

It's a very slow plot...
6_9
.-.
this is a PSP game, yes?
Also, what plot? We've only seen lots of talking and.....oh....you mean the regular definition of plot.
0,14also, the job of a localization editor is not fun

0,14I know the guy who does the writing
CupcakeWarrior: there is a battle system
0,14he's a very clever fellow
hmm. that banana reference makes me think of how wierd this game would be if it had the same plot, but starred all the characters of Ouran High School Host Club.

Shinji your arrogance will be your downfall.
oh,japan`

That bit right there, with the "And then he went back to his seat"....why did they have to tell us that in text? Was animating his movement from one location to the other too much work? O.o

Why are they refusing to animate very simple things?
Like walking?
Or bowing?
"ZOMBIE!!!!" -Adam West
Leo is gentlemanly.
Cheapness
But they animated the teacher's fall.
/me is reminded of Hideyoshi for some reason
So clearly animation budget WAS there.
"Well, I'm leaving"
0,14Cause it's adorable
that was simple, lol
ALIENS
"Poochie Style leave"
falling teachers is almost always worth animating
wow
aww...where is RAWRity
MahBoi: So is a student walking out the door!
BTW. anyone here play Forbidden Siren?
Name: male student
this is a very long school day
Or bowing slightly!
