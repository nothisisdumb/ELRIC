Everyone doing good?
9sup Jon
Hello Jon.
Dash has too much emotion to play setsuna.
hoy hoy jon
9yeah, but only one pic that I can recall
9Just look at them.
I recall a dude on DA doing some..
the hair works
/me 7is still stumped as for a name for her image.
Give me a second.
9....this is glorious http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c570ed967488396d9801da2e10217ec/18453%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20comic%20mecha%20robot%20scootabeam%20scootaloo%20super_robot_wars.png

>mfw I have TWELVE tabs open.
9Noriko
that's the one
6I forgot the continues are different in SA
/me 7is thinking about just calling it 'Birds'. O_o
I have far more than that.
7o.o?
6fok = face on keyboard
I normally have 4-5 tabs open.
7Ah.
13LOL
7Interesting abbreviation.
7D:
9quite frankly
9if I were to put Dash in a mech
9it'd have to be something much faster than that
9probably Cybuster
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CW6zX7kzO0w/TkRqho2mDMI/AAAAAAAAKQg/awuWXvLZzSw/s1600/rainbow_dash_nanosuit_by_hereticofdune-d4650x9.jpg
7Weeeeeell, you disconnected.
>mfw I have no clue whats going on cause I don't watch anything mecha
9hence why I said Cybuster
7askjaertnadknopdfnjslembirtbsklfg;s;sejirneksldsgldjspaikflfjfdogja;dkghbvghrioperjkga;dkltmeejosghg
Jon, all you have to do is watch.
9is probably the fastest mech in fictional history
And enjoy the sight.
meejos
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiAfILPv8Bo&feature=feedu
9but other than that
9Dash'd be a good Valkyrie pilot
the one marked self destruct?
/me runs
Skip of 3 seconds long
skip of 7 seconds
skip of 1 seconds
9huh
9seems
he's saying the streem is lagging again
yeah it just began skipping like crazy
7Birds is still my best option. X.x
9downloading OOO's is taking a lot of my bandwidth
9give me a moment to cancel that download
9and get one via mediafire
you gonna try it too, angel?
9welp
er rate
9no OOO's tonight
"How does the yacht fit in?
OOO?
9give me a moment
what's OOO?
9gonna bump up the quality
"It was part of a yacht club."
9and start the LQ Stream as well
9Kamen Rider OOO
OH
9what we used to watch in Post-Show
suddenly geting a mental image from the sleep over ep.
Cause zoom makes the text tiny.
dont fullscreen the streem
is this really whats going on 3 hours before anything starts? >_>
yes, TTS
Isn't this DCD's last stream?
9LQ Broadcast is live!
9Thetrollside: till the preshow officially starts
9basically
9it's not even preshow time yet
if oyu dont remember
I'm okay with this.
9man I like FE a lot
9I WISH animations in FE were THIS crazy
sleep is for the weak
9suddenly Laguz doing crazy million-hit combos on enemies
But when I sleep, I dream of ponies...
*Squee*
Do Cyberponies dream of electronic sheeps?
Lyn I think her name was?
doesn't she just crit everything?
9I think it's today
Lottery is today
9SOKOOOOO
no kill like overkill
oh my bad japanese
Jon, there are things even more awesome than what's already on stream ATM.
Wait 'til you see Gurren Lagann or Dai-Guard in action.
9e'yup
soooo
Purple, that's the player character.
you dont know the story
just like the explosions
mecha man
9well there are translation guides for the story in development
9but yeah, I'm clueless
9but then again
Why not aim for the head? where the pilot is?
9Pinkie
9why do you settle for less?
...Not if you just blow off the head.
besides the pilots are always in the chest.
9why not
9PONIES IN DAI-GUARD?!
on the GROUND?!
Well, they already kinda did the magical girls thing in season 1
lets see them do Magic Knight Rayearth for season 2
9http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/18116?search=super_robot_wars
(Dai-Guard pilot is justice-like)
9PONIS IN DAI-GUARD
OH RIGHT
7Hrm...
wrong drill =p
/me 7decides to ninja-upload that drawing.
9yeah
...*shrug*You can always use a drill.
9Dai-Guard's is the Drill of Awesome Suckage
Awesome...suckage?
*blinkblink*
9if you watch the series
9SRWZ2
9they lost control of it at first
9due to FUCKING TORQUE
yeah
They took TORQUE in account
lol
9the whole series
yeah

Greetings, subjects.
Yes, that is me.

MOON-TOUCHING PUNCH!
I think its dead.*looks at moon*
9LUNA! EINA!
GRAVION!!!
viva la resistance?
If there is a 1° reason to play SRT it's the overly dramatic battles.
Except it's good and has 20% mreo explosions.
mech-ael baysplosions
9or
9you could play one of the English SRW first
9and get the hang of it
That helps too.
SRW-J is good to try to get the hang
wheres the fun in that? 8D
the more en it cost the more it hurts =p
hi mib
...Did the mech just go underwater?
*blink*
yes he did
from below
also online guides help with Japanese games
the japanses, how do you they work? Dx
ugh
japanese*
Wait, why don't Gndams have their obnoxius theme like in the rest of the SRT games? D:
9is anybody checking the LQ stream?
They work diligently and with lots of gusto
...L...Q?
*blink blink*

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
INTERESTING.
Definitely not Gundam Wing. Those mechas run on emo.
9I think I'll tweak the quaity an eenzy weenzy bit
4Yeah, and I was slightly freezing a couple times
(Which is why Heero's was always the most powerful)
4And now the stream is gone
lol freeze
9and it's back again
just reload
9lowered from 600 to 550
4I'm guessing my stream drops now
9quality difference should not be very noticeable
@pony Solarboy27's waifu

9how is it now?
It's fine here
5by5
I can let you know every time it freezes
9I want zero freezes
4I'm guessing it freezes for Val too?
11if you're referring to the HQ stream, mine is running smoothly
eh...not sure...last time I checked it was like...I don't even remember...19? 16? I dunno
been fine here from the point you stoped OOO

4As long as it allows for fluid streaming with no freezes or hiccups
OK
That's adorable
9how is it right now?
No freeze again thus far.
well it's fine now, but again it happens randomly, not consistently
4slight hiccup
the best I can do is let you know whenever it happens
http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b88/nick-metroid/trollfaces.jpg
4It appears to happen during battle sequences

06interactive movie of sorts
4And Battlefield Earth was a *bad* film
4Real bad
06that was re-released for the pstriple at one point? (like with many consoles before it)
Yes, it was, but it wasn't cheap
06If not, sorry
06xD
There is no way BE was an 'a' film for sure
4But it was bad
there's a reason Battlefield Earth is part of the bottom 250 movies on IMDb
