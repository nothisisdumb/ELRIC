He follows Sumica around, and his shift is almost over
pretty sure atleast
Barb stop stalking mods
hii
00,10normaly you would be right, but not this time, i left work early cause I have to be back in 6 hours
Wow that sucks Sumica :/
Sumica: awww =(
Wow...six hours.
Owch.
Shall we visit your boss?
oh god...
haha
/me get's a steel bat
That would be bad. "Um we need our Sumica back. You suck boss man. Yes we are from bronystate. What do you mean "fired" ?"
What do you mean your leg's wern't broke when we got here.
XD
<3 Dr. P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lF-nYZh_sM
Why did I stop listening to this stuff? Oh right. Ponies.
hey
/me does not care for it.
Its funny that I don't even care about Fenech Solar, but I love the remixes made.
Soler*
It gets better around 2:40 Crystaline_Shard ?
/me listens to owl city fireflies.
Oh. Blargh. I can see our taste are polar opposites XD
Barb if it sucks at the beginning why would I stick around ?
how goes?
/me sits on a cloud
Nah I don't have any taste I find i song I might like it not one particular artist or anything
just because i can
not one genre or anything.
/me slaps the chat around a bit with a large trout
/me noms trout
:P
/me listens to Skillet Hero AMV DogDays.,
I believe it was George Harrison who said "The words don't have to make sense. They just have to sound good together."
Tru.
Which explains a LOT of the songs he wrote. XD
haha
heres a really! goodo ne.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBzqOa9y02I&feature=BFa&list=PLF8D0137D95C6C611
Tribute to gamers.
That's really cool. =D
Gold_Demona: that's why F
Gold_Demona: *a lot of gibberish song sound good :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM4iQn2Si-U
Ever hear the Loco Roco theme song? The song is LITERALLY in gibberish.
No real words whatsoever
Crystaline_Shard: the anime? I just saw a couple guys riffing on it :D
Gold_Demona: just accents
But the song is catchy is all hell
I know the damn thing by heart. ._.
MadSurge: you mean DogDays? yeahg I enjoyed it if just for the animation.
I made my own lyrics to the Blue Locoroco's song :D
Crystaline_Shard: Magical Ninja Warriors with animal people :D
/me listens to the hoosiers Cops and Robbers.
Who cares it's fun to watch if nothing else.
:D
Crystaline_Shard: but why do they become cat balls
To incapacitate them without killing them?
They don't die on the battle feild their wars are actually large scale games. you pay some money to enter you do you country proud and if you do good you get more then you spent the rest of the money goes to projects like hospitals and such it's their way of taxing you.
The war areas are under magic protection
Though humans are excluded from this protection so they can bleed.
Because the magic wasin't designed to protect beings fro manother world
It's like tag turning into a puff ball means your out of the game till medics can heal you or something.
/me sways to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSXzPaTgqo&hd=1
C418 <3
I need to buy those albums
Crystaline_Shard: that's a convoluted way though to make war non-lethal :D
each "kill" net's that side a point or more they are totaled up the end and that's how the admisson money is split up.
MadSurge: but they arin't actually war it's a game to them.
The last few episodes get serious and show what happens off protected ground
and why the magic fox ninja's need a damn nerf :/
:D
I actually made a WH40K faction based on them.
It failed epicly of course but it was fun trying.
Crystaline_Shard: at least there's actual violence :D
Especially the last few wpisodes. the fucking anime takes a bloody right turn and has no regrets about it.
Crystaline_Shard: so I take you like anime :D
Also it's fun watching them wail on each other with out the useual omg war it's stupid but i need to fight . FUCK YOUR DOUBLE STANDARDS TO EMO GIT GTFO!
you*
Yes I do.
I enjoy it too occasionally
You should hear me qoute Gundam in my ultraboy prime voice. :D
Got some good suggestions?
/me hugs mica
Crystaline_Shard: I'LL KEEL YOU TO DEATH
good, you?
Guilty Crown. Sword Art Online. uhhh I don't watch too much that'
;s not popular so much.
so if i recommend it you prolly seen it.

well ya still have a chance ;)
so... how's everyone?
good evening gents
Sick.
and ladies (?)
Hello.
evening Alchemie
wow, it really shows that its not summer anymore
lowest number of people here IVe ever seen around this time of the day
This is the deadest I've seen this place. Also hi
Baaaaack
school, work, it's september, bounds of people doing other things
well, people have sh*t to do. I dont blame anyone. Im not here either for many many hours anymore.
It will get better once S3 starts
Also no stream makes people wander off
I would be working today, but my boss doesn't know when the truck comes, and he still hasn't called me yet
movie nights are still busy I presume?
Alchemist: Yep
yea somewhat
im gonna make a hotdog
brb
:) When is S3 out :s
MaxTheBrony: I guess sometime november?
it's alsmost 11:30 where I am
MaxTheBrony: we'll know for sure in these 4 weeks :D
In Pacific time it is. Here in Eastern time, it's 12:30
:) yey
we still have like 23(?) days left for that announcement
^
Breaking announcement: Season 3 will feature PONIES
did anyone see the efr interview with the VA of Zecora?
no, kinda forgot
Alchemist: what about it? (I didn't)
It's 9:29 in PDT
That's the time zone where California is in
I havent seen it either, was just wondering how is it. I'm not especially fond of efr interviews.
I've only seen the ones with Tabitha and Ashley Ball and they seemed a bit...forced. Especially the one with Ashley Ball.
any Mother 3 Fans in here?
I saw the interview with Tara Strong on Fat Man on Batman and it was not
you're talkin to one <3
even in the same ballpark
Dken2021 Do you like the Mother 3 Soundtrack?
Alchemist: Tara is very open with everyone it seems :D
I loved Mother 3
yea, I did like the music in that game
I didn't like it :|
did like the green and red train music
they made a very special kind of Music Rip for that game, to get the highest possible music quality XD
where at?
I'll give you the Link in a min
Any swedish people here besides Wrek?
So i thought my throat might be hurting because of my tonsils, but its not near that area...
they ripped the MIDI files and made a Soudnfont with all the music, and reapplied the sounds to the MIDI again afterwards, now they music has even better quality than the GBA Itself had and it's still all 100% tur to the source, (exept for the panning in some songs
MadSurge: http://derpy.me/qSYP0
Lil_B oh man, sounds excellent
Alchemist: well, I guess not about EVERYTHING :D
MadSurge: maybe she was just tired :D
Dken2021 it is, I used the FLAC Torrent ... 2.3 GB of Music XD
well there are like 250 tracks
Alchemist: even like that, she's still good looking :3
Dken2021 here is the link http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother3/MOTHER-3-Ultimate-Music-Rip/
Dken2021 250+ some unlisted
MadSurge: oh yes :) and she KNOWS it :D http://derpy.me/Wg4GY
ah thanks you Lil_B
Alchemist: *pomf* O__O
In public too. The SHAME!! Oh the humility of being a pegasi. Or would it ponility?
Ponility sounds sillyu
Annnddd I should really eat something. Even I think I am being weird, never a good sign.
Barbetos|AtWork: you are not weird...yet

/me gets derpy to deliver sword to ofna01
Now we just wait... muhahahahahaha!!
/me throws sword at Barbetos|AtWork
/me XP
Usually in videos like this, it's the lyrics. Or in this case, funny interpretations of the lyrics. :P
comments on youtube are quite predictable now
So?
They have always been predictable
Gold_Demona: nothing to it, just saying.
:P

Sssh, Heavy is asleep.
Is it possible to sue a morgage company for taking money before you allowed it or before when you said for them to take it out?
Spongebob music...
05SpadeMagnes[School]: probably
05ask a lawyer
SpadeMagnes[School]: ask phoenix wright
Phoenix Wright is a defense atourney, not a prosecutor
They just went up and took 35,000 dollars from my parent's retierment fund before the date they said to do it and more than was specified
SpadeMagnes[School]: get miles edgeworth on the case
05SpadeMagnes[School]: definetly a scam
._.
SpadeMagnes[School], yeah, that's messed up.
God I hate my life....
05and even if it isnt a scam
GMod ?
05is not legal methods
05so you can get them on that aswell
This is messed up.
rofl Red Team :P
Yes. The stuff we're talking about on IRC is more messed up than the stuff on the stream right now
My mom said we probably cant get a lawyer on this..but if push comes to shove we'll find a way
What's going on in chat? Just got here
soulrider95, SpadeMagnes[School]'s family got scammed.

Is anyone else ever creeped out by 3d rendered ponies?
nope
love em
Hello everyone.
i am Unnr
Nope their even more cute
ohai Meanwhile
how are things Meanwhile
Unnr: only the ones with tiny eyes
ddamnit, the Source Pony Models are soo good >.<
Meanwhile: Hello
heya Meanwhile !
hello
Its something to do with how they are rendered... they really need a more cell shaded approach, to get that darker border you get with flat ponies
We can't call them GMod ponies anymore, since they work with SFM too
Hai Captain McAwesomeFace
Forever a scout.
Everyone is injured
Fastest cap ever
Lo T.
Unnr I actually like how they look in 3D like this, although having still a big boarder would be... interesting I think in SFM
Ded.
More TF2 Gameplay :(
He wasted like 40 bullets
Bonk.
Unnr, the Source Engine might need to be updated to support something like that. But since Gaben is a brony, he might be happy to oblige. But it would require that Valve make a game that features it.
did you see Schyther already ?
TROLOLOLOL
Wow... that spy is a troll
wtf xD
Is that Dickshep?
Shepard needs to chill out.
^
I did not.

ROFL
Hey whoever is streaming :D
Und dann chat was confused.
What does RAM stand for?
Really Angry Marsupials.
SpadeMagnes[School], Random Access Memory
the new champion in LoL is Schyther
Random Access Memory
what the others said
So what does RAM actually handel?
random attractive mom
I wonder what Wrek oh...
Sounds...uninspired.
oh right
Kandarihu: It could be faked decently enough with a well tweaked colour map
>_>
Video games more important :P
I mean Really attractive mom
:p
TF2! TF2! TF2!
:3
is like a mix of rengar and udyr with pokemon on top
It's Planet Side not TF2
I know.
SpadeMagnes[School]: It's essentially where program information is stored when you are actively using the program.
oh Wrek's playing PS2? I'll hop in in a sec
Then TF2... WITH PONIEZ :P
SpadeMagnes[School], it's where the computer temporarily stores data as it's using and processing it. The more RAM there is, the more it can handle before lagging up like crazy
WASABI!!!!
Is there a way for me to decrease lag in WoW besides decreasing the settings?
brb
if it's lag, you can't do much, if it's fps drop, buy a better pc
SpadeMagnes[School], close out of any big programs that you don't need.
Oh...this song...
the fps seems to drop when alot of shit is on screen
Russian Pony :P
Well, time to pop into PSO2 for a sec
Well I may get a new desktop soon...I hope
Well I'm gonna watch YouTube now...
No idea on the actual time when I will get it but I'm going to get one sometime
bye guys
bye Kakumy
FLY TO THE SUN
If I time out in 4 minutes, blame Game Guard
I'll be back I have to go attend a class
Goodbye SpadeMagnes[School]
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Captain PipSqueak / Painting Pegasi / Tavi and Scratch - The Encore
I'll be back in a half hour or an hour
maybe
Alright. I'm fine
gonna play some tf2
bye
btw Wrek, you should check you video stream options, we only see a part of the game window
what server and faction is Wrek playing on?
Herse, NC
05wait what ekips`
d
05ok let s see
05restartign the thing
much better now
and suddenly sexiness
Dat Spy Wallpaper
Wow. The month-long event PSO2 has going on now is WIERD
weird.
Right. Sorry. WEIRD
What is it?
What's going on?
Some sort of Moon Viewing festival or something. The central monument in the Shopping District has been replaced with a red-leafed tree.
And orbiting the top of the tree is a little moon with a rabbit on it holding a mochi-pounding hammer.
Well ok then.
And the music has been changed to something, well all I know for sure is that it sounds like traditional Japanese music.
And that traditional music plays in both maps of the Arks ship.
Holla everypony! :)
Frankly, it's got this traditional feel to it, but it's still as overly dissonant as any other song in the PSO2 OST
howdy GilDash :)
Dat shrug :D
Hello GilDash!!!
am I right to assume that we're taken with the gameplay, thus no chatter? :D
MadSurge: Holla! :)
Nah, it's just dead chat. XD
I don't even know what's on the stream. Not got it open. :S
I got games and Inception to look at!
Ohh, Inception! ^_^
indeed
good film
as for me, im nomming on lunch, so i thought to come on and have some company instead of sheer quiet
Yfw it's quiet in here.
...and apparently, the desire for company is a bad thing to want...:$
d
Meanwhile: Come on now, it's been quite on here often enough that my face is the same no matter what. XD
/me puts Meanwhile in a room with molestia and trixie
What's the song?
http://i.imgur.com/Nkkl4.png
It's classy!
CLASSY
I guess the trilogy events we had this summer were meant to prevent the IRC from dying out like this.
More like, to have something to do in summer.
Why do I feel like we're listening to Jazzified Banjo Kazooie songs. :D
And good afternoon everypony! :)
Lo Klumzeedragon.
Wrek is best Pilot!
Hello Klumzeedragon :)
sounds like the trials from final fantasy 10
He said, as he crashed upside down into a rock.
Meanwhile: Twas my point. ;)
Amusing, but I wouldn't want him flying my dropship >.>
And how is everyone so far today?
I hear awesome music
what is the name of that song??
okay
13http://i.imgur.com/GBGVA.jpg
hi Shizuka
trying to stay up as much as i can to have relatively normal sleeping time
Klumzeedragon: I am still using that teapot gun that pinkie gave me on borderlands! :D
No one knows, I suppose. xD Except for Wrek. And he's busy shooting things.
FOR the love of celestia1 whats the name of this song!
Random Shizu pic, check.
I WANT IT! NOWWWWWWWWW!
Shizuka, lol
13meanwhile complaining about pic, check
Lol
awesome shizu come back....
Check
I didn't complain, you've just gotten a bit predictable.
13so have you
and Meanwhile being snarky...check
:D
Point taken.
MLP_Brovakiin: Ha ha. :D I bet. It's a pretty awesome weapon.
It is Klumzeedragon, even at lever 30 :P
*level
;a;
the song is over and i never got the name
:'(
this one also nice
Yeah, when Meanwhile posts a link, it's usually that moth, spider, or squidipus.
This sounds like one of those "X happens while I play unfitting music"
Indeed
PinkieSpice: I'd tell you if I knew. :D It seems only Wrek knows. And he's busy killing things.
Klumzeedragon: http://i.imgur.com/2W9XC.gif
Shizuka sets shit on fire while Meanwhile plays unfitting music
oh wow
i just noticed the glasses
they are awesome
Wow. Turn stream on and actual Wrek. :S
such an interesting soundtrack
=_=
I wish aI hate a name
Have*
not hate
Meanwhile: Is that an eel? :D
Frilled shark actually.
MLP_Brovakiin: Damn. :P It was never that good for me. You should have gotten your own teapot by now.
i want some fried shark
Shark isn't particularly interesting as a food. It's very watery.
I really wishs I can be an LPer, sadly, I don't have the programs needed...
Meanwhile: The more I know! But it's not as weird as a blob fish.
True. http://i.imgur.com/IY5RO.png
I did, I gave it away as it wasn't as good, though I must say I now have a handgun that does 4199 damage :P
* Klumzeedragon
Meanwhile: Exactly. :D Weird look bastards.
lookin*
<.<
What game is this anyway? :S
Errr... Wrek doesn't know "People who wear glasses during night/inside house are douchebags" XD
wat if i ate super spicy food with extra spicy
Vordox: It's so you can't see his eyes. :P
lol
MLP_Brovakiin: That sounds like a damn fine hand gun. I got one that does like 700 something x2.
I guess knives in this game are made of rubber.
gah, my aim in this game is so bad...
No one going to tell me what game he's playing?
Klumzeedragon: Nice, we should play it again sometime :)
Planetside 2.
GilDash: Planetside. :P
GilDash: borderlands 2
Meanwhile: Thank you.
oh, wooops
You're welcome.
twilight_sprinkle: I'm not that thick. :p
Why Wrek is wearing glasses? Because he is The One.
GilDash: i wasnt joking, i dont really know what borderlands is so i forgot
Wrek always wears his glasses. :P
He was flying a ship earlier. and those look like aviators :D
none of these fancy modern technicolor games could run on my laptop anyway
MLP_Brovakiin: Of course man! Anytime you're on. :)
I've got a broken pair of aviators somewhere. All I really need is a new screw for them, but I keep forgetting to get them done.
Surely wearing those has got to be a detriment to aiming.
Klumzeedragon: I am on anytime after 4 pm gmt time as I have no scoial life :P
^
what
hi
Hey, what
Meanwhile: Compensate with a bright screen?
Heya what

Didn't see that coming... >_>
Does melee actually do anything in this game?
MLP_Brovakiin: 4pm being what time in the US? :P
123134
?
what is this game
Klumzeedragon: gmt, hence +at least 5
Planetside 2.
PLanetside 2
o
so erm
what what?
Cheerio pip pip.
whats your favirate (<---spelled wrong) pony
Lolwut
Klumzeedragon: I'll be if I know :P I will proabaly be on when you are on, put it that way :D
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
what: Rarity
well there all good
6_9
what: mine twiraightu sparkru
Meanwhile: Of all people, I didn't think You could spell 'Everypony' wrong ;)
Meanwhile: Fish and chips, wut wut?
RaveBrony: What do you mean? I spelled Pinkie Pie just fine.
also "x is bets pony" is up to par with black alicorns
*best
Meanwhile: Haha :D
trollolololol
MLP_Brovakiin: Alright man. :) I havent seen you on for a week. So I was curious.
have you seen saberspark
And then chat goes into best pony discussion.
what: Of course.
Oh fair enough Klumzeedragon :)
yeah
4 chan
3chan
2chan
There's never anything to discuss as far as best pony is concerned because inevitably someone says "Everypony is best pony :D" and then everyone else agrees with that.
1chan
inb4 kick
go
But I thought everyone knew that Pinkie is best pony
BS, Meanwhile. Everyone IGNORES that and goes on bitching about who is best pony.
13hai rei
I know this from personal experience.
Rei what fandom do you think this is.
Also hi Shizu. And everyone else.
mlp=asome
Because do to all the different opinion, there will Never be 1 pony that everyone finds to be the best :D
MLP_Brovakiin: So unless you play offline, we need to play again. :P
*due to
Mean, which chat do you think you're in?
Not the same one you're thinking of apparently.
Klumzeedragon: I only play ofline if I am off of school :P
13what: I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with our rules at http://www.bronystate.net/rules
uh oh, the rules link is coming out
oh, we had a rules page, whoda thunk it
o_o
The problem, Meanwhile, is that "everyone agreeing that everyone is best pony" implies either a) logic, or b) lack of butthurt.
Okay so. Does anyone happen to have a max-level character in WoW? I'm trying to get an idea what the approximate amount of experience is for a normal max-level quest.
Shizuka laying down the law up in here.
hi
13aren't you supposed to reach max level in wow on your second day?
Who's breaking rules?
and how
Shizuka: Yes. Yes you are. If not on your first.
13that's what i thought
do we have a new guy?
And Meanwhile, you forget that despite being ponies, we are still an Internet fandom with the appropriate amounts of butthurt and whining.
13it's a feat that can only be managed by the most dedicated of grinders
Some people like to take baby steps.
:D
Oh hey, alexxm.
sup RaveBrony
I have no idea, I'm just trying to match it up with GW2's quest XP curve.
MLP_Brovakiin: Makes sense!
this is the first time ive been on here :D
13played the ten day trial once, was bored to tears after three days of nothing but "go here kill ten x come back and talk to that guy"
We can tell ;)
yep
13if wow has a story, they have it well hidden
Quite true Reikim, but more often than not I find chat in here tends to agree with itself because of the way the shows morals are interpreted.
Shizuka: pvp is lotsa gun though, minus all the butthurt
*fun
13can't stand pvp
Klumzeedragon: It stops people accusing me of bunking class :D
Shizuka: Its in the quests
Shizuka: You forgot "go here kill y until x z's drop and then come back to this guy"
Allow me to sum up PvP in WoW
True enough, Meanwhile. I concede/
Crying, lots of it ^
bob>jeff
>Bubble Death and decay stun stun stun stun frost nova stun bubble lay on hands buble stun death grip totems stun stun stun frost shock stun
ello everypony
Did I mention stun?
13MMO pvp to me seems like it's inevitably guaranteed victory for the player who does nothing but pvp all day long
Ganking all around!
hi
how are things LunasGuard
Namely because it is.
Heya LunasGuard
13at least in tf2, while exceedingly unlikely, you can still get hosed by a day one player
Turned from best pony discussion to best PVP stratedgy. HUMANITY!
very good alexxm
But nowadays in WoW the dedicated PvPers are generally kept in their own upper bracket.
how u doing MLP_Brovakiin
But Shizuka, then we get players like you, who are completely OP in their class and completely unstoppable.
i
And the lower PvP is all about who rolled the right class when they started.
Where's the fairness there?
hi
Good thanks LunasGuard, how about you?
Well Rei you stop sucking and learn to play.
great thanks 4 asking MLP_Brovakiin
I'd think of kinder words to phrase that with but I'm not in the mood to.
13silly rei i am quite stoppable
Shizu: Oddly enough, this is why I love GW2's WvW. >_>
13pyro vs heavy doesn't end well
Its fine LunasGuard :)
Anything vs heavy doesn't end well from the front.
i liked the pvp system in wow until cata. it took practice and experience, and then it was quite fun
I wandered into it, and on day one, I straight up assassinated a few dozen people. >_>
I play Demoman.... Pyros are mean :'(
never played cata so
Hold on, I forgot the :P on the end of my last sentence.
And I am back
To win at WoW pvp, roll a rogue or a frost mage.
You ricked him Wrek!
Lol
/me prefers Engi because she can be lazy, upgrade, shoot people from the sentry and listen to her dispenser radio
Meanwhile: is it safe to say Rogues are fucking OP in Pvp?
I would think so
Since I used to play a rogue, yeah you can say that.
They can stack shit loads of debuffs on you
huh, i remember killing rogues very easily in wotlk as a pally
>Played pally in Wrath.
I played an Ele shammy. People hated me in PvP :D
Well I hate you now.
>QQ pls
I never got into Pvp
Nor did I
Go bubble hearth you ret git.
The matches got too bullshit
Meanwhile: Guess what
And this is where I back into the corner
They removed bubble hearth?
lol u mad. fyi i never bubble hearthed, but i would do it jsut for the sake of all the delicious rage
i just did bubble+rocket boots
Blizz made a glyph that increases hearth speed by 50% when you use divine shield
AV is best BG!! >_>
then i came big and kileld everyone
What.
Who be stremin'?
No joke
Theres a actual glyph that does that
CrazyCherry: Wrek be streamin.
They...they added...that...the...
I don't even.
Wrek: Hejsan!
hahaha
Wrek be tired
blizzard trolled you
oh wow
i just noticed
Meanwhile: http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=115933/glyph-of-righteous-retreat
thats an AWESOME desktop
Why would you make bubble hearthing a legitimate thing.
BEHOLD
haaaahahahahahaha
AND DISPAIR
wut... just got a torchlight gift copy
It was bad enough when you had pallies running away like little girls
pally is best class lololo
oh please
But encouraging them to do so? that's just weird, especially for blizz.
I never used it to be honest
like wussy rogues running away are better
:o
Also trying to kill as a Holy paladin sucks
CASTLE CRASHERS
I no longer have Cosencrate or exorcism
and i never used it either. i did bubble+rocket boots though
I used to love rocket boots.
Dat Lyra Steam Icon.
hey hey hey Discord is here t play
All I have for damage spells are Divine strike, holy shock, and jugement
all the people who rage over pallies running away are just butthurt cuz they cant kill them. as if any sane player would stick around to get killed
*wouldnt
I quit being engi before MoP launched
*no wait, would
Engi had shit worth keeping it for and alot of it kept malfunctioning
i sure forget what i write quickly
I always hated PvP tbh.
I only played PvE at a high level.

Ohai RAWRity
Farming in Wow is interesting to say the least
not seen you in a while
/me throws RAWRity off a 10 story window
how are things RAWRity
hi RAWRity
All this talk about WoW....
HAh
YES
ohai wow
wow? time to go play borderlands
Dat login....wut
mother bucker, he's playing WoW
I'll be on Gaia Online...probably...if you need me
im in love
Pfft. Und dann WoW was on stream.
What realm are you guys on?
Yep
I am In Cairne
ASoftFluffyThing: Gaia? you poor son of a bitch
Name is Vandoll the Pally
Urgh, I'm being haunted by nostalgia.
Anvilmar here
RAWRity: I haven't been on there in 5 years
mists of Panda|Drawing ria
You know what bothers me? Stormwind still hasent fucking fixed the statue
Gaia is possibly the worst run site I've ever seen.
And what happened to his hotbar?
dat twilight
Mmmm, dat mount
Stormwind hasn't fixed fucking anything.
I don't get the appeal behind WoW, honestly. I really don't.
twilight_sprinkle XD
hai Panda|Drawing :3
I ONLY reason I wanted MoP....was take Garrosh's damn head!! :[
*was to
Panda|Drawing: Oh, there you are. XD
Garrosh is a dick
never even played it, nows my chance to be edumacated
I understand Wow's appeal as much as any other MMO
I liked Garrosh better when he was a whiny bitch in Nagrand.
Dafuq is that thing?
Does anyone think the Cross realm idea is total shit?
I've never even touched it. I see it in the store and roll my eyes at it
I do
getting borderlands 2 on xbox tomorrow
hello twilight_sprinkle :3 how are you hun?
LunasGuard: Wewt!
>never touched the game
So where the hell is Thrall in all of this?
>says they don't understand the appeal
Now he's a whiny racist bitch in Org with bigorexia.
>what
05SpadeMagnes[School]: i dont
Klumzeedragon: /)
05cause i see the intent and pontential, and doesnt whien about issues that are obviously bugs
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #578
Panda|Drawing: ehh, screwed up my last math quiz. worst two quizzes are dropped, meaning i have to be careful on the next ones. what about you?
Yay, drawfriendstuff
So can some one explain how the hell the Skyfire can still fly?
RAWRity: With what money am I supposed to buy the thing, and what computer which require said money that I don't have?
It took a fucking beating in Dragon Soul
LunasGuard: (\ What class you pickin?
twilight_sprinkle, ah, yeah, last night I bombed a test too >.< but meh, ill do better next time. I'm just drawing, as usual ^^
ASoftFluffyThing: if you don't want to play it, fine. But don't say something sucks unless you've actually played it.
Dragon Soul set the Skyfire ON fire entirely nine times out of ten during the Heroic Blackhorn fight.
and then Wrek's Viking pony is in drawfriend stuff
Klumzeedragon: assassin
Look at that Wrek. You made drawfriend again. :D
What type of creature class are the sha?
05LIINK
Panda|Drawing: what test?
Seriously did anyone elses Hc Blackfire encounter just set everything alight on every other attempt?
My holy attacks WRECK EVERY ONE OF THEM
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/drawfriend-stuff-578.html
twilight_sprinkle Social Psychology.
I wonder how huge the Sha of Fear is
Wrek: Last link from dari bot
yup, Number 7
The sha of doubt was pretty big
Panda|Drawing: ah. ill probably take that eventually
SpadeMagnes[School]: Probably not as huge as Al'akir.
Or Thunderaan.
how are you twilgiht_sprinkle
Or the Qiraji Colossi.
Or Maws.
So Al akir is dead right?
RAWRity: I didn't say that it sucks. I just said that I don't see the appeal behind it. Probably because when it came out, just about everyone was playing it. (And the small bit of jealousy I had for those who did have it and were having fun >.>)
Meanwhile: my brother was at the opening of ahn qiraj
interesting shit
LunasGuard: Awesome. :) I have an Assassin and a Commando
I still have the scepter in my bag.
Meanwhile: you opened it on your server?
is it actualy possible to kill a elemental permamently?
btw, ASoftFluffyThing I believe they offer a free trial if you want to cut your teeth on it.
Never did get the chance to actually use the stupid thing though.
Meanwhile: so you got the scepter, but didnt open the gates?
nuu twilight vanquisher, kill him!
I finished the scepter quest during Wrath, so no.
twilight_sprinkle O_o you will?
Meanwhile: oh
RAWRity: The trial is 30 days, right? I forgot how long it is.....plus I can't play it without a new mouse
ASoftFluffyThing 7 days
Klumzeedragon: sad that I didn't preorder
Can some one explain why Wrek's bar is all weird?
I used to pray that the gate would bug and check on it every day.
SpadeMagnes[School]: You ever hear of addons?
I only use DBM
O-o what the hell?
Panda|Drawing: yeah. i need o take some boring general education classes like history,english and stuff. but psychology and philosophy should be interesting
Pfft, only use DBM.
Im not kidding
Inception is weird O__o
I had DBM, Omen, Recount, Bartender, and like 4 others I don't even know the name of.
I have never had to use any other add ons,
twilight_sprinkle, psychology is definitely interesting, hence why its my major ^^
LunasGuard: Aw. Still gonna buy the Mechromancer for 800 points?
Panda|Drawing: Aaaaaaaaaah not enough. I'll give it a shot. If it turns out I do like it and was bashing because of the popularity, I'll save up.
Panda|Drawing: cool, what kind of stuff do you study there?
I'm not happy that Judgment is fucking usless now
Unfortunately, I tend to do that :<
They took away the seal of insight mana regen for it
Klumzeedragon: yes
I wasn't happy when they removed our ability to craft our own poison.
Pointless? maybe, but it made it feel more interesting.
Also alot of the gear I'm getting lacks spirit
so guys
Which is shit
THERES A BACON SHORTAGE!!!!!!!! :'(
Who cares.
"Gangnam Style" is now the #2 song in the United States.
Bacon is meh anyway.
Kipkat07_USAF: aw sheet :O
Meanwhile: Dewhaaaaaaaaaaa
What creature type are the sha?
RAWRity: im surprised its only №2. but on the bright side its dying out slowly
the fuck is number one?
twilight_sprinkle: "dying out"? what weird, parralel universe are you living in?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maroon 5 song
RAWRity: ive already heard a lot of people say theyre tired of it
And then Party City commercial comes on. Reminding me to figure out what I'm going to be for Halloween
I really need to build a Ret spec just for questing
twilight_sprinkle: doesn't mean it's dying out. It went from #11 to #2, beating out songs from hugely popular artists. It ain't going anywhere for a while.
I was SHIT at dps
I could barely do 3K in cata :(
RAWRity: well it got famous very fast, but i think itll also become old news pretty fast. yeah itll be played a lot on the radio, but i dont think people will care for it much longer
Only problem is... I dont know how to build my dps spec
Panda|Drawing: is there a lot of biology involved?
I havent used a dps spec in months
Wrek I might not buy that Alpha squad thing for PS2. Every time I go to purchase it today, it sends me to my account options. I'm pretty much getting quite mad at the fact from all these errors that it is starting to put me off the game.
Does anyone have talent advice for making a Retrobution Paladin?
SpadeMagnes[School]: You should probably try Elitist Jerks.
I only plan on using it for questing
twilight_sprinkle, of course :) but so far only when it directly effects cognitive ability. like inhereted traits and what not. other than that im not sure if i'll come across it much. cant be too sure though.
wow, 32k hits. back in wotlk that was enough to kill almsot any player
Aha, there.
in tbc to kill some three times
I've made my case. :3
Has anyone encountered the Darkmoon rabbit yet?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2we7mji4M1r5yhbco1_500.png
LunasGuard, so do I?
Did you say use a credit card or a debit card? I have to use a debit.
Had some dude arguing with me that GW2 is harder to level up in than WoW. So I, being a math teacher, gave him a math lesson and then cracked him across the jaw with a yardstick for giving me sass. :3
CK|Ded XD
It takes awhile just to get to 86
Panda|Drawing: ah. cuz i remember going to a psychology olympiad(like a competition) without preparing or even knowing about it until 2 hours prior, i remember there were some biology-like quetions. i got 3rd place anyway :D
Panda|Drawing: hell, i didnt even study psychology :D
Yeah, but WoW's XP curve gets really stupid at Lvl 86.
Its a good thing I have a shit load of cata gear I used for transmog
http://ponyconfessions.tumblr.com/ go confess ur sins
twilight_sprinkle ^^ hehe awesome. what were you tested on? I mean, only 2 hours of preparation, I couldnt imagine you had a grasp of the many theoriums that are out there.
howdy everypony, is this the new WoW?
I have enough for at least almost a full set
Panda|Drawing: i didnt prepare for it either :D
Michael: ello
/me hugs LunasGuard
Alas Poor Sock
And then I forgot what I was supposed to be doing.
I had it in my head before I drank the last of the orange juice
Panda|Drawing: there werent many theorem quesitons though, it was mostly stuff like "what affects this type of judgement" or "what part of the brain controls this type of judgement" and "how to make these guys make peace". so pretty easy stuff, just needed logical thinking
twilight_sprinkle xD that say more about the other contestants XD
Incidentally, while writing my case, I realized that GW2 is probably TOO easy to level in.
It pisses me off none of the quest gear I got so far HAS NO SPIRIT
is this the new WoW?
I fucking need Spirit!
You can run 15 events at Lvl 79 and poof, you're Lvl 80. >_>
Wrek is best DK
ah, twilight_sprinkle, seems mostly to do with social psychology. Wait until you start picking around the brains of those who suffer from schizophrenia and psychosis ;)
well, dat was easy
brb
Panda|Drawing: yeah, that id prefer to not think about <.<
You need a lot of spirit now, but none of the fucking gear they give me has any
It's a ratio that's so absurd that WoW would need to give 320k XP per quest just to match the GW2 pace. Which makes me think it's really too easy to level in GW2. XD
The shit
twilight_sprinkle, meh, to each his own. I mean, I want to get a back ground in criminal justice as well, so studying dangerous mental conditions is something ill have to do.
... so, the FF6 OCRemix Kickstarter got over 45k , I cgot an e-Mail with the following messege:
twilight_sprinkle, ah, well, it just interests me because I have close family members who suffer from it. and well... me now understanding it all just drove my curiosity :)
Panda|Drawing: i know its rather interesting, but i dont like thinking about those things. makes me feel nutty too :P
Also I have yet to upgrade my axe
do u play as a new race in the new WOW?
I had the Axe of Purification for all of Cata
twilight_sprinkle haha i know what you mean :)
they added a new race?
"We reached 45k , now every Pledger with 50$ or more will get a Copy of the FF7 Album too" included in the mail was a Picture of XZibit "Yo, I heard you like FF, so we put FF7 in your FF6 so you can FF7 while you FF6" ...
hey hey hey!

That's the only knowledge I have of WOW :p

Odd... I expected to get a shit load of pings when pandaria came out. Heh, guess I misjudged XD
How do you kill that which has no life?
everyone at my school says its nerdy, but what is the definition of "nerdy"?
Panda|Drawing: well your name has |drawing right now, so :P
all dat skill bars
twilight_sprinkle, the way my client is set up, it pings me on "panda"
"Nerdy" (noun): the art of being too much of a baws for normal people
Panda|Drawing: ah, well idk then :P chat isnt very lively atm
I'm watching someone play wow..
xD seems that way twilight_sprinkle :)
Panda|Drawing: It's only just come out. Give it some time and I'm sure you'll consider switiching. XD
CK|Ded: oh, seems logic!
playing games can be fun, i like COD its competitive and fun
Server?
but damn the hackers!

alexxm, isn't that something from Neopets?
nope CrimsonPhoenix
CrimsonPhoenix: :D
oooh nevermind
I haven't heard of most things
White ranger tiger power.
looks pretty boring this game
WoW isn't really a spectator game.
Meanwhile: figures
I don't even know what's going on
Happy bday google
uh really? i get a girls gone wild add when entering bronystate? and you wonder about the parents saying mlp is bad for kids

CrimsonPhoenix: hes trolling
I've noticed

Untrue, I'm questioning everything.
twilight_sprinkle: you know fibunacci and stuff like that
Eli: hmm. integrals and derivatives?
Hey, Shizuka. Which is better for MvM? Degreaser or backburner?
Meanwhile: its not untrue, its false
Eli: never heard of fibunacci
13personally i prefer degreaser for the switch time to detonator/ax
Meanwhile, actually that reminds me of kids
Ah, alright. Ty
13backburner probably works well but horribly nerfs your airblast ability because ammo
and their incredible curiosity
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, he was kinda awesome... like some egghead
If it's not true, then it's false, which is untrue...
but false sounds cooler

mentallyeffedguy: just read ur name :D
Eli: whats your specialization?
Pfft, untrue sounds better.
I dont play pyro much, but I didnt want to scrap the better Item.
Wrek looks so amused by playing this game
LunasGuard: hope you got a laugh :D
twilight_sprinkle: pff specialisation... it would be accounting, but i hate that stuff
mentallyeffedguy: rocl

Hi Nittany_Discord *dusts*

No advancened RP's at all ^^
But cookies are never a bad thing!
mentallyfedguy not pshyically, but emotionally yes
hi Nittany_Discord
I don't know of anyone here who RPs
twilight_sprinkle now i know how Doug Walker felt when he watched......Doug
By the way....what did you mean yeterday about being a brom?
did it hurt emotionally that you broke the drawer? or because youre mom blamed you?
If thats what I remember it was called
mentallyfedguy the latter
both of them actually
brony
ohai Nittany_Discord :)
iT WASN'T MY INTENTION
Hi Nittany_Discord

Bronysith: that doesnt seem legit tbh
Eli: I already went to sleep. :P
twilight_sprinkle: well it is
Bronysith: lets ask the pro
whos playing?
Dark92Enigma: as long as you're not like dexter. (if we mean the same dexter)
yeepp, oh well though
hey Nittany_Discord is this legit http://i.imgur.com/5TbAH.jpg
you should give it a try ^^
Wow... The screen is really full of text flying around xD
Eli as in the boy genius or the serial killer?
One of these days ill check it out
Dark92Enigma: my father is excessively hostile when anything is done wrong so
Dark92Enigma: second one
http://imgur.com/D3kgx
twilight_sprinkle: Yes.
It's volcano-triggered lightning.
Eli oh good, i meant the boy genius
ohh so thats where the red is from
Or lightning sparked by an ash cloud. That ash cloud is from a Chilean volcano.
twilight_sprinkle: told you
Bronysith: and?
Bronysith: i don't think that's something to make fun of...
A Chilean Volcano!?
Before im killing myself for being bullied, i would kill the bully xD
Nittany_Discord: how can you its chilean?
FUCK guys, Inception is making me trip out D:
Seen it before.
I know there are volcanos in here, i'm not that stupid :D
Dragonmatte: So you'd be Columbine.
there a pony on my sceen aaaaa
in my country*
about.. 5years now ^^
http://i.imgur.com/5Es9e.jpg
something: isn't it wonderful? :3
nice
how did he get that pony
something: its a program
Its been...maybe 4 years for me
Brad[Laptop]: that's the moment it turns from fandom to obsession
yep :P
I think there are 2 pony references in MoP
were do i get it
Maybe moar
something: google "desktop ponies" :)
Nittany_Discord: so the red in that pic is lightning igniting dust in the air?
and i should be in bed. you're really hard to get away from, you know that?
brb
Eli: IKR
rping as well?
It's the light from the lightning flashes reflecting off of the ash.
http://i.imgur.com/5Es9e.jpg
One does not simply kill the metall
Eli: I know that feel
for the most part, my sarcastic behaviour is being caused by either my mom's hostility, or my dad's negativity.......
wow
AJIsAwesome|Tired: well, you look tired :3
ohohoh the things i find in /r/wtf
who knew ashes were so reflective
Eli: :P
Dragonmatte: in Borderlands 2's credits they mention Fluttershy :3
Eli: Just got back from college classes.
MadSurge: Yah, i've seen that too! :3
wat MadSurge
Dark92Enigma: yeah i kno dat feel
AJIsAwesome|Tired Tired is still in your nickname
Dark92Enigma: I know.
hes still tired.
:P
Ohoo this song :3

yep
thats where it turns from fandom, to obsession.
and I dont know if thats a guy or a chick.
bye Dark92Enigma
What makes this show so good?
Master of Noodles.
Not the most imposing title in the world is it.
Bronysith: Reminds me of that one Garfield comic strip.
Michael|Progamming: one of the programmers thanked her :3 bronies are everywhere!
the writing, characters, animation
MadSurge: i saw it :D
especially the characters
watch a few episodes and see if you like it.
Bronysith: welp. be happy the comic ends before the rape starts
Its just a bunch of ponies right?
yep
hmm...
I'm starting to wonder if there is some collectable market for MLP
yes
its very big
and lots of $$$ into it.
Oh really? I might start researching it
xD
"Mothafucka." xD
I always like getting collectables, wasnt expecting MLP to be one of em
very big is an understatement
But really, watch the first 5 episodes of season 1 and after that make a judgement if you like it or not.
Is it like pokemon?
it'll become bigger than pokemon soon
Until I see MLP condoms ill believe it
The first 2 episodes are a bit difficult to get through, they seem a little girly to some people
I liked them though.
later everypony hope to see all of u friday
bye
hello every pony and good bye LunasGuard
BYe, LunasGuard :)
Im not heavily invested in mlp collectables.
Hi, Dovah :)
Heya Dovah

rdibp: Wrek.
O_o
It's hard to tell since he does not have his glasses one.

thats enough browsing /r/wtf
Gnight everypony gtg sleep
wut desktop ponies is in the list of websites with potentially dangerous content.
take care ^^
bye Michael
Night Michael
Pony. Not even once.
Night Michael :)
something: so the website for desktop ponies did not re up its domain.
Hopefully it didnt make things worse
They forgot to pay for their website, or did not care to do it
YOu gona have to hope some one uploads it for jo.
or something
http://cheezburger.com/6614393344
i'd like thosse mind bullets
mind bullets are best bullets
something: it might be up on ponychan, but going there you get 403 and 404 errors.
its borked
Barbetos|AtWork iirc they were hosted in godaddy wich got attacked by anon site has been down since then aparently
i cant do it
Shenlong?
im going to sleep
yeaaah. SOme one going to have to upload it for you.
something: night
Night, something :)
Goodnight.
bye something
tha ingame sound?
05y
Wait so who's streaming right now?
wrek is
Kk
/me noms AJIsAwesome|Tired
/me squeeks
So just out of curiousity
NOONE here has played skylanders yet?
I have
Were you planning on getting the sequal?
Pony tags in Jet Set Radio. Yep. I need that game now.
Maybe
PSvita
I barely have any skylanders -sigh-
i dont know why this song is so awesome... it jus is
it seems to me like manufactures make a goldmine off pony related references in games, tv shows, etc
haters hate but continue buying the game
publicity spreads, free pr
bronies buy the gmae for no reason other than "haz poniez"
Barbetos|AtWork: Wait, what?
Pony tags in JSR?
see my rationale for why it makes sense, AJIsAwesome|Tired
That's it, I need to buy that game ASAP.
what'S jet set radio?
there's no downside to mentioning ponies
sorry for being quiet guys
kinda working on stuff
Its best to buy them when they are on sale :)
it's an automatic win for the publishers
I think I've got a shahansha kicking around.
free pr, bronies buy your games
publicity over game spreads amongst anti-brony, brony, and general net culture groups
hey everypony :) sup?
it's free marketing and free sales
we get the idea, you're going in loops
Jet set radio has a custom tag designer.
Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
So let me get this straight. Wrek's picture got posted on EQD?
you're right.
That's kind of cool
link?
on another topic, isn't jet set radio a sega game?
Yep
i thought sega stopped making retail games other than osnic?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/drawfriend-stuff-578.html #7
No, they just haven't made any other retail games beside SOnic in a long time.
ah
and football manager
Hey everypony sup wrek
Sega needs some variety.
Hi, Moopy :)
Heya Moopy
they're co-producing Bayonetta 2
oh yeah, and wreks art popping up on eqd is no unusual
but nintendo is publishing
they jus never ask before the post
Probably not unusual, but unusual for me to spot it
Hey wrek my step dad is playing wow to
I used to play WoW. Fun times, but my bro moved on.
where did he go?
Same with CoD.
I wasn't obessed with it, but it was okay for the time being.
i play mario kart
3ds is best dss
I needed something to play, and CoD filled the void.
pony related ofc
I don't know. Got frustrated with the raid dismissals, among other horrible endgame problems
11,02i liek CoD ^-^
DAT CHARMY
AJIsAwesome|Tired, i got a gaming pc recently
Otherwise I stuck with it until Wrath of the Lich King.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: look up mechwarrior 4 mercenaries. it'S abandonware and thus free
been playing sonic generations
and sonic colors on wii
I think on and off for 5 years. My brother and I moved onto Lord of the Rings Online after that
I like ponies
Says everything anyone needs to know Super.
ryaxnb: I love Generations. However I would've liked som DLC.
me too
11,02Meanwhile: :<
Shibaru, brony? ;3
AJIsAwesome|Tired: lol ikr :D
Well thats a first...
really is a gorgeous game too
http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/sonic-generations/screenshots/gameShotId,558992/
lol
I'm quite amused by being able to make you sad with only one sentence.
I like cookies
the sonic engine is a beast
That has to be the first Caramel/Twilight fic I ever saw...
What?
SpadeMagnes[R]: i saw quite a few
Anypony in here plays WoW also besides wrek?
never read em though
Is Reikim here? Aw. I wanted to tell him I looked at White Box fic
What is going on with Wrek's bag?
Add on?
what it about flutter_spin
But I dislike sad/tragedy/dark fics like that one.
SpadeMagnes[R]: probably
AJIsAwesome|Tired, which platform do you play generations on?
05goan call it a night
ryaxnb: PS3.
Personally I dont see how add ons like those help
Wrek: Sleep welL! :)
It just looks messy to me
i play on PC
ryaxnb: Lucky.
05of streaming
windows xp sp3/Core2Quad/Radeon7750
Goodnight Wrek
sleep tight wrek
ryaxnb: You can download modded levels.
Sleep well and thanks for the stream Wrek
05not going to bed yet
sega's pc port engine is pretty awesome, incidentally
Thanks for streaming Wrek.
oh sorry
Does anyone else have that shield that looks like Deathwing's face?
Wrek: Well you need to. :P
it supports running in 1080p/60fps/AA
whereas the 360 game is 720p/30fps/noAA
alexxm: In a sense, it is about a story of someone who knows almost nothing. The google doc shows off some color text and suddenly he learns the truth about his past and the world around him
unfortunately, i need a faster computer to go all the way to 1080/60/AA
00,03It's time!
Adventure time?
but if i did, it would look absolutely insanely good
alexxm: But the context of the story and the dreaded ending... I just couldn't bare it.
Scoot-Scootaloo time?
to d-d-d--d- duel
ryaxnb: People have been making their own levels. You should check them out.
i will
it's time?
computers always get da mods
that's what made the sims a blast
hold on what's going on
i remember sims 1 modded objects were EXTREMELY common
I wonder how hard Alagon was during the early days of Wrath
sims 2 it was more a focus on game mods
DAT INTERVIEW
Who?
flutter_spin: think i read that one. the one with the drawing pony?
well that;'s the chat dead ^^
than modded objects
*cough* http://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/ *cough*
both were great games and had some of the best mod communities on the pc
who is this?
anyone here a sims fan?
Dark_Horst: yeah
wait on the right is that gigabit dude?
ryaxnb: Me
ASoftFluffyThing|Nap, isn't it neat how the PC versions of Sims can be completely different thanks to mods, packs, and DLC?
it's just like amazing what modders & EA alike did with the Sims 1 and Sims 2 engines well past their prime
is that voice Dex from Sanity not Included? sounds kinda like him
modders made an apartment mod for Sims 1
ryaxnb: I knooooooooooooow. On one of my laptos, I had like over 3000 downloaded items for Sims 3
No lie
Sketch_Toku_Brony, I thought of that
you know Apartment Life?
Modders actually had implemented that in Sims 1 with hacked objects
it was a neat tech demo
whos this guy?
Whoa! Wuthering Heights movie is coming out?
tfkhg fkgfkjfkjgfkjgfkjgfhgff hgjhgjhg hgk jhg g f jggf f jhgjh g
That's just...freaky
It's Samrose.
Wait is that lordflamgexfire that used to be on my friends that blocked me?
Get to hear my horrid voice again.
I never played the Sims 1. Didn't have a computer at the time and the few Sims 2 games I've played were for PS2
hm, never heard of him
didn't have a computer?
But I am going tot akes a nap. Later, guys
you should try sims 2!
Nittany_Discord Don't worry mate, I bet mine is worse >_<
bye ASoftFluffyThing|Nap
its' got the most fan mods of all the games!
Bye ASoftFluffyThing|Nap
Nittany_Discord: which one of those is you
nappy later.
I don't like my voice. :D
ryaxnb: Will Sims 2 work on computers with Windows 7?
yes, but not win8
though i'm sure they'll fix that bug (mod community will)
windows 7 works fine.
ryaxnb: aaah okay. Well I'll talk to you later because the couch is calling my name :3
bye sleep well
Isn't this Samrose a.k.a Jake Heritagu?
Wait, where did Scoots go?
I'm semi working on something right now sorry

what is this, did not see this coming
Busy...
still didnt red it
Yeah, who's being interviewed?
*read
Don't really read fanfics.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: well, there a few real dieamonds out there. finding them is hard though
Ok.
I probably wouldn't cry.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: try FO:E
I haven't legitimately cried in years.
dead island theme?
takes husge amounts of time
hes interviewing this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQCsh_Ryu0c
but it's worth every minute
it does what it's made to do
^
and i usually stay away from sadfics anyway. nothing really interesting there
^
I'm not into sad fics.
I'm trying to read "Keeping your Hooves on the Ground", but it
*it's hard to.
OH, the MLD movie guy
I dont read fanfics, but I like to see more fan content produced. its cool.
^
I doubt its actually going to happen though
a lot of announcements but not much happening...
i just keep recommending FO:E to everyone
it's a fanfic, but quality and story-wise, it's on par with many "real" books out there
FO:E?
fallout: equestria
ah
Dark_Horst, I wouldn't mind if I was a fan of Fallout
but sadly I am not
....that i'm a huge sucker for fallout 3 probably helps, but hey, it's awesoem anyway
CrimsonPhoenix: you dont have to be a fan of fallout
Yaaaay. Now I have a Strange Scottish Resistance :3
it works great on its own
Dark_Horst, I still don't think it'll catch my interest
^
CrimsonPhoenix: maybe you'd be surprised. give it a shot
eh.
its worth a try
Dark_Horst, please don't enforce it
if I'm not interest I am not
just saying
O_O
MLD with characterization?
Maybe it won't be that horrible
welp, my sister uninstalled steam....:(
I figured it was you
rdibp: Hm? Why?
idk
It was too good of a deal to pass up
rdibp, is she a gamer?
Just reinstall it.
no
do you have steam on yours?
i never even used steam that much anyway
I see
is this Robcakeran?
(I'm fluttershy but a unicorn)
Eh, guys, gotta go to bed. Goodnight, and *BWUUUUM*
well that was odd
night, MadSurge :)
bye MadSurge

I have no idea how to serch. i'm sorta new to BS
Wtf is going on?
Interview.

DerpyWhooves: life
BRB
Brony Filmmaker.
Brony Filmmaker?
Yes.
That's not his name, though.
mld?
What is his name?
wait, hes going to make a movie about rd without knowing how to animate? i may have missed something tho
Jenomorph.
can't believe its been 157 days since season 2 ended.
IT HAS!?
twilight_sprinkle: Pretty sure he has animators doing that for him, I think.
How lazy.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: i thought he said he did everything himself
He did?
Hm.
i thought so
brb guys
Hmm, very few people here.
05mmm oreos that arent oreos but work the same way and doesnt taste of chemicals
^
^^:S
Wrek: where can i find those?
oh i swear to you, I'll be there for you, this not a drive by i i I I i ~
O,,,O
ALRIGHT, GUYS. WE NEED ANIMATERS!
^^^
MY Little Dashie is funny.
rdibp: Needs more Zoidberg.
wut :I
O_O
/me 08,01hugs Wrek
animators. shouldn we have some of thsoe?
Oh my, sounds like he doesn't give a sh*t.
08,01i has a stroopwafels
^?
08,01dat meeeee! \o/
The interviewer or doesn't sound lke he cares.
Stroopwafels?
08,01AJIsAwesome|Tired: waffly syrupy dutch tings
08,01*things
Ah.
Okay.
i though that sounded up north
AJIsAwesome, how old are you?
And I have returned
DerpyWhooves: Why?
Cause, I'm a pedophile and I need to know these things.
Sup yall im back from riding my bike
Nah, I was just wondering.
Derpy_Hooves: :S
/me 08,01nuzzles DerpyWhooves
08,01i'm 12.
Welcome back, Moopy :)
When was this Living in Oblivion movie made? I never heard of it
08,01DerpyWhooves: as serious as i ever am
there was a time when someone would say their age and the whole chat just spill theirs
:D
there were so many numbers
Dark_Horst: Yesterday? :D
I'm not here often, so I don't know how serious you are.
AJIsAwesome|Tired: naw, that was a dribböe
NOOUU LAGGG
*dribble
o.o
So what determines how much game fps your computer uses? the graphic card?
08,01DerpyWhooves: how old are you?
didnt even realize :D
HMM. THAT'S SOME PERSONAL INFORMATION.
08,01whoops
08,01i mean SpadeMagnes[R]
08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: that was the short answer
08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: would you like the long answer?
it's not personal when millions of people are also that age :p
08,01(hint: i'm a computer scientist. you really don't want the long answer.)
OMG CANZ I DO RDDDDDDDDD
MY AGE IS nein nein nein
Well my dad says the ram and cpu dont mean jack shit or the ammount of data it can hold
And I dont buy that
I think your Dad is an idiot.
Sorry.
He uses a Mac to boot
SpadeMagnes[R]: your dad is an idiot
SpadeMagnes[R] cpu and ram are quite important
Extremely.
I had to argue the hell out of it to make him get me a desktop
Very important.
go on
also
Chrysalis_: Oh, mai........;)
08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: mostly, it's the graphics card, but cpu and ram do also have an effect on framerate
Well, luckily he did. (Right?)
Yea he told me it doesnt matter how much cpu it has
/me 08,01nuzzles Chrysalis_
hai Chrysalis_ long time no see
08,01Chrysalis_: are you sure? i'm going to start talking about memory latency and associative caches...
I want WoW to be able to run at decent fps
So basically, this guy is making a movie about My Little Dashie?
Thought he said Crackle. :D
The most i get is 12-17
TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah, been in london for work the last week
AJIsAwesome, i'm pretty sure he did.
The fps utterly tanks when alot of shit is on screen
08,01Chrysalis: for badly written games, yes
DerpyWhooves: No, he said "crack".
which are very heavy IO dependant
08,01Chrysalis: heh, aye; as i said, badly written games
Goodnight everyone :)
He was talking about the crack in her voice.
NIght, Foal_Brovakiin :)
night Foal_Brovakiin :)
bai Foal_Brovakiin
Tru dat.
Also my dad is such a fucking Apple purist
HOLY
dat yay
wow
How can he do that?
He said the Mac was better than regular computers
He just can.
He didnt even give a god damn reason
Mac's are pretty bad for gaming, from what I've heard.
SpadeMagnes[R]: well, that seals the idiot theory
SpadeMagnes[R] your dad is not so IT literate
08,01Chrysalis: the BUCK twitter is BronyUKCon, and yes, i have control over it
please dont link to more stores, my bank account is looking rather sad
I really don't care about what the interview is talking about.
I ask him why does he think macs are so great he says "They just are"
macs are bad at gaming becasue they horribly overprice their hardware
simple as that
08,01<3
And he says a mac wont break down as fast as other comps
i bought the luna off the store you linked the other day within about an hour of you linking it
buy a 2000 dollar desktop, it will laugh at state of the art graphics
Well all he uses it for is web browsing
buy a 2000 dollar desktop, you're lucky if it can run minecraft
*mac
lulz, dark_horst
DerpyWhooves: dont you dare
I bought an 11 inch macbook air for the sole purpose of watching tv shows and movies in bed at night.
"Don't you dare" what?
dark_whorst?
SpadeMagnes[R]: and that is why he doesnt know jack about what he'S talking
sup everypony
Hay
ello Freefall29
Hi, Freefall29
hi Freefall29 :)
what are we watching
Interview.
08,01i've just put together a really sweet gaming machine for someone for about £900
what interview is this for
I just love how little the interviewer cares about this.
Yea... so all the arguments he said werent reasonable or facts were true...
He's just like, "IDGAF"
what movie are they talking about
DerpyWhooves: jumping a typing error to put falsified arguments in this debate. i know youn wanted to. i can smell you grinning fro here
Needs some music, it's so... boring.
08,01Chrysalis: what spec?
I built a gaming pc a year ago with an i7-2600k, 2x crossfired radeon 5850s, 120gb ssd for <$900
Welp! Back to reading Dark Id lp's from the Archive!
Wha...?
quad 4.2GHZ, 250GB SSD 6870
/me is confused.
that'S also why you dont go for mac if you want actual performance. buy the parts seperatly, you cans ave huge amounts of money
bout 4TB in HDDs
LOL!
What pisses me off is he planned on getting me a Mac book air WITH OUT TELLING ME FIRST
When I move im probably going to build a new pc with 2x of the 7000 series cards
can someone fill me in on what movie they're interviewing about
SpadeMagnes[R] take it if its free :P
08,01i7 3820, 16gb low latency ddr3 RAM, x79 motherboard, Radeon 7870, 1TB hdd, el-cheapo case, 800W power supply
mmm do want a new GPU
I find myself spending a lot of money on power supplies because i dont want cheapo crap ones.
FlutterWonder rabiesbun edition.
16 Ram is overdoing it right now
not bad. not bad at all
plan for next paycheck is to put maybe £300 into one
8 will do just fine
16gb of ram is dirt cheap you cant afford not to get it
05TheGreatAndPowerfulT i disagree
TheGreatAndPowerfulT not really, i run 8 and have issues where i run out
I think I paid $50 for my 16gb kit
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: depends. 3dartists will need it
but he want's it for gaming not 3d art
OMG GAIZ, IS DA GREAT AND POWERFUL T!
but then, part of that was buying a new win7 license
:)
Um.......okay?
Well my WoW takes up like 20Gb or so
if you just need your pc for gaming, 8 should do. even with newest titles
I havent bought a copy of win7 ever
I wish I had windows 7.
I figure i have laptops that I have junked that came with win7 so imma just use my "license" on another pc.
I hear so many good things about it.
but multitasking could require more
see streamers
I have Vista...
Same here.
vista after the service packs isn't that bad.
Well, right now I'm using a crappy XP.
DerpyWhooves: just pirate it. easy
but I do like 7.
08,01CK|Ded: the CPU is a really good one for gaming; it's the cheapest Sandy Bridge E processor, and there are some cornerss cut, but none of them really affect gaming
08,01and i found it in a bundle deal
I probably will, but I'm gonna get help from moi fatherr
Derpy_Hooves: better upgrade soon, support for xp aint gonna last long
08,01which meant i could up the graphics card to something nicer than originally planned
08,01
Ill probably go with one of the 6 core i7s on my next build.

Hm?
Well unfortunately I'll have to hope my dad buys me a GOOD Desktop because apperently I don't get a say in what I exactly want
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Children of Faust / DJ octavia 03 / I Need This
What was that?
SpadeMagnes[R] ever consider building one?
Freefall29 stop ponging the wrong derpy
Freefall, this isn't my main computer, my main one has Vista.
I'm 16 and lack a job. how would I even do that
pinging
i tend to prefure dubs
SpadeMagnes[R] well if hes buying you stuff ask him for money instead so you can choose your own...
Wrek but you use art programms and 3d modeling programs those are heavy dependant of the Ram a gaming computer can do just fine with 8 Ram right now
No...he just keeps saying its his money so he gets to decide <.< sigh...
Hey, do you guys know any good fanfictions?
Take what you can get then and dont complain.
i have to agree with Brad[Laptop]
i dont even ask for a desktop
;)
Chrysalis haven't try win 8 so i don't have a say in that
SpadeMagnes[R]: well, thats a huge load of bullshit
08,01Brad[Laptop]: the 3820 is a fantastic little chip. it has 10MB of 20-way L3 cache, which is great for gaming performance, and makes memory latency a non-issue
I know, but its going to be the computer I'm going to be stuck with I should be allowed to have a say in for what I want
Who here likes Inception?
08,01DerpyWhooves: i do!
:D
>:l
=D
Derpy_Hooves: i do
08,01Dark_Horst: i just explained what it means
*DerpyWhooves
I just chose the 2600k because it was unlocked and a good price at about $300 when i bought it
...
08,01it increases performence
SpadeMagnes[R] beggars can't be choosers.
i got that much
08,01Brad[Laptop]: the 3820 is about £80 more, but is a *lot* better
i still dont know what you just talked about^^
I fail to see how thats relavent Brad
but i guess i had to study computer science for that
08,01Brad[Laptop]: yup
08,01can be OC'd to > 4GHz
SpadeMagnes[R] you say you want something but don't have any money for it and your mad if your dad chooses it for you.
If its going to be my personal computer for a while I should be allowed to pick one
I run my 2600k at 3.8ghz
08,01Brad[Laptop]: though, unlocking is a *really* bad idea on some of these chips
08,01the reason they're locked in the first place is because the locked cores are ones that have failed testing
I had it up at 4.3ghz
but it wasn't good i didnt get one of the good 2600ks that can go to like 5ghz
I meant unlocked multiplier and voltage controls.
Not locked cores.
08,01they get, say, a 4-core chip, and if 2 cores fail testing, they lock those 2 cores out and sell it as a 2-core chip
Wait, is there a sequel to My Little Dashie?
I guess so.
I have no idea what is going on
DerpyWhooves: yeah. unoffical but approved by the author
SpadeMagnes[R] discussing multiple things.
08,01Brad[Laptop]: ah, right; yeah, the 3280 has unlocked mults and volts
what's my lil dashie?
Fnfic
*Fanfic
SpadeMagnes[R]: we watching an interview for my little dashie: the movie, and in comments we talking about computers
AJIsAwesome|Tired, one of those sexual ones?
I know alot on how to opperate a computer but I know jack shit about the components
No. :S
strawberrie_smuckerz: fanfic. some mopy guy finds a rainbow dash. dont know more than that. there are people who love it and people who say it'S horribly overated. the usual
lol
SpadeMagnes[R] i used to be the same way, a programmer who didn't know anything about the inside of a computer lol.
strawberrie_smuckerz: in a nut shell... mld is where filly rainbow dash comes to our world and a lonely brony who has nothing left raises her for 15 years....
I think we need a Pinkamena icon, for a sad face.
dat music
Freefall29 sems to sum it up well
Lol @ "EXCLUSIVE"
ahh
I wish my parents didnt buy every god damn blueray rerelease of shit
back for five minutes, saddened to inform you, i won't be here tommorrow night, because i'm grounded for a WEEK. This means i'll miss The Dark Knight AGAIN.........

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlbDPrSjNB0&list=UUJEEBGR1_4tM3uDaXQ-Aqjw&index=22&feature=plcp
Classical music you say? what kind?
08,01Wirisme: lots of kinds
:)
what just happened
08,01i have a lot of late romantic and early 20thC music
Excellent :)
08,01quite a few of the nationalist composers
08,01impressionists, expressionists, even some wierd stuff like Hindemith
Don't know many of those. That'd be like Mussorgsky right?
Nationalist that is
08,01Nationalist woudl be like Stravinksy and Shostakovich
08,01*Stravinsky
What's your opinion on Messiaen?
u got russian
so catchy and full of 80's goodness :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEANHnqiyrU
/me Goes back to working on Art
/me is Messiaen fan
<--is watchin back to the future par 3
08,01i do quite like Messieaen
Hmmm I need to restart my computer. BRB
I'm gonna boot me up some worldcraft 3.3
Good choice Princess_Cadence :)
Nationalist is Sandvich?
le sigh. i remember all those names but nothing more. 5 years of music school wasted, even though i knew the stuff at the time :\
ive seen 1 and 2 alreddy :P
I need to listen to some Shostakovich, haven't heard much of his stuff at all
08,01but i prefer Hindemith and Penderecki
Prokofiev on the other hand :D
08,01Prokofiev and Stravinsky are two of my all-time favourites
08,01but
man i just read this kick ass shiping story on EQD
You mean early Penderecki or the neo-romantic stuff?
08,01though i harp on about that time period a lot, i have a deep, deep love of baroque and renaissance music
I quite like both
scout19_tf2: what story was it
08,01Wirisme: i prefer his neo-romantic phase, but i do quite like some of his earlier stuff
I used to have most of his symphonies, was good stuff
08,01my cello teacher when i was at school was a baroque specialist, and she imbued a love of that music in me
it was really old though/soaring hearts
I should listen to more baroque really, Bach is pretty much the only one I really love.
I'm a filly and what is this.
Oh dear god that's a wonderful crossover

BarbetosSMASH, and nope it's not that

CrimsonPhoenix what is relavent then?
Night GilDash :3
any other guesses?
No.
CrimsonPhoenix, Old World Blues in Fallout Equestria? ponyshrug.jpg
AdamTheDuck, nope
That is what I said
Oh snap, there's a Phase5, shit just got real
reminds me more of Shadowrun than Fallout
and it's not Shadowrun
i am just saying, it seems a bit... hi-tech for fallout
Notice the character in focus, who is she? How is she right now?
Look at her surronding, those creatures, what are they, what can they do?
Well Ghost from Starcraft has similar armour and hairstyle... But I think she's blonde in Starcraft...
AdamTheDuck, Kerrigan
Right
and yeah it's from starcraft
night guys
Chrysalis being a pony in this picture
Goodnight alexxm
Night alexxm
get's ambush and captured by changelings, playing the zerg
Suddenly stream :3

Ahhhh, I get it now CrimsonPhoenix
gotta know the starcraft lore for this guess

Meanwhile: start stopin! ye slag

Ohai Shizuka
ohai Shizu
Hello Shizuka
what kind of game is this
hey Shizuka
Hi Shizuka
13this is one of two technically new things i have to stream
not sure if want..
Doesn't want to watch because I havent made it that far in 4....
Hi, Shizuka
13but this first
/me kicks Meanwhile "i said stoooops!"
13because revelation is stupidly hard
/me clonks Shammy in the head with a cinderblock.
owwwww
Freefall29, Myst is one of the original ... puzzle rpgs
i didnt even kick you thar hard Meanwhile!
Ryunosuke: cool.
Yeah but yer a slag.
13the other thing i have to stream is an old classic, but requires booting a VM and wiring winamp up and bleh, too much to do
this 90's or a 2000's title
Music is so beautiful! <3
Shizuka: im digging this soundtrack
/me glares at Meanwhile "meanie head"
13prepare yourselves for cheese-sha... i mean yeesha
myst series isnt a bad series per se, I just dont prefer it myself
Hey everypony what does the scouter say about his power level?
Cheese? I hate cheese.
13myst is partially based on cheese
wht is this?
cheeze6_9
Meanwhile: I like chocolate milk.
so Mist IV is a steam punk game?
what movie is this?
Princess_Cadence, game, and It's Myst IV
Cheese: I hate you.
/me facehoofs
o.o
That patented Shizuka nod
owww i hurt my forehead
Meanwhile: I love you too.
it looks like a movie
It makes me giggle Shizuka XD
http://fav.me/d5c7yvc
I think you should be quiet little girl.
Whoa, what game is this?
Oh CrimsonPhoenix what was that pic referencing?
interesting graphicdesign
13sure it's prerendered, but this sequence puts most in-game cutscenes to shame
BarbetosSMASH, you mean with chrysalis?
VenHur, Myst IV
or the one just now?
BarbetosSMASH: shadow of the collosus
heeh you can see the one just now from the description...
CrimsonPhoenix Oh I think I get it now
Its a SC2 reference isn't it?
More like Starcraft but yes
this is like a game/movie
Well yeah.
since the story of Kerrigan's corruption was in the first one
13bzzt
Oooooh ow... ooooh ow.... oooohh ow.
Shizuka! no premature deaths! we wanna see gameplay!
Never learns
can you even die in myst?
13atrus and me go way back
13i'm sure he won't mind if i dig through all his stuff before saying hi
hehe
What's a little privacy invasion between friends.
sneeky sneeky
cause I thought it was just an exploration game where you have to click the correct stuff in the correct order to progress
13i've only saved his gravelly butt three times now
Sneaky.
wut system is this for
PC
I think.
13moment...
seeing how it's a point and click adventure, i'd say pc
/me , moments later...
13four year old sister getting into things she isn't supposed to....

star trek elite force did tha too
13gtfo google
not as complex though
lawl
dat crash
...i think
Google wants to see.
Okay, I looked up the Myst series over at Wikipedia...say to see that there were five games.
*sad
Also, I have to say, live action-ish character models in a computer generated world is stunning for it's time.
13atrus you suck at this
You know if he built this damn thing, and he's the expert on this, why doesn't HE get on the controls?
13this went faster when i tested earlier >>
brb guys. dinner
Need food. Brb.

Okay!!
Took long enough Atrus...

13ONE JOB ATRUS, DON'T BLOW UP THE THING
13BUT NOOOOOOO

Well better not stop now. Blow up all the things
So, what's the Myst series all about in a nutshell?
13i have to do everything for this man...
13let me out of d'ni shizu
This sounds overly complicated.
VenHur! teleporating books and madman!
13safe my wife and kill my father for me shizu
13save the world an entire civ will be relocating to shizu
hm, this game looks like fun, maybe i should get it

Shizuka: i take offense to the ADHD thing...

Probably should have given him an easier job.
what the hell is so fucking fascinating about a gecko in the desertß
So the necklace is weed.
nods:D
Meanwhile, seems legit
So this is live action mixed with CGI interesting
Necklace of +10 Altitude.
So I looked at Wikipedia, they said a movie based on the secound novel is at work.
What game is this?
Myst IV.
myst 4
Looks nice
pet the birdie :3
God, the enviorment of the game is so AWESOME!
I'm sorry, I can't be quiet over this, this game is SO high quality back in 2004!
big hydroelectrical power plant? PRESS BUTTONS!
whats this game about, science?
what could go wrong, right?
No, it's a point-and-click game with challenging puzzles and whatsnot.
my god, that bison burger was awesome
Sorry I keep having to do stuff on my computer adjusting settings and such
"The ending has not been written"...Hrmm...
oh cool, love puzzles, especially portal
I also switched to Google Chrome like just now so I'm testing that out right now
I also starting to LOVE the soundtrack of this game.
13sorry about it occasionally spazzing the mouse
It gives that "mysterious world" vibe and actually kind of sounds sad...
Suddenly, I'm in the middle of a thunderstorm.
13oh btw this is 1800s earth
I question the historical accuracy.
Uh-oh.....
^^
1800's Earth?
13they basically live in the middle of the new mexico desert
13so no one will find them anytime soon
wut year
Didn't you guys recognise it?
btw, i've been here for a while XD

I don't know, it's looked like more of an futuristic-like setting than an 1800s setting.
ohey FlutterMEDIC
In my honest opinions anyways.
hi FlutterMEDIC
wudis?
I wonder why
Hello FlutterMEDIC.
13and there she goes....
Shizuka, this myst?
13keep an eye on yeesha...riiiiiiiiight
Phase4 Myst IV
For a girl her age...she's kind of intelligent.
clearly victorian
That's because she lives in the Desert.
Without any peers.
myst 3 and 4 seem imposible to buy
i would even go as far as calling it steampunk
HIYA everypony
13as much as i love revelation
13i hate hate hate the puzzles
also i have to stop watching lest it get spoiled :(
Hello Bronysith
Holy cockatrice that's the most cutest thing I've seen http://fav.me/d57nytj
thouhg, not sure on the punk part. doesnt seem very ounky
olo Bronysmith
*punky
hi Bronysith :)
hi Bronysith
puzzles the puzzler
Bronysith
Shizuka: A game has its flaws sometimes. But at least the setting and music of the game are beyond words.
i thought the point of the game was puzzles
I was not amused by Google Chrome's ways on this website. FireFox seems pretty good right now
The point of this game is getting that little girl away from her hallucinogenic necklace.
....i have no idea what shizu is doing there
I'm using Chrome and it's alright for me so far...
Sure, it freezes sometimes, but just barely.
chrome is fine with this website for me too. although after the latest updates chrome seems to be memory leaking
13suddenly ocarina of time
kid, you sound HIDEOUS
good game
....My ears...
My poor ears....
Shizuka, make it stop!
mu ears bleed
I feel sorry for her brother
my
"I've got to get it perfect so it takes me back in time"
Thanks Celestia!

God, the enviorment looked more beautiful in nighttime...
Dark_Horst: speaking of resonance cascade, i just finished Black Mesa

A couple of months?
someday Bronysith, but not anytime soon... college is very busy
Midnight_Stormwing: jes, jes it is
yeah... couple months, i lurked alot though... just never said anything
Everything in Myst needs a lever.

We found Luna!

using allons-y as a greeting... kinda ironic when its french for 'lets go'
not allos
luna waved at me.
please don't do that mistake again
and yes what Midnight_Stormwing said

Well you guys are like...a year late
dammit, have Pep Band tomorrow night *rageface*
is this a scary game??
now to wait another 7 months for 5 season 2 episodes :/
05,15I see a point and click adventure of some kind...
i see a bit of puzzle there too.
You see Myst IV
SpeedyBolt, i blame discovery kids
13on thing to remember
Same.
13there are no 3d models in this game
05,15wait wut....
13everything is either a video file or static background
wat
is it going to be scary??
13so that elevator with two windows
13that's two separate videos
That's pretty impressive, actually
Interesting
Myst is quite spectacular in how it looks, yes.
05,15I just feel alone whenever I try to play Myst
speaking of static i just watched marble hornets 1 - 46
05,15So alone
Fluttercry: that's the point
D'awww
cachi01|phone: Why would you do that to yourself
I'm immune to being along, i already am

WHoops.
Nvm.
banana
cachi01|phone: I watched the first 4 or 5 episodes and couldn't continue.
:o
05,15Am I the only one that's not terrified of Slender Man? Everyone's always like "AAAWWW BRO THIS S*** IS SO SCARY" but I don't see it.
I'm a baby
^^
Never saw Slenderman scary to begin with.
05,15Even Marble Hornets is just "Well, that's awesome. Not scared though"
still reading books shizuka?
Reactor, really? this was my first time watching marble hornets lol
i still have 20 episodes to watch
buffer
DAMN YOU BUFFER!
Fluttercry, I'm sure there are other people who don't fear the Slenderman
20 entries*
I dont fear Slenderman.
Crystals
...Not in games, anyways
Snapshot
But do you fear SCP-137?
05,15For example, one of my friends played Slender and was screaming and freaking out every five seconds. So then I played it and was bored to death.
If I saw some abnormally tall guy follow me in real life, I would be scared.
On Monday I was walking to the bus and saw a bunch of slenderman notes taped to trees. I walked faster.
Reactor: good idea
Fluttercry, same here
Slenderman isnt scary because its SO predictable.
13let's see where we'll be going~
05,15Now saying that, The Weeping Angels and Amnesia scare the hell out of me
cool
who is playing
JUSTINE
its boring before the 5 notes
LET ME TASTE YOU~
But is anyone scared of SCP-137?
SpeedyBolt, I'm abnormatlly tall so im going to follow you
Crap
Garettbrony: Shizu
oh
SpeedyBolt, joing im 6,3
is this myst 2
Joking*
Oh, thank god ;p
00,03Is this FalloutShock?

/me slaps Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: :I
05,15Now, the BEN creepypasta and Mr. Widemouth...those are scary
Scoots!
^_^
oh plese not ben
I disagree on the BEN creepypasta
Never heard of Mr. WIdemouth.
Never heard of them, don't want to know.
BEN really scared the shit put of me
again, SCP-137...thoughts?
Luna in the sky with diamonds
It doesnt scare me, really.
I don't find BEN scary at all.
i do..
Fluttercry: Which one is that?
Now Majora's Mask as a game is scary, but...
i dont even want to play MM again lol
Fluttercry: im not scared of slenderman either, but one time in a dream he was there, so out of place, just appeared behind me out of nowhere, and i woke up screaming
Plz
brb guys
05,15Reactor the one with the posessed Majora's Mask game
13behold, haven~
I beat MM 3 times, after reading BEN.
13let's go!
HAVEN
again, thoughts on SCP-137
Majoras Mask is my fav zelda game, so awesome
I dont care for 12
Bronysith: /)
05,15HUZZAH!....what's Haven?
To the Scootamobile!
FlutterMEDIC: Don't you mean SCP-173?
Spectrum_Rush: (\
What's SCP-137?
ASoftFluffyThing: there it is
Yeah, don't want to know
05,15If that's the one with the statue...Dr. Who did it first
thats the Statue
This is like a rollercoaster
05,15My favorite SCP is the colony of sentient Marxist Spiders
that one was awesome
A very odd rollercoaster
i think my favorite were the tomatoes XD
SCP-173? What are SCP's
I do admit that 173 is creepy-looking but if it weren't a Euclid and a Safe instead, I'd have it as a friend. Unfortunately, concrete doesn't make for good pillows
SpeedyBolt, OH YEAH? well i.....i.....visited they disney website without my parents permissipn!
Anyone else that has tried to connect to a MLP heroes server having trouble getting on those servers?
WATCH OUT
WE GOT A BAD GUY IN THE CHAT
FlutterMEDIC what are you thoughts on scp-4445
to answer questions, go here: http://www.scp-wiki.net/
I miss my vhs
SpeedyBolt, THATS IT IM GOING TO FOLLOW YOU
Come at me, bro. :[
no
no no no
SpeedyBolt, :P
:3
Garettbrony, theres no SCP-4445
my fave SCP is 862
FlutterMEDIC what about SCP-4445-j
Fluttercry, sentient and marxist are not two words that normally belong together
05,15isn't SCP 001 God?
0,14...
You guys always make my days better :)
Fluttercry: no that's 003 IIRC
Garettbrony: there is NO SCP-4445
Dat SaxyPretender
its TV Tropes
Garettbrony: no it's SCP
Nittany_Discord Do you want me to try and connect?
SpeedyBolt, I know
Yeah. The servers aren't appearing on my server browser.

Well, okay. Sentient and marxist is certainly possible, just not sapient
Guys listen to me I got something important to ask you.

Yes CrimsonDrag- I mean CrimsonPhoenix?
well i gots to go pack for the BIG MOVE later everypony:)
13and we're going blue
Fluttercry, 0___0

http://derpy.me/RA-4p
13the crazy one :3
SIGN THIS
PLEASE
05,15Take the red one. It gets you out of the Matrix
scout19_tf2, alright. See ya later
13and now sure anyone cares .-.
Sign this and spread it

Shizuka: what game?
Bluuuuuuuuuuuue
Is this myst?
This ship kinda reminds me of Skyward Sword...
What game?
:/
05,15Myst 4
CrimsonPhoenix, :|
Crystaline_Shard: Myst 4
ah ok thanks.
Tiberium126, what
I'm not signing that petition. It's not that I'm against what it's for. It's that you shouldn't be using the federal government as your golden hammer.
CrimsonPhoenix, Signed it just for ya
Thank you
Tie to go exercise and shiz....Ill be back a bit later :P
YAC is an awful person and he shouldn't perform in any convention
*Time
Nittany_Discord They're not showing up for me either. I wish they would've posted a small notice as to why they are down.
Well, I'm going to bed. Thanks for reminding me of scary things, everyone.
I just read that thing...
im back everypony
Normally, I would have any-
Sleep well, Reactor :)
APPLES
night Reactor
apples?
05,15Honestly, I don't think people should petition to not have him perform.
Reactor, have good dreams. muhahahah
get that crab
Hope so DashWithRainbows.
Hopefully they will be back up shortly. PF2 heroes is my most played server and I don't feel like playing TF2 without being on it.
CrimsonPhoenix: it's their fault for letting him appear in the first place. you host a convention it's your own problem you want a sexist to rap at your connvention you deal with it maybe listen to some of his songs before allowing him to perform.
whys that?
:/
Crystaline_Shard, well I guess your right...

So then Damian would be the next Robin? Or maybe Stephanie.
Young justice looked good I need to watch it.
SpeedyBolt: it's been on hiatus since June
LadyCanary: Really? I gonna miss that because of work :S
It's great. I recommend it.
Oh, that makes sense
I have to get back into it. I never knew there was a hiatus.
THANK GOD I'M A MINDLESS KID WHO DOESNT HAVE A-
RAWRity: So that means either Stephanie or Damian will be the new Robin XDDD
o.o;
LadyCanary: by that point we'd be onto Dick being Batman and Tim being Red Robin
what game is this??
But I had to choose between it and Avengers. avengers win every time.
Yummmmmmmm RAWRity 8D
Kurra: Myst 4
LadyCanary: unless this is after Batman went back in time to avoid being killed.

Some random bitch came to my house and started walking around with one of my twins
ASoftFluffyThing: you poor sum bithc

I never liked Cinnamon Toast Crunch. :D
i find this creature adorable for some reason..
i miss oreo cereal D:
I haven't had Trix in FOREVER.
^^^
OREO CEREAL.
Fluttercry: i miss those old "This person can _____ but can they see what makes kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch"? ads
I miss the old Cookie Crisp ads. :(

Dammit, now I want Lucky Charms.

/me has a N64 :3
/me also has one
same
13and now for the man made of cheese, achenar~
God, I'm gonna get some Lucky Charms, Trix, and Cap'n Crunch. And keep them all in my room for meeeeeeeeeeee
/me just needs to find it D:
I like cheese
still, I remember when they came out with Cap'n Crunch that was nothing but Crunch Berries. I almost died as a kid.
Movie night is Friday!
Shizuka: The Ripper game. Ya got it?
I actually stopped eating Trix when they were redesigned.
RAWRity: ME TOO.
mint berry crunch!
13no i don't
They redesigned Trix?
IT WAS AMAZING.
What?
ASoftFluffyThing: Yep.
Darn. haha it's horrible and we need more suffering.
13feeling like nopony is watching anymore..
AJIsAwesome|Busy: What did they do?
im watching
Shizuka: I watchin..
ASoftFluffyThing: They were originally fruit shapes and now they're ball shaped with swirls.
I am I'm a Fan of Myst.
I'm watching, Shizuka
Me too.
Just working on other things as well. :D
We just have no clue what's going on so can't talk about it.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: they....swirly balls....BLAAAAAAASHPHEMEEEEEEEEH
Yep.
It killed Trix for me.
Shizuka: I'm watching - been sometime since I caught one of your Myst series playthroughs
I also loved Tony's Cinnamon Crunchers.
I hope they still have the original in the stores. I haven't had Trix since I was a kid.
http://i.imgur.com/QRfDk.jpg
AJIsAwesome|Busy: They were balls to begin with, then they became the fruit shapes, then they went back to balls...though I kind of liked the fruit shapes better when they switched to them
so you guys, you better hope I win B movie this week, because next week I have a new B Movie and it's much, much worse.
Meanwhile: i told you to delete that picture of me =_=
J_E_Smith71: I know. It's just that I prefer the fruit shapes/
Meanwhile: O.O
Meanwhile: Dat Uncanny Valley
*.
05,15RAWRity oh god...what is it
That feel of finding incredible treasure but nowhere to spend it
Dammit Meanwhile, put that away. We're talking about cereal
Fluttercry: The Love Guru
:D
I should suggest Borat one day but....nah, not gonna do that.
RAWRity: is the point of b movies to pick a movie so bad it cant even be watched
ASoftFluffyThing: NO. :D
superretroworld: no, but that's always my goal.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I know, right?
Looks like someone took in a little too much caatus juice
RAWRity, angering the crowds with his B movies.
RAWRity: then i wonder who picked epic movie :D
05,15My B movie is Fist of Fury AKA The Chinese Connection
RAWRity: So I guess you were the one that picked Epic Movie, right? :D
people who purposefully pick terrible movies often don't have the balls to show up for their own films. Not me.
well this is damn creepy
Someything.
hehe, dethklok in equestria
If Nudist Colony of the Dead gets picked, you best expect me to be here for the whole damn thing.
RAWRity, putting all his marbles in one shot, or all his eggs in one frying pan, or something like that.... @_@
My B movie is...god I forgot the name of it already....
Felidae's been my B since I joined (Well orignally it was my A but it was downgraded to B in July on the spreadsheet)
When I win the B movie, I'm just going to ask the Bronystate admins to stream two hours of C-Span.
Kurra, why?
BBBFF
05,15not a movie. not elligible
Would Kung Pow be considered a B movie?
I'd like to come across such a creature in Myst
Because THEN, I'll forever have the dubious honor of picking worst movie that will ever be in the history of the universe.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yep
Okay.
and he DID
AJIsAwesome|Busy: That was my original B choice before Felidae got knocked back to B
J_E_Smith71, I'm somewhat concerned that a lot of people might be bored by my B-Movie choice. yours would be even more boring.
although...I did meet Shroomie :)
voting is closed now, right?
I put it as a B movie.
Okay.
I think my B movie choice was Piranha
The original one
05,15twilight_sprinkle I haven't closed it yet. so if you're going to vote make it quick
Kandarihu: You've actually seen it?
My B this week is Maximum Overdrive
Is a mayonnaise a B movie?
Bird taunts you with food.
Fluttercry: ok thanks, although i dont even know if im eligible to win twice in a row, am i?
*shrugs shoulders*
The adorable creature is back
J_E_Smith71, as in two hours of C-Span or my own choice of B-Movie?
twilight_sprinkle: only for the thing you won last is all
what game is this
o ok otakon
it's Myst IIRC
one sec then
05,15You can win anything but the category you already won
Mist IV
ok ill vote quickly then
spitfirecolt: Myst 4
God a fourth one?
one sec
nice
Come to think of it, I guess my movie choice probably isn't really all that boring anyway.
also WHAT is squeaking?
So you can win all four categories? :D
I do NOT trust the squeaking!
Fluttercry, do you have the link where we can vote?
AJIsAwesome|Busy: yeah if you are REALLY lucky
but yeah, I've actually got a NUMBER of movies lined up: Nudist Colony of the Dead, The Love Guru, Master of Disguise, The Asylum's Sherlock Holmes, The Incredible Bulk...
When do we plunder Achenar's plunder?
That's aweomse. :D
/me squaeks in otakon 's ear
otakon: it was that bird dinosaur thing
Hopefully: Nothing To Lose, is a B movie
AJIsAwesome|Busy: actually only 3 times, you only vote one pony ep
As an alternative to this, I also have a troll-choice for B-Movie that's not exactly a movie.
05,15ASoftFluffyThing are you on the mailing list?
Oh, yeah.
Fluttercry, yes I am.
Kandarihu: Well you said my "choice would be more boring" so I was seeing if you actually saw Felidae before
05,15Kandarihu if it's not a movie it can't be picked
i dare someone to choose in the name of the king :D
I picked Chicken Run for my A :3 I love that movie
ok i voted
Aardman FTW
Never seen it/
chicken run <3
ASoftFluffyThing, /)
ASoftFluffyThing: Same here.
/me Pokes the chat for no reason

Meh, fine. If that's the case, I might as well 'fess up about what it is. It's a 2 hour long Youtube video showing how to assemble a gaming computer.

dat poke :3
what did I choose for A this week....
AdamTheDuck, AJIsAwesome|Busy (\
Fluttercry Interstella 5555 counts ?
Though if i do need a A list movie to pick. How to train your dragon looked good and I never seen it.
i chose nothing for a movie
Owww Ponies47. My side :<<
but yeah, my A movie for this week is Battle Royale
05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yes
Adventures of Milo & Otis
Fluttercry as A or B ?
I would play that http://fav.me/d4u9itp
Cypresswolf: That sounds familar..........
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: YES YESSSSSSSS
05,15not sure. I don't know much about budget or critical reception
my A movie is dazed and confused
I remember what my B movie is now
Fluttercry: it's a anime featuring a number of daft punk songs.
HOLY SHIT!
05,15I know that
EPIC MUSIC!
CrimsonPhoenix, that game must be made
Well the reason I've been voting Felidae the whole time is that it's obscure and is unknown to people in the US (outside YouTube) and I want to see the chat response to it
Was the second Ace Ventura movie
Well that was sudden...
OH SHIT!
It's more B list then A list though it has a cult following.
KILL IT WITH FIRE!
:O Gremlin
What was that thing? It looked like a taller version of some elf creature thing.
/me puts a tonberry on otakon s face
Fluttercry budget $4 million Rating: 7.7/10 still only 68 minutes long
Cult hits make for the best B Movies. Well, those and foreign blockbusters
do you guys mined if I show you the new picture I did in Paint? (I used a mouse so it probably won''t be good)
Follow the lemur?
-____-
*mind
05,15I'd say B
weeping_pegasi82: Sure.
PM it.
i wonder if clerks is an A or B movie
This reminds me of another game....something about a black panther....
Good will vote for that next week
superretroworld: Clerks was shown recently
So you have to wait six months to vote for it
looks neat weeping_pegasi82 :)
weeping_pegasi82: Very nice.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so will i if I'm here :D
Not bad weeping_pegasi82
J_E_Smith71: ik, but i forget if it was a or b
I want to rub their ears <3
I think it was B because it replaced that Samurai thing
weeping_pegasi82: have a look at the comments
oh
I'm going to get a proper art program and tablet in december
If Felidae ever wins, my next B choice will probably be The Wizard
13and now you know why the puzzles are stupid hard
So some random person just walked into your house?
J_E_Smith71: you talking about the one where that kid goes to a video game competition in California?
Oh gosh...Felidae...not a bad movie, up to a certain point - distrubing though
Ponies47, your comments
05,15Voting is closed in 3 minutes! All tickets in!
It's basically a 60 minute Nintendo commercial. :D
Because they ran out of funds halfway through and had to increase the gameplay length?
FlutterMEDIC: Yep
Fluttercry what are we voting for?
but I like it
*liked
05,15Panda|Drawing lottery
So lotto now close the night before the movies ?
Panda|Drawing: for movie night
twilight_sprinkle >.> I never do those because usually im not around for

05,15Yeah. It's so we can go through the responses and mark ineligible picks so intermission doesn't last forever
Panda|Drawing: aw
13blaaaaaaaah i hate this age so much
RAWRity: ..............
Sounds Good
I'd like to see The Plague Dogs make a movie night - just for the reactions
Shizu rage
http://derpy.me/FrrJE You know guys
05,15Also, every single one of you should prepurchase X-com so we can all get Civ V for free
RAWRity, I have no words for that. It it were for the ears, that's one thing.
This part is as far as I got
13it gets way worse cypress
otakon: man id love it if birdemic won :P
I would seriously be in love if someone could code a crossover of Kirby with MLP
Cypresswolf: That's the same reason I'm picking Felidae...for the chat response
I rage quit here too
Birdemic for B movie. :D
Ponies47, have a look at my photos
stuttering craig: 'kirby... you deserve some sex'

FlutterMEDIC, see ya
Success
Bye, FlutterMEDIC :)
13finally...
13the worst part is the guide is useless
See ya FlutterMEDIC
131.5 turns doesn't help, it's timing
05,15hey guys. It's 21:45 in the EST right?
I thought it said 1.5 *seconds*, not *turns*?
Birdemic would be amazing.
0,14yep, Fluttercry

Buytoast: myst
Code monkeys was messed up :d
13dear esther isn't a game
13it's a poorly paced movie
ah, so it's the heavy rain for pcs?
13twilight progresses faster than dear esther
Shizu must play Anna sometime
Shizuka: that looks like Crimrose from CosmicBreak :/
13must play what now
maybe twilight is even a better love story then?:O
so i'm guessing this is Myst: Gilligan's Wrath?
Buytoast: Myst 4.
Buytoast: you mean heavy rain is myst for console? meh
permission to post steam page Shizu
13post
http://store.steampowered.com/app/217690/

EEWWWW I SAY SOMETHING NASTY OM TVVV DDD:

13meh horror
the HORRORRRRRRR D:
heavy rain isn't nearly as adventure oriented it seems
you know what progresses slow? time. takes for fucking ever for it to go by.
oh, so it's a jurrassic park mod
You have to PAY for anna now?
ikr RAWRity a minute seems like an hour
RAWRity: unless your enjoying yourself
time is slow only if you have nothing to do
Depends on what you're doing, IMO.
i WISH i had more time in the day
that's kinda creepy
time gets slower in math class >___>
time keeps on slipping
slipping
0,14into the future?
just a little bit
or if youre doing something boring. but try preparing for an exam, time flies by in an instant and youre like "oh crap, i thought i had more time!"
weeping_pegasi82: yay
yes
I CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE!
into the furute
Panda you're not required but supporting the developer is always nice

ime kepps on slippin slippin slippin into the future...
TheGreatAndPowerfulT not what I meant. I thought that was a F2P indie game.
Unless i've got my info mixed up.
i feel like i'm watching the entirety of the legend of zelda spirit tracks
only with barrels instead of a pan flute
don't think so probably there is a version without DMT around
DMR
who's streaming again?
What is DMR, trixie?
Shizu
is
thx
No problem.
oh my god who's play myst!!!!!
Shizu is.
Panda ups DRM*

Shizu, I love you
weeping_pegasi82: You have a tablet?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I still dont know what that is.
/me retreats back into the shadows
nope used too then it broke :(
Panda Google is your friend can't link it right now
saturday is my time to ditch you grandma :)
weeping_pegasi82: Y u no buy another one?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, you mean Digital Rights Management?
yep
Why couldnt you just say that...
I'm under the age of 18 and I never got into drawing on the computer until now
weeping_pegasi82 never too late to start drawing.
weeping_pegasi82: You could have your parents buy one for you....:S
Who is streaming?
Shizu is.
because for me that's quite normal. specialy when Nittany is around
So what had to be manipulated with the creatures?
Btw MOVIE NIGHT TOMMOROW!!!!!
13so that whole annoying thing was me moving the mangrees around by calling their names
13it's a very stupidly specific sequence...
I think I missed the title of this game, what is it?
Panda: :O
Shizuka: still cool.
Myst IV iirc
13you have to push them around til the predator ticks off the plant in the pit, then move them around again so he falls in
oh
:|
Myst.
OH I FORGOT TOMRROW IS MOVIE NIGHT what are we watching?

They were pretty blunt. :D
13i used to have the alphabet memorized
13now it is full of useless pony trivia
13BRONYSTATE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME
the alphabet is overrated anyway
^ :D
:D
But without the alphabet you can't spell Bronystate
Or ponies
ASoftFluffyThing: i can in binary
I tried being an artist as a kid. Didn't go wll. :D
Shizuka: or you could just look it up on a game guide for no penalty :/
I might consider drawing again, but I have to make sure I have time.
twilight_sprinkle: I never understood binary much
That and the right programs.
Shizuka: Memorize the pony alphabet.
Crystaline_Shard, on a game like this? looking up a guide is insulting
i improved as i raged at my class mate for calling me by my wrong call out name :)
CrimsonPhoenix: isin't that exactly what hes doing now?

xD Shizuka
13and he says "no linking book home" you dirty pony
05,15It barely survived Tennant and Patrick Stewart sharing the same stage
I don't think any one's paying attention to my links...
"Fuck oh"

Fluttercry: That game was the boopinest. :(
yup I'm here
I don't know Fluttercry he seem to try to hard in Kirby
Because noone has talked for a while :/
05,15I don't think it's on purpose, or else he'd be as bad in other games.
Did they ever find the Paint ability in Kirby Superstar?
was mostly curious to see who was still awake
AJIsAwesome|Busy, no they haven't
Dang it.

Years. one does not just Complete Myst.
Well, I guess it would take [needs Bronystate Gold to see answer]

You know, the only reason that map is impressive is because he is a NOT a professor of art, or art student
an emulator that you can use on your computer to play N64 games
twilight_sprinkle: I tryed Chrome. The chat looked terrible
chrome becomes practically unusable after a while
NewSuperBronyU Moo ^-^

Hello MissRain YAY another weather themed pony :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Disney PMV: The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Who is streaming?
I saw a skylanders shirt at the mall a while ago. I kinda wanted to buy it
time to play the Super Mario Sunshine :3
SB
NewSuperBronyU \:3/
Crystaline_Shard you mean me? I've been around here for a long time.
Ahh, I wanted to brawl with him
I didn't even fit me, so what's the point :p
lol
I'm new. Greetings.
what was on the shirt?
:)
hi Crystaline_Shard :)
/me waves at Crystaline_Shard
I think it was just a bunch of different characters
Crystaline_Shard: Make sure to read the rules. :)
/me gives Crystaline_Shard a welcome bucket
Chi Crystaline_Shard
hmmm
hiya NewSuperBronyU
hi*
fightin Derpy_Hooves at that
lol
lol Oppan
derpy has some skills
oh ok
15 lives?
/me grabs some popcorn
this kinda makes me wanna play lol
/me wishes he still had brawl...
I dance around Like a idiot and troll them because I am very VERY good at dodging.
dat lalala
/me just hit stuff
*cant remember last time i played this*
oh yeah, because the frame data of dodging is SO unpredictable :p
I wish i had brawl too... Ive only played the Wii like....3 times, for maybe 20 minutes each time :D
what can you even do against a giant octopus?
You underestimate how good I am at avoiding :D
ll it does is collect dust on my shelf
*All
LOL
mario needs more games with VA like Super mario sunshine :)
does anybody hear play halo or gears online?
I had this game... I was pretty good as Lucario
RaveBrony: I'll take it from you
I still can't believe Zero Punctuation reviewed Guild Wars 2 with an oddly positive outlook
weeping_pegasi82: HOLEE SHEETO I'm not the only one!
HoodyNinja: NAh, family is hellbent on keeping it for some reason :D
weeping_pegasi82: i play gears with some friends in private games but not a lot online
what is this?
SB playing Super Smash
Night
BRAWL FUN FACT: using Jigglypuff's final smash in the crevice area just as its closing up will result in a cancelation of the FS animation, thus causing a permanent giant Jiggly Puff
I miss my gears copies
never had online access on the wii the game would have been a lot more fun if I had
Nighties
cya rdx
:3
toast
Last Nintendo console I had was ... well, Nintendo
my brother was an expert as Snake so I got my but kicked everytime I faced him >: (
lol.
I remember those tanks
i has that game in my ds still
Advance wars
BRAWL FUN FACT: These two need to use alot more back-air... seriously
BRAWL FUN FACT: if you have yoshi eat said giant jigglypuff you get a giant egg
That means I missed out on all the Mario games, Zelda games, and Metroid games
Advance Wars was amazeing
lol nice SB
Dang, you guys better watch yourfooting with Final Smashes
What if SB is really playing his alter ego?
Brawl fun fact: You CAN one-hit smaller characters if you fully charge a normal attack with Ike
You mean Brawl Obvious fact :D
BRAWL FUN FACT: Game and Watches judge move (B) is NOT randomnized. The humber is determined by which frame the move is initiated
*number
Derpy's getting nervious.
and larger characters from 20%
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Mad TV's Eeyore and Twilight Sparkle Skit
DAT POST :S
Crystaline_Shard not really my laptop is starting to crash
what would have been a cool feature was that in the pictochat arena you could connect your ds to it and just cause trouble for the players
Oh wello Derpy_Hooves :D
What would've been cool was that they made LAN compatible with Melee.
I would've played that for years if it had LAN.
Idk, something about playing fighting games with everyone in the same room just can't be replaced by LAN
HoodyNinja: If done FRAME PERFECTLY, you can "choose" your desired number in that move. You can see this in some Brawl TASs
lulz gold hamma
fucking computer...
. . .
0,14...okay
0,14that taunt?
0,14fucking gdlk
brb
This is really dragging on
that taunt? now i want SB to win
0,14I just have GG quotes
BRAWL FUN FACT: After re spawning and initially moving off the re spawn platform, you have exactly 60 frames, or one second, of invincibility
I thought there were 100 frames in a second...:S
hells yeah
60fps in this game
13you know sb
Oh, okay.
13whatever happened to late night mario party
some should be jigglypuff and fly

If only Mario Party had Wi-fi.
Pit is the only true flier
-_-
Shizuka: well superbrony64 is the only mod that plays nintendo mostly when streamed so youll have to ask him

:(
11,02I could do it again :D
CALLED IT
NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU: PLEASE DO IT.
wait
PLEASE.
BRAWL FUN FACT: Game and Watche's worst 1v1 match up under BBR Unity ruleset is against Ice Climbers; he has a 35:65 disadvantage
bomb
If My wii still had internet I would join in and suck :D
also, yo Derpy_Hooves, when do you want that rematch?
NewSuperBronyU my laptop crashed :I
/me whole Mario party plans involves spamming inconvienaces for others.
thats punishment for quoting gangnam
0,14>describing matchups

0,14Guilty Gear?
0,14>.>
Paper mario: ttyd <3
11,02Derpy_Hooves: Moo :3
consarnit, you didnt punish him for referencing gangnam!
13now i know why sb and derpy always play the same character
NewSuperBronyU i wasn't joking
Derpy_Hooves: Good job yopur prize is a mare hug
twilight_sprinkle: He should be comended for such an act, not punished
13so when the round ends it technically says both of them win
11,02:P
/me hugs Derpy_Hooves
Derpy_Hooves usually plays Toon Link i think.
^
brb
HoodyNinja: commendation in the form of being treated to roasted meat, where he is the meat
I would like to see them chose at random
11,02One more match then we'll play Mario Party O3O
Shizuka: they dont always play the same char tho
I have gone random on Derpy_Hooves. 4 stocked :3
11,02Too bad there isn't an online Mario Party game :/
twilight_sprinkle: Don't use your fancy math-a-matics to muddy up the issue
NewSuperBronyU: That's what I said. :O
15-20 turn online Mario Party.
Yay! I get out of school tommorow for sugery!
0,14Big Blue is best stage
13pick a level other than that same zelda one
Cya everypony
Provided no one rage quits.
?
11,02I was thinking of also starting an entire playthrough of Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door...anypony interested?
Bye, DerpyMuffins :)
13i think i played that once
NewSuperBronyU: YES
13forget how far i got
NewSuperBronyU: ALL MY YES
NewSuperBronyU: DO EEET!
NewSuperBronyU: YES ! ALL THE YES. also do the musical stage
I never got past the black dragon
I HATED him so much
13i think the last thing i did was the wrestling
I got a poison mushroom roulette on the final boss. :D
BRAWL FUN FACT: Delfino Square is actually among the 5 neutral stages in unity ruleset, despite its steady scenary changes
peach is best brawl character
^
Well, Metaknight
HoodyNinja: Meta Knight is. :P
but I play Peach
MACHO
GRUBBA
He's proven to be the "best" character in brawl.
because of that FUCKING MOVEMENT
I prefer Mario or Marth anyday.
13mmm 11pm chili
AJIsAwesome|Busy: THen explain why I always beat him, or anyone that uses him
AJIsAwesome|Busy: really? well thats lame if theres such imbalance
AJIsAwesome|Busy: to the point where hes actually banned from Unity tourneys
Im jealous, Shizuka :3
0,14there's imbalance in any fighting game
13rain rain <3
yep
0,14the trick is that how bad it is
13did you miss mein stream? :<
<3
I think so, Shizuka
Brawl has EXTREME Inbalance
I was asleep all day :<
13:<
To be honest, I never understood why he's the "best" character. I still kick his butt. :D
^
I vote for calm :(
SaxyPretender: well there shouldnt be such a huge imbalance that one char is better than the rest
0,14stuff like tiers doesn't matter until super high level play
0,14pfffft
METAL NIGHT IS BEST HE HAS A MASK AND A MISTERIOUS PAST
his moves are hard to avoid. and geto ut of he racks up damage fast and his finisher can catch you off guard.
Buytoast: Meta*
I use Mario on Melee and I still beat people. :D
0,14you're always going to have your best character
AJIsAwesome|Busy: i can pm you with so much explination if you wish. i doubt the mane chat would care for all that info
PFFFT no one uses mario
HoodyNinja: :(
0,14whether it's Eddie in GGAC, Bang in BBCS1, Wesker in UMvC3
Also hes is one of the few charactors with a counter move.
0,14you're always going to have that situation
Melee > Brawl
SaxyPretender: *your. a personal best character is fine, but not when its proven that someone is the best character in absolute values
I actually used to beat my brothers so much with Mario. :D
that is a defined fact
^
0,14it still happens
0,14matchup data and what not
NewSuperBronyU where are you?
matchup is annoying, but =/= imbalance
NewSuperBronyU: Moo?
13i blame tacos
OH you beat your brothers with mario!!! well Mango got out of brackets at APEX 2011 using Mario
No
I blame sxyprtndr
Melee > Brawl
shit i could go for some tacos
and I can proove why
AJIsAwesome|Busy: international tournament
PROOF!
Oh.
anybody else eat 40 volcano tacos in a row because they were hungry?
anybody?
1340?
13no..
It's a tie for me, only because of the smash feature in brawl
what's the best character on smash bros melee ???
...
I ate 14 in a row
tekken 5:dark resurrection didnt seem to have much imbalance, a lot of characters were pretty equal
I regreted it later
I tried, but had to stop at 39
/me 13does not handle spice well
*: dark
man, them volcano tacos are good
I've eaten 4 in a row but no more.
i haven't had em since those 40 though
taco bell still makes em right?
yes
I dig spicy food but I can barely handle several volcano tacos in close succesion, even theoretically
/me is tired of playing PIU
Soul caliber massive imbalances :D
^^^
never had any Volcano tacos
I'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
0,14which Soul Calibur, Crystaline_Shard
Order a dorito taco and ask for the volcano sause
0,14later TheGreatAndPowerfulT
ewww
doritoes
derp
nasty shit those are
Bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Two comes to mind Also four so I heard.
eh
Soul Calliber imbalance? Pffffft.
Yoda
I like them
Night TheG- gone
0,14Two's pretty well regarded in balance
I one hit kill with link
:/
0,14Link was the worst character
He was?
Buytoast: The fuck u say bout mah doritoes?
fu link is awesome.
13help me ponies, whose hair do i want more http://i.imgur.com/bZkx0.jpg or http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg
i said they're nasty
im bad with peach
0,14yeah, for some reason, he was considered to be the worst character
Shizuka: Second.
http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg <- That one
Shizuka: first
I beat the whole game with him easy.
Shizuka, first one :3
Survey says number 2
Rain says one so one it is
and im back o.o
0,14Shizuka, why not both?
Funny thing is hes the only one I could do it with :/
yellow
One is more real
Shizuka: go with http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg
On hard anyway.
SaxyPretender: That requires cloning. :P
or extreame or w/e it's called
0,14Soul Calibur's an iffy thing because technically EVERYONE has a one hit kill due to ring outs
I used Link and only Link in 2
Shizuka: go with the 2nd one
Ring outs make it fun
Saxy. Link has the most :D
0,14yeah, Link was great for ring outs
also the easyist to pull off.
SaxyPretender: beware Astraroth
0,14and for getting through Weapon Master mode
http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg i like this one
astra being my second best I mastered his combo that takes off half a health bar.
:D
my main was Seigfreid
Night
but dammit could NEVER beat a Kilik player
god I hated Seigfreid
what?
goddamn cheap staff
/me has never played any Soul Caliber games. :d

GANGNAM STYLE !
13what is she doing to that mushroom
Shizuka: Why does she have a toad in her dress?
inb4 active imaginations take over :D
13that's... a better question...
lol mushrooming stamping...
13why does my backspace key keep getting off center....
HoodyNinja: shes preggers obviosuly she pulls them out of the womb at whim.
HoodyNinja: Um....I'll explain later.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: five thus far and one off shoot hack and slash
13need to replace my keyboard but that's $90 i don't have..
Shizuka: just get a cheapie
Crystaline_Shard: And then shoves them back in? :S
0,14Soul Calibur V was gdlk
13nuuuuuuu
btw, I kind of feel like explaining this anyway: Meta Knight is the best character in Brawl under unity ruleset essentially due to his excessive frame-safe options, such as planking, speed, and ridiculous gimping ability
CK|Ded: WIll you at least tell me why you're dewad
Yes AJIsAwesome|Busy
Shizuka: but a cheapie is better than one that doesn't work right?
13if i wanted cheap i would just steal the keyboard from kimiko upstairs
13but i do not want cheap, i want good
ooooooooh
burn
Shizuka: you like naming your PC's don't you?
HoodyNinja: ....nope, 'cuz I'm going to bed.
13plus that doesn't have my macro keys..

Shizuka: cheap and bad are NOT synonymous you know

because WWW is too mainstream

otakon: My play strategy is based around fight for your life
on youtube
www.AJIsAwesome:(.com
HoodyNinja: -__________- that is a lousy strategy considering the more you are downed the faster FFYL is over with.
0,14oi, knock it off

Okay
aww but its fun
otakon: not with relics
My PC Is Sooo Sloooow Its Barely Running The Chat + Stream... But Its So Laggy On My Screen :(
http://scootaloo.com/
also, you're not supposed to die ALL the time, it's more about the eventuality of it
:3
HoodyNinja: yes even with Relics, the duration gets shorter and shorter until you just die
scootaloo really work xD
otakon: Thats just it, though, I don't die enough for that to happen
And I dont even use the relics for it
WHo Wants To Be My Friend? :)
HoodyNinja: dude I had to revive you like ever 2 minutes last time we played
I wanna play Myst I. The original prerendered version.
otakon: Because you kill what i'm looking at...
Laurayne: I will. :)
Laurayne: Will you be here for BMN? :)
Laurayne I Want ! :)
Whats BMN?
Brony Movie Night.
aaaaaaah
Not Sure.
Im Not Exageating When I Say My PC Is Sloooooow
Wow I Failed Spelling That... Hard
Every Friday/Saturday we air two movies and pony episodes based on fan picked suggestions from the lottery that we have.
BMN , never see that like this, for me it's the FRIDAY NIGHT !!!
/me might not make it to BMN
:(
today it's batman (2008) and something else i never saw
Ill Try To Show Up But As Far As The Movie Is Concerned, I Hate Watching Good Things In Low Quality... It Ruins The Experiance For Me :(
BRB shower
On normal days we have random streams.
I won't forget chitty as he was a badass. Also that movie was long and great but I didn't know the name of it
AJIsAwesome|Busy should we tell Laurayne about "The Rule
thelonepony: Not yet.
otakon: Okay, let me rephrase that, my play style is about getting close to the enemy, with the eventuality of FFYL, but i don't plan on going down all the time, it just happens sometimes, the point is, it's how I play, and you don't need to help me
no
Actually, This Is My First Visit To This Site After Seeing It Mentioned In That Youtube My Little Pony Documentery... I Actually Just Came Straight To This Room
Wait till Laurayne knows this place. Then we'll tell.
kay :)
Laurayne: It's how most people end up here
wait what rule :p
Im Confused...
Laurayne: Well, welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules! :)
6_9
Okay
HoodyNinja: how is THAT a viable strategy? the Siren doesn't have ANY skills that enhance FFYL mode or work better when you're near death as far as I know.
oops i have to go to school, else there will be so much traffic jams ... OK BYYYYYE everypony, love y'all , c u in 18 hours ;)

hopefully not so sick tommorrow
otakon: NO! I get close to the enemy, but being incapped doesn't bother me
You All Seem Very Friendly. Im Glad, I Usually Get Booted Out Of Chatrooms Or No One Talks To Me And I Just Leave... Its Pretty Hard For Me To Keep Up Since I Cant Read Too Fast With My Bad Eyes, Then I End Up Typeing Really Long Things.... Like This... :'(
It just tends to happen
otakon HoodyNinja Am I the only one who thought that Mark Meltzer's story was way more interesting than Delta's?
WHO the HELL is Mark Meltzer? I don't recall him
HoodyNinja: yeah try KEEPING your distance
Laurayne: Use this website to help you: http://ponychat.net/faq/
HoodyNinja: seriously it works wonders for survivability
Even I do it as a Gunzerker
What Is It?
What is what?
The Link...
otakon: Also my main is now Zer0
WAS IST DAS
I'm mostly here just to past the time and this site has had an influence on me.....for the most part a good influence.
Laurayne: It basically helps you with certain commands like /me and other stuff like that.
HoodyNinja: well getting close is NOT a good idea unless you're going Bloodlust
^
HoodyNinja: the sniping tree is pretty doable however
[Alpha-Trinity]: Agreed.
^
good influence yah indeed. Well 'cept sometimes when scary movies come on but.
cx
otakon: I'm experimenting and trying to decide between Bloodlust and Cunning, but survivablity is still pretty good
/me hides for those, goes eat cookies

Now I like to draw. I draw on paper, phone and tablet. I prefer pencil though I'm getting better at shading and sketching
HoodyNinja: :I
HoodyNinja Mark Meltzer was a character who had a lot of audio files and appeared as a Big Daddy. His story was that he lived on the surface until a Big Sister came on land and took his daughter. Obsessed with finding her, he lost his marriage and almost his mind lookig for clues and slowly discovering Rapture before eventually going down there to find his daughter. Unfortunately, Sofia Lamb caught him and had
Testing.
Nvm
Yeah I loved him
/me feels stupid
HoodyNinja I kinda wish the game was about him. And that you didn't have to do those stupid protection missions to rescue the Little Sisters.
I love how the chat has nothing to do with the stream
Be right back. Have to check on my bike.
I still want to play Bioshock infinite
Its just like background music at a casino
13it makes me worried nopony is watching..
I'm paying attention.
Just working at the same time. :D
i'm watching Shizuka

/me hasn't finished the game yet
It was supposed to come out this year....

Aww man, I was really excited for Infinite to come out before the world ended. :p

I have no idea what is going on
All I know is I love it
i got Fanny Evil leafy bomby dora lollipop and pie
Details, details
13and then he gets really evil
what game is this?
(=_=)
i just got here
Myst 4
/me sits on AwesomeSauce
thnks
its 4hz
lol
otakon: WB how was the shit?
the frequency, that is
HoodyNinja: non existant, took a wiz
/me sits on HoodyNinja
13so basically this takes a bit of knowledge of the universe
/me makes a sit-stack
13the link in chamber is constructed of a material known as nara
otakon: Did you hit the bowl?
That's howa joke and frog are a like, if you disect it, it dies
13which is an ultra dense form of rock that puts diamond's hardness to shame
HoodyNinja: no dammit
13sirrus has figured out that the crystals store energy and release it as a vibration when grounded
I know dat feel bro
NO
13so given the proper frequency, he can de-stabilize nara on a molecular level
I DON'T WANT TO THINK
13and thus escape
YES
HoodyNinja: NO I meant stop asking me sttuff like that
You WANT TO THINK
:D
Hello?
OH ok
My bad :s
Oh nvm
/me sits on AJIsAwesome|Busy
Shizuka wouldnt you think instead that it would just, you know, go boom? like whAT HAPPENS when you destablize molecules?
HoodyNinja: :I
13it's like he says
I mean i get its a game
13it shatters like glass
lands on HoodyNinja
I Just Finished Reading The Chat FAQ.. Thanks AJ For The Link
No problem. :)
13if you could vibrate at such a specific frequency, you could probably destabilize molecules in reality
^
13it's just probably stupidly hard to find, sirrus is just lucky
13observe
i dont think that works for most materials, though
/me Observes...
shizuka that isn't posible because molecules have a rabbit ears ' random " motion when enegergized
/me sits patiently and waits
still waiting
/me watches in awe
its not really that hard, im pretty sure they have instruments for creating verying sound effect with much precision
looks in aww
all because of the nature of quanta
/me grabs some popcorn
This Is All Way Over My Head...
HoodyNinja: Pass the popcorn.
13so that's the rock frequency, but we need something with more power
13so
so.......
with bated breath
Dester it sometimes works with glass, but yeah, usually its not possible
SO LA TI DO?
/me aims his popcorn cannon at AJIsAwesome|Busy
:O
*ducks and covers*
13derp it's contained
otakon is unimpressed
/me See Popcorn Cannon
did I miss it?
yay~ :(
I missed it didn't I?
....
twilight_sprinkle well if you vibrate molecules its called heat, you would need rapid heating/cooling to crack glass
/me gives AJIsAwesome|Busy some popcorn because the canon malfunctioned
Oh. Thanks, HoodyNinja :D
Well, this Twilight Sparkle theatre is looking a little... different.
13here we go

/me fires his popcorn cannon at Laurayne
I was talking about the page itself, AJIsAwesome|Busy
to many smart people in here
HoodyNinja: But you said it malfuntioned. :(
/me Is Burried In Popcorn 6_9
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I LIED!
I'm guessing this is something to do with the Myst series.
:O
well thats hitting a resonance frequency, not energising molecules
Dester i thought thats what they meant in the game
*eats fired popcorn*
13ready for a ride?
Don't fall off
Yes
And just in time too; I just got in a couple of minutes ago :3
eating hot cheetos with tapitio is taking a toll on my stomach :S

You can make band names by looking at an ordinary classroom
that rales are fun?
Im Back
screaming and hollering

13we learned that achenar started repenting when he found the wildlife in his age was starting to like him
Shizuka: that it's always harder than it looks
that Vivi is our lord and master?
sound is powerfull?
13we learned that sirrus is evil and concocted a plan to bust out of spire
13BUT!
13why take yeesha
I Learned.... That Iced Tea Goes Right Threw Me...
I knew it; this is the Myst series.
13also yes
I Learned That I Don't Have The Fingers For This
/me Looks at clock
i learned that ice tea is on law and oprder

13this is revelation
Dester: pi pika pi pika pikachu pika

Have a great time at Canterlot Gardens!
Exile doesn't work with your capture card? Dang :S
Pip Piplup!
13not a capture card
13scrcap
13but more importantly it forces 640x480 resolution
there are pokemon in the chat o.o
13can't run windowed
Damn, I have to go to sleeps, later
Laurayne don't feel bad, I'm a 3rd year physics student

So there's no way to have it play on one monitor and have the other one be where scrcap is?
I thought i was only half pokemon
13can't alt-tab
Please take the RP somewhere else, please.
13that and games that force screen one to change screw up screen two
Ash: get back in your poke ball
/me Sits And Eats Poke'Snacks...
whatever
Just saying.
Well, that's just dandy :|
:3
Gah and the chat derped out on me. Did any one ping me before like about 30 sec ago?
Well we still have Myst to explore.
Ponies47: Nope.
Not that I can remember.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Must of been another chat
If there's one thing Monty Python taught me...
Ponies47: I think it was HoodyNinja.
Always look on the bright side of life
Ponies47: He asked where do you get all that bread.
^^
egawd, a human
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I made it myself with wubs :3
:O
Ponies47: I made gold when I tried wubs. :(
/me Wonders What Her Cutie Mark Would Look Like...
Random, thought, If Cadence is a princess and celestia is a princess (niece of celestia) and luna is a princess, who is this incestous Queen?
Incestuous Queen? :S
niece is a princess, hence must be a daughter, and celestia is a princess
I never thought of it that way. :S
weird right?
That's...........interesting?
Dester Has A Point...
I guess it still needs to be explained later on.
If they do, of course.
In a kids show?
Faust is the queen
Kind of like AJ at the family reunion.
She has family all over Equestria.
for all we know, Celestia might have other sisters. I don't know.
You kidding, Dester? I mean, she'd be conquering countries left and right if that were the case
we never hear of another county
Trottingham?
she took down discord and took power that was not hers rightly
Im Wondering... Why Are There So Many Princesses... No King Or Queen... And No Princess... You Would THink After 1000 Or So Years She Would Find Someone....
Princes?
Laurarne rigicide i guess
Laurayne*
How Do You Make Prince A Plural And Have It Not look Like Princess?
The main reason she's a princess is that Lauren thought that the Queen title would seems too harsh, so she named her Princess Celestia instead.
I'll most likely be on a for a few hours before I hit the road
Laurayne: Princes?
Princessess is the proper pluralization
tomorrow :3
Princesses*
i believe
:P
yeh, one too many s's

well never mind, it's all laggy
Spy?
/me Look sRound For A Spy
I mean, fictional works in particular
13SPY SAPPIN MAH... WHATEVER THAT IS
but yeh, the mother of celestia must have been erm, CLOSE with family or cadence would simply be her sister, and as we know, she's a niece. okay, i got that off my chest, i feel better now
Maybe Shes Princess Of A Different Area...?
I'll see y'all in an hour, I need to go shower
I Didnt Get That Far In The Series Yet... :'(
of a country we never see and is lives in canterlot?
I doubt that any of the sisters are incestuous. I'm guessing that Celestia has sisters but hasen't told them about them. I don't know.
*other sisters
Luna?
We just have to wait.
not saying the sister's are incestous, i mean the mother was, or something, anyway its just weird
weird
Other than Luna, AJIsAwesome|Busy?
by
13nice hair
Polydunami: Maybe. I HAVE NO IDEA. Just putting out a theory.
I Wonder What Their Names Would Be... Celestia.. Luna.. Uhmm... Solstice...?
The hell is on her face?
She looks a little like Billie Piper :3
live action?
Well anyway I'm out of here for the night

Myst 4
I Could Never Get Into The Myst Games...
I've never even played a Myst game :S
Which Is Strange... Because It Seems Like A Game Im Usually In To...
I've seen them played...
Lately Though, Ive Been Really Into The Command And Conquer Games... Thoough Im Not Very Good... Ive Never Won An Online Match...
Maybe One Day If I Figure out How, Ill Stream A Match On Here... If That Would Be Okay...
/me uses Ubercharge on chat
Bah. I have nothing to say at all :S
Thats Team Fortress 2 Term, Yes? From Medic?
Yes. :$
/me doesn't play Team Fortress 2 :3
Ive Played It Alittle... Though Im Not Any Good At That Game Either...
I'm trying to get it, but I have to clear up a TON of space.
Plus with updates, it's going to take a LOT of time.
Figured just getting a terabyte hard drive, transferring all my data there, downloading TF2, and then just switching it back.
I Love This Background Music...
Wait, I meant terabyte USB port.
well night everypony
Night, LunasGuard :)
Goodnight
Good night, LunasGuard
That way I can keep TF2 on a USB port and my old data on my harddrive.
Either that or just upgrading my harddrive.
How much memory do you need to PLAY TF2? :S
13HEAVY IS SPY
Polydunami: Over 10 GB.
Oh. That all?
I have 60GB space.
I have 1/10 of GB memory left.
My Father's Computer Has A 600GB HDD
Laurayne: Lucky.
We once had a 2GB computer.
And 6GB RAM
I think I'm better off just getting a terabyte harddrive.
Anyone know how much terabyte hard drives go for these days?
Hello everyone.
My laptop currently holds about 283 GB.
Not That Expensive
Hey, Ninjazz!
Hello Ninjazz
Hi, Ninjazz :)
AJIsAwesome|Busy, not much, half a terabyte was $50 for me
AdamTheDuck: WHAT?! :O
And I have about 233 GB of free space
HALF FOR 50$?!
AJIsAwesome|Busy, eeyup, or might have been a bit more, I can't remember :$
Nowdays, A Terabyte USB HDD Is About $60 I Think
Looks like I have some shopping to do. :D
I Might Be Wrong THough
Thanks, guys. :$
seems like there was water one time in there
Laurayne: I've seen 5TB's go for almost $100.
I remember the days when 4 gig usb's were the biggest you could get :$
5TBs.... Youd Almost Never Need Another HDD...
my laptop holds 451 GB of space... I'm currently using 257 GB of it and I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S TAKING UP SO MUCH SPACE
SHEESH, that's alot.
I really need to upgrade.
Do you have iTunes, weeping_pegasi82?
yah
oh...
Doesn't Itunes take up a LOT of space?
13DAMMIT ATRUS
13YOU HAD ONE JOB

I'm wondering if itunes is worth it... my brother's classic rock is the only thing on it...
Haha :D
I actually never saw SB rage until last night. :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy, SB RAGED?!?
Noooooo I missed it
It was the almost final level of Rayman Origins.
Must have been after I left, AJIsAwesome|Busy. Damn
/me Looks at the clock agian and facehoofs hard
SB rages are smart.
Ponies47: GO TO BED. :D
Not just ragy.
Like... complainy rage.
Ninjazz: True.
Ive Never Seem Itelectual Rage Before...
Very true.
Ponies47, http://derpy.me/giQ3X
Wow, intellectual rage?
Laurayne: It's actually quite interesting.
One of my favorite kinds of rages.
Ill Bet
anybody know of a free music player?
AJIsAwesome|Busy, aww was that raging? I thought he just seemed fustrated
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah think? Also crazy Twilgiht FTW <3
*Twilight
"No sleep" is for the weak
VLC Player Is Really Good
AdamTheDuck: More frustrated than anything.
BUt I have to agree with him: that level WAS CHEAP.
Hence SB rage.
INCREDIBLY CHEAP.
Since it's the closest thing to it.
Yeah I guess that is rage...
Ok I go to bread for real now
Good night
Night.
But I still haven't seen SB go *flip table* rage yet...
MAKE SURE YOU GO TO BED.
Goodnight
Goodnight Ponies47
AdamTheDuck: I'm not sure if he ever will.
Good night, Ponies47 :)
Can't see him doing that.
He doesn't seem like the type of guy to raise his voice or such
That's why I like him XD
^
13calling it now, i get a water guide
13i've never had the others
Never?
Hm.
HOLY CARP! Shizuka is still streaming???
13eeeeeeryp
Watcha playin' Shizu?
is this Myst3?
4, actually
The Jayhawks, Rob Zombie, Van Halen, U2, The Rolling Stones, The White Stripes.... I think my brother was obsessed with classic rock...
Panda: SB streamed and she took over after.
ah
AJIsAwesome|Busy oh.
I'll most likely be on a little bit before I head out :3
Ponies47: :I
Ponies47: SLEEP.
NOW.
weeping_pegasi82, buy some Nicki Minaj to fuck with him :D
/me Jumps into his bed and goes the (squee) to sleep
THANK YOU. :D
/me sneaks int Ponies47s bed
c:
13anyway
DuskStarshimmer|sad|: :I
13yeah saw it coming that i would get water again
13i'm pretty sure it picks based on how fast you get to this part
AdamTheDuck: he left, I got his laptop. He won't be getting it back >: )
What other type of guides can you get?
13air and fire
/me Huggles DuskStarshimmer as he falls asleep
13fire i believe you only get if you beeline straight here
nite Ponies47
WOw.
/me noms on Ponies47 while he sleeps ._.
.me snuggles Ponies47 while he sleeps :3
13water you get if you take your time getting to this point
o.o
:3
13air is somewhere in the middle i think
Ok.
13the general idea being water flows around problems and is patient, fire burns straight through
Makes sense.
13far as i know anyway, i just know i've even TRIED to get the other two guides, water every single time
Hmm, that's interesting ^
SEE?
That sucks.
That Looks Like Twilights Magic Book.... To Me Anyway...
AJIsAwesome|Busy: what are busy with? it's been on your username forever
*you
Homework. :P
13see like that's an air guide
math?
Nope.
then what exactly
Stupid ad's in the way. :I
weeping_pegasi82: Music.
This game's graphics are very nice.
This Music Is Very Good...
^
100%
hmm I may know some about that I have been playing cello for 5 years...
Indeed Laurayne
I Love Good BGM
13and there was a fire guide
I'm considering taking up acoustic guitar.
You would think that Shizuka gets fire, seeing she is a Pyro incarnation.
13but i'm not looking for them, i'm looking for the waters
Ah.
play the cello its fun :$
Maybe.
I Play Drums... Im Told Im Pretty Good At It...
I've played the violin for a couple of years, but had to drop it because of school getting in the way.
my class is playing Danse Macabre and Fiddler on the Roof...
13dammit...
I Have A Cool Dark Red Rockwood Drum Set In My Room...
let's form a Brony band :$
Can I be on guitar?
are you any good?
:P
Only if I get to play the Mayonaise/Horseradish.
Playing for 3 years
going on 4
nice spongebob reference
Playing the piano for over 10+ years.
Is muffin an instrument? :3
I consider myself an intermediate player, though. :D
Im A Novice....
i vam so jelouse of piano players and sax players, talk about amazing sound
Dester: ALWAYS wanted to play the saxophone.
and eveyone play the guitar, its kind of cliche now
AJIsAwesome|Busy: do you have your own piano or do you have a keyboard?
weeping_pegasi82: Both. I play keyboard more.
My actual piano is out of tune. :D
Has Anyone Ever Seen The Full Live Performce Of The Epic Sax Guy Thing...?
So I settled on a keyboard.
Laurayne: I haven;t.
*haven't
at least you don't have to tune it :D
Its Really Quite Good.
luarayne yeh, its for some forign got talent show
unlike the cello
he doesn't actually play it
Its a fake
he just kinda... dances
Dat Allegr0
I Dont Agree... Some People Are Really That Good
Allegr0: :O

Allegr0: Aren't you supposed to be asleep? :D
It's teh mighty Allegr0
sleep, what is "sleep"/

I always loved victorian style english. :$
Please Dont Quote Me On This... Im Not Sure Myself, This Is Just My Opinion...

Agreed :$
Is this Myst 2?

And this is where I become afraid of Shizuka's logic skills /)_(\
This Puzzle Looks Fun...
13this is actually one of the easiest once you know what to put where
13just wait
13the next one is astonishingly stupid hard
I Like A Good Logic Puzzle
I stink at Layton, I feel dumb
Shizuka this one is just color coating, no? I mean Yellow + Blue = Green. right?
WAIT WHAT!
mitamaking: You know there's an entire episode of Dragonshy dubbed by Professor Layton?
Shizuka what was the combination for that? O_o that didnt make sense.
Or someone who sounds like him.
Got to go
13you get a RGB and CYM set from dream
Well, that happened
13you get a color combo from spire
Ah!
Ok, I get it now!
Ok, I think ill play this game now. Once I get money of course.

Shizu is best detective.

Thank You For Streaming Shizuka... I Enjoyed Spectating This Game
I might buy Myst one day... I only stay for snippets for long gameplays like these :$
Seems like a very interesting game.
AdamTheDuck: ah yes, that fic. evidently not crying after reading MLD 4 times over makes you a soulless monster on the internet.
that was cool
oh no, a man has to lose an imaginary horse to the creatures it shares an imaginary world with
I'm out now. See you all at BMN

MadSurge: If you can find something that can make me cry, I will die happy. you dont know how depressing it is to not be able to cry anymore:(
Laurayne: I know that feeling
I Think It Would Be Cool That While Live Streaming Isnt Happening, Video Links Would Play in That Area Instead When We Posted Them.... I Mean... I Think It Would Be Better Then Nothing, Yes...?
Hehe AJIsAwesome|Busy, you find the most curious OST's :$
AdamTheDuck: Yeah. :$

For some reason.

AJIsAwesome|Busy: do you find me an unlikable person?

DoctoDoctorWho, I've never spoken with you, but I dont find you to be a bad pony XD
DoctoDoctorWho: What? I Like you. :S
Panda|Sleepies: micthemicrophone
You seem like a nice guy. :)
OneTrickPony yeah... what about him?

Apparently some people are tyring to petition him at Canterlot Gardens. :S
Something about a song of some sort. :S
AJIsAwesome|Busy, there is hate because people took that one song he did for KOLT litterally -___- even mic and YAC both came forward and said they are friends. It's YAC's gf thats an issue though XD
OKay.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: like yesterday, bus was at 100% capacity, 3 to every seat, except for mine, which was empty save me. and I never said a word against pple sitting there
Panda|Sleepies: THanks for clearing that up.
Panda|Sleepies: I was wondering why there were people hating him.
not that I was complaining
DoctoDoctorWho: I would've sat next to you. :S
Had to reboot :|
You seriously seem like a nice guy.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, well thats the only reason. Also people dont like his genre i guess....
Okay.
/me glomps DoctoDoctorWho, "you are awesome..."
^
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho
alright
thanks, you and the bronies are the best
im really off to bed now
night
13so apparently
13there's an ARG in black mesa
/me hugs everypony
Night Panda|Sleepies ;)
THERE IS?
13http://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Code_C see that video on the side, that's me! :D
13i didn't even know it was getting so big <3
Theres A Pirate In Black Mesa...?
Shizuka: almost 2000 veiws
Shizuka O_O holy poop you are famous!
131500
13i think it is only because i was the first to video it
I was rounding up
13a redditor beat me to the discovery by a few hours 6_9
:O
oh redditors
they so silly
Im wearing a suit today!
Shizuka, wait a second... how the hell did you get that image out of a sound file?
13http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zysx7/the_black_mesa_source_arg/c690t7t
13SSTV
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Mz0t3MjBA
Shizuka forgive me, but I'm not very smart with that. What is it?
13SSTV is a format for converting a picture into sound
the mares at my school dont stand a chance;)
13specifically the bleeps in the video
Shizuka... so... I can convert an image into sound and vice versa?
13back when we were building up for Portal 2's announcement, Portal was updated to have a bunch of radios, some played morse, others played random beeps
13ARG players worked out they were SSTV transmissions, decoded into pictures that spun off into all kinds of weird ways
If you converted them into a imgae you got spoilers
hm....
13any case, once you've heard SSTV, it's really obvious when you hear one
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I get to wear a suit to school today
So how do I get a hold of this program Shizuka?
DoctoDoctorWho: Cool!
13so bumming around the BMS files i came across the odd man out qecode.mp3 (everything else is wav), and lo and behold it was SSTV
AJIsAwesome|Busy: so you live in georgia?
Nope.
yay now back to studying mandarin
Shizuka... what program is it? i wanna tweak around with it :)
Back to my music report. :D
Shizuka: Because Valve is fucking clever like that.
13not valve this time though :3
AJIsAwesome|Busy: It seems I am mistakin, which state r u from then?
Texas.
13valve hasn't learned how to manage ARGs either
AJIsAwesome|Busy: have fun :)
13the ARG around the pyro update was supposed to take weeks
AJIsAwesome|Busy: austin?
13it was solved in hours
If not the ones who did it they had a hand in it. after all it is their game.
I'll probably move up north after I graduate.
13not valve's game, the BMS team did everything from scratch
DoctoDoctorWho: Arlington.
cool
Valve made portal :/
13well yes
13as cute as the portal 2 arg was getting all the indies involved, the payoff was crap
Crystaline_Shard: Valve made everything that exists now and everything that will exist
OneTrickPony: has it right.
XD
They are currently fighting google over the souls lost playing Runescape.
my dad plays Runescape ><
WHAT!
DeathStar
WHAT!
lol runescape
My dog plays Runescape
I played thaat when I was 5
Shizuka, can I show you a video?
Panda|Sleepies: he dose... he stoped for a bit but he got back into it recently now he has a laptop
13k
ugh, now I have to go in 30 mins early for mandarin
oh right finding the radios and getting them to emit the code was a challange in it's self useually in some out of the way spot in the level it's a challange for a steam badge.
You know what really grinds my gears? Dentists.
13yup
13any case
13sleep time
Shizuka >.> nvm
Night, Shizuschlafen :)

So once again Valve mind fucks players who go a step farther :/
Any one queued up next?
Night.

DoctoDoctorWho : What If It Was A Relationship With A Special Pony?

11,02OneTrickPony '/join #nameofchannel'
k thnx
aww I failed
DeathStar: get into the military* first
Anyone knowthe track name of the music that plays before you get a star in SUper Mario Galaxy? It's calm and peaceful.
"Indeed, the very process of construction and creation foreshadow destruction and decay. The palace of today is tomorrow's ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation stone of everlasting regret."
DeathStar: :P
*/"I am become death, destroyer of worlds."/*
tSparx: not nessesary that actualy adds more steps. politics is the way to go
see this master, they are all fools. they know not the true path and like sheep to a sheperd, we shall unite them

DeathStar: who ever said anything about them knowing who set them up against eachother? they cannot fight a foe they do not know exists
/me tucks NewSuperBronyU|Zzz and gives him a Big Mac plushie
11,02O.O
/me noms on the Big Mac plushie :3
:D
/me wants sleep, but must study
CANNOT
/me wants sleep so much, but has a music report to finish
DECIDE
Shake shake shake, shake shake shake...
DAMMIT :|
DoctoDoctorWho: I never said they would know, but you clearly need to learn more about psycology. when given a common enamy humans will work together even if temorarily to take down the common threat
AJIsAwesome|Busy: is it due tommorow
o.o..
OneTrickPony: Yes. :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy: yay for procrastination!
/me dances on MadSurge s head
OneTrickPony: /)
AJIsAwesome|Busy: (\
DeathStar: What makes you say that? We don't exactly have an data on most effective ways to take over the world
Have some relaxing music. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AManXblFRY0
tSparx: maybe you don't
DeathStar: don't worry about my hair, they're like Pinkie's and are always a mess :D
/me Yawns
MadSurge in a good way or bad way?
MadSurge: pinkies hair is not a mess it's just curly there's a difference
DeathStar: Ooh ooh, please, tell me, who takes over the world in the future? Is it the Japanese!? I want it to be the Japanese!
LightTrooper105: good way! :D
Science...
tSparx: I'm not a psycic!
For science~
I already knew that.
DeathStar: I understand that already, my plan revolves around setting them on eachother and simply cleaning up when they are weak
I took AP Biology. :O
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: no, NOT BIOLOGY!
*:P
11,02Just remember...
DeathStar: mine are curly too, but they look like a mess too :D
DeathStar: Well then where did you amass this data on taking over the world if you're not a psychic or a time-traveler?
11,02Bonds don't store energy ^_^
tSparx: lots of free time ^^;
bonds transfer energy
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: I understood all of that
http://derpy.me/z1Onr
DeathStar: No one's ever taken over the world before, how could you know the best ways to go about it?
Science Woona :3
DoctoDoctorWho: that could work, but how are you planing to deal with resistance after?
mfw science http://mlfw.info/f/8055/
lol
tSparx: well you can look at how far people have gone, wich systems are easyest to exploit a touch of human psycology works too
I Was Good At Science In School...
I am meh at science
I am good at physics and chemistry though
DeathStar: once my forces own the planet, it merely becomes a war of atrition, I beat down resistance where it rises and no matter what you say or belive they will eventually stop and see that life isnt all that bad under me
What does the expression "dog and pony show" mean anyway?
i use to love science..
I Have A Question...
if only http://mlfw.info/f/7775/
what has science done
DoctoDoctorWho: but what exactly are you planing to do with the world once you've taken over, that seems unclear
DoctoDoctorWho: ah that saves the problem of hairs and succsesors
Mickey Mouse Is A Mouse, Yes? And Donald Duck Is A Duck, And Goofy is A Dog...?
Laurayne: yep
Then How Come Pluto Is The Only One Who Is Actually A Dog...? Is He The "Special" One?
Pluto is just dumb and doesn't realize he could talk and wear clothes :D
Laurayne... Cartoon
Logic in a cartoon? you must be new here.
Im Sorry, I Thought It Was A Funny Joke...
funny thing is Mickey Mouse is half naked..
DeathStar: Not that I think there's anything wrong with speculation -- I'm a theologian after all, lol.
oh god there goes my childhood..
Donald Duck Doesnt Wear Pants....
tSparx: of corse it's only speculation, but it's only that untill one puts it into practise
The ponies don't usually wear clothes
don't ruin my dam childhood...
I dont wear pants :3
Donald duck moonlight's as a flasher.
Donald Duck was banned in Finland because he doesn't wear pants.
REALLY? :D
Yep "D
dam o.o
*:D
Alright, into Hw mode
/me Curls Up With My Picture Of Rainbow Dash <3
Dashie..
MLD...
/me stills needs to read a fanfic
*still
Celestia is not a monster, dammit
I've never read one.
no bad LightTrooper105 don't make me think of that! :'(
DeathStar I can't help it Dx
MadSurge: Not really a monster, but just enforcing the law she upholds.
Nightmare Moon, Discord and Chrysalis are evil!
LightTrooper105: no I can't help dancing, you can controll what you type
Molestia Trollestia.
:/
As attached as they are, RD can;t stay with him forever.
I Think Rainbow Dash And Applejack Make A Good Pair...
DeathStar I type with my mouth moving Dx
I don't ship.
Laurayne: of friends
But if you do, more power to you.
/me drops a boat on AJ three times.
LightTrooper105: ....odd... I type with my fingers moving
DeathStar: Sure, If Thats How You Want To See It...
lol
It's not my style.
Name the game referance and get a prize.
Im terribly sorry, Omega level chat derp
Laurayne: yes that is ^_^
what happened?
DeathStar sorry I ment was when I talk my I type what im saying... even If I don't want it too
Nothing much.
DoctoDoctorWho: well part of what happend was you didn't answer my question ^^;
DeathStar: what were you saying? I underwent omega derp
LightTrooper105: that's.... interesting....
If I were to ship anything, which I don't, but, y'know, from an outside perspective looking in, Rainbow and Pinkie seem like a reasonable ship (well, most ships are reasonable but)
DoctoDoctorWho: I was asking you what exactly you where going to do with the world once you've taken over. you're not very specific about that
tSparx|Hw: hmmm, I don't see it personaly. but alright
http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w247/magnus1114/552120-20applejack20dream20fluttershy20human20madmax20rainbow_dash20rarity20twilight_sparkle.jpg
DeathStar: first off, there is the fact that admittedly I am a bit of a greedy bastard so...
the world looks pretty good from here
DoctoDoctorWho: what do you mean?
DeathStar: I can understand shipping Rainbow with any of the mane6, honestly
Laurayne: oh god, I just watched inception yesterday D:
o-o...
second off, I plan on leading mankind into a new age of prosperity, the next step is space. I've already figured out the terraformation of mars:)
tSparx|Hw: I don't see many of them being lasting relation ships though. maybe rainbow and apple jack could work long term and rainbow and fluttershy MIGHT work at a streach rainbow and rarity, but i don't see the others working out
and about my first point, Im also doing it for the money
poo
That should be *pomf* Laurayne :D
Theres a good fanfict out there with the mane 6 not shipped together but because of a magic mirror Flutterdash Rarijack and Pinkietwi get kids so the whole story revolves around protecting the kids untill they figure out what to do with them and stuffs because the mirror belongs to a old god. and stuffs.
Hehe
You know who is the buttest? I'm the buttest.
DoctoDoctorWho: how are you planing on taking man kind into a new age of prosperity, and what's the point in you having money? if you rule the world you can have whatever you like for free
OneTrickPony: *whistles*
OneTrickPony very disney..
^
^^
I wonder which mods are actually watching chat
why?
DeathStar: thats something a dictator would do, Im a nice guy and Ill buy what I want
legally
they are DeadpoolDash they always are
lemme check
they arent all always watching
Im sure some of them are watching
DeadpoolDash: That's what they want you to think. You probably also believe that they are humans and not AI's. They want you to think that too.
DoctoDoctorWho: of you don't have an air or are not going to step down and have people vote for leader you are a dictator. that is the term for is. the difference is weather you are a benevolent dictator or not
I've seen pictures and AIs would never make themselves look like that
Damn all the fanficts I watch updated on the same night XD
imma go to sleep now see ya guys later
<3 http://static.zerochan.net/My.Little.Pony%3A.Friendship.Is.Magic.full.1162562.jpg <3
/me goes to read
Laurayne: bad link
THE SWEETIE CHRONICLES FRAGMENTS UPDATED!
DeadpoolDash: that's what they want you to think
DeadpoolDash: They want you to think that too, see? See how this game works? They have you fooled completely.
o.o...
/me spazez out
/me calms Crystaline_Shard down
night OneTrickPony :)
la la la la
OneTrickPony night
Its Not Bad...
Goodnight
Nightm OneTrickPony :)
DeathStar: the term dictator is defined by how one rules, not ones time in office. a dictator has no limits and absolute power, I do have limits to my power and I listen to what the people
want
oh gawd pupplysmiles so much D'awwww
DeathStar: Yeah what he is is a constitutional monarch without a legislative body.
DoctoDoctorWho: what actualy brings up a question. what kind of govern ment will you be running
tSparx|Hw: ah you're right?
*minus the ?
DeathStar: Well, I guess you can't be a *constitutional* monarch without *some* sort of legislative body, but obviously in his government the power balance is basically the opposite of, say, modern UK
Great Britain*
tSparx|Hw: understood
the funny thing is that it combines the best traits of the 3 most conflicting ideals, dictatorship, democracy, and communism
DoctoDoctorWho: Communism or socialism?
Stop HORSEING around guys :D
DoctoDoctorWho: actually they're not all that conflicting,
oh gawd a stable Sweetie is screwed :/
..... It Wasnt Bad Right...? I Didnt Send A Bad Picture....
:(
well, I have the strength of a dictatoral ruler, the fairness and benevolence of a democracy, and the authority to controll business like a communist
DoctoDoctorWho: Do you own the means of production and command the entirety of the economy?
pretty neat http://youtu.be/4Oku3aG839A
I'd also argue that benevolence isn't really a part of democracy, just a common (but hardly inevitable) product of it
o.o
Laurayne: I didn't notice it, but I'm sure whatever it was was fine -- otherwise someone would've let you know and/or yelled at ya :P
tSparx|Hw: no, business owned by the people, but if things get out of hand I CAN step in and say no.
DoctoDoctorWho: Then you're a socialist nation, not a communist one.
DoctoDoctorWho: Wait wait, by "the people" or by individual people?
hello every pony
hey dude
hey Moopy sup
hows it going?
tSparx|Hw: never really put much thought into it, how does socialism work? and I mean like pple r free to start and own businesses of their own.
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah then you're a socialist nation.
Hey therainbowvortex!
DoctoDoctorWho: I like how you associate fairness and denevolence with democracy when all of the government styles mentiond can be fair as long as they are run correctly
mornin therainbowvortex
good i owe a mate 40$
Hi, therainbowvortex :)
hello Moopy
hey lighttrooper
AJIsAwesome|Busy: hey can i ask you a qestion
DeathStar: I guess, It makes WAAAAY more sense when you are looking at it, I have it all written out
DoctoDoctorWho: it probably dose
therainbowvortex: Sure.
DoctoDoctorWho: I think that the easiest way to put it is to define in a communist (Leninist) nation, the people band together to form a Communist Party which overthrows the old government and takes its place, theoretically (though in practice this has never occured) paving the way for a Marxist / socialist society.
i gessing by you name aj your favouite pony right
therainbowvortex: Yes.
i was just wondering y
tSparx|Hw: Ill put more reaserch toward it
Hey is there a stream up?
DoctoDoctorWho: In communism, the Party owns the means of production and dictates the goods to be produced, usually through 5 or 10 year plans.
Nope
No stream
Ah. Thank you.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: ya know what I like best about aj?
No problem.
DoctoDoctorWho: What?
no offense i like her just not as much as say pinkie or dasie
THat's okay.
Oh. AJ talk?
AJIsAwesome|Busy: that little thing she does with her hooves, ya know when she crosses them? I find it cute as hell
Not a lot of people like AJ.
DoctoDoctorWho: Definitely. :$
Well, no really hates her either.
DoctoDoctorWho: In socialism, there is theoretically no government, and the people own the means of production. Though admittedly socialism was defined by Marx more in terms of what it wasn't (compared to capitalism) than in terms of what it was.
So Therainbowvortex did you get another fluttershy toy yet or what?
She's just not really an attention grabber like the other 5.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: its just for me she sasent done a lot to stand out pinkies random dashie oh yer what u said
It's pretty easy why the other 5 ponies get so much love.
therainbowvortex: I know.
therainbowvortex: I agree.
It's just that AJ stuck out od the group for me ever since episode one.
Well, I personally don't hate or love her. She's just... unremarkable.
<3 http://mlpchan.net/pony/src/1346641466671.jpg <3
AJIsAwesome|Busy: im just waiting a good epeisod to rely make her stand out awsomly
If you don't mind me asking, why do you call her best pony?
tSparx|Hw: the government DOES produce its own goods as a kind of "default competitor", But doesnt use its authority as an unfair advantage.
Ninjazz: I can see that. I really can.
Ninjazz: Hm? I never said that.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: people tend not to like aj as much but those who love aj REALLY love AJ,
Ninjazz: I just find her my favorite.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, that's my way of saying "your favorite". :^_^;
I dont have a favorite pony
hi Ninjazz
Ohai DeathStar.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Word: T-Sparx and Pinkie Pie are my favourite ponies, that doesn't mean I think they're the "best" -- what a nebulous term anyway, haha
Are we talking about how Applejack is underrated as a character or something?
DeathStar: I don't REALLY love aj. I just find her a REALLY good friend I could've needed in my life.
Lol. Almost pinged DeadpoolDash. Like the old days.
Ping.
And now you did :3
Ikr. :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy: thats a good point i like aj now
About Applejack, she certainly stood out from her intro from my point of view.
pinged where?
Well, AJ to me seems more like the fanon's favorite mold.
NO WHERE!
Moopy: what do ya think
LOOK AWAY!
Hello Ninjazz! :$
Ohai MadSurge. :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Oh, hey, thanks, I'd never thought about that; that's why Pinkie Pie is my favourite. I've always wished I'd been friends with Twilight, but she's my co-favourite because she is /exactly like me/.
think about what?
THe main reason why I find AJ to be my favorite is that she's the most OPENLY caring and supportive out of all the mane six. Sure she can seem bland at most times, but the fact that she is so supportive of her friends puts her at the top.
/me Sonic Rainboom!
:P
I do however, have a soft spot for vinyl scratch
I'm on to your trixy tricks
I've always wondered what the specific reason I love Pinkie is so much -- beyond just her awesome personality, I mean :3
Since AJ doesn't have a specific character and personality other than being hard working and honest, she seems like the easiest to write as a main protagonist.
Ninjazz: that's true she can be interperated in many different ways because she is a very plain charicter (not saying that's a negitive)
tSparx|Hw: the fact that she can bend physics?
DeathStar, exactly!
I can see that as well.
Ninjazz~ http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/504ab51f2e274021cf708740e172d00e.png
Down to earth?
Ninjazz: though she can be interperated as having bad intentions as well
Polydunami: That too.
DoctoDoctorWho: No no, AJIsAwesome|Busy just made me realize: it's because I wish I could've been friends with Pinkie, I wish I could be friends with her right now
for me pinkie / fluttershy /dashie is my fave mane 6 derpy fave backround luna favoite princes swetie bell my fave cmc
Polydunami, far more than most.
SHe's also the most down to eath pony in terms of the mane 6.
/me Cuddles Her Rainbow Dash Picture
MadSurge, IT'S LOADING SLOWLY BUT I'M ALREADY LOVING IT SO MUCH.
:D
OOOOHHHH MAAAIII GOOOOOOD I LOVE THIS.
Took a few seconds for me to recognise the boy as Spike, MadSurge :D
^
My life would've been SO MUCH EASIER if I had AJ as a friend IRL.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: true, even twilight can be very unreasonable
found the original without the corner insert http://youtu.be/Twl5UB4ye44
/me kicks ass in a classy manner with his nice suit
Really? :D I recognizied him immediately :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy, I'm sure most of ours if we have /any/ of the mane as friends.
It's because of the hair, right?
Even if it was our least favorite.
Ninjazz: Agreed.
Mostly, yeah. Also, non-purple skin.
Ninjazz: also, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/026348c24687c01c4b203f6bd151fffa.png
If I could live in equestria I would drop all my plans
I Love Dashie...~<3
AJIsAwesome|Busy: i had this dreem where i was sad and pinkie huged me now I WANT A PINKIE HUG
She looks a little more G1 in that
DeathStar: SHE JUST GETS FLUSTERED/ANXIOUS/OVERWHELMED/ETC
MadSurge, SO MUCH LOVE.
Even though I was always partial to Rarity, I think Twilight Sparkle would be my favourite of the mane six.
:)
brb, require food
It wasn't the character development for AJ that sold me. It was her personality that made her my favorite. I don't really judge characters based on their development. Doesn't sound fair to me.
Ninjazz: for your daily fix of Rarity :3
Ninjazz: I've often said before, Rarity's my least favourite, but I'd still love to be bff's
I guess Rarity would be tied with Twilight Sparkle...
IMO
Thinking hard on it, I absolutely LOVE Rarity. As many of you know. But if an IRL situation, I'd probably have Pinkie Pie as my best friend.
y cant i see streem wait is there a streem
dang it i missed NewSuperBronyU|Zzz again
DoctoDoctorWho: another question, how are you going to keep track of what's going on in all the different counties when you're leader? and how will you deal with the growing population and shrinking resorses?
Pinkie Pie is best pony
DeadpoolDash: secconded
DeadpoolDash, False, Spike is best pony.
Rainbow Dash is the best pony
If I were in Equestria, Twilight would be my bestest best friend in the whole wide world :)
I Wonder If Rainbow Dash Would Take Me Flying With Her.......
tSparx|Hw, as I said, even if they're least favorite, they'd be nice friends to have.
Everyone knows Crackle is best pony. :P
DeadpoolDash: i agree kinda im a so confused :'(
Crackle's cousin, you mean?
Moopy: technicaly she's a pegisus not a pony ^^;
Semantics :|
well she said shes the iron pony
AJIsAwesome|Busy: so aj yr fave pony what about backround pony
AdamTheDuck: He happens not to be a pony
DeathStar: All three tribes are ponies
Derpy Is Cutest
She also cheated.
Pinkie Pie is the cutest. :p
Moopy: yes but that dosen't meen she's a pony made of iron
DeathStar: Earth Ponies are ponies, Pegasi are ponies, Unicorns are ponies.
therainbowvortex: Don't have one. They're all to great.
Pffft whatever dude i think shes still the best pony so there you go
*too
MadSurge, where ON earth did you find the anime Rarity one?! It's absolutely gorgeous!
think I might either play ME3 multiplayer or GW2
DeathStar: that flustered me for a while too, I plan on splitting the world up into country sized blocks called "provinces", then districts, and so forth
Ninjazz: whoo dashie did not cheat
Ninjazz: search in Bronibooru :3
therainbowvortex, okay, played unfair.
tSparx|Hw: you see that's the only think I disagre with, they may be closely related, especialy to allow cross breading like with the cake twins, but pegasi would need raddicaly different bone structure to be able to fly and I'm sure unicorns would too to be able to chanel magic
Or the judges were just plain idiots. -_-
Ninjazz: now that i agree to
but yer it was unfair
what's all this?
what is what?
therainbowvortex, I mean hanging AJ above the mud pit and they allow it?!
you people talking about how rainbow horse blatantly cheated and then cheated again when she agreed to play fairly?
what what in the what?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9opnsHQppc
Buytoast, she didn't agree to play fairly, just agreed to play. :p
that's horrific
So they would be anthropomorphised?
I wish.
alright, defend the cheating rainbow horse
DeathStar: Also they are clearly capable of interbreeding, which makes them the same species by definition, whether their bone structure differs between tribes or not.
I'm not defending her.
I condemn her.
not like she purposefully broke rules to ensure victory or anything
I'm fine with them staying ponies, IMO.
Egad, I thought Fleur was naked for a second there :S
-_(\ me
tSparx|Hw: just because they identify themselfes as ponys dosen't meen scientificaly they are the same, and I acually can't remember what happend in the cristmas special >.> I need to rewatch that one
:3
DeathStar: authority is split up amongst different governers and ministers and so forth, who all eventually answer to me
I like they way you said that Polydunami. :3c
tSparx|Hw: donkeys and zebras can interbread and so can lions and tigers, they are not the same speices
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt3mo4pVvAw&feature=related ^_^
Oh, Youtube. Why you give me suggestive... er, suggestions? :|
Laurayne, dem K-On
DoctoDoctorWho: that may cause trouble if a minister was to become corupt
hey every pony i have school holdays right now
therainbowvortex: Nice.
thats cool
Ninjazz: Bronibooru has so many great pictures and no smut/creepy comments! Only weird/creepy pics :D
Crimsonphoenix: Dunno
I mean, they're pretty much human. And this is My Little Pony.
Ponies.
MadSurge, that almost takes out half the fun. :D
AJIsAwesome|Busy: it also meens i have been come on to brony state for a hole school trume
Laurayne, Personally I must say that video felt pretty lazy
DeathStar: thats okay, the Officio Assasinorum will "silence" him and he will be replaced soon enough.
tSparx|Hw: hmm i was working under a different understanding of speceis
Ninjazz: but the comments are there for the creepy stuff :D and they're glorious
Maybe, But Its Still Good Im My Opinion...
Mmmmh I wonder what I should get this morning
MadSurge, huzzah!
DoctoDoctorWho: I would question further but it's sleep time for me, lets continue this at a later date
oh I know
Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7761a93b0b0edb87e303f155c79c9506.png so smug
NIght, DeathStar :)
hey i have a party to get to so i gota go
good night every pony ^_^
I should get some FUCKING CRACKLING OAT BRAN http://youtu.be/pwud6Qh4e_c
therainbowvortex: have fun! :$
DeathStar: indeed, may the lunar princess protect you
Bye DeathStar!
Goodnight
Polydunami: Agreed.
Vale DeathStar :)
Polydunami: It's the pony concept that garners attention.
Nacht DeadpoolDash.
DeathStar.
LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
Heh I love Sweetie Chronicles fragments
Is It Weird That Im A Girl And Have A Huge Sickeningly Massive Crush On Rainbow Dash...?
Im actually not for the NLR anyway, I just like luna
Well, that's true, DeathStar
Good story glad hes updating it again.
night
Laurayne, Rainbow Dash is a tomboy
Laurayne: not at all...
it's a bit normal
Laurayne: Like a Girl-Crush?
anyway Hi agai neverypony taking a short break from reading.
Laurayne: no but that would cause people to question your sexuality
But what I find peculiar is that it's My Little Pony... and the characters are HUMANS.
Hi, CrimsonPhoenix :)
Wait
I meant Crystaline_Shard
As They Should DeathStar
Okay, that oat bran commercial got way too annoying for my tastes :S
Laurayne: Well, I for one don't think that being bisexual or a lesbian (etc.) is weird, for one thing, and then secondly I don't think it's weird for a straight woman to have her exceptions or whatever.
MadSurge, I don't get it but I love her expression!
/me dances off to bed
Ninjazz: neither do I to be honest
Good night, DeathStar
Night deathstar
nighty everypony
Good night, taoumi
night taoumi :0
:)
Nacht taoumi.
Vale, Taumi, bonam noctem.
Ninjazz: http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/index?tags=rarity Go wild :D
For the Solar Empire!
DoctoDoctorWho: LUAR REPUBLIC
/me waves the United Equestrian banner.
Lunar*
DoctoDoctorWho: Great And Bountiful Human Empire* (cough cough)
Crystaline_Shard: HERETIC!
MadSurge. :O
I will save this page. :I
can has shirt please http://www.welovefine.com/3518-troll-harder.html
Ninjazz: and make a little altar around it :D
Oh, Celestia
Why are you so awesome
Im fine with a double rule, Im just saiyan that if war broke out between the 2, I'd side with the celestia
For the Protectorate of Equestria!
hay everypony i was wondering if the new comic book comes with the varient covers or is that seperate
MadSurge, oh come on. I already got like 500 pictures on my computer alone. I don't to make an alter for it. :D
Ninjazz: :D
I'm wondering what this "comic book" deal is in the first place.
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm cool with all these Luna fans, and I can't wait for her to regain her status as co-ruler (if/whenever it happens), but war is more likely to break out between the three tribes than for Princess Luna to gain a sizeable following in the mane 6's lifetime, and the three tribes going to war is almost impossible to think about.
Laurayne: That's okay. You're among friends. :)
Laurayne: You're on a brony website. "Love and tolerance," remember? If anyone mind, I will punch them in the face.
And of course no one minds :D
Laurayne: Gay, Bi, Lesbian, we accept them all. :)
Thank You All...
You're among friends at Bronystate, Laurayne :3
Laurayne: You have NOTHING to worry about. :)
We all love you, Laurayne :)
/me is openly (but not obnoxiously) bi
Your Going To Make Me Cry...
Laurayne: Sorry. :$
tSparx|Hw: Impossible, pegasi, earth ponies, and unicorns are far too integrated into eachothers society to turn on eachother, luna is the only liability for an uprising
Well everypony im off to bed Moopy needs his rest talk to yall in the morning aight...............peace
Night, Moopy :)
See you, Moopy
Goodnight
aight late
It's very nice to meet someone like you, Laurayne. Glad to have you here. :)
Laurayne: it's not like I already know a few gay/lesbian people :3 welcome
Holy crap, its like im the only straight person in the room
DoctoDoctorWho: But I'm saying that while it's really likely to see Luna come back to rule, there's no way that she's then going to be able to stake enough legitimacy and/or popularity to rise up against Celestia -- even though the people of Equestria are accepting of Luna, she *was* just Nighmare Moon, no one wants to help NMM lead a rebellion, they lived in fear of her for centuries.
Nope, DoctoDoctorWho.
Anyway, I Just Thought Id Let You All Know Before My Obvious Attraction To Same-Gender Relationships Makes Anyone Feel Weird....
DoctoDoctorWho, erm. False. Hai.
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not.
And now, for something I like! http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/292302d97396ad2269237a1272c24268.jpg :D <3
DoctoDoctorWho: I am. WHoops.
And honestly, I think you'll find most people here are very open minded to those sort of things.
Laurayne: If it makes anyone feel weird, they should get over themselves, haha
HEY THERE YOU SEXY BRONYS!!!! :D
Pfft Join my club Laurayne I'm making jackets.
Granted, you'll be able to tell when they arn't.
IM BAACK
I prefer women, but if you prefer other genders I honestly don't mind. :)
o hai everyone
Ow My Eyes... :(
not that I hate homosexuals and their ilk, It just seems like half the pple here are gay/bi/lezz
Laurayne: What's wrong?
So...
/me Hugs Laurayne ^_^ Fillyfoolers united.
I wake up to get a glass of water
I Cant Keep Up :(
DoctoDoctorWho: I think it's way less than half.

Panda|Sleepies: I thought you were supposed to be asleep? :D
So what's the big deal? People are people.

Spectrum_Rush: :D
http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/132705653660.gif Fixd, Ninjazz
I gotts finish Mario Galaxy sometime....
and nothing productive was done that day... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM
Whos gonna stream?
.-.
Polydunami: I can imagine him saying that. :D
BTW MOVIE NIGHT IS TODAY!!!
So Ninjazz, what do you think of the first pony threads in /co/? :D
MadSurge, our history... seems so dirty.
Ow... I Cant Keep Up With PMs And THis At The Same Time :(
Whistler: I am streaming right now enjoy my black screen with magic circle.
Ninjazz: but also endearing, in a weird way :D
Laurayne: I know that feeling. :D
Oh, you. xD
MadSurge, well seeing how far we've come yes.
Ninjazz: so many people being confused at liking ponies :3
Can i haz TF2 plz :(
MadSurge, I don't blame them.
OH YEAH!
i forgot!
Ninjazz: we were all confused methinks :D
Wait
MOVIE NIGHT IS TODAY!!!
I'm not busy anymore.
Why do I find this video so entertaining? http://youtu.be/pwud6Qh4e_c
ONLY FRIDAY NIGHT!
I met a brony at shool today!
MadSurge, I still am. 6_9
Yeah, My Little Pony is not the first thing I got into that was first popularised by 4chan
AjIsAwsome and then i found more and more...
CrimsonPhoenix: Randomness is fun sometimes.
I meta pegasister at my school today :D
Whistler: Very nice.
Ninjazz: not me, I always liked cartoons :D and Powepuff Girls and Foster's Home were great :)
Wait... that was yesterday...
CrimsonPhoenixm silly.
It's important to allow a little simplicity into your life.
Polydunami, Wakfu?
Katawa Shoujo, actually
^
Well anyways my new brony friend said hell make me some AJ stickers!!!
I STILL haven't gotten past Lilly's route :S
I'm still on Emi's. -_-
Still have to try Katawa Shoujo
MadSurge, I know. I was just joking. I know very well why I like the show.
Polydunami, who's your "waifu"
Waifu?
Mai waifu
Is that some kind of martial arts?
/me should really get back to working on his fanfic
:3
it's a popular term in 4chan, especially in /a/
AJIsAwsome except i have no where to stick them lol
it means your virtual wife
Oh, really?
Ninjazz: when did you realize "Rarity is fabulous and best pony"? :P
as in so love with a character you want her to be yours
MadSurge, after Art of the Dress. After I heard her singing voice, i fell in love.
But mind, I wasn't a brony yet.
If I was my OC I would pull a tony stark and ship with everypony
Just appreciation for a character's voice.
Ninjazz: aaaah, makes lots of sense :$
So this would be the character I wish were real and with me?
I seriously wish I became a brony around the origin of Bronystate. Would've loved to see Vivi stream.
Polydunami, basically.
and I dont have any problems with that
Polydunami: the waifu, yes
hmmm strange
my browser crashed
Yeah, I knew what a waifu was the whole time :D
I don't like the term waifu.
Polydunami, O U.
Ninjazz: The definition?
oh gawd 4CHAN is leaking
Or the spelling?
Pretty much, AJIsAwesome|Busy
AJIsAwesome|Busy, the apparent requirments that come with it.
Polydunami, yeah, so who's your waifu?
pony tit's Pen stroke has a new story too!
Like she's your literal wife.
Polydunami: how could you lie :O, you must be punished http://i.imgur.com/HBgZD.png
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8fKBX3cvs
Ninjazz: That's not a requirement -- that's just what the word *means*
Have some electro swing, chat.
Well, I really wouldn't consider myself to be overly obsessed with any particular character...
tSparx|Hw, no. I've actually seen a bit of the apparent Waifu guide.
Well ok then
And I only summerized.
Theres a waifu guide?
Ninjazz: Thank you.
Ninjazz: "Waifu guide"?
tSparx|Hw, eyup.
I would just pull a tony stark and ship with EVERYPONY!
AJIsAwesome|Busy, a pleasure.
Ninjazz: I will admit to not really being in the communities that regularly use this word, but I didn't realize it originated from someplace.
bye everypony
so i met another brony today
Bye, DoctoDoctorWho :)
Cya DoctoDoctorWho.
fic's wont write themselves
and he showed me some pictures on his phone
sure enough
ship pics
i left
tSparx|Hw, to be fair, most can just say "mah waifu" and you'll know what they mean. BUT since I've seen the more hardcore base, I'd rather not confuse myself with them.
How would you confuse yourself with other people, Ninjazz? :S
:3
Polydunami, I are not grammar sensei.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. D:<
whoa there
Well, nobody's perfect!
calm down saipan boy
I need to see that movie
D:>

"They call me alchemist, turning tracks to gold; my name in lights -- but you better make it bold! They call me icy cause my chain is cold, making all my money from the philosopher's stone"
Wellp. It's twenty to four in the morning here in Vancouver.

Through the snow.
On fire.

And the intense heat
With that nagging woman in the back.

Besides most scary/creepy/gore is not allowed

Then you just gotta giggle at the ghostly
i will eat you
dough, its not allowed anyways
:( fine
scary is fine gore and violence are not.
/me puts ducttape over crystals mouth
Read the rules
scary is fine?
yay
Screamers arn't.
pornography, gore, shock images or any content or messages deemed overly sexual or obscene in nature .
sxreamers are the cheapest scares ever
No jump scares are.
that too
Same context.
When you least expect it.
nah some screamers actually get a reaction
you can even tell when its about to happen
:P
Just one long continuous loud noise with an unnerving picture.
Not a good screamer
ever played maze game?
oh god
not that
5 levels of calming easy puzzle
suddenly screamer
*cough cough* only 3...
Mine had 5 :/
ahhh scary maze
