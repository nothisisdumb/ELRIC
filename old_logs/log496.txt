<RAWRity> NullRadix: right now all we have to go on is this: Tarlokk tried to bloodbend Amon. Amon just fucking WALKED over and bitchslapped him.
<Canadian_Brony> crashes every hour, on the hour basically
<Om> clearly Sumica
<NullRadix> really, one would suspect Bloodbending to be nothing about willpower, unless you could .... counter bloodbend yourself?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Amon is Aang's secret love child nobody every knew about and is butthurt that he got no love from daddy
<panda_> kirzstryfe: seems legit
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: or, he's secretly Zuko's son.
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstyrfe umm, okay . . .
<MahBoi777> that seems like the best possible explanation
<panda_> RAWRity: or it is ZUKO
<Prick> that...thats actully sounds legit
<Om> NullRadix: Perhaps he is really buff?
<kirzstryfe> 8,6RAWRity, never said with who ;p
<Comet> I agree with RAWRity
<NullRadix> buff would have nothing to do with it
<RAWRity> or, he's Aang and Katara's other son, Bumi, who is upset at being the only non-bending child of the Avatar, and want to take out his daddy issues on the whole world.
<GabeMoist> kirzstryfe, dun dun DUUUUUN
<tresson> heres amon and twilight http://fav.me/d5156oy
<Sumica> 00,10You are all wrong. it's iroh.
<Canadian_Brony> panda_ Zuko worked with Aang to build Republic City and taught him Fire Bending
<Prick> oh even better could be Zuko or Zuko's sone? or did i miss that Zuko is already ded
<CrimsonPhoenix> THIS PMV
<RAWRity> because it's actually said on Nick.com's background page that Tenzin is the only Airbender of aang and Katara's children.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I got diabetes
<RAWRity> Prick: Zuko's alive.
<Prick> ok...i guess i gotta go finish from last ive seen avatar
*Biglaw bobs head
<RAWRity> he left his daughter to reign as Firelord, and now travels the world as a peace ambassador
<Comet> Twilight would die before losing her magic
<NullRadix> most of what goes on in your body is liquid related. The question is why it's so hard to "access" that liquid to perform bloodbending
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH BOY
<panda_> WANT YOU GONE!
<superretroworld> *sigh* already seen this
<Biglaw> wow
<tresson> portal! :D
<Biglaw> GLaDOS
<panda_> CUE REMIX!
<xmasskills> panda:
<xmasskills> panda_
<metalzeldabrony> well this should be interesting
<panda_> xmasskills: whats up?
<Comet> is this what i think it is
<xmasskills> panda_: i know about everything
<RyunosukeKnT> its not so much hard to do, rather no one wants to teach it
<panda_> xmasskills: what did I do now?
<Sumica> 00,10NullRadix cause much like metal bending, they have to feel the bits they can controll
<RAWRity> NullRadix: probably has to do with bending something you can't see yourself, as well as working it against the muscles and whatnot
<Canadian_Brony> okay, now I'm really pissed off at my computer's internet, and the current stream isn't helping . . .
<diddutz> oh did you think i ment you? :P
<Biglaw> I can do a good GLaDOS impression
<dalekkahn> Amon may be a water bender and that's how he countered bloodbending
<Midnight_Tempest> Amon doesnt have bending powers
<dalekkahn> How do we know?
<Starchaser> finished this game last week
<CrimsonPhoenix> Midnight_Tempest, how can you say that?
<dalekkahn> we don't
<RAWRity> I'm still going with "The spirits, most likely Koh, are fucking with the Avatar."
<tresson> what does amon have? :O
<Biglaw> Amon is a robot. The end
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: that we KNOW OF
<Canadian_Brony> dalekkahn he can take the bending away from benders, a skill reserved for the Avatar
<Midnight_Tempest> CrimsonPhoenix: cause i can... its all speculation anyway
<panda_> FUCK YEAH!
<RyunosukeKnT> .hack!
<Twi_Fi> Oh wow
<diddutz> Midnight_Tempest: but Amon can bend bending powers...
<RyunosukeKnT> that helba
<Twi_Fi> Been a long time since I have last seen this.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ahh way to make my night improve, thanks sumica.
<Shamroc> Sumica: quantem? cause i dont want to go through having to deal with the little girl having the same name as me..
<Comet> What the fuck
<Midnight_Tempest> diddutz: human willpower can overpower anything, this is one truth i believe in

<P0N-3> Like some of that!
<Shamroc> cher3ry: at that made it 9 pm of yesterday..
<cher3ry> Go into your time settings, and turn OFF automatic time syncronization.

<R-Dash5000> Past 1,000 meters.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> yes mica

<GlutenFreeJenkins> Will it break Solar orbit?
<R-Dash5000> Past 2,000.
<Phase4> 00,02so infinite distance
<dalekkahn> Sumica, do thrusters and fuel tanks from previous flights persist into the next flights?
<R-Dash5000> Past 3,000.
<JRP2234> hello......ive waited here for you.........Everlooong
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ...
<cher3ry> Earth's escape velocity is 11.2 km/s. The Sun's is 617.5. So I doubt you can achieve solar escape
<GlutenFreeJenkins> He did yesterday. >_<
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: there's mods for that. full replacement sets and stuff
<cher3ry> Well, I'm guessing :D
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Lolk. ^_^
<R-Dash5000> Vegeta, what the the scouter say about the altitiude?
<R-Dash5000> IT'S OVER 9000!!!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Here we go. :3
<R-Dash5000> BRB.
<dshannon> uhhhhhhh

<cher3ry> built by the lowest bidder.

<dalekkahn> There are just terrorists camping the spawn point
<Magical_pablez94> does anyone knows a non megaupload download link for Amnesia?
<Magical_pablez94> I'd like to play it, but cannot find a valid link...
<StupidSexyCJ> one does not simply launch a rocket without a countdown
<GlutenFreeJenkins> NNnnnope Magical_pablez94
<Magical_pablez94> ANYPONY ELSE?
<cher3ry> In German, und English, I know how to count down... und I'm learning Chinese, says Werner von Braun
<R-Dash5000> Lag?
<StupidSexyCJ> I wonder if you can fly around the planet somehow
<dalekkahn> That might be that the engine doesn't get enough time to process things when time is warped
<cher3ry> you mean... orbit?
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :|
<TrixieBaconMuffin> "...Rocket engine burning fuel so fast , up into the night sky so vast, burning metal through the atmosphere, earth remains in worry hate and fear, with the hateful battles raging on, rockets flying to the glowing sun, through the empires of eternal void, freedom from their final suicide..." clearly Sabbath foresaw exactly what you are doing now ^^
<Phase4> 00,02we'll go at night XD
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :3
<dalekkahn> Sumica is best comedian
<dshannon> uhhhhhh
<P4NGYA> those astronauts do not look happy
<Phase4> 00,02sas is on?
<dshannon> that didn't look promising
<R-Dash5000> Past 40.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> The middle one is actually scared?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> GlutenFreeJenkins: ikr he used to be so happy
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Yeah...
<TrixieBaconMuffin> so you like sunbathing ? well do we have a treat for you!
<Phase4> 00,02i played this for 10 min a while ago, got into space and allmost into orbit
<cher3ry> slipping free of the surly straitjacket of Earth's feeble gravitational pull...
<Phase4> 00,02then my staging failed
<Phase4> 00,02and it span to the earth
<Phase4> 00,02parachute worked though
<EggWhite> Would anyone like to come to #bronyfunds the chat is withering away.
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<R-Dash5000> Is it almost 6:00 am?
<Phase4> 00,02i didnt put a seperator there actualy, worked anyway
<Phase4> 00,02well... i hit water
<Phase4> 00,02no fule tank, had a seperator for that
<Phase4> 00,02fuel'
<Phase4> 00,02*derp*
<cher3ry> the clusters can draw fuel from anywhere
<Starflash> there's so much blue in this chat.
<Starflash> Dat Phase.
<Phase4> 00,02i thought you ment the liquid tanks for some derp reason
<TrixieBaconMuffin> whats your final speed gonna be ?
<Phase4> 00,02rcs tank was attached
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :o
<Phase4> 00,02map?
<dshannon> XD
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Lol, I loved that.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> lol
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<dshannon> wait you sent two to orbit?
<P4NGYA> aren't orbits supposed to be ellipses?
<dshannon> solar orbit I mean
<TrixieBaconMuffin> lets hope that dirtbag moon doesnt pull you off course
<Dark_of_Max> lol
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TrixieBaconMuffin: i dont think he needs to worry about that now
<TrixieBaconMuffin> whats your speed ?
<Phase4> 00,02its about 3KM/s
<Phase4> 00,023.8 i think
<Dark_of_Max> OMG 1.000.000.0
<R-Dash5000> DEAR SWEET CELESTIA!! 1 MILLION!!
<cher3ry> because you're approaching apogee.
<cher3ry> slowly, but approaching it
<cher3ry> because I have done this before. :D
<cher3ry> that and you're still climbing, therefore approaching apogee
<Phase4> 00,02he's achived escape
<Phase4> 00,02there is no apogee
<cher3ry> for his solar orbit there is.
<Phase4> 00,02true
<Alchemist> why are the astronauts scared at the bottom of the screen?
<Phase4> 00,02but he's going for impact, not orbit
<Magical_pablez94> fuck this awful connection.
<R-Dash5000> 1.5 M.
<dshannon> we shall see!
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, dont think the rcs is doing much, i'd save the fuel
<Phase4> 00,02i say right as he turns it off XD
<Dark_of_Max> yay
<dalekkahn> What is the world coming to when you can't even crash a ship into the sun
<TrixieBaconMuffin> so at 8 lightminutes to the sun that will take him about .... 2 years ? or did i gravely miscalculate ?
<Phase4> 00,02moah fire!
<JRP2234> "I just proposed a settlement to dick with them" lol
<cher3ry> well... huh.
<R-Dash5000> It's almost 6 pm here.
<cher3ry> yay\
<Phase4> 00,02whered the sun go?
<Phase4> 00,02lol clipping
<dshannon> I thought you were going for impact?
<cher3ry> I don't think you're gonna hit your target there.
<dshannon> ah
<cher3ry> ah, yes...
<Phase4> 00,02the thing shows it
<Phase4> 00,02horizion view thing
<Dark_of_Max> 10.000.000.0
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ._.
<R-Dash5000> It's 6 am EST/5 am CST/3 am PST.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> 11:00am BST
<cher3ry> just 11k more speed to lose
<Phase4> 00,02dont think you have enough fuel XD
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02but that would still be a lot of speed
<TrixieBaconMuffin> so your guys are "still" panicing ? shouldnt they star accepting their fate and kill themselves ?
<thegt90> i built a all liqud fuel rocket
<R-Dash5000> Sweet celestia, is he actually gonna go to you?
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02dem massive orbits
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :o
<cher3ry> you slow as you approach appogee, no matter how far you are from it
<Phase4> 00,02yeah.... you're aproaching Ap... i cant spell that word
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> sumi if that other solar orbit is still moving it might meet up with your current one
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma go get some food
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> yep
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> they do cross after Apeugee though Sumica
<Phase4> 00,02wow, you are loosing a lot of speed
<Phase4> 00,02dont think you'll hit the sun but you will bleed most of it off
<cher3ry> but he'll gain it back on the other side...
<NommyDash> Hahaha:D
<TrixieBaconMuffin> he'll also pick it all back up after appogee

<Shimmer> Yesterday I had a party at my house with some new friend. After they had left I found out one of my oldest friends had downloaded some MLP p*rn on my pc, which coulda been easily misclicked as we were using spotify and utube. He also knew I was going to have new people over. I literally told him to f*ck off after that. So who went over the line, me or him?
<Kandarihu> In the video screens at the beginning and end of the single player game, he's the character seen demonstrating evacuation procedures and such.
<Shimmer> new friends*
<Espeon> But I'm not coffee
<Espeon> ;-;

<Elondras> Shimmer: he
<Kandarihu> Did I just see GLaDOS on the screen?

<sub06905> well its about to be 6 am and the sun is up, imma go to sleep bye everypony :)

<Elondras> well done
<Invi> Kandarihu lolwut?
<Dark_Horst> is that alternate universe thing canon for portal 2 or did the fans come up with it?
<Dark_Horst> wasnt mentioned in portal one, i think
<Kandarihu> Er, a 30 minute reel of Cave Johnson in the PeTI
<WorldTraveler> it still doesn't have very many followers, not like my derpy blog at 820+ followers
<CrazyCherry> Hiya Spitfire!!!
<Invi> Dark_Horst Valve made a own video about selling their stuff to alternate universes, so i guess that could be canon
<Aeina> Cave Johnson wasn't mentioned in the original Portal, he was only patched in by Valve somewhat before Portal 2 launched
<sagas> WorldTraveler: Oh just rub it in why dont we
<Ascendant> oi Drake
*Ascendant pokes
<Dark_Horst> Invi: can i find that on youtube?

<Ascendant> And you will find that a lot of people don't like coloured text tbh
<Drake> 04yeah I've noticed
<Ascendant> It actually is very annoying
<sagas> Kabaka: Yay 80s parodies!

<Ascendant> He's just like that
<Chimera> so bleh/

<Elondras> Hi WallDives
<Malavolent> Hey Phase4, what is the furthest you got?
<NickelMask> What game is this?
<WallDives> I've been here >.>
<Phase4> 00,02this is only the second launch i've done in this game
<Invi> Ninjazz that were the best 4 days of my life :D
<Phase4> 00,02perhaps less fule
*Shimmer noms WallDives
<Alchemist> Lil_B: Hi there!
<Tax> This is...random.

<Drake> 04Hi
<Phase4> 00,02allso i have no control surfaces
<Drake> 04How are you Espeon?
<Ninjazz> Invi: What do you mean?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oops
<Very_Silly_Filly> You're probably screwed then
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Damn, I'm hungry. BUt there is actually nothing in the house I can eat. D:
<Shimmer> Eat the house
<Invi> Ninjazz Ninjazz i was 4 days at the metalfest in Loreley

<TrixieBaconMuffin> hi CCCP
<Invi> Ninjazz \m/
<Espeon> Pretty decent!
<d3rb> who needs secure rockets anyway
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ^_^
<Espeon> And you people/assorted things?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> dat wobbly rocket
<d3rb> just adds weight
<GlutenFreeJenkins> It's just dancing.
<QT_Marks> looks safe
<Very_Silly_Filly> I love how Erbert is the only one smiling
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then again, he's always smiling
<CrazyCherry> JRP2234: Da fuq....
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Erbert is always smailing. :3
<Phase4> 00,02this is going far too well
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ^
<Tax> Dat surprisingly appropriate dog.
<JRP2234> CrazyCherry watch it all
<Alchemist> Lil_B: this is just for you. I will send you a picture, something chemistry related. Can you tell me whats wrong with it?
<WallDives> If your plans are proceeding without a disruption or a hitch, you have walked into a trap.
<Lil_B> Alchemist well... I'll try my best ;)
<Very_Silly_Filly> IT'S A TARP
<Spell-of-Gaming> Space again?

<d3rb> getting low on fuel.....
*Drake just realised the time
<Spell-of-Gaming> Just make sure it's not on EASY MODO
<Espeon> Hah x3
<Spell-of-Gaming> /couldnotresistmakingajoke
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haa
<Very_Silly_Filly> You're spinning uncontrollably
<valoreins|Work> are we going to the moon again?
<Alchemist> Lil_B: you dont have to think about anything fancy.
<d3rb> trying to valoreins|Work
<Phase4> 00,02well
<d3rb> now they are screwed
<Phase4> 00,02that kinda worked
<CrazyCherry> Gotta love the middle guy.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Erbert is best Kerb
<Lil_B> Alchemist wait, I'm trying to get the right words XD
<WorldTraveler> dam
<Invi> Ninjazz i even met a brony :)
<WorldTraveler> what's the apogee on that thing
<Tax> Deep wide bell wonder. Ok then.
<WorldTraveler> can u actually achieve orbit with this game?
<Ninjazz> Invi: Nice! Who was his favorite pony? :D
<Malavolent> Phase4 are you gonna nuke the Earth?
<Lil_B> Alchemist you normaly use it to seperate 2 liquids... there shouldn't be something solid in there
<Very_Silly_Filly> WorldTraveler: Yeah
<d3rb> awww crap
<WorldTraveler> how?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica did it yesterday and started orbiting the sun
<Alchemist> Lil_B: thats correct :D
<Phase4> 00,02oh poo
<WorldTraveler> lol.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Haha
<Phase4> 00,02forgot the detatch for the rcs fuel
<Very_Silly_Filly> Love how they all smile
<WorldTraveler> lololol
<RaveBrony> :D
<QT_Marks> HHNNNGGGG
<Tax> And then they burnt up on re-entry.
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Invi> Ninjazz Rainbow :D but i had no oppotunity to talk with him much :(
<Alchemist> Lil_B: its a seperating funnel. And what you see is 300 dollars worth of experiment going out the window :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> WEE
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: You opened WAY to early
<Phase4> 00,02meh
<Lil_B> Alchemist because thats Professional work right there XD
<Ninjazz> Invi: Atleast we know we're not alone. :$
<Malavolent> I hope we will eventually get on the moon.
<sagas> Well what was the point of that? You went up and back down
<Phase4> 00,02Landed
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've already made it to the moon a few times
<Malavolent> Sumica almost got it yesterday.
<Very_Silly_Filly> But I landed dead
<Alchemist> Lil_B: its actually an experiment of mine, and it turned out a chemical I ordered had impurities in it that killed the reaction.
<Malavolent> Very_Silly_Filly: How so?
<sagas> Phase4: The stream is horribly delayed.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Malavolent: I got a parachute failure
<Tax> Sploosh.
<Invi> Ninjazz how was the end of the challenge? :D
<Malavolent> Very_Silly_Filly: Well, that's not nice.
<Phase4> 00,02probably
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I plummeted and exploded and died
<sagas> Phase4: Like 30 sec+
<Alchemist> Lil_B: glad my uni pays for it and not me.
<Ninjazz> Invi: Tiring... :$ I think my sleep pattern changed. :D
<YokusaHHart> lol, I fell asleep at my desk :D
<Lil_B> Alchemist oh, was supposed to happen?
<Espeon> I will be heading out though, so see yous
<sagas> Your ships unstable. Phase4
<Alchemist> Lil_B: nope. Should have had a reddish suspension and no precipitation.
<Phase4> 00,02tis a bit
<Malavolent> Needs more rockets.
<Drake> 04aww
<Tax> Now give it 5 more engines and paint it with go faster stripes.
<Drake> 04bye
<valoreins|Work> and more solar power from celestia
<sagas> Give it flames!
<d3rb> and a sweet spoiler with neons!
<|Discord|> This game, it confuzzels me
<sagas> I wish i knew what all these parts do
<d3rb> spinners on the rocket outlets
<Tax> Send it to the moon.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: just thought I share the failure with someone :)
<Tax> Put an xbox in the back seat hooked up to a giant monitor in the floor.
<sagas> Whats the nuke button do?
<MadSurge> This song is one of the best PMV out there <3
<Tax> And a fish tank.
<|Discord|> Alchemist: Sharing faliure? Sounds awesome
<JRP2234> d3rb http://youtu.be/EqJCEhE4tz4 watch it all
<d3rb> its a pretty easy game to pick up sagas, pretty straight forward
<Elondras> what's the name of this PMV?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mind the youtube links, JRP2234
<|Discord|> JRP2234: DAMit man! No video links during stream!
<Lil_B> Alchemist I had a mistake with these funnals recently too, but it was totally my very own failure XD
<MadSurge> Elondras: FlutterWonder
<d3rb> gahhhh...mega man 3, i got the nes cartridge for that
<YokusaHHart> this song
<Elondras> MadSurge: thanks
<JRP2234> opp i forget the pm
<Alchemist> Lil_B: did it leak or something?
<JRP2234> im tired as shit
<d3rb> lol, i can appreciate that
<Lil_B> Alchemist i left open the funnel while inserting a sample... twice
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02the bigger more powerfull engine
<Tax> Add dynametric tail fins.
<Phase4> 00,02or the slightly less powerfull one
<Phase4> 00,02with thrust vectoring
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bigger
<Alchemist> Discord: sharing one's failure might help those you share with :)
<Phase4> 00,02bigger it is
<Invi> Phase4 bigger is better
<Tax> Tell that to Goliath.
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma try this first then try figure a good way to attach more rockets
<YokusaHHart> So this game literally turns you into a rocket scientist....
<Tax> You must construct additional rockets.
<Darkness_pony> is this tf2?
<Invi> Tax the fight was unfair. David had a range weapon
<Darkness_pony> oh no
<Alchemist> Lil_B: it sounds to be correctable.
<Tax> Invi: lol
<QT_Marks> To Luna! Again!
<YokusaHHart> so far so good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just by looking at the top I can tell this will fail somewhat
<QT_Marks> I like the part where it wiggles
<valoreins|Work> looks unstable though... or maybe its just me...
<YokusaHHart> oh dear...
<Tax> Looks like it really should have been built to spin.
<Darkness_pony> god im wearing earphones @.@
<WallDives> YokusaHHart, bad question incoming, but Hart Foundation mean anything to you?
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02that failed
<Very_Silly_Filly> You're fucked
<Very_Silly_Filly> And told you :P
<Soital> 12Theres jobs going to legoland
<Soital> 12how awesome is that
<Darkness_pony> o.o
*Soital wants to play with the legos
<valoreins|Work> oh my...
<YokusaHHart> WallDives: Lol no, it part of my Psydonym, Meredith HeimdallHart
<Tax> Yeah that thing is right out of there.
<Alchemist> those astronauts seem like to be high as hell. Literally and figureatively.
<Elondras> why does he keep smiling? :D
<WallDives> ah.
<WallDives> ok, sorry.
<WallDives> back to lurking.
<Darkness_pony> I want him to play amnesia
<Very_Silly_Filly> Keep thrusting
<Tax> ^ lol
<YokusaHHart> It's okay, I can understand the confusion...
<TrixieBaconMuffin> try to hit the launchpad
<Invi> this seems like it shouldn't do this
<Very_Silly_Filly> Aim for the ground and go into it
<Phase4> 00,02all in all
<Tax> It seems like he's on his way to becoming a pavement pancake.
<Phase4> 00,02that went well
<Phase4> 00,02so far no ones died
<Phase4> 00,02thats not right
<Phase4> 00,02MOAR ROCKETS
<Lil_B> Alchemist we had 1 Sample(Liquid) and we took 3x10ml out there into cups so everything could evaporate, after that we had to dissolve the solid ramins in water and fill it into the funnel, i left it open and everything went on the table
<Elondras> time for Amnesia :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Why is there so much science!?
<Invi> because science is awesome^^
<Alchemist> Lil_B: ouch, then it I retract my previous statement :D
<Lil_B> Alchemist 2 times, fortunatly the 3 time i did it right and the Titration was still good enough for me to get a B Grade
<YokusaHHart> MOAR GO FAST STRIPES!!!
<Tax> Why don't you just make a really big catapult and launch it that way? :P
<QT_Marks> if at first you don't succeed, more rockets!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Here's an idea, add like a massive pillar, full of thrusters and fuel
<Lil_B> Alchemist *Titration afterward we did something in the funnel... i forget what axactly we did in there :/
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's how I managed to get to the moon
<needsmorewubwub> i just joined. what are we watching
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmmm
<Alchemist> Lil_B: they dont give much time to do an experiment i presume.
<Capn_Gavn> Lil_B: chemistry ISA?
<lul> Who always broadcasts these streams?
<lul> I think its Phase4
<Very_Silly_Filly> Loads of different people

<lul> Can i broadcast mine
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<YokusaHHart> yay
<Very_Silly_Filly> There's like 10-15 different mods eho can stream
<Lil_B> Alchemist they do, but not enought to start again from the very Beginning once you screwed up, but enough time to not have to do everything hastly
<Lil_B> Capn_Gavn I don't know what ISA is, but I am learning in the field of chemistry currently ;)
<Capn_Gavn> investigative skills assesment
<Very_Silly_Filly> That will NOT list
<User0> Phase4: I don't think that is enough fuel...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wants one less level of crap
<Alchemist> Capn_Gavn: what exactly does that mean :)
<Phase4> 00,02this looks good
<Invi> dat giant Piano :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not sure that'll lift
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's an organ, silly

<Elondras> oh wow
<User0> already a good start
<Phase4> 00,02HOLY WHAT
<Phase4> 00,02it works!

<Very_Silly_Filly> :)
<Tax> Like a...something.
<lul> Can someone tell me what game is this
<Phase4> 00,02this has no right to work

<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Thats what i did earlier... But it wouldnt let me D:
<CCCP> Is this game fun?
<alexxm> who pinged me my chat derped

<WorldTraveler> having a rocket like what you have would spin the rocket apart
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: well, damn.
<User0> CCCP: it is entertaining, to say the least
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Then it said something about 'blacklisting' it O.o

<Phase4> 00,02well poo
<Invi> the right one's face says WTF?
<Capn_Gavn> the dangers of having a cup between the keyboard and mouse
<User0> NullRadix: very true.
<WorldTraveler> now to achieve orbit you have to turn the spacecraft perpendicular to the grund
<Phase4> 00,02i've achived escape
<NullRadix> well, given that the last 5-10 rockets exploded on the launch pad...
<Phase4> 00,02and have no control

<Very_Silly_Filly> I can't figure out the bloody equation
<Barbetos> Petrified_Discord I suppose but then it is less fun.
<CrazyCherry> Phase4: Less esplosion, more succes.

<MadSurge> Vordox: Slowbeef (who made the first Let's Play) and Diabetus (who LPed Battletoads)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chances are he's already played a game like this, and probably likes it about as much as he likes the raccoon one.
<alexxm> this had a director
<MadSurge> alexxm: ikr

<String_Shredder> Nittany: oh, God
<Chains> Nittany_Discord: I have a question for you!
<alexxm> oh AVGN i watched this when he was still the angry nintendo nerd
<Nyria> Vordox: It's a game company~

<Chains> Pardon me, sir, but is this Sparta?
<riverhippo2> I was satisfied witht the fact that Derpy's new voice is the one the writer wanted in the first place anyways
<Lil_B> The reason why there is a counter is because in the Last Stage in Die Hard will contain ALL the Enemies you haven't shot up to this point
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Who would be the LJN of modern gaming?

<CrimsonPhoenix> iammrcrap, no nonpic link during stream
<iammrcrap> sorry:'(
<Onyxia> alexxm: still studying but fine. and urs?
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord kinda, Nintendo had a policity at the time, that allowed a Publisher to only release 3 games per years on the NES, LJN Itself was just a doughter company by THQ, so they could push out more then 3 games...
<riverhippo2> piclinks are ok? what is this linkist diatrod? :P
<Hawkie> hm?
<alexxm> i'm good Onyxia what are you studying for
<Kumatora> spaggetti zone... :D

<Hawkie> ok XD
<Onyxia> alexxm: thx
<MadSurge> Oh this game too D:
<riverhippo2> this is just my opinion, but i dont think action fighting games didnt really get good until snes gen
<Dark_Horst> the fuck?
<Tovler> String_Shredder: about $20 a month, but you get exclusive videos, Hats for your avatar, and other stuff.
<CK|GW2> >Wolverine
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord nope, I remembered something incorrectly, LJN was its own company during the NES era, and they really just made shitty games (or rather the people who developed for the), the founder of LJN later also founded THQ
<CK|GW2> >Claws drain health
<alexxm> why would they do that
<CK|GW2> WAT
*Nyria shots a pillow~ "Ow my leg~"

<String_Shredder> Tovler: isn't gold like, 60$ a year?
<alexxm> fucking bubbles
<Tovler> Nittany_Discord: maybe. but how else would a $500 console be sold?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tovler: Advertising.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And knowing Microsoft, they'll only give a month or three of Gold or whatever free.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Are you guys talking about Playstation 3?
<Kumatora> i think they are talking about xbox...just guessing.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And maybe they'll unlock the anti-used games tech if you pay for gold. ;p

<Litwick> ((As in without knowing it came from the Xmen arcade game.))
<Lil_B> GAME TRIVIA: X-MAN had a 5th "Secret" Level with Magneto, after you beat all levels, you have to press a secret code ( I think a+b+select+start), which stands on the backside of the Cartradge, and THEY MESSED IT UP "+A, +B, together with start)... and the end screen... plain text
<Onyxia> good graphics? ok

<TheShipsAreBurning> genisisi
<Alchemist> I lost my enthusiasm for new games a while ago. No real innovation, or new gaming experience, just more rehashed content and graphics... I tend to prefer playing decade old games than the new ones.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is there a Gala level with a playable Magneto?

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: the prison level...my god they are geniuses
<Tovler> That presentation felt unscripted, but w/e. /me looks for old Aisha Tyler Talk Soup clips.
<Alchemist> BronySith you know that funny pic related to the prison level of Amnesia?
<alexxm> User0 what ending did you get
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Amnesia is boring. I haven't finished it.

<Rodney> is somebody streaming?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AVGN's first reviews
