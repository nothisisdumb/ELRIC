13i am staring at you
0,14inb4 Asuka cosplay
Satisfaction woop woop
Style wise, I prefer the SM-90 cage, but if I were to wear one and actually play, I'd totally use the SM-50 because I'd feel safer wearing it.
Dark_Horst: you mean rednecks?
determined asuka
0,14I see Asuka has her SRS face on
/me applies coconut shrimp directly to jaymoo's forehead.
/me sings Crazy Bruce's Liqour
DoctoDoctorWho: yep
say, we should watchthe evangelion movies shortly before the 3rd one comes out
Jmo: Push me and then just touch me so i may get my satisfaction?
/me brings forth a Salmon to the fight
DoctoDoctorWho: more like, why so british?
What I'm curious is
Shizuka: sorry man, but youre not my type
Was wondering who would do that
Did they stop the retro one simple because it didnt fit safety standards?
13mann?
yep
i knwo i heard a bunch of em sound british
Maaaaaaaaan
i dont need yo hand outs
I loved the music video for that song. :3
A duel?
You would Ninjazz.
Shizuka: wait, your a girl?
actually, he said aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiirrrr
13ja.....
superretroworld: She is.
Dark_Horst: because they are the comic relief faction, strong enough to kick ass, funny enough to make the crapsack galaxy bearable.
Shizuka: im sorry i didnt know that :(
/me slaps Jmo with the Salmon
0,14...You know, truth be told, I can't picture Asuka cooking
Oh my.
u no me too well jaymoo.
0,14I'd figure she'd get Shinji to do it for her
I got slapped.
superretroworld: It's alright. you're not the only one who does that.
in here, everybody's default gender is Thing
she would yell at the food and scare it into making itself
^
i mean, how many of us thought sumica was a girl at first?
EVERYONE
no mine's guy
Where did I go wrong in life to get slapped.
0,14Not me
AJIsAwesome: ik, but i feel bad for doing that
easy
Wait, Sumica is male?!
u became a butt pirate
jk, I know :D
I can't remember if I thought Sumica was male/female or not?
Touche.
more like Sumica led on for people to believe he was a girl
*.
Sumica was kindof an asshole about telling me he was a guy
Asuka hates me :(
It was pretty obvious.
You slap everyone with a fish and one day someone is going to slap back.
That roll of the r
hello everyone
orly dwr
u r obvious 2
Hey there, flutterchu
We always referred to Sumi as a he.

You leave bronystate for a few weeks. You come back and... http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7qw5dKeb91rs49uo.jpg
TheRandomkid321: :D
no TheRandomkid321, thats what happens when March came around for bronystate
We need november nao!!
0,14well, I'm off to sleep before dad wakes up
The only time the chat is EXTREMELY full is usually when a new episode is streaming.
Night Saaaxy
0,14have a good night everyone and enjoy the stream!
nite SaxyPretender
night.
night you SaxyPretender
bye SaxyPretender
Night, SaxyPretender. :)
night Saxy
TheRandomkid321 that's not full that's overflowing
Where did the september theory even come from?
what would that be?
dat Simpsons reference?
September is Season 3
the last two series?
That season 3 would come out in September.
pfffft
night SaxyPretender
huh, i thought it was november
its probably going to premier in November
like it did last season
13season 3 is november
it is november but alot of people (including myself) believed it to be september
Oh it is?
confirmed?
oh wait nvm, i need to read chat further before saying someth :P
nite SaxyPretender
it is but they were refering to the theory it's coming in September which has obviously been proven flase
13we don't have a specific date but the ads are already out on the sites that it's november
*false
sweet
Shizuka : Really then?
cant wait for 7000 IRC users >_<
so its just 13 eps then, huh. 13 is a bad number
So many people to slap.
:>
As society dictates it to be.
I'm just curious where a romour that got so many epople believing it originated from.
I never saw 13 as a bad number.
twilight_sprinkle : i think there will be more
Shizuka: viewers. Not chatters
Well ifi t's not true then the Hub is gonna look silleh and shiall hear from mah lawyer >:(
Shizuka: WHen did that happen? :O
Maid_RainBow: thatd be good
also its funny that in some countries 3 is considered to be gods number
13wait i was high
13anyway
so Gaben is satan
>.>
Shizuka : so only November but no date yet?
13the day the finale aired, ponychat reported like 17000 connected users
That's always lovely to say!
The most viewers was 7k
17000? :S
Wow.
most chatters was 4k
Shizuka was high
no 7000
13our analytics showed 17000 unique users over the course of the hour
1377000 hits
im talking max :p
but okay
Mad Max?
D:
GIIIBBBBBSOOOON!
Even when I'm way doing PS3 stuff, jaymoo hits me with fish.
13keep in mind that was over the course of the hour
When S3 is streamed us regulars need to stay together. Which is why they have all those separate rooms. IMO of course.
13or rather, by hour is the finest detail we could get
Shizuka : can you play Curtins from peterGabrial?
only4u Ninjazz <3
Im predicting an IRC max of 5000 for S3 premiere
13mm i should throw that in before i end
/me feels speshul. ;__;
so speshul.

Where is Nittany? XD
13shinji whined way too much for me to like him
Shizuka: In which version?
13both
shinji whined while asuka got slaughtered to shreds, so i cant really like him after that
0_o o_0
13in rebuild he went after rei and let asuka get a bridge dropped on her
13so he still sucks
dude looked like a lady
<.< I thought you liked him way more in the second when he had some balls.
night, everypony
Shizuka: Err... Isn't that a spoiler...?
bed time for me
night
Shinj is the Bitch of Asuka
Goodnight Sylandest
thank you for the stream, Shizuka. It was most peaceful and relaxing
I have started reading SURVIVE THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK. God I hope when iot happes I am a carrier.

TheRandomkid321, /)
SO!
Anyone doing any Pony Games around her?
Here*
AdmaTheDuck (\
Woo go patient group Zero!
Vordox: elaborate "doing"
"Creating"
Is that Asuka? <.<
How to spell AdamTheDuck.
Vordox: i think quick_thinker wanted to make a game, but he was just starting learning programming for it so
13is me
O.o
13from high school anyway
...
Shizuka: *Prays to see you on stream someday*
There we go.
13nope
Good job diddums.
Shizuka: You got to go to a Con ONCE in your life!
/me gives Jmo another lick
13nope
twilight_sprinkle: Hmm, which code?
Get off meh
Well tomorrow is either school or excursian in which Iget the day off for I am not going because my class is full of buckwits. They bully me :(
Shizuka: are you that shy? :(
13yup
Vordox: c++
twilight_sprinkle: Oh mai, hardcore games
13bad experience with internet people in the past
Shizuka: I can understand that...
O:
So there isn't going to be a Shizucon? :<
Meeting people from the net has gone good for meh, Guess im just lucky
Vordox: yah i guess, i dont think he knew what he was getting into though, but itd be cool if he managed to do it
But I want a plush pyro...
13so a random art that someone did for me in school is the closest anyone ever gets
Shizuka: But it shouldn't stop you from going where you want in real life, with new people or not. History is history, but you should learn from it, no?
twilight_sprinkle: Hope so! C++ makes you able to make ANY game
blue eyes and pink heair should narrow it down a bit :P
13including the best game of all
13troubleshoot dat error
Vordox: isnt visual c++ different though?
Shizuka: :D I'm not sure...
So I went on omegle finally... It was something like this... Penis... Penis... Fake breats... penis... Small Penis... Fake Penis.... Oh finally oh wait. They skipped me....
13Mutterguy: hasn't been pink in years
twilight_sprinkle: Nah, C++ is c++, unless you think of the other codes, c and c#
/me shrugs
13naturally blonde
Shizuka: Dem clue...
>.>
13so blonde hair blue eyes narrows it down to... about half the girls in the country
Shizuka: I'll visit you someday. :)
yep
Just randomly saying it, heh.
Vordox: hm ok. i forget, whats the difference between c++ and c#? i remember that the the # actually stands for 4 pluses
13C# has nothing to do with the Cs
computer about to die. I'll be on later.
13it's microsoft's spawn
Bye TheRandomkid321
twilight_sprinkle: C = Base Coding, C++ = Easier to code, C# = Easiest. Or something.
Basically, interface changes.
oh so the sharp is basically a window
...
-pane
my programming teacher explained what the ++ standed for, and he said that c# means c++++ but iforget why
Interface
Vordox, C++ is an extention to C, C# is a completely different language thats designed to look like C++ while internally being closer to java
Easier to code in C3
c#*
Well it's still inspired by eachother, so I see them as Sequels.
13C# does intermediate bytecode run on a VM
its 'easier' because of what Shizuka said
13C an C++ go to machine code
damnitninja
java is like a death mechinec_c
Native Machine code...
I want that knowledge.
13okay
13sec
Code is mentioned, Phase pops up.
memory is automatically managed in java and C#
Jmo, ikr!
13http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html do that
We now know how to summon him.
13buy the book if you want the rest of the VM implementation
13totally worth it
bb
13i built mine in gmod so :3
How about no Shizuka :P Not yet.
Shizuka : I love this song sinds you played Myst i believe
I love one thing about all these damn engine codes, Phase4
13Vordox: http://i.imgur.com/30EGP.jpg but it's awesome
The easier it is, the more restricted it is.
im actually trying to code something in c++ right now, but its not working right, not a hard program though..
Shizuka, can you set up the fireplace.mp4 thingy again? :3
I'm WAY over my head already in Coding, Shizuka. I'm a game designer, I'm not supposed to do it yet, unless I really have gone full steam into a code.
Vordox, it's a tradeoff, javascript makes ui work INCREDIBLY easy but it is fully async, some things are easier to do synchrynously
Phase4: I know...
Not even saying please, tsk tsk AdamTheDuck.
Phase4: I hate it... That's the thing I'mr eally pissed off lately.
Yay \:3/
So many engine, so less functionanility
/me huggles Shizuka
that reminds me
i still have to figure this list shit out
Java/C# manage memory automatically, but you lose pointers, a bit of performance, and are forced to use the object based structure
it's starting to piss me off
22 inch monitor makes an alomst reasonable sized fire place
11,02o3o
Phase4: <--- Prefers the object structure, and not the Class Structure.
Damn so many people getting angry lately.
Buytoast, each 'node' in a list has a pointer to the next node
SB
Arcane: the asian one is better :3

No clue what that means Shizuka :P
which makes derpy run on screen
13there's more but i don't wanna dig through my repo atm
twilight_sprinkle: FiM++ which is an imaginative code
Shizuka, i was just off to pastebin to write that down and add functions :P
SB ; A ; I dont have my car yet though D:

13http://hg.vortalcord.net/learnc/src/164e91a93c2f/liblcthw/src/lcthw/list.c
Shizuka, he's probably got to write a class though, c++ teachers want that for some reason
So Shizuka! You love making music, is there a chance I may get to commission your music for a future game?
13nope
11,02Panda: Okies, maybe tomorrow then ;~;
13i don't compose
All dis code.
What?!

13nope
Y u slap me when you talking to phaes? ;___;
Awww, shame. :(
SB, correction, Shizuka IS code.
Cause I can.
i tried to compose once
13my creativity was successfully hammered out by 13 years of public school
it hurt my ears
I know the feel...

Shizuka, dat feel
How there's a structure in learning...
I still have my creativity though >.>

11,02The structure of learning in US public schools is as follows: Step 1: Were they 1 min late? DISCIPLINE Step 2: Was their homework not in cursive?

NocturnalBlade|Skype: thanks
11,02JRP2234: Me too O3O

lolapple
Ninjazz: Image?

SafariMonkey: looks good
Am I tho only one here who posseses a copy of SURVIVING THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK?
Needs more qusetion mark.
Not mine, just want to know if changes need to be made
question ;_;
Chrysalis: I have over 1200 lines of scripting to make Rhythm is magic.;_;
Vordox, those are unavoidable, but WebAudio should bring those times down to miliseconds
Panda: no
I'll be rigging it
/me hugs Chrysalis, "MINE!"
Phase4: I know... But HTML5 isn't AS3 code.
SafariMonkey, hang on. Loading loading loading loading.
script*
well guys, i'm off to bed ^_^ good night all *hugs the chat*
Vordox, no, but they're close enough that most of your logic could be reused with only syntax changes
Load faster sloth.

NewSuperBronyU: With ponies

Phase4 is that only for mac?
Phase4: What is that?
0_0
Vordox, aparently like the adobe animation tools but designed for use with html5
Starring Nic Cage as Nic Cage.
Phase4: ...Oh...?
11,02This is classic BronyState :3
NewSuperBronyU: What you think of the poster? :D
11,02Vordox: Silleh :3
He is SO talented after all
brony state needs a cage movie night
11,02FALCON PUNCH
11,02d3rb: We actually did one many months ago
:O
Nicolas is so bad arse, he hitswomen
i missed it!
Vordox, i'm fairly sure WebAudio has callbacks for audio, sync your animations to that and it should be easy enough
oh well
11,02We had both The Wickerman and the Vampire movie I believe.
Phase4: Downloading trial atm
that's right boy
smear it all over
I think he likes black paint
wait...
Nic Cage must have a lot of fun
OH MY GOD
Whoa

: D
SB64, you downgraded again :(
NewSuperBronyU
But I'll stop being up in the cloud
11,02:<
Vordox, hence why i was sugesting html5 in the first place, works freking everywhere
Let's test this out
/me glomps Chrysalis ;A;
/me is glomped
So much ponies flipping
11,02lol
Phase4: but it's all about Flash being the "original" where MLP was made in. It was a tribute but...

LAWL SPIKE
PISSED BLOOD!
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
NOT THE BEEES
minecraft. one of the very few places where you will hear. sorry i didn't know swording you in the face you kill you

Vordox, if you can export animations from flash and use them from javascript then its still possible
I want Niclas Cage in MLP!
taoumi and ps2
and most games with friendly fire
Phase4: Flash can export in vectors aye
11,02lol
But I haven't tried it before.
NOOOOO! NOT THE PARASPRITES!
that was me one time in killing floor. i didn't know a shotgu nto the face would kill you
LOL RARITY
NO NOT THE BEEES
Vordox, svg? and the animation paths?
Rarity?! Where?!
Panda: There's no path in these
It's a "pointed" animation, not a moving
dat Panda?
Back in my day we call that a tab fail.
WEll...
That was interesting

imagine someone new entering at this moment
Phase4: no just pinpointing what...well you'd normally hear.. if SB wasn't being silly
Vordox, you COULD export as a png sequence and blit those
you mean like Sellyme just did?
SirGanjalf,  Sellyme (Sellyme@broniesaustralia.com) has joined #bronystate
Phase4: Let's see exports are...

Phase4: Praise to the god of brain to make this work.
the example (spesificly this one https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/gallery/example2.html ) is slow in firefox but there is most certinly room for improvment
NewSuperBronyU: Can I recommend a certain trailer of a game? :P
11,02Sure? o3o

love the batman vs brony where at the end he sing to the song we jus heard

I guess you all have NO idea about the bond of Brony
Her song is a song that "penetrates" and becomes better each time

Oh DAMN Platunim Games! GO GO GO!

Vordox, there isn't, all vectors
Just fine alexxm
Phase4: So I should just put every vector I have in the main window as a instance?

Yay
Lil_B, trololol
Invi, you wise guy :O
i am wise
Moopy: your on yay :)

NENUDJUS: why is your name in all caps? it looks weird :3
Dang... Sesame Street when and got classy
Wise? Pfft, you don't know why chlorophyll is green NENUDJUS :P
I have been here the whole tire time Therainbowvortex
what happened Mutterguy
AdamTheDuck: ....
i just dont fell like im a good person
AdamTheDuck, it is green because it absorps everything but the green color :3
well most of the time
Starflash: it cuz i am wise
Ah, that explains a lot
Invi: lies!!
dude you are a good person
/me licks therainbowvortex
NENUDJUS, my physics teacher is to awesome to lie ^^
/me remembers when it used to be 'one two three four ..ten eleven twelve doo doo doo TWELEVE
Invi: he lies ... to the world!
hey resdint evil is on tv in nz
to .. ME!
so what its a game about that dude
AdamTheDuck Cholophyl contains Iron , Plants need it for the Photosynthesis, Iron is also in our Blood to transport the oxygen, Iron is the Most importand metal for all living things
AdamTheDuck ignore that your name was in there >.<
Lil_B, but isn't iron oxyde red?
Uhh i think carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are pretty important...
Lil_B, copper is green
Invi yes, but nobody said that iron is in the plants in form of oxyde
AND, maybe the green is just the dominand color, have you even seen leafes turn red in the Fall?
hang on a sec i need to recycle my bin on here
there we go
AdamTheDuck: didnt i say that to :P
Lil_B, i thought that had something to do that they already start to ron at the trees
NENUDJUS, too much science :<
*rot
AdamTheDuck: you are just learning my son soon you be wise like i!
Invi no, leafes have multiple colors, it's just that when the Chlorophyl fades away, all the others become more visible
Hey how come Klumzeedragon hasn't been in the chat? its been like weeks from now
what makes Chlorophyl green then
Lil_B, oh okay that makes sense
actually Magnesium is in the centre of Chlorophyll...
mmm
Because science. :<
i knew that
<_<
anypony know any starfox games or what?
god dam i hate my life
starfox 64
:p
that was old game back then
/me gives therainbowvortex a hug
Lil_B, yeah he is right, Mg is in the center and has complex bindings to 2 N and 2 sigma bindings to 2 other N
I know dat feel
mhmm
Moopy Startfox, Starfox 2 , Starfox 64, never played the Gamecube ones
i think i need to go watch ponies now
how about starfox adventures
/me gives therainbowvortex a choclolate fish
therainbowvortex, I was about to suggest that too :P
Invi ok, but I know Iron is in Plants >.<
Lil_B, iron is everywhere :D
o.o
i have iron balls
:3
Invi I mean it plays a major role in plants >.<

I know asn enemie in Concers Bad Fur Day with "Balls of Brass"
Invi: no its just a shel
I am so bloody tired but I do not want to sleep. I don't want to have another dream.
i have just recently railesd that all my so called friends are dicks and couldnt care less whether i live or die
Lil_B, maybe it has something to do with the breathing and the synthese of C6H12O6 (i guess?)
happy thanksgiveing everyone :3

i used to play the nintendo gamecube console my console color was purple just like my controller

Ninjazz: indeed

I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie: are you registered for the newsletter?
I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie, you do PMVs?
o~o
im english half irish and a quarter of italian
not sure
I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie there is no voting, it#s a lottery :)
my great great grandmother was italian i think
Man, voting on a movie would be bad ass though.
Instead of getting our hopes and dreams crushed every single time. :/
but it would require time that no mood here has
then probably not, I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie. in the newsletter is a link where you can propose movies, in the lottery one of them is drawn
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRbVsUTud-0&feature=related >.> not abridge sadly
i wish they maid a mlp fim movie
Aww poor diddums, you need a tissue Ninjazz?
nah too many ponies would vote for star wars or star trek
Annnnnd I'm back
Ponyloverforever, maybe they do
Anything happen?
hola amigo thats all the spainish i know
Alot did.
yeah maybe in the future
Jmo, nah. Never cared too much for the my hopes and dreams anyway.
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
Shame on you.
NENUDJUS, una serveca por favor is mot importante spanish sentence
I don't understand why they show B movies no one likes
I do care about how I smell though.
NENUDJUS, ....well actually not because their beer sucks
It's a lottery.
People pick them.
:P
Except Val.
Ninjazz quit trying to get Twilight to be shown.
people pick the worst quality movie they know
and a movie does not get shown again for about 5 months
Still forgive him for that TERRIBLE TERRIBLE B he showed us that one time.
with justin bieber as rainbow dash
won't*
I_Luv_Pinkie_Pie, you could see the 2-parter as a small movie ^^
fyi, jaymoo, I'm trying for Goldeneye and Stalker (1979) to get shown.
Pfft
You say that, but I know the truth.
twilight...we've never seen this one here. good idea
Ah god damn.
hug ann buddy
My choices in the last two months are rain man and adam's apples
I bet you vote Luna Eclipsed all the tiem, jaymoo. >:T
You bet.
:D
sadly if they did a 90 to 120 minute MLP movie it would most likly be the swan song for this generation of series
I don't even vote.
/me dances

Oh ha.

08,01DoctoDoctorWho: it's Misfits
uhm, I don't. Ionno how big those wings are.
Hey BaconMane! :)
What show is this
You know
so can someone do a run down of the powers that have been reveiled?
but for regular size stuff, I guess a frying pan is enough ^_^
08,01what are we deep frying?
buffalo wings.
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: enough of that lord stuff, please
it would be interesting to have one that has the same curse as Lyra from background pony in there
08,01it's starting to piss me off
'
0,5this guy's creepin'
don't do it man
Where can I put show suggestions
DON'T DO IT
/me finally clings to BaconMane
08,01Starflash|Break: <3
0,5yey cling
08,01MadSurge: i'm also awesome
oi shite
0,5Deep fry yourself
I don't own a deep fryer, which complicates things a bit.
ScootaChicken, what oil were you plannin to use?
Starflash|Break: Dunno, whatever's lying around
olive is kinda expensive for the amount needed to fry in a fryin pan
I was gonna pop in some butter as well
Just for good measure
Oh, don't put in any water though :l
ScootaChicken, put a few bottles of gasoline in the kitchen sink and throw your chicken wings in. Hover a blowtorch above the sink to heat it up BUT DO NOT SET IT ON FIRE. Easy chicken wings
ScootaChicken cooking? I wouldn't trust you with a spoon
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: what... kind of pictures?
I tried that once to increase the amount, and then my wings got soaked
0,5Wait, are these guys in prison?
that's pretty messed up
08,01BaconMane: they're doing community service
0,5Oh
I'm just gonna casually ignore Hat.
0,5I was wondering why they're walking around free
So Starflash|Break, how much oil do you reckon I'll need?
I'm only gonna do like 10 or so
it's so sily and yet so hilarious and interesting
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: okay
0,5lol
http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/4907097 guys seriously this is hilarious
Don't worry, my grandfather did it with an old car battery
holy crap
Scootachicken. Get loads of oil and set it on fire. Then use water to kill the fire
Well, I always manage with a 0.5 - 1 cm layer of oil
hes got a power :o
not as much as you normally use in a deep fryer, I guess
that sounds made up.
Aight
just saying.
0,5The bodies? DId theses guys murser some people??
A guy, yeah
11,01Hi.
Snowflake's upside down mouth
So should I just put some oil into a saucepan, put it on the oven and then put in the chicken wings and wait?
they murdered EVRYPONY
*stove
Nittany_Discord!
Hayo ND
Hi there Nittany_Discord.
Wait a second. Elsie, y u up so early?
U shuldn't be up so early
mornin Nittany_Discord
hi Nittany_Discord
ScootaChicken: can you fit in a spatula in that saucepan? otherwise me thinks it might be a bit impractical :I
0,5Ash im up early cuz

08,01BaconMane: thye did

Starflash|Break: It's about this big: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_MgnxN6QfN9I/TFSbFS1WGgI/AAAAAAAADWg/jsj14hUOw1M/s1600/SUAVE_2_saucepan.jpg so... probably?
What would I need a spatula for?
Flip the snacks? ^_^ you arent literally deep frying them
0,5Ah
0,5How many people did they kill?
2
well
1
1, technically
What's going on in this show
ScootaChicken has the STAINLESS STEEL POT EQUIPED!
Cook +10 ~_~
Ohey, wallet
Starflash|Break: Oh, cool.
Alright, that seems decent enough.
LET'S DO THIS
GL
and tbh
I think it tastes better than deep fried ~_~
and you don't get shitty oil
so that's cool
08,01BaconMane: 1 so far
0,5So how come they say "bodies"?
08,01but he'd killed someone
08,01so there's 2 bodies
0,5oh
y u up so early den, Elsie?
its too cold outside to smoke
I shuld smack u silleh.

there are plenty of RP rooms in Ponychat but this place ain't one

11,01This is not an RP room.

This is a pony room?

Now what?
brb, chat's acting up
Test
.
Hi Doctor!
DoctoDoctorWho is not here right now.
in other news, my cousin was in a wreck a week ago, thankfully she only came out with pain in the leg, no broken bones or anything
I would really love to see a performance in scene of the phantom of the opera
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
cuz i can
oi
twit
:3
dunt do dat
Guys
nuu
yea?
i do wat i wnt
Movies or Plays?
rebaaal
Which is best for you?
Spiderman.mp4-ing it then, Joomay?
never been to a play, but would like to sometime
yap
We need to stream some SPOOKY STUPH!
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
:L
StinkomanFan: are you my mummy?
Not u too, Apok
;A;
Pucker up princess.
Quit being such a wimpo
Just a bloody trout.
I'd actually have prefered Tales from the Crypt, or The Twilight Zone
It's a large trout though
StinkomanFan: where's my mummy
The Twilight Sparkle Zone!
and if you ever get to one it's just something bigger than a simple movie
CrimsonPhoenix I agree, takes more skill to act live
Why does everyone here slap with the large trout? What's wrong with the other fish?
What other fish?
Maybe even Courage the Cowardly Dog, or The Outer Limits
I don't know, cod? Sea bass? Shark? Stingray?
"We control the horizontal."
When mIRC implements another fish, I shall use it.
"We control the vertical"
Till then, large trout will supply my needs.
:>
I used to have a herring and cut trees with it, but then i lost it
Chat you have to decide for me!
Holy shit, I found a mineshaft!
/me pats ASoftFluffyThing
Should I get up and get some Cotton Candy or not?!
ASoftFluffyThing prepared to get lost and resort to digging up
Lil_B, yes. Because you know you want to
Dken2021, I am prepared. and since I'm playing on peaceful mode, NO MOOOOOOOBS!
Lil_B: Yes, do it while stream is off
ASoftFluffyThing hmmm... good... btw. you gonna get lost in there :P
lolol I know
I'm enjoying it alrady.
Level 26, lookin for some redstone
Dem..moooobs.
Ehem
11,01Woke up to pretty intense storms this morning.
11,01Thought I was going to be hit by a tornado.
wow, that bad huh?
11,01Nah. The storms weren't warned. It was a small QLCS. Decent lightning with it, though.
the best day of my life is when I get C&C 3 and find out how to participate in stream against a mod
I know that feel, Nittany_Discord. It's really scary if it's in the midle of the night
I love storms. They're relaxing.
Jmo: same, /)
11,01I did some storm chasing when I was in grad school.
Hoh my god alll this cooooooal and lava
/me is afraid of thunderstorms
Does anyone know how to use the "Bone weight copy" script? The documentation seems lacking.
Nittany_Discord! Stream some SCARY STUPH!
Sorry wrong channel again
Tsk tsk
11,01Someone else is trying to set up a stream.
Gold!
Is it horror? :3
lolgold
I aspire to one day challenge Wrek to a dual in Tiberium wars, our battle will be legendary!
/me kidnPA JMO
DoctoDoctorWho I think he said he didn't like C&C 3 that much
The hell did I do?
what do you mean
It's a wrek stream? Aw, no scary stuff :(
You don't steal a person without reason or purpose.
Jmo i do it because it amuses me
YOU WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD A CAR
if that amuses you, then that worries me.
killerpony7733: do you know any other mods that play the game?
StinkomanFan: would if i could
DoctoDoctorWho Our + type mod DWR plays it. I played atleast once with DWR else i do not
Downloading a car wouldn't be possible, tis too big of a file. D:
I wouldn't say that for sure http://derpy.me/vhr0n
Pfft

Not a real car.

Browniestate is a srs bsns place alex
Just do an allban and be done with it
DashWithRainbows: I have reason to belive that you are an adequite RTS gamer?
I love C&C.
eh
So that is a yes.
DashWithRainbows Yeah you are pretty good you certainly do alot more them me in a match. But that's maybe cause i keep stuff to a minimal and slowly build up things
which C&C we talking about?
Apple_jack C&C 3
Oh, I like to rush as scrin
GDi I take my sweet ass time
What an ass.
DashWithRainbows Well that's what how ti goes GDI=slow bot god damn powerful scrin=rush and rush NOD=stealth and sneaky~

And thusly I had Cotton Candy :$
DashWithRainbows: very well, as soon as it is within my ability to do so, I, DoctoDoctorWho, challenge you, DashWithRainbows, to a dual of C&C3 legendrieness!!
lol dual

Legendariness
DoctoDoctorWho Could play a 3v3 with me and DWR against 3 bots
^
I enjoy Turtle AI a lot.
Test how well you're good at attacking defenses
You're horrible dwr.
<3
DashWithRainbows: The mountain stands firm and yeilds to no aggressor- turtle creed
Defence f*** yeah
DashWithRainbows Yep but one superweapon and master a cluster of energy plants usually takes care of that to allow me to rush
a mass cluster*
Hello everypony!
Hola senor
...Did the chatroom just derped?
Be warned, even though I play defencive, I am well versed in the art of airstrike
defensive*
wait... that's kinda pointless, I'll just be back later
...Sooo, you're a karate master.
I'm fine with that.
DashWithRainbows: so fav faction? playstyle?
I enjoy GDI, I like to support my teammates by building defences for them
DWR supporting
HAH
Yep.

ALWAYS!
so i saw the cabin in the woods last night
You've said that 4 times >.>
heh ok
Is it good anyways?
yeah i liked it it was sort of like an SCP foundation movie
DashWithRainbows: A turtle vs turtle, I usually curbstomp all the AI's once my armies get up to full steam so it'll be nice to see which turtle stands strong in the face of the opposing warmachine
hm
Well, if I'm fighting AI, I either steamroll or rush for resources.
SCP the movie sounds... pretty cool actuallu
Evenmoreso if it's directed by Ed Wood or his modern day equivilent
hey everpony ;)
DashWithRainbows: so when I do get the game, how would I join a stream session? is there a special room in online play that I can join or something?

dfv0\
what are we watching
Look at how many times it cuts to a guy just blankly staring without even speaking, or how often the person speaking isn't moving in ANY other way. Not so much as a blink or twitch.
ZOMG! they need to make a fallout 3 anime!
OH EM GEE
The characters are so lifeless and freaky. ._.
DaringDerpy: ALL OF MY MONEY! ALL OF MY GODDAMN MONEY!
DaringDerpy: WHERE CAN I BUY IT?
00,10they wrote the name of the portal gun wrong on the box
CriticKitten: Animation is HARD
:>
DaringDerpy: YEAH, WHERE?!
05ohai
they cost circa $150 per piece. for making blue light and portal sounds. toys r us has them
Reactor: Too hard to bother with basic human functions? Then maybe they shouldn't draw humans. :p
Sumica: ...It's...fake?
ohai Wrek
Sumica: uhmm nope the name is correct
CriticKitten: I agree
hi Wrek
its atlas ASHPD
OH FUCK IT'S ZOMBIE HEATH LEDGER
00,10hai wrek
SPEAKING of that, has Equestrian Innovations released anything new yet?
Well...it looks real to me, it even has the Valve Logo....
^
00,10i know it's real but they did't use the full name of the gun
08,01wheeeee
but i thought ASHPD was the fulll name
Well, we know that's it real, BUT...
cachi01: I thought so too.
Can it fire portals?
VenHur: will it blend? that is the question
Wrek Gonna play PS2 later tonight?
http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13164765 it's real
cachi01: (insert a catchy little tune)
and of course it can fire portals
00,10guess that is the offical name
05not as much as yesterday. got a meetign at 8 tomorrow
Bulma?
00,10could have swarn they never said portal in the name in the first game
See? Look how often there's only ONE thing moving on the screen at a time. One guy turns his head, one mouth moving, everything else is totally still. Or at times, there's nothing moving at all. It's incredibly freaky.
DaringDerpy: i already know what i want for my bday besides the OUYA
hehe
0,5Well i honestly prefer someone not just walk in after seeing the channel name in a video
But can it fire portals? I'm skeptic...
ohai Wrek
0,5Nothing personal, it's just how it's usually been.
Omg, two things moving at once, don't have a seizure there animators. XD
If it can, then ALL OF MY MONEY, VALVE!
hope you have fun with it, cachi01 :)
i will :3
Well ok then. If you want me to leave just kindly say so and I won't come back
Aww...it's just an action figure replica...
Ponies47: just stay xd
What we watching?
DerpyMuffins: Ghost in the Shell.
Ghost in the shell
cachi01: You did the same thing as me
yep
:3
damn it
CriticKitten: :D
00,10that guys face is so freaky
but i already had the ide of the room's name
idea*
Still, I take the portal gun, even if it just an action figure, and that i'm too old for toys.
thelonepony: :3
This is kinda creepy
yeah....messed up face guy doesnt sit with me right....
Well, mind you, i'm still young at heart!
Did a bobcat run over that guy's face?
"Oh, don't mind how I look. I just got into a knife fight with Commander Shepard."
growing up is fro pussies!
Woah woah woah back the fuck up
00,10You have to grow old but you dont have to grow up
Incidentally, making an abridged series of this show should be easy. The lip-flapping is done for you
Why the fuck are there new people in here
ELSIE
WAT R U DOING
0,5Not my fault o/
ELSIE
STAHP
Im stil an 8 year old at heart
It is all your fault bro
Sumica: wise words
0,5ok yes my fault
0,5but whatevs
You got Sumi to stream them vidyas.
So is my grammar
00,10any animation can say the same CriticKitten
she didnt blink through that whole speech segment....
'tis true. But it's especially easy here, where there aren't other actions accompanying the lip-flaps.
That face is so creepy
Usually you have to snip a segment short to avoid showing the character doing things. Here? Just let it ride. :P
Oh, hey, a new low score. Brilliant. -.-;
Now I think they're just trolling me, scoring low on their tests on purpose just to make me feel bad.
0,5bleh
ScootaChicken: cause why dafuq not
IT VIOLATES THE STATUS QUO ASFJAJCAJFOJ
00,10be worried when they start scoreing in the negitive.
ha
0,5Newfags r worstfags
I'm already worried, because I'm grading Calc tests and they're making Algebra mistakes

Eeyup....messed up face guy is our trade show dick.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!?
I have no words on how much I despise this event.
00,10he is a dickhead in both action and well the general shape of it
oh, ok, CCCP

You had to go there Sumica?
CCCP: :D Turretshy?

00,10Shizuka~
No.
Okay
See? Only one movement at once.
Shizuka: Thats the butter up before news food.
bad news*
I usually use the word "You".
ohai Shizu
It's just making my head explode, that's all
hi Shizuka :)
You can blame Joomay for why I speak like that.
hi Shizuka
"Features: Long Face" I feel a pun coming up
Apokalipse Welp, don't read my messages when talking to Joomay.
Mister Roger?
You'll lose braincells.
"PENISMAN MCASSHAT IS STILL ON THE LOOSE."
hi Shizuka

One guy that refuses to use cyborg implants to make his face better? CAN'T SEE WHY >_>

ello
Hold the camera still and minimize the animation, animators. Don't want to drive costs up too high.
hi bluemane
Hey bluemane!
...would it make me feel as if I sniffed paint?
The freaky guy dies right?
That also makes you lose brain cells
...err, or so I hear
how are things bluemane
Like a horrible death?
00,10save teh budget for the action
Problem?
but it smells so good
00,10why break the budget in exposision
00,10when we can do it in explosions
I don't know.
Hey! MadSurge and thelonpony alexxm|colt! things are good thx hbu?
Ask Bronysith.
amen!
He seems to have sniffed a lot of paint as a child.
"Here's a slide show from my vacation."
Sumica: Which is fine, except when 90% of the show is exposition.
I don't want to he's Bronysith
I think you mean paint thinner though.
bluemane: They're good, yeah :)
i'm good bluemane
I love the show, but it's still pretty jarring in retrospect. :P
CYBERJESUS
00,10lawl
thats good CriticKitten
Well it is more vaporous
I didn't know Jesus was a fan of Daft Punk
(not sure if that is spelled correctly or not)
ARGH lag again
Lot of hanging on my end.

Either that or the Chief is dramatically pausing for effect.

Sumica: deoesnt matter if you cant even hit the target due to drop
00,10purples tanks cant rotate the gun

Mind you, this isn't a vote. I was just vocalizing my desire between the two.
As long as it's a hermit and not a headcrab...
ya
Ninjazz, what is the difference?
headcrabs are adorable!
13mind you i only have the first two bayformers
Invi, it's not official! \o/
13they did the third but i don't have it
my friend has a headcrab hat
It's okay Shizu,
The third is awful anyways. More awful than the norm.
:P
just look at their cute belly <3 http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100116143162/half-life/en/images/4/49/Headcrab_underbelly.jpg
I hope they riff The Avengers
I pissed off one of my friends when I predicted the movie's ending about halfway into it.
or The Dark Knight Rises
what is bayformer?
What was the third about again?
headcrabs :3 http://derpibooru.org/12740?scope=scpee797e8c7c16183d62da95919900ca5c09c6b09e0

13curse you text for not being able to convey notes
as a dedicated [portal fan with over ten objects of portal related things (and i'm werign my portal shirt right now) i am obligated to get this replica
Invi, not to my knowledge. That shiny + only means he makes important announcements.
Ninjazz, oh wait, he was the technician or kinda like that
13phase is our cache guru
I'd have a stream for going up, and a stream for going down, and a third stream just for shoooooooowwww
Techie eyup.

Shizu: I know that song. Not sure if good or bad. ._.
Oh so he's the got to guy for when the site drops?
cool
13not really, it's managed by cloudflare so drops are generally derps on their end

http://derpy.me/yQPEO
Shizuka: I belive the origional is "yiddle diddle diddle diddle diddle die" or something
Oh. But he manages the site while it's under heavy load?
does that make otakon bronystate mascot shizu ?

ASoftFluffyThing dunno, left for 15 seconds and come back to a Molestia link
http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/21071243975
Lunar_Brony, well it is Sunday.
08,01okay, enough molestia for now

FISH. y u so goddamn smelly. ;__;
I got away with it. Zing.
Grrrr jaymoo.
11,01Panda|Drawing: Might want to draw that soon. Seriously considering joining the Air Force soon, so I won't be around for a while.
iwubu
. . .
Whoa nice Nitt.

holy mother of i don't understand that sentence
11,01Yeah. Got a master's in meteorology. Going to see if I can get into Officer's School and become and Weather Officer.
Nice use of punctuation there.
...What.
TL;DR
11,012nd Lieutenant Nittany_Discord.
whatever you say 2md Lieutenant Nittany_Discord
*2nd
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
NO YOU WERE TOO LATE.
Weather Officer? That's an actual rank?
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
2d lieutenant Maid_cord in the war againt dust
Nittany_Discord D: dood thats awesome!
/me puts DashWithRainbows in a locked room with molestia
wait what?
2nd Lieutenant that sounds so awesome lol
Yeah, no.
Ninjazz, no, its a job
Ninjazz yeah, who else is going to be in charge of checking the weather systems?
hugs Jmo
In the Air Force, though? o_O
Ninjazz this is the Air Force he's talking about
basically a weather officer is the weatherman for the air force
Also, Sith, you'll need to put a capital letter when writing a name.
Nittany_Discord, when are you gonna go in for evaluation?
( '__') I still don't get it.
ew hugs, so touchy touchy.
Learn 2 inglish.
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout

hu wood want 2 touch him?
11,01Don't know Panda|Drawing.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT nu
Ninjazz the Air Force is in charge of all the planes and other flying shit. Do you think it would be a good idea to have a multi-million dollar aircraft fly out into unknown weather conditions?
/me slaps trout around with large jmo
The only thing jaymoo likes touching is a large trout. He keeps it in his grip at all times.
Ninjazz knows it.
So very well.
Too well. ( ;__;)

Nittany_Discord, 50? How were you able to focus that long?
Ninjazz I'm just taking an educated guess at this. I live up north, if you recall my 1st alias.
11,01Formed a plan.
Hey Kawaii_icybeauti.

11,01It was fun actually.
o_O
Nittany_Discord ^^ well I'm happy for you :3
11,01Listened to music while I did it.
sounds like me writing a fan-fic
or three
And still focused?!
11,01Focusing was a challenge.
11,01And being overwhelmed was as well.
I listen to music when I have to work. It makes it easier.
Dayum right. Especailly with music playing.
Off to bed I go, woop.

Cooking dinner, brb
11,01Back when Maid Hour was popular.
before the fire nation attacked
Back then. :/
11,01Before the RP nation attacked.
we ALL know what happened to Maid Hour, though
11,01I canned it.
Nittany_Discord: Heh, good times.
11,01Silently.
And painfully.
When we had to write essays in social studies, my teacher wrote "their" and "there" on the board. I was going to tell her to write "they're" also, but I was too lazy
Invi don't know "Well... there was something we should have done already" I don't know what, maybe a long big routine check
Nittany hung up his duster in silence.
. . .
I miss being dusted with a brick :(
Invi btw. I'm currently upü again with my search for a name >.<
Dusting was funnn
11,01Yeah, but it can get awkward.
I was only in it for the wax.
Well... the RP Guys went somewhere were Maid Hour is 24h
I let you all have your dust.
Lil_B, COUGH COUGH.
true
Ninjazz yyerp, exactly
Lil_B hehe good riddance?
COUGH COUGH COUGH.
WHAT
11,01Yeah. Everyone including me was starting to take maid hour too far to where it was 3 and 4 hrs.
Ninjazz what do you want?
Panda|Drawing help me, whats riddence? I don't know what that means :/
/me gives Ninjazz some coughing medicine
I want a damn sandwich, Lunar_Brony.
Sorry everypony, I missed Friday movie night :P
/me gives Ninjazz, dammmit Invi
Ninjazz: *sandvich
I an't no heavy.
Panda|Drawing, :D
Ninjazz is heavy
Ninjazz too bad, BerryPunch isn't active. Besides, you need to be a mod for her to call you silly for making an invalid request.
silly
Ninjazz, how heavy are yu? ^^
230 lbs. Hah Murikan system.
140 pounds
People keep mistaking me for a football playinger. >_<
11,01Wow. I'm only 206.
Ninjazz use Metrics!
NEVER!
70kg, that's normal
MWAHAHAHAHA.
I'm lighter than you all
11,01I used to be 230 when I graduated high school. Never again.
Serenity, how do you know?
because he's a conformist. Real hipsters sue customary.
54 kg with a BMI of 19.4
use*
Serenity, then you are smaller though ^^
I'm always between 70 and 80 somewhere
kg that is
Invi: Only 5"2'
I don't use metrics for weight, unless I'm doing scientific calculations in which grams is standard.
11,01Going to the Air Force will get my BMI to ideal instead of over.
/me used to be 250 before he started skating >.>
Serenity, that doesn't tell me athing cuz I'm not 'murican ^^
11,01I started walking and running one or twice a day.
I'm not either!!!
11,01And I eat less.
How dare you
Air Force doesn't require much physical training though, right?
I cheerlead. It's literally the only sport I can do.
Also, that's the standard way of measureing someone
11,01Don't know.
5 foot 2 inches.
Serenity, it is? never heard of it
I'm about 5ish
You'll probably spending more time in air craft than on the ground, so probably.
Ninjazz depends, probably. You need to be fit if immediate evacuation is required
Also, doesn't help that I'm thin as hell
You europeans and your metric system......
Kawaii_icybeauti hey, we use metric up north too
Lunar_Brony, well, THAT yes. Can't be physically inapt in the the armed forces and what not.
atleast, we're supposed to
Lunar_Brony: Sorry, canadians too. And happy thanksgiving to you!
Kawaii_icybeauti thank you! I completely forgot about my awesome long weekend.
I can sleep in tomorrow!
me can'tz
5am.
XD
I should think about bed soon.
Lunar_Brony: I'm getting it a little later on. My social studies teacher actually left school because she's canadian and went to celebrate. We have columbus day tomorrow, so I can sleep in too!
yeah . . .
Ninjazz, soon as in 12h? :D
Hi AJIsAwesome|Asleep "Can't hear ya, I'm asleep"?

Also, I've defeated joomay.

Anyways, I'm stalling and I haven't even gone outside today. GigabitHarmonie, I'll probably speak to you after my walk or something, I don't know.

Silver_Soother: sometimes, he doesn't have a real schedule
As for everyone else, hope you enjoy the tunes.

Welcome back Dark92Enigma!
wb Dark92Enigma
lawl, cloud dressed as a girl :D
lol, my brother can barely fit my old long sleeves
so, how you're doing?
Pretty good. How about yourself? :)
ohai Dark92Enigma
i'm good Dark92Enigma you
Dark92Enigma: good :)
wb Dark92Enigma :)
well i can't run Ravaged
Dark92Enigma: good right now :)
Dark92Enigma: I got a splinter in my foot
Hey Dark92Enigma
Bunny_Striker: Ouch.
well, i'm at my parent's house, taking care of everything while they're asleep..........had a great Movie night yesterday
Bunny_Striker: awwwwwwww
despite the bad B movie
that's why i enjoyed it
It was bad, but not WMC bad. :D
I didn't hate the B Movie as much as I probably should've.
WMC?
Bunny_Striker: my cousin had the same trouble
Worst Movie Clause.
ohh
AJIsAwesome: It's not a TERRIBLE movie, but down right dissapointing
Dark92Enigma: Pretty much.
It got a Wine Spritzers/10 for me.
I generally focus all of my capacity for hate for the truely evil things that threaten all the good things in this world.
I love B movies, they make me laugh
at how crappy thet are
Kandarihu: Same here.
it had some buildup, fantastic animation but that's the only redeeming things about it........Oh, the Villain is pretty good, but had LITTLE TO NO SCREENTIME
Bunny_Striker: I'm gonna take on B movies like that
Oh yeah. This is the raciest thing that 4Kids ever put out. References to alcohol and death are heard in it. And there's even multicolor STROBING.
Like VENOM, Darth Maul, and............any villain
Did the IRC explode with ZUUL during the A movie?
yep. :D
Kandarihu: EEEEEEEEEEEEYUP
hello :3
Hello, sonicandmario85. :)
ohai sonicandmario85

Bunny_Striker: btw, the next B MOVIE Is PPG

you know those baby chickens i was talking about? well yesterday we bought some baby ducks and put them in there with the baby chickens
Dark92Enigma: omg
sonicandmario85: Did they end up bonding?
Kandarihu, you did? Sorry about that
ASoftFluffyThing, no trouble
AJIsAwesome:whats that?
Kandarihu: Not to mention, in that (Yu-Gi-Oh) movie, THEY NEVER SHUT UP
+k
i come in and there's a party goin' on right here
sonicandmario85: Basically what I mean is, did they get along fine? :)
Hi, taoumi. Welcome to the party! :)
Dark92Enigma, that's normal for this series.
AJIsAwesome:yes but the red chickens were being little assholes pecking them
taoumi: when its time to party we will always party hard!
ohai taoumi
AJIsAwesome:they stopped though
Okay. :)

Thanks, GigabitHarmonie. :)

I did enjoy it, but I think I'm getting desensitized to the funk.
Thanks GBH.
thanks GigabitHarmonie for the stream
aw geegabeet dunt leave
thanks GigabitHarmonie for the tunes :)
Oop. Never mind. I guess I'm not.
Thanks for the tunes and stream, GigabitHarmonie
Kandarihu: Yes, it is......but although it's supossed to be a movie, it left me dissapointed because the pacing is the same (i don't know if the japanese version is better, but i guess it is)
Thanks GigabitHarmonie !
brb
I'm not sure about the pacing or the silence, but in the original TV series, the music is better. But that should go without saying.
thx GigabitHarmonie :)
Er, original as opposed to the dub.
:)
AJIsAwesome:also the red ones are responsible for killing one of the chickens because they kept pecking it those red ones were pecking everyone in the eye now we have 12 of them
sonicandmario85: Aw, man. That sucks. :(
the one that died was a younger one then them
it might have been from it being cold in there so we put a blanket on the cage now its warm in there
No it isn't
>_> <_<

I was late to the party

08,01i still have it lying around somewhere
the footsteps are kinda annoying....
http://www.lolxpix.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/5338.jpg
In this section, the buddha took an arrow to the knee <_< >_>
08,01when i was a teenager, i used to buy lots of computer magazines
Sly: it's an old game, get used to it
this made me laugh a bit
then i felt bad.
yo Lyra` it looks fake :(
/me never had a demo CD
cowvakian sorry if i upset you, fine sir
08,01i've got a full set of PC Pro, PC Zone, and Personal Computer World from about 1998 to 2004
/me always pirates
Sly: you didn't I was just saying
08,01in fact, the PC Pro is 1998 - 2006, i think
Alright, who guessed the Bolero of Fire? because here we are
08,01and some of the PC Zone and PC Formats are 1996 - 1998
probably is.
cowvarkian alright
StinkomanFan: MEEEE
00,10so what is the point of this?
13you'll see
Sumica: theres a point?
13the overall point is we have to melt the butter statue of the black buddha
Sumica to burn your eyes
There's always a point.
so was this game any good
13to do that, we block certain tunnels to direct heat
You get a cookie. It is old and crumbly and all the chocolate chips fell out.
08,01this kinda reminds me of Myst and The Daedalus Encounter
00,10ah ok
Shizuka: I thought it was to mindlessly solve puzzles, and find a useless pyramid
Fun fact, Presto Studios produced Exile.
13yep they did exile
13which i can't play for stream :<
heloo

CriticKitten I also really miss playing infuse
/me already likes this song because of the title XD
lmao
If only all drummers were as enthusiastic as this one.
Arcane: GvG? Bah. Lamesauce on rye. People love to brag about GW1's PvP system, but honestly it was really really bad. >_> The fact that they had to constantly rebalance every single profession and so many skills, and yet it's STILL broken makes that rather clear.
This song, it shall be my theme when my beard gets as bushy as the singers
/me sings smile smile smile

THIS is going in my playlist! :D

/me dances with Ponies47
stop looking at me
is Shizuka still streaming?
Arcane: And honestly? The PvP was probably the one thing GW1 could hold over GW2, simply because of how limited the PvP is.
CriticKitten I loved GvG so much, Most orignal PvP system to date. My guild and I win nearly every tourny on FA server It feels really weak now
?
Polydunami: Indeed
mmmmm i think i should have sex with a bearded woman
is it that rare?
yes
cachi01: lmao
weegee2062: hmm
Star swirl the bearded
that was awesome

Arcane: The problem is, it's not very good. It's horrendously unbalanced.
and then buffer
Oh my, it's a pony
GW2? Oh yes its bad
Arcane: Original, fair enough. Fun, maybe. Balanced? Not at all.
dat t-shirt
brush your mane bro
It's MIDNIGHT :D
Arcane: I didn't even bother with most of GW1's PvP because of how atrociously unbalanced it is. >_>

So guys, Pokemon B/W 2 came out today. 3 Badges so far.

it's nice
Who is this guy on my screen

00,10for being such a great OS linix sure seems alot like dos
it's a time machine

This is the opposite of a thunderstorm: the thunder comes BEFORE the lightning

08,01well, for most things

Sooooo which is Daring Do carrying?

It's not that hard to make it clear to whoever's reading what you mean.
If you can't do that, then you're a terrible writer

...IS DARING DO CARRYING A FLAMING STICK OR A FLASHLIGHT?!
what are we watching?
StinkomanFan: yes
So you name all of a thing after a function that only some of the thing have?
a flashstick
a flaming flashlight
a flaming light and a flashstick
And YOU name everything after something that is based on a flame and not incandescence or fluourescence or diode radiation?
ok dafuq is happening
fffffs
cachi01: we're arguing about arbitrary names
00,10early models did indeed flash.
yes
cowvarkian: i mean in the stream
We're trying to figure out WTH Daring Do is carrying
00,10some sill have the breaker on them to cause them to flash
called*
cachi01: misfits, british TV show
English definition would include flashlight as a secondary meaning.
cowvarkian: YEAH I KNOW but the were suddenly pawnching that guy while bowling
Installing Skype woot woot
Imagine "Heroes" but British and everyone's an Asshat
/me sit.
Kurra: what, reason with dumbass murricans?
Lawl
No, it isn't.
twilight_sprinkle, come again?
Dovah: nope
not That vastly
Dovah: thats like saying Latin spanish is the same as Spain Spanish
call the money police
God Canterlot Gardens was so much fun
00,10just tell dari you could care less about his english.
I loved every minute of it
00,10then call him a welshman
lol
Sumica: a sodding welshman?
Touche.
:P
08,01what do they call a sheep tied to a lamppost in Wales?
You guys are never going to stop me from complaining about it though
Kurra: i thought thats what you were trying to say
08,01a leisure centre
oh god i'm sick that shene was not good for me
08,01sorry for the pause, i couldn't remember how to spell "leisure"
But I wouldn't still be me if I didn't try.
but soccer is real football
u damn murricans stole the name!
cachi01: well obviously
knife
http://www.thefreedictionary.com/torch http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flashlight according to that a "torch is not reffered to as a flashlight but a flashlight can be reffered to as a torch.
Kurra: we did everything wrong
Kurra must be new here
people are really !#@$ed up these days
08,01i once asked a Welshman if it was true that they shoved the sheep's back feet into their wellies to stop them getting away
Nevermind, i scrolled down :P
its clarity vs old tradition of words. i go for clarity
08,01he looked at me aghast, and said "of course not! then how would we kiss 'em?"
00,10i agree with the football thought, i think hand egg is funny.
hand egg XD
hand egg LOLXD
hand egg would be fine with me if thats what they called it :D
window
still, murrican footbal is actually somewhat interesting, has quite a bit of strategy to it
^
00,10why do scots wear kilt's. Cause sheep can hear a zipper 3 miles away.
twilight_sprinkle: its pretty boring
08,01cowvarkian: i'm just being an assbutt
EXTERMINATE
08,01ha!
twilight_sprinkle: strategy?
Sumica: :D
hah
08,01i'd not heard that one!
twilight_sprinkle: football is more fun to play
twilight_sprinkle: murrican football is plain boring
cachi01: when i saw it, i thought it was quite interesting to watch. as for football, i dont like it, imo its boring and half the matches end in 0-0
give me 1000000000000$
cowvarkian: yes, strategy.
da wubs
twilight_sprinkle: whatever you say, george.
twilight_sprinkle: yeah im not a fan of football either. but its more fun to play soccer than playing hand egg
00,10US football was silly a few weeks back when they had to use replacment ref's cause the real ones were on strike
cachi01: lolwut hand egg
cachi01: again, not for me
i want handeggs
cachi01: both are dangerous to play too
cachi01: i got kicked in the nuts so many times in high school football..
*shivers*
My friends are Packers fans and they would not shut the hell up >.> I do agree that the whole fiasco is ridiculous though
pff she puked...
twilight_sprinkle: which is why I don't play sports
i never puke from throwing up
eat the money
cowvarkian: i play tennis, tis a good sport
twilight_sprinkle: hah, tennis a sport
dead
rape
she OD
cowvarkian: ouch. now that just hurts
cowvarkian: now thats just dumb.
What do you guys think of rugby then?
Eli: well, its a sport as much as table tennis is a sport, and I consider it to be one, so yes, it is a sport
dont they know that theyre supposed to leave them face down?
ive never seen a rugby match
death by vomit
cowvarkian: you have obviously never played real tennis then
00,10never watched enough Rugby to figure out the rules
Eli: Not very well
i have the ball hit me in the head
00,10most games look like a moshpit
twilight_sprinkle is right
cowvarkian: and fuck it's exshaustin
twilight_sprinkle: didn't I convey the message that I actually think that tennis is a sport
Rugby has some weird rules, you get the feeling that the players don't know half of them
The main one is just don't pass backwards.
That's pretty much all you need to know
XD
twilight_sprinkle: heh... ok
um...k
those were some weird shoes
00,10so it's ice hocky minus the ice and sticks
wanker realy
cowvarkian: now you're just trollin... human rights are usually in the rules included
Hah, I guess so Sumica
Eli: its rugby though...
cowvarkian: -.(\
Eli: Yes, I know
00,10I used to be in to hocky till they cancled it for like 3 years due to a strike
well, this is amusing me quite well...
.
,
oni_link did the other pokemon player leave?
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them
Arcane: i dont think so
oen ring to umm.. make muffins
KK bb
It would have been fine except they stopped every 2 minutes
i ate it
00,10they have to leave time for advertisments
Might have been because it was the Superbowl, but they played 2 minutes, then talked for 2 minutes at the previous 2 minutes
I think baseball is the most boring sport to watch
golf
taake another car
oni_link: I think that ice skating is the most
that was my second choice twilight_sprinkle
cowvarkian: I dont even consider that a sport >.>
oni_link: I don't either
DRUGS:O
cowvarkian: /)
Well ice skating is more in lin with something like gymnastics
line*
yup dari, my point exactly
oni_link: (/
what
WHAt
weegee2062: magic
wut
what show is on the stream?
Misfits
that
Whats it about?
Starlight_Phoenix: super powers fucking up peoples lives
like heroes?
do you belive in magic in a young girls heart
Starlight_Phoenix: only much more dark
well, sortof
Much more dark?
weegee2062: D:
Ehh
the characters are just dicks
tbh
I'd say they're just different styles
00,10how do you get more dark then cuting peoples heads off to get there powers?
This is more 'real life' people with super powers, somehow.
That's how I see it anyway
Sumica: meh, different styles
00,10so heros with out genre savvy
Sumica: dark isnt always gore though
this still british heroes?
we should watch Rocknrolla
00,10we already have
Sumica: maybe instead of more dark, just "everyones an asshat"
08,01btw
so he has the power of hindsight?
Starlight_Phoenix: basicly
00,10rocknrolla was wreks pick for the birthday specal thing we did for luna and him
both :D
