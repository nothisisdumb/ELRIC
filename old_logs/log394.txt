<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<Pinkieruler124> Ok then.....
<Pinkieruler124> What's it called
<Sumica> 00,10and it kinda resembles masseffect in a way.
<Sumica> 00,10M4
*Jim is away for a while
<Pinkieruler124> M4 ok...
<CountDoofus> I've got a dilemma... should I get ME3 on the day it comes out, or get it for free at the end of the month by subscribing to a games magazine?
<ekips> still don't know if I'm getting mass effect 3
<OtakuTom> I didn't like the original ME, so I haven't even played 2 yet, despite having it.
<Dark_Horst> CountDoofus: gt it for free by pirating
<CountDoofus> not everyone is a pirate, Horst
<Pinkieruler124> Count is here?
<Dark_Horst> there's always a first time for everything
<CountDoofus> ... no. *spy cloak*
<RainbowPredator> shouldent the lightsabers destroy the instruments?
<Pinkieruler124> I See you!
<Dark_Horst> ME3 will be distributed via origin. that alone is reason enough to tell ea to fuck themselves
<OtakuTom> Okay...why haven't I seen this before...I love it!
<pony_7733> horst while i can agree its shit and a failed attempt to be steam
<pony_7733> i can accept to use it for certain games
<Pinkieruler124> Hi pony
<OtakuTom> Same here, 7733
<RainbowPredator> LOL
<ofna01> darth vader
<ekips> I think I'll wait a while to see if it is worth, buy the game and then pirate it so I do not have to use origin
<RainbowPredator> epic vader
<pony_7733> pirating doesnt help PC gaming ekips
<OtakuTom> If I get ME3, I'll get it for the 360, since that's what I've got 1 and 2 for.
<ekips> pony_7733 i repeat "buy the game and then pirate it"
<Iwubponiez> well
<pony_7733> oh lol
<Pinkieruler124> LLLLLLLOOOOOOOLLLLOLOLlolooOLOLOLO LOL!
<CountDoofus> I don't think EA, I think Bioware. plus I'm getting it for XBox, so I can't pirate it even if I wanted to
<ekips> that way I support bioware but don't have to use origin
<RainbowPredator> tha chewbacca
<Iwubponiez> i love this vid
<pony_7733> ekips
<Dark_Horst> yes you can
<pony_7733> you support EA by buying a copy anyway
<Iwubponiez> XD
<Dark_Horst> you can download xbox games too, you know?
<pony_7733> since publishers get a deal of the money
<Lunarletic> this vs shamisen bros
<Iwubponiez> @_@ must obey
<Lunarletic> lol
<OtakuTom> That's what ekips is saying, 7733. Buying it supports ea, but the pirating of it allows him to bypass origin.
<Iwubponiez> huh what's that
<Pinkieruler124> Maybe derpy has a twin....
<Pinkieruler124> THE BUCK!?
<pony_7733> I guess its a somewhat validpoint
<pony_7733> valid point*
<Saturn> 08,01AAARGH
<CountDoofus> piracy is a crime. I'd rather not risk a criminal record, ever
<Gunthler> oh god this song
<RainbowJack> who is streaming?
<Dark_Horst> i learned my shit with BF3. EA isn't worth my money, so they won't get it anymore
<Gunthler> Way to finish off my class
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, *fuck* one of my lecturers.
<OtakuTom> Personally, I'm with you on that, Count.
<Saturn> 08,01he insists on calling me "andy"
<ekips> anyway, I'll just wait if the game is worth the price
<pony_7733> BF3 is alright but it wasnt any previous BF game
<RainbowPredator> heyheyhey
<Saturn> 08,01and has sent a document for an event i'm helping out with, with my name as "Andy Bell"
<pony_7733> has some stuff the old games would benefit from
<Saturn> 08,01i *HATE* people calling me Andy
<Saturn> 08,01i hate it so much
<Lunarletic> lol
<Saturn> 08,01my name... is *Andrew*
<Pinkieruler124> Ok...
<Saturn> 08,01it's not hard, stupid fuck face lecturer...
<Saturn> 08,01sorry, i'll calm down
<Pinkieruler124> Mine is christina
<ekips> iknowthatfeel saturn
<RainbowcrashNBurn> god dangit....i go downstairs to scan my latest drawing and miss the awesome song
<RainbowPredator> that happend to my friend to
<Jim> dat warning
<Dark_Horst> i'm not complaining about BF3 itself. it's an awesome game. i'm complaining about software that openly told me it could to whatever the fuck it wants and the absolutely STILL not working webbrowser based server lobby
<ekips> some of my teachers keep calling me Daniel (my brother's name) >.<
<Saturn> 08,01it's one of the only things that gets me really riled up
<Pinkieruler124> ok...
<pony_7733> oh yes
<Capn_fisty> I dont really care what people call me as log as i know its me they mean
<Saturn> 08,01ekips: i got that at school, but mainly because i'm a twin
<pony_7733> the just silly and dumb server browser
<Pinkieruler124> what is this?
<Gunthler> Alright everypony, i need to go. See ya later
<Saturn> 08,01that said, my brother and i don't look anything alike

<Saturn> 08,01urgh, atupid watch, doesn't realise that today is leap-day...

<Snuffsis> It's not hard to dance, just wave your hands like you don't care. That's what everyone else does. :P
<Snuffsis> And if you're white you can always blame it on that.
<Dashie_Dashie> ahaha! BHG, I love you Snuffsis /)

<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FtzaDxHgLk
<ekips> can't listen to any songs now, I'm caught in the Heroes VI soundtrack >.<
<Dashie_Dashie> I don't know why but 70% of the bands I listen too come from the UK.
<Dashie_Dashie> their always pure awesomeness.
<CountDoofus> Coldplay?
<Dashie_Dashie> nein.
<CountDoofus> pah.
<KwakLad-> Pink Floyd?
<Dashie_Dashie> aye
<Snuffsis> Haven't heard that one Dashie.
<KwakLad-> Good
<Jim> Pink Floyd is one awesome band
<KwakLad-> Is hawkwind British I can't remember?
<Snuffsis> I listened to these all the time back in the day, when they were actually good. :D
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4
<CountDoofus> and when exactly did LP go bad?
<Snuffsis> When they lost their sound, and make it more "mainstream"
<Tovler> darn flash game.
<ekips> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV5-B-368vU&
<Jim> "Mainstream" Hipster much?
<ekips> that concert is boos
<Snuffsis> Minutes to Midnight is where it started going downwards for them.
<CountDoofus> heh, MtM is my favorite album
<CountDoofus> guess I'm a mainstream beeyetch then
<Snuffsis> Jim: yes, very. I'm to hipster for Mainstream. :P
<KwakLad> ahhh comfort :p
<Dashie_Dashie> I rather hate Google chrome sometimes
<Snuffsis> I don't really like the sound they adopted for Minutes to Midnight, nothing special about it.
<Dashie_Dashie> random derps.
<KwakLad> why Dashie_Dashie ?
<KwakLad> ohh
<Snuffsis> Kwaklad, help!
<CountDoofus> so... Iridescent = junk?
<KwakLad> Snuffsis: did they use the 4 chords?
<KwakLad> alright Snuffsis pm then
<CCCP> Im in school right now
<Snuffsis> No idea what iridescent actually means. :P
<Ingwaz> Snuffsis: it means it glows
<CCCP> Teacher cant see me
<Snuffsis> Well, yea i know that ingwaz, but we're talking music. :P
<Ingwaz> Showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles.
<Ingwaz> oh....uhh...iridescent doesnt really apply to music..i dont think
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLYiIBCN9ec&ob=av2e
<Snuffsis> Oh, that one.
<Dashie_Dashie> Alright, time to watch MLP
<Ingwaz> Dashie_Dashie: its always time to watch mlp
<Snuffsis> No, i don't like that CountDoofus. xD
*Dashie_Dashie opens up torrent files
*Dashie_Dashie trollface
<Snuffsis> I did enjoy the first Transformer song. But that one is just extremely cheesy, and NOT linkin park
<Snuffsis> To me that is
<CountDoofus> well... I do, a lot, but who am I to judge you, right?
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSxxIqKNN0 this one is pretty good.
<Snuffsis> :P
<Dashie_Dashie> and then she looked around and was like WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOOO
<Kammerjunk> So it has come to this.
*Dashie_Dashie falls over
<Dashie_Dashie> I wub you pinkie :3
<CountDoofus> Oh yeah, New Divide is awesome
<CountDoofus> when LP played this song when I saw them live, I lost it
<Snuffsis> But usually i don't really judge bands for their overall performance, i judge songs seperately.
<Dashie_Dashie> hmm..
<Dashie_Dashie> swarm of the century or winter wrap up
<Dashie_Dashie> tough choice.
<Snuffsis> It's stupid to say that an artist is bad and never listen to that artist, when he/they can have perfectly good songs.
<Kammerjunk> Why not Lesson Zero?
<Dashie_Dashie> Don't have season 2 yet
<Kammerjunk> What a shame.

<CountDoofus> walking respawning points too, depending on your beliefs
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: jesus had a fibre connection to life

<Saturn> 08,01back in my day, we didn't have milk. or cups. or tea.

<Jim> nowai, me too!
<Midnight_Tempest> i never woulda guessed!
<Kammerjunk> Midnight_Tempest: I haven't seen Black Adder in a long time, actually.
<Jim> I love black adder ^^
<Midnight_Tempest> Kammerjunk: i used to watch it all the time with my uncle, same with monty python and red dwarf
<Snuffsis> Black Adder isn't really fun
<Kammerjunk> Everybody's dead, Dave.
<Snuffsis> Monthy Python is however
<Midnight_Tempest> BlackAdder is hilarious and it has House in it ^_^
<Jim> ...Are you trying to tell me that everybody's dead?
<Kammerjunk> ...Shouldn't have let him out in the first place.
<Midnight_Tempest> Damnit Jim! Im a doctor not a bricklayer!
<CountDoofus> does that mean I'm a zombie?
<Snuffsis> Discord, i'm howlin' at the moon. And lseepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon. Discord, whatever did we do, to make you take our world away?
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm going to go... Read or someting.
<Kammerjunk> something*
<Kammerjunk> I need to do SOMETHING for half an hour, so I might as well read fanfics.
<Snuffsis> No, do my homework i said!
<Midnight_Tempest> lol... read... o.o mfw the hall outside my room is filled with books
<CountDoofus> read "Twilight's Guilty Little Pleasure" (don't worry, it's not dirty)
<Kammerjunk> Midnight_Tempest: YFW I have several hundred books.
<Midnight_Tempest> Kammerjunk: as do i...
<Kammerjunk> Not psysically. I don't have space for several hundred books in my room.
<Kammerjunk> physically*
<Snuffsis> All my books are thrown into my dark and mysterious chamber
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw twilight will just use her unicorn magic on you.
<Midnight_Tempest> lol... i have actual paper books... hundreds of em...
<Snuffsis> aka walk-in closet used as a storage shed
<Dashie_Dashie> there's no escape.
<Snuffsis> STAY OUT OF MY SHED
<Midnight_Tempest> we dont talk about shed here...
<Jim> Can't one day go by without that being referenced?
<Dashie_Dashie> we talk about being violated by molestia.
<Snuffsis> We talk about MY shed, slight nicer than Fluttershys
<Dashie_Dashie> and possibly trixie..
<Midnight_Tempest> yes... definately trixie
<Kammerjunk> Violating Celestia is what I'll do for my birthday.
<Tovler> My shed is very shabby
<Kammerjunk> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-birthday-party-scenarios.jpg
<Dashie_Dashie> Trixie uses want/need spell on you
<Dashie_Dashie> >ohshit.jpeg
<Kammerjunk> I don't resist.
<Jim> I switched bodies with Mayor Mare
<Snuffsis> what is that kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: Your fate.
<Dashie_Dashie> ok who here besides me.. surfs 4chan /mlp/
<Snuffsis> OH NO
<CountDoofus> Started a gang with Princess Luna. And no, you can't join.
<Snuffsis> I get the pedo one...
<Moshakra> KKK WAZZUP
<Snuffsis> Switched Body with: Apple bloom. :(
<Moshakra> *KK
<Kammerjunk> The problem is that my brother is born the 30th of June.
<Kammerjunk> AKA, created battle clones of Gilda.
<Jim> Be afraid, be very afraid
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, did I say brother?
<Kammerjunk> I meant cousin.
<KwakLad> started a gang with Soarin
<Dashie_Dashie> Flutterstalker is best 4chan fanfic.
<Dashie_Dashie> just had to throw that out there.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Dashie_Dashie> /mlp/ fanfic
<CountDoofus> also Taurus, Kwak? good man
<Kammerjunk> I repeat my last message.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<KwakLad> Indeed CountDoofus
<Snuffsis> Why is living toombstone so awesome?
<Dashie_Dashie> flutterstalker.
<Dashie_Dashie> wut about her?
<KwakLad> Snuffsis cus why shouldnt he be?
<Kammerjunk> Because I've lost control of my life.
<Snuffsis> Kwaklad: He's distracting me
<Dashie_Dashie> Kammerjunk is curious yes?
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, emangamer.
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: ...Does it mean I can read more stuff?
<emangamer> hey Kammerjunk
<KwakLad> haha Snuffsis does the same to me :p
<emangamer> sup guys
<Dashie_Dashie> Depends.
<KwakLad> hey hey emangamer
*emangamer is at school'
<emangamer> ^_^
<Kammerjunk> Well, is it a fic?
<Dashie_Dashie> whats your take on Fluttershy basically being depicited as Molestia.
<otakon> emangamer: then PAY ATTENTION!
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: TIS A LIE!
<Dashie_Dashie> but with fluttershys sillyness.
<emangamer> otakon: bleh...
<Dashie_Dashie> shyness.
<Dashie_Dashie> goofyness
<Dashie_Dashie> ect
<otakon> TIS
<otakon> A
<otakon> LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dashie_Dashie> inb4 I link it to the chat.
<otakon> well
<Dashie_Dashie> I have a screen cap of it.
<Dashie_Dashie> xD
<otakon> is it SFW?
<Tovler> he, I was expecting: TIS
<Tovler> A
<Tovler> SPARTAAA!!
<Kammerjunk> YFW I'd put it at the back of my to-read list.
<Dashie_Dashie> lemme read over it, anons on 4chan /mlp/ tend to take the "Actual" fanfic out of boundries.
<Kammerjunk> Because that list is so long, anyway.
<Dashie_Dashie> the original poster did it very well
<KwakLad> CountDoofus i do hope you dont believe in astrology though :p
<Dashie_Dashie> lemme just skim it really quick otakon.
<CountDoofus> eh... I read my horoscope from time to time, but don't really pay much attention to it
<Kammerjunk> That's your horoscope for today.
<KwakLad> more than i do :
<KwakLad> p
<CountDoofus> oh really? what sign?
<CountDoofus> :$
<Kammerjunk> It's fun being born as cancer, actually.
<Tovler> birthdays during summer sounds pretty cool
<Kammerjunk> Well, I suppose there's that.
<Kammerjunk> But it makes being called cancer more fun.
<Snuffsis> Being born with cancer is hardly fun
<Dashie_Dashie> otakon, some parts are a littl NSFW other than that it's some what of a funny read.
<Kammerjunk> Alright, fine.
<Kammerjunk> Being born under cancer.
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: you are a cancer of the internet!
<KwakLad> according to some people
<Dashie_Dashie> anyone who wants flutterstalker semi-fanfic PM me
<Snuffsis> That must have been a big cancer tumour, to be born under it
<Jim> I have a friend who was born cancer. Kinda ironic because of the way she died.
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: oh u
<Snuffsis> :D
<Jim> Eaten by a giant crab
<otakon> Jim that is just...............
<Kammerjunk> So, Snuffsis, have you ever had a 'what the WTF' moment?
<otakon> O___o
<Tovler> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkmFgQ9fM94 /me will continue to read MLD while this music plays.
<Snuffsis> Quite a few actually
<Snuffsis> Why you ask?
<Kammerjunk> ...
<Kammerjunk> goddammit
<Jim> 'tis a joke
<emangamer> who's reading MLD:
<emangamer> I feel bad for them
<Kammerjunk> Not right now.
<CountDoofus> just saw that Flutterstalker tumblr... mfw dafuq
<KwakLad> emangamer: Tovler is
<emangamer> Tovler: you poor bastard
<Tovler> The fanfic is now 20% more kosher
<CountDoofus> I've read MLD... didn't do anything for me
<Snuffsis> Anyone want to see how it " kinda" looks like where i live?! :D
<Kammerjunk> Why the hay not.
<KwakLad> sure why not Snuf
<Jim> Why not
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0iCR4scRxE This was the first day though, lots more right now
<Snuffsis> xD
*emangamer hugs Tovler and hands him a kleanex
<emangamer> you'll need it
<Snuffsis> So very boring
<Kammerjunk> Dat ö.
<KwakLad> kinda dark :p
<Snuffsis> it gets lighter further in. :P
<Kammerjunk> I hate snö.
<Kammerjunk> It's too cold.
<Snuffsis> Snö is awesome
<Snuffsis> That day it was around -20
<emangamer> I cried when reading MLP after the first like 2 pages...IDK why but I felt so bad for the main character
<Kammerjunk> -20 C or F?
<Snuffsis> however, 2 days ago it was -32.
<Snuffsis> celsius ofcourse
<Kammerjunk> Good Goddesse.
<KwakLad> Snö is good if you dont get it much or if you like/love winter sports
<Kammerjunk> Goddesses*
<emangamer> silly Snuffsis all the cool people use kelvin
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Kelvin is for silly scientists.
<emangamer> Kelvin is the RIGHT tempature measuring scale
<Snuffsis> Kwaklad: We have about, where they haven't plowed ofcourse, 2 meters snow
<Kammerjunk> Celcius is good for everyday use.
<Kammerjunk> Fahrenheit is just silly.
<KwakLad> i think Snuffsis will be talking C not F Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: do you want to know the origion of Fahrenheit?
<Snuffsis> Kelvin is great, yea. But it's mostly used for science
<emangamer> I can tell you a story
<Jim> For science!
<Kammerjunk> emangamer: Would my answer matter?
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: no
<Kammerjunk> I thought so.
<Kammerjunk> Proceed, then.
<KwakLad> Does anyone know of Rankin for temperature
<Snuffsis> But, if you want i could say it was -241 if you'd like emangamer
<Snuffsis> No, wait, that's wrong
<KwakLad> 30 degrees Celsius = 545.67 rankine
<Snuffsis> that would be +241 only, just 241k
<Snuffsis> xD
<emangamer> Kammerjunk: Fahrenheit was made so that 100 degres was supposed to be body tempature. I'm assuming it could be used for medical reasons. However when he was making measurements there was an error and thats why 98.6 degrees is body tempature
<Snuffsis> K damnit!
<emangamer> actually the most persice measurement of temparture is in Joules
<Kammerjunk> What a silly filly who did that.
<Snuffsis> Wasn't it also used as the boiling point for Mercury or something silly like that?
<emangamer> its 10000 joules outside ^_^
<emangamer> Snuffsis: umm...no
<Snuffsis> Hmm, ok.
<Snuffsis> :P
<Kammerjunk> http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/7562/img2455b.jpg Fear my mediocre cleanliness and yet somewhat messiness!
<KwakLad> emangamer: i understand that farenheit is based on the boiling and meting points of two totally different chemicals
<Snuffsis> Thought i heard someone say sometihng about mercury when it comes to temperature
<emangamer> KwakLad: well your wrong
<KwakLad> which is what makes it even more stupid (if i remember right)
<Jim> nice wallpaper
<emangamer> hey Pinkies4thWall
<Pinkies4thWall> hey
<emangamer> L)
<KwakLad> hullo Pinkies4thWall
<emangamer> :)*
<Jim> ohai Pinkies4thwall
<CountDoofus> heya Pinkies4thWall
<Kammerjunk> Jim: I've changed it since then. It's Twilight Sparkle and Dashie related now.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Pinkies4thWall.
<emangamer> aww... Rain left
<emangamer> :(
<Pinkies4thWall> Love is...
<Kammerjunk> Whistles.
<Pinkies4thWall> yay
<emangamer> Pinkies4thWall: what is love?
<emangamer> baby dont hurt me
<emangamer> dont hurt me
<emangamer> no more
<Kammerjunk> Filly, don't buck me.
<Jim> o_O
<Snuffsis> What is up with the spam all of a sudden?
<Kammerjunk> Who spams what now?
<Pinkies4thWall> Your favorite food for breakfast, lunch and dinner
<Snuffsis> Well, it's almsot spam, lotso f people talking
<Snuffsis> It was nice when i could actually read what was being said. :(
<emangamer> Snuffsis: thats not spam...
<emangamer> this
<emangamer> is
<emangamer> spam
<emangamer> blah
<Dashie_Dashie> inbr dari-bot
<Dashie_Dashie> b4*
<emangamer> nope
*emangamer is immune to dari-bot apparently
<Snuffsis> But, emangamer
<Snuffsis> you did spam then.
<otakon> damn it
<Snuffsis> Since oyu did that silly song, you silly filly
<otakon> friggin daribot, STRIKE HIM DOWN!

<StickySyrup> true...
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<Dashie_Dashie> Trixie is mai Waifu
<CountDoofus> today's productivity... zilch. sounds about right
<Jim> bronystateI'mgonnaGetStuffDoneToday.jpg
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<Snuffsis> Hum hum.
<Snuffsis> can't find that pic
<Snuffsis> But, i guess i'm above you guys, since i'm actually doing math!
*Midnight_Tempest divides Snuffsis by 0. And I also did math.
<Snuffsis> That isn't math. That is Fringe-science
<Snuffsis> go away. :(
*emangamer arrests Midnight_Tempest
<emangamer> FREEZE
<emangamer> MATH POLICE
<Snuffsis> HALT HAMMERZEIT
<Midnight_Tempest> O.o um... science is just advanced math
<Snuffsis> No, science is simplified math.
<Snuffsis> Math is advanced science.
<emangamer> Midnight_Tempest: actually ^
<emangamer> science is math put into words
<CountDoofus> ... holy crap, welovefine added a Princess Luna in nouveau art style
<CountDoofus> http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=1801
<Snuffsis> Also, fringe-science = hokus-pkus like cold fusion.
<Snuffsis> OMG AWESOME
<Snuffsis> Maybe buy one sometime
<Jim> So awesome!
<CountDoofus> Le plaisir a été doublé!
<KwakLad> thats cool CountDoofus
<emangamer> Snuffsis: fringe-science?
<Snuffsis> Yea, Fringe-science, like alchemy and such
<Midnight_Tempest> basic science is simplfied math... other REAL science is more advanced, like physics... effin physics... >_< screw gravity
<CountDoofus> if they do Luna, they gotta add a Celestia some day
<emangamer> Snuffsis: well, conparitavely the sun could count as cold fusion
<emangamer> you have to heat hydrogen up to 100 times the sun's tempature to get fusion to begin
<Snuffsis> The energy isn't extracted from cold though.
<emangamer> energy isnt extraced from anything... :/
<Snuffsis> No, it's converted
<emangamer> correct
<Dashie_Dashie> want to learn physics? watch Pinkie pie in every episode of MLP
<Dashie_Dashie> get your masters degree.
<Snuffsis> But Cold Fusion hasn't been able to be duplicated, or proven. Which makes it a fringe science.
<Snuffsis> Like Science fiction
<Jim> That's how you break physics
<KwakLad> but the energy is leaving its original locationg sometimes with out direction so it is arguably acceptable to say that energy is extracted
<KwakLad> our* not out*
<Snuffsis> Kwaklad: One could say extracted when talking with regular people, but scientifically it's wrong.
<emangamer> Snuffsis: cold is a relative term
<Midnight_Tempest> cold fusion is still a possibility
<CountDoofus> someone really tried to explain physics in MLP, in class. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muVfidujxRg
<Snuffsis> emangamer: Ofcourse. that i know.
<emangamer> so the sun IS cold fusion
<emangamer> :P
<emangamer> CountDoofus: yea that video is great
<Snuffsis> Not to us thought.
<Snuffsis> though*
<emangamer> dark matter AJ?
<emangamer> Snuffsis: I ment compared to the tempature requred to get hydrogen fusion to start
<Snuffsis> ah
<emangamer> QUANTUM TUNNELING GO
*emangamer gets out his physical pick ax
<emangamer> physical meaning having the properties of physics not being real
<Snuffsis> Well, shit is hot on space, where there are stuff. :P
<Snuffsis> in*
<CountDoofus> jeaslousy has struck. http://i.imgur.com/l8Owo.png

<otakon> I can't wait until March 6th now.
<otakon> CountDoofus: lol
<Tovler> Now I can get that used Prius I've always wanted.
<Kammerjunk> Right. I'm going to go install ME2. About time I downloaded that game.

<Kammerjunk> Wait, what?
<Kammerjunk> 141*
<Eulshy> 1. Industrial size bag of salt, $10.00's.2. Snow shovel, $15.00's.3. Amount of physical therapy needed after shoveling wet packed snow in the rain, 500.00's.4. Snow day, Priceless.Money can't buy everything, but for everything else there's back pain
<Sundaysmile> $50 bucks of alcohol to kill the back pain
<Eulshy> 16
<Snuffsis> damn, that is expensive alcohol
<Kammerjunk> >$50 bucks
<otakon> Eulshy: lol
<Sundaysmile> I meant $50 WORTH of alcohol
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<otakon> try 80 bucks for a bottle of Everclear
<Midnight_Tempest> 50 bucks of alcohol to get my day going
<Kammerjunk> I was actually hoping Snuffsis would pick up on it.
<Eulshy> do you not understand i can not get any
<Eulshy> if i could i would have drank it
<Snuffsis> Why can't you get any?
<Eulshy> im 16
<Snuffsis> I got quite a lot i can share with you.
<Eulshy> and in the us
<Snuffsis> 16 is legal in denmark.
<Sundaysmile> Then Aspirin it is then
<Kammerjunk> You should totally move to Denmark.
<Eulshy> i wish
<CountDoofus> am I the only one that doesn't like alcohol?
<Eulshy> yup
<Sundaysmile> possibly
<Snuffsis> Ethanol by itself is probably not much to like
<Jim> I don't really drink
<Kammerjunk> Hell, we can't be worse at the economy than you!
<Snuffsis> But mix it with things and it's awesome
<alexxm> hey guys did i miss much
<Eulshy> i've had it before, my mom lets me
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'll have to be AFK for a few minutes.

<Eulshy> 40secs of my life
<Snuffsis> OMG
<Snuffsis> Those are huge
<Sundaysmile> bet they're tasty on a grill
<Jim> Have you seen the Giant Weta?
<Eye> I hate evolution sometimes ._.
<Jim> or as I like to call it: "The nomnomnomn carrot bug"
<Snuffsis> Bet Bear Grylls would grill it and go nomnomnom
<Sundaysmile> with a glass of finely aged piss
<Sundaysmile> and a lemon wedge
<Eye> Chat, why u no alive?
*Jim shrugpony
<Sundaysmile> I think I killed it with piss
<Eulshy> interesting insects
<Eulshy> found my biology report though thanks
<Wrek> 05syndicate after dinner, how 'bout that?
<Snuffsis> :O
<Jim> sounds cool
*RainBowJack hugs WREK
<Eye> naw, let's watch another episode of G3.5 ponies >.<
<Eulshy> naw let's say we did, and don't
<KwakLad> is that the original syndicate?
<Eulshy> meow meow meow
<CountDoofus> moar sea ponies!
<RainBowJack> Eye : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg just for you
<Sundaysmile> no.....
<Midnight_Tempest> so, you like syndicate Wrek?
<KwakLad> G3.5 ponies has no sea ponies
<RainBowJack> no sea ponies PLZ
<KwakLad> G3.5 (animation) only has earth and nothing else
<Wrek> 05loved the original
<Wrek> 05havent played the new one yet but ogt it isntalled
<Eye> RainBowJack: :{
<KwakLad> G1 is the one that sumica showed us
<Wrek> 05if the new one which i plan on streaming turns out to flop
<Wrek> 05i switch to either the calssic one, or art
<Eulshy> I just realized something we bronys must do
<RainBowJack> Eye : what?
<Snuffsis> I hope it's a decent game atleast, but i don't think it will live up to the old one.
<KwakLad> go on Eulshy
<Eulshy> We bronys must have Chuck norris as a brony
*RainBowJack is watching some MLP
<KwakLad> and sounds like a good plan Wrek
<Eye> RainBowJack: Old ponies are horrible D:
<Wrek> 05the impression i got is that the artstyle is the same, but other than that its a different game ocmpletly
*Coolbluemidnite is watching brony kid raps fast
<Sundaysmile> You doing single or multiplayer Wrek?
<KwakLad> Eulshy: i think a chuck norris pony has already been drawn loads of times
<Eulshy> no
<Wrek> 05not drawn
<Snuffsis> Yea, the setting is the same as well. Tried the multiplayer demo (which was boring) but singleplayer might be fun
<Wrek> 05converted
<Wrek> 05no demos were released for PC
<Eulshy> I mean we have to make chuck norris a brony
<Wrek> 05fuckign EA
<Snuffsis> Yea, i tried it on PS3.
<Wrek> 05i bet its because we would know how bad it was
<Wrek> 05>:P
*RainBowJack cant wait on Fighting is magic
<Snuffsis> :D
*Coolbluemidnite me too
<Wrek> 05if you ask me
<Snuffsis> But the first syndicate was also a console title so... :P
<Wrek> 05FiM will end up a great game, which alot of fun on meetups and between bronies in general
<Wrek> 05but
<Wrek> 05i cant see it keeping people entertained for extremly long periods
<RainBowJack> i hope it will have a online battle
<Sundaysmile> I think that's the point of the dlc packages
<Eulshy> MLP online?
<KwakLad> the pony RPG should be good though
<Wrek> 05i still have my original Mac OS 8 syndicate CDrom
<Sundaysmile> They're releasing em in stages
<KwakLad> and take a long time to play through
<Wrek> 05the MLP Online i can see going far if they pull it off properly
<Snuffsis> Wait, you talking about Fighting is Magic?
<Sundaysmile> yes
<Wrek> 05if being MLP beign the ONLY thing keepign it alive it wont last too long
<Eulshy> no i heard it has some things going
<Coolbluemidnite> I wanna play MLP online :3
<Eulshy> It's going to have dungeons i think
<RainBowJack> me too
<Coolbluemidnite> And ponykarts
<Eulshy> wanto play ponykarts so badly
<CountDoofus> http://www.mlponline.net/ <- this?
<Eulshy> yup
<Wrek> 05I also hope MLP Online will have a bit more grimdark approach than the series
<Coolbluemidnite> aww fluttershy is with a puppy
<Wrek> 05not in the way of like
<Eulshy> they haven't updated recently though
<Wrek> 05UBERGORE
<RainBowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1TcUzhb9o&feature=related NO!!!
<Wrek> 05but like
<Wrek> 05gah
<Wrek> 05you know what i mean
<Eulshy> they have a combat system
<Coolbluemidnite> A little gore but not ott mass killing?
<alexxm> has anyone seen the new nostagila critic
<Snuffsis> What is MLP online going to be?
<Snuffsis> MMORPG?
<Wrek> 05yes
<Eye> Probably
<Eulshy> go to the site and read
<RainBowJack> i love the way the animation in FiM is done
<Eulshy> yea MMORPG
<Snuffsis> cba. xD
<Wrek> 05you can never be assed >:3
<Snuffsis> I'm looking forward to Fighting is Magic the most
<Wrek> 05youre from skellefteå
<Wrek> 05xD
<Snuffsis> Wrek: I'm from Södertälje, i just moved here last year. so HAH!
<Wrek> 05FUUU
<Eye> Somehow i doubt they'll manage to pull off something like mlp online
<Wrek> 05but seriously no grudge!
*Wrek brohoof's Snuffsis
<RainBowJack> MLP online it will come
<Wrek> 05:3
<Eye> will the servers handle it? Will the design/balance be alright?
<Snuffsis> /)
<Wrek> 05(\
<Eye> Fighting is magic is much more likely to succeed though
<Sundaysmile> I take it Silent Ponyville's been canned?
<Snuffsis> I'm relaly hoping they pull off what they're talking about, trying to make it as smooth and with a high skill cieling so it could be competitive
<Sundaysmile> not seen an update in like forever
<RainBowJack> I love FiM seeing the videos of it
<Eye> Well, from the videos and streams they've released so far it looks nice. Every pony has fitting moves/style, the designers care about balance, etc.
<Snuffsis> Yea
<Snuffsis> That's what i hope they will keep up all the time. Would be amazing.
<Snuffsis> I loved when they showed pinkie and she did her jump attack going "WIIIIEE" :D
<Eye> The "brb" attack :p
<Eye> Really digging the animation too

<Kammerjunk> I take it the first pony is an OC?
<Coolbluemidnite> T_T im scared of spiders
<Kammerjunk> eye: I saw the URL, and I clicked anyway.
<Dashie_Dashie> welp, seeing as I'm already drop dead tired, I'm going to try and lucid dream when I go take a nap.
<Kammerjunk> Spiders are awesome.
<Dashie_Dashie> hopefully ponies will be involved.
<Snuffsis> eye, go away, thats not daw :(
<Kammerjunk> It is so daw!
<eye> Snuffsis: evolution at its finest
<CountDoofus> I dreamed of a spider last night. woke up in a pool of sweat
<MakerDusk> Dashie_Dashie: lucid dreaming is lots of fun
<Snuffsis> You're wrong
<Snuffsis> Cockroaches = evolution at its finest
<MakerDusk> got to hug celestia :p
<Dark_Horst> this luna here is pretty cute too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXUzM4bSSUI
<Dashie_Dashie> If I saw that shit in my vecinity, it'd get shot with a shotgun.
<Coolbluemidnite> cockroaches are eww T_T
<Kammerjunk> Ponies = Evolution at it's best.
<Dashie_Dashie> I hate spiders.
<Saturn> 08,01spiders are <3
<Kammerjunk> ^
<eye> Lies
<Snuffsis> Spiers are amazing creatures, i agree, but they're hardly cute.
<Snuffsis> You guys are weird.
<Dark_Horst> how does one learn to lucid dream?
*Snuffsis is scared.
<Coolbluemidnite> I sat on a spider once
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek might like this, http://youtu.be/cKpK4Wc5TvI
<Snuffsis> Dark_Horst, first thing is to get a notepad and a pen, and start writing down every dream you can remember once you've had them.
<eye> I really hope that within my lifetime the neuroscience will become advanced enough to cure arachnophobia ._.
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: I'd link you to a copypasta picture I have of it, but it's on my harddrive and I'm a lazy git.
<MakerDusk> Dark_Horst: lots of deep meditation practice, shifting your sleep pattern, and having a tell
<Snuffsis> After a while you'll be able to be aware that you are dreaming, and thus control your dreams
<Coolbluemidnite> Spiders are scary but dogs are worse o_o
<Dark_Horst> welp, time to try
<eye> Ohhhhh lucid dreams :3
<Snuffsis> It takes lots of practice, as in months, unless you are really able to do it.
<MakerDusk> basically, to lucid dream, rem has to be the first cycle
<Kammerjunk> Spiders are adorable, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
<Dashie_Dashie> I was on the brink of Lucid dreaming the other night, goddamned cat woke me up.
<eye> MakerDusk: Not necessarily
<Kammerjunk> What a party pooper your cat is.
<MakerDusk> Dashie_Dashie: that's always the worst
<MakerDusk> eye: actually yes
<NewDCD> 09,01no but really, can anybody link me to pics of yesterday's shit. I wanna show them to somebody
<eye> there are many methods of induction
<Dashie_Dashie> many rages were given.
<Kammerjunk> What's yesterday's shit?
<MakerDusk> the cycles being shifted is key though
<RainBowJack> NewDCD you looked funny being all hyper on cam with the Pirat Rangers and stuff
<RoseyPony> hmm anyone wanna listen to a nice ost
<MakerDusk> if you don't start off with rem, you won't be able to remember
<Coolbluemidnite> Ever had a dream in a dream? where you wake up but your still dreaming
<Dashie_Dashie> rem?
<MakerDusk> the actual lucid dreaming does not usually occur during the first rem cycle
<Kammerjunk> Oh, C&CG:ZH. Why you so awesome?
<NewDCD> 09,01yesterday's shit was
<NewDCD> 09,01some camwhoring shit I
<MakerDusk> Coolbluemidnite: my record is going three levels down
<Kammerjunk> Aha.
<MakerDusk> I decided to try it one day
<Dark_Horst> which one the the shit you are referring to precidels?
<Dark_Horst> *precisely
<Snuffsis> NewDCD i think it was Tovler that frapsed it, he isn't here though i think
<MakerDusk> apparently you can go to sleep in your dreams
<NewDCD> 09,01did to distract you guys while an episode of Gokaiger downloaded
<Kammerjunk> Nice one.
<NewDCD> 09,01and then, inception
<Coolbluemidnite> MakerDusk i've only had one because someone threw me out a window in my dream and it woke me up o.O
<Dark_Horst> ah, that
<Snuffsis> Also, regarding lucid dreaming. the BEST thing you can do while doing it is to fly
<Snuffsis> The sensation is so awesome
<Kammerjunk> I had lucid dream once.
<eye> Let's all get to the limbo and build ponyville there
<RoseyPony> hmm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18kR48oYzE&feature=related
<Kammerjunk> It was trippy.
<Coolbluemidnite> I panic when i fly in dreams
<Dashie_Dashie> If I make myself fly, it better damn well be with Rainbow dash
<Tovler> Frapsed?
<Coolbluemidnite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNAdtkSjSps
<Snuffsis> Tovler: Wasn't it you that filmed NewDCD?
<Coolbluemidnite> <3
<MakerDusk> Snuffsis: I disagree, make a jet out of think air while jumping off a building and control it with your mind
<Tovler> Snuffsis: Nope
<Snuffsis> MakerDusk: Well, there are lots of things that are awesome, but i personally love just flying in the dreams. i get chills down my spine
<Dark_Horst> i'm just lucky if i can even remember the chaotic bullshit that i dream once in a lue moon
<MakerDusk> or take on a dragon with an smg on a snowmobile
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<alexxm> anyone seen the new nostagila critic yet
<Dark_Horst> nope
<Dark_Horst> show
<Coolbluemidnite> I have a recurring dream where i see a shadow in a red cape and it runs at me and then i wake up
<MakerDusk> I didn't mean to make the dragon... but once it was there it was kinda too late >_<
<Snuffsis> I once dreamt i was fighting with some bullies, so i gave myself super powers. xD
<Coolbluemidnite> xD
<Kammerjunk> The only lucid dream I recall was that I was in this canyon made of clouds. Suddenly, A WILD FLOOD APPEARS! It takes me with it, and then there was an alligator for some reason. I kicked it and woke up.
<Snuffsis> Dreaming is Crazy
<Dashie_Dashie> I've drempt of falcon pawnching so much shit.
<Kammerjunk> It was trippy.
<Coolbluemidnite> Best dream i ever had was when i was a dinosaur
<WorkingVanilla> 06Dashie_Dashie <3
<Coolbluemidnite> rawr :[
<Dashie_Dashie> ViVi <3
<Dark_Horst> ionce was a dog surfing through an ice canyone towards something that looked like a crossover between ironforge and ogrimmar
<Dark_Horst> what does that mean? probably that itt's a good thing i quit WoW
<Coolbluemidnite> then what happened o.o
<eye> I once dreamt of being able to take off the skin of my hand like it was a glove D:
<Coolbluemidnite> Eww...
<Kammerjunk> Asides from that, I really can't remember my dreams.
<Dashie_Dashie> but still, My cat waking me up on the brink of Lucid dreaming...
<Dashie_Dashie> really russled my jimmys
<Kammerjunk> Not consciously, at any rate.
<eye> Well, tbh it was kinda cool
<RoseyPony> heh
<RoseyPony> well here's something
<RoseyPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b44KGOIqzRg
<Kammerjunk> Dashie_Dashie: That whippersnapper, eh?
<Snuffsis> Why would you dream of just falcon punching stuff dashie? xd
<Dashie_Dashie> damn whippersnappers.
<Dark_Horst> Dashie_Dashie that's why you keep cats on the other side of the door to your room
<Dashie_Dashie> dumb fabric.
<Dashie_Dashie> mfw I left my window open.
<Kammerjunk> You actually do HAVE to say "whippersnappers" as if you were an old man.
<Dashie_Dashie> cats all HUR DUR IMA JUMP IN HUR
<Kammerjunk> Else, you're doing it wrong.
<Dashie_Dashie> HAI WUTS GOIN ON IN HUR DASHIE.

<Snuffsis> Jim: but, no pony.

<Kammerjunk> He's not that fat.
<eye> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHwu-H_KtfU&feature=related
<Kammerjunk> Oh, yeah. He sleeps, eats, and is outside.
<Dark_Horst> and dunno if it's just me, but really, isn't it just the cutest thing ever if you open your door in the morning and your little buddy sits there with a mouse in his mouth that he caught JUST for you?
<eye> I promise it's not a spider this time
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: That is kind of cute, yeah.
<Dark_Horst> i d'aaaaw so hard everytime

<Dark_Horst> but i'm afraid my cat has a beard fetish
<Jim> that's a nice cat Dashie_Dashie
<Snuffsis> Cats aren't spoiled though, they just do what they want Dashie. :P
<Snuffsis> Cats actually think you are their servant, not their master.

<Snuffsis> HAHA
<Snuffsis> Awesome
<Kammerjunk> eye: I approve this image.
<Jim> Carl Sagan and Twilight are best buddies
<Kammerjunk> I can imagine they'd be.
<KwakLad> Carl Sagan!
<Snuffsis> Carl Sagan the greatest hero there is for science
<eye> Unfortunately haven't seen any decent ponified Carl Sagan :(
<Snuffsis> was*
<Dark_Horst> ....that's a mighty ship you have there
<Kammerjunk> Which reminds me, I really should get around to reading Dawkins and Darwin.
<Dark_Horst> why, it could round the world in a single stroke, i say
<Snuffsis> haha i found this one http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/130/0/f/my_little_carl_sagan_pony_by_kyrospawn-d3g1mds.png

<Kammerjunk> Shizuka.
<Jim> mentlegen
<Dark_Horst> MOD ON DECK!
<Shizuka> 13yesterday i brought news of activity on the baldurs gate site, indicative of OHGOG MORE BALDURS GATE COMING?
<Snuffsis> RoseyPony: <3<3<3
<Kammerjunk> Mods are awake.
<Kammerjunk> Post ponies.
<Shizuka> 13but that was just speculation
<CountDoofus> greeting Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13TODAY
<Shizuka> 13I BRING YOU
<alexxm> so is everyone going to vote for a godzilla movie this week
<Shizuka> 13http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?p=35585202 SIM CITY 5 IS COMING
<Jim> ooh, pretty cool
<Kammerjunk> I have never played Sim City.
<Dark_Horst> oi?
<KwakLad> sim city 5 not as cool as baldurs gate would have been
<Jim> ^
<Dark_Horst> looks shineys
<Kammerjunk> I remember playing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance.
<Kammerjunk> That was fun.
<Snuffsis> Baldurs Gate is kinda meh. Good for it's time, but now not really. :P
<eye> ^
*Snuffsis puts on flame retardant coat
<KwakLad> maybe dnd based RPG's just need a general reboot?
<alexxm> so theres no stream
<Kammerjunk> I was pretty young back then, so I just remember fragments.
<Jim> That's your opinion and you're entiteled to it
<Kammerjunk> "It's locked."
*Tovler is still waiting for Kung Pow to selected as B movie.
<Kammerjunk> You know, I have never played DnD.
<Snuffsis> Jim: damnit jim, stop being so damn level-headed, logaical and reasonable!
<Kammerjunk> My friends just never cared to play it with me.
<Dark_Horst> i'd probably give it a try if i'd know any DnDers
<eye> Jim: if you look at it as if a designer would, it has many flaws in its gameplay
<Dark_Horst> i'm curious
<Shizuka> 13apparently sim city 4 didn't actually have will wright behind it :o
<Dark_Horst> lol
*MASF123 leaves
<Jim> Probably, I liked the gameplay a lot though
<Kammerjunk> eye: Good thing I'm not a designer.
<Jim> bye masf
<RoseyPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqB1MbXSeGk&feature=related
<Dark_Horst> hey, shizuka, wanna stream something?
<eye> by today's standards, i mean
<Snuffsis> I remember when Spore looked to be awesome, but then it wasnät
<Jim> So much cool octavia music RoseyPony :)
<RoseyPony> heh :)
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: Eeyup.
<Kammerjunk> I think I would have played Spore more if it was multiplayer.
<Snuffsis> OH YEA Octacia drum n bass! :D
<Kammerjunk> Not necessarrily MMO, just multi-player.
<Snuffsis> It was kind of multiplayer, you shared creations... :P
<Jim> Yeah, true
<Kammerjunk> Asides from that, though.
<Jim> I liked the space age of Spore
<Snuffsis> Then they made Dark Spore, which i laughed at
<alexxm> so what have you guys voted for this week
<Jim> managed to get to the centre of the universe once too
<Dark_Horst> i played spore
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: Yeah, that was pretty weird.
<Dark_Horst> two days later i wondered why the fuck i did
<Kammerjunk> Jim: What you get there is pretty neat, I suppose.
<Kammerjunk> I was hoping for something better, though.
<Snuffsis> Dark Spore was decent, but lots of things ruined it. Boosting being impossible was one thing. :P
<Kammerjunk> I don't mean Dark Spore, either. I just want to play Spore with a friend.
<Kammerjunk> Also, I never managed to find Earth in Spore.
<Jim> I did!
<KwakLad> ive never seen dark spore
<Snuffsis> I found earth, but it was lame
<Jim> It was on a solar system named Sol
<Kammerjunk> You can't even see Denmark, the way I understand it.
<Kammerjunk> Though I suppose that's fair enough.
<RoseyPony> heh interesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYE9mVcNh0

<BigMacCopy> Snuffis: Eeyyyup.

<dr-whooves> I hatch from a roosters egg,attack me with sword and mage.But if you look into my eyes, you will meat a stone demise.what am I?
<BrokenPinkiePieCopy> Cockatrice
<alexxm> basalsik
<Snuffsis> Basilisk
<KwakLad> cockatrice
<Jim> Is this a game of hide and seek with 20% more guns?
<dr-whooves> cockawhat cockaduce cockatrice! The answer is the third
<dr-whooves> OH WHAT FUN
<BrokenPinkiePieCopy> I ZZZT was ZZZT right
<Coolbluemidnite> shoot everything
<dr-whooves> Dont you love games
<Jim> The animus?

<Snuffsis> But whooves, both basilisk and cockatrice is the correct answer!
<BrokenPinkiePieCopy> CAn ZZZZTT someone ZZZZT fix the copyZZZT machine so ZZZt I can be fixed...??? ZZZZ
<KwakLad> Snuffsis: basilisk is a lizard and does not hatch from the egg of fowl
*Jim sends BrokenPinkiePieCopy to service
<Snuffsis> true
<Snuffsis> but they are hatched from eggs
<alexxm> when did this become assassins creed
<dr-whooves> STONE demise
<Jim> How romantic
<sharklion> batman now
<ThatsAShinySkyi> LOL
<dr-whooves> basalisk kills with a single glance
<sharklion> batman seems to be in a coat
<Coolbluemidnite> bless you
<dr-whooves> a cockatrice turns you into stone
<Snuffsis> Aaah
<sharklion> and swallowed a gravel beach
<dr-whooves> WHo will accept my challenge of wit
<KwakLad> hes gonna kiss you wrek
<Snuffsis> But wouldn't being turned into stone actually kill you though?
<sharklion> so does a basilisk
<sharklion> I swear
*BrokenPinkiePieCopy comes back fixed
<Snuffsis> Actually Kwaklad: The book says that the basilisk was first created by Herpo the Foul, a wizard who hatched a chicken egg beneath a toad
<RainbowJack> that guy looks like Sheperd
<dr-whooves> but as stated the basalisk's gaze kills but no stone
<Jim> Dr. Drew
<Snuffsis> yea
<KwakLad> sharklion: no basilik only kills or petrifies not converts to stone
<PinkiePieCopy> I'm back but I might have some errors
<KwakLad> Snuffsis: okay
<PinkiePieCopy> And the fact I have a red cyborg eye
<sharklion> dammit mythology! y u no simple!
<Snuffsis> Very small difference there, but i stand corrected. You have outsmarted me dr-whooves
<Jim> PinkiePieCopy 9000?
<Snuffsis> But, can you outsmart bullet?
<Snuffsis> i think not
<KwakLad> Snuffsis: a basilisk is also a real creature and is quite small and poses nearly no threat to a human
<Snuffsis> KwakLad, but the mythological basilisk. xD
<dr-whooves> A bullet has not a brain. i can outsmart metal i cannot out runone
<PinkiePieCopy> Yeah, it acts as a scouter. And now I use windows, so I might craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Coolbluemidnite> turn into mare do well -presses button-

<sharklion> you died

<sharklion> I agree with your agreeable nature
<RoboGerbil> your problem is your bullets dont fly straight
<Dashie_Dashie> I return from my Dr. appointment
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Hip hip HURRAH for the USSR!
<Coolbluemidnitee> 6.At night they come without being fetched. By day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?
<Dashie_Dashie> and Wrek is playing syndicate.
<Dashie_Dashie> awesome.
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: YAY!!!!
<Coolbluemidnitee> At night they come without being fetched. By day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?
<sharklion> we are sending our men to outta space
<CCCP> Coolbluemidnitee: ponies
<CCCP> I love that video
<Kammerjunk> Coolbluemidnitee: With free will?
<KwakLad> CCCP then you obviously dont agree with communism fully
<Kammerjunk> Teenagers! They're teenagers!
<Coolbluemidnitee> IDK i just read the thing
<sharklion> sleep
<Coolbluemidnitee> and no cccp ponies dont get lost
<Jim> Furbies
<Coolbluemidnitee> nope
<sharklion> sleep is lost
<Coolbluemidnitee> nope
<CCCP> KwakLad: it has its flaws (just like any other form of government)
<Coolbluemidnitee> its in the sky
<sharklion> the moooon
<Coolbluemidnitee> nope
<sharklion> stars!
<KwakLad> CCCP if you believed in the reality of what communism SHOULD be then you should not like defining seperate nations as all should belong to everyone
<Jim> The Stars
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: Knowing humans, communism would never work anyway, no matter how good it is.
<Coolbluemidnitee> Sharklion got it 1st

<Dashie_Dashie> DED
<Kammerjunk> We've seen this before.
<CCCP> KwakLad: i guess u are right
<sharklion> communism works in equestria
<CCCP> ^
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: hence my putting 'SHOULD' not 'should' or 'is' or whatever else would fit grmatically but essentially be wrong
<Kammerjunk> Equestria isn't populated by humans.
<Coolbluemidnitee> There was a green house. Inside the green house there was a white house. Inside the white house there was a red house. Inside the red house there were lots of babies. What is it?
<sharklion> or is it......
<Dashie_Dashie> Equestria is the only place where communism works, cause' you know.
<Dashie_Dashie> everyone happy.
<CCCP> Coolbluemidnitee: 4chan

<PinkiePieCopy> A man was found dead in his study. He was slumped over his desk and a gun was in his hand. There was a cassette recorder on his desk. When the police entered the room and pressed the play button on the tape recorder they heard: "I can't go on. I have nothing to live for." Then there was the sound of a gunshot.

<PinkiePieCopy> You are walkin down a path that turns into a fork in the road. One path leads to heaven and one path leads to hell. You don't know which is which. Both paths are guarded by an angel. One angel always lies. The other angel always tells the truth. However, you don't know which angel is which either. If you can only ask one question to one angel, what question can you ask to figure out which path leads to heaven?

<Jim> ohai Jaketehsnake
<Jaketehsnake> Hi Jim!
<Vinyl> You have no weapons Wrek, you have to shoot his missles back at him
<Cypresswolf> What most consider to be weeds are native plants that grow naturally, but dont look good in the modern standard of a "nice lawn"
<Vinyl> hehe
<Jaketehsnake> I went to El Zorro! The Musical! Twas weird having my theatre teacher be in it. She was a gypsy and a t one point, "Seduced" another character. Perspective of my teacher=Blown
<Snuffsis> What i consider to be weed is a nice green blunt that can be burnt and inhaled for recreative purposes. :D
<FeArLeSs_0117> or not
<pony> :D
<FeArLeSs_0117> vinyl, pick up
<Vinyl> Oh Wrek don't worry ^^ I just know this part from a rooster teeth video c;
<Cypresswolf> I let them grow in abundance in the back yard, they look pretty when theyre all in bloom
<Snuffsis> This is like Ganon tennis
<Cypresswolf> yellows, blues, purples, lots of green, and they attract a beautiful array of insects
<Snuffsis> except with breach instead of sword

<FlutterDashTheMicX3> the only reason we luv derpy so much is because she a character born from the fans she out baby and we cant let out baby die !
<Meanwhile> Tictac: Eeyup.
<Snuffsis> Derpy_Hooves: quite a bit of that is wrong though
<Tictac> Voice Changed
<Tictac> Named Changed
<_Rarity_is_best_pony> mmmhmmm
<_Rarity_is_best_pony> go derpy
<Tictac> Eyes Changed
<RaveBrony> Derpy = Entire Brony Community :D
<Meanwhile> Tictac: You should probably read Derpy_Hooves link.
<Tictac> Oh well
<Tictac> 5t6rrt gbyhtv
<Tovler> It's too expensive to remove derpy and it's not Hasbro got sued and lost. They could potentially leave her canon if they wanted.
<Tictac> Thats what happens when I smash my head on the keyboard
<kenne> dat lightning D=
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> MY LITTLE PONY ON CAHNNEL 65 RIGHT NOW JUST STARTING ::::::>>>:>:>:>
<RaveBrony> Aw, wth. What happened to the other drawing it was nice :o
<Tictac> Someone put dat shit on
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> OH WAIT 4 SQUARE IS ON
<RaveBrony> Lol, I got an earliy dose of pony thanks to Sbs stream this morning :D
<unfoundbug> is there a group of anything going atm, other than terraria?
<RoboGerbil> wanna play realm of the mad god?
<Eulshy> the terraria isn't working
<MirrorImage> Tovler - sued for what?
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> mlp coming on ch 65 in a couple minutes BEWARE !!!!
<MirrorImage> the legal department would've caught anything to be sued over before that episode went out in the first place
<Silver_Streak> hello everypony
<MirrorImage> heck, there's lawsuits going on right now to overturn the FCC's obscenity filters for tv anyways
<MirrorImage> i.e. the 2004 Super Bowl incident
<Snuffsis> A spokeswoman for Hasbro came out and said:
<Snuffsis> "Some viewers felt that aspects of the episode 'The Last Roundup' did not stay true to the core message of friendship which is the heart and soul of the series. Hasbro Studios decided to make slight audio alterations to this single episode."
<MirrorImage> ...scratch that, not the 2004 super bowl
<Tictac> Freakin FFC
<Silver_Streak> who's drawing?
<MirrorImage> but things like profanity would be legit
<Meanwhile> Wrek is drawing.
<Tovler> I dunno, defamation, I guess.
<Snuffsis> Basically saying "She wasn't normal and fitting in, so we changed her"
<Silver_Streak> oh
<Silver_Streak> not bad
<MirrorImage> defamation of who?
<Tictac> Im not watching it
<Tictac> I jused paused it to chat
<MirrorImage> defamation implies that you ruined the reputation of an actual person or company maliciously
<Eulshy> well,terraria isn't connecting
<Meanwhile> Defamation of a grey horse with crossed eyes.
<Meanwhile> Someone think of the horses!
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> how can they call derpy a mock to retard when they keep spongebob and patrick and many other stupid characters from different shows derpy only said 5 words compared to them and shes censored
<Meanwhile> Well, some people are stupid.
<Eulshy> because those shoes are popular
<Meanwhile> Tragic fact of life.
<MirrorImage> in general, you can get away with less in live-action TV than you can in animated shows, even more so in the case of fantasy settings
<Eulshy> *shows
<Silver_Streak> oh great derpy again
<MirrorImage> so if a live-action TV show could get away with a "Derpy character," which many shows have done, and done so a lot less kindly
<Meanwhile> Dem popular shoes.
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> wth am i watching lol 4 square on tree house
<RoboGerbil> ugh, why do we keep talking about derpy.. thats dead horse has been beaten so many times
<Eulshy> spongebob is much more popular than MLP as much as i pain to admit
<Meanwhile> Spongebob has been around a hell of a lot longer.
<Eulshy> exactly
<Eulshy> people expect it
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> Mlp IS ON IN 2 MINUTED CHANNEL 65 GET ON IT
<MirrorImage> and spongebob isn't quite so... pink
<Photon-Phoenix> A lot of things are more popular than MLP given the fact that everything before 2010
<Wrek> 05so far so sketchy
<Snuffsis> I see wings
<Meanwhile> Still, we need to wait before christianity accuses MLP of spreading gay tolerance or witchcraft before really getting our torches out.
<Eulshy> FlutterDashTheMicX3 we don't all have the same tv do we, or the same cable proveder or satilite
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> mlp the only show that has a litteral army over the internet
<Garrus_Vakarian> This is very good work.
<Meanwhile> >Implying MLP is the only show with a fandom.
<kenne> oh noez more lightning :S
<Eulshy> if lauran faust told us to riot in the streets we probably would
<Meanwhile> I do that anyway.
<Midnight_Fyre> I would
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> Swarm of the century on channel 65
<Snuffsis> Wrek, would you grant me your drawing talent if i asked?
<Eulshy> FDTM shut up pls
<FlutterDashTheMicX3> srry :'(

<Meanwhile> An average shield?
<Eulshy> what kind of sheild?
<RaveBrony> *know how big
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> big enough to protect its uder
<Eulshy> buckler, body, kite?
<Meanwhile> Depends on the model.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> *user
<Aircrafter> Meanwhile: Eh I was afraid at first. Then I watched relieve videos and I started laughing.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RaveBrony: depends of the type
<RaveBrony> Hmmm....
<RaveBrony> That brings many more questions...
<Ziltoidian> sound dead
*RaveBrony walks at a steady pace to google
<Eulshy> A buckler is small and round like a large dinner plate, smallest sheild
<Eulshy> a kite is the largest usually bigger than the person having to be carried on back and placed in front
<RaveBrony> Ah, a kite then! :)
<Eulshy> you sure?
<Eulshy> what are you making it out of?
<RaveBrony> Im drawing it for my oc :P
<Eulshy> oh
<Jaketehsnake> Ohai.

<CCCP> RaveBrony: can u send link when ur done?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep ~

<CCCP> RaveBrony: thats okay :)
<Ziltoidian> Cracked is best website
<Meanwhile> WRONG.
<Ziltoidian> oh
<Jaketehsnake> I like gizmodo as well
<Meanwhile> Bronystate is best website.
<Ziltoidian> dat pandering
<RaveBrony> My question earlier in the week was answered that i should use plate armor instead of chain
<Meanwhile> ^.^
<Jaketehsnake> But yes Bronystate beats them all
<Eulshy> RaveBrony Kite sheilds are usually used by armies so that they may hold them above their heads to protect from incoming arrows
<Photon-Phoenix> Challenge, win the 100% positive ending in Facade using only the themesong from MLP:FiM and names of the characters and the title of the show

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kernel S.O.S i guess he went into panic ~
<RoflBot> awesome MW2 music

<MeanwhileSeapony> Searching for sympathy yielded no results. Neither did sympathetic pony. D:

<Midnight_Fyre> Yeah, I know. I've sort of got that obsessive personality that let's worry get the better of me when I hear about something upsetting, and I recently read an article about one of Hasbro's toy manufacturers.
<SuperBrony64> I'll be the pony to ask you, "Who's our favorite pony?" randomly and without warning
<Wrek> 05this next one shouldnt be too hard
<Yahooz> CupcakeWarrior: Entertaining us in the most epic way possible in IRL

<RAWRity> emangamer: still working on it. Been busy as a mofo with everything this week.
<NullRadix> Yoshi's Story has the unfortunate disadvantage of being... weird...
<NullRadix> also, it's not mobile
<emangamer> RAWRity: yea? thats bitttersweet I guess
<Wrek> 05i wonder if you will get this one
<mario_pony> who was everyponies favorite super mario villain?
<RAWRity> Luigi
<mario_pony> mine was princess shroob
<LadyCanary> ....Aaaaargh~
*Kipkat07 lives in CT and hates the winters here
<mario_pony> RAWRity: luigi?
<LadyCanary> Weeeegeeeee.
<Eulshy> tough decision
<RAWRity> Beause Luigi is secretly Bowser in disguise
<LadyCanary> So familiar...OISJF
<CupcakeWarrior> Sounds familiar
<mario_pony> RAWRity: do you mean Mr. L?
<CCCP> at school today i acidentally said everypony when reffering to everybody multipul times.
<Ziltoidian> nice
<Tovler> mario_pony: Mine is Fawful
<Ocean> Kipkat07: I used to live in CT, I was born there. I'd love to change places with you!
<kenne> you r teh best
<RAWRity> mario_pony: no. I mean Luigi.
<NullRadix> I think this might be Luigi's Mansion music?
<CupcakeWarrior> CCCP: How did people react?
<Jaketehsnake> AUGH MY EARS
<Tovler> O'Chunks and Dimentio were pretty cool
<RAWRity> Luigi is the secret mastermind behind all of the troubles that strike Mario
<Jaketehsnake> I cam back to earrape
<Eulshy> my favorite mario villian is Huff n Puff
<CCCP> mario_pony: u mean the villian version of Luigi in Super Paper Mario?
<NullRadix> either that or chat is corrupting my mind while I'm trying to place it
<Tovler> Pretty much every villian in the RPG spinoffs really
<mario_pony> CCCP: yeah
<LadyCanary> TT_TT I dont knoooow what this iiiis
<mario_pony> Bowser will always have a special place in my heart.
<Jaketehsnake> I should really turn down volume before entering a new stream with headphones XD. Anyway, anypony up for some FREGGIN VIDEPOGAMES?
<Ocean> Sounds like heavy metal.
*Kipkat07 is moving to Florida liek a bau5
<CCCP> CupcakeWarrior: they didn't seem to notice it that much but they thought it was weird. I dont think any one in my town even knows what a brony is.
<kenne> its a heavy remix and it is awesome
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: naw
<otakon> actually guys, brb need to clean the kitchen
<Eulshy> my favorite villian tie between Smithy and the Axem Rangers from super mario R+RPG and Huff n Puff from paper mario
<Wrek> 05no one guessed it yet!?
<Jaketehsnake> Darn Otakon. Have fun cleaning~
<Wrek> 05wow
<Kipkat07> taco bell
<CCCP> otakon: with help from pinkie pie
<LadyCanary> It's sooo familiar.
<otakon> CCCP: I wish
<NullRadix> Axem Rangers were good. Smithy... didn't really have much "Villain interaction" with him
<Wrek> 05MM3
<otakon> LadyCanary: it's um..... I know what it is
<otakon> I KNEW what it was
<CupcakeWarrior> It is?
<Kipkat07> lolwut
<CupcakeWarrior> Which stage?
<Eulshy> Smithy was the big boss at the end of Super mario RPG
<kenne> whats with all the MM's and FF's do you really love the consistency that much?
<NullRadix> MM3? I should have gotten that one
<LadyCanary> Ahh MegaMan3
<Wrek> 05bonustrack inbound
<Ocean> I've never played MW3, so I'm unfamiliar with it.
<mario_pony> the Princess shroob boss battle was epic!
<emangamer> how are you tonight LadyCanary?
<kenne> omg yay
<otakon> kenne: bc, they have the BEST SOUNDTRACKS EVER!
<unfoundbug> i got bf3, not mw3
<Jaketehsnake> Oh yes
<LadyCanary> Well wanting to speak to a certain somepony, emangamer. And you?
<otakon> suddenly Ducks?
<GrimGallop> I was just looking through the D&D Monster Manual 3 when I saw you say MM3 o.o

<Wrek> 05improvised theme for the game, duck hunt
<Jaketehsnake> Otakon Suddenly Ducks.
<LadyCanary> Ducks, ducks errywhere.
<otakon> The Majestic Space Duck
<emangamer> LadyCanary: well I'm sure you'll speak to them soon. and I'm doing pretty good tonight thanks :)
<LadyCanary> Why not spaceducks.
<otakon> okay, brb
<LadyCanary> QUACK
<Jim> Crazy ducks in space
<mario_pony> that boss battle took me like 5 hours
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i hate the dog in that game ...

<Eulshy> Who thinks I should play pokemon or work on my story?
<Jaketehsnake> Brb, Foodtimes. Also, DUCKS.... IN SPACE Space space space *echotrailsoff*
<mario_pony> Eulshy: story

<mario_pony> Eulshy: i mean all of them!
<Eulshy> thats my favorite mario RPG
<Jim> Oh, I know this
<Placebo> Rainbow dash always dressed in style.
<Dark__Horst> if you think transformers, you're right
<NullRadix> funny... I was reading about N64's being used as doorstops earlier...
<Meeplord> ive played super mario rpg
<Meeplord> ......stupid boss cake
<Eulshy> paper mario has the highest replay value of all the super mario RPG's
<mario_pony> i liked partners in time better
<kenne> backround voices remind me of castlecrashers =P
<CCCP> VNES.com
<CCCP> Virtual nes
<NullRadix> paper mario is good because it KNOWS it's a single player game and can throw balance and risk/reward factors to high hell
<mario_pony> transformers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<unfoundbug> robots in disguise
<NullRadix> freaking badge system...
<CupcakeWarrior> What song is this?
<mario_pony> more than meets the eye
<Eulshy> i recently did paper mario with max bp and 20 hp and 10 fp, and i beat it
<LadyCanary> :D
<CupcakeWarrior> What game is this from?
<mario_pony> NullRadix: in which game bowsers inside story?
<Dark__Horst> "game" he says
<CCCP> has any one seen Chuggaconroy?
<LadyCanary> I have!
<LadyCanary> He's so silly :3
<mario_pony> CupcakeWarrior: it's from the cartoons!
<emangamer> dat chuggaconroy
<CCCP> i love his lets plays
<Dark__Horst> cupcake, this is the transformers theme
<emangamer> I stopped liking Chuggaconroy after his LPs stopped becoming LPs and became walkthroughs
<Shizuka> 13http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Why%3F&lk=2
<CupcakeWarrior> LPs are basically walkthroughs
<CCCP> emangamer: i havn't seen any of his new stuff
<mario_pony> i looved dark bowser he looked awesome!
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<mario_pony> the koopa kids were also cool in super mario bros 3
<Eulshy> and now i go to work on chapter 8, i bid you ponies farewell for now, as i assume i should be able to reingauge you later and if not, i bid the goodnight
<mario_pony> hi Midnight_Tempest
<CCCP> mario_pony: they had a bigger role in Super Mario World imo
<emangamer> I REALLY like mario and luigi superstar saga
<CCCP> ^
<NullRadix> damnit... stupid boss hit me, and it didn't have enough hits left for me to get the stars back from bounced red eggs...
<mario_pony> CCCP: yeah i know
<Ocean> Pokemon?
<GrimGallop> Did I just hear Pokemon?
<Ocean> Aww.
<LadyCanary> YES.
<mario_pony> CCCP: but i loved super mario bros 3 more

<LadyCanary> Oh wells.
<mario_pony> emangamer: me too
<Dark__Horst> x-men
<CCCP> mario_pony: both games are tied for me
<LadyCanary> This guitar makes Canary a happy girl :3
<TrixieMuffin> If you like Transformers , you should listen to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5U8ho40YFo&feature=related the Ballad of Optimus Prime
<nekohime> who are we listening to?
<Wrek> 05i loved this show as a kid
<Dark__Horst> band's powerglove
<CupcakeWarrior> Apparently a pony is a unit of measure
<Midnight_Tempest> the old 90's x-men was awesome
<LadyCanary> This is Powerglove?!
<mario_pony> NullRadix: what are you playing?
<Jim> A measure of awesomeness
<NullRadix> Yoshi's Island
<nekohime> thanks, gonna look them up
<CuddlyKittens11> sup bronystate.
<NullRadix> I know this song...
<NullRadix> oh right, x-men
<Jim> ohai CuddlyKittens11
<LadyCanary> Is this Powerglove?! THE WHOLE TIME?!
<flutter_spin> My bro was a Transformers fan. I think I was too late to get into it
<emangamer> LadyCanary: I love the powerglove, its so bad
<mario_pony> hi CuddlyKittens11 what is you favorite super mario villain?
<LadyCanary> =_=
<LadyCanary> As in the band, dumdum.
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<CuddlyKittens11> mario_pony: Never really had a fancy for mario actually.
<CuddlyKittens11> mario_pony: might be able to come up with one if you give me time
*mario_pony heartbreaks
<flutter_spin> And I never read the Xmen/DC/Spiderman comics. Funny that I first learned about them through the tv series
<Midnight_Tempest> Powerglove as band, awesome... powerglove as controller -_- why...
<LadyCanary> ^
<LadyCanary> Powerglove ist sexy.
<Midnight_Tempest> this is awesome... got a craving for the Protomen now
<CuddlyKittens11> mario_pony: the most any "Mario Game," that I ever played was Mario Tennis (for the GBC), which barely featured Mario at all
<Wrek> 05i have a craving for..
<Wrek> 05.
<flutter_spin> And if you really wanted to know - Prof Xavier is my favorite xman
<mario_pony> CuddlyKittens11: but but mario.....it was.....it was awesome!
<CuddlyKittens11> mario_pony: infact, he was sort of the "grand nemisis," in the game
<LadyCanary> For what Wrek?
<Wrek> 05a LNS with my daily vlogs
<CuddlyKittens11> mario_pony: therefore... Mario is my favorite Mario villian
<RAWRity> "We hate your politics, we hate your problems, and we hate the way you smell, 1 2 3!"

<mario_pony> stomp stomp clap
<LadyCanary> <3 I love you Wrek.
<GrimGallop> o.o
<Meeplord> I now love you @Wrek
<CuddlyKittens11> Part of me feels like Sascha Beran Cohen might be the only one who can play freddy mercury.
<Jim> Painis
<unfoundbug> butt
<CuddlyKittens11> secks
<RAWRity> CuddlyKittens11: that part of you is completely wrong.

<Meeplord> PAINIS IN THE AINUS
<RoseyPony> lulz
<CCCP> wish i was onthis roadtrip http://derpy.me/zlwSf
<mario_pony> scary butt fun
<Meeplord> RD VERSION!
<RAWRity> Baron Cohen can only play assholes. Freddie Mercury was many things, but he was not an asshole. Nor did he ever throw an urn of ashes onto Ryan Seacrest.
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> i don't CCCP
<GrimGallop> I don't think I'd want Derpy driving
<GrimGallop> :P
<CuddlyKittens11> RAWRity: Yeah, but have you ever seen him sing?
<Meeplord> xD

<CCCP> wuts the name of this song?
<unfoundbug> OH MY GOSH
<unfoundbug> OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH
<Moshakra> oh my gosh....
<Moshakra> you know, 20 times 0 is still 0.
<Jim> heh
<Meeplord> Sit on you - Tim and eric @Wrek ?
<unfoundbug> 20% more is 1.2 times extra
<unfoundbug> not 20
<Moshakra> And 1.2 times 0 is 0.
<Moshakra> Yeah, once simplified
<SilverStreak> I DIVIDE MY 0
<CCCP> Lags make me mad
<Meeplord> it would make my day :)
<unfoundbug> however, RD does add extra coolness
*GrimGallop implodes
<unfoundbug> before the 20%
<Moshakra> RD just ADDs coolness
<Moshakra> there was none before
<unfoundbug> the pony coolness increase
<PinkiePieCopy> Hai guys

<flutter_spin> Still won't beat Twilight catgroove

<otakon> Moshakra: but at least it's not speaking in fancy
<PinkiePieCopy> Everypony elses too
<Moshakra> =3
<emangamer> RAWRity: too bad clash of the titans had almost nothing to do with canon greek mythology
<otakon> :)
<Midnight_Tempest> the stream is offline... there isnt anything wrong with it
<PinkiePieCopy> I'm buffered
<Meeplord> im not :(
<BritishBrony> ?
<otakon> emangamer: eeyup, but it was FUN!! The original, not the crap remake
<flutter_spin> play you! play!
<mario_pony> is there a stream?
<RAWRity> emangamer: "Coming up next week on The Adventures of Captain Obvious...."
<kenne> stream down now? awww

<mario_pony> RAWRity: lol
<BritishBrony> Good Morning. 2am to be exact,
<RAWRity> otakon: yfw a sequel to the remake is coming in a couple months.
<RAWRity> emangamer: it's not. at all.
<mario_pony> RAWRity: a sequel to what?
<PinkiePieCopy> I played 2 hours of terraria and 1 hour of Gmod
<otakon> RAWRity: ohgods WHY!?
<CCCP> What if in the future People think that Bronies were an anchient civilization and we worshiped Celestia as the sun god and Luna as the moon god. Discord was the devil.
<flutter_spin> Wrath of the Titans
<RAWRity> mario_pony: Clash of the Titans remake
<PinkiePieCopy> Rise and shine, Mr.Freeman.....
<RAWRity> otakon: because money.
<otakon> CCCP: that would be neat
<mario_pony> RAWRity: YES!!!
<unfoundbug> CCCP, then they will know the truth
<otakon> RAWRity: I don't like it
<RAWRity> mario_pony: yes? That thing sucked donkey ass
<RoboGerbil> http://www.gamespot.com/news/dungeons-and-dragons-online-expansion-hits-june-25-6351094
<PinkiePieCopy> CCCP: Bronies would still exist, but that would be cool
<kenne> ill brb when something happens
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> if discord is the devil then i choose to be satanic
<mario_pony> RAWRity: you suck donkey ass
<CCCP> PinkiePieCopy: true
<RoboGerbil> seems DDO finally got the hint and theyre adding the druid
<GrimGallop> What's this? A DDO expansion? Are they finally going to add GNOMES?!
<Moshakra> CCCP
<RAWRity> and I know damn well "Wrath of the Titans" is going to suck just as much redundant ass.
<flutter_spin> Clash reminded me of Transformers - plenty of action shots, characters just jammed together to make a story
<otakon> RoboGerbil: huzzah! now if I could only get my gamepad to work with it
<CCCP> Moshakra:

<flutter_spin> oh. I was going to say Bronies United Chunga... and then I just ran out of ideas
<BrownCowDie> Hey guys
<otakon> but I've only been a brony for a few months
<BritishBrony> Mope.
<flutter_spin> I've watched all the videos of bronycon. Does that count?
<Saturn> 08,01i didn't get a newsletter yet :(

<Jim> That's a win, that's a brony-singing-theme-song win
<Jim> Roll the next clip Stephen!
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> 21...holy shit, its nine o'clock already
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Ld2T4sTYg&feature=related second best bronycon moment
<MakerDusk> I know right
<MakerDusk> where did the day go
<Moshakra> lucccku
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> my day was spent in a very boring spring factory
<Dark__Horst> stream gone?
<CCCP> Is bronycon worth going to?
<Moshakra> eeyip
<Moshakra> YES
<Moshakra> YES IT IS
<Moshakra> IF YOU CAN GO YOU ARE LUCKY
<mario_pony> yep Saturn i just saw it again and it says you name right there
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> listening to someone who doesn't know how to shut up, 9 hours seems more like 18 at that point
<kenne> aww man vid went silent on the bass canon
<mario_pony> how about a song?
<Moshakra> PIIINKIE YOU GOTTA
<Moshakra> STAND UP TALL
<Moshakra> LEARN TO FACE YOUR FEAARS
<Wrek> 05lessen the allcaps
<Moshakra> I believe you are reffering to my ROYAL CANTERLOT SINGING VOICE
<mario_pony> ^
<Moshakra> *swuee* :$
<flutter_spin> Those 2 moments were what I liked. I did like hearing a little FAQ from the VAs. The hug was kind of weird. The episode was weird. Fighting is Magic was a neat promotion they threw in. So was Equestria Online (3d style).
<mario_pony> how about some bass canon?
<mario_pony> just a sec
<otakon> flutter_spin: um, we are BRONIES! We are the STANDARD of weird at this point. And I'm damn proud of it.
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u0t8ZIlwuQ
<mario_pony> Power up the bass canon....
<mario_pony> FIRE!!!
<mario_pony> were is evrypony?
<Jim> hiding
<Jim> *shifty eyes*
*Jim hides
<Dark__Horst> am i the only one that thinks this basscannon thing is way overrated?
<GrimGallop> Hiding from dubstep x.x
<mario_pony> dubstep rules!!!!!!
<StewedLeeks> moo
<Aircrafter> <--- Is thinking of space is 20 percent cooler video because of the screen picture
<mario_pony> salvation is reserved for those who pass the test,
<GrimGallop> Dubstep is horribly overrated ear rape.
<flutter_spin> I guess the 3rd one was when the VA says "Well fluttershy is sweet and kind sounding... AND PINKIES CRAZY" and that is when I flipped in knowing she does both voices
<mario_pony> you are ear rape!!
<Dark__Horst> sure, there'S good dubstep, but this one is.... meh
<Dark__Horst> very much so
<flutter_spin> I was going to link it, but I didn't want to dig for it
<mario_pony> flutter_spin: which video?
<flutter_spin> at bronycon
<flutter_spin> If you really want me to find it, it might take me a few minutes
<mario_pony> oh i saw it already
<CCCP> is the stream still up?
*mario_pony tries to make dubstep with mouth
<Jim> eeenope
<StewedLeeks> still nobody :/

<BrownCowDie> scratch that- http://youtu.be/bpIirUf74H4

<flutter_spin> For some reason I wanted to avoid saying that, since the video buffer is still stuck on tha tpic
<Jim> Brave looks rather interesting
<Dark__Horst> and the scotts! SO MANY SCOTTS!
<Zappy> I know. I just wanted to point it out.
<Jim> I like scotts, so that's ok
<Tovler> Oh no. Women are figuring out there is a war against women.
<Dark__Horst> i love the accent
<flutter_spin> It reminds me of How to Train a Dragon for some reason
<mario_pony> i have officialy listened to reflection 10 times
<flutter_spin> and THAT was a good movie too
<Jim> How to train your ginger
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp_-sgX0M0I

<miJ> Does he mention us there?
<CCCP> yes
<miJ> heh, neat
<Gunthler> i found out watching the chat reaction vids
*miJ flips

<Cypresswolf> Should have kept the fight style from 1, you could still have dual casting, but a dozens of combinations to flip through
<inquisitor> I found bronystate from equestriadaily
<herp-a-derp> found out from bronies reaction to derpy
<Gunthler> ^

<KernelCobb> just logged on, what do you write?
<Eulshy> fanfics
<Cypresswolf> Fable 4, I like to see a longer range of time passing than 50 years. Also a return of the regions of the original Fable - Hook Coast, Witchwood, & the artic region where you fight Jack of Blades dragon form in TLC
<KernelCobb> neat
<KernelCobb> link?
<mario_pony> mmmm mom just brought wendy's

<KernelCobb> see what i did thar? spelin
<Eulshy> http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487630/1/bMLP_b_bFriendship_b_is_bEdged_b
<Eulshy> it gets better
<flutter_spin> I really enjoy seeing reactions, since I seem to miss out on a lot of the details in an episode. It also makes it more enjoyable to pretend you are watching with them.
<flutter_spin> But fanfics I just don't quite get. I haven't read a single one.
<Gunthler> ^
<Eulshy> It's usually just somethig for me to do
<Eulshy> keeps me from minding my depressin
<PinkiePieCopy> My internet connection is majorly derping
<Eulshy> which i just rememnered
<Eulshy> sigh

<mario_pony> LadyCanary: good luck
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary: if you don't, one day you might move away, and have to stay somewhere you hate for 4 years while you do a computer science degree at a crap university
<flutter_spin> NO! Made me remember - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBny9H8Yd2I
<LadyCanary> So much ping.
<Eulshy> trust me being aloof is the best strategy for friend making and dating
<LadyCanary> NOOOOOO he's invisible on FB now TT_TT
<herp-a-derp> he he, facebook
<mario_pony> LadyCanary: demand that he talk to you!
<BronyCon> yo
<mario_pony> BronyCon: yo
<KernelCobb> Eulshy: only works if your friend/love interest isn't also aloof
<TopHat> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary: the worst that can happen is he could epxlode, then you could explode, then everyone explodes again
<Saturn> 08,01and that's really unlikekly
<TopHat> fuck off science
<LadyCanary> Well I exploded twice.
<KernelCobb> seems legit
<Eulshy> KernalCobb it's worked on everyone at my school

<Cypresswolf> *survives 17 minutes of G 3.6 Scootaloo* Oh YEEEAAAH http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBt_aKXXtmo&feature=related
<otakon> NewDCD: do it filly!
<KernelCobb> Kernel* and referring to a book titled "The Celestine Prophecy", aloof is an "attention grabbing" method devised specifically for "interrogators"
<Saturn> 08,01NewDCD: you could at least take her out to dinner first
<LadyCanary> XD
<herp-a-derp> Cypresswolf, NOW DO IT AGAIN!
<KernelCobb> In english, aloof works with people that want to know everything
<MaryJman> :P WHASUP BRONIES
<Eulshy> Eul is refering to being distant and secluded and letting people come to you
<flutter_spin> Saturn, are you staring into my soul? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfUnn4CJpds
<KernelCobb> not letting, nearly forcing
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03... bathroom music?
<KernelCobb> they can't help but be interested in you because you will not let them know anything about you

<LadyCanary> <3
<herp-a-derp> OH GOD, THE INTRO
<herp-a-derp> IT MAKES NO SENSE
*LadyCanary feels like self whoran.
<KernelCobb> Eulshy: once they feel they know you, they will lose interest in you. The only way to keep them interested is to not let them into your life in any way as long as possible. That is not a very healthy way to hold a relationship with anyone.
<RoseyPony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzX7unM9Lfw&feature=related

<RoflBot> DAT TRU
<IngloriousPony89> What's up mah bronies?
<StinkomanFan> I just wasted FIFTEEN FRIGGING MINUTES facing some terrible, terrible demon and I come back to people ignoring me!
<StinkomanFan> :|
<Eulshy> KernalCobb it's how i've been holding all of mine for the past year, when someone takes a genuine interest then they get let in
<KernelCobb> Eulshy: that also means that the only way to keep them is to let them into your life, causing them to lose interest, resulting in a breakup
<BronyinJapan> lol

<CCCP> HI BronyinJapan
<StinkomanFan> Now, I saw both versions of G1, G3, G3.6, and G4 give me G3.5 It can't even measure on the level of Scootaloo bouncing around the room for 4 to 5 minutes
<IngloriousPony89> 96.5% more WUB WUB
<RoflBot> cant wait for a gazillionier more guns
<KernelCobb> i got me a drawing tablet, everypony, and i need some feed back on this doodle i did right after i opened it

<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftlnjf5l4hU I'm just going to throw that out for those who haven't seen it
<StinkomanFan> I had an idea
<LadyCanary> Well now Im doing the nosebleed.
<StinkomanFan> Pinkie Pie gets the Mask
<MahBoi777> tissue?
<StinkomanFan> What happens?
<RaveBrony> SssssssmOken!
<mario_pony> they ruined the mask with the second one
<IngloriousPony89> Oh God WoW. So many memories :D
<Ingwaz> http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/060/b/b/fluttershy_origins_by_csimadmax-d4rekq6.png
<Ingwaz> HNNNNNNG
<RaveBrony> Pinkie Pie doesnt already wear the mask!?!? Oh god o.o
<flutter_spin> We do not accept the fact there was a "second" one
<mario_pony> Ingwaz: my heart exploded
<flutter_spin> Same reason why we do not accept Mulan had a sequel
<mario_pony> ^
<LadyCanary> SHUSH
<LadyCanary> THAT DIDNT EXIST.
<flutter_spin> what didn't exist :P
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: cud u imagine Pinkie with the mask? oh gawd
<Krakass> Nor the Matrix
<RaveBrony> Ikr?? :D
<mario_pony> just like the super mario bros mov.....ooppps
<LadyCanary> Actually, the Nostalgia Chick did a top 10 worst Disney Sequels.
<Polydunami> Dang it, why do I like Rarity? I didn't like her when I first got into this show
<RaveBrony> Huh, i never thot of Fluttershy's parents O.o
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<StinkomanFan> ;) Rarity is sexiest poni
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<otakon> no
<mario_pony> super mario bros the movie
<StinkomanFan> Next to Spitfire and Braeburn
<mario_pony> ?me shivers
<otakon> NO TALK OF SEXY and PONY in same sentence!
*mario_pony shivers
<IngloriousPony89> Why are we saying that ponies are sexy in the first place?
<CupcakeWarrior> Actually Rainbow Dash is sexiest pony
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: that was awful
<RaveBrony> Weve seen Twilight's, Pinkie's and Rarity's parents O.o
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: I don't know
<IngloriousPony89> ...but RD is sexiest pony
<mario_pony> MahBoi777: ikr
<RaveBrony> Spike was kiddnapped i guess
<Polydunami> I'm not one to classify ponies based on attractiveness
<RaveBrony> ^
<MahBoi777> ^^
<RaveBrony> ^^^
<MahBoi777> ^^^^
<flutter_spin> I think everyone agrees that Rarity is the most complex pony and the most mysterious. It is why we love her.
<otakon> RaveBrony: but not AJ's or Flutters......I'm worried.
<Polydunami> ... Yeah...
<Ingwaz> RD is definitely not sexiest pony
<StinkomanFan> Twilight Sparkle is Spike's mom
<RaveBrony> Yeah O.o
<StinkomanFan> DUH
<CupcakeWarrior> lies
<otakon> flutter_spin: um maybe. I've certainly come to like her more now
<operatorpony> Hello
<mario_pony> they need an episode were they meet eachothers parents that would be fun.
<operatorpony> the vdieo isnt loading for me
<RaveBrony> AJ... must not have parents anymore D: Fluttershy.... disappears as a filly and nobody cares?...RD O.o
<Ingwaz> apparnetly lauren fausts original intentions for AJ's parents is that they were dead i believe
<flutter_spin> I will still side with the more sexy = not sexy, but I find her very random like Pinkie sometimes.
<StinkomanFan> Cue Fluttershy's parents being a Pro Wrestler and an Announcer, respectively
<mario_pony> who you gonna call?
<RaveBrony> :(
<mario_pony> GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
<RaveBrony> ^lol
<StinkomanFan> OH YEAH FLUTTERS YOU NEVER SHOWED ME YOUR LITTLE FREINDS
<Ingwaz> StinkomanFan: i actually read a fanfic that had fluttershy's mom as some massive pegasus brute that was a royal guardsman
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<RaveBrony> Brb, i need something to eat x_x
<operatorpony> WHy video no play for me???
<Krakass> Because there is no stream
<flutter_spin> Naw. There was an interview somewhere. I think they said that Applejack parents are traveling around the earth to find seeds like Granny Smith
<StinkomanFan> Voiced by Hulk Hogan and that old chick from the Red Carpet thingies
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: i've never heard of that interview
*LadyCanary swoons with joy
<otakon> StinkomanFan: I saw a comic where Flutters dad was imagined as basically a loud but well meaning stallion version of Rainbow Dash
<TrixieMuffin> Obviously Fluttershy's parents are in the SH.....
<CupcakeWarrior> Have you ever noticed how much no one likes AppleJack?
<BronyinJapan> fuck i hate TSA
<flutter_spin> I don't think its "official" but there was a discussion
<Gunthler> :L
*Polydunami likes Applejack...
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: I like her
<Ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: i like applejack
<otakon> it's she's the most grounded pony
<Ingwaz> pinkie pie is best pony, everypony else is second best pony
<otakon> she's got ............
<CupcakeWarrior> AppleJack is worst pony for me
<otakon> horse sense
<IngloriousPony89> Yes Cupcake I have. My friend said that AppleJack was her favorite pony, but recently she switched to Rarity
<StinkomanFan> No wonder AJ was the Mare-Do-Well HER PARENTS ARE DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
<mario_pony> when theres an invicible man sleeping in your bed who you gonna call?
<Polydunami> Dang it, Applejack has no emoticon :[
<mario_pony> the cops!
<CupcakeWarrior> Origionally Twilight was best pony, now its RD
<Tovler> Applejack was my favorite, but I'm getting a little bored of her.
<otakon> Polydunami: yh, she has no love
<otakon> also
<Ingwaz> besides, AJ trolled celestia
<Krakass> Gilda is best Pony
<otakon> Celestia needs more love!
<otakon> she does
<StinkomanFan> IDK AJ got 3 eps this season
<Polydunami> Indeed
*Ingwaz slaps Krakass
<otakon> everyone calls her a tyrant and a troll and a deviant.
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: I just noticed that (>_(\
<Swordsman> Hello
<CupcakeWarrior> Ingwaz: That IS pretty badass I suppose
<otakon> hiya Swordsman
<RaveBrony> They need a Celestia episode, where She learns something :D
<Polydunami> Hello there Swordsman ^__^
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> RaveBrony: now THAT would be good
<Krakass> Dear Me, today I learned...
<Ingwaz> RaveBrony: then she wouldnt be the God-King
<CupcakeWarrior> RaveBrony: Who would she write to at the end?
<Swordsman> I am pretty new to IRC but I figureed out how to get here on a client so I guess that's pretty good
<StinkomanFan> Celestia is not that bad, she just seems a bit too busy to deal with all of Ponyville's problems
<IngloriousPony89> Hey guys, I have an announcement: My friend, who was a devote pony hater, recently joined the herd.
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: she would write to Twilight
*emangamer hugs SlurryMoon
<otakon> IngloriousPony89: hurray! show them in, we have CIDER!
<Ingwaz> StinkomanFan: she doesnt seem like shes too busy, rather that she trusts her subjects to handle things and learn from them
<RaveBrony> Twilight! you know? i nice Apprentice better than the master episode kind of thing? :D
<Polydunami> Okay, that is so ironic it's funny
<otakon> hiya SlurryMoon
<Polydunami> :D
<Swordsman> I want to go to #brony but I'm only 16 :(
<RaveBrony> ??
<Polydunami> Oh my...
<operatorpony> guys, the video wont load for me. is nothing being streamed?
<StinkomanFan> "Dear Twilight Sparkle, today we had a new recruit to the force and he USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST
<IngloriousPony89> By #brony you mean Bronycon?
<Tovler> Bronycon?
<RaveBrony> What is that?
<September> #brony is a channel.
<RaveBrony> ^wut?
<Swordsman> No I meant the #brony IRC channel
<StinkomanFan> +18 and up babby!
<Swordsman> It says 18+
<September> Bronycon is a literal convention for bronies.
<otakon> yh
<otakon> it's +18
<otakon> do NOT go into it
<MahBoi777> oh gawd...
<otakon> if you are not prepared for NSFW
<StinkomanFan> Lyra's over there
<RaveBrony> Oooook, how do i leave a channel then?
<mario_pony> why too late
<Krakass> Well now I'm intrigued.
<otakon> RaveBrony: use /quit
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: RUN
<otakon> or right click the channel
<September> EW Otakon does that mean its a room for the cloppers?
<Polydunami> I'm never intrigued by 18+
<otakon> September: yeah
<Polydunami> And I turn 22 on Pinkie Pie day
<Swordsman> At least I TOTALLY don't want to go to #stupidsexytwilight (scrunch face)
<September> ohgawdew.
<StinkomanFan> I'm a clopper but I'm still here
<Swordsman> No seriously I don't think I'd like it there
<otakon> Swordsman: no outside chat links please
<RaveBrony> Ok, good
<otakon> I have popped in from time to time
<RaveBrony> Does anypony actually talk in that channel? O.o
<otakon> they aren't a bad bunch
<Swordsman> Otakon- how do I knew what that meant?
<flutter_spin> Here we go... taken from the FAQ page
<flutter_spin> inc text
<flutter_spin> Q: Where are Applejack's parents?To put it bluntly, we just never figured it out. I just liked the feeling of them living with their Granny, but keeping the family dynamic tight and small. To be honest, I would like to simply say that they passed away somehow, but it's just it would have likely been deemed too sad for a kids' show and I don't think it would have ever been approved. There was brief discussion of them being t
<StinkomanFan> So, how about something poni poni poni
<otakon> Swordsman: bc it's #
<MahBoi777> good lord, so many freaky channels, lol
<Swordsman> Brb, I should probably go read a FAQ of some sort
<otakon> yh
<otakon> Swordsman: the rules would be good
<otakon> also, one rule they STILL HAVEN'T PUT IN THE MAIN PAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> Spoilers of ANY KIND=BAN
<Polydunami> You know, Sesame Street had an episode about death
<Krakass> No talking about bronystate?
<NullRadix> no cupcakes?
<MahBoi777> whuzzat?
<LadyCanary> Nope.
<Ingwaz> actually, i'm pretty sure thats in the rules otakon
<otakon> LadyCanary!
*otakon hugs LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Yes....
<mario_pony> that place was weird
<StinkomanFan> Ash's dad was the same way in the Pokemon Fandom, theories ranged from Arceus to Mewtwo to even his own mother
<otakon> Ingwaz: nope I have checked
<RaveBrony> Youre so right, otakon
<otakon> there is NO mention of Spoilers=Ban
<Polydunami> And we've actually seen a funeral in the show itself
<Krakass> StinkomanFan, so Ash's dad was like Cartman's?
<otakon> lol
<Polydunami> For three seconds, yes
<StinkomanFan> In theory yes
<otakon> Krakass: you mean his mom?
<Ingwaz> and do not spoil the movie for others
<Krakass> Yup
<Ingwaz> taken from the rule page
<NullRadix> The funeral is there, it is NOT explicitly called out
<Eulshy> Before i go to bed. I lost the game.
<MahBoi777> who was it that got banned for spoilers? I forgot.
<mario_pony> well goodnight everypony it was fun!
<otakon> Ingwaz: no, it means ANY kind of spoiler
<operatorpony> :( video still isnt playing, IM depressed and want Ponies
<NullRadix> Just like AJ's parents aren't there, but the fact isn't explicitly called out
<Krakass> Night Mario.
<otakon> MahBoi777: I remember when it happened
<Ingwaz> i'm aware otakon
<MahBoi777> gnight mario_pony
<Polydunami> Right, but it's still there
<NullRadix> later mario_pony
<otakon> night mario_pony sleep well
<IngloriousPony89> night mario_pony
<CupcakeWarrior> Maybe AJ is AJ's parents...
<otakon> Shizuka: you still there dear?
<IngloriousPony89> Paradox?
<operatorpony> opera
<Tovler> Ash's Dad should be the Pokemon Champion in the Black and White 2.
<Shizuka> 13eeeeeeeyup
<StinkomanFan> Sweetie Belle interupts a funeral to point out the minister I'm fairly sure IT'S AN EFFING FUNERAL
<MahBoi777> turret opera
<CupcakeWarrior> It would be like a soap opera
<Polydunami> There is a coffin there
<otakon> Shizuka: just wondering, sorry to bother you, go back to being an awesome ninja of lurkiness
<MahBoi777> where??
<IngloriousPony89> It is kinda odd that there was a funeral there during a happy song
<Swordsman> "We have ways of knowing if you are Ban evading" - Bronystate confirmed for secret intelligence agency
<Eulshy> Lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game lost the game
<otakon> MahBoi777: far right of the shot
<NullRadix> but it's not explicitly called out, it's just there, and it's not like it's a Grim Reaper or a murder
<RaveBrony> Damn it!
*Midnight_Tempest rolls around on the ground aimlessly
<CupcakeWarrior> What would happen if The Game itself loses the game?
<IngloriousPony89> Eulshy: Why? Just... why?
<otakon> hiya Midnight_Tempest how you feeling today?
<MahBoi777> play the Benny Hill theme at a funeral and let the chaos unfold
<otakon> also, I don't play The Game
<otakon> I play That Game
<otakon> and I never lose That Game
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rToK2i9hGNI
<NullRadix> We should play Calvin Ball
<Eulshy> IngloriousPony89 spreading the love
<CupcakeWarrior> That Game is The Game's less fun cousin
<IngloriousPony89> CupcakeWarrior: That be like dividing by zero. Dont even think about it. To dangerous
<RaveBrony> Well im going to head to bed everypony! As always, take care and have fun!! Cya tomorrow :)
<Krakass> Bye RaveBrony
<StinkomanFan> I like the song by Queen that goes PLAYTHEGAMEPLAYTHEGAMEPLAYTHEGAME and has synthosizers'
<NullRadix> later RaveBrony
<RoflBot> GOOD NIGHT DONT LET MOLESTIA BITE
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: you smell that? smells like... fire... *bursts into flames*
<MahBoi777> gnight RaveBrony! take care
<otakon> noes!
<Polydunami> Go to sleep RaveBrony ^__^
*otakon puts out Midnight_Tempest
<IngloriousPony89> Night RaveBrony
<otakon> night RaveBrony sleep well
<CupcakeWarrior> I am convinced that Midnight_Tempest is a fire demon
<StinkomanFan> I don't fear Molestia at night
*RaveBrony waves bye to everypony :$
<otakon> RoflBot: or do, if your into that sort of thing.....
*NullRadix grabs Midnight_Tempest and throws him under the soda machine, pushing ALL the buttons
<otakon> bye~
<Swordsman> Why are the definitions of "A" and "B" movies in the rules? Were they a source of constant arguing cloging up the channels?
*IngloriousPony89 waves back
<StinkomanFan> I fear her in the dat
<flutter_spin> I remembered something! I was going to watch the latest episode of Alcatraz
<Polydunami> CupcakeWarriot, who you calling a demon?
<Midnight_Tempest> CupcakeWarrior: Flame Atronach... lol skyrim
<otakon> Swordsman: it's kind of a flexible thing
<Polydunami> Dang typo
<otakon> guys, brb gonna play a match of ME3 MP
<flutter_spin> lol. I can't get enough of ME3 MP
<Swordsman> I just wondered why such a subject was covered in the rules
<Polydunami> Break a leg
<Gunthler> lol this is me "Yay imma get a full nights of sleep!" BronyState & Youtube: "NOPE."
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: I thought he just likes to spontaneously combust but fire demon is good too
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... still a week till ME3... >_<
<Swordsman> So, uh, anyone here play Cube 2?
<emangamer> alright everyone I'm going to sleep
<StinkomanFan> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 2 days, 13 hours, 21 minutes, 24 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<CupcakeWarrior> ME3?
<emangamer> night everyone
<Krakass> The problem I have with the ME3 MP is that it's going to all reset when you get the real game.
<MahBoi777> gnight emangamer
<IngloriousPony89> Still a week till the Silent Hill HD Collection
<nonnaCytraP> emangamer: night :)
<flutter_spin> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<CupcakeWarrior> 2 DAYS!
<IngloriousPony89> And cya emangamer
<Krakass> Night emangamer
<RainbowJack> 2 days YAY
<NullRadix> g'night emangamer!... and I think I missed a few others...
<IngloriousPony89> Silent Hill HD Collection > ME3
<StinkomanFan> I thought it was released in May Inglourias
<Swordsman> Me3?
<flutter_spin> Silent Hill probably be too scary for me
<flutter_spin> Mass Effect 3
*emangamer has felt really left out these past few days
<Swordsman> Oh, Mass Effect 3, am i right?
<flutter_spin> They came out with a demo
<Swordsman> I just guessed that after asking
<Polydunami> So the new broadcast time for Friendship is Magic is what again?
<emangamer> 1pm est
<RainbowJack> Dead Island looks cool
<Polydunami> Right
<IngloriousPony89> Yup Swordsman
<flutter_spin> There are a ton of reasons why people HATE talking about Mass Effect 3, but its good enough on its own
<CupcakeWarrior> Sweet thats 10 am for me
<StinkomanFan> COLNOL SHEPARD'S WACKY SPACE ADVENTURES
<Polydunami> Indeed
<Swordsman> I'm currently working on a method for determining the area of irregular shapes
<MahBoi777> I wonder how good Dead Island is
<Krakass> Calculus?
<IngloriousPony89> RainbowJack: Yeah but it's nowhere as good as it could of been
<emangamer> Swordsman: its call a tub of water
<StinkomanFan> Geometry Wars?
<Gunthler> fluttershy being a tree = fanon or canon?
<MahBoi777> canon
<StinkomanFan> Both@
<RoflBot> fanon
<flutter_spin> http://klarnetist.deviantart.com/#/d4plwf9
<Swordsman> I don't know. I might either be independently re-inventing calculus, or inventing an alternative to it
<Polydunami> Fluttershy would LIKE to be a tree
<NullRadix> fluttershy said she wanted to be a tree; anything where she IS a tree is fanon (FO:E and Past Sins are two examples)
<Swordsman> emangamer- that's for volume, Professor
<StinkomanFan> I miss the Smash fandom, writing and reading about the Smash Mansion was so much fun
<MahBoi777> flutter_spin: well that settles it
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQiAHjXa74 (for reference)
<StinkomanFan> Even got a mention on Wikipedia's artical for Fanon we did
<StinkomanFan> I wonder if it's still there
<StinkomanFan> But enough about my old bros
<StinkomanFan> How are you guys
<Polydunami>
*NullRadix shrugs
<Swordsman> Good
<MahBoi777> I'm still waitin for Indian Stallone to become a meme
<CupcakeWarrior> If Fluttershy is a tree, then any piece of paper could be made from her
<IngloriousPony89> Pretty good StinkomanFan
<flutter_spin> http://i43.tinypic.com/2pyt1dl.jpg
<NullRadix> Can't complain, the situation I got myself stuck in is madness, and I knew it was madness before I did it, but I did it...
<StinkomanFan> MANLY
*RainbowJack hugs Mahboi777
<MahBoi777> LOL
<MahBoi777> ohai RainbowJack

<Polydunami> Well? What's the significance?
<RainbowJack> CupcakeWarrior i like derpy hooves day more
<StinkomanFan> I mean we still have the original footage of Derpy, it's not like we lost every shred of her
<RainbowJack> my friend like her alot
<Gunthler> Shes not a tree Dashie xD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSLvjfrxynA
<Gunthler> Dashie <3
<IngloriousPony89> Canon Derpy is still Derpy I do believe
<MahBoi777> there has to be an episode where FS becomes a tree now, lol
<Swordsman> Question - Is it against the rules to shamelessly self-advetise by posting a link to my YouTube channel if I don't spam it?
<Swordsman> Or just frowned upon
<flutter_spin> ppfpft. I started reading a document and at the beginning of the paragraph starts "Huzzah!"
<flutter_spin> Secretly a brony me thinks
<MahBoi777> HUZZAH
<RainbowJack> Fluttershy Lament

<Swordsman> Cave Story is so awesome
<CupcakeWarrior> In cave story on dsiware, he says OH YEAH! now

<fillyfillyy|doingHW> hai guys
<StinkomanFan> Besides I plan on buying Stock in Hasbro so you dips best not screw it up for me
<Gunthler> luttershy puts her hoof down in the next episode xD
<Swordsman> I feel like a newfriend for having heard about it only after my sister downloaded a Demo for the Wii
<fillyfillyy|doingHW> im probably gonna be up all night
<Swordsman> Cupcake- same for the Wii
<CupcakeWarrior> Why would you buy Cave Story on Wii and DSI if the game was free in the first place?
<Polydunami> At least you HAVE homework to do
<IngloriousPony89> Ignorance CupcakeWarrior?
<StinkomanFan> Like Meat Boy, it has more stuff in it
<flutter_spin> Thursday. Day off for me. Huzzah. Gotta' do taxes though

<[SWAG]Haku> Le sigh
<LadyCanary> ...Uh oh.
<IngloriousPony89> Also the game. Which you just lost
<[SWAG]Haku> uh oh?
<Swordsman> I immediately was watching Fluttershy claim world championship
<BronyinJapan> Wonder if this going to be the new op http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4By8YHOnILo
<LadyCanary> Competition afoot.
<[SWAG]Haku> So today, I got a girlfried
<[SWAG]Haku> named Celeste
<LadyCanary> WAT

<flutter_spin> I want to see if anyone out there is just as good at fluttershy as http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfri55l_HfM&feature=channel is with Rarity
<StinkomanFan> Haku, a life-sized Celestia cut-out isn't a GF
<[SWAG]Haku> ...
<[SWAG]Haku> Not sure if trolling or not
<StinkomanFan> Even if you ride her
<[SWAG]Haku> Oh, I 'ride' her alright
<tgl1992> Has the stream not been working?
<flutter_spin> no current stream, for like 4 hours?
<LadyCanary> Nope.
<tgl1992> There was none this morning
<BritishBrony> Good morning!
*LadyCanary freaks out. SHEEEEEEET.
<IngloriousPony89> Good morning BritishBrony!
<BritishBrony> Happy Derpy Day!
<StinkomanFan> Almost eleven o clock and here I am talking pones with internet people
<MahBoi777> [SWAG]Haku: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ALsvU50wQ
<IngloriousPony89> How was dat sleep?

<[SWAG]Haku> HAPPY DERPY DAY
<Polydunami> Oh my...
<IngloriousPony89> Derpy day in an hour and 4 minutes for me
<RainbowJack> i would love to have a pony plushie to hug
<StinkomanFan> March First is Derp day...why?

<[SWAG]Haku> I made Bacon Muffins that Ima pass out during school
<BritishBrony> Wouldn't we all.
<flutter_spin> I would like a plushie, but I'm afraid it would look weird for anyone that comes in my room
<BritishBrony> Hey MahBoi777
*Gunthler is falling asleep
<[SWAG]Haku> pi
<StinkomanFan> I have an RD doll, but I don't like to interact with it much...
<Polydunami> BronyState: NOPE
<Gunthler> ^
<[SWAG]Haku> SO....
<Gunthler> ded
<[SWAG]Haku> How was ya'lls days?
<StinkomanFan> Especially after that College Humor video
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: i just bought 6 MLP shirts, and i'm a 6'4" male, i think that probably looks pretty weird
<Gunthler> ded
<Polydunami> Same old boring stuff
<CupcakeWarrior> StinkomanFan: That was actually pretty funy
<[SWAG]Haku> My friend got me a '20 percent cooler shirt'
<Ingwaz> O.O we didnt get a little girl at all....
<[SWAG]Haku> then she returned it
<StinkomanFan> It got... creepy
<CupcakeWarrior> Kiiiiiiiillllll meeeeee
<Ingwaz> the fleshlight thing in the video was just wrong
<[SWAG]Haku> later
<IngloriousPony89> Dont temp me CupcakeWarrior
<BritishBrony> D:
<Ingwaz> the rest of it, i could have taken in stride, that, that was just not right
<MelaPonie> Ingwaz, in what video?
<[SWAG]Haku> CupcakeWarrior Later
<IngloriousPony89> not that I have anything against you
<StinkomanFan> *Close up on a scarred Rarity* "Help me..."
<CupcakeWarrior> That ending was funny
<tgl1992> Are they updating the website?
<[SWAG]Haku> maybe
<Ingwaz> MelaPonie: college humor's comedy video on bronies
<[SWAG]Haku> possibly
<MahBoi777> oh gawd college humor, LOL
<[SWAG]Haku> So ima try and write this fanfic that may never be posted
<MelaPonie> Ingwaz, link?
<[SWAG]Haku> because it may never be finished
<StinkomanFan> "And I'm going to talk to my online girlfreind from Korea."
<flutter_spin> If only they made pony toys like that in the college humor video
<StinkomanFan> That seems a bit forced
<Polydunami> :D
<Ingwaz> MelaPonie: dont have one
<MelaPonie> ahh
<MahBoi777> :D
*LadyCanary is getting the kid she fancies into Guilty Gear X2 music.

<IngloriousPony89> DaringDude: What book ya readin'?

<StinkomanFan> I don't like to think about my toys being alive
<DaringDude> kokoro
<flutter_spin> Hey plankton, can we .... THATS AWESOME
<DaringDude> its a book for english class
<StinkomanFan> Daring Do as a book assignment
<StinkomanFan> Me gusta
<IngloriousPony89> Daringdude: What's the title of the book I mean
*CupcakeWarrior waits for Daring Do to be actual book series

<DaringDude> the title is Kokoro
<Bluestrom_S> Hello bronystate

<Polydunami> BronyState says hello
<DaringDude> ^
<Bluestrom_S> My name is Bluestrom_S and I'm addictate to ponies
<Polydunami> Computer says no
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> flutter_spin i know that feel...
<Placebo> Hi Bluestrom_S
<flutter_spin> It was just so perfect from the video I saw. I don't have homework, but I know many here do
<IngloriousPony89> You too Bluestorm_S? I thought I was the only one!
<Bluestrom_S> did you see the eq post by Amy Keating Rogers?
<Bluestrom_S> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/amy-keating-rogers-response-to-derpy.html#more
<Polydunami> Yep
<CupcakeWarrior> yes
<flutter_spin> Discords milk explodes? ... WHAT? How could I miss that?
<IngloriousPony89> Mmhmm
<Bluestrom_S> can I get a summary?
<Bluestrom_S> I haven't read it yet
<IngloriousPony89> It's not that long Bluestorm_S.
<RoflBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=yymqbgD_PqU
<Tovler> I felt sorry for Ms. Rogers. I don't blame her for changing it.
<Polydunami> tl;dr is for slackers :D
<Bluestrom_S> fair enough :P
<StinkomanFan> I have to write an essay about Jim from Huck Finn, due friday and the frigging teacher wasted half the hour giving people suggestions on there OPENING SENTANCES
<Bluestrom_S> I'm reading it now
<IngloriousPony89> I know your pain StinkomanFan
<Polydunami> You're kidding.
<Polydunami> You're not kidding
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> StinkomanFan dude you don't have to write about a freaking chair
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> a FREAking chair!!!
<flutter_spin> http://veggie55.deviantart.com/gallery/33525968#/d4omcpy
<Polydunami> This chair
<IngloriousPony89> How's that coming along TheGreatAndPowerfulT?
<DaringDude> lol does anyone remember the iron pony competition between AJ and RD
<StinkomanFan> Don't get me wrong, I like Jim. He's a good guy, but it was either him or a bunch of retards. It's not exactly a difficult choice
<Polydunami> Yeah, it was an episode
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't ask ... i have a little close to 2 pages
<Polydunami> Well, PART of an episode
<DaringDude> i saw a comment on the video: Pony Stark is the best iron pony
<Polydunami> Okay, that is funny
<flutter_spin> The most fun I have is watching the reaction videos, especially of those that are blind - chat logs or voiced
<Polydunami> Indeed
<StinkomanFan> I need to know why teachers make things so complicated
<Polydunami> I got here because of the Derpy reaction video
<flutter_spin> When people comment outside of those, it loses its flavor.
<IngloriousPony89> You dont konw complicated until you've meet my Spanish teacher StinkomanFan
<Polydunami> :O
<Swordsman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK02kxc5zu4
<flutter_spin> Senior Elroboto
<Placebo> I have an Aviation teacher that still uses an old school projector.. That's about as far from "Complicated" as it gets.
<IngloriousPony89> She's swtiched up the requirements and standards for a research project several times so far. And we've only began a couple days ago
<flutter_spin> That's ok. My computer programming teacher was my worst teacher. His name was Mr. Mellon. We nicknamed him Mellonhead
<StinkomanFan> You can't "Just read" The Great Gatsby. 'GIVE ME A RECAP ON WHAT COLOR SHIRT TOM WAS WEARING WHEN HE CONFRONTED GATSBY IN CHAPTER 8'
<Tovler> Will you stream the Aquabats show to see what the MLP surprise is?
<CupcakeWarrior> We dont know if that will be this week or not
<StinkomanFan> 'Tell me why TJ Eckleburg is important'
<StinkomanFan> 'Write an alternate ending to the novel'
<Placebo> StinkomanFan: One does not simply "read" The Great Gatsby.
<StinkomanFan> On and ON
<CupcakeWarrior> What is the great gatsby?
<StinkomanFan> A novel
<IngloriousPony89> I've heard of it
<flutter_spin> I'm sorry, I got lost after 'tell me'
<IngloriousPony89> Lost as in lost interest or confused?
<StinkomanFan> It's a novel about the American Dream and why life sucks even when you're rich
<flutter_spin> I think the most interesting thing an English teacher did was have a trial over the Scarlet Letter
<CupcakeWarrior> My english class just got done with Lord of the Flies
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlABSdfuWo&feature=related
<CupcakeWarrior> It was boring as hell
<IngloriousPony89> CupcakeWarrior: I read that book by myself. I actually liked it
<Hazard> ohai
<StinkomanFan> PIGGY DIES
<IngloriousPony89> Ohai Hazard
<CupcakeWarrior> NO WAY!
<Polydunami> Hey there Hazard
<Polydunami> And dang it, I was gonna read that :[
<IngloriousPony89> THERE'S ALSO A PLANE CRASH
<Hazard> charolettes web is hilarious when its abridged XD
<Tovler> A pony with a conch for a cutie mark
<Polydunami> Just kidding
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought Piggy was annoying
<IngloriousPony89> Anypony ever read The Divine Comedy?
<Polydunami> No, but I've heard of it
<Hazard> i thought Piggy was exciting
<StinkomanFan> Anyone ever read The Crucible?
<Polydunami> I couldn't stand Roger
<flutter_spin> You know what I did? Dig up any movie. If not, dig up any spark notes. If not, dig up any summary online. If not, make it all up.
<Hazard> who here has a fanfic?
<CupcakeWarrior> StinkomanFan: No but I have to next year
<IngloriousPony89> Yup StinkomanFan. Had to for school a few months ago
<StinkomanFan> I've got one
<StinkomanFan> Not bad eh inglourious?
<NullRadix> ... Piggy? Miss Piggy?
<StinkomanFan> John is one bad Motha-
<Polydunami> Lord of the Flies Piggy
<NullRadix> oh, Lord of the Flies
<Hazard> speaking of books does anyone have a fanfic?
<IngloriousPony89> Not bad. Also watched the movie tied to it. Also not bad for the type of book-to-movie movie
<StinkomanFan> I wrote a fanfic and am writing one now
<Hazard> movieception
*CupcakeWarrior is reminded of the upcoming Hunger Games movie now
<Hazard> as am i StinkomanFan
<Hazard> whats urs called?!
*IngloriousPony89 has never read the Hunger Games, nor is interested
<TopHat> now that I've got you right where I want you......
<TopHat> I'd like to buy all of your chocolate
<StinkomanFan> 'The Next Conversion'
<StinkomanFan> A sequel to my last fanfic, but only in name :|
<flutter_spin> You know what got me super upset in school? The one book I would have LOVED to read was never assigned: The Hobbit
<IngloriousPony89> TopHat: :O
*Hazard reels in a unmentionable toy on a fishing line "Ohai look at this!"
<CupcakeWarrior> TopHat: *shits chocolate bricks*
<Bluestrom_S> Hey SuperBrony64 you online?
<IngloriousPony89> He might be trying to sleep! Shhh!
<Hazard> hey StinkomanFan Would you make me a sandwich?
<StinkomanFan> I hate that I have to read two books at once in order to pass my class
<flutter_spin> But anywhere from Scarlet Letter, Iliad, Crime & Punishment, Pelican Brief --- I seriously just went online for a summary
<StinkomanFan> No Hazard
<Hazard> XD
<StinkomanFan> NO
<StinkomanFan> BAD DAG
<StinkomanFan> *DOG
<IngloriousPony89> flutter_spin: Woah Woah woah, The Illiad? You actually got to read that?
<flutter_spin> I don't like reading. Yes, it was assigned.
<Hazard> im going to write on my fic...its called Fallout Legacy btw...brb!
<IngloriousPony89> Lucky bastard. I'm actually planning to read that book one day.
<flutter_spin> No I didn't read it.
<StinkomanFan> I wanted to read Tom Sawyer but NOOOOOOO I got the not as good sequel
<Hazard> XD
<flutter_spin> Never read Tom Sawyer. It wasn't assigned.
<BronyinJapan> Hey Hazard just wanted to thank you for linking me that finfic it was really good
<Bluestrom_S> http://joshcraven.deviantart.com/art/You-are-my-most-favourite-princess-ever-287902090
<Bluestrom_S> that's wallpaper wrothy right there
<flutter_spin> I just recall that every year there were 4 main books we had to read. I think the only one that I tried to read was Wuthering Heights
<StinkomanFan> Plus it completely spoiled the ending of the one book I WANTED to read
<IngloriousPony89> Hmm Wuthering Heights... that rings a bell...
<Swordsman> I like reading in Latin
<Polydunami> We got assigned Of Mice and Men at one point
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqKdH569OwQ
<CupcakeWarrior> Polydunami: I hated that book
<flutter_spin> I stopped reading Picture of Dorian Gray after the first chapter
<StinkomanFan> Seriously screw Huck Finn, terrible book
<Polydunami> It was an okay book for me
<Polydunami> Kind of boring and ended on a bad note
<Polydunami> Not my cup of tea at all
<flutter_spin> Lord of the Flies was never assigned
<TopHat> I like Tom Sawyer
<TopHat> It's a good song
<Swordsman> Not reading the Cambridge Latin course? You all make me sad
<RainbowJack> RoboGerbil http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ljjOTbLjg
<StinkomanFan> I was able to skip reading Lord of the Flies by moving to another school :p
<IngloriousPony89> Cambrige Latin course? What's that? :P
<flutter_spin> I think Utopia was assigned once? The class objected.
<RoboGerbil> RainbowJAck: YAY!
<Swordsman> It's a series of Latin story books disguised as textbooks that teach you Latin as you read
<RoboGerbil> GOAL
<RainbowJack> hehe
<flutter_spin> The only book I read that wasn't assigned was, wait for it.....
<flutter_spin> Land of the Unicorns
<RainbowJack> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1TcUzhb9o&feature=related lol
<IngloriousPony89> My school only offers Spanish as a foreign language class :(
<RoboGerbil> yeh they got those for all the mane 6 and some others
<RainbowJack> Forget you,i can eat all these apples http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7YA5F5EWwI&feature=related
<Swordsman> I'm homeschooled. i'm taking Spanish in co-op and Latin in my online school
<Polydunami> I do not care for today's Family Guy
<IngloriousPony89> I do not care for Family Guy at all
<flutter_spin> nice rainbow. I remember that
<Polydunami> Family Guy was at its best when it first started out
<StinkomanFan> I don't have cable so I don't get to see the bad TV nowadays
<Swordsman> *Takes Spanish while already taking Latin*...*Three Spanish Lessons Later* "AH DIOS PORQUE"
<IngloriousPony89> I never got into the show, but recently the few episodes that I see aren't all that good
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=un1_EEuASqs
<StinkomanFan> I also don't get to see HUB, so it's a double edged sword
<flutter_spin> It is probably why I like MLP. Land of the Unicorns was a good book.
<IngloriousPony89> Sometimes biases can be good :P
<flutter_spin> Though I've heard the book is likened to Narnia
<RoboGerbil> zomg epic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRTt4rymw2A&feature=related
<StinkomanFan> Zecora taught me stereotypes are wrong and that eating the purple flowers with the green thorns leads to bad things....
