03the controller looks cool but then again it's basically just a tablet :P:
12True

03granted my TV doesn't have buttons on it but yeah
03I mean controller buttons
12They should have made it compatible with DS games

06I have no words.

6I wore this shirt all day friday at fanime
03like that girl playing with the dolls
03I'm like
03when I was little
/me is bored, and looking for someone who plays Magicv: the Gathering
6and i didn't get a single photo of me in it
03I played with lite-brites and stuff
03you know, interactive things
03not action figures
03but I usually just cuddled with them when I was going to bed
03heck, i still do
6same lol

03hm
03I'm not crying this time

6cuz kangaroos are awesome
Watched Tommy Wiseau's 'The Room' last Friday.

Sad

So many pony pictures to save.
So little time.
XD

HAHAHA, good point. XD
Whaaaaaaaat
No wonder I couldn't reload the fanfic pages
D:

Server failure
12"The connection has timed out
The server at www.lugia.us is taking too long to respond."
I have no Big Macintosh folder. O_o
oh and I'm excited about only needing one piece for my lab map too for my nerd side
Oh, which one do you need?
I have a few
I might have it
5
one min
http://www.sunnyneo.com/lab_map_prices.php
I got SUCH a good deal on the one island piece so many people were selling it for 500k I got it for just 300
I actually somehow have two of those
want one?
REALLY???
omg
your the best
do you want anything back?
yeah, I think I must have won them from keyquest or something
Nah, you can just have it
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HUGZ
:D
LOL this GIF: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130746287260.gif (not a pony GIF)

:D
<3
Hahaha, love this GIF.
"the lab ray is fired at Anfernee...and he doesn't change at all"
BAWWWWW
Lol.
How does that thing work?
Is there a time limit until you can use it again?
yes you can use it once a day
and you can choose the neopet you want it to fire on
it could do anything like change color species stats etc
I might even be able to get a draik or a krawk with it if I get lucky enough one day
I only have three
oh :(
I could probably buy them all but I'm saving my points for something, not sure what yet
mhm
have you seen the new wheel yet??
Oh that really expensive one?
What's it called again?
yeah @__@;
wheel of extravagance
I was going to try it, but the wheels usually rip me off
yeahh
Especially the wheel of Knowledge
I hate that one
right now I'm throwing all my money away at bilge dice
I actually do alright on that one sometimes
*pay 500 points* "Good job taking such good care of your Neopet!"
if I get a book I'll just sell it and sometimes I'll get a little more than what I spent on the wheel
the one that rips me off is the faerie one
	A green scorchio flies past and says 'Hope you are having fun!'
I got one yesterday where a bug said it would eat all my pets' food when I'm not looking
XD
OK bug, you do that :P
I also get the one with the crazy ass chias going OMFG ____ IS PLAYING 2NITE @ DA CLUBBBB
Haha
I got the avatar then never went to another concert again
bilge dice won't give me my av :C
Altair; hai
03wow @ this Unsolved Mysteries case
03I walked into the middle of it, but wow
03it's this mother who went insane, killed her own kids, and then died - either by suicide or homicide
I'm at the point in the game though where if I win I get 2000 np though
so w/e
I've never played that game
is it another one of those chance ones?
it's strangely addicting
yeah it is
I always lose money from those
yeahh
there's 2 avs for it too
7>>
7<<
one of them you get randomly when you score 24 points
and the other one is if you win 10 games in a row
03oh wait
03that's what the jury was saying, the only evidence is that the kids died, and the mother said it was a break-in
How do you play this? o.o
I don't get it
you NEED to pick a 1 and 4 when you see it, and then choose the highest number that you have and roll
Oh
haha I'm terrible at this
;o
OMG
I GOT THE AC
AHUHGIURHGIHRGIRDHGRDIH
*AV
AHGKRHGIHDRGIHDRIG
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY
XD
yay
NOW I DON'T EVER HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN
EXCEPT I WANT TO
SO
WHATEVER
need to get all my money back
XD
I've been playing that habitarium game
it's so pointless
bahh I don't get that game :C
you barely have to do anything
it's the equivalent of watching a pet goldfish swim around and feed it 3 times a day but still sitting there watching it for 24 hours
pretty much
yeah, the only reason I even tried it was for the game challenge a few months ago
I just leave it on whenever I have my computer on
I wish I had more trophies :(
which explains why the neofriends list thing says I've been online for like 5 hours
XDD
So I herd u liek neopets?
yup
is it just me or is neopets not loading userlookups?
It seems extra slow today
habitarium is taking forever too
Was playing with that akinator thing earlier today with my sister.
We managed to get penis, lawl (we be so mature).
I thought it had to be a character :P
It can be pretty much anything that's alive.
We got virus too.
omg

luv bellsprout
Oh Spyroforum
phpBB : Critical Error
Could not connect to the database
Hahaha.
ohai
that used to happen ALL THE TIME
SR probably decided "Why am I losing money on this?".
And downgraded the hosting.
I just talked to him today about some guy that needed to be banned
Maybe he did something weird
And accidentally caused that error
He just banned "*".
XD
lol
haha
figures
he cares very deeply about his investments
He did ban a whole ISP just to get the one guy
LOL fail.
nice
well
now he has something else to deal with
I was going for scyther, and it came up with rayquaza.
I said if anyone complains it's not my fault
He said if anyone complains I should tell them to email no-reply@spyroforum.com
7Blame a lack of TST for my presence. :P
...
Wow.
That's a bit harsh.
10So TST's servers are down? Or is it just my computer?
When he wants to do something there's really no persuading him any other way
Unless you want a huge argument
7It's TST in its entirety.
7Unless we're both facing the same problem.
And he blamed all the arguments on me. right
lol I can't connect either
I'm talking to him n ow
www.spyroforum.com
Oh, that explains it
He's moving the database server
Somewhere cheaper? :P
I think bradsbox.com is his own host
it's been there
thought it was already there
he thinks the Mysql is just malfunctioning
ohh
yeah, i misread that
Anyone could click the link and tell him it's down
.v.
:#

6It's annoying since I'm just starting it today so I have to do all the tedious, not fun stuff now.
6But I'll get to do the fun stuff later.
8lol, to me it would all seem tedious
8but i suppose what im doing would probably seem tedious to you
8and most other people
6...I have like seven chat windows open, so sorry if I'm unresponsive.
7On another note, it's going to be >95 degrees Fahrenheit tomorrow and the day after. O.i
7O.o*
8no probz
8im barely focusing on this chat as it is
6...one of my friends just complained to me that they don't like the standard layout of the website.
6I am NOT coding a forum skin. NOT going to happen.
6gtg talk later dude
6Probably bbs

o_O
lolwut?
Quite surprising to see you here o_O
7Hey, NS.
7Blame TST for being down. :P
Yeah I saw you say that ;p
weird
a lot of people can't connect
!check lugia.us
Oh
It's not just you! http://lugia.us looks down from here.
DNS is down
7Yep.
72.20.16.202
or that for ocean
7Either or both?
either
first one is island second is ocean
derp
7Meep.
7Danke.
tell anyone who can't connect to try connecting to 67.21.84.209 or 72.20.16.202
no problems
anyway
/me slaps Altair around with a fish
oi, idiot, get your ass online!
10Neither of those work, NS
7Worked for me. O_o
Really, Skylands? o.O
!dns 72.20.16.202
Resolved 72.20.16.202 to: ocean.lugia.us
lol reverse DNS
but it does/should work
if all else fails you could try a BNC or mibbit
10Tried Mibbit
http://www.mibbit.com/chat?server=67.21.84.209:6667
er

http://02.chat.mibbit.com/?server=67.21.84.209:6667&nick=Skylands
7There you go.
I'm hoping that works but I don't have mibbit access atm, school is a bitch
hurp
10Still strange how mIRC won't connect
So put tor on a USB.
Skylands lol
try go to cmd and type ipconfig /flushdns
and then try connect with mIRC
what message are you getting with mIRC?
lmao
tor doesn't work
I'm here now
Then you're doing it wrong. :P
I'm on a local admin account so I don't need it on a USB
oh trust me, my school blocks a lot of shit
10[19:11] * Connecting to ocean.lugia.us (6667) - [19:11] * Unable to resolve server
and even if I did have tor I'd have to route everything through my school's proxy first
10When I try both Island and Ocean
then find a tor IP that's not blocked and then try use it
lol you're doing it wrong
Pfft, they can't block everything.
-> /server 67.21.84.209
TST's domain is down atm
!dns island.lugia.us
Heya Sky :3
Unable to resolve island.lugia.us
notice that, because the nameservers aren't replying to your request and telling you the IP to connect to
10Hm
Just set up a DNS server, then it doesn't matter. :P
lol
And I got her on using Chrome
of course not, but so far nothing I've tried has worked
Her FF broe
03*WB02(Skylands02)03WB* - <Skylands> 10If N's name turns out to be Nintendo, I will shoot myself
Ohaiu :3
they use NTLM authentication and shits
hurp
03dhki
10Thanks NS
I told her to do that too
But it didn't work o.o
wut

..Quan's here?
The butter
yeah
that's unusual
because TST was having DNS issues and she couldn't connect ;x
7To satiate a mental fixation for IRCs, I suppose. :P
ah. well hi
We watched that and "A Fistful Of Dollars".
7I've been here before, if you don't know.
yeah, I know
just you usually aren't
7Yeah. I have excuses for that.
/me bashes Altair with a whip

x_x My laptop recently got infected with the boot sector virus but i managed to fix it
A fistful of bananas

Yeah?
how do you set up reverse DNS for IPv6? ;x

well
I think I have the configs and everything done okay
but does IPv4 work together with it?
I think so.
okay
but blah, so confused
and I'm worried I'm going to fuck something up ;x
So back up your config files. :P

02caps. lol
02lmfao*
o-o
okay thanks
well
it's not fucking up bind9 that I'm worried about
because configuring it isn't that hard
it's just after I get the VPS provider to switch the nameservers, if mine isn't configured properly then it's screwed
If I remember right I had to pastebin ~10 different files for you. :P
yeah pretty much
I figured out how to configure all the other stuff now though
I had to configure bind9 for Altair's server as his router was being a cock
wasn't resolving the reverse stuff of IPs and everything
causing problems for ZNC and IRC
uh, unrealircd
I could test out IPv6 to see if I can get it working right.
that'd be nice
I'm more concerned about whether I'd fuck everything up
because apparently you have to register your nameservers with ARIN or something
8nice
and if I don't configure my shit correctly it won't work very well
because since i have so many IPv6 IPs, I'm not going to ask the VPS provider to change every single reverse DNS lol
8it was only like 90 when i left work
Hahahaha.
6It's about 90 here.
8i would be jelly if i didnt have a/c

6That's not bad at all.
It's free.
I downloaded it once
It kept bugging me to pay $30 or something
It has a guilt 'please buy license' message when you open it.
it was annoying
Since I hardly ever have to open it, no problems there.
8yeah
8its a place to sleep and surf ponychan, thats really all i need right now
6I've got a place to sleep. And a place down the street for ponychan. So I'm good. Even if my place to sleep is a couch.
8my bed isnt much better than a couch
6I actually have trouble sleeping in real beds I'm so used to couches... >.<;
6For like, 8 years I've been sleeping on couches.
8fair enough lol
8i cant sleep anywhere except a bed
8camping is a nightmare
6I can sleep standing up.
6Did so in my junior year in highschool.
04mew
6During trig.
6Was awesome.
8wut
8how
8i dont even...
6For like, five minutes.
6I used to sleep in class everyday because I knew the lessons, essentially.
6One day, teacher told me to stand in the back of the room, wasn't allowed to lean against the wall.
6After about ten minutes I was so bored I fell asleep standing up.
6Five minutes later she yelled at me and woke me up.
8lol
8that'll teach em
6After that she just left me alone.
6That was about a month into the school year.
8i had a high school teacher who would mess with people if they fell asleep in class
8one time he had everyone in the class go and stand out in the hall, then turned the lights off and closed the shades
8another time he poured water in someone's shoe
6That's pretty awesome.
8funny story, he's now an assistant principal in charge of discipline at my former high school
8i like to think he does the same stuff though
6That's beyond awesome.
8im trying to find a version of part of my trip that is case sensitive

8I'm trying to get MPPony
6Oh.
03hi
6I can probably get that for you.
8because MPP stands for merriweather post pavilion, which is my favorite album of all time, and pony because ponies
8what do you mean you can get it for me?
6Does it have to be aligned to the left?
8nah, just anywhere
6My tripcode explorer runs INCREDIBLY fast.
8ah
6What's yours up to?
8 119 million
6I just started mine... 80 million.
8oh wow
6Yeah.
6My average is 1.14M per second.
8im pretty sure my computer is about to burn a whole in my desk too
8hole*
6XD
8i feel like an idiot
6I just wiped my comp like, a month ago, so it's like having a fresh comp, to be fair.
6Nothing to slow it down.
6Just hit 200M
8ah
8ive had this laptop for almost 3 years now
8ive pretty much just constantly added shit and never deleted anything
6I've had this about the same time.
6Yeah... mine was like that a month ago.
6I also run a bunch of searches at once.
6So, yeah.
6I have SO many Rarity trips.

6No Dash... I should add that to the list...
6lol I got an all lowercase mppony.
8already?
8damn
o-o
6I'm not running it case sensitive because I'd lose out on other trips I'm searching for.
6I've got 5 mppony ones, but only one that's not mishmashed with the capitalization, and that's the all lowercase one.
6lol MPPoNY
8so close

6That.
6I have no words for how awesome that is.
6>.<; mPPonY
You still fixing Spyroforum?
Yeah
MySQL died
/me kicks it
I think the server itself, the actual hardware, is corrupted
8dah, so close again
dang
that sucks
6I've already hit 900M XD
6And this is me running slow since I have so much stuff open.
8jesus
so why... are you fixing spyroforum?
I'm fixing the server
well yeah, but I thought it was SR's server
It's a server problem, not a spyroforum problem
I'm confused
I'm fixing it for him
Guest67655: When is your latest full MySQL backup?
siphon some money
@pony
WOOT!
@pokemon
hey dari
you should add the Unova pokemon
Unova sucks
D:<
Does not
You suck
I've grown to like the Unova region
lol
and its pokemon
pfft
plus the event for it's release is the most fun I've ever had at the MOA
*its
just like ponies
8so many depression threads on /oat/ lately
RDX just doesn't appreciate these things
6I KNOOOOOOOOOW. It's so... I don't even know.
he should learn to appreciate them more
starving children don't have either of them
8and the problem is, i feel morally obligated to post in all of them, even though im terrible at cheering people up
6Same...
Spyroforum is probably going to be down for the rest of the night until I can figure out how to fix this
Just fyi
Yeah, I figured
No big deal

6I posted his very first one.
6He had another, but I didn't cap it... it wasn't directed at any specific person though it was a thread directed at all of /oat/
7Hey, Chim.
/me needs to take a break from fixing the server in order to work on his school stuff

8god, i love a good spiderman/gary thread
8i hope the mods dont delete it
Soo
'sup guise
6I like the threads, and don't see why they have any reason to delete it. It's not like they're derailing other threads.
8well, its pretty obvious that keldeo created it
Yo
hi again

A broken iPad is more useful than a working one
6Ah. In that case, probably going to get moved.

Why?
Cutting cardboard? XD
7Cutting cardboard intricately for details.

You shouldn't tell her until you're done :D
7Oh, no, she knows.
oh
7Does anyone know where I can find some tarnished-brass colored foil?
trying to decide which pony episode to download for my iPod
6Run an RP where someponies in it don't like other ponies in it. General pain in the flank.
Best Night Ever
that was my favorite
Yeah
mine too
hmmm yeah maybe
that and the western one
I'm able to get 2 right now
and Winter Wrap Up
those were all tied for my favorite
I actually didn't like the western one that much :C
yeah, Winter Wrap up Was good
Really? I liked it quite a bit
I'm not really a ~western~ person in general no matter what the show/entertainment
ah
I love westerns
that may be why I liked it so much
:P
:P
plus I didn't like pinkie's song in it
and she looked like a whore
neither did the characters
:P
as far as songs go
8that sounds terrible
Best Night Ever wins
by far
8for you i mean
AT DA GALA
WITH DA PRINCE$$
...that's all I remember
hahah
Dari could probably recite the whole thing
wouldn't be surprised
XD
he probably made a script for it
and sing it with perfect key
just like SR did with lesley gore's sunshine lollipops and rainbows
haha, that was so weird
BRIIIIIGHTER THAN A LUCKY
I have a hard time imagining SR singing
PENNY
Especially those words
XD
http://avalonskynoise.tumblr.com/post/6305794354
SUNSHINE LOLLIPOPS AND, RAINBOWS
EVERYTHING THAT'S WONDERFUL IS WHAT I FEEL WHEN
WEEEEEEE'RE TOGETTTHER
<3
I didn't even mean to make the heart
whoooops
:P
hahaha
XD at that link
Where did that come from anyway?
That script
I'm trying to remember but it seemed like it just came from nowhere
No one said anything about that song ever
he made it for some reason idk
all I know is that I still love that song now
IT'S MUH PARTY AND I'LL BAWWWW IF I WANT TO
BAWWWW IF I WANT TO
BAWWWW IF I WANT TO
XD
I remember that song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsYJyVEUaC4
YOU WOULD BAWWWW TOO IF IT HAPPENED TOOOOO YOUUUUUUU~
bbl
6It's... annoying. But it'll be worked out.
/me 7is happy she got one of the three insignias on the book done.
I can't believe we're finally here.
we're where?
With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is starting to make this the BEST NIGHT EVER!
oh

Just got back from X-Men First Class.
The song is so long.
Not typing out all the words.
how does it feel being 64?
:P
oooh nice
lol
Just Rainbow Dash lyrics.
"When I'm 64..."
I feel... expired.
Been dreaming, I've been waiting, yo fly with those great ponies.

12 Hello, Quack|2 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
How was the movie?
I see. My condolences for your lost youth.
I've heard it's really good
It was much better than I was expecting.
Sort of rejected the comic storyline in some respects, but held very true for the most part.
My biggest pet peeve was some of the recasts looking nothing like their previous incarnations.
haha
like Beast
oi
looks nothing like Kelsey Grammar
haha
Did SF get fixed by the way?
nope
not yet
I've been waiting to post to it
which makes me wonder why SR isn't working on it himself
The dude who voices Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell was in it for a bit.
Michael Ironside?
Nice
Yeah.
Didn't know if you'd know him by name.
Ew, Xmen
boring
I played splinter cell a bit back in my time
:<
I think I've seen the first two of the Xmen films.
The acting was pretty superb. I'm finding it difficult not to spoil anything right now.
/me points a finger at Aero
YOU again
I hate all of you
ME
haha
so muc
YOU
We hate you too
thanks
:D
Do you hate Xmen too?
MEEE
Why do you hate use now?
us*
DINNER?
We're not even talking about ponies.
FO SHO
:P
I haven't seen the new one yet
COOLIO
heard it was decent
I haven't seen any of them
dari: for RDX hate means he thinks we're cool
You hate me because you don't understand me. Humans have always feared what they could not understand. I am a mutants, yes... but I am the future.
yes yes
*mutant
Oh, so he thought we were cool for talking about ponies.
I just have a hard time taking anything with the name "X-men" seriously to be honest"
my mentality is very backwards sometimes
I dunno
LOL
The Wii 2 is looking pretty badass
*males to females
X-Humans
XD
RDX: Indeed
Wii-U looks AWFUL.
I want one
really?
how so?
Sorry, had to burst that out.
o.o
I think it looks epic
I tihnk it looks cool
Looks, yes.
cool, epic
granted by then Sony and Microsoft will come out with better consoles
Functions the same if not worse than current consoles.
still looks oold though
Didn't sony say they weren't working on a new console any time soon?
Well Nintendo is always a generation behind on the console game
But at least Nintendo is finally using HDMI.
idc
what, really?
All I want to know is if KH3 will come out on that or PS3
I thought it was you who showed me they weren't
I heard they said there's still a lot of life left in the PS3
No, that's what I said
oh
I read it too fast
They're /not/ making a new one
Hey
then yes I did hear that
Not sure about Xbox
and don't really care either
Xbox isn't. Kinect was all they needed.
yeah
major issues?
They plan to just keep updating the same console.
Yeah
zip a dee do da
Which saves us from being milked by Microsoft, I guess.
Kinect meh. PS Move meh. New wii meh.
crap.
Nintendo's the only one upgrading
It's better that way for those two
At least in that tiny area.
aggreed
The Wii could use an update though
Definitely
they have the online ability that can be used to update
LOL
Yeah, Nintendo needs to catch up and try to appeal to more than just the non-gaming crowd.
before I saw the trailers I thought the new controller thing looked stupid
epic SR quote for sure
same here
what did he say?
/me points to epic chat
They focused so much on demographics that never really bought video games that they forgot about their original following: people who already WERE.
not in epic-chat
Haha
funny his fucking database is the one fucked up and he can't even bother to fix it himself anyways
Nintendo consoles may not be advanced
but they make great games for them
Why can't he fix it himself?
:O Great games? I can count on one hand the titles I actually like for Wii...
Just doesn't want to?
Pretty much everyone bought a wii (good for Nintendo), but I find that most people stopped using theirs after less than a year.
I don't get it
that supports the forum
hm
They seemed like a good idea, but when it comes down to it for 'proper' games, I just prefer a normal controller.
And he's fixing it for him
Thank you, Dari. xD
Lol
Like he'd ever be humble enough to admit something like that
most likely not
I'm just saying that there are still a lot of good games on the Wii despite that
most of them Mario games, sure
I just... can't agree to that.
but still
sure not many, if any, good hardcore games
Yeah
but sometimes I want something that's just fun
The Wii is just fun
without being taken seriously
It's like Spyro
right
Are games ever to be taken seriously?
I think some are
Games with serious stories, yeah
I don't play too many of those
I mercilesslymake fun of eve the games I love, with brilliant plots.
*even
well, me too
Oh yeah, so do I
but I do the same with books and movies
I still take them seriously though
but you can still take them somewhat seriously at the same time
yeah
I pretty much only take the multiplayer aspect seriously, and that's only if I want to excel in the game.
You don't have to choose between making a joke of everything and making something serious fcking business
that's the part I tend to not take seriously
:P
SR might have to get a new server
multiplayer I treat as one of those "just for fun" aspects of gaming
About time
well
maybe it will make him actually change something for once
04meow
I don't get why he didn't get a new one before this
doubt it
my K/D ratios tend to suck
We'll get a new server, maybe
because he's too stubborn to do it
SR has finally outgrown his little chrysalis.
but they don't mean anything to me really
the end users will see no difference
Yeah, I was being sarcastic.
or doesn't see any "gain" in doing it
haha
IT'S NOT A TUMOR
But he's still in denial that the walls are tearing.
btw the electronic sheep screensaver is awesome
electronic sheep?
Do andriods dream of them?
*androids
computer dreams supposedly
oh no
kill them with fire
jk
http://electricsheep.org/
electric sheep
whatever
That's the book Blade Runner is based on...
Kind of looks like weird fractals.
that sounds really cool actually
I got it on two of my computers now
pretty cool stuff
two of your computers?
How many do you have?
XD
four
with one that doesn't work
O_o
so five
I have two
I have one...
I is jealous
netbook and big fat 17 inch laptop
two desktops and three notebooks
jeeze
And I thought my two were excessive
XD
There are 4 in the house, only 1 that I own though.
lol
I counted up all the computers in our house once
dari: same here
I think there were 8
not counting my dad's smartphone
O_o
well if I count for us
we have...
actually wait
11
only 3 in this house
one being mine
What the hell.
Yeah
O_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
Where are the others?
I only know of yours, Evan's, the one by the TV, and the work one
that makes 5
LIVE ON ELECTRIC SHEEP
MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY
GRAVE DIGGER
One family desktop, my mom and dad's desktop, my two laptops, Evan's laptop, my mom's laptop, my dad's laptop, and my mom's two ancient laptops that never get used
So 9
he grabed wepon
I have five, my sisters each have one, my dad has one, and my mom has three
I have one
my mom and sister share one
and one desktop
Oh wait, there's actually 5 in the house.
if my dad counts we have four
but he's only home on weekends
Jenna is the only one who doesn't have a laptop
So the desktop is basically hers now
No one else uses it
I can't remember why, but there's something I dislike about laptops.
Oh yeah, the screens aren't big enough.
17 inchers are not bad
yeah, that's like mine
my Asus is 17.3
If I would have known that I didn't NEED a laptop for college like they say I'd have gotten a desktop instead
largest one I could find
It's weird going from using the netbook for a while back to using this one
"this screen is tiny" "this screen is huge"
Compared to 30" they are.
Why would you need a 30" monitor?
that's bigger than most TVs
PONIES
Oh, it's only 27".
Haha
Well still
So I can fit lots of stuff on it.
17.3 is big enough for me
two windows at once is all I need
You should see my desktop when I have lots of stuff open.
any more than that and I start to get overwhelmed anyway
I can barely have two conversations at once on MSN
As it is I have about 40 tabs and 10 things open.
O.O
And that's after all my stuff got shut down when the computer blue screened.
LOL
One person will end up getting ignored while I talk to the other
Hahaha.
True.
Yay
time for a new NC
NC?
Nostalgia Critic
a new North Carolina?
Oh.
oh
I still see the old one from last week
wb LL
click on the NC to open that section up
it will be in there
it's not up on the main page yet
02rawr~
Haven't seen any of that guy's videos.
Little Nemo
tys
What is that?
laaaa
dari: I've only seen a couple
I don't really care for him
too overdramatic
idk
never heard of it
but I'm gonna find out
he's an internet personality lol
oh, I beleive it
some like him
Some people on that site are just unbearable with how overdramatic they are
some don't
still too much for me though, honestly
I find him hilarious
Most of the time I like him
Sometimes it's a little too much though
03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
03o.o
Ngz b trippin
this is a pretty funny video
I paused it to watch a game trailer
:P
Unfortunately I can't understand a word of it because it's all Japanese
So... many... trailers... due to E3...
I'm seriously considering getting a PS3 now
thanks to E3
I should have waited to get one
this is the first time I've ever seen it
they have wireless internet in them now
my older model doesn't
I want to get one too
PS3 got some good exclusives? I'm surprised.
They didn't always?
It was always about the exclusives!
inFamous, Resistance, etc.
Other than GT5 what?
because I will get a new one and trade you if it is
no it isn't
oh
damn
I have my old PS2
I still use that
My PS3 is backwards compatible. >:P
the new models might be
We'll trade you!
How else can I play my darling Spyro?
mine isn't though
RDX: only the old models are
the very old ones
The new models are no longer BC. Only the 60 gig PS3 was, years ago.
which is why they're so rare
oh well
I still have my PS2
that's good enough for me
I think 20, 40, and 60 GB ones were
well then mine might be
After that they stopped making them backwards compatible with PS2
but I only use it for PS3 games and Blueray
Oh, the first ones, yeah.
But they're still backwards compatible with PS1
=/
Even then, they weren't BC with /every/ title.
so it was like the 360
really?
I never heard that
me neither
thought that was only the 360 that did that
I can play any playstation game so I'm good
Same.
Got my PS2.
About 95%, but a few of my games happened to not work.
I still have a PSX and PS2
But I'd rather just have one console
Evidently I had some obscure titles.
oops
I don't think it mattered which title it was
It had the actual PS2 hardware
So I don't think it could have been selective about which games it could play
Not all of them did. They used an adapter after the first year.
Oh, yeah, I'm talking about the first ones
I guess PS2 hardware wasn't worth the cost to them.
I still never heard of that adapter though
Also, the PS2 didn't play every PS game.
seriously?
this is all new to me
Me too
I'm almost sure of that.
Got any sources?
Let me confirm that.
I always thought the 360 was the only console that was ever selectively backwards compatible
Not really interested in the Vita
me neither
PSP never interested me either
What's the vita?
LOL
the new Playstation handheld
"Undaunted by its recent rough ride at the hands of hackers"
Oh please
They were the ones who had the rough ride?
don't try to tell us it "wasn't anonymous" again
"SUESUESUESUESUESUESUESUE"
it looks exactly like the PSP, but with a touchscreen and some social networking feature
and from what I heard they had a perfectly legitimate reason to sue
the Vita I mean
Yeah, social networking thing is meh
If it
*it's optional, I'll ignore it
but it'll still be annoying that it's there
If it's not optional... even less interested
I hate to cite wikipedia, but I'm lazy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_incompatible_with_PlayStation_2
They had no reason to sue. They sued some harmless homebrew developers. They sued all of Team Fail0verflow for hacking the console when they didn't even release their hacks.
I thought someone got a hold of something they weren't supposed to have had
They own the console.
A developer secret or something
They can do whatever the hell they want with it.
That's what I heard
No, it was all an issue of what was considered "tampering" with the console.
They owned the console, as Dari says, so they should have free reign.
They never agreed no to.
not*
I heard that the hackers had gotten all sorts of personal information from other Sony users
...
as well as money
In fact, there was a clause originally that actually said they could do whatever they wanted.
Yeah, and that too
No money.
which is why Sony had to shut it down
But Sony withdrew it at some point afterward.
To protect their customers' identities
Someone hacked PSN, and stole all the details (probably not credit card details).
No one know who did it.
It wasn't any of the people who made homebrew I'd say almost for sure.
LulzSec claims responsibility.
Oh yeah, they released all the information didn't they?
it's like a witch hunt if you ask me
I think I saw it on their site.
but either way I don't see what sony did wrong honestly
Ostensibly, yeah.
I'm sure I read an article that explained that what the hackers did was illegal
It wasn't.
I don't see why it's them who're the bad guys, and not the hackers
Sony did something illegal.
Unfortunately I found that link from Spyroforum
They removed otherOS.
Sony's mistake was having such a weak security of its 70 million+ users who put their personal info in Sony's hands.
So I can't get to it now
An advertised feature.
They got sued in several places for that.
Then they sued hackers for doing stuff with consoles THEY owned?
That's not right.
Whoever was the culprit of the "hacking" should be thanked, given nothing has been stolen.
Microsoft does it all the time
they brick modded consoles
nobody complains about them
This wasn't a modded console.
...that's what you just said
They weren't using hacks online.
They hadn't entered into any agreements.
If you agree with Microsoft's terms to use Xbox live you probably agree to having your console bricked if you mod it.
When geohot released CFW he even disabled something to stop piracy.
(some people worked out how to do it anyway, but that was pretty late, so other CFWs that allowed piracy came into existence soon after)
Sony didn't sue any of the people who made backup managers that allowed piracy.
So they sued the wrong people
Sony made youtube and several other people give up all the IP addresses of people who had even viewed certain pages/videos.
....
Well, it was more like they sued the people who stole candy bars instead of those who stole museum art.
I never heard that
pretty sure they can't do that
No one can do that
They did.
Why would youtube agree to do that
that makes no sense
A judge said they had to.
One person.
Uh, no, I was just saying that hoping for clarification
making sure I got it right
Dari, do you have any news articles or anything confirming all of this?
Oh, google had to hand over IP address too.
Sure.
I'm finding pleanty about Sony mishandling the situation out of incompetance
but nothing about them abusing anyone's rights
Google = YouTube, so no need to specify that.
This is the one about Sony getting the IP addresses of anyone who even visited geohot's site.
Let me find the one about google/youtube.
I think one of Sony's PR people who'd been with them 10+ years quit over what Sony'd done because they pretty much ruined his job.
I read the Wired article that the article of yours links to
and it sounds like yes, Sony took it a bit too far
but
they sued and did everything to not allow piracy
"Jailbreaking a console is also a prerequisite to running pirated copies of games, which Sony emphasizes in its lawsuit."
They sued people who had nothing to do with piracy.
But piracy is an assumption.
they sued one guy who made the hack
and showed others how to do the same
Team Fail0verflow didn't even release any of their work and they got sued, I'm fairly sure.
the guy released a jailbreak
There's no evidence of that among those who were sued.
jailbreak is needed for piracy
He released a jailbreak for iPods.
That's legal.
they want to get rid of the jailbreak so there won't be piracy
"and now the PlayStation 3 jailbreak"
Makes sense to me
Buying a gun is a "prerequisite" for robbing a bank, but does that mean everyone who buys that gun or knows how to get one will rob a bank?
No, but what else do you use a jailbreak for?
I'm not familiar with a jailbreak
I honestly don't know
what else does it do?
What else?
That's the whole point of it.
Personal experimentation. There are far more legal applications of a jailbroken console.
Having the ability to do WHATEVER you want on your own console.
Minus pirating
Well, as long as it's legal.
Which people were apparently doing because of this
So of course they're going to want to take it down
But anyone can take any instructional video and do something illegal with it.
I'm not saying they handled it the right way
That's hardly the fault of the defendants.
It is his fault for putting it out there, is probably how they saw it
if it wasn't there, people couldn't do that
No, it's not. It's beyond his control what people decide to do with the information.
you're pluralizing defendents
He never suggested piracy.
who else got sued by Sony?
What about Team Fail0verflow? They never released anything.
Not how it is
Still got sued.
But it's a shortsighted view, and everyone should be clear on that.
The first group of people who hacked the PS3.
and what did they do when they hacked it?
Nothing.
Fairly sure geohot released the information.
They still all got sued.
what do you mean?
how can you hack and do nothing?
there had to have been something
Modifying a console is not wrong. Modifying it for illicit purposes is.
OK, I think I've got it now
That's as condensed as I can make it.
They shouldn't have sued
But I still see where there were coming from
Since people were using that tool to do something illegal
honestly
I know a few people with homebrew for their DS
they all use it for pirated games
Wii got hacked, Nintendo didn't sue.
not my point
Yes, I get it
Sony shouldn't have sued
I said that already
Sheesh
Blarg?
I just don't see sony as the ultimate evil here
Well, piracy should be the ultimate evil.
But seeing as Sony is making such a huge mistake you can't just ignore that.
we're not ignoring it
To be honest I laughed hard when I found out that PSN had been hacked, even though that was my information stolen.
I was just uninformed of what happened before this discussion
well have fun
I thought I had the complete story from the article I read
g'night folks
Cya.
night RDX
Night
same here
I heard both sides of the story
neither really in depth
and I beleived the side in Sony's defense a bit more
it still makes sense to me
I just agree that sony took it too far
Homebrew is awesome anyway. HD shaders on the Atari, SNES, and even a NDS emulator soon to be released.
I still agree with their reasoning though
Amen. I have school in the morning.
Good night.
Night
happy birthday!
Haha, thanks. Sorry if I butted heads or missed the point. I've been doing homework intermittently while participating... never a good thing.
spyroforum is back up.
SPRINKLES
4Sup man
6'Sup
6You missed Hipster, and Bristles was here a LONG time ago, albeit briefly.
/me 6is here most of the time
4Huh
4So what did you guys talk about?
03*WB02(Kyu02)03WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD
nighty night
6Not much.
6I've been busy setting up a forum for an RP with my local friends.
6Which has been a pain since some of them may be quitting due to some people being in it.
6I dislike in-group hate.
4Setting up a forum? Is this separate from BMN and the other mods?
6This is completely seperate and has nothing to do with ponies.
6It's temporary because we needed somewhere for the RP that we've been planning for a while.
4The forum isn't going to be here is it? It won't be a chat based one, will it?
6No.
6It would be entirely too much of a pain in my neck to set up an RP based in IRC.
4*nods*
4So Sprinkles, have you found your Applebloom trip yet?
6Working on it.
6Also helping Hipster find a trip.
ello
*SUPPPZZ*
:D
4I am now trying to find a trip of my own
4 2732 million trips
4no "Giggle" yet
6case sensitive?
4Yes
6*puts on list* I'll tell you if I get it
4Awesome, thanks Sprinkles
6No problem.
Hello
omg
on the way home from the store
my mom asks me
you saw ponies?!
"hey are there any new ponies on demand"
:D
XD
XD
6Want it left aligned or does it not matter?
you have officiallyconverted her!
that reminds me
YUP
there's this sign that says BRONES
meaning Brone's Bike Shop
Brone being the guy who owns it
every time I drive past
I do a double take
you say BRONIES in your head
You should take a sharpie
YES
PUT AN I IN THERE
and write an 'i' on the sign
DO IT
:P
well, I'd need Paint, not a sharpie
it's a big sign
Still
do it
:P
GRAFFITI
one of those ones with removable letters
I should
VANDILISM FOR A GOOD CAUSE
disguise myself as a pony
and run out there at midnight and write in an 'I'
XDDD
4I'd prefer if it were left aligned. Like the first thing in the trip
4I just had one pop up but it's not first in the trip, unfortunately
/me hugs Kitten
6care if there's a single z in front of it?
6'cause I just got zGiggleWro
4Meh, no offense, I just want Giggle first
6No big deal.
6I'm already running Tripcode Explorer, so I might as well run things people are looking for anyway.
4I'm also running Tripcode Explorer. I'm just happy that I got a giggle so far. I may have to settle for Laugh if we can't get a proper giggle
6How many trips have you generated?
4 3621 Million so far
4One giggle
6I got two left aligned gIggLe ones. XD
6Generated 900M since I put Giggle on the list
4Man, your giggle searching capabilities is much better than mine o.O
6My tripcode explorer runs really fast for some odd reason...
6I passed Hipster's that had been running for apparently a little bit in only a few minutes.
4Nice, what was he looking for?
6MPPony case sensitive, just wherever
12..
what
ack
bbl
o.o
4Huh, I wonder what the significance of MP is
4I would have thought he wanted "Hipster"
4*shrugs*
6He said what it was...
6MPP stands for Merriweather Post Pavilion
4Yeah, but it doesn't make sense to me
6Me neither.
6But I'll run it for him anyway.
4Yeah
4Glad you could find it for him
6Haven't yet, unfortunately.
4Oh, I thought you had? Oh well
6I have been SO bored lately. >.<;
4Why?
6Just because... not sure really.
6Not really anything to entertain myself with, especially when doing the mundane parts of setting up the site I'm working on.
4Man, that bites
6Meh, if it means FINALLY getting it off the ground, I'm game for it.
4Yeah, I see what you mean
6lol
6I posted in the ban thread, the mods banned me but I didn't get the ban message screen.
oh hey
Spyroforum's back up

4I had that a few days ago. It was good
4By the way, how do I apply my new trip from Tripcode Explorer? Also, do you know where I could test it on the site?
4on Ponychan, I mean
12not if i was stunned from the fire and my beak was wide open when you poured water in
mhm
things like this make me not go to spyroforum often
the fact that it's a bit of a troll magnet at times you mean?
yes

3:30am
and that was last thursday
got up at 5:30am
04I've stayed up the whole night once.
04But that was with a friend.
lmao
04I looked outside and I was like "Wait...shit, it's morning."
I have too
but that was in year 8
when I didn't have shitloads of work to do
04Oh I stay up all the time with friends.
also btw
did you do the science comp today?
I think I fucked mine
04Yes ;-;
04I think I did pretty ok
I fell asleep halfway
still managed to finish on time
04LOLWUT
04No wonder you fucked it up
well
I don't think I fucked it that badly
but
I didn't know the answers to some questions
and such
and I stared at the first question
for like
2 minutes
and then was like "OH"
04XD
I know
I failed
also btw
what did you get
04It's a comp
04who cares
for the second last question?
04Uh
04which one was that?
the one about the SANP circuit shits
with A=1, B=1, B=0, etc. etc.
04Oh
yeah
04I did A=1, B=1
I think I got it wrong ;;
same
04I'm pretty sure that was right
but all my friends put A=0, B=1
or whatever, the other way round
so yeah
04Because then it's equal 0 which would equal 1 which would equal 0 or w/e
oh well
yeah
04It's was confusing.
;p
I was trying to keep my eyes open through the test
;x
04I was trying not to let my mind wander.
04ffs my story is finally progressing.
XD
what story?
life story?
04lolno
04Fanfic
oh
okay
I sometimes work on Reminiscence
I feel like doing TCTL though
been playing yugioh recently though, so I haven't been on my computer as much ;x
04Yugioh? The cards or the games?
games
04Ah
Yu-gi-oh 2011 World Championship
04I have Yugioh Worldwide Edition. Fun as hell.
I got Stardust Dragon, Red Dragon Archfiend, Shooting Star Dragon and Red Nova Dragon from Sazera
Sazerac*
As she finished the game
04oh
Red Nova Dragon is my favourite card <3
04cool
04You like dragons
I run a dragon deck
04/end
derp
my deck is actually pretty decent
sometimes
but Saz is like
the best deck maker ever
she has a deck where she can summon shooting star dragon on her first turn ;x
04o-o
04But
04Don't you need to shuffle your deck>
04So isn't it random>
yes
04?*
04fff
it's random
but she can still summon it on her first turnn
all she needs is foolish burial and that other card, forgot its name
that speed spell which allows you to special summon a level one monster
oh wait
no
not that one
it was some random combo
it needed foolish burial and dandelion to be in the deck
then you foolish burial'd dandelion which summoned 2 fluff tokens to the field
and then yeah
and shooting star dragon
is so fucking hard to kill it's not even funny
I can kill it with red nova or FGD but they're hard to get out
and my deck isn't a fusion dragon deck unlike my world championship 2006 one
12oh no a yugioh player D:
I seriously want to the malefic monster cards ;x
do you have them, Drake? .-.

hi uxie
Hey aggelos_the_dragon
hi
i didnt regognize you with that name
Heh
I'm DSD DSD=DArk Shadow Dragon
i read that the new game of spyro is going to be just like the old ones for ps1
yeah
It really does look that way.
i think that spyro is a bit ugly
i like the old spyro who was nice and sweet
Spyro doesn't talk in this new game, he looks fugly, and the storyline looks set to be nothing like the old games.
hi dari
:(
lol
Hey.
he doesnt talkkkkkkkk
i dont like it already
Well we don't really now
i feel like spyro doesnt excist anymore
It still has yet to come out
13Hi!
hi
Also The story being the same old one will get old real fast
4Besides theres a water dragon
13What you oui mean?
In this one he just seems like a dumb animal that runs around killing stuff and collecting stuff for no reason.
13No trashing SSA, Dari!
4http://en.spyro.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Zap
4A Water Dragon thats playable
4And maybe many more
13Cool!
It looks fugly too.
Why would I want to play as another character anyway?
4I would man
03gcg
4Now i can play with friends i beat the crap out of Spyro or play as a team
13So, duu!
call me crazy but i think spyro is alive and he is in heaven lol
uxie for the first time dari is right.they make spyro ugly and just like the 32 other characters.spyro sopposed to be special do you agree?
13Crid ib!
what crid ib means?
13It's in Al Bhed
13Learn by playing FFX or FFX-2, unless you think they are ugly!
anyway witch spyro do you like the new one or the old one?
I don't play/like FF games.
13Unsure
how can you be unsure?
13E tuhd ghof
4I like the Water dragon Zap
4They need online
...Online? In Spyro?
13Yep
>__>
13Not that oui care!
Well that isn't the worst idea I've heard today.
Oh wait, it is.
:P
you need internet to play the game?
:s
4No
4I'm saying they should add it so you can play wordwide
it going to be like world of warcraft?
13What would you rather see, Dari: Meteors killing us all, or the new Spyro game?
Meteors could be fun, you never know.
13Heartless
:) looooool
4-Not sure
4I think how it will be is
4You get your game amd stuff
4But if you want you can play online in pvp or story mode or random levels
PvP? In Spyro...Oh my God this game is even worse than I thought.
do you believe that spyro is alive and that it lives. i believe it.am i crazy?
13Spyro is not dead, as proven over and over again!
I wish they would just let it die. They've ground his name into the dirt. :P
With so many horrible reruns.
13Did not!
4PvP would be fun
4Pawning the S*** out of noobs
4getting pawned
4Playing with friends
4Co-op levels
i feel that spyro is my friend.because when i was a kid no one has given me attention.so i was playing spyro in ps1
4I can now play with friends
13Hey, DSD, what would you like to see in a fan-made cartoon of the series?
4Aw
4Well try this
4See?
4Watching sure
4Being a part of sure
4Being a cartoon is another story
13True
13But a cartoon of the classic series could calm the fans who hate the new game
13Though it shoud take place after Shadow Legacy
there are not a lot of fans of spyro because they didnt have the chance to met him by the original games
what do you think?
13True
13It would be good
why did insomniac sell spyro?
13They ran out of ideas
6i have plentyyyy of ideas
13Same here
13I can imagin Spyro going back in time, enter a computer sistom (parody of Tron) even helping some old allies when Ripto or Gnasty Gnorc started to become threats again
10!espeon !sneas !umbreon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 8 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 60 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 5 minutes
6nice
13I just wish I worked for Insomiac at the time...
13But still, Ratchet & Clank is just as awsome!
6ey i just wrote that
13Opps, cunno!
[15:38] <aggelos_the_dragon> why did insomniac sell spyro? They never owned the intellectual property to him.
They didn't have a choice to make more games (not that I think they would have).
13They created that series, Dari!
I know, but they didn't own the idea.
6i wanna work for insomniac but that will never happens because i live in greece
13Then WHO did!?
13I cannot ether. I live in Australia
Saw it somewhere on an insomniac forum, I'll try and find it for you.
6you have more chances to work to insomniac
UxieLover1994: see this http://www.insomniacgames.com/community/index.php?topic=40603.0;wap2
13Cool!
"Right now Sierra owns Spyro. Sierra chooses developers to work with the Spyro IP. Even though Insomniac created the Spyro IP they don't have ownership to it."
6then why they say that spyro is insomniacs maskot?
13I know! Do you HATE ME, Dari!?
Ratchet and Clank are more insomniac's mascot, and they still don't own them.
Why would I hate you?
4I live in teh US
13Because we think differently
4I want to work for the curret holder of spyro
I don't have any problems with your opinion, I just wish you wouldn't take the fact that mine differs from your so badly.
13When why are we always fighting?
4If i worked for them i would make a comic for a few things
6not again
4Maybe tie in a few things
4And make a plot
4about the reboots
4And the new ones
4as one
6i now know one thing
4?
13DSD, I must let you know I'm comming down with something, so I cannot speak and type propperly
6we will never see the real spyro again
4Whatcha coming down with??
13I've got a sore througt, so I might be coming down with a cold
4aw
6im sad
4?
6:(
6for spyro
4Whats wrong?
13I've lost my voice
6call me crazy but i think that spyro is in heaven
6and we will find him when we die
13Spyro is NOT dead!
6im talking about the real life
4My god it's a cult of spyro
/me 4jumps in a window
6lol
6is this bad?
4Yes
/me 4pulls out his guns
6what do you mean with all this stuff
6?
4Well first
4you think Spyro is heaven
4Cult
4ou think whe ou die ou wil go there
4CUT
4*cult
4When you think Spyro is a god
4Cult
6i think that spyro is (in) heaven n
6not that spyro is a god
4>.>
4He died?
6for gods sake shut up
4You first
13Didn't you guts see the last scene in DotD?
6oh
4I did
4I watched Youtube
6theres anyone who can understand me?
4Not really
4The way i see it is Spyro gets ready for a fight with the Sorcerer but loses
6thats ok you are not the only one
4He is then trapped and another him in a whole another world is made
4This one happens to latter meet Cynder
4After that another one is made
4For Skylanders
4This one has 31 friends
4See theres going to be a army
4Spyro will need his others help
4And there friends
4For a battle with Evil
4And all the evil will come back
4For a big battle
13I think I need to undergo surgery. I can taste blood
6you just made a plot
4O.O
4Yes i did
4Uxie docter now
4Now Uxie don't say no
4See my plot would be cool
4It would tie in everything
13I would, but no doctor is avalable, becuase it's late. Besides, my fokes won't beleave me
6i made my first plot when i was 3 years old lol
4Uxie what kind of place is it?
4We have them all the time
6what time is in australia right now?
4Plus we have 911
13 12:30am
4And phones for nine one one
4Heck we have them all the time
6here is 18:08
4So Aggelos do you like my plot?
4It's 9:09 am here
6yeah
4My plot would bring back the three spyros
4And his friends
13A doctor can only be contacted during daylight hours unless it's serious. And I love the pilot
6but this plot is for TLoS
4Uxie i swear if you die i'ma going to ban your account
4No it's for all
6it doesnt look like an original spyro plot
13I can never convince my family to take me to a doctor, since they think of it as a regular cold
4See the last game in the first Spyro
4Second he ends up with Cynder
6of coursw
4Third he is a hero of many lands
13It's not deadly. I'll be alright
6course
4So a comic should have the second and third finding out about this
4And then meeting each other
4And then a game should happen
4You know bring back evryone for one last fight
4Then you can let it go from there
6yeah its nice
6i want bentley and sgt. bird
13I cannot watch today's E3 (if it's on), 'cause I have to be in bed eary tonight
!isukra
:(
6and this space monkey
6(i cant remember his name)
6 6ekana metafrasi
6translation doesnt work
6im bored i gotta live byeeee
13Agent 9. That's his name
wHAT HAPPEN?
Eh i'm guessing it ended with me leaving and then our friend leaving
13Well, I'm probabally going to take time off
03:3
Also you could be bleeding for the fact your throat might be dry
ok
13You know, to get some rest
Drink water
13Okay

Sleep well
13Gracias! Night!

03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
14can we not have some little chitchat going on or something?
mhm
Nah, busy watching ponies.
!may
pony addict
!espeon
Floofcat!
Yeah, pretty much.
Series finished and I need my fix of PONIES! :P
14I wanted to watch the ponies, but I don't get the channel D:
14which fails
14majorily
;p
Ponies are coming to UK, so I might finally get them on TV!
http://steamcommunity.com/id/floofcat/ <- oO
14~
Before the series had finished I watched the episodes as some bronies streamed them live when they were first aired.
Was pretty cool.
/me noms on Espeon
What's with the My Little Pony craze?
!may
14I dunno
14prolly 'cause they look more animeish
I just like the cartoon, I don't know.
14I prefer the old-fashioned sparkle-your-skin versions of them |D
arti dont come here anymore?
14she does, and she has a life too
liez
Oh great
May: Really? Most people react to <G4 ponies with "KILL IT WITH FIRE!". :P
Midnight thunderstorm here
^
14Yeah
14I love the G4 ponies
The old ones?
g4?
G4 are the newest ones.
Ah
The earlier ones kind of scare me.
why are ppl obsessed with ponies
14no, G5 is the newer
14I thought it was
You sure? I'm 99% sure it's G4 latest.
14Charizard, I dunno, it's a craze I guess
Yeah, FIM is G4.
14The one with the baby dragon in it?
Spike, yeah.
that it is
Charizard: I dunno, if you want to know what it's about, watch it. :P
14I just like all of them except the G2 and G1 series
im to old to be watching that.
14I played with them when I little
14so
Lol, most of the fans are 18-34.
thats a shame
ill be a fan of pokemon not mlp
14lol that's why people collect them
Someone posted a good CS Lewis quote recently, let me find it.
14like they do with beanie babies
"Critics who treat adult as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."
CS Lewis was a pro. :P
sounds like somewhat a cop out to me
no one should care what you do
/me reads that and gets inspiration
but im not going to be out there HEY I LOVE POKEMOn
LOOK AT ME
Maybe I should be less embarassed about myself still liking a few things from my childhood
14There's a stamp I like, it says "Cartoons. Consider this, ADULTS make 'em."
Not just Pokémon
14I love that stamp
anyone?
/me coughThomasTheTankEnginecoughcoughcough
but its like saying gay pride
14uhm
what do you have to be proud of
14Not really
then your missing the point
14I go around saying I like Pokemon all the time
to strangers?
14People don't care, a lot of times people agree with me
14Yeah
14to strangers
so you randomly say it
14No
ok then
14when they mention it, I say I love them
that makes sense
14Besides, why would they mention Pokemon in the first place if they didn't have some kind of experience with them? :>
Charizard: I think the gay pride is just about not being ashamed of who you are.
that applies to what cs lewis said
is what im saying
its radically different
4hey
god its so hot around here
14I have to go out soon and work for the day
14I go to move some sheep to the neighbors so they can go graze in the pasture
14I have to go catch a filly so we can clip her

4And so More Spyro's are made
4And so they free them selfs

;.;
no its not sucks its how the original spyro has to be

LIGHTY!
.noooooooooo
hey Hipster
I'm testing something different today
8whoa
8people in here
also getting the movies for Friday
WAS A BITCH
8oh, this is DCD?
8gotcha
so what do you think of this here video feed?
testing the off chance of making DS games Let's Play
8i dont really notice anything different
8other than the fact that there are video games instead of movies
it's a Nintendo DS game I'm streaming right now
so I have the two screens next to each other
rather than one on top of the other
8ah, ok
8for some reason, the stream keeps stopping on me
8it isnt lagging or anything
8just stopping and making me press the play button
try refreshan
8Oh
8i meant to ask you
8do you think i should but up the selection thread tomorrow to give people more time to enter?
weren't we going to have the selection live, though?
8right
8but
8we still need to have people enter, and it's easier for me if we do it as a selection thread
ah
I see
8we'll just say you have to be present to win
have the OFFICIAL ENTRIES in the thread
I see
that said
Will I be streaming the ballot?
8ballot?
whatever you use for the random selection
since it's gotta be streamed live and all
8i just put them in a list organizer and randomize it, there's not really anything to watch
8plus, if we did it that way, it would show all the winners at once, and that houldn't be very dramatic
there's a way to work through that
8it shouldn't take nearly as long as the normal one with people all in chat
and I thought we were doing it that way to prevent accusations of foul play?
that said
what program do you use?
8http://www.random.org/lists/
8i was just going to screencap it if it became an issue, i don't think anyone seriously thinks its corrupt except maybe turnibrony
See what I' doing?
*I'm
it could make
8ah ok
for an exciting game
8ok, here's what we can do
okay
this seems like the best way
see what I'm doing?
just zooming in seems to work wonders
just gotta set up a borderline
8I'll keep an eye on the selection thread and add names to a word file, then email it to you as an attachment when the movie is over
8looks good to me
there
makes for an exciting method
for the viewers, I mean
since they don't know who might win
might actually help increase viewership a bit
considering it also becomes a "game"
8yeah
8ok, so that's settled
yes
slowly but surely
8i'll put it up tomorrow morning
we'be becoming the stream of streams
Sneas: Possibly
8the selection thread
>suddenly DAT THEME
BRB DANCIN'
8lol
8sounds like the final lap of a mariokart course
8why does the other guy get punched in the face every time you make a sound argument?
RULE OF COOL is basically the driving factor in the Ace Attorney universe
that, and WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S NOT AWESOME?
8lol
8but only in my office lol
8you can commit murder somewhere else and i wont care
8SUDDENLY TECHNO
sSuddenly, INVESTIGATION 2009 -PRESTO-
that means this is the last stretch
8i have never even heard of these games before
it's weird you have never heard of the Ace Attorney series
it really is quite popular
you might have heard of it as "Phoenix Wright"
8*shrug* im not much of a gamer
not to mention a lot of posts in Ponychan are related to this
8i had never heard of phoenix wright until i posted on Ponychan
like...Phoenix Spike
8i havent played a non-sports video game in years, other than the occasional COD session at my friend's apt
YEOWCH. BURN.
8you fail lol
DAT FINGER POINTAN
8all i can think of is "YOOOOOOU!"
8fucking soulja boy
8also, shouldn't they be interrogating this guy at the police station or something?
Ace Attorney is definitely not realistic, but lots of fun
also, not a "suspect", since Portsman IS the prosecutor in charge of THIS investigation
8and now comes the fun part, waiting 2-3 months for the lab work on the blood sample
6ICY! :D
8solved with the power of deus ex machina
ITS HOT AS ALIEN BALLS IN HERE
It's ALWAYS Murder
8fun fact: murder is the only crime
also this plane is so fucking awesome
I wanna fly in one of these ;__;
8had this muted for a minute while i listened to a song
8come back, unmute...
8my hearing is gone
try refreshing
8refreshing my hearing?
8lol
it probably is just the player
06~~
I mean
you were JUST listening to a song
so yeah
8nah, this thing is always loud
8i have the volume at 15
8and its decently loud

/me 6sighs and follows.
/me plants 9000.01 landmines behind him....and 900 SAM;s, Flack guns and AA miniguns in case she flies behind him
6Lol.
6And Nick, how do you have 0.01 of a landmine?
6I was making a pseudo-reference to Portal 2. :P
6As well as it being true.
it's small
/me 6backs away slowly
6I see.
6Hmm...
/me 6flies in front of Nick, then.
o-o
how'd you avoid all my AA batteries? D:
6I flew. :P
6And plus, I know nothing about whatever machinery you laid out.
I emphasize 'AA' batteries (anti aircraft)
6AA batteries? :P

6Ovo

6Nothus..Just a precaution..
but yeah

04I need a programmer ;-;
VLC or anything else won't work
04For Actrionscript mainly
6Hipster, you get my PM?
/me 6isn't one. :<
8yeah
04:c
/me sadface
12Oh ok...

12*gets closer*
6D:
/me 6backs away again
/me 12pounces
6NUUUUUUU
/me 6rolls over and escapes

and watch in a browser pop.up, though
/me 6continues to watch BlameTruth

burr
/me 6chirps.

8bye dcd
6I cannot.

12And I treat mates very well
6Also interesting..
6But why..why should I forget ze person and my ex cat?
12Won't matter with me baby, you'll forget everything
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone

haha, what was it before?
red shoryu
even though I hate kacheeks yay I got a kacheek av
/me 6has a bad feeling about the object that's to be hunted.
Why do you want a PS3 so much?
what will be streamed?
6Generally cause I just do and..Idk..graphics,be able to get new games seeing as nothing new gets made for PS2..Guess that mainly..
6I need to get the order real quick.
6I forgot the order. Xd
6*XD
6Ok..these reasons just sound pretty lame but anyway..
Haven't turned my PS3 on in over a month, haha.
I'll probably buy Skyrim when it comes out though.
6Party of One, Super Mario Bros Movie, Young Frankenstein, Over a Barrel
12I need more ps3 games...
6Skyrim?
6I need to try out new games..All these years I've just been stuck on Spyro and Sims.. .-.
The newest "The Elder Scrolls" game.
6Aah
With dragons. :)
03o.o
8ypu
Although you kill them.
8yup*
But meh, still dragons.
6xD Nice :P
12I no wanna kill dragons D:
6Yet you kill puppys?
I think maybe not all of them try to kill you, they hinted that.
12I kill puppies no more
6:O
6How come dear Icy?
I wonder if they'll release a MLP game
That'd make consoles 20% cooler.
And I'd get that game in 10 seconds flat.
6I had forgotten about that music! D:
6Btw,what's MLP? >.<
My Little Pony.
o.o
12Dari, do you think Marvel vs Capcom 3 is a good game?
6I wonder what you could possibly do in such a game.. o.o
Never played it Icy.
o.o
12I think it's boring, I might sell it
12G4?
That's the current cartoon ponies.
On the Hub.
The previous ones are...Eugh...Creepy.
12Is hub owned by hasbro? I think so
6xD
Yeah.
o.o
6Aah,the joy..
8,11C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
12Makes sense seeing as all there toy inspired shows are there
6Getting a pony,making it pink and shiny and just skipping around happily on a fluffy cloud..
6xD
Lawl.
12Been a while since I smoked... god it's painful
12Drugs are bad kiddies
/me 6would ask for suggestions but doesn't want to get her hopes up.. ._.
6I honestly had forgotten which episode was playing first, and which was playing last. XD
Suggestions for what?
6Games..
Well everyone seems to rave about the Uncharted games, I haven't played them though.
12GET BLACK OPS YO!IT'S COOL CUZ U SHOOT GUNS N SHIT
6I liked the look of Uncharted 2 when I saw the add..
6I want to.. :P
12D:
6:P
6And MW2..
12Meh if that's what your into
8eh, it happens
6Yeah..I took a liking to it..
12Transformers war for cybertron is pretty fun
I really loved MW2 to be honest.
Didn't like Black Ops, didn't really get into that.
6MW3 looks kinda cool
Apart from zombies, that was fun.
6Yeah,I prefered MW2 too..
6Zombies scared the shit out of me when they crept up behind me..
12I'd rather play a zombie survial game I wanna get lfd2 for da pc
Because they screwed up quickscopes on Black Ops probably was why I didn't like it. That was the main reason I played MW2 after I'd played the crap out of it already.
Hacks on MW2 were fun as well.
6I generally just liked MW2 more..Idk why..
Zombie mode. XD
Awesome.
Quickscope lobbies were the best part though.
Hey
Everyone being forced to use the intervention and only being allowed to quickscope, was so much fun.
6I wish in the Multiplayer it wouldn't put the same levels so many times..I got sick of Wasteland and Favela or whatever.. -.-
6I need to get out of my camping habits on CoD.. -.-
When I first started I hated SnD. When I'd played it for ages already that was all I'd played. XD
was all I'd play*
6So far I've only played DMs and something with bombs..
12Dead island looks wicked
Probably demolition.
6Dead island?
6I think so..
6SnD,you just kill whoever you see in front of you?
Weekdays. lol
That's all that's left that's fun in the game after a certain point.
bilge dice is robbing me
I lost 4500 np so far
Trying to get cool killcams. XD
BUT I CANT STOP
6:O
D:
6xD
don't get addicted to gambling!
MUWAHAAHAH
Lol.
:P
Wager your house!
6Never even thought of quickscope till I saw it a few days ago..
I played that game three or four times
ok I just earned 2k back hopefully I can get back on top
Lost all of them
then gave up
12Rawrs i don't get it
XD
I have a short attention span
Final killcam just going for the 360 no scope. XD
6Whatever though..I'd just find some window,go prone and just try and snipe whoever went past..
DIFFERENCE HERE: I'M HOME ALL DAY, I NEED NEOPETS TO LIVE
6xD
I'm home all day too
Hahaha, that gets boring eventually though.
YEAH well you're an ~adult~
School's out and still no job
So I'm pretty much a teenager now
:P
Whenever I'm bored I can just rewatch pony episodes. Problem solved. (:
I am a small child with gaming needs
6I know..I'm just so useless when I go out there that they kill me right away so I took to camping around.. :P
6Well,when I played Black Ops I tried playing normally..didn't do too bad actually.. :3
Dolphin dives are so pointless.
I don't get why they put them in.
12Whenever I play online I commit suicde for fun
If you could shoot while diving it'd be fun.
12And look bad ass
Yeah.
6Are dolphin dives only on PC version?
Dive through a window while shooting someone.
6I was wondering about that..So you can only shoot once you've hit the ground?
6:O I never got something telling me how to do it on PS3.. o.o
You hold the crouch button to do it.
While running.
6That thing where you throw a knife into the air and it goes all the way to the other side of the level and actually hits someone is insane.. o.o
Haha, they're pretty funny yeah.
6Aaah..Maybe I'll get to try it at somepoint..Normally shouldn't it tell you in Campaign Mode how to do it or something?
04hihi
Probably does, can't remember.
Campaign was alright in Black Ops actually.
6Indeed
I just don't really like the online.
03http://i.imgur.com/f9jCV.jpg
03guess who that is
6I didn't get too much of the online actually..
6-.-
I probably played zombies more than normal online.
6I wonder why MW2 is 18+ and Black Ops 16+..Black Ops has more nasty-ish scenes or whatever..Idk..
6In Zombies,the furthest I've gotten is like Round 3..I gave up on it afterwards and started DMs..
Oh, lol.
6Kino der Toten looks like a cool place though..I only played in the Pentagon..
You mean Five?
6Guess..Idk..The zombie thing in Campaign.. :P
/me dances around
Some old guy:
I'd say probably the best game I've played on PS3.
14My god there's some awesomesauce Zebstrika art on dA
/me looks at the Snivy
6Lol :P
Other than the online for MW2.
6What's it like
Oh wait, it's DRF XD
14that's just cruel :|
6:O
6*?
You can smile?!
/me runs
14LOL HML
It's a Rockstar game, so the same sort of engine as GTA games, free roaming, LOADS of side missions and extra things to do, ect.
Except it's a western style game.
6:O :O :O
The graphics are absolutely awesome, some of the scenery in the game is just amazing.
It has a hell of a lot of gameplay time too, as well as an online (though I didn't play that much).
6Not that crazy about the western thing but I definitely like the free roaming and side missions..
6:O
6So basically everything I'd like in a game..Awesome :O
You can tie people up, put them on train tracks to get squished and stuff like that.
(:
6Woo! :D
There's also a fair number of minigames too.
6Sounds great :3
Poker, five finger fillet, liar's dice, arm wrestling.
You can break in wild horses and stuff like that.
6Nice :3
But yeah, I really enjoyed RDR.
NP earned today: -6000
WOOHOO
12Dammit I can't find my ps3 :(
You...Lost a PS3?
6I'll keep it in mind.. :3
6xD
As in...Negative?
yup
CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE TODAY'S BIG WINRAR!
12No, my grandfather moved it and I have no idea where he but it
I just won 3000 back though
so w/e
6F.E.A.R. looks quite nice too.. :O
03not...really

12Numbskull! >:L

CS Lewis is awesome.
/me ~NP: Gradius III - Uncharged Territory (Level 10)

I loved Chronicles of Narnia when I was younger
Same.
Kind of wished they hadn't skipped out a lot of the books in the movies.
Yeah, I know
I've actually never read the books
and I've only seen the first movie
8im back
Hm, you should read them sometime, it's worth the time investment.
Some of the would be kind of hard to make into good movies, to be fair
Like the first one
6welcome back

I am He-Man's protege.
Oh right.
6?
Well I'm leaving now anyway.
Though before I do.
I think cupcakes is kind of overhyped, it's not as bad as it's made out to be, and a few people think (like I do) that's it's pretty funny. The puns were good.
Night, cya both later.

8the 1st few seasons are definitely worth watching
11Cool.
04ugh windows XP mode is costing me a gigabyte.
04I wish XP mode could be on my I:/ drive.
04seriously though WHY does Windows need to take up 19.6 GIGS?!
8the simpsons was good until they started bringing in new guest stars every single week
8family guy was good until it got cancelled
GUess what, it's 64bit :P
Which is why it takes up so much darn space .c.
!pokemon
okay well that works
11Well, with Family Guy, I watched an episode from Season 7, where they parodied And Then there were None. The humor was incredibly lacking, though the plot was fucking badass.
11Of course, this is all in my personal Opinion.
Had some issues with the server
10lolfail
and heya Skylands
8the problem was that after they came back from cancellation, they never connected the jokes to the plot
8all the humor was just random non-sequitors
10hi NS
;p
;p
XD
10Script reactivation fail
But it'll pair DRF
Which is a win
10k
odd
!shipping
:P
No
that's a disturbing pairing
Apparently yes.
not really
I can think of worse
Oh well
such as you x me
now that's just silly
11Oh yeah, those stupid cut-ins that half of which are all celebrity appearances.
03!pokemon

8yeah, its terrible
8the best episode is the one where peter becomes a tobacco lobbyist
11I seen that one.
11It's the one where a smoking company takes over Peter's workplace.
11I forget, is the Wonka parody before or after the cancelation?
8i think after
11'cause I really like that one.
03bbl
XD
8what happens in it?
seeya
!pokemon

12rawr
Kosoveon, you are a 7Drilbur.
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 5 minutes

:3
11It's a parody of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where they replace the chocolate factory with the pawtucket brewery. It's doubled with a plot of Lois trying to win a piano competition and finds that when peter's drunk, he kicks ass on the piano.
8oh, i remember now
!pokemon
8thats pre-cancellation i think
:3
!pokemon
11Of course, I could be biased as I freaking LOVE that movie.
8willy wonka?

okay, bbl
lmao Manly
8people in the store stared and i didnt even care
true
now poof
bbl
Not if you're on pony IRCs like I am.

02lmfao Manly. So much truth.
Poof back to me. I already miss you, NS. ):
Lol, Ray. Still homeworking?
8so i did

I've cheated death over 10 times RL. That already classifies me as manly. lol
8HAHA!
04ROFL
02yeah, math is so much fun. </sarcasm>
8successfully brought my attention horse thread back from the dead
11....I'm also annoyed how the toy looks like a G3 pony...
11Hasbro, you are full of fail.
You should... not do it, and play Brawl with me.
Cheating death isn't manly, punching it in the face is.
11BUt it's twilight. *squee* :D
04^
11....I've never felt so gay in my life. XD
Haha, I won't get it into it.
04Brawl isn't manly.

That's some manly stuff right there. ^
/me 11is brushing Twilight's hair. >.>

8lol, dont even know what that is
11It's an all-purpose seasoning. Google it. :P
8sounds tasty
11Yep. and I use in just about everything now.
Someone needs to have their arms chopped off
/me gets out chainsaw
04Why not just drive that truck?
8i make a casserole where we season some chicken with cumin, paprika, garlic powder and pepper
8its incredible, if i do say so myself
11Nice. :D
Because you can't sneak up on them with a truck?
11Adobo is my quivilent to Muriel's Vinegar. XD
Not to mention gas a keys XD

Wow
If only Ash from Pokemon were the Ash from that series.
11...
11Sure, why not
11?*
You know, that'd make pokemon about 20% cooler.
11If vinegar can make Taffy taste good, I'm sure Adobo can make Cake taste good.
I'd watch it. lol

11So is Ace Attorney just a game about court procedings?
GODDAMNIT EDGY, YU GOTTA BANG THEM GURLS
no
That article, HML. Very informative.
yes Astray
it's a game about court AWESOME
DYNAMIC DS STREAMING SYSTEMU
but Ashtray
this game has no
court scenes
SILENCE MAGGOT.
also
TL;DR
IT CANNOT BE
>yfw the devs said "Edgeworth does not liek women"
YOU MEAN I CAN'T OBJECTION!!?
then again they didn't say he likes men
you can
11Oh, I know court is awesome. I watch Law and Order, CSI, NCIS, another acronym show, Judge Judy, Judge Mathis, Judge Doom...
but the CROSS-EXAMINATIONS are done in the Crime Scenes
LIKE A BOSS
but BroCD
also >yfw Edgy does not like women, but likes girls
nooooot really
that's Phoenix
doing Maya and Pearls
:3c
There's Kay in this game tho'
PEDOLAWYER
PoS article, haha.
actually
Edgy is Nicksexual
that should be obvious for everyone
and Franziska....
OH LORD THAT WHIP
in fact, everyone in this series but Godot is Nicksexual
what about the AJ Cast?
8FUCK PRESERVING THE CRIME SCENE, IM GONNA RUN THROUGH THIS POOL OF BLOOD
that's Grape Juice actually
AJ cast is Klaviersexual
8i thought one part was grape juice and one part was blood

>not ALL CAPS
DUDE D:
11Still, it's quite annoying if everything you post is in all caps, especially if you post five times in a row like you just did.
that's like telling a drug addict to get healthy
but being annoying is my highest-leveled skill :3c
he's also the Brave Troll King

UNSW, Drake? xD

probably usyd or unsw though
other my mum will piss ;x
otherwise*
if you study hard and make it into the same one I'd be happy ;p
04lol
04I was actually thinking about AIT or AIE
04Maybe UTS
04They all have good courses in IT, Games design/development and Website development/design.
AIT or AIE?
and UTS is what?
/me forgot
I remember it
I had a maths test that I epically fucked up today, so my brain isn't functioning
04AIT = Academy of Information Technology
...ah
04AIE = Academy of Interactive Entertainment
04I'm definately leaning towards AIT
04Isn't UNSW in Sydney anyway?
duh
04If it is then I don't think it'll matter if we're not at the same Uni.
True
04WE CAN JUST VISIT EACH OTHER
:DDDDDDDDDD
if you get into UTS you'll be pretty fucking close
04Still it'd be epic if we could like, trash the classroom together.
depending on what I get into though
lmao
we should hack into your uni's network 8D
04"YO MISS! I THINK YOU DROPPED YOUR POCKET!"
04Heckyes
lmao
04Although I don't know how to 'hack'
heh
you'll learn
Lol, then get arrested for it, sounds great. :P
not if no one knows ;D
Hmm.
04XD
but Drake
Should just make everything redirect to Rick Astley. XD
it'd be like totally fucking awesome if we got into the same uni
lmao
04I know right?

13I can't seem to go a day without seeing something mlp-related these days
13then again, it can't be helped when a lot of people on TST are using mlp-related avatars/signatures and such |D
I MUST RESIST M.L.P. F.i.M.
SO WHY AM I WATCHING IT
SODHFIHJSDOAIJOAKJWDOIJWEF
13I mean, I like the show and all
13but I'm not obsessed or anything
13I just watch it when I feel like it :B
06And that's awwrite.
WHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
PONYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON

/me banished.
You know, I got a crazy idea just now
Do a comic
13Speaking of Portal, I've been watching a Portal 2 walkthrough to find out why it's so popular
showing various characters from other works of fiction
13now I can see why, since it's full of all kinds of humour |D
being put through Aperture Science Enrichment Center tests
Hahaha.
06Yeah.
13wouldn't play it myself though, but I could easily watch someone else play it all day considering they're good at it :B
06But that would be quite funny
eg. Pokémon, My Little Pony, Sonic, Harry Potter, Ben 10, Star Wars, etc. etc.
13The main reason I wouldn't play it is because portals confuse the hell out of me, but I'm kinda starting to understand how they work by watching the gameplay |D
Put a Mudkip through the test
13but still, I'd constantly get stuck at every puzzle :B
Put Sonic the Hedgehog through the test
Put Guilmon through the test
06but the satisfaction when you figure it out
Put Lord Voldermort through the test
06what
Put Darth Vader through the test
etc.
Also Princess Celestia
/me RUNS
Oh, and the Duke
/me hides
06Put Gabe Newell through the test.
I still can't imagine
Lord Voldemort doing an Aperture Science test
Magic + Science = ...
06It's like matter and antimatter
That actually sounds like something I'd like to see.
I wonder if he could try to use the Killing Curse to hax his way through
Whut
I can't let my sister find out about this

Or she will tease me FOREVER

06the tags on the Friday video is a trainwreck so it's not that
06HMM
If I dream of ponies tonight I'm checking myself into the mental ayslum immediately
I want
a
Nightmare Moon
pony figure
on my desk
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hasbro kind of fail at the toys BTW.
They made Celestia pink.
>_>
Also, I don't think they make NMM toys.
Not that they'd make them right if they did.
I WANT NIGHTMARE MOON
NAO
AND HAVE NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
FOREVER
Then you need to make one. :P
:(
I think I saw a custom NMM toy somewhere.
I saw
But
:(
They really don't have Nightmare Moon figures
PETITION HASBRO TO MAKE ONE GUYS
I doubt they'll listen to you.
They can't even make Celestia's colour right, so I don't think they'll make a whole new toy.
...
;
EW
EW MLP >>
INB4 whine about ponies.
Damn, so close.
Too late
Not whine
Share my opinion
About a stupid old fad
;p
That's not sharing your opinion, that's whining.
You provide no explanation, no justification, nothing except "EW".
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aCDtxPUGPQ
I don't care that you don't like it, but it tends to get annoying when all you ever do is say "EWW MLP" whenever someone's talking about it.
You're whining about how there aren't enough toys :P
And I posted my opinion on the thread about mLP
*MLP
First two comments I made about toys.
I don't frequent the forums, I wouldn't know, all I ever see from you is "eww".
Well do you want me to post a paragraph every time you talk about MLP XD
Maybe just the first time.
Other than that you could do what everyone else does and ignore it if you don't like it.
[17:10] That's not sharing your opinion, that's whining. "Whining? I am not whining, I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS IIIIIIIIIIIIS WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINIIIIIING"
:O
Oh nies
caps
Cruise control for cool, amiright?
Nightmare Moon
NIGHTMARE MOON
NIGHTMARE MOON
NIGHTMARE MOON
NIGHTMARE MOON
NIGHTMARE MOON
NIGHTMARE MOON
O_o
/me hides
Yeah, that's whining
I concur.
And no
Capslock is not cool
NOW SHIFT IS THE FUTURE
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
/me portals to the moon
Even when I talk about using caps lock I actually use shift, lawl.
Rainbow Dash >..
Worst character design ever
Is it a boy or girl
I dunno
I just want Nightmare Moon
I don't care
Hahaha, all the main characters (other than Spike) are female.
</addicted>
Serious
They all look MALE
You probably haven't seen a male pony for comparison though.
They're pretty scarce. :P
Does Dr. Whooves..hrm
No, she's a girl too
No, Dr Whooves is male.
HOW ARE THEY ABLE TO REPRODUCE
/me flees
Magic of course. (:
Magic is over when the final HP movie comes out
/me uses 'magic' to erase MLP from TVZ
*TV
I thought JK was writing loads of new books.
And history
About the children of all the main characters, including Dudley's son or something.
KILL IT WITH FIRE!
NOW!
God those things are creepy.
/me is finally finished with school :3
xD
13I hate when people don't bother controlling their kids
13I went next door to buy something to eat, and there was this kid running around taking stuff off the shelves and screaming
13and his mum and her friend were just stood laughing like it was a joke
thats mean
13I was only in there for like 2 minutes but I already have a headache from the screaming -.-
A child was screaming for the WHOLE flight "I don't want to die!".
Impressive that he kept it up, by God I wanted to rip my ears off.

hi hi
Hello everypony!
hello?
yo
8sorry, was commenting on a ponychan thread
8and also having a conversation with somepony on facebook
I see, So waht are the movies tommorow?
8young frankenstein and super mario bros
I think we should just Ban Clock La for the pure fact she's useless
LOL
Hahaha, I like the way you decide to ban members RDX.
I'm not sure if you're joking, but I don't think so
Depends
she openly swears and does nothing but annoy people
it's starting to bug me
ok, haha I'm having a friend over and were going to watch them (While I passively mod)
She's not really doing anything wrong
8nice
8im going to be struggling to stay awake
so she's allowed to swear now?
and we can't really afford to be banning members for no reason considering the number we have
8i have to be up at 6 am on saturday to run a football camp
Yeah, if she lets the filter catch it
there's never been a rule against that
Eh
in that case I just think she's annoying as sin
Do you want to run the camp or are you being forced? haha
8kind of both
I don't find her annoying for some reason
8i want to run it, but i dont want to wake up that early on a saturday
Usually I think those kinds of people are annoying
I have no idea why I don't feel the same about her =/
Well it's not really a huge reason to be annoyed
I honestly shouldn't care
I don't think she's ever posted a single relevant post. Lawl.
8im gonna miss most of next week too cuz i have to run another camp from 5:30-10 pm on friday
8next weeks BMN i should say
but people who simply choose to be stupid when they have the ability to be a little more intelligent about how they act generally annoy me to high heaven
but eh, that's prolly just cause the forum is boring
yeah
Spyroforum is also kind of known for having hard-ass mods
well it's not really being hard ass
I just dont' see any point in which she is relevent about anything
I've seen her make on-topic posts
she just posts so she can be loud and obnoxious really, but that's prolly just my conservative brain pattern
Obnoxious, sure, but keep in mind I was friends with SFRB
8btw, you know about the change in our selection format, right?
Can't get much more obnoxious than that
No? What changed?
This is true
But in essence I find such members useless
but not much I can do
excessive swearing however even with the censors will annoy me
8we are doing the selection for next week live during intermission tomorrow
8the entry thread is already up
8and I'm inclined to start having our discussion stuff in there as well to keep it bumped
I see, Live huh? Thats gonna be intense
whats going on in here? Mumble is down =(
I know Treesap, IKNOW!
8hi treesap
hi
oh my thunderstorms
everywhere!
Thunderstorms? and why is the Mumble down?
8yo, just sent off the email to Sethisto
8hi sprinkles
6Hey
8thats why you really became a mod, isnt it bristle?
8dunno if you saw, sprinkles, but i just sent the email about BMN to Sethisto
7Well duh, Color makes me fabulous, and I love being Fabulous
6Yeah, I saw.
oh, and bristle i posted on your thread again
it was too long to type in here.
6!!Rarity autosaged my We Love !!Rarity thread...
8lol
hi
6Apparently the mods don't want ponychan becoming all about them.
8fair enough
8although they did archive the !!PinkiePie one
6The argument for that was that !!PinkiePie did something far above and beyond the call of duty to earn that thread.
8thats true
hi
6Whereas !!Rarity sat in one thread banning people for three hours straight.
8btw, sprinkles and bristle, mod meeting at 6 PM EST tonight
6I saw.
how r u?
6And planned to be there anyway.
7Fuck, what is it about?
8getting stuff straightened out before tomorrow night
6YOUR SOUL
8I emailed DCD and asked him if he could do a test drawing tonight to make sure it runs smoothly
6I was going to suggest that...
7Ok then, My friend wont mind watching us meet, and he brought he's bringing his own computer so he should be good
03*WB02(Kyu02)03WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD
6*refresh /oat/* New post in the Mod Discussion thread? Must be important! *checks* Oh.
8cool beans
8lol
8you saw mine, right?
6Yeah.
8before the last one
6Ghosties!
4We can never have a set time for meetings lol
6Never.
6Meetings here are 20% more sporadic.
8thats just how we roll
4It appears so
?
4...who are the rest of these people?
8*ponyshrug*
6They've come to take you away Ghosties.
6To the funny farm.
8pallaskitten has been doing the dari lurk all week
4Back to the Funny Farm?
8dari is... well... dari
6Indeed.
4I don't mind
who whached dr who last week?
i havent
darilurk?
/me 6just ran out of food...
6It's when you don't leave the chat all week, just go afk
4But dari is the chatroom
/me ran out of burger buns and now needs to use sandwitch bread
oh, okay
4But we don't talk about that
8dari is never not in the chatroom
4Pretty much
6Well, there was that one time his computer got unplugged.
6We must find out if the chat went down when that happened. Probably did.
belive me river song mistry will blow your mind
4Nah, I was around
4dari has powers, man
6Magic powers.
6That allow him to post in RAINBOW.
4Yes
i got her right 4 thime gessing
4The lucky bastared
4*bastard
8even though he's half-op
4Pretty much
8curse that man and his knowledge of computers
4Hip, were you around for the "voice your honest opinion on the community" thread last night in /oat/?
8i dont think so
he' sprolly using some mIRC script
8if it was posted after 10:30, i probably didnt see it
4Ah
6He is, pallas
8theres some guy making rules for ponychan that are really good
8like a 10 commandments type of deal
6Oo
6Where?
8his 1st one is "love and tolerance. But remember, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself"
6Must. See. This.
4I actually added to the "commandments"
6Thread is tl;dr
6But looks interesting.
4Even if I am wary over the thought of an "OFFICIAL COMMANDMENTS OF LOVE AND TOLERANCE FOR BRONIES"
iv got a hawk orded :)
8i lost the thread
8i got in a heated argument with someone on facebook and stopped paying attention to ponychan for a while
6Hipster, I'm derailing your thread. Deal with it.
4Boy, it's a good thing that I'll be there for the event tomorrow. I thought for sure that Bristle wasn't going to make it, and Hipster won't be around for most of the event
4Hopefully Bristle will be around though, since it seems like things are somewhat better for him now. By the way, how is your mom?
7My mom? it was my grandfather haha, and he's fine, thank you
6Info fail!
8ghosties, i'll be here this week
8next week i will miss most of it
8also, sprinkles, your derail was for the best
4Oh, well, I feel like a dunce.
4But at least my prayers were in the right place
8good to hear that he's ok, bristle
7No problem Ghosties, info gets messed up on the grapevine XD, but yeah I'm all cool
4Thanks, Bristle. Glad he's feeling better.
4Oh, Hip, I thought you had work tomorrow till like 10 PM?
8nah, next week
8i have to get up at 6 am on saturday this week though, so i might have to dip out a little early
4Alright
8success
8i managed to derail the aforementioned heated facebook argument with a few well placed spiderman images
4What was the argument about?
4If I may ask
6Did you create a knifegun?
7Spiderman solves all problems
fresh off of equestria daily http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/
8it was about the proper role of government in the united states
8and i successfully derailed it with a "what the fuck am i reading?" image and two "nope" images
6That was slightly insulting.
4@Hipster: Ah, well it's a good thing that you were finally able to snuff out the flames of the argument then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OylhEA6Xx4Q LOL!
4What do you find slightly insulting, SirSprinkles?
6Just some of the stuff in the article.
6And only slightly.
4Like what?
7I liked the article, it twas good
8it was a little like "awww, isn't that cute, they like ponies"
8but i like the publicity
6I'm not saying I didn't like it, it just had moments that... what Hipster said.
4*shrugs* People aren't going to accept the fact that guys like G4 of MLP
4In fact, I suspect they never will
7Hey Treesap, guess what, Servers back online
6I'm rocking out to Avast Fluttershy's Ass in a public cafe. Some people keep looking at my screen every now and then, but nobody really cares.
4Perhaps it's not people, perhaps it's the media
4But then, Hasbro is finally starting to acknowledge that there's a fanbase outside of the targeted demographic
6It really is media, for the most part.
4But even still, I didn't really like that Hasbro acknowledged us so publicly
6They could have gone about it better, that's true.
7Maybe if those guys at Hasbro made Celestia's toy white, I would have more hope for better toys
8i was fine with it
how have they made it public? I haven't seen it anywhere
8i assume you're talking about the shout out in equestria girls
4Equestria Girls
except equestria girls
but even that was just one word
4Not just one word
4It was "bronies" and "DJ-P0N 3"
7 2 words
7bam
4Still, all I wanted was a discreet little merch bump
4I didn't want BIKINIS ON TOP, WITH MAH BRONIES and all that
6And it was so blatantly obvious it was directed at bronies.
4Exactly
6Even before the extended.
8im fine with it
8im glad they acknowledge us
7I want MLP plushies that look good, give me that and I will be happy
8it gives me hope that they will eventually release some decent merch
6I am too, it's all the media publicity that's related to it that I have an issue with.
8bristle, agreed
4I'm glad they acknowledge us too, but a mass shout out like that isn't what I'd call discreet
8i dont really care if it's discreet or not
4All I wanted was like cloths merch from Hasbro's site
4*clothes
4I didn't need them shoving Katy Perry in my face
7I already have a shirt haha, but its from ShirtBrony
4Bleh, I just hope the brony parade doesn't continue with Hasbro.
7So you don't want Hasbro to ackknowledge us so they will cancel the show after the second season?
4Whoa, what?
8katy perry = bad, brony shoutout = good
4I never once said that them not acknowledging us equals no season 3
7I'm just saying, Hasbro isnt known for keeping MLP on for many seasons
6CNN seeing it and getting all their info wrong = very bad
8lol
7No that I agree with Sprinkles
7*now*
6That's my main issue with the shoutout.
8also, i loved huffpo reporting that the presentation was done by "stephen magnet"
6They could have done it better.
7CNN doesnt give to shits about us, like they would take the time to get good info
4See what I mean? Hasbro made the acknowledgment so blatant with the media with Equestria Girls that all media outlets are gonna COMPLETELY blow our brony fandom out of proportion with how we operate
7*Two shits
6CNN doesn't get good info about ANYTHING EVER.
7Agreed
4It's gonna be Fox and 4chan all over again
6Precisely my point.
4Oh dear lord, if Fox gets ahold of us
7"Bronies like to pretend to be nice to people, for what they call "The Friendship" a sinster variation on frienship" That's what it would be like
6"They're going to "love and tolerate" us, all right. WITH BOMBS!"
7How did they find out our plan?
6That's when we go on their site and be like "Nope, with SONIC RAINBOOMS! 20% more damage in 10 seconds flat."
8its not like we were a secret group before
7And then.....Fire
4The fandom is gonna explode one day
6We're a cult following according to wikipedia.
7What do you mean....Explode?
wb Sky :3
6Explode and then explode again!
7 0_0
10Thanks
4I mean something's gonna give and our neat little community is gonna go in an uproar. Lauren Faust leaving was just a tiny excursion. I get the feeling that if we keep getting exposed like this, like mass exposure, there's going to be an eventual large scale rebellion against us. Think like the emos, or the scene kids
8TEXT WALL
4The world's gonna end up targeting any guy that likes MLP and will point us out to everybody to mock and laugh at
8>implying people don't already make fun of grown men who watch MLP
7Thats a bleak outlook, and dont they already do that for the most part?
06!shipping
06wb
4 Espeon is paired with Obsi
im finally on summer vacation :3
!shipping
!shipping
o-o
Hey guys im new
8also: http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b197/FinalValkyrie/Pinkie_Pie_haters_gonna_hate.gif
4I'm waiting for the day when convenience stores in a low income country won't allow a male over the age of 18 to buy from them if they like ponies
8i doubt we will ever see anti-pony laws
7Seriously, where are you coming up with this stuff XD
6...anti-pony laws XD
/me hugs Espeon
hi
/me hugs Obsi! :3
8i can see us becomign a much larger community, but not THAT big
I do not like Skylanders:Spyro's Adventure
8just got an email back from Sethisto, he's going to post us both today and tomorrow O_O
6Win.
6Also, wtf Mexico?
Cynder isn't in there.Spyro cant talk,Spyro is MUTATED
4...hmm, okay, it wasn't all of Mexico. But there were supposedly anti-emo groups beating emo people in the streets in Tijuana
8tijuana is a ridiculous place to begin with
4That's still bad, though
7Well Emos kinda suck, and Bronies are cool, also We would totally fight back
8im not sure that place has any laws
8bristle: win
4I agree, I don't like emos either but I don't go around beating them up for it
6brb guys, getting more food and I can't exactly leave my comp unattended in a cafe...
7Well yeah I don't beat them, but why do you think that were going to get beatin up? i mean just wut? I live in Ohio, there are no crazy Mexicans here
8MLP will never be that big
7We can hope....
04Hi Espy
8whoa bristle, i didnt know you lived in ohio
8me too
7:D
6WHOA
6lulz
4All I'm saying is that I really hope our community doesn't become the target of wide scale rebellion
4That's all
6I doubt it highly.
8i dont think you have anything to worry about ghosties
6The only people that really even slightly dislike us are the insecure idiots on 4chan.
6Everypony else either doesn't care or generally likes us.
lol
Lawl rage.
4...maybe.
4*shrugs*
7I mean I can see like crazy rednecks calling us 'FAGS' for liking MLP but there a minorty, alot of my non-brony friends think I'm pretty cool for liking it
Why do people think we like spyro?
06~~
6There are like, five or six bronies in my area. Most of the two towns LOVE us.
6Also, again, brb getting food. For realz this time.
8no one knows I am a brony IRL
4My best friend hates the show and probably hates the fandom
I'm going to assume that wasn't a serious question.
8bye sprinkles
4See ya Sprinkles
7By Sir S.
7*Bye*
8only a handful know i have even watched an episode
But you have to remember who your talking to
7Dude I wore my Luna cutie mark shirt to school, everyone who asked what it was, I told them I was part of a gang, we are called "Bronies" and instead of illegal activitys, we try to spread love and joy
8#winning
8i dont have the balls to do that
4There's no way I'd do that
o.o
/me flees again
8honestly, the only thing i would buy that i wouldnt care at all if anyone saw would be a large rainbow dash plushie
8if it were well made
7God, I want a well made Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, or Luna plushie it's not even funny
7*So bad it's not even funny*
8i know, same for me with a dash, twilight or scootaloo one
/me points to the channel name, and topic.
I don't get it....
7Scootaloo? bleh.
13!shipping
06.
4Dude, Scoot's got mad skills
13:3
04hawt
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130765191510.gif
/me RUNS
06Flawless victory.
7Sure she can ride a scooter, but that personality
4What of it?
4She's a tomboy
04yes |D
4Possibly Tsundere
8so what, big whoop, want to fight about it?
:P
7Fight time? Fight time.
4One of the biggest reasons why RD was my favorite pony at first is because she's Tsundere
8dont know what that means
4Tsundere means cold at first and generally unlikeable
4It's an anime term. Hell, I barely use it
4For all intents and purposes, RD's a tomboy and possibly rebel
4And that's why she was my favorite at first
8Dash is my favorite, i dont know why
CURSE YOU BRAIN YOU FAIL ME AGAIN!
8possibly because shes an athlete, and i'm in to sports
7I Heart Pinkie Pie
8welcome back sprinkles
4Welcome back SirSprinkles
ty
8pinkie pie annoys the ever loving shit out of me
7Mad?
7Mad.
4Shouldn't you like AJ since she's also something of an athlete, Hip?
8she reminds me sooooooo much of the sorority girls on campus here
6I am Pinkie Pie, irl.
8im not a big fan of southern accents
4Ah. Ironically, AJ's voice actor is Canadian
7Fluttershy is awesome to, wanna argue about that Hipster?
8thats also why i dont like applebloom (u mad, sprinkles?)
8i like fluttershy
6Nope.avi
4Pinkie Pie WAS my least favorite at first
8holy fuck
7Oh thank god, to much Fluttershy hate these days
8i just noticed something
6Fluttershy is awesome.
4What?
6Not in my top three, but still awesome.
8ok, so im assuming you all know the pinkie pie "haters gonna hate" gif
4Yeah
6Yeah...
06dc?
8shes wearing glasses, and the "arms" of the glasses dont go over her ears
7yep
8they're attached to nothing
7...
7wut.
8HOW DO THEY STAY ON HER FACE?!
6Pinkie Pie. Just that random.
4Don't think about it
7Pinkie is so great she can levitate them on her face....duh
4And what Sprinkles said
4Pinkie Pie can warp reality, and I've accepted that fact a long time ago
6Also, this world has crazy magic in it, and this worries you?
7Twlight gave Rarity Butterfly wings, your worried how Pinkie keeps glasses on her face?
4He has a valid argument. I used to wonder how Morpheus kept those damn glasses on without arms
8INORITE?
8that bugged me the whole movie
8it was like they were glued on
6You mean they weren't glued on?
6I just assumed they were.
4I just eventually succumbed to the idea that he's fucking Morpheus, and he can do whatever the hell he wants
8true
hurpaderp
8its because of the matrix
4That could also be true
8its a glitch in the computer program
4The glasses are in the Matrix, so it's possible he programmed the glasses to stay on his face at all times despite logic
8theres an anti gravity field around his eyes
4Oh my god
4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/src/130765248525.jpg
06Heya~
have a lugia plush!
8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3kQk-lgFRI
8this movie is a lock to eventually get selected for the B movie
6...Ghosties, where did you find that amazing image?
4Over in /pony/, under a "Superhero Pony" thread or something
7You know who else can do whatever they want to? Bill Murray
8yup
8like in space jam
8BILL MURRAY OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
4I used to hate Bill Murray
7Thats what I was referencing haha
8how could you ever hate bill murray?
8awesome
7Dont remeber the movie though
4I just thought Bill was annoying, but then I saw Space Jam again
4And I hadn't seen Space Jam in YEARS
8you know who else can do anything?
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130757539634.jpg
4And Murray was easily the very best damn character in that whole fucking film
Hmm.. not sure why I parted xD
tsk tsk
/me hugs Kitten
Hi
/me hugs
hi hi
:)
How have you been?
tired lol and you?
same
4Woo, people left
4Where did Bristle go?
8*ponyshrug*
8o hai silver
11Howdy.
11So I got to look at a would-be competitor for streaming movies yesterday.
6Hey Silver.
11Some people from /rp/ stream a movie every now and then and let the people RP in the chat.
4Sup Silver!
11Howdy, Ghosties. :D
11Anyway, the show didn't even happen because we had to wait for someone. Not the streamer, mind you. Just...someone.
4Is that the stream that airs MSTs?
8lol
8ive seen 2 or 3 competitors popping up
11I think we're safe from any competition.
sucky
11For some reason, none of them get organized before trying to do said event.
11And in the end, only like five people would show up.
/me nuzzles
4Yeah, there's that. We're a pretty organized event and we usually get around 200 people every stream.
/me nuzzles
8http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw
4I wouldn't say we have a lock on the competition, but...
Maybe I can give you all of my energy and then I can go rest or vice versa?
11We get so many people BECAUSE we're so organized.
11People know what we're showing, when were showing it, and just all around know what to expect when they come in.
4And we also advertize
lol it wont work i'm already partially dozing at the keys lol so i has no energy.. apparently we both need to rest
4advertise
11There's that to.
8we are channeling twilight in winter wrap up
4Yes
11...that's not true. I've yet to actually boss somepony aroun.
8oh, speaking of advertising
8silver
11Yessir?
8EQD is going to post us twice, once today and once tomorrow
11Awesome.
4Hey, Hip, you're on Facebook right?
11I put a post on yesterday's Daily /oat/ thread as well.
8i am ghosties
/me 11nomnomnoms some Ramen. :)
4Do you know what this is about?
/me nods
4http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35664995.html
11What the hell?
4If this is true, this just another tiny part of the eventual backlash
4*is just
11Pardon the french, but how the fuck are ponies offensive? o.O
11I've heard of strange accusations, but WOW!
8im guessing someone reported it
8a pony hater
11makes sense.
8they have had all kinds of shit like this happen
11All that needs to be done is send a letter to FB admins.
4 I tried to send Ponies to a friend to convert him, and it said that MLP was flagged as offensive. -what the guy said
8there was a big stink when they took down a picture of 2 men kissing because it was "offensive"
11I didn't hear of that one.
4I guess it could have been seen as advertising? I mean, I don't go on Facebook, so I don't know what their stance on it is.
4I'm referring to the guy sending ponies to his friend
4And Facebook's been getting flak for doing some low stuff recently, supposedly
4Silver's net is shitting out on him again lol
I don't know what it is, but I'm switching to mIRC again. brb.
4Alright
4....Lady Gaga wore ponies on a necklace?
6brb, have to reset my connection
6back
4I'll brb as well. We're not gonna be staring the meeting anytime soon, yeah? In that case, I'll return shortly
8yeah, lady gaga is a confirmed brony
/me 6chirps and nudges Nick.

8no problem, see you tomorrow
Hey all (gunna be here for a few minutes).
See you.
/me 6pokes Nick nonviolently again.
Hi, Dari.
Good to see you again.
You too. (:
What you been up to?
Mainly revision - lots of exams.
Fun fun fun.
Hahaha, I think I said exactly that at some point.
What happened about the idea of a brony IRC chat anyway?
/me lifts head up, "Am I the only floofburd here atm? :O "
*non-shadow
6D:
/me blinks at you
/me 6sulks.
...you remind me of someone very familar...
I just dunno who =/
We pretty much just been waiting for you to see if you'd be up to watchign the chat when the rest of us are gone.
6Ovo
tis a RP reference, :P
Otherwise we have a huge gap where we have no mods here to run the place.
you get a cookie if you remember it
6I think.
Well sure, I can keep an eye on it, but I still think that IRC doesn't usually require much moderation - I've seen botnets come and go with no ops around. :P
requires*
6Those KH stuffs? :P
ding ding!
*tosses
Especially when you have spam filters and such in place.
8btw silver, i sent an email to Sethisto about ponies getting removed from Facebook
/me 6noms jubilantly.
(late) *curls in terror at the poking
6ovo
/me 6offers a crumble of cookie to Nick.
Are you afraid of regular floofburds, Nick?
no
just shadow lugias
oh, I am a regular floofer ^o^
Nice.
6Facebook has been flagging a lot of things, apparently.
...who's Pallaskitten
it's me I think
?*
hello.
8lol
hello
8hes been lurking here a la dari
6My friend just tried to link me to a Smashmouth video and it was flagged.
I see.
i'm new to ponychan, just lurk for two days or so
cool. will you be here for the event?
6Ah, fish, lag.
feesh? :O
I guess so
6.hsiF
Cool.

Ha.
:3
Obligatory, lol.
8wow, sethisto already responded
What'd he say? o.o
8he said ponies on his facebook haven't been taken down
8so im pretty sure it was just a specific pony hater flagging them
12!espeon
/me now belongs to Umbreon for 11 minutes
Probably.
/me 6again pokes Nick.
/me noms Angel's floof
My profile pic is my Silverscreen OC, and it's still up too.
/me flees again!
Haha, I don't do facebook anyway, I tell my friends if they want to get hold of me they can phone me. :P
12-o
/me attacks Nick
That's probably home phone too - my mobile is never on.
/me 6recommends that there is a simple, pseudo-deus-ex-machina solution to this.
8i have facebook up all the time
8never post ponies on it though
I use my phone most often.
I've sent something like 10 texts in my lifetime. XD
8lol
8i send that many texts in half an hour
6I text like, two people, because I don't like texting.
My friends have gotten used to it.
6The responses are never fast enough.
8i communicate primarily through texting and facebook
6Should I just say it? :P
8i never call people unless i abslutely have to
I see my friends every day at school anyway, and I don't know why, I just don't like facebook.
6Anybody here have any idea why my wifi would be blocking images registered to a site, but not the site itself?
8lol i dunno
Sounds like what might happen if you're behind a proxy.
Sometimes images get blocked.
8facebook is necessary for college
6It's a cafe wifi.
8its how i keep in touch with my friends form back home
8from*
/me is typing up his one RP character's backstory, and just now realized how much he's RP'd in /oat/ XD
Yeah, I'm going to have to get it to keep in touch with the people leaving my school. >___>
6Reference? Ovo
/me 6made one? ovO
Issa nother.
misters
we all mods here?
Mods and lurkers.
:P
yeah.
8pallaskitten isnt
are also official ponychan mods here?
6Nope, pallas.
Nope.
8nah, to my knowledge none of us are ponychan mods
nope
okay
6To your knowledge.
pallas
yeah, to that KH FF?
I made someone think I was for 5 seconds. :P
can you please come back in an hour?
/me is no Ponychan mod.
we gotta fix something
6Didn't even realize. XD
/me can't remember the name
it was weird but awesome though
XD
What we gotta fix?
6Haha Hipster, my wifi blocked your image.
8okay.jpg
I remember Vexen and them were in the school
XDDD
the kids were just doggin' on Vexen
8it was bert looking up from a book dramatically
it was great XD
6Oh, TLS?
6XD
yes!
6Not sure why that's blocked...
it's confidential, for now
6Indeed.
6Um, mod chat?
6Still an awesome fic. :D
6Probably, Silver.
6It has a sporking community dedicated to it. Ovo
I need the stream window for it
it's something related to video feed
6Ah.
8 1 sec
oh, then I'll get into the site real quick.
XD
8ok
8all mods now
okay
we're getting our first "hijack" tomorrow
6Eh, should I make some realized references to it?
8okie dokie loki
it's Astray's birthday, so I want him to run our movie-choosing ballot
if ya want
8what do you mean?
Hijack?
he's an experienced streamer and setting things up now. All it takes now is a bit of practice and testing
6Well...
well, for a few weeks
we've been planning (Hipster had heard of this)
a "BronyState Intermission" show
6First of all, where are you, Nick? AFK?
8brb, ill be back in like 10 minutes
11Oh yeah.
11The invasion thing.
Nope, still not with you.
11Like with our Spiderman Stream derails.
Im here
hiding
11Only it'll be completely taken over by somepony else.
6I get what you're saying... I think.
I'll need you to add another name to the exception list
of the script
well
rather
2
6Okay, Nick, well, solution:
You can do that, there's a command for it. :P
"Redfield" and "Astray"
6Catch me. :P
Well Redfield was already in the list anyway.
which is?
6!addmod
!addmod Redfield
XD
O.O
!addmod Astray
/me zips lips
!addAstray
04o.o?
/me gets the heck outta Dodge
!add Astray
I dun wanna be caught!
I have no idea
It worked.
:P
6lol
It sent you a message.
[22:56] -> *NewDCD* Redfield has been added to the mod list.
-
[22:56] -> *NewDCD* Astray has been added to the mod list.
6If you don't allow yourself, you don't. :P
6Okay, so, we know what we're doing with this, I hope?
/me 6noms on fishy crackers while she waits.
:O
feesh
6I do have to go in two minutes, Nick, so make it quick!
feeeeeesssshhh
feessshy crackers! :D
/me 6gives Aero a bet(t)a.
/me blinks
I didn't get it
that said
I'm just waiting for Astray to finish fixing up
11As far as I know, we've got everything covered. Just need to spread the word from one mod to another. We've changed the game of movie selection, due to TurniBrony's proclaim of deception.
not that much, really
only that it's live
11Instead of raffling on the next saturday, we're gonna try doing it another way. In the middle of the stream, we'll quiet the room, and call the names of the winners few. We then use the command to give them the voice, so that they can announce their movie of choice.
8im back yo
11Word.
6bingbuster
Yo!
6Would you mind coming back in about an hour? We have some things we need to take care of.
7np!
brbs
11Yo binguster, your name is ironic, 'cause I started bringing out my rhyming tonic. But if you don't mind, you gotta leave, we've got some mod duties we need to weave.
8oh, btw DCD, before i forget
8Sethisto is going to post us on EQD both today and tomorrow
8and I may need to leave early tomorrow night (have to be up at 6 am saturday morning
8)
8and i am going to mist most of movie night next week because im running a football camp between 5:30-10
8miss*
11Hipster, dog, no need to sweat, we mods can handle one night short, on that you can bet.
8good one
6AppulJok
uhhhh
i forgot that today is thursday
6XD
im a silly pony
Hahaha.
6It's cool.
Ah well, some people arrive 2 days AFTER the event.
6We just have some mod things to take care of, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave for a bit.
ok
11You silly pony, did you lose your way? The movie night isn't for another day.
full presidential scholarship
Are we still waiting for any mods?
6Ghosties should be back soon.
And after that?
6I'm surpised Peanut isn't here, since he's on ponychan.
8bristle was here earlier
6Look, an anon.
11From the top of my head, I do believe, we are missing mods, the number being three. Good old ghosties suddenly left, and we need brony and peanut to get in here yet.
Look, more.
6Look, another anon.
11bristle*
8EQD post
8we're gonna get some curious people dropping by
6Worst. Time. Possible.
Channel called "TVEpisodeCentral" I wonder if they've got MLP on their list. :P
6Anons left, new anon already.
11You fellow mods, I got an idea. Let's flee to the mod room that we hold dear. The last thing we need while we are talking is more anon's doing some silent stalking.
6We'll still need the stream private though.
8yeah, thats the main issue
8im in there already too
02Wb~
We don't know if people are watching the stream though.
Just because they're not in here doesn't mean they aren't.
however, if they're not here
they have no way of knowing it's live
that said
we still gotta keep anons out
7Back.
11If you don't mind, I want to discuss: What are we showing that's got to be hush hush?
/me 7pokes Nick.
8hijack
hijack practice
8its supposed to be a surprise
btw Hipster, I think you should hand the user list to the other streamer instead, but yeah
8what do you mean, DCD?
11Now I understand why you want the chat room for mods only, So I'll get my kick boots ready for those anon bronies.
X.O
6lulz
Lol, not explanation.
no*
6Give a reason.
11Reaction. <.<
8yeah, make sure you explain
11asdf
Why do we not have a proper locked room? :P
miss Trollestia
7Well?
we're in the middle of mainteinance
would you please come back in an hour?
dont really need it so far
6lol copypaste
11A good default message.
7I'll even re-summon S_L for you. :3
6Need to fix my mispelling
11No I don't. :P
NOOOOOOOOOOO D:
/me flees again
/me 7gives Nick a Master Ball.
...O_o
Should just set up autokick with that message, haha.
11THEY JUST KEEP COMING CAPTAIN!
8... is that a thing dari?
11I'm having too much fun with it.
Sure.
Or you could just ban all and put up expections for mods.
7Hopefully, this doesn't cause me to disconnect:
11Didn't we do that by accident?
In fact, why not do that? O_o
7INCOMING.
11A few weeks ago?
6ban all would make it so people would freak out though
8whatever we can do to keep people out
I suppose, yeah.
11I like what we're doing now.
11:D
Meh.
6dari, can you set up an auto-kick script for non-mods?
Yeah, but if they don't come in with their mod nick they're going to get kicked.
11That would be my problem.
/me 6provokes Nick. ovo
6They can join another channel and change nick there.
11Since the chat will randomly reset on me.
I could set it up to recognise mod hostnames, but I haven't bothered to record all of yours.
That, and we plan on changing it after every movie to keep non-mods from discovering it.
Non-mods can discover it in 2 seconds. :P
....damn. I forgot about that.
This place is lively.
hmm?
...still, I like changing the name. :D
8dari, it's the people here, Ghosties, Bronypeanut and MisterBristle
sO
Wasn't talking about nicks, was talking about hostnames.
How come
we have
so damn many
strange, one of my best buds is named Dari, but i know for a fact that hes at chipotle right now
XD
visitors on a non-movie day?
8DCD, the post on EQD went up

11<.< lucky
8?
11You haven't heard of Rarity Sauce's Ferris wheel?
6If you don't know, you don't want to.
8i missed the origin and the mods have a code of silence about it
13Wait
13I'm lucky?
13Hahahah
8ive heard of it, but i missed the original thing about it
13Oh man.
13That's funny.
6I am the ferris wheel, silly filly.
13I have the thread screencaps of
13My "first time"
I've never really understood the appeal of RP.
11Hipster: Apparently Rarity Sauce as a dominatrix side to her that got unleashed while riding a Ferris Wheel with Lucky Streak.
8me either, dari
I tried it once - I just felt stupid. XD
8ah
13Well
Unless the Sonic Rainboom IS Rainbow Road. All the ponies drive on it as Rainbow Dash makes it.
13What we do.. Isn't really RP.
13well.
13Serious RP.
8THATS WHAT SHE SAID
11It's a special taste that not all have.

better, but still skippan a lot
ironically
the quality improved
of the video, I mean
Astray is streaming, or he's not streaming o.O
yeah. and it came out of an accident that cost him some money.
I am confuse
SHOW ME THE WAY TO YOU
the idea spawned from the accident i mean
LEAD ME NOW WHERE YOU ARE
6Argh, no broadcast. I may need to restart comp.
4Skippin quite a bit
but yeah pretty bad skippan
6One moment.
'In every crisis, there is an opportunity.'
8he's streaming for the hijack for sure
werr werr werr

400 as video bitrate
it might work
that said the actual image quality is pretty damn good
most likely my faggot router

4Still skip
REALLY bad lag
8still really laggy
or still laggan?
I see
then
oh okay lag's mostly gone now
no wait there it is
4Man
it must be because it's an MKV
most likely there's faggotry in the decodan
4What's causing the lag and skip?
11Major lag now.
6So much lag.
I use mkvs too and barely get any problems
;o
lag's gone now
Ray... I feel your pain.
11It's fine now.
6And now none.
for now I mean
I see
Now go play video games. xD
13It's working great.
02xD
13For me
6It's only during the big fancy animations.
8its so hard to tell with anime
13At least.
then lemme try something
8looks non laggy tho
02Valkyrie Profile or Monster Hunter...
great video quality as well
is the lag back now?
6Nope.
8cant tell
02hard choice D:
wait for it
8dont think so
wait for it
4@Sprinkles: That's still annoying, though
nop-just a split second, but it was rREALLY minor
6Turn volume up please.

8i wish i had the audio thing, cuz im pretty sure i could kill this stream
4Who's a horrible person?
oops, lotsa lag in that one spot
6Was talking to Astray.
6For killing the sound.
11What the fuck? My shockwave flash plugin suddenly stopped working.

4What the hell is going on?
like 30 seconds maybe
it's pausec
*paused
I'd say
the quality is pretty amazing
guys, when I stream
does it ever look that good?
4Yes
Wat dis?
suddenly GUN X SWORD
4Yeah
no lag brah
oh wait there we go
LAG!
8tons of lag
I hope we get this lag problem fixed by next week
letsu try that agen
no lag.
tell me if there's any lag in the same spot
or around it
i am 12 and what is this
8getting some lag now
better, but still
4Almost in the same pot
4*spot
It's cropping up here and there.
At the same spots.
Astray I wonder
04What
might it be your connection
04How and why
You mean by tomorrow?
unlikely bro
or your Mac?
not sure
4But Astray isn't streaming the whole event
lemme try on windows
4Tomorrow
4I mean
yeah, I was gonna recommend just that
that said
4DCD says he's streaming next Friday, though
8astray is streaming the whole thing next week
that said, DATASS
03http://www.facebook.com/notes/neweggcom/best-buy-cease-desist/10150330344693572
do you have screen capture software for windows?
:3c
03because they're retarded
cause I could give you what I got
03@ Best Buy, not Newegg
4That's what I'm talking about
Well...shit...we better get it working then.
4I seriously hope so
04YES
sure bro
04THE HELTH BAR
get me on msn
04IT WORKS :DDDDDDDDDD
03um
03OK?
04kinda
04and um you don
04't get it
8sometimes i wish i knew shit about computers
4I do as well'
04I was doing actionscript and I made the health bar stop animating when I told it to
04which is awesome
4But even if I did, I couldn't stream since my upload speed is shit according to DCD
8my upload speed is ridiculous
8so if i had the audio thing, i could probably do a pretty badass stream
8but im not gonna be here next week anyway, so...

8yeah
4Do they allow that on MSN?
8i dunno what the problem was
o.o what the fuck did I just open the stream to?
6MSN isn't very well regulated.
6lol Silver
8maybe ill give it a shot again at some point in the future
4@Silverscreen: Astray's dick
4Right
8thank god i had a different tab open then
4It's gone now, Hip
wait, I'm on?
whoah
I see tabs.
suddenly censorship
The stream died on me.
for some reason the program wasn't open
but it was running
btw that was me, not Astray
4Dude
4Okay, so, is the current stream DCD or Astray?
how's that?
Astray
btw bro, no lag, but it's on a bad position
oh no wait, there we go, rag
8halfway off the screen
8nm
Astray
that won't work while you're live
experience talking here
well, so far...yeah, a bit of lag
what aboot now?
still bad
4Why does my stream keep cutting off?
even worse, perhaps
I knew it
there, now there's no lag
okay, that was a bad spot of lag
4Massive lag, but can someone tell me why my stream keeps stopping?
8ghosties, he turns it off to adjust it
6Fancy scene = MASSIVE LAG
4Ohhhh, good. I thought it was me for a moment
4@Sprinkles=correct
let's try this again
6So far so good.
6AND THEN LAG
Astray
what's your UL speed?
usually?
high as fuck :3
according to speedtest, at least
well there's no lag atm and we're on a pretty fancy scene
4Is the stream running?

the show is tomorrow
4I'm not gonna enforce it
6The code enforces it.
0wtf?
4True
4Did you get a warning, DJ?
6Though we can turn it on/off.
0this chat sucks... EqD is 10X better...

people don't read the rules
6Nope, why would they?
and we didn't have a chance to explain WHY, either
4But he left of his own volition
4And said we sucked, so, his loss
To be fair to him though, we really do suck.
:P
4dari!
8okay.jpg
we suck so good
Hey.
4"we suck so good"
We are a "B" stream. XD
4>_>
...
I'm not going to get into that.
4We're the premier Brony stream
well, competition's popping out
11WHere?
sadly I won't be able to stream MST3K
sadface
4Probably because this one's been succeeding
well, the stream we were announced with
4Why, DCD?
because of the other stream
they specialize in MST3K
11What other stream?
11Ah.
4Man
4Bullshit
4*crosses arms*
11nah, let them go.
it's dishonorable to steal another person's thunder, so yeah
11MST3K isn't all that good for this kind of thing
11All the bashing is done for you.
Hipster, I'll try to get you a VAC
and you could become the third streamer
is there going to be anithing here?
it's due tomorrow
11We're doing maintenance today, Bronyman
read the post in EqD o:
we run on Fridays
4When does the MST stream run?
6 PM EST I recall
so it should be running right now
11On fridays?
understood
4So they run on Thursdays
Thursdays
4Alright
4Well that's cool
11Oh, then it's not much of competition if it's a different day.
11Hell, it just gives bronies more to look forward to throughout the week.
11Mysterious Science Ponies. SCIENCE!!!
4Exactly
4Hell, even I'd want to be involved in that because I'm a huge fan of MST :P
/me has no idea what MST3K is.
http://i.imgur.com/79U23.jpg
4*gasp*
4Bad chatroom!
:<
someone stole it from somewhere and everyone was flipping out at her
4I demand you go out on YouTube and look up an MST
oh wow
I see that a lot on dA
Okay. :(
8whats a vac?
11...did you just call him chatroom?
4I did
let's try this again
4But shhh...no one's supposed to know :P
4Massive skipping, Astray : /
...
srsly?
4Yeah
11Yes.

4It's a bit better
4But the lag is still bad
ok, now?
8still lag
8really bad lag
I see
the problem is with the encoding
y'know, i think another possibility could be
your graphics card
exactly bro
considering my computers are pretty old
4So...what do?
kill people
always cheers me up 8|
there's another possibility
I don't know how it works on Mac
but mayhaps, you could give FME more priority, like with the task manager in windows?
fucking shit :V
8im starting to get real worried about next week
I think that, if we have to, we should just skip next week's BMN.
4Are you serious?
I'd rather have no stream than a stream that's lagging most of the way through.
4We'd have to go over it with the others
Astray
here's an idea
how about you make your player smaller?
and zoom in?
it should be less taxing on your cards
/me pokes prince-
04erm
8i agree that i would rather have no stream than a shitty one
8a shitty one will turn people off and we will lose viewers
4But what do we tell all the bronies?
4"Sorry, no stream next week, catch ya later?"
4Unless, we find someone to stream it for us...
4Like, ask Ponychan
8there's a chance i may be able to get out of the football camp next week, so let's see if i can stream early next week, and if i can, i'll try and get out
8thats a bit of a crapshoot

8we might have to say, due to unforseen circumstances, we have to cancel this week's Brony Movie Night, and then just push back the movies we select to the following week

which were they again?
4Party of One, and Over a Barrel
4Do you have the films ready?
films are ready and were a bitch to get
already got Over A Barrel
4Man, that sucks
gotta get Party of One th-
no wait,
4about acquiring the films, I mean
I already got them
8cool beans
4Yeah, I figured you had the eps already
4We've already seen them in previous BMN
4s
since we have streamed them before
8so how is the thing with astray gonna work tomorrow?
thanks for the voice LocutusOfBorg! Burp! :p
/me rawrs~
8are we still doing it even though he has a laggy stream?
11This week I don't think matters much. It's NEXT week that concerns me.
probably
his hijack won't need to worry much bout lag
in any case
I'll get talking with Refield
*Red
8he's an option for streaming as well?
4If we can't figure out next week, we may have to cancel. At least, that's what's been spoken of
4Unless Redfield can help
4Or Hipster can get it working

8what exactly does that mean, practically
8?
it's a software alternative to Stereo Mix
This place has still calmed down considerably I see.
8this would be for me so i could stream, yes?
03calmed down?
yes
I mean it was the same way I left it
not very active and secluded with nobody new.
07funny that you can judge that from a minute of inactivity lol
03indeed
8well, i would have to see if i can get out of that football camp first
I see the chat list.
I see no new members.
and I see no active discussion
That is what I base my judgment upon.
03so not having new members immediately disqualifies the chat as being worthy of talking on?
03I question your judgment
As I have always questioned your bias judgment against others
07lol
07what a dork
03I know right

4So I had to reload the page and sign back in manually
6Well that's... rather annoying.
4Yeah
4That's iot
4*it
4I'm pissed
4I'm fucking pissed off
night all
That shirt is pretty awesome
You know what will make you feel better?
ponies
Though I suggested that she use a royal guard pony
6...why are you pissed?
hmmm
that wouldve been interesting
4Soldier
http://zorin.org/db/forbidden-lobby.jpg
4Fuck that pretentious self righteous prick
6What did he do?
pick up that can
Heh
6His thread got stickied?
That was inspired by an asshole security guard
I went with Tinker to her work building because she needed to pick up something at the office
While waiting for her I decided to take some photos.. and a guard got all pissy and told me I couldn't take photos. I finished taking that shot and asked him why and he was like "You have to leave now"

4A friend of mine explained that it's better to just ignore Soldier. And so I minimized his thread

Dude
you would hate Aero's sister
6IMHO, Soldier gives good advice, but outside of it he is quite pretentious. I honestly didn't even read any of the posts in that thread outside the first.
4It's better that I don't troll out of anger
lol yeah that was the first thing i said :P
4I don't even read what he says unless it's about a tenth of what he usually posts
6And even in his advice he can be a flank.
oh dear.
he put the guy in the can >.>
14Lol you'd hate me
14Because cats literally grow off me
4What gets me is that he always posts the same picture too
/me is made of catfloof and more of it
4For every huge post like that
4Which is about 99% of his posts
6Yep.
6Annoys me quite a bit.
6If you're going to stick with a personality, at least change the damn picture.
The best part is he throws away the can too and then casually walks on
4I do agree
4*sigh* I think I'm just gonna have to swallow my tongue on this one
4I can't fight Soldier now, he's too loved by the community
x3
6I'm really quite neutral on him. His only redeeming quality is that his advice, while being usually quite rude, is usually good.
Aero's little sister says meow a lot
XD
4Here's how I see it
4Ponychan is an imageboard
4Most posts are quick and to the point
4They are short and usually, for the metaphor, sweet
4So you have this topic that's full of people talking to one another

4and then, suddenly
4GIGANTIC MEGA HUGE ULTRA POST
4And what happens?
4Everyone immediately starts talking about the post
4And, since this is Ponychan, people LOVE it, even if they don't read it
6Yeah, there are a few ponies that do that, and it is incredibly annoying.
4Soldier hogs attention to himself
4He is an attention horse
4He is the biggest fucking attention horse on the goddamn website
6He really is. And then he goes "You guys are spoiling me." In a sarcastic manner.
4He KNOWS that when he gets done typing his humongous post and he searches through that photos folder of his and clicks on that same fucking picture for all of his gargantuan posts he knows he is gonna get showers of attention from everybody

6I was honestly trying to get it autosaged, so I posted like, ten images, including caps of the post he had just made.
4Bravo sir
6It autosaged, but then got stickied. >>;
4Wait, so it's locked?
6Nope.
6It got stickied so it would still be findable.

6The difference between quirks and problems, is what I'm saying prevents people from being interesting or not.
6Problems usually having to be extremely bad, really.

6I dunno what I'm saying.

6At first it was interesting, then you realize it's a CONSTANT thing... which is annoying.

they were first introduced in sonic adventure for dreamcast

6I did. XD Just so I can try to autosage his threads.

12well try to force it down
4It wasn't just you though, someone actually created a soldier folder just so they could use it as a guideline for lessons or some shit
6I KNOW.
12!blame Isukra thinking of playing halo or cod
but then Ill get sick ;-;
6But I expected as much, otherwise my keeping of the images would be pointless.
12it's just one burger

Ill kill it, tho

ew
12you made me depressed for not eating burger D:
4Well, I've got something written out in the reply box and I'm really thinking about whether or not to post it
12and when we are depressed we do self-destructive things
12like play bad video games
6Best not to start a mudfest over it.
so you take it out on imaginary pplz D:
6It'll wear down with a little time.
12XDDD
12a different angle
12but sure still valid

12i know D:

food isnt meant to be wasted
12exactly
12you didn't eat it and wasted it D:
4I'm gonna say something to him some day. I already spat out a little something this afternoon but I don't think anyone paid attention to it
nu
it ould have been wasted on me
*w
12...
6I'll probably say something at some point if it keeps up, likely relating him to Hal.
4Oh god
4That fucker
6Hal is just... ugh.
4You know he just started posting reaction images of himself, right?
6Yep.
4What a douchebag
6I need to find one of his images, and shop it onto the image of Trixie making out with herself in a mirror.
4If you do it, I'd save it
o.o
4That'd be awesome brw

6First, I need to get shop.

4I'm not even tired, which is strange

I haz question
04sure
/me laas
Okay
So this mod I possess (PAX Redoran) has many quests which have many paths
this quest in particular involves Molag Mar, and a Arena being built
BUT the man building it is using slaves as gladiators against younger Redoran members
So I'm kinda torn between the decisions
04...The decisions of?
Allow the Arena to be built
or Suspend it
6I've been drinking this Cran-Energy stuff, so I'm wired.
04Well
6Have enough to last me a good while longer too.
04Give me the arguments
04Why should the arena be built in the first place?
So, the guy whom is building is doing it because he wants the youth of Redoran to have better experiences with fighting
to know how to fight, how to survive in harsh conditions
and against creatures that will kill you no matter what
He is saying that people crave people
and the Great House of Redoran creates fighters for this peace
04There is a thing called sparring
He, basically, wants to train the youth of Redoran in a warrior-type fashion
04WHY DOES NO ONE REALISE THAT
04Anyway
4Well, too bad I can't just stay up as long as I want. My brother and his family are visiting and they're leaving to go spend the day out of town in the early morning. So if I want sleep, I better do it soon
04What would you rather do?
04Are you affilated with House Redoran?
I'm its fucking ArchMaster
aka like the Tevlanni Archmagister
04kthen
04Screw the slaves then
04BUILD IT
Whatabouttheargumentsgainstit?
04Slaves
04you don't want the slaves to die
04I get it
And, it's Honorable
But I do see the practical usage
so yeah, I'm literally torn
6That's rather unfortunate.

Pros; the youth of redoran get more training in combat and they get "entertainment" in Roman style
Besides, get Morrowind for PC also BU
So you can get "Rise of House Telvanni"
4Yes it is
or visit Telvanni lands on the mainland
04oh
04so there's more behind it than "Trainging Redoran:
04Yeahs.
04Go with the suspend option.
6Honestly, I'd get sleep, if it wasn't for the fact that I know I wouldn't get up until like, 2 PM.
Well it is an Arena
4Well, yes, there is that I suppose.
what do you think those NPCs at the Arena in Oblivion were?
Hell you actually fought three slaves from Argonia in there
4If I didn't have family visiting, I wouldn't be worried at all about sleep
04I never had Oblivion
Which I still see as totally unfair on both sides
oh
yeah
you can either join the Arena in Oblivion
or you can bet on the Blue Team
or the Yellow team
and get a double of your bettings if you win
most of the people whom you see in the stands are assholes
04o-o
6Must... move... higher... on... GETters... list... *twitch*
betting because they will gain Septims
04i.e. drakes i.e. gold i.e. money
don't really care if the gladiators die, unless their on the team they're betting on
Yeah
I go with septims
04I just go gold.
But yeah, it's akward in Morrowind for there's a slave market in Molag Mar
sorta like in Sadrith Mora
except you can't buy em
4GET threads are alright, I suppose
04I bought a slave once.
4I don't have anything against them
04I was gonna give him armor to help me in combat until I realised they're useless
04So I set him free
4I've never even witnessed one : /
04I'm a good samaritan like that
Your Telvanni
That's like me saying the Cammona tong are all fluffy and cuddly
but yeah
they are
they offer no benefits besides..
being like the Annoying Fan
or in this case the "Adoring Fan"
he alerts you when enemies come. By running away like a coward
04XD
04I saw this video where someone shot him off of a cliff with a bow.
04It was hilarious
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypXMAIL0p5w Here's accuracy
that even makes Dagoth Ur and Vivec Cringe
,,actually
have you ever noticed Fargoth

it's better than the Oblivion oen
4 7
6I don't have quints yet, so if I get them, that'll bump me up five points and put me on top.
4that's a lot
4septuplets i mean
6Yeah, only two ever on /oat/
4DEM SEPTUPLETS
4Didn't Celestia get it before?
6The one !!Celestia got, and the one Circuitfry got after !!Celestia moved the server forward so as not to be mean.
/me hits the ground
4Ah
4I remember hearing that people were pissed when Celestia got septuplets
Drake; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UYYx1xX74E&feature=related
6Pretty much.
This video...put armor on slaves
6That's why Celestia jumped the server so far ahead on post count.
6To give everypony a second chance.
6I was doing something IRL when they came around though...
6Have to wait another 100 days.
4Boo
6Meh. Nopony has Sextuplets yet, and yet they happen every 10-11 days.
6In fact one was today.
12o-o

4Circuitfry got 'em, yes?
6Today, nobody GOT them.
6Somepony got them by accident.

/me stares at Drake
you better make it
I had careers day today
04You already decided?
went to 3 IT lectures
04You've got two years
they were fucking awesome
or at least the first two
but I need an ATAR of motherfucking 91
to get in
;x
I also like how 75% is considered "average"
because that's fairly easy to do
you had 187
04o-o
uh
138
04Wild Drake fled!
04Anyway
04I dunno what my ATAR would be
12ATAR?
91 is a pretty damn high score
and one of the people came to speak to us today got an ATAR of 99.9 back in 2002 @ Drake ;x
04wat
she was an ex-student of my school
04Is that even possible?
and apparently during that year
1/3 people got an ATAR of 99 or higher
I was like holy SHIT
04...
04shit
;_;
04I suddenly feel really pathetic.
Yeah
and yeah, 99.9 is possible
the highest is 99.95
but basically
if I want to get into the UNSW for an IT course
I need an ATAR of at least 91
and 97.85 for psychology

04You're not particularly paranoid, at least from this perspective.
you don't know me
to that extent
hell
when I walk to school
04Thus I said, 'from this perspective'
I'm paranoid that someone is going to jump out from behind the rubbish bin ahead
and then a week ago, I refused to eat the pizza that my SNL had bought after it was left on the table for an hour or so
04o-o
because I was trying to decide whether it was poisoned/contaminated or not
04Oh
04I see
04I'm not so much paranoid as easily scared
