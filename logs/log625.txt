Wears no pants
Really, Meanwhile, you could just take mine. It would be less painful.
The most handsome of ponies

CHANGLINGS DAMN IT
/me bops LunaTheBeloved with her own leg.
Gotta love Rarity :$
I REFERENCED this song in the Ghost Stories episode!!!!!!!!!!!
Spademagnes[R]: I would say she's more corrupted by the power of fame than being a b****.
not sure if criminal scum
insinuat*
The animation gets weird at this point
ow
take this!
canterlot, where almost everyone wears a big hat
/me kicks Meanwhile with his own leg

This lie was never proven wrong

You're digging a hole rarity
Rainbow Dash is still famous
And her lyes never bite her in the flank
HoodyNinja: IKR?
/me bangs LunaTheBeloved's knee on the floor.
but she gets no screen time dammit

I SAY F you snooty people !
TheKatPony: who?
WHY WOULD ONE PONY MATTER
i really dont like that girls voice.
Spademagnes[R]: Rarity
God damn it rarity...
WOUNDAHFUULL
We need a Rarity and Luna episode! Have ALL the Tabitha! :D
you can't spell Charity without rarity
TheKatPony: I think that's the point of the voice.
08,01SOOONG!
SOOOOOOONG
YES
Well no duh
One of the MANY reasons Rarity is my least favorite character
<3
RaveBrony: Rarity/Octavia duet
Great one as well
Cello Scoots
monorail
Although she has good songs.
ooo rarity song
Aaaand song.
I REFERENCED THIS SONG <---------------------------
Song time Kiddies!
Rarity really lets her "fame" get to her head
HoodyNinja: O_O This Needs to happen! :D
Highlighting everything that's wrong with Rarity in 22 minutes
lowfn: But at least she learns from her mistakes, though.
Oh god forbid a character have faults.
I missed it
Photo Finish my love <3
RaveBrony: It was hinted it would
Rarity ;) <3 <3 <3 <3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: a
a?
Spademagnes[R]: So does Rainbow Dash.
Hey guys
AJIsAwesome: Only Twi's mistakes are good mistakes.
literal version is best version
Inb4 RAWRity Hands out asswoopings
CrimsonPhoenix: Hello!
Mare do well is why I hate Rainbow Dash
HoodyNinja: No wai o.o
that the asswoopings be handed out.
I love everypony
stfu
AJIsAwesome: meanwhile, RD's biggest lesson that's stuck is that she has the ability to read.
Also: OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
never seen a Reikim ?
11,01Came back during the song.
What the hell are those goggles on a stick supposed to be for?
I see Derpy!
/me breaks several of Meanwhile's toes
Dat Blueblood
DERPY
I mean in the title
o_O
lowfn: Technically, there's no definite meaning of "good mistakes".
"a" is a hit on EQD has his own fic and stuff
She comes home drunk.
"Random Merch: a"
Derpy?
o_o
Spademagnes[R]: opera binoculars
MOTHER OF OW.
...So I guess she cleared things up with Blueblood?
damn, i missed her
Omg Opal cared for 2 seconds
I guess, lol.
Oh hey Opal knows what she hsould be doing\
O hai Blueblood, bai blueblood
I hate Applejack because of Applebuck season
mind=blown
a.
/me snaps LunaTheBeloved's leg over his knee.
Bullshit.
LadyCanary: Or she blackmailed him....:D
I guess opal isnt THAT big of a bitch
CrimsonPhoenix: ...what
..............
Yeah, I see Derpy, I think um...third collum...third row?
AJIsAwesome: I make good mistakes alot in real life.
I hate Twilight because of About time
rawr i missed half of this awesome episode :(
Children.....cover your ears....
I don't know...
God damn it rarity
CrimsonPhoenix: You seem to hate almost everypony
just use fucking youtube
Stop ignoring your friends
I hate CrimsonPhoenix because he hates ponies
I don't hate any of the ponies, IMO. At least they learn from their mistakes.
I hate Pinkie Pie because of friend in deed
Reikim is an error that they make quite often and it evolved in the "a" meme on EQD at least
jet set sounds like a cool pony name
Pshhh, friends will understand :D
HoodyNinja: Wheres the love and tolerance?
Friends birthday
just to say character centric episode SHOWS their fault
I'm ore trying to figure out what the fuck would make somebody hate Twilight in It's About Time
I hate everything :s
/me lets out a blood chilling shriek of pure pain and agony as she falls onto the floor
nopony is perfect
that happens quite often in the fic updates
damn it, Rarity, does the title of this show of no meaning anymore...
LunaTheBeloved: We haven't had children on here in...ever.
Really rarity...
REALLY
Plus, the fact that they give in negative issues makes them emotionally stronger.
AJIsAwesome: Rarity doesn't; she just turns around and does it the very next time she gets the spotlight
ScootaChicken is still jailbait
lowfn: I'm made of cheese!
RRRGH
*give in to*
/me CrimsonPhoenix hates (insert pony name) because of (insert episode name)
^^
Reikim hi
Athgaar: again, what?
Opal gives zero fucks
Oh yeah
/me walks slowly to HoodyNinja and nibbles on him
le gasp
We do have children.
Have you guys listen to a word I said?
Opal doesn't give a shit.
My crotch is tastey
That's disgusting, Opal.:S
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
in trruth I love everypony but I love Rarity more
BREAK MY 4TH WALL, PINKIE
SMOOTH MOVE RARITY
but nopony as a least rank
thats the common cat reaction to everything
Balloons are the greatest travel accessories
...
To be honest, you can't hate any of the ponies, just the mistakes they make.
How do you store balloons in a case?
That balloons attack failed
PREPARE for incoming meme
/me stands up slowly as she pulls out a bonesaw
Spademagnes[R]: She's Pinkie PIe.
SEEMS LEGIT
Not in front of the children, guys!
Poor Opal.
i love this episode
no no no'
/me slowly begins chaining through Meanwhile's leg
ORANGE BUTTERFLY SCIMITARS
Spademagnes[R]: It's Pinkie. She found a way
uh oh
not poor Opal
she's a bitch
xD
also, gonna have to wait for TF2
she's a non-sapient cat
it's so simple
otakon|TF2: Ill play with you buddy
Spademagnes[R]: She's Pinkie Pie.......questions invalid
also, I LOVE how Pinkie hops EVERYWHERE
so pratical
so ME
opal has mascara
Right lets go with that!
D'AAAAAAAAAW TWI <3
okay back off to TF2
Oh Twi, you are the best.
that dress looks ugly to me tbh..
To be fair, Opal and Rarity seem to have a vitriolic best buds kind of thing going on.
Have fun, otakon|TF2
Unrelated: I can't write, therefore I shall game. I have a choice right now between Half Life 2 and Mass Effect. What do?
that dress if awful.
Seems legit
*is
/me 's moustache stretches out then springs back as he unleashes a shriek akin to blended gravel.
twilight_sprinkles: nobody ever said Twilight had the best tastes.
venezuelan poodle moths
wich mass effect ?
Plus, Lauren Faust wanted to make them give in to negative things sometimes so that they learn from it and it makes them AND their character more in-depth.
TheKatPony: Who's?
First one.
Spademagnes[R]: in Heavy Metal, there's a car in space.......QUESTIONS INVALID
YAATATATATATTA
PARTY CANNON!!!!!!!!!
those things are on your team :)
both are good
WOOOOO
Can you blame twilight for having bad taste when she reads all day?
HoodyNinja: Twilight's >.>
inb4 Twi's adorkable dance
Listen to AJIsAwesome guys
I'd go Half Life, but thats just me
TheKatPony: I like it ._.
Either way, I'm starting a new game.
do you know about the team game?
Rarity had a lot of good points
Spademagnes[R]: Bad taste? That dress is amazing! >_> <_<

Gonna take Luna's advice.
THe fact that they give into negative problems make them grow from them and helps them in the future.

AJIsAwesome: but nobdoy wants FAULTS with their characters! They just want every episode to have a Sonic Rainboom and to start Luna/Trixie/InsertBackgroundPonyHere

AJIsAwesome: I mean, c'mon. That whol exploring characters' shortcomings and having them grow from it thing is soooooo Season 2. Season 3 should be nothing but Luna and Vinyl Scratch calling Scootaloo a chicken for 13 episodes.

Why be TARDIS in that? I like it.
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh.....just like the Spongebob episodes
AJIsAwesome: because we're nerds
also Suited for Success implied the gala being soon
Spademagnes[R]: I find that most cutie marks are double entendre's, and have multiple meanings
Ah...good as new
AJIsAwesome: Because logic damn it
11,01All the RP :p
now imagine if any of those two are like that in bed :p
Great, now don't lose it again please.

This show couldn't have existed without Lauren Faust. She couldve never remade this show and this world would've have been worse than it is now. Why can't we just accept what is given to us instead of bitching about it all the time? Just saying.

lol
Spike seriously needs to learn how to whisper.:D
dat jelly
Just how old is Spike anyway?
AND SHE NEVER TALKS TO HIM ABOUT IT
Smart Fluttershy is smart.
The walls are a special paint, you can write and erase things on them
Spademagnes[R]: Like 5 or somethin
altho, Rarity never made Spike a tie...
Kencolt: yeah I think all of the mane characters have their own "moment of insnaity"
Everything rarity adds gems to becomes so freaking gaudy. Not as gaudy as that tree hat in hearts warming eve
and then reboot http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9f8c6NK941qhw0l2o1_500.jpg
twilight_sprinkles: she did
fluttershy is smartest pony
AJIsAwesome: he needs to take lessons from Fluttershy
Yea you just BLOW off the concept he MAY be jealous
FUCK YEAH REBOOT
twilight_sprinkles: gave ti to him for the Meteor Shower
Spademagnes[R]: It's like asking how old are any of the ponies are, it's not really important.
/me got it
WAIT
otakon|TF2: And now the one without a mane has one. All is complete.
/me chase the tumbleweed to the far horizon of the chat until it can't be seen
hey otakon|TF2, there's room on here now.
otakon|TF2: oh, ok, i was afk for that part and forgot
She said OMG
Yea dont help him or anything

RAWRity, when and where is that photo from?
"OMG" Did Twilight just reference God?
/me magiks the tumbleweed back
spike is jelly
/me flings a brick in TheGreatAndPowerfulT's general direction.
That looks like solid metal
Meanwhile: be in shortly
DAT JEALOUSLY
/me gives it a good kick
Rex_Mundi: O_O
How did it break?
and why is that captain in there?
*JEALOUSY*
my stream broke with the quill
BAD TOUCH!
spike needs an inside voice
OH MY GLOOB don be so jelly
CrimsonPhoenix: dunno. just found it in my tumblr dash
hahah
Best. Store. Ever
Spademagnes[R]: THe plot demanded it.
Can quills be made of metal?>
quail
I saw a comic based on this episode
Take a quill from the quail :D
should have taken a quail feather
Spademagnes[R]: even cooler are victorian glass quills
Bricks and tumbleweeds, bricks and tumbleweeds...
Where does Piniie get-- never mind.
CrimsonPhoenix: give me the link, please
queshes are good
We need some sort of tumbleweed emoticon. Or something.
RaveBrony: Actually, OMG = Oh my goodness
spike: that's scootaloo, silly
/me appears behind of Meanwhile and ducks making the brick hit Meanwhile
But only for in here
silly Pinkie pie
twilight_sprinkles: You are a rat creature?
>_>
Kencolt: She's Pinkie Pie.......questions invalid
Dark92Something, I don't really have it just remember seeing it
ZELDA SCOOTALOO
see that's why you don't use targeting bricks
I know Rarity is involve
why did spike just attack scootaloo?
So how does a metal quil break?
Unnr: haw?
Rex_Mundi: Yeah :D
CrimsonPhoenix: Oh OK
IT'S OVER 9000 <--------------
Spike is developing his power.
/me sits down and watches as the brick flies around
twilight_sprinkles: if you ever have the time, track down a comic named Bone
spike is still jelly
I assume I'm the only one who finds the fact Twilight never talks to spike about him possibly being jealous stupid?
/me 's moustache shatters the brick on impact.
Mhmm.
WE NEED A PLOT
Unnr: I love Bone. Too bad it doesn't get a lot of attention.
Unnr: well i probably wont have the time, but ill keep in my mind
Mister Mustache
HOW DIDIT GET BURNT
MOOD WHISLAP
owlicious did it!
gremlins
HOW DID IT GET BURNT
:D
who?
who
Spademagnes[R]: Its because twilight, as smart as she is, has her air-headish moments.
AJIsAwesome: The great cow race... enough said.
It was your own fault SPIKE
NOT WHO! TWO!
The bird had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
Spike, you are a dragon... Fry him :D
YAY LIGHTNING
Everyone gives in to their faults, it's just a natural thing in this world.
Crowning moment of SILLY coming in.
Two? Doctor TWO?!
love this part :D
Oh. Well I can stay for a little bit longer. I just had to switch computers :P
...Hmm...
Where did he get the mustache?
Spademagnes[R]: His pcoket.
Where?
spike is an idiot
Yes because that looks like a real mouse
<-------- One second to hiss the ''villain'', please.
I'd like to see an ep where Twilight accidentally makes everybody except her into G3.5 Ponies
Spademagnes[R]: He stole it from someone's mane.
/me is debating sculpting a hat, cape and moustache for their spike
Wait... where did he get the hat? And Cape? AND CATSUP? (He probably carrries the moustache around, so...)
AJIsAwesome: True, these are flaued characters, as eveyone really is. If everything was happy and perfect than this would be G3 ponies.
Dat music :D

LIES! EVERYTHING IS LIES!!!!!!!!!!!
moral of the story: next time kill an actual mouse
i meant excuse me

People say they are MLG when they really arent
Spademagnes[R]: So it doesn't mean anything?
Hai WindWhistler~
Stuck again. There's water involved. I hit the knobby thing to raise the water level, now what?
13will take it as far as i can stand
All in all just say "MLG" if you want to look like a huge douche.
Reikim one of the fun things is figuring out those puzzles

Okay, I looked up Google, and it's funny that the thing I said earlier that it really was a Red Ant...and I encounter a rat-sized one...

I already played Portal.
You're better than me in a game.. woop de fucking doo

13it's not
--- Shizuka is playing Tron 2.0 from 2003 ---
AJIsAwesome: ah
Anyone know how much laptop batteries cost?
uhhh $40?
is bad that i want to get lux just for the "i'm charging my lazer taunt/joke ?
13any ponies have I Hate Mountains for L4D1?
Think of it this way Shizuka: We're sharpening our ears.
Nope
I mean hearing
Yes.
She's actually a pretty good support.
And it's fun picking people off with the lazer.
10101010110
So are the orange guys computer programs?
support ? AP Nuke plz
PillowPoni: depends on the laptop it for i guess
Triforce?
holy shit
I hate that laser.
Well, she can do that too.
But Lux is really a better support on top or bot.
the disc made this game.
also want ezreal just for the hare hare yukai dance
Is that the Triforce?:O
NocturnalBlade its an Acer aspire 5517
Suddenly Rinzler
NullRadix: You still need to file your TPS reports
Lux is best as a support because of her shield.
and because i been playing a lot of champs with skill shoots
PillowPoni: ok, hold on and i'll look it up for ya
This doesnt require alot of gemotry does it?
NocturnalBlade: thanks.
Where did ti go?
0x43727573682c206b696c6c2c2064657374726f792c2073776167
I don't know. The little additions you have to put on yourself throughout the game made the game even more fun
I still cant get over the fact the triforce is on the disc
08,01NullRadix: let's jsut say that i'm surprised at myself for enjoying managing a convention more than managing a cloud computing cluster
aw yeah.
08,01i love telling people what to do, and fixing problems, and making people happy

Wer're watching TRON 1.5...
Just kidding, TRON 2.0.

Platforming in Tron?

13little did you know that computers are made out of minecraft
13of COURSE it's armor

Oh yess fps platforming...FUN

Yeah and you can easily die from like 10 feet Shiz
Activate moonjump.exe?
13eeyup
the memory management bit of this game was rather interesting at the time
I liked that part too Unnr
:) there I go
13i think god saves you from killzones but yeah
Meh its fine.
is ther a instant death tool in this game?
Disk is best weapon!
You throw like a ... uh... uh... I got nothin'

Slap!
So where is Megaman.exe?
I spent so much in this game just looking around
In the cool games folder
13think i should go the rest of the game just smacking with a disc? :3
Why is everything blue again?
But if you are talking about the DOS version
there are other weapons?
Yesh :)
Its on the useless shit folder
Shizuka: but then you loose amusing multi-disc shennanigans...
DOS version?
Unnr: lose*
I like the other weapons :)
What's a 'disc'? o.o
Yes theres a megaman DOS
better than my mom saying 'tape' for everything
Hopefully we'll run into Sora
ah, that DOS game, so.... underdeveloped

WAIT U R STREAMING TRON 2.0?
lol
When was the origonal tron made?
1985 i think
This reminds me of the last single player map in Unreal Tournament with Xan. Always nicking the invis belt.
It looked pretty good for its time
Tron 2.0 was like a fps if i remember
as this is a tron game, everything os color coded for your conveince
Oh good can we have some KFC then?
*is
Oh.. wrong guy
:D that "Daugh" sounds like Nigel Thornberry to me - I wonder if theres a mod with Nigel sound effects everytime you smack them with your frisby disc
1982 Tron Movie; 2010 Tron Legacy; 2003 Tron 2.0; 2006 Kingdom Hearts
What proof?
Get Norton or something!

Perhaps it's just moody.

So close to crashing there
YOU GOT BOOST POWER
^ WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT
More boost than Sonic Unleashed
sigh capslocks

I liked the map where everything is super speed. Nuts.
No Unleashed was really heavy on boosting
Back from am shower

How is SHizu not dead?

He crashed head on
wasn't the day stages pretty much dimps: the game?
Dken2021: Yep.
Dimps sure loves pits dont they
I actually kind of liked the Werehog based combat, but they obviously could've given it to Knuckles.
Can't you just tell me where to go?
You know whats really broken in Generations?
Hey Everypony! :)

Classic Sonic with the homing attack

DerpDash: Hello!
ello XAX
The in-browser chat.
I pop it out.
13DERP
I don't mind the Homing Attack for Classic Sonic...
Using classic homing attack breaks the levels
HERP Shizu
YOU GOT BOOST POWER
i know
was that a powerup or something that was at the beginning Spademagnes[R]?
/me knows Ponies47 is excited for freshman day :3

I like it but it defies the level design
show them 1st person!
DO IT
13yellow doesn't even try
13you can first person?
why not use mIRX or xchat ?
Dken2021: WHen you beat the game, you get it.
YES
Because lazy.
Dken2021: In the 360 version you get it for I think getting all the red rings for Classic
Dken2021: You have to get all the red rings, sorry.
its like... F8 or something. I can't remember
*NOPE
Theres this one power up in Generations that gives you infinite boost
uhmm k.
But it makes you a one hit wonder
I'm sure "Tron" is in the name... but what's this game called?
I bet it was made by dimps
tron 2.0
Tron 2.0
thanks
Spademagnes[R]: Have you seen this one guy competely destroy Modern Seaside Hill with that skill?
13creative huh :3
2.0, 2.0, 2.0
No

Tron 9.0.0.1.20
You know whats hilarious to do?
Apostrophe Key (') during lightcycles
Spademagnes[R]: He beat the stage in under a minute, I think.
Use the bubble sheild in classic sea side hill
Tron 9..0.2.1.0
13enough of those lame light cycles

Athgaar i almost forgot about its existance
13eeeyup

DerpDash it's not like you're coming out of the clost or anything, it's just a show after all, you do this with any other thing you're a fan of?
Then you won't understand him
Depends on how you think they will receive it. My cousin is cool with anything I do, so I told him. My brother already hates me with Phineas & Ferb. I don't dare tell him.

looks fun none the less
this game has some very simplistic textures
Petrified_Discord its pretty fun actuallu
Y
Dken2021: very red textures
its 2003. Yes its 1st person. It even has the lightcycle games.
This game sure fucking loves red
wait until the corruptions. All you see is green
Champion_of_Harmony: You think the first person sections are fun? Boy, you haven't seen the Lightcycle racing...
I have seen it.
Oh...
and they also look fun
Hm...wonder what'll happens if the world of TRON gets Error 404...
Lightcycle is best part in EVERY tron related stuff
Aka Blue Screen of Death.
Then everything turns BLUE
BLUEEEE
VenHur tron cant get 404
heh heh pong.
Its a game
What do you think this is, pong?
Not a webpage
Megabyyyyyyte!
13the implications of this game are pretty bad...
13faced with corruption, the system decides to wipe itself
13without user interaction
lol Kernel
Self aware.
Hi everypony
ohai OtakuTom
omg now THIS i can handle
OtakuTom: Hello!
If my memory doesnt fail me, the last level of this game is a escape mission
hiya OtakuTom
damn buffer
Welp
I was about to ask if that was a Tron game...lol
Awww
end?
Shizuka: So, you're telling us that if the game becomes a little more like Mass Effect-like user interaction, it can be...better?
where can you get it?
/me rolls around the chat
Ohai Engineer
not applejack version?
Practical problems.
Hello mr engie!
/me jumps over PillowPoni
NOT AJ
dem practical problems
this needs more Ponies
Has more gun. Needs more pony.

I say use all the gun.
What if...there's a version with BOTH the Engineer and Applejack?
Moar! Gun
/me pokes AJIsAwesome

Dken2021: He is? Can you post the link?

AJIsAwesome he still hasn't posted it yet, he announced it's done
13lul

13new intro is utterly terrifying when played at half speed
13the last pyro shot lingers so long :3
Shizuka next time you stream I wanna see taht
*that
please?
13i'll have to do that and my outro
I has some made up names for the Ruby and Sapphire remakes. "Pokemon MagmaRuby" and "Pokemon OceanSapphire" Versions...

13media player's slow speed is pretty awesome
13drags out like 200% more bass
They're not comfired, but it's likely possible.

/me hugs Canadian_Brony Dken2021 otakon NocturnalBlade Petrified_Discord Ponies47
I loved The first gen, Second was my favortie, the third was awsome, fourth was cool and the fifth, pretty epic.
/me was hugged
Good night!
/me is hugged
/me hugs back :D
/me Hugs AJIsAwesome back
AJIsAwesome: Big arms :P
Actually, I rather prefer "LavaRuby than "MagmaRuby" since the team in Pokemon Ruby is called "Team Magma"...
/me hugs everypony ^-^
and they never make a third for remakes discord.
Just thoughted of it,
/me was hugged again
/me hugs back... again
00,032nd Gen was best gen~
indeed it was
Eh
1st gen was best gen
I liked gen 3 ._.
Scoot-Scootaloo agreed
but I love all gens
i like all the gens!
Scoot-Scootaloo everypony has their own opinions.
Im just a fan of pokemon.
Digimon is best Pokemon gen
^ Say wuh?
lol
00,03My Ampharos wrecks people's shit!
Champion_of_Harmony: here here lol
Petrified_Discord: lol
I don't even know what that is Scoots
never really saw the point in remaking gen 3, but since gamefreak likes money, looks like it's inevitable
Canadian_Brony: Electric giraffe with flippers
Scoot-Scootaloo: I got a Shiny Ponya in Diamond Version.
Horry no one is arguing about the other gens!
I still find it funny people who say Pokemon designs now are lazy ignore Electrode
:I Motherfucking Flygon.
Canadian_Brony some kind of mutant sheep
My baby.
00,10Oh god, they are making a how to train your dragon show.
Mewtwo will always be Number one in my book.
Petrified_Discord Dken2021 they both sound like they came out of the Zoology lab of Doctor Insano
00,03Ponyta's are SOOO cool~
i remember the time i found a shiny flaffy but my power died like 10 seconds after i caught it
00,03Rapidash can go suck it though >: (
Canadian_Brony: http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ampharos.jpg
Sumica what is this, like the 5th show coming from dreamworks?
<.<
Sumica What. The. Buck. I didn't even like the movie much because it's nowhere close to the book.
I found a shiny Staru....and he had a very high defence.
A How to Train Your Dragon TV show? Does every Nick movie have to have a spin of show!!?!!?! :[
Petrified_Discord looks like a pokemom
Yes they do.
*pokemon
Sumica: I see you check CN's website, and yes it's true...First Penguins, then Kung Fu Panda, now THIS?!
*off
HEY!
I liked penguins....
wonder if hiccup is is gonne be still handicapped
Ponies47: Actually, that show is on Cartoon Network...
I still think Electrode is the laziest design ever
The others are on Nick.
either way, it's unnecessary
Spademagnes[R]: what about ditto?
VenHur: Cartoon Network? Let the shit fest of a TV show begin!
Suddenly Wii
:D A super MOO stream
11,02:D
oh look
dat wii menu
Wii
SuperBrony64 is streaming. Am I correct?
so ....old
Yes
yay
Electrode's the laziest design for a Pokemon? DUDE! IT'S AN UPSIDE-DOWN POKEBALL WITH EYES! ...Personally Voltorb's design is lazier...
Pokemon? Gamecube? some other game?
I like Gamecube
Yet people say the pokemon now are lazy
11,02Canadian_Brony: Indeed you are.
11,02I'll brb for a min, need to grab something.
Yea I know but its evo is still fucking lazy
VenHur: And then they made Foongus. Like..what the fuck?
Actually, Scolipede's an awesome Pokemon in design.
and ditto was a failed attempt at cloning mew.
Spademagnes[R]: yea they took just about every animal in real life and attached an object to it
yay!
Whoop!
Petrified_Discord: *checks Google and facepalms* Oh. my. gooood...
Yaaaaay, the boat is no longer useless.
VenHur: It evooooolves
what?
shibaru just left like half an hour ago
At least foongus looks creative
Spademagnes[R]: It looks like a fungus. :/
More origonal than a upside down pokeball...
?
00,03Ice Cream man was meh teir...
SuperBrony64 I should mention this now before I forget. You have your resolution set to widescreen, when clearly it should be full screen. Your circular icons aren't circles.
ohai game that is just a SNES game on a disc
00,03Snowflake man was "You have to be shittin me" teir
Ooh! Play a Gamecube game!
/me Gives Scoot-Scootaloo a tub of ice cream
yeah
11,02First time playing this game :)
:O
I'm playing Half-Life 2
Pokemon colosium!
Good luck, SB64!
or however you spell it
And I juse got the gun on the boat.
And the winner of Context-begone quote of the day is...
I have yet to see a pokemon lazier looking than Electrode
I don't know why, but I hate All Stars 25th Aniversary edition, I first, I thought it was going to be all the classic Mario games, now rendered in 2.5D NSMB Wii style.
eh?
OH! I've heard of this game.
yes
I have too
never heard of it
that was a bitchin game Champion_of_Harmony
But then I facepalmed, knowing it's the EXACT. SAME. GAMES.
oh dang, just missed them
it's supposed to be like a last hurrah for RPG's for the Wii
I remember when I found Vanillite for the first time. I knew I needed and ice type, but I just took one look at the sapient ice cream cone in front of me and said, "No." Then I buried it in the deepest, darkest depths of my PC.
Last story huh? are you gonna quit like with Xenogears?
So its a port of a port?
11,02Person who produced this game was the creator of the Final Fantasy series :)
i have never heard nor seen this game before...this could be interesting ^_^
supposed to be really good
Pokemon collsium? yes it was
Meanwhile?
random mii's here to ruin your entire day
So its been pretty active then?
No, you.
11,02The Last (Final) Story (Fantasy) :)
Oh well that makes sense then.
Champion_of_Harmony I dissaprove your misuse of the saying "eh?"
ooooh
yeah
SuperBrony64: "Dude, we promise, THIS is the FINAL one."
11,02:P
im on pretty much always, and shibarus on alot too
Petrified_Discord it never is
I didnt say eh however
The Last Story? If this was the last videogame to be released, hell, it fits with the title.

Our heroes, ladies and gentlemen. Hiding.
Why does ANYONE need a sword that huge?
Spademagnes[R]: to stab things
Oh hi Sephiroth wannabee.
that are a bit further away
to look badass
Spademagnes[R] if you can swing a big sword efficiently, swing away!
/me Facedesk
So much flipping
Spademagnes[R] you know what they say about guys with bigs swords right?
seriously to answer that question is for range and power
Dken2021: they're overcompensating?
longer range, more power in the swing
^
owloysius uhh, maybe... I forgot
so anything new mayo?
Well im living in a new house
and a chicken came into the classroom today
Spademagnes[R]: if u think thats a big sword google monster hunter 3

hey SuperBrony64, this game allows you to use it either with a Classic Controller or Wii Remote and Nunchuck, if I'm observing correctly. It wouldn't happen to allow use of a Gamecube controller too, would it?

Ah
Austin: depends
SuperBrony64: ded huh?
NocturnalBlade: on what??
SuperBrony64: I heard the camera has issues
What crazy game doesn't have a rotatable camera?
that's a hard question
Austin: on what SB wants to do lol
The camera is like the working class. You must be able to control it or else it will RISE UP AND DESTROY YOU! :[
besides this one
the game? lol
Resident Evil didn't have a rotatable camera...
00,02http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/27/disable_java_to_block_exploit/ << Important. go to about:addons in firefox and chrome://plugins in chrome
Canadian_Brony: The original mario
do you wanna know. once you start playing you can never stop
Nor did Eternal Darkness, Sanity's Requiem
11,02Austin: You're new here, what would you like to see? :)
The camera won't rotate? And I thought Super Mario 64's camera controls was a tad awful.
SuperBrony64: what you got?
SuperBrony64: and thanky ou for thinking of me :)
Austin: Welcome aboard the S.S Friendship, rookie!
don't give into his demands
11,02Well, you want me to play a certain game or watch a certain show? o.o
ban him for strongarming
Interesting Phase4
........... what games do you have?
11,02Austin: All of them :3
Buytoast, Oh you
i cant ask for somethign you dont have
hmmm....... can you play with friends right now?
11,02I don't have friends :<
Phase4 What is that about?
youve got us
00,02its a remote insta-own vulnarabity that works from a browser
11,02./)^3^(\
That's a lie and you know it, SB :P
00,02really need to disable java if you have it installed
Oh so you have house of the dead 2&3?
But SuperBrony64...what about us? We're your friends.
11,02Yes, I can play online games :)
Phase4: i'm confused
Phase4 oh dear

Plus, I have cookies.
i f in love that game!
11,02Austin: Aye :D
SuperBrony64: yay!
11,02BRAWL TIEM EVERYPONY

Hmmm...I'm surprised...I don't actually have Java on here...lol
story or matches?
AW YEAAAHH
Yay!
Brawl? Brawl?! *goes insane and rips shirt* BRAAAAAAAAWWWWLLL!!!
I don't have brawl . . .
you wanna know what else you need. My little Pony: FIghting is Magic when it comes out
Phase4 Umm how would i go about finding where to disable it?
I know I have Java on my computer for Minecraft...
i forget, do you need the nintendo wifi connector mabobber to go online with the wii?
I'm very confused wht up with java?
cause i've had to buy three of those already
But chrome://plugins doesn't use it.
and i don't wanna get a fourth
...Yeaah...I don't have Brawl either...
I have brawl but I just moved in and I'm not set up for internet yet. FUUUUUUCK me :P
00,02killerpony7733, about:addons in firefox, chrome://plugins on chrome
chat derped on me XD did i miss much?
SuperBrony64: not Rythm Heaven time?
We should all jsut got on minecraft!
Yay chatderp
T__T
00,02for other browsers you'll need to find the documentation
I don't have a Brawl, I don't have a Wii, or rather not having a great game...
TIL that apparently my windows box is still rocking Java 6.0.310.5
>_>
00,02Unnr, XD
Phase4 Do i find plug ins for chrome inbrowser or?
Phase4: shows how often I use it....
11,02Rhythm Heaven tiem after :3
SuperBrony64: I might be able to get my wii online. Lemme try...
SuperBrony64: yay!!!
alright, even though I don't use chrome, I disabled it anyway
SuperBrony64: why is your name normal now?
i don't know if Java is even running. I looked in my add-ons, but it isn't listed
is that good?
oh wait a sec...
is it on the ipod?
00,02killerpony7733, http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=142064
no
well theres an ipod app for it yes
00,02Canadian_Brony, can you go to the paintchat?
but you dont need an ipod to play it
idk, lemme check
Wait, there is a paintchat now?
00,02Canadian_Brony, if anything other than 'missing plugin' happens you have it installed
00,02Unnr, ...
00,02Unnr, its been in there for a while, its why i was raging about java in the other channel :P
Phase4: Oooooh, that makes much, much more sense
Phase4: are you a mod too?
Yea, I'm feeling better about it now...Chrome tells me I need to install the plugin...no chance I'm doing that right now...lol
00,02Austin, not really, i'm a tech
Phase4 okay, i have a purple screen. that means I have java installed?
Phase4: I thought it was a pet project...
Austin he can stream, tho
Phase4: still importnat
00,02Canadian_Brony, you have java installed
00,02Austin, true
/me doesn't interact with the BS site much, bookmark to spike + external client
then why the buck isn't it listed as an add-oN/
00,02Canadian_Brony, because its a plugin
^TL;DR So....... java is harming your computer? i'm going to uninstall java :(
00,02Canadian_Brony, yes there is a difference, rather important one
that's what I meant
it isn't listed there
00,02and now i must go
00,02bbl
Bye Phase4

thanks for the heads up Phase4
Austin: be back later

How have you been?
Austin better than your 6-yr-old sister walking in unannounced while you're watching MLP. Scared the living sh*t outta me
Austin: well if they make fun of you and what not then yea kinda bad
http://derpy.me/d9F0N
I don't have Java on running on Chrome and I'm getting the stream just fine. Stream should be Flash
NocturnalBlade: mines 11. still scary as shit
Canadian_Brony: :D

/me throws a muffin at Buytoast
SuperBrony64: .......... idk really
SuperBrony64: dont play my Wii anymore
I'm with you, Unnr. Brawl is great, but I just like Melee better. I'm still angry that my favorite character from Melee wasn't finished in time for Brawl (Roy)
holy fuck brawl came out 4 years ago?
AdamTheDuck no. I don't have a working Java enabled and my stream is fine
AdamTheDuck...try updating flash?
Buytoast feel old now?
I got a wii but I doubt ill play at midnight
Your Google Chrome browser already includes Adobe® Flash® Player built-in. Google Chrome will automatically update when new versions of Flash Player are available." ponyshrug.jpg
SuperBrony64: ive got a PS3. Acari13. if your going to add me, at least tell me you found me in this chat room
Hmmm...go back to your chrome://plugins menu and double-check it all.
11,02Oh, I thought you wanted me to play Brawl so we could play on stream ><
Also, make sure Chrome is up to date. An older version of Chrome may have an older version of Flash.

I don't really think WoW's gonna lose that many to GW2.
scottish-geeky if I say "inb4 *whatever*", then what I said will appear later on in a conversation. It's used commonly on forums and chatrooms.
SuperBrony64: thanks for streiming

Thank you SuperBrony64 for the awlays awesome stream.

Canadian_Brony: ohhh ok
Today a bunch of girls where talking about Skyrim. I went to talk to them after class and I asked them "Have any of you played Morrowind?" They asked "What's Morrowind."
Thanks for the stream SB
Stream over :(
AdamTheDuck: it was fun for a while, but after continuous downgrading i started feeling robbed. havent played it since cataclysm came out. i think i'm gonna terminate my account now
00,10more wind? there is't even a breese
:O
ya Wrek
YAY! BLOOD!
scottish-geeky now if only I couldn've gotten a simple explanation like that for the "Where was gondor" meme.
Wrek stream?
Dark_Horst, Ah I remember the times when there weren't any expansion packs :3
Cataclysm did kinda suck...from everything I've done in the MoP beta, though, things are looking up.
when the lvl cap was still 60
Canadian_Brony: lol
God this is violent
Doomguy is pissed!
what wad is this?
AdamTheDuck: startd with burning crusade. was still fun though
11,02SNES version? :D
lol
guns a last resort for wen your knukles start to hurt
00,10cant be the nes version, this is good.
)_0
Dat foot
SuperBrony64: nah, a mod
this reminds me of the doomguy comic
Is this a mod?
scottish-geeky first time I said I didn't get it, nitt said "Where was Gondor when Lunar_Brony didn't get it"
CURB STOMPING TIME
Nah, this is the version for the Sega Neptune
Sumica, oh god there was an NES version.
11,02SNES is best though :<
MASF Yep
11,02It uses the Super FX chip ;A;
Canadian_Brony: lol yah
MASF123: a SNES version :D
this is the mostb violent game ever
so this is where dead space god the curbstomping from
*got
so far i like this
that ws rather frustrating or me
MadSurge Sumica said there was an NES version
*foe
This is a mod right... RIGHT!?
**FOr
MASF123 Lemme check
TheRandomkid321: yep
my keyboard's acting up
00,10no thre was no nex or snes so dar as i know
SuperBrony64 Super FX chip?
Ihop: you never heard about Manhunt then
00,10just n64
nope
oh
all this needs is death metal
so much delicious blood
Sumica: there was a SNES version of Doom
Dark_Horst: (\
11,02MASF123: The chip that came with certain SNES games to help improve the graphics capabilities of the system specifically for that game. Like Yoshi's Island, Star Fox, etc.
scottish-geeky: /)
CHANE SAW FTFW
00,10wow that must have been hard to port
SuperBrony64 I heard that chip was used to make 3D for Star Fox 2.
11,02MASF123: It was going to be used for that game as well, but they never released the game.
STREAM!!
It got leaked but...not really retail.
Sumica: they had to remove a lot. That's why Id made Noah's Ark possible
00,10SuperFX was used in whole freanchise of games
Wrek is playing a Doom game
Just to get back at Nintendo
dead
11,02If you look on the bottom of certain SNES games, like the ones I mentioned, they have extra connectors to the SNES compared with regular SNES cartridges to allow the Super FX to work with the processor in the SNES unit.
DED
lol...Super Noah's Ark.
I played it and I will say the framerate was bad but the game was fun.
OtakuTom, AVGN?
OtakuTom: lol
00,10was't superFX basixly like what the 32x tryed to be.
Yea
Oh SEGA and their gimmicks.
But now Nintendo's doing that as well.
00,10nintendo has been doing it long before now
all the murder it so pritty
I need to play Doom
Yea...the power glove is the perfect example of them trying to be gimicky
Canadian_Brony: yes you do mate
It's SOOOO Bad.
The Power Glove.
Well remember that Nintendo was once a Toy COmpany, so I can see why they were like that when they started out.
The Chainsaw. Rngdgdgddrngdrgnd!
But now...it's getting ou of hand with their accesories.
They originally made playing cards
For real?
wow
what he needs is THE BIG FUCKING GUN 9000
If you can't see it, kick it.
scottish-geeky fuck yeah!
When they first started in 1889 (yes, the 19th century :P), they produced and marketed a card game called Hanafuda
Duke's Mighty Boot.
Canadian_Brony: (\ horaa
scottish-geeky /)
I think my favorite piece of Nintendo History trivia is that they once tried to run a chain of Love Hotels in Japan...lol
OtakuTom: lol
wow
that's . . . interesting
They also worked with Sony once.
:O
Nintendo has lasted for a loooong time.
true
not as long as me
wait what?
hi Panda
hiya Canadian_Brony :D
Panda your shlang is long? :O
come on just puch the s** out of the cyborg deomn
Nintendo has been around since the 19th century when they sold a card came
MASF123 O-o when did I say that?
dat skull
"not as long as me."
MASF123 *last* you know... duration of time. I'm not sure where you got length from xD
hell ya
Well they say Japanese people have very very small penis.

:D
11,02lol wut
wish it be nice to have a few who like MLP here in my area of the world...
Hay Pearly
SuperBrony64 xD I said Canadian_Brony was from austria...
Hello Pearly :)
I disconnected btw
Panda there need to be new fonts for text to help tell the difference between legit and sarcasm
Dat PERFECT
Canadian_Brony... >_>
Use that emote
hey there Jmo and MadSurge
Canadian_Brony I can put it italicized... if erm... I wont get kicked for it.
Panda: you're so silly, and I do like star trek it's just I haven't gotten around to seeing most of it
MASF123| tell that to Panda, not me
/me pokes Jmo
/me glomps Pearly
I still think we should have it
Hey Panda! Use this emote. >_>
MASF123| erm... that doesnt do the emote on my client
/me falls to the ground giggling and hugs jmo
:3
:D
oh wow Panda
Panda that is why we need new fonts to display what emotes can't.
or we just need to be more creative with out emotes
Sumica, are italics just like colors on bronystate?
/me Panda these are italics
/me use they are.
/me yes
00,10they will trigger a kick script yes
Canadian_Brony you can put in a command for it.
Sumica oh okies ^^ didnt wanna trigger it.
Lol. Sumica. Thanks for the warning.
00,10no those are not italics Canadian_Brony, just the web client desplays them as such
Sumica alright. I get it now
I think . . .
/me shrugs
00,10bold, ittalic and underlined will trigger the script
00,10as well as color.
...but I can do that on another channel Sumica?
00,10depends
In the Spike room people kept using colored text
Spike has no chat tho
00,10Spike is not our room
One day on movie night
oh.
I'm thinking of the theatre
nvmd
08,01okay people
08,01should i do somethign crazy?
I love how the music is relatively calm
08,01and stay at work for another 7 hours?
SO Bronystate controls 6 rooms, but 7th room belongs to someone else? Sumica
00,02also hi
08,01if i stay at work another 7 hours, i'll have been working for 24 hours straight
08,01pah! sleep!
I'm insane
Your gonna work later regardless so...
08,01but srsly, yeah, i'm not gonna do that... i think sleep is required
00,107 rooms
sleep
keep your insanity
7 rooms, 7 Chaos Emeralds.
don't be . . . sane *shudders*
08,01i need to stay here for another hour and a half at least, because i've got a meeting with my supervisor
00,10spike some one else made after we had the spike theader. probably trying to impersonate one of our rooms
ok sure
Sumica...that makes things comfusing.
I don't think Wrek's a fan of the chainsaw.
00,10only for those useing stand alone chats MASF123|
00,02seems the chat embed is down
what does that mean?
00,10it meens dont refresh your chat Canadian_Brony
k
what if he derps?
So...what you mean is other lightIRC chats can invite others to their chats? As in everyone is link to one server? :O
Panda that's what I was about to ask
00,10unfortunatly the chat embed is handled by ponychat
00,10yeah MASF123|
00,10it's all one network
Holy crap.
oh killerpony7733 you still up?
00,10but our embed only connects to our chats unless you know how to connect to other chats
strange I guess that erm guy knows how to do that.
or was it ehm?
I forgot his nickname it has 3 letters
00,10it's not exactly hard
MASF123| I can help you with getting a client if you'd like
ehm.
Thanks Panda
00,10it's just /join and then the channle name
sounds easy enough
That I know...SuperBrony64 told me that.
Sumica he would have to connect to the ponychat network first~
WHat I mean is make a new channel and invite others to it.
00,10well if he is in chat here he is connected
00,02MASF123|, to make a new channel just join one that doesnt exist
00,10same way MASF123|
ok...so. Let me try this. I've done it before without knowing.
FATALITY
MASF123| well /invite (name here) would be the command.
i think
Has anypony heard of equestricon, the new (next may) con that's coming to Salt Lake?
Pinkies4thWall D: there is one there?
MASF123| is exactly as Phase4 says but if you want for the channel to exist forever u have to register it.
NET SPLIT!
HAHA
Panda: yeah, I'm planning on going
Like that?
/me 00,02ducks while the net is split

Alchemist: :D pony SCP!
00,02Canadian_Brony, when a server disconnects from the network
It's a muffin.
XDXDXDXDXD
ah
Panda: hes been triple kicked before
So, SuperBrony64. Add me on Face?
11,02A net split is where one of the IRC servers goes haywire and thus forces you to connect to a separate server.
:kickcount Panda
that's what you get for causing the netsplit, Panda ! ;)
Panda: that is why you need to use full stops and space and commas instead of enter
Dat Pearly
Awwww... :(
pl
but the net split wasnt me D:
*ok
what Phase4 said
11,02Pinkies4thWall: I hate Facebook o-o

G'night SuperBrony64|Zzz. Sleep well.
/me cuddles SuperBrony64|Zzz
11,02It was garbage.
/me hugs XAX ^-^
How so?
Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
11,02They announced a bunch of Japan titles that would either never get released in the US or would take at least two years and finally talked about games we knew about already.
WHAT
That's bull
I kinda hurts to look at Monster Hunter 4 and Bravely Default footage.
11,02Probably the best news was a new Professor Layton game.
SuperBrony64|Zzz, WOOOOOOOOOOOT
PROFESSOR LAYTON <3
You mean the fifth one I knew about already?
11,02But the worst news was that it's going to be the last Layton game.
Awwwwwwwwwwww.....
wait
11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Nope, sixth one.
Oh
I
kinda knew about that one too
kinda neat to know it's on its way
11,02How? They /just/ announced it.
I saw how the creator had a sixth planned long ago
we'll have to wait 3 years for it to reach NA anyway.
when the fifth was announced for Japan
11,02Either way, it was officially announced today.
neato
but was MH4 in that list of japan games that won't be here?
11,02And it's going to be the last Professor Layton game/
I don't mind that
11,02Don't know.
11,02Still waiting for Monster Hunter 3 to come out on the 3DS here.
Layton has enough game in my opinion and it has been a fun ride
WAIT SuperBrony64|Zzz DO YOU HAVE TRI ON WII?
11,02Yeah
that means....
11,02Indeed.
OH GOD we must hunt sometime
11,02O.O

Yay Phasepony!
Hi bronystate.
Hello tehere FillyFlam
You remember which model Vivix?
there*
howdy FillyFlam
Jmo, no sorry, it was something that was on discount at the computer store a few years back
Fairo
I'm going to replace them with M-Audio I think, anyway- upgrade while I'm at it
I loved the guy that made the Marvin impression :D
Which ones Vivix o.o
Not sure yet, but eh- 600 dollar range, I figure
:D
Though, someone said I should buy headphones as well, so might --have to lower that, not sure
Bleh headphones
I like the girl too :D
Why you ask?
Not loud enough >__>
Just curious :3
true, hehe
08,01louder!
I want M-Audios for mixing, and something like JBL for practice-
like active PA
Ah JBL, my father goes crazy over those.
DEM PPG SOUNDS
08,01i have a pair of Etymotic Research ER-4S'
08,01they are MARVELOUS
i have a pair of.......headphones
I would rather gouge my ears out then use those ;~;
So what's debian?
aah, yeah. I'm not sure what I want for mixing, would be nice to have somethign I can use at night
exciting real time linux action
but yeah for practice I want something that's loud enough- so a floor pa would be neat
gota do something while i'm waiting for respawn
installing native from inside a vm
because screw you microsoft
08,01Phase4: yay debian!
Phase4, That's the spirit Phase4 !
08,01i do have my gripes with it, but it's a very nice, and stable, OS
Fight the powah!
BronyInstrumental, yeah JBL is nice, our neighbourroom in school blew out theirs and had to pay the school for it-
08,01and i generally prefer Debian Testing over Ubuntu
We never got ours loud enough to beat the drums, strangely enough
Insanity ._.
wait, what Vivix? i have no idea what a JBL is
>.>
woops wrong ping, Jmo*
eh BronyInstrumental they're PA speakers
I feel defiled and thrown away.
;~;
Mistaken for another person. THE HORROR
/me hugs Jmo tightly, and rubs his back
08,01NOW KISS
Na.
/me sucks Jmo's face
Good enough.
/me is doing it wrong
08,01shipping shipping shipping, a fine shipping with you
08,01Phase4: aye, because stable is stable, but stagnant
:D VYNIL!
makes sense
when I used linux, I'd play the included games, mess around with installs and break down crying
It was lovely days, though
that thing ubuntu has
08,01linux mint?
08,01oh aye
http://derpibooru.org/78468?scope=scpe2e8d68f2563155f62c4766eedfccfb8fdc59556e she will do it
does debian have anything like that?
they're just normal deb repo's afaik but its nice to have them centralized
thelonepony, dat image

uncounted downloads :3
RaveBrony: good, just finished breakfast and chilling in my dorm lobby
theres something windows doesnt do, they dont do cdn deals with anyone
has to come straight from microsofts servers
plus their protocal/usage is aparently very hard on cache's
Sounds nice, Sylandest :o
internode (my isp) runs a file mirror, so free linux packages
RaveBrony: it is, for the time being. No one here to try and peek over my shoulder, at the least, for which I'm thankful
Oh, haha :D

Good night, gentlemen.

Good night XAXzzz

No you haven't ;~;
I have like 580 hours... I might have a problem :I
something like that D=
altogether i've played about 12 hours :D
Registry started..when? 2009?
Hardstyle? O.o
I dont play that much. I get maybe 5-7 items during the week and stop playing :D
/me hide in fear
5.3 hours on record in TF2
and I boht it in ..2007 or something
bought*
i get like 2 items every week, it gets tedious
COIN NOISES
Mare do well? Never seen her :S
You have to play on a fun, silly, server :P
It keeps you playing :)
RaveBrony: i would play more if i had access to it :D
Are these pony models more recent? :D
It is a fun game when I play with my friends, but I only have one friend who played it a lot, and after hte update I don't have a good enough connection to download it
Aha, it's Saxton hale.. Thought it was MLP Heroes :S
I think so, they dont scare me :D
RaveBrony: Ikr
I think I have about 300+- some since 2009 :/
!
I HATED being against Fluttershy and Rarity, i would run in terror! :D
I can't remember where I see when I got a game
*FS or Rarity
I should try if this laptop can run TF2 at a decent speed... maybe tonight
i've only been playing since this year, so i don't have much experience with it
I registered to steam October 2003
Haven't played in a long time though
Pearly has returned
Mare Do Well??
but seeing as i have played it much less than most, i think i'm pretty good at it :D
Havent seen that one :o
Hey, Pearly
I'm decent at it, but I loose interest and die a lot near the end
Pearly! :3

/me hugs Dragonnmate and alexxm back
/me high fives FillyFlam Pearly RaveBrony and BronyInstrumental
To think he and i shared the same name
ALL THE PINKIES!
LOL
holy crap
so much pinkie
Dark92Enigma: Sorry to hear that :'(
PINKIE
Pinkie, usually i enjoy YOU being random....
but not this time
RD@
MLP is not even 2 years old and episode in season 1 are considered classics
how odd
oh, that sounds terrible Dark92Enigma :(
THEFUCK
/me highhooves tSparx :D
Dark92Enigma: anything we can do to help?
CrimsonPhoenix I hope there won't be a war about what was the best season after S3
I'm better now.......i gotta find when is the funeral
Lil_B, OF COURSE there will
btw whats on the tream right now?
I can't wait for the complaints that Season 3 was when the show started going downhill...
MadSurge: i'll be fine.......
Of course, I hope it isn't. It probably won't be. But people are gonna say it no matter how good it is.
Just like simpsons
Every season is "worst season ever" until next season
tSparx: Just like Spongebob
of course, simpsons fans are much angrier
tSparx the show was way better when they just used to ... instead of ... end when they did ... they petrayed the FANS!
I CAN'T RESIST ANYMOAR.
!
MadSurge but a hug will do just fine
Lil_B ^^dat^^
UDDED
wa u sai jaymoo
Don't talk to me hater ;~;
Lil_B: what show yoou be talking about?
GTFO Matt Smith lover
Jmo u so random
MadSurge MLP
YOU WANNA GO?
MadSurge: The inevitable convo about Ssn 3
DAVID TENNANT WAS BEST DOCTOR, BUT MATT SMITH IS STILL GREAT.
Lil_B, that's pretty much arguments general
Lil_B: when they did betray the fans? When Maggie talked?
U WOT M8
I'LL WHOOP YOUR ARSE AYE.
Exactly
Dark92Enigma not yet, it was a hypotetical angry comment for people after S3
I'LL FUCKIN' 'AVE YE
People say that about new seasons, no matter what the show usually. Of course simpsons fans are teh angriest and will always say that
Lil_B was quoting the future.
YEAH.
CrimsonPhoenix yeah... it's always the same
Lil_B: what was it? PM me if it's neccesary
Lil_B: careful with that, people might not tell the difference from a true complaint :D
PINKIE DED
MadSurge yeah... next time I need to indicate the irony better :P
Lil_B: S3 will be great :$
Dark92Enigma here you go :P "the show was way better when they just used to ... instead of ... end when they did ... they petrayed the FANS!"
Lil_B, it was fine as it is
people just don't scroll up to check the contest
ever
yeah
context even
People will say that, and we will be sad and defensive, but people always say things like that
MadSurge Probably... if tehy will finally anounce the start !!!
Just look at when they said "S4 is worst simpsons ever! Original writers left Rarararar!" and now it's considered one of the best
CrimsonPhoenix: I've noticed many times how much text on this channel goes into repeating information that we talked about earlier.
Lil_B: they be trolling :D
Of course, that's a universal problem on IRC, not just here on #BronyState
MadSurge I see it coming... next Ssaturrday at 7pm middle european time ... someone is screaming in the chat "GUYS TURN ON THE HUB FOR GOD SAKES!!!!!"
CELESTIA
Lil_B: In which episode they did that? They broke the fourth wall!
Lil_B: exactly :D
Dark92Enigma none, I made that up myself :P
Who's streaming right now anyway?
Phase4 i think
Lil_B: Oh. About the Simpsons, right?
tSparx, i am
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fw7hNSHg1qzcdbeo1_1280.jpg Pizza of the century
Dark92Enigma no, MLP someone else mentionedthe Simpsons :)
/me turn on someLast inja C64 Music
celestia is demoman
Dat accent
What was the question now?
BASH
mv /users/maxwell/love/allMyLove.lve /users/phase4
o_O
Lil_B: Oh. And when they betray the fans? I don't feel betrayed
Dark92Enigma: He was quoting the future
POOTIS
Dark92Enigma: Sample-text, the inevitable reaction of some fans to Ssn 3
Que n Que?
Who likes scaling charts?
http://i.imgur.com/EdcI9.png
OH! now i get it..........I HOPE IT'S NOT TRUE!
Dark92Enigma, it will
Dark92Enigma: True or not, people will say it
I still see some debates about Season 1 and 2 to this day in /mlp/
Which reminds me of Spongebob........what is the worst SB episode in your opinion?
everything after the movie
good thing I don't go to 4chan... or any site that ends with chan
Most distros hate you messing with grub.
Lil_B, I'm glad you at least don't go in Ponychan
It's annoying.
that place is like those futuristic society where everyone cannot think and where there's a Big Brother watching your every move
i don't know i never really watched spongebob
Personally, i guess Atlantis Squarepantis is the worst of all time
TWILIGHT THEME!!!!
That is the worst episode IMO.
Now i feel pumped!!!!!
TWILIGHT SPARKLE*
All singing no plot...it was garbage.
Yay
<3 Debn Daglish
Ben*
Yay.
AFK people are gone.
97 active
I heard this song alive! :D
*live
MadSurge: I heard this song as a zombie.
/me throws cabbages at tSparx
MASF123: What pisses me off the most, is all the buildup for it......toys, commercials, a videogame spinoff (WAY better than the ep IMO) and WHAT was the result? NOTHING
/me loves cabbages
TWI!!! NOOO!
(not really)
MY CABBAGES!!!!!!!!
Dark92Enigma: Fffft :D
hahaha
We should have an Avatar (TLAB) marathon sometime
Come on, you were expecting that joke
Dark92Enigma, what are you exactly talking about?
It's an Avatar reference
Avatar TLAB
This poor dude, everywhere Team Avatar went, they accidentally ruined his cabbages.
One of the funniest running gags in the history of running gags.
CrimsonPhoenix: i was talking about Atlantis Squarepantis......then i made an Avatar reference (the most infamous meme from the series)
yeah Atlantis Squarepants
mind to enlight me some more about that one episode?
CrimsonPhoenix: good to hear that, for i will review that single ep when i start my own show on YouTube
here it goes
CrimsonPheonix remember Atlantis? In Neptune's Spatula?
in PM

Pearly: Was Gidget the cartoon with the purple alien that turned into things?
Gold_Demona: I saw Mr Ed only once, it was fun :D

Cya Phase
Cya Phase4!
bye Phase4
hm. wonder.
who all would purchase skullgirls on steam here? (since you lot are mostly PC gamers.)
I don't know what skullgirls is
skullgirls is a game
Pearly: Oh yeah! I was thinking of Widget. nvm XD
Never heard of it O.o
Morning
Hey StinkomanFan
morning StinkomanFan
how you doing StinkomanFan
Skullgirls.... UGH
never heard of skullgirls
MASF123 is it good
*looks it up* Oh, it's a fighting game.
Obviously made for guys
Oh fighting game?
Gold_Demona, I only care that its a fighter. >.>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ICI8WABfE wwwuuuuttt?
I dont really care for fighting games.
It's well animated. I'll give 'em that.
Meh
Barbetos|AtWork: Dafuq is that? :D
Gold_Demona, but I did know that cartoon... about the purple alien
Fighting games isn't my thing, and adding "girls for the sake of sales" just makes it totally uninteresting
I mean, I dont want to RE-BUY it is no one here is going to play it. thats why I ask.
Vivix, it isnt for the sake of sales, its what Alex Ahad wanted to draw. simple as that.
RaveBrony: I don't know. =o
There are not serious videos about it
But there is a channel apparently. I'd watch it
:P
well, I won't judge it without playing it, but scantily clad women makes me not buy games
Pearly: Oooh, I watched that! :)
in general that is
Jiggle jiggle.
Hey WallDives!
Vivix, thats all I ask. if you play fighting games, give it a run, at least.
and sup MadSurge.
also, since there isnt really any other GOOD fighters on PC...
I have a friend who's crazy into fighting games, maybe he knows it. He's a big guilty gear fan or something-
I'd maybe play it if I get in the mood for a fighter, but I wouldn't pay for a game THAT full of fanservice.
WallDives, what game?
Skullgirls.
oh yeah
Vivix: trust a noob fighter, Skulgirls is both very simple and complicated, and it's a lot of fun to play :D
I heard some good stuff from that
trying to spread the good word.
Besides, titties don't make me buy stuff.
also, trying to get back at DCD for that assbeating he handed me a month or so back.
-_-
:D
I haven't really played any fighters since arcades closed down
If I wanted to see titties, I'd look in a mirror, which I don't do much anyway cuz I'm not that good looking.
Hehe
It just bugs me in games like FF, it makes no sense that they'd wear so little clothes- and it bugs me enough to avoid the game
MadSurge, which cartoon was that?
love how the first thing people go to is sex appeal.
Gold_Demona, you are pretty
:D
Vivix, ikr? thats why I stick to the earlier FFs...
Pearly: the purple transforming alien
remember that
Pearly: lol, How would you know? =P
MadSurge, yeah what was it called?
Gold_Demona: I bet you're more interested in abs :D
Pearly: MadSurge: Widget. It was called Widget
OH, I just know so..
Pearly: beats me
ahhh widget...
Oh, there you go :D
haha gidget widget
haha
i know a game is good when the first thing i do is try and have sex with it
*giggles*
WallDives, hehe, yeah- I haven't played those much, but yeah
Ihop, thats how I know a game is bad. >.>
hehe
I like Alyx Vanze, she's a woman, but it's not really important that she is
She's an important character- you know
you know its bad when you can sucsede
*succeed
haha I am watching MLP and they are talking to discord.. but celestia was talking to them and pinkie pie was off to the side "ph look we are famous"
oh*
WallDives: I bought Lollipop Chainsaw because of Suda 51, zombies and Tara Strong, not for the sexy cheerleader :D
good lad. (I'm still waiting on MAX anarchy.)
I..walked away slowly
Because seeing Twilight Sparkle kill zombies with a chainsaw is worth 60 dollars alone.
dat game
I have noo idea what that game is about, it might be good, but the boxart scared me away
you shouldnt jusge a game by its cover, but bad covers costs millions in sales anyway. :P
Yeah- I'm not sure what the game is about, but hte poster was so 'porny' I just know that I could not buy that with a straight face
Woah
Internet derp
Sounds sexy
Catherine
Nice puzzle game
yeah
with some crazy dating sim story
I mean the wallpaper for the game is her with her legs spread to the camera- and some guy blocking it
well I guess the dreams are more crazy then the actual dating sim part
it might be really cool dark and surreal, but- yeah
there's like 8 ending in that game
so it's a fun game?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErv6ol6ZC0
and then people played visual novels where theres like 30 endings.
it is quite
and kinda hard
It's a pretty fun game, although I suck at the puzzles.
Geneforge is a great game
problem is, I'm not fan of straightromance in my fiction
but- puzzles are fun
so I miight check it out of its on sale on steam or something some day
Catherine is a good game.
Very difficult however
wut^
They made a Free DLC which is "Very Easy" mode.
Just because the difficulty was hard on Easy Mode.
well the story is about a guy that cheated on his GF that wants to move their relationship so now the guy is stuck between the two and has to choose his action
Also she's pregnant. Lol.
mind you he unintentionally cheated
brunk and all
drunk**
I would still leave my guy if he got drunk and cheated, if I had any
Katherine is his childhood friend and girlfriend, she wants to mary but Vincent doesn't want that commitment.
but one girl doesn't know about the other
Vivix: I don't think its on steam, I believe it's only for 360 and PS3.
yeah
ahh, I don't have either
also, other things.
360 and PS3
FUNFACT
It's on Xbox and PS3.
I got the shirt of the game :3
and the pillowcase....and the boxers
CrimsonPhoenix, do you have Vincent's boxers?
yeah
warning
LOL. I want those. They look like the one Arthur wears from Ghouls N Ghosts. :D
not recommend to use as actual boxers
lol.
I bought a MERRII cd , Identiy colelctors edition, it came with young girl panties
japanese bands are weird
but I wear the shirt occasionaly
o.o
MASF123: Boo, Catherine on easy mode :D
Vivix, Japanese bands are uber weird to me
I grew up with almost only japanese music
I think I got the game on normla
not anime related, but yeah
MadSurge what do you mean?
/me pokes Vivix
DAFUQ did you do with them.
MASF123: I always skip Easy mode :D
I put them on the cd, I can't throw out collectors items ;__;
ok this discussion convince me
I'm in the UK, so it got released about a year after, and I only had a 360, so I couldn't import the deluxe edition
I NEED to continue my game
>__>
oh yeah
They were'nt used, and I doubt they were made to be worn
I bought Dragon's Dogma recently
MadSurge all I said was it was complained in the review that the game was too difficult, so they made an Very Easy mode difficulty.
It's just the thought of what in the hell would YOU of done with them.
It's a free DLC
Hehe, IIi didn't do nothing, but I'm pretty sure tons out there did
CrimsonPhoenix: Is that game any good, the demo was good albeit easy.
I don't know
MASF123: I did it on normal, without a guide. Got the ending I wanted, even if my brain was starting to overheat on certain puzzles :D
I was too busy playing Dust to care
Whenever I come home from gamestop, I get games that lay in their plastic for months
lol
3for2!
So cheap!
so tempting
That's where I buy games I'm curious about, but don't want to pay full price for
Vivix, uh....who doesnt?
Gold_Demona, remember fantastic max?
MASF123: whiny babies IMHO :D besides, it's ATLUS.
I know, right?
ATLUS is the truth.
just saying.
Pearly: you mean MIGHTY Max :D
Pearl: Nope. Don't remember any Fantastic Max. I remember a Mighty Max, though.
MadSurge what about ATLUS?
I still have that stupid Pizza box
MASF123: they're notorious for releasing hard as bricks games
oh
Well never heard of them until Catherine so...
oh gosh if only I could stream that shi
first atlus game I played was Snowboard Kids.
MASF123, Persona?
Shin Megami Tensei?
Snowboard Kids?
DEMON SOULS.
Catherine kicked my ass, but I eventually got through it, and it felt very rewarding, bur I don't think I should have played on hard on my first playthrough
^
DEMON SOULS YES
EggWhite: nope :D
Even the third party Atlus games are hard, like Demon Souls
'Morning everypony
I think I saw every stage atleasted 80 times. But I prevailed!
Oh god demon's souls...
EggWhite: at least the music is awesome :)
It b Dovah
it b Jmo
MadSurge: True true.
Sorry...disconnected what were you saying ChrimsonPhoenix?
/me cookies and pie for breakfast = :)
MASF123, I was just stating some games from Atlus
All this talk about Atlus makes me wanna play Persona 3: FES again, but my ps2 died...because I played to much Persona on it
I only heard of Persona because YuriofWind talked about it and people won't shut up about it.
I know it's an ATLUS game however.
The main character shoots himself in the head activating his "Persona"
It's similar to Final Fantasy's turn style gameplay.
turn based
MASF123|: think Pokemon for adults too, because you can win over some enemies into joining you :D
For Adults? :S
MASF123|: you either bribe them or talk them into it
I want to play persona 4, but no PS2.
q_q
so i CAN MAKE SENSE OF PS4A
WallDives: I could play it, but can't find the game!
The music is like some Japan culture pop music I heard.
ded chat? no stream? ???
i guess
prettycalmyeah
a bit of both Dovah but how are you doing
/me space fail
alexxm: borded
huh ded cha
where is everyone
I was playing music, done and tired now
We're all ded
yay, dead.
I am waiting for conversation to start so I can get my morning lolz :|
(mfw I almost used color for 'dead')
hehe
INSTAKICKGO
There was a long gameconvo but it's over now
yep.
i missed a game convo? wtf... :|
yep.
About japanese puzzle games I think
that makes me a sad pa- um pony :(
MadSurge, yeah
I know I started it with skullgirls, and then it went off on its own.
yeah
because we were talking about oversexualized covers.
that show was weird
which lead to catherine.
Pearly, what show?
Mighty Max?
Mighty Max>
/me wild guess

Hey guys, preordered the first FiM comic issue :D
Nice
I wonder hwo long before it shows up as a pdf on the internet
ikr.
Now i kind of wis hI would of gotten some of the game cards that came out
what with the cease and disist order from hasbro and all
I'm kinda glad it hasnt.
dont want it to be EVERYWHERE. that would accelerate the fan burnout.
I am not all that big on collecting pony things
I would be just fine with a t shirt
and maybe a plush
I blame wednesday for dead chat.
maybe.
also, school restarting, and whatnot...
05might start stream in a minute
05depends on how long this takes
Wrek stream, yes!
oh yeah
/me quietly hopes for more Doom
I wanted to go back to school but my full time job ruined that. =\ That and I did not try very hard to get back into a class, but that is besides the point XD
MadSurge: Brutal Doom is so awesome
I should install it.
I am so glad id does what they do with their source code, or we would never get awesome stuff like Brutal Doom
I wonder what people would do wit hthe source code of id tech 4
probably make they're own doom games
You don't see a lot of stand alone games coming from the source code
Althought id tech 3 had an awesome game
http://tremulous.net/ that
lots of fun
Humans v aliens
Alien vs. Hunter
Speaking of Humans V Aliens I can't wait for Natural Selection 2 to be completed

Wrek: what song is this, if you dont mind me asking ^_^
05doom 2 OST
Wrek I dun think you can do it in Skyrim actually
Wrek kicked me a few seconds ago for being awesome.
I love the OCRemix version of that song from the Doom Album i think it's called "31 Seconds" or something
That BerryPunch didn't count that kick.
There are specific things you have to do in the main quest that can not be progressed unless you kill.
Hooray, Doom music!
/me kicks barbetos
Barbetos|AtWork: does summoning count as fighting?
Barbetos|AtWork: dragons are nice guys actually, im sure theyll listen if youre nice
:kickcount otakon
MASF123: otakon has been kicked 11 times
otakon is MLG

Alchemist its probably the only way really.
blarghlgrrah! I want to make a new character on New vegas but I also want to play Dragon age cuz I love fantsy/medival games.
someone made the beat of this song a wrestling theme...its cool
http://derpy.me/8ahKB
ok Doom 2 Album "Doom II: Delta-Q-Delta" songs 9 "31 Sec" XD
Barbetos|AtWork: in the last main quest I think your companions can do the work for you too
but i like first person games, but DA has a great story imo...
what do i do!!!??!
im not sure, but if you have high enough illusion you could try to keep healing/couraging the guards to kill dragons
Wrek, you said you've been kicked many times, but BerryPunch said 0 times last time I checked.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Story of My Life (Update Complete!)
thats probably the closest to not killing
05BerryPunch only counts her own kicks
Figures
:kickcount otakon
Bronysith: otakon has been kicked 11 times
Lol. Makes sense.
BerryPunch is now boring
HA
05:kickbot make me a sandwich

:kickcount BerryPunch
Lil_B, what is it?
Dovah: BerryPunch has been kicked 0 times
MASF123: :D
Yes I made it sing! ^_^
And curiously the air date of the pilot of MLP: FiM is 101010 which equals 42 IIRC in binary.
and the spam has begun
and twilight sparkle has 42 points on her plot
So, in short. Ponies are the answer to life.
The spam has sprung
:kickcount BerryPunch drinks too much.
AJIsAwesome: BerryPunch drinks too much. has been kicked 0 times
and her number in running of the leaves was 42
I loved the music from the original Doom on the last level of the first episode. it was so fitting.
dat flank

Wrek: so is the answer to the universe twilights plot?

Why u no english yet?!?
