Suddendly, returned!
05cant we jsut enjoy some metal?
05jeez
05i need a drink
^
^^^
Now I'm not gonna drag out this topic, because there's no point to it. They're gone.
05seems like it
Heh. Twilight sitting there reading while listining to metal.
05beer, vodka, snaps
/me also grabs some rum
Hello all
stupid physics
/me restrains his angry breathing.
derp
05mariestad, staropramen
05maybe guinnes
Ggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
05not right now
05but i usualyl do
Oh wow.
This is amamzing.
05nothing sates my thirst like a proper cold beer of eitehr of those 3 brands
It is the quenchiest!
05Malavolent: try mariestad
I may have to try and find taht one. My hubby and I usually drink Yeungling
that*
05Malavolent: ofc not
05you'd have to import it
And metal ofc.
05tuborg is all rigth aswell
05dinenr beer
05Spendrups is good
i have no take on this topic, as i've never tasted alcohol, apart from maybe in foods, just never straight from the bottle
Hot chocolate + Kahlua
I just do shots of vodka and gin every once and a while.
Not too much of a drinker, really.
05rebull and vodka
05the sleeziest shot there is
05but damn does it work
Lol, sleezy.
Just crappy beer.
05thats why youtake it properly
05liek a GOOD beer
05or a GOOD drink
I find that drinks like beer and wine are best had accompanied with food
05never liked jägermeister
05also: http://gronahuset.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/mariestads.jpg
Whereas liquors and mixes of such can be had on their own
I can't drink alcohol. Just the smell of it gives me a headache.
I like Goldschlagger (sp?)
my brothers ipod is locked for about 22,000,000 minutes
which is about 0.7 years
he'll be waiting for a while
Food cooked with alcohol however... burns my stomach.
22429288 minutes to be precise
I mix my drinks now because I'm a lot more responsible with the amount I consume. XP
drummers aren't musicians, they're percussionists
I mix my drinks because all we have is beer, wine a little bit of brandy and brandy is too expensive
Eh. He can deal with it.
But he did say "fawk you".
I've heard several chefs say "never cook with a wine you wouldn't drink"
No idea. probably real. not like I drink that much
that just seems logical
if you cant drink something why would you use it as an ingredient
the crap is cooking wine?
Wait. There's actual cooking wine?
Like wine. For cooking?
Yes
Wut.
why is that a market that exists
05always remember
i meen cooking chocolate i can understand (it actually comes out nice after being heated) but cooking wine o_O
05alwasy remember fatehrs and sons of war
05love this song
In risotto and sauces
Sons of War.
yesh.
I've seen beer used to cook poultry.
Like whole chickens and turkeys.
the whole point of using wine as an ingredient is for the freking wine
BACK TO SCHOOL WORK
the worlds stupid can wait
Still need to explore the cooking world a bit.
^
Eating dishes with specially prepared wines and stuffs like that.
I find that wine is best enjoyed with a meal
Think Albert Einstein said that, not sure though. Too many random quotes in my bank of quote laying around my head. :3
I can't drink wine by itself. It's just nasty without any food to accompany it
Eesh. 5:30am. :P Time to hit the hay.
I stick with cider
05adn you eat it with eitehr ox fille or pock fille
And now I'm hungry again.
Thank you.

We can pretty much argue about things we like.

gamecube was my favorite console ever
I just noticed this, but it seems most of us here are gamers
Except the XL Ds
XD
Same here, because it was the first console I played back in the early 2000s, when I was um... 5 or 6 year old.
I don't know, I sucks at remembering sometimes.
First console I had was PS2, but I only really played GTASA on it
well- very first console was Sega something, but I can't remember much of the gamees
mmaybe, I have the controller here-
my first console was the sega megadrive, and i only ever played "sonic the hedgehog" on it
I prefer Melee over Brawl in terms of controls.
but it was just one machine-
The one about a little star.... Running aroubd getting more stars....

its called regenration
He likes dying apparently
How come he can regenerate by the way?

but he interrupted a regenration, dos that count?
why would they put a limit on it then?
Also an excuse to change the Doctor's personality
00,10the limit is presumed, no one knows
I don't believe it!
dat sickness
And then continue years later.
Without H.G Wells's The Time Machine, we wouldn't have Back To The Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and this.

Intuos 4 i think
He has time to grow up
He is using a wacom intouse4 if he has not upgraded
then you dont get the block as easily
I want Intuos for their rubbery tips- I like that resistance I get from paper
I'm amateur, I have a bamboo. :P
:P
me too but i suck too much to want to practice at all
My drawings are poorly drawn stick figures lol
I can't draw straight lines, but I can still draw
I would like to be good at drawing but just for fun not for work or anything
same here, I just do it for fun
I couldn't get a job in it anwyay, too much pressure for something I only occationally enjoy
wanna be good at something gotta put the time in :P
yep
i just realized those other alphas are me

I really like drawing real horses, but it's a bit hard still

Havent drawn since since the 1980s

Ember: whats OC?
My 'oc' is a deer, it would just fly away with rudolph powers
an OC is an Own Character
dat beard
The OC is MMMM WATCHA SAAAY
I think its just some unnamed stallion-
Applejack as a Valkyrie????? OH YES
does seem pretty viking though
mine would be on the other side of the coutrey in ten seconds flat
note the helmet
looks like stormcloak armor
Stohmklohk.
I used to be an adventurer like you, but then i became a pony.
Stormkappe
Oh.
well, the nord are pretty much vikings
lol
couldnt resist it, sorry
they just called them nord
?
I'm norwegian, I guess that line is pretty much all of it
Yup.
looks like nordic inscriptions to me.
Norweigee.
Looks like "runes" guys
Eg husker så fra lenge siden

I guess I'll see :)
No, Luna's from Deutschland.
IIRC.
hmm..yes
oh yeah I remember that
but I could have sworn that one of the mods were Dutch-
neverheard of that one
None of the current mods are Dutch, it seems.
I've been drawing some ponies on school
Like YOLO
:p
:p
found the bamboleo cover!
I used to draw ponies for decades ago
That would be swagging
SirGangalf yeah
1500s* to sway, a bulging bag, products given away for free, (modern, cheap drugs) and festoon
It probably has more than one meaning.
It probably stems from Old Norse "sveggja".
yyes probably-
It is.

/me 9has been arrowed in the knee
I think this is the part where I fell asleep XD
Haax! She dodged out of Tornado! That's impossible!
FFFFFFUUUUUUUU
or maybe shes saying hear
4D:
or maybe heir
you know of ALL the characters in the FF series
near
they could have had WAY more character
leer
beer
or at least more skins
fear
snear
queer
peer
beer
why is power girl fighting alextraza?
tear
FFIV is best FF cause you could visit Luna
For some reason I thought this was one of those 3D Touhou fighters.
not official
Well, yeah
VI has been my favorite ever since the first time I played it.
I still need to play the older 8 and 16 bit games...
11DEAR GOT
11FAIL
Some one die allready
meh
takes WAY too long
This dissidia?
sphere
4ROAR ZABIMARU
Just a few pics
i played the demo
brigadier

The music gives it away
yeah EX~!
/me hums Lavender Town music to give everyone nightmares

Sigh
13WAZZUP DUUUUDES!?
zzzzz
Esper!

Some of these fights go on for way too fucking long

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4569/
level 100 sephiroth
i think ill just leave it for now :P
Oh look its that song...
what's it holding
^
The Dissidia arrange is far and away the best.
7:3
A sword that long just seems counter productive
Tifa has the potential to be the strongest character in ff7 most of the time.
SEPHIROTH
oh yeah
that reminds me
counter
7Naked Flea ftw ._.

Hello! I'm back!
Still?
that's all that means
Punch count
Hello, everypony...
It's never gunna stop hurting, is it?
undergaaar
Thundaga

00,10numbers in middle are bonus damage for breaking

00,03Scoot Scootaloo~
sure...toying...
let's go with that <.< >.>
kay....
00,10he's waiting to get a full EX bar
idk
Huggy please
but the whole story just elevated the humour like 10 000 time more
yeah
then when that's depleted it goes to health
Yea, I understand how to read the health meter, just not how health is gained or lost.
health is lost by getting hit
yes
UNLEASE THE FURRY!!
no no NO
no unleashing furries dammit
no
aw
these matchups....
like Sabin
for GOD'S SAKE WHERE IS SABIN, YANG AND CYAN?
*Duodecim
FF8
8 I think
Okay. That makes some sence, then. Even though I've played Dissidia, I just couldn't understand how the health worked...lol
and pretty much most villain have no mercy nor compassion ano sympathy over their victim, thus why they are villains to begin with
FF6 music
wow full bar already
:(
airship iirc
00,10dis song
Oh, this music!
this isn't FF6 music is it?
oh crap it is

This person bases the music played on the stage? I base it on my enemy.
00,10loch I presume
00,10who?
Ouch
this was my favorite track form that gmae
Yea, Caramel's currently playing as Laguna from FF8.
Nobuo Uematsu.
what's the field in?
the composer of the music?
He's also got one of coolest theme songs, "The Man With The Machine Gun"
The voice acting.

I don't like FF8 that much
>start up psp
Pretty please?
well, that's all for me now

Lockon be pissed.
It's the purest insult to the creative domain
00,10no lockon yet
Right.
you could DRAW those face YOURSELF
i cant
I told him more about the chest pain
did i just see a LE EPIK RAGE FAEC comic linked?
that's horrible
that's like crapping in a pool and making the children swim next to it
the fact that it's accessible makes the thing lazy
does he know about ur heart fetish?
Yea
which gundam is this?
oh
And I know all about his fetish, heh heh heh
and the jokes are horrible even
whats his fetish? :P
oh yeah and the l"e"?
00,10ahhh
pee
you know
I have to ask
IT'S A FUCKING DISGRACE TO THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
haha cool
It needs to be about 20% cooler
00,10I like how they show the 0g in this
LOL RAGE COMICS
I tell him every time I pee xD
what's the point of le anyway? to be edgy?
^
"edgy"
XD
:D HARO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
00,10le sigh
....
Haro Haro Haro <3
le sets the light mood and silliness
not that goddamn worthless kinect crap
You can just make a simple face drawing as well
kinect is best console ever
I remember back when rage comics where only in 4chan
well, don't mind the people liking rage comic, as for me, no thanks
THEY MADE THEIR OWN DRAWING
00,10yes
thats probably pretty annoying haha
Hehe
gratuitous english words
seconda phasu
If I wanted motion controls I would use the Wii
Kinect < ps move < wii
I honestly liked the idea of Kinect, but the way it performs is terrible and I wish they invested more time in it.
at least someone is with me here
My opinion on memes: They need to be about 20% cooler
haha
I smell a kick?
must be one stinky kick
oh hey it's ada wong
why is she in gundam land
Idiot.
oh lookie a chinese dressed chick
I've never really seen any gundam at all.
Anyway goodnightbeverypony
If there's one good thing that the Kinect is good for, it's homebrew Motion Capture.
I hate the uniformal style this has
:(
For gods sake stop complaining and just watch the goddamn Gundams.
Overhyped too.
Kyrios....
Wait was that Allelujah's gundam?
no idea
oh wait it explains NOTHING
