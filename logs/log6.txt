12and I left it in the car when we went on a boat ride out in some really rough seas
12That would have made one hell of a video
did you know I was sailing once in school?^^
on the ijssel sea in the netherlands
14Lol.
6I've sailed a boat before
6my grandpa showed me how, so I sailed it around the Mediterranian Sea outside of Rome
6it was awesome <3
yeah, but also on storm force 10?
6no
well, we did^^
6but it was still awesome
/me 6runs

6I pictured an amusing sight
ahh, kk
/me 6sees a fox lift Arti up by the tail, set her down elsewhere, and push a vacuum across the floor where she was sitting
oO
LOL
btw. Aurora: The sailing was fun. I climbed down to the lower deck to grab something to eat and saw some of my friends being REALLY seasick...
I go to them and ask "Hey? Wanna have some chocolate or an apple or such?" - and they "Oooooooooo - get away! The pill's not working already..."
PILLS HERE!?
the wilder the sea, the better I feel
....
/me disappears.
10Grabbin peels?
6looooool
PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELS
6anyone remember beanie babies?
err - what?
6those two are my favs ^^
6beanie babies
6they were a series of small plushes with plastic beads in them
6they were SO cute
I never got into them.
The creepy child at the end of their advertisements saying "Beanie Babies" in an extremely low voice got me out of it.
I've NEVER seen them before :P
6yeah alot of people didn't
6I never saw ads actually
And there weren't enuff birds.
6I got my first one in a hallmark store, and then went back regularly for more
6I've got a cardinal, robin, blue jay, eagle, parrot, turkey
They were rather expensive and I already had plushies.
6...
/me 6goes to look what else
Pocket-sized
Filled with...well, bean-like stuff for stuffing
Hence their name
6pelican and two owls
6yeah, my Magic one (the white dragon in that pic) went for about $50
6and bah
6I was gonna do homework before class
6oh well
...

Who's Guest?
Oh, it's Blue, nevermind.

5Squawk
Hm.
14Neigh.

12Gotta cook dinner!
Hello there, little sister.
14:O Hi RDX.
5Hai thur
07ra
sup
07i am not good at predicting rain o3o
12I use wood peadges to predict rain XD
07lol
12I noticed that whenever it's gonna rain, wood peadges sit on lamposts with their necks tucked in and all poofed out
07I actually haven't seen pidgeons around campus at all o3o
don't you get them baked or roasted or such?
12LOL
07lol
what?
did I say something funny?
07nope.
07and that's why it's funny
07=3
12Yeh, everyone's always making jokes about me eating wood peadges whenever I mention them
03Sleeping in FTW?
People say that cows sit down when it's about to rain, but they only ever seem to sit down just after it starts raining, so they're not much help.
oO
Lol cows.
07free newspapers make good umbrellas XP
/me recalls the story about the cow and the Sea of Japan. That was an awesome story.
Soup.
14xD
reminds me of one thing: Why can't cows swim?
well, they can't keep the rear "exit" closed. This way, they just run full of water and sink...
LOL
I'm serious
12No no they can swim
12http://johnochwat.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/swimming_cow1.gif
that cow's not swimming, but standing with its hooves on the ground
12It's not, can't you see the swim trail? XD
03Photoshop FTW?
trust me on this Arti - I know enough farmers from the netherlands and other flood regions
12Cows do swim, there have been reports of them jumping into the water and escaping from farmers
12http://www.flickr.com/photos/91944832@N00/56906671/
12Tell me, why could a cow NOT swim?
12I mean mammals even
hrm - took a closer look on an information page. Looks like it really was just an april joke about the cow's physiology
12What info page?
12This is flickr
12It's people uploading their personal photos
I was looking on the web for some additional information Arti :P
as I said: I'm a multitasker :P
12Ok, but they do
12Cows do swim
yeah, yeah
03Haha, so here's what I'm writing
03the university is making me do pkart 2 of a mandatory "Alcohol education" class online
12Hai Lugia ^v^
03so it goes "List some thoughts here"
03I completely forgot about this class, and now the university is forcing me to waste MORE time completing more of it... UGH.
03I don't drink, ever, and I don't appreciate all this mandatory crap that just makes me want to kill whoever designed the class.
03Hope that helps! :D
/me sits all over Lugia
Heya Arti ^v^
03I think that adaquetly describes it
/me dunks a bag of cookies over all over Kyu
and how might you be Arti? ^v^
/me dances
wow - they just showed a kitchen on television...200,000 euros expensive oO
Outch...
yeah
but that kitchen really had everything I'd KILL for in fact^^
07lol
a convectomat, induction oven, wine cooler, an even bigger refrigerator with FIVE different temperature zones...
07o.-.o
5Pie.
well, one would expect that when the kitchen costs more then most homes... lol
12I really want a big fridge L>
12*:>

07how'd the kirby theme in Brawl get stuck in my head if I haven't played in months? O.-.o

07o3o
What you watching?
07Fairy Tail
07it's pretty recent
07although the manga has been around a while
Cool.
Hey.
hello
07arf.
as I've talked to a friend of mine - can anyone here explain me why some girls can talk more than half an hour without SAYING ANYTHING at all?
10o-O
07XD
I mean - this particular girl...her communication is around 97% redundant!
07it's a game
what kind of game?
stand my talking as long as you can without shooting yourself?
07they test your patience by boring you to death
10There's words scattered around. Gather them and they form a single sentence!
07then if you lose they're free to get mad at you XD
don't worry - I'm mad at her already
07LOL
and I've just switched my ears to passthrough
07now just nod or say uh-huh every few minutes and you win
07unless they ask you "what did I just say?"
/me flees
why say that yourself if you can add a generator to do so for you?
07lol
in this case - just look at her, smile and say "oh baby, you really look gorgeous!
10That's a cheat code.
I just make an adrogynous noise.
07then again that could backfire if they aren't feeling pretty that day XP
that's how you beat the system
10!!
I find it amazing how my sister can phone someone to tell them something, then only end up actually getting to that point 30 minutes into the conversation.
07and if you really want to impress them, remember a single irrelevant story and bring it up the next day
07XD
07good thing the girls are all idle so we don't get yelled at
/me shot
14Is Articuno on?
07as far as I know
07maybe.
14owo
07better o3o
10o_O

4Heya
Hey.
4I was happy just now and now I've been made stressed, hate it when people do that.
hi

Ah.
4Hi

no i really am new...
^ I did that to some people once.
ew there is a spider on my wall 1 sec gotta kill it
4Someone who is meant to be on MY SIDE is debating with me on facebook. I don't do debates.
4Ok.
I like debates. :P
me 2
4I don't, it makes me stressed and upset.
4I try to avoid them lol.
ha! spider is dead!
4It's because people make personal comments during debates and they are not meant to in a fair debate.
4Yet, a lot of people I know do it...
Spiders eat mosquitoes, therefore I like spiders.
4I hate spiders too, I can't catch them with a paper and glass, too terrified, dunno why.
4They crawl on your face when you're asleep too.
...
ahhh afraid
4And make webs for you to walk in to and scare the living daylights out of people.
12lol
12living daylights
12now about the living nightlights?
4I used to scream at the sight of spiders...now I just go 'URGGHHHH' like a little kid, can't help it.
12i just get scared and kill them
12if it is a big spider, theni have someone else kill it
4I hate big spiders worse than little spiders, dunno why.
My friend hates spiders.
Which is why I have decided that sooner or later, I need to get a tarantula.
12lol
4I'm terrified of those.
4Do you want to give your friend a heart attack haha.
Well, not in a literal sense.
4I didn't mean that either.
12yay i am going to battle primal dialga

/me rolls his eyes at blissey's bro

12he has no fever
4Then again, the trick is to put hot tea in your mouth when they do it...
10lol
12just feels like he is going to *throw up*
12guess what was the first thing he did when he came home?
4Well, ask him if he wants some chocolate
4if he says yes, he isn't sick
what?
12grabbed his ds so he could play it
12arrg
4not ill then
4When I'm ill, I'm too sick even to watch tv
12no me, with the 101 fever, is told i cant have mine at all

12yeah, i think so

yeeeeah
Remember meh?
12yesssssss
ffff
/me runs away
12whyyyy
12how you do that?
type /me
4lol, my dog's snoring and is cuddled up in a dressing gown that's on the sofa
/me 12chases Flame lugia
12ty
>_> annoying drving missions brb
morning Alex
12woah.. that was good graphics in sky.. i luv it!
12it showed chatot looking up to see the bosses of brine cave on the celing
12sweet!!!!
14XD
12whats a dressing gown?
6i hate those. x.=.x
12umm..
12bathrobes?
12possibly?
6I just managed to egt the Pagani Zonda LM race car from those missions.
07LOL
07Dressing
6it was worth it.
07as in the stuff you have on food
well
4Maybe it is called a housecoat? I've heard that before.
14:O
"Oh, it's big. Oh, we don't understand it. OH! LET'S KILL IT!"
14Is there different types of races in GT4?
>_> thats what i am getting owned in
Yeah >:D *grabs a shotgun*
Jk o-o
/me hide
07Mreh =/
Wolves are epik o3o
just own this 1 by half a second was easy though despite starting the race 90 seconds after 1st >_>
4A pack of wolves that took a really long time to settle into the Yellowstone National Park for years, and many people worked on it - they have all been shot dead this week. Same with many other packs. If they carry on they'll go extinct.
12i luv my partner she makes all the bosses confused and i win!!!!
14xD
4But hey, people like that don't care.
07I'm for regulation of wolves, and if they do become a problem, I porpose you move them.
07Not shoot them
07>.>
07there are ways of just moving them too, without doing that...
lets see the freaking 24 hour races >_>
07because they should NOT all be wiped out!
4Yeah, I mean I don't want them kill people or their livestock but they moved them to Yellowstone and now killed them there.
maybe a ranger should just shoot those people for a change
07Why?
had to do 1 of those to win the formula 1 car
14o.o
12*howls*
4I believe in some parts of southern Africa, rangers are allowed to shoot blanks at poachers.
/me 12runs from wolves
12ahh
yeah, regulation. But they need their environment
/me pets the wolves
12ha ha i beat the brine cave ppl
07That's why it's so tricky
lol i'm surprised my brothers ps2 didn't overheat during that race years ago
14LOL!
4Same with foxes here, we made wolves and lynxes extinct here and the fox will go the same way if they don't be careful.
She completely ignored me when I explained that pretty much everything she'd said was wrong.
I luv how blissey is like having a convo with her/himself
there's enough space in the world to SHARE, if people just would adapt
X_X still have to do 2 more of those races
14o.o
4Yeah, but wolves -were- here before us, it's us that have intruded on their land not the other way round.
NOT!A SINGLE! HUMAN! was killed by wolves ever!
12o.o
12aww wigglytuff is sooo cute when he cries
12save he wolves
same with white sharks...
6Is it the Skyline one?
4I suppose sometimes it's like spiders, they get killed cos people are scared.
people are afraid of sharks - especially the white one's
a~a
12if we kill off the wolves again, itl just be a vicious circle
sharks have killed people
well - around 80 people are killed every year by sharks...
good timin
...but...around 130 people are trampled to death by elephants per year!
ugh dont think so wait is there a skyline 24 hour 1 o_O
4you know what the most dangerous creature in the world is?
4People.
homo sapiens
than shoot the elephants >:D
humanity.
Jk
6no
once againm
6i ment the Slipstream Mission.
6>> since that is what you're doing.
07I'm guilty of killing millipedes
07these scare the living daylights out of me
Hippopotami kill the most in Africa.
07But other than that, I try to leave stuff alone
Excluding people.
i haet spiders ._.
I kill em cuz they scare me ._.
oh those were annoying but finished those recently
/me shoots him
we are also one of the few self-destructive species on Earth, if not the only one
i know o3o
6did you get the Zonda LM?
/me runs
Yay
12hi kyu
/me shot and explodes
4If I wasn't scared of spiders I wouldn't kill them, I don't want to kill them and I'm not happy about it. I did have a spider catcher but it broke.
4I'll get a new one.
the 2 circuit de la sarthe 24H races i have to do >_>
4Just, if I don't, they'll crawl in my bed and stuff....probably unlikely but it's what I keep thinking.
6ah.
6those suck
07meh, spiders that get stuck indoors are pretty much gonna die anyways
Lemmings?
4I thought they ate flies and stuff?
07so i don't go through the trouble of releasing them lol
6Get in first and leave it on 3x speed, the rest you leave on while you sleep.
4Spiders that my mum releases come back in >>
/me highfives Kyu
24H nurburing or what ever that freakishly long track is called
I has a question
4I wish spiders were much bigger, like dog sized, then I wouldn't dream of it
too bad it goes back to x1 when theres a pit x_x
10o_O
6Norsheliefe or whatever
6I beat it with the Toyota Monolia car
4I think there are some in the middle east like that.
6smoked. XD
If u guys could completely wipe out a species and have NO negative effects caused by it, what species would u kill? (id kill mosquitoes)
4I meant little dog sized. Not massive.
dont remember what i used to beat it but it was way to easy
4I probably would pick spiders but then we would drown in flies.
i think u thinking of camel spidahs
4I think that's what frogs are for though.
Camel spiders aren't actually that big.
They are exaggerated.
4I saw that hoax email yeah.
6got the yellow/black Foruma one
frogs, bats, carnivourous plants
have the blue 1
eat flys
4I like those 'flying fox' bats, so cute.
07if only there were cute mammals that ate bugs o3o
6I wanted the Mobil one. T.=.T
4Meerkats
/me points at little kids
07like...ones we can legally have as pets lol
4He said cute
10LOL
lol go use it in arcade then ol
Oh snap
lol
4My dog eats bugs
07and not just bugs on the ground o3o
lol
6I did
07ones that could get flies lol
6alot

6there should be. x3
/me fires his lazor
/me puts Kyu in a barrel and rolls him down a hill
4Wheeeeee!

4Dragons eat fire
they better have a speed MUCH higher than x3 then
4Nom nom nom
10So... do they drink napalm?
kyu r dragon?
6They better damn well have the New Pagani supercars or the newest Viper.
07yush
Ffffff
4Yes, thanks for that correction
k
4lol
/me dumps water down the hill
4I think napalm is like soda to a dragon
6technicly there was a 5x speed but it was removed from GT4
10What about magma oO
4That right, Kyu?
10DECISIONS
Apparently goliath spiders can grow to be 30cm long.
Ahhhhhh!

4Magma is milkshake for dragons

7Yeah.
10Seeya later then, Altair

The only adverse trasit Vulcan has is that he seems to believe he's a dragon.
*trait
o//
/whois drf
7I'm still proud of when I made flamey have the nervous breakdown.

adzman upped it tho
hi
ugh
that's one series I won't buy, since they overprice it
10Lugia and Ho-Oh's battle music for one thing was an entire let down
4oka then
think about me slapping the developers in the rhythm of the pokeballs being restored in the pokemon center
:)
I think
03eh
03remixes ftw though
.............. loss by less than .1 >_>
6ouch.
12They've not remixed, they've somehow managed to change the tune in a lot of them
03o.o
03I didn't mind FR/LG's music
12Ho-oh's music is good, but not good enough.. nothing like the Ruby/Sapphire legend music.. or even Suicune's from Crystal
*slap-slap-slap-slap-slap-slap-bang-splash-baga-splash*

10If only Nintendo accepted some of the talented people's remixes instead of making the old G/S/C music worse
ok do what u did but try to go faster in 1 of the corners u felt comfortable at

12Lugia's theme. Totally NOT Lugia at all.....
*cough* who cares about Ho-oh Arti?^^
oO
12Sounds more like some random Pokemon music in the anime
okay...
12I like Ho-oh
12D:
6What track is it you're working on?
4im so confused

12They make lugia sound evil...?
12I think that sums it up pretty much
6Talking about Gran Turismo 4, Shadow.
/me 14shifts back to his normal form.
So you can shapeshift now?
Lol.
14No. o.=.o
12I have to go in a sec :>
"Vulcan shifts back to his normal form."
12Thoughts appreciated
?
this song....
I'll have to talk with someone at nintendo....DEFINATELY
12>v> good
14Ever since Basil shoved that Crystal down my throat in that one RP with him i've been doing this from time to time without me wanting it.
12Lugia deserved dramatic, slow paced but powerful sounding music
>_> -.048 ok now i am ticked
LOL
2good evening everyone
12Not this Team Rocket style crap
yeah, and NOT something like "look - a random, evil Pokemon"
12I have to go :(
dont give up
2take care Arti!
03LOL bye
12Seeya tomorrow.
what about a battle remix of Lugia's song from the movie?
12.bai Arti~ :(
kkArti
14Sometimes the crystal Surges and I go into the Dark evil form for an amount of time.
I see.
I can't do that, of course
10It'd attract more of the old Pokemon fans as well
14But i mostly go dark whenever Basil comes about.
What would you all do if I told you I don't exist?
ok now if i lose by -.001 i am gonna be REALLY ticked
they should have asked me for an idea lol
10I will admit Ho-Oh's theme pwned Lugia's
i've lost by that many times online lol
14Then i would think that i'm crazy and run to the nearest Psychiatric Hospital.
Nintendo, I mean.
14X3
10but I was really looking forward to Lugia
10and Nintendo just ruined it for me and other Lugia fans :/
lol i use to lose lots of races in mario kart 64 by .01
12its just a game
I'm serious though.
10>_>
and I agree, Sky
epiclol
03yeah seriously Umbreon
yeah & its really bad when u lose to the guy talking trash to u
03it's just a game, people get too uptight over everything
14Tell me about it.
I claim neutrality
I do not and have never existed.
14Then how are you talking?
12there is many more things to get uptight about
I can type.
I'm just not real.
14You cant be a Figment of my Imagination cause There is Text. Text is hard to Halousinate.
Who's to say you're not hallucinating right now?
12like that F you got on your science test because for the question of "what is the atomic mass of gold?" you drew a lugia
14Cause I keep walking into the Objects i see today. x3
03LOL
That's irrelevant. This chatroom doesn't exist, Vulcan. I'm trying to prove that.
10Lolwhut
14Pfft, you're trying to Make my Brain flow loosely out of my Ears in a Soupy-like Manor.
14It aint going to work.
14x3
10We're not allowed doing art in science class
I promise - if Nintendo ruins Lugia in Movie 13 like they did with the theme in the game, I will throw my Wii out of the window and curse Nintendo to burn in the lowest circles of hell
0.0 +0.35 dang that was too freaking close!
12speaking of gold drf
12http://engrishfunny.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/engrish-funny-hot-gold.jpg
+0.035***
14x3 i see.
03LOL
good u passed
In fact, we all are.
barely lol
14Pfft
14Riiiight
I'm the part of you that wants to wake up.
12yeah if that was the settings i would switch it to gold as well
12o.o
12and set the speed to 3
Given a more tangible form, that is.
03alchemy ftw?
14I thought i was awake. o.=.o
14Or...>.=.>
Thought, exactly. You're dreaming while awake.
Or should I say /we/ are.
12makes sense, curse the corp that was responsible for the creation of lugia
14Impossible?
In reality, yes. But we're far from reality in here.
14True.
lol X3
12i doubt this place would be like this if nintendo didn't make a lugia
12it would probably be TST
12the sky temple of ditto and eevee
...
Another part of you, though, wants to maintain this ruse.
gah
07lol
Whatever you do, don't listen to it.
a piece of jelly and an unstable, uber-cute, ridiculus kidfox...
07Oh?
07you talking about me? o3o
/me hides
07rora
I bought explorers of the sky o3o
2hey Aurora
14K, got it.
14x3
you're a piece of jelly, Kyu?
/me hops onto Aurora :3
Given you stay on the correct pathway you'll return to life as you once knew it, in time.
XDDD
/me 6floofs on contact
by the way my time was 2:15:203 2nd place 2:15:238
07nu, i'm the unstable ubercute, ridiculous fox, TS
07XP
12cool Aurora~
not bad
12<late-ish>
/me takes any trace of Eevee, throws it hign in the air and teporal-aeroblasts it to Pluto
I vote this as most interesting and most epic discussion talked about on TST ever
12lolwut
12true they might be messing with lugia's reputation but the truth is that it could of been much worse
6seeing as I came in late
either way if it was temple of Lugia and Articuno or Ditto and Eevee
6anyone wanna fill me in?
12they didn't have to make remakes of the gold and silver games at all
I'd still be called Nick
...
anyone wanna fill you in what?
how lame
12they didn't have to make a new lugia and ho-oh movie
6 14:25	Nick	I vote this as most interesting and most epic discussion talked about on TST ever <-discission on what?
on Which is better, Bananas, or oranges
nah I kid you :P
6I had a frozen banana treat this morning
12bananas
2Banana
/me goes some
/me hides
its about the new vs lugia music in SS or something along those lines
6it was frozen bananas....crushed to the consistancy of ice cream
12i'm the biggest hypocrite you guys will ever meet :D
then about what happened if Lugia was never created and this chat wouldnt exist
12it might :\
6looooooooooool
12just as Articuno, then XD
4my head
12dunno
12even though her nick is Articuno
12she still claims that Lugia is her favorite pokemon
6read that as dundun
6like
12and it would seem very hard to make just a website off of Articuno
6DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
anything bad with that Umbreon?
12i mean articuno has only been in 2 episodes and 1 movie
ok nintendo have fun & if u have any questions on GT4 PM me later bro
12and that was hard enough
ok
may I add a quote from one of my favourite science fiction figures?
There comes a time when you look into the mirror, and you realize that what you see is all that you will ever be. Then you accept it, or you kill yourself. Or you stop looking into mirrors.
12lol
07Hmm
07I'll stop looking into mirrors kthnxbai
07o3o
07anyway
07im gonna drag my body off to nest

07hate
07HATE
07the letter x
07it fails
07in so many ways
12lolz
and another, VERY funny quote from the same person:
Londo Mollari: But this…this, this, this is like… being nibbled to death by, uh…Pah! What are those Earth creatures called? Feathers, long bill, webbed feet…go "quack".
Vir Cotto: Cats.
Londo: Cats! I'm being nibbled to death by cats.
12x-x;
/me hides
07LOL!
12o-O
12kyu nibbled on me irl D:

07arharh
/me snugs Umbreon
07Umbry~~~
/me snugs sis back
12btw kyu
12it's come to my attention that Jirachi is an interesting lead
07hm
12o.o
12Iron Head's suicide leads and makes them have a 60% chance of flinch
12it can trick slower leads
12lay out stealth rock or u-turn
12if magnezone decides to lock you
this here is also lovely:
Ivanova: Lennier, get us the hell out of here!
Lennier: Initiating "getting the hell out of here" maneuver.
12actually for september shoddybattle stats showed that jirachi was the 3rd most popular lead
6looooooool
4chats going to get dead
12sadly scizor is still the number 1 pokemon overall though
yep so back to gt4
12wb Sky~
12lol what
12smeargle start~~~
and lastly - the longest quote
[A reporter complains to Sheridan about Ivanova's rough treatment.]
John Sheridan: Commander! Did you threaten to grab this man by the collar and threaten to throw him out an airlock?
Sheridan: I'm shocked! Shocked and dismayed.
[The reporter nods, mollified.]
Sheridan: May I remind you that we are short on supplies here? We can't afford to take perfectly good clothing and throw it out into space! Always take the jacket off first—I've told you that before!
Sheridan: Sorry. She meant to say, "stripped naked and thrown out of an airlock". I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

6it S00PAH jumps
^ yeah.
12...
8's already out
6Bah, I wish Arti was around./
But the first is 8, so 8 doesn't correspond to the number of tge game.
6I wanted to tell her that she has over 200k views on dA and that 'pidgeon' was a correct spelling of the bird in the past. Ovo
It is the number of chars I think.
6Thanks for the hug, Char.
no 8 is 1 of 10 mario party games available
6pidgeon
it's np
6is the correct spelling
6It's archaeic, right?
...On what platforms?
6apparently it evolved to pigeon, but I still say pidgeon
6most will spell pigeon, but I do know of a few who will spell pidgeon
pidgeon looks correct to me
6whether that's due to actual knowledge or just spelling based on pronunciation, I don't knpow
6know
and i have a program with the name pidgin. :3

2o3o yeah
03EW MACINTR
03ASH
6lol
6I was waiting for that
031. Install a real OS, such as Windows
032. Windows Sound recorder
03Enough said.
2o-o
2uhh
12ubuntu better
2Macintrash?
2o-o
03LOL
03Yes./
03or crApple, whichever you prefer
2o-o
6well, everyone has preferences
03And most people own a hammer.
03It just depends how you want to use what you have...
6exactly
03hammer --> Mac --> Spare parts :D
Roara!
6many people who prefer arts happen to choose Apple
/me splodehugs
03Why, though?
03Name, like, any program for a Mac
03and I can name one equal or better for Windows.
6dunno lol
03That's my point.
03People go "zomfg Final cut Pro"
2XD
03Stupid morons, it's called Corel Video Studio, nough said
/me 6stomps on Corel
6stupid corel painter
03and Adobe whatever is for Windows too, as much as they ARE bloated
2o-o
03Illustrator or w/e, apparently people use that?
2uh
2Pages?
03what's Pages?
2 /Applications/iWork '08/Pages.app
03I just like the quote, "People who buy Macs tend to have more money than brains"
2pfff that's not right
2drf
03but what IS tha tprogram
03like what's it do?
03What
2please stop insulting my school
2>.>
6built in webcam!
/me 6runs
O_o
03My laptop has a built in webcam
6dunno first thought that came to mind
2I don't care if they're all insanely rich/stupid and many of them like macs
03LOL
03I mean, you can run Windows on a Mac
2there's still an equal amount who enjoy pcs
2:|
03exactly
2Parrallels
03College is annoying, it seems like half the people have MacBooks
03I was thinking more Bootcamp
2:|
http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1934063/ yoshi's cute :3
2Maybe because they like it?
12sounds more like applecamp
6bootcamp is the program that allows windows programs onto mac, right?
Either a Mac or PC is a good computer, it depends on what you want. O_o
2exactly
03nah, because in reality mac usere make up only like 5% of the computing popularion
03*population
2:|
03No. BootCamp is the thing that lets you install windows on Mac hardware
03and actually... you know... boot it
12only because they are more expensive drf
12only because of that
2>.>
03I want to try something, too, using BootCamp to install Windows, then using Windows to erase OSX :)
03well not only are they more expensive, they'r enot worth it
03Like, you look at the hardware on a $1500 Macbook
12i think they make awesome systems
03and you can equal or greater it on a $600 normal laptop
12but their OS is all about preference
03Mine cost $1700, but you can't get ANY Mac that has the insane power of this thing
03OSX is for people who don't want to LEARN
03who just want to click buttons
03and do all of two features
6drf, what is it you have?
6MSI?
03MSI is the company, yes
12drf
03I have Windows 7
03on MSI hardware
03what
12apple is great media editing
12:(
03No, though
03Corel VideoStudio >= Final Cut Pro or w/e
2:|
12i doubt you're going to agree though
03and garageband, meh, ever heard of Audacity?
12and going to claim that you're the best media editing software alive
03I dunno, I walked into an Apple store th eother day, opened www.anti-apple.com on one Mac, and www.zune.net on another
03The third was broken./
roara explorers of sky? :3
2yes
2XD
6yes
03that's the other thing too, the myth that Macs don't crash as much as Windows
03because they do, I've seen it too many times.
2:|
can I call you Roara the explorer?
2nope
12i've seen it once
03They just don't have bluescreens, instead they either don't turn on or freeze
2I've never had a mac crash on me
12only once
2'cept when the hard drive disconnected XD
/me brick'd
03I've seen it more than I've seen crashed PCs, here
03they have an even number of Macs and PCs
2lol then your luck stinks XD
/me installs the happytime virus in drf's computer
03and the PCs almost never break, even though they ARE Vistrash
03o.o
/me uses Malwarebytes to get prid of it
03-p
2XD
03"You can't get viruses on a Mac... because nobody uses them"
12you'll never see it coming drf
03o.o
03yeah I will
2:|
12i'll send you an email with the topic "if you want to get swine flu, click this email"
03if the computer all the sudden starts acting slower than normal I know it's a virus
/me 2kicks drf
12then you click it and you get the happytime virus instead
2*sigh*
03LOL
03why would I click that?
12lol
12curiousity?
2because you want to stay home from school
03I'm in college
03it doens't work that
03*work that way
2:P
O_o
03Whatever. The thing is... in the real world... typically studios like Pixar and whatever, they don't use ANY real OS... they have their own machines
03Like, have you ever seen the making of for movies?
03The computers they use clearly aren't either Mac or Windows, they're something entirely different
6I know already that pixar has their own programs
03yeah
03so the arguement about video editing is invalid
03as real studios don't use EITHER
6meeting the power of their stuff is near impossible
6so lets not go there
03well, I mean any movie company
bye Llotz
03like even live action movies
Night guys
6night
ninis
I have to go now too actually

2XD
2I have, like...
6i still LOVE that story of how I got it
2 3 of 2 different movie cards
03I never *got* the cards
03I have a few from back in the day but never understood how they worked
6lol
12i am so irritated how SP decks
03I just play the games, and watch the vintage show
12they take all the fun out of the format
6my friends and I back in my old school had our own way of doing things
2o-o
03I just stole all the cards
6prize cards were used differently
2LOL
03like "I don't have any Pokémon cards, have any you don't want?"
2@ Roara
03and then I'd tell that to everyone
03and get tons
2XD
6while you place prize cards from YOUR deck, if your opponent beats you and gets to draw a prize, they draw it from your prizes. And kept it
6it was all a game of keepsies

10you basically have to buy a small tower of CD's today
...and you needed more than one hour to burn one...within a CD burner as large as a VHS recorder.......at a price of around 15,000dollars
1015 000 dollars
10what
for a cd burner in these days
10all i can say is "lol, technology"
10and "Thanks for Moores Law"
and - as I said: One CD needed around one hour and fifteen minutes to complete
10oh my... today clearly more MASSIVE amounts of data is transferred almost instantly...
and today? 5 minutes a max....
10but burning takes some time yeah
10but even then, lol
hey, you could have grabbed a gigabyte harddisk then...for two- or three thousand dollars....
the price was around 3 dollars per megabyte
02:O
today....it's six cent - per GIGABYTE!
02LOL
02wow
and people still think SSDs were expensive :P
a 256GB solid-state-disk is around 400 dollars......
02xD
02really?
yeah
02it's 1TB for around $200 here
if you want a fast one
02ah well
02it's still fast
/me shrugs
I'm talking about ssd harddisks
02ah
10heh

The same risk is reported for cats as well, although cats are less likely to ingest sweet food, having no sweet taste receptors. Complications include digestive issues, dehydration, excitability, and a slow heart rate. Later stages of theobromine poisoning include epileptic-like seizures and death. If caught early on, theobromine poisoning is treatable. Although not usual, the effects of theobromine poisoning, as stated, can become

12?
12Ovo
thx again
12I left my mobile on IRC?
hi Arti
you left and you seemed not to respond at all oO
12What time did I connect from mobile?
...and I was almost falling into depression because of it already x_X
12v_v
(20:00:54) (~Articuno) Gotta go v______________v
(20:05:45) • Articuno (Articuno@articuno.articuno.articuno.articuno) has left IRC (Quit: <Lugia> I might have a connection at the place we are staying, but it is... prepare yourself... a 18kbps line)
12But that wasn't from my mobile
12O_____o
12What the hell?
(20:51:48) • Articuno (mobilearti@212.183.140.49) has left IRC (Ping timeout)
12I didn't even connect as far as I knew lol..
12My phone was in my pocket since I got out of work
hmm...maybe your phone was feeling lonely
^^
12Did you want me for anything while I was pinging in and out? XD
nothing specific in fact, no
12k
12well I didn't win that Lugia figure I was on about....
12I was so broken up about that >v>
12But I was out.. couldn't do anything about that
did you know there're SIX different power cord pin designs in the world for ordinary hardware?
gah...
12Actually no I didn't know that
/me snores all over Arti
I got them all here - in just one adapter now....and I'll be bringig it with me to england
12That reminds me
12Gotta find you a hotel!
would be better, yeah. It's a bit too cold for camping now
12Ahhh!
12City Inn (the fancy place) costs like £80 a night!
12Don't worry I'm just looking around ^^
12Ah, two nights = £120, not that bad but still a lot!
it'll be in about a month Ecco
not too much in fact Arti. What rating does it have and how far is it away?
12It's in the city center, so about 15 min walk from us
12Right beside the railway station
12Infact it's practically on top XD
12and let me check rating
12I think it's 4 but I'll check
that's quite good, yeah
hrrm - let me take a look if I get any corporate special offers
12Can't find it -v-
!greet off
12LOL
4oops

4I clicked on connect too fast before setting mah nickname xD
03that's why mIRC FTW
4That's what I'm using.
you'd LOVE the InterCity hotels in germany here Arti btw. :P
03o.o
03you only need to set your name once
03startup scripts FTW?
they're directly at the train stations. Free WLAN and a direct look to the train tracks - but still far enough away so don't hear a thing
4I don't understand stuff like that :P
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8316077.stm
4Too complicated :P blah
4Thanks though
03just replace that with yours LOL
4I prefer just settings and stuff rather than scripts which make no sense to me.
4lol ok ^^
12http://www.cityinn.com/
12The first two images shown on the front page flash are the Leeds hotel :3
hmm - looks nice
4lol BF
!greet off
12First one, even
wooow - that really looks modern
12Modern is City Inn's style :>
4Dinner's nearly ready but I eat at the computer these days anyway haha, only when my mum isn't in.
03LOL, the place I stayed in London FTW but I think it's really expensive
4Nice ^^
12You stayed in City Inn?!

12Lame D: they're not answering
4Maybe they fell asleep on the job xD
maybe
12You know what's funny, all the cities listed at the top of the City Inn site are the scum of the Earth except for Leeds LOL
4if you're gonna fall asleep on the job, at least sleep under the desk - the worker's motto.
oh?
4lol
London is not THAT bad. Well - at lest from the memory I have of it
12Especially Manchester and Birmingham >v>
12Central London isn't, the rest is
what about Bristol?
4hmm, accidently ate a cold bean then and didn't realise it tasted ok cold
12Bristol is absolute trash, even the center
12It's where I met Xai though
12LOL
sounds like Frankfurt :P
i was watching some Panorama show about Bristol earlier
4Been to Manchester, it's great, seen pictures of Birmingham and Bristol, it's good, but I suppose photos lie
12Manchester is awful.
4They MAKE them look good to trick you
4I thought Manchester was good but I was new I guess to it.
12Oh and not forgetting KNOTTINGHAM
12Don't EVER go there
12Ever
12Ever
err?
4Why don't you like those cities? Just curious? All UK cities are uglu.
4ugly*
12Did I even spell it right? XD
why should I? I'm not Robin Hood :P
12LOL
4lol it's Nottingham
12RN, Manchester because it's the capital city for gang crime
4So is everywhere else.
12Nottingham because it's the capital city for gun crime
12No
12Not true
12Manchester has seperate laws because of it's gang crime
4Everywhere has guns, drugs and crime....most cities anyway. But I guess they must have more.
In other places it's mainly stabbings, so much better. :D
03LOL, detroit FTW?
12Omg if you think Manchester is just the same as any other.. lol
4We get shootings all the time here, it's NORMAL.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
12Yes because people rarely die from stabbings!
hey, I've grown up in a neighbourhood between polands, turks, russians and albans - if one of them can harm me, they really deserve it!
12time to move to an amish city :P
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
4Gangsters are just people too lazy to get jobs at the end of the day.
12amish crime
Gangsters are chavs with guns. XD
4Amish crime = I stole your apples
12Birmingham and Bristol aren't that bad for crime but they are just so trashy and full of idiots
like most places :P
12and no RN, not in Manchester
!greet off
12In Manchester, gangsters are 6 year olds without proper parenting.
you should make a LONG bow around Berlin then^^
4Well, if they got jobs they wouldn't be in gangs, is what I meant.
4Ah, well, it's all down to poverty at the end of the day I guess.
I liked berlin
Hm
12go to chicago -.-
12Yeh and Manchester is a crap hole
Hi all
4I like the look of Berlin Zoo.
best city ever is Newcastle-upon-Tyne
4Fair enough, I only went once with school so we went to all the good parts Arti.
12No way, Leeds, then perhaps Newcastle
4Newcastle, I worked there and I liked it.
I bet you've not been to Berlin Kreuzberg or Berlin Neukölln, eh?
12There are good parts of Manchester? LOOOOOL
XD
!greet off

4Well the museums and things they take the schoolkids to.

XD
03LOL at Judge Alex
since they have a uni that's easy to get into there
03there are the funniest cases ever
For those that don't know
12You know it's a well known thing that people of Yorkshire think Leeds is posh lol
those two are the parts of the city you should only pass with the gas pedal nailed to the ground, not stopping at any red traffic lights
Ish mah birfday today :3
12anyway, what's not posh about it?
12It has all the swish :>
4You're biased cos you live there lol.
What's up with those parts?
The name isn't posh. It doesn't sound posh.
12No we live here because we love leeds XD
We don't have that many Y's in german in fact :P
4If posh = very expensive then yeah.
12Otherwise we'd have lived in some place cheaper XD
I kept making SO many typos!!!
/me is ignored :P
Happy birthday. :P
4you're not ignored

12It suddenly changes pace
12Yeh it's just not Lugia at all
well, Arti, any wishes about what I can or should bring with me to england?
4it sounds more suited to a small evil pokemon yes.
12Your new Lugia plush? :D
Hm
Arti I don't think it fits Lugia
12Ho'
unless Lugia is the kind of thing to go on a rampage
12Ho-oh's is great though
And destroy things for no reason

03<Articuno> DRF if we hold one it'll be in Cali or Florida sorry <-- why? That's just fricking biased
/me runs
12Hiw>
12*How?
12Cali is where most of the TSTers are
03but it's actually SO much easier to get to Florida than to like England
12and yeh
12thats why Florida
12LOL
03I think there's a good deal in the east coast too
03why not in the middle somewhere?
Why not Las Vegas?
03Like, um, DC?
07who's in Florida though o3o
12Because the middle sucks
12lol
12Las Vegas is spensive.
03No it does't
07LOL VEGAS
03LOL
the hotels are cheap, the city is light and full of life
12Vegas is for adults
/me hides
07everyone in Cali is underage
lots of games, lots of arcades
03And Vegas is just gonna result in everyone losing their money
12No one's in Florida
12It's just easy to get to and cheap for us
03it's not cheap for ME
/me pokes New York
/me is shot
03and it's like a whole 2 day's drive
03if you had one in the middle somewhere I could drive t'here
07ew new york o3o

But I'll manage
4Everything I go through an airport they make me take my belt, coat and shoes off but no one else
Nah, they ask for your credit card details, always. O_o
argh airports
12Suicune's theme is worse than Lugia's by the way :/
you even have to register 72 hours prior departure via internet so you're allowed to fly there
Ew :/
07you should plan the TST meets around the time Nintendo hosts the national Pokemon tournaments XP
03LOL getting uptight over music
4I still think of the word sweetcorn when suicune is mentioned
07whenever that'll be lol

12Yay Raikou's theme sounds more like the original than Suicune's..
well, I kinda liked Las Vegas. Not because of the Casinos, but the atmosphere
14Hey, Artil.

4I've made and ate mine, microwaves on weeknights ftw
07if only it were warmer
Because Canadia is Kyu
he asks the man: "Why are you drinking?" The man answers: "To forget!" "To forget what?" "To forget I'm drinking."
4we're further up than Canada sort of, yet aren't more cold because of the gulf stream.
O_o LOL
4I liked the talking bird.
07RN
07it's Canadia
/me hides
lol
I am going to die when going to canada
im not used to cold
z.z
so yeah
I
4And the theme tune of the cartoon 'perhaps one day he'll come your way' and I was certain I would meet him one day lol.
'll ne all
brrr
then die
and then ya
bai bai hawk
07wait whut
the end
4That's what coats are for
07I thought it was cold where you lived
07o3o
Kyu nope
07also
07I forgot where you live
I'm by the coast and the gulf stream makes it so that it rarely ever gets below freezing point
AND
/me runs
4It's freezing here at the moment and I had to go and get the dog in bare feet -_-
there is never snow here
never ever z.z
4We got snow in April in 2008
ugh
llol
anywya
4Never had snow at easter before, it was interesting
07that is why you leave slippers near the door
07XP
Im abit concerned
and LOL Kyu
07fuzzy bunneh slippers!
4Thanks for reminding me
12Im sorry guys I need to clean up and a load of other stuff -v-
4Magic it!!
12I'll be back much later
Ok Arti, cya later
/me magics it
12Ovo
4If only we could do that in real life.
Indeed lol
2see ya Arti
bai Arti D:
4watching '7 days on the breadline' now, watching people see what real life is like for some people instead of being moneybags
4lol
12so kyu
07arf
4He's so Kyu
12i don't suppose you know a way to get a jirachi without cheating do you?
12or making someone else cheat for you
03I know how to
4you eat the DS
12and having the pokemon colosseum bonus disk
4</insane>
03I have that bonus disc.
03you need one?
12yeah
03Hgm.
03*Hm.
03Um, well
03I'm not gonna use the disc for a while
03I could like... mail it to you
03if you send it back :o
03the problem is you can only get one per game, and I already got one in my Ruby/Sapphire (I don't think it works with emerald)
12you could restart ruby/sapphire :P
03yeah but that's too much work./
12-.-
03I COULD dump the save file from mine, start it over, get one, then migrate it, then put the save bakc
03*back
03problem, though, I don't have a GBA with me, just my DS Lite and DSi.
12sad
03so you want me to send you the thing, or what?
12i'd rather not
03hm
03well if you can wait a while I can get my GBA when I go home this weekend
12i'm sure i can find someone with the bonus disk that is less lazy :P
Pff, you can make a legitimate event pokemon by editing the save data.
03yeah but that's HACKING
12i don't want to do that though
03And legality checkers ftw?
Legality checkers don't detect it?
12i mean sure i can do that
03if you make a Pokémon using Pokesav it'll show as hacked.
03The only way to NOT have it show as hacked is if you clone a pre-existing one.
03creating one from scratch, I'm pretty sure, will show as hacked.
Pff, I bet you I can make one it would not show as hacked.
07what do you want with a Jirachi anyways?
12fun?
12it's the new OU
/me tries to get Windows XP Mode re-instlaled
07i'd make one if it wasn't banned in the 2010 tournament lol
03since the Nintendo Wi-Fi connector simply doesn't work on Windows 7
03or 64-bit
03brb, I gotta restart
12still good to use out of tournament
EEEP!!
/me bites kyu's tail
/me tailslaps Beto with the other tail
X.x
12well kyu though i doubt we'll ever see eachother again lol
12there is like a 15% chance pokemon tcg nationals will be held at st louis again
12tcg players were complaining the video game tournament was taking up too much space
12which i find kind of funny
07lol
Yes?
/me feels left out
7You mean my presence is being requested? None summon me.
D:
12i dunno where else they would hold it though
12the only place in columbus we sort of got irritated with
12st louis i thought was an ideal location but apparently everyone else thought it wasn't that good
:P
But yes, you've been summoned. I guess that makes me None.
07lol
Lol.
12changing the location to new york city would be like telling the people responsible for the idea to hold the olympics in an amish town
7Sssh. Stop breaking out of character!
7*is reminded of that crazy-ass south park episode\8
:D
I wasn't aware I was in character, but alright.
12maybe people were complaining because there was pretty much no sign of a McDonalds anywhere lol
07personally i'd like it in different places each year XP
12you're only saying that for the hopes of it being closer XD
07nah lol
7well, None, whence doth thou summon me too, if thy have a claim to such power?
07I just like traveling XP
12ever watch the travel channel?
07nope lol
12gasp
12anyway speaking of McDonalds
12http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6380193/McFarthest-point-in-the-US-from-a-McDonalds.html
07lol saw it o3o
12i see
The reason I've called you all here is so that we may figure out what to do of this ever-growing epidemic of Peruvian panflute bands. According to recent studies there are approximately sixty-five panflute bands per square kilometer.

4I prefer to look round to remember what I want
an hi J
4Online I tend to buy way too much
12Other way round for me
12Which is why I prefer to do it in RL
12Because then I get EVERYTHING I WANT AND MORE XD
4lol ^^
bah!
12But anyway, any good grocery store should allow you to shop online Quil
12and they deliver
2but ummmm i live right by the foot hills to the mountains.... and on a good hill u can see denver.... so im guessing....... Maybe 50, 60ish miles
what do you do when you need to work, but the thing you need to work on stresses you out? <.<;
ugh
hi guys
4I like to do my clothes shopping while I'm in the store...dunno if they do that online
Everyone I know in CO lives near Denver :\

12Quil, remember you don't "need" to finish it
4car*
12You don't need to even work on it
12Realising that makes the stress go away

Wow
He needs to get help :\
2which now im just like....... ugh

Like...seriously
2id have to agree..........
I would at least knock some sense into him :\
He's disobeying the basic laws of LIFE
2>.=.< i have to counsle like this every day.........
2Thats the thing about him, he doesnt know how to date or anything.....
Then he needs to take a step back from everything
Like I did
Fleh
And not worry about dating or serious relationships, worry about friends
That's it
Alright
/list
2his mother supposidly diss owned him when he realized he wasnt straight but lived there with an abbusive father, and every bf he got has laid him numberus times and left him with a broken heart....
yeah
2*face plantes into the desk again*
He needs to step back and get a grip on reality before he does anything
:\
Does he get online ever?
2some times...... he had a laptop and when his mom kicked him out idk if she kept that.....
Hmmm
Also: how old is he o.O and on the same note, you?
2what makes this all the more difficult for me is because of all the crap he has gone threw he goes threw emotional waves of depression that his life will always be this fucked up and will never get better.....
hahahahahha
2he is 18
2im 18
Ah
My god, he sounds like I was about a year ago x.x not even a year

03*fail
4oka then!
4?
12Ew, Drf edit?
/me is shot
03what's wrong with my editing?
03The original Purple Hills/Purple Pills is gross
03seriously, look up the lyrics if you want to be scarred for life...
Woo.
/me looks up.
03LOL
2lol
...
dum internet
WTH
2>.=.> im guessing he doesnt have internet
Why's dat?
4i think he hade something to do on WoW
12Hai, Vyl.
Dpx: who?
Hiya
4vulcan
Just finishing off the episode thing, drf.
/me 4shivers
2idk....... i asked him if he had internet because i had a friend in durango who i wanted him to meet, and he said sorry but no......
03OK
/me stabs VMWare some more
2Shadow, vulcans moniter fried so he couldnt play WOW.
I've gone through every frame, fixing every last flaw...
I'm up to number 30427 now.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
4oooo
/me falls over
I've got VMWare.
03yeah, it's more this XP machine that's annoying
Me too. I use it on my server.
03Noooooo
03Changing the date didn'tg help
03it's still not letting me on without activating./
2*sigh*
2gtg sister needs the comp >.=.>
4by
2ill be back on......
2laters.
I got it down to 8GB lossless :>
Or 130MB lossy.
03LOL
03Lossless ftw, but that's a lot for you to upload
I use VirtualBox on my server
it has proper USB-host support, it has OpenGL acceleration - and it's also totally free ;)
12bai Sky~
12<late>
/me saves the hopefully final version. And it isn't to be resized.
03VMWarez is totally free, trial + keygen
XD
VMWare Server is free, legally.
Part of the reason I dropped out of uni.
03but seriously, what is wrong with this virtual machine
03Heh, why?
03I need VMWare Workstation, it's useless without that
VirtualBox is totally free, as client and without any key :P
03yeah whatever, I like what I have
My final year project was a complex set of scripts and hacks that would allow the training virtual lab to run on open-source virtualisation technology, rather then the vmware ESX server that was the only 'offically supported' solution.
I just had it almost done, when the free server was announced... rendering all my work instantly obsolete.
03o.o
can you dynamically pass-through USB-hardware to the virtual host with VMware?^^
03what do you mean dynamically
/me slaps Vyl
03but if you plug something in with the VM open it conncts to the VM, yes
You can also pass serial and parallel ports.
03LOl serial ports
you can set specific hardware filters to VirtualBox - so it either connects to the host OR the Virtual Machine - depending on what filter you set
03that's so oldschool
03hm
I still use serial ports!
03You probably can in VMWare, I have no reason to.
03LOL
for what?
03My laptop doesn't even HAVE any
My server runs a console on one.
03anyway, meh at safe mode
It's the 'you screwed up so badly the network is down' port.
03stupid thing won't let me transfer files in any way to the VM
03and I need Genuinize XP.exe for it to work
drf, can't you do it over a network share?
that's like a floppy disk drive on a 64Bit operating system :P
03Not in safe mode.
03Doing "safe mode with networking" insists on me rebooting in non-safe mode for activation.
03it has to be standard offline one
03and I can't drag and drop
03I tried burning it to a CD, still nope, "Please insert a disc"
03so how am I supposed to give the file to the VM :/
03I wonder.
Bye.
03registry keys are just text files, right?
03I could just type the thing out myeslf in Notepad...
You could.
Why are you in safe mode?
12Off to bed ^v^
12Night erveryone
Or booting the VM with a linux liveCD.
nighty Arti
And using that to copy the file over.
Cya.
I'll be in bed soon, too
12Seeya tomorrow ^^
Sleep well, Arti.
6there we go x-x
2take care Arti
eh?
what you mean Roara?
6mibbit wasn't letting me join with my normal name
6it happens sometimes
03Oh wow, that's a lot of code.
Lol, mibbit.
03Hm, Linux live *CD, that's a good idea
03.as I can do that.
/me slaps Mibbit for crappiness
/me sits all over Aurora
/me 6flattens Kyu with excess of FLOOF
/me burns through it
Oh, lol.
The only other way I see is real oldschool... xmodem.
/me puts in his Ubuntu 9.04 CD
03That
03that should let me use virtual Ethernet
03Or at least my flash drive.
But if it's a text file and small, typing would be easier.
03it's a registry key.
03it's still a lot of stuff, I'm gonna try Linux
Should have this rip done soon, drf.
03OK
6I'm two away from 1000 pageviews! Ovo
6Ooh, I just caught my own 999.

6Kyu, I'm at 9500 now

6I still don't understand it
6don't bother explaining it though, as I'm busy atm
6ovo
Zhat
6It's not that convoluted, is it?
6making flash cards for tomorrow's presentation
6...
6convoluted
6>_<
6I know what it means, and it's that language that makes me less interested
off to bed now
6ovo
night!
I'll try
6But that's just how I use language! It's deja vu all over again. D:
ro-ro-ro-roara
What contest?
6quan, I'm not saying anything against the language, it's just
07no
07front page.
6there's a line between elaborate...and overworked
/me runs
6Lol, Kyu
6But the English language is built up of these synonyms. Plus, it benefits me when typing papers and the like.
6It's not like I speak this way in real life.
6that's what I mean
6on chat, it's best if you type exactly as you would speak
2Heya guys! ;DD
Hey.
6heck, even in writing stories (although, they can be built upon), write with how you would speak
6But if I did, you'll see that go on and on and on, lots of miscellaneous phrases, and overall rambling. ovo
6My mind can be very active and roundabout.
6GUEST
...Write an essay the way you speak?
Informal essay = fail.
6Nya?
6essays are more...hmm, supposed to be elaborate
Encoding...
2heya Shadow
2and Roara
/me 6is getting sick off of sharpie fumes
2o.o
6I think of formal formats as essays, and informal as speeches. But even those can vary when it comes to, well, formality.
/me 6now suddenly craves strawberry ice cream
/me 6brbs
07lol
/me had that earlier
"The dazzling light burst over tge picturesque plains, causing them to shimmer with a radiant glow". Might see that in a book, no one speaks like that.
gnight all :)
Woo

/me misses my jenny and my hannah :(
2talk slowly and calmly Aurora!
6I'll try
6apparently people think I'm a natural at this, but when we took the "speech phobia assessment test", I scored the highest in the class (meaning I was the most afraid)
2yikes! I'm nervous when speaking in front of people as well, and I usually make mistakes when giving the speech (like I did two times last semester) and wb Quil
/me 6blaaahs
6I don't seem to make mistakes though
6externally, I seem like I'm toally at peace with it
6internally, I feel like I'm gonna die

6hmm
6even though it's TOTALLY contradictory
6CN's real shows
6I liked the ones I saw
07most are amusing
6I forgot the name of it, but there was the roller coaster one where you answered trivia on the ride
6that was cool
adb
07lol
bda

07destroy build destroy is a fun show too
6That show's just a ripoff of Mythbusters.
6yes 8D
6Lots of shows are.
6nah
07pfft
6it's a bigger ripoff of junkyard wars
6which was one of my favorite game shows of all time
07mythbusters just popularized exploding
6xD
6No, wait, I'm thinking of that other show.
07it's not that much of a copy
07XD
2Junkyard Wars!
6What was it called?
07Time Warp?
07o3o
Everything's a rip-off of something.
6No, the other one on CN.
07oh

6like.....ALOT
6Dude was actually a synonym (or was that an insult?) for a certain person in the past
6http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CNReal
6A special thing to note is that the block is failing hard, as completely predicted, but it's still tooling along.
6Luuuuuuuulz.
6You know its bad when That Other Wiki puts a "citation needed" tag regarding whether or not the show is funny. <-- Ovo
07lol
6chowder was cancelled?
6good
lol
it was?
6it was just one of those shows that needed to be deleted from life
I don't like it either
6another is flapjack
and i also hate flapjack
and brb more
6and since I haven't had CN in over a year, I don't know what other crud is on there

I'm... eh.. I don't know.
right now I just.. am.
12i'm not called umbredactyl D:
actually. I might be a little depressed :|
Are you sure?
Depression is pretty serious
I never like seeing fellow TST'ers being depressed. D:
12you know
12if i'm going to unignore quilava
12it'd help if i unignored all of the nicks lol
o.o;
:(
/me pokes Umbreon
12.
^^
..yeah
wait. Umbreon. you didn't use my address or mask?
12and somehow the ignore came back
12after i removed it
:|
/me can't tell if he's still on or not.
12[23:21:28] <Quilava> :|
12[23:21:38] * Quilava can't tell if he's still on or not.
I see.
well uh. I dunno what happened then.
12nor do i
12now i only have 2 things on my ignore list
hmr. well, fixed now
121 i know what it is but the other i'm still confused
mine is empteh
whats the one you don't know?
12*!*44638a32@widget.mibbit.com
uhmm.
lol. I dunno who that is. hard to tell without actually being able to whois them
12the fact it's mibbit doesn't help either
indood..
well
you could remove it and see if anyone annoying 'reappears'
12nah
12do you ever use mibbit?
nope.
12heh
I only did once, and that was through remote controlling Feather's bro's comp
12if i had to guess it's kipi
... nooo its not. he's uhh
48de93d2@TST-7C02B16.mibbit.com
12heh
and his whowas list is really big..
12not surprised
so anyway. what are you up to?
12same old sadness
hmrr. :/
anything I could do to help?
12yeah like i said before find a magical pond that makes all your troubles just magically vanish including the problem of them coming back
chances of that aren't really high enough to rely on :/
12only shot though
thats not entirely true. I'm sure there's a way for you to be able to solve this
2hi Quilava
12soysoy
2umbree
12you'd think i would of found the answer by now
it takes a lot of time :/
and some things you might just have to completely just forget about, not everything can be solved

ro-ro-ro-roara
12roara roara roara
hai~
6AEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6ok, so I've finally sorted out my laptop business
03we just watched Animal House in here
6my parents (who have been telling me that a mac would be best for me) said that a mac wouldn't be best for me
6and me being me...I had no opinion whatsoever lol
03Of course it wouldn't be :P
lol
6all I knew was my parents were going to buy me a laptop
03LOL, name what you want on a laptop and I'll find one
6so they suggested one of those small dell ones
03Ew netbooks
6and then because that would be too basic, they sugggested an inspirion
03Dell... well meh, after the XPS series they suck
03the Studio XPS is OK, but really heavy
6and finally........we decided I wont get one until I leave community college, so I'll be using this one XD
XD
03LOL Aurora, ask your parents what their ideal price is and I can find one...
03Fail
6but this leaves me with this final thought: This laptop is officially mine
6before, it was more of a lent one from my dad
03is it any good?
O:
6but he flat out said "it's your's, so as long as it works, do what you want"
6drf, I like it enough
6tends to be a tad slow, but I think I need to clean it up a bit
03Um
6it's an IBM T-43
03do you know the RAM/cpu?
03That doesn't mean anything to me
lol that's pretty cool though. Having your own laptop and all. O:
03except that it's too old to be Lenovo, LOL
/me has his own laptop
XD
6 1.32 GHz, 1.50 GB RAM
6sounds smallish o-o
hi
07not for an older laptop
03Hm
03that's pretty slow, though
03Windows XP? Or older, even?
6dunno
6wait
03my desktop is 1GB of RAM, but it has 2GHz CPU
6XP
03How do you not know what version of Windows... LOL
03Hm.
03you ... might actually be better with 2000
6I didn't know off the top of my head lol
12somehow i read that as 16GB of RAM
12and i was starting to think what you would need with all of that
03LOL
03I only have 4
03but it's DDR3, which is like super hardcore
03and no, not the videogame.
6well seeing as I wont be buying a new laptop, what could be done to speed this thing up if anything?
12imagining you playing DDR3 would be like picturing Obama playing GTA
6O_O
6LOOOOL
XDDD
03Hm
03So the guys at #P-O say Windows XP should be fine on your laptop.
03rather than 2000.
03but, you might consider using Windows Classic theme, even though it looks oldschool
03as it uses a ton less RAM that way.
12go for linux :D
03Linux ftw
03I dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu
6classic theme?
03Yes.
6will I still be able to have my choice of wallpaper?
03You know what I'm talking about or not?
03Yes.
6</stupidquestion>
03I can take screenshots, hold on
03Lemme start up VMWarez
6I know how to do it
6I was just checking
6woah o-o
03but you know what the difference is?
6what I see looks way weird LOL
6so.....gray and blocky
6XD
03yeah
03that's how Windows always looked
03until XP
2night CR
bye CR
Night~
03XP's theme looks cooler, but uses a ton of CPU/RAM power, so for people who don't have ve3ry much it's suggested to not use it XD
03Especially with Vista/7... Aero theme uses a TON of RAM
0320%, I mean
03even with 4GB
6geez my grandma's computer has vista and it takes ages to load up
/me spams drf, using up the remaining 80%
03LOL
6LOL
03Aurora, turn off Aero then
03>_>
6I will when I go back
/me hides
03well I like it, like I've gotten used to it
03but I have a frickton of RAM too
Turn Aero off? Is that even possible?
/me hides.
03I spent $1700 on this thing
6but then she'll argue that it looks different, and therefore she wont know where everyhting is
03which is why it's beastly
03Haha
6and i'll just have to explain that nothing changed
03you could use Vista Basic
03which is a slightly less cool looking one.
6I'll probably wind up doing that
03I hate 7 Basic
03it's so ... bland looking
03I <3 dark blue
03where's that picture
6also
6my dad said he's bringing me CS3 this weekend~
6I'm happy ^^
6</freeprogram>
03o.o
03is it legal>?
6yeah
6he has one through his company
03LOL
03oh.
03I was gonna say, it's like $4000
03I just pirated it
03sorta
03The installer is actually on adobe.com
6I think the price went down with CS4 out now
03so I got it legally
6but yeah
03I just use a keygen.
6if my dad forgets (most likely will)
6I'll probably do that
03http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/5684/slidet.png <-- This is my modified Aero theme.
6pft
03just a random picture LOL, of a chemistry presentation we did
6looks better than windows classic lo
6lol
03isn't that an awesome color though?
6yes, very
03Yeah I know, right? I don't mind it eating my RAM because it *can*
03I've got loads of it XD
03Yeah
03I hate Vista
03its themes are ugh
03Windows 7 lets you customize it more :)
6it was cool to look at the first couple times loading
6now it's just a pain
6maaaaaaaaaaaaan I haven't seen windows themes look like this in AGES
6lool
07arf
03LOL
03but seriously, if you WANTED a good laptop, I could probably find a good one :o
2hikyu
6nah
03and not like my beastly one that's more expensive than the ripoff CrapBooks even
6now that I have the green light to do what I want, I don't care
/me pokes Roara to post in STA
6this thing'll do anyhting
6Kyu, I already said I have nothing to post
03I mean, the only reaon I didn't mind spendingh $1700 on a laptop is it wasn't my money
6but heck, I'll post anyways
03I had like $2000 total to spend on a computer, from my relatives
6lol
03and LOL Aurora, good luck getting anything Adobe to run on that thing
6my parents aren't that cool
03it'll take 20 minutes to load Photoshop
03I don't mean just my parents
03they only gave me $500.
6...
6I had CS3 on this thing
03plus $500 from my grandparents, and then other relatives etc
07it is your turn to post o3o

I did that once XD
6I'll stop, run my foot along the screen track to be sure that there's no screen
07most glass doors have a screen too lol
6my friends have been trying to break that habit, because it's so silly
6but I cna't help it

6the only one that survived the surgery
6my dentist asked if I wanted it, and I said yeah
6the other ones had to be crushed in order to be removed from my jaw
6so they were in like 5 pieces
6...ew that sounds really gross to think about o-o;
07lol
07my wisdom tooth ached for a couple days once
07it was only one
07but then I went to the dentist and they're all "hey, let's yank them all out"
6my dentist said there was absolutely NO way my lower wisdom teeth would be allowed to stay
07so I was like...screw that...
6my jaw is too small
6so he said might as wel rmeove the tops as well
6my poor friend though...she has 6 wisdom teeth o-o!

12basically a food paste made from yeast extract
Oh.
6http://ca.geocities.com/frankstonhs/webpagecontest/image003.jpg looks like this
Hey.
6?
12i take it it's more of a taste you grow up with
12because every non-australian the person gave the stuff to claimed it was a horrible taste
02lol
It looks like a marmite rip-off. :P
02Vegemite is disgusting
02>.>
02Can't stand it
12i guess it's true
12the most disgusting things seem to be more healthy for you
02lol
02about your Oekaki pic
02I was only giving some feedback
02but I still love the pic in general
02^^
12the guy traveled all over australia except the center lol
Is vegemite black-brown and salty?
12i think so yes
02xD
02yes
6Yes
6Very salty
/me 6pulls a face
So it's the name for marmite in Australia?
6You need lots of butter to offset the saltiness :P
6What
02lolyes
6no
02LOTS
02of
02BUTTER
028D

12It is similar to British, New Zealand, and South African Marmite and to Swiss Cenovis.
12lawl wikipedia quote
6XD
6KICK
6South African marmite XD
It's marketed here as "You either love it or you hate it"
12the US has no such thing lol
12we have peanut butter though
I eat it without butter.
XD

12i'd assume
12kind of like intensely spicy food
12i didn't start pounding away the really hot stuff right away lol
6What

12fun experience really
My dad wouldn't let me try a vindalu till I'd had a jalfresi (sp?).

10i loooooove bluescreen <3
Lol.
10Whatever does "Starting dumping of physical memory" mean anyway
02LOL
02wb
10it scared me. it froze and suddenly BLUE
/midtest 12!guest
/midtest lol
/midtest lollolol
/midtest lollolol
/midtest lollolol
/midtest lollolol
/midtest 12!guest
/midtest 2!guest
12basically it's dropping physical memory
10Whoo
10Ok.
gh!greet on
10usually it happens when the computer freezes TOTALLY so i guess that makes sense
g!greet on
It probably dumps anything that may have corrupted due to the crash.
12you got it all wrong
12physical memory is stuff like your RAM
02xD
"Starting dump of physical memory" means it's currently writing the contents of whatever is in memory, to %windir%\memory.dmp
usually you would use it if you want to debug the reason your system actually crashed
10ok
10so it's desperately trying to save stuff ?
12exactly
12i'm bad at wording that stuff
12and it's not that it's trying to save it, it's more for reflection to find out what caused such a thing
So... it;s making a log of yhe memory at t etimd of crsdh?
to stop it, just go into control panel -> system -> advanced -> Startup and Recovery settings -> tick "Automatically Restart" and where it says "Write debugging information", change that to "Small memory dump"
10ok
Stupid SS...
DS*
so you can bluescreen faster in future ;p
/me accepts what Umbreon offers
10:D
10Blue Screen V.2
02Also
02My router is WPA
02can I change it manually to WEP?
12there is nothing funny about a blue screen
if you really want to find out why your system crashed, go to the %windir%\minidump folder, find the latest file and run that through Debugging Tools for Windows
02o_O
10hmm, well
10i know why it crashed lol
10i basically became impatient and
02xD
02spammed clicks etc....?
12lol /run bluescreen.exe
10wait
10is that really something?
no
12it'd be funny as heck if it were
What kind of router you got?
continue on xeli
you can download it from the microsoft website if you want, called bluescreen, its a screensaver that emulates blue screens
10i think i overloaded it or something
so it only exists if you download it and stick it in the windows folder
10and ok wow
"I think I overloaded it or something" does not give anyone a floofy clue why it blue screened ;p
10no, but it's not that important. i know, it's stupid but that's me ._.
My default router setting page ix 292.168.1.1
the only thing more vauge than that is "I accidently the system... the whole thing"
192*
10LOOOL
giving out a lan IP address means absolutley nothing Umbreon ;p
but you probably knew that
Pff.
You can't unless you're on my network.
/me 's modem is 10.0.0.1, router is 10.0.0.2, server is 10.0.0.11
Meh, whatever. :P
and you get it there, without him telling you ;p
I'm using WEP anyway, so easy to crack. XD
/me cracked WEP in 7 minutes, on a 233mhz laptop running linux...
12that is true
12but it's not fun when you do that
which made me upgrade my network to WPA ;p
02wat
DS can't use WPA. XD
02yeah I know
02I need it to be WEP
02...X_X
10233mhz o-o
02am I able to change the settings to WEP?
02o_O
02:O
02GUEST
Open up CMD, type ipconfig /all
10release... renew
10wait no
Then look at DCHP Server
Hi
Type that into your browser.
Long time no see, again.
10ah, hey
free technical support session has now ended, brb ;p
03o_O Hi
02err
02hang on
02xD
02BP!
/me glomps
Ok. XD
/me glomps back
03:D Hi
03Anyone here own a Nintendo Wii?
02Yes
Yeah.
10Used to, lol
03:D
XD
10You hid it too well ._.
10try less hard next time
Yeah, lol.
02LOL
02that was sad
03Lol
02Okay
Yeah?
02I got the DCHP server thing
Type it into your the URL bar in your browser.
02k
It might come up with a window asking you for your password.
Have you set a router password?
02nope
02got in
Ok.
02lol
02type /server hoohrealm.dynalias.com
02xD
02well
02lol
03:D
I don't kknow`ehat your settings look like.
Mine aew different
02well
02what settings do I have to change?
But if thers is a section called wireless, go on that.
02k
02hurr
02I'm using D-LINK
02well
02after that...?
02Do I have to set my router again?
03o_O
Or possibly security.
02k
No, just have to change a setting.
02k
On mine there is a dropdown box with WPA in it.
Whag make isyour ruter?
Ok, I'm on my computer now.
02oh
02hm
02my router is D-LINK dir-300
02wait
02I found it
02so nvm
Ok.
02thanks anyway
02^^
No problem. :)
02^^
02Oh yeah
02will it affect my internet etc...?
02As in, my other computers?
02well basically
02will it affect anything I do on the internet or how I connect?
Changing settings might disconnect the other computers, you just have to type in the WEP key on them and tick auto-connect.
02hurr
02Vista then?
I'm on XP.
02My other computer uses Vista >.>
It's the same sort of thing.
Also, as has been said, WEP keys are really easy to crack.
02ah well
02I know that
02Do you know something that can crack WPA keys?
02I need one
02to crack my school's
I'm not sure, they are much harder.
02eh xD
02well
02any programs that can find school proxies?
You mean proxies that aren't blacklisted?
02no
02Like
02You know schools? How they have internet
Yep.
02they also have a set proxy server
02you can't connect normally
Oh, ours doesn't.
02you have to enter a correct proxy server in
02or it doesn't work
02freaking annoying
We just need the WPA key to connect at our school.
02Oh
02lol
02my school is annoying with passwords
02they do stuff like PA$$W0RD
Lol.
02botnets will fail even against that lol
02and I really cbb to crack my school's WPA Key
02I tried a couple of times
02ergh no thanks never again
They thought they had CMD blocked at our school. They thought wrong. ;)
03:P
02LOL
I had a notepad file, so it all went wrong for them.
02xD
02They block CMD at our school
If you have a notepad file you can get on it. :P
02but we have access to an "admin" sort of account
Windoes XP flaw.
02a local admin account
02lol
Windows*
02xD
03They do at ours as well, but a friend and I worked out how to get to it.
02CMD is dangerous though xD
02If I got onto our school's network administrator's computer
02oh geez
Meh, after getting on it most stuff is blocked anyway.
Although copying files isn't.
02lotsa things I'd want to do
02lol
02LOL
So we copied the whole of C drive onto someone's account.
02well
02LOLWUT
02xD
02Schools block too many things
02DOIN' A BARREL PROXY DOESN'T WORK AT MY SCHOOL D=
02hm
02do you know the ports that aren't blocked at most schools?
80 is the system port.
02My school uses Altiris client service to watch what we do, which uses port 402 I think
02lol
02I'll try ask Altair that
02do you have a server?
Well, I have a server for making online flash games.
Schools typically redirect outgoing on 80 to a proxy.
But you might be able to get out on TCP 53.
02TCP 53?
It's often unblocked. Try it.
02er well Vyl
Oh, I have one set up, yeah.
02Can you explain
02I suck at TCP/UDP info etc.
03Me too
It's the TCP side of DNS.
02oh right
02well
02I'm trying to get into IRC servers
02._.
02yeah basically
026667 is the most obvious port that's blocked
02tried 8080
02and main chan
I never bothered to set up services. XD
I'm not actually sure if it works, I set it up as my IP.
192.168.1.100
02k
02er
02that's a local IP lol
02not working lol
03whatismyip.com for the win
02xD
02well
Meh, I'll need to put in my external IP then.
BRB.
02k
02BP
02I use whatismyip to stalk people
/me hides
03o_O
10lol
?
02use dynDNS to get a hostname for your IP
02I mean
02Server
02like
02a DNS for your server
Ok.
02like server.dynalias.com
02we have hoohrealm.dynalias.com
02it works pretty well
03o_O
Ok, I made an account.
10be back in a while
02D=
02I dunno what to do though
02you'll have to ask Altair
02who's kinda gone
02or
Yeah, registering a DNS now.
02k
02also, PM?
Sure.
02k
02well
02I don't exactly know how to say this
02Similar to TST
02So uh, think you could link servers to us? Of course, you can be a Network Administrator, with full privileges etc.
02yep
02it's run on unrealIRCD
02hm
02well, the current server is hoohrealm.dynalias.com
02you can try connect if you like
02and yeah
02lol
/me yawns
02need to go
02very soon
02Okay sure
02lol, I have no idea how to set up a server xD Altair was kind enough to set one up for us
02but it's hosted on a laptop running on wi-fi on Windows XP
02which REALLY limits everything xD
02Xeli!
02wb!
10thx
02xD
02Okay, how about hoohrealm.dynalias.net as the server name?
02The server we currently have set up is hoohrealm.dynalias.com
02thanks
02and well, we might have to wait for Altair to come back, since he hosts it
02and has all the files
02although we could start with testing everything on your server lol xD
02damnit
02eh it's okay
02I'd prefer dynalias.net
02but sure
02hang on
10wat
02it should be there
02xD
02I need to go soon
02trying to DELAY 8D
02I'll TRY not to do an all nighter
/me coughs
02try
02TRY
XD
02try
02I really shouldn't
02because I'll be very dead tommorow
10delayclose.jpg
10and :/
02lol
02xD
02well
02I probably won't
02but I'll stay here for a little longer
02don't worry exactly about setting up services atm
02well
02and um...
10mkay
02I think we have one
02not sure
02since that's where Altair set up our services I think
02but yeah
02since he also has them
02but yeah
02I'll see what I can do
02anyway
02I need to go now

2oh, good luck for that lawl
03Last night, rather than studying, my friends and I watched Animal House :P
And Chimstry was in itself the best class I ever had, and I had the best teacher for it. He was hilarious, he made things fun, and he was a good friend of mine.
/rehash
03Our professor is hard to understand :/
03which is why I usually just use IRC during class :P
/me flees
03The only difference is now there's an exam tonight and he's doing review./

Ancient, or present Greece?

/me pokes the missing "m"
And Greeks invented loads of stuff.
12There are two m's.
Medicine, concept of steam engines, loads of mathematical theories.
Astronomy.

12Yes I did.
Plain rice is bland.
Saffron rice FTW.
12Right there.
10Ok then ^^
12I like plain rice from Chinese places. :O
12Not anywhere else, though.
In other words...Rice with butter?
12Chinese people make it the best. <3
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rice <-- It exists!
Meh, I always find their rice is bland.
12:O
12Then...
"When cooked, forbidden rice has the smell of freshly-popped popcorn and turns the water that it is boiling in a brilliant purple color. It has a deep, nutty taste." Mmm... want.
12Well...
12I meant white as in the flavor. XD
/me flees
/me runs
White is a flavour? I thought it was a colour. :o
12It's both.

03then went out and bought it with that money and destroyed it
6XD
03The best one ever is the Xbox and Wii ones
03they waited outside the store for 3 days to get the Xbox, then smashed it in the parking lot in front of people who couldn't get one
03it's awesome.
6even though the wings bug me, I never said I wouldnt want one
6looool
03(Different people, though)
03The Wii one is hilarious, they show these little 12 year old kids crying about how unfair it is
03I mean, in all reality, they paid for it, they can do whatever they want
03it's just funny XD
03I'm gonna make a music video with M.A.D. of all the smashing electronics :P

hi arti :)
6post?
o.o;; what post?
12the one about the dream girl???
6where LOL
12I've wanted to mention that for AGES but I've never had the guts to say that to him XD
12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4312.msg165905#msg165905
12It's not JUST a dream girl, it's a celebrity on TV that he thinks is "the one"
6FINALLY
6someone told him that
6XD
12No it's not too harsh, he shouldn't have told you to grow up
Yeah, thanks. >.< He's really a hypocrit. Ya know, he forced me out of PnT when he was a mod there because he blamed the site's death on me even though I was the one who invited like 20 people.
12PnT? ovO
6looool
6poketo
6it was an old site
And eventually when he got kicked out for being a forceful mod, he blamed the site's staff and called them corrupt
12Meh
12Lets not discuss that in the main chan
Oh, and by forceful I mean, "Accept my opions or be kicked. Also, I'm deleting every post I disagree with"
Sorry, I'll stop
12It's ok

/me looks at the post done by Kipi
eh...yeah...well...if the girl was pretty enough, I would understand...
maybe
but well
nah
12.. But
12She's a celebrityu
12-u
/me shrugs
12So how can you justify that EVEN if she's pretty?
12She's a frikkin person on TV
yeah - another disadvantage
12How can you say you LOVE a person on TV!?!?
...Stupid celebrity obsessors.
12How can you call her your soul mate and all this stupid stuff!? XD
4Some people love cartoon characters, but not in a serious way.
I don't love people from TV. They use to be ugly creatures without being around two hours in the mask
did you see pictures of Madonna or Britney Spears without any makeup?
4I'm not attracted to people by sight anyways..
I remeber when he first started the obsession back in Pnt too... it was right after he got over his obsession with Maya from Pheonix Wright. Back then I didn't think he was that serious about it.
4Yeah I've seen that.
12No but they're ugly enough with make up.
4I don't like how female celebrities encourage anorexia etc.
trust me Arti - ANYONE on TST is WAAAY more beautiful than those "celebrities"
12Nah they don't, some people can't help being famous + slim >(
4I meant people like Posh Spice who hardly eats.
12I thought she did eat fine ovO
12as far as I knew she's healthy, just weirdly skinny XD
4Ah, she looks like she's starving to death to me.
lol
did you hear about this model being fired because she was "too fat"?
12No, but that's horrible
around 1 meter 80 high...
4I don't see why people have to be skinny to be famous to be honest.
...47 kilograms
...fat...
4I mean where you can see their bones popping out, it looks horrible.
Only because it was mentioned on the Jay Leno show
12They don't have to be skinny to be famous, they have to be skinny to be models >v>
12yeh it's disgusting
4Yeah not sure why...
4Gothic models don't have to be skinny :)
in fact they modified her pictures to make her a wask waist on several photos...
now, THAT'S retarded
4But yeah for some reason...popular/trendy type models are skinny and most people are not that skinny.
they are - because the designers want them to look that way
4I wish there were more normal sized models.
that's why I desperately HATE fashion designers
Honestly, I think the whole modeling business is stupid
4If there were a few models who were the siz
4size of most people it would be good*
4Sorry, the dog tapped my keyboard then.
4See you later.
Even then! I just hate the concept of getting rich just because you look attractive and can pose for it.
4I wouldn't like to be famous, I don't like people knowing 100% of my business.
yeah, but honestly: Which normal sized woman wears size 34?
4European size? As that's massive in the UK
european size, yeah
>p I'd rather be rich than famous.
4I meant a size which wouldn't encourage teenagers to stop eating.
4I had a friend who never ate a thing...and now she's paying the price for it -_-
12I don't even know the sizes LOL
12Wtf is size 34 in British sizes?
4Don't know, will look.
!help greet
2(Articuno2): I suspect, considering your figure, you'd be a size 38 - as you're quite slim
4I'm a size 16 in UK clothing.
well, 34 would be a 12
12Are you sure?
12I'm a size 8..
412 is a normal size for some women here
412*
4damn I meant 12
hrm - wait, I'll go and look it up
4It keeps doing that
12you must have it wrong lol
12LOL 16
1sec
4Erm...I'm healthy
4lol
12Ahh I'm a 36 apparently ..
4I would have to stop eating anything at all to get slimmer
12But only last year I was 34 -_____-
well - which size is 34? S or M?
12RN sorry I didnt mean lol at the size, I thought you meant you typoed it
4Weight means nothing, it's personality that counts.
12I was gonna say "that was a big typo to make"
4LOL it's ok! I know I'm chubby...and proud!
4LOLOL it's fine, you don't need to apologise xD
12What do you mean S or M? Ovo
in that case Arti - the model cloth size is usually either XS or XXS
12Oh right
12it's S
4I'm a fatty and I have a fatty dog xD
12actually might be XS
12I dunno
4But am glad about it haha
XP I'm only skinny because of a ridiculously high metabolism
4We are working on it....we go for 2 hour walks twice a week
whew, hope you're not that skinny I rub some feathers off when I hug you^^
12Do you know what a size 36 is then?
4Yeah I used to eat like mad and never put on weight, I am trying to get out of those eating habits now because I no longer have the metabolism
well
S---M---L---XL---XXL
36/38---40/42---44/46---48---50
12lol ok
4It's like shoe sizes in Europe
for the ladies
03o.o
12I used to be XS but I eated even more foods when I moved out of my parents
4I wear some men's t-shirts and coats (because of the style) and they confuse me even more
S---M---L---XL---XXL
44---46/48---50/52---54---56
for the gentlemen
4Arti that's cos your parents alway forgot to do some shopping remember?
4lol 'there's never anything to eat in this house!'
12Yep >v>
12I HATED that
!help
!help
03o.o
03there was nothing to eat in MY house either
03which is why dorm ftw
4lol
17 days. 7 hours, and 27 minutes till my b-day.
If there's nothing to eat, I just drink water till I'm not hungry.
4Yay!
4It's my bday on the 9th November.
4Water doesn't fill me up.
OÏ‰O
4lol! nice
Water fills everyone up. :P
4It doesn't to me.
4I wish it did.
My tail's already wrapped up in a bow! Should I try make myself a gift to you?
12Well you'll making me hungry, brbrb
It takes up space, with a full stomach, you stop feeling hungry. O_o
4I'm eating my dessert
4I don't....I feel hungry all the time and never full though.
You eat while watching TV/ using the computer?
Eat bread stuff
4I eat meals at the computer.
03eating while watching TV FTW
4And watching TV
03Computer, not if it's MY computer, as that makes the keyboard all greasy XD
Yeah, the distraction stops you from feeling full.
4there's no point in using the table as I'm the only one ever in.
4I meant I can wake up in the early hours and have an empty stomach.
4At work is the worst, the extreme boredom makes me snack.
Meh, staying up late you get hungry again.
Or if you wake up.
4Yeah, I have to stay up late though.
6Hey RDX
Snack on peanuts
4I get what you mean. I can't eat at the table because I get bored.
7RAWR
Nuts are 50% fat.
4I'm the type of person who has to be doing stuff constantly, can't sit there doing nothing while eating.
O_o
Reduced fat XP
XD
4Everything that tastes nice is bad for you, it's the world's con.
03XD
Nah, fruit.
03Unhealthy food FTW
Blah, nevermind! Ignore me! XD
4I heard ya
7The chat was being boring.
4I can't eat sloppy fruit but some is ok.
4I prefer crunchy food to be honest.
Eat pears, apples and nectarines when they are really unripe. XD
4I don't like any of those xD
O_O
4Why, are they crunchy?
You don't like them?
They are if not ripe.
Although they aren't as sweet.
4No, I dislike the taste and the sloppyness.
4I don't mind blueberries though.
6lol
Oh, they're good.
You should just eat lots of those as snacks. :P
4We were forced to eat apples in school too so I can't now.
4I can't, they don't taste nice lol but thanks for the idea.
4I try not to eat anything as a snack if I can help it.
Cocanut.
4I gave in today though, overate majorly, I won't do it again.
They aren't sloppy.
4Can't stand coconut either. Tried it.
...
4I don't mind blueberries like I say as they are little and easy to eat.
Lol I was playing retro games 8D
4Cool.
7*considers opening a pandora's box better left shut, just for interestings*
D: Forgot to press enter. BRB FOOOOOODS!!!!!
12Sometimes I hate the food shopping, I am having a REALLY hard time deciding what to eat
4I thought I'd like coconut.
Meh, I'll eat pretty much anything.
4Arti, do you have a sainsbury's local?
4I'm a really fussy eater as you can tell haha.
12Yeh we do ^^
14Anyway AFK, dinner is needed!
4Ok
12Ovo
12That kinda came out of nowhere didn't it LOL
4I've had mine
4I think everyone is making everyone else hungry
My favourite fruit is watermelon.
6o.o
4I like that too, I know it's sloppy but it's kind of an exception with me.
Have you tried...Lichi?
Mmm, pineapple.
Raspberries, cherries, pineapple, watermelon.
12Yeh
12But it's too fussy
4Never heard of lichi
12Lychee I think
4I like cherries too, they're nice.
4Never heard of it, is it posh nosh? xD
12nope XD
Either spelling is accepted, I think
4Ok.
I hate grapefruit, I just can't stand it.
12I love it!
How anyone can is beyond me.
4I used to put sugar on it
4but that defeats the object
12I dont even put sugar
12Pink grapefruit is nicest
My dad likes them without sugar.
4We also used to dip strawberries in sugar but I stopped when I learnt how bad it was.
12:O XD
4My auntie taught me that one, don't blame me xD
Arti, you may officially laugh at me now
12mmm? Ovo
Pomegranates?
I'm a german in germany - the home and origin of beer brewery. And I'm just having a Kilkenny Irish beer
12LOVE THOSE TOO
12Lol sorry I just don't get it ^^
Yeah, I like them.
4I get a really, really bad chest when I eat those, not sure why. Does it affect asthmatics badly or something?
12O___o
12Dunno never heard of that!
4With watermelons, I find that if I buy one I waste most of it so I try to wrap up the pieces in the fridge to take bits to work.
and oh, did you reach the hotel's reception already Arti?
or shall I give it a try tomorrow from the office?
12Actually I asked Xai to do it but not even sure if he has, he never said :/
4brb you've just reminded me, I need to make a call to Spain
4brb
12Probably forgot, otherwise he'd have left a note or something
12I'll call them now and hope they're open
4Aren't receptionists always there to give you your key?
they should be. I'll be getting there at around 10pm when I get to england :P

Heh
Pff, Halloween.
We don't celebrate halloween at all
Infact
I've never
Same.
4We can't rent or buy a house at the min, our own fault really.
03LOL
touched a pumpkin
^ Same
nor have I ever eaten turkey o3o
seriously asdf
4We have chinese food etc.
Ah ^-^
In Norway we have the loveliest food ever
but
this yea
r
I dont know what I'll be having
as I'll be with Arrow
Now what would be interesting would be if your boyfriend didn't live with his parents but you were.
so aaaa UN-traditions
4McDonalds
03McDonald's FTW
:( oh the horror
LOL
I love the fries
I know. :P
03fried chicken FTW
4I thought that but just checking.
03I don't like burgers.
03regardless where.
If I really wanted to
I could move out in January
I remember that McDonalds advert years ago.
I'm financially independent right as of now
z.z
so even though he's older than me .. well yeah
4my mum's kinda financially dependent on me at the moment which is why I haven't yet moved out
"Now made with 4100% 1chicken breast", and I was thinking...WHAT THE HELL WAS IT MADE FROM BEFORE?
its completely screwed
4But she'll get sorted
100%*
LOL!
03you mean 100 LOL
03Yeah
03but eh
4Chickens don't have breasts anyways
Mmm, hope she gets sorted soon
Oo
4They don't feed their young milk...
THEN WHAT DO THEY HAVE
oh
4Well they have a chest
wait
chests
o3o
03o.o
aaaaaaaaaaargh
YOU
03leave it to girls to bring that up
/me runs
RE MAKING ME THINK OF ANTHRO BIRDS
now
4I didn't mean in a rude sense
kthnxbai
03I try to not, because if boys bring it up it's considered gutterminded
4I just meant how can a bird have that
03and eh, I admit it
03so...
XD
I have my mind in the gutter a lot
03yeah but still
Mum and me love double entendres
But
4It's like saying 'made from 100% cow wings'
here is not the place
LOL
03XD
I misread wings as wigs
COW WIGS
03Of course it is :O
/me runs
NOW FOR SALE AT WALMART
03I need to go to Wal-Mart soemtime.
03to get the exclusive release of Transformers 2
4Saying the proper name for a body part, not meant in a disgusting manner is fine :P
Heheh, no Wal-Marts here.
'
arharhhar
4Asda here owned by Wal-Mart
Aj
Ah*
Asda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh meeeeps
03asdrf?
that reminds me
...Asda is owned by Wal-Mart?
4Yes.
I'm havign Arrow take me to taco bell :3
I've never been there either
My God! I'm glad I don't shop there.
so yar
I told him to
03Taco Hell?
03I only like... one thing there.
XD
03their 89-cent cheese rollups
Im unbiased
o3o
03I usually get like 5 of those
Happy stuff?
Like what
4Like group exercises where they have to chant happy phrases, it drives them insane.
03o.o
4In training, I mean.
o.O
what do they have to say
XP
4Stuff like 'Walmart is the happiest place to work'
the US, fleh
and LOL
4It's propaganda
03LOL
03well
Apparently due to the contract the McDonald workers enter, if you have the McDonald's tune they have to say "I'm lovin' it", probably made up though.
YOGHURT FOR TH EPEOPLE
hum*
4They say Walmart not Asda because it's owned by them.
03would you rather say "You guys are working at Wal-Mart, you bunch of pathetic losers, go back to school"
4And his 10% off card says Walmart and not Asda
03So what they do actually makes a lot of sense.
4DRF, there's no other jobs here at the min.
>.>
03"at the min"?
4You either take a crappy job or don't have one lol.
03LOL
03oh, minute
Also
03I thought you meant minimum'
>.o
12LMAO
4Ah, meant 'minute' yeah.
03but I say it's BS
12Stupid non British people *runs*
03I made $425 a week this summer
03as a camp instructor
12DRF, it's not always what you know it's who you know
03and I looked for that job for all of 2 seconds
03People are just LAZY
4I say this to Obsi himself xD
03That's why they don't have jobs
03lazy/stupidity
12I couldn't get a job at the crappiest place ever because they only employed people with links..
03they're there, people just don't look hard enough :)
03LOL
03so wha tyou do is
03find someone who knows someone
4Burnett only got a job at Asda because his mum works there.
12Right, so I'm lazy and stupid? Aren't you describing yourself?
/me runs
03LOL
03I'm lazy, not stupid
4And his dad...
PM
12You're both
12With what you're saying you're very obviously both
03LOL no way
/me get some popcorn
12You are DRF, you're absolutely ignorant
12You may be smart but you're not wise :/
03I'm only ignorant when I need to be :P
12No, you're ignorant all the time
03think what you want, LOL
12Like now, saying that people don't look hard enough for jobs, are you saying I didn't?
03I'm talking about around here.
Yeah, I'm in something like the top 2% of intelligence in the UK, which makes it hard to imagine what average people are like. :o
03but seriously, in Michigan there are tons of jobs, people are just too stupid
03or they're like "waaah, I don't want to work there, I want somewhere that's only a minute's drive"
03so they'd rather just abuse welfare
If you're really lazy, just go on the internet and spam google adds, and get paid for it. XD
Meh, netsplit.

Igodochoresnowbye
Wow, not many people in here
Hm.
hey Dari
Hey.
What's up?
hi
and nothing is up \o\
/list
Hey Skylands
currently looking for something to be up for
!!!
hi2u
10Heya
I'm trying to force myself to do this Annotated Bibliography. It's not going well.
Also came here to talk to Arti about something, appears she's AFK.
/list
Or maybe not paying attention?
/me pokes Articuno
I think she might have gone to make something to eat.
/whois Articuno
ah, okay. She appears to be on the forum (3 minutes ago) so I wasn't sure
12got the travel channel?
No, unfortunately. I don't have any channels here at my flat.
12apparently on the travel channel there is this show where this guy goes from place to place exploring "bizarre" things about a place and apparently tuesday he's doing an episode on wisconsin lol
Hmm, that sounds awesome. Might have to record that back home.
12memory serves it's tuesday at 9PM
...
12hi sis
12well that's not a good sign
lol?
12i don't see the humor in it
12>:O
12Yumichika is so hilarious. D=
What's that?
12....
12*Who's
12Yumichika is a person. D=
/me thought it was the name of an anime or manga or something like that
12He's from Bleach.
12X3
/me pokes Yumichika's eyebrow/eyelash things
12I can't even think up a name for 'em!
12D=
Hi.
/me curls up
whats wrong?
Well
The situation just worsened.
I don't know where I stand with Arrow at all now
and it's tearing me apart.
Though I should just desensitivise myself to it I suppose.
murr.. anything I can do for you?
Dpm
Dont think so
Except rewinding time maybes
:(
everyone always tells me to do impossible things <.<
Lol
thats why I said no
don't
/me acceptd
s*
Sorry
Im not thinking clearlt
y
/me swipes a biscuit
07arf
Kyu, you need to stop being judgmental
Ok, sec.
07and you need to stop thinking people's opinions are pathetic
Uh, what?
Kipi was trying to tell me WHAT I believed, when he was horribly wrong.
You don't know me at all, so stop pretending you do. And Arti, PM?
12I think you did the same thing though
12Ok sure..
LOL, believe it or not there is another viewpoint.
And it is also correct.
12Yes?
Not a religious one. :P
I'll post it, sec.
4How'd that happen? xD
14Lol
Posted.
12hai RN~
alt F4 will make your computer tell you the numbers for the next lottery?
12But that's getting REALLY technical I think XD
So really it just depends on how you see things.
12Yeh, I actually see it that way as well, but prefer to just see it the other way if that makes sense
Yeah.
/me pokes Arti to the question in the other channel o3o
Well, all the possible viewpoints on the topic already exhausted...Unless someone religious comes along who thinks that evolution is wrong.
12No doubt
12>v>
12o.o
whut?
Alright
I'm going to nest fairly soon
But
4lol what did I miss?
4And ohnoes communist people
As of right now, I'm single. Whether that will change when/if Arrow gets back in touch with me, I do not know, but... Yeah.
That's that.
4Sorry to hear that :(
/me stares blankly into the air
/me crosses fingers for you
/me hugs
12huh..? What happened?
Articuno, nothing, except that he keeps fleeing from me.
4I left it months before I told most people and the very next week we got back together...
4Aww :(
4SPLIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Agh
lol Kyu :p
12lol Kyu
07why can't your relationship be as black and white as my sister's one XD
Kyu, PM?
07k
same here :/
4SPLIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
12another one o.o
4I just wait to get back together, and the day comes
[23:00:27] <Kyu> why can't your relationship be as black and white as my sister's one XD <- meaning? LOL
And thanks RN, we'll see--but as I said until Arrow gets in touch with me I'm single
07her boyfriend moved away last month
4Ok
07then they just simply ended it lol
And lol Kyu x.x
4I'm the sort of person who just waits and waits for them to come back - and I don't change my status on facebook, but I'm just weird ^^
Arrow and i were/are too strongly emotionally connected. And mmm
eww
I'm not sure I should change my facebook status to single
He's not on there but a lot of our friends are
4It's a personal choice
4I just didn't want my friends, family or workmates to know
4and so they didn't...
4I'm old fashioned and strange though like I say.
4I just follow the examples of my parents I guess.
Mm.
Egh I'm really out of it.
/me hugs back. ^^
and I still wonder why I'm not registered to Facebook^^
but I'm missing nothing
:P
03LOL
Besides people pester me if I'm not registered!!!
03Facebook stalking FTW
/me runs
12o.o
03though ew private profiles, it's no fun if I can't browse photo galleries of random hot chicks
/me hides
12lol
/me hasn't joined facebook :\
4Yeah but if profiles were not private, my employers/future employers would find out some things about me haha
03that's why you don't put bad stuff on there.
03Heck, the company I worked for this summer... I'm ON their page
03like, as a fan and such
4I don't put bad stuff on there, just they won't like the fact I stay up til 1am on a worknight
4So it's good they can't see that. And I'm not late for work.
:O
hi
12hai NS~
03LOL
03Nah, see, my employer was cool
hey NS
03I actually posted stuff on their wall a f8ew times
03-8
4I'm never too tired to do my job either...but if they found that out, they wouldn't like it
4It's none of their business what I do in my spare time though.
03LOL
03Whatever, I still just don't like private profiles
4Yeah, I suppose it's ok for under 18s
4for obvious reasons
03it's like... the whole reason of joining a social network site is to share stuff with people, right? So then why would you NOT
03it's stupid
4You're only meant to add people you know and stuff
03it's like getting a phone, but making it so only your two best friends can call you
/me pokes Skylands to PM
03seems stupid, right?
4not that you have to
03or even more than two
03but if only people you knew personally could call you
4Yeah, true...but you don't want private info falling into the wrong hands.
03then don't put *private* info on there
4Like your name and what city you live in?
4People can find out where you live from that.
03that's called a phone book.
4I'm ex-directory.
03so it's called intelius
/me runs
4So I don't want people finding out my number.
03We're unlisted too but if you pay $5 they'll give it out
03Crazy, right?
hm
03but ... why would you put your phone number on Facebook
03I mean, you can find out someone's name easily
03you can't hide your entire entry from a phone book, your name and address will always be public...
4I didn't say I did
How's it going?
03so my point being, all that stuff can easily be googled anywAY
4Here in the UK you can be exempt from records.
03*anyway
03it's like hackers
03if they want to get your info they'll get your info
4You can even choose not to have your name on the electoral roll.
03whether you give it our or not.
03That's stupid.
4SPLIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!

6that's all I ate for a week out there because I had a massively sore throat and it was mild enough not to aggrivate it
12Actually carbonara is just egg, bacon, parsely and olive oil with pasta
got 7 today and they are putting out a new batch monday
4Does anyone know, if a worm gets injured, can it heal quickly?
12They don't even add cream a lot of the time
4My dog just brought one in :(
4But I let it go
12I dunno about quickly..
12Guesties~
6but cream is good :O
07as long as they're not crushed
4My stupid dog keeps bringing worms in and I keep taking them off him
6worms, the only things that can be in two places at once
6</badjoke>
4I hope they won't suffer is what I mean
07if it was cut in half, then it'll heal as 2 worms o3o
12LOLZ
My cat used to bring slowworms home lol
12O____o
6slowworms? o-o
12Slow worms? For real?
4so, it won't cause them to die in a painful manner if I let them go after my dog has bitten them? not in half
Yep
12There are slow worms in essex? XD
6what's a slow worm?
12A lizard
6!
12Without legs
6awesome o-o
Though it looks like a very small snake XD
12So it looks like a snake, but it very obviously still a lizarfd
4he's at it AGAIN how many worms are out there?
12http://www.arkive.org/media/06/062851CB-DB0F-4D65-843C-E7298127D151/Presentation.Large/photo.jpg
4maybe the same one keeps coming back for more
bye everyone
need to go
4See ya
/me huggles alll and poofs
12The easiest way to tell it apart is the head, in snakes, it slims towards the neck
12bai NS~
12But it's just joined solid all the way on a slow worm
And Arti yeah there is a load of slow worms in Essex
4So, me putting the worms back isn't gonna cause them to suffer?
12I've never seen them
12Nope RN
>_> so much for getting new super mario bros. next month
4Good, cos I didn't want them bleeding to death or something.
07they won't
4My dog is really cruel, he plays with things
4But I take them off him
4im not in to mario
6I play with flies until they die or I wind up squashing them :/
12When I was in primary, I used to find worms in the playground that had been trampled and I used to take them and stuff their insides back in then wrap them with grass :D
4Awww
6O_o
6arti
6that line made me lose my appetite x-x
4I've seen crows treat other birds badly
12Sorry LOL
07XD
12and yes, crows are predators
LOOOOOL
12Few people know that
6lol I do
4Yeah but they also torture their prey, it's bad
12Think of them as little humans
4Little chavs
12Nah they don't, they just eat them alive
4Yeah that
12Saves time and energy
4That's kind of cruel though, even for the animal world
4Then again, Orcas play with their food too
4crows are meant to be intelligent though
6intelligent, yes
6but the basics of life
12They are, but it's more uimportant to eat your food before someone else does XD
12-u
4humans feed them though...
12Orcas don't have to worry because they're at the top of the food chain
4but I guess they don't understand
12Humans do not feed all crows!
Bah
I'm mildly obsessive
12I've never seen country folk take a liking to crows enough to feed them
oops
lol
hiiiiiiiiii
i like crows
12XD
I saw one
6I LOVE crows and ravens
6so pretty
12I gotta go D:
6we had a flock of like 100 over my house last week, it was STRANGE
6so many x-x
12brb
4I meant city crows
Ok bai arti
12Can I be annoying and say POOR LEEENOOOOOOHHHHHHH

/me runs

4All the worms are now safely outside by the way...
07^.-.^
4My dog was bringing them in, putting them on the floor, staring at them and then biting them, the cruel little thing, didn't even want to eat them.
When I went for a run earlier, a cow randomly mooed.
4He does that with snails too, he brings them in and just plays with them.
12g2g...

Hi, guys
Long time no see
*Shrug*
/j #aqua-vitae
/j #dm
Hey Vyl
How are you?
/list
Vyl: I could be better, could be worse.
You?
Not bad. I'm trying to clear through the backlog of unread emails. Very, very slowly.
I want to give the loft a clearout too today.
Perhaps throw out the old rabbit cage. As we no longer have a rabbit.
Lol, Ubuntu is so slow.
In what way?
Starting it up for the first time.
Not actually installing it though.
I just clicked the "try it" button, so it shouldn't take this long. O_o
Oh. Running it off the CD?
Oh, yeah.
Lol.
That will be slow. CDs are just very, very slow media.
DVDs only barely better.
I completely forgot that it was on a CD. XD
/me preens Vyl
/me chirrs happily and ruffles a little, soon returning that preening.
/me fluffs up.
/me chirrs loudly.
Hey.
Heya
Need to go post some letters, be back in 10 minutes.

/me blah's
exploration is floof
I'm going to have to suffer the episode myself to test it.
Ok :P
But not yet.
6Hello anyone there?
I really don't want to have to listen to dubbed pokemon.
6well goodbye i was just wanting to check on somethings.
Though every time I see the ending of the episode, where they fly on a disc propelled by a giant rainbow, I have an urge to dub 'It's OK 2 b gay' over it and put it on youtube.
Half an hour, then I'll suffer it.
Ok Lol
/me commences suffering.
/me squeaks
Ick... the sunflora voice actor is either processed, or it must really hurt going up that high.

12Ok, remember to book a room on the opposite side of the railway due to the construction noise
12Unless you're not bothered by it.

12Ok but can you get to sleep while a nuke is going off?

7Raaaar!

6I didn't get a chance before... :P
7:P
I don't get the point of the sims tbh.
Yeah well I'm playing a game a little bit more fun :P
I think it's pretty pointless doing something virtually when you can do it for real. XD
LOL
4I can't become a rockstar for real.
You can learn to play an instrument. :P
4I can't, it's too difficult.
4I'm addicted to the Sims 3 anyways.
4I do get out and do other things, I go on it for like half an hour.
4I also am not rich enough to buy an electric guitar xD
4Haha.
http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Musicians-Gear-Electric-Guitar-Pack?sku=582102
4I'd rather play a game that I like playing and which harms no one than upset the neighbours haha. Thanks though :)
14Hey guys
hello
7Hey vulcan.
6Hey
electric guitars A: don't harm anyone (other than yourself, with blisters), and you don't HAVE to have it ungodly loud.
14How are you guys doing?
usually don't harm
6I'm just being bored as always
6You?
like video games, they USUALLY don't harm anyone.
:D
7eh. The people at school are really beginning to trigger the crazy-ass parts of my mind. I just want to beat them to death with various kitchen supplies
14bored. >.=.<

;~;
Me no gusta linky.
10what
Just say no...Unless they offer you money.
I was there. :P
7Oh yeah.
14Im always in character.
7I sometimes forget because you're such an active person in the chat, you're like a piece of furniture.
10I did. It was fairly silly.
7what happened to flash DM?
10Estoy usando el internet.
14So its only towards her character, not her owner. >.=.<
10If uso is made usando for "currently happening action" or whatever.
Que o.o;
7and I mean odd-shapes warped
7I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be a trapezium.
14ah.
7and honestly, irritating her is funny. She contradicts herself so much, the only way to untangle it is with a buzz-saw.
Hey Xenon.
:P
7hello None.
Than?
Today is a sad day, to be sure.
7true.
I'm too lazy to make graphics that would look good as it would take me aaaaaaages.
Bye bye, Xbox 360. :(
Well, at least for a few weeks.
Then animating them too. O_o
Usando means 'using'
LOL
Stickmen FTW.
14ah.
10Yeah! I won!
108D
7I know someone who is an EPIC animator given said crappy software and some addons, and he has no life so is bored constantly.
Like 'uso' is the present tense of 'usar', to use
Funny thing is I have an Arcade, which means that this error shouldn't be possible.
And it's generally caused by overheating, which I am extremely careful about and never caused.
7*goes to find the shitty video they made* I tried once, and decided I didn't have the patience.
7and I never could get the hang of walking.
Uso CAN mean using, "Uso el internet", but it can also be used for other present tense, like, "I use the internet"
10As in "I use the internet sometimes"
Uso el internet a veces.
10Usando = "I am using the internet now" ?
10o3o
Basically.
The 'currently' is implied.
It's not said.
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plc2wygwPt4 It's in order of first-last.
Er, usando is 'using', in the sense that it's current and right now
So, yeah.
10Well, i sort of know. At least i have learned something in spanish class at school
And the 'estoy' part of it is the 'I am'
4Hi Mike
hi
Or 'yo estoy'
hi :)
7the credits are just crappy move-maker things.
14Teh Cynderz is being quiet.
12.
Quid es tu rogis?
Dunno what that means.
Yeah, it's not Spanish.
6Wut?
Figured.
14...
Latin?
6Ohz
Yeah.
14TEH CYNDERS!!! X3
k.
What does it mean, anyway?
6=D
What are you asking?
7... don't encourage her!
10hah
Is what it means.
6Lol
6OH YA
14too late.
6No,not that
14your liitle motto made me laugh more then once.
7no.
Argh. Because if you did there's a L33t Sp34k setting for the language.
Funny stuff.

6TELL ME I GOT THE RIGHT SONG

14*snugs him* ^.=.^
You have the MOTD file?
/me 4shoots a little fire ball ate snout
yeah^^
and don't worry about services
I just have the conf Alt made
Altair is managing them
Ah, I've already got the conf set up.
yeah
I can tell ;/
4vulcans
4snout
XD
and she offered to put a request on the Nintendo public blackboard asking for a Giant Lugia plush for me within whole Nintendo^^
IRC ops etc. with permissions xD
Oh yeah, I need that though.
I think Alt's conf is very bad, but it's the example, so...
yeah
and it's been updated lol
What's wrong with it?
/me 14deflects with his wing
Nothing, it's just cluttered because of example.
well, let's say it's not properly set up, k?
lol
Ah.
4you cant do that
It is set up properly.
well i dunno
?
that's awesome!
I already have a Lugia plush
^v^
which I think he forgot before
14Yes i can. Metalized
xD
k
and do you think we could have a DNS sort of thing
/me 4grumbles
Domain?
It'd require monies
2ill brb
that connects people to one of the servers?
2gtg mop a floor for my mom
14gonna go for now
like irc.lugia.us
14ttyl
well we're waiting for a domain atm
I THINK that's called a round robin
we should get one soon enough
I dunno, though.
4by
Okay
Think we could have one though?
and set it up with our java chat thing
:O
nice, TS!
The cheapest domains are around £3 a month.
lucky you lol
lol
because well, we kinda have a site
so yeah
we're waiting to get a domain
I know how to, but I'm not getting the activation email
which is a bit of a problem
well, Altair and some others have tried as well
with no avail
Send them an email.
tried
return error
I think their email server is screwed
LOL. .info's are £1.23 a YEAR.
lol
I want .net
and besides
.net £9.99 a year, on this site.
Cheap, lol.
lol
I don't have any money or the resources to do that
14hi
Okay
I have money
but I can't do it
not allowed :/
hi
and there's this site called trap17 and another called Astahost
they literally allow you to have a free domain site thing
/me 4lays down and curls up
you just need to be active and post
Hm.
you get "money" for that
I know you don't I?
except I'm not getting the activation email from the forums
14idk i havent been on in forever lol
:/
lol hi
I know you lol
/me runs

/me 14follows and throws a cookie at
/me shoots NS with a cookie launcher
14hey that works much better!lol
wanna try?
14yeah! *jacks cookie launcher and launches at night*
anyone know how to force an application to shut down without using task manager?
hurr
um
14no idea
Close it?
/me runs
no hm
i would have handed it over, lol
Hm, .co.uk is 25p a month...Lol
I think you can only use Task Manager
<coughAltF4cough>
LOL
why is that so expensive?
14scream at it and try to right click it repeatedly nd close it!
well I want www.ho-ohrealm.net xD
I said FORCE it to shut down
never mind, gonna reboot.
14ok lol
or you could do that
14my idea was better XD
erm.
crap. I might have gotten something on my computer.
agreed
I'm gonna scan before I reboot
.net is 83p a month, lol.
14O_o u do that
wow... timing fail for me
/me 4falls asleep
14im gonna go brb and work on my show!
kk
bah.. never mind. brb
O_o A custom email address costs 5p more a month than a .net domain name, lol.
kk
eh.
/list
Why can't we have .info?
/me is more or less a 'whatever works' kind of person.

most likely something in the config
You set up the link in your config, Altair?
eh lol yeah
no o.o
Ok.
i didnt even know there was gonna be another one until today lol
Lol, ok.
lol
eh
so

e
can you herd them into a hallway?
OH
That's why Altair
or lure
You haven't set me as admin
12that's what i did
lol
12but then after i'm done with the monster house
ok
12i go into the room that was the monster house and run into a confuse trap
see
lol
lol
just keep attacking until you recover
12then i take one step to try breaking out of confusion and instantly go into a selfdestruct trap right next to it
hang on
i doubt you can do anything to oper up
12then when still trying to break out of confusion i run into another confusion trap
i'll change it in a bit
Altair
just stay still and use ur regular attack
You're awesome, Altair
I love the idea
i guess i need to get you oper'd
and that's not sarcasm
lol
tym
yeah xD
2ill brb
tym?
ty, much
5ok
ah

/me noms on Altair and Presea
lol
just to see if i could
and to see what it was like
lol
lol
lolwat
Ok, then, we ready to see if it links?

I still dislike having to type /msg StuffServ
:|
so i never noticed
I'm used to it.
:/
12???
But I dislike it.
what's an "andalite?"
i just made a script to get around that
If we disable the Andalite, Visser 3 will reward us well!
it's so easy, idk why arti just doesn't add it...
I'm used to the /cs /ns aliases.
lol
yeah mirc does aliases
disable??
I'm used to both
I'd very much prefer the /?s
2capture the Andalite!!!
/me is clueless...

/me is too
ah

lolololololol
and bring in True, Presea
/me pulls out a Dracon Beam, "SURRENDER, Andalite!" -Points it at Quilava!-

Eh?
6thats lots of spam
I had more than 5
my router?
hmm
ya it could be a router issue
as the connection was refused
xD

after i had 5 bots+ me
axD
so a total of 6
it was set to max clients 5 i think
lol
well
I set exception on Presea
per ip
I did that
Hm.
to enable unlimited connections
thanks ecco :4
Altair, where's the MD5 bit?

I got messages saying that modes couldn't be set etc.
Lugia's Theme is the best song to come out of a Pokemon movie thus far.

a server
causing the problem
ah
'jupe' basically makes a logical 'copy' of a server
lol
ya
k
It's not there, but the server thinks it it
is*
what about noop?
ah
kind of like a ghost?
sorta
Yeah, kinda.

07lol
6so, I had an art history exam that I really wasn't ready for
07my day was irritating too o3o
6but when we got it, I could answer everything!
12a monster house came out of the room with the stairs so i throw out a totter orb and walk around them to the ladder lol
6it was all stuff I knew
07we have this new art project
what the? it doesn't say my whole name, why?
12you need a placeholder, Cyber
Umby, get a halloween name
12like a "-" or a "_"
07where we have to draw a big black and white picture based on a reference
12spaces aren't allowed in names
6the teacher couldn't get the slide show to start for the visual naming part, so while waiting I put the names, dates, and origin cultures together on the answer sheet so I'd just have to put them in order
07but we only draw one section of the picture at a time
place holder?
2back
6and then she said the slide show wasn't going to work, so we'll do it next week
12yes
07and I kept getting the details wrong >.-.<

/me sits on the back of a Salamence

I think they should introduce something like you pay if you don't pass and do your work
then you'd pay for being lazy
07lol
everyone can learn, so its not as if people can say stupid kids get left out
morning
:>
morning Arti
/me is just connecting from work to his home server atm ;)
I'm still on my way in to work
and even in a VERY funny way^^
mmm?
Well, I'm on Remote Desktop now
running on a Virtual Machine
being connected via Bridging with my work notebook
usinnng openVPN
lol!
my work notebook uses openVPN to get access to the internet
at home, my physical server is running a logical server WITHIN ANOTHER virtual machine that's running the openVPN server I'm connecting to
I'm not really allowed a laptop or anything at work
that's my corporate notebook
/me can't even believe she is awake -v-
lucky
a sweet ThinkPad T500
partly lucky arti. As I have to take it with me quite often....to be able to work wherever I am^^
lol last time a carried my massive laptop to work, my arm was hurting for days after, couldn't even lift a fork
*I
carried for twenty minutes ><
well, my notebook is quite light here
but that's one of the reasons why I'm looking for a nice netbook - with extended battery life and very lightweight
I have an old toshiba A120
what are you after?
I'm currently looking at the Aspire 1820PT
will be out in a few weeks for around 600 euros
07http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/44b3d8f432/the-button << looooooooool
I like aspire :>
07i mean
07zzz
lol
The Acer Aspire 1820PT Timeline is an 11.6-inch convertible touchscreen ultraportable, packing a 16:9 1366 x 768 multitouch display, 1.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SU7300 processor and optional integrated 3G.
can't view now, no headphonea
s
oooh 3G
around 1.7 kilograms - but 8 hours of battery life
tablet-PC with multitouch even
if the battery endures REALLY THAT LONG, I will grab it as paper replacement for the office ;)
that's your entire working day!
correct
and you can plug it in as well if you must lol
well, that's why I want it: The power supply is extra-weight I don't want too carry around with me all time
as few wires and kilos as possible ;)
gah I gotta go
seeya
/me yawns
gotta go and grab some coffee...

I realised I'm a bit mentally unstable, had a panic attack earlier. Got through the door and at school regardless.

02I've had this Oekaki window open for so long
02lol
02lol
oxymoron incoming Night :P
I was alone in the house. Sometimes I can't stand being alone because I totally lose my rationality, and can end up hurting myself if I move. It's like you get all deluded by irrational fear.
10Eh idk how to further highlight it... wait
02xD
02lol
104:3

02lol
12timey
12microsoft does work
12it works at being a failure
/me runs
But yeah, how do you handle these panic attack things? I don't think I'm too reliable at the moment
and I want to change that
LOL that's self contradicting Umbry
or, to quote Meowth: "We're the best in being the worst!"
02wait what
brb I'll go grab some oreos =)
02I'm only op

hrm - there're quite some hints or trickkkkkkkkks
02xD
02lol
02It's about like...3 days +
02xD
like - hug a specific plush, give someone a call or think about something really wonderful in your life
close your eye, try to remember a moment you were perfectly safe, felt great and were happy
and each time you feel this panic coming over you - remember this very and special moment
remember you got friends caring about you, a world full of wonders, full of dreams, full of potential
02hurr

6My best so far was 1751 words

7Hello all.
4no wait
4hy
4wot do other p think
4 1 sec my head hurts
7what a surprise.
6Let's see
RIP me
6Who do we have here, Mh? ;p
6Someone familiar that is
7oh goodie.
6Lets see, mh... It's on the tip of my tongue..
7it's the goldfish.
7this works only when it's voice-chat Gerple, it says my username. But the meaning isn't lost.
2o.o
7ANYWAYZ, how goes your RPing..ness. of something.
/me pokes teh dead chatot with a stick
6Mhm, doesn't matter to me
6Meh.. I'm nothing near a good RPer, but I'm still improving
2its a dead chatot :o
/me shot
6But yes, my English still isn't good, or well.. Good enough.
7Your english is fine. Better than a CERTAIN roleplayer who I won't mention because you don't know her, who IS english.
7two, in fact. but you know neither of them.
6Mhm, I'm sure I don't know them...
7their excuses are that they're homeschooled and their mums are lazy.
6I'm just glad I'm able to RP with others who are english
6Heh, these are lame excuses...
7It's better than it was.
6If it wasn't I'd suck pretty hard...
7Lol.
7I wouldn't rate yourselves by spyrochat standards; these people are all shit and think they're god's gift to imagination, and you're a pretty meek person so their opinions could well press on you.
6Uhm, I'm sorry... I didn't get all of that...
7doesn't matter lol

2o3o?
...lol Pokemon anime
2lolwuts that?
Capturing ghost Pokemon with nets
2o okay
2fail
6Want to know my how long my longest post so far was?
Apparently it was electrified... with the push of a button. So, uh, Misdrevus could have escaped easily
2o..
7sure, go for it
A young one was once trapped under a tree, too... does the anime not take ghost Pokemon seriously?
6 1751 words
7Nice.
6It was uhm... 7 paragraphs
2I think so
7That's more than a lot of people have in an entire RP, but remember it's quality not quantity.

Anyway, I must go. I have a class in a half hour and need to prepare.
Be seeing you.
6I know
6I was just really inspired by the previous poster
7heh.
6And I guess that my imagination isn't so bad.. It's just htat my english lacks
7 90% of my inspiration comes from music. seriously, I recently made a sonic RP while having New Divide on auto-repeat.
6Lolz, I love to listen to music why RPing
6Gives me inspiration as well
6Only it strongly depends on my mood
6Sometimes hard style gives me inspiration while other times it comes from classic music :\
14Hey
2heya Niau!
6As for now, I really seem to be inspired by different kind of mixes
6Wb Dark
4i hate myself

6XD
9What exactly are you taking about? Lol
6â† Needs to get a life
6CRAP
hi Shiny
I just came from the doc being told I got a metabolic disorder...thanks do my ancestory....
6Or not
Hi Quil
14Metabolic disorder?
yeah
6WTF
14Is that like, really bad?
/list
hi
it's like...well...you become fatter without eating really much and get an increased chance for a heart attack if you don't treat it
14Hey
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAArgh
spynorsk is terrible
Im sorry
but aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I JUST FINISHED MY THINGY. 5mins before deadline z.z
oki
my teacher wont like that
BUT WHATEVER
14Lolspam
nah, good it's been found now
14Right..
Me?
Spam LO
L
that way I get the right medication to solve it
/me hugs
/me hugs back
I missed what was said sorry
just been to the doctor and found out what my problem is in losing weight
6I think I'm going...
Ah...
Losing weight is a pain
>.o I have issues with that too for medical reasons
even if you're having a metabolic disorder - like my doctor found it
so I feel ya
Ahhh, so that's your reason
14I feel fat.
that's why I'll be on pills from now on
14><;;;
mm For how long?
14I'm on Tamiflu
/me 14is shot
well...for....the rest of my life I guess
14o-o
For me it's overproduction of insulin. Insulin 1. regulates the blood sugar (I'm resistant to it so my body makes it en masse) but it also 2. prevents fat from being used as an energy source
so when I work out, it's the carbs and proteins, but not the fat
so it takes forever even with a balanced diet. I don't eat in excess, work out regularly, and try to eat healthily
yeah, well, my problem is thanks to my ancestors
Ah
How so?
I wish I knew who to blame for my issue XD But meeeps
I'm glad they found it
well, such a thing is given by your family in fact
Ah

/j #aqua-vitae
wow
Hiya Arti :>
and hi again/wb
14jgfv
/j #aqua-vitae
Hiya Dari
Hey.
Sup
Not much, you?
Annoyed and bored
Annoyed about what? The game?
yeah got to Volf (Greater Fiend Of Storms) beat him, then got pwnd by about 60 odd of his minions straight after -v-, then refighting him over and over and over, it be highly irritating, and I'm getting bored of the same fight over and over again :/
Hmm.
Volf = Lycanthrope with 4 arms and wields a huge Sycthe
I find it's best to take a break if the game is annoying you, because you just end up doing worse when you get annoyed.
I'm almost at a point of giving up and restarting the game on a slightly easier difficulty :/
Meh, I'd just come back to it later and try again.
Watching something on TV, just call me if you need to talk.
Well the fact that the boss leaves me with little health after the fight is the main problem
07read a guide?
Hm.
Kyu I've tried EVERY guide on the net, neither of them work :/
07lol
Considering none of the guides are for the hardest difficulty
07you made it sould like you only read 2 guides
07o3o
I read about 4 actually
07then say none, not neither XD
Bah
I might go back and try beating the game on Path Of The Mentor difficulty (Hard)
because Path Of The Master Ninja (Expert) is really like impossible (almost)
Or I might go to the Path of the Acolyte (easy) 8D
07I was assuming that was Path of the N00b, but ok...
/me runs
/me slaps Kyu
07oww
07fat hand D=
07wing, whatever
07o3o
To be honest Ninja Gaiden 2 was pretty tough on all difficulties
It's the only game I call a proper challenge XD
Ello
14'w'
Has any of you played Fable 2
14No.
It is the best game ever
can you imagine how wonderful it is when the pain you suffered all day finally fades?
/me pokes the chat
14I guess. owo
such an awesome feeling....impossible to describe
6Waaohhh ;o
6Crowded much? ;3
...
2I do hope that was sarcasm XD
7"There will be 500 people, but no conversation!" "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
6O_O'
6PEOPLES
6"Threehunderd people and not even one fucking engeneer?..."
2...Are you intending to spend time talking about no conversation between the 9 people on here?
/me 6hugs everyone
/me 6huggles back
/me 2glomps C7.
/me 6is glomped
6http://embed.mibbit.com/smileys/yel06.png
2hoho
/me 7slices off stacey's legs, just to see if they'll roast quicker like that
I have never played the first one
2...
/me 6continues her Voldemort
6o-o'
/me 6re-attaches them to Stacey
The second one was good, but the final boss fight was a let down :/
6This is made of epic
2Thank you dear. XD
ya I know
That's why I disliked the game
7...
7riiight.
6XD
6No problem.And you will get to keep them as long as you don't say lolRUS
I was like: FEAR MY SWORD! *Hits with sword* Boss: X_X
2lolRAWR
6http://embed.mibbit.com/smileys/yel06.png Happy Feet
7lolrus!
7whoo!
I shot him
lol
2SHTICKERSH
Witch thing did you wish for?
6o.o
I was like "Yay final boss :D *pow*" Boss: "oh crap *dead*"
2Omg who remembers the whole cherry cock incident?
Money XD
6Guthiix!!
6O_O
/me 7blinks as stacey takes off some random person's ears. "Shielding + nanobots = invincible ears. and legs too."
6Wtf
My doggie
7heh.
6CHESTERELLA?
7and yum-yums.
2I saw the word nano and instantly thought of how much I hate my iPod
2Chesterella!
i so didn't like him killing my dog
2Yeah, yum yums have icy on them
6Oh ya..Yum-yums=sticks with Icy on them!
2What a terrifying though
2thought*
6XD
7donuts with icy on them
I wanted revenge but meh
6VOLDY FTW
One shot killed him I was like "WTF!"
6o.o
2Except, she is NOT pervacious
A bandit was tougher than him!
Wait
A beetle was tougher!
I know... Mabe it was cuz he was like 80
7teehee. pervacious. fun-sounding word.
6Well that is not THAT much
2LOL.
6XD
I was expecting a tough fight
Man was I disappointed
So yeah I never played it again
2Well, she is not on msn so I cant ask her about anything
6Addicted much, eh?...
/me 6continues Voldy
plus the fact that the game was WAY too easy
6Indeed
Fable The Lost Chapters (OR fable 1) had more challenges
And many fun bosses
Actually I still play it cuz of the quests you can do after the main story line
That and the lost chapters version and a dragon as the final boss 8D
/me 7wants to re-write I'm On a Boat to become dragon-related for l0lz, but cba
had a dragon**
6HE'S DONE
I think the hardest boss was the big shard at the end
6O_O
6BUt loos SO shitty
Meh I found that quite simple to be honest
6*But looks SO shitty
2o_O
6Well it does!
But yeah give Ninja Gaiden 2 anyday 8D (though the game annoys the hell out of me XD)
The gosh darn spire gards kept beating the crap out of me!
XD
6Now,the final touch: scarlet eyes!
6brbus
I named the dog in the game
6Back
6I'VE KILLED IT
lol
I named it jack, after my real dog
6O_O
6YOU BASTARD
2...
6Thankus (:
12Orly?
6Woo

7L4D2 is pointless. only a year after L4D1 and it doesn't even add much new. so you got some fireammo and new zombies. big deal, wanna fight about it? it should be an add-on, as oposed to a stand alone game.
6I knew it!
7or even released slowly as free content for L4D1
2Like an expansion pack for the sims!

7new sonic and his harem of anthromorphic sidekicks is getting pretty stupid. limit it to sonic, tails, knuckles and shadow because shadow is bad-ass and needs a MORE VIOLENT GAME.
14I thought it was late for you.
/me 6wants to hug her Twitter BG
6Well..it is really.. :P
2>.=.< i hate the new sonic crap.... He was good in 1 and 2 and once they started adding things that didnt do crap *nuckles is like 1 foot on the like of ok and the other part is out* is really pissing me off

07it's about the placement exams
07how exactly is that gonna go?
6so my post was the first one to have people sleep, but my characters were essentially the last to do so :P
6Kyu, I'll explain in the post before it
6I'm trying to figure out how to word it in the best possible way
07well I was planning on mentioning that I was an examiner or something in my next post to your chars
7I know.

6I mentioned that the main field is made up of 8 separate fields, meaning 16 people can battle at once. Proctors (teachers or last-year students) will be assigned to the fields and watch the battles. For sake of the RP, there wont be any specific assignments for housing (people can choose the house for their characters)
6You'll see my original placement exam plan in the fanfic later on
07so..............yes.
6so, placement exams are testing to see how advanced a person is. The house they're in is based on their form
6yes for what?
12Woah
6 14:54	Kyu	how exactly is that gonna go? <-I answered this

/me then notes Roara is crazy for coming up with that fact
07the battle with (spoiler) on the final day was kinda lame compared to the battle with (other spoiler) that I assumed was going to be the real final one o3o
6Now why does that sound familiar, hmm?
YES. FINALLY.

07ya
07XP
6yes and no
6I don't have volume :P
07lol
6these speakers are buggy for some reason
07aw
05my speakers are really weird
4I like how the seagull keeps going back to do it again
05hai
6hmm
lolhi
6Can't decide what kind of animal to use for these fakemons 3o
6o3o
07oh
07i know
6I've already got a deer for the grass starter
07use a...thing...
07with..stuff...on..it....
6Hmm...
07or something...
6A pill bug? Ovo
6......
6ew
07not for a starter lol
6a bug type for a starter no
6I like pill bugs IRL, lol.
07maybe a 1st catch pokemon
6I do too
6but not as a starting pokemon
07oh! oh!
07for the water type
07a whale.
6Bears came to mind. o.O
07whale.
07WHALE.
6Water --> Waterbear --> Bear.
6....
6wtf quan
6Wat?
6waterbear?
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbear <-- Picture warning.
6But they're awesome little things when it comes to survival.
07i'd have to say it would have to be something that looks good in blue as well
6that looks like the twilight parasite in LoZ: Twilight Princess
07starters are always the colors of their type
6ovo
6Though something blue...
12I was trying to find Pokemon that weren't the colour of their type recently, there aren't veru many :>
12Gulpin's one
07lol
6We have a turtle, a crocodile, a mudskipper, and penguin as water starters.
07that's why I said starter o3o
6I want something that's not bipedal
07since there's no exceptions in that category XP
6Hmm, a snake?
12hey
6pun o-o
/me 6runs
12D8
/me 12licks vulcan.
6A squid. ovO
6Meh, it also has to be something cute-sy.
07it also has to work on land lol
14<3
6Raccoons randomly came to mind.
6I had an super old design from ages ago
6but idk
/me 14returns with a lick
6But, lol, that's already used.
6river otter, but again, used
6A heron?
6idk about using a bird
great heron?
6it would make a good midgame catch
they're great.
6Okay...
07it can't be dual type from the start either
6bulbasaur
6What about Bulba--ye
6but that wasn't a big thing
6Yush, that.
6poison is minor
it was a BULB
-asaur
07poison was an exception o3o
6A frog came to mind.
6Meh, whatever I'm thinking of, I'll just say.
6hmm
07the Poli line
6well, I consider bulba's line to be a frog
6but as a water starter
6perhaps

Your mom sleeps at 7:30?

I don't use my headphones, not even this late (12:44 AM)
:P
6xD
I'm so tempted to turn up my speakers

I like my ears to be owned by loud music :P

04ahh
I play my drums without ear protection
6I do and don't
04but you still had a year of practice...
6if it's quiet, I'll have quiet music

I was going to buy Fast and Furious 4 from Future Shop for about $24, but at Best Buy it was $15

The next day Future Shop had it for $15 as well

12i got a really bad tooth ache
04D:

04Oh-geeze, I had that yesterday X_x
07bisquick is just the mix of flour and other stuff that you're supposed to mix together when making stuff
07just premixed
07XD
04Which makes it awesome :P
6yeah, but compared to other mizes
6mixes
6it's not as good
6sodium content is a bit higher
6but also something in there makes it sweeter too
04Well, yeah, but oh, well. Nothing man-made is perfect :O
6...
6the higher sodium is what makes it good :O
6and I need browned butter for the recipe too
6and it has to be special Costco brand
6because that stuff is loaded with salt too
04I have enough salt in my diet -.-'
07lol
/me 6is probably the most picky butter eater you'll ever meey
6meet
6pkstar

12Then it was "Ok now they've been restored"

4Arti isn't a furry and never has been, and death to all of them.
4So she'll say xD

2I could give a summery of Alice in Wonderland, but...
What do you mean?
2Don't think I should here XD
O_o;
4Actually you're right, he is out of touch with how normal people live their lives...
4Like most political party leaders I guess.
They never gave us a referendum. Meh.
4They never taught us politics in school and I still don't really understand it, but I try to.
4They taught us useless stuff like they wore sandals in the middle east in biblical times.
O_o
politictc is a waste of time
we need a dictatorship
simple as that
12lol
4lol - baiting doesn't work here.
the general public are too stupid to know whats good for them, so democracy fails
Democracy fails mainly because they never give us any say in things anyway.
we dont live in a democracy anyway
we live in a republic
lolwut
I live in the UK.
that's it
we vote for a leader to make choices for us
we dont get to actually chose what happens
so do I
Lol, it is a democracy.
when was the last time you got to vote on a law or act of parliament?
4They make promises before the election and then forget about those promises when they're in power...
Or, it's supposed to be.
never
therfore its not a democracy
That's what they call it, so that's what it is.
no, it isnt
Brown: We promise a vote on the EU referendum
two years later: Oh wait I changed my mind
-_-
07democratic republic actually o3o
no
4They made Ireland vote again because they said no and they weren't satisfied with their answer.
^
/me facepalms
if I call a weed a rose, is it actually a rose?
That was messed up.
why are we talking about this
no. its a weed
we do not have a democracy
4We don't need a dictatorship either, that's much worse.
4But I respect your opinion.
2wb Sky
we should have hitler back, he knew what was good for the country
4wb
Pilands :3
4Erm, I had ancestors die in that, that's not fair to mention it.
The point is, the politicians say it is a democracy, therefore we should get what is meant by that, in other words, a say in decisions made.
4I know you though, you like to do stuff like that xD
why do you say that?
wb
4Hitler killed millions of innocent people, that's not admirable.
no, Im in the UK. And I say that because, despite doing a lot of awful things, hitler was a FANTASTIC leader
4-_-
you nazi. get out of this IRC
when he was in power, 0% unemployment, a booming economy and he was a fantastic spokeperson
4Tier no one wants this kind of hate talk please.
I mean, he managed to convince and entire nation, that Jews were the source of all evil
and that they were superhumans
its not hate talk
07direct democracy is pretty terrible too, you know o3o
have I condoned anything he did?
Lol, actually, booming economy for a couple years, then all the repercussions of his screw-ups hit the economy.
07California has no money because we never vote on a tax raise
07no one ever would lol
the fact was, yes he was an evil man, and yes the wart and holocause was an atrocity, but he was a fantastic leader
4You said he was a fantastic leader, he wasn't, he had the blood of millions on his hands.
He was a good speaker.
if he hadnt kicked off WW2, he could have been the greatest leader Germany, if not the world, had ever seen
4He shouldn't be spoken about in a good way though...
But he only managed to convince them of those things because they were exceedingly poor, and starving at the time.
beto: hitler wasnt the only evil person
They were looking for an easy way out.
4It's not like he deserves it, but yeah you're entitled to your opinion.
And he supposedyly presented one.
I nuked your mom :/
supposedly*
britain BURNED AN ENTIRE CITY TO DUST, including its innocent civilians
4Tier why have you come in just to promote hate? :(
4It's ok though.
leadership skill says NOTHING about motives or beeing a good or bad person...
Im not promoting hate, Im pointing out facts, thats all.
2That's what war is
I love the way I point out something to you and get ignored.
4But you're being hateful?
we dont need to know and this is not a place to discuss this crap
07I don't consider it hateful o3o
4Fair enough.
12It's just a frikkin discussion
CAN WE PLEASE CHANGE THE TOPIC?!
4Yeah I agree, this is disgusting.
07Napoleon was pretty horrible yet he was a good leader too
12*sigh*
what you guys seem to forget, is "popular history" about war is written by the winners or wars.
at least someone is getting the point, thank you dari
12and I agree, Hitler got SO many people to do what he wanted!!
12He got SO many people to listen!!
2I didn't disagree
"History will be kind to me, for it is I who write it." <--- Winston Churchill.
Something like that.
like I said, he managed to convince an entire nation that they were a super race, deserved to own the world, and that the holocaust was a good thing
For I intend to write it
I think it was him, anyway.
hey, who has mario kart wii? maybe some of us can race.
that takes some pretty freakin 1337 leadership skillZ
12Tier, they think you mean that he was a good leader for everything he did -v-
Yes, he was good, but you have to take into consideration that the people were desperate at the time.
German people already liked dictatorships.
/me sighs
And were starving, and poor.
this is getting way to far now
12Wtf, can you PLEASE tell me what's getting too far?
Hitler gave them an 'easy way out', being desperate they took it.
about the victors writing history, the French were said to have taken plaques off the Berlin victory monument that leads down the road from the brandenburg gate during the occupation by the war victors
12Are we not allowed to talk about history?
yes the versaiis treaty was kicking thier ass.
because it featured a war in which Germany beat the french apparantley
sorry, arti.
12No I mean it, please tell me what's so offensive?
I just dont like to hear about hitler
Did you notice how in The Lion King scar was modelled on hitler? leading the oppressed starving hyenas to victory with the promise of food and a united nation.
Apparently most of the time he ignored important things he should have dealt with, and stayed in his bed all day.
12It's not what he did..
12Thats what we're trying to say
12It was his personality
ok
2He wanted to be an artist 8D
sorry for complaining
12o.o
also! Hitler didnt kill himself in the bunker like everyone originally thought!
2He killed himself? I don't remember that...
the skull the soviets have kept locked away for so long had recently been DNA tested
turns out it belonged to a 30ish yr old woman
LOL
/me remembers the titanic game on windows 95 where the best ending had you preventing WWI, WWII, the Russian Revolution and Hitler became a famous painter because his painting was the only object saved from the ship
you could prevent all the modern 20th century wars, but you couldnt rescue the TITANIC
07lol
come on game developers lol
2I'll never let go!
12Unless it breaches the rules
/me is shot
12lol wow...
12O___o
2Oh, I was never taught that XD
"History is a lie commonly agreed upon" Napoleon
I like that quote.
all the soviets found were two fragmented skeletons, which have always been believed to been hitlers and eva braun's
so, nobody really knows what happened to hitler
12Wow!
he might even be still alive
12LOOOOL
12Could the scientist be mistaken I wonder?
Doubt the still alive; he'd be over 100, I believe
2Almost
How would Hitler have hidden?
12He probably changed his identity
shaved his mustache
12my name isn't hitler
12it's nitler :D
2XD
12LOL
it's ok. arti. and I understand.
12Who knows
Even without the famous mousache, he is recogniseable.
2It wasn't me!
o__O
Shave his head.
Some convo
Wear a cloak.
Werner Von Braun and the sort
lol Nick
12Well Im glad that clear but RN still thinks that Tier supports Hitler's evil ways
'My dream was to reach the stars, but I fell short and hit london instead'
Vun Braun...
"What did you do?"
"I made the superweapons that terrorised london!"
"War criminal!"
"I'll help you beat the soviets."
lol
"Welcome to the good side. That whole blowing up london... don't worry about it."
12hehehehh
My favourite Bush quote "One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror".
epiclol
12.........
my favourite bushism is "does anybody actually ask the question, is our children learning?"
12Hahahaha
or "I think war is a dangerous place"
LOL
12Oy..
"Our enemies are resourceful, and innovative, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we"
such a cool guy
07"Oh, no, we're not going to have any casualties."
/me runs
"They misunderestimated me"
2I read that as "misunderstood"
Lol.
I love the one, because he doesn't even realise he's made a mistake.
That*

:D
:P
07"I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it...I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...I don't want to sound like I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one."
07o3o

"I didn't pay enough attention in English class when I was a kid"
/me shot

/me glomps Skylands

12It's ok, they rejected me as well
12But I'm glad they did :D

Idk if the services are to blame

07lol what a waste of money o3o
jesus
money > sense
o_O?
or would that be money < sense
Hm
12It's not, because you keep them for life AND they sell for far more than that.
I fail at maths
07Articuno
12It's an investment, but we'd probably not sell it
/link
/connect
07Ah ^^
its... a number plate
Your server is up...?
12Yeh, don't you know how much personalised number plates go for?!
its not an investment Dx
12Obviously not then :>
When did you load it up?
07about 50 bucks in the US to get your own
/me runs
12My parents one is worth LOADS because it says the word "tap"
how many other Xai foxes are there!
xD
12It's not the X41, it's the fox
12Fox is a last name
god people suck
12That is what makes it so valuable
12We probably wont even win it at that price!
Try restarting-ok :P
/restart
fail D:
12But it's the most we can afford right now LOL
07Meeps
07How goes?
07o3o
07Im good!
havent you got better things to spend the money on? Dx
12not right now, no
07so let her at it :P
12and even then, if we don't get this, we lose it forever
12Unless Mr. Fox wants to sell it some time in 50 years :/
XD
07heh
07Anyway Im good
07sleepy but yeah fine
I was started to get concerned, I was working on it all last night

Firewalls :|
just go to the DVLA and BUY a custom liscence plate XD
only costs £230
12Thats not an investment, and you can only have certain numbers/letters ofcourse
and seeing as youre bidding a grand on this one, you could buy 4 custom plates!
Win
12We cannot ever have XAI FOX
12Or XA1 FOX
Yep
12Anyway we've already bid :3
12Dunno when it ends but I hope we get it LOL
Ok so

07well that's the stock market o3o
12<lste>
Ok I'll shut my entire server down
12Yeh, and one grand is WAY less than that lol
12*late v-v
12plates normally go for 2-3000
12When they have certain things on them anyway

10lugia@hooh
:3
>:3
10why does that sound like a contradiction, and why do Anon + :3 look wr- oh god a lion get2car|
haha
Hm
so it must be something in your settings...
i got Killing Floor today
funfunfunfunfunfunfunfun
include "aliases/anope.conf";
do you have that?
XD
Well that explains it
With that, you can delete every other alias in unrealircd.conf
for services
Then rehash and it'll work.
ok
/cs lol
brace for epic fail
:D
nevermind
Lol.
at least that is fixed ^^
You can also remove the link block for the services :P
That wasn't it
10eh?
10ahright
when i kicked a bot
it would join then rejoin then rejoin
forever etc
like the motd?
10yeah i saw it. i remembered it.
10hence the ahright
augh, I hate getting all girly and stuff today. x_x
07XD
eh? :P
07what for?
my cousin's official wedding ish today o3o
the Korean wedding ceremony was yesterday~
I also need to give you the opers block
07lol~
I'll need yours too, so I can make you an oper on the main one
back
07prove it.
Lack of mode O when I joined
o.o
4+=1416.51.434=+ * Rejoined channel #opers
:/
Oh ok
/motd
services were down
The server is in a working condition.
But no link blocks are set up and all that good stuff
:P
Yep
k
Do you have a domain?
It's not on, though
:U
Ah ok
lolhow? XD
I had to re-extract the files because of a bug (literally and figuratively)
akldfasdfj gtg now
07XD
07kbaibunneh
o-o
The server computer is screwed up
:|
It doesn't save settings 'n' stuff because of some stupid error.
So I try to keep it on most of the time
The new one will be on all the time
?
No, the one your on now
hfvgoighraeoighiosdfg
I scrapped up enough parts at school and outfitted an old one
Ah.
I got my server computer from a friend :D
No more wi-fi server :D
Heh, I thought I was gonna get a computer from the school
Mine's on wi-fi, but I need it to be that way
But turns out they are so tight, they won't even part with a windows 2000-based PC.
wtf @ Tier's IP?
Well, the wifi was only part of the problem
IfILikeYou@82-33-2-121(etc..)
The other one had viruses I thin
what kind of ISP is that? xD
and my parents used it and they would turn it off at times
07that's not the isp lol
My school has a drawing for super-old computers
And my middle school's tech teacher gave me a computer the last day of school.
07the stuff before the @ is whatever you put in on mirc as your email address o3o
It was horribly old and I ended up giving it to a friend of mine (not the same one that I recieved my server from)
I think
:P
But yeah.
I could have picked up an IBM from 1994.
Something tells me it wouldn't work so well
Old as in Win98 (and possibly 95)
07anyways
I think it was a 333 Celeron
I don't remember, though.
/me bunnehbunnehbunnehbunnehbunneh
o.o
This one was a pentium 2
i think
I got some RAM as well, but it didn't fit
usually the ISP is in the IP I find when ppl join/quit chat
I know I had a 2 sister laptops that were 333 Celeron and 300 P2
Check before you try
:|
Probably took SDRAM?
I took DDR
Ah.
Like my server computer and my parents' computer.
The server is now run on a 2001 HP
I took it outside and blew it out with a leafblower.
It looked like it had snowed
That's amazing Arti ^^
Mine's an '04 (or so) Gateway
lol.
I used to have an '01 HP
12Spent all day on this, and I've been working on it since August >v<
But I sold that to the friend that I gave the old compy to/
The '01 HP was WinME based.
This one was one of the first XP PCs
I'm running Server 2003 on it now
looks really amazing :)
12AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm just running XP Pro on mine
Too lazy to care about server.
12EVERY FRIKKIN TIME I UPLOAD MY ART, I NOTICE THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING
o.-.O
12No matter HOW long I spend looking to see if everything is perfect
/me uses XP on EVERYTHING.
12As SOOn as it goes on DA, there's one thing I've forgotten
I should try intalling it on one of my cats...
Which is?
Also, server port?
lolz
a watermark in it?
Uh
Link, as in.
Yeah
for linking
Use 5000, if that's Ok
I'm assuming you have an allow block
Ok
I'm ok with exchanging the oper blocks
I do, but for what? :\
</lol>
If that's OK with you, of course XD
o__O
12No not that
Late, but wow Arti
12^^
07Yay
07My mum found arrow on facebook and added him XD
07arharha

/me pounces RN
4Hi all, apologies for leaving earlier.
12Andrew it is but I'm too used to the PS2 controller
4I didn't mean to say anything bad, I was just...well, no excuse really.
12I cannot get used to Xbox at all
4Just I'm easy to wind up, let's put it that way, sorry guys anyway.
12It's ok, I was hoping you'd come back so I could explain that Tier didn't mean anything like Hitler was a good leader for doing what he did..
4Nah...I'm sorry if I upset him or anything although that's unlikely, he is usually okay with people saying stuff back.
12He just meant Hitler was good at leading, all those people who got to listen to him and all the people he influenced
4I wasn't upset just I had to leave, lest start drama.
12ohh
/me pwnces RN
12Ok
4That's find I understand now.
wb RN
12pwnces lol
4I did some thinking about it.
4lol
4I just wish I could apologise to Tier but he's gone now.
4I think he will be okay.
12He doesn't care, you know him -v-
12He doesn't care about anything >v>
12I really frikkin hate him sometimes LOL XD
4Yeah still...I feel sorry for people I argue against, can't help it.
12Not literally but you know what I mean
4As in, I always think I've annoyed them.
/me 4lays back down
4Yeah, I know a few people like that, but then again people maybe think it about me and stuff I've said in the past here...
4Oh well.
12ANDREW ARE YOU THERE?????
4If he is, he's now deaf.
I hate donuts
4If a real Articuno shouted like that in the UK, there would be a blizzard all the way to India...

and Pizza
and Spaghetti
4I used to really hate mushrooms now I like them...weird.

4lol
I like Mushrooms although they really dont taste of anything
4I think Quavers taste of mushrooms and not cheese they they are meant to.

12LOL Nick, you have to taste Krispy Kremes if you hate donuts
12They'll change your view on donuts forever
07yeah lol
07I don't like how most other donuts taste o3o
4I like those 'yum yums' - I wish they had a better name
Lol yum yums
4It's too embarrassing asking for a yum yum in the bakery...
Lol I don't usually care XD
4I don't think they even have a proper name
I was being sarcastic Arti xD
4I love churros but they don't sell them here and I have no idea how to make them properly.

4Can anyone answer me a question about commissions?
what about RN?
4Is it ethical to keep the person who commissioned you waiting a year and continually making excuses, and refusing to give the money back? Plus would it be ethical for me to start a dispute on paypal over it, because I keep getting lame excuses?
No, and yes :|
Imo
4They did a sketch for me and never finished, and that was November last year...
4they have made numerous excuses...and kept saying 'it will be ready after my exams' etc...
I'd tell them you will if they don't finish it within a month or so...
/me 4wakes up and starts to eat an orange
4oh wwll, will ask them one more time and say I'll start a paypal dispute if they don't co-operate.
4I paid for two pictures, only one got sketched.
4Well, they are a friend of a best friend of mine, so this is very out of character.
That's lame :\

4The one about the carbon monoxide.
what happens in it?
One of my friends regularly steals them from the breakfast line
My school is full of bums like that :D
4well, I think it's a bit too bad to say here.
4It pushes the message anyway.

whaa

/me facepalms
My Physics teacher gave me a booster pack of Pokemon cards for getting an A on a test
Heh, I'm gonna remove all of that example.conf stuff in the conf.
XD
He's crazy.
4Well, they show two people in a bed and kids' toys flying about and there's smoke everywhere, and it says 'if you don't test your smoke alarm you'll breath in all the toxic smoke and it's just like drowning' - now, I don't know why I find it creepy when I'm okay to watch horrors.
That's actually kinda awesome.
Also, I'd never heard of a vhost block before today
o-O?
07My computer
07had a spaz moment
You have one in the conf

4Yeah
07I didnt do it in main chan did I x,x
Oh for an example

:/
4I don't think so, and it would have been apparant you didn't mean it if that happened.
I don't think I've seen that advert you know..
O_O_o_o_._._o_o_O_O
4It's really creepy, you kind of 'don't want to see that'.
07(\/)
07(._.)
o no u d'in
4I suppose it does make you think about it though.
o yez i di'

Huh
4I've got the link, but obviously won't post it.
I thought I had to approve them...
I guess I don't watch enough tvs
Through hostserv, you do

4I'm glad I don't copy behaviour from my parents sometimes, some things they do
10o-o
10o3o Glad you don't
what block stuffs do I need to add?
My parents constantly fight
12I think we're all glad we don't copy ALL of our parents' behaviors, RN...
4They're both okay for the most part, but when they were arguing over the house before, stuff like that happened.
4LOL like liking oldy singers
if i was to copy my mom's behaviour...
oh wow
12lol RN
she is just... airheaded

my dad believes i should be some sports star or something

4My dad was a sea captain so he got his qualifications in that.

2LOL
02loldamnit
02I hate you
bleh
2Y'see, you asked for a pokemon that wasn't as popular, and the majority chose porygon so it would've been wise to go with dunsparce
02I hate you
2I like its roundness
Didn't work out as planned.
2XD
02xD
2Nah, I went with !battle
12lol Shiny
Try again.
/superadmin on

2Dunsparce used to be one of my fave pokemon
/super-admin
/me hides
2Porygon: tie, tie, win
12o.o
...?
2Smeargle: loss, win
2Dunsparse: tie, tie, loss
2Dunsparce: Epic, win
/me shot
no
2o3o how guess the battle sequence
>:O
02no u
2Hint: each one is in order of their own battles
12O.o;
/os help svsnick
02no u
2??
/os Super Admin on
02stop using Altair's vHost! >:{(
/me hides
how 'bout no
02how about yes
02:U
no.
12o.o?
02yes.
2:P math
I don't wanna.
02Yes you do.
/os set superadmin on
Nope.
2Porygon and Dunsparse each have two ties, therefore, they must have battled each other and tied twice
02Yep.
Hey, how do you do the super admin thing? :P
12this is Saturday night...
13....
12no need for math x-x
02but i don't think you can do it
2Secret Saturdays
Meh, access denied.
02since it's only for services root for some odd reason
02hm
/me gets enough of THAT during the week...
2There's always need for math
2Smeargle is the only one to have battled twice, while Porygon and Dunsparse battled three times, so therefore, it must have battled them each once
02I don't know what's wrong though
02because it should be for services admins too
02but baww
02wb
Depends on services access
:|
02yes
02but
Not Oper access
/os help
02yeah
02services oper
/os staff
02not IRC op
02o_O
12...
02hm
02that reminds me
/os help
02wait
02what was I going to do again?
Suicide
02xD
/os session
2and The two non-tie scores are last, so therefore, Porygon and Dunsparse must have battled Smeargle one after another
02lol
/me needs ideas for Sprites -.-'
2*one after another, after they battled each other
02:/
02hm
02Draw Leviathan? 8D
2Caleb
If you want to.
02god damn lol
:/
2Smeargle's first score of loss and Porygon's last score of win match up, so therefore, Smeargle must have battled Porygon first
/me doesn't breathe. 8D
/me runs to go look for a Caleb picture
2And so, the last battle would have been Dunsparse VS Smeargle
DRAW LEVIATHAN NAOUGHW.
8D
02lol
2What if a random pokemon came in and battled and that's how one won?
02LEVIATHAN
028D
2So, the order should be P-D, P-D, P-S, S-D
2o3o
Also known as 'just draw a Lugia and say it's Leviathan'
/me runs.
2Shiny, go in #Aethorion and try the script out

Port 6667?
no
7777
02:O
O_o
02why 7777?
6667 would really screw things up
02how?
Altair and I are on 6667.
02:/
wat
02yeah
/me is reminded of Fugue 7777 o-o
02Altair's server is on 6667
Maybe that's what's cauing the problems
/me lies down
02I could try link Altair's server with yours
What problems? O_o
02but yeah
02what problems?
I thought there were problems.
:|
02eh
02those were fixed
Of course the client port is 6667
/me sits
02but for some reason
02that's why i have a double connection lol
02oh dear
02TST is STILL down
Like what do you mean?
02okay
02this sort of thing
2yeah...
02so lol
You're not meant to.
Actually, that is odd.

As far as I can remember.
02yeah
02you should be able to
02reminds me

02I'll talk to Presea
02hm
So there isn't a problem.
02k
02probably the settings
12sadly...
02HoR is up though
/me hides
02though the Oekaki is still down
/umode

2Even when TST is down, HoR still remains quiet
great... my uncle has WoW raids in 10 minutes...
And /globops?
02Shiny
2I think that shows how much people don't like it there
02Our site isn't that active yet
02...
02No it doesn't
2Those who know about the site
02Hey
02I hope that doesn't include me
02Because I do like it
2You were on it for half the time
02I'm still on
2I'm still on it
/wallops
02I am too
lookitup
02And I'm on whenever possible
/me doesn't remember off the top of his head.
02lol
02wallops is like a message to everyone
/me is in HOR's chat almost every day, if that means anything...
02and globops sends a message to all IRC ops
I like it there
Cool.
02so yeah
/globops Let's test that.
Hm.
02was that globops?
Yeah.
2LL, you're on the chat, but not on the site. Though I know you can't handle two sites, right now only one of them is up
12hmm

02you don't have the permissions
02you need to be services admin
02hm
/os staff

02yes you can
02a lot of things
02eh f
12that IS true, Shiny, but when I mean "handle 2 sites", I mean that I can't be a part of 2, or it gets confusing to me...
02nevermind
02I'll show you later
.
02brb lunch
wat.
02And Shiny
02Look at TST

12isn't it enough that I'm on HOR's shoutbox and chat?
/me sniffles
2You're only on the cbox cause I have to be on there
2Idk even why you're on our chat if you can't handle the site
/os help
12Shiny, I can't handle it as a whole...
2Worded wrong -.-'
/os chanlist
12I'm starting to get used to 2 chats at a time
/os userlist
12I know what you were saying >_>
2Judging by the face you don't
12...
12I don't see how you can be annoyed with me by being on your chat...
...
12because thats what I'm seeing
This looks like senseless bickering to me.

02we should have a different services thing
2sorry, drf
02that isn't hosted by the same person
2even though he's not here, but whatever
02so the services stay up even when the first server goes down
02xD
02lol
k
02wb
I can set up for when Altair's goes down if you want?
That Harper's island thing was funny.
02Harper's island?
Yeah.
02yeah
02I think you should set up one
02that's exactly like Altair's
02same permissions and everything else etc.
02but
Does he use Anope, or what?
02yeah I think so
02but hm
Ok.
But?
/me is goin to bed soon
02I wonder if we can host one on somewhere like the internet?
02oshi-
02sorry
02that didn't make sense
2o3o I suddenly have the urge to name her "Byte"
02what's with TST's server though?
02how come the services don't exactly go down or what?
02D=
02nuuuuu

Probably.
2It's only 8 there for you, right?
2no

02don't worry about setting it up
02hm
2o3o

2lol
02lol
Ok.
2yeah
02Shiny
02in your colour thing
02you need to put 0 before your colour number

2o-o
2whut?
02it should be 02
02not just 2
02the bold part
02lolwow
02I just realised how much Altair's server goes down
02Splits are funny
So services don't go down because they are hosted separately.
Can Altair host two separate servers on one computer? O_o
2PorygonZ still scares me X-x
02yeah
2the eyes just make it look like a madman
02I think you should maybe host it lol
2PorygonZ kept killing my partner in PMD2
02since you seem to have a more stable connection
2o-o
Hm, I wonder why Altair's goes down.
02eh
02connection got reset
02it runs on wi-fi
02I think
02eh

2o3o
2there
02don't ask me
02I could try hosting a server
/me 2punches the air
02but it definitely won't be up 34/7
2that should do it O3o
Hmm.
0224/7*

02lol
02xD
I wonder if I can host a server in a virtually run OS.
02lol
02btw
Yes?
Nothing.
You need to give it a raw command.
Raw commands basically let you do anything, so they are dangerous and can screw up the server.
02ah
02well
02looks like Altair's server won't be up for a while, so
02yeah
02I know that

You are the 590,905,457,1.5 richest person in the world! <-- ololol
is that yours?
Note the decimal point
No.
Well, technically maybe yes

You are the 5,742,857,143 richest person in the world!
You're in the TOP 95.71%
richest people in the world!
YES.
If you put in something less than 100, you get higher than if you put in 101 or something
I put in 200
Putting in 1 = 5,780,722,892
Putting in 115 = 590,905,457,1.5
Also note decimal point
In the second one

Ahhh, stop that!
/me makes an EMP somehow, but doesn't use it.
Kyu, please stop.
XD
07point out exactly what about it harms you in any way, then i'll stop
XD
07because it isn't spam
It's spam, Kyu.
Repeating the same word continuously is one form of spam.
exactly
anyone want to hear my story on how I became a cybernetic lugia
07besides, mods are partially exempt from that rule
07considering I can actually spam and not get kicked for it
Isn't the bunnehing in one line though? O-o
Saying "Bunneh Bunneh Bunneh" isn't bad at all
07one line every few minutes isn't overdoing it by my standards
07if it were more often, then yes
Kyu, rule 30.
We want you to stop. You should respect our wishes.
Or are mods exempt from that rule, too?
07that applies to being harassed
that also applies to being annoyed
XD ya
/me notes that as soon as a chat tries to make a "no being annoying" rule, that just promotes godmodding
03That's precisely why #PM akicked me
why hello there drf
>_>
hello
03LOL
lol
how does that promote godmodding? o_O
03because
03You can't define "annoying"
03therefore it's
06Theres always a vocal minority who will be annoyed by everything
03"if we don't like you, we ban you and say you're being annoying"
06thus, "not annoying" rules = waste of time
03which is why I'm in total disfavor of any such rules.
07lol
03because I'm usually considered annoying
ah o.-.o
lol really
drf, checked out the file yet?
07which is exactly why there's nothing wrong with me doing it
03what's annoying to one person isn't annoying to someone else
03Vyl, Nope.
06yeh, drt is a perfect example ;P
DRF, we were asking him to stop. He's the mod here.
Who's "we"? Isn't it just you? O_o;
Me and 365
06see, vocal minority
what?
You wanted Kyu to stop, right?
oh ya
http://vyl.avians.net/misc/pass10.mkv <-- This is the latest version.

sera[off], it's because you're putting 1 message in each users' sendq, so why should 1 user be penalized for adding to 100 users' queue?
of course 1 user will be penalized if he adds to each other users queue manually by PRIVMSG-ing each user
but it doesn't make sense for each user to be penalized for each user in a chan

/me random-pokes a Lyon to say hi
2o-o when?
2oh'
2Sorry, I meant Quil
04?
oh
hi
and you tried all ports you listed, etc?
which IP are you trying to connect to?
07hi
and, now that the firewall is disabled, do you get Connection Refused instead of Timeout as the error for port 6697?
/me sits near Lyon
Yeah, I tried all the ports, and no, still timeout for 6697.
which IP?
*IP address?
Hi?
hi?
HI. AVIS!!!
86.22.93.170
07yes, hi
Hi Quil?
07Avis?
did you first try with localhost?
merr?
yes?
Nope.
prove that it works by connecting to localhost:6667
/me glomps
Ok.
merr?
gtg
and are you behind NAT?
07kk
NAT is disabled.
so your router thing is acting as a hub?
Yeah.
/me sneezes on Guest1108632
/me 2coughs on Guest1108632
may I have the output of ifconfig just for fun?
If you want.
:-)
http://pastebin.com/m400fff64
04I'm gonna play Spore for a while
04Heehee
/me poofs
lol
you just contradicted yourself
?
port-forward port 6667 to your computer if you want people to be able to connect to your server
you definitely have NAT enabled
192.168.* is reserved for ``private use''-ish stuff -- behind NATs
It's already port-forwarded.
your server's IP is different than the IP you gave me, so it is NAT
192.168. is DCHP
but you said NAT is disabled...
The other IP is my external IP.
but NAT isn't disabled...
Which is used for global things, not local things.
It is.
were you able to connect to your server using 192.168.1.106 ?
it isn't
Yes, I am.
if you disabled NAT, you should rerun your DHCP client so that you get a public IP on your server
BTW, it works on a computer running windows with current settings.
a computer on your network?
Yeah.
192.168.1.101
100*
so you can connect to your public IP address when running unrealircd on 192.168.1.100?
Yeah.
?
07hm
07bunnehfoods
I suppose I should stop trying to confuse myself ;-)
12YAY.
12I FINALLY HIT MASTER* RANK. 8D
12It's the rank right above Master Rank.
12They ran out of names.
/me can get Raikou now~
Hmm, I can connect to 192.168.1.106. The same was on the windows run version till I registered a dns.
2o-o
I dunno, I'm using the same dns though, and the windows server isn't running.

/me feels like trying to get more Sigils nao
I get ``connection refused''
7My favorite missions must be the 'fill up the mission gauge' ones. X3

Hi Tanner, Welcome to #Unreal-Support. To get voice, please read the rules at http://www.x-tab.org/~usupbot/rules.html
12Local Wireless only
12that's a little uncool
12its still a GREAT DS game
7Yeah...
12I have a DS lite
12same v-v;
12I'm hoping for a DS i
7But still, if we could play over the internet, it'd be awesome. 8D I'd pick Saix or Sora for multiplayer. o3o
7Though the former's limit is hard to control. X3
12hai Kipi~
'-'
12lol Quan
12I don't get why they are $160
Hullo
/me bunnehs all over a Kipi

12<late>
12Noooooooo...
07Umbreon is gonna pull a hat out of his hat?
07o3o
/me is jealous of everybody who isn't sick. D:<
LOL
7Depends on what you mean by 'best', I guess.
/me b'oxes all over Kyu
12XD
12no, not again!
7Random thought, but Lex's limit can take off a large number of bars off an enemy.
12???
7But the price for that it speed. Everything has a price to pay, lulz.
/me still prefers Xion's
12since you can jump between enemies
12AND the Final Limit hits all close enemies too
7Oh, and speaking of, Marly's limit can kill any enemy instantly. O.o
12O.O
12The pics on this site are gone and I don't know why, I'm using Firefox btw <Late>
07lol that's fitting
/me never got the chance to use Marly's Final yet...
7Yush, the pink-haired guy with control over flowers gets the most powerful limit, if utilized correctly.
12but I have all <Spoiler> Crowns, so theres no need :/
12lol Quan
07I meant fitting for a scythe weilder
07o3o

TAT
7'Somethingâ€¦ snapped. Broke away entirely. He could feel it break, could almost watch as the small, rational portion of his mindâ€”Youâ€™re tired. Itâ€™s an illusion. Your control is shaky because of your concern over Lexaeus and your own sanity. Your power feeds off madness and worrying over madness begets madnessâ€¦â€”retreated back, back behind the walls of absolute
7crumbling madness.'
12wtf?

It's really strange setting up the listen block as "clientsonly" doesn't work at all.
You just get connection timed out.

tbh
Sometimes I SWEAR your server dies less than Altair's
but Altair finally turned off auto updates
which are fail
Lol.
I still hate Windows for using that system of epic fial
fail*
XD
it's really annoying as well
Yeah.
I just cancel it
but then it starts popping up every 5 minutes
-_-
And I actually have work to do lol
I was trying to host the server from within a virtually run Ubuntu OS.
Meh.
I was doing English coursework and that thing kept popping up.
lol
Windows Updates are fail
They should have a better system xD
and Altair is awesome at this
12ah the good old days of game playing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFt2rCLai-M
Yeah, I would have thought that they could come up with something better.

/me hides
Rehash. XD
lol
LOL
yeah Rehash x
D
WAY better lol
Lol.
and instead of making you turn off your computer,...
and I've lost work through the restart thing
because I leave my computer on for about 10 minutes
I hate it. :/
in the meantime, that windows box comes up
makes you restart your computer
and you lose your work
yeah I do too

:P
xD
07yes lol
By the way Kyu why do you keep poking Ronnie o_o
hurrdurr
kk
Just to see if I can, I'm gunna try and make a Flash IRC client. :o
07cuz u is silly for being furry but not using the name more often XP
o_O
/chatops Woot! Power abuse! XD
it's almost impossible
Nah.
and also
XMLsockets. XD
Oh yeah
Almost forgot
can you add port 80 to your IRC?
O_o
so I can connect via port 80?
Ooook. O_o
I need to test something
I'm at school
Ronnie is for FURsites.
Kthxbai.
so yeah, almost all ports are blocked
07lol u pickle
lol
80 is open.
8D
k
Lol, it won't let me connect.
damn
it won't let me either xD
try setting it up again?
HTML port is locked? DX
D:
Because last time Altair added port 8080 on his server for me
he said his server had to go down for a while
try port 53?
You silly bunny.
I'll /die the server and try again.
/die
07lolnice
07you silly...uh...
07Ontarioian
lolwb
07or whatever they call people from that region
07XD
Thank you. XD
/hop
Torontonian.
XD
lol
07the region, not the city lol
07you're all three o3o
I'm in the GTA region.
so it's open now?
Greater Toronto Area, which is a region.
07country, city, and province
07o3o
o_O
I set up a listen on 8080, it works.
But I'm also in York Region...
GAH
80 must be locked.
You're confusing me.
Silly californian.
D=
it is?
:(
07that's mah job
Well the one on 8080 I just set up works immediately.
You're job is to mod, not annoy.
07or at least it would be if I was paid D=
:o
ah
Where as the port 80 still doesn't work.
well unfortunately I can't connect on either of those ports then
I would pay you 5 cents a day
Because all ports are blocked at school
07but...
07I dun live in china
07o3o
They can't be. :P
They are
Or you couldn't connect to the internet, or use certain programs.
You're asian, good nuff.
except for port 80
WAIT!
I can use a program to find out which ports are open.
try 402!
I haz some dodgy programs.
yeah do that please xD
lol
07i'm pretty sure the filipino minimum wage is higher o3o
try 402 first
Oh well.
You're not in the filipenes so you get lower wages
Yeah, it needs to restart
/restart
o-O
k
I'll try now?
07D=
07but...
07I wants 7 cents
/me cries!
O_o 402 doesn't work for me.
Hm it doesn't for me either
Weird.
well
But but
That's 2 cents more!
D=
scan my internet perhaps?
Prr?
Look for any open ports?
07waah
Ok.
Be warned though, our Network Administrator is probably active
You are at school now?
Wah-mbulance
so be careful
yes
So how come you can connect?
CGI:IRC
Oh.
goes behind firewalls lol
g'night
and behind blocked ports xD
07well that was abrupt lol
XD
lol
07lol
6*after watching video*
...The heck with you. I'm a ninja. :)
6...Mildly interesting.
6Very low interest. ;o
14I love her. she's cute. I have a...thing for cute.
Kyu, how will Aurora separate us into houses in the STA RP or do we choose o_o
k
thanks
then how come I see you?
and by careful, I mean CAREFUL D:
Keep in mind, murder is legal if you don't get caught. It's only immoral no matter what.
Yeah yeah. XD
lol hi Syrynn'
You wouldn't get in trouble for one, and I'm not doing anything illegal, so neither would I. :P
No u
/me also prods Kyu with Kyu's shotgun
07I just wrote them down randomly on that page without me actually telling you what you're in
/whois Seran
07you choose what you read on the paper lol
If no one can prove you did it, it's not illegal.
And Kyu, what do I read on the paper?
o_o
lol
O_o
I don't even know what the paper is like...(unless Aurora posts and makes up the paper herself)
well, you just don't want The Hensh tracking you, k?
Scanning.
I'm not sure what he'd do
but yeah
OS scan?
/me peels it off with Adhesive removal :)
07the examiner for your field looked at you, then placed what house you're in next to your name
The Hensh?
07that's what you're looking at
No, port scanning. :P
I'm reading a big 'I'm food' sign on Sky
it's an ink stamp
Hmmmmmm
Like
14x3
The person that's in charge of my field already read my house out?
14buuut, thats me.
ah xD
Our Network Administrator
He likes being called that
Cuz I don't even know what houses there are.
and it's shorter than saying Mr Henshaw xD
07just have whoever it is do it in your next post
07the 3 legend burds
he used to be part of a band called the Cool Dudes
It's gunna take a while, 65000 ports to scan. XD
Arti Molty and Zappy?
07yes
and THAT scares me
Aren't there...more?
6;p
07not this time
it's it 65535 or something? xD
Kk
Yeah.
lol
I just realized I'm listening to horrible DBSK rap.
/me smashes his iTunes!
how long?
roughly
07lolacronyms
Let me approximate.
DONGBANGSHINKIFAIL.
Happy?
k
07uh
07sure?
5 hours.
Or so.
Just went over the houses.
o_O
I'm soooooooo Ice.
/me flails
07lol
Because it takes about 3 minutes to scan 650 ports, which is around 1%
ah....
So 300 minutes for 65,000
XD
xD
well, I'm going to go in about 10 minutes
but I'll be back in about 1 hours
Ok, I'll give you the result when I get them. :P
yeah
14yeeeaaah. x3

The students are already placed in houses, but if their battle style is different during the placement tests, they'll be transferred?

03o/` where's my gangstas and all my thugs, hold them hands and we show some love o/`, man I haven't heard this song in a while
03I have some stuff on my Sansa that wasn't on my zune LOL

6drf
6question in response to my CPU issue
03LOL, what's with the battery meter?
03Yeah
/me notes the huuuuuuuuuuuuuge amount of white space in that0 screenshot
6Malwarebytes Anti-Malware <-that's the name of the program I should get?
03Yes.
6drf, dunno where it cme fomr lOL
6lol
6alright
03It's a free/sorta unfree virus scanner, but it's proven to be the best one ever
6specific site?
03and I mean, it's free but to get real-time scanning you have to register
03Um
03google? LOL, hold oin
03-i
03v
03...
03http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html
6alrght, it's scanning
03o/` I'm just an average man, with an average life... I work from 9 to 5, hey... I pay the price o/`
03halloween music ftw?
/me needs to get his Halloween CD finished and uploaded
6lol what song is that?
03Somebody's Watching Me
6huh
6never heard of it
03you ever seen those Geico commercials? LOL
07LOL
03but anyway, the original was by Rockwell... I hate that though, I like the random third-party cover version I found :)
6OMG THAT SONG
6LOOOOOOOL
03yeah
6nevermind then
03you can actually download that version, too
6that song bugs me
but it has a good bass and stuff
03This is the best version ever.
03I had to edit it a bit too :/
03as the original was like "hey, hell, I pay the price", and we all know my mom won't have it
03so I had to mess around a bit to make it sound like it's just a pause there XD
Aurora, RP question: How are the opponents in placement battles decided? Pre-decided or on-the-spot by proctors?
6pre-decided based on where your character grew up
/me installs like 8 million updates on my mom's new computer
03still, that thing is FTW though, it was a little under $500 and is almost as beastly as my laptop.
03Plus it has an XP disc that doesn't need a serial number, it's just legit out of the box, plus Vistrash for people who actually want that
But if I'm making up the opponent, does it really matter?
6as long as they're from where your character grew up
Okay. I'm making up a Golduck from Canada then.
this is a good song, drf. danke.
/me runs
6by where you grew up, I mean one of the three worlds
03no problem
03I'm gonna put my whole Halloween CD up in the next couple days, hopefully, the 2008 one was missing a few tracks
...Let's just say my opponent grew up in the same world.
>_>
6you wont have a human world person go against someone who's grown up in Bridge
Okay, then my opponent DID grow up in the human world
6major disadvantage
Woohoo
Yeah, I can tell
6hmm, 8 minutes and nothing infected yet
03Malwarebytes does take a while
033-4 hours for a medium sized hard drive
6how long do you think?
6oh
03how big is your drive?
6hmm
Kk Im'ma whoop my opponent's @$$ then Aurora.
6lemme check
6capacity is 70 GB, used is 30
03hm
03on a 70GB hard drive... probably 1.5-2 hours?
03For a 160Gb it usually takes 3-4, so...
6alright I can do that
6I'll be up for another cuple hours
6couple
03XD
07oh yeah
07is there any sort of bonus for the ones that win the match, Roara?
Posted in RP.
Hopefully I didn't mess THIS one up
6not really
6bragging rights?
07lolk
/me 6shrugs
Bragging rights is more than enough for you Kyu D=<
Oh wait, you're not battling.
/me facepalms
07yes lol
6also
Anyways I made myself facing off with a Californian-born Golduck named after my Karate sensei.
6I was talking with the DJ at our church dance last night
I just had to put Californian.
07loool
6he's a really cool guy, showing me his system and such, and we were talking about how awesome "Evacuate the Dance Floor" is (LOL!)
God that song is played every 5 minutes here.
>_>
6but then he put on some music that I'd never heard before and it's REALLY cool
Not that bad but still, repeated is kinda annoying.
Yes.
6It's never played here
LOL
6:|
6I love that song
03LO)L
03-)
6I loop it all the time
Every major channel in Ontario has that song.
03church dances... did they play a bunch of fundie music or something
03?
6I wish our channels did it
6fundie
6?
6wtf is that?
And everytime you tune to a different channel, within 10 minutes you'll hear it.
03like the people who try to shove religion down your throat.
6no o-o
03Jehova's Witnesses are the best example
6the songs that play are usually top songs in the country
EVACUATE THE DANCE FLOOR, I'M INFECTED BY THE SOUND~
03-S
DU-NUH, NUH-NUH
03well it's just weird for a church to be playing real music XD
6we had two of iTunes top songs in the lineup this time
/me goes krazy
6I guess it is wierd to some people, but it's always like that
6"Everytime We Touch", "No Air", "We Like to Party", "Just Dance", "Disturbia", etc
6those kinds of songs
No Air is a dance song?
Oh wait...slow dance.
6we even had "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feelin" last night
03have you heard Just Disturbia?
/me runs
6LOL
6wat?
03it's a mashup
03of Just Dance and Disturbia
Sounds epic.
Don't forget "What Hurts the Most"
/me tries to find a good gift idea for my sister :/
6we didn't have that one actualy
6it did play a few dances ago
6drf, nail polish
/me 6runs
03o.o
03I was thinking more some Disney DVD
03as she's into that crap
6BOLT
/me 6runs faster
6I love that movie
03and meh dances... I don't dance but I've seriously contemplated DJing a dance
03I think I'd be good at it
6I got to DJ before
6not a dance, but I worked the equipment and all
03LOL
6it was sweet
03Forget equipment
03Laptop + Winamp + audio cables + amp/speakers
03Problem solved
I think "Can't Stop the Rain" should be played more
03seriously, people who use CDs are too oldschool LOL
6true, but the school wasn't that cool
6they plopped the equipment outside, hooked up someone's ipod, put in two cds, and started looking for someone who could turn it on
07lol
6I know enough about electronics that it was easy enough, so i worked it
6it was fun
03LOL
I need to bed. I have college
Bye
07my sister had a friend who DJ'd with vinyl o3o
6that would be awesome
07THAT's old school
07CDs are lame
07and computer DJs are lazy
07XD
6ANYWAYS
6What I was trying to say before
6the dj put on this music that was really cool
6lemme see if I can find it
I'm so lost just because I'm not into DJ-tech-stuff.
I'm a dancer, not a tech whiz
>_<
03I'm the reverse.
/me runs
Kinda evident :P
03anyway, VCAST Song ID FTW?
03I've found out several songs that way
Why do I have a feeling I'm also lost because I'm -18?
And hey Cynder
6isaac, given the chance, I bet you could figure it out
6it wasn't hard
/me sighs
12I just had a spasm. TvT
That's the thing, I never get the chance.
/me forgot to change her color Ovo
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjdK0_0YqKo&feature=related this doesn't sound like the song I heard, but I really love this one too
06There.
You just had a spasm, like mental or physical?
o_o
06Um...
06I dunno.
6Sleepthief, one of my new favorite bands
6music composers, whatev
...Music artists?
/me runs
6yeah sure o3o
/me sulks in Zexion's emo corner
Er, your insides freaked out Cynder?
6geez isaac, you already went through the entire battle o3o
06Yes.

/me runs
06...?
6oh wait
6Isaac
6they reveal your house AFTER the battle lol
.........
6in case your battle style forces you to be switched
[00:15] The students are already placed in houses, but if their battle style is different during the placement tests, they'll be transferred?
I blame him.
6why?
6that's right
/me listens to Rnw@Y
6for that reason, they wont tell you what house you're in until after the fight
06...
06This isn't cheering me up. D=
Goshdarnnitfigglesauce.
/me listens to Bodies
06Why can't I listen to something more cheerful?
/me throws lots of Lucarios and Lugias at Cynder, as well as a Faerie Paintbrush

06TvT

06Along with their emoticon versions. >v<
6butbutbut

6I thought I did, but I probably worded it super weird
07it was yesterday that I asked lol
6..
6see what I mean?
07you said 'placed by their type' and 'changed if their battle style doesn't match the house'
6k

6well, I guess to fill in what you missed

02o_O
02that's true
02Javascript is a freaking pain
02k
02Python is awesome though 8D
Yeah a real big pain, I am having so much trouble with it but it is basic programming so I gotta learn it
02lol
02I really don't want to learn it
02so I just stray away from it
02and just copypasta and edit codes
I am more of an artist or writer
02editing javascript isn't too bad
02but coding from scratch is a huge painn
02>.>
02Ah lol
YAH!
6sdjhfid geeeeez
02yeah
6that stuff STILL smells bd
6bad
My socks?
6my dad used soe kind of sulfate used in his wine
6the stuff is the strongest scent I know
02o_O
02lol
6It literaly HURTS to smell
07lol
02:/
6I walked into the kitchen where he was using it, and my nose felt like it was ripping apart when i breathed it in
6of course, I'm more sensitive to smell than everyone else I've met
I'd rather get a Ferow's drill epck in the butt than smellt hat
6so my dad was like "wat the heckis wrong with you?"
Fearow
What OS do your school computers host?
Windowd XP?
Windows*

Hey, what's your IP address at school?
02uh
153.107.33.154?
02yes
02maybe try an OS scan
02it's much faster
02and yields better results
OS Scan?
02yeah
What's that?
02eh
02nvm
Hmm.
Logging packets sent.
02hmk
02also
02what program did you use?
203.102.47.246 is what comes up when you type.
It doesn't have a name, it's just some program in something call net tools 4.
Also 74.242.238.162 comes up.
02o-O
02that's Altair's IP
O_o
02and I can't find your IP
02wait nvm
Maybe because when you say something it also sends it to him/
02yeah
02use nmap to OS Scan
02http://nmap.org/book/inst-windows.html
203.102.47.246 comes to s0295706496-dsl-gw.aspac.customer.alter.net
O_o
Oh, net tools has nmap
Which obviously isn't your hostname.
XD
Are you still at school?
02lolno
02eh
Oh, so that's why the IP changed. XD

So double click that, click propeties, click wireless ---- tab, and double click the connection you're using.

You done that?
then..
yep
It should come up with a window with all the network details in it.
yes
then?
What does it say your IP is there, the same?
Nevermind, said the wrong thing.
lol
Close it, then when you double click the icon, on the window that comes up click the tab "support".
Then click details.
yeah
Should come up with IP, DNS, etc.

Hi Aurora
Hiya
lol 365
you need your page
what?
???
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=4305
So
12hello
ro-ro-ro-roara without a %
06...
06wat o-o?
06oh right
07identify
12OvO
07lol
06How do I identify automatically?
06when I join
/whois Aurora
What are you using? Because I don't know how if you are using mibbit.
06mIRC
dah, I just wanted to ask cuno something
06lol
You could go to the settings, then click the options tab.
Click perform.
Click add, then scroll through the list, and add this network.
I just have that set up for all Networks.
much more reliable
In what way?
It does the same thing, just only for this network.
You can set it up to do it only for this network anyway, lol.
06awesome, that worked
if all mIRC setting return to default for whatever reason there you've just got to reload the script
perform is easier imo
12imo?
also, I prefer script as it's much easier to see what it's supposed to do. I don't trust premade things like that if I have a choice
Did you make your own IRC client then? :o
No, because that would be too complicated
I'm sure I could though
Maybe I could try that ...
You can make one with 20 lines or so in PHP. XD
hi
Hullo
that's because someone else will have created all the protocol programs and such for you
Nope.
All from scratch, 20 lines.
:P
12lol
the IRC protocol is simple but it won't be possible in 20 lines
/me burns the Xbox360
It is really that simple, lol.
/me runs
You'd have trouble getting connect/disconnect systems working in that much
Hmm, closing it disconnects you, but yeah, setting up connect you'd have to change it manually if you wanted to connect to a different server.
Quincunx?
My bot is an implimentation of IRC client in perl.
No, I mean, getting the system to actually handle the talking to the server about ACTUALLY CONNECTING, would be difficult in that few lines
What do you mean? Getting it to connect to a server is one line.
using protocol already made for you
Yeah, but you're using something already made for you unless you make your own language completely.
Let me find it, I'm pretty sure it's just one line, although setting up information beforehand doesn't count.
It's just the line to connect I'm talking about.
Vyl, I believe he's saying PHP has a built-in function to do all that for you
No, the socket function.
which is the same thing ...
What are you saying? As I said unless you are planning on making your own langauge it doesn't matter.
Sockets are built into pretty much all languages.
Not all, and unless you're using one which knows IRC-specific protocol already you'll have to set that up
06._.
...I said pretty much.
06I left after getting my name identified, and I come back to this o-o
Also, do you know what I mean by sockets?
They are not IRC specific.
Taking the whole system into account anyway, there's more than twenty things you'll have to support for a fully-functional IRC client
and yes, I know sockets are not IRC-specific. THat does not mean that IRC uses them the exact same way as everything else.
O.O!!!
Well, PHP isn't made to support IRC, and yet you can connect to a server with it very easilly.
2Heya guys!
O.O!!!

Jerreh, Jerreh, Jerreh he's the star of the show!
/me ish petted
Jerreh, Jerreh, Jerreh it's the name you should know~
I'd also like to point out that mirc.exe is 2.3 MB in size, and still relies on other files to function. You think that's twenty lines? Yes, mIRC has other things, but a fair amount of that will still be the IRC
21 lines including joining a channel.
And responding to pings from the server.
so that gets you the most basic IRC client possible. Not very fun and relies on fairly complex systems already made for you
Although, with that there is no text box to type, but you can still send messages to the channel from it.
anyway, I'm off, 10 pm here

i do have an acekard XD
hm?
7O.o
7ALTAIR
is it possible to hack the game or add something to allow it to use wi-fi?
7If you get it, FOCUS ON THE PLOT.
?
like, because KH 358/2 Days can't connect over wi-fi like Pokemon
o.O ok
oh
I was wondering if it's possible to hack it so it can use wi-fi
that sucks :(
No
Thats doubtful ns
and then be tricked into seeing it the same way as local connecting to other DSes
Yeah, I think it IS possible
but it'll take a freaking LOOOOOOOONG time
I haven't owned any KH game
with a lot of glitches and errors
lol Altair
and I haven't played one for... 6 years XD
KH 358/2 Days is win
LOL
xD
i helped my friend beat the original one
and it was fun tbh
7Well, it was a bit boring at some parts, NS.
7Oh, and oddly enough...
Bored D:
12lol
lol Quan
that's epic fail
/me hugs Umbreon back
7Really?
lol Altair
7That guy had a point.
eh
not really
7Do you see him being concerned about anything?
perhaps a little
7Well, other than his sitar?
that's still not very apathetic though
LOL
and Altair, KH1 is pretty cool
KH2 is win
lol
/me prefers KH1 to KH2...
/me 7actually has that date and information memorized. O_o
12even tho Axel is in #2!
/me hides
wait
i had KH2 o____O
for the gba, right?
12had? D:
7No.
12no
7That's CoM.
12thats Chain of Memories
ok
12<late> x-x
yeah, had
i traded it in i think
or traded it with someone
idk XD
12well, CoM is the worst in the series :/
Lol gba games are fun
Yeah
7I actually agree with that.
i played it and i was like...
"I am disappoint"
7Though Re:CoM's not half bad.
lol
12thats not saying much because it IS an ok game...
i guess i'll try 358
7Did you follow the plot, Alt?
12but I say KH 358Days/2 was everything Com wasn't
Quan, yes
7Did you know of what happened before the events of CoM?
and another thing why I found it fun was because I was able to battle with my friend
nope
:|
7Oh, and GBA PS cutscenes. O.o
I mean, I know some of it
12if only Days had WiFi...
lol
Like, the basics
well LL
7Argh, we all lament over that, eh, LL?
That's what I'm trying to do
from playing 1 some
12lolyes
12NS?
12trying? o.o
I'm trying to set a wi-fi option up
by hacking the ROM
7Then how're you gonna distribute that?
DOWNLOAD
8D
12lol
I'm actually playing TWEWY
you'll need an R4 or similar though
lol Altair
acekard 8D
12?
TWEWY is okay
12playing what?
KH is better
i'm actually loving that game
7NS, I have it on a DS.
the world ends with you
yeah it's pretty good
12oh
12is that a "real" game?
7How'dya expect you get that to work?
yes
12ok
I know Quan, but I'm setting up an option for everyone who has an R4 etc.
7I met a bunch of TWEWY fans at a dAmeet.
or you can set it on the computer
I think No$GBA has a wi-fi option
but I'm not sure
wel
7On a separate note, what character do you like using in multiplayer? You mentioned Xemnas before..
or I forgot which emulator has wi-fi
imma download it.
8D
hm, I like using Xemnas still
Except I find him a little slow
7Wait, that reminds me:
7Xenon Manganese Arsenic. :D
/me 7FLEES?
and Xemnas is a pretty cool guy in KH 358/2 Days
wat
wat
12yes Quan

/me hides

06what's wrong with it
06?
03well

2is it better or worse?
06forgot that pokemon 3 was the last one they changed the music to
06it's not what i wanted
06not bad, but...
06T_T
2D:
06pokemon 3's music is my favorite by far
2aww
06there's a poor quality version of one of my favorite songs
06but you can hear it at least
2:C
06http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZeBfUgXU0I&feature=related
06also not the exact song. I think someone did that themselves
2oh, that one
2yeah, obviously *nothingmeanmeant*
06I love the music from that movie
06I get goosebumps still
2o-o
06especially when entei is breaking down the barrier to the unknown
2yeah
2Hmm
2I own this movie, and I haven't watched it for years
06O3o there's a chunk of peanut butter in this cupcake
03o.o they changed the music for ALL the movies
03up until ... 10 I believe?
06drf, no
03yes they did
2o3o at least some of it
2not all
2XD
03they changed the order around, at lest
06?
03*least
03I know 4EVER had its own dub score
06ah
03but 4KIDS ftw
2XD
06oh yeah, forgot 4 did too
03I don't care if they changed the music, they make it just as good
03seriously, ALL of them did
039 or 10 was the first one to use original music
06I thought 5+ had the original
03No.
06I know that 5 did use soe of the original music thoug
06h
12i thought 8 had the original
06uhf
12considering i actually watched the movie in japanese
2o3o
2XD
2did you understand it?
12nope :D
2like, actually UNDERSTAND it?
2*late*
2XDDDDD
03it had *some* of the original
03but they changed it around
12i just sat there and nodded
03which, as I said, is fine
2o3o
03seems like people on this channel get too uptight over music >_>
12drf
03The dub music is awesome, I seriously love some of 4KIDS' stuff like The World Turns To Ash from the second one
03and the Guardian's Song
03what
12a lot of people here get uptight about something bad aimed at Lugia
2XD
03LOL
06loool
03I just get uptight about iPods, Apple, or any other overrated product
/me runs
06well then
2I prefer the original, mostly because, y'know
06lemme say this
2its the ORIGINAL
06"The Guardian's Song" is not my favorite song for the movies
12you get uptight about ice cream as well
2and it just tends to go with the mood better usually (at least to me)
12"darnit the ice cream truck ran away from meh D:)
12:
12:
12:
12....i give up
06my favorite has to be either molly's theme of celebi's revivial
2o3o
12"
06but I'm nitpicky about lugia's anatomy, unfortunately
2XD
06and due to me bugging people, I'm gonna not be so picky
06I'll keep it to myself
2o-o
/me has finished her cupcake, and so goes back to drawing
2XD
06was that directed at me? XD
2o-o
2It may have been to me
03no, at everypone
06lol
03I saw more than just a couple "OMG they RUINED the music in HG/SS so I'm not buying it!!"
06oh I HATE that
06seriously
2XD
06so what if some of that music is ruined
12Aurora
06I'm dead excited about it
12who plays a game for the music
2That's just sad
06I do partially
12if you want to get a game for the music you might as well get the soundtrack
06BUT I play mainly for storyline
2o3o I'd play it for the pichu *shotkilled*
03exactly
03No, but really
03I usually have it muted
03I don't care that much about music
12if i could i'd install tribal ink music in the game lol
06I'll have music running for the first few weeks, and then it's muted form then on
06unless I'm bored
03generally for me it's if I have something better to listen to I do
03but if I have no music on me I'll have it turned on or w/e LOL
06lol

03back
12wb
03LOL
03So, I want to invent something that will replace cashiers :o
03basically, here's the idea
03you walk into the store, and scan your credit card
2o-o
03if you're using cash, then you'd still'need to do it the normal way
03then basically, you'd grab all your items
06drf....self-service registers
06safeways' got em
03Lazier than that anyway
03all of them would have unique barcodes that can be detected by the metal detectors, right
03so the idea is, you put all the stuff in the cart
03and just walk out the door
03and as you leave, the metal detectors will ring up each item and just bill your credit card
03make sense?
06yeah
06that's alot fo barcodes though
03Like I said, for cash you'd still have to do it by hand or whatever
03not *barcodes*
03barcodes need to be scanned
03I mean, some sort of magnetic sensor
06ah
03I don't know for sure yet, LOL
06but same thing
03But I think it definitely could work
06each would have to be unique
03per product
03not per item
03they already do it with barcodes...
06hmm
06true
03all you do is digitize it and replace that with a computer chip that brings up those digits when radio waves pass over them
03I'm sure it's still a few years off, I'm just thinking concepts
2o-o
12http://notalwaysright.com/shoplift-and-drag-and-haul-away/1214
03but it's definitely not impossible, and would be awesome
06indeed
06also

Spacewolf flying a ship powered by Spicedrives

Just watch out for ships fitting Spice scramblers and Spice disruptors
Before you know it, you'll arrive at Arrakis o.O

If that call was to me, and she didn't hang up, I'd be asking "Did you actually FIND any piercings in your food?"
12it's amazing how many dumb people are in our world :(
03Lol
what's even better is she's actually stated all employees are required to remove all piercings before working
12indeed lol

12dunno
07I'm a carrier!

If you hybridise bird flu and swine flu... do you get pigs that fly?
12i'd guess
Has anyone here ever heard of an IRC client with a spellchecker before?
12no
12have you?
/me checks other channels
12i take it you have
07Good morning
12good morning back
07I like pizza :D
12so do i
07I eat it hot for lunch or dinner, and cold for breakfast. lol
12at least you're not like some people who make it sit out for 4 days then eat it
07That cant be good for you
07Or maybe it is.
07The mold could work as penecillin
12if it doesn't kill you
/me gives you a hidan plush
07I like my pizza fresh and with crushed red pepper and lots of parmesan cheese on top
12cheese is alright
07But I need the mozz cheese too. I know some people that like theirs with only parmesan
07Weirdos!
12it's pref
07Lol, I know
07xD
12:)
12my opinion
12if it doesn't make you cry
12it's not spicy enough
12if it kills you
12it could of been just a tiny bit more spicy
07I picked a bad time to use the computer. Its in the same room as the birds and they are going freakin crazy this morning!!
12o-O
07Lol, thats how I like my chicken wings. If they dont make you break out in a sweat, send 'em back!
12if your body incinerates from the pure spice of the food
12it was just right
07lol
07I love hot sauce. I wont use the sissy store bought stuff. I make my own
12lol
12lucky
12you know how to
07Yep. Its not hard. I use a combination of different peppers for heat and flavor
/me gives you some ghost peppers
07Oooo!
12now make magic
07Lol
07Im going to kill the parrot. He keeps meowing and making the microwave sounds!
12o.o
07Hi Shiny
07Great, now she's barking
12fun parrot
07Lol, I guess
07Shes been alot more vocal so she gets attention. We got a new love bird and the parrot wants to make sure she's still the favorite
12lol
07Know whats gross but really funny?
12dunno
07She immitates my bf passing gas! XD
12....lol
12i think nothing is more fun in life than adopting a parrot
12you never know what is going to come out of it's mouth
07She's actually pretty smart. She can immitate almost anything that she hears often enough
12yeah
12just don't put her close to a frying pan
07O__o
07I just gave her a tomato. She be quiet for awhile now
12lol
07She loves the little "grape tomatoes"
12i see
07Nothing shuts up the little birds though
07You just gotta tune them out
12a nuke?
12some complications though
07LOL! That just may work!
12http://notalwaysright.com/captain-obvious-to-the-rescue/94
07Even if you try to cover the cage, they wont stop. Its like they're saying we're not stupid! We know its daytime!
12lol
07Brb. Have to attack a clan
12k
stick a bright bulb in there with the wires trailing out, cover the cage and flash the light on and off to see if they get so scared they shut up
07LMAO @ Horo! That would be too mean!
12probably work though
12unless they get so scared they peck a hole through the cage and start attacking you
if it was a cage made of cardboard or chocolate, they could probably peck through it yes
07Nope. Big wire cage. Cant peck through
12hey if you're desperate enough you can do almost anything
jump 500 feet in the air to catch your flight just as its taking off, for example? ;p
12i don't think it's possible to be that desperate
07I haven't noticed an S on any of their chests, so I dont think they'll be getting out anytime soon. xD
Lol
though, is it actually possible to get non-wire cages for birds?
I'd've thought that anything else and they'd either suffocate or be able to get out
07I suppose you could build one from ventilated plexiglass, but I wouldnt
electromagnetic shield!
07Lol
07We have invisible fence for the dog, but the collar is too big for the birds! :P
helllooo!
07Hello, Arti
07Having a good day?
how are you?
07Im great. Finished a project ahead of time, instead of waiting til last minute as usual!!
12hi
I'm going to guess no-one here knows how keyboard layout switching works in Linux
07Uh, def not me. Wait for DRF to get on. He will most likely know
12he knows everything
DRF uses Linux?
what are ypu using linux for?
I've got Linux on my laptop. Runs faster than XP
is it a netbook?
I couldn't stand whatever version of linux came on some netbooks I used
EeePC
07Im not sure if DRF uses it, but he sure does know a ridiculous amount of tech stuff.
Using Eeebuntu (nice name)
yeh I hate that
07Lol
07Helpful if you need it though
why do you hate it?
might be fast but its disfunctiona to me
l
games crash on it, hardware setup is long winded, crap everything else
I've noticed a few small problems but they're apparently because this is a newer model of Eee so it's not fully supported
but I'm a proper windows person
12linux rules
do you use it then?
07Arti, do you like the new 7?
12i do when not at home
Hardware setup as in something like art tablet?
7 is such a step up
no, printers etc.
Nyway I use 7 and love it
ah. I've not set up our printer yet
07I havent been able to try it yet, but my friends that have tell me its great
and my copy of 7 should be coming between now and the 6th
07Need to find a college student so they can get it for me for only $30
Students get it for $30?
I got it fre, legit as well
*free
07Alot of new computers and lap tops came with an available free upgrade. My computer is old as dirt
07 ):
07Hi all
07Horo, yes, many colleges are offering that deal
eh well, I still got it cheaper that retail price
07Well, honestly I dont know how many, but some do
07Oh, thats good
When I was buying the OS for the new comp, I could pick Vista, (cheapest for same edition) Vista with upgrade option, (slightly more expensive) or Win7 preorder with discount on final retail price (most expensive)
I went for the middle one
07I wont be able to get 7 on this computer. Its XP. They said I'd have to remove all of the apps, install 7, then reload the apps. I dont know how, and cant pay anyone to do it.
On a similar note of strange prices my CPU (which included CPU cooler etc.) was Â£40 cheaper than the OEM version (which doesn't include those things)
07Plus I have no idea where most of the disks are to be able to re-install
07Huh, thats weird Horo
You could possibly do it by getting a new HDD, installing to that, then copying apps over
-most- will work without proper installation. The ones that don't will be made easier by the fact you've got the name there and can more easily search for the installer
07Um...I know almost NOTHING about computers, so, no I couldnt. xD
It's not that hard, but if you'd rather not mess around with any of your computer's insides ...
07Wow, my stomach is making noises. Who's making me something to eat?!
I gotta go
seeya after work
12bye art
07Lol, ok everybody. GTG. Byes!
12bye
07Eww! Dont want that buffet!
12but your stomach said it is alright :(
07My stomach only heard swine and then assumed BACON

05like pidge told another girl that he had been going out with arti until i stole her and she ran off with me because of my money
05as if arti would have ever gone out with him
05welcome
The one thing thats bothering me is why he has done that
05also he was spreading around lies about me to make me sound evil
2you guys didn't offend him or anything right..?
05to make himself sound better
05he has been an arse to jess too
http://mrxfromplanetx.com/aldous-huxley-brave-new-world/

05basically she told him to stop treating jess so bad and he told her to get stuffed

7Hai, Arti.
it's been a wish I had for...well....I have no clue for how long now

06does german have the words you seek?
/me runs
well, at least I can predent I invented a german word describing it^^
06lol
06ok WTH
06stupid WMM
hrm - the only word describing this would be
superkallifragilistischexpialigetic
/me 7blinks

06Windows Movie Maker Error: "C:\Documents and Settings\sarah\My Documents\My Videos\pk\[02] Pokémon - The movie 2000 (The power of one).avi could not be imported. Class not registered"
06stupid error, I don't even know what that means o-o
The fail WMM erros
errors*
7Jubilant? Ecstatic? Overjoyed?
looks like the codec's not installed
06more codecs x-x
well - at least WMM thinks so^^
so well - nighty everyone
whatever
"The startup of an application or service OR the shutdown of an application or service has failed." <-- no joke, that's a real error message within the Windows Server Error log^^
lol
very well - seeya
06regsvr32 %windir%\system32\quartz.dll is a code I read was used to fix this error
06and it did nothing
06:|
I'd try reinstalling WMM Roara
06ok great -_-
Either that or find a better video editing program
06sony was cr@p
Adobe Premier is good
The only decent Sony SOftware would be Sony Soundforge XD
06I don't even know how to uninstall WMM
06it's not on my "add/remove" lisy
06list
o.o
Is it in the start menu?
06yes
Does it have the uninstall option in that?
06no
hmm
OS?
06I should be on SP 2
Vista or XP?
06XP
03o.o why not SP3?
05i maded arti a tail :3
06jk
06SP3
03XD
03Get Uninstall Tool
Go into my computer, click on the C drive, go into program files and find WMM in that
03I'll give you the cracked one
Tailfeathers?
03Run utool2.exe to install it, then the patch to ... patch it
03Uninstall Tool wins as it scans your registry for leftover traces after the program uninstalls, and will remove any leftover traces
03and it also gives you hidden programs like MS Updates and stuff that aren't usually in the menu
06huh
Interesting program DRF
12Forgot to shut down
Night Arti

The school admins inplimented a new rule. Seems they think students are abusing bank time so now we're not allowed to leave early at all, unless we have a legitament excuse. The only way to use any bank tie is to miss the entire day instead of part of the day. XP

Oh
12me and swine flu do not match very well

I used to cough a lot when I was 6 though.
lol
12I have Turrets
o_O
PS!
/me tries again in vain to run from NS's draconic hunger
/me hugs
/me huggles PS
07hi!
Also
13Can't really stay long. Kinda snuck on :/
/me would glomp, but he is a nomtoy...
I really had to ban them
13... Because they were ranting on what you did?
Nope
omg I noticed it was taklitve
=flaming etc.
ban them for 5 minutes
And I don't really care about ranting tbh
*banned
12hello?
yep
13Flaming? Don't you think that was kinda flaming on what you did?
why hello thereeeeeee!
hm?
What did I do?
12XD
no offense but tha purple hurts my eyes -.o
or pink whatever it is
Both said you posted in their RP, commenting on how bad it was
that Lion rp?
lol
That wasn't flaming
Tbh
No offence
Fro is a retard for reporting that as flaming
12XvX
And I didn't comment on how bad it was
/me yawns "I'm getting tired 3x"
I only posted a meme
Hang on
I'll get my post for you guys
07kk...
lolwut
Survival Guide of the Lions. Lions.
O mai it's a lion now get into the car :U
lolxD
with a picture
which I can't find the link for
how is that bad?
that's not flaming, though.
I know it's just humor
12Has anyone heard of 'The Universe' from the History channel?
Yeah
and Fro reported it as flaming
sad,
12i didn't know the history channel had it's own universe
/me yawns
12XD
12no theres a show called the universe
I better go to bed I'm about to fall asleep
12on the history channel
g'night =3
D:
12did you know there is planets around pulsars
7o.o
12Pulsars are fast spinning stars about 7 miles in diameter if anyone didn't know.
7uh...
12After supernovas...
7It should be "there ARE planets around pulsars"
7:[
lolol
12the planets formed after the supernova
XD
12what!?
7"is" is a singular word.
12oh
7:]
12I get it
'-'
12anyway...
07wb
wb
and PS
I don't think thats humor, NS
That is humour
And I intended it as humour
12If you listen closely to your radio, you will hear a weird sound from space.
12it's from Jupiter...
"O main it's a lion now get into the car" is a reference to one of the internet rules and memes
7its called interference
one of the rules (forgot which number) states: If one sees a lion, one must get into the car.
12it is a rare thing to listen for
it's a reference to that
12it sounds otherworldly
02Seriously. Internet RULES? That's just... *sighs*
the 100 rules of the Internet?
7o.o
12Im serious
12and...
I think the first few rules and rule 34 are the most well known.
12Has anyone heard of the Multiverse theory?
lol
12idk
02Ya know what, I don't care if its a darned rule or not
I know the rule up to 47 or something
O.o
PS
They're not actual rules
And my post was a joke, you know.
7uh...
Hi :>
^^
02I'm not idiotic, I know that. THey're just some chain of random retarded things someone thought was funny.
Anybody here got an idea for me for my science fair project? o3o
lol
07blow up something
7just a sec, I needa do my bibl- SCIENCE FAIR
Why are you being argumentative?
12it's a parallel universe theory
7okay
/me checks on the puppy lulz
7so, you take a bottle of odwalla
7drink it up, then half-stuff it with bits of fruit.
02Because these 'rules' hurt one of my friends, and they were banned because of it.
7it meaning the empty bottle
07then stuff the other half with dynamite
07and blow it up
uh
what?
7so what you do then, is, close it,- YES, this does involve explosions
...meaning?
12there could be another earth out there about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 light years away
7close it, and stick it in a locker, or some other random place that won't prevent it from fermenting
/me sighs
You mean Fro?
07the galaxy isn't that big lol
7ok, so then, it should expand; once it does, that means its donw
7*done
12that's one parallel universe theory
02Who else do you think? How would you feel if someone just insulted something you did?
hurr
07parallel universes can't be measured in distance o3o
7then, you take the bottle, open it up, and either have people try to guess what was in it, or set fire to the released methane and watch it flare
where did she get banned, again?
7he's right
If you're talking about the HoR shoutbox, it had nothing to do with that
Wait what have I missed?
lol
12well that was parallel universe #1
12look it up
7._.
07oh, you mean the WRONG Theory
/me runs
7no thanks, how 'bout you just explain
12No
02Sometimes, NS, I think 'lol' is the only word you can type...
7"And that's why we're the chemical group!"
o rly nao?
/me hides
lolage
2<Satol> I swear, four of use get together and stick stuff in bottles every week to observe what happens
I've typed a lot more words than that here :P
/me glares. "Oh-wow. It was so funny I forgot to lol"
12well, the theory is that the universe is really endless, so that could mean there is another copy of our earth about 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 light years away
07brb
lol
k
3I do it for the sake of science (and its fun), they do it because its fun.
xP
lol
And there it is again 8D
PS
2mmmmm nope
lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
Seriously
07that contradicts itself
xD
12its the truth
2exactly
INTERNET
xD
7D:< its my turn on the computer, guys!
LOL INTERNET
SRS BUSINESS
I R IN UR INTERNETZ
12there is a nother uneverse theory
8D
07that would mean that it isn't a parallel universe, it's just the same exact universe
7exactly
Get out of my internetz!
8D
7you can't have two of the same thing
And PS, try not to get all dramatic over this, k?
02I RLY DUN CARE
It's over
Yeah you are
Perhaps you want to defend Fro, but this is really unnecessary
07just with a parallel earth, which is statistically possible but infinitely low
If you really want to be satisfied
O_o;;
Let's say I've already had my beating from Shiny, literally, k?
Parallel worlds?
02Fro has been my friend longer than you have. I only want to do whats right.
Reborn! *shot*
But
If you want to do what's right, you need to understand what's right first
12the other parallel universe theory is that there may be an infinite # of universes overlapping each other.
You're taking this over the top
02And if you think I'm taking this towards Drama, I'll leave, I have to go anyway
12stop please
It's over, okay?
okay
bye
7:\ I doubt it, honestly
wow
What a load of dramatic crap
massive...crap
Yeah I agree
7wait... stop stating out opinions?
I find it funny how some people take the internet sometimes,
07lol
xD
Yeah
Stop what? =O
Some people need to take a good look at reality
That reminds me lol
I posted "Look at reality." in my post on HoR
internet is totally serious business guys
This is the internet not reality -v-
In response to Shiny's drama
Also
You guys are able to moderate the Help, Support and Suggestions forum now
12another is that our universe is just a cosmic bubble around a 'bulk' or Huperspace, that means there is other universes out there bumping, colidding
if you didn't receive my PM xD
Well if they want to continue being stupidly dramatic over things that clearly don't matter (I read up) I shall start being a little more active
And yeah I got it NS :P
lol
12and pinching off eachother
eh, HoR is already dramatic
It's really sad
12colliding*
The first 2 months were fine
but when the shoutbox came in
That's what I believe. o.o
I should try and make it NOT dramatic when I find some time :>
instant fail
12me too ^v^
yeah
xD
12there is about 5 parallel universe theories
12but I can't remember them all
Eh, removing the shoutbox will cause rage
07I like the dimensional parallel universe one, actually
but it's better for HoR overall tbh
12???
07it makes the most sense lol
7yeah
Notice something here
?
12^v^
What is that, Kyu?
12ya
Shoutbox will cause rage if removed?, it didn't on TST (unless something happened behind the scenes that we don't know about)
lol
12what is that theory?
Actually it did
sorta
and I lol'd at L2X's topic
"Yes. Yes it is"
It was really funny xD
/me flees
12???
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeereroara
06offs
Hullo, Roara Aurora~
Ro-ro-ro-Roara? O_o
7Hey~
magical fail is fail
06ok so, my costume was awesome o3o
12anyway, did anyone know there about 10 types if ice
7:3
07the one where, there's our 3 dimensional world, and we're traveling along the 4th dimensional line called time. and in order to visit a parallel universe, you fold time
7yes
07something like that
07o3o
06I haven't taken the gauze tape off my feet though
06I kinda like it there
06o3o
12oh I know that one
7o.o
12the quark theory
12Ice 1, frozen water
snow
07that's not what it's called o3o
07quarks are particles
12Ices 2 3 4 5 & 6, well I dont know
Welcome to the world of Internet Magical Fail 8D
06looool
06took the tape off
xD
7Quarks are particles within nutrons, electrons, etc.
ouch
12Ice 7, Is like Crystallized water
Damnit
06while it was fun having it on, it felt awesome to take off o3o
end of school
Have to go
06it's not super sticky, so it didn't hurt
06it tickled XD
XD
I'll be back in about 2-4 hours
07lol...ice is crystallized water o3o
7Nutrons, electrons, and protons are parts of atoms, witht he neutrons and protons forming the nulceus and the electrons revolving around them
basically everyone
12Ice 10, Is like Diamond water
Glass is a liquid
7uh...
06glass is a solidified liquid, in that sense
/me 7doesn't argue with Lugia's logic, but still doesn't understand where that came from
7So's Murcury
7*mercury
06or....in its heated sense, it's liquified solid
06mercury isn't solid o-o
12The universe, from the history channel
06it's lisquid
If you freeze it, it is
:O
06lol
06k
7its a metal, actually
06gotta take the tape off my other foot
06it's one of two liquid elements
07ice is just ice, lol
06it may be metal, but it IS liquid
06bromine is the other
7the freezing point of Mercury is so low that its usually considered liquid o3o
7its both
/me puts the tape on Roara's tail
07it only differs when it freezes at different ways
12Ice 7 is what happens when you crush water Sooooo tight that it crystallizes
06I can't call water a solid when it's not
7:|
07but it's not like you can even distinguish by looks lol
7water CAN be a solid
7Mercury CAN be a liquid
12what?
06IN NATURAL STATE
06mercury is liquid
12thank you!
7no
06and because the periodic table only looks at natural state
7:|
07freezers?
07=3
/me 7still doesn't give up yet
06...
06you lost this one, butkeep going
12there might be a water like planet out there
06this is fun
7" A heavy, silvery d-block metal, mercury is one of six chemical elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure,[1][2] the others being caesium, francium, gallium, bromine, and rubidium."
7:|
7Lugia
06gallium is solid
12what?
7there IS an ice-based moon orbiting Jupiter
06but even at body temperature it melts
12omg
12this headache x-x
FRAAAAAAAANCE?!
06I know, because I got to play with a lump of it last year o3o
12and this feeling of being on fire
06it was fun
06anyhoo
12XD i mean a planet out side of our solar system
7oh
06Mercury is a metal yes. That is what element it is. Element =/= State of Matter
07well duh lol
7:|
06it is LIQUID state of matter
06in natural form
7I said it was a metal, and you said no
7and now
06...
06I never said that O_
06o
06dshufds
06O_O
7you're saying its a metal
06I said it's LIQUID
06but it is a metal
07lol
7:|
07o3o
06yes
lol Kyu
7XD
06actually she did lol
7no I didn't
AURORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaa
no she didn't O_o
AERO YOU'RE LATE.
7I said that it has the lowest freezing point of metals
XDDD
06AEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

2That's okay~
06Kyu, I tried SO hard in polisci on monday
Translation: If you can actually draw it, do whatever as long as it's one of her characters. <------ Rough translation
/me 2usually ends up messing up either the ears, the nose, or the anatomy altogether
06I drew it at last two dozen times
06all failed
2XD
06the mouth/whiskers kill me
07draw it larger on another layer so it's easier, then shrink and merge?
07o3o
2XD
06ok, I took a WHOLE PAGE
Or just try harder?
06and drew it giant size
06it FAILED
07O.-.o!!

03o.o
07drf
03what didn't work?
07DUH.
03What
/me runs
06wmm couldnt be removed
2Happy Bunnehs come from California, drf
/me is listening to 3»»2 LACUNA - Celebrate the Summer 2006 (Rob Mayth Remix) 3«»2 02:21/05:51 3«»2 256 kbps m4a (iTunes) 3««
03Trance FTW
03and o.o
06it worked fine, but wmm wasn't even on the list
03I didn't say it would be
03I said it's a good program :P
06and so I went straght to WMM's project file
/me GIMPS drf
06tried deleting it
06it wont delete
03you patched utool, right?
03maybe google "uninstall windows movie maker xp"?
2uh....
06it said something about it being in use, so I checked processes
2o-o
06it wasn't running at all o-oo
03safe mode FTW?
/me 2still doesn't know DX
06safe mode?
07doesn't know what?
03You seriously don't know what safe mode is? LOL
2Orchid/white
2X-x
06not really
03LOL
12it's a mode that protects you from DRF
06lol
2I still don't know why I love that color comb- wait, yes I do]
03It basically boots in a very primitive mode that doesn't load anything but the very essential windows files, it's useful for removing pesky viruses and stuff
03and who am I kidding, WMM is a virus, just one made by Microsoft
/me hides
2its the color combo of my backpack and also of one of my favorite shirts
03It's so primitive it doesn't even load video drivers LOL, so it's like a tiny resolution
2actually, the shirt is orchid and blue/white, but almost the same thing :|
06I just want a bloody video editor that isn't a piece of crap like Sony was
2XD

I CAN TEACH YOU THE WAYS OF CRAZY :D
06or what are the symptoms?
03LOL Swine flu
03It's seriously a fricking media scandal
12early symptoms
03nothing more
06hmm
12asking how does one catch is it kind of a duh question lol
gah...im trying to remember the combo it is...
06sore throat and fever
12i see
06that's what she got first
it's something mixed with human influenza, isn't it?
06she said she was achey
06then she was tired all the time
03C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
/me runs
12that's somewhat a relief
06lol
/me kicks drf

12yeah
adfasfk Imma post tomorrow. TAT
12or so they say
06you'll basically feel like crud all day
06all week
03LOL
06until you DIE
12i have this neverending runny nose going on
/me runs
bai pplz
12and this relentless headache
06bye
03Seriously though
06UPLOD
06MY
03swine flu is NOT a big deal
06PIC
06I'm not worried about it
XDDDD
12i know it's not a big deal
06at all
07AND POST
07D=<
03yeah
03my mom keeps telling me I'm gonna die from it
03but she's stupid
12drf it's only slightly more irritating for me though because of asthma
03Heh
12only slightly
06but I have to laugh because someone I know also got it, and she was paranoid about it
06we kept telling her 'you wont get it, calm down"
06and lo and behold
06she got it
12roara
12you got to use reverse psychology
12your method doesn't work :(
03LOL
06LOL
06obviously
/me WILL get H1N1
12omg
06but because of that
12this stupid headache
06I'll have used reverse-reverse psychology
03o.o
03I like just being blunt with people
12it's horrible
/me runs
06x3
03I just insulted this girl to her face earlier, it was so much fun
06o-o
03she made some comment about how awesome her MacBook was
06LOL
03and I was like no, you're an idio
03t
06that would do it, wouldn't it
06yeah amazingly, girls don't like that
06guys don't either, I'd imagine
06but lol
12roara all i have to say is that if this is swine flu it's not that bad :P
06points for actually doing it
06bree, it's not
12i've had flus where i threw up food everytime after 5 or so minutes of consuming it
03XD
03but seriously
06even the mild case my friend had was like the flu itself
03I was like "Macs are for people with more money than brains"
12and it didn't matter what it was, food, liquid, medication
03and she was like "Look at how pretty this looks!"
06which, btw, the Influenza A this year is absolutely terrible apparently
07loooooool
03and I was like "fine, stick a pink sticker on my laptop, it'll look the same way"
12i heard it's even worse than the swine flu lol
12so of course everyone worries about the swine flu
06exactly
06a family friend had Flu A just a week ago
06on the phone with him, he literally wished he could die
12only thing about the swine flu is that it lasts a tiny bit longer than your usual flu
06yeah
12i guess if you're working
06and apparently it'll get you a spot on the media
/me runs
12then yeah i'd worry about that
06ok, lemme test corel editor out
06hmm
06this is nice
06it's seriously lagging
03that's your computer :P
03it works fine on normal ones
06I know x-x
03but seriously, if you think Corel lags, go try Adobe Premiere
/me RUNS
03You won't even be able to open a fricking video
03that's how bloated it is
06lol
2o-o
2brb
06ok
06one thing I did like about WMM was that it automatically made smaller clips from the movie
07lol
2XD
06like 30 seconds each
06I cna't figure out how to do that on here
07I have adobe premiere because it came with the cs3 collection
2o3o
07I can't even get it open for 10 seconds before it crashes
03So do I
03but I don't use it
03yeah
03Adobe sucks
03Um
032. you can do it manually, dunno about *every 30 seconds*...
06because I can't work with a 90 minute movie otherwise o-o
03F3 and F4, select start/finish, then there should be a "Trim video" option
03LOL n00b
/me runs
03That's the only way I ever do
03is just one giant file
06n00b?
06that taks FOREVER
03it actually makes it a LOT easier, IMO
06x-x
06?
03because there's not 900000 clips
03just one.
03what you do is
03and seriously, try it.
06yeah but like I said
03Watch the movie through at normal speed, no interruptions
06WMM made 30 second clips
03have paper in front of you
06well
03write down the time codes of stuff you want to use
03then go edit it, you have time codes, problem sovled
06hmm
/me hides
03but seriously, it works
03that's what I did when making the Articuno and Lugia AMV, I just sat down and watched Pokémon 2000 start to finish and wrote down all the Articuno/Lugia clips
06hmm
06well I guess I'll just have to get used to paper then lol
03well what are you trying to do?
03A music video like I do?
06yeah, that's my hobby
06and now that I actually have HQ videos
03except hopefully not using YouTube rips?
/me runs
06lol
06yeah
03well, the thing is
03splitting it into 30 second clips is counter productive
06not how I did it
03because then EVERY TIME you want to use one yo uhave to be like "OK, clip 1... clip 2... which fricking clip is it in?"
06but I'll adapt
06nh
03If you just learn where stuff is in the movie it's MUCH easier
06nah
06I memorized the videpo
03at which point, no point splitting it up.
06video
03So why split it up?
06so I didn't take so long draging the trimming tool
06of course
03...
03F3 and F4
06now it's easier to trim I guess
06so lol
03F3 = selection start
03F4 = selection end
03forget dragging, LOL
06plus it just looked nicer with shoter clips
03and what you can do is like
06of course, that's pulling a mac there, so lol
03Get one part of the movie, put it in the timeline
03then select another part, do the same
03... what is?
06it looks nicer 8D
/me runs
03oh.
03Plus, what happens if a clip you want is split among two partial ones? LOL
06dunno, put em together
06hey, but now that I can do what I want with this computer
06bring on something better
03XD
03Seriously, though, Ulead/Corel is the best video editor I've used
03it's kinda different than you're used to but it's not too hard to figure out
03it even has a bunch of useful stuff you'd ordinarily need avisynth for, like rotating videos (I'm serious), playing them backward, etc LOL
03speeding up/slowing down...
06lol
/me is listening to 3»»2 Michael Franti & Spearhead - Say Hey (I Love You) [feat. Cherine Anderson] 3«»2 00:24/03:55 3«»2 256 kbps m4a (iTunes) 3««
/me wonders if anyone's heard this song
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoaTl7IcFs8 <-- the video quality is so bad it's hard to watch x.x
06OMG GET THAT OFF
06THAT SONG
06IT BURNS
06I hate that song
03LOL
03really?
06yes
03I don't love it per se, but it's catchy
03I heard a few of these new songs on the radio when I went home for the weekend, and downloaded them LOL
06also...I swore I downloaded pokemon 4ever
06guess not o-o
03where are you downloading them from?
06a site o3o
/me rus
06jkfdhfd
03which one?
06not a reliable one, I have to stop after 4ever because some of them look bad
03LOL
03let me guess, SkyFire47's rips?
06http://pokemonanimeworld.webs.com/
06duno
06possibly
06pokemon 2,3, and 4 look fine
06I guess
03ew signing in
06of course, they're english, so they're not nearly as good
06no
03LOL
06but after 4 they do
03We have the English and Japanese ones
03English dubs FTW though
06drf, I never got around to getting to that one
06where again?
03o.o, whose watermarks? SkyFire47/JDS/who?
06it had a wabbuffet o-o
03Pokémon-Originals. But you'd have to download them using XDCC
03EW JDS
06xdcc? I'm afraid to ask
03File servers.
03there's a very specific way to do it
06ah
03but our rips are *good*, LOL
03did you want English or Japanese?
06japanese
06unless you have english with the japanese video
06english audio
rawr
2o3o
03wait, what?
03I don't know if we have dual audio o rnot
06not dual
03what, dub over rwa?
03*raw
06yeah
03why?
03The English ones look better anyway
06raw video for look-quality
06oh o-o
03the raws suck, LOL
03No, seriously
034KIDS did some color correction
03and they look better, IMO
2o3o
2nah
06way TOO much correction in Pokemon 5
06too blue
2 4Kids made color "correction"
2exactly
06electricity turned green lol
2they placed a blue tint over most of it
2XD
2drf
2I think it looks better to you because that may have been the first one you saw
03that was only in Heroes.
06I think 5 is the one I'd need in japanese
03the rest of them are awesome
03Like, seriously
03look at the second one
03the Japanese video looks flat
03like, really really flat.
2:{
2*:P
03Well we're actually working on a DoR of 5, but it's not done.
03either way, we have both of both.
/me 2disagrees heartily
2XD
06I loved the color correction in 2000
06haven't seen many of the other raws though
2XD
03I think the dubs look better, 5 maybe being an exception
03and heck
03there's supposedly proof that the raw of 7 was *worse*
/me 2doesn't
03as in, they changed some stuff
2XD
2how so?
03but the dub left it alone
2o3o I highlydoubt that
03but it's not OTV, therefore it sucks
03you want pictures?
/me runs
2o3o
06sure?
06and for crying out lous
03I'd have to look back in my log... but eh
06I wanna kill my laptops lagging
03LOL
2XD yes
03o.o
06it is literally at 100% right now
07o3o
2no
06and hasn't gone down once
2XD
2duh
03where do yo ulive?
06CPU
06mIRC and Corel
2I'm assuming we live in the same time zone
03LOL
03so you went to Japan?
2drf: the difference is that I go to Japan every year XD
2Visiting my grandparents
If it's 6:04 am where you live, then you're in my time zon.
zone*
06nope
06it's 11:05 pm here
2XD
03Oh
03get me some Japanese promos?
/me runs
2XDDD
03but seriously, there are *tons* of rental-shop Pokémon that hasn't been ripped
03x.x stupid lazy japanese rippers
2lol
03it's super useful but nobody HAS it
2o3o
03but that's rediculous
2o-o
07lol
2uh...
2Â¥3000?
2that's less than 30 bucks
03No.
06at this point, I say screw this
03actually $3000.
2XD
/me closes corel
2wow
03http://usotsuki.info/deoxys_compar.jpg <-- This.
06100% CPU for 10 minutes straight
03Dutch is a Dutch DVD, but it's the English dub
2o-o
2that's crazy
03see how they changed the font?
2CPU overload, gotta wait a bit
06yeah
03now I didn't make that, but the guy who did said the Japanese font is NOT the original one
2o3o
07lol
/me is listening to 3»»2 Ke$ha - TiK ToK 3«»2 00:44/03:19 3«»2 256 kbps m4a (iTunes) 3««
03This song is so catchy
03but it's such a chick song
2and you believed him straight off the bat?
03I'm ashamed >_>
07whoever was the artist for the original background should be fired
07XD
2XD
03*stu\ff
06Evacuate the Dance Floor
03*STUFF
2really
06once again is playing o3o
03Yes.
2XD
03I'm seriou1s
03*serious
03I'm the dubbie expert, but we have a LOT of people who specialize in rawsx
03-x
2that doesn't make him top-know it all, you know
/me 2doesn't mean that to be offensive
2aaaaaand its still loading
03LOL.
2drf, what did you use to upload it?
03I didn't say he was, but he heard this from a reputable source.
03... it's not mine.
2o3o
2reputable?
2Yeah, I know its not yours
2I mean, what's the source for the image?
03DVD.
2FINALLY ITS LOADED
03we have the Japanese DVD, as well as the dub
03Dutch because it's widescreen
03English one is cropped, stupid VIZ VIdeo
06eh
03anyway, Ulead Video studio is what Corel is based on
06I actually wanna go to bed right now
06lol
03but it's older, and I *think* less CPU intensive
2The Japanese one is clearer-colored, has better-integrated lettering, and overall looks nicer to me
06crud
2o-o
06I have to go to an art museum on friday
06ew
06>_<
2The Dutch one looks flat
Why not just get PS CS4? O_o
2like you said that Japanese looks
06...?
06for what dari? o-o
I dunno, I don't like GIMP...It's slow loading. Especially with its fonts.
03well
03GIMP is lighter overall
2o3o
06I'm getting CS3 soon
06for free
03it takes longer to load, but once it's loaded it's fine.
06GIMP is fine, my only issue is layer control (like resizing, moving, etc)
06but that's not bad
I dunno, maybe I just like knowing that I'm cheating adobe out of $800 or something.
2Mmmmm
06lol
2I recognize the Japanese one more o3o
06everyone likes that I think
2although its quite possible
06wait
03For the earlier movies, at least, not sure about 7.
2drf
03no, but see, what happened was this
2the sizing difference makes it harder to compare, honestly
06I havent seen the 7th in ages
03wait, what?
2o3o
03They didn't paint anything over, I don't think
03but the Japanese one changed it further
03but listen
06ah
What I love about CS4 if that you have one .dll that's 2MB or so, and you download any CS4 free trial, and replace the 1 .dll and then you have it for as long as you want.
03they then dubbed it and shoved it on DVD
2XD
03well
03the Japanese DVD came out first
It's just awesome how easy they make it.
03BUT
2LOL
06lol
2fail
03They messed with it, brightening the colors and such
03changing fonts, etc.
2XD
034KIDS, on the other hand, just left it alone
03From what I'm told. I can't confirm or deny.
06in that piture comparison, while the font of the dutch one looks like it fits the "pokemon style" more, it doesn't fit with the fact that it's a building
2brightening?
2Haruka's bandana is darker in the Dutch :P
2*Japanese
06...
03LOL
Good night
03You guys over analyze everything
2XD Its not brightening, they darkened it
06lol
03Dutch meaning the DVD came out in The Netherlands.
06it's late, I'm tried
03But it's the English dub.\
you know. I never use myspace.
03well the DVD was dual audio
06so whatever goes through my head gets amplified xd
Bye, all
06xD
2I prefer to rather think of it as paying attention to detail :3
I think it stinks
03They cropped it.
06bye
06lkdnkfd
2XD
03that's why we used the Dutch one, it's the only existing widescreen dub release.
06full screen sucks
06end of story
2XD
03well
03don'
2she's right
03don't be so quick to say that.
03For *movies* sure.
2then why, pray
03But TV shows...
03I prefer original aspect ratio
Full screen is awesome when the proportions are right.
06Movies is what I'm considering here
2is the Japanese image LONGER than the Dutch?
06TV shows are meant to be....well, TV
03I hate hwen they crop the top and bottom off TV shows
03WELL
06so, full screen is fine
2XD'
03Some movies, like before the 80s
06but movies should be widescreen
03were actually shot in fullscreen.
03And they cut the top and bottom off.
06lol
06fail
03because they're cheap/lazy
HAI
03I'm not kidding.
2:P
06I hate that
03I have ;a HUGE debate about that on Ultimatedisney
06I've seen amvs like that
2THe Dutch is cropped
03but it was ANIMATED in 4:3, so that's proper.
06by a bit yeah
03why would they spend time and work drawing a full frame if we weren't meant to see it?
2XD
2LOL
2because they thought it looked better
06ok well whatever
06I'm at my limits, so I'm off to bed
2Drf
03what
2the top and bottom are cut off the DUTCHC
06wound up going to bed at 2m last night
2-C
06x-x
03well as far as cropping, it's hard to tell. See how they redid the lines?
07nite Roara
2well
2g'night
03Oh, you mean top and bottom?
2YES
03Bottom looks the same to me.
06oh yeah
06Kyu
03Top, very very slightly, like two pixels.
06picture is sketched
07whee
2also the left and right XD
03And that oculd just be the fault of whoever took the screenshot, LOL
2drf
06just so you know I'm actually working on it ^^
03well
07=3
2notice how you can see part of May's brother's arm in the Japanese
07show the sketch? o3o
03see the vertical lines in the section under "Shopping"?
2look at the Dutch, all you see is his shirt
03They were different in Japanese./
2Yes
2I noticed that
03oh, that's like two pixels.
03because, look at the white button
03on his shirt
2XD
03it's more or less the same
2no
03What's possible is they aren't the exact same frame.
2Japanese is longer
2o3o
03Like one could be off by one or two.
03And that could very well cause it
2if memory serves
03if the camera was zooming in or out...
2in that screen, it pans left to right
03o.o
03could just be a cropped screenshot, I dunno.
2then how is the tip of May's bandana also cropped?
2exactly
03The *screenshot*
2XD
03I'm not saying the Dutch has more picture
03I'm saying the Japanese is different.
2o3o I realize that
2but I'm saying that the one that cuts the image off is the DUTCH
03Um
03but very barely
2:|
03ever heard of overscan?
2Japanese: you see the robot
03Ordinarily you wouldn't even SEE that part.
2:|
03The robot isn't cropped off, I think it's just not there in the English LOL
03Not sure why
03like I said, I didn't make the picture.
2XD
2We humans and our silly attention to detail and tendancy to debate over useless topics
03I was just saying I like the dubs better, seriously, what's the big deal LOL
2o3o I know
2but then I said I preferred the Japanese, and look what happened
2Well, if we're done
2I'd like to bid ye all a good night
meh. I'm going to bed.
'night people
07bai
gonna leave comp on, transferring something.
bloip
well I found this youtube video of an argument. an 18 year old girl had arrived late and never answered any calls because she was meeting with someone she met on myspace.
07lol
and I know what we're all thinking.
>w>
meeting up with someone in person that you met on myspace.
bad idea. that's why I hate myspace.
07bah
07I find it funny how people blame the internet for bad stuff that happens, when it's just the irresponsible people that get into those situations
totally. but she didn't get... you know.
but she could have been!
anyway I can show this video but I gotta warn everyone that the conversation is a teen raiting
maybe higher.
yeah...
so just getting a warning before I post

/me womits`?
02LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
12it's apparently an old time favorite traditional food for wisconsinites
02CHAT STATS ARE EPIC
aha
02http://ho-ohrealm.forumotion.net/Chat-Stats-h10.htm
sounds like french food
12actually i think it was the polish ancesters that started it
12it's scary really how much history i know about my state
02sorry
02had to do that xD
scary how much you know, or WHAT you know about it? :P
12i guess it's not that big of a surprise
12wisconsin probably has close to no history compared to germany :P
02lol
12or australia
02watt
02-t
02lolthat
02colony crap etc.?
12i'm just putting into consideration how new the US is and how old it compares to probably any other country
12well i suppose that counts as well
or do you consider those "gone" :/
02lol
12the first person to set foot on wisconsin (besides the natives)
12was this french guy who thought he was in china
12he was off by a little *cough*
:P
not much, thop :)
02o_O
12well he had the right idea i guess
12but he just didn't know where he was going
12for some reason i think wisconsin history class was actually the only history class i paid attention in XD
lol
12sigh all this thinking is somewhat pulling my mind away from my pain
:)
12i'm going to wait till morning
12get some pills for my headache and maybe everything else
12then hopefully i'll be out like a light
i should be more carefull with those spicy stuff
:P
not good!
12yeah i do admit i eat too much of that
those pills or spicy food?
:P
12has the swine flu found it's way into germany?
jupp
i think one person died to it already
12it's everywhere pretty much now -.-
didnt hear of more
12the people who die though
12usually had a pre-history of some really bad illnesses and conditions
02o_O
12if you have decent health, you should be fine
02bored...
02hurr
12if i honestly do have the swine flu, then i'm looking forward to the fact that they say you don't throw up when you have it
12a few years ago, i got this flu where whatever i consumed i'd throw up the next 2 minutes >_>
10^^
02HAPPY BIRTHDAY 8D
/me hides
.... not good :/
/me changes it. Manually. Mentally.
how long did it take to get rid of it?
12less than a week
02xD
1 week with next to no food ...
02LOL
12thankfully
12that throwing up phase only lasted one night
02D:
/me hugs Umbreon
still sounds awful :/
:/
/me hugs back :/
12:)
im burning as wrell now :(
12odd... it seems that my arms that are out of the blankets feel good, maybe a tiny ache here and there
12but my legs under the blanket are just full out screaming pain
pain?
12the arching
12*aching
because its hot?
12dunno
12you'd think the legs would feel better because they are the ones under the blanket
does it feel like "hot"
12hot
12aching
then its ok...
if its real pain => doctor...
12i have high tolerance to pain though :(
hrm :P
12it's rare for me to actually feel pain and get affected by it
i read that people that think that, usualy have a very low tolerance - anyway - if its realy hurting => doctor
12heh i'll be fine, i've been sick before when my entire body was aching
12i never quite experienced a headache this powerful though
02:(

07My parrot is going crazy this morning!
07Oh?
07Shes running through her entire vocabulary OVER and OVER
07Woah oO
07Although I must admit, its pretty funny when she yells "This...is...Jeopardy!"
07Do you know of that game show?
Another job interview confirmed.
rofl :P
"the devourer will not feast upon the innocent tonight - not on YOUR watch"
ddo has some nice quests in great atmosphere :P
07Dumb swine flu is dumb
hu?
07Mum fell ill too
07Oo

07yeps
Flu tends to be fairly contagious.
07Seems so yeah
07Im about to recover thou...
07I mean I only have 38.6C in fever now >>;
07as opposed to 38.8C or even 39.3C lol
/me converts
1037.5 C o3o
10i think around that
07Oh
07Hey, happy birthday!
07Actually
07that IS the norm
10Thanks, and yeah
'over here'?
Does nominal body temperature vary by region?
07Usually though my body temp is 97.7C
07Er
0797.7F*
07LOL
07Florida, US
07I'm not used to farenheit at all XD
Askew, it's always the same, whereever you are.
07I have a slightly lower one than usual
07Vyl, Im aware of that, I just dont know the conversion, silly!
07Hehe
07Use google ;P
07Is what I do
0737C to F <-
07Well, I really have no use for it. A trip over there would be fabulous, but I have no plans of doing it.
F are weird.
07http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8331338.stm <- O-o
10You can also say the norm = 310,65 degrees o3o
07they honestly expect people to step forward when being gay is illegal..
10But that's something else
/me hides
07LOOOOL
10Kelvin, durr
07Yeah
07I know
07Im going to canada x3
10quite practical... but 200 degrees doesn't sound COLD D:... while it really is
07I know. Our units of measurements are dumb too. I think we're like the only freakin county that isnt metric
07LOL
07Sometimes the UK arent either
07anyway
07I neeeeed food
10lol pounds inches feet
07havent eaten in like 24 hours
10D:
10And wtf o.o
07Vyl or hopes against hopes
07they might take away the law..
07very unlikely but yeah
07>>;
The UK has gone largely metric.
Except for road signs and human weights.
07lols
07well fewd tiem
07before arrow wakes up
Everything else, metric.
07>> <<
07I was taught metric system in school. We were told it was because the US would be switching! LOL xD
10It would be sort of practical with ONE currency and way to measure, but sorta boring 8D
06Although it would be a pretty good idea, I laugh at the thought because I was told that like 25 years ago!!!
The US is the only developed country that hasn't.
06Lol. Hey, I just live here. :P
10ok oo
06Lol
06lol
10Probably want to get the best parts
dragon trees from the moooooooonnn~
06Eh?
06I...see
it makes as much sense to me as to you
~400 years on there's other things like dragon vines as well
funfun
oh, and the moon got blow'd up
06Oh no! What will my neighbor's pain-in-the-butt dogs bark at if theres no moon?! xD
nah, it's still there
just in two large, perhaps a dozen small and millions of tiny pieces
make that three large
06Well thats good. I dont know what I'd do if they were ever quiet!
06Oy. I should get to work making something. Im being lazy because I dont NEED to do anything.
07Hai Articuno
Afternoon Articuno.
06Hello, Arti
/me is a broken bird
07Meeps?
07Whyfor=
07?*
can't stop. thinking about what that idiot has done
that so called best friend. of me
/me is dramatic bird now
OH The sorrow!
07Eh?
you don't know? about tier?
07Yeah but I don't know what he did.
06Disappointment is hard, but you will pull through and then be a stronger birdie?
he's really hurt me, xai, jess and another girl and probably everyone else around him, he's lied, spread horrible rumours.. he's been found out but doesn't care...
07Holy crap...
07So what happens after this?
fhats what he's. been telling people
07What the hell?
and we've told him never to contat us again, to never even speak about us again
07What becomes of Jess?
I don't know! shs got nowhere to go, I don't even know how she is because she won't answer her phone at the. mo
a crptic metaphor.
07ah =/
I I need to call her tonight...
07Definitely
06Sometimes we befriend and love someone because of who we THINK they are. Sorry that happened to you Arti. ):
07And those claims are ... well I have absolutely NO words as they have zero basis in reality... for what purpose did he do something as idiotic?
need to see what he's said to her now to cover it all...
07Holy sheet... is all I can say, WTF Tier.
because he's a. jealous and insensitive arse
07Certainly
iys all I did these years...
he's treated us all so badly
I can't get over it, sorry
I'm so upset
and now I have to go v__v
07That's okay, I mean you were his friend and this just sort of goes against everything you believed
07meeps
/me huggles arti
07Take care alrighty?
yes seeya after work...
07Holy crud.
07I never thought something like THAT would happen.
06Betrayal is terrible
07Definitely
07and especially if its 1. unexpected and 2. from someone you valued
06I only have a handful of true friends. They are like my family. I'd be devastated if they hurt me on purpose
lets hope that this will never happen - you might become the same like me
07Hi Androo
06Ok. Im getting off mah butt. I will make an outfit that will make someone happy. (:
06Bye everybody
:)
baba

The one from ebay

Yep, finally arrived, I forgot to bring it home from work yesterday

06and should definately have a decent price

06after all, someone is putting huge amounts of work into them, as there's obviously more than one

/me floofs her over
06WRONG.
06also
06IT'S BURD.
/me runs
06gonna go find some food
/me pokes Roara when she comes back with something interesing! :O
06There's this guy with Toshirou's Zanpakutou in The 3rd Phantom.
06But more purple-er.
06I think his name was Kusaku?
howdy
/me wants to go back to sleep
06But my body doesn't.
06Now that I'm allowed to, I don't want to. >v>
06I love that movie o3o
/me is not here
06Whut movie?
06Diamond Dust Rebellion
06Ovo
06Who mentioned that?
06Or is that what the other guy is from?
/me hasn't seen DDR
06Kusaka is the name, btw
06he's form that movie
06Lawl.
06from
06I got a letter wrong.
06That so matters.
/me runs
06Hyourinmaru was a twin blade
06the other one was more purple in color and belongs to Kusaka
06Ah.
06I thought he could steal other people's Zanpakutous.
06but rules of Soul Society state that having twin blades like that was agaist the rules
06So I killed him.
06>:D
06so both of them were ordered to fight, and whoever won would be Hyourinmaru's true weilder
06Wait, does that mean Lil' Shiro broke teh rules?
/me flees before Toshirou kills her :O
06how? o-o
06.....
06well no
06neither of them broke the rules
06because hyourinmaru called to both of them
06I'm confused.
06Oh, so it's just like in 3rd phantom with the twins?
06but because two of hyourinmaru by law couldn't exist, Kusaka and Toushiro fought
06cynder, imagine one sword spirit making two swords
06one of those swords must be destroyed
06Well, that seems possible in every way.
06XD
06that's what happened
06watch the movie, you'll understand
06o3o
06Nah.

well, maybe 15 mins
six raytracing render threads, a semi-intensive game and a rather full browser
oh, and Vista
06lolvista
considering it's only stock though that is a decent CPU cooler
handles 130W for that long before the CPU finally has to call it quits
howdy you floofyfloof!

stupid.. whatever that was
/me pokes Quilava\
yeah?
12hey quil
um. yes?
Hullo, Quilava
12just saying hi o.o
hi Kipi
oh. hi
XD
How are you?
squeaky I think.
07hihi
/me squeaks as he squeaks Quilava
/me eeps?
Hullo, Articuno.
How are you?
07Hey Articuno.
/me hugs the blue bird
12I'm still raging p*ssed off that's what
12He doesn't even FRIKKIN CARE..
12Xai actually asked him "Aren't you sorry for all this!?" and he said no basically!!
07What?!
12and he still thinks everything that went wrong last night between him and Jess is me and that other girl's fault!1
07Argh the idiocy - now why is he trying to put the blame on you and that other girl?
07You have EVERY right to be peeved at him though!!
12Because she told Jess everything he's been doing behind her back and when Jess asked me why she said those things I confirmed it was the truth
oO
Well hopefully Jess is gonna withdraw sometime soon.
.
reminds me: Is Jess also getting to the TST meet in November?
12No
12I'm tempted to invite her but I doubt she'd come without Tier -v-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I'll be back in an hour or so.Buh-bye.
Why wouldn't she go without Tier?
Even after all that's happened?
12Because she's naive and believes everything he's said to cover it all up
12and thats why Im gonna phone her soon but she won't let me yet, she's too upset ..
12and hey Lugia..
12I would love to write a big thing about everything Tier has done..
12After all.. he's done nothing but talk about me behind my back all these years....
Meeps, heya Arti...
12I never like to rant like this especially not in teh main chan but this time I'm REALLY hurt and don't care who hears about how awful Tier really is.
sounds good
now come on msn
12You won't take no for an answer you desperate fool.
no
it sure beats you just complaining about some nobody
12Why are you reading it then?
cus its all u talk about
LOl
12No one here is stupid you know, other than you of course
12So don't try and make me look stupid, because it really isn't working
fine
remain emo
whatever good it does ya
12Says you who held a grudge against me for CALLING YOUR LUGIA PLUSH FAKE
12and
hum
12STEALINMG THE GIANT LUGIA OFF YOU D; OH NOES
lol
she angry
arti you are being stupid
it will just take you a couple hours to wake up
...
looks like someone's pushing for a ban.
12Like I said, no one here';s falling for it Zapdos
can anyone tell me who this electifdying bird with the sharp beak is?
Zapdos, I would advise to rather not comment on things you know nothing about
just some dude who's always negative and picks fights with people
know as well as you
or what you think you know anyway
12He's a big hypocrite, says I'm being stupid.. and well........ lol
ehh...the Lugia guy?
12[The]Lugia
07LOL
maybe we'd call him [The]Retard instead?
12See Zapdos?
dunno who your talkin about
/me seconds that
12Turn a blind eye of course
12Ignorance is bliss after all eh?
12Just stop talking, no one cares what you say
like your ignorance with this tier person
eh
07aaaactually
12Look up the meaning of ignorance man
hrm...this Zapdos resembles the Zapdos in the Movie in fact
the only of the birds being catched without even an actual battle
a real <censored>
07oO
Lol
07tiiiimeshift
whew, I didn't know this word was also a swearing word^^
12What was it?
12Ovo
12What word I mean?
a nickname for a little cat

you all read the news concerning the DSi LL?
07eh?
07what about it?
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4371.0
take a look at this
I wrote some news about it
07Hm
07Im not getting the new one
07I have a dsi, will work for a while
07=)
I'm thinking about getting one
10eep
4Hey all.
wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2hey Feather and Horo and RN
now I'm wondering how Xchat can tell someone's online despite them not being in any channels
hi RN
12Hye guys..
12I've asked Jess to stay with us for the TST meet, she's gonna think about it
12It's convenient because we happen to be visiting Devon right before the meet and driving back up the day before it starts
4Yay
12So we could collect her
4Burnett gets paid just before...and since I always go to stuff his friends go to, he said it's very likely he'll come with us ^^
12Good <3
12I really hope Jess comes along
/me runs like hell
4Me too, I haven't met Jess.
4lol what?
12I'm playing matchmaker again XD sorry
4Isn't Jess with Tier?
4lol @ that.
maybe I can offer her being my roommate at the hotel
having someone to stay with is much more fun :)
4Yes, you're right.
12Yes she is but hopefully not for long >v>
12He's been planning to "ditch" her all this time anyway.........
12I wish she'd just leave him but she's far too attached
4Oh, ok.
12I've just gone and told her everything I know over the phone
4I never know what's going on with other people so I try not to ask unless I don't understand something.
12Everything he's ever said, everything he's ever planned and done..
4I do care though.
same here RN
12Jess is apparently just a "rebound relationship " >v>
4Hi Bunnyfox
4Oh, Tier has had relationships before?
a WHAT?
Hullo, Ninetales
4I assumed they were both their first relationships or something.
12No he hadn't
4But it's none of my business ^^
12*hasn't
I like the way that sounds. Like, "TIER has had RELATIONSHIPS?"
4How can she be a rebound then?
12He just claimed that he loved me and because I loved Xai, he went on the rebound O__o
4Oh...
12LOL HORO
4I didn't know that either.
4But I forget stuff like this anyway.
12Yeh well there's a lot that people don't know about Tier becuase he hides it, he's another Falco
12He treats Jess the way I was treeated by Falco
4lol Horo, I didn't mean it to sound like that xD
4I'm the sort of person who sorts things out/says what's up in a relationship - and then things can get sorted.
4Like 'I'm not happy with <insert issue here>, let's talk' I don't stew up about it for months.
4But meh.
peer's having a field day
got me twice a while ago, now he's got kipi and feather
4wb both
Hey
meh - I really hope Tier won't be coming or paying a surprise-visit...
though I hope Jess is really coming
Thank ye
12He won't.
12He can't
the more we are, the nicer ;)
12He can't afford it nor does he know where we are.
12You guys will like Jess, when she's not around Tier, she's a lovely girl
4There is a ban list - isn't there Arti xD
12Unfortunately she's been so badly influenced by him as well
12Lol yes
the Ban list will be my hands ;)
4lol karate?
I don't have the brown belt in Judo for nothing ;)
4Hehe ^^ I tend to use unorthodox methods of fighting...but I've never been in a fight since I was 12.
/me coughs up a lolball
sounds like a very effective ban list
loool
hey, I know how to put someone on the mat by just using a single finger ;)
4I used to bite people if they tried to punch me (chavs)
4and they used to scream
4It made them go away though...
and I'm getting a few ... amusing ideas from "unorthodox"
4LOL not like that Horo xD
4I wouldn't just go and bite them, I'd bite their fist if they directed it at me...and that's why they stopped.
nah, I make people drop without actually hurting them
12Wow I didnt know you did martial arts!
12I did too but when I was 5 :>
4That sounds cool.
4Burnett's dad is a judo teacher at the community centre.
4He's also a hunter though...but I say nothing xD I can't.
12Hm
4Not a fox hunter...I told him, you toucha da fox, I slappa your face.
12I won't bother talking about it :>
12LOL!
4He's the kind that uses ferrets to kill rabbits dead with one bite...I still don't like it however.
12what take aways can you get that arent pizza, chinese or indian..?
4Thai
12FEATHY

IIRC there was a spanish takeaway or sth similar around here
4I wish they did Spanish takeaways :(
4LOL typed at same time.

chinese, german, bavarian, turkish
4Mexican, Arti?
4I think there's only restaurants of that though.

4lol
4Some pubs have happy hour from 6pm-9pm so it's not really an 'hour'.
Yeah

07and ratibork
07=P
you're all mean, scaring Kipi like that!
07what a name

Borkiosu is another
ostdrage being his nickname though
'-'
07LOL why?
yes, cheese dragon ;p
07WHY!?
07XD
No idea, he was going on about norwiegan words to me years ago, I picked those two and called him that
07lol fair enough
HAI mr OSTDRAGE, etc
07lol!
07you two are so random :3
cheese dragon is ostdrage?
he may set you on fire if you call him that, but I fully encourage you to ;p
/me puts into long-term memory
ost == cheese, drage == dragon
hai == shark
that's about all you need to know
takk == thanks
melk == milk
hai is shark as well?
o.oi
see, 4 years around borkiosu and I have learned a considerable array of norweigan
about 5 words!
4Melk is also milk in Dutch too, hehe.

Is it normal that a 3.6 GHz Core i7 can only transfer at 50 MB/s on Vista and a laptop with half the CPU power of a 1.7 GHz celeron manage 13 MB/s on linux?
hi
07that depends on what's being transferred o3o
07wwwwwwwwww
07afk tiem
exact same files over the exact same USB 2.0 connection
connection shouldn't matter though since all storage interfaces are capable of at least 100 MB/s
horo, depends on the source, destination, quality of the USB drivers and hardware
oh geez
/me sighs
/me noms Altair
The vista hardware is all good stuff (as stated v. high-end CPU, high-end motherboard, SATA interface to decent speed HDD)
the laptop is an Eee 1005
hi
07perhaps the data is just fragmented on the hard drive, if it's a big file o3o
nah, it's a new HDD which has had very little deleted, and as I said it's a fairly typical speed
in fact I'm not sure it's ever hit 65 MB/s. might have hit 60 though
baww
/me rages

12hello TS ^v^
You realise that isn't physically possible
hey 365
12My shadow form is stromger that a black hole
12Stronger*
soo wait, how long have you been waiting?
OMG JT JUST CAME BYE
and a black hole doesn't have a strength
12OvO
?
10o_o
12Thats what you think
/me 7blinks
a black hole is precisely zero volume. It has no size for it to have strength over
12I have the power to bend the rules of time and space
erm...
12Muahahaha...
you try to mess with MY element?
12OvO what?
I fear I can't allow that
12Im still me
:O
12XD
:P
12Im just stronger
well, what if I traveled to the moment you were created?
12and scarier lol
more powerful? more scary?
12I wasn't created
12:p
kid, you've NEVER really seen ME being pissed...
And bending the "rules" of time-space does not change the fact a black hole is zero volume. It wouldn't be a black hole if its volume was greater than zero
12OvO
12I was JK
12About the black hole thing

Hullo
/me tackleglomps Kipikio ':D Hai'
12wait a minute, I've seen a few pics like that, is she made up <Late>
i.e. it's large
I think anyway
let me check
Still £146
2itt over 9000!
12XD
1 metre tall
and it's the eiffel tower
/me shot
Still stupidly expensive for lego
not really
7Waaaaaaaait, during WWI, did England want to harm Germany during the Treaty of Versailles? o.O
most large lego sets are expensive
eiffel tower is 150-200m tall isn't it?
no england didn't, as far as I can recall
12Hase anyone heard of LDD?
eiffel tower is 300m ish
7Okay, BF.
France did want to harm Germany from what I recall, since France got its arse handed to it
12Lego digital designer?
England wanted to hurt them but not too much as we had a lot of trade with them
hmm
as it turned out that was the worst way to go
did we?
yes
and £146 is not expensive for the big legos. there was that big, detailed death star going for ~1 grand IIRc
ah yes
so we did
12g2g
o//
2o___O
2did someone say Death star?!!
/me 12telaports
o.o
.o.
2o.
.o
there's a Death Star in the Lego store going for Â£300-ish
o
.
it didn't even look that large from what I recall
I think the one I'm thinking of is bigger than that (IIRC it was Death Star II, had all the assembly structure sticking out)
they had a competition to build it on some radio breakfast show, some lego expert said he'd have it done in a few hours, took him more than three days
lolol

http://www.johndclare.net/peace_treaties1_Answer.htm <--- googling "treaty of Versailles" to see what the UK did in it, those comments don't make much sense...
7Wait, wasn't it that the majority of England wanted Germany to suffer, but their representative didn't?
yes
he wanted to be re-elected
/me pokes the next person that talks with a stick
/me doesn't talk
/me is shot AND poked
2lawl
/me huggles LL
apparently the British focus was on trade though, which I would guess involves giving the German people some degree of freedom
2o.
2o.o
/me huggles back
2bai drfy
Britain wanted to hit them hard, but not too hard as we wanted to still be able to trade
our route resulted in german hate and resurgence which made them powerful enough to start WW2 and gave them reason to. Yay for us
i thought it was nobody's route
It wasn't quite what we'd been wanting, but it was closer to ours than anyone else's
hmm
ironically anyone else's would've meant to WW2
*no
iunno
If we'd gone France's way germany would've been too weak to possibly come back and cause WW2
Go our way, they had reason and ability to
"we spend all these years in miserable conditions to just forgive them like that?"
well it WAS everyone's fault
well, this will sound a bit odd
/me 7blinks
Germany probably did least to help but you can't put all the blame on them
but was it really the average persons fault?
7Hey, all I asked was a li'l question.
Everyone, as in all the countries
huge arms races and the like
/me 7pokes Rora
6yeah?
i would have imagined that an arms race at that period of time wouldn't have had too much to do with the average person really :s
7Okay, I got what I'd like you to draw.
7An optional other requirement is to do it to music, which I'd be interested in.
average people were making them, but yes. Though I wasn't referring to the average person, as I said
6what do you mean, "do it to music"?
6I'm not animating o_o
"everyone" as in it was all the european countries' faults
7Draw while music is playing, see how it affects.
7I have just the music in mind. O.o
well I wasn't really sure, since I was talking about the average person and then you started talking about that
6quan, I always do that unless I'm in class
6ll
6lol
7o.l
7o.o*
7Well, okay.
7So; draw me with Lunatic (I'll get the pic) in my mouth, while listening to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A562-2Xo2sg
what I was trying to imply is that people in France and Britain might not have been peaceful if Gemany got off lightly, especially since it was around that time you had the Russian revolution, iirc
Russian revolution was the year before
still pretty recent, I think
and while that's true, I doubt it would've been too much trouble if they'd gotten off lightly
7Now I must think if Lunatic should be activated or not. X.x
hmm
maybe
especially if it was a greater focus on "fairly" than "lightly"
maybe
even just removing the war guilt clause would probably have helped a lot
6quan
6you know how I've told you I hate KH music?
6I like this one o3o
7o.O
7I see...
7The only question left is whether to have Lunatic be activated or not.
6when you decide that let me know
7http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/6/64/Sa%C3%AFx-Artwork.jpg <-- Reference pics to the right, Rora.
and that was pretty much it, yeah
hmm, maybe
The kaiser didn't help to prevent the war much but neither did anyone else really
p'ing off France != a smart move in the middle of a number of arms races
6hey, anyone know a good avi codev I can download?
6wmm wont play avi as video
VLC plays almost anything.
If you want to import an AVI into anything using DS or WFV, try ffdshow.
*VFW
VLC is great
iirc France had the largest army/most expensive army (can't remember which, but it was either something in between the two or one of those two) prior to WW1 and WW2
and also, virtualdubmod didn't recognise the codecs used by the mkv I want to convert, or something along those lines
Russia had the biggest by a huge margin
6ffdshow, that's what I had
had at least 100% on top of anyone else
hmm
all this talking is making my think that my GCSE history was balls
or at least the figure's something like that. they had, IIRC, at least 2 million soldiers on top of anyone else
my old history book used to be behind me but now it's down in my room. It also has these figures in it
we didn't even have a book
jsut lots of cutting and sticking ~__~
*just
not a textbook, exercise book
I had the figures cut and stuck in :P
oh
right
sounds like your course was very similar to mine then
indeed
it's nice to read about though
well that failed epically
tried using some program to change my .mkv to another format so I could try use vdub to resize it. all it's done it doubled video bitrate and it's still unreadable
hurr
lololol
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/
barkbarkbark
6quan, did you decide?
7It's either the activated or inactivated Lunatic. o.O
/me bunnehs a Roara
7Draw which one's easier. :3
6yeah, I was asking which you wanted
6I dont care what's easier
lol
6:P your choice
/me 7pokes everyone else.
7Inactivated or activated Lunatic?
07activated o3o
12o.o
12wb Aurora(late)
6thanks ^^
7LL, NS?
7Any thoughts?
12hmm?
07I has a baked potato
07o3o
/me pokes Kyu
12I DISAGREE! *hides*
12Inactivated :P
12whatever that means lol
7o_o
7When Saix isn't in his berserk state.
12oh, then Activated
7Ah, so it's decided.
/me slaps the "In" away
07crazy Quan it is!
7Me with an activated Lunatic (right-most image on that link) drawn to the music I linked.
7O_o
7Since when haven't I been? :3
07well for the first hour you were alive it was pretty docile...
07XP
7There's a reason I chose Deep Drive...
Horo: if resizing is ALL you want to do & can play mkvs fine,
7o.O
download mkvtoolnix and set a resize tag
wait, who are you?
and I downloaded mkvtoolnix. Couldn't see a resize option
click on the video track, and go to tab "track-specific options"
there's "format specific options"
yea, thats the tab
okay then, what do I do there?
is it supposed to be widesxreen or fullscreen?
wide
click the 16*9 checkbutton, set a new name @ the bottom, and click start muxing
click on aspect ratio: 16x9, or select display width/height with 16x9?
aspect ratio: 16x9 < prolly
x-x
12wb again XD
6quan, did you decide?
6before I DC again x-x
7Yeah.
6k
although, where have I defined what the new size will be?
6ik
6ok
6link the two again
ALTAIR
/me hugs
7http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/kingdomhearts/images/6/64/Sa%C3%AFx-Artwork.jpg for the art and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A562-2Xo2sg for the music.
it will just resize it to the right AR, similar Width or Height to original
DW, no detail is lost anyways
server is going down
wont matter much if you're full screening anways
6food o3o
12hai Altair~
ah, you misunderstood me then. Aspect ratio is perfect, there's no actual problem with the video, it's just that it's 1080i which is too high-bitrate for this laptop, I wanted to reduce to something closer to the laptop's screen size
hi
ugh
damn ping
Horo: You need to reencode it then, not simply use the mkv insta-scale.
need something to reencode it with then. Vdubmod couldn't recognise it
Oh so bored.
D:
/me hugs Altair
try handbrake?
Try putting it into gspot.
that might be me lol
That'll tell you what codec you need.
6lol
6ok
6codec didn't work
6I need to convert this file
6x-x
/me hugs back
I'm using command promt
prompt*
and pinging people lol
randomly cus' I'm bored
12hai NS~
12<random>
k
6Idk if it is a codec I need
6I import it to WMM, but wmm doesn't recognize the video portion, just audio
I'll first see what=
*what it makes of the new file, which is ever so slightly smaller
didn't like it though, and I g2g in a few mins
:/
I should think though, I'll be able to get it to work from here is gspot will work
ALTAIR
D:
._.
It feels like Friday.
12I wish it WAS Friday... x-x;

/me 7is trying to get 3 for the 2-one.

12lol
/me pokes Fire
7DAGNABBIT.

/me 7restarts.
12I have 34-ish Fire spells equiped during some missions
12awww D:
12how many total for you?
7 136.
12nice
/me has about 215 now, and the rest are HARD! x-x;
7I'm doing all of the combat-oriented ones.
12either I can't even get 1, or I have 2 and can't get the last one...
12ahh
7The ones with the blobs or emblems I'm saving until I can find a good route.
12lol
7Oh, and that emerald serenade one in wonderland.
12thats actually EASY
7I know.
12go to that little square area in the back, then FIRE FIRE FIRE XD
/me hides
7How about blizzaga and then fire? :P
7Sorry, Blizzara.
12no, I don't use that x-x
7No? Triple damage is quite nice. :3
12meh...
12Fire causes damage even after it flies away from you :/
7Dagnabbit, teleporting Saix. X3
12lol
/me pokes this to #KH
/me 7now needs to concentrate.
12ok
7What's annoying is that Saix can actually BLOCK your attacks. 8D
12yah x-x
/me would have 3 on BOTH of Saix's battles if he didn't block my Final Limit...
2GAAAAAH!
/me shivers in a corner
/me 7now has Saix's HP to half, and only about 3 hits.
2that was weird...I refreshed a page and the top of the page (which had a scary looking guy) flashed on my screen, one weird refresh, 0_0
12o.o
7Dang, I'm up to 7. D:
12D:
12How many until the 3 goes to 2?
7 10.
7X.x
7Argh, stop teleporting, Saix. X3
7He just preformed the same shockwave attack four times in a row.
7Make that five.
12lol
7 1 bar of HP LEFT. D:
7:D*
7Bah, back to berserk mode he goes. D:
12awww
7And I knocked him out of berserk mode with Fire. O_o
12LOL
7I BEAT HIM. :D
7BBL, dinner.
12lucky...it takes half of my Limit to do so...
12NICE! =3
7Meh, who knows, Saix might be my next pseudo-fanned-character. O_o

03Hey... does anyone here notice Google loading differently?
03Apparently it's only me and a couple kids here at my school that've seen it
She doesn't know what I do at my school
O_o
it has?
didn't notice
I'm just blind like that really XD
03it just has the Google logo and a search bar, and then to get the "images, news" etc you have to mouse over the top left
03well no, I'm curious if it's just here at the university or other places
03One of my friends tried it and it still loaded normally
03I'll upload a video :o
03wait, I deleted it >_>
Google looks no different to me
03OK
03must just be me then :/ weird
when I clicked the google icon thing when I searched something it said "this space was intentionally left blank" and then it changes right after O_o
or maybe I'm going insane.
I might be going insane.
03just type www.google.com in a browser
once I move my mouse it doesn't say "this space was intentionally left blank" =O

from a school friend?

2I was watching Avatar the other day and thought of Roara ovo'
6^^
2It was the most ironic thing really, I was watching where Zuko and Aang go to the firebending masters. And when I saw the dragons, I immediately thought "I bet Roara would draw those"

/me noms on it ^.^

12lolwhat?
12nvm
6sure whatever
12hey
6WHAT
6THE
6HECK
What happens to the students that are defeated?
o_o
12WTF?
6they get placed in lower classes? I dunno
/me shot for randomness
6it's just checking how advanced they are
No like
What if they're KO'd?
12XD
2o.o
2Then they're KO'd
Cuz I 3/4 KO'd my Golduck opponent, am I supposed to drag him off field or something?
07have some teachers do that o3o
07POST
12???
I'm doubtful to trust you Kyu, after the last time you told me what to do.
6ok
XD
12XD
6I'll try and make this as clear as possible
That's not a good sign..
12OvO
/me listen's up
12you're right
/me shot
12XD
6The battles are for teachers to see how advanced you are. You lose if 1. You are KO'd 2. If you refuse to fight any longer 3. The proctor declares it over, or 4. You revert to your human form
6if none of those happen, the battle is not over
/me wonders what the topic discussion is about no
2now*
6what do you mean, 3/4s KO?
Okay
I KO'd my character
12LOL
My field proctor already declared I was the victor
12Pylon!!
But my opponent cannot get up and walk off the field
Or something like that.
6then the battle is over. A teacher will take him to the medical facility, and you can do whatever to pass the time
THANK YOU
That was the answer I needed.
/me runs to post before going to bed

Of course
I've composed a song in my head
Violins, trumpets, etc
I'd like to write it down, but I don't know the notes
aww
07lol
/me bunnehs around kyu
07who doesn't make up songs in their head once in a while? XP
XP Indeed. Someday I'd like to hire someone to help me write it down though
12i don't
/me is attacked D:
Kyu, it's a really long piece. o.o 'twas inspired by Castlevania, FF,& the original Mercenaries game ost.
07lol o3o
starts with a violin solo, the beginning of which I made into my town tune of Animal Crossing
XP I would be proud, had I the knowledge and ability to write the whole thing down and actually listen to it be played.
Buuut I'll get to that someday. :3 It's one of my life goals.
Or Kyu
07?
Music stuffs. Composing, etc
12?
07i can read music but I don't know how to compose o3o
12perhaps someone can tell me for the 500th time what the o3o face is supposed to be
12i keep forgetting it
o.o How do you mean?
12which is mostly why i hate it so much lol
@ Kyu
07http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=o3o
DS D:
Oh
Uhmm... nevermind
12yeah and that's why i keep forgetting it
12usually when you look at a face, the lips is not where the nose usually is D:

07i mean
/me bunneh.
Stay home three week if you want
Just don't leave class early

about this family's house gets flipped upside down
"be ready. get informed."

EVERYONE BE PREPARED BECAUSE
YOUR HOUSE MAY FLIP UPSIDE DOWN!!!

02I mean EVERY port
Wow fail

o.o;
omg i have to tell you this dream i had!!!!
it so fits with that
02eck
so
in this dream
there was a walmart
02nothing at all
6o_O;;;
02no open ports
and right next to it was this place where you could take dead children
02unfortunately, my school doesn't give out torrents...
/me shot
it had this big banner "PLEASE BRING THE DEAD CHILDREN WRAPPED IN A BLANKET"
:/
6o_O;;;;;
12i wonder if they have the walmart logo on the ceiling of the coffin to advertise to the dead "when you become a zombie, shop at walmart"
02eh well
02CGI:IRC defeats their blocking purpose anyway
02so yeah
02xD
6O.O,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lol
02I find every way around teh filter lol
02I'm going to host a PHProxy soon

Win7 came this morning
12eww
now to be absolutely sure the computer is safe to update then set it going
why eww?
and there are over 500,000 objects in registry alone? o.o
or at least nearly 500K
12linux bettah
Linux doesn't play games. THerefore, my gaming rig has windows
Not much point in a gaming rig that can't play games, no?
/me coughs
12flash games?
12java games perhaps
/me hides
/me glomps
10xD
Heya ^^
02hiya
02lolback
02and hi Xeli
Gaming rigs are not for flash and java. the school PCs can run those
12indeed
12so imagine how well a gaming riq will play it
not that well, as it's still restricted to the same res, picture quality and refresh rate
so there's NO advantage whatsoever
02o.o
12i see
12enjoy your games
this laptop has the equivalent of a ~900 MHz celeron with a very cheap integrated graphics circuit and it runs most flash and java basically identical to the gaming rig with a hyperthreading quad-core 3.6 GHz with an okay discrete graphics card
/me puts on raegface
02rageface*
02god damn it lol
/me 6pants
I thought or reggae from the first one
*of
6urgh, finished a rather gruelling sprite x_X
02o.o
12http://notalwaysright.com/nature-not-osha-compliant/1776 <--- LOL
6yes it took two hours X.X
6XD
oh sure we could possibly make it regulation depth if we flattened the entire globe so it's all underwater
on second thought that might still be too deep
12priceless
I'd;'
*if she's asked just how deep it was, I'd've pointed at a jet in the sky and said "about as far down as that is up"
just for the look on her face
12lawl
best bit is it's more or less accurate
12probably
IIRC the deepest point is around 9 km, which is more or less 10,000 yards. 10K yards = 30,000ft, which is a fairly typical cruising altitude
02o-o
ohai
12hi sis
07Hihi
07I got worse today
12oww
07I was getting better then it got worse
12i hear that is how it goes
02lol
02aww
02...hard.
07its individual
07Like my brother didnt get worse, nor did mum
07Just me x.x
10:/
...
12heh i heard that sometimes it gets worse
I don't believe this
12just about everything is individual
I search for "deepest point" on wikipedia looking to find out the deepest part of the ocean
07lol....
10The challenger... thing?
10in that... trench
want to know what the top result is? (isn't not clean so I'll have to notice/pm)
10o3o
10i can imagine, thanks >_>
:P
07I think I know
07LOL
02hurr

Good night
The result I was looking for ended up fourth.
02lol
02k
07nini
12get better sis D:
Most fun incorrect result for a search I've ever had
02wait that didn't make sense ._.
12wikipedia at it's finest
10good you didn't go "I'm feeling lucky". Google style.
Lol
10or "additional images"...
02wat LOL
02xD
10I hypnotize kk
and the deepest point of the ocean is actually 10911 m, which is just short of 36,000 ft, even closer to the average cruising altitude
02xD
02wat
02wait what
12i see Horo wants to be a pilot :D
02WTF
02STUPID KEYBOARD

12i saw that one
10o-O
the virus scanner has taken nearly 20 mins on C:\Users\ so far and I don't think it's near finished
what's surprised me is it's not found a single threat so far
12heh
I would have expected in that 300-400 GB of crap to find at least ONE thing it thinks is a trojan or something
02lol
anyway, while I wait, guitar hero!

10You can see the difference even if you only have binary counting. In other words two possible things. Which means victory.
I didn't invent a time machine to win at gambling!
02hurr
02damn you
02-_-

02I will just go fiddle with HTML 8D
12whee back to the future
10Contradiction detected.
oddly
10Detector overload, please reboot
the virus scanner seems to be taking longer on the max. 20GB windows folder than it did on the C:\users\ folder which probably takes 1/4 of the 500 GB HDD
02lol eli

02eh
02that task was retarded D:
02I forgot how stupid the first task was
02meh need to go bye

Hi everyone!
Meeps
I have a newfound appreciation of ace combat songs
12o.o
the epic classical-theme combat tunes?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JANarGLRPbw
I dunno :}
briefing is good enough for me.
... how come Ace Combat 5 gets that and 6's briefing music was quite honestly annoying?
:\
/me looks up the AC6 briefing.
12!fortune
5Your fortune: Reply hazy, try again
12yay
I might've skipped less briefings if it had that
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQ-L-nxdEk
12-rev 3
this?
12!rev 3
!reverse 3
3
10o-O
Horo o.o
yeah, very similar to that, got extremely annoying rather quickly I found
Yeah I can see why
it's very repetitive
the actual mission briefing IIRC is similar but slightly different
the combat music though was truly quite epic
maybe it was a ploy to get people to play the actual missions more
Lol meeps
Skies of Liberation isn't it?
Fires of Liberation, at least for UK edition
Ah floofs
Fires of Liberation, then
hey, it's close, and I think some places may have called it skies
for some reason the AC series seems to have had a lot of local names
Well I wish I could play them on my own, but fail sight is fail - I played 5 through with Arrow which was awesome
He let me watch, something I love to do because I can't always play games like that by myself for several reasons ^^
wearing glasses for the whole game too much I'm guessing?
Lol well I can't see my own plane!
Like, where I'm aiming
which .. well, kinda makes you useless ;P
yeah, I can see why it would :P
lol
arharh
I heard Zero was good aswell?
I've been feeling bored lately ... perhaps I should finish AC6 on whatever difficulty I was on
Yeps
Oh Horo
And I've only actually played 6, the one on 360
why the change?
I was just kinda bored with the name?
I could change back
Oh okie
Was just wondering
=)
want to call me air wuff some more? =P
Air wuff!
Yes!
/me wuffs at Horo
oO
whut
I''m on an Eee
Ok
OH!
Now I get iiiit
also
Now I shall listen to moosik
and I shall play AC6 while my sister goes through GHIII on medium and Win7 installs on the desktop
and the GTAIV expansion The Ballad of Gay Tony is downloading also
Hm
thats some weird expansion name
THe first expansion was The Lost and Damned
Rawr
and Gay Tony was a semi-main character in TLAD
first time you meet him was amusing. It's in a spa, and he's naked, but you can't see any of "that"
it then goes on for a few minutes in the classic cartoon style of there always being SOMETHING JUST large enough to hide it
until right at the end they just put it in full view
Hey Androo
bah, Ace difficulty in a weak plane means it's like OHK on me from guns
still, this plane's ridiculously manoeuvrable and has what are pretty much the best missiles in the game. And lots of them.
Hm
Su-47, but a slightly custom version which makes it about as strong as a newspaper but as manoeuvrable in normal conditions as other planes are under high-G mode
LOL!
Newspaper
in high-G mode this thing does backflips. And then stalls due to lack of speed
and okie =)
I wish I could play now XD
this plane is actually an xbox live download which you've got to pay a little for, but hell it's worth it if you have the money to spare and are actually good enough to not get hit
unskilled pilots will still get hit often even with this manoeuvrability
And I take it
since the plane's defenses aren't the greatest that won't benefit unskilled pilots well
;p
But to ones with experience it'll do wonders!!
On the lower difficulties damage is reduced so it isn't too much of a problem, but unskilled pilots will be better off in other aircraft, yes
skilled pilots though will be rolling around the missiles and backflipping after passes to make another pass and score a kill almost immediately
oh, and the best bit? it's covered in shiny pink hearts
o-O
12i called her pawkie once and she called me evil D:

02mIRC is lagging like hell
06ocean
02think I have too many server windows open
06I'M ON OCEAN O-O
02hurr
02o_O

02you're using nest
13:/
02lol
02god damn lag
aurora, you're on nest.
02argh
02brb
06I am?
06I sign onto ocean all the time though

go back or i'll flatten you into a pancake, repeated he.
Aurora, you are NOT on ocean ;p
you would not be here if you were
06I guess
02lol
06I thought I always connected to ocean thoug
06h
06sduhfd
02xD
irc.lugia.us has both nest and ocean in its server list
you get directed to whatever one is online
and although nest goes up and down faster than a bird can flap its wings, ocean is more stable ;p
except when drunk employees sever fiber cables
rbr, work
06I usually sign onto ocean.systemnet though o_o
06oh jk
06for mIRC, I put irc.lugia

06I need sleep

02bye
07bai
12It's slightly more blue than silver yeh
2night Roara
12It looks like the type of shade you'd see if Lugia was under the sea
it does have a more stronger blue overtone yes
07well don't take a bath with it O.-.o
/me hides
12Wow the material looks so nice
12Is it soft?
12Crap wtf someone at door

2cya guys~
12bye soy
12Wow, package for Xai, an Nvidea ENGTX275
heh, fun
07hm
02;o
07i'm not familiar with how good the card is based on that numbering system lol
02lol
12The box is MASSIVE
it has lots of numberas and letters, so it must be good!
/me hides

12I think Xai got this one mostly because it supports 3D
12*3D vision
07ah
07it's the mid range one o3o
07I have the same video card o3o
Does it support the latest OpenGL version?
heh, this video card seems quite buggy, or the drivers anyway
02hm
02nVidia?
02I remember it's one for overheating your laptop
12You think that's buggy? Xai's ATI card that he just bought a replacement for used to shut off randomly and it's a known bug as well O_o
12They said you just have to take it back if it starts doing that, was brand new XD
12so he went with Nvidia.
07lol

07</nerd>
12That's an awesome diagram!

12*thought
07lol
02bbl dinner
12Wow it just keeps going
02bbl dinner
well, when MS paint goes "Failed to get clipboard data" when taking screenshots, the video card reports your widescreen monitor does not support widescreen resolutions
and when you do force 1440x900, it cuts off the top 50 pixels of that screen
12O__o
12That's pretty bad
eventually leading to a blue screen as more things fail
02:/
07lol
graphical corruption showing in games, game output freezing till you fill screen it, windows key out, go back in, put it to window mode to recover output
etc etc, all sorts of crazy stuff like that ;p
07the new Penny Arcade strip is pretty good o3o

And no, the company pays for my manager to make the call
oh good, i thought chu daid
*to
02:O
So my dad is saying that if the company saves money by calling my landline, they would have more money to pay the developers >>
12So why is he going on about it being expensive?
12..........
<yayz for CLICHE TAIM!!!!!> "TAKE ME TO UR LEADAH
12Your dad is pathetic
But, on a good note, the shadow of a 737 just fell across my room while it past through the sky XD

04One word: Spore
12It's standard for all companies to call a mobile if they have it
/me flees
oheyz. who wants my swine?
04I am suddenly craving the Spore expansion, Galactic Adventures
And I know Arti, but as I said, my dad probably spends about 40% a day on his mobile phone and most of that isn't even company related calls >>
04Because then, I can design an adventure about VCS!
02:O
04With a race other than human however...
02:U
02Anyway
bler. i gtg
02I'm going back to figure out this freaking encryption thing on HTS D:
:l
02D:
04Dragon RP, I know
02nuuu
02bye Conscience
04Cya 591
baiz, pplz...
02If you don't know what HTS is, don't ask.
/me huggles everyone tightly and poofz
04I won't
02If you REALLY do want to know, PM me.
02Although I'm not sure you'll really want to hear it...
02xD
02Arti lol
02You need a new quit message xD
02Articuno is an overgrown bag of blue peas. The cookies will set you on fire!)
02that old lol
04Uhh...NS
04There is really nothing I can post about
04BTW
02hm?
04Actually, don't worry about it
02in Dragon RP :U
02xD
02argh I never really bothered looking into Encryption
/me REALLYREALLYREALLYREALLYREALLY wants Spore Galactic Adventures
02and I haven't done the Basic challenges for SUCH a long time I've actually forgotten how to do the harder ones D:
02Pirate it :U
04NEVA
02Torrent + Download = win
04Besides
02then fare with not getting it :P
04My birthday is in a month
02k
02well happy early birthday
04Plus, I need both a new graphics card, and maybe a new PC in general...
04ty
04My pC is so SLOW!
04PC*
04and brb
02k
02aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh I hate MySQL!
12lol
02o-o
02...and PHP too,
02I need to "restudy" encryption/decryption D:
02After this, I realise how much I suck at that particular area
02hi Horo
moo
02rawr
02Damnit, I really shouldn't be on HTS today D:
04back
02wb
02I'm still stuck on this
04ty
04lol
02And I'm thoroughly annoyed
/me wants to learn to use WMM
02Haven't had anything to do with encryption for about 6 months now
02lol WMM
02It's not that hard
02Use logic, and you can use it
02:P
04Yeah, thing is I have nothing to use it for
04That's why I don't know how to use it
hi :)
02FUUUUUUUUU
02D:
02BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH
04Hopefully in the future, there will be things I use it-
04WHOA!
04Calm down
02DDDDDDD:
04You're reminding me of creature stage
02I booted my fairly dead computer
04freaking crashes
02and I got a BlSoD
02yeah
04BISwhat?
02but BlSoD is fairly serious
02BL
02not BI
02Black Screen of Death
04What does that mean?
02-_-
04as in, what is so wrong with it?
02You know what BSoD/Blue Screen of Death is?
/me facepalms
02http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Screen_of_Death
04OH BLUE screen of death yes
04But not black
02what the hell
02why did that even happen?
/me REBOOTS
some newer versions of windoze have new colours
02...fffs
02Another BSoD
02BlSoD*
I've had a red one and I think there's even some more fu colours like green
02;O
02there's a Green Screen of Death for XBOX 360s
I would also like to point out Bl can stand for both black and blue
02eh
02well, BSoD is used for Blue Screen of Death
/me wants to both use WMM, and be able to make awesomeoe signatures/avatars/wallpapers
02BlSoD is used for Black Screen of Death
02wat
02wat
02wat
04?
wmm for signatures?
02Drake, lrn2pirate Photoshop :U
o.O
02lol
04-_-
02nah
02PS CS3 ftw
04I have Photoshop on my laptop
02CS4 is fairly retarded lol
02which version?
04CS4
04NNGH
04But I don't have my Laptop atm
04It's at freaking school getting repairs
02;o
02Your school gives you laptops too?
02Like, you have to buy one?
04Yeah, the school gives it too us for fees
04I got a Mac
02eww mac
04It's programs crash all the time
02^Why I hate it
04Same
02Personally, I can't use anything else besides Vista and XP
02and I hate Vista
04I'm glad I have my own PC
02I have XP on my laptop
02xD
04The thing is...
use Win7
02...Macs suck.
02I want Win7
02except downloading it from a torrent
02would kill me
04The reason I want to learn to use WMM and make sigs/avis/ect is I got some massive inspiration from seeing some peoples adventure advertisements on the Spore Forums
02and I know I have to get my laptop reimaged soon
02:O
Win7 amazed me with performance increase in games and other places
02k
02lol HoRo
02Horo*
02well
04And I want to make my own Adventure based around VCS
02it's said that Win7 is good
Previously, Oblivion in stereoscopic 3D was ~7fps
04Eh?
now it's more 20-30 on the same machine
02and atm, it's the safest
02...meaning the safest from cracking/hacking
02Because its' new lol
02But it'll get to WinXP's rank in a couple years or so :P
04I apologise, but I am absolutely lost when it comes to new PC/hardware/ect
02lol
/me rages at her other computer
02lol hi TS
04Because I have had this PC for what, 6 years already?
02AAAAAAAAAAARGH
04Hey Timey
02personally, I want to kill this BlSoD
02D:
04lol
02hm
02I wonder what's wrong?
04Well, if it is already "of Death" then you really can't kill it
/me flees
02LOL
02^^
02hi TS
02hm
02I haven't loaded this comp for about a year
02yeah
04OH, hey TS
04NS
02?
04Another reason WMM is alien to me is because I use UnFreez for all my animating
02lol
04I would actually use WMM if I didn't have UnFreez
02I've never used UnFreez before lol
02I barely know what it is
02:O
04UnFreez is kinda difficult
04But easy at the same time
02WMM is retarded, end of story
02as are most other movie making programs
04Because they NEED to be GIF. files
04You open Windoes Explorer and UnFreez...
02especially Adobe Premiere Elements
02lol
02Hey Drake
02to make your computer faster
04?
02Go delete System32 8D
/me flees
04Dun worry
02xD
04If my PC can't handle the new graphics, my Pop is gonna fuse me and my sisters PC's
02xD
02go delete System32 though
04He made most of the PC's he uses himself, or so my Nan says
04I have absolutely no clue what that is
02LOL
02well
04>.>
02it's in C
12don't listen to nightbunneh D:
02xD
04Uhh...
02NO U
02Okay
04Que?
02But don't do it, Drake
02It'll kill your computer xD
04...
12so no one really wins
/me is lost in this conversation
02System32 contains most of the dll files you need to run your computer's programs
/me gives Lyon a sprite :)
04But I can kill Rai
02I think it also contains explorer.exe
/me flees
02But I can't remember
02hurr
02But then Seran will kill you :P
04And don't even think about Kommander Kulez
/me flees faster
02xD
02THEN I'LL GET MYSELF AND KILL YOU 8D
04lol
04Then I'll get Dad
02Or use my super h4x powers and pwn your face
04And he'll turn of the PC
02LOLOLOLOLOLOL
02xD
04I win cuz:
04"CAN'T TOUCH DIS!"
/me flees
02xD
/me then h4xxes Drake's computer
/me gets a new PC and never comes on TST again so NS can't track him
02I has your IP :P
02203.33.160.104
04OH SNAP!
02:P
/me flees to the next dimension
12night has my ip as well sadly :(
02xD
04lol
02wait I do?
02O wait yes I do
/me pings Umbreon and gets his IP
04I have a life inlike you]
/me flees even further
mailto:Seran@c122-106-107-168.rivrw6.nsw.optusnet.com.au <-- 122.106.107.168?
02lol yes
12Lyon
02but that doesn't really matter
02since my IP changes a lot
02fudge.
It's surprisingly easy to get people's IPs
02Exactly.
04Yush
and it won't change so long as you remain connected .. *cough*
02xD
04But I don't really even know what that is
02yeah I know that lol
04But WTH
02Unfortunately I don't have an onion router lol
12later
02no
02no
02no
02YOU'RE NOT USING SVSNICK ON ME D:
/me stabs Umbreon
/me imagines an epic final battle of the end of DQ4 only in a game format
/me 's head explodes from pure awesomeness

04This is Dark Gaia in Sonic Unleashed...
04"Ims firin' ma-BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
04Ima*

Morning, not here long, will be going out soon
12i'm having a random fight with snowsong o-o
02:/
04lolwut?
12goes way back
04Hmm. Who do you think would make the best Deltora Quest game? As in, which company do you think would succeed in it if they put actual effort into it?
02?
02yes Drake?
moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?
/me pokes his other post
/me sighs
02?
02eh
02I dunno
02I'm still busy
02so yeah
04If I do make and Adventure about VCS, what general race do you want Rai and Seran to be?
02?
02...I love my avatar.
02...WHAT
02what races ARE there?
04As in Dragon/Monster/ect
02:O
04Just the general idea
02well
02just make everyone human lol
02keep to the original storyline
02etc.
04Trust me
04Hey RN
4Heya
/me hugs
http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/funny-pictures-cat-wants-brains-or-tuna.jpg ?
04Just keep in mind that it will be roughly human sized
Yay halloween party is still going ahead! :D
4I wish I had a halloween party to go to - wasn't even allowed to go trick or treating when I was younger lol
lol
4Not that I'm bothered - if I wanted sweets I could buy them at the shop
XD
two numbers that add to make -1 and multiply to make -234
4lol @ the pic Michael
4I keep hearing the number '180' all the time, I'm cursed
4(like in FD)
4In my bank I saw a payment of £180 - in the shop just now they asked me for £1.80 O-O
LOL
4I hate that number XD
My bank is being very retarded lately
4Howcome?
4Mine are quite lenient which surprises me
02:O
02hi RN
Well I purposely left £30 in there for yesterday and today (yesterday Snooker, and today halloween party) checked the account yesterday and it said £45.84 OVERdrawn o.o
/me sighs
04I'm gonna play Spore
04Make a race that Lyon can be
4heya
02wat
04Cya
04As in VCS
04Bai
don't they normally have a delay before the money is actually there?
No I left £30 in my bank from my last payment
4or go in and explain to the manager...depends what bank you're with though.
that doesn't mean the money is in your account immediately
Horo
4Most of them it's just money money money, people = nothing, but mine is ok.
The money WAS in the account
did you make sure?
Yes
how?
..
what method did you use to be sure it was there?
I checked the bank like 5 days before I was to take it out
Then check on the day I wanted it
The money was in my account, but £75 has been taken out at some point
02brb
And I know that £75 wasn't the money I paid to Arti for the train tickets (the statements show that)
02back
/me targets Articuno and tacklehugs her
so someone's probably accessed your account if you have no explanation whatsoever
Possibly, going down the bank today to check
4Remember they usually close at 12.
Yeah I'm leaving at 11 :>
4Hi
lol, the new order system of one of my favourite online stores is quite...funny
The aproximately remaining processing time for your oder is about 1.2 working days.

Right time to go

happy halloween foos
12I'm drawing a group pic

12Ok I have to charge my camera battery for a minute
02k
/me gives Arti a cookie
-1, 3, -5, 11 ...

07I talked to the borkisu earlier
12You know what, I've not had any cookies for about a year..
07Meeps why?
/me o.o's at the tray
02well

4Maybe it's airguns.
4Hi Xeli
12It
12It's air guns yeh
okay, so for some reason installing Win7 apparently reversed the SATA port priority in the bios or something
Getting back on laptop for abit
4BB guns are soooo heavy to reload >.<;
4or maybe I'm just weak...
now to look at the wip pic

12Altair..
12your custom message thing as well? lol
12Well.. maybe I can allow that actually
Finally got Steam back
03Oh yeah

I prefer being in a team
ah yes, I need to DL steam on the new desktop.

4why does the dog look at my mouth when I'm eating? >>
4Because he wants to steal whatever I've got? grrr
because he wants your foods
4He's got his foods though. Greedy thing.
our dog does that as well. It's also a good thing he's not taller since he'll already lick the edge of the table to get things we spill
4Mine routinely hoovers the floor after a meal or snack
lol
4With his mouth....it would be funny to see a Jack Russell doing the hoovering....

I think Crysis's FPS counter is lying to me
because that is way too smooth to be 15 FPS
12I've been taxed too much again this month >v> I even called the freakin' tax office and they said it would be sorted before next pay..
12Lost about £120 in two months
12Thats £120 each month by the way
o.O
12I hate to admit this.. but I'm starting to get used to the awful theme they gave Lugia on Soul Silver
12I just can't deny my love for anything Lugia
12Can I?
12No matter how much I hate it, I can't help but start to like it
12as for Ho-oh's theme.. that is just fantastic..
12Maybe a bit fast but I love it
wait, are SS and HG out?
o.O
12In Japan yeh
ah
Announcement -> release times seem to be getting much shorter these days
12Yeh <3
Mass Effect 2's formal announcement was less than half a year ago and it's released in January. It makes you feel behind because you didn't realise it was out until you find out just how short the times are getting
12I know it was only in Summer that I reported SS and HG
*pokes silence*
hihi
/me sneases
... my god
steam wants me to run it as admin
in Win7 the easiest way to do that is going into compatibility options and setting that
then it refuses to run because compatibility mode is on

12never had that happen before o-o
12i've had an invisible caps lock going on though
12everything was in blasted caps including the numbers and i couldn't turn it off >_>
That's some weird keyboard mode, I turn it on by accident every so often, but I don't know how, so I can't turn it off again.
12hmm

12i have a weird yearning to play magic the gathering online
04Is Kira gonna threaten Selena's life?
I might play some Ninja Gaiden 2
04Is that why you wanted her bio?
07basically she's allowing the group to rescue her and Septimus to stall for time
Wanting my brother to come back home so I can kick his ass on Soul Calibur 4 :/
04Ah
07because they would be forced to head back to where they were before
04I see
04Interesting

I can't find a wireless network card in any of the shops near, or even far from me >>
12What do you want one?
Morning, little sister.
I presume you mean why would I want one ;> And it is either using a wireless network card to connect to the router, or buying a 30 meter LAN cable...
I would rather go wireless, I am currently connecting through my dad's laptop's wireless connection
12* why do you want one yes
12So the router is not anywhere near you?
No, it needs to be connected to the phone line and the only point is downstairs

12i thought i was good enough to go to my friends house for a short series of tournaments
12the atmosphere in their house
12omg.. every breath was a huge struggle
07oh ergh
12i dunno why
12but the air in their house
12was excessively heavy and humid
Articuno!
Did you see the bluebath?
12?
http://vyl.avians.net/misc/bluebath.jpg
12A bath with blue water.
There was a leak.
I put dye in the tank to find it.
Now all the hot taps are running blue water.
12-v-
12LOL
12Well that's somewhat awesome
The leak turned out to be in a mains riser...
/me petpets Arti
It's done some damage to the house.
Corroded wireing, warped and peeled the kitchen ceiling.
I think the blue dye ran out after the bath though, the taps should be providing clear water again noww.
12Sorry for silence
12I'm writing up a forum topic about the meeet

laters y'all
hello
14Hello.
14Rar!
hello
14whats up?
hello
nonthing really
14ah.
/me 14gives off a sigh of bordem and wanders around.
/me 10pokes vulcan
14>.=.<
14hello.
10im bored
what else is ew lol
new*
boo
6Master!,
/me 6bows to him.
6Welcome.
Hello everyone !
6Good, getting more Dragons in here...
6More to Consume...
did u get wc3 yet?
the battle chest?
6No...for the upteenth time.
hello
10hy
6I'll try to get it today.
Oh , numerous people on the chat !
What's the actual topic ?
No idea
6nothing, just talk about what you want, basicly.
/me 10yawns
Harry Potter #3 on the T.V. now...the French channels are always retared compare to the Swiss ones...
/me 6flicks his tail swiftly around Shadow and constricts him with it.
10crabs he tail and flips him over
Don't ask me why , it's maybe due to the Swiss richness...
/me 6gives off a grunt as he hits the ground. He rolls backwards onto his feet, using his coiled tail around Shadow to spin him.
6Ah.
10y do you try to kill me
6I dont try to kill you.
6If i tried to, You would've been Dragon sushi by now....
It's spinning time ?
/me 6extends his Razor-sharp Wings.
/me 6Motions them In and Out, his wings acting like Scissors.
Dragon around there ? That's a good thing , I'll prove that they exists to the whole world if I catch them...Or not , money has killed me since a long time ago...
And not only me.
So I let you the freedom that the Nature gives to any animal.
6Then show them it out of Knowledge.
6Protect it with your Life....
6It may be the last in the world.
Any animal , but not humans , because they limit themselves to control the world.
/me 6Nods.
You don't know how I could be if I see a Dragon hiding at home...neither do me...
Maybe it would be a nice opening to a new life , trying to protect this Dragon to Humans' madness....
...But oh well , we killed them all in the past , they had no chance against us.
6True, but even then, it's Nearly-Impossible to.
6There will always be One Human that doesnt Understand the Richness of Having Such an Organism.
I suppose they were really there some time ago obviously.
6Yeah.
6But again, Human Stupidity wiped them out.
10bbl
6k.
Right , Humans are pretty egoists creatures , so they take all that they can , and don't care of others...We have never changed at all about this...
Did we really evolve ? We are the more clever creatures around there , we have power , but not reason...
We can make the world explode if it could be a nice money earning maneer.
It's not , and it's way too expensive to do that , so we don't.
6Yep.
Ethic isn't the real question now...when you speak about evolution...
i just devoured cynder 10 mins ago..
a nice and slow pace
We think like thousand years ago , but have way more power now , and we still don't think , because of the humans who control the others.
o_o'
It was a good thing to unite forces , it becomes the better weapon of the human second to his cleverness...
...Wait , I'm speaking to say nothing , don't I ?
I wonder what the politics , the world masters , can think of just right now...
6So does that mean you're paying attention here more, Basil?
...They maybe think to what to do tommorow , the work , their families...
well...
6Yeah.
6You cant Unite the whole World....it's Improbable.
cynder will arrive soon..
Now we think so individually that we can't act by ourselves. It would be useless , out of sense and they will close our mouths.
6Utterly Improbable. I mean, IT can happen, but there will always be that one Place where they want to have their own beliefs.
vulcan
Allright , you get it.
6I heard, Master.
cynder will arrive in here soon
/me 6Nods.
Communism , the actual opposite of the actual system , has failed huh.
6I'm staying here then. I want to meet her.
6Yeah.
6But since it was Tainted by the Old Leaders such as Stallin, Everyone hates it.
shes trying to get on atm..
6k.
Because Humans just CAN'T apply this thing without any problem , even with everybody with them...individual belifs and profits are the main things , we think of others a the very last issue.
as*
These guys have power to control reasonly and make their better world , but they prefered profit and totalitarism...
had*
6True.
A bad thing , we could see if communism was a good thing or not if Stallin didn't waste everything.
6Yep.
...Maybe it's the only reliable display of what this thing does when people are concerned.
...Well , I'm speaking of politic things AGAIN , I waste my time speaking about this clown's show.
Let's switch on Spyro then , I'm playing again the 3 on PS1 , are you playing any pyro game recently ?
Spyro* , shame on me...
6Not Currently.
The 3 on the PS1 is the first Spyro game I ever played. I spend so much time on this one....
I wonder how long it will take for me to finish again this one..
And I'm trying the glitches , bugs in the games are plenty fun.
well just played through ten this morning
...when it's about game mecanisms , about memory it's less fun...
anway i'm back finished typing up part of the show
ten ? I haven't this one , I can only find him on Wii...50â‚¬ the game...
If not more.
I can't find ANB at all in the game stores...
ANB is easy to find around here
6...
vulcan!
ten only on ps2 and wii
In the U.S. ? It's not a given thing in France.
3errmm
3...
3I wouldn't do that if I were you.
/me 14nuzzles against her lovingly and lays down next to her.
Spyro is not a know franchise here...at all , just look at the French forums about Spyro...all empty.
14o.=.o who?
3you
...
........ the graphics in TEN are ugly >_>
3o3o
3:>
3I feel like im gonna barf right now

I'm speaking about the old demo I was getting in a PS2 magazine...But I stopped take him.
14Too much candy! I knew it!
/me 14sighs and lays on his side, leaning away from his mate.
I have A Hero's Tail demo on these CD's.

...Right...a good thing for dentists.

brb
Mine isn't , it's a demo , but it's pretty short...
I still prefer my old PS1 Spyro games.
... a hero's tail freezes on the 3rd home world alot -_-
they're fun never get tired of them
It look like The horrible one on PS2...Enter the Dragonfly...so much problems with this one.
4Spyro sucked after the original three
I'm NOT getting that game no matter what
4when ANB came out, I saw potential
Mine wasn't THAT freezy...but it's so sloooooow to load...
yeah same here but then TEN .......
4then they made a pointless sequel (Ten) and a LotR rip off (DotD)
12...
3-throws up-
12sick color gone
12XD
DotD wans't such a bad game for me , but yes , not as epic as the old ones , I still laughed a lot about him.
/me 12gives vulcan half of her candy
4Now, for gameplay
12: p
4DotD wasn't halfbad
14Those betetr be wrapped...
/me 14takes the candy.
4Repetitive, but at least you can look around

The cinematics...I don't know if it's the French actors but it was so funny when it shouldn't...
4Storyline...it got punched in the face
4Ignitus looked like a pedo with every cutscene
12they are.
/me 12gives him a pumpkin carved in his face.

Hey Altair

Can I delete your topic?
?
After Shiny posted in the HSS board
I realised there WAS 2 topics
xD
Oh lol
Sure
Thanks
Heh.
That oekaki was a pain in the ass >_<
:/
/me hugs Altair
How did you retrieve it though?
Well, I got lucky
:O
Before the oekaki data deleted itself, I had backed everything up
However I couldn't restore it o_O
So I had to manually edit the backup...
D:
Eventually it imported and profit occured
Ah cool
Well
LOL
D'you want to back everything up every week or something?
what?
I forgot to change the main link
In the Oekaki settings
And eh
I'll monitor the Oekaki data
And all the permissions are messed up
brb
Back
wb
When we finally get this domain, we need to settle down in one place XD
xD
And link with TST
ty
yeah
/me prods
I want a CGI:IRC ;D
Hopefully the site will be unblocked at my school
Because so far, zzl.org and exofire.net one have been unblock :D
unblocked*
It should be
hopefully
Eh damnit
Especially since we will have a .net address
Shiny got his Wii taken away, I think
or .com
.-.
.net
ok
Damn
This isn't good, is it?
Shiny doesn't have a PC?
He does
But he's grounded from it
Not at all >_>
ugh
D:
I hate it when my parents do that
They still try to do it lol
It's in the Regular Community Member Board
the ITT Leaving/Returning topic
I replied already
I'm gonna get a iPod Touch... that will be profit
:|
xD
eh, I can administrate not too badly
I feel bad for him, I know what it's like >_>
But I seriously don't make a good mod xD
Yeah, same.
NS your fine at both
I am?
You just flame too much LOL
anyway
Yeah
yeah lol xD
Am I able to back up the Oekaki and Forums too?
You can back up the forums via the Admin CP
However
I can only back up both
When we set the new host up, I'll show you how
k
I can currently back up the forums
but not the er, Oekaki
I think
xD
Uh
Yeah
And you should really change the topic in #opers
xD
Why did Shiny get banned? :(
from using the Wii
/me waves at the Altir
er
I dunno
He said a slip up or something
I think it's at school as well
ergh
>_>
Tbh
I don't want to reveal ho-ohrealm.net when it comes up to anyone until Shiny gets back D:
Yeah, true
No one who's not already on the site
Shiny should be happy :D
regged*
xD I think he is
We need more members too
Yeah
Hopefully we can put ourselves onto google xD
From 6am this morn to 3pm this evening, not one page had been used o.o
On another note
o_O
?
Well that's generally the time I can't be on
The new dedi server idea is working great, it hasn't gone down in about a week o.o
6am to 3pm my time lol
what?
what dedi server?
dedicated server
dedicated to IRC
ah...
still on your computer?
yeah I know 6am to 3pm your time
If it's my time, I can get on anytime

Well yeah, your most likely sleeping at that time LOL
;o
nice
the main problem is that when your server goes down
is that the services go down too
It shouldn't ever, in theory
Well yes
Only one set of services can run
yeah
sadly
The only time it will go down is when power goes out or internet goes out
xD
I turned off updates, and I try to avoid router reboots XD
xD
your router reboots? lol
I can't keepmy internet on 24/7
keep my*
I can
lucky
I reboot it when I get b& from CoD servers
LOL
Everyone thinks I hack ><
but yeah
xD
CoD
Can you?
Well yes, but I don't
I'm just good XD
Well idiots lol
xD
hackthissite.org is fun 8D
CoD also pings a log
yeah XD
xD
lulz
it's even funnier

I remember once
I was trying to work

^o^
04http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp98/FireEmblemFanEX/Flippa-1.png
04There it is
04But I need a better name
awww its so cute!
^^
04Thanks
:p
04If I do the other 2 starters I'll show you them as well

^^ awesome
/me hugs back
04Almost finished the Grass starter
04http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp98/FireEmblemFanEX/GrassStarter-1.png
04Grass Starter
sorry
was away
04It's ok
^^ heh that one is really cute too
04What do you think of the Grass Starter?
04Thanks
^^
04Now, for the Fire Starter
what are they about?
04A hack of a Pokemon Game me and a friend are doing
^^ really thats kewl
whats it gonna be like? :o
04Vinyl (Grass) is based of a Velociraptor, Flippa (needs a better name) is based off a Sea Serpent
04Well, it's difficult to explain
what is the name of the fire one/
04But I am writing the plotline currently
04Firrel
^^ thats really kewl
04If you want to know the storyline...
04Read this topic
04http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,31/topic,4310.0
04It's the plotline of it
04*work in progress*
what about Relicto?
for the water
04Relicto?
i just looked up sea serpent mythology so it kinda goes hand in hand
04Explain how you got it.
i combined two different names i found
wikipedia :D
04The neames?
04names*
oh hold on
04K
Some cryptozoologists have suggested that the sea serpents are relict plesiosaurs, mosasaurs or other Mesozoic marine reptiles, an idea often associated with lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster.
relict and plesiosaur
i combined relict and io from plesiosaur
:3 you dont have to use it tho im just trying to help
oh wait
Relicto not relictio
or whichever
04Ah
04Maybe include Scillia into the name?
again you dont have to use it im just trying to help
04The Scillia is a greek sea serpent
would be a long name, i was going for short
04But your still a great help
04Any help is appreciated
Relictillia?
04But yeah
idk
:p
thanx
04Relictillia...
04Hmm...
04You're right, too long
yeh
04Maybe Scillio
sure~ whatever you want
tho you could have come up with that without my helo :p
04I think I might go with Scillicto. What do you think>
04?
hmm
its what you want
04No, actually it's not
but i notice that the s and the to if they were removed it woudl be the same forward or backwards
cillic
04It's what is good for the Pokemon
which makes my eys go bleh @.@
04Wow. Good point
yeah
04lol
04Hey MH
=D
plesio scillia plescilla
how bout Plescilla?
kinda long ish maybe....
04Yeah a bit long
04Plesia?
04Plescia*
again im not the firm decider here :p
so idk what to say
04Heh, well I still want your opinion on it
04Do you yourself like the name? Is it easy to pronounce? Is it fitting for the Pokemon it's designed for?
it seems that it should be a name with a p tho
since Loch Ness Monster carries the letters l m n then o but not p
idk :p i have wierd thinking
04lol
it kinda looks like it would be said pleshia
04Hmm...
or pleskia
Pleskia
04Well, anyone knowing about Greek Mythhology would guess it's based off a Scillia
i guess i like that one cause the pronouciation is clear
04But your right
04So Pleskia it is
^^'
again if you dont like it dont humor me
04No, I'm not humoring you
so is it just as early where you are? its two in the morning here
04This is a serious discussion
:3
04lolno. It's 7pm here

lol, 190 lbs is just around 86 kilograms^^
6LOOOOOL
it MAY be the HIGHEST burger, but NOT the LARGEST or even HEAVIEST burger :P
6well, drf did join chat few minitues ago
we had one in germany - around 120 kilograms in weight and 3 meters in diameter
that was around 264 lbs :P

Want a good burger? IT's the one thing this town does well.
12lol
For we have Nanny Jannets. Sellers of nice burgers.
one of our Burger King restaurants makes an offer: "We server regular Whoppers, Double Whoppers, Triple Whoppers....or n-Whoppers. Decide yourself what n is standing for. Current record: a 38th Whopper"
Made with actual cheese! Not processed plastic.
12i'd want to call up poison control

6however you want o3o
6secret menu ftw
6not so secret anymore
brb again
^^
know what I prefer the most? Delicious belgian fries
6ugh
6I want food now
those are double-fried, freshly cut french fries
very crunchy, a bit darker and bigger than regular fries - and MUCH more delicious. And very healthy in fact^^
12i want avast to finish scanning
Aurora, I have no idea how you might look like, but saving and starving is not good for a diet
6I'm not starving ._.
6I had an omelet and raspberries and a big glass of milk just a couple hours ago
/me gives Aurora a deep-fried twinkie
6I'm not starving, I'm just eating human-sized proportions and healthier food
6._.
6I never even liked those to begin with
12lol
12nor do i
12i heard deep-fried pickles are good
12Wooo
...
why do you deep-fry everything?
6LOL
6I've never figured that out
6I personally dont think deep fried pickles would be good either
6deep fried oreos also are low on the list
7ugh.
reminds me of the Simpsons joke "I can also deep-fry the bag if you want!"
mmmm......deep-fried.......
12Finally got my PS..
12Mabye i can actually start drawing good.

12I take critique and crap now, just not on that.
12I know it sucked.
12>_<

12I'm not ranting.
12Just warning.
7No. You're rantinh

6Pms don't work for me from here..>.<
6Wait,let me change.
12kk
12Hammle=hamster in my language.
What's the HTML code to make font smaller?
6There
6o.o
<font size="blah"></font>
I got that far
but I can't shrink the font
0.5 and 1/2 don't work
do you know what the size is right now?
char.... '~'
Uhmm... probably 1?
if it was 1 you wouldn't be able to see or read it
probably around 12
'normal' text is 12 pt
try putting it at 8
dude
o.o;; But 2 is default
you don't use decimals
6*sighs*
that's Aurora Borealis @ Umbreon
how the hell are you reading 2 pt font?
Maybe it's not 2 pt
copying and scaling up to a more readable size?
7http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/epic-fail-warning-win.jpg
XP
No
try including pt in the number
6Lol
6Well, it could be Aurora Borealis
6or Aurora Australis
6depending on where you're deep frying them
/me 6runs
I was messing with the code and happened to use s=2, and there was hardly any difference in size from the rest of te text
It'd be the southern lights in the south. There's no universal term
6Hai =D
2Yo.
6Ho are ya?
6*How
6-.-
2LOL.
wait, you've just got it as size=2?
hi Arti
2I am annoyed but otherwise alright.
6Horo, since when?
no ""'s?
7AAAAAAAH. *kicks Stacey off a cliff SPARTAAAAA-style*
6The keyboard being a biatch..-.-
6WTF
6both have technical names
6http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/weather/aurora.shtml
I've only ever heard of Aurora Australis referred to as the southern lights
6yeah
6that's what I was saying
then what are you saying is wrong with that I said?
6I thought you were correcting me for calling them Australis
6but apparently not, so I guess it's all good
howdy Arti :)
6oh hey it's the burd
/me grabs Aurora and Arti and gives both a big hug
12Hey

Mmm, cheese.
12lol
I finally found the perfect reason why Lugia is stronger than Ho-oh^^
6oh?
6because we all know it already, what's the new proof?
even if their powers are equal, Lugia would just use a very simple strategy:
2AMAZING!!
/me boils and dies.
6deflect your own attacks?
07Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeps
/me resurrects arrow
/me gives Arrow a 190 pound burger
12Water, looool
crush into Ho-oh, clinging close to it...and diving into the ocean with holding Ho-oh tight between the wings
/me grabs pills.
6truetrue
ohai Arti
/me places arrow on a perch
and everyone
6Lol
6of course, I'd rather not see the two fight, but that is true indeed
6hai
07Yeah
hello
Lugia can swim and dive...something Ho-oh can't. In fact, its feathers will soak and it would sink to the ground without a chance
07He'd just drag me underwater x_x
6I don't have to draw you underwater to drown you
/me 6RUNS
12hi
6not that I would though 3o
6o3o
/me 6wonders why she can't even half like Death Metal..
12o.I
07Hey XD
/me flies with sis
/me performs a vector roll.
/me watches arrow
/me then flies into aurora and gets lost in her floof
/me is gone forever o3o
7I could do better
07oops
12the burmuda Aurora
12*bermuda
6lol o-o
6Moltres?
07Yeah
12Grrrrrr.... Jess will not drop it >v> she asked me to drop it and I did right away but she's actually still carrying it on, now trying to split me and a friend up who were both hurt by Tier >v>
07What?!
12I just want to move on and forget Tier but she won't let me v_v
6Half like at least..-.-
07She didn't drop it yet?
2Mmmm, metal.
12No, she sent me a "warning" message about Bai
6I'm not really a Death Metal person..
6o_o
10hy
07What did she say...
...
12Just to stay away from her because she's psycho and some other stuff.. but anyway, who is Sphyng Bærd
12?
7Ok. So far I've got Cullen's body, a wall, and a LOT of blood
2http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Hv0tsvpyU Makes me chuckle.

7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMWi7CLoZ2Q
6Come to think of it I shouldn't even like Metallica then..or even LP really..
He's YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
?
2Metallica and Linkin Park are not death metal.
6They still are metal though
2Metallica are more thrash metal and I'm not quite sure what LP are seeing as I havent listened to them for ages and they have since warped genre, as it were XD
7No. looks stupid
6They're nu metal and stuff

12C7 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise
12Tell what what was?
7the image you're drawing, which appears to have a horribly case of pink eye
12Her eye color is pink.
7I see. is she the steed of Ms. Mary-Sue Perfect?/
6Thnx
6o.o
7or is it some kind of dog?
12No.
12It's a wolf.
7... what a surprise
12It's in the dog family/
7Lol, I found this quote:
7'Evolution is impossible: it violates the second law of thermodynamics! UNLESS there is a giant outside source of energy supplying the Earth with huge amounts of energy. If there were such a source, scientists would certainly know about it.'
12*draw it.
/me points at the SUN.
7drawing it well, I think would be appropriate
Humongous source of energy, and scienttists know about it.
Logic: 1, Idiots: 0
7Ah.
7@ Lugia
7You're in the south? o3o
lol... I thought everyone knew XD
12WOW.
12http://lysol.com/

7Oh.
7Okay.
10bbl by
12Mist - Sure does : http://everything.com/
12me: -.-
12well idk what to draw next.
just checking, the second law of thermodynamics is the one about closed systems with constant energy, yes?
12So why don't you make up an idea? O:
7something good. I think you should work on making your wolves, less horse-like.
12How?
12Which part looks so horse-like about them?
12*part(s)
7The entire god-damned head
6...
Or not, though it's still about closed systems
/me notes that Earth is not a closed system
7I found it through TV tropes, under Critical Research Failure.
ahh yes TVTropes
some good laughs in the lack-of-research based articles there
I LOVE TVTROPES
12Shh
12The silence is speaking
*cough* sun *cough*
7X3
7As I said. The whole head is horse-like
12Yeah,I'm speaking
12Lol.
12Who is that?
7Yeah, you'd get banned for this C7
I have no clue
12Meh.Just 5 seconds.. :P

6Lol yeah..:P
6God,I've never done more talking on msn that I did today..
7I ended up having Â£10 on my phone for six months, and then used it all in a day because I found out a couple friend's numbers

12Its not a good drawing.
Forum had some serious downtime...
12I know I know.
12Just example of the head shape..
no downtime
just a linking error
7No. Leave retardomon in the ditched pokemon pile where he belongs
oh, okay
/me points at the topic
12what?
6o.o
12?
12Was that too me?
/me 7blinks
7Woah, did my avatar just disappear? O_o
it did
so did mine
"Home" tab @ top of forum screen doesn't link correctly
/me 7fixes that
I know Andy
My avi is still there...
7Yes. That was tooooo (my point with this is you used the wrong 'to') you.
looks like our host messed up something about the webserver
should be resolved with the next graceful restart
7:|
7I can't fix my avatar.
neither can I
6...
just wait for the server to operate correctly. Bet you'll get over having no avatar for 24 hours, right?^^
So the "/forum/" link will work in the near future?
12wa that to my wolf head?
12*was
7Yes. Seriously. I've never met someone like you. Do you want me to cut 'YES IT WAS TO YOU' in a hammer and then pound your face with it?
I think it'll be working tomorrow again. If not, I'll be personally ripping the host's lungs out and play a song on them
I'd love to see that.
7o_o
yeah, I bet
12I dont know if it was for me or my WOLF drawing.
12-.-
Since the host had a huge screw-up last month, too
6Pff..too true..-.- (nothing to do with here)
I know
7I was talking ABOUT the wolf head, you stupid person
12http://i33.tinypic.com/27xe0rp.jpg

6Not at you
6Generally

6I'm trying to remember something
04how is everyone?
12...we've all wanted PS all of our lifes...and...none...of..us really cared if....it was um stolen.. but.... ugh fine.
6And I can't
12not all of us
12but a ton of artists
and you think I paid $600 for it?
No, but its sort of unspoken
12: P
12Okay.
you dont tell people how to get it. If they can't figure it out, they shouldn't.
12Sorry.
btw the portable version sucks.
7Or have siblings who can do it for them. My bro's awesome sometimes.
It crashes all the time and the fonts are messed up.
6Ugh..WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER IT?
7he's an asshole every other time though
and doesnt include plugins
7C7: repressed memory?
12Well than, what version do you have?
Im waiting for CS5, its going to have a new plugin for image retouching.
12then you have cs4.
6It's just two words I'm trying to remember and they won't come to me..D:
good, but tired
12...right?
and you're three days late
04?
CS4 Extended
But the portable version is different
7I'll wait until CS42 is released
it was hacked together and its crap
6O_O
04what?
today is November 3rd, not October 31st
you need a full install.
otherwise its no good.
04oh
I hate how cs4 has those dumb tabs
most annoying thing ever.

I wanna know everything about that bastard
1206/10/2009 13:43:23 (nnh) [c=3][b]Bai[/b][/c] Tier What happened between you and arti in the end?
1206/10/2009 13:48:24 Tier (nnh) [c=3][b]Bai[/b][/c] Well, basically, this Xai chap came along, he had more money than sense and managed to buy her love. We were up visiting him, he managed to woo her off her feet, and then she told me she had no feelings for me other than as a friend and never had.

That is true...
12i know an activation key though.
12;]
wont work.
12how do you know?
12o_O

/me should draw a swinub and tag it 'Lugia'! =D
/me hides
/me will add "Kitfox" to his future nutrition
See ? the one I've done for my first nickname wasn't that good...He was funny still.
preferably deep-fried
Altogether, Mr Dore has 114 children and grandchildren. His oldest son is 80 years old and three of his wives have died. < whaaaaaaaaaaaaat

http://img8.xooimage.com/files/3/1/7/av-2481-ebb2ce.jpg Laugh , it was my first try on PhotoFilter !
Huh ? I didn't use balises...
I should start adding some racist insults to those using fake-tags. Just to make them learn to tag right
12How about no?
I've mixed Doctor Mario and Snake from Metal Gear.
/me starts to heat the oil up
I kept this one on the parody website I am though :)
...Well , I've killed you all , how bad I am.
03LOL at racist insults on fake tags
03I love that idea
03but I had an idea too
03I'd make a bunch of viruses and really nasty stuff, make them the same size and filename as copyrighted mp3s
ugh computer talk is like the quickiest way to bore me lol
07lol how mean
03then give an "anonymous tip" to the RIAA
04Hey
03With my IP
03let them search it
04Hey Kyu

04Can you give me that link to the forums?
03and bam, there goes the RIAA's computers

I see always 7 users or so always connected , they have permanent connection to the chat ?
They just leave their computers on
I used to do that
@Altair: Well, if you only drink one or two glasses from time to time, it's quite healthy. Even the positive effects of wine are proven if you keep it in low numbers
...Wow , it must be very consuming about electricity.
7then you realised how sad and UNECONOMIC IT WAS. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BLAHDFBGIHEBFIGBWTIBWEIPFGBTIGBITGBWRITHBTIPPIWRETJGBWERIPGBRPWITHPPRSTBRPTR APPLE!!!

Pie > Cake
I can speak of my brother's broken PSP or our crashed Wii...Our console are all in a pretty bad state.
Cake = Fake
Pie = Lie
Truth = the youth
I say broken , but it work anyways.
DOWN WITH THE MAN!
LMAO!
2If(!Cake == truth) { cake > pie; } else { Pie > Cake; } ???
which man? and what man? and who man? when man? why man?
Home button problems with one game , the game freeze completely sometimes , so reboot necessary , but it works.
lmao
wtf man?
/me noms on an ear
/me is safe
/me earwigglies
my wii's graphics card is fried >_<
/me noms more on his own ear
...I wonder what it does with a game.
o.o;
found out when i 1st play spyro The Eterna Night whend it had some irritating lines
lmao wtf
Mine has fallen only 2 times , so no big problems... When , sometimes it freeze completely , but rarely.
makes games blurry, faint lines, and some screwed up scenery like the clouds etc
Oh well , your garphic card is completely crashed , so it can't do good things...
graphic*
mine has only frozen twice while playing games except dotd dragon when froze well over a dozen times
brb
I can still play the games but yeah its anoying and i found out RIGHT after it went out of warranty >_<
/me is getting strange results with the code he is trying to write. "Some parts of it is working, other parts are not!
The ventilator does a louder noise than others Wii , along with my frined's sayings.
/me pokes anyone who might know Java
you're not very lucky , huh.
My wii gets hot fairly fast depends on the game though
well atleast it still works......
Maybe it's the SSBB effect who does this ?
are there any good new wii games out
someone people just got the black screen of death from it
It's a double-written disc , to store twice more data , so problems can be found with this one...
naw wasn't from ssbb and i havnt really played that game much this year
oh you mean disk read errors? I got my wii 1 month after i bought ssbb never had a disk read error
!lag
SR : Maybe New Super Mario Bros. on Wii , it's 4 players this time.
Lol, 4 player Super Mario Bros?
How does that work?
7That's crazy
yep 1st multiplayer sidescrolling mario game on a console
Or Mario and Sonic , but minigames like we've seen so much on the Wii...
4 people play on the same level at a time thats how
7It's like putting Yoshi in the DS version of Super Mario 64 DS. WHO THE HELL IS ON THE ROOF?
-_-
7Actually. It's like editing anything from super mario 64 /ever/. That game was perfect.
Exact , I'll try to find a video for you.
/me spins
I'm getting it as soon as it comes out
/me spins some more
/me keeps spinning
/me spiiiiiiiiiiiiins~
/me trips and rolls forward four times.

New Super Mario Bros. Wii disk game for wii
Oh , and the new Zelda is coming , later , it will need the Wii Motion Plus.
yeah I know
That actually looks pretty cool
The last one was cool , but not OoT as the main author said himself.
6gtg
zelda .... don't like the series
6Bai peoples
Heya
Damn tanks on that game D:
mario kart is still my favorite wii game
2Boomer + tanks are worst, x_x
Boomers are easy to deal with
7hells yeah
I'd recommend not letting the world get over-run by zombies if you don't want to deal with tanks.
7mario kart is win
I used to be addicted to Mario Kart DS
Kipi the Tank I'm talking about is a very muscular zombie
lmao
I know
I prefer Crash Team Racing now though
haha!
I'm going to see if my brother will let me take the Playstation back to college with me next time I go home
love mario kart clocked like 400 Hours atleastinto the wii version My alltime favorite series
Huh sorry , I can disconnect sometimes like this for a little time.
I'm not bothered about that XD
Also I haven't tried versus yet
So don't let the world be over-run with zombies and there won't be super zombies. Problem solved!
/me flees
although the wii 1 just isn't very competitive though I rarely get to play with others though
lmao fleeing flee!
The MKWii is a good one.
2You should, :), you can play as the special infected. And Kipi, Ceda tried that but failed, xD
7The original Crash Team Racing for the PS1 was amazing
hi nite
12lol I have pics of Tier visiting other girl behind Jess's back.. with glorious exif data that contains exact dates and times..
o hai Arti
Even me who has played the epic MK on SNES thinks that.
xD
07lol
I know
4o.O
Ecco, you mean you can play as a Tank!?
12Should she continue to try and upset me I will show them to her.
Right , and you know what ? I onw it now.
yep although i havn't played it in like a month... mostly been burning out my ps2
I've had that game for probably 10 years now and it still never gets old
7On the sewer level if you're in the lead and one of the lightning balls is behind you, get up on the sides at the last possible moment and it'll miss
Who is Ceda?
Crash Team Racing and his sequel , who was less cool.
lol gotta love the electris thwomps on rainbow road in super mario kart
You really need to update the Downloads, Arti xD
electric*
Haha really?
7yeah
I suck at that track though
I can never get the shortcut >.>
7It was my favouritest level ever. I knew all the shortcuts
7I played dingo.
lol
oh really how about donut plains 3?
S.T.A.R.S.
Arti is an Arti.
7it's annoying that they just cut dingo out of crash games
>_< that level was torture on 150cc
k
I haven't played any recent Crash games
Or B.S.S, I think
I always play Coco though
7Oh yeah. What console is your ANB on?
I agree , Donut Plain 3...But what about cutting Dingo out of Crash recent games ?
Or some of the unlockable ones
I don't have ANB anymore
S.T.A.R.S. was from Area 51 in the arcade.
Me and DDR sold it to gamestop :D
...or was that S.T.A.R.R.?
I don't play the recent ones , but Dingo was in each of them...
gamestop...........
of the older ones I mean.
7what version DID you have?
LOL
PS2
hehe who wants to see my wii game collection
S.T.A.R.S from Resident Evil XD
I've played all the 3 ones in PS1 , but I own only the number 3 now.
S.T- yeah what Kipi said
http://imgur.com/1wM4C.jpg
Um-ber-ella?
12I put the newest Lugia trailer in it
Why?
Oh wait, Area 51 was STAAR XD
4abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
7ah. If you put the konami code into the gamecube ANB you got invincibility
/me 7blinks
7NS
B.S.A
ive got more but i didnt feel like pulling them all out of the sleves.
7*late*
+1 durr moment
XD
That's awesome
Gtg
bye
7I know. I only have the cbox version.
Cya
7I'mma try anyway next time I feel like it
7I fucking hate that train
my phone takes pretty good pictures eh>?
I wanted to smash the controller on that level
I remember making a thread about not being able to get past it
And Zekira replied and was like
4lmao abc
"What? People are having trouble with this?!"
>_>
4abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
7and I hate how they just took the train boss thing and strapped a new skin on it for TEN
4-_-
o.o
yes Quan?
Ugh, yeah
/me 7posted a new batch of notices in the KH thread and she sprited Xemnas as a cat with a heart. o3o
...Unhappily , I haven't played any of them.
wat
I don't see how so many people loved TEN
wat
wat
never played TEN or Dotd yet
I have them burnt though :)
7the entire plot of the game revolved around cynder having an angst-fit
Spyro in France isn't very known...take a look at the game stores...
7Wat.
Hah, yeah
I FEEL SO GUILTY ABOUT MY TRAGIC MARY SUE PAST I MUST RUN AWAY NOW AND YOU MUST SAVE ME
I can only find DotD , at least it's not nothing.
7oh yeah. In futurama, you know how they describe the french language as being useless and dead?
7In the french dub they had a hissy fit and made it german instead
Futurama ? I know the reputation of this website...
lets see i have Spyro ten/dotd, crash of he titans/mom super paper mario, mario galaxy, mario kart wii, ssbb, klonoa, wario land shake it, sonic and the secret rings, sonic unleahed, sonic and the black knight, dragonball z budokai tenkaichi 3, smackdown vs raw 2009, and metroid prime 3
I am 12 and what is this
eh, it's nice lol
i only like the difficulty in TEN
07u is odd
Have you fought Riku with Extreme yet, Quan?
07that's wat this is
it's damn hard D:
Wow , that could cost a LOT buying all these games...
I didn't even like that
7I could, actually.
I like difficult, but not frusterating and repetitive
try
7Naw.
Second Chance doesn't work at all
then you can't do it lol
i wait until most games are $20 or less except for my favorites
7Try using magic, NS. :3
/me runs
Yeah I know
but he blocks a lot
mainly mario
The only thing it was good for was pretending the monkeys were people you're angry at :)
7Have Elixirs.
and if he hits you twice then it's over
and magic takes too long to cast
I did that sometimes
Same for me , the new games are 50â‚¬ on the Wii , 70â‚¬ on the next-gen ones...
7Naw.
well i had a few other games but sold them
Seriously, try it, and tell me when you beat him lol
7BTW, that shockwave attack Riku does reminds me of Saix. o3o
7No, NS; it'd take too much time for even a single round.
I also beat Anti Riku with Extreme equiped :3
lolwhy?
7I can't do that. Like when people tell you just pretend the brick is someone you dislike. I just can't overlay imagination over reality.
7Try Believe's challenge.
eh that shockwave attack?
Believe's Challenge isn't that hard
Xion's battle mission thing is harder
http://www.playvee.com/
7Both of them?
7and you guys need to watch There Will Be Brawl on The Escapist. It's amazing
7The one where you can't miss with an attack once?
sonic riders zero gravity, dragonball z budokai tenkaichi 2, need for speed carbon, bust a move bash, boom blox, the craptastic wii play glad i sold it for more than i payed XD
4lmao
We weren't allowed to have any "real" games on wii
Because it was a "family game"
to be honest i don't really care about M rated games on wii
Lol me either
7http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/there-will-be-brawl
I'm talking about games like Mario Kart
Right...I've bought it only for two games and the virtual console , because I don't hack.
And Brawl
We weren't allowed to own them because they're too much like real video games
/me SQUEAKS
7... that's fucking stupid
I know >.>
.............sucks bigtime!
7I just realized I've never seen Xemnas's limit before. O.o
4-_-
4O.o
07lol
lolfail
I really only play one game. Me and my brothers play counterstrike 1.6 every night on lan.
4sum dead chat site lmao
It's not actually that hard, Quan
2 months and i have like 20 ps2 games cost less than super mario galaxy mario kart and smash bros combined
4jk!
I don't, but some kids in my neighborhood brought it over and wanted me to help them beat it :P
It was weird
7The two challenges I can't seem to get are the ones with the imposter.
Especially the soundtrack .__.
lol imposter
I play mostly at Brawl , but less now , this one is too slow and floaty for a fighting game...
I kept doing that one for Gear Component Ds
:3
7O.o
7Actually, mission 82 is better for that.
where do you get Shield Tech++?
mission 82?
the 6 heartless one?
7And you can get an oricalcum(sp), too.
I haven't played a console game in forever
i used to play brawl a lot to whoop my friend when he came over but havnt seen him since march so lost interest in it
lol I have so many Orichalcums it's unfunny
I think the last time I played one was when I went over to a friend's room and played Halo
I have about 50, sadly
7Meh, me too, but I keep them in case I have t'make any of the rings and stuffs.
7Ugh. Halo.
xD
well
I couldn't understand why it was rated mature <_<
I need one Shielf Tech ++
Shield*
7Mission 90.
7Invisible.
eh, I hate defeating Invisibles
About ma , it was to be a master at the sequel of one of my favorites games...I've lost interest and regain it a lot , but no longer for now.
lol
7Fine, mission 85.
it always gives me Gust Gems though D:
7NS, different missions give different rewards.
ahk
Halo...I've played a little at the 3 this afternoon...No fun this time , because my friends weren't here.
....it's no wonder I hate CGI:IRC
I didn't think it was that fun
-__

We played on Xbox Live
/me pokes back
I'm pretty bad at this one , always onwed by the rocket laucher or the big sword thing
And I'm pretty sure I was the only one who had no idea what I was doing
07how far ahead of the rest of the group are your characters, NS? o3o
07the rest can't see the fortress yet
Eh, not too far

IMMA CHARGIN' MAH LAZOR
/me 's lazor backfires
BLAAAARGH-GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
has anyone heard of the game: Action 52
XD
er no
Hah
UHM...I THINK
caps fail
i gtg
baiz pplz
it was for the NES without a seal of approval
and it was noted to be the worst games of all time
one of the worst games
07lol
52 action games in one cartridge
Action 52 isn't nearly as bad as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
/me cues the horde alert from Left 4 Dead.
7<random find> Someone! Try to slay the Ruler of the Sky with Lexaeus.ï»¿ :D </random find>
/me 7pokes NS randomly :3
lol Arrow
and it was priced in the US at 199 dollars.
(sorry phone)
/me gets strangled by a smoker while the horde distracts him
I like messing with the barricade builder in Survival
07lol Quan
07o3o
Back to the Future NES = storm of crud
2I've seen a youtube video where people built barricades before, rooftop of No Mercy yet never tried it myself.
2(before survival mode was implimented)
It's fun but only if you do it with other people
Because the bots are too dumb to follow you into your barricade
I want to build a fort which contains firing slits so you can crouch and shoot out of it =P
7KY
7KYU*
2that sounds fun Arrow
07wut
I already did that
It's not hard
7ORLY?
Just get homing glide
and win
and get Haste
/me 7pokes Dustflier. o3o
7BTW, what mode are you playing it on?
07now take down Dustflier with Mr. Bookslappy Guy
07o3o
7Lulz.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF1n1AxK1Dg I remember this commercial.
07oh gawd lol
07I won something like that in an arcade
07XP
"never buy an expensive cartridge again" *throws out an SNES cartridge* wow.
really? XD
07yeah lol
wtf
07it was actually pretty fun when you compare it to shooting yourself repeatedly in the foot
/me runs
I had more fun sitting on a chair filled with spikes on the seat and having a herd of elephants run me over as I sat
256 games in one handheld. 15 skill levels for each game with over 2000 ways to play! full function calculator built in. WOW! this this is garbage!
the games where not as good and only involve getting score I'd imagine
07yep
It's called a cheap attempt to get people away from the big name consoles. It fails worse than Paris Hilton at singing.
and a calculator built in. yeah my teacher would let me have that in class.
07the only one I found moderately fun was a shooter where you had to eliminate tetris blocks as they fell on you o3o
heehee ^_^;
07then again I was only 11 XD
x3
LOOOL
/me sits and plays tag with his tail
So why am I losing so badly at this game?
07and we all just lost.

LOLOLOLOL, what happened?
02went up to like 50000 - 100000 bytes XD
Hahahaha. XD
02And previously in period 1
02The Hensh was saying that if you had any tools like Kain and (something) like the pass cracker tools
02then you could be expelled from the school
02xD
O_o
/me shrugs
02D:
Imma set up a DOS attack with as many people as I can get on my school when it's my last day.

07Hellos
07Hi
12sup :D
07Not much. Just figured I'd chat on here while Im waiting for my vampire's energy to re-up
07Its actually a pretty lame game, but I figure why not be queen of the Lame-o's?! Lol
12lol
12i'm having fun with my brand new da account
07Dont know what that is
07Ahh.
12:)
07I dont have an account, but Cynder does
12i know
12:P
07xD
12i'm surprised it's not 90% hidan
07Lol. She seems to be "Bleach" crazy now
12lol really?
12i hardly see her anymore :(
07IDK if she has done any art though
07Thats because shes either on the DS or the Wii playing Bleach, Sonic, or one of the Pokemon
12lol
12reminds me of nick
/me listens to ozzy :3
07I told her Im going to teach her how to make a pair of pants on saturday. At least her DS will have a chance to charge! Lol
12lawl!
07Then again, she's usually so lazy that she will probably only end up making a pillow instead!
12i never thought of her as the lazy type o-O
07Well, thats because it sounds like shes been really busy when she says how far she has gotten in a game. But how do you suppose she gets so far? Hours of laying in my bed playing, only getting up for a snack! LAWL
12hey
12that sounds like me this week :D
12i have the flu
hai
07Aww. That sux

I think I fried the new piece of RAM I bought
O_O
dang
I think I will have to get it replaced
Say that the thing was dead on arrival or something
-_-;
Though I admit trying to install it. .sdrawkcaB
That may have fried it or something
but truth is,
no one knows
maybe it wasn't compatable for the motherboard?
The RAM I got was from Kingtston
and acording to the web site it should be the right one
I fried my USB SD card adapter -_-;
And I already have the same model of RAM in there
I pulled the SD card out when it was still plugged in. now it wont read the cards -_-;
will have to buy a new one
Ich
12are you at all very familiar with DA?
of course :)
12i'm messing with my new account
Somewhat here
12and i can't figure out how to add in the old block for your desktop screenshot
You can't
They stupidly disabled the ability to add more than one when you remove one of either two
12sigh
^^;
I should be sighing
I fried my RAM
*nods*
which does suck
Suck suck suck
I fried it months ago
I NEED 4GB OF RAM NAO.
O3O
wow
I'm on a 64-bit system
you have an autodesk program?
And yet I only have 2GB
No
oh
But I use The GIMP quite frequently
I see
I rather not use 64 bit ^_^;
12yeah it does
12hi sis
I use 64-bit so I can hold off buying a new computer for at least another 3-4 years from now
07whats the diff between 64 bit and 32?
Because 32-bit is fast being phased out
Memory space
rbrage laundry
07kk
really? O_O
and my laptop is still 32bit
12darnit
12here's another stupid question
12is there a button to navigate your way to your watch list?
12nevermind

'-'
12i've been messing with my new DA account and installing friends and such
12and i finally decided to do the irritating task of updating my list
.-.
wb
12i got to mention
12because of people like me
12keeping track of your friends on DA is annoying :D
2o.o
I wouldn't know
12ark

halloooo
sanwakinyan, the solution to that is don't
>.> <.<
Huh?
i have thousands of messages adsf
12heh
Oh, on dA!
I check mine daily
buuut
2o.o
I don't reply to comments until the weekend
Samui may or may not exist
My guess is no
i have like 300 people that i watch, so it's a biiit much to keep up with
and yeh, that can be difficult sometimes
especially when their DA name is vastly different from their normal name
12remember the story behind your sudowoodo account?
aside from it being amazing? nope, i don't remember the story
12we were randomly going through DA looking for what pokemon names were taking up for accounts
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes
i remember
12then you noticed no one took sudowoodo for an account name lol
that was like coming across a secret treasure. ^___________^
arroooooow

6yup
12hi
/me tackles Arti
07hihi
12hi
hai arti :3
12#hey
12She still wont stop you know
:\
who? O_O
12http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2989964
12Read all that below
12[11:59:26] * Now talking in #hey
6lol bree
^^;;
/me climbs up on articuno's wing and onto her back
6Arti, I have a question
6what will you do if Jess learns the truth about tier?
6and believes it herself
point and laugh
12Dunno.
12She's not exact being a very nice friend to me
12So she may end up causing me and Xai so much grief, she'll have no one to turn to
-_-;
6Yeah that's true, but you have to know that in her mind, Tier is the good guy still
/me is hungry
12If she was mature, she wouldn't take sides. She'd tell him to drop it and she'd drop it herself.
12She would continue as normal with me and Xai
12But she's actually causing us problems
12It's his bad influence.
btw I never knew you had an FA account :3
arti
12She's not exactly bright.. she'll just act like whoever she's with.
Wow. jess is such a jerk! =/
best to block her, arti
12>v>
12She was my best friend thanks.
-_-;
I see
It's not as simple as things look
6which is why we should see what time will bring
07Agreed
07Well god damn it
6unfortunate as it is
/me sighs
I'm sorry articuno
/me prods Jess mentally 46 times over with a quill
07I wish she'd indeed just dop it, I read that exchange and that was .. terrible o_O;;
12if you can't beat them, join them
12She also keeps messaging me on Facebook.
-_-
6:/ that is a bit extreme
12Actually yeh I am Umbreon, this is the third time I've asked now and she still hasnt stopped so Im gonna paste Tier logs to her until she does.
12sometimes it's best to pretend things are okay and wait for another chance to strike
07Why can't she just drop it i wonder?
/me sighs
6because of her situation
6while I admit dropping it would be best, I can see why she continues
this sucks.
6stupidly, but yes
07Mm
07Also asdf
07oyu might know me best like this
hi
/me sits under his changing table -.-
we are not having a good time right now -_-;
12Hi
theres really no need to ban my irc account
12No Im sorry
12I banned Tier
12and you have the same IP address
y doesnt that surprise me Â¬Â¬
12His own fault :3
x.x

12Dunno what they changed though!
6oh that's what happeed?
6+n
oh Arti guess what ive seen now
12What?
Pokemon Heroes
12Thats one of the best.
heh i didnt think i would like it so much ^^;
Latias is quite cute
12No one expects it but it really is one of the best they made
AHHH LEEEKSPIN ON MY TV
not only the forum died Arti
the beginner oekaki was also dead
12what now,,?
and so is your personal gallery
12Oh my personal gallery has been down since the "upgrade" :/
12You should see the length of the support ticket I opened for that
6I like Heroes, but at the same time not my favorite
yeah, and the beginner's oekaki was down with the same error like the forum
12It took them about 5 tries to restore JUST the table structure, then they said it was resolved.. but they didnt restore the data....
Power of one is still my fav
/me cuddles Jess for that statement
or "Revelation Lugia"
as you call it
6same

12Dunno
I've still only seen one movie.
And intend to keep it that way.
6I think I just like the third because the music is just beautiful
6in the 4kids one
4kids must die.

12He's not he just likes to offend people.

LOL

*weetabix
darn keyboard

I think I'll set up a dedicated Windows Server 2008 with Host Europe next year
03EW WINDOWS SERVER
Windows Server 2008
Full Administrative Rights
Dell PowerEdge R200 , R410 or R710
03Go with Linux, much better
up up 4 x Quad-Core Intel CPUs
up to 256 GB RAM
up to 6 x SAS 3,5" or 8 x SAS 2,5“ HDDs
03LOL at GB RAM though
sorry, but no, no Linux
03why not?
because it's a HELL OF WORK to administer and patch
Only 256 GB RAM?
enough for a server in fact
lol there's no ram of that amount xD
shouldn't 64-bit be able to take around 16 billion GB?
03why would you need that much RAM?
lol
wut
You wouldn't. But it should in theory be capable of that
why drf?
it's a myth they'd be unsafe in fact
the only servers being hacked on the web are really Linux machines or Windows machines with some crappy Serv-U ftp servers running on them
whilst a properly configured Windows Server is inpenetrateable
and I know HOW to make a Windows Server inpenetrateable
12Ok guys site's fixed..
12I wish I could find out why /forum doesn't work on Php5 but com_smf does..
/me kisses Arti
12O__________________________o
woah. lol
12T_T
ouch!
hey, that was a handkiss oO
/me hides
12Still ^^
well windows servers should be impenetrable given the amount you pay for them and how much paid, professional work has been put in
12No kissy the birdy
03LOL Articuno, so about that host you have
and you deserved it for your great work
/me runs
how about hugs?
12Hugs are fine
12I don't mind hand kisses really, I just didn't know where he'd kissed me LOL
/me hugs then
03<usotsuki> besides, any Windows machine is horribly insecure unless you firewall it off
03<usotsuki> preferably a Linux machine, in which case why not go Linux all the way?
03Our school had a Windows server, and my friends and I hacked it like 10 times
03and we're not even that good at that sort of thing
12Why are you pasting that?
12lol
03because I can?
oh and btw. Arti: http://www.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/server-poweredge-r710/pd.aspx?refid=server-poweredge-r710&s=biz&cs=555
12We know Windows makes a crappy server, who cares? XD
THIS would be our server
12Sweeet
12One day..
03LOL, overkill ftw?
well, if I get the position I want, I'll gladly pay the 90 euros per month for it
07Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
rawr
07FINALLY AFTER FIVE YEARS I IDENTIFY A WEIRD MIDI FILE

I think they are
12Hey
Hiya Lugia :>
Heya all ^^'
Also yay for Bon Jovi's new album :)
07Hey Lugia
I tried a few FF games. I'm at least semi-obsessed with not having uncompleted games yet I can't be bothered to complete any of them
07Why not?
I've completed every FF game i've played
07Any good?
07I might have to be forced through FF7...
I just don't find them fun or interesting
07I loved Advent Children but I'm somewhat tired of being told off for not knowing how awesome Sepiroth and Cloud are as characters
07Like how they're structured
lol
XII is particularly bad. I was just about ready to give up on it entirely, then the memory card borked and gave me an excuse
07>.o so I'm considering letting Arrow have his goddamn way and be done with it
07LOL Horo that works too
I like FF12
I COULD replay it from the start, but I'm not gonna
I actually liked the beginning (somewhat), but the later parts and vast amount of grind put me off entirely
OMFG Arti, Genesis has 35 albums Ovo
I just can't understand why the wireless cards will not install on any of my computers, but it installs fine on my dad's computer >>
1235? Are you sure?
12i thought it was 10
According to the discography on mininova yeah
12*17 even
12I have 17 of them
Wait what genre is Genesis?
12I wonder if it includes all the "best of" albums..
12I don't really know. Rockish stuff
Then yeah 35
12There aren't 35 I checked the page myself XD
Over 4GB of music in the discography
07LOL
07Eeeeeeeeek
12Thats including Phil Collins on his own I think.
07I found a weird creepy german version of what sounds like barbie girl........................
07X_____x
link?
12It also includes all the live music and specials
07Lemme see if I can find it uploaded somewhere
12I'm sure there are only 17 albums
Not sure XD
03my friend has it
03it's actually legit
12I have all their albums :>
07Actually

Hullo

Thanks to you I thought RN's mate was a FEMALE >.>
07It's so difficult, just like 'bluejay'
07WHAT LOL
07HOW DID YOU DO THAT
07I NEVER SAID HE WAS FEMALE LOL
Because you only used his last name!!
07And his last name is feminine how? oO
07I thought I was supposed to be polite
07and when you do that you sue last names
07*use
It sounded like "Bernette" or something, geez!
07Loooooooooooooool oops
With you I'm never sure @_@
lol bernette
No one :o
07ANYWAY
07Arrow i think you're fleeb

12Black?
07Fiiish
07Okies
feash
07Arrow - I fail twice
07your colour perception's better than mine
Fail squared?
I told you she looks a little Gothic!!
12What colour did you think it was?
it's possible to be colour blind for black?
12>v>
12I do not..
Er
Nevermind
I didn't say anything
12It's just a damn black shirt! XD
07LOL that picture particularly you might, just a bit
07but in your other pics
07No
04LOL
07But Articuno, I thought it was dark blue/navy
12I don't look the slightest bit gothic in that pic >v>
oh Arti?
12It looks a bit like that because of the lighting :>
12yes?
/me votes that the picture be retaken then. =P
I think I'll give you a call before I takeoff. My mobile provider FINALLY lowered the rates
12Ok ^^
from 1.83 euro/minute for everything within the EU to 12 cents/minute
12Haha nice
yeah, that's kinda a discount^^
07^-^
/me huggles back
maybe because almost NOBODY was calling outside germany because of them...
04Hehe, black shirt = gothic :B
04I'M WEARING CAMO, I MUST BE ARMY GUY
It's more than just that, it's mainly the pose and the hair colour too
04I'm such an ass XD
She looks far less gothic in practically every other photo I've seen
Hell I guess I should be wearing a flight suit of some kind.
07Camo is sexy o.o
o.O
07that's just my opinion though
07sdgjkhsdfg

That, perhaps, is one of the girliest things I've heard you say.
07LOL

12<Challenging player (Name not revealed)>
6I'm amazed she didn't hit me lol
12<game start in 10 seconds>

6the one who left comes back and asks the group questions to find out what ailment they have
2lolwhut
12ya what?
6I was in the group when we decided we were going to have turrets syndrome
12I have Turrets
6the "psychiatrist" asked me "what's your favorite hobby?", and my reply was "I like to PICKLES draw and read PICKLES and hang out PICKLES with my friends PICKLES."
12XD
6so, that's always been an inside joke, because none of us could stop laughing
12OMG

12hmm?
12http://images.spaces.covers.com/Upload/UserImages/Rick_Roll.jpg what to see a very cool pic?
12@365
7 2: I can't get that last mission in Olympus Coliseum. D:
12I see "Rick Roll" in it =P
12XD
12D: @Quan
12dang!!!
7 3: When battling Anti-Saix with Saix, they both just so happened to go berserk at the same time. o3o
12you mean the Fire Spinning Ball, Quan?
12lol
7No.
12XD
7The 'avoid taking damage' one.
12last Mission...
12OH
12gawd x-x
12I need 1 more Sigil for that one...
12XD
6Kyu
7Ditto. :/
7I got the Scorching Sphere.
6this chapter totally had me lost for a minute
07arf
7Spam Blizzara.
6it's the one where they parody high school
12lol
12I used Blizzard only o-o
12Blizzara I can't use x-x
7Blizzara > Blizzard.
7Why?
07lol
12I don't know...
12lol
12attack spells in that game are all different IMO
6this is a REALLY weird chapter
7Dangnabbit.
6but amusing at the same time
7WORK, L KEY, WORK. D:
12I mean the fire category, Blizzard, etc
12XD
12and I can only use Fire, Aero, Thundaga, and Blizzard properly
6Aero?
6speaking of the dragon
6where is she :|
Oh
I was about to be like
"she's not on! D:< "
07call her now
07o3o

6delay dinner
12lol Aurora(late)
6for 10 seconds
7I hate those 'avoid taking damage' missions, I repeat.
6call her
6O3O
12agreed, Quan x-x
7Take on those six giant heartless with only 5 hits between them. O_o
7The Stalwart Blade's easy with Aero.
12I know! x-x;
12it is? o.o
7I used Thundaga for the Lurk Lizard.
it went to message. =O
now brb, dinner
XD
7The Orcus, though, is annoying. D:
12I thought it absorbed ALL attack magic (Stalwart)
07do you have circle block on for the orcus?
7Well, yeah.
03BANJO
7But when it uses those two attacks, it's easy to get hit.
12yah x-x;
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2onSzVpYhx0&feature=related
7And the Powered Armor...
12Gawd x-x

07You can have two channels open...
/me noms the scrambled eggs she just made
6Oh wait no

/me floofs sky-pillow
10Nuu
6"-.- I need BB to give me FFIX"
10Skypillow is hungry!

5I lost that file and my ePSXe forever ago.
/me sits on teh pillow
5In like July.
2ty Skylands
5I'm playing a new copy I goto n the ps2.
10Don't mention it
10:3
6:O
pillow nuu talk D:
6I wish I could get ePSXe..-.-
5Dad ordered it for me, cause I bugged him into it. He SAID he could get ianything I wanted..kekeke.
5Why can't joo?
/me sits in Flame "Now you're my pillow!" :O
/me is a magical pillow

OM nom nooooom Owo
04How can a pillow eat its master :O
yuuuu not meh master D:<
Spawky is!
6But my mom's scared that it might cause a problem to the computer and my dad would go nuts if the computer got ruined so yeah..
04I'm your Pillow Master =.='
5It didn't do nothin' to mine. The most it can do is freeze up and need to be closed with the task manager, as long as you get the right game torrent.
/me melts into the ground
5And I can find it again and link you to it
5If you want the FFIX one
6My mom just won't let me whatever I say..D':
5Darn.
6I've been wondering though,do you like play with the actual controllers and stuff?
04Ahh. I wanted to drink Flame D:
6Or do you use the keyboard?
O_o
5You can set up a keyboard to act as everything but the analog sticks, or you can look for an adapter for the controllers
ok!
6:O
/me throws napalm at u
thar u go
04O.o;
5The way I had mine set up:
5Keyboard --
6So you just move the char with the arrows and stuff?
6*sighs*
6I just wanna play my old Spyro's..D:
5W: up A: left S: down D: right SPACE: x RSHIFT: o F: triangle UPARROW: square [ ] : R2 / L2 Q / E : R1 / L1
5But you can use any keys you want just about
6:O
5My lalyout was just the easiest one I could figure out
5layout*
5It's a good setup for beginners who like using both hands
5And easy to remember controls
6Cool
5I like using the space for X because it's a habit of mine to use it for jumping or confirming things in games anyways
/me eats PS
5The setup was specifically made when I was playing Spyro the Dragon on ePSXe but it can be used for any game.
6I've told my mom that it's like the best emulator and stuff and that almost everyone uses it but she won't let me whatever..D:
5It doesn't matter how you set it up for whatever game
6Yeah
5Well
5tell her
/me noms on Flame's spleen
5I said, "It's the best thing for people who wanna save money instead of buying ps1 games, plus it can
04Guest?
5't do more than freeze or error out. Your computer'd be safe."
04oh, lol
6Ok
Nope. Just good ol' me.
Guest!
xD
10Skyyy!
jk
looool
5And if she doesn't trust me, she can shuddup about it I:<
Hey Skylands. :o
D:
10Wassup? :D
/me steals Skyland's Lugia plushie and gives her his Lucario one
That's wassup
:D
/me floofs sky-pillow
!plushie
/me clings to her Lucario plushie
xD
XD
5I really don't like it when moms go all overdrive to the point they don't trust their kid(s)' friends, and even, like in my case, their kid(s).
6I've been wanting to play the Spyro's for years and stuff..The only choices there so I can play them is to either go to the USA or Canada,get an adaptor or get ePSXe.
Hopefully I can do it again.
Last year's was quite fun.
6Yeah..
5My mom doesn't trust me since I was chatting when I wasn't supposed to And cursing a bit in '07 on flyff
5I WAS NINE YEARS OLD
5I had no friends IRL
And when my dad asked where'd they all go, I had fun explaining why I sent cards to California, Arizona, England, and other places
6She's just scared of getting it cause she's not fimilliar with it or something..-.-
10I wish I could, but my parents are strict about giving out confidental info.
6D:
5except one kid who used me for a personal game-arcade-thing
07heh

07It was my idea the first time around so Im kinda proud of myself x3;;
LOL

/me quacks all over Kyu

07ohai
07o3o
5My mom kept pestering me whether I wanna live with her or dad again and again and I blurted out "NEVER"
5after a while I started saying I didn't mean it..
5NEITHER*
Signed up o_o
/me catches it in a Pokeball
5not never.
5I can't type today.
5Anyways
6D:
/me throws the Pokeball away
/me breaks free
5Sometimes I do mean it...
/me still got caught though...
-_-
/me randomly blasts really funky jazz music in someone's ears
5Now usually when she says I'm acting immature I just laugh. Because, usually when that happens, she's acting less mature than me at the time.
04I hate Jazz Dx
/me is blasted
5The laugh's mostly inwards, because if it's too loud I get tons of annoying idle threats spat out at me >>
it's true... Poke Balls ARE like prisons...
5"I'LL TAKE AWAY SO AND SO" "I'LL DO THIS OR THAT"
10Jazz and Oprah suck

5A. Save money for bus or plane tickets, stop by friend's house, move back, but different county.
5B. Save money, wait till I get a car, say I'm going on a road trip; run away.
*fangirling*
5C. Travel 500 miles on foot and live as a hobo...
5D. Wait until she comes to find _me_
6Hmm
6I think A seems better..
07keeled it.
5Which plan should I go with?
5A and B are expensive, C would take years...D is gonna drive me nuts..
5I really wanna go with A.
5There's about 7 (and then some) anime conventions in Texas, mostly around Dallas
5And if mom's BF moves down we'll be there, then I could just use D
TTATT
lol
I open facebook to see if someone responded to something
5Or E. Combination of A and D somewhat. Choose a meeting place near or on the state lines. feign a road trip and get an apartment in mesquite/somewhere near but slightly away from dallas.
and I find they did

6Shame aeroplane tickets cost so much..-.-
5Yeah

5I dun't wanna go to MA...it's too far from my friends and my sister..
5She doesn't realise that if we go she's taking me away from so much...
6Yeah..
6And you'll have to start over..
5I know she wants to get away from My dad/Scott, but I don't care, I want to stay with my sister
5I have nothing to start over on. No IRL friends 'cept my sister...And my mom who THINKS she's one

07you saw nothing.
07>.-.>
07<.-.<
5I'll have to go to public school
5Well, almost the worst part
5not really
5but
O:
5Still bad'
6Well maybe you'll make some good friends there..
5I don't want to GO there
5;n;
6D:
5Hopefully we aren't
6I hope you don't
/me curls on top of Aero
What kind of school do you go to now?
7everyone above the age of 10 has been bullied
5Back, sorreh, went AFK without "brb"ing. And, I'm homeschooled.
silence
7what's your problem with public schooling BB?
5For one, I have problems sleeping at night and don't wake up in mornings as it is with an alarm clock, two, I'm under enough stress as it is, and three, I'm not done with speech therapy yet (Plus I write in freaking chickenpoop. Not chicken scratch. Chicken POOP.)
7handwriting ability is NOT a reason.
2I kill you!
07keel
07o3o
5What kind of grades do you think I'd get with answers looking like "adfjklsdngdfjk3weitfrn44w3jrmnjk"? .__.
!slap The Game
/me slaps The Game with 5 poker decks
7No, I mean just because you can't be bothered to improve it is one of the worst reasons for not going to actual school ever.
you can't slap the game
you can only lose it D:
5I can think up at least another two reasons if just that. >_<
07good job Altair D=<
thanks! ^^
7being a heavy sleeper is not a reason either, and what stress, exactly? I believe if you're not at least in year 10 you don't get to bitch about stress and be spr srs.
well you just did
(usted acaba de perder el juego!)
(late)
stop making me lose The Game in Spanish
07stop translating so that I lose The Game in English
07D=
5Not everyone is stress free as a child. Trust me, I've got too much to name it. For a few things, My mom and dad are going through divorce, I've been worried about just how much my mom will criticize me next time we w alk around the corner, and all the other crap I'm going through. And trust me, usually if I sleep at all, even from 9 pm, it's
5until almost noon.
5She* not we
/me lost the game
5Plus I'm crap at socializing in public.
5My speech problems don't help this.
it's Altairs fault!
he put it there to translate
/me catches
yes it's my fault
there are a million ways to lose
... like the one I just used.
07nooo
/me strangles Altair and shakes him around!
07you made me lose!
07gah! it happened again!
:D
/me clings to Altair's neck
7Your parents are going through a divorce? Wow. You must be the first child to have that problem ever. You have criticisive parents? So do I! And all teenagers have ridiculously long natural sleep times, the average being 10-12 hours. Mine is longer than most, but seriously, it takes VERY little willpower to just be ready in time.
/me falls in the lake :o
7Socializing problems. Yeah, ostricising yourself from everyone your own age REALLY helps with that.
/me dives in to try to break it up
6Gawd
lol
05hi everyone :D
05hi kyu
oops x-x
5Back. And, good grief, do you have to find any and every way to be right? You sound just like my father..
/me dies
5><
/me dives down to look for Max's body
6Why does the phone have to not work when I need it?
5And I'm sick of taking that shit from people.
/me steals Aero's kimchi!
5Thanks, I knew something was stinking up the yard.
7If you're tired of taking shit, then stop painting a massive target on yourself.
5How am I doing so? Please elaborate on how I'm SUCH a nice little target practice spot.
5Because I really didn't ask for your bull crap.
7You keep listing things that have happened to either 1/3 of people or 99% as if they were specially deisgned to get YOU down.
5I'm not saying they were, I know they stress other people. Don't you think it'd be nice for once to consider that you're not the best person on earth?
5And that doesn't mean I am either, so don't go throwing that at me.
Hey guys
05hi
5I realize I'm no better than the average kid, so sue me if I complain a bit. Doesn't mean you're helping.
07rawr

Hello~
http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/866/lugiabot1.jpg
7You're putting these problems out as if they're anyone's fault but your own, when they're mostly things that could be fixed with just a little bit of willpower and intelligence.
07lol I remember seeing that
Oh lol xD
I posted the whole conversation in the LugiaBot topic
05O_o
5Back, sorry, my sis needed something.
5And, don't you think I've TRIED finding a way past it? I really don't give a rat's ass if you think you know how to live my life. It's my own to live, thanks for wasting that
5last fiew minutes.
5*few
I need to think of more ideas on how to talk to him.
The Ugandan woman scam went hilariously

Extreme sports are the only things that stop life from being dull.
BEEEEP BEEEP OUTTA MY WAY!! GO BACK TO JERSEY!!!! WEE-OOOH-WEEE-OOOH
the sounds of New York
5That, and..a giant pie the size of the US.
5That would be epically random.
5>> <<
7On this note. Golf, table tennis, motor sport and another one I forget.
5-went into random mode-
7are not sports.
6Why,the day that my friend'll finally go online againa and I would be able to do an effing videocall with her I have to get kicked off?
7and seriously. No matter how people want to wish it, 95% of skateboarding is NOT extreme
5LOL true
5It's just sliding around on a board with wheels and hurting yourself.
6Well,at least that's over with
7and motor sport. People are like 'you have to be fit to do it!!!!111apple' and I'm just 'Yes, but it's not EXERCISE, stupid twifags.'
It was where I went with my friend, you try dropping in off a 12ft half-pipe.
/me yawns
5Lmfao true
5...Zomg random apple
/me 5steals the apple and runs.
7if anything, professional 2 ton pie-eating is more extreme than skateboarding
7The apple is a twitard joke
5Exactly o_i
5o_o*
...
Again, you try dropping in off a 12 ft half-pipe.
Because TBH, I doubt you have the balls.
7It's completely unnecessary and has no reason for being there.
7Dari: no. That's not extreme, that's stupid.
7That's like saying russian roulette is extreme
Lol, look up extreme?
6Why do people go out so effing often..-.-
"Sports: Very dangerous or difficult"
7The dictionary meaning is not what it actually means. Learn the difference between extreme and stupid.
7Russian roulette is dangerous. still not extreme.
Just because you want the word to mean what you like to think it means, doesn't make it so.
Russian roulette isn't a sport.
6And I'm like seriously the only person that doesn't go out like at least 15 times a month
7I could say the same to you.
I have dictionaries on my side.
Lol.
yo
AERO
hi
6Ugh
7I have common sense and logic on my side.
5Wow, ink on paper
7The vulcans win I'm afraid
/me dies
6Hopefully she didn't see I was online
/me 5slams her head into the keyboard.
/me must go over there to have a cheezburger
6Hooray for the option of blocking people
14hmmm...is mountian boarding consittiered a sport?
Anyway, playing russian roulette can be considered extreme. Risking your life is an extreme choice to make.
Common sense isn't on your side.
7Again. Extreme. Learn the meaning of this. Stupid.
5No, it's just stupid, because you can be killed. It's called being smart enough not to do it.
Just because an extreme sport is stupid, doesn't mean it's not extreme.
7No, you don't.
7Not once have I ever seen you do that
If someone has explicitly proved that something I've said is wrong, I'll acknowledge that.
And how often have I been on here recently?
7Ah. There you go. You'll only admit you're wrong if there's undeniable evidence, and no-one can be bothered to do that
LOL, now that's just a stupid thing to say. If I have an opinion on something, then I can't be wrong, it's my own personal opinion.
5I've never seen anyone admit they're wrong, unless slapped with a brick and having proof against their theory or idea shoved in their eye sockets
If it's something factual, then if someone proves that I'm wrong, fine.
roar
7Congrats, you're using /Twitard/ logic.
5People never admit they're wrong, at least much, because everyone's afraid of being wrong. I'm really getting tired of arguments. Of course, human instinct requires us to come out on top. So, well.
Using silly made up words still doesn't make you right.
I'm loved by someone! yay!
/me 7asplodes
ello
7BAH.
boo?
im lost
5Alright then, let me lengthen that out so you can read it. "Twilight fans that are retards".
7Way to completely side-step what I said. Next you'll be telling me THAT'S an extreme sport.
Side-step what?
5Need me to spell it again? >>
5Jeeze, now everyone's confusing me.
5I don't even know what started our argument...
7What I said. It's a text based conversation. Repetition of something recorded two centimeters up is not necessary
05why
What you isn't something I can reply to.
I'm using "Twitard" logic, I don't know what that is.
for resons that deny my imagination
/me 5now remembers why she doesn't come online on SF/SC much anymore.
6Now I'm confuzzled too
This is the first time I've been on in a while.
5Same here.
Excuse me?
6This is the first time I see it SO alive for months now
You expect me to know what your made-up words mean?
7You're excused.
Why would I?
/me 5doesn't even remember when she came on last
/me hops onto Lugia's head
7Common fucking sense. Seriously. A six year old could figure it out. As you said, you have the dictionaries on your side.
/me hands Kyu a cookie ^v^]
Twitard isn't in any dictionary.
/me dances
*-]
05hi Lugia
ohaifjdlkasl;kfasjd
6FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
7No, but you could use one to figure it out.
Heya ;>
7Common sense and a bit of intelligence.
7which is obviously a bit more than you have.
6Now she's telling me off for even asking for ePSXe again..
6D<
5Do you need me to define it again? "Twitard: A long-time or big fan of the (incredibly stupid anyways) Twilight series."
How does a dictionary help me work out what YOUR word means? It's Twilight, and retard, ok, but what is twilight retard logic?
NOBODY EXPECTS ME!!!!!!!!
SILENCE.
I KNEW YOU WAS ANDY WHTCHAMACALLIT
5The logic they use, which usually defines, in their eyes, that they're always right.
5>>
5What point is there?
7You know, you're just being a total retard because you know I'm right and are trying to completely derail the conversation
Well my logic wasn't that I was always right.
5We're arguing about a nonexistant internet slang word for no freaking reason!
thnx to a certain "Welcome Newbies" post XD*shot*
7No, that was you, being an idiot.
7again.
7surprisingly.
I think it'd kill you to admit you're wrong, so you just jump around, talk crap, and try to confuse people.
05iihows it going?
7Again, I could say the same to you.
2wb?
5It sounded to me, by what I can make out from all this mess, that you're both using that BS filled logic.
<.>
ah
07wb sammich =3
/me 14taps C7
thanks
5Sorry, but I don't think this should even be going on, honestly, all it's turning into now is arguing for the sake of arguing...
Extreme. "Very dangerous or difficult". Falling off a 12ft half-pipe, dangerous.
Therefore, extreme.
/me 7yawns
sammich.....
/me noms on a sammich
05n... noooo
7So, you just fall off it on purpose? That's stupid, not extreme.
wb sammcha
/me was nommed
05its all Kyu's fault
meanwhile, forum flooding is commencing
...You know that I mean if you fall of while dropping in on a skateboard.
/me 5believes that what's going on now is just as stupid as that.
>:D
off*
6áµ€á´´á´±
14o.=.O
7That's what you meant, but it's what you said. You've been using that logic throughout the argument, so you can't bitch.
5I know I'm not on completely nice terms with either of you, but please, it makes it worse if you continue
5I'm begging,
4Just stop.
5><
If I say Fermat's last theorem, do you immediately know what that is?
So if you say Twifag logic, should I immediately know what that is?
What I said simply required common sense.
5Wow. What the hell are you even going on for? Everyone's quieted for the moment, as far as I see, and you just posted more to go on with the turmoil.
5And keeping it going is going to make it worse.
7Yes, as you fully understand the term and have used it yourself.
14Guys....why cant you argue with eachother in a PM on Mibbit? -.=.-
...No I haven't.
Ever.
I know for a fact I have never/would never use such a stupid term.
7You have. But you've got terrible memory problems, you've fucked shit up so many times.
14-.=.-
/me 14facepalms.

I can send it to you if you want.
/me 5frustratedly slams her head into the keyboard and just goes on to distract herself from the ongoing crap.

Would that make you happy?

6>_>
05o ... that sucks...
05sorry Aurora
6yeah :|

05o
05good luck
6I might go wednesday just to spare myself that much nervous problems in one day
05im sure oyu dont need that though :P
05lol
05i hate public speaking
6same
05h aha i make a fool of myself when people are looking but i dont like making speeches
yay it's lag free so far o3o
6apparently I look completely comfortable speaking
6which is good, I don't "look" nervous
6but I sure as heck feel like I wanna curl up and die in the corner
10o3o
05same here, people say i look too relaxed
05but i dont think i do lol
05even in the vid i look the same >.<
6one thing everyone notices during the beginning is my shaking
05terrible feeling though
05lol
10people say I talk way too fast and loud
6somehow, my shaking goes away after I start, but will start up again once I'm done and go back to my seat
10I tend to do that when I know people are listening XD
05i hold my breath then my heart rate goes real slow
05lol
10o3o
05its terrible when people are staring and look bored
I gotta play the metroid series O_O
10XD
05lol
6I like having people look at me, even though I hate being the center of attention
ro-ro-ro-roara
6however, to most people I'm hypocritical, because I myself wont look at someone speaking
6I CAN'T
6I'm drawing or fiddling with my hands, because if my hands stop moving at any time, my mind loses focus
10LOL me too
6every year, I have to go talk to my teachers after class and explain it, because during freshman year I got yelled at alot
6sophomore year too
10XD
05hey me too, i just hate it when they look bored and stare right at you
6I can't help it though
10LOL
6I had a teacher who basically said watch or get detention, so I had no choice
05i alwasy sketch in class!!! I CANT HELP IT... must do something lol
6she watched my grade plummet to a D
6when she let me draw again, I brought it to a B by semester's end
05o D:
05o teach said you better stop looking at your paper and pay attention so ended up drawing on the table, I was liek , hey its not my fault you said i couldnt look!!
10o3o
05random parts of a drawing on the peper and table lol
10XD
6what's funnier is when teachers think they'll get me to watch a movie
man scribblenaughts looks like a lot of fun O_O
10XD
6my science teacher last year was also the same teacher who made me get a D from not drawing
05HA HA HA you mean to actually look at the screen, good luck with that!
6back in sophomore year
6but we were buds o3o
6anyways
05O-o
05lol
10We had a movie day; we watched two movies: one on the Jewish Genocide, before and after (Its a Wonderful Life), and the life of a gay child in a discriminating neighborhood (My life in Pink)
6she thought that she'd get me to watch the screen because she had to turn the lights off
6nope
6I actully drew BETTER with minimal light only from the movie screen
10o3o basically, me and the guys ended up fighting over popcorn while most of us didn't really watch
6and still, I pulled out of that class with an A and a 4 on the AP test (which is amazing o3o)
10LOL XD
05sometimes i played cards during movies if i sat in the back and couldnt get enoguh light
10XDDDD
05POPCORN!!!
05:D
10XD
05if i dont draw in class i dont learn, end of story lol
6same
6I think what was funny was my Junior year ART TEACHER didn't want me drawing in class
6unless it was a project
10o-o
10wow
6I dropped that class at semester's turn, I hated it
05i hated art class
05alwasy tellign me to help others
Why didn't she let you?
6my senior art class was amazing
6kipi, I wasn't "paying attention"
<.>
6she was my most stubborn teacher
05i learnt nothing but how to get frustrated with other students and be sent into the hallway :D my GBA was in my locker :P
05Since those teacher cant draw a stick man worth poo they get mad at us
05lol

/j #aqua-vitae
10tell me when its done
6Hai
13There's a Tokio Hotel fan on the forum, we're all screwed.
13D;
lol
13Btw, does anyone know how to use GIMP here?
10lol
yeah i saw that as 1 of the requests
tokio hotel that is
-_- to lazy to even search it up right now
13dari: is it possible to do layers on there, i.e. lines of something on the top, colors below it? I think I've seen people do it on there on tutorials, but I dunno how to do it
Yeah, let me just open it up so I can explain what to do to you.
13mmkay thanks
What's the latest version of GIMP, I might have an old one?
I have 2.5.6
2.4.6*
13No idea, but I have gimp 2.6
13oh
13ffff there's only two numbers for me
Ok, nevermind.
Should still be pretty much the same.
Open the file you want to have layers on.
Or a new file, or whatever.
Select the window it's in, and press Ctrl+L
13k
The layers window should come up.
Then you can probably work out from there what to do.
The picture icon of the paper means new layer.
The arrows are to move layers up and down.
13Cool, I think I got it
13thank youuuu
Ok.
No problem.
You really should just get PS CS4 TBH.
13lol, I'm too lazy to torrent it, I hardly draw or anything anyways
Don't need to get a torrent.
You download the free trial off their site.
Then replace one 2MB .dll
And it works forever. :)
lol rushed the show so doubt its even that good
07weebls

or cause any trouble
6as I said, I doubt they'll say no
hi

6they most likely will accept, grudgingly, but yes
/me 10doges jumps out of the way of the tornado but drops nintendo

7:O
7ESCHER
12I really like his drawing about him in a mirror ball.
12lol
6that picture was insane o3o
7He's my favorite artist of all time. :D
12Ya it was!!!
12mine too!!!
/me 7even did projects on him and stuff.
12Ovo
6for some reason, I don't care much for artists like that
7o_o
7D<?
/me 12is jealous
6like...
6I dont know how to say it
14^.=.^
7Ever seen Escher's Metamorphosis III?
6I'll have preferences on DA, but in the real world, I'm kinda eh
12no
7http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/metamorphoseIII.jpg
7Long picture warning.
6of course, I just don't like art history much, which makes me avoid any artist I'd learn about in school, which shuts down my knowledge of the real world
/me 10smiles
12now you tell me! lol
12I've seen that pic, It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!
6artists I can relate to, there we go
6that's what I like
6also
6I still need ideas, anyone?
7Really, how many mathematic yet artistic lithographers do you see nowadays? :P
7Ideas for what?
12I like tessellations, there very cool!
6for my painting
6I need to paint something for my friend
12but, I like illusions better.
12yes
/me 10yawns loudly
7Try music. :)
6...
12try a Tessellation
6I do that after I know what I'm drawing
6no
6tessellations aren't my style
12oh ok
7Hmm...
7Draaaaaaaw... your friend!
12XD
6I could...
6hmm
6o3o
12try a non objective painting
6her character, at least
6non objective? what?
/me 10falls asleep
/me 14stretches out and yawns.
7Something abstract.
12Non Objective: a Painting involving no shapes or pics; a painting of emotions
12that...
7Like a dot in the center of a picture representing the simplicity, unity, or identity of a topic.
12lol no
02Sounds like lots of colors
02Since colors show emotion :P
12yes
6I
6HATE
6ABSTRACT
12OvO
7o_o
/me 10opens hes eyes slightly

7You remind me of a younger me. o.o
12then non objective is your style
12Ovo

04So it's the Flahship of his Interstellar fleet
04He's cocky enough to take us on with only it
10I think it's pretty much a...
04And you seem to portray the King as a personality like Kommander Kulez
10flying hangar ship of some kind
10which is epin
04Flagship = Leader of the fleet
02dude Drake
10If you played BF2142, think about the Titan ships *shot*
02I don't
04His PERSONALITY
02The Kommander is more...
02no
02xD
04He's too calm and calculated
02nah
02he's more angry here

03There's a shot here of Beast Boy turning into a gorilla
03and I was like LOL GORILLAZ

03It's still kinda bad, as I don't have a proper instrumental, so it sounds forced
6oh speaking of free iTunes songs, gotta check this week's
/me snores all over Roara
/me 6floofs one Kyu
6*on
6difu
6sifes
03this week's sucks, it won't let me download it without upgrading iTunes
/me uses wakeup slap on kyu
03and iTunes 9 sucks in all meanings of the words
03-d
03*-s
/me blush
6I'm still on iTunes 8 I think
6>_>
6also, LOL at that TT vid
03yeah isn't it funny?
03It's well done for what it's worth but kinda random
6XD
03but anyway, when I went to edit the song it was timed to the background track
03(When I leeched it off LimeWire or whatever years ago, it was the dirty version)
03I have since then replaced the audio track...
6yeah I was wondering about that
6I see what you mean by "forced"
03Yeah
03well I still don't have an instrumental
03just a loop x.x
03and this was a few years ago too LOL
03The second verse was already edited on NOW 8, so I just used that part...
03and the thing that kinda annoys me is the part in the first verse, all the lyrics sites say it's "put you on the hype shift"
03But it obviously sounds like something else...
12how goes?
03huh
03?
03It shows all the parts where they rip off anime styles and stuff
/me goes draggyglomping
6the heck, I'm not waiting 10 minutes to download that >_>
03LOL
03It's good quality, that's why it takes so long :P
6lol
03I swear it was on YouTube
03but I can't find it now
6youtube turned nazist
6to the extremes
6it got deleted no doubt
03LOL
03YouTube has always sucked
03what I want to do is have a free high-definition video sharing site that lets anyone upload whatever they want and doesn't recompress it
03as in, the quality it starts is the quality people see
03though, most idiots who use WMM don't know quality anyway... >_<

6LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
03I need to update that page
06good luck finding a way to afford the bandwidth bills on a site full of uncompressed unlimited duration video, and avoid getting your ass sued off everytime someone uploads a copyrighted movie
03nah, the key is to keep it underground
6lol
03That, and I'd use like... a French webhost

03could be why it's not as fast as it should be, but eh
03I've got a couple full-size DVD ISOs on there and they don'
03*don't care
06I bet it has a fair usage clause in the eula, so you would just get your acount terminated
03but they don't actually have to know what I'm doing with my server
/me runs
03PowWeb is stupid, they don't care
03as long as they make money they seriously don't care
03Typically the way those webhosts work is they let you do whatever you want, but then if they get a complain from like the RIAA THEN they'll do something about it
03the server we have for #Pokemon-Originals is this french host called OVH, they quite literally don't care
06They would care if you where sucking up bandwidth like its candy
03We've been torrenting from it forever, and they prolly got several complaints, and just ignore them
03since France doesn't have the DMCA :D
06RealPlayer 8 Setup.exe < WHY OH WHY
03... LOL
03I should delete that, eh?
06you baddie... qq
03I don't even know why it's there, prolly had a bunch of people request it

03the people who made it got a bunch of C&Ds

12Sorry for silence ^^
12Kinda enjoying my time alone, although I'd prefer Xai to be here
Happy birfday RN
And Happy Engagement too
4Thanks, I was ill all day yesterday on my bday :( but had an 'official' birthday on Sunday so that was good!
4and thanks!
4Still ill now but needed to be back at work due to having a vacation.
12Eeeeee!"
/me pounces RN
12I was just trying to get Burnett on TST LOL
4Eeeeeee by gum
12lol you yorkshire person you
4If he does come on, he'll do his mock bad spelling and grammar thing, it makes me giggle.
4I'm in bed at the min with all the nights off :( illingtons
12Aww meep..
/me snuggles RN to keep her warm with her floofs
4Don't you'll get fox flu!! but thanks :)
4LOLOL
/me wonders how an ice burd can keep someone warm o.o
4Seriously, if they start inventing stuff like fox flu and badger flu, I'll know they're making it up.
Happy belated Birthday RN...?
12I'm NOT an ice bird.. I can manipulate ice but I'm not cold myself >v>
4Thanks Lugia.
12RN we looked over the balcony yesterday and saw a FOXXY!!!!!
XD Sorry
4Arti...you're NOT a pokemon reality check LOLOLOL (taking the micky)
4Awesome!
12XD
12Nah I'm just a ME reality check, I'm a water birdy who uses ice
4People think Ninetales have fire in them like some sort of demented oven.
12LOL
We used to leave dog food out for the foxes that live near us. (Not too often, they were never dependant)
4Wouldn't that cook them?
4Nice! Sometimes we get hedgehogs.
4We also have bats around here.
12Foxes chew hedgehogs ^^
/me runs
Yeah, we get bats too.
12Same, bats are nice <3
4Foxes get spines in them if they hedgies.
4chew*
We have quails
We found a hedgehog in the road about 2 months ago, first time I've seen a hedgehog here.
hello
They don't seem to be very common here.
4Cute - which county do you live in, if you don't mind me asking?
hy
England.
I'm near Reading.
4Awesome, I meant county not country, sorry.
Yo.
Wtf.
Oh right, lol.
Berkshire.
I'm watching A Haunting.
12No one calls it East Yorkshire because Yorkies don't want to be associated with Hull LOOOL
The people in the house this episide are being tormented by SATIN WORSHIPERS.
12It's called Humberside to us XD
Who the hell worships Satin?
My grandmother is from Yorkshire.
12LOL
@_@
4LOL Humberside no longer exists, since 1996.
4We hate it on our letters :P
Sheffield.
12Really, RN?
12Sheffield fails epically..
12South and East Yorkshire should NOT be considered Yorkshire..
12>v>
/me yawns
4Yeah, it really irritates us to have 'North Humberside' on our letters, it's officially East Yorkshire.
4Why? :P
4We were here before you, shove off, haha xD
/me runs
4Now if only tribes had said that to the English...
12XD
>_< freaking storm is coming thats gonna last a few days >_> may lose power
12But it was the romans that took over the English :O
12So the romans are to blame for everything LOL
4the romans took over the druids and stuff
12I suck at history
4and the druids took over the foxies
4I wish we still had wolves here...
Go to a zoo. :P
4I don't like them in a zoo, lol.
4They look bored.
Probably because wolves hunt for pleasure, even when they're not hungry.
4Yeah but that's their nature, can't really blame them for that.
stayed up still 3:00 am playing a video a game
4That's like blaming a bird for singing, heh.
4It's still annoying in the mornings though...
And we aren't allowed to have dogs rip foxes apart from horseback? It's in our nature. :P
4It's only in cruel people's nature in fairness.
(Justt so you know, I don't support that_
4Let's not get into that again haha.
)*
/me falls asleep
4Hi Mike
4The reason wolves go after people is because we hunt too much of their prey in the first place - well not the official reason but my theory. And we encroach too much onto their land.
They don't got after people.
go*
4Well, if I were to do that to a dog, it would be on the national news - so why not with a similar animal?
4Some wolves do I think. But only if sick or something, not sure.
lmao! I havn't done that in a long time since there hasn't been any worthwhile wii games since may
"In a three week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten."
new super mario bros. will change that though
4I don't know things off by heart to recall at will :P
4But fair enough.
lol
I suppose we are sentient, so I don't really have an argument. XD
4But yeah.
4I guess we just don't understand their behaviour as much as we'd like, perhaps?
im confused with the message
4Oh sorry I misunderstood the word 'sentient' - I thought it meant concious.
4Sorry, too ill to spell correctly today.
I'm confused, if they're sentient, then they should have compassion, which they obviously don't.
4Dogs have compassion.
hiho :)
Example?
And I meant wolves having compassion.
4If you're a dog owner you'll already know.
nvm
4Ok.
4Well I guess they don't.
the pm oh i wrote an episode of the dare show months ago never posted on the forum ....oh now ya say nvm lol
They would kill most of species in an area for fun if they had compassion.
wouldn't*
4I'm not usually the debating type, sorry, I always lose at it.
4I get what you're saying though :)
lol sry
Well you're right, I've never owned a dog, so I wouldn't understand. :P
12Right just finished making dinners
12*eats(
4Well, some dog owners don't get it either, but for example: my dog is usually really naughty when I get home (my mum looks after him in the day) but he knows I'm ill and has left me alone without being told. Perhaps not compassion but I hope it makes sense.
4What did you make?
lol i forgot even when i wrote up that show was so long ago......
12Chicken burgers with salad and cooked lentils. Bit of a mixture
oh wait lmao i did post that online but on another forum
4Nice!
4I had stew ^^
12What kind?
4There's different kinds?
4I only know of one, haha.
4Maybe my dog staying away is so he doesn't get ill himself or something.
Yeah, it's that kind of thing that can be argued one of many ways, but can't be explicitly proved in one.
4Yeah true. Hi Ika.
Anyway, BRB.
Hi
4Ok.
hi

10good thx you

12I got a call from Xai ^v^
hooray
finally theres word of another spyro game in the making
10yep
wonder what its gonna be about?
10have you played DotD
Yes i have played dotd.
10be cool if its an open world
03LOL Articuno
03isn't he at work or w/e?
12Yeh of course
12He calls me on his breaks when he gets a chance
03LOL
12I do the same.
Gotta love the open world games
yeah more open world would be great, Online play would be good too, & hopefully it'll be longer too
/me mutters angrily as he is almost finished the Aero sprite
10would be cool if it had side missions
I doubt there will be online gameplay
10be cool if it did tho
the reason i say online play is so we have something to do after we beat the game
u can fight your friends online or co op online play
/me hugs
and hey Altair
Hey
your server was refusing connections lol
10or instead of playing as spyro you can make your own dragon
Yeah, I restarted the computer, because no one was on the server at the time, and I needed to update something.
10gtg'
lol
The server is supposed to auto-start when I turn the computer on, but I found that you added an extra line to the config, and there was a "T" that wasn't commented out, so it didn't start up as it was supposed to.
hmm i would say that would be a online feature where u can do that
that was an accident sorry xD
No problem. XD
xD I didn't mean to do that
Heheh.
xD
I still love Chatops :D
if it had online wouldn't be able to use it anyway......
Wow, 9 people in chat.

I haven't /oper'd up, so I can't see it. :P

03I was just mentioning how when I called you that one time it ate my money
Hm, dunno.
03@ cell phone
hm k
12Lol I've put 20p in and called a land line and it's lasted like an hour
03yeah but for cellphones it was like £1 every couple minutes
03remember that?
12Yeh -v-
03<bluesun> Now they don't accept incoming calls :/
12What, payphones?
03but apparently some smarter payphones there now have like actual computers
03Yes
12Yeh they do
03Not in London apparently
12I call the Leeds station payphone all the time when Xai asks me to LOL
:D
12Oh well, I used to do it in London too
03bluesun said one time a payphone with a built in computer b0rked and had a Windows desktop screen so he uploaded the entire OS to MediaFire
12LOL
X3
03but still, I've never seen a smart payphone
03here they're strictly mechanical

reminds me:
when I get to england, I should turn my phone off
lol why?
each receiving call costs me 30 cents per minute
Ovo
and each going 60
wow
well, roaming fees were lowered
they were around two to three euros per minute last year in fact
:\
so this is considered being "cheap" right now

hi
((^_^))
hi Skylands
/me hugs back
((^_______________^))
10So you've come back to TST for a hiwle?
It's been over a year I think since I been here.
10while**
I decided to return.
10Yay~
Wow, some stuff has changed since I last been here, no?
02Um, yes? *shot*
10Yep
That too...
LOLWUT THE FORUMS
o_O
yes
xD
mrff
I have no idea who you are really :D
So hi strange!
School time
Stranger*
lol
well
Buh bye, everyone.
I'm in school atm :D
02Cya Kipi *licks*
I'm a weird fish person
/me hugs all
with gills who knows splash
well at least last time I was here
forumotion >_>
02Yeah, nothing happens to her
/me hides in his hole
smf looks so much more pr0
anyway im gonna kill some d00ds
/me follows Okan
SMF is also like TST :P
So how is everybody?
lol
TST uses SMF, Shiny
10Fine, and you?
Exactly
We tried PHPBB already
02Tired
And you know how much that...sucked -.-
I'm doing good
actually
Altair already knew about SMF
SAD!!!!
so yeah, he set up an SMF forum
Well honestly
phpBB is win
Keep in mind that the new one is just experimental
I'd get IPB if I could... but damn, it's like $200
02Huh? I haven't started yet...
php > phpBB
XD
And I'm not about to pirate it XD
lul
10Oh, my bad >_<
02I didn't know if you were still gonna ask Aurora
IPB?
/me totally forgot about asking Aurora
lol
02She is pretty busy tbh...
10Yeh
Are you going to tell me, or laugh at me? O_o
10I've already requested that WH pose (which she was clearly agrrevated with since they wouldn't accept it) and a Flygon-wolf
it's another forum software
Google it
xD
Altair
lol
did you put the image I gave you in?
no
im about to play ffs
Also see if you can put the background and cat stuff in your images folder
Oh.
k
there's a few other ones
/me doesn't ask her for pictures, for many reasons
phpbb and smf are best free ones.
and tbh i'd kinda like to break away from the TST-style
10Can I ask why?
02I don't ask anyone for pictures tbh, coz I feel like I'm just botherin them and they have better things to do
10Roara likes ideas
10I gave her a few suggestions in the past
02Yeah
10I really love Lucario's pose
/me spazz-flees
02I've been contemplatin if I should close my old one and re-open a new one
10New one, what?
10dA?
I need to go
well
02No, art topic
IPB would be good
10Ah
but pirating it would be sad
so yeah
Pirating is good.
:P
and PHPBB annoys me like hell
of course
Although adobe deserve it.
but for an actual site...>.>
xD
true
anyway bye
Cya.

But you don't get grounded all the way, really
I get removed from everything from outside and my TV
xD
*but
Well, that's kind of true
I mainly use my comp and nothing else, so it's only natural that I'd ONLY be grounded from my comp

HI SKY
Hey Quil :)
Haven't gone on in a week, yet it feels like forever.
I'm not going to be on though, I'm dead-tired (only got 3 hours of sleep) and I have personal stuff to do.

I only get on now and then myself, considering how bad my Internet connection is
Hey Okan :)
02You know who I am right? Just gotta make sure
My adapter crashes everytime I turn on my computer with it plugged in, I have spend 5 minutes fixing it.

:OOOOOO
/me salivates
10I haven't been obsessed with Lugia since last year, Alt
I've never been obsessed with either Lugia or Articuno. I like both of them, but not to the point of obsession.
6i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove lugia o3o
6probably enough to be considered obsessed
tbh
Based on the number of Os, I'd say so.
i'm same as Aurora
:D
7o3o
7I'm meh with Lugia.
12i liked lugia for sometime
12that was just about it

10Same here, Quan
7School is stressing me out...
12Magic the Gathering
I'm becoming "meh" about a lot of gaming franchises

10Scooby Doo used to be my favourite tv show when I was younger
brb Science
/me is gonna watch his missed episodes of The Jeff Dunham Show
lol
go tvshack.net *shot*
02It's become pretty bad now
Scooby-Doo was awesome
/me 7yawns
Where at?
It hasn't been good in a few years, though.
7I drew myself with my zodiac sign. O_o
=_=;
02YT
7Unfortunately for Kyu, it's now in a doodledump. >:3
07D=
02Kyu, wanna see my Zodiac?
07sure o3o
10"What's New Scooby Doo?" series sucked badly
10I prefer the originals
10the stuff my parents watched when they were in their teens.
02There
7Ah, fine, Kyu; y'wanna see it? O_O
7O_o*
07yush o3o
What's New Scooby Doo? wasn't that bad
It had some really fun episodes
7I can post my incomplete doodledump, but you'll have to look through all of my KH fanart. X3
10The one movie they aired recently on CN was dumb
10Scooby Doo: The Mystery Begins
02Yes, I didn't even watch it
02Commercials were enough to turn me away >.
02>.>*
Pup Named Scooby-Doo > Original series > everything else
10Pup Named Scooby-Doo. 8D
7Whoo, my doodledump still hasn't loaded.
/me has a question
7Yes?
o_O
02I'm kind of mad that Dialga got about 3 movies to star in
6yeah, well
6it's a trilogy >_>
7KY
7U
02Yeah, well none of the others got it
7Dang, why can't I hit that U? D:
02They aren't so special >.>
/me 7pokes Kyu over 9000 times
6stop complaining >_>
/me 6runs
02Me? Sorry
Dialga isn't very special, either.
07?
02I just said that
6well...they're freaking origin creatures
Kyu!
7I got my incomplete doodledump
6time, space, the origin one
6of course they get the trilogy
02Mew was the origin of life, Groudon of land, Kyogre of sea
7http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/850/doodledump.png <-- Note; there are oldish, newish, and KH stuffzors. O_o
6I'm not the franchise operators
7A sketch of Rora, a not-impressed Kyu, and me.
6HE HECK?
6THE
6DFKJFD
07lol o3o
6it's pronouced "Ar-kee-us" >_>
7O_o?
7Not Ar-kay-us? O_o
6nope
That's right, Roara.
I've always said it that way. What's so surprising?
6...
6>_>
02I still pronounce it Are-see-us
6^that
That just sounds wrong based on the phoenetical structure.
7o_o
/me lols
6and for those who don't understand phoenetical structure?
7Whenever you see a 'ce', it's usually pronounced 'see'..
6that's just how I started saying it
7Cesium, Celcius, Cell... o3o
6yeah
02Ce = "see" or "se"
...you guys don't get it
02Usually as Quan pointed out
6Andy, I just explained why I don't
You don't see an /r/ before the "ce" very often, do you?
6...
6 17:26	Aurora	and for those who don't understand phoenetical structure? <-this includes me, in case it was missed.
fffs lag D:
7What does an R have to do with anything?
7The word 'scarce', for example.
The phonemes before and after certain other phonemes determine how they are pronounced and also
7You don't pronounce it 'scark', do you?
...which phonemes are reasonable by the structure of the word
That's because there's nothing after it
7What about 'scarcer', then?
You have a point with that
hallo
Ar-kee-us still sounds FAR better than Ar-see-us, though
02Not to me
6not to those who say it ar-see-us :P
!lag
o_O
lol wrongness
laaaaaaaaaaaaag
02Don't care
6hey that's fine
!lag
6I don't pronounce dialga "daialga"
6..
-.-'
6*deealga
6I pronounce it daialga
02same lol XD
this lags so much D:
6and for the longest time, I said "keeoger" for kyogre
7I pronounced 'kai-oh-ger' and 'dee-alga' .3oo
7o3o(
7o3o*
7But not 'sui-COON'. Why the emphasis on the second syllable, I must wonder.
I say "Kyogre" the same way I've always said "Kyu" lol
the hell
Kyu ogre? No offense to Kyu.
so laggy
7O.o
also computer is on low battery D:
6I used to say "soo-ee-cune"
6not putting the first two together
bleh, who cares anyway? I just didn't realize that I was in the minority for Ar-kee-us.
"Are-see-us" just doesn't sound... godly
7Not in the English language, maybe.
6sounds more godly than arkeeus imo
02^this lol
6also
uh, Noah's ark
Bible, etc.
7Ar-kay-ous sounds better than that., though. o3o
6japanese pronunciation had the "see" in it
7Sounds like 'arcane'.
6which is where I got it
Let me reiterate: the phonemes in Japanese and English differ a LOT
6that's cool
6I'm calling it how I want
Both are very fascinating languages
/me 7lols at her cat randomly
wb
07not to mention the PBR guy calls it ar-see-us

2"She decided to take her chance. She began to glow with a white light as she healed herself with Moonlight while also using a Quick Attack to get in close to Saru" <== !? Moonlight... she /does/ know its daytime, right!?
2whatever
As I was saying
2"Dark energy coursed around Saru's body, making her cry out. Tentacles of what seemed like black lightning ran all over Saru's body. Ace then let go and jumped off Saru's back, knocking her to the ground face first on the dirt. Saru's muscles twitched as a few strands of black lightning showed in those areas. Saru was still alive but she was paralyzed from th
2the prolonged contact.
/me types up more SL
2O-o wth? You're not allowed to kill anyone. Period. 'Sides, the "tentacles of black lightning" seems sort of dysfunctional

12lolwut
10BACK
12wb ^v^
12hey, feather, Ive seen a lot of people talking bad about the DSi internet, pic, and video quality, do you think all that stuff is really true?
10video?
10you can't record/watch videos on the DSi o_o
10anyway POSTED COMMENT XD
12oops I was thinking of the voice recorder lol
10oh
12lol ya
12so, do you think its true?
10picture quality in my opinion is really good
12and, what about the internet?
10not as good as a super camera, but it's good for a DS camera
12oic
10internet is super slow
12oh I thought so LOL
10but great if you want to check something real quick on the internet without turning on the computer
10voice recording..
10you can only record 10 seconds
10which sucks
10but pretty good quality
12Can you join forums and chat rooms on the DSi internet?
12oh ok
10forums, yes
10chat rooms, no
10if it requires java
12Dang! lol
12that sucks
12I heard it has a shorter battery life because of the wider screen.
12and all of the other stuff.
12Do you like GBA games feather?
10never played many GBA games
12oh ok
10just Leaf Green, Emerald, and KH CoM
12I have a lot of gba games
12lolwut
10I gave it 200 stars XD
12XDXD
10check out my comment too XD
10http://d30yeejxd3syp9.cloudfront.net/qm/thumbnail/11539846093497745735_o.gif
12omg XD
12do you play any RTS games?
10RTS?
12Real Time Strategy...
10never heard of it
12like Warcraft
10never played that o-o
12lol ok
12have you ever heard of Starcraft 2!
10nope LOL
/me 12is EXTREMITY surprised
12WHAT!!!
12XD
10XD
12its one of the best games in the world...
RTS= strategy game where if you stop paying attention for a few seconds, the enemy comes in and murders you
12even if it isn't released yet
12your right Qiulava
12have you ever heard of StarCraft Quilava?
yes. and I was terrible at it.
12lol
ADHD + game where you need to concentrate = quick death.
12how about StarCraft 2?
2o-0
12Ovo
12has anyone heard of the 12/12/12 theory?
that there are actually twelve twelves on that day?!
12lolwut
12I mean 2012
12dose anyone think that theory is not true?
because it aint
12lol yes...
12they say that the earth, the sun, and the black hole on the center of the galaxy is going to line up...
07lol
12but, what they don't tell you is that they line up on that date every time XD
07they say millions of things
12yes
12yes they do
eh I heard something else.
12like what?
some planet is going to crash into ours on that date
12XD OMG
12that is soo false
not really.
12Exactly!!!
we don't know much about space
12I do!
12anyone think that an alien invasions happening on earth is very rare, raise there hand.
rare yes, impossible, no
/me 12raises hand
12lol your right
it hasn't happened yet. thats all you need to know
07pretty darn close to impossible though o3o
not really.
I could explain it if you want.
12the only reason that an invasion would happen is ether for ruling or resources.
doesn't have to be an invasion even.
12???
chances of meeting another alien species
12is about 2%?
lol
12lol
Lower
you'd need to attach that percent to a time frame.
12well, Titan is like our earth in the early stages...
12so in about 200,000,000,000,000 years, there will be life on it lol
07any type of transportation that travels slower than light would have to be pretty huge and self-sustaining for hundreds of years o3o
unless it bends spacetime.
07doesn't seem practical for any species to try
12well...
12there is a way to travel faster then light...
you KNOW we will at some point
12it is very complex.
12Tachyons
is that a theory, or actually proven?
12I think thats how you spell it?
probably
12I think it was proven that they travel faster then light?
12but there slowest speed is as fast as light
12watch the universe, it will give you all the answers ^v^
/me coughs
07theory~
2o-o
12 0v0
/me 2pokes 365
12what?
2it always sounds like you're completely sues that you're both right and you know what you're talking about
2and then you get proven wrong o3o'''
12OvO
12just watch "The Universe" on the history channel.
2o-o
12what!?
/me 2doesn't believe that stuff, honestly
12-v-
2o3o it gets you mixed up between theories and facts
07just because it's on tv doesn't make it proven o3o
12yes I know.
2o3o also counts for the internet and other peoplr
2*people
12lol

07gonna decide this weekend
closing date is today.

07>.-.< extend it D=
I can't
I can't possibly make the form after Thursday evening
and I can't leave it another week and a half
there are postal problems in the uk right now >v<
that's why I'm starting early this year
04Meh
04I'd join
04But my parents >..
04>.>*
04They don't want me to reveal our address
04They are so paranoid about the internet
04Bah, my dad won't even let be a member on Runescape, even though I have the money
04Hey!
04I'm Australian
04lol
even worse
your parents shouldn't be paranoid at all but they just are
04They are just trying to protect me
04But I agree
04They are WAY too paranoid
07XD
04I am careful on the internet
04I would never be crazy enough to reveal anything more than my country and age
04LOL
lol
riiight
Arti
04My dad hates me being on the PC anyway, whether it's internet or not
07in any case if I can't have time to decide, I'll just join o3o
04So I hate bringing up anything to do with my PC while my parents are around
Paper cuts hurt, ya know! D:
04lol
04I love those random quotes on the Chat stats
meep
if someone calls your name in public, strangers might know who you are then!
its no different to the internet

Well, the person who got it was in year 9
they got free laptops from teh government
but couldn't connect to NSRradio

she hacked the key o-o
because they secretly will be future FBI haxxors fighting terrorists on the internets.

07As well as i thought the deadline for emails was todaaay
07Hm Articuno I was also thinking about the role of this community o.O
12Hmmm?
07You know how we've defined it as a shelter in the past - I was just wondering if it was still like that
07or if it's more 'normalised' now
12I don't know.
12I don't see as many sad peopel coming to the chat as I used to
07Mm
07Arrow and I were discussing that just now so I was wondering about your opinion
12That's a good thing I think.. it probably means people are uplifted by us
07Yeah =)
Articuno,
12Wow thats some real skill.....
07It's incredible isnt it o.o
07And Articuno I find the history of this place interesting

MEEP!!!! ^v^ Winter is almost here! I'm excited.

12I sit at work with my jacket on >v<
/me meeps and cuddles Arti
07I love it
07o.o;
07but it is cold yes
I like winter. Too cold is easier to correct than too hot.
And Arti, yeah I'm not a lover of the winter (Spent 2 years in my old place without heating), but even with heating it's still too cold, the only thing I like about winter is the snow XD
For some reason, I don't mind either the summer or winter. ovo
I LOVE the summer
I hope I can come to a TST meet someday if I visit England. ^v^ I want to meet my friends.
I am with you on that one Vyl ;>

Gah! >v< I'll brb.
meep kk
12You know, Jess never says anything nice to me these days :/
:\
12I'm starting to wonder why I ever called her my best friend..
12Whenever I write a facebook status or something on forums, she'll just reply with something downright rude or whatever
Back.
12I'm really glad I have someone like RN.. she asked me to be her bridesmaid <3 I'm honoured
!
07what does she say? z.z
07and well asdfafffdfdf BRIDESMAID
07when are they getting married anyway?!
07A long time off like you and xai? LOL
12Well, we were talking about our number plate and she replied with ">.<" first then something like "You didnt HAVE to spend that much, NO number plate is worth that you know" and lots of bitter emotes.. Ovo
12Yes a long time off
12She can't just ever say something nice lately
I think that number plate thing was well worth it ovo
hi Feather
/me squeeeeshes Feathyyyyyy!!!!!!!
10EEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep~~
FEATHER!!!!!!! ^v^
07Articuno I dont know
/me glomps Arti
07Jess sounds like she harbours a lot of flail emotions
/me glomps Feathy
12It's not as if this is something we have to keep paying for, it's like a house, you keep it for life unless you decide to sell it on, by then the value has risen
/me glomps back ^^
Not just that, but that number plate (X41 FOX) was just plain awesome
/me glomps Feather
12and most importantly, if we didn't win that auction.. it would NEVER be ours, just like a giant Lugia plush but worse as there is only one of this
/me glomps back :o
Hi Feather! ^v^ *hugs*
07Mmm
07I understamd

07Alright
Argh! >v< I lost my train of thought. That happens to me too often these days.

2*sighs* It also seems that I've lost my motivation for art these days as well. =v= Whenever I pick up my sketch books, I can't even draw anything.
Speaking of drawing
I might be drawing random stuffz tonight
I'm drawing NOW
2I highly doubt I'll be able to get my motivation for art back easily when I get my new computer on my birthday.

03If there was an event for the Azure Flute or whatever, sure
03but there isn't, not even in Japan
02I hope they do make it wi-fi
12I thought every event is also going to be on the Mystery gift Wifi?
02Coz I'm not allowed to go to Toys R Us just for something pokemon related
03LOL
/me runs

02Not that I know of
03Hm
02But if I know my dad, I could go down and ask him, he'll go into his office mumbling, then come back out with one
03o.o
03Flash carts are something you can only buy online
03so he probably wouldn't
02You think he wouldn't have one?
03LOL
03ask?
/me runs]
12Ovo
02Hey, I'm trying to avoid my dad, not walk up to him
03o.o
02What's it used for?
03Pirating DS games
/me hides
02Na
12Ovo
03Because then you can like
03put a ROM Of Pokémon
03and you'll have a .sav file
/me runs
02Sounds like that R4 that NS always talks about
03Yes.

03R4 is one brand of flash carts, possibly the worst kind
12Ovo;;
02I wouldn't know lol
12isn't doing that stuff illegal?
03Yes?
03and your point is?
/me runs
12Ovo

03because it's awesome?
12in a chatroom
03again

03The government doesn't know what goes on here./
12nothing
03Anyway bbl, my class is over
02Talking about it and talking about doing it are two different things lol
4Downloading movies is illegal but if you can't afford to buy them why not haha
12Ovo;;;
02I watch all my movies on YT
4Same with music - not everyone has stacks of money.
02Then again, we have Netflix so it's not that big a problem
12lol
12Netflix looks cool from the commercials
02It's pretty nice
4I used to rent from LoveFilm but they took too long and mixed things up.
12like gametap
02Ya mean gamefly?
12ya
02Gametap is a place where you play old games on the computer
02For money of course
12oh lol
02Lol, Netflix is going to put the movie stores out of buisiness
4They shouldn't charge so much then, lol
12XD
02Well, Hollywood now has this new deal for people, I didn't pay attention to it really
4It's called using public wifi so they can't trace you, hehe.
12XDDDDDDDDDDD
4Well they CAN but...they would rather fine people for accidently dropping litter.
I have other 80 downloaded movies, nearly 19000 downloaded music files and over 4000 downloaded games :P
over*
12Ovo;;;;
O_o;;
02DL FTW!

:P
I download way too much lol
4That's why I'm on unlimited downloads
Same RN
12All I DL is mods and hacks for starcraft!
4I wish they'd do an unlimited dongle but they never will
4they give a paltry amount in downloads for dongles
I dread to think how much my bill would be if I wasn't on an unlimited package XD
12like oblivion
Castlevania forever
4Me too...

4Ah ok
12I hate rap but I know you can't have rap without the swearing XD
03well there's plenty of clean rap, it just seems to not be popular
03Yes you can!
12You physically can but like you said, it's not popular

4This one's the mcdonalds rap it's so funny Arti
12Even more than normal rap
03well
4They rap their order at the drive through
Rap sucks in general
12XD
03it seems now a lot of hip-hop music is going back to where it used to be - somewhat clean
12I can appreciate rap, it's raw talent. But I don't like it myself.
no one wants to listen to rap if they aren't dropping the F-bomb every other line
4I need a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce
03Like, look at a few popular songs now... Iyaz - Replay, Jay Sean feat. Lil'Wayne - down, etc

/me puts Clint Eastwood back on
03Why is that song so addicting again LOL, I've been looping it for 2 days
/me 14»»7 WinAmp 14«»7 Reflekt feat. Delline Bass - Need To Feel Loved (12' Club Mix) 14«»7 04:51/07:24 [7¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦5¦¦¦¦¦7] 14«»7 320 kbps n/a 14««
12I've been listening to this
12LOL
12A lot of ?'s
03oh Articuno, get this
/me 144Dr6ag7on3St12er14eo -- 07Genesis - Dance On A Volcano --14071414 071414Status --0714 00:0207/1405:53 -- 07320Kbps
03I bought this mp3 player on eBay, right
10Alt!
10Sup
03and the guy was clearly an idiot
03like all his songs reeked of LimeWire
03well anyway
03I was like "ooh, Cascada"
03start listening to this one track
12He didn't format it?
03and I was like, WTF is this
03and looked, the song didn't even exist
12Ovo
03he had it tagged as a remix of Everytime We Touch, despite the lyrics being COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
03So I used my song ID program
03turns out it's a completely different person
12that reminds me of a pic that was funny
03>_>
03and Articuno, nope
03I stole all 27GB of his music ^_^
12Ovo;;
03there was some good stuff on there, most of it was just badly tagged LOL
where's kyu? >"
>:*
12idk
03well, that mp3 player has issues. There's a huge dent in the back, and I have a feeling the hard drive is corrupted as even with Rockbox on it it takes like 20 seconds to load a song >_>
03if I could find a cheap 1.8" hard drive I'd swap the thing out, maybe with a SSD even
nm, installing cod:mw2 :D
you?
I just stick to cheap mp3 players to be honest
got a 2gb one and a 2gb iPod nano
03EW IPODS
03Right now I'm using an 8GB Sansa e280, $75
03take that Apple and your stupid $150+ POS products
12my mom has an itouch
03Mainly because I broke my Zune :P I'm gonna get a new one as soon as I get my warranty check
I don't bother with these pathetically overpriced Mp3 players lol
03iPod Touch was the only one that didn't completely suck, but even then they aren't that great
03Zune HD is the most amazing thing ever, though
4I just use an mp3 player that funnily enough plays music xD
12Im hoping for a n I phone lol
Give a me a cheap £10 MP3 player and I'm happy
03and I need at least like, 80GB of music
/me runs
03EW IPHONES
12Ovo
12huh?
03OMG
03hold on
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPYM-XTqcec
03LOL
03Well
12Ovo
03with my 80GB Zune, I believe I had 15GB of music and another 45GB of videos
03it was almost full
03hence why I'm gonna get the 120GB one ^_^
4and if it gets lost of stolen...you cry
4lol only kidding
4or*
03My first one DID get stolen
03and I saved up my money that I made over the summer to buy a new one.
03that's why I have this Sansa, LOL, as a backup
4Did you use the Saw technique on the culprit?
4If not, why not!
03...
4lol
03I don't know who took it
RN that's one of the reasons why I avoid high-tech mp3 players :P
03it was my own fault though
4Same with me with phones
03because I left it out when I went to use the bathroom
03came back, and it was gone
4I walk my dog in rough areas at night...so don't take anything out, not even money
03well why would you leave your phone lying around?
Hi Kyu
My phone was £100 brand new (worth like £20 now LOL)
12hello kyu ^v^
4Hi Kyu
03*FTW
03I usually have a ton of valuables with me
4Yeah but you haven't seen the people who hang round my area at night xD
4Then again I'd just bite their hands or something...
12brb
03like now, my laptop, my phone, this mp3 player, a bunch of cash in my wallet, my debit card, my MOM's credit card...
4that freaks people out and usually they run away lol
03LOL
/me 144Dr6ag7on3St12er14eo -- 07Ozzy Osbourne - I Can't Save You --14071414 071414Status --0714 00:0707/1403:32 -- 07320Kbps
4only if they are trying to rob you, don't do it for no reason
03Well that's why you don't walk in dark alleys at night.
03It's really common sense
4I HAVE to
03I take the buses everywhere
4the dog needs to be taken out
03and o.o why?
03so, go to somewhere bette rlit
4and it's dark when I get home
03*better lit
4There isn't anywhere like that here LOL
03fail
03around here EVERYWHERE is lit short of literal alleys
03the roads, mainly
03that's what sidewalks are for :P
4Yeah same here, it's boring to go on the same streets to take the dog out though
4what are they gonna rob, my hair?
4my shoes or something? lol
Anyway guys I'm heading to bed, I be tired
03LOL I don't think your dog cares
03if you go the same streets
03that's what we do :P
4I care, I get bored
03Heh
nearly 9pm and I'm going to sleep, wow what is this world coming to *shot*
03well my dog likes sleeping 24/7
03so we let her
03LOL
4No, my dog doesn't care as long as he can pee on the lampposts
Anyway night all
4Go around with a bullet proof vest and a helmet lol
Lol.
03they could still shoot you in the foot
4then again your dog would need the same.
/me runs
4Again, what for, to steal a shoe? xD
4probably
4Of what, if you have nothing on you?
03they don't know that
4but yeah I get your point
03they'd assume you have a wallet at least
Wear steel plated shoes.
4I don't carry anything when I have the dog with me.
03whose fault is that?
/me runs
03but seriously, I think most people are just paranoid
4Why would I need to? lol
4Don't need my phone, don't need money.
03it's like the parents who think all the people their kids talk to on chatrooms are rapists
4lol I know xD like your parents
/me runs
03whoen in reality like, less than 1% are
03*when
10not homework
10lol
4those that are have never left their house in 30 years anyways...
03just like how I don't think most strangers are out to get you
03they're probably just minding their own business too
03but I don't live in a ghetto, either
03and LOL yeah I know my parents are stupid
03Heck
03my sisters, my mom, AND my dad all completely ruined a computer since I've been in college
03I'm the only one that hasn't LOL
Most adults aren't out to get you, it's mainly the chavs.
6Gawd D:<
With their tiny knives.
4Tax collectors and traffic wardens are out to get us.
03No they aren't :o
12Friggin' tax..
4Yeah but those tiny little knives are useless against magnets you know.
031. Traffic doesn't apply if you're a pedestrian :
03*:P
12Xai gets taxed like 45% of his wage
4I get taxed something but can't do the maths
03that's because it's the UK
/me runs
4£200 a month out of £1,300
4something like that
03Like, had I been bothered I coulda gottn like half my money back from the VAT if i wanted to
12pff yeh same
03when I went there
03and yet the Democrats say we should raise taxes, PSSSH
/me run2s
03*runs
03but seriously, like
4Yeah but the people who run the country are posh people who have no idea how poor people live
03My flat rate this summer was $425 a week, and I think I actually made about $375 a week
12You ought to live here
4or normal people for that matter
03That's like... not bad?
03I think all politics sucks in general
03I'm not saying I'm pro-Republican either, I hate all political parties
12They tax the rich WAY too much
03Articuno, they claim they want to
03but they don't actually care
12Everyone claims, whatever
4Yeah...my mum is having to pay £300 back to working tax credits because they 'accidently' overpaid her :(
I agree with that. Politics sucks.
4I'm paying it for her but still.
03our school is having this seminar soon on how Obama hasn't actually DONE anything since he got into office
03I should go to that, it looks interesting.
12Thats why Xai wanted to be a politician, but it isn't happening anymore.
4It is actually better for my mum to go on benefits, she'd get more money, she isn't like that though.
03heh
03I've had a few people say I'd make a good world ruler
/me hides
4I think it's impossible to rule and keep everyone happy which is the dilemma really.
10meh, i'll do it tomorrow
03The key is to realize that the majority of "your" country is complete morons ^_^
/me runs
But they can't even rule and keep most people happy.
03LOL, yeah
4By rule I meant be in power, hope you know what I meant.
No referendum - fail.
03I'm all for not having as many fricking laws
03Same with rules on chatrooms, etc.
03I'd say common sense should be the main rule
4Laws against people's private time = fail, like a recent one here.
03and like, "take the admins seriously"
4I can't mention it here.
12I can't believe people think Obama hasn't done "anything"
03where they try to rule what you can and can't do with stuff you own
12If you don't go to war, you're doing nothing lol
03You buy a movie, you're not allowed to rip it, you can't copy it, you can't do ANYTHING
03And you're technically only supposed to play it on "licensed" DVD players
03and that's only ONE THING
03The list goes on and on
03like, why can't they just mind their own busienss?
4You can have horrible crap in your food but you can't have anything herbal in it...
You can rip it here.
03*business
03LOL
As long as you don't distribute it.
03like about cops not being able to have guns? That's not common sense.
03The bad guys can have guns, BOOM all the cops are dead
03Whoops?
12So even though there's a law for it, we generally look at everything individually....
03I generally just follow the laws I feel like :P
03I mean, I don't do anything STUPID
03Like go around drunk in public
03or drunk at all;
12Actually police or ANYONE rarely get shot here!
lol
03LOL
4that's even worse
03LMAO
12Because guns arent allowed
03Articuno, but so?
03Piracy isn't allowed
12and yes some police DO have guns
03does anyone acutally follow it?
03People will do what they want
03That's key
03and you have to realize that
12Its harder to get guns under our laws than to pirate movies LOL
12DUH
03so by making more stuff illegal you're just being stupid
12No, it works here
03LOL
12People don't use guns
03Yeah
4Yes they do, on foooood
12But guns are allowed there
03my uncle has a whole rack of them
12Thats the point
03they're legal, but...
12It's SO stupid
by
03LOL
4You know what...
03well I think they should make handguns illegal
12and yes I know there are plenty of other lethal things but guns make things EASY, everyone knows that.
03I mean, as in not sell them
4is it illegal to carry knives home if you just bought them for meat etc
03shotguns and rifles are fune
03*fine
4LOL
03as you can atcually legitimately use those to hunt
12Shot guns and rifles are only given here to people with lisensces
03but wtf are you gonna do with a handgun or assault rifle besides kill people?
03Same...
03but it's not exactly hard to get a gun license
4Arti - those people are normal psychos themselves though...
03I could go get one right now if I wanted
03I mean
12yeh
4normally*
03if you have a gun license here
03you can buy, like, an AK-47
03WHY!?
12well just look at Tier LOL he's obsessed with guns
/me runs
03WTF are you gonna do with one
4Like they would shoot you for accidently going on their land and stuff.
12XD
4Tier wants them for zombies though
03well, see
4which is something in itself
03What I think makes sense
4Hi Gullie
12It does and it actually works in the UK
03People should be able to do whatever the heck they want in the privacy of their own home
03but only in public should stuff be illegal
03I mean, short of like, killing someone
12Um, like kill people?
03No
03but I mean
12Can I kill you in my home? LOOOOOOL
03No.
03I mean, things like drugs and w/
03e
4If you're playing a game against him lol
The common sense rule applies to that.
03not that I'm in favor of them
03but people are still gonna do it
03so they should just ban things like smoking IN PUBLIC
12People who take drugs are NOT gonna just stay in their homes ffs
I go by natural selection.
03If you want to go f*** yourself up, then that's your problem
03Articuno, that's when you catch them.
If you're stupid enough to take drugs, then you can, and it's your fault if you die.
12Then it shouldnt be made legal.
03they should have the same for piracy
4Arti...what about people who are sensible though, for their private use...not on about class a drugs.
12So that you CAN catch them
03You should be able to watc h whatever you want at home
03just if you start giving out copies, then that's different
4brb
03but that's precisely why I'll ever get caught, or like anyone else :P
03because I don't advertise it
03besides like... on IRC
/me runs
12I am highly against drugs and don't actually see any of it as sensible
03I am too
12Class C drugs are still dangerous drugs!
03but you have to realize that people are still gonna do it
03and it's more fun to point and laugh
12Yes
/me runs
12lol
4Hmm Arti...just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's dangerous.
o_o
03but like
12But they are
03look at how much prohibition failed
03people still drank anyway
03worse than before, even
4Hmm I'm not even going to argue against that one.
12I thought people got taught this in schools :/
12Ok
03LOL
4They get brainwashed about it.
well we get taught
03Who pays attention in school?
/me hides
as for if anyone cares...
Yes lol
Alcahol kills a hell of a lot more than any class C drug, so why is that not banned?
03Yeah seriously
03Like
03they "taught" us about copyrights
4I got brainwashed that sex would kill you
03I chose to completely ignore it
4My point is
LOL what
4don't listen to what they say just cos they say it in school
No one would have what?
12Ok, my school was actually realistic
03LOL, alcohol WAS banned
i don't listen to any of it anyway :(
03and look how much it failed
4Mine wasn't
12and I know the facts as well, I know that what school taught us is actually true,
03I like the laws now regarding that though
4Hmm ok
03it's illegal to be drunk in public
03or carry open alcohol
4But I can tell you, stuff like that isn't dangerous. Not that I'm promoting it of course.
12It is here too but no one follows up on that law :/
03you can do w/e you want at a bar, but if you leave, good luck getting away
03LOL
those laws are silly
03especially on college campuses, they *do* enforce it
4It's illegal to be tired when driving too but they don't act on that either.
12I can tell you it is, because I've experienced it, not myself of course
12But people close to me
4Ah right well not to everyone it isn't.
03Heh
03well I gotta go to a class
03BBL!
k bye
12No I mean the public would outrage
4For some people, what they do in private isn't dangerous just because people are brainwashed in school about it, and they usually don't leave the house.
Oh right.
4But ok.
12I lived in a druggie estate when I was younger.
My point is, why do you think that alcahol is fine, when it kills sooooo many more people than any drug?
4I'm not on about heavy, everyday use, Arti.
12I don't.
12I HATE alcohol
12But I don't want to start on that
4Me too but...once or twice is fine.
12Here's my two cents as well,. WHY screw with your own head? Sure once or twice is fine but its DRUGS ffs, what IS the point? ovO
4>.<;
12Same with drinking, I see no point in getting drunk, it's stupid to mess with your own brain
to get high, lol
12It's like, wtf
4I can't help what your school taught you.
4I'm not promoting drugs...it's just...why legal in one country and illegal in another?
i mean, things like smoking cigarettes... lol
12RN, I don't just take what people tell me and believe it all, I learn about these things myself before I start talking about wjhy I hate it
They're for weeding out idiots of the world.
I think there are far more constructive ways to be happy than to take a drug.
there isn't any point to those, it doesn't make you feel any different then before you smoked
12Yes there are
4-_-
12What, ciggarettes?
yes
12The nicotine in it relaxes you
12It is a stress reliever
you know what i mean lol
12That is why people smoke.
4I'm not talking about drug dealer type drugs.
12Meh I guess
12Nor am I RN
most people i know smoke because they think it's cool etc
4Well...give people a break at least?
12I am talking about cannibis, the one people take as a social thing nowadays
I think people smoke because it's a way of getting friends. As Altair said.
12Meh sorry, I hate drugs probably as much as you hate hunting
12and I support hunting so..
well tbh when i meet people who smell like smoke i tend to shy off 8D
12Well not all of it
4You support hunting now? ^^;
12For food, yes
it makes you smell like a bum lol
4And cannabis - is legal in the Netherlands, where people are tolerant ^^; I'm not saying it's good but people have the right to decide for themselves
4Yeah for food hunting is fine.
^ this
12Yeh they do but I still think it should stay illegal here
4Hmmm
What about hunting to reduce an overpopulation?
12Otherwise you could say people have a right to decide whether to kill other people or not lol
12Yes that as well Arrow, I support that if it's humane
Two different things.
imo, sport hunting is okay but whe/
*w/e
12Especially if other wildlife is at risk
Doing drugs is deciding something for yourself.
Killing someone else if making a decision for someone else.
I mean, I don't support drugs
4But Arti...that's just OMG DRUGS AND DRINK being brainwashed by school...not being funny ^^;
12Doing drugs has an effect on loads of people :/
but hell
12Unless of course you have no family or friends who care
i know many people who smoke weed like i don't even
12sweet pic featehr
10I finally got a pic of our new puppy up o:
12It's not brain washing
and they are getting better grades then I am
4I didn't by the way.
destined for college, etc
4Just an example.
Banning them is a waste of money, if you are stupid enough to die, because you've taken drugs, I don't think that they should be stopped to be honest.
feather, that's cute~
Because if they are determined, they will do it anyway.
4Or having a quiet drink on their own at home with no one else in is bad?
@RN - Second hand smoke is actually deadlier than smoking yourself. I remember reading that before.
12RN, cannibis can make people do stupid things including hurting other people.
10thanks o:
that's why I think it should be legalized lol
4Arrow...it's in designated areas.
tax the hell out of it too
4Articuno it does that to some people yes but not all.
12But thats why it's dangerous.
And who else is in those designated areas? The children of those who smoke.
12You can't tell.
anyway im gonna go try out MW2
4But people decide for themselves
Cannibis is relaxing, and a pain releaver.
12and in the process they could cause other people problems
4Can people stop being against stuff just for the sake of it lol
Which is why you wouldn't be able to do it in public, only in your own home.
4So what you're trying to say is, I'm not allowed to do some things I'd never ever do at home just because you say so? ^^;
12But thats why it's stupid that people do it in public,.
4Not that I smoked
4I can't smoke anyway
12No Im not saying you shouldnt smoke at home.. you can smoke in your home all you want but in public it's inconisderate and dangerous
4Arti, it's a different culture in the netherlands...it's anything goes
4I'm not into smoking drugs...I didn't mean that.
Cannabis has its medicinal uses yeah but illegally it does three major things: 1. It gives children the impression it's good to smoke, thereby removing the "choice" you guys said they would have previously; 2. It further funds illegal activity; 3. It affects those around you as well.
12People have had asthma attacks due to horrible people smoking in their presense
I think that you should be allowed to do what you want to your own body in the privacy of your own home.
4I think you should do that but pay your own medical insurance.
4and not leave the house or harm others
12Yeh but people do.
12Thats the problem
I'm fortunate to be in Canada. It's illegal to smoke in a public place here.
12I don't care who gets hammered in their own house but if it's on a train where Im trying to relax, I will get so mad.
4Sensible people don't...who just want to relax.
12It's not fair.
4in their own home
12Yes but we're talking about in public here
Well they can't just go and ban it right at once, it's a slow and gradual process.
12Like I wouldn't exaclty want to walk into a cafe to get food and have to be greeted by a cloud of drugs
4I'm talking about people like me...if I decided I just wanted a quiet drink at home, not going online, being old enough, not going out, no one in the house, not having a bad mood...that would be fine yes?
They are eventually going to restrict it further, and further.
I meant smoking in general.
12Yes I don't care who drinks at home, gosh even I have a drink with my meals at home when I want to chill
4I wasn't meaning in public either...and in Amsterdam there is only specific cafes where you can do that and people know beforehand what's in there.
10lol
Here's a question for you - if you're going to do bad things to your body, why pay a company to do it for you?
12Well fair enough but what if someone walks home cpompletely high and decides to knock someone out randomly because they don't care?
"Hi, we're here to rot your lungs for $10 a piece".
12That sort of thing, I've seen it happen.
4I disagree with that, yes Arti, but I've never seen that.
Just because you're high, doesn't mean you're going to hit someone.
You are more likely to do that if drunk.
12I know
So you are saying pubs should be made illegal?
Because peopel get drunk then go home drunk and hit people on the way?
12and I hate people getting drunk, the problem is.. you can have a drink without getting drunk but a lot of people get high on very little cannibis
4What I don't get is - what do college students do in places where booze is banned?
4Arti - I hope it's not wrong to talk about it here, if so correct me...
Drink Sprite? XP
It's what I do >.>
12Er actually I just wish people would drink sensibly and if I could ban binge drinbking I would
12But obviously that isnt gonna happen
12College frikkin students are too young to be boozing anyway
4What would chavs do on their stag nights? lol
/me crawls all over kyu
12Not attack people?
4Yeah but howcome you can go to war at 16 but can't drink til 18?
4Not that I mind
I don't see why you think being high will make you hit someone anyway.
12Because you don't just go straight to war
Probably 'cause training takes 2 years or so =P
It's more likely to make you lazy, and lethargic.
4Oh I know that it was just an example
12Um, Im not saying high = definitely attacking someone
What I love is how you can fly a plane at 16.
12I'm saying people DO actually do stupid things when they get high
4It just makes you giggle/sleep in fairness...
12Which is why it's stupid
4but some people then go on to stuff like heroine
They're more likely to jump off a building than hit someone when high.
4so I agree it should stay banned HERE

12Yes which is why it's stupid.. again
12Drugs are just becoming far too normal.
But that's their body.
4I suppose it's just this country because in Amsterdam no one 'experiments' with stuff as it's all legal anyway and so no one bothers.
12Look, I was walking to the station the other day and caught up with a group of frikkin druggy kids who were all smoking cannibis, I didnt want to have to walk past them and breathe that in
4they can't be bothered, like how drinking is legal in teen age in Spain and no one binge drinks
12But unfortunately I did, see how frikkin out of order that is?
I can't count on all my limbs the number of times drugs have been referenced in my high school 'cause it seemed "cool" or "funny".
4except the English
4I've never heard drugs referred to as 'cool'.
Heard it all the time here.
12yeh same.
I was offered a cigarette claiming it's "good for you".
4I have never had these experiences with people with drugs, sorry.
Which further proves how uneducated the public really is about these things.
12Right, when I was 15, the park I used to go to had different people in it every week and all took drugs pretty much all the time. So I've hd some pretty bad experiences
4Oh, I didn't know that.
12and yes I mean cannbis
What I don't get is how the kids get away with smoking drugs, in school.
They did at my sister's school.
4The teachers sell it to them
4lol
12Because it's becoming an acceptable thing now
On the field, in front of teachers.
To make a decision about whether to take drugs or not you need a proper assessment as to the effects of it on your development and ALL the affects it has.
4What about then...
12Society is just getting more and more relaxed on the dumbest things
I wouldn't say that, Arti, I still am surprised that they had to censor Left 4 Dead 2 >.>
4I think the word is tolerant
4but tolerance should be only about good things
12lol
This doesn't stop society running me through three criminal records checks and a medical records screening.
4if we went back to the Mary Whitehouse days I'd be sad
I think making it legal is good for the following reasons. Less money wasted stopping the sale, transport, and creation of the drugs, and that people will try the drugs anyway, whether they are banned or not.
I think MORE people will try it when it's legal.
Hence the problem.
I don't think so.
12Yeh obviously, if it becomes legal, everyone will consider it normal and take it the way they take alcohol.
Why not?
Because some people do it because it's illegal.
Alcohol needs a minimum price.
4Actually people ignore things and no longer consider them cool if they are legal
Like in parts of Canada.
People will START to do it 'cause it's illegal, but they'll KEEP doing it 'cause they're addicted.
They like being a 'rebel', a 'lawbreaker', they thinks it's cool.
12Thats rubbish. a tiny minority will do something because it's illegal
4it's reverse psychology
You'd be surprised.
4In Spain you don't get the local teenagers binge drinking because it's legal to drink from an earlier age
12More people nowadays don't even know they're illegal, now thats pathetic
07Hi all
4they don't consider it 'cool'
Smoking since it started was considered cool, and that was it's main marketing factor,.
4A lot of things are illegal just for the sake of it though like piracy
07Hm drug discussion?
Not because it's cool, I doubt.
Till they found out it caused a lot of problems in the body, and yet millions of people still smoke.
4In my school, you wanted to kill yourself if you smoked
And yes, it was because they thought it was cool.
4it was that simple
07that someone was paid to create
07so I can kinda see that having a reason
07But imo they're overfloofing on THAT...
The ciggarette adverts used to be a man wearing a leather jacket, standing in relaxed pose, smoking.
Tell me that is not being marketed as "cool".
Millions of people still smoke because they're hooked on it, not because they don't know.
Used to be.
It's illegal to advertise cigarettes in Canada anyway
Ack, all this talk about drugs >.<
12and the ones who start think it's a social thing :.
12*:/
12THAT is why it should NOT be made legal
It's an awful thing when unmoderated. As is everything.
It would be easier to moderate if legal.
It wouldn't be underground production, and sale.
What would you moderate then?
You could moderate what they put into it.
That's like Arti going, "No rules on IRC".
There's nothing LEFT to moderate
You wouldn't end up with camel crap holding the blocks of drugs together.
4lololol
Again, two different things.
07Okies back
In the above scenario Arti may as well be an ordinary member
4It's because of the bad people that people get tarred with the same brush I guess.
If you abolish all laws, then people can do whatever they want.
And the admin thing is just there to look flashy.
If all laws were abolished, I swear, the first thing I'd do is kill everything and everyone else.
4FISH
If you stop the sale of something being illegal, it's production, and marketing would no longer be hidden.
You can monitor it.
12In the dub of course
Mainly 'cause otherwise I would be killed first
4Oh Arti...have you hard that song that says 'big fish little fish'
4heard*
12LOL big fish little fish card board box?
Because the people producing it no longer have a need to hide it.
4I heard it in Hollywood Bowl
4yeah that one
07LOL Arrow
07What is the societys name with no laws?
12OMG is it really in hollywood bowl1?
07I know it has a name..
12I'll need to select the song some time HAHA
Anarchy.
07Ah
12Right listen to this guys
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJazHHcUlkg
07I knew the word looked like archery oo anyway
/me licks arti's link
07aesdfgkl
07*clicks
12Skip to 16mins past
4Arti it's on the machine in hollywood bowl!
12Er, seconds even Ovo
Drugs and smoking be damned, what I need more of is vespene gas
1216 seconds
07LOL!
So there is a HUGE different between making everying legal, and making one product legal.
12ITS HORRIBLE
4If we lose tolerance then we lose ourselves...random quote
07Arti, what -
Then I will construct additional pylons
@v@
07If you make one illegal product legal, then others might demand other things too
07and we'll have it going
12This is the absolute worst voice I've heard since Lucario's English dub voice
07Where will there be a line? anyway
07o.O
4Can anyone tell me how to hide a themed map that I don't want my mum finding out about haha! or should I just tell her it was only a laugh. It's NOT about drugs or BOOZE
Holy crap. That sounds like KEFKA.
07Anyway brb looking at arti's link
4I'm gonna put it in the bin at work
Frickin' KEFKA.
We've made things legal in the past.
4Like people burning
They didn't end up having to make more things legal.
"Destruction isn't supposed to be orderly, it's only fun when it's senseless!!" -Kefka, Final Fantasy VI
07Articuno god that voice is terrible
12This is SO pathetic..
12I want to hear the original voice now
07LOL Yeah I can see why arti
07that sounds terribly overdone...
It has never happened in the past.
So it wouldn't now.
07well prince dari, I know for a fact
07here in Norway when some people get a suggestion through
07others start demanding stuff too
07So one thing - people want more ...
In the UK politcians don't take ANY notice of what we want.
07I think some of the same might end up happening
So it doesn't matter.
07Lol
4What if we said 'higher taxes please!'
4then they would!
07Well it's not just about the UK =)
07LOL!!
We were talking about in the UK, so yeah.
Good thing I'm in Canada. =D
12Tony Blair did at the start
12:/
12But no comment about Gordie
07well I didnt know that you were talking about just the UK
07wasnt here at the start
Gordan Brown didn't really have a chance to do anything.
07LOL
12Crap I was meant to go half an hour ago, will need to go very soon.
07Articuno isnt that some weird language too?
07Meeps okies bird

02Stop using language you know you aren't supposed to damnit!
that was OLD
repeating
OLD
/me crawls all over kyu
02Your point being? You still used the language. The only reason I didn't see it earlier was because whatever you said there made me want to throw up
:o
Ovo?
02Same with that dam "lrn2internet" topic
??
/me hugs Kipi
:O
meaning
/me is a Shadow Lugia Ovo??

most of the admins are sensible and quite reasonable
cp

/me blinks and grins "heh heh heh, i like playing docter"

02FT? Gotta remember him....
but he's still fairly sensible
yah
02Ah yes! The battleboy

Their community likes battling
And our site is still better *runs*

I don't want it to be a TST copy

Not really, they are close to the same
General Grievous in the video looks mad, doesn't he?

Only a Greek philosipher could manage to die because a turtle fell from the sky and hit him on the head.
10wot?
A Greek philosipher died around 2000 year ago, because an eagle that had found a tortoise, dropped it on what it thought was a smooth rock (to crack it's shell), but was actually the philosipher's head.
It hit him on the head, and killed him.

6why do things have to be so hard :/
12hey Aurora, what's wrong?
6my journal
12ironically enough i was just about to check my messages
6I'm only here now because I'm doing homework online and I'm just not in the mood to be without company
I wished I could give you any additional support
6I know
/me huggles Aurora
if you should any idea - no matter what - just tell me freely
6thanks, but this is just one of those things that I have to do
6but now I'm worrying myself sick because I don't know what my dad is going to say tonight
If you don't mind me asking, what made you run away?
6just....go to a friend's and not come home for two nights...
if you want to take some time off, you're welcome to get over here :)
6oh yeah, that'll help
6dari, a conflicting issue I've decided on and my parents don't agree with
Oh.
6yeah
/me limps in pain x.x
03Apparently while I was sleeping I pulled a muscle in my leg
6whats wrong?
6ugh
03Yeah
03and I got a class in like two hours
6that stinks
03:O
03Microsoft is giving a speech at my school tonight?
03It IS just them showing off Windows 7 but LOL, it's the thought that counts
I had such a pain too several times before drf
seems like you had a cramp when you slept. That's the pain you're feeling now
03hm
03how long does it last? x.x
will fade over the day
03oh
03I'll probably just take the bus down to class, I'm not gonna walk 15 minutes like this
understandable
6I woke up with a bad cramp and I thought I had appendicitis >_<
6but like, I couldn't move for half an hour
6and then it went away
6it was weird
03appendicitis?
03I wouldn't even know what that feels like LOL
6neither would I
hey
03heh
6but it was in the right location of the body
03well I broke my wrist once, and I had no idea what happened
hy
6I think I might have actually broken it
03LOL
03If it were broken you WOULD know, as I was like physically incapable of moving it
03it hurt too much to not keep it still
03of course the people at the hospital didn't help >_> they went to get X-rays and started bending it so it would fit under the camera
03I was like OW THAT HURTS YOU IDIOT
6drf, I couldn't move it
03and you didn't do anything about it?
6I didn't go to the hospital though
6nope
03LOL way to got
03-t
6I hate hospitals
how are you \?
03why?
03I only hated having to wait like 5 hours before they'd see me x.x
6I'm very uncomfortable in them
6dunno why
03since I wasn't dying they just kinda ignored me
03but that's Beaumont for you
6fear of shots, fear of just being in there
03o.o
03Shots are nothing LOL
6for me they are
03I got one a year or so ago and I was like "... that was it? Oh."
03but that could be because I have so much fat on my arms it blankets my veins
6my doctor comes with one to two extra nurses because she knows I'm going to be a pain to give shots to
/me runs
6the nurses wind up having to restrain me :/
03heh
03it's like how some people are irrationally scared of dentists >_>
03Generally if they're there to help I'm not scared...
6I'm scared of the sharp instruments being proddes into my mouth
6prodded
When I got burnt, the doctor decided that it was a good idea to just it was just a good idea to rip my thumb from the side of my hand, where the skin was sort of melded together.
Surely there had to have been a better way to separate them. o_o
03Heh
03GOOOOOOOOD I'm about ready to throw Microsoft Office 2007 and the whole PPTX file format off a cliff
03I spent a fricking hour yesterday "Fixing" a PowerPOint that someone in my chemistry group made
03and now looks like I gotta do it again >_>
12get openoffice drf
12or is open source above you?
12:P
03I have it
03OOo fails too
03Office 2007 is just plain retarted
03*retarded
03like
12abiword?
03if you open it in there
03all the graphs are messed up
03...PowerPoint, not Word
03documents always work fine LOL
12oh
12abipowerpoint? 8D
6PPTX is just aplain fail
03wtf?
03Yeah
03well the thing is
6we deal with it all the time in speech class
03they saved it as PPT
03but it has these graphs from Excel
6oh
03unlike in earlier versions where it just copied the f'ing graph
03it made it as a link
6ew
03and you can't do it properly without having the XLS file too
03Yeah
03so my only fix was to copy it into Paint and copy it back as a picture >_>
6 2003 was such a nice program
03Same with that stupid shadow text crap they call WordArt now
03Yeah I knoiw
6why "fix" it
03*know
03I've got 2000, 2007, and 2010 on here
032000 still owns all of them LOL
I can just copy-paste graphs into powerpoint. O_o
6dunno if I've used 2000
From excel.
And I have 2007.
It works fine for me. :o
03It'll whine at you saying you can't do it
Why isn't it saved as a .pptx?
03EW PPTX
Lol.
03Why would ANYONE want to save ANYTHING as PPX?
03ït's like PPT on steroids
03LOL office 2010 failure
Because that's powerpoint 2007 version extension.
03"This file came from the Internet and has been locked"
03I made the f'ing thing myself, kthx
6._.
03You just go into settings and tell it to save as PPT
03there's really no advantage to PPTX
But then the old and new versions use the same extension, which probably why it's screwed up.
03It's like, Microsoft added two things and they're all "Oh, we should make a new format, rather than just making this compatible out of the box"
03Like that shadow-text crap
03it's the same as WordArt
03they just chose to make it incompatible
It thinks it's an old version file, when you open it in the old office, but it's formatted like the new powerpoint type.
03because they're stupid./
So it screws up.
03If you save it as PPT it should be in compatibility mode already
03but apparently this guy didn't do it that way
Hm.
Ok, fail.
BRB, gunna get something to eat.
03and ugh formatting

I suppose having your legs slowly crushed over a period of 2 hours, and then having your organs eaten by maggots would also be bad.
>_< now they are gonna charge an arm and a leg if they fix it!

90% of artists are unhappy with their art. 100% of passionate artists are unhappy with their art.
I'd assume that's because you always have room to improve?
Of course. :p
Did you know Leonardo Da Vinci hated a lot of his own art? He hated it so much, that he rufused to finish several pieces of art because he didn't think they were gonna be absolutely perfect.
03Good artists draw. Great artists steal
/me runs
It's a random comment because most artists complain about imperections that most people look over and would kill to have the level of skill the artist has.

6but apparently they made one for GS, RSE, and the RBY remakes
03yeah, I had a lame attempt at making a full length clean version
03since the normal one fades out way early
howdy
How are ya?
well...that was five hours ago. I'm finally done with it...and Magix is transcoding the movie files right now
Ah
03o.o magix?
yeah, video deluxe 2008 plus
03ew all in one converters
as long as it works, I'm fine with it
03I do all my encoding by hand LOL
:D
I'm gonna chill out and eat now, might pop on later
03an TMPGEnc FTW
kk cya Arti!
03Yes.
03DS download station
6is it wifi in the building, or do you-
6oh
03Yeah
12got any ozzy music now?
128D
and WHY should I make my life even harder just so I can use as many programs as possible, eh?
03you just take your DS and search for wireless event
03Better quality? :P
6awesome
you need to learn A LOT about time and money efficiency
03who said anything about money? LOL
03Anyway. I'm busy trying to figure out how to output some stuff in C++
I'm an IT specialist and soon I'll be a service manager for a whole service center - each extra hour I need to work costs me around 120 euros. As long as the product is not worth the additional work, I don't do it
03That's why encoding in the background FTW?
03I always just start the thing before I go to bed at night
03I wake up and it's done
03problem solved
I'm not just encoding, this is a combination that has been cut, added with music and stuff
03oh, well I use Corel for that
03I thought you mean you ewre using a one-click converter
you use COREL for video editing?
03Yes?
03Corel VideoStudio
03best thing ever
for an one-and-a-half-hour movie with music and stuff?
03Yeah, why?
/me facepalms
6pfth
03It's better than Windows Movie Ruiner and Adobe Premiere Bloat
6*shows
03LOL
03Because it's top-secret >:O
03Nah, I dunno
6lol
well, yeah, I know there're also hackers just taking ECHO for programming...
6well, I have to make that drive anways, but I still hope it's there
03Heh
03I gotta take a bus
03and it's like a 53 minute ride with transfers >_>
why take a bus?
6I gotta drive >:O
just walk
or - build your own bus!
03because I can't walk like 5-6 miles?
03that takes LONGER
6it's a 40 minute drive
03LOL, driving ftw
03I'd be fine with that
03I mean, buses ftw too
6eh
You could cycle 5-6 miles.
03I'm just saying it's such a long ride for what it's worth
03I don't have a bike here
Oh.
6I'm bringing my music, because our radios are here are notorious for going on commercial AT THE SAME TIME
03LOL
6or playing cruddy songs at the same time
TV programs do that.
03Zune + Casette adapter + my mom's van's tape deck = WIN
All go to adverts at the same time.
03also, being dangerous by changing the song while you're driving FTW?
6I'm not kidding, there was this time where 4 of my stations played one of my LEAST favorite songs within 10 seconds of each other...so I just turned the radio off
6LOLyes
6hmm
6I should probably get ready to go now I guess
6the heck? "water found on moon"
eh?
6http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/science/14moon.html?_r=1&hp&emc=na
I'm guessing it means 'ice'
03yeah, someone left the hose on
/me runs
The Ipod touch has to be the only good thing apple has ever made.
I wanna get over 9000 plushies!
/me brick'd
6ew WHAT?
03EW IPODS
03the Zune HD is SO better than iPod Touch :?P
03-?
Why is that?
Justify yourself. :P
03because it's not an iPod?
/me hides
03but really
03It has a radio, first of all
03AND HD Radio
03better screen resolution
why do you buy such a player drf? just SING yourself :)
03it can play HD, as the name says, with a dock
I'm fairly sure "There's an app for that"
03EW INTERNET RADIO
I mean - it's so much better and cheaper and easier
03Plus those apps requrie Wi-Fi
03*require
6I had google map directions for toys r us to my house, and it was 40 minutes. I switched the two so it was my house to toys r us, and it's 50 minutes now .-.
03LOl
03Just drive backwards on the one way streets, problem solved :)
6LOL
reminds me: Someone wanted to drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas with the help of Google Maps...
well, if he had trusted the program, he would have needed four weeks...
I don't listen to the radio much anyway.
...because the program implanted around 2100 U-turns into the route^^
I'll only do that if in the car, in which case I have the car radio.
03Heh
6there used to be a glitch in the google maps program
6where if you imput directions from new york to london
6it would have had you drive through the atlantic
Anyway, if you do have an Ipod touch, you get to scam apple out of their overpriced, and pointless applictions. :)
/me chews on a carrot
03yeah whatever, I think apps are stupid
03I mean, 99% of them
can you imagine a Lugia chewing on a carrot?
03Games, fine
03but the "Fart button" app, completely pointless
6lol
03Zune HD has games, wtf else would you need?
03and it's mainly the not-being-an-iPod part that makes it better :P
I dunno what the Zune looks like, so I don't know what the games are like.
:P
How much memory does it have?
i used to eat so many carrots when i was a kid that the corners of my mouth were orange
03there's a 16GB and 32GB
Ahh, cool.
urgh^^
03DANG IT C++
Nice.
03That OVERWROTE the text
go ahead with C# drf ;)
03I want something will output to a text file, but put each line on top of the file >_>
03...
03my class is in C++
03I can't just change it >_>
Can't you specify a line for it to output onto, but have it as a variable, that increases each time it's run, or something.
03Not really
03I mean, ordinarily yes, but the program we have to write is harder than that
03whatever, I'll get ready to go to Toys R Us now LOL
6same
6by everyone, be back in a few hours
6bye
6fdoigd
/me cuddles Roara
bye you
12hmm
gah, WHY the hell does the program only use ONE of my FOUR processor kernels entirely, eh?
Because it has a low priority, so it's only allowed access to one? O_o
I dunno. XD
I've changed the priority to real-time
Hm.
O_o
I have no idea.
that's the highest priority you can set
say speaking of 9000. that was said in starfox 64
03depends how old they are
03and ... I've always had better luck with "high" than "realtime", dunno why
well, high seems to work for me right now
03that's my point LOL
03I dunno what realtime does but it seems to make it go SLOWER
12i wonder when i'm going to finally stop coughing up stuff
eh?
When there's nothing left to cough up.
03XD
12good answer
Lol.
XD
Hey, drf. What does your program output anyway?
03Um
03Basically, ASCII maps.
Oh right.
03it's this super complicated thing we're making LOL
03I asked on the class forums about it, hopefully someone will have some insight
Does each output have to be in the same text file?
03Yes ;/
03and each newer one has to go on top
03which is the problem
03otherwisre I'd just keep outputting and it would go on bottom
Hm.
03anyway, i gotta make a bus
03bbl

Well, people are entitled to their own opinions, so I consider there to be mant exceptions.

I'm going through my datasheet collection... just found the wireing instructions for one of the old 5MB reel-to-reel tape drives.
Wow.
Bah... actually it isn't quite that old.
It only goes as far back as the early 80s. IBM was already on cartidges by then.
And wireing instructions for the Euromod system, whatever that is.
This datasheet section it titled 'hardened nipples.' :>
And details for wireing what looks like every type of domestic phone connector in use in the UK, and quite a few non-domestic.
And a list of chemicals prohibited under the montreal protocol.

7FLEE TO THE HILLS. CLIMB INTO THE EYES.
I wanna go there TwT
XD
>_> not funny after having water levels here raise like 8 feet
7Not funny because you don't get a joke. Better topics than that have attempted to guilt me before, and all have failed.
7not a joke. the joke.
You know that ball game I made a loooooooooooooooooooong time ago?
Is the joke
like
/me yawns
The Game
:D
7...
7I hate you.
D:
7Dari@ wut?
/me cackles maniacally
I updated it so it actually works better, and it's alright now.
05I used to live really close to there. XD
Levels before the boss are exceedingly boring though.
05Then I moved halfway across the country. >w>
7ball game?
7I don't remember that
/me dies a spectacularly dramatized and influential death
You know, where the balls followed you.
<.< That's what she said
Although they all objected. :P
XD
Oh yeah, I remember that XDD
7I never played that game. I remember you discussing it and you being kicked many times.
Wasn't I going to be Pikachu or something?
You were going to have a pikachu.
Lol.
I made the boss a circle instead. :P
Haha
>:
05It's a great aquarium. 8D
12i always have lived in wisconsin :/
05I went once when they had the great white shark and stuff. 83 It was neat~
owo
Owo
owO
-w-
7..Not this again.
o.o
._.
._______.
7You guys are ALL weirdos.
Glad ya noticed :D
Why thank you owo
02Same Glacy
02And hi Quil
I wanna swim with dolphins T.T
07lol
07my sister did that once o3o
Dolphins are evil.
Rule #4 Don't blend in. Be different and be proud of it.
hi.
What's rule #1?
):
07hai
why you got bit by one? lol
Do not talk about /b/
6o3o
Oh, they look really cute, and some of them are friendly...
lol
You just broke the rule! D: :P
No, these are my rules for life XD
But they have been known to be very violent at times.
I also broke rule #2 D:
6dolphins are territorial
Lol.
Very.
O_o
12sounds promising
4Giggity?
^ Lol
6lol
No ._.
but they are known to protect humans from sharks though. sharks seem to be afraid of them
6this is true, but it doesn't change that dolphins can do what they want
That guy scares me >.>
6don't expect one to save you, it might not be in their mndset
6mindset
4he's fake
6don't get me wrong though, I love dolphins
They are also over-sexed, and have been observed killing other dolphins - often killing the offspring of a female in order to free her up for mateing w ith.
me too
Even killing dolphins of other species, even though there is no competition for food... they just do it *because it's fun*.
Well yeah :P
12nice roara :)
6o3o
/me pokes DA pic
So yeah
I'm like
Leaching internet :D
sounds like the dolphins in japan and Faroe Islands being hunted >.>
02It's Apollo :O
7Better than people being in love with one. Let's all take a moment's silence to remember Twitards, and then go troll the shit out of them.
4lol
Well you know what, at least I'm not in love with fictional characters like half the Spyro fandom
OKAY 8D
and nice panting, Roara =3
/me pads off with a large club

6thanks

4My friends and I were gonna go see New Moon and annoy the fuck out of the fangirls

Hah, Twitards must have gotten to it
So much for wikipedia not being biased
4yeah
02That looks fun 030
4and the last book was supposed to be negative
4and now it is mixed
4lawl
Well some people did love it
NuttyMadam3575 comes to mind
4oh

6it does 8D
4did I tell you people about the time I burned a book in front of 10 fans?
07whee
LOL
No
Nice.
02Idk why, but it reminds me of Pokemon Stadium (not the game, just the graphics)
XD
12kyu XD
12that's funny
4found the book in the trash
4so I was lik e'hmm...'

07lol
I met a Twilight fanboy a couple days ago <.<
ewwwwww
I know D:
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
._.
02It also reminds me of Pokemon Channel LOL
4I have one at my school
ohgod

KILL IT WITH FIRE D:
4and he is in 4 out of 6 classes
4-.-
7BURN THE HEATHEN.
7CLEANSE THEIR SOULS WITH FLAME.
4although
Hello!
I started talking about how Edward stalking her is super creepy and he just said
6Kyu
4nobody fucking likes him except the twitard fangirl
12magic is awesome dude
6and I was like NO WAY I DID TOO
6o3o
"It's because he loves her!"
07lol
6you sketched my design for him, or one of your own?
What is everyone talking about?
4I shall now call Twilight 'Toilet'
7How much twilight sucks.
07yours lol
7Toilight.
It does.
07now for Tomai o3o
I just hope New Moon doesn't.
That response is so canned and overused by delusional fangirls I couldn't believe someone actuallly used it
It does
12o.o
It's worse
I've read the book
All of them
6o3o
Doesn't mean the movie is bad...
6JIF peanut butter <3
Although New Moon is nothing compared to the epic fail that is Breaking Dawn
4Edward Cullen is in it
4of coruse it sucks
Yeah it does, if they follow the plot
4and Bella
Or lack thereof
JELLY TIME!! =D
6every generation this recipie gets passed down, something gets fixed in some small way
/me brick'd
"EDWARD LEFT ME BAWWWWW"
4the most sueish characters of the literacy world
6my edit to this recipe is using only JIF
4I saw that in the trailers!
4and I cracked up
07lol Roara
For half the book
6you can't use anything else without getting different results o3o
07for like what, 3 generations? o3o
12put kyu in the recipe
02Next time use actuall peanuts
02Hey Lyon
what about skippy? o3o
4and something like 'Some will rise to defend her...' and I am like 'they just want to get laid'
04Hey Shiny, Kyu, Beto
Then "OMG I can hear his voice in my head if I do stupid things! I should jump off a cliff! :D"
04And Umbreon
07hi Lyon, Lyon, Lyon
07o3o
07and Lyon
12hi
I think when writing the book, she must have been limited to a vocabulary of about 50 words.
6kyu, dunno
6I thought it was 4
6I think
6pretty sure
07but it's probably 2
/me runs
6loooooooooool
04Hey Roara
Nah, Stephenie Meyer rapes the thesaurus
Granite, granite, smoldering, granite, love, granite, smoldering, love, smoldering.
Chagrin
LOL
There's another book she wrote, that's apparently really good o.o I can't remember the name, but my friend told me about it
"verbose"
6hiya o3o
02That's right, it's Saturday over there
How many times did she repeat granite and smoldering?
02I'm gettin my time zones confused again x.x
My GOD.
6oh right
4I know JK has some repetitive things
6I gotta hide the JIF in my room
"broodingly"
7and chagrin. I physically cringed when that came up in a Terry Brooks novel.
4but unlike Twilight, Pothead is good
07lolwhy
6my brothers will eat it >_<
02I gotta better hiding place...
07XD
6my family doesn't buy JIF
04lol
Words like that that no one ever uses and don't even make sense in the context she uses them in
6they get skippy, which sucks
04It's Saturday here as well
4yeah
02I just said that Lyon
Meyer just uses big words so her book will sound OMG SMRT LOL
04Oh
07moms like yours don't choose JIF?!
I wrote a sentence of words no one uses/ understands.
/me shot
I'll see if I can find it.
6my mom does :P
6my stepmom doens't
04I thought you said it's Saturday over There
6she chooses the cheaper kind o3o
04My mistake
7I think we scared Malefor with actual intelligent conversation
4I have basic words with some figurative language thrown in at times. I only did that so that the readers wouldn't be like 'wtf'
XD
/me yawns
02Kk
04Shiny
Biggest sentence ever o.o In the book "The Scarlet Letter"
It's like
04You heard of Klonoa 2?
half a page long D:
Eww, I hated that book
02No, what is it?
Ever heard of runon sentences? >_>
I came up with my own horror stories called Killer Thrillers...
04It's a PS2 game
04I don't have it, just wondering if you heard of it
Yes, and I did that once... It was very stupid.
It's like ".....seriously."
02I don't pay attention to PS2 games, coz I don't have one
7Target Acquired. Loading pwn bullets, eating awesome sandwich.
4haha
xd
You guys are going to go troll them?
12hmm
7Hells yeah.
4If I have time
02Btw, Lyon, can I PM you?
4never know when someone will barge down the door
I think this goes without saying, but don't mention Spyroforum or Spyrochat EVAR
4duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
I think I might do some stuff
like
fun
and such
You should go spam on 4chan, pretending to be twitards, lol.
XD
How many of those words do you not know?
:P
Most of them o.o
04Sure
grambog is the only word that isn't real.
triskaidekaphobia is the phobia of the number 13.
Esurient, and triskaidekaphobiac
Ah
Now only Esurient I don't know o.o
Heheheh
/me is a neeeeeerd
I used as many obscure words as possible. :)

Hi Arrow! *waves*
I just got Dissidia
07Rah
07Yes Arrow I am
07brb
/me pounces on Okan and snuggles
/me is hugged and floofs her fur in reaction
/me 6floofs in her general direction
Hi Aurora! ^^ *waves*
10Floof like a tidal wave.
6indeed
LOL XD
Hi from an iPhone
03EW IPHONES
02I read that as "Hold the Phione"
/me uses Confuse Ray on Okan
/me hits himself in confusion
LOL XD Sorry. I'm starting to feel more like a Ninetales these days.
6lol
10o3o
6ggotta go for now
6bye
10bye
10also o3o
Oh! My mom bought me 2 new $80.00 dresses that were on clearance for $.96
03LOL
02Lol "We're having a sale, everything's 98% off!"
10lolwow
Maybe they're only *worth* $20, and were just hugely overpriced.
ROFL XD Still, I'm going to wear one of my dresses on my first date with my mate when I meet him in person someday.
03o_O
03Long distance relationships fail
What? O.o
03Not that I've ever had one
03but I've seen a lot of them fall apart
/me smacks drf with a trout
12yeah
Even if I'm in a long-distance relationship, I'm happy with it since it's been going on for close to 4 years.
/me slaps drf with a trout
I just realized...less than one week now
03o.o
03free trout
03nice
howdy :)
Ack! OvO I'll brb. I left my DS on.
/me comes back and snuggles her Lugia Plushie
since around 2000
Wow! OvO I guess I'm not the only one who has liked that magnificent birdy for that long. ^v^
I've loved Lugia since I saw it the first time in winter 1999
within a japanese trailer
The japanese trailer for Revelation Lugia? O.o
downloaded from a ratio ftp....through my 56k modem
yeah
Cool. ^^ It also seems like I'm not the only one searching for the Giant Lugia Plushie. I've been looking for it for close to 8 years now.
All I have is a giant parrot plushie.
I was close to buying it from the official page. I didn't have sufficient money in those days. Now I have...but there're few to no chances to get one
05I have a giant ostrich plushie. o_o
02I have a pterodactyl plushie
Even if I don't have a large amount of Lugia plushies, I'm happy with the one I have. ^^
03you know people at Nintendo?
sure
03can you, like, find out the DSi or Wii common key?
/me runs
I fear neither are they able nor would they be allowed to deliver that information to a random person on the net drf :P
03LOL
03I wish more people knew about the bruteforcing app this guy wrote >_>
03I should go download it again, and leave it running
/me hopes she gets to go to a TST meet someday
who thinks giant lugia's actual value is less than 5 grand? XD
02Hiya Slash
hi!
Ugh! I hope I get my new computer soon. I want to draw more Lugia art on Photoshop.
at least you're able to
I wished I could in fact
02Draw Lugia?
02I can't get anything drawn right w/ Lugia
everything's better than what I'm not able to
02I fail ;v;
04^I am the same
04I CANNOT draw lugia
04>.<;
02Well, I can't draw at all
that's because I used a simple mechanical model
Hmmmm, I could use my 12" Talking Lugia figurine for reference. O.o Perhaps that could help.
02Or go on Google and type "Lugia" I'm sure you'll get thousands of pictures in different positions to help
04Shiny >.>
04You draw better than me, that's for sure
02What?
Thanks for the tip, Okan. ^^
well, I used a very simple mechanic for reference. Yet I have problems with every other perspective then plainly looking at it from the side or front
02Well, you'll be gettin better than me soon Lyon, you already are
For me, I'm still learning how to draw Ninetales. I want to make an ID of my Articuno/Ninetales Hybrid.
04Well Shiny, I don't plan on getting better
04I draw for amusement
12I want to make an ID of my Articuno/Ninetales Hybrid.
12NINENINE :D
04The only real art form I excel at is Spriting
12oh Articuno
LOL XD My PokeSona is a Ninetales with the headcrest and wings of an Articuno.
02It's still art and you're still drawin, just mini
the good thing: I think I found the perfect facts sheet on how Lugia's wing anatomy works. Therefore I can quite well calculate and explain the wingspan
04You couldn't call it drawing
04ovo
04I continue to surprise myself
04This Lunaria sprite is coming out WAY better than I thought
knowing all the anatomical facts, it's a pain in the b. when I see so obvious mistakes...
One thing that I find odd is when Lugia's wings are drawn with only 4 "fingers" O.o It's supposed to have five on each wing if I'm not mistaken.
024 plus "thumb"
correct
the thumb is below - as the wing's in fact a real hand
the whole wing is built up like your arm in fact. Only the "hand" joint is a bit different
link?^^
/me watches Sskirei
LOL XD It's okay, Okan. ^^
hrrm - the wing seems to be a bit short - and a Lugia wouldn't stand flat on its heels - only if its belly is almost entirely touching the ground
^^
always welcome
02Now you can see my failart D:
02It's Primal Lugia *flees*
when it comes to Lugia's legs: They're similar constructed like the hindlegs of dogs or cats. Not the same, but similar. They don't go as steep like dog's legs, but enough so they get sufficient buffering force
eh...?
thanks anyways
02Sorry bout the bad joke x.x
Okan, your art doesn't fail. ^^ It's cute.
well, just wondering what should be so primal about me?
04Well, you have a glowing pattern on your back, like Primal Dialga
04And you are a darker colour than normal
02What Lyon said
04=D
02Exactly XD
first - I'm darker because my father was a dark Lugia and my mother a pure one
second - the pattern on my back is the source of my temporal abilities. Artificially implanted when I was younger
you could also have it if you wanted. Yet you would die due to the implantation pain if your body wasn't in total stasis and your soul ripped out of your body
I don't think I could survive something like that. O.o
and even then the energies require a body resistant enough to stand the most powerful whirls and streams of time, space and the fifth dimension
02No need to insult me there >.>
nobody's insulting you. I'm just explaining
gah! Damn it! I need a new battery and a new cable for this laptop -v-
well...not really. Time is an element of mine. I'm part of time and can move through it
O_O
ME TOO!
/me runs
guys NASA discovered water on the moon.
Noooooo!
and there is where I go, "So?"
we have water here!
I knew that since...erm...september?
we're better off in the earth's cousin!
I guess Ice and Fire would be my elements. O.o I was a Vulpix that was born on December 18th. But I evolved to a Ninetales on my 18th birthday.
05Having water on the moon is one of crucial things required with making a moonbase. :|
indeed
05'cause it'd be impossible to ship water from the earth to the moon, and water can be used to power stuff.
02Because we overpopulated the earth and fear global warming
My element is surprise!
I killed the chat 3:
No you didn't. X3 I'm still here.
02Sorry, I'm drawing more...art...?
so am I xD
02I guess if you can even call it that >.>
bah! Stupid cable!
04D:
02Hey Pokestar (late, sorry)
04Its fine, I just finished checking your DA.. again XD
02I haven't uploaded it there yet, my new art: http://i34.tinypic.com/e0hcsl.jpg
04It's cute, it looks like it has a floofy tail :O
02It's supposed to XD
04Floofy! :D
/me floofs her 9 tails and uses Confuse Ray on Okan again
02"I'm so sane, it's driving me crazy"
02LOL
/me attacks a tree out of confusion
Someday, I'll get another DSi. That way, I can take photos again. ^^
/me eats the attacked tree
/me floofs
02Feels like I'm fallin for the first time
^w^
I guess the reason why I'm an Ice/Fire elemental Ninetales is that I was born in the winter, but both of my Zodiac signs are Fire Elemental.
02Quan!
02Guess what I got from the library
7Haaaaaaaai!
7o3o
7To Kill a Mockingbird?
/me pulls out Kingdom Hearts manga
02Na, we're reading that in English soon
04Lol, that was at my Book fair yesterday Dx
7LE GASP
7Wait, which version, Okan: regular, CoM, 2, or 358?
02Regular
02I've already read the first volume of 2
04Bah
04Sorry
7Heya, Lyon. :3
04Hey Lyon
02Hey Lyon
/me 7pokes SN
04I had to clean up the backyard- Ohai Quan
/me plans to play Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days again soon.
7Hmm, we have an SN and an NS.
04SN?
04oic
02lol
7Again? o3o
04You inspired me to try and sprite GRoyvle from PMD 2 Dx
04Who did PS?
7Wait, are you SA? o3o
Yep, Yep. ^^
7Ah.
/me 7didn't know you were a KH fan. o.O
/me pokes Lyon
well, I'm in bed now...
02cya
/me hugs back
thanks. I'll let my computer running...and still encoding
/me will brb
7Icy, you still--D:
04Yes PS?
04I was answering your question. You were the one who inspired me. :O
04Oh
04How?
7No, that's not exactly what I meant. X3
7But now I've forgotten what I was saying when I said that. o3o
lol
LOL XD
04I really don't know know, you just did, Lyon Dx
Mostly the storyline and the characters. ^^
02That's why I'm reading the manga LOL
04KIIIIGNDOM HEEEEEAEAAAARTS!
/me flees
7o3o
/me 7pokes this to #kingdom_hearts and flees
04Nah
02Coz usually I only play for stories, and since I don't have PS2, well...
/me uses Will-O-Wisp on Lyon
04I just wanted to burst something out
/me dodges
LOL XD
/me 7uses Firaga on Lyon o3o
02Lyon, I signed up btw
/me hasn't refreshed
02Sorry
7o3o
7What about 358/2; how's that for you?
I already finished it and it was awesome, but sad.
04K
04I know Shiny
04I approved you
02I saw
04K
02That's why I said sorry >.>
02I might watch 358/2 on YT to see what the story is
/me listens to the battle music of Primal Dialga
04Hey guys! Especially you Quan
04The Dragon RP sprites so far
04http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp98/FireEmblemFanEX/DragonRPPixelArt-6.png
04From the left: Lunaria, Fiora, Kyu, and Drake
04What do you think?
/me tries to whistle the Primal Dialga battle theme, but ends up spitting fire embers
7o_O
02wb
7Thanks.
02And it's cool, Lyon...
04Thanks Shiny
04Quan
04http://i401.photobucket.com/albums/pp98/FireEmblemFanEX/DragonRPPixelArt-6.png
/me sighs
04Dragon RP sprites
02I wanted to join that, but I don't think they would've wanted me there
04They are nice, Lyon :3
04Thanks PS
04And why wouldn't they want you Shiny?
02Why would they?
/me 7blinks
Awesome sprites, Lyon. ^^
7Lunaria --> Lumaria.
7LOL.
04You are an awesome friend, good Rper, great drawer
04And thanks IN
7Drawer = storage object. Artist = One who makes art.
7Lyon, the first sprite seems really nicely done.
02I don't think most people there like me anyways. I'm not a good drawer, and me quitting 2 RPs and making them fail shows my RPing skills pretty well >.>
/me has a team of Vulpix/Bulbasaur in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky
04Thanks
/me is getting angry
7Though, you'll have to look at proportion for the others.
7O.o
7Why?
04Shiny
04WHY THE HELL are you so pessimistic?
7...
7Lyon...?
/me recently downloaded Paper Mario to her Wii
7It's because of condescending comments like that that lower people's optimism.
04Well, I see no reason for Shiny to be down in the first place!
04He has great friends, and whatever he says he is a great artist!
04I'm sorry if I'm mad, but you have no reason to be feeling down!
12just like the commercial :D
Ack! X3 I g2g. I was planning to watch a walkthrough of Paper Mario.
04But fine Shiny.
04If you want to be pessimistic, go ahead
04I won't stop you
02What do you WANT me to say about myself?
7My, my, my...
7Both of you, shut it.
12so how is everyone?
12i haven't been very active with everything that has gone on
7I'm fine, thank you. :)
02...
hello?
7Hai.
hi!
04hey
hi to you to ^6
^^
02brb, I need to eat

12:(
02lol
02looooool
02haaaai
/me points to the topic
02I know LOL
02Apparently you DON'T
02heh
02joking around is fuuuun ;D
02That's ENOUGH
02k
02:3
02lol
/me yawns
02You're just trying to piss me off, huh?
02I am?
02no I'm not
hi QUAN!
/me glomps
02I was only pointing out I was joking, that's all
7AERO
02also
7Haaaaaaaaaaaaaai.
hiya!
02NS, it's a CHILDREN'S site and chat!
02k
02You think it's funny, but it makes me infuriated
02STOP IT!
02wb Quan...
7Hey, Okan. :)
/me 7hugs Okan
hey Shiny!
/me hugs back
02Hey Slash
02Alright, alright.
=)
02o-o
02hey Quan
7Hey, NS.
02^^
7I experimented with 358/2's multiplayer;
02that also reminds me to go on Trap17 D:
how is it?
that fails
7On the other hand, Zexion's is awesome. o3o
02lol Really, Quan?
02Xemnas' is a pain
7Ah, one of the reasons I'm indifferent with him.
02but it's hard to control
02well
02you HAVE no control over it
02D:
7Lulz.
7Try controlling Saix's.
02LOL
02nah
02and if the enemies move out
02yeah
04Hey NS
7Saix is powerful enough even without his limit. :3
02hey Drake
02yeah that's true
02I love Riku's limit though :D
04Wb Lyon
04ty
7Marly's is kewl. o3o
02lol Marluxia's
02I rarely use him :D
02For some reason, in Multiplayer
7o3o
02Enemies' levels are increased
02and attacks don't do a lot of damage D:
04Obvious why
02lol
04You're meant to work together
04NS
7I actually barely survived <spoiler> the first try against <spoiler>.
04If-I mean when- I get Days, wanna do multiplayer?
02eh?
7It doesn't have wi-fi, Lyon. D:
02yeah
02it doesn't
04D=
04No way
02I thought it did...
02I'm currently modding the hell out of the rom LOL
04Shiny
04PM?
02Sure
02xD
02heh
7Mrr, everyone wishes for that capability, eh?
02how many of you have a R4 or similar?
7Unless there's some 358/2 Days:FM...
02yeah...
04I might be getting an R4
7Which would probably never get exported overseas.
02doubt it though
02eh
02I'd pirate it
02as usual
/me has an R4
02:D
7But still, it'd be in Japanese.
02get one, Drake
02eh
04I probably will
02I finished the jap game easily :D
04My cousin did
02lol
04And I really want one
02Then I can give you my modded version
02of the game :D
02I'm trying to get it to be able to use wi-fi
7NS, I thought you said you had a hard time beating the Leechgrave?
02difficult...D:
02YES I DID
02YES
7What about Dustflier? :P
02And The Ruler Of The Sky as well
04Leechgrave?
02which one was Dustflier?
02Oh don't worry
7The seventh giant heartless.
02We don't want to spoil it :D
02lolthat?
7The Wyvern-like one?
02Not too hard
7It was a looooooooooong battle. o3o
02I finished it off fairly quickly
02so yea
04Dustflier already sounds awesome
02eh
02it's not
02it's a big pain in the butt
7It's tough if you don't know the heartless's pattern.
02lol
02Emerald Serenade -_-
02I haaaaaaaate them D:
07o3o
02and the Novashadow mission is so annoying
7Ohai, Kyu.
02and hi Kyu
04KYU
/me glompz
7The Novashadow one? Naw.
7Just a bit more puzzle-like.
7BTW, do you have 100% completion in 358?
02xD
02no
02no
02no
04lol
02I cbb
02I've been playing 5Ds Yugioh lately LOL
7Ahrmm?
04Sora isn't worth it right?
02I love my new dark deck :D
02yes he isn't
/me runs
7Sora's a pretty strong character, actually.
02I need Mickey though D:
02yeah Sora is
02but he's hard to get
02really hard
02):
02also Ultima Weapon is awesome
7extremely*
02xD
7What missions don't you have 100% in?
7The sigil ones? o3o
04D=
07aside from MOST OF THEM?
/me hides
04Everyone talking about Days makes me want it more
7Lulz, Kyu.
7I actually complete what I can of missions first time around.
02laggggggy internet
7Dang mission 62...
02lol
04lol
04ironic
bye all
04it hits you iron hard
7Bye, Aero. o3o
/me flees
04Bai Aero
7Luxord's limit break is fun, even if it has a chance of not working. X3
02lol
/me snugs
12:)
04What is Luxord's limit break?
7It fits his gambling nature; a card appears in front of the enemy you're attacking, and it flickers between symbols. Choose the right one, and it deals a large amount of damage. If not, it doesn't. o3o
04Ah
04I see
04That fits Luxord
02I read that as "Alucard"
02o-o

Nomming home-made tortillas
take it off then D:
no, he warm
now he's on my lap
xD k
anyway
do you know what a kline or gline is?
I see
I'm not exactly a fan of mexican ^_^;;
no
well
a kline is a server ban
like, a ban from the local server
a gline is a ban from the network
I see
like a global server ban
I should really try salsa dips
so
kline would ban you just from here
If I klined you right now
meaning from Altair's server, hoohrealm.dynalias.com
12yum
if I glined you, then you wouldn't be able to access any server on Ho-oh's Realm network
mmk
meaning, hoohrealm.dynalias.com and hoohrealm.dynalias.net
the command to do it is /kline <nick> reason
and /gline <nick> reason
to unkline/gline it's /unkline <nick> (reason)
mmk
and /ungline <nick (reason)
man I just had a pomegranate and apple sauce
did you understand all that? xD
...somewhat
delicious :3
xD
well
I told you about /sajoin and /sapart earlier, didn't I?
they're force to join/part channel commands
yeah
yeah
and to force someone to change their nick
you need to have superadmin on
superadmin is basically founder of every channel
should only be used we it's needed
mmk
and to change someone's nick
so
yah
basically
and to turn off superadmin
yep
you're superadmin now
feel free to use svsnick on me
xD
:D
:D
/me knows
xD
yeah
I think that's teh basic stuff
mmk
as if you type a wrong command or something
it can kill the IRC
it's dangerous LOL
02o-o
/me probably won't be doing too much

7ZOmy, Chapter 96 of TPBoD has reached 100 comments.
7""In my universityâ€™s student center we have a piano that anyone can play on. A guy sat down and has played nothing but Zelda music from Ocarina of Time. IMMD" IMMD is so fun
7"I went through a McDonaldâ€™s drive thru and said â€œI can has cheeseburger?â€ There was a pause before I heard â€œNom Nom Nomâ€ on the other end. IMMD"
7"The other day in Biology, my teacher tried to explain that semen is comprised mostly of sugar, a blonde girl in the back pipes up â€œthen why does it taste so salty?â€ She promptly ran out of the classroom with the reddest face. IMMD"
:O!!!
Guys!
7aww, come on. That one was hilarious.
I GOT A SNEAKSTER!!!
lol
hey sr
7Totally worth it.
7"This morning, i was walking down a road in my neighborhood, when suddenly i heard a very loud, epic music coming from an apartment. When i got closer, i figured it was the music from Lord of the Rings. Then i yelled â€œFOR FRODOOOâ€. And someone from the apartment yelled back â€œELENDIIIIIIL!!!â€ IMMD"
Helllol everyone
What does IMMD stand for?
7It Made My Day. Taking these all off the website.
7"While looking at magazines in Blockbuster, I noticed a row of them were all turned around and hidden behind other magazines. I turned one around and saw that the cover was a close-up of the Jonas Brothers. I turned it back around and kept walking. IMMD."
LOL
7"The automatic doors at a store got jammed and wouldnâ€™t open. Then a young guy walked up and grabbed the doors, yanking them open. He then turned to me, smiled, and said â€œUse the Forceâ€. IMMD."
Everyone?
THAT INCLUDES ME!
:D
HAI!!!
Hai ~^oo^~
hello?
7"While at school, I saw a guy covered in fake blood dragging another guy in a trash bag. IMMD. FAVE COMMENT â€¦ HALLOWEEN â€“ BEST DAY OF THE YEAR TO DUMP BODIES IN PLAIN SIGHT. â€“ STRATEGIA"
How do you say "hello" to an Acousticophobic blind man?
7"I recently saw a car with the license plate PBZPLIN. (PB is the atomic symbol for Leadâ€¦). IMMD. FAVE COMMENT â€¦ HIS OTHER PLATE READS â€œFEMAIDNâ€ â€“ AIR"
04You don't :O
What if he's your boss?
walk quietly.
But he called you into his office
then you scream and jump out the top story window.
you can't get fired if you're dead
Well, he fired you anyway.
As a dishonor to yiur family.
all right then.
I gotta get ready...
FOR CHEESECAKE MANIA :O!!!
7"While driving to downtown LA, I passed a red convertible being driven by a bleached blonde trophy wife. Her plate? 2LZY469."
x3
7"After explaining to a customer that part of our computer system was acting up, she warned me that Skynet was real and our computers may be becoming self-aware. IMMD."
7"Today, I saw a license plate that read, â€œKAHNNNâ€. IMMD."
10Shi-shi!
/me hugs
/me hugs back
02Hey Sky
10:3
/me yawns
02Hey Pokestar
/me is gathering up old games to trade in for a new one
04Hey
/me wonders what game Shiny has in mind to get
02HM Animal Parade
10Ah, nice
/me guesses Sky doesn't really care :O
/me doesn't know much about that game
02Harvest Moon?
10Sounds similar Animal Crossing for some reason
10to*
02Oh lol, it's not
02HM is a fantasy farming game tbh
7"While at a haunted house, I made some of the employee vampires break character and laugh by thanking them for not â€œsparklingâ€. IMMD"
10Heh, I see x3;
02Let's see if I can explain it...
02HM has a series of games, most are different stories, yet the same. You are a new farmer coming to a new town/island. Once there you learn that the Harvest Goddess is in trouble and you go through a series of obstacles to rescue her
02Hey Beto
rawr
:3
10Kewl O:
02And usually each game it's a different task. Harvest Moon Magical Melody you had to collect 50 notes, to get a note you had to do something special, like a certain number of steps or befriending an animal etc. In HM DS you had to find 60 sprites(little people that look like elves)
/me recognizes the name Harvest Moon
10now I know what HM stands for XP
02It's an old game
02Hey Altair
10yeh, I noticed
hi
/me dates it back to N64
/me crawls around
10Yep
10Til this Sunday
/me headdesks
02I feel so stupid now
/me might go to tomorrow's event while goes mall shopping
02Today we go to the city with the closes Toys R Us and I didn't bring my Pokemon Diamond/Platinum with me
02closest*
10:|
02Guess I'll never get it *sighs*
10Wait
10have you gone already?
10or leaving later?
02I went already
10Oh
10that sucks, badly
02Sorry, I worded the sentance wrong
10:/
02Yeah it does...
02Ugh, sentence*
04:/
10and then I can send you one
02Thanks :O
03I have 5
/me runs
03and flash carts ftw? I can clone as many as want
03*I
10that's a maybe, though, nothing's a set answer yet
10Hopefully my dad is willing to let me go >_>
02Yeah
/me gets his old GC to sell
07zzz
/me slaps Kyu
/me zaps!
10!slap Kyu
/me repeatedly slaps Kyu with a rusty shot put ball and then Ashton Kutcher
/me sets his GameCube on Kyu
/me sits on the GameCube
Drf, what's thedifference between an r4 and flash cart?
/me sits on Sky
10o_O
02I wonder if I should trade in PBR as well...
10PBR wasn't great the 3 times I've played it
02Yeah, I don't play it anymore and it bores me
10We watched Howl's Moving Castle in anime club yesterday~
02Anime Club?
02At your school?
10Yep
02Meh, my school's too small to have those clubs
10My school has 3,000 students, but there's about 30-ish in anime club
04My school has an Anime Club, but that's the only club we have o-o;
02My school only has 500 students XD
10Wow, Pokestar o-o
10We have too many clubs to be honest
03just a bad one :P
02We have 3 and they're all School "funded"
10Lol, funded, why?
:q
Well...
10Ours are free to join
02No, Science Club, Math Club, and Key Club
10except if you want to join a school athletic team
I downloaded the new Mario & Luigi game, but it doesn't work.
10then you'd have to pay for unirforms, etc
03exactly, because R4 sucks :P
10uniforms*
So the Acekard is an R4?
03No
03The Acekard is also a flash cart.
03It should work on the AceKard, odd.
XP It doesn't. Am I supposed to update it?
03Maybe
blah
02All of them are hosted by teachers
03brb
02No students can make a club
10Hosted by teachers is the same for us, kinda
7"I told my mom that I was gonna go see new moon just to ruin it for other people by yelling rude things. She high fived me and said donâ€™t get caught. IMMD FAVE COMMENT â€¦ PERSONALLY, Iâ€™D BE GRATEFUL FOR SOMEONE TO DISTRACT ME FROM KRISTEN STEWARTâ€™S SORRY EXCUSE FOR ACTING. PROPS, OP. â€“ ANGIE"
10Anime club is basically ran by this sophomore girl, but the one of the art teachers let us borrow her room
02Well, yeah, of course
02I'm in and out, sorry. Gathering up games to trade in to get HM AP
10No prob
10I'm doing other things as well, watching AMVs :P
02Lol
04Sorry x.x
02Hmm?
02It's fin
02e
04://
02I'm hoping PBR will help...
10No suprise beta channels on YouTube now have advertisements on them...
/me eats it
/me points Skylands towards Adblock Plus
02It's Karl! He joined the circus! *dies*
10Nah
10this computer is running out of space anyway
10I've cleaned out just about everything useless
/me refuses to remove her files
10Flashdrive is full as well
03o.o
03adblock is like 1kb
10Oh?
03It's a Firefox addon./
10Eww, Firefox
/me runs
03wtf?
10Well, I don't sue Firefox
10so...
10use**
03OK, AdMuncher then?
03that's what I use.
03it's not free but there's a cracked one XD
10Maybe
10the YouTube ads aren't too bad, there was only one lol
10but in other cases, AdMuncher could help
14Hello everyone.
02You can milk a sheep? ovo'
12well
12i've done enough torrenting drf
10Huh, Shiny?
/me is looking at the game features
02You can milk sheep in it ovo' first time I've ever seen that...
10Yeah, certain types of sheep can
02I know goats can
02But never in any HM game could you milk a sheep ovo'
10it's where France, Greece, Italy, and some parts of Europe get their best cheeses
02Ya sure it ain't goat?
10Nope
10Goats CAN be milked, but sheep can as well
03WTF
/me eats drf
02I never heard of it ok?
7My headphones are randomly magnetic
/me yawns
/me lies down
14arent all of them magnetic due to the speakers in them?
/me brings out a pencil and paper and doodles
7... I have no idea. I never noticed it before.
14yeah. I know the old headphones used magnets in them. dont know if they still use them for it.
hey Sky
/me anticipates New Moon for next week
03EW TWILIGHT
/me grabs a shotgun
10EWW DRF
10:P
/me also grabs a crucifix and garlics, GTFO VAMPIRES
/me protects Jacob Black
03who?
10The werewolf
10in New Moon
I have to see it, too. ): I don't even like Twilight, but my friend doesn't wanna go with her parents to see it
/me puts a ring of garlic around her neck
/me noms the garlic bread!
02I thought he wasn't a werewolf, just a shapeshifter
10Whut.
/me shrugs
02Just what my friend said
03> Dracula was OK, but WTF @ Twilight
03> How can people even compare it to Harry Potter >_>
03> At least Harry Potter has a STORY, not some girl who has a crush on a fake vampire
10Btw, did you hear Robert (Edward Cullen) and Kristin (Bella) got married and then divorced like 2 weeks later? LMAO
03because they're stupid...
10Yep
10they wanted publicity obviously
03LOL
02Just like any movie star
/me slaps skylands with a invisible hand
10I can see them getting back together again, though
07the invisible hand of the economy?!
/me runs
10Just because they still have Eclipse and Breaking Dawn to film, if they do it
:D
03I hope the second movie fails so hard they don't make more :P
07how can you prove it if it's invisible?
07XD
10Gah
10Altair isn't around
10In your dreams, drf
10Although New Moon will most likely not be as successful as Twilight
10Twilight was over rated from the very beginning
03duh
03it's a fad, is what it is
Twilight shouldn't have been successful as it was.
10the die-hard fans around my school gave up
twilight the movie was very... boring
If it didn't have the fanbase of the book
03well what annoys me is the people who read it and are all like ZOMFG EDWARD CULLEN
It would've fell flat on it's face
He sparkles!
03If people read it and thought it was a good book, whatever, I'd still disagree but not hate them nearly as much
.... Cheap Wal-Mart sparkles
well what annoys me is the people who read it and are all like ZOMFG EDWARD CULLEN < qft
10I as well got bored, but I still want to see how bad they messed up New Moon
10Lol fangirls
03but it's because so many people started talking about it like it's the best thing evar, then it just became really stupid
/me screams "JACOB BLACK!!"
03Fangirls are far worse than fanboys5 :P
10.-.
03-5
10Durr
10Fanboys can't sound too excited, otherwise they'd sound gay o3o
/me crawls into his Anti-Twilight hole
/me runs
It's hilarious how they drool over Robert what's-his-name's face
And he absolutely hates twilight, despite being a main character
hi Shiny
10Who?
/me hugs
03At least it's not as bad as this guy I know who started liking Twilight to get girls >_>
02Hey
/me hugs back
The guy who plays Edward, the creeper dude
03And then he'd sell them bootleg copies... which is like, not only a bad thing to do, but it's also a bad movie
/me jumps in Shiny's hole too
10Robert Pattinson
Yes, him
They almost killed him, the fangirls
Was hilarious
10Heh
10if only Taylor Lautner had more fans
:2
:3
I'm not trying to bash twilight, I read the books before the whole fad and didn't mind them
It's just that EVERYONE won't shut up about it, it earns a movie that was worse than Eragon and the fangirls suck it up, making it earn more money for ANOTHER crap movie to waste money on
10Books > Movies for sure
03Movies are so much easier to watch than books though
/me runs
02Unless it's fan-animations
02Because then the directors actually read the books :3
03though audiobooks are awesome, that's where it's all at XD
10At least Stephenie Meyer didn't overdo the Twilight book series
Everyone else did, though
10Yeh
Notice all the new fantasy books = vampires and werewolves
10They made some television series called Vampire-something
03and then that one movie that came out recently...
02Vampire Diaries
10What Shiny said
Vampire Diaries, and there's another
02Oh, now you pay attention to me >.>
10and a vampire movies
10movie*
Billions of rip off books
/me thinks
it's more vampires than werewolves
04I could try, Shiny
02Kk
and the only recent werewolves book series I'm aware of is actually good
I can't find ANY new books at the library because they're all crappy vampire novels inspired by the movie
They're remaking Blood and Chocolate
Which looks horrid
04Good morning
04That would be just as nice, Shiny
10Ah, it was "The Vampire's Assistant"
02Hey Lyon...
07ahoyhoy
04G morning Lyon
07o3o
10gawd
10too much vampires
Exactlyyy
04Hey Kyu, Shiny, PS, and Sky
hi Lyon
7o3o
04Hey Max
7LYON
7Hai,
7.*
04QUAN
/me titanburnglompz
lol Castlevania
10there are other vampire movies as well
7o3o
/me sighs
10coming out this year, like 7 >_>
04What's the matter Shiny?
/me yawns
/me 7's Flash Fire ability activates?
/me Wiki'd it
Yeah, hopefully they'll flop
02I broke the bracelet my grandma got for me...
04Oh....
10Funny part, they all look uninteresting
brb... bro wants on...
/me 7pokes Lyon
It's just people trying to drain money out of the twihards
7Wanna scan the first part of that fanfic I mentioned last time?
/me nods
Thinking 'teens want vampires? let's give them half ass movies that involve hot celebrities and zero to no plot!"
04Hmm?
04Sure
04And bai Max
It hurts your eyes?
/me yawns
02Hey Jess
07ohai
hi
10Hi Jess
oh yeh artis in london
x.x
7It's the quality of colour I think. It just makes them go all defocoused and then when I go back onto something else after getting bored of the game I have to blink many times.
12hmm
Hullo, Kyu, Jess, and Skylands.
Weird, I don't have any problem with it.
7probably your screen settings.
Did you manage to get the to the boss, it's the only bit of the game that's actually fun. :P
So... we decided not to go today.
02Hey Kipi
7couldn't be bothered.
7I got to level two.
Wow.
Too hard? XD
7No. Too boring.
Admit it.
It's too hard after level two for you.
7admit what? You can only admit the truth. And the truth is it's boring as hell.
I did admit it.
But I bet you can't do it.
7No. I have a short attention span and it's /boring/
You're attention span is shorter than 2 minutes?
mine is occasionally
Wow.
Well at least your attention span is better than that of a goldfish.
7It's amazing how long two minutes can seem when all you're doing is moving the mouse around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around and
/me yawns
But the point is, I don't think you could get past level 3.
14ADD Ftw?
7The point is, I'm not six. You can't manipulate me like that to finish your stupid boring game.
I don't know the game o.o I'm easily entertained
Trust me, it's the most boring thing ever.
7and when I say something's boring, you know it's boring. I'm easily amused by a bouncing ball for like twenty minutes :P
Anyway, I can't even get past level 3. :/
http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1258206812
10Oh shiz
/me accidentally closed a window she was listening to music non
10on*
XD THATS AMAZING
/me can't do it on a touchpad x32
*x3
Bookmarked, great study hall game x3
Lawl, it's SOOO boring.
I KNOW
but it's like
Better than study hall
To be honest, I should get an award for making the only game that can get boring after 20 seconds.
7dari, make something with explosions.
Wth. I can't even do level 2.
7:P
02lol
02hi
Just a second, I'll make a button to skip to the boss, try that, it's marginally more fun.
It has shooting as well. XD
10Not funny D:
/me pounces Shiny
02Hmm?
anway
I'm off
I'll probably play that game tonight x3

Why is the boss boring?
04TPBoD?
Too hard?
7mostly. and too cluster fuck.

I like the cluster.

/me 7uses Heat Wave
Unlucky?*
It's hot here
02concluded?
/me is warmed up to the boiling point

7Still. You don't have to have a persona to be a furry
7W'ox?

I haven't made them yet lol :P
7You make /fursuits/. You say so SO much.

7RORA
07o3o
07hai Roara
7Wow, I'm up to nearly 7k words. X3
02Hey...
7k words for a fan fic isn't much, just so you know o3o
07yeah lol
7Un-ban me, wench. and you may be spaired their wrath.
7Well, think about the people who write three-million-word ones.
Too late. :o
/me 6coughs
07exactly
07aim for that
/me runs
6I haven't counted up the words in my completed ones
no-one writes three-million word fics
7what?
6but I run on average 2k words per chapter
6and both had about 25 chapters
Post sent.
7And I write one/two-shots.
The Wheel of Time series is around 10-11K pages and ~5mil words
what?
6My WIP stories are going to be double that in chapter
Nothing. :)
over 12 books (so far)
7Oh. This will have hilarious reprecussions.
7Link me.
/me 6doesn't understand one/two shots 8D
7thanks for the link.
7They're like extended drabbles or microfictions
7...shit.
7not in pm.
7I said NOTHING.
7Actually, they are microfictions.
htanks guys I'll have to stop it now
Funtime.
6my definition of a micro fiction is like...5 chapters
7It wasn't me. I was never gunna actually do it.
6SHY is supposed to be 10, when I actually get around to finishing o3o
7Hell, I lost the link ages ago.
7true. I could google it.
7but that would require doing something.
/me titanburnglompz Roara
7Microfictions, hmm, are about, what, 1,000 words? *checks*
7Actually, they can be around 300 words. o.o
thanks for letting em print screen guys :)
7But I consider anything under 10k words to be flash fiction.
04Bah
well, I didn't want you on there anymore!
04I wish we had more creative writing at our school
LOL, what do you think you can do with that?
6hmm
7maybe try and pull an SR on us, and convince us we violated the internet code of conduct.
6I think it's about time to take a field trip to Michaels
6o3o
6I love these
look I'll just set it to private now
/me plays with multitracks :D

03I need to find the Xbox 360 rip of the original Rock Band
and watch the explosion
03and I gotta see if Guitar Hero uses the same song format :O
heh
6dude, there's a Guitar Hero 5 now?
03Everyone wants multitracks of the Beatles one but Harmonix knows this and encrypted htem all so nobody can figure out how to open the songs x.x
03Yes?
6where'd4 go? o-o
04Roara
03There's also Guitar Hero Van Halen and that crappy Band Hero
03and DJ Hero
04World Tour IS 4

034 was World Tour
03yeah
6oh

6GH3 was awesome
6Through the Fire and Flames ftw
03GH3 WAS awesome
well I'm sorry I could get kicked off this computer if you did that
7you should know by now, unless we're actually motivated by something, we'll just mess with you.
6...
6hmm

03Agreed/
6I should go play that 8D
03"Guitar Hero III Complete Soundtrack" torrent FTW?
03Though some of the rips are really bad quality x.x
and probably never be let to cadets again
while we're on this what have people completed TTFAF on?
Cool.
7and just to mention, it was his i- wait, wtf?
7how does that work?
7you put something on the internet. it got spammed. ONOEZ.
03Only guitar in GHIII on the end credits, on easy XD
03but it's in Smash Hits, so you can do it on drums and stuff :O
if I get into trouble on the internet, I get banned from cadets since my dad will keep me in his sight for the rest of his life >.>
03I also imported it into Rock Band using RawkSD, so I can use No Fail Mode ^_^
/me runs
You kicked me, so we tricked you. :P
look I'm sorry no hard feelings?
7is the circle of troll.
Sure, whatever. It was a joke anyway.
just please don't ok?
I'm still putting it on private now
bleh, I've completed it on medium, hyperspeed 5
7unless you start throwing knives at my house, I highly doubt I'll put it on there.
7because it would require actually doing something.
6googlemaps on blackberry phones ftw
7and if we were going to do it, we'd never /tell/ you.
7with that thought, I bid my goodbye.
for all I know you could still have done it, you're just denying it

7Sometimes, it takes age.
7The mind perceives things with more clarity as one develops. o3o
/me tries and fails, just like everything
You're now boring me. So I'm going.
6I see the world differently 8D
7And so does everyone else's.
04Gah
7We all have different viewpoints of the same Earth.
7And now I'm getting into prose-like wordings.
6it's so much fun to look at objects from an artist's point of view
6"how can I simplify that and draw it?" "what colors would you call those?" etc
12headache ;-;
/me 6patpats bree
7Heh, scenery is odd when you see it in real life, and when you think of it as art, I say, 'Hmm, it doesn't look realistic... o3o There's no foreshortening, the shadows don't fall the right way, etc."
6hmm
6I'm torn about how Id paint my room
6*I'
6*I'd
03o.o
7Paint it polka-dot blue-and green!
/me 7flees
03My room is completely barren :D
03but it IS a dorm and we aren't allowed to mess it up XD
6quan
6...
03The closest to personalizing it is putting up a $4 poster of the U.S.S. Enterprise...
6did you just make that up? ._.
7Yush. o3o
6._.
7What, is it incredibly close to what you were thinking?
6you didn't know that my bead spread for winter is polkadot blue and green?
6*bed
07hah! take that, ubers!
04You know what
7O.o
6...?
/me suicide attacked a Kyogre and Lugia o3o
04I think I draw better when in a common doodle, rather than when I actually try my hardest
7Weeeeell, must be incredibly coincidence.
7'scuse me, incredible*
6suicide attacked? with what and how lol
7And yes, I should've used a different word.
04And when I'm using Pen of all things
07Bronzong's explosion lol

07Mysterial is such hax o3o
12cool
03I have mine plugged in with Ethernet
03as our dorm has uber secure Wi-Fi x.x
6I'm leeching off of a neighbor's wifi I think
6I don't know the code to our's
12lol
07XD
12XD
07lol DRF
07mine is pretty secure too
6I think it's my neighbors behind us, hence why the only spot my DS can pick up a signal is back there
07so that they can connect without any hassle
12Anyone watched the movie 2012?
6nope
7Ditto.
02Guess it's just comfortable for ya Lyon
12I just finished watching it...
12it was AWESOME
7Oh, and Lyon; it's because you want it to turn out nice rather than casually blow it off.
12hello shiny
02Hey 365
6hmm, I can't decide if I want to paint an ocean scene on my room, a wintery scene, or paint a random mural on the corner
7Really? I heard it was cliche.
7Paint what coordinates with your room the best. :)
6I actually had this really cool idea of painting an ocean scene, and then make a mural of some ancient design of the legendary birds in the corner o3o
6dunno if my parents would let me away with that last one
04Shiny, you are right
6either way though...my room is in desperate need of a repaint
04I really don't like using Pencil
12lol
04But If I make a mistake in pen, yeah I can't rub it out
/me 7blinks
6OHOHOH! I know! I could make an evening scene and paint a night sky on top

12that was a quick visit
He came fer me
12:)'
Bugging me to trade pokemon
12i see
I know him from school :q
Can't remember his real name though
XD
12i've seen enough pokemon cards for today
02LOL KIPI
02xD
-~-
Anyhoo, he goes to the morning session; I go to the night session so he tries to keep contact through TST pms
12i think it's fun beating cocky kids :D
X.x I'm not that good at battling
12at least you're willing to admit that though
02lol
12i've met kids who thought they were pretty much the best players around
12then they'd have like 3 ubers on their team
12and i still wouldn't break a sweat beating them even without any ubers
Kinda hard to argue against a nearly 80% defeat rate. XP The only battles I've won were against friends who owned, didn't care about the game, and people that were willing to play cloned pokemon against originals. XD;;
12lol
owned but didn't care**
12at least you don't have pokemon with OHKO moves though
12...do you?
Nope
12exactly this last kid i fought
12killed my staller by landing a hit on his first try with horn drill >_>

Loony Toons! I love that show!

show was teh pwnage
it's fun how in all games you kill one enemy and three pop out of nowhere
AAAAAAAA. I just tried the NaNoWriMo word counter, it says 19 901 words when OpenOffice says 20 018 D:
I haaate that! Unless they're easy to kill
Then it's fun button mashing hack and slash
openoffice includes numbers, -'s, etc.
maybe nanowrimo ignores those
Probably... 100 words is nothing, but it is annoying when I stayed up all night to reach 20 000 when in reality I didn't :/
04Heya all

/me is at the Rainbow Arc :D
02And again, just with practice
02The only reason that my first scratch sprite was "good" was because I'm "good" at drawin
13Then that means... D8
02Hmm?

6no, dragon RP
02Ah, I see
04Random but you know it's time to change jobs when you really don't want to go in, lol.

04I'll have to keep it though until I move and find another.
2o3o
2O3O
2well

2I'll just do it and see what Lyon decides to do.

02Na, it's too late, and ya probably won't want me there
02Which is why I didn't join up in the first place
6BURD
2o3o
/me 6splodes
2you should've
6shiny
6I just joined
/me 2tackles
6you should too
02I thought you joined long ago Ovo'
6no lol
6dragon rp?
6I just joined a couple pages ago
02Oh, I didn't know that...
6lol
02I might just do it then, though I still gotta think of a character
6LOL THIS IS AWESOME
02Ugh, internet so slow today x.x
02LOL that IS epic!!
6check that gallery
6that place is devoted to RBY-ifing the later pokemon
02Gallery won't load ;v;
2XD
2o3o
02Maybe I'll use her o3o
/me 2trades Sapphire for Gold
2EEEEEEEEEEE!
/me 2then uses h4x and gets Silver, too
2O3O
2OH'I thought that was a typo ^-^'''
/me 2hugs
07LOL
07I fail
2o3o
07*I'm listening to Arrow's battlestations: midway intro videos just to hear him say something o___O
07*It actually does make me feel a bit better, though it's silly because I'm not interested in listening to what he actually says LOL
/me 2tut-tuts at Shiny
02Huh?
2D:< You shouldn't throw Creatures of Light
02You're right, she's water and could kill me in one hit ;v;
04Why does Ho-oh have to have such large wings? x.x
02Coz they're such big birds
6because big wings are awesome
6and technically, alot of pokemon should be able to lift off the ground with the wings they have
There are some that fly without wings.
6excluding those
6psychic powers don't count
Pokemon don't have to follow rules. All the water types violate conservation of mass frequently.
6true that
6which is why I said "technically"
6doesn't mean they dont
unless they just ignore the fact that things tend to keep the same density
Three of those running shifts of Hydro Pump could irritate a large area of desert.
It's never addressed where the water actually comes from.
/me 6points out just how MUCH water a pokemon shoots out of its mouth in a hydro pump
A lot more than the mass or volume of the pokemon :>
/me points to Saphire and flees
6good example: Pokemon 3
6that totodile used water gun (a powerful one at that) for a LONG time
6for the amount spat out and that duration of time, it could easily have filled up a high shcool swimming pool
I've also wondered how many squirtles you'd have to strap to a vehicle before it could fly, using their jets like engines.
lol
Those being the lightest ones I know of that can do a hydro pump.
6oh yep
6there's the other famous example
02XD
6apparently water is magically summoned *coughhackedcough* into their bodies
2LOL
/me points to Saphire again
Hmm... arn't some of the other types able to summon sand in a similar way?
2oh, she teleports it into them ? o3o
6yeah I would imagine so
6Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability
02No, she creates the water in them o3o
2o3o
2ohkay...
/me 2points
If you had them attack a water jet, that'd make one very powerful attack... but I doubt the animators would approve of a join attack that strips flesh from bone.
2How 'bout Buizel's... uh... ability
2forgot them anme
2*name
6although I alwayn imagine Tyranitar stirring up the existing sad and whipping it around the area in a circulation
/me keeps thinking Aqua Jet...
6aqua jet is an attack
2Swift Stream
02I know
02But that's what popped into my head, even though it's not right XD
02What about it?
2o3o
2its sort of like Sand Stream
6how? buizel doesn't make it rain
I also had the idea a while ago of defeating a smaller pokemon just by de-balling a snorlax directly above it. *squish*. Might be the only thing it's good for.
6that's drizzle
2o3o
2oh
2I realized something yesterday
Meowth has a move that summons money from nowhere, too. The one in the anime being an exception.
2*yesterday
6also
2in my dreams... the laws of physics all apply
6it has swift swim lol >_>
2and magic exists
2but then...
2Common sense is non-existant
2ie: my friend accused me of eating his fish while there's a guy eating fish behind me
2o3o
Inhale to go up, exhale to go down.
6I've had one of those, vyl
2and today, I broke my arm and did a one-armed pull-up while being suspended by my sleeve and a rock about 100 yards off the ground
That's how divers do fine boyancy control.
2that'll never happen; I'm weak and I'm terrified when I can't see the ground properly
2anyway, I got back up, and no one cared that I'd just surpassed all these limits and broken my arm O=o
2*O=o
2*I=o
2*I-i
2*O-o
2there we go D:<

02LOL
/me hugs Lyon and follows him to school
13And at first i mistook it for the anime that now have it's name forgotten forever and just called "That anime with "ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH" in it.
13Which contains just as many plot twists, also this font colour is strange.
02Better than grey tbh XD
13And if someone goes "Omaigod my eyes" it's Skylands' fault!
13But it's awesome 8D
10Lolwhut
13Before i started (over)using "tbh" on TST, i only ever saw it really used on one other forum. I feel like i have done an success.
02It was YOU *points to Sky*
02I thought you overused "etc"
13that as well
02And made me want to overuse it as well :O
/me sticks her tongue out
13but that's an IRL acronym thing
10etc etc etc X3
13ja
10My spanish teacher uses etc alot

13I've never heard them say it.
13But they ALWAYS use it to spam.
10J makes an 'h' sound in Spanish
04I have about 5 minutes, so PM me now Shiny

13omg i know that. and even then i never got it.
02Na, that's all I wanted to PM you Lyon
02I'm good now :P
13That's a shame. Thanks for clarifying it though xD
13Juan = Huan etc

07o3o
Roara, someone on DA took one of your images again without adding a source...and when I pointed it out, this person meant you had stolen it from lugia.us....
gosh, how retarded can people be?
07lool
07link?
07o3o
6oooh, link please
don't have it here now
6I love these
10gah
6what image?
10We can't go to the mall tonight
/me sulks
one of the Lugia pictures you did for the site - the one's Arti wrote "IF YOU USE THEM GIVE FULL CREDIT TO THE ARTISTS AND LINK HERE" at
wb
:/
6the free pages?
10Thanks :\
also need to go soon
6well, they ARE free, but yeah someone needs to put credit
/me 6looks it up
13same
10>_<
they are free, IF you give credit
/me needs something to do
6technically, but I drew them (Kyu lined them)
6but yes
13You could always
bleh
hi PS
/me hugs
Nice picture
6man, I don't even know what pose it was
^^
I need to go now though D:
10I could always what, Xeli?
6trying to find this is like searching for hay in the needle stack
/me huggles all and poofs
bbl
2XD
2possible, but incredibly hard
2nope o3o
try searching for a needle in a needle stack
2trying to figur- ow!
07anyways
07going to the mall o3o
2trying to figure out how many people the earth can sustain T^T
2bye~
ahh, the artist edited the link into the comment...
6loltiming
6I JUST found it
if we're smart about it the earth can probably sustain a few dozen billion
unfortunately, we're not, so we're struggling with 6.5 bil
but this comment here is just lol:
All credit goes to ~thewhitewolf-mii it's her character, thought pokemon belongs to pokemon.
lolwut
6lolyeah
2o3o
13i dunno
2o3o
10k
10oh wow
2thanks, Horo
10Light Latios is on TST forums
2but I'm suposed to find a reliable site
10it must have snuck on or something
10(and yay I remember to say "it"_
10)*
6I'd say that, but the name is different :P
a reliable estimate doesn't exist, and it all depends on just how much you do to help with this
7Sardoodledom. O_o
2Time
2its...
2its a club
even if you call your table just "sheila", it's still a table
for instance, irrigating Africa. That much land would produce a HUGE amount of food, plenty for a population many times bigger than current
2you have to go find the original copy, then hound THEM about it
2they just follow a template about what to write in the comments
2uh...
2Horo
2you can't just set up an irrigation system in Africa by snapping your fingers
and? What does it matter if it's a club or a single dumbnut?
2sorta
that's why I said depending on how much effort you put in to maximising the capacity
or do you think dumbness should be divided through the members within the club?
6loooool
2-_- can you just let me finish
2NO, dumbness does not get divided
2that's why you have to go find the original, see?
it'd cost billions, minimum, but the population supported by it would be massive
10and I'ma leave this server for now, so meh
I'm monitoring entire DA for any Lugia-related art, don't worry ;)
2however
2in this ca- :|
/me 6slaps Kyu
2in this case, there is no original copy
6you're supposed to be at the mall :P
07well I was putting my bike pump back lol
2so you have to go badger the team about it and have THEM yell at whoever's work it is
07turns out there's an actual hole in the tire, not just a flat D=
2o3o wow
lol
XD
/me looked at the link o3o
07anyways, leaving now
2'kay
ahhh yes...
2o3o
2jeez, her icon is driving me nuts X-x
2o3o
otherwise she'll be facing a lawsuit sooner or later...
2well
2o3o
2yeah, I know
6not the character, while that still is lolsomer
6-r
2:|
6true
maybe I should contact my friends at Nintendo and ask them if they wanna sue the jerk for trademark violation ;)
6I kinda want to comment telling them to put credit to me, not just TST, for those linearts
6but I dun wanna get involved
I'm almost in the mood
2o3o
6o3o
2I don't think that's a good idea, Time
three now in fact
in public relations and product testing
2I still don't think its a good idea
why? Maybe it helps those pestboils from stealing artwork if one of them gets sued for five million dollars?
2well...
2may I point out that millions of people around the world don't give credit, and counting, as well?
2therefore, if you just sue one, that's not going to really solve the problem
6I'm gonna comment
2and also, let's take an example
6because I can
2sure
2oh
2anyway, let's take Shiny
so, if a murderer can't be proven to have murdered a person clearly, all murderers may say "hey, you set THAT guy free! Set me free, too!", if I may use this analogy?
2sure
2*sigh*
2okay,
2You can use it, but that's not where I'm going
neither did I force, nor did I ask you to follow me anywhere
2:|
2y'know what?
2this isn't getting us anywhere
to be honest: It is
2go ahead and get your friends and sue this one person out of millions for every cent/pound whatever she's got
maybe we can't make the world perfect with one strike, but each of us can help to make this world a little bit better
and every big target starts with a first, small step
2GRAUGH
2:|
2okay then
/me 2starts shouting at her classmate and telling her how she could be a better person
2is that going to get the world anywhere?
2not really, its going to send me straight to anger management
*pokes in* hello?

!lag
[Kipi] Lag with ocean.lugia.us is 1.045secs
k, as this jerk on DA was so picky, I removed the "please" from the coloring pages site
6You can edit that page?
...
Admin?^^
6^that
6Quan said it
6I asked arti to do that, but it never happened
will add it now
6I think the respectful thing to do is divide that page by artist or something, so people know who drew them
Do not redistribute these images without full credit to the original artists listed above!
any 1?
does that sound okay to you?
7Without the !; it makes it sound more formal. :P
6yup
modified and published
6oh yeah quan
6I wont have it to you tonight, but I was gonna convert "deep drive"
6did you still want it?
7How about deleting the 'WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED COLOURING THEM AND YOU WANT TO POST THEM ONLINE, SAY WHERE YOU GOT THEM FROM.' part, TS?
7Yush, Rora, but the original video seems to be deleted; so I found secondary sources.
7On YT, that is
6link?

/me 2kicks herself in the mouth
you're not the only one being blamed.
this piece of art is the only one not being deleted and the stealing user being banned from DA.
If you want to join them - just go ahead and tell. I bet we can establish that, too.

one thing needs to be said
this girl is 19, if her profile doesn't lie
she's a native english speaking person...
...and her english is worse than mine, who only learned english as his second language around 12 years ago
no - longer
either she's lazy, dumb or a mixture of both
lol
12Hello ^v^
hey there
12hello TS
I just decided not going to sleep til in about 19 hours
12Ovo
12what time is it there?
01:39 atm
one and a half hour after midnight
12AM!!
12oh
I still don't understand why some still use clocks with "am" and "pm" in it
I do
instead just continue conting til 23:59
12well, its about 4:40 pm here
/me runs
12XD
it is 18:41 here :D
7It's shorter, TS?
or...it's 16:41. xP
12thats military time
yeah, 11:59 pm is MUCH shorter than 23:59, right
No
12yes
7I meant when you talk about day and night.
But 4:41 pm is shorter than 16:41
:D
12lol
you fail again :)
12me?
7LOL, that person on dA just hid all of those comments.
LOL
4:41 pm is exactly ONE character longer than 16:41
14I SHALL CLEAR IT UP
14Some of us buy clocks with P.M. and A.M. because those are the only clocks we can find
14>:O
12exactly
I thought it was because those circle clocks would look weird if they had 24 hours on them.
12hello ^v^
hi
14And anyway, my computer clock doesn't say 18:44 right now
mine says 19:44:45
12in about 5,000,000,000 years, the time will be 48, instead of 24
mine 01:45
10ok
12 48 hours
yeah, we'll all LOVE those great 28 hour-workdays...
14I don't have a job >:3
12me nether

and I will be there in around five hours
14FIVE
/me 14runs
12Ovo
see - there's no sense in going to sleep now
12that makes cents
12about 25 cents
/me 12runs
14About 46 cents is correct
12Ovo
/me 6cuddles his leg. "What are you doing right now?"
10about to sleep
/me 10yawns again
well, looks like the 19 year-young-kid finally admitted her being wrong...
12lolwut
"look i already noted them and they will remove it since everyone is being hurt. ill make my own shadow lugia."
/me 10lays down
12oh
14Should I know what that means?
plus all comments by me, Aurora and everyone else have been removed
12Ovo
12on what?

12Scientific fact: the earths rotation is slowing down in about 1 second every 50,000 years.
6...:O
14That makes a big difference
14xD
12lol
/me 6chuckles and then laughs, "Hey!" X3
12so, in about 5,000,000,000
/me 10stops and puts him down
12the earths rotation will be at 48
scientific fact: the earth rotation speeds up by 0.002% during fall and winter and slows down again during spring and summer
14Scientific fact: I don't care.
14Just kidding
does it matter what's gonna happen in 5,000,000,000 years?
12thats because the orbit is elliptical
12well, no
no, that's because the leaves are falling off most of the trees during fall
12lol
14But it's still fun to know XD
XD
12yes
12yes it is
/me 10lays down again
it's the same like someone spinning on ice: If you spin and pull your arms closer to you, your spin gets faster
14Do leaves really make that much of a difference?
14They're still on Earth, they fall to the ground
12I alredy know that
oh yes, they do
10i only have 25 mins
well, the one spinning does still have his arms, right?
2o3o
12Ovo
14:|
14Touche my friend, touche.
12lolwut
12Fact: the bigger the star, the shorter its lifespan

2Fact: "All your base are belong to us" is clichÃ©
12XDD
14How many mosquitoes would it take to fill an egg?
2depends
depends on what egg you're talking about
2what kind of egg is it?
12lol
14BROWN EGG
14:D
2how old/big are the mosquitoes?
2...

12hmm?

10wot are you doing?
12well, red dwarfs are very small
14YES

14Black holes die?
2Niau
12lol
14GUEST
12yes they do
7Listen; black holes are areas of gravity where the gravity is so strong, even light can't escape.
2stars can either collapse into Black Holes or explode o3o
7Gravity doesn't explode.
/me 2agrees with Quan
2its also highly condensed matter
2..
2I feel like France
14Worm holes

because you know they're joking
and even when some idiots are being serious
It doesn't hurt

hi
07x3;;;
07Hi
I knowwww :(
but..
07butwhat
it'll just be more pots that I don't need
07Arrow is SO close ot pot making rank B o3o
07Mm
07Ive been keeping arrow busy
07making 100 MP, Stam and HP pots
I never ever use stamina, I can sell HP (or give them to you guys) and MP I have plenty of left
07and now he's going to make the same for himself
I have like.. 60MP100s left >.>
07In fact I am working on making his stack of 100 MP100's...
07o_o wow
07Im producing them asdf
plus blue herbs.
07We're going to do our G3 finals
07And for that
07we have INSANE requirements
0715 Adv. Feathers (as of right now we have plenty on Ed the guild mule, we will post when we are down to 10 feathers)
07100-150 MP 100's pots
07150-200 HP 100's pots
0780-100 Stam 100's pots
0715 holy waters per team member
079 party feathers (3 per team member)
0715 recovery pots (5 per team member)
0720 normal feathers for per team member
079 campfire kits (3 per team member)
071 healer coupon
071 bank coupon
071 blacksmith coupon
07So yeah
lol
sounds fun.
07We have to have all that, we're working on the pots atm, we're soon done with my lot and I'm working with Arrow's supply
07Nope =(
some of it is easy to get though, which is good
lol i still have a banjo-kazooie plushie
07I have pf's for myself
07and yeah
What game is this?
07Pots are just tedious
mabinogi
07What rank is your potmaking?
07=)
lol F or E.
07Ah
07Arrow's at C but he's soon able to rank it up =)
cuz I perfect train everything >.>
07o_o
07don't do that
07with pot making
07that's
07INSANITY
oh well!
07Quil wtf
07LOL
I'ma do it anyway
07I perfect train healing
07that's all
07r8 atm
lol
07But now working on prod mastery
mine's still 9 D:
07and then metallurgy
07Also working on ranking defense
if I didn't perfect train, I could quickly get up to R1 ice >.>
07At rank B atm, won't stop until it's at 9
07then WHY perfect train asdf
but I need to saaave my AP for spear when/if I ever get it.
plus perfect training is great for just after rebirthing
you can rank up and gain like 5-7 levels from a good skill
/me pokes nintendo
reminds me.. I should check and see if I got the title I needed. >.>
07Ahhhh
/me pokes nintendo again
/me points to the lake want to go for a dip?

/me still chasing aw whats the matter its just water hehehe
:(

/me spreads hes wings out as he hits the ground and starts to run again

hey anyone here know about if/then/while statements?
and Quil*
/me hugs bak
back*
If __ is true, then ___ blank is true.
The scientific thing
?*
/me climbs out again then shakes all the water off
o3o?
Lol
-blank
I meant programming wise.
Oh
I want to know what I can follow up a while statement with
/me shakes the water off
No
/me lays down
like if the 'while' is no longer true, if it proceeds to 'else' or 'then'
/me is downloading Pokemon Rumble o3o
im going to sleep and dont bug me!!!
/me falls asleep
/me *rolls eyes then heads to his cave*
12hiii
hai
12hi
hello
quil, if the while is no longer true, it proceeds straight to what appears after the block
14Hey.
hy
I see.
rawr rawr grrsnarl
/me si sleeping peacefully

I seee.
okay. thanks
o_o ok.....
I'm in the mood for Castlevania now
buh bye, people
later
12hmm
...had some where glitch happen when i played dotd yesterday the attack of the golem level was using cynder then all of a sudden she couldn't use melee attacks or elemental breaths anymore >_> that was annoying
lol
...
?
i've had times when the pointer on the wii version stopped working as well ......
lol. The price for going through the viral video game show is a 10 minute rick roll xd
xD*
:|
12o-o
arghhh this statement is overly complex..
12hi
what statement?
12:)
bye everyone
7If you have the gamecube version of ANB then enter the Konami code followed by LL RR for invincibility
yeah i have that version never tried the code since its pretty much impossible to die unless you suck at video games
7true.
hey there
blerghhh..... anyone want to look over a bit of script for me? >.>
invincibilty would've been VERY helpful in TEN
7Yeah
7I fucking hated TEN
7never finished it
I messed something up but I don't know what
7I need to hook up my bro's old PS2 and finish it.
7and piss around in spider man2
what language?
I'll do it, though it's possible I won't know proper formatting
eh. if I put 'end' within 'while', does it just end the 'while' or the entire script?
hate those freaking dogs >_>
I'd think it'd end the whole script. Usually while, if there is a closing statement, uses something different like wend
depends on the language
ergh.
where should I post it?
the forum I guess?
um, ok. one sec.
sounds like it from the title, wouldn't you think?
yeah. but wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
also, is there a 'code' tag on this forum or something?
/me lets someone else answer, as he doesn't use forum much
present
/me pokes above question
just give it a try - I haven't tried it yet
but I'm quite sure SMF is capable to
use preview if you don't want to risk embarrasing yourself
I know.
yeah, well, not everyone does, so I was just making sure ;P
http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4464.0 posted.
have you got enough }'s, to start with
also, that many blocks makes for REAALLY ugly code
my checker said the syntax was correct.
and I'm new to scripting >.>
if you do need to make that many checks, there is usually some kind of and statement so you can do it with one if
yeah. not really sure what that is though :/
xtest -= 1 <-- what does -= set?
decreases it by 1
and it's usually 'and' '&&' or '&', from my experience
would be the same as xtext = xtest-1
hm. could try it later
I see some 'exit' statements - what do these do?
supposed to end the script
as in, all of it
So I guess that's intentional
what about place_empty?
checks to see if the point given is free (no collissions)
hrm
let me put this in notepad so I can strip out some of the unnecessary things like the first checks
okay
tidiness note: since you already checked for < 64, if (xtest > 64) == 0 could be an else instead
I tried doing that, but my checker wouldn't let me use else D:
so I just put in a new function instead
wouldn't let you?
o.O
well. it said it was wrong
also, I'm certain you're missing two }'s, unless you just didn't copy them
like I said. there ARE 2 missing. but once again... my checker said they were wrong, so I left them out. and when I tested, it didn't error and close saying it was expecting a }, but it simply went into the infinite loop
really don't know what went wrong here ><
what language is this?
GML.
12tired
have you tried just running with two extra }'s anyway?
'w'
I can try. one sec
odd.
that made it work >.>
I've taken quite a few out and now the if (lr) == 1 and following while loops don't close
:P
the hell ><
whatever
don't always trust syntax checkers
now to bugfixing new errors
sure, NOW it says they're correct...
did you make any changes since that?
no.
then it's obviously being silly.
yes. that happens sometimes with this program.
always remember, if it says it's wrong, but by the most basic knowledge of the language it's right, then the checker is wrong
mmkay.
and by the most basic rules of ANY language, EVERY code bracket closes, no matter what. Brackets in string values are exempt as they aren't part of the code
damnit
Do you have the SSL port open?
Because I want to attempt a SSH tunnel
Hey.
I don't have it open.
I'm not 100% sure I can support SSL.
ah
Well, think I'll be able to still get in?
Not sure.
it's no wonder I hate my school internet so
hm
damnit
lost the installer
Installer for what?
OpenSSH
Ah.
I seriously can't remember how to SSH tunnel though D:
Been such a long time
I never thought about it until someone suggested it yesterday
eh, proxy bandwith is diminishing D:
eh
passwd file D:
bawwity baww baww
How is it set up?
Config file?
I'm looking at the readme
it's damn confusing

I'm trying to get in using an SSH Tunnel
so I can use mIRC instead of god-damn-freaking-CGI:IRC
hm
night
except this OpenSSH configuration crap is annoying me D:
i bet you could set up mIRC with Tor
wat
Tor..?
google it :P
k
it's an automatic proxy thing that is uber win
Also
it even works on our pcs
Go check HoR's admin board :D

slow download speed
not as bad as my home internet though :O

Lol, auto-tor blockers are win.
Onion skins get really annoying.

6LOL my conclusion is awesome
6I'm gonna type up about how we need a solution to the threat on democracy
7If a human speaks at an average of 80 words a minute, then my speech is 13 minutes long. O,i
7O.o*
6but also pint out that a college freshman student wouldn't be smart enough to decide a matter that serious
6point
6logic ftw
7Even if I speak at 160, that's still 6-and-then-some minutes.
02I wouldn't say "smart enough" kind of sounds like you're callin someone stupid lol
02But oh well, I'm not your editory 83

6no maximum
02I'm sure there's SOME maximum
6...
6college

12XvX ewwww

02I have a grey background
02I can't see your text unless it passes over the darker grey
sleeping on the ground seems to influence the numbers quite considerable
Oh. Is this better?
02Yes, thank you
^^
02Sorry for asking you to do so, I think I should just change my background instead...
02I just love it so much though D:
Lolno it's alright.
I understand :3
02Ya wanna see it?
did you know every year more monopoly money is printed than real money?
02Wow XD

Real money actually has value

12hmm
I'm going to join a Finnish forum :D
02Well, I wouldn't be surprised if there were more rabbits in the world than chickens

02I should ask Kat if she'd join my forums
12Ovo;;

did you know: If you see a statue in a park - a rider on a horse, you can tell whether the person died in a winning, a losing or outside a battle
02I think so
both forelegs of the horse in the air: Person died and battle was lost
how
12lol wow
one foreleg in the air: Person died and the battle was won
all legs on the ground: Person died due to age or other natural circumstances
12cool!
12Ovo
6huh, I heard something like that
So..what would hitler count as?
6but didn't know about the both forelaegs in the air
o.o
12XDDDD

Many birds have exceptionally good color vision, including blue. Often it extends into the UV.
My mom is more likely to crash than any other woman because she either, drops her phone in between the seats, pours hot coffee all over herself or gets distracted by singing songs that she doesn't know the lyrics to.

ok here it is :(
http://tinypic.com/usermedia.php?uo=Y%2FhLISduVV4%2FNhVkpYhOf4h4l5k2TGxc
6dawwwww o3o
?!!! D:
opinion!
6socute
3:
6wel lets see
X3 thanx
6it seems that you're following a stylized fur style
watchu mean
http://static.spore.com/static/image/500/490/749/500490749963_lrg.png
6which, in short, means some parts of the body wont have fur detail
6it'll be solid color
liek where?!
6like the legs, how you have them
6Nice.
i created my self ^^
oh so i did good there?
6and the face
6yeah
6Are those...rockets? o.=.O
yah ^^'
6but to be consitant
lol
so you dont think the random fur scribbles look too bad?
thunder blades
6you'd normally get rid of the fur detail on the main body
i tried i did!
hmmm i wouldnt no how
v.v
and plasma cannons on my head
6from the shoulders to the tail
6should all be like the legs and face" no fur
6Lol
and battle claws
oh wait.....
6Prime Definition of Pwn?
6lol
6except for the floof on the butt
*facepalms* im so confused! T-T
6hmm
6one sec
k
and yes rockets on my legs
6I'll do a redline
XD
hips
:o ok
and ur not the only one to do this so far on this pic
XD
6Still. Awesome.
battle armor
mana reganrator
and hp regain
6now keep in mind that this is ultimately your decision, as this is your style
6Nice.
6you can leave it as is, because it looks great
k
02;o
6http://img41.imageshack.us/i/redlineo.png/ but here's an example of what I was saying
^^ heh thanx
theres also pison blades
poison
6everything in the red circle would normally be solid color, very little fur detail
6because it's generally shorter fur than the nexk and tail
6*neck
^^ ok heh
bee summoning
i get what u sayin nao :
6the blue arrow points to buttfloof (lol), where longer fur grows from the backs of the legs, and fur detail is necessary
(aka fear)
*:3
ice storm
yeah
and some others
02^^
also u can upgrade weapons
6Nice.
6Laser Missile. o.=.o
example
the bigger the rockets
the more damage
6Ah.

6tan maybe
take over for time waves ok?

after malefors defeat
his crystal form

since eterinal night
6Ah. But DotD came out?

cynder resides in my dark citadel
i reside in the dark aged realm
6Ah.
/me does a victory dance
but cynder has never has the heart to attack me
and thus she will defend me in basil fight 2
6Ah. That sounds tough to beat...with just a Whelp and other dragons.
in the 2nd battle they will have the crystal daggers element
holy strike
6Ah.

04I mean, we are still paying for them, and we aren't using them?
13also iRage at doing ctrl + k because my script actually says pink
04lolwut
13Poison
10THAR
/me shot
10nah, it should be fairly obvious
/me shot
04lol
/me is drawing dragons
10omai
04I've had designs of these dragons for a while
04but I've never actually made proper art of them
10ah, nice x3
04And in fact, I've never named them lol
10well maybe time to give them names then o-o
04I named the dragon of nature Anticor
04Antico means Ancient in Italian
10i see
10why did i sort of predict that
/me shot
04lol
04And my parents are snapping at each others throats
04About us moving houses
10._;
04Bah
04it's only up the road anyway
10well then i don't see the problem but i guess they do
04Yeah
04Mum's angry at Dad because just since they sold a unit doesn't mean they should move so soon
04Quote
10for some reason i had to read that twice
10but ok :|
04Meh
04I hate it when they fight
04Because very often dad takes his anger out on us
04We get in trouble for the slightest things when he's mad
10damn :/
04It's not that bad if you close the door and pretend you can't hear them
/me hugs
10._.
/me hugs back
04Dun worry
04Drawing keeps me occupied
10Ah ^^
04And it's nice to finally talk to someone about this
04I've never told anyone about it
04But don't take this too seriously
04It's not like they hit me
10i didn't, but it sounded a bit :/ anyway
10that's all
04Oh well
04Do your parents treat you ok?
04I know it's a strange question since I'm younger than you
10It's ok and they treat me well.
10There's conflicts but that's mostly between me and them, normal stuff >_>
04Yeah same
04Just part of growing up
04...
04You know what?
04Some of my online friends seem to understand me better than my IRL friends
10Strange thing is i agree. And i've heard a lot of people say that.
04I don't know why
04Maybe it's because I can be myself here and not worry about being discriminated against
10Honestly it's because the internet = less personal/individual for me
04Hmm..yeah
10It's easier to "ignore" those who act like tards, and easier to get "private" with others etc
04Yeah
10but then again, if something goes wrong - it goes wrong
04IRL, they give you no peace, especially at school
04True
10typical "image given to friend, you get mad he get mad DURR image is on the internet forever"

04The name of the Dragon of Fire is Distruz
04What do you think?
10I think it's quite cool
10does it have any meaning or?
04Distruzione in Italion means Destruction
04Fitting for a dragon of fire no?
10Ah
10Yes x3
04Distryz is the most volatile of the 4 Dragons of nature
04Distruz*
10Ah
04He has the biggest temper, and the biggest rage
04He's also the easiest to anger
04Whereas Anticot
04Anticor* >.>
04He is the oldest, the wisest, and the slowest to anger
04However, once angered, his rage is incredible, second only to Distruz
04And funny, he's the biggest
02I am now back.
02which is amazing
02Now I have to change my nick on all 7 servers :D

07Ok guys
'-'
07If you were listening to a presentation
07and had this opening line:
07I, Maria Kathrine, could be a murderer. And I will, as you might expect, argue for my right to act as such.
07How would you react?
07lol
07>_____>;
14I would call the police :D
07Niau
14Sorry.
07this would be addressed to an audience who is pro-life; will ban use of abortion
07and I am pro-choice, and the goal is to convince people
07would such a line catch your attention at least? LOL
yes lol
O.o I'd go with a different start. It grabs your attention, but it also starts you off as looking like an evil person.
14Actually, no.
I think it works fine
07Hahaha I mentioned it to arrow, he found it somewhat amusing
On the spot?
Need a minute
07I'm struggling to take myself seriously
07LOL
07Ok
because if you think about it, so long as you haven't done anything, you're completely innocent
07Mm
14lol
Even if she did do something, I'd still consider her innocent.
Crap, she left 'fore I could post

/me 5Struggles and stretches his wings back before swinging them with force into the Drake.
-=showing my silverywhite fangs percing his armor with ease=-
2o3o
/me 5gives off a Piercing Screechroar as the fangs sink into the armor, piercing his skin and causing him to bleed. He begins thrashing his Razor-sharp wings against him, trying to find an opening in HIS armor, before catching a soft point.
12WHY?
2'cause they're so flammable
12O_O
-=biteing into his neck now hard and deep i smile at the attempts=- good..vulcan....fight...if you can..

/me is drawing art dedicated to Shiny
04But...
/me 5gives off another loud screechroar as the fangs sink in more and more. He Thrashes around more Violently now, Trying to Pierce the Hide of the Nether Drake, along with now starting to Swing his tail into the Dragon's face, the Tail-tip being used like an axe to try to piece through the Headplate of the Drake.
2o3o
12wow this is harder than i thought!
/me 5gives off One more Screechroar before his eyes start to glow a brighter Purple-ish red. He takes an Inhale of whatever oxygen is in the beast and exhaling, spewing out a Liquidized Metal down into the beast.
Hm?
12???
12Dang computer!

/me 5reaches down for his helm and pops it back on, remending it to his skin before glaring at him. He quickly snaps open his maw and closes it tightly around the Drake's head. He grabs the Drake by the wings and forces them down towards it's body before readjusting his Legs, lifting the Drake's body up slightly as he starts to slide him into his maw slowly.

/me 5continues to slide the drake down into his Maw, feeling the head of the drake almost touching the back of his Throat. He slickens up the rest of the Body inside his maw with his Saliva before starting to slide it down his esophagus. He takes notice of the wings slowly getting closer and compacts it into the Drake, making it fit in his maw as he continues.

/me 5gives off a few groans as he continues to push the drake down, feeling the Wings press against his Mouth, and soon against his Throat along with the Drake's Limbs. He pushes the rest of the Drake in, feeling it's head already down into the upper stomach as it enters. Now Upto the Drake's Hips, he continues to press it in.

12-v-
/me 5Pushes up the Drake's legs as he slides it in, pulling it in more until his maw adjusts to the tail base. As He continues, he feels his stomach start to expand in width on all sides. He start to feel the pressure and slides the drake in more lightly, now letting go with one wing as he uses the other to push in the tail.

/me 14screams and falls off his head
/me 5gives off another groan as his Stomach begins to expand more and more, noticing the buldge starting to appear. He slides the tail into his Maw more, almost completely devouring the drake as it pulls it in with his Inner Maw muscles and tounge, now letting go as he pulls it in completely, Salavating over the final stretch and swallowing the Tail end.

Fearsome alone like all dragons are but his species alone is a someone you best not mess with,He is cunning and very powerful,hes heavily armed with all the weapons, but he lacks defence,hes best in Stealth,you might find his jaws in your neck if cross him! he is insanely hostile if you piss him off.. and can indeed kill you... he prefers raw meat and blood f
from his foes! if you hire him he will get the job done....

hello?
:D ?
hi LL
Hiya guys
Yo nick :)
hi Roara
hiya o3o
hi
6comfy o3o
^^
/me cuddles Roara
6^^
6Ritz crackers and peanut butter = awesome breakfast
6especially when you're not feeling well
eh? What is it Roara?
6dunno
6my throat's all itchy and clogged up
6last night I found it hard to swallow without choking myself
6and I had a cough yesterday
6it's better now, but my throat still feels weird
I feel the same. Had some mint drops and a medical drop to get rid of it
6hmm
yet it seems to always return at night since a few days >_>
6med drops always make me feel sicker >_<
as long as they help, I'm fine
6true that
and I wore a scarf most time of the day
that also helped quite some time
6it actually felt amazing to walk outside, where it's about 5 degrees C, in my PJs
6although, my hair's wet now so I probably shouldn't do it again
yeah, not too good in fact^^
btw. Roara? your sketches are better than most of other's entire pictures^^
6LOL
6seeing as I sketch all the time
6I really need to do more color stuff
6also
6I find it hard to believe someone would sell sketch commissions for $45
6they're not even that details
6detailed
6http://www.goldenwolfen.com/shop/commissions/lineartsketch.jpg those don't look like $45 material :|
there're plenty of insane freaks on DA in fact
6I can understand some commission prices, like PearlEden
6he puts some serious work into coloring, lineart, everything
whew, I think I know some the entirely done pictures of those sketches
6but then you get to others like wildspiritwolf
but...45 dollars for just a SKETCH?
6they're so popular that they have no choice but to raise prices
and people are so dumb they gladly pay them
6yeah -_-
'-'
btw.: TOMORROW!

Hullo, Mistah TiemShift
6when's your flight?

07toomanythoughtsgoingthroughmymindthereisnospacebar
07so ya
I really hate leaving Devon
Nah, I think it's the colder seasons altogether that gets us down
that too, I'm never happy when im freezing but I miss my family and old home you know
Freezing? An Articuno? My mind is blown
went to all our fav places
grrr
I dont LIKE my habitat you know!
id much rather be in tropical weather
And yet you call yourself an ice burd
but I'm doomed to be in the North where I freeze...
that's because I. manipulate ice, doesn't mean I like the feel of it
No no no, you're supposed to be the avatar of ice itself!!
ommmmmmgggggg
not me
Well, I guess my OC isn't the only Articuno who likes warmer climates
^^
Well, that reminds me, do you remember that commission scenario I shown you?
I don't intend to ever leave my habitat though
which?
Hm...
Been to DA lately?
??
Nevermind
ok XD
Well the commission is complete if you want to see it, just look on DA when you have the time
I have time now!

03well, MSI Wind isn't *bad*, but you'd need to add more RAM to have it work faster >_
03*>_>
2o.o
i honestly wish she'd play a few lottery games....
2Credit cards are fail
then maybe we'd have a few dollars

03they mailed the check a month and a half ago

12Ovo
03I even called and complained
03and they said they're gonna look into ot
03*it
12omg

03Sadly, that's where I bought it >_>
12lolwut
03but, they still honor the warranties
03well

12warranties?
03and Best Buy only had it in red
03I liked the black one.
03Yes
03I got this "do anything you want to it and we'll replace it" warranty plan :P
12what is a warrant?
03LOL
03Warranties, like
03come with most products
03saying if it breaks within a certain amount of time, they'll fix or replace it for free

12(O)3(O)
03Yeah, for anyone who uses iTunes, they DO put your account name in the song
12LMAO
03so if you start sharing it around the Internet
03it's like, 2 seconds to find out who did it
03and they can easily just cancel your account
03or drain it
03or something
12Ovo
03therefore I have a little tool that strips all tags out, including your account name :P
12OvO
03(unfortunately, it removes EVERYTHING, including title, artist, etc... so I had to then put those back)

03I mean, they play music
03but so does my $20 Sansa
03so that's kinda an irrelevant arguement
03if you compare it dollars-to-features
03it's an obvious waste of money

6 8D

6when does he?
oo look a squirel XP
/me 6runs
This laptop would easily play l4d2
that was a..weird thought
2was a little afk just now
but in it's current state it won't
no workin fan
so it overheats easily
6wait, it has a name, right? i forget. lol
2okay
T.T
lol
just using this is making it burn up
lol
6I promise i'll burn it into my brain this time.
6tell me.
you have the lesser Dreadnought
6Ok.
2awww D:
your near warfang...
T_T
So I have 2 choices
6who? me?
the airship holds teliports to the 2 ships..
get a new one
or
replace the fan?
get this one repaired
2I would go with
get a new one
2get this one repaired
2XD
it'd probably be cheaper
just to get a new one
Alot cheaper
each dreadnought holds a dark crystal teliporter... in a way cobnnected to each light gem holder... the user can go to the very destinaion...
because some comp parts are expensive
2okay
and when they add up
6Now you tell me. x.x
to get this repaired costs more than the laptop
it is more expensive than a brand new one I believe
as in... the light gem u have you can go to your flagship at anytime... only dark dragons can use these teliports for escape reasons...
this cost me £380
its like my nether fade...
repairs cost £469
hmmmmm
f no
6Ah.
ok so who's up next?
6so i can teleport back to the ship at anytime using the crystal? or just from Ship To Ship?
correct
you may be able to get one that is better than your current one used to be
1st one
6Good. That would be usefull.
6If i can make that into a personal amulet...>>
lol
so i'll have to destroy that crystal
6Not wise, since you're collecting them.
yes... and vulcan will use a fragment to escape the area...
Yes?
dang it lol.
spyro in this gets more powerful with each gem
ok
yeaaaaaah
*whispers*
buy a new one..
>.>...
the light gems...
I intend to
when I get the money
6I'me like that Gnoll boss from TEN. I wont be defeated fully the first time. always retreat
so my elements get more powerful then
once you do defeat hias dreadnought or him self the crystal will not shatter bu peel off a fragment..
and vulcan will use the fragment to escape...
hi =>
02Done!
lol hi
spyro will collect the 2nd gem etc etc then moves on etc etc XD
ok.
so who posts next?
but theres 7 so... even i have 1... 1 from each form.. as in 2..
6Basil does i think...or you do, since you have to go to Warfang.
vulcan needs to edit his post 1st XD
04Done what?
6to do what?

7Hmm, Rora?
7Have you ever had the conception that you were not directing your characters in writing, but they were directing you?
6yup
6Esepcially when the character was made by someone else
6Aero's character here is really fun to work with
6for that reason
7Ever find yourself writing something that wasn't part of your intended path?
7But because of how the story works out, it continues in that direction?
6yup
04....
6that's how most of my plotmaps turn out
04What's a plotmap?
6I really need to finish SHY as well
6SHY was almost entirely done how you just said, quan
6minus a few thing si had to actually think through
7Hmm.

2QuickTime only plays, so does iTunes
03I always use Corel Video Studio

03it lags videos horribly
2o3o it plays

03that's my point
03it can't play its own videos
03like, it stutters and lags
03especially on HD
03when I can just decrypt the video and watch it in MPC fine
03yet another reason Apple fails :P

hi
My dog sleeps with his eyes closed
2oh, I've seen that, RN
i wonder what the new spyro will be like
though he sometimes rolls over onto his back with his legs in the air. Back ones spread wide.
2XD It was creepy, and she was whimpering and making running motions
2so I woke her up o3o
04So does mine but occassionally his eyelids open a bit and you can see the white.
Sorry am still here just trying to beat some stuff on fable 2
04Ok ^^
2o3o
Waking up a panicked sleeping dog is a good way to get bitten
2XD
04I bet bitten all the time anyway, haha.
2she just woke up, stared at me, and went back to laying down and started snoring
04I'm having to wear a cardigan to work tomorrow because of all the bruises. >> Still can't find the muzzle.
2LOL, she snores like a pig XDDDD
04Yet my dog is friendly and placid to everyone else.
04So does mine, haha.

2o3o XD
2my dog ignores everyone she doesn't know
6Hey

my dog doesn't snore (I think)
kinda hard to tell when he's sleeping outside my parent's room *cough*

2ooh. lol
2See, this is why you have to watch Soul Eater >:P
2oh, ok, Icy :3
6Flame Blizzard --> Meteor Shower? ovO
14Yeah, shadow is it. The only way to be it is if you're pounced or tapped with a paw.
/me 2eats the soul
2*smack* sort of dry
2Aurora wont be pleased if she's here lawl
2o3o oh
2if she sees you eating Soul *shoo*
2shot*
2I thought you meant *A* soul
2.....
2nope XD
fine!
2o3o Icy, that wouldn't work
6Yeah, but the snow'd melt into water around heat.
2the flames would melt the snow
6Or steam.
2and then the resulting water would douse the flames
2therefore making it a futile attack if you wait a few seconds =3=
14No Torching, impaling, zapping, or anything elemental wise.
2o3o
2Like my signature says on the TST forums, Ice/Fire = Freeze Burn.
14you can use them as an advantage, though
2o3o actually
6Well, steam can be painful
6But Ice burns by itself. Fire, too.
6Only, one consumes while the other numbs.
6</TPBoD> ovo
2Freezer Burn is an effect achieved by REALLY freezing your- yeah, what Quan said XD
/me runs tafter vulcan
2o_O
2and it feels like burning
2LOL XD My ice isn't made of water. It's dry ice.
2o3o hence, freezing burn -> freezer burn
2uh...
2that'd still melt
2XD Dry Ice is frozen CO2, I think
OwO
yeah it is
2yup, frozen CO2
6CO2 turns directly into a gas when heated; no liquid state.
2o3o

/me 14closes the door behind him and heads back up the stairs.

14Make yourself comfortable...i'll try to bring her down there.
6*comes in with the 42 units of notebooks*
anyway - caffeine will save my day
once again
6*places them on the table and sits next to it*
/me 10sits in front of the fire
that is about how many hours I get of sleep on the week nights
same here
6Man... that was some counting.
12well, the regular Melatonin is a 4 hour sleep pill
5-6 hours..woooo-.-
14There you are!
12TS, how old are you -v-
/me 14sits at the top of the steps.
and I'm not taking any pills just because I feel I might have done something wrong. Unless there's a "step back 20 years in your life and change everything from scratch" pill
14You were inside counting notebooks? still?
12XDD
lol
as I could use this very pill right now. That and only that
XDDD
12Melatonin has no side effects XD
12just helps you sleep for 4 hours lol
EVERYTHING has sideeffects
just because it's not told to you doesn't mean there're none
12not melatonin
6Yes...
It sound like its hard to resist taking it
6I rested when I stopped at 24.
12I take one every night and there is no side effects lol
6That's what YOU think.
12-v-
/me 10walks over to the notebooks wow
and - Melatonin is not available for sale in germany - because there ARE side effects in fact
6http://oddee.com/item_96885.aspx <-- ovo
12really!?
but i wonder how you would react if you didn't take it tommorow
6(it's probably the height of a Wii console)
6XD
/me sighs
/me 10curls up by the fire
6Or at least more than one feet. ONe and a half-.
12what are the side effects TS?
6XP
ya
they're in correlation with anti-thrombosis-medication and are able to cause thrombosis
/me 10yawns
what he said. :D
12what!?
Huh!
6Thrombosis. 8D
/me 6actually knows what that is.
12what is Thrombosis?
14Woah.

13D:
6Hooky: Mmmm. Is my lil'sibling done counting? :o
it's because they make a hell of profit out of it
6Hooky: *goes out of the room*
i knew he was going to say that.
/me 14smirks at the looks and nods.
14Why not head downstairs? Seems pretty dark and cold in here. The fires on downstairs.
/me 14nods and moves his head as she exits.
14Yep. He has alot of them. Lets go see.
did you know the industry in the US earns more on melatonin per year than on Aspirine?
XDDD
and yeah, they make really terrible commercials about them
/me 14starts to head downstairs.
12my melatonin has Vitamin B6
really?
oh, the vitamin each grown-up, average human needs around 0.2 milligram per day of?
okay want to try to talk about something else?
12-v-
the biggest LOL on Melatonin: "It prevents from getting cancer"
"prevents heart attacks"
"enhances growth of hair"
12--v--
That right i agree
"reduces the creation of free radicals"
/me 10falls asleep
Huh?
12---v---

/me 6snuggles Hooktail and then stares at Vulcan laying down.
12XD
/me uploads what's done so far
/me 14hops off before heading into a closet, taking off and hanging up his armor on free hooks, not wanting to clutter up the space. He heads back out, armorless, and jumps back onto the couch, murring at the warm heat from the fireplace hitting his scales.
14I hate Cyril season! >.=.<
12I doubt there is going to be a 5th generation if there is a God of pokemon in the 4th generation

/me 14scooches over to one side of the Sofa and curls up, taking up half of the couch now. He looks up at Hooktail and smiles, patting his tailtip against the empty side of the couch.
Damo thinks pokemon would never go away because their forever

6In the first RP we played, my friend sets in a world where Cynder already took over the world of the dragons. It was a very changing event, yet she let us live, if we (Hooktail and I) joined with her minions. After that was made, everything is different. The mansion may be still there, but let's just say it's very unusual.
/me 14gives off a sigh of relief as he sees a setting with more atmosphere.
12i wouldn't mind having that planeswalker as well
12jace something?
14Ah, I see. sounds odd already.
02Jace Beleren
12+2 each player draws a card, -1 target player draws a card, -10 target player discards top 20 cards of library
02or some spelling on the last name
12how much does jace usually cost again?

023 mana, and he's from M10 and Lowyrn
brb
12blah

6Hooktail hanged out with Cynder for their own discretion, and during the time I was female due to the fact that I was tricked by Cynder (shakes an angry fist!)

6"The mind is a very powerful figure... do not even let it overrun it's course into fearing others' lives".
/me 14grabs the cork of the vial before popping it off and spitting it out. He places his maw upto the rim of the vial and drinks it, all while staring at the crazed figure. He throws the dagger away once he was finished. He then looked at spyro.

2WHERE!?
6like I've wanted for 3 weeks
/me 2looks
my parents bought some for thanksgiving
2o3o
2luckeh
but they bought it from costco
6lol thanksgiving
always some leftover
well, for the pie
o3o
2XD
/me 6needs to expand her stomach this week
LOL
2o3o
6that's always the hardest part
i got stomach flu the day after thanksgiving.
2XD
which was kinda ironic to me XD
6because there actually IS an art to expanding your stomach
my brother wears sweat pants on thanksgiving
O-o;
6and it involves lots of water along with food
there is?
LOL
2XD
6there's a book or something on how to eat the most turkey on thanksgiving
2O3O
2well
2that won't help me
6...
2we have chicken
/me 2runs!
6"The average weight of a turkey purchased at Thanksgiving is 15 pounds"
6the hck?
2o3o
6I've never gotten under 20
6o3o
hck?
hck?!
6most people I know buy them at 20 at least
the average weight of a turducken is unknown to me.
o3o
6my friend is having her HUGE family over, and gave me an estimate of turkey lol
6three 21 lbs turkeys
O_o;;;;;;;
2o3o
even OUR family isn't that big
6which doesn't sound like much, until I remembered that they have all the side dishes and everyhting
6like.....50 or so people just in the area
2XD
we probably have that too
only
all over the world
or mostly in asia.
o3o
or osmething like that
i think i almost confused myself
6however
6I'm gonna expand my stomach not for the turkey
i also feel like i should be getting kicked for flooding o3o
for the PIE
6I dont like turket
2XD
6*turkey
i don't really either
6it's for the stuffing
6HOMEMADE stuffing o3o
2STUFFING
6nothing beats my grandma's recipe
2ITS THE BEST PART
/me stuffs a chicken in the turkey
2o3o since we don't have pie T^T
6and then you get the gravy
there be-eth your stuffing.
6TURKDUCKEN
2I am a "sad, deprived child," people ssay o3o
[23:26:47] the average weight of a turducken is unknown to me.
LOL
you are?
2LOL
2o3o no, not only that
6but it's usually because no one is still hungry for it lol
2we don't have pie. Ever.
2we hardly ever bake anything sweet.
6I've been called deprived a lot
6but recently we've just decided on "ignorant"

Hello everybody !
(If someone is there...)
ummm...not at this hour.
Bye then.
/me yawn
1310Alert fail *shot*
12he's tricking you D:
12he's secretly lurking
10Meep
10:|
1310meow
10I'm so mad right now
1310Aw D:. Why?
1310Unless you don't want to talk about it ofc
10The past few threads he's mentioned my name, saying I did something wrong
1310ah, i know what specific event you're referring to |3
10when nobody else mentioned it, so it's obvious he's bullying me
10I'm really going towards telling a mod/admin now, just to get him off my tail
10D:<
10Also, if you scroll down on this thread: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=2944.15
1310should be like online services, blist/block = they practically doesn't exist to you anymore
10Feather told this guy that he posted a new thread in the wrong place
1310no wait, then it would be free for them to behind your back etc
10LOL
10was**
10He god mods everything basically
1310i have to say LOL WTF at that example though
1310even i would react, most likely just by quoting and saying "wat" though
10Can't believe Kyu actually said he'd make a good fanfics mod
1310I'll disagree there.
1310I think that would work. At least i think :P
1310also TEAL TEAL TEAL
10well, as long as he ain't in charge of anything else, I guess it's fine
10Teal wall :3
1310Yes. All of it.
10But yeh
10if I need backup, I know where to go
1310lolwut
10you're my official witness
10I can get as many examples as I can as it is so
1310WELL yes i can say that it happened, but personally i've grown to disregard ANYTHING that people say/do to me on the internet...
1310with my youtube comment replies i have no choice
1310People complain about facebook spamming their inbox, well hah
2hai guys
1310Looks like Umbreon once again were right with his predictionz
1310zomg
/me shot
2SKYLANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10What do you mean, Xeli?
/me tackleglomps Skylands 'hai :DDDDDDD'
/me pokes Skylands to pm
2lol
10Oh did he?
10I didn't notice
1310before your arrival even.
10Ah
2XD
2Skylands ftw
/me is shot
/me uses cosmic powars to foresee a !greater fail
2Xeli: no u
what it means? :)
2uh..another meaning for hug?
10'Glomp' is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a hug :P
=^.^=
10not anything sexual related, though
10some people get confused by it's definition
thanks for translate =)
10:3
1310So, a glomp is pretty much a tackle-hug.
1310Whoo
10It's in the japanese Wiki page
10which also has the definition of "kawaii" and "desu" etc
1310don't link me there
1310a wiki allows everyone to edit, so that's a wise decision |3
1310If that counts as +1 i start having quite a lot.
/me is shot
10I don't think it's possible for Xeli to be a spazztic
10tbh
10maybe if I bought him an Espeon plushie it might be different
2xD
2thats why Skylands ish ftw
/me pokes the silence
2!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!"
2XD
/me glomps Skylands
2Skylands ftw
4SPLIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
2wake up Kyu, rise and shine
/me pours ice water on Kyu's head
10Hmm
10I wonder if Kyu is really awake, or it's a script
2Kyuz0rz
10My friend from another site is coming of teh chat

2I dare him to whine to Arti about it
10He whines to Articuno? lol
/me refuses to accept other time zones
there is only GMT -5
10Timezones are completely fail
How are they fail?
10Just because it is
No.
I disagree
=D
So why are they fail?
10Timezones fail because I barely see some of my other friends online due to their different one
That's it?
2fail Timezone is fail
2xD yeah
10The only time we ever talk is if I wake up early or stay up late, or he does it
/me sings

2oh, okay
10meh, lame
10>_>
WOOHOO! TEACHER CONFERENCES
2LOL
10But the annoucements said the whole point of a student coming is for them to help you prepare for what job you'll get after high school ends
/me always had fun at them for some reason, hearing the same critismz repeatively
/me beats Skylands with the lugia
2D:
/me uses protect on Skylands
10I'm most likely going to university (or college, whatever you want to call it), so I guess it's necessary for me to go

6now that I'm getting better with art, those powerhouse arts don't look as godly anymore
6some do, but others actually seem "reachable" to me
03I wish there were more meaningful people here, instead of people who just say random nonsense 50% of the time
/me hides
1XDD
12drf
12if you're looking for that you're in the wrong place
03That's why I'm on more than one network

03as in, the kind that determine if you're smart enough to stay at the university :o
03But I think I have solid Bs in those classes, so it shouldn't be a big deal
02I got classes like that in my major drf
03well I mean like, chemistry
03why would engineers need to take chemistry unless you want to do chemical engineering?
03They juts do it to make you fail
03same with calc 2... I took calc 1 in high school, they just make these super hard
/me rubs his legs
02ah, I understand what you mean now.
03as in, an A- is a 55%
gah, they hurt....
03on a test
03that's how hard it is
02yikes, 0_0
the minimum for A is only 55%?
typical A-levels 60% is VERY low for achieving A
03No, it varies per text
03*test
03but we all failed so hard they curved it
03like my 33% was a C+
03they make the calc exams so hard nobody gets above a 70 really LOL
the damn staircases of the cathedral yesterday...
6o-o
/me waits on VMWare
03also, Mac OSX can't tell time
03it's worse than Windows
02my Calc 2 professor doesn't like to test what he teaches, and he is also very vague in the questions he asks, and he doesn't curve either. My calc professor during my last spring semester curved up so the class average is a C (late for this post maybe?)
03o.o
03well it's not up to the teachersx
03our classes are all taught by graduate students
03the tests are written by the math department
03they really have no say over our grade, LOL
02ouch, and I haven't been taught by a graduate student yet, although some of my friends have
03I don't mind... they just don't have any real power
/me nods
03so this has been 16 minutes remaining for 5 minutes
03jeez
02hehe, laptop battery?
03No
03Installing Mac OSX inside a virtual machine.
03Basically, there's no way to decrypt iTunes 9 videos in Windows, you have to use a Mac ><
03And the ones our school has are too new, iTunes 9.0.2 breaks Requiem, and what good are videos that can't be decrypted?
02I wouldn't know.
03I'm good at this stuff :o but iTunes 9 suckls
03-l
03worse than the rest
03and it forced me to upgrade in order to buy this video >_>
02I have a 'simple' kind of MP3 player, never even touched an iPod or iTunes before. What video was it?
03Fairly OddParents: Wishology
03I wanted it in HD
02okay
03LOL now it's at 15 minutes
03That was some major progress :o
AERO
/me rolls over

and bye Ecco :(
hi Lugia
1310I remember that as well.
1310Now as you said it xD
12let's debate on something funny
12does water exist?
12yes or no
6hmm
6depends on how you look at it
Heya nick ;>
6but as it can be broken down
6then no
6it does not ;)
1310water...
6it is simple two hidrogens and one oxygen
6*hydrogen
1310i think it does. But it's a combination of something else ah aurora beat me to it
6also, who here learned H20 as hydrogen dioxyde?
6*dioxide
6because that's WRONG
6o3o
6most schools teach it to be called "hydrogen dioxide" when in fact, it's "Dihydrogen monoxide"
6most high school students, when they learn that finally, have trouble grasping it at first
1310well, Hydrogen Dioxyde would be 2 oxygen and 1 hydrogen so MIND = BLOWN
6yup
6I've always noticed the difference
6but never knew what the real name was
Not chemically possible
Hydrogen only has the capability to form one bond
1310Hydrogen only have the first "shell" of electrones or something
1310 I REMEMBER learning this
1310so theres ONe space etc
Hydrogen only has one electron, which is in the first shell. It can either give its electron, or accept another to form precisely ONE bond
I thought my photo was up in the college gallery and I was like omg they put my pic up!
Though I suppose it could be a hydrogen-oxygen-oxygen chain
but I look on my camera's memory card and they obviously removed the image from my card onto their comps
><
which, I suspect, would promptly disintegrate from 2 HO2 to H2 + 2 O2
6ew
6c;ass
6*class
6bye all
HI
The wirless network here is angry today
xD
10I see
1310Failnet fails |3
10Winnet wins
1310And that is all.
12uh oh it's art
12hi
12Hi!
1Hai Arti~
12how goes arti?
Hi Arti
/me bothers Articuno
/me bothers Articuno more
12Thanks, even though I asked you not to >v>
XP
12Joke or not, it makes me remember all my outstanding work and then makes me feel under pressure.
Sorry
12S'ok
/me reidles
what youy talking about arti?
k, I just heard the most ridiculus recipe ingredients....from france
if you want to make a cake, take EXACTLY 2.6 eggs! not 2, not 3, EXACTLY 2.6!
1310that sounds sort of complicated...
/me hops on Articuno's back :3
... why not just increase everything else in proportion to use 3?
because then it wouldn't be a french cake anymore!
12Because the french are idiots
/me runs
/me high-fives Arti
lol :P
well I gotta go now, otherwise I'll miss my bus and thats the last thing Ill be needing today
bye all
12Eep ok seeya soon
urgh, my thighs are killing me x_X
12Still!?! LOOL
I had to stand in the train yesterday for two hours in fact
plus the Jet2-seatings aka thrombosis-seating...
12He was
yeah, next time I'll fly there myself
12XD
12ans hi
12*and hi
Heya ^v^
my cat is annoying >w>
lol, it feels good to be able to download a 12GB file and say "Hmm... should only take about a week" XD
12GB?
heh, week
around two hours for me :)
/me crawls all over arti
/me cannot, however match that
12showoff
12:(
k, a friend of mine would get it - if the server allows to - in 20 minutes^^
>> Well, normaly it would have taken me a few months, so I can't complain ^v^
university broadband internet connection ;)
I can't take the battery out
torrent for Nightwish discography (2.8 GB) has taken 29 hrs so far, at 97.6%
lol... well, lucky you then
oh yeh - I remember a competition. What's faster: Our provided internet or a mail peadge with a memory card on its foot?
apparently the peadge won ;)
>>
Yes he did, lol
12yeh I showed Lugia the video and article
and the internet transfere wasn't even at 4% XD
if memory serves
Ah, meeps, Arti, may I PM? ^^'
/me sits all over Lugia
07hai
/me dumps a 500KG bag of cookies all over Kyu
heya ^v^
07oof
12of course Lugia
07but that means you dropped the bag on yourself too o3o
well, I really should get a pilot's license asap :)
07and a plane?
I'd prefer having a two-engine hydroplane ;)
you'll never have problems finding a landing site ;)
07lol
And yes Kyu , that is true, but I am not complaining ;>
07^.-.^
you'd have a little trouble over the Sahara
if possible, even with a cargo hold to put a car or at least a motobike into
With rising fuel costs it might be quite expensive, with added airport taxes, though, you can skip those ;>
/me welcomes the over grown pile of mobile floof
a Consolidated PBY would be an epic win in fact^^
/me gets a floofbrella
/me rolls
look at this
07Hm

07Nopes

Still looking at pics, but I would love to see a video ^v^

we need more guns here though
hey Xai
pssst
12Video is now on Facebook
05you know how you were saying we have loads of cctv cameras

not hard to find guns we know that lol
12You have to put the volume up to understand me.
05(reading your journal)
we figured out how to legally carry a handgun
I'm off to class I'll get on Mibbit when I get there
yeah
ttyl
cya bro
/me heads to face book
05you do know that in the UK we have almost a quarter of all the CCTV cameras in the world
I also heard you have lots of hauntings. If there was gonna be a zombie outbreak I bet it's gonna happen in Britain.
07Lol.. you and zombies XD
well, I knew there were quite lots of them in the UK - but not that many in fact
I also herd u liek mudkipz but that's beside the point.
05http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html
05yeah, it's rediculous considering we have higher crime than most civilised countries
10by spyro
I always find this technology funny. The much I'm a lover of anything being very advanced, I prefer talking and working with humans over working with machines-only
well then - you need more cameras!
05i know what you mean. damn automated telephone answering machines
12LOOL
wheeeee
05press 2 if you want to talk to a person....alised message
05press 3 if you want to hang up and start again
05press 4 if you want to kill me
those automatic answering machines guiding you to the right agent...I hate them and at the office we found a very effective method to bring it into failsave-mode and put us through immediately: Sing a song for it!
press 12 if you require assistance
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8YKfsIIG0 <= Red Vs Blue on answering machines.
05loooooooooooool
02Java sparrows!
/me likes how the video he semi-quoted was posted 2 seconds after
To mark this message as "urgent", press 11.
"Sorry, but I did not...sorry, but I again did not....I'm terribly sorry, but I seem to not undestand you. I will forward your call to the next agent. One moment please"
12XDDDD
05that is awesome
worked for me every time. And as the system itself makes plenty of forwarding mistakes, it's not even blasting the statistics ;)
so it's raining where i am
nasty
btw. wow, I got a note of my bank. The 50 GBP I got from the ATM really were around 55 euros - almost no fees
12Wow!
12NiceQ!
12-Q
12gh

12i
that's awesome

07fdsjflskdklfjsklfkd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12Of what?
hey vulcan
07LALALA FISHSTICK FAYAAAAAAAAD
hey vulcan
12:D
12I wonder what fayad means
an ATM with a GIANT sign over it "withdraw money without being charged ANY fees" - I put in my card and the machine prompts a message "you might get charged a fee for withdrawing money"
12LOLLLLLL
6How come it's alive so long /today/?
Actually
07LOL Arti do you still have that recording?
It's possible that you get charged by your bank for withdrawing
07Arroooooow
Not the machine itself
12Um
Happens here anyway
12Banks do NOT charge for withdrawing here! XD
07LOL
07Articuno, for me, if I go to ATM machines that are connected ot my bank, no charges
07but if i go to machines belonging to other banks
If you use an ATM that isn't owned by your bank, then yes, they can charge you here
depending on where you go here, SOME do
07then there is a small charge to my withrawal I think
Yeah
14Dont know...maybe because it's a fun week? :3
Same here
07Same as arrow
07..
07argh
It's completely free if you use your own bank's ATM.

10its sparx fault
(Cynder) Tell us what?
/me 14sighs once more.
(Sparx) WHAT!!!!
/me yeah its stuck to the wall in your room!
*he's*
(Cynder) Finds sparx & growls along with ember in attack position
14Sparx got stuck in the wall here. Spyro came to us for help to get him unstuck before you got back. We decided to help try to get him out. We flew back here and tried to figure out some way to get him unstuck...
14Ladies! Please listen....no need to get all hostile...
14Calm....yourselves. Let me finish....
(Cynder) Spyro, U & your friends aint leaving along with sparx
07rah x.x
07Me and zombie games + low self esteem = blar
(Spyro) cynder please calm down, no need to fight.
/me gulp! whispers *hey dark vulcan i can teleport us out of here if we have to ok*
/me 10whispers whispers do it now!
14Spyro came up with the idea to get Grease in order to slip him out. We tried that, nothing worked...then we ran out of time when you arrived. Our final attempt was to paint him and blend him in with the wall...obviously his perverted mind ruined the whole thing...
(Cynder) i heard that & uses a fear attack on all of the male dragons so cant escape
(Sparx) HEY!
/me sighs on Skylands
/me NO! >.< too late
/me 14gasps and ducks out of the way of the blast.
/me contaigously sighs back
/me 10doges it
14Hey! I was the honest one here! Dont blast me!
(Spyro) OK lets calm down we tried to get him out.
I didn't know sighing was contagious
/me also dodges it barely
/me hey cynder take yo anger out on sparx not us!
(Cynder) Spyro come over here.
10It can be
10just like anything else
Pfft
Slapping isn't contagious
/me slaps Skylands with a large tuna fish.
10ya blame it on sparx
(Spyro) GULP! (Cynder) Y didnt u tell me? (Spyro) Cause u wouldve killed him.
/me avoids
/me throws the tuna at Altair
(Cynder) Looks at sparx how much did u see sparx? looking angry
/me 14sighs.
ember was embarrassed
/me eats it :D
14Judging from his giggling...just from the time you entered...to the time you caught us.
/me 14gets up and slowly walks over to ember.
/me XD he is so dead now
Darn you people are good.
10we might be dead 2 you no
/me 14stop and looks at them.
/me ....didn't we dodge that fear attack?
14Why dont you guys have any backbone?! C'mon! Be a Dragon....
(Sparx) um everything, but spyro & company were listening too
10i am a dragon!
/me wth sparx!
14Yeah, because it was Spyro's intention to bring us back there to check up on you.

/me nods
Hmm

10i am telling the truth
14Then good...
(Cynder) ok i believe u guys but if u guys say anything on what u heard sparx say when were undressing u guys r next
urgh - on a pain-scale from 1-10 - with 1 being completely painless and 10 in almost unbearable pain, my legs just critted with 19 x_X
(Ember) YEAH!

/me 14nods.
14My maw is sealed...
12I'm suffering from seperation anxiety.
/me also nods
03o.o
That sucks
(Spyro) cynder u know i'd never do that
oh yeah
03See, being in a relationship completely destroys your ability to function as an individual -_-
and well - the stairs from yesterday
12Actually Xai is right next to me
12Retard
03Not like I'd know, but I've seen it plenty of times >_>
12I'm talking about my friends
10wot?!
03see, having friends...
/me runs
03but seriously, you've done that with Xai too
03so meh
12Yeh of course, that's just me, not relationships
12I like company.
03XD
03But I've seen that in other people too
03like some of my IRL friends
03who want to do everything with their girlfriend, and act completely different when they're alone
12Yeh ever figured that maybe YOU'RE the disfunctional one?
(Spyro) whispers at vulcan hes dead
03No. XD
/me 14nods.
12Well, you are. HAHA
03OK...
(Cynder) Well?
03so, I gotta email Woot.com about this mp3 player I bought...
10wot?!
03I got it and the screen has scratches all over... that's not what refurbished is supposed to mean :/
/me 14looks up at Ember, looking at her for a brief moment before Looking at Cynder.
I already know I'm a malfunctioning entity. Yet the spare part to be replaced within me is to be invented I guess
10i was trying to leave but nintendo grabbed my tail
(Ember) oh hes dead as she tells vulcan
10WtH
/me 14nods, trying not to smile.
and lol Arti - I seem to have simply talked this giant-lugia-selling-girl against a wall
12Eh?
12XD
12Paste logs into a PM?
(Cynder) no do u promise not to say a word about us? in a calm tone

10i already have a bad reputation
She: Er, i'm considering $5,000 offers and above, but still not sure x_x()
Me: not sure about what? and besides - if you want me to pay that much money, I'd want to see you and the plushie live and directly. I'm not transfering that amount of money over the net
She: Heh heh, only *considering* offers over 5 grand. You'd be the third person in desire of it.
Me: well, if I was - why isn't it sold already ;)
She: I'm still not sure to sell ^_^ I might not take $5,000.
Me: well, so what use is it to bid on something you won't sell anyways?
(Cynder) cause if u do i will find u.
12Lol!
12Moar?
(Spyro) nods thats my cynder
10great another enemy
that's it til now
lemme see how she'll try to bend herself out of this
if she says "I might not take 5 grand" - I'm fine with paying less ;)
12XD
(Cynder) U mind if keep sparx, spyro?
maybe we should make some kind of reverse-auction
(Spyro) No i don't (Sparx) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

14I'm Judging you Ladies will Teach him a Lesson on Being in the Wrong Place at the Wrong time?
I'll bid -100?
(Cynder) Oh we will (Spyro) feeling bad for sparx. (Cynder) I'll make him forget what he saw
12Instant win LOL
4Isn't a chat room a terrible place to be?
4To RP, I mean
03sigh, stupid college kids
4becuase you never know when a conversation will strike up
o-o
03My roommate has this friend over talking about how she has all these Facebook pictures of her doing stupid stuff, and how her mom's gonna kill her
03Whose fricking fault is that?
I actually bothered to come on here at school for once o.o
(Cynder) kisses spyro on the cheek & says ok u guys r free to go except sparx
o-o
12HAHA
14True, but there is no RPing room like this that has the ability to do something like this.
LOL
4It is called....
03yeah
4Spyro Games! Make a topic
12WHY WOULD YOU DISPLAY EVIDENCE OF DOING STUFF YOUR PARENTS WOULD KILL YOU FOR???

03Well obviously someone else took the pictures
lol
031. Don't go to parties and be drinking when people have cameras
03in my case, omit the last part
/me noms Skylands
4not so much
4if you do it right
032. If you do, own up to it
its fun
03Haha "You don't know my parents, guys... they're so overly protective"
03MY parents are overly protective. But seriously, underage drinking? That's ILLEGAL, her parents would be SMART
10when the roller coaster starts i cant get to thee switch in time
4Adrenilne shots ftw
lol
10but even then its hard
/me wakes up from a wet
vulcan u want to keep going?
O-o nap I ment
10brb
14Sure.
underage drinking is okay under certain conditions
03is it just me or does people's roleplaying get completely inapropriate and uncalled for after a while?
/me hides
well actually i have to head to work in a hour
wut?
03and meh, I'm just completely against drinking
03it tastes like liquid p*sswater, why would you drink it?
03You may as well just directly kill brain cells, it would get the job done quicker
i'll be back at 9pm eastern time. so maybe we can chat by then
03and I mean the whole wet naps, wet bunnyfoxes, etc
03it's just annoying, and wtf is the point besides sounding inapropriate?
later vulcan
14Ok. Later. :3
depends on the drink, some are quite nice
03such as, Mountain Dew
/me runs
/me loves rum
12yeh and pepsi
03I seriously just stick to soda
03Exactly XD
03though, ew cola
03I don't like Coke/Pepsi/Sam's Choice Cola/whatever
12Drinking is for people who don't know how to have fun without some sort of "aid" lol
03but just about any other soda, I like
03Yeah
very true Articuno
03my idea of having fun is like, play video games
07LOL Arti
/me runs
but one or two drinks help you relax
03artificially though...
thats the way i see it
12Maybe when you're as shy as you lol
lol true
12I don't need to take drugs or anything like that to relax, I'm just too awesome
03Me too :)P
lucky for you :P
12lol
03Darn mp3 players
03I installed Rockbox and it won't start >_>
oh yes Arti. You're saying a true word :)
lol drf. It just means I'm taking a shower
03yeah but it sounds totally wrong :o
a friend of mine, a younger girl (19 or so)...well...she regularly goes out with her friends, just to the park, grab alcopops or cocktail-drinks, beer and stuff and drink it there...
they have fun just by drinking...
03yeah but that's not real fun
03that's just messing up your brain
12I know it's so totally wrong of me but I don't actually want to be friends with anyone like that,.
yeah
03Me too!
03Though one of my friends is like that, I'v emade fun of him a few times
03He's all "I'm never drinking again" and gets drunk thpe following weekend
03this is now the 3rd time he's gotten drunk since we moved in
if I should want to kill my brain cells, I'll simply hold it into a fusion reactor. That's quicker...and maybe I'll even come to enjoy it
03and he's like "no I'm serious this time!" and I was like "you know... the wolf just ate that dude alive when he pulled that"
o.o
/me stares at his inbox.
12What?
hmm...
There is nothing wrong with a few drinks with friends. It's just binge drinking that's bad.
12We never said there was something wrong with a few drinks.
know what I drink when I feel I want to RELAX? Like when I'm not able to sleep?
12But people are ALL about binging now
People who drink to get drunk are just stupid.
12Yeh but thats what everyone does
...No they don't?
12Uh.. what rock have you been living under?
I grab a cup, fill it with milk, put it into my microwave oven, warm it up, add two spoons of honey and drink THAT!
03LOL
12Ever been out on a weekend night??/
03I can never drink right before I go to bed
03otherwise I wake up at 3AM having to pee
I don't, my friends don't.
I hate parties
03Me too
03I've always wanted to DJ a party, but I hate GOING to them
03since I don't dance, and it's just boring otherwise >_>
12yeh but you're 14!!
well, that way I wake up about the right time to really get up :)
12and you wont believe how many 14 year olds DO
once you're an adult you'll see what a mess society is
03LOL
Some people go over the top, I never will. I don't plan on getting drunk.
12I kinda wanna know what 14 year olds are doing drinking with their friends anyway.
03well luckily in Troy, people are generally more mature
PEPSI
03I don't think we had any pregnant girls at my high school in the 4 years I was there
they've brought a small boy into emergency room about two weeks here...2.4 promill alcohol in the blood...
03but tha'ts rare, apparently
the boy was 8
12Omg AGAIN this morning in the metro, "England is Europe's biggest binge country" as if we havent heard it enough times
03wtf, I figured Ireland would be
12lol
don't get me started on the media
Was the report authored by a 'Capt. Obvious'?
lol
They repeat because most of the viewers were drunk and forgot!
12you would with the stereotype, but it tends to be adults who drink loads in Ireland, yet it's EVERYONE here
/me flees!
03Heh
I didn't say I drink with my friends, occasionally I have a small glass of wine or something with my parents. What I was saying is that there's nothing wrong with people having a few drinks with their friends (when old enough, obviously :P).
03but seriously, I hate when people are all "You're just sissy"... I mean, who said college was about getting drunk?
03Just becaues they do it in Animal House...
12Lol I mean the 14 year olds
12who do
03that movie was cool, LOL, but then people try to base their lives off it
12When I was in YEAR 7, people were going to clubs..
12In my class.
ugh
12I was 12 then
12LOL
03I just like listening to the live broadcasts from the clubs on the radio :)
drf - you should see university's here
03because I like that sort of music
12Frikkin unis >v>
03LOL
03yeah I know

12I HATE uni students, inc you Andrew LOL
03I mean, University of Michigan is pretty prestigous, too
12Im gonna go to bed now

03it's not like a party school
03but yet... it is

6I've gone almost 5 months since a problem, but it finally decided to be obnoxious like that
O.o 5 months?

6I messed up my ankle back in 8th grade
6that's kinda what happened to me
eww
6it's not nearly as severa
6*severe
6but the same basic concept
6I was told to stay off it at home, but that didn't really stop me
6I never let it heal right I guess
6so occasionally, it'll just up and decide "today's a good day to make Aurora's walk miserable"
gah, you two seem really to be the same somehow...
6lol
at least from the stubborn part :P
6I had to do speed laps in swimming today
6and it started hurting from all the kicking, and I just kept swimming

6the fan/hater population just needs to chill
02I'll be thinking on how to redo it. I appriciate your opinions Aurora!
well at least I don't think Edwards hott!
7o3o
I don't like vampires too much. I don't like lovestories too much. I don't like crappy stories written by a mormon retard. So twilight is a triple-fail to me
6no prob ecco, I'll be waiting for it
/me jumps off the building getting blown 20 feet away from asplosion from solar beam D:
7My gosh, Time.
7You're a bit harsh there, eh?
6at least I don't think a book character with no proper picture is hot, yes
they put werewolves in it
am I?
srsly HOW original in a vampire movie >.>
I'm just honest and straight
6that was harsh indeed
ok
here's the truth
6religion BANNED from this channel
7Sure, adding 'crappy' as an adjective makes it all better.
3I was recently playing pokemon mystery dungeon Explorers of time on the computer
6even a mention like that
/me stuffs Garlic into Edward's gob and shoots that Werewolf guy with a Minigun loaded with Silver bullets

/me prefers bad vampires

6she wrote it on her own accord, someone got wind of it and turned it into a trend that spread like wildfire

mm?
6"the" story?
7Ah, Aero. Love that remix. :3
=)
/me likes movies with complex storylines. VERY complex storylines
/me 7listens to it in WMP
6and that's fine
6so do I
i need to think about pokemon and it's awesomness in order to chill
3?me to
7Feh, then KH's a game for yo.
/me 7flees
7you*
6KH just as horrible in my opinion
O_O
6but I think that was the gameplay
7Nya?
I loverz KH
6but then again, merging all those disney movies was weird too
for an RPG, I built a character story once....the entire background of the character itself almost a novel
7KH 1, 2, CoM, 358/2, what?
3ya
02Kind of creative, yet odd
7Unless you've played V-cast or something. O_o
I love the Tales of...series
and that was just a character to be played on an RPG-Ultima-Online-Shard :)
/me 12coughs
7Sora does sound like a Gary Stu involving all of those Disney characters, hmm?
6Quan, I played KH 1
6it was horrible control
I love complex storylines too, even though I might get confused for a few moments xD
well then, I'm in bed now
seeya all
7I've played 358/2; the only problem I have to say is the camera.
night
6night
and sleep well everyone
3with the computer on you?
7Oh, and no reaction commands, lulz, but that's beside the point.

7So, how's the controls bad, Rora?
12bye TS
3XD
7O_o
/me 7ducks!
12lol
well, they are bad on KH1, but they fixed that on KH2, but not by much
6it was a mix between control and OVERrepetition
3XD
6to the point of it being excrutiatingly boring
7KH's a hack-n-slash.
posted :P
6excruciatingly
7You're supposed to button-mash.
7Like how you have to do the turn-based system in Pokemon.
what about me?
12hmm?
/me was hacked?
12what?
7No, Aero, I mean the game genre.

12did you read my fic?
6sure?
6what on?
remember the weegee army?
XD
14yeah.
3On my computer
7Okay, there's supposed to be this battle at the part where I currently am. Thing is, I don't want to flood this section of the fic with how the battle goes, since its events are unimportant; just the results are. So, the question is; how much should I explain the battle; a little, and go on to the next section, or more in-depth?
6 2 	Aurora 	[28047] [14770] [7418] [22224] 72459 	 "ok....now it's time to start floofing this essay" I have no remembrance of this remark ._.
3XD
12Ovo
I play platinum on my computer
6hmm
A DS IS A COMPUTER.
6I tend to explain every movement of a battle
3more in-depth
6but not in a ragged way, make it flow
[18:45:34] <%Aurora> 6 2 	Aurora 	[28047] [14770] [7418] [22224] 72459 	 "ok....now it's time to start floofing this essay" I have no remembrance of this remark ._. <-- Floofing... An essay?
when 2 weegee stares collide....
12XD
6battles are wonderful places to type out some awesome movement details
WTF!!!!!!! booooom
6as I said, I don't remember it .-.
(I swear if that's my random comment I will LOL hard)
7Yeah, Rora, but it's unimportant, really, but it's part of the plot.
who the heck is weegee >.>
3no! I downloaded an emulator which allows me to play Explorers of sky which i downloaded on my copmuter
6OH
12cool
6the battle itself is unimportant
12I have soul silver

6hax HAX
/me 6is waiting for the real game
12Ovo

03I've been trying to decrypt Fairly Odd Parents: Wishology for like, a couple days
03Yes.
03VMWare is the program
12XD
03VMWarez is when you don't buy it
/me hides
XD
12XD
I have VMWare.
03but seriously.
Wait.
03Yeah
You have mac.
Wtf.
03No
03I have Windows...
Theeeeennnnn why have VMWare?
same
ugh
o.o
03Why not?
03So I can run, like Windows 2000, XP, Vistrash, linux, and more :P
03And I just got OSX working :O
12XD
Well I thought it was to use Windows in Ma- Ah.
03but that was part of my project to decrypt these files
03It's seriously annoying me
So you DO have mac XD
03It doesn't WORK properly
12vistrash OvO
12XDDDDDDD
03since Apple is evil and makes it so you can only use OSX on an actual Mac
03I had to get what's known as a hackintosh
Lulz
03a hacked CD
12I have a vista XD
Owwwww my tongue
03And then I tried to update, and it died
/me fans
Windows XP > Vista
03Yeah, and then 7 > both
7 >>>>>>> Vista
Windows 7 > Windo-
/me is late
14I don't know what I have
12Im going to get one for X-mas XD
03oh
03OK

03er, DVDs
12XD
03I got one free upgrade with my laptop
03one full retail copy for $30 through MS Store
03then 2 copies of Ultimate from the school store $20 each
14give it to me
03Plus the free one I got from MSDN AA
/me 14needs an upgrade
03No way LOL
03Well
03the 2 Ultimate's suck
03they're literally upgrade only
03I tried it in VMWare
03and it didn't accept the serial
03and that's just stupid
DRF
03but, FYI
03Anyone with a .edu email address can get Windows 7 Professional for $30

02So go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat a friend. Do it in the name of heaven, you'll be justified in the end! There won't be any trumpets blowing, come the judgement, on the bloody morning after...one tin soldier rides away
o.o
/me blinks
poem?
02Close
02Song
after I make apple sauce :3
ah
nice
02Listen children to a story, that was written long ago. Bout a kingdom on a mountain, and a valley down below. On the mountain was a treasure buried beneathe the stone, and the valley people swore they'd have it for their very own.
022So go ahead and hate your neighbor, go ahead and cheat a friend. Do it in the name of heaven, you'll be justified in the end! There won't be any trumpets blowing, come the judgement, on the bloody morning after...one tin soldier rides away
lol
nice
pretty good
02So the people from the valley, sent a message up the hill, asking for the very treasure. Tons of gold for which they kill. Come an answer from the kingdom, "With our brothers we will share, all our secrets from our mountain, all our treasure buried there."
02Now the valley cried with anger "Mount your horses, draw your swords!" And they killed the mountain people, so they won their just reward. Now they stood beside the treasure, on the mountain dark and red, turned the stone and looked beneathe it. "Peace on Earth" was all it said
02Oh the irony :D

>_> yep casual gamers suck at picking good games thats why the wii is still being flooded with crappy shovel ware
which would be appropriate for a babyfur like me I guess :P
6Amen.

02your journal, sorry for your drama about what happened to you, :(
Oh, no biggie
It was only one pic that I had back in February
02can you link it please? I'm curious to see it.
great to use for throwing it at the idiots who bought it in the 1st place heads lol
Was only $5, but I was kinda annoyed by how the artist immediately felt "insulted".
02perhaps it's not good to talk about what happened here
02^^;
XP Worst part was she admitted to drawing it without a referrence. Anyhoo, worry not. I won't give names, but I do need to look for the pic.
2X-x urgh

'fore you say it
14lol
/me goes to speak but stops
Yes, it's good, but it's inaccurate and not what I asked for.
/me was gonna say "cute picture"
It's like.. say you asked for a picture of your mom, but instead you get a picture of your aunt, as great as the Mona Lisa. :P It's good, but not what ya asked for.
2since she DID give me the inspiration I needed
2and I have an hour 'til my mom'll force me to bed... o3o

02I think you have to trash all these bosses or whatever
02Xemnas is really fun
02he's so much harder and awesomer than KH2
04I thought it was Critical mode and use nothing but the Kingdom Key
02I still don't know why they didn't make him like that in KH2 -.-

02Emotions do NOT belong on the internet
04Too bad

10Before using the t-word
02wat
02I had permission, if that's what you're asking
10x-x and i just said that would be good to say first

10but most of the time it's not bad and :/
/me pushses himself to post his FF on HoR
04That would force me to be active
02how so?
04I would have to post my FF chapters, and I would then post in other topics
02lol
04And first chapter posted
02Drake
02you should also draw on the oekaki and go to HoR's IRC more often o-o
10YES. The oekaki is awesome.

02now bye
04Cya
13and cya
04Reading
04Bah
13D:
04You don't mind spoilers do you?
04Because I could use your help
13Don't ask me, i'm sort of writing something but i shouldn't try to help...
13and i don't mind spoilers
13Ask away ^^;
04Well, you know Lyon's friend Radiel from the Prologue?
04possessed*
13Mhm
04I'm having trouble thinking of when Lyon meets him for a confrontation
13I can't help much there i'm afraid :/
04I want it to be after he defeats Calasi in the Fire Nation
04But before the rest of the Elemental Lords meet up
04Basically, Lyon moves to the Fire Nation from where he is now in the story
04He travels through the towns, realsing that civil war has broken out
13That sounds reasonable, that's all i can really say
04He travels to the Capitol, fighting rebel soldiers and strange fire fiends along the way
04When he reaches the capital, he meets up with Ruby and several soldiers still loyal to her
04He notices that Calasi, the counsellor, is the one leading the rebel forces
13hm
04He engages in combat with him, but he is defeated, and only lives through Ruby's intervention
13I can't see the problem here :/
04Realising that he needs a weapon powerful enough to break through Calasi's dark armour, Lyon travels back to the Dark Realm
04Along the way, he encounters Radiel, who is possessed by now
04Radiel exchanges several words before parting
04In short, Lyon travels around Elemaris helping the other Elemental lords aquire their nations ancient weapons
04The thing is, after that I'm stuck
04I don't know whether to have Lyon face Calasi along the track of gaining the ancient weapons or have him fought in the Fire Nation again
04And after that I have no idea how Radiel fits into this
04Any ideas Xeli?
13i don't know really
/me sighs
04I have to go anyway
04Bed
/me huggles Xeli
04Cya
13but a more set-piece thing (as in not meet randomly at path) would be cool i guess
/me huggles
04Well, while Lyon travels around Elemaris, the Fire Nation wages war against the other realms
04Maybe they could encounter a force lead by Calasi
04But I'm not sure
04Anyway, we'll speak tommorrow
04Gnight
13Ok
02DAMNIT
02PRESEA

Was cycling on the road, and this bus was right behind me
07oh?
07o_O
So I like, turned my head back to see if I could give way or if the coast is clear
And then I saw the bus' LED display read, in big glowing orange letters:
07LOL!!
2o_O
2LOLWHUT
07So early xD
Indeed XD
07but thats pretty sweet
And frightening at the same time XD

Yes yes, but when I say SHORT I also mean young and out of place

07In fact, it concerns a minority
2oh..okay.
07A warning to you all: Stop talking to me about my relationship with Arrow. After some insistent interferences from people who really can go and shove it and floof off elsewhere, I'm sick of people rushing to conclusions.
07So.
07Fair warning to you all, and I reserve the right to shred anyone to pieces who doesn't respect that :>
07things are fine, and it just boggles my mind how people insist that
07things are arrow's fault
/me is tempted to be ripped to shreds
2okay. point noted
07so there's the background for it x3;;

hihi
hi2u2
Winamp's auto-tag is correctly recognising one of my albums as bootleg
Yay?
10(again)
sets the album name for the songs to "Wishsides (bootleg)"
which I just find hilarious
ty
I am now in english class
exciting
How's it know that, Horo?
I have no clue
perhaps this is a very common bootleg so the tagging DB has some programming to for a particular identifying part of the data
Hullo. '-'

Instant Ramen
Yes or No
they sleep most of the day then spend their waking hours getting so high that they freak if they see anything that isn't: a) a eucalyptus (sp) tree, b) another koala c) the ground
</pestering>

6I sorta have time now, I guess
/me 6pulls it up
12just check the pokemon tcg thread on tst forums
12i pretty much posted all over that place
6I think it would be nice if redshark had actual images of the cards
6makes it easier to read
12i know what you mean Aurora
12that's why i downloaded over 2 gigs of card scans of magic the gathering scans
12i think the last place that tried installling card scans though
12with a card program got badly busted by nintendo
12they didn't take too kindly to that idea
6wow arti's connection
6it's eating itself
lol
12i guess when arti is hungry
12there is no stopping her
02ello Arti
wow.. brb, rain

I'm always tired, eight hours doesn't work for me
I just need to keep up with my iron supplements
I will be healthier then
oh by the way, we're getting gym membership as soo.n as we gef parking sorted
someone may be renting us a space for 70 a month
My iron levels are good. I get tested :>
ten less than our last space
12hi sis :D
aww why?
07But hey gym membership is cool!
07can I PM you?
absolutely
I'm still waiting to find out if I get that job... if so, I'll get exercise traveling there.
10Hi Pokestar
eat more banana then Arti. There's plenty of iron in them
2-4 weeks to go!
/me sighs
12i'm getting back into posting in the forums
I don't like them
12but i'm irritatated at the fact that over 50% of whatever is posted is either roleplaying or forum games
there are vrry few fruits I don't like
that's one
banana is a vegetable
well then: More white beans :)
12i think the reason i stopped forum talking in the first place was because i ran out of stuff to share about myself
you got PLENTY of those in england^^
12now it feels like barely anyone is having decent convos :/
Horo: Banana is a fruit.
hey, I'm always trying to get more discussion details on Lugia on the forum :)
it doesn't have seeds though.
It used to.
12but i don't like talking about lugia
so it -used- to be a fruit
The banana is a very artificial plant... it's been selectively bred to be seedless.
Yes, I've seen the video :>
A wild banana and a domesticated banana have little resemblence.
6lol no
12i don't like lugia
6XD
12:(
12the lugia person yes
6I love lugia, but not everyone else does
12he's fun to pick on with his funny lag
the video is class
12but the pokemon is completely over-rated :(
err...
6over-rated to some
6but for those who genuinely love him, no
-question +answer
is this some evolution video about the banana?
6I loved him before he was cool :P
who carea what others think of Lugia???
12i know
6exactly
6all I know is how I feel
6 3
6<3
Lugia fans tend to really be fanatics.
I loved Lugia even before most others found out about him being there
6I guess I could be considered a fanatic
6^^;
Horo: It's a famous video of a creationist speaker argue that the banana is just so convenient a fruit it must have been deliberatly made for human consumption.
6loooooooooool
He is half-right... it was deliberatly made that way. By over a thousand years of selective breeding.
you're not as fanatic as I am Roara :P
got a link?
12hmm
Nope. It's on youtube though.
12i will say one thing though
sick bird, don't type and ride bus
12out of the 3 original legendary birds
Along with a 'why do we laugh at creationists' video pointing out the flaw.
12articuno was and still is my favorite
Lugia is one of the few pokemon I can make good art of.
12moltres is pretty nice looking as well
As I have a model to use.
07Ew lugia
07sorry but I'm not that much of a fan :P
12zapdos
12darnit whree is that picture
07will respect those who are, so that was a purely 'me' statement LOL
Zapdos is too pointy.
12give me a second
6he's just amazing as is
Zaptos is nothing else but a giant flying hedehog
6he's a hummingbird T_T
.-.
/me 6hugs the spiky hummer
Moltres is rather hot though. (Insert cheap cymbal sound effect, commance groaning)
07[18:37:15] <Vyl> Zapdos is too pointy <- I really love him

hello?
Hummingbird looks vaguely annoyed.
/me hmms
12the irony in lugia
6indeed
12is that i like dragons
12which lugia somewhat resembles one
6I don't see lugia as a dragon
6but I-
6.
6yeah
6I can see why people would relate the two
hello
12i still find ho-oh better though XD

If so, I can show you this: http://vyl.avians.net/Blue_Bird.jpg
12yes
12Ahh.. a bunting?
I have no idea. I came across it on a p2p network.
6painted buntings burn your eyes
12Looks exactly like a bunting *googles*

6bye al, class time
12I can't believe I've been at work three months now..
12Well, just about
12I also can't believe I left my other job over a year ago..
12and that this time last year, I was visiting my parents first time after I'd moved.
10gtg be back like in 30mins see ya
14ok, cya later
Two weeks until I may or may not have a job now :>
12How can they make you wait two weeks? Sheesh
No, they are making me wait four to six weeks.
12...
Because that's how long it takes for the CRB check to run.
12LOL
And they can't formally consider me for the job until that is complete.
12It took two and a half weeks to sort mine AND I hadn't included my documents when I sent the form first time
It's peak time of year.
Schools try to hire all their new people this time of year.
Save the embarassment of having to ask students for directions :> And allow time for the initial training.
I had to wait 19 months for MY job initially...
so - stop complaining everyone :P
12Yes but didn't you have a job at the time??
no
12What were you doing from 9-3 all that time then? lol
sleeping long, being online quite some time, going out, searching for a possible alternate job, taking care of my mother (who was at the hospital due to cancer), getting to learn all the housework to do, going to several different trainings and courses...
and sitting depressed in a corner
Hello!
hi you
10.-.
12ahh right, so somewhat similar to me when I didn't have my job lol
12Hi again!

Heya TS :)
12Yeh?
i little gross, but i was wondering about it
ive noticed a lot of peadges missing feet or toes, Tier says that its a disease that they can pick up that causes them to loose feet pieces...is that true?
12Um, yes? Why?
o.O ok i didnt know
lol
Not sure Arti
12Ok ;v;
theres a few around Plymouth miising feet and i was curious
poor things

Joking anyway you guys will be the first to know if i get a new comp
sry skylands i am going to go catch the bus, i'll be home in a while
it looks really good for a kids movie
It's based on a childrens' book, so don't expect there to be much worth seeing other than the costumes and effects.
>.>
EEP
/me huggles
it's not really a kids movie that much o.o
i mean it is but.. isn't
lol
and i liked it personally a lot

it has FORT BUILDING which is epic
12I'm gonna add this album link to the main site now, sick of pasting it around
but it was by no means happy lala

/me floofs

/me 14smirks, having a good time even though his life is on the line. He continues to run.
(Cynder) growls. & uses her poison breath at him.
07Articuno, the youtube link
14Hey! I was Kidding!
/me 14tries to dodge.

14She did...until i persuaded her towards me. ;3
I didn't know what you wanted to put it
in*
I'm using CGI:IRC
which doesn't keep logs
/me good idea as long as your in there peeping oh wait nevermind BAD IDEA who knows what vulcan will do
and I closed the window
*not*
14Heehee....Why should we?
02You did know I wanted it in because you said you would, but I can understand that you forgot
14Picture yourself in Her Scales...would you like it if you got turned down by the Male you always wanted, EVERY single time?
(Sparx) its just sick, its like cynder & spyro cuddling
Shiny, I have limited time
and I have restricted access to that at school
so I couldn't do it
/me >_> thats her fault for stalking him continuosly after the 1st reject
I was going to do it at home, but I didn't know what you watned
02What do you mean?
02I already said what I wanted you to do last night, and I already told you that I figured you forgot
(Spyro) um vulcan not the time to talk about this, then points at cynders presence resting on spyros shoulder
anyone seen my new forum signature?^^
12LOL
(Spyro) i'll be back going to take cynder to her room.
14Oh right...still the spark of Jealousy between the 2 dragonness....
I said
that I knew you wanted me to do it
but I didn't know what you wanted me to put on
I herefore declare my home and my collection as Lugia reservation 01
02And I said
02That I told you what to put on
02But you must've forgotten
yeah I did
anyway
yeah
LOL
where's Altair and Xeli?
(Spyro) walks cynder up her room.
02Don't know
02And atm, I don't care
/me 14sits, waiting for Spyro to return.
k
and by the way Shiny, you should appreciate what they do to help HoR
/me *looks at sparx* you better not go in her room again cause we won't get you out next time!
02...
Altair has set up an Oekaki, an IRC and he's also in the process of setting up a new forum for us when we get a domain
02So now you're sayin that I don't appreciate what they've done?
You sound like that
02Now you're putting words into my mouth?
02I'm angry NS, right now Idc where others are
I know
02APPARENTLY NOT
/me oh thats right i was suppose to electrocute you *grins*
02Because you're saying that I don't appreciate their work
But there's some times where you sound that you don't appreciate them a lot
02So I have to show it every day?
02I have to tell them "Thanks for doing this" every single day?
No.
02Then stop it NS
14Hey...NF....
(Sparx) HUH? not again
02I AM appreciative for what they do
(Spyro) Hey im back
/me yes vulcan?
You sometimes sound like you don't, which is what I'm implying
02But you know what? I am not in the mood to even care where they are atm
okay.
02STFU
02Quit putting these damn words into my mouth
Shiny, stop it, and calm down.
02NO
02You think, I ain't appreciative? If it weren't for them, this site wouldn't be the way it is. I'm thankful to all of them
02Tbh, I've told you how useless I felt compared to them!
02And you think I don't care?
14I dare YOU to go on a Date With Ember....x3
14since you hate it so much. :P
o_O you better not put that in the show!!!
I have an epic Guitar Hero video I want to upload but I can't with this laptop D:

I know you care
But seriously, stop taking all your rage out on me
14too late. >.=.>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qucFNMDNEOA
Even if you're angry, try to calm down
Emotions don't belong on the internet
02Don't freaking put words in my mouth

just stop it, okay?
that's a music video from the movie^^

02>.>
14I aimed it at you

10(it's your picture with less tinypic, Shiny)
02LOL thanks XD
02Yes
02I plan to add all the beasts in there, but I have to think of a way to position them
/me 6eats Quilava's k :3
10It's kinda hard to add more, since Ho-Oh and Raikou take up alot of space
02Yeah...
02But I'll find a way
10perhaps Entei could be seen behind Raikou, using Flamethower on a fire place
02o3o
10o3o?
02I laugh now, because I was JUST thinking that I should put Entei behind Raikou
10and the fire place idea too?
02No, that was new
02But a bit ago I was thinking of adding a fireplace tbh
10Suicune can be the reindeer
/me runs
02Fffff
02I was thinking that too D:
10Last night I had a dream about Hamtaro
/me misses that show so much
02It's Hamtaro time!
02Kuchikuchi kuchikuchi ku!
/me flees
10Another good show that was taken off of CN..
02All good shows were taken off CN or made horrible
02One Piece for instance =3=
10It was on way before I got those channels
10but my grandparents had cable back then and recorded it just for me
10by the time it was 2004 when we got a satellite dish, all those good shows disappeared
02Sounds like what my grandparents do for my cousins
BREAK THE SILENCE!!!
02*gasp* !silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!"
/me flees into his hole, buries himself from Sky's rath
02wrath*
10I see no silenve.
10Oh, my rate of typo's lately have been SKY-HIGH
/me shall use Entei and fireplace idea o3o
6i've missed TST too much :(
hi Touri
wb mii
Back
10Anyone heard of s ahow called Scare Tactics?
10a show*
/me glomps ^v^
J!
Hai ^^
02Heard of it
10I'm watching it on Sy-Fy at the moment
back
Heya ^^
02Why in the world did they change their name to "Sy Fy"?
/me eats them
i can not belive it
Who tabbed me?
Your mum
10o-O
10Hai
10Hi.
Good, original joke.
.-.
10No clue, Shiny
10I'll Google it
:P
.-.
02It used to be "Sci Fi" which makes more sense than "Sy Fy" :/
02Look what you did! *slaps Sy Fy*
10._.
10o
/me tailfloofs on Kyu's nose.
/me flees
Yes?
uh hello
06tab'ed
ok
hi
06hai hai
10Blah, that annoyed the heck out of me.
10o-o
10Anyhow, I found the answer
10that change from "SciFi" to "SyFy"
10They wanted a name they could trademark and make more money off of..
10http://scifiwire.com/2009/03/sci-fi-channel-to-become.php
02Lol, of course
02Btw Sky, since you mentioned a fireplace, what should I put on it?
10Lol, profit
10Sci Fi is a legitimate abbreviation for science fiction. Sy Fy, although it may sound the same, just looks pure lame.
10imho anyway.
10Also, how is changing a name going to make more profit?
4hy
i have had a bad day
10'cause it's new.
02They won't be stuck to doing only Sci Fi o3o
10or something.
4y
02Like how Toon Disney is now Disney XD
10and it probably doesn't cost them much.
10Yeah.
02So they don't have to stick to cartoons
10I read some other people's opinions when Googling Sy-Fy and said alot of people did NOT like the change
02My mom and I don't either
4becaus one of the moderatiors locked my club i think
10Same.
12Is it just me or are the internets FRIGGIN slow tonight!?
10I just think it's pointless
10Sy-Fy looks gay either way :/
they are
Both.
There slow
02Looks stupid*
12lol
12What the hells going on then?
4her
07Cube hacked the internets
Dunno
07the whole internets
he hacked them
because of me
D:
10Cube doesn't have a confirmed gender, Touri

/me runs

03I just don't see the point
03You make a profile, with the intention of SHARING things
03then put private stuff you don't want anyone seeing
03mark it private
03WHY USE THE SITE AT ALL>?
2lol

03If you're gonna upload naked pictures of yourself, at least use like... Google, so people can find you and stalk you
/me hides
I don't even use social networking sites. :P
03I only really use Facebook
/me runs
03it just appeals to slightly less social people
/me runs faster

04Hey NS
does anyone here do mIRC scripting?
03They fixed my server
03and left the proxy intact
03of all things
lol
03they got rid of my music, pictures, videos, everything
o_O
03but left the fricking proxy...
>:P Not less social. Just socially challenged.
:/
03and yeah I do mIRC scripting, why
can you help me with this please?
03yeah
03and ... LOL fail
2and hi NS
03You need to enter your password to change preferences
03I'm ALREADY IN MY ACCOUNT, FFS
03God, I generally hate new things
lol
http://pastebin.com/m17c11b35
can you fix that?
03new versions of Office, WTF
03New versions of FileZilla, WTF
03Windows 7... Cool. Usually, meh.
I know it should be on not off
but it's causing problems
so yeah
03o_O
03What are you trying to make?
03that's a LOT of {}s
oh
A colour script
03also
03you can next
03*nest
and which certain channels that don't have colour
03if ($chan != #nipponsei | $chan != #x10Hosting)
03Something like that
03for example
03on *:connect: {
03if ($network == HoSHiNET) {
03join #pokemon-originals | join #tv-temple | join #disneyunvaulted
03}
03so I think the | is "and"
okay
/me changes his entire profile to "everyone"
I'm on laptop
03Er, security wise :P
2gtg now~
2cya guys~
03also wtf at line 2
02sorry
03Maybe just do inclusive rather than exclusive?
02uh
02I'm on a LOT of channels
02I have 11 IRC channels open, drf
03and you need color on them? >_>
02IRC servers*
02yah
03For that matter TST is the only server I've ever seen that allows color
03generally you'll get banned
03... wtf servers are you using LOL
02or can I put
02servers in?
03Um
03I don't know
03but I want to test something
03hold oin
03*on
02lol
02k
03Ok, that worked...
03I added a second one for #Test
03Test
03Yep, works XD
03on *:INPUT:*: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt }
03so they go in order, top to bottom.
03now what I want to see is
03if you can do a !
02?
03like on input !Channel
03if you get what i'm saying
03test
02ah
03... XD works
02wait what?
03wait no
03on *:INPUT:!#Test: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt }
03That just makes it never show blue anywhere
02so what does that do?
03... I hav ea theory
02hm
02I have an idea
03so do I LOL
/me 6paints the Golden Gate Bridge gold
02my script is like
02on *:INPUT:*:{
02if (/* !iswm $1) {
02if ($chan != #z) {
6stupid names
02what if I changed $chan to $network?
03...
03Just hold on a minute while I try something.
02okay
04Bah
03Test
04Would anyone here request a drawing from me?
04Just our of curiosity
03... fail
04out*
6draw me ^^
/me 6runs
04lol
03what I was trying was
03if ($chan !=#Test) {
03on *:INPUT:!*: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt }
03}
/me pokes his journal entry
03whatever the case is don't mess with iswm and stuff
02hm
03just leave the whole color script alone
02Well
03but theoretically you should be able to put it in a conditional
02I like colour ):
03that's not what I'm saying
03hold on, I'm still testing
02well
03...wtf
03this doesn't work either
03if ($network == HoSHiNET) {
03on *:INPUT:!*: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt }
03}
03that works for my startup script...
03hmm
03Odd./
07yes.
07yes you are.
/me flees
03LOL
07what are you trying to do? o3o
03mIRC scripting.
03on *:INPUT:#Test, #blah: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt } <-- So that works
03putting commas and just listing channels.
07but what specifically
03custom color script, dunno
03it's not for me >_>
02hm
02well, drf
02would doing servers there instead work?
03Don't think so
02okay
02well
02whatever
03AHA
03I FQIGURED IT OUT
02?
03on *:INPUT:#Test, #blah *!=#DRF: if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(3),12,$1-) | halt } <-- That'll do colors in #Test, #blah, but not in #DRF
03... LOL
03hmm, it won't do colors anywhere else though.
03:< faiul
03-u
02lol
02well
02that doesn't really help, does it?
02crap need to go bye
02bbl
03Nope. XD
03LOL I'll work on it anyway >_>
03boredom, mainly
07on *:INPUT:*: {
07if (/* !iswm $1) {
07if ($chan == #CaliClan) { /say $+($chr(03),07,$1- ) $+ , deshou~ | halt }
07}
07if (/* !iswm $1) { /say $+($chr(03),07,$1- ) | halt }
07}
07o3o
03... wtf?
07nested script o3o
03but wtf at deshou
07because XD
03do you seriously have it say that on every line?
07yes.
03LAME
07yes I do, deshou.
/me runs
03... LOL
03I tried something but it locks me out of every other channel, hm
07lolwut
03ah I see
03I said if channel isn't #test to halt
03LOL
07XD
04Hey

03I fixed it but now it's giving black text
04Does anyone know what console MH2 is on?
/me yawns

/me hides

03Ahh, figured this out
03on *:INPUT:*: {
03if (/* !iswm $1) {
03if ($chan != #blah) { /say $+($chr(03),10,$1- ) | halt }
03}
03}
07color for everything but that one channel?
03Yes.
/me puts a washable tattoo of a zebra on Kyu's forehead.
03I'd imagine you could put a bunch in there too
/me washables that tattoo
07XP
03like if $chan != #blah | != #ABC, whatever
03but that's not for me to figure out :P

/me fails trying to find a good humanities class to take next semester
03I want to take "Intro to film", but I can't FIND it anywhere >_>
6blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
6this animation project needs to be scrapped
Try a class that exists. owo
03LOL
03It exists.
6too much for my inexperienced self to handle
03I just can't find it in the thing
6eh
03you have to browse by department, and "humanities" is not a department. :/
6perhaps it's not being offered at your school
03...
03I saw it listed in a course guide
03What I can't find is the course guide
6yeah but, it might not be offered
03Like it was a physical book, at the guidance office
03I want a PDF version
03nah, I'm sure it's offered
6like, my course guide shows water polo as a takeable class
6but they don't have a teacher, therefore it's not offered for now
6it does that for alot of classes
03ah "screen arts and cultures"
03LOL
03:( I think it might be full already
6that sucks
6I gotta finish my class scheduling this week
03yeah
03what other humanities would I take?
03Registration for me opens the 11th.
Look one line below.
03So i gotta do it soon
6if my payments arent in by then, I'll be dropped from all of my classes
12he always says that lol
/me opens his incredibly crude Excel spreadsheet
03... >_>
03I could fit it in my schedule but it'd mean having 9:00AM classes 3 days a week
03I don't like getting up early :(
6lol
6I've got that
03I've slept through a good deal of my 8:30s
6 4 days a week
03See, if I go with the green colored math...
03the reason I have two in there is my mom might not want me taking a Friday afternoon class, since it makes it really hard for me to make it to orthodontic appointments that way >_>
6this term is going to be so leisurely for me
03LOL
6I need more stuff
6but this term's list of classes is rediculous
03well I dunno, right now I'm barely passing my classes >_>
03... hm, I need 236, not 290
03... No way
Hi
03there's a lecture, lab, AND discussion?!
03That makes it super hard to fit
6LOL
6HI
6funfun
6hi
03like my gajillion chemistrys this semester
6meteorology ftw
03LOL
/me 6mumbles something
6no chem class o3o
03I'm taking all weeder coursesa >_)>
03*>_>
03Well, for engineering majors...
6weeder?
03weeder, the ones they design so people flunk out of the university
03calculus 2, and chemistry, are the two most failed courses at the school
/me 6utters a metallic screech
03so I dunno if me having a C+ is a good thing...
03I'm not FAILING... that's good I guess
6*flees*
6why are you taking them? o-o
6Um.
03they're required.
6ew
6lol
03Yeah
03next year is when the actually relevant classes start
03well there's engineering 100 and 101
03I'm barely passing 101 as well >_>
6I'd like to get my terms on track for the transfer
6but
6the next time I can meet with a counselor about that is AFTER registration
03also ... ew, the lab for this class is Mondays from 4-7PM
6so....kinda sucks
6ewwwwww
/me 6is being ignored
03I wanted a schedule of like, 11-5
03that would be idea
6sounds like my 6-9 polisci class
03*idela
03*IDEAL
03LOL
/me 6is frustrated
03my friend has German twice a week from 7-9
6AA, sorry, but that's not the way to get attention
03and he hates it
/me 6is annoyed
6we're having a conversation, obviously
/me 6is mad
6and I said hi
6drf, I have spanish
6I'm dropping it
/me 6is very angry
03XD
03I get 4 free credits from Spanish.
6I'm supposed to continue next term, but no
6 5 credits here o3o
/me 6screeches
6easy A
03Engineering majors don't have to take a language, and I get 4 credits just for taking a placement test
6What
6I'm just so darn bored in there
03so instead of 16 humanities credits I only need 12.
6a placement test?
6wtf?
6GAH!
03LOL, it's not boredom as much as I can't understand a fricking thing they're saying
6you got credits from that?
03Yep.
03only engineers though :P
6>:|
6well...
6GOOD FOR YOU
03if your major requires a language, then no.
03X
03*XD
03My friends got 8 free
03from German
03that's half the requirement!

"Scientists who were not involved in the study are cautioning that the new species is not a truly synthetic life form because its genome was put into an existing cell"
4[censored]
Yes, but the DNa is manmade.
The DNA isn't alive by itself though
Why are they so reluctant to call it a true bacterium?
True.
It was apparently created out of parts from different cells
huh...
i did a report on genetic engineering a year ago
It's not completely man made -- in order to make something completely artificial, you first must create the universe
there are a few ways of doing it
I guess by definition it wouldn't be, since it's just filling in a prexisting gap with a new kind of pavement. :P
*preexisting
I'd probably consider it the first artificial life if they created it entirely from nonliving materials
such as introducing a bacteria that injects its own dna into another organism like corn
Anyone would.
As a minimum, I mean
So something like this doesn't qualify
It doesn't qualify, I agree.
It's just that they seem so reluctant to call it that, yet the actual biologists who created it say it is the first.
5Until science advances all artificial life is based upon another life. Computer artifical life will come before biological artificial life
Well, I'm still impressed, whatever it is :D

Wow wth.
Some of the stuff on this site is too strange to be true.
Such as jellyfish...That actually live forever.
._.
Is that possible?
It says that once they reach maturity, and get to the point where most things die, they revert back to being a baby again.
They're essentially reborn perpetually.
It's sick.
No way o.o
"Millions of years ago, the first of these jellyfish was born, and somewhere in the ocean it's still living today"
link to the article?
Well, what happens when the jellyfish is eaten?
Well obviously they can die.
I doubt one would survive million of years.
Without being snapped up by some sea turtle.
*millions
Damn, I hate the things that bring up related stuff.
Made me read random articles for the last 2 and a half hours. XD

Xbox Live sucks here too
there aren't any ethernet ports near the TV we have the Wii on
get a 100 ft cord then
I want one of those anyway
I'd trade you mine
it'd be easier for my 360 too
But yours is too short
not the blue one
I'll bring my blue one
it's like...
And it's also kind of broken
20 ft?
the plastic things that hold it in broke off
oh yeah
Still works though
that happened to one of my short ones
Yeah, about that

Hahaha

Except I get there waaay early

I want to keep the job into the school year
Hopefully they'll let me transfer
you goin to school in your home town?
No
ah
haha, you could work with my friend who works at this one
more like frenemy
but yeah
transfering may be a problem if the one your wanting to go isnt hiring
Yeah
Or if they don't like me
<.<
they hired a high school drop out last week
they'd better hire you
haha
we had a manager (a freakin ass) that spent like 3 years in our walmart when his walmart was like a block away from his house and they wouldnt let him transfer
I called Country Kitchen today and they haven't even started looking at the applications yet
of corse thats a manager's job
so that's a possibility
now that you mention that i am hungry now

mine is decent ever since i cleaned mine to put a safe in
without looking for someplace to step
all my bags from college are either on the floor still packed or their contents are everywhere
My room has random clothes lying everywhere

I agree with your argument
that person sounds very immoral the way they say that
I couldn't understand anything in it for [censored] so I have no say
Hehe
Hahaha
what
It's hard to argue morality, because at some fundamental level, you have to have an opinion simply based on itself and not logic
Yeah, I've had that problem in a lot of internet debates
It's kind of like geometry -- there's a point where you can't define things anymore, and you just have to take it like it is
yeah, I can see how that would be
"It is what it is because it is what it is because it is what it is"
morality is fuzzy logic
:P
So is geometry :3

exactly
they're just confused because they didn't have it as YOUNGIN'S

you really wanna be called that?
I dunno, I like it
XD
Sounds too much like facebook lol
that's true
so it'd seem like a social networking place
Hmmm
or it'd seem like a space-themed forum if we added the "forums" part
spacebookforums?
Lol, yeah
XD
well, it's an idea
I'd just go with Spacebook
I was just making fun of facebook and myspace
o.o
unless you want the forum part lol idk
it's only an idea
not for sure yet
lol
I'd prefer something that's not like facebook
Or any other existing website
true, originality is good
...but I can't think of anything
maybe we'll think of something this weekend
yeah right
we've been trying to think of a name for the past month
but maybe an inside joke will be created and we can name it after that
www.placebook.com <--- somewhere where places can get to know each other :D
XD
/me stares at the flashing gif
"HAI GUISE I'M WEST VIRGINIA -- Turnons: RIDIN THE APPLIASHIN TRAIL, LOL ;) Turnoffs: GAY PEOPLE"

Very suspicious

/me runs
._. / :D
12I also made http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?pos=-971
lol
03see, that time it didn't resize Firefox
espy just claimed you forever ns..
12Because I didn't link it full size
03o.o
03your gallery is weird LOL
/me prefers direct-linked jpgs any day
12Yeh but my gallery protects from image theft, you can't direct link without the watermark
did you mean: http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=970&fullsize=1 ?
03it has a watermark even in the gallery
only in imaginary units of time
03gaaaaah that resized it
lol
/me fears twiwolves, and invincible bears.
03oh, is it because it's usually a popup window?
o.O
no joke
12LOL
loltrue
12yes
yes, chrome lets you copy popup URLs :P
03ohhhh
03so like
Also The Matrix is seriously philosophical
yeah...
03you know how to make popups?
03I needed help with that
I watched part of it in IPT
12http://www.lugia.us/gallery/wm.php?pid=970&mode=fullsize you could always do that
espy decided that on #4chan
and holy hell it messes with my head almost as much as the Hensh does
12and no I don't
12It's gallery software, not mine
03oh
03lame
03and jeez, wtf did you do
12What now? LOL
03I can't hack it and get the picture without the watermark
/me runs
12:3
03Not that I actually want the picture
03I'm just messing around
03I like how you went with my watermark choice :PO
03-O
12Yeh it's awesome
I've only watched 50 minutes of it
03except sometimes it covers up important parts of the image LOL
and that fight scene between Neo and Morpheus is hilarious
or however you spell his name
<a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('displayimage.php?pid=971&amp;fullsize=1','148355644bfc4b427911b','scrollbars=yes,toolbar=no,status=no,resizable=yes,width=878,height=708')"><img src="wm.php?pid=971&amp;mode=normal" class="image" border="0" alt="Click to view full size image"><br></a>

Tell me about the BZP incident.
Neopets taught me the error of being a n00b
getting mad because nobody replied when I posted pictures of my custom Toa

olo
had to go sceptile to fix it
/me rages
it's not that
And then my first post in RDX's forum was bragging about being the 100th member
my internet is lagging like <censored>
lol, I am good
I corrected all of the mods, just because I hated them so much.
XD
and it's killing CGI:IRC

Ah
ugh
Tufi Puyumi or whatever was the most obnoxious forum mod I've ever seen.
I think I remember that person
03LOL, a tank called Deathstalker
you playing l4d?
She was just this really prim, proper, and somewhat vengeful mod who closed every topic possible in the MOC board.
She was also a vehement feminist, and would delete topics with toa who had feminine attributes, despite that there are female toa. xD
03no

woww

I think I'm def the most fun mod I've seen :P no arrogance intended
I would depose you if I had the chance.
/me shrugs.

Seriously, though.
hahhahahah remember nikki's topic trying to make me a mod??
Yep.xD

Theowlette sent me a PM in like September saying that if she couldn't handle the forum on her own she'd make me a mod.
cool
Yeah. It'd be so weird, though.
I'm sure that the place will def be up in population when the movie come sout
All three of the other mods abandoned the forum. xD

That'd be the day

I hope I'm there to see it
Twilight is long gone.
yup
She was such a twitard, too.
tbh, I'm suprised deane still came as often as he did around the trailer release
He's on, like, everyday apparently.
He only post rarely, though.
*He'll
mhmm but when the forum was active I don't remember him being on much... remember when theowlette said she wished he had his number or whatever when twilight's friend got on and deleted stuff?
Ah, yeah.
That was a bad time. xD
I love how we thought it was rl and cheez
(like they'd have the brains to hack the forum :'D)
gosh e-life was so much simpler then XD
I don't remember thinking that. Hm?

how do I rename a file
03LOL
03dunn
03o
hello
lololololcan'trenamefiles
03I think the proper procedure involves taking a hammer, destroying the computer, then switching to a PC?
there's not right-click rename opyion
"But you wanted to call it this!"
option
and clicking the name doesn't help either
Hey.
who dis
drf
I'm RDX
click it lots and lots and lots
03what
I'll do that AFTER I turn my exam in
or hold-click
I want my grade
who dat
03XD
...
sometimes helps on windoze
cute
I thought sbcglobal looked familliar.
I know, right?
http://ocaoimh.ie/how-to-rename-a-file-in-mac-os-x/ the very first sentence made me laugh
03XD
03I like how it's .ie
lmao
that explanation does NOTHING to help me
but the first comment on the bottom did it
that's just hold-click
which works in windows
although, windows lets you click on any part considered to be the file
doesn't have to be icon->name
03hold-click doesn't do anything o.o
does for me o.O
or did.
well, still does on folder
s
03heh
wonder why I can't make it work on files any more
they just want to open instead
there we go!
/me chews Espeon
now to figure out what I actually did
ah
double click, but hold for about a second each time
I love how macs have like a thousand programs for searching for a single file ---
-_-
you mean they set lots of programs running to do it or have a ridiculous number of ways to search?
murr
What on earth...
This is so .. weird.

What's the firewall doing?
I just thought it was a typo
XD
/me doesn't bother with firewalls, or AV.
blocking some sites
That was a looooong time ago
Something in it is broken so therefore sometimes random instructions execute incorrectly, or hang the computer.
Ah
I just scan every so often, and clean out the crap.
How long inf
Freaking viruses that caused my dad to put up the freaking firewall
Heheh.
I've never enountered a Freaking Virus.
Are they dangerous?

/me runs
:P
:P
:P
:P
They're very dangerous
So specific...
They're over 9000 times worse that normal viruses
(It's an ancient boxen so, that's why it's annoying. Because most everything is discrete, however... I'm /not/ going to test each individual component, so I'm trying to see what "part" is broken.

Why you gotta give meh nightmyurz?
You asked
:P
Within 1 minutes of running a scan, I have...116 infected registry keys. XD
0.o
wtf?
Ooh, 141.
last night I had a dream there was a ghost in my house and then at the end we had to buy the mexican family across the street dog food
hmm
it was really weird
Probably all that illegal Pokemanz stuff you do
:P
Registry keys don't show up in task manager. :P
Some do.
dari
If they're infected, they become a process.
he makes illegal pokemanz
03http://superclassicvideogames.com/Nec_TurboExpress_machine.jpg oh woah
:P
50 minutes
ahhaahahahahah it's no fun being an illegal alien
I don't have 148 processes running, so clearly that's not always the case. :P
How lomg your gonna be on i mean
Long are we*
lol
Lol sure
Dari: Like I said, some not all. It depends on the virus, if there even is one.
If the wifi will work this time
>_>
oh hell i dont know
maybe an hour or two
Which reminds me, since I can't get on SF, someone else needs to take over the pokemon tournament
the other night I had a dream where there were kittens the size of hamsters and there were hamsters too and then the cats started morphing into more hamsters and it was all very confusing and creepy
I will
:D
huh?
OK, you're in charge now
BRAWL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111111111
You don't remember
?
K

thats why i cant remember
Nah, nah, you got it all wrong.

You're not a mod
[censored]'s bar, 1974, with Greasy's guys.
Unless you want to log into my account
No I mean in the thread
But I don't think SR would be happy with that
Oh
The infected registry keys are probably just left over crap from viruses I've killed earlier, I'd bet that most by themselves are harmless.
not in the announcement section
just a mock announcement
Yeah, and like I said, I was simply wondering if they'd show up as a process. :P
man.. if i could of just got that hammer... i would have cleaned that place up
Bwhahahaha
and then i'll back you up and look like the hero
I need to go back there

03I mean
03when it's on YOUR site
03:P
03*side
03what I want to do
He thought it was illegal
03is get a Smeargle
uber I mean]
being legendary and all sorts a badass
03sketch it to learn Spore, False Swipe, Mean Look, and some other move
Like #3?
03it would be a POkémon catching machine:D
I should just make an invincible pokemon and trash you all. ;)
and a pokemon fainting machine o.o
Radical bro
prince dari makes a spritomb with wonder guard on it
Yep.
03hm?
03nol
03*no
now I'm bored
Why noyt just use Wonder Bread?
*not
03Mean Look to prevent them from escaping, Spore to put them to sleep, False Swipe to get them to 1HP
No, use Wonder Boner.
ahh
12baton pass
wonder bread is as awesome as toast
12XD
xD
03no Pokémon other than Smeargle can legit-ly learn all 3
i didn't think of that XD
ew wonder bread
Lol
03yeah Baton Pass but why?
03oh
03you mean for the 4th move?
12yes
03ah
Wunder*
03yeah
12baton pass to a pokemon that won't die s easily
03because only Smeargle can do that XD
Sliced bread: The best thing since... some other significant achievement.
at least someone knows how to pronounce my username at least :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ79pCJBcJ8

03random Wi-FI battle?
naw, we're buds on YT
"Who wants to clean and debone 'em?"
03oh
AHHHHHH YES I LOVE SHUFFLE TODAY
12the bad thing about smeargle drf is that its so darn slow
03hm
03can you EV train it to get its speed up?
12yes
03:P
LOL at dari's commercial
03I need to GET a Smeargle first
03but yeah
12it only have 75 base speed though drf XD
03hm
You got censored.
03well I could get one of the stats that boosts Speed and lowers like, Special Attack
03since I'd only be using it to catch
The topic of the video.
knife as a [censored].
Fine then
:P
03er nature
03not stats
Only without the wonder.
Be that way
12i got it
12drf teach it agility instead
03um
03no
03because Mean Look has to be used on the first turn
Ohh, boner.
03for the ones that run
12yes mean look
Censored. :P
12spore then setup agility XD
I think it would be benefitial though
12i dunno
12i guess a level 100 smeargle
12should be able to have enough speed
playback delete and rewind
03yeah
03I mean, I'd really just need it as a catching machine XD
yeah, one second
I have to finish talking to some people
k
12my only concern is that it has low seed XD
12*speed
/me has 20 million conversation windows open at once
03yeah well
03I'll see
03It was just an idea :P
YouTube comments are so amusing.
XD
ha
12drf
12maybe heal block
03hm
12For 5 turns, the target cannot select or execute any of the following moves: Heal Order, Milk Drink, Moonlight, Morning Sun, Recover, Rest, Roost, Slack Off, Softboiled, Swallow, Synthesis, and Wish. The effect ends when the target leaves the field. Heal Block does not prevent recovery from Black Sludge, Leftovers, and Shell Bell.
yes?
I just got Rick Rolled from a page you liked on facebook
ha
You mean tits?
ha
...I don't remember any rick roll pages o_O usually I just like stuff I see when other people have it on the main page without visiting the page..
mr rick tits
boobs
I clicked the "you"
and it was a rickroll
03hm
ah see I don't click the links lol I just click "like" on the bottom of ones I see other people like lol
03actually nah
haha
03none of the roaming legendaries have moves like that
A guy in the comments goes "So what's next, master baiter?"
12well i thought you wanted a catching machine
12not a roaming legendary catch machine
03I do
Yeah, I thought so too.
03but Mean Look is only needed for roaming oines
03*ones
12mean look for roaming
12spore to add your chances of catching
Tits?
ugh more people are going idle :(
12false swipe so you don't kill the blasted pokemon and heal block incase you want to catch a pokemon who has rest or something
/me is no longer idle
Yummy
...XD
The top questions are:
1. How is babby formed?
2. How does the dust collect on the cleavage
3. Whodunit?
lol
lolz
babby is formed when the whhore's cleavage is clean
Nah, you must do way instain mother.
whodunit? me.
I MAGICALLY IMPREGNATED HER
12got to make sure your smeargle has technician as well drf
12the ability
Dude, you were climacticly conceived. xD
Lol
lol
anyway
07BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!
:o
huza wha
I IS AWAKE
Show me your moves!
oh god that reminds me of raininglight
5dam im up "mom"
so fuccking obsessed with falcon punch
Come on!
yeah!
Awsome
03um
03Technician?
03what's that do
Just awsome
12if an attack has 60 or less base power
Harsh
12technician makes that attack do 50% more damage
O.o
blargh
03hm
You are his mother?
You gave him a name [censored]ser though
I'mma surrender now.
:D
12it'll make things a little faster
12since false swipe is only 40 base power
yes his name is dicckser
03ah
minus 1 c
:D
03well assuming it's not roaming
How lovely
but he prefers to shorten it to dxr
03I can just weaken it, then switch in Smeargle
ha
it's only slightly less obvious though
12but what if it is roaming
12think ahead
03then I'd just use False Swipe over and over and over XD
12not mention
12*not to mention
12you don't want to fall victim to pressure
"It's so hot in my neighborhood that grown men will walk up and down the street in boxers. Oh, the horrors!"
12you want to max your damage
eww
I know. Preicsely why I had to share it with you all.
xD When?
couple hours ago
just a sec
03hm
03so let's see
03I want its ability to be Technician, what nature?
03boost speed, lower special attack
Bwha
03that seems to be the best choice, right?
12you have 2 choices
^this
12that or boost attack lower special attack
ugh bored
12i think you have the right idea
12you want to max your damage
Did you talk to her today?
yeah
12but speed is bigger priority
03right
03and I don't want to lower defense
03so I'm thinking lower special attack
03since False Swipe is physical, right?
briefly then her sister and her started fighting over the keyboard like they always do then they logged off lol
12i'd say 252 Attack / 252 speed / 6 HP
03erm
03what?
12EVs XD
lol infa z
Lol good luck
:P
Lol, without warning and all?
/me furtively distributes anti-falcon gear.
lol
Its gonna be a blood bath
We're going to wash blood?
03oh
03well I don't do EV training
Wash in it
03really, it's just like
That's a little counterproductive.
03I need to know what to catch
Perhaps
12want to know the easiest way to sketch?
03what
03double battles?
12well that
FLYING CATS
Aicy
12but south of that flower town in diamond/pearl/platinum
XD
12is a double battle you can do over and over again
03hm
03OK
03well
03I need to catch a Smeargle first
12and they have like level 10 pachies
03what I was thinking is like
03at its first Sketch
03teach it a move that can KO the enemy
Eh do the same for me
03so I can level it up
03then teach it the 3 moves
03then finally get rid of that one
12ok
Dirty liar
12you are going to have fun training smeargle
EXCITING [censored] IS GOING DOWN!
12its stats are so horrible XD
:O
Did it censor?
:P
Is it in your mind
yeah
no...
it';s in YOUR mind
apparently exciting censored is going down
lol
exciting censorship?
[censored] yeah
Yes
03yeah -_-
That's what I meant to say
:P
03I wish someone could just like
03trade me a level 100 Smeargle with 4x Sketch
EXCITING CENSORSHIP
03that would be extremely useful XD
03but it's probably impossible to get that without it being hacked
JewishDino?
12i can pokesav one XD
XD
03yeah, I want legit
03not hacked

1st is my guess
/me grabs one of Icy's tails and drags her into dark world with him
Why are unncessary censorships so funny?

2Uh, I really think that the t-rexes in DBZ don't look so intimidating. >.>
*unnecessary
That's one of those things there is no reason but itself
the ones with the spikes on their head and made them look all weird?
they just are
2Yeah. =_=
Why is anything funny really?
*where there is
Well, literally or in theory?
in theory
A certain form of humor that corressponds with the individual's "sense" of humor.
:P
lol
I cannot beleive I'm doing this...
:P
But then again, that excludes polite laughter as lying, really.
haahaha......

everyone else who's doing this doesn't have a color
cause dari is green
I dunno
I'm lost
I'm not green. :P
i'm blue
yeah those two are opposites
Why are you green?

Will she be back?
huh?
You tell me, great, and almighty Dari.
This kid has no strategy^
I made your name be dark green
why are RDX and I the same color?
you can set specific people to be certain colors with IceChat
He's two higher than me
You can with mIRC too.

Then on the third day, Satan said: "Let there be cool air in the depths! And he saw that it was bad."
"And God said...Let there be levees"

/me is procrastinating.
You would when you were pulverised on impact.
What impact, they're stationary.
Did you see that! I spelled it the English way.
*?
Spelled what the English way?
7L4yM3N
Pulverized as pulverised.
oh
How is it pressed if both are stationary, and it is already between them?
That's why it's in quotes. They're /not/ both stationary.
But I said I wouldn't mind if they were.
Then that's completely irrelevant. xD
Because they aren't, lol.
The "hard place" is stationary, the rock is experiencing motion.
Somehow I doubt a rock could "pulverize" me, maybe a boulder.
Go back to the grape analogy. It wouldn't really, unless it was a boulder, for example.
There you go.
/me doesn't want to be purple
Your spyro!
Well what do you want to be?
</late>
None of them. I'm an observer. :P
I wanna blend in with the scenery ^^
Oh, Ariste, never mind.
Ok, I'll make you white...Then I won't actually be able to see you at all, interesting.
That's racist. xD

/me preforms a tri-dot wave
Because I know him.
...
I see.
03XD
Yep
I was just gonna say that
The density of rocks near the surface of the Earth is only about 3 times that of water, so the interior must be made of much heavier materials such as iron and nickel. The Earth's magnetic field shows that the core can hold or cause a strong magnetic field. Iron is the logical material, because of its high density and its magnetic properties.
Drf
Bleh.

I'm finishing freshman year in high school so I'm tight for time.

Yay :)
03like the few times I do use the touchscreen keyboard on my Droid
03I just don't use it
03I turned it off XD
(you can force autocorrect to swearwords by adding them as people to your contacts list)
Turned it off
its a workaround.
03LOL
03well
03not swear words per se
03words like wh0re, etc

Wb feather
from before I signed in as you
Said it was dumping physical memory
O.o
then it wouldn't boot
So I turned it off and turned it back on
And now it works
but wtf?
D:
Oh
well icechat is being dumb then
because it doesn't say you have voice
D:
Hm
it does on my view
which channel?
I ran every single one of my antivirus tools last night and none of them returned anything serious
draconicwolves
yeah it says I do on mine
oh well
then boom, blue screen of death
Icechat's being dumb
Dari did it. :P
.....
>.>
/me whistles innocently.
Your netbook doesn't seem to have been made very well or something
/me whistles guiltily.
I don't think that's it
I probably got hacked or something
Nah.
BSODs happen all the time for no apparent reason.
...
No reason?
Yeah, I've heard of a lot of people getting it for no reason
Just kidding.
So I might /not/ have a virus?
I used to get them randomly immediately after pressing 3 random keys at the same time by accident.
It wasn't that. :P
But that doesn't make any sense at all
10Thanks
It wouldn't have any connection to IRC.
xD
I know
I'm not saying it did
BSoDs don't make sense, either.
I'm just saying it's a weird coincidence
Yeah you stopped talking the second I identified
that was weird
it seemed like it confused my computer or something
which again, I know makes no sense
Arg
300k stuffz scanned 169 infections.
wE'VE RESORTED TO PIRATESPEAK, NOW?
:P
...
Did it happen to scan for a Staph infection?
/me uses tri-dot slumber.
Or perhaps a Flood infection.
/me fail
>_<
I'm using MBAM, doesn't tell you what it is scanning for specifically, just where generally.
I have that, but it never finds anything
Even when I knew I had an actual virus
Mine always does.
You should take meds for that.
It's considered one of the best scanners out there.
Was that the one you got after the Help Desk incident?
Yeah
haha
the search redirecting one
yeah
And the one that always crashed Chrome
If you go on any computer help forum they always tell you to use Hijackthis, ComboFix, or MBAM.
Usually they tell you to scan with MBAM first.
And you had MBAM before that?
I've used both combofix and MBAM
Combofix seemed to have worked
Then if problems persist upload a Hijackthis log.
But either iI got another virus or the one from before never went away
The most annoying I had was one transmitted through the router.
Redirected all internet connections through proxy.
/me wishes she had computer expert friends
And all adverts on the internet were for porn, viagra, or penis enlargement pills from then on.
I killed it though. :)
xD
half that was censored
Disconnect router, reset, scan for virus with MBAM on all 3 computers.
You could have simply gone into safe mode, but alright.
What do you do about making sure they're gone?
Nope.
So I should get hijackthis?
Hijackthis is only good if you really know what you are doing, or have someone who does to help you.
Because it doesn't discriminate between good and bad, you decide what goes.
yeah, not me then
<.<
I find it useful for things I know I want gone.
If I knew what was causing it it would be gone now
You also need to be careful since Hijackthis has a very limitied whitelist.
How do you go about making sure viruses are gone for good, even if you don't know exactly where or what they are?
/me plays a tune on his ocarina
Oh, okay. My mistake.
Yknow
*limited
Depends on the virus really.
I've done job applications and bought things on this computer
I think I'll get rid of this ol prop and get a real ocarina
Br
Brb
People could be getting my SSN and bank account numbers and stuff
>.>
Oh, they already have them.
Yeah, that's why people often keep a computer they don't download stuff onto.
They were up on a site.
Didn't I tell you?
....
:P
Sorry. :P
or at least jokes of that nature
/me meausres the Line, then steps back.
*measures
Haha
yeah, sould probably go and try scanning for viruses again
<.<
It may have been nothing
I highly doubt a BSOD is nothing
need to start up my DS
<.<
Woah, apparently my state hit a new record for temperature this time of year. I knew it was hotter than usual.
it is a lot of the time

Then I dropped my DS (out of shock, clearly), and the screen froze.

Yep. XD

Looks like I got myself some spyware.
5D:
/me pulls out SAS to zap the thing
that sucks
Actually, I study these things
I'd like to know how they work
study invasions of spyware?
No, the code they are based on
ah
so I can track them and find their intent
To the linux mint sandbox!
5Sorry if I post slow here, guys. xD; I'm (big surprise) roleplaying.
he kills me and i pop around the corner like the boogie man and stab him
5So how is everyone this morning/afternoon/evening? (: What's up?

03I have it set to record
03LOL
7*dork*
5Ew, Transformers.
XD, thought you did
5./shot'd
Lulz.
5xD
ew transformer 2 is more preferable
hi RP
5What!?
/me is super uber late
it was
it's like...the animation series of transformer
it kills fans
like the phantom menace of transformers :p
brb
5And her makeup and hair remained prim and proper. No. No. NO.
03well
03you, like my friend
because the 2nd movie likes racism? XD
03might be glad then
03because
03MEgan Fox was apparently fired
03from TF3
really, they had 2 robots
5I heard!
5I celebrated!
03XD
that were black sterotypes
5I can't stand that woman!
5Yeah, I know Brother.
drf: all the boys here are crying over that :p
5But keep in mind they said the same thing about Jynx.
5"They" referring to critics, of course.
Jynx...Jnyx...
totally dont know who Jynx is
5From PokÃ©mon?
5LOL.
5First generation, dude!
oh XD
my memory is bad, super bad
Dude, if you don't know pokemon why are you here? :P
if it wasnt the one I loved, I dont remember it
5Either that or you didn't play R/B/Y enough.
jk
5;3
because I'm looking or the hoy grail! :p
*for
You seek the holy grail?
RP4L: neverplayed them
aye
5WHAT IS YOUR NAME.
5WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR.
wha is your quest
5Best movie ever.
Okay.
what is the speed of a unalient swallow o3o
5Next to... like... Spaceballs. And The Blind Side.
Spaceballs FTWF
FTF-inW
For the win forever
:p
the movie was great
For the effin win :P
the anime series
was not
5What?
5What anime series?!
5O-o
oh, you didnt hear did you?
5That's as weird as when they tried to make Star Trek into a manga. xD;
G4 made a anime series
5That's ridiculous.
you can find it on youtube
well its G4
RP4L: well they did alot of that
It was a victim of the 80's cartonification process that got literally everything.
I hate X-men + Star Trek comics
except earlier
it got Star Wars
Star Trek
5I love Star Trek comics. But not when they tried to manga-fy it.
5IDW = For the win.
5And Malibu! Can't forget Malibu Comics!
but now they really kill series
freddy is probablly dead since the remake of nightmare on elms-street
5LOL yeah.
they make the blonde chick who dies
the main charater fr 1/2 of the movie
:|
how can you make a pointless charater a main one?
back
5I hate that. The blonde/pretty girl always is wearing heels, always runs down a hall, always trips, and always gets torn apart first in horror movies.
lively place
:P
5I happen to be blonde. >__>
So in a horror movie
say...Aliens
yeah
we'd be sure to send you in the dark room :D
It's because she's blond, isn't it?
/me dies
5xP
03btw RP4L
5NO.
03did you see that one episode of MythBusters
03where they busted Spock's um
03er
5I'd save everyone.
03Kirk
03the um
03cannon made out of bamboo
03they proved youc an't actually do that
5Awhat? xD
5Oh that!
RP4L: but you're not ripely? D:
5Yeah.
5Well.
or are you?
are you two doing one on one?
5That was pretty predictable. They're not TEH CAPTAIN KIRK.
03XD
5I'd save everyone because I am not the stereotype. :D
xD
5Kirk is like Chuck Norris.
what about agaisnt a predator?
not like that
XD
I know. :P
5But everyone knows that Jack Bauer pwns 'em both.
Kirk: the chuck Noris of the future
:P
5I LOVE YOU JACK I'M SAD YOUR SERIES ENDED. ;___________;
/me 5falls on the ground sobbing.
Spok: ..the bill nye of the future?
I will now
Kirk in the 60's = chuck norris of his age. Shatner nowadays = average guy looking for a buck.
5SHATNER OWNS.
5Still.
I wish I had the book on it, but I'll have to settle for a reliable wiki article.
5Even though he's 79.
5He turned that old on March 22.
5Did you know that?
5I doubt it. 83
that's where I'm reading it too
lol
Go down to the planet now
>:(
5NO.
5I'm engineering.
5Haaaaaaaa.
It matches up with his stance on other sites, so it hasn't be tampered with.
and put on that shirt
/me beams RP4L down
5NO. D:
YES
5I'M ENGINEERING NOT SECURITY DAGNABBIT.
5ENGINEERING WEARS RED TOO.
well we're short a few
5SCOTTY BEAM ME THE HECK BACK. DD:
Scotty is dead
I did not kill him o3o
just like you >:)
5D:
5DDDD8
Jaws did
in JAWS 3-D, the most horrible of the JAWS series
where 80s 3-D punched us in the face
5Ha.
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/22479-jaws-3d
yes
saw that
That's all I have to say about jaws 3-d
though I hate the Nostaliga chick
I love his opinion on positive neurosis, too.
but Garbage Pail kids is worse
She made the perfect sarah palin in kickassia, though
XP
5Who is "the nostalgia chick"?
5Who's the actress?
the female version of the NC
Team TGWTG
5What is her /name/?
basically review the 'girl' nostalgias
Yeah, I like that
google it :P
you ask someone who doesnt care ;P
5>>
or its on her wikipedia
She should have reviewed the care bear movie IMHO
meh
the Care Bears wasnt strictly limited to girls
just kids who wanted innocence in the world
several years later disney took that job :p
I think I'm slightly neurotic
to be honest
In exchange for your money
I'm trying to think of people who were/are living proof of positive neurosis.
Oh, I think almost everyone is.
yeah
to an extent
Yeah, of course.
Although its very introverted, so for some you'd never know.
that's what causes stress I assume
yeah, true
Mhm. No outlet to vent in, or you stop yourself from using one.
5I'm watching her review on Dragonheart.
but the nostalgia chick annoys me mainly due to her adding this new star to her show and doing semi-crappy reviews
That's the part that reminds me of myself
that, sparked all that openings for memes
when I get angry
I really have no outlet
she started a meme war i tell you XD
but I kinda liked the movie
so it causes an imbalance in the way I think
though I didnt know the dragon was james bond
I think that's where self-harm comes in, unfortunately.
because I try to remain calm
Yeah I know
that's why I worry about myself XD
Have you seen or read Fight Club?
Don't remain calm unless you're harming something around you. If you have the opportunity, vent the anger, in my opinion.
Yeah.
yeah, like into a pillow
or anything like that
uhhh.....
For me, when I get angry, I go from one distraction to the next and before long I forget about it.
How'd it go?
Ditto
hey
I just deleted a [censored]load of programs I don't use
The only power emotion possesses is what you provide for it.
That's probably a good idea
=/
I hope that wasn't meant to be sarcasm
Not at all
I'm not really in the mood for sarcasm right now
it seems like it would be
Yeah, I was legit.
k
...
What were some of the programs?
phonegap, google toolbar, google desktop...
um...
some windows live crap I never used
notepad++ seems to have disappeared though
Hmm
I wanted to keep that
Yeah, I bet it helped with web design
Oh, one more thing before I stop annoying you all.
Hm?
I'm doing yet another virus scan
Yeah I saw that
Lol
I laughed, but it's accurate.
But what do I know?
More than me
Haha
Not even.
About this stuff
I'm in high school.
Oh... maybe.
other things... I probably have an upper hand
yeah
lol
Like Mass Effect?
xD
XD
Yeah, probably
XD
I don't know how something could have gotten on it in the time between the last scan and now
Where did he get it? :P
I've barely been on the internet
adds?
There are viruses that wait until after a scan to emerge, but they're sort of rare.
that's why I'm wondering if it's one of those random blue screens Dari was talking about
I've gotten a blue screen with this laptop
they're not just random things that mean nothing
and I've had no problem since
night all
/something/ had to have happened to cause it
I have to use McAfee
Ew.
I know
I'm sorry for your loss.
*lots
I can't get on the internet at school without it
Yeah, our school requires it
it really sucks
Why, do they think you'll let the network get infected?
we had to customize the settings to get on IRC?
lol @ braveheart reference
Yeah, something like that
*>
*.
yeah, for some reason it automatically blocked IRC communication
I can't think of any reason why
I mean, you'd think people who used an IRC connection would realize it and not want it blocked
Well wtf
the only hardware I have plugged into this thing is a mouse and an SD card
It might be something about the netbook itself that got messed up
Nah, you can get BSoD regardless of hardware.
What usually causes it?
Anything, really. It sense a problem in rhetoric and shuts down to avoid it.
hello lev
Computers are fickle like that.
*It'll
back
I wonder why it says it dumps the physical memory when it does that
My computer has had a similar problem plaguing it for a couple of years.
I always get my stuff back
it says why here
\http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death
No matter what my dad and I do to replace hardware, fic the power supply, defrag, nothing will find the source of the problem.
I shouldn't have eaten those shrimps x__x
it dumps it to a file
then recovers as much as it can
after restarting
It'll reboot at any time inter intermittiently, and no log is made in both of my antivirus programs. :P
Yeah, and if you use a PC it'll ask if you want to resume normally or retreat into SM, lol.
This place got quiet fast
ugh, I should have taken note of the file that it said caused the error
/me shuts up.
Just wait until it happens again, and you'll be prepared. :)
Yeah, I'd rather it just not happen again
It got the blue screen, but it's working now
it's not dead, but I think it's close
<.<
Have you tried shock paddles?
try a system restore
the paddles!
If it does go, though, make sure you stock up on Max Revives.
I don't know when I'd restore to though
save everything important on another disk and restore it as early as possible
Most computers come with recover disks nowadays
you can whipe everything
Yeah, good point.
and set it up from scratch with that
If it happens one more time, and you don't find the log, wipe it.
*recovery
I've already wiped this computer twice
It doesn't know that. Sh...
Why yes
Yes it did
"A BSOD will strike every Windows PC at least once."
http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=1647
Does that mean one with Windows hardware? Because mine is custom but hasn't gotten BSoD.
probably just means a computer running a Windows OS
I think so
Good to know.
indeed
"This frequent, although less so in newer operating systems, error occurs whenever Windows senses a software, hardware or driver error which will not allow it to continue operating properly. In other words, it happens all the time, for all sorts of reasons."
...Awesome
enjoy your sacred ... power
"Let's take a moment to look at a BSOD in its natural environment, careful now, we don't want to startle it... Note the eye catching shade of blue intended to warn us of trouble, the detailed list of hexadecimal numbers, and relatively unhelpful 'tip.' This is the BSOD in all its glory, so be very afraid if you ever come face to face with this hideous creature! " Hah
Lol
if you can go to programs and accessories then system tools there should be a system restore thing
xD
Yeah, I know how to do a system restore
hm?
What will you do with it?
ok
I just don't know when I'd restore to is all
does it have bench marks?
you could restore it to last month
I like how appropriate the color blue is in a BSoD.
It's the equivalent of the sky falling for your comp.
Well if it's that same virus I had before, last month wouldn't be of much help
The problem is I have no idea what the cause is
So there's no point I could think of that would make sense to restore to
Did your computer come with a recovery disk?
No bootable disk drive, remember?
oh yeah
Hmm
Well, I think we have an XP recovery disk
I could mail it to you
because you have the external disk drive now
"Firefox has determined that the following add-ons are known to cause stability or security problems"
Hmm
I get that a lot actually
Java deployment kit
part of why I stopped using Firefox
I barely ever use firefox though
So that can't be it
I will
I have no idea |3
I don't think I could use the XP recovery disk either
the power of an almighty dot
in your possesion
It just reinstalls XP on your PC, right?
yeah
Yeah
wouldn't work
and deletes everything before it
why not?
Because the external CD drive doesn't work like that
Oh, it isn't for downloading
/me dual dot charges the 3rd tri-dot
just running?
Downloading?
why would there ever be downloading?
Installing I mean
I get the two mixed up
So the disk drive can't be used for installing then?
ah im back
Installing is fine with normal applications
I've installed games through it before
operating systems are a different story though
Do they install differently?
Yeah
oh I suppose
they couldn't really install the same way
what are you trying to reboot it all together?
That's why my computer came with the Acer recovery thing
.. Where is LL anyway?
hmm
Would that work?
that's what I did the other two times
Would that work?oh
oopps
*oh
Apparently it didn't
Or it did and I ran into another problem
who knows
03no idea :/

wow
then he should stop being a [censored] and tell me
I wish I were that good.

i hate computers
Me too
Itouches ftw
ummm no
Computers smd
wb brother
Not really
there are some chat areas where you can go and talk to a techie that might help
And a lot of tech forums too
my brother had something wrong with his laptop a while ago and he went on one of those
chats'll give you more of a rapid responce
true
is there anything currently wrong with it right now
chesticles.
uh...
you need to go to a doctor for that
Not that I can tell
hmm
infa z boobs are the woman balls
it could just be a hardware thing or your computer tripin over its feet or something
uh?
anyway I'll let you guys get back to whatever it is your talking about
:D
ty
D;
Yeah, I mean you never know for sure, but it could just be something with the hardware
I think so
acer isnt very high on the brands
I hope not
but I think so
I pretty much bought it because it was cheap and it was recommended to me
i see it on amazon and there are quite a few people saying they dont like acer
by someone who I thought new what he was talking about
*knew
acer is good and cheap but cheap is the main word there
asus tends to be one of the better name brands
How dumb
however laptop brands all have there lemons and thats what i ran into when i got my toshiba
Her computer might be f'ed up
i got the toshiba because it was a above average brand that had a few things i wanted but it was slow and did not do all i wanted
you gona back it up and restore it?
Probably not
maybe if it happens again
I realize that
That's what I'd say to do is wait for it to happen again
Just wanted to give a proper farewell.
that way if it's something small you aren't wasting time
Buh-bye...
hm?
ok... bye
Was I too rude to him earlier?
<.<
No
I don't think you were being rude at all
lol no
no
uh oh
I AM THOUGH >D
oh crap

I'll leave there
before SR kills me

it's fixed

its all been a rouze to get to spyro chat
but if he doesn't care why would he care about that?
uggggh
He's not exactly what you could call rational
Heh
he needs to make up his mind I think
if he cares or not
I've known him a reallllly long time and I still don't understand how his mind works
probably never will
canadians...
:P
LL!
:O
I don't understand how anybody's mind works, I confuse myself a lot even, but he's way out there
12ohai Guesst~
I'm not even close to understanding him
about the only time i ever see him come on is when we are talking about computers of software
not even
He is going to murder me
only when HE wants to
<_<
no he isn't
you never gave me op
Yeah, but again
try telling him that

hmm
can a virus go through the network onto other compters connected to that network?
that's what I thought had happened
I think so
12back
depends on the router I think
and yeah, I think they can
i dont see how but i need to have a talk with my brother then...
Routers naturally block out depending on the router
my dad was freaking out
but a virus can easily be transfered over emails and all that crap, FTP whatever
He thought it would spread to his computer
It could
i can see it on emails but for a network... hmmm
i thought that you couldnt share files unless you allowed permission for that sort of thing
And then my laptop BSoD'd a couple hours ago
If I lose this thing I will have no computer access
Kidding me?
I'm forbidden to use the family computer now because of those trojans that were on it
It'll be alright

Hey, are you alright though?
12-a
Yeah
2fssssh
it'll work out
2I really need to work on that bookmark D:
I got a headache, but maybe it's just from worrying too much
arg
probably
2except that I don't feel like it right now
dont worry too much
that causes a lot of headaches
2except that's what I said yesterday so I'm behind schedule
My dad really took it seriously
2except I should go take my medicine right now
I don't know why he reacted that way
hmm
We could all get our identities stolen or something if trojans got in
except
it seems like he'd want to fix the problem, not want to punish for it
You have two days
and tonight
and morning.
it's not a punishment so much as a precaution
but that's it.
ive had my card stolen but its easy to recover from it as long as you get it quick
I guess
2D:
2DDDD:
but it sounds like he took it out on you
that's what I don't like
2except
2you have more break D:<
I'm having problems with my computer and now there are trojans on my account on the family one
I realize how bad it looked
and I realize his concern
2AND I STILL NEED A JACKET OAO
but I don't think he should directly take it out on you
Put two and two together, and the logical conclusion is that I'm going on places on the internet that I shouldn't be
talk to you about it yes
Oh, you're cosplaying? o3o
but flip out, no
2well
2I have pants
as who?
2old karate pants which I don't know if they fit me still 'cause they're size one
I know it looks that way, but you know it isn't, so it wouldn't hurt for you to have a chance, all I'm saying
2'cept I haven't grown too much since last year so I SHOULD be able to
My dad is about as easy to reason with as SR when it comes to me and the internet
I know
I just wish it didn't have to be that way
did your mom say anything about it?
She couldn't care less
07BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!
Has no idea what's going on
Oh
12karate o3o;
maybe she should, she might be more reasonable about it
She doesn't like to argue with my dad
I don't blame her
12my clothes don't fit right anymore ;3;
usually if he says something, she won't go against it
yeah, I know parents like that
I'm going to be a terrible parent if all parents are supposed to be like that
I don't think they are
I think we should vow to not be like that
I don't think that's right
That;s the way life works
kids learn from their parents' mistakes and improve on them
You'd think by now parents would all be perfect then
>.>
far from it...
See, you focus on one problem and you forget another though
2o3o
that's why
is because we're all human
we improve our parents mistakes and in turn make our own
we should just all turn into wolves

And there's only *one* type of personality disorder that she doesn't see and tries to refer to others when possible
But Minnesota is full of liberals so it's probably pretty high
And that's borderline personality disorder
it should be >400 a payperiod every two weeks
Over 400 every few weeks?
probably just tough to deal with

hmm
you can make friends with bpd
its just that they have unstable relationships
/me ish pinned again xx

You can make friends with a highly violatile explosive too
if your a casual friend and they know it then you may always be a casual friend however if you are more intimate they may be fairly frustrating to deal with

oh
It's really not worth the effort when you have several other billion people who don't pose as much of a danger to your wellbeing
I got the wrong thing out of it then
what is it?
/me noms ice cream after being healed o3o
wait
this ice cream...
borderline sortof is a personality disorder in which your sort of paranoid of your relationships with others
04?
2I think that's Sea Salt Ice Cream. oO
its not boot-to-the-head flavor is it?
04It be sea salt icecream
/me shot
ok
your depressed and you may accuse another person in who you care about for not likeing you
/me noms~
04:3
sort of that thing
/me huggles LL
ah
Axel likes Sea Salt~
Because, sooner or later, you'll do something that'll make them feel like you betrayed them
/me huggles back o3o
/me avoids ice cream and eats Oran Berries instead
lol
It could be failing to respond in time to a query on IRC or an e-mail
/me also noms some sea salt ice cream
/me feeds Latiaos Oran Berries still...
And hell hath no fury like a bpd who feels like he's been betrayed
/me snatches LL's Oran Berries and devours them
o.o;
i wouldnt say they are very dangerous...
they're hidden :P
2Yeah; now that I've eaten them.

even if you DID find them...
07which she did
07and then ate

2Not really. I just like eating Oran Berries.
well
i thinnk i may have met a bpd before (not sure if she was) but id just think that they would be frustrating to be around
the ones you wanted to steal...
were Latiaos's >:|
07a baby has a parent, I wouldn't steal FROM the baby, just from where the parent was hiding the food =D
07they can go find more X3

unless I'm taking things to literally of course

They are.
If you pull back the little metal bit, and see the actual disk bit.
It's some really flimsy, floppy blask thing. :P

06without a guest pass
-.- I walked half-way to school and realized I forgot a book, hopped back home, went back to school, and now I'm back.
06and since guest passes are for good reasons only, I basically sneak on campus whenever
13why is it illegal?
06techinally
03Aurora, I did th3at XD
06it's called intruder on campus

Guys, I've got it.
The newest advancement in slacker technology.
Yes? Do share
The rephraser. You find an article, copy and paste it into a text box, and the database inside of it uses a thesaurus to rephrase it. You then pick and choose what you want, and whatever kind of paper you need to write is done,virtually untraceable. :P
So it's a tool for plagiarism?
Yes. xD

03trying for the other one about playing as a jockey o.o
12which one?
12oh
03the one about riding a survivor
03my question
03there's one saying ride two survivors in one life
03how do you get OFF
12Qualified Ride or Back in the Saddle?
03once you get on?
03o.o
03first one
12and you don't
03so how does that work?
12until you down your ride
03erm
03oh
12or get bumped off
03so you have to actually kill them?
03wait
12no, just incapacitate
03hm
03that seems a lot harder to get then
12or someone else bumps you off
03and I probably can't do it on my own
12lolz
12just wait till they're lower on health
03I suppose I could always friendly-fire and murder two of my teammates
/me runs
12like: Yellow to Red
/me 7hears thunder.
12and :O
12thunder o3o
03because that way
03there's only one to save me
/me 7stuffs Larxene back into hammerspace >>
12that may come here later...
03I might try that o.o
12lolz
12btw drf
03apparently you have to kill a charger, while it's charging, with a MELEE weapon >_>
03I shot it and wa slike wtf, why didn't I get it?
12I have a theory about Survival and that Achievement
12and lolz
03and ?
03I tried it so many times earlier
03got to 4 minutes without going down
03but still nothing
03>:|
12the theory is that NO ONE can use anything but a Melee weapon v.v
03hm.
03well
03that means you need 4 people, right? o.o
12so we both need to use 2 controll-yah
03as the CPUs are gonna use guns
03or that
/me nods
03that sounds relaly hard with just two of us :|
/me nods o3o
03though, The Following or w/e it is, is the easiest place
03there's a giant tent you can ide in
12unless we hide the other two FAR away
03*hide
03hm
12The Passing? lol
03that
12lolz
03I might just do single-player campaign while I wait
12:o
03because, those achievements you can't get in co-op
/me nods
03since I actually finished one with you, remember?
03and still didn't get the achievement
03so eh
12yush

03yeah 18 same diff
12and you need to decapitate them o3o
burnt hair smells awfule
12did you open 5 Foot Lockers yet?

/me implodes
It's fun when you recognize characters from the previous game
13Roara?
6its Aurora and im not he/she/it anyways

Cry, then.
13idk
I need to not get so excited with these video games XD
i sort of have a short attention span and thats why i'm not into rpgs a whole lot
Cry, Puppet, cry!
Pokemon's an RPG
13brb
pokemon and the mario rpgs are the onlyones i've ever been into
Actually ME is much less of an RP than Pokemon
Especially the second one
/me goes shower now
Mass Effect 2 is more of a shooter
6puppet? i'm noone's puppet!
very little RPG elements
if i wasn't obsessed with pokemon when i was 8 then i would have never liked it today
The first one just had a lot of useless weapons and upgrades
hmm
and levelling up
but that was pretty basic
/me 6was gonna say something but it's so rude he might get kicked for it
You'd find so many things you'd have to keep switching equipment at least twice per level
pretty much
lol
is fallout more of an rpg then?
and you'd never even use half the stuff
Yeah it is
6*cries* noone knows who i am
6this prooves noone likes me :'(
Mass Effect is really just a story based shooter
with a large inventoryu
6*cries* boo-hoo!
ever play fear?
nope
lol i creeped my brother out with that one
what just happened?
:(
oh wait
unless it'll make her hug me :)
lol
gotta help clean the house XP
im still crying cause you people didn't knows who i was :'(
it intrigued me based on some of the creepyness
so i just basically watched it on youtube
and his head went through the urinal
all that time I was sitting in spyrochat o__o
Dusty cleavage
lol
it's dead there
I scared her...
:(
when I go to mibbit I automatically type "spyrochat" without even thinking about it
I gotta get used to going here instead...
dusty cleavage
juicy.
where does that come from anyway?
:(
I beleive
I made it up completely :P
no my band name is Dust in my Cleavage
but dusty cleavage works too i guess
...Does anybody know who that was?
o.o
:P
2Canada, apparently
07LOL
03yeah no idea o.o
2o3o
12i've been back from the dentist for some time now
Haha.
12i sort of passed out after i got back
Well that's fair, you're scary.
/part #SCARY!
Hahaha
very true, I must say
12with the tooth that was causing me trouble i had two options
12remove the tooth, or get a root canel which i can't afford
/part #spyrochat 4,1SCARY!
O_o
2O:
are uoi okay now?
...
*you
12i'm bleeding
12and the sight of blood makes me faint
12enough said?
No
and D:
woah, TS looks different now
http://www.twilightsucks.com/
Haha, when's the last time you've been there?
last week
Oh wow
it really does
it's not a hate group
we explain this to Twitards all the time
:P
Lol
It's just a place to criticize it without being insulted by twitards
12on the bright side unlike last time
:P
Do they get offended and strike back?
If they don't like it, they don't have to go there
Yeah, they do, haha
12i actually requested i take the tooth home with me
"The only possible way to not like twilight is to be in a hate group!"
12i didn't get a chance to mention that for my wisdom teeth
*"teh only psbl way 2 not liek twilite is 2 b in a h8 groop"
ha
http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=31
Those are quite funny to read
i dont even know wth twilight is besides abunch of vampires and werwolves duking it out
lol
and a stupid protagonist with no personality
yeah
outside of her sparkly boyfriend
XD I got an awesome banner
?
Haha, hatemail section
12oh well i was awake for part of the extraction from the feel of it i would of gotten the wisdom teeth in like a billion pieces lol
"If you think vampires sparkle and hang out at high school to pick up girls, don't clikc this banner"
Haha
O_o well, at least it's over now. or something.
o3o
2o-o
12at least i'm not a mouth
12if they lose their teeth they are doomed D:
As a girl, an experienced girl who knows what REAL love is (omg yer so hawt, omg you smell so good and I want to EAT YOU does NOT equate to chemistry, it's nothing but shallow infatuation) I know [censored] well that if a guy were to quote Twilight to me I'd kick him in the balls and tell HIM to grow a pair. I'd also feel horribly insulted that he's trying to make me swoon by spouting the words from a lonely housewi
ha
haha
I <3 Mars
"You need to go and read the whole series,OK? You can't just go make a site and be all 'I hate Twilight' and stuff. I think you probably just looked at the cover,read some random pages and decided that the books suck."
I did that
:D
the second sentence
Lol
I love how they always assume antis haven't read the books
But I heard about the rest of it from you
and saw both movies
Lol, yeah
"It's not possible to dislike it if you read the books!"
i hate books
it's all funny because the antis use proper grammer, spelling, and argument skills, and the 'tards rarely do
Yeah, exactly
XD
You can tell who knows about literature here
No I'm not
XD
D:
I can't see you as a teacher honestly
Me either
Not to be selfish, but do you think I'd make a good teacher?
:P
jk
i could become one but i have no real interest in it as id be the cool teacher that would just joke around the whole class
okay kids, I was too lazy last night to grade your tests
so whatever
yeah
just play or something
just like that
lol
not like the one who tells the class to read teh book and write notes while playing command and conquer on the computer
XD
yeah... had one of those
Or a Spanish teacher who has you watch movies... in English... all four years
lol
I had that one
wb Ecco
i liked my french teacher as she was a gossiper
tell her a false secret
and watch it spread
say something about anyone about someone in the school and forget about the rest of the class
jk that would be bad
as well we had french bingo in which you got candy if you won and sometimes had a few arts and crafts
"y do u hate twilight u prodly never read any of the books so how do u no and twilight rocks and edward is so hott so i dont know wat u are talking about cause twilight ROCKS and u probly have never seen the movie or read any of the books so u dont know any thing about it "
the entire argument
you know.. i dont know how people can expand an entire sentence worth of content into a paragraph
...Rocks much?
i had that problem in highschool
lol
?
the one where a twitard listed ways to make a hater mad
np
the one that got parodied
oh yeah
the "punch in the face" one
xD
Black Pawn Movement
that's the group's name
oh my god i'm laughing so hard apparently one of my friends ranted to another one of my friends about me for like an hour
hahaha
why?
Ah
apparently she bittches about everything too now hahahah nothing's good enough for her and if someone doesn't agree with her on everything she goes nuts
Just tell her you have the Couldn't-care-less disease. :P
Lol
Frequently mentioned nicks:
the wat.
she says that she's diagnosed with depression n shhit but she really doesn't have that bad of a life
even my life's worse than hers but I'm not sitting around moping about it lmao
OOH NO PEOPLE AT SCHOOL PICK ON ME, I'M SO SAD AND I KNOW SO MUCH PAIN!!!!!!11111

Those suck
12i was using a myth remody for stopping oral bleeding

12but now there is this really thin long string of gum where the tooth used to be
O.o
12i know its hard to explain
12but its gross
Hello.
Wait, he's mad at you for eating bacon?
O.o
Yep.
Why?
HE JUST LEFT IT THERE I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR ME I DIDN'T KNOW HE WANTED TO USE IT LATER ;__;
because my dad used to always leave bacon out for me...
12back~
Hopefully he's only a little annoyed
oh hell no he called my mom about it
=/
apparently they were yelling at eachother about it
Bacon is serious business
12hi it
Not that serious
:P
he's just looking for a reason to be mad at me because he's in denial with his own kids.
</sarchasm>

Lol

/me noms on his popcorn and watches the drama unfold

Okay, okay
Then the whole 19 club would be in agreement about popcorn
XD
That's better :)

;)
Club 19, the ABC premiere!
haha
03then we bought our dryer from Home Depot
03competitors FTW? XD
03(but that was because Lowe's was out of the dryer, and Home Depot had it in stock)
Hello
:D
/me pokes back
it could be some crap like all the teen dramas where the girl gets pregnant or something idk
Poke war!
Yeah, a club of all girls who get pregnant at 19
12XD
LOL
12nice
03they installed the dryer this morning o.o
12maybe it means they will reject each other :o
At least while I'm here :3
that's not as bad as that one lifetime movie though when they were all like what 10?
/me hides
03I did my laundry and my clothes are clean, so eh
03XD
03it's a matching set
Hahahaaha

Eww
03but get this
12lol
Using the scroll thing on that one apple mouse
03my dad was like "You should buy them from the same store to make sure they match"
XDDDD
10 year olds being pregnant?
>.<
03my mom and I were just like LOL WUT
12o.o

No
"HURR LETS ALL GET PREGNANT IT'LL BE FUN :D"
Sounds messed up
That's disgusting
it is messed up that's why I never watched it
/me doesn't think 10 year olds should be preggers
/me neither
/me agrees

Or 19 year old Stormies
Lol yeah
Again
I know someone at work who is 18, married, and has a baby
dayuuum
I know a few people like that
I know a lot of people like that over here
talk about throwing her life away
quite common in small town Wisconsin
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE DRINKING AND PARTYING WHEN SHE TURNS 21!?!?! D;
Like a third of my English class is a parent / married
Yeah, she said it was pretty common
or was*
I've never met anyone who's done that before
that I know of anyway
lol
They're just all so embarassed of their husbands they never told you
Heh
Haha
She won't don't worry
:P
eye contact
XD
Yes, eye contact is within the circle
As well as writing fan fiction about each other
Hehe
lol
But no sharing root passwords!
or scrolling on apple mice!
I don't want to see any fanfiction with my name in it on your hard drive
:P
You won't
I'm not a fanficer
:P
/me shared a root password with SR before
:O
You're outside the circle!
[censored]
Fortunately, nothing happened
no babies?
XD
Nuh uh
o.I
XD
*o.O
A combination between awesome and a douche
ew
was that censored?
except their gender
it would be a one sided relationship
XD
/slapped
while SR works all day and has no time for the family
:P
relationships with SR = always one-sided
I would know
<.<
:o
:P
kind of
Nah, he never trusted me that much
He'd flip out if I so much as implied not trusting him though
eh what are we talking about
guess
Aww, he can't guess anymore
well he can guess the rest
lol
Before it's too late
Do it now
D:
I'd tend to agree
and give proof
Mah Spywoah
but he does support our two servers right now
and we should run that as far as we can
blarg
03wow, Sci-Fi channel has really weird commercial placement
Yes
blarg
03the usual commercial-detecting scan has failed on almost every break
If only I were rich and server-savy
:P
Hehe, Epic Chat is sponsored by Spyro Forums :D
/me is also neither
I can sponser it :D
I actually offered him ad space once, but he refused it
He's like Darth Vader, there's some good in him, I just know it :D
I've seen the good in him
so have I
/me will seriously rage if he sees one more Progressive insurance ad
It's... just not enough
but far more bad then good
<.<
03...they showed TWO IN A ROW
03yeah, that's seriously annoying XD
12lolz
03we have Allstate o.,o
03*o.o
D:
03it's of my opinion that good products shouldn't need to be advertised
03or at least not every 2 minutes LOL
Haha
03Micro Center doesn't advertise, and they're SO much better than Best Buy
12We're progressively showing more pregressive to progress in out progressive progress to conquer the progressing world o3o
/me shot
03LOL
It counts as proof of his good programming skill
:3
but Ravioli is smarter
so Things > SR
haha
good logic
and 5 > 16
in some parts of the world
also very good logic
(Australia)
03LOL random ads for getting free money
03I hate those too
03"You can get a NEW laptop ABSOLUTELY FREE!" Um no? As soon as you get one you have to pay them back, with interest >_>
(and Canada)
03but they live off duping people apparently
(and Wisconsin)
o.o
All three of those places have poor mathematical skills

What's "Napoleon's Force"?

it's a line that Napolean crossed while making his empire
history ner stuff
*nerd
or something like that
I don't get it
I don't think it's really meant to be funny, just a reference to history
I have no idea though
What is "retrograde" I wonder

that's what I've been thinking lately actually
deal with nights for a month or so

Angry speeches are sooooo awesome in German

Love songs are good in French
04personally I like NCIS better
06meh
06I never got into NCIS as much
06even though I do like it
And if you reverse it, it's funny
03I don't really watch CSI and such
Angry + French == funny
I like pitching songs to be really low then really high
04I don't watch it regularily
04just if I'm ever heading to bed and I see mum and my sis watching it, I ask if I can watch it before going to bed XD

04EWWWWWW
04JUSTIN BEIBER
uggggh too hard to make a depressing video when there are only so many depressing scenes in this movie :| [censored] footage limit
07lol
D:
no
ERWW JUSTIN BEBER
Basically, you know a certain amount of people, which is the first degree, then everyone else that your friends know counts as the second degree, etc
03OK like
03my friend's girlfriend is completely random
03"cleaning my room :O....i was attacked by a vicious spider this morning :S....now i must clean the kitchen too! If anyone is reading this....gimme a call! love it when pple call :D"
So the second degree is "friends of friends"
04lolwut
The third degree is "friends of friends of friends"
etc
03that's her actual status update
...ok
:P
Someone theorized that the sixth degree is everyone in the world
thats possible
So, "friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends" encomp[censored] the entire planet
unless you live on like a farm and everyone only knows the people around them
Including people such as the President of the USA, and some random guy in Bejing, China
lol
I actually calculated it, and the President of the US is four degrees away :3
Which means he's five degrees at most from you and everyone in here
it'd be cool if he didn't suck
me => President of my college => Bradley Byrne => Gov. of Alabama => President
awesome
So I definitely think that sexth degree thing works
sixth**
/me hides
perhaps
yeah but I don't see the hype about him
/me is having fun with that
lol
/me pokes the chat
/me pokes back

Notable Failure of the week: I gave my dad my old laptop a while back and apparently just a week ago his sound was working perfectly fine. Then recently, it just stopped working. No program noises, system noises, music; nothing. Well, it turns out that the volume dial on the laptop itself was turned all the way down. Not anything software related; the physcal volume wheel was turned down. Fail.

12Wow

2I found it on DA, Arti. ^^ Want a link to it?

12No point

/me flooooooof
2LOL XD
/me chews on a spoon
Heyyyy
what up
:D
Got the job at Walmart
YAY
:D
Now I get to cleanm toilet bowls during the late hours of the night!
And get money of course
Hey
ewww
D:
And how are you today?
lol, it's mainly cleaning floors actually
well I guess someone's gotta go it..
/me should draw more of her dragoness named Nebula
I'm doing well; I got a job finally
how about you?
Haha, I suppose
I'm fine, though not much has happend to me.
to ask again: Arti, are there any noise regulations for private planes in england?
12Not sure sorry
That's good
I'm so bored
what else is new??
well, we even have different prices for landings
Uhhh
unfortunately nothing really
D;
How about you?
/me floofs Arti
nothing really here either...
I suspect there are
trying to think of things to do during the weekend...
I hate boringness lol
12^^
12I need to go
Ah
like - a Cessna 172R - for being noise-reduced to the max - would be 6.50 EUR, whilst a louder Piper would be 9.75 EUR. And a no noise-reduced plane would even be 19 EUR and up
I have a couple graduation parties I may go to
plus - all other planes have strict regulations when to start and to land
when you say that do you mean teenagers illegally getting drunk and crazy? :P
No
lol
[censored].
if I did mean that I wouldn't be going
lol
fail :P
less of a "party" and more of the kids' parents just getting an excuse to get all the relatives together
hahahahahahaahahhh I hate that
XD me too
12I'm off out
and - if you takeoff, you need to stay away of the airport for at least one hour
12Seeya later
"Aren't you a little old to be drinking illegally, Mr. Griffin?" "Uh, no..."
I can't stand any of them
kk - rest well Arti
Hahaha
*one
Family Guy?
Yeah. I thought Griffin was a dead giveaway.
yup
2Bye Arti. *hugs*
That's what gave it away
:P
7blah blah blah mister freeman
because of those limitations I'm currently looking for a very, VERY noise-reduced plane. I can freely takeoff and land with it on every airfield then
Bye Articuno
Cessna o3o
owwww I'm getting one of those things where you feel like you're getting prricked at in the chest
7I'm convinced there's only six episodes of trigger happy TV and I've seen them all
Hahaha
They keep replaying them?
7I wonder when they'll be releasing the next series of misfits
7and yeah
I think the show's over
I don't think they make it anymore
well, I'd prefer a Piper
I don't think I've ever gotten that
srsly o_O
Lol, yeah. It doesn't sound familiar anyway
it happens to some people every once in a while
it sucks you can barely move til it's done
can't breathe too deep or it hurts
Like heartburn?
7... which one?
Trigger Happy TV
idk what hearburn feels like
7ah
7probably
Oh, because I get that a lot
god dammit my cat knocked over all my cds
Uh oh
ok back
hopefully none of them fell out of the cases and got scratched
nah they were on the floor already
I broke my dance gavin dance cd case the other day :( sucks it's part of my jc collection
7DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.
/me 7works on new sprites D<
hai Quan
hey quan
jc collection?
jewel case?
jonny craig
oh
XD
hey Brother
I love collecting all the projects and cds and demos n shhit of all the hard to find artist deals
if that makes sense
it does
sounds like a fun hobby too
lots of projects they all have so I try to get the cds of them all
How do you find the rare ones?
2Gah! I hate having a dry throat. DX
and I have all of ag's things on my computer from downloads but I don't have hard copies of them all
used CD stores
trying my best not to use ebay but it might come down to it
Every single song of his?
AG's I mean
ummm probably not every including live covers and stuff but off all his project albums/eps/demos yes
actually that's a lie I need one audience of one demo
Oh wow, I'm amazed you have all the demos
...nevernmind
XD
it's unreleased but it's on torrents and stuff somewhere I think
Ah
7o3o
7Who took the new pokemon's na,e?
7name*
7Busy.
/me 7shrugs
7I've only got 15 minutes before I AFK.
He's like all The Quiet Ones
yup
how'd i forgot the tsoaf cd I don't have that on here either ><
sometimes I like the wait to find stuff
7The tuft on the new pokemon's belly looks... O_o
Yeah, the anticipation makes it exciting
I guess
or potentially makes the music more worth it
Its driving me nuts waiting for tsoaf one to come floating along, last time i was at silver platter's they had the two that I did have and not the one I needed :(
Oh, that sucks
fate was against you that day
:P
yep
went to 2 SP's that weekend neither of them had it
2Yeah, it looks questionable. o_O
got lots of other crap though :D
is Silver Platter a used CD store?
yeah there's only 3 of them
o3o;
i'd totally live there
:D
all of them out west?
no just in washington as far as I know
Ah
one's down the road from the needle one's in northgate and one's in bellvue not that it matters
been to them all though
I don't think we even have a store that sells used CDs around here lol
and if we do the selection would be awful
so the reason I always get assloads of cds every time is because usually the ones I get are like 5 bucks each
Oh, nice deal
we usually only get full priced ones if it's rare/we've been looking for it everywhere
7DANG YOU, PIANO. D<
I think the lowest I've ever gotten was this EP for 1 cent
Oh wow
for a band called the graduate that opened for ludo at a show i went to a couple years ago
I flipped out
Are they a pretty small time band?
uhhhh I have no clue they've had adds in band magazines and stuff
Ah

but yeah we'll go to these stores and get like 20 cds at a time for maybe 50 dollars, at regular prices you could only get 5 for that much
Evening guys, ;)
well depending on the artist and how popular they are
Oh yeah
that too
at fye I saw a cd by Brand New for 20 bucks but at SP's we found the same one but the full price there was 10
so altogether that place is cheap as hell :D
The thing that sucks around here is that if you want more than Walmart's CD selection you have to drive an hour to Best Buy
I NEVER buy cds at walmart and you shouldn't either because
me neither
way overpriced
:o
if you do they not only censor anything slightly wrong, but they REVERSE it and it goes WAY out of sync
sounds like shhit
Oh really?
I knew they censored it
but not that they reverse it
yup for my 10th birthday my parents didn't know walmart did that and a few songs were totally out of sync so it wasn't enjoyable
><
/me yawns and starts napping
I rarely even buy music but when I have it's been from either Target or Best Buy
I've only gotten a cd from best buy once just because it had bonus tracks you couldn't get anywhere else...eh it's ok really bare though
target is pretty bare too
lots of the stuff I'm into can't really be found in those places unless it starts to have good sells in general
Best Buy has the best selection you can find offline around me
Ah yeah
the only place where I can find a few bands that I like that isn't SP's is hot topic ><
Ugh
Hot Topic
that's a pretty good place to get cd's though too they're usually priced well
Yeah, I saw a few Alkaline CDs there once
but I hate the place XD
eh it's alright when it's not full of "OH MY GOD MY LIFE SUCKS COZ I'M SO EMO" kids
Yeah
They have good T-shirts too
not as cheap as I like
I got a hoodie there the other day for 10 bucks that looks like a shark's eating my face :D
Hahahaha
that's awesome
my mom and I are huge bargian hunters we always raid the sales racks and end up finding great stuff everywhere...
2EEK!!!! O_O Reshiram is on the cover for Pokemon Black and Zekrom is on the cover for Pokemon White.
Lol, I hope you're not the type of bargain hunters that buy things you normally wouldn't just because they're on sale
no not like that :P
07lolduh
07late
07o3o
Lol, that's like my mom
my mom's like that with groceries but with nothing else aha
Extra groceries never hurts though
:P
unless it goes old
:P
my uncle's still [censored]ed that I ate the bacon off the counter :|
O.o
it's like he should have said something, I mean it was just sitting there...o__o getting cold...
I couldn't let that happen! D;
Wasn't that like last night?
yeah it was last night
Strange thing to stay mad about
this week's been a terrible week social wise for me
Yeah I know what you mean
mine's been kinda crappy these last few days too
like everything I do or say is wrong
he's mad at me for dumb stuff because he can't control his own kids so he tries to control us even though we don't need controlling
I mean I'm not hopping on buses in the middle of the night to see "friends" like his daughter is
12Back....
/me eyerolls
Oh wow
12Just heard the weirdest thing..
how old is she?
12Out in the hills
/me tries to figure out what it was
turned 13 a few days ago
it'd probably be different if she was older
but [censored]
:|
yeah, that's crazy
her neighbor hood is NOT safe either
hi Arti, and ok
it's like a white ghetto
and he just lets her go out on her own at night?
no
her mom does
Ohhh
he doesn't live there :P he lives here
okay, that makes sense then
the mom just doesn't care
and his daughter got all mad because they put a lock on her window and she ran away the other night, and that's when she had to come here for that one day
and he gets stresed because there's nothing he can do about it
Oh yeah
I pretended to sleep with my sungl[censored] on so she couldn't see me watching her on her phone, I was listening in and apparently she hid in some bush for like 2 hours
Jeez
To be honest I never understood the need to run away from home at that age
where could you possibly go?
it's funny;; he used to complain all the time about his son being so addicted to video games that he wouldn't go anywhere, but I bet he's wishing his daughter was like that now too
Haha yeah
"the hills are alove, with the sound of something wierd,,,"
to her friends house probably she has like 50 bajillion friends
/me rusn
I really wouldn't be suprised if she was pregnant before age 15
>.>
that bothers me
kids that young getting pregnant
yup.
seriously they need to move bad
Get to a safe neighborhood?
or at least get away from everyone there
I barely know her friends but I can already tell they're not the type of people she should be hanging out with
Yeah
12LOL!!
/me jams to Don't Lose My Number <3
/me sits all over Articuno
/me flicks Kyu off

/me squishes Articuno and Kyu
what's your favorite song of Phil Collins, Arti?
Hmmmm
Oh I know
12Ooooh.. hard one..

what would be a good place to find a copy?
12Another day in paradise or I wish it would rain down
both good ones ^^

favorite Gensis song?
unless you wanna go to some japanese site and pay 50+ bucks for it
*Genesis
Aww that sucks

12Domino
12I can't choose
lol
How long until you're done for the summer?
I love In Too Deep and Jesus He Knows Me
I still have no clue
I also love Land of Confusion <3
the calendar goes all the way til august but I know I don't work all summer, next time the teacher calls my mom's gonna bring that up
it's nice knowing someone who loves Phil's musica as well... I really don't know any one irl ^^;;
12Oh yeh I love Jesus he knows me, that's such a dancy song
I've always wondered how homeschooling works, so there's a teacher that sends your mom the lesson plans?
Guess what
ehhhh
huhzah?
it depends what type of homeschooling, this is the first year I've done online schooling
I got the job
AWESOME
as the toilet boy?
for 5th and 6th grade I did workbooks and took the tests at the alternative school around exam times
Unfortunately
yes
hmm
i know and hai Shiny
or are you just the scrubber dud
02Hey
*dude
both
ah
but mainly floor sweeper
and I'll be honest I HATE this online school crap I wanna go back to the books it was a hell of a lot less of a hassle
and yes, Home By the Sea and Second Home By the Sea are epic songs
Hahaha
Is it less efficient?
good.. maybe you wont be forced to do back breaking labor... maybe just foot numbing walks
but this way I don't have to take the regular exams, I take some sort of other test at the end of the year or something instead
12Heh I just count them as the same song ^^
02Oh, Arti, you wanna see the Lugia I drew?
A final basically?
12Yes ^^
naw, ones the lyrics, the others practically a melody with no lyrics until like the last minute
ii hate online school...
i like the second one better, tbh
idk I've never done this crap before
brb
12Yeh but I count it as the same because it's as if the first song doesn't actually end but just carries straight onto the second
02http://i48.tinypic.com/nd9d07.jpg
not on my disc is doesn't
12Ah
12Also WEIRD LUGIA
02It's Altair

I also love No Reply at All and... what is that song? Oh! Lonely Mn on the Corner.... I LOVE that song ^v^
*Man

03despite the fact that it's HALF ICE
06like 4 reshiram/zekrom fan clubs have asked for my picture to be in their club
/me huggles 02 back
06one day, 4 clubs
03I'm like "Jeez, I'm 19, canm't you treat me like an adult?"

7Issan Absol/Garchomp/Lugia/Palkia.
Quan: they are?
03so what if I'm overweight, I like my pop ktyhx
03-y
/me likes the look of Reshiram better o3o
03I kinda don't like either
7So do everyone else.
03I really thin the new generations of Pokémon are retarded
7Zekrom reminds me of Machinedramon.
03the games are fun but the creatures are just WTF
03I'm one of those "Original 150 or GTFO"
03though I'll extend that to 386 as I liked the 2nd and 3rd-gen ones too
034th-gen was like, WTF
that was a intersting episode
12SKY!
/me huggles~
10:3
That happens to me a lot
03argh
03I now officially hate Starz and Encore
03(the movie channels)
03I can't record anything off there without it locking me out of editing the file x.x
drf: it is really called Starz and encore?
03Starz is one channel
03Encore is another channel
03they're 'sisters' though, both are owned by the same company
03and they're technically 'premium' cable (like HBO and such), but my cable company gives them to us for free XD
03but shame, I want the movie Hollywood Homicide in high-definition :(
03there's no Blu-Ray of it... but it airs on Starz HD
03but if I can't USE the recording, wtf good is it
06LOL
06someone commented on my reshiram picture
04Oh, I thought you were laughing at me ;3;
06they said that they better not pull off a team aqua/magma thing in these games and use the names "team black ninja and team white monk"
03Yes, we're laughing at you
06in all honesty, those team names would make me laugh
03because you joining the channel is simply hilarious
06team black ninja ftw
12<late>ohai Pokestar~
tat reminds me of Destry all humans 2 XD
the white ninjas and black ninjas
who used to follow a grey ninja for some reason
12o.o
06s it just me
12?
06or do the new legendaries both look like something that would be related to digital stuff
/me nods
04Oh, wow. I've been dead lately, I didn't know they revealed them |:
12they do o3o
06I can see the black one totally
what happened to tha stormies
06but then I noticed the white one's tail
/me has been living under a rock o3o
06looks alot like a computer chip
06it was just today
She can't get her microphone working
12:o
ah
I think she had to restart because she downloaded a driver
04Still, considering its 5:00 and I've heard nothing *shrugs*
but then again I couldn't hear her so I'm only guessing that's what happened
lol
06I am so sick of people saying "they look to similar to each other
/me thinks the dark one looks somewhat like Palkia o3o
06same
06and I see reseblance in the white to palkia as well
06but it doesn't bother me one bit
/me personally just finds all 5th gen Pokémon stupid and lame
12ah
03even Zoroark
/me prepards to be murdered
12lol
03it just looks like recycled ideas to me
03seriously
/me lols randomly
04I'm glad you made that picture, because if I just saw the offical art, I would have never bought those games. I don't like the offical art -3-;;
03OMFG A PENGUIN... what?
12SO many suggestive things in a single afternoon...
04eh?
7o3o
/me dies
12BL came over, and her, myself, my sister, and her friend all said VERY suggestive things for a long time lolz
04Most of the pokemon released don't amuse me, either, drf
03LOL, I didn't say amuse
7Go to HoR, LL. o3o
03I just don't like them
03I mean, I'll buy B/W when they come out
03because I'm a collect
12I am, Quan
03*collector
/me wonders if he's the only one here who doesn't like HoR
04Quan
12you're not, drf
04wait nvm
04Nope, most people don't either
03XD
/me doesn't care what other think, tbh
12lolz
12same
12well, for SOME things o3o
/me hides
7B/W seems to be a battle between nature and technology, the new pokemon seem to imply .o3o
old people
"You've never not seen anything like this!"
04I can see that
/me nods
7Another artificial legendary, perhaps? O3o
04Might be, created by the bad guys or something
12maybe the Black Version one is the "God of Change"
/me shot
04lol
7Does Zekrom only have one horn? o3o

Okay, who's me?
04Yeah

13You should use Abby off of NCIS's remady
12???
/me doesn't watch NCIS
04@what you said LL
12oh
Pysch, if anyone was curious.
Curious about what?
The above.
Ah
Also, just so you know, you're my 100th friend
So you're like a chosen one or something
:P
dude, that reminds me.
Hmm?
This kid made a serious funny yesterday in my math class. Unintentionally, which is the best way in my opinion.
Haha
what was it?
completely serious review before finals, and the teacher ask him which term goes with one she was pointing to on the board, and he responds:
"the Chosen One," under his breath, and everyone asks what he said and he gets all defensive. "Nothing!"
So the remaining time in the class was spent trying to figure out why he said that, while he denies every saying it.
Hahahahaa
Nice
04hey Feather
But it was just so weird because he mumbles it, and the teachers like "did he just saying The Chosen One?" And this kid goes "Isn't that a movie?"
03what a stupid question
03* How much experience do you have using high-speed duplicators and copiers (e.g., all-in-ones, fax machines and photo printers)?
XD
03I've been using printers all my life LOL
12Feather!
12hai~
12<lte>
12*late
13Hello Ms. Feather
:P
Did you ever figure out why he said that?
No, he denies it all. xD
I think he just misspoke and was all embaraseed.
hi Feather
/me is also late
*embarassed
10hihi
Lol, probably
12Ms o.o
At first I thought he was trying to say coefficient.
/me eye-rolls
03Microsoft what?
/me hides
Hmm
Would make sense
/me LOLs at "MS Word"
03didn't realize that program was female
03but apparently she is
03:P
So now the teacher rides on him every day for it. xP
03owwwww wtf
03one of my fingers just started searing in pain
MS Word... I dislike it... yet I also like it. Heh.
03WHY
03WOrd 2000 is like the best thing ever
03Office 2007 just fricking sucks and I hate it
03but the CLASSIC MS Office... :D
Office 2K7 = No.
03precisely
12blah
032000 is my favorite
12Ms Word x.x
Office 2K3 = Yes, please, let me keep using Office 2K3.
032003 is alright too, but that's more or less the same thing
03well
032003 is just 2000 with a prettier interface
True.
03and since I HAVE 2000... that's what I use
03plus
03PowerPOint 2000 had one thing 2003 didn't
03and that's auto-animations
Also, I do have a legit(ish) 2K3 Enterprise disc set. Hehe.
03XD
03I have Office 2000 Pro
03which was copied FROM a legit disc
03my uncle owns it, and he just made us a copy
03and yay 2000 software, none of that activation crap
03I just use his serial and bingo XD
So, what up with thou?
Same for 2K3. :P
03Actually, no.
03well
03the original release of 2003, yes
Ummm
03but recent copies have activation
03I have FrontPage 2003 that I got from MSDNAA and it DOES need to be activated
Nothing much... Thou?
I got the 2K3 copied from a legit university distribution (i.e. no activiation).
