<Yahoo> Took a while to reply XD
<xDeathBat> 10aw crap

<EclipsedMoon99> Olleh.
<Aicebo> 13hello
<EclipsedMoon99> Hey.
<Cynder7> 6-_-
<Cynder7> 6Wb
<xDeathBat> 10?
<Cynder7> 6*sighs*
<Aicebo> So /notice prince-dari ?
<EclipsedMoon99> Temperatures in the interior of the Earth are so high that the rock would melt if the pressure were not so great. Radioactive atoms break up at a slow rate, keeping the temperatures high. Some mantle rock partially melts (only some minerals melt) and forces its way up to the surface. The minerals in the mantle that melt are the silicon compounds that make up the Earth's crust.
<EclipsedMoon99> The density of rocks near the surface of the Earth is only about 3 times that of water, so the interior must be made of much heavier materials such as iron and nickel. The Earth's magnetic field shows that the core can hold or cause a strong magnetic field. Iron is the logical material, because of its high density and its magnetic properties.
<EclipsedMoon99> Bleh.
<xDeathBat> 10uh thats all accurate, but... why are you posting it? XD
<EclipsedMoon99> Because it just saved your lives.

<Cynder7> 6Awsome
<Cynder7> 6Welcome then
<Cynder7> 6I'll be back in a bit
<Kjakings> 7C7: The barries /do/ go down. The more lightning you shove in the meter the longer. You gotta go fast to get the key through though. Same thing as the raft but it's on rails.
<xDeathBat> 10http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Elvis_Presley_1970.jpg ohhhhhhhhhhh.
<XRedDragonX> hm
<xDeathBat> 10XD AHAHA.
<Cynder7> 6Thnx Kja!
<Cynder7> 6I'll try it in a bit
<Cynder7> 6I'm about to get the second last key and I'm being attacked by skeletons..
<Cynder7> 6Here goes..
<Cynder7> 6I tried putting the meter all the way down but the things just stayed there,I can't jump to them off the vines..
<Kjakings> 7Hmmm.... Which one are you doing, the really high bit?
<Kjakings> 7Have you got any of the mana upgrades?
<Cynder7> 6I'm at the part where I've just gotten rid of the skeletons and yes,I have
<Kjakings> 7Hmmm... I got no clue. It worked for me.
<Cynder7> 6Ok,let me try again
<Cynder7> 6Nothing
<Kjakings> 7Hold on. You're on one of the really high ones, correct?
<Yahoo> Back
<Cynder7> 6Also,There-
<Cynder7> 6What high ones?
<Kjakings> 7...
<Kjakings> 7You're in the Ruins of Warfang.
<Kjakings> 7Getting the statue keys
<Cynder7> 6Yeah
<Kjakings> 7There's 4.
<Kjakings> 7Two high ones.
<Kjakings> 7Two low ones
<Kjakings> 7Which are you on?
<Cynder7> 6I've gotten the two closest to the center and the smaller on on the right side of the doors
<Kjakings> 7That's not helpful at all. I mean the keys. To get the keys you have to go to a high or low area. Which-are-you-on?
<Cynder7> 6Ok,you want me to tell you which keys I've gotten? *kinda_confused*
<Kjakings> 7No.
<Aicebo> 13gotta go guys, bbl
<Kjakings> 7To get to the keys, you have to go either HIGH (^ that way) or LOW (v that way). Which way did you go for this one?
<Cynder7> 6Bye
<Cynder7> 6Low
<Cynder7> 6Left side of the door
<Kjakings> 7Erm...
<Kjakings> 7I dunno

<Kjakings> 7And dari: no, it wasn't written about you. Because the first line is "When the devil is too busy."
<EM99> OK.
<Kjakings> 7And you're the devil, so, unlucky.
<EM99> Lol, Voltaire.
<Kjakings> 7Voltaire is awesome
<EM99> Nope, dari.
<Kjakings> 7No. Death is my alter ego. This was written about KJA.

<EM99> Yeah, oops.
<EM99> Nope.

<Kjakings> 7Actually, it's "When there's grannies left to trip down the stairs" and then launches in the next line without a pause
<EM99> I see.
<EM99> Evevn better though.
<EM99> *Even

<Icydragon> 12I'd like that.
<Kjakings> 7Icydragon	I feel so used. So does poor Iggay
<Icydragon> 12.........
<Icydragon> 12I didn't mean to.
<Kjakings> 7He doesn't care.
<Kjakings> 7He intends to kill you then kill himself.
<lilgti> who??
<Kjakings> 7I WILL AVENGE IGGAY
<EM99> KJA, did you get lilgti's personal crap yet?
<Icydragon> 12Yeah it is.
<lilgti> what
<Kjakings> 7Oh yeah Icy, you /just/ missed C7. She must've sensed you coming and fled for the hills.
<Kjakings> 7It wasn't me this time.
<EM99> We can't do that anymore?
<Spyrorocks> No
<EM99> OK.
<Kjakings> 7SR: We can do it to proven n00bs, right?
<EM99> He is a proven noob!
<Spyrorocks> No more of this crap.
<Kjakings> 7But don't we want to get /rid/ of n00bs? This /is/ the most effective way. For proven n00bs only.
<EM99> ^ Truth
<Spyrorocks> We want more regular members.
<lilgti> no i didnt work this time
<Spyrorocks> and you guys scare them away.
<Spyrorocks> Scare any more possible spyrochat regulars away and ill ban you.
<EM99> Lilgti counts as a reg. memeber? 0_0
<EM99> *member
<Kjakings> 7We only scare away the n00bs. No chatroom wants to be filled with n00bs just for more regulars.
<lilgti> tell it like it is brotha
<lilgti> yes ..yes i am
<Spyrorocks> Kjakings: Re-read what I said.
<Spyrorocks> Im sick of it, so it ends now.
<EM99> M'k.
<Kjakings> 7Mmkay
<EM99> Can I have a list of n00bs we're allowed to scare?
<Spyrorocks> List as follows:
<Spyrorocks> =====start of list=====
<Spyrorocks> ======end of list=====
<Spyrorocks> There.
<lilgti> w00t
<EM99> Awesome can;'t wait till they get on.
<EM99> :P
<lilgti> haha
<Kjakings> 7I think Ayumi should be shoved in a lil' nook in that list. For when the bans ivariably get whiped again.
<Spyrorocks> I don't care what you do to previously banned members.
<EM99> xD Can't wait till "=====start of list=====" and "======end of list=====" get on.
<lilgti> heyyyyyy
<Spyrorocks> Banned members forfeit any sympathy I have.
<Rurik> 4O_o
<lilgti> rurik watching from the sidelines....
<EM99> And he scores.
<lilgti> ding ding ding
<EM99> Fries are done?
<Icydragon> 12No.
<lilgti> TKO!!!
<Icydragon> 12They are not.\
<lilgti> kidding kidding
<EM99> Hallo DDR_Pyromanica.

<DDR_Maniac> Just uploading another video
<EM99> Hmm? Your accent is ahrd to decipher.
<EM99> *hard
<lilgti> am i really that hard
<EM99> xDDDDDDDD
<lilgti> i coulnt resist
<lilgti> er however you spell it
<lilgti> btw basin 4 God
<EM99> lilgti, if you were so scared before of us, why'd you put a pic of you up on SF?
<lilgti> i dont know i have adhd
<EM99> That doesn't even make sense. Why woudl that make you do that?
<lilgti> no sometimes i do random stuffg i knew i had it
<Kjakings> 7ADHD doesn't make you do thinks. ADHD means Attention Deficit Hormonal(I think) Disorder. My brother has it.
<EM99> I see. Now, are you aware, then, that Dari is a flaming homosexual?
<EM99> Hyper.
<EM99> Not hormonal.
<Icydragon> 12He was....
<lilgti> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<lilgti> !!!
<DragonFireOKN> 2I was cleaning my ferret cage.
<EM99> GASP!!
<lilgti> thats not good
<DDR_Maniac> Bahh...
<EM99> prince-dari What? You know it's true.
<Kjakings> 7Oh yeah. Hyperactivity.
<DDR_Maniac> Clicked the back button
<lilgti> ok
<Icydragon> 12You said you weren't Dari.
<Icydragon> 12........
<lilgti> i is so e-scard
<EM99> Dari: Not in front of the kids!
<Icydragon> 12I thought you hid the kids?
<EM99> But the dark forces came.
<EM99> :P
<DragonFireOKN> 2No offense, but a lot of people on here act like kids.
<lilgti> hey what about that thing a little while ago prince-dari was doing
<EM99> I am a mkid. *shrug*
<EM99> *am a kid
<DragonFireOKN> 2Kids defined as "immature"
<EM99> Yeah, still I am.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Age shouldn't matter on the web.
<Kjakings> 7If you want mature conversation then go bugger off and leave us to our random.
<DragonFireOKN> 2You should know how to act.
<lilgti> yeah... RANDOM!!
<Kjakings> 7We prefer the random to mature or coherent conversation.
<EM99> Coherent yes, completely mature or organized; certainly not.
<DDR_Maniac> Who's "we"?
<lilgti> randoM ... AVOIDING MATURE RANDOMOCITY
<EM99> Me and your mom.
<Icydragon> 12I'm not in the random mood.......
<Kjakings> 7You're only ever onl ike once a week, so I can't be bitc- moaned at for 'scaring' off a regular.
<Icydragon> 12I'm scared.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I used to come on a lot more.
<lilgti> who isnt?
<Spyrorocks> I don't have the expectations that a conversion should be mature in a chatroom devoted to a purple dragon videogame chatacter.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Then it started to get weird and everyone argued all the time.
<Aicebo> 13Hey
<EM99> I'm not scared of this chat... is that bad?
<DragonFireOKN> 2I never said it had to be mature.
<EM99> Hey Aicendro.
<Aicebo> 13>(
<DDR_Maniac> Hey Spyrorocks
<lilgti> no but im still somewhat scared of you
<DDR_Maniac> I had an idea for the sprite thing
<EM99> Oh, we're on good terms then.
<EM99> :P
<lilgti> yeah :)
<lilgti> :P
<DragonFireOKN> 2I just like it when the talk is understandable and isn't full of sex and such.
<DDR_Maniac> I agree
<lilgti> you dont under stand this ....S ....E.... X
<Kjakings> 7Actually, it's generally rape on here rather then sex.
<EM99> :P
<lilgti> j/k
<DDR_Maniac> ...
<Aicebo> 13...
<Aicebo> 13:/
<EM99> g2g be back after.
2is waiting for the day when some 12 year old gets on and hears more 12yr olds talking about rape.
<lilgti> SORRY :(]
<Kjakings> 7dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot
<Spyrorocks> "Keep it family friendly."
<lilgti> OTAY (sorry left caps lock on
<Kjakings> 7Hey! I take offence to that! I'm not 12!
<DragonFireOKN> 2You act like it.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I'm not saying all twelve year olds are like that.
<Kjakings> 7As I said earlier. if you want mature, coherent conversation, go find somewhere else to chat.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Aicebo doesn't act like that.
<lilgti> yeah when i was twelve girls had cooties
<Aicebo> 13I'm not 12.
<DDR_Maniac> Or...you could just go away, and we'd have a normal chat
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, but Aicebo's a mod and 11 so you've gotta take her out of the equation.
<DragonFireOKN> 2?
<lilgti> like last year
<DragonFireOKN> 2Aicebo became a mod because she knew how to act.
<lilgti> hahahaha
<Aicebo> 13lilgti: There is no such thing as "cooties", it's a baby kid thing that makes the opposite genders hate eachother and turn everyone gay.
<DragonFireOKN> 2She knows how to act. She's not even 13 yet.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I respect that.
<Kjakings> 7DDR_Maniac	Or...you could just go away, and we'd have a normal chat tsch. Normal? You think /Im/ the source of all this random crap? It was random the day I came on, and I'm damned sure it'll be random the day, and after I leave
<lilgti> you no i was just kidding RIGHT??
<DDR_Maniac> Whatever you say
<Aicebo> 13lilgti: No, I can't find sarcasm in n00b typing, sorry.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Although, Kjakings, when this site opened it wasn't like this.
<DragonFireOKN> 2You weren't here yet.
<DDR_Maniac> And there would be a lot less sweaing too
<DDR_Maniac> *swearing
<Kjakings> 7Meh.
<lilgti> kussing
<Aicebo> 13*cussing
<Kjakings> 7Ok seriously. Who THE HELL says cussing?
<Kjakings> 7Besides 80 year olds
<lilgti> whatever
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: I agree, the word "cussing" is stupid
<DDR_Maniac> Aicebo: Kick him plz.
<Aicebo> 13lolol
<lilgti> thats kinda why i put it out there
<DDR_Maniac> Kjakings:
<Kjakings> 7Lilgt. YOU HAVE DISGRACED MY PEOPLE! WE MUST FIGHT TO THE DEATH!
<Aicebo> 13*That's kind of why I put it out there
<Kjakings> 7lilgti*
<Aicebo> 13WITH MY MAGIC WOODEN SPOON I HOLD THE SPIRITS OF THE CABBAGE
<lilgti> who is this lilgt you speak of
<DDR_Maniac> Woot
<Kjakings> 7Heeeeeyyy...

<Kjakings> 7Hey. It was a quote
<lilgti> scare who away
<lilgti> i didnt leave ???
<lilgti> ok?
<Kjakings> 7It was a quote from a funny vid. Bloody hell.
<DDR_Maniac> -_________________________________________________________________________-
<Kjakings> 7I'll go and find the vid and link you to it if you want me to prove it.
<lilgti> otay
<DDR_Maniac> Go ahead
<Kjakings> 7Ok.
<Icydragon> 12Otay?
<DragonFireOKN> 2Is that from "300"
<DragonFireOKN> 2?
<Aicebo> 13No
<Kjakings> 7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhOSrdkqoQw
<Aicebo> 13It's from a youtube video called "Anime in a Nutshell"
<lilgti> have you not seen the movie the little rascals
<DDR_Maniac> Kjaking: You got kicked for saying this: "Ok seriously. Who THE HELL says cussing?"
<DDR_Maniac> Not this: "Lilgt. YOU HAVE DISGRACED MY PEOPLE! WE MUST FIGHT TO THE DEATH!"
<Aicebo> 13Hell isn't a cuss
<Kjakings> 7Hell is NOT a swear.
<DDR_Maniac> If it's used that way
<lilgti> piss isnt either ...so what
<DDR_Maniac> If you just talk about heaven and hell, then sure
<Kjakings> 7Hell is NOT a swear. No matter what way you use it.
<Aicebo> 13-____-
<lilgti> sure?
<Kjakings> 7Yes.
<Kjakings> 7I'm freaking sure.
<Kjakings> 7See! Even dari agrees.
<Aicebo> 13Hell is not a swear. Piss is not a swear. Crap is not a swear. Damn/Damned/Damnit aren't technically swears.
<Kjakings> 7GO! HAMMER OF TRUTH!
<Aicebo> 13Sooo.
<Kjakings> 7GO! HAMMER OF TRUTH!
<lilgti> are swears parts of speech ...kinda of topic but i want to know
<Aicebo> 13WHICH CARD WHICH CARD!?!?!
<DragonFireOKN> 2"Hell" can be used as a swear word to some people...but no one even considers it much of a swear word any more.
<Aicebo> 13"My nose is too big...I'm not even supposed to have a nose!"
<DragonFireOKN> 2Christians take offense to it....(Some)
<DragonFireOKN> 2Only if they say "What the hell"
<lilgti> i dont and im a CHRISTian
<Kjakings> 7If Christians want to get all fussy abotu religion over the INTERNET then I'm gunna say "Chuck Norris is the ONE TRUE GOD!" to them and let them choke on that.
<DragonFireOKN> 2You see litgti, that's why I used a word called "some"
<DragonFireOKN> 2It means not all.
<lilgti> sorry i didnt read the hole post
<Aicebo> 13*whole
<DragonFireOKN> 2Side-effect.
<Kjakings> 7Side-effect most likely.

<DragonFireOKN> 2Even before SR existed to bring order and peace to the galaxy.
<EM99> ^ LOL
<DragonFireOKN> 2Stormy wasn't there to ruin everything as well.
<lilgti> ohhhhhhh burn!!1
<raven> 5Back when Spyroforum was just a little country hippy western town
<EM99> Oooooohhh freeze
<DragonFireOKN> 2Dari: I never said how he would bring "peace"
<DDR_Maniac> I was there when it was like that
<lilgti> hahaha
<DDR_Maniac> and it was a hippy town with SFRB
<DDR_Maniac> XD
<lilgti> yeah like avalar
<raven> 5Yep... I miss her. Although TSIF has come back...
<lilgti> who is sfrb?
<EM99> I once eheard from this traveler who heard from another one who heard from his cousin who heard from his grandma who heard from her insurance agent that SF used to be a mining town before it was abandoned.
<DDR_Maniac> For a few posts
<EM99> *heard
<DragonFireOKN> 2There were two great forces of the sky.....the first was known as....DDR Maniac.....the second was known as......Stormy.
<EM99> Mata Nui and Makuta.
<EM99> Of course!
<DDR_Maniac> Actually, Stormy joined first
<DragonFireOKN> 2They ruled over the great land of Minnasota.
<DDR_Maniac> =P
<DDR_Maniac> *Minnesota
<DDR_Maniac> :D
<raven> 5One was queen and the other was king, eh?
<DragonFireOKN> 2It was intentional.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Minnasota.
<DDR_Maniac> No...
<DragonFireOKN> 2;)
<DDR_Maniac> Meenasooooota
<Aicebo> 13Bored......
<EM99> Derob.....
<EM99> How are you not enjoying this story Mikey?
<Aicebo> 13I'm just bored I dunno
<raven> 5Ruling out of Mineapollis, they held a tight firm grip of control over vast swathes of land
<EM99> You dunno, eh?
<EM99> EH?!?!?
<Aicebo> 13Eh!
<DragonFireOKN> 2However, there was a force much greater than DDR and Stormy.
<EM99> Makuta?
<lilgti> no... me
<DragonFireOKN> 2It was known only as...............................
<DragonFireOKN> 2Chanserv......
<EM99> Chuck Norris?
<Icydragon> 12........
<DDR_Maniac> Bot was soo much better
<Icydragon> 12That evil lifeless thing>?
<lilgti> EM99 akooona makuta
<DragonFireOKN> 2Chanserv brought wrath down upon the people of Minnasota
<Aicebo> 13http://i248.photobucket.com/albums/gg185/Aicebo/Other%20Stuffff/islandpenguin.jpg lololololol crappy penguin I drew on Paint
<EM99> No, actually Makuta is the villain in Bionicle lol.
<lilgti> i know i was just kidding
<DDR_Maniac> Whatever
<raven> 5You should load it onto deviantART Aicebo
<EM99> ORLY?
<DragonFireOKN> 2And only one person could stop him.....Rick Astely............and his apprentice.....
<DDR_Maniac> Bot disappeared and Chanserv came
<DDR_Maniac> So I assumed
<DragonFireOKN> 2Prince-dari
<Spyrorocks> Chanserv is just a network service for controlling permissions in channels.
<raven> 5Did DDR and Stormy resist the power of ChanServ?
<EM99> Have you found the tomes describing this?
<DragonFireOKN> 2Together, Stormy, Rick, and DDR destroyed Chanserv.
<Aicebo> 13RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR I'M EVIL

<raven> 5Lol I saw you call him that, on Ayumi's deviantART
<DragonFireOKN> 2Until they ran out of energy and SR revealed to them....
<lilgti> a fart
<raven> 5But alas, Canada's snow was melting! the reindeer couldn't go faster
<DragonFireOKN> 2that the chariot had a V8 under the hood.
<lilgti> along with a fart
<Kjakings> 7Why the hell does a chariot have a V8?
<Kjakings> 7How would that work?
<Rurik> 4Why not?
<Kjakings> 7It's a sleigh anyway right?
<Spyrorocks> Because V6 is too slow
<DDR_Maniac> The sleigh has a v8 holder
<lilgti> yeah why not a 302 small block ford
<DragonFireOKN> 2SR laughed at their pain and ran them over as he headed to his new kingdom-
<DragonFireOKN> 2gtg. (Pizza)
<Kjakings> 7THAT'S how tired I am and why I should be getting off. SR actually just pwnt me.

<XRedDragonX> apparently you are lol
<Aicebo> 13He says just now "It sure does exist"

<gerpie> i beleave God did let us born to come back to him but whe dont whe want to have fun on the world
<XRedDragonX> sudden
<XRedDragonX> and painless
<Aicebo> 13I doubt there is a God really
<gerpie> im sure there is
<XRedDragonX> hm
<Aicebo> 13If there is he sure doesn't give a shit about anything in our world
<gerpie> but if u dont beleave just dont
<XRedDragonX> we will never know until we die
<XRedDragonX> personally it shouldn't matter
<gerpie> yea
<XRedDragonX> everyone has their own views and that's it
<gerpie> so what u guys think of how the world begon?
<Aicebo> 13It just did
<Aicebo> 13End of story
<Aicebo> 13=P
<gerpie> -.-
<XRedDragonX> who cares lol
<XRedDragonX> the world is here and that's what matters lol
<gerpie> i do?
<gerpie> the world is coming to an end
<XRedDragonX> in that case it exists in whatever manner you believe lol
<Aicebo> 13"The Earth began as a tiny particle of matter that slowly begun to expand."
<Spyrorocks> Lots of people who enjoy intellectual discussions like questions like "where did the world come from".
<XRedDragonX> "slaps face"
<Aicebo> 13The world isn't going to end, that 2012 stuff is a bunch of bullshit
<gerpie> whoes face?
<Aicebo> 13It was supposed to end in 1984. It was supposed to end in 1999. It was supposed to end in 2000. Guess what. IT DIDN'T>
<gerpie> the bible did prophet about the econimic crisis
<Aicebo> 13It was supposed to end in 1984. It was supposed to end in 1999. It was supposed to end in 2000. Guess what. IT DIDN'T>
<XRedDragonX> I agree with that lol
<Aicebo> 13Ooh, the Bible, no one agrees with that
<XRedDragonX> ffs even if the world is gonna end we will all go up at the same time
<XRedDragonX> who cares
<gerpie> aice..
<Spyrorocks> The world is not going to end.
<Spyrorocks> At least not when man predicts it.
<gerpie> christianety is the largest religion on eart..
<gerpie> earth
<Spyrorocks> gerpie: How old are you
<XRedDragonX> so
<gerpie> sr im 14
<XRedDragonX> who cares so long as you live your life the way you want to lead it
<Spyrorocks> OK your one year younger than me.
<Aicebo> 13SR: I got a message back from AntR and he said Doppel was both genders...sorta hahaha
<gerpie> why you ask?
<XRedDragonX> Islam
<Spyrorocks> Islam or some other Indian religion is bigger because theres more people back east.
<gerpie> prince it is
<Aicebo> 13"it's the closest person to me!"
<gerpie> christianety gots 2billion and islam 1.8billion
<XRedDragonX> Islam is by far the largest
<Spyrorocks> Islam is larger because theres more people in a single area.
<gerpie> im not sure of that..
<Aicebo> 13gerpie: When was that written, 1987?
<XRedDragonX> go check it
<XRedDragonX> I'm telling you
<XRedDragonX> Islam is the largets
<XRedDragonX> "largest"
<Spyrorocks> Christianity is the most wide spread religion I would think.
<gerpie> and anyways
<gerpie> i cant beleave islam is the treu religion
<XRedDragonX> yes it is
<XRedDragonX> their is no true religion
<Aicebo> 13There is no "true" religion
<gerpie> there is
<Aicebo> 13-___-
<Aicebo> 13Nope
<XRedDragonX> why are we arguing about this?
<Aicebo> 13Because gerpie is a stubborn boy
<Aicebo> 13:P
<gerpie> ever sinse the beginning of the earth peaple prayed to Gods and these stuff
<XRedDragonX> apparently lol
<XRedDragonX> there have been thousands of interpretations of go
<XRedDragonX> d
<Aicebo> 13gerpie: Cavemen didn't know shit about God
<gerpie> they know there is something above there
<gerpie> but anyways
<XRedDragonX> "god"
<gerpie> after whe die whe see whoes rite and whoes wrong
<XRedDragonX> It's gonna be a different belief for everyone no matter what..so there is no use arguing about it
<Aicebo> 13Or when we die we're just dead and we didn't know we were alive :P
<gerpie> well find that out later
<XRedDragonX> "sigh"
<XRedDragonX> just believe whatever you want to believe
<Aicebo> 13I just believe there's a life after death, nothing about god or angels or anything like that though
<Spyrorocks> What would life after death consist of to you, Aicebo ?
<gerpie> red is right
<gerpie> lead ur lifes like u want to
<XRedDragonX> It doesn't matter in the end...then you will find out
<Aicebo> 13A world like this one without violence and all the other bad things out there right now
<XRedDragonX> I just live my life the way I want to lead it
<gerpie> what maded u beleave that?
<XRedDragonX> just personal belief
<gerpie> ok
<Aicebo> 13Myself.
<gerpie> what urself?
<Aicebo> 13I don't need to listen to things that random people made up a long time ago.
<Aicebo> 13Because there's no way I see how they can be true
<Aicebo> 13It all seems like a load of bull
<gerpie> cuz our brain is limited..
<XRedDragonX> hm
<Aicebo> 13No, it's not "limited"
<Spyrorocks> Imagine Infinity.
<gerpie> yes it is
<Spyrorocks> What does Infinity look like.
<Spyrorocks> Imagine Nothing. What does Nothing look like?
<Spyrorocks> The human mind is most certainly limited.
<XRedDragonX> lol
<Aicebo> 13LOL
<XRedDragonX> thank you for breaking that
<gerpie> what u mean by certainly?..
<Aicebo> 13Nothing looks like nothing at all, duh
<Aicebo> 13I can see it
<Aicebo> 13in my mind
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Spyrorocks> Darkness cannot exist in nothing.
<Aicebo> 13Just think about it and you can lol
<Aicebo> 13LET THE DARKNESS RISE
<Aicebo> 13lawl JK
<XRedDragonX> lol
<Spyrorocks> Darkness is something we perceive
<gerpie> well aicebo try to image that there whas no beginning and there is no end
<Spyrorocks> Therefor it is something
<Aicebo> 13gerpie: I can see that
<gerpie> lol aicebo u cant image it
<gerpie> cuz our brain thinks there always is a beginning
<gerpie> and there always be an end
<Aicebo> 13No, you do not know how my brain functions
<XRedDragonX> well this is quite the conversation
<Aicebo> 13You are not my brain
<gerpie> so?
<Aicebo> 13You cannot tell me what I can see and can't see.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Spyrorocks> Darkness is nothing?
<gerpie> no1 ever can image it
<XRedDragonX> everyone will perceive things they want to perceive them..that's human nature
<gerpie> anyways 1 thing is totally bullcrap to me

<SpyroForLife> I am often shunned at school. <.<
<SpyroForLife> For being a nerd..........
<gerpie> they dun call me nerd anymore
<EM99> 1. Emo is a genre of music not a type of person, and if you truly were what yuo call emo you'd know that. Also because it's so fake when people say they are so lightly.
<gerpie> cuz i got soem friends who do help me
<gerpie> some*
<SpyroForLife> And I am found weird because I am almost fourteen and I don't have a boyfriend.
<gerpie> thats why friends are nice
<EM99> Ugh, I hate what society has become.
<gerpie> i dun even really hadt a gf yet..
<SpyroForLife> But I find education a lot more important than a boyfriend.
<lilgti> i used to
<EM99> Kids at 9 eyars old are teased for not having a boyfriend/girlfriend
<SpyroForLife> And that's when people yell: " NERD!!"
<EM99> *years
<SpyroForLife> But anyhow... One day I should just turn around to the next person who calls me weird for not having a boyfriend, and say, " F*ck you."
<gerpie> well im glad i bike to school
<SpyroForLife> :3
<gerpie> cuz it keeps me healthly
<lilgti> that doesent work at my school i would het the crap beat out of me

<Kjakings> 7Oh jesus... damnit is NOT a swear.
<Kjakings> 7Bool lol
<Stormy> Yes it is.

<gerpie> im blind T_T
<Stormy> For crying out loud, you guys.
<Kjakings> 7I was not informed of this decision. I call for a meeting of the Elder Council to rectify this grevious mistake.
<Stormy> PG movies IN GENERAL then.
<Stormy> Gahhh
<lilgti> up at the top next to #spyrochat (12)
<lilgti> to the right of it
<Stormy> Kjakings, you are not funny.
<Stormy> At all.
<EM99> Hai.
<Stormy> >_>
<EM99> prince-dari I saw a PG movie where someone said OH SHI- Then got blown up. Lol, that reminds me of Transformers but that wasn't PG.
<gerpie> i dun see any spyrochat1 ;X
<gerpie> 12*
<lilgti> didit looks like a folder tab
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: It wasn't meant to be funny. It was meant to distract you and divert attention from the real (false. Damnit is NOT a swear.) issue, which it did until you forced me to do this explanation.
<lilgti> it looks like a folder tab
<gerpie> i see spyrochat
<gerpie> -gerpie xD
<lilgti> to the right
<Stormy> It is a swear.
<Stormy> It's not up to you to decide what is and what's not.
<EM99> Kja, what do you consider to be swears.
<EM99> ?
<Stormy> Ask "Cynderpebble" then.
<gerpie> lil is it that important/
<gerpie> ?
<lilgti> no its just areally cool free game
<lilgti> a really
<Stormy> I miss Bot ;-;
<gerpie> send it to me in sf
<Kjakings> 7SR, is damn/damnit a swear?
<Yahoo> Keeps doing the same Dari
<Stormy> It would kick people when they use swears
<lilgti> ok i will try hold on
<Kjakings> 7Spyrorocks. Is damn/damnit a swear?
<gerpie> sr isnt here ;\
<Stormy> His Gmail status is set to away.
<Stormy> Not here, I guess.
<Kjakings> 7Bugger
<Yahoo> It works now
<Stormy> How is it not a swear?
<Stormy> Just because it's not offensive to you doesn't mean it isn't one.
<Stormy> This isn't KjakingsChat, if you haven't noticed.
<Kjakings> 7Because it's just not! It's a curse, but not a swear.
<Stormy> Well, guess what/
<Kjakings> 7Even aicebo agrees on that.
<Stormy> ?
<Stormy> We have Americans here.
<Stormy> We're not all English.
<Kjakings> 7Really?
<Kjakings> 7Never noticed that
<lilgti> gerpie chaeck your sf inbox
<lilgti> check
<Stormy> Therefore, if it's a swear to a significant number of people, it is a swear.
<Stormy> Wow, that's pathetic
<Stormy> It's the same language.
<EM99> Kjakings Even aicebo agrees on that. Because surely Aicebo never agrees with KJ...?
<lilgti> i am
<Stormy> Yeah, and because Aicebo agrees it MUST be true.
<Stormy> >_>
<EM99> "Exactly." -KJ
<Kjakings> 7Dari: You really bloody know how to run a horse into the ground, then kick it beyond recognition.
<gerpie> wtf
<gerpie> that game xD
<EM99> xD
<lilgti> yes
<gerpie> its kinda nuts
<lilgti> its fun as heck tho
<Stormy> Just because it's not a swear to some people doesn't mean it isn't one at all. Therefore, if it's a swear to a significant number of people, it is a swear.
<Stormy> Now shut up :P
<Kjakings> 7All people who feel damn is a swear, say I (serious vote now Neon. No stupid jokes.)
<Stormy> -____________________-
<lilgti> EY
<Stormy> I
<Stormy> =P
<Stormy> But this isn't being put to a vote.
<Kjakings> 7You said if it's a swear to a significant number of people, then it's a swear. So we're taking a vote.
<lilgti> =I
<Kjakings> 7You said if it's a swear to a significant number of people, then it's a swear. So we're taking a vote.
<gerpie> flyer still whit us?
<Kjakings> 7All people who feel damn is not a swear, say I.
<Aicebo> 13Well gtg now.....
<Kjakings> 7I
<gerpie> aww
<Aicebo> 13Gotta get our tree...
<Stormy> Not necessarily the ones online at this time. >_>
<gerpie> cya aicebo D=
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo, is damn a swear?
<gerpie> ya
<Yahoo> THIS FEELS SO STRANGE
<Stormy> >__________________<
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: Nope.
<Yahoo> IM TALKING TO A MIC
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo, is damn a swear?
<Stormy> And like I said, just because some people don't think it is doesn't mean it isn't one.
<gerpie> aicebo it is
<Kjakings> 7prince-dari, is damn a swear?
<Kjakings> 7You said a significant number of people, therefore the majority. So we're taking a vote.
<gerpie> i think flyer is dead
<Kjakings> 7You've dug yourself a smooth, deep hole here stormy.
<Stormy> Significant number != majority
<Yahoo> KJ Damn isnt a swear
<Kjakings> 7Right. We have 2 votes yes, 4 votes no.
<gerpie> hey i cound for 7 ;X
<Kjakings> 7The majority says no
<Stormy> By significant number I meant society in general.
<Kjakings> 7...
<gerpie> xD
<Stormy> I don't mean a majority and I don't mean this chat.
<lilgti> gerpie you gonna get the game?
<Kjakings> 7Well we're gunna have to go by the society of spyrochat regulars.
<gerpie> naw sorry
<Stormy> No, we're not.
<gerpie> soon ill g2g to
<gerpie> almsot 1am xD
<lilgti> oh hahaha
<Stormy> We're going to have to go with what I say is appropriate because I'm an op and SR is not here.
<Stormy> When he comes back, take it up with him.
<Kjakings> 7So, you say something, then completely contradict it by "I R TEH MOD!!!111 YU DU WHT I SAY BECAUSE I R TEH MOD AND EVN IF I R WRNG I R STILL TEH MOD!!111"
<gerpie> haha
<gerpie> stormy is myghty xD
<Stormy> But I really don't see why it matters so much if one word is eliminated from your vocabulary in this chat.
<Stormy> How is is a contradiction?
<lilgti> yeah myghty
<lilgti> hahah
<Stormy> I said NOTHING about majority.
<gerpie> omg
<Stormy> I said SIGNIFICANT NUMBER.
<Stormy> NOT majority.
<gerpie> why did i type mygthy? ;X
<Kjakings> 7A significant number MEANS the majority of people.
<Stormy> Therefore, there is no contradiction.
<Stormy> Um, no it doesn't.
<lilgti> i dont no but it was funny
<Kjakings> 7Yes it does.
<Stormy> Are you aware of the meaning of the word "significant", or is that different in British English as well?
<lilgti> im gonna go play rigs of rods c ya

<Stormy> I mean, I'd be open to suggestions, but not "OMG U SUK FIX IT NAO!!!!!!!1"
<XRedDragonX> in that case I would just laugh in their face
<XRedDragonX> Fix it yourself
<Stormy> What's more annoying is when it's from people who have no idea how it even works or if it's even possible to fix it.
<Stormy> Just tell them to leave if they don't like it.
<Stormy> That's, like, Spyroforum's slogan now. =P
<XRedDragonX> simple
<Stormy> No one's forcing them to stay; if it's soooo annoying they're perfectly free to log out.

<lilgti> hi again
<spyrofan1990> Hey I am working on a spyro fanfiction but i need help with some of the character personalities. I know spyro and sparx but what are the other characters does anyone want to hear the plot
<lilgti> ok ...shot
<lilgti> shoot
<Aicebo> 13spyrofan1990: Sure. :_
<Aicebo> 13*:)
<lilgti> hey i have to go bi bi
<spyrofan1990> When spyro wakes up he is drenched in blood and the body of cynder is discovered (very gory) he freaks out and is soon discovered by hunter who shout that he murdered her but spyro insists that he did not
<Aicebo> 13Bi bi LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Aicebo> 13....I don't see how that can be a plot, I just see that as a scene.
<spyrofan1990> Okay the real thing is he is framed for a murder and is about to be killed when a pink dragon who looks very similer to him saves him and the two run off. Meanwhile a killer is loose and killing off various characters
<spyrofan1990> The dragon is a girl btw
<Aicebo> 13..........
<Aicebo> 13:/
<Aicebo> 13Can't help you there, sorry.
<spyrofan1990> I need help with personalities and the character not actual help with the plot
<islander66> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK0Atwu4OC8&feature=related
<spyrofan1990> The two are walking in the woods surviving in the wild while the dragon who saved him tells him a shocking secret about his past and who she is do you have any gueses
<spyrofan1990> Can someone tell me about each of the characters except spyro and sparx
<Aicebo> 13No, we can't, it's your story and not ours.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<spyrofan1990> I want to keep as many characters in the respective character otherwise i might be flamed or complained that someone is not the way they are supposed to be
<Aicebo> 13Then play the games and figure out what they're like :P

<Stormy> Never liked her.
<Stormy> She complained too much about her PMs being taken away.
<Stormy> Yeah, like that's gonna help you.
<Aicebo> 13And just because I'm arguing back she says "Look at who's older!" it's like I don't care how old you are you're annoying and pissing me off.

<EM99> Avoid direct contact with electricity. Electrical shock occurs when the current from an electrical source is allowed to flow through the body to the ground. Do not stick your fingers or anything other than a plug into a wall socket. Cover all unused sockets with plastic safety caps. Do not touch the prongs of a plug attached to a socket. Discard electrical cords with exposed wires or torn plugs.
<gerpie> is it there?

<Kjakings> 7Dari: The name mission impossible is misleading. If the misison is impossible, why attempt it, and why is there a "Mission Impossible 3"? I think they should be called "Mission quite tricky" or "Mission rather difficult", but I suppose that doesn't have the same ring to it.
<Ember> 6O___________o
<darkrath> or mission inprobable...
<Kjakings> 7C7: Yes, and you can't see it.

<DragonFireOKN> 2Hello
<Spyrorocks> In the past 2 days I have had 3 people that I have never met before invite me to go party with them.
<Aicebo> 13LOL

<Aicebo> 13Maybe they're ghey and think you're attractive or suttin lololololol

<Stormy> I thought you were talking about real life.
<Stormy> XD
<Spyrorocks> Naw no one likes me IRL
<Spyrorocks> JK more people like me IRL im just so awesome I don't give out my phone number.
<Aicebo> 13lol
<DragonFireOKN> 2No one acts like they do IRL when they are online.
<Aicebo> 13I do
<Aicebo> 13:P
<EM99> Seriously gonna rip out some hair.
<Stormy> I do
<EM99> NPL won't leave me aloooone.
<EM99> EPIC ALONE
<Aicebo> 13I NOW ANNOUNCE STORMY AND I WIFE AND WIFE
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOLOL
<EM99> Not just aslone, aloooooooooooone
<Stormy> No point in trying to be someone else online.

<DragonFireOKN> 2I pictured Stormy as a tomboy, but apparently I was wrong...
<Aicebo> 13HAHAHA

<Aicebo> 13HAHA
<Aicebo> 13:D
<Stormy> prince-dari: You were?
<Stormy> That's... disturbing.
<Stormy> :P
<Aicebo> 13:P
<DragonFireOKN> 2I don't talk much when IRL.
<DragonFireOKN> 2*in
<EM99> Isn't it prnounce?
<EM99> *pronounce
<Stormy> I don't either, DFOKN.
<Stormy> Only with people I know pretty well.
<Spyrorocks> Actually, I act very similar online as I do IRL
<Stormy> This is the real me who isn't afraid of being judged.
<Stormy> =P
<DragonFireOKN> 2Except when I'm in the....right company. (Stormy stole my line)
<Aicebo> 13Samelol
<Aicebo> 13I guess
<Spyrorocks> One thing I have learned is not to care what people think of you.
<EM99> Apprarently Microsoft and it's "infallible" IE was filled with viruses, even in gov. computers.
<EM99> Wow.
<Aicebo> 13I don't talk as much but I ACT like I do on here ololol
<DragonFireOKN> 2I never care what people think of me.
<Spyrorocks> Theres a new IE exploit out
<Spyrorocks> Neither do I.
<lilgti> hi im back
<Spyrorocks> But I do act really different then most other people I know... I just have a sort of unique personality.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Those who take the time to find things wrong with others' lives obviously don't have one to care about for themselves.
<Stormy> Yeah, I'm nothing like my friends at all.'
<Stormy> Or any other girl I know. =/
<Spyrorocks> I don't know anyone who shares my same interests IRL, so yeah.
<lilgti> who here knows what a ford bronco is?
<DragonFireOKN> 2I pull pranks too much.
<Aicebo> 13One of my e-friends and I are almost exactly alike :P
<DragonFireOKN> 2Is it Placedin, Aicebo?
<EM99> Lol.
<Aicebo> 13No :P
<EM99> Edina?
<EM99> :P
<Aicebo> 13Yeahlol
<Spyrorocks> haha
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Stormy> Yeah, it's so interesting how you can just happen to run into people who think exactly the same way you do on the internet.
<EM99> ^ yup.

<DragonFireOKN> 2I find this interesting...all of the mods think one of the other mods is bad...
<DragonFireOKN> 2think about it.

<Stormy> Didn't I tell you this already?
<Stormy> Hmm, maybe not.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Actually, Stormy just hates everyone.
<Spyrorocks> I don't think so...
<Stormy> But Razz is OK I guess.
<Stormy> She's not as bad as I thought.
<Stormy> Just overrated as an artist and kind of annoying with the crack pairings.

<DragonFireOKN> 2When does it lag?
<DragonFireOKN> 2I have the game and I've never had problems.

<DragonFireOKN> 2Aicebowned.
<lilgti> ooooooo gh
<EM99> I'm still right.
<EM99> It says "initially called GH4"
<Aicebo> 13:P
<EM99> So no.
<lilgti> no
<lilgti> yes
<EM99> Initially means it ONCE was.
<lilgti> no
<EM99> Wiki can be right.
<EM99> And this case it.
<lilgti> yes
<lilgti> \no
<DragonFireOKN> 2Its Guitar Hero: World Tour. Not Guitar Hero 4: World Tour
<Kjakings> 7No it's not
<EM99> I bet the official site says it isn't 4.
<lilgti> DFOKN: you are rightt
<Kjakings> 7No it's not
<Kjakings> 7No it's not

<lilgti> haha
<DragonFireOKN> 2The game's name is GH: World Tour
<lilgti> yes ...right!
<DragonFireOKN> 2Its codename was Guitar Hero 4.
<EM99> In your mind it can be.
<EM99> :P
<DragonFireOKN> 2What mind?
<EM99> No, it isn't.
<EM99> GHIII was the offical name.
<lilgti> whatever you ant it to be.....IMAGINATSHUN!
<lilgti> want
<EM99> it's on the frickin' cover.
<EM99> My friend has the game.

<DragonFireOKN> 2Its GH3: LoR
<EM99> Thanks.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Note the III.
<EM99> Roman numeral, lol.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Guitar Hero: World tour doesn't have a IV.
<EM99> Exactly.
<EM99> Theer are about 6 ones out.
<EM99> World Tour, On Tour, etc.
<darkrath> 3lol i started a debat...XD
<EM99> And Metallica coming.
<EM99> Also AAerosmith.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I'm using the official name from the official site...I can't be wrong
<EM99> *Mhm/
<EM99> Sure...
<DragonFireOKN> 2The official name counts...
<darkrath> 3world tour IS GH4, but they named it World tour, same thing, it's just a effin game...
<DragonFireOKN> 2I never said it wasn't called GH4 often...but the name is GH: World Tour
<EM99> Of course it's the fourth game, only it is a 'new series' I guess.
<EM99> Because it's not numerically inclined.
<EM99> Whatever.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Yeah, its the fourth game.
<EM99> Damn this.
<DragonFireOKN> 2lol
<EM99> No, it'd be the fourth GH game.
<EM99> :P
<EM99> BTW GH: ROFLCOPTER should come out.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Yeah, but the OFFICIAL name would be GH: World Tour.
<darkrath> 3why are you all debating about a name for a game? and you call me stupid...
<DragonFireOKN> 2There is no Guitar Hero 4.

<EM99> LAWL Strix asked me how she did in defending you.
<malefor> He changes to Skittles some times
<malefor> ......
<Aicebo> 13Barely.
<malefor> Dari comes on as his bots.....
<Aicebo> 13Besides, they are all at a higher level than you.
<Aicebo> 13He doesn't anymore.
<Aicebo> 13T___T
<Aicebo> 13You're just looking for an excuse.
<malefor> Whatever.......... Youjust like to pick on me......
<EM99> Yup.
<Aicebo> 13No, I'm telling you how to follow the rules.
<Aicebo> 13That's my job.
*malefor fires 98 shots!
<EM99> Ya mon.
<malefor> Well Spyrorocks doesn't care....
<Rurik> 4I changed my name Aicebo
<Rurik> 4From Rurikredwolf to Rurik
<malefor> Seee... Prooth!

*Rurik 4cancels it
<malefor> He doesn't care though.........
<Aicebo> 13He does.
<Aicebo> 13He's not here 24/7. It's called being idle.
<malefor> then why didn't he kick me? Hmmmm?
<malefor> *Then
<Aicebo> 13I leave my computer on days at a time.
<EM99> Because eh's idle.
<EM99> :P
<Aicebo> 13Because he wasn't there.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Aicebo> 13SR and I leave our computers on overnight on here.
<Aicebo> 13And we aren't always there.
<Rurik> 4I have a life, so I am never on
<malefor> He was here when I was as 'Bolt'
<Rurik> 4or I just don't speak
<Aicebo> 13He was on the chat, but he wasn't there.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<malefor> He even said: "Bolt?"
<malefor> He wondered.....
<Aicebo> 13No, he did not.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<EM99> LAWL

<Aicebo> 13(:
<malefor> No you weren't!
<EM99> He just disagreed that time...
<Aicebo> 13I know when and when I'm not somewhere
<Aicebo> 13He's bickering with me on purpose.
<EM99> So?
<EM99> He's not doing stuff anymore at least.
<Aicebo> 13One of the rules is not to piss of the mods.
<Aicebo> 13You didn't know that?
<EM99> Nope.
<Aicebo> 13And he's n00by
<Aicebo> 13:P

<EM99> :P
<Aicebo> 13Teachers just don't like it
<Aicebo> 13Typical gradeschool child.
<EM99> Mmm.
<Aicebo> 13Just like they don't want you starting with "because". You can. It's not against the law. What are they going to do, give away your drawing time? :P
<malefor_likes_pie> I say 'I don't get it' and my Math/Reading teacher says "You don't what?"
<malefor_likes_pie> She doesn't like that.
<EM99> No, what i emant was this.

<Deathbat> 10CEREAL!! :D
<Deathbat> 10GUITAR HERO!
<Deathbat> 10I owned someone called Mr Smokey Bacon and he quit in the middle of Before I Forget cos I was winning.
<Deathbat> 10and for some reason our thingy is called Kibble.

<Deathbat> 10yarp
<Deathbat> 10on GH 3.
<Deathbat> 10WOO!

<Deathbat> 10For some reason my idiotic sister named our thing Kibble. :(
<Kjakings> 7Or, just use the magic spoon
<Deathbat> 10arr ok lol
<Spyro_fan55> hey
<Aicebo> 13hi
<Spyro_fan55> hey Aicebo... can u join my RPG? I need a Spyro since Malefor quit
<Deathbat> 10good.
<Deathbat> 10Today was the first time I went on the wi-fi thing though
<Deathbat> 10lolz
<Deathbat> 10meh, i cba to play it now :P
<Deathbat> 10#spyrochat
<Deathbat> 10this is failing !!
<Deathbat> 10hey
<Yahoo> laaaaaaaaaaaggg
<Deathbat> 10fiiiineeeeeeeeeee
<Deathbat> 10hang on a minute
<Spyro_fan55> Aicebo?
<Aicebo> 13?
<Spyro_fan55> did u see wat i wrote?
<Aicebo> 13no....
<Aicebo> 13where.
<Spyro_fan55> up right after i entered the chat
<Kjakings> 7I refuse to join any RP where the maker insists on calling it an RPG.
<Spyro_fan55> ok?
<Kjakings> 7Just making sure for if you asked me...
<Aicebo> 13maybe
<Aicebo> 13Link me.
<Spyro_fan55> thats not realyl a reason since they are called RPG's
<Spyro_fan55> kk
<Kjakings> 7No, they're RPs. RPs are text or where someone has used a game not meant to be an RPG for RP. RPG's are GAMES.
<Kjakings> 7Notice the name. ROLE PLAYING _GAME_
<Spyro_fan55> well technically they are RPG's too
<Spyro_fan55> its a game of text
<Spyro_fan55> derrr
<Kjakings> 7An RP
<Spyro_fan55> A Role Play... that makes no sense reallt
<Spyro_fan55> @ Aicebo: http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-8090-spyro-rpg-a-prophecy-fulfilled-need-spyro.html
<Kjakings> 7Do you just ignore everything I say in the actual message and then say things over and over again until I either give up or agree, because if you do, then I refuse to continued this conversation.
<Spyro_fan55> yeah but your doing a certain quest in the RPG so its sorta like a game
<Kjakings> 7If you're doing some shit like a Runescape RP where you're doing it on a game, I pity you.
<Kjakings> 7ESPECIALLY if it's Runescape
<Spyro_fan55> NERDSCAPE IS GAY!
<Kjakings> 7A game with quests*
<Spyro_fan55> well Spyro has quests
<Spyro_fan55> a lot of games have quests
<Kjakings> 7No. Not 'quests' like in 'Nerdscape', as you colourfully called it, it has things you need to do in order to complete it. Not 'quests'.
<Spyro_fan55> true... true
<Kjakings> 7Yes, the one MAIN quest which is the STORYLINE
<Deathbat> 10ahh its workiiing
<Deathbat> 10yh
<Kjakings> 7Now then, go re-read my first message and argue with me on that, not just ignore what I said and say the same messages over and over again
<Deathbat> 10it is................
<Kjakings> 7And dari with your 'amazing' thought patterns that points out the obvious in a long and boring fashion.
<Deathbat> 10 141906815537
<Spyro_fan55> haha loll!
<Kjakings> 7No, you didn't. You were saying the same thing over and over again but just re-wording it
<Deathbat> 10Dari, I added yoooo :P
<Spyro_fan55> wait how long have u RP'd Kjakings?
<Kjakings> 7I dunno. Quite a while, but only RPed on forums for a few months
<Deathbat> 10ok :3
<Deathbat> 10w00ty
<Spyro_fan55> ok... ive been RPing for about a year... so they're called RPG's... thats wat they've always been called
<Deathbat> 10plaaaaaaaay!
<Kjakings> 7No. It's not. I've been RPing for more than a year on games.
<Deathbat> 10aww it aint coming up as ERIIIC :(
<Deathbat> 10just ERIII
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Spyro_fan55> well i have to
<Spyro_fan55> im a game fanatic
<Spyro_fan55> and RPG games are da besty
<Spyro_fan55> hey Stormy!
<Stormy> Hi =)
<Kjakings> 7They are /not/ RPG's unless they are games designed specifically for RP. Not forum RP's, not games were you have DECIDED to RP. THEY ARE _R_P_S_
<Stormy> ...What?
<Stormy> :P
<Yahoo> Lol
<Spyro_fan55> but you have to go on a "quest" (whatever) to reach a certain goal in Forum RPG's just like in Game RPG's
<Stormy> Oh, guys, guess what?
<Stormy> We got a Wii
<Spyro_fan55> you ROLE PLAY a certain character like in a GAME
<Stormy> XD
<Kjakings> 7Only if you're doing shitty RP's on stuff like Runescape. In games liek Spyro RPs the one 'quest' in the STORYLINE. THEREFOR, IT IS NOT AN RPG
<Kjakings> 7is*
<Spyro_fan55> well yeah... you are only doing one 'quest" in the storyline in forum RPG's but you have to go through a series of events in order to finish the one quest just like in a GAME
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but... my god. I have NEVER met someone so idiotic. Seriously, you're just repeating the same thing OVER AND OVER AND OVER while completely disregarding my arguments. You are not worth my time to argue with.
<Spyro_fan55> good for me...
<Spyro_fan55> idk
<Yahoo> http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=KMcYrbM-QEY OUCH
*Kjakings 7marvels at the sheer stupidity of SF55
<Kjakings> 7Right, Stormy
<Kjakings> 7Was that Icy ban supposed to be perma?
<Spyro_fan55> haha gracias... i take stupid retard etc as COMPLEMMENTS!
<Stormy> No, just a short ban
<Kjakings> 7MMkay
<Kjakings> 7Just checking
<Stormy> I was going to unban him in a couple days.
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo de-banned earlier today
<Stormy> Oh
<Stormy> Yeah, she would.
<Stormy> She likes Icy.
<Stormy> =P
<Aicebo> 13No I don't.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Stormy> Lol
<Aicebo> 13I like Edina
<Aicebo> 13(:
<Stormy> Well, you think he's funny
<Stormy> That's what I meant :P
<Aicebo> 13Yeah, lots of people are funny, that doesn't mean I "like" them like taht
<Aicebo> 13*that
<Stormy> I just said "like," not /like/ like. :P
<Fina_Fox> hey guys
<Stormy> If you /liked/ Icy, I'd be scared.
<Stormy> Hi Fina_Fox
<Deathbat> 10arrrghhhhhhhh gtg
<Deathbat> 10byeee
<Kjakings> 7Stormy: If she /like/ like likeity like liked Icy, I'd be wondering why you used so many likes in one sentance. And have to burn her
<Stormy> Oh, now you're just exaggerating. :P
<Stormy> I only said it three times.
<Stormy> XD
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, but I felt the point had to be made :P
<Stormy> Same
<Stormy> That's why I emphasized it the way I did.
<Kjakings> 7Lol
*Kjakings 7wonders how long until the internet goes out again
<Kjakings> 7o_O
<Aicebo> 13..........................
<Stormy> What
<Kjakings> 7Cheese.
<Kjakings> 7Magic laz0rz?
<Kjakings> 7Lol
<Stormy> ...
<Aicebo> 13..........
<Kjakings> 7I'm having an argubate (half way between argument and debate) with a mod on DCF, this is always fun~
<Aicebo> 13And so SR set out in search of the magic laz0rz.
<Kjakings> 7Because (90% of the time) mods are always demanding and self-richess, generally employing the "if you don't agree with me I'll ban you" tactic
<Kjakings> 7~~~Duct tape is like the force. It has a light side and a dark side and it holds the universe together.~~~ Can anyone say n00b?
<Stormy> No.
<Stormy> :P
<Kjakings> 7Bugger it. Every time I sneeze now I end up kneeing the table. Eventually I'll either break the table or my knee. :P
<Yahoo> KJ, that happens to me as well. Mainly hiccups
<Yahoo> Haha
<Aicebo> 13LOL
<Aicebo> 13It's probably Malefor :P
<Stormy> Malefor isn't the only religious person in the world. :P
<Aicebo> 13he loves Jesus and he is an epic phail
<Aicebo> 13:P

<lilgti> oh crap i clicked it again!!
<Yahoo> HA
<lilgti> ahhhhhhh
<lilgti> !
<Kjakings> 7No, you didn't.
*DragonFireOKN 2gets a Wich Astwey dwaggy and sicks it on Kjakings.
<Yahoo> ITS THE WORST ONE
<lilgti> yes i did
<Kjakings> 7Because if you did you wouldn't be able to type, you fucking moron
<Kjakings> 7If you wanna do an Ayumi, then go make RD12 and Yahoo's little liasons a 3-some. Rather than pining for attention like the stupid mother-fucker you are.
<Yahoo> Oy, what did I do?!
<Kjakings> 7RR'd me.
<lilgti> yes i did click it
<Yahoo> I SAID SORRY SHEESH
<Kjakings> 7If you EVER manage to RR me then get over it, rather than say it at every opportunity
<lilgti> and i can still type?
<Kjakings> 7Lilgti: No, you didn't. Now fuck off.
<lilgti> yes i did retard
<Kjakings> 7No. You didn't.

<Kjakings> 7pingspam*
<lilgti> what?
<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> Sorry about that
<Kjakings> 7No, because you said 'I clicked it again' as if you had JUST clicked it. With liner you have to completely close down firefox. Not even ayumi's little pinings were this transparent and obvious. And I seriously doubt even /you/ have the stupidity to click a link when we'red talking about RRing people and you were just RR'd yourself.
<Kjakings> 7So grow the fuck up dickwad.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: I said with liner. You idiot.

<DragonFireOKN> I don't think I've ever gotten a fever over 100.0 F
<EM99> ^ LOL

<EM99> I took the Chuck Norris vaccine.
<EM99> You get the picture.
*DragonFireOKN gives Dari Dwaggy-pox
<lilgti> ha LOL
<DragonFireOKN> 2lol
<Kjakings> 7 20:24	prince-dari	I've not been ill for...Ever. I'm never ill. Most germs die on contact with me, and the few who get through hit fast and hard, except this one is kinda mild for other times I've been ill. The last time \I had to take time off school for being ill was when I had shingles.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Shingles?
<lilgti> yeah ceramic ones
<EM99> XD
*DragonFireOKN 2infects Dari with the NSV
<EM99> "The herpes virus that causes shingles and chickenpox is not the same as the herpes virus that causes genital herpes"
<EM99> So that's why KJ got it.
<lilgti> i have all the NFS's
<EM99> NFS's?
<DragonFireOKN> 2NSV=Naggy Stormy Virus

<lilgti> *runs
<EM99> Lawl.
<Kjakings> 7 20:29	EM99	"The herpes virus that causes shingles and chickenpox is not the same as the herpes virus that causes genital herpes" Shingles is chickenpox re-awakened. Sometimes it can latch onto nerves (like it did with me) and numb that portion of the body. It did that to the left side of my head and I had to take bloody eyedrops.
<EM99> Your immune system is illegal.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Its 3:30 here
<EM99> KJA: I know what it is. :P
<EM99> I was JKing.
<DragonFireOKN> 2What state do you guys live in?

<DragonFireOKN> 2However, if it weren't for the USA, Europe would be under Nazi control.
*Kjakings 7would prefer to go on a shotgun massacre in the USA
<DragonFireOKN> 2France got its ass kicked in WW2
<lilgti> yeah thats right
<EM99> OK, denial much?
<DragonFireOKN> 2The British Empire was losing badly.
<lilgti> are you a jew??
<Kjakings> 7DFOKN: And without England, The united States of America wouldn't exist.
<EM99> LOL
<DragonFireOKN> 2True
<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> TRUE SO TRUE

<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> You guys just slugged there
<EM99> There were several others.
<EM99> Erik the Red for one.
<EM99> And where do you think the "Indians" cvame from. They migrated from Asia.
<EM99> *came from?
<DragonFireOKN> 2The vikings were at North America hundreds of years before the Europeans
<DragonFireOKN> 2And so were the Indians
<lilgti> indians are asains
<lilgti> ?
<EM99> Yes.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I like the UK.

<DragonFireOKN> 2However, France sucks ass
<Kjakings> 7UK KICKZ YUR ARZE
<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> Well we dont have the lesson "American History" at my school so I dont know

<Kjakings> 7YA RLY
<DragonFireOKN> 2No one would win
<DragonFireOKN> 2Nukes would kill everyone
<EM99> Mars is laughing..
<DragonFireOKN> 2Although, the U.S, has WAY more nukes than anyone
<EM99> "Haha!"
<DragonFireOKN> 2But we would be stupid enough not to use them
<DragonFireOKN> 2Obama: "Doy, lets use diplomacy
<Kjakings> 7People are bitching about Global Warming, and Nuclear Winter Happening. Why don't we just let both happen, and take down the weakened victor ('Atomic Sping' or 'Flaming Autumn?).
<EM99> "US has way more nukes than anybody else, 2100, whatever." -End Of e World

<Kjakings> 7Does anyone listen to my posts anymore?
<EM99> *zombies
<DragonFireOKN> 2Then blame France
<EM99> ^ Yup.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Dari: Or you could wait for Yellowstone national park to blow up
<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> UK nuke USA, Asia get the blame, boom boom Asia. Sorted.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Yellowstone is a Supervolcano
<Kjakings> 7XOMBIES. NOUN. The 'Xombie' is a combination of 'Zombie' and 'Xerox'. The 'Xombie' is a special form of zombie that can self replicate to create unending hordes. However, the 'Xombie' virus is not airborne, and they drown the second they touch water deeper than their head, so the UK, Ireland, USA and all other islands are safe from the 'Middle Eastern Xombies'.
<EM99> Kjakings Does anyone listen to my posts anymore? No, we are deliberately ignoring you. :/
*DragonFireOKN 2would laugh if SR ran up to hug Stormy and Dari nuked her.
<Yahoo_the_storm_dragon> Lol
<Kjakings> 7Tsch. FINE! YOU GET EATEN BY XOMBIES! I WON'T TELL YOU HOW TO KILL THEM! *rants*
<EM99> But you missed one very important aspect. I AM a Middle Eastern Xombie.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Guard: Mr. Obama, please don't click that button. It controls when the nukes will blow up." Obama: "You mean this button?" *pushes it.*
<DragonFireOKN> 2*End of the world*

<EM99> Holy crap.
<EM99> Every part of his body is a registered WMD!

<EM99> I see.
<Kjakings> 7And then they killed him

<EM99> Impossible.
<Kjakings> 7Because, evil or not, Chuck Norris takes shit from nobody.

<Sparx96> Hello
<Aicebo> 13hi.
<Sparx96> Aicebo?!
<Aicebo> 13What.
<Sparx96> Nothing
<Aicebo> 13:/
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo Pastebin. :P
<Aicebo> 13Oh shaddup Kja :P
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Sparx96> Its cool that you are here Aicebo.
<Aicebo> 13O___o
<Aicebo> 13I'm always here. :P
<Kjakings> 7No you're not
<Sparx96> XD
<Aicebo> 13I'm always logged in, at least.
<Aicebo> 13Almost always
<Kjakings> 7You weren't here 2 days, 16 hours and 1 minute ago.
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Sparx96> ok
<Aicebo> 13Kja: I always exit in and out of here, especially if mibbit isn't cooperating :P
<Sparx96> O___0
<Kjakings> 7I remember lapses when you weren't logged on for quite a while. I just can't remember when.
<Aicebo> 13dari: Yes, but I don't have mIRC
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Kjakings> 7It's like 'big-brother' SR who claims he's always here but is rarely ACTUALLY here.
<Aicebo> 13Yeah I DO turn off the computer when I'm out of the house and no one's home lol.
<Kjakings> 7Yeah. Because he's that much of a loser
<Kjakings> 7Wait..
<Kjakings> 7You're right!
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Kjakings> 7Dari, I just agreed
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Aicebo> He read all about what we said about pr0n!
<Sparx96> Linkin Park RULES!
<Kjakings> 7 19:29	Kjakings	Yeah. Because he's that much of a loser 19:29	Kjakings	Wait.. 19:29	Kjakings	You're right!
<Aicebo> 13Linkin Park sucks
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Kjakings> 7 19:29	Sparx96	Linkin Park RULES! Linking Sporks
<Sparx96> My Chemical Romance Sucks!
<Aicebo> 13I really don't know why everyone thinks they're so great. I mean Spyroforum ruined the one song I liked from them now I regret downloading anything from Linkin Logs.
<Aicebo> 13Sparx96: Good for you chap :P
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Aicebo> 13No, it's just I don't believe they deserve the bunch that they get.
<Aicebo> 13And yes, it is
<Sparx96> Linkin Park way beats My Chemical Romance.
<Aicebo> 13They're one of the ONLY bands I don't like because of being overrated.
<Kjakings> 7Because whenever anyone else likes something, it becomes over-rated an Aicebo hates it~
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Aicebo> 13No, that's not true.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but it's one of our few running gags
<Sparx96> Bullcrap
<Aicebo> 13Just because I like about 2 things because they're overrated doesn't mean I hate every overrated thing. I like lots of overrated things.
<Kjakings> 7Yes, but it's one of our few running gags
<Spyrorocks> Whats going on?
<Sparx96> Metallica Rukes
<Kjakings> 7Sparx is ranting about music
<Kjakings> 7We're annoying the mod
<Kjakings> 7And everyone else is AFK
<Aicebo> 13=P
<Sparx96> So
<Spyrorocks> "Stop scaring away new members."
<Sparx96> nop
<Kjakings> 7He is
<Sparx96> so
<Kjakings> 7How is that scaring away?
<Kjakings> 7We haven't commented
<Spyrorocks> Just watch it.
<Kjakings> 7Just discussing with the mod
<Spyrorocks> Just watch it.
<Sparx96> Nickelback Rules.
<Aicebo> 13Kja is trying to piss me off at the same time :P
<Kjakings> 7What did I do?!
<Aicebo> 13Sparx96: Nah. :P
<Kjakings> 7You asked what was happening, I told you
<Sparx96> Yeah
<Kjakings> 7How the hell does that constitute me scaring away the new members?
<Aicebo> 13Yeah that's unfair
<Rurik> 4O_o
<Sparx96> Shes Being a Butthole
<Spyrorocks> Just watch it.
<Kjakings> 7Sparx, I'm a GUY
<Spyrorocks> Tread lightly.
<Kjakings> 7WTF did I do?
<Spyrorocks> I thought you were a chick too.
<Aicebo> 13Sparx96 is the one being rude here.
<Sparx96> I was talking about Aicebo
<Kjakings> 7Oh
<Kjakings> 7Fair enough
<Spyrorocks> I know your nature, Kjakings, and it includes trying to scare away new members. Im just saying, tread lightly and watch what you say.
<Sparx96> ok
<Aicebo> 13How am I being an ass for sharing some opinions.
<Aicebo> 13What are you 9.
<Sparx96> no im 12
<Aicebo> 13Could've fooled me :P
<Rurik> 4I feel like I stepped into a warzone.....O_o
<Sparx96> i dont belive in cusing
<Spyrorocks> Aicebo: Don't you hate it when people judge you by your age?
<Rurik> 4I do
<Sparx96> yes
<Sparx96> im noy\t saying that
<Spyrorocks> And I don't care if you don't like what I said.
<Kjakings> 7SR's randomly pissy with me because he asked what was going on when we used the 'over-rated' running gag and I told him, and he just randomly says "watch it"
<Aicebo> 13Yes, but Jesus Christ this person is calling me a "butthole" for having a different opinion than him on something. -___-
<Sparx96> ok could you stop cusing
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo, maybe he's malefor.
<Spyrorocks> Sparx96: Watch what you type as well.
<Spyrorocks> No, I already matched IPs.
<Sparx96> im a girl
<Aicebo> 13Sparx96: I dunno, can we?
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Sparx96> sure no cusing please
<Aicebo> 13Nahh.
<Spyrorocks> I'm randomly pissy because its rare we get new regulars here at spyrochat so I would like to see if we can get a few more.
<Kjakings> 7And I did NOTHING except answer your question!
<Rurik> 4Then I may as well just quit. I have a baaaaad tendancy to swear
<Spyrorocks> Im not directing everything at you personally.
<Spyrorocks> I know your nature, Kjakings, and it includes trying to scare away new members. Im just saying, tread lightly and watch what you say.
<Yahoo> Back
<Aicebo> 13Hey Yahoo.
<Kjakings> 7I actually stopped doing that quite a while ago. Now I'm just hating them for all their n00bish tendancies.
<Kjakings> 7Go moan at Neon.
<Aicebo> 13I just wish that the new members had some sense :/
<Kjakings> 7It's not 'new members', it's just 'new members who happen to be n00bs'
<Spyrorocks> Well guess what? When you have a forum and chatroom targeted at a younger audience, it could just very well be their first forum they have ever been on, so you must be tolerant of so called "noobish" tenancies.
<Aicebo> 13Lots of them happen to be n00bs.
<Aicebo> 13I'm not going to agree with them on everything if I don't agree with what they say. If it "scares them off" then they can go learn about opinions.
<Spyrorocks> A lot of them are younger, for their first few days you need to say things in a way that wont scare them away. After they get used to it, you can loosen up a bit.
<Kjakings> 7SR: I have. The problem is, when we try and correct them and STOP them from being n00by, so we can actually LIKE them so they have more friends, you tell us we're scaring them off.
<Kjakings> 7It's a stupid stupid cycle
<Spyrorocks> Kjakings: When were you trying to help sparx?
<Kjakings> 7SR: He wasn't being n00by much. He was calling Aicebo names and she had it under control, so I felt no need to acknowledge him.
<Spyrorocks> Correcting spelling is defiantly annoying and benefits no one, the user usually doesn't care.
<Spyrorocks> OK good, I was just saying, watch what you say because you DO have a tendency to scare people away.
<Kjakings> 7Dari: I stopped doing ANYTHING to n00bs because almost everything is under the category of scaring them off. I only correct Neon and Yahoo etc.
<Rurik> 4and me
<Kjakings> 7And you
<Yahoo> ....
<Rurik> 4:P
<Kjakings> 7But we're friends, sort of, so it's completely different.
<Yahoo> and SR once or twice
<Kjakings> 7Only when he's asked for spelling
<Aicebo> Ask Kja about the Club Penguin forum XDDDDD
<Aicebo> OK. Lol.
<Kjakings> 7Most people are mature enough to acknowledge they spelt it wrong, and while it is annoying, which is why I stopped doing it randomly except to my friends and people I dislike, and correct the spelling, and move on.
<Kjakings> 7If you have someone who gets stressy when they're told they spelt something wrong, then EVERYTHING is 'scaring them away'
<Rurik> 4I know I can't spell some words :P
<Spyrorocks> Thats not the point
<Kjakings> 7It's A point.
<Spyrorocks> Its provoking.
<Spyrorocks> Dont try to be a smart ass with everything I say.
<Kjakings> 7What the hell is your problem? You come on, ask me what's going on, I tell you, and suddenly you tell me I'm scaring away someone I'm not even talking to!
<Spyrorocks> I never said you were scaring members away, I said to tread lightly because you have a tendency to scare members away.
<Spyrorocks> I have said that multiple times now.
<Kjakings> 7Which I stopped. Quite a while ago. Which I have said multiple times now.
<Spyrorocks> Just watch what you say to new members, and don't argue with my wishes.
<Kjakings> 7You sound like some kind of supervillian from a crappy fan movie. "Do not argue with my wishes, Mr. Bond."
<Aicebo> 13haha
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> Theres no point in arguing with me about what I want for my forum or chat room.
<Kjakings> 7When did this turn into arguing with you for what you want for your forum and your chatroom? This started as me protesting I had done nothing wrong, because I stopped 'scaring away' new members a while ago, by just not acknowledging them since apprently even having a different opinion or point of view and arguing your case is 'scaring them away'
<Kjakings> 7Bugger... hold on a minute
<Spyrorocks> I don't have a case
<Spyrorocks> I just said don't scare away new members.
<Spyrorocks> You insist on dragging things along.
<Spyrorocks> Either you stop now, or I kick/ban, because it really doesn't bother me.
<Kjakings> 7Ok back. I hate being sick.
<Kjakings> 7Actually, I tried to end the argument with that super-villian statement, then you pulled out this BS about arguing what you want for your forum or chatroom
<Spyrorocks> I had the 24 hour flu a week or two.
<Kjakings> 7That sucks
<Spyrorocks> the super-villain statement was not attempting to end anything, if anything it was more provoking.
<Kjakings> 7... Right. If you say so.
<Spyrorocks> Either you stop now, or I kick/ban, because it really doesn't bother me.
<Kjakings> 7Whatever.
<Rurik> 4dun dun dun :O
<Yahoo> omg this place is deeeeeeeeeeeeead

<gerpie> takes damn long to find a working 1
<gerpie> so what 1 are u trying to hack now?
<gerpie> XD
<Spyrorocks> anybody want NDS Lite Flashcards?
<gerpie> huh?
<gerpie> still 5 minz to go ti install a fking private T_T
<Spyrorocks> $15 for TT NDS Lite Flashcard, if you want.
<Spyrorocks> play all the games you want for free
<gerpie> nope
<gerpie> f course not ;p
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, if you own the game you are allowed to play backups of it.
<gerpie> and sr?
<Spyrorocks> But if you don't own the games you are loading onto it then its illegal because you don't own the game.
<gerpie> kja sayd something like that y like stormy ;\
<Spyrorocks> If you own the game but lost it or something, its legal to play a backup of it.
<Spyrorocks> But I don't care, put me in jail.
<Spyrorocks> No one has gone to jail or has gotten fined for downloading and playing NDS games.
<Spyrorocks> Nintendo doesn't sue its customers.
<Spyrorocks> If they do, im screwed as well.
<Spyrorocks> If you have PayPal, ill ship you this card for $15, and ill preload it with like 20 games, its up to you to delete the ones you don't own ;)
<gerpie> im bored T_T
<gerpie> and sr?
<Spyrorocks> theres a microsd card on the nds lite?
<Spyrorocks> slot*
<Spyrorocks> Oh
<gerpie> sr?
<Spyrorocks> I just bought 2 NDS lites a few days ago and none of them had minisd slots
<Yahoo> STOP TEMPTING ME
<Spyrorocks> so I was wondering if i was blind
<Yahoo> I WANT IT NOA
<Spyrorocks> why would it have 2 cameras?
<gerpie> SR?? -.-
<Spyrorocks> Just because it has a microsd slot doesnt mean its possible to load games onto it, it could just be for saves
<Spyrorocks> gerpie: what?

<Yahoo> lol
<Blaze> 4Hi guys
<Spyrorocks> Yeah in like grade 6 I coded an app to spam my friend's guestbook on piczo
<Spyrorocks> I loled at her
<darkrath> 3lol
<gerpie> well guys i g2g off
<gerpie> cya later
<Aicebo> 13Finally he's gone. -__-
<Aicebo> 13He made up a bunch of shit.
<Blaze> 4uhh hi guys
<Blaze> 4HELLO!!!!????!!!!??
<Spyrorocks> what type of a checksum is it?
<Spyrorocks> CRC?
<Blaze> 4hi icy!
<Spyrorocks> JUst create a new checksum and replace it
<Spyrorocks> If you know the method used to create it you can create a checksum for your new data and stick it in there
<Spyrorocks> If you know the method used to create the checksum you can checksum your new data
<Spyrorocks> If its in the SWF then its going to be difficult.
<Spyrorocks> Because you will need to either convert the code used to create the checksum into a different language or make a new flash applet and copy the checksum function.
<Blaze> 4can i be noticed now?
<Spyrorocks> asm wont help you.
<Blaze> 4soo what are we talking about
<Spyrorocks> If you can get the routine used to create the checksum, you can copy it and checksum your own data and replace their checksum with your own.
<Spyrorocks> ASM wont help you.
<Spyrorocks> It doesn't explain why asm would help you
<Spyrorocks> where does it mention assembly?
<Blaze> 4uuhhhh what are we doing
<Blaze> 4what assembly?
<Spyrorocks> ASM wont help you
<Spyrorocks> Just use a memory editor to see the values
<Spyrorocks> But that will be very hard
<Spyrorocks> cheatengine
<Blaze> 4I FEEL F***** INVISIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Spyrorocks> Its not worth the time
<Spyrorocks> Im just trying to remember stuff from when I was a nub who thought he was cool for memory editing flash games like 4 years ago
<Spyrorocks> I wouldnt bother with editing the save game file
<Spyrorocks> Just memory edit the game while its running and change score values
<Spyrorocks> then it will create a sol for you already checksumed.
<Spyrorocks> legit
<Spyrorocks> I am good friends with one of the moderators from the cheat engine forums
<darkrath> 3Are you two done yet??????????????
<Spyrorocks> haven't talked to him in a few months though
<Spyrorocks> I know a lot of people.
<Spyrorocks> Yep
*Blaze 4IS MAD
*Blaze 4is REALLY mad
<darkrath> 3Can we talk about snowboarding Please?
*Spyrorocks wonders why blaze is mad
<Aicebo> 13No.
<Aicebo> 13:P
*darkrath 3throws his snowboard at aicebo
*Blaze 4answers that its because im being ignored
<Spyrorocks> I know a lot of things about pretty much everything
*Aicebo 13gets the boot :P
<Spyrorocks> Mostly from people I have talked to over the years

*darkrath 3does the jig
<Blaze> srry
<darkrath> 3Hi blaze
<Blaze> 4ill stop
*darkrath 3tells blaze to do the jig with him
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: I dont think the swf makes the checksum, its probably a feature built into flash.
<Blaze> 4spyrorocks? that messege you left me was lol
<Blaze> 4when you kicked me
<Spyrorocks> I personally wouldn't bother with it
<Spyrorocks> I dont think so, I think flash checksums all its saved data files
<Spyrorocks> But then again, I have never bothered with flash saved game editing.
*darkrath 3laughs at blaze being ignored again
<Blaze> 4spyrorocks? that messege was relly funny
<Spyrorocks> thanks :)
<Blaze> 4orange
<darkrath> 3what was the message?
<Spyrorocks> Why not do something productive?
<Spyrorocks> I dunno, find something to do that you can make money off of or something
<Blaze> 4the messege was orange
<darkrath> 3like selling lemonade
<Blaze> 4does anyone here know how to look at a magic eye?
<darkrath> 3Or selling game accounts for 100$ each
<darkrath> 3cool i just got you money...
<Spyrorocks> If your selling game accounts you need to setup payment processing.
<Spyrorocks> I am a master with that as well.
<darkrath> 3what game are you talking about?
<Spyrorocks> Nope, I am the best at everything.
<darkrath> 3SR, are you good at shooping?
<Spyrorocks> Usually, people don't buy accounts, they just buy the virtual items.
<darkrath> 3Do you guys play dragonfable?
<Yahoo> Ew no
<Blaze> 4i play adventurequest im a gardian
<Blaze> 4and level 54

<Spyrorocks> You will be banned if the find you selling virtual stuff.
<Spyrorocks> From the game
<darkrath> 3your a comp nerd...
<Spyrorocks> most online games dont like resellers
<Spyrorocks> Unless they allow you to sell items for real money.
<Aicebo> 13darkrath: How am I a computer nerd? I don't do math and play World of Warcraft all day.

<XRedDragonX> I don't care what he does lol
<Dillan> SF on spyrochat?
<XRedDragonX> as far as I know unless he is lying about his age..which I'm sure he is lol...a 14 year old doesn't make that much or know that stuff without proper schooling
<XRedDragonX> no difference lol
<XRedDragonX> unless he does happen to be a super genious
<XRedDragonX> which is possible
<XRedDragonX> genius
<XRedDragonX> damn it
<XRedDragonX> you can learn anything from the internet lol
<XRedDragonX> making websites isn't hard
<XRedDragonX> well
<XRedDragonX> if you can make a career in computers you should do it. It's pretty good money
<XRedDragonX> just a lot of hard work
<XRedDragonX> and schooling
<Dillan> who likes sonic?
<XRedDragonX> there is a lot more to it then you think..depending on what you want to do in computers in general
<XRedDragonX> well again it depends on what you want to do
<XRedDragonX> I have been to school with guys who try to do this stuff
<XRedDragonX> I don't know how they do it
<XRedDragonX> too much math for me
<XRedDragonX> what are you in college
<XRedDragonX> well unless you're in college or it's a really fancy school I don't know how much it counts for lol
<XRedDragonX> I don't know about all this stuff nor do I want to lol
<XRedDragonX> I do what I do in life...but as far as I hear it's hard shit when it gets really advanced
<XRedDragonX> lol
<Dillan> i gotta go. i hope to speak to XRedDragonX when i have the new spyro game .
<XRedDragonX> cya man
<XRedDragonX> well again I don't pretend to know about this computer stuff. I know what I need to get by..and I set up all the electronic stuff in the house lol...but I'm just a normal working guy
<XRedDragonX> and realism does take a very big take in my mind
<XRedDragonX> srry I'm tired I'll word things strangly lol
<XRedDragonX> Realism has a very big presence in my mind
<XRedDragonX> that better?
<XRedDragonX> lol
<XRedDragonX> but I tried school
<XRedDragonX> It's not for me
<XRedDragonX> well it is but not like some other people
<XRedDragonX> Oh I'm smart don't get me wrong lol....but I don't see the necessity in my life to pursue something that I don't need
<XRedDragonX> I feel better getting up and going to my job every day...it makes me feel better to be a good old fashion working guy like things use to be
<XRedDragonX> and it makes me feel more relevent to society
<XRedDragonX> that and believe it or not you can make just as much money without a degree these days then you can with one
<XRedDragonX> people who are my friends dont' judge me because I chose not to pursue further education..they judge me for who I am and what I want in life
<XRedDragonX> Oh not getting an education is great don't get me wrong
<XRedDragonX> "no"
<XRedDragonX> I encourage anyone to do it
<XRedDragonX> but many people these days judge you for not getting a degree as "useless to society"
<XRedDragonX> and many of them now live in la la land and have no realism left in them
<XRedDragonX> personally many of the people I know who don't have degrees are much better people then most of those who do
<XRedDragonX> if you have a desire to do something in life then go for it
<XRedDragonX> that's not what I'm trying to discourage
<XRedDragonX> things are getting harder and harder..and paying for an education is one of them
<XRedDragonX> 30 years ago when society needed all these jobs
<XRedDragonX> yeah college was def worth it then
<XRedDragonX> nowadays about 50% of all the students who come out can't get a job
<XRedDragonX> well that was wierd
<XRedDragonX> anyways human beings are born with the ability to learn...one of the parts of our humanity is to continue to evolve and continue to better ourselves
<XRedDragonX> but many...and I stress MANY...have no desire anymore
<XRedDragonX> our society has become so lazy it isn't even funny
<XRedDragonX> sometimes I wish that things were still like they were 100 years ago without most of the stuff that has influenced us today
<XRedDragonX> Like I said man..I'm not telling you to not go get a degree...because yes it will help you in life no matter where you go..this is my personal view and my personal choice. I do encourage everyone to go get an education because it will benefit you...but the problem is..many of today's generation just waste the money and find no way to use it to their advantage
<XRedDragonX> but that's just the choice I have made. I have a great job that pays just as much as one with a degree would..and I love doint it
<XRedDragonX> "doing it"
<XRedDragonX> I'm happy with it...and i still continue to better myself thorugh experiences
<XRedDragonX> I work for Coca-Cola
<XRedDragonX> and I'm in the United States Navy
<XRedDragonX> and I'm a snowboard instructor
<XRedDragonX> yeah I get around lol
<XRedDragonX> but I love doing all of them
<XRedDragonX> and I'm not ruling out the ability or the desire to get a degree
<XRedDragonX> I still want one believe me
<XRedDragonX> I will just get it differently then others
<XRedDragonX> and I don't rush to judge someone just because they chose to work instead of go to school
<XRedDragonX> lol
<XRedDragonX> it's all good man
<XRedDragonX> we're humans we are meant to converse each other's ideas
<XRedDragonX> or challenge whatever lol
<XRedDragonX> and I respect anyone who has a degree
<XRedDragonX> most of my friends are in school now
<XRedDragonX> and I support them
<XRedDragonX> I will support me kids in it
<XRedDragonX> it's just a personel choice I made
<XRedDragonX> and overall it has made me a better person
<XRedDragonX> and yes you are correct in saying that life could and would be easier for me if I had a degree
<XRedDragonX> I know it would..that's one of the wonderful things about having it
<XRedDragonX> but it is my choice to get up and work hard every day
<XRedDragonX> it drives me to be a good human being and a hard worker
<XRedDragonX> and it has made me understand just how hard life can be for some people
<XRedDragonX> always will be
<XRedDragonX> ying and yang are always in effect...son long as the world continues to rotate
<XRedDragonX> "so"
<XRedDragonX> damn I'm getting tired lol
<XRedDragonX> 11
<XRedDragonX> but I worked 14 hours today
<XRedDragonX> and I have to work again tomorrow
<XRedDragonX> yeah long day
<XRedDragonX> and I wanted to punch the idiot I had to deal with
<XRedDragonX> My large days I work for Coke
<XRedDragonX> weekends I'm at the mountain usually
<XRedDragonX> I love teaching others how to board
<XRedDragonX> today was the exception
<XRedDragonX> yeah
<XRedDragonX> I try to keep out of the house
<XRedDragonX> sup man

<XRedDragonX> but yeah man if you have a desire to do something then go for it

<Kjakings> 7I corrected myself. 18:34	Kjakings	No wait... it's $2.50, not $10 meaning that a dollar is worth 50p
<Deathbat> 10Just use an online currency converter 
<SuperM> Aicebo: It's a game we were playing while you were asleep, and did I tell you that Kjakings sade that he would kill Icy?

<Aicebo> 13Yahoo....do we HAVE to hear about it? D:
<Yahoo> Ya
<Yahoo> I hate being isolated
<Aicebo> 13Dun dun DUUUUUN
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: She keeps telling us, even though I've siad many times no-one gives a fuck
<Spyrorocks> Hows Ayumi? :P
<Yahoo> Well I talk to myself other wise
<Yahoo> Out loud
<Aicebo> 13Guys, want me to type what Ayumi's video said...?
<Yahoo> SR: How would I know? I haven't spoken to him that much
<Rurik> 4He stopped spaming my page
<Spyrorocks> Yahoo: Im not directing that comment at anyone in particular, just a general question for anyone to answer
<Rurik> 4I don't feel like flaming him, as it would get me no where
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo: Except for telling him EVERYTHING I try and do to him
<Rurik> 4except bored
<Aicebo> 13SR: I can type out what his video says since it's private....
<Spyrorocks> why dont you download the video and reupload somewhere
<Kjakings> 7SHUT THE DEAD AND OUT OF MY LIFE! :P I love that saying
<Kjakings> 7Ooh yay I have sound now
<Aicebo> 13nah
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Yahoo> 20:28 Kjakings Yahoo: Except for telling him EVERYTHING I try and do to him I didn't tell him anything
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: Nope. You won't make much, people who play games don't want to click ads, they just wana play games.
<Spyrorocks> You won't make anything for CPM.
<Spyrorocks> PPC you will make much more than CPM, but gamers are not a very good group to market to.
<Rurik> 4Computer talk...making...brain....explode....
<Rurik> 4wtf
<Rurik> 4I clicked another tab and it gave me a blank screen
<Spyrorocks> Games are extremely hard to monetize unless you have a system in place for monetizing the game, forcing people to preform actions to make you money in order to proceed in the game.
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: Link me to where it says that and ill take a read through it.
<Aicebo> 13http://mibbit.com/pb/9LAE11 Ayumi's words in his video. Kinda sounds like a bunch of baloney with the freedom part, though...:/
<Spyrorocks> freedom?
<Aicebo> 13and the corruption feeds thing
<Aicebo> 13Hahaha
<Rurik> 4ok'
<Rurik> 4wtf
<Rurik> 4sounds like some virus movie
<Spyrorocks> loading
<Kjakings> 7Corruption feeds hatred, which leads to the dark side with a few more links between which I have forgotten
<Kjakings> 7Blame Yoda
<Aicebo> 13LOL.
<Rurik> 4according to Yoda, picking your nose is a path to the dark side
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: I am not seeing where it actually breaks down how you earn the money, like CPM PPC or what...
<Spyrorocks> Theres one thing though that you really must know: Gamers don't click ads.
<Spyrorocks> Money is made by users clicking your ads. You won't make anything with CPM ads.
<Spyrorocks> Ummm
<Spyrorocks> do you get paid per impression or paid per click.
<Spyrorocks> CPM = Impression
<Spyrorocks> PPC = Per lcikc
<Spyrorocks> click*
<Spyrorocks> I wouldn't partnership with any site that doesn't explain how you will be getting money for submitting your content.
<Spyrorocks> I wouldn't do it, not much money in home developed games.
<Spyrorocks> Trust me, I know a little bit about marketing.
<Spyrorocks> Site doesnt explain stuff very well, I would look away
<Rurik> 4That just lost me
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> I remember years ago when I used to make games with GameMaker 6
<Rurik> 4It is for me. I tarded, remember?
<Spyrorocks> I memorized the game maker scripting language as well
<Rurik> 4O_o
<Spyrorocks> only thing that sucked was the compile size of 1mb+
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, but with flash you dont have access to the filesystem of a PC, and some other stuff like OpenGL.
<Spyrorocks> You can't execute, write, or read files on the PC.
<Spyrorocks> I doubt it, it would be a security risk.
<Spyrorocks> Yeag but that requires user interaction
<Spyrorocks> You can't just read a file and transmit it automatically
<Spyrorocks> Like you can with a desktop app.
<Aicebo> 13brb
<Spyrorocks> java is full of security holes
<Spyrorocks> you can download and execute any executable you want from within the browser with no user interaction.
<Spyrorocks> Uninstall java.
<Spyrorocks> I doubt that will work
<Spyrorocks> Flash is pretty secure now, just a few bugs here and there
<Spyrorocks> yes
<Spyrorocks> test it
<Spyrorocks> make a computer run notepad.exe
<Spyrorocks> when they run the flash applet
<Spyrorocks> from a website
<Spyrorocks> yeah but thats executing probably with computer privileges, not browser privileges.
<Spyrorocks> Its like running javascript from your own filesystem, it can access the filesystem on your pc but as soon as its on a non-local domain it doesnt have enough privileges
<Spyrorocks> Microsoft still never patched the XML exploit
<Spyrorocks> want a demo?
<Spyrorocks> You have IE 7?
<Spyrorocks> Oh then it wont work
<Spyrorocks> Needs IE 7
<Spyrorocks> Theres lots of exploits for IE
<Spyrorocks> an IE 7 SP2 Exploit goes for about $50k
<Spyrorocks> I told you, I know a lot about everything to do with computers.
<Aicebo> 13back
<Yahoo> ......I have to hand in my computer tomorrow..
<Yahoo> I might not be on for a few days
<Aicebo> 13D:
<Aicebo> 13OK
<Rurik> 4You said that
<Yahoo> I know
<Kjakings> 7And we care slightly less each time
<Yahoo> But my new one has Blu-Ray so I am really looking forward to getting it
<Kjakings> 7And we care slightly less each time
<Yahoo> I kow
<Yahoo> *know
<Rurik> 4Then stop sayin it
<Yahoo> ...
<Spyrorocks> Nope.
<Spyrorocks> Wait
<Spyrorocks> what do you mean
<Spyrorocks> For security reasons, a browser is not supposed to be allowed to load any exes from disk and execute them
<Spyrorocks> Same with any plugins for the browser
<Spyrorocks> because as soon as that happens, you can make downloaders that download other apps like adware and dialers.
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: THAT is what a lot of people try to do. Once that happens, it is known as an "exploit".
<Spyrorocks> yes
<Spyrorocks> what?
<Spyrorocks> theres some in system32 too i think
<Spyrorocks> system32 has the default windows wallpapers i think
<Spyrorocks> C:\WINDOWS\Zapotec.bmp
<Kjakings> 7Well now I have nothing to do. Anything interesting going on here?
<Rurik> 4nope
<Kjakings> 7Right then. Time to kill zombies
<Rurik> 4Kja
<Kjakings> 7Ya?
<Rurik> 4you see the video for Left 4 Dead?
<Kjakings> 7No. I may get it, but may not
<Kjakings> 7To me it just looks like they got TF2, Half-life, slammed em together and took out the aliens
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> prince-dari: Thats for the projector
<Spyrorocks> that runs on your own pc
<Kjakings> 7Although technically those zombies in Half-life are alien headcrabs controlling humans, but no-one seems to care anymore
<Spyrorocks> as an exe that loads flash
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> not in the browser
<Kjakings> 7They're still zombies, and a shotgun kills 'em
<Spyrorocks> Trust me, better programmers than me and you have been trying to exploit flash for a very long time.
<Rurik> 4All I do in RE4 if I have the ammo and bored enough
<Rurik> 4or else bring out the blacktail and run around
<Kjakings> 7RE4?
<Rurik> 4Resident Evil 4
<Spyrorocks> Haha, im not very good compared to a lot of people.
<Kjakings> 7Oooh
<Spyrorocks> Theres always someone better.
<Rurik> 4To Dari, you are god
<Rurik> 4He prays for your favor every night
<Rurik> 4:P

<Kjakings> 7TLoS is pwnsome, who doesn't like beating the crap out of an invading army while flying and then pwning evil purple dragons? But they've lost the charm of the original games, doing random skateboarding to get the dragon eggs from the Rhynos before the evil sorceress takes their wings
<EM99> Yes, DFOKN?
<Kjakings> 7Dari: No, but my dad does
<lilgti> em99 he thinks ur a n00b

<Kjakings> 7[/crappyyomommajoke]
<DragonFireOKN> 2Your Mamma is so ugly that when she went to rob a bank she didnt have to wear a mask, she just walked up and said "Put the money in the bag"
<A_Guy> 12Oh my god, stop with the good yo momma jokes.
<Kjakings> 7All Yo Momma jokes are shit. As are all Chuck Norris jokes. And Chuck Norris in general.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Yo Mamma's so stupid she blinked and got lost
<Kjakings> 7Wait for it...
<A_Guy> 12Yo momma's so ugly, she got arrested for carrying a concealed weapon after walking around with a paper bag over her head.
<EM99> They are Chuck Norris FACTS.
<Kjakings> 7Wait for it...
<EM99> Not jokes.
<A_Guy> 12EM99, any other Halo machinimas you recommend I watch?
<Kjakings> 7The only good one is Arby 'n' The Chief
<EM99> No, deus Ex Machina is great.
<Kjakings> 7Meh
<EM99> Not comedy, but action and overall pwn-ful-ness.
<EM99> Also, Machinima's Vociemail Theater is really good.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Guys, stop talking for a second.
<EM99> *Voicemail
<A_Guy> 12I'm watching Red Vs Blue.
<EM99> ^ That sucks.
<DragonFireOKN> 2I want to see how dumb Kjakings is
<Kjakings> 7Oh, thanks

<DragonFireOKN> 2If an electric train is heading north and the wind is blowing south, which way does the smoke blow?
<EM99> Into a wormhole.
<EM99> I know the answer.
<EM99> BTW

<Kjakings> 7It's also pronounced almost exactly the same
<A_Guy> 12Some fish have no eyes.
<Kjakings> 7You undoubtedly got that off a penguin wrapper you're reading
<A_Guy> 12Those kinds of fish live in areas where eyes wouldn't make a difference in the darkness.
<DragonFireOKN> 2Penguins come in wrappers?
<DragonFireOKN> 2Poor birds
<Kjakings> 7Penguin chocolate bar, retard

*Malefor_is_awsome goes to every movietheature and breaks the Twilight movies in half!
<Aicebo> 13The sequels to the original book suck but the first book is good IMO
<EM99> It's just that there's no character development, unless you can call overly-personiying Edward Culpepper or whatever every other sentence with no plot, just what they randomly do.
<Kjakings> 7Oh. I'm going to go talk to the mudkipz people then.

It's kinda like Exodia, only it always ends up on top of the deck and forces itself onto the field in attack mode by sacrificing the rest of the deck (Chuck demands a fancy intro) and gives the opponent a roundhouse kick upon being activated. Only 4 were ever printed, and Seto Kaiba previously owned 3 of them. Being the stupid prick he is he attempted to rip the 4th one so no one could ever u

<Sheena> hi drf
<drfsupercenter> 03hi
<Cynder7> 6<Icydragon>: For putting you through this.
<drfsupercenter> 03I finally got my Xbox 360 to be wireless
<IceWolf> T.T
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to disconnect my router a few times to set up this wireless bridge but it works now
<IceWolf> I still don't know how to do that
<drfsupercenter> 03Stupid thing took me almost 2 hours to set up >_>
<IceWolf> The freaking Elite didn't come with a wireless adapter >.<
<Yahoo> What happened?
<drfsupercenter> 03two options... buy a $100 official USB adapter, or buy a "wireless Ethernet bridge" like I did and go through Hell setting it up
<Cynder7> 6That
<drfsupercenter> 03of course it doesn't, Microsoft is evi
<drfsupercenter> 03l.
<Cynder7> 6Just now
<IceWolf> Or get one on EBAY!
<IceWolf> XP
<Kjakings> 7Can I shoot in with a quick-thrust and say we put her up to this?
<Kjakings> 7PLEASE?
<IceWolf> O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03Cheapest one on eBay was like $80
<Kjakings> 7It can be my christmas present
<Yahoo> NO
<Cynder7> 6What should I say to him?
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought this Ethernet bridge for $35ish on NewEgg
<Icydragon> 12:(
<IceWolf> XP $20 off
<Yahoo> Dont mention me though please
<drfsupercenter> 03the problem with that is that now I have two plugs
<Kjakings> 7DEAL
<drfsupercenter> 03One for the Xbox, one for the bridge
<IceWolf> We don't have ethernet
<Cynder7> 6<Icydragon>: :(
<drfsupercenter> 03and the bridge is a little box with an antenna sticking out of it
<Kjakings> 7HI ICY
<Cynder7> 6He came..
<drfsupercenter> 03... the Xbox does
<Yahoo> Please dont mention me
<Sheena> LAF
<drfsupercenter> 03it comes with an Ethernet cable
<Sheena> *LAG
<Cynder7> 6-_-
<Yahoo> Please dont mention me
<IceWolf> we have a wireless connection throughout our house, though the Elite won't let us connect it
<IceWolf> Wb llots!!
<IceWolf> X3
<Cynder7> 6I'll tell you if he does
<Cynder7> 6*** Kjakings joined #nothere
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I'm saying
<Yahoo> If he does, I will not be pleased
<drfsupercenter> 03same with me
<Cynder7> 6<Kjakings>: HI ICY
<Icydragon> 12......
<IceWolf> At least it'll let me play Mirror's Edge
<drfsupercenter> 03The thing I got is a little box, you plug an Ethernet cable into the Xbox and you plug the other end into the box
<drfsupercenter> 03and it has an antenna
*IceWolf has heart eyes and hugs game case
<Yahoo> Please dont mention me
<drfsupercenter> 03and it connects to a wireless router
<drfsupercenter> 03you get it?
<Kjakings> 7I'm saying that we explained to you what happened which is why you forgave him
<Yahoo> Please don't
<Cynder7> 6I'm in shit now..
<drfsupercenter> 03It just took me a while to set up because I have a password on my router
<Yahoo> No

*Articuno pokes Cute_Riolu for kissing her

<Articuno> 12Loool is there now?!
<Quilava> heh, lol
<Articuno> 12Whats a smooch then?!
<Cute_Riolu> A smooch is more of a longer peck, but still shorter than a kiss.
<Mika> I tripped north of a lodge at the camp I work at over the summer/volunteer
<Articuno> 12They're all kisses to me lol
<Mika> at during the winter

<Articuno> 12It's not always about age, just most of the time XD normally when I ban older people its for other reasons
<Altair> Ragnarok :D

<Altair> I've gotten banned from one site! =D
<Hawkie> 07LOOL
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I've been banned from one website before XD
<xxLatiosxx> 12I'm 17 next year in December (loong way to go XD)
<Hawkie> 07J-Lugia I once set a 24 hour ban in myself
<Hawkie> 07Back in the Falco days
<Articuno> 12asdfasdfomfg
<Hawkie> 07YES
<Altair> Mainly because the kid who was the admin was a newb
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<Aicebo> 13YEEEEES
<Altair> and I spammed the crap outta of it >:D
<Aicebo> 13I FINALLY GOT IT TO ALL STICK ON ONE BIT!
<Aicebo> 13WOOOO!!!
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Altair reminds of a website I still go on XD
*Kipikipo huggles LLOTS.
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas hugs back
<xxLatiosxx> 12I got kicked off a site once, never went back << >>
<Altair> Actually
<Articuno> 12:O
<Altair> I got banned 4 times from that site XD
<Articuno> 12For what reason? If you dont mind me asking
<J-Lugia> The reason why I have never gotten banned is because I was the kid who hid from the rest of the people and watched them from the dark corner of the internet XD
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14lol
<Vyl> I've been kicked off several sites.
<J-Lugia> Until I entered this chat room XP
<Vyl> Including three lifetime bans on one.
<Articuno> 12Ive been temp banned for arguing with someone about Lugia, it was a fail forum that I didnt care about anyway, I just went there to argue
<Altair> Arti, the admin's friend was making fun of one of my best IRL friends
<xxLatiosxx> 12I didn't understand "flamming" at the time, nor do I still fully understand it, I was talking about Pokemon diamond and I got kicked off ovO; probably because I disagreed with someone
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I've only been banned once and that was for using profanities
<Articuno> 12flaming isnt disagreeing or debating, its insulting
<xxLatiosxx> 12O.O
<Altair> I couldn't stand it and I spammed like crazy until they had to close for 2 weeks XD
<Articuno> 12If you say stuff liek NO YOU'RE A DUMBASS FOR THINKING THAT then you will be flaming
<xxLatiosxx> 12I didn't say anything to insult anyone-/
<xxLatiosxx> 12Well thats serebi for you
<Articuno> 12Well then, they fail
<xxLatiosxx> 12Yes indeed
<Articuno> 12Oh THAT site..............
<xxLatiosxx> 12Hehe you dun like it?
*xxLatiosxx high five
<Articuno> 12Well since Id be breaking my own rules if I said what I think, I will be quiet.
<xxLatiosxx> 12Okay ^^
<Vyl> I've been banned on conservapedia three times... Prolifeblocks blocked me because I kept asking why they talk about homosexuality constantly... Uncommon Dissent blocked me because I kept pointing out their mistakes...
<Vyl> *prolifeblogs
<J-Lugia> Well, then, it's a good thing that only a small amount of trollers and flamers have found this site XD
<Articuno> 12Looool
<Vyl> I lost count on dalnet #christian long ago.
<Articuno> 12There arent any trollers and flamers here as far as I know XD
<Nick> Terribii...l
<Articuno> 12Theres just idiots -b-
<Articuno> 12*-v-
<Articuno> 12LOL NICK
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14J-Lugia that's because we have quick reacting staff members to kill them before they troll, flame etc XD
<Nick> Terebiil
<Nick> xD
<J-Lugia> I know! XD
<xxLatiosxx> 12This site is awesome , its the nicest site I've been on ^^
<Hawkie> 07Yay!
*Mika would probably get banned from #christian
<Mika> :P
<Cute_Riolu> Agreed.
<Hawkie> 07^^
<Articuno> 12Meep thanks I try to keep it that way
<Altair> lol LLOTS XD
<Altair> Aka quick kick boot :P
<Articuno> 12I really do try..
<J-Lugia> This is the only site In which I have talked with someone else through the internet XD
<Mika> x3
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14My journal on DA states why I like it here :)
<Hawkie> 07Articuno I remember the little fuss created when I had Umbreon ban me on request >v>
<xxLatiosxx> 12^v^
<Hawkie> 07Ill never do that again LOOOL
<Articuno> 12Wtf Hawkie? XD when was that?
<Hawkie> 07Oh you know
<J-Lugia> And why did you do that?
<Vyl> The easiest place to be banned from is Conservapedia. My current ban is for 'heresy.'
<Articuno> 12I cant remember
<Vyl> Sorry, it's for 'blasphemy.'
<Quilava> ah I remember that
<J-Lugia> What's heresy?
<Vyl> That's the official ban reason.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Hawkie that was with the new spam thingy
<Hawkie> 07when the rule about getting kicked 3 times by cube in a minute = temp ban
<Hawkie> 07I thought i contributed
<Articuno> 12I think he meant hearsay
<Hawkie> 07and felt guilty
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<MayOkami> 12Quan... Featherrrr
<J-Lugia> lol
<Vyl> No, I meant heresy.
<Articuno> 12Ohhhh now I remember
<Altair> hey Aero :>
<AeroDracohem> lol I've found one of the funniest pics ever....
<MayOkami> 12AEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<AeroDracohem> http://bhryn.deviantart.com/art/FF7-AW-36295085
<Hawkie> 07>.>
<Hawkie> 07<.<
<AeroDracohem> MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYo
<Articuno> 12Gotya Vyl.
<Vyl> I was banned for disagreeing with Christian doctrine, as espoused by the admin.
<Altair> Wow
<Altair> that's lame
<Articuno> 12Im gona idle for abit!
<Vyl> And that is why I hate that site.
<AeroDracohem> kk
<Altair> kk Arti
<Vyl> And want to destroy it.
<Cute_Riolu> And that's why I don't consider myself Christian. <<
<xxLatiosxx> 12Okay Arti ^^
<Altair> understandable
<J-Lugia> I hate religion >v>
<Cute_Riolu> Me too.
<Vyl> But I can't troll hard enough to outdo their own insanity.
<Altair> I'm Christian, but I hate it when other Christians attempt to force it on others
<Hawkie> 07LOL
<Hawkie> 07Vyl
<Hawkie> 07Eh.
<Altair> it's a choice ._.
<AeroDracohem> o_o
<Hawkie> 07Religion... I'm afraid of saying what I think.
<Quilava> Vyl, check out the baptists. there as close to real life trolls as you can find <.<;;
<Hawkie> 07So I say I believe one thing ....
<Vyl> I once tried to post that Hitler was gay... and found that this claim was already up there, and by an administrator no less.
<Hawkie> 07But... think something else.
<xxLatiosxx> 12LOL
<Vyl> How can I out-troll that?
<AeroDracohem> o_o
<J-Lugia> Altair, and that's why I hate any kind of religion. If I offended you, I did not mean it, but I wanted to get my point accross
<AeroDracohem> what's... a troll?
<Altair> J, I take no offence to it :P

<Kyu> 02I just cut through one of my old wooden karate boards with my sword >=D
<Cute_Riolu> No.
<Vyl> But be more specific.
<EccoCode> 02Okay...also be warned, I think the PS2 doesn't have any song sharing abilities...and I guess for my question: does GH3 on PS2 if you have it allow song sharing?
<Kyu> 02IT WAS FUN

<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Ecco not that I know of
<Vyl> One speaker, both speakers? Connected to what?

<AeroDracohem> and the light is on, which signifies that it is on.
<EccoCode> 02for the information
<AeroDracohem> but yet, no sound comes out
<AeroDracohem> nothing's on mute
<Vyl> Have you checked the PC volume controls?
<Shara> Check the cords?
<Vyl> Both main and wave?
<Shara> :o
<Shara> Sorry

Yet your fingers are so cold you cant touch any part of you body without it putting you through enourmous pain.
<Aurora> not to mention the dizzyness, the head ache, the stomach ache, and the chivering
<Aurora> shivering
<Sheena> O__o;

<Rocket_Ninetales> 4You?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4How about everyone else?
<Articuno> 12Aww lucky
<Articuno> 12Nothing except watch the fireworks
<Sneasel> 03i only watch
<Articuno> 12I might ask Xai to take me out to the city center though
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Well the last showing is 5:30 - then we're going to hide from people xD
<Articuno> 12Infact
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Nah just kidding - only we don't like big parties lol
<Articuno> 12I need to find out whats going on here at New Year
<Articuno> 12What are you watching?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Twilight
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4We love vampires, hehe
<Articuno> 12Oh yeh! Should have known! My cousin keeps telling me to watch that but meh
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4We will probably watch a few films with a few of Burnett's friends tonight back at the house too - we're not ones for big parties
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Arti, I thought you didn't like blood etc xD but cool
<Articuno> 12Oh dear is it gory?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I dunno haven't seen it yet xD
<NLSendingPBR> sneasel?
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4But vampire films usually are - although this may be different! Ask someone who's seen it.
<Sneasel> 03wazzup lol
<NLSendingPBR> i have a good team in PBR
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4It's aimed at teens/young adults so I doubt it's gorey
<Sneasel> 03yay ^^
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Well, I would have thought Wolf's Rain was gorey xD
<NLSendingPBR> battle?
<Sneasel> 03okay
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I usually love every film I go to see, I wouldn't be a very good critic xD
<NLSendingPBR> 100lvl100
<Sneasel> 03okay
<NLSendingPBR> double
<Sneasel> 03okay :p
<Sneasel> 03yay XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Is Leeds having a big fireworks display, Arti? The nearest major cities here are Newcastle and Sunderland, they probably are. Too far to go on a night though with no transport back. They might have something down the harbour here in Seaham.
<Articuno> 12Im not sure Im looking now ^^
<Sneasel> 03panfernoXD
<NLSendingPBR> jep
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Burnett will be back from Spazda-Walfart soon
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4(Asda-Walmart) So will get going soon as we're taking a walk down the harbour and countryside
<Articuno> 12*sigh*
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4What's wrong? Can't find it?
<Articuno> 12Everything that is going on in Leeds will start at 2pm and end at 5.30 with a firework display.....
<Articuno> 12Xai will be asleep
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4That's strange - none at midnight?
<Sneasel> 03yay
<Articuno> 12None
<NLSendingPBR> no
<Sneasel> 03bye bye rayquaza :p
<Articuno> 12Except probably everyone else's around the city...
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Usually where I live it's private fireworks yeah
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4then in January you get Chinese New Year ^^
<Articuno> 12http://www.leeds.gov.uk/Leisure_and_culture/Arts_and_entertainment/New_Years_Eve_celebrations.aspx
<Articuno> 12V__________V I really want to see the giant butterflies
<Sneasel> 03panferno XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4It's maybe because they want to all go home afterwards to parties, is also why the cinema is closing early.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Aww I would want to aswell
<Sneasel> 03bye bye infernape :p
<NLSendingPBR> kyogre
<Sneasel> 03XD

<Sneasel> 03okay
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I've stayed in every new year til now so this is new to me - except when on holiday in Spain etc
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I prefer internetz to parties xD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Usually they'll put something good on the TV that I won't want to leave the house because of, but not this year.
<Sneasel> 03yay i won XD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Yay
<Articuno> 12I always go out for New Year.. so this';ll suck
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I get really bored at parties which is why I don't go except if it's for a friend
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4And also why I don't go to furmeets anymore - a load of people sat in a pub getting drunk isn't really my thing.
<NL|bath|off> Bye guys
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Bad experiences. xD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4See ya
<Sneasel> 03bye
<Articuno> 12I dont like parties either :>
<Articuno> 12Unless it's like what my family does
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Yeah same here - if there's interesting people there then it's ok. If it's just a load of sitting around on tables being bored like at some weddings I've been to, then it's kinda boring
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4at tables, not on tables LOL
<Articuno> 12Lolz
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Burnett's been saying "So when are we getting married?" And I'm like 'Let's get engaged first' lol
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4That reminded me
<Articuno> 12LOL!
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4So what's everyone else doing for new year's then?
<Lugia> I still need to figure out, got a few options open ^^'
<Lugia> Last year we were at a place an order food at around 12:30, waited untill 4 am foor it >> lol
<Lugia> *and
<Lugia> *ordered
<Lugia> *for
<Lugia> *dies*
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Aww - I'd have ran and got a takeaway and told them to leave it - poor you!
<Articuno> 12I was in London last year -v- never again
<Lugia> Well, it isn't many places that are open around that time on new years day ;>
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Last year I sat in front of the TV all night xD
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I was away from Burnett and I always feel bad when away from him, so didn't want to go out.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4But this year it's great!
<Articuno> 12^^
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Arti - was it bad because it was packed?
<Articuno> 12yes it took us 4.5 hours to do a 5 minute walk down a road to the station..
<Articuno> 12Imagine standing for that long in a crowd the size of ,.. something huge
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I'd have had panic attacks in a crowd that big I think
<Sneasel> 03have to go
<Sneasel> 03bye
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Ok see you
<Sneasel> 03yep
<Sneasel> 03bye
<Articuno> 12I got crushed a couple of times.
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4I get panic attacks just going to Hull city centre
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Aww - were you injured? I hate it when people are selfish like that.
<Articuno> 12No I had Peadge and he stepped in
<Articuno> 12But it did hurt a bit
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4We went to Sunderland city centre yesterday and people bump into me constantly, and it scares me, not sure why, I'm silly.
<Articuno> 12Felt like I was being squeezed really tight.. well I was lol
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4When people crush others - they're only thinking of themselves, it's sad
<Articuno> 12I dont think its silly
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Hi Altair
<Altair> Hey hey
<Rocket_Ninetales> Right I'm off to go get ready to go out as Burnett will be home soon, see you later everyone! Not sure if I'll be back tonight. If not, Happy New Year in advance!
<Articuno> 12Habe fun!!
<Articuno> 12*v
<Altair> Cya RN, and happy new year :>
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4You too - find something even if it's a neighbour's fireworks ^^
<Articuno> 12oh and meep, I have no credit >_<
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4It's ok!
<Articuno> 12Justg letting you know, enjoy!
<Rocket_Ninetales> 4Bye all

<Firasia_Dragryphon> SQUISH THE BIRD
<Hawkie> 07Noooo
*Hawkie flies away
*Firasia_Dragryphon squishes!
<Yahoo> Hello?
<Firasia_Dragryphon> It's a Norwegian Flyng Fish! :>~
<Articuno> 12GUYS
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Flying*
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Yes?
<Articuno> 12It's MINUS TWO DEGREES OUT THERE
<Firasia_Dragryphon> And?
<Articuno> 12And what?
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Thought there was more
<Articuno> 12What more can you add to that?
<Articuno> 12Ovo
<Firasia_Dragryphon> It's one of those "So?" Moments. XD It was just negative twenty nearby earlier.
<Articuno> 12Yeh but this is England
<Articuno> 12and um
<Articuno> 12Do you mean in Faranheight?
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Yup
<Articuno> 12Well I mean in Celcius
<Articuno> 12:/
<Firasia_Dragryphon> What does that come out to in Celcius?
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Er
<Firasia_Dragryphon> I mean F
<Articuno> 12I dunno ovO
<Articuno> 12I cant do F
*Firasia_Dragryphon checks
<Articuno> 12But it's friggin cold here
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Actually, that's not that bad
<Articuno> 12There's freezing fog covering the area <3
<Firasia_Dragryphon> It's only 28.2 degrees F
<Lugia> Articuno, may I ask why you use Calcius in tempreture, but none-metric units in almost everything else...? >> lol
<Firasia_Dragryphon> -20 degrees F is -28.9 degrees C
<Articuno> 12No idea.
<Articuno> 12Wait
<Firasia_Dragryphon> So I think the US has you beat :>
<Articuno> 12You meant me personally right?
<Articuno> 12..............
<Articuno> 12.............
<Articuno> 12I knew it
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Ovo
<Articuno> 12Furry is only Trugia :/
<Lugia> 26 degrees F is 0 degrees C
<Lugia> *36
<Lugia> >>
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Whaaaa?
<Articuno> 12Pretending to be someone else.
<Furry> o.O
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Check the signs next to the numbers, Lugia
<Articuno> 12Why???
<Firasia_Dragryphon> -
<Articuno> 12Why would you try and decieve people >v>
<Firasia_Dragryphon> - isn't just there for looks
*Articuno is going to make a new rule.. although it should have been common sense really >v>
<Firasia_Dragryphon> No gutterizing of minds? Awwww, that's no fun!
<Sleep> retarded
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Ovo
<Sleep> Firasia~
<Sleep> hi
<Hawkie> 07Articuno, which new rule?
<Sleep> 12 lines above
<Firasia_Dragryphon> From what I've seen, no pretending you're somebody else
<Hawkie> 07Ah right.
<Articuno> 12Check the community rules page .
<Hawkie> 07Wait...
<Firasia_Dragryphon> And Articuno broke a rule! ..............The rule of I before E except after C...... >v>
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/content/view/43/
*Hawkie will have to inform a certain birdie about this
<Sleep> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYJEKh9OqEY <3
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Arrow does it a lot, Hawkie?
<Hawkie> 07Fira, no, but we did have something planned
<Articuno> 12I dont care about what goes on in other channels, none of them are in any importance to me
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Ahhh.
<Sleep> TL;DR
<Hawkie> 07Articuno, we're not talking about any of my channels thou. Not for what we'd planned... Like...
<Hawkie> 07In a few months XD
<Hawkie> 07But we'll have to come up with something new with that rule in place.
*Firasia_Dragryphon rereads through the rules and chuckles at one in particular.
<Hawkie> 07And Firasia_Dragryphon, the only thing Arrow has done so far is making me sign on as HawkieHen lol
<Articuno> 12Hawkie, if it's harmless fun... or something you need to do to surprise someone.. then go ahead
<Firasia_Dragryphon> That was funny, Hawkie.
<Articuno> 12But if it's for any dodgy reason, no.
<Hawkie> 07No dodgy reason at all
<Hawkie> 07But ok XD
<Sleep> http://thepowerofless.com/book/ for those interested
<Articuno> 12Would you be allowed to explain what reason it is to me in a PM or cant I hear yet?
<Hawkie> 07Ok Arti, just dont let anyone else in on it.
<Hawkie> 07PM incoming.
<Lugia> what about me Hawkie...? v
<Hawkie> 07Lugia not you.
<Furry> Articuno: I am not 'Trugia' o.O
<Articuno> 12Right
<Altair> .
<Articuno> 12Then why does your name say Trugia?
<Firasia_Dragryphon> [07:35]	-->|	Furry (Trugia@d83-189-171-198.cust.tele2.ch) has joined #SilverWings
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Evidence.
<Articuno> 12You want to keep lying to us?
<Furry> Articuno: I am using his laptop o.O
<Furry> doesn't mean I am him o.O
<Articuno> 12I said stop lying.
*Firasia_Dragryphon sighs, hears this excuse a lot from all over, never believes it anymore.
<Yahoo> ..................................................
<Articuno> 12You didn't seem to know who Trugia was the last time I asked you if you were him.
<Furry> I'm not lying
<Articuno> 12More lies?
<Furry> I'm at a furmeet o.O
<Furry> using a fur's laptop
<Furry> doesn't mean i know him
<Articuno> 12-v-;;;;;
*Firasia_Dragryphon bursts out laughing!
<Articuno> 12I can't believe people would lie to cover up their lies......
<Firasia_Dragryphon> My computer is the only privacy I've ever had. To let somebody ELSE use my computer means 1, I have to know them. 2, I have to trust them, wholly and completely.
<Hawkie> 07I dont borrow my computer to complete strangers =/
<Hawkie> 07*lend
<Sleep> zzz
<Firasia_Dragryphon> The only person I would ever let use my computer would be my roommate, and my girlfriend.
<Firasia_Dragryphon> people*
<Furry> don't belive me huh? visit CA
<Articuno> 12* Furry1 (Furry@d83-176-45-230.cust.tele2.ch) has joined #silverwings
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Hell, Articuno is my wingsister, I trust her and everything, and even though we exchanged feathers, I still wouldn't let her on my computer.
<Articuno> 12I suppose you were using his laptop then as well huh?
<Articuno> 12That was a log from last week by the way
<Articuno> 12Infact all the logs have your IP on them
<Articuno> 12So you must only be using Trugia's laptop
<Articuno> 12Just stop the frikkin lying....
<Furry> Ehh, not worth my time here
<Hawkie> 07o.O
<Articuno> 12ohhhh what, gonna run off now?
<Articuno> 12Can't lie any further?
<Furry> You think I'm someone else
<Articuno> 12No I don't
<Sleep> drama
<Furry> no point in arguing
<Articuno> 12I KNOW you're someone else.
<Articuno> 12Infact I'd very much like you to leave.
<Hawkie> 07Sleep: Seen worse. This seems to be easy to get into order.
<Hawkie> 07Articuno? -> http://ziali.deviantart.com/art/golden-eagle-107959068
<Articuno> 12Well if you call telling people off for doing dodgy things on chat "drama" then drama will always follow the mods/admins.
<Sleep> bulbagarden's much worse. They have actual noobs in the mix
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Hawkie: I've been through much worse. I still haven't recovered from August through October's RL and OL drama, and I probably won't for some time to come.
<Articuno> 12So "Furry", leave please or I will remove you..
<Furry> for god sake, is it hard to belive a couple share a laptop?
<Furry> Articuno: I'l leave
<Furry> don't worry
<Articuno> 12Oh so now it's that is it?
<Altair> >_>
<Firasia_Dragryphon> [07:48]	<Furry>	doesn't mean i know him
*Hawkie rolls her eyes
<Firasia_Dragryphon> So first he doesn't know Trugia, and now he's a couple?
<Articuno> 12His reaction when I said "Trugia is that you?" - "Articuno, huh..?"
<Hawkie> 07Idiot.
<Altair> ffs
<Sleep> do you have anything against trugia?
<Articuno> 12I didnt till now
<Hawkie> 07Sleep he's acting like a bastard really
<Hawkie> 07Same as Arti
<Hawkie> 07Look, when someone puts themselves out to be an idiot, then hey, people WILL dislike ya.
<Hawkie> 07>v>
<Articuno> 12He's been deceiving people here.. and in that case, he knows the rules here too.. but broke them claiming he didnt know them (by posting NSFW stuff)
<Articuno> 12I don't know WHY anyone would do things like this..
<Firasia_Dragryphon> Claiming ognorance does not exempt from the law.
<Altair> no life?
<Firasia_Dragryphon> ignorance*
<Articuno> 12and also.. why he PMed me saying Falco brought him here Ovo;
<Sleep> alright.
<Articuno> 12when I asked him if he was Trugia
<Hawkie> 07Falco ovO
<Articuno> 12Yes Falco would NEVER refer random people here
<Hawkie> 07How is he holding up anyway?
<Hawkie> 07Gotten over the past I hope? :p
<Articuno> 12So I questioned him and he didnt answer properly .. so I've been keeping an eye on him
<Articuno> 12Hawkie I dont knoq
<Articuno> 12*know
<Hawkie> 07LOL q
<Articuno> 12I don't keep contact

<Jess> i wish I had my new lense when i was on the WSR the other day
<Articuno> 12You know what sucks..

<Nick> what?
<Hawkie> 07I have a nikon d80..
<Articuno> 12The South Devon Railway closes in Winter >v>;

<Vyl> Three of them are in such a state. The fourth is restored.
<Jess> i hav 5 up there I think
<Vyl> Every now and again the trust that runs it will start the engine so people can see it go.
<Vyl> And make it the centerpiece of a steam fair.
*Articuno whines..

<Articuno> 12XD
<Articuno> 12Oh yes I remember
<Articuno> 12You were going to mod it
<Vyl> So I took it home and took it apart.
<Vyl> Trying to make it brighter. But I couldn't fit enough batteries in, so I just took it for components.
<Articuno> 12Shame

<Articuno> 12LOL NICK!!!
<Jess> annoying Northerner
<Jess> XP
<Nick> blame tier D:
<Nick> xD
<Vyl> The first. Because it's more exposed. The second is just a cylinder, all the workings hidden from view. The first has pipes, valves, pistons, all the little tubes of mysterious purpose visible to be pondered over.
<Jess> o.O
*Nick is a bloody northerner :P
<Articuno> 12I cant tell which I prefer sorry.
<Articuno> 12I dont exactly know anything about either
*Jess is a bloody Southener
<Jess>

<Nick> stupid geordie influence :S
<Jess> South rules XP
<Nick> I had a yorkshire accent at one time
<Articuno> 12Vyl, are you sure it's exposed? Is it the type of engine because I can barely make the picture out.. it's tiny
<Vyl> It's more exposed. I can see pipes.
<Jess> i never liked the look of the US engines
<Articuno> 12Nick did I tell you that on the way to see you, there were some kids behind me with the exact same accent as you and I couldnt understand them either..
<Jess> and theyre are a bit tooo big
<Articuno> 12I can't see anything :/ it's too small
<Nick> lol
<Articuno> 12Bigger is ALWAYS better
<Nick> south shields accent
<Nick> I was born in S.Shields
<Jess> not if its big and chunky
<Articuno> 12Depends
<Jess> thats y i prefer UK engines
<Nick> and Jess I just read up, do you has link for the photos on the WSR site? :D
<Nick> and of course UK engines rule, we invented rail travel :P
<Jess> lol
<Jess> http://www.wsr.org.uk/cgi-bin/pixpage3.cgi?h=Winter%20Steam%20Festival%202008&t=wsf2008pix&j=121
<Jess> the next 5 are mine too
<Nick> ok!
<Vyl> And we decided to use ancient egyptian dimensions for the rail.
<Nick> oh yeah I saw that first one on DA :O
<Nick> thats really nic one :)
<Jess> UK engines look much more sophisticated (cant spell)
<Articuno> 12http://www.wsr.org.uk/cgi-bin/pixpage3.cgi?h=Winter%20Steam%20Festival%202008&t=wsf2008pix&j=124

<Kyogre> 03LOOOOOOOOOOL
<Hawkie> 07MayOkami|Writingz
<Hawkie> 07At least your story concepts arnt so fished up as mine are
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12I'm not sure what that means Hawkie
<Hawkie> 07Well
<Hawkie> 07The plotline doesnt seem to be as messed up as my ideas for stories are
<Hawkie> 07I didnt manage to enter the competition
<Hawkie> 07But if I had it wouldve been one hell of a weird story
<Hawkie> 07Lol
<Hawkie> 07Hi
<Sneas> Hi.
<Altair> hey Sneas :>
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12I lie weird stories
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12*like
<Hawkie> 07May, here's my plotline idea for the competiton. I never got to write it though
<Hawkie> 07So might as well just say it.
<Hawkie> 07Since it was a love-story, I assumed that Lugia and Articuno would get married at one point -- with Lugia wanting to porpose to her under the mistletoe (to involve the theme, y'know?) -- but they'd have to find it. Seems fine so far... Right.
<Hawkie> 07
<Hawkie> 07I would've revealed this in the story if I'd ever gotten that far -- Ho-oh somehow getting the bright idea that he wanted Articuno for himself. After all, Lugia was less of a bird than he was, although he'd have done his fair share of bribery and convincing to get Lugia to agree to this... Giving up Arti and letting him have her, that is.
<Hawkie> 07And to cover it up, Lugia had Zapdos and Moltres make this stew thing that they would apply to the leaves of the mistletoe, which of course, again, to include the theme, could only be found in one place. That way, Lugia would look innocent.
<Hawkie> 07
<Hawkie> 07When Lugia and Articuno went to find the mistletoe, she wouldn't suspect much, with Lugia encouraging her to pick it up -- and she'd have to do this with her beak, as there's really no other effective way of plucking a plant for a bird.
<Kyogre> 03too much oranga @_@
<Kyogre> 03orange
<Hawkie> 07This way, it would be unavoidable for her to lap up some of the substance applied to it earlier, resulting in her losing grasp of reality for a bit... Which is where Ho-oh would've entered the picture, claimed Arti, still with the mistletoe in her beak, and that would be that.
<Yahoo> ...wtf?
*Hawkie ends the summary of her thought-out plotline.
<Icydragon> 12.......
<Aicebo> 13.........
<Altair> Ovo
<Hawkie> 07Kyogre I'm done now. I was just showing MayOkami|Writingz what I meant with having weird story ideas. :p
<Icydragon> 12:(
<Articuno> 12Dammit I wish you'd just written it LOL

<Kyogre> 03lol
<Aicebo> 13hi.
<Icydragon> 12Hi......
<Altair> That's...original XD
<Altair> I kinda like the idea of it though, sounds funny XD
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12Keep going Hawkie, I like it so far
<Hawkie> 07MayOkami|Writingz that was all of it. It was just a plot summary
<Hawkie> 07[16:51:21] <Articuno> Dammit I wish you'd just written it LOL <- What do you mean? LOL
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12Oh
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO READ D<
<Articuno> 12It sounded like a brilliant story
<Nick> http://caupolican.deviantart.com/art/FORK-OFF-107742741 <--epic

<Aicebo> 13Meow.
<Kjakings> 7Cheeze
<Twilight-Latiwolf> 03Now I need to use complete sentences and make them make sense. xD
<Yahoo> Meow meow
<Quanyails> 7Why is the chest of your Articunos a white color instead of a light-blue tuft?
<Kjakings> 7Om nom nom?
<Yahoo> Nomommeownom
<Articuno> 12I told you before
<Articuno> 12The sprite colours are incorect....
<Articuno> 12Articuno's chest has ALWAYS been white
<Articuno> 12In every piece of merchandise, in every show/movie
<Articuno> 12In the old games
<Articuno> 12I dont know WHY they started changing colours around on Pokemon, it's stupid
<Kjakings> 7Kek
<Kjakings> 7I'mma go kill zombehz. ON HOVARBOARDS =D
<Icydragon> 12YAAAAAAAY!
<MayOkami|Writingz> 12Like Luiga's back fins and eye fins turned black
<Aicebo> 13lol..
<Shara> Wait
<Articuno> 12Yeh and it's wrong
<Shara> It's the talons that have changed, right?
<Articuno> 12Legs/beak
<Articuno> 12The talons are white
<Shara> <_<;
<Shara> I was close
<Articuno> 12The legs/beak changed to yellowish
<Articuno> 12Which looks awful..
*Shara nods
<Shara> It does
<Shara> I like the grayish look
<Shara> liked*
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, even in the anime, it seems bluish.
<Yahoo> My guinea pig gave birth today
<Shara> The anime never stays true to the games, though.
<BlueFusion> Wow, it was 9 months ago i met her?
<Quanyails> 7And yes, I just checked
<Articuno> 12No the anime is shaded QUan
<Yahoo> Well, one out of 18
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/media/screenshots/artiep2/PDVD_150.jpg
<Articuno> 12In broad daylight
<Yahoo> BlueFusion, of you from Holland?
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/media/screenshots/artiep2/PDVD_543.jpg

<Yahoo> Then you are not him
<Articuno> 12With dark lighting
<Yahoo> You aren't Saffy
<Articuno> 12Its still white
<Quanyails> 7That still has a bluish tint.
<Articuno> 12No it doesnt
<Articuno> 12heh
<Articuno> 12Compare it to the talons
<Articuno> 12They're all white
*Twilight-Latiwolf doesn't think it has a bluish tint. =/
<Articuno> 12and the eyes
<Articuno> 12It's just that you cant get perfect #FFFFFF on a screen ovO
<Articuno> 12Eyes the are most certainly not blue..
<Articuno> 12and the only way to shade white is with grey/blue-grey
<Sneas> zzzzt
<Nick> http://www.lugia.us/media/screenshots/artiep2/PDVD_150.jpg I think this screen looks scary D:
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Hawkie> 07perfect #FFFFFF <- LOOOOOL

<Deathbat> 10Was it because I saw another celebrity lookalike?
<Shara> Bai
<Shara> I've always thought the evolution of pokemon was interesting
<Shara> Like Jynx
<Articuno> 12Also, take this http://articuno.deviantart.com/art/Lugia-x-Articuno-Wave-Watching-64938476
<Yahoo> *headdesk*
<Deathbat> 10I answer questions with questions!
<Articuno> 12and compare that to #FFFFFF
<Shara> At the moment, is Jynx Purple or black?
<Articuno> 12Blue tinted? Of course, look at the surroundings and shading..
<Deathbat> 10Dani Filth = filthy cow?
*Shara compares
<Articuno> 12Thats how art works
<Icydragon> 12o_o
<Yahoo> Forget it..
<Shara> White?
<Articuno> 12Even the eyes of Lugia and Arti are slightly that colour..
<Deathbat> 10Fine ^_^
<Articuno> 12Doesnt mean Articuno's chest was purposely coloured blue
<Articuno> 12It's meant to be dark white.
<Shara> Really?
<Shara> Like a cream-ish?

<Quanyails> 7Arti's anime tuft color looks almost greenish. o.O
<Icydragon> 12Hell yes.
<Articuno> 12White takes on the colour of whatever the surroundings are
<Quanyails> 7When compared to white and a blue-grey
<Articuno> 12The point is..if you look at it head on, you can see it's meant to be white. Plainly ovbious
<Articuno> 12*obvious
<Articuno> 12http://www.lugia.us/templates/lugia_and_articuno/images/logo.png

<Articuno> 12Not perfectly
<Articuno> 12but yeh
<Shara> I miss the old pokemon movies
<Nick> I thought the third was pretty bleh
*Quanyails 7pokes the Chat Stats
<Articuno> 12Yes it was
<Quanyails> 7 8 	Articuno and Rocket_Ninetales
<Quanyails> 7 8 	Articuno and drfsupercenter
<Quanyails> 7 8 	Articuno and LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<Quanyails> 7 6 	Articuno and Nick
<Quanyails> 7 5 	Articuno and AeroDracohem
<Quanyails> 7 5 	Articuno and Aurora
<Quanyails> 7 4 	Articuno and Lord_of_Lozenges
<Quanyails> 7O.o
<Articuno> 12the third was the worst one they made beside the 9th
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Quanyails> 7Delayed reaction? o.O
<Nick> fourth was quite boring
<Nick> fifth: Awesome :D
<Articuno> 12I liked the fourth, not bad
<Articuno> 12Yeh EVERYONE loves the fifth
<Quanyails> 7Or was that lag?
<Shara> i loved the 9th
<Articuno> 12The fav movies tend to be 1, 2, 5, 7 and 8
<Quanyails> 7 20 	Quanyails 	[239] [173] [230] 642 	 "ARTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII" <--Lol. XP
<Articuno> 12Sorry i really thought the 9th was a bad story line.. infact it was exactly like 6
<Shara> o.o'
<J-Lugia> Which were those?
<Articuno> 12Jirachi and Manaphy
<Shara> 9 = manaphy
<Articuno> 12To sum them up.. evil man wants to use little cute Pokemon for some evil deed
<Shara> 9 was more cute, though
<Articuno> 12and one of the characters ends up getting attached to them
<Nick> yeah some stupid looking pirate :|
<Articuno> 12and then they save the world and yay
<J-Lugia> That's just plain annoying
<Articuno> 129 failed, so did 10 actually.. it was eye candy, good to watch, crap storyline that went on and on
<Articuno> 12I can't believe 11 was just a follow on of 10 -_____________-
*Nick wonders when they'll stop making Pkmn movies?
<Articuno> 12I dont ever want them to stop :O they make good ones at times
<Nick> its getting a bit of a fad now unless they can get good writers
<Articuno> 12But they seem to have peeked at 8 XD we'll see
<Articuno> 12Pokemon is meant to be like Disney
<Nick> eight I've still yet to see
<Articuno> 12Never stopping XD
<Shara> okay
<Shara> 10 FAILED
<Shara> I cried from 9
<Articuno> 12Im sure you'll love eight, it's really good. But DONT DONT DONT DONT dONT watch the dub!!!!!!
<Nick> yeah but only in Japan, Im not sure the west cares much for the movies/cartoon anymore, only the games
<Articuno> 12It's ONLY good in subtitles!
<Articuno> 12yeh true
<Nick> how so?
<Shara> only thing 10 was good for was watching ash fist fight a pokemon
<Articuno> 12Story line is better, less childish.. voices arent childish
<Nick> but the dub has the voice of Goku in it! :O GOKUUU!
<Articuno> 12Ovo?
<Shara> 8 = Rayquaza?
<Articuno> 12Dub anything fails
<Articuno> 12No 8 = Lucario
<Articuno> 127 - Rayquaza
<Shara> ....OH
<Icydragon> 12Haha!
<Nick> (the voice of Goku voices Lucario in movie 8)
<Nick> didnt you know that? xD
<Shara> Got them mixed
<Articuno> 12No because I turned the dub off in 2 seconds XD
<Articuno> 12It was horrible.
<Shara> ash fist faught a pokemon in 8
<Articuno> 12Sounds like he's going through puberty LOLOL
<Articuno> 12Has a much more realistic voice in the original..

<Hawkie> 07that is not a lugia ovO

<Deathbat> 10Yahoo are you staying up for like yano?
<Skylands> 12That was a fast bbl lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I could make a claim that I 100% Dragonforce on expert and upload a video of me doing so (I never will of course not for a while anyway), but it still states the fact that I could be faking it like most people do
<Yahoo> ?
<Yahoo> dunno
<Deathbat> 10Are you staying up until 12? 
<Yahoo> dunno
<Deathbat> 10I'll see if I can pull an all-nighter XD
<Hail> 12@Yahoo: Icy als o said you his light & world He loves you with all his heart. He misses you as soon as you leave.
<wdearth> I still think that song has been fc'd without a bot. If the guitarists of Dragonforce could do such rapidfire notes, then so can someone else.
<Deathbat> 10Idk why... and I have about 3 dvds to watch.
<Aicebo> 13Hey SR
<Deathbat> 10Hey Spyrorocks

<Hail> 12o.o;; I shouldn't have said that, should I Icy?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Depends Obsi
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I find real guitaring easier
<Hawkie> 07Obsi some might find it that way
<Yahoo> It sucks
<Icydragon> 12No....
<Hail> 12Awh, crap...
<Deathbat> 10WUT

<LLOTS|GuitarHero> 14Take a guess (NO IT'S NOT DRAGONFORCE)
<raven> 82F=29C
<RedDragonX> 82?...wow you lucky sob lol

<Aicebo> 13The snow is almost all gone here.
<LLOTS|GuitarHero> 14Metallica - One is one of the hardest songs on GH3
<Black_Latios> 02the end is really hard
<Spyrorocks> Aicebo: I still have like 4 feet drifts.

<Aicebo> 13I guess
<Cynder7> 6lol
<Aicebo> 13We got a blizzard a week or two ago
<Spyrorocks> slush is the worst, because it gets cold again right after it turns to slush then everything gets slippery with ice.
<Black_Latios> 02i dunno how to make skins >_>
<raven> Wow, nice. How deep is it where you are now, RDX?
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, me and Aicebo had a decent snow blizzard.
<Cynder7> 6Ya
<RedDragonX> right now it's not that bad...mainly because we have gotten rain for the last 2 weeks...I would say about three feet or so
<raven> Sounds hazardous and chilly
<RedDragonX> but it's more cold and icy here then anything else
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<raven> Must be hard when the roads get freezed over.
<raven> to drive
<Black_Latios> 02hey Twilight-Latiwolf , who did you choose as your partner?
<RedDragonX> try driving on it
<RedDragonX> I have to glide
<DDR_Maniac> We had to leave to go home early because the weather was going to be bad
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Spyrorocks> ddr, did you fly ?

<Twilight-Latiwolf> 03Pachirisu. He was too cute. T-T
<DDR_Maniac> Yeah, we stopped at a hotel
<RedDragonX> 8 months of winter and 4 months of semi-summer

<DDR_Maniac> I guess with 5 kids in the car
<Black_Latios> 02Munchlax serves ok for just 10 seconds, then those "!!!" appear and i'm dead
<DDR_Maniac> Why did you go twice?
<raven> Lol, sounds like quite a job for the parents.

<Xelig00n> 12when someone on a big movie comp go emo, he just report 10 amvs...

<Xelig00n> 12really fun :/
<Skylands> 12I actually got done typing a whole paragraph of disclaimer stuff on my channel lol
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Hmm speaking of which
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Wonder if my AMV is stil lthter
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14still there*
<IceWolf> heh
<Skylands> 12I saw your Legendary Dogs AMV disappeared, Aurora ._.

<Aurora> ./-\.
<Aurora> WTFEESH IT DID?!
<Aurora> *checks*
<Skylands> 12It wasn't there Ovo
<flame1996> I haven't played AHT for ages.
<IceWolf> But what's weird llots, is that my very first amv I used a nickleback song and it didn't get blocked
<IceWolf> from the same cd and everything -.-
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14I have no idea
<Cynder7> 6Ugh
<Cynder7> 6I haven't played it since the summer that past
<IceWolf> I found that sending my amv's through sharing folders on msn is a lot faster
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> 14Youtube is just being a f***ed up piece of crap about the copyright and all that jazz
<Cynder7> 6I registered somewhere with a fake lastname..
<IceWolf> mhm
<Aurora> But it was there just yesterday
<Aurora> I saw it
<Skylands> 12Well, they do that because they could get sued by the owners
<flame1996> I think when someone comes downstairs I have to go..probaly
<IceWolf> I wish I could send it to you, but yeah..evil msn
<IceWolf> -.- Everyone uses Savin' Me by Nickleback
<Cynder7> 6Ok..D=
<IceWolf> there are millions of amvs out there with that song
<IceWolf> not just me >.<
<Cynder7> 6Damn
<Cynder7> 6Do you think I should activate it?
<Aurora> lol
<Skylands> 12I haven't used that song yet lol
<IceWolf> heh
<SilvertheArticuno> I havent used it either Ovo
<flame1996> Actiavte what?
<Skylands> 12I have "If everyone cared" though..
<IceWolf> I wanted to make my own version of the amv with the couple.
<IceWolf> Same
<Aurora> well I guess that vid got taken down yesterday then
<Skylands> 12:/
<Cynder7> 6The account with the false lastname

<IceWolf> my first amv with that song
<IceWolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko74OOXMAOw
<flame1996> I don't understand what it is.
<Cynder7> 6Ok
<Skylands> 12If you think about it, Youtube will lose most of their users because most people are there for AMVs, not those cruddy videos about themselves lol
<Xelig00n> 12lol
<SilvertheArticuno> Thats true!
<Xelig00n> 12They're there for AMV's and people hurting themselves...
<IceWolf> mhm..
<Cynder7> 6I made this account and stuff.I had to put a lastname and I tried just putting P which usually works.Then it told me it was invalid so I made up a lastname and put it.Now I have to activate the avccount with the false lastname..
<Skylands> 12IceWolf I sent an invite xD
<SilvertheArticuno> 15Agreed xD

<Quanyails> 7I've been thinkin' a li'l.
<Quanyails> 7But I'd like to know your fortes in art. :3
<Articuno> 12Hmm.. birds
<Articuno> 12Pokemon..
<Articuno> 12and watery backgrounds
<Nick> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Articuno> 12I suck at everything else
<Nick> Happy new year :D
<Quanyails> 7Hrm...
<Articuno> 12LOL Hi Nick! Happy New Year ^v^
<Articuno> 12What have you been up to?
<Vyl> Articuno,
<Quanyails> 7What about fur, Arti?
<Vyl> I have that program.
<Nick> Went out with family last night then had a party round mine today
<Articuno> 12Quan, this is the best fur I can do. http://articuno.deviantart.com/art/She-Loves-Me-106619253
<Nick> you?
<Vyl> The style is a bit flashy, but lots of pigeon information.
<Articuno> 12What program Vyl.....?
<Articuno> 12The Peadge one?
<Vyl> Yep.
<Vyl> Want it? I have a torrent.
<Articuno> 12Yeh I found it flashy myself, I thought it was going to be more like a regular documentary
<Articuno> 12I have it
<Articuno> 12Nick, I've done nothing sadly
<drfsupercenter> 03Wow, 38 minutes to save a mp3
<drfsupercenter> 03Granted, it is about 5 hours long
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Vyl> Nat Geo used to be a very serious, factual, documentory channel.
<Vyl> But in recent years they have been forced to lower standards to attract enough viewers to be profitable.
<Articuno> 12Oh dear -v-
<Quanyails> 7Ah, Arti: I think I'll sketch a concept design and we'll go from there. :3
<Articuno> 12Sure Quan!
<Quanyails> 7'k
<Quilava> is Quan getting a commission?
<Articuno> 12Nope ^^ prize
<Yahoo> 2Finger bleeding :)
<Quilava> ohhh
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03speaking of TV stuff
<Articuno> 12The competition one
<Quilava> lucky her ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03I FINALLY convinced my parents that a 50" plasma isn't too big
<drfsupercenter> 03so we're gonna get one... probably tomorrow
<Articuno> 12LOL DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom would have gotten it today but of course the stores are closed
<drfsupercenter> 03Well it's partially a money issue
<EccoCode> 02Arti, can you give any info on what the next competition topic will be? or too soon to ask?
<drfsupercenter> 03My mom wanted like 46", and those were about $1800
<drfsupercenter> 03compared to $2000 for the 50"
<drfsupercenter> 03My dad found a 50" at Costco for $1445
<Articuno> 12No topic, but it will be a photography competition
<drfsupercenter> 03So I was like "Yeah, that's cheaper than the others"
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I was like "OK, look, my dad and I and my sisters think 50" isn't too big... and you NEVER watch TV in the basement, why is it such a big deal to you?"
<Articuno> 12Ovo;
*Nick pats Arti :(
<drfsupercenter> 03And thankfully it worked
<Nick> sorry to hear. Why didnt you do anythign?
<Articuno> 12Because Xai was working..
<Nick> :(
<Articuno> 12We did make a fry up and watch Kung Fu Panda though, thats one of my fav films now
<Nick> I have to watch that
<gerpie> rawr
<Articuno> 12OMG watch it with us!
<Vyl> I don't like Nat Geo any more... it shows trash and lies to bring in the ratings.
<Articuno> 12^v^
<RedDragonX> bark
<EccoCode> 02I haven't watched that movie.
<Articuno> 12Vyl, like what lies..?
<Yahoo> 2Skadoosh
<Yahoo> 2Finger bleeding :)
<gerpie> ey reddrago
<RedDragonX> sup gerp
<IceWolf> hmm
<RedDragonX> and what is with the whole finger bleeding lol
<RedDragonX> you cutting yourself or something
<Yahoo> 2My finger /is/ bleeing
<Yahoo> 2:)
<Vyl> Every Christmas and Easter, they show lots of programs about Jesus which are quite deceptive - because that's what it takes to drag up the viewers.
<RedDragonX> and how did you manage that
<Vyl> Easy ratings.
<Yahoo> 2Bit it
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Vyl
<Yahoo> 2:P
<gerpie> *sigh*
<drfsupercenter> 03I never watched National Geographic Channel, just their DVD stuff
<gerpie> i need 2 go sleep soon >:{
<RedDragonX> what were you eating and you bit yourself lol
<drfsupercenter> 03because they have some documentaries on DVD that are good
<IceWolf> wait..what now? -.-''..that show needs to be taken off the air then
<Nick> they showed this good doc called ocean voyagers
<gerpie> stupid parends ;[
<RedDragonX> what's sleep
<drfsupercenter> 03and ironically it's channel 69 on my cable, so every time there's a show about animals mating I like to make jokes
*drfsupercenter hides
<Altair> Ovo
<IceWolf> -.- let me guess..they think they found the ark or something?
<Nick> no it was about humpbck whales :P
<Vyl> IceWolf, the last one I saw was about the ten plagues of egypt. It explained how they really happened.
<IceWolf> oh..lol XP
<RedDragonX> can't win them all I suppose
<Rurik> 4Why did you bite your finger?
<Kyu> 02....
<Vyl> But the arguments they used were clutching at straws - they would accept one-in-a-million possibilities without doubt and ignore what I could see were obvious problems.
<Yahoo> 2*nail
<Rurik> 4are you THAT hungery?
<IceWolf> The ten plagues of Egypt occured in the Bible >.>..
<Yahoo> 2.....Yes
<Kyu> 02no religious topics on here
<Vyl> Anything to avoid even *suggesting* that the plagues didn't happen, because that would upset some viewers.
<Rurik> 4go make somethihng
<IceWolf> ..sorry
<Yahoo> 2With what?
<Yahoo> 2Tabacco?!
<Rurik> 4idk
<Rurik> 4make a sandwich
<Vyl> As I said, easy ratings. Works in religion on politics - tell the viewers what they want to see.
<gerpie> lol
<Yahoo> 2With what? Tabacco?!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Vyl> Most NG programs are made primarily for a US audients.
<Rurik> 4sure
<drfsupercenter> 03I like Discovery Channel
<Yahoo> 2That's all that is here
<Yahoo> 2Not even bread!
<drfsupercenter> 03as those aren't really screwed up
<Vyl> Discovery channel is very variable... I think they have different departments.
*Yahoo 2folds a cigarette over
<Yahoo> 2Taadaaaa
<drfsupercenter> 03MythBusters ftw, I know it's not really "educational" but it's cool
<drfsupercenter> 03and shows like It Takes a Thief
<drfsupercenter> 03is cool
<RedDragonX> why not
<Rurik> 4So you smoke?
<RedDragonX> world is drugged up enough anyways
<IceWolf> I don't like how scientists try to prove the Word wrong -.-
<Yahoo> 2No
<Yahoo> 2My mum does.
<Yahoo> 2I don't plan to smoke
<EccoCode> 02Discovery where I live doesn't air It Takes A Thief, or at least I don't know when it comes on anymore, I use to watch that one DRF. At least Mythbusters is on currently!
<Vyl> So they could be showing the highest standards one minute, and in the next timeslot is a program about how snakes use their magic mouse-tracking sense, complete with a computer-overlay view of how a snake sees a mouse with targeting crosshairs.
<Rurik> 4and you just HAPPEN to have Tabacco
<RedDragonX> yay for second hand smoke
<Rurik> 4no wonder you have a child
<Rurik> 4:D
<Yahoo> 2It's my MUMS
<Nick> yeah my thoughts too...instead of spending all the tmie proving things wrong why not prove something right?
<Articuno> 12Me and Xai only watch nature and engineering programs anyway :/ oh and Mythbusters LOL
<Yahoo> 2It's /my/ MUMS
<drfsupercenter> 03I also liked Cash Cab
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure what that has anything do with what Discovery is about but LOL
<Shara> Mythbusters = Win
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah it does
<drfsupercenter> 03I have the entire DVD set
<drfsupercenter> 03all 8 of them
<Articuno> 12Cool!
<drfsupercenter> 03and a couple "MythBusters collection"s
<drfsupercenter> 03they're like $20 at Blockbuster
<Vyl> The only producers I know with consistantly high standards are the BBC and CBS.
<Articuno> 12I first watched that in America you know!
<drfsupercenter> 03so if I have some spare cash I get them
<drfsupercenter> 03BBC made Planet Earth... and I know that was really popular
<RedDragonX> hm
<RedDragonX> and hello again gerp lol
<IceWolf> I like Ghost Hunter's. I know that's random
<Vyl> Both because they arn't required to maximise ratings to remain profitable.
<drfsupercenter> 03I only saw one episode of it.. it seemed a bit too slow-moving for me
<Articuno> 12Im going to bed now ^v^
<drfsupercenter> 03Darn it
<Vyl> Sleep well.
<drfsupercenter> 03but LOL cya
<Articuno> 12XD
<IceWolf> Night Arti! ^^

<gerpie> 7i wont
<RedDragonX> you are who you are and nobody can change that
<gerpie> 7did u ever hadt a line?
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> I live by one motto pretty much
<RedDragonX> Be the best you can be every day, and life will reward you when the time is right. Keep your loved ones close and try to see the best in people.
<gerpie> 7;D
<gerpie> 7anyways
<gerpie> 7can i ask something?
<RedDragonX> go ahead
<gerpie> 7are you religious?
<RedDragonX> I have my personal beliefs yes
<gerpie> 7im a christian
<Kyu> 02arf
<RedDragonX> so am I
<gerpie> 7;D
<RedDragonX> but I see things the way I do
<RedDragonX> none of us will ever really know until we meet our end
<gerpie> 7yea
<gerpie> 7i think aicebo is pretty dumb
<RedDragonX> but if anything is beyond this world. I will live my life every day being the best person I can be...and if fate see's fit to reward me then it will be so
<gerpie> 7he says there is no treu religion
<RedDragonX> Aicebo is a she lol
<gerpie> 7lol
<gerpie> 7dang xD
<RedDragonX> and she has her own personal beliefs just like anyone else does
<gerpie> 7yea
<RedDragonX> your not going to change them or influence them
<gerpie> 7but stil
<RedDragonX> it's a pretty pointless thing to argue about
<gerpie> 7yea
<Sheena> !ping
<gerpie> 7so true
<Quilava> dinner now! see ya peoples ^^
<drf|away> !pong
<Sheena> TABLE
<Sheena> see ya Quil
<RedDragonX> All I will live by is the way I want to live my life
<RedDragonX> that's it
*Sheena is listening to Lifehouse ~ Broken
<Sheena> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZXHYItXWqE
<Sheena> =3
<gerpie> 7she stormy and me have chnatted bout kit for hours
*Kipikipo is back.
<Sheena> wb Kipi
<RedDragonX> well she and Stormy have been on here for a long time
<Nick> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=266 O_____O;;;;;;;;;;
<RedDragonX> they always back each other up most of the time
<gerpie> 7i know
<Kipikipo> tysamcns
<RedDragonX> but arguing about it with them will only infuriate their beliefs more
<gerpie> 7stormy is a christian to
<Kipikipo> tyaamcns*
<RedDragonX> So I have basically said screw it...because what does it really matter in the end. Whatever god is out there or whatever religion their is...if you abide by the traditions of all of them and live your life the way you want to lead it...you will be rewarded in the end no matter what
<Andyman> Sheena, are you obsessed with that song or something?
<Kipikipo> Why not?
<Sheena> not really obsessed...
<gerpie> 7i beleave that if you love God more then yourself and any1 else he will gife you a new hearth and so you will go to Heaven
<Sheena> It's just an awesome song...
<RedDragonX> well
<RedDragonX> it's whatever you believe man
<RedDragonX> and nobody is in any position to tell you otherwise
<RedDragonX> everyone has their beliefs
<RedDragonX> and that's how they want to see it and that's that

<Sheena> hi Feather
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14Wb Feather
<Feather> 10GUESS WHAT GUYS.
<Midnight> 12WOT?
<Feather> 10THAT VIRUS IS GONE.
<Feather> 10:D

<Feather> 10I still had a bit of it left
<Toxicroak> Secret code
<Avis> :D
<Feather> 10but I got rid of it XD
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14Congrats! :D
*Feather slaps Prince-Dari around a bit with a large trout
<Tear_Grants> Feather alert
<Quanyails> 7What was the virus?
<Midnight> 12Imma go now
<Feather> 10Trojan Horse
*Hawkie is here but might be idle
<Midnight> 12*runs off to watch Cloverfield and POOFS*
<Toxicroak> Problem is it's almost imossible to figure out
<Quanyails> 7No, what was the name of the virus, not the type
<Toxicroak> As you need to find what colors each are for
<Feather> 10O_O
<Feather> 10wow
<Quanyails> 7FEATHER:
<Sheena> whoa!
<Sheena> I only had like 30!
<Feather> 10WHAT?
<Quanyails> 7What was the name of the virus? (Not the type)
<Quanyails> 7Hyperbole, everyone.
<Feather> 10Err
<Quanyails> 7Either that, or the computer is used for testing purposes.
<Feather> 10I don't remember
<Quanyails> 7Or some virus that makes other viruses acess them.
<Toxicroak> In that case it was hot-pink then indigo which then you take the first letter of each and combine to find "Hi"
<Feather> 10GET KASPERSKY
<Feather> 10saved my computer :D
<Quanyails> 7I had CnsMin on a computer once
<Quanyails> 7I could not remove it whatsoever, so I had to deal with it until I got a new computer. :3
<Feather> 10AVG is good too.
<Toxicroak> Kaspersky has a free online scanner
<Tear_Grants> AVG is slow nowadays
<Sheena> dinner
<Sheena> brb
<Tear_Grants> Okay, Sheena
<Feather> 10k
<Tear_Grants> AVG used to be a lot better. I use avast! now.
<Quanyails> 7Brb
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14ok
<Quanyails|AFK> 7BTW: I use Ad-aware for Antivirus. *random*
<Toxicroak> ..I thoughtyou said Ad-ware
<Toxicroak> XD
<Feather> 10I use Ad-Aware, AVG Anti-Virus, and Kaspersky Anti-Virus.
<Toxicroak> That would be like total fail
<Tear_Grants> I have Ad-Aware but I rarely use it anymore since it's also slow
<Feather> 10?
<Toxicroak> ....KILLER POLL
<Feather> 10o_O
<Tear_Grants> Yeah I've heard that they recognize the other as a virus
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14Some scanners do that
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14AVG and NORTON for example
<Feather> 10Ehh, I'm not keeping Kaspersky
<Feather> 10only until I know 100% my virus is gone
<Feather> 10then I'll trust AVG to stop viruses
<Tear_Grants> New episode is up! ^_^
<Toxicroak> WHISCASH
<Feather> 10.
<J-Lugia> How many people here likes the donkey kong games?
<LugiaLordOfThePickles> 14I haven't had one virus from BT yet ;P
<Toxicroak> I dislike how forgotten Remoraid is
<Toxicroak> I mean it starts with a name of a band
<Toxicroak> R.E.M
<Toxicroak> How can someone forget a pokemon that starts with the name of band?
<Toxicroak> A band*
<Tear_Grants> Remoraid needs more attention, as does Octillery
<Tear_Grants> The water gym leader in my fanfic has an Octillery
<Toxicroak> Octillery confuses me still to this day
<Toxicroak> It should of been a whale shark
<Toxicroak> But eh
<Toxicroak> Whale sharks can fire fish out of their mouths like a cannon too
<Tear_Grants> Remoraid and Octillery have very little resemblance
<Toxicroak> And they get covered in Remoras
<Sheena_Dinner> mmmmm..........soup................................
<Toxicroak> More to the point we need a oarfish and a sturgeon poke
<Tear_Grants> welcome back Sheena
<Toxicroak> Whiscash evo should be a oarfish
<Toxicroak> Since oarfish known as EARTHQUAKE fish
<Toxicroak> o.o
<Toxicroak> are known*
<Sheena> O_o;
<Toxicroak> And it fits barboach
<Toxicroak> Since they have a similar shape
<Toxicroak> Just not really whiscash
<Tear_Grants> Okay

<Spyrorocks> [19:45] WARREN: Ignitus falls through the ring of fire and dies in the most anticlimatic fasion
<Spyrorocks> [19:45] WARREN: spyro argues with cynder about wether or not to save him
<Spyrorocks> [19:45] WARREN: in the end they cant stop the golem
<Mika> zomg
<Mika> these are too cute
<Mika> ;-;
<Mika> http://www.giantmicrobes.com/
<Spyrorocks> [19:46] WARREN: so they move on and try and kill malefor (somehow killing him stops the process)
<Spyrorocks> [19:47] WARREN: during the fight, Malefor speaks about how he and spyro are alike (both wanted to help people), how cynder is still under his controll, you know... the bad guy stuff
<Spyrorocks> [19:47] WARREN: in the end they cant kill him
<Spyrorocks> [19:47] WARREN: so a bunch of "dragon sprits" push him int lava
<pineapple> I've seen them before in the one catalog(Sp?) my bro gets
<Spyrorocks> "yeah, so I guess I cant kill him, so ill go summon some spirits to do it for me which I should have done at the start of the series in order to avoid all this crap."
<Spyrorocks> [19:48] WARREN: its too late, the ring of fire was completed. Spyro tells cynder to leave as he trys to stop the golem
<Spyrorocks> [19:48] WARREN: you see cynder run away and a firey explosin in the distance
<Spyrorocks> [19:49] WARREN: after the credits Ignitus is the new cronicler. He looks up Spyros name and finds out he isnt dead
<Spyrorocks> [19:49] WARREN: YOu see an extro of Spyro and cynder flying off into the sunset
<Sheena> wb eXAKR
<pineapple> WOULD YOU LIKE A PINEAPPLE *tuna'd and killed*
<Spyrorocks> guess so
<Sheena> *drool* pineapple...........

<Spyrorocks> thats what they should have done
<Spyrorocks> killed them both off
<Spyrorocks> thats unpredictable.
<Spyrorocks> but its defiantly the end of the LoS series.
<Kipikipo> '-'
<Spyrorocks> yeah, true
*Quilava nibbles Kipi
<Spyrorocks> "yeah, well, I can't beat this guy, so ill go summon some spirits to do it for me, which I could have done at the start of the series to avoid all this crap."
*Kipikipo pawbaps Quil's nose.

<Kjakings> 7Hey Aicebo, if we drive hail off the internet with constant trolling does the new policy go away, since it was /her/ stupidity that forced the network staff to make it
<Kjakings> 7Dari. No-one cares
<Deathbat> 10
<Aicebo> 13No, because apparently it's MY FAULT even though I didn't even say anything that bad, she asked a question about something, I answered it, then she replied a message that created the new policy
<Aicebo> 13I didn't even do anything.
<Deathbat> 10What policy? <_>
<Aicebo> 13):
<Deathbat> 10I am ignorant :D
<Kjakings> 7... Give me the full story. Go on my channel, BlueFusion's on there.

<Altair> cya Xel-
<Hail> 12Usually "spoiled bitches" are only child.
<Altair> >___>
<Hail> 12*are the only ONE child.
*Kjakings 7is setting up the targetting missiles for Yahoo's house. "PURIFICATION BY ANHIALATION!"
<Hail> 12One child in a family no...
<Deathbat> 10LOL!!!!!!!!
<Hail> 12I have 1 older sister and one younger brother.
<Hail> 12Imah in the middle.
<Deathbat> 10Hail: Aicebo didnt even call you a bitch.
<Hail> 12 8month year old-9 year old-17 year old
<Aicebo> 13Hail: Yes, notice how it's USUALLY. not always. You seem to get your way alot and don't like hearing anything against one of your opinions.
<Deathbat> 10or did she? *scrollz_up*
<Aicebo> 13Deathbat: I didn't, I just said "spoiled a bit".
<Hail> 12oh

*Hail 12runs to get her gingerale 8DDDDD
<Kjakings> 7 17:06	Hail	thought you meant"shes a spoiled bitch* No, mods aren't allowed to swear, she has to set the example. /Im/ the one who gets the job (and does it happily) of calling you a spoiled, retarded bitch who no-one likes and /always/ has to get her way, completely ignoring everyone else's opinions just to get whatever she wants and when anyone's not paying EVERY OUNCE of attention to you you have to think up some /sad/
<Kjakings> 7Wow. I bet that got cut off.
<Aicebo> 13It stopped at /sad/
<Aicebo> 13Anyways, I do swear sometimes
<J-Lugia> 2 minutes and 39 seconds seems long enough to me.
<Hail> 12Gingerale tastes good
<Kjakings> 7Oh, didn't cut off much
<Aicebo> 13I think I should get to be a little more strict but I don't mind a swear or two, I don't see the huge deal
<Kjakings> 7think up some /sad/ story about how your parents are fighting or you hurt your baby brother
<Hawkie> 07[18:04:57] <Xelig00n> gtg cya <- :(

<gerpie> yahoo hwat? o-o
<gerpie> what*
<Kjakings> 7Yahoo, I'm NOT going to tell you this again. This was NOT your fault. How could it POSSIBLY be your fault? Yes, you brought a /friend/ here who then got a PM from /someone_else/ asking for sex and then /SR_the_admin/ spread the PMs around, and then /Doppel/ went mad, which started all this. From that line of events I don't really see how it could be your fault.
<Yahoo> But I do admit, how was it Rd12's fault anyway? (that what she says) She doesnt know why she got in trouble, it was antr asking her and she did say no
<Hail> 12ok.
<Hail> 12What happened while I was gone?

<Hail> 12Yahoo...
<Hail> 12Yahoo...
<Hail> 12Yahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo....
<Aicebo> 13We used to have a happy community like we were a family on another site, and Neon was also one of them. These two guys, GC and Nachoz come along to an owl site and talk all about videogames. They are told repetitively by moderators to post more than videogames and to not post about them anymore. (like the RPs) they get pissed. They get threatened. They get banned. (I'm not done yet this is only the beginning)
<Hail> 12Rurik rurik rurik. Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurik.

<Hail> 12GOOD MORNING EVERYONE & EPSICIALLY YAHOO.
<Hail> 12Ohhhkay aicebo.
<Yahoo> Thank you Xp
<Hail> 12yeah.
<Hail> 12Mhm.
<Cynder7> 6Nuu
<Aicebo> 13So of course they threaten to come "spam and hack" the site (when they secretly can't do anything at all). That started an e-war. Fer serious. We had a "Parliament" of people from the site (me and Neon the owners,( Edina made an admin soon after) all the mods joined the site and we discussed their sites and our plans to trick them to find out truths. And next is a part that makes Ayumi "RL".
<Cynder7> 6I got a goodm orning!
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Rurik> 4Aicebo, your making my laugh too hard
<Rurik> 4stop :D
<Cynder7> 6Gah
<Cynder7> 6brb
<Cynder7> 6I ish hungry
<Yahoo> I'm getting a working tablet soon =3
<Cynder7> 6Back
<Yahoo> A Bamboo
<Aicebo> 13"RL" was really the guy "Nachoz". He came and rejoined the site and had a SAAAAD SAAAAAD made up story to win everyone over to be his friend and feel sorry for him. We eventually found out who he was when they spam attacked and they had matching IPs. He kept claiming he wasn't, so we wanted to find out the truth. We invited more members to our Parliament. We did literally like months of searching things and finding what makes them angry,
<Aicebo> 13(Did that get cut off)
<Rurik> 4what cut off
*Cynder7 6eats tastyness
<Aicebo> 13the paragraph
<Aicebo> 13xP
<Rurik> 4I got the huge wall of text
<Rurik> 4nothing else
<Aicebo> 13All 4 lines?
<Rurik> 4yeah
<Aicebo> 13ok..
<Yahoo> angry, cut there
<Cynder7> 6Same
<Yahoo> Or was that a typo?
<Aicebo> 13Eventually we found out the truth. RL just hated to like us. (Another Ayumi relation)
<Aicebo> 13Angry?
<gerpie> ;\
<Yahoo> and finding what makes them angry,
<Aicebo> 13getting to their sites, and that started the GC/RL e-war. What makes GC Doppel is that he laid back when RL had rejoined the site. (Not done yet)
<Cynder7> 6ya
<Aicebo> 13xP
<gerpie> and finding what makes them angry <----- nothinggg
<Aicebo> 13Because he rejoined AGAIN.
<Rurik> 4this is why I choose to never RP again with people who I don't know
<Aicebo> 13He just couldn't stay away
<Aicebo> 13Relations much?
<Aicebo> 13That's why Neon and I think this is so funny
<Aicebo> 13It's like the complete thing all over again
<Kjakings> 7I was originally gunna come back and yell "WHOO HOTDOGS!" but now I think it's not really in the mood
<Aicebo> 13It lasted around 7-9 months children, so be prepared.
<Cynder7> 6Lol
<Rurik> 4kek
<Rurik> 4really?
<Rurik> 4did you just IP ban them?
<Yahoo> STILL not loading anything on dA :/
<Hail> 12LOLOL
<Aicebo> 13Rurik: Not the first couple times...but we did now I think
<Rurik> 4lol
<Aicebo> 13I'm still half-buddies with RL...so...
<Aicebo> 13Neon is too
<Aicebo> 13Now that it ended
<Aicebo> 13They just "Can't step into our boundaries!"
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Aicebo> 13:P:P:P
<Rurik> 4 Igive it a month
<Kjakings> 7I'm still pissed at Neon for joining Bookie
<Cynder7> 6...
<Aicebo> 13He didn't join him...
<Aicebo> 13He just gave up...
<Aicebo> 13I wish Bookie was banned though
<Kjakings> 7And tried to stop it. In my book that's switching sides
<Cynder7> 6What's Bookie?
<Aicebo> 13All he does is blab about how great his site is to no one who gives a shit while he thinks he's the coolest in the world.

<Kjakings> 7I don't have a save, I keep forgetting to save it
<Stormy> I wanted to buy my brother one, but couldn't afford new ones and couldn't find a good deal on eBay.
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: dont you have a ds?
<Stormy> Yeah, a DS phat.
<Spyrorocks> I have the old ds phat
<Stormy> :P
<Kjakings> 7Oh?
<Spyrorocks> I dont know where it is though
<Kjakings> 7The save files don't use passwords, it's just 'load game' 'game loaded' thing
<Aicebo> 13I have the original one, you mean the fatter one?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Kjakings> 7Dari: For the DSI, apparently, you can't use GBA games /or/ the old DS games. Apparently.
<Kjakings> 7Yes alright alright.
<Aicebo> 13Me step uncle's daugther got a DSLite for Christmas
<Spyrorocks> You can buy the japenese dsi.
<Aicebo> 13her brother got a PSP
<Stormy> DSI looks pretty cool, but I still need the GBA slot.
<Spyrorocks> dsi is coming in the summer.
<Kjakings> 7Tell me American people: Is the DSI out in america yet?
<Spyrorocks> to north america.
<Stormy> I don't think so.
<Stormy> Not that I'm paying much attention
<Spyrorocks> Its not really something id buy
<Spyrorocks> what, i think it has like 2 cameras or something.
<Spyrorocks> what else is new?
<Spyrorocks> everything has a camera
<Spyrorocks> meebo.com
<Kjakings> 7All I want is inf health/ammo/money. I wanna complete the game myself
<Spyrorocks> sounds like my archos 5.
<Spyrorocks> Multi touch gestures are patented by apple
<Kjakings> 7Cheers
<Spyrorocks> thats why no other devices can have thing like the pinch zooming like the iphone
<Spyrorocks> I dont think ill buy one.
<Rurik> 4DSI?
<Rurik> 4O rly?
<Spyrorocks> everything has internet browser now, its really not that special.
<Rurik> 4I loved my DS
<Spyrorocks> they need to add something totally different.
<Rurik> 4Till I lost it
<Spyrorocks> Rurik: Because U tarded?
<Spyrorocks> hahahaha I couldn't resist
<Stormy> Even the old DS had an internet browser; you just had to buy it separately.
<Stormy> Hahaha what? XD
<Spyrorocks> I dont know, all I know is 2 cameras and an internet browser doesn't interest me.
<Rurik> 4brb
<Stormy> 2 cameras?
<Stormy> Why would it need 2?
<Spyrorocks> Ill be buying a blackberry storm, so I can have msn/irc/ everything where ever i go, not limited to wifi.
<Spyrorocks> How much is the DSI going to cost?
<Spyrorocks> $300?
<Spyrorocks> $250?
<Stormy> I need a new cell phone.
<Stormy> My razr got washed in the washing machine, and some of the buttons don't work now.
<Spyrorocks> Stormy: yeah you washed it in the washing machine, right?
<Stormy> Yep.
<Stormy> Actually it was Evan who washed it, so I blame him. :P
<Spyrorocks> you can buy a new cellphone for like $50 then stick your old sim card in it.
<Spyrorocks> ouch
<Spyrorocks> unlocked blackberry storm $1200 CND
<Spyrorocks> rip off
<Stormy> That's what we were thinking, but we found out that that company doesn't use sim cards.
<Spyrorocks> everyone uses sim cards, they are like universal
<Spyrorocks> who were you with?
<Stormy> Verizon
<Spyrorocks> were you on a contract or pay as you go?
<Spyrorocks> verizon is sim cards
<Stormy> I have no idea; I don't pay for the plan. :P
<Stormy> We looked it up online and they said they don't.
<Spyrorocks> If i want anything I always need to pay for it myself...
<Stormy> My dad moved the service back down to my old phone.
<Spyrorocks> Your right, it doesnt have sim cards.
<Stormy> My parents never asked me to pay, and I'm not exactly going to ask them to let me.
<Spyrorocks> Canadian cellphone plans are more expensive then anywhere else in the word.
<Stormy> :P
<Spyrorocks> world*
<Rurik> 4:O
<Spyrorocks> its starting to get better, slowly.
<Spyrorocks> too many monopolies.
<Rurik> 4I hate that game
<Spyrorocks> I love monopoly.
<RedDragonX> too long
<Spyrorocks> My brother steals from the bank though.
<Rurik> 4lol
<Spyrorocks> I haven't played it for like... over 2 years.
<Stormy> I think the last time I played Monopoly was when I played Monopoly Junior when I was a kid. :P
<Spyrorocks> Me and my grandma used to play the vancouver monopoly.
<Rurik> 4GO TEAM VENTURE!
<Stormy> We never play board games because my sister complains when she loses.
<Stormy> -___-
<Spyrorocks> My brothers have too much energy for playing board games, so it always turns out bad with all the pieces going all over.
<gerpie> meh
<Stormy> Hahah
<Rurik> 4I get bored with board games
<gerpie> Red! ;D
<gerpie> stormy! ;D

<Rurik> 4:P
<RedDragonX> I was the first to ever do it apparently lol
<RedDragonX> I owned at golf though lol
<Spyrorocks> golf takes to long to play
<Rurik> 4I just swing
<RedDragonX> well playing it in rl gives you that patience lol
<Rurik> 4see what happens from there
<RedDragonX> but yeah I think tennis was my favorite
<Kjakings> 7I once managed to hit the ball behind me o_O
<Stormy> She's like, "oh boohoohoo, why isn't it working?!" Then someone tries to help her and she says "Stop yelling at me!!!"
<Stormy> Then of course my parents come running to her rescue.
<Rurik> 4IGNORE ME!
<RedDragonX> I did that too lol
<Spyrorocks> How old is your sister?
<Spyrorocks> 11?
<Stormy> 11
<Stormy> Yeah
<Spyrorocks> thought so.
<Aicebo> 13lol.
<Spyrorocks> My sister doesn't whine like that and shes 11.
<Kjakings> 7I bet SR stalks stormy lol
<Spyrorocks> Im sure Aicebo does though.
<gerpie> 10so red sup? ;]
<Rurik> 4Yeah
<Rurik> 4she does
<Kjakings> 7 21:42	Spyrorocks	How old is your sister? 21:42	Spyrorocks	11? 21:42	Stormy	11 21:42	Stormy	Yeah 21:42	Spyrorocks	thought so.
<Stormy> She's the youngest, so she always gets her way.
<RedDragonX> not much gerp. Just got home from work
<Stormy> Probably has something to do with it.
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo does a lot. :P
<gerpie> 10o-o
<Spyrorocks> same with my little brainwashed miley cyrus lover sister.
<Stormy> Bahaha, speaking of Miley Cyrus
<Spyrorocks> shes like 6 and copies whatever she sees on tv.
<Aicebo> 13I don't whine :P
<Rurik> 4My cousin is obbsessed with her and Twilight
<Stormy> On that email you sent me, one of the adds said
<Stormy> Miley Cyrus' IQ = 124
<Stormy> Are You Smarter Than Miley Cyrus? Take The Real IQ Test Now!
<Stormy> www.Celeb-IQ-Quizzes.com
*Kjakings 7sets the nukes to SR's location, hoping he is within a 5 mile radius of his sister. "Purification by anhialation."
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Stormy> Wow, I really care!
<Kjakings> 7:P
<Spyrorocks> I told my sister Miley posed half naked for a magazine and she didn't know what to say. Now she probably wants to pose half nude for a magazine or something.
<gerpie> 10so musch guys on T_T
<Stormy> I'm so glad my sister isn't into that junk.
<Kjakings> 7How goes teh haxx I can use? :P
<Aicebo> 13ANYONE is smarter than Miley and her obsessers.
<RedDragonX> yeah I just kinda watch lol
<Stormy> My brother and I made fun of it too much, I guess.
<Stormy> We saved her.
<Stormy> :P
<Spyrorocks> I make fun of her all the time
<Spyrorocks> she still likes that garbage.
<Rurik> 4I tend to ignore her
<Spyrorocks> all of her songs have to do with a boyfriend, either in a positive or negative sense.
<Rurik> 4that's every song out there
<Rurik> 4'Sex, boyfriends/girlfriends, everone hates me...'
<Spyrorocks> disney writes all her songs, one of which talks about how she has everything she always wanted.
<Stormy> Yeah, and does she realize her main audience is 5-12 year olds?
<Kjakings> 7Ey ey Scotty.
<Spyrorocks> "look at me im a spoiled brat who has a bunch of kids who wear diapers follow me"
<Stormy> 5-12-year-olds who now probably think they need to have a boyfriend just like Miley.
<Spyrorocks> Yep
<Stormy> I don't see how little kids can like it.
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Kjakings> 7Wow. This is probably the /one/ thing all of the Spyrochat Regulars agree upon.
<Aicebo> 13Same
<Hail> 11back
<Hail> 11back
<Stormy> I always tell them they may want to be a teenager now, but when they finally get to be 13, they won't want to anymore.
<Kjakings> 7Does Hail count as a Regular? She's not been for ages
<Aicebo> 13I feel REALLY bad for this one girl who always calls me and eats chips into the phone.
<Rurik> 4gah
<Rurik> 4I agree Stormy
*Hail 11scrolls up and reads since sh lef
<Aicebo> 13Her: "Ugh the kindergardeners were singing High School Musical today, I'm thinking should they really be listening to that at such a young age!?!?!"
<Aicebo> 13I was like LOL
<Aicebo> 13LOLOLOLOL
<Hail> 11tshe left.
<Spyrorocks> Yeah, id just like to skip the whole thing and go right to age 20.
<Aicebo> 13HOW STUPID OF YOU
<Rurik> 4Though I'd rather not be 18
<Aicebo> 13I said "It was meant for kindergardeners, you know..." She's like "NOOO IT'S NOT KRSDN Jgtrhvlytdhkbkjfdd"
<Aicebo> 13Hahahahaha
<RedDragonX> hm
<Spyrorocks> and when im 20 I can start work on my time machine to go back to age 10 and tell everyone at school they are idiots for giving into dumb fads.
<Rurik> 4lol
<Kjakings> 7kindergartenners* It's german with a T nor a D, in America too, especially since England doesn't /have/ kindergarten
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Spyrorocks> kindergarden is a sham
<Kjakings> 7garten, kinderGARTEN
<Rurik> 4It's school: it sucks
<Kjakings> 7:P
<RedDragonX> yay I'm the only one who is 20...damn
<Aicebo> 13Nursery = preschool
<Aicebo> 13lol.
<Aicebo> 13Not here.
<Spyrorocks> RedDragonX: Going to start work on YOUR time machine?
<Aicebo> 13Preschool is optional
<Kjakings> 7Yes, KindergarTen (NOTICE TEH T) = preschool also, now then children, what did we learn today?
<Aicebo> 13Preschool, Kindergarden, then grades
<RedDragonX> You know man if I was a math genious I would prolly do so lol
<RedDragonX> but I can always dream
<Rurik> 4I'd be too lazy when I hit 20
<Spyrorocks> haha I suck at maths.
<RedDragonX> join the club
<Rurik> 4I hate math
<Rurik> 4but I am good at it
<Stormy> I like math.... =P
<Spyrorocks> I can program and do math on a computer, but I hate it when its on paper.
<Stormy> Hey!
<RedDragonX> eh I'm just a history guy...that's it..
<Stormy> XD
<Spyrorocks> I hate writing as well.
<Stormy> Prince-dari and I agreed on something? Amazing....
<RedDragonX> lol
<Kjakings> 7When you guys finish your time machines, give me the schematics so I can create /my/ time machine and then go back and steal yours, giving it to the myself of the past and creating a Temporal Paradox that hopefully destroys the Universe or just saves a lot of work for me. Win-win.
<RedDragonX> well you took your time with that lol
<Hail> 11Oh, I used to hate preschool when, I was little.
<Aicebo> 13lol.
<Stormy> :P
<Hail> 11Haha, my mom told me stories.
<Hail> 11Lawl.
<Aicebo> 13I went to a preschool kinda far away from me.
<Hail> 11=p
<Aicebo> 13I liked my preschool
<Kjakings> 7That's probably because they told Hail that she could /not/ steal everyone elses food and she got stressy not having her own way
<Hail> 11Want to hear one
<Aicebo> 13My step uncle's daughter and I are the same age and we went to the same preschool
<Spyrorocks> ever watch the terminator 1?
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: LOL
<RedDragonX> I love that movie
<Spyrorocks> Thats some crazy time paradox going on in there
<RedDragonX> new one comes out this summer I think
<Kjakings> 7I've seen Terminator 2, just not 1, 3, or the Sarah O'Connor Chronicles (the T.V. show)
<Spyrorocks> His father is his friend who went back in time and got it on with his mom...
<Rurik> 4I've seen bits and peices for it
<Aicebo> 13.....................
<RedDragonX> yeaaah
<Aicebo> 13lol
<Spyrorocks> It hurts your head thinking about it
<RedDragonX> certainly interesting
<RedDragonX> and it keeps going around and around @.@
<Hail> 11No, because I pee'd my pants once in preschool, and my mom told me that everyone was just staring at me and then I had to go to the "nurse" and borrow clothes from her. Then I had to bring the wet ones home in a bag. On the bus, I got made fun of.
<Spyrorocks> yeah , its never ending
<RedDragonX> yup
<RedDragonX> I'll stick to simple stuff lol
<Spyrorocks> In the future, John sends his friend back in time to look after his mother
<RedDragonX> and he gets it on with her lol
<Kjakings> 7I like the brain-melting feeling of temporal paradoxes.
<RedDragonX> and John KNOWS it lol
<Rurik> 4Gah, Hail's text burns my eyes
<Spyrorocks> then, his friend becomes his father
<Aicebo> 13Who the hell takes a bus to preschool...
<Hail> 11And once I ended up cursing in 2nd grade at a boy on my bus because he called me a "modder fawcker" because he heard his mom & dad saying it.
<Aicebo> 13lol...
<Spyrorocks> but that leaves the question, how did john exist when its him who told his friend to go back in time?
<Hail> 11 I did.
<RedDragonX> I know lol
<Hail> 11I little preschool bus.
<RedDragonX> I have thought about it too
<Hail> 11:B
<Spyrorocks> confusing.
<RedDragonX> I gave up after awhile lol
<Hail> 11And once I ended up cursing in 2nd grade at a boy on my bus because he called me a "modder fawcker" because he heard his mom & dad saying it.
<Spyrorocks> I'm not even going to think about it
<Spyrorocks> because logically it cant work
<Hail> 11he pronounced it like that.
<Kjakings> 7My favourite temporal paradox: Killing your own grandmother
<RedDragonX> eh just enjoy the mind melting entertainment of cinema..the way it is suppose to be lol
<Aicebo> 13In my preschool we only had to go there 2 or 3 times a week...it ruled.
<RedDragonX> yeah but how was John there to tell him to begin with lol
<Spyrorocks> Prince-Dari: exactly, but he needed to exist to tell his friend to go back in time
<RedDragonX> @.@
<Spyrorocks> and he can't exist without his friend going back in time
<Hail> 11We had to go 6 days straight.
<Spyrorocks> but he needed to tell him to go back in time.
<Hail> 11Even on fucking Satrday.
<Hail> 11*Saturday
<SpyroBot> 1,8New Topic Alert:2 "Drawing Contest" by Mysterious Cynder, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8306
<Spyrorocks> Nope, logically he shouldn't exist because he is the reason he was born.
<Rurik> 4lol
<RedDragonX> yup
<Rurik> 4That's what Spyrobot is for
<Aicebo> 13Yup
<RedDragonX> how did his "dad" know to go back in time to get it on with his mom without John being in the future to begin with
<Spyrorocks> But different fathers would mean different personality most likley.
<Hail> 11Nowadays, I go to school, 5 days a week.
<Rurik> 4I thought that it was some bot that SR put there so he can have a mock compitiotion over the chat :P
<gerpie> 10meh
<gerpie> 10im bored
<Hail> 11Off on Sat. and Sun..
<Spyrorocks> and it would change the events that lead up to him telling his friend to go back in time
<RedDragonX> and around and around we go
<Hail> 11I'm in the fourth grade because Im nine.
<Spyrorocks> It doesn't make sense.
<Spyrorocks> It keeps on going around and arong.
<RedDragonX> yup
<Spyrorocks> My brother in 9 as well.
<RedDragonX> how
<RedDragonX> if he didn't know to go back
<RedDragonX> what motivation would he have
<Rurik> 4My brother is 10
<Rurik> 4but Autistic
<Aicebo> 13I never go to school......
<Aicebo> 13YEY.
<Spyrorocks> John was the one who told his friend about his mother and how she needed to be protected from the terminator.
<RedDragonX> yeah...so he was the only one who would know
<RedDragonX> if someone else was there before them...then that would make no John to begin with
<Stormy> What is this movie?
<Spyrorocks> the only way he would know about johns mother is because john gave him a picture of her.
<Stormy> Remind me never to watch it.
<RedDragonX> The Terminator
<Aicebo> 13Stormy: Terminator
<Kjakings> 7OR, we all stop debating about temporal paradoxes in an imaginary universe in which the crappest actor in the world wasan integral part
<RedDragonX> it's a good movie lol...just don't think too much about it lol
<Kjakings> 7was an*
<Kjakings> 7Bloody stiff keyboard
<Spyrorocks> Arnold is awesome.
<RedDragonX> hey I thought it was his best role lol...everything after that suckd though lol
<Rurik> 4I am so lost
<Kjakings> 7Arnold sucks
<RedDragonX> He was built for that kinda role lol..everything else didn't really settle
<Spyrorocks> too bad hes Governor now, cant do any new movies.

<Stormy> Ya know, Kjakings, she has a point.
<Stormy> Uhh, yeah you are.
<RedDragonX> lol
<Kjakings> 7... True

<RedDragonX> I fogot just how unrealistic this movie is
<Hail> 11Kjakings, stop trying to get people to laugh at you because you got owned by my "point".
<Spyrorocks> Hail, you got a point in, don't try to drag it on.
<Spyrorocks> Take what you got.
<gerpie> 10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9soWP6LDHNw&feature=channel_page X]
<Kjakings> 7Yeah, quit while you're ahead. You'll never have the advantage again.
<RedDragonX> lol
<Hail> 11Well, you know he does this crap on purpose, a lot.
<Kjakings> 7There's some crime-watch-esque thing on T.V. and when I looked at it I thought "HOLY SHIZZLE ZOMBEHZ!", then I realised it was a fight with a crowd
<Kjakings> 7In my defence, it was black and white (and mostly grey) and out of focus
<Kjakings> 7-silence?-
<Hail> 11Zombies are not real though, how do you see them then?....

<Hail> 11:O That was entertaining.
<Kjakings> 7I /thought/ it was zombies. I was playing Left 4 Dead for like 2 hours earlier.
<Spyrorocks> CSI is ok, but its too fake.
<Kjakings> 7Which is a "Here is your gun. Here are some zombies. HAVE FUN!" game
<Kjakings> 7...? ^
<Rurik> 4lol
<Hail> 3Samantha Picklez?!
<Rurik> 4I still like the Zero Punctuation review

<Aicebo> 13RL got so mad over not talking about videogames in one topic (like Ayumi with the RPGs), made up a sad story when he rejoined to make everyone try to feel sorry for him (like Ayumi), and we had like a mini e-war that lasted a few months, and he's all like I'm sorry just let me be on the site (like Ayumi) he hates to like us but he can't stay away.
<Spyro360> i love rpgs
<Hail> 11I have a brand new color too.
<Hail> 11=)

<Aicebo> 13threatening to "hack" the site
<Aicebo> 13Yeah I told them that
<EM99> Kewl.
<EM99> That was so fun.
<EM99> We pwn'd them so hard.
<Aicebo> 13What wasn't fun was that NPL was sharing information with them...T__T
<EM99> And dissing me...
<EM99> And to think we found that 10 months later.
<EM99> XD
<Aicebo> 13SHE'S probably the one who gave them the address I bet

<Aicebo> 13You should've kept everything in an unreadable archive
<EM99> I wish i did.
<Aicebo> 13I wanna go over that old stuff and show what a fraud NPL was
<EM99> But I had to be all obnoxious and delete everything.
<EM99> -__-

<EM99> Eleven stones cannot rtemain unhidden.
<EM99> Then dancers will only bid more than expected.
<RedDragonX> LMAO
<EM99> Sever the head of the snake and the body dies.
<RedDragonX> I'm sorry for wasting the time of whoever reads this?
<EM99> Finality is not without sense of irony.
<EM99> *Fate
<Rurik> 4wasted my time
<RedDragonX> you're telling me
<RedDragonX> what has the average reviewer come too these days
<EM99> Redos often end in a greater catastrophy.
<EM99> Don't eat the yellow snow.
<Rurik> 4Temped to just put up another notice saying 'STOP BUGGING ME'
<Rurik> 4whereas no one would listen and I would be wasting my time
<Hail> 11oooh

<RedDragonX> sometimes you have to go that far...which shows just how dumb it's getting
<EM99> In case of emergency, always have your towel at the ready.
<Aicebo> 13I guess Foxy wasn't so foxy after all.
<EM99> The bureaucracy is expaning to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.
<EM99> *expanding
<RedDragonX> well not after that
<Rurik> 4I mean, I enjoy reading reviews that I can reply to
<Rurik> 4so I can state my things on it
<EM99> When all is said and done, the couch is not comfort.
<EM99> Never relax before the end.
<EM99> Impossibilities are generally impossible.
<EM99> Common sense is not common.

<Rurik> 4exactly why I left that site and went to DA
<EM99> Sanity is a matter of opinion.
<Rurik> 4less views, but more readable comments
<Hail> 11Foxy, was a fox who lived ina magical box. He once got bloxed on DA and listened to the song bad day
<Aicebo> 13Hail: You're completely humorless.

<Spyrorocks> of course not, just difficult to move large amounts of money around from across the country, when you dont have a bank account.
<RedDragonX> yeah it isn't easy lol
<RedDragonX> I have too many accounts lol
<Spyrorocks> western union max is only like $2000
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> well needless to say the Navy takes pretty good care of it for me
<Spyrorocks> Im sure they do, you get paid as long as you are prepared to go?
<RedDragonX> I get paid for my drills yes
<RedDragonX> But I received a nice signing bonus that I continue to build upon
<Spyrorocks> how long are you enlisted?
<RedDragonX> 8 years
<Spyrorocks> woah thats pretty long
<RedDragonX> yeah
<RedDragonX> but most guys go 20
<RedDragonX> you get the nice pension if you go that long
<Spyrorocks> why did you do it?
<RedDragonX> I did it because I wanted to serve my country. And I wanted to make myself a better person
<Spyrorocks> I see
<RedDragonX> in high school
<RedDragonX> I wasn't exactly that nicest guy
<RedDragonX> made stupid mistakes...and I wanted to correct that
<Spyrorocks> Interesting.

<XRedDragonX> but yeah best thing I ever did to my life
<XRedDragonX> helped me put a lot of things back on track
<Spyrorocks> where do you see yourself in 15 years?
<XRedDragonX> I see myself in my own self built house with my family and living my days out being the best person I can be to those who deserve it
<Spyrorocks> Did you have that response in your head from being asked that question before?
<Blaze> 4well im back
<XRedDragonX> I know what I want in life man
<XRedDragonX> I have set myself on a goal and I want to reach it
<XRedDragonX> I will do everything I can to get there
<Spyrorocks> You seem pretty content.
<XRedDragonX> but the response varies depending on the day lol..but that's the general idea
<Blaze> 4geuss i wasnt brb!
<Spyrorocks> I have never talked to someone with a personality like yours on the internet before.
<XRedDragonX> Hi Blaze lol
<Blaze> 4hi
<XRedDragonX> well I'm not like the average guy I guess
<XRedDragonX> well I am lol
<Blaze> 4whatcha talking about?
<Spyrorocks> average is a horrible thing.
<XRedDragonX> but I am blessed with good traits that I do my best to employ
<XRedDragonX> and I try to pass them to everyone
<Blaze> 4whatcha talking about?
<XRedDragonX> especially my friends
<XRedDragonX> and we are talking about my personality Blaze lol
<Blaze> 4oh
<Blaze> 4my personality is...
<Blaze> 4hmmm
<Spyrorocks> I dont know where i see myself in 5 years, much less 15.
<XRedDragonX> well
<XRedDragonX> life is always changing man
<Blaze> 4how old are you?
<Spyrorocks> Things are about to change really fast with me.
<XRedDragonX> you never know what's gonna happen
<XRedDragonX> who are you asking Blaze
<Blaze> 4spyro
<Spyrorocks> The next few months is make or break.

<Blaze> 4omg im only 11
<XRedDragonX> but yeah man...I know that things will always be changing
<XRedDragonX> but I will do my best to live my live the way I want to live it
<Aicebo> What a shame ):
<XRedDragonX> and I try to help anyone who seeks the same in life
<Blaze> 4ok fourtiain cookie im out cya
<Spyrorocks> The last 6 months I have learned a LOT about online business, reached a few goals, now its time to see if I can surpass my expectations of myself.
<XRedDragonX> well only you know what to expect of yourself
<Blaze> 4FORTAIN COOKIE!!!!!
<XRedDragonX> you know your limits and your ability to adapt
<Blaze> 4sdfgsdfgs
<Aicebo> 13Blaze: Don't spam.
<XRedDragonX> and I'm not a freaking fortune cookie lol
<XRedDragonX> god
<Spyrorocks> Ever hear of the peter principal?
<Rurik> 4O-o
<XRedDragonX> explain it?
<Spyrorocks> "In a Hierarchy Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence."
<XRedDragonX> I've heard it before
<Spyrorocks> That is one of the most important things I have ever heard.
<XRedDragonX> pretty wise if I don't say so myself
<Spyrorocks> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle
<XRedDragonX> well just like losing your reason for putting faith into your work
<Blazingdragon> 4lol im like icy!!!
<XRedDragonX> you lose reason and you lose your motivation
<XRedDragonX> what do you become
<Blazingdragon> 4OMG YOUR A FREAKING FORTIAN COOKIE!!
<XRedDragonX> I would like to go as far as I can in this company
<Spyrorocks> Read the wiki page. Its very interesting.
<Aicebo> 13If you are going to spam, you will be kicked.
<XRedDragonX> but I don't want to go too high
<XRedDragonX> because my bosses
<XRedDragonX> they don't know the half about what we actually do sometimes
<XRedDragonX> they don't aways understand just what it's like on the frontlines
<Spyrorocks> If you go too high, you rise to incompetence because you no longer posses the skills to rise further.
<Blazingdragon> 4hey guys im like icydragon!!!!!
<Blazingdragon> 4ya know icy!
<XRedDragonX> pretty much
<XRedDragonX> I like where I am...but I will take my motivation and my desire to excell with me to whichever end
<Spyrorocks> If you stay where your skills apply in the company, you will always be competent.
<Blazingdragon> 4omg your soamming
<Blazingdragon> 4spamming*
<Aicebo> 13No...they aren't.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<XRedDragonX> very true...but I also wish to build upon myself...and I will work as hard as I can to find my own limitations...and continue to improve
<Aicebo> 13They're having an intelligent conversation.
<Spyrorocks> To rise above to a level where your skills don't apply will make you incompetent.
<XRedDragonX> and I have never lost my motivation and desire
<Blazingdragon> 0:D well there not listening that im like icy! its funneh!
<Spyrorocks> You cannot complete your tasks.
<Spyrorocks> It is different
<XRedDragonX> it's a good principle but I have seen exceptions
<Blazingdragon> 0were are they getting all this from?
<XRedDragonX> unles my fatigue if finanlly getting to my mind
<Spyrorocks> It is possible for everyone to rise too high for their own good.
<Blazingdragon> 0its driving me mad!!!
<XRedDragonX> it is
<XRedDragonX> but you still have to find that limit
<XRedDragonX> and understand your limitations
<Spyrorocks> exactly
<Blazingdragon> 0its like reading a fortain cookie!
<XRedDragonX> and we are getting this from our experiences and our reason blazingdragon
<XRedDragonX> and I'm not a damn fortune cookie
<Blazingdragon> 0yes you are
<Aicebo> 13Blazingdragon: They know what things are and can actually learn things....
<Spyrorocks> "The employee's incompetence is not necessarily exposed as a result of the higher-ranking position being more difficult  simply, that job is different from the job in which the employee previously excelled, and thus requires different work skills, which the employee usually does not possess. For example, a factory worker's excellence in his job can earn him promotion to manager, at which point the skills that earned him his promotion no
<Blazingdragon> 0n00b!
<Aicebo> 13Nobody here but you is a n00b, Blazingdragon.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<Spyrorocks> That paragraph outlines it pretty well.
<Blazingdragon> 0SIR N00BSALOT
<Spyrorocks> It does not state you cannot learn the skill.
<XRedDragonX> again a true statement...but is it also possible for an employee to go from something they are not so good at...or mediocre at...to something that they are amazing at?
<XRedDragonX> thank you Aicebo
<Aicebo> 13Ugh
<Aicebo> 13n0000000b.
<Aicebo> 13-___-
<XRedDragonX> lol
<Spyrorocks> Its just its impractical to jump into something that you cannot do to the best of your ability and remain an asset to the company.
<Spyrorocks> If you cannot preform the task, theres no point in taking it on until your skillset is developed to the point where you are able to preform it.
<Blazingdragon> 4...
<XRedDragonX> but you can only build the skill to employ it by experiencing it
<Blazingdragon> 0:/FORTAIN COOKIE!!!!!!:/
<Spyrorocks> By experiencing what you need to do, but fail to do, can build unneeded stress
<XRedDragonX> That's getting old blaze lol
<Spyrorocks> It usually toppels on itself
<Blazingdragon> 0kk ill shut up
<Spyrorocks> but it does differ person to person
<XRedDragonX> but depending on how you take that stress can really make the difference in your overall quality to the company
<Blazingdragon> 4well what now?
<XRedDragonX> for example...we have one employee who can't order his route and is extremely paranoid about his stock
<Spyrorocks> "at which point the skills that earned him his promotion no longer apply to his job."
<XRedDragonX> yes but others can still take that stress..and they need the attempt to discover the limits of their stress
<Blazingdragon> 4kk i cant stand little mister know it all fortain cookie over here so im out CYA LATER n00BS!!!
<XRedDragonX> and just how much they can deal with those situations
<Aicebo> 13Wow.
<Aicebo> 13Calling people smarter than him n00bs is so n00by.
<Aicebo> 13:P
<XRedDragonX> Fortune cookie
<XRedDragonX> I have never gotten that one before lol
<Aicebo> 13Learn how to spell fortune, too, chap. xP
<Aicebo> 13Gawsh
<Aicebo> 13Lol
<Spyrorocks> If someone is promoted to a new level that does not include the skills they needed to deserve the promotion in the first place, their skills are being wasted
<Spyrorocks> skills they already have
<Spyrorocks> and are developed
<Spyrorocks> although the flip side
<XRedDragonX> but if the skills don't apply to that new job they would have to learn it somehow
<Spyrorocks> is that they could be good at something they never knew they knew about before.
<XRedDragonX> that's the human ability to adapt and to adsorb
<XRedDragonX> and to learn more then what we have to build upon ourselves
<XRedDragonX> that's what a good employee does
<XRedDragonX> and yes too many forget that now and are caught in positions they can't handle
<Spyrorocks> But, is it practical to give someone a different job other than what you know they are good at?
<XRedDragonX> No it would not be...but it also works like the Navy for example
<XRedDragonX> the needs of the service
<XRedDragonX> it doesn't matter what your job is
<Spyrorocks> Its much better for the company to go hire someone who excels in that field.
<XRedDragonX> so long as you are qualified at it in some way or another you will fill it
<XRedDragonX> and behold the great trap to employers
<Spyrorocks> But then, loyalty comes into play
<Spyrorocks> theres a bunch of untouched sub-topics from the wiki page
<XRedDragonX> well one thing I can say for my company. They may not have the skills per say..but loyalty is pretty steady
<Spyrorocks> some of which we touched on.
<XRedDragonX> just a second...I gotta take my eyes out
<Spyrorocks> k
<Spyrorocks> need a spoon?
<XRedDragonX> lol
<XRedDragonX> not with contacts
<Spyrorocks> Im joking.
<XRedDragonX> I can try though lol
<XRedDragonX> yeah I know I'm just tired lol
<Spyrorocks> I meant like literally scoop your eyes out.
<XRedDragonX> I know man lol
<XRedDragonX> alright that's better
<XRedDragonX> things were starting to burn
<XRedDragonX> Loyalty to ones job will certainly help you build upon it...but it can also lead to your destruction. Such as one's ability to remain more loyal to once concept over another...
<XRedDragonX> such as when you're out in the market
<XRedDragonX> I can use myself as an example
<XRedDragonX> The other day I was in the local Price Chopper
<XRedDragonX> and my boss called me to let me know how the new display was being built
<XRedDragonX> the manager of the store then came up to me and told me to hang up the phone
<XRedDragonX> and that he wanted me to move some things out of the way
<XRedDragonX> to which I moved to the back of the store to continue the conversation with my boss on the phone
<XRedDragonX> my associate then came up to me to let me know that the manage was going to kick me out of the store if I didn't get off the phone
<XRedDragonX> "manager"
<Spyrorocks> Interesting...
<XRedDragonX> so I finished the conversation with my boss
<XRedDragonX> and went to the manager
<XRedDragonX> who promptly asked me why I didn't hang up the phone
<XRedDragonX> to which I responded "I don't hang up the phone on my superiors. Especially those I respect."
<XRedDragonX> he told me that "So long as you are in my store...I'm your boss...and you do what I tell you to do."
<XRedDragonX> to which in order to get him out of my face...I simply nodded and walked away
<XRedDragonX> but the concept for customer service in Coca-Cola is to present a good image to the customer
<XRedDragonX> and that the customer always comes first
<XRedDragonX> but to hang up the phone and deal with the manager would have portrayed a lack of respect towards my boss
<XRedDragonX> and in my mind I listen to those whom I am employed to do so
<XRedDragonX> and they are the ones who will always come first
<XRedDragonX> if you kick me out of yours store so be it...we have plenty of employees who can do my joh...and if not then your work doesn't get done at all
<XRedDragonX> to which that will pass a large amount of disrespect for our company
<XRedDragonX> it's a very delicate line to balance on
<Spyrorocks> Thats quite interesting
<XRedDragonX> but my loyalty lies with those who give me my employment
<XRedDragonX> and if they trust me like I try to trust them...they would understand my motivation
<XRedDragonX> and that's what I told my boss when he asked for a report on the incident
<XRedDragonX> needless to say I was given a better route soon afterwards
<Spyrorocks> I agree though that is a very fine line
<XRedDragonX> yes it is
<Spyrorocks> You dont want to disrespect the customer.
<Spyrorocks> But then again, you don't work for the customer.
<XRedDragonX> but at the same time not your own employer
<XRedDragonX> so where does the loyalty truly lie
<Spyrorocks> you have to figure out who's relationship you value more.
<XRedDragonX> well and that's what I told my boss
<XRedDragonX> I do everything I can for the customer
<XRedDragonX> and I never argue with them when their is no need for it
<XRedDragonX> but when someone demands that I hang up on my boss
<XRedDragonX> that crosses the line with me
<Spyrorocks> they are asking you to disrespect your employer,
<XRedDragonX> basically
<XRedDragonX> in order to satisfy their needs
<Spyrorocks> to disrespect your employer is worse to disrespect the customer. thats the bottom line.
<XRedDragonX> very
<Spyrorocks> Theres always more customers.
<XRedDragonX> my future rests in the hands of my employers
<XRedDragonX> and I do everything I can to bring them respect
<XRedDragonX> even if they don't deserve it
<Spyrorocks> One of my buddies works at walmart
<XRedDragonX> ehhh
<Spyrorocks> he told a customer to "f*** off"
<XRedDragonX> Not one of our best relationships
<Spyrorocks> surprisingly he was never fired.
<XRedDragonX> really?
<XRedDragonX> We have a big one in town....and I heard that someone was fired for being "To honest to the customer."
<Spyrorocks> That leaves the question, does the employer value an employee over a single customer?
<Spyrorocks> "too honest"....
<XRedDragonX> yeah sorry lol
<Spyrorocks> thats pretty bad.
<XRedDragonX> well
<XRedDragonX> Wal-Mart is a different deal
<Spyrorocks> althugh
<Spyrorocks> it is buisness.
<XRedDragonX> we call them Wally-World
<XRedDragonX> they live in their own little world
<XRedDragonX> but it is a pretty good example of the loyalty in our company
<Spyrorocks> The trick is to get a job where you are not disposable.
<XRedDragonX> then you do the most you can to better yourself at that job. The more use you are...what reason would they have to get rid of you
<Spyrorocks> either that, or do a damn good job.
<XRedDragonX> that's just how I approach my job
<XRedDragonX> much how I approach every aspect of my life
<XRedDragonX> I do everything I can to the best of my ability...and I seek to improve upon that
<XRedDragonX> and better myself to the point of my satisfaction
<Rurik> 4Speaking of jobs, I work at an electronic store and I basically don't speak unless I am spoken too
*Rurik 4disappears again

<Yahoo> Then I got shot by Erin..
<gerpie> 10T_T
<Cynder7> 6Shit
<Kjakings> 7The interesting thing is that when Malefor is taken down by the ghost dragons, there's 5. The four guardians, and who'se the fifth?
<Kjakings> 7who's*
<Yahoo> I shouldn't of hid behind the barrel as long as I did
<gerpie> 10uhhm
<Yahoo> My legs still kinda hurt..
<gerpie> 10werendt these the other purple dragons?
<gerpie> 10wh honor
<gerpie> 10wb*
<gerpie> 10tookd long ;p
<Yahoo> And everytime Serena's brother came past (he was on my team) I kept shooting him
<Yahoo> "STOP SHOOTING ME!!"

<Aicebo> 13gerpie: Spyro is the second purple dragon ever
<Aicebo> 13So no.
<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> Im Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack...
<Kjakings> 7Wait no, only one was a Guardian, the others were still alive

<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: Random dragons. That's how much the ending/plot sucks.

<taco_godess> 14Yup, and Cynder didn't give a crap
<gerpie> 10he became a blue dragon X]
<Rurik> 4causin the world to kasplode
<gerpie> 10i like the crystal he,s wearing
<Kjakings> 7Aicebo: Actually, I think Spyro is the third. Because they said 'rumours of a purple dragon countless generations ago', but didn't say it as if they were referring to Malefor, so he may be the third or even the fourth.
<Yahoo> Yeah
<gerpie> 10ow nuu kja&aicebo fight X]
<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> Oh What the Heck?
<gerpie> 10C7?
<Aicebo> 13Kjakings: There's a cutscene that goes on after you activate the dragon stones of Ignitus telling Spyro that there are only two purple dragons; him and Malefor
<Spyrorocks> (Wow, for once spyrochat is talking about spyro....)
<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> My Tv is having glitches
<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> with my spyro game
<Kjakings> 7And Malefor was alive at the same time as the Ancestors, and I don't think that anyone deserves to becalled 'Ancestors' with a capital 'A' until it was atleast 3000 years ago.
<Yahoo> *argument

<taco_godess> 14My opinion on the ending of DotD: http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-7031-the-quot-talk-about-anything-quot-thread.html?start=705

<Spyrorocks> They start on the next one half way through the previous.
<Aicebo> 13:P

<Yahoo> Lol
<In_Honor_Of_Spyro> 4No
<Aicebo> 13YES
<Kjakings> 7Rurik: Yes, because SR has power over the game designers

<RedDragonX> 0.0
<Rurik> 4I found out what the song is about
<Rurik> 4and I was like 'Holy shit. I've experianced this'
<Aicebo> 13I USED to like that song until SpyroForum fucked up my liking for it
<taco_godess> 14Linkin Park? Arrrrrgh
<Rurik> 4one of the only songs I like by them

<taco_godess> 14Celtic... :)
<Aicebo> 13Amy Lee is kind of arrogant
<Rurik> 4Fall out Boy, Blink-182, Seether, and Senses Fail...you can't get me away from their music
<Aicebo> 13"I'm going to leave you forever, maybe one day you'll ask yourself conciously if someone like me is missing because I'm your shit"

<Aicebo> 13Mine isn't edited.
<Aicebo> 13So you must be mistaken.
<Hail> 11you just typed it in white text.
<Hail> 11and edited
<Hail> 11cause its fuzzy behind photo and bucket.
<Hail> 11the p also isntthe way it is in mine (THE ACTUAL THING)
<Hail> 11-____-
<Aicebo> 13It's fuzzy because screenshots don't come in on Paint well.
<Aicebo> 13and no, it's not edited.
<Hail> 11i did do mine on paint
<Hail> 11\cause you saved it to jpg

<RedDragonX> editing something...who knows
<Rurik> 4@Taco: I dunno, I can't read Hail's typing
<taco_godess> 14hehe

<Hail> 11bbl
<taco_godess> 14What are you talking about, hail?
<Aicebo> 13Wow, Hail, you need to relax. Mine is different than yours. You complain about everything. Learn to pick your fights. Jesus fuckin Christ.
<RedDragonX> some people will never understand differences...
<Rurik> 4only time I lose a fight is when I get bored
<taco_godess> 14It sounded like she was accusing you of editing a website, Aicebo...
<Aicebo> 13She thinks I edited a screenshot of Photobukkit when I didn't
<taco_godess> 14Can you even do that?
<RedDragonX> hm
<Aicebo> 13Apparently.
<taco_godess> 14Hrm... I don't even know what she asked me
<taco_godess> 14"IS PHOTOBUCKET, PHOTOBUKKIT OR PHOTOBUCKET TACO?!"
<RedDragonX> just random crap I assume
<taco_godess> 14It was like she was asking me whether Photobucket is spelled Photobucket or Photobukkit...
<RedDragonX> who knows
*Aicebo 13is spilling blood from Owl/wolf hybrds
*taco_godess 14hates wolves
*Rurik 4likes wolves, but hates people who won't shut up about them
<Aicebo> 13Haha

<darkrath> XD
<Hail> 11 THATS/WHAT/I/WOULD/LIKE/TO/KNOW/
<RedDragonX> not going flat is basic knowledge lol
<darkrath> toeside is a little hard for me...
<RedDragonX> if you have been doing it for awhile then you should know it
<RedDragonX> toeside turns?
<Aicebo> 13Hail: Periods can start from ages 8-14
<Aicebo> 13:P
<RedDragonX> yeah those are usually harder for some
<RedDragonX> well how do you distribute your weight?
<Hail> 11NO AICEBO

<Hail> 11MY SISTER HAS PERIOD AND SHES 18

<darkrath> aicebo said START hail...
<Aicebo> 13They *start* from ages 6-14
<Aicebo> 13Learn to read, woman.
<Hail> 11-_-
<RedDragonX> again it's very hard unless I can actually see you
<RedDragonX> lol
<RedDragonX> but for toeside you have to learn how to be confident on that edge
<RedDragonX> so I can recommend some toeside falling leaf
<darkrath> lol, i like to keep my real self anoymaneous (or however you call it
<darkrath> )
<Hail> 11-_-
<RedDragonX> idc how you want to keep yourself man lol...and I'm pretty sure that I'm not gonna see you on a mountain somewhere in my area so it doesn't really matter :D lol
<Hail> 11Aicebo, about last night.
<darkrath> Do you go up to mt. hood?
<Hail> 11I didn't want "it",Foxy180 I was going to get him into a chat and beat him up with not actions word.
<RedDragonX> Mt. Hood?...as in out west?
<Hail> 11*with not actions, but words.
<darkrath> yes
<Hail> 11Worlds like: You pervert you're such a jerk!
<Rurik> 4Dare I ask what the hell is going on?
<Hail> 11And many others
<Hail> 11:)
<darkrath> XD
<RedDragonX> well seeing as how I live in the heart of New England lol...no I have not been out there lol
<Hail> 11I dunno.
<Aicebo> 13Rurik: Hail's being weird and talking about random crap no one cares about..
<RedDragonX> what else is new?
<Aicebo> 13XD
<Hail> 11Red: What are you tallking about? :]
<darkrath> yeah last time i was up at hood i fell hard on my butt, and i couldn't do anymore runs after that =[
<RedDragonX> right now I'm trying to be a snowboard instructor over the internet lol...something new :D
<Rurik> 4ah shit
<darkrath> XD
<Rurik> 4I lost the pencil
<RedDragonX> and nothing is new in the fact that you are talking about random crap lol
<Rurik> 4I was actually gonna try and draw
<darkrath> lol buy a new one...
<Rurik> 4eh fuck it
<RedDragonX> but yeah if you want to be good at snowboarding you are gonna have to take some hard falls lol
<Rurik> 4I got a raid in 15 min anyway
<darkrath> lol i know, i know, because my dad broke his tailbone once by pushing himself...
<RedDragonX> ouch
<RedDragonX> but yeah you should do some falling leaves on that toeside edge
<darkrath> i know, he couldn't sit down for a month, let alone snowboard
<RedDragonX> to help get use to the balance and the feel
<darkrath> ok, now i must google falling leaves, why does that sound like it's not going to help me?
<RedDragonX> it's easy
<RedDragonX> basically just dig that toeside edge into the mountain
<darkrath> 3ok, then what is it?
<RedDragonX> looking uphill
<darkrath> 3i know that Xd i wasn't looking at the screen XD
<RedDragonX> then slowly take pressure off your left foot..sliding left a little bit....then reverse it then go right
<RedDragonX> always keeping constant pressure on that toeside edge
<darkrath> 3I've done that before, by pure luck...
<RedDragonX> well it's the basic fail safe for getting down a hard trail
<Hail> 11OHHHHHH
<Hail> 11HHHHH
<Hail> 11HH
<Hail> 11HH
<Hail> 11OHHHHHH

<Kjakings> 7:O
<Kjakings> 7Who are you and what have you done with dari?!
<EM99> Hypothermia is the state in which the body's core temperature drops below normal. The core temperature indicates the temperature of the vital organs. If the core temperature is allowed to drop too far, the vital organs will shut down, causing death. As the core temperature drops, the body becomes more and more lethargic.
<Kjakings> 7:O
<Kjakings> 7Who are you and what have you done with dari?!
<Kjakings> 7Yeah and I didn't really need to say that a second time...
<Kjakings> 7Neon: WTF?!

<EM99> Yes, but did you know that I discovered it?
<EM99> :P
<EM99> I was all "If only there was a state in which the body's core temperature drops below normal. The core temperature indicates the temperature of the vital organs. If the core temperature is allowed to drop too far, the vital organs will shut down, causing death."
<EM99> And then I found it, studied it, and died from it.
<EM99> And that's basially how i'm here telling you about it.
<EM99> *I'm
<Kjakings> 7Only Neon would claim he died from it too when claiming he found something out that he didn't.

<EM99> Or stab them.
