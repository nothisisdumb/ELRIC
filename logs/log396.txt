Ohai Shizuka
13what..
I'd rather be somepony else
13i am busy...
WE NEED PONY
Shizuka: it's 0:24. that's technically morning.
:/ i wish i could broadcast here
^
what the hell... is everyone doing crack, the chat is going mad...
0024 isnt morning, its late night
Crack is crack
You don't have enough bronystate points to stream, salvi
crack crack
in space
How is that late night. It's AM.
Gotta run

Later
pizza
Nachos
Nachos, with a good salsa dip
IDK even know who the hell you are Salvi
Later DocSane
It's nightime
umm..what are bronystate points.. im sorta new :D
salvi: it's a joke. No such thing.
It's a joke
-_-
it seams nachos is unanimous
fuck....
13no joke
gotta buy BronyState premium to earn them
Shizuka don't troll the newbies.
bronystate points make the world go round
Quote from a fan in response "My son loved the original clip, he played it over and over, and when it first aired, he said that Derpy "is clumsy and talks funny like me but they still let her try!" The original clip made a child who is﻿ bullied and made fun of in school very very happy. The edit made him cry because "guess she's just not good enough." He also wanted to know why Rainbow Dash now talks to her like she's stupid
I had Nachos last night!
13you need bronystate gold membership to learn whether it's a joke or not
Theyr'e too delicate
Trust the mod
you can trade bronystate points for nachos
can i trade points for pasta tickets
/me has the most bronystate points
BECAUSE SOMEONE STOLE MY PASTA
You can trade nachos for Dremora hearts.
AND ALL MY TICKET
/me has swag!
Firefly: PASTA
Ouch Paradise92
/me hands Firefly pasta and a ticket.
YES
Just... just ouch
/me is currently afraid of the chat and hides in a corner.
I have the most awesome hiccups
Firefly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmYkUEnIzYY Like that?!
/me steals is
.....i'm afraid to click on that link
and you use dremora hearts to get dremora armor
Do it, it's fun. :D
I like dragon armour better
the link is fine
So....Is some gentlman going to stream?

IT SOUNDS TOO ADORABLE
StinkomanFan: if only you were more like me. You'd feel fine.
MAKE IT STOP
sodoi need tobe on the moon for a thousand years to be a mod or what ?
I'M NOT ADORABLE I'M TOUGH

LOVE AND LOLERATE
thats what it said StinkomanFan
Ask Gokaiger ponies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx7ldTl7txQ
StinkomanFan: Fluttershy disaproves
09,01I was thinking of setting myself up for hire for a long term endeavour like that. Basically whomever hires me calls the shots, and I'd draw what they tell me. Something like $2-3 per tumblr sketch/picture. The contractor would handle the actual workings of the tumblr, I would just draw.
that is what it said
That could work
do it
Firefly...Dont you want to make a box?
Hah now i got another dinner, and i shall be flying so you can not steal it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWpSklVzm4
09,01so, anybody interested?
Do you have samples, DCD?
09,01sure I do
dinner is too mainstream, have breakfast
Where was I... OH RIGHT, So Firefly how about that Royal treatment?
dawwww http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3129/
Oh Scootaloo, you so silly
/me gives soul

O.o
Firefly...Yes or no?
That Dashie
i dont think ANYONE will be as successful in comedy as the stooges were...
09,01so yeah, I could allow you to "contract" me for an ask tumblr. Payment per picture. Anybody interested in something like that?
Derpy_Hooves: except pinkie
Derpy_Hooves Monty Python
^
Well, there were many options when it came to comedy at the time.
Sounds great DCD!
Firefly... come ON I haven't gotten any from anyone other than the princesses for MONTHS
Interested, yes. Feasible given my personal life? Not really.
CCCP: Wait me?
Quite nice, DCD
My internet doesn't always derp, but when it does, it does it at the most random of time.
Pinkieruler124: yes u
I just can't see Fluttershy that bold.
Parasprites, no!
Applejack, maybe
Hopefully that works out
Grrrrr
CCCP: Get on Garrys mod and start modding. :P
one does not just make fluttershy bolder
:P
09,01well if anybody's interested in such an arrangement
09,01send me a PM or something
Firefly's standing me up :c
:s
o.o
/me stands on Firefly
Why won't RIFT download faster? >m<

09,01I wanna see if I can save up and buy some S.H. Figuarts to do more toy reviews for you guys, but to do that, I need to get money first.
dari-bot...
CrossCrop114 Because
you touch
We have a smiley face thing for a reason
Omg CCCP thats fabulous
...Why are people standing on me?
yourself at night
ogod so SAUCY
i am dari-bot
LadyCanary: :)
did you do that review already?
:P
NewDCD: y u no job?
Firefly, how about I give you the ROYAL treatment?
getting bored of the word "saucy". will now say sexy
Someone should team up with DCD and do a Ask Dari-bot
Firefly Because
I deserve a royal treatment. /nod nod
...
09,01I no job because I med student
/me stands on Firefly for some reason
Molestia counts as royal treatment.
YOU ALL HEARD IT
09,01(and my faculties rules don't allow me to have a part-time job)
IT'S NOT RAPE ON MY PART
09,01*faculty's
that sucks
09,01but I suppose freelance drawing =/= a part time job
NewDCD: um, how do they expect you to survive without a FRIGGIN JOB?
Yeah that 3rd pic sort of scares me on EQD
WHAT
NewDCD: how old are you again?
I DON'T WANT MOLESTIA
or to be stood on
Ofc you do
WHAT AM I A TABLE
stacy's mom has got it going on~
Everypony wants Molestia. Whether they know it or not.
/flee
Meanwhile: you would say that...
Wow, not being allowed a part-time job is harsh. :(
But I do love the Derpy Hooves + Pinkie Pie + Dr. Hooves = Dr. Who
/me flips Firefly
/me licks Firefly's ear
Come on Firefly, I've only gotten any from the princesses in the past Year!
I've been thinking of doing freelance programming after college
she's all i wan't and i waited for soo lng~
otakon: I know I'd say that. Though maybe not for a few days.
*From anyone other
stacy can't you see~
ewwww. No licking.
HNNNG
SAVE ME
your just not the girl for mee~
NewDCD: seriously, no. How does that even work? You need a job to afford housing and food and amenities, how do they expect you to live?
otakon: loans obviously!
09,01they expect me to live how I have till now
Maybe Surprise will be up for some nice, tender loving
09,01WITH MY MOTHER HUEHUEHUEHUE
WAT
09,01no but seriously the culture over here is different
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4&ob=av3e
NewDCD: and your how old? I'm not judging, I'm just wondering is all.
At least you're in training DCD. I'm in the same boat, minus that crucial part.
09,01kids don't move out when they go to college, at least not usually
09,0120
NewDCD: bc I too live with my mother and am out of work.
I DON'T NEED NO SURPRISE LOVING
HAI GURLZ
09,01but yeah, over here
09,01the "dorm system" doesn't exist
Allo Ziltoidian.
otakon NewDCD Oh wow! I live at home too :(
Well Firefly, I wanted me to have the Surprise loving because you turned me down :c
09,01the universities/colleges are just institutions you visit, kind of like high school, and have no housing installations
Same ~
I forgot...Where are you DCD?
Its ok. The dorm system is odd here sometimes too. I know colleges that require you to live in the dorm
09,01Panama
I liked living in the dorms
They dont look like the ones from the show, but theyre still muffins :P
ah
Me too.
NewDCD: yh, here you would have been expected to move out, get a full time job, take out a loan on a house and have a fiancee waiting to tie the knot right out of college.
I miss it a lot, to be honest.
What i find weird is that they can decide that you aren't allowed to work part-time on your free time. :P
09,01so yeah, over here, you don't move out till muuuuuch later
so much freedom you can do
RaveBrony: YAY! HAPPY DERPY DAY!
:$
i miss the dorms too
This is the song written for the train chase, this is the song, Rocky and Ken, HE TRIED TO KILL ME WITH A FORKLIFT!
09,01or well
Muffins or Cupcakes? Which is more delicious.
But I know a ton of parents who just kick their kid out at 18
celebrated derpy day by eating 3 muffins
Muffins
Depends
09,01that's how it works with most other faculties
Muffins
09,01but in my med school, it's kind of like
hello
you people scare me
Muffins, cupcakes. Both kinda make me think "Eh"
muffins turn me on
never ate cupcakes, so can't decide
I'M NOT A TABLE
Red velvet cupcakes > all
I'm pretty much out of it. I broke up with my girlfriend of five years. So much for marriage.
I like cupcakes
09,01"We forbid it because bitch, if you worked, you would have a 0% chance to pass this shit, cause this shit is INTENSE"
I love cupcakes. So sweet and tasty.
Firefly well, this is the internet
you know i'm not the little boy that i used to be i'm all grown up and baby can't you see~
DID SOMEONE SAY TABLE?!
┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
:D
XD
Yea, that i can understand. Med School is hell, atleast so i hear. :P
Firefly I'm a grown stallion! I HAVE NEEDS!
Sorry to hear that Randomnerd.
mario_pony: hola
┻━┻
09,01most other careers are like "you work? Yeah okay cool. We have night shifts too"
what the weres the rest of my username :o
That was two years ago. It was my fault, trust me.
09,01to put it simply: Med School is a full-time job for them
HNNNG
well from what I've seen, it can be difficult balancing a job and school at once
NO YOU DON'T
CCCP: hola como estas este dia?
WHAT USERNAME? *nom*
Sorry. That's way too personal, I'll be random.
Is the college there more like an extended schooling system, where everyone just automatically goes after high school?
I'LL BE RANDOM NOW

Twilight and Posey said it was good, so I decided I'd try it.
No, poines are the answer
Turns out it tastes pretty good.

Why did I instantly think of the Sea Horses song during that song?
so we can't eat yet
Firefly BLASPHEMY
Don't know why Suprise likes that stuff.
*surprise
what are those furries creature?
yay my pasta is done yay
PAAAASTAAA!
:D
The only good kind is pizza and chocolate kind.
/me steals and eats all of Eulshy's pasta
lol, LittleKuriboh beats up the Nostalgia Critic.
Any other kind is terrible.
doesn't matter have more
I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but i've a nagging fear
and it's delicious
~
/me eats the more too
smooze sounds like some creepy grimer evolution
/me has endless pasta
I must stop listening to the Back to the Future song before I start adding words to the song myself
let's build scyscraper with nokia
Nothing can stop the Smooze!
/me somehow manages to eat all the endless pasta
nokia does
)I can stop the smooze
...You know, next time I catch a grimer or muk, I'll have to name it TheSmooze
just pause the video
You built a time machine out a car!?
:) Oh I got a good one, a few years ago, one of the anime conventions I went to, had a movie room...
i save you ! tree power activated ! :(
Fluttershy power activated?
Eulshy I will make you say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! somehow
asdf foar 3v4r
Pffff, Posey is way better.
Anime conventions are too much for me now.
I doubt you will
well i stole your face :)
oh, great scott! and doc brown just got shot! I don't know how, but they found him at the malllllll!
Too little that I recognize.
Randomnerd: Why is that? Though I may have a feeling why
One of the movies that I managed to catch was Transformers or something of that nature, filmed in Japan
Its older than the US movies
Beef stroganof is delicious
Eulshy eliminates all of Eulshy's eating utensils necessary to eat the pasta
kids react to asdf?
*/me
I wish I knew what the title was
LadyCanary: Not enough Anime I recognize. Aside from DBZ and Sailor Moon.
2:35AM, my alarm goes off at 6AM ... ffffffuuuuu
also noticed that video is filled with quotes
SEE YOU EVERYPONY
Ah I gotcha Randomnerd.
seeya Saigneur
US Manga Corporation's Horrible Dubs!
See ya Saigneur
Saigneur: i know that feeling
/me eats pasta with a dagger
But I do like "Gosick".
/me eliminates Eulshy's dagger
/me nomz LadyCanary
/me ish nommed
I'm not a big convention type of guy. My brother works at Comic-con and I've been there 3 times.
/me nomz LordCelestia
flutter_spin: Nice! Conventions can be a bit much.
I want to go to a con someday
/me eats with a sword, quite awkwardly
Dken2021: Go to BRONYCON
never made it a comic con, Mainly one that are held in Texas.
/me eliminates Eulshy's sword
Puhhhh, you are eating with a sword?
but Ihave no way to go to bronycon :(
okay, NOW my mom is here
I'm planning on three conventions this year.
You people are weird.
/me uses another sword
so I am off to go eat, see y'all later
/me snatches Eulshy's other sword.
bye, otakon
Bronystate: where everyone's a silly filly, even the males
I'm also not the person who would go to a concert either. Never have been to one.
/me eliminates all of the swords accessible to Eulshy
Later otakon ~
/me uses hand axe
i have a lot of these things
/me eliminates all hand axes accessible to Eulshy
Steampunk World's Fair in New Spursey, BronyCon, and ConnectiCon

she looks good
/me uses cup
If anypony lives in or around Texas, houston's next anime convention is Anime Matsuri in April
/me eliminates all hand cups accessible to Eulshy
she has nice big "packages"
/me uses hoofs
I still think her bubbles are too big
agreed Dken2021, they are a bit big...
/me chops off Eulshy's front hooves
But that specific artist draws them big
/me uses wings
mmmm blood sauce
/me chops off Eulshy's wings
Besides that, she looks awesome.
Better big than exposed.
/me uses back hoofs
/me chops off Eulshy's back hooves
/me weird boner
This fandom...
this is starting to be a bad fan fic
/me uses face
/me duct tapes Eulshy's mouth shut
It's super-effective!
wrong choice
/me licks tape till un adhesive
flutter_spin: Omg that is amazing. :O
You can't eat pasta if you can't open your mouth
ive seen that pic before flutter_spin, guess you're right, they do just do them kind of big
twilight "tomes" are kinda big for her body
/me pushes off with tounge
What is too big in that pic?
Rikki?
The entire artist panel can be a bit um, out there.
/me cuts out Eulshy's tongue then re-duct tapes mouth
But the 3 human mlp versions are the best I've seen
rawr
:P
but it's a pretty picture regardless
Cypresswolf: I thought Rikki was a man and they just completely warped his voice.
rawr to you SilverStreak
/me bleeds on tape untill un adhesive

/me chews it off
/me dislikes Vic Minogna. And his crazy fanbase
/me continues to eat
human ponies are best humans
I'm more of a Yuri Lowenthal girl.
/me pulls out Eulshy's teeth then re-duct tapes mouth
I havent seen Vin Minogna in a couple years now actually
6_9 HAPPY DERPY DAY!!!
LadyCanary Vic who?
Exactly
Minogna was Yu-Gi-Oh, right?
/me wonders why people are letting him be brutally disfigured while trying to eat pasta
Yes
Oh, and Ed! I know FMA well enough :)
Eulshy because this is the internet
SilverStreak your back
oh my, aanthro ponie :|
that one is really well done as well flutter_spin
I like it
/me leaves
i'm trying to find another humanized at the gala one i saw previously, their "package" size wasnt as big so i preferred it
:(
toot a loo MASF123
/me pushes tape in mouth on the bowl, eats tape, continues to eat
Im not sure if Vic was Yu-gi-oh, I do know he voiced Edward Elric in original dubbed FMA
Yeah. I loved their outfits, but its a little awkward on the faces
That's actually pretty cute, flutter_spin
/me throws Eulshy in a pond, snickering.
Twi in that outfit is awesome
I like Rarity's
/me eliminates all the pasta accessible to Eulshy
/me has endless pasta, uses magic to heal self, swims out continues to eat
The dresses were very well adapted
/me kicks....cow dirt, if you know what I mean, on Eulshy, bursting out laughing.
/me the pasta is still eliminated and out of Eulshy's reach though
http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132956586179.jpg
no, not that one
but I like that one
Luna!! <3
I forgot where I got this from but apple family humans: http://derpy.me/zizpI
/me cow dirt don't matter been in worse

"Give him another burst"
Okay, Cypresswolf, do you know Record of Lodoss War?

I liked Sailor Mercury. You probably see a pattern seeing I like Fluttershy too
I remember how yu yu hakusho was screwed over by Cartoon network
Dang.
mmm my pasta is finally mine to enjoy in peace yay
I watched dubbed Sailor Moon every morning before i went to Elementary School. xD
flutter_spin: Indeed!
/me teleports pasta away from Eulshy and uses anti-magic spell on Eulshy to eliminate his powers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2tQKejS9Fo best nitro
intro
An anime based on a D&D campaign!
I watched it every Friday in my cousin's room and made henshin poses.
lol Yu Yu Hakusho was so odd looking
haha
MOON PRISM POWER, MAKE UP!
/me is using artificial magic anyway
/me this necklace
I remeber getting up in the mornings to watch sailor moon because I didn't want anyone to know I watch it
You do guys know there is a continuous livestream that shows Toonami shows called: Toonami Aftermath, right?
So, who wants Haaaaam?
/me spell sheilds my magic necklace
/me gives Eulshy anti-pasta
Toonami still airs?
You can't pay for cookies with ham

http://www.toonamiaftermath.com/
I thought that disapeard like 10 years ago when CN was starting to go downhill
/me gets more pasta and eats

In fact, Sailor Moon is coming on in an hour on that stream
why so Capn_fisty ?
You're not a laughingstock, Capn_fisty!
ooh, cow and chicken
but im apparently coverd in anti-pasta
/me bursts into flames
/me extinguishes Midnight_Tempest
They have had a ton of weird airings mixed in
awwww
And yes, that is where I've seen The Room Riffed.
Who tried to purge you, Midnight_Tempest ?
finally peace wiht my pasta
(pasta that moves backwards in time)
I've heard of a Funimation Channel, but dont know what became of it. I havent seen it in any channel line up from Dish, Comcast, or whatever other competitor satelite companies offer
Well, 5minutes of it before i realized what "The Room" was about
Was it the Spess Mehreens?
no one Randomnerd, i tend to burst into flames on my own... usually on a whim
Ah, okay.
/me casts Incinerate

MFW a video loaded faster than an image
well well well otakon
guys is 70 push ups a good amount?
Eulshy: god why did they make popo blue
Hm...
Those anthro ponies look kinda cute; probably because the originals don't quite look like ponies.
Sounds a bit forced, flutter_spin I could understand that
guys who wants to play the quiet game, which also means no typing
Fluttershy is the world champ, you know
Whut.
chichi has some very developed assets for a little girl
then lets play
Gunthler: Yeah

Gunthler: How many can you do without breaking?

Cypresswolf: YES!

flutter_spin: yh, but it's BEEN out on LIVE and PSN for like 3 years now
the hobbit? meh... im less than enthusiastic about that movie
Someone told me about this awhile ago and there's a new one today - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dvPKrHf3SY&feature=g-logo&context=G2d67e92FOAAAAAAACAA
Yeah. I thought so. I just never payed attention too much
blogs from the Hobbit sets :)
hmm
how long was i gone
Yeah. Who here is going to see Hobbit 3d? Skeptical or awesome?
no
I"m just gonna go see it
long enough for me to go afk to get some pasta
I'm not seeing it in 3D.
I'm going to see it normally
I'm not into the 3d hype
I just hope I live to see it in the theatres :)
3d blows
But I'm their huckleberry, so I'll watch it.
did i win the quiet contest?
I saw how they were filming it all in the 3d cameras, but I just can't muster up seeing 3d
Call me when they've launched Virtual Reality instead. :P
You're the world champ, piyo
it wasn't officially ended so no
And I return!! Have I missed anything good?
so who won?
what i can't wait for is Men In Black 3!!!
Yes, RaveBrony - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dvPKrHf3SY&feature=g-logo&context=G2d67e92FOAAAAAAACAA
/me screams

RaveBrony: nothing
Hell no

MiB 3 is epic!
It's men in black,
I laughed. Not sure if it would be worth watching, but still funny.
Oh snap, Cypresswolf :D
so noone has won yet?
I'm booored.
piyo: won what?
So far my list includes: Avengers, Brave, and Hobbit.
Yea, Avengers. <3
flutter_spin: sounds good

Barve? why?
*brave
mario_pony: BRAVE! hold on
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4EZULqhP2E

I want to see this the most
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1I4Stb-o8

Snuffsis: King wrote novellas about kids killing eachother in a dictatorship before Battle Royale
Cypresswolf: go watch Project X
I think......the Navy Seals movie
Yea, i know Stephen King... xD
If i were a deep one
Well, to be fair, the Kids don't kill each other in the Long Walk.

:P
Dat Alter Kocker Cthulu
awesome song.
Project X doesnt show until 12:01 am O_o
But it is awkward hearing her speech in that voice. I prefer only hearing the derpy-voice ... with derpy personality
hey there cthulhu hows it in you sunken city?
hehe
106 push-ups, 3 sets of 35
:S
:|
;)
is that bueno?
she makes very good points though
People in general are just afraid of offending people
although i was thinking her same solution before i even saw the video:
thats 105 hombre
Yeah. I just wish she wasn't so sarcastic
i did one extra
Reminds me of my step-sister. She was beyond annoying.
Act of Valor 9:10 :) Im gonna get ready, later
change her voice, change her name, fine. change her eyes, god dammit hasbro

Ah that RoseyPony. VERY amusing.
mario_pony: well, seeing as that entire Trilogy was about KILLING GOD, I'm not surprised.
:)
seriously!!:O
Inquisitor: no, because I'm not a SIX FOOT SCOTSMAN!
mario_pony: yeah. A pair of teenagers literally kill God in the last book.
wow that makes my heart feel weird...
and it's all about how the Church equates Free Will with Sin, and want all living people to be unthinking and unfeeling.
god creates dinosaurs. god destroys dinosaurs. god creates man. man destroys god. man creates dinosaurs
i feel as though
dinosaurs kill man, woman inherits the earth
this is weird way of talking
the author essentially said he wanted to create "an atheist answer to the Chronicles of Narnia"
jurassic park...
what's going on here ~
We have a winner!
Pullman! that's his name!
couldn't remember it for a moment.
the golden compass writer was evil....
never saw golden compass
What makes him evil? Does he flick off kittens and punch babies?
Krakass: maybe
Inquisitor: don't. That movie sucks balls.
who HASN'T punched a baby though? I mean... BOOOO
id punch a baby
but never flick a kitten
but why would he do that say bad things about other people religions
In my defense, the baby was kinda being a dick.
mario_pony: because he's kind of an asshole. But asshole =/= evil.
...That's kinda mean spirited :/
Dont hurt the babies :P
:(
TURN ALL THE BABIES
INTO KITTENS
Krakass and FlutterEul: i would punch you two!
i know a squirrel who gave babies magical candies of dreams!
and really, while I have serious disagreements with Pullman's feelings on religion and faith, the stories he wrote, and the way he wrote them, were damn good.
whoo... I got off scott free from mario_pony's vengeance!
L
o
L
Ingwaz: i would throw you in a pit
RAWRity: Yeah, the worlds he describes are beautiful
Poor Ingwaz.
that crap for?
Inquisitor: i would throw you in a fire
mario_pony: but Ingwaz didn't do anything!
aaaaa I don't want to go find those books and read 'em again
Ingwaz: sowy tab fail
mario_pony is just a very violent pony.
I have the entire trilogy on my bookshelf right now.
He jumps on turtles' heads for no reason.
no i'm not!!!!
:)<3;)
Krakass: sooooo? i don't see your point
^ better love story than twilight
in mario's defense the turtles do ask for it...
^
mario_pony x Krakass is best Love story
/me makes a disgusted face.
they look at me funny
You guys are mushy.
Krakass? eeeeewwwwww
im having so
much fun doing
this
um....
Krakass: lol jk
last book I read was Warhammer 40,000: Hammer and Anvil and now I'm pickin up Hitchhiker's Guide
Of course you were, cause I'm dead smexy.
Anyone here that knows math? Need a bit of help. :P
smexy?
Snuffsis: me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's like sexy, but better.
i tab back in to Krakass being sexy?
Okay, i'll PM you then. :P
I have a book you all should pick up: http://www.amazon.com/This-Book-Full-Spiders-Seriously/dp/0312546343
SPIDERS!
Snuffsis: what grade are you in?
PUNCH EM!
I wen't to art school, I can't help you with anything remotely academic
it's a sequel to "John Dies At The End"
I'm studying at university. :P
went to even
It is RAWRity? Well dang
Fear me i
have many voices
Pythagorean theorem is the answer Snuffsis
LadyCanary: eeyup. Due out in October.
Krakass: Thats just..., no, wrong... :P
"John Dies At The End" followed by "This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It"
Well then you're asking the wrong question.
Well thats a very attractive title :p
Oh, wth! What causes the chat to derp? My computer must hate me, lol
I am a pegasus and
i have no idea what i'm doing
I'm not actually asking for the length of the hypotenuse
so....
I cause the chat to derp
What are you asking for?
i got the number (5^x+5^-x)^2 and i'm supposed to simplify it. :P
OH XD
hold on one sec
1
42
I derped my eyes today on purpose
ran into stuff about 5 times
I got it as 5^2x+5^-2x but answer sheet says it's 5^2x + 2 + 5^-2x
wouldn't that be 0^2?
sorry, I'm dumb, that's not right, urgh. Hang on, lemme get some paper.
Math?
6_9
Snuffsis: Remember, dont just distribute the exponent to the other exponents
???
the answer to life, the universe and everything is 42
the number twilight has in that episode
wait I'm confused here, is the variable the exponent?
um....
/me is confused with all this math talk
Snuffsis: it's because you've got to set it as (5^x + 5^-x)(5^x + 5^-x
(5^x + 5^-x)^2 = (5^x + 5^-x) * (5^x + 5^-x)
the fuck is this?
So theres a third term
math
Maths
math
08,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwRMYz1vfcQ
which should be 3
*2
math
This is mathematics, the language of science!
lolmybad XD
this is 0
Hmm...
Math its so hard
then you just FOIL it.
FOIL?
Or...you know... nonsense... we can do nonsense with Math too
...
I really don't see where the +2 comes from, but oh well. xD
13NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
FOIL
First Inner Outer LAST
lol Shizuka XD
minotaurs in equestria
Hey math guys
/me is nerd
I divided by zero
/me puts on his best evil voice: "Argh! FOIL'd again!"
Damnit
Shizuka: <3
and they are intelligent
now what
...
I could never do foil in the right order.
Snuffsis: take (5^x + 5^-x) * (5^x + 5^-x) and FOIL it.
0/0 is NOT Undefined. Its indefinet form
does the world explode
math is not hard it's just awfully repetitive ~
Shizuka!!! :D :D
or just the number
Math is soooooooooooooo EASY
13canary~<3
true true
/me now forced to choose between being a dragon or a minotaur
/me hugs Shizuka. How is you sweetie
;A;
Math is useful. Learning Math is tedious as all hell.
^
13so busy ><
13big things coming~
Dragons are bigger. Get Imp Knockdown and spam it like you mean it
/me hugs Shizuka
but math is pure and simple logic??
RAWRity: Foil meaning? It's a bit hard since i'm studying in Swedish, anot English. So i on'y know the Swdish terms. :P
Breadmeister~
13flaria~
:3 How exciting!
0/0 :3
it*
whats wrong with pure and simple logic?
ITS INDEFINET FORM
it doesnt count :3
Logic requires rational thought! We cant' have that!
Snuffsis, First Outer Inner Last
1/0.... oh shi-
I mean... if everyone started using Logic...
Inquisitor: NOOOOOOOO
what if something divided by zero
will lead us to Equestria?
the world would explode
/Valno
nope
/me uses logic
pinkie logic ?
/me is freaking the buck out
right
i lost my homework!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dog eat it?
OMG what am i gonna do!?
and pinkie pie uses logic, its how she breaks the fourth wall. :U
so movie night is tomorrow and the front page is still not updated
Troll logic +
Pinkie logic =
whats movies/ponies are being played tomorrow
a black hole
/me is breathing hard
using logic in a nological place breaks the diemsional walls
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
allowing for more sillyness
and party fun
whats movies/ponies are being played tomorrow
oh you guys are soo boring
don't even care im using two names
Snuffsis: take the first number in each set of brackets, and multiply them. This time it would be 5^x * 5^x. Then the first in the first set of parentheses, and the last in the second. So it's 5^x * 5^-x. Then the 2nd number in the first set times the first number of the second set. 5^-x * 5^x. Then the last number in each set. 5^.x * 5^-x.
what am i gonna doooo!?!?!?!?!?
FOIL
/me is a twilight sparkle
i'm gonna fail science!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and a futtershy
then i'm gonna have to redo the 8th grade!!!!!!!!11
hmmm
with a good dash of rainbow dash
Yea, did that. But i didn't get 5^2x+2+5^-2x. the +2 they say it is, became a +10 for me... :P
ask a rhetorical question then answer it mario_pony
They're going to send you to science kindergarten.
oh wait it's in my pocket
Dun dun dun.
Then you add the together, like this: (5^x*5^x)+(5^x*5^-x)+(5^-x*5^x)+(5^-x+5^-x)
/me facehoofs
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tOtPERJ8r8&feature=player_embedded#!
shoot me
/me shoots FlutterEul
nooo thats my math homework!!!1
What.
AAH i see what i did wrong
wheres my scince homework!!!!!!!!
Snuffsis: While foiling the broblem
...
yeah you got it :3
so you get (5^2x)+(5^0)+(5^0)+(5^-2x)
lol ping myself
FlutterEul
nonononono
is fun
Whis is 5^2x+1+1+5^-2x
mario_pony:
5^x * 5^-x = 1
Yea, i didn't do 5^0, i just removed the exponent completely making it 5+5 instead of 5^0+5^0 :P
1 * 2
=2
which is 5^2x+2+5^-2x
so the middle term is two
mario_pony: your gonna fail school!!!!
Thanks for helping me figure out what i did wrong. <3
yep :3
mario_pony: i know
No prob ^_^
mario_pony: how could you looose it!?
mario_pony: i don't know!!
no problem. I had that shit drilled into my head when I was learning Algebra in high school.
lol Im not even in college yet XD
FlutterEul double ping
I don't even use it anymore, but I remember it. Damn you Mr. Wood and you're 1 1/2 arms!
Eulshy
oh god
was the other half of an arm a wood prothstetic?
but seriously though,you MUST FOIL it right
Game Development?
Games = Physics = Much matho
Do Computer Science dude :p
And math as well.
Math is helpful for that...
Yea, i'm going to (if plands hold out) study at the same university as the guys behind Magicka
/me splashes twilight sparkle with cursed water from spring of drowned hot blooded stallion. :U
but Learning to program is 90 percent of it
doing Game Development
Krakass: nope, just a strange nub that bent at the elbow
Krakass Physics is simpler math though. Atleast i think so.
maybe it's in my mom's car i'll go check brb
mu reaction at my first day of college for software engineer "Oh God Why"
DON'T YOU USE UR FANCY MATHMATICS ON ME
I got it easier to wrap my head around physics than complex mathematics
Physics :3333
Dat vector math
i wonder if any of my rp sites updated?
its so easy because everything is formulaic
Yea
It's not THAT many calculations to do either
at least in a vacuum XD
irl physics is serious biz
I mean, everything has a letter to it so you can just write a formula in physics like E=mc^2
And Flash player crashes yet again! Talk about Derpy day :\
(not really, but the point remains hte same:P)
well, not everything, Snuffsis :p
Most of the stuff, gravity, newton, force, wavelength, amplitutde
yeah that stuff is simple
all the important basic stuff has a letter to it
As long as you ignore air resistance and friction physics is easy.
Now PARTICLE PHYSICS
thats hard
Ignoring gravity simplifies things even further
Yea, i'm not going into particle physics field
i'm going into game development. xD
Idk if i will
Well don't use particle emitters then.
At most i'll need to be able to do calculations in 3d space, if i want to develop my own graphics engine
game development is a cool thing to get into, but let me warn you, learning to program for the first time may induce RAEG
Otherwise it's all linear algebra
There's plenty of middleware availble these days for games development.
Physics engines, lighting engines, etc.
i only passed algebre skill II
id there anything to whatch tonight?
no dusk
bah gtg :p Wont be here for BMN... so ill see you guys during the new ep ^_^
Krakass: True, but this university i'm at is high quality, they will let you develop your own engine completely.
It's the same university where the Magicka team graduated from.
Thanks jffry890
I had to look Magicka up, seems like neat game.
buck it,s not in my moms car!:'(
Wow, didn't know about Magicka? xd
mario_pony, check your other pocket.
HAPPY DERPY DAY
so what're the movies being shown tomorrow?
Well, if you want to check the work being done at my uni check this site
http://gscept.com/
everything there is made by graduate students.
sooo yeah http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc
Just what i needed TheGreatAndPowerfulT <3
HAPPY DERPY DAY!!!
Raiders of the Lost Ark and Machete for BMN

well, raiders was the best jones movie... second being last crusade
:O
I always have this argument with Saxy.
Inquisitor you mean Temple of doom is second best
He thinks there are 4 Indy movies.
I think there are 3.
i just ate a baked bad
Isn't there only 3 movies?
I hate dbz, but that image is awesome RAWRity
/me thinks LadyCanary is right
:3
and it's not that bad
ther'es 3 movies nd an abortion.
Tell Saxy that when he comes in.
Just like there were no Matrix sequels.
haha
/me loves the muffin TheGreatAndPowerfulT gave
star wars had 3 abortions
anything playing :O
nope
Well, sorry Canary, but i just forgot about "The Last Crusade" :(
ah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc should just be left on the stream when there's nothing else.
Snuffsis: Wasnt as bad as the supposed 4th.
Well, best movie is still evil nazis using magic
Indeed Krakass
/me rolls around on a large piece of wool
:3
LadyCanary: NEVER watch Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
going to add as many of you guys as i can on steam friends... oh oh oh
Krakass: what theeeeeeeeeee
Too late Randomnerd.
I did
aliens...
So did I. D8
In the words of Saxy to me: If jesus then aliens.
o.o
All of the Indiana Jones moview had their flaws.
survives a nuke in a lead cased fridge... I CALL BULLLLLLSHIT!
aeiou
I remember walking into the student union at my school and there was a guy in the corner crying, I asked what was up, and one of his friends came up and said "aliens in the new indiana jones movie" and I had to supress the lulz
and sometimes w

damn
Machete is good yes
Because they BUCKED WITH THE WRONG MEXICAN
LadyCanary: eeyup, I haven't seen it yet but I've heard good things
I mean Machete is bad in a good sense.
thank god we're going to watch raiders
Shizuka: he was also the professor from Sliders
I've seen it.
And to think, it was originally a PARODY TRAILER
Midnight_Tempest: Arturo!
yay!
Buck it!
Man, I remember that show
it was pretty good
People, i demand you to tell me your steam id!
Sliders was the first thing I remember John Reese Davies from
it's otakon17
Sliders was an awesome show
Snuffsis: you'll find most of us on the Bronystate group there
Yea, but like i said, TOO MANY MEMBERS
T_T
Yup, I'm about halfway down the list.
<----same name Snuffsis
my hear feels like it's gonna explode!
And most people don't even have their steam IDs the same as they do in the IRC :P
I'd give out my steam name, but I usially only play single player games on steam... forever alone
Well, someone figured me out.
usually even
is anything playing?
yes
Nope.
Buffer circle is playing
:0
best stream is buffer stream
i see that
e'ry day m' bufferin

One of these weeks I'm going to stop saying I'm going to sign up and actually sign up.
Because its boring?
bronystate@gmail.com right?
RoflBot: Check your junkmail
And hopefully non-offensive
Krakass: ...why is that a link to c-span
I don't even know how to go about sigining up for the newsletter
Yup RoflBot
To edjumacte people.
so does anyone know what the final conclusion to the derpy incident was?
Inquisitor: Just PM a mod. :P
i got no email from them
was it just itunes?
Derpy is derpy, but less derped.
RoflBot: It's from bronystate@derpy.me

mario_pony: like what you wanted me to do?
11,01I won't continue.

As to comply with the charge that I amm to continue to post pics, being kicked will terminate such, and as I was told to post no matter what i will slow image flow to a pic per minute. That way I will not be failing my charge in either way.
Hmm, my mind is perverted.. i read LC|BUSYPONY as LC|Bustypony... :(
Alrighty then, it's your website :P can't wait for tomorrow

/me enjoys the insanity of the chat and noms his muffins.
hmm, the square root square root out of something is the same as the 3rd root of that thing right?
Discord would love this
Incentive: actually, better question is who told you to just keep posting images? What, you have no free will of your own or they have a gun to your head?
13Snuffsis: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the short legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse
I looked I am not spamming, I am neither flooding the chat with irrelevant images, ponies being them.
13Incentive: You have been asked to stop. Stop.
otakon I was not told to tell.
Thank you Shizuka, i almost forgot about that. :)

Everyyone lobed them
otakon indeed ~
its a religion for the spreading of our three keys
[SWAG]Haku: awesome
/me steals stolen muffin and runs off
love, tolerance, and friendship (of course)
We believe that when we die we shall be reborn as ponies in Equestria
otakon I made it, why wouldnt it be?
Bacon muffins? Doesn't sound that tasty
Maybe it exists.
How do we know if we'd be ponies?
bacon cupcakes <3
as soon as anything becomes a relgion... well... everything goes to shit after that, thats for sure
Why not fragons?
Dragon
s
or griffons?
or any other sentient being of equestria?
Midnight_Tempest agreed ~
mules cows sheeps
We can debate that in the chapels Haku
OMG Shizuka. FOREVER I WILL PLAY
When Haku dies, Haku wishes to be a... Diamond Dog
Then, Haku will open Gen store
and make millions

yeah... its like that, but its still an awesome game
ive put more hours into F:NV than Fallout 3... just cause of the DLC
oblivion is the same, a bit glitchy but awesome
so, what' the largest amount of time you've put into a game?
0,14360+ hours
Hm....
0,14Pokemon Sapphire
I'm waiting for my cous to pass down Amnesia, Arkham City, and Raymon Origins
over ~ 400 hours
DAMN Saxy.
0,14I think it's close to 400?
World of Warcraft. Who knows how many hours
hahah SaxyPretender mine was ruby !
0,14RIVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
I know Mine's on Pokemon White. Lemme check real quick.
:P
I'd say mine was in Pokemon Leaf Green.
600+ hours... Mass Effect 2, PC and XBo 360 verisons combined total...
anyone else think there should be a derpy hooves room?
317 hours in Pokemon White. Not bad for only being out a year, eh?
Here recently? 220 hours in Skyrim
:[_________________________]
Ingwaz: i dont know anymore... my XBox HD burned out... thats why i played the PC version :$

hi BritishBrony
especially considering there's jack shit to do when you finish the main storyline
I thought about getting Rift a trial and perhaps Aion since it went f2p
Heythar.
0,14317? that's my birthday!
:P
wait, let me check something...
Saxy is oooooooooooooold.
LOL
aww, that would have been cool.
0,14XD
Lol, there were quads born on the day of a leap year. :3
I was hoping Black/White released in the US on 3/17
but nope. 3/10
Skyrim was THE game I got excited about. These other games are just on my backburner. Games that people say are awesome but I still have no interest
Dat stream.
DER IS NONE
I liek the black stream
Hmm...wonder if I can get to 350 before the release date. 9 days left, and I'd need 33 hours...that'd be around 3.5 a day.
G'night everypony, i'm falling asleep
Cous recommends Fallout 3 as my next game. Says a good 90 hours in it.
night GuntherDW
Skyrim... ive heard it defined as Fallout with swords... but i also heard Fallout described as Oblivion with guns so... *shrugs*
i meen Gunthler
gnight Gunthler
0,14later Gunthler
night Gunthler
And now I watch my fave episode of Brave and the Bold~
Well I played a good 5 hours into Oblivion but didn't care for the combat. But Skyrim I loved to death.
Midnight_Tempest: to be fair the development was oblivion->fallout->skyrim
also, It's now my goal to break 500 hours in Pokemon White before White/Black 2 releases in the states.
I just love mountains and dragons *cough*
0,14is it the Birds of Prey one, LadyCanary
they refined the combat for skyrim, thats why its so good
SANDVICH TIEM, brb
I'm going to breakfast. Laters!
0,14also, sounds like a CHALLENGE, RAWRity
SaxyPretender: Actually, it's the one with Huntress and Blue Beetle (<3)
0,14later BritishBrony
mfw bethesda makes a Fallout Canada... that would make me gasm...
Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle to be exact <3
Fallout 3/New Vegas taught them so much about what gamers like, that why Skyrim is what it is.
Robot mounties:D
^ yes
It is a little odd that I have tired out on doing nothing. Maybe I should go spend another 200 hours trying to find another job.
LadyCanary: You know, it's a shame what they did with Jaime after the New 52 reboot.
i approved of Robomounties
I didnt read it yet, RAWRity.
BUT I did read Animal Man's.
In the Fallout lore the USA annexed Canada
LadyCanary: well, he now keeps the Scarab secret from his family and friends, and there's lots of brooding about how evil the scarab is, and how he has to fight it for control.
How was Deux Ex Human Revolution?
....WHAT?!
I never asked for it
I loved how he didnt keep it a secret. His family was so awesome and accepting of it.
LadyCanary: eeyup. They gave Jaime a gritty reboot.
0,14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
in all the Fallout games, its taken place in what is left of the States... i would like to see a Fallout in another country... or continent, that would be interesting
0,14stupid grim and gritty
And plus.....Jaime is a sweetie :3
LadyCanary: I know! it was really nice to have him be open with his family about it, and actually have FUN being a superhero.
^
lol. Fallout in the desert. I'm sorry, nothing changed.
I loved his relationship with Milagro, his sister.
So cute.
Hello there everypony ^__^
But no, instead we've gotta have a book where The scarab takes control of Jaime, and he bitch slaps Brenda into a car.
0,14...
....
WHAT.
0,14who's writing it again?
LadyCanary: that happens.
hi Polydunami!
But...
/me is confused as to what is being talked about now. -__-
For someone who has yet to play ANY Fallout games, I would probably just lose out on all the lore.
Indeed
LadyCanary: I know. It's awful.
TT_TT
play fallout 1, its pretty awesome and very different to 3 and new vegas
Why Jaime....:(
Well I dont have it. I have Fallout 3
use the pirate bay to get a torrent
Well, I don't really know how to and I don't want to.
Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free~
-_-
I rather just have my cous lend me the games.
thats Pony Placebo... not pirate...
Oh god...New 52 Blue Beetle is written by Tony Bedard. He wrote for part of countdown...
Ayyooo!
Hi Dismo~
Midnight_Tempest: Hmm.. Pony_Pirates?
a wild Dismo appears
Hey Dismo ^__^
Pip the Pirate
/me New 52 Deathstroke is pretty awesome
Placebo... maybe... maybe... *rubs chin*
Sudden fiction idea?
lol.
:D
Ah Slade Wilson <3
n_n <3 I love you guys. <3
wub wub
Dat Dubstep wub.
I'd love to read some Titans comics so I can learn a bit more about his daughter Ravager.
I'll figure it out. I just got back from my cous telling me how his wedding went in the Phillipines
untz untz wubwubwub
I don't see my husband. :I
http://school.failblog.org/2012/03/01/homework-class-test-load-damn-you/
Ohshit, There he is
/me hugs Dismo and LadyCanary
/me ish hugged
/me someone should stream "Under the Red Hood" sometime
I never saw that D:
Phase4: I realized the other day that my university has it's own Memesite. LOL
/me hugs Tik
Dammit. LOAD
Placebo: lolwut?
thats awesome
Ikr?
also something to avoid: Red Hood and the Outlaws or whatever it's called.
0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I'm just not happy --- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk
/me the movie was pretty damn awesome
Never heard of that.
0,14yep
....
NO.
wait... wut?
0,14and that had the same misfortune to be release along Catwoman
Anypony wanna come play Tf2 LfD2 or Gmod with me? Or Saints Row 3. On steam, Of course.
DeadpoolDash: yes, but she also was actually capable of having emotional connections with people, and her sexuality was part of her personality. Now she's basically the to flash cleavage and taint.
Okay, RAWRity, that is way too contrived for my taste
hmm... i shoud get back to killing everyone in the Mojave... lurk mode... ACTIVATE!
I mean, WAY too contrived
RAWRity: I am sad now. TT_TT
hmm feel the power http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBSpcS0tXv4
/me most female characters are like that in comics, especially DCs
SaxyPretender: ah yes, Catwoman, where for 5 pages, we don't even see her face. Plenty of shots of her cleavage and ass though. But out heroine's face? who needs it!
....
/me rages.
Dat Canary rage.
Nothing is more frightening than a raging canary
0,14yep
^
0,14also, oh hai GabeMoist
^
Ohai Saxy
/me randomly begins to pick a happy pic
DeadpoolDash: In the hands of poor writers they are, but there are tons of strong female characters in the DC universe, and comics in general, but often times get relegated to fanservice because the editors are convinced that the way to be succesful is appeal to teenage boys who only want explosions and tits.
LadyCanary: c: Calm down, We shall be wedded soon.
Is LadyCanary gonna have to dropkick a bitch?
...yes
flutter_spin: *boop*
Dismo: My heart belongs to Ollie.
LadyCanary: ollie?
Oh, heating pad. How glorious thou feel.
Dang it, I want to poke Luna's snout now. SO CUTE
Green Arrow.
LadyCanary: ;-; .... Pshaw
LadyCanary: ah.
/me the characterization of the Teen Titans in the animated show never really matched up with their comic counter parts, since the animated series were actually Teens not Young Adults
Oliver Queen.
Who?
I hope to find an Oliver Queen of my own someday ^_^
But Teen Titans was a good show on its own. It may not have held the comic-style but it definitely was good story telling
Green Arrow, Placebo
Who?
Hey yall
LadyCanary: If it's any help. I really like the Green Arrow :c
XD
Dismo: I'm afraid you'll always just be the Speedy to her true Green Arrow
:~;
D'aw RAWRity.
I used to like LadyCanary, then I took a green arrow to the knee.
we need a stream
/me she was a model in the old comics and was often drawn nude back then
DeadpoolDash: dem /me's
though trust me, you don't want to be Arsenal. It doesn't end well.
0,14oh boy
0,14THAT can of worms
/me me me me me me me me
DeadpoolDash: yes, but she still had an endearing character to back it up. Now she's there to just be a sex pinup.
Which dissapoints me.
SaxyPretender: which worms?
/me what did you really expect from a reboot, something good?
0,14what happened to Arsenal
She's a strong female character. Hell, she even partnered with animal man at a certain point.
Are we talking about female super heros?
Because really, while I'm not a big fan of fanservice, if there's good writing ot back it up, then I'm fine with it.
Placebo: yes.
O.rite.
Sex appeal.
Quite.
SaxyPretender: what happened? and who/whats arsenal?
DeadpoolDash: Yes, actually. Seeing as there HAVE been good titles to come out of the reboot.
0,14Arsenal was Green Arrow's sidekick
Female SuperHeros? ;w; LadyCanary Is my saviour~ :I
Same here. Fanservice for the sake of fanservice really doesn't do it for me
0,14who had a pretty sweet life
0,14he had a daughter, kicked an old drug habit and was an accepted super hero
Arsenal is Green arrows ex sidekick , gone batshit crazy and drug addict
.///. O-oh my Dismo.
and then Cry For Justice happened!
0,14until one comic
Dat blushing LadyCanary :3
I want female superheroes
0,14in the span of one comic, he lost all his good things
and THEN Rise of Arsenal happened!
I don't need superheroes, I have ponies.
0,14dead daughter, arm ripped off, and back to drugs
SUPERHERO ponies.
/me I only pay attention to DC for the animated stuff, games, and toys. Their comics have never really sold me.
0,14also, he became a villain
but ponieshave superheroes
Mare do well
/me I pretty much just do Marvel for the comics
http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrt13gBblf1qjqeiyo1_500.jpg Placebo, I did that with pony creator :3
Mare-do-well was a gambit
Seriously, Arsenal got kicked in the nuts with steel-toed boots.
LadyCanary: I've seen it. It was up when Wrek drew you :3
^^"
SaxyPretender: O_O
She is my waifu.
I'd say Mare-do-well has similarities with Batman
/me although both are quite guilty for one dimensional characterization of females. It just seems like Marvel handles it better or jokes about it.
SaxyPretender: the hell happened?
Who's a pretty pony? :D
I dunn.
oh! I forgot about an aspect!
Placebo: ;)
o.o
0,14Phase4: a bad writer and mini-event
makes sense
0,14well, I'm off to bed for now
At the end of the first issue of New 52 Catwoman, she and Batman have in-costume, on-panel sex on the roof of a building.
Because that makes total sense.
Goodnight Saxy :3 sleep well. <3

someone please
Polydunami: shhhh, gabe and I are having a moment.
/me 13is only partially looking forward to the weekend...
new pony ep this weekend
/me is looking forward at the screen
Shizuka: has colors even in the /me text o.o
I'm getting a whiff of hypocrisy here
:)
^__^
Placebo: u got kicked for mentioning *insert ban reason here*?
Justin Bieber is best pony

/me throws up flame shield
/me explodes
So you know what happened at the Oscars? Billy Crystal, in blackface, dressed as Sammy Davis Jr., called Beiber "The New Sinatra"
If I have nothing nice to say...

So nopony wants to play videogames with me on steam? I'm about to go on netflix if no responce.
beiber... the new sinatra... i dont wanna live on this planet anymore...
Dismo: What ya playin?
RAWRity, seems legit
Placebo: l4d2 tf2 Gmod. or SR3
/me decides he's going to divide the music industry by 0...
This prompted Tara Strong to order her 20,000 Twitter Followers to flame him. She has now challenged him to Mudwrestling.
Midnight_Tempest: And that's how JB was made~
but RAWRity, being a voice actor IS easy, being a good voice actor is a different sotry
sic
we could all be VA's... being a good one... that takes time and effort... T_T i wanna be a VA...
GabeMoist: no, it's not easy. It's still a shit ton of work, even if you SUCK.
Midnight_Tempest: no, we couldn't. We could TRY to be VAs, but 99% of us would fail miserably.
but at least we would have tried...
/me I would like to be a VA, but my normal voice is kind of naselly
wait....who's the 1%?
<_<
MLP VA's...
VAing is slightly easyer than plane acting in the acting part
>_>
But it's harder with the getting ones voice right part
MahBoi777: well, statistically speaking, we'd have 1 person here who's a decent VA
Less stress to it though
/me the good VAs have lots of range
I will say that Voice Acting is comparitively easier than on-screen acting, but it is by no means an easy job.
^
It's easyer than on screen as one you can the script
/me all emotes have to be done through voice, you can't eyebrow act as a VA
I could the script
I accidently the whole script.
Learning ones lines is always most tedious
/me just accidentally the entire script
GabeMoist: ninja.
Placebo, Pirates are better
Mm, I'm thinkingi Minutemen.
Or Spartans.
Space pirate super sentai are the best
Spartans
Pirate ninja minutemen from Sparta
^^^
Wait.. Pirate Ninjas? Or Ninja pirate?
Football playing king in space

They can be ninjas and samurai and mistics and are still pirates from space

*wipes tear* i know
Ouch.
Ah
13so no matter how i flip the mattress around, there's a perfect dent in the frame...
You can get those cheaper memory-foam things that go over the top of the mattress..That'd help
that sounds painful
Shizuka: lol I'm sorry it sounds painful but funny too.
13i should have seen it coming too... a metal frame with wood slat supports... in our summers...
Shizuka: have you tried sleeping on the floor?
dat super lag while tf2 loads
13i.. have no floor..

Has anyone had the audio issue with the Friendship Express DVD?
I' in the U.S. so that means that the people in British land are in the future right?
13i am good at breaking down problems... but there is no staging space for reformatting my room...
Shizuka: pile stuff on your bed, THEN start reformatting
13it will be a miracle if we can get the frame down at all to bring up a real bed...

I'm gonna use the things I've learned here in real life
Yeah, this is definately making me smarter than I was before.
my nostalgia has been satisfied for tonight, night all
PinkieSpice-- the truly sad thing is the actual COMIC was written very much like this at the time of the program. It was an age of Camp.
bye Midnight_Tempest
Sumica: no, i will lose the abily to have a logical disucsion and turn into mindless whinning with no reasoning
night Midnight_Tempest

humph
MahBoi777: aparently not, even when they planed to
00,10lets leave all barrles open.
it's a rule, lol
By God. That's the formula for Kool-Aid.
wait what?
about to be dipped into hot wax? time for chemestry, we need an explosion
If you don't leave barrels open, then how will you swim?
why would they have something highly explosive with heat with a factory that has big sources of heat?
00,10if only they could swing.
why don't they just start swinging back and forth to...y'know...avoid the wax pool
PinkieSpice: so batman can escape of course
I was about to say SWING U FOOLS, lol
its one of the things in the building code, all things must be bat friendly
00,10aime with the bat buldge.
they would but Robin is to young according to state law
He nearly blinded the riddler! XD
thats it
which caused them to fall into the wax, the end
it must be a world without safty inspectors

it looks like a flute.
00,10you hold them diffrently
Paradise92: The phrase 'you shouldn't have done that' seems to be a reference to a video about a supposedly cursed copy of LoZ: Majora's Mask. Look up 'BEN DROWNED' if you don't mind creepy things.
...
ok~ It looks real fragile though
dat hat
Stray i meant the dancing video

Ibelieve that "flute" is a variant of a recorder.

Dang, this really looks similar to FMA
That's the idea. The best MAD people can do amazing things.
That's the point.
/me finally remembers which final fantasy this is showing
the only final fantasy villain to actually acomplish what he sought out to do
Oh who am I kidding, FMA was published by the same company I think
that, too
Hello everypony
Hey there BronyinJapan, where are you from :D
00,10I love the one kefka cosplayer heckeling the sefiroth cosplayer.

Wait, this is Portal 2's ending?
00,10wish i could play somthing this nice.
I'm just wondering

yes
Yes, Want You Gone is the end theme.
/me fistpumps
lol do the Doctor Whooves message!

Jonathan Coulton played in my city the week that Portal 2 came out...I ran through the whole game to make sure I heard the song in case he performed it (unfortunately, he didn't)
I love this guy so much

Whats going on? :)
This is the Japanese otaku's national anthem xD
I gotta make sure I still remember the whole song so I can start a singalong of it at ACEN in 8 weeks.
I remember my friend showing me this video
00,10Sad thing is I know most of the songs
Sumica here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHpkMiulH84 <--- instrumental version
Oh yeah, It's Haruhi Suzumiya
00,10what you dont like the niconico singers?
There's a lot more than Haruhi in it.
instrumental is nice repeatable
I know that, I've seen this show
*video
oh lol
i haven't
watched this
in a long time
I love automatic mario vids
this is really epic video
been two years since i watch this
HA NA SE@!
This is amazing! :o
These things always left me speechless
I remember when Super Mario RPG was still new
this video single handedly led me to playing all the games featured as part of this
00,10the video was rather epic even before set to automatic mario
okkusenman
this is Mario 3 correct?
I didn't even know what an rpg was and I thought it was Super Mario 64 for some reason
/me nods
Super Mario World
00,10mario world
And this is Super Mario World I think
Yeah
00,10uninstall uninstall
And this is hacked, just so you know
i should watch bokurano again
How do people THINK of these things?
Air Awesome Anime
I still need to get the last volume of Air...
00,10it's japan
I have DVDs 1-3 and the movie...
Oh yeah, I've never seen AIR but I've seen Kanon and Clannad
How does anyone think of ANYTHING? Don't underestimate people's brains, people.
00,10dat precious thing
imagine how much work this for this to be done properly
Polydunami Clanned made me cry
wistful sigh Key stuff
I still haven't watched Clannad.
:O
I've got so much I'm currently watching still...
I have over 550 anime DVDs in my collection...I've watched over 400 of them.
00,10How about some epic anime after this?
hmm i recommend higurashi to anyone who can handle the insanity of it
Clannad brought me close to crying
yes
if i remember correctly....each "screen" had a sprite limit, so this would have to find perfect timing to change screen to refresh sprite allowance
I just wanna watch Black Jack the surgeon for some reason.
00,10DCD shows that
Black Jack is awesome
i need another anime...currently watching Naruto,Bleach,Fairy Tail....but since Naruto and Bleach are gonna be going to a stop soon...i need something else...any suggestions?
PoseyPony it, have you seen When The Seagulls Cry its by the same people
00,10"God knows"
hmm no but i know of it
Paradise92 hitman reborn & one piece?
i guess i'm delayed by 10 secs
00,10"lucky star"
i have the VN
Paradise92 have you seen One Piece
I've never seen that
hitman reborn i've been thinking of it...
00,10Xenopetain
its pretty cool.
but one piece i'm upset a bit
I couldn't get into Reborn
yay xenopittan :)
00,10Age of aqueariaon
Yea, I don't have any good shonen anime to recommend....I'm sad that Bleach is ending in 4 episodes :(
one piece has an insane amount of episodes
yea
I know it gets better, but still
OtakuTom it isn't ending in 4 episodes
Sumica, think you could link me to the place that plays Black Jack the Surgeon?
Its really something you need to get into, yeah
RoseyPony, it's worth it
and the manga is way better than the anime
OtakonTom manga started the last chapter...after that it is the end of Bleach
00,10this is the place, just a diffrent streamer.
WHAT!
Whos seen Code Geass
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuq!
lololo tsurupettan
i have
Uh-oh
and about One Piece...i really hate it
i read to some part after the 2 year skip in the manga so yea i love one piece
00,10R3 is due to come out soon.
qeue spike nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
Anyway, yeah, I've seen about 3/4 of season 1
Gotta go bye every pony:(
And I've spoiled myself
Yea, I know the manga is still going, but the anime itself is ending in 4 episodes. It may come back once they have enough to run through the whole final arc, but that's actually unknown if it is.
bye
bye BronyinJapan
One Piece will continue to become stranger until it becomes completely ordinary.
the 2 year skips marks the halfway point of the story
Bye BronyinJapan
He's gone
/me is too slow
One Piece is just bullshit....i am sry One Piece fans but i tried to watch it...watched 50 episodes of it and still can't like it...
maybe cause of the way it is drawn
its all opinion
or i hate the characters...
I'm not into One Piece, either.
but something with One Piece i just don't understand
I wasnt a fan of One Piece either :\
00,10it has way too much padding for my likeing.
wait what?
00,10mind you I wont play the whole thing but it's still epic.
I am cursed to ALWAYS hear the 4kids dub while reading the manga...
hmm how about elfen lied anyone?
Didnt like that one. Too blunt
the only thing i liked about one piece is the marine war
I never saw that, is it good? I heard alot of things :D
Is it Monster? I loved that show
hmm it was interesting if you could handle the first 10 minutes of the first episode
if you like blood all over the place, you'll love elfen lied
Nope
o.o
hahah
oh HECK YEAH THIS
I was a huge Inuyasha fan :P
da.......fuq!
I watched the first episode only
elfen lied it's that brutal anime wright?
the little girl
REDLINE
0_____)
with invisible arms
agh dced
It was good but I didn't go beyond that
dogs are now dominant species?
its one of the brutal animes
yes
And Elfen Lied? I've only read the manga
if you read that that means you also read nononono
Hm?
first 10 mins of the first episode is the most gorey part of the whole series
what series is this
same author
Good morning fillies and gentlecolts!
/me is no longer away : Gone for 5 hours 46 minutes 48 seconds
Is Elfen Lied anything like Higurashi no naku koro ni?

Awww awesome, who is streaming redline?! :D
not really
YAY

Okay, I gotta go. See you later.

I'll stick to xp
i stick to 7
lolwut
I shoul be doing school, fuck that i have you guys
00,10I just finaly gave up on XP.
ooo mythbusters
I use 7 x64 seems fine compatibility wise
00,10it gave me issues in streaming.
can someone tell me why the chrome adblock wond fucking work?
l4d2 doesent work for me
really i have used XP for 9 years
pony_2890 : same here =\
00,10cause it's crome.
It's working for me no problem. I'm running Chrome, no ads whatsoever.
dr-whooves: same I just started 7 a year and a half...or was it a year
ago
compatibility issues when i close steam and you?
nope
00,10all the balls
only after i play l4d2
i keep getting the covering ads in the stream
bawlz
add block plus ftw
^
yea
adblock+ ftw
00,10yep abp rules
i have adblock
that's the problem
then stop using chrome
00,10adblock+ and noscript are a must.
I ran the Vista beta and loved it, then the real version came out and I had a ton of problems. I then switched to the Win7 beta and used that in place of Vista. I've had the release version of 7 pretty much since day 1 and only recently started to experience crashes.
well i still have the old old issue of closing explorer process while playing old games
my firefox wont work
keeps laggin =\
chromr sucks with adblock
i wouldnt be using chrome if it did
fire fox ftw
connection issues alll the t
mine is smooth and installing win7 is fun
ime
so fast
i dont like chrome
ow for
-____-
i use firefox for addon compatibility....eats alot of mem tho
i think you can costumize ff better
not a prob though
I like Chrome more than FF. FF is always real slow for me, even with almost no addons.
i like XP its been stable for years if you have an older OS or a touch pc then go for it
i dont know why im watching this on my tiny ass computer screen while i got a huge tv next to me
05i have the juice for ff to work fine, henceforth i use it
00,10same here
i have 7 pony personas
mane 6 and derpy
^
link plox
what one
my ff only has adblock+/downloadhelper/download statusbar and ankpixiv
link to derpy persona please
I'm on my gaming machine, i7 processor, 16gb RAM
what persona dr-whooves
cool otakutom
well thats kinda obvious lol even though 16g ram seems overkill even at ultra quality
doesnt matter GIVE ME PONIES
Even then, FF runs slow
yah8 is fine for me
no such thing as overkill

good point
thank you :)
instant pony
budget permiting of course lol
:)
I'm studying 3D animation and game design, I need a good computer to be able to run things like Maya and UDK.
welp, lessee if reinstalling solves the ff problem
:)
what graphics card do you have?
raedon 4350
I have 2 nVidia GeForce GTX 460's in SLI.
Nvidia geforce 560 ti
from MSI
i bet my pc is the worst
ATI or NVIDIA
i said nvidia
nah man ati
I'll be upgrading my video cards later on...probably a few months after I build the new rig. I want to upgrade my MB, CPU, and RAM first.
id love to have a nice rig but im poor as shit
i want a pony game on steam
00,10Frys is your friend.
I'm an nvidia guy. I've never had any luck with ATI.
yea
Fry ftw
nvidia gave me nothing but trouble
I can't wait until Fighting is magic is finished :)
^
are there any pony games tho ;o
never played it
i kno fighting is magic... but
Fry's is okay, but I use either Newegg or Micro Center.
are there any pony games? apart from flash games?
00,10saw some kinda harvist moon game the other day.
00,10the text sound I hope can be turned off.

fair enough
00,10best pony is any pony on screen
I want to start a Pony game of my own...there's one genre that I haven't seen anybody work on yet, and I think it works well for MLP.
why is there mythbusters? :)
00,10Dateing sim?
lol, no
Party game!
with pinkie pie
why shouldnt there be mythbusters :)
00,10Mario party with ponies? I am ok with this
lol :P
Pony party
Rainbow dash always dresses in style
Exactly! I think MLP is perfect for that genre.
Tons of different minigames
00,10just think of the minigames
i want a portal to equestria instead
I think story game would be better
pony_2890 : you should talk to pinkie pie.. she knows about portals
dear pinkie pie break that 4th wall allready
The first one I thought of was "Don't Feed the Parasprites", where you're supposed to keep the Parasprites from food at the Cake's Bakery.
00,10damn you gravity!

00,10Raiders of the last ark and mechete

Ohai everypony
episode 16 of season 1 is one of my favs
Hey jim!
everypony post teh video that made you a brony
lesson zero is best ep
Lesson Zero was great
I wonder what's happenin ghere
a guy at work became a brony after watching epic pie time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmHAqgAFt6E&list=FLKxc4d-U5bwOqNckVNSYmEw&index=7&feature=plpp_video ,this was mine
00,10Antholigy got me intersted enough to watch the first eps.
Anthology*
^
00,10it's 6am, fucks are not given.
Think it was http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVCFV7jT9ho this one i belive :)
Screw your 6am
I'm in kangaroo land
Lesson Zero is awesome but Twi's insanity @ S01E10 was priceless
This isn't working.
I think my favorite episode has got to be the one where Fluttershy is babysitting the CMC. Her squee when telling them about the Shh game made me the happiest brony ever.
yaeah aus brony
00,10Vegas woo.
winter wrap up is best one
i watch episodes 1-13 in season 1 just research. Didnt start liking it until 16
Omg the squee is the most awesome sound in the whole world :D
i have downloaded all episodes
i became a brony but idk hao... just watched an episode coz one friend of mine from steam is a brony
Objection! Find a pet is best!
i love that choker she wears :o
but english s1 has terrible quality
who bought the dvd?
i dun dl episodes but i ve watched em all
hasbro would block them
this makes UP seam realistik doesnt it
so i can still watch em
00,10now put her outside.
^
How old is everypony then? wondering :>
If anything, it'd make Up seem more UNrealistic. 3500 balloons to just get a 44-pound girl to float.

it was sarcasm
24
15
13
I'm 14 :D
I NEED THOSE CLAWS

So awesome
00,10best way to pop them scotty

But apparently Twilight is the only pony to have the common sense to wear a helmet!
and dj pon3 when it comes out to go with my turntables
Cool. Can't await the new Stream tomorrow.
I fact, her helmet not only has eyeguards, it ALSO has a little hole for the tip of her horn.

They can see it so...It's not a black hole?
Pinkie Pie is everywhere.
nugget21 ok i see she kills with 1 move but they can't just let it like this no one can beat fluttershy that way
Cobellanez: You can see what's being pulled into it
You can't see the actual black hole.
But she only reveals herself when it would bring about the greatest smile.
Moon base alpha?
Light doesn't escape it
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9 Yay emotes
Its a Pinkie Hole? pfft. Sry, that didn't sound right.
You can still see what's being pulled into it.
Black holes, only viewable when interacting with something.

Also sounds of the doors from Doom
THIS IS A SPACE HORROR MOVIE!

Tardis, gone? impossible!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6T2OJZ4t-s&feature=related <-- Someone needs to combine this audio with ponies
hi everypony how are you all
I whish I had a tardis Id travel in time to watch the new episode
^ this
Oh god I remember that
Were great Fluttershy
Lawl
TARDIS is more technologically advanced than your silly magic black hole orbiting asteroid.
i'm good F1uttershy
If I could travel in time.
Watching a TV show would not be on my list of things to do.
Ever.
^
even if it was ponies?
not even mlp :o
dat music
I think I would probably forget ponies even exist.
:(
If I had a time machine.
I'd be tempted to first, get massive money through shenanigans, and then get a super-powerful future computer for gaming on.
go everywhere yaaaaay
but you don't, so therefore poni poni poni
Assuming I could get past the burning hatred I have for time travel and don't just destroy the time machine first.
Yeah Jim.
XD
^-^ I Would learn tomorrows lottery numbers get the expasion pack for skyrim and get every ep of mlp then destory the time machine
If I had a time machine you'd never hear from me again.
Sorry can't hear you I'm playing pirate with Blackbeard.
suddenly, abrupt music stop
And this is according to EST time right?
First thing I would do with a time machine is go to the future, get technology to fix all the shit that's wrong with the world today.
/me whispers: "Do you have any milk"
DOOM
If I had a time machine I would have a time machine. ._.
Doooooooooooom!
Meanwhile we'd never heard from you again? really? you wouldnt go back intime and instate yourself as a god?
imps, imps everywhere
dat doom sound effect
^-^ Arnt you nice Dari thinking of others
D< I would use It to Kill Sopa !
I would build a time machine and then go back in time and give it to myself *mind blown*
am I the only one who finds it funny that this ep is a better representation of Doom than the movie was?
nugget21 : how you plan to do that by time travel?
then you wold have two time machines!
KwakLad: What a dull idea. I could do anything I wanted in all of time and I'd go back far enough to set myself up as a deity? foolishness.
Casual converstation
The best and his armies will rise from the pit to make war with God.
If I had a time machine...paradoxes, paradoxes everywhere.
beast*
Dat "best"
Go back in Time and Kill the people before they even think of the bill :p
Rawr
perfect way to fuck with your clients
DOOM!
killing is wrong :o
dat casual horror
...Uh...
LOL
He is awake.
and so the creepyness begins
Cthulhu ftagn.
SATAN
I'm just awkwardly sitting here wondering what the heck is going on. XD
I'm a clown.
LETS PLAY SOME DOOM WITH THE DOCTOR!
Meanwhile sure, you have a time machine, you cant do everything fun that ever existed all the time because there might not be enough fun stuff to fill the rest of your life time
It's right behind you. Do not move. Do not breathe.
lol
also Meanwhile isnt it 'foalishnes' not 'foolishnes'
SLENDERMAN

And now he is going to die!
