wouldn't it make more sense to have it gradual?
:D
CrimsonPhoenix: it would
twilight_sprinkle: cashieoh-wan lol
00,10so is the rest of the world still useing that crazy metric system too instead of useing standard?
Sumica, imperial
Who takes their milk in anything other than pints?
Sumica: metric system is best system
and metric makes more sense too
dafuq is this cantemetor
Milk bags are the best system ever
anyway what's everyone doing cause i'm bored ?
00,10if metric is so great then why dont we use it for time hmmmmm?
Sumica, why don't you use Imperial for time?
IN CANADA MILK COMES IN BAGS
00,10dafak is Imperial?
the "normal" systme
00,10you meen standard
I'm sitting around
11,01You are Sumica.
maybe right now it would be.....9 feet and 8 inches
As always...
/me Has no life
StinkomanFan, fun thing is that's true
Imperial is inch, foot, yard, mile, etc
This SHOW man THIS SHOW
Same
I LOVE IT
okay *claps hands *bleeds* quistion 2: what non-nintendo character would you want in super smash brothers
Just sittin here
*hoofs
08,01imperial is scky
flutterchu: sora
flutterchu Travis Touchdown?
or any Namco characters will be in
flutterchu: sora and i will be happy lol
Zero from mega man X
no one else from any other company
I use a weird mixture of both
flutterchu: Deadpool
Sumica: it isn't called 'standard'
The only thing that I really do that is productive is I draw stuff sometimes
CrimsonPhoenix: pac man has announced to be in the next game?
it is called 'imperial'
CrimsonPhoenix: there were some FF characters in that shitty mario sports game
Arcane he's already had enough, let X take the spotlight
Large distances imperial
bye guys mothers at it again
Small distances metric
flutterchu, Namco bandai is doing it
bye dynamo2814
flutterchu: Gooby and sora
cachi01, exactly
BUCK YEAH
and Namco is also that kind to showoff
so they WILL put cameo characters
Dken2021 why have them both hell throw bass in there
but then I'm British
Arcane touche
so we use a mix of both
but our imperial measures are different to US ones
afaik
Really?
or I change my name for Pinkfluffyunicorndancingonrainbows
yeah
Gooby , Dolan, Soba, kaibi, ribu, mansex
Well distance is the same for us and them in imperial, surely?
that's why SI is so good
flutterchu: that would be cool
because it standardises everything
Best group cachi01
flutterchu, there's MANY problem with your choices
no, US imperial differs in several ways
him*
08,01except that imperial distances are *wrong*
which is why people prefer SI (metric)
I draw, but i want SAI since its so much easier to use.
it standardises everything
im saying what non-nintendo characters would be great in brawl
jimmy hopkins doesn't fit in well
parappa belong to sony
bye guys
aaaand Phoenix wright is just no
Bye FlutterMEDIC
CrimsonPhoenix: I KNOW
bye FlutterMEDIC
08,01Fersure: because everything should be in SI units
he's already being in one fighting game and he sucks
Oh snap
but living in the UK means having to use imperial
*i accedently pressed caps :'(
considering our roadsigns use miles
I just use MS Paint
I knew shygirl was trouble
It's to basic

cachi01, it is ... THE shirt
jeez this is the talk of the day
Methinks ye olde epic-chat may have died -_-
00,10Ryunosuke, that lack of research
THE shirt...
The shirt
Sumica - i wonder about that though...
well atleast the iron maiden font in the letters is cool
I am assuming it is the shirt everyone is talking about
:D Walmart - Like Equestrai Daily - isn't know for researching
In this section Buddha is holding THE Shirt
00,10lawl
I havent been to EQD yet
this was on the front page of reddit...

Backtracking.

OR SEA PONIES

MirrorImage: no
00,10spooky stuff, hmmmmm perhaps madoka.
Sumica: marble hornets pleeeeeeeeeeeeease
OR ELFEN LIED

I got some spooky stuff I have yet to share :) somewhere between now & Halloween will you get to see them
Sumica: search for it. its not an anime its a youtube series
cachi01: That'll take a while to view all the way through.
Silver_Soother: well it took me 4 hours
That's a while. Lol.
let's watch some jack skellington and the band of blind sighted followers

00,10hmmm, perhaps the tunnle

There's one in particular I found back in July, that I've been waiting to share just on Halloween Night :D
Marble Hornets!

00,10never heard of it
Sumica: I noticed you have a custom Desktop Pony, how do you get those?
HORROR
00,10oh fuck that then
13is a squishy dispenser
aaaw :(
00,10slender is over played so no
I knew Slenderman before slender *slips on hipster shades*
Sumica: this was made 4 years before slender was released
amnesia?
Silver_Soother: same here
How about THE TWILIGHT ZONE Sumica?
00,10dont matter, it's over played now
Squishyyyyy
As for that Walmart shirt - That shirt needs to be condemned!
cachi01: Sumica has a point though.
Hi everypony. I just made an extremely terrible discovery about the new pokemon game.
Tesla charge refuses to work, though.
Sumica: anyway its a good story. you should take a look at it sometime :)
13yeah keep trying it
hi Kawaii_icybeauti and what?
13one of the buttons in there causes everything to blow up and the other door unlocks
hi Kawaii_icybeauti what is it?
Kawaii_icybeauti - it's the same stuff they've been doing for the past ~15 years?
the fact that it;'s the same as the other 7 generations of pokemon before it?
thelonepony: You can no logner name your rival curse words. I tried to name him penis, but it didn't work.
D:
You found out that you could have download it instead of paying for it?
Kawaii_icybeauti: ...............
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I ended up naming him "Dickfak".
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO :'(
oh no, i can't name my rival LE DICKS XDXDDDXD
Old Dickfak.
:'(
what a shame
00,10but yeah the desktop ponys you just put the folder in with the rest of them to make custome ones show up
so looks like douchebag will die :/
00,10or did you meen how did I get them?
I know, I was almost crying. At first, I was going to name him 69, but Dickfak was a better idea
11,01Think I'll head to bed now.

Slenderman: nic cage

FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

AJIsAwesome, oh yes, the scary one

THAT IS NOT A ROCK LOBStER
http://i.imgur.com/pRiaz.png does stubborn as a mule rings you any bell?
ZUUL MUTHAFU---HEY
It's living in the fridge! You can't stop the mold from grooowin...
THats what my mini fridge looks like
all the repeted shots from different angles xD
I was partly right
I did guess he was a Mule
so the big bad monster is rancid lobster?
Just the wrong Mule
CrimsonPheonix, I don't think anypony cares...
Euuuugh........reminds me of rotten food
,O_O
CrimsonPhoenix: told u it was a mule
NOW GIVE ME MAH COOKIES
cachi01, but not exactly which one
Buytoast, it's a mutated being that used to be a Ganymede Rock Lobster.
O_O Imagine the smell
SPIKE CAN BREATH IN SPACE
00,10more aliens reffrences
CrimsonPhoenix: Does that mule have a fanon name?
How precise can you get on a character with no name CrimsonPhoenix?
StinkomanFan, explosive decompression
AJIsAwesome, good question
I would've accept the none taken mule or something
Or it isn't??????
just the answers were something like that mule in canterlot garden or cranky
So everything's back to normal? :S
NEVER LEAVE THINGS IN THE FRIDGE........

That... was FUCKING AWFUL
that makes sense
...........

well.......that was easy........
Talk about a lesson
reminds me of weird al's livin' in the fridge
AJIsAwesome: um....*sees Ed eat creature*...yes
FUCK THIS!!!
WTF?>
doctor_whooves127: Only cool kids will have that feeling. :P
yeah wtf is happening
this anime is so awesome xD
And next, the Bebop might reach the Astrogate to Mars while it's ENTIRE crew are unconscious... and broke.
A BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT!
MOAR BEEBOP PLS
God how long have I been here e_e
"is youre refergiator running" "yeah" "then you better go catch it" "BUCK NO :["
back to my fanfic :)
That... actually wasn't really that good...
And by entire crew, that includes the datadog
In fact, it was pretty terrible
that's the feeling when your in bronystate Arcane
Dr_Fumbles, what are you talking about? That was a hillarious twist ending
This anime is still awesome, it's Sci-fi action that has class (not that it is the only thing)
you don't know how long you've been here
Don't worry, that episode was non-canon :)
/me is not sure how long he's been in idle
Kandarihu: :S I guess...
So it was harmless? :S
so it begins
:)
thelonepony Well I got on here for the first time last night, So far i have not played any video games talked on skype or done any other important stuff
This was obviously the writers way of telling his roommate to stop leaving stuff in the fridge.
oh snap
AJIsAwesome, ultimately.
?
Much love for this. <3
yay
Oh
Kandarihu: Well that's interesting.
Weird Al heh
lol
:D
that's the same feeling i had when i first came here Arcane :D
called it
00,10big diffrence in video quality
doctor_whooves127: Just gotta love that feeling. :P
Yup... because when food is left alone, it becomes sentient
thelonepony well me and oni_link did have a pokemon battle xD
yup
sweet cowboy bebop
Just remember, don't leave food in the fridge
Welp, two different Doctors told me so, I'll believe it
00,10well it was a rocklobster from juipter
DerpyMuffins nah, I'll just stick to lesson 3
wish i could play pokemans, but i need wifi and the new black and white
IT WASN'T A MONSTER
IT WAS A ROOOOOOOOOOOOOCK LOBTSA!
Pokemon W/B ♥
oh i just got black version 2
oh man, I might get black 2, the other one doesn't have hard mode
I jelly
doctor_whooves127: Same here. :)
ROCK LOBSTA!
LOBSTER*
le sigh... Guess I'm just not a fan of Japanese anime... except Death Note, that was pretty good.
alright death note
13bleh death note
i want black 2 right now, but i has no monies :(
AJIsAwesome: Same here. :)
aww, I switched screens too soon - classic AMV!
00,10death note turned to shit in the second half
Never got the point to Death Note :|
Im going in the morning to get black 2 :D
Sumica true
Sabershy: Yay! :)
Shizuka: but death note is an awesome anime :(
death note was pretty meh from the start
13it was awful
waaaaah
/me Cow-boy-cow-boy-cow-boy-cow-boy bebop!!!
opening is boss
Sumica: What second half, the show died with L
L is the only reason death note is watchable tbh
WHAT?!?!!?!??!?!
Death Note was great
cachi01: it was awesome till L died
Till L died
13characters made leaps of judgment that no one could believably make
/me LYRICS Cowboy Bebop's a show that I like! It stars a bounty hunter named Spike! And this really hot chick named Faye! A guy named Jet who may or may not be gay
Another scary episode of Death Note?
I only said good.
i have to agree death not is meh
Swag up the ass intro
i beat u to it Arcane :D
00,10yeah 13 eps in L died
._.
13seemed like every episode was a retcon of the one before it
yea, I stopped watching when they introduced L's relatives
I suppose it is good ... if you're an emo ;)
thelonepony: yeah... i fucking cried liek a bitch
00,1013 eps later show ended
Shizuka: both that and it actually wasnt that clever either
Another scary episode of Cowboy Bebop?
THey were not L's relatives they were other orphans o:
hi eveypony
N and M
Should have gotten white though, seeing as Resh/Kyurem as a better move pool, but I don't own a Zekrom though.
Hi something
The characters in DN were too fucking smart tho.
Kinda silly
they were orphans. they explain how he met them in a movie called. ''L saves the world''
thelonepony r u a lone
/me Cowboy Bebop is now on the air!
Sabershy at least black 2 has challange mode
Ubers are not allowed in VGC so its makes no difference to this pony
Dr_Fumbles: at some times yes, and at sometimes they werent really taht clever at all
I NEED A COUGHDROP :D
^
what was the antagonist from the first White/black?
Are we watching this episode AGAIN?
Kandarihu: not the same one
hmm
this episode
twilight_sprinkle: True.
Oh, this episode is messed up in amazing ways.
N's father whos name i could not spell thelonepont
grape kool aid and jack daniels
i thought of lights big plan to kill L 10 eps before he did, the first time mia got captured, and nothing was preventing him from doing that plan that time
thelonepony Ghetis
sound good?
:p
Kandarihu: oh THIS EP......
thelonepny: N or ghetis?
how ya doing
N
hai something
ghetis
now i know :D
Hi, something. :)
last time i saw this episode....was on this stream :)
I was gonna go to bed, but something tells me I DON'T want to miss this
/me whistles and listens for echo
N was more of the puppet
I swear, every time Sumica starts streaming Cowboy Bebop, one of the episodes he streams is ALWAYS this episode.
StinkomanFan: Same here, bro
oh tis the clown ep
Dken2021: true
ajisawsome what is up
I fell in love with N ._.
Mello lieks chocolate
N was pretty cool
Only thing I remember was: "I'll take a potato chip, and eat it!" :D
Anyway, I'm probably leaving.
Night, all.
oh boy
circle man
Fuck it, now that I think about it, I hate all Japanese anime
something: Nothing much. :)
D:
Kandarihu: maybe it's his/her favorite one?
Dr_Fumbles: have you watched code geass?
twilight_sprinkle: No
or Fate/zero?
lol did u see the pony

MLG there folks
Dr_Fumbles: then watch it. its excellent. also ghost in the shell is quite good
Its really fucked up
I'll give them a try
PIERROT LE FOU.....i still can't get if it's the name of a song
i never got into Ghost in the shell
One Piece is a great series. Absurdly long, though
My Little Pony: Friendship is magic, I hear its a really good show
SUDDENLY KILLING SPREE
Kandarihu: Agreed.
pewpewpewpewpewpewpew
24 killstreak
Dr_Fumbles: ghost in the shell will take a lot of focus though, with code geass you can enjoy it both relaxed and focused
Seriously Arcane?!
M.O.A.B ready for deployment
wait
Try to edit it with a WEDDING
the Penguin :O
Arcane: Who the fuck would watch a show about ponies!?
HAX
Dr_Fumbles: IKR so fucking gay
Arcane: Ew gross, ponies........ <_<
car cannot block bullets but trash can can?
cheating clown
Dr_Fumbles, hahahahahahahahaaaaa... US!
twilight_sprinkle: I like shows that take focus
Combo
Dr_Fumbles: you wouldnt believe it, but there are these guys called bronies, who actually are huge fans of the pony show
6 Hit Combo - Excellent!

J_E_Smith71: that's what i said
Is...Is this episode really happening?
Dark92Enigma: oh god
Yeah but I missed it
You don't really think you'll win do you?
Too much action and no plot... so far
cachi01: had to pull it off
HEAVY IS OP! NERF NOW!
i was sleeping in during a summer afternoon though
MOOD WHIPLASH
screw grammer
Looks like a Micheal Bay film
NOT THE EXPLOSIVE NERF GUN!
Dr_Fumbles: but yeah, watch code geass, it has plot is dynamic, the characters are excellent, a lot of philosophy, and a very clever show, much more clever than death note imo
Dr_Fumbles: yes, but it has class......
Never forget Bob he is main character
Bob is best pony.
inb4 sb
:p
;)
6_9
twilight_sprinkle: FINALLY! I like good, clever shows. Hope its on Netflix

Well, the 2nd season of Code Geass has a pretty bad reputation.
Dark92Enigma: There is a women in a short skirt and massive boobs -_-
That bastard's gone and I'm STILL terrified
Dr_Fumbles: the first season is on youtube from the officials
Kandarihu: I can understand that.

twilight_sprinkle: Great, thx
Kandarihu: Spinzaku is in it though...
Kandarihu: the second season has a lot of plot holes, but it makes up with very interesting philosophies imo
Kandarihu: Don't spoil it

Kandarihu: i don't mean to be a jerk, but Dr_Fumbles never watched the anime, and he has to watch the series before having an opinion

nope
Dark92Enigma, good point.
Polydunami: YES!
flutterchu: not usually, its just a creepy episode
flutterchu: no
Hi, scout19_tf2. :)

Also, are you Canadian?
NOPONY SLEEPS

Dr_Fumbles, this series has more variety than just the creepy episodes we're seeing now.
/me SCREEAMS BLOODY MURDER YAY
Polydunami: Are you asking me, or someone else?
/me is just reminded of Oppan Bebop style
this episode was extra cool.
Kandarihu: That's good, I guess I'm just watching the wrong ones
I'd advise you to check out the classics, but Cowboy Bebop IS a classic.
STREAM IS BLOCKED for me.....not crashed.....oh wait is back on
I was asking you, Silver_Soother, because of how you call yourself :$
inb4 awesome sequence.

This is Cowboy Bebop?
lol wat
lol what the fuck
Gooby u Kll him
GOOBY WINS
jk, I've seen the show before
Sumica: i dont get it, how does the speed of it change whether his force field is on or not
FLAWLESS VICTORY
damn
what.
CREEPY 0_0
Sumica: Ah, so his field is only triggered by high speed projectiles/
granny made miss it!!!!!!!!
Death my Main Street Electrical Parade. Nice
DAMMIT
*?
00,10yeah
Gooby dusn gib a shet
Friendship?
Dr_Fumbles, I guess Mad Pierrot was a bounty head and the ISSP was willing to pay them big for his capture.
oh ok
Dr_Fumbles,
i thought he jsut always had his forcefield on
MOOMIN?
oops.
00,10other wise he could not grab things
Gonna watch it on Youtube, because i'm on my curfew
Sumica: I guess you saw that Stargate episode?
bye
YES
00,10aye
YES
Bye, Dark92Enigma. :)
Kandarihu: Oh, okay
i saw moomins
bye Dark92Enigma
Also, he was DEATHLY terrified of cats
he can fly though, and he has his gun inside his force field, it wouldve been better if he just kept his ofrce field on
This episode was really messed up
Kurra: ... ... yes?
always i mean
Maybe the ISSP will pay up... but to Space Land for all the repairs they'll have to do.
Kinetic forcefirlds were a major part of the novel "Dune", and the visual adaptations of the same.
I was gonna say who this man was and what he did. I forget his name >_<
Kencolt, I saw the movie Dune.
Kurra: Oh, okay, lol.
Was bawss, and Picard is sorta timeless in that eh.
Kurra: The book is vastly better.
As Jet put it in the first episode, "KILLED THE DOUGH!"
00,10but yeah a smart forfield would be stupidly complex
00,10it would need things like radar
the movie was still very intimate to me, and I liked that too
GTG, gonna be terrified for the rest of the night
night StinkomanFan :)
Night, StinkomanFan. :)
00,10hmmmmm

InB4 a cruising police car starts playing the music through it's siren, confusing the cops

Reminds me of an old box tv we used to have when I was a kid - the remote was sensitive - sometimes the when you turned the tv off via remote, it would turn back on a few seconds later - spooked me on several occassions :)
feur de lis isnt scary..
That kid has fucked up lips
Nothing says stop crying than prophecy from Revelation
That boy has nigger lips?

OH KAAAAY THAT'S SCARY

his lips scare me more than the whole wms
00,10Shizuka beat me

13no you aren't
Cypresswolf: In my brothers old truck, he spilled coffee on his radio. It would play Relgion stations (which he never regularly listened too). Even after we removed it from the truck, it would still be playing. Nothing worse then always having to hear Relgious radio stations while you are trying to sleep. :P
I ddint mean anything i think?
Kandarihu, quoting that in this makes so much no sense... @_@

Sumica: I'm feeling the dub is hurting =P

Um... physics?
What happened to Momoko?
Wait, that's supposed to be a redering of Beethoven?
Table was cut in half by a golf club.
Polydunami possessed
Official English dub = Parody... or is there a parody dub besides this?
Right
00,10english was done as a parody
This is the best ghost I have ever seen.

Animax did a more faithful (bland) dub, actually
Metronome of JUSTICE!
This is by ADV

this dub.....
can you make a computer survive aquatic conditions?
Why is there a shift button under the enter key anyways?
She had so many things she could say, and THAT's what she went with?
:D
NOO KENCOLT, I AM KURRA, SHALL RULE THE HOOVES

Cypresswolf: I use that button all the time.

FUCKIN BADASS JESUS

13not sure what i just watched..
i'll still carry her :3
Shizuka: Welcome to the club.
13soooo i'll be over here now
Shizuka: vice versa
Vordox: Improvised, although they "follow" the plot...
00,10it's a lets toss out the script but keep the plot dub Vordox
oookay
If this was real life, Jesus would have just said "Fuck em"
I never use the left shift - but hitting the enter button in mid sentence by mistake is annoying
more beetoven >:)
Sumica: That guy again then :P
this dub is brilliant imo
Dr_Fumbles, no. No he wouldn't
^
:( what?
^
Cypresswolf: I normally hit enter when I mean the hit the comma button. Not shift.
If this was real life the lord would have been like "fuck it just burn the world and start over"
so what else should we watch now?
Kandarihu: youre religious?
Arcane: YES, THIS
Arcane... no.
00,10pizza cats was another anime that got that treatment
Kandarihu: Same here.
Kandarihu: k, curious cuz not many around here
Im just Pastafarian
Sumica: It did?
Fuck religion! ... no offence...
00,10yep
Good Heavens, people, don't let this become a religious debate. We all know how THOSE go.
^
00,10just not as offensive

Buytoast: It's called "Feeling"
That's your opinion.
Try it out sometimes Buytoast :P
00,10like g1 old
Nostalgia, and it gets twisted when he sings the English dub theme to Digimon. Then the nostalgia is lost when he sings foreign language themes that I never knew.
it's called "Bad"
know it when you see it
Vordox: Don't try, he's a 4chan frequenter.
Scooby-Doo...my childhood... :')
This is another old one
That's called "your opinion".
Kandarihu: this
Scooby doo used to be good
Kammerjunk: So? He's still a human =P

Buytoast: Why? He loved it so much he like to sing it =P

Chip n Dale is part of my childhood
Night, Sabershy. :)

Vordox: I think buytoast is jelly of this guy. :P
Buytoast: Humans generally are.

Strangest Cartoon Disney Ever Did.

Gummi bears... :S

Buytoast: There, I have to agree (Ray Willam What'shisface).
now I want some gummy bears
Buytoast: So I ask you again, what have you to show the world with more views? =P

Inb4 Buytoast explode
I suspect when he did this he'd never heard of FiM.
oh man
Haaahahahahahaa.
the funny part is you're treating views as a way of saying something is good
he'd better not sing the g2-g3 and such
thisguy, he doesn't
good stuff can be overshadowed by crap like this
Buytoast: Money
g3 is best ponies
Buytoast: Also, edgy (adj): Tense, nervous, or irritable. I don't see why anyone would try being edgy.
Lol
O.O
I'll bet this guy did this in multiple parts. Every time the camera changes, might've been a point where he messed up and started over a little bit earlier
i hope i dont get a ban for that
Few remember the Little Bits - was the first anime I ever saw - aired on Nick early in the morning back in the day before I was old enough to go to school

i remember mighty max
When the heck did THIS air?? Action-packed! :O
I think I watched a little of this when it was new
Megaman X4 anyone?
Sumica: Nah, I don't see it.
Well, if it was an anime, it'd be Rock Man :P
Sumica: I don't see what makes you see that.
if i remember correctly DashWithRainbows hates everything
Sumica, really? thought i was the only one getting that feel
Enough to remember the chanting theme.
those intelligent lyrics...
Phase4: That's a shame friend. I remember watching this as a kid.
Damn straight.
I remember that there WAS a show

What was so amazing about it was that it addressed race and culture issues through the conflict between mutants and humans in the show

All the way to it's untimely end... yeah, I know it went on for a while

11,02Dinosaucers sounds like a cheap toy I would find in the toy section of the cereal aisle.
Back when Furries were acceptable
at least there was an animated movie
and this seems very familiar
theyre still acceptable.
So my good friend is getting lessons in kick boxing. This is what I had to say, "Kicking teeth in for fun and profit is the skill set you have been missing. Put it on all your resumes, and I think the employers will get the hint."
by other furries.
Biker Mice From Mars! :)
i like the other intro better
before I go. This show is AWESOME
^
but that show is old and gay.
Sumica: PIrates of Dark Water?

Hell, I'm not even a furry, and I still accept the buggers.

OH FUCK KILL ME NOW
Dang, I only know of the video game
I liked Speedy best.
00,10nope
I'm not old enough for this
00,10this was an anime
I WANT DEATH!!!!
Oh mai god
So random
:D
And I only know the video game because of Deceased Crab :S
really :D
oh how about speed racer
The Samurai Pizza Cats is dubbed by Saban btw.
One of my all time favorite shows. They never got scripts from Japan, just rough outlines of the plots-- so what they did was wing it and make everything up. To great success.
i had a crush on poly when i was a kid
please... kill me...
it was an anime but all the scripts were lost before they could translate into english
/me sighs
Wait, what, Cretor?
And yes, I watched this... shortly after I discovered Sailor Moon and fell in love with anime.
00,10yep AJIsAwesome
...nothing.......
:D
Sumica: :D
Yeah, Saban, you know...the guys that made Power Rangers, Masked Rider, Beetleborgs, and all that.
AJIsAwesome: That's Amurica for you. :P
not sure what i just saw
Sumica: Pirates of Dark Wateeeer!
I can't believe that show was supposed to be serious. :D
pizza means pie in ittalian
I saw gummi bears
dat Ponies47 :3
XD
Sumica, thanks
the original opening?
Original
dat orignal intro
nice
O.o
that's the original?
Okay this is the original
Of course... it's Japanese -_-
much better than the last one.
oh gosh, why did my brother show this stuff to me?
now we have the internet someone must have done a propper translation of this
/me no clue whats being said
Well, I'll be going now. School'n'stuff.
fuckin furries
Valedico.
00,10yes Phase4
lol
The original, Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, was just as silly-- but almost every joke was so rooted in Japanese Culture, history, and wordplay that an accurate translation would have fallen and burned.
Bye, Kammerjunk. :)
Using a cannon for faster travel?
Sumica, any good?
I like it.
See you, Kammerjunk
00,10never watched it
I'll take AtLA anyday
ah
same
bye Kammerjunk
atleast parappa the rappa didnt get an anime
Kencolt: But nowadays, you can understand it if you go into the Japanese Culture :P
dem kitties
why would he
flutterchu: It did.
dis
AJIsAwesome: okay
dis was awesome
Parappa DID get an anime. :S
Samurai Pizza Cats kept the base plot-- whidch they did have-- and just ran with the lunacy of the visuals, randomly made stuff up-- and iw worked brilliantly.
i haven seen any of these shows
i'd like to see dbz abriged streamed someday here :P
top left please
It was streamed before, thisguy
NO
I think I remember this, but never saw much
this was an awesome show
I vaguely remember watch this. But I'm pretty sure I watched it
jump out of a perfectly good spaceship
All I remember is the opening
I recognize this song
Okay... television was pretty sill back then
dat guitar
also, no on ecan hear you guitar in space.
<--- LOOK IT'S MACROSS
Lyra`: Like a baws
tentacles...

flutterchu: Actually. it did.
Tentacles =/= Hentai
^
Space Car with the top down! Nice!
... Touched artist man... Touche: http://derpy.me/YvdHM
That metal gleam
SilverHawks, really, was pretty much ThunderCats in Space, with a "SF" bent instead of fantasy.
Did you see that person that came and left a couple hours ago?
Ranned for 30 episodes.
Never dubbed.
Kandarihu: It almost always leads to hentai anyway
OohShiny, only hentai jokes
launch all zig
for great justice
00,10totaly not a show to sell toys
Inb4 G-Force kills the cat
Somebody set up us the bomb
I must say, this is good framerate animation...
We-we got signal?
Sumica: No, it was to sell an already popular PC game.
no
How are you gentleman
what a lame villain...
hey look a faceship
all your base are belong to us
Ima firin ma lazer?
I ws thinking it might be Exo Squad. Maybe not
o.o;
You are on the way to destruction !!
He/she left before I could say hi :(
YES
THIS
Thanks
I REMEMBER THIS
Sumica: My bad-- thouht that was a different show.
I'm not old enough for this...
I never saw this. But from everything I heard about it, I want to.
This was one of the things that sparked my interest in mechs :D
Always space battles...
am i the only one that doesnt know any of these shows?
Captain Simian & the Space Monkeys
00,10exo squad was one of the first eposadic cartoons I saw
AHAHAHA
No, superretroworld. No you aren't :S
superretroworld: nope
superretroworld: Surely you know atleast a few of these
:D :D :D :D:
Sumica, speaking of which, are there any numbers for mlp toy purches by bronys vs kids?
Mega_Milk: eenope
Lets base a show around the exosuit from Aliens
I missed the 80's
X-Men In Space! Seriously, looks like it
i know none of these shows
>.> Phase4, nudity.
superretroworld: X men?
that would be an interesting number
Yay!
superretroworld: Rusty
:/
except x-men
Panda|Homework, lazyness, cant be bothered setting up my colour script
YAAAAAY
YES
that can happen every so often..
<3
Mega_Milk: ik xmen
I mean I didn't see the 80's
man, bummer i was born near the 90s :\
THIIIIS :D AAAAAAAAAA
ONE OF THE BEST CARTOONS EVER!
Okay time for be. It is hard to walk away from awesome Sumi <<
Damnit
Phase4, I think its 1:4 btw
pirats of dark water
Night.
Night, Barbetos. :)
Panda|Homework, woah, serious?
this show ended on a frikkin' cliffhanger or something no?
i dunno
superretroworld: Then welcome to the group of people that watched these old cartoons ^-^
PIRATES
this is one ive never seen before
Oh damn i remember this
weird animation, but the dark water literally scared me.
cool
00,10it never got an ending
What?
I remember that bird! and that's about it from this show
80s cartoons bore me
This is more like it
How can that be?
they always end the same
Panda|Homework, if its seriously 20% of sales interesting stuff will happen
reminds me of "blood wake"
DAT POST :D
Cartoon Network kinda trolled their viewers about the lack of an ending
That is, not at all, Lyra`?
I mean, its only an educated guess based on region. but then again... and kid that buys a pony toy would be considered a brony.... no Phase4?
Sumica: just like what happened to my name is earl
oooh.
BRAVE STARR<3
I heard this somewhere?
They made an ad that casually claimed that the master of the finale got taped over by something pointless.
Cartoon Medley, OohShiny
Got to go to sleep...tally ho, everpony.

Panda|Homework, when i say brony i explicitly meen older audience
Night, VenHur. :)

Vordox, what ponified image is this?? :D :D
This.
it must of been in the 80s where there become more cartoons then ever
00,10greeks in space
Kingdom of Hades
lol
Why do I recognise this?
Panda|Homework, what i'm wondering is how many sales are occouring because of the older fanbase, because i'm betting it more than covers the cost of the talent needed to pull it off
then since the 60s and 70s
should have asked Kratos for help
Kingdom of Hades is so wroooong
/me slaps Panda|Homework around a bit with a large trout
what the hell is this?
and im kinda interested
Lyra`: Ullysees
00,10space jesus
except that i hate ANY 80s music.
^
lol
Whatever
Um... I'm beginning to wonder how old you guys really are. I thought I'd be the oldest, but I haven't seen any of these :S
Ulysses apparently is Xanadu.
I'm a colt really
Dr_Fumbles: the oldest person here is about 55
You're probably not the oldest here, Dr_Fumbles

GeeBlitz: System restore?

Either that or a record player.
Cretor: I have one too ^-^ but only one record -lol it was my old mans.

00,10orebots, transformers + voltron
ore, or war?
They
wtf
/me was gonna say something about ages but it'd never bring fruit. <_>

They're joining together.........literally.

Dr_Fumbles: windows 7

00,10cowboys in space
Galaxy Ranger?

Dr_Fumbles: i cant belive honeslty i stupidly got a virus
Cowbys.........IN SPAAAAAAACEEEEE!!!
FALSE
Cretor: Ah I have one of the first ones out. Crazy old. But surprisingly the sound quality isnt bad.
doctor_whooves127, space folding, perhaps.
*Cowboys
there are no black cowboys
Mighty Morphin Galaxy Rangers
i prefur rangers in space
GeeBlitz: Put in your 1st restore disk and follow instructions, you'll be fine. Just back up your stuff
Also, flutterchu, do you read Homestuck at all?
Yes yes yes!!!!!
this is familiar
Lyra`, not in the old west, perhaps.
this music...
working overtime?!!
there were black stable hands
Masked Crusaders?
Polydunami: pika....-p-pi
M.A.S.K!
GeeBlitz: How did you get it? Do you know?
theyre heroes!
thast about it.
*?
Sumica: Pole Position/Jayce of the Wheeled Warriors? ;)
mask!
mask~
Now, THIS was entirely to sell toys.
Dr_Fumbles: i didnt know it was a virus
Driving Lancia HF Evoluziones.
flutterchu: I'll take that as a yes.
where the things they change into are worse than what they started as!
00,10soon™
dont know that command doesnt start with a k
flutterchu whenever you get the chance, look up MS Paint Adventures. That is all.
Dr_Fumbles: so i downloaded a link my stupid friend gave me
Oh god
o.o
but homestuck is terrible
Polydunami: :(
Dr_Fumbles: he prob didnt know it was a virus to , it automatically sends the link to all my friends on skype
Opinions.
that guy with the ring is one of the green lanterns...
Mr. T?
00,10oh you got the skype virus
oh.
Bah. That's no fact.
it's like a never ending river of bad writing
GeeBlitz: Yup, thought so, you got the skype virus
Sumica: i almost got that
swing door in a rock face?
its a keylogger
POLE POSITION!
seems legit.
<3<3<4<4<4<4<44<4<4<44<4<3<3<3<3<33<
GeeBlitz: what was the link name? i want to know what to avoid
GeeBlitz: Many people got it
Again, opinions.
i had that game
i liek it's theme
This song. <3
strippers?
AJIsAwesome: opinions of what?
pole position sounds like a sexual thing.
but it's the trith
i had no idea of that o.o
NocturnalBlade: About Homestuck.
Cretor: *heroic strippers!
isnt that a videogame?
/me qualifies
i dont see any F1 cars
Not the truth, your opinion.
I've seen this somewhere, but still, I'm not old enough to this
Lyra`: i know right :D
The link was a ZIP and i didnt even check.
Okay. This is... I don't know. What the heck? I know it's based on a game that has none of this.
pole protectors!
not too much of a difference when it comes to things like homestuck
Based on a video game.
AJIsAwesome: i've been shown homestuck a couple times...its pretty funny lol
Is this cartoon supposed to be selling us on a game for something it doesn't have?
There is no objective evidence which suggests to me that Homestuck is terrible.
YAAAY GEM!
really?
outragous
NocturnalBlade: I still have to see it.
oh god
O.O
Er, JEM! :D
jem.
6_9
pole possion a show about stripers
GeeBlitz: so it was a zip file and not a web page link?
I LOOOVE THIS :D
More strippers?
they had this on the HUB for a while.
WTF?
/me sings along X3333
twilight_sprinkle: no
And this has always made me CRINGE.
does this air on the hub?
Lyra`: They did? :D
yes
When I was a kid, I didn't watch girl stuff.
I've never seen Homestuck before
Also rotoscoping
twilight_sprinkle: it was just a download
00,10yeah they still show it early am on hub
Kencolt: hey thats pinkies job
don't bother with it fumbles
Dr_Fumbles: Me neither, I hear it's very good.
It's more of a web comic, Dr_Fumbles
mo.o
it's a waste of time
GeeBlitz: it sends to a site and asks you to download?
<here
IT
IS
MY FAVOURITE
twilight_sprinkle: if you ever have a download a zip dont unzip it
<3
twilight_sprinkle: nope it just starts
Kandarihu: and now
JAYCE AND THE WHEELED WAAARIIOOORS!
And now I'm a brony.

Early 90s cartoons were the sweet spot.
I like it anyway
Sound quality sucks now though :D
mlp ytp
In fact, I don't mind watching shoujo anime.
Dr_Fumbles: i am running a Full system scan atm i am really hopeing it detects it
I think i have toys of this :D
Mid 90s were possibly sweeter.
Kandarihu: Inb4 Madoka Magica
Kandarihu: i grew up with sisters so i was used to watching girl shows, so it was easy for me giving mlp a chance
Lyra`: Actually, the Solar Sail is a proven comcept for spacecraft.
Kandarihu: Me too man
or koth. Im cool with anything.
THINGS WILL TURN OUT RIGHT
GeeBlitz: It won't
CHANCE KEEP ON TURNING, DON'T STOP FLOWING, THE FIREZONE!
Vordox, Madoka Magicka is not shoujo.
Dr_Fumbles: figured.
WHEELE WAAAARIIIOOOORS!
GeeBlitz: Norton?
who gives a little girl a car?
and why is there a wizard!
Dr_Fumbles: avast
Lyra`: Parents?
THIS DOESNT MAKE SENSE!
Lyra`: WATCH it! :D
twilight_sprinkle: just dont extract the files
Eighties, Lyra`
Oh gosh, I had a toy of those.
Prodominantly female cast =/= shoujo anime

Dr_Fumbles: if it does not find i am going to have to try to re install windows because i dont know the file name.
but they dont look edible.
Listen for the key change~
I'm pretty sure that Honey & Clover counts as shoujo.
um.......daehf
Dr_Fumbles: i am not sure is what i am going to look for
Yeah, Honey & Clover is shoujo.
DuckTales...
wow
Ah, Ducktales
sooooo classic.
im okay with ducktales
Polydunami: what about UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie?

Loosely based on the famous Cark Barks stories.

Nope

See, these intros were produced like.. like mini-movies.
Dr_Fumbles: im really just sad right now .
Cretor: im starting to read that book in english, how is it?
for*
the intro never gets old
:D
They were planned and staged and everything was seamless and put together to shine all together.
What's wrong, GeeBlitz?
Spin it let's begin it bear and grin in it when you're in it you can win it a minute when you spin it spin it spin it
yeeeeees!
and I seem to have broken my H key somehow - its not staying in its spot on the keyboard
http://static.fimfiction.net/images/story_images/14895.png?1347607335
GeeBlitz: Don't worry, you'll sort it out. It could be much worse
The Mark of Athena is out now... I think I'll buy it eventually
well at least I tried
I never could memeorize that last part. :D
That Talespin opening... it stands the test of time
AJIsAwesome: a virus keylogger.\
Let's get dangerous
GeeBlitz: Ah.
/me is out of smiling mana, all these great openings draining his nostalgia :D
00,10so did you find that picture yet Vordox?
I watched a lot of Disney TV animation
Sumica: I couldn't find the exact pic, but there's been quite a few Thirty Thirty :D
inb4 goof troop
i remember in my childhood seeing something really disturbing about tah mouse with the plug on his chest
cant remember though.
but it gave me nightmares for 2 days.
I remember when this was the absolute newest badflank awesome cartoon that ever existed in the entire earth
I think I still have some Darkwing Duck toys somewhere...
<.<
all them disneys
GeeBlitz: So, when you go to System Restore, what does it do?
Now some old school Nick
Okay. I don't think I watched this
Duckula?
I know I at least had D.W
Sumica: This reminds me of that series with "the trap door/Hatch"
Kandarihu: This is a British cartoon that was on Nick in the 80s
Dr_Fumbles: my brother already tried to reboot it for me
Inb4 Might Ducks
oh god
Dr_Fumbles: but it just cancelled itself
satanic symbols
tomato juisce
you know, for kids
thisguy: ikr
Necromancy......you know, for kids!
Dr_Fumbles: my full system scan just finish it didnt detected it
Dr_Fumbles: im screwed.
J_E_Smith71, well, I watched Nick in the 80's. At least when I visited my grandparents.
oh god
danger mouse
danger mouse.
Okay. I DEFINITELY remember Dangermouse
Lyra' are we going to watch ytp's?
GeeBlitz: You MUST set Restore disks when you get a new computer
Wish I knew this when I took that Sporcle quiz :P
And of course you can't have Duckula without DM
AJIsAwesome: do you wanna be a theripist when you grow up?
there's too many bombs in the intro
superretroworld: Nope. Chemist. :)
Danger Mouse is best demo.
Dr_Fumbles: im just so freaking stupid
dat music
And now some Bakishi and John K
This didn't last long, but I watched this.
Here he comes to save the Da-a-a-ay
easy way of telling how old a cartoon is. just listen to its audio quality :p
GeeBlitz: It sucks, if I was there, I could probably help you in a few mins
hold up
rewind
did you guys see from where he got his hat?
did he just pull that cap out of his taint?
darn it Cypresswolf u done ninjaed me

Wasn't this animated digitally?
Well, it's better than finding a LEECH in the same place xP
dis was awesome
I LOVE THIS SHOW!!
AJIsAwesome: oh, cause you always want to help ppl on here which is nice. therpist is also what im planning to do
I remember this, too.
and fortunately, I'm not old enough for this
GeeBlitz: Don't worry, there is ways to get rid of it
This show was AMAZING to me.
the eternal struggle wen on for longer than you think, it says :P
I remember the classic cartoons...
theres something cruel when they kick kitten toms ass
I remember this intro
I didnt much care for this show - I watched A Pup Named Scooby Doo - that was a catchy theme song
superretroworld: Oh. I'm just being helpful and courteous. I could see why you would think that, though.
super ted?
00,10GeeBlitz, short of runing a ton of scan programs while in safemade and offline you are rather hosed short of paying some one.
I never heard of this one.
pup named scooby doo was good shit
FUCKING RED HERRING
Oh man Superted
element x
Hmm, not sure if I watched... no, I'm pretty sure I haven't.
Buytoast: so true lol
Cordoroys!
Cypresswolf: I watched both. I found both of those shows terrific.
This was on Disney I think
.......o.o
what
Dr_Fumbles: dood thank you for your time to speak to atleaast talk to me
PICOCHIO!
Cloudsdale
Why?
o.o
SEEMS LEGIT!
........
00,10strange as fuck backstory
the shit?
ummm...wat?
:S
TED
LIKE THE ONE IN THE MOVIE!?
oh special powers?
wait ted
go to cloudsdale for super powers
AJIsAwesome: we are both therapists are bronystate /)
LOL
Now to say my Magic Word
hold up let me tear off my SKIN!
Okay here's one I don't know
this isn't Earthbound
BEST BACKSTORY EVER.
Sumica: i have tried many scan programs none detected it .
Vordox: research must be done
Lovely animation style :)
Definitely haven't watched this
ALVIN!
00,10ow my ears
WELP
Oh yeah
hated this show sooo much.
superretroworld: I'm not a therapist, but I'll brohoof you anyway. (\ :)
Oh god...
00,10same here Lyra`
Yeah Baby!
As much as going down the Nostaglic Walk is fun, I am afriad I must take leave.
Oh yes. I watched this so much
Back when Alvin was great before CGI
bye Silver_Soother
I really liked this opening
I actually LOVED this intro. :$
the actually decent chipmunks :)
AJIsAwesome: well on here you sort of are :D
Back when Chipmunks were cool - before those movies ruined them!
so this intro sooooo much lol
superretroworld: Oh. :D
Dr_Fumbles: brb let me try to look to see if i have the disks
Cypresswolf: PRECISELY.
GeeBlitz: k
thisguy: because the new chipmunks are too mainstream
00,10underwater smurfs
kids today NEED to watch this before they watch the current versions
oh god.
DOOT DOOT Dododo DOOT
snorks
this
the poor mans smurfs
thisguy: except for mlp right?
thisguy: Well they still sell the old ones on DVD
Never could get into Snorks, IMO.
This wasn't the main Snork intro
The one thing that all of these intros have in common is that they all are heavy handed in SELLING viewers the rest of the show.
that should be a rule. to have kids watch the orignal versions before letting them watch the current. at least they'll be able to know which is better o.o
I wish this didn't remind me of that Family Guy cutaway :(
Okay, maybe this isn't quite so bad.
almost 12:30...if I wake up late, I can always call in sick :)
00,10here we go
sea pony version of smurfs
This was the first Snorks intro, not the one I'm familiar with
TINY TOON!
:O
OH MY GOSH
this one was good.
i liked tiny toons.
YES!
a little?
"Swim along with the snorks, come along with the snorks"
It was. It is.
oh god...<3
I dont think I used any sick days this year
SO MUCH YES
ALL MY YES!
<3
Sumica: Talk about feeling older and older...
I remember this show <3
Dr_Fumbles: no i dont..
Pinkie's history
If this show hadn't come along when it did, I would've sworn off all animation upon my 13th birthday.
:D
there was this and animanics
00,10ikr Vordox
Yeah, I hardly watched the show.
:D
What people dunno is that this show launched lots of furs as well.
Censors? What censors >_>
GeeBlitz: Dang...
:D
Gogo! :D
I only played the Super Nintendo game
Dr_Fumbles: my desktop icons are acually still flashing...
Dodo was epic
And yes. This still is the same syndrome I mentioned
Cypresswolf: Not the ones who did the famous "Dirty jokes" of Animaniacs :D
How I Spent My Vacation was awesome
Kurra, this show is only a small portion of furries
00,10some one said animaniacs?
It's on DVD finally
Animaniacs
And this one
oh boy
i never could understand that dodo, meaning they really did a good job with that character O.O
<3
:O
<3
<3 oh hell yea ^_^
YES!
CrimsonPhoenix, indeed.
woot
This is a pitch higher than I remember.
IT'S TIME FOR AAAANIMANIACS
Dr_Fumbles: do you happen to have a skype?
Sumica I love you
:D
SO MUCH YES!
Just be aware that this opening involves a couch gag.
GeeBlitz: Don't beat yourself over this, the Skype virus got A LOT of people.
i like this show much more than tiny toons
this is not meant for kids, seriously
this show :D
OMG ihaventseenthis since i was like 3
Thank you so much, Sumica! :D
Kurra, but seriously the whole 90's made a lot of furries
This was my most favoritest show EVER EVER EVER EVER! That's like, 4 evers!
GeeBlitz: No, which is why I was spared
Sumica: The World Map Song? ;)
The couch gag was removed for the Nickelodeon version.
reminds me of nostalgia critic's top 11 involving animaniacs
00,10might as well
GOODFEATHERS
forgot the name though
they was ALOT of shows with anthro characters
This was basically Spielberg's attempt to see what the hell he could get away with.
The Skype virus is terrible, it even infected my friend's camera (Or at least made it so he can't upload videos to it)
Dr_Fumbles: mm
is it wrong that i have a legit lesbian crush on rita?
this video is proof of that
the voice actor of her anyway.
SAILOR MOON
United States Canada, Mexico Panama, Haiti Jamaica Peru....
Vordox: Regular Show has some great adult jokes - Im convinced some of the Animaniac censors ok RS
J_E_Smith71: camera?..cameras dont run on windows..
oof, rita <3
but regular show is bad
o.o
Woot?
ummm...wat?
Of all the things the censors got antsy about in animaniacs, it had to be Minerva Mink :S
wut??
oh god
00,10some one asked for it
kill this show.
Hmm????
And here's the Wuzzles
J_E_Smith71: you sure its not just the driver on his pc
Now THIS launched furs too :D
Something I've NEVER seen
I LOVED THIS SHOW!
:D
original doesnt mean better
twilight_sprinkle: I think it was the driver
Never seen this one..........
I vaguely remember... okay. I guess I was aware OF this show, but never watched it.
J_E_Smith71: k
autistic children with downs syndrome are original
They tried a bit too hard with this
Polydunami: atleast we still had Hellooooo Nurse
HEY GUYS LISTEN
doesnt mean theyre useful
Hippobunny 83
Well, yeah
HOW ABOUT WE
Dr_Fumbles: thank you so much for your time and i hope i get this fixed even if it means rebooting and loosing everything
GeeBlitz: I'd suggest calling tech support. The number should have come with your computer
00,10robot chicken killed that show for me
Disney's first attempt at Saturday cartoons
But Minerva was hilarious :(
teddy ruxpin
Used to love this one
Dr_Fumbles: if it comes to that i will
you mean gene splicing?
o.o
o.o...
oh hai Micker
Mickey**
OH DUDE THIS
I don't remember this one.......
I remember this! :D
Dr_Fumbles: bye..

Puerto Rico was a country back then?
I wonder if ANYONE learnt this inside outside
Rob Paulsen's so awesome he can sing this from memory nowadays
(Also they forgot 3 or 4 countries)
YES YES YES AAAaaaaa Sumica :)
Imagine the VA trying to memorize this
/me attempts to sing along
I could watch Animaniacs till I die
OohShiny: He still remembers it
Ther'es a live version of him doing it
Also, the United Kingdom is separated into three?
Vordox: That's awesome.
Denmark!
Eeyup. Yakko mentioned Israel. Inb4 Fatwah
singing spanish song while discussing other countries, your argument is invalid
Vordox: But imagine how hard it was for him to memorize, that's what I meant
I saw Rob Paulsen sing this song twice live at Anthrocon :D
lol
Perfect perfect.
I'll never memorize that seriously
Yugoslavia is no more.
It was a moment in time :D
almost 200 countries
why is australia second to last :(
i see how it is yakko.
you will pay for this.
woot more
now if only it could be updated
A few countries are no more. Also Lesotho was not included in the song because its sovereignty was in dispute until recently, I think
00,10there are a few fan lyrics to this to bring it up to date
Now another great one
lol things we never knew about the presidents :P
who said cartoons arent educational?
:)
^
ikr
00,10edjutainment
Sumica: yes but only in comment form, if we could get the original song writers and VAs then it would be awesome
Al Gore was President of the USA for about twelve minutes once.
Ryunosuke: At least Animaniacs made it fun
This show was never in syndication. If it was, it might be as lucrative as Carmen Sandiago
alcohol o.o
lol
Boo Woodrow Wilson
i wonder what they have to say about bush and/or obama
lol
who is yours?
Which one, Lyra`?
teddy
crappy edjutainment, at least the country education part
Lyra`: you forget theres 2
thisguy, Clinton was president when this was made
/me sings along
XD

I wonder what they would say about Bush Jr.?
An alternate line was "JFK he got shot"
:3
XDDDD
XD
is obama
Obivous why it was changed on TV
or mitt
so true
"i did not have sexual relations with that woman" >.> <.<

And they DID do that to the next President
>_>
<_<
SO true. :D
I'm not too sure if that makes sense..
so jump in ya plane and fly away ^_^
reasons im not voting for mitt: he looks like a man who says the N word a lot
oh this
On the album it was "The one in charge is plain to see, its Clinton first named Hilary"
this mother fuckers name is Mitt
XD
he
oh god
And they became the lapdog of the president after that
he blew... the wad
And now for the capital song
wow
"I believe that human beings and fish can coexist peacefully!"

Theres an utter buckwit in my class. He is 13 years old. And has smoked both Tobacco AND Marajuana. Oh and when I was in the toilets (crying my eyes out) a random kid came into the stall next to the one I was in. And he took something out of his bag and I heard a lighter and a few seconds later I smelt something kinda like tobacco but may have been marajuana.
Marijuana smells nothing like tobacco
TheRandomkid321: Why were you crying?
Okay it smelt like a legal marajuana type thing that my dad does.
and you would of felt the effects of marijuana
Hey Gold_Demona! Welcome back. :$

Mega_Milk: my bullies were defused by the lone fact I answered back to them :D
TheRandomkid321: Are you sure hes not just being...ya know...autistic...

no weapons...might end in an accident you never can fix again
My bullies were defused by me never seeing them again after high school.
MadSurge: Im black :I
He literally attacked me with a razor and gives me smug looks
MadSurge: So I got feared sadly....
o.o
in this case, the police should get involved

TheRandomkid321: are there others with the same problem? witnesses?
Whether he's actually using them or not.

DaringDerpy Tried it.
It's like Bill's opened his own yearround Santa Land
Again, try harder
My princible is an utter fuckwit.
get your friens and beat on him
TheRandomkid321: Well do you have any friends?
Then don't go to the principal. Go straight to the cops

if he does stuff like this, the cops might already know him
...did SuperBrony become Midget Brony? I thought he was streaming
J_E_Smith71: Thats a bot

Gold_Demona: Define rejects
I had two close friends, among us threee, we were already pretty well known among our school. I was a funny guy, my best friend was another funny guy and the girl was among the most talented in out school.
Mega_Milk: Rejects = Nobody likes you.
Gold_Demona: I was always the best male friend of all girls :D

That sucks.

Internet quote.. :3
AdamTheDuck: mhmm....
It's cool Mega_Milk. Everybody makes that mistake. :D
On this chat, anyways. :P
Oh good. The good seasons before everything got politcal.
Now that I think of it, I think I heard that quote from Klumzeedragon
It's pretty safe to assume everybody's male here. 9 times out of ten, you're probably right. :D
Although I haven't seen him in a while~

MadSurge, they're usually burried underneath all the regular stuff.
AdamTheDuck: you mean FPSes?

Mutterguy: what a guy
Ehh, violins might be a bit too distracting :S
where my sexy troll bitches at!!
You know what is easy listening?
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
no that's just slapstick
The sound of Jmo slapping people with large trout?
it hits hard though. .-.
Bingo.

Mostly he just slaps Ninjazz. :P

i thought u wubed me
;_;
>Tried
thegt90: for me too
only4ujaymoo
<3
c:
Well, the first thing I do remeber is that you hated it. Can't remember who the other person was though...
/me licks Mutterguy
no
Hate might not be the word. It was more "oh gawd what the hell do I do" moment. And did the name start with a G?
Denied.
Ok, I've been trying to figure it out, but it's not making any sense to me so I have to ask. What does ">" mean in this chat context?
:<
/me squirts AdamTheDuck with a spray bottle
Gold_Demona, it's basically a quote.
/me gives Mutterguy a cookie. :<
You are a quote Ninjazz.
:>
A meaningful quote? :o
a sxy quote
Ninjazz: So when you said ">Tried" you were quoting somebody?
ok...
Gold_Demona, quoting myself to be exact.
um.. can't eat cookies sorry :(
cant unlink open files on windows
ah
due to permison denied o_O
well night everypony need the sleeps
Gold_Demona, Mutterguy, and to think I've been trying to tone all that stuff down. =w= (I said "trying")
Phase4, wut.
ah
I see now. :>
Learning! \:D/
Now I know! And knowing is half the battle! \8D/
Actually AdamTheDuck you're ok. no humping my leg though
GEE EYE JOOOOEEEE.

Lol.
Mutterguy, I only lick and nom people :S
thelonepony, np ^_^
Goodnight thel - damnit

05tits.

Bewbs.
boobs
/me noms Wrek
Heard that in Morgan Freeman's voice, Wrek.
lolwut Ninjazz :D
i like how the function used to open, create, delete and various things on files is called 'CreateFile'
a boobie trap that actually catches boobies
sigh do i that to make ornithology jokes again?
i meen tbh unix uses open() to create files but it makes more sense than create to delete
Wrek: yeah, boobies! :D
So technical. /)>_<(\
Damnit Phase4, why'd you one of Aesthesys' long and meaningful songs >.>
you have to pick*
AdamTheDuck, XD
Wait. This is GW2 OST?!
it was top of the list
Seriosly?!

Ninjazz, nope
05no really, few things beat a nice pair of breasts.
Oh...

no obvious defense
Phase4, rape and pillage!~
MadSurge: lol, I've been afk to make breakfast, so I think I missed the insanity. XD
This reminds me so much of Oblivion.
AdamTheDuck, its just a little too good to be true
last time i did that, most of my fleet was wiped
And ohai Wrek! 8D
my fleet of like 8 ships :/

pre-searing, ah the good old days
i played "adventures in ponyville" with my commentary, which was pretty fun
Unless he means THAT brony stuff.
Oh.
LOL
Okay.
AHAHAHa
Carry on.
RoboGerbil: It does when you go to Bronystate. :P
/me nods in agreement to Ninjazz
Dat "THAT" :$

>_> <_<
You'd know all about that huh Ninjazz.

Jeez, Phase4, that's usually the point where people just give up and scream at their computer for not working right.
But YOU go ahead and get all detective on it.
Oh is Phase4 doing tochnologimacal stuff?
:)
Ninjazz, you have NO idea what you have to go through to make the kind of stuff i'm working on work
so what everyone up to today
the internet doesn't run on screams unfortunately

RoboGerbil, :S
Did anyone actually listen to the song I posted? :(
urgh

Gold_Demona: time may be a concer, but caring is another matter..

Eeyup, I got a steam.

Everything is running smoothly now :) `~
Phase4 A-Team one?
whats your steam i will add you :)
hey
think theres a googledoc that lists everyponys steam acct
guys
hi x1es
ew it's a XAX
OOPS
Mario 64 beaten in 5 minutes
Hello XAX
XAX yes?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTzs9bcNgMQ
Deadpool Dash
hi XAX
who all here is using google chrome?
XAX wtf?
I'm not on that googledoc
i use chrome!
lolgooglechrome
Phase4 what channel
I use chrome
Chrome is nice~ :S
On my PC anyway
?
I has Chrome
Oh my god I hate yuo all.
On my mac, I use Safari
you*
I used to use Firefox, but it got too slow and freezy.
I only use Chrome so I can customise my new tab... :S
Mutterguy: Despite that tab-fail of yours: Howdy!
Ninjazz, wut do u use?
yeah.. hi!
You say chrome and it's over.
i just use outdated firefox
inb4 Chrome.
Jmo, Hmmm? I just got back from making a sandwich.
LOVE IS OVER
/me feels silly now
anyone want to play TF 2
Wut browser do you run with
/me uses firefox 12
No more Jmo x Ninjazz shipping :<
y u no liek Chrome, Jmo?
Phase will be playing TF2 later
Do you know how much RAM that thing eats
Jmo: It's been my experience that ALL browsers nom RAM.
Oh. Forced to run with Chrome because all my bookmarks are on it. I'll get Firefox when I upgrade this stupid thing to Win7.
oooh hidden code
pfft, when you have 8 gb, 400 meg isnt much
4.6GB RAM was my general usage with Chrome.
Ouch!
It ate my ram.
I've never had THAT
Wat.
mario has some jumping skillz
4.6?
Just wat.
Yep
silicon chips are nomlicious
Swapped to Firefox, never went back.
firefox can eat ram too
Jmo: .-. u srs. I mean, I know it creates a billion processes, but srsly...
At most my chrome uses 50k in Ram
^
Must of had a memory leak or something.
Steam uses an average of 100k
As does Everquest
brony2447 Rainbowdash is faster :D
05time to get soem rest
But everquest is old as dirt. :P
Oh and Ninjazz, tis over. ;_;
05see ya starside
;__;
bye Wrek
Nacht Wrek.
Toodles Wrek
Enjoy thy rest Wrek
Bye Wrek
g'night babby Wrek :3
I don't know how many times I've linked this, but this is why I like Chrome :P http://i.imgur.com/WIbqg.jpg
Bye Wrek
later Wrek
y u no creating directory
right now my steam is using 63 mb, firefox using 344 mb
Jmo, when will the magic resume? ;~;
When you finally get your ass on Firefox.
My chrome doesn't do that, AdamTheDuck. How do I make it do that? WIth the little boxes and stuff? D:
my steam is using like 50 and my firefox like 300 :P
When I upgrade this POS to Windows 7. >_<
ouch. that's a bad way to end a relationship
Replace Firefox icon with spitfire GO!
stupid php
it silently replaces non existant object attributes with null
;_;
Gold_Demona, umm, can't remember what it was called...
i cnt stp wubbing u ninja
so you can do the wrong thing and it wont tell you
<3
Gold_Demona, something "dial"...
Speed dial, I think
Sounds right
i has ninja on my sped dial
brony2447 :D
cuz he is sxy n speshul
Safari on my Mac has soemthing similar, but with MUCH more boxes.
brony2447 eeyup!
we should really get a big mac emoticon
my alienware is amazing till you fill it full of crap :P :D
Gold_Demona, you can add or remove boxes with this.
..Alienware
brony2447 Easter ggs!
eggs*
AdamTheDuck: It has a set number of boxes. Whatever boxes you don't pin with your own bookmarks it fills in with recently visited websites.
yes they do gaming laptops and computers with amazing ram and graphics
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That's a good joke.
Gold_Demona, that's strange, when I add a box; it asks what website you want in the box.
my brother has a gaming laptop
uggh why do i always get these terrible headaches when it rains :(
:/
AdamTheDuck: It's a different thing. You don't add the boxes. They're just there.
/me assumes Jmo is a guy but can't be sure
yeah they a good awesome
Gold_Demona, oh right~
LOlLL
*rain
Awesome and Alienware don't mix.
Neither does gaming.
AdamTheDuck: And if you want specific boxes to go to specific sites, you tell it what URL you want it to be.
Alienware is a joke.
my other assumption is Jmo is a 15 old girl
AdamTheDuck: Instead of the recently visited URL that was put there
yes, brony2447?
brony2447 nahim not even listening to anything
I'm a muffin Mutterguy
Rain, You give me head aches! :D
Rain: lol srry i made a typo in a sentence about actual rain my bad
You're a muffin, Jmo? What flavor? :O
lol
really
ok that's now my mental of you Jmo. blue berry or chocolate?
Gold_Demona, I just wanted more space to look steampunk Octavia so I installed that thingy so that I only add the boxes I really need :$
Whatever flavor you desire.
so I can look at steampunk Octavia*
I'm the magical muffni.
muffin^
/me noms Jmo because he is muffin
why do fraps files have to be so big T_T
AdamTheDuck: Well, in my case, I need the 24 boxes that are on the screen. I have THAT many websites I go to. XD
I can't eat muffins for the same reason i can't eat cookies
One of those boxes is Bronystate, of course. :>
fraps isnt compressed
12.4 gigs, DAAYUM
you have to compress it youself with a seperate program
Perfect
Sony Vegas4lyf
little bit of polish is needed
Hey Bronystate are you buying Halo 4?
but this is working
hmm steampunk in space sounds interesting
DeadpoolDash: ik i use WMM
lolhalo
Spacepunk?
RoboGerbil, that would be cyberpunk I believe.
dam right HALO FTW :D :D
dat massive error
AdamTheDuck: nah cyberpunk is like ghost in the shell
just saying that is why fraps is big, because it is raw video
Still has that sci-fi look
w-w-what's wrong with Halo Jmo?
yeah fraps is pretty cool
Halo is a milked franchise that needs to die already.
Almost completely perfect
and steampunk is awesome
Jmo NO
So spaceships that run on steam?
Jmo NEVAR
Same goes with Call of Duty.
:3
Gold_Demona, seems legit
Good morning :3
Jmo, you have a point there. Halo 3 was supposed to be the last.
AdamTheDuck, you there?
Gold_Demona: thats a start
Exactly
Phase4, eeyup.
just checking
Gears everywhere
Oh, jeremy soule worked on morrowind didnt he
yes
i was wondering
and skyrim
yeh lots and lots of gears, but i think that has its own designation
lol everyone down in texas (at least where i live) says eeyup its awesome
this sounded very much like tes music
and oblivion
Oblivion was a bad ass game
Phase4, irk. That's what I said a while back.
yeah halo 3 was but they left it open and 343 where fans now they own the franchise and they love the chife so they brought him back :)
ikr*
BoroBrony: not completely
maybe more like arcanum?
I played oblivion till i got head aches <3
Point stll stands, needs to die.
Burn it with fire.
true
NVIDIA!
BoroBrony: they still have o'donell doing the badass music :)
Y YOUR SOFTWARE BROKEN
Halo was good, but it should have stopped at 3.
^
Phase4, fuuuuu I'm on my laptop
dam right they do y get rid of him
ODST/Reach was just stretching it.
But they had to tie in all the story lines for halo
ODST was bad
reach was a very polished shooter
ODST was boring
didnt feel like a halo to me
Reach had a nice ending.
ODST had its charm
I personally stoppping liking Halo at the Halo 2.
^
AdamTheDuck: eeyup....everyone dies :|
reach was cool i still play it on my xbox
ODST was a Disney Experiment. :/
Ahh I remember the old days of playing on xbox classic.
ODST reminded me of Halo 1, cause you could die easy if you werent paying attention
BoroBrony: :O add meh!

TESMMO*
TES Should stick to single player
who is it we are watching on the stream
;D
Phase4, no, they completely took out what made TES in this MMO.
BoroBrony, Yo
No reason to call it TES though. :/
yes phase4
TES sounds like a soccer game I've seen.
AdamTheDuck, it could work but they probably screwed it up
Hence more, when has Beth EVERY been good at ANY multiplayer game?
EVER*
imagine two dovahkiin running around shouting at stuff :)
brony2447 yeah atleast couch co-op
oh mah god daggerfall was the best multiplayer game Ninjazz

<3
And also think, when has Bethesda ever made a stable game? :$
o u.
+phase4: yo
AdamTheDuck: what do you mean?
rate this map 10/10 just for Pikmin implement.
AdamTheDuck, in their defence, their games are too masive to keep track of EVERYTHING.
brony2447, Fallout 3 and New Vegas were buggy as hell
brony2447 all of bethesda's games have been all glitchy and messed up
yes very buggy but good
Haven't too much of Oblivion to come across any major bugs
HOHOHO
BUGS AND GLITCHES
So fun.
To the moooooooooooooooon.
beth is the king of glitches
yeah i guess so...like earlier i was playing skyrim and the beggining dragon died in the air i was like DAFUQ?
Rofl
brony2447, you should have seen New Vegas at launch. Jesus it was horrible.
Except when the games actually worked they where supa dupa fun!
lots of lag
HEHE who remembers the launch of Magicka.
08,01baby got baaaaaaaack

How do I enable it?
Gold_Demona, go to the server browser
and add it as a favorite server
Or do it that way.
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
Go to the options, go to advanced multerplayer options and enough dev concole. Or that way, yeah.
Thats what I just said >:3
ow jaymoo.
I feel like such an idiot. I have no idea what I'm looking for...
You typed what I just deleted.
yu tak me words
Don't worry, Gold, we've all been there at least once.
Ninjazz is still there for example.
:>
Ninjazz, hehe ikr
:<
Gold_Demona: eyup youll pick it up pretty quick.
Which server is it?
I can't fave it if I can't find it
208.167.245.210:27015
Gold_Demona: Scroll up and copy the IP
So many files, gfdi.
Gold_Demona, ponyville friendship is alltalk
208.167.245.210:27015, oh Phase4 already beat me to it :$
Aaaand of course it's not on the list. T^T
Gold_Demona, keep refreshing in your favourited servers tab :P
AdamTheDuck: What good would it do to refresh my favorites tab when I have no favorites. :P
Didn't you add in the server in your favorites Gold_Demona? :$
Phase4: Haha! You shalll never beat celestia >:3
AdamTheDuck: I have to FIND it first
Mega_Milk, ikr
You add the server via ip o.o
hmm
AdamTheDuck: This is my first time trying to find a server.
almost hale
Ok ok, which method are you going through Gold_Demona, add server method or console method?
AdamTheDuck: Add server
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
AdamTheDuck: I don't know how to enable my console so I'm trying to just find the server
AdamTheDuck: With which I'm having no luck so far.
am joining it now :) :)
Again :<
You want it again?
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
:<<
You said again.
i didn't mean again "again".
Suure.
:c
:> <3
haha i love vinyl :3
^
She is awesome :>
Ohai Ponies47
/me licks Ponies47
/me Licks AdamTheDuck
:3
:D
I found it! Finally! =D
/me licks Gold_Demona :3
Gold_Demona, you joined!
Gold_Demona: Told ya youd pick it up quick ^-^
AdamTheDuck gave me a video that helped. XD
Now I just have to download the maps and I'll be in
Gold_Demona, oh God they take ages to download :<
What class should I be? I'm not good at any of them. XD
Gold_Demona: It randomly gives you one
Oh cool
Gold_Demona: You dont get to pick in arena -lol
I suck at all of them, so it makes no difference to me. lol XD
Gold_Demona, theres a lot of download
Mega_Milk, you do :P
Gold_Demona, be demoman
Gold_Demona: You may even be saxton hale aka celestia luna etc...
derp
i meen heavy
Well, if it takes too long this time, then I'll have them for next time. :P
Gold_Demona, be heavy, point gun and shoot
Phase4: Really? Then why have I never seen you pick a class like scout or medic >:3
Mega_Milk, i tend not to
no clue how to medic in vsh
Phase4: You guys could REALLY use a medic -lol
and lag prevents scout
He doesn't wanna be helpfull
Heavy sounds fun. I like point and shoot tactic. :D
Gold_Demona: Keep in mind
Gold_Demona: You will take incredibly heavy damage from the boss
Gold_Demona: So you will probably be one of the first to die
being slow and all
Mega_Milk, oh you :$
I'm expecting to be the firs tto die regardless, Mega_Milk. lol XD
That's always lovely to mention.
Gold_Demona, i think the next map is prophunt
nvm, its vsh_farm_field
AdamTheDuck: Dems da fax
I'm just happy I found the server. :>
Gold_Demona: My point being though you ay want to go demo or soldier
am gunna try join it now :)
Gold_Demona: Good range and you can set traps
Mega_Milk: I'll have to feel my way through all the classes really. Like I said, I'm not very good at any of them.
Gold_Demona: Then go soldier
Gold_Demona: Really easy to use
Gold_Demona: OR do what most do when they start and go medic
Phase is playing medic! :<
Gold_Demona: You dont have to learn much and you can be very productive to the team
AdamTheDuck, and i did bugger all
lol dem derpy scouts
Phase4: Dont let them discourage you! You were mlg as medic >:3
i am waiting on the map to load lol
Phase4: Firin dem darts! >:3
Mega_Milk, i did bugger all though
dat wrench
Phase4: True. Im not sure what bugger means. But true.
Is that anything like a booger. P:
?
dat punctuation fail
To say "Bugger off" means to "go away", so "bugger all" I assume means "eh screw it"
I'll get in someday, lol XD
Gold_Demona: Is your PC any good?
Mega_Milk: It's good enough
Gold_Demona: And do you have a nice steady internet connection?
Mega_Milk: Runs other Valve games with no problems
Bugger all means nothing.
it means he cant do anything so if you say i can do bugger all to that tank because all i have is a pistol
You aren't Australian AdamTheDuck.
Mega_Milk: Usually. Depends on the internet's mood at the time. Seems to be going good right now
Shame on you
Gold_Demona: Then you should be fine ^-^
Jmo, yeah I'm not really thaaat Australian :P
on an unrelated not, i fixed my planetside runtime error. turned out it simply didnt like my program-folder. expected as much
*note
I don't even follow football Jmo :S
:)
Gold_Demona: Just watch your ass on the field :3
srs bsns
Neither do I.
Mega_Milk: Yeah, just waiting on the maps to download is all. XD
BOOM
owned
You aren't special.

Phase ees ded
not big suprise
gold is lagging.....
:D Gold_Demona is playing too
Lolwut
Phase4: Shotgun sniping? -lol
SPLAT
WTF?
fuck this
.-.
Phase4: HAHAHAHA! ya gotta snipe back mate! >:3
Mega_Milk, i CANT
That doesn't look like fun at all :<
Gold_Demona: Wow you got an ass wuppen! bahahahaha
250ms ping plus laptop mouse
NO ONE can snipe through that on that course
Phase4: Your a lousy shot?
Phase4: I couldve done that now phase :3 -lol
Mega_Milk, come over here to australia and you tell me how easy it is
Phase4: You kept looking at the floor >:3
remember that the boat movment is bugs
Well I should head off to bed. Goodnight everyone :P
Mega_Milk, LAPTOP MOUSE
/me noms Phase4
night Adam
Phase4: :D
sensetivitys all screwed
Thanks for streaming Phase4 :P
Phase4: Fair enough fair enough.
Mega_Milk, you come to my house and show me, then i'll belive that i just suck
Phase4: Hahahaha! :D no i mean like you kept taking wild goose shots
i was moving the mouse as fast as i can while zoomed
my right mouse button is broken
Phase4: Oh no
and due to server lag the transition betwene zoom and non zoom is huge
Phase4: You need a working mouse to snipe sir :3
you saw it, the retical bugged
Phase4: Yeah it was looking kinda silly. Even for you phase -lol
what i'm actually angry at is the idiot who made the map
all the physics is server side
which is fine if the server and client are on the same machine
Phase4: Hahaha XD it looked fun but only if you have a nice balance.
if not, the server yells at the clients untill they update
Phase4: -lol regardless
so my ship was always 250ms behind where it actually was
Phase4: You guys got an ass wupping!
Phase4: -lol yeah I saw. Plus the flying sentry -lol
:<
Phase4: I know I know :3
How'd I do? 8D
its litterally i'm 8 feet away and dead before my client knows i've teleported to the ship
Phase4: -lol in a fair match I know you would have have pwned -lol
Gold_Demona: TERRIBLE! :D
Yay!~
Mega_Milk, well thats not true, i would have held my own though
Gold_Demona: Did you even kill anyone?
I don't think so. lol XD
Phase4: Yeah on the boat you couldnt even get on deck without getting a helmet full of phase brain soup -lol XD
Gold_Demona: I was jk with ya
Gold_Demona: Ya did pretty good
Gold_Demona: Saw you fire off a few shots artleast
For newbie XD
Gold_Demona: Some didnt even get to do that -lol
Gold_Demona: Whats your name on steam? Ill add you and give you a few weps to get you moving
gold_demona I do believe
that was Fun-AY!
You guys got bent over the sink in that match -lol :D
Gold_Demona: There i added you -lol
Gold_Demona: was it you talking on the stream?
Nope
I don't have my headset plugged in
Gold_Demona: awww, I bet your voice is awesome too :D
I'm really shy. =(
I wouldn't really have much to say anyway
Gold_Demona: You know how to use in game chat right?
Nope
Gold_Demona: I'd talk only if people answered back and yell "THERE'S A GUY THERE" :D
Gold_Demona: Press "Y" to speak to type to everyone
Gold_Demona: Press "U" To talk specifically to your team.
Ooooh. And here I've been banging the enter key trying to get the thing to pop up. XD
Yeah I figured you didnt know how to talk
Cuz that's how it works in all the MMOs I play
Hit enter, then type.
Yeah. But TF2 is in a different world of its own -lol
Here's it's y or u. okie dokie
but hey atleast you got a taste of the action before phase raged :3
lol yeah
I could barely see what Phase was doing. :P
Yeah, I only have the basic weapons and the hats you get from doing the tutorial. XD.
:)
yeah your gonna get new weapons just by playing
but to get anything good you either have to have a premium account aka buy something
or trade
well, I got the day off today - and 2 hours sleep
I see
Trade, I can do that
Buy, no
Hey, I actually had some kills! =D
My stats says I got two kills
Woo!
I only buy games :D not virtual objects
Gold_Demona: woo indeed :$
I sometimes am amazed myself when I get kills
So how does trading work exactly?
http://themittani.com/news/planetside-2-beta-patch-notes --- I know some of you play PS2 :)
Especially since I have pretty much nothing. :P
I usually have more luck at playing medic/airblasting people to blow flames away or separate ubers :D
5 gig update... not too bad
How large is TF2 now?
In gigabytes I mean
/me shrugs
DED
And 'allow!

Gold_Demona: Ya know go to your steam account
Gold_Demona: There should be an icon on your desktop
I already accepted your friend request.

Yeah
I loved Fable 1 & TLC - 2 was great - 3 had an awesome spooky villain, could have ended better, but that thing taking over Walter wasnt bad - mainly want to see where the series goes
Gold_Demona: Are you offline?
Nope
I'm in the game in fact.
Gold_Demona: If so thats why I cant req you.
I'm spactatorin' :]
I hope Trolls come back in F:Journey - major improvement on their look in 2 - shame there were only 2 swamp troll fights - Witchwood & The Arena
Gold_Demona: -lol well it says your offline for me.
Gold_Demona: So some other time I suppose.
It shouldn't... I thought I fixed that. O_o
There. Online.
Why does it automatically make me offline? I don't get that.
o.o
Gold_Demona: You there?
Yup
Can you see the items
etc...
I was about to say, Holy cow all that for me?

The smartgrid told the power company that there might be a problem in the future and it needs maintenance. So a guy from them came over to do that maintenance. He had to shut off the power for 20 minutes, but he was done in 10.
twilight_sprinkle: Because i enjoy them Sooooo much >:3

hi
Sylandest yeah, music like this have really crushing Timeframes to complete for the amount of work you have to do, William Anderson (if I get his Name right, the BGM Guy for MLP) said it's quite hard
Iron_Edge: Most people do. /hairflip
FillyFlam: Haha http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx60Pf7A1xo
Iron_Edge: dont make me get a restraining order
Lil_B: aye, it can be. But if you have the passion for it, you can make it work, hehe
twilight_sprinkle: there is no order that can restrain me >_>
Iron_Edge: like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP5uzlzt6ls ?
Sylandest passion... I don't know >.> , but I defenitly don't really have the Time xD
Lil_B: then perhaps you need a more time friendly music profession? :D

I'm surprised that they didn't ban the IP address that shows up when I'm using 3G.
Well, at least it's quiet right now.
the Guy who made this now now arranges for orchestras http://youtu.be/mWjzBlwI1C8 :D
Would you like the beard on or off?
I like that Europeans were the best music wise in terms of Gameboy and NES music xD
Off, please
Fear me, you lords and lady preachers! I descend upon your Earth from the skies!
Too bad.
On
Beards are manly
Being a mass of pure Viking (I couldn't type that without laughing), I must agree.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM50TY9xl2g
But it depends if you want to show yourself as high testosterone or not
Well
/me starts throwing tetris blocks into the chat
Having enough testosterone to grow facial hair
8 bit music.
Yeaaaah!
LINE PIECE
God, I love beards.
Anyone here ever play Doctor Mario?
Kammerjunk, you've been here a while, right?
I suppose.
yeah i have it on wii
its basically tetris
Also it is chilly in my house right now....
I'm hardly a veteran, though. Joined a while before S2 aired as an anon.
I wish our furnace didnt break....
For those who used to have a beard - http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=xI1rKORTVDs

/me sets the chat on fire
Not on BronyState.
What about on this IRC in general
:D The Beards have another song called "If Your Dad Doesn't Have a Beard, You've Got Two Mums"
Possibly. I don't know, honestly. Wasn't a regular, at any rate.

You know, my dad never taught me how to shave. I debearded thanks to my high school.
My dad doesn't really give a damn.
At first I tried to punch it off.
..What
What?
hi
Punch your beard off..
How does that even work
My dad died before he could teach me
But it's not like you need to be taught
Pretty straight forward
That's a Chuck Norris stunt right there Barbetos|AtWork :D
Jmo Lets just say the beard survived but my consciousness did not.
You don't say.
Oh but I do!
What if punched harder, though?

Well I will let you know in about an hour.

Maid_RainBow1: :(.

Hey everypony
NENUDJUS: X is a variable
I hate algebra
There's your answer
solve it! now
X is <5
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Il4VAYYTk0 this is glorius
If they mark it wrong, tell them it's right
Dumorimasoddaa: if you round it up
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa algebra it hurts my brain
:P
Algebra is the most pointless bullcrap evuh
I can andle algebra. It's geometry that gets me.
Round it up or not still between 4and 5
Andle dat algrebra.
but it is 4.56155
lol yup
I andle it leik a baws
yes i mean who is going to use it really :P
awyea
BoroBrony. I use it sometimes.
Math is boring
SpadeMagnes[School]: ... so is your life
Can I ask a question: Why do 'muricans say Math
ok i dont because i am really bad at it
Gold_Demona: I hear ya, on geometry.
Bye everypony
Serenity: hell if I know
Serenity: It's shorter of course.
Yeah I couldn't be aresed to do it properly I lack paper
One letter shorter, heh
Usually proportions
Hence going by rangers
bye Maid_RainBow
I had it at 4.5-4.6
/me paints the chat
Then I gave up cos I couldn't be arsed
/me was painted!
/me quickly jumps in water and washes off the paint
Serenity: because "maths" sounds retarded?
SpadeMagnes[School]: What colors did you use?
Gold_Demona: Maths is plural, therefore it sounds right
Green,black...
It's probably the other way around, but Math sounds stupid to me :L
I've never heard anybody say "maths" and sound smart saying it. >.>
Maths sounds stupid
I do MATHS! 8D
"Maths" is acceptable outside the US and Canada.
Btw. Kammerjunk, still play APB?
Well it certainly cant sound right in a sentence
I'm going to do Maths... wut
Serenity: From time to other.
Cool. Since I now own a computer capable of maxing anything, I'm gonna download it :]
any one wanna do some Calculus ?
I'm used to British English
Understandable.
Maths is weird
Although I am used to Danish accents, and they're just horrendous.
yeah british ftw
Cos it's mathatics
Thus a plural
I'm going to have to drop off, but it was nice talking with y'all again!
Yeah, I get the grammatical logic behind it, but it still sounds incredibly weird
Gold_Demona: you missed the chat being terrible :D
Have fun, Everlasting_Joy.
I should be back a little later.
bored bored...
eeyup
Nothing is happening :L
Who's up for L4D2?

I haven't even seen the first one,

I'll go watch Expendables 2 right after I stick my head into a bucket of boiling water.
Chuck Norris, Arnold Swartzinegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone in 1 shot shooting guns and stuff is just priceless
cachi01|phone: also, House of the Dead zombie and Q-bert :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIejbnrHOc - and still have an original working game ^_^
MadSurge didnt see qbert or the house of the dead zombie :o
Madsurge, I have a question, forgive me if I ask this: Do you have a Friend code for 3DS if you own one at all?
all the ponys are my fav>_>
cachi01|phone: poor Q-bert is homeless :'( thanks a lot COD
I miss the Ultima series
:O
Alister: That was an excellent choice of game.
Cypresswolf: another series EA successfully ruined
Kammerjunk: Thank you
Serenity: why yes I do!
I only have the game boy versions 1 & 2 left
Have you added me, because I added someone here, and I keep forgetting who it is

Bored....

SpadeMagnes[School]: why you bored?
I do say, Polydunami looks stylin'.
Seductive derpy you say?? *click*
Kammerjunk, do you have pitctures of /everyone/?
Now that I remember back playing Runes of Virtue 2, The Chalice in the cavern of Selfishness - I only successfully retreived that twice
i like seductive luna better
ASoftFluffyThing: Well, not /everyone/.
ASoftFluffyThing: I don't think I have a picture of you around.
...For example.
do you have pictures of me?
Eenope.
/Everyone/?
Kammerjunk, no you don't.
Really, it's mostly the mods.
Ironically, though, I don't have a picture of myself anywhere.
This chat is about as active as a morgue
You have thsee skeletal knights walking back & forth pushing vases - you're supposed to get through several rows without blocking the doors to the room with floor switches that unlock a series of gates
SpadeMagnes[School]: you could always go onto /r/clopclop if you are bored
oh my
ROfl
Well..... More than 100,000 people die a day soooo we can say we are pretty active
im just sitting here
watching End of Evangelion
prepared to tear my face off
the gates at the bottom contain several items, last of which is the Chalice
The ultimate mindfuck Bronysith ?
I should be doing Java, but instead I'm here, listening to Beethoven and watching chat.
pft beethoven....
Kammerjunk, http://imgur.com/TF9Uu

Beethoven is best metalhead
ASoftFluffyThing: This is now in my collection.

No, that's just daribot.
Kammerjunk: Wait wait you have actualy pictures of the mods???
Iron_Edge: Sure, who'd you like to see?

Kammerjunk: Me sir >:3

cachi01|phone: ...Consarnit. I do have SB - http://derpy.me/fMMGL - but I don't have Shizu.
AAARGH
cachi01|phone: that's not even the worst dungeon :)
haha! SB looks so mlg in a suit :3
Kammerjunk so thats how he looks like
Shizu is mysterious
SB does look pretty boss.
Kammerjunk: What about mica?
Cypresswolf i must get that game O_O
I've seeb Sumi a few times
Stygian Abyss lvls 1-10 http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50691
Hm. I don't reckon I have Sumi 'round here.
i havent seen sumica
That's a shame.
Kammerjunk: What about......vivi?
Kammerjunk: Or kirz?
Kammerjunk: Or slurry?
Stygian Abyss lvls 11-26 http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50692
Kirz isn't a mod anymore :P
He was
Serenity: Shad up! Hes still a mod to me ;^;
^
Why you gotta ask all these hard questions, man. Finding people is hard!
Kammerjunk: You scare me, matey.
AND THEN - there's a dungeon where you need to play with a friend to make it to the end - never had a friend who could find the game :(
Anyway
Back to the Oreos!
Iron_Edge: just like Silverscreen :(
MadSurge: Exactly ;^;
Silverscreen still lurks around on Film Nights
/me steals one of Serenity's oreos
To give us all of the facts
With his intriguing trivia.
I kinda miss Shy being around here
Yum, oreos
^_^ Best Part of the game - well, My Personal Favorite - The Texas Cave http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/585980-ultima-runes-of-virtue-ii/faqs/50792
Oh yeah, Shy hasn't been around.
Kammerjunk: what about fluttercry?
Kammerjunk: Or TOM 0.0
Tom. The ultimate prize.
Kammerjunk: Or ghosties
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P1gESvjY6Y&
The Bat Cave is just that - A Bat Cave :D
^^
Kammerjunk: Or bacon mane aka lord celestia
Iron_Edge: fluttercry is still around sometimes
The chat has come down with dysentery
Oh hell naw. His Baconness scares me.
MadSurge: Yeah Im asking for pictures of them
MadSurge: Im intrested to see what our moderators look like -lol
Bats respawn Eternally
Goddamned bats
Kammerjunk: And what about phase and scoots?
http://i.imgur.com/ywPRE.jpg - Scoots is on the right.
Kammerjunk: You shall show me saxy then! >:3
Saxy's in the middle.
I wanna see newdcd again :(

The NE cave on that link is the one where you need a 2nd player to get through - never made it past level 2 on my own
NOOOO!

Vordox: Pardon?
hahaha
nice
Rustymeat yea, I miss him and that dog of his
TheMovieBrony is taking a hiatus. :(
I don't even know.
Cypresswolf so its impossible to complete the game in a ROM
I know you can send a rescued mayor through, but if they die, you're screwed - they dont respawn and the game is over
Wow...tough game is tough
you need all 8 runes to open Stygian Abyss
Iron_Edge: Oh, but have you seen http://test.du.cx/pics/IPw9RR.png
Really, though, I'm jelly of those books.
Kammerjunk: Ohhhh mai~
I want those books, man.
Kammerjunk: Hahahahahaha XD nice shot -lol

Very smexeh
you sure like to archive things Kammerjunk
Kammerjunk is twilight?
Kammerjunk, uh..........
I spend hours on end organising and archiving stuff.
ASoftFluffyThing: Nice shot right? :D
Iron_Edge, YES.
Kammerjunk: who is that again?
I forgot about the ships in the game :) There are a limited supply, so if you go around and destroy them all - Game Over
Kammerjunk: oh my~

I've been looking for Earthbound Mother, but cant find a copy that doesnt involve buying it online *shrugs*
Dken2021: Hahah XD
Iron_Edge, are you Liokin?
The only Harvest Moon game I ever had is A Wonderful Life and the other one with a more chibi-like style.
ASoftFluffyThing: Eeyup :3
You were Mega_Milk yesterdaaaay~
That one with the whole goddess crap going on...
ASoftFluffyThing: Aka mega milk :3
Cypresswolf i have to play it on an emulator

Bye MadSurge...

VenHur: Ever play the RPG version ...what was it? Rune Factory
/me gets 50 rings and jumps into a special stage
Cypresswolf: Um...no?
MadSurge: Have fun! Hope a malevolent entity doesn't remove the ladders!
I've been playing too much MurderSim lately.
Sims*
08,01oh oh! one of my favourite grimdark stories has just been updated!
08,01wheeee!
/me got a Chaos Emerald
08,01reading time...
/me murders SpadeMagnes[School]
Oh! I didn't know you were there.
Awkward.
I still had rings
VenHur: the 1st one I highly recommend - you're still doing the farm thing, but you also get to fight monsters in dungeon - there are fields you can grow food in the dungeons where its 1 season all the time. the weather wont effect them and not watering for awhile doesnt kill them
/me runs
/me can never figure out what pings him in this channel
Razyn
So why was I "murdered"
heh
/me touches SpadeMagnes[School]
The 2nd game however - too much going on - if there are 6 or more town folk in one area, youre game lags, also the raining confetti or flowers makes the game lag worse when there are too many people >_<
There now u have 0 rings
You know you have a console named after you, right?
/me grabs a ring
/me holds up a Sega Genesis
You know you have a plenet named after you, right?
You should feel proud of yourself...
planet*
Ur anus?
Oh.
You know you have a car brand named after you, right?
/me gets another Chaos Emerald
This grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says: "Hey, we have a drink named after you."
And a Sailor Scout
A man walks into a bar
Ouch
And damnit, I wants to play Sonic Xtreme...IF IT WAS RELEASED!
Sonic Riders..woo
Soup cabbage
sonic riders....yeah...woohoo.........
there's always sonic robo 2
2.5gb/4.6 gb downloaded
Sonic Genesis, best GAME EVER
:P
VenHur dont mention sonic R
Taken around 1.2 hours, wish it would hurry up
And then theres...Sonic 06
What? Because of...oh dear god, HE'S behind me isn't he?
VenHur RUN
/me runs for mercy
From what?
SpadeMagnes from It...
/me smacks It with a steel pipe
SpadeMagnes He is invincible
He will eat ur soul
Sonic Adventure 2 is best sonic game
I doubt he can eat a cyber program
Not the best. But its fun
I thought Sonic 3 and Knuckles was THE best...well...of the Genesis games actually.
The lip syncing could use work
SpadeMagnes dont question the doll
I hates the 4Kids Tails voice...sounds more girly and all that crap....
VenHur: I agree, except I'd call it the best in the whole franchise
^
VenHur: S3&K that is
You know what was stupid about Sonic's Sega genesis collection for the 360?
So, let's take a little retrospective in my personal views.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
They didnt put Sonic 3 and K together because of apperent "space limitations"
Morning Bstate!!!
sonic is a terrible series anyways
I call bullshit
Sonic 1, what can I say? It's freaking Sonic The Hedgehog, go figures.
Morning Panda :)
But yeah...it's a classic.
Bronysith: That's just cuz you're Mister Judgey McJudgementalpants
:) cachi01|phone, why you always on the phone?
soace limitations? on a 360?
well hang on
Sonic Adventure 2 battle was awewomes
What fucking space limitations could there be on a 360 disc by putting the two games together\
Panda right now. My mom is using el shitbox soooo lol
cachi01|phone XD
especially when they only take up to about 4-8 mb
hello Gold_Demona
SpadesMagnes[School] It's not so much putting the two games together as it is putting a whole other game on there.
And then they rereleased the game with it on there!
SpadesMagnes[School] That's twice as long as the other two.
Except it was limited if I recall
Sonic 2, what's probally everyone's favorite Sonic game, for me, I seen better.
But whats the point of putting all the games and not the whole thing
it was my favorite for sure
I love Sonic 2.
It's my second favorite
Sonic Jam's easy mode is pathetic
It's WOULD of been my favorite...it is haven't been for that Mystic Cave Zone Super Sonic glitch...
Sonic 3 & Knuckles is my top favorite
How many hits does the Death Egg Robo take?
Sonic.CD has best hidden messages
8 if I remember
I've never had any glitchy problems with Super Sonic. O_o
I loved Sonic 3 too
Sonic 3 alone, It's better, more faster, and it's the first to feature good ol' Knucklehead.
Sonic jam's easy mode kills it in 3 Dken2021
God, I love Italian food.
sonic 3 was pretty much win
