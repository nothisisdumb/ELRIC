It was out before the episode ended.
damn
now for real back to programming
Si.
Da.
Ja.
Ita.
Fu.
When and how do you tell when it's "out of hand"? I mean, jeesus. The artists get content out faster than any other group I've ever seen. But it's still apparently not at /that/ point yet.
Oui.
...I'm all out.
Hai.
Ninjazz|Busy: Hai.
RoboGerbil: God dammit, man. Why did you have to link that.
It's so darned CATCHY.
its addicting like i said...
Ninjazz|Busy Honestly it probably already is at /that/ point
This is better. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c98gIxCe1zo
Eh. I really hope I am wrong though.
Barbetos, but does it change anything?
"This video contains content from EMI, who has blah blah blah."
goddammit
Ninjazz|Busy Yes. It does, and if you don't think so just look what has happened to other fandoms that got the same treatment
why is it that movies display runtime in minutes
CTHULHU: To be honest, I prefer Raubtier.
bia everyone
Barbetos, the keyword is fandom. You get any bad apple in the bunch all the whole group gets spoiled. Granted anyone is free to do whatever they want to in their bedrooms as long as they don't freaking talk about it like it's casual conversation.
hello everypony!
Kammerjunk: I can respect that.
CTHULHU: That's not to say they aren't good, of course. Always a fan of metal.
right on.
Ninjazz|Busy It wish what you said was possible with the bad apple as you put it, but this is the day and age of the internet where everything is put there, for everyone to find.
anypony here that's been in Shizuka's stream last night?.........i'm back
Now if you had NEVER ever seen this fandom before, and you decide you want to check it out, the first thing you do is google My Little Pony Friendshi is Magic and you see r34, do you THINK you would stick around?
And the same thing goes for people already in the fandom.
Those same people who did the google search are going to ask
One bad apple spoils the bunch for everyone else, though. The image the rest of the world has of bronies is because of the select few people who act like downright jerks. The worst part of any group is always the loudest.
Barbetos, then it's just something we deal with, man. Can't change it. Can't make people shut up about it. Especially when complaining about anything apparently just makes it more controversial. I mean, I'd like to limit the porn to a limit where it's only in places where people HAVE to look for them. Not the case where people can stumble on them. But we just have to deal with it. :/
And with jerks, I mean the people who insist on shoving it down the throats of everyone around them.
Hello Wrek!
best song youve prolly never heard of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj3mKYASycg
Hello everypony, i'm back!
i would and am still with it also with the kim possible fandom
wrek2, we only see your splash image.
There's a kim possible fandom?
I felt the same way as you Ninjazz|Busy I did not think it mattered. And then when I tried to argue that it was okay with some one who was against r34 for mlp I found I had no legit arguement as to how it could be good for anything.
Ninjazz|Busy: If you play with Google Images, you're bound to get burned.
FINNTROLL!!!
Barbetos, in that case, it didn't matter if it was good or not. If someone wanted to make porn, they're going to make porn. Unless you can convince hundreds of like minded artists.
i was searching for kp wallpapers and i came acrossed the r34 imigase at age 15 i had a psp
Kammerjunk, boy did I learn that the hard way.
Barbetos, not to make porn and make something else.*
Barbetos: Well, that's the thing. It's good to -them- because -they- like it.
i was using google images with no filters
Ninjazz|Busy your missing the point. I realize it is going to happen and I have no control. I am not complaining, some of those artist are pretty good. I am saying it WILL ruin everything good that bronies have worked for. No one would continue with that name if it meant to be tagged with the ideal that you like to look at that sort of thing.
use bing then.
R34 ruins the fandom? You've never been on /mlp/, I take it.
People there don't need R34 to destroy the image of the fandom.
Not saying I don't see it.
Kammerjunk R34 is probably the worst aspect though, and the most likely to do so.
nice spitfire @wreck
I have no controll over it I realize, agian I am not trying to make it stop.
Its fine, its just bad.
Get it?
And that's assuming I believe there is a such thing as a collective fandom. To me, the whole brony thing is just a bunch of people who watch the show. I don't like to imagine I have an image to set to the outside world because of my preferences.
Oh no no. Barbetos, I don't think r34 ruins the fandom at all. It's just part of it. It's there but it's like all regular porn. It's always the extremists that ruin any group. You /can/ like the porn and still be a chill person in most respects. Also, I have to disagree on the point that bronies are working towards anything in general. I mean...what are we trying to accomplish? I thought
being a brony was about being a fan.
i agree. ^
To summarise my beliefs about most everything, if you don't stick it down the throats of others, I really couldn't care less.
Tolerance of everything but intolerance.
O_o
alright animations are done
now to write the code
what band is this?
"Just don't hurt anyone" is mine. Rather broad statement.
miku pony
CTHULHU: This is Alestorm with Keelhauled.
oh, thanks
Ninjazz|Busy And for a lot of people that is where it stops. But what about... Bronystate? Do you think you would of ever found this place if it weren't for MLP? Furthermore do you think it would be as well run? Now imagine if this site starts to lose viwership becuase of a stigma like I am speaking of? I like this place, and I like the charities, and the conventions. All that could go away
with a simple misconception made by a few "bad" apples.
05heh
05bad apples
His words.
I mean why do you think there is a rule here against that sort of thing?
wow that was easy
Its not becuase it is just unwanted, but it would chase people off.
Its offensive, and it matters.
What would chase people off?
*butting into the conversation*
Smut
r34.
o_e
The reason I came here and stayed was becuz of that rule, haha
new stream chased some people off?
Barbetos, well, let me put it this way. I found MLP, the fandom because of the very thing we're discussing. First thing I saw was a porn spray of Pinkie Pie in TF2. I hated it and everyone associated with the fandom for a while but got over than realized that none is anyof my business to judge. Look where I am now. I mean, all this stuff is hard to calculate and just... happens, man.
Good lord look at my grammar.
I'd like to see an actual habour café some day.
harbour*
Ninjazz|Busy: good thing we dislike pony r34 eh? :)
05so far so good on this image :3
MadSurge, I have no problems with it. But I'd like it to stay where it belongs. ^_^
i was the same way after seeing starscream getting his ass whooped by rd but after hering this day aria i got attached especially when i saw the first 2 eps of season 1
Wrek: you just need to put something on those bare walls :D
Ninjazz|Busy Still, not agrueing that it should or should not happen. It does. I am stating that it can be bad for bronies in general, in all facets of the aspect of calling yourself a brony. Worst case it stops the show from ever being made again by a decent studio. Its great that YOU see past it, and see it for what it is, but people generally have a closed mind to that thing.
djblazekin: to be honest G1 Starscream was always a complete joke
Man, Alestorm always makes me want to play Sid Meier's Pirates.
While you may have been made a fan, I bet there where 10 people on that server who would never look at bronies, or mlp in a good light becuase of ONE little pic.
Or so I'm told
I know if I saw 'that' spray first, i wouldve hated bronies.
I guess I was just lucky I was on 4chan when I learned of the fandom anyway.
Kind of makes it hard to take the content serious.
Barbetos, and I agree with that but you can't control people. All anyone really can do is just be a good example. Hell, if I met the guys that made me rethink my opinion on the fandom first before I saw the porn, I would have joined sooner probably.
seriously*
I learned of the fandom After watching the full first season :D
And worried i was the only one that liked mlp
I have a great resistance to those kind of things, so I would have tried to see ponies anyway
Ninjazz|Busy: who were these people thou speakest of?
I learned of the fandom, then decided to watch the first few episodes. To do so, I went ahead and downloaded all released episodes of S1 in the highest resolution I could find.
MadSurge, funnily enough, all I can remember is one person named "Pinkie Pie".
00,10twas a nice PS2 run
Well time to get nakid and wash myself.
=D
00,10love me some lib gunning
i mean.. shower.
<< >>
Uh, beg'yr pard'n, but we don't normally wear clothes.
Ninjazz|Busy: well, power to them! Spreading the good fandom word and all
In the beginning, there was the Word. And the Word was Faust.
MadSurge, haven't seen them since though... Don't even know if they're even still active.
You know what? I'm no stranger to the idea of the worst aspects of one's community supposedly representing the entire group. I'm a big supporter of the Tea Party, and I don't appreciate the small handful of actual racists being made out to represent the vast majority of decent people who just want the government to get out of everyone's face.
That's usually the case in any situation really. :/
my ex will not even give the show a chance and yet gave the worst game in history a shot and she says mlp fim sucks
Kandarihu: The worst part of anything is always the loudest, and thus the most known.
Kammerjunk: I would really say the Word was Bonnie Zacherle :D
MadSurge: Heretic!
Zacherle was but the a tool for the will of Faust.
Nay, creationist :D
On a side note, I have no idea what I'm talking about.
Kammerjunk: she was the woman who came up with the original My Little Pony concept :)
Oh right, the whole My Pretty Pony thing.
Oh! I -do- know of her!
http://i.imgur.com/mjiBa.jpg
And that's why.
Kammerjunk: Funny thing is that she was sad that they ended up being only for girls :D bet she's very happy of the new generation :3
...I really like her mane.
Kammerjunk, as long as that is universal, I think the only good that these stereotypes can do is to play off of each other hypothetically and cancel each other out. However, there are cases where the worst of society really is in charge, and the nicest parts are the exception instead of the rule.
Kammerjunk: and yeah, that's an ace picture
David Tennant is my idol for being so damn sexy.
Kandarihu: 'Tis a sad state of affairs.
Rum! Rum! Rum! Rum!
Man, I love me some Alestorm.
who is the current incarnation is it david tenent or someone else
djblazekin: It's currently Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor.
Matt Smith I think?
But don't tell dari that.
^
hi
Oh hi, artist
metal+
?
Yup. Alestorm.
oh wrek, you and your music taste
Metal will overthrow all other genres and gain world domination.
drum roll please
yupp
surprise i also got knee deep in the fandom after hearing the doctor whooves and the assistant show and reading the first book of shards of equestria then cried my little brony heart after listening to micthemicrophone read my little dashy
ummmm, what?
Maaaan, MLD was such a thing back then.
i've heard that reading too
cause of my little dashy i love fanfic now.
i ment fallout not shards i'm confusing mtg with fallout derp
i havent read to many good ones
I didn't read FO:E. I'm just too damn lazy.
fallout equestria is realy good
you dont have a face!
I'll just be waiting for the FO:E mod for FO3.
djblazekin: i might read it
And hope they don't cancel it before it's out.
i've heard silent ponyville is good
The fallout over the Ct school shooting has brought out a lot of sterotypes on both sides of the aisle. Progressives are using this to try to ban firearms. Conservatives are blaming it on digital culture. Others are blaming it on any advocacy for the mentally ill. But what I understand about why it happened indicates that the whole motive is much more nuanced.
k
but fare warning my gf loves the grimdark fanfics like cupcakes and sweet apple masecre
sweet apple massecre was ridicoules
00,10http://tinyurl.com/d6ab4sr
Sumica: ohgodwhy
Sumica, HA... HA... HA... HA... HAHAHAHAHA
i showed her the gary's mod animated version of the cupcakes movie and she laughed as poor dashy was being killed
what's the movie from movie night?
djblazekin: yay~ sadistic people! like me!
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ef895664de408c4acb878877d24ef1d7.gif She's a professional :D

?
Hmm, if the clones can do it, why not the clones?
artist, look at the image.
i diiiiiiiiiiiiid
artist i think you and my gf would get along as friends she enjoys texas chainsaw masecre, hostile, and saw
I can recommend some good fics if anyone interested.
k, recommend away
go ahead i'm doing a reading of cupcakes 2
djblazekin: saw is boring tbh
there are 2? hahaha
ok what you want a grimdark or a shipfic?
any
i havent read any shipfics
i dont red shipfics
read
farewell mortals
I'd recommend an adventure fic... Those two usually tend to be cliche.
okaydokay do it

Get out of here, stalker.
and english also have secondary school, but I dont know where it belongs
lol

things are swell
and hope you did a great job on it
Good to hear, mate.
And thanks. It was easier than I'd expected.
I'm not sure what grade is, we have 9 years (also called something like grades) at basic school, 4 years at middle school and 3 or more years at high school / university
I'm in the 4th year of middle (in english high) school
PC > console gaming.
itbegins
so next year in October I'll be at university
Someone go call Mario and get that theme going.
What with the inevitably approaching shitstorm, I should get going.
b-but...
luckilly implementation of the school fees is delayed, so I'll have 1 year free ^^
it's to quiet for a shitstorm...
and he left already...
I noticed. :<
there needs to be more games for the vita
at least my PS1 games i downloaded off the network will carry it XD
Sony needs to get their heads out of their ass.
>what is a secure PSN
well at least ill be able to play PErsona 4 golden
"What is this security thou speakest of?" - Sony
and PSO2
all on the vita
I still need to get the earlier Persona games.
with Final fantasy 6,7,8...legend of dragoon
Persona doesn't interest me in the slightest.
Kammerjunk: persona 3 is kicking my ass
Ninjazz: die
ello everyone
hey, not everyone like jrpgs
ello soulrider95
>stop disliking what I enjoy
soulrider95: Oh hi.

What's a brony?

it's a delicious chocolate treat
Ohai soulrider95
How do you plan to pay the fees though after the first year?
I like chocolate.
What is a brony? A miserable pile of D'awww
A miserable pile of unicorn farts, Kammerjunk.

Ninjazz: Oh, I get your drift.
Isn't there a site where you can put out a call for artists to do somthing for you?
I had to take out a student loan
Kammerjunk, wink wink. Nudge nudge. Wiggle wiggle wiggle.

Controllers.
Consarnit, controllers.

And I got a PS3 for dark souls, vaquish, and little big planet
*vanquish

05multiple meaning here
05to too many pinkie pies etc
05see my point?
05 /rant
I don't think it's practical to block out the titles of upcoming episodes, though. The only thing we can do is move away from Ponychat or something.
05i got tom on mute now though
ah, basically vague titles are ok then
05casue im sick of its bullshit
Wrek: can you ban tom?
05no
05hes basically the bot keepign all our irc rooms in sync
Wrek: ok now i see why hes here than
hai
05but still
05you see my point?
05where it seems titels MUSt descripe the key feature of the episode
locky me i didn't seen it :D
lucky*
Wrek: yep now i see why
see*
ah, well got your point now
just don't read it bro :D
as spoilers
Wrek: do you think the cd command is a stupid thing form the start
05actually
05yes
well when you put it as the episodes are in a set schedule, yea, only use would be if there was a schedule shift
05since the next episode airime usualyl is set on the timer above stream
Deacon, good question :D
Wrek hes also impossible to ignore
no matter how much i tried
05try cd ing

what does afk mean
away from keyboard
so, how about this season eh?
good so far
lovin it
Im excited about the finale though
because of the foreshadowing in the premiere
and the next ep sounds interesting (by title)
well first two episodes wasn't so good to make new bronies, but for now it's good asusual c:
and i didn't even speak word gak >_>
I never understood that tbh.
and I dont want to :D
Alchemist, what? What jelly means? :3
I'd also love a special editin when the whole series will be over.
the spec ed will have the scenes that didnt make it to the final cut.
as it seems there are plenty of them
hm it will be on dvd only?
It would be something like a driector's cut.
must have it too
ouo: nono, Im just saying that I'd like if that happened. Its just an idea.
aww
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW9iJg-HElM
and have the episoes listed as date they were finished.
apparently the trixie ep was supposed to be in S2.
snowing
yay my art teacher didn't fail me for the six weeks or final
yay
still ded?
MaxTheBrony: a little
MaxTheBrony: the smell is gone, but now we have a skeleton.
:p
so no hope in reviving it ?
I wont be here much longer either. My head starts to hurt.
MaxTheBrony: a stream might revive it.
yah hope so :)
Wrek could finish the spitfire pic for example if he havent already. :)

Alchemist, yeah, tumbleweed persons :D
very creative :D
just need to catch it while they crossing chatroom c:
/me passes through
dont mind me
you missed it!
there are 241 channels on ponychat servers
and still nothing on
nope
/me catch tumbleweed!
yay
nice
but why is there a chair out there?
oh crap
too late
13texasboykc09: 241 that you know of
13it does not count +s
i love the art
Shizuka: +s?
implying most know what +s is Shizuka
no idea
I also wonder why
+s means secret, meaning you ether have to know the name of the channel exactly or be invited
for sitting.
oh, ok
on pony chat ti says that was +k
ooh, pretty
we had snow, but it all melted
"38-Year-Old Little Boy Posts Picture Of Fast Car He Likes To Facebook"
13no
13+k means the channel has a password
same here, the snow melted down
http://www.theonion.com/video/38yearold-little-boy-posts-picture-of-fast-car-he,30632/
ok now that i read it right
then what does the +tn mean
13+t topic can only be changed by operators
13+n messages can only be sent to the channel by nicks in that channel

ok thanks Shizuka
I idscovered the best drink ever. http://i.imgur.com/BoXxf.jpg
I bought it at this hippy store, and ive had 4 of them since yesterday
what does it taste like?
Kind of like malty grapes
its fizzy
its good. i dont know where else do buy them so i couldn't recommend you a place.
Ive never seen the drink before
could be a brand new drink and only sold locally
i think its some small company that makes them
they are in the usa too, I know 2 places that sell them
Shizuka: what about tns?
13?
maybe whole foods has them im not sure
but seriously you need to try it.
But just get the grape one, the other ones are not as good.
Shizuka: ah, I see in the link! Secret
Shizuka: be that link mods have +o, is it that same mode that phase4 has?
13phase as +v voice
13means he can talk during +m
speaking of dat wheres Berrypunch? :(
phase can talk?
uh oh
Is it supposed to be an energy drink?
Berrypunch is best bot, nice a quiet
Im not sure
now she's gone :'(
:(
you know who i really miss
isn't Berrypunch and Tom the same bot now?
Cause I'm pretty sure Tom kicks under the alias of Berrypunch.
/me spits on Tom
Berrypunch is a drunk and will kick you cause ya'll deserve it

Hahaha I knew someone would comment with ponies on this article. http://gizmodo.com/5969731/the-cloud-factory
I see no point in doing that.
got kicked by Wrek for that
You'd get kicked by Wrek, then dabi.
Tom/Berrypunch only kicks under special circumstances.
like what?
you missed the point I made entirely, good job
remember when it was only wrek at 6
everyone else at 8
but he kept the message at 8
You'd have to ask Phase for specifics.
If someone is found conspiring against the US government Tom kicks them
Jmo: dabi whos that
Shizuka, are you looking forward to the next Steam Sale? I hear it's going to start tomorrow.
13i'm broke

Shizuka: what mode is the people on in the side channels i see with % next to thire nick
*thier
texasboykc09 like?

killerpony7733: no
damn, internet is being wocking today
Buytoast: Lol
Buytoast, lol
Buytoast you on about the next halo?
This aint the next Halo.
texasboykc09 Well simply said this is a very good remake of the game though it's only part 1 since the team who made it has been working on it for lets just say....alot and lot of years. But the game is simple science happens they test a crystal. It does bad bad things main protagonist is a doctor who knows how to use guns and all that and fights to stop the whole thing and survive
Even I know that halo don't use no puzzles.
pop goes the weasel
Boy that guy was a dick
killerpony7733: thanks
You gotta Pop some rad-x

Boy, when I did that part i thought you had to crouch past them to be all sneaky like.
Then again i was outta grenades.
Shizuka: you did that 2 times
00,10I find it funny shzu keeps jumping the gap when there is a ledge
Sumica: ikr

CriticKitten because they HAVE everything already
hello everybody(pony) guys guys guys GUUUUYS guess what!! i have tableet !
Steam sales are like wars: eventually you get so used to them that they don't phase you, and you pretty much only invest in indie games.
most indie games are pretty crap though
most games*
far too much effort wasted into art
super meat boy is exception
no gameplay in them at all
oh yeah
don't like super meat boy
meat boy was great
is this original or remake?
and binding of isaac
also a great game
Since you guys hate meatboy
yep
I HATE IT TOO
ah see
IT BROKE MY FUCKING SPACE KEY
binding of issac ftw as well
Pft, most indie games I've played are great
i just hate it because it's a bad game
should of played witha controller
lol
thats why yoou play on xbox
so much better
But then, I have this habit of not buying crap
Seems to work out well for me
lol
that first one was almost comedy into the camera
no power? better keep those giant fans going
there are so many places to redirect power from
what part of no power for the tracks did you not quite get?
CriticKitten not quite
AJ?
loljk
Well, I tried a little experiment this morning. I put every game in my wishlist in my shopping cart in the manner which I would when I buy them. The total price came down to $583.67. So yeah, I'm looking forward to this sale.
00,10yeah not like those giant fans are the cooling fans for the genoraters or any thing
Yes, that's the joke. ;P
Kandarihu: how many games?
Sumica then why do they look to be aranged more as air conditioning
wrek pinged out :O
wait
quick everyone, post gák
Aj
chrysalis, 46 entries in my wishlist and 31 entries in my shopping cart.

And this is all after I took Skyrim out of my wishlist.
Are you my friend on steam and do you play on hellsgamers?
The_TCR_Engineer: ... who are you on steam? i only have steam

Oh ok

SQUAF GET FREEMAN WERE GONNA KICK YOUR ASS
stupid advertisments i get
though serioulsy, who the hell would run a generator at 150kv
at least
black screen
00,10well it is a genorater set up to power a tram system
seems a bit much
Who getting bit trip 2

chrysalis: Black Mesa, thats who
Black Mesa is pretty much Aperture Science without the comedy when it comes to science really XD
ded

00,10man that latter is gonna be hot
Sumica: thats why he is wearing heat resistant suit
150kv of electricity
REALLY slow carts
00,10she has it set to slow

Is this Half Life 1?
[]DeadpoolDash: we use skype
Black Mesa
00,10just useing skype
who cares water would at least be breaking down at this point
/me takes Sumica into skype
if not on fire
chrysalis: fire bad
00,10might want to talk to wrek about it though
45' incline no change in accelleration or speed
yup, those are some REALLY torquey motors
are you just gonna bitch about video game physica all day? XD
why not
we do it all the time
the only people talking are going to a different game

/me does a spiderman dance
i do what i want
/me takes chrysalis to the movies
no
bad bronysith
but we are seeing the hobbit

/me sprays Bronysith with water
Well if you guys ever switch to a voice comms program/server TeamSpeak3 works pretty well.
not really that interested in the hobbit
understandable
That looks safe
accedentally closed the tab
the only movie i actually WANT to watch at the moment
thats why im forcing you "clockwork orange" style to sit through evangelion 300000 times in a row

chrysalis: no i mean the series
Any word on when Black Mesa goes Gold?

Right on. Well, that's a lie, I played Half life one, but that's the only one.
Ah, I see.
00,10ever notice gordon kills the bosses with science?
00,10he never uses his gun on them
half life was on ps1 as well right
With Science!

Sumica: Because science wins everything
Does he use the Higgs Boson?
/me searches for half life ps1 ROM
00,10I have hl1 on my vita
Damn you net book and your lag >.<
Sumica: orly?
00,10but that's cause ISOs

Who shoots at scientists, I mean really?

Dat payment
so i apparently have something called a ingrown hair and it has become infected. i have to go to the hospital tonight to check on it
brb
sorry to hear that AJTheMightyGamer
I wonder what kind of achievements Steam will add to this once it is downloadable from there
/me is going to go watch freemans mind
Hey everyone.
hi Nittany_Discord
how are things Nittany_Discord and why are you naked
I can't find my clothes.
hey Afflict
mythbusters pretty much proved that you are fairly safe from bullets if you are under water
what will happen if your shot underwater?
hey
BroPony|MEDIC: the bullet wounds will get infected by the waters bacteria
what's up?
oh and the bullets will look like torpedos underwater
But according to mythbusters and []DeadpoolDash you'll be safe, but how?
well, the bullets are unlikely to actually get into the water
they basically shatter on contact with the surface
and lose all their energy
i see
what chrysalis said
pretty useful info
getting shot at,
its basically like concrete
hello
go swimming
and the round shatters
so what you end up with
are flakes and shards
you only have to go a few feet down
to be safe from handgun rounds
ugh
You dissin mah crowbar boy?
which are the most likely to survive the transition into water
How about now hmmmm?
so you guys know feed the beast
theres going to be a feed the brony version
on the official launcher
a shot gun slug might be something to worry about too
So, why did you kill him?
Punishment
for his sins
whats going to be in FTbrony?
00,10Gordont wont stand for no pussies
nothing really, you?
nothing
heh
It's really quiet here for a weekday :P
brb, Gotta test half life
its basically feed the beast
but with mine little pony
but the high velocity rounds from most rifles would break up on impact with the water
and a couple of other tweaks
yup
Who is ready for the new episode !!! of mlp :DD 2 days !!!
also, rumours of rp3 world gen
and the rest coming soon
we don't watch your girly horse show here boy
you'll have to go to the youtubes for that
rp3 world gen, volcanos that actually look like volcanos?
this is...um... half life?
yup
lame isnt it ? we need ponies
black mesa
I'm probably going to have to hold off on watching the next episode until I'm home from Michigan.
PONYS!!!!!!!!!!
naw
go to youtube anon
13oi
we don't need ponys 24/7
:(
13if you want ponies
13go to youtube
so what is the next episode then
13otherwise shut up
didn't i just explain horses aint allowed here?
my emulator makes half life lag
HALF LIFE
Listen to the Toast
LAG
Buytoast, you said it as an anti-brony.
nobody ever heads my words of wisdom
its called BRONYSTATE BRONY <-----
BRONYstate
pony_8654: but we dont stream ponies 24/7 anon
not HORSEstate
brony state is and i quote "not pony upsest"
hey
pony_8759: Not everyone wants ponies all the time.
Hi
^
^^
:3
Whos still going to school here?
ur not true brony's
**** u
lolwut
NOW HOLD ON
/me raises hand
pony_8759: no we arent
/me hugs pony_8759 ;A;
now go away if you dont like it
but YOU are a true nuisance
well you aint a true scotsmen either
13pony_8759: If you're going to be a jackass you can leave.
bronies have more interests than JUST ponites
true bronys don't spend all there time watching ponys
*ponies
Maybe we are true bronies. Maybe you're just too obsessed, pony_8759
umm I ment if you still have more classes before the semester ends
ohh
real men watch G3 bro
lol
so whats up im new
haah G3
then never mind :P
I am
real bronies watch sea ponies too :)
pony_8759: i like ponies as much as the next guy, but damnit i need a break here and there
go play a video games or watch dr. who like us
go to 4chan.com/mlp then
ew dr who
Til the end of the week?
is that...
how about no
some of us have jobs
ADVERTISING?
lolwut
Call me Dr FreePony
that wasnt a link persay...
aw i broke my swiss army knife :(
didnt show up as that at least for me
techinically, he was telling people to go to another website
pony_8759 some of us have jobs
but yeah, either way
13lul then bms crashes
Plus, ponies are so gay and not MLG L3G1T. Scoots would agree with me there.
how long do you get for break?
Derp_Derp: no! DEY TOOK ER JERBS
The only definition of a true brony is one who likes My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and enough to watch every episode. And the people who are more hardcore than that can't honestly strip the less hardcore of the brony label.
hello
nigga,you gay
String_Shredder: queso
welp
13well minecraft is a no go so i guess i will end there
lel kick
or ban
that's rasist
lawl
hl2.exe loves to crash
racist*
Shizuka how comes no go?
Shizuka, thanks for streaming.
wtf just happened
13bms crashed
2 weeks
thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
13and think just good time to end

well thanks for the stream Shizuka
Shizuka: they always do
13and whiny children do not deserve to be catered to
hey guys he's not here
thanks Shizuka, it is that time again :P
flutterfan99: exactly
flutterfan99: what she ment is that the massive whiny kids are coming
what time is it?
thats sort of the point of a ban
hey what happened to the black mesa gameplay?!
scroll up
hell, you shouldn't even need to scroll up
Thats what I had when I was in high school
read
i know i'm just saying he's gone so we should be happy
hl2.exe took a crap
or if you're on lightIRC, reconsider your life choices
tl;dr
Happiness is forbidden.
ya but other whiny kids are coming flutterfan99
winter break is starting
ah
dawwww
been on winter break since november 20th
that would be hell for most of us
feels nice
mine starts tomorrow actually
Buytoast: lucky bastard :I
i blizerd is coming tonight were i live
Buytoast: WOW, what grade are you in?
i'm so pumped
sophomore at the university
flutterfan99: people get banned every day nowadays. its not exactly something to be elated over
one does not simply pick a fav pony
we get a long break
but we get no spring break
well, that sucks
Buytoast: Lucky, mine starts tomorrow and ends on January 2nd
Heya again :
&:)
mine ends on january 5th
Hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
hi MLP_Brovakiin
the world ends on the 21st
bullshit
no it doesnt
it's not
[]DeadpoolDash: according to the Mayan calendar, the world should have already ended
i'm sher he's kidding
^
hi MLP_Brovakiin
the mayan calendar ended cause the spanish raped them
ohey MLG pro
im taking today off.
Scootadash... such an MLG nickname
13so original
^
13not named after show characters at all
Anyway, I hear that someone wanted a pony stream
13completely from your own mind
A 24/7 pony stream
thanks
Scoot-Scootaloo: He was a mad man
Well... it looks like I can fix that
13get to it
Scoot-Scootaloo: He doesn't understand the un-MLGness of ponies.
D:
Scoot-Scootaloo: Yes please?
13they made my black mesa crash because of it
uh oh...
must kill notch
G3.5 Inbound
13herobrine: Must stop RPing.
i sense some monkey's paw bullshit about to happen...
If this gentlemen oh so wants a pony stream..
13Bronystate is not your personal roleplaying channel.
.....what that?
honestly, if the mayans believed cortez was a god, believeing their ass backwards doomsday theory is a bit dunderheaded
Well, you know our motto, we deliver~
/me sits in corner
must kick herobrine
Prepare for mass jimmy rustling
no
MURIKANS deliver no matter what.
/me prepares his jimmies
yes
lol he doesnt even know what RP is
awwww
Buytoast: That was Aztecs. Aztecs believed he was a God. The Mayans left for some reason
well shit
there goes my knowlege
13everyone horribly confuses the aztecs, the mayans, and the inca
the spanish took over the mayans didnt they?
which ones made the flaoting island farms?
those the aztecs too?
>confusing Aztec/Mayans with Incas
why are we talking about this?
idk
I weep for you ;_;
butts
well the Aztecs were a violent bunch, the Mayans were super advanced and shit, and the Incas... well, no one cares for them much
Is that why you dont have laptop on your name?
Because this talk is MLG
yep
/me steall []DeadpoolDash's butt
Shizu: Omg, there was a difference? D:
laptop is in my bag.
The Incas... are forever alone
No one cares :(
THE INCAS ARE STINCAS
when I have laptop in my name, usually it means im at work
lel
XD
when I have [air] in my name, it means im in bed
i feel like i should be worried about something

Hey thelonepony, guess what you burned into my mind and I have been laughing at all day?
i actually just came by shortly to ask something: so, my country (switzerland) is having this annual charity event, organized by the national radio.
MLP_Brovakiin: I dunno, what is it?:P
basically, you pay something, and they play a song for you in the radio
thelonepony: http://i.imgur.com/7eKut.jpg XD

thelonepony: You shareed it yesterday and I laughed so hard I cried :D
MLP_Brovakiin: OH yeah, that XD

Trolling people on Omegle with ponies is cruel, but a lot of fun :D
jcelios: well there's a derivation to it using special relativity formulas, i'd be surprised if you have to actually know it
The Gorilla was reading 2 books - The Bible & The Origina of Species - When the zookeeper got his composure back, he asked the gorilla "Why are you reading those 2 books?"
Socks: Omegle? never been there before

thelonepony: It's like chatroulette where you can be sexually harassed without having to see penis

The Gorilla, in a gentle tone replied "Well my good sir, I wanted to find out if I was my Keeper's brother or my Brother's keeper"

IshPonyPonyPony: ... i'm so gonna do that

Hello everypony :3
I just throw random videos on that account.
i sometimes like those kind too, but i prefer stuff with stars, its nice because its pretty and not distracting

I hate it when it's put randomly
i never see my desktop anyway because i always have something open

I'll keep that in mind

I've seen sexier ones
Hey whats sup everyone
its got one partial pony.

well chrysallis isnt sexy to begin with
so not that hard
Just broke a Windows 7 machine completly
accidently corrupted a few drivers, then the power went out.
"accidently corrupted a few drivers"?
Bronysith, oh yeah you weren't the one obsesses with her....come to think of it where is that guy
Metroid something
she isnt sexy
:P
but the cosplayers somehow make her sexy
haters gonna hate
Considering how extremely tedious the Black Ops 2 emblem maker is, I was impress when I saw this in my lobby. http://i.imgur.com/8eZbc.png

EEEEHHHHHH?
salmon pepperoni... interesting..
hiya all
anything happening?
nope
pretty much all of Yaya Han's cosplay is impressive
holle otakon
hi otakon. i'm admiring this gentlemen's emblem making ability. http://i.imgur.com/8eZbc.png
Humble Bundle 7 I suppose
Ohai otakon :)
XAX: nice I bet [SWAG]Haku made that if Iwere to put forth a guess
Hi otakon :)
hiya thelonecubone, MLP_Brovakiin, texasboykc09
otakon: b-but... the name of the player is at the bottom...
oh.
XAX: Haku
it says haku.
seriously what are the chances of a Derpy badge on a player named Haku while there is ALSO a Haku that comes here?
see it's 1:36pm and i got up half an hour ago, a-and...
yeah yeah
solution: Drink more coffee
MOAR COFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
otakon, well Haku is a character i Naruto
soooooooooooooooo
CrystalPhoenix: yeah but Haku isn't a uncommon name in anime
HOWEVER
then again the character is pretty minor and has been killed very early
wait I forgot
a Haku that likes MLP AND goes to the trouble to make a VERY good badge of DERPY I think takes notice
is Haku a girl or a boy?
boy that looks SO much like a girl it's scary
Anime man
Seriously, Haku DEFINED "trap" for Naruto
even Naruto was shocked
no, he was BEYOND Bishonen
he was a straight up trap
Zabuza was such a cool antagonist
shame he had to be the first
well God
reminds me of that kid from shaman king, one of the characters was hitting on him until he found out he was a he
he's a MOOK compared to what they're fighting now
otakon, I am aware and I don't like them
twilight_sprinkle: was it Ryu? The one with the pompadour?
I liked his character arc
<--- I see Sumi and Shizu took some atleast. :D
too farfetch'd
otakon: ye
13?
I KNEW IT
hiya Shizuka what's up chicken butt?
13[18:44] [ KaiserVordox] <--- I see Sumi and Shizu took some atleast. :D
13?
yeah i remember how in the beginning naruto was like "omg visible chakra thats so incredible" now they have giant chakra skeletons shooting chakra arrows
twilight_sprinkle, that's why Naruto got lame to me
/me flips his desk, lights his computer on fire, and punches several holes in the wall

hey hey hey. Kipkat07_Scarf get some Tequila to calm down man
CrystalPhoenix: it was pretty krabby
CrystalPhoenix: yeah they just went and resurrected everyone like it was nothing
cause heh a main villain character always need something unrealisticaly incredible
I cant beat FTL.... I make it to the last fucking level, the ship is almost destroyed, and my ship expldes.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
so
but now EVERYONE has something unrealistically incredible
whos ready for zombies?
lol
CrystalPhoenix: still, i did enjoy the manga until pains death, pain was an amaing character
so yeah that's why I don't like Naruto
*amazing
naruto sucks
Bronysith: I'm too busy with multiplayer at the moment
Naruto was cool with the first series
like actual ninja in training going to school and shit
naruto sucks
that was fun
/me lays down crying and falls asleep
and the tests they had were great too
especially where they all had to cheat to pass
basically it's like dragonball
nah
the first series was amzing
dragonball is much better than naruto
but then the second one came
aaaaaaaaaaaaaand yeah
I guess it was good for action
the original dragonball was wonderful
still, minus the fillers i found the anime enjoyable, but they shove fillers as memories in every ep now so i gave up on that
if you call screaming at the top of your lung being action scenes
/me crawls to his kitchen to eat himself into a coma of self-pity
and the manga was good until pain died, now its going downhill as well
Ello
hoi Major
Ohai Major :>
zombie ninjas, yes they went there
twilight_sprinkle, I'll say alot of BS right now but
/me carries twilight_sprinkle to bed for some "training"
hello Major
Hi Major
Naruto will end up with Sasuke in romance
/me is sick :<
if that ever happen
I wouldn't even be surprised
Kipkat07_Scarf: I hope you feel better soon buddy! ^-^
CrystalPhoenix: well, they already kissed :P
WHAT
id rather get into Evangelion shipping over naruto shipping
in joke right?
afterall, naruto has horrible fans
but i used to be a naruto fan :<
just like Bronies or homestucks or helliates or skyrimmers
CrystalPhoenix: it was in th e2nd ep
twilight_sprinkle: not my fault they are terrible fans
*the 2nd
yeah
accident
MLP_Brovakiin: Well playing FTL doesnt help. I died on the last level and almost punched a hole in my monitor.
CrystalPhoenix: thats where it all starts~
all fandoms have terrible fans
yeah that doesn't count
Kipkat07_Scarf: Ouch :I
Bronysith, i always knew you were horrible :P
By the way guys
still, one thing naruto was always great was the tricks they used to defeat enemies, it was pretty clever and even used a bit of physics at times
/me takes CrystalPhoenix to bed
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/70734/something-like-feeling pretty cool story
MLP_Brovakiin: It hurt. I had invested about two hours into that single save file.
Bronysith, I'm RP-proof
twilight_sprinkle: it took the yugioh approach with super fucking long overly complicated shit
i like overcomplicated stuff
twilight_sprinkle: like, 5 seconds of action, then 30 minutes of explaining it
gives something to think about
Kipkat07_Scarf: I hate it when that happens :1
twilight_sprinkle: not that there is anything wrong with explanations, but theres such a thing where it hypes up the fight and then it only lasts 5 seconds
twilight_sprinkle: looking at you gaara vs rock lee
Bronysith: that battle was amazing though, even if i must admit they most likely took the idea of lees weights from somewhere else, possibly dbz
twilight_sprinkle: well masashi kishimoto was heavily inspired by dbz
well shite
just near EVERYTHIGN is inspired by DBZ
everything*
/me takes otakon to bed
pfff
/me goes intangilbe
otakon: i think Evangelion has had alot of inspiration too...right?
Bronysith: well narutos character was, other than that i dont think there was much taken from it
otakon, Tokyo mew mew was based off Sailor Moon
twilight_sprinkle: okay let me rephrase
twilight_sprinkle: everything with lots of FIGHTING is practically inspired by DBZ
Naruto. Bleach, One Piece
otakon: only the light shows
twilight_sprinkle: yea, but i didnt care for the characters in naruto, it was just one huge ship fest XD
Bronysith, you have to argue about everything don't ya?
Bronysith, you wanna know a bigger shipfest?
Major: um, this isnt arguing
CrystalPhoenix: hetallia?
MLP?
twilight_sprinkle: and the powering up? and the getting stronger through INSANE training regiments? Yu Yu Hakusho gets inspiration for DBZ
Bronysith: idk, pain was one the most amazing characters ive ever seen, and his philosophies could really work
twilight_sprinkle: oh god, pain
twilight_sprinkle: ooh, what about itachi?
itachi was tragic
My school did pictures for the clubs in my school and I managed to miss 90% of my Algebra class :D
Bronysith: itachi was pretty cool too, but what i really like about pain is that his philosophies could actually be applied irl
otakon: i didnt watch yu yu hakusho
twilight_sprinkle: yea, what were his philosophies again? i havent seen that shit in forever
twilight_sprinkle: well you should
twilight_sprinkle: good show
otakon: how much shit has evangelion inspired?
Bronysith, you're good
/me feels like he's going to throw up ;~;
Bronysith: not sure, ask RX
PASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Kipkat07_Scarf, take deep breaths
Bronysith: basically that pain could unite the world. pain is one of the basic human feelings, something that often controls their behavior. it could be used for good
Bronysith: but thats very basically
theres more to it
twilight_sprinkle: oh yea, he was the head of akatsuki right?
FUCK!!! I forgot to work on my lab report
almost all modern mecha anime has some sort of Eva influences in it
DeadpoolDash: and gundam of course
Bronysith: well, SPOILERS AHEAD he wasnt truly the head
Kipkat07_Scarf: better go do it
Bronysith: he was made to think he was
DeadpoolDash: even though the Evas arent actually robots >.>
twilight_sprinkle: holy shit
twilight_sprinkle: im pretty gay for tragic characters though, thats why i love itachi and zuko
Bronysith: well, actually it depends on what you mean by leader, he actually was aware of the secret plan of akatsuki, but not of everything about himself
and also of course, THE man, Andrew Ryan
still, alot of the mecha genre uses design and various character types from Eva
Bronysith: naruto has truckloads of tragic characters, there were almost no purely evil characters there at all :D
they all had motive
(most of them being village raid
Bronysith: hm, didnt know it was him. orochimaru has some great themes too
twilight_sprinkle: yea, but i dont like how he talks, too, fucking calm
he never raises his voice XD
CrystalPhoenix: well, they Were born during a war, which they understand, and another great theme of the show is the circle of hate thing
i like how kakashi is still alive, not OP at all, but hes one of the most useful characters still
twilight_sprinkle: i like how he was a jonin at 12 or some shit like that
and also how he watched his best friend die in front of him
Bronysith: or even 9 or something
holy shit he went through alot of stuff
Screw MLP merchendise I'll go victorian now http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/watches.php
Bronysith: actually it turned out to be ever twistier than watching his friend die
Bronysith: what actually happened is SPOILERS IJQINDMIQOWNMDQ he killed his friend
twilight_sprinkle: he pushed the boulder ontop of obito?
Bronysith: oh you meant obito, well no, he didnt. but he killed his other teammate
Bronysith: he got surrounded and it was the only way to protect the data, so he killed her, and its even twistier than that
okay
Kakashi, is a worse person than gendo ikari
idk, i somewhat agree with what he did, he chose the village over 1 person, it made sense
twilight_sprinkle: he pulled a spock XD
Bronysith: never watched startreck much :P
needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few twilight_sprinkle
yep
twilight_sprinkle: thats all i know of the original series of star trek XD
twilight_sprinkle: well that and "KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN"
Bronysith: i saw a few eps as a kid but dont remember much
twilight_sprinkle: i need to watch the next generation >.>
ello everypony :$
Bronysith: also, when kakashi killed his teammate, he pretty much became the reason for the war

CrystalPhoenix: well ill see tv world after i get a vita

Bronysith, you have a PS2?
dead island was pretty fun.... used about half of my weapons on the final boss
CrystalPhoenix: spoil anything for me and i will do to you what 4kids did to one piece
Bronysith, do you have a PS2?
posion suction cups?
or maybe you played Persona 3 on PSP
CrystalPhoenix: yea i have a ps2, but my brother took it to college
aaaaw
that sucks
then how are you playing Persona 3?
CrystalPhoenix: PSN
i need games for my ps2 :/
on PS3
I see
the PSN on ps3 is a beautiful thing
all the games
and I suppose your PS3 doesn't have backward compatibility
CrystalPhoenix: of course it doesnt XD
I need to get PS3 ;3;
and a better computer as well
Bronysith, be careful about what you're saying
CrystalPhoenix: i kind of wish they had persona 4 on the PSN, i mean they have Persona 3 FES
I have a PS3 that has Backward compatibility
lucky ur ps3 has it :I
CrystalPhoenix: lemme test it right now then
CrystalPhoenix: popping in armored core 2
Bronysith, only the early models could
Ah ps3
if it's a slim it can't play PS2
http://i.imgur.com/bZebu.jpg Oh my~
some phat can't
but others can
You'll soon be replaced by ps4
thelonecubone: lel

CrystalPhoenix: nope
Bronysith, it's a slim right?

damn, now you reminded me that i need to watch it
implying sumi is trolling
You just watched it now Sumica?
Though the goblin CGI is pretty bleh, that much is true.
00,10too damn long and they never even finishe what they start out to do.
Sumi troll is best troll
So it's just like Fellowship then?
*zing*
00,10nah lower mortality rate
Well, do any of those damn dwarves die in the book?
Sumica: They spent long enough filming it here.
I can't even remember
00,10they totaly riped off lord of the rings too.
'cuz I could do without about half of them
00,10they did't even try to hide it
00,10useing like the same names and shit
See? Troll :p

this remind me of anecdote which is too long to type out
00,10my only complant is wtf do they put in the soda to make me have to pee so damn much
^ Dat image pretty good
Too long, they end up making almost no real visible progress, and it's a mix of long character development and action slashed together.
Sumica: me
All of which were things that Fellowship did. So....I thought it was pretty par for the course. But the goblin CGI....why.
Waynebradeygonahavetochokeabitch
Oh please Celestia can i be That Person
Sumica They put pee in your soda.
flutterchu: im sure it would be easier to ask molestia
The Uruk-Hai were BAWS. Why you use visibly weaker CGI for goblins. D:
XD

Wow. That was sick
flutterchu: for you just have to do a "favor" for her

BATTLEAXE!

Funny, the only time I keep seeing this movie is near the ending where _ *censored* and *censored*....at least I get to see the beginning :)
otakon: why would i cut down a tree?
Bronysith: bc it's ATTACKING YOU
00,10weapons are for pussies, real men punch trees
Sumica: but TREE'S
ThunderBlaze, you'll sooner break the sword than the tree. It takes and axe to cut down a tree.
What movie is this?
otakon: fluttershy doesnt attack people silly
Because you're a maniac
Sumica: alligator pawnch
Bronysith: good point

The game will include the same story of all the 6 originally planned games, so nothing story related will be altered during the switch. The gameplay style however has changed a lot for the switch. Including a level up system, more attacks than ever before and the largest free-roaming world than any other Spyro game. Play as both Spyro and Cynder during battl
hes 26?
holy fuck
best kinda drunk Sumica

One thing about this song-- Someone has some VERY VERY odd ideas about gift giving.
John Denver and the Muppets. This... isn't quite as familiar to me.
5 gold rings? She must got them from sonic
/me confesses that one of the things that scared him most as a child, and still gives him massive shivers, is old audio that warbles and wavers and sounds horrible, it actually causes him fear
and gnomes on a pine treeee~
i crashed
Noone knows? D:
trick question
it's all gnomes
AND A PEAR ON A PARTRIDGE TREE!
BAMUP BUM BUM
12 days of ponies
Fail
Fozzie's forgetting his lines
And here come the old geezers to make fun of him
13but i already played the john denver muppets :<
all matter is made up of tiny gnomes, the movement of the "tectonic plates" is actually a giant rock concert where surface gnomes crowd-surf on the excited magma gnomes
00,10you had better sound Shizuka but this has video
SuperBrony64: Scrubs version?
you can sometimes hear these concerts when two of these groups mash up together, and the bands just start to "jam", this causes and uproar in sound and the motion of the gnomes which we experience as an earthquake
Innate, that first one made my mom laugh... me to.
00,10ow my ears
This is how Chewie celebrates Life Day
:P

...er the day after tomorrow.
00,02its tomorrow for me
I guess 'Beat Fishin'' is a reference to old school hip-hop, right?

its capable of lifting the last stage in to interplanetary space
00,10useing t-c4n
we will be using it to build a space station
Phase4, you mean the result of many Kerbal deaths
00,10all those power packs
their bodies were donated to science
AdamTheDuck, that too
00,10lawl
For science!
00,10just last week CR guys were saying they never saw top gun

Eww Phase4 has clothes
Nakked Phase4 is best Phase4
how has no one seen top gun?
00,10guess i quit streaming just a bit too early
00,10cause now every one is comeing in
00,02i have not planned this station
00,10also why the tiny battire packs Phase4?
never seen top gun
it wasn't your stream, it was what you were streaming.
aint that the airplne movie?
00,02Sumica, no solar cells, upper stage needs it
people resource not worth
00,02the lower one has it so i can deorbit it
00,02less space debris
ces*
00,10dont you get the power you need from the C&C?
00,02XD
00,02Sumica, thats a good point
00,02i have no idea why i put them there
00,10I look forward to watching space docking
00,10shame they dont have cowlings yet for ships
00,10you know so you can reduce drag
00,02yeah
00,02i imagine that will be implimented
00,10saw some early mods with em

00,10that module you jist stuck the batterys on
00,02oh
00,02yeah, one for the tug and one for the station
00,10was wondering the point of that module
so much blue
00,02i broke it
00,10yup
00,10good job hero
00,10seems stable
00,02clearly i must launch two space stations to balance it out
looks like a robot holding something
00,10I think it's not working cause that bit is already a coupler
00,10I cant even land on the moon with out cratoring
00,10and here you are seting up for a space station
00,02:3
00,10then again I still have to learn the oribatal mecanic all over again
00,10wait you can precision rotate now?
00,02looks safe
00,02Sumica, hold shift, i think its allways been there
00,02i only found it recenrly
00,10hmm

00,10go figure
SPAAAAACE!!!
00,10damn phas you need to clear old wreckage
00,02have to launch fast or it explodes
00,02Sumica, i forgot to do that :(
00,10man that rocket looks angry
00,02don't ask me why this hasnt exploded
00,02this launch is going against everything i know
00,02120KM seem ok?
So much colour o.o
00,10seems ok for a parking orbit
00,10that is somthing i still need to master
00,10the roll manuver for oribtal insertion
00,10cool desgine I might add
13http://i.snag.gy/dDIZe.jpg this makes me happy :)
00,02damn, burned too much
00,02Shizuka, yay~
00,02the orbital insertion stage is practically full
00,02i built this rocket to be capable of launching entire fuel talks to other planets
00,02so time to dump it and use the nuke engines
00,10wait there is stock nuke engines?
00,02the atomic ones
00,02LV-N
00,10oh they are still trying to make that coneection
do these guys not make notes before talking? it would make them so much better
00,02good enough
00,02the station is now in orbit
this was the 4th of july free dlc for gh3

00,02what the heck is going on in celestia radio
00,10oi

KrazyNoobs, Phase be streaming tonight
okay
Cannot you tell from the Kerbal death simulator?
Or KSP as Phase calls it, but I prefer death simulator
I know, he is not the only admin that does KSP, though
But Sumi will usually have Sumipony when he streams anyway
i dont wear my seatbelt on the bus while going to work or going home from work :P
but on fieldtrips i do..
Buses here don't have seatbelts :P
its a disability bus
xD
I know when Wrek and Sumica are streaming by the icons, I just think all the streaming admins should use some sort of icon that indicates who is streaming.
you are suppose to wear your seatbelt but..
Phase4, oi, where's Phasepony?
00,02AdamTheDuck, not working :(
You can't navigate throught space without the help of Phasepony Phase4 :<
im a bad girl for not wearing mine D:
aniderp|bestcakeever, feeling rebellious ey? :P

OCs are wierd things... I have drawn so many, but I don't know which one I like most...
Oh I know that feel oh too well

Eeeeee, the latest issue of the only manga I read just arrived at my house yesterday. Imma read it today. :D
Have fun Gold_Demona :P
/me AdamTheDuck that is not proper behavieor
therainbowvortex, but it's HAPPENING D:
i know me to yay
Gold_Demona: which manga? :3
MadSurge: Dogs: Bullets & Carnage
Gold_Demona: sounds fun
Gold_Demona: sounds like a laughing riot :D
It's dark and gritty and really frickin violent, but I love the characters. :D
therainbowvortex, hege, 1 minute till it's the 21st for you therainbowvortex :P
hehe*
omg its so close to crishmas
So is friendly fire on in this game?
MadSurge, eeyup
so be cautious of your fire.
AdamTheDuck: and now its the 21st
Someday I need to draw some fanart of this manga. I need to practice drawing humans. :P
AdamTheDuck: I'd be a total disaster then :D
therainbowvortex, welp,end of the world now XD
oh fuck
dam it
So much swearing Sumi :P
AdamTheDuck: My fav passtime in TF2 is spraying people with fire, friend or foe :D
AdamTheDuck: i just called my friend and his mum went pysco
"<therainbowvortex> kia ora every pony" Where abouts in NZ are ya?
XAX: dunedin why
work was cancelled due to this nasty blizzard, so I came here
therainbowvortex: Ah. Timaru reporting in.
Ehmahgerd guize eet's teh edn of the wurld tumarrao
MadSurge, D:
oh noes
XAX: yr my nz i was starting to think no one down here was
damnit, and I bet I'm delicious to boot
XAX: yr from nz i was starting to think no one down here was
AdamTheDuck: when do you think the next end of the world alarm will ring? :D
The year 3000, because holograms aren't y3k compatible.
Or wait no. Robots. We'll have true AI robots by then, and they'll all go nuts cuz they're not y3k compatible.
MadSurge, obviously in AD 2101
War was beginning
AdamTheDuck: :D PERFECT
and somebody will set us up the bomb
war, war never changes
i dont want the world to end i like the world
AdamTheDuck: I did play that game incidentally :D
And then all your base are belong to KATS
MadSurge, is the game actually any good? :D
Yeah actually
It's one of those top0view spaceship shooters
top-view*
I might check it out later
With the self-scrolling levels and the waves of bafd guys to shoot
bad*
/me moves the ZIG
Gold_Demona: actually it's side view, kinda like R-Type
That's the ship you're flying in the game. a Zig :D
Oh yeah, it's side-view. Same gameplay though
Just horizontal instead of vertical
Yeah, it's a decent shooter
The guys that made it, Toaplan, eventually became Cave and invented bullet hell games :D
I think it's be one of those horribly forgotten games if not for the terrible translation in the intro. XD
it'd*
All them typoes this morning
/me makes Gold_Demona a coffee :P
Glad I'm not writing any fic right now, or I'd have typoes everywhere. :D
Ooh! Coffee!
/me drinks da coffee
Sankyoo Ducky. :)
Gold_Demona: ever tried italian coffee? Tiny cups, but gives a hell of a kick I'm told :D
Like espresso? :D
Ayup
Never had espresso. Don't really need that much caffeine. XD
lol
Sleep?
What is sleep?
Yeah espresso is typically served in a shot cup. XD
AdamTheDuck: it's the action of laying down and closing your eyes :D
o.o
ohai
If that's what sleep is, I do that with my eyes open
Hello Alchemist
No, sleep is an acid trip minus the acid. :D
I passed an exam yesterday
Alchemist: Yay!~ Congrats
Awesome, which exam Alchemist? :P
Part of the exam was to turn in a paper. Out of the 25 points I got 30. My paper was 20% cooler :D
Polymer chemistry and technology
Are there achievements in PS2?
MadSurge, none at the moment
Oh
Don't think they are going to add any though
its a shame that PS2 is a bit more demanding than an average game
Alchemist: you rock! Woohoo! :)
The developers said they wanted to put most of their time into fixing bugs rather than adding new content
MadSurge: thx :)
Alchemist, indeed, it's very unoptimised at the moment.
Ooh, and I forgot to say congratulations Alchemist :P
AdamTheDuck: most people say that it was okay during the beta. What changed?
and thanks :)
im baaaack
wait
brb
Alchemist, more people? .-. Not sure, I don't notice much change fromt he beta
/me parachutes into the chat, violently sick
/me violently throws his rusty kitchen knife at parachuting Kipkat07_Scarf
uughhhhhh I dont like being sick :<
I thought that in an online game more players only tax the bandwith and not the processor performance. (Im a retard when it comes to comp tech so I dont know).
I think I'll have some coffee for real. brb
Alchemist, yes, but to load that many people on a screen at once can put a strain on the performance
ponyshrug.jpg
yum.
Like I said, I don't really notice a difference in performance since beta
I haven't had lift+ in a while.
quite a while...
doesnt matter, I should get a new PC anyways if I want to play with any game that came out past 2010 :D
Alchemist: My old desktop can't run anything past 2006
STEP IT UP
XAX: yeah, too bad I dont have ~1000$ for a decent config. :(
:(
I'm going to have to miss school because of this fucking sickness :(
Kipkat07_Scarf, isn't that a good thing? :P
Kipkat07_Scarf: is that good or bad?
not in high school
and I have two labs I have to do today and teh lab report is due tomorrow
what kind of labs?
chemistry
:)
/me hops around the chat like a bunny rabbit
Making zap apple jam, aniderp|bestcakeever?
/me lays down and groans because he wants to throw up but cant
I ate a rabbit once.
wasnt that asty
tasty
maybe :P
Alchemist: I've always wanted to try rabbit. What's it taste like?
Does it taste like chicken? :$
It tasted more like boar meat if you ever tried that.
I wonder what human tastes like
/me nibbles on Jaymoo's arm
But the bunny it was from was old and maybe that was the problem.
Rabbit is quite good, but I prefer sticking to steaks
Chicken and turkey for me. Maybe a well done steak on occasions.
and potatoes
in any form
and quantity
Potatoes
mmmmmm
Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew
turky is nom
Sadly the only meats I've had are chicken, turkey, pork, and beef.
Gold_Demona: no seafood?
I also want to try kangaroo one day o.o
Alchemist: I wasn't sure if you counted seafood
sea ponies!
in that category I've had all kinds of stuff
Gold_Demona: well, its technically meat too.
/me grabs Gold_Demona to dance
Technically, but some folks for some reason don't count seafood as meat. :P
I didnt know that. Strange.
Yeah
Gold_Demona: wanna muffin?
aniderp|bestcakeever: sure =D
So it's wild animal meat you want to try or something more exotic?
There are some vegetarians who eat seafood because they don't consider it as meat
Ikr, fish are made of meat
/me gives muffin and puts sea ponies on
AdamTheDuck: what? thats nonsense.
Alchemist: Pretty much anything that isn't the four meats I've mentioned. I love all four of them, but I wanna try all kinds of other meats.
Meat is an expensive commodity though. =/
I want to eat veal again
Only the good kind is expensive
never had veal. Just regular beef
i want pizza rolls or a hot dog
I have no idea what animal veal is, but damn it was good
tortured little baby cow
veal is baby cows
AdamTheDuck: baby cow
D:

Not baby Ess Bee's! D:

That blows.
And Im missing school ;~;
As for me, I've been coughing so much from this flu that my throat's starting to feel like it's been flayed repeatedly.
It's kinda painful, even with pain meds in my system. >.<
The flu sucks and should go die.
Ive been coughing too >_< If I cough when I vomit... projectile vomiting /).(\
DO. NOT. WANT.
/me hugs SuperBrony64
Still going to work though. I refuse to let this goddamn bug keep me in bed all week. Who the hell does this flu think I am?!? :|
I wish I could go to school but I dont want to be the person who throws up all over the keyboard in computer tech
Oh, speaking of work, it's that time.
Yeah, probably best to wait until you've broken your fever at least.
Bye CriticKitten
That'll cut down on how contagious you are too.

I'm kinda hard to shop for, so I'd be surprised if anybody got me anything. :P
does your husband usually get you something?
If in doubt buy a whip. Worked for me.
Plus most folks who usually buy me stuff are kinda po' right now, so I don't think I'd want them getting me anything anyhow.
Well okay o.o
haha
aniderp|bestcakeever: He does when he can find anything to give me. :P
Like I said, I'm hard to shop for

the Skyward Sword version was the best one
08,01afternoon, hornystate
00,02game crashed :(
08,01nope
lol aw
this thing is looooonnnnnngg Java lol
08,01i have no libido today, and am zactually incapable of feeling sexual pleasure at the moment as a side effect of pain meds
aw thats pretty lame :c
08,01(you did ask)
Yeah I dont regret it ^_^
08,01and believe me, o've tried
08,01for hours.
08,01ANYHOOS
you need a hug, a warm meal and another hug
08,01i'm tryiong to blag my way into computing conferences
hows that going?
08,01quite well; ive got me and my brother free tickets to Scotch On The Rocks
awesome!
nooo stream went offline..
XD >mfw the author is trying to disprove their OC isn't a mary sue and it further proves the point X
00,10rawr
00,10much engi farming
/me raises his arms
Sumica, what game?
00,10planet side 2
00,10wrek was playing Imadoor try and open me
00,02you have to love a game where 50 man teams hold out a base
00,02actually there was probably a lot more than 50
00,02if you count all the ground and air troops
00,10yeah it was crazy
I can't wait to play this with you guys
Hahaha.
/me ponders playing FTL
00,10but I was hideing out behind wrek keeping him alive
00,02everythings far too expencive though
00,10engi is a MAX's best friend
the in game stuff?
00,02yeah
I almost had an anyuerism last time I played FTL... hmmm....
00,10just work slowly at it phase
I bet, then again that the whole point of F2P :/
00,02i'm sure its cheap to buy certs (or whatever you buy) but still
00,10but notice how good the bonuse was cause we were a full squad
00,02it feels like they're trying to cheat money out of me by putting a price on all the good stuff
00,10and roughly 150exp is one cert
00,10what class do you like most Phase4?
You guys wanna run the factions by me real quick? I kinda forgot em
00,10NC TR and VS
which do you all play?
00,02and the multiple character feature is mostly pointless, you need far too many certs to get anywhere and its a linear gain regardless of your rank :/
00,10New Congolmerate, Terren republic and Vanu Soventry
00,02Sumica, engi so far
00,10we ar NC
I found this thread on the FTL Game Hub on Steam where someone will gift a copy of FTL to anyone who writes out a good short story. What I didn't read is that the guy already called it quits with the givaway. So I wrote something out, and his next reply is him wanting to find a better way of conveying that THE GIVEAWAY IS OVER.
00,02i suck at aiming though so non combat classes are best for me
00,10well the aiming is shit for most NC guns
00,02though i usually end up shooting a bunch of stuff anyway
00,10they kick like a mule
even with a steady hand?
and burst
00,02Sumica, yeah but i'll miss with the spread at point blank
00,10with engi guns you want to cert in to forward grip and Compensater if you use the sights
00,02my mousepad with that games mouse sensetivity, i'm that bad
00,10if you want to shoot from the hip use the laser dot on the rail
i cant even fly ._. every attempt end as crash
00,02^
00,02that too
this game is so detailed o,o
00,10aye flying takes a certen kind of player
00,02mouse to roll is absurd and whoever thought that was a good idea should be shot
yeah
00,02plus whichever the red guys are seem to have much better hardware
would you say its harder than Battlefield aerial controls?
00,02never played battlefield
00,10I can fly a lib and gal ok but a reaver(esf) is a no go
bf has way better flying control
00,02i could probably pilot a gal if only because its slower
00,02more time to compensate for silly controls
00,10be got a few rocket podders in squad that are slick with esf's
This game looks like its gonna eat up all my time haha
its just massive
00,02it is absurdly large
00,10you should see what I do with a Gal phase
But thats good, I wanted something to breathe new life into FPS titles like this
So does every hexagon have a control tower or what?
00,10I can make them do loops and shit
00,10not every hex
*just like this
00,10some bases controll upwards of 10 hexes
Aaah
this is what MAG wanted to be haha
00,02theres still a lot of bases
and could not accomplish
what game are you even talking about
Moira planet side 2
PS2?
00,02and each base may have several smaller bases around it that you can capture to spawn vehicles
00,10you cant advance your controll with out a connecting hex or god levels of patances
00,02anyway, reboot time
00,10larger bases have upwards of 4 points to control as well as outlien depos that you dont have to own to capture but are helpfull
00,10such as span points and tank termnals
Like a secondary capture point basically?
05back with lunch
What's for lunch, Wrek?
05a simble hamburger
00,10back in beta the side points were part of the base but it was a bit much
awye
00,10as a troop could capture the 4 outside bases and take over with out ever entering the center compound
It seems like a more balanced game now cause of it. You risk going for a smaller point, you get and edge for succeeding
goodnight everyone
*an
night Mutterguy
00,10side bases often have a port in to the mane base
oh Wrek i have question for you, cause i have new tablet and its great, but when i try to join paintchat to try it out, i cant recivelog D:
oh so they become connected as well?
05i know nothign about the paintchat
00,10often a good tatic is to have the "zerg" go for the main base and smaller squads such as ours will hit the side bases to cut the enemy off
00,10ask Phase4 about the painchat
okay c:
This game is impressing me so much and I haven't even touched it yet
dat music :D

08,01i said to him, "next thing you'll be telling me you don't know the first two laws of thermodynamics"
What am the sky? How does eat food?
08,01"why would i know the first two laws of thermodynamics?" he said
/me doesn't know the first two laws of thermodynamics....
08,01"*everyone* should know the first two laws of thermodynamics,"i replied
08,01i then broke into song
08,01and taught the whole class the first two laws of thermodynamics, Flanders and Swann style.

Serenity: I like it, but it doesn't have a massive plot like the others and has a bizarre attack system :D
plus, it was available

Because he's the ACTUAL character, stuck inside the real world
MadSurge: I heard it was piss-easy. Is that true?

My nick?
yeah
And what band? >.<
Serenity: well it's hard to get a game over :D
I guess not then Havok

so we will be fine XD
but just in case, i have my baseball bats
wrek they will contuin to tak about how the world dident end
It's very close to 21st in Aussiegrit
Universe works on EST
Everybody should be in the streets and play friday
well the Calender ended in June
since Leap Years didn't exist then
08,01hoepfully15
The old calender was 10 months and 30 days in a year
actually
the world runs on UTC
so we got another 6/5 hours
The Multiverse runs on Unix time
08,01Serenity: but that doesn't make sense, because a day and a year are of fixed length
hi guys i am in the middle of a blizzerd right now
Ello there everybrony.
oh what is this!?
HaI EVERYPONY
they add leap seconds which adjusts the length of a day
Like 1000 years ago
flutterfan99: Are you in north murica?
and leap days to adjust a year
08,01chrysalis: astronomically speaking, i mean
yes i'm in MURICA!
We're mostly British here
i think the actual date was June 6th or something close to that
Yeah. Been watching that blizzard
Its crazy
again, we are slowing down
I need to point out a major error you guys made in the newsletter http://imgur.com/NJqRE
so while its a predictable constant change
First day of winter is going to be crazy
we are still changing the length of a day
08,01though actually, there are two lengths of a day: a synodic day and a sidereal day
Barbetos|FinalDAY: not only is it the start of winter, but also a full moon
ded
so the world "ends" tomarow
Well that explains the bulges... in my pants.
Sunrise wasn't until quarter past 8 in England
AND A NEW ONE....wil rise
08,01the former refers to the day wrt. the sun, and the latter to the day wrt. the stars
will*
And sundown was at 3
Barbetos|FinalDAY: want me to relieve you of that?
but yea, everyone drop your stuff at my house i have a bunker that will protect it
ok what is this!?
only room to fit one person though
End of the world? I will take what I can get.
08,01a synodic day is 1/365.25 less than a sidereal day
08,01iirc
15 minutes until the big sale begins!
/me joins Dark92Enigma
For the leap year thing
big sale?
Why not just make seconds last a little longer?
Okay, NOW it's 15 minutes
08,01IshPonyPonyPony: this tuesday just past
like santa claus starring tim allen?
then why'd i get the newsletter today and not monday?
oh yea

Y-Y-YOU'RE JUST A H-HATER!
lol
in all serisniss it's the best cartoon i have eer seen
meh
what a sad life you've lived
I dunno, I think the new eps are on par with the earlier ones.
i'm not joking
animaniacs is much better than MLP
Bronysith: or Samurai Jack
and batman the animated series
i've never herd of it Bronysith
flutterfan99: youve never heard?
of
wait flutterfan99
animaniacs?
you never heard of Animaniacs
the greatest animated show ever?
again
what a sad life you've lived
Buytoast: kill him
05"yawn*
Bronysith this generation is full of sad sad little children
Wrek we need some Animaniacs pronto
the children needs education
i'm sorry what channel is it on i'll watch it
Zamer: good thing the word will end then :)
hmm wrek
flutterfan99 it's not on any channel
world
it was a show from the 90's
I mean, animaniacs isnt my favorite show, but it is probably the best animated show ever
you like challeng in doom wrek
the Hub plays it
along with Pinky and the Brain, Freakazoid, Dexter, Johnny Bravo, Samurai Jack
beat the game with only the fist and pistol wrek
ok i'm going to go rethik my life aperintly
only the movie jcelios
JRP2234: hes beat it on the hardest difficulty with no strafing
oh and Dexter's lab was awesome too, and the PPG :)
using the pistol
what a sad challenge you put before yourself
want a real challenge? Beat ninja gaiden on master ninja difficulty while taking NO damage whatsoever
using the pistol only, no strafe and get 100% kills/secret
/me wants to see Wrek vidmaster Marathon games
which again, is near impossible, taking no damage in any ninja gaiden game is already hard enough
unless ninja gaiden 3, that one sucks
!!!!
is it even possible to not get hit in ninja gaiden
!!!!
oooh marathon
/me dies
alexxm if you are good enough
Wreky~ ^_^
For those that play Planetside 2: Smed has announced that the 21st is 3x SC day, and 2x xp till january 2nd
Bungie.

our
so Wrek , who made marathon?
Developer: Bungie
bungie? seriously??
Yes. Seriously
yeah, why not?
they made game before Halo you know :(

05chapter 2: failed
05feck

I used to hate the rising lava in that level as a kid
i think i need to fire up some persona 3
05feck
now its getting real XD
now is he holding a grenade or does he just have big meaty hands?
weird cyborg iron knuckles
wow the power went out fora second
Lol. Rising Lava
so it seems steam winter sale is live
commence with the spending :)
Hi everypony...It's currently the Dawn Of The Second Day, and there's 48 Hours Remaining.
VenHur: Hi!
05FUCk
ouch
/me claps for venhur's refrince
05never managed to vid past chpater 2
Wrek: are you rage quiting?
So this is a DOOM modification?
^blasphamy
/me sets VenHur on glorious fire
VenHur: don't get upset about being on fire... i thought the same thing
FIYAH! FIYAH! FIYAH! IMMUH OUN FIYAH!
i've never herd of this game so i don't know of it's a good stratgy but why are you using the glove insted of a gun?
its a challenge
fists only
ok
05no health
05no save
Well, it's a game played just like DOOM...or rather a modification of it.
05onyl fists
05and wrong
05they play completly differently
in some ways it reminds me of heretic
No health...No save points...Only your bare hands and wits...
Wrek: Whats your skill in this Game? (With Fists Only)
...Welp, this game is hard.
it's more like your bare feet, from the looks of it
Nah, it's really his knuckles.
eli: what?
flutterfan99: he rarely uses his fist... he just runs
Eli oh ok
"help my mission to get marijuana banned"
so what we playing
uhhh… maybe look at the law....
welp my father just successfully become owner of a tavern
Marathon (Game)
uhhh... nice health
You know, the last couple of E3s we had is just not...well...impressive...expect Pikmin 3 and Rayman Legends.
What. Did they suck?
05problem with this level is
05that its an extermination level
05you cant really vid it
Wrek: Whats your Skill?
E3 has been a joke for years
05skill?
05its runnign on total-carnage ofc
Nah, not really, it just lost "it's charm". More simply, there's hardly any moments where people stands up and screams/cheers like if all hell breaks loose.
getting shot. it's a good skill
the kinect has been a joke for years
IIRC marathon was the first FPS with duel weilding, secondary fire and a primative form of "jumping"
2 Years.
etc.
don't forget Nintendo's naming skills
But damn, if Rareware ever comed back to Nintendo, that "all hell breaks loose" thing I mentioned would of comed true.
That, or a new F-Zero.
btw i fell bad for not knowing what animaniacs was
i would find it hard to see a new F-Zero game or a revival
What if Microsoft Closes down Rareware before Nintendo buys the company back?
^Blaspehy!
*Blasphemy!
lies
VenHur that made me think of ygs
05ill be hoenst
uded
05i never thought id beat that last level
05with all those troopers
Try One Hit Death mode.
lol lag
05hm?
Is it just me or is the game Lagging out?
05Uboa-San: whadda ya mean one hit death mode
Wrek: Where one Hit from an enemy kills you instantly
and were off air
05there has never been such a thing
Wrek: the Stream. It's off Air.
new conversation time, Fav disney animated movies?
05i know
05its my internet deprin up
05but as i said
05there is no such mode
Lol.
Unless there is a mod for It
If there was a mod for it, it probably would be Wrek. Oh, wait, wrong kind of mod.
It would be One hit Death Mode.
pretty sure there are points in the games where its impossible not to take a hit
05ok think i fixed the derpage
Wrek Sessions?
good news everypony, i ve beaten the MLP Game
which one?
the gameloft one, the one for the phone
Squallken: you got luna?
no
now go beat that dating one
05gotta try this...
Squallken: whaat? i thought you get her when you beat the game... now i don't wanna play it anymore
I beat Nightmare moon
hi. get what when beat what game?
TWILY <3
Classic Mode? That reminds me of Windows 95.
you mean there is more to DO?
Squallken: screw nightmare moon. I want Luna
Squallken: well, Luna is in the Album
but not in the store
Eli: which game you guys talking about?
the gameloft on
Wrek: Nice Wallpaper!
one*
falus alarm, i guess i have days to slave away at this game
false*
Squallken: :P
you mean that app?
ok i'm somwhat new here what is this?
i meen the stram
Dark_Horst: yeaps
unless there was a way to get everything at the speed of light
Im guessing the streamer is preparing content. flutterfan99
This is Wrek, trying to start playing a game, so we can watch him either be totally aewsome or fail in ways we dare not comprehend.
Dark92Enigma-: it's one of these funny little time-waster games. but it has ponies.
Squallken: taking away the Higgs Field should do it
just saw a guy named fallenalikorn in planetside
first non-outfit contact
though time would not pass for anything aka not exist
Higgs Field?
what gives things mass
oh
things with zero mass travel at c
whos stremming?
so... photons have zero mass?
streaming*
Does anyone else experience lag when switching to full screen of ustream. I am troubleshooting issues with flash and ustream seems to be the only thing giving me problems.
Kencolt: yup
ill be bbl, got to slave away at gameloft game
once read that photons are basically packets of lightwaves
nvm, warcraft 2 is on
warcraft2
nice.
ERMEGERD
ERMAHGERD.
WerCroft Worl?
*has Warcraft3 frozen throne*
/me fangasm
Snow: adorable ^w^
whoever is streaming, you want warcraft 3 frozen throne cracked? and ready?
We have come a long way as far as graphics.
I demand warceaft II expansion!
The streamer is Wrek.
I am back! :$
Squallken: did you ever notice, when Derpy throws away her cover, the "eyes" stay on the box?
Wrek: you want warcraft3 frozen throne?
@Eli No...no i have not
*Warcraft 3
Squallken: I knew derpy's eyes are werid, but this...
strange
hlaf screen?
The Half-Screen. Bow before It!

oh mai god!

dem nostalgia
Favourite Assassin's Creed Game? Mine's AC2
AC2 is the same as AC1
Snow: I'd be willing to bet he's already got it. Wrek seems to have almost every game ever, and if he doesn't, SB64 does.
Only with a Different story.
my dad bought it in switzerland when he was on a businesstrip and we got it in german.
Alchemist: never try to get any game in english over here... doesn't work
AC2 is the same game as AC1, yet people bitch all about AC1
Eli: even games that offer multi language installs by default?
Alchemist: almost no game has it. and even then, it's like half of the game is english, the rest stays german
Bronysith: no insane people shoving you around and less annoying beggars will do that
Alchemist: sometimes the voices turn english, or part of the inventory
Alchemist: it can be so freaking annoying
Eli: Usually that's the fault of a second party localiser.
bll
bbl*
Eli: and why is that? Are the swiss this over patriotic? :D
Alchemist: ...I would love to say no, but that probably only counts for me. Yes. Yes we are overly patriotic.
I lived in Basel for 3 years when I was a kid. I have no memories like this neither did my parents bring this up.
Alchemist: but it's also the fault of the extremly paranoid capitalist sytem over here. they seem to try to keep all our money behind our own borders.
Did I see Warcraft 2 earlier?
ah, Switzerland... known to the rest of the world mostly for fondue, chocolate, banks, and a serious pack of bad-asses who keep the Pope breathing in bad situations-- the world's smallest and toughest standing army, the Swiss Guard.
it's almost impossibly hard for me to ship stuff or simply get it from somewhere else (where it's only half the pirce)
*price
Kencolt: don't get me started on the swiss army. the guard's ok, but most of them are frenchies
Kencolt: and Top Secret Drum Corps http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVdnMAGIt8
Eli: And the Guardss in the Vatican anyhow, I know...
Eli: Then considering who they are guarding...
Kencolt: eh... other than most of my country, (and family) I'm not religious
05should be up and runnign in 10 mintues
Kencolt, I've always known Switzerland for their Hot Chocolate, mountains, clockwork, multi-purpose tools, tax sheltering, and NEVER getting involved in wars.
my folks are only religious on paper. they dont really practice it.
Eli: Neither am I-- not even Catholic. But that guy is also extremely important to the geopolitical stage, and IS the head of a nation.
Alchemist: if you want to see more of a swiss sport, try "Fahnen schwingen"
Kencolt: he was certainly important, and JP II was a sympathethic guy, but now? i'm not so sure anymore
He still is. Maybe not as much upfront-- Benedict does seem to take a less "in your face" role-- but still important.
Did BEN kill Wrek?
Kencolt: dunno... last time i saw him doing anything important, he declared "Tim in Knogo" as a holy book or something...
Kongo*
Okie-dokie-Lokie!
Kencolt: and that book IS slightly racist
Hey everypony! :)
EggNog5000: Hi!
BWWWAAAAAMMMM http://i.imgur.com/KgFwS.jpg

Wrek should of had the NoCD Crack.
Barbetos|AtWork, rofl
You know looking back on the game, Megaman Battle Network 4 is really bad
Dammit
Never played Battle network on GBA. Only Megaman games on GBA i played are the Megaman Zero Series.
Uboa-San: you missed one good game then
After looking at an LP for 4 the quality for it is really bad, typos everywhere, logic failures
battle network 4
*sarcasm.\
Hell the game is glitched so badly at one point
Hey everypony, I'm back
I played ALL The Battle Network games.
And I can hear Wrek typing
And i didnt give a buck about StarForce.
Wait... Tomorrow is the 21st? http://i.imgur.com/pGChc.gif
If you own a Blue moon version and dont own a regular GBA Woodman crashes the game
i only got the pleasure of playing 4 5 and 6 greigar version
The fuck
I liked Starforce
Barbetos|AtWork: let's laugh at the crazy survivalists :D
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I played starforce dragon!
I was more interested in that than Network most of the time
its awsome!
Leo
i only need one more card
and then game completed
Megaman Zero is A Sidescroller. Battle Network is an RPG. Know the Difference.
Last time I played Starforce 2 I cheesed the game
http://i.imgur.com/XKQkK.jpg
Ah hem

The evidence for the mayan doomsday is about as solid as soggy paper
13except they associated calendar rollovers with world shaking changes

:)
Kencolt: Are you in my science lesson? We had a freaking hour debating about the Mayans and their calender
well, some people are going to die tomorrow. trampled to death by the screaming fanatics
Wrek links allowed?
Snow: I'm dying on my 53rd birthday, fortune teller says so
MaxTheBrony: Is he streaming?
Yeah

Snow: my best friend likes to say; "Life is a deadly sickness."
Ooh!!
i dont think we can see it without a telescope
thats tomorrow?
Yes
yes
shit, i'm not prepared D:
it only happends a few thusand million years i think
thelonepony|school: All the reason this end of the world bullshit is because of the lineup
Serenity: ikr
not really
It marks the end of the Mayan callender
Heya thelonepony|school! :)
Its linked with the Mayan calendar
13http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/maya there
A mayan year lasts 5200 years I think, don't quote me
wich will begin a new long-count period on dec 22
Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :3, i've been. Naaaauughty~
How do i shot Web
You know what would be really funny? I think I would die laughing if that happened: The world ends for real tomorrow
the worlds not going to end
13sure it will
shit that would be so funny
thelonepony|school: Okies, detention :3
13you are all in denial
13it is a simple fact of astrophysics that the world will end
Shizuka: oh u
come on guys. we all know the world ends around the year 5'000'000'000... don't you guys watch doctor who?
The world is going to end, just not tommorow
Yeah
*Sarcastic child voice* it endz todai
13it ends tonight
Disregard doomsday, watch ponies
13I KNOW IT DOES, I'VE SEEN IT, THAT'S WHY THE REST OF ME IS JUST GOING TO ENJOY THE SHOW
it totally ends 21.12.2012 - the eastern countries are already dead.
Sure thing bud, just dont forget 2 call yourself really fucking stupid on dec 22.
Shizuka: 3 hours and a half until friday here! :D
aparantly
Eli: Britain isn't dead
Sorry. I had to Refresh the IRC because everything froze.
isnt it exiting? i mean we are all about to die! YAY
i got 10 hours left
Serenity: you have 4.5 more hours
Fun fact
i will dies in 3.5
The mayans e\never included leap years
Eli: I survive everything
So we should have been dead YEARS ago
Im going to have a marathon of pony episodes tonight :D
If the world ends then i'll die watching ponies.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: duh... it is also possible, that the church removed some years in our system
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: you even know why we have them?
Just as the calendar you have on your kitchen wall does not cease to exist after December 31, the Mayan calendar does not cease to exist on December 21, 2012.
Illl watch doctor who to
the world doesnt go around the sun in EXACT a year
So if the mayans did predict a doomsday would have ment we should have died years ago
every 4 years
Evening: my calender ceases to exist after 31.12
the rest of the time that is left is exact 1 day
This will be the worst that happens tomorrow. Carry on. http://i.imgur.com/kHg7w.gif
Evening: every year
im going to hold my fluttershy plushie in my arms and watching ponies b4 the countdown ends, then i can say i died happy
xD
Q: What is the origin of the prediction that the world will end in 2012?
not to mention WE HAVE NO CONCRETE EVEIDENCE THE WORLD WILL END
One thing puzzles me, I heard yellowstone was dorment, isn't it sceduled to erupt soon (I'm speaking like years)
People just fucking assume!
A: The story started with claims that Nibiru, a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians, is headed toward Earth. This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003, but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to December 2012 and linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012 -- hence the predicted doomsday date of December 21, 2012.
Evening: but my stove gets warm and cozy
Wrek: Don't get drunk, that's not the way to go
Right if a planet is heading right for us, why havent we heard about it recently?
I should tell mom that I didn't clean my room. What's the use if the worlds gonna end xD
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CONSPIRACIES :D
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: governement conspiracies
13http://i.imgur.com/wZ92K.jpg WE WILL REBUILD
Hell, if a planet was even near us, the gravitational/tectonic effects would already be eveident-- and it would be VISIBLE.
if mayan was correct we whold be dead years ago
Shizuka: NOOOOOOOOO
We've had SO MANY doomsday theroies and every one of them WAS BULLSHIT
Shizuka: end of the world, but everyone becomes ponies :D
Evening: chill down dude. no one believes the worlds gonna end. we're just havin fun
Wrek is gonna play some tf2 it seems
*theories
ValvE
13no this time the world's really going to end
13you know why?
i saw it through my steam XD
13bieber is still playing music
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: like y2k one, People wasted thousands of dollars (or whatever currency they have) :D
yes becouse all ppl so stupid :3
Shizuka: Actually, you make an extremely valid point
Beiber! i shulda known..
13AND
Shizuka: OMG YOU'RE RIGHT D8
Old joke is ol
One direction don't help either
13so is nickleback
So?
Wrek: is there any weapon you want in tf2?
OOOOOH I should look in my bowl of soup and predict the realy future!
Skaeyp
13but the worst part is
13THEY WILL SUDDENLY BE GOOD
real*
13RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
D:
Shizuka: Riiiiight
oh we're playing TF2?
My soup told me it will be gone in several minutes.
oh dos dat loud beep
13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the mayans predicted awful 21st century pop artists!
god"
HAHAHAHAAA :D
Shizuka: So when they were saying "End of the world" They meant "End of the world for music"
Who the heck is that?
13yes
Maybe Twilight will be good for once
Well shit.
Ah the guy streaming is swedish! :D
13and actually
Hi swedish bro :)
13since i just finished setting up hikari
Evening: Didn't you know?
13it will be the end of my minecraft world
nope i dident know he was swedish
Shizuka: Ran out of RAM?
13nah restarting
I'll be here laughing my ass off at the idiots
end of the world tomrrow
Slenderman will kill us
13hopefully i can convince minecraft to live under 1GB on hikari
It will be the end of the world as we know it
on channel 9
I can max Shitcraft with 2 gig of RAM
13wreeeeeeek <3
Shizuka: :3
go get them
13Serenity: see i tell it to use 1GB on asuka, but it manages to gleefully eat up 4GB
OHHAIMARK: http://i.imgur.com/CdIAl.gif
But I upgraded to 12 gig, so I can put it on ultimate PC raping
13hopefully on a dedicated server box it will learn to live within its means
i got a weapons too much, you want any Wrek? it would be a waste if i had to scrap them.
Shizuka: Do you have a Server Computer?
I'd imagine you have, since you do a tonne of hosting
13just set up hikari yesterday, 4GB ram where it matters
13better than haruko rocking 256MB
4 gig? Hmm, I'd expect something like 32 gig for a cheapo
13$15
I know super super expensive servers tend to have like 128-256 gig
13yeah i have no money at all
^
13sorry 2GB ram, it can handle up to 4
Saving up money, gonna buy a Falcon Laptop
13but buying the ram to max it out would cost $70 so no go
13squeeze as much as i can get out of 2GB scavenged from other boxen
woah that shizuka pink is all over :D
While I remember about internet connection and such, anyone ever had BT all around? The deal that lets you connect anywhere with 3G?
my mum's been thinking of buying BT with 3G connection support
Serenity: BT?
Yes, BT

(I wont put a link to the vid, but I believe images are okay. unless that changed while I was away, if so, speak now!)
Herostar: nope, that's still the rule
Nah, the rules are still the same
allright, so images okay. now how to screenshot... ^////^
I can set up complex redstone in minecraft, and make a banner to fit it, but I can't do a screenshot...
lol

so what movies are on tonight
yessir
Ohai cachi01 :)
Apperently Megaman Battle Network 4 essentally killed the franchise, shame. I sort of liked it
it was meh
05live techno done right
05too abd the vid doesnt feaute the actual live play
05but beats bring ing an macbook
i always thought that Star Force killed it SpadeKyurem[WoW]
05thats it for me for today
Starforce was good,imo
05gona make warcraft 2 work now
05scoot will take over
05this vid ends in less than a minute
05enjoy :D
then as normal for our species we seem to disagree on the killer
Also you if you get the Woodman Scenario in Blue Moon you can't finish the game
Guess why
For some god damn reason the game cant be coded properly on anything besides a regular GBA
umm i never had a problem with the woodman scenerio
and i played the game about 3 times
On what system?
GBA
The game has some kind of loading error exiting a random battle when on a SP or DS
i have both
and played it on both
never seen it
i'll just leave this here........ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pSmhZFbCy0
must have had a good copy then
The most game breaking bug in 4 is if you link the Blue moon and red sun before fighting the 6 version navis the game becomes unplayable
well i remember that one but glitches doesn't kill a franchise
just the game itself
Well the fact the quality to 4 was crap
Starforce was crap in both story and quality compared to the previous games
Not to me
It played better than Network
At least Starforce didnt have bullshit minigame tedium just to get through the game
.................................
HI
We're live!
Personally I dont see how Starforce was worse than Battle Network, Network had SO MUCH BACKTRACKING
wait i thought this was MLG
:O
who is this streaming?
PERRYDOTTO <3
brb eating
what is dis?
:D
thing is though without the backtracking gameplay became so linear and the battle system for SF had little to know strategy
Back tracking is not how you lengthen a game
omg..
It gets boring, fast
i could join that game
but i need to look the pass up :\
:D
Ok, who's the clown constantly extending the time?
