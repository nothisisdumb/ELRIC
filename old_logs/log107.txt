*Vandarium detecs picture spam
<Vandarium> detects*
<Vandarium> derp
<ThunderDash> DecapPony; there's that scene near the start of WWU where she's in four places at once too :P
<Reaver21> Decap, bon Bon knows that very same wizardry :D
<DuspenDe> Let me guess, Greg.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol Decap
<DuspenDe> You force your patient into Cardiac Arrest
<Reaver21> And same with Colgate..
<DuspenDe> To prove your point to cuddy.
<DuspenDe> Then she calls you an asshole and gives you the permission for the MRI
<DuspenDe> Which comes up clean.
<DecapPony> i shall find these pictures of the other magic pwnies.....
<ThunderDash> I think one of the talents all background ponies have is to be in multiple places at once
<DecapPony> but first
<DuspenDe> Then you get a bone marrow biopsy and she has cancer.
<DecapPony> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-aww-thanks-fluttershy.jpg
<Vandarium> *SHE HATES YOU, DEAL WITH IT.*
<DuspenDe> Then you pump her full off chemo
<Reaver21> MY GUESS: They both die, and are buried next to each other. Or they live, which is mundane.
<DuspenDe> And watch her die, in which you talk to Wilson and have a "House moment" in which you give her steroids against a bacterial infection
<NightShade> was that WoW on that screen just then? XD
<Vandarium> Mushroomz
<Sumica> hosed up every hole

<DuspenDe> Oh in which case I will have you know, in the end of season 7, House rams his car into Cuddy's house and through her living room.
<Reaver21> Wow.
<Reaver21> Who is Cuddy, again?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd be angry DuspenDe, if that hadn't already been spoiled to me by my roommate
<DuspenDe> Then he is happy and goes on vacation.
<DuspenDe> The boss.
<DuspenDe> Cuddy is the hot Dean of Medicine.
<Reaver21> Oh yes. I see.
<DuspenDe> inb4 flatline.
<WhatPayne> You can't spoil it to me, but someone else might not like spoilers.
<Vandarium> _________________________
<Dermathil> >mfw DuspenDe just spoiled it to me. WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would say it's best to stay away from spoilers :P
<herospirit> *GotSpoilered*
<DuspenDe> Oh really? Did you watch the episode(s) where house is at a psychiatric hospital?

<Dermathil> I'm worried about everything you say DuspenDe. Because it makes me think each times you're an inch away from spoiling the episode's solution
<Daz> Vandarium: took a lot of courage to buy them, but i didn't use any autocheck, and two dads gave me faces of disapproval. In Spain, those kinda faces are very, very scary. but yes Brushables are so awesome

<madponyking> lol: VHS. Prooves how old this episode really is...
<DuspenDe> You all suck.
<Daz> why can't I hold all this trollphilosophy

<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/gi746i
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I had a roommate like that...really drove me fucking crazy
<DuspenDe> His muscles were dying. Dying muscle tissue releases a toxin. If it reaches the heart = Dead
<Vandarium> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/18/
<Daz> lawl, DecapPony , are you a spy
<DuspenDe> He decided instead of amputation to just remove his dead lump of his leg.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he could read people like crazy, and then he'd say God told him
<DuspenDe> Forever pain.
<madponyking> I seeee...
<Daz> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/18.jpg
<Reaver21> WE GOT A SPY IN HERE!

<Vandarium> http://miburl.com/BcqRkr
<Daz> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/18.jpg
<Daz> see, Vandarium ? ^_^
<DuspenDe> He's faking.
<WhatPayne> Like I said I love this episode because House is so awesome in this
<Vandarium> Daz, it didn't work. It opened a new picture
<DuspenDe> He wants to pretend god cures him.
<DuspenDe> House then does an MRI or CT scan
<DuspenDe> Finds out something is actually wrong.
<Daz> Vandarium: right click, and from the new options 'open image in new tab,' NOT left click :P
<DuspenDe> Then is all self satisfied as he tells his faker he is not a faker afterall.
<Daz> try it Vandarium
<herospirit> My sister had a classmate who tried to hold an exorcism on another classmate for being clumsy. :0
<Ziltoid> this is go be good
<Daz> ah sorry yea, Vandarium i meant 'open IMAGE in new tab,' not 'open link in new tab'

<Daz> ValtheJean: ikr, but 500ml af ew times an hour? that's like 2 L per hour. 4 hours later, 8 L? :O
<Daz> i guess when you're ill, you drink more and urinate more thou
<Sumica> this guy is't house why is the cammer still on him?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I refill my water bottles pretty regularly

<Daz> Bob parr?

<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, I quit soft drinks about 2 months ago
<DuspenDe> I bet you it will reveal tuberous Sclerosis.
<madponyking> Let me guess. Shes cured of her cancer?
*Vandarium is going to go play something I guess
<DuspenDe> Oh look
<DuspenDe> I was right.
<DuspenDe> Yes
<DuspenDe> Thank you.
<Reaver21> I'm a horrible person, using Rarity as a replacement wheel for a car :/
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Umad?

<Sumica> It's hardly a leap of logic there DuspenDe
<DuspenDe> Foreman and Cameron, go give him an MRI.
<WhatPayne> Just be careful so that your um salt levels do not drop too much
<Daz> salty levels :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I want Dr. House to HEEEYULLLLL me
<DuspenDe> If I'm right.

<DuspenDe> Or a blowjob.
*Applejack revived

<Pinkie_Pie> 13Cutie mark is a lotus flower
<Sumica> still too early
<Pinkie_Pie> 13He said about Dr Whoof in size
<DuspenDe> It's Herpes.
<DuspenDe> Check his urine, you'll see I'm right.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not sure if trolling, or breaking spoilers...
<Denied_Existence> Oh...well he DOES have a female persona...
<madponyking> erhem... fictional charecter
<Denied_Existence> I may need to rethink the gender based equations....
<DuspenDe> I am not breaking spoilers.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Erm
<DuspenDe> I am using deductive reasoning
<DuspenDe> To find out what is wrong.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13He said as a mail, she has the same tail
<DuspenDe> It is Herpes.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13But a shorter mane with a bit more fluff
<MeteorVenture> it was just a picture of disappointed fluttershy
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/Yh0TNS
<madponyking> herpes makes tumors now?
<DuspenDe> Herpes Encephalitis.
<ThunderDash> i know just about nothing about medicine, so :P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You dont think you could convert her to male?
<DecapPony> http://miburl.com/jqmWcr
<DuspenDe> No.
<madponyking> Im serious. how dose herpes work?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Decap
<DuspenDe> But the Herpes is fighting the tumors.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Y u no find bigger pictures
<DuspenDe> Which is causing all the cramps.
<DuspenDe> His body is more or less
<DuspenDe> Fighting itself.
<DecapPony> i can just link the pics from the Poniborru page
<DuspenDe> Give him some Anti-Biotics and move on to next patient.
<Denied_Existence> I could...but it just doesn't seem right for some reason...(But still do-able) Y'all decide
<madponyking> can I ask how old you are?
<DuspenDe> 16.
<madponyking> out of curiosity
<madponyking> aaah...
<Applejack> =P
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Doesnt seem right because of Wrek?
<DuspenDe> God is a joke.
<DuspenDe> Can we move on now.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Or because of the way she looks
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It is a little bit hard to imagine her as a guy
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<DuspenDe> I call AppleJack Redneck pony.
<DecapPony> just make me the pony of death
<Denied_Existence> Yeah, well you do have to consider that the lotus would look weird on a guy

<Daz> myfacewhen he's playing that in real life. : D
<DecapPony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/51701

<Pinkie_Pie> 13It looks kinda like a ninja star
<Daz> sure does!
<Pinkie_Pie> 13I dont think it would look that weird
<Denied_Existence> Plus I would have to rethink the name
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Besides, you only have to describe it, not draw a picture
<madponyking> LOL
<madponyking> I called it
<Denied_Existence> 3I have to draw a picture
<Denied_Existence> 3With words
<DuspenDe> Hmm
<DuspenDe> The god kid
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Hmm
<DuspenDe> Passed Herpes to Wilsons patient.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Well, I dont think it would do as much to Val if we didnt find a male.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<DuspenDe> Would explain the shrinkage of tumors
<DecapPony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/51701

<ValtheJean> 2,14 >16....>medical knowledge.....>troll
<Pinkie_Pie> 13What pony of death?
<DuspenDe> Now watch me be right.
<madponyking> or you have watched the ep before
<DecapPony> the pony of death
<DuspenDe> And realise I have actual knowledge.
<DecapPony> like the grim reaper
<DuspenDe> Nope.
<DuspenDe> Never Season 2.
<DuspenDe> Season 1, 5, 6 and 7.
<DecapPony> that sends the spirits of dead ponies onto the afterlife
<DecapPony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/51693
<Daz> season 3's interesting, DuspenDe
<Pinkie_Pie> 13There is a pony of death in our trollfic..?
<Dermathil> >mfw we never mentioned it was Season 2
<prince-dari> Series Daz, series.
<prince-dari> LO
<prince-dari> :P*
<DuspenDe> Season 6 and 7 is still my favourite.
<DecapPony> we can make caramel die
<Daz> ack! sorry dari
<AllisZero> Hey, Dari, Luna
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, Dermathil's got you there :P
<Denied_Existence> 3Thats horrid
<herospirit> The... royal list? :0
<AllisZero> Did you guys want me to stress test the shit out of the stream?
<Denied_Existence> 3JUST GET THE LIST FOOL
<Daz> keep forgetting that I actually prefer to say series. I tend to use 'season' for american shows and 'series' for uk shows
<DuspenDe> No
<herospirit> FFFFFFF-
<DuspenDe> We're busy seeing if I'm right.
<DecapPony> is that not what we want?
<Denied_Existence> 3JK
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Daz> wikipedia's a wonderful tool
<AllisZero> I just learned I have a 100mbit up/down connection probably till tomorrow evening
<DuspenDe> Wikipedia is for people without actual knowledge.
<AllisZero> (it'll be throttled down to 10/10 on Thursday)
<herospirit> No, not kill Caramel.
<DecapPony> fine
<herospirit> Just emotionally crush
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Herospirit, we are talking about ValxWrek for now
<Daz> ;__; why's that AllisZero ?
<AllisZero> I could probably make a script to open 50-60 tabs of the stream to see how things handle it.
<AllisZero> DCD wanted to but he's unavailable
<Pinkie_Pie> 13You could come up with an entirely new name
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Something similar to Wrek
<DecapPony> i was talking abou tthat fic
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Like you did with Valerie Jean
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Lol
<AllisZero> That's because it's still not ready for production, Daz, so the rules and policies aren't all set up yet
<Apokalipse> Hello bronystate!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello apokalipse
<Daz> aww that sucks...when will it be set up, then, AllisZero ?
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Also, I noticed a slight error
<Pinkie_Pie> 13It still says "Waitress"
<Daz> ohai Apokalipse !
<ThunderDash> hi apokalipse
<DuspenDe> call
<DuspenDe> LOLOOLO
<Denied_Existence> 3Fine Hero...you've got your mind wrapped around people dying, I WILL FIGURE THE NAME OUT.
<Apokalipse> Hey Val, Daz, Thunder. I'm here for my House
<AllisZero> Actually if I connect a GBic connector with fiber to the one switch I have that supports it, I could probably have a 1Gbit/s connection :p
<Apokalipse> Let me guess though
<Daz> ikr Apokalipse ; )
<Denied_Existence> 3Oh, well i'd better fix that
<Apokalipse> It's not lupus
<DecapPony> your welcome for that hero
<DecapPony> trollface.jpg
<DuspenDe> Ofcourse it's not Lupus.
<Apokalipse> Okay, I'm in the loop then lol
<Daz> "...eventually"
<DuspenDe> There are NO symptoms that even point slightly towards lupus.
<AllisZero> Going home bronies, see yall in a bit
<DuspenDe> My bet is Herpes Encaphilitis.
<Pinkie_Pie> 13Eh, sorry Denied. Just trying to throw ideas out there
<herospirit> Wat; wat happen
<herospirit> I was watching house. :0
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see ya allis
<DuspenDe> bb
<herospirit> Wrek is pretty manly...
<ThunderDash> bye allis
<madponyking> bah bah
<Daz> Aww man, house is so low, yet his smile, and his genius in deducing that is so awesome. HOUSE Y U SO COMPLEX >_<
<herospirit> How can the name get manlier? WREK?
<DuspenDe> He is not complex.
<DuspenDe> He is actually so simple
<MeteorVenture> someone set up us the bomb
<herospirit> Maybe if it was Wrok.
<Denied_Existence> 3I could make his name "Reckless"
<herospirit> :0
<Daz> orlynao
<Daz> explain DuspenDe
<DecapPony> that would do
<DuspenDe> And predictable.
<herospirit> sounds good
<Daz> predictable, yes
<DuspenDe> Elaborate on how he is complex.
<Daz> i didn't mean from just here, in other scenes too :P
<DecapPony> what does my pwnies name get to be?
<Daz> good vid, DuspenDe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fRvqR2tPzk
<Daz> :P
<DuspenDe> House needs to get back on Methadone.
<Denied_Existence> 3I haven't read yours yet, will check real quick
<Daz> heh
<DecapPony> my suggestion, Decapitation Maker
<DecapPony> it will make sense when you see what i sent
<herospirit> "pwnies name"?
<DecapPony> did i miss the IT crowd?
<Denied_Existence> 3That sounds....horrible...
<DecapPony> cause ponies pwn
<DecapPony> and im a horrible person
<herospirit> Oh, I see XD
<Apokalipse> Hi DP, I don't know, I just joined
<Daz> yea DecapPony
<DecapPony> exactly
<Daz> we had pokémon, we had IT crowd, now we have House M.D.
<Daz> ;)
<DecapPony> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Applejack> gee, calm down
<DecapPony> BUT I MISSED POKEMON!
<Daz> oof low blow son
<Daz> low blow
<Denied_Existence> 3...
<Applejack> =o
<DuspenDe> God is le fag
*Denied_Existence 3wonders why only his pony ever has flaws....
<Dermathil> God is a killer tomato
<madponyking> god is a purple octapus
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's not how you spell flying spaghetti monster
<Apokalipse> I must admit. God is probably a killer tomato...
<DuspenDe> And there it is.
<DecapPony> i just made mine sound like my self
<Pinkie_Pie> Did I miss anything? Internet derped
<Apokalipse> and suddenly idea
<DuspenDe> Let me hear it.
<DuspenDe> Herpes.
<Denied_Existence> 3 0_o
<DuspenDe> Herpes go house
<DuspenDe> YES
<DuspenDe> OOOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH
<DuspenDe> FEELS GOOD MAN
<Daz> dude, wikipedia
<FreezeFrame> God is female
<Dermathil> you didn't understand the joke, madponyking, right? You weren't around when we watched Attack of the killer tomatoes I guess?
<DuspenDe> Wikipedia is for people without actual knowledge.
<Reaver21> Blues Brothers reference!!
<Reaver21> YESS.
<DuspenDe> YES
<DuspenDe> OH GOD
<madponyking> nope I wasnt... :,{
<DuspenDe> FUCK YES...
*WhatPayne gives Luna socks
<DuspenDe> I knew it.
<Daz> haha, but DuspenDe i'm on about 'house episodes' wikipedia, where it explains the final problem
<DuspenDe> Oh god...
<Daz> Put them on Dr-Luna
<Dermathil> also, thanks for the early spoil, DuspenDe. Really fun... [/sarcasm]
<herospirit> RAAAPE
<DuspenDe> Well that's cheating.
<Reaver21> although, it's not as good as the Pulpfiction one..
<DuspenDe> It's not really spoiling, because you don't know if it's true yet.
<DecapPony> fuck ive been up for 2 hours and im tired
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what he's saying DuspenDe, is that it is incredibly easy to look up the spoilers
<DuspenDe> Let's watch him prove herpes.
<DuspenDe> Yes.
<DuspenDe> But I did not, lol.
<DuspenDe> LOL
<DuspenDe> Dad to Son: Son, take off your clothes!
<Dermathil> Give us proof of it, DuspenDe.
<DuspenDe> Anti-Biotics.
<Daz> then, DuspenDe, i tip my hat to you, sir :P
<DuspenDe> Prove it I did.
<DuspenDe> I did*
<Dermathil> where is the proof that you didn't look the spoilers up?
<DuspenDe> I don't have to prove anything to anybody, becaues I know what I'm saying is true.
<DuspenDe> If you prefer to believe I cheated, then whatever floats your boat.
<Dermathil> But WE don't. Try to convince us.
<ValtheJean> 2,14Oh god...okay. Regardless of what anyone thinks, we're dropping the subject. NOW
<DuspenDe> Just because you have no ACTUAL medical knowledge and have to look up diagnosis and cross reference, it doesn't mean everyone has to.
<DuspenDe> I'm gonna go to bed.
<DuspenDe> Later.
<Daz> i prefer to believe you got it, DuspenDe, and congratulations!
<prince-dari> Night.
<Reaver21> Later.
<ThunderDash> night
<madponyking> buh-byee
<Reaver21> This song :/
<madponyking> yaaay.
<Dermathil> What we watching now?
<Reaver21> eeyup.
<madponyking> now what?
<Daz> yay, thanks for streaming that Dr-Luna
<Reaver21> Scrubs?
<madponyking> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Reaver21> YAY!
<Dermathil> eeeegh
<Apokalipse> Wait, waht is this?
<Reaver21> This is good!
<Daz> hmm, haven't ever seen this :P i only hear good things 'bout it
<prince-dari> Meh, not a scrubs fan.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >mfw I've never seen scrubs
<Apokalipse> oh
<Dermathil> the show DOESN'T start well.
<Apokalipse> I've never seen scrubs either
<WhatPayne> Never watched Scrubs ever
<Reaver21> It's the first episode, though. I've never seen this episode~
<prince-dari> It's one of those things where most people like it.
<prince-dari> Like Friends. >_>
<prince-dari> MFW I dislike both
<prince-dari> XD
<Apokalipse> But then Hipsters are all like: Too mainstream
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I enjoyed Friends when I was younger, but looking back on it...meh...'
<Dermathil> dari, I don't think I'm gonna be part of the "like" group. Why? Because the main character looks like an idiot in the first 60 seconds of the episode. Aka, HORRIBLE first impression.
<herospirit> Scubs is usually pretty dang funny
<Apokalipse> The theme song annoyed me when I was younger
<herospirit> Though I can see where you wouldn't like it.
<DecapPony> HAI SCRUBS!
<Dermathil> my god this show feels One-dimensional and braindead ALREADY. ABANDON THREAD
<herospirit> I:[
<prince-dari> Meh, everyone likes different stuff.
<Applejack> okaaaay...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm just waiting until I see the clip that is in Ponies Anthology :P
<ThunderDash> yeah, not gonna lie, I don't really like it either
<herospirit> Except for I.T. crowd
<herospirit> Everyone likes I.T. crowd
<Reaver21> LOL
<Applejack> ...
<Dr-Luna> 07at this speed... we're soon running out of IT Crowd :(
<herospirit> :[
<DecapPony> NOOOOOO
<ThunderDash> D:
<DecapPony> :(
<Dr-Luna> 07Taking idea's though for a replacement
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there are plenty of other shows out there :P
<WhatPayne> I have good IT Crowd replacement in mind
<Daz> did i hear ... doctor dorian?
<Dermathil> I feel like I want to curl up in the corner and cry the hell out of myself. Because I feel I'm already out of brain bleach.
<Dr-Luna> 07do tell?
<Reaver21> ARGH these ponies are so hard to pose!
<WhatPayne> Spaced
<herospirit> :D
<Daz> Reaver21, pose?
<herospirit> I agree with Payne.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, I'm always fond of Black Books <.< >..
<Reaver21> I.T. Crowd?
<Reaver21> And, Daz, yes.
<WhatPayne> thx
<herospirit> I've only seen a couple episodes of Spaced, but they were good
<herospirit> very good
<WhatPayne> The show was brilliant, which is why it's sad it ended with so few seasons
<herospirit> Simon Pegg is Baws
<WhatPayne> It's Simon Pegg at his best
<DecapPony> soooooo
<madponyking> Doc Cox rulez
<Pinkie_Pie> Erm
<Pinkie_Pie> So what are we gonna do?
<herospirit> Dat talking
<herospirit> YESH, the janitor
<DecapKing> why is it so quiet here?
<Pinkie_Pie> Well
<Pinkie_Pie> We are all deep in thought
<Pinkie_Pie> I guess
<Pinkie_Pie> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hmm....is the stream lagging for anyone else?
<DecapKing> im not
<Daz> not for me
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Reaver21> I'm just going to go now~ Yall don't get too lonely without me now.
<madponyking> nah
<WhatPayne> It was before, but not for a while
<Pinkie_Pie> Well start thinkin
<ValtheJean> 2,14 curses.....and gnight reaver
<madponyking> okz bye...

<Daz> HAhaha
<ThunderDash> Hi
<Daz> ohai Turtaguin
<madponyking> yo
<Denied_Existence> 3Eh.
*Dermathil is feeling like he should cry because of the inherent stupidity of the main characters, yet he feels that the show is so bad it doesn't even deserve a single tear to be shed
<Daz> oh wow, that doctor's so cool
<Denied_Existence> Woah, damn connection
<herospirit> Cox is the best.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ohai denied
<ThunderDash> hi Denied
<Denied_Existence> Hey Val. I finally begun reading this thing on mspaintadventures...
<Denied_Existence> And holy shit its long
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah? what about it?
<herospirit> DENIED. YESH
<madponyking> oh heeeeeeel no!
<Daz> aw heeel naw
<herospirit> What thing you reading, Denied?
<Dermathil> >mfw they are probably all so unprofessional they should all be fired for their lack of professionalism...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >implying house is professional :P
<Apokalipse> House is boss
<Dermathil> >implying the rest of House's crew ISN'T
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, they go along with it!
<Apokalipse> Because House is boss
<Apokalipse> And he's more competent than the rest
<Apokalipse> he always knows it's not lupus
<Pinkie_Pie> Decap, this is what I have to say to that
<Pinkie_Pie> http://s2.postimage.org/n2ybbh3du/Capture.png
<Dermathil> Valthejean, this is why: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndLifeSaving
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/OlQKUc
<Pinkie_Pie> If you need link
<herospirit> Bromance
<FreezeFrame> House gets away with shit because he's awesome at saving people's lives.
<Dermathil> FreezeFrame knows well.

<Pinkie_Pie> My name on google doc is Danielvickers?
<Pinkie_Pie> http://miburl.com/JRpyv3
<Apokalipse> Also, he is boss
<Apokalipse> Did I say that yet?
<Dermathil> I don't think so
<Ziltoid> dat pacman
<DecapKing> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48268?search=spike
<madponyking> It´s Cox! hes the good guy!!
<Applejack> yaaay mr Cox!!!
<FreezeFrame> Similar to Dr. Perry Cox (though it makes more sense in the comedy setting of Scrubs)
*Dermathil feels this fails even as a comedy
<FreezeFrame> Sure he's a sarcastic ass that treats his interns like crap, but dammit if he isn't a good doctor, and the interns he trains make great doctors.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 que the "im awesome" song
<Apokalipse> yeah, it's not as good as the other stuff we watch
<Ziltoid> oh hey
<Apokalipse> Hi Škoda!
<Daz> "I'm awesome"
<Daz> :3

<SilverMane> as much as I dislike this song, the pmv makes it awesome
<herospirit> fuck, broken link
<Dermathil> ohai Silvermane

<Applejack> okaaay...
*SilverMane is awesome
<SilverMane> @sexymeter Silvermane
<SilverMane> awww
*Applejack is awesome as well
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no steven for you :P
<SilverMane> Steven_Magnet gone?
<Dermathil> I think I'm traumatized by the inherent boring comedy/stupidity that Scrubs is filled to the brim with.
<Applejack> eeyup
*Octavia 14is so very awesome too /sarcasism
<SilverMane> did Dermathil just dis Scrubs?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but Octavia IS awesome :P
<Dermathil> yes I did, Silvermane.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 crack out dat cello
<herospirit> Dermathil hates the FUCK out of scrubs
<SilverMane> Maestro, if you would cue the 'It. Is. On.' Rarity sound
<Octavia> 14lol <3
<herospirit> Dari silently dislikes it
<madponyking> true
<Dermathil> Because it made me cry for gallons of Brain Bleach.
<Apokalipse> Škoda, you are awesome no need for sarcasism
<Applejack> xD
<herospirit> and someone else hates it slightly less than Derm, but I forget who
<herospirit> Just so you're caught up, silver :P
<Pinkie_Pie> Brb
<Octavia> 14I wish the Skoda Octavia was allowed in the US, sucks lol
<herospirit> A'ight
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when in doubt, just guess me as apparently I hate everything :P
<Applejack> No u don't
<Applejack> example: You love tridents
<madponyking> samurai applejack!
<herospirit> Alright, Val hates it slightly less than Derm, if I had to guess :p
<Octavia> 14lol
<madponyking> play it play it!
<ValtheJean> :P
<SilverMane> WAT
<Applejack> sure
<herospirit> WAT
<Pinkie_Pie> WAT?!
*SilverMane loves him some Scrubs
<Pinkie_Pie> WAT YOU MEAN WAT
*Applejack hugs madponyking
<Dermathil> I'm feeling that Scrubs is the Matt Smith of the Medical shows. Maybe because it is a sitcom whose jokes aren't even funny for trying too hard (and just results in looking dumb)
<SilverMane> I approve of this nonsense
*madponyking is hugged and accepts the bro-love
<DecapKing> how was that whiskey i gave you?
<Dermathil> (yeah, I said Matt Smith.)
<Denied_Existence> Ich bin heir
*Octavia 14is not a fan of Scrubs
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >mfw I can't remember who that is
*Octavia 14hides
*Pinkie_Pie goes to google translate
<Apokalipse> no need to hide
<Applejack> who who?
<Apokalipse> I dislike Scrubs too
<SilverMane> Dermathil, most of the jokes are based on older episodes, development of character relationships, and it was a sitcom that just happened to be about doctors
<DecapKing> he said i am here
*Applejack is searching for Octavia
<herospirit> I accidentally the internet!
<SilverMane> I had whiskey?
<herospirit> where was I....
<herospirit> Oh yes,
<madponyking> Y U ALL HATE ON SCRUBS?!
<herospirit> WAT!?!
<DecapKing> yep
<Dark_Heart> play something else besides scrubs
<FreezeFrame> You really do have to watch the whole series to get Scrubs
<Octavia> 14XD
<Applejack> Play some pony vids =3
<Dermathil> Silvermane, the first sixty seconds of the show made the main character look like an idiot! (the bad kind of idiot)
<madponyking> yeah!
<herospirit> http://i.neoseeker.com/mgv/574321-Liege/321/105/11098_spiderman_crossover_fluttershy_macro_spider_man_spiderman_spiderman_is_a_pony_display.jpg
<DecapKing> WAT
<SilverMane> the Bro-marriage of JD and Turk is worth it alone
<herospirit> and then I did that.
<Applejack> like Pony Champloo or Ponies Anthology
<SilverMane> and JD IS the bad kind of idiot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 sathi trolls with G3 again :P
<herospirit> WAT
<Octavia> 14I get the humor and such, but I just don't like doctors and hospitals much.
<Apokalipse> Don't do tjat, trolling is bad
<DecapKing> YOUR PIC DUN DERPED
<SilverMane> Pony Champloo is REAL!?!? WOOT
<Apokalipse> that*
<herospirit> WAT?
<Dermathil> The show ruined, trampled, set on fire and peed on its first impression.
<herospirit> http://i.neoseeker.com/mgv/574321-Liege/321/105/11098_spiderman_crossover_fluttershy_macro_spider_man_spiderman_spiderman_is_a_pony_display.jpg.

<Denied_Existence> Hey...how long is this mspaintadventure thing...?
<Denied_Existence> It seems hellishly long...
<Dermathil> just wait.
<Dermathil> This thing is awesome.
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: Homestuck rigt?
<Thunder_Dash> oh shi-
<Dermathil> >yfw the man ASKED for it
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: *right. and yes, long webcomic is looooong.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, he asked for it by trying to save people's lives
<Denied_Existence> IDK GGgala
<Kencolt706> Except they weren't going to hurt anyone...
<Denied_Existence> So far up to the "Medium of gears and fire"
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and made no notice saying so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they just walked up and started harassing people
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's VERY easy to get the wrong impression
<Denied_Existence> Please tell me I am like halfway or something...
<Kencolt706> They are, as the Doctor said, think.
<Kencolt706> Thick.
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: it's just that there's multiple stories on mspaintadventures.com. Problem Sleuth is pretty manageable.
<Thunder_Dash> only one I've finished is Problem Sleuth, loved it
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: if it involves "the Medium," it sounds like Homestuck. i'm still on Act 4.
<Denied_Existence> Its the REALLY long one...
<Dermathil> Valthejean, he asked for it by attacking someone who wasn't aggressive. They didn't hurt anyone, they were just putting them through a triage
<Denied_Existence> Or at least I am guessing its the long one...
<Nittany_Tiger> 
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: the one with John Egbert lover of terrible movies, right?
<Denied_Existence> >MFIf longer ones exist...
<Kencolt706> Ohhh.kaaaaay.
<Denied_Existence> Yeah
<Kencolt706> A radiation fart?
<Dermathil> BAREFOOTED ON THE MOOON
<Silvermane> lol
<Dermathil> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE SCREWDRIVER
<GGgala_> >Stoker
<GGgala_> >drinking blood
<GGgala_> oh u.
<The_Si_BadGui> sXe
<Kencolt706> Oh, she'sGOOD.
<Denied_Existence> LOL, Davesprite...thats a good idea.
<Kencolt706> NOW she believes.
<Denied_Existence> Or...wait... GGgala_ am I ahead of or behind you?
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: probably ahead. what Act are you on?
<DecapKing> what are you guys talking about?
<Denied_Existence> I have no clue anymore
<Denied_Existence> Where I am, John, Rose, and Dave are all in the medium now...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mfw some god damn salesman just walked into my apartment
<herospirit> HOMESTUCK.
<herospirit> Son, I am proud.
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: waaaay ahead of me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well I just missed the what...10 minutes of what happened
<Kencolt706> The doctor os suddenly very kissy these days.
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: Rose JUST entered for me.
<Denied_Existence> And DecapKing, go to mspaintadventures.com
<herospirit> Read it. Do it.
<Denied_Existence> Well I'd better not spoiler
<herospirit> Homestuck/Ponies covers about 80% of my free time.
<herospirit> I don't suppose you read Problem Slueth as well?
<GGgala_> Problem Sleuth, btw: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4 . it's nonstop lulzy.
<Silvermane> my niece and nephew run into the computer room and set some swords behind my back to hold. weird
<herospirit> That's... what, Silvermane?
<herospirit> :0
<DecapKing> i can see where they get their weird behavior from
<Nittany_Tiger> My free time will be eaten up by school work.
<Ziltoid> dat straw
<Kencolt706> And she just screwed up.
<Silvermane> lol
<prince-dari> Dat MW2 nuke noise?
<Nittany_Tiger> Sadly.
<GGgala_> Silvermane: wait... they want you to hold their swords?
<Silvermane> they put them behind my neck, between me and the chair
<herospirit> The Homestuck fandom is second best fandom. Number one is obvious. Number one and number two cross over quite often; like someone just posted THIS on the MSPA forums. http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3455/derpyh.png
<Ziltoid> fuck you guys im going home
<ValtheJean> 2,14 gnight ziltoid

<AllisZero> That wasn't even a real CPR
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm completely lost as now twice some assholes decided to walk into my apartment and bother me
<herospirit> Makes sense to me Silvermane.
<Silvermane> real CPR causes damage if done righ
<Silvermane> right
<NekoGamer> What show is this ?
<Kencolt706> Doctor Who.
<Dermathil> The Space Police found their alien
<Ziltoid> dr.who
<Dermathil> They killed it
<E_N> >what show is this
<GGgala_> ValtheJean: don't most apartments have a locking door?
<E_N> >mfw
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they do, but my asshole roommates keep leaving it unlocked
<Silvermane> lawl wut
<GGgala_> it's raining on the moon! hallelujah
<Thunder_Dash> suddenly hospital out of nowhere
<DecapKing> Molestia, thats what
<Silvermane> I'm free of her
<Silvermane> free...
<DecapKing> as am i
<Silvermane> OH GOD I'M FREE
<E_N> His story
<Silvermane> NO NO NO
<herospirit> Silvermane, did you make the foam swords yourself? :0
<Silvermane> nah, stepdad did years ago for me to practice with
<Silvermane> although i did make one for real Larping
<DecapKing> i used wooden swords to practice with
<prince-dari> SAXON
<Denied_Existence> Also, I will say this Homestuck has some awesome fucking music
<DecapKing> but now i have real swords
<Dermathil> SAXON
<Silvermane> practice with hitting each other in the head and arm?
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<ValtheJean> 2,14 seriously, what is with Saxon? Am I supposed to be paying attention to that
<herospirit> Denied_Exisence: Damn straight :0
<herospirit> Existence*

<prince-dari> No, the name Saxon.
<Dermathil> Mr Saxon
<prince-dari> :P
<Denied_Existence> OH THANK GOD, THEY DO A RECAP EVENTUALLY
<NekoGamer> If there was a man watching me like this in a back alley, I wouldn't go there
<GGgala_> Denied_Existence: ikr? dat epic act-closing sequence
<herospirit> Also, tell Pinkie_Pie to read Homestuck sometime, Denied_Existence :P
<DecapKing> the dude that plays the doctor?
<MeteorVenture> homestuck fans being second best fandom? idk.. i think the touhou fans might have something to say about that
<Dermathil> they NEVER do Recaps, Denied_Existence.
<Silvermane> SAXON
<E_N> I'd go if he promised candy
<Denied_Existence> YES THEY DO...I AM READING IT RIGHT NOW
<Dermathil> Silvermane, you are way behind
<Denied_Existence> But I aint spoiling it

<herospirit> So far I've seen Pony fans to be the kind of people who like Homestuck. :0
<Kencolt706> Dimensional Trancendance. Gotta love it.
<Silvermane> so far I've seen Pony fans to like ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, EXCEPT WHEN THEY HAPPEN TO HATE IT
<Silvermane> DURRRRGAAAANNNN

<Silvermane> Spiced-Ham. Spam
<Pinkie_Pie> I cant see myself reading it
<herospirit> Mmm. Alright.
<Kencolt706> Named by a radio actor in the 30's.
<herospirit> ...And someone just threw poop out the window in Dr. Who...
<herospirit> I like how no one cares.
<herospirit> About them being there.
<Dermathil> WHICH OF HIS STORIES DID THEY PLAY?
<Kencolt706> People DO tend to over look the Doctor.
<NekoGamer> They would be pretty amazed/scared/whatever by her leather jacket
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Calling all Dari's. Attention to all Prince-Dari's, you are requested
<PrincessMolestia> 14You meant here Val? lol
<herospirit> She just wrote history.
<Flutteryay> Money, Success, Fame, Bronies.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nah, just wanted to mention the PM
<Dermathil> THE QUEEN
<PrincessMolestia> 14I'm not sure if Dari is keeping an eye on the chat right now. :P
<Dermathil> ?
<Denied_Existence> ValtheJean *Beep* Loading Dari.exe, Standbye *Breep*
<GGgala_> and so the Doctor fangasms over a historical figure. again.
<Razyn> Hi everypony!
<Dermathil> LOL
<PrincessMolestia> 14lol DE
<Razyn> 0And Val :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy razynm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 razyn* even
<Denied_Existence> *Zzzzzzt* Connection error, 404 admin not found. *Beep*
<Kencolt706> Not the queen.
<Pinkie_Pie> <-- Reading stuff and watching youtube
<Pinkie_Pie> No time to talk for now
<herospirit> Has he not READ Shakespear's stuff? :p
<herospirit> Vulgar was kinda his thing.
<herospirit> XD
<Dermathil> yeah
<herospirit> Alrighty then :P
*Silvermane laughs. Shakespeare would write plays one week ahead of its premier.
<Kencolt706> And so Shakespeare invents the cliffhanger.
<Dermathil> (>has read Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar)
<NekoGamer> I think i'll be watching the Doctor's face pretty much all the time
<Kencolt706> I read them all, long ago...
<NekoGamer> It makes the whole thing even more interesting.
<Silvermane> Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer's Night Dream
<Thunder_Dash> > has only read A Midsummer's Night Dream
<herospirit> No kidding. Dem faces
<Thunder_Dash> 3:
<Dermathil> ETU BRUTI!!!
<Dermathil> YOU TOO BRUTUS
<herospirit> Only "Macbeth" and "Romeo and Juliet" for me
<Kencolt706> And she blows it.
<Dermathil> >yfw I read each of the 3 I read for high school, one per year
<NekoGamer> Finally, they do notice her weird clothes for the time
<Razyn> 0Is this a fair portrayal of Shakespeare?
<Silvermane> probably
<Dermathil> POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD
<Silvermane> He was a famous pervert
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I thought he was a butt buddy?
<NekoGamer> Dat berd
<Silvermane> ValtheJean, can't he be both?
<herospirit> He was an EVERYTHING buddy.
<Kencolt706> That explains a lot...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I guess
<Razyn> 0Shakespeare is now 70% cooler in my book.
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/a4d6b3b0-7c4f-4855-97b9-cf160580f7c5.jpg

<Razyn> 0 /If/ that is true.
<Denied_Existence> *Beep* Process now 0.05% complete.
<Kencolt706> He just drowned from the inside...
<herospirit> I think highschoolers would enjoy Shakespeare more if they understood that half the time he's making jokes about sex and shit :0
<herospirit> Mostly sex.
<Silvermane> Herospirit, i started learning shakespeare in freshman year of HS. with Romeo and Juliet
<DecapKing> i enjoy shakespeare because of that
<DecapKing> and im in high school
<Silvermane> we ALL noticed the double intendre of 'ladies heads' in the opening scene
<GGgala_> i like it f or "what! you egg!"
*Razyn 0shall now approach Shakespeare with a newfound enthusiasm!
<GGgala_> that and "he has killed me mother! *dies*"
<Thunder_Dash> I understood it, but even before I did I have to admit I enjoyed it so :P
<Silvermane> i liked that I was the only one in my class who knew what a Longsword was
<Silvermane> Prince-Dari, my Nephew lieks Bananas. tell him where he can go
<herospirit> It made me sad my freshman year when only a couple people understood the jokes.
<DecapKing> me and the 2 other metal heads got most of the stuff in it
<Dermathil> >yfw Shakespeare is one of the most awesome individuals in history
<Silvermane> he said to say banana. he must LOVE them
<DecapKing> in my class
<Kencolt706> Shakespeare. Sherlock Holme's eraly incarnation.
<Dermathil> %%
<Thunder_Dash> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Dermathil> ^^^
<herospirit> NAAAAAA
<PrincessMolestia> 14Darnit Dari! lol
<NekoGamer> ear rape much
<Razyn> 0DAAAAAAAAAAAAARRIIIIIIII
<Silvermane> he is laughing histarically. and he said to do it again
<herospirit> Dat Dari
<Silvermane> Thanks Prince-dari
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I do wonder when that will finally die off :P
<prince-dari> No problem.
<DecapKing> OH GOD MY EARS!
<prince-dari> INB4 RIP headphone users
*Silvermane loves Prince-Dari
<Silvermane> <3
<prince-dari> <3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<Thunder_Dash> I had a headphone, I'm still alive :p
<GGgala_> HEDWIG NOOOOO
<herospirit> Book seven XD
<Thunder_Dash> *headset
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >yfw I only read up to book 5
<Razyn> 0inb4 Silvermane prince-dari fic
<Dermathil> Wait, didn't that episode come out before Book 7 came out?
<Silvermane> too late
<herospirit> GGgala knows what the IMPORTANT death was.
<Silvermane> NOT HEDWIG
<prince-dari> Dermathil, isn't that the point?
<DecapKing> there is a fic for silverman x y
<Silvermane> NOW WHO WILL I SHIP TO oWLOWICIOUS
<DecapKing> basically everyone
<NekoGamer> I agree with Herospirit.
<Dermathil> Dari, I wasn't sure, that's why I was asking
<herospirit> Val, I only read through 4.
<Razyn> 0I read half way through 1
*Dermathil has read the entire series. BUt hasn't seen movies past the 5th one. Due to the MISSING DETAILS
<herospirit> XD
<Razyn> 0:P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh good, then you weren't nearly as corrupted as I was :P
<Thunder_Dash> same as Razyn XD
*Silvermane read all 7, and was one of the first in his DISTRICT to have read them
<Ziltoid> DERP
<NekoGamer> Don't do drugs kid
<Thunder_Dash> did he died?
<DecapKing> im the only person in my district ot not read them
<herospirit> Don't do kids, drugs
<Ziltoid> O_O
<herospirit> dat face
<Denied_Existence> Also...I think Homestuck has vague pony ref's
<Silvermane> i read Harry Potter in 4th grade, and I was reading book 4 in 6th grade.
<Dermathil> Shakespeare's actor is excellent.
<herospirit> his moustache twiches when he writes.
<Denied_Existence> And some not so vague...such as the one I am reading...
<Thunder_Dash> D_E; just about everything does these days, so I wouldn't be surprised :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 she ends up writing the play that ends up being lost...can't remember what it's called
<FreezeFrame> Shakespeare's writing was pretty raunchy and filled with innuendo, too.
<Razyn> 0Shakespeare's cutie mark is an 'oddly shaped feather'
<Dermathil> lawl
<Silvermane> ^
<Applejack> heeey, what u guys watching
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Dermathil> DOCTOR WHOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Silvermane> Dr. Who
<herospirit> And Denied_Existence, I wish Homestuck had Pony references, but at least the first 3 Acts came out before Ponies :p
<NekoGamer> Cliché much
<Applejack> @.@
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Applejack> Dr Hooves? rly?
<NekoGamer> A witch on a broom...
<Silvermane> which witch?
<Dermathil> no, the real doctor
*Applejack is stunned
<Dermathil> DAVID TENNANT!!!!!
<Applejack> aaalllrgihty then, sugarcube
<Denied_Existence> I think I am on the 4th herospirit
<herospirit> Already? O_O
<NekoGamer> What's that Homestuck thingie ?
<Denied_Existence> Or farther...
<herospirit> Have you gone through the Midnight Crew intermission yet? :0
<Silvermane> I'd love to buy some of these costumes
<Dermathil> yeah right, the queen NEVER turns up
<Razyn> 0Why not make?
<herospirit> And NekoGamer, this: http://www.mspaintadventures.com/
<herospirit> The Midnight Crew intermission is between Acts 3 and 4
<NekoGamer> And what is the deal with it ?
<Razyn> 0Everyone is crazy about it
<herospirit> It gets very good.
<Kencolt706> It's dust.
<Silvermane> dust in the wind?
<Razyn> 0It bit the dust
<Dermathil> TO BE OR NOT TO BE, THAT IS THE QUESTION.
<Silvermane> ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOONN BEYATCH
<Denied_Existence> herospirit, yeah way ahead of that
<Dermathil> ALAS, POOR YORICK!!!!
<Kencolt706> To be or not to be... on the moon?
<Thunder_Dash> stream keeps freezing, is that just me?
<Dark_Heart> I love Shakespearian work
<Dermathil> laggy stream
<Razyn> 0Stream is laggy for me as well
<Kencolt706> Not just you.
<Dermathil> OFFLINE NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<herospirit> stream died.
<Silvermane> Did he died?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he must have blinked
<Dermathil> lawl
<Silvermane> ^
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Kencolt706> Okay... Technical problems with the broadcast.
<Silvermane> keeps freezing for me
<Kencolt706> And offline again.
<Thunder_Dash> came back for me, but it's still freezing
<Kencolt706> And online. And offline And online. And offline. And online.
<Thunder_Dash> dat witch cackle
<Thunder_Dash> it's working again, I think
<Silvermane> CARRIONITE!?!?
<Denied_Existence> herospirit Eventually you will have a loading screen of the chessboard. That is where I am
<Denied_Existence> But don't worry, its just a loading screen (NO SPOILERS FOR YOU HAHA)
<Kencolt706> It's ALWAYS the end of the world.
<herospirit> Poopy. I don't remember when that loading screen was. :0
<herospirit> Oh, I've read everything they have so far. So no spoilers for YOU! >:]
<Denied_Existence> Wait...what?
<Denied_Existence> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!?
<herospirit> :0?
<herospirit> How is what possible? :0
<Silvermane> The play is the thing
<Silvermane> lol
<Kencolt706> so.. EVIL theatre.
<Denied_Existence> Didn't you say only two of them were in the medium so far?
<herospirit> No no, that was someone else :P
<Denied_Existence> Oh, well then...
<herospirit> I think that was GGgala
<herospirit> i can't read THAT fast :P
<Kencolt706> And that is, exactly proper Elizabethan humor.
<GGgala_> herospirit, Denied_Existence eeyup that was me. beginning of Act 4.
<Dermathil> SPINNIES
<Silvermane> spinny?
<Pinkie_Pie> Shall we watch funny videos?
<Kencolt706> What hath Vynyl Wroght?
<Thunder_Dash> saw the word spinny, thought http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131473644908.gif
<herospirit> I'm all mixed up on which Act starts when :P
*Silvermane is surprised when he realizes the Carrionites were in a fanfic
<Silvermane> one of the best Dr. Whooves fanfics out there used them I believed
<Ziltoid> mfw new worms game is a golf game
<Pinkie_Pie> Erm, Nvm
<herospirit> Beatin the crap out if Doc Who. :0
<herospirit> of*
<Dermathil> BADA BOOM
<Kencolt706> You know, whenever someone says the Doc is dead, he's certain to live.
<Kencolt706> "I told thee so" ? Aw, come ON.
<Dermathil> I TOLD THY SO
<herospirit> He told my soul?
<herospirit> blarg
<herospirit> so*

<Kencolt706> There was a misunderstanding...
<Dermathil> I am not sure whether that was a reference to the Torchwood Mansion episode or to the old series
<Dark_Heart> Next episode please

<Dark_Heart> not many

<Silvermane> hope that means chapter 3
<Dark_Heart> next ep please
<ValtheJean> 2,14 all fanfics are shit *trolololo*
<herospirit> I demand final countdown
<Silvermane> how aer you allowed to moderate anything
<herospirit> Val I will SMACK YOU DOWN
<DecapKing> i agree with SIlverMane
<Silvermane> be back soon
<Dark_Heart> ep 3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah cause you know, dari has NEVER trolled in his life :P
<herospirit> ...Okay so I don't actually read much fan fiction.
<Kencolt706> I just had a very wierd thought. Does the Doctor have a hourglass tattoo on his butt?
<herospirit> Of course, Kencolt.
<herospirit> Dat Countdown
<Dermathil> So, Valthejean, how far are you in reading Fallout: Equestria?
<herospirit> Thanks Dari. You are THE GREEETEST.
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I finished the amount that was requested of me
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<prince-dari> No problem.
<DecapKing> did you like it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and then drank some bleach to forget it
<Dark_Heart> noi
<Dermathil> So you read to the latest chapter, Valthejean?
<DecapKing> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU VAL!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no...I read up to 5...because that's what I agreed to
<Dermathil> So someone chickened out of the whole deal. WHO DID THAT.
<herospirit> Val, you'll never like a fanfic because you have fundamentally decided not to. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and honestly you should all be very proud of me. Because I WANTED to put it down so badly, but FORCED myself to continue for the sake of fulfilling the agreement
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's your opinion herospirit, and it's wrong
<Dermathil> And for that we thank you.
<herospirit> Mmm. I think that's at least part of it Val. :P
<Dermathil> Valthejean, pre-built opinions are what herospirit is talking about, and that's what you had before reading the first 5 chapters.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I weighed it as I would any published work. And it met every one of my expectations
<Dermathil> Which were how low, exactly?
<Dark_Heart> can you play ep 3 of dr. who after this?
<herospirit> Dat countdown...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 actually, they were not as low as you'd think
<herospirit> The singer's hair is going to eat us all
<Dermathil> oh, excellent then.
<Dermathil> I assume you found it okay then?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it was exactly what I expected it to be. It was written by someone who had a competant understanding of the English language, which is why so many people mistake it for quality literature
<Dermathil> (I mean just "okay")
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but deeper analysis of character development/plot structure and even the author's intention with said novel makes it nothing above even the average literary work
<Dermathil> Well, you still only read the first 5 chapters
<Dark_Heart> ya
<Dermathil> not much text to evaluate the character development/plot structure obn
<GGgala_> ohai Mr. and Mrs. Pie.
<DecapKing> i dont get a hi?
<herospirit> @pony Pony Pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Pony Pony is 7Mr Br15eezy
<ValtheJean> 2,14 any author will tell you that within the first 3 (or in this case 5 because I agreed to it) chapters of a novel are supposed to present you with a promise
<GGgala_> hi DecapKing :P
<herospirit> HAI DECAP
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a promise of where the story is going, a promise of what you can expect
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Decap
<Pinkie_Pie> @pony Herospirit's love slave
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Herospirit's love slave is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was unimpressed
<GGgala_> >SilverMne
<Pinkie_Pie> That makes no sense.. Does it?
<Dermathil> That's because it is a crossover fanfic.
<herospirit> Wow Steven
<Thunder_Dash> @pony Thunder_Dash
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Thunder_Dash is 15Princess 11Ce9le12st13ia
<GGgala_> he's been disemvoweled! *gasp*
<herospirit> How'd you know
<DecapKing> @pony SilverMane's love slave
<Steven_Magnet> 6 SilverMane's love slave is 6Spik3e
<Thunder_Dash> >mfw
<herospirit> I was a pimp.
<Silvermane> WHAT
<DecapKing> XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a crossover fanfic which everyone kept insisting was quality to me
<Dermathil> NO, you can't go to the planet of the timelords.
<DecapKing> AS IT IS DEAD!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't hide behind the fanfic title now that it hasn't been the holy grail you expected
<Dermathil> Well, among the other fanfics it IS a holy grail.
<DecapKing> exactly
<ValtheJean> 2,14 a polished turd is a turd nontheless
<DecapKing> no
<Dermathil> If you want to see it like that
<DecapKing> it is a polished turd
<Dermathil> but yeah, it is a grail made of turd
<DecapKing> but it is still a grail
<herospirit> I am a pimp, and the Wonderbolts are my bitches. Steven has said it is so.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 my point is this is why I disprove of fanfics. Because even the best of it is not worth my time
<Dermathil> a turd that was polished so much it was put as the centerpiece of a museum
<ValtheJean> 2,14 amongst several hobos perhaps
<herospirit> EWWWW.
*Silvermane has decided to ignore ValtheJean when he comments on anything
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yet never recognized by any actual museum
<herospirit> Can we have a new metaphor please?
<DecapKing> and ignore
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and that's the second reason
<herospirit> Enough turds.
<Dermathil> >mfw it took Silvermane that long to get to that decision
<DecapKing> i just ignored his/her ass
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because when anyone challenges said opinion it's received with hostility
<Razyn> 0Hey guys what's-
<Silvermane> i honestly hated fanfics
<Silvermane> then i read them
*Razyn 0leaves
<Silvermane> and now i love them
<DecapKing> same
<VioletVanilla> ^^^^^ Silermane
<Silvermane> and i don't really care why
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'll put it this way, if you don't want me bad mouthing fanfics, don't talk about them in front of me
<Dermathil> Well, Valthejean, It was a metaphor I did. A metaphor where the Museum was EqD
<DecapKing> me either
<GGgala_> inb4 preachiness
<ValtheJean> 2,14 EqD is a blog about fanfics
<DecapKing> also SilverMane your love slave is spike XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which in the literary world is the equivalent of (at best) a cult
<Silvermane> EQD is a blog about Ponies, including fanfics
<Dermathil> That's why I said it was the centerpiece of the EqD museum
<herospirit> EqD is a blog about Ponies :p
<Dermathil> Valthejean, a cult of which you are a PART OF
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I like watching My Little Pony. I am not any member of a cult
<Dermathil> DAT DOCTOR FACE
<herospirit> Lol wtf just happened there, doc.
<GGgala_> lolwut. freeze?
<Dermathil> Fine, Valthejean. Stay in your denial phase.
<GGgala_> and again a second later?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 care to explain how this is denial?
<DecapKing> im pretty sure that Val is just trolling
<Dermathil> Eventually you'll come to the evidence that you are a brony by hanging out here, whether you like it or not.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I never said I wasn't a brony
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the only requirement to be a brony is to like FiM
<Dermathil> You said you aren't a member of the cult
<ValtheJean> 2,14 everything else is irrelevant
<Dermathil> the cult being the bronies
<Razyn> 0What are we arguing about, and is it really that important?
<herospirit> He meant the cult being fanficers actually
<DecapKing> we are a cult!
<Dermathil> Eh
<herospirit> I don't agree with him, but don't twist his words :p
<ValtheJean> 2,14 thank you herospirit :P

<Kencolt706> you would think it was-- until you clicked and enlarged it.
<Thunder_Dash> Motorway Thought Patrol XD

<Dermathil> Valthejean, they breathe from the exhausts, but that doesn't mean they have FOOD
<Dermathil> you know, a mars bar once in a while
<Silvermane> Dermathil, it said the exhaust WAS food
<Kencolt706> Because they are very very dumb, Val.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I thought he sad they fed on it?
<Silvermane> and they probably kill because they are insane from de-evolution
<herospirit> Yah big ol' face
<Dermathil> They feed on the exhaust gas the same way WE feed on air
<Dermathil> or how a plant feeds on solar energy
<herospirit> Dat Sun

<prince-dari> And without fanfiction we wouldn't have cupcakes.
<Silvermane> prince-dari...
<herospirit> ....
<Silvermane> why
<Kencolt706> You masy stop there.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, heaven forbid what would happen without cupcakes :P
<herospirit> Dari, you're not helping yourself now
<prince-dari> >implying Derpy or Dinky are important
<Silvermane> by the way, Dinky being related to Ditzy is fanfiction in origin
<Silvermane> just like Midnight and Nyx and shipping
<Dermathil> >mfw you're saying all other fanons are awful yet you are thankful for creating Ditzy and Dinky
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I highly doubt that
<DecapKing> i just dreamed that i was chained to the wall again....
<prince-dari> >hear gunshots
<prince-dari> >go upstairs unarmed
<prince-dari> >don't run away and call police
<DecapKing> STOP SPOILING IT!
<Kencolt706> Okay. Odd show...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also derma I never said all other fanons are awful...
<Dermathil> well, YOU JUST DID
<herospirit> Run up and PUNCH THE SHIT out of the guy with the gun
<prince-dari> Jonathon Creek has mindblowing realisations in this show.
<Dermathil> That's what you told Dari a minute ago!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 *sigh* once again. FANFICS=/= FANON
<prince-dari> Greater than House realisations, which is saying something.
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> <ValtheJean>: I dislike them because they are _awful_ fanon
<herospirit> Soooo, is it a murder mystery show?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, and I was refering to fanfics
<prince-dari> >all fanfics are awful
<Dermathil> yeah well fanfics created Ditzy and Dinky's personalities
<prince-dari> >dislike them because they are awful
<prince-dari> Sense much make?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 To be fair, I hold nothing of derpy/dinky's personality a part of fanon, only their relationship
<ValtheJean> 2,14 further more (and again) I highly doubt that derma
<Kencolt706> so... the guy who paints giant naked clown ladies has been murdered. Why is this not surprising?
<Silvermane> disliking awful things makes sense, but them being awful due to disliking doesn't
<Dermathil> well, saying you don't like something because of a subjective point is saying Pineapples taste bad because I hate them
<DecapKing> @ValTheJean Sense:You Make None
<ValtheJean> 2,14 when the hell have I ever said that? good fucking god
*Silvermane wishes the conversation would be dropped already
<herospirit> Val, you's gettin ganged up on
<ValtheJean> 2,14 honestly I don't mind that, I just wish my words weren't being misinterpretted >.<
*Silvermane is tired of this circular argument where everyone goes over the same points repeatedly
<Denied_Existence> Herospirit Now I must attempt to decide if the trolls are supposed to relate to something...
<herospirit> What do you mean by "relate to something"? :p
<DecapKing> i gave up watching the show on the stream, and just went back to my metal
<herospirit> Talking about Homestuck, before anyone asks :P
<prince-dari> Val, you hate all fanfics, you hate them because they are bad fanon, why are they bad fanon, because all fanfics are inherently bad.
<prince-dari> Sense make much?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see, now you're twisting my words
<DecapKing> makes none to me
<prince-dari> That's just what you said.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, that's just how you chose to construct them :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fanfics are bad fanon BECAUSE of a lack of any substantial quality
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they are literally without merit
<Denied_Existence> I have no clue...just speculating for some reason
<Denied_Existence> Don't worry Dari, I am writing a fan fiction JUST FOR HIM
<Silvermane> Throughout my career, I've always been able to recover very quickly in the face of the bizarre, but there is a great difference between a floating psychic in a gas mask reading my PlayStation save data and waking up in a barn apparently owned and operated by a red horse with an apple tattoo on its ass.
<Denied_Existence> Aint I so nice?
<Kencolt706> I suspect that we have met the detective of this show.
<prince-dari> Now I could illegitimise my whole arguement here.
<prince-dari> And I really want to.
<DecapKing> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
<prince-dari> Because it's such an awesome way to do it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, you kind of already did with the cupcakes thing :P
<DecapKing> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
<prince-dari> Ok.
<herospirit> Okay, what Dari means to ask I believe, is if not all fanon is bad, why is all fanfiction bad?
<Silvermane> Cupcakes was a work of art
<prince-dari> Here we go.
<Silvermane> I LOVED cupcakes, once my head stopped screaming with pain
<DecapKing> Cupcakes was actually fairly good
<DecapKing> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
<Dermathil> DecapKing, stop it.
<Dermathil> You're spamming.
<Denied_Existence> Fanfiction is properly justified as a legitimate source of speculation of characterization and entertaining extremities.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 legitimate how?
<prince-dari> You're just generalising without getting all the facts, you're not read every fanfic in existence, you just assume all lack 'substance', that's just like someone deciding tha all people in one gender, religion, or race are all the same. YOU RACIST! There, I hope you're happy, my arguement is now in flames.
<prince-dari> that*
<ValtheJean> 2,14 to be fair dari, you missed an important part :P
<Denied_Existence> Lol, I just threw a bunch of buzzwords together just then...and still sounded like I knew what i was saying...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because that's what was said before
<Dermathil> actually, dari hasn't illegimized his argument. He basically explained the WHOLE FUCKING ISSUE in four lines.
<Denied_Existence> (Not that I don't know what I was saying)
<Dermathil> And I thank you GREATLY for that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and then the offer for me to read FO:E, the supposed example of a good fanfic was offered
<ValtheJean> 2,14 superfluous offer much? oiy...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think this is a fair way to leave this conversation:
<Denied_Existence> FO:E was pretty good. Actually written like a book.
<Silvermane> honestly, in mathematics a single point does not a function prove
<herospirit> Val, if fanon isn't all bad, why is fanfiction all bad? Is it just a massive coincidence that only the bad fanons get written down?
<Dermathil> Valthejean, you are basically acting like the people who watch FiM and in the first 5 minutes decide that the show is SHIT because it is about ponies. Except you find that the story is SHIT because it is a fanfic
<Dermathil> ^^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 present to me an example of a good fanfic, and I will retract my statements of it
<Silvermane> Black and White
<prince-dari> Good is subjective.
<prince-dari> :P
<DecapKing> SIRS IT IS ALL ABOUT PERSONAL OPPINION, PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO FORCE YOUR OPINION ON OTHERS!
<Silvermane> read that
<Kencolt706> World of Ponycraft.
<Denied_Existence> Bamn, headshot
<prince-dari> LOL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well then that completely nullifies the entire point of the discussion dari
<prince-dari> Dem police
<Denied_Existence> In fact, I still need to read that
<prince-dari> So polite and British.
*Silvermane thinks that crossovers and Adventure-fics are bad ways to indoctrinate into fanfic enjoyment
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because if we're dealing in matters of the subjective, then there IS no good or bad, and as such both parties are incorrect
<prince-dari> Don't want to make a scene in the cinema while people are watching a film.
<herospirit> I seriously want to know if you have a theory on why fanfiction is always bad if fanon is not, ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 herospirit: because I've seen good fanon, and I have not seen good fanfiction
<herospirit> but I mean
<Denied_Existence> Oooooooh, I want this theory too...I must catalogue it in my files on psychology.
<Denied_Existence> Er...cause...you know...keeping files is entirely normal.
<prince-dari> Well it is irrational to assume that all fanfics are bad, because it is near impossible that there's not a single one in existence that you wouldn't enjoy.
<DecapKing> http://ts1.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=1058433935464&id=ddf68fc9dbb76df2d5d1243971497662&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ponychan.net%2fchan%2fpic%2fsrc%2f130236442832.png YOU ARGUING MAKES FLUTTERSHY CRY!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's as irrational to assume there IS one I would enjoy :P
<Denied_Existence> And if there isn't one now, there will be one eventually!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering the very nature of a fanfic frustrates me
<Dermathil> Valthejean, I guess you should include comics in fanfiction btw. Because it is a story, except it is expressed in image form rather than with words.
<herospirit> ValtheJean: but I mean, if you have a theory on this, WHY is all the fanfiction bad? If good fanon exists, why do only bad ones get written down?
<Denied_Existence> Because, the likeliness that a fan fiction you will like never ∞:1
<ValtheJean> 2,14 derma: no, the comic book industry is not included in literature, so I will use similar basis
<Denied_Existence> *never appearing is ∞:1
<Kencolt706> Wait... let me get this straight. You are arguing that fanfics are bad-- all bad-- by virtue of BEING fanfics?
<herospirit> He doesn't mean comic books, he means MlP fan comics
<Dermathil> >mfw my literature teachers say the EXACT opposite of what Valthejean says
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no kencolt, just that they frustrate me
*Silvermane FOR FUCKS SAKE DROP IT ALL OF YOU
<Kencolt706> And why do they frustrate you?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well then it's different in your country than here derma
<Dermathil> (actually, that's exactly what he means, Kencolt.)
<DecapKing> PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
*Silvermane I AM A VERY CALM PERSON AND YOU ARE ANNOYING ME VIA TEXT FOR GODS SAKE
<PrincessMolestia> 14I MAD!
<Dermathil> Valthejean, it was a class about american literature
<herospirit> Silvermane.... U mad, bro?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry, then your teacher was wrong. As that is not how the industry works
<Silvermane> Herospirit, don't start.
<herospirit> I apologize.
*Silvermane NO MORE ARGUING. MOCK THE DAMN MOVIE, TALK ABOUT PONIEs, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but, seeing as how this is frustrating silvermane, I suggest we leave this discussion for a time he is not online
<DecapKing> this argument, making me homicidal
*Kitten growls and climbs up into the dark rafters
<herospirit> Really, no sarcasm, I actually apologize. I should've dropped this a while ago.
<Denied_Existence> ValtheJean By my calculations (Minus the random chance of a sudden life-ending event), the likeliness that a fan fiction you will like being created is bordering the 87% level.
<Denied_Existence> And thats allowing for any number of earth-rending event...
<Dermathil> alright then
<Denied_Existence> Yay scientific calculations!
<Denied_Existence> So much fun
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol denied, did you use steven for that or something? :P
<Kencolt706> I see a murder coming up.
<Denied_Existence> Also, did you know the likeliness that somepony would eventually create cupcakes is nearly 68%?
<herospirit> The easiest murder ever :P
<Denied_Existence> No, I do these calculations myself
<herospirit> But... you can't calculate infinite time.
<Dashite> Did you guys know that the likelihood of people creating proper aspect ratio wallpapers is 0%? :(
<Denied_Existence> Although it does involve a lot of guesswork.
<Denied_Existence> herospirit No, but I can allow for it.
<Denied_Existence> Dashite actually, its 0.054792% *trollface*
<Kencolt706> Actually, you can calculate for infinite time. It just takes really really long.\
<herospirit> What timespan did you use? If you assumed infinite time, all probabilities would be 100%. :0
<Silvermane> using approximation as x approaches infinity tactics?
<DecapKing> did you know the likelyhood of PrincessMolestia chaining ponies to walls is 100%?
<prince-dari> >I want to lie beside her in a bath of warm glue
<Dashite> Damn you Denied. :p
<prince-dari> Wut
<herospirit> dat glue
<Kencolt706> OKay-- anyone that clueless HAS to be a great detective.
<Dashite> 1920x1080 is so easy to create by cropping a proper 1920x1200. :(
<VioletVanilla> DON'T BE USING YER FANCY MATHEMATICS TO MUDDY THE ISSUE D<
<Denied_Existence> herospirit, that would require the assumption that humanity lived for infinity...which I calculate only a maybe 3.475x10^-245 chance of.
<Thunder_Dash> > mfw my headset is plugged into charge and it starts beeping as if it's running out of battery
<Thunder_Dash> *in to charge
<VioletVanilla> ^ Happens to my mouse all the time x.x
<herospirit> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S TALK ABOUT PONIES.
<herospirit> Who is everyone's favorite ponies?
<Denied_Existence> Although, I suppose you could take into account the likeliness that an afterlife or re-incarnation exists...but those calculations are WAY too wild for me
<Denied_Existence> Rainbow Dash
<prince-dari> OH GOD HEROSPIRIT
<prince-dari> ARE YOU TROLLING OR WHAT?! :P
<DecapKing> I SAY WE TALK ABOUT MUFFINS!

<VioletVanilla> Oooh child~ Feel the warmth of the love when I stick it to youuuuu~
<VioletVanilla> Outsiiiiiide ;3
<DecapKing> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FLUTTERSHY!
<Denied_Existence> Sorry, I am the element of loyalty myself...so...yeah..
<VioletVanilla> In order
<Dashite> VioletVanilla, wat?! O.o

<VioletVanilla> Luna, Rainbow Dash, Apple Jack, Twilight, Pinkie Pie, Trixie.
<VioletVanilla> And Derpy, can't forget Derpy. <3
<Thunder_Dash> I can't decide on who my favorite is D:
<Denied_Existence> Want any more calculations?
<Thunder_Dash> brb
<Denied_Existence> My brain is just warming up!
<herospirit> I dunno my favorite. Maybe Twilight. Possibly Fluttershy.
<Dashite> Denied, never tell me the odds!
<Kencolt706> I'm kindof torn between Twi and Flutters myself.
<Denied_Existence> But the odds are cool....
<herospirit> I always like my odds even one against a million, shouldn't be confusion cause I've never been a villain, don't know what to call me you can call me what they call me back home-
<herospirit> RED CYCLONE
<DecapKing> Fluttershy, Big Mac, Ditzy & Dinky, Pinkie Pie, RainbowDash, Spike, Twilight, AppleJack, CCM, Rarity
<Denied_Existence> Come on! Give me something to calculate! I dare you!
<Thunder_Dash> back
<Silvermane> REMEMBER: If the odds are ever exactly one in a million, then it is guarenteed to happen!
<prince-dari> Because this is the first episode it's longer than they normally are.
<Kencolt706> That cursor was picking her nose...
<prince-dari> And is therefore a bit slower.
<Denied_Existence> Silvermane Only if you are basing it upon a finite time period.
<DecapKing> @meter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 11% . (1538)
<DecapKing> @ameter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 36% a. (1539)
<Silvermane> Denied_Existence, nope, basing it on the causality of narration and drama
<Kencolt706> A nuclear... ohhh-kaaaayy.

<herospirit> Silvermane
<Silvermane> ?
<Denied_Existence> Silvermane Oh, well in narration that does tend to be a cliché
<herospirit> Do you read Terry Pratchett by any chance?
<Silvermane> :D HE GOT IT
<herospirit> I AM WINNER.
<Silvermane> If you build a man afire, he will be warm for a day
<Silvermane> If you set a man on fire, he will be warm for the rest of his life
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<herospirit> :D
<Denied_Existence> OHOHOHO
<Denied_Existence> I see what you did there!
<ValtheJean> 2,14if you set a city on fire...it's fucking hillarious
<Denied_Existence> And then if you sit on a rock and play a fiddle...
<Denied_Existence> Then your Nero
<herospirit> If you set a fire on fire... are you a eizard?
<Silvermane> Mimes are to be imprisoned in a pit full of scorpions and a sign, reading "Learn the Words"
<Denied_Existence> ~yay~
<DecapKing> and if you pass out near PrincessMolestia
<DecapKing> you will be raped
<Denied_Existence> Yay?
<Silvermane> rape implies not wanting it
<herospirit> Silvermane has a point
<Denied_Existence> Well that would really depend...
<Silvermane> (legally it implies much more than that, but it's funnier this way)
<DecapKing> unless one person is underaged
<prince-dari> And so it begins.
<Silvermane> bah statutory. long discussion, not worth the time for now
<Dashite> Help, help! I need an adult!
<Silvermane> I am an adult
<Dashite> ...
<Suffuri> well.
<Denied_Existence> I was saying my depend in relation to Decap's post
<Kencolt706> So... she's nosy, and he's brilliant.
<Suffuri> what're we watchin
<DecapKing> wtf is this show even about?
<Dashite> Flutteryay is Pinkamina? Interesting...
<Denied_Existence> I demand you test my abilities!
<DecapKing> what are you talkinga bout?
<Denied_Existence> Ohai SirSprinkles, test my abilities to calculate the odds of various things, I dare you.
<SirSprinkles> 6What is the chance I care?
<herospirit> what are the chances that falling asleep near Molestia would result in rape?
<herospirit> I ASKED FIRST D:<
<DecapKing> that depends if you like it herospirit
<Dashite> 0% and 100%
<SirSprinkles> 6I ASKED WITH COLOR
<Dashite> You also asked first...
<SirSprinkles> 6D:<
<herospirit> Give me the answer to both
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Denied_Existence> Since you asked that question, the likeliness that you cared for one nanosecond is 100%
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope, I just wanted you to waste your time typing out an answer.
<SirSprinkles> 6Trolololol
<prince-dari> Incoming Jonathon Creek epic
<DecapKing> DAT PINK BOX
<Denied_Existence> The thought crossed your mind, therefore you cared *trollface*
<SirSprinkles> 6PINK SQUARE
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Denied_Existence> Eeeeeeeeyup
<SirSprinkles> 6Just because a thought is in my brain doesn't mean I care.
<prince-dari> HOW DID HE DO IT?!
<prince-dari> OH MY GOD
<prince-dari> Then he explains it.
<prince-dari> And ruins the moment.
<Denied_Existence> You can argue logic all you want, but you still thought about it for a finite amount of time. And even if you don't care now, you cared enough to ask wether you cared or not.
<herospirit> FUCKING MAGNETS
<Denied_Existence> And therefore you cared.
<Denied_Existence> Also, that thought about caring or not extends backwards to near infinity
<herospirit> He is the greetest.
<Kencolt706> Ack in the day, I learned a bit about majic-- and that's pretty much what it is.
<DecapKing> wtf is this show about?
<prince-dari> MAD COW PRODUCTIONS
<prince-dari> Wait wut
<herospirit> I must away
<Kencolt706> A murdered artist who painted giant naked clown ladies.
<DecapKing> why does that sound familiar?

<prince-dari> Dat Jonathon Creek mysticism
<prince-dari> What is going on in your head?
<prince-dari> I must know!
<prince-dari> HOW DID SHE DO IT?!
<prince-dari> TELL ME!
<Denied_Existence> Welp, 73% chance Dari is too wrapped in the show currently to talk to me...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 there is a 99.99999% chance Val has no idea what is going on in the chat or the stream because he had visitors :P
<Kencolt706> Soo... he lives in a windmill. That's almost pony-like.
<prince-dari> His parents live in Phillydelphia
<DecapKing> i think its spelled Fillydelphia
<Denied_Existence> I think you may be correct Val, but reaching 100% requires some more calculations...give me a second and I can figure out whether it was .00001% more than you thought.
<prince-dari> Ah.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I see, my thanks denied :P
<Denied_Existence> Hey, even a tiny bit between 99 and 100% is a whole lot.
<prince-dari> Jonthaon.
<prince-dari> You're a genius
<Thunder_Dash> that's bloody ingenious
<DecapKing> DUN DUN DUN
<DecapKing> how long is this show?
<Kencolt706> And here's the twist...
<prince-dari> Normally 1 hour episodes.
<Thunder_Dash> this episode's an hour and a half, i dunno how far in we are
<prince-dari> This is the first so it's 1 hour 30 mins I think.
<prince-dari> Not sure.
<DecapKing> wtf?
<Thunder_Dash> dat chair
<DecapKing> how is she doing that?
<prince-dari> I want that chair.

<Thunder_Dash> oh shi
<Denied_Existence> Should I calculate the epicness?

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Johnathon_Creek is 68% epic. (1542)
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> FAIL
<DecapKing> indeed sir, with your fucking statistics

<Denied_Existence> NO YOU FOOL, THAT WAS A SPELL TO PROTECT US!!!!!
<DecapKing> is that why you havent been chaining people up anymore?
<PrincessMolestia> 14But I have toons on several other servers too.
<Denied_Existence> YOU JUST GAVE HER FULL POWER!
<Kencolt706> Dalaran myself... and the rest is a secret.
<PrincessMolestia> 14For now Decap. :P
<Denied_Existence> Although, that doesn't mean I'M complaining...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 damn, I must have messed up my macros
<PrincessMolestia> 14Second DK is at level 66 right now, yayy~
<Kencolt706> His logic is impeccable.
<Denied_Existence> Woah, now thats a mouthful...
<Kencolt706> And she now feels as foolish as she acts.
<prince-dari> SUDDEN EPIC REVELATION
<CAJ> what else has that guy been in
<CAJ> the shaggy hair guy
<prince-dari> EPIPHANY FOR GREAT JUSTICE
<Denied_Existence> Pass your rine.
<prince-dari> He's in QI.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Mmm, the song Wooden Toaster made to the fic, Rainbow Factory is good. I keep listening to it.
<DecapKing> I SHALL FIND YOU AND TROLL YOU ON WOWO MOLESTIA!
<PrincessMolestia> 14:P
<Denied_Existence> ......?
<PrincessMolestia> 14I'm "Trollestia" on this server...
<PrincessMolestia> 14Cause I'm a troll... get it? DOH HO HO
<Denied_Existence> Decap has only a 89% chance of understanding himself.
<prince-dari> He fathomed it, incoming epic explanation.
<prince-dari> INB4 murder
<Denied_Existence> >Egyption rape scene?
<PrincessMolestia> 14Hawt!
<Denied_Existence> >Correction: Egyption fursuit rape scene.
<Kencolt706> And this ISN'T in Las Vegas?
<Denied_Existence> Kinky
<Thunder_Dash> I KNEW that would happen
<Kencolt706> I predicted it about an hour ago...
<DecapKing> what about New Vegas?
<Denied_Existence> Woah, boggling my mind here.
<prince-dari> Pfft, well no one predicted hwo the murder happened.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Here comes the epic explanation
<Denied_Existence> It reminds me of this one time my father and a few other men where on stage holding onto pillars...then a car appeared above them on the pillars...
<Denied_Existence> He was like WTF!?
<prince-dari> AndHereWeGo.jpg
<DecapKing> WTF?
<prince-dari> YFW Jonathon's first brilliant explanation was just the warm up.
<Denied_Existence> We expect you to say: "I am guilty"
<PrincessMolestia> 14I think Decap is stalking me. D:
<prince-dari> This is the main course.
<Denied_Existence> Is that even possible Princess?
<PrincessMolestia> 14lol This is true DE
<prince-dari> Now.
<prince-dari> There is just one thing to say for that explanation.
<DecapKing> nah
<Denied_Existence> ........?
<DecapKing> im just trolling her
<Thunder_Dash> that's some epic deduction right there
<ValtheJean> 2,14 rofl dari
<Kencolt706> And his timing is appalling..
<DecapKing> and its easier when she can see me troll her with text
<Denied_Existence> If you stalk me princess, and I stalk Val, and He stalks Decap...THEN WILL WILL HAVE A STALKING SQUARE!
<Denied_Existence> Or if you prefer equation style: S^2
<Kencolt706> don't do it man.
<prince-dari> >sadistically molested by vacuum cleaners
<prince-dari> He LOVED it
<Kencolt706> liar.
<Denied_Existence> BUT WHO WAS FONE!?
<Thunder_Dash> AND THEN A SKELETON POPPED OUT
<Denied_Existence> Dari! Get a webcam and do a little dance for us!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 elementary my dear Dari!
<prince-dari> Denied_Existence: Sure, I'll do that for you sometime.
<Denied_Existence> Chances of dance being awesome: 97.576%
<Kencolt706> I still wanted 10 million fluttershys...

<PrincessMolestia> 14So much Fluttershy
*CAJ uses hair whip

<PrincessMolestia> 14Dem imaginary numbers that arent numbers. lol
*Denied_Existence uses statistics!!!! Chance of CAJ losing the battle: 78.048047%

*Denied_Existence throws a PōnyBall!
<CAJ> hey

*CAJ gets caught anyway
<Denied_Existence> CAJ was caught!
<Denied_Existence> *AwesomeMusic*
<Kencolt706> I just love that song. I don't know why. I just do.
<Denied_Existence> Play: Your gonna go far kid (Mlp version)
<Kencolt706> You got any Monty Python?
<PrincessMolestia> 14Rainbow Factory is an awesome song too.
<DecapKing> do what DE said
<Denied_Existence> Yes
<Denied_Existence> Hmm.......I WILL NAME IT FLUFFY
<Kencolt706> Eh, it's ok-- I do have the complere DVD set for my fix.

<prince-dari> >I'm still up watching pony
<prince-dari> Lawl
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol dari
<prince-dari> >dad doesn't even bother coming to check
<prince-dari> He knows by now.
<Denied_Existence> Lulz
<DecapKing> my mom doesnt even give a shit that im still up
<CAJ> not a single fuck was given that day
<Denied_Existence> *EXTREME.HEADBANG*
<Thunder_Dash> both of my parents know about both A) ponies and B) my erratic sleep schedule
<prince-dari> Hell, my mum pretty much keeps the same sleep schedule as me.
<Thunder_Dash> i don't think they really care about either except when I end up spending the whole damn day in bed P:
<Kencolt706> My sister in law thinks I'm insane because I watch this show... and doesn't even notice my huge old school anime collection. :P
<Denied_Existence> Tell her she should watch it
<prince-dari> I'd dance for you to this video.
<Kencolt706> I have.
<Denied_Existence> Pony swag perhaps?
<CAJ> cool song, brp
<CAJ> >brp
<Denied_Existence> Love me some Swag
<Kencolt706> Not a bad tune after all.
<CAJ> ooh yes
<CAJ> pony swag
<CAJ> do it
<CAJ> yussss
<Denied_Existence> ~yay~
<Kencolt706> There's a project of some bronies rewriting Beatles songs to ponystyle out there...
<Kencolt706> Yes, on Youtube... I forget what the channel name is.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Bleh, my suggestion got ignored.
<Denied_Existence> Next, either Like a BAWS or Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy.
<Kencolt706> Or Sgt. Pinkies Lonely Hearts CLub Band.
<CAJ> or Baby god Flank
<CAJ> >god
<CAJ> got
<Kencolt706> That is an actual song, by the way...
<Denied_Existence> No fluffy, that is a horrible idea.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Okay, now you're just playing it to humor me. lol
<PrincessMolestia> 14Aww, thats not the PMV. But its still a good song.
<Denied_Existence> NotSureIfHeadbang.jpg
<Kencolt706> 10 million FLuttershys has a PMV...
<PrincessMolestia> 14Its based off the fanfic. Which I've not read. But still like the song.
<Denied_Existence> OH REALLY?
<PrincessMolestia> 14Oooh.
<Kencolt706> And isn't THAT a cue?
<Denied_Existence> Need some LIKE A BAWS aswell
<prince-dari> Already played it today
<Kencolt706> Is she trying toeat her hoof?
<Denied_Existence> Wait...so I ALREADY MISSED IT!?
<Kencolt706> Not bitchy-- whiny.
<Denied_Existence> Darn...
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<prince-dari> I love that strut
<prince-dari> When she's walking towards Steven Magnet with wet hair.
<Kencolt706> The ironic part is we can all watch any of these whenever we want-- on Youtube-- but we can't make bad and often perverse jokes about them.
<Denied_Existence> YOU SHOULD NOT GO
<Denied_Existence> ADAPT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 awwwwwww
<DecapKing> DONT LEAVE US DARI!
<Denied_Existence> EVOLVE INTO A MOLE OR BAT
<Thunder_Dash> Okay :3
<PrincessMolestia> 14Dari, did you play Rainbow Factory just so I wouldnt whine? :P

<GGgala_> night dari
<Thunder_Dash> haha Val, same here, I had a bunch of unfinished work I was supposed to do over summer and I barely did any
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I suppose since there's no stream, and CERTAIN people are off playing WoW...I might as well do it now
<Thunder_Dash> I'm probably just going to stay here as I have nothing to do and don't feel like going to bed yet
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so yeah, I think I'll be off too. I'll most likely go to sleep when I finish so I'll see everyone in the morning
<Thunder_Dash> I am going to switch to a client though, so I'll be right back :P
<Thunder_Dash> 'Night Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good night all, make sure to post ponies while I'm gone :P
<Denied_Existence> I'm going too. Goodnight.
<Denied_Existence> ALSO, FEAR NOT, FOR VAL FICTION IS IN THE WORKINGS
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<Denied_Existence> *EVILLAUGH*
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Decap
<GGgala_> so DecapKing, when did you cease being a mere DecapPony? I missed the coronation!
<SirSprinkles> 6SPRINKLES OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE
<GGgala_> ohai SirSprinkles
<PrincessMolestia> 14lol Hai thar Sprinkles outta fucken nowhere!
<mib_s4eyc1> So, who's in charge of this little shindig?
<Dashite> Me
<mib_s4eyc1> Is it safe to assume you will be streaming season 2 when it starts?
<Dashite> Yes
<mib_s4eyc1> would you mind if I mentioned it in a sticky somewhere over in /pony/ at your convenience?
<mib_s4eyc1> Or are you hoping to avoid the swarms that that would release upon you?
<Thunder_Dash> speaking of which, is there going to be a stream of S1 before S2? I remember someone asking that during... I think the first LoTR movie
<Dashite> Wouldn't bother me at all. *Note: I'm not actually in charge of anything around here. I just lurk all the time.*
<mib_s4eyc1> I had guessed that might be the case. :P
<mib_s4eyc1> It seemed awfully convenient.
<Dashite> Dari and Sprinkles would be the ones in charge.
<mib_s4eyc1> And are they currently online?
<mib_s4eyc1> How would I go about contacting them?
<Dashite> Well, they are currently listed as being in the channel.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Dashite isnt in charge of this place. :P
<mib_s4eyc1> I know, but if he lurks here, he might be of SOME use
<Dashite> Sprinkles has been idle for the last 10 minutes and Dari for longer than that.
<Thunder_Dash> Dari's bot is always here to the best of my knowledge, and I think Sprinkles is here
<Dashite> Dari
<Dashite> Dari
<Dashite> Dari
<Dashite> Dari
<Dashite> Maybe that will get his attention.
<PrincessMolestia> 14As for mentioning it over on pony, thats fine.
<mib_s4eyc1> Oh, I mean in a sticky
<PrincessMolestia> 14Its not secret really we plan to be live streaming S2 as it airs. :P
<Thunder_Dash> Hi Decap
<DecapKing> im going to be away from chat while im doing my homework
<PrincessMolestia> 14You mean its own sticky?
<mib_s4eyc1> sort of
<mib_s4eyc1> edit in the link into the existing sticky in pony
<SirSprinkles> 6...what's going on now?
<mib_s4eyc1> You're in charge of this?
<PrincessMolestia> 14I thought we already had a link in the existing thread.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Its a group effort. lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, there are three admins that run it, Octy.
<mib_s4eyc1> Oh, I'm RainbowDash, the mod over at ponychan
<PrincessMolestia> 14Well, I like to think of it as a group effort still.
<SirSprinkles> 6-_-; It is, Octy, but regardless...
<mib_s4eyc1> I just wanted to know if I could add a link to this stream in the OP of the existing sticky in pony
<SirSprinkles> 6One moment.
<DecapKing> whats going on?
<SirSprinkles> 6I have no problem with it. If something comes up where the other admins disagree, which I doubt, I'll make sure to contact you to ask to take it down.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though again, I doubt that'll happen.
<PrincessMolestia> 14Hmm...
<mib_s4eyc1> okay, my main concern is that you might not be able to take the full load that that would bring upon you
<DecapKing> who's the anon?
<mib_s4eyc1> I don't know anything about how this is all set up, mind you
<mib_s4eyc1> !!RainbowDash ##Mod#, over at ponychan
<SirSprinkles> 6We're already preparing setup for a rather large amount of traffic come season 2, so it would only be helpful.
<mib_s4eyc1> I probably should have set my name as something useful. ._.
<DecapKing> well im DecapKing
<DecapKing> AKA DecapMan, xxHeadremoverxx, etc
<mib_s4eyc1> Hello there
<DecapKing> ive also been called Lucifer, Satan, Diablo
<mib_s4eyc1> nifty
<mib_s4eyc1> super keen
<SirSprinkles> 6But yeah, I have no problem with it, and would appreciate it, and see no reason the other admins would have issue with it either, since we'd only be pushing for it at a later date anyway.
<mib_s4eyc1> so, I have the go ahead?
<SirSprinkles> 6Go for it.
<mib_s4eyc1> any other info you would like me to add?
<DecapKing> altough i will not wait till i can devour your sould
<DecapKing> *soul
<mib_s4eyc1> what time you'll be streaming, or whatnot?
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll be streaming the episodes live as they come out.
<DecapKing> probally whenever the episodes come on
<DecapKing> so roughly 6:30pm eastern
<PrincessMolestia> 14I said that already, but y'know...
<DecapKing> or whenever it comes on
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes Octy, I'm just confirming.
<PrincessMolestia> 14When they first air.
<mib_s4eyc1> It never hurts to confirm anything
<PrincessMolestia> 14We're streaming that 8am or such one right?
<PrincessMolestia> 14I think it plays twice that day.
<SirSprinkles> 6Whatever time it is, yes.
<Dashite> 9am saturday morning.
<PrincessMolestia> 14On the 17th.
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, everything live as it comes out.
<mib_s4eyc1> alrighty then
<Thunder_Dash> > mfw realize in order for me to see them live I need to get up before 6 in the morning
<mib_s4eyc1> I'll go start on that
<mib_s4eyc1> thanks for your help!
<SirSprinkles> 6np
<SirSprinkles> 6Thanks for checking with us.
<Dashite> You're welcome. :)
<SirSprinkles> 6...-_-;
<DecapKing> You are welcome
<DecapKing> see you in hell
<SirSprinkles> 6...-_-;
<Dashite> Hey, someone had to keep him company until you mods showed up!
<PrincessMolestia> 14Dashite lol
<PrincessMolestia> 14Well, people ignore me anyway. lol
<PrincessMolestia> 13Noticeable colors go!
<Dashite> :p
<DecapKing> thats cause you ignore us by playing WoW.....
<SirSprinkles> 6You're a new mod, Octy, of course people ignore you.
<PrincessMolestia> 13This is true Decap. lol
<DecapKing> AND YOU CHAINED ME TO A BLOODY WALL!
<Dashite> Holy crap, Octy is a mod?! I didn't notice.
<PrincessMolestia> 13lol
<Thunder_Dash> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6...-_-;
<Dashite> Wow, thanks for the information Sprinkles! I'll be sure to give my congratulations next time I see Octy around here!
<Thunder_Dash> I can tell, just cause I'm not using mibbit :P
<Dashite> Next you'll be telling me that ValtheJean is a mod. Heh, like that would ever happen. Haven't seen him around talking much lately...
<PrincessMolestia> 13Lmao
<DecapKing> uhhhh
<PrincessMolestia> 13Hes trollin
<DecapKing> sadly, the archdemon is
<DecapKing> also so am i
<Dashite> The Point
<Dashite> |
<Dashite> |
<Dashite> V
<Dashite> DecapKing
<Thunder_Dash> I don't mean to impose by asking this again, but I know somepony asked at some point during one of the LoTR streams if there were any plans to stream Season 1 as a whole before Season 2, are there?
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying we haven't already streamed all of S1 in one day
<SirSprinkles> 6...we might though, need to discuss it.
<Dashite> That wasn't implying any such thing. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6Can't give a definite yes or no.
<Thunder_Dash> well, I only really heard about this because of the LoTR stream, so if it was it was before then
<Dashite> It was several months ago.
<DecapKing> http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3bff959307e1b483f51d6033be4b2a0d/52157%20-%20anger%20celestia%20comic%20fluttershy%20luna%20twilight_sparkle.png
<PrincessMolestia> 13Luna: FUUUUUUUUUUUUU...
<PrincessMolestia> 13I'm so Fluttershy.
<Thunder_Dash> I'm fine without an answer, I was just curious as to if there was one yet :P
<Dashite> I'm Celestia.
<SirSprinkles> 6>several months
<SirSprinkles> 6>it was the end of July
<Dashite> Was it that recent?
<SirSprinkles> 6>just a little over a month ago
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, it was Christmas in July.
<SirSprinkles> 6We did it July 25th.
<Dashite> Yes, yes it was.
<Dashite> I remember that now.
<Dashite> I remember missing the first 9 episodes because I was in class.
<SirSprinkles> 6I remember being here for all of them.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because I'm a mod.
<DecapKing> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/52041
<Dashite> I remember being here, I just don't always remember when they were.
<Thunder_Dash> if there's another one, I plan on being here, but what time would it be likely to start at, if you don't mind me asking?
<Dashite> The last one started at 12:00 noon EST.
<Thunder_Dash> taking time differences into account, if there's another one, I can manage that
<Dashite> You're PST right?
<Thunder_Dash> Yeah, so it'd be 9AM for me
<Synros> hey everyone
<Thunder_Dash> hi Synros

<Dashite> Did you type that as "... okay then" or
<Synros> yah there are... they were used to get rid of all the humans
<Dashite> "...okay then"
<Thunder_Dash> you mean with or without a space? Typed it with one
<Dashite> That's what I thought.
<Dashite> I should get rid of that part of the script...
<Thunder_Dash> huh?
<Dashite> The script I have that allows me to do this:
<Dashite> Huzzah
<Dashite> Or...
<Dashite> Er...
<Dashite> .. / -- . .- -. / - .... .. ...
<Dashite> Also automatically trannslates morse code in others posts.
<Thunder_Dash> Oh, okay
<Dashite> And if you just put ... alone somewhere it'll remove all the spaces in the rest of the message. :p
<Thunder_Dash> Ah, I see. :P
<Dashite> 0,14T7e8s3t9i11n4g
<Synros> wait so who the hell is Discord?
<Dashite> Antagonist
<Thunder_Dash> of at least the first two episodes, though we still don't know much beyond that (unless I missed something?)
<Synros> hmm
<Synros> this could be interesting
<Synros> just read a snipit about him
<Synros> sounds like its going to be a copy of the first 2 episode, but with a guy this time :(
<Thunder_Dash> yeah, that's kinda the impression I got too, but I'm hoping that's not what happens
<Synros> yah, one can only hope
<Synros> if they come out with a male version of Trixie, I'm just going to die inside
<Thunder_Dash> hi Wrek

<Synros> yah, a little much tere
<Synros> everyone know Brazil is good for only one this
<Synros> mango punch.
<DecapPony> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/27/demotivational-posters-vampires-theyre-contagious/

<Synros> wtf!?
<DecapPony> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/26/demotivational-posters-honesty-2/
<Synros> you got punched my a chinese Wrek?
<Wrek> 5its a drink in Deus Ex, and the bartender responds with, the punch or the drink?
<Synros> lol
<Wrek> 5i chuckled when i first heard it
<Synros> hows the game?
<Wrek> 5*giggle*
<Synros> its just the name that...gets me
<Wrek> 5lets see, Deus Ex is in short, FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!
<Wrek> 5yeah that sounds about right
<Synros> so...day of sex is fan-fucking-tastic!?
<Synros> ok...
<Wrek> 5aye
<Wrek> 5but yeah Synros, definetly worth getting
<Synros> is there a trail or demo or something I can get first. Im very picky on video games
<Synros> like I bought Duke Nuke and returned it the same day I hated it
<DecapPony> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/23/demotivational-posters-balls-6/
<Synros> everyone said it was a great game, so I bought it
<Synros> bleh
<Dashite> Everyone said Duke Nukem was a great game?
<Dashite> Where?
<Synros> I honestly cannot remember
<Synros> some friends, and a couple websites said it was wortht he buy
<Thunder_Dash> I only played the demo, but yeah, DNF wasn't that great (though it's just about impossible to live up to 13 years of expectations anyways :P)
<Dashite> I had fun with it, but I wouldn't exactly call it a great game.
<Synros> the only game ive played and actually stuck to is WoW, and its been 6 years now
<DecapPony> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/21/demotivational-posters-socialising-2/
<Wrek> 5Synros: duke nukem is a poor example
<Wrek> 5becsuae it sucked balls
<Wrek> 5i can hook you up on some deus ex trailers/demos later
<Wrek> 5im sure that you'll love it
<Synros> i think OMFGCata is still doing a Deus Ex playthrough, I will go watch that too
<Wrek> 5just dont watch enough to spoil it for you
<Synros> yah on seconds thought I won't. I do that all the time
<Thunder_Dash> thinking about it, I think the only games I haven't spoiled for myself are the Ace Attorney games, Portal 2, and Hotel Dusk (which I haven't finished yet)
<Thunder_Dash> *spoiled the endings of before finishing
<DecapKing> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2011/08/18/demotivational-posters-or/
<Synros> I spoiled all of Cata.
<Synros> but Im going to try not to spoil the new Xpac this time
<Wrek> 5but yeah Synros ill hook you upi later
<Synros> kk wrek
<Thunder_Dash> even though the new Ace Attorney game is only in Japanese I'm trying not to spoil the ending for myself(I've played through most of it in japanese and from my extremely limited understanding I have a few guesses as to what might be going on, but still)
<Rodman> Nanananananananana BATMAN!

<UKbrony> Is there a reason why the chat log is underneath the stream and not to the right of it? just asking.
<prince-dari> It was pretty good because it spammed semi related stuff.
<AllisZero> Morning guys
<Rodman> UKBrony, you're using Firefox?
<prince-dari> But it failed because it spammed to the point of being DCed due to flooding, broke the message buffer I suppose.
<Daz> mornin', AllisZero
<Rodman> If so, just click outside the chat, press Ctrl and scroll out
<UKbrony> No,chrome
<Rodman> Should do the same
<FreezeFrame> Actually, Rodman, not that many bans.
<Daz> Rodman: this works in Chrome too, even if you're in the chat
<Rodman> Press ctrl, scroll out, it will realign itself as it zooms out
<UKbrony> Thanks!
<prince-dari> So where in the UK are you?
<Daz> also, UKbrony, top right you see the tool? click it, and you'll see 'ZOOM.'
<UKbrony> Wiltshire, are you in the UK?
<Rodman> FreezeFrame, yeah, but then again I'm easily impressed by numbers
<Daz> to the left and right of 'ZOOM' are + and -
<Rodman> Daz, I derp
<prince-dari> Eeyup, I'm in Reading.
<Daz> how did you derp, Rodman ?
<Rodman> No, I mean I tend to derp, so yeah
<Daz> i'm in Reading too! I also love in Running and in MountainClimbing, and my most favouritest thing is in Ponies
<Daz> xD
<UKbrony> I have to travel a LONG way to go Mountain climbing -_-
<SirSprinkles> Dari
<prince-dari> My Twilight must be one of the most traveled ponies out there.
<prince-dari> ?
<SirSprinkles> I have to head out, apparently I'm needed at home.
<SirSprinkles> Probably won't be back for the interviews today because of it...
<Daz> dari, wait till summer's over - my Fluttershy will travel from south spain, across spain, over sea, into England :P
<Daz> also, my RD if i get it later today
<prince-dari> Ok.
<SirSprinkles> I'll check the forums frequently though, so just make sure Sathi posts them there.
<Daz> aaaaand brb lunchtiemz :P
<prince-dari> Well, my Twilight will have traveled the highest most likely. :P
<MeteorVenture> i come back.. to- hey daz!
<Daz> soz lunch nao brb
<MeteorVenture> alright
<prince-dari> Yeah Sathi will, she seems to do pretty much all the interviews solo now. :/
<prince-dari> Everyone else has kind of left them to her.
<MeteorVenture> *sniff* the shut-in finally seeing the world
<SirSprinkles> Well, I'd like to sit in on them, but I NEVER have the time anymore... >>;
<prince-dari> Yeah,
<prince-dari> I understand.
<SirSprinkles> Not exactly a complicated process though, so I don't care too much.
<SirSprinkles> Alright, heading out.
<SirSprinkles> Talk later.
<prince-dari> Cya.
<UKbrony> It'll be intersting to sit through an american commercial, our adverts are so fucking repetitive!

<FreezeFrame> Ah.
<UKbrony> I'm not to keen on the figurines to be honest.
<MeteorVenture> funny thing is i was never into mecha.. but i REALLY liked gurren lagann
<prince-dari> INB4 teal
<RainBroDash> 10lol'd
<FreezeFrame> That's because Gurren Laggan isn't about the mecha
<RainBroDash> 10hai dariii:3
<FreezeFrame> It's about a world that runs on hot-bloodedness.
<Rodman> Oh hai RainBroDash
<MeteorVenture> yep that's what i figured

<prince-dari> I like it.
<RainBroDash> 10I literally couldn't give less of a shit about ponychan
<prince-dari> Yeah, but it's for advertising.
<prince-dari> He put the site link in a sticky.
<RainBroDash> 10yeah but I'm gonna be gone in 3 weeks anyway :L
<RainBroDash> 10nice
<MeteorVenture> lol sounds like yall got something against em
<RainBroDash> 10no meteorventure, I /personally/ don't like the place
<RainBroDash> 10nothing to do with bronystate or anything, just RBD
<MeteorVenture> alright.. what for if i may ask?
<Rodman> Any particular reason?
<RainBroDash> 10just meh
<Rodman> I find the place to be alright
<prince-dari> Lol, I don't like it either.
<RainBroDash> 10meh in its entirety
<prince-dari> It's full of drama.
<prince-dari> That's all I'm saying.
<RainBroDash> 10I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
<RainBroDash> 10it's not my scene
<Rodman> I like Ponychan, but really EqD, Bronystate and Ponibooru are my main soures for pony
<RainBroDash> 10and sooo many people take ponychan SOOO seriously
<Daz> >come back >Gurren XLR.
<MeteorVenture> ya i pretty much just think the place is alright.. i used to like it alot but i don't go there much anymore and don't find much to do there atm
*Daz brohoofs Rodman

<Daz> Thanks, man.
<Daz> My father WILL become a Brony ... :P
<Daz> um, i mean, uh, i-if it's alright with him
<Daz> did anyone see that splatterpaint wallpaper?
<Daz> for pinkiepie and twilight
<Rodman> I haven't
<Rodman> Link please?
<Daz> sure man
<Daz> http://www.deviantart.com/download/255688722/inky_sparkle_and_painty_pie_by_episkopi-d488aoi.png
<Daz> so uh, it's bloody fantastic, and it's also the wallpaper for my phone now =D.
<MeteorVenture> tbh these chatrooms USUALLY have the type of people i don't like in them.. it highly depends on the chatroom though and rarely i will find someone i like.. then again that's kinda like everywhere else ever
<Daz> see, androids have a scrolling background when you go from page 1 to 2 or 3, so i can have long wallpapers, it's awesome :P
<Daz> ...dunno if i explained myself
<Rodman> Pretty clear Daz
<Daz> yay~
<Rodman> And DAT WALLPAPER
<Rodman> I agree, its awesome
<Flutteryay> Well, a ton of people are complete asshats. You'll find then everywhere.
<MeteorVenture> ya basically.. but even nice people i sometimes don't like hanging around simply cause i don't have the same interests
<Daz> love 'n' tolerate
<Daz> also, i downloaded 'best of pony music vol. 1' gonna listen to it later :P
<MeteorVenture> it's rare to find a nice hardcore gamer christian that is exceptionally good at what they do.. it's rare enough to find a really good gamer lol
<MeteorVenture> who seriously is like that? oh wait.. me
<prince-dari> Meh, if all your friends are alike and have the same interests isn't that a bit boring?
<MeteorVenture> muahaahah
<prince-dari> It's interesting when people are different.
<Rodman> Hey Daz
<prince-dari> People good at different things, they like different things.

<Daz> My parents are christians, yet divorced, and up until a few weeks ago, i had lived in UK with my mum for about 12 years. now i've moved to Spain. I...don't know what I am. I am neither an atheist or a theist. Agnostic is too stereotypical thou. I'm still thinking about it : /
<MeteorVenture> it can be sure.. but i'd sure like to find someone that i could talk to about everything i think
<Daz> hmm
<Daz> Kamina stillbetter, but COop pretty rad
<Daz> MeteorVenture, ya can talk to me bro
<Daz> ^_^
<AllisZero> MeteorVenture: I have a friend who's exactly like you
<MeteorVenture> lol well it would appear so:P
<AllisZero> He's really christian, but loves gaming, animu, etc
<AllisZero> (And now that I converted him, MLP :p)
<prince-dari> Hm, my mum's a Christian, my dad hates all religion. XD

<Flutteryay> Somepony's trying to stir up drama in /pony/
<Daz> funny story, from school with a maths teacher, we had a derail on religion, and i'm normally one of the more discussing ones in class :P
<Flutteryay> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35777862.html#i35793859
<MeteorVenture> i think saying all religion is wrong is a pretty limited way of thinking.. what if my religion was that i spilled milk on someones shoe and then they didn't believe me cause it was a religion? then they start to feel their foot get wet
<Daz> me: Why do you hate religion, and not just leave it along? teacher: religion causes so many wars me: wha about the owther wars. him: ... money. me: ya not gonna use money either then xD xD. him: GTFO. and then i had a detention :3
<Synros> yah Meteor, but milk doesn't cause people to do questionable things
<MeteorVenture> lol srs
<MeteorVenture> well exactly! thanks for proving my point

<Synros> well I g2g do some things for a bit. "cash a week old work check..." I'll be back in a couple hours
<Daz> :D
<Daz> ok then Flutteryay i thought it would be you :D
<MeteorVenture> i am having trouble explaining my point lol
<Daz> bai bai Synros
<Flutteryay> oh you don't believe me? Well check my IP and that poster's IP then
<Daz> MeteorVenture, you explained it fine. 'pretty limited way fo thinking' says it all
<MeteorVenture> alright well thanks!
<Daz> Flutteryay, i mean i thought you would do something like that, but now I see it was not you :P
<MeteorVenture> and take care synros:D
<Flutteryay> k
<Daz> aaniways sorry MeteorVenture, i'm gonna watch a movie i haven't seen yet, so no music just yet : /. P'haps later today or something
<AllisZero> Sorry Daz, someone walked in to discuss something with me
<Flutteryay> I'd never do that. The mods here are awesome
<MeteorVenture> alright lol.. what's the movie?
<MeteorVenture> inception?
<Daz> also, RainBroDash / prince-dari So many new mods have been introduced. Just askin' if you know: Are there yet more mods still to be officially announced that are like undergoing something right now?
<Daz> MeteorVenture 'havne't seen before' :P. Inception was movie night, and even then i had seen it. nah, it's called '500 dayso f summer '
<MeteorVenture> orly? ok well i didn't watch that here.. i saw that recently though and it's awesome
<MeteorVenture> but never seen 500 DOS either
<Daz> hahaha, 500 DOS xD
<Daz> hope dari gets it "You would not believe your eyes, if five hundred MS-DOS, crashed in an office as I fell asleep"
<MeteorVenture> :P it wasn't actually intentional this time
<Daz> c'mon that's pretty funny :P
<Daz> still, good job, MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> thanks lol
<Daz> LAWL the movie is funny already
<AllisZero> If 500 MS-DOS crashed in an office the last thing you'd get is sleep
<Daz> ikr AllisZero
<Daz> haha
<RainBroDash> 10nice one, who's the little smart-ass who posted that on ponychan? trololo
<Daz> was it you?
<Daz> :P
<AllisZero> Alright, gonna be afk. Working on permissions on my shares
<Daz> also, i'm still asking: I just got an android phone, with market, etc. What's good stuff to get for it?
<Daz> (market being android's 'appstore')
<Daz> and another question: would you all rather have Rainbow Dash brushable, or 1/2/3 Blindbag ponies?
<MeteorVenture> why brush what's not broken?... wait
<Daz> HAHA oh man! MeteorVenture, I recommend this movie already. i'm not gonna talk about it anymore, as running commentaries are annoying, but it is one funny film, as reviews say it is :P
<Daz> i have fluttershy brushable, and today i'm either gonna get blindbags or rainbwodash brushable :3
<MeteorVenture> i have no toys ;_;
<Daz> do ya want any? would your parents be ok with it? are there any near you?
<MeteorVenture> i live in a trailer with no pony toys ;_;
<Daz> are there any near you thou? any shops you might pass?
<prince-dari> 14:43] <MeteorVenture> i think saying all religion is wrong is a pretty limited way of thinking.. what if my religion was that i spilled milk on someones shoe and then they didn't believe me cause it was a religion? then they start to feel their foot get wet
<prince-dari> [14:43] <Daz> me: Why do you hate religion, and not just leave it along? teacher: religion causes so many wars me: wha about the owther wars. him: ... money. me: ya not gonna use money either then xD xD. him: GTFO. and then i had a detention :3
<prince-dari> I don't blame my dad.
<MeteorVenture> lol ya.. my parents are divorced but my mom already knows i like all this.. she doesn't even mention it
<prince-dari> If I were him I'd probably feel the same.
<prince-dari> He's from Iran.
<prince-dari> Where religion is forced on you and if you don't like it you get executed.
<prince-dari> So...
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Daz> prince-dari, i'm not against or for any sides, i (i know i know a horrible habit) tend to side with opposite sides, just to provide conversation :P
<Daz> and, my point wasn't 'you must do relition' it was 'if you don't like it leave it alone, not hate it : /'
<Daz> religion *
<RainBroDash> 10it's pointless to even discuss religion
<prince-dari> My point is that he has reason to hate religion.
<Daz> oh, but it's so fun
<prince-dari> And I don't blame him.
<MeteorVenture> oh ya i wasn't attacking your dad or anything.. he could be a really cool dude for all i know.. i just had something to say about what he apparently thought
<Daz> what's his reason Dari?
<prince-dari> I told you?
<Daz> (again, just taking oposite sides to provide juicy conversation, tell me if ya want me to stop) He's from Iran, so he hates every single religion known to man?
<MeteorVenture> dat juiciness
<prince-dari> Well he hates that one in particular, but the rest he thinks are just bullshit anyway.
<Daz> waitwait we're discussing your dad. want to talk about you? or something
<Daz> hmm, that's fine. of course he has reason to hate that one, and if he thinks others are garbage (dat americanism), it's his opinion.
<Daz> Ya, i'm feeling lazy, i cba to carry on arguing today
<Daz> *yawn*
<MeteorVenture> aww.. i was gonna talk in depth about it with you too
<MeteorVenture> aha
<Daz> well, i can try and convince a small part of me to work xD
<Daz> ok, i'll try. shoot, MeteorVenture
<MeteorVenture> i was gonna wait for the movie to end though lol
<Daz> nah, dual screen, man!
<Daz> watching + headphones on right, bronystate chat on left
<MeteorVenture> and also i wasn't going to talk about it in the main chat since it just feels odd
<Daz> Well, whatever you want ^_^
<RainBroDash> 10again, religion is pointless to discuss :L thousands of years of false hope, idiocy and brainwashing, nty <3
<Daz> So...quite the CMC FiM episodes for tomorrow, huh
<RainBroDash> 10it's always CMC episodes XD
<Daz> yea, RainBroDash, but that's, like, your opinion, man
<Daz> and yay so much CMC fri
<RainBroDash> 10Daz my opinion is always fact ;D
<RainBroDash> 10such is life in my little world
<Daz> ;D ikr RainBroDash ikr
<Daz> contrary to popular belief, you ARE the center of the world. of the UNIVERSE. so (to quote a videogame) "The world ends with you. If you want to enjoy life, expand your world. You gotta push your horizons out as far as they'll go.!
<Daz> same character from vidya: "Enjoy the moment with all your might...whether it’s gloomy, whether it’s bright! " "Knowing it in your head doesn't mean much if you don't act on it. " "Enjoy every moment with all ya got. "
<RainBroDash> 10I still would like to know who tried to stir up shit on ponychan :<
<Daz> haha
<RainBroDash> 10Just so I can know /why/ they'd want to
<Daz> why.jpg
<MeteorVenture> who seriously uses the backspace button thing?
<MeteorVenture> to go back a page?
<RainBroDash> 10XD
<RainBroDash> 10I definitely have done before, but nowhere near as much as I have done accidentally
<RainBroDash> 10suxx doesn't it.
<MeteorVenture> exactly.. me too
<Daz> I do often, so when it happens by accident, i slap myself
<Daz> hey errybody: CTRL ALT UP
<Daz> now that you know that, press: CTRL ALT DOWN
<Daz> so i told ya how to reverse the DOWN thing. :P so try it out \o/
<RainBroDash> 10yfw I disabled that
<Daz> mfw indeedio
<MeteorVenture> i tried.. idk what up is
<MeteorVenture> ah i see
<prince-dari> Well, all the people in the room at the time were: prince-dari, ChanServ (I think it was him!), RainBroDash, AllisZero, Dashite, Daz, Dermathil, GGgala, MeteorVenture, Rodman, Steven_Magnet, UKbrony, VioletVanilla, WhatPayne.
<Daz> also, RainBroDash, mfw most at my school are technophobes. mfw two other guys who knewa bout that are total bros. mfw while teacher went out we turned EVERY SCREEN in a 30comps computer room, either left, right, or upsidedown. Teacher'sfacewhen.
<prince-dari> So, now use your Holmes skills to work it out RainBro!
<Daz> trololo ChanServ. and it wasn't me, i saw it there after flutteryay linked it
<prince-dari> XD
<WhatPayne> What's going on?
<prince-dari> Doesn't matter WhatPayne.
<RainBroDash> 10hmmmm well I think it was chanserv
<RainBroDash> 10I'm gonna go on a hunch
<prince-dari> ChanServ!
<prince-dari> You have been deemed guilty.
*Dermathil waves
<Daz> It was YOU http://www.dealspwn.com/writer/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/layton-point.jpg
<Dermathil> so, did anybody read the latest FO:E chapter?
<prince-dari> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH BEE-YETCH
<Daz> nah, Dermathil, still ain't read any
<Flutteryay> It wasn't me who posted it. I just linked it because I thought you'd like to know some anonymous pussy was talking shit behind your back
<RainBroDash> 10Dari love it
<Rodman> Daz, its not working :(
<Daz> Rodman: aww man. y u no good browser addons
<Daz> uh
<prince-dari> Flutteryay, I didn't include your name because I'm pretty sure you weren't even in the room when RainBro said it.
<Daz> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aSCM3tWAKX4/S_cOmuG2oYI/AAAAAAAAACE/Gj8jWW1L5yU/s1600/Layton_point.jpg
<Daz> this work Rodman ?
<Flutteryay> eeyup
*WhatPayne is like a deer caught in the headlights
<RainBroDash> 10and flutteryay I'll take your word on that ;) Also: I don't think I would refer to said person as an anonymous pussy, more just that they evidently don't understand what I said in the way I intended it ;)
<Flutteryay> All right.
<RainBroDash> 10pretty lulzy though
<Daz> Flutteryay was a total homie when i was stuck on prince-dari's puzzle. :3
<prince-dari> They did kind of take it out of context
<prince-dari> [14:30] <RainBroDash> I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
<prince-dari> [14:30] <RainBroDash> it's not my scene
<RainBroDash> 10I don't really care to be honest, context or not it was accurate to a point
<Daz> stereotypicalising image board users ;___; when there can be such diverse groups in a thread
<prince-dari> I hate imageboards.
<prince-dari> 'nuff said.
*WhatPayne still wonders what's going on
<RainBroDash> 10That's why I had to post personally, to make sure people knew why I said it
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBroDash> 10whatpayne nothing really, just a teency bit of drama
<RainBroDash> 10I'm surprised he didn't try and start a flame war
<WhatPayne> Ohh, ok. That explains it.
<Daz> DRAMATIC IRONY
<Daz> (that's one of the top 'memes' at my school oh man i'm laughing aloud now haha)
<RainBroDash> 10Flame wars are great for making people in a position like mine look bad :P You kinda get backed into a corner between defending your name and keeping the thread on topic

*Aristeo listens more
<VampirePrincess> i'm just.... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
<Aristeo> Which one makes you nervous?
<Aristeo> A Nintendo DS?
<AllisZero> Luna!
<Luna> 07good-day everyone
<AllisZero> Hai
<Luna> 07how are you?
<NewDCD> hey guys
<AllisZero> Hey NewDCD
<AllisZero> Doing alright, despite the lack of sleep
<Luna> 07want me to sing you a lullaby?
<Luna> 07bla?
<AllisZero> :( I would but not at work
<NewDCD> 9guys I made a proposition thread for an /rp/ concept
<NewDCD> 9check it out
<NewDCD> 9http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/res/36848474.html
<VampirePrincess> no but what if it is a.... i mean sure i've known him for 3 yrs, sure i can see it, but we havent knocked out all the kinks yet... like issues with the parental figures...
<VampirePrincess> eeep
<Aristeo> Parents are surprises that might be pocket sized?
<AllisZero> Hey NewDCD, remember you were trying to stress test the stream?
<VampirePrincess> lol no ari.
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9it's more urgent for us to try to stress test the IRC though
<AllisZero> Ah, then that might be out of my reach for now. Opening a few dozen tabs is easy to accomplish, but logging on to Irc might be more time consuming
<Luna> 07check http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35777862.html#i35777862
<AllisZero> The good news is, Irc takes much less bandwidth than the Stream so I won't need a 100 mbit Metro E
<NewDCD> 9AWESOME.
<Luna> 07I know right
<Wrek> Good afternoon fellow Bronies.
<MeteorVenture> >checks time >it's before noon
<MeteorVenture> good mroing mother in ar
<prince-dari> Well it's after noon here.
<prince-dari> :P
<Luna> 07Good-afernoon my name is luna
<AllisZero> Well Dari, you've pretty much been around since last night(for me)
*Luna suddenly killed the chat
<AllisZero> So I assume it's what, 8 in the evening there for you?
<AllisZero> oh whatevs
<prince-dari> No, 4pm.
*Wrek brohoofs prince-dari, timezone buddies xD
<AllisZero> Interesting

<AllisZero> We're... talking about your text right?
<Luna> 07,1 meow
<Wrek> if you wouldnt mind me bothering you again prince-dari, I would like to know, or be pointed in the direction, on how to talk in "my" colour through IRC
<Wrek> mIRC*
<MeteorVenture> aww lightning right when i am starting to do something
<ValtheJean> you can do that with control+k
<ValtheJean> or you can use a fancy script :P
<Wrek> yeah but it isnt permanent
<prince-dari> I gave Sathi the script, not sure if the pastebin is stil around.
<prince-dari> still*
<AllisZero> I feel like that everyday, Meteor
<AllisZero> Except instead of lightning it's "distressed user with computer problems"
<Luna> 07hmm
<Luna> 07I fucked up...
<prince-dari> ?
<AllisZero> I need a third monitor just for bronystate, goddamit
<MeteorVenture> lol geez

<NewDCD> 9awesome book
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ^

<ValtheJean> 2,14 sorry to hear that :(
<Dermathil> heh, Jean Valjean...
<Dermathil> a very nice fella
<Luna> 07Lol made by Val <3
<VioletVanilla> Les Miserables is a wonderful book and show
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a shame the movie was not nearly the same quality
<Dermathil> I had basically caught on the Jean Valjean part a few weeks back with the him being french thingy
<Luna> BLA
<VioletVanilla> I figured it out but didn't say anything .-.
<Wrek> luna
<Wrek> can has your script?

<ValtheJean> 2,14 do you use Maya or 3ds Max?
<RobotPinkie> Me too, though.... my 2D drawing technique sucks, unlike yours :P
<RobotPinkie> I don't work with it, though, obviously...
<AllisZero> That's awesome, Wrek
<AllisZero> I can't do 3D modeling to save my life however
<VioletVanilla> ATTENTION EVERYPONY. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT IS RAINBRODASH'S BIRTHDAY

<RobotPinkie> Wow, that looks good
<Pinkie_Pie> I want a Rainbow Dash cake.
<AllisZero> Oh god I hate my life lul
<Pinkie_Pie> @pony Best birthday cake theme
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Best birthday cake theme is 14Silver S15poon
<Pinkie_Pie> ...
<RobotPinkie> I need to practice my cake baking :(
<AllisZero> Just spent the last 10 minutes working on permissions ,forgot that if I rename the folder it breaks... everything forEVER
<RobotPinkie> ouch, AllisZero
<AllisZero> Yeah, little oversight on my part. No matter, I can do it again
<RobotPinkie> what kind of box?
<AllisZero> File server
<RobotPinkie> Unix based?
<AllisZero> Nah, Windows 2008 R2
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay... I feel for you. :P
<AllisZero> It's not that bad!
<AllisZero> I honestly didn't want to overhaul everything, just make things more manageable and faster
<RobotPinkie> lol I'm kinda kidding, I haven't really used Windows in 10 years
<AllisZero> I know, I know
<AllisZero> I do want to get into Linux, but oh the procrastination
<RobotPinkie> Eh, I hear Windows is pretty good nowadays
<flutterwhat> WINDOWS
<flutterwhat> is okay
<flutterwhat> but honestly
<flutterwhat> i would choose Mac over anything else
<flutterwhat> once
<flutterwhat> I made it my two week misson
<flutterwhat> to put Mac OS X on a PC
<RobotPinkie> There's a pony for everything on Mac!
<flutterwhat> and it was fucking hard as hell
<flutterwhat> yes
<flutterwhat> there is
<VioletVanilla> Really, if you do comparisons and the such, Linux is like. . . Windows XP capatibility wise with programs, but just Windows 7 in speed and workability.
<VioletVanilla> Flutterwhat.
<flutterwhat> windows is the BEST at gaming man
<VioletVanilla> Hoof, now.
<prince-dari> !op prince-dari
<flutterwhat> hoof
<flutterwhat> ?
<VioletVanilla> I giggle whenever somepony tells me that they bought a mac
*VioletVanilla brohoofs Flutterwhat
<flutterwhat> YES okay :D
<AllisZero> I can tell you with certainty, from working with Windows 7 since it came out, that it's much more stable than XP
<flutterwhat> I used to use Windows Vista Beta 1 back in the day
<AllisZero> Also much easier to actually get shit working
<flutterwhat> i LOVED aero's design
<VioletVanilla> Because Mac OSX on dual boot on my W7 is. . .
<flutterwhat> i like Vista's task bar design better the windows 7's however.
<VioletVanilla> les easy~
<AllisZero> Vista was bad and they should feel bad
<RobotPinkie> Linux is a lot more convenient for some developers, like me. It really depends on what you're doing, though. I'm not knocking any OS.
<flutterwhat> my current iMac was the best of it's line in 2006
<flutterwhat> my next iMac will be a beast
<VioletVanilla> @RobotPinkie: Exactly, my point was trying to compare Linux to another OS for relativity's sake.
<AllisZero> My assistant is a macfag
<flutterwhat> with 500gbs each for Windows 7 and Mac OS X
<AllisZero> But he's not a brainless fanboy like some of the others
<VioletVanilla> OH MY WORD
<VioletVanilla> WINDOWS TOOK TEN SECONDS TO LOG IN
<RobotPinkie> I'm kind of a fag for Open Source. :P
<VioletVanilla> IF I BOUGHT A MAC IT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
<VioletVanilla> OH MY WORD
<flutterwhat> YES
<flutterwhat> IT WOULD
<VioletVanilla> THIS WINDOWS MINIMIZED INSTEAD OF DISAPPEARED
<flutterwhat> BECAUSE MAC HARDWARE IS THE BEST HARDWARE
<VioletVanilla> MY MAC WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
<flutterwhat> and it would be even faster if you had a SSD installed
<flutterwhat> and YES IT WOULD
<RobotPinkie> lol yelling
<AllisZero> Haha
<AllisZero> It's because they usually speak in yells
<flutterwhat> im passionate about boot times. apparently.
<VioletVanilla> @Flutterwhat: I'm using real qorld examples of Macfags
<flutterwhat> <3
<RobotPinkie> Ubuntu boots in 10 seconds flat, for me.
<VioletVanilla> My Windows 7 boots in 6.7 seconds
<VioletVanilla> And that's with Derpy as my boot logo
<VioletVanilla> ;D
<prince-dari> If everyone could refresh their page.
<flutterwhat> Mac os X will always be 20% cooler
<prince-dari> On bronystate.
<RobotPinkie> Mandriva took almost a minute... what a derp distro
<prince-dari> With the F5 button.
<flutterwhat> k lol
<RobotPinkie> k, dari
<VioletVanilla> LISTEN TO DARI
<VioletVanilla> F5
<AllisZero> Alright
<VioletVanilla> No no no no no
<prince-dari> We be testin' stuffs.
<VioletVanilla> You got it wrong. ..
<ValtheJean> 2,14 is it just bronystate.co, or will dinkypage work too?
<prince-dari> Both.
<RobotPinkie> wai?
<VioletVanilla> ALT + F4 is refresh I believe <3
<ValtheJean> kk
<prince-dari> I edited both.
<RobotPinkie> Ah, lemme check .co.cc
<ValtheJean> 2,14 kk
<FlutterWhat> oh hai jayne
<AllisZero> Nothing changed so far
<AllisZero> Except everyone got kicked from the chat?
<prince-dari> By the way if you just click the nav bar on .co.cc that doesn't count as a refersh.
<prince-dari> refresh*
<RobotPinkie> I don't really see a difference?
<prince-dari> You have to be on the theatre page and press F5.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Well you'll see.
<RobotPinkie> It'd help if I knew what had changed.
<prince-dari> Oh stuff changed.
<prince-dari> The irc has changed.
*RobotPinkie refreshes again
<AllisZero> Yeah I can see
<AllisZero> bronyserv.co.cc now huh
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that means I should probably stop using mIRC then, huh? :P
<RobotPinkie> IRC has changed?
<prince-dari> Testing, yeah.
<FlutterWhat> neat!
<AllisZero> Want me to prepare the Orbital friendship cannon?
<prince-dari> Well that address is irc.bronyserv.co.cc

<Rodman> So what is being tested now Dari?
<RBD> testing
<prince-dari> Yeah, no one has registered nicks right now.
<prince-dari> So.
<mib_o7u8re> oh so this is the new one?
<prince-dari> Just bandwidth use.
<Rodman> Twenty peeps
<mib_o7u8re> so the other channel should be abandoned?
<Rodman> I think we need more
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Not 100% what we're doing yet though.
<mib_o7u8re> Ah okay.
<prince-dari> We may be switching here if it can take the strain.
<prince-dari> Or just a different bigger IRC server.
<prince-dari> That doesn't cap our room limit like epic-chat seems to be doing.
<AllisZero> I can prepare the orbital friendship cannon.
<prince-dari> Yeah, gunna use it for movie night.
<mib_o7u8re> IRC isn't all that traffic intensive.
<prince-dari> See what happens.
<prince-dari> It is when you have 4000+ people.
<prince-dari> :>
<AllisZero> Yeah I don't think I can simulate 4000 tabs
<prince-dari> XD
<mib_o7u8re> Well, that's true, but how do we test that? :P
<AllisZero> I can but that would involve a few hours of work that I don't think I can put forth :(
<prince-dari> We're using this server for movie night.
<RBD> hope it goes well :P
<prince-dari> Then I'll estimate from my bandwidth usage during that time how many people this server can take.
<RBD> we gonna register nicks and stuff?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<mib_o7u8re> I could write a script to open 4000 tabs, maybe... assuming the IRC client supports it.
<RBD> is it all set up already now?
<prince-dari> Services are up, yes.
<RBD> and mib_o7u8re mibbit only lets you have 4 I think
<prince-dari> We have memoserv, hostserv, botsev.
<prince-dari> ChanServ and NickServ of course.
<prince-dari> (plus OperServ, but you guys don't get to meet him ;)
<VioletVanilla> I wrote a script to flood IRC ;D
<mib_o7u8re> So we need 1000 people to test it in mibbit? :P
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> That's weird.

<Mibbit_sounds_like_Ribbit> Hard to test, in that case. :(

<RobotPinkamena> Hmm, wonder what I'm doing wrong...
<prince-dari> Weird.
<VioletVanilla> 0Nevermind. XD
<prince-dari> Services issue.
*prince-dari kills services.
*Dermathil is reading about how so many people of the Doctor Who production team/cast are ascended fanboys/fangirls
<ValtheJean> doesn't surprise me, considering how long that show has lasted
<RBD2> yap :P
<RobotPinkamena> What's really sad is that Douglas Adams is dead, I would've loved to see him write for the new Doctor Who. :(
<Dermathil> well all the actors for the doctor of the new series were born after the show began
<Dermathil> Well he's listed on the tvtropes page RP
<Dermathil> also, David Tennant is probably the biggest example of it.
<UKbrony> At what time does S2EP1 air on the 17th?
<RobotPinkamena> He wrote during the Tom Baker years.
<Dermathil> UKBrony, Saturday Morning cartoon
<Dermathil> so... hmmm.
*Dermathil starts to calculate what time it would result in the UK
<UKbrony> i need the specifics :D
<RobotPinkamena> How early in the morning?
<MeteorVenture> i'm omw to beating festers quest.. with save states.. keeping in tradition with the nes i will have to beat it without them later though.. so many chances to die.. none that i'm willing to take
<RobotPinkamena> GMT is EST+5
<UKbrony> eeyup
<Dermathil> I think it is supposed to be at around 9 AM EST
<AllisZero> Hmm
<Dermathil> so... 2PM?
<RobotPinkamena> Yeah. No official word on exact time?
<VioletVanilla> 0http://www.eeyup.com/
<VioletVanilla> 0<3
<MeteorVenture> this is quite fun:D
<AllisZero> Hahaha that's funny
<RobotPinkie> savestating is the way to play Fester's Quest, really
<Dermathil> I don't think there is, RP.
<RobotPinkamena> Well, then we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
<Dermathil> >mfw I notice RBD and Valthejean don't look like mods no more
<ValtheJean> liez
<RobotPinkamena> How long are we testing this, btw, prince-dari?
<Dermathil> where's your half-star then?
<prince-dari> Till after BMN at least.
<ValtheJean> it's hidden
<Dermathil> aaaaah
<RobotPinkamena> ah okay, so we should abandon the old one until then?
<prince-dari> Well anyone joining from now on will be in here.
<VioletVanilla> 0It's so empty. . . Are the other users unaware? o:
<prince-dari> Most of the users in the other channel are AFK.
<RobotPinkamena> Dinkypage still seems to be on the other IRC
<prince-dari> It's not.
<AllisZero> Should do a +m and just leave a message
<AllisZero> For anyone who comes back from ay eff kay
<RobotPinkamena> I think that's a good plan
<Rodman> You know which games do require alot of savestating?
<Rodman> The Gheb FE hacks
<Rodman> Holy crap, are they hard
<RobotPinkamena> There are still people talking in there :P
<prince-dari> Should just akick with refresh the page - new server
<prince-dari> Well, akick is something different.
<prince-dari> But meh.
<prince-dari> I'll call it akick anyway.
<RobotPinkamena> Whatever you think is right :P
<AllisZero> akick and not aboot?
<Wrek> 06hmm
<RobotPinkamena> He's from the UK, not Canada :P

<RobotPinkie> I'm still in this room, weird...
<Dermathil> yeah
<AllisZero> So am I
<AllisZero> so special

<VioletVanilla> 0Forever alone~
<prince-dari> Gah.
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> this is derptastic
<VioletVanilla> 0I'm kind of scared too, because I know that a couple of people PMing me are now like . . .
<VioletVanilla> 0In the Twilight Zone
<VioletVanilla> 0XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so are we still using this channel?
<WhatPayne> Hey what's rebooting?
<VioletVanilla> 0Funny story commence. The Twilight Zone is an actual place on the internet, it's not a dimension of sight, nor sound, but more rather a place of absolute mystery. When a game desyncs, but continues going and the ghost of the other user is still playing. When a video buffers endlessly but is somehow playing in another window.
<VioletVanilla> 0You've stepped across the line, and have entered. . .
<WhatPayne> Changing irc? What's going on?
<VioletVanilla> 0The Twilight Zone.
<RobotPinkie> The Derpy Zone would be much stranger, I feel.
<ViolentVanilla> (:
<VioletVanilla> 0;D
<VioletVanilla> 0Right you are!
<RobotPinkie> Though I once kept playing WoW for minutes before the game noticed I was disconnected....
<VioletVanilla> 0This is what I speak of. . .
<VioletVanilla> 0>D
<RobotPinkie> It was very creepy. Everything was frozen in place, and I just ran around and looked at stuff that I wasn't supposed to be able to get near.
<VioletVanilla> 0It is very odd sometimes. . .
<VioletVanilla> 0By the way, I see that it's just you and I. . .
<VioletVanilla> 0o:
<RobotPinkie> Really? :O
<VioletVanilla> 0And Dari is fixing all of the leaks in the system
<RobotPinkie> ...how do I get back to the real world?
<VioletVanilla> 0and I THINK Dermathil might have been ponynapped. . .
<VioletVanilla> 0I don't know. . .
<Dermathil> STILL HERE, trying to fix my flipping problem
<RobotPinkie> let me clear cache and restart the browser...
<RobotPinkie> brb
<RobotPinkie> ...though hopefully in the right room
<VioletVanilla> 0D: I didn't mean to frustrate you more Dermathil
<VioletVanilla> 0I was just kidding~ ;3
<VioletVanilla> 0What's wrong?
<VioletVanilla> 0And okay RobotPinkie~
<VioletVanilla> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12VioletVanilla is 15Rari6ty
<VioletVanilla> Gently pleeeaaaassseee~
<Violet_Vanilla> That was your problem? o:
<Flutteryay> will a mod gonna help me? :P
<prince-dari> lulz
<VioletVanilla> What's up? o:
<Flutteryay> Are we changing rooms or something?
<ValtheJean> 2,14we're trying to sort this all out at the moment, we'll let you know when there's something to report
<VioletVanilla> 0XD
<VioletVanilla> 0YOU KICKED HIM
<VioletVanilla> 0IN THE BALLS
<VioletVanilla> 0IF HE HAD ANY
<VioletVanilla> 0ololololol
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<prince-dari> Mwuahahahaha
<Flutteryay> So I was playing Winter Wrap Up on guitar earlier and my brother recognized it.
<RobotPinkie> Oh cool, I think I'm finally back
<Flutteryay> So, that means I have infected him with a dangerous war worm
<RobotPinkie> Nice job, Flutteryay
<Flutteryay> *ear worem
<Flutteryay> *WORM
<Flutteryay> I can't type, even though I am very good at spelling...
<RobotPinkie> I was humming "Proud to be a Brony" all day at work.

*Dermathil decides to leave for class.
<Dermathil> Cyall!
<Dermathil> (still 1 hours before it begins but I got stuff to verify)
<RobotPinkie> I can type and spell fairly well, but I need to work on my grammar.
<RobotPinkie> Sometimes some weird Swedish grammar sneaks in. I am very disappoint :(
<RobotPinkie> ...I think my grammar just killed the entire chat.
<Luna> 07Pinkie!
<Luna> 07*hugs*
*RobotPinkie hugs Luna
<Luna> 07yay
<RobotPinkie> Yay, hi Luna!
<Luna> 07how are you?
<Luna> 07looking forward to 4 eps of house?
<Pinkie_Pie> I didnt know grammar could kill a chatroom.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I would be looking forward to house...if I didn't have classes during them :(
<RobotPinkie> I finally completely outed myself as a brony to everyone I know.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 how'd it go?
<RobotPinkie> and yes, I am very much looking forward to that, especially since I fell asleep during the 3rd episode last night
<Luna> 07today we wrap season 2 up :)
*ValtheJean 2,14 cries
<RobotPinkie> lol well so far no one's called me any names, at least
<Luna> 07poor val
<Flutteryay> Season wrap u[p, Season wrap up~~~
<Luna> 07i'll save the episodes for you
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol grats pinkie, you're a step above me ;)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Sathi, all my <3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 all of it
<madponyking> Hi guys! Whats goin on?
<RobotPinkie> I doubt everyone's seen it thus far, but we'll see in... about 5 hours?
<Luna> 07Season wrap-up, Season wrap-up
<ValtheJean> 2,14 let's finish our medical cheer
<Luna> 07House + IT crowd today and maybe 1 ep of a random cartoon
<RobotPinkie> 'cause tomorrow Lupus is heeeeere
<madponyking> seriously?
<RobotPinkie> Oh it's "for"
<RobotPinkie> hey madponyking
<madponyking> why do we only watch IT crowd and house?
<Luna> 07cause House is awesome
<RobotPinkie> because... they're awesome shows. :P
<madponyking> Oh. I see
<madponyking> they are indeed.
<RobotPinkie> pretty sure there's some wiggle room in what else Luna streams, though
<madponyking> But whys should we stick with only them?
<Luna> 07people like House
<Luna> 07I like House
<Luna> 07= win
<madponyking> damn straight!
<Luna> 07People like IT crowd
<RobotPinkie> I'd vote for some more Freakazoid, too :3
<Luna> 07I like IT crowd = double win
<ValtheJean> 2,14 You can't argue with that logic :P
<madponyking> so when do we watch it?
<WhatPayne> Once all the IT crowd has been gone through, we could maybe continue with Spaced, like I suggested yesterday?
<Luna> 07No Spaced available.. I looked for it today
<RobotPinkie> about an hour from now, I think. Luna would know better than me, though.
<Luna> 07any other suggestions?
<madponyking> how about Heroes?
<Luna> 07I was thinking about Bones, NCIS or CSI
<WhatPayne> Damn. It's available through the "other" method.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 G3! *Trollface*
<Luna> 07lol
<RobotPinkie> NO!
<RobotPinkie> G3.5 :3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 RobotPinkie: Win
<madponyking> why not just G4?
<RobotPinkie> trolololo
<WhatPayne> Well the voice of pinkie pie is in the G3.5 somewhere
<RobotPinkie> No G4 eps outside BMN... until S2, anyway
<VioletVanilla> 0And then there were two. . .
<madponyking> awww...
<VioletVanilla> 0how's it going Prince-Dari? Getting things working?
<prince-dari> It's gunna take a while.
<RobotPinkie> sometimes people set up synchtube rooms though, not sure if that's frowned upon or something
<ValtheJean> 2,14 LICD has become so much better now that larz admitted to being a brony :P
<RobotPinkie> LICD?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Least I Could Do
<WhatPayne> Anywho, there is that other British show I have not seen, Black Books.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wubs Bwack Boks! /)^3^(\
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<madponyking> Do the things we watch have a schedule or something so that I dont miss anything?
<CharlesAppleJackson> shit man. fucking time zones, how do they work?
<Luna> 07I normally start my streaming around 3:30 PM Eastern
<Luna> 0714 mins CaJ
<CharlesAppleJackson> in other words, 2 hours?
<VioletVanilla> 0Understood <3 Thank you for doing all that you do for BronyState! You don't get enough recognition or thanks~
<Luna> 07yes
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh that cod.
<CharlesAppleJackson> >that
<prince-dari> Haha, thank you. :)
<madponyking> Oh
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh thank cod*
<RobotPinkie> I've been listening to brony music all day. So. Awesome.
<WhatPayne> But hey, got my Luna t-shirt done. Now I can proudly display my Bronydom in open.
<WhatPayne> yay
<CharlesAppleJackson> I was literally laying in bed last night going to sleep, had my alarm set for 1:00 my time. Then I was like 'wait... doesn't BMN start at 7, but I always get there at 6? OHSHITOHSHITOHSHIT"
<Flutteryay> Four months of speculation, and awesome fan works too. We've kept our fandom busy with the Brony things we do. But out patience has been running out and we can't grow in this cold. And even though I love season 1, the wait is getting old...
<RobotPinkie> Nice, WhatPayne!
<VioletVanilla> I want to see this shirt WhatPayne :3
<WhatPayne> one sec
<RobotPinkie> Me too, or at least the image it's based on :3
<WhatPayne> http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9545/img1265h.jpg
<CharlesAppleJackson> that's one of the better Winter Wrap Up Parodies I've heard
<CharlesAppleJackson> because seriously they all suck
<WhatPayne> Hope the link works
<Flutteryay> Thanks! I made that myself.
<CharlesAppleJackson> DAT SHIRT
<RobotPinkie> Oooooh, nice
<WhatPayne> Made the design myself influenced by MegaSweets wallpapers
<VioletVanilla> <3
<VioletVanilla> It's beautiful~
<WhatPayne> Why thank you.
<VioletVanilla> What'd you use on the shirt to get it that way?
<VioletVanilla> 0No problem! ^.^
<WhatPayne> Um It was inkjetprinter iron on transfer paper for black fabric
<Flutteryay> it's really great
<Luna> 07So guys
<madponyking> ?
<Luna> 07NCIS / CSI / Bones or something else?
<RobotPinkie> I like CSI...
<WhatPayne> Which CSI?
<VioletVanilla> CSI: MIAMI
<RobotPinkie> CSI Miami if we want a lulzy chat room :P
<WhatPayne> I'd go with Miami too.
<RobotPinkie> regular CSI is much better, but not nearly as funny, so I'd vote Miami too
*Luna is checking
<madponyking> miami sounds good to me...
<madponyking> But this is only after we run out of IT crowd right?
<RobotPinkie> This is such an awesome song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s

<Luna> 07Bah no Miami available and only 2 eps of the original
<RobotPinkie> Aw. CSY: New York then?
<RobotPinkie> CSI, lol
<Luna> 07trying the "other"way
<RobotPinkie> Crime Scene Yngwiemalmsteengations
<madponyking> Why csi? why not Law & Order?
<CharlesAppleJackson> it looks like Miami...
<Luna> 07Alright guys back in a bit
<CharlesAppleJackson> ...
<CharlesAppleJackson> ah got nothin
<RobotPinkie> I wouldn't mind Law & Order, either, really...
<VioletVanilla> Do whichever you need Luna~
<RobotPinkie> ...also I love IT Crowd, so...
<CharlesAppleJackson> yeah, whatever your heart's all up ins
<Luna> 07CAJ PM

<CharlesAppleJackson> Space Jam and Mulan
<Luna> 07How many movienights have you attended so far?
<RobotPinkie> lolol that's an awesome video right there
<CharlesAppleJackson> cod, I don't think I'd know without a list or something... it's been a bunch though
<madponyking> HEY! I just had an awesome idea!
<madponyking> Why dont we watch Adventure Time?!
<Choveck> whats that?
<CharlesAppleJackson> I
<Luna> 07Take a wild guess?
<madponyking> A tv show suposedly for kids like my little pony.
<CharlesAppleJackson> I would estimate at least like... ten? maybe
<RobotPinkie> That is an idea I can get behind
<madponyking> Its epicly awesome!
<Luna> 07Alright
<RobotPinkie> Adventure Time is awesome
<Choveck> lol
<Luna> 07What role did you apply for?
<VioletVanilla> I have all episodes.
<VioletVanilla> If I could stream I would.
<Choveck> yeah give it a go
<VioletVanilla> but don't tell Dari
<VioletVanilla> He hates it c.c
<CharlesAppleJackson> moderator
<prince-dari> >_>
<madponyking> seriously?
<prince-dari> Because it sucks.
<Luna> 07Do you have any experience with moderating?
<madponyking> awww man
<VioletVanilla> D:
<VioletVanilla> DON'T KILL ME DARI
<VioletVanilla> SPARE ME
<prince-dari> It's actually pretty creepy to be honest. :P
<VioletVanilla> Or at least my kitten. . .
<prince-dari> Nah, I just kill RainBro.
<prince-dari> OOH KITTENS
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh okay
<prince-dari> TASTY!
<CharlesAppleJackson> yes sir, I modded a video game stream for TomBobBlender on uStream
<prince-dari> Omnomnomnomnom
<madponyking> Creepy?
<madponyking> NOOOO!
<RobotPinkie> Well I guess that idea's shot down then. :P
<Luna> 07How many viewers did the show have?
<madponyking> awww...
<Luna> 07I'll ignore the yes sir part for now....
<Choveck> what should i do with my time then?
<prince-dari> I streamed a couple episodes by request one time.
<madponyking> and what happened?
<prince-dari> Half the people found it weird / creepy like me and half liked it.
<CharlesAppleJackson> hmm... let me think
<madponyking> lol not even MLP FIM is loved by all!
<WhatPayne> Is it made for TV or internet spawn thing-y?
<Luna> 07Sure
<madponyking> For tv
<VioletVanilla> It originated in the US on TV. . .
<WhatPayne> oh ok
<RobotPinkie> Well, FiM is loved by everyone here, though :P
<madponyking> Sure is!
<VioletVanilla> You don't even know . . .
<RobotPinkie> ...except Steven_Magnet
<VioletVanilla> FiM is EVERYTHING here

<RobotPinkie> @awesomemeter Friendship is Magic
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Friendship is Magic is 70% awesome. (1554)
<RobotPinkie> See? That's just heresy.
<CharlesAppleJackson> IIRC it was anywhere between 50-200 viewers...? a pretty rough estimate, but it should be pretty accurate
<VioletVanilla> @pony The pony that is posing as Steven_Magnet to get closer to RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that is posing as Steven_Magnet to get closer to RobotPinkie is 7Applej8ack
<WhatPayne> In Finland FIM isn't that big yet...
<CharlesAppleJackson> depending on the game, I guess
<RobotPinkie> Oooh, nice.

<RobotPinkie> Sweden is to the right of Norway :P
<Wrek> 06not below
<Luna> 07In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Choveck> well in france nobody knows about it
<Luna> 07As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<Luna> 07np
<DecapKing> OMG
<VioletVanilla> I beg to differ RP
<DecapKing> WHERE IS THE STREAM?!?!?!??!?!?!?!
<VioletVanilla> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png/276px-Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png
<WhatPayne> I'd say its more popular in France tho.
<Luna> 07starting in 90 mind
<Luna> 07mins*
<Choveck> well i dont really know
<DecapKing> well i knew that sweden was next to Russia
<VioletVanilla> It's popular in France, Germany, and UK
<RobotPinkie> Huh, VioletVanilla? That's a very tiny part of Norway that's above Sweden...
<DecapKing> cause i know alot about the motherland
<Choveck> just a fact that they cant speak english for shit here
<VioletVanilla> The stream is IN Russia
<CharlesAppleJackson> ... shit, man
<DecapKing> <- from Russia
<WhatPayne> My knowlege of FIM's popularity depends on EqD news.
<VioletVanilla> Well yes, you're right RP
<Luna> 07We like to get to know you a bit better
<VioletVanilla> it kind of spoons Sweden
<Choveck> so they wouldnt know about mlp unless it is in french
<VioletVanilla> <3
<ValtheJean> I know I shouldn't...but that made me Lol
<Wrek> 06<3
<CharlesAppleJackson> like... skills as a mod or just... skills
<VioletVanilla> INCOMING HETALIA
<Luna> 07:P
<Luna> 07the shit, man thing?
<VioletVanilla> Become one with Russia.
<Luna> 07Skills in general we can zoom in on your mod skills later
<prince-dari> Lolwut
<ValtheJean> yeah
<WhatPayne> Doesn't everyone in internet almost have to be able to speak english?
<prince-dari> That doesn't seem the best thing to say in an interview.
<VioletVanilla> ^ Yes
<DecapKing> its taught in most school systems in the world
<VioletVanilla> and no
<DecapKing> weel
<DecapKing> *well
<CharlesAppleJackson> well, I like to think I'm okay at video games, I can usually beat casuals, but the more hardcore will usually stomp me flat
<DecapKing> a good amount
<RobotPinkie> Russia always gets their asses kicked by the Finns :P
<Luna> 07dat answer
<madponyking> You dont HAVE to. But it helps
<VioletVanilla> DK I wasn't saying no to your reply XD
<Wrek> 06dat answer indeed
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> Wut
<DecapKing> i know
<prince-dari> A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
<VioletVanilla> Oh okay
<VioletVanilla> Let's put it this way. . .
<Wrek> 06sho dari, you have a config to mkae :P
<VioletVanilla> If you're on the internet
<prince-dari> XD
<VioletVanilla> and you're talking to someone
<Luna> 07Any other skills you have?
<VioletVanilla> Type english unless otherwise noted
<CharlesAppleJackson> other than that, I like to sing, although I rarely do it in front of anyone else, and I'm not necissarily that good
<VioletVanilla> Learned that the first time. . .
<Choveck> most people i know in france just have an inability to learn english
<Wrek> 06^
*VioletVanilla begins rambling in German.
<DecapKing> it isnt really needed, you can just translate most things
<WhatPayne> Exactly, I had no idea Violet you were (I suppose) Finnish until now.
<CharlesAppleJackson> but I am frequently singing along to things I listen to, sometimes to the dismay of others
<DecapKing> Violet is Finnish?
<VioletVanilla> I'm Deutsch WP XD;
<Luna> 07If we would ask a friend of yours to describe you, what would he / she say?
<WhatPayne> Wait, what?
<DecapKing> so your German?
<VioletVanilla> I have friends in Finland
<VioletVanilla> and family that moved there
<VioletVanilla> but I was born in Austria
*Wrek begins rambling in swedish, SKÅL!
<DecapKing> do you live in Berlin?
<WhatPayne> Oh ok.
<madponyking> who here is actualy from the USA? just out of curiosity...
<CharlesAppleJackson> depends on who you ask... the first guy who comes to mind would probably call me an asshole -.-
<WhatPayne> I sorta thought only Finnish would have several Finnish friends.
<VioletVanilla> and then moved here to Dresden, Saxony, Germany
<Luna> 07dat answer
<RobotPinkie> Waarom moet ik Engels spreken? :(
<ValtheJean> I think that's going to be the slogan of this interview :P
<DecapKing> im from Russia, but i dont know any Russian
<DecapKing> but i live in the US
<prince-dari> Wow.
<ValtheJean> "dat answer"
<Luna> 07How so?
<madponyking> So thats a "No one" ?
<WhatPayne> I visited Berlin last year. That city is awesome!
*Luna just found CSI miama S1
<RobotPinkie> I guess only Luna would get that, lolz
<Luna> 07Miami*
<DecapKing> Y U NO STREAM ARCHER?
<CharlesAppleJackson> mostly because I like to be sarcastic, I guess
<VioletVanilla> Because my parents thought it'd be beneficial if I ever go anywhere outside of Europe
<Wrek> 06So far i feel hesitant
<VioletVanilla> Or IN Europe even .~.
<Luna> 07If you needed to describe yourself in 3 words what would they be?
<DecapKing> go to RUssia
<CharlesAppleJackson> gaming internet lurker
<WhatPayne> Violet ever been in Finland yourself?
<Luna> 07oh lol...
<Wrek> 06:|
<ValtheJean> shall I make a "dat answer" meme now? :P
<VioletVanilla> I work as a secretary and during my interview English was one of the key reasons I got the job.
<Luna> 07sure
<Luna> 07What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<RobotPinkie> Luna doesn't approve of my dutch... probably because I'm 10 years out of practise. :(
<Wrek> 06where was dat answer, when the interview took place?
<ValtheJean> win wrek, just win :P
<VioletVanilla> One of the main functions I do is translate from German to English and English to German
<Wrek> 06thanks, i do my best ^^
<madponyking> dose it pay well?
<prince-dari> Wrek?
<CharlesAppleJackson> maybe asking the guys who run those Facebook Bronies pages to advertise or something
<Luna> 07Any other ideas?
<CharlesAppleJackson> they have two pages with like 5,000 and 8,000 likes
<prince-dari> That's a bit personal...
<CharlesAppleJackson> not unless you haven't been on EqD already
<RobotPinkie> English translators get really bad pay here, because so many people speak it well.
<DecapKing> Hai Dari, WHERE IS THE STREAM?!??!?!?!?!
<Luna> 07Well, she doesn't have to answer
<Luna> 07it's her personal choice
<CharlesAppleJackson> maybe an advert in celestia radio
<madponyking> yep
<madponyking> im just curious
<prince-dari> I'm setting shit up DecapKing. :P
<VioletVanilla> In a word, yes.
<CharlesAppleJackson> as for improvements, I think it's pretty good already... not sure if I could make it any better
<prince-dari> Luna: Yeah, but it's just one of those things you don't ask, like a woman's age. :P
<prince-dari> Well, here it is anyway.
<RobotPinkie> Germans aren't usually very good at English, no offence :P
<prince-dari> Though I live in the civil land of Britainland.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but we can ask your age though Dari :P
<WhatPayne> Or weight
<DecapKing> Dari where you busy looting?
<Luna> 07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<madponyking> oh shit! I gotta go! Bye guys! Have a nice stream!
<ValtheJean> inb4 dat answer :P
<RobotPinkie> bai madponyking
<WhatPayne> cya
<Wrek> 06yes prince-dari my dear?
<Luna> 07those answers
<VioletVanilla> Oh I agree RobotPinkie
<prince-dari> Nevermind, was just trying to get your attention for the file.
<DecapKing> basically
<RobotPinkie> I think it's that in Germany everything gets dubbed, doesn't it?
<CharlesAppleJackson> well, the reasons are layered, but when it really comes down to it, you guys have exposed me to movies I would have never seen before, and you're also pretty awesome people, so I wanna help in any way I can
<Luna> 07I just hate the german movie syncing.. or tv shows
<Luna> 07so much fail...
<RobotPinkie> In Sweden only children's shows/movies get dubbed.
<Wrek> 06ok the file's in the folder
<WhatPayne> ^Same in Finland
<Luna> 07Any other motivations?
<prince-dari> What, because nearly all the adults speak English?
<VioletVanilla> Meine Mutter ist Englisch-Lehrerin
<RobotPinkie> and same in Norway, btw.
<Wrek> 06yes prince-dari
<WhatPayne> Oshit Conan's on TV
<Wrek> 06the majority is very fluetn in english, for sweden that is
<RobotPinkie> Well movies are subtitled, prince-dari, but virtually everyone speaks English fairly well
<VioletVanilla> ;A;
<WhatPayne> ^Same
<Luna> 07Dari are you streaming tonight?
<CharlesAppleJackson> ok so yeah, the colored text is nice, but that's just like... a sub reason
<RobotPinkie> lol even children's movies have both dubbed and subtitled versions in the theatres.
<prince-dari> Depends on how much stuff I have to do.
<CharlesAppleJackson> not even a real reason, just a perk, I guess
<prince-dari> I usually stream whenever you finish.
<prince-dari> And somtimes before you start.
<prince-dari> sometimes*
<WhatPayne> Except Finns can't pronounce properly anything
<Wrek> 06*dat asnwer*
<Luna> 07Ah ok I was planning to go live in 90 mins
<WhatPayne> In English that is
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, colors are pretty sexy ;)
<RobotPinkie> They can pronounce Swedish pretty well, WhatPayne, at least in Helsinki :P
<Luna> 07Do you have any previous IRC experience?
<prince-dari> Sprinkles was so desperate for his colour. XD
<RobotPinkie> oh lol, fraction of a second too late of me.
<ValtheJean> lol
<prince-dari> Ahh, the good old days.
<CharlesAppleJackson> yeah, the other chat I modded was on ustream, which uses IRC
<prince-dari> Of earlier this year.
<prince-dari> XD
<RobotPinkie> Man, Helsinki is such a nice city. I can't wait to go back sometime.
<WhatPayne> Really? I kinda had the idea our Swedish is like unintelligible to Swedish.
<CharlesAppleJackson> I didn't use the commands that often as a mod though, because I usually just right clicked
<RobotPinkie> Not really, WhatPayne, I could talk to every single Finn I met in Helsinki
<Luna> 07At least he's honest
<RobotPinkie> You live there?
<WhatPayne> That's nice. Goes to show how you souldn't belive everything people say.
<WhatPayne> Yes, I live in Helsinki.
<Luna> 07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
<Luna> 07I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
<CharlesAppleJackson> :V
<Luna> 07Tell me when your ready
<WhatPayne> I'm sorry to say my Swedish is so bad I would not attempt to speak it to anyone.
<RobotPinkie> Cool, me and my girlfriend love the city. We might go back next year.
<Wrek> 06agreed
<CharlesAppleJackson> As the great pony #7 once said
<WhatPayne> That's nice, Hope you have good time.
<CharlesAppleJackson> LET's DO THIS
<Apokalipse> Hello Bronystate
<WhatPayne> Hellew
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh cod that was stupid
<Wrek> 06actualyl going there by shuttle in a month or so to visit a fellow brony
<RobotPinkie> If you're still around #BronyState then I could buy you a beer, WhatPayne :P
<Luna> 07First image:
<Luna> 07http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/b0888f66a008c11f490c79ec5656059f/26664%20-%20artist%3Aopalwhisker%20Cupcakes%20dexterous_hooves%20dress%20fanfic%20pinkie_pie.png
<RobotPinkie> hey Apokalipse
<WhatPayne> That would be nice, and I probably will.
<CharlesAppleJackson> it is cupcake related, but nothing too explicit, so probably a warning
<RobotPinkie> It's awesome meeting other bronies... I hear, anyway. :P
<WhatPayne> FYI ever see another person going with "WhatPayne" then it's most likely me.
<VioletVanilla> I'm not sure if I replied to you WhatPayne, but yes I have been to visit there several times.
<Luna> 07Second image:
<Luna> 07http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png
<VioletVanilla> Last time I visited I wrote an anthem on the piano for my friend.
<Wrek> 06mfw i dont know what cupcakes is
<WhatPayne> Yes I read that. That's really nice. It's just I'm finnish and we don't get that kinds of compliments that often.
<ValtheJean> you don't want to
<RobotPinkie> I go by RobotPika/RobotPinkie everywhere online now.
<ValtheJean> also http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
<CharlesAppleJackson> that would probably warrant a kick
<Wrek> 06nice val
<ValtheJean> ty :P
<Wrek> 06and thank you for getting me to want to know
<Wrek> 06sily yo
<ValtheJean> lol
<Luna> 07:D
<ValtheJean> I could go into detail if you wanted, but you really are better off not knowing
<Luna> 07Third image:
<Luna> 07http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
<WhatPayne> That makes it easier to go around, but only if the name is such that no-one else might not use.
<RobotPinkie> except Google+ and Facebook, for obvious reasons :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ohai octavia
<Apokalipse> Hi Škoda
<Wrek> 06val
<Wrek> 06now.
<ValtheJean> lol, I'll pm it to you
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, WhatPayne, I just figured the pika was an obscure enough animal that not many people would connect it with robots :P
<CharlesAppleJackson> not as bad as the second one I guess, because they're not literally on top of each other, but still at the very least, a warning
<Octavia> 14Hey guys
<DecapKing> Hai Octavia
<VioletVanilla> I'm in love with Pika, but you've probably never herd of it
<Apokalipse> I saw two Škoda Octavias today
<CharlesAppleJackson> probably a kick though because actual kissing is involved
<Apokalipse> :p
<VioletVanilla> Hi Octavia~ :3
<WhatPayne> I've been using my nick for about an decade now. It's like my other name.
<RobotPinkie> ohay Octavia!
<Luna> 07>mfw a kick for the 3rd picture
<Wrek> 06agreed
<Wrek> 06a first isnt it?
<WhatPayne> Oh hi Octavia.
<Flutteryay> Hi Tavi
<Octavia> lol
<Luna> 07Fourth and final image:
<Luna> 07http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg

<Octavia> 14Heyyas :P
<Wrek> 06aye, 404'd
<VioletVanilla> @WhatPayne: That's nice to hear. I have been using Violet in various combination for years now.
<CharlesAppleJackson> is it supposed to be 404'd
<DecapKing> Fine then, Hai Octi
<Luna> 07Fourth image is down
<Luna> 07One sec
<VioletVanilla> DEM OCTAVES
<VioletVanilla> <3
<WhatPayne> Nice
<RobotPinkie> Been using mine for maybe 3-4 years, not sure. Before that I went by different permutations of robot/mechanical and wolf, but that proved... uh... to be too popular. :P
<ValtheJean> if you wanted, I could upload all four images to my photobucket, that way the links will stay forever
<Luna> 07please do
<ValtheJean> on it
<Luna> 07but we need a new nr 4
<Wrek> 06@drinkablemeter DrPepper
<Steven_Magnet> 6 DrPepper is 98% drinkable. (1555)
<WhatPayne> I wonder if in future the nic will become like a thing like your own name...
<DecapKing> ive been using this for 3 years
<ValtheJean> I'll see if I can find that as well
<VioletVanilla> @drinkablemeter RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie is 32% drinkable. (1556)
<DecapKing> ^ that is true Steven
<RobotPinkie> I am currently drinking Dr Pepper, Wrek. :P
*Wrek brohoofs RobotPinkie
<WhatPayne> (oh god my english is derp)
*Luna has no idea where to look for such material
<RobotPinkie> aw, I thought I had more fluids in me than that :(
<VioletVanilla> What is Dr, Pepper?
*RobotPinkie brohoofs Wrek
<ValtheJean> my dear sweet sathi, never lose that innocence
<DecapKing> I am also drinking Dr. Peper
<DecapKing> *pepper
<Luna> 07:)
<Luna> 07;)
<Octavia> 14:P
<RobotPinkie> Dr Pepper is a soft drink that is awesome, VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> They don't sell that here. . . v.v
<DecapKing> Violet, Dr. Pepper is a soft drink of the gods
<Apokalipse> I never drank Dr. Pepper
<Luna> 07Octa you should see his interview in a bit on the forums :)
<ValtheJean> found it
<RobotPinkie> It's my favorite soft drink.
<Luna> 07We created a new meme around it
<VioletVanilla> Or at least not an shop around here
<ValtheJean> damn
<WhatPayne> I've drank many soft drinks before, and am like only one I know who likes it. :/
<ValtheJean> the image is kinda tiny
<ValtheJean> but for now it works
<Luna> 07I need a big one
<Luna> 07;)
<RobotPinkie> Unfortunately I don't live in the US so I can't really indulge in it as much :P
<WhatPayne> Dr. Pepper I mean
<Luna> 07keep looking
<ValtheJean> kk, I'll keep looking
<Octavia> 14Whatre we looking for exactly atm?
<ValtheJean> whew
<ValtheJean> never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually try to upload this image
<ValtheJean> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
<VioletVanilla> What is it like?
<Luna> 07http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
<ValtheJean> that link works for everyone, right?
<Wrek> 06yeah
<WhatPayne> It's like cola for adults I think
<Octavia> 14Ywah
<ValtheJean> kk
<Luna> 07yes
<Octavia> 14*yeah
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh god why
<Luna> 07dat response
<Apokalipse> adults drink cola too.
<VioletVanilla> The only cola I drink regularly is Coca-Cola
<ValtheJean> oh oh wait
<ValtheJean> I have the meme!
<ValtheJean> http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
<Octavia> 14lol
<WhatPayne> I like Mezzo Mix as well.
<CharlesAppleJackson> yeah that's a definite boot to the head
<RobotPinkie> It's kinda like Jolt and some cherry soft drink had a baby..... maybe.
<Wrek> 06"boot to the ehad"
<Wrek> 06nice
<RobotPinkie> It's hard to describe tastes, I think. :P
<Apokalipse> Mezzo Mix is awesome
<Octavia> 14Naaa naaa
<WhatPayne> I discovered Mezzo when I visited Berlin
<Luna> 07Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
<Apokalipse> Funny, I've just been to Berlin a couple of days ago
<Apokalipse> But I knew of Mezzo Mix before
<Luna> 07Do you have anything to add?
<Octavia> 14"The best defense is a god offense. You know who said that? Mel, the cook on Alice. lol
<VioletVanilla> Mezzo is delicious <3
<WhatPayne> Interestingly we had not had Mezzo when I visited Berlin (That was early last year) and we did not get that drink here.
*RobotPinkie hits "Replay" for the 10th time on "Are You Proud to be a Brony?"
<CharlesAppleJackson> nothing that I think would help me in any way :I
<Octavia> 14Got up early and everything and still missed pretty much the entire interview. :P
<WhatPayne> But soon after that visit the stores around started to import it.
<Apokalipse> There's an awesome soft drink here (Slovenia) that is my favorite though
<VioletVanilla> Does anypony that comes to Deutschland visit anywhere OTHER than Berlin? XD
<Apokalipse> Such a shame I can never discuss it because nobody knows how it tastes
<RobotPinkie> I've never had Mezzo Mix... no idea what it is.
<Luna> 07We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
<Luna> 07Please join our next regular BMN show as we will post further recruitment updates there.
<Apokalipse> Yes, I've been to Munich several times
<WhatPayne> What it's called.
<ValtheJean> lol, what an interview it was :P
<VioletVanilla> Okay. Good.
<CharlesAppleJackson> alright
<Apokalipse> Cockta... Now before you jump to conclusions the name is derived from Cocktail
<WhatPayne> :D
<CharlesAppleJackson> thanks for the consideration
<Octavia> 14I always miss the best moments. lol
<RobotPinkie> I've been to Germany, but not Berlin, VioletVanilla, so I guess me :P
<WhatPayne> I've been thinking of visiting the alps.
<WOOOOWOOODFBDS> ME TOO
<VioletVanilla> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Cockta.jpg/250px-Cockta.jpg
<Apokalipse> That's it
<VioletVanilla> We shall visit the Swiss Alps together. <3
<Apokalipse> I go to Austria many times for skiing. It's great
<RobotPinkie> You and who, VioletVanilla?
<WhatPayne> I guess he meant me?
<RobotPinkie> lol oh, WhatPayne
<RobotPinkie> I jelly, I've never been there
<VioletVanilla> ^.^; She actually WhatPayne
<VioletVanilla> XD
<RobotPinkie> lol
<WhatPayne> Sorry *she
<VioletVanilla> :3 I am a proud Pegasis~
<Octavia> 14So which was he again? I dont remember seeing that name in the recruitment forum.
<Luna> 07soo hmm.. how do I save the chat log at once? Looks like ctrl + A doesn't work
<VioletVanilla> And one of the only in this Bratwürstefest~
<RobotPinkie> I thought it was just all "bronies"
<WhatPayne> We don't have he/she distinction in finnish language.
<Luna> 07in mIRC that is
<Octavia> 14Copy/paste?
<WhatPayne> That's my excuse.
<Luna> 07yea ;)
<Octavia> 14Oooh.
<VioletVanilla> I've joined the herd that says there's bronies and pegasis
<VioletVanilla> ;3 is fine WhatPayne~
<CharlesAppleJackson> I like having the term pegasis just because I appreciate a god pun
<CharlesAppleJackson> >god pun
<Octavia> 14Not sure bout mIRC. If it wont let you simply copy it.
<WhatPayne> Dont hate me ;_;
<Octavia> 14Print screen? and crop? Lmao
<VioletVanilla> sehr gut meine freunde ;D
<ValtheJean> Alright: I posted on the interviews thread with updated links for all the images
<ValtheJean> since they're tied to my photobucket, they shouldn't be going away any day soon
<VioletVanilla> sie wurden vergeben, WhatPayne!
<VioletVanilla> <3
<WhatPayne> danke schön
<Octavia> 14So who was he exactly? "CharlesAppleJohnson" doesnt ring a bell.
<ValtheJean> oh oh sathi
<VioletVanilla> bitte sehr
<ValtheJean> you're going to love me
<ValtheJean> go into tools
<ValtheJean> then log files
<VioletVanilla> Suddenly, silence. . .
<ValtheJean> it'll have the entire log saved for you
<RobotPinkie> Wiederbelebungsgetränke, or something of that sort
<VioletVanilla> I feel scared T~T
<Apokalipse> Please stop confusing my mind. It has but one year of German leaning experience. And not very good experience at that
<RobotPinkie> :P
<Octavia> 14Oh, it keeps logs like IM clients, nifty.
<ValtheJean> :P
<Apokalipse> learning*
<VioletVanilla> Energy drinks, RobotPinkie? XD
<Octavia> 14Didnt think about that, but I've never looked back at old convos on mIRC either.
<RobotPinkie> It's an item from a game in German we had on C64 when I was a little kid, VioletVanilla :P
<VioletVanilla> Or verbatim "Resuscitation drinks"
<RobotPinkie> I'm pretty sure that it keeps you from dying when you hit 0 hearts
<Luna> 07Bah :(
<VioletVanilla> :3
<ValtheJean> do you want me to save it out as a text file for you?
<RobotPinkie> yep :P
<Octavia> 14Oh, thats why. He goes by "CAJ"
<Luna> 07it looks a bit messy now on the forums
<Luna> 07take a peek
<Octavia> 14Ehh, its not so bad.
<RobotPinkie> I do understand most German, though... what with knowing a lot of Dutch
<Octavia> 14Little messed.
<Luna> 07yer a little
<ValtheJean> the important thing is we can read what he wrote
<Octavia> 14:P
<VioletVanilla> Yeah~
<WhatPayne> Dutch is really weird language.
<Apokalipse> I don't :p
<Octavia> 14Think its retarded mIRC wont just let you copy/paste it.
<Luna> 07WAT?!
<Luna> 07Weird?
<RobotPinkie> I wub Dutch, lol
<VioletVanilla> I'm a bit Hungary, don't Dutch my Komputer while I'm Norway~
<ValtheJean> lol, don't tell that to dari :P
<RobotPinkie> Especially when women speak Dutch, I think it sounds very nice and soft :3
<Octavia> 14Ugh, he was the attention horse too.
<Luna> 07I agree
<WhatPayne> Sorry, but I tried to learn some words when I visited Netherlands, and I could not.
<Luna> 07Welcome Violet
<VioletVanilla> Thank you, greetings to you all.
<ValtheJean> I'll probably only be able to stick around for the first part of this interview
<Apokalipse> How do you say beer in dutch?
<ValtheJean> as I've got an evening class in about an hour >.,
<ValtheJean> >.<*
<Octavia> 14Yay VV
<VioletVanilla> köstlich~ <3
<VioletVanilla> I mean, how do you say it Robotpinkie? :3
<Octavia> 14Greetings
<Luna> 07Violet, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
<RobotPinkie> Bier
<RobotPinkie> Not 100% on the spelling...
<Luna> 07Do you have any questions before we start?
<RobotPinkie> I haven't been to the Netherlands in maybe 5-6 years
<Luna> 07correct Robot
<Apokalipse> Oh, like German then
<VioletVanilla> No, I understand.
<WhatPayne> Netherlands was nicest country in whole EU I've been in.
<VioletVanilla> jaja
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Suinide and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Luna> 07How did you hear about us?
<RobotPinkie> I'm gonna have to break out my Dutch-Swedish dictionary if you have more questions :P
<RobotPinkie> I do still understand almost everything, though.
<Apokalipse> That means I know how to say beer in 8 languages. I am so multilingual
<RobotPinkie> During my Dutch aunt's birthday there were having a pretty high level discussion in Dutch, and I joined in in English. Fun times.
<RobotPinkie> *they were
<VioletVanilla> I was searching for Brony sites on Google and stumbled upon Brony State as one of the top sites.
<Octavia> 14Reading CAJs interviewa a bit right now too... "... shit man" Lmao
<Luna> 07What do you like about Brony State?
<ValtheJean> lol yeah, that's what sparked the meme :P
<WhatPayne> Luna where are you from?
<mib_cj7pfq> Ummm....hi?
<RobotPinkie> Hi mib_cj7pfq :P

<Octavia> 14>mfw listing skills like singing and videogames that have hardly anything to do with being a mod here lol
<VioletVanilla> The fact that all of the staff are very respectful, the layout of the site is very simple yet easily navigated. Being able to join other fans of My Little Pony in discussions and viewing of the show is encouraging and enjoyable. Many of the members are talkative and inclusive to newcomers.
<RobotPinkie> Haha, oh wow
<ValtheJean> :P
<Luna> 07Anything else?
<WhatPayne> I would not question Fluttershy's ability to make warface :/
<VioletVanilla> In my personal opinion, it's one of the best sites community wise, and the selection of content is suitable for most ages.
<Pinkie_Pie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/fic/src/131415370620.jpg
<Octavia> 14He didnt even know BronyState has been posted on EqD. lol Though I spose not everyone likes EqD
<Pinkie_Pie> Warface, you say?
<RobotPinkie> ...true. The dragon and cockatrice would certainly not question her.
<Luna> 07How many movienights have you attended so far?
<ValtheJean> I never go to EqD but I knew it was advertised there :P
<DecapKing> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLyykueP00&NR=1 This video is wrong, but the music is fitting
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Hasbro&#39;s Official Stance on Rainbow Dash&#39;s Sexuality" - "I just had an idea."
<WhatPayne> Interestin, you would expect ponies to make weapons with triggest that are capable to operate with hooves.
<VioletVanilla> I have attended five movie nights for European and four US thus far.
<WhatPayne> Damn that derp spelling
<Luna> 07Tell us a bit about yourself
<RobotPinkie> lol yeah I've seen that one
<Octavia> 14lol
<WhatPayne> But my point remains.
<Octavia> 14"LETS DO THIS!"
<RobotPinkie> True. I wonder how a sniper rifle would look on the actual show...

<DecapKing> Like Ponies Anthology
<Luna> 07do what?
<WhatPayne> I'd imagine huge trigger guard capable to fit whole hoof...
<ValtheJean> >CAJ interview, what he said at the beginning
<Octavia> 14He said it right before the images portion. :P
<Luna> 07oh right :P
<ValtheJean> oh...right >.<
<WhatPayne> Bigger question is how would pony without wings carry said weapon while moving,
<VioletVanilla> Well, I'm a twenty year old girl from Vienna, Austria. I was born there and lived there for five years until my family relocated to Dresden, Saxony, Germany. I enjoy playing video games and tinkering with computers as I'm currently studying I.T in University. I have been classically trained in Piano Performance for fifteen years. I've recently gotten into
<Octavia> 14Austria, nice nice.
<Octavia> 14Me Gusta
<ValtheJean> haha! I wasn't the only one to be harassed by the text limit each post! :P
<RobotPinkie> I imagine that they could design an appropriate holster
<Octavia> 14lol
<Octavia> 14I like that she has a lot to say and takes the time to say it all.
<WhatPayne> Or some sort of carrying sling to hold it ready in place...
<VioletVanilla> baking and learning how to cook. I am currently employed as a secretary at a small office where I work daily.
<WhatPayne> This is weird subject.
<Luna> 07me too
<ValtheJean> but but! What about the "...aw shit, man!" answers? They are so eloquent and beautiful :P
<RobotPinkie> Rarity designs such slings for the Equestrian Armed Forces, I'm pretty sure :P
<Luna> 07her mom is a teacher
<Pinkie_Pie> Anyone here want to see a possible MLP season 2 spoiler?
<Pinkie_Pie> I wont post it in mane chat
<Octavia> 14I agree. I do enjoy me some "... oh shit" answers once in a while.
<Pinkie_Pie> I will PM it
<Apokalipse> I do
<RobotPinkie> Not really, no
<WhatPayne> depend on the magnitude of said spoiler
<Luna> 07Do you have any experience with moderating?
<VioletVanilla> I live by myself out of a small townhaus with my pet dog Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
<ValtheJean> ewwww....dog owner (j/k)
<Luna> 07Cool dog name
<Luna> 07Amadeaus Mozart :)
<Luna> 07how classic
<prince-dari> Eugh dogs.
<Octavia> 14I like it. :D
<Pinkie_Pie> Episode 1/2 spoiler
<Luna> 07I figured you would
<Octavia> 14Shit.
<Pinkie_Pie> The pilot pretty much
<Octavia> 14Now the Falco song is playing in my head.
<Pinkie_Pie> Its info from the script
<ValtheJean> also lawl sathi "classic"...as he was a classical composer....haha....ic wut u did that
<ValtheJean> thar*
<VioletVanilla> I have average experience moderating, my last work of doing so was on a small forum's IRC channel.
<WhatPayne> Meaning what will happen in first episode as the plot goes? Then no thanks.
<Pinkie_Pie> Yeah, and ok
<Pinkie_Pie> Just offering it to anyone who does want to know

<RobotPinkie> @ponyrollmeter Everyone
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Everyone is 47% ponyroll. (1557)
<VioletVanilla> My availability is from 5:30PM CEST until about 12AM or 1AM depending on my work load; 2PM until 2AM on weekends.
<Luna> 07hmm untill 2 am could be problematic
<RobotPinkie> And you know you love it.
<prince-dari> p0[], a4[] r6[d]
<AllisZero> Sigh, this is retarded.
<VioletVanilla> @cutemeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 70% cute. (1558)
<prince-dari> There, now he/she will think that we mods have our own secret language.
<Luna> 07as the saturday broadcast starts at 1 am on saturday
<ValtheJean> lol
<Luna> 07troll fari
<RobotPinkie> What is, AllisZero?
<Luna> 07What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
<WhatPayne> hm, let's try

<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 69% awesome. (1559)
<WhatPayne> @rightmeter Steven_Magnet
<Luna> 07In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Steven_Magnet is 41% right. (1560)
<Apokalipse> Oh, nice number there
<ValtheJean> that's a shame...she's been looking like a really strong candidate to this point
<Luna> 07As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<AllisZero> Eh, one of my users can't print, update printer drivers, etc. She's on 32-bit, but all other 32-bit clients work because I won't do anything without testing it...
<Octavia> 14lol Dari
<Octavia> 14What a troll, jeez
<WhatPayne> What?
<Octavia> 14And I agree.
<RobotPinkie> That's... weird
<Luna> 07did you enjoy my trolling last night?
<ValtheJean> with the G3 stuff?

<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "PMV: Dare to be Stupid" - "Song used: Dare to be Stupid by Weird Al Yankovic"
<Luna> 07yea and more
<Octavia> 14Well, Sathi is always trolling with that stuff anyway. :P
<ValtheJean> well I always enjoy it, just because people's reactions to it are priceless :P
<prince-dari> Oh yeah Sathi.
<prince-dari> It was great. XD
<prince-dari> We didn't get to see how the epsiodes ended though. :(
<AllisZero> Yet still, the machine simply won't take the updated drivers like everyone else, and it's making me mad.
<Octavia> 14My memory is fuzzy, remind me. :P
<Luna> 07SOON!
<prince-dari> The seaponies are still frozen under the ice!
*RobotPinkie hits replay on "Pinkie's Lie" for the 10th time today
<Octavia> 14Oooh yeah. That. lol
<ValtheJean> I grew up with 3 older sisters, so I've learned to have an unnatural threshold for tolerating girl's shows :P
<VioletVanilla> As far as my abilities go, as aforementioned, I can stream a wide variety of shows. I'm also able to do musical DJing or Radio Shows. One idea I had was to expand the site to include podcasts or group oriented radio shows that would entertain or draw in members weekly. Many members enjoy livestreams for different personalities and that would be a good opening
<Octavia> 14Fuek der sea ponies.
*DecapKing wonders where the stream is
<RobotPinkie> Ouch... I hate when stuff like that happens. Makes me glad I don't work with it.
<Octavia> 14They could just shoo be doo their ways out!
<WhatPayne> How would IT Crowd handle that problem?
<ValtheJean> I like her answer there
<Synros> hey everyone
<Luna> 07me too
<RobotPinkie> Oh that's right, when's stream, Luna?
<Synros> hows it going
<ValtheJean> she and I could organize music related streams :P
<VioletVanilla> I also think that having a slight heavier member focus as far as content goes would be helpful as well.
<RobotPinkie> hay Synros
<WhatPayne> Have you tried turning it on and off again?
<Luna> 07could you clarify that?
<FreezeFrame> Huh, new You're Gonna Go Far Kid PMV was made
<FreezeFrame> For Twilight/NMM

<Octavia> 14Hey, that was my idea!
<FreezeFrame> Well, that's the Twilight one.
<ValtheJean> I wasn't around for your interview!
<RobotPinkie> Still sped up audio, lol
<Octavia> 14Though I figured since we do movies and shows, that a music stream wouldn't really be our... thing. lol
<DecapKing> well might i say, it works
<FreezeFrame> Yeah
<FreezeFrame> Dunno why they all use the sped one
<Octavia> 14I didn't mention it in my interview because I didn't think it would get any praise. :P
<FreezeFrame> The sped up one actually fits the RD one, since sped up Offspring's lead singer does sound kinda like Dash.
<Luna> 07a weekly podcast might be cool though
<RobotPinkie> Well it kinda works, but I love the regular song
<DecapKing> probally to make the videos shorter or to have the higher pitch
<ValtheJean> bah! You must be more assertive Octavia!
<ValtheJean> >had no idea you were thinking similar things
*ValtheJean is now offended :P
<Octavia> 14But I was apart of Everypony radio for a while and used to music streaming more.
<Octavia> 14lol
<VioletVanilla> A good example would be to have our members contribute their own projects, art, music, fictions, etc. onto the site. Maybe even combine the two ideas and have their own input goes. Have their fiction read live, or their talents showcased once a month or something.
<RobotPinkie> Yeah probably to make the pitch sound cartoony
<Octavia> 14A weekly podcast would be awesome.
<ValtheJean> AHHHHH
<ValtheJean> NOT FANFICS
<ValtheJean> NOT FANFICS!!!!!!!!!
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Octavia> 14Lmao
<ValtheJean> :(
<VioletVanilla> Also, having a set polling system for users as to what they'd like to see, taking what's done during the lottery on BMN and having special segments during the week as well.
<prince-dari> Trololo
<DecapKing> it wouldnt sound right with the normal pitch having these clips playing
<Octavia> 14But yeah, we could always filter it of course so nothing like Cupcakes gets through. :P
<Luna> 07I like her ideas
<Octavia> 14Dari is such a troll. lol
<ValtheJean> yeah, she's got some good ideas
<Octavia> 14Yeah, shes certainly got some nice ideas going.
<ValtheJean> minus the fanfic readings :P
<DecapKing> they have an applejack one with normal speed audio
<ValtheJean> >mfw you're going to make ME read them out loud as punishment >.<
<Luna> 07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<FreezeFrame> Yeah, but it fits Applejack
<RobotPinkie> I dunno about that, most PMVs use normal audio
<Octavia> 14Well, some fanfics are alright. lol But I dont know how many people would stick around for it.
<RobotPinkie> Though sped up works with the Pinkie Pie Numa Numa video
<FreezeFrame> The applejack one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMfws-KSYE

<prince-dari> Cya then.
<Octavia> 14Oh yeah.
<Luna> 07see you later Val
<Octavia> 14See what happens when you have too much fun? lol
<Octavia> 14Laters Val
<ValtheJean> Sorry to leave so soon, hope the interview goes well ;)
<ValtheJean> I GO!
<AllisZero> What the hay man
<Octavia> 14To make ze magicks!

<Octavia> 14I really like the idea of a weekly podcast though.
<VioletVanilla> I believe that I can help the site grow through word of mouth, and contributions, both thought and planwise. I also enjoy social gatherings specifically on Brony Movie Nights and like to make sure that every member is being treated well and having an enjoyable time.
<Synros> why must the plastic around new cds be so annoying?
<Octavia> 14I wanted us to do something similar to what EqD does, where we chat back and forth about various things. But... Skype, ugh!
<AllisZero> >still buys cds
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I know of Firefly
<FreezeFrame> I occasionally do that.
<RobotPinkie> I still buy CDs too, I like having the lyrics and info in a booklet
<FreezeFrame> There's a few stores where it's cheaper than buying the album on iTunes
<RobotPinkie> ...not all that often though
<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: That'd be good if they still did that.
<AllisZero> Last CD I bought was Pokemon the Movie.
<AllisZero> Not even lyin'
<Luna> 07the only trouble I see now is her availability
<Synros> i like to have the artwork for the albums
<VioletVanilla> Also, being able to help other mods so that there isn't too much pressure or stress on them.
<Octavia> 14Looks like she was well-prepared for this. She be a sneaky one. :P
<Octavia> 14And yeah, I know. :(
<RobotPinkie> Um, they quite often do, FreezeFrame

<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: Not half the ones I've gotten of late.
<RobotPinkie> I guess it depends on what music you listen to, I dunno
<RobotPinkie> Maybe I should check online before buying CDs...
<WhatPayne> When I first heard that I song went lol.
<FreezeFrame> Last CD I purchased was Straight Outta Lynwood by Weird Al
<Luna> 07For clarification purposes; you mentioned your availability earlier,if you attend a movie night do you watch the entire show or only the mane section?
<RobotPinkie> I do like being able to just rip everything to every device I have though
<RobotPinkie> and CD lets me do that :P
<FreezeFrame> Buying 'em on iTunes does that, too
<RobotPinkie> it does?
<FreezeFrame> iTunes hasn't had DRM in years.
<AllisZero> Otherwise they would've sunk harder than the titanic
*Luna knows she also likes RP
<RobotPinkie> so you can now get uncompressed music DRM-free from iTunes?
<Octavia> 14Aww :P
*Octavia 14isn't much an RPer
<VioletVanilla> I make sure to stay for as long as possible. Only once have I had to leave before the entire event was over.
*Octavia 14now feels left out lol
<Octavia> 14Eh, only once had to leave early.
<FreezeFrame> Yup
<Luna> 07hmm
<RobotPinkie> Because then I guess I might buy a lot less CDs :P
<FreezeFrame> It's Apple Lossless Codec, but you can convert that inside iTunes
<Luna> 07so she does stay?
<Synros> its just personal preferance. No need to argue
<AllisZero> We ... aren't arguing
<Luna> 07I see, thank you
<Synros> stop fight!!! please!
<Synros> this is madness!!
<Luna> 07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
<RobotPinkie> Well as long as it's lossless, you can convert it to whatever you like, so that's awesome
<Octavia> 14Well, she said only once has she had to leave before the entire event was over. So I'm assuming that means she's been around for all the ones shes attended the entire time, except once.
<Luna> 07I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
<Luna> 07Please tell me when your ready
<Synros> ok ima buy from Itunes from now on. I still cannot get this platic off
<RobotPinkie> lol Synros
<Luna> 07did you voted on CAJ yet?
<Octavia> 14Yeah...
<Octavia> 14lol
<FreezeFrame> If I had more money, I'd be buying Season 1 in HD right now, actually
<Octavia> 14Nope.gif
<VioletVanilla> I am ready.
<WhatPayne> Season 1 Blu-Ray can't be out already
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, some CDs I'll probably still buy
<Octavia> 14Her body is ready!
<FreezeFrame> WhatPayne: S1 is on iTunes

<AllisZero> Of MLP?
<FreezeFrame> Unfortunately, I only have 50 bucks, and I need to get some breakfast food for weekends, since the cafeteria on campus doesn't open until 11 on weekends
<AllisZero> Srs?
<Synros> anyone wanna come over and help me? this is getting depressing
<WhatPayne> Hard copy?
<FreezeFrame> Yes, AllisZero
<RobotPinkie> Very happy I got Icky Thump as a CD, nice booklet
<FreezeFrame> No, iTunes
<AllisZero> Eh
<WhatPayne> I don't iTunes
<Luna> 07Let's see how she handles these
<AllisZero> I want the DVD just to have the box
<AllisZero> Neither do I.
<FreezeFrame> It's 50 bucks for the HD version of every ep
<RobotPinkie> are iTunes videos also DRM free?
<Octavia> 14Yeah, this is the tough part. At least it was for me.
<FreezeFrame> Let me check the file on the free ones I have
<Octavia> 14If you've got a different guideline to this like I did that you're used to, it can be difficult.
<WhatPayne> Me too, even if the artwork would be horrible, I would want to buy the case.
<RobotPinkie> I want the Blu Ray box, if they make one :3
<RobotPinkie> because that will look awesome
<FreezeFrame> Looks like it may, since it wouldn't open in Media Player Classic
<Luna> 07but you can keep practicing with these
<VioletVanilla> The picture you have posted has some heavy implications to mature content. This is a verbal warning, try to keep in mind that this is a chat group for all ages.
<Luna> 07there's many pony images allover the web
<RobotPinkie> and if it doesn't, I'll just print a custome cover for it :P
<FreezeFrame> But then again, MPC's been being shitty for me.
<Octavia> 14Yeah, I'm still trying to wean myself into it.
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie I would do the exact same!
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, FreezeFrame
<Octavia> 14I know, you should see my pic archive on my computer. XP
<FreezeFrame> Okay, it does

<FreezeFrame> But that's probably a concession to the video owners
<Luna> 07show me
<WhatPayne> Just did few new covers to my PS3 games recently
<FreezeFrame> I just tried in WMP, that failed, too
<Octavia> 14I've just always been used to a more lax stance on images, so its something I'm still working on.'
<Octavia> 14XD
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay
<prince-dari> Wrek
<Octavia> 14I dont have it uploaded anywhere atm. lol
<FreezeFrame> I like the PS3 games that do the art on the opposite side
<RobotPinkie> I'm thinking of doing that too, WhatPayne. Some have pretty awful cover art
<prince-dari> WREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
<WhatPayne> This thread helped me a bunch: http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=442713
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> Like Splatterhouse... I want it to look a lot more like the old Splatterhouse covers :P
<Luna> 07is drawing stuff most likely
<Octavia> 14Probably
<Luna> 07Also FYI the teammeeting will be held during the saturday broadcast
<RobotPinkie> oooh, thanks for the link, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> No problem. :)
<VioletVanilla> That image contains graphic sensual material and is inappropriate for this chat group. Do not post material of this kind.
<Octavia> 14Ah, okay. Was going to ask if we had a time for it.
<Luna> 07Third image:

<Octavia> 14During the broadcast? Might be kinda hard to keep an eye on the chat too, but I guess we'll manage.
<RobotPinkie> and someone has made a custom Splatterhouse cover, yay!
<Luna> 07We are a super-team we be fine ;)
<Octavia> 14:P
<Octavia> 14We gonna have it in here or you prefer Skype?
<Luna> 07I think here
<RobotPinkie> dunno why I love those games so much...
<Luna> 07but we'll see
<Octavia> 14I wish Skype would work for our conference calls. But then we'd probably just have everyone talking over each other.
<WhatPayne> Nice. If you have decent inkjet printer and photograph paper, these are quite easy to print yourself.
*FreezeFrame only has a color laser
<RobotPinkie> Might be able to, I just need to get more ink for it :P
<prince-dari> I don't get it, gave a verbal warning for the first picture.
<prince-dari> She seemed to be on the right track.
<Crainy> im bored
<prince-dari> But the second picture she just said "Don't post that".
<WhatPayne> lasers can do good job too. I have no direct experience tho but knowing there is laser photo paper, it should work.
<prince-dari> Rather than stating a course of action.
<Octavia> 14She might be used to the same type of guidelines I've been.
<Octavia> 14Thats why I hate how things are so subjective. lol
<VioletVanilla> This picture, while it does contain minor sensual material, in my view is suitable for this chat.
<Luna> 07:P
<Octavia> 14Whats wrong to some isnt wrong to others. :P
<RobotPinkie> Everything alright, Luna?
<prince-dari> I argued that point with Ghosties and some other mods already.
<prince-dari> I wouldn't bother.
<Octavia> 14Think I've also been desensitized by /b/ over the years too however. :P
<Luna> 07Fourth and final image:

<RobotPinkie> @proud_to_be_a_bronymeter RobotPinkie
<Steven_Magnet> 6 RobotPinkie is 79% proud_to_be_a_brony. (1561)
<Octavia> 14I'm not trying to argue it. Just saying.
<RobotPinkie> Lies!
<Octavia> 14Fourth image is easiest, even I know that;s over the line.
<Luna> 07Oh yes, just a bit busy
<Luna> 07mod duties
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-twilight-will-not-allow-any-casualties.jpg
<Pinkie_Pie> Meteor, where did you go?
<Synros> lol decapking
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-eeyup.jpg
<WhatPayne> OMGWTFBBQ!!!11!1
<RobotPinkie> Ah okay, hope you're not getting too swamped :)
<VioletVanilla> This image is highly graphic is sensual and violent nature; It is very inappropriate and as the rules clearly state you are subject to a permanent ban.
<DecapKing> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-fluttershy-is-ghost-lol.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Luna, I mean, lol
<Luna> 07nailed it
<RobotPinkie> Man, people should make custom FiM covers for games...
<WhatPayne> I just saw quite gross picture of Fluttershy
<Luna> 07Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
<RobotPinkie> I'd totally print and use those :P
<Octavia> 14Yup yup.
<Synros> it got really cold in my room when I looked at Fluttershy's face in that MW3 picture.....
<Octavia> 14She dun good on that one.
<Luna> 07Do you have anything to add?
<RobotPinkie> I'm sorry to hear that, WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie, I've been thinking the same
<WhatPayne> Are you aware of Tryponyphobia?
*FreezeFrame decides to read Loosenin' Up
<FreezeFrame> Because Octavia/Soarin'
<RobotPinkie> I might actually give it a go sometime, WhatPayne, I do a lot of image editing :3
<Octavia> 14Wait, am I getting shipping with Soarin?
<RobotPinkie> I'm sure someone who's a proper artist could do a much better job, though...
<DecapKing> Yes you are Octavia
<WhatPayne> I do too, even through I linked that thread I just had to make my own covers.
<Octavia> 14imokaywiththis.jpg
<RobotPinkie> Oh wow... I could use the Scoota Fisher pic to make a custom cover for the Splinter Cell Trilogy that's coming out
<Octavia> 14But he loves THAT BIG APPLE PIE more
<VioletVanilla> Only that I thank you for your time and the opportunity to apply for this position. I look forward to your verdict.
<RobotPinkie> My head just exploded a bit at that thought
<Luna> 07We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
<Luna> 07Please join our next regular BMN show as we will post further recruitment updates there.
<Octavia> 14Still a little confused about her times though. Since I'm not used to European times, I had to look it up. Seems to be confusing me a little so far though...
<Synros> ha
<WhatPayne> That's quite brilliant. Be careful or soon there's going to be a new trend ponifying games
<DecapKing> no, he just likes pie in general
<Luna> 07feel free to ask her
<DecapKing> octavia=Pinkie Pies sister
<RobotPinkie> If that becomes a trend, then I will be very happy :P
<Luna> 07and I hate dem timezones too...
<Octavia> 14Well, she stated her times fine. But so far I'm getting times that arent even during BMN...
<VioletVanilla> Thank you. I will, the update is at the beginning, correct?
<Synros> I think there is a peice outside my window RobotPinkie, I'll mail it back to you
<Luna> 07Yes, but sometimes we contact candidates before the show
<Luna> 07well ask her now :)
<RobotPinkie> lol thanks, Synros
<VioletVanilla> Okay, thank you, I will be here either way, just for clarification purposes.
<Luna> 07saves us from any trouble in the future
<Octavia> 14Its 9:30pm there right now. She said shes available from 5:30pm until maybe 1am her time. That seems early in the day
<Octavia> 14Not sure how to ask her.
<Synros> may take a couple days, postal service here sucks
<FwriedWrice> thats some hardcore tachycardia
<Daz> sounds like a plan, Luna
<Daz> oshitson dari in deep trouble xD
<Dermathil> FOREMAN, GTFO YOU AFFECTED INDIVIDUAL
<Dermathil> YOU ARE A PATIENT NOW
<Luna> 07you are a pirate *cough*
<Sumica> oh look french winterwrap up on eqd =p
<Daz> ...hey prince-dari i just thought ... did you have to script your EQD script to not post if it's the same title as before? if so, hats off to you, sir.
<RainBroDash> 10French WWU?! I'M THERE
<Daz> :3
<Steven_Magnet> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<Dermathil> LOL
<Steven_Magnet> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<RainBroDash> 10also: cool I'll open the stream page for some House in a minute :D
<Nittany_Tiger> Hey, the fun bot.
<Ghosties> 4HE'S SUPER SPECIAL PATIENT, LEVEL 8
<prince-dari> Pfft, French. :P
<Daz> levuru eito
<Dermathil> YOUR VERY OWN CUSTOMIZABLE THERMOMETER
<DecapKing> whos french?
<Daz> so is that part of the script, dari?
<Ghosties> 4You are
<prince-dari> Is what?
<DecapKing> no, I am Russian
<Daz> DecapKing, the winter wrapup
<Daz> prince-dari, y u no read above?
<Nittany_Tiger> You are a French pirate.
<Ghosties> 4NO, you're Navajo
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<prince-dari> I made a the script to check if the current latest title is different from what it was last time it was checked, then I set up a timer which automatically starts when I connect to this server that starts up a check every 30 seconds.
<Daz> ...thought so. Kudos, my man, kudos!
<prince-dari> Thanks.
<Daz> I remember you saying the 30 seconds part, but i completely forgot you'd have to do the check title thing.
<Daz> :3
<FwriedWrice> anyone know how long to put on one of those suits? freaking long time.
<Sumica> so it turns out that eqd's hit count is so high cause Dari keeps refreshing the page.
<prince-dari> XD
<FwriedWrice> lol
<Ghosties> 4I like this Foreman better. He actually has a sense of humor now
<Daz> hahahaha
<Daz> also, House always says "People never change." What're all your opinions on this? i'm interested to know
<Dermathil> Partly true.
<Ghosties> 4The more things change, the more things stay the same
<Ghosties> 4That's the saying, right?
<Daz> Hmm
<Dermathil> You can change on the exterior, but deep inside you will always be the same person.
<Sumica> Same shit different day also works.
<Ghosties> 4Awww, Happy Foreman left :(
<Daz> what about, Dermathil, that 'one year' thing? they say it takes one year of a facade before that becoues your genuine personality.
<Daz> Sumica: S.S.D.D. / F.N.G. :P
<Nittany_Tiger> I like to think that you can change.
<Dermathil> Never heard of that hting before, Daz.
<Daz> Dermathil, i think i read it somewhere in some motivational thread on 4chan's /b/ a few years ago or something. Yea, i think i did.
<Ghosties> 4OH GOD

<RobotPinkie> That's pretty damn bleak
<Dashite> STEAM

<prince-dari> I wanted to see his eye explode and brain matter go everywhere.
<prince-dari> :(
<Daz> Best intro theme. I just wanna say this again: why in the blazes are there different intro themes for different coutries?!?
<Ghosties> 4Yes, let's kill Foreman so we can save him
<Ghosties> 4Makes perfect sense!

<RobotPinkie> fuck.... forgot my water boiler
<Ziltoid> chase is worst pony
<RobotPinkie> tea is massively delayed :(
<Daz> >House geniunely givesadamn about Foreman. :3
<Daz> RobotPinkie: wat still not had that tea?!?
<Daz> but but
<Ghosties> 4That's because House is the ultimate tsundere
<Daz> tsundere?
<Daz> is that a trope?
<Ghosties> 4:3
<Daz> if so i dunno what it is
<Ghosties> 4Tsundere means a person is generally cold and distant at first, but eventually warms up to partners or other characters
<AllisZero> I-it's not like I want to diagnose you or a-anything, baka.
<Ghosties> 4In House's case, his Tsundereism is extreme
<Daz> ah i see. thanks for that Ghosties
<Daz> AllisZero: desudesu
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<prince-dari> Lol
<Ziltoid> desudesu indeed
<Daz> That mouse is seeing places :3
<prince-dari> If the rat dies, it's good.
<Nittany_Tiger> It is it is?
<AllisZero> Cute mouse
<prince-dari> Then we can mash its head with a hammer and find a cure.
<prince-dari> Yay!
<Ghosties> 4>pounds on numbers
<Ghosties> 4>thinks he's called his dad
<Daz> well, prince-dari rat is waaay less biomass so may die sooner, so they can atuopsy. i think that's the plan
<Ghosties> 4LOLWUT
<Daz> STEVE!
<RobotPinkie> Tea is almost done, yay!
<Daz> nice! what one today, RobotPinkie ?
<Daz> I had arabic tea today :3
<Denied_Existence> They need to put a picture of House and put it below the definition.
<Nittany_Tiger> Tea-flavored?
<AllisZero> Wait, that was his rat?
<Dashite> Cane shaped object
<AllisZero> That's mean House
<RobotPinkie> "Forest fruit" tea, Daz. I presume that means "berries" :P
<Ziltoid> they are gonna kill steve...
<Ghosties> 4TAKE YOUR TOP OFF
<RobotPinkie> Especially considering all the berries on the box
<Ziltoid> ....

<WhatPayne> Which might not be that unlikely, there has been Stephen Colbert easter egg in House
<Dashite> You mean the day that The Stig listens to pony music while driving around the test track
<Ziltoid> dat lie
<RobotPinkie> EVEN MY DREAM WAS NINJA'D! FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU-
<Daz> it's GOTTA HAPPEN. house played ninja gaiden black, metroid fusion and metroid prime hunters, and COD6...and probably others i forget.
<Denied_Existence> Silvermane I promise there is a pony farm at the bottom of that pit.
<Dark_Heart> Red vs Blue after this episode plaese

<Hat> the Cheater's Lament
<WhatPayne> Do I have to google pomf?
<Dark_Heart> Abrahat Linkon
<Daz> RobotPinkie: Have. You. Played. 5 days a stranger. ?
<Ziltoid> eeewwww

<Kencolt706> And what show is this?
<RobotPinkie> 5 days a stranger?
<Dashite> Goo!
<AllisZero> Where's scotaloo's EWWWWW
<RobotPinkie> poop?
<RobotPinkie> wow, south park was right...
<Kencolt706> Oh, House...
<Denied_Existence> Ghosties, have some insane logic: Non-mods and un-mods can't type in colors, but isn't white a color?
<Hat> EWWW
<Daz> RobotPinkie: insanelygood game. main character has a trilby hat. he's called Trilby. :P.
<Dark_Heart> talk about a backup
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> WHOS HUNGRY? MEXICAN TAKEOUT?
<Denied_Existence> *Insaneface*
<Daz> oopsie
<DecapKing> yahtzee?
<Hat> hopefully some more ponies will have hats in series 2
<RobotPinkie> I'll have to look that up, Daz
<Dark_Heart> JENGA
<ValtheJean> 2,14 here's some counter insane logic: white is the absence of color :P
<RobotPinkie> if only because trilby hats are best hats
<Pegacorn> Hey Hat,could you be a "Bill's hat" plz?
<Daz> the game is by ben yahtzee croshaw, yea, DecapKing. it's freeware RobotPinkie
<GGgala> >Denied implying IRC text has a true color in the absence of color codes
<DecapKing> is it about people dying?
<Daz> RobotPinkie, you know the yahtzee funny reviewer guy? yea, he made that game
<Denied_Existence> ValtheJean But white light is made up of ALL colors right?
<DecapKing> cause i might of played it
<Daz> DecapKing, well people die alright :P
<Dashite> Hat is totally a Fedora cause they are awesome.
<Daz> it's about Body Mind Soul and "It hurts it hurts it hurts"
<Silvermane> Denied_existence, white Pigment is the absence of the colors
<Kencolt706> Some bedside manner...
<RobotPinkie> Nice, Daz
<Hat> "Francis, is there anything you don't hate?"
<Denied_Existence> Silvermane Are you hating on me for being fair-skinned?
<RobotPinkie> Definitely going to play it now :P
*Pegacorn shoots Silvermane yet again,now with no apparent reason
<WhatPayne> Googling "POMF" did not make any sense,
<Silvermane> denied_existence, yes. Cracka
*Denied_Existence cries.
<Silvermane> pomf is the sound of a wingboner makes
*DecapKing lulz
<Daz> RobotPinkie: reason it's good is a) excellent story, considering 1 guy did it. b) all pixelart, yay, and short games c) I don't think i've ever goosebumped or :Ofaced at any other game as much as that one. srslydude the ending i-OK im srs remembering it i just got another goosebump
<Silvermane> also, it comes from a lolicon hentai, i do believe
<Denied_Existence> I AM GOING TO URBAN DICTIONARY "Pomf"
<AllisZero> ahaha
<RobotPinkie> no spoilan plz!
<WhatPayne> oh... That makes more sense
<Daz> lawl Denied_Existence
<RobotPinkie> I'll definitely play it though, Daz
<GGgala> WhatPayne: POMF is a hybrid meme of wingboner and that lolicon manga meme. someone pasted the "POMF =3" sound effect onto a pic of Rainbow Dash's wingboner springing up and it snowballed
<Daz> RobotPinkie, i won't if you don't want. but suffice to say it's awesome freeware :3
<RobotPinkie> Love Zero Punctuation, so.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Pomf is what you do when you do that thing with the stuff and whatnot wherever you are.
<Dark_Heart> EEEEWWWWW
<WhatPayne> Why I did not know that meme?
<Denied_Existence> POMF	435 up, 21 down The sound you make when you fall backwards onto the bed while being a little girl.
*Silvermane unfurls his wings rapidly. They make a *pomf* sound
<Denied_Existence> Ignore the numbers there
<Daz> ya RobotPinkie if you know zero punctuation you hafta play it. actually, play 5daysastranger, then 7daysaskeptic then trilbysnotes, which has an insane ending, then 4th of quadrology: 'Six Days a Sacrifice.' BLOODY HELL dat ending
<Pegacorn> *Ahem*Gentlemen?
<Denied_Existence> I copypastad
<AllisZero> Successful house is successful
<Denied_Existence> *Ahem* Pegacorn?
*Pegacorn has a dead Spy on his shoulder
<CAJ> @POMFmeter Cutty's ass
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Cutty's ass is 25% POMF. (1585)
<Dermathil> BACKGROUND FLASH
<Daz> what up Pegacorn ?
<Hat> When he presses the music player the galaxy unfolds in his office
<Nittany_Tiger_> Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw is the dude's name.
<Daz> lol
<Dark_Heart> eyup
<herospirit> EUREKA
<RobotPinkie> @assmeter Cuddy's POMF
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Cuddy's POMF is 95% ass. (1586)
*Denied_Existence bites into his Samvich.
<herospirit> House knows all
<Daz> lawls
<Pegacorn> There was a Spy next to the door.
<Dark_Heart> they found oil
<Pegacorn> I killed him.
<Nittany_Tiger_> And I can't recall one of my teacher's names.
*Denied_Existence 's Samvich was a spy!
<WhatPayne> So if I got this right Pomf=wingboner. And Cuddy is 45% wingboner inducing.
<Denied_Existence> Hmmm... *NOM*
<Silvermane> yes
<DecapKing> Pegasi, so inappropriate
*Nittany_Tiger_ explodes
<Denied_Existence> I love Pegasi...mostly because I am one...
*Dermathil finds the blueprints for a sonic screwdriver
<Kencolt706> Pegasai seem to have some emotional display issues?
<Denied_Existence> But you know.
<Pegacorn> BY THE POWER OF LEVARAGE,I SUMMON EVERY TF2 CLASS INTO THIS CHATROOM!
<Pegacorn> *LEVERAGE
<Dashite> Pegasuses are awesome.
<Dermathil> PEGASI, DASHITE, ITS SPELLT PEGASI
<Denied_Existence> Pegasi, Dashite *NAZIFACE*
*Silvermane has a thing for unicorns. Probably something to do with domination and power. But I am a pegasus
<DecapKing> Earth Ponies are better
<RobotPinkie> Pegasises are pretty awesome too, I hear
*Dashite grins
<DecapKing> i say that cause i am an Earth Pony
<CAJ> PegaSissy
<CAJ> hehe
<Pegacorn> I AM BOTH A PEGASUS AND A UNICORN.
<Pegacorn> I WIN
<Dashite> Pegasuses > Unicrons > Filthy Earth Ponies.
<Daz> Pegacorn, dat alicorn isn't it?
*Silvermane removes the fake horn and wings from Pegacorn
*Dermathil is building a sonic screwdriver
<Pegacorn> OW
<Denied_Existence> Wait...does that make me an alicorn father?
<Hat> Applejack is best pony. Can you guess why?
