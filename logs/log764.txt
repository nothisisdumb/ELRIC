Leviag: Keep listening. More cussing to come.
They said shit in the Transformers cartoon movie
I'm guessing PG_13
Again, it's not really a kids' movie. That's why it was released under Touchstone and not Disney.

I've got the super special edition of this movie... audio comentary and signed pictures..
ROGER RAGE
...
I'm talking about how she's able to actually walk on her two feet normally with falling over.
Jazmyn: because there were barely any films that were PG-13, and if it was rated R, then less people could see it
:[
Roger = Pinkamena
Hey guys! What the hell is up with Roger?

Sketch_Toku_Brony: Shut up it's fertilized

WOAH

Originally, the director, Richard Wiliiams (I think) was to have an animator who was going through hard times to animate the sob scenes. Instead, he chose a better (but not as emotionally in there) animator toi do it. He did not get the desired "effect"

04<KrazyNoobs> This show is too rude for kids, and only kids would enjoy it anyway. I hate movie like this, because they have no demographic, except immature people who get a laugh out of potty humor. I respect that a few of the people here are like that... why do I even bother writing long comments? It will disappear into the array of thousands of comments above 3 seconds after it is
the force is strong with this one
Lighten up krazynoobs

He also provided a brief update on Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2—which hired the original writers to pen a script back in November—saying that while there hasn’t been much news on the project, it’s still moving forward. “If you’re a fan, pretty soon you’re going to be very, very, very happy.” Roger Rabbit 2 will be, unsurprisingly, in 3D.

I'M IN THE GROOVE

man Downpour sounds like an EPIC name for an OC...:O must draw! :D
I'm on raritys side
DinkyDoo: Against white people?
Which one?
SpadeMagnes[School: But wai?
thedeus : no
I like them both
RARITY'S A WHOREEEE
Never change Rarity
she is a unicorn, levitate somthing as an umbrella
under the bench?
i like pinkie pie
It ain't dip Rarity calm down
Poor Rarity
im on Derpy's side!
not the trenches
so pretty much Japan is your villian jbh
jbh1145, I love both.......AND SHIP THEM
These two ponies are BOTH my FAVORITES what do I do
Ah yes, the Rarijack flagship episode. I do like this episode.
It's nice the growth the characters have gone through...
Ladies and Gentlemen, Madame Whinesalot.
Rarity this is why u arew worst pony
Come
at
me
No, Rarity is a WHORSE
Frozen
the dip
Rarity is scared or water -______-
ITS JUST MAD.
I remember first watching the Season 1 episodes... good times
'whilst' applejack is so fancy
who hides under a bench?
Not the bench!
MUD
the table
I'm baaaaAAAAAAAaaaack :)
Its comming too fast...i allways loved that line xD
ITS JUST MUD!
God I hate you rarity
you can put the bench over you, you are an unicorn
Alright ponies, I'm gonna go play some Skyrim now, Laters
i liek mud..
dance on that table it should come natural to ya
SpadeMagnes[School: Rarity is amasing...;)
AHHH MUD
MUD NO
Who else searches for animation errors:D
I honesly cannot wait for Season 3 Episode 11, 12 and 13. That one episode sounds exciting, but I won't spoil anything about it.
WAIT A MINUTE! If ponies can heal trees, why can't they heal broken bones like Big Mac's???
STFU RARITY HATERS
ohhhh
Heavy: RARITY is COWARD
Magic.
AJ is best but Rarity is second best, I dunno who I should like
Derpy: I do!
Such a stuck up bitch....
I love this episode (Which is why I chose it)
so she just called rarity useless?
ICY SPY
did applejack just say the five-letter b word?
their voices are different
did AJ said bitching?
BURN
oooo
internet arguments
ha~
math :D
Yay
;)
Heavy:FRIENDSHIP IS STUPID MAGIC
1940. they could've been in Roger Rabbit
So who's yall's favorite pony
Does so Aleph-three
don't use your fancy mathmatics on me
PM!!!!!
Evil stare
Ohhhhhh
Applejack and Rarity do a good impression of an Internet argument.
Infinity + 1 is still infinity
IFINITY + 1=UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
fluttershy
Infinity + 1 .....WHAT?
internet arguments
Flutteershy
AJfan77: spike is best pone
shipping Rarijack started in this episode
PINKIE MY FAVE
I like how this show handles dealing with "friends" who have little in common.
infinity is nothing
Staring Contest ∞+1 GO
They almost nailed it, but they failed on the whole "leave it behind" thing.
aww lovers spat
so much regret
flys out
Because unlike Fluttershy, Big Mac isn't a tree
Rarity sounded different in season 1...
Wow, anyone notice the difference between AJ's voice then and her voice now?
Pinkie is my favorite pony
Applejack sure is a dynamite gal.
back away slowly
shipping
first to blink loses
infinity + infinity x infinity
my queen, her royal highness, Fluttershy
How are these 6 friends again?
Spy:No I think not
rainbow dash: it needs to be 20% cooler

This really is one of the "girliest" episodes of season 1, but oddly, it never bothered me much.
Not her!
twilight
unacceptalbe conditions!!!
Twilight is the best part of this episode
THUNDA!!!
RAUNNNNNNNN
How is it muddy under the table but not anywhere else
Twily 2 the rescue

applejack, dirty
come into the tree
Stellafera: yes

Since when was twilight's house in the middle of a field?
lightning rod = spike
lightning rod ftw!
twi thinks of everything
Applejack is best proletariat
MUD
spikes the lightning rod
uh oh
Sumica got snow
Spike is really holding the rod
Twilight is the only reason I like this episode
... I wonder how long it took her to figure that one out...
fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I blame Rarity's voice.
manners applejack
Seriously when the fuck did her house move?
p
YES AJ BE POLITE
and then they read twilights fanfic.
and won't share
Dance u pony dance
Lightning rod is best rod
Ah, I remember Season 1, where Twilight had to be shoehorned into every episode.....
no text wall
How did AJ get muddy but not Rarity
AJ is not polite
SpadeMagnes[School: Humans are evil bastards, If we werent so fucking stupid, we could stay friends through things like that too...
you gotta admit, muddy prints in someones house is kinda rude
How did Rarity not get her hooves muddy?
Where is Spike?
Fight fight fight
AJ
magic
Twilight wasn'
AJ was under the table
This was pretty much the episode that kick started adorkable Twilight.
Blinky: being cloned
home jajajaja
Slumber party
ROYAL BUSINESS?
\/ /\ A \/ /\ A
Stellafera because Rarity is a fashion pony she knows how to stay clean
Who is looking for Animation Errors?
Twilight wasn't really shoehorned into this one
Spike is in Canterlot
Wasnt twilights house in the middle of the fucking town?
04One of my favorite eps
royal business? spike does it all
now we talking
What sort of ROYAL BUSINESS?
NOPE

Clopping party
Ghosties, you have good tastes.

Why's Spike in Canterlor on Royal Business... ALONE?
I thought he was the lightening rod
:D s;umber party
stop clopping ya faggets
how does one slumber?
*royal business* playing poker
Xajun: Yea, "ROYAL"
same Ghosties
Mistake on the sleepover book :O just look at the pillows
applejack..
So, twilight had no expression right there
as you are
slumber party with Twilight = read books
I wonder what spike thought once he heard that Twilight had a Sleep over with Rarity why he was gone
