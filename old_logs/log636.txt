<Malavolent> > "illegal" :D
<Gold_Demona> yes mentallyeffedguy

<Malavolent> Made me laugh for some reason.
<pony_9995> Malavolent: If you are starting up a game of MvM I'll be brining my Lyra colored Balloonicorn so you know who I am.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: It was referring to the "Go sit in the cornor" to Adam. Being a little smartass...
<mentallyeffedguy> Malavolent: yea i know english fail :P
<XAX> Buytoast: Lol'd at that insult. But anyway, someone just couldn't keep their mouth shut and Wrek told them to quiet, but then he got all dramatic about it and asked for a 24 hour ban so he could face the consequences.
<Wrek> 05Klumzeedragon then its even more laughable
<Malavolent> mentallyeffedguy: Not really the english, just the though of something being "illegal" on anonymous internet chat made me laugh :)
<Wrek> 05not really that anonymous

<seatsea> BronyInstrumental: rock is not my style it more electro or dubstep
*Wrek shares a drink with Gold_Demona

*Gold_Demona also grabs some rum
<Klumzeedragon> mentallyeffedguy: Aaaaaargh! Metal and homework! :P

<Rommulus> Hello all
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: good, because I'm straight edge :D
<AdamTheDuck_> Hello Rommulus
<Gold_Demona> Hi Rommulus
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey Rommulus
<mentallyeffedguy> Klumzeedragon: im not lisening to the stream now, im lisening to punk on spotify :D
<Rommulus> How are we all and what are we all up to this fine day/night?
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Sounds good. What kind of beer do you drink? Only Alcohol I have on hand is Moonshine.
<Phase4> "You should explain why you chose the procedure that you used in section 3.2." i didnt chose, you told me what to do. dont ask me in a lab repot why i chose something you told me to do, its useless
<Phase4> stupid physics
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: Howdy! :) Hows it going?
*Ninny restrains his angry breathing.
<MadSurge> ARGH MOONSHINE ARE YOU A REDNECK nah I'm not serious :D
*Phase4 hugs Ninjazz "whos'
<Phase4> derp
<Wrek> 05mariestad, staropramen
<Wrek> 05maybe guinnes
<Rommulus> I am good Klumzeedragon, just drawing and felt like talking to everypony
*Ninny hugs Phase4 back. ;_;
*Phase4 hugs Ninjazz "who's a cute irc-goer, yes you are :3"
<MadSurge> Phase4: :D Ikr
<Malavolent> Wrek: Whoa now, you're drinking Czech beer?
<Ninjazz> Ggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
<Phase4> why it ping to ninjaz
<Wrek> 05not right now
<Wrek> 05but i usualyl do
<Malavolent> Wrek: How does it taste?
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Nah. :P It's all I got right now.
<Ninjazz> Lolwat. Ninjazz still exists somehere.
<pony82952> Oh wow.
<pony82952> This is amamzing.
<Wrek> 05nothing sates my thirst like a proper cold beer of eitehr of those 3 brands
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: Well that's good. :) What are you drawing?
<pony82952> I liked Ninny more.
<Malavolent> Wrek: Good for you. I haven't found beer that would taste good to me yet.
<MadSurge> It is the quenchiest!
<Rommulus> My friend requested a D&D symbol for their group so I volunteered to do it for them.
<Wrek> 05Malavolent: try mariestad
<Wrek> 05its bitter enough but still a good sweet light beer
<Wrek> 05what is Ninjazz?
<Gold_Demona> I may have to try and find taht one. My hubby and I usually drink Yeungling
<Malavolent> Wrek: I'm not really sure if they sell it anywhere nearby.
<Gold_Demona> that*
<Ninjazz> Ninjazz is just having client issues.
<Wrek> 05Malavolent: ofc not
<Wrek> 05you'd have to import it
<Ninjazz> And metal ofc.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Oh? I don't think I've had either of the first two. I've many had european beers like Pirat and Gulden Drack. But when I don't have access to those, I drink Heffeweisen. :D
<Wrek> 05tuborg is all rigth aswell
<Wrek> 05though for an everyday like
<Wrek> 05dinenr beer
<Wrek> 05Spendrups is good
<BronyInstrumental> i have no take on this topic, as i've never tasted alcohol, apart from maybe in foods, just never straight from the bottle
<XAX> Hot chocolate + Kahlua
<XAX> :|
<Ninjazz> I just do shots of vodka and gin every once and a while.
<Ninjazz> Not too much of a drinker, really.
<Wrek> 05rebull and vodka
<Klumzeedragon> BronyInstrumental: Well thats not a bad thing. :)
<Wrek> 05the sleeziest shot there is
<Wrek> 05but damn does it work
<Gold_Demona> BronyInstrumental. Well, when you cook with an alcoholic beverage, the alcohol tends to evaporate out of it. :P
<Klumzeedragon> XAX: Haven't tried that. :O Just white russians.
<XAX> Lol, sleezy.
<Buytoast> alcohol tastes like piss anyways
<Ninjazz> Just crappy beer.
<Wrek> 05Buytoast: well duh
<XAX> Klumzeedragon: It ends up tasting like regular hot chocolate with a caramel aftertaste.
<Wrek> 05thats why youtake it properly
<Wrek> 05liek a GOOD beer
<Wrek> 05or a GOOD drink
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Yeah. That or jager and redbull. That's pretty sleezy too.
<Gold_Demona> I find that drinks like beer and wine are best had accompanied with food
<Wrek> 05never liked jägermeister
<Wrek> 05also: http://gronahuset.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/mariestads.jpg
<Gold_Demona> Whereas liquors and mixes of such can be had on their own
<pony_9995> I can't drink alcohol. Just the smell of it gives me a headache.
<Gold_Demona> I like Goldschlagger (sp?)
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: I only drink it as a jager bomb. It's not something to just drink by itself and enjoy. :D
<Gold_Demona> I don't remember what Jager tastes like. Been too long.
<Klumzeedragon> XAX: Oh? Still sounds yummy. :) Thanks for the idea.
<Phase4> my brothers ipod is locked for about 22,000,000 minutes
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Thick... syrupy... black licorice.
<XAX> Phase4: Legend.
<Phase4> which is about 0.7 years
<AdamTheDuck_> Phase4, lolwut :D
<Phase4> he'll be waiting for a while
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: Hmm... Don't remember having anything like that. Maybe I was too drunk to notice when I had it. Cuz I do remember having it at least once
<XAX> Phase4: How on earth...
<Gold_Demona> I used to drink a LOT back in my late teens/early twenties
<pony_9995> Food cooked with alcohol however... burns my stomach.
<Phase4> its ~ 254 days so probably an overflow
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: It was probably mixed with something. Its not usually something people drink straight. Or really do plain shot of.
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: I didn't used to mix drinks back then. I drank everything straight
<MLP_Brovakiin> Phase4 He could just connect it to itunes
<Phase4> 22429288 minutes to be precise
<Gold_Demona> I mix my drinks now because I'm a lot more responsible with the amount I consume. XP
<BronyInstrumental> drummers aren't musicians, they're percussionists
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: That's crazy. I can't drink many things straight. Just Whiskey, Rum, and some Vodkas. Usually if it's flavoured. :D
<Gold_Demona> BronyInstrumental: Who says percussion isn't music? O_o
<Ninjazz> My brother takes offence to that, BronyInstrumental.
<BronyInstrumental> Gold_Demona: my dad, basically
<Mutterguy> I mix my drinks because all we have is beer, wine a little bit of brandy and brandy is too expensive
<BronyInstrumental> Ninjazz: good for him
<Ninjazz> Eh. He can deal with it.
<BronyInstrumental> what's the name of the guy who hangs with the musicians backstage at concerts? the drummer
<Gold_Demona> Klumzeedragon: Well, trying the drinks straight comes in handy when experimenting with mixing. You know what everything tastes like on their own. :P
<Ninjazz> But he did say "fawk you".
<Phase4> BronyInstrumental, wiki redirects from percussionists to percussion instruments, so it either agrees or disagrees. either way it considers them unimportant
<Klumzeedragon> Mutterguy: I hope it's decent Brandy. :S And not like... cooking brandy. I know a few people who drink the bottom shelf cooking stuff.
<BronyInstrumental> Phase4: as they are
<Gold_Demona> I've heard several chefs say "never cook with a wine you wouldn't drink"
<Mutterguy> No idea. probably real. not like I drink that much
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, o_O
<Phase4> that just seems logical
<Phase4> if you cant drink something why would you use it as an ingredient
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Exactly. Cooking wine is pointless. Just use REAL wine.
<Phase4> the crap is cooking wine?
<Ninjazz> Wait. There's actual cooking wine?
<Ninjazz> Like wine. For cooking?
<Gold_Demona> Yes
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: I suppose that's true. I'll probably have to do it more often than I do. :P
<Ninjazz> Wut.
<Phase4> why is that a market that exists
<Mutterguy> because fermented grape juice is a flavour.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Phase4: It's pretty much a low end brandy.
<BronyInstrumental> ah crap, i just remembered i have homework to do for tomorrow
<Wrek> 05always remember
<Wrek> 05those fallen soldiers
<Phase4> i meen cooking chocolate i can understand (it actually comes out nice after being heated) but cooking wine o_O
<Wrek> 05alwasy remember fatehrs and sons of war
<Wrek> 05love this song
<Mutterguy> In risotto and sauces
<Ninjazz> Sons of War.
<Ninjazz> yesh.
<Gold_Demona> I've seen beer used to cook poultry.
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, I don't think I'd skip my standards like that.
<Gold_Demona> Like whole chickens and turkeys.
<Ninjazz> "Cooking Wine". No, just brand it low quality brandy plz.
<Phase4> the whole point of using wine as an ingredient is for the freking wine
<Phase4> BACK TO SCHOOL WORK
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Wine is actually a very good cooking ingredient.
<Phase4> the worlds stupid can wait
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: So long as you use REAL wine and not "cooking wine"
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: I know I wouldnt. :D But there is one dish my parents make with some brandy and it's amazing, but probably cause there isnt much that goes in. But if you tried drinking it by itself, yeesh.
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, i know, had food prepared with it before, was real nice
<Phase4> still cant enjoy wine though, alcohol tastes like absolute crap to me
<Ninjazz> Still need to explore the cooking world a bit.
<AdamTheDuck> "There are two things that are infinite; the expanding universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the universe"
<Phase4> ^
<Ninjazz> Eating dishes with specially prepared wines and stuffs like that.
<Ninjazz> Lol, AdamTheDuck.
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Yeah, wine is an acquired taste. My hubby and I usually enjoy a bottle of wine together with a plate of pasta.
<Gold_Demona> I find that wine is best enjoyed with a meal
<XAX> Well I have a bottle opener that is also a USB drive. So... yeah.
<Phase4> XAX, because why not
<AdamTheDuck> Think Albert Einstein said that, not sure though. Too many random quotes in my bank of quote laying around my head. :3
<Wrek> 05Gold_Demona: a cream based pasta sauce with parseli and fresh pasta~
<Gold_Demona> I can't drink wine by itself. It's just nasty without any food to accompany it
<Klumzeedragon> Eesh. 5:30am. :P Time to hit the hay.
<Mutterguy> I stick with cider
<AdamTheDuck> Night Klumzeedragon
<BronyInstrumental> night Klumzeedragon
<Wrek> 05with parmesan cheese on top of it
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Klumzeedragon
<Ninjazz> Sleep well, Klumzeedragon.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Hmm. We've never done that one before. Usually it's a red wind with red-sauce pasta.
<Wrek> 05adn you eat it with eitehr ox fille or pock fille
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Thanks for the stream man. :) It's been awesome as usual.
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: That sounds awesome. :D
<Ninjazz> And now I'm hungry again.

<XAX> :, not ;
<XAX> Silly mess
<Wrek> 05but yeah Gold_Demona: i can try and compile the recepie for you sometime
<Ninjazz> :kickcount otakon
<BerryPunch> Ninjazz: otakon has been kicked 11 times
<Ninjazz> Oh whoa.
<Ninjazz> Fancy bots.
<Sumica> 00,10mind you that is just BerryPunch's kicks
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Sounds great. I love trying new recipes. :D
<Ninjazz> Ahahaha. I see.
<Sumica> 00,10she would have a better tally if wrek and I removed our bots
<Phase4> Sumica, yeah, you guys and your more sensative kickscripts
<mentallyeffedguy> i dont get you guys some times... you are friendly and nice then suddenly because someone are joking, they get banned, not fukin funny you know
<Wrek> 05thoguh the gates of hell, as we make our way to ehaven, through the nazi lines. Primo Victoria.
<Phase4> inb4 spellcheck
<Ninjazz> Must be atleast 1k by this point atleast.
<Sumica> 00,10not more sensative, just faster
<XAX> mentallyeffedguy: :|
<Ninjazz> mentallyeffedguy, rules, man.
<Ninjazz> Read them.
<killerpony7733> mentallyeffedguy not joking the user who is only one mistake more for a perma ban has made several mistakes over and over again
<Phase4> Sumica, no, more sensetive, mines acurate to +-10ms ignoring network lag
<Ninjazz> Also, it's a given NOT to be dick.
<Phase4> thats a bullshit number based of how long i think it spends processing
<Sumica> 00,10the distance lag is why she misses
<mentallyeffedguy> where im from, when you make a joke people laugh.
<Phase4> actually BerryPunch is in the US now
<Sumica> 00,10oh
<Phase4> ~40ms to the nearest ponychat server
<Sumica> 00,10how odd.
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Ya gotta know when to make what jokes, man.
<Sumica> 00,10she should be faster
<Phase4> mine works to miliseconds, yours work to seconds, theres a 500 or 999ms window yours runs in that mine wont (depending on rounding)
<Ninjazz> :kickcount Ninjazz
<BerryPunch> Ninjazz: Ninjazz has been kicked 0 times
<Ninjazz> yay.
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<Phase4> Sumica, your using mirc right?
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: The key to getting laughs is timing.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Sylandest> :kickcount Sylandest
<BerryPunch> Sylandest: Sylandest has been kicked 0 times
<Sylandest> woo!
<Wrek> 05mentallyeffedguy: actually. here i am tyring to deal with a user behaving like a twat. i make an mistake due to a faulty timer adn amit it. adn act accordinly. in such a situation i do not like being mocked. which even if you were joking your commetn could be read as. now with that im mind, can you see why?
<Phase4> yeah, mirc kickscripts i've seen are acurate to a second
<Wrek> 05as for the rest of you stop arguign with him about it
<Wrek> 05jeez
<Phase4> Sumica, as for the delay in kicks, thats probably due to the bots rate limiting
<Gold_Demona> Sorry :<
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: when the jokes are on you, you get angry?
*AdamTheDuck hugs Wrek
<AdamTheDuck> Hug the angst out
<AdamTheDuck> All the angst.
<Phase4> we were arguing? i'm sorry :(
<Ninjazz> No, Flutters!
<Gold_Demona> ^
<Ninjazz> I will not forgive you. :T
<Wrek> 05what? no. when you come off as mockign me i get angry
<Wrek> 05which is what you did
<Wrek> 05had it come off as a joke then i couldnt have cared less
<killerpony7733> mentallyeffedguy a good idea would be to stop now before you dig yourself into a hole.
<Alchemist> hmm, someone pledged 4000$ for the hey ocean world tour. Where do people get this much money?
<mentallyeffedguy> you guys can argue about anything cant you?
<Mutterguy> credit card debt?
<Alchemist> dunno, but I sure could use even a fraction of that
<Ninjazz> We can pretty much argue about things we like.
<Ninjazz> Like best pony arguements.
<Ninjazz> And worst pony arguments.
<Ninjazz> Those are always /fun/.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Dark_Horst> mentallyeffedguy: you realise that'S what you're doing?
<killerpony7733> ^
<Alchemist> Wanto to argue? Mention religion and politics and you'll never see the end of it.
<BronyInstrumental> dear "lol", thank you for being there when i have nothing else to say
<Gold_Demona> ^
<mentallyeffedguy> Dark_Horst: im just playing along here :)'
<BronyInstrumental> dear "rofl" thank you for being there when "lol" doesn't cut it
<Ninjazz> Dear "heh, you do a fine job when all else fails.
<MadSurge> Watching an art stream, got a cutesy blog for y'all :D
<Gold_Demona> dear "lmfao" thank you for being there when even "rofl" isn't enough

<Ninjazz> Seems people's has been somewhat good for once.
<Serenity> What#s the count?
<Alchemist> I wonder what the is the leading cause of botkicks. Flooding maybe?
<Ninjazz> Spamcounter, probably, Alchemist.
<Serenity> Probably for calling Sumica nice ^^
<killerpony7733> Wrek well tribes ascend maybe?
<killerpony7733> Wouldn
<killerpony7733> wouldn't mind that*
<Alchemist> [old man voice] In my time they used to call it flooding. [/oldmanvoice]

<Serenity> 0.1/1.6gb done. Woo
<Ninjazz> Sumica, I didn't also remember that it's your personal counter. I was thinking it was a total of every mod's count.

<AdamTheDuck> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<mentallyeffedguy> ok
<mentallyeffedguy> thats a handy thing :)
<Ninjazz> Sure is.
<Ninjazz> I remember the days when it actually did something useful.
<Ninjazz> Ah S2. You were fun.
<Serenity> It's still useful
<Serenity> It's useful in telling you that it has no idea
<Ninjazz> I'm informed! :D
<mentallyeffedguy> so it usually just tells you that its unknown?
<Sylandest> yep
<Ninjazz> Until we get the real time and date for the show.
<Sylandest> until the season gets started
<Ninjazz> Which we don't even have a specific date.
<Kencolt> OK... this looks like Doom-- original Doom-- with updated graphics and slightly different mechanics. So... what is it?
<Serenity> Doom 3 I *think*
<Ninjazz> Doom with update graphics and slightly different mechanics, Kencolt. :p
<MadSurge> :D SO ANGRY
<mentallyeffedguy> doom 3 is on xbox i think
<Serenity> MadSurge: Well, you ARE called Mad surge
<AdamTheDuck> I don't think this is Doom 3
<Serenity> Okay then
<Serenity> I did say I think :P

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Deus Vult 2 is million times worse
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I imagine, since this isn't the last level.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Final level's always the worst.
<cachi01|phone> Not always.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also, secret levels
<Gold_Demona> Ah yes, secret levels. Can't forget those
<SafariMonkey> this is the first level of this part

<Gold_Demona> How ya doin' Pearly? =)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D Wolfenstein 3D nostalgia level
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes, I love that level. ^^
<cachi01|phone> Lol robot hitler
<Gold_Demona> Wolfenstein 3D was awesome. =)
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: DIE, ALLIED SCHWEINHUND
<Jmo> Wolfenstein 3D is the bomb.
<Gold_Demona> I loved finding all the hidden doors in that game.
<Gold_Demona> Hug the wall and spam spacebar. XD
<Jmo> Makes me cry when people ask what it is. ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: IKR?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Yep :D
<BronyInstrumental> i know what wolfenstein is but i didn't know there was a wolfenstein 3d
<Dovah> Jmo: what is it? :D
*Pearly yawns "just woke up, how are you doin darlin?"
*Pearly snuggles Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> The same logic doesn't work as well in Doom2, but I DID find some interesting goodies that way. Like the Wolfenstein level
*Jmo slaps Dovah around a bit with a large trout
*Dovah is immune to larg trouts, and slapping.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Jmo: How many large trouts do you own?
<Pearly> ahh the best 3d realm game
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: Nothin much. Just hanging out whilst I draw in my other computer.
<SafariMonkey> *Minecraft water!*
<Jmo> Lots MLP_Brovakiin.
<MadSurge> BronyInstrumental: Wolfenstein 3D was the real name. Before that there was Return to Castle Wolfenstein, which was more of a stealth game
*Pearly snuggles close and watches
<BronyInstrumental> MadSurge: oh okay. i just call it wolfenstein cause it was 3D regardless :$
<MadSurge> Yeah :D
<cachi01|phone> Sooo guys is the wolfenstein for ps3/xbox/pc any good?
<cachi01|phone> The newest one
*MLP_Brovakiin snuggles with Pearly :3
<Gold_Demona> I have no idea
<Gold_Demona> I'm often paranoid about reboots of old forgotten games
*Pearly snuggles with MLP_Brovakiin
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah :(
<Pearly> cachi01|phone, from what I saw it did... looks like doom 3
<Pearly> doom 3 will be remastered
<SafariMonkey> Which difficulty is this?
<Pearly> I can't wait
<Gold_Demona> I am interested on how the King's Quest reboot will turn out though.
<cachi01|phone> Pearly ikr
<Pearly> so I can play doom 2
<Pearly> that is the only reason
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the fanmade remakes are pretty good
<cachi01|phone> E.T videogame reboot
<Pearly> they are redoing ALL of kings quest?
<cachi01|phone> Will it happen?
<SafariMonkey> cachi01|phone: NO!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: TellTale games is making the new King's Quest game
<Alchemist> will someone stream a speedrun of either doom 1 or 2? Its outraging.
<Kinixys> King's Quest 12 or 13 or something?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Then we're on good hands :D
<Pearly> *ahem* how about a reboot of romance of the kingdom
<Gold_Demona> And TellTale makes pretty good games from what I've seen, so it should be interesting
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Dovah> reboot of ghosts and goblins?
<Pearly> that and kings quest was the longest games ever
<Gold_Demona> At any rate they did a really good job with the Back to the Future game
<cachi01|phone> it was meh
<Gold_Demona> I love the Kings Quest series. It had a really fun story to it
<Gold_Demona> Also Space Quest.
<Pearly> not sure if capcom would want to ewdo that
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, KQ was good
<Gold_Demona> Wasn't Ghosts and Goblins like CRAZY hard?
<cachi01|phone> But the walking dead is awesome
<MadSurge> Space Quest was the one with the most contempt for the gamer :D
<Pearly> Yes it was
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: yes, I loved that. XD
<Gold_Demona> And I loved how in Space Quest, the hero accidently saves the universe multiple times. :P
<MadSurge> And the deaths were hilarious for that :D
<cachi01|phone> Dammit i need to play that game
<Gold_Demona> My favorite was in Space Quest 2, where he got ground into grade D hamburger
<SafariMonkey> Anyone know what difficulty this is on?
<Gold_Demona> If you waited too ,ong to get off the conveyer belt and wind up falling into the gears. :P
<Gold_Demona> too long*
<Phase4> sleep time
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and a *CENSORED* bar appeared :D
<Gold_Demona> Back when you had to type in what you wanted the character to do. lol XD

<Gold_Demona> lol, No WONDER Roger Wilco's a virgin. XD
<Pearly> I wanted to play the game that Tom Hawks played in BIG
<MadSurge> I remember in a Freelance Astronauts video they told the character to do something "for the love of God"
<poniesareweird> hello
<cachi01|phone> hi poniesareweird :)
<Pearly> hey poniesareweird
<MadSurge> The game replied "I don't understand God" :D
<cachi01|phone> U new here?
<Lil_B> in Space quest 2, when you get brought down onto the planet and the hovercraft goes down, you can type "fuck corpse" or "rape corpse" (I forgot) and you will get an angry messege from the developers XD

<cachi01|phone> Slenderman*

<MLP_Brovakiin> ^

<Lil_B> Maid_RainBow (\
<Dovah> cachi01|phone: no but she can make him gigle
<Lil_B> MadSurge "put gem in mouth"
<cachi01|phone> Dovah...... Slendy has no feelings
<MadSurge> Lil_B: SAME :D
<cachi01|phone> Dovah slendy has no mercy
<Lil_B> MadSurge tell that the game :P
<Dovah> cachi01|phone: brb :|
<cachi01|phone> Dovah that picture is fake
<MadSurge> Lil_B: which game?
<Lil_B> MadSurge the game you just lost...
<cachi01|phone> Dovah IRL she would have escaped
<MadSurge> Lil_B: ANSWER
<Lil_B> MadSurge Space Quest 2 :P
<Dovah> cachi01|phone: what picture?
<cachi01|phone> Dovah the one u were going to.bring
<Dovah> cachi01|phone: 0.o
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone oh, and do yourself a favour (the same holds true for all Sierras Adventure Games) "Safe Early, Safe often"
<SafariMonkey> Safe?
<Lil_B> save*
<SafariMonkey> :)
<Lil_B> I always confuse safe and save
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B lol ok. I guess multiple endings right?
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: they come from the same route
<Lil_B> at least I got than and then down now
<SafariMonkey> *root
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: You a native english speaker?
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone nope, You gonna die that way or the other so just please save often
<Gold_Demona> cachi01|phone: There's technically only one to any of the Space Quest games. Also only one true solution. If you count the hundreds of ways you can die, there are several endings. :P
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey nope, I'm german
<MLP_Brovakiin> Wow I have just picked up everything I own in skyrim to move it and it all weighs 5000+ jeez i should go on that 'hoarders' program :P
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: more like "the dev liked to put in dick moves and you might have missed a vital item in the prologue that you need in the end" :D
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: for someone who doesn't speak native english, you speak it pretty damn well :)
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B Gold_Demona Madsurge ok thx lol
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: you made skyrim referacne, You dun Goof'd
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental thanks :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: Why?
<BronyInstrumental> i've been doing german for 3 years and i'm no good at it :$
<Gold_Demona> I watched a lets play series on YouTube of all the Space Quest and King's Quest games played by a Swedish guy who basically learned English playing these games, lol.
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: you just DID thats why!
<cachi01|phone> Dovah....... 9gag.com/gag/5166730
<cachi01|phone> YEAH 9FAG LINK DEAL WITH IT
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone yeah... what MadSurge said XD or the other way around, example: A unstable material you pick up at some point may explode somewhere else when you have to jump down somehwere :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: Thats a bit ironic, considering that your name is dovah and all :P
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: Your skyrim speaks is reminding me I cant get the dlc for like 8 more hours!!!
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: Very good. I realised as safe/save isn't the type of thing native english speakers have trouble with, but otherwise I wouldn't have known. Good job!
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B ok this game sounds so fricking hilarious
<MadSurge> Lil_B: and you can't go back to put it back down! :D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: You jelly :D
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone it is, it's worth to get killed just to see the dialoge XD
<cachi01|phone> Like Mcpixel! Where every shit explodes without a reason!
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: I will eat you :|
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: COME AT ME BRO :P
*Dovah eats MLP_Brovakiin
<Lil_B> MadSurge well, I think in the fanremake you can get a bunny or something, put it in there, and throw it to the big plant so it explodes
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: english is my second language too.
<Jmo> You monster Dovah.
*MLP_Brovakiin cuts his way out of Dovah's belly
<Gold_Demona> It's especially fun in Space Quests 4 and 6, which both have voice acting in them, including Gary Owens as the narrator. XD
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey thanks, where are you from?
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: 1 question i have tho, can you buy land anywhere you want or are there set locations?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: in the original it was just "pick it up, put it back down, get points" :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge "Blow nose" worth like 100 points in one of those games :/
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: well, technically. I used to live in Senegal, west Africa
<MadSurge> Lil_B: "pick nose" in the Quest for Glory games :D
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey oh, sounds nice, where do you live now?
<Gold_Demona> I loved the taste button in Space Quest 4.
<Lil_B> MadSurge XD
<Gold_Demona> Or was it 3?
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: My dad is native british though, now I live in Cornwall
<Gold_Demona> You could lick random objects. :3
<Gold_Demona> And you'd get a message on how it tastes
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dovah: You can buy only 3 plots of land, one in the Pale, one in Falkreath and one in Hjalmarch, You get a letter about them sometime after you download the DLC
<MadSurge> YUM Gold_Demona :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge I actually haven't played any of those, I only saw Space quest 2 and 3 and Leisure Suite Larry 1-3 on LordKats Stream
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: 4 years now
<MadSurge> MUTATED
<BronyInstrumental> i'm native british, english to be exact :3
<Lil_B> SafariMonkey is that in england?
<Dovah> MLP_Brovakiin: I see.
<Gold_Demona> I think it was 4, cuz I think I remember the narrator telling you how things tasted
<cachi01|phone> SafariMonkey u live in south africa? Have u ever went to equestria? I mean the real one
<SafariMonkey> Lil_B: yeah, but don't tell that to the locals. :P
<Gold_Demona> You could lick things like the street and the wall. :P
<SafariMonkey> cachi01|phone: *West* Africa
<Gold_Demona> There was no practical purpose for the taste function other than "for shits and giggles"
<cachi01|phone> Oh
<SafariMonkey> I did say. :P
<Lil_B> btw, the "2 Guys from Andromeda" made a Kickstarter shortly after Schäfer started his and they said, that the narrator from SQ4 will be there again :)

<MadSurge> Wrek: Nightmare is a practical joke
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Pretty good. How about you? :)
<BronyInstrumental> cachi01|phone: yeah, but west and south aren't opposites
<Lil_B> I think west Africa was one of the very few german colonies before WW1 ... but I'm not entirely sure
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: I am fine thank you :)
<Gold_Demona> I never play nightmare, cuz you can't use cheats in that mode. And I'm a wimpy noob who can't play Doom without god mode. :<
<Wrek> 05Gold_Demona: aaw is ok ^_^
<Wrek> 05though ive played doom on and off since i was 3
<SafariMonkey> BronyInstrumental: No, it's that whenever I tell someone I'm from west africa, they assume I mean south
<Wrek> 05so :|
<Vivix> Wham!
<Wrek> 05i guess i love knowing a game in and out
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Me too. :P

<BronyInstrumental> hia Vivix :P
<SafariMonkey> isn't nightmare double ammo?
<Wrek> 05doom 3 is a different kind of game entirely

<HoodyNinja> gamecube was my favorite console ever
<Lil_B> N64, Wii and GBC ... maby buying an normal GB in big grey
<HoodyNinja> I just noticed this, but it seems most of us here are gamers
<Vivix> I mainly use PC, as such I don't really know any classic console games
<cachi01|phone> Venhur i have nes, snes, n64, ps1, 2, and 3, xbox 360 S, wii, all the DS, a gameboy Advance, and a ps vita
<cachi01|phone> Except the XL Ds
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: NNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERD!
<Gold_Demona> I grew up on both console and PC, but I haven't been interested in any consoles after the GameCube and PS2
<cachi01|phone> XD
<VenHur> Same here, because it was the first console I played back in the early 2000s, when I was um... 5 or 6 year old.
<VenHur> I don't know, I sucks at remembering sometimes.
<BronyInstrumental> Gold_Demona: same, the only console game i play regularly now is FFX, and that's just cause it's fun as hell to play
<Vivix> First console I had was PS2, but I only really played GTASA on it
<HoodyNinja> My mom kicked my ass at snes mariokart
<Vivix> well- very first console was Sega something, but I can't remember much of the gamees
<cachi01|phone> BronyInstrumental wait till u get the AHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Scene.....
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Yeah, when you have a good PC you don't need console
<BronyInstrumental> cachi01|phone: oh, i have
<VenHur> But I do know that some of the earliest game I played was Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Mario Sunshine, and Simpsons Road Rage.
<cachi01|phone> Vivix genesis?
<BronyInstrumental> cachi01|phone: i've cleared it, 100%
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: Especially when all the good console games are also available on PC
<Vivix> mmaybe, I have the controller here-
<Lil_B> I I had the Money I would buy a NES + SNES immidietly XD but that will have to wait
<BronyInstrumental> my first console was the sega megadrive, and i only ever played "sonic the hedgehog" on it
<Vivix> Sega Mega Drive
<cachi01|phone> I want a dreamcast and a genesis
*HoodyNinja can't find old nintendo consoles anywhere
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer Melee over Brawl in terms of controls.
<VenHur> I remember how they advertise the system. "GENESIS DOES WHAT NINTENDON'T".
<cachi01|phone> Vivix its a genesis plug in lol
<SafariMonkey> Gold_Demona: Only thing I miss is multiplayer with my console friends
<Vivix> but it was just one machine-
<Vivix> mom bought it down the street when I was a kid
<MadSurge> VenHur: still better than the Jaguar :D
*AJIsAwesome only has a Sega Genesis controller, but no Sega Genesis. :D
<cachi01|phone> VenHur XDDD James rolfe made a video when he was a kid about that
<Vivix> we played..sonic and some..platform game
<Gold_Demona> SafariMonkey: I didn't do a whole lot of multiplayer... Still don't. Almost all my games have been single-player
<cachi01|phone> The one about a little star.... Running aroubd getting more stars....
<cachi01|phone> What was its name?
*HoodyNinja remembers console multiplayer
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: Ristar?
<HoodyNinja> Ah, good times
<Pinkie-Pie3175> :)
<cachi01|phone> Yeah ristar lol
<VenHur> MadSurge: Yeeaah, is it me, or does Atari always sucks when it comes to thier consoles?
<Gold_Demona> Man, on my Genesis I had a LOT of Disney games. It was ridiculous how many Disney games I had
<Vivix> Sega Genesis = sega mega drive in europe
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge yeah that one lol
<Vivix> so that clears that up-
*HoodyNinja sigh
<VenHur> I mean, they ALMOST destroyed video games forever back in the video game crash of 1983 or 1982 I think.
<HoodyNinja> I have to go
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: if I'm correct it was the Sonic prototype game
<MadSurge> VenHur: Ikr
<HoodyNinja> Next period is starting, goodbye people
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Bye. :(
<VenHur> But then came Mario...god, imagine what's the world is like if it wasn't for Mario.
<Vivix> byaa
<Lil_B> bye HoodyNinja
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge well it does looks and plays like a sonic game. And the stages are very similiar
<MadSurge> VenHur: Nintendo saved american gaming back then
<Gold_Demona> Mario saved video games... The same way Pok?mon saved the Gameboy
<Vivix> so yeah first console I got was a Sega Genesis(mega drive in europe) and after that nothing until PS2, but my mom had some nintendos I played now and then
<AJIsAwesome> Which do you prefer: Pocket Monsters or Pokemon?
<cachi01|phone> Im playing pokemon crystal roght now
<cachi01|phone> Right*
<Vivix> If it hadn't been for mario, adventure games might have been top10 now
*CreeperPillow LOVES the songs from the Minecraft Alpha album
*AJIsAwesome didn't beat his Pokemon Yellow until this year. :D
<sonicandmario85> hello :3

<Ravebrony> :D
<cachi01|phone> Oooooh mode seven is what allowed the SNES to have the 3D capability
<Ravebrony> That was great
<Lil_B> I loved the Effect in "Terranigma"

<sonicandmario85> tSparx:he probaly switched it back

<tSparx> sonicandmario85: I just heard Sumica's normal ping though >_> I'm hearing like the default windows *beep*
<Pearly> hahah mig mac is funy as always
<Pearly> big

<Sumica> 00,10just in time
<tSparx> Sumica: dat pun
<VenHur> Sumica: Oh you and your silly puns.
<SafariMonkey> Whenever I think of doctor who, I think of 10 or 11, even for 9's stories
<Zawan> only this episode showed today?
<tSparx> SafariMonkey: I usually don't mix up the doctor's, but I was surprised to discover that the badwolf subplot (or really metaplot I guess) was Eccelston and not Tennant. Mind is a fickle thing.
<Pearly> AJIsAwesome_, everyone has to be a flippin critic on what one likes and don't like
<Sumica> 00,10rose tyler, you done fucked up
<tSparx> I remembered all the actual episode story's being with 9, but I forgot that they were tied to the badwolf plot :$
<AJIsAwesome_> Pearly: Ikr?
<alexxm> of course it's your fault
<AJIsAwesome_> Rose dun goofed. :D
<DoctoDocorWho> Sumica: oniichan?
<Zawan> oh and has badwolf been mentioned yet? and if so how many times
<CreeperPillow> AJIsAwesome_: Consequences will never be the same
<VenHur> ROSE, THIS IS YOUR FAULT, IF YOU HAVEN'T SAVED YOUR FATHER, WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS PARADOX!
<tSparx> Zawan: Badwolf's hinted at at least once every ep. in ssn. 1
<Sumica> 00,10time to feed
<Pearly> least I am gettng back to watching cartoons
<AJIsAwesome_> I just realized that I 'm wearing a "Doctor Whooves" shirt and watching Doctor Who.
<Pearly> haha AJIsAwesome_
<tSparx> Pearly: I LUFF cartoons :)
<tSparx> This is one of my favorite quotes!
<DoctoDocorWho> AJIsAwesome_: they have shirts?!?!
<Pearly> I am just a cartoon nut
<Pearly> DoctoDocorWho, yes
<VenHur> Same here.
<AJIsAwesome_> DoctoDocorWho: Hot Topic, my friend.
<tSparx> Pearly: That means you're gonna get eaten by a cartoon squirrel :$
<Pearly> wished hot topic had them LARGER sizes
<Gold_Demona> Doesn't We Love Fine have a Whooves shirt?
<tSparx> dat awkward question
<AJIsAwesome_> Gold_Demona: Yep.
<Gold_Demona> With the tardis and the weeping pegasi
<DoctoDocorWho> *takes off sunglasses to reveal another pair of identical sunglasses* Bloddy hell,
<VenHur> Cartoons are kind of good now actually, we got [obviously] Ponies, Gravity Falls, Phineas and Ferb...
<Sumica> 00,10which whooves
<AJIsAwesome_> Gold_Demona: Oh. Then I'm not sure.
<MLP_Brovakiin> he gone white as a skeleton literally
<Sumica> 00,10young micky
<sonicandmario85> VenHur:and adventure time
<AJIsAwesome_> I'm sick of Phineas and Ferb, in my opinion. :S
<Pearly> VenHur, yeah
<Pearly> the hub has g1 of transformers
<DoctoDocorWho> Bloody*
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome_ same here
<Pearly> I grew upliking HB cartoons
<sonicandmario85> Jake the dog and Finn the human
<Pearly> I met HB
<VenHur> I like HB cartoons too.
<cachi01|phone> VenHur phineas and ferb is the same thing every episode...
<Sumica> 00,10a bigger paradox
<Gold_Demona> 9 is blunt. :P
<sonicandmario85> cachi01|phone because it doesnt have much episodes
<Pearly> I dislike those who says that MLP FIM is "for girls"
<cachi01|phone> HB cartoons are epic
<tSparx> YOU travel through time for weeks without any prior experience, see how stupid YOU get.
<Pearly> hahahaa pinkie pie "yes sir, ma'am sir" haha
<tSparx> Pearly: FiM was targeted for girls, but made for EVERYONE :)
<Pearly> I am using that for now on
<XylemTube> oH LOOK! Dr. Who
<VenHur> cachi01|phone: It doesn't matter about the repeative plots, the writing's still good and the songs are fun.
<DoctoDocorWho> #1 rule of time travel: TOUCH. NOTHING.
<Pearly> tSparx, then why can't people KNOW that?
<Gold_Demona> I love Phineas and Ferb's formulaic style, personally.
<sonicandmario85> suddenly buffer
<tSparx> Pearly: Because people don't want to learn, they just want to know <_<
<AJIsAwesome_> VenHur: It's not that, it's just that people I knew were fanatics ad kept shoving the show down my throat.
<DoctoDocorWho> thats the tardis?
<AJIsAwesome_> *and*
<cachi01|phone> VenHur...... The songs annoy me lol and the writing? Dude its just HEY I KNOW WHAT WE R GOING TO DO HEY WHERES PERRY?
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: Because people think "targeted to" and "made for" are the same thing.
<VenHur> Pearly: Why can't no one understands that MLP FIM is a show for MAINLY MENS WITH MUSTACHES AND BEARDS!
<cachi01|phone> Then the invention disdapears
<cachi01|phone> Ss*
<Pearly> Ponyville confidential I learned alot form just one episode
<XylemTube> VenHur: I do have a beard...
<Wirisme> Same here
<cachi01|phone> I do have a moustache....
<Sumica> 00,10the thing is smart production studios realise that parents often watch shows with their kids
<tSparx> I've got a scraggly little goatee :)
<DoctorWhoovesV10> hello everypony
<sonicandmario85> VenHur:wel...its for little girls too
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, Tell then my friend this
<Sumica> 00,10it may be targeted to kids but if they make it so adults can enjoy it as well

<tSparx> CreeperPillow: I *personally* wouldn't bother with the old ones, but that's just me.
<DoctorWhoovesV10> i remember that it hurt like hell
<CreeperPillow> tSparx: Okay then.
<VenHur> tSparx: Start the entire series from "An Unearthly Child" up to the recent episode.
<sonicandmario85> time is now fucked up because of rose
<tSparx> CreeperPillow: They explain all the backstory in the new one, and honestly some of it has changed since the old series
<SafariMonkey> I started on the new series
<Dovah> docto
<VenHur> tSparx: But keep in mind that the older episodes are rare to be found.
<Gold_Demona> Technically you can't start with the old ones cuz most of the old episodes are gone.
<alexxm> tSparx some old episodes are missing as well
<Wirisme> gone?
<CreeperPillow> tSparx: Okay then.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, lost in a fire
<DoctoDocorWho> DoctorWhoovesV10: isnt 9 the one where he gets stranded by a black hole?
<alexxm> as in the BBC lost them
<Wirisme> That's bad
<tSparx> VenHur: Not really, they're either here or lost forever.
<Alchemist> Wirisme: unless someone digitalized it from the 1960's its gone
<Dovah> DoctoDocorWho: ur nick, add a 't' in docor
<VenHur> BBC, WHY YOU NO RELEASE THE COMPLETE SERIES WITH ALL SEVEN DOCTORS?!
<Gold_Demona> lol, that'd involve some time travel I think
<tSparx> VenHur: 'Cause they lost some of them
<AJIsAwesome_> He knows what he has to do
<AJIsAwesome_> :(
<Gold_Demona> Cuz didn't the fire happen before digital was even an option?
<alexxm> VenHur they lost most of the black and white episodes
<tSparx> Scrapped him, actually, threw them away :P
<Sumica> 00,10because they recorded over s11 of who
<Sumica> 00,10er s1
<DoctorWhoovesV10> DoctoDocorWho: no thats10 if you also mean the one were he meets the "devil"

<Buytoast> boy you're an obnoxious little monkey aren't you
<Alchemist> Kencolt: no Rose Tyler is credited at IMDB
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome_: Who, Capt. Jack? Nah! He's like, morally grey at worst.

<AJIsAwesome_> tSparx: I was just joking around. :D
<VenHur> Ooh, next episode!

<Gold_Demona> I love Jack Harkness.
<AJIsAwesome_> sonicandmario85: NETFLIX, I think.

<Kinixys> This a recent episode?
<Buytoast> Slippy Mickey
<MaxTheBrony> nah
<VenHur> No, no it's not.
<SafariMonkey> Kinixys: No, it's pretty early in the new series
<VenHur> This is an episode with the 9th Doctor.
<Sumica> 00,10all the tins of food
<MaxTheBrony> Who was the First doctor?
<MaxTheBrony> Was he best?
<Kinixys> Oh this is season one.
<Wirisme> Damnit now i'm into it and have to watch all the other episodes
<alexxm> super powered nose
<SafariMonkey> first broadcast 21 May 2005
<Kinixys> He was a good doctor.
<cachi01|phone> That bomb sound effect is getting annoying lol
<VenHur> I can't remember the actor's name for the First Doctor, but he was an old man.
<AJIsAwesome_> MaxTheBrony: 4th for old fans; 10th for new fans.
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<Kencolt> The First Doctor was actually a rather elderly man. And often a complete mystery and something of a selfish bastard. He tried NOT to help-- according to his people's laws-- but kept getting involved against his will.
<Kinixys> Christopher Eccleston
<Kencolt> The actor was William Hartnell.
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<DoctoDoctorWho> 3 doctors? Dammit!
<Wirisme> Knew it
<DoctorWhoovesV10> sound of. doctor
<cachi01|phone> Now kiss
<Sumica> 00,10damn you captan jack grabass
<AJIsAwesome_> >Drinking champagne while hearing the various bombings
<MaxTheBrony> dem Cgi
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<AJIsAwesome_> >Totally Romantic
<SpectraClouds> captian jack sparrow is what i always think O_o
<DoctoDoctorWho> Genocide, totally romantic
<XylemTube> ^
<Kencolt> Sumica: Oh, come on. Jack would flirt with himself if he could figure it out.
<cachi01|phone> Yay
<Wirisme> "payment"
<MaxTheBrony> is it week 35 btw?
<VenHur> Hey Sumica, is there's any british actors you knowed that's might be the 12th and final Doctor btw?
<MaxTheBrony> i have homework but i forgot the week xD
<XylemTube> a smooth criminal?
<Kinixys> There can be no final doctor. XD
<DoctorWhoovesV10> death the most romantic thing. bombs dropping everywhere lets dance
<cachi01|phone> Kinixys according to the wiki yes. There can be
<VenHur> Kinixys: Must I reminds you that's the Doctor can regenerate 12 times?
<Wirisme> they can write around that
<Kinixys> They just make this stuff as they go. They'll change it.
<MaxTheBrony> asss?
<MaxTheBrony> mass?
<applejack`> xD
<cachi01|phone> Sooo the doctot has died 11 times?
<cachi01|phone> Doctor*
<SafariMonkey> 10
<VenHur> So far, yes...
<MaxTheBrony> nah he has
<cachi01|phone> LOL
<MaxTheBrony> oh wait yeah
<SafariMonkey> well, 11 because he postponed a regeneration as 10
<AJIsAwesome_> Well, considering the fact that he can REGENERATE 12 times, wouldn't the 13th doctor be the final one?
<DoctorWhoovesV10> its called regenration
<cachi01|phone> He likes dying apparently
<MaxTheBrony> How come he can regenerate by the way?
<MirrorImage> MaxTheBrony - because Plot Armor
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<AJIsAwesome_> MaxTheBrony: Probably has to do with their race.
<Buytoast> wasn't the whole regernation deal just so they could draw out the show?
<MaxTheBrony> Wait what race?
<alexxm> MaxTheBrony he's an alien and it means they can get new actors when the old one quits
<Kencolt> AJIsAwesome_: Proper math that. Meaninf that at least two other actors can play the role-- and then the scriptwriters make something up.
<VenHur> Because he is a Time Lord, MaxTheBrony.
<Kinixys> And have new actors star in it I"m sure.
<SafariMonkey> but he interrupted a regenration, dos that count?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well MaxTheBrony its makes it easier to advance the plot while keeping a person who is supposed to be 900+ years old believable.
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - probably. Makes a good excuse for pulling in a new actor every couple of seasons
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<Gold_Demona> MaxTheBrony: Out of series answer: To give the series an excuse to use a new actor.
<Wirisme> why would they put a limit on it then?
<Barbetos|AtWork> They could not keep making episodes if they used the same guy over and over again.
<MaxTheBrony> :P allright sounds resonable
<DoctorWhoovesV10> time lords forever. 2 hearts and twice the brain power of humans
<Barbetos|AtWork> But its interesting to not that they used this fact as an interesting plot device MaxTheBrony
<Barbetos|AtWork> And that is why Doctor Who is so good
<Gold_Demona> Also an excuse to change the Doctor's personality
<SafariMonkey> You know the first regeneration was what is known as an ass pull
<MaxTheBrony> its pretty smart :)
<Sumica> 00,10the limit is presumed, no one knows
<Kinixys> I'm not a fan, but I imagine they threw in some arbitrary number during an episode a long time ago not really thinking they would get that far?
<Wirisme> I don't believe it!
<AJIsAwesome_> Kencolt: Unless the first was a regeneration, I'm not sure if the 12th will be the last.
<Barbetos|AtWork> This series will probably just end.
<MaxTheBrony> dat sickness
<Kencolt> Kinixys: Precisely. Used to mess with the Master, mostly.
<Barbetos|AtWork> And then continue years later.
<cachi01|phone> What happens if the doctor gets 100 coins? He gets a new life?
<AJIsAwesome_> cachi01|phone: He gets a dollar?
<VenHur> Without H.G Wells's The Time Machine, we wouldn't have Back To The Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and this.
<MaxTheBrony> Dats scar
<MaxTheBrony> scary
<cachi01|phone> Ok what happens if the doctor dies for real?
<Wirisme> game over
<MaxTheBrony> But the masks?
<MaxTheBrony> explain the masks :O
<Barbetos|AtWork> cachi01|phone: last episode we got a glimpse of it.
<VenHur> cachi01|phone: If the possible 12th Doctor dies, then the series is over...
<alexxm> they live
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ill just beat death in a game of logic and get 12 more lives:)
<Barbetos|AtWork> I don't see this series ever ending
<Kinixys> This is where the tf2 pyro came from. XD JKing.
<Kandarihu> Today, I'm going to finish feeding my mag. I'm so close.
<AJIsAwesome_> Barbetos|AtWork: Well technically, all shows must have an ending.
<SafariMonkey> he is being empted
<Kinixys> Until they are brought back.
<SafariMonkey> *emptied
<Wirisme> creeped out again
<DoctorWhoovesV10> DoctoDoctorWho: :) `brilliant :)
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome tell that to the simpsons
<MaxTheBrony> and when does the mask come?
<Barbetos|AtWork> AJIsAwesome_: Yeah, it may "end" but the idea of the Doctor and its continued showing will not end.
<VenHur> Oh god, he got affected too!
<Flyboy> oh my...
<Buytoast> goddamn

<Sundaysmile> Nostalgia overload!
<CreeperPillow> And my nostalgia, tis leaking
<cachi01|phone> MOUSTACHE
<Kandarihu> Kinixys, if S3 is REALLY going to be 13 episodes long, it'll be over WELL before April 1st.
<CreeperPillow> Speaking of moustache.....
*Kencolt smiles to himself, having BBC America on his cable.
<Bronysith> ALL RIGHTY, time to take pics of my swords i added to my collection over the time of dragoncon
<Sundaysmile> well one each week?
<Sundaysmile> or each sat
<Gold_Demona> lol Maine
<cachi01|phone> MAH BOI
<Sundaysmile> maybe a delay at the chrimbo holidays?
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: But.. but.. s4 5 6 7 8 9?
<MrMalk> Kandarihu those are the only confirmed episodes they could make more
<Spademagnes[R]> I still think Xenosaga is one of the harder RPG's I played
<Vivix> 13 episodes is confirmed
<ekips> This video gave me ADHD
<Spademagnes[R]> 13 that we know of so far
<Wrek> 05a separate studio was confirmed workign on more eps
<Wirisme> didn't they pretty much say 13 episodes total?
<Wrek> 05but we have 13 guaranteed from studio B
<Vivix> I thouht that was the rumour? That 13 was confirmed y the crew
<Sundaysmile> for writing or production?
<cachi01|phone> 13 episodes from studio B
<cachi01|phone> Were confirmed
<Kinixys> Se.. seep.. sperate studio?
<Spademagnes[R]> 13's pretty damn short
<QuinnThePegaSistta> I cant wait untill season 3
<MrMalk> Wirisme no confirmed they will make more
<Sumica> 00,10xenogears was far harder Spademagnes[R]
<cachi01|phone> FROM STUDIO.B
<CreeperPillow> PONY
<MadSurge> PO-NEEE. *Bzzzzzt*
<Kinixys> Seperate!?
<VenHur> 13 Episodes?
<Applejack2012> S3 will be so 20% cool
<Kandarihu> But there is a newly founded studio that's making more episodes, right? Like... a Studio C?
<Sundaysmile> so 26 all in?
<Vivix> I don't think we get more than 13 this season, next we will get normal, but if we get more in s3, woo
<Spademagnes[R]> If I recal Xenosaga Ep 3 had a Xenogears reference in it
<Sumica> 00,10studio B bought out the other studio
<Wirisme> All i can say is they better not end it, I just got here
<Spademagnes[R]> The super boss looks like the main character of xenogears mech
<VenHur> ALL THE MEMES
<CreeperPillow> All the macos
<Dovah> I saw a dark souls ref!
<CreeperPillow> macros*
<Kandarihu> This freezing is getting worse. Time to whine to SEGA about this.
<Applejack2012> All the apples
<alexxm> so many memes
<Sundaysmile> hopefully they bought the right talen
<Spademagnes[R]> Its fucking hard
<Eli> i don't think we need more than 13 episodes... if they hurry up with S4 to make up for it :)
<MadSurge> TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER
<Vivix> S4 will probably also be september 1013
<Flyboy> memes? elements of harmony? thats MLP alright
<Vivix> 2013*
<MrMalk> Eli they will make more for season 3
<Wirisme> there'll inevitably be a movie at some point too
<ekips> Chocolate raaaaiiin
<cachi01|phone> CHOCOLATE RAIN
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<VenHur> Lol
<CreeperPillow> CHOCOLATE RAAAAAIN~
<Spademagnes[R]> Well I would love to stick around but I have to go to another class for school
<Vivix> I seriously doubt we get more than 13 when they said we wont get more than 13 because of "reasons"
<Applejack2012> caos and chocolate
<cachi01|phone> DUN DUN
<Barbetos|AtWork> The elements of Harmony! Honesty! Kindness! Generosity! Rainbow Dash! Luaghter! Magic!
<cachi01|phone> DUN DUN
<Flyboy> dundUN
<QuinnThePegaSistta> yes!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<LadyCanary> YES
<Kinixys> Maybe they are putting the same budget into 13 episodes?
<Wirisme> suddenly fast chat!
<MrMalk> Vivix can we stop speculating and just say we know 13 confirmed so far
<LadyCanary> <3 West Side Story
<Eli> Wirisme: i think so too. sometime during the time between start of S3 and end of S4 they will anounce a movie :)
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 we get 13 eps of season 4 right away
<cachi01|phone> SLAP
<Vivix> I don't think it's speculating when the crew said 13 specifically, look up wil andersons post about it
<CreeperPillow> SLAP
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat RICKmare Moon
<Flyboy> :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> keyboard scootaloo

<Barbetos|AtWork> Nice
<CreeperPillow> Sketch_Toku_Brony: lolol
<alexxm> heh
<MadSurge> Keyboard Cat!
<CreeperPillow> Keyboard Scootaloo
<Sundaysmile> we probably will Sumica, it's a cashcow they can't ignore
<MrMalk> Vivix confirmed they said they could make more than that
<Eli> maybe it's 13 episodes, because the 14th is a movie?
<Sumica> 00,10it's just a matter of they probably only contracted up to 65 eps
<Applejack2012> And then we get impatient for S4 thereafter
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<CreeperPillow> OH god need to download this song
<Sumica> 00,10after that they have to make a new contract

<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica: and that makes me sad. they going to get some crappy animation studio to take over to make more monies.

<CreeperPillow> South Park ohgod
<Wirisme> Gotta watch that episode again now
<Sumica> 00,10it's not a crapy studio
<MadSurge> Sumica: also they're renewing the Hub
<Sundaysmile> I dont think anyone would have Wrek at the first season
<MrMalk> Cant touch this
<Sundaysmile> but there you have it
<Vivix> Barbetos|AtWork, if they do that htey loose money, so they prolly wont
<Bronysith> FOAMY <3
<Applejack2012> Moomins had episodes since the 1970s
<Sumica> 00,10studio B bought them out and have become the largist cildrens production studio
<CreeperPillow> Wut
<Eli> Barbetos|AtWork: they should know that they will lose the fandom as soon as itgets crappy... i hope so at least
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica: yeah the CURRENT one is fine. But if they renew it they are going to get a crappy company to take over I bet.
<MadSurge> Sumica: EXCELLENT

<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica: Oh you must be new to Corperate america
<Flyboy> NO! PLEASE GOD NO! NOOOOOOO!
<Eli> i think i'm gonna watch the "twilight freaks out over nothing" episodes later :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hasbro is the WORST
<Sundaysmile> The change over will probably cause some controversy but if the content speaks for itself then future productions will continue
<Barbetos|AtWork> Unless the CEO is a brony
<LadyCanary> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm bananas
<Barbetos|AtWork> One could only hope.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Sumica well I didn't mean it litterally. Sarcasm is hard to do over the internet and I tend to forget. =\
<Kandarihu> If they premier S3 on October 6th and don't skip weeks, EXACTLY 13 episodes will air from then until the end of 2012. Problem is, they WILL have to skip weeks for holidays.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah we need an icon for sarcasim

<Applejack2012> hello
<TheMaster> these videos are a good way to see if you have a decent grasp of popular culture.
<ekips> I love this tune <3
<Kandarihu> Cartoons go by their own logic. I wouldn't want to watch a cartoon that has absolutely no logic at all.
<Sumica> 00,10must be why I like them

<Barbetos|AtWork> So much for wrek wrist rest XD
<Moopy> hey wrek i like how you make good art work stuff dude your an artest
<MLP_Brovakiin> SafariMonkey: You could pop out the stream and adjust it yourself
<Sundaysmile> And then papyrus
<Kandarihu> Well, the trust is kinda broken after all of what he streamed in the morning.
<Barbetos|AtWork> MadSurge: Try streaming some time, once you get a good following its gets really addicting.
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: I can imagine
<Sumica> 00,10wrek should draw a pegasisisisisisisisisis
<Gold_Demona> Outside of Bronystate, I don't know enough people who'd even want to watch me. :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would not personally know, but I helped some one get into it, and that is what he told me of the experience.
<LadyCanary> Fuckyeahvikingmetal?
<Yahooz> as always
<Moopy> know your talking
<Sundaysmile> Wrek draw a Cloud, but make it hawt
<SafariMonkey> Moopy: I mean in fullscreen. popout then zoom in doesn't zoom player
<Yahooz> SafariMonkey: unfortunantly, no way of doing that
<Kandarihu> And given my own silence during that, I bear just as much responsibility for that as Wrek.
<Moopy> wait so i have to pop the screen out?
<cachi01|phone> While we were watching super pony time 3 my mom came to the room..... She starts saying it looked so gay and not manly........... Then a song she likes starts playing and i muted the stream and she said hey i liked that song! And i said u said it was gay so deal with it. And she got mad........
<SafariMonkey> Yahooz: I know in jwplayer you can, but not here, huh?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> lol!@
<Wrek> 05hardest part is finding a good pose
<Moopy> stop using the word gay in here dude
*Eli aplauds cachi01|phone
<Pearly> ok, the special somepony, big mac says alot and the ponyville confidential says alot
<Kandarihu> There's nothing gay about MLP
<Eli> Moopy: why?
<Yahooz> nope, not that i know of
<Pearly> who does his voice is just epic
<cachi01|phone> Kandarihu tell that to her
<Moopy> cause we don't want that in here
<QuinnThePegaSistta> the real meaning og gay is being happy
<cachi01|phone> Moopy dude some people here are gay
<cachi01|phone> Not me
<Eli> Moopy: it's just offensive if you make it so...
<Kandarihu> Try showing her an episode. Try showing her the beginning.
<Moopy> can you please stop using that please
<Yahooz> dat GigabitHarmonie
<cachi01|phone> QuinnThePegaSistaa no one uses that meaning anymore
<Eli> lot's of people have called me gay, and even though i'm not i don't give a fuck. it's not an insult, is it?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> no one is using it negatively
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Sumica> 00,10quick every one voge
<Sumica> 00,10strike a pose
<cachi01|phone> Eli ikr same here. But my own mom? She cant stand the idea of men watching ponies
<Bronysith> wait wheres GigabitHarmonie ?
<cachi01|phone> Eli if u are not gay i think its an insult....
<Eli> it's a sexsual preference. nothing wrong about that. and cachi01|phone my own mom is one of the people who called me gay. including 2 of my brothers
<QuinnThePegaSistta> they just dont understand
<Moopy> SIGH
*Sundaysmile poses like a bronze adonis

<Sundaysmile> Cachi01 - Friends come and go, but family's for life. Don't overlook that
<Bronysith> wait are we talking about sexuality in here?
<Eli> QuinnThePegaSistta: i don't actually care. there will be a time i actually introduce them to a girlfriend, and laugh at their faces, but till then, who cares?
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith nope
<QuinnThePegaSistta> right, I like your mind set Eli

<QuinnThePegaSistta> hello
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Nerom :)
<Eli> cachi01|phone: she dies. don't worry ;P
<cachi01|phone> Sundaysmile we've been through so much shit i dont think we will stop being friends.lol
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek wich pony are you going to draw this time?
<Vivix> Is this Wrek's first male drawing?
<MaxTheBrony> i dont know
<MaxTheBrony> i dont think so
<Ember> hello, this my first time tuning in on this livestream. Looking awsome so far :o
<Vivix> face looks kinda manly to me-
<Nerom> Ohh Wrek drawing. love those, just saw his latest just saying desktop!
<cachi01|phone> Eli i know. You dont know how much i enjoyed kicking her ass
<Wrek> 05fucking colts
<Sundaysmile> I never said you'd stop being friends bro, but once you and your friends have bigger priorities in life, it'll change. So don't ignore your bro
<Vivix> o wrek
<Wrek> 05drawing their faces in profiel sucks
<SafariMonkey> What tablet are you using?
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix yeah its a male but i dont think its the first.
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Vivix> Ahh, I've never seen him draw a male
<Eli> cachi01|phone: i enjoed killing them all (muahahah) except axel. that was sad :(
<MaxTheBrony> me neither
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<QuinnThePegaSistta> lol Wrek
<cachi01|phone> Sundaysmile my bro can go and screw himself
<SafariMonkey> Wrek: What tablet are you using?
<cachi01|phone> Eli i thought axel sacrificed himself
<Vivix> Intuos 4 i think
<MaxTheBrony> Im sure he is using a wacom
<Sundaysmile> He has time to grow up
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<cachi01|phone> Eli and killing xion in days was even sadder :(
<MaxTheBrony> Oh i love using old papper as a background , makes it so much easier to draw :3
<Nerom> He is using a wacom intouse4 if he has not upgraded
<Ember> i played that part, was sad indeed.
<MaxTheBrony> then you dont get the block as easily
<Vivix> I want Intuos for their rubbery tips- I like that resistance I get from paper
<Eli> cachi01|phone: he did. yeah xion was sad to. reminds me, a friend stole that game from me!
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix i would love to have that one aswell :)
<cachi01|phone> Eli lol go get it back
<Vivix> it sounds awesome
<SafariMonkey> I'm amateur, I have a bamboo. :P
<Vordox> Wrek, Try pointer curves for COlts, while keeping the sleeker lines for Mares? :P
<Vivix> colts can be smooth ;__;
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> the face is the big difference
<Ember> i would love to even have a skill for drawing D:
<Wirisme> me too but i suck too much to want to practice at all
<Vivix> I'm currently reading about horse anatomy to learn how to draw hooves and legs
<cachi01|phone> My drawings are poorly drawn stick figures lol
<Kandarihu> Sumica, you said to strike a pose, right? http://derpy.me/MhZ34
<Ember> i tried realy hard but i just dont have the "wrist for it"other people tell me :S
<Vivix> I can't draw straight lines, but I can still draw
<Vivix> so- its practice, no matter what you start out with
<Kinixys> Create to your strengths.
<Eli> Wirisme: that's a bad thing. i have zero talent either, but i worked up some skill by just doing it over and over. believe me it gets fun :)
<cachi01|phone> I would like to be good at drawing but just for fun not for work or anything
<Wirisme> I hope so :)
<QuinnThePegaSistta> Im going to go make myself some soup cuz im hungry brb
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #554
<Vivix> same here, I just do it for fun
<Vivix> I couldn't get a job in it anwyay, too much pressure for something I only occationally enjoy
<Sundaysmile> wanna be good at something gotta put the time in :P
<Dovah> so whats wrek drawing?
<Vivix> yep
<AlphaThroughZet> i just realized those other alphas are me
<Vivix> no matter what, you can probably learn it
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<Vivix> but learning takes more than a month
<MaxTheBrony> exactly
<AlphaThroughZet> could some one kick them
<Eli> if you wanna try drawing ponies, i recomend Derpy to start. she's quite easy :) i've started to doodle her on blank pages all the time
<Sumica> 00,10wait...... is that a colt
<Sundaysmile> hell you can learn to fly a plane if you want to it just takes time
<Vivix> I think so Sumica
<MaxTheBrony> Well theres more to drawing than ponies :3
<Sumica> 00,10*shock*
<Vivix> Maybe your Oc can be a boy again!
<LadyCanary> :O
<LadyCanary> Oh my gurd
<Vordox> Sumica: I K R!
<MaxTheBrony> dun dun duuun
<Kinixys> It's 90% perspiration.
<Barbetos|AtWork> How to MvM: http://derpy.me/5r5vS
<AlphaThroughZet> CAN SOME ONE KICK THE OTHER MES!!!!
<SafariMonkey> It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something
<Vivix> I really like drawing real horses, but it's a bit hard still
<Ember> well, untill after a few years of practice with no progression you will start to wonder if you do have skill for it xD
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix i need your help xD
<Applejack2012> I used to draw as a kid but haven't done that since
<Vivix> yeah when you kinda reach the hurdle, you stop seeing your own improvement andh ave to look back and compare to remind yourself
<MaxTheBrony> you have trained drawing horses yes?
<Wirisme> I guess whether or not I'm good at something affects my enjoyment of doing it
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony, ooh? Well, not trained, but I'm trying to learn it properly, atm I can do faces and necks pretty well-
<Sundaysmile> or look to new sources vivix, kinda like broadening your horizons
<Applejack2012> Havent drawn since since the 1980s
<cachi01|phone> Barbetos LOL
<Vivix> Sundaysmile, yeah
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5dcsus help me with the anatomy xD what can i keep and what should i change here.
*Vivix looks
<SafariMonkey> Ember: I did that with 3d art. I discovered that while I was expert at technical realisation, I just didn't have the creativity. This after 4-5 years.
<AlphaThroughZeta> THANKS :)
<LadyCanary> ...Oh my god.
<LadyCanary> These vocals <3
<LadyCanary> Beautiful.
<CreeperPillow> Hey guys, I'm back. Oooh, first Wrek stream in DAYS
<Eli> i believe everyone can get skill. how fast you get it, that's talent.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya CreeperPillow :)
<Wirisme> That's pretty much where I stand too Eli
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek streamed yesterday?
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Nerom> I don't know why but I love wreks taste in music
<CreeperPillow> Hiya MaxTheBrony
<Barbetos|AtWork> CreeperPillow: he streamed all morning yesterday. It was a rock marathon
<MLP_Brovakiin> welcome back CreeperPillow
<AlphaThroughZeta> anyone else here in michigan
<MaxTheBrony> exactly :D
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony, it looks pretty good, but I'd look at the hindlegs and haunches abit more, and maybe strengthening the appearance of the joints on the forelegs
<Sundaysmile> nope just Scotland here
<Applejack2012> wb
<Ember> well, then i will keep trying then i guess.
<Vivix> let me fetch something-
<Applejack2012> There was still streaming as I went to bed at night
<LadyCanary> :) so lovely
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if it is going to be firewall.
<Kencolt> Barbetos|AtWork: UNtil it turned into a crossdressing British Comedian Marathon.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or shining armor
<MaxTheBrony> Vivix more details ? And more correct anatomy i presume :P ?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Kencolt you know you enjoyed it
<cachi01|phone> Brb going for icecream. I would give u guys some but i dont have one of those fancy teleporters kids have now this days.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or an OC?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Guessing games are fun
<Kencolt> Barbetos|AtWork: I was at times amused. But Twilight never figured it out-- Look! SHe still IS!
<AlphaThroughZeta> becuase i need help getting work papers
<Sundaysmile> MaxtheBrony - my advice is to experiment with stuff you're uncomfortable or personally feel unskilled with drawing. Develop that then apply it to stuff you like drawing
<Vivix> MaxTheBrony, yeah, the upper body and such is good, and the back of the horse part is good- but the haunch and rump area looks a bit- unattural with the cutout, and the foreleg looks like it misses a joint- http://www.drgarfinkel.com/images/site/images/horse_502.gif look at this for instance- and try stylizing a bit like you did with the rest
<Jmo> o.o
<MaxTheBrony> Ah thanks :D
<MaxTheBrony> really appriciate this Vivix :)
<Kandarihu> BTW, the pic I linked to is my PSO2 character. Cute, ain't she?
<Vivix> often on strong horses the joints on the forelegs look pretty good if they're a bit eh--visible and strong looking, and no problem ^^
<cachi01|phone> A gif that doesnt move? WHATS THIS SORCERY
<Vivix> hehe
<Ember> dont know if i can, but can i post a link for a drawing a friend made in 5 minutes with no kind of expierience of that kind of style in the chat?
<AlphaThroughZeta> anyone here in michigan
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, a single frame.
<AlphaThroughZeta> SRSLY
<Ember> im jealous of her, shes so good at drawing.
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone may post photo links i think , aslong as its art.
<Sundaysmile> Kandarihu you could always add an extra frame and make it PARTY HARD
<LadyCanary> And now back to the metals.
<Bronysith> http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/04/dark-souls-director-thinking-about-adding-easy-mode NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MaxTheBrony> Ikr Bronysith xD
<Dovah> easy mode? fuck that shit!
*Vivix almsot always plays casual mode in games
<MaxTheBrony> I think they should fix PC version first
<Vivix> ^
<AlphaThroughZeta> HEY ANYONE IN MICHIGAN USA
<Sundaysmile> agreed should be super hard mode on the Kinect
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<AlphaThroughZeta> SRSLY
<MaxTheBrony> AlphaThroughZeta no i dont think so
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Kandarihu> Sundaysmile, I was responding to cachi01|phone's question about what sorcery is a non-animated gif.
<Dovah> Vivix: dark souls has no casual! it just gets harder!
<Vivix> ;__; but I like easy things
<MaxTheBrony> And thus that game became more badass.
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> well, actually, I like heavy story and little action
<Sundaysmile> I know
<Pearly> Pearly as returned
<Dovah> Then you Suck.
<Vivix> I doo
<Vivix> but I like having fun too
<Ember> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&global=1&q=meganick44#/d55bqh5 like i said, in 5 minutes with no expierence in that style, she did that.
<MaxTheBrony> Welcome back Pearly :)
<Bronysith> DARK SOULS
<Bronysith> ISNT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY
<Pearly> thank you
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<AlphaThroughZeta> i guess im the ONLY MICHIGAN BRONY
<Kandarihu> Anyway, about that pic. That giant fish behind my back... it's a lethal joke weapon. An Event Sword called the Space Tuna.
<Vivix> That's pretty neat for such little experience ember
<Pearly> MaxTheBrony, how are you darlin?
<MaxTheBrony> Lol this rage of different play styles its horrifying.
<MaxTheBrony> Pearly i am good , how are you :)?
<Vivix> I'e never enjoyed hard for the sake of hard, I like hard games, but I often think running around for hours shooting super high level enemies with no health is boring
<Vivix> and as such almost always play easy or casual on modern fps games
<Sundaysmile> Dark Souls is meant to put you into a corner until you scratch your eyes out and wonder why someone would do this to you
<Ember> umm no, that is I wanna be the guy gaiden
<Bronysith> Dark souls is meant to make you feel like you got raped
<Bronysith> Well
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Bronysith> she is a dominatrix
<Sundaysmile> Bronysith gets it
<Bronysith> very cruel
<Bronysith> but then she rewards you afterwords
<Vivix> I've never played Dark Souls, as the ad looked boring, but hating on easy mode is really stupid, you're not forced to play it on easy
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmmmm the only colt unicorn I know of is Derpy_Hooves OC
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Sundaysmile> Take Ninja Gaiden for example...
<Kandarihu> I understand there's no pausing in Dark Souls. If you get a phone call, you have to find a safe-spot of some kind.
<MaxTheBrony> Woah
<Pearly> MaxTheBrony, I am good, for the most part. I suppose!
<Ember> but dark souls is a realistic game if you ask me, because if i was that guy i wouldnt survive a dragon spitting fire right in my face.
<Vivix> that sounds kinda fun, kinda, no save is stupid since I have things to do other than play games
<MaxTheBrony> Pearly good to hear!
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> but it has that, right?
<MaxTheBrony> yes it does , it must have
<Caramel> Sumica: You mean only OCs, or like...any. Cause I'm fairly sure Shining is a unicorn :P
<MaxTheBrony> but no checkpoints
<AlphaThroughZet> kick the other me Pls
*Vivix rubs hands
<MaxTheBrony> i think
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Sundaysmile> Vivix look up Dark Souls RAGE on youtube, you'll have videos of hilarity
<Vivix> hehehe
<Dovah> Vivix: extream auto save no manual so if you screw up sux2bu
<Sumica> 00,10yeah OC's
<Caramel> ah
<AlphaThroughZet> the server keeps reseting on me
<Sumica> 00,10suppose wrek might do a shining and Twilie pick
<Pearly> I now feel so unmotive for some reason
<Vivix> but why should I not be allowed to play it with easy mode then? I'm not a good gamer, and I suck at fps
<MaxTheBrony> Should i keep Centaur idea or go with this ? http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5dg1n8
<Sundaysmile> Vivix, you could always just get better at it :P
<Dovah> Vivix: I suppose you could stay on playthrough 1... its easyish..
<Vivix> hm-
<AlphaThroughZet> KICK THE OTHER MEEEEE!!!! PLS
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Vivix> but yea no I'm not getting better at FPS, I've been playing for..10 ish years
<AlphaThroughZet> THANKS!!
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6550193920 HA
<Dovah> Dark Souls isnt fps
<Vivix> or well--yeah I started playing doom and such in the mid early 90s
<Vivix> but I'm not getting good at FPS, I don't want to practice
<Ember> did you improve on the way to now vivix?
<MaxTheBrony> Well Darksouls is a 3rd person rpg?
<Bronysith> The reason why most NES games were hard were to elongate a game, MAKE IT SO FUCKING HARD
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/eLNfQ.jpg
<Vivix> Probably, can't remember
<Dovah> Vivix: then dont play?
<Ember> if not, maybe its not the kind of game for you.
<EnderPillow> Shizuka: Dinkleberrrrg....
<Vivix> I won't buy dark souls because it didn't look fun for mee, but I'm just commenting on hating on easy mode, I don't get it

<Ember> stand a chance*
<Kammerjunk> And then I realise I'm probably the only guy who reads those books.
<mentallyeffedguy> Ember: whats OC?
<Vivix> My 'oc' is a deer, it would just fly away with rudolph powers
<Jmo> It'd look lovely on my wall.
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: possibly
<QuinnThePegaSistta> an OC is an Own Character
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: i have never heard of em

<Kammerjunk> cachi01|phone: MMM that you only meant well?
<Vivix> I think its just some unnamed stallion-
<Sundaysmile> Applejack as a Valkyrie????? OH YES
<Dark_Horst> does seem pretty viking though
<Vivix> Kammerjunk, best use of vocoder in recent history
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk because u didnt
<Ember> mine would be on the other side of the coutrey in ten seconds flat
<QuinnThePegaSistta> I have two Oc's one is an earth pony and the other is a unicorn, im workign on a pegesis now
<Dark_Horst> note the helmet
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: I concur.
<Vivix> looks like stormcloak armor
<Kammerjunk> Stohmklohk.
<Ember> I used to be an adventurer like you, but then i became a pony.
<Vivix> Stormkappe
<Kammerjunk> Oh.

<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<SirGanjalf> dat Bamboleo cover
<mentallyeffedguy> i thought it was applejack because of its tail :P
*Barbetos|AtWork makes a creepy sweaty face "Bueno."
<Kammerjunk> Hello, Lil_B.
<Applejack2012> hey
<cachi01|phone> Hi Lil_B :)
<MadSurge> Hello Lil_B!
<Vivix> I've met more danes than swedes and norwegians here, I think
<QuinnThePegaSistta> hey
<Ember> im kinda unlucky, im the only brony in the netherlands as far as i know it D:
<Masdragonflare> Hey guys!
<Applejack2012> I work together with a Brony
<Kammerjunk> Masdragonflare: Salve!
<Applejack2012> hey
<SirGanjalf> I want to hear "Macarena" covered by the same band now.
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk it would have been funny to name the mall city 17
<Masdragonflare> Oh looks like a joined just in time :D
<Vivix> I think other than Jim, mentallyeffedguy is first Norwegian I've seen in a while
<Wirisme> Applejack2012: that's awesome
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk oh yeah city i know that type of mall. Shouldn't surprise me theres alot of bronies in this city too but as far as having heard about any or seeing any in general is a nope so far
<Kammerjunk> cachi01|phone: That would be brilliant.
<Lil_B> thanks Kammerjunk AppleDash cachi01|phone and MadSurge ;)
<Masdragonflare> Who's the drawning from :D?
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk and then get sue by Valve
<Masdragonflare> oh wait
<BronyInstrumental> http://derpy.me/ofsLz
<Dark_Horst> bearded pony?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: I just walk around in pony clothing articles. Much easier.
<Dark_Horst> now it's a true viking
<Sundaysmile> who's doing the bamboleiro cover?
<VikingCanary> Ole!
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk wait as in a store there that had the MLP FIM clothes?
<Masdragonflare> Guys?
<Masdragonflare> I mean Ponies?
<Vivix> wuat?
<Ember> since im here btw, any dutch bronies in the chat?
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Oh no, I was walking around the store dressed in pony swag.
<Masdragonflare> Who's the drawning from?
<cachi01|phone> killerpony7733 hot topic
<Sundaysmile> Wrek who sang the bamboleiro cover?
<Vivix> I think one of hte mods were Dutch? one of the old ones? Am I totally memoryfail now?
<Kammerjunk> Masdragonflare: Wrek's drawing.
<Masdragonflare> Yeah Kammerjunk
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk u know that swag means secretly we are gay right? xD
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk aaah makes sense. But as far as having seen any here is a big no on my end. I don't have pony swag either
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Not impossible.
<Masdragonflare> I guess I'll see :)
<Vivix> Lulu or Luna?..I might be wrong
<Kammerjunk> No, Luna's from Deutschland.
<Masdragonflare> I'm sure it will be awesome ;)
<Kammerjunk> IIRC.
<Dark_Horst> cachi01|phone: wat?
<Vivix> hmm..yes
<mentallyeffedguy> i knew that wrek werent drawing with his hand, cuz that would have been impossibru!
<VikingCanary> Vivix: ViVi is from Germany I believe.
<cachi01|phone> Dark_Horst swag was created by a gay group
<Vivix> oh yeah I remember that
<killerpony7733> VikingCanary in total we have around 5 at max i think of EU mods
<Vivix> but I could have sworn that one of the mods were Dutch-
<cachi01|phone> Dark_Horst it means secretly we are gay
<Dark_Horst> neverheard of that one
<Vivix> s w a g
<Lil_B> VikingCanary yes she is :)
<BronyInstrumental> technically swag is just a lazy way to announce one's swagger
<mentallyeffedguy> have anyone else watched the mov series on youtube? Rainbowdash always says swag :P
<Lil_B> is my connection dead again?
<Kammerjunk> None of the current mods are Dutch, it seems.
<Vivix> Swag is a very old word though
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Yes.
<Masdragonflare> I've been drawing some ponies on school
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk thats bad :/
<Masdragonflare> since I was bored and all
<cachi01|phone> I hate the word swag...
<Wrek> 05so far so good
<cachi01|phone> Its just so stupid
<cachi01|phone> Like YOLO
<Masdragonflare> Wrek?
<Kammerjunk> Lil_B: Your connection is the deadest dead in the history of cemeteries.
<Vivix> I'm neutral on the word swag, since its..almost never audible to me
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Masdragonflare> Who's the lucky pony Wrek?
<Masdragonflare> :p
<cachi01|phone> Vivix lucky you
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: lets hope you dont fuck it up :)
<Vivix> swag originates from the 1700s I think and means treasure or..flowers
<Sundaysmile> found the bamboleo cover!
<Kammerjunk> swag (verb): To sway or cause to sway.
<Lil_B> Kammerjunk is is unbearable for me to not chat with Bronystate right now... because my connection is so very dead
<SirGanjalf> also S.W.A.G. - Secretly We Are Gay, from what i've heard
<Applejack2012> I used to draw ponies for decades ago
<cachi01|phone> That would be swagging
<BronyInstrumental> allow me to swag you, Kammerjunk
<cachi01|phone> SirGangalf yeah
<VikingCanary> Oh Wreky it looks wonderful ^_^
<Vivix> 1500s* to sway, a bulging bag, products given away for free, (modern, cheap drugs) and festoon
<Applejack2012> thumbs up Wrek
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Da.
<SirGanjalf> It probably has more than one meaning.
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: Yeah. It also means to decorate something with loops of draped fabric.
<Vivix> yeah, the original meaning is a big bag, or to cause to sway
<Kammerjunk> It probably stems from Old Norse "sveggja".
<Vivix> yyes probably-
<Ember> if that picture is done i will try to get it for my background xD
<Ember> its awsome so far
<Vivix> svai, skikkelig herpa svai
<Kammerjunk> It is.
<Vivix> brb darlings
<Kammerjunk> Right-o.
<Lil_B> the biggest setback for an artist is when the tools he uses are so bad that he becomes unwilling to do his art because it would mean to deal with them :(
<cachi01|phone> Ember wreky.deviantart.com
<Ember> oky-doky-loky

<Applejack2012> bye
<cachi01|phone> Ember hey guys im a brony
<Ember> im trying to tell them that for a while now, but i cant get the courage to tell them :|
<AndroUser2> This makes total sense to me
<cachi01|phone> Thats how i told my friends
<SirGanjalf> Ember: -Hey what are you watching? -Ponies. -Oh, ok.
<Wirisme> exactly, it's not a big deal
<Lil_B> Ember find a way to talk about the issue like "I heard MLP was getting a big follwing, what do yyou think about it "to find out what they think before telling them (or to find out if you even want to tell them)
<cachi01|phone> My tv has a record option and my mom watched My little pony was being recorded.....
<cachi01|phone> Thats how she and my family found ouy
<cachi01|phone> T
<Ember> their buisness is that i dont have to hide what i love to share the most.
<Spademagnes[R]> Well my plan to use this school computer for non school stuff is shot to hell
<AndroUser2> Hi
<cachi01|phone> Geez i have more trust in my friends than my family lol
<AndroUser2> 0,10,1
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, that itself is a problem.

<Kammerjunk> ^
<Masdragonflare> what was her reaction
<Masdragonflare> ?
<MaxTheBrony> :D
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, frankly, the proper thing to do is to convince your family that Frienship is Magic is an alright series.
<Wrek> 05Sundaysmile: just sub to my spotify megametalist
<Wrek> 05everythign is in it
<MaxTheBrony> Wrek want me to link it?

<MaxTheBrony> Wrek playlist -> http://open.spotify.com/user/joish/playlist/0FDICVUwvEjQaauzVjRzf0
<Spademagnes[R]> How is it gay?

<Kammerjunk> cachi01|phone: Show her the IRC, lol.
<Applejack2012> Yeah my sister told I might get FiM as a Birthday present
<Sundaysmile> Much obliged, downloading now
<MaxTheBrony> thats awesome?
<cachi01|phone> Kandarihu the only thing she says is Because they are fucking.ponies
<Masdragonflare> what's FiM?
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk already did that
<SirGanjalf> Well, if she thinks about the original meaning of word "gay"...
<Spademagnes[R]> What a dumbass...
<Kammerjunk> cachi01|phone: Oh.
<Kandarihu> Masdragonflare, Friendship is Magic
<Sundaysmile> it's magic masdragonflare

<Masdragonflare> gl with that :p
<Spademagnes[R]> I actually managed to get a streamer who really didnt like bronies to accept me being one
<cachi01|phone> Kammerjunk i told her andrew W.K was a brony........she told my dad that andrew W.K composed the music for MLP
<Ember> but i gotta go now people, maybe see you guys later

<Spademagnes[R]> Man the super boss from Xenosaga Ep 3 was a pain
<Kandarihu> cachi01|phone, perhaps some contrast is needed then. It may be neccessary for your mom to see G3, just to understand how bad FiM is NOT
<AJIsAwesome> What's Wrek drawing today?
<Spademagnes[R]> He can easily combo you to death
<MaxTheBrony> viking pony

<SirGanjalf> Llevan Polka, right?
<Applejack2012> is it some kind of a cruel joke?
<cachi01|phone> Brb getting a leek
<SirGanjalf> or Loituma song?
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, I regretted buying an EA game seconds after committing to it on Steam.
<Sumica> 00,10it will look just like clestia only furbyshaped
<cachi01|phone> Llevn polka sirgangañg
<Sumica> 00,10and it will pur when you pat it's mane

<AJIsAwesome> I have another story for you all. I went to go get lunch this afternoon, and when I asked for a couple slices of pizza, the guy said "Sure, anything for a fellow brony!" I was honestly surprised that he knew I was, and that made my day so much. :)
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: we saw two axes

<Sumica> 00,10axes are also good
<Sumica> 00,10getting dizzy

<Vivix> en blodskontraahht
<cachi01|phone> Hey guys apparently to enjoy the ps4 at full quality u will need a 4k tv........
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: why does that pony have such big ears?
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> px is px
<Wrek> 05cachi01|phone: and peopel say consoles are the cheap gaming
<cachi01|phone> Wrek IKR
<SafariMonkey> cachi01|phone: fk dollars?
<Vivix> I don't think you need anything over 19201080 to enjoy ps4
<SafariMonkey> *4k
<cachi01|phone> SafariMonkey a 4K SCREEN
<SafariMonkey> cachi01|phone: as in res or price>?
<cachi01|phone> SafariMonkey 4K = a theatre screen
<SafariMonkey> and it'll still be awesome at lower
<Vivix> 4 000 usd?
<Lil_B> and people still say Nintendo is too Gimmicky... at least they give the opportunity to do something different with games, while the Playstation only gets higher resolution and better operating power each cycle :/
<Sumica> 00,10gonna do any thing with back legs wrek?
<Vivix> PS3 is getting weak compared to computers though, so they have to
<Vivix> Wii was fun, but I don't really like jumping around while playing games-
<Wrek> 05Sumica: aye
<Wrek> 05cuffed boots
<Wrek> 05of some sort
<Lil_B> Vivix well, the WiiU won't be about jumping around that much (at least it seems so
<SafariMonkey> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution ?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah was gonna say he needs some boots
<Vivix> uncut horseshoenails
<Vivix> WiiU I haven't read about, but it'll probably be good
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: how long have you been drawing on this on?
<VikingCanary> Me gusta :3
<Wrek> 05this one..
<Sumica> 00,10hour 30
<Wrek> 051 hour 47 minutes
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: What? Apparently WiiU is terrible...
<Sumica> 00,10eh I was close
<Vivix> Wrek, steel horseshoes with uncut nails as a bludegeon tool
<Vivix> SafariMonkey, haven't read, no opinion
<SafariMonkey> Vivix, cool
<Pearly> its the first that nintendo made that is 1080p
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: youre a dedicated drawer then
<Vivix> I'm just going for the whole- most consoles were good, and most next gens will probably be aswell, just different
<cachi01|phone> WiiU is going to be awesome
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: It is?
<Pearly> AC III is on it that is well something cool
<cachi01|phone> Zombie u looks awesome
<cachi01|phone> And nintendo land will be fun to play with friends.and family
<Lil_B> nowerdays, picking a Console is like trying to vote... everything has a lot of downsides, I just can choose the one that has the least bad ones... and thats Nintendo for me :)
<Wrek> 05i bet once the new ones are released
<cachi01|phone> And dont.forget the multive--, i mean miiverse
<Wrek> 05they will be so expensive on the market
<Wrek> 05that you'd be better of buying parts to a PC
<Vivix> Lil_B, yeah you just have to choose what suits you best
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: Yeah, well we won't know until it's released. And of course some people aren't social so don't like social gaming devices...
<Vivix> Wrek that was teh case last release, I remember
<Vordox> Wrek! You improved alot! On the armor and anatomy looks Youner Colt like!
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Oh. I see. Okay.
<Wrek> 05and then you can replace parts as they become obsolete
<Wrek> 05not the case with your console
<Pearly> that tank game looked fun
<Wrek> 05jsut saiyan
<Lil_B> btw, the MiiVerse IS NOT some Facebook like application that links every game and everything you do too your friends -.-
<Vivix> yeah, I have i7 2600 3.4ghz cpu and 16gb ram, etc- but I haven't blown a single paycheck
<Vivix> just took it slowly
<cachi01|phone> PC is best gaming device IMO. Too bad i cant afford one :(
<Vivix> I need a new gcard and am looking at 600 series-
<mentallyeffedguy> ive been doing homework for 6 hours now, and im fukin tired

<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Faroese here
<VikingCanary> Ooh~
<Vivix> I bought PC, and feel I got more value for money, but console is--different, it's fun too
<Vivix> Ooh, never met anyone from there SafariMonkey
<mentallyeffedguy> Vivix: vel dra meg baklengs ut av fuglekassa! :P
<Vivix> hehe
<Vordox> PHANTASY STAR ONLINE 2!

<Vordox> Lil_B: Check youtube trailer =3
<cachi01|phone> PC has amnesia, mods for almost every game, better graphics, slender, And TF2.......
<Vivix> well its not just that
<Vivix> PC is upgradeable for little money
<cachi01|phone> But wii U has zombie U cabt decide xd
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: The spoken language is similar to the old norse. :P
<Vivix> buy a really good pc and you can maintain it as really good for little money for many years
<Lil_B> Vordox no, I waste enough of my time as it is XD, btw can I show you my latest progress? (I have a couple of questions)
<Vivix> Ah yeah, is it similar to Icelandic?
<Vordox> Lil_B: Go ahead. I'll answer to my best effort =3
<Illusive_Elusive> <3
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Written, yes, but spoken it is closer to modern norwegian
<mentallyeffedguy> Wrek: will you be posting it on equestria daily? i wanna see it when its finished :O
<Masdragonflare> Wrek, I will like this.
<Vivix> SafariMonkey, cool- ah the languages. I always thought Icelandic looked really cool, but haven't seen Faroean (how u sai)
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: I can understand norwegian perfectly, and can read icelandic
<Masdragonflare> No matter how hard you might fail
<Masdragonflare> I will
<Masdragonflare> :)
<Vivix> Niice
<Illusive_Elusive> http://wreky.deviantart.com/ Seems everything ends up here eventually.
<SafariMonkey> Vivix: Faroese
<Vivix> ah yes, thank you
<SirGanjalf> cachi01|phone: I recommend you to wait a bit after WiiU release - see if they'll will be more games you'll be interested. Otherwise - PC.
<SirGanjalf> *there will be
<Vivix> ^
<cachi01|phone> Illusive_Elusive yep thats wrek devaintart page :)
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 drawfriend labels this as skyrim pony
<mentallyeffedguy> SafariMonkey: where are you from?
<Sumica> 00,10or Dovapony
<cachi01|phone> Yeah i will get a PC
<cachi01|phone> And if i can. Also a wii U
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone PC, wait for WiiU Pricedrop then, and you will see how the Console is like by then :)
<Illusive_Elusive> ^
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B it will release in november. And theres always the christmas discounts
<cachi01|phone> So theres a posibilty of buyinh both
<SirGanjalf> Besides: You can always buy a console, finish the exclusives you like, then sell it and invest money in PC:P
<Vivix> Nintendos often launch cheaper than other consoles
<cachi01|phone> If not. I will wait for the price drop :)
<Vivix> so you might be able to get both
<Lil_B> since the NES Nintendo has always released their consoles on the same day before black friday
*lyrical anyone was in YayPonies channel?
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B november 12 or 11 yep
<cachi01|phone> My mom thought Judas Priest was tenacious D dafuq xD
<SafariMonkey> Vivix and mentallyeffedguy: my mum is faroese, my dad is british and i lived the first 13 years of my life in senegal, west africa. I since moved to the UK and have lived here for 4 years. I know english, faroese, saafi saafi (local) and french and can read danish.

<SirGanjalf> I plan to buy some current gen console after new ones are released... And here's the question: Is Xbox version of RDR really that superior in graphics compared to PS3 version?
<cachi01|phone> oh :)
<mentallyeffedguy> anyone else that likes too lisen to queen?
<cachi01|phone> SirGanjalf nope. Its just more shiny
<Wirisme> I like them but I don't listen to them regularly
<cachi01|phone> ^
<SafariMonkey> I honestly couldn't make up a more international upbringing. :P
<SirGanjalf> cachi01|phone: PS3 it should be then:)

<cachi01|phone> This is Evanescence right?
<Spademagnes[R]> "fixed"
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: and it still angers the fans because it fixes almost nothing
<shibaru> Hi.
<CK|GW2> Erm, that doesn't sound like Amy Lee.
<Spademagnes[R]> To this day I still find Xenosaga Episode Three's super boss to be bullshit
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: Awesome. :D I'm so jealous of your bread. Did you just make it with food colouring or with flavours?
<cachi01|phone> CK sounds almost the same
<CCCP> *hugs SuperBrony64* hello
<CK|GW2> No, it really doesn't.
<MadSurge> I'm glad that instead Infamous is relatively short but the ending is great :)
<CK|GW2> It sounds a bit more like....oof, I can never spell her last name.
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Really? I sold it as soon as I beat it. So I didn't wait for the DLC.
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge eeyup
<CK|GW2> The lead from Within Temptation.
*SuperBrony64 hugs CCCP back 'Hai :D'
<CCCP> :D
<CountDoofus> Sharon Den Adel?
<CK|GW2> But I'm pretty sure it's not her either.
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: played Infamous too? :$
<CK|GW2> That sounds right.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Klumzeedragon: Food coloring :) But I had to separate each part of it and add food coloring.
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge i almost had platinum trophy :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It took me about an hour to just add the food coloring to all the pieces.
<Kandarihu> Wow. I logged out of PSO2, but I'm still lagged. I think the problem is with Flash.
<MadSurge> cachi01|phone: Infamous 2 is great too :D
<Polydunami> This is a lonely song :(
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: Sounds tedious. Didja take a picture of it before you inhaled it? :P
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge i havent played Infamous 2 :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Klumzeedragon: Of the bread?
<Kjakings> 7Evening.
<CK|GW2> But yeah, not Amy Lee. Tsk tsk, tricking me into thinking I was missing Evanescence while making a test for my students. ._. Good song, but still, bah-ram-yew.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll PM it to you.
<Klumzeedragon> SuperBrony64: Yeah. :D I'd like to see it if you got a picture. :)

<CountDoofus> Guys, little question. If I were to start a NSFW Tumblr (no gore or 34 or anything, just language and maybe some violence), would anyone follow me?
<Wrek> 05so far so good!
<cachi01|phone> My mom wants to take me with a phsycologist :/
<Wrek> 05the armor turned out ebtter than i had hoped

<MLP_Brovakiin> cachi01|phone: Jeez, why can't she just accept you as who you are :/ no offence or anything :(
<Wrek> 05adn the music fits well too ^_^
<Polydunami> You'd need to restrict your audience, CountDoofus; if it's NSFW, it's probably not acceptable for children to read the tumblr.
<SirGanjalf> By Celestia's Beard:O
<cachi01|phone> MLP_Brovakiin she is taking.me there because i dont pay much attention in class lol
<VikingCanary> >w<
<CK|GW2> Good lord.

<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: Damn right :D
<OneTrickPony> hai everyone ^_^
<Pikachu> Well....................time for agimp drawing bronystate! :)
<Polydunami> Maybe a more correct way to say it is, "Everything has a time and PLACE." :$
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey OneTrickPony!
<CountDoofus> Haio OneTrickPony
<NocturnalBlade> hi OneTrickPony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello OneTrickPony
<CCCP> i still dont understand why people consider Pop a genre, because just because somthing is popular doesnt mean its in the same genre
<CountDoofus> Is that THE OneTrickPony?
<CCCP> Hi OneTrickPony
<Cades> by getting the grey man to rape him
<SirGanjalf> hello OneTrickPony
<Polydunami> Hey there, OneTrickPony.
<Eli> CCCP: youp. it isn't
<OneTrickPony> so many dings
<Dovah> and den thar was no stream..
<CCCP> over the summer so many ponies didnt come here as often
<MadSurge> Ohai OneTrickPony!
<CCCP> Eli but Pop is considered a genre
<CountDoofus> Guilty.
<Eli> CCCP: really? that's BS... pop isn't a genre
<Polydunami> Aww, I thought I was going to win Ace Attorney, this time :S
<CCCP> Eli at least according to the internet
<shibaru> XD
<Eli> CCCP: yeah, what does the internet know :P
<Polydunami> Pop = Popular music.
<Eli> ^
<CCCP> Eli many things
<Alchemist> http://musicgenreslist.com/ pop is a genre
<Eli> CCCP: it's still not always correct
<Pikachu> gimp shut off bronystate :(
<SirGanjalf> Define "pop"
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: It's mainly big in America. There's like 5 radio stations in my area alone dedicated to Pop.
<Polydunami> Oops
<MLP_Brovakiin> Polydunami: More like this, Poop=popular music :P
<shibaru> I should really get to doing let's plays too
<Polydunami> Oh hey, it's a Caramel!
<RoboGerbil> suddenly Caramel
<Bronysith> oooh Caramel stream
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon really? ithought there were like 50
<VikingCanary> Suddenly Robots
<MadSurge> Hello Caramel! :D
<Creeper|Minecraft> Suddenly Caramel
<thelonepony> Caramel Stream!!
<MadSurge> YAY, MORE ROBOTS
<OneTrickPony> yay
<Eli> Alchemist: it's not an actual genre as it is a mash up of songs that gained popularity
<CCCP> Caramel been here all the time
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: Fine... I didn't want to state the truth. :'(
<shibaru> I can't decide if I wanna do earthbound or spyro first
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon :C
<Pikachu> alrighty ...........o carmel stream hi caramel!
<NocturnalBlade> oooooo leeeets geeet reeeady fooor ROOOOOBOOOOT RUMMMMBLLLLLE
<RoboGerbil> whats data install?
<Cades> do your favorite game last
<Alchemist> Eli: so it is a collection of songs that fit a parameter. What is a genre again?
<Klumzeedragon> CCCP: But I listen to my iPod or the Jazz station if my iPods being stupid. :P
<CCCP> Game is too none english
<SirGanjalf> Alchemist: That site says that 'Anime' is a music genre...
<CountDoofus> Suddenly sea pony Lyra.
<Alchemist> So?
<CCCP> Klumzeedragon i see :D
<Eli> Alchemist: not quite the same. normal genres differ in instruments and style
<shibaru> So earthbound last, got it
<NocturnalBlade> oh hai Lyra
<Polydunami> Anime is a genre? Lies :|
<Alchemist> Eli: ehh, I cant differentiate between trance and house anyways
<CCCP> what genre has the sounds of exploding trucks?
<SirGanjalf> Alchemist: And comedy too... I think they expand the 'music genre' term waaay to much.
<Cades> i would do lets plays, but you've seen how bad the quality is :P
<Alchemist> Eli: there are just as many genres nowdays as there are songs
<Eli> Alchemist: me neither:P i think trance is softer. entrancing if you want
<CCCP> Also CHristmas music is not a genre, Indie is NOT a genre...
<RoboGerbil> Alchemist: trance is usually softer and ambient, house is harder and you can dance to it
<Pikachu> One sec
<Eli> CCCP: indie IS a genre
<alexxm> oh robot wars
<Alchemist> RoboGerbil: is there some way to determine a bit specifically than how it feels like? something more objective?
<CCCP> Eli i dont think that makes sense though
<Eli> CCCP: why?
<SirGanjalf> Disney genre, really?
<Moopy> Ugh..........not again
<RoboGerbil> Alchemist: erm.. its like hard rock vs soft rock.. some bands do both
<CCCP> because many indie bands can have different styles and use different genres Eli, there is no Indie style
<Everlasting_Joy> All right Carame-l sock it to them!
<Polydunami> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7748/ <3
<CCCP> Polydunami so cute :)
<OneTrickPony> Polydunami: D'awww
<Everlasting_Joy> Polydunami: If only in real life. . .
<CountDoofus> Polydunami: I wish I was that guy :'(
<OneTrickPony> ^
<Alchemist> RoboGerbil: okay, but is there a way I can positively say something is x and not y other than "it feels more like x"? Terms like "its softer" is quite subjective.
<CCCP> pinkie hugs a shota
<Polydunami> I want to be hugged...
<Polydunami> By Celestia :D
<Pikachu> Alright time for a surpriseing brony for a alicorn on my Bronystate project!
<CountDoofus> Come to me, Vinyl!
<Polydunami> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7539/
<Pikachu> So who wants to be a alicorn?
<Eli> Polydunami: it's really cute... but i don't like the idea of HIE
<RoboGerbil> Alchemist: well one thing for sure is trance does not have singing
<OneTrickPony> Pikachu: I do
<alexxm> what does curse of geass do
<Polydunami> Well, it's not a BAD thing... just easily mishandled :S
<CCCP> i wish i was hd a pet derpy and she was chubby
<Alchemist> RoboGerbil: okay, I will have to settle for that :D
<Pikachu> OneTrickPony: alrighty then whats will ur cutie mark be?
<NocturnalBlade> CCCP: why chubby?
<Eli> Polydunami: i have yet to see a good HIE story...
<Alchemist> NocturnalBlade: because he wants to slaughter it and eat it
<Klumzeedragon> Polydunami: D'aaaaaw. That Derp Face~<3
<CCCP> NocturnalBlade so i can hug her when im cold
<Polydunami> Because the idea of HIE is constantly misused :|
<OneTrickPony> Pikachu: here is my OC http://one-trickpony.deviantart.com/#/d55n5fr
<Alchemist> HIE?
<NocturnalBlade> CCCP: awwww Alchemist :(
<Polydunami> Humans in Equestria
<Alchemist> ahh
<Alchemist> thanks :)
<Eli> humans in equestria

<Alchemist> hmm

<Alchemist> thought it was content
<Vivix> Original Character, created by you
<Pikachu> ohs
<Vivix> depends on the context Alchemist
<Obsidian> Hey everypony.

<Alchemist> Vivix: yeah, I saw it being used in a couple of situations
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Obsidian!
<Kandarihu> What does HIE stand for?
<Vivix> Human in Equestria
<Kandarihu> Oooh. I see.
<Shizuka> 13aka author insertion
<Vivix> I generally don't read it, because I don't want humans in my equestria
<Vivix> but some are claiemd to be great
<Shizuka> 13aka NEEEEEEEEEERDS
<shibaru> I'm pretty good at talking to myself c:
<Polydunami> Turnabout Storm
<Vivix> Zooooolovers
<Cades> me too haha, whenever i play games i talk to myself as though im doing a commentary
<LadyCanary> .3.
<Eli> Kandarihu: usually used in fanfics... and usually used reallly badly... like to have the author have a ship with one of the mane
<OneTrickPony> o hai LadyCanary
<Shizuka> 13canary canary~<3
<CCCP> OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUL
<Vivix> It is usually pretty bad, like a crusade against Celestia and such
<Obsidian> Hello LadyCanary
<Vivix> but some are probably good
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu ;3
<Polydunami> Okay, that's a pitfall in and of itself, Eli xP

<Everlasting_Joy> Caramel: It happens.
<Obsidian> Hello SpadeMagnes[R]
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I am done with school today...finally
<Eli> Polydunami: it's why i ALWAYS turn of "human" tag on fimfic
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also I may have gotten my parents to consider getting me a 3DS XL
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[R]: Good luck
<Polydunami> I always go by ratings whenever I want to read a good fic
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Not positive on that...
<Polydunami> Or manga
<shibaru> Haha x3
<Vivix> I ignore ratings and read synopsis-
<Vivix> sometimes if a fic is controversial it will have tons of negative ratings despite not being bad
<Vivix> thumbing content rather than quality
<shibaru> Brb I hungry
<Applejack2012> hi
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I read anything really
<Cades> k
<Eli> Polydunami: not me. i like to find something good by myself. (not hipster)

<Alchemist> Vivix: same with pictures. If the pic is sonic related it will die in a hail of thumbs downs...
<alexxm> bye Pikachu
<Applejack2012> nye
<Vivix> Alchemist, yeah- so sometimes the rating system is just too broken to trust
<OneTrickPony> see ya Pikachu
<CountDoofus> Dammit! I can't look at the moon anymore without going "Hey, Luna."
<Vivix> tag and describe your stories well, beacuse sometimes that's all you have to go by to find a fic
<Masdragonflare> Just finished drawing Rainbow Dash

<CCCP> That spider scared me
<Klumzeedragon> Masdragonflare: Share? :P

<Polydunami> Well, do something about the fear.

<Eli> spiders are cute
<Applejack2012> cant stand spiders
<Polydunami> It's not spiders for me, but bees.
<Reikim> Why the FUCK can't I have this game in English?
<Alchemist> spiders are freaks of nature and should be exterminated
<Everlasting_Joy> I love spiders!
<Eli> i don't like insects in general, but i'm not afraid of any of them...
<Polydunami> Alchemist -_(\

<Reikim> Your beam is too slow for Jeremiah Motherfucking Gottwald's LOYALTY!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Man I have to wait 2-3 weeks before I can play Mists of Pandaria
<MadSurge> Caramel: it's very much like the Binding of Isaac that way :D
<Reikim> Why have I not watched all these series
<Everlasting_Joy> Holy crap that mech is huge!
<Reikim> Explode, BITCH.
<Reikim> I'm just waiting for Gurren Lagann to roll into action. This fanboying you see? Merely a warmup.
<MadSurge> Awww, no Boss Borot though :(

<MadSurge> Good ol' fisticuffs
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: You control over 100+, I think.
<Applejack2012> Only one has Canterlot Voice
<Caramel> Bronysith: who do you think I am, Raditz?
<Caramel> AJIsAwesome: 102 to be correct
<Bronysith> Caramel: yes
<Reikim> Really, no need for Canterlot today.
<Reikim> These mecha pilots have used up the Canterlot quota for the day.
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Now that's just insulting, calling him Radditz.
<Everlasting_Joy> *Raditz.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: would you rather me call him yamcha?
<MadSurge> Did you watch all the anime these robots come from Caramel?
<Polydunami> Loran? Rolan?
<Caramel> I don't know who this Yamcha is, but he sounds disappointing
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: . . .Touche.
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: :D
<Reikim> They are continuing into reserve allcaps stocks, and soon they will be running off of raw hotblood.
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: how are you aniki?
<Reikim> Hey there
<Bronysith> Reikim: and my other aniki
<Reikim> Getter Robo says HI.
<MadSurge> GO NAGAO

<AJIsAwesome> I felt SO bad for Yamcha. I wanted to end up being Top Dog at the end of the series. :D
<NocturnalBlade> the akuma of robots
<Reikim> Eldritch abomination from outer space? FUCK THAT I HAVE SPIRIT.

<Vordox> Caramel: Still not hard mode? D: how close are you?
<Caramel> 39/51 SR points
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: I'm messed up. This week has started on Tuesday, I think it's Wednesday, it feels like Monday, and I'm waiting for it to be Thursday (homework due).
<Polydunami> Setsuko?
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: wow
<Reikim> Ahaha
<Reikim> I forgot how much I missed this genre.
*Reikim feels full of LIFE again
<Vordox> Caramel: So about... 12 more maps?
<Caramel> if I get an SR point in each, yes
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: Yep.

<Bronysith> Caramel: you can never have enough drills
<Everlasting_Joy> AJIsAwesome: :D
<Michael> CrimsonPeewee: IKR?
<Vordox> Caramel: ... <.< Is there a Music Library for this game? How many songs are in it?
<Caramel> there is
<Reikim> Oh my god
<Caramel> I can't quite remember
<Bronysith> Reikim: sorairo days makes me feel...alive, like i can do anything, like i can PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH MY DRILL
<MadSurge> PINK IS MANLY
<Reikim> If I could just have this game's soundtrack

<Dark_Horst> amazingly enough, it survived being cut in half
<Vordox> Caramel: I may too anyway XD but no rush

<Michael> hahahahahah
<Polydunami> Also, Simon!
<Reikim> ENOUGH DRILL THERE SIMON?!?
<CrimsonPeewee> HOLY SHIT
<Michael> all the explosions
<MadSurge> Do all of these attacks get used in their respective anime?
<AJIsAwesome> SO MANY DRILLS. :D
<Caramel> madsurge: yes
<Bronysith> Reikim: he would reply NEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEER
<Caramel> hmmm
<MadSurge> ENCORE
<Caramel> dare I waste this one time attack on trash?
<Caramel> but it so epic
<Reikim> MadSurge: Most, yeah. Some don't make it. TTGL, for example, has a whole bunch of attacks that would never make it due to sheer awesome.
<Caramel> Reikim: orly?
<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: DOn't waste it. Save it.
<Reikim> Caramel: Use it on final boss.
<Caramel> well then, looks like I'm using it now
<Shizuka> 13http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92diwrpXU1r193uvo1_500.jpg so apparently sentry busters use demoman hitboxes
<Caramel> to make a point!
<MadSurge> Reikim: I can imagine :D
<Polydunami> Everything has its time and place.
<Reikim> Caramel: Anything done by anything larger than Gurren Lagann.
<Caramel> Reikim: watch and learn
<shibaru> Again
*Reikim is watching
<MadSurge> HOW DARES HE
*Bronysith hands Reikim popcorn
<Reikim> It hit?
<desertman2> That one actually hit
<Reikim> A PUNISHMENT IS IN ORDER
<Caramel> aha, oh god that was funny
<Michael> NOTHING CAN DAMAGE GL
<Vordox> Caramel: HISATSU?
<Vordox> Or not
<Caramel> they have a chance to freeze your counter attacks :P
<Reikim> What
<Reikim> So
<MadSurge> :D
<Reikim> It didn't work?
<Caramel> so next time :P
<Vordox> Lawl, Caramel got pwned
<AJIsAwesome> What? :O
<Caramel> no see, the way this works
<Reikim> I'm gonna say it one last time.
<Bronysith> ALL THESE ROBOTS MAKE ME EXCITED...
<Bronysith> have to clean up the mess
<Caramel> in one turn, the more times a mech is attacked, the less evasion it gets
<Reikim> WHY CAN'T I HAVE THIS GAME IN ENGLISH?!?!
<MadSurge> Let others have their glory!
<Michael> lol
<Reikim> Caramel: Ah, that makes sense.
<Caramel> so even your most evasive mechs can get hit if enough people focus them
<Vordox> Reikim: Cause World
<Michael> dat level
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: One word. Licnsing.
<Reikim> Vordox: Then the world...IS WRONG.
<Vordox> ...did it just implode?
<shibaru> Again
<Reikim> I know licensing...it makes me so sad.
<AJIsAwesome> *Licensing*
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Me too. :(
<Reikim> I would totally fund AGTP if they could get me a translated copy of this game.
<Caramel> just as an fyi
<shibaru> Again
<Caramel> this mech, ganleon, brasta, esther and margerat are all the OCs in this
<Reikim> Ganleon is my new favourite OG.
<shibaru> He's dying so much, maybe I should stop saying when he died lol
<Reikim> That theme song is about fifty shades of cool.
<Vordox> MAKINASHu!
<Polydunami> Rolo?
<Vordox> OH YOU DEAR ATTACK GUNLEON!?
<Reikim> GAAAAAALEON
<Vordox> FECK YE
<Caramel> Makinaize*
<Vordox> Caramel: I go by ear :P
<Caramel> and I correct your ear :P
<Vordox> And stream quality sound
<Reikim> NOT EVEN HIS MOST POWERFUL ATTACK
<Vordox> Super Press indeed
<Michael> need a more epic attack muahahaahah
<Reikim> I don't care what they have to do, they have to give Ganleon his own anime.
<Reikim> I DEMAND IT.
<Caramel> Reikim: they have OG animes after every game
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> AWESOME
<Caramel> so it's possible they will
<Reikim> Yesssss
<Polydunami> It's not Makenaize?
<Caramel> this one is the only exception, because it's a 3 game series
<Caramel> Polydunami: if that's how it's spelled
<Cades> whats he playing?
<Reikim> Sounds like "makinaze" or somesuch
<Polydunami> Oh, Setsuko.

<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I was getting some lunch and one of the cafeteria staff said "Sure, anything for a fellow brony."
<Polydunami> I voted LONG before EQD posted that article :P
<Ponies47> sub06905: One day I'll wear a brony shirt to school. ONE DAY. :p

<Reikim> Okay Caramel, you win.
<MadSurge> ... I didn't understand that attack
*Bronysith smacks MadSurge with a drill
<Michael> need someone to stream TTGL anime
<Kandarihu> MLP_Brovakiin, if you don't know why they're so strict about the uniforms, it's impossible to reach a good solution to the problem.
<Reikim> MadSurge: He summoned a city-sized battleship, merged with it, and then smacked the enemy out of time and space. Not all that hard to understand.
<Caramel> Michael: I already did
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: He punched it so hard it broke through space time.
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Aw. :P The poor derpy hooves. I haven't seen any bronies around and I live in California. I'd have thought I'd see plenty.
<MadSurge> CrimsonPeewee: not yet, because of lazyness and no Netflix availability
<CrimsonPeewee> Pfft
<Michael> Caramel: lol, when?
<CrimsonPeewee> why do you need netflix
<pony_7007> I don't understand understand whats going on!
<Caramel> a while back
<CrimsonPeewee> just torrent it
<Rommulus> I am glad that I was introduced by a group of bronies so I am not on my own.
<Michael> darn :(
<ShadowDash> 3
<Michael> i wanted to watch it on BS :(
<Reikim> These poor bastards just don't stand a chance.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kandarihu: They just want to keep a good rep, even though the school its self is full of jerks and people that don't care about their education
<Reikim> Is that
<Reikim> A second mecha?
<Vordox> Caramel: Mech on a mech on a mech?
<Kandarihu> MLP_Brovakiin, well, that makes sense.
<Klumzeedragon> Lyra used Rubber Duck. Everypony D'aaaaawed.
<Reikim> Holy shit dat combo
<NocturnalBlade> d'aaaaaaaw
<Vordox> Caramel: Gotta love how all Macross are translated to song lyrics :D
<Reikim> Soooo much guitar
<Reikim> HARMONY
<Michael> wat
<Vordox> Caramel: Wait, does it mean that Macross has the MOST music of one single mecha? XD
<Kandarihu> Vordox, that's Nekki Basara, protagonist of Macross 7, who is a total pacifist.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: ... Beat people with music?
<Reikim> Yeah, Dynamite 7 was weird.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: TOTAL PACIFICS?T XD
<Kandarihu> Vordox, BEAT them? Heck no! He plays his music for ally and enemy alike.
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Might be an interesting anime...
<Kandarihu> Vordox, it's a wierd series.
<CrimsonPeewee> Vordox, Elite Beat Agents dance to save the world
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Hehe
<Polydunami> Polydunami confuses Elite Beat Agents with Angel Beats constantly :S
<Rustymeat> dat Big O
<Michael> dat is a cool arm
<NocturnalBlade> i never knew Big O had that!?
<Rommulus> That Lyra is so cute, cant look away.
<Vordox> Caramel: Wait, isn't that Big O? Wasn't there a "human" version of Big O somewhere? Think I've seen that part(Was epic)
<Reikim> Okay, so the animation here is just plain awesome.
<Reikim> Now think.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its a reference to the monty python rabbit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It has 72 mil hp and if you some how manage to kill it it drops a pet
<Rommulus> ooooh

<MadSurge> Did I hear right, that Big-O is more philosophical than action-ey?
*sub06905 doesnt have BF3 Premium
<Polydunami> Right, I'll be back later.
<Klumzeedragon> BaconMane: Shame you're on PS3 I'd love to pwn some noobs with you. :D

<Reikim> alexxm: It was in the series too.
<Reikim> Night NocturnalBlade
<Kandarihu> Reikim, from Mazinger Z. I don't know everything about it, but it's pilot, Borot, seems to be a bully where Kabuto Koji go to school. But he TRIES to help him against Dr. Hell's <forgot the name of his machines>. Borot is very much sort of a cosmic chewtoy sort of fallguy. And his machine is traditionally portrayed in this game as comically pathetic.
<Obsidian> Bye NocturnalBlade
<Michael> bye NocturnalBlade
<Rommulus> Bye NocturnalBlade have a good one
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye NocturnalBlade

<Rommulus> nice
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: yay! :D
<Klumzeedragon> sub06905: Oh? I was thinking that was how it would work, but that just sounds silly. I was hoping you could fly it. :S

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Still no release date yet? Or that one sumi showed was true.
<MadSurge> DED
<Rommulus> wow 1 letter off

<Reikim> Kallen shows off the massive range she suddenly got.

<Bronysith> Reikim: cause only sephiroth can use that blade
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: how much did it cost?
<DJ_POn-3> hey everypony how are y'all
<Rommulus> I bet if we combine all our money then rob a bank we could adopt one.
<Reikim> This game has enough explosions to give Michael Bay an existential crisis.
<Klumzeedragon> How big is that Gunblade Bronysith?

<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: celestia made twilight cry. i will find her and tear her horn off, then her wings and give them to twilight
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Then you'll make Twilight cry. You monster.
<Rommulus> I support this twilight_sprinkle
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i wont tell her its from celestia
<Petrified_Discord> Wait a minute...is that robot just a guy sitting in a chair? That. Is. Boss.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: She'll still cry. Mangles ponies don't exactly appeal.
<Michael> http://derpy.me/bRlxV twilightception
<Reikim> Petrified_Discord: *throne
<Rommulus> That is awesome, twilight reading twilight
<Klumzeedragon> Hm... I have to go get my dad a birthday card. I'll be back my little ponies~ :P
<Rommulus> which is till a better love story then twilight
<Reikim> Why does this guy sound like Lordgenome?
<JESmith71> twilight_sprinkle: Or you do like they did in that Sunset fanfic and use a Divinity Spell and steal Celestia's powers and give them to Twilight which would make her an alicorb
<Obsidian> Bye Klumzeedragon
<JESmith71> alicorn
<Rommulus> Bye Klumzeedragon

<Reikim> That is one hell of a robot
<Kandarihu> Ah, the return of the guy who's machine gives a speech during each attack. Awesome stuff
<Petrified_Discord> Alicorn on the Cob
<Obsidian> Miss

<CrimsonPeewee> http://i.imgur.com/CRhmg.jpg
<Reikim> Hell, my stream's not working.
<Reikim> But I saw ARC GURREN LAGANN so it's all cool.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo tinfoil hats anyone ? http://www.teamfortress.com/mannwill/
<Reikim> And GAAAAANLEOOOOON
<Caramel> have you tried refreshing?
<Reikim> Meh
<Reikim> How is everyone, anyway?
<Lyon> Ok I have to ask: what I
<Reikim> Yes
<Lyon> ´am watching?
<Reikim> My connection's just fallen off
<Caramel> ah
<desertman2> Lyon: SRW
<Reikim> Wish I could watch, but sadly, I can't.
<Caramel> sad, you didn't even get to see the final boss
<Reikim> But that's okay. Any more testosterone and I probably would have exploded WHAT
<Michael> http://derpy.me/Ng4NH dawww
*Reikim mashes the refresh button
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: HNNNNGGGGG
<Lyon> wow the title speaks for itself...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tired
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and you ?
<Reikim> All rihgt.
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Where did you get that picture?
<Reikim> *right
<Reikim> Ahaha it works now
<Reikim> YES
<Michael> AJIsAwesome: facebook :)
<Lyon> Go Super Robots¡
<AJIsAwesome> Michael: Okay. Nice!
<CrimsonPeewee> Michael, that's well done
<Brad[Laptop]> Michael thats a pretty good photoshop
<Brad[Laptop]> Have you guys seen the dude who greenscreens ponies into his house on youtube
<Reikim> GO
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: I have.
<Michael> ponies IRL are awesome .)
<Reikim> GURREN LAGANN
<Brad[Laptop]> its pretty well done as well
<Brad[Laptop]> I mean, you could make a movie out of it.
<CrimsonPeewee> Brad[Laptop], I won't say good photoshop
<Reikim> Still can't do damage?
<CrimsonPeewee> that's pretty basice
<Reikim> Dat's BS.
<CrimsonPeewee> basic**
<Caramel> not really
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: There's more than one. I'v actually seen about 5 people do the same thing and it looks great.
<Michael> dat would cost a good quantity of money
<Caramel> the more you hit his shield, the less he murders your team
<Brad[Laptop]> AJIsAwesome ah guess i need to search for more
<CrimsonPeewee> but the guy did thought about the picture and took care of details right
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: They're on youtube. Look up complations of ponies IRL
<Brad[Laptop]> I guess it helps that the show itself is easy to remove the background and stuff due to simple shapes and colours
<Petrified_Discord> HAX.
<AJIsAwesome> *compilations*
<CountDoofus> Goodnight, everybrony.
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: Or just skill. :D
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: Night! :)

<CrimsonPeewee> heeeh sort of
<Caramel> Gaioh (or however the hell it's spelled), and his army of interdimensional beasts
<desertman2> Someone who looks like Akuma
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone, my bastard mum made me wake up at 6:30 to see if I could get up and ready for school on time when I go back -_-
<Petrified_Discord> Akuma the robot master
<Spitfire> Caramel: is this the last level?
<Reikim> Sadly, we'll never get an official pronunciation.
<Caramel> yes
<Petrified_Discord> MLP_Brovakiin: Yay parents

<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Night! :)

<Spitfire> you kewl
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Petrified_Discord , Ponies47 and AJIsAwesome :3
<Kandarihu> Brad[Laptop], the key is to imagine it being 3D. I think that's how it works.
<sub06905> MYAH!
<DJ_POn-3> Goodnight MLP_Brovakiin:
<Brad[Laptop]> Kandarihu I mean for when you stick ponies into photos of our world

<Sumica> 00,10I am well
<Michael> ohai Sumica

<Sumica> 00,10type 7 spinzaku as well
<Reikim> Also
<FillyMena> hmm]
<Reikim> Briefly, there was an Arc-Gurren Lagann

<Michael> http://derpy.me/hzHTW
<Kandarihu> Sumica, that's Big O. Did I hear "Ou Blade"?
<Reikim> God, this animation is almost as long as Supernova's.
<CrimsonPeewee> I wonder if this beats Supernova in the longest attack animation
<Petrified_Discord> ...So his attack was turning the planet to lava?
<Caramel> btw, just going to put it out there
<Caramel> that was 1/4th of its actual damage
<Caramel> I had barrier up
<Reikim> ...
<desertman2> ouch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why do most final bosses have super flashy attacks
<Obsidian> Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
<Rommulus> ooooh I see
<Reikim> Try not to get hit again?
<Caramel> nah, this time I have wall up
<Caramel> if Rolo gets hit, it'll only do 10
<Sumica> 00,10it's in the union by laws SpadeMagnes[R]
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R]: Flash, like screaming, is directly proportional to power
<Michael> http://derpy.me/VGYgG all of my want
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: To be fair, the protags get a hell of a lot too.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Get some new moves
<CrimsonPeewee> Michael, I'm sorry but that a bad design
<Spitfire> terrible design
<Michael> CrimsonPeewee: the picture in the sirt is cool
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: and lack of clothing on females increases survival rates
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: They dodge better. CLEARLY.
<Spitfire> Michael: not really >.>
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If only if we understood japanese
<FillyFlam> I can't remember if I said hi when I came in here.
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: True, but only in theory, as no female ever has ever worn sufficient armor :P
<FillyFlam> So, hi.
<CrimsonPeewee> I can't say it's horribl but the picture isn't made for a good t-shirt
<twilight_sprinkle> Petrified_Discord: lol true
<Obsidian> Hello FillyFlam
<Kandarihu> I love this boss music. It's so elegant
<Michael> ohai FillyFlam
<Caramel> well he is the king of the world
<AJIsAwesome> FillyFlam: Hi! :)
<Kinixys> Hai ponies.
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: Hi! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi FillyFlam
<Petrified_Discord> Is anyone else loving how silly the final boss looks?
<Reikim> Yeah
<AJIsAwesome> He needs more attacks.
<Reikim> Just skip godbot's attacks from now on, I guess.
<Spitfire> lol Caramel got tired of seeing it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its starting to get dull with the same cutscene over and over
<twilight_sprinkle> Spitfire: about time tbh..
<Spitfire> yush
<Petrified_Discord> Ded
<Caramel> hits me with a 15% hitrate
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well shit
<Reikim> Oh shit
<Caramel> good god
<twilight_sprinkle> ded
<Reikim> Well
<Obsidian> Now hes just skipping the animations
<Reikim> What now?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So much for her
<Reikim> GANLEON, AVENGE
<Spitfire> Caramel: are you going to skip his death animation? :<
<Caramel> what? no
<otakon> tenshin?
<Spitfire> yay
<Caramel> I figured he'd miss with a 15% hitrate
<Obsidian> Vengence!
<Caramel> just got really unlucky it seems
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is this like fire emblem and the character is gone for good?
<otakon> GO GIANT WRENCH ATTACK!
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: no
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: it's just a credit penalty at the end of the stage
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: but the better the unit, the higher the penalty
<Obsidian> skip
<otakon> KING KITTAN!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why does the king of the world have only one attack?
<Bronysith> inb4 otakon is kicked
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: bc that's all he needs
<otakon> BUFF TIME!
<Kandarihu> PLANET DANCE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have no idea what is going on..
<otakon> LYRA BUFF GO!
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: shits exploding yo
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: it's an ability that recovers a lot of health
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: for a lot of units

<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: because who the fuck is egoraptor to take 1575 bucks for an autograph. i can get a Federer autograph on ebay for that much
<Rommulus> why it no use different move that isnt that one XD
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony!

<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, it's a drawing of anything, signed, mailed (not emailed) and all that for some center for horse
<desertman2> more than that
<Buytoast> holy shit when did ganondorf get a rob ot
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Lol dodged
<otakon> good dodge
<Reikim> Suzaku gives zero fucks.
<AJIsAwesome> As much as I like Egoraptor, I have to agree with twilight_sprinkle.
<CrimsonPeewee> true it is her mom working in there but still it's sort of nice
<Sumica> 00,10odd, BerryPunch should have beaten wrek on that
<otakon> Caramel: you're normal types are taking damage man, get them OUT of there
<CrimsonPeewee> it's not all on his wallet
<CrimsonPeewee> and the goddamn auction started at 0
<otakon> HAX!
<CrimsonPeewee> so if you have anyone to blame you blame the people not ego
<AJIsAwesome> Egoraptor may be a good writer/animator, but he's asking for a LOT of money he doesn't need.
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: like i said, i can get a ton of autographs of famous people with actual talent for that much...
<Spitfire> AJIsAwesome: thats what the current bid is
<CrimsonPeewee> Oh god He started at Zero
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Flee rolo flee
<CrimsonPeewee> and it's not for him
<Reikim> Behold the Internet

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys :)
<twilight_sprinkle> LunerRepublicGuard: there was a boss in ff7:cc who had ??? hp and she took 20-40 minutes(depending on difficulty) to kill with maximum game damage
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile the god machine is sitting there biding his time
<OtakuTom> IIRC, there's a program being used to transfer the video/audio straight from the PSP to the PC for the stream. Any idea what program that is, and if it also works for the Vita? I'd love to record and stream some of my games, especially Hatsune Miku Project Diva F
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Mirando or something, right?
<Sumica> 00,10dat lions over kill
<Kinixys> This is as long as FF summons. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: no i dont think so, it was the secret goddess boss
<Reikim> OtakuTom: There's a cable that turns PSP screen into a standard video cable.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: That's who I was referring to.
<Fluttershy6194> Lyra!
<Sumica> 00,10orange time

<Sumica> 00,10Jeramya gotswald, the only beaing more loyal then AJ
<OtakuTom> Or maybe I could just bug Caramel after the stream...lol

<Caramel> you can't get more loyal than Jeremiah
<Sumica> 00,10So loyal even death wont stop him
<Dovah> Sumica: huh? i thought RD was loyalty and AJ what honesty..
<Reikim> True facts from Sumi.
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: I know. He was one of my favorite characters from that show.
<LunerRepublicGuard> twilight_sprinkle: not completely
<Vivix> Their elements are part of them, but they're not onetrack ponies
<Sumica> 00,10that's the joke Dovah
<Sumica> 00,10watch more FiW
*Vivix never has--
<Caramel> good
<Caramel> don't
*Vivix copmlies
<Reikim> Ugh
<Vivix> cinokue..
<Dovah> I know I should I'm just too lazy
<Vivix> FUCK!
<Reikim> Less argument please
<twilight_sprinkle> LunerRepublicGuard: wow lol. it was hard enough on easy
<Vivix> COMPLIES*
<Reikim> Let's just focus on the giant robots here.
*Vivix can't type properly today
<CCCP> NomOmomomomom
<Vivix> What's going on in here? Just got back
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not into FiW. It may be funny to others and I can see why, but it's just not my cup of tea.
<cachi01|phone> Hi CCCP :)
<Petrified_Discord> Vivix: Robots. Big ones.
<Vivix> Oh, that-anime?
<Sumica> 00,10that dont look like the 303
<Petrified_Discord> Vivix: More like all of them :P
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome, yeah that's what I think I will feel if I see it- I'm..not sure it sounds like the thing I'd like
<Caramel> it's not unfortunately
<otakon> go Holland!
<Vivix> Ooh
<Caramel> the 303 is only in Hakai Hen unfortunately
<otakon> goddammit STILL 25K to do?
<Caramel> you used to be able to choose between the two
<Caramel> but for some reason they didn't let you in this
<Caramel> which made me had a sad
<otakon> Caramel: don't you have any attacks that do 30K worth of damage? your losing units man!
*Vivix turns on stream
<Petrified_Discord> Oshit
<Sumica> 00,10oh dear
<Caramel> it's a boss with high armor, and is massive, which means it takes even less damage
<otakon> bye Holland
<Reikim> Oh my god just DIE already.
<Caramel> there's no way I'm hitting him for 30k
<Caramel> and nah, holland is fine
<CrimsonPeewee> Purple Tinker....left?
<otakon> Caramel: wait when did Massive size impart damage resistance?
<Caramel> since...always?
<Vivix> Coincidence: Dovah, I'm listening to a song where the chorus sounds like it goes "dovah dovah dovah"
<LunerRepublicGuard> looking at this makes me wanna play that dragon rpg game on the PSOne
<Caramel> there's an ability you can buy to ignore that penalty
<Vivix> It always makes me think of you Dovah
<Dovah> Vivix: lol whats the name of the song?
<otakon> Caramel: no really, I didn't know Massive guy got damage resistance, does tha go for your Battleship units too? they're usualy massive (LL) as well)
<Vivix> Dovah Battle by Blur
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shrugs off the lava
<Caramel> no, battleships don't get it
<otakon> HAX
<Caramel> but they usually have their own special defenses
<otakon> figures
<Reikim> They're final bosses, otakon. Can't really complain.
<Vivix> the chorus starts at around 1:20 Dovah
<Dovah> Vivix: and now i have a song to go listen to
<Vivix> hehe
<otakon> Reikim: I bet you 1 MILLION bits it's not.
<Sumica> 00,10spinzaku time
<Reikim> otakon: Final bosses plural. I already know there's more.
<Vivix> 1:05*
<otakon> anyway off to see if I missed a job application
<Petrified_Discord> He's in the red!
<Obsidian> otakon: See ya
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Bye! Good Luck! :)

<otakon> Vivix: no no, I mean after he beats this stage there is gonna be another boss

<AJIsAwesome> Caramel: What? WHy? :(
<Obsidian> its a hit
<Reikim> Caramel: Why? I can't see.
<Sumica> 00,10some people can sit on it and spin
<Cades> yay!
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: WHAT? HOW???
<otakon> Caramel: I wonder why, it was more enjoyable then Eureka Seven.
<Vivix> Never seen either-
<DJ_POn-3> when are we going to watch more mlp episodes just asking
<Vivix> DJ_POn-3, probably this weekend
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I recommend you check out Code Geass more.
<AJIsAwesome> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<twilight_sprinkle> oNE DOES NOT SIMLY DISLIKE CODE GEASS. i didnt intend that as caps but still

<DJ_POn-3> alrighty
<Reikim> DJ_POn-3: Movie night, Friday, or Saturday morning if you want the Euro stream.
<Sumica> 00,10did some one just ask for ponies?
<otakon> argh Eureka Seven i know you like it Caramel but it had some of the most unlikable characters I've ever watched in an anime.
<Vivix> I've only seen Y of Geass- so know tiny parts of the story-
<otakon> Sumica: no
<Caramel> then you have no taste
*Reikim otakon clearly has not watched a lot of anime
<Obsidian> Sumica: eenope
<Cades> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sumica> 00,10Sure looked like a request for ponies
<Vivix> Honest! It was just someone asking for when <,<
<AJIsAwesome> No, no one requested for ponies!
<LunerRepublicGuard> voltron?
<PillowPoni> Nobody asking for ponies. Nope
<AJIsAwesome> Right, guys?
<Vivix> Right!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yep
<PillowPoni> Right
<OtakuTom> I've really been meaning to watch Eureka 7. I didn't like Geass all too much.
<Reikim> Honestly though, why would we get complaints for Geass? I don't get it.
<LadyCanary> mfw Val is still streaming.
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: Correct
<sub06905> yes we all requested Gen 3.6 pomies
<LadyCanary> Holy shit.
<sub06905> ponies*
<Lyon> Yep, no ponies here
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: :(
<otakon> Caramel: most of the character are assholes for no reason besides the sake of being assholes.
<PillowPoni> sub06905, shut up
<Sumica> 00,10this guy look like a OC mech
<sub06905> :D
<Vivix> Woah
<LadyCanary> LOL Sumi
<Caramel> otakon: then you aren't paying attention. Nothing more to say
<shibaru> I wonder what Mike's doin 8)
<Vivix> Is this a game?
<LadyCanary> Yes
*Vivix so confused
<desertman2> yes
<Reikim> Sumica: I don't think it is. Looks like a Gundam to me.
<AJIsAwesome> YES! FINALLY HE'S DEAD!
<Obsidian> Finally!
<Reikim> God is dead. And we have killed him.
<otakon> Caramel: how am I not paying attention? Renton gets treated like absolute shit in the first 12 episodes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yay~
<Lyon> Sayonara, Baby
<Obsidian> Mission Complete...almost
<crazypony> yaaaaay
<Sumica> 00,10No I meen one of the SRW orignal mechs Reikim
<Caramel> for one, it's called hazing. Secondly, he over exaggerates how he's treated
<Reikim> Sumica: I know, and I think it's a Gundam.
<LunerRepublicGuard> what a royal pain
<Sumica> 00,10they have there own mech's to fill out the rosters
<twilight_sprinkle> aand ofc i missed his death
<Reikim> Wait
<Reikim> Infighting?
<Caramel> Reikim: That was Brasta, the main character
<Sumica> 00,10not dead
<Vivix> Hazing? I probably wouldn't like it either-
<Reikim> Caramel: Ah, okay. Nvm then.
<LunerRepublicGuard> PUNS R fun :)
<Reikim> Probably intentionally looks like a Gundam, really.
<Spitfire> Caramel: are they fighting eachother?
<Vivix> I might check ou Geass- but I rarely watch any anime
<otakon> Caramel: hazing is still a horrible damn practice.
<Vivix> last time is ..5 years ago? other than stream
<Petrified_Discord> Wait, why is he attacking Akuma?
<Lyon> Drop dead already!
<otakon> wait
<Caramel> Spitfire: No, he's forcing Gaioh to reveal his full power
<otakon> waht?!
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: code geass is best anime
<Spitfire> Caramel: oh
<Reikim> That wasn't even...his final form?
<otakon> big bad fighting OTHER big bad?
<Vivix> Or actually I did see Deathnote on TV, otehr than that -yeah

<FillyFlam> I'm sure this cutscene is freaking epic for people who can read Japanese.
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: altho if you just like action, you might not like it. it has good action, but a lot of story and character focus too
<Sumica> 00,10damn he had another guy

<Reikim> Who's this one?
<Reikim> The one riding a dragon.
<Kandarihu> I swear, 90% of the time I watch this, he's fighting mooks. If not mooks, he's fighting just those two specific enemies.
<LyraTheMedic> caramel = valthejean?
<Sumica> 00,10Getterrobo I presume
<cachi01|phone> Psicologists are stupid douchebags..........

<LunerRepublicGuard> pudding?
<Sumica> 00,10death by gigapudding
<Lyncast> why is there a giant flan monster?
<Kandarihu> Until it can be positively identified, it's just a killer MMMM.
<Reikim> No! Yoko!
<Obsidian> Lyncast: Anime
<Kandarihu> Giant killer MMMM
<Bronysith> Reikim: dont worry, her boobies will protect her
<Lyon> I told you all: It´s a rainbow colored godzilla ciborg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why ISNT there a giant flan monster?
<OtakuTom> I turn away for just a brief moment, then I turn back and find Yoko...I have no problems with that...lol
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], well, this is Super ROBOT Wars. Not Super big giant stuff that's usually but not always a Robot Wars
<Lyncast> lyra, get out of that fireball, its not for seaponys
<Lyon> Seapony Lyra: soon....
<Reikim> Who's this guy?
<Sumica> 00,10gundamn wing, but been to long to recall the mech
<Kandarihu> Shenlong Gundam
<OtakuTom> It's some version of Shenlong
<Lyra`> how many dragon thingys are there?
<Reikim> Someday I'll get around to watching Gundam. Then I'll be able to name all the mechs.
<Obsidian> Lyra`: Two left
<Sumica> 00,10mech with dreadlocks, seems legit
<Lyra`> thats too many, just saying.
<Fluttershy6194> :)
<Reikim> Overman King Gainer.
<Kandarihu> Reikim, there are a lot of series. And a lot of them are alternate universes.
<Caramel> dont you insult King Gainer!
<Sumica> 00,10good luck Reikim
<LunerRepublicGuard> did I see gundam epyon?
<Sumica> 00,10they have alot of gundamns
<shibaru> "Shibaru is in a tragedy shoujo manga. " Yup. definitely
<Reikim> We're not, Caramel. We're complimenting its awesomeness.
<Lyra`> so this is multiverse gundam extravaganza? kind of like the episode of pwower rangers where it was a teamm full of red rangers?
<CrimsonPeewee> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9qx61qEC81qaplb5o1_500.png
<OtakuTom> I want to rewatch Wing and then finally catch SEED and 00. I guess I should try to find the DVDs for those fast, since Bandai is stopping their distribution.
<Sumica> 00,10ewww seed
<Kandarihu> The first series I watched was the English dub of Gundam Wing. I totally didn't know it was an AU series.
<Reikim> What was wrong with Seed?
<pony_PpegasisterLOL> what we watchin
<Sumica> 00,10it's a soapopra with mechs
*Reikim has never seen most of the gundams
<Reikim> I think...
<Sumica> 00,10every one is in a contest to try and out emo the last guy
<Reikim> The only Gundam I've ever completely seen was Zeta, and only because it came in movie form.
<shibaru> "Cades is in a harem yaoi manga. " Oh my.
<Reikim> Even then, four hours.
<JESmith71> Lyra So is the Dynasty Warriors Gundam games. They're even more multiverse than this game
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<LunerRepublicGuard> O_O
<Lyra`> oof
<Kandarihu> Lyra`, that analogy only fits if you include Kamen Rider, Metal Heroes, and a whole bunch of other Tokustatsu series that also have nothing to do with Super Sentai in this.
<Lyra`> dynasty wars :(
<OtakuTom> Oooh...I just remembered 08th MS Team...that was another one of my favorites.
<Kandarihu> JESmith71, if it has Gundam in the name, it's probably less multiverse than this.
<Reikim> I'm still looking for a good copy of Char's Counterattack, simply because Nu Gundam was awesome in Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2.
<CCCP> Poop
<Sumica> 00,10the icon for the blackknights flag ship always cracks me up
<Sumica> 00,10it looks like a fish wearing a pirate hat
<shibaru> "Cynder7 is in a fantasy hentai doujinshi. "
<pony_PpegasisterLOL> >_>
<Reikim> Great, thanks Sumi, now I can't unsee that.
<pony_PpegasisterLOL> liarjack
<otakon> i'm back
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I believe it's the Ikaruga

<LunerRepublicGuard> friendship cannon?
<Cynder7> 6Heya ^^
<otakon> dammit why couldn't he blow up the pretty boy?
<otakon> trans-am?
<CCCP> I like th taste of seed
<Reikim> Sumica: Hey, if I were to pick a Gundam to start with, which would be the best? And shortest.
<otakon> does he have a 6 cyclinder engine?
<Bronysith> otakon: cause animes and their pretty boys
<CCCP> If you kno what I mean...
<shibaru> And you're in one too.... -sigh-
<otakon> Reikim: 08th MS Team is a good one
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Obsidian> uh oh, Universe bots turn

<Bronysith> otakon: they are making an easy mode for dark souls. thoughts?
<Reikim> Ah
<OtakuTom> Yea, 08th MS team is a good one to start out with. It's only 12 or 13 episodes.
<otakon> Sumica: what's the one where basically ...well nuclearweapons gundam
<Lyra`> OOOOtakon <3
<otakon> Bronysith: it doesn't need it
<CCCP> Lyra lol
<Lyon> final final boss
<Sumica> 00,10ms08 is good
<Reikim> The last 52-ep anime I watched was Soul Eater. Haven't been able to since then.
<Lyra`> how do i register this name?
<otakon> Bronysith: if only they got rid of the cheapness that is the anor londo archer
<Sumica> 00,10ot taht sounds like wing
<shibaru> "Spyrorocks is in a gender bender shounen manga. "
<CCCP> Twilight_sprinkle nothing.... ;)
<Bronysith> otakon: the director is doing it for better sales
<Cynder7> 6xDD
<otakon> Lyra`: use /msg nickserv register "nick" "email" iirc
<ShadowQuill> Just came here to say I hate Howard Stern. First, he says all bronies are cloppers, and THEN, he goes and makes a kid cry on national TV. WTF, man?!
<otakon> Bronysith: FOR SHAME
<Lyra`> /
<Caramel> otakon: false
<otakon> ShadowQuill: shock value
<otakon> Caramel: well I SAID IIRC
<shibaru> Who next? XD
<CrimsonPeewee> how long has he been on that mission?
<Reikim> Rainbow Godbot is...kind of corny.
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: He
<Caramel> it's /msg nickserv register password email
<Bronysith> otakon: cause the "difficulty intimidates and makes people not want to play the game"
<otakon> and obviously I was rwong
<Cynder7> 6Kimori :P
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: He's a joke. Don't even listen to him.
<Kimori> ?
<Cynder7> 6HA!
<otakon> Bronysith: the ONLY game I won't play bc of difficulty is SMB
<Bronysith> otakon: thats the point, WEED OUT CASUALS

<Sumica> 00,10from the surface
<Reikim> Sumica: Is this a thing that happened in the series? Like, actually happened?
<Cynder7> 6Shonen is a mixture of most genres,isn't it?
<CrimsonPeewee> this mission is beyond overboard
<CrimsonPeewee> like seriously

<SpadeMagnes[R]> <.<
<Cades> is this music or something?
<Cynder7> 6Has a bit of action,adventure,comedy,drama and shizzle.. or something :P
<Cynder7> 6Manga :P
<Cades> or books
<Cades> ah ok
<otakon> oh look
<Sumica> 00,10this is another one from 00
<shibaru> It's mostly action and fantasy i think xD
<otakon> it's the GunCannon revision
<Lyra`> and it does shit for damage.
<Lyra`> it sucks
<Cynder7> 6*sigh* Brb..I need to drag myself to my room to get my earphones... ._.
<Lyra`> and lyra <3
<otakon> Lyra`: it's a opener and every little bit helps
<Cades> lol
<otakon> welp he's dead
<Reikim> Lyra`: This is the final boss we're talking about here. Everything is going to do shit for damage.
<CrimsonPeewee> ...
<CrimsonPeewee> ouch
<Sumica> 00,10that was't a power attack
<otakon> damn
<otakon> one more hit like that and he's toast
<Sumica> 00,10did't even go trans-am
<Caramel> 47% chance lockon dies
<Caramel> let's see if the RNG likes me
<shibaru> "Mike is in a psychological shounen manga. " Accurate.
<otakon> Caramel: he's so dead
<Lyra`> i remember this one
<otakon> RNG in these situations have fucked me over so MANY times
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is this guy build like a brick shithouse?
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok we have a spare lockon
<CCCP> What
<Cynder7> 6Ok,torture is over. :D
<otakon> Me: 90% chance to hit
<Caramel> lol sumica, this IS the spare :P
<otakon> >misses
<Sumica> 00,10lolwoops
<Caramel> and he lives!
<otakon> Enemy: 10% chance to hit
<Obsidian> he so ded
<otakon> >hits
<otakon> so MANY times
<Reikim> Aaaand Lockon lives.
<thelonepony> Nope
<Obsidian> Hey he lives
<shibaru> Hmmm... who next....
<otakon> GODDAMN LUCKY BASTARD
<Sumica> 00,10gigapuddie
<Lyra`> elements of harmony are pretty inaccurate
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hate games that dont tell me how close to death a boss is
<Cynder7> 6dari?
<Cades> i thought we agreed on kimori?
<otakon> Caramel: you need to pull back your wounded units man
<thelonepony> and Gigapuddie is back
<otakon> okay the HELL is that thing?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It gets annoying
<otakon> seriously
<otakon> the FUCK was that thing?
<CCCP> Gigapiddi!! :D
<Caramel> otakon: you need to not tell me how to play my game man
<LunerRepublicGuard> :D
<otakon> Caramel: just a suggestion
<Lyra`> caramel, make them hug and make up :3
<Cynder7> 6Oh yeah..wait,Kimori's been done..
<otakon> if only Lyra`
<otakon> MAZINGER!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Cynder7> 6That sounds kinda weird..
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: We can infer based on how much of the bar he loses for the damage he takes. I'm guessing right now, 400 000 to 500 000 health.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oo2xr/
<Cynder7> 6Meh,you know what I mean..
<Cades> ok haha, idk what ur talking about, just ignore me :P
<otakon> Mazinger Z!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The story would probably be more engaging if anyof us understood japanese
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: agreed
<Lyra`> wtf is that thing?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Definitely.
<Kimori> I'm really not keeping up sorry, am working on homework
<Reikim> Shit
<Lyra`> it is hideous
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Reikim> Revising estimates
<Cynder7> 6:O
<otakon> Lyra`: A giant super robot that transforms itself into a giant fist to do damage
<shibaru> Lol
<Reikim> Looks like something around 1 000 000 HP.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The game looks fun but it seems bland without understanding the dialouge
<OtakuTom> I was thinking something around 1 million hp
<shibaru> Got distracted by tumblr
<AJIsAwesome> If only they released an English patch like they did with Mother 3.
<Spitfire> ded
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], definitely, but that means that Caramel would have to take a lot longer whenever the dialog pops up
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea I guess
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel is still kicking ass? :D
<shibaru> TUMBLR'S ALWAYS DISTRACTING ME!!!
<Lyra`> imma throw the univers at that bitch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Teleport rush!
<Lyra`> *universe
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, are you aware of how much trouble that patch took to make?
<Shamroc> ded>

<Reikim> Gotta love Wall.

<Caramel> tried to find the charger in time
<otakon> Caramel: video cable crap out again?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah :(
<Lyra`> nice rollercoaster tycoon, btw
<Reikim> Caramel: How bad is it? Did you save?
<LunerRepublicGuard> :l
<Caramel> so close to the end too
<Sumica> 00,10doahith
<SpadeMagnes[R]> All that progress lost

<Reikim> Well. Shit.
<Spitfire> lol Sumica
<Caramel> it does, but you have to quit out of it to do so
<PillowPoni> Sweetie Belle: OH COME ON!
<otakon> Caramel: dammit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Now we have to do that all over
<Lyra`> OR
<otakon> Caramel: that truly TRULY sucks man, this will be the THIRD time you'll have to fight that boss again
<Lyra`> we can watch him play warioparty
<Kandarihu> Hmm, WAITING, it says in the lower right hand corner
<Reikim> Yes
<Reikim> Caramel: /)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> YES
<Fluttershy6194> :)
<otakon> Caramel: maybe just get to the final hit of the final boss and quit/save and show us on stream?
<Kandarihu> Is this a physical PSP or an emulator he's got?
<otakon> PSP
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Real thing.
<otakon> hell i should get a PSP emulator
<LunerRepublicGuard> *crys 4 my PSP* so many memories

<Ryunosuke> the world was esentially dieing
<otakon> there yu are
<otakon> Lyra`: I thought you got kicked
<Ryunosuke> he destroyed towns for shits and giggles
<Reikim> The only thing that annoys me about Duodecim is that the removed the ability to break combos with EX mode.
<Lyra`> did i?
<otakon> they should have put Sora in this for shits and giggles
<twilight_sprinkle> also its funny how sephiroths moves are worse in hard mode
<Lyra`> my computer has been acting weird
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: What has Lyra` been doing? I haven't been paying attention.
<otakon> Lyra`: maybe, the client likes to kick for colors and underlines
<Sumica> 00,10Gonna see if I can get 00 gundam in english for stream

*Bronysith puts a slug in Sumica s ear
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I'm getting periodic freezing again.

<Sumica> 00,10Nyaa.eu
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: thats a reference to a bad game and you should feel bad
<otakon> Bronysith: hmmm good question. My favorite is Steiner tbh but "best" hero overall has to be Terra for sure
<Reikim> ...Huh, I've been here before.
<Buytoast> i may have never played any final fantasy, but are those kefka and sephiroth fighting?
<twilight_sprinkle> desertman2: basically the numbers mean how much damage your attack will do. there are attacks that lower those numbers or that do direct damage
<Cades> *literal dance*
<Spitfire> YOU'LL BE WELL DONE
<OtakuTom> The english dub is also available through Crunchyroll
<Dken2021> Buytoast ja
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Yep.
<Buytoast> what kind of ass pandering game is this?
<AJIsAwesome> How is Dissidia? Is it good?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah man

<Ponies47> You join a PF2 server and the nas so as you get out on the battlefeild and nopony is fighting insted they are making a giant tower outta each other :P
*Cynder7 6refuses to stand up if it is not necessary.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Not where I am. Scorching hot here. :|
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: unfortunately the rain here was lame and only lasted 30 minutes <.<

<Cynder7> 6Kimi wa kimi dake shika inai yo..... ♪
<Cynder7> 6BWAHA
<DJ_POn-3> AJIsAwesome: ya ikr
<twilight_sprinkle> from what i saw in the demo and from watching now, sephiroth seems terrible underpowered in this game
<Ponies47> Ohai Nittany_Discord
<Dken2021> DJ_POn-3 still somewhat better than me
<CrimsonPeewee> dat HP
<Reikim> Sumica: How do you tell what kind of translation they've got?
<AJIsAwesome> So BREAK is when you can deal direct damage right?
<DJ_POn-3> Dken2021:what did ypu make :)
<Bronysith> otakon: why must sephiroths blade BE 7 FUCKING FEET LONG?!
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: no break is when your attack numbers go below zero
<DJ_POn-3> *you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes Ponies47?
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: your opponent gets a bonus for that
<Fluttershy6194> Has anypony played Slender?
<LunerRepublicGuard> its going to suck if sephiroth gets EX
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: I said hi :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Rommulus> Fluttershy6194: yes
<AJIsAwesome> So how do you deal direct damage?
<Rain> is this the first or second disidia game?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hi aniki i am back from dragoncon

<Lyra`> Nittany_Discord!, im ban evading, get me :3
<Lyra`> im a bad girl :3
<twilight_sprinkle> kefka is op
<Fluttershy6194> Is Slender a scary game?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yep. :D
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ogod why https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/644654_4660472676291_1130321691_n.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> and sephiroth is so underpowered...
<DJ_POn-3> Nittany_Discord: how are you and welcome
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttershy6194: It's more shock than scary. Plus there's no point to it.
<Lyra`> Nittany_Discord, babe, dont ignore me, i thought we had something special :(
<Rommulus> Fluttershy6194: not if you play it at day time with happy music.
<Fluttershy6194> :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome well there are 2 attacks ya can do. Bravery *Circle* takes numbers off the enemy's Brave *Numbers on top of health* and Direct *Square* does the amount in Brave *4421=4421 damage to HP*
<twilight_sprinkle> lol does sephiroth have 1hp
<CrimsonPeewee> >1
<Rain> break is when they cant do shit to you
<otakon> damn
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Okay. Thanks. :)
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: he has last chance
<Buytoast> boy this fight is dragging out longer than a search for a missing white child from a wealthy influential family
<Reikim> Who's Val fighting against/as?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and as long as you have brave points you don't take health damage
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: why did they make sephiroth so weak in this game <.<
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i know the system
<Bronysith> VICTORY FOR THE BEST VILLAIN
<LunerRepublicGuard> ;)
<Ryunosuke> you know
<otakon> Reikim: fighting Sephiroth as Kefka
<CrimsonPeewee> Kuja is best villain
<Reikim> Ah
<Ryunosuke> Kefka = the Joker of Final Fantasy
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: so weak?
<Rain> is this Dysidia 1 or 2?
<desertman2> 2
<otakon> 012
<Rain> ah
<Rain> damn
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome no prob :$ kinda played this alot before trading in my psp,man i need to get it on psn for my vita now! :D

<Bronysith> Caramel: RELEVANCY http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/Gunblade-325318033?q=gallery%3Abronysith&qo=0
<Rain> because Squall is a fucking badass
<desertman2> why not?
<LunerRepublicGuard> leon
<Ryunosuke> Reikim, I disagree
<Reikim> Squall was also completely broken in the first game.

<Ryunosuke> what?
<Dken2021> how does a gunblade even function?
<Bronysith> I JUST STARTED 8 NO SPOILERS PLEASE
<Reikim> CrimsonPeewee: I only say that because in the first game he had infinite Beat Fang combos. I defeated soooo many bosses that way.

*Ponies47 Hugs oni_link back "You are not going to believe what I found while playing MvM yesterday!"
<Rain> Zidan is also a fun character to play as
<otakon> I did NOT expect him to voice Chaos
<CrimsonPeewee> I would like Warrior of Light more
<Bronysith> otakon: why are gunblades awesome?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol otakon you silly when ya fangasm :D
<otakon> Bronysith: bc they're cool looking
*The_Weird_Ass 4is bored.
<Ryunosuke> CrimsonPeewee, I think dissidia needs more Black Belt :)
<oni_link> Ponies47: hehe I probably wont until I see it. what is it??
<CrimsonPeewee> otakon, who's voicing Chaos?
<Dken2021> Bronysith becasue they have a confusing concept
<Rommulus> Does anyone know of a psp emulator?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i was like that too the first time i play this :$
<oni_link> I so want to play these games...
<Ponies47> oni_link: I found the high five taunt! :3
<Rain> why are you doing bravery attacks when you are in break?
<shibaru> The weird ass is bored
<Rain> they do nothing and an HP attack gets you out of break
<oni_link> Ponies47: wow, for reals?? :o
<FillyFlam> CrimsonPeewee: I forget the guy's name, but he's Captain Anderson from Mass Effect.
<otakon> damn
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i hate divine punishment and soul of oblivion
<desertman2> woah
<CrimsonPeewee> oh....mass effect
<Ponies47> oni_link: For reals :3

<Reikim> Fun fact: Cecil is played by...someone.
<CrimsonPeewee> oh not yet
<Reikim> I forgot who.
<LunerRepublicGuard> :O
<Reikim> DAMMIT.
<Ponies47> oni_link: You can high five me the next time we play. :3
<otakon> Reikim: probably Steve blum
<CrimsonPeewee> Reikim, imdb
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol everytime he does that kick it sounds like he's sayin "BULL SHI-!" :D
<DoombringerZero> Cecil is Yuri Lowenthal
<Cynder7> get sum
<LunerRepublicGuard> keith david in a japanese game :O
<Reikim> YURI LOWENTHAL
<oni_link> Ponies47: awesome! :) I was really tempted to buy that taunt XD
<CrimsonPeewee> http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0523180/
<Reikim> That was who.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i LOVE this song!
<Cades> Hello there. ^^
<Ryunosuke> Chaos is a wierd villian in that he is more of a powerful summon more than anythiing
<shibaru> XD
<CrimsonPeewee> Cecil is Prince of Persia
<shibaru> Shit just got confusing
<Cades> xD
<Cynder7> :o
<Dken2021> Chaos wasn't even that hard of a final boss in the first game
<Ponies47> oni_link: I couldn't believe you can find that taunt. But I guess you can. It's just all luck.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> imagine if G4 and G1 had to team Dissidia style to fight Chaos o_0
<otakon> Dken2021: well in the absolute ORIGINAL version he was
<Cades> You should see how confusing it had gotten a while back..we had all changed our names and were impersonating whatever we could think of..
<CrimsonPeewee> Sketch_Toku_Brony, you mean Discord?
<otakon> bc of limited healing items/magic/cure all of his HP bull
<Cynder7> haha
<Reikim> In Dissidia, Chaos is a goddamn asshole.
<Cades> Sec,I'll send the screenies :P
<Cynder7> k
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CrimsonPeewee lol no i mean THIS Chaos
<oni_link> Ponies47: I think I wanna buy it XD that was soooo lucky though!
<NullRadix> otakon: and the giant dungeon you had to go through before him
<CrimsonPeewee> Sketch_Toku_Brony, horrible crossover
<Dken2021> well duh, that game was pretty much unplaytested and had stats that didn't; work
<NullRadix> otakon: which, if you didn't have a cleric, you couldn't leave and come back
<Ponies47> oni_link: IKR? :p
<otakon> NullRadix: and the random boss battles
<Ryunosuke> think of it like this
<Dken2021> Limit Break!
<NullRadix> oh no, boss battles weren't random
<otakon> dat timing
<twilight_sprinkle> huh uhh huh uhhh huh uhhh
<Ryunosuke> Chaos ... = Discord :)
<Rain> Val, if you had the first one, we could play over Adhoc (assuming you also have a ps3)
<Brad_> woot got my graduation certificate in the mail
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CrimsonPeewee yeah Discord and maybe that G1 guy would be neat to fight?
<NullRadix> there were specific tiles on the floor that had the boss battles

<oni_link> everytime I look at this game, I think of Sanity Not Included :D
<CrimsonPeewee> Tirak I believe
<Rustymeat> I have no idea whats going on stream
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah i think so
<oni_link> Ponies47: yeah, I tried making a new weapon and it wasnt worth it
<Captain_Hitsugaya> 11Idk why,but my current nickname amuses me.
<Ryunosuke> he's not so much out to distroy anythiing per se, it is just out to spread... Chaos.. .and Discord :)
<oni_link> I lost sandvich
<Ponies47> oni_link: Oh dear :S
<CrimsonPeewee> oni_link, that's simple you only saw sample of this game in that webshow
<Rustymeat> oh my
<otakon> oh Shit
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man Feral Chaos was CRAZY in Scenario 00
<otakon> dat's a BIGGUN
<Bronysith> otakon: NOT BIG ENOUGH

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah and then it gets all Pony Laggan! :D
<Bronysith> otakon: link it
<Reikim> I remember it took me AGES to figure out how to avoid all of Chaos' attacks.
<otakon> http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/109/109993.jpg Shizuka uh huh!
<Rain> and here comes the kill shot
<otakon> damn that hurt
<Shizuka> 13well
<oni_link> Ponies47: I do if im playing by myself but i can do without it. I never got around to asking you what the specs for your desktop were now that I remembered.
<Dken2021> Firaja?
<otakon> more like Flare
<Shizuka> 13it's a close resemblance
<shibaru> "Penis is in a gender bender josei manga. " PENIS IS NOW KNOWN AS VAGINA
<twilight_sprinkle> all these characters make think why in hell is sephiroth so much weaker than all of them
<otakon> which was the big non-elemental kill spell before Ultima and Meteor showed up
<shibaru> I dunno lol
<Reikim> See, this is why you need a character like Warrior of Light with his brave-to-HP combos.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: bc he's a clone/virus mix with pearly white hair?
<Cynder7> woah, mindfuck O_o
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, because he never did anything for himself
<Bronysith> lol
<otakon> dammit again?
<oni_link> otakon: I remember flare! I saw it in FFX
<otakon> DODGE!
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: but hes an awesome clone/virus with pearly hair >:I
<Uncapainfied_Hitsugaya> 11xDDD gender bend failsus!
<Reikim> I love this attack
<Reikim> So much fun
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: -___-
<Reikim> Nope, val..
<Rustymeat> ouch
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, there are way more better villains than sephiroth
<desertman2> You rolled into the attack
<Dken2021> so is he almot dead yet?
<otakon> Shizuka: also I saw another charcter with that name..in Queen's Blade. She's an oni...
<CrimsonPeewee> sephiroth just got insane and obsess with his mother
*Dken2021 shivers
<CrimsonPeewee> he's a mommyboy
<Shizuka> 13shizuka ist not an uncommon name silly filly
*Bored_Hitsugaya 11is bored.
<sub06905> what game is this?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Finally
*Dken2021 when queen's blade is mentioned
<Ponies47> oni_link: 2.60 GB processer, 1 terabit of memory (Also have a external hard drive to gimme extra 500 GB) and 6 gigabit's of ram :3
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: maybe, but he was one of the first ones with a story like his. and hes still awesome. hes certainly better than any other character in ff7
<Reikim> otakon: ...You watched Queen's Blade.
<otakon> Reikim: on impulse
<Ryunosuke> DISCORD
<Rommulus> Discord's dream hell yeya

<Dovah> queen's blade... the memories :)
<oni_link> Ponies47: is it a Intel or AMD processor? and what about the Graphics? also, thats pretty good :P
<Rawket> I love seapony Lyra.
<otakon> Reikim: no I stopped just before the opening ended actually
<Dken2021> watching queen's blade on inpulse wha?
*sub06905 has intel graphics
<Reikim> Sure, otakon.

<otakon> I learned from the horror of Eiken club
<Rustymeat> so what game is this?
*Reikim continues to be disbelieving.
<otakon> THE HORROR
<DrSteveSCARz|OnBF3> im back, i miss anything... magic
<otakon> so much blantant fanservice can ruin it for a guy
*oni_link hugs sub06905

<Reikim> Mm-hm.
*sub06905 hugs oni_link
<LunerRepublicGuard> *need to see 2nd season queens blade*
<twilight_sprinkle> funny how vita has no awesome games like this
<otakon> cratorkid: Queen's Blade, very fanservice heavy anime.
<Reikim> Ha!
<LunerRepublicGuard> ^
<otakon> it's on Crackle but their service sucks
<cratorkid> otakon: heards about it , its f'ing hentai
<otakon> Reikim: what?
<sub06905> intel graphics can handle games quite well :I
<Reikim> QB isn't fanservice-heavy. It's fanservice INCARNATE.
<oni_link> I haventt been compelled to buy a Vita. I have a 3DS and that just collects dust too..
<otakon> cratorkid: actually no it's not, not a single sex scene
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> twilight_sprinkle :( its gonna have sly cooper... :$
<otakon> cratorkid: at most it's ecchi bc just boobs and butts
<Reikim> otakon: How do you know?
<Cades> cynder7, u know any other people that used to come here?
<CrimsonPeewee> oni_link, I play my ambassador GBA games right now :3c
<otakon> Reikim: bc it's not listed as hentai IIRC
<LunerRepublicGuard> otakon: crackle sucks because of the ADs
<otakon> LunerRepublicGuard: it sucks bc it won't load
<cratorkid> otakon: like kiss x sis , it might as well be
<CrimsonPeewee> and also play Theathrythm cause I'm a suck-up on rhythm games
<OtakuTom> Yea, Queen's Blade isn't hentai as much as it is ecchi
<cratorkid> otakon: that sh*t was weird
<CrimsonPeewee> AND Final Fantasy has gorgeous music
<Dken2021> ah, we have Final fantasy's batman
<otakon> I don't know it
<oni_link> CrimsonPeewee: I lost my GBA and all I have is Sapphire :/ I miss it
<You_Just_Spoke_To_Yourself> 11Yeah,quite a few :P
<otakon> Dken2021: Kain?
<Dken2021> ya
<Reikim> CrimsonPeewee: Nobuo Uematsu. Wins.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh this character
<twilight_sprinkle> hes cool
<otakon> and then he was Sean Connery?
<otakon> NICE MUSIC
<twilight_sprinkle> and le awesome musics
<CrimsonPeewee> Noduo Uematsu...oh that's the guy that compose FF music
<otakon> He sounds like Sean Connery
<Rain> is that Cecil?
<twilight_sprinkle> i wish i hadnt broken my psp <.<
<Cades> you shud get em to come back here
<CrimsonPeewee> this stage....
<CrimsonPeewee> I hate it so much
<CrimsonPeewee> Oh hey
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: Nobuo Uematsu and he left with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Akira Toriyam to make Mistwalker studios
<LunerRepublicGuard> twilight_sprinkle: same here
<CrimsonPeewee> Chaos is now a furry
<Josh_Klinghoffer> 4Sec,let me see if any are on msn..
<CrimsonPeewee> oh
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: you haven't seen Freya Cresent have you?
<Rain> jump is now an attack
<Reikim> I never could master Cecil.
<CrimsonPeewee> Come on Jump
<twilight_sprinkle> one of the few stages sephirorh is actually dangerous...
<CrimsonPeewee> otakon, Freya wha?
<cratorkid> ^
<Josh_Klinghoffer> 4I'd check fb but I can't be seen online at this hour,especially since I'm supposed to be exhausted.
<Reikim> otakon: Actually, Uematsu's doing his own thing, though he's working heavily with Sakaguchi.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sephiroth is over rated
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: FFIX, Freya Crescent was a Dragoon in it.
<otakon> what SpadeMagnes[R] said
<Rain> MIMIC. god I love that one~
<CrimsonPeewee> oooooh
<Reikim> The WORST stage in Dissidia, though, has to be Planet's Core. TOO DAMN SMALL.
<CrimsonPeewee> I like my Kain more though
<Josh_Klinghoffer> 4There's no one on..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Jesus
<CrimsonPeewee> JUMP KAIN JUMP
<Rain> wooo
<twilight_sprinkle> yes yes, i know hating sephiroth is popular nowadays. i think ill avoid the bandwagon thankyouverymuch
<CrimsonPeewee> you didn't....jump
<CrimsonPeewee> ;-;
*sub06905 laptop cant handle minesweeper >_>
<desertman2> He jumped a lot of time
<oni_link> yikes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Feral Chaos' EX is CRAZY
<Dken2021> Kain would totally be a pegasus
<cratorkid> sub06905: dafuq?
<Reikim> Caramel: Play as Tifa.
<Rain> I remember that they made the weapon master nut suck as much in this one
<LunerRepublicGuard> gaara y u in ff?
<CrimsonPeewee> Oh shit
<twilight_sprinkle> gaara was kewl
<CrimsonPeewee> lolwat matchup
<Rain> not*
<Bronysith> TERRA <#
<oni_link> I wanna see how fast Tidus can be :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Doesnt this game pull a dick move in the tutorial that makes you fight Feral Chaos?
<Bronysith> terra <3
<Dovah> blood with a hint of leamon is good :)
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: If you claim you're confident.
<CrimsonPeewee> Bronysith, calm your fan-gasm down a lil bit
<Cades> aw :( ok
<twilight_sprinkle> terras super mode is being nude :D
<OtakuTom> I love me some Terra :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thats sych a asshole move though
<Bronysith> CrimsonPeewee: NEVAH
<Ponies47> oni_link: Intel and HD 6530D graphics (I hope I got that right :S)
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, furry nude?
<Reikim> Um

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_o
<LunerRepublicGuard> wtf
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: idk, somewhat? she looks mostly human
<OtakuTom> Her theme is also my single favorite song in the franchise, followed by Dancing Mad and Liberi Fatali
<CrimsonPeewee> THAT MOVE
<LunerRepublicGuard> long range magic users

<Dken2021> heheh
<twilight_sprinkle> WHERE???
<Bronysith> DJ_POn-3: STOP TAKING MY JOB

<twilight_sprinkle> Rustymeat: WHERE GODDAMNIT
<DJ_POn-3> Bronysith: what i posted back before
<Rustymeat> HERE
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wuts your favorite EX in Duodeium Caramel?
*Arrowed_In_The_Knee 9has been arrowed in the knee
<shibaru> I think this is the part where I fell asleep XD
<Reikim> Haax! She dodged out of Tornado! That's impossible!
<twilight_sprinkle> FFFFFFUUUUUUUU
<Rustymeat> dat lyra
<twilight_sprinkle> or maybe shes saying hear
<Factory_Of_Faith> 4D:
<oni_link> Ponies47: do you know how much Video memory that thing has?
<twilight_sprinkle> or maybe heir
<otakon> you know of ALL the characters in the FF series
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Bear
<twilight_sprinkle> near
<otakon> they could have had WAY more character
<twilight_sprinkle> leer
<twilight_sprinkle> beer
<otakon> or at least more skins
<twilight_sprinkle> fear
<Spectrum_Rush> snear
<oni_link> gear
<twilight_sprinkle> queer
<Ponies47> oni_link: I forget ;_;
<twilight_sprinkle> peer
<Reikim> otakon: DLC. Also, making movesets is difficult, see Fighting is Magic.
<OtakuTom> Is this the first game or the sequel?
<PillowPoni> beer
<Buytoast> why is power girl fighting alextraza?
<twilight_sprinkle> tear
<CrimsonPeewee> FFIV is best FF cause you could visit Luna
<WindWhistler> For some reason I thought this was one of those 3D Touhou fighters.
<Bronysith> Buytoast: cause terra is best final fantasy hero
<oni_link> Ponies47: aw its alright, have you messed around with your resolution on TF2 though?
<Reikim> I will still maintain that FF5 is my favourite.
<CrimsonPeewee> WindWhistler, there's no 3d Touhou fighter
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon irk? i wanted at least Auron or even Wedge and Biggs *as joke characters* i mean even Zell from FF8
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPeewee: Yeah. They're just fangames though.
<CrimsonPeewee> Reikim, interesting choice
<Reikim> CrimsonPeewee: Actually...there is.
<WindWhistler> not official
<Reikim> Well, yeah
<OtakuTom> VI has been my favorite ever since the first time I played it.
<Reikim> CrimsonPeewee: I just love it. Especially the system.
<oni_link> I still need to play the older 8 and 16 bit games...
<Random_Hitsugaya> 11DEAR GOT
<Random_Hitsugaya> 11FAIL
<Ponies47> oni_link: Nope. Works just fine :P
<WindWhistler> Well anyways I'm gonna go practice my cello.
<Random_Hitsugaya> 11*DEAR GOD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some one die allready
<Lyra`> meh
<Lyra`> rawr
<Lyra`> takes WAY too long
<Dken2021> oh, is there an actual 3d touhou fighting game? cause if so, the fans are very dedicated
<twilight_sprinkle> darkness of gravity
<Barbetos> This dissidia?
<Spectrum_Rush> sphere
<twilight_sprinkle> Barbetos: indeed
<oni_link> Ponies47: thats awesome :) how much did you end up spending?
<Renji_Abarai> 4ROAR ZABIMARU
<Barbetos> Hah. Thats funny. I have NEVER seen this game ever.
<Barbetos> Just a few pics
<CrimsonPeewee> for now Touhou is still vastly dedicated to their thing then Brony
<twilight_sprinkle> i played the demo
<Spectrum_Rush> brigadier
<CrimsonPeewee> vastly more
<Barbetos> The music gives it away
<twilight_sprinkle> twas lotsa fun. minus sephiroth being weak as hell
<Ponies47> oni_link: About $500 (Thing was on sale)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah EX~!
*WindWhistler hums Lavender Town music to give everyone nightmares
<twilight_sprinkle> also i hated garland
<twilight_sprinkle> dat lyra
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Sephiroth gets deadly if you give him the right moves. Same with Garland.
<oni_link> Ponies47: oh cool. I still have to wait awhile longer to get mine
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, dem blocks?
<Ponies47> oni_link: Awww. :<
<oni_link> maybe like next month
<sub06905> the Lavender Town music gives Freddy Kruger nightmares
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: well garland is very strong. but sephiroth? i dont see how, his bravery attacks are so weak compared to others, and on hard he doesnt even have his aoe
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sigh
<Senbonzakura> 13WAZZUP DUUUUDES!?
<oni_link> Ponies47: its alright though, by then Ill have it and then I can sell this laptop too.
<desertman2> zzzzz
<Ponies47> oni_link: Yay! :3
<twilight_sprinkle> ultima is fun move
<Dken2021> Esper!
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: That's the thing. You're playing with premade movesets. In the full game you can control what moves he gets. He's fast and has quite good range, with the right moveset.
<twilight_sprinkle> nude mode!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> YEAH
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: You also get equips that increase power and so on.
<CrimsonPeewee> YES
<CrimsonPeewee> THAT FINISH
<desertman2> finally
<LunerRepublicGuard> at the last second
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: ah, well maybe.i only played the demo. unfortunately my psp broke so thats that :(
<oni_link> Ponies47: I know, its gonna be awesome! Ill finally be able to run Skyrim and all my other games XD
<Reikim> Man, you guys like your furries.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some of these fights go on for way too fucking long
<oni_link> This girl is best Zora
<Dken2021> Reikim half furry to be exact
<Ponies47> oni_link: SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
<CrimsonPeewee> heeeh she looks more like a plant girl than anything
<twilight_sprinkle> oi Caramel play as sephiroth
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, the full game is much better. Although I, too, logged dozens of hours in the demo :)
<Caramel> spade: I haven't played in months, give me a break...jesus
<Cades> uhh guys, i turned on my computer and theres a bunch of colors and shit all over the screen
<Athgaar> some sort of final fantasy fighting game?
<CrimsonPeewee> Reikim, I am a furry
<Barbetos> Oh its Terra?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sorry Caramel
<Barbetos> Took me a second
<Reikim> Caramel: Tifa please?
<Dken2021> hai Athgaar, ya
<twilight_sprinkle> yaaay
<CrimsonPeewee> I want Gilgamesh
<LunerRepublicGuard> i am a furry reikim
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: "logged"?
<Cades> trying to take a pic of it but my phones being retarded
<CrimsonPeewee> Gilgamesh please
<twilight_sprinkle> ha
<twilight_sprinkle> wat a match up
<CrimsonPeewee> oh come one
<Saggy_Fruit> 7:O
<oni_link> Ponies47: haha I know! I cant wait. MvM lags bad when I have alotta of enemies on screen
<twilight_sprinkle> wouldve been funnier if it were sephiroth vs aerith
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Played. It's an affectation. The game logs your hours. Thus, I have "logged" x number of hours on a game.
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: I see what you did there XD
<CrimsonPeewee> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4569/
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: ah k. loved the demo, wish i had the chance to play the ful lversion, looks super
<Athgaar> level 100 sephiroth
<Cades> i think ill just leave it for now :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh look its that song...
<Athgaar> what's it holding
<Ryunosuke> mfw One Winged Angel
<LunerRepublicGuard> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh lux i knew i would love using that laser
<Dken2021> oh, perfect, even his theme's playing
<Bronysith> otakon: this is a kickass theme though right?
<twilight_sprinkle> say what you want about the villains, but one-winged angel is best villain song.
<Reikim> The Dissidia arrange is far and away the best.
<Saggy_Fruit> 7:3
<Athgaar> choice band sunnybeam sephiroth op
<CrimsonPeewee> I would laugh so hard if caramel makes himself lose on purpose
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A sword that long just seems counter productive
<Barbetos> Tifa has the potential to be the strongest character in ff7 most of the time.
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: As you can see, his Bravery attacks are fast and with little to no warning. He can eat your Brave with the best of them.
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: bitch please
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: eh, its like anime
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SEPHIROTH
<CrimsonPeewee> oh yeah
<CrimsonPeewee> that reminds me
<Dken2021> counter
<CrimsonPeewee> at the end of october I'm going at Video Games Live
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> love One winged angel
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: yeah but theyre so weak
<Lyra`> she is gettting her ass kicked
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: You ARE seeing the damage he's doing with it, right?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Suddenly Sora (／・ω・)
<Saggy_Fruit> 7Naked Flea ftw ._.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: other characters do like 4k bravery per hit
<cachi01|phone> Sora?
<LunerRepublicGuard> no limit break 4 u
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> uh its Vaan from FF12
<oni_link> Next we should see Tidus vs Jecht
<cachi01|phone> PLEASE DONT TELL ME IM MISSING A KH STREAM
<Athgaar> nope
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No
<twilight_sprinkle> "you look good"?
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: That's against underleveled characters. What you have to understand about Dissidia is that characters have levels and equipment.
<CrimsonPeewee> cachi01|phone, Dissidia
<cachi01|phone> phew
<twilight_sprinkle> is he hitting on her?
<Dken2021> cachi01|phone no dearie
<CrimsonPeewee> cachi01|phone, btw Dissidia>KH
<oni_link> chat derped... >.>
<OtakuTom> cachi01, now you've got me thinking of the one time I ever went up against Sephiroth in KH...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what the heck do you have to do to actualy put a dent in the health?
<twilight_sprinkle> preeeetty
<sub06905> ded
<Colt_Silver> M-M-M-M-MONSTERMILL!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: well i hope youre right, in the demo i was dissappointed *shrug*
<CrimsonPeewee> that took longer than expected
<Colt_Silver> KILL*
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee which dissidia? First one or duodecim?
<alexxm> shes ded
<CrimsonPeewee> for shame Sephiroth
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Waah
<Ryunosuke> Quack
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<CrimsonPeewee> both?
<OtakuTom> I went after him at something like level 40
<CrimsonPeewee> maybe Duodecim though
<Dken2021> Kweh?
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: The reason he sucks in Hard mode is because, well, it's hard mode, so the enemies are all higher-leveled. The only thing really annoying about Sephiroth is that his HP moves are really easy to counter.
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<CrimsonPeewee> since more characters and balance and all
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee i mean which is being streamed lol
<Bronysith> keep kicking ass Caramel
<OtakuTom> I lived long enough to get his health bar to start dropping...lol
<Ryunosuke> Onion knight!
<CrimsonPeewee> Duodecim
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Random!
<Reikim> Caramel: Tifa.
<desertman2> all random
<CrimsonPeewee> GILGAMESH
<LunerRepublicGuard> reikim is hard mode is so easy >_>
<Athgaar> knocking people all down
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: yeah and he loses his aoe move in hard mode, although his aoe move was weak as it is
<oni_link> Whooo Lightning was my second choice :3
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<CrimsonPeewee> lawl lightning
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Night! :)
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee btw dissidia = KH both are awesome :)
<oni_link> night Bronysith
<Dken2021> nighty Bronysith
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So whats the deal with the fat chocobo?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Bronysith
<cachi01|phone> Night bronysith
<LunerRepublicGuard> night bronysith
<sub06905> night Bronysith
<Bronysith> LIGHTING IS WORST HERO
<Pearly> hey everypony
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] it's...just a fat chocobo
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: AGAIN, that's because Hard mode gives you preset moves to make your life more difficult. Build him right in the main game and he's mid-tier.
<Dken2021> hai Pearly
<CrimsonPeewee> KH has more faggots
<LunerRepublicGuard> hey pearly
<SpadeMagnes[R]> <.<
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: aw but mid-tier is meh-tier :S
<cachi01|phone> BRB Bath
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: In Dissidia, any character's moveset is fully customizable. Down to inputs.
<Pearly> hey LunerRepublicGuard and Dken2021
<Pearly> how are you dears doin'?
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: If you want a high-tier character, learn to use Exdeath.
<Dken2021> swell Pearly, same for you?
<Caramel> does anyone remember the combo to change lightning's stances?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: i dont even know what that is :$
<Pearly> yup yup
<Reikim> Caramel: Right trigger.
<Reikim> Or
<Reikim> No
<LunerRepublicGuard> pearly: smashing
<twilight_sprinkle> screw you garland
<Reikim> Caramel: It's...uh...something to do with left or right trigger and a button.
<oni_link> speak of the devil, Planet's Core
<Athgaar> how is he over level 100
<Caramel> I want to say like, left trigger and circle
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee i cant beat the fucking emperor with yuna lol
<Caramel> but I don't remember
<Athgaar> what's the level cap
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: An ever tree and armour
<Reikim> Caramel: Sounds right.
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee im stuck in that part
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: man this game sounds like tons of fun
<Reikim> Athgaar: 100 for players, 150 for bosses/enemies.

<PillowPoni> Scoot-Scootaloo gets all the ladies.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> That acting...
<Reikim> So otakon has not been kicked in three days.
<Dken2021> she says spells so weird
<otakon> Reikim: no but by the mod bots
<Sumica> 00,10that reminds me

<PillowPoni> Hey Slendermane :3
<LunerRepublicGuard> hello slendermane :O
<otakon> Sumica: the hell why?
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: Point taken. haven't seen Teen Titans in a looooooooooooooong time
<otakon> like 6 in 10 isn't bad enough
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: me neither, liked that show.
<Barbetos> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9u5yhFAaA1ru5991o8_1280.jpg roflmao
<LadyCanary> :O ooooh!!
<Barbetos> omg that made my night
<thelonepony> hi Slendermane
<Dken2021> Barbetos poor discord
<LunerRepublicGuard> whats the numbers in the middle for?
<Dark92Enigma> LunerRepublicGuard: time limit
<LunerRepublicGuard> Oh
<Dark92Enigma> i guess
<desertman2> But it's going up
<Barbetos> Dken2021 his pain makes me so happy though, so eh.
<oni_link> Barbetos: haha aww that actually made me feel bad for Discord
<Sumica> 00,10numbers in middle are bonus damage for breaking
<Reikim> Whyyyy must GW2 update again?
<Dark92Enigma> LunerRepublicGuard: my mistake
<Dken2021> Barbetos but he had everything planned, then an annon ruined the surprise :(
<LadyCanary> Sumi Sumi :3
<Barbetos> oni_link I should feel bad for laughing my ass off, to the point of crying, but I am not.
<Barbetos> It makes me laugh harder if I think about it.
<Sumica> 00,10LadyCanary <3
<CrimsonPeewee> Barbetos, people would need to see the whole arc
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<Shizuka> 13canary canary~<3
<Sumica> 00,10Caramel is just toying with this guy
<CrimsonPeewee> but yeah that picture was awesome to end the arc
<OtakuTom> Because it shows that ArenaNet actually cares about how well the game runs these first few weeks after launch. I think they had a lot more people than expected.
<Reikim> LunerRepublicGuard: When you reduce an enemy's bravery below zero, you get that as a bonus. Most of the time it's constant based on both players' base Brave, but in some stages it fluctuates for various conditions.
<oni_link> Barbetos: I laughed too but I still felt a teeny bit guilty. Just a bit though :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Scoot Scootaloo~
<Caramel> sure...toying...
<Barbetos> CrimsonPeewee Sure, but alone it is still funny i think.
<Caramel> let's go with that <.< >.>
<LadyCanary> Scoots!
<Dken2021> kay....
<Sumica> 00,10he's waiting to get a full EX bar
<CrimsonPeewee> meh it question alot of stuff
<Dken2021> oh ello there LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Dken2021! :3
<CrimsonPeewee> sure seeing discord at that state is funny
<Cades> idk
<Dken2021> huh, 1 HP
<CCCP_> Huggy please
<CrimsonPeewee> but the whole story just elevated the humour like 10 000 time more
<shibaru> Last time I had this there was no problem. I had someone who liked me back, someone who also has a heart fetish... Someone who enjoyed hearing my heart as much as I enjoy having someone hear it...
<LunerRepublicGuard> reikim: never seen it when playing ffd
<OtakuTom> I still don't understand how health works in this game >_>
*twilight_sprinkle huggies CCCP_
<Barbetos> oni_link you shouldn't. Its all apart of his plan of chaos. Everything that discord does is deliberate. He is a chaotic being, who seems to make no sence whatsoever, but you can always count on him being what he is. <3 Discord.
<Reikim|GW2> LunerRepublicGuard: It's pretty important, not sure how you didn't...
<Dken2021> OtakuTom the health is that horizontal blue bar
<otakon> yeah
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: the smaller numvers on the bottom is health, and the bar
<otakon> you start with Brave Points
<oni_link> Barbetos: haha I have to make sure to not forget that
<cachi01|phone> Im back :)
<otakon> then when that's depleted it goes to health
<OtakuTom> Yea, I understand how to read the health meter, just not how health is gained or lost.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Barbetos: What's going on?
<twilight_sprinkle> OtakuTom: its not gained
<CrimsonPeewee> I want to see Gilgamesh in action
<otakon> you see Lightning has 122,377 health
<Athgaar> health is lost by getting hit
*CCCP_ huggies twilight_sprinkle
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> cachi01|phone: Welcome back! :)
<OtakuTom> Okay, so I take it then that brave points are the large number.
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: is he in this one?
<Reikim|GW2> OtakuTom: There are two types of attacks; Brave, and Health.
<CrimsonPeewee> yes
<Barbetos> UNLEASE THE FURRY!!
<otakon> no no NO
<LunerRepublicGuard> reikim: not very important when at a high level and playing on hard
<Reikim|GW2> OtakuTom: One saps Brave, the other does HP damage based on your Brave.
<otakon> no unleashing furries dammit
<twilight_sprinkle> does this game have Zach?
<otakon> no
<Reikim|GW2> LunerRepublicGuard: Yes, I know, I've been there, but I've still noticed.
<cachi01|phone> Reikim theres a part where u play with yuna and u find Tidus with an erased memory i think then u have to fight the emperor to save Tidus
<twilight_sprinkle> aw
<CrimsonPeewee> these matchups....
<Dken2021> ooh, GOlbez, Final fantasy's Darth Vader
<otakon> it doesn't have a lot of characters that would fit into a FIGHTING game
<Dark92Enigma> Discord reminds me of Slade from Teen Ttans.......think about it: both of them have NO MERCY nor COMPASSION nor ANY SYMPATHY over their victims. And that makes them Awesome villains in my book :)
<Barbetos> Oh nothing AJIsAwesome|Homework just my random musings. I try not to share the things I think often, and for good reason. Remember the "love and tolerance" incident? =P
<otakon> like Sabin
<CrimsonPeewee> Dken2021, lol
<XaviortheSavior> Hey, I just got this game! It's fun
<otakon> for GOD'S SAKE WHERE IS SABIN, YANG AND CYAN?
<OtakuTom> So the brave is the large font 4-digit number,and the larger that number is, the more health damage you'll deal when you do a health attack?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Barbetos: Oh, yes. I remember that. :S
<CrimsonPeewee> Dark92Enigma, though Slade test while Discord just flat out amuse himself
<otakon> OtakuTom: eeyup
<Reikim|GW2> cachi01|phone: Something like that. It's not all that bad. The new story in Dissidia was relatively easy.
<otakon> OtakuTom: it's also your shield against health damage in a sense
<Reikim|GW2> *Duodecim
<LadyCanary> What game was Laguna in? I dont recognize him
<otakon> hiya LadyCanary and 8
<desertman2> FF8
<Dken2021> 8 I think
<LadyCanary> Ah.
<otakon> LadyCanary: you like him don't you ^_^
<Barbetos> Long story short though, Discord is an awesome character concept, even if was barrowed from another show.
<Reikim|GW2> OtakuTom: otakon is confused. Brave does HP damage. It's not a shield, it's a sword.
<OtakuTom> Okay. That makes some sence, then. Even though I've played Dissidia, I just couldn't understand how the health worked...lol
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Barbetos: I honestly don't mind you sharing the things you think. It's nice that you express your opinions. :)
<LadyCanary> Didnt play much FF so I cant say, otakon.
<Dken2021> never played 8, or any playsation game
<Reikim|GW2> OtakuTom: You were right the first time.
<Barbetos> What is that guy doing in this?
<CrimsonPeewee> and pretty much most villain have no mercy nor compassion ano sympathy over their victim, thus why they are villains to begin with
<Ryunosuke> FF6 music
<twilight_sprinkle> wow full bar already
<Cades> :(
<oni_link> :/ i g2g, hopefully i can come back soon. I have to watch my nephew real quick
<Ryunosuke> airship iirc
<Sumica> 00,10dis song
<Kandarihu> Oh, this music!
<otakon> this isn't FF6 music is it?
<otakon> oh crap it is
<Ryunosuke> wor?
<oni_link> Be back later everyone
<Kandarihu> otakon, eeyup
<Ryunosuke> otakon yes, airship music
<otakon> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10dont know who the guy is though
<XaviortheSavior> This person bases the music played on the stage? I base it on my enemy.
<otakon> god I haven't played that game in years
<Sumica> 00,10loch I presume
<otakon> Sumica: Laguna
<Ryunosuke> sumica Uematsu ,,,
<CrimsonPeewee> ok so we got a FFVIII against a FFIV with FFVI in a field for.....
<Sumica> 00,10who?
<Barbetos> Ouch
<Dken2021> this was my favorite track form that gmae
<Barbetos> That one attack?
<OtakuTom> Yea, Caramel's currently playing as Laguna from FF8.
<Reikim|GW2> Nobuo Uematsu.
<CrimsonPeewee> what's the field in?
<Barbetos> OP much?
<Ryunosuke> the composer of the music?
<Ryunosuke> what Reikim|GW2 said
<OtakuTom> He's also got one of coolest theme songs, "The Man With The Machine Gun"
<Barbetos> The voice acting.
<otakon> eh
<CrimsonPeewee> now Gilgamesh?
<otakon> I don't like FF8 that much
<Rain> >start up psp
<CrimsonPeewee> Pretty please?
<Caramel> well, that's all for me now
<Ryunosuke> that japanese texan :p
<desertman2> woah
<otakon> I don't like the vibe of it
<Caramel> hope you enjoyed
<Rain> >apparenty I was in a battle on the first dysidia
<Rain> >die
<otakon> I don't like the enemies that level with you
<CrimsonPeewee> NO GILGAMESH?
<CrimsonPeewee> HERESY
<twilight_sprinkle> ty for le stremo Caramel
<Barbetos> Suddenly over! Thanks Caramel
<OtakuTom> Thanks for the stream, Caramel :)
<Dken2021> sure thing Caramel
<Barbetos> Anyone want to play some MvM?
<LadyCanary> Thanks Caramel!
<Sumica> 00,10cant recall who he is
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<otakon> Caramel: thanks for the stream man, it was enjoyable! good luck with SRW Z2
<Kandarihu> Caramel, thanks for streaming.
<otakon> Sumica: WHO is?
<LunerRepublicGuard> thanks Caramel
<PillowPoni> Thanks for the stream, Caramel
<Sumica> 00,10the guy Caramel was useing
<otakon> Sumica: LAGUNA LOIRE
<Caramel> Laguna
<CCCP_> Ty Caramel
<Reikim|GW2> Sumica: Laguna from FF8.
<otakon> Sumica: I said it twice now
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPeewee: True....Discord does it for the sake of ''creating chaos'', his own term of fun. Slade is more serious and calculative, but i'm saying the lack of emotion -or should i say, compassion- towards their victims is what make them similar. Still, i guess you remember what Slade did to Terra in ''Aftershock part II''
<CrimsonPeewee> Caramel I'm going to dip apples on you and lick every inch of that apple slowly to see you suffer in agony as I then slowly bit the apple little by little.
<RainbowDash90> RRRRAAAWWWEEEERRR!!!!!!!!!!!
<Derpy_Hooves> dem walls
<thelonepony> thanks for the stream Caramel
<Sumica> 00,10yeah and I said I dont recall who he is twice now otakon

<RainbowDash90> hai
<RainbowDash90> ^&^
<Dken2021> hai RainbowDash90
<otakon> Sumica: another protagionist from the okay FF8
<Barbetos> Minor character. Move along.
<LunerRepublicGuard> ello rainbowdash90
<otakon> not really minor
<Dark92Enigma> Hi AJIsAwesome|Homework!
<OtakuTom> I wouldn't really call him a minor character...
<CrimsonPeewee> cause licking an apple is inapropriate?
<otakon> but you don't know what the hell his deal is until way later
<Dken2021> CrimsonPeewee uh wha?
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Dark92Enigma: Hi! :)
<CrimsonPeewee> a Caramel coated apple?
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: well dipping it in caramel(the one here) is i think
*PlayStation3 gets turned on.
<otakon> stop that
<CrimsonPeewee> it was a pun
<CrimsonPeewee> sheesh
<otakon> it was a bad pun

<Dovah> Rick.
<otakon> Vibroblade
<otakon> sucks
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, DJ_POn-3 they all are horrible because it lacks of everything that make arts good, they're lazy copy pasting, uncreative, shows the lack of talent you have and even then the face are just doodles. You could waste your time on something more productive and talent developping instead of copy pasting face to describe some minor event that no one cares about.
<Ryunosuke> I meant this? http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Wing_Gundam_Zero
<cachi01|phone> twilight_sprinkler http://img5.joyreactor.com/pics/post/auto-comics-rage-comics-trollface-268595.jpeg
<LadyCanary> Lockon be pissed.
<CrimsonPeewee> It's the purest insult to the creative domain
<otakon> so much for their "ace"
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: assuming its meant to be art?..
<Sumica> 00,10no lockon yet
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: the hell was that?
<DJ_POn-3> CrimsonPeeWee: i understand
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, it's a waste of time
<LadyCanary> Ah.
<LadyCanary> Right.
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee........ I cant see ur point sorry lol
<CrimsonPeewee> and they ain't even funny in the slightest
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: the fact that its so easy to do and accessible makes it great, everyone can make a comic easily, and if the jokes good then the drawing supports the humor
<CrimsonPeewee> you could DRAW those face YOURSELF
<Dken2021> yea, with CrimsonPeewee here, don't really like rage comics as much these days
<Kandarihu> Originally, the whole concept of Mobile Suits were designed with a massive internal minopsky reactor to get around the square-cube law that renders giant robots virtually impossible in real life. Flash forward to nowadays, and we have a Mobile Suit that's powered by solar energy. My suspension of disbelief is only possible by the Enact proving to be useless in combat.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: I'm not standing up for rage comics (I'm neutral about them anyways), but you do know there are inspirational rage comics, right?
<cachi01|phone> i cant
<shibaru> I told him more about the chest pain
<Buytoast> did i just see a LE EPIK RAGE FAEC comic linked?
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: dude its not art, its a joke
<Buytoast> good god
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee i cant
<cachi01|phone> Buytoast yep
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, YOU CAN MAKE THE FACES YOURSELF
<Buytoast> that's horrible
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: THATS THE POINT
<otakon> Kandarihu: GIANT FUCKING ROBOTS...that is all
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, no need to be detailed
<Buytoast> that's like crapping in a pool and making the children swim next to it
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: its.not.art. its a joke
<otakon> hell actually giant *fucking* robots is kind of scary
<CrimsonPeewee> the fact that it's accessible makes the thing lazy
<CrimsonPeewee> and degrade the human race
<Cades> does he know about ur heart fetish?
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: its like complaining about a car that doesnt have a refrigirator
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: WHAT is? what are you talking about?
<LadyCanary> Oh god.
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee dude........ U mad?
<CrimsonPeewee> you draw those face and develop your drawing
<shibaru> Yea
<twilight_sprinkle> lol cachi01|phone
<Spitfire> which gundam is this?
<Sumica> 00,10LadyCanary likes the emo guy eh?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: hes saying why ragecomics suck
<LadyCanary> LOL Sumica XD
<otakon> oh
<thelonepony> Spitfire Gundam 00
<CrimsonPeewee> or you copy paste and leave your lack of talent at that
<shibaru> And I know all about his fetish, heh heh heh
<otakon> Sumica: she likes the pretty boys
<CrimsonPeewee> and the jokes are horrible even
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: yeah the comic looks better with the pic, you said it a bit wrong too :P
<Dark92Enigma> I personally like memes, as long as they're smart, catchy and memorable
<Lyra`> Lyra likes Mr.teal suit <3
<LadyCanary> Actually, best friend does Sumi.
<Cades> whats his fetish? :P
<CrimsonPeewee> oh yeah and the l"e"?
<Sumica> 00,10ahhh
<shibaru> pee
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Ryunosuke> I have to ask
<CrimsonPeewee> IT'S A FUCKING DISGRACE TO THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
<Cades> haha cool
<Dark92Enigma> It needs to be about 20% cooler
<Dken2021> rage comics aren't that funny to me anymore, maybe if I was around 16, maybe, but now, they seem effortless mostl
<Ryunosuke> Zero Gravity and skirts....
<Sumica> 00,10I like how they show the 0g in this
<JESmith> Hey it's Chun Li
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: i find a lot of the jokes to be good. as for the drawings, the point is for them to be accessible to everyone, and the art often supports the joke
<CrimsonPeewee> when I type something in french someone will see the le and think
<cachi01|phone> twilight_sprinkle yeah i dont know how to explain things with mah words lol well atleast in english
<CrimsonPeewee> LOL RAGE COMICS
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee LOL RAGE COMICS
<Kandarihu> otakon, that excuse might almost work for a Super Robot series. This is a Real Robot series.
<shibaru> I tell him every time I pee xD
<Dken2021> what's the point of le anyway? to be edgy?
<LadyCanary> ^
<LadyCanary> "edgy"
<Cades> XD
<otakon> Dken2021: no idea
<LadyCanary> :D HARO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<otakon> I just do it bc I think it's funny
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: for to be silly
<Sumica> 00,10le sigh
<cachi01|phone> Dken2021 to be fancy??? Idk lol
<CrimsonPeewee> ....
<otakon> Kandarihu: they're still giant goddamn robots
<otakon> they need to make a proper Steel Battalion Game dammit
<LadyCanary> Haro Haro Haro <3
<twilight_sprinkle> le sets the light mood and silliness
<otakon> not that goddamn worthless kinect crap
<CrimsonPeewee> You can just make a simple face drawing as well
<twilight_sprinkle> kinect is best console ever
<CrimsonPeewee> I remember back when rage comics where only in 4chan
<cachi01|phone> CrimsonPeewee honestly i cant....
<CrimsonPeewee> you know what they did?
<Dken2021> well, don't mind the people liking rage comic, as for me, no thanks
<otakon> Sumica: is this the first ep?
<CrimsonPeewee> THEY MADE THEIR OWN DRAWING
<Sumica> 00,10yes
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Kinect is a failure and always will be unless they do some major repairs to it.
<Cades> thats probably pretty annoying haha
<shibaru> Hehe
<Athgaar> gratuitous english words
<Athgaar> seconda phasu
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If I wanted motion controls I would use the Wii
<Buytoast> LE TROLLING RAUNDOM RAGE COMIC XDXD
<cachi01|phone> Kinect < ps move < wii
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I honestly liked the idea of Kinect, but the way it performs is terrible and I wish they invested more time in it.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Homework: it wouldn't be so bad if they didn't use shit parts and try to put it in every goddamn fucking game that's coming out for the sake of coming out
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> otakon: True.
<CrimsonPeewee> at least someone is with me here
<shibaru> One time he told me he couldn't sleep cuz his heart was goin fast and I was just all like ASDFGHJKL @///@ MY HEART....
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome yeah i also thought project Natal looked awesome
<cachi01|phone> But guess what! ITS SHIT
<Dark92Enigma> My opinion on memes: They need to be about 20% cooler
<Cades> haha
<Dken2021> at least the kinect spawned some uses other than a video game addon
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: look, youre missing the point. youll never understand it if you cant get past the simple drawing part. its not art, its not meant to be amazing, its meant to be available for everyone to do and the art often supports the silliness
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Homework: take ME3 for example had squad commands with the kinect. that you could have EASILY done with the goddamn mic on a 20 buck headset but fuckt hat shit
<cachi01|phone> With kinect u can Shout fus ro dah xd
<Kandarihu> otakon, the original Gundam series was designed carefully as a deconstruction of the Super Robot series of the time. It deconstructed EVERYTHING Tomino found wrong with the genre, and he did it well enough to found a whole new subgenre.
<otakon> CrimsonPeewee: it's just meant to be funny is all, remember not everyone has the same sense of umor
<Dovah> so much words... they are not cool..
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> otakon: Agreed.
<otakon> Kandarihu: I liked it
<LadyCanary> I smell a kick?
<CrimsonPeewee> twilight_sprinkle, I get what you mean and I still say that it's horrible to mankind to resort in stuff that others already did to tell their own story
<twilight_sprinkle> must be one stinky kick
<otakon> yay! Post Mortem promontions!
<cachi01|phone> My bro while playing skyrim with kinect: FUS RO DAH FUS RO DAH work goddammit!
<Buytoast> oh hey it's ada wong
<otakon> cachi01|phone: lol
<Buytoast> why is she in gundam land
<LadyCanary> Idiot.
<otakon> oh lookie a chinese dressed chick
<Kinixys> I've never really seen any gundam at all.
<CCCP_> Anyway goodnightbeverypony
<Brad_> Loved this better than the actual fanfic... http://i.imgur.com/oR4UU.jpg
<Kandarihu> If there's one good thing that the Kinect is good for, it's homebrew Motion Capture.
<otakon> I hate the uniformal style this has
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CCCP_: NIght! :)
<otakon> bye CCCP_ sleep well take care
<CCCP_> :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kinect is getting fucking shoehorned into every game
<Dken2021> I think the problem with some memes these days is that they aren't as accidental anymore, now it's user generated and over used way too often
<cachi01|phone> Brad_ same here
<otakon> I've never been big on the whole skinny body look too much
<LadyCanary> For gods sake stop complaining and just watch the goddamn Gundams.
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPeewee: well plagiarism of jokes i another matter, a lot messier and, frankly, impossible to properly see
<CrimsonPeewee> Brad_, MLD is overrated
<Brad_> CrimsonPeewee, I agree
<otakon> LadyCanary: skinny body desings look weird to me
<Brad_> Overhyped too.
<twilight_sprinkle> true, the troll meme is often overused, here as well tbh
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> CrimsonPeewee: True, and so is Cupcakes. Cupcakes is a terriblly written fanfic.
<LadyCanary> Kyrios....
<cachi01|phone> LadyCanary there are some gundams arguing Bout the same in the background
<LadyCanary> Wait was that Allelujah's gundam?
<otakon> no idea
<otakon> I'm SO glad this series EASES YOU IN
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome no. SAM is a terribly written fanfic
<CrimsonPeewee> AJIsAwesome|Homework, indeed, it ain't the gore that makes it terrible it's really the whole writing style
<otakon> oh wait it explains NOTHING
<Sumica> 00,10it's an introduction ep otakon
<LadyCanary> ....Oh mama....I like giant guns :3
<Dken2021> ah, gundam, a series I could've got hooked to, but my younger self wasn't interested at the time, oh well
<otakon> Sumica: it introduces NOTHing
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: EXPLAIN, SERIES! EXPLAIN!!!!
