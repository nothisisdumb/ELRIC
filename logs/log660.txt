A straight to DVD movie at that

celestia is 3000 yrs old
the darling has been doubled
bow before me, peasants!
There is a little wire, in my brain, that shorts when that pony says darling. Just her. It is telling me to murder things.
that lip-sync
23
11,01We need one male alicorn in the show.
They have cars in Equestria?
i've got a really bad feeling about this
yes for more alicorns in G4 ;)
I blame you all for this
fucking girl logic hating on the Queen title

If everypony is a pincess, isn't their no ruler?
brb

...There's no stream, isn't there.
...
How?
:<
Dude wanted help with grammar.
I like hats :P
Which is the least of the problems concerning that literary abomination.
Good to know I was completely and totally justified.
I mean, how? How does an atrocity like that happen?
00,10refresh
these multi-cellular lifeform have done some intersting things
i´m out.. bye
G'night everypony! :)
...D'awwwww
k
OMFG ADORABLE
aww
I mean the grammar is atrocious but the story itself is just terribly bad.
0,14Digimon? YEEEEEEEEEEES
haha
You know the phrase "lavender mare" appeared 7 times in chapter 1?
Digimon again?
Please don't remind me please don't remind me
daaaaaw.
I was going to leave, but then i realized digimon
With plot, anyway.
There's no pacing, no setup, the thinnest of connections, it's just...urgh.
but yeah, I'll be back later
Oh hey look it's that other show I never got to watch as a child!
I told him that sorting the grammar out was something to do after everything else is fixed.
Well that's one way to look at it.
The way I saw it was basically "fix his grammar, let the EQD prereaders tear him apart"
00,10magnets
Lies.
digimon!
0,14yep
Combination of the above.
xD
;______________________________________________;
I'm back, and-Digimon?!
00,10dari is a time lord
11,01I should stream Bastion.
13my little syndication, RSS is magic
They have a sun in Digimon world?
0,14man, mods are popping up everywhere
Pfft. Herdmind.
Train?
0,14>Digimon
0,14>pokemon ripoff
0,14....
I was under the impression they were two distinct series.
lies
0,14Digimon came out FIRST.
and BS
Are you really?
0,14...I shouldn't be, but I am.
0,14like...'96?
0,14To wikipedia!
i believe digimon was 95-96
*manner
00,10Digimon also has games
I'm getting a lot of buffering.
00,10a hand held that never got US marketing
The other advice I gave was "go read something that isn't crap"
To be fair, though (on the grammatical end at least) I'm pretty sure English isn't his first language.
No excuse on the plot level, though.
digimon
0,14yeah, those wondersawn games explain Ryo's presence in Adventure 02 and Tamers
It's not. Which frankly ownly confuses me further.
adventure 02 was AWESOME!
Apparently in later chapters he turns it into a comedy, or something. I don't know, I couldn't get past the first chapter.
0,14^
they learn without fighting
...
You made a grammar mistake.
0,14I actually plan on naming my first born son Davis
This is testamony to the sheer badness of this.
0,14eh, got too lazy
0,14Digimon to watch :3
But entertainment is fuuuun~
Gabumon's pelt = Edd's Hat
0,14...dat smooth jazz
I MUST TAKE ON THIS QUEST MYSELF THEN
is somnthing streaming
besides my logic is thesis worthy :3
0,14Nope.
I managed to read chapter 2.
HOORAY
0,14I liked Gangnam Style, but not that much =P
But by the end of it I was getting a headache.
lol
Well, you have a stronger tolerance for BS than I do.
but for now theyre cute :3
oof, look at that blush <3
On the subject of English not being his first language, though...I can actually understand that.
obv
People publish things to get attention. In all fandoms - and especially this one - English is generally the language of choice.
0,14...Shipping reasons and that's all I'll say.
00,10ahhhh
It's stupid but there's logic behind it.
oooof
0,14For Digimon, I am a UPS worker.
i read sooo many ship fics for digimon <3
00,10you wanted tai to get the girl
AND THEN
AHAHA
sorry i eman
hot damn you're stupid
TAKE THAT
uh oh

I want to find my old digimon games now...I know I still have 3 for ps1 - I hated that loading screen
Okay. I just refreshed on the first eyecatch and didn't find myself moving too much ahead. We're all lagged like this, we gotta be
Well that's even more discouraging.
how embarrasing
Seadramon evolved from Horseamon
lol
You're in despair.
This fanfic has put me in despair.
Power lines.....

OH FUCK THERE REALLY IS A STREAM
0,14though I haven't really seen the originals

Am I getting it right?

"You cannot write fiction"
group walks in and laughs from off screen
More or less.
tentacle rape?
Actually, if I wanted to be really blunt...yeah, that would work.
lol
*head desk* &&&
same thing?
"Just...go live in a cave and never attempt to communicate anything through the written word"
That monster looks ridiculous!
"You have zero talent with the English language. Please stop now before I am forced to trepan myself out of self-defense."

0,14Ehhhh
There aren't enough bandits to kill in Skyrim
The idea has merits.
poorly rated movies arn't always bad. critics are not always known for their taste
yeah! :)
i liked the a/b method
after all. Kung Pow is a A+ movie, and they gave it a 'bad' rating
Is that going by IMDB?
sunshine sunshine *punch punch*
The song is oodly fitting
0,14I'd be against it
GabeMoistmonL That'd be A
BOOKS
7.5 on Rotten Tomatoes, I'm guessing?
i'd rather stick with the old system too
books!!!
rotten tomatoes suck..
00,10I would rathr go by IMDB
00,10if we even do that
Well it'd definitely cut time down and it's worth seeing how it goes.
how can we read if she owns all of them?
For some reason I had that grand chorus pop into my head at school last week.
FUCK YEAH BOOKS
Dat Book
next is socks I bet

2,14 TheMaster...the current system would already have it as A...
I think I want to read now. Don't know why...
Aladin Ponies?
:D
:D
/me Rings a bell
lol
since it got a 5.3
Fuck that movie.
That movie was awful!
hm. maybe the 7.5 cut off system wouldn't be terrible in that case
2,14 I voted no on the WMC for that
2,14 it's not WMC material, at all
hello
It's the community codec pack!
oh dear
It shouldn't be WMCed for the same reason Spider's Web isn't WMC
I should've been there
i approve of the change now
I didn't realize how appropriate and well fitting this song is to Ponies...
With films that are just REALLY bad, we all at least get a kick out of hating on it together.
Yeah but I've been picking NeverEnding Story as A and its 7.4
I dont think there's anything that cant be ponified
00,10yeah it was hard to even riff babes
2,14 people are mistaking "bad" movies with "no on is enjoying this"
lol
RARIQUEST
2,14 you can enjoy a bad movie
what's up?
RARIQUEST!
:D
you couldn't mst3k it?
2,14 no one enjoyed Babes
RarityQuest?
how is such a thing possible? no movie can't be riffed
Has anyone seen Miracle Dogs Too
other than "those" two?
I missed Babes in Toyland - I think I came here a month later - how bad was it :D

Whats the most overrated movie ever?

Close?
Unless someone feels evil and decides on a WMC bore-a-thon....
No tooting here. This is Rarity Quest
D-Wars had an old woman walk into a fence and fall down.
Worth it just for that.
D-Wars would have been unwatchable without Rifftrax.
as a threat for a ungrateful and evil populace

Do you guys listen to Replacer? he made awesome ponies musics
00,02WITH A SEGFAULT
Oh boy
00,02windows nt is a microkernel
You're Replacer?
although I only reall enjoy that song at the piano kicks in
maybe......maybe its a magic segfault?
Java, whaa, no I just I said yes to enjoying his music
or just winblows trolololol
heheh
Because I stumble upon Mt Poniator once here.
in Rarity channel
he pops in alot but i never see him say much
00,02d3rb, its just stupid, they cripple the os's performance for reliability reasons then cripple reliability for performance reasons
Yeah, I suggest about a good scene for his animation and suddenly he replied!
come on, I know at least ONE of you has dreamed of dating a pony
Nah.
rei ayanami pony?
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Eva pony huh.
Hmm, emotionless pony...
Java: He's actually on most nights, as far as I've seen. Not the most talkative, though.
Glad to know.
Thanks for the info.
He's been AFK for > a day though

Where do I vote?
There's a vote?
I thought it was a lottery
Sign up for the newsletter
Newsletter?
You're sort of voting for a movie in a way
Sort of, but not really
Asking them nicely works too.
I mean, that's a hilarious movie.
You have to sign up for the Newsletter to enter the lottery
The lottery is how they pick the movies and episodes every week.
Sorry guys need to afk for a while.
For me I'll just continue voting for Forrest Gump every week :$
I don't enter very often, but when I do I always put in Castle of Cagliostro. :>

00,02AdamTheDuck, didnt get it hot enough
Didn't "Is It A Good Idea to Microwave This" do that?
I'm pretty sure they did
00,02didnt actually microwave it
00,02its a microwave oven
00,02i ovened it
Isn't a microwave oven a microwave?
May we ask for the purpose of this experiment? :D
I thought that was the same thing...
00,02Gold_Demona, convection oven
00,02microwave ovens heat via 2.4ghz radio
00,02the one i was using is combined microwave/convection
00,02i used the convection bit
Heh
00,02actually microwaving it is pointless and stupid
Never heard of that. That's interesting
I've seen an XBox being microwaved. It's... interesting.
00,02Gold_Demona, lots of prety lights i imagine
I think the XBox was one of their earlier ones
Like right after their college dorm room seasons.
^
The only good thing they have is Cave shooters :D
Thanks
It's a good place i'm gonna eat at
I expect we've got an answer.

Technically, I suppose that'd be the bog-standard Egg Pawn.
for standard assault, here's an ultramarine http://derpy.me/Ji-JQ
and those guys are pussies
Oh, you swapped to a different franchise?
No, an Egg Pawn could probably be taken down by that.

yea, in the waist cock pit
00,02Vordox, you there?
Possible, if unfeasible, unless we're going by the 'solar dictator celestia' fan-interpretation.
to bad games like these fall under the Radar nowerdays :( at least Ubisoft is kind enough to still pour a lot of money into this
00,02this might take a while
dats a BIGASS Chainsaw
00,02and not at all on 2d
Battlefield 3 praised*
00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, thats always been anoying
00,02but the increase in gpu power has allowed games that could not have been made possible
No it wasn't. The weapon system was an impenetrable mess, the crystarium was a rehashed sphere grid, the characters were completely unlikeable, the music was uninspired, the battle system had several glaring flaws... but at least it looked pretty.
I've always taken more interest in the ideas and psychology behind some games.
I suppose we're done here and moved on?
I've no idea, I'm just trying to keep up.
00,02something like rage is really interesting
Why?
BECAUSE IT ENDS ON A TO BE CONTINUED SCREEN.
:<
00,02AdamTheDuck, 'megatextures' in practice meens MASSIVE environments are possible
Yes. It's been out for a while now.
And literally, I am not kidding.
00,02AdamTheDuck, look at any rage screenshot, theres no terrain in the skybox, its all rendered
Well f*ck right off then Square.
00,02XD
00,02JunkerKun, the earlier versions used 'virtual textures' or something like that, same tech on a different scale
00,02JunkerKun, id tech 5 was built around the idea, in theory it allows clean scaling of graphical quality to many different types of hardware
00,02the intent is to remove the burden of worring about hardware from artists
(They were entirely too proud of having somewhat mediocre voice actors, primarily :P)
anyone played XI? how was it?
After a while I wanted to strangle Tidus. "Live and let l-" *shot*
00,02i've got ff 10 for the ps2, havent managed to play it for various reasons
00,02JunkerKun, yeah, engine needs work, but its a step in the right direction
00,02away from 'OMG PRETY GUNS' and toward enabling artists to do amazing things
Heh. Dungeon Keeper II outdid 'em there. They put the sequel hook in the main menu. "DK3 trailer". Not kidding. :P

Also there's three episode of the show in it
and the artbook is like quite filled up
since it tells you some info about everygame
also six games
HUD in 64 doesn't update well

quite good
I honestly didn't like many of the arrangments in Brawl
I hope I won't chatch cold, because there isn't good weather outside
but thats orignially from melee isnt it?
Best level
Thats why more people get sick in the winter, they don't go outdoors as much due to the weather.
hi
i'm (momentarily) back!
but yeah if you play with the wii remote alone
well, I go out sometimes, but only sometimes :D
it FEELS like Kirby
there isn't much to do
Youl probably be fine
