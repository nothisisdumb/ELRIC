Oh
03that's what I'm saying
03but some newer versions of it do have activation
03not sure when exactly Microsoft added it in, but it doesn't surprise me
I have become ye' ole janitor at the local Walmart
XD
03since Windows XP was the first big MS software to have it, and that was 2002...
Impressive, chamberlain.
Which gave out a "student" version on an Enterprise class disc... with a teeny bit of modifying the image... well I have full Enterprise class Office 2K3 that needs no activiation and is fully functionally legit... sort of. :P
Haha
03XD
03well I have the Office 2003 "all in one" ISO
03it's on my server, actually
03free to download
03built-in serial
03that's OBVIOUSLY pirated, but LOL
Nice.
03still installs the same way
03Our school doesn't give out software, but they give us free access to MSDNAA
03which is more or less the same thing LOL
03just no Office
03they have the Office *addons*, not the actual program
03but they'll sell Office 2007 Enterprise for $50
03but again, EW
03I have it installed just because some of my retarded professors insist on using the new format, but other than that I absolutely refuse to use it
wb comrade
The only software I *had* to buy... was Maple...
Which sucks.
03LOL
i am welcom
03I coulda pirated that for yuou'
03*you
Eh, at least it's convienent for those idiotic assignments that need Maple work... plus it was really cheap.
($2.00)
03LOL
03Dude
03can you get me a copy for $2?
(Yay for cashiers who don't read numbers right. :P )
03oh.
03I can *pirate* it, but legit software for really cheap is nice XD
(It is supposed to be $20.00 :P )
03ah
03that's still not that bad o.o
03actually
03lemme look how much mine has it for
wb
hey
piece of [censored] computer
:(
03also
What happened?
03Buy a Mac, get an iPod touch free! * <-- EW
03"Buy a crappy computer and get a crappy mp3 player free"
03that's just stupid
microphone is physically broken
:(
:/
03o.o
03my college doesn't sell Maple
piece of [censored] computer
03which is weird, because they use it in calculus classes...
I agree
I trolled the Canadian released iPads in FutureShop today. Hehe.
I'm guessing you were just downloading a driver
03nice
03I trolled the Apple store\
my dad gave me an ancient old microphone
03changed all their homepages
03to Zune.net or DroidDoes.com
Oh
03or another site that basically just called Apple users morons
03which is true
Hm
and yeah, I tried reinstalling the driver
(One I ended up getting a large Win7 loading screen on it's screen in just such a way it actually looks like it's booting Win7. :P )
[censored] computer
(The other is on a flash heavy site which is covered with "You don't have flash installed." :P )
Yeah
[censored] thing
[censored] Things
.........
Does the new(or old I guess) one work?
yeah
it just looks like it came from the 80s
Hahaha
is it huge?
yeah
and plastic
Also, the only Apple Store I know of... was trolled much better then I ever could troll it. :P
I broke it already
Is it one of those white ones?
thought it would bend
Oh no
lolz
(Let's say... combine a seminarian mac hater... bored CS people... and access to liturgical dress and holy water. :P )
03XD
*snap*.... oh noez
So the microphone component of the hardware is busted
yes
not much I can do about that
Nah, I guess not
I wonder how that happened?
this ancient one still works though
Okay, we could use that one then
the plastic just snapped
Heh, the neighbour is complaining hehe.
How to be intelligent: When the HAM operator (not me) tells you to "Get the <expletive> off my router." It's a good idea to listen. :P
if you had an xbox and a mic then you could have connected it to your laptop and use it
03either that or start downloading viruses?
/me hides
Well, the neighbour is unhappy becuase of the fact he's trying to connect and the massively amped HAM router is interfering with his connection.
03heh
03still, it's fun to steal neighbor's Wi-Fi and download pirated stuff on it
/me runs
(Which the HAM is allowed to do. Because he has a liscense he paid for, not the nooby neighbour.)
Except doing that over HSMM can get the HAM in /deep/ trouble.
Heck going to a webpage with a pop-up add or banner ads can get a HAM in extremely deep trouble.
12hai~
(Also, the vast majority of the useful internet is behind SSL and other protocols involving crypto... meaning inaccessible unless you want legal issues.)

I somehow took away the "root" from that
Some of the questions were kind of dumb

12you talking to me or lyon?
04SHH
07both
12or are you talking to yourself D:
04Don't make him notice me
12lyon later want to do me a favor?
04eh?
04depends on the favour
12it would involve you getting on the pokemon online server
12i want to see if i can hack the program to play different music XD
04lolk
04later though
12there kyu
12i posted XD
12is it just me or is the forums very laggy
07blah
07you wad D:
12that's why i didn't post
12a great warrior chooses his battles
12oww
Like that.
/me RUNS
07more like a lazy poster doesn't want to participate D:
lol
12i do want to participate
!staff Kyu
!deshou Kyu
/me throws a Shaymin at Kyu, deshou
12trust me i do, but the condition of the rp just makes it hard right now
07and that condition would be....what?
12needs more action and less talk D:
ACTION
There you go.
12some sort of action that doesn't involve a fire monster that would just brush glacy aside like he was nothing lol
07which makes me question the logic of you skipping the only major battle that will happen for a long time
07plus
07they didn't even know they were heading into a battle when they left the cave
12where is everyone right now?
03dead.
03I killed them all.
12as much as i could read they are still away from the village overlooking the village
07no
07they couldn't see the village from the cave
12but they can see the smoke
12from over the mountain
07when they got close
12sigh
07they're nowhere near the cave anymore
12glacy is still by the cave
12-.-
12that makes things just dandy
12now what am i supposed to do
07which is why I poked you to post back when they just left the cave, but you were complaining about your teeth
12hey surgery is painful D:
12and so are toothache
12you try to roleplay when you want to just.... knock yourself into a coma for the next couple of weeks
12sigh
12i honestly don't know what to do
12i'm so out of the loop
07it's not impossible to string together half a paragraph when you just had teeth pulled
12for me it apparently is
07considering I had essays to do in school when I had my 4 taken out
12people are different
12some can multitask, some have difficulty doing just one thing
07and you'd be more in the loop if you had him participate and actually say words
12i can't agree more
07then do it o3o
12what about now?
07edit your post to say he went with them
12give me a couple
12to reread everything
12i don't even know who Tomai is
o...k?
12there needs to be like a list of the villians
07well that's what the archives are for
07but i didn't add him in yet
07he is in the signup thread though
12all those pages x-x
07well just ask questions instead of trying to figure everything out
07that's what everyone else does
12who is Tomai then
07mercenary who was hired to hinder their progress to the capital without actually killing them
12ok
12i still don't follow where everyone is
07there's about 10 miles between the cave and the town, and there's a bunch of mountains in the way
12ok
07the group is about a mile from town
07so they can see it now
12gotit
12sigh i should of known this would be a challenge for me
/me stares at Lyon
/me stares at a tree
/me stares back
04I'm doing HW
07post o3o
12the truth is is that i'm a really incompetent reader

5"There's coffee in that nebula!"
12Godot
12is a super coffee lover
5Ah, from Phoenix Wright. xD

/me blinks
Nothing
I'm just p***ed.
about what?
Just a lot of small things stacking
ahh
i know how that feels
i see
Hey Vulcan.
i didn't know you were a senior
/me thought you were like 15 o.o
There's also the fact that whenever I've tried talking about my graduation or something about my personal life, I get completely ignored. .-.
freaking unresponsive internet lol
14Heya. :3
12Yeh whats the prob..?
D:
i'm not ignoreing you Kipi
[censored] the internet
He's being a baby.
for some reason it kept freezing when I tried to view a video
about what?
How are you?
my guess..everything?
He starts crying randomly, and whn I try to poke him to find out what's wrong, he refuses to talk and crawls into a corner of self-misery
14Good, you?
..... wow
he should see drf's mom, maybe she can help him work things out... being that she's a therapist... i mean
03LOL
03my mom would probably make him more insale
/me runs
03*insane
XD
drf would be happy to lose one part of his insanity though
/me shot
Yeah, and I'm like... okay, what exactly do you want? If you don't want help, why bring it up. If you do want help, then SAY something
I'm fine at the moment.
14Ah.
exactly, he should say something then
I think he's upset that he's dropping out, but it was his choice. -.-
12Attention seeking due to sadness/depression etc.
yes
12Best thing to do is actually to tell him you're there for him if he ever comes to you about it
12and then leave him to it
12That usually snaps someone out of their senses
12If they need you that badly, they'll go to you
I guess
03I'm gonna reboot in a bit...
kk, see ya drf
omg my mep already has almost 400 views thats insane for only 1 day ahahah
03waiting for this movie to save
03I finally figured it out though
03how to make it record and not be copy-protected
03the thing is I have to start and stop it manually x.x, if I just schedule it it WILL be protected
sweet
03I just need to figure out why LOL
03because I'm lazy
03and it's so much easier to just tell it when to record stuff
/me flops
03XD
03that's a reference to the show
/me munches drf's facial region
I know

12besides darkrai
12lolz
12as far as I know: no o3o
10Zekrom might be Dark
12i have a feeling they are going to be part bug or something
12XD
10Bug type legendaries won't work
12lolz
12WHY is Bug good against Psychic? v.v;
12got to admit it hasn't been done yet though
/me 12will NOT lose to a Caterpie >:|
/me 12hides
12do you really want to read the mind of a bug?
12no, but I don't want to lose to one due to lack of that more o3o;;;
12*that, more so
/me shakes off the thought of Caterpie as a legendary
12i'm all of a sudden reminded of the orange islands
12lol
/me has the Johto Legue Champions song stuck in her head and if singing it o.o
is it sad that i know all the lyrics?
12lolz
10It's not something to be sad about
10Rather, you should feel proud of yourself

and i mis read that as fiends for some odd reason
2?
Haha, torrents.
/me shoots brother
Yay, warez. ;)
>:3
Huh?
since I'm stuck on Fallout 1 and dont want to play it right now
And...What's that?
the original HOI2 is boring
if you know what ashes name is say me
Ww2 strategy but more..advanced
from 39
up to 64
or 53
either way
So it's a PC game?
yes
Brother: Where are you stuck in FO1?
04I posted
2Yes, Lyon?
I can't download torrents for other console games
2oh
2yay
Mother Deathclaw
02http://i46.tinypic.com/qqxr0j.jpg <--Like that?
04REDEYE
Brother: Oh, that... fun.
04and yes
04he looks much more fierce
I bascially spent ALL my money on a plasma rifle
Brother: So you want the torrent for that game?
02Hmmm...should I make his teeth red...?
02And thanks Lyon
04np
So what problems are you having with it?
02NS called him cute last night and I was furious
but the more exact problem is where to place is to activate it
04lol
04Shiny, PM?
02Sure, go ahead
it took me..what 30 minutes to find the F1 file?
since the program files decided to spilt into 3
2yeah, Shiny
2:D that looks a LOT better
awsome red eye
looks like Sauron's for some reason XD
2btw: contrasted shading is very dramatic
12Lyon
12mind explaining your last post to me
2just a small useless note XD
12XD
04Well
Combat Shotgun :D
Burst is the best mode for the game, I couldnt beat harry without it
12ok
12that sounds much better
12thx
Brother: I much more prefer using a minigun. :P
I am too weak for the minigun
because I want the master to kill himself
/me 2is poked
2yes, Shiny?
02Your turn, PM?
2sure O:
Brother: You know... you don't even need to confront The Master at all right?
a waste filled moat is fun to see
I know
but seeing an insanes persons mad filled dreams got to dust if he succeded
And why don't you get the strength and other "upgrades" from the BOS?
and if he saw he would ultimately kill all life as we know it it rather amusing
well there is a thing for that
even though I have 5 years to do all the things
I dont have Rad X
and probablly too poor to get any
besides i want to liberate the town from the regulators
So then... you've not run down to The Glow yet?
(ironic their name in fallout 3 xD)
No
in my first run I did
I actualy thought it was where a nuclear bomb hit
Have you actually managed to get deep into The Glow though?
No
The ZAX in it makes the end game much, much, much easier.
I'd die in 5 minutes
I know
and the extra goodies make it all the more fun
And have you exploited the "free money" glitch yet?
plus you get to *spolierspolierspoliterspoliterspolier*
No
I have expolited the steal stuff from people :p
Dead channel.
seriously, i steal stimpacks from people
and ammo
Go to one of the casions (if they're still running)... then go to a table... and hold down 1 and 4 for money... you'll make much.
though I'm still the good guy
Highlight time. :o
casions?
(Tape the keys down... go and do something and come back to a few billion. :P )
BLARG
Yes, in The Hub and Junktown.
lol
Junktown one died
since I killed the fatman
it wors sometimes
Hub...idk
I'd check that
Oh, then go to the one in The Hub, it'll be fine... and you'll make a lot.
!random
wohoo
(Advisement: Tape the keys down and go watch a long movie... like Das Boot.)

Woo

7You CAN ride a dragon.
04I know
they were the toughest enemies besides the boss
04but I want that particular dragon
7Hmm/

Brother: Application of either a minigun, or plasma rifle.
And while wearing power armor.
hmm
what about combat shotgun?
and does it matter if you have like 4-5 party members?
That's a good idea... but still get a much, much more powerful applicator of pain.
melons.
aiy!
:P
I want to go to bed!
I got the plasma rifle
no.
there is an embargo against freshblood from going into bed
though I'm not skilled in it
cause you stain the sheets
Do you have adequate armor?
Congealed_Blood can go to bed.
[censored] children wont leave me alone! Do I look like I have a pencil?!
yeah
Well I dont
Metal armor
like one that boss raider has on him
Well, good luck... but I highly advise getting power armor.
7Dracopyre on, Dracopyre off. o3o
I should
but I'd have to go to the hub first
then buy them
7O_o
/me 7warps out and --OOH.
7SINE QUA NON. :D
Brother: You can't buy Power Armor... you have to go to the BOS for it.
I know
(And to get into the BOS you need... to go to The Glow.)
I know but I mean
the hub has RAd X
aka the only way to survive the radiation
However, the nice thing about the Power Armor... is after you do the mother deathclaw thing... make sure you get the "scientific texts" or whatever are in the sweres... and you can get your Power Armor made even more of a gamebreaker. :P
ummm..then go to bed
you non pencil person :(
I know
once you helped the guy from the...what is the citys name callwd?
oh well, he helps you make better powerarmor
though it is still very...vunderable to deathclaws
thats what makes deathclaws so awsome
I can now go to bed!
I'd bug dari and say "night x" but I think he's gone to bed too lol
Hah.
lol
oh
night dari x :D
Cya. :P
lol

03you don't happen to know any music programs that can analyze a song and find others with the same tempo, do you?
03and o.o
03Du Hast isn't satanic, is it?
"March march dabrowski!"
03it's just "you hate me" over and over XD
with ASD, you can set any tempo to any song
/me rusn
03LOL
03but I want ones that legitimately work
03the problem is
03I can find a "BPM', but it's always wrong x.x
my mum lieks MJ, and i tried slowing down billy jean to match "stranger on moscow"
03Du Hast is like the perfect tempo to walk to
& she didn't liek it
03my mom likes Thriller o.o
03but yeah, it's obvious when you fudge tempos like that
mb you could batch analyze tempos in Traktor and sort the library by BPM?
03hm
03well all the programs I've found that give a BPM aren't that accurate
03given that most songs change tempo at one point anyway
06pfttthththth
03the guitar part in Du Hast is what I'm referring to XD
06Here I am babysitting, while people are partying it up at Fanime
Traktor is a professional DJ program
bbl I need to reboot
03yeah but too lazy to go pirate it
& i think there's a free bPM analyzer by the dudes that make Mixmeister Fusion, altho imo it might be more inaccurate
03hm
06craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap

"You'll pay for this captin planet!"
...RUGRATS <3
06rugrats lol
06love that show
06although
06Dil killed it
the show was epic though its current
is horrible
06and then Kimi just slaughtered it
meh dil was somewhat a killer
06Dil was tolerable I guess
06but Kimi....no
hey anorld was when nick died
it lost most originality by that point
show was boring, slow paced
06uuuuuuuuuugh nooooo
06Hey Arnold was one of my favorites
it was
06rocket power too
Rocket power was epic
06wooogitywoogitywoogity
as was te Wild Thornberries
06I still do that with my friends
06ahahahha magic schoolbus
animaniacs was the best moment of my childhood
03LOL wut
so jumpu and exiciting XD
06ew I hated animaniacs
03anyway bb l
D:
how could you
06I hated most of the WB shows
06except pokemon was aired on it
06which was ok
tiny toons <3
06....
that was a classic
06hated those too
you hate the tiny toons?
06Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote
06that was awesome
06I'm one of those people who hated pinky and the brain too
it was almost as good if not more
/me blows up the mouse
D:
how could you hate pinky and the brain?
it had the best theme XD
06I don't deny the theme
06and yes I do
06hate that show
06I used to like it
06but then I realized just HOW MUCH I HATE THAT MOUSE
if you saw the movie and hated it I dont blame you
06didn't even care to see the movie
if you hate the ghoust busters cartoons, you are cruel
06never saw em
for one..they talked
and they never chased each other

12 Hello, lol and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Hmm, it's nice, but why not just embed mibbit?
06I've been listening to that since I posted thos elyrics <3
Dunno
06I watched the show every now and then, but I LOVED that song
remember Gargolyes?
o.0
its theme was just..like the pre-immediate music
I'm hoping to expand that past what Mibbit can do
Haha, a JS IRC client is pretty cool though.
Such as? :o
mibbit is just very limited
how so?
that and I'm not very fond of the whole spyware thing
06never watched it much either
Also, I feel very uncomfortable passing a password through mibbit
arg..the 90s spider-man
wat.
I know some of the people who run mibbit, and they're not very.... professional
the only good comic related super heroes I liked from the 90s was Super man
and bat man
I got Glined on mibbit once.
what server?
For going on their main channel on their server and telling them all how crap it was.
Haha, wow
I forget, was the Justice Leauge, 90s or early 200s?
*2000s
06justice leage was awesome, but I always seemed to miss it...
i rember that the Gargolyes guy did a thing in Fallout 1 XD
who knew gargolyes could dontrol the underworld
The staff there is a joke
Alvin in the chipmunks was alright

12OMG oh yeh it does
12Damn you
/me is crushed by large pokeyman growing on him? o3o
tha black one looks a bit better, but his tail is fat
12The black one is Palkia XD
Palkia?
12It looks exactly like it but in black lol XD
reminds me of Bahamut from final fantasy
at least the suit-builder applied the correct amount of backfins :P
oh right I thought you meant it was another form
though kinda different
12http://h.imagehost.org/0641/ewfsdf.jpg

cya arti
12Seeya soon :>
omg stupid DA
I've been hearing a lot about the 3D TVs lately.
because I put my polaroid pics as snapshot it puts them in scraps >.>
oh ^_^;
anyway right now 3D TVs are not worth it.
yeah like HD, wait for it to come down
never buy a new technology at the start, it'll be astronomically expensive
that's just a premium though, give it a few months, maybe years, and they'll stop charging for something that costs nothing more to add
you know how the industry calls people buying the first version of everything? Early adaptor
also there is not that much media or software etc that's specified for 3D TVs still
Yes?
and early adaptors are perfect guinea pigs, replacing any beta-testing
No idea
How are you?
I'm alright
tired
also I heared that you'll need a blu-ray player to play 3D movies. and worse it has to be an updated or even a special player that plays 3D movies for this stuff. and you need to have an up-to-date HDMI cable.
you?
it's better to watch 3D movies at theatures.
the cables are dirt cheap and any new ones will be available soon
available with stuff
like bundled etc
speaking of which. I remember those 3D films that I watched at disney world back in the late 90s
07lol
and you need a blu-ray player simply because DVD doesn't support the dual-output required, so blu-ray is required simply to output that
ah
though you could just get a nVidia card for your computer which will give you both an awesome rig and 3D capability
available in all 3D games, too
Good.
Really good.
That's good
really good
I've noticed I really like watching reviews...
of games?
Anything...
Ah
I do too
lets me see what others think about it
Have you ever heard of Redlettermedia?
Nope
I assume they review stuff?
another thing I remember is that on nickelodian. they had a full month event with new shows that are in 3D in spacific scenes of the episode. you get 3D glasses built in food packaging like lunchables or cerial boxes.
wb Quan
The guy reviewed star wars ep 1
God I hate that movie.
however I cant remember if there was any noticable difference ^_^;;
Me too
That one was awful
Better than the animated one though
:P
has anyone seen or remember spy kids 3D game over?
I liked the old clone wars show.
Grievous actually did something.
Eh, I never cared for it
But then again, I didn't watch it much either'
so maybe I just saw the worse episodes
Maybe...
the 3D effect from that movie was a joke. especially with the cheap cardboard glasses with the sheet of plastic for the lens.
/me is dozing off a little
You bored too?
and tired
put them together and unintended naps can become a result
wb Ecco!
ty Nick!
Everytime I wake up from a nap, I feel like I'm insane, like life isn't real.
It's weird.
That is weird
Naps tend to just make me even more tired when I wake up
Me too, sometimes I may take four hour naps, wakeing up three or more times.
Yeah, I can't even do that because it's like once I'm awake I can't fall back asleep no matter how tired I feel

Two possibilities for each of the four positions
07ohaiburd
12^^
The first one is introversion/extroversion
hey arti
artiii!
Introversion meaning you recharge when you're alone or in familiar surroundings
Extroversion means you recharge when you're with friends and partying it up
/me explodes
12Yay you're still here!
12and Roara is t!
07she is t?
/me runs
Then, you have iNtuition and Sensing -- iNtuition means that you primarily take percieve the world with your sixth sense and Sensing means you percieve it with your five senses
12What the
12I meant Roara is Too LOL
06:P
/me grabs a Reshiram
Then T/F, Thinking and Feeling, which determines if you primarily think about solutions or feel about solutions
06it is FLOOF
So a T would say "I think this is right" and an F would say "I feel that this is right"
12Hey Nick
12When are you able to come visit us? :D
yeah?
Then P/J is Perceiving or Judgement -- basically, P means that you prefer your T/F attribute over your N/S attribute, and J means you prefer your N/S over your T/F
what. you mean to devon again?
Ok.
So, INTJs prefer their Intuition attribute over Thinking
Thank you for explaining.
12Nah just here
You're welcome :)
If you're curious what you are, you can take a test for it
http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
oh leeds right! You mean like before the meet?
in july?
Oh, and does anyone understand what I mean by "It tastes like the smell of"? Such as, pear drops taste like the smell of nail varnish.
Also, it's important to keep in mind that these letters are preferences -- INTJs can feel emotion, and ESFPs can have rational thought
It's interesting ready through the result at the end too
06waitwut
it's like having yourself explained
12Well yeh if you can ^^
06BMZ is Nick?
12ya
06lma
06lmao
06k
06thought it was a n00b for a minute
12XD
7this place is boring
Hahaha, yeah, same for me
7Nice job, Rora.
Because my dad just doesn't get it, I say to him that pear drops taste like the smell of nail varnish, and he says "Have you tasted nail varnish?", I just don't see how he cannot understand it.
o.o
06what?
12?
Tell him that tastes and smells are often similar -- taste depends on smell quite a bit
7Mistaking Nick for a n00b? o3o
07hah! Nick is a n00b!
/me runs
06lol well
/me turns into a Regigigas and sits on Roara

hmm
/me thinks the text at the bottom should be a light color, but otherwise, it looks great
OK, sure
/me also wonders if it would be possible to make like a whitish glow around the text
the smaller text?
The main text
I have a glow around the big text already
/me heard Altair had a massive fire at his house
Not noticable enough?
/me is just wondering how to make the text stand out
black text on dark purple can be tough to pull off without a stong glowy thing
Hmm
I could try a stronger glow
12uh oh..
blarg, stupid photoshop

so one question
is this network on home or datacenter connections?
home
all of the servers are on a home connection
Yep.
I just found it.
which is why it's semi unstable sometimes

"If any fangirls or boys come and post on my topic, there will be blood."
XD
I misread as All

lol, n2, the servers are on a pretty fast/good connection
hence the "i guess i cant complain to comcast then" :p
you seem to ping a lot lol
thats normal, trust me

i can barley connect to rizon
o_O
lol Rizon

is it the servers?
yeah
ewwwwwww, Rizon
Do I know you, n2?
when i was in NY i was able to connect to rizon without any problem
it lags quite a bit
Rizon is really laggy
"Jumping spiders are also known for their ability to read the minds of others, and use their unnatural beauty to control and monopolise humans. well maybe not the last part, but the rest is true. Edward Cullen IS a jumping spider, there's no denying it. So don't try it. Anyone else got any theories?"
depends on the server you use I think, though
all this talk about servers makes me hungry :\
now i cant get past the connection scanner
you go by another nick

Then good to meet you. ^^
Nope.
then nope, but good meeting you too :p

"Lol i had no choice i knew he wasen't a jumping spider hes a Vampire and the other one is kind of g.y so i didn't go into this thread lol i have watched Twilight with my friends its a really good movie vampires drink on blood because there cold blooded not like i would no (if you where thinking lol) so i really don't no where you got a jumping spider from bit random if you ask me"
Hahahaha
"Age: 19", I'm going to be the one that claims BS on that. There is not proof he is a vampire, there is plenty of proof that he is a jumping spider.

Actually you mean gay like that... When I say gay I know exactly what I say and that's why I say it! No reason to say hey, hey, hey, it's ok to be gay... Well it's not!. The less we accept homosexuality the less there will be and like wise it works backwards... How many *bleep*'s were there in the 80's? hardly any.

Someone told me that Stephanie Myer's (or however you spell her name) secretary or something posted a preview of her upcoming book on the internet, and she said she was so annoyed that she was going to stop writing for a bit, otherwise she might kill off the Cullen family.
why am i being picked on?
I was thinking "Damn, SO close!".
That's actually true
XD
It was just going to be Twilight from the jumping spider's point of view
Loooooooooool, that is what he shall be known as from now on.
She ended up just posting the leaked chapters on the internet

/me read it and counted 9 chagrins in 200ish pages
Lol.

I think the word that bugged me most was "smoldering".
what was it, "smouldering eyes" or something?
Yeah.
What percentage of 'chagrins' would you say were used correctly?
Most of them were
She just needs a different word
Haha yeah
Or people believed to be girls
it isn't hard either
try dismay
I wish it could actually make the jumping spider's eyes smolder, burn them, BURN THEM! (;

People believed to be girls == people whose names end with -a

this song is too addicting
2oAO DO NOT WANT
Oh yeah, have you heard about this?
http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/mar/30/stephenie-meyer-new-twilight-novella
*Chagrin*
This article was posted on my birthday
03believe about what? o.o
lol
lol
Is this what dari and you were talking about?
2er
2what they keep saying
No, that was Midnight Sun
Ah
2which I still FLATLY deny
03which is?
Stephanie Meyer is kinda scary looking
flatly?
This one's just about some character no one but the biggest Twitards would remember
2nothing much
2yes, brother
2Flatfly
2*flatly
2just like you'll be in a few moments once I find my fly swatter <3
but I'm not a fly D:
2too bad
Wait, just a character that gets killed off right after being introduced?
That's stupid
2flyswatter is my typical weapon of choice :3
Yeah
It's pointless
/me 2â„â‚¬â€¹â€ºï¬ï¬‚â€¡Â°Â·â€šâ€”Â±Â»â€™â€âˆÃ˜Ë†Â¨ÃË‡â€°Â´â€žÅ’Ã…ÃÃŽÃËÃ“Ã”
2whoops
2sorry
Smeyer's just an attention [censored]
What could the plot possibly be?
2meant to press something else
No clue
Oh waiut, plot means nothing to her
I'll probably read it for the lulz
I may too :P
It's available for free, according to that article
o3o
Well then it would be perfect for lulz
"I started writing from Bree's perspective about those final days, and what it was like to be a newborn."
A book from the perspective of a new born?
=/
balls
Newborn vampire
Like, just been bitten
ORLY
ohhhhh
o3o
/me is caught in the masterball D:
She /should have/ already written about that in Breaking Dawn from BellaSue's perspective
:D
So they consider being bitten to be "reborn"
DANG HAX >:V
I have 98 more! :D
But she didn't I assume?
But she was too speshul to have to deal with wanting to kill humans and stuff like that
Oh yeah I forgot she was speshul
/me juggles with a few just to show off
speshul enuff 2 stop teh ppl from fiting
o_O
in the 2nd 1
You'll never forget it if you read the books
How special she is even though she has no personality?
It's like Meyer was just trying to say "SHE'S AWSUM! LIKE HER!!!!"
or was that 998
whatever
Ugh
I found the story that sickened me on the news a while back
http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2010/may/10/twilight-baby-names-stephenie-meyer

He said pokeballs at a random assumption

Random variaty
" I don't call you "antitwitards" just because you are...plus Im sure it's offensive to retarded people as well."
I never said they had to be PokÃ©balls either
that would be admitting twilight is bad

"[Twilight is a hit] because Meyer knows hot to make a sex icon." Right on the money.
*how
we were just saying in my channel earlier that this network needs an anti-Twilight channel
:P
Meh, that's giving it too much attention.
and every network
XD
It was dari's idea haha
I forget what the term is, but it's making something you hate gain recognition in the very act of opposing it.
Hmmm
There's a term for that?
Reverse psychology sort of?
There's one for everything, you just need to know wehere to look.

Or you could just call it "backfiring"

It's more specific than that, but sure, for lack of.

Just found out a guy I friend requested on teh book of facez a few days ago is dead now...
Oh no
I'm really sorry to hear that
:(
It's okay, you don't have to give condolences over the Internet. :P
Don't have to
I barely knew him, but I still hate hearing stuff like that.
but it's still a nice thing to do
Yeah I know what you mean
I don't think it really makes a difference whether it's on the internet or not <.<
me neither really
I guess not. It's just that thousands die every day, and the only reason you even did was because I mentioned one.
But you're a friend and it affects you
Aw, now I can't say it anymore
Say what? :P

Just put all the heads under one blade.
oh
They have to come off simuyltaneous anyway... or is that they hydra?
*simultaneously
*the Hydra
Is Hydra the thing where when you cut off one head two more replace it?
Yeah.
But I think they all need to come off at once to prevent that and kill it.
only way to prevent a hydra's head from growing back is to burn the stub
Wouldn't it just die right away when the first head comes off?
Nope.
They grow back quickly.
They have a lot to begin with.
Cerber*s!
Oh I thought it started with one
I just remember the Disney verison
XD
When I was making an RPg I made an awesome one.
2haaaaaaa'
Making an RPG?
2Haru's Haru Haru Interview: DANGEROUS! Is hilarious XD
How did you ever make an RPG?
Yeah. A PC one.
RPGmaker2000, lol.
lol nice
I made a maze game and a version of Asteroids
Then it randomly decided I needed "harmony.dll" which ended up being a virus. *shrug*
but those are the only games I've ever made
dun dun DUN
the RPGmaker tricked you
/me runs away from the viruses
I used to write games on paper, thinking they'd maagically become games one day. xD
I once designed a Quidditch game on paper when I was about 11
Ohh, I tried to make a Spyro fangame once
I only designed the first homeworld before giving up
I pretty much had a joystick on my umbilical cord, so I was "designing" them pretty early on.
ah
A pad of paper and a pencil
:P

Epic!
Yep
goodnight guys

"I should have been a pair of ragged cla...ws scuttling across floors of silent seas..."
I saw that on your book of facez

I've been trying to figure that out. It's T.. Elliot ramblings, so I dunno...
*T.S.
Oh
Have you ever read any of Ayn Rand?
No, didn't she write on politics?
lol Ayn Rand
Kind of
more like she preached about extreme individualism
Meaning?
Putting yourself first to the point of not caring at all about anybody else and condemn anybody who isn't creative and original
It's actually somewhat inspiring until you realize how crazy she is
D:
and her views on love resemble Stephanie Meyer's
The romance story begins with rape
That terrifies me, since I've actually been thinking along those lines lately.
The individualistic stuff?
XD
Wow
Yeah.
Hahaha that sounds so horrible out of context
Yes it does
I know. :P
Oh God... D:
XD
But what I mean by that is that lately I've been seeing uncreative people as a waste of space, and I hate it.
That does sound like Ayn Rand right there

/me pours Cocoa powder into its mouth

I think that's just the most original name she could give it while making it sound absolute
I mean, sure, a person can perceive things anyway they want, but the man who dreams he is indestructible will be just as vulnerable to the semi that flattens him when he runs into the street.

Narcolepsy is fun.
I would hate to have that

randomly fall asleep
and any random time or place
including driving...
That and you stay awake at awkward hours of the night./early morning.
Sometimes you are physically unable to kepe yourself from falling asleep.
*keep
That part I get sometimes
Meh, everyone does
Yeah
But it's an effect.
speaking of sleep
I'm lacking it
I seriously think I have it in a mild form. That or an extreme insomnia that would lead me to be constantly tired.
I sometimes think I have insomnia
but I think that's just me worrying
I won't have anyone to heckle.

Or when they got bored of pondering you, you ceased to exist?

That is scary

hi Jared :3
Or that your hole universe is a storyboard in a writer's mind, and as he sees fit you act.
*whole
I've thought about that, but never for long enough to worry about it
Isn't that the plot of Inkheart? :P
Never seen it
HI Dream
My sister read the books
If that is the plot it sounds interesting
So we had to rent the movie
But more distinctly, you are able to choose, but ultimately when your arc is done you'll die.
I try not to let myself think that way
too depressing
and nihilistic
You're allowed to leave as long as the story keeps someone interested.
Oh, I don't actually believe any of this, though it's hardly nihilism if there's an actual force at play beyond what we see.
True

It is.
Which it was
yeah it looks that way

My sister kept trying to get me to read them
hai
I told her I wasn't interested
I like family films, but not that sort of thing
http://i48.tinypic.com/2yl5kzc.png (RJ made it for me)
Family films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
cute :o
No not like that
:P
...there's families in it!
I dislike that kind of movie
Though there are few that I've seen
Virtually meaningless horro flicks, really.
*horror
yeah
I enjoy horror, but not like that.
It's hard for me to enjoy any entertainment that's meaningless
should be hard with anyone with sense.
But a lot of horror is intriguing.
The fact that emotions can so easily be triggered in an artificial way like that is exciting, no pun intended.

Yeah, that's what popped into my mind.

*ones
How did I make that mistake?
*facepalms*
you had to know something was up, though, when everyone's faces are conveniently hidden until the end.
yeah
But I didn't expect them to be that creepy
They reminded me of gargoyles.
Oh yeah
they kind of did look like that
*asymmetrical
But yeah, good episode.
Did you see the
Chameleon one?
Hmmm
I don't think so
This shuttle returns from space, with some new organism in it, so the lock down the shuttle bay.
Hmm
Suddenly this scientist they know comes up against the window, banging on it and yelling for them to let him out.
Did it disguise itself as a human and...?
Yeah
I think I've seen it
They notice hd doesn't know some passphrase so they don't let him in. Yeah, yeah.
Wait, how about the really old one where the "female" computer tries to sabotage some guy's relationship because it loves him?
So relevant to the modern age
But no
xD
haven't seen that one
Yup.

I don't :D

Alright, good timing then.
Night, guys.
I'm going to a local show tomorrow to end my weekend
ending your weekend on a Monday?
then on friday I get to see GOOD OLD WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D
o3o
well duh it's a three day weekend :P
Oh duh
I forgot
hahhahah
I sure hope that's a band name by the way XD
omg though I'm so excited
of course it issss<3
Speaking of music
their new CD comes out on tuesday too <3
Have you ever heard Minstrel's Song by Cartel?
=3
ummm I do know cartel and I have one of their albums but I haven't listened to it yet lemme see if it's the on my album
Oh wait
Minstrel's Prayer
not Song
nope it's not on mine
It's from their first album I think
I heard it on a friend's CD
now I want to buy the CD
but I can't really afford music right now
torrent :P
unless we had one of those stores like you do by you
Nuh-uh
then buy it later
no torrent for me
:P
dude why hahaha
if you're gonna buy it later I don't see why not :P
I see what you mean
but it still kind of feels wrong I guess
eh the guilt leaves after a few times
and there's always the chance of viruses when it comes to doing that
well see you gotta go to the right places I always go to btjunkie and I get the ones that say "VERIFIED BY # COMMUNITY REPORTS"
:P
lol yeah
but they could just put any number
:P
no it can't...it's not in the description it's on the site piece
oh
gosh
XD
could have had a V8
oh also I think I got this signed CD today at fye it said it was brand new and it was fifteen bucks (OUCH!) but dude it's signed
somehow
o__o
Woah
That's crazy
I KNOW RIGHT :D
I even scratched at it a bit on the booklet it's def. real
I wonder if it's like a special bonus thing sent to random stores or something idk
Isn't fye a retail store too?
Hmm maybe
I don't know the difference between stores all I know is that it's a store that sells CDs :P
lol
Well they aren't used though, right?
the signed one is Bayside and I also got MGMT's older CD for 10 and The Crow soundtrack for 5 :D
fye sells used and new CDs
but it'd be marked if it was used
it was new
oh okay
my Crow Soundtrack was used though :D
I think there is a fye around here somewhere
you ever seen that movie?
Nope
Doesn't sound familiar actually
you should
What's it about?
it's one of my favorite movies and I'm not even that into horror-ish stuff
it's about a musician and his wife that get murdered in the beginning, but then he comes back from the dead for revenge, and this crow stays with him, as long as the crow is alive he can stay alive til he finishes his job
it's amazing
I think it's from the 90's I don't remember
Sounds messed up
yep 1994
lol
I love it so much it's the first horror movie I ever saw
showerbrbo3o
kay
I'm so glad I found it too it's so hard to find soundtracks for movies I like even new ones :\
like I can't find the kick ass soundtrack anywhere even
Hahaha
My friend tells me I have to see that movie
you HAVE to it's funny as hell
amazing effects too
yeah he said as soon as it comes out I have to go to his house
yessss I hope it releases fast it was so great
it had a bit of everything in it
have you seen anything recently that was good in theatres??
I wanna go see macgruber next I think
Eh, I don't think that looks very good to be honest'
and before that it was Zombieland
the next one I'm looking forward to is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
but that's not until August
that's the one with whatshisfacewhycantirememberhisname right??
michael cera that's it hahaha
Michael Cera
and yes
yay I was right
did you ever see Year One?
No
That was a great one
I was goig to but it got awful reviews so didn't bother buying a ticket
I thought the trailer looked pretty funny
eh
on all the reviews I saw it seemed to me like people thought it was going to be do[censored]entary-ish
like
people said it wasn't accurate
but that's not the point, people!!! :\
XD it isn't supposed to be
exactly
I thought it was great
and I'm not even really a movie person
I'm a movie person but not so much of a comedy person
I like crtiquing serious movies
and some comedies
bnut very few
*but
mehh I like to laugh ahha
I love older comedies
one of my other favorite movies is Eight Crazy Nights it's an adam sandler one
but the new style of comedies just doesn't do it for me
That's the animated one, right?
I've seen that
yep
hahahaha when one of my cousins used to live here we'd ALWAYS be watching that like 15 times a day
so great
My favorite Adam Sandler movies were always Happy Gilmore and Mr. Deeds
holyc rap
I never left
lolz
love happy gilmore
and now I saw Punch Drunk Love
it's on a lot but it never gets old
either way, someone beat me to the shower

04lol
The thieves guild or arena?
hmm...hard choice
both are good in rewards
but if you want to get rich fast, arena
I already am rich.
well more so rich
ghrlhgdrhdlghdr bored
/me 2kills someone to have an excuse for the blood on the floor
I do arena at the beginning to become rich
DUMB.
but thieves guild has a better reward at the end
*cough*daedraartifact*cough*
Brother. BRUDDER.
I did the real of madness first
realm*
ah
So then arena will be to easy then
:o
you already got some of the best weapons
Soooooo
:O
(shadowrend)
I'm growing a beard
:D
and the staff
XD
and other goodies
So far, so good
Actually
if you gave shadowrend up, you are cruel
I did the Aylied statue quest first
Actually had a semi-attractive girl checking me out today at the restaurant, sooooo
then you get a crown
Then Sheogorath's
hahahahah
I should've thought of this sooner
2 if you did a special trick
Then the Brotherhood
did you do the speical trick in the alyied quest?
/me has black hair, so it works
What trick?
lmfao
you see, you dont have to just follow the guy and make him have the crown
you can have 2 crowns for the price of one
*imperial city wise that is*
which you can give him it
and he dies :D
then you get both crowns
and show them off how ever you like
but yeah I advise thives guild if you want a challenge
thanks Lyon
Arena it is.
04np
it'll be too easy XD
I'll have to do it eventually anyway
And yes, I actually did do that trick.
2o3o
2wao
/me 2explodes
heh good
its more rewarding then the one crown
sometimes you can't even wear it
I don't wear either
I go... topless. :o
orly
Cuz I have nothing on the top of my head
But I don't wear a shirt either. :o
I prefer daedra headgear personally
they look so much better then anything else
But I do wear Dwarven grieves. :o
04are we talking about Morrowinf=d or Oblivion here?
04Morrowind*
04Or neither?
I have too many weapons equiped :3
But I use them all
Oblivion
Morrowind doesnt habe the realm of madness
04ah
It could, Brother.
If someone made a mod for it
though my PC file on oblivion is screwed for the moment so I can't continue my game
04I want Oblivion
its somewhat a let down if you dont have mods lyon
Morrowind is better
espically mannimarco >>
04really?
I'd agree with that
04I just think the main storyline is bettter
when you are done with the story line of Oblivion
(which has alot of these little things to get extra goodies)
like Hermanus Mora
but when thats done, console version gets boring
04well
though with the PC you get all these fun mods
04I don't have a 360
04so I would get the PC
04I already have Morrowind
then you wont get bored
04and it was really fun
but I highly advise when you get the game
04but I still didn't like Dagoth Ur as a boss
get the mod for mannimarco
you will like it
04k
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGUoRHqBgbo
thats the modded version
I hate Owyn
the un-modded...let down
they give him so much fear
04I want Bloodmoon and Tribunal for Morrowind
/me 2swats at Lyon
He thinks he can call me a moron and get away with it
2you said you would post D:
I will feast on his blood
04I will
but then? they turn him into a whiny high elf
2D: well
2do it
Kipi: but then he becomes your obident commander
so its worth it in some cases
so what do you think of the modded mannimarco lyon?
04well
041. I have no idea who he is
04but he looks pretty cool
2o3o
2so...
he's the king of worms
leader of the necromancers
04oh
2brb while I go prowl dA, now that I've done Pixiv
the first lich
a "god" in other senses
04ah
just be very prepared when you get the mod
04I really want Oblivion
if you arent like level 35 or higher
04it looks so fun
you will die
04:|
it makes him so much harder
before..well take a magic blade
any type, he goes down with 7 hits top
Well its intro is a bit..fun
STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM
prisoner escape type of thing
XD
its so funy how they do that
kipi do you remeber the pirate songs?
04lol
Yup, yup
hallo :D
"oh hey sweet lady of wayrest, oh hey sweet lady of mine, oh I'll see you again oh I'll see you again sweet lady of wayrest so fine.."
well I'm probably gonna go gnite
thats the best song
04Ohai NS
kipi should we tell him of the adoring fan? XD
He's not as annoying as most people say
thats true
LOL!!! XD!!!
wait...oh great now I have to start the whole werewolf quest again >.<
Brother, I had the Akavari Sunderblade equipped and I ran into the arena pit and just hacked away. EVERYONE dropped their weapons on the ground and now the "Den Mother" is... pantsless
<censored> power abuses
02abusers*
02bloody hell
02and hey
o.o
lol
02>>
Aww... the gray prince won't drop the one thing I want
tha quick?
04lol
04Cya NS
did you do the grey prince quest?
His shield
I just started the arena. :P
02yeah bye
XD
I mean, did you do his quest so that he doesnt fight?
it makes the fight a lot easier
Pfft, I can kill him without it...
LF Calm Natured regice
;D
but I will finish it cuz I like the stats boost
#spp-wifi
lol?
XD
this isnt purplesurge
lol
02he needs to stop using getpass on people
02passwords are meant to be private god damn it
:D
-_-
HYAHAHAHAHA!!! A fine of a mere 5200 septims? Chump change!
besides
Just Block him if you can
then you make him go into swlf pity
02he's the network admin
"oh noes I'm a vampire D:"
.
02If he does one more thing I'm removing his rights of using raw
and why did you give him that
02root
02not here
lol
02on his bloody server
wait
02I'm setting encryption right now
is he using it on me?
02think he might have once
021 sec
never joined his server, never will
that <censored>
02he used it on Reshiram
-_-
02I'm encrypting everything now
02so he can't get them
i am Reshiram
Brother, how many killable NPCs are there in the game?
ns
by any chance, would you know his ps vhost
And I mean permanent resisdents, not respawning bandits or guards
-s
or does he have one here...?
02he has an exception
o
maybe it's in a banlist somewhere
lol
02I know his vhost
021 sec
lets see..
just -e him
02Rapid.Storm.Of.Water
there should be 8-9 city guards in each city
then theres about 20-30 imperial city guards (including guards to the elder council)
k, I'll try that
he has one about a bicycle too
then we suppose there are 4-5 people in each guild hall
can't remember it
then about 15 residents in each city including the beggers
then the random followings
There was one time where I wiped out the entire towns of Bravil, Leyawin, and the Imperial city- including the dukes.
then about..6 daedra followers then times thta by 16 due to 19 lords
*16
so we got about..
:P
maybe 170 people?
That's it?
the game itself treats cyrodill as if it was a coloinal state
as if it wasnt heavy on a populance
which is ironic
it's suppose to be the heart of the empire
I was thinking more like 250+
well I' talking about how many that you can kill
without expansions of course
Oh, right
Silly me
:3
But even then
so we got about 170 people you can kill or do die
depending on wether you are a good fighter
How 'bout the settlements?
or you suck
I knew I should never had trusted him
for anything
ncluding
*have
settlements have a rareity to have 1 person or less
aka kvatch thing
/me yays
hehe
now
but the city but the 'settlement' north of it
02he used it on me before as well
kb plz
02I got pissed off
02lol
Kvatch has more than that. XP
ns
and if I dont including the necromancers spread through-out cyrodill
why waste your bandwidth
I mean the settlement up north
on a jerk
/me wants my vhost to be accepted :D
aka the 'follow dead person notes' one
he's pissed off a lot of people
I sum up about 170
about 190
*maybe
Can you look it up? owo
the game itself was too rush with people imho
I dont think so
hey RP4L we were just talking about games :P
Kipi: do you want to keep track of those you kill?
5Hey, cool. What games?
Oblivion
and how many people you can purge from it
5Huh. I have... never heard of that LOL.
I assume about 170-90 in total you could kill or do die
never heard Elder Scrolls?
04poses the question as to why she helped Ben
it had its own moment in 2007-8
5N-no.
5>>;
04she seems to have a habit of helping jerks
/me hides
well its a good series, youtube it :D
5Uh, okay.
02lol
02not on this server
/me is away: dinner, etc.
Oblivion is both original yet unoriginal in the prospect of the franchise of the Elder scrolls
04cya
original for it has nice graphics and takes into the question what is Tamerial,etc,etc
XD By the Nine, everyone has stripped down to their undergarments! I love this sword!
unoriginal for it destroys some of the concepts entirelly about the Daedra and the empire of tamerial itself
04Hey look
I've always noticed, how come the Nine barely do anything XD
04the rightful heir to the throne
yet we have sithis
04lets go save him just so he kills himself!
and the Daedra that can do partically anything
its 2:31AM here
04[/summary of Oblivion]
they used it AGAIN in Fallout 3 :|
I don't understand why ns helps people like that
04augh
04I hate recycled plots
I hate besthsa for kiling oblivion
I mean fallout
04lol
04^neither
seriously, Fallout 1 and 2
are much better than fallout 3 on all scales
even graphics
look at bloody mess in fallout 1
then in fallout 3
04what happened there?
fallout one is more..vivid
you can praticually see them being torn apart

5I looked at my post in "Legends" and then back on some of the RPs I did here YEARS ago (like back when the new TST started!) and my post looked infinitely longer. It was crazy.
5Then again, some of those posts were pret-ty short.

5I guess I'm just happy I've improved at least somewhat.

5 seconds should be enough
and that's not a "can you do it" that's a "do it out of respect for me :U"
you don't have to tell her to remove it
you just put her on ignore XD
but that's more fun and easier
and never speak to her again

/me nuzzles Espeon
/me likes this change of events

humans are too annoying to learn to draw anyway
04I CANNOT DRAW HUMANS
04but I want to draw humans
i'd start small
i'm no drawer but things always seem to be easier when you practice it piece by piece if you know what mean
04mmm

/me wags tail
/me awww's at the cute duo and takes a picture
12lol
12something tells me this DRP is going to turn really ugly fast
oo
o-o
any of you give me a network script
12not the rp
like im on 12038612308612 channels
eh?
12just the story
oh
XD
99999999999999999 op
like that
lmao
i have one i think
let me check
I'm on 20 channels, across 3 networks. I have 2 olines, 1 owners, 4 admins, 6 ops, 1 halfops, and 4 voices. I have abusive power over 57 people.
well actually
OH ok
i don't have fancy colours though because such scripts are fail :3
that prediction probably isn't TOO far off for the RP, either :P
12when i refer to the rp
can you please shares the script
:o
12i mean the people in the rp like who is posting
sure, hang on
lol
I'm on 19 channels, across 5 networks. I have 1 olines, 6 owners, 8 admins, 11 ops, 2 halfops, and 2 voices. I have abusive power over 268 people.
so
is it it's-my-turn-to-post-no-way-it's-mine, or go-post-it's-your-turn-no-you?
lulz
12true XD
12nah
12it's always aero's tern
12*turn
i really just have that script just because there's no reason not to
including the time i tested it just now I've used it 2 times
where should i put it
alias
remote
at least if you're using mIRC otherwise idfk
so
how should i test it
type /bragspam
lulz
I'm on 33 channels, across 4 networks. I have olines, 4 owners, 4 admins, 13 ops, 3 halfops, and 12 voices. I have abusive power over 143 people.
you need 1 more channel to be a cooldude
i have olines
XD
OLINES
YOU HAS THEM
lolol
... LOOOOOOOOOOOL IT'S THIS EPISODE
haha
wtf is a olines
I'm on 20 channels, across 3 networks. I have 2 olines, 1 owners, 4 admins, 6 ops, 1 halfops, and 4 voices. I have the powers to help 49 people. I don't abuse son.

lmao
absurdly powerful student council/disciplinary committee is apparently powerful enough to get rid of a cropse o3o
Espeon
i blow you out of the water XD
!espeon
o-O
I'm on 30 channels, across 8 networks. I have no olines, 1 ownership, 3 admins, 3 ops, and there's no way I'm manually counting the rest
Espeon would never do that
12o-O
I also know a network I have an oline on
I own him
Therefore I can make him do that.
What.
HAHAHA OH WOW

THE CAKE IS A LIE

12i don't believe this chinese food place
A BIG FAT TASTY BURNING LIE
12their menu is so.... gigantic
the pie is truth then?
like a force a'nature~
lol
Interesting fact: in Singapore expressways are given three-letter acronyms
12their menu has 113 items
... PFFFFFFFFFT LOL
o3o
There are these particular two, Bukit Timah Expressway and Pan-Island Expressway
That are abbreviated BKE and PIE
12the best part is its a small little building as well with probably doesn't even seat 100 people
LOL
And they are connected to each other.
BKE PIE.
Bake pie!
12maybe like 60-70?
is there a SEX expressway? that would be obnoxious
</random useless trival>
o3o
Unfortunately... no.
it's a sign also
:3
lol
Just... no.
bake more pie
DO IT
/me tosses Espeon into the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator

LOOOOOOL
best tincanhead joke yet XD
12lol
12i thought it'd already had been said
Usually they should take back the menus
Once you finished ordering
At least that's the norm here
12they have copies
Infinite copies?
12seems like it
heh
12it just opened up a short time ago
12they probably are just trying to advertise
They are going to bankrupt themselves printing menus

02hey Alt
12Quan, if someone is proud of attacking a site and the people in it then serves them right that they miss the place and will miss it forever :3
02Glad to see you like my picture for you :P
02But umm...
02Nvm Arti
Articuno
but she doesn't miss it
now end of that
I talked to NS not too long ago
02You can say that but...
she was all
12o-o
I'm the one who fished things up and got arti peeved
12Quan said she did so thats why I'm telling her
I was all
'nice'
Lol
she doesnt
<__<
no way in hell she does
ffs
Cube
Articuno?
...
13LMFAO I found a download for LuffyFlag land
HOW CAN Cube kick people
/me logs TST's chat
7Well, NS said she missed my company. o3o
13http://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?page=6
when its not &'d
7Some people here, but not some others, I suppose.
12How can she miss your company if she talks to you? OL>
/me coughs
02I would miss your company too Quan :3
12...
SO true
LOL
02Lol you guys
:s
02Just because NS talks to Quan doesn't mean she does it all the time
Meeps
7Well, I hadn't talked to her in a while. :P
yes he's IRCop
/me sadface
13Hello Cube
06while I'm sure she misses some people
7I sometimes pop onto HoR.
12aaaaand thats got to do with missing TST chat how?
06I don't know why we're even dealing with this topic
06she's not coming back lmao
7The people that stay only on TST's chat.
bbl :<
02kk
Lol
well from what i've heard
i never brought it up
:3
nothing
well that's her problem LOL
@ Quan
so yeah
13o3o
02Her problem is nothing
02Seems you have a problem with her instead
7Who?
02Not that I'm going to sit here and say that it's wrong or anything, I'm not you
12She WAS a problem but we eliminated it
02Lol you sound like you killed her
12I did
12Off the chat
12XD
then that's her problem LOL
XD
<~Articuno> She WAS a problem but we eliminated it
XD
7Huh, I hadn't noticed the 'most consecutive days active' section at the bottom of the chat stats.
Yeah
i lol'd at this
/kill command!!
sorry
The expression made me lol
13XD
12How are you?
I am good thanks.
13???
Yourself?
02I wanna troll them but I'll be all sadface when they ban me D:
7Strange thought: We could almost turn her into a running gag.
and yeah i join TST chat and i see that
12If someone's gonna spout off false info about people, expect people to discuss it
sure is mature around there
13LOL
12Seriously, you say a banned member misses TST chat, I say LOL AT THEM
7o3o
13LOL
7Was that at me?
i'm sure average age has nothing to do with that
12Yeh
12I'm alright.
i guess the fact several people here invalidates that statement doesn't matter so
7How's that info false?
Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯
lolface~
12Um, because first you said they miss TST chat and now it's "well actually they just miss me and maybe a few others"
06my gosh, WHY are we discussing her?
13XDDDD
02Age does not equal maturity
06she's banned, end of story
^
7Well, that's what I meant, and sure, let's stop here.
13â–²vâ–²
Yes.
12I'm discussing the fact that Quan said something dumb that was obviously going to make people laugh.
:P
06^lol
12It is the year... 2005!
7o3o
13XDDD
7What, NS?
laugh? o.O
7Or my collective use of 'chat' as 'people'?
12Obviously
02I don't, what happened? :O
i'm pointing to the kids in there but it seems that the ones arguing aren't so point invalid
Oh lol
I remember that
13â™£â–’â™£
walk in, see NS, walk out
yes
02Loool

/me pokes SkySky's face
/me is gonna go play some Pokemon..... bbl
and no Arti, I didn't know til now
7http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5523.msg205307#msg205307 <-- I lol'd at this person's response.
12^^
hi
=3
12.....
oh oh wait
for once i can quote my sig and it will be true!
Saying the truth != being mean
/me tugs various tails
10eep
how can you drive a person knowing an answer to ANY question insane?
pretend to be deaf?
ask him: "What is the one question you can't answer?"
12I was going to say that!
12DAMN XD
04haha cant get mine, cause mine ish tiny
.... LOL
12Although
still big enough to be caught :3
12If they said "This one" it would be wrong because they would have answered it
12So then they can't say that
12and then headsplode things happen
aye
another riddle for all of you:
06video camera + youtube time lolololol
>_>
/me 's tail floofs
/me clings to his tail
06arti
06remember I had something to ask you like a week ago
06but I forgot?
You're in a dungeon and have two doors in front of you. One door leads to freedom, the other one has a monster behind waiting to kill you. Each door has a guardian in front of it. One of them will always tell the truth, the other one always lie at you. You're allowed one question. How do you find out which door leeds to freedom?
12Yes?
/me clings to Skylands to avoid getting washed away by the floofwave
06I remembered
Fly!
06Are you going to show all the entries to the pokemon in love contest?
12I already did
06...
12-v- lol
12AGES ago, check the topic silly XD
06I swear I checked that topic like last week
10lolwhut
12http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5426.0
think about it a bit :)
you can fly, can't you?
I'll give the answer in 15 minutes^^
then DO IT
if nobody finds it til then of course^^
06oh wel BLERUERHGUEHGH
/me has no wings?
06now I see it o-o
10I'm no birdy
12*Sigh* I don't feel like thinking right now :> but ok
guess where I stopped scrolling
i mean hi
04i only fly when riding SkySky's shoulder :P
well... then what are you?
if you can fly then do it. or even jump
/me dunnos
10usually whatever I feel like being
10hm
OH i see
ok
10I should be Zorua
12Ask them what the other would say
/me hasn't been Zorua in a long time
06don't you ask which is the wrong door?
12Same thing I guess?
12I dunno
correct Arti and roara
10Floofox
04OoO I get to sit on the back of a Zorua? WHERE IS MY SADDLE?
04XD
04jk
10o.O
06:>
and - which door would you pick then?
02I think I'm starting to hate Reshiram
06the one they don't point to
10because everyone else seems to like it?
12Im too fried to get around this one
12Let me see
02Yup
10Thought so
/me still likes both
lolage
10Zekrom just bugs me a bit
10it's too similar to Palkia
10and Reshiram's head and such resembles Suicune
02I lol at that when Reshiram has Palkia's feet :3
12If you said "Which is the wrong door" to the lying one, and it pointed to door 2, why would you go to door 1?
I just don't like any of them so :3c
Why not just ask which way is the way you want me to go XD
i like both
lol
10Zekrom - Transformer
02Lol
12How will that help?
02Keep going Sky
06let's say Door A is the wrong one
02Only Zekrom sucks?
12Ok
04VOLTRON!
02Nah, I don't think either of them are really that great
10Resiram - Digimon
02It's just the hype
12Zekrom has palkia's legs lol
06the question you ask is "which is the wrong one?" the truthful one will point to door B
12But thats a lie?
02Nope
06wait
06fff
12I thought you said A is the wrong one?
/me is watching Voltron on Youtube
06*the truthful one will point to door A"
who knew they could make the nina scene all the more suprsing
06sorry x-x
Zekrom > Resiram though
12Ok but the lying one would point to B?
02I can agree with that Alt
12So how would you know?
12lol
06...
06wait
12LOOL
10Tsutaja > all
02Nope
06I swear that worked out in my head a minute ago
10all meaning of the starters
02I know
02And I'm still saying nope
12I have to go in a sec >v<
12lol
06T_T
02Favorites != best
12My fav show in da whole world is starting
12the grass one's kewl
10because none of them top Zorua & Zoroark
grrr :V
06which?
02wb
12http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/uk/
thnx
12lol
02Again
12wb lol
/me floofs any Zorua's
wise words
02:P
12lol
06oh that's cooooool :>
I wanted to say springsomething XD
k, I will explain :)
12Quickly, I need to go
you stand in front of one of the guardians and ask
"Which way would the other tell me to go to safety?"
and choose the other door
not weird Reshiram got hit by ze rule first
after all
the truthful one would know the other one would lie and point me to the wrong door
SKYLANDS WIN
XD
the not truthful one would know the other one would point me the way to safety and lie at me instead
12LOLAGE!!
HAHA
06.....wait what
04:D Oracion!
so - no matter whom I ask, I'll always get the same door for answer
06oh wait
06dsskfh
12oracion=pwnage
12XXXD
06I hate riddles
12that still makes no sense
12I still can't work it out
12LOOOOOOL
/me lies on the next person
04IKR!
o.o
12So, the truthful one would point to door B?
12i've heard that riddle so many times
It makes perfect sense ^v^
i saw Zekrom before Reshiram
06we're all pessimistic riddle people
04im listening to it as im playing it on violin, :D
12and the lying one would point to door B why?
let's say: Door A leads to safety, Door B to death
of the rule of cours
e
You are just thinking about it too much ;>
12Wait yeh I got it
simplistic
06pessimistic :\
02YES
If I ask the truthful one the question, he'd know the other one would want to lead me to door B, so he answers "The other one would answer B"
02I'm a member finally
12The lying one would say that the truthful one would point to door B when actually the truthful one woud point to door A
lol well then you didn't see the first out of all of them
06negative people when it comes to riddles :P
yeah
12lol
12you know
12you ask them
12Anyway gotta run1 bye
12"what color is my hair"
06...
12then you know which one tells the truth
06bree has a point
the liar would know the other one, the honest one, would want to lead me to door A. But he lies with the answer and points me to door B, too
06except
06we don't know which door has paradise
12well
12argue that wasn't a question
12:P
12then when you win the argument then ask your question
well considering i wasn't online when they announced them
and you know your hair colour, but still not the exit...
yeah
06"I bet you don't know what color my hair is"
06is not a question
but a statement :p
12lol
02Oh sweet another comic *reads*
10.-.
well that makes sense
that's how fast it works
and I bet the guardian wouldn't answer to that :P
MY DRILL WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
12lol
10omai
nor would I :P
12LOLAGE!!
02Lol TeganToppa
12about your question though
12what if the guardians don't even know which one is the truthful one and which one lies
12huh :P
12lol
kipi: how did the arena go?
well, the honest one knows he's the one telling the truth...and the liar knows he needs to lie
12fine
12what if this is modern age
12and they ban that question
06LMAO
02Hey Sky, you know what a Zoroark is?
The arena is closed
10Shapeshifting werewolf?
02Lol yup

Mewtwo has a burning hate for Lucario
10Metwo: better not steal my chances at stealing Lucario's brawl spot. I am hating you so hard right now
oh that i've seen it lol
10Zoroark: ._.;
And Lucario is warning Zoroak
XD
i like Mew2's face also
but really they should do something more creative
really
12that's funny lol
12yeah
creative like...? :P
like NOT using the bipedal Pokemon revealed before the rest of their generation that's seemingly designed to look cool
oh btw. I found a creepy vid on YouTube reminding me of my lovely Lugia lady once again^^
*ahem*
Also according to the ways Zoroark is portrayed by a lot of people, something tells me he wouldn't smile unless he's about to kill something.
Run Lucario. RUN.
but he always smiles
._.
Evil smiles
he looks at you and he wants to kill you
o3o
well, two videos to be honest

to repeat what I said - just for you Roara:
/me runs
12donno
/me pushes SkySky
lulz
02Because that was his nickname a long time ago
12I thought it was someone ns doesn't like lol
D: and thats why i despise it.....still, I use it anyway
as some people still don't understand what and why exactly happened
04meh, doesnt like it
so many Lugias
:|
10I remember when I was Skylands_Lugia and everyone called me SL ._.
lol i remember
04XD
10Nick used SL recently
10I was like NO
LOL
04STIMULI!

04XD
o-O
04i hate L2X with a passion now
12lol
04makes me sound robotic
kinda does o3o;
12yeah, tbh
10any abbreviated names sounds robotish
12SS lol
12XD
04its like "Lugia" is the brand name, 2000X is the edition
10that's why I don't shorten names to numbers
10example: Light Lati, I just call her Light
12I call her LL
04hmm good point
04i always use Shiny, it would be wierd for someone to start calling SG
lol
02I've been called a lot of things
I like Alt as an alt
:S
10:P
04and Skylands is either Sky when im serious, or SkySky :D (only i say that though :P)
10alternative air

XD
XD
10Shi-shi o3o
02Yup, that too
04Shiny Ho Ho? That kinda makes me wanna catch a shiny santa in a pokeball :P

/me 7adds Rora to her list of kiriban-awaiting.

03Hi Alt o.o

04SkySky! *pokes*
04boo...MWUAHAHA
hey Sneas
03o.o
/me trades his eeveelution team over to HG
THIS sounds good
04cause im too cute of a Pokemon :P
03All female of course
/me hides

02Xeli would like the uncensored Dragon Ball
lol
04http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/0810/totodile-totodile-pokemon-nintendo-demotivational-poster-1224491277.jpg <----@Sky
plural amirite
/me hides
lol kid Goku privates are awwright
:<
02No, I still lol when he meets Buruma(Bulma)
02And he sees her naked in the tub and goes:
you mean when he checks her... "dragon balls"
oh that part
xD
02"Why do you have a butt on your chest?"
/me loled
ah HAHAHA
i lol'd at that i remember
04OoO BULMA NAKED?
02Yeah, he checked to see that too, that was so funny
i never watched dragon ball longer than 5 minutes lol
06...
06my laptop has a mic
06but now it's saying it doesn't
it was just pure lulz at the start before they tried to make it epic
more cartoon-ish
06the mic works in livestream
02You gotta read the manga instead, the anime probably doesn't have all that uncensored stuff
/me likes DBZ better
10Only thing I've seen from DB = over 9000
02That's from DBZ
02AND
10oh, and firin' mah laza
10r
02That's gonna show up this week :D
but that doesn't mean I didn't watch it
xD
/me also sneaks into Sneas' Eeveelution team :3
03LOL fail
02They're re-airing DBZ on a channel, and Vegeta is already on Earth so I expect him to say it in the next few episodes
are they fighting those plant men that comes out from capsules?
06so...I'll have to get the audio some other way
02Yes, that's tomorrow's episode lol
06ehwait
oh then it's closing in... sorta
but dbz DRAWS OUT everything so
yeah
06drf, you still have the audio for pokemon 3?
02I just liked how the channel had to hype everyone up
02This is what? A ten year old show?
02And they're going "DRAGON BALL Z KAI, NEW SHOW WATCH!!!1!1!!!1!"
lol
03audio fromw hat?
bah, it sucks
02And they had this going every commercial for 2 months
06the movie
06pokemon 3
03MYSTERIOUS QUESTION MARK IN SECOND SLOT OF TEAM.
06spell of the unknown
12Hello.
03why the frick would you use a microphone for that
03and I have the DVD...
03yeah but why do you need a mic>?
06I just need rough recordings of the songs
06I
If it's male then ignore it... yeah :3
06I'm gonna try remixing them lol
03with a mic?
03That'
03that'slike, the worst idea ever
06but it's fast :P
06but then again
03just use the actual audio file from the DVD
03no way
03decrypting the DVD is faster than realtime :P
03huhwut
06well then by all means
06may I have it lol
03yeah, I have to redo it though
ninja intrusion
06...lol
03but it's easy enough to extract audio from a DVD
6Hey
/me also laughs at Goku's innocent comebacks to Bulma
i actually thought it was Vulma
not bulma XD
03computer may cut off
:<
02Idk, her name is Buruma in the manga
02Aww
03nvm, it won't

{Timey-Wiki: Temporal Bubbles are a defensive attack and look very similar to a simple bubble beam - except for the colours.
Each blue bubble moves the area it hits 10 years into the future.
Each red bubbles moves the area it hits 10 years into the past.
Temporal equilibrion is maintained this way, but the object being hit by the swarm of temporal bubbles usually collapes due to extreme temporal fraction

Sergal
/me runs
plus I need to add an information to what's supplied here: Whenever you add or modify anything on the car (even changing wheels!) you need a general operation clearance for your car. If not you need to go to the inspectors so they can check the car again and confirm everything's okay. If you don't do so, your operation allowance for the car is nullified
02Sergal?
freaky fox thing IIRC oAo
02Hey Quan~
02Some one else made that up though
Not uh!
dam.. that does look hard
I seen it
When I lived in Texas
no joke i beat though in 7 tries lol
02Well...I'm trying to have things that are original in their own way
02Like a Turtleduck lol, except that wasn't my idea
Horsefly?
SpiderMonkey
And I think you're thinking of Turtledove
:L
03heh, my mom had an idea
03she was like "Well I can drive the rental and you can just drive my car"
03that would work X
03*XD
02But those are already living creatures
>_> wonder why nintendo put a 1up behing that house though
02Meaning I need something that's made up and that it is somewhat your own idea
Birdrat
in case of your anti climatic suicide
/me writes it down
i dunno
Hey
Forgot about this channel
Fish bird thing. That'd be neat. Flying underwater and all
lol
lol
Lol.
everywhere else id dead
*is
It could cover all transportation
02Flying fish lol
I'm so bored.
everyone playing galaxy 2 lol
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE THE FISH BIRD
i would guess
Not right now, but my brother and sister are in the next room :P
I got bored of galaxy 2 .
cause her dad actually bought it and it is like the only game i know of that they approve of
They made a deal with me and my brother that if we both got jobs they'd buy us a "real" game
ah
I had completely forgotten about it
me2?
But my brother reminded them
LOL no
XD
without the 360
ha
I downloaded galaxy 2, its funny how uncreative nintendo is with story lines.
Plus my parents would never approve of anything M-rated
even though your 19 lol
I remember years ago I used to think the M rated games must be super bad all full of nuditiy and stuff
They don't care if I play it
nintendo isn't really known for their creativity anymore
12Yeh but you'd still be paying a stupid amoutn of monehy
But they don't want my younger brother and sister seeing it
But the truth is most of them aren't.
ah
03yeah
03but less
especially stories in mario games its always oh no bowser kidnap peach mario rescue her
03and it's my parents money anyway XD
I don't care about stories in most games
nintendo is a cliche turned to moldy cheese
12I was gonna start driving right..
03http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/89476/455190.aspx#455190 <-- Sigh, I fricking hate Windows sometimes
Unless they're actually /trying/ to have a cool unique story
*coughTLOS*
woof
o3o
03foxes can woof?
12and then I realised it'll cost me £200 a year just to learn using Xai's car and his instructions
:P
03and
lol
/me dies
yes
yes they can
03o.
Heavy Rain is pure story.
03*o.o
03my driver's ed was just a one time fee
12So I thought I'd be a cheapskate and not bother learning
03and it was only 3 weeks
i want to try out heavy rain
i wonder if its any good
i dont buy games for the story anyway so doesnt bother me if its good or not
I like Mario because of the gameplay, not the story
Like with SMBW
12It's different here, you have to be insured or take official lessons with an instructor and it's about £15- £20 a lesson at most
03wtf
There's just something about it that makes you really get into it
But I dont have a playstation
and theres no pc version
especially if you play with more than one person
i like the mario rpgs more than the platformers anymore
03here it's just, you go to a class for 3 weeks, do 6 hours of driving with an instructor (included with the class), then you get a permit to drive with your parents for 6 months
So I played their previous game, indigo prophecy
RPGs?
03after which you just take a road test, and if you pass you get your license
12I can't drive with even a lisensced driver unless 1. I am insured on that car or 2. It's on private land
aka Farenheight (sp?)
paper mario/mario &luigi
Ohh
Never played either of those
12Which is VERY hard to come by in England, most cheap people use carparks XD
they are good
Mario Sunshine was awesome though
03heh
only played super paper mario
I just wish the ending was better
paper mario has a pretty decent story line
i didnt like mario sunshine...
o.o
Really?
12I learned to move a car and stuff in circles using a carpark with Xai but that was two years ago
nothing really excited me in that game
12I havent tried since then simply because I dont wanna pay LOL
That was one of my favorite games since the first three Spyros
12It's not that I can't afford it, I am just being cheap
12£200 a year!?! TST costs that!
the only part that i actually wanted to play over again was teh manta boss
ahahaha, I hated that one
it got so frustrating
I didn't mind it when I replayed it though
oh yeah i remember him was annoying
i just wish nintendo games had an adjustible difficulty
03XD
03my server cost me $7 for a full year
/me hides
12XD
it was hard getting the last few of him
12Anyway
03well
03it's usually a certain cost a month
03but it was a promo deal
03and that's what I like doing
Indigo prophecy is like guitar hero with a controller.
No jok
03jumping from host to host and grabbing the first-time sales :D
hm?
brawl has difficulty levels in the story and the metroid games
joke*
12I want to drive more than anything right now because I hate that Xai does all the work driving us around and I can't take over if he gets tired
/me adds snake with that fish bird
you basically do button combinations seen on screen the whole game
yeah but thats brawl
huh..
red green blue and yellow.
02And you probably won't know what this is NS, but lol
Over and over and over.
02What I asked you a few nights ago anyways, even if it's just a dream I'm gonna keep dreamin
its pretty linear too.
I wish we had Brawl...
you could get it
No
Rated T
12I gotta go!
its onnly T
12Sjsflksadjgadg
...
So my sister couldn't play it
12:D/D:
lol oh come on
She's 12
12Sorry/Seeya!
GEEZ
I know
It's stupid
ESRB doesnt know how to rate games.
03:(
03k
bye
D:
Im sure she watches worse tv shows.
Nah, she doesn't watch TV
It's so stupid though
12Random trip out quickly :D
/me leafs
The only reason it got the T rating is because of the guns
ESRB rates it T if the word "shutup" or "idiot" appears in the game.
wtf, really?
Wow
in that case, im sure she hears worse at school.
only thing wrong i see with brawl is the way that solid snake is laying on top of samus
They don't have anything like that in Melee
And that got the T rating too
or compromising positions that result in halarious laughter
the GTA series has a lot of innuendo
i immagin
but theres no nudity like ive heard
remember the coffee shop mod?
I dont mod games
yeah but have you heard of it?
GTA IV has really nice graphics though
yeah
hot coffee
ah
yeah
Was it that hidden porn scene?
yes
that they had but removed.
Just Cause 2 is a really nice looking game
id recommend it to anyone.
the map is HUGE
but then came me which had 10 seconds of flesh fondling
i need to try red dead redemption
my brother bought it a while ago
ive heard of that.
sort of a cowboy style gta i guess
Saints row
really?
never tried saints row
but hear its like GTA
but co-op
you can play two player through the whole game
id figure it was a gta wana be
http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1442633/ my poor bro T_T

that pic above was not photoshopped
wtf
02The uh...
XD
wth o_O
there would have to be a reason why there is a 100 foot smooth hole in the middle of a city going strait down then...
its a sinkhole
but for it to be a really smooth hole in itself makes it sort of a longshot too
hell i dont know
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATpSPNIuj3M
it reminds me of gears of war
Ahh. the dove comes out of his jacket.
so did the cheese
this guy is pretty good though
the only real magic trick the ipad can do is make $600 disappear from your wallet.
lol
ha
haven't seen him
hmm
Since I banned him from my channel
i'm wondering if he got tired of us then..
I dunno
He probably just has stuff going on in his life
That last night we saw him where we were all talking about my computer couldn't have pissed him off that much on its own
yeah but he all of the sudden got all pissy
He's that age
he started snapping at me
15 right?
yeah
Yeah, 15 sucked
my brother is 14 and hes not that way
he was when he was 12 though
My sister's 12 and she's like that now
but they all go through it different
It's different for everyone I guess
Yeah
oi... my brother was a freakin brat...
haha
he deserved half the crap i gave him
I unbanned him though so that can't be why he's not here
Also wouldn't stop him from getting into here and draconicwolves
yeah
Yeah, he's taking the job
They have to do another offer though
what are his days?
ah
He doesn't know yet
how about you? how are you doing over there?
He should have gotten the right social security number :P
lol
It's actually not too bad
/me hugs back
It doesn't really seem like 9 hours
they keep me busy
thats good
thats why i told you not to get door greeter or cart pusher
youd be bored to death
Haha, that would be so boring
started wearing ankle weights to work now
o.o why?
it feels like i'm walking through water
i havent been getting out of the house lately so id figure id get more exercise at work
its only 16 pounds
I'd be dead at the end of the day
you get use to it
i was dead every day for the first 4 months when i started cause i wasnt use to walking on the hard floor and the hours exausted me
my feet hurt like no other
There was a lady at bestbuy who was going to buy an ipad for her son whos going to college
her son is now going to get cash instead of a big piece of alumnium.
hmm
i like cash
They haven't been telling me to do them
I had some that were incomplete my second day
i tried dodging them too but they eventually caught me
But they disappeared
=/
haiz
well when you go to "my learning center" it should be on the right on what cbls you have left
Yeah
unless you completed them all (including the ones not due until who knows when) you probably have a few left
There used to be incomplete ones, but I logged in again later and they weren't
So I don't know if I don't have to do them or what
half of the cbls are freakin retarded...
I like the ones about diversity and being nice to people
XD
it's like being back in 3rd grade
lol i liked the ones about sextual harassment in where 4 out of five were done with female against male
J?
Oh yeah, haha
SR: Walmart
hahahaha
only one example had the typical sextual harassment theme
The computer learning things they make you do are completely retarded
Id like to go in for a fake interview
and be extremely racist or something.
haha
yeh?
i imagin they get those quite a bit
it's not exactly hard to get hired there
nah it's ok obsi
They probably call every application they get for an interview
like i said... they aren't exactly choosy in who they get
I have a new buddy whos manager at mcdonalds
I noticed
they hired a deaf guy along with me
Im getting all the good info about how they operate their stores now.
really
/me nodnods.
hi!
I dont know what use that will be, but you never know.
hi!
are their bugers really beef or is it brothe basted soy
The department manager I was working with told me about this kid who works there who's "slow"
"But you just have to talk a little more slowly and be nice to him!"
ah
i understand that sort of thing
Yeah
I wonder how he deals with customers though
but i hate it when they take advantage of their diabilities
They're not going to know he needs that
that was hard
/me lulz at the current song on icecast
the deaf kid would often get me to help customers for him and when he spilled something he would sometimes leav it for someone else to clean
here are some tips
not gonna XD
1. you are now friends with everyone, everyone is your buddy.
I''ve got the feeling it's gonna trigger something
aoeu
See it didn't trigger anything :)
oh crap i forgot my list...
damnit.
:P
asdf?
Lol
I have a list of 4 points
lol
But i forget the way I worded it.
what keyboard do you use?
1 your friends with everyone 2 crap i forgot the next one... 3 damit.. 4 shit i dont mean that was one of them
Dvorak :)
asdf
oh yeah... dont forget about your almost worthless walmart discount
ah
Yeah, I haven't forgotten
We'll probably be using my discount to buy groceries
you cant
http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?77
what kind of discount do you get?
10%
only general merchindice can be discounted
Aw, really?
>_> lame
That sucks
like what can you buy?
I might need to get you to buy me stuff so I can get a discount.
food doesn't count unless its like snacks or something
anything other than food or clearence items
Yeah right, because you'd totally save money with all the shipping
:P
I'll probably buy my new TV there
And a computer if I can find a good one
your usps shipping is cheap in the usa.
it is anymore
id recommend either just getting the highest walmart has or just look at another place for another computer
I was looking at their computers last week
the most walmart has is like a HP dv6 i think
around 700
hey
they don't have a great selection, but it's at least better than my netbook
:D
Hey
:D
Man now this is a song I haven't heard in forever XD
asdfghjkl
its my favorite letter in the greek alphabet
/me falls to the ground
/me flees
Hah, now is the walmart club complete?
and icy dragon like ya too
Lol yeah
it is...:(
Haha
All three of us are here
:P
We need a channel
XD
toilet duty?
lol
XD no
Umm, something to do with Star Wars
I have a walmart laptop
best laptop i own.
*sigh* no
:P
Brian's graduation party
I thought that was yesterday
no that was a different one
get a drink?
I've only been to one graduation party ever
Lol he doesn't drink
not in front of you he doesnt
XD
if Coke counts then yes
Drinks himself to sleep every night.
/me 7blinks
7LOL, Obsi.
With water yes
You drink behind my back huh?
7You actually added those fail peas. XD
I do drink when you aren't around, but again it's water and pop
I havent decided if im going to drink.
So all that stuff about not even wanting to drink when you're 21 was all BS?
7Unless all of them are added accidentally. O_o
There are a lot of alchoholics on my dad's side.
and my mom's side only has one or two.
I don't think there are any alcoholics in my family
so im not sure if it would be a good idea.
i dont drink cause it all tastes nasty
So I'm probably safe
if i do its to releive stress
But I think I have enough self control do drink.
I want to at least see what it's like when I'm 21
We've migrated back to Spyrochat, eh?
/me curls up on Quan's tails and falls asleep
My cousin was trying to give me vodka
and my aunt was trying to give us all wine
I've had alcohol before
ah
the way I see it
ive never had vodka though..
it's different seeing all the activity there again
lol
you need to take the mystery out of it for kids.
My great aunt and uncle conviced my parents to let me have a glass of wine at their house
howd ya like it?
And my dad refilled it for me when it was empty
XD
otherwise they will think its forbidden and cool, and do it whe you're not looking.
It was OK
That's what my parents always did
My aunt drinks a minimum of 3 bottles of wine at my parties.
They offered to let me have a taste of their alcohol sometimes when they had it
and take a sip
/me hides
yeah, I do that too
7MIB
7LAG
I might not invite her this year
i personally dont like it but some people just love it
I haven't drank alcohol since I was three
02Yes, I brought the MIB upon us
oi 3 bottles..
because theres no wine left for everyone else.
lol
she pass out??
no she has a tolerance.
Is the drinking age 21 everywhere?
yeah i think so
its 21 here
in BC
19 for tobacco.
My little cousin who lives in Louisana seemed to think it was 18 there
in europe the rule of thumb is if you can see over teh counter you can drink
18 for tobacco here
Yeah, that's what I thought
Yeah, in Europe it differs though
In Germany I think it's 17
for examplke
I think it's younger than that
and at that it is very lax
They're /really/ strict about drunk driving though
in spain they have vending machines for alcohol
So no one does it
Protip: Don't drink to impress anyone.
yeah
lol
My cousin was hit by a drunk driver
she was in her 2nd year of college
I think if they get busted for drunk driving they get their licenses taken away
now she has brain damage, she acts like a 10 year old child.
And their tests are really hard to pass
only way drinking can make me impress anyone is by making me talk more than usual and actually dancing
hmm
in euroup they have stricter standards for driver's licenses too
any test is probably harder than the foodsafe test.
XD I think drinking helps you impress people more if it's them who's drinking
Haha
ha
I want to go to a college party sometime and not drink
i need to learn how to dance....
You do?
Just to watch everyone acting like idiots
Ah
the teacher stands at the front of the class and while your taking the foodsafe exam she gives you the answers.
We should go to one of Matt's next year
:P
Hahahaha
If he throws up on me he's dead
its about the same as when we got our firearms licenses.
yay sr for being an armed citizen
rdx would be proud
XD
although the guy who gave us the licenses is now not allowed to teach anymore.
:P
ha
I'll never own a gun
hes an indian.
No use for one
!!!!!!!!!!!!
Theres always a use for a gun.
Like when?
shooting things.
I don't like killing things
And the point of that is?
Wasting lead?
Its a skill, marksmanship.
its like any other sport.
Hes a liberal
A skill I have no use for
Lol yeah
I make fun of him for it all the time
:P
She does
She really does
I wish BC was a carry province.
though I never make fun of her for her views
:P
washington is awesome
Because my views make sense
:P
(jk) *shot*
No, cause I don't own a gun
XD
I should buy more guns.
You don't make fun of me because you don't own a gun?
make a collection.
no you said *shot*
id carry one but i'll wait for the next election for the new sheriff that would actually do something to help me with my license
Oh, got it
:P
but even if I did I would never ever do that
my grandpa got his restricted license
yeah, I would hope you'd never shoot me...
with those you can get all the good stuff
not just rifles.
its probably easier to get in the usa
around here you have to go through all this bs.
i got some of the good stuff
I have a box cutter I got from work
XD
XD

:P
I don't know what happened to it...
just a sec
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/2010-05-02%2018.06.13.jpg
we shoot coyotes with the .22
A friend of mine always talks about how he carries a knife with him everywhere he goes
All it does is creep me out
(^thats not a .22, just a little pellet gun)
You have weird liberal friends
and he talks about how he sleeps with a shotgun by his bed
He's censervative actually
Maybe not this one
*conservative
But most of them
I keep my stuff under my bed.
there have been break ins around here
Id have no problem shooting someone who broke in here.
never had a breakin
me neither
But we did leave our garage open once and my brother's bike got stolen
heres one similar to one of mine
especially home invasions, you should be able to blast anyone who does such a thing.
http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww270/skyking749/101_2748.jpg
any spyro news?
nope
i dont think so
Hello
o.o that's a huge gun
... my old brother has multiple break ins.....
thats the kind I want to get
not big at all
I probably couldn't even carry that thing
but those are illegal here.
>.>
not really
I like that style.
Oh my friend I was talking about has one of those
I amdit
you can get them in canada but high capacity mags are restricted i think
I've fired it once
whats wrong with firing it?
Nothing
at a milkjug filled with water
XD
I'd fire it too if I got a chance
Just not at something alive
all fully auto weapons are illegal here
its not fully auto
The one I fired was a semi-automatic version of it
I know.
but im just saying, fully auto is illegal here
Pretty sure it is here too
It is here too
it isnt in minisoda
apparently its not hard to modify some weapons for fully auto though
It's not?
Huh
it is hard
I always thought it was
what does fully auto mean anyway?
machine gun
first it takes knowledge of wtf your doing and then it takes milling
whats semi-automatic?
My uncle's friend has a fully auto AK he brought up country we used
semi- one pull one shot
when you have to pull the trigger once per bullet fired
spyroforum gun club.
a lot of people that talk about modifying a gun to f/a talk about filing the fireing pin or messing with the sear.... thats a good way of screwing your self...
well, see ya in the funny pages
yeah you dont want to mess with stuff unless you know what you're doing.
/me floofs Feather
she hasn't been home all day
So I haven't asked yet
Droid Eris, isnt that like a hero?
I don't see why not
file the fireing pin you risk peircing the primer or unleashing several slamfires
I'm thinking about buying a new phone with a data plan
whats droid eris?
I don't know what a hero is
A phone running Android
But it would cost $30 a month
Get up to date on your cellphone models!
I have a buddy who works for tmobile
Which would suck if I couldn't get a job during hte school year
he can activate your sim for a month for $20
i'm interested in a mobile media player that runs on android
but you need to get a new sim every month.
And I also just got a new phone
/me is an android evangelist
So it would be kind of a waste
$20 month full data unlimited txt/voice everything
i want something comparable to the ipod touch but not an ipod
I use Verison
It would be $30 per month
Oh you do?
Yeah
I do too
Verizon has a funny network
I think that means we get free mobile to mobile
I thought you said Verison didn't work in your area
If I did I said the wrong brand
I think that was AT&T
I'm pretty sure you said Verison
I think I did too
Because I remember you mocking their commercials
I have rogers, which is at&t compatible.
where they say they're the largest network or whatever
yeah
verizon has the best coverage.
I forget which one it was
but I do have Verizon now
yay for free phone calls
there are a ton ofgreat phones out now
htc incredible, sprint evo
oh yeah... how does skype work for you guys?
anythign with android will be good.
skype on android?
I finally got it working
My connection sucks though
With my crappy 80s microphone
So it disconnected us at one point
is it pretty choppy?
Not really
Not on my end
just disconnects
I'm kind of mad that my microphone on my netbook broke though
7Gordon, new ones are on ^^

What?
lol
Except Sneas but he's an op :E
"self determination"
XD
elf-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation and personality, concerning peoples inherent growth tendencies and their innate psychological needs. It is concerned with the motivation behind the choices that people make without any external influence and interference. SDT focuses on the degree to which an individual’s behavior is self-motivated and self-determined (Deci & Ryan, 2002).
I suppose. But so is the english language.
Lol elf-determination
Elf-determination: The will to make toys
STD are usually acquired by having unprotected sex with someone who is infected with an STD, another common method is by sharing drug needles with people who are infected.
Ewww
needles!
ugh >_<
Because she's too cool for them, and her loud voice may frighten some people.
lol
I don't know that.

7Oops. O_o
Gliscor?
yep
the only thing he used...
He told me he pretty much swept your entire team with it
wb
i just wonder how his gliscor out speeded my magnezone..
EVs
>:^[
You'd be surprised how much EV training helps
Plus Magnezone's not actually that fast
http://www.smogon.com/dp/pokemon/magnezone
ah well... i sorta am burned out on pokemon bulding this team
probably went through dozens of them to get a really good 1 thats what i dead to get strong pokemon
I EV'd my Machamp's Attack completely
did*
Compared to http://www.smogon.com/dp/pokemon/gliscor
but i thought speed was gliscore's second lowest stat
it's awesome when it levels up
Special Attack is its lowest
gets double digit points for attack and like 2 for everything else
Yeah, it helps a lot
So do IVs, but I don't bother with thouse
*those
Those are mind numbing
what are ivs?
Individual Values
random stats i think
They're randomly given out to a Pokemon at its birth or encounter with you
do personality stats make much of a difference?
o ok
get a new pokemon they get random nubers assigned to stats
Yeah, they do
http://www.smogon.com/dp/natures/
but i mean... like between brave an adament... do they make much of a difference?
i think it s 1 -30 or something dont remember
I forget how much of a boost you get from a beneficial nature
10%
But it makes a difference
boost
Oh
Brave is probably not good if you want a sweeper type
Lowers speed, raises attack
Adamant is good though
Raises attack and lowers special attack
yah ity raises attac lowers spc attack
Is sweeper when you sweep in, attack, then switch out?
.... to slow lol
High speed and attack
i normally focus on 4 natured adament modest jolly and timid
Yeah, those are usually the best
Because if you use attack, you're not going to need special attack, and vice versa
i just hate spending that much time breeding and raising them for that
Sup
thar he is
There he is
hi
i used to wi0pe the floor against my friend and he cheated with 63 points on each stat >_>

True

I;ve never had trout
I made him eat fish
brother took responsibility.... lol i'm not even gona repete some of the things he said
Lol
Can't be worse than Cynder porn
True
so say it
:P
We're already mentally scarred enough
hm... picking up a turd and having to flush it in the other bathroom...
Hm
almost
Yeah, Cynder porn is worse

Anyways!
Yeah so as we were saying
What were we saying
blarg blarg blarg
and now I love it
what kind of fish did you try>
Telapia, trout, and cod
mild fish
and fake chartwells fish
Catfish is better than all of those
Lol
I have yet to try catfish
catfish is alright
Fake fish, mm
I'm glad I'll have more spending money so we can eat out more
Chartwells sucks
!kill
;-;

Red mullet, swordfish, and salmon are good.
Pizza, burgers, chicken

Swordfish?
Woah

never had swordfish
Me either
Sounds good though
:D
i hate it when they put teh vertibre of salmon in teh meat...
12I love meat...
yeah, that's the problem with this trout
Crawfish, crab, and shrimp are really good though
all the bones are still there
so I have to pick around them
I wish we were going to Louisiana this summer
I love shrimp!
We wouldn't be able to eat the seafood anyway

Yeah, it'd be too oily
Oil spill

I scheduled my test as soon as I got home

But it's not until the middle of June
I did tell her that my friend from Indiana asked me to go to Florida with him
hmm
that was the earliest time they had
but I think she took it as a joke
Yeah, my mom would too lol
Because his parents are worse than mine in some ways
but she pointed out that I still have one day's worth of a Disney World ticket left iover
*over
They seem to think he's still 13
They do
>.>
I couldn't drive to her house alone
lol my mom was similar but she never stayed around me very long
At least my parents understand the fact that I'm an adult now
she really couldnt do a thing to me
/me currently playing sonic racing online

He hates pretty much everyone too
=/
He likes me for some reason
=/
Depends
:p
If I beat him in an argument, he hates me
XD
Maybe that's why he likes me
lol
brb watermelon
I don't argue with him
I just mock him\
Yeah 'cause you suck at arguing
:P
True
I suck at arguing tenfold
God I love VLC :)
You just have to keep repeating it until he's forced to acknowledge it
lol XD
My God, I'm just looking over tht Twinoob's comment, and I've only just managed to understand part of it.
IT TOOK ME A WHOLE DAY TO PROCESS IT
I can argue...but not on a live chat
I have to think about it for a while XD
lol
I can argue, but not with my dad
I can never argue
/me has been recording the stream :)
Because he doesn't listen to logic
I just start spewing stuff that only makes sense to me
"I don't want to talk about this anymore"
Exactly
Ugh
03what stream?
Icecast
I tend to argue even when I kind of know that what I'm saying is wrong, but just because I'd started arguing it in the first place. XD
03LOL
Although this song, well, always gets me weepy. It was played at my first girlfriend's funeral.
03why not just ask Articuno for the mp3s?
And continue arguing it until I get conclusively proved to be wrong. O_o
03o_O
03she died?
03of what?
Haha, I do that too
Burn.
She died in 9/11. Need I say more?
03Ouch
03oh.
That's how I almost lost one of my arguments with A Guy
03sorry to hear that :/
1986/04/19-2001/09/11
10Aww :<
03what song?
/me hugs Obsi
If tears could bring you bac
the previous song
03ah
03k
Haha, I thought it was LoneKnight
Then SR
THEN A Guy
:P
Eh, who knows
:P
XD
Haha
Then LoneKnight was sort of intermittent, once I'd found out you hated it him, then SR was last.
We have A Guy to thank for that one
Because I stopped doing it after SR banned me, which makes sense for him to be last. XD
Oh yeah
Haha
I remember you being banned
It was over some stupid thread in the Spam forum
Yeah, maybe I took things too far. :P
Where we were all characters in Greek mythology
/me was Hera
Uh oh
Hera's evil
Isn't Hera the Goddess of mother nature?
thriller, the 2nd best song jackson has made
whats going on?
/me ooooohs.
She's like the queen goddess
Because she's married to Zeus
She's also his sister
Yay Geraldan's theme
wow
I know
so sr is both a pedo and an incest
XD
XD
How is Zeus a pedo?
Oh, Goddess of marriage and women, I got it wrong.
13 year old girl
Nah, Athena is Zeus's daughter
Hera is married to Zeus
dam i screwed that up
Athena was born when she burst from his forehead
:P
Didn't Zeus cheat on Hera to have Athena?
now shit is gettin unreal here... since when does the male figure head give birth
He cheated on Hera tons of times
And Hera always ended up killing someone because of it
Because Zeus ate the mother once Hera found out he'd cheated on her.
All the Greek gods cheated
except the virgin ones
and Hephaestes
cause he was ugly
Lol
but he got cheated ON
I think someone was Hercules
Who was it?
/me is lacking in his greek mythiology
What do you mean about hercules?
Someone in our story
oh okay
With the Spyrochat people
I thought you meant he was also a greek god
which eventually he was
when did thisgo on?
:D
Card?
Remember you posted all those cards of the mods?
I bet RDX is doing some kind of Memorial Day thing
RDX was SR's lapdog or something
Nope.
Since he's in the US military
*is
It was either Pokemon or Yugio cards
Can't remember which
I dunno, if I had any part in it, I can't remember it.
12Wow, I just walk out of my room, and everyone is gone, and no one told me.... I'm really loved.
LOL
But there was a card you wouldn't show me for fear of being banned
lol
Hmm.
I wonder if I can find it.
Maybe I vaguely remember this.
LOL
You eat owls and cats
So that's worse

Snowmuncher, eh?
blarg?
Snowmuncher is a game on Neopets
XD
I've played that game way too much
I'm good at that game
I assume you played as Luigi
Lol.
I would go gay for that voice...
but then it's not a dar of dirt
yes, dar
o3o
...ew
dar = to give! :D
Or I used to be when I played a lot
I remember neopets.
Yay, Spanish class
I would play as Luigi
Hahaha
That's why it sounded familiar
uh
I kind of lost interest recently
10I have a Spanish exam tomorrow
but I started as mario so I stuck with it
10that I didn't study for
/me hides
Whatchya learning?
I NEVER study
10Hm
:D
10lemme check my papers
:D;;
yep
Sometimes
and Jenna
Jenna was always Luigi
sometimes she was "jihad toad"
most of the "Imma back!"s came from here
:P
Lol
lol
Haha
You were a horse with your bouncy head
?
Always making me fall off the edge
"You're such a Whoo..rse"
xD
10This is what it says: imperfect tense, preterite tense, disaster & accident & cooking vocab, affirmative and negative tu commands
our cousin said that one when we played it at his house
not sure why he called something a whore though...
Lol
He had to correct himself because Jenna was there
But for the rest of the night we called everything a horse
it was hilarious
:O
Preterite tense of which verb?
What?
The only things I know from that list are preterite of certain verbs and affirmative tu with an accent command. o3o;;
I was going to call my Harry Potter game a piece of crap and I thought maybe Jenna wasn't supposed to hear the word crap
Oh yeah
XD
so I called it a stupid piece of... boring and timewasting game
:P
10All verbs
03back
o3o
O:
10ar, er, ir
03and eh, Spanish, long time ago for me XD
Which doesn't even make sense
which made it even worse because my mom probably thought you were going to say "shit"

Umm, I think so
yay for math in my head
fear me for i am asian :P
Actually it's 512
shit..:P
great song...
XD@ video
:P
Someone posted that on facebook
lolz
2sin^2x = 5cosx - 1
barely started loading
Someone solve that for me. (;
Give me some time and I will
....@ math >_> ummmm no thanks its to late
:P
I think you need a calculator for that one dari
Nope.
Easy without.
I do
well I fail then
It's a quadratic.
...... grabs ti 84+ oh screw this :p
You've got to factorise it.
calculus drains the easy math out of your head
>_>
what's the sin/cos definitions again?
There were some formulas
dam... what does cos-1 equal again?
but I forget
sohcahtoa
No, not those
cos^2 - 1 = sin^2
but cos -1 doesn't equal sin
Ohh
Blargh
ah hell with dari's homework
But it's sin^2x
derivative of arcsec anyone?
That's not a quadratice
I don't know
*quadratic
it would be if that x wasn't in there
sin^2x = 1 - cos^2x btw.
It is a quadratic.
OK, that's what I was looking for
Trigonometric quadratic.
its been so long since i've done one of those
Wha'sup mah nigguhzzz?
:P
Ah, very nice.
just a heads up
oh crap
You all gave up...?
Hey
hey
2sin^2x = 5cosx - 1
I assume you mean 2sin/x/^2x?
A dud or dude?
Oh, thank you
lol
yes cod will answer all your questions dari
Woah, I've seen sin and cos on my calculators but I have no idea what they mean, lol.
XD
Wait for trig
I feel dumb because I used to like doing these problems
Oh, it's meant to be 5cos^2x.
But now I can't remember how
I'll wait...for the rest of my life.
Oh, that explains why it was so impossible
Thanks dari
:P
XD
z
...
5cosx^2x, right?
Yep.
You can't have just cos^2x
Well I dunno why but it's actually cos^2x.
That's how all the maths teachers write it.
I think he means square the whole thing
(cos x)^2
Yeah
British math probably
it's just that he didn't write the x
:P
but it's always wrtten weird in books
I've found the circle root of the squarecumference of a poly triangle.
with the squared after the cosine
cos²x
Like that.
10:P
yeah
Ah
Wait what?
I thought you meant cosx to the power of 2x
cos²x
arg
like this
http://www.katjaas.nl/sinusoids/cos2.gif
yeah, that's how it looked before you corrected it dari
Oink oink, my good man.
but take of the 2 pi
*off
Meh
it's too late for math
Yeah, but if you write cos^2x with no parentheses it means cosine of blank to the power of 2x
which makes no sense
yes, we know
:P
ENOUGH :P
NO

03so BOTH Versions are bad

but you get to keep insanity frm school though :p
to that old trig problem you posted half an hour ago?
Yep.
300 radians
?
Nope, degrees.
In radians would be...
so its 300 and 60 degrees...at the same time?
XD dari got impatient
:P
Yep, it could be either.
oh
it would be pi/3 right?
For 60 degrees, yeah.
yay, I remebered the conversion

I have no brother.
Hence the quotes
they rarely do
Well, even if I did have one, I couldn't be an Internet n00b since that would defy the prophecy.
when noobs mess up on the internet they blame a sibling, even if that sibling is nonexistant
not really

(that was what i was talking about)
o_O
5....Don't you hate when you spend like fifteen minutes to make the perfect reply to a roleplay and what you get back is just... not good at all? -le sigh-
06yup
there are SFX and voices in the way, and evem if you did managed to kill them, you would also take out some of the music aswel, i think
;o
\(at least, thats how CCX in A3 works)
06the only thing is I had to rip it from youtube, so it's horrible quality
:x
5What did you use to rip from Youtube?
03DownloadHelper is the only acceptable thing
5Because I've done some YT audio rips and they haven't been have bad.
5**half
06I used DH
Never thought you RPd, RP

^QFT
03it's the only thing that can record digital cable
too many functions
5Ohhh.
03and HD movies FTW
03wtf too many functions
03it's the opposite of OSX, it's actually USEFUL :P
5More functions = good? LOL.
03the only thing I don';t like is the fact that it complies with DRM standards
o_O
i was trying out WMC at a store
03did they have a TV tuner in it?
03as otherwise it's pointless
and i managed to break the playlist

/me 5is listening to The Shanghai Restoration's "Babylon of the Orient".
03and really I just use WMC to record, then I convert the files to something and play them in MPC LOL

Or I bet it at least gives you a warning that it's a "vital system file" or something.
02I could prolly test on my gov laptop
02yeah
02I think rmdir was only for empty folders
02think maybe rmdir C:\WINDOWS\system32 \S\Q might have been the command
02XD
You could do del /F /S /Q /A[[:]S]] *
02xD true
You could do del /F /S /Q /A[[:]S]] C:\
Actually.
02I think del system32\*.* would work
Would only delete system files. XD
02system32/*.*
02I meant that
And would not ask for confirmation.
Why don't you try it. :D
:P
02xD
02basically cd\windows
02then del system32/*.*
xcopy C:\ C:\WINDOWS\system32\
02that should work
02lol xcopy
02guess that'd work too
back murr
02wb
02:3
02i'm about to sleep
Or maybe Format C:\ /Q
you know some people will do that right
i can't really understand how they are that stupid though
also you need to include shutdown -s to complete the system rape
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
shutdown -i is fun.
At school. XD
It brings up the remote shutdown panel. ;)
yes that's funnier but not as rapeage
02Xeli
02.bat time then
02>:3
02like you 34shortcut.bat
02your*
series of tubes.bat is the sexiest
02XD
02well
02should make it a virus
02stick it on all computers
02and autoexec.bat...
02:D
that is not a bad idea at all
02all school computers*
02but then I'd get killed for it...IF they found out
02it was me
it would be quite funny to see all the school computers flooded by Eeveelution vaginas and penises. oh baby.
02XD
and add rickroll just to complete the illusion
02OH LOL
hundreds of synchronised rickrolls
02XD
02oh lol
02when they have a movie presentation in assembly

I mean two hours!
XP
Two hours to finish
But after that shenaningans, I'll be back

But either way
Waking up at 05:00 is still the dumbest thing ever
There's no reason for society to function that early. 3:<
12lol
12its so they can get a lot done
Yeah, like being DUMB.
12they expect people to drink down coffee and all this stuff that is bad for you to keep awake
Repeat

Bored.

14This PS2 is like my 6th
12better not tell him that XD
PM: "Kyu, your z's taste old and stale. :<"
the PS2 isn't very durable
I only ever had one PS2.
And it still works now.
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaany years later.
i only ever had one ps2. it still works when I use it to play ps2 gaems
Who wants to spot me $50 so I can get Red Dead Redemption? :D
because of COURSE my 1st gen PS3 had to YLoD. And then the replacement one. So now I'm stuck with a slim one
YLoD? Yellow...Line of Death?
The one thing that pissed me off about that game is that the main character has the same exact cheek scars as the dude from the first one, but they're different people. 3:<
Unrelated
yellow light of death
No affiliation
basically the exact same thing as the RRoD just for PS3
just rarer
x
12?
My friend suggested that John what's-his-face just changed his name, but he acts nothing like Red Barlowe!
It wasn't about the money

mIRC just refused to let me continue
be warned.
14That's why I have it reg'd
03I have a serial should anyone need it
03a legit one
/me is actually here for a few minutes
I do P:
but I have two copies to legit
03Full Name: TST User
03Registration Code: 5397-489611
mIRC starting to force people to register?
it's replacing "continue" with "exit" on mine
and it does exit when pressed
Wow
Mine's been uninstalling itself every now and then lately
12great
As in, the executable will be renamed to something and I will have to reinstall it again
14viruuuuus
03this is why mIRC 6.21 FTW
03none of that activation crap
12file hippo
Hmmm?
12hosts the earlier versions
03so does www.sysreset.com :P
12sysreset is just its very own modification of mirc
03right
12it's not really plain old mirc XD
03but I like it :)
12plain old basic mirc
14I like this copy of it :)
03meh 6.35
03it's the same program, it just looks different
Ah!
03and why bother with cracking it if you can just use this one
14Because pirating is more fun? :P
avast! been detecting it as a virus
14Anyway brb, trying to find me a copy of Command and Conquer Red Alert
12drf is about to say EWWW AVAST
No drf
12i guess
12*fursuit
/me rips it off
/me rips off the fursuit too
12ok
o.o
03yeah?
14You got a Win XP patch that will stop it asking for activation?
03Yes, but I thought yout ried it and it failed
03You wanted me to get you a legit serial?
14It's for me laptop (Legit copy of windows but I can't activate it without the net)
14I've actually sorted the desktop now so
03o.o
03if it's legit, just use the phone
14I cba to wait to get through to Microsoft
03it's instant
03it's just a computer
14Either way I don't have the number for it
03o.o
03it'll tell you
03click 'activate using the phone'
03and it'll tell you where to call
03and for me it was always just a computer
14Hold on let me boot up the lappy then
03you just punch in your numbers and it reads their numbers back
14Expired, wut
03o.o
03it said that?
just delete the offending "please activate!" executable from the HDD
!!!
14Something along those lines, pretty much
03hm
03so you want a crack? hold on

03that is some fricking fancy timestamping
03did it work?
14Yup
ONCE AGAIIIIIIIIIIIN
That virus is on my computer...
how did you manage that?
what happened?
Which/
i mean *idles*
?
it's been doing this since january
I had a false anti-virus program on my computer (as to how it got there, my dad says he didn't put it there but it was there after he wiped it clean)
got rid of it once, then it came back
I suspect your dad, then
got rid of it again, came back with a block on my usual antivirus
got a new antivirus, works and I'm scanning now
what's your usual antivirus, Aurora?
And what are you using now?
it's so annoying to have a popup come up every 4 seconds
my usual is either malwarebytes or microsoft security essentials
Eurgh, MSE. I've had nothing but trouble with that program.
I prefer Comodo myself, with a backup of MBAM
MSE worked fine for me
but yeah, I always had MBAM
*shrug* Might have had a buggy copy then
Avast is doing really well at this moment
blocking all the porn sites this virus is bringing up
before I have to see them -_-
schweet
\btw, i'd make a note of the addresses of those porn sites
why?
and add them to your hosts file with an entry of, say, 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255
both of which ar eIP addresses that don't exist XD
oh good, avast found some infected files and it's only halfway through the scan
/me waves to Quilava
hi
hihi
Wow, that makes so little sense.
whats up?
07zzz

^ Agreed.
12o-o

ARTI
12kyu loves his cokise
12cookies
Hullo
So....
I uhmm...
I panicked. .-.
I didn't do so well on the test.
12i told you not to panic D:
But, when I was talking to the advisor, she said I should take take the acupuncer test or whatver it's called
Also
I was wrong
It was only one test
The only reason why it took so long was because I was talking to an adviser
12i see
Of course... I'm gonna have to go back again to retake all three tests. XP
The first two, I did great, apparently
She said I came really close to getting into the honors classes
12i thought you just said it was only one test
I did one test _today_
12ok
Which was the math test of which I panicked on
So... the current plan for tomorrow is...
redo the morning routine we did today, so I have to wake up at dumb 05:00
Then drive there at 7:15
12oh
12i read that as reading & rocking
Annnnnnnd.... take the un-timed(but much longer) math test
XD
So whatcha think?
Kyu
Is 13 credits a lot to get for one semester?
07that's fairly low o3o
:<
07it's 1 above minimum o3o
:<
But...
She said that's a full course
07at least it is for my school
And supposedly if I want more, I have to get approval
:<
/me turns
._.
well...
I'll see if I can get more then
07you don't have to if your advisor says that's full o3o
I don't wanna screw around in college
It's my one chance to get out of this hell-hole
hey
I hate this shift.... I'm glad I only do it twice a year.
so lonely
03heh
03yeah, 12 credits is the minimum here too
03and 18 is the max
03though I've had 13 both semesters
:<
12wow twice a year
/me puts kipi in his favorite spot again

Or did he take a bite and die?
03that's Flash
03as in
03APple killed him
03:P
o-o
So apple makes things slow or apple ruins flash?
Or both? o.o
03both.
lol
Rah!!!
So... whats your opinion on having classes every day?
Bad? XP
03no
03I've always had classes every day
12lol
Some days are only one class though and my cousin was saying, "man, trust me. you're going to hate it and you're going to start thinking, ' why am I coming for only one class today'".
03that's why you live on campus
But I don't live on campus
It's a community college.
/me smiles and nuzzles against

its movie talk :p
5And... Chat is majorly lagging.

5I know.
Altair: perfect movie for ape lovers?
RP4L same :|
/me gives Sneas a taco
though I wonder why they still want to make a pirates of the carribean movie again
5But I've been posting on a couple of threads there and I'm worried I might get myself into trouble. But I digress! Altair, King Kong was a great movie. xD
5They should stop after POTC3. >< Seriously.
I didn't like it D:

o hai
xD
*greatly
i love what my normal team does to normal attackers
i use dusknoir
lol Dusknoir
will-o-wisp them and burn them, half their attack
trick room fff
then switch with salamence and intimidate them
lowering their attack even more
and I keep forgetting about will-o-wisp's secondary effect
I didn't know about the attack halve thing
will o wisp has no secondary effect
plain burn just halves attack
if my opponent uses a special attacker i either try to take it out
or start setting up with suicune
that is really the point of my team
to setup suicune
it can handle special sweepers and physical sweepers i tear away at with dusknoir and salamence
/me glomps back :D
and lol Suicune
!digimon !type
dude, SoulSilver is beast!

hey
apperently someone is trying to involve me in a scam...
o.o
what kind of scam?
i just got a call from someone trying to offer me a job for 14 dollars an hour...
O_O
What's the job?
have no idea
Hmm, that a lot?
almost twice what i get now
hmm
Hah, nice.
probably someone trying to scam me cause no one calls random people and asks them if they would take a job in this day and age
especially not a job that pays that much
I've gotten job offers in the mail before
Telemarketing though
I'd never do that
what gets me is that someone knew enough about me to call me instead of my dad
cause im not listed in the directory
5Hi!
Huh, that is suspicious
Maybe Walmart sold your address
doubt it
!readquote 19

Vector isn't a scam actually
03why thank you
i just looked them up
I have a friend who worked for them
12santa looks weird without a beard
don't do it though
lol
it's sales
dawwww, look at my wittle totodile :D|
and you only make money for each sale
they said it wasnt telemarketing or door to door
but i know how that is
Well, not really
you only sell stuff to people you know
03ew.
ah
and then they recommend you to other people
in the end, you'll rarely ever even make sales
Why don't I have my kicking boots on?
so therefore you'll rarely make any money
Oh good point, I don't need them to kick.
they said i would get 14 something at a flat rate though....
got news, your gonna need bigger boot -_o
not though commissions
i dunno i dont need a second job anyway
Please use proper grammar. Your current state is unacceptable.
Hmm
unacceptable! unacceptable! Absoulutley Unacceptable!!
lol so whats up
yeah

03And I dunno if I should put Linux Mint or Debian on it
i can see a knife costing around 200

03Because I want another linux distro on it
Linux redhat yay

Mint is easy but I hate it
:(
so I fyou need help give us a shout :P

I remember he offered to buy me [censored] all the time
I always said no though lol
infa z yeah I remember a couple years ago he was talking about trying to get 1mil before he was 18
lol what would your mom say if you all of the sudden got a laptop in the mail
/j #4chan
hmm
o.o
no wonder he has such expensive software then
Yeah, he's a professional PHP developer
greece is pretty much dead
poor greeks, they had a good fight but couldnt stand agaisnt me :p
He's been doing stuff like that for money since he was like 13 or 14 I think
ok so i keep missing things... i'm gonna go now
hmm
yeah he made spyroforum when he was 12
whats php anyway?
Things!
03o.o
03Bye Alt :<
coding
ah
understands*
I don't know too much about it, but I've made forms with it before
03yanaond.
Like checkboxes, text fields, stuff like that
PHP processes them and sends the information to another page
PHP is used on most sites now.
I knwo it does more, but I'm not experienced enough to know exactly what
Because it is regarded as one of the easiest languages to learn.
My Java teacher hates php
He says it gives you so much rope that you can hang yourself with it
I don't really get what he means.
It gives you too much freedom
So you don't learn proper techniques
12FEATHER! :o
12hai
10LL!
10hai :D
12XD
10lol
Lol, he just doesn't like that what he knows is becoming outdated.
PHP is a very effective and simple language to use
Being able to use a language for anythng and everything is great.
10Feather, Pokewalkercheat failed to listen to you once again
He'd kill you for saying that
:P
It means you don't end up having to learn many different languages.
cause he's stuck teaching something that he knows is surpassed by PHP :P
he's just jealous
this kid in my class would always talk about PHP
10-_-
and he'd basicallly tell him to stfu
"Shut up Owen, we're not talking about PHP right now"

You don't know me IRL though, so you can't make any real comment about me, so anything you say about me I don't take seriously. :P
Interesting perspective
though despite the fact that you are on the internet, you are still the same person
I think I'm pretty much the same online as in real life, just a little more outgoing online
Whatever, either way, I just don't care.
I try to be the same on and offline
So you can't insult just my online self or real life self

What days do you work again?
thrs-sunday
Ah
I'm hoping for Sunday-Thursday
then I'd pretty much have the weekend off
but omg not doing anything during the week is the best because it's not crowded anywhere
no
he's not coming back anyways :P I seriously think that it wasn't the real user
What did he do that was "rude"?
The post looks fine to me
I think it was an older brother [censored]ing [censored] up on their little sibling's accounts
yeah coz I edit it
Ah
What did it say?
previous it said that they were "lazy as fucck" and to "get to it puussyfaces"
Lol wow
mhmm
like I said I don't think it was the real user
I'm wondering if I should ban
His location and sig are completely inappropriate
the funny part is how huge his list is
and then you have a single rule
There are no reported posts
Once you delete the post, the report that was tied to it goes away
I know.
But I fixed that poll one
link?
and the swears in the one
What's the poll one?
and when I went to get them off the reported posts menu it told me I was "not authorized"
http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-11109-who-belive-ripto-is-a-[censored].html
someone just reported it because it was in the wrong spot
censored link
so I moved it to polls
the link says l o s e r
/me eyerolls
XD http://www.spyroforum.com/post-324247.html#324247
Doesn't matter though if there's no report though
it was there you must have deleted it
OK, I just set his account to "inactive"
that or SR did
As good as I can get to deletion
I haven't deleted anything for wekes

Worth a suggestion :/

12wow...I just had a random moment o3o
12If Link and Yoshi were walking down a road together, they would need an escape plan, two giant umbrellas, an emergency shield, a riot control person, bodyguards taking up at least 2 streets ahead and behind them AND chocolate to even HOPE of keeping this Lati away ;o

Merging drives to the point that the OS runs off the internal memory while everything else runs off the disk.

Why does she always have to leave when her mom comes home?
Never got that
10Yum, hot chocolate
i dunno
maybe to hide us from her
12lolz
12chocolatechocolatechocolate
/me spazzes
10Spongebob reference: CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE!
I wonder why some posts from yesterday are marked as read when I haven't been on the forum since last week
12lolz
Chocolate? Did you just say... Chocolate?
I think it's because her mom takes her to concerts
so she's excited to leave
maybe its your dad using your name
10Yes, we're selling chocolates, sir
:P
12brb
Better not be
Hmm
12I read that as stealing o3o
that's weird
Could he even do that?
My mom's already spied on my Gmail account once
Chocolate? Chocolate?! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAAATE!!!!!
/me steals a balloon

another reference
But I can kind of understand that because she was worried
http://site.palemale.com/31may2010-2176
03eactly :P
03*exactly
10as done so in the episode
yeah this would defeat your dad's purpose of even blocking the site
There's nothing to worry about here, and I don't see why he'd go on SF if he thought it would give him viruses
You have over-protective parents.
I know
03the best episode of SpongeBob ever is Band Geeks
03just saying.
But this time, my dad's actually just worried about viruses getting on the household computers
03o/` the winner take all, it's the thrill of one more kill o/`
Nothing to do with me at all
03David Glen Eisley FTW?
LOL my mother loves that one

14Anyway I need to get downloading like a bitch (only gots an hour till peak times kick in >:( )
04B|
04peak times?
02lol
14Basically when the internet is used more
02pwned a whole team with Lucario
02download Pokemon Online
02So we can battle :D
14And play it on what?
02Meaning?
02download teh client ;o
14I swear everyone purposely forgets that I don't have a decent comp
02It doesn't take too much
1464MB RAM remember
then you should prioritize other things
14This comp lags enough without some game doing more :<
trust me
02takes up 90mb
0219mb*
02of memory
let him choose himself silly
02on my laptop
02I'm just asking him lol
02not forcing
14Yeh this has about 5MB free XD
02XD
14If my laptop was hooked up to the net then fine
14But I need to get a PCI Ethernet Card before it gets net
14Or wireless
14Either one
02o.o
14ffff my ISP keeps blocking BT Ports >>
02:|
02I hate sore losers
02who go 'fuck you' when they lose
sore losers, duh
02it's annoying
i dunno what i hate the most, sore losers going like "FUK U" or sore winners going like "git gud scrub"
probably perfectly equal, taking games that serious makes you a gigantic throbbing dick in the eye of decent people
14Wow how fucking stingy does my ISP wanna be -v-
._.
14I've got 0.3% of a 58.4mb Torrent left to download >>
02o.o
02[20:16:20] <~Espeon> i dunno what i hate the most, sore losers going like "FUK U" or sore winners going like "git gud scrub"
02[20:16:35] <~Espeon> probably perfectly equal, taking games that serious makes you a gigantic throbbing dick in the eye of decent people
02I agree
02I always go 'gg' no matter what
02if I remember correctly
02"It's not the winning or losing that matters...it's how much fun you had that matters."
well people playing games need to learn that
02^
02Also lol
04^
too many people are like OVER 9000 GB RANK GIT GUD RANDOMNAHSuAHSIUAHSA
04ohnoes I lost
02I like having psychic on Lucario
04my life is over
02lol rank doesn't matter tbqh
04you sick fucker made me lose
04you're an asshole
04[/etc]
i mean, i don't say GG if someone outright cheats. and no, not like "using an overpowered weapon" but like pulls the cord to avoid a recorded loss or hacks
otherwise i don't give a fuck :D
14lol
02[20:21:00] <~Espeon> i mean, i don't say GG if someone outright cheats. and no, not like "using an overpowered weapon" but like pulls the cord to avoid a recorded loss or hacks
02I hate other people using legends/ubers
02But I usually say gg anyway
02unless they actually CHEAT
^v^
14ra
dsfopfsd
Silly irc clients
well if it's in uber tier you don't have a single word to say anyway, and i thought the tier things on pokeyman online restricted ubers but well
be it ubers or oma grenade launchers - it's a part of the game
02I stay on OverUse
02d
02people use ubers on overused as well
in fact, pulling the cord to keep your 1337 win/loss ratio is almost sadder than cheating imo
Die
02o_O
x.x there
02pulling the cord?
well say if you play on ps3
and you're losing
02lolwut
Fleef lol
you pull the ethernet/disconnect the router to force a "disconnect" - usually not recording as a loss
so yeah, that way you can theoretically get a 9001 W/L ratio
14I'm meh, you?
but those people usually suck so xD
02Actually
Same
02Pokemon online rates that as an automatic loss
02I think
02Want to try?
I
I'm dandy*
02I know onlinechess gives your opponent a chance to reconnect
02otherwise they automatically lose after a minute
02I had an opponent who spammed me with messages and move take backs etc.
02because they were losing
02pretty badly
02then they tried to disconnect
lol
02so all in all, they lost
02^^
well most games nowadays either keep a disconnect %
and i always chuckle when I see like "2343 wins, 2 losses, 72% disconnect"
meh, w/l, KDR, cheap and fair - it's all a game
play to have fun - and if you have fun by doing your best then do so but respect those who just dick around
tl;dr^
04lol
04you know what would be realle sad?
hm
04if someone put there losing quote in Pokemon Online to "YOU SUCK FAGGOT"
i bet someone has some hilarious tryhard quotes there
04lol
02I've seen some people like that
02I go on the beta server which is the largest one
i've had someone conclude my sexual orientation out from my kill/death ratio in a shooting game before. I still fail to see the link between that and being gay/straight
/facepalm
04wat
"Basement cleaner +100 xp"
lolwut
04wat
if anyone with the username Josef Fritzl was there, i would laugh to death twice
14<~Espeon> meh, w/l, KDR, cheap and fair - it's all a game <<<< Try telling that to the pricks on Combat Arms XD
LOL
hi
14he
14hey*
14That's kinda why I stopped playing Combat Arms altogether
hehe
14That and the amount of hackers on it
02lol crackers
i played it like a week and once I couldn't play in the beginner lobby anymore
shit talking and hackers EVERYWHERE
14Yeh
14Mind you, you have hackers in the beginner lounge as well
14Oh well, I don't really care
14XXD
14XD*
14I'll stick to my PS2
really my own teammates told me to "die irl" and all that e-thug shit because according to them i made them lose, even though they placed under me in the leaderboard. And I know, and a LOT of alternate characters just trying to garden their KDR and look so pra0
but heh, i'll stick to other gaems
xD
14xD
14My KDR was shitty on CA
140.5 or something XD
140.473 to be exact LOL
/me now compares that KDR to his KDR on 007 nightfire
/me SHOT
LOL
02o.o
that game is so epic in multiplayer. really, all the old james bond ones are xD
14lol my KDR on Nightfire is like 100.3
14Bots = stupid 8D
yeah
even on fastest reaction and max health
14Yep
14I have everything on max with bots now
xD
14Still too easy XD
14Might risk going in with 5% health

i thought it was possible for you to get a new computer monitor yesterday
something about a relative barrowing a car
I said not till saturday :/
12Hey everyone!
heh i see
then again, still no guarantees.
/me changes normal mIRC text color so he can read it without highlighting....
Lol.

rm?
http://www.youtube.com/user/mentallyunstablepc#p/f/11/Q77sJT8O56E
also*
you can always look in the newspapers Quilava XD
what about them?
to see if there is anyone who is holding a garage sale and is selling a computer monitor
eh, I doubt it, not in this weather
it has been for the past two days
heh
just got nothing to do for a while.
/me yawns..
hi
Hey Arti :3

/me crosses fingers
(you have seen the news, yes?)

some taxi driver decided to shoot some people downtown and then shoot some other people further away
come on then
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/10214661.stm
of course, now we have condescending reporters (we were never flooded, so we didn't have them during the floods) coming to town
you don't realise how much a pack of liars news agencies are until they tell stories about where you live
anyway, bbl
dinner
friggin slow internet
12lol
Depending on the news agencies
Sometimes they are just plain lazy and don't bother with research
brb
bac.
what a fnahdhing bastard
I don't believe that...
I wonder if the gunman is actually from whitehaven, wouldn't surprise me
how can someone just do that in a peaceful area like that?!
Sick and twisted is what that is :|
/me wbs
I better tell Xai..
God only knows what kind of anger and hatred clouded his mind to make him do that
thanks.
np
I wanna do something..

I'll give you all the change I find on the way to the post office.

I just can't believe it
but people i know who know people know somebody who died
/me shrug
yeah I know about it arti, I thought you didnt hear about it for a moment
I've been watching it all day really
the local news warned people in the NE to be vigilant too in case the gunman fled towards east...
6Indeed
right before we took Lugia on a trip there as well
I thought hekilled himself.
well he did
I erm
he did this was before they found him
saw some of the stuff they had chasing him
ah
and yeah that came to my head as well the fact Lugia was coming
they had helicopters with people poking giant machineguns out of following him around!
:/
ovo;;;;;
cool lol
yeah
and they couldn't even catch him
~_~
british police for you...
lol
yep!
14Agreed
wait, were they following him even when he was peppering people with bullets?
erm, I think the police probably did a very good job
03Azure :3
Sneas :3
the focus was keeping him away from people, which they eventually succeeded with
Ohai Sneas and Azure :3

12:P
5LOL!
wow
ouch
5...
just what I thought
good to know people from the states reassuring not all of them are like this stereotype ;)
5Yeah... only the ones on TV are like the stereotype 95% of the time.
That's strange, people in a channel called #furry, also in a channel called #4chan, lol.
5Just keep that in mind.
5Believe me, I know. I live here.
lol
12Wat
XD
lolwut*
12?
maybe that's why you're not ENTIRELY neutral in your point of view. Nor would anyone be in your situation
that's what you're supposed to say lolage
5That's true.
and may I recommend just ONE thing for the start?
5I'm not entirely neutral at all.
5Yeah, sure.
5Shoot.
reduce patriotism and all this religious stuff to a normal level ;)
lol
/me can't think of anything to draw.
12xD
:P
12X3
well, one nation was full of patriotism
this patriotism lead this nation into the second world war, ruining the nation and spitting it into half for more than five decades
5And if you'll look around the internet you'll see "patriotism" has dropped exponentially since WWII.
lol
lolage
yeah
5Actually
5the Cold War kind of did that.
this sums up the truth, it's just the "cool thing to do" to hate on furries appearently
5WWII brought the country together.
XD
12Yes, indeed.
err...not really to be entirely honest
except it cause the allied forces to invade it and stuff
5(In a sense, anyways.)
caused*
5Invade what?
03draw me :3

Germany.
03Practiceeeeeee :3
03XD
12I prefer humans, though XD
12XD
5...Now I'm lost on what you're referring to.
always keep in mind: A high amount of religious beliefs and patriotism leads to fanatism - and that leads to war, the one way or another
kewl lol
03Draw me as a human :3
/me hides
Exactly.
03http://www.humor-articles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/woman_exam_answer.jpg <-- ROFL
5How can you really say that about religion though?
seen it
12XD
because that's what a high level of religion always does
5Yeah, saw it too, DRF.
03that's my favorite so far
Most of the time, religions believe that they are self-righteous and other religions are false
it always did and will always do
5./Always?/
12Stupid artblockage is catching up with me .
12XD
yeah
5See, there's a huge difference between "always" and "most of the time".
12Brb in 5
12chore crap
12alreadyX
12XD
yarly :V
in the early ages it were the Pharaohs and the people all around fighting wars and slaughtering for "THEIR GOD"
later it were the holy crusades
5So the argument you're making is that if there were no religion, their would be very few wars.
03http://www.humor-articles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hard_water_answer.jpg <-- that was on failblog
7yeah?
that's where a too high amount of religion always leads you to
03D:
non-fanatic religion is good
Btw religion isn't always the cause of war, it's just the excuse that's used.
There real reason is probably for land or resources, etc.
5Hate the ones who /twist/ the religion, not the religion itself.
You know you're surrounded by furries when someone asks "What're you?" and the response "Human" creates an awkward silence. :o
religion is used for justification, and the people that are fanatics believe it
5Exactly, Leviathan.
well, the problem with religion is: Once the people are too deep within it, they can become instruments of the priests or their equivalents
5Only if the leaders of the religion are corrupt.
Religion at its core is good; using religion to be belligerant is bad
5Exactly! (I feel like a broken record.)
and how do you call the actions of Bush then?
he also invaded Iraq "for god's sake"
7... elaborate
5I call them shortsighted and biased.
7ah
Bad use of religion, the pope telling people in Africa not to use condoms. :o
5He was /not/ fit to be president AT ALL, in my opinion.
7actually, wait. what?
12Bacl
12*k
12:D
What do you mean?
well, this religious background was the reason Bush was elected in fact
wb
5Not entirely.
7was this in any sort of context or is it just a re-hashing of an old xkcd joke?
5It was post-Clinton administration.
12Ty
No I made it up from something that just happened to me on another server.
5He was a Republican and son of a former president. People thought he'd be a good change.
many overly-religious people chose Bush because they feared his rival would be unable to protect them. Because the rival was not believing deeply enough in god
People get tired of one administration, they elect a different one
12C:
5That.
7I seez.
Yes, but that's true of any political battle
07well overly religious people are hardly the majority
5That's how every president has gotten elected here. (More or less.)
party lines cause people to vote only for one party
so religion is part of a political battle
5@Kyu :: They're a very loud bunch though. xD
03why the frick are we discussing religion
we're getting closer to connect religion to war ;)
/me will come back later when there's something more fun to talk about o.o
I never did get to finish that argument about logic...
DRF, because of... of... Nazi Germany?
07because TS doesn't mind breaking the rules XP
But I was definitely right.
03Nazi Germany? Pssh, it has nothing on Soviet Russia
/me runs
Stereotypes, looks like
just to put in front of your eyes how any tool of good, any medication, can become a deadly and dangerous weapon, an instrument to move into the entire wrong direction
about patriotism
5Yeah.
5I'm not denying that, TS.
/me is bored.
boredom KEELZ
That's not only true of religion, though
12Indeed it does D:
5It's true of everything.
lol
5Everything can be manipulated to one's own selfish purposes.
12x3
/me wonders how many times he'll get cussed out at work today
12o.O?
03They switched us over to prepay only before you pump a week ago and people are still mad about it xD
oh boy...
12xDD Wow
03(work at gas station so lulz)
12yus
12X3
03I'll still be on here though but I dunno if I will talk alot
12Okay D:
5Well, I gotta run. It was a good debate. If ya ever wanna chat, TS, just drop me a PM or whatever. Bye all!
How do you pay before you put the petrol in, how can you know how much you're going to use?
and that's why I ask to not be overly religious
03bye
03They have to give a certain amount and if they don't pump it all we give their change back
Oh, seems a bit of an awkward system. :o
to make this end: It's not bad being religious. Just keep your eyes open for possible manipulations and don't follow blindly what someone might say, just because many do so. Use your head, follow your inner voice and your heart instead
12Yeah.
03It is, but people will get used to it I hope xD
12x3
Hopefully. XD

do you like folksy music at all
from time to time
like Bob Dylan type of music?
never heard his music
Dylan's great
he's from the 60s I believe
....eh
a lot of modern bands do covers of his music though
Cya later
yeah I'm not a huge fan of that era the only thing from the 60's that I've probably ever heard and actually liked is like beach music
:P
oh hey!
Won't be long
lol Bob Dylan is definitely not beach music
:P
hey Infamous
my point
:P
I like folksy bands without the southern accent
Ah, yeah

/me taunts

family guy is awesome
Ah, Family Guy reference
Hi lol
don't watch it so I didn't know
i watch it cause its one of the only worthwhile things on tv
Lol, the only actual TV show I watch is X-Play
most of the time my tv is just background noise
they review video games
i wish i could get that channel again
I hate the kids that are like totally obsessed with FG though and like hulu is their fav site etc
i use to watch g4 all the time until it started going the way of crap
X-Play's the only good show they have left
and it's even getting ruined
Haha, that's a cool name for a TV show
"untitled rock show"
cartoon network is going to crap as well
infa z omg I know right not only do they have [censored]ty cartoons now but half the [censored] isn't even cartoon anymore
yeah...
lol banner... thumbs up to melons
hahahahahaah
kids and their [censored] downloads
I have 200+ hard copy cds
lets see them show off their "music collection" now
my neice likes to have hard copies too
I just like having legal copies lol
but I don't listen to music much
lol
I have almost 10k listens on lfm
:D
I don't collect things for value, but I have a few movie trilogy sets
but only because I like the movies
I only finally got my ipod scrobbler to work so hopefully it'll work better soon
if I didn't watch them much I wouldn't buy it
can ipods communicate with Last.fm somehow?
yeah once you set it up properly
most of the time i dont even buy movies and such as, if i have watched them, the second time is bogged down so much, and the third time is just boring
whats last.fm?
I don't know if it's because I'm crazy, but I could watch a movie a million times if I like it enough
like Pandora
ah
i use slacker
so I finally found a copy feature
to drag my old library onto this computer
and now it works
:D
ha... your 20 my ass
hahahhaah
hmm... looking at your pic.. makes me wonder what broke my bro from hoodies..

12LOL
an
*ah
MBAM is good.
it had to do with a tool bar so i dont know if it was all that malicious
Hello's peoples.
Hiya
07you know
07you should just remove the smilies because they suck XD
Norton is crap.
still sucks though
Screwed up my computer.
We used to have Norton
hmm
A virus killed my Norton, then my internet wouldn't work.
My dad got rid of it because it sucked
i actually prefer plain old text emotes o.o
14<~Articuno> He's an AOL user <~Articuno> What do you expect <<<< Alot of fail
12LOL
14Altair same :>
Eventually I fixed it by downloading their tool to remove ALL Norton prodcuts.
omfg AOL still EXISTS?
products*
whats a good brand of anti virus and firewall
14Nick yeh XD
07considering i'm fixing yet another one of his fails lol
12Kyu yeh, I should XD but I used to have Lugia and Articuno smilies, I might put those back
after all its incesent advertising and fail browsers?!
Hehe, AOL... I think they /still/ use a pair of KL-10 miniframes from DEC. :P
I don't bother, but AVG is supposed to be good.
14LOL
12and spam CD post..
i at least want a firewall
It's free btw.
oh yeah all the old ISP's did that
i've heard zone alarm is awesome and free
AOL was the best... in 1995
the firewall
Wanadoo as well
14Yeh 15 years ago LOL
I like the AOL CDs... they make perfect coasters. And desk-unwobblers. And frisbees... :P
My first wireless router was Wanadoo
Firewalls just interfere with my programs and I'd disable it 5 minutes later.
LOL I have a ton of AOL CDs
i've had avg or something similar on cnet and it was slow as hell
14AOL CD's = Good frisbees
they still sent them to us when we had their service
Our family computer has AVG now
i mostly surf and graphics edit so its not that big of a deal with me
I just threw out the CD and kept the cases XD
Is Avast any good?
14xD
I think it works well because we've never had any serious problems
14Sounds logical :P
avast was what i had
that's what our family PC has
ok then
Like, worse than Norton

Your sex is only 3 minutes and 55 seconds long? Wow, that's quick. :o

Yeah, I know, and hey
First time loading up GIMP took about 30 minutes for me (may be an exaggeration, can't remember well).
mine just took almost exactly a minute
5 hour difference I believe
maybe it has to do with Vista
:P
Because it got to "loading texts" and that took aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages.
before or after?
1400 GMT
XP, 1GB RAM, 124 GB hard drive
^

hey Icy
Hi Nick. ^^
/me hugs Arti, Kyu, and Nick with her 9 tails
12I ought to go you know ^^ but I'll be on tomorrow, Friday and the weekend but only in the evenings
Hmm... I appear to be out of bottled water... this is quite annoying.
12Use a tap XD
My only available choices are... beer and light beer. This is both annoying. And awesome. :P
2o3o
2lol awesome beer
/me 2rofls
/me is tail hugged
/me is bored.
12Tail hugs hmm
12Sounds fun
/me goes to wrap tail round Xai
2.....
(The tap water is... wholly blech... as it has overtones of chlorine, flourine and mild amounts of rust from the annoying-sink-I-need-to-replace.
2LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
12Well, I wish I could for real XD
2THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS SOMEWHAT LIKE HIBARI
12I rreaaaaalllly should go XD
2nw if only I had a tie o3o
b4 you go arti...
Night...(does a Stewie Giggle Laugh and runs away)
hmm...
OMFG ROFL!!! XDDDD
XD
Huh... I have a record of a tune by "Josef Franz Wagner"... who is this Wagner whom I've never heard of before...
who is this Wagner you speak of? XD
12Ra?
12Why did you do that at me? lol
me?
12Yes lol
Arti, I'm wearing a necklace with a fox face for the pendant. ^^
12Aww
I was deliberetly trying to keep you up lol :P
J.F. Wagner... apparently composed "Unter dem Doppeladler" (English: "Under the Double Eagle"), neat this record is from Germany... cool.
guess you never saw the family guy ep where stewie keeps pestering lois, she replies angrily and stewie says "...hi" and runs away?
07lol
2wouldn't a double eagle be the New Roman Empire? O:
2or Prussia?
2wait Prussia is only a single black eagle
2never mind
2^^;
The double eagle is Austrian... so then J.F. Wagner must be Austrian, or liked Austria.
2XD
And the piece... sounds somewhat nice... it's apparently a march.
2well Austria 2is2 Germanic
2o3o
2.... lol timing
But it also sounds vaguely like a polka.
thought I PINGedas
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chH7wMoFm9s <-- And it's on YouTube... like every piece of music in existence...
(Hilariously useless aside... the music is good accompaniment for my current beverage. Hehe.)
12Before I switch off for the night
12WHAT IS THE POINT IN CRESSELIA!?!?
12WHAT GAME IS IT FROM? HOW DO YOU GET IT? WHAT IS IT? WHY IS THERE NO INFORMATION ABOUT IT?
12Night!
07lolwut
Huh... I think whomever made this record was trying to be funny, because one side is J.F. Wagner's "Unter dem Doppeladler" and the other side is that piece everyone has heard written by Richard Wagner. :P
there actually is a story about Cresselia and Darkrai
2smooooch lol
D: but allies are so... allyie
/me is shot
well they did nuke me o3o
true
/me says "finish them >:D"
Now, I just have to make sure they dont do the "operation knife" again
So Europe has been steamroller'd Brother? Have you applied awesome music yet? :P
No
if only XD
its still the first month of war
but I have been at an advantage
I re did it when I failed at my strategy early november
giving the allies the chance to invade east germany
so..i re did it and now its all changed XD
gained 3 territories quickly, munich is almost mine
o.o
and..the DDR exists now o3o
Finland is on my side, and Mexico is still deciding
got them to have a revolution :D
Hehe
http://www.energyfiend.com/death-by-caffeine
only problem is I doubled my bombing raids on western europe
tripple on Nationalist spain
Don't take over Munich though! They have the awesome that is Oktoberfest! :P
though it isnt really an 'allied nation'
but the DDR needs it :P
w/ game is that
!mate
.
HoI is good
Played the third?
No
shiny shiny new stuff
I'm tempted to either download Arsenal of Democracy
or HoI3
if you like HoI2, you probably can't go wrong with HoI3
but the doomsday campaign is bascially the epic yet hard campaign of the whole
ic
since, if you suck at grand scale games
you'll loose this in..a matter of days
since the allies have to get through the red zone of germany
then poland
and then a looong climb to Moscow
hardest front I say is central europe and the turkish regions
/me yawn
I don't play it often, but I enjoy trying to be as weird as possible.
for the game, that isnt hard
yeah p:
Tibet ruling the world as an example :p
has that happened on HoI III?
I do not know
I need to update HOIDDA to play as more nations
I thought the third one was quite realistic, it was hard to do much as any of the smaller nations
HOI3 has 'said' that you can play as any nation
anyway, bed for me
Playing as Tibet in HOI2 is evil so... HOI2 is somewhat nicely balanced...
bye o//
the british really must like the middle east in this game
However... it is /hilarious/ when they get any sort of military (good bye Afghanistan).
they defend it more than their own isles
afghanistan has..what 13 units max for most the game?
hello again
hey
Yeah... same with... what is it, Nepal?
What's up?
No, less so
not much
4 units max
you?
even in war time
Also... the biggest "battle" I had as Tibet... was invading China.
which one?
/me hides
All of them. :P
since the game has like 3-5 chinas
XD
A whole lot of nothing....
in my doomsday campaign
(Except the PRC... which became an ally... for some strange reason.)
the CC one is going to roll over all of them
(And whom I promptly encircled... and crushed.)
yello
did he say anything?
nope
its ironic, i can't reach japan
I surrounded it but no transport boats
lol
my one weakness really
again?
XD
Haha.
Isn't is !mateplz, or something?
Well that worked.
My most difficult battles as Tibet were the "Chinese Campaign(s)", the "To Moscow!" campaign, "Eclipsing the Rising Sun" campaign, and finally "To the Isles!"
(Yes, I give all my missions names. :P )
("To Moscow!" can also sort be named... "The Inverse Mongol Rally" as basically the entire "campaign" was busting into Mongolia, with a /tiny/ bit of warlord Chinese buffereing the USSR... and then slowly advancing while driving a wedge between the Soviet forces.)
o.o
thanks ;o
o.o
I have several' missions' then and even name enemy missions :p
I have the "through Berlin, Across the Rehim!" Campaighn
the "balkan liberation" campaign
o.o
then I completed the "The fall of occupation in South K." campaign
D:
and have a "through the ice and snow, To Olso we go!"
Joy killed her
Getting into Berlin was entertaining...
and a final one called "operation, death of the boot nation" :p
Basically I steamrollered the USSR (who were up to the middle of Polad... whereupon they kind of... folded once I had Moscow... and I made peace with the Germans.
I then "moved in" to Finland, Sweden and Denmark...
Whereupon... Germany had a bad day... :P
All of the USSR?
They basically folded because I got all the "capitals" of it... so they just... gave up.
I let them keep this one piece of annoyance in the middle of Siberia though. :P
XD
but bascially my operation is to cut the top half of Italy from the rest of Europe
(think of taking the whole 'pure' leg from the rest of the infection)
then finish with it
I just *blam*ed Germany... and "helped" Italy, Greece, France, and Turkey.
my plan will bascially cut from the eastern border of Italy(near yugoslavia)
and then cut through the rest of france
and invade Spain

though the turkey campaign will be difficult
g'night everyone
since I'm invading from the Caucasians and from instanpoul
I basically ignored Europe after I got Germany, Austria, northern Italy and most of the med.
well I can :p
*can't
(I also made sure to get NAPs with the UK, France, and Spain.)
since most of it is at war with me
save Sweden, Portugal, and ireland
Then I proceeded with... "Eclipsing the Rising Sun" which the US was mildly happy with.
heh after turkey there are 2 final missions for me :P
12OMG!
12LIKE:
"The fields for the People, the oil for the people's armies!"
12OMG!
and "ending colonization..once and for al"
By this time... I decided to go to all out war with the remaining Continental European countries... starting with Italy.

have to leave the computer instantly because they're home
Sometimes when I was banned I'd use the computer in the family room when my parents were gone, then I'd hear the garage door and run into the bathroom or my room
lol id do the same thing
did I ever tell you about the times when I was little and got banned from my Gamecube?
I did the same thing
id always run to the front window and look if someone was comming
they caught me a few times too
Hahaha, yeah me too
every little noise would make me look out the window
;o
I'd have never risked that for just playing some video game
i would
got nothing else to do
/me is nao Camera Shy o3o
eh, I wasn't really risking much
and I was bored as hell
course by the time i was 13 i had free raign on my vidogames
*reign
I didn't have free reign on anything until college
i played halo on the computer non stop from the time i got home from school to when i would go to sleep

Internet's down
Awww
I forgot
/me pokes internet
LL
I know how to stop it
dude... someone has a lotta legos
You need to turn autojoin off, create a script that autoidentifies and joins you to channels depending on the network name
and time
it would guess this was cg created
Nah, he says that he spent 1500 hours photographing
it's stop motion I think
12o3o
12is THAT all?
/me hides
yeah xD
12brb
12brb
It should work on every site
You just don't always get the full functionality when scripts are involved
Ah
like with GPX+
Facebook chat doesn't work for example
And that
would that youtube video work through it?
no idea
what gets me is how he can smoothly do the rotating camera with the stop motion thing
:3
:D
It's pretty crazy what the guy does
is it something I shold care about?
:D
well its awesome in its on feat but you dont NEED to see it
Well, I guess not, but it's really cool
youtube videos don't work
oh okay
/me needs to find a better proxy
it's this video where a guy just kept reassembling legos to make all kinds of different animations
it was freakin awesome the way he did it
but it's all in tune to an 8-bit song he wrote
and the song is kind of catchy
it was sorta weird how he did the pong with teh background waveing like that
yeah, that must have taken a while
huh... i didn't know that youtube handled 1080p
oh wow
I don't know how they even could
unless somebody used youtube on a huge TV
some laptops are hd rated
up to 1080p
hot to have a display and graphics card to match i think though
*got
must be like looking out a window on a laptop screen
I bet they're expensive too
nope
its standard anymore
k
k, I'm going to bed
night
dont let teh walmart get you in your sleep

That's the benefit of working nights I suppose
03o.o

Oh true
thats where it has me
"I have nightmares of Walmart"
lol
ive had nightmares at walmart
fell asleep in the break room
XD

I bet that'll happen to me sooner or later
just try to keep to your sleep schedual
thats something id stress to you..
You mean the one I have now?
I've pulled several 24+ hour sessions working at walmart
when you work nightshift
10-7

they are freakin retarded...

Ugh, that'll be fun

03SIGH

I just had mildly infuriating router troubles a moment ago
03it wasn't my router
03it was my PCI WI-Fi card
03it randomly just disabled itself
and dont expect a whole lot of training cause i got by by the kindness of the other employees
that's what I hear as well
same problem, different source
they basically let the supervisor tell me a few basic tihngs and threw me in
i was lucky that i was partnered with a guy that knew what he was doing
Hahaha
I hope whoever I get partnered with does
whenever I'm at my local walmart at night everybody looks half dead
chaz.. sweep this aile (half hour later) sweep the next one

youll be whatever life there is at nightshift for about a week and then... you will be come one of us...
but it isn't short for anything
"One of us"
XD
A zombie!

It is
lol
mystery of the night shift zombies lol
what's been up while I've been gone?
I'm gonna say "Zoinks!" and "Jinkies!" to all my coworkers now
or youll be like teh new sweeper at my walmart and be mexican and emo and wont talk to anyone
i was like... wtf.. that doesnt even mix
XD
emo Mexican... hmmm
sounds very untraditional
way i could tell was because of the freakin huge bang
ah yeah
in front of his eyes
then he had it cut
yeah
I had that before my haircut, but it was long everywhere else too so it was more of a shag
my brother is more of a bunch of shag

03:O
12lolz

12if you want to see weird, you should ask me about writing a FF involving Link :O
/me HIDES
03because everybody pronounces my last name wrong >:|
03it SHOULD have a é at the end
12but but but
I was just advised to go buy money
03so I always use accents when they're required XD
:0
12Ganondrf
03what
that happened to someone in my clas
*class
03heh
12HOW can you mispronounce Fail?
03teachers always said it wrong
and their name has an accent in it.
03that when they said it right
03I was like :O
but it's the first name
XD
03oh.
03well
12Danny's Real Fail o3o
03my mom thinks our last name had an accent
/me shot again
5It takes place on the PokÃ©mon world, but it's 2163, so it's like Star Trek: Enterprise era, but I also involve Q, who is from "The Next Generation" and "Voyager", and AUUGH it's strange. xD
03but that it got dropped in customs
03everyone pronounces Forche like "forsch"
03it's TOTALLY NOT THAT
03just make the e a é and that's how :P
03so yeah
5And to top it all off

03but it's fun recording movies off TV, especially those with lots of swearing
03because they edit the language

03and sometimes it's funny

03but you wanna know something awesome
03I was using GameCube AR, right
12Young Link vs. Bongo-Bongo XD
haha
03used a code for super Mario Sunshine
03infinite jump

5xD
03*hour
12and you don't get down XD
03until I reached an invisible ceiling
/me has seen that drf
03about 10 miles above
03and then I let go
03and FELL for literally 10 minutes
03before dying when I hit the ground
12drf
03what
12if you use the Rocket Nozzle, you literally CANNOT reach the ground again lolz
03o.o

03or whatever button it waxz
03-x
03and I hit the ground alright
12I know
5I remember the float feature on Yellow. SO MUCH FUN. I would use it to sneak past the Unknown Dungeon guard and go get Mewtwo with my 99 Master Balls when the only PokÃ©mon I had were a Pikachu and like.. a Rattata. xD
12but Inf. Jump+R Nozzle=Space o3o
03LOL
03no

03and won't go any higher
12I found a GLITCH in Sunshine! :O
12right in Delfino Square...
12there's a murder room in that place o3o
12fall in and you have 2 seconds to escape before you die instantly o3o
03XD
12I'm not joking
5That is insane.
/me was chasing Shadow Mario and the Yoshi Egg and it fell into the murder room...
5D:
/me hides
5One time, I used the Gameshark to make my friend a freaking ARMY of Mews. xD It was the funniest thing. I just transferred them over and his whole team was just Mews.
12lolz
12also
/me made Link comb the Gerudo Desert(Haunted Wasteland) in mid-air o3o
5Hahaha wow.
12since you apparently can't get lost 15ft off the ground o3o
12and as long as you know where the Wastelandends and the Colossus begins, you can skip the Desert using AR
12AH!
/me cringes at the dirty minds at Nintendo...
5OH. This is totally off-topic, but I found this really weird (but amazingly awesome) PokÃ©mon - Legend of Zelda crossover. O:
03inb4 "it was probably a BOY who programmed it"
12o3o Role
12and drf, I don't doubt it was...
03heh
12Role
03usually more than one person works on the games though o.o
5Yeah LL?
12do you know about the Desert Colossus's dirty little secret?
5N-no.
5o-o
12well, I stumbled across it...
/me looks for a YT vid
o.o
lmao
5OMIGOSH I'm rereading the aforementioned crossover and this line caught my eye:
5I now love this story even more LOL.
/me 5is a sucker for whenever the words "star" and "trek" are in the same sentence.
03so I was taking a trek across the desert, when I looked up and saw a star in the sky
/me runs
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg-m1klg8Os >faail you, Nintendo >:|
12-a

03LL, I bet you wish it was you @ that statue?
/me runs

03and that's not Nintendo's fault
EWMA is correct.
/me makes NO comment

03same with Disney and Arabian Nights
03they probably wouldn't hve thought to do that on their own
03:/
12drf
03EW POLITICAL CORRECTNESS
12the thing with Arabian Nights
12that was more easily seen as possibly being racist...
03well
03people are stupid
03and take offense tok everything
03-k
5Yeah.
/me nods >.>
03some random Arab probably took Nintendo to court over the fire thing
5It's kind of ridiculous.
03and said he was offended
03so they said they'd removed it
03-d
12thats why I am SO glad I have the original OoT
thnx
03I'm not saying they aren't sissy for doing so
03but it's not like Nintendo had the idea on their own.
my cat stepped on my keyboard and hit the power button on it
lolwut
12because Ganondorf does NOT look right with green blood o3o;
12(as gross as that sounds)
5Leave the green blood to the Vulcans.

right now it's just in use by the peregrine and myself though
busy
Okies arti
5Hawkiiiiee. That banner is cute. 83
Aw thanks =)
5I also looked at the rest of your site (rest of blackfeatherstudios anyways).
5I like the gallery thing you have where the pictures become clearer when you hover over them with the cursor. That's cool~
Aw lol! the art gallery should have an option to click to enlargen, but I need to ask her to implement it.
I can't code x3;;
but thank you =) I need to fill it with content, four years and nohing has been done LOL
5You could always learn. O:
Haha, noob.
5There are sites out there that teach you CSS.
5xD Dari, who was that?
5That's kind of ridiculous.
Someone on another server. XD
5Fffffff. xD
Never seen them before, they just turned up.
MAKE ME ADMIN NOW
LOL
ew
5YOU ARE AN ADMIN
5xP
5Quit complaining geesh
5./kidding, kidding
give me voice plz
5HI DRF
5What the heck is "Voice" anyways? I keep seeing it places but I've never understood what it is.
03it means if the channel becomes +m then you can talk
Basically it's used in conjunction with +M (I think it's +M), which means you can only talk if you have a voice (+v).
well it allows you to speak when a channel is silenced by +m
Oh, not capitalised m.
5Ahh. I see.
let's give it a try
5What?!
03LOL
03no
03oh LOL hi Arti
I can lk, you. can't!
Xd
talk, ffs
ok now
03see, this is why touchscreen keyboards fail
/me runs
5Can -- can I talk now?
03yes
5YAY.
I was going to voice rp4l
5That was bizarre.
People usually have channels set up for automatic +v on entry with +m on.
03oh
03LOL
you ruined my demo
03XD
03Sorry
03therfe
03*there
5Oh hey~
5 8D
5That's neat.
we tried that once
forgot why we stopped
/me 5is now mute. D:
03XD
/me 5moves her mouth but nothing comes out.
5Oh wait, I'm at a keyboard.
/me turns into Ursula and sucks RP4L's voice out
03that scene gave me nightmares
5LOLwut?
5Oh.
03The Little Mermaid
5Ursula.
5Yeah.
03you know, when she sucks Ariel's voice out?
5I just remembered that.
03yeah
03that's seriously scary to little kids XD
/me 5hasn't seen that movie in yeeeeears.
5Ursula was seriously the only halfway-interesting character in "The Little Mermaid", in my honest opinion.
5But I've always had a soft spot for antagonists...
03LOL
03you remind me of my friend
5Really?
5How so?
03yeah
that's a great film and I can't believe people.complained at the princess and the frof being too.scary with stuff like ursula around
03he tends to like the villians more than the good guys
I'll tyle better after 6pm
5I haven't seen Princess and the Frog yet. D:
03like Jango Fett is his favorite character in Star Wars Episode 2
trying to hide at the mo
5LOL, Arti, **type? /shot
03I honestly think PatF looks kinda dumb
5Understood.
03but yes, Ursula was fricking creepy
5I wanna see PatF because it has JAZZ MUSIC!
03so was Scar in The Lion King
03LOL
03I just don't because it seems dumb
5And it takes place in N'arleans~
03I mean, IMO the good Disney animated films stopped after TLK
03Hercules was alright
03Pocahontas was so-so
03but most of their "traditional" animated movies after that were kinda meh
/me 5tries to think of Disney films that were good post TLK...
03now I did like Atlantis, but that's kinda its own category
03as it wasn't based on a book
brother bear
03that movie sucked
03I actually watched it
why?
03and was like, wtf is this
03I just didn't like it
you still can't give a reason
5Atlantis was good.. I mainly liked that Leonard Nimoy was a VA. xD; But that's aside from the point.
see? LOL
03you still can't give a reason for why it's good :P
03and LOL
5I haven't seen Brother Bear.
03RP4L, have you seen that Bilbo Baggins song? XD
5And if I did, it was a few years back.
5YES.
5OMIGAWD.
5CREEPIEST THING EVER.
03we actually own both Brother Bear movies on DVD
5 xDD
03the second is actually unopened
03I should sell it
good storyline, amazing animation, good. morals
03yeah, but that song got stuck in my head for so long
5There were /two!?/ Dang.
03yes
5What sooooong.
03Brother Bear 2, likely sucks more than the first
03the Bilbo Baggins one
5Oh, ha.
03and Arti, ALL Disney 2D animated movies have good animation
03and good morals
the second is ok... but not better than the firt
5I couldn't bear to watch it more than once DRF.
03XD

03just recorded it off TV this morning XD
03LOL
GOOD ANJMATION???
03I actually didn't hate that movie
/me hides
...
5I looooove Monsters Inc.
THAT WAS HOTRIFIC
5It was not /that/ bad.
Lol, hotrific.
stupid crappy movie
03well
03Home on the Range was the movie that made Disney shut down their 2D animation movie
03*studio
To each their own? :o
03but most of the other ones
exactly
03are good animation
5For sure, Dari. xD
03that's the exceptions that proves the rule
/me hides
03-s
03I'm still tired .=
03*=.=
5Didn't Dreamworks do "Up"?
03no
5Now that was a good movie.
03that was Pixar
5Who did?
5Oh, right.
03That was alright
5I loved Up. 83
03I like pretty much all of Pixar's movies
03it's the only part of Disney that's still good
03their TV channel has turned to crap
03though I didn't really like A Bug's Life that much
03and Finding Nemo, while it's still a good movie, is waaaaay overrated
5...Mainly because it had an amazing score... the same scorewriter who did Star Trek (2009)... Eheheh...
03my favorites are Toy Story and The Incredibles
03XD
5MICHAEL GIACCHINO. 833
03oh yeah
5<333333
03Michael Giacchino FTW
5He won a whole bunch of awards for his work on Up.
03Not because of Star Trek but because of The Incredibles :P
03in fact very few do
5Did he do the music for Incredibles too? o-o
03Yes
your fav Disney films aren't aninal related
03that's where I heard the name
03...XD
03but yes
5YEAH. And he also does/did the music for Lost, Alias, and Fringe.
03I tend to like movies about people more
03I'm not into beastiality
/me runs
5What about Pokeymaaanz?
5D:
that's reallt rude
03and they don't talk
03besides the couple who do
5xP
03well
03Seabiscuit was pretty good
03I know... notice how it's not my favorite?
wtf is that
5Ditto on what Arti said.
03well
03The Lion King is like my 3rd favorite
03who used to be a race horse but then he got injured
03etc
03that one's good though
03then there were like two other movies that used the exact same story that sucked
5Lion King is epic~! It's probably my favourite animated movie. Like ever. Unless I think of another one I like more.
03because they just repeated the same story >_>
I don't like horses
5Which ones were those DRF?
03well that's your problem XD
03um
03Dreamer was the most recent
03and I don't know the name offhand of the other
03yues
03*yes
5(People sometimes tell me I look like her.)
03that movie was ugh
busy again
5'Kay Arti.
03I watched it with her and was like... this is the kids' version of Seabiscuit
03but eh
03my favorite Disney animated movie has to be Aladdin
03The Lion King is good, but it seems overrated... I like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast more
5Really?
03yes
03it's just an epic story
5I thought Beauty and the Beast was better character-wise and plot-wise than Aladdin.
one more thing
5But that's just me.
5What?
I haven't seen Alladin!!
5OO:
5OOOO:
I never really get why people say I don't like ... because it's overrated, surely if lots of people like it, it's because it's good?
5You haven't?!
03LOL Arti, you should see it
5It's so good.
/me hides
5--;;;
There's a parrot?
03actually wait
03Aladdin has that monkey
03what's his name, Abu?
5What about the weird Dragon-thing that Jafar turns into?
5Abuuu~!
5<3
I could swear there's a parrot. :o
03yes
5Yeah.
03Jafar has a parrot
5Jafar's.
Ah.
5I found it kind of annoying. xD
5Chat luuuulllll....
03stupid parrot killed the chat
/me runs
03so like, I need to take a shower
03and o.o RP4L, are you skipping school?
03or are you don?
03*done
5I've been out for a week and a half.
03oh
03nice LOL
5And why would I skip school to go on chat? LOL.
03I would
/me hides
5If I skipped school I'd go to Kansas City or something that wouldn't be a waste of my time.
03Chat is a waste of your time? >:(
5Not that I don't like hanging out here, but I wouldn't sacrifice my education for TST Chat. ^_^;;
03eh
03me is edukated, me no need skool

03LOL
03I actually use the 2000 Office myself
03as I like it slightly better than 2003
5You're right there with whatever program people need.
03but it's basically the same thing
03yes
03that's why people ask me for help :P

Urgh, jobs x.x
5Yeah. But it would be better than sitting around bored.
/me yawns
12that was a nice nap
5Besides, once I hit college I can't blow off all my money anymore. So I'm trying to take advantage of what's left of my pre-university years. xD;
12start enjoying the taste of ramen noodles :P
5xP
12np i love the taste of ramen noodles
5Well I plan on getting a really good scholarship or two into where I want to go...
5...So maybe with the money I save I can live on something other than Ramen, aha.
12the secret
12is to work someplace that sells food
5xD
12and get great worker discounts
5I dunno if I'll be going to a University here in town or about sixty miles south in Lincoln.
5So if I go to UNL (in the latter city aforementioned) I'll have to get a new job...
/me blank stare
5...Provided I even get a job HERE in the first place.

03that
I thought it was weird you pasted it again
LOOL
poor dinosaurs!
5xDDD
5I should take that to church DRF.
5My pastor would get a kick out of it.
03go for it o.o]
/me sitsonnaBeto
what IS the churches explanation for dinosaurs? ?
5Um...
5They existed?
5LOL, I dunno.
the dinosaurs are the ones that didn't fit in the ark.
*sigh*
/me ahem
5The Bible isn't to be taken literally.
*over here
5Most of it's symbolic.
orly?
how come they always cite it in a literal sense then?
5It's a guidebook for how to live a moral life, not a history book (not really anyways).
RP4l more people should have that attitude lol
just annoying people like my uncle take it all word for word
5Yeah. -sigh- But ya can't change people.
he's one who thinks Pokemon is evil
5I mean I believe the whole "Jesus died for us, was ressurrected, etc. etc.." but I know that Jonah didn't /really/ get eaten by a whale.
I think the heaviest basher's approach to dinosaurs is "they were placed by god as a test of our conviction"
5Ffff I want to write a sermon and involve PokÃ©mon in it. xD
5Wut.
Some people take the Bible literally.
Others don't.
5I kinda want to go into Ministry, actually. Go to seminary.
5But at the same time I want to go into Physics.
5Auuugh too many interests. ;;
I know that feeling
I guess that's why I am so lost career wise, I don't wanna be stuck in an office forever
but I don't know what I want most
5I'll probably end up going the Physics route.
5I know that in the ministry pastors (for the United Methodist church) always get moved; I'd hate to get attached to a church and then have to leave four; five years later.
5I had a pastor that was practically part of my family and when he left I was devastated...
I had that happen to me when I was little
03more religious stuff *flips to another channel*
5We're not arguing DRF. D:
03XD
03still
03I stay away from religious discussions
03because I don't really relate to them
5Aren't you fascinated by Philosophical discussion?
yeh we know
03I'm like... I believe in God but that's about it, I don't know if I buy the rest of the crap that the church teaches
03and no I'm not LOL
5xP
03now if you start talking about technology...
/me runs
you just like to keep saying it and involving yourself anyway
03XD
03is that a bad thing?
5I like this; what Gandhi said:
is what a bad thing?
yes because its annoying
I dunno, I find it hard to believe in something that we made up. :o
03XD
phone
03yeah, that reminds me of a Bash quote
dari, exactly.
5Bash?
03"I don't mind God, it's his fan club I Can't stand"
03yeds
03*yes
5xD DRF, yeah.
5Actually, a lot of good things have happened in the name of God, but you only hear about the bad stuff.
5Red Cross, UMCOR, Salvation Army...
/me 5shrugs.
5Two sides to everything.
03except a square.
03that has four sides/
/me runs

5BREAKFAST CLUUUUUUUUUB.
03yeah
5I love that movie.
03same
5It's got the guy from Dead Zone.
03I haven't seen it in a while, which is why I'm watching it again
5<333
03I recorded it off TV yesterday
5Nice.
03I quite like this jock character
5Who do you like best of the crew?
03because I always hated jocks
5Oh, ahah.
03but the fact that he actually feels bad about it
03is cool
5I've never had issues with "jocks".
03and the fact that he admitted to not being able to think for himself XD
03well
03I'm a nerd
5In fact I usually get along really well with them. xD
03jocks tend to beat up nerds
5I am too DRF!
03yes but you're a girl
5But I'm also (A) a girl and (B) I love sports.
03I'm like that guy he was talking about beating in the movie
03*up
5I always argue with the jocks on what teams are best. It's fun. 83 And then -- bam! Friends with a jock.
03well, I just hate the people who think they're so cool because they do sports
03I am friends with one guy who was on the football team
03which was nice
03but he was also into video games
03I just hate those "I'm captain of the football team, I'm the coolest person in the world" type
5Aahh.
5...I don't know any of those types, LOL.
03Yes
5No.
So it's NOT just stereotypical films.
5>>;;
5I've never seen people being mean to "nerds" that are "jocks" at my school.
5And we have over 2500 people here.
03we had like 2000
5I think if you just find common ground then it's all fine.
/me 5shrugs.
03well being one of the ones who always got harrased by jocks
03I think I have the right to say they do act that way
03in middle school at least... in high school they kinda left me alone
5Hm. Well, that's really unfortunate. =/
03yep
03that's why I'm used to people making fun of me
Wth is middle school.
Middle school = primary school?
5Middle school is like ages 12-14.
036th-8th grade
03or that
5**7th - 8th grade here.
03there were literally days I'd come home from school crying
5D:
03because of what people would say to me
03back in 7th and 8th grade
03most of those were the football players >_>
5I can't believe could be that mean!
03Yeah
...So you have a whole separate school, just for 2 years?
5(My middle school football team sucked LOL.)
03for 3, here
5Sometimes four years Dari.
Ok... O_o
5It varies from district to district.
weird....
but anywsy
I had horrible things said to me too
03typically I think boys make fun of boys and girls make fun of girls
03right?
Not really.
5oo;; I feel so bad. Like I'm the only person here who wasn't traumatized as a teenager. Or made fun of, or whatever.
03XD
03well
At my sister's old school, some of the boys spat at her.
03You're probably "cool"
no, boys make fun of everyone here
^ Yeah,
03here, the boys were too polite to do that
03which I find funny
03I guess they wanted a chance to have girlfriends, dunnol
03-l
Some kid threw a bin at my sister. O_o
5Yeah, sometimes my friends give tease me a little 'cause I'm such a big Trekkie and PokÃ©mon fan, but it's all in jest. They do it 'cause I make of my self anyways. xD
03ah, well
03that's what stopped them for me
03I started making fun of myself
03that's probably why XD
03but I used to get hell for being a Pokémon fan, I had to stop telling people I liked it
5**make fun of myself
5Really?
Or when people got bored with it, could be a while though.
5DRF, when people catch me drawing a PokÃ©mon they are like, "Hey, is that a PokÃ©mon? Is that Mewtwo?" and I'm all like, "...Yeah..." and then we get into a big nostalgic thing about it. xD
5It's amazing what people will say when you doodle. o3o
03yeah
03well this is back when Pokémon wasn't as cool
5And people have this bizarre fascination with my fanfics.
schools in England are just disgusting. ..most of them
03same here, but mine was pretty good actually
5So I dunno what's up with the differences between Nebraska and where you live, DRF, LOL.
03which is one reason my parents moved here
03Troy School District is said to be like one of the top 10 in the country
5(Midwestern hospitality FTW?)
seriously I've been physically assaulted enough times
5DD:
03and our county is the 4th safest in the country too
03probably why they moved here, like I said XD
5In school Arti?
Mm, some kids in primary school (year 6) tried to rape my sister's friend in the toilets.
mostly from other schools infact, on my way home from school
WTF
Yeah, and we went to a pretty good primary school too.
rp4l, I went to an all girls school so people weren't so bad
5Wow.
Brb
5'Kay Dari.
but every other school around us..
>v>
5Daaaaang.
I still had an army of bitches in my school but at least they didn't attack me, only say mean things lol
5For some reason, people have just never been mean to me. I count my blessings.
5Well, there was that one girl who I am CERTAIN stalked me throughout Elementary school... she was mean to me...
5><
5For no reason!
yeh well, like I said.. kids and schools in this country ffs...
5Gosh. But seriously, I switched schools Kindergarten to first grade, so did she. I switched third grade to fourth grade, so did she. It was creepy! But 4th to 5th grade we were in different schools, thank God.
And all of them seem to drink, smoke, and do various drugs.
I was on the train just last week in a very rich.area. and these 10-16s got on that were fare dodging and smelled of drugs
At my current school they not many people do, I go to a good school now.
few and far between
I have no idea why but somehow in 2-3 years just about all smoking at my school has stopped
Yeah, it's and all-boys grammar school.
5Same here Dari. A lot of druggies.
go around all the places where they did ... no-one there. And I can find no explanation
5Strangely, though, I've never been offered anything. And if I ever do, I just tell people I'm allergic.
Oh, so stingy. :P
5Them: "Hey, want a smoke?" Me: "Nah, I'm allergic. So please don't smoke around me." Them: "Oh, that sucks. Okay."
"allergic to what?" "Idiots who want to stick strange chemicals they got from a dude down a back alley up their noses."
5And then they leave me alone.
5I actually think I am allergic to cigarettes...
waaaaat
isn't a good ol' adrenalin high enough enymore?
/me wants Six Flags.
guaranteed 100% harmless to humans and from a trusted source
well, that is, if you trust yourself.
lol
I feel uncomfortable talking about smoking, drugs etc. anywhere but here..
people take it so normal these days
like I walk down the street and can smell drugs as if they were cigarettes
5I got an Adrenaline High writing a fanfic once. xDD
5I was typing at literally ten bazillion words a minute. It was crazy. But I had so much fun writing that chapter aha.
and its always kids and uni students
lol
arti, being near bradford may have biased you *cough*
there is so much to life and people stick to drugs....
lol
5Yeah. It's kinda sad actually.
one thing about here is that Bradford rarely crosses over
infact, all the rubbish areas in Leeds seem to keep to themselves
brb
can we reeeeeally say anything about "it's kinda sad" while here?
5What do you mean?
internet chat 'n all
its like, harmless..
yo
I'm really never against what other people wanna do with their lives unless it harms others
sure I think what some people do is retarded but I don't think irc is LOL
Yeah, I was being able to do what you want in your own home, as long as it doesn't affect other people.
for*
anyway lol brb again, stopping me from working
5That's fine Arti,
5**.

I got PMed to come to the chat about some sort of "religious" thing.

who?
I agree
Spyro22 is the one
5Hi anyone who's here.
Swaff's always been that way I've done my best to ignore it
\o
I don't really know why we always get so many over-religious members...i
It's always really annoyed me but I just do my best to stop the situation and try to forget about it
Im thinking about removing the restricted topics rule.
hmm
Where is everybody?
Look at their sigs too.
It'd sure cause a lot of e-hellfire but if you think that's what's best then go for it
Hello
Hello
Why have I never noticed this before?
I need to get my eyes checked :P
Don't feel bad, I didn't notice it until a few months ago
It's been up for a few years
sometimes members come though
a har and a half I think.
year*
O.o I overslept until 14:00!
SR I think it's been up about two years didn't it start in summer 2008?
Not as bad s BlogTV
10I oversleep often
Just got a scope for my airsoft gun =P
I dont remember the exact date, it might have been longer than I thought.
Red dotted too
I can't find the post I made two seconds before. I usually go onto theneedledrop's BlogTV
I ripped the scope off my airsoft gun because its never acurate enough anyways.
It's quite funny, he's really cool
/me puts kipi on his bak
The scope is actually a real rifle scope, but it fits perfectly
Too bad the gun is black and the scope is camo though
Keyboard is being retarded again
Black airsoft is illegal in canada.
It needs to be clear with an orange tip.
Really? That's the only thing they sell in Dick's
I think they all need an orange tip in every country
5That's like... insanely late.
;-; Half the day is gone
5The latest I've ever slept is 11:30 AM.
This never happens
5And I was sick. ><
I'm going to an airsoft party this weekend. I've never been to one, but I can't imagine it worse than paintball.
5Were ya up late?
that's like the normal time i sleep to if I have nothing due that day lol
i usually wake up 8:00-ish.
not 14.00
Apparently when you turn 18 in the UK you can apply for your shotgun permit and go skeet shooting
Paintball would be worse because the mass of a paintball is much higher than that of an airsoft bb.
Even on days I go to sleep late, I'm usually up by 10:00-12:00
XP
Awesome, I just got a flashlight for my rifle too.
It's not a very good one, but it works fine
Why would you need a flashlight?
I have a green laser.
I taped it on there with electrical tape.
12lol
Works really well when you wear blue tinted goggles.
The man's method
Playing during the night? I don't know, but I have 3 slots that I can put things on,
Need to find one more thing to put on the rifle...
Any ideas?
Bayonette
In an airsoft gun fight?
I play during the day.
Why not? Be original
Dude, we're not actually trying to kill each other.
And besides, the slots are on the two sides and top. The bayonet wouldn't reach the tip
Damn
10Altguest
Wait, how does this whole thing work?
ugh ._.
The BBs keep curving upwards when I shoot
No grooving in the barrel
Maybe that's because I'm using light BBs?
Oh you use BB rounds. Which hurt like fuck on bare skin
Umm...
lol creative
Airsoft gun, not a real BB gun...
Hop-up?
this is my last day in this place thankfully
What's a hop-up?
I'll stick to my shotgun
you want a little bit of curve up though for distance.
moving into the apartment with a half-decent connection tomorrow, i hope
are they going right up within 20 feet of firing?
Yrd
Yes
yeah thats the hopup.
07hooray for half-decent?
07I guess?
07o3o
What's a hop-up?
take a pic of your gun and ill show you where to adjust it.
Okay, one sec
Hopup is a little piece of rubber that scrapes the top of the bb as its propelled out.
the farther down it is, the more spin thats put on the bb, and the faster it will curve upwards
you need to find the sweetspot between curve and distance.
12Is that cos of your house..? >v<
12hmm
Yeah ._.
12it could be half bad
/me 5is on dA oogling over art she wishes she could draw up to par with.
5xD;
Sounds like fun anyway
12Bleh, drawing..
5Whoa, chat = lagging.
cheap guns don't have a hopup adjustment, but the better ones do.
5oo;;
http://uploads.mibbit.com/yBtMTx.jpg
Where do you guys go? To fight that is
I don't think I have a hopup adjustment
I dont think so either
forgot to mention, I'm possible going away again, not sure how long though
Then I don't
12Where/why?
Ill show you what mine looks like.
I got it for $70, and it can with a pistol
Friends, because I need time away from home
And we don't "go" anywhere
You play where you want, like in the woods
It's like paintball except more realistic and less painful. But I never played airsoft before
You guys would have a ball at Linear Park, it's just up the road from me. It's quite big
Well I don't normally play with guns. I'm more of a nerd.
12Cant come to Leeds though??
You'd have a ball in my back yard.
But my friend invited me, and I thought "Why not?"
You can be a nerd and like guns.
I thought I already explained why I couldn't
How big is your yard?
2 acres
12No, you've been saying different things the past few months
80 acres of forest, ponds, and fields
see the part thats flapped open?
But I'm not going to play at my house
Your yard is officially cool
thats where you'd adjust the hopup.
Hey SR, is that your hand? :o
I'm pretty I said that I had to use the savings I had for leeds to travel between home and my nans
My yard is tiny
pretty sure*
Haha, I've seen your hand! XD
How do the guns work?
I think my phone takes pretty good pictures.
How many MP is your phone?
Depends
12Yes you did say that but after that you said you might still be coming, then you gave no reason the next time I asked..
5mp
Haha
Pretty good.
Very funny
Some guns are spring-action, some are bolt-action, some are electric, and some are hybrids
lol this is getting ridiculous
/me should be an optician
12So, no chance of saving up before July then??
Hybrids look the coolest, since they give off smoke and eject cartridges for extra effect
You need an electic one.
there are co2 ones too.
but for your money, electric.
Spring-action are the cheapest
Hold on let me check something
$20 gets you a fully automatic electric gun.
Looks like I've got some searching to do
Probably even less in the usa.
That one in the pic above was $100 at walmart
3rd to 4th right?
You'll still never hit anything with a scope
Â£29.90 for a Smith and Wesson M3000 Clear
w/ be happening?
so many variables for airsoft because the bbs are so light.
even if you get .20 gram.
TST Summer meet
they still go all over the place.
oh
I totally knew that
lol
5One of these years, I'mma get a plane ticket and meet all ya'll over there in Europe.
M4
You can get it at walmart as the "M4 field duty kit"
I should make it to England sometime
TST goes to Warsaw
I don't have Walmart in the UK
Sometime. Possible 2012.
Not sure yet, it's an idea :>
Â£59.95 for the On Duty Kit
Online
I don't know about that SR, my rifle would be pretty accurate if not for the curving
5./shot
5xD
that might be too la- damnit
Why O-o
xD
OH
LOL
fdkhjsgihdfv
lol
5LOL, 2012 girl.
And I've yet to see one above $250
I have used it outside
5But ffff. It's a bunch of hooey.
It will fire all over the place.
RP4L: but what if you get there in 2020? :P
Small air currents throw bbs off.
spend the last days partying
It doesn't take much.
wait what
Using it inside might be a bad idea

Found that out by accident when I didn't realize it was already pumped. When I saw it shoot 2 BBs, I tried pumping it multiple times
But what I really want to do, is go skeet shooting
it's boring

It does make sense.
How so?
/aud
5"Crap" is an adjective. "Mother" isn't.
:<
yes it is
people can have different ideas of what a mother is
LOL
5Ehhh.
just dont mind him
5Why do I even try.
/me is never wrong
Understood
he's full of idiotic remarks LOL
5xDD
5xDDDDDD
just
take everything he says with a grain of salt if it sounds totally weird
that's the way to deal :p
Oh noeses
Ohh god...
I'M DOOMED AREN'T I.
5No one can grasp your "wisdom" BF.
/me the Eternally Right
I just read the "Rules you live by" thread I made...
Need more funeral doom
5Your wisdom is eternally illogical.
*right
5If you were assimilated by the Borg they'd all die of illogic.
things don't have to be logical, man
LOL
5It would kill them.
lol, I saw that too
ah |3
12BF you're getting on my nerves lately D:
/me kicks
how am I doing that?
but its his job
I'm so gonna burn in Hell
5Ditto on what Espeon said.
12Your comments, I don't like the,
12*them
12dsfdsf
you're all gonna burn in hell
Articuno
what don't you like about them?
Meet you there =P
dun dun DUN
Is he even more obonxious than usual?
lol
me too :D
But seriously, I'm sick of these people acting as missionaries
I know Toby personally
12Obnoxious is the word! And just plain rude to new members
I'm def going to hell
at least we have an active chat :x
/me doesn't remember any of this
5What PM?

12Lies
Oh ok.

12Lies and hypocricy
Just sort of random, watermellons :P haha.
12GAH
you don't even know me in person!
slander
that's w/ it is
>:(
Don't dis the watermellons
12I can't spell either
I should include another rule of mine "With friends like these, who needs enemies?"
/me read word as world x.x
Owl City =P
DESTROY OWL CITY!
12Oh and about dates for Cumbria, likely 29th June onwards
Kidding XD
5Doesn't w/ = with? haha. I've never seen it as = what.
well I didn't realise that everbody was that bothered
I just learned the Manager of my Wal Mart is a JW
no wonder he hates everyone
I used to like owl city before he blew up
RP4L: it is the new law of the internets? :p
12Yeh I don't get how w/ can be with
JW?
*sigh*
HOW MANY times
i assumed that is anybody was bothered they would just ignore the statement
12BF
have we told you people are bothered?
I'm waiting to preached at for my Burzum
*siiiiiiiiigh*
Jehovah's Witness
XD
hahahaahaha
12I am not talking about other people, I'm just telling you what I think XD
well
5Huh. o-o I never knew that difference in shorthand between continents.
*knock* *knock* Shit happens
I liked Owl City too, but once his firefly song came up, people started treating him as a pop star.
/me 5learned something new today. o3o
thing is, Articuno, he generally is just weird, and I can't think he'd ever forget
it's not a difference, it's me being lazy
when others were bothered
Then I found the Postal Service
I was at my great grandpa's house (hes blind and pretty old, I was taking care of him that day) and some JWs showed up
and I just dont want to have that issue again
so I invited them in and we had a chat.
12Huh what?
to be honest lol
I don't like his lyrics
aaaaargh what
postal service is great
the washing machine is roaring
o.o
brb
5o-o;;
lord, I only said I thought Lady Gaga was crap
12What?
blarg
5It's /fine/ BF.
!espeon
Some JWs came to my door one time, but I didn't even know who they were
well that's what this all came from
i hate it when i get just a minute
I didn't think i had any up here
12No it's not
12I didnt even see that comment LOL
till the Pepsi guy ruined my fun
i need to get my espeon steal script
seems to happen a lot
:c
Mmm, pepsi.
Watch out for the Mormons
But once they showed me a Bible and asked if I had one, I told them I was an atheist
Pepsi FTW!
Bad move
RP4L: you writting Star Trek or?
I think my sister is becoming a mormon
/me RAGE. BORED.
/me votes Coke
5@Brother :: Eh... crossover fic?
/me 5runs!
12I dunno why everyone's making such a huge deal about what I said! Couldn't you tell I was teasing him???
PEPSI
Their faces were almost pale when I told them that.
no i couldn't!
^
Not surprised
12Oh well
12NOW YOU KNOW HOW EVERYONE ELSE FELS
12HAHA
5Hi Lugia! Maybe you can be the peacemaker! 83
o.o
YES
BUT I WON'T STOP
hi Lugia
/me steeples fingers and cackles
We're all def going to hell according to them
freakign awesome
Tell anyone that is theistic that you're an atheist is always a bad move
I can't wait till tomorow... ><
12If you stopped you wouldn't be BF
I would have said I had one, but I burned it because I couldn't be bothered to go and get firewood. :o
/me gives Quilava a cookie
I wish people wouldn't be so... Heavy with religion
its a balloon cookie :P
I should kick them all out to Vermont
I'm theistic and I could care less if you're an atheist
that state is already screwed up enough
5Did you know that "steeples" isn't recognized by MS Word?
but I'd still be sexy
hi
/me nibbles
5Ohgawd.
5>>;
I'm not one to hate those who disagree with me
b^___^b
12that was random
5Yeah, yeah, whatever. xP
RP4L: you just opened the line for someone to use that 300 reference :p
12Whatever
almost all of my closest friends are atheists actually
I like you
fine
5What 300 reference?
[05:35:26 pm] <Quilava> I can't wait till tomorow... >< <- lol why?
I've always found it interesting how a lot of people seem to really freak out whenever they hear someone isn't the same religion as them.....
he gets a new monitor hopefully
12...
ah
RP4L: "maybe you can be peacemaker" "There can be no peace, THIS IS SPAR- I mean. TST!"
Inorite?
assuming my mom's friend's ex husband can manage to get to his interview so we can borrow their car
I mean, I can understand people wanting to believe in a "highest power", but I can't stand missionaries.
12-v-
lol
I was called a satanist because I listened to metal
/me zzzz's now
12I HATE that movie XD

04aww screw this mem
besides Monty python is better imho
04meme*
04I can't do it
That means something COMPLETELY different... If you know what I mean =P
How are 300 and Monty Python comparable? o.O
one sucks
the other has crude humor
[22:37:45] <~Articuno> I HATE that movie XD <--- 300?
:|
Ohh no wait...
My life will be complete once I make a priest shout "OH MY GOD!"
5I like to randomly quote Star Trek when it suits me. Like randomly screaming "KHAAAAAAAN" whenever I feel like it.
brb running
COMPELS
they both joke around, in their own way
Yep, you're right. It is compels
RP4L: really? XD
But it still doesn't make sense XD
5Oh yes.
my favorite Chaplain is a guy I play CoD with who feels compelled to bash everyone's sins away
12lol
i'm sick of 300
I like to hurt people's feelings.
12yeh 300 sucks
my school mascot is a spartan
12OH SHUT UP BF
Ever seen "The God Warrior" on trading spouses?
nebar
and we see the clip every. friggin. day.
i actually love that film
I have never heard of a chaplain playing CoD
XD
12brb phone!
i just dislike the meme that spawned from it
hahahahhah the god warrior
that's awesome
Well now you know
hmm
I did a lipsync to her with this remix someone made
Then I might get sick of him and bash his head against the wall with a bible and a can of coke
even Chaplains enjoy killing
12kkk

What version of CoD are you playing anyway?
United Offensive
wth, never heard of that.
it's the expansion pack to the original PC game
Oh.
I don't play the Modern Warefar ones
this one has more entertaining p layers
and less hackers
www.klazyklan.com
No one hacks CoD MW2 on PS3.
....
XD
XD
:o
*snore*
I hear nothing but stories from players returning to the original because the new ones are overrun with hackers
maybe no PS3
might just be Xbox Idk
/me is bored with the new gow album on repeat :\
hiho :)
/me hugs da Quilava :)
gow?
/me squeaks and hugs back
good old war
to be honest any game is like that on Xbox Live
I dunno, I've played for ages and haven't found any.
the Xbox Live community is kind of immature
I see
folk band
I want my Darkspace
hackers though, haven't run in to much of them
maybe even country idk
Okay
except in CoD3
I need dark ambience!
your what
Darkspace
what's that
Ambient black metal
Very loud and ominous
/me coughs
well and I wouldn't know I don't play it lol, just stick to my version
ok then
I find it more entertaining
I don't think you'll enjoy it
I like a lot of things.
don't
Just not everything :P
CoD3 sucked
Okay
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi6howzn7v8
See what you think
that's why I'm trying to get all of you to play my version :P

Sunn is more like Earth only deeper

Do you want to try Sunn?
if you're talking like lyrics wise then I meant by sound not by words

They're pretty good
Hmmm. GOW is quite good
it's kind of hard not to know Kyu
I never did get that, a ban being temporary
i think i've been on the internet too long, everytime i see a forum post out of the ordinary i think "is this guy trolling?"
I like his voice

02I'm fine in English, it's HER English class that I hate
ohhhh
Haha
/me understands that ^^;;
more people
Quite the party in Spyrochat today
Get it right.
lol
The only time I've ever been in summer school (to turn my %85 in Grade 12, university-track English into a %90+)... I found is /hilariously/ simple.
lol
....what
whats with all teh forum people now
hi shiny
late
Yeah it is
Doppel was a lightning dragon, remember?
Do we condone burning churches?
haahahhahahaha
didn't he actaully threaten to do something like that to Raidon once?
02hey
DID HE???
oh my god lol lol lol
/me is drawing some things on the computer atm
/me dies
Is it compulsary? O_o
there was a huge argument on darkspyro I remember
because they got [censored]ed over some religious crap
07no
wow hahahah
02If you fail a class in regular school, you have a chance to make up the credit in the vaction time of summer
yep
07it's to make up for ....fien D:
I don't particularly like Doppel or Raidon, so I wasn't sure who I wanted to win :P
(In Canada (i.e. where I am) it's compulsary if you fail, extremely badly. And I mean massive failure.)
why doesn't someone just lock the thread or something
Credit for what?
Yeah Radeon wasn't my favroite person to talk to.
(However... if you're going for the purposes of "My grade average! The 85 destroys it!" reasons... no it's not compulsory. :P )
because apparently they're done talking about it
02Credits to graduate
The question is, who cares about it.
if they don't stop though I'll lock it
any porn?
what thread was this?
And they matter for...University?
I thought I changed my "Away" message ... hold on a sec.
the dragon and magic one
Ah
02I don't draw that
uh
that's no fun :/
07for any grade you're in
02Yeah
hahahahah the metal thread
haters keep on hatin
I had fun with that
some kid on darkspyro got all mad at me because I told them that Red wasn't metal
i could of swore i saw a tshirt with that on it
But it's true
lol
i know for elementary and middle school grades, you have to attend summer school to move to the next grade
coz they're not they're a rock band and then they called me obnoxious and I lol'd so hard
I know
if of course you fail.
ahh ok
Then Bullet For My Valentine?
So you stay in the same year if you fail and don't retake? Looooooooool.
Let's see if it's working ...
at least that's how it is here :P
hahahahahh
Since when were they metal?
Crap
why do so many people like bullet for my valentine anyways I just don't understand
i've never failed a class so i wouldn't know the details XD
Ontario elemntary schools are rather... dimwitted about failures... namely, no matter how badly one does... they will advance you.
Haha, it doesn't matter how badly you do here, they might ask you to retake the test, but that'll just be during school time.
and now it's a battle of music in spyrochat
:P
Cuz they're awesome maaaaan
It's like Attack Attack
I love attack attack XDD
idc what people say it's better than brokencyde
the aiecebosaur against all teh little random people
I find it mind-boggling that you'd keep anyone back, looooool.
that's Canada for ya *runs*
Attack Attack is the only band that made me want to kill myself
it's not a music debate lol
However, enter high school and...
Not sure if they even can do that in England. Haha.
Welcome to the Land of Pain and Torture. :P

I thought you'd like it
Wow people are idiots
No thank you. I would rather not kill myself.
They really are
I heard BrokeNCYDE
Alright.
"Wah wah wah, I don't make a living wage in my service-industry job!" Well work harder and find another job then!
The blood never washed out

Then I switched to Diary of Dreams
brokencyde makes me depressed
Ooh, what's going on in here? :o
It's funny how people come here that aren't even part of S. F.
BrokeNCYDE makes me rage
I find it extremely funny because I'll be payed more than my mom, so how exactly are they not making enough money?
a whole lots a things
and they could always get a second job
Because they're lazy idiots who just want to complain about something and make themselves victims
Metalcore is just complete and utter w
XD
:O Eeeep!
That's exactly what my dad was talking about the other day
Hardcore = pure wank
People complaining that they don't make enough money, therefore something must be wrong with how their employer is treating them
XD

Che Guevara
I remember that you don't like it. :P
O_o
Not really. Lyndon is my real name though
Azure :3
You shouldn't lie.
I didn't
I made a joke
whats wrong with saying your full name?
Heheh
Nothing
It's fun
whats up
Because *cough* people can stalk you
So?
*cough* kill *cough*
Nobody wants to stalk me anyway, they think I'm borderline psychotic
well if you don't mind being stalked
You shouldn't kill.
Guess you're safe
:3
Some people think I' mad
o.o
Well, maybe you are.
You're undermining my mocking. :o
I was accused of being a Satanist for listening to metal
i prefer ot think your angry
lol
...Yeahhhh
Which is funny because I don't even believe in Belial
being angry's not fun
12X33
Or Satan
I don't know how you'd be able to say "yeahhhh" and still include all of the h sounds.
12Caw caw
12:D
It's dragged out
"Yeah huh huh huh huh ..."
what's wrong dude
actually its a mixture of h and a
brb. Need to switch computers
: )
o:3
12XD
no, altair is doing other things.
anyway going over to the apt. bbl maybe
this is weird.. my speakers on this netbook are on the bottom of it
That's how mine are
D:
and they are crap...
No room next to the screen I guess?
That's not weird, sound travels better through solid objects than air?
Yeah
yeah but you got to hear it in the solid object otherwise its still going to be in the air when you reciev it
the asus has it in teh bottom
I have a Dell with Windows 7. It's insanely fast and reliable.
too
back
...Eugh windows 7.
thats a little vague
Well, at least it's better than vista.
the only thing I don't really like about windows seven is the fact that you can't move files, you have to copy/paste them instead
really?
or is that just windows 7 starter
What? I can move files all I want.
other than that I really like it
/me THROWS TONGS
TONGS
starter i cant even change the background
... without copying and pasting.
its stuck on the beach background
thongs
;]
/me puts Quilava in a tong
Windows will always have bugs
I can change the background :D I've started making BGs again it's fun
I can help you with that.
probably not even a bug
/me :|?
Macs have better Operating Systems, but, Windows has better programming
lol
o-o
/me is gonna go see Robin Hood tonight
speaking of background have you seen my new pic
expecting to have fun criticizing it\
Prince: Both.
how's that work? D:
mac sux
You can move files just like any os.
If your moving into a protected area though you need to confirm you want to do that.
like program files
or /windows
Macs don't get viruses, because people could care less about them, so they last longer
*Kaspersky*
However, Windows has quite a few useful programs, when they work properly
they /get/ viruses, they're just a lot fewer of them
*there're
Maybe.
Brand new operating system with new kernel and everything.
Because a virus has to be programmed for that set OS.
How would it?
Exactly
viruses, plural
Would you call my OS secure?
Heheh
;3
If I had a lot of money I'd get a Mac, not install an antivirus, and see how long it would take to get a virus on it
Yes, for the time being
Is lack of malware = secure?
depends on what you would call secure
12;D
/me runs
Would be interesting
I just gave up on AV, and firewalls.
But, because Windows is more popular, it has more viruses.
It is not inheritly secure
^W^
robbin hood?
http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3954597/
thats why its naieve to say an os I make in my basement is secure.
:P
yeah
it could be full of holes, but no one wants to exploit them because its not a target.
duno
what's a tong?
XD
Meh
Exactly.
Really, I don't want to talk computers
I'm going
=/
k...
My formula for a good windows setup is #1. microsoft security essentials
O_o
he's a joke
jinx dari
#2, comodo firewall.
Done.

12That.
o_O
I keep getting random trojans
http://www.lavallab.com/images/platinum-tongs-gx200-5g.gif
12o.o
Mine is MBAM, scan every couple months. XD
Stupid McAfee
12Oh
12well
12Either one
12xD
a monthly scan does you no good if you get infected
You need proactive protection.
lul
Nothing bad
I don't put any important information on my computer, so it doesn't matter.
Just forums
Alright.
it also is very light on resources.
its a costume
hmm
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/
12Wat
dont pay for antivirus, microsoft has a really good one not many people know about.
Yeah
looked up a free firewall and i got online armor and it was crap
But does it block programs and stuff?
We can't get on the internet without McAfee
its.. a pair of tongs
Its just like any other antivirus
but its really good.
Meh.
I suppose I can add them to the exception list.
I can't believe it's not butter.
If it has one.
Comodo firewall is free and good.
makes for a great costume huh?
Nice combination
it has an exceptions list.
..no :|
ew norton
would you rather i put you in a pair of thongs
Norton is bloated
?
Oh God no, not Norton.
It uses too much memory.
lol
Norton broke my internet. XD
Norton is crap
12xD
mine doesnt do too bad
Is Norton the one that has the parental controls that make you log in when you use the internet?
i dunno
We had an antivirus that did that once
Yes, well, that's what my parents got. I would really like to get Kaspersky, but I have no money.
Last time I had Norton a virus broke it, and my internet didn't work until I uninstalled it using their program which wipes all Norton products from your computer.
I think it was Norton
nortons is yellow
I remember having dial-up and having to do that
That was annoying
It kept doing that every half hour or so
kaspersky really bogged down my computer when i got it
whenever our internet minutes were up my parents would change the password
Whenever I have a client who needs a reinstall or needs me to setup their new laptop, I always install security essentials and comodo firewall.
Yay, my copy of windows is genuine.
those were my Neopets days
Finally, something I haven't pirated.
XD
Is security essentials a brand or setting?
anyone here? o.o
Aah ...
moi
2eh?
2not I
whats good about comodo firewall
Its one of microsoft's better products.
It is even partially an antivirus.
If I got a firewall I know I'd just portforward every single port.
So there's not much point.

what happens if you have a meltdown?
12dunno
Norton is so crap.
norton has horrible detection
It's all I can use for now.
Also it's an AV and a virus broke it.

12Yay :D
12Wb
12X3
yawn
hey
12Yawn indeed. :U
what was your site name again?
hi
^^
03Hi :3
12c:
Okies!
thought it was info but ok
03that's my server
12Xai fails, he left my PC on all day XD
07ohaiburd
12Hi ^^
03what's wrong with that?
03I always leave my computer on, ew turning computers off
12We have to PAY for our electricity you know
03computers don't use that much power
03just turn the monitor off
12Where I can save money I will
07yes they do o3o
12If I left my computer on every day it would eat up money
03I figured it out for my parents once
03it costs like a dollar a month
03to leave your comptuer on 24/7
03*computer
03assuming like 500WQ
03-Q
03my new one is like 600,b ut still
12Wheee~!
12DRF thats like saying "I dont care if I leave the lights on all the time"
12It wastes electricity
03not really
03because lights have no reason to be on when you aren't home
lol
03my computer, on the other hand, does
12Same with my computer
03as I use it as a file server and I record TV on it...
12I don't need it on, I have a server
03and I encode stuff while I'm sleeping
12and thats on 24/7
03it's more pro to just use your computer as a server
12I keep on finding epic win music.
12<3
12No it's not n00b
03but I mean, I'll do CPU-intensive stuff when I'm asleep
03so that way it doesn't slow me down during the day
03I suppose if you have two computers you don't need both on... but I only have one so eh
12Our server is really efficient as well
03well, not counting my laptop
12Mine on the other hand is not
XD
12Indeed XD
hmm...
/me roars for no apparent reason.
12o.o
Or Apc
Hello
How is everybody?

/me has been swimming in the sea all day :3
Hello to all
Hello
12Wow

Once your able to at least
one of the great things once I have my pilot's license (did I tell you my first theory class is starting monday?) is: I'm never too far away from the sea :)
I dont know if everyone knows this, but you must use your spyroforum nicknames in this chatroom.
14Nice :)
Just a heads up for anyone who might not be... *cough*
14And good luck with it ^^
thanks :)
Man, this would be easier if I had some sort of template or concept art.
I can't draw at all =P
12I'm not that far from the sea either but it costs a bit to go there
12Until I get my rail pass
14The one thing that bugged me about the sea today
Its too bad theres no guides for compiling spidermonkey for php-cgi windows...
14It was stupidly warm ovo
Oh well, will figure it out eventually.
I have a big river close to my - my Father Rhein
12Thats how i like it.. I wont swim in cold sea XD
That's a javascript engine, right?
14No Arti, the Sea (here anyway) usually always has that chill
the icy birdo is cold quite quickly :P
14But today it was like jumping into a normal swimming pool XD
yes, mozilla's engine.
14Ohai

07lol
5I dunno, I wouldn't mind living in Austria. It's a beautiful country.
5But of course I'd have to research it and all that jazz...

I have a question, why would someone hate scientists?
omg I know right
I saw that and I was like whaaaaat
I was reading a post on the forums, and someone said they hate scientists
03o.o
maybe being a missionary like you stated maybe he automatically relates science to scientology or something like that idk
Scientology?
then again that'd be kind of like racism don't you think?
03power may go out
-.o
03storm
Racist to whom?
Stupid people?
ah
Please, that's shouldn't even be considered a religion
I know
:P
Scientology was created by a science fiction writer who a few people took seriously
14Getting my hair cut next week though so all good
but he gets worked up over stuff like that
so
just a theory
12D:
/me steals the storm
They're mad
lolage
12I really want a bad storm to happen here
12xD
It didn't even become a religion until after he died, almost a hundred years later.
14And oh wow, I DID catch the sun today!
And seeing how you need to pay to get in?
Like a ridiculous amount
wasn't my point but I'll let you ramble about it lol
Good thing we don't get that here
03XD
I still don't even know how these presidents are elected here...

No, but there are huge-ass bugs
7oh yeah. it's always on the news.

Watch Jurassic Park II, for those who were wondering.
hahahahha
I know, heard about that. Grisly details.
I have Jurassic Park 1 2 & 3
^ My hero
Next year I get to travel to Rwanda =P
Plus extra footage
D: Extra?
7that's velociraptor central
Rwanda?

Okay, that's not even Jurassic Park related!
wb RP4L
/me 5's back.
5Thanks. ^^
7take notes from this guy http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/velociraptors.jpg
Are velociraptors warm-blooded? Or cold-blooded?
It is now... :)
*Were
whats up
I believe they would be cold-blooded, though their apparent avairy roots might have made them warm-blooded.
*aviary
Anyways...
What are you guys doing at the moment?
I'mduct-taping babies to my ceiling and watching them squirm. Yourself?
I'm setting fire to Casinos
Rob them of their greed
We robbed them of their land already...

Azure: You are attracted to 5Gorebyss
Same with Eskimos to Inuits.
12o.o;
And he said Indian
12Can't Gorebyss only be female?
If one guys says it, he represents the whole race?
12xDD
have you never been informed of this before
No, but then I looked online
you say that like it's a bad thing
that's what they get in return is money from running casinos
A casino is such odd compensation, lol.
12orly
For a people who didn't even use money, they sure see a lot of it now.
I like being called by my first name
because you said you didn't understand
I already said... Nevermind
:P
7says you
:p
I'm not even annoyed

I'm on fire
If I'm gonna annoy him, I need a good reason :p

12I walked down a street where the houses were numbered 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K and 1MB. That was a trip down memory lane.
actually
Don't contradict me... Bad things happen to people who contradict me...
Just in case I actually fall asleep XD
Ever hear of the Albino lifegaurd?
5wut.
14lol
7Gerple? Flamey?
He contradicted me, so I turned him into a contradiction...
12One for the geeks XD
14XD
It was funny because Albino's can't go out into the sun :p
14Anyway i'll be back later, going to have a lie down
12I currently own a system which is exactly 14 times better than Windows 7. I call it: Windows 98.
14Got a rotten headache again x-x
03o..o
I do believe I'm on fire
If i don't come back it'll be because I've gone to sleep XD, so yeh if that happens I'll speak to ya'll tomorrow

Naw, I'll just respawn after I die
What game you playing?
12Wow xD
Team Fortress 2
I wish though
I'm quoting the Spy
Ahh, crap I forgot to download that yesterday
7that reminds me
Just came out for Mac yesterday, so now I can play it on high detail without needing to use crossover
7I have a question. how do mac users make orange portals?
...
That's an old joke, we've had 2 mouse buttons for years
7sure
Has anyone seen my legs?
03XD
yeah
saw them down by applebee's
bah, that medicine is horrible
:D
/me dashes after his legs impossibly.
Wait... What?
Lol?
never happened
7yes it did
alright then keep making stuff up lol
7it was back when the censor was on, because homo was blocked out and dari seperated the word so everyone would know what he was talking about
I'll eventually get TF2
whatever makes you feel happy I guess idk
7you're really shit at defending yourself you know?
7it's actually kinda entertaining
I don't really feel the need to defend myself if I don't remember it/if it's not the truth
4Defend against what?
7she's denying the time she banned dari for saying homosapien
4Oh yeah
4I remember that
if I'm wrong then oh well
4you used to tweek whenever someone said hom
4homo*
I trust my memory, because I know EVERYTHING
:D
7I find it funny when n00bs try to do the know-all thing
I find it funny how you don't know sarcasm
Why yes I do
:P
7then you can predict the future. tell me what next week's lottery numbers are
I have the power of Omniscience!
I am unable to tell you that, for if I do, your brain waves will be slightly different, altering the molecules in the universe and make the lottery numbers different.
7Hardly.
7My brain waves, mighty as they are, cannot change the lottery numbers
*mean knowing
One of my favourite albums
7I know the whole temporal butterfly effect comes in, but only if they're even remotely connected
did you know there was a beer in Germany being called "Bit" ?
Every single motion you do creates vibrations, and the smallest vibrations change the energy in the computers that generate the number ever so slightly, but enough to create a difference
Well, that's almost a pun, since you are, in theory, connected to your personal temporal string.
a friend of mine recommended a vendor to sell it in an 8-pack instead of a sixpack. It should be called: "Gimmie a Byte"
Ask me a question, any question!
7shush Neot. your bullshit is terrible
12Heh 8 bit
What is Trent Reznor's name? :P
what I said, yeah
Trent Reznor
*change
7ah. I see.
Trent Reznor does not exist. He is actually Will Smith in disquise.
LOL
Shit!
Everything I know is wrong!
^ No, will smith. There's a difference.
No it isn't
Ah, too late.
You know how to speak english
We know he can write in English, however.
Am not...Oh bugger
I know that for sure, because I have Omniscience
Ask me another question
Who am I?
What colour is my undewear?
What am Iistening to now?
underoos
New Keep of Kalessin and God Is An Astronaut is out now
I like the name of the latter.
Speaking of humanoid
genetic engineers and find cures to 3 different cancers.
The new Tokio Hotel is shit
LOL tokio hotel
my god
I prefer their old stuff
He used a dictionary
7you know, considering the population of each region is about 200, there's only around 1500 people in the entire PokÃ©mon world
The new Keep of Kalessin is quite good but the new GIAA is a little disappointing
I was hoping he wouldn't.
Want to ask me another question?
It's difficult to describe from an unaided standpoint.
I know the answer your gonna say
I gave an airborne feces...
7airborne doesn't really equate to flying. with airborne, you could just be levitating whilst 'flying' implies forward motion
If that happens you're gonna suffer
I won't suffer, I know I won't.
But he's actually a metal musician
But in his mind he likes rock music the best.
There is a significant difference
Lol, I checked the dictionary, and they used what to describe the word what. xD
Yes
He just decided to become a metal musician because the cash flow is almost 12% greater. Though due to bad analysis, he believes it is almost an 18% difference.
:P
:D.
The one thing I like more than symmetry is accuracy
Another problem I have with dictionaries is that if someone doesn't understand the word 'what', they most likely won't know the deinfition of "interoggatively" either.
Hey everybody
I know I spelled that incorrectly, but screw it.
LOL
So what now?
I guess that was funny.
Didn't realize.
Music: A library of sound that uses a collection of 4 or 3 beats. Tempo is used to generate the frequency of each beat, which is what each note gets played on or between.
What about the drummers who's beats go up to 7?
That is exactly 4+3
They use alternations between 4 beats and 3 beats
I'm blind
No you are not. I know you aren't.
I'm typing in brail
*braille
:P
You are reading what I am typing, and brail machines can not translate javascript
So try another excuse
I know, I am just in my "Literal" mode right now :P
Heh
Then again, I know everything...
I know what you did last summer...
Meaning of life?
42
Next question
Nice
You got that from The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy...Good movie
/me 5revives the Chat.
No
12Hi
12LOL
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy got it from me.
5It had diiiiiied.
:P
I told them about it.
Heh
Next question.
12o-O
/me rawrs
Hmmm
12It's exam season >v<
12I hope after that people will be more active lol
Chicken or the egg?
Egg
activeness
The lunatic who came up with the question
Your mother
XD
5Really?
XD
5Oh, well, I suppose not all schools have gotten out yet.
Oh I'm offended XD
Next question
/me 5had her exams two weeks ago.
/me downloads moar games
Am I really offended?
No
Next question
Correct
12In England schools don't leave for Summer hols till July
12Near end of July
12Ra
12hmm
/me gives Azure a hotdog o-o
5When's the school year start?
/me now has a hotdog. o.o
You will give me another question soon. I know you will
Though I now created a paradox, albite not a time paradox
12Hooray
12xD
lol
Where did he sod off to?
Yes
The paradox was felt by the server, so I was kicked off
Next question?
I had that problem last night
12September
Your kick was due by a buffer overflow in the net message packet that was sent.
12and I cannot believe I only just found this out but you know the big mural that Aurora was painting in her school?
I know it was, because I know everything...
I know what you did last summer...
What was it?
that I did
And because this chatroom hates Chrome
5Uh.. no?
12x33
12Nevermind, don't worry
Or you could not use Mibbit
:P
5No, what about it?
You and your friends were coming home from a party. The road was slippery because of the rain that morning.
Lies
hi Arti
Suddenly, a man fell from the hill above, and your car ran him over
12Well, basically she won an art competition and she got to paint a mural on a plaque like thing outside her school
12I'll get the photo of it quick
5Oh, awesome!
hmm...
But what you did not know is that he is still alive, and knows where you live.
HOI2DDA or downloading?
12Anyway
or JVS?
downloading
heya Alt
12Apparently it hadn't even been up three hours before some people rode their bikes over it and made tyre marks
He will be killing your friends, saving you for last.
Hey
Sounds nothing like what I did last summer actually
:P
omfg the connection at the apartment is awesome <#
its an Altair~
<3
But good guess
5Aw man.
5I love the mural though!
Currently, he is still planning, but he will initiate it on the exact day that you ran him over.
5It's so awesome.
12Yeh I know but now it's ruined, how friggin terrible is that?!
5I know. ;;
12She spent like over a week on it I think
One of your friends will die in an elevator, by "Faulty Cable". Another will be shot by a gun that was booby trapped in his closest
5I painted a freaking /box/ (like a cardboard refrigerator box) back in April and it still looks fine.. Then again it's in the garage.
[Altair] 3[Altair] 4[Altair] 5[Altair] 6[Altair] 7[Altair] 8[Altair] 9[Altair]
5I spent about a week on that thing to... But gosh.. What an honour, and what a shame it got ruined so quickly@
5**!
Your last friend, who you got into a fight with last spring and haven't spoken to each other since, will be run over by a car.
So far, it's behaving itself
5Mine was just random crap on a box for a charity event. xD;
12lol
/me rawrs at alti
Altair
5Lemmee see if I can find a photo.
I found the stupidest web comic in the world...
5MRAAH the photographer only took a picture of one side. ><
12D:
:D
hi Arti
No, even worse...
Two Kinds...
12Aww damn I just remembered I made a biro sketch of an Articuno in mountains today at work but I left it in my drawer
12I was actually really proud of it, it came out good.
5Aw. D:
:/
hihi
/me rawrs back :o
5Hey BF.
hi BF
hihi
12LOL
Anyone play the .hack games?
heh
12RP4L is on TeamSpeak!
you scared yourself with your own rawr
Nope
Two Kinds is funny
But my faves are 8-Bit Theatre, Looking For Group and JTHM
5Yeah.
5But I'm not hooked up.
Two Kinds is like a freaking porno. I hate it.
5I forgot to close that down. xD
Look up Order of the Stick
I remember dpx used to be obsessed with Two Kinds
idkwtf it is but it's some sort of furry thing right
5My mike is downstairs gaaah.
12I just ran to get my mic XD
Sorta...
JTHM is great
5I could go get it...
Very twisted but funny
It was made by Jhonen Vasquez
12Ok but I wont say much ^^ not unless we have a group of people
:O I love Yoshi Island!
and the fact that I found the portable GBA version is just awesome
12Im hugnry
12*hungry
/me feeds Arti a cookie D:
5How come no one ever goes on TS? It's such a cool program.
TS?
5TeamSpeak.
never heard of it
5xD
5It's on the front TST page...
12LOL
12It's because everyone here is shy ^^ honest
5Ooohhh.
12Most of the regulars have it as far as I know
yeah, i'm a shy floofburd
5But it's so neat~ o3o
5No one here in NE has an accent. ><
what's it all about?
5(No, seriously. We speak like the dictionary.)
5It's kind of like international calling.
eh?
5Except you all get on the channel and you can use microphones to talk to each other.
so it's like chatting.... but with a microphone?
XD
03hxhxha
odd....
03damnit, missed her
12It's voice chat!
5I LOVE TECHNOLOGY.
5<3
I can't do this anymore...
12So RP4L, can you hear me ok?
I am the worst artist in the world
i know, but I like private voice chats... not public ones ^^;;
D;
5Uh, I can't hear anything Arti.
12Not at the moment
12But earlier?
5No, wasn't plugged in.
12Not even to speakers? XD
5My sound wasn't on!
12Ok
5(I don't leave the volume on.)
12Lets try now
but it sounds kinda cool... just to speak to someone, instead of type
lol
5I saw the light.
So am I
XD
12Didnt hear anything?
So I write instead
5This is bizarre. D:
12Ah my fault
12Need to setup mic properly
I can write fine, but I can't "Write" a game model...
5Oh. xD
Haha
If I could, then I would do that.
i don't even know how to use my mic on my laptop XD
ask infa z when he comes on
I'm a pretty good artist, just have trouble finding good outlets for making my ideas real.
5I can hear you now LOL.
I would prefer not to show people what I am doing until I get it done
12I dont know what to say ^^ told you I'm shy
5But it's a little fuzzy.
5Oh, ha.
12Ok let me try MOAR settings
I was looking for someone to give me a good game design though, because if I could just get some assets, I can make a game that doesn't completely suck
5Better.
12haha thanks
12You're impossible to hear :3
5Augh.
12lawl
5I have the mic sensitivity down all the way.
07lol
5>< I need to raid my dad's stuff for an actual MICROPHONE.
12Mine is set to "Push to talk"
12how charming
12I set the middle mouse button as my talk button
5I have a laptop, haha, no mouse for me.
I can't wait for Unity 3
12RP4L, if you just wanna sit there and listen to everyone, you can actually text chat in the program as well
12You can set any button as the voice activation
5It doesn't let me actually. ><
12Xai has it set to Control
5Text message I mean.
12Doesm't let you send a message to all?
Unity 3?
I heard about that coming out
5Noope.
A game engine
12Try right clicking where it says "Default" above our names
5OH I see now.
Yes?
Its got really good cross platform support.
/me licks
Adobe Air is cool too.
12mmm wetness :
12P
Adobe Air?
But air is not new.
5o-o
I have yet to see Air do anything impressive
Air is basically a runtime for flash/html/css/js
'-'
12okay what's with the face
whatever you want to stick in it.
I know what it is
12go back to your teamspeak :P
I just don't think it's really cool
So you can make flash games or whatever and export to air.
I'm not on teamspeak...
12You should be :D
oh
5xP
I don't really care for Flash/HTML5/Javascript/Any other simple online game platform.
If one of those got built in support for WebGL? I will be happy.
And I mean good WebGL support, like Quake Live or InstantAction
how do you download the Team Speak?
!define teamspeak
-!- TeamSpeak is proprietary Voice over IP software that allows users to speak on a chat channel with other users, much like a telephone conference ...
Lots of great games were made in flash.
12Google for it?
5You can go to the TST front page and go down to "TST TeamSpeak".
5And go from there.
5(That too.)
i did... and ok, I'll google it
Air so far has been mainly used for simple applications.
What great games were made in flash?
The best game I've seen was Machinerium
Or however you spell it.
Bloons tower defense
is pretty awesome
12Im starving
12Im gonna go look for food, seeya later
04morning
5See ya Arti.
I don't care for AddictingGames/Miniclip/Armorgames
04heya
hey
Then you don't care for browser based games.
I mean, I am impressed at the market for them, but the individual games I am not impressed with.
No, I like some browser based games.
Quake-Live and all the InstantAction games are fun.
I dont play a lot of flash games, but theres a few that are pretty good.
Well I am not saying that all the flash games suck, they just aren't my particular taste.
I know millions and millions of people like them.
do i download a client or a server?
03ihhi
The Unity plugin is pretty sweet
/me nvms and does is later
If I wanted to make a browser based game id probably use that.
Looks simple enough.
12Switching to laptop
Damn, so many things I need to learn. Flash, whatever language Unity uses....
7you played hello worlds?
...
7http://www.kongregate.com/games/richwsnider/hello-worlds
/me noms a biscuit
no whats that?
Unity has an awesome plugin
04hi Sneas
I just wish Unity had a better rendering layer, it's still using an outdated GL library
And unity uses C++
I think you can use javascript too
Unless you mean the scripting language, in which case they have multiple scripting layers to support Python, LUA, and a few others
Its all syntax
Pretty much
The coding language is pure C++, but the scripting languages are pretty flexible
What about the Wintermute Engine?
That's actually the main reason I use to use Unity
never ehard of it.
Never tried it
Wait, Wintermute? I don't think that's a game engine, I think that's just a rendering engine
I like lazy languages like php.
Lol
Unity is cool because of all the platforms you can export for.
I try to stay with the C-syntax languages
Wintermute Engine Development Kit is a set of tools for creating and running graphical "point & click" adventure games, both traditional 2D ones and modern 2.5D games (3D characters on 2D backgrounds). The kit includes the runtime interpreter (Wintermute Engine, or WME) and GUI editors for managing and creating the game content (WME tools) as well as the docu
They are adding android support in 3, thats why I wana try it.
The game engine I am using at the moment is Torque
How hard is it to use?
Not a very flexible scripting layer, but it's rendering layer is powerful enough to beat the Unreal engine
Which is REALLY saying something
Indeed
Unless you are only using it for very simple games, in which case without the source code it's $250
....he did it again
Ive got torque here
Or if you have the internet...Free
Torque3d? Or just TGE/A
Game engines aren't something you can torrent like music
Who said anything about Torrents?
the torque sdk?
Or pirate bay
Or anything similar
12Ra
the torque sdk?
Yes

I pretty much managed the entire pets department for the last hour and a half
torquepowered.com
Oh cool
whats goin on
The manager had to leave early or something
They really did give you walmart mod powers
I think I'm fine for now, thanks :D
Heres a guide for starting with torque: http://rapidshare.com/files/138600732/EGTGE.zip
nothin really
Lol
People say its good.
Thank you
Apparently everyone's impressed with what I'm doing
it's really crazy in spyrochat
I have yet to find a game engine that can beat Torque3D
hmm
Working at Walmart?
Yeah
people keep talking about making flash games
Oh God how boring
whos flashin who?
:D
/me wishes certain people were here
raise?
It's not as horrible as you might think
you only get a raise every year after your eval
They keep you pretty busy so it's not boring
*evaluation
/me makes certain people appear
oh
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I won't get a raise
I need to go buy some laptops today... probably wont make it to town though...
Ever
laptops as in plural?
Since I'm only temporary until I go back to school
maybe a promotion
:P
true
Again, temporary
Why multiple laptops?
a temporary promotion :P
Lol
Ive bought like 7 of those
/me needs to take a shower, brb
o.O
they are awesome.
I wanna work at the music store in Reading
What do you need 7 of the same laptop for?
7? Holy crap
(red-ing)
They haven't failed me yet.
SR, why did you get 7 of the same laptops?
Because they are good.
I buy them and set them up for customers.
Oh that's the kind my mom has
Ohh, for work
ah
hers is really slow though
sr is a middle man?
futureshop should give me a discount.
Anyone know where I can get a decent HMD for <$500?
whats HMD
Head Mounted Display
Preferably monocular
On like VR goggles
Sort of
Not quite
I dont know then.
do they sell vr goggles for computers?
Yes
But they aren't called VR goggles
hmm..
Search for Head Mounted Display
hmd we
awesome
/me sits all over Articuno
I bought a beagleboard and installed a stripped version of Ubuntu on it
Can't find a good HMD for it though to carry around
sounds like the perfect ingredient for the recipe of being a vegetable
...XD
Umm...
What?
beagleboard is too expensive for me
That must have flown over my head
Gumstix is smaller
It's only $150 though
Id probably get an Arduino
having head mounted display makes me think being stuck in the virtual world and dissociating oneself from reality
of course i'm exaggerating
I saw the gumstix, but the drivers sucked and had no DVI output
they have breakout boards for that.
gumstix is for size, if your carrying stuff around
That ruins the purpose of a single board though
Tape em together
...
apparently
lol, yeah
Didn't even notice
Me either
Are they?
he said a few things when I came in
and then became suddenly quiet
Well I gotta get back to my model, I still suck at it...
Arti, did you read what I wrote in the thread about Pokewalkercheat?
well, I actually don't know what they're talking about now
it's all over my head
12LOL
12Just replied that second
I know AS2 and AS3.
I'm trying to find that laptop in a store where I won't have to pay for shipping
i didnt hear anytihng about flash but its more or less baout computers.. again
whats as3?
that one you linked to
lol yeah
Action Script 3.
oh
we don't have futureshops around here
It's the language used in Flash.
you can drive to canada and buy it.
you should know I'm partly a dark, but also partly a pure one
Lol
i think it might be a futureshop exclusive
ah
check out shopping.hp.com
I've been told it's a lot like Java.
7I was playing some flash game that's now annoyed me
they probably have a similar model
is adobe flash used for it
that would explain why I can't find it anywhere
Yes.
12You have no idea how sad I am infact, this is the big one.
and I really wished I would have the time
12I wish there was something we could do
Have you ever used Java before?
usually the stores around here get "exclusive" models that are all the same so they dont have to pricematch anyone else.
nope
just a different model number.
I've done a little bit of Java.
heh - nothing in fact. It's just a work-weekend
and a big one, too
yeah, my mom has one just like that
I don't know if the specs are the same though
it just looks alike
12I've offered RN and Burnett a room too so they can stay the extra day
Hm
what's the model number?
brb
k
Actually, brb too
HP Pavilion dv6500
well, maybe it's delayed, but it's not forgotten. I WILL come and see your house. That's a promise
i got a hp dv6
12^v^
its pretty good
mine's a dv4
I like it a lot
i like mine
except its not for much gaming
same here
but that's fine with me
I prefer console gaming anyway
lol
/me tries to drag Nick online
Haha, I just checked, a noughts and crosses game I made earlier is ~1400 lines of code. XD I've never been very good with keeping things small.
XD
i sorta want to get a gaming laptop so i can go anywhere with it and play games
HP envy
my CS professor wouldn't like that
ive heard the hp envy was a bit over priced for what it was
i dunno
actually, the envy is a bit too pricy, you could probably find something with power for less
it did catch my eye
It is a nice machine.
yeah
the envy 13 is a nice little notebook
i was sorta eyeing the envy 14 coming out
get something with core i7 though
i did like the concept of the slice battery
Yeah, but some of it is copy/paste with a couple things changed, because I couldn't be bothered to make a univseral function that would work for all of it.
i was thinking core i3 for battery life
yes the battery was done really well
you need more power for gaming.
i think they have i7 ULV now.
yeah but most of it comes from the gpu
that's exactly why he'd hate it XD
it really depends on the game though
he hates duplicate code
yeah you need a good gpu too.
I learned that the hard way
:P
12damn he's gone to bed
the alien ware m11 can play crysis and mw2 and it only has the ulv core duo with 1.3 ghz and it runs smoothly with those games
Well, it doesn't lag and the end file size is 137 KB, so I don't care. :P
Alienware became horrible after they were bought out by dell
Well, the .swf
yeah i heard
mw2 is supprisingly light on resources
crysis is definalty more resource intensive.
Sorry, didn't mean to intrude on your conversation, just had to say it
but the m11 is one of a kind currently
Crysis is a joke whenever a new GPU comes out.
People always ask "But how well can it play Crysis?"
/me pokes chat v_v
crysis is a good benchmark.
Been playing around with the 3D options on CS4, it's quite cool.
It's like a meme on Engadget
12The time I decide to be active, everyone else is dead
although Just Cause 2 has better graphics.
The new crysis looks sweet in the trailer.
Haha, I don't think there even are 3D options on Elements
Elements is Photoshop?
yeah
Or is that just the suite name?
i dont think there are 3d options for that
you can check out something called mudbox that is a 3d image creator
it's a version of photoshop
elements I mean

I am gonna buy Windows 7 just for that game =P
12...
12THEY DID THAT ON PURPOSE
Oh cool
did you ever finish that brick breaker game?
/me rampages
Nah, I do a bit of something, then come back to it at a later date. XD
lol
usually laptops come with 5400rpm or something.
it makes a big difference.
what speed would a ssd be compared to the regular hard drives
12lol
very fast.
but not cheap.
i know
12....
there are cheap ssds out now but you can't cheap out on them
you need to pay for a good one if you want perfomance.
!reset
are there any cons to a ssd?
other than the price
:P
Expensive and small storage space
yaeh
mmm I think they fixed most of the problems with drive failures
aside from the price
so if youve got the money to spend you should be good.
12Oh ha ha ha-dee-haa....... ¬¬
intel has some 80gb ones
I thought you said CoD would work on my netbook
ill jsut wait for the price to come down on them
I got a RAID 0 of 4 128GB SSDs
:P
I forgot which one is the best brand...
it may and again it may not
hey, I am still alive...
well....a bit at least
/me searches for his pulse
just need more demand.
err....yeah, still there
strong and steady
like i said... the game was made for computers 10 years ago

I'm going out for pizza with my dad, bbl
cya
bye
bring me a slice
haha, and you get a slice of cold pizza in the mail a few days later
ha
03o.o
he can just stick it in the mic... ill pull it through the other end
/me appears in a puff of logic - "Note to Self: Never go to Staples again."
haha
what the fish is Staples?
03an office supply store
oi my brother was wanting me to get him something from new egg the other day
03I actually like Staples, better than Office Max or Office Depot
I buy all my computer stuff from newegg
03but that could just be because my mom's friends with like half the employees LOL
its pretty good site.
well, we're getting everything from Corporate Express
you said there are ulv i7 didn't you?
and yes, that's really the actual name of it
I thought there was but maybe there isn't.
I dislike Staples because the clerk was giving a "Derp?" face when I needed to get new ink for my typewriter.
12I applied for a job in Staples once XD
thats 3.5 hour battery life.
rated at.
03speaking of jobs
hmm
03apparently my mom got me a job
thatd be awsome
03she was talking to a guy who runs a local computer place
03and he said he'd hire me
03to do computer work for the summer
03^
03*^^
My battery life is like an hour
with your netbook
?
Is getting hired by the local computer place a good or bad thing?
yeah
12Wow
dam...
03it sounds easy enough
12You just dont get jobs that way over here LOL
with mine it could be anywhere from 8-5
03he told my mom they have people who 'fix' computers that have viruses and then install the software on them
the more munnie$ the better
I just leave it plugged in all the time so it doesn't matter
03if that's what they had me do
03that would be insanely easy
8? o.o
An hour? That's pretty poor.
03not to mention while Windows is installing, phone IRC
thats the same with my dv6
/me hides
03well
03I applied the normal way
12yay lol!
03and didn't hear back from anybody
12Ah..
my hp can get aroudn 5 hours on powersaving mode easy
03but my mom really wants me to get a job (she probably just wants me out of the house >_>)
yeah 8 or so it says on the estimate thing
03she's currently at a golf outing with my sister
My gateway's battery is shot.
The closest I've got to a job is fixing the a standalone network at my old high school.
fair nuff
03and apparently one of my sister's friend's dads was talking to her
I get maybe 45 minutes. Needs a new battery.
03about using summer interns
03and my mom mentioned having a son who was into computers
you english-speaking people would call this "Vitamin R" then ;)
(Mr. Kwar... please don't send the Grade 10s to fix it when it breaks... call me. Before I have to rebuild it all...)
Normal batteries should last 5-8 hours. A good battery lasts 10, and a really great battery lasts 12. Poor batteries are less then 5
Or at least that's how it is in my mind
oh yeah sr... whats better the atom dual core or the ulv core duo
Core duo
ok
Get an i5 dual core
R stands for "R"elations
03XD
03my mom is good at that stuff
03since she's a psycho-logist
03she knows like, everybody
Unless you are talking netbook
Theres a lot of i3 laptops out there now.
Then get an i3
Ninja'd
most of teh core i processores are dual core arnt they
Intel's modern core 2 duos are pretty decent.
12!reset
!reset
i dont hear much of anything about amd anymore
I would dearly suck at public relations or human resources type jobs...
Lol.
03same
03which is why I refused to apply for a job at a grocery store
Hehe
lol no, none of those pictures are me
03I don't want to bag groceries or whatever
03that's just boring and tedious
lol
drf: like life?
03I was like hmm, a job at somewhere like Best Buy or Radio Shack would be fine
/me hides
03of course they never called me >_>
id laugh so hard if you said yes
03LOL
Also, PR and HR jobs would mean I can't swear when something annoying/bad happens. :P
03my life isn't tecious and boring at all
03I don't swear though
03so I don't care about htt
03*that
Yeah, the profile picture is totally me
i wouldnt figure you to wear a chainmail bra
drf: rejected by Best Buy?
I walk around wearing a chain-mail bra all the time
lol
...
My main problem is I'm a through and through techie... when morons bring me a computer to fix, and I need to clear virii becuase of their browsing habits... I usually spend about an hour swearing continuously. All of which are not repetitive. :P
It was sarcasm dude
You did?
03Brother, yeah >_>
XD
03I'm probably too good for them
/me runs
LOL
D:
03I really hate Best Buy as a store, they bait-and-switch their customers
XD
People always think I'm a guy, hahahaha
03thre are lots of articles about it on slashdot and such
inb4: Worst Buy
03where they sell you crappy computers, then make you pay to make them 'faster'
7then again, everyone always thinks I'm a girl so I can hardly talk
03which is them just putting MORE software on it
I assume everyone on the internet is a guy until I find out otherwise
and then you'd be a instrument of their evil? :p
its the interwebs... there are no such things as gurls here
03but if I got a job at Best Buy, I'd probably just ask to sell TVs or something
03and not computers
Unless their name ends in 'a'
well I've had it on my Spyroforum profile since... forever
03I WANTED to be a Geek Squad technician
lol thats the same thing i said to her when we met
03I probably know as much if not more than any of those people
03but eh
7my cat is sat directly behind my chair whining for food but I can't move or I'll break her leg...
03sadly without certification, everyone thinks you're a n00b
I guess those things are kind of hard to notice though
that reminds me of the GEEK thing from that show
7Dari: so did SR
Lol.
The little pink gender icon in the corner

12But I can;'t remember it in detail anymore
most random conversation ever...
Hmm, fine I'll settle with that.

12July 4th is the TST meet
/me hides
03LOL
that means I'll be able to play in just a bit
Lol, I'd burn it.
:P

03I should totally come to that meet and start shooting off fireworks
03Yes it is
12Come on now, admit that its a STUPID law
Only if you get caight
03I can burn a British flag all I want
/me runs
03Articuno, most laws in most countries are stupid
03like, copyrights
/me runs faster
03like WTF
03It's illegal to copy a DVD you legally own
03that's just retarded
So
12Well yeh, the TV license law for example
by law
you are...a pirate :P
03Yes.,
04it is surprisingly fun to kill creatures with 1500hp with only a level 1 rocket launcher and a leverl 2 pulse blaster
04[/nerd]
03I often joke that I'd owe like, more money than exists in the world plus a few hundred life sentences if I were to get caught
12What game you referring to?
03because of that 5 years in prison per movie thing LOL
<3@ victory parade
12XD
cool
drf: you'd be in there for eternity then XD
i'm not really in the mood to play right now though
I owe money mostly to adobe, but their products are over priced. :o
03apparently, the RIAA and MPAA say that the pirated movie downloads are costing the movie companies about 300 times the amount of money that exists on the planet
03which is just stupid :P
we'll see you in the next melliniumm then
04@Arti I'm playing Spore
03EW SPORE
12That,,....
It's only a couple programs, yet I owe them more than £2000.
03er no
03more like
04Spore is awesome
03EW DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
12Is the most ridiculous sum I've EVER heard
03Articuno, I'm not kidding
03you know how they say there's a fine of like $500,000 per movie or something?
03in the FBI warnings?
12LOOOL
03add those up XD
Lyon: you killing other creatures to become dominant?
03I'm serious, it says up to $500,000 and 5 years in jail
03for copying a movie
03>_>
12I got bored of Spore at the civilisation stage ^^;
04@Brother no, I'm randomly killing my creations in the Adventure maker for fun
04LOL ARTI
drf: the FBI will only get you if you DARE to say J Edger Hoover is stupid
03like, they've sued people like $10,000 for downloading like 20 sopngs
03*songs
/me dies
03LOL
04Get to Space stage and it is really fun
03Nah
12I dont have time now
04well
04that's understandable
04but yeah
03what I do for my own personal use is my business
12Like right now Im too busy on IRC and tonight I'll probably play SS
04its a really fun game once you get to Space stage
03as for me sending music to people... nobody in here works for the FBI, do they?
arti: thats why Spore can't beat Civ IV in civilization :P
/me looks aroud
03*around
12lol
04lol
No, the FBI hates me unoffically :p
:/ sucks.
sorry
03why, for being a Communist?
now I have to get used to the mouse too.. <.<;
12I also lost interest a bit when I found out they'd completely re-made spore from what it was supposed to be originally
its like. overly sensitive.
why the mouse?
03I tend to live by "laws aren't a rule, just a suggestion
That, and many other things
/me hides
got a new one of those since my left mouse button was way too hard to click.
I actually like the
03Like that time I was going 100mph down the road
really hurt my finger after a while
04AWW WHAT
lol
i see
12I suggest you don't murder that person XD
03LOL
george carlin comment on rights :P
03Well obviously I wouldn't murder people
04This stupid thing jumped and the Rocket Launcher didn't stun it
03That's common sense
12Xai hit 130mph at his fastest

03I was just super late to pick up my sisters
12and LOL DRF

12Glitches, never spotted many
04well
03the worst thing about Spore is DRM -__

12OMG YEH

03for installing it on two computers
04it mainly happend in Galactic Adventures expansion

12God I need to get back to bed at normal times, stupid late shifts
12!cynder
04I want to test if it works here
04sweet
12WHAT THE HELL
12LOL
I worked out a better way to do mIRC scripts with colours. :o
04I'm a huge Cynder fanboy
12ahh
04^^
12Weird, because of Cynder the old chat member
04lol
04I know
Lyon: does that mean you also have that old yet new spyro game series? :p
04lol
04yeah
04I have TEN and DotD
heard they are making a movie
I kind of gave up on DotD.
DotD bascially ended the series
And the Spyro film is being made by the same people who did Eragon, so I wouldn't expect much.
a 'happy ever after'
arg..Eragon
I didnt even think the movie and book were related at first
04ARGH ERAGON MOVIE
04that was terrible
/me gives Quilava a cookie
Yeah, most people I speak to on other servers prefer the old Spyro series anyway.
04I much preffered the book
04nah
04I like the new ones
the old were classic
04...probably considering the only old gen-Spyro game I've playing is Ripto's Rage
And pretty much all of them hate Cynder the most out of the new series. :P
12hi
04wut
/me squeaks?
04Cynder is awesome
/me goes on a fanboy rant
Well, there are about 500 users with Cynder in their name to be fair.
/me shot
the new..well they REALLY changed sypro's personality
But most of them typ lik ths nd r rlly annoyng
Damn, wish I could help my friend with that protest
04lol
sure
huh? :|
12My mum's a noob
I am... Partly done with the head of my model
04lol
12on her facebook, she wanted photos of me on profile so she went and tagged herself in all my photos D:
04lolwut
And it might not turn out to be sucky!
/me doesn't use Facebook so :P
^
I don't use any social networking sites, I don't like them.
04I just don't see what's so great about it
/me watches Labor demonstration of 77
04people at school just say 'Because its awesome'
12Facebook isn't exactly like the rest, I use it to talk to my family and stuff
04I hate generalised answers like that >.>
04well
12It just lets family know what you're up to
04I don't have much family I don't have direct contact with
04and my sister has FB so
I just don't see the point, I think if I want to meet up with them, or talk to them, I'll call them.
04so does my mum
04._.
04hurr
12I mean like, Nick doesn't have facebook and he had no idea that me and Xai were moving house and one day I was like "Oh and about the house" and he was like "wait what?"
04lol
12and everyone else I know keeps up to date on what I'm doing by my status updates
04I have a phone
04but i never use it
04like
04NEVER
Lyon: wut
you have a phone but dont use it?
04yup
D:
04I take it with me every now and then so my parents can contact me
But there's time for facebook? How does that work...?
04but other than that I never use it
04Arti is on the computer right now
mine is mostly texting or calling people
04that means there is time for FB
12Eg. My mum sometimes goes out and if she's out at this time of night and Im at home, I can just update whats happened and she'll see it when she has time
and during work there is no time
12Plus everyone else will see it :/ rather than ringing every single person to tell them "I found a really rare bird today"
12It's just little life updates that people want to see all at once
04ah
04well
04my life is boring
04Facebook status: "I talked to Xeli today on mIRC. We talked about stuff"
I've got to much to do
12LMAO
04B|
12It's not like a journal, a journal is more personal
..whats the minimum ammount of cards in a deck for magic?
12Facebook is more like just updating everyone with cool stuff
12About you
04...
04I'M NOT COOL
was it 40?
04[/pessimism]
12not just that but everyone can discuss it on your page
12a bit like a forum
/me pats Lyon and gives him a cool cookie
04I am a member of a forum already
12So if I said I saw a really rare bird or something, all my fellow birdwatchers would be talking about it to me and each other
04it's called The Sky Temple of Lugia and Articuno
04I thought you might have heard of it
12The thing about Facebook is that yes, a great deal of people use it
04because its addicting
12So thats what makes it so easy to stay in touch
04for some odd reason
12Just think of it like a big forum for all your close friends and family
04well
12though if you dont do anything with your life like you just said, there isnt muich point XD
04a large part of my life (i.e. my internet life) I keep hidden from my family because they'd go 'ZOMG YOU'RE SO CHILDISH'
12But I live far from all my family and friends
04:|
04I should so make a FB
12some people dont need Facebook, I'd say you were one of them, you go to school, see your friends every day, speak online to your other friends and you see your family all the time
04just to change my status to 'MY LIFE IS BORING'
12lol
04or 'I went to school today.'
04'Reagan likes this'
/me shot
Lyon: or "i played spore today"
XD
04lol Brother
04'I killed my creation in Spore for the 53rd time. I feel cruel'
/me burns Reagan's coffin to make sure he doesnt turn into a zombie o3o
04...
04talk about foresight
04also Arti

04you do know I have a dA right?

04lolno Brother
04I killed my OTHER creation 53 times with ym Captain
12No i dont

04well

12I dont use it
04:|
04why is that?
12Dont need to or want to
04oh
04not much time for art is there?
12Nope
apparently my job starts Monday at 9am LOL
04lol drf
I like sleeping in :(
12Is it 9-5 then?
whatever
probably
drf: now your old self dies and a new begins to life :p
SR, do you know which is better in Windows: Pixel shading in DirectX or Pixel shading in OpenGL
12What he said
LOL
hopefully the new one wont die inbetween the transfer...
04lol
12I'm lucky, I start at 10am and I only live 20 mins from work so I can get up at 9am if I want XD
if it does...well you can see reagen again :D

No kick o.O
12Is that specially setup for people asking you to do it again?
12XDDDD
Nah
you'll have more luck :P
cant in 1 player mode
awww
I'm player 1
I have to be Mario
Jenna could be though
It'sa you, Mario!
I could make a remote for it but it'd get me kicked hourly
tip if somene tries to throw you into a hole in multiplayer just press th A button puts you back intot he bubble :p
I'd be Toad when I'm player 2-4
12LOL
It'd be great
xD
or his yellow counterpart
Blue or yellow toad only
Red toad just gets trapped in boxes
oh yeah
Those levels are annoying
I remember playing one and failing at Walmart
I keep running into them
Grr... I hate noobs who would rather retype something than just use FEC when doing packet radio.
Haha
I remember that
I failed like immediatly after starting it I think
12ovO
fff
I mean... really, is waiting an extra... give seconds so bad? I would rather wait a few more seconds than have to send "Repeat what you said please." Every other line.
nsmbw was kinda fun but i kept running into my partner
and buncing back into the lava
Jenna will cry though
can't have that
:P
(As the static turns noras8GHga8[]/.'Q\
She'll also cry if you finish that obsene word
:P
shuddup
So don't say it out loud
just say "horse" instead
I keep saying "fffff" irl
Haha
I was for a while, but not so much anymore
hahaha we both died at the same time
fail
Hahaha wow
I asked my chemisrty teacher "why don't the noble gases have an ionic charge?"
and she says "Because the atoms of those gases are happy."
lol
thats the way my teacher puts it
I hate chemistry
I like chemistry over physics
I prefer Physics
I'd definitely prefer Physics
I actually kind of like calculus
i never had physics
and calculus is a big part of physics
Then she explained that they have the max amount of valance electrons
It's basically just applied Calculus
I am back
o_o
/me slaps InfamoysZed with a calculator
Infamoys

"IT WAS A LIFE!" fits it
lol
07lol
07reminds me of Trigun
02when does Sneas get back?
i mean we have the Avatar, the guy destined to save the world and has fought hundreds of enemies
/me pokes Drake
and now he can't kill the main antagonist o3o;
/me tackleglomps
02Drake
02when does Sneas get back?
/me shrugs
02I need him to restart VMware's network thing
so they just made up one part that was both interesting yet expected
04he didn't say
02because my thing got killed again
02what did he say before he went?
everything is expected in your eyes, Brother *runs*
/me bets that you expected her to type just then :O
03oh hi </late>
03I'm about to gro upstairs though
hi drf
03*Go
lol
the lateness of drf is expected :p
/me hides
well, well, your brotherlyness is expected! *shot for horrible come back*
there is no such thing o3o
Now Brotherism, that is real
so I'ma try connecting my server up to the network via wired
though last time it didn't work, so I figure it won't this time, either
Kyu: which episode?
Doesn't hurt to try
...
02It's not going to work right now
:V
07chapter 3
I mean to my router
02I need Sneas
02ah

network as in home network
/me explodes
07trying to free king boomy
oÎ”Î¿
ah, that one is a bit funny
/me hides
02k
though then it doesnt make sense how boomy can just break out at any time and bascially re-take it in any instant
and just waits for an eclipse
wb
03thanks

what do your parents think of your new job anyway?
03...
03my parents are the ones who GOT me the job
03I start on Monday
03XD
Just a single Spyro rock.
Haha
Why do people always come in here and ask if anyone likes Spyro?
I really don't know. Good question.
probably googled "spyro chat"
Like, obviously /someone/ likes Spyro, or this channel wouldn't be here
Haha.
would anyone here happen to be in need of a video card
It could be a Spyro chat about how much we hate Spyro? :o
I was trying to think of a sarcastic way to answer "how loves spyro"
/topic #spyrochat
oh XD
it's hard to mock things like that
They make so little sense
it would just be pointing out the obvious
"No, Howie Mandel despises Spyro from what I hear"
Kyu: so already past Azula introduction?
ha
07ya
Next time that happens we should all go, "No! Spyro sucks!" or something
:P
Hahaha
we should
we have to tell all the regulars that
haha, I'm so mean
I'll put it in the topic
XD
"Shut up about Spyro; no one cares."
"we all hate spyro here, just so you know"
XD
Haha, I like yours better
02o_O
heya
it's more honest
"So don't bother asking. Kthxbai"
XD
sorry my server got semiDDoSed again
.-.
Make a bot who greets like that
Aww :(
Yeah, Unreal isn't very DDoS resistant
.-.
AND works as a Grammar Police
:D
yeah xD
Unless it was the actual server
The ultimate anti-n00bbot!
it runs on a VMware thing
several unreal servers
the VMware network things need to be reset
restarted*

03OK so like
04I agree
Stupid Comcast
04@LL
03I've always thought BET (the TV channel) was racist, right
12ty
03well I have proof
03there's a show called "My Bladck Is Beautiful"
03WHAT THE FRICK KIND OF A SHOW IS THAT
04wat
03If we made a "white entertainment television", you know how fricking hard we'd be sued? >_>;
03And reverse racism is still racism
12o.o
03I could go on and on about this because being white I see it all the time, the "oh, you guys are so hard on us" crap
:/
03I'm like OK fine, but making a TV station just for blacks is no better than us making one just for whites
03>_>
:P
I've never had any problems with Comcast before though
Pretty much yes.
I agree :V
So maybe it's just NH Comcast
04same

/me shrugs
02I think it might border on dislike

:o
o.0
but my mom and i bargained that its better that i don't go since its still going to be hot cause its summer, and that since i can't get tickets to the midnight showing, that she'll pre order the movie so that i get it the day of its midnight release to dvd
so then, if I do this
xyzzy
yeah thats why i was so cranky earlier
then the ops are lazy
wat
normally i wait that long but only for 2 tickets.. me and my brother.. and i get 2 more tickets for a later showing so my mom and i can go since she works usually
oo

well do what u can its better than nothing

04I was thinking what types of porn people would make about it on the interwebs
02loooool
04MY EYEEES
02I'd like to make Reminiscence and The Rise of Ho-Oh's Realm movies .-.
02Reminiscence would be awesome
04lol
04yeah
02and TRoHR would also be good
04as a movie
14Making movies
14bleh
02haven't really thought about that though
02it's somewhere in mai files
02and
14I tried making my fan fics into movies once
02Underground wouldn't be too bad
14Epic failure
04and the result?
04lol
04I remember
04my very first fanfic
02I lol'd
04'The Mind of a Tortured Being'
02XD
04LOL
14Saphria X Cynder movie would be

04would be
14No need to say 8D
04the epitome of awesome
oo
x

02it made me lol
super science CGI that makes final fantasy movies look like a kids drawings
dragonsex
!!!
04lol
mix together
02@ Xeli
14xD
/me lols
mkay
04lol
that reminds me of Church Of Fudge
._.
02XD
04uhwat?
you don't wanna know seriously
04ok
04I'll hold you to that
04I wish I could draw humans
02Summary
02As a young child, Syril, sets off with her family for China, their aircraft is seized by terrorists. When the terrorists kill everyone on board, Syril, who has managed to survive, asks if she can follow them. Surprised, they take her in, and she becomes part of an underground criminal organization. Will she fit in with this new life?
02lol
02that came to my mind
04then I wouldn't be stuck as Irres in this pic
04HURR
02on the way home from China i think
04unlikely story much
02inorite
04ohnoes you killed my family can i join youz?
02but the concept of an underground criminal organisation is pretty interesting
lol wut
02the beginning fails
02I need another way to start it
04+psychic mind powas
02it's a strange concept derp
02I don't usually write that sort of fic
04so is time travel
048D
02I'm trying to stay away from magical powah
04lol
02or create it in a different way
04I still have that idea
04about how we all get into an anti-government org
02I need to edit Reminiscence
04and its all RE style
04with that virus
02because it's not supposed to be magical ;;
04I still think its an awesome concept minus the virus
02XD
<+Drake> +psychic mind powas
<3
02I like SoD, the concept is interesting but the beginning really fails
04NS
02I don't think I've told Xeli of it
04I've noticed with all of your OCs
02they girls?
02they're*
04you either bring in psychic mind powers
02XD
02I need to change that
02srs
04or you give them inhuman ninja skills
02Reminiscence wasn't meant to include that
04like Xale
02ture
02true*
04well
02but it's an imaginary world, come on
02xD
the best character is the least predictable one
02lulz
04Lyon seems to has super strengt and co-ordination in being able to wield that scythe but
02XD
02zomg
04lets ignore that
02XD
04and he can fly
02your fic includes magic etc.
any "character" i make has serious issues but appearently people find them "awesome" for some stupid reason
04with WINGS
02so that's different
04Espeon
02lol
04yours is just so different
lolo
02they are awesome
04like Chad
02CHAD lol
04because he uses drugs
/me hides
02XD
02and lol, Leo
02I ACTUALLY LIKE LEO
02both in Rem and out
a o-k
02XD
04I love that line
04but I hate the personality I gave her in VCS
02I want to restart VCS again
04yeah same
04this time LONGER
02XD
04not 15 pages
02lololol first time
02Xeli and me nmade up for like
027 of those pages
04I know
02XD
lol i remember that olol
04and considering everyone had rockets, lasers and plasma weaponry when we're meant to be poor, it was sorta unrealistic
02XD
04that's why Lyon only had two pistols
but it all made it awesome...er
04lol
04And Chad overpowered that chopper with a rifle
04I mean COME ON
well but still
02XD
02I need to finish Defeat
04and I still vote Seran was overpowered
02yeah xD
04and she's like
02Seran is ALWAYS overpowered
/me hides
04"I can predict the future ohnoes I'm gonna die I better leave a really annoying code for my closest friends to solve just to annoy them when they're about to die"

04TRoHoR
04Reminiscence
02chapter 17-25 to write of Reminiscence

I went to a place with loads of pigeons some days back
12Brown pigeons are everywhere here, probably because of our buildings
There was this one standing there with it's eyes closed
I poked it with my foot
03LOL black pigeons
03that's so racist
/me hides
12usually I only see the gray ones with the green and purple shiny necks o3o
It open it's eyes, realised what happened, and scrambled away
12lol
12The brown ones have the shiny necks too
12Just harder to see
12didn't see that
12ah
And then I got pigeon poop on my shoes, which I had to hose down at a public toilet.
Whut
/me wishes it took a picture...
12Brown ones are just a mutation, but there are lots of them here because we have lots of red roofed buildings and brick
03LOL @ this fail picture I took the other day

vBulletin 4 is crap and is getting worse

IPB is more community based
and is what we are looking for

The S's come from the fact that the nickname "guest" is registered on most websites.

7Nope, Arti, still broken. :/
12It's ok I'll try
huh?
7And I suppose, LL.
7My English teacher once gave the song as an example of irony.
12lolz
that line is too easily guttermind convertable
7Isn't that ironic in itself?
brb, need to do stuff.
12~its like raaaaaiiiiin, on your wedding day~

/me notes that o/` is a music note
12~A free riiiiiiiiide, when you've already paid
12~
some more than others though
/me pokes drf
7It's the good advice that you just didn't take.
03what
I'm aware :|
12I have used the ~~ since I first started quoting misuc >:|
but if I really wanted to do sexual things, I'd be drawing porn. SINCE I CAN NOW.
03whatever floats your boat o.o
YAY FOR SEEING IN COLOR.
lawl...
12~And who would have thought: it figured~
7A traffic jam when you're already late~
/me isn't sure what to do with himself right now
12~A no smoooo-OOOOking sign on your cigarette break~
/me hmms
03EW SMOKING
7It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife~
03and with that I leave to take a shower
12I like that song :>
12It's meeting the man of my dreams...and then meeting his BEAUTIFUL wife...
12good old 90s stuff
12XD
/me nods
7And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
12mom let me listen to her when I was like: 8
12~Aaaaand life has a funny way of swingingaboneyourwaywheneverything'sokandeverything's allllllll riiiii-iiiiight~

7Basically that's it.
7And life has a funny way, like the previous.
12no
12there's a little bit more...
7Well, we could continue on. o3o
7Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly~
12He packed his suuuuuuitcase and kissed his kids good-byeeee-eee

12what else needs doing on TST?
that was the point
@ the line
xD
7That adoptable bird thing from all the way back, and will probably not get programmed.
12DDDDDDD:
12The description on a Lugia plush on Ebay
12"This listing is for Lugia - Odd looking minger on the cover of SoulSilver"
D:<
12o.o
oO
12MINGER LOL D:
7Eh?
12o...k?
!define minger
-!- An unattractive person (of either sex)
12O.O
7o3o
7Huh.
12I guess it's a British only term
a I allowed to bite the auctioneer?
7But Lugia's genderless, so...
12you should, TS o3o
That's funny and strange at the same time
/me flys over and bites the guy's head off
Save some for the rest of us
and I mean them
12lolz
12wait
12is it a he?
hey, I don't eat him, I CHEW him. Big difference
12if so, I know what I could do >:D
/me dies
12I'll tell you why!
12we're racist like that >:|
12(Idk actually)
they don't want you to ship anywhere else.
simple.
12ah
12So of course, I didn't bother buying it
if you get this comment via mail - forward it to ebay then :)
Well you can ask me. I've got a pretty good idea why
the seller will receive a warning then
12and that was quite a big box
around 5 Euros here
12Like the size of an easter egg box
espeonface.jpg
12Oh and don't even get me started on SMJ...
hey, they ask almost the price I paid to send the parcel to Xai and you...via U.P.S.!
7	http://www.lugia.us/sprite/displayimage.php?pos=-1285
12They charged me $64 for shipping a few figures in a massively over-packed box
12ol
12*Lol
12o.o
7But, ah, I see a small glitch.
always seems to me "the land of the Free" is the most racist land in the world. Sadly
=D
I mean - the plush: US $59,99
12I changed them
Mrr
the shipping: US $39,99
7Ag.
7Ah*
12We get taxed too
that's almost an airline ticket to the US!
Still
12It's just money grabbers that charge so much, people I know give me the REAL shipping price
12Thats why I don't believe it's all that expensive
murr
12Infact, one person said "I'll send you all this Articuno stuff for $30 including shipping!" I said "Deal!" They said "Oh wait, you're in the UK..? You'll have to add $2 to the shipping costs, is that ok?"
12LOl
/me is stuck in the middle
Cute x3
12o3o
and that's why I take a look on the parcel how much the seller originally paid for shipping, call the money back and send the correct amount for goods and shipping back
:3
/me HIDE
12*HIDES
Also late but
Quilava:	 YAY FOR SEEING IN COLOR.	[ 11:15 AM ] <== zuh?
12Buy from anywhere else and they charge you acceptable shipping costs, UNLESS they're selling like an iPod or whatever for 99p, then they have the shipping at £50 LOL
7Speaking of all this, the Giratina figure's on its way, right?
NEEDS MORE SEX.
12Quan no, I've still not had a chance to go to the post office
12I'll let you know when it's on it's way
and regarding taxes. Do you know mow much of my monthly income is taken from me through taxes without me buying a single piece? 43% of my entire income!
7Okay.
12It's a pain in the wSAHghrgj going to the post office here >>
7Thanks again in advance. :)
XD
No I mean
12lol
12But thats not including everything else we pay tax on
Did you not see in color once?
12the post office here is like: right down the road o3o
12So it amounts to more like 60-70%
my monitor was dying :|
bought a new one yesterday
Ah

12Tekken is the greatest thing ever
14Well the older ones
Tekken is alright
/me obtained a 360 a few months ago
Guilty Gear is good!
12I rarely play anything else naos lol
14Tekken 4 onwards = crap
5But I do play the Gamecube at church (only because we have Super Smash Bros: MELEE)
/me didn't like Tekken
o.o
12but then again...
12havent yet played 5 and 6 is really lame
12except for SSB, I don't like fighting games o3o
14Tekken 3 all the way for me

12Role
14LOL SSBM
14I've got that
12Melee was too "hardcore" for my tastes o3o

OoT
12Ocarina of Time

03LOL
03hi
why? is there connection isses?
03I can't belive my shirt got ripped :/
12Aw what shirt and how?
Mine doesn't, for some unknown reason. Dual-layered disc
a cd-i?
hmm
03it's my Dr. Pepper shirt
03and it happened when I was cutting the grass
03it got snagged on a tree and got a huge hole ripped in the shoulder
is that similar to the 3do?
03I need to see if I can replace it
but no I don't have a cd-i
12Sorry brb again
I used to have an SNES. :(
there are consoles that I'm missing
just a matter of finding them at the right price..
the snes was awesome
12gzsetduji
Wbs
03XD
/me records the movie Top Gun
03on A&E HD
03whee high definition movies
what happened to Jamez?
He's a member who was banned a long time ago
ah
So I got rid of him
12I love HD TV
03same
12Good for watching nature programs
03and I can record it on my computer now
03...LOL
03screw nature programs, I watch *movies*
03and MythBusters
/me runs
sports :o
03meh sports
12brb
03I don't watch sports in any definition
a neo geo cdz can cost a grand to buy
and that came out in the early to mid 90s
03o/` right...into...the...danger zone o/`
does he get in here through different names?
Yeah, he tries to evade bans all the time
we catch him pretty fast though.
This is the first time he's been able to stay for more than half a second
Because he finally figured out his host was banned and used a different one
if you ban the entire host you can ban someone else who uses it right?
12I HATE the new girl on Mythbusters
talking shit about people?
03who, Jessie?
Yeah
07zzz
12I don't even know her name because I dont care
03XD
12She's stupid
03you don't mean the redhead though, do you?
Then he proceeded to prove that we should have banned him long ago by harassing other SF staff on other sites
right right
I needed a bit of a memory refreshment.
I don't get why he's trying so hard
You'd think after what, a year and a half, he'd have realized we don't want him
12LOL
12NO
03k
yeah
what was wierd was that he seemed nice too
03good
03because she's cool
03and hot
/me runs
12Unless the new girl died her hair red too?
03LOL no
03the new girl is like, blonde, right?
12Yeh but
She was just talking to him
I am
Before I noticed he was there
12The thing I don't like about her is that she tries to act like Cari
Oh i see.
My bad.
I was just talking to him yeah
03yeah
03it's Kari btw
12If they were gonna bring a new girl in, she should have been completely different
12and ok lol
The thing about him, hes got a problem
one second hes the nicest guy
03at least Kari is still on the show
anger problem?
03in the first season she wasn't
then suddenly he gets angry for no reason
12Yeh she'l be back right?
and stats cussing you out and stuff.
starts*
03she's still there
03they just now have like 6 people LOL
12Err
12Last I knew she left because of having a babdy
12*baby LOL.
I remember when he was first banned
He kept coming in here trying to apologize
Then when we wouldn't listen he started swearing at us
I said "im not unbanning you"
after hes saying sorry and stuff
then he says, "well then Fu** you!"
and starts bitching.
ha
03oh
03wait, really?

12Yes thats why the new girl is there
03this is the newest episode
He contacted me once on dA asking to be unbanned
03yep
12I never really did like wolfie.
03and Kari is there
12I could be a bit behind then, I haven';t watched it in like a year
03maybe she's back?
03ah
03I know the girl you're talking about, but Kari is definitely still there
And he's never bugged me again
:D
03as this episode was from last week, the newest one, and she's there
12Ok good, and they kept the new girl..? -v-
03er
03did they?
03lemme look
12Im asking lol
03I don't remember
12Ok
03nope
03she's not in this episode
03she must have just been a temporary replacement then
03the only episodes she's in that I recorded are the reruns from like a year ago XD
12XD
03I'm gonna bug the cable company when they come out today
03and ask why some of my recordings are being copy protected
03see what they say XD
03as that's stupidly annoying, the fact that I can't cut the commercials or anything
is he the only one trying to get unbanned?
We occasionally get other annoying people who manage to get back on the forum
03oh btw, I found my Platinum, AND my Pearl
03both of which I had lost
03:D
12Good XD
03I had to pull a storage unit out, it had fallen behind that LOL
this place must be popular if you get people like that heh

I decided to call myself Zharaal because Darkspace is one of my favourite bands
didn't SR tell you yesterday though that you gotta use your SpyroForum username?
Eh
As long as he tells us who he is, I think it's fine
I don't remember that
:D
:P
So, how is everybody?
I'm great
That's good
I've finally started recording
show last night was amazinggg
I got a few videos of it too
Excellent

I wrote some more lyrics today
I've suddenly developed some bizarre obsession with "The Void"
7Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
Thats awful, tbh

/me floofs all over Obsi
What's up Kyu?
Then why did you listen to them? :P
07stuuuuuuuuuuuuuuffs
I wanted to see what all this big fuss over their new album is about
It's like Tokio Hotel's Humanoid
There's always big fusses about sucky things :P
I don't mind Tokio Hotel, I used to be obsessed but I got over them
ARG!
lol
*suicide*
He's ugly as sin
that shouldn't really matter...the only problem I have with him is his worshippers AND the people that are overly hateful, and he just sounds too young to be singing about the things he does
LOL SR likes JB
Hahahaha
...now we know why he's so rich!
LOLno
Because he likes Justin Bieber?
He looks 12 at least
I don't get it
:P
There's no way he's 16
nvm :P
Oh, because he /is/ Justin Bieber?
XD
duhhh
Well, they're both the same age...
:O
...XDDD
ummm
hmm
I really love all of the ocean and the sun album
favorites off of that are I the Swan, Ocean and the Sun, Another Leather Lung and Cellophane
I must consider getting that album
tsoaf is like really hard to find
I still haven't found the first album anywhere
I have the first
where on earth did you find it o_o
Filestube
I don't buy the albums first time, just in case I don't like it
oh I meant hard copys
Eh
Amazon?
buying it online is cheating :P
That's how I got AC
Although I bought Diary of Dreams' Dream Collector in South Africa
It has a rather interesting collection of remixes
I don't like buying CDs online unless it's physically impossible to buy one in the store, i.e. one without a record label thus they're not allowed to sell them
That sucks
I got DoD at the store. Ordering anything online in SA is generally a bad idea
03hi
02argh D:
02hiya DRF
okay?
03argh what?
:|
02I wanna go out nsomewhere
03o

03do you have a driver's license?
02no

03oh :/
03I got mine at 17 LOL
03which is late, most people get it at 16
03I was just lazy and waited
My engrish are delishuss
02I was hoping I could go to LL's
haiBL
02since LL's is within walking distance from my house
02hiya Brother
It's very difficult to find DoD anywhere

I'm just waiting for the Nostalgia critic to put that up
I was searching for 100x100 spyro images for my cube. :o

Related searches: spyro dawn of the dragonspyro and cyndercynder

14also sorry for copypasta

12Wow, this Thai green curry isn't bad for the jared stuff
Luna: that proved that you can die from a movie
/me wonders how that's more "wtf" than "Spyro and cynder mating"
Currrrrrry <3
/me ewws
I prefer chicken but all curry is good
Good lord, haven't seen that before
12Tastes better than the take away thai green curry I had
8 years and still eating it
Broccoli and Cheese is ftw thou
12Brother, I'm eating chicken thai green curry
14:o
X3
14Curry :o
/me goes all gollum on the curry
12It's not like normal curry Aero
14Damn you Arti D:
14I want a curry now ;;
orly?
"it is mine, MINE! lET US HAVE ITS"
O>O;;;;;;;;;
*O.O
12Mine
12Only made enough for me

Oh man, that's funny

12-v-
12Just try that in person lol
14I'd call that pretty damn good
/me blinks and shakes her head "never understood the big deal about curry," she then flies away
14Why? XD
But came in with the same name he got banned on last night, and got banned again.
12No I'm being sarcastic

/me omnomnomnoms the chicken! :D
o.o
Eh, those pictures don't bother me
...We know
Thanks
14Wow... ysome of you here are really into stupidly high powered comps >>
They used to though, then I just stopped caring
80GB is nothing though. :o
14THAT'S WHY I HAVE EXTERNALS HELLO
And so's 512MB RAM.
14>>
External is much slower.
14RAM Can be upgraded
does what?
14plus 80GB on a C drive is more than enough for me
14512MB RAM is a damn sight better than what I have now
Then whhy do you complain about it?
14and Pentium 4 3GHz processor
Or any sort really
14Again a damn sight better than what I have now
O
I'm not bothered by it
/me puts Aero in Jaws 3D
What does that have to do with being annoyed that you keep repeating over and over that you're not bothered by it?
what's life without complaints for ridiculous things
If you don't care about it, don't talk about it
OMFG!!!!!!!
When did I say I don't care about it?
Yeah it is. I've used external before.
Exactly
/me screams and swims out, flying away as fast as possible
:P
You're doing the exact same thign
you complain about a lot of things
*ting

Fail
14Meh
Heheheheh
14They work fine for me
Oh, and I found what you've been searching on google
12Hey aero what are you anyway?

12LOLZ
You got me
nope
and D:
/me likes the computers he has and doesn't give a <censored> what anyone here thinks about them. :3
14If it's to do with porn, then I've already seen it

MUST TELL LATER
12What the hell
03	 	
Shiny~
12Why can't I type "start C:\Program Files\ into the command prompt without it saying it can't find "C:\Program" ? ovo
nuuu
 
my blank are better
use quotes
/me is sad thinking about something now :<
12How come it doesn't require quotes for just C:\ ?
Where is everybody?
it only looks at the first word unless the whole thing is specified as a string with quotes
/me crawls under Sneas
any path without spaces works, but soon as there are spaces you need quotes
Dead.
12Now it's not doing anything.
Damn, I shouldn't have had the curry
12Just.. opening up a new cmd..
um
Hey, Aic.
:P
12Double or singe qoutes?
No, why, have you?
'start "C:\Program Files\"' minus ''
cd.. until you get to C:
then do cd Pro tab
I looked at her page :'D
and it should work
12It should work without having to cd shouldn't it??
dunno
http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=100001138286749&ref=ts
I do it with cd
12Well, double quotes doesn't work, just opens up cmd
12Ok
You're on facebook?
12cd
12Oops
12LOL
LOL
cd.. is parent folder
She really /is/some kind of creep, I guess.
Yeah/
Cool, me too
12Still doesn';t work XD
cd is current directory?
12I dunno why it opens a new CMD
http://www.emp-online.co.uk/bin/shop.php?rubrik=bodymenu&Sucheintrag=Gothic+coat&list_sort=gd&prog=search&tc=SEARCH&stat=yes I want this coat
What are you trying to do?
:P
cd is change directory
12Run a batch file that kills any open Winamps then re-opens it
12Sounds pointless I know but it's for the radio
ew god she watches glee
hahahahaha
And she likes Twilight
Glee sucks
7she looks like someone's brother in year 8 at my school
Where's the batch file?
LOL
12It needs to switch playlists, and I could just have a file that loads the playlist but Winamp has to restart for the song requestor to update
xD
7it's kinda scary, in fact
12Desktop
Called?
iCarly??? Ugh
12Why... does it matter..?
7also, apparently she was born in 1990, making her twenty years old. what the fuck?
03bbs
03xD
You need to know what the batch file is called to run it from CMD.
hahahaahahaaahah I always put 1990 too
People write wrong birth years all the time.
12No Im not running the batch file from CMD
...
12I'm running the batch file directly off the desktop
To get in you have to be a certain age, can't remember what.
12Then it OPENS Cmd and runs the commands
13/14
So what's wrong with that?
12If I tell it to start C:\ it opens C
She is?
Basil?
12If i tell it to start C:\Program Files it can't find it
02cya :P
ew
12If I use double quotes it just opens up another CMD
7yeah. isn't he like 18?
Basil Fawlty XD
Something like that
o.O
What's with all the pedophiles here?
try "C:\Program Files\"?
12I did Ovo
MJ is here?
shouldn't make a difference but cmd is strange
Shit!
12I know >v<
It opens up a new CMD window with the directory being C:\Program Files
12Yes
tbh I really don't think that michael jackson was a pedophile
What do you want it to do?
12It is supposed to open the location though
didn't one of the kids that said he touched him fess up that he lied shortly after he died?
12I thought thats what the start command did.
Oh, in windows explorer?
:P
Well at least it wasn't Ian Huntley
12Yes, just like it opens C:\ in explorer
Ugh, I'm beginning to weary of Facebook.
I might just leave.
I hardly use it
Start "Starts a separate window to run a specified program or command."
02lol forgot to identify
I use it since I hate using phones and texting.
My Myspace hasn't been used in months
12Hmm, why does it work for C:\ then?
Got it.
might be that C:\ default points to explorer but the others have no such association
I still go on MS even though no one really contacts me on it except for bands
Start explorer.exe "C:\Program Files"
12Ahh
12Lets try that
It works for me.
I just tried it.
12Awesome
I stopped using it seeing as there was nobody to chat to
12Yes!
12Thanks!
I like Myspace even less than Facebook
No problem. :)
hahahahahaaahah yeah
Hey Brother. :D
Am I allowed to know? :)
remember Resistance fall of man? :P
anybody wanna wi-fi battle?
12It works perfectly, now to test it on the server.
7I feel like I haven't been here in months. who the fuck are all these people?
You should know me by now
I just got here today..
7are you still here? I thought you left
7very few people join here. I wonder why...
7:P
Yay caught Rayquaza finally >>
Sure.
Peon.
lol
Dunno
7yeah he is a crazy bastard
asdfasghdfhasgfdhas, It was annoying, had to restart like 18946238904612984128451289 timwes

Stupid outrage >>
Dari: Yes.
No comment to that one lol

Mhm. Hasn't evolved.

D:
XDD
yeah
my Rayquaza's sad now =(
and even when they put hair on spyro where his spikes go
goood lol]
Actually, not quite, wait till KJ drops off.

hahahahhahahahaah
Tis all good
7it's a retarded Castform
/me floofs the lord of the seas
Rotom FTW!
7and Castform was pretty retarded to start with
It's quite funny though
there, now it's all good XP
I love Rotom. He's hawt.
:o
7that reminds me. there's a door in a house in Mossdeep which is always either locked or blocked by something. It has ALWAYS pissed me off that that nevero pens
7opens*
Ugh, pokemon
Pokermon
7I tried to walk-through-walls it, but that didn't work
google it :P
...robots?
Rotom?
it's a pokemon.
a stupid one XD
It's one backwards motor.
Well, electricity can also be hot, right?
/me needs to get the Darkness again
Gale of Darkness! *shot*
Fair point.
I like pokemon
After game number 6 I got quite sick of it. And the anime annoys me
I don't think any of us here watch the show lol
Thank God
It's so boring, all he does is walk around and get attacked by Team Rocket
the first generation of the show was great
Andeach time they blast off again it's not reptitive in the slightest.
*and each
Then they made more episodes :P
Banned pokemon episodes are funny though.
James with boobs. XD
Did they ever even bother to explain how Meowth could talk?
....*goes to look that up*
XD
I don't think so
No, The Darkness o3o
7not counting the hundreds of millions of spinoffs
03thanks </late>

So... muc... Japan... feeling... undermined...

12Ok I have a Winamp problem now :>
12Can't open a play list and have it start playing the songs automatically
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEtzhAt5_bo
12It just opens Winamp and does nothing
If not. ^
that's stupid
12I know it's annoying
Mine's been doing that for a VERY long time
I can't figure out why
same
12It didn't used to..?
omg hahhahahahaha
7Dari: they say they banned loads of episodes but hardly any of them actually were. the only one that was ACTUALLY banned was the on where ash is threatened with a gun
i just downloaded it last month, and i hardly use it XD
so i really don't know
They never bothered to make it into English. :P
It used to play normally, idk why it's messed up now
You having problems opening teh m3u playlist files?
12Yes
That's funny, banned because it had a gun
hahahhahaha he grabs his honkers
This one was banned, oherwise why is it only in Japanese?
What winamp version you using?
12When I double click them, they open Winamp but dont start playing the playlist
7Dari: I said HARDLY any were banned
12Sec
k
Yeah, well.
125,56
12I'm happy to downgrade
03EW
Hold on let me check mine
03get 2.91
I remember this whole big thing about Pokemon being satanic and telling children to kill themselves...It was ridiculous
03so anyway, my friend and I are going to see Prince of Persia in a bit ^^
WHAT
There are still people who think that.
12That movie is gay
03wtf
7get out
Kindle.
03he told me it was really good
12Because you're going to watch it
12:DDD
03...
03LOL
I agree with Arti on that one
xDDD
lol
The gay part I mean
03oh you're nice :P
7I love it when people do that
12LOL
I remember that I first heard about that film something like 3 years ago.
12Hello.
12wait Im a peadge
Prince of Persia was a major let down :(
12I checked MY version of Winamp rather than the Servers
12It's 5.57
Oh for God's sake
TAS?
7the abdridged series
Oh.
as is mine
12Ohh..
blarg
Maybe it's the version blah
That must be an interesting thing to see, invisible guns
12Must be, it just loaded fine on 5.56
12right time to downgrade
12Oh frick >v<
12this is going to be a RIGHT pain
03go get 2.91
12No..?
12Why shoud I? 5 is fine
03no, it sucks
032.91 FTW
7they just point
12Why does it suck?
while I'm at it, maybe I should download Windows ME
12It plays music doesnt it?
Right
but anyway gone again
I'm using 5.56
03LOL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1dO9f4oZ7s&feature=related
hahahhaahahahahaaaha
I've had NO problems with it
03Articuno, I'm guessing you also like Office 2007?
12No?
12I dont even use office
03LOL
03fail
12Seriously the new winamp is exactly the same as the old one, whats the difference?
^
12It opens, it plays.. WOW
The only difference is supported media files to be honest
and auto-tagging
03the difference is that the new ones are a lot more bloated and add crap that wasn't even needed
That's so wrong.
03not to mention 2.91 can play IMF files from old DOS games :)
and a few other niggles that i need
03and the newer ones don't
drf, the new ones can do that
the music is so fitting
tis called plugins
03orlyt
03-t
o.O
in a sick way
:'D
03it's a plugin for 2.91 also
12DRF you dont have to install the crap obviously..
03yes you do...
03it comes with it
12You can just deselect like EVEYRTHING
03then why install it at all?
ugh, my nephew is spazzing about getting HG for his birthday v.v
032.91 also opens and plays music :P
12You install the player..
12Here's why I install it, because it's the first link on the Winamp website, Im hardly going to go out looking for the oldest version when I can justclick download right away
03LOL
03I just go to oldversion.com and click 2.91, download
03it's like two more clicks
12Yeh but.. whats the point?
03because I like 2.91
12and I like 5? Ok?>
03I'm too lazy to go try to find the vintage looking theme for the newer versions
12I didnt install all the rubbish on it
12I just use the Lugia theme..
03LOL
03I use the 2.91 theme :P
lolz
Pointless arguements are fun
/me hides
well I downgraded to 5.56 and it didn't fix it
D:
14Alt it's a problem with your m3u files then
12.....
isn't 5.56 a caliber?
14LOL
>_<
14Just remake the m3u files, then it should work
well it happens with any fil
e
12I'm already reinstalling 5.56 xD
more of an annoyance lol
Hope yours works lol
k gone
12Byes
The movie was kool o3o
12..
12It's not working
12Need to do a complete reinstall rather than just installing over the current version perhaps XD
12More work now XD

.worms >>
12I have epic RSI -v-
eww worms are so yucky
12worms are cool
I was raped by an ogre.
there's nothing good with worms thou D:
ring worm, tape worm.... you get my point
He had three eyes, and was in a wheelchair.
The rest is history.
I set fire to Varg Vikerness' underwear
12....
I have to take a poor tasting medcine because of them
After confessing my love for him
12Earthworms are cool then
lol yeah
Of course, I was horribly drunk
wait... you have worms, Brother? O.o
I've had them, might have them again
they are the white ones
the ones that eat you
tape worms?
Yes
eww
porr guy D:
*poor
I just hope they arent coming out
O.o;;;
they will. But you won't see in fact
not the 'other way'
they usually don't
Hmm, thats odd
they have no teeth - so "eathing through" is kinda difficult
which
hey brother, how the heck did you get tape worms? Did you eat raw meat or something?
No, if you ask me how I get something I just say "well a more important question is how to kill them"
it's enough to eat one little egg to get one. And that can be almost anywhere. Including not properly washed salad
wait wait wait...
i thought that you only got it if you wate raw meat
*ate
/me doesn't want salad ever again now o.o;;
/me shock paddles the chat.
nope
but when you cook meat all the stuff gets killed
eggs leave their bodies the "backdoor" - and the dung is used to fertilize the fields. For salad, corn or whatever
on harvest, some of this dung remains on the plants, salad and corn - and with it the eggs
eww
that makes me never want to eat eggs or salad ever again
14xD
theres worse Aero XD
I can go ahead so you'll never wanna eat ANYTHING again :P
please don'
*don't
Pay no mind, no one special here...
12How is everyone?
my appitite is lost for supper now, thank you very much v.v
did you know each candy bar has about 0.7 insect legs in it?
on average
..... ok ok
enough.... please
i'm gonna be ill....
They must not be plugged in.
and you will in your entire life and whilst asleep swallow about 17 insects and 3 spiders without noticing
knew that already.....
I killed one last night so that was avoided :P
bugs are gross
*gasps*
I live!
12Nooo
12They're awesome
what?
12The swallowing bugs thing....
i'm gonna go.......
no, it's just a statistic
bbl
same goes for the chocolate - insect leg - thing
12For one, not everyone sleeps with their mouth open
12and whaat?
12XD
12what chocolate thing?
/me points up to the candy bar-fact
Arto: well 'apperently' in every candy
though apperently every chocholate candy
you eat insect legs
I know this fact from people who should know it: They develop the machines to manufacture chocolate and candy bars
12Read it
12yes that is very believable considering I saw some insect legs at a restaurant
But nobody else did. I do believe its called a defribulator
I think
what resturant?
12OMG I'll never forget the time me and Xai saw a fly.. that looked like it was dying.. so Xai swatted it and about 10 miniture bugs came OFF the fly and scattered around DDDDD:
12Just one over here somewhere
12That was the most disgusting thing I've EVER seen..
12Oh and when all the bugs had come off.. the fly was actually JUST A HEAD DDD; THAT WAS SOMEHOW STILL FLYING AROUND
"welcome to the Just one over here somewhere resturant, We'll feed you food :D"
I know something even more disgusting
12...
12Do i really want to hear this? XD
a woman was in a jungle and "bitten" by a spider. It was painful, but she thought it was okay
12.....uh oh
Hello
Arti: well it isnt as bad as seeing a calf being birthed but then having to run from the mother since you were right in its way when they took the baby
a week ago i saw a bee being eaten by a huge spider, it was awesome
hi
after about two weeks she wondered why the swelling wasn't going away and was so black and stuff - so she went and saw the doctor
12Ovo
12POOR BEE LOL
the doctor opened the swelling - and a hundred little baby spiders crawled out of the wound
12......................
12LOOOOOOOOOL
yeah I know what you mean
haha wtf
12i'm gonna be sick XD
12Is that really real..?
hrm - need to ask google to maybe find pictures of it
ironically that was the first instance i saw large amounts of blood, and birth
It was lulzworthy.
and I was..what 5
*at me
6?
What did he say?
what about?
7This is an interesting discussion here/
12XD
/me 7gives Arti a platypus
12thanks
/me chews it
12XD
I called one of his friends name Jaron Juh-ron instead of Jair-on. xD
quick poll, would you catch a spider and throw it outside, or just kill it
XD
*named Jaron
wow
INFA Z :D
12I throw them out all the time
hey
kill it XD
zup
But after he corrected me, i insisted on saying Juh-ron even more.
12But I catch them with tissue becaause they run around in your hands and it feels horrible XD
7Squish.
I killed one yesterday
So after a while he starting getting pissed.
hahahahahaah
12You lot are cruel :/
7And mosquitoes. And giant locust/cockroach thingies.
12Fyi I LOVE locusts..
I get mosquitoes all the time and kill them XD
12You can get pet locusts..
quick kill the locust!
/me hides
7They give lots of protein! :D
7(And yes, people do eat them.)
12You know it annoys me that if people talk about killing anything other than invertebrates, everyone goes mad..
at least its better than eatting grasshopper, terrible taste
i once tried to catch a fast spider but couldn't get it with bog roll, so i sprayed the spider with air freshner, and it went MENTAL
7O3o
dam... cant slap people on this computer...
7Eh?
Well I am angry how he keeps bringing up religion. I thought Spyro22 was the problem
Andrew: what?
mhm
XD
Arti: depends
What's wrong with people bringing up religion?
I wouldn't be mad at him for his beliefs but just the fact that he's a missionary like you said
12Ovo;
You can bring up atheism, can't you?
what is the anything?
I don't have a problem with it normally, but he brings it in every conversation.
^that
12doesn't, if I sat here and told you I killed a bird or a rabbit you'd all be like OMG CRUEL but why is it ok for invertebrates??
12I hate people who pick and choose life.
because it feels like they're invading your personal space
No, not really unless you enjoyed it
7Common perception of insects?
it actaully is
I don't have a problem with people talking about their religion but with people like him that bring it up in every little thing it starts to get on my nerves
You're not supposed to talk about sexuality, politics, or religion on the forums
12Brother speak for yourself, anyone else would tell me to stop talking about such a horrible thing
12Well I'll have you know I don't like hearing your stories about killing bugs, I'm fond of themn
Although I hate that rule because I feel it's unnecessary censorship
7Lol, Arti, at your forum quote.
12Omg I know
12it's the best quote ever
I don't care if people bring up religion
I don't enforce it that much because SR yelled at me once for it
I don't see a problem with it
well as much as I would love to have a room-mate a mosquito is not one I have in mind o3o;
I was just trying to do what he asked me to do yknow
So I never enforce the rule
I get 10 a week
He technically took that rule down, just not physically.
!define bucket list
-!- The Bucket List is a 2007 comedy-drama film directed by Rob Reiner, written by Justin Zackham, and starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. ...
7o3o
12Mosquitos is slightly different, they attack you
Yeah I don't have a problem either...but the fact that it's still a "forum rule" I try not to let it happen I guess
Yesterday he said it's not a real rule, and he meant to take it off a while ago.
To be honest, I'm pretty sure SR couldn't care less how the forum is run
good point...
I dont mind flies though
That's why I like SR
whereas spiders are just chillin?
He doesn't exactly moderate it much
he said the other day he was "thinking about taking away that rule"
12Self defence is just differnet to killing something because you don't like it
12Yes Andrew Ovo
oh right i see your point
True
12-v- lies lol
14Spiders are awesome
People have good suggestions, but nothing ever comes of them because SR doesn't give a crap
Lol
I almost regret killing the spider
That's why I want to make my own forum
And why RDX made his
12Ok
12It's taken me ALL this time
but then my dog might eat it so I gave it a better death then being digested
Like my suggestions to make the forum less diluted so that it appears more active?
we're sick of SR not caring about what anyone says
12But I finally did what I was originally doing, setting up the radio to switch playlists at certain times of day
Hola
Anyways, how's everyone doing today?
cool
and has it worked?
:P
Bueno
12Yes ^^
I'm doing good
Just won a robotics competition
12Im currently playing the wrong playlist ¬¬
o.o
I'm waiting for videos to pop up from the show last night and I'll post mine soon :D I was in the very front
12Oh crap now I borked up the requestor -v-
the radio page isn't loading for me atm
What show last night?
12OMG it's going to take me AGES to fix that
derp
12Andrew try nest.lugia.us:9999
Everybody is alive?
good old war
works
How was the show?
that is just the shout cast thing, no requester though
What is Good Old War?
a band
folk band :D
Ahh...
very fun
i already have the radio bookmarked in winamp :P
hey now..
Omfg... Someone is copying my italics on the forum...
thats unfair cause i cant slap you back
I'm going to schmek you met a kipper
You can't own the italics markup
But I did technically do that before everyone else.
got it~
Now people are copying me :'(
I don't really like it much anyways =/ Kind of looks like you're quoting something when you write that way
Lol
you must revere his words as it is written
they will be famous someday
/me tries to fix
lol
...
You just HAD to say that
/me does nothing, because he is quite boring.
i still cant get any nick commands
That is weird
Oh, pain, just what I needed. :)
So you right click on the name and nothing comes up?
Where is SR?
Didn't he just log in a moment ago?
just a menu bar with only nick commands and nothing else
Maybe you need to reinstall icechat
/me rawrs
meh..
/me hides
I have no idea how that could have happened
too lazy
12Fixed..phew
dam keyboard is too small
12Argh.. well sort of..
What does that have to do with anything?
XD
12The time left script is broken again v_v
So now that people have taken italics, should I try bold?
my fingers are like sausages trying to pick up pennies on this thing
Or go with bold AND italics!
Whatever you want
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KsgWUg0Zzk
*BOLDY*
I don't care either way, although I think both would look kinda stupid
*/BOLDITALICY/*

I slept in until 11:30 today
WHAT IN GODS NAME IS WRONG WITH YOU LD
Pinnochio: My nose will grown now.

D: That's impossible.
Now it doesn't seem like it's 7:30 already

Is it bad that I kind of want to look it up now because I'm curious what you're talking about?
haha
I*
"It's a shock photo, don't look it up."
DO EET
NOT REALLY
I'm so glad I don't have to work weekends
more than "shock"
That would suck
oi..
It's diseased lady parts. Don't, seriously.
everyone more or less forgot about me cause of my weekend shift..
I just gagged a bit
lol
/me forgets
I've seen enough diseased and dead bodyparts on Carcass albums, so it didn't phase me too much
Ew.. <.<
And I didn't even look it up
lol
now i cant go party
Proto, just dont
I hate sleeping in so late, it makes me feel like ive wasted the whole day.,

Yeah, I don't think I'll look it up now
/me shudders
Nothing much, just painted a snail red for my cousin.
Self control ftw!
nice
Why]
First paycheck, then laptop, then maybe CoD
It wouldnt work on her aspire one.
:P
CoD is boring, so that's not a solution.
I want to make a FPS you can play in your browser
lol ill wait for rdx to flame the hell out of you
free, multiplayer.
That would be cool.
RDX and I agree to disagree.
:P
SR: That would be cool.
I disagree to agree.
i remain switzerland
You're wrong, but I'll agree.
I just realized my first paycheck alone will be enough to buy a pretty decent laptop
id wait for the next one to get an awsome laptop
Is there such thing as a decent laptop?
For my money, I usually partition it out
I didn't count taxes though...
Sounds like an oxymoron.
50% goes into savings
Yeah, I'm going to have a lot go into tuition
20% goes into whatever piece of gadgetry im currently saving for
10% church
I'm going to have so many loans I'll have to pay $400 a month for 10 years to pay them of
*off
20% goes into my drawer
incase I need some cash some time.
when does he start
I'm not sure
He forgot to ask them what days he'd be working
i need to yell at him to buy a decent laptop too so we can all get some sort of game for it
he should call them
why not play CS 1.6
It works on almost any hardware now days.
cs sounds good too
I guess he was just so happy they didn't change their minds when he got the wrong SSN
ha
instead they call the cops on him
Hahaha
for identity theaft
I dont have a social security number.
your in canada
you chanuck
I finally memorized mine
I'm socially insecure, and I don't need a number.
this isnt china.
ha
i'm starting to wondner if someone may have stolen mine...
I have never paid a cent in income tax yet
I was so worried for a while that my computer was infected and my identity was going to be stolen
bowling for soup is a good band
some telemarketers are calling me and i'm not in the phonebook
I did all my job applications on this computer
because I always claim myself as a "Independant Contractor"
EH
Tip for you kids: Independant contractor = big tax savings
I'm not gonna argue that by any means
never call yourself an employee.
Can't be an independent contractor working at Walmart
thats true.
But for some jobs you can.
I also like country, heavy metal, and classical music
yeah.. course you dont have regulations being independent i dont tihnk
Country and 80s.
You still technically need to pay income tax
I just dont claim it.
Classic rock too*
a freelancer
I am not all to diverse
My bank acct has no ssn attached to it
mercinary of carpet
How is he a freelancer?
so no one knows the wiser.
A freelance mercenary with Star wars memoribilia.
I go from the heavier HIM songs to about eh
i listen to mostly rock/metal and techno/trance
Hahaha
wow, someone on irc that likes tecno.
And Bionicles
BFMV
techno*
One of the best bands ever
silver does too
My brother used to be into Bionicles.
He doesn't like them anymore
i thought it sorta looked stupid
reminds me of legos
lol
Completely different years though
Its like, a stripped down version of lego/knex
I still play with knex.
I remember those
I think we sold them all
Or maybe they're hidden somewhere in Evan's closet
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qsWFFuYZYI
have you seen the lego thing yet?
the 8bit movie
My internet was down when you linked to it, so no
Knex are actually used in education.
I love them.
its pretty incredible
freakin 1500 hours with legos.... dam thats a long time
Woah
yay knex in our games room http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/2010-06-05-17-47-54.jpg
lol
That's pretty cool
We did an animation thing like that in elementary school, only with clay figures
yeah the stopmotion thing
Nowhere near as cool as that though
Stop motion is awesome
I always wanted to animate stuff and make videos.
i always wanted to make a videogame
when i was little except then.. i figured out i had to know c++ and i gave up
I wish I'd remembered to back up the game I made
I always wanted to be an octopus.
lol
what?
So many hours of coding all wasted
:(
You dare question it?
What's with this new Youtube comment system?

Probably because the average Youtube comment is one of those three.

It's like Twitter
People don't even want to be bothered with writing their own comments anymore, all must be automated. xD
what is twitter anyway?
You just post statuses

They used to have a program where you had to apply to get in
04hey Sneas
02Sneas left
But they made it so everyone can be in it so people don't feel left out when they don't make it
04oh
04I thought he joined
/me facepalms
And so there could be more minorities, apparently
Oh, I get it. So it's basically one cut above, or honors, and then CC.
yeah, basically
hello
I'm implying that that was a stupid idea
2jfldjsavhoeifjld
they shouldn't have changed it just to keep some kids from feeling left out
I know, but if they had to make it non-apply that means minorities wouldn't have been able to because they lacked the skill.
2Hibari STILL needs to learn how to use a door
2D:<
maybe those kids who didn't get in should just work harder
04thank'ee for you critique Quan
Exactly
Or so it implies.
That's another reason it's stupid.
RCT1 is bess
But that was an actual reason they gave for doing it.
It's kind of funny, sinc e they're assuming minorities couldn't do it, and hence they're defeating the purpose by making it automatic.
maybe RCT2
I dunno
04lol
02;o
7Any mods here? D:
04I like RCT2
Yeah, makes no sense
04RTC3 was...meh
RCT2 was just a retool of RCT
04I've never played RCT1
04so RCT2 is my favourite
epic failure
04dunno

I couldn't care less about Justin Bieber, but fans like that make me want to cry
and then theres a comment where someone repeats the word "cu**" like 50 times.
Im in luv with his music, but it seems like he kinda seems like the stalkerish ex in this vid with the whole grapping her and her jacket, watching up, stalking her to a bowling alley with her friends. ludacris looks like hes choking him at the end while STILL tryin tob cool. oh and Y, whenï»¿ hes saying im gone ive moved on, does he walk out hand in hand with his "first luv"???

New Peak for this channel is 22 set on 06/06/2010
o.o
I thought I'd seen more than 22 people in here before
Yeah
It's been up to about 25 or so
It's because it's a new script, only just started recording numbers, so 22 is the highest it has seen.
Those peak things are everywhere
Lol
<.<
Is it really the 6th already?
What movie?
Yep
wow

Proto: At least you don't hold hands with the car beside you for five miles
I'd have hit one of them cars
Repeatedly
O_o
People did that?
Which is why I made it home so quickly
They didn't do it tonight!
lol
I usually just flash my lights, and if they don't move, I tailgate them
lool longest dinner evar
I'm a horrible driver
People always honk at me for waiting too long to cross intersections
Oh, that's fine :3
/me doesn't know the criteria for driving skill though
Or I would tell you mind
Elaborate.
mine*
i ate
and ate
then ate some more
02cocky boys
/me facepalms
then after all was done, I ate.
In terms of following the law, I'm about an 8/10
ate what?
sometimes I don't follow the laws because I don't know them
our neighbor is Japanese :P
>.>
sushi and that sort
lol cock
:S
lol
I hate those
D:
i'm technically a professional driver
I had that happen to me in the Spring
How much?
I speed (like everyone else) and drive outside the lines sometimes when it's safe, but I use turn signals and am nice to people who earn it :)
I got in an accident at an intersection last summer
a lot :S
:o
So I'm extra cautious about them now
Ouch >.<
/me hasn't been in an accident yet
Unless you count bump drafting
;)
lol
only thing i ever did was hit a deer some 14 years ago
/me has a cute kitty on his monitor

Hmm.
I like to be available
Most people stay on almost all the time.
And I just forget to turn off my computer sometimes
Well.
<censored> you know me
XD
02XD
Well, what have you been up to lately?
oh idk if i told you but
People who use proper clients anyway. XD
02o.o?
i'll be getting a new server soon
02:O
idk when but asap
and
Yeah, Mibbit'll probably just disconnect you after a while
02yeah I kinda noticed your post
02o.o
it'll be better than the POS one i had
02nice ;D
ah k
02so...what about services then?
well when i get it back online everything /normal
03He will have them back :3
Mibbit is perfectly fine! People rarely get kicked off the serv-
*Disconnected*
wb
03because me + services = 3:
ty..
np
D:
Well you got them up so :D
It was a <censored> getting them up XD
So anyways... What have you guys been doing?
02o_O
02how so? xD
Talking on other channels and being bored
02it's only installing anope 1.8.4 + replacing databases and modules
02xD
:P
o3o
That sounds fun...
Not really...
it's linking the services and unreal that can be a pain in the ass
/me wishes people would talk more
03yeah
02how so?
anyway i poof
02it's a pain when they're dif versions
02D:
because there are 9001 settings
02lol
02I can do it pretty quick
well
it's a pain when setting everything up first time
anyway bye
02(not mentioning the fact that I've had to do it quite a bi BUT DISREGARD THAT)
I would ask you why you talk on IRC channels all day, but then I remember, "Wait, Facebook is even worse"
02lol true
...
03All I had to do was comment out 1 line, and change a couple things but I didn't figure it out until hours later xD
02and it gives me I/O erros
02errors
o3o;
Sorry SR, just wanted to see who was actually online.
02for anope 1.8.3
02XD
OK
02which is a pain in the ass
http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5574.0 care to reply?
02;o
Im logged into irc usually all the time.
Just posted this
can't
Ill login when i go mobile too.
on phone
Why?
oh
02o.o
I rarely ever use online chats.
what phone?
03Can I have a triple boot system of Linux Mint, Fedora and XP?
iPhone
I always do.
o3o
If I have other things to do I will do them
:P
I'm trying to get into Twitter though, and yes I know Twitter is just a mini-blogger and not a chat site.
I like this though
But to me it counts as some sort of communication
You know there's going to be a new one in like 2 days
Twitter seems too much like a facebook type thing where you tell everyone what you're doing and see what other people are doing so I say no to that.
Pretty much all my online friends are here
03EW IPHONE
02o_O
well so is your face
03my Droid can open links >:P
02never tried
so can I
02I've only tried a dual boot system
03orly
02but that COULD work
03you just said you can't
Yep
I can confirm that
just don't wanna login
02but it'd eat up ram and yeah
Twitter is nothing like Facebook. On Twitter, you don't NEED to communicate with anyone
03...
03LOL fail
02you'd need a moderately powerful computer to do it
It's like pretending to listen to someone, but in your mind you're just flipping them the bird :P
02wb
More like public RSS feeds...
not to mention I my password doesn't ring a bell atm o3o
-I
03Considering my laptop's more powerful than this desktop, :3
I don't like Twitter
03Well, it has more RAM
I like communication to be instant
Its the same idea...
And Twitter seems really pointless to me
03But the processor on my desktop is better
You tell people what you're doing and you get updates on what your friends are doing.
03fail
just a really stripped down simple version.
02ah
02how much ram does your dektop have?
03'that's why you pick passwords that you can remember
02desktop*
It's like Facebook with just statuses
02it says 512mb on the VMware one
This is basically what it is, let me link it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN2HAroA12w
Watch that video, it's hilarious XD
Although then I guess you don't have to have your page spammed with Farmville crap
My internet is down
Dang
It's really funny...
"Into the Twittersphere!!!"
Might watch it tomorrow if I remember
it's not hard to remember, I just have a short list and forgot which one goes to tst because I have it auto login on my main comp
032GB overall
"Watching TV with my cat"
03512mb allocated for your VM
03:3
I kinda wished Kproxy worked with youtube videos
lol
I use lastpass :P
Man 1: "This is how our generation communicates! With trivial, bite-sized, yippity-yap!"
Man 2: "Okay, but I don't care what other people are doing every second of their lives"
5Hey Obsi!
"Yippity-yap"
03If I can get a spare desktop or something that can handle XP or something I could transfer your stuff to it and then you'd have an actual machine (which would be better I'd think xD)
Obsiiiiiiiii
lol
Lol
Man 1: "Neither do I, but I do care that OTHER people know what I'm doing!"
02ah :3
02yeah, xD
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh
the phone remembered the last time I said obsiiiiiiiii and added in that many i's o3o
02because VMware keeps getting screwed when there's too much activity
02and hai n2
why do aoo of you love using colors
*all
XD
I need to put together a pc quickly then.
Lol
That's why I turned autocorrect off
Don't you have... A server hosted already?
hihi
XD Kyu
i dont see the point of it
that's OK, only have to put up with this a couple more months anyways
Non-youtube link:
http://current.com/shows/supernews/89891774_twouble-with-twitters.htm
HAY
what's up
03We are colorful peoplez. :3
02xD
03-?
020,9At least it's not this, n2
02XD
Or is it just youtube?
Because only port 80 gets blocked
Can't you just forward the port?
:)
or maybe it's just cuz you're a dork that likes making fun of what other people like o3o
I don't know, how do you do that?
its a router block.
If you are only able to get through one port, then your router is messed up...
Let me find the port forwarding site...
Nah, my parents do it intentionally
03nah
03iPhones just plain suck, period
http://portforward.com/
that's also why I haven't been on spyroforum lately
parents blocked it
you just plain suck
Lol
Its a block put into the router for web access, its only blocking port 80.
Eh, that's not bad, Armaggedon.
13This, on the other hand...
04back
I don't get it though; it used to block everything
IRC too
04back
Why only port 80?
Proprietary software or hardware just plain sucks
/me runs
...because thats what its set at.
They don't want us on websites I guess
04AEROOOOOOOOOOOOO
But there are literally thousands of ports...
/me glompw
04glomps*
I'm finallyyyyyy back from projects
aerooooooooobar
and I had my promotion party today :D
02Some guy thinks I'm Asian lol
/me clings to Aero
hello aero-d
Well yeah
pooooost
/me licks Aero
Port 80 is regular web traffic.
bah :(
04wut
you know, you guys are gonna make me go back into scripting
But blocking port 80 effectively blocks most of what we use the internet for
/me enters in a puff of illogic
I think the only reason they didn't block 6667 too is because they don't know about it
So wait... What would a proxy help with if he can't get through the port anyways?
it's https
uses a different port
When I first started using computers... I never figured that "regular maintenance" would involve WD-40.
https is 443
Had to switch to !iPod touch. What did I miss?
07EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
04lol

Lol

I'm just glad I don't need to worry about networking until I take the Cisco classes next year XD
04are cool
02XD
02And I told him I wasn't and he goes
02that's fine, CR xD
02"You just FEEL Asian"
02it shows like 13this to me
02And then I just went silent o3o
You worry about networking when you have a networking problem.
02it's purple
02XD
The only networking I have to worry about is getting around my parents' stupid restrictions
03pink to me
And fun
I know enough about networking to fix common problems
02oh yeah, Shiny
02Pink to me too
02battle? xD
02battle? o3o
My dad manages all that stuff
02on Pokemon Online
02I want to try xD
And he doesn't like when I ask questions about it because he thinks I'll use the knowledge to get around his blocks
your dad is in IT right?
Yeah
He's a manager now
Maybe he left default password on the router config? XD
Works for Cargil
Aww.
02nuuu ;v;
I've tried
/me fears the competition
I hate IT workers. They never answer you directly and always say "Just let me handle that"
Put a key logger on his computer? :o
02I don't care about competition
XD
02I just want to have fun xD
Buffer overflow!
02I lose all the time and I don't really care
He'd kill me if he ever found out
Bye me :D
Then don't let him find out...
He would
Don't antiviruses find keyloggers?
Couldn't you just temporarily plug directly into the modem?
04I lose all the time
04and idc
PM
04I mean
04I really suck
04like
04REALLY
Somebody say something.

8D
The easiest way would just be to put a pen the hole that resets the router to factory defaults. XD
HAI
O
I was just checking if I took that ping timeout on my touch
HAI
it's obedience and disobedience at the same time!
02lol
...
But mostly obedience.
02you've beaten me twice I think
noooooo
I'm just gonna pretend I know what you're saying :P
Yeeeeeeeees
I best be leaving now.
Hmm, I feel like a phlegmatic old man, whose suspiring marks the epoch which is his death.

http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5574.msg206035#new reply to this if you get the chance. Just put the topic up.
Indubitiably, inasmuch the pseudo-complexity of this verbose bantering holds thespian value.
omg dari you should make a thesaurus bot
A sawyer commented upon my eristic attitude, I have to say that his comment, while malapert, is correct.
02all right hn
02:D
/me snugs Shiny
02you know the server etc. right? :3
02I'm waiting xD
Anyone know where I can find someone who is a good artist?
Anyway, see you all tomorrow.
Hai
:D
I realized I can't make anything that requires artistic skill...
:D
infa z
What's up
yeah
02well, wait till I finish this game, just one more level kk?
The archaic posterity of your proported comment, I will concede, snagged me in a most precarious vulnerability. What brazen ideaology strengthens this abnormal usage?
Something tells me he would be less that willing to help me.
*ideology
I think you are using the word "Archaic" incorrectly.
dari idk
=P
How so?
Archaic means old fashioned, like Dark Ages type old
Yes, as I meant it to.
Infact, the word Archaic is considered an Archaic word
I laughed when I found that out.
Excuse me, while I disport myself.
02ok :3
XD
:P
Just watching YouTube videos
Just got home from dinner :D
So guys...
Ask me a question
:P
just linked some people to some footage I got from the show last night too
How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
Exactly 4 and a half tons a year per inch of teeth
that's the first question that pops into my mind whenever someone says "ask me a question"
o___o
And because if a woodchuck could chuck wood would have 1.75 inches of teeth, then you do the math
02:O
A rodent such as that could masticate a salient quantity of wood, or so I would imagine.
Ask me another question
02XD
Why are you green?
because the green made me that way
12I was gone for MUCH longer than I planned...
:P
I ate too much broccoli
Next question
03HI
03and I noticed :P
12hai
hai
03I even got that DVD *and* returned it in the same day
/me runs
Do you like mudkipz?
12hai
03but that's normal for me
12and lolz
03rent, rip, return
03and since I had two trips
03in one day
03it worked perfectly
12nice
03I love having a car to drive LOL
*leik
/me puts LL into xenomorph suit
02I'm on there, so challenge away
Yes
12a wat

What it your outlook on the solecism that is so commonly seen on the internet?
late
o3o
03sigh
03I am about to rage at my cable company
dari's on a roll
12well
03that and this retarded TV tuner
Grammar-nazis pwn bad english spellers
03I actually do have a reason for hating ATI >_:>
03*>_>
That's my outlook
12o.o
03their stuff has broken on me *yet again*
12loldrf
I like that outlook
03But, ATI is the only place that makes digital cable tuners for PC :/
03the problem I was having
03was one of my channels had no sound
:P
03which is not ideal for watching LOL
Next Question
you find multiple irrelevant reasons to hate everything
04ohai LL
03Kyu, how is it irrelevant?
03the fact that the product is made by ATI
03and is broken
03is a good reason
I liked my Grammar_Police bot
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83WhLJf5_A4 this LL

12my friends are still here
12the party is going on all night o3o
D:
12so nu vids, k?

12lolz
All I know is that you can get most of the pokemon before you even get near the Pokemon league (trust me, I have it!!!!). They are all the same; except from the fact that you would see the Original Giratina instead of the one you see now(yes, I know. I have also asked the nintendo group but they said that the 'Other Form' is the one you see now in your Diamond and Pearl.)
03Sigh.
02that was fun ;o

BitTorrent is the global standard for delivering high-quality files over the Internet. With an installed base of over 160 million clients worldwide, BitTorrent technology has turned conventional distribution economics on its head. The more popular a large video, audio or software file, the faster and cheaper it can be transferred with BitTorrent. The result is a better digital entertainment experi

02o_O
Nopw
e
Which one didn't work?
All of them
I autovoice using flags in my channel
04Vote for my xat suggestion!! http://util.xat.com/vote/story.php?title=new-user-status
Should work
What ws that one more time
/cs flags #channel +v *!*@*
I can C/P in this Client
02apparently you could always do that
I think that's the right syntax
MOUNTAIN DEW
WTH is xat?
BITCHES
02but we never needed to, did we?
02I LIKE MOUNTAIN DEW
I HATE BOTTLED WATER
+V
not +v
3 MOUNTAIN DEW IS GODS CUM
DRINK TAP WATER, IT'S CHEAPER!
Two entirely different flags
I can't stand the taste of bottled water anyway.
02o.o
And actually, the mode comes last
It's bitter.
Tap water is sweet.
Hehe, that too :3
*!*@*, then the mode
/me didn't notice that :3
I get this
eww tap water ftl
Anyway, WTH is xat?
04well vote for this one 0.o: http://util.xat.com/vote/story.php?title=me-command
02._.
02I should spam filter that
Usage: FLAGS #channelname [target] [flags]
Yeah, that's because I typed it wrong
it should be
/cs flags #channel *!*@* +v
+V +V +V +V +V
xD
But I'm pretty sure it worked for me with +v
+v allows people to have access to voice/devoice commands
Perfect!
Hmm
Maybe I should fix that
!devoice
!voice
!unvoice
lol
Hmm
How do I make it list the flags?
Actually
!op
!deop
You have +o set for *!*@*
Yeah, I set +o too to test it
Just a minute ago
Okay...it says they were set
/cs flags #channel <------ to list
Hm
I did use capital V
Perfect
:D

I got tons of spam in my trash though
No idea where it comes from
03anyway, off to bed../.

04yeah butts but
i mean
hi
04you get the point
14lol
04Spyro looks like he's in pain
-!- A single-lens reflex (SLR) camera is a camera that typically uses a semi-automatic moving mirror system that permits the photographer to see exactly what will be captured by the film or digital imaging system (after a very small delay), as opposed to pre-SLR cameras where the view through the viewfinder could be significantly different from what was captured on film. (The Canon Pellix film camera was an exception wherein th
fixed beamsplitting pellicle.)

14Also, nothing wrong with being a Virtual Pimp
so, what you see through the crosshair is EXACTLY what will be captured. Plus you can take so fancy things like long-shutter pictures

this incredibly light line there is the Market Street....the road every other leads to and you won't be able to leave anymore until you're on the Bay Bridge...
14Wow that's awesome! o.o
04and the reason I did an IrresxLia shortstory instead of CynderxSpyro is because I know Irres' and Lia's personalities better
02Espeon is an awesome sweeper
02319 speed and 394 sp attack
02= win
02and 200+ sp def :D
14I'd one shot kill it :P
I'm awesome, of course.
02it makes it awesome even to Alakazam's shadow ball
04hurr
04Gengar can pwn it
02which is SUPER EFFECTIVE
lovely city, yet the most expensive in the entire united states (not my info, but the info of a motel clerk we spoke to). And the city I paid the most for a car park....20 dollars for half an hour oO
02and Alakazam has really good sp atk
14Alakazam sucks
14lol
02it depens xD
14No dependation at all
14Alakazam sucks
14XD
02XD
02I'll battle, Drake? xD
14Good if you want an original pokemon battle (meaning the first 150)
14But compared to the new Psychic pokemon
14Yeh
14You get the point XD
02I'm hoping Zekrom is Dark/Dragon
02though it's prolly electric/dragon
14Oo
02;;
i'm hoping they're a joke
i mean
hi
14Ovo*
14That's... well
14Stupidly expensive
02and I'm hoping Reshiram is psychic/dragon
02.-.
14Oh god new legendaries
14How many new pokemon is there now x-x
04lol
too many
the cheapest room btw. was in Las Vegas. We paid for a room with two Kingsize beds just 19 dollars per night. Simply wow^^
they should have stopped long ago and just made more eeveelutions
*cough*
14XD
14They'll make more eeveelutions
14We know it, they know it, everyone knows it
02Drake, i want a Dark/Dragon pokemon D:
14What were the rooms like?
well tbh i hope they don't fuck them up like they've done with EVERYTHING ELSE
02even if it has over 9000 weaknesses, it'd still be win
02<3
04lol
14I has a Ghost/Dragon :o
02Ghost/Dragon Giratina lol
14Yeh XD
02Dark/Dragon is cooler xD
14Giratina is strangely hot >>
02because Giratina still gets pwned by my Espeon and that's saying something
04hot?
the room was great. Free ice, air condition, fresh, new beds - would have stayed there even longer if we hadn't planned to go ahead to San Francisco.
14My Giratina would pwn yo XD
02both O forme and normal
/me brings out Gengar
14Nice o.o
02lol, what speed?
02Gengar would kill Giratina hands down
14Er
14Wrong
14XD
02Shadow Ball + STAB
02with Gengar's sp atk and speed
14Gengar never gets the first attack against Giratina :P
04Giratina Normal forme is a wall
02it depends
04Giratina Origin Forme...I don't know. An attacker?
14Gengar LV 78 VS my LV 72 Giratina
02it has slightly better speed and atk
02lol it's lv 100 vs lv 100
14My Giratina one hit KO'd Gengar
14Shadow Force 8D
04give Gengar protect
/me shot
02lol shadow force
02you switch out to Blissey
02and pwn it that way
14Blissey
04sucks
14Take down with earthquake or brick break
04its only good point is its HP
14lol yeh
04and it is a PAIN to level up
02or well, Snorlax
04especially without EXP Share
14Snorlaz is a tank >:(
04that's what I had to do on Diamond once
02Salamence <3
14Snorlax*
04>.>
14Salamence is <3
04Umbreon
04is a staller
02Snorlax is a fucking pain
14NS, brick break
04Brick Break
04...
14xD
0437&
0437%
04...
04FFFF
04^re-enactment
02Espeon would still be faster than Giratina
14I know
02Giratina's max speed is 306
02and gengar would be faster too
14Mine has 373
04mmm
04wut
02o_O
04h4x
02what
04wait
14Nature lol
04Origin or Another form?
14and a lot of vitamins
14Origin
04oh
04I see
04thats why
14I have a pokemon that has 493 Sp. Def
14XD
02lol
02ah origin form
02that probably has better stats
02but normal forme would fall to Espeon and Gengar
14Depends on the defence tbh
04I wish I could draw digitally
04I need to practice with my tablet
02Gengar's max speed is 350
14brb
02k
04k
k
04Gengar has the highest base speed of all Ghost POkemon
04110 I think it is
02o.O
02Espeon and Gengar have the same base speed and sp atk
/me draws
any one here?
or i mean any one on?
hello...
hrm, do you think he got the point here now? http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5570.0
02Espeon is still damn powerful
-he +she
uhhhh
04its a sweeper
04like my Pikachu
sorry if i don't say anything, but i quite frankly don't know shit about pokemon stats and all that and i'm happy with that
so yep
04the only downside to Pikachu is since it isn't a final tier Pokemon, it misses out on the higher stats of other POkemon
02yeah
02max speed is 306
04which is why your Espeon can pwn it
02and then with that, 198 sp atk but with light ball it'd be 396
02it's basically out in 1 hit
02it's in my electric team
02pwned 4 pokemon with it
04lol
02well max 199 sp atk
02meaning 398 sp atk
02with light ball
02but you could probably get a support team for it
02with tailwind
02to speed bump
02or get ninjask or similar
02and baton pass
02after a few turns of speed boost
02and sp atk boost
02then it'd be the ultimate killing machine
04lol
02at that rate it'd sweep a whole team
04Surf, Thunder and Flying Hidden Power
14nice post lol
02even better if rain dance is in effect
04pwnage
02XD
02not fly though
04yeah
02since that's physical
02and you're basing it on special attack
02thunderbolt would be win
02you could probably take Rain Daince off your pikachu and give it thunderbolt
04mmm
02that would be WIN
04lol
14But yeh I reckon you got the point across :)
04I'm drawing you now NS
02lol
02can you give me the pic, Drake?
group pic thing will be win

12All we have is rain
12No thunder
12and it's light rain
stronger rain here
but it's a bit of a delight in fact. Was becoming too warm
and muggy
14Modifying .DAT files is annoying >v>
14Also late welcome back Arti XD
12v___v
12Xai's just left
14:<
/me hugs
12Now I have nothing to do again all night..
/me hugs back
12I hate his stupid late shifts on weekends
14Well I'm here all day and all night ovo
14Random chats FTW?
12Yeh except.. it gives me terrible RSI
14There's always the phone :)
12I might go walking later
12I just don't want to be sat down all night
14Ah
Back
14wb
hi
ty
Arti: I got a late shift on friday. From 4pm to midnight
then my co-worker will come and take over til 7am
12Not too bad
12D:
12wow
12now THATs bad
well, gotta look at July...
shift 1: 4pm to midnight, shift 2: midnight to 8am, shift 3: 8am to 4pm - back to shift 1
12Ovo;;;;;;
from friday 4pm through monday 6am
12Why?
maintenance window for our datacenters
12Argh
and we're the key-management to coordinate all the workings
because we have specialists for Windows-systems, Unix-Systems, Linux-Systems, VMware ESX-Systems, Network, Infrastructure, Comm-networks, Security, Electronics....
and of course: applications
every department needs to be coordinated if their workings affects the others. Like: If you want to patch a Windows System, you need power and access to the memory arrays - and you need to login through the network onto the machine. So you can't take down either network or power or memory banks for mantenance
and our biggest problem: The soccer world cup. Many communication systems need to stay online during that weekend for emergency reaction reasons. That's why we need fallback systems for everything - even whilst we're working at everything

14Lol Lugia
So, what do you want to do Arti?
03o.o
0318:28 remaining
12I want to be outside walking..
12But not alone
6Spyro rocks are you on?
Meeps, you should try and make friends with one of your naigbours...
or however that is spelt >>
0315:58 remaining
12They're all like 50+ Ovo
12Also.. one thing you need to know about England.. you DONT make friends with neighbours..
orly
12they are your acquaintances
Meeps... so no massive street BBQ's...?
http://www.kno.com/the-kno.html
12No Ovo
12You have BBQs in your garden and the neigbours can just sit and watch from a distance....
(I have BBQ's w/ neighbors.)
12Weird
12Should I say "Unusual"
12Unless you're a kid who has friends next door or whatever.. but it doesn't work with adults
Heh, one more reason not to move to the UK ^^'
12They keep to themselves
I'm under the impression that not knowing your neighbor tends to be a symptom of living further south or in cities.
And all of my neighbors are retired. o-o
12OH RIGHT soo you'd rather stay in a country where your mother has to carry around a cattleprod!!!
12BF
I don't live in the country. :<
12I never said I didnt know my neighbours, I mean we borrow tools from our next door neighbour all the time and say hi
12But we;re not "friends", we dont go to each other's houses or go out together.....
Well, not being friends with your neighbors, then.
6hello?
12No thats just an England thing
12Only in very unusual cases do neighbours actually get along enough to be like best friends or something!
And Articuno, I never said I didn't want to move, just that the UK, well, I like thwe weather there, but not most of the people ^^'
12We're sensible
12and things get personal, and then you're stuck with it
I'll keep that in mind then...
12Ok take this for an example
12My parents became good friends with next door and then one day, my parents decided to try and build a (very poor) brick wall between the houses just because they wanted a wall there, no hidden motive. Anyway they didn't ask the neighbours what they thought of it.. and because the neighbours expected this kind of communication and never got it, they became angry and started ignoring my parents and to this day they have no idea why
12But me and Xai already figured it out :/
err... yes, but something like that, you usualy inform your neighbour about, even if you don't talk to them at all...
12I think my parents just took them for granted because of being friends....
That is just commen decency, sorry to say...
12Yes but my parents are stupid like that, they never even finished the wall so it's two bricks tall, uneven and just ruins both front gardens
mrr
kick it down
12They just assumed that it would be fine because next door are such good friends and wouldn't possibly mind
035:18 remaining
/me 7comes back to seeing a wall of blue and black on chat.
12It's funny how it works, if it was a stranger they would have been worried about treading on thin ice and asked first.
7No prob's. ;3
/me nods at Articuno...
12Anyway there've been other cases where my friends have had their neighbours baby sitting and arguments have started and soon enough you can't even walk out the door without feeling awkward
12I think you should just keep personal things away from neighbours.
14I agree with Arti tbh
Sneas
Can I has PM help?
14I've had a few problems with neighbours when things get personal (heh still do in fact)
12D:
12Also Lugia..
14I tend to be social towards neighbours and nothing more
14Thunderstorm is here
12Lucky, still not here
14Getting a few good rumbles, if it gets better I'll get some vids
I want a thunderstorm...
03I guess? o.o

12LOL
If I move anywhere for long term, it would be Australia
12and be behind a great firewall? Ok
12:>
a great firewall? ovO
12Like they have in China..?
12Internet is restricted
Australia sounds alright, but it does seem to be brown-nosing China a bit.
They don't have that in Australia as far as I know ovO
12Yes they do
We know a couple of people that moved there ^^'
12How long ago?
A few months ago
was the last time I talked to them, but they have been there for about 2 years ^^'
12and they didnt mention all the firewall stuff?
I guess there might be one, but not as bad as China
12No but getting there
12Like wanting to filter out certain results from Google etc.
6is any one on?
6like right now?
I need to read up on that, since I know why CHina do that, but why would Australia...?
6Spyro Rocks i THINK i need ur help
12Well, why would England >v>
6uhhh
child prawn and terrorists
Because you have strange politicians...
14Anti-Piracy crap
12Actually it may be slightly different here
12It's money here
12Over there it's control
Okay, so where would you sugest moving then Arti?
I mean, staying here is not an option ^^'
12Here of course :D
14inb4 leeds
/me shot
12England is by far the best country
lol
12:D
Say the one about the Digital Econemy act ;>
I wouldn't even be able to take pictures!
12Thats not true
12That part of the act was completely removed
14Wow it's really come over dark here ovo
So it is better now...?
12and the rest will only really target users the way you were targetted by your ISP
lol
12Somewhat yeh.. but it might even get taken off with our new government
So that is a slight bright side ^v^
12Half who oppose it and the other half.. aren't bothered as far as I know..
that reminds me, I need to tell my parents that I received a random call about a PHP programer opening ovO
brb
12Oooh
12Lol hi
12?
failure!
pressed the exit button XD
12LOL
14fail
What a mistake to tell my parents >>
12..
12What happened..?
They want me to call them, found out what they offer and if it is more they want me to take it >>
/me pokes them
12Uhh
12Thats what ANYONE would say XD I was even going to say you should take it if it's better than your current job
/me runs
My dad can very easily ramble on about stuff I don't care about, especially if he had something to drink >>
lol Articuno...
I wouldn't want to leave my work in a mess, if they had more developers and I wasn't so important, then sure
But currently I am the best eprson there considering programming >>
12XDD
12The higher up you are in the company.. the less you do *runs*
But then again, I don't get payed so much ever XD
LOL!
12brb#
I can't confirm that for our company Arti
in fact - the higher you are, the more overtime you're supposed to take without demanding extra salary
Well, I just want my experience, then I want to work an easy going job ^^'
Wow...empty
so BBC Radio Oxford has a jazz show
/me jealous
o_o
o_o
14o_o
http://bookseer.com/
That's nifty XD
14I'm off guys
14Going round a friends
14Cya ^^
blah >>
All I get on bookseer.com is XML errors XD
greetings Lugia and everyone!
I got those when I typo'd Terry Pratchett's name, but aside from that it's been fine for me.
Hihi.
They aren't validating the XML, or their constructor has been modified, either way, bad coding
heh
k, another step is done, one last step remaining
I just paid for funeral and mason
I have to do a 'systems analysis' for an imaginary shed company in preparation for my ICT exam... if it weren't for the fact I've done this work last year it would be quite interesting.
funeral? :S
my mum's funeral
oh
Hello
Hey
Someone is alive!
:P
12Back
What's up?
eep
12eep
Just talking to someone in another channel
you?
Ahh...
Trying to not suck at 3d modelling
/me now belongs to Espeon for 14 minutes
:3
:p
hi
lolz
!espeon
XD
!!!
/me 7headdesks
7I feel my sprites are inferior. O_o
Yea, I think I'm gonna give up on this pretty soon...
With the 3D modeling?
yea
i
I can't do it
Well blarg
I lost my cell phone somewhere
Call it
The battery is dead
XD
I think I have some sort of wierd electro static power...
Every electronic I carry with me I never have to charge
I never needed to charge my iPod, and my phone is on all the time
Hm, weird
Wish my stuff was like that
I never remember to charge anything
Aha, here it is
/me watches Espeon sniff her o-o
12better than mine
Yea, I can't do this...
12ultimately there is always room for improvement though if you allow it
12*though
02Hi! ^^
7Hey, Icy!
/me grins, she always does
Hello all
12hi
7Brb; lunch.
12murr
/me thinks she smells slightly of Espeon as well, but that's just because he just pressed himself against her like that :P
How are you?
02I'm surprised that I got a comment from Arti on my Lugia picture. I never expected it to be that good. o_o
Bad
I can't do it
Can't do what?
3d modelling
I am on the modelling part of my game, but I completely suck at anything artistic
7Back.
7Didn't each lunch yet; just put it in the oven. o3o
That sucks
You need Alcest
Alcest?
Who/What is a Alcest?
7No?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrrLb-uJQ
7May I see? :3
02It's in TST's fanart. =3
Umm...
How does that help me?
7Ah.
7Well, from a critical standpoint, it probably needs anatomical and lighting improvement. o3o
02Yeah, I'm still learning. ^^;
Helps you relax
It works for me
7Saw the Lugia tutorial on TST?
I am relaxed
I just suck at art
7Oh, and nice eyes.
So do I
02Kinda. >.> My internet was screwing up last night.
Do you have a Tablet?
Sort of
A really bad and old one
Hmmm
I think you need a new one XD
02^^*
Look at me, captain obvious
7That's good. :)
02Besides, everyone has their own art style and I'm happy with mine. =3
I can't even describe what I am thinking in words...
7I suppose, but style doesn't mean anatomy can be all over the place. :P
03yay
/me 7flees?
SR... I think you should give up for a few minutes.
I'll wager it isn't pleasant
/me has satellite TV now
Lol, I see some funnel clouds forming a few miles from my house
/me 7is floofed. O_o
Probably gonna be hit by a tornado XD
Oh
Fuck
Tornado warnings for the entire state of NH
/me goes to play The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon
Lol XP
Pack your PC and get the hell out and dodge
I should really head to my basement now, shouldn't I?
Doesn't help that I am on the 3rd floor of my house
2nd*
Thunder is loud =P
oh my
/me blushes
"Extreme severe weather warning for southern and middle NH"
http://www.wunderground.com/severe.asp
:3
/me squeaks.
you know that only makes you cuter, right? :P
I won't get a tornado where I live though
If a tornado forms around here, the mountains will kill it off quickly
yes
you're such a tease
Hola Vulcan
14Hey. :3
/me yawns excessively in the next person's facial region.
lol
XD
Espeon's a pimp :O!
/me RUNS
Meh.
Did you know, that the UK gets more tornados than the US?
shush
Really?
>:3
That is strange, especially since we have Tornado Alley
7*DORK*
:3 Mornin'
lulz
o-o
yawn
or if not then let me be the one bothering her :3
XD
:< My fur is all messy. I need to get it shaved short.
how is people?
Hello?
Please tell me my internet didn't die
gud
XD
Yep, my internet died
/me pounces an Espeon.
I wish this would auto-disconnect me when my internet fails
So I am not talking to myself like an idiot
am I still connected?
no, you've been kicked from the server
this is just your conscious talking
lol
ok, that was scary...
there's a thunderstorm going on over here,
/me 14yawns.
and damn, I think a lightning bolt struck right in our street!
XP Lightning doesn't bother me unless it's like within a mile
I hate when pages have the dialouge boxes that don't let you leave the page
14same here. Hate those. ~.=.~
I know, lightning is a dangerous beauty, but I actually felt the shock of the impact
They're more to the west, I think
I like Europe
/me paws at Absol pointy metal thingies
I kind of doubt the UK has more tornadoes than the US though
Nice and clean
For one thing, the US has way more surface area
Tornado Alley included!
Exactly.
Yeah
Minnesota
It's true though, I read the report by meterologists
14You have to realize it's all about climate. In the UK, you got the chilled weather from the east, and the warm sea air from the west.
14It's the same thing like Tornado alley.
I'm usually skeptical
Ugh, now I have to remember
Doesn't really matter though
Oh yay, thunder outsite
*outside
Yeah, I guess. Lucky you
We got nothing
But heat
o3o
14The only thing we get here in NY is a storm or two. A few years ago a Blue-moon rare Tornado actually hit us here in Brooklyn, but it was one that hasnt been seen in 100 years or so.
/me paws back at Espeon tail.
14since*
That's the one thing I'll miss about South Africa
Thunderstorms
Tornado + Oil Spill + Match = Awesome
+ BP executives being thrown in
And very dangerous
Tornadoes don't appear at sea =P
What spouts
Other wise it is called something else
*water
Exactly
Water spouts
But water spouts still only appear over lakes most of the time
I am angry at BP
/me wiggles
14Who isnt?
my family lives in that area
I say we take each BP executive, gag them, and put them inside the oil spill
The hot air they give off will make their heads become large and clog the spill
Lots of people who have fishing-related careers are going to lose their jobs
Not to mention all the wildlife that's being harmed
Anyone think about nuking the oil spill?
Uhhh... no
14I heard somewhere that because of it 70 Pelicans died, but they saved 60. >>
/me nibbles Absol forehead thing
I'm sure it's a lot more than 70
Why not nuke the oil spill?
http://dvice.com/archives/2010/06/nuking-the-oil.php
The spill has been going on for more than a month
14It's growing that for sure.
14They just recently capped it and it is looking like it is working.
Well, that's good
We must nuke it!
Too late though <.<
Blow them up and shut it down!
Can we nuke it anyways?
uhh... no
14No...too close.
Aww...
14and a Stupid Idea.
Nukes solve everything though!
Unless you like nuclear radiation and killing people
No man, no problem!
14even a tactical Nuclear warhead will still create fallout
14Poison the water supply there too, I will add.
War solves all man's problems: No man, no problem.
As if it's not poisoned enough by the oil
H-bomb?
14You basically do that, you have a risk of killing and poisoning more...you're creating more of a problem
14Bombs wont solve anything...even though they cause Wicked cool explosions.
14Indeed.
Back!
Pay no mind, no one special here...
12Hello, everyone.
14you should see what happens to yourself if you get Radiation poisoning..>>

14I would see Russia doing that kind of a bombing fixture, since most of their land is Frozen Wasteland...
12Yes, keep calling me that, Real_Man.

yeah I'm really pathetic if I dream about spyrochat but who gives a shit
Byes
:P
morin
Haha, that's happened to me before
(Say no.)
/me hugs various Templars of the Sky Temple
I don't know shit about the oil spill so idk

We're gonna see Prince of Persia. :D
Say yes! For the lulz!
12What? Not talking?
no just tired :D
4chan invasion
:P
What?
"for the lulz" reminds me of *chans
12Too tired to press a few buttons?
Pfft! Who cares about NATO! The only country that even supported us with it was the UK!
Did any other country help us in the Middle East? No.
They all chickened out and decided to drop their Nato agreement
oh jeez haha

14I'd like to see you withstand one of those Warhead being detonated with you standing on the coast. >.=.>
wow im bouncing like crazy today.
I will!
You wanna know why?
hey Proto
sup
nothing
I like plastic bags I make little ghetto kites out of them :(
lol
14Because your ego is bigger then your mind and body combined?
Because everyone knows that you can't explode yourself underwater
You're using the wrong definition of ego...
And yes, I did use bad grammar
UK FTW!
I don't know about /banning/ them, but I think people should use more reusable bad
HOLY SHIT
*bags
Oh wiat
12Works ok on Chrome though
*wait
Ban them!
Sometimes these stores make me buy reusable bags, I just throw them out when I get ome.
Overpowered?
12Nerf them now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!11!!one!!1!11eleven!!1!1
home*
14They really shouldnt ban plastic bags, just encourage and phase them out with more recyclable resources.
Only by RDX, and he's no here right now
:P
12Not*
Ohhh
:P
[censored]
/me feels like making more ghetto kites now
Aww, I hate you too. :)
What?
12I hate all of you.
My friend has a ghetto mailbox
/me 14stretches out and curls body up some, getting more comfortable for this.
^
14~.=.~
make ghetto kites out of plastic bags
:D
Anyway, I think Survival of the Fittest in the RP section has died so I think I'll start up a new one, one that isn't so overly compliacted with rules and plot
12You're overly complicated.
Which is kind of strange, since ghetto cities don't even HAVE mailboxes...
14Just boxes alone?
they get all da mail on the street man just axe them
14or not even boxes?
:(
Fine
lol
No...
Guys, the mail goes into a mail slot in the door...
I'm joking you. Perhaps you could help me with an idea for an RP?
12Rage moar.
whatevs dawg
I was thi nking dragons vs wolves but I actually think wolves are outnumbered on this site so that wouldn't work too well.
:o
I don't really RP
12It's called fire breath.
I should suggest that to Randy, then
:P
rp sux
o.O
14o.=.o;
no u
Me neither but I cant just start up a fiction to keep the site active so an rp is the only solution I can see.
RANDOM: http://www.explosm.net/comics/2071/

:D Hooray!

Pfft, I already have super powers
I like to post random things
12I have a superpower.

He lived about 20 minutes away from me
wtf is he dead *cries*
14Anyways, He just got busy?
He comes and goes
7it'd be ironic if it were from some spleen-related injury
He used to be an op on here

Sorry, something happened

Ah, I've had an interesting idea too, how about one of those choose your own adventure style stories? I write a chapter, then give the audience three choices of what would happen next, then write the next chapter based around that

How can I love someone that doesn't exist?
My super powers allow me to disown you anyways
12You disowned him...
12And now you're denying his existence!
You never owned me in the first place. ;)
I've always owned you Dari

BS, anyway I've got to go.
12I owned you.
12Does that count?
/me is unsnipeable
12You took pictures of him and showed them to us.

Don't let him find me here
12Yeh ok
/me wiggle
12I like my current look so there
03I guess it's just the hair
03well obviously it's up to you :P
7change your name and de-op yourself
03I'm just saying
Hmm
Nah
12Yeh well, you've said it enough times :>
03k
:o
12But to be honest thats one of my fav photos
12Thats why it's on my TST profile
03yeah
03I just think the long curly hair looks cool
12Yeh I like having curly hair..
7why is Fresh gunna kill you?
12I can still do that at this length
03so why'd you straighten it, work?
Because he wants admin in #draconicwolves
7ah
12I dont straighten it XD
12It's just like that
7of course, it could be said he's already killing you considering it's him that told me to join SC
03oh
12All I do when I get up from bed is comb it XD
03well some of those pictures have your hair straight
03oh XD
03my sisters have to use straightening irons on theirs
man we had strong wind passing by. knocked out the power and there are branches everywhere
12Er.. like nearly all of them
Oh, that's how you got here
12Mine's just naturally straight
:o
/me eats it
I'll have to pay him back for that one
Nah, im just a big baby with an inferiority complex, I just don't like having people above me, probably due to some far off childhood trauma or something...probably something
03heh
12I think curly hair suits me better XD
:D
03so do you intentionally curly it then?
03and yeah so do I :P
12Yes
12XD
03ah
03k
weeeeeee, swiveling!
12But..
03my hair's just short
03so XD
12My mum used to do it for me D:
03I actually got a haircut yesterday
12I can't do it myself D:
03my mom somehow thinks my boss won't like me with long hair
03which of course is complete BS
12LOL
03she's such an idiot
:D
12LOOOL
03"You're dressing up, you should shave"
03I'm like
03what if I wanted a beard?
03that's my choice, isn't it?
12LMAO
03nobody said dressed up has to be clean shaven, right?
Don't make her feel better, she doesn't deserve it!
03same with short hair
03nobody cares but my mom
But she's just so darn cute!
Prove it!
^_^
/me points to facebook
I disowned my facebook, I have 78 friend
s
I think I have 61
So you beat me
:P
Byes
HA!...but most of mine is family
I deleted a lot of people I don't talk to though
People who I never talk to in real life would just add me
I should but I wont, I'd feel guilty
I just remember that they probably only added me to make themselves seem more popular
Add as many friends as possible
03hm
So they have a /huge/ list
03Articuno, what exactly do you do at your job? I'm just curious
Like the Borg then
03I'm probably freaking out over nothing... but I've never had like a normal 9-5 job
xD
what's that?
03and somehow I'm thinking I'm not gonna be able to do anything besides work for the rest of the summer...
You will be assimilated! Resistance is futile!
:D
/me hugs Espeon :)
12Well
I'll ask him
You do that
If he ever gets back here...
Yeah, so I can turn him against you and your evil schemes!
:O
I have evil schemes?
INTPs don't have evil schemes
12I come in, logon to computer and phone, answer calls from frantic doctors about their software not working properly, fix it and fix any other problems on our "list" in between calls, some people just open tickets online instead of calling us
You're thinking of INTJs
:3
Haha
12I get a 10 min break in the morning, 40 min lunch and 10 min break in the evening
03hm
03so it's more of a desk thing?
12I don't have any internet access but I email people
12Yes
03I mean, I noticed you had time to use your phone :P
What are those?
03I'm hoping I'll get to do that too
12Well only on late shift or on breaks
03all I know is it's for a computer company
12Late shift is a bit different
03hm
http://typelogic.com/intj.html
12But it only comes a few times a year
03well I probably won't have 'lunch' breaks
12Why??
03because I'm taking a class in the morning
03that goes til noon
12Ovo
03so I won't even start work til then
12So no 9-5 tyhen?
03so I'll just get lunch before coming in
12*9-5
03well
12*then
12XD
They're the personality type of all the Disney villans that were the most believable
03it'll be 9-5 for the next... 2 weeks
03my class starts on the 28th
12Ahh
03but once my class starts
It seems complicated and I'm tired so I'll just agree
03I'll probably just eat lunch before coming in
xD
03my dad was saying I should make a lunch, but nah
I'm pretty agreeable when tired
03if they don't have some sort of cafe there I'll go a day without food
:D
It worked!
Told you
03I'm probably freaking out about nothing, right?
03I mean, the summer camp job was fun because I was actually doing something I liked
12Everyone does on their first 9-5
03you mean the first few days or the entire time>? LOL
:D
12I mean everyone panics right before they start
12It takes some time to get used to
03ah
03OK
12It was horrible, but.. intensive training was worth it I guess, now I'm a pro :>
03XD
03I'm just panicking right now
03because I start tomorrow
03I'm HOPING it's actually getting to work on computers
03I know their company does all sorts of things
Ah ^v^
03from servicing computers to selling them
03if they have me install software or something
03that'll be fine
I feel so content right now.
03I guess that's the other reason I'm freaking out
03I don't exactly know what I'm gonna be doing
03as my mom arranged the job for me, I didn't apply for it
03so it could be anything, really :/
12DRF it's ok, I felt the same way, I was literally starting from 0 knowledge of the software I had to work with and the procedures in doctor's surgeries
03OK
Hey Articuno
12You'll be shown what to do if you've never done it before
03I wish that would make me feel better :/
12Me too..
03I guess I'll just have to find out tomorrow
03what I'm in for
03I mean
03the only good thing
03is money XD
and work experience
How are you Articuno?
03eh
03well yes experience, but if it's doing computer work
03that's kinda trivial to me anyway
12Im fine thanks, really need to get up off the computer though
03I'm hoping that's what they have me do
03as I'm good on it
03... LOL
I find people end up in the most interesting places
that's good to hear arrti.

03well
03I usually stay up late and sleep in
03but that was because there was nothing to do in the morning
03since most of my IRC friends are in school :P
5I'm a night owl too but I'd go to bed at 9 and wake up at 4 for a job.
12DRF, I hate sleeping in because I waste half the day
03so I'd just sleep in and get up later
03well
7My internal clock pokes me to wake up at 7:30.
12If I get up at 9am I can spend an entire day out with the sunlight
03if you're still awake the same number of hours
03what diff does it make
12Err
03more like 8
12Say you got up at 12pm?
03right
03I usually do
0312 or 1PM
12That leaves you with like.. 4 hours sunlight in Winter
5Luckyyy you at least have a joooooooooob.
03and?
12..
03I don't go outside, remember?
/me runs
03my room has lights
12LOLZ
12Well I do.
03I don't see a problem
lol
03well yeah, I don't
12You should.
03not to mention it's summer
03LOL
go to the pool
03there's nothing to do DO
o-O
03-do
12People who stay in put on more weight due to lack of Vitamin D
03eh
03swimming is boring
03...LOL
03I'm overweight, so what
swimming is not boring :C
03it is to me
12I friggin' love swimming
03though I can do epic cannonballs
03since I'm so heavy :P
12But mostly I go walking.
5I think swimming's okay.
5I prefer walking or jogging.
7Meh, swimming.
03walking is boring unless you're actually going somewhere
12and you definitely need light to go walking in hills
03and I have a car
5Or biking~!
03why walk?
7Overexposure to it made it boring. :/
03I'm more of a practical person
Yeah same with Arti o.o
03why do something if it's not really accomplishing anything?
12Walking IS practical
5Wow DRF. xD
03orly
7Your health?
12Erm
12For fun?
03eh
03my fun involves computers :P
12Thats like saying why are you on TST? XD
5Walking = Practical because it keeps you alive because it promotes healthiness?
03as for exersize, if I WERE to, I'd just use the treadmill
03as then I Could watch TV at the same time :LP
03-L
12Lame
03how is that lame?
5Arti, I do that. xDD
03there's really nothign to do outside
12I don't know how you don't get depressed staying indoors, I can't go a single day without stepping outside
7Do you ever enjoy nature? o3o
12No he doesn't Quan
03I don't find meaningless walking fun
5I go on the treadmills at the YMCA and ellipticals so I watch TV. xP
03no I don't

5We have pork chops in my house too often.
7They're made from sheep intestines.
5I get sick of it.
7Well, they used to be. :P
Hot dogs are excellent
12XD
5So I sometimes wish I lived on the coast so that seafood was cheaper. ;;
lol idc about the meat o.O
07lol
12Ew I do D:
hmm
12Hotdogs contain the most screwed up bits of pig..

12What are they?
5What are Chitterlings?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitterlings

12..........
7I had a version which tasted like Peking Duck.
07by the time it takes seafood to get 300 or more miles inland, it's not fresh anymore o3o
7It was delicious!
12WHY DO PEOPLE EAT GUTS? FFS XD
12Sooooo stupid XD
7Only slightly smokier.
5Oh nasty-looking.
I won't touch them, however my dad made them once
07lol

5Arti, have you seen that show "Bizarre Foods"?
7Feh.
5Or anyone else?
12Nope
7I, for one, love 'em.
7And other weird foods, but we've gotten to this conversation before.
12Guts are for the poverty stricken :D
5Dude, the guy that travels around to all these different countries eats some WEIRD stuff.
/me runs
Good cause I can't even get over the smell xD
07you eat the guts because otherwise you're wasting food o3o
07and lol Arti
07that is true o3o
7Hot dogs are made from that sorta stuff, you know.
5Like rotting shark.
12....
07that doesn't mean you can't make them taste good
well, considering half of my family is redneck...
lol
7It's miscellaneous meat and spices.
12Yeh thats a delicacy I hear..
5In some country.
5Which I can't remember the name of. D:
rotting shark what?!
12Quan, exactly, thats why I dont eat hot dogs.
7I don't like them because they look so synthetic.
07beef tongue <3
12Altair yes, cant remember what country but they actually bury shark for like.. a month or more then dig it up and cook it
7Other sausages, on the other hand..
5Rotting Shark isn't in hotdogs but it's a delicacy... somewhere. xD
7I thought those were eggs, Arti.
7Oh, but the sharks:
5Hi Arrow!
Haha wow
Ra!
12the only sausages I eat are 100% pork ones
7It was some Norwegian country.
that's nasty :S
Hi Roleplay
he's the creator of the silver falcons :>
5OH.
5OMIGOSH.
12Also, you thought what was eggs..? XD
5o3o
????
^^
7People stick eggs in the ground and eat them months later. o3o
12OMG
12XD
5Really cool plot.
12Well they do it with sharks too XD
Thanks
5^___^
...they do WHAT with sharks?!?
O.o;;
5I endeavour to be more like you two, LOL.
5What about sharks?
12Bury them in the ground for months and then dig them up to cook them when they've rotted XD
ewwwwwww
5Oh yeah.
5Well the one I saw they were hanging the meat up under some open-air roof.
12It doesn't seem THAT gross to me mostly because my steak hangs for a month XD
7http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignQueasine <-- Enjoy.
12.......D:
12SOOOO MESSED UP
/me floofs all over Articuno
cheese is rotted milk
5@Arti :: But it's salted right?
rotted milk, rotted shark, what's the different?
12Yeh and apparently they find it sickening in Japan
5o-o
2eh? 
2what about japan?
7Eggs are baby birds. o3o
12They don't like cheese because it's mouldy milk XD
5Well, my family just gets our steak from the grocery store and stick it in the freezer. xD
when I go to Tanzania, I get to look forward to classes of children asking me why westerners like rotten milk
5LOL, BF.
aaaah
/me runs away from Arrow >_o
2o3o
anyway
5I've made Goat Cheese before. It's gooooooood.
Hi all
because it's tasty.
I think goat cheese tastes funky
and yes goat's cheese is awesome
12I've had sheep's cheese, that was nice
2Goat cheese is kidna brittle, in a way
12Cow cheese for the win
07goat cheese is good o3o
though.
2o3o aye
5Yeah, but it's so fun to make goat cheese from fresh goat's milk.
red leicster
YEAH
/me wonders what human cheese is like.
Hm
12Never tried goat cheese
5Then again, I've also milked a goat xD
12EW OMG......
LOL
5Yup!
Awesome!
5It was at a third-world-country simulation thing though.
12LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
5Sooooooo eye-opening.
Ah, I see
Second Lives or something, RP4L?
8D?
^v^
5It was through Heifer International.
oh
Life's perfect~
ahurr
5They're based on the whole "teach a man to fish, he's fed for a lifetime" principle.
And ah...
2o3o
the third would would get richer if it traded w/ itself
07so they taught the men to fish and the girls to milk goats?
/me runs
2XD
12I saw some horrible scenes from Cape town today of people trying to get work from the world cup..
/me 2throws Kyu somewhere
5I spent a week in "poverty" (no electronics, no watches, no real soap, no air conditioning, IN ARKANSAS) a few summers ago.
2O:
2soapwort?
Articuno, oh?
sounds easy
5It was horrible. xD But I survived and now I never take pretty much anything for granted.
2that's probably not even half of it
5No BF. They put us to hard labour.
/me 7blinks
so who was taught to feed the goats if the girls were only told how to milk them?
/me hides

!define disc
!define disk
-!- phonograph record: sound recording consisting of a disk with a continuous groove; used to reproduce music by rotating while a phonograph needle ...
-!- something with a round shape resembling a flat circular plate; "the moon's disk hung in a cloudless sky"
12Disc is spelt with a C and Disk is spelt with a K
odd o.o
12:D
if i lived closer to you, I'd slap you for that
>:(
12:(
Articuno
07lol
what's the difference?
for now use the trout
between disk and disc?
o3o
afaik, there is no difference
12Read the above? I can't explain it any better than DRF's script Ovo
07I thought disk had a c and disc had a k
/me runs

Hey DRF
=)
03hi
7Meh, it's too distant from usual tastes to go on my list.
03LOL WTF @ this skit
7By usual, I mean my music list is usually filled piano and orchestral arrangements.
urgh what
7Chiptune, not so much.
bye Arrow lol
he never sticks around XD
03still, I hate when people just go to youtube when they want to listen to music
why?
lol
03that's such a waste of bandwidth
03also the quality sucks
03just go get the mp3
03it's easy enough to fond
03*find
5That true DRF.
03half the times the uploaders even put links in the description
Ah, did I now...how do I stop that?
5I usually just go on to look at videos.
03and opening mp3 = less waiting time than streaming :P
03and yeah
i do youtube
if
03YouTube is a *video* site. I watch videos on it
03NOT music
I am at school
<.<
03I hate when there's just album art with music
03that's not a f'ing video!
meh
I find it useful

depends on where you are
03wtf
O_o

welln ours has no blocks on it
whatsoever
well
03because give me one good reason that a school student woudl need to use YT for school related purposes
03:P
on browsers
ports are blocked
certain ones
could depend on your client or internet connection
media studies tards need youtube at school, apparently
and we used it in presentations
O_o
but then again our teachers are odd so

Then I shall destroy them at once
03wtf
03when we did videos for presentations

6di you see the image?
12Yes
2oAo
2yes, but the url's ARE annoying
6oh ok
12But it makes no sense, just a bunch of people complaining that they cant display their art the "old way"
6wel I'm actually not anti-v7 like a lot of people
6it just made me laug
6laugh
07it goes back to the normal url if you click on the title of the pic in the artist description
07o3o
2XD
2yeah but then you can't flip through your messages lol
12So whats the prob..?
07btw Roara
arg..the jungle mission
03DA itself is a problem
6many people are just horrible irked with DA this time
03Like, people who use it
/me runs
6I can't understand why
07do you think you can finish kyuplush by the 22nd? o3o
2... huh
2I just realized that I haven't uploaded anything since BEFORE the switch
2O_o
03sigh, digital TV p¡sses me off sometimes
2not even a journal
6Kyu why?
drf: because it is digital? :P
12Doesnt ANYONE know what DA have done that is SO bad....?
03I hvaen't used my DA since like 2008 :P
6what's the 22nd?
07I wanna have him ride on my head at anthrocon o3o
6lol
6well
03Brother, nah
6I might
03it's because for some reason
03the channel TBS has no sound
6but there's no way I can get out there to give it to you
03so anything I record is silent x.x
03so I'm trying to figure out WHY it is
07well
07i'll go there
03I even have the cable company out here and they determined it's my computer's fault, not theirs >_>
6good luck catching me at home
6because I'm rather busy all this month
2o3o
07o3o;
6and the 22nd might be the time I'm down in LA
07by the 22nd, not ON the 22nd o3o
2OW
2WTH
6yeah but still
2WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ARM!?
everything
6starting tuesday, things get crazy til like....july
12Guess no one knows ovO
Arti: and this bad thing is..?
12A load of people are complaining about DA changing somethig BIG in the way you view images on DA but I don't get what..
12I don't get what they changed
6arti, stuff like how their pages are set up, how the image system works
07Arti
6and the lack of a universal search tool
07o3o
12Well yes but I don't even use DA >v<
03I still think the easiest solution is to not use DA
12So thats why I just want to know what they changed XD
03<Articuno> Well yes but I don't even use DA >v< <-- Indeed :P
12Ok lol
6but again
6I don't mind it like everyone else
03I only ever used it for journals, and now I just use Facebook for everything
03I see no use for DA anymore
03if I want an image, http://images.google.com is a GREAT universal search engine
/me hides
:D
:D
12Soooo
6it would be so nice to see someone I DIDN'T know get my kiribans...
12Whats the prob?
6not people who get it in a constant basis
2Pixen ftw :D
2*PIxiv
2sorry
12WHAT IS THIS OLD WAY IS WHAT IM ASKING LOL XD
12What is the actual problem??
6...-_-
6I JUST told you
well if you arent on the main page you can't search anything
03how is that a problem?
03that's like saying
03if you go to google
03and click on a site
2:la:~~
03that you can't search google anymore
03NO DUH
2that episode was epic
03you have to go back to the search engine
6MOST PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT I DON'T SO I DON'T KNOW WHY
/me 2rewatches
6to restate in clear words
drf: some people just want to search where ever they want
12Yes but whats this "Old Way" of viewing things as you say..?
03to restate in clear words: people are retards
03that answers most questions
though its just an inconvience for me
03:)
03People as a whole are incredibly stupid
03same with people who use, and even more, whine about DA
03:)
"to restate in clear words: people are retards" < this
6Arti
6the old way: allowed you to view images full view without clicking the image, had a search bar on every page, enabled you to go to a new page for each image
6and other things I don't really care about
12Riiiiiight I see
03the full view thing... isn't that just an account setting?
03that can be enabled or disabled?
12I thought it was yeh XD
2... wait there's account settings!?
12What do you mean by go to a new page for each image?
6it was
2O____o
6until v7 came
03well my dad's car has a v8, top that DA
/me hides
/me 2throws V8 Tomato Juice at drf
6arti, now when you click an image thumbnail, it just enlarges, I'm not sure how that whole thing works
03EW
07in about a year they'll be on v20
good night everyone :)
07so there
6it's a new page still, but the urls are wierd
/me runs
03it probably works just like Arti's gallery
2lol
2\
03which I already outsmarted
03within about 20 seconds of looking at it
03shall I do that with DA too?
03to prove a point? :)_
2gah
2my jaw hurts from laughing too much
2xAx
03LOL
at what?
03what were you laugh...yeah
Whenever I have a spare moment I cover myself in woad and screw myself up into a little ball and hang from trees. "I am Prunus Avium amd I will have my vengeance in this life or the next!"
2er
2this and the last episode
2and that was only about 5 minutes total
2so... that just shows you how I am IRL o3o'''''
03no it doesn't
12Anyway it doesnt make much sense to me Roara ^^
03pix or gtfo
/me runs
6and apparently if your image is bigger than the screen resolution, it wont get bigger than your screen, where before it would get bigger and allow you to scroll across the entire image
2lol
12LOL
03wait what?
12Like Facebook then
6arti I never said it would, which is why I wasn't answering you the whole time
what is this song
03well
03Facebook has a set image size
6it still doesn't make sense to me
6I don
03it doesn't go bigger or small
03er
03it's just one size
6*don't care about the stupid drama going on
12Not true DRF
03I just don't care about DA
6I was just laughing at the faces on that comic argh
03orly?
03find me a Facebook image bigger than about 400 pixels
03it's 400xsomething
12Xai viewed one of my images on Facebook and he has a much bigger screen, so it actually loaded bigger :/
03tall pictures willb e taller
03wtf>
12It adjusts with screen res
03no it doesn't
12It did for us!
03as my laptop has a bigger screen res than my desktop
03and the images are smaller
03you're talking about picture galleries, right?
12Yes just any picture uploaded to Facebook
12The picture needs to be big already I thinkj
03http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2704/4/42/558849651/n558849651_1655748_4339663.jpg
03that
03is the actual size
03I don't care what size monitor
03it won't get any bigger
03than that
12Yes
12But
03and the picture was like 4 megapixels...
12If you upload a big picture
03and the picture was like 4 megapixels...
03and the picture was like 4 megapixels...
03and the picture was like 4 megapixels...
12It loads big on big moniters
03and the picture was like 4 megapixels...
12Ok whatever, it did it for my picture
03that's like 3000x2000!!!
03um

2and then it had Japan on the cover with a sword O3o
03and I was gonna record a movie from 6-8

2Hi Roara
12o.o
hey Aurora
6I thought that was a semi truck the whole time
12hai Roara~
03and I'm getting a bunch of random data that doesn't help me solve the problem at all
6turns out there was a firetruck on my street
03LOL
03I'm also kinda mad about "HD"
firetrucks, the new semitrucks of tomorrow! :P
03So I recorded Toy Story off ABC HD last night, right
03*ABC Family HD
03The quality is literally so horrible
03that it would look better off a DVD
03>_>
03and I copied it directly from the cable
03which means that HD is not actually HD most of the time
03which makes me even more mad
So what's everyone doing?
2O:
I'm sitting here boredly
trying to choose an album to listen to but Idk what
03well it has the bigger resolution
03but you'd be better off just using SD and upscaling it >_>

Hai Seran
yeah
03then yes, you can use it

03that's the only requirement
03so yeah, you should be fine
12we can see Venus and Mercury o3o (we think)
03you *will* have to erase it though, just to let you know
ok
12back

how do i do that
03um
03connect the PSP to the computer and copy the files to somewhere, like your desktop>?
oh ok thanks
Wow, what happened to SR's proxy?
It worked fine yesterday, and now it only loads every other page
Hi!
Hmm
/me finds using proxies very unreliable
It's the only way I can get to Spyroforum
Does it work for GPX+ too?
I don't know what happened to it; it was perfect last night
It /did/
It's probably just too far away
It's his IP
ah
you can do that?
Doesn't explain why it worked last night though...
You can use another person's IP?
apparently
I wonder how that works when you're on a completely different computer
I don't know how it was set up, but it works without having to go through my dad's network
a proxy redirects your http through a seperate connection
that way you can gain access to certain blocked content without it showing up on that network
All I've ever used are those web proxies that encode the URL and hide your IP address
I don't trust proxies
03LOL I just misheard this song
your IP can be found somewhere no matter what
03as "Never ever wearing any clothes"
03I don't think that's how it's supposed to go
all it takes is the right person to break it down
But they still had to go through the router here
12o.o
12bad drf o3o
12wait
everything has to go through the router yeah
12I'm NOT! :o
/me shot
03:O!
03PIX OR GTFO
/me runs
yeah, or else it would never got online at all
/me GTFOs
meow :<
03D:
/me has exams this week D:
Well yeah, but this one must not go through my connection at home
oh great my moms like "isnt hacking illegal?" and blah, blah, blah
Or all the blocked sites would still be blocked
And I don't think I'm gonna do well in Spanish... :(
it goes through your router yes
/me has them in a few weeks...
03XD
03tell her it's for homebrew
03that's legal :P
And I wouldn't be able to get on the internet after 10:30 as usual
12but I have one on Tuesday ;3;
but the router is seeing it as a connection to a different source that is hiding SF
lol
i alrdy play ds games on my comp
What do proxies do that makes you not trust them?
because your IP can still be found
aka someone can find out if you're using one
I don't trust anything on the internet
Ah
Well, here I was thinking if I got caught I could just say it doesn't affect my dad because I'm not using this connection
no but he would still see it as a betrayal of trust of sorts lol
Yeah, he would
Back!
12wb~
I don't get it though; if it still shows spyroforum.com in the address bar, and it goes through this router, why doesn't it get blocked?
because the proxy isn't letting your dad's router see the source in a way
I've used proxies before that don't encode the URL and they still get blocked
it's hiding it under a false address
and IP
simply attempting to deceive the router
but a smart network administrator would prolly sense it
so it's like a seperate (but false) network going through the same router essentially?
12O3O;
12good luck...
basically
it's just masking http cod
e
I'm not very familiar with how it works via router protocol
hey
but in essence it's just trying to deceive the router
Hai
All I know is the router will block anything in the address bar that says spyroforum.com
and it's not doing that anymore
helloooooo :D
so is it blocking the site or not?
No
and without the proxy?
without the proxy it does
well your dad just has it word filtered then
Thanks~
I was at my friend's house the last couple days
Oh and my speaking is on wensday
ah
we made a music video
wanna see it?
Actually no
hahahahhaha yes!
and I think the rest of my spanish is thursday
link!
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay I'm not happy
:E
I can google search for "spyroforum" and that doesn't block
12lolz
i had mine last week
thought it was friday
12foreign language is ewww o3o
but it was wed
what about googling "spyroforum.com?"
didnt study
YES
xD
LL you're right
you can't access it though
you can't access the actual url that is spyroforum.com
and yes I know we spelt "unofficial" wrong
However when to the actual site "Wesbsite blocked by netgear firewall"
Hmm, actually, I wonder if it's the fact that it doesn't use port 80 that keeps it from being blocked
That's probably it
yeah, because it lets you on past 10:30
so that makes sense
it's port 808 on SR's IP address
Haha, thanks
He set it up and told me how to configure the settings with firefox
we were watching a bunch of old videos while listening to music and saw that some of it matched up so we made a wholevideo
*whole video
XD
:P
lol
*you're
yes
Hmm, I know my old high school
*school's proxy still
I couldn't really use it for anything, in fact it would be counterproductive because it blocks, but I wonder if I could see if it works through my PC
ugggggh idk what to do :(
bored?
yup
Hahahaha
When I use my school's proxy it blocks my access to everything
XD
03hm
lol
03I'm calling this channel "PPV Thingy"
03That's a fine name
/me runs
03Really I'm just labeling them for future reference
12lol
03and it's the little video that shows you what's on demand or whatever
03the one they just LOOP ENDLESSLY
03it's actually quite mind numbing
/me hides
one more thing drf, im gonna need CFW to run ISO's right?
/me might as well do these MEP parts if there's nothing better to do...><
:P
what one
"Don't you hate it when you die from not passing on chainmail?"
lol
03that's what the pandora battery does
03you install a CFW
k
/me wonders why he has like a bunch of channels in the 100-range when those channels don;'t even exist
great, the show was fun and I got to eat bacon sandwiches for breakfast :D
12XD
03the annoying thing is in order to get the cable company to fix the problem with my cable, I have to tell them I was messing with their cable
Nice
03which is kinda not allowed
12they're phantom channels~
12~whooooo~
03so it's a huge catch 22
/me hides
12and o3o
03but I *know* it's their fault >:|
bacon sandwiches are always nice
03well
03I'm using a thing called TSREader
03THat can basically show you exactly what's going through your cagble
03*cabgle
03*CABLE
mhmm
03each and every channel
the show was so great I was in the very front
03they don't like people doing that LOL
03as you can find stuff they're trying to hide
Haha, just like you wanted
ty..
yup :D
lol
I was able to get video this time too coz security didn't bug me about it :D
Hahaha, cool
03I have like 10 channels that say they're number 101
03that's obviously not true
/me hugs
hey
it was ok
'Sup?
Not much
you?
did you do anything fun?
lol...
the random name appeared as zelda XD
and/or exciting
not really
12o3o
Just winding down after an eventful day.
/me slaps Zelda >:|
yeah, I know what that's like
lol www.explosm.net/comics/628/
good eventful or bad?
Both.
More good, though.
that's good
Just bittersweet. It was a going-away party. :/
ah, like that
that sucks
12lol Bulbasaur XD
I'll get over it.
:)
antenna woo
03LOL, my sisters were arguing over clothing
03ah, gotta love watching girls argue
/me runs
03my mom was like "One of you bought clothes on my credit card" and handed them the receipts
03"But those shoes were only $5, that receipt is for $8.75!"
¦3

But whatever, I can be /le miserable/ if I want.
:(
it'd be better if your were le unmiserable
or however you say it
Inmiserable, maybe.
maybe
Assuming that is a word. :P
lol, only one who speaks French would know
I think heureux is happy in Fench.
*French
Hmm
Well, be that instead of miserable then
:P
I'm trying. It's tough.
:|
Yeah, I know how it feels
I still have two weeks to be heureux.
Why only two weeks?
That's when the heureux ends. :/
why does it end is what he's getting at dude
I know, I like being evasive with answers, I guess.
Basically, it when my best friends leaves for the army for four years.
*friend
gee yay finished a mep part
that sucks
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that
It's okay.
he'll still be able to talk to you online though, right?
He's going to get himself set up for life.
Yeah, luckily, since he's doing a form of ROTC in which he does online college classes.
Ohh, he's gonna be an officer?
Yeah, by the end of it.
Be sure to always salute him from now on then
:P
At first he was going to do school here (on the military's dime) and then serve as an officer, but he hastily signed something.
:P
Ha
I knew a few kids that talked about joining the army
He joined airborne infantry, though, so I have no idea how he'll focus on school while he jumps out of planes.
Oh, really? Did they do it?
but I don't know if any of them actually did it
I haven't talked to them since graduation
a year ago
Ah.
so I dunno

12Pokemon 1?
5xD
5YES.
5LL got it.
5@Brother :: Uh, no, not the irritating pink fluffball.
5THE OTHER ONE.
5o3o
12D:
/me likes both Mew and Mewtwo...
the grey one?
5I think Mew is adorable and all but........
5Mewtwo is freaking awesome.
5<3333333
k
uh
even though I'm still afk anywayy
brb shower XD
/me lols
5xD
12Role
5Yah LL?
12I read somewhere that Mew and Mewtwo were made as such to appeal to different ages+genders
5Orly. O:
12Mew was made for young girls and Mewtwo was made for older boys o3o
5I was like... um... 7 when MSB came out.
12at least, that's what I read
5And I liked Mewtwo because he was DEEP MAN. ;^;
DEEP
that kills people o3o
12wb Guesst
5NUUUUUUU. Myuutsu made teh lab go KABOOOOOOM because he was p-o'ed and realized he'd been created for profit and all that jazz.
Back for the last time today.
/me 5looked too deeply into the movie's plot. xD
5I was 7 okay?! D:
5Cut me a break.
12he's like every other main character
jazz killed no one o3o
12he doesn't die when he's killed o3o
5But it's like... They killed off Latios in "Heroes" and Lucario in "Mystery of Mew" and.. um...
5Has anyone else died in the movies?
Nu
not really
5Mrah.
12L-L-Latios... ;.;
/me cries over its sibling
5Well Lucario was actually a decent character in "Mew and the Wave-Guiding Hero" and then he DIIIIIIIIED. ;;
at least you have Latias
Lucarios: ys
when he found ou his master wasnt a traitor
5Wellyah.
So, its like "NU I DIE NOW? that sucks >>"
5And the Japanese VA for Lucario was superrrrrrb. <3
5Loved it.
12also...
/me can't watch Heroes anymore...
5Why?
12I tear up at the end EVERY TIME ;.;
5That's why they're so great /to/ watch though.
I'v only seen heroes once in my lifetime when I was 8.
I forgot most of it.
12D:
5That's why I watch "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" even though I start bawling at the end every. single. time.
/me 5hides!
/me ties Guesst to a chair with a tv and DVD player in front
12watch >:|
5Because it's SUCH A GREAT MOVIE.
12ad o3o Role

5 7 and 9 = 7 /of/ 9?

I really loved 7 when I was 10. Not as much as 2, though.
5@Brother :: Uh, YES.
5And it's not just any guy.
5><
But 7 had all this mesmurizing tech in it.
And that's why I'm a technical person today. :p
Yep
/me fell asleep during that one o3o
Sorry for not making that clear
5Movie: "...I have been.. and always shall be.. your friend. Live long.. and prosper." Me: "BAWWWWWWW. ;____;"
5I liked the movie with Deoxys. ...But I think Deoxys is great. xD
/me shivers, thinking of the scene in Heroes of Latios flying above Earth...
5Deoxys in the manga = EPIC WIN.
I haven't had the time to brush up on my Trekkie skills. Give me a month in summer and I'll come back to you.
12and I had a dream some time after about it...
Never read the manga
5xD Okay, Guesst.

12Ahaha
14So I'll soon have a mp3 collection of the Pokemon Stadium soundtrack :D
12The wildlife experts say "Doesn't make any sense"
12Which it doesn't
14Of course it doesn't make any sense
14A fox doesn't just attack something for the fun of it
12Thats not the main thing
14-something +human
12Firstly..
wanna see a fail?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58FcsLm2rjk
^ 'Destroyed'.
Nice wording.
12Why did they leave the door open at that time of night..?
03A fox attacked a baby?
03Jeez, what was Xai doing last night?!
/me runs
12It must have been open for a while if they claimed a fox got in!
O.o
14attacked 2 9-month old babies @drf
/me pokes Espeon :)
03same diff
03I was more after the Xai joke
/me runs
14lol
12The only explanation for something like that is either a REALLY odd fox or a rabid one Ovo
14Or a robot
/me shot
6my guess was rabid
12Nope
14Doesn't sound logical/believable to me so
121. They would have mentioned that, 2. Rabies is practically extinct in the UK
Or one that some people had hand-fed so it got comfortable with humans?
12It's very very very very rare
12Well I've never heard of it!
12All you need to do is clap your hands and they flee
14^
Babies are different though?
12Yes, but still
14Fox's generally run from humans anyway
14No matter the size ovo
12It's just dodgy
6um...
6did obsi just approve peas without reading/
6someone went in and put random stuff not even from chat
12Dunno why?
12How long ago?
12Because I know he did one by accident
6there's like 5
6all from the most recent update
He said he couldn't access the peas. o.o
http://www.lugia.us/Peas/?627

I was just wondering about something
14will do

14Just shut it down then?
not yet
6what
6you know what I was wondering?
6who are you o-o
6ok I figured that, but I can never be sure
6:)
Yeah, I've just had to come to terms with an annoying characteristic that... well, I like temporary form changes. My name changes sometimes as well
because it's awfully specific
6ok
6so what were you wondering about?
Well
You know Brother?
6ugh
6yes
Why does he constantly ... go on about you ovO; It's sort of creepy
6^nothing new

Does he talk to you a lot though? lol *sigh*
6it really bugs me, but what can I do about a stalker LMAO

or
Espeon, do you know anything about slip cast?
'yay Aurora <3'
do you think i have a chance on her etc
I should get to meet her in Cali etc etc..
12You know what my solution was to Brother?
12No more PMs
14Brother is just plain weird
I'm sort of... 'uh, man she doesn't LIKE you'
12Now I think he's awesome
LOL
14LOL Arti
12He talks and joins in normally on main chat and he's good company

I like Aurora too, but yes :>
can you imagine what size they were in the clouds?
6it's flattery for some, ugh from others
14Roara ish awesome

What are the forums you use?
/me reads
:D
12SMF, why?
6....WTF THAT POST LMAO
07looooool
12SHE'S A FRIGGIN CELEBRITY THAT IS ALREADY TAKEN
6as much as I can't get along with him AT ALL
6his posts are 100% LOL
12..
12It kinda makes me mad
12He treats that bloody woman as if she's an object
Just wondering Articuno
6well yeah
oh god he never stops going on about her
I have an issue with spambots
12"She WILL be my wife, I will MAKE her my wife"
6it's funny that he's dragged this out for so long
how do you keep them away from your forum Oo
/me changes topic to 'BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!'
12"She IS my future wife, no matter that she loves someone else."
he's delusional
12Anyway
/me runs
12I don't approve spam bots that try to register, simple
14XD
12Make your forum approval only
12brb
6brb
Okies
Articuno is a spambot
But they mess with your stats
that's kind of urgh
And about Amanda or whatever
O__o
6he's in love with a "Survivor" celebrity
6who's already in love with someone else
6he claims he knows her and has contact with her
6and at first I thought it was a joke, but he's dead serious and has been for over a year now
12<Andrew> Articuno is a spambot <-- LOL
^^
That sounds kinda ... stalkerish
And LOL
Articuno does spam sometimes...
Andrew, catch!
6sounds kinda....Brother-ly
/me 6RUNS
14LOL
!apple
/me throws 2 tumbleweeds at Andrew!
03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW MACBOOKS
12Aurora, by contact he means he's emailed her and she's never replied, and he has her on Myspace LOOOL
Wut
12He said that to me!
6AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
6wait
6LOL
6He told you that XD
12Yes
/me drops the tumbleweeds because he can't catch
12I was basically having a go at him for being so selfish and not thinking about what SHE wants
gah - know how hard it is to type with a cat on your lap?
12He just automatically thinks she WILL love him back or she MUST.
He's all 'DON'T INVOLVE ME IN THIS' if he started a discussion.
6my laptop is literal
I noticed a few times...
12Anyway
XD
12Don't be mean now
Ahhh. And n I won't do anything I just noticed he's like that quite often.
6he's pretty harsh to people with no warning
<Articuno> He just automatically thinks she WILL love him back or she MUST. <- tbh that's fished up.
Really?
6it's freaking annoying, especially since I've been in the girl's position a number of times
12It's everywhere Im sure
Hai~
12Because Tier used to be that way with me
12and when I told him I loved Xai, all of a sudden it was OMG RAAAAGE
12Rage against Xai!!!!
hi
6yeah
Tier bugs me.
haha
12I never EVER said I wanted to be with him, no matter how much he claims I WAS his girlfriend XD and that I promised him my love
raaaage
Ugh lol
12This is what annoys me about some guys, they treat you like property
12"SHE'S MINE" when I'm obviously not..
To be honest I never really... how could he get away with that?!
I don't ever see you sort of like... saying that, esp not with how things were :/ dumb people lol
6I really hate that line "she's mine"
Ew
12Only his retard friends believed him :3
12Obviously most of TST back then knew the full story
now she's asleep halfway on my arm...
12Aww
Hmm? ^^

without taking the side of anyone: What's so terrible about bp anyways? The risk about deep-sea oil derricks was well-known. Such an accident had to happen oneday
I have nothing against them, I actualy rather liked them, but yes, they are letting me down >>
12Back!
12I has dinners
07prove it
enjoy!
and he Arti, whatcha eating so I can see if I want to steal some or not XD
*hey
I am seriously making a lot of typos today...
at least it hides my bad spelling XD
12Well once again since I'm on my own.. only chicken burgers.. chips and fried eggs..
07fried egg for dinner? o3o
of course - because they first tried to fix the valve, then put something over it to stop it. I think they were just running through a checklist on what to do first and what next
Ah... so not special enough to steal...
12Egg and chips is dinner to the British!!
/me throws some seagull deterant over the chips
14^
12Mean
12We Brits are poor remember?! XD
/me runs
From here?
12Thats why Yorkshire Puddings were invented! XD
lol! XD
yorkshire puddings rule
12OMG I KNOW
12I looooooove them! <33333
:D
You say that Arti, but you have REAL butter on that burger ;p
She/He should be able to connect
/me hides
12OH YEH XD
12REAL butter is for winnars
sure, you could have done things better - if you had known how what try works out. But due to the fact nothing they tried was ever attempted before, they had to find out the hard way
6BUTTER WHO SAID BUTTER
12I try not to think about the oil spill at all
12It makes me SO sad
12and I did
12Butter for the win!
12Infact
12Why do I not have any butter on these chips heheh XD
>>
i love the fact BP was broadcasting it on a webcam the whole time
/me pokes that fat bird
12^v^
07fatbuuuuurd
6I luuuuuuuuuurve butter
12lol
12Fatfeeeeesh
Well, I must say, BP are doing their best to clean it up and never tried to get out of it
just for that they are good in my books
Hm
I'm a n00b but
difference between real and fake butter being?
/me just read what Yorkshire pudding is
btw pro tip, a bacon sandwich with butter doesn't taste nice
12I love how stupid people are blaming Obama for the oil disaster
07one is milkfat, the other is vegetable oil
12Andrew, bacon toastie with butter does though
hrm - sounds like a hefty version of our pancakes^^
:D
No
UE**
Oh xD
Horrible troll
12You don't bake/roast pancakes though do you..?
Meow

12It's embarassing on the phone to customers
ooooooh
12I was commended for having a posh way of speaking when I started my job.. so much for that XD
but if you say you bake it - sounds like a flatbread I got at the libanesian place
12Pancakes are fried!
anyone ever ate libanesian?
12No
you should. Tastes WONDERFUL. An explosion of taste
03:3

03so like
6I can't even read it...
03I need to call the cable company and whine about them breaking my cable
03http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7707/cableproblem.png <-- can any of you figure out what the problem is from that?
12I can't read the middle word
03as I dunno if they will either XD
12I hate imageshack
12It never loads
03it works fine for me
It's blank?
/me is tailchewed :o
07isn't loading
12See DRF?
12XD
12The connection was reset

12The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.

12* The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
12moments.
12* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
12connection.
12* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
12that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
12hahahaha
03use ietab
03o.o
07O3O
03that works for me sometimes
12I'll have to go get it
o.o
03switching rendering engines from Firefox to IE and back
03will randomly make it load
03XD
12I'll just get chrome out actually
03XD
03I'll just upload it somewhere else
03>_>
12It probably loads faster than a tab in Firefox does ;D
12Still not loading
I got the same problem with Opera, Chrome and Firefox recently
ietab is like giving firefox aids
Imageshack is just...slow. DAMN slow
12.......XD
12Truth be told these days I friggin hate Firefox :/
03http://i50.tinypic.com/27xqgd1.png
03I hate the layout
03Firefox 2 was amazing
033 came out and I was like WTF is this crap
12I would use Chrome if it wasn't for everything they missed out in it
03heh
03I just had to install like 20 addons
03to make Firefox 3 not gay
12LOL!!!
what did they miss arti?
12WHY DIDNT YOU JUST USE 2?
03I did
03for a long time
12I thought I told you?'
03but then stupid sites like YouTube
03FORCE you to upgrade
12Image properties
ohh
that
03they literally refuse service on FF2
12Certain java script won't run on it
is a pain
03outdated my a**
03Firefox 2 is fine XD
12I see
and not allowed at our work due to massive vulnerabilities
waking up to the sound of your dog yarping in the hall is not fun
12Cool the radio just switched over XD
12To Arti Mix
03meh security
03I really don't see what was so unsecure about it
12My batch file is awesome now
03the only reason FF3 is safer is because it's newer
No it's not
03that'll get hacked in due time
12DRF, we've had this discussion before
03I'm not the one that brought it u
03p
03anyway, did you see my picture?
so, you admit it's more secure.
12No because it never loaded
the only way to not get hacked is to not use the internet
:P
12Yeh :/
03<Andrew> the only way to not get hacked is to not use the internet <-- THIS
honestly drf: I won't start this discussion again. You're just as stubborn as an elephant, but lack its elegance
03or just to not be a retard
12Any NEW thing that comes out has to target SOMEONE before it gets blocked
03I don't go to like www.thisisnotavirus.com
03I haven't gotten viruses in like a year
03using "insecure" browsers
12LOL AT THAT SITE
even if I'd point into the blue sky and tell you this was blue, you'd persist in telling me it was liac
It is, you're just no fun
12Lol no viruses in a year!
03LOL is that a real site?
03I just amde it up
12yes it is
03and I'm not about to click it
12Click it, it's awesome
03LOL
12It's safe
03no thanks :P
::P
12Fine
12If it wasn't, I'd have kicked you for linking it
03LOL at that
03that hurts my eyes
drf not getting virii doesn't mean the browser is secure
12LOL VIRII
03I know
03but it means it's safe enough for my use >_>
03anyway
12You just never hear that word XD
03http://i50.tinypic.com/27xqgd1.png
03that should load
12OMG
03TBS HD is the channel that has a problem
03and on my comptuer, there's no sound
03the cable company came out
03and said it was my comptuer that's broken
12Yeh it loaded but I just looked at it and blanked out thinking I'd clicked a random link somewhere
03which of course isn't true >_>
03I just need to explain to them what that picture shows LOL
03chances are they won't care :/
03and I honestly wish there was something other than Windows Media Center that I could record TV shows to, but sadly that's how CableCards work...
03anyway, do you see the difference between the one I arrowed to and the others? LOL
a quote from slashdot to you drf: "Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.12, mere hours old, is vulnerable by default to a directory traversal trick, via the view-source mechanism. Although mitigated by the NoScript plug-in, this is quite a serious bug — the default installation is vulnerable from the get-go."
03I used 2.0.0.20
03but now I have 3.6 so whatever
you remind me of a turk in a turkish joke^^
delicious
12LOOOOL
12How?
A guy goes to a disco, wearing a shirt with "Turks have 3 major problems" written on it. He stands at a bar and a turk asks: "Ey yo fu*** whata we have problems?"
The guy responds: "Problem 1: You're WAY to nosy and unfriendly."
Later on he walks to the toilet, two turks get to him. "Ey, whatya have with problems, he?" they ask, pushimg him around.
"Well, Problem 2: You're all way too agressive" - the turks are thrown out of the disco.
:D
Nyte!
aha! it lives!
Two hours later - in front of the disco. The guy gets out, five turks are waiting there, holding knives in their hands. "Tell us whatwe got for problems, you piece o...."
"Problem 3: Turks take knives and go to a shoot-out"
haha
12XD
03that reminds me of something
03I was at a scouting convention, right
03and met this guy from Detroit
12You know I haven't heard many English, Irish and Scotsman jokes in aaaages
03he asked where I was from
03I told him
03he was like "People from Troy always think they're better than everyone else >_>"
03I was like "I don't think, I KNOW"
/me runs
^_^
12LOOOOL
12Well if you live in the wealthier part of a ghetto, you have every right :D
03LOL
03Troy isn't a ghetto, but it's like the rich city surrounded BY a ghetto XD
03Detroit is like meh
6rararararra
12Thats what I meant, Detroid DRF :>
03yeah
03XD
03brb food
12By the way
12Who else thought Gale of Darkness sucked?!
6me
oh, that's a nasty joke^^
6it had serious potential, no arguments
12Do you also think Colosseum was awesome..? Because I do :>
6but it lacked in following through
6colosseum was epic
12I think my problem is it was just so stupidly ridiculously unrealistically hard
6I had to go buy it again after I decided GoD wasn't enough
14Gonna play some GH
12yeh colosseum is win.. GoD made me angry
6arti, GoD was hard?
6or Colosseum?
12GoD
6yeah
12You know..
12The part with the birds..?
6it wans't TOO hard
6...
12That is just SO STUPID
a western politican comes to china, interested in how everything's going on there....after three days he finally asks an english-speaking chinese: "do you have elections in China?" The man looks asking, but then responds: "yes, sil, evely molning."
6yes that
6that whole island had me raging
12I worked so friggin hard to get that far because it takes friggin AGES of endless battles
12Yeh :/
12and then..
12you get to the bird bit
6I ran out of pokeballs
12and I SWEAR I gave up RIGHT THER
12E
6well
6not really ran out
12I was just like FFS I'm not playing anymore
6but I looked at what I had left and said "screw it"
12..I hadn't
6at that point I wasn't going to be able to, so I just saved it for the final battle
12I missed so damn many of them
6I didn't care
12and so many of my Pokemon fainted often.. and I NEVER let Pokemon faint usually
12I got through almost all of Platinum (or was it Diamond) without a single Pokemon fainting once and NO items in battle, right up until the last league battle.
12Then I lost one Pokemon
12Lol my canary is asleep
12Even though I have the light on and am playing music
12He's a sphere XD
Took me a second to get it
6LOLSPHERE
same here - though I'm not a native english speaker^^
12XDDD
I am, but I'm not. :D
Spanish was the first language I learned... but I forgot it because I spoke English so often
6I didn't get it for a while
So I have this weird accent that nobody recognizes.
XD
12I think I know this one but carry on XD
The english guy is led outside, the rifles are lifted and pointed at him. Then he yells "EARTHQUAKE!". Everybody except for him drops to the ground or runs for their lifes. He escapes
12Yeh I remember
12I actually think this is one of those English, Irish and Scotsman jokes here :3
XD
Oh noes
6...lmao
But there really was a fire and everyone died.
12LOOOOL
12I think that response is funnier than the joke
07XD
03back
Wibbles!
I dun get it
Still don't get it
will someone from england not fallen off the chair please explain?^^
!define scottish
-!- the dialect of English used in Scotland
!define scotland
-!- one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; located on the northern part of the island of ...
03I don't o.o
03racist
12Add the numbers up
/me hides
12LOL
03what do you mean add them up?
036+12+32?
12No just the first two, then figure out how to get 32 from that XD
03by multiplying by two?
12:3
03I still don't get it
12you know, it's hard to explain if you don't get it, if I try to say it I don't think it sounds funny
So... it's two per Englishman or... something?
one guy once ask what the difference between England, Scotland and Ireland was. He received this explanation:
If you're invited for tea in england and ask for more sugar, the housewife searches and gives you a special small piece of sugar.
In ireland you're given the entire sugar pot and requested to server yourself.
If you tell the housewife in scotland your tea required more sugar, you'd be said: "Are you sure you stirred already?"
12Rofl XD ok....
03I just don't drink tea, problem solved :D
I don't get that one either. XP
but we don't have root bear over here :P
6root beer is awesome
03you have other sodas though
03like Sprite, right?
6but only certain brands
yeah, but it tastes different here
6Mug <3
and we have !Fanta! here
Cherry Pepsi ftw
12Is A&W the best root beer?
never seen Cherry Pepsi here
D:
nor any Crystal coke, Crystal Pepsi or other crazy things
12"I would like to know who makes these stupid jokes about Scotsmen, published in the newspaper," says a Scotsman to his friend.
12"Let's call the newspaper and find out!"
12"All right, but who's going to pay for the phone call?"
12:D
*ggg*
I'm pretty sure they discontinued Crystal Coke... in the '80's...
12Xai's father is a great example of a tight Northerner
a scotsman is asked to the doctor. The doctor asks for an urine sample. The result is expected one week later
12He missed out on an extra £30,000 in house value because he didnt want to pay £200 to correct a beam
12Instead he just cut the house size by six foot XD
One week later the scotsman walks to the doctor. "You're perfectly healthy." the doctor says
/me throws a friendlymushroom at Roara
The scotsman goes home and says: "Fantastic, Sharon, neither me, you, our two children, grandpa nor uncle mac have ANY disease!"
12HAHAHAHA
12By the way, what I said about Xai's father isn't even a joke
6friendly mushroom wut
1-up
"Damn" a scotsman gasps. "I missed my bus and had to run here all the way! DAMN!" "Be happy - you saved 50 pence!" "NO WAY! If I had run behind a cab, I would have saved FIVE POUNDS!"
07you remember
07o3o
12loooool
You and your British humor.

12What do you call six weeks of rain in Scotland?
12Summer!
12I think that one can count for all of Britain ¬¬
03LIOL
03-I

12Did ye hear about the Scotsman who married a girl born on February the 29th so he'd only have to buy her a birthday present every four years?
12Hahaha
XDS
-s
12It's funny but the only Scotsman on TST is actually one of the most generous peopple I've met.
regarding the weather: When I was to tunisia, the guide told me: "We have very few rain. Our rain season is from December to January - whilst the rain season in europe is from January to December"

How fail must your teacher be to have a discussion about the length of P. Diddy's name?
7Meh, he's all right. A bit quirky in the sense that he likes to bring everything to Michael Jackson and The Odyssey. o3o
2as fail as my history teacher 8D
I mean... at least the "lowest" my English teachers have stooped was my Grade 12 teacher managing to read everything as either extremely raunchy or completely vulgar.
"Wait... Hamlet said /what/!?"
7In Chemistry, we ended on a discussion about being secure from door-to-door scammers.
My Linear Algebra I lecturer went off on a tanget about RSA for a (hour-long) lecture. :P

I have that song on my mp3 player
/me Laaaas, still clawing
I play it loudly in busy parking lots with my windows rolled down

Hahaha
I have it on my MP3 Player, but I've never blasted it anywhere

:o
lol
/me looks up to Ari
:o
/me gets popcorn
:3
12Pweeeeeeeease? owo
:o
lol
Give her what she wants~
/me shot
/me squeaks as she falls to the ground
poor innocent Infamous
im use to it
The video or Justin Bieber?
both
XD
/me moans happily, eager to be pleased~
"You looked like you got [censored]ed up the ass by a 13 year old boy" "HOORAY FOR BUTTSEX!"
/me smiles
exactly why i said that
hmm...
/me trills loudly as she is filled, rubbing all over Ari's body as thanks
:o
/me starts thrusting inside her, pressing his body against her tightly as he thrusts
/me faps to this
/me shot
/me lets out a long moan, massaging Ari with both her claws and her Psychic~
/me also rubs Chime with Psychic ;3
/me :O
/me is being rubbed with a psychic pussy and mrrs
If I had Justin Bieber's kind of money, I'd be all like, baby baby baby OHHHHHH too
/me sucks on Ari's tongue, wrapping her own around it, letting out happy sighs at each thrust from Ari~
I still wouldn't
XD
So how is everyone today?
/me ish so-so
12yous? o3o
And then like baby baby baby YESSSSSSSSS
Not "baby baby baby noooo"
/me humps into the psychic force holding his member. Because of the pleasure LL's getting, the force deminishes slightly, but atill has enouh of it there for him to thrust into~
Eh
Could have been better
That would be horrifying
I sure hope not
D:
/me rawrs
Yeah it owuld
owo *would
nooo baby baby baby....
I'm still wishing that Bin Laden would make a channel on this network so I can turn him into the FBI
12im no dog
and become best friends
We're not having roommates dude
I mean our ex-roommates
Single rooms
Oh yeah
Matt and Carissa
03LOL
:P
What are you, then?
Because the school won't allow it lol
03but playing fetch with dragons is fun!
/me runs
That's stupid :(
Because we go to a Catholic school
XD
oh
/me Laaas, deeply blushing, then uses her Psychic powers to intensify the nerves in Ari's member, multiplying his pleasure to unbelievable amounts ^w^
All the more reason to be roommates
fiile a complaint against segragation
sorry, forgot for a sec
night all
Hahaha
03LOL @ these caption borks
I don't think even secular schools would allow that
12night Slash~
12and o3o
03"0'x" <-- looks like a face
03but it actually shows that
nah me neither
We're actually both Catholic by the way :P
but it makes the rule make even more sense
/me faps.
Your Catholic school is probably more secular than my college
03for some reason before and after commercials, the captions become random jibberish >_>
03and in red o.o
Probably
/me sees this going on and drools, also faping
030'x
Haha
03er
And I go to a community college
I bet it is
mine is just a dummy community college
Which has to legally be secular
03040'x
it really isn't that religious at all
/me runs
/me will soon climax into the psychic thing surroundin his rod |3
its college.. id figure not
Our school's only really religious with the one theology class we all have to take
03brb
after that it's like any other college
]BTW I have a question that's been bothering me ever since I came here. What's with "BLERUERHGUEHGH" buisness?
i went to a private catholic highschool and it was pretty religeos
All the teachers are supposed to lead the class in prayer before starting
12ask someone who matters o3o
*religous
/me hides
Hahahaah
But barely any of them do
Well you matter
None of mine did
12shrug
None
I think I had a total of 2 last year that did it
eh... we never did
Nah, Shanahan did
12beats me
Oh right
*One of mine did
One
/me cums into the psychic pussy |3~
One, none, what's the difference?
Haha
the difference is one
/me doesn't completely fail at math
:P
I wish my school was more secular :(
Lotta pleasure XD
i wish my school had more chicks in it...
anyone know?
!define BLERUERHGUEHGH

thank you witchcraft
O_O
Yeah, my mom heard someone say her daughter got into witchcraft at Winona State
wican is just a religion that worships nature doesnt it
And she strongly discouraged me from going there
/me squeals, letting it all wash over her, but raising an arm to shield her eyes
03back
SR made fun of that for weeks
I actually don't mind Wiccan as much as other religions
I am NOT a performer
/me tries not to get into his anti-religion rant
/me smirks
I've probably heard most of it before
I decided not to go to the same school after spending a week programming robots there and not liking it for the dorms, CS program, and food
Stuff like that doesn't bother me
/me then SCREAMS as she orgasms, shooting her's and Ari's mixed fluids out full feet from her body, happily purring afterward <3
12wb
:3
I don't like ranting about it because it usually does bother people
:3
My turn?
Either that or I'm preaching to the choir
/me hides |3
ironic statement there
:P
Yay, you noticed :D
/me pants, cleans herself, takes a deep breath, then nods at Chime "If its ok with Ari b/c he just finished o3o"
I just think, it doesn't affect me if others are atheist
I feel the same way
Is it, Ari?
/me nods
it's just like another religion the way I look at it
/me blushes deeprly
But my turn again afterwards ^^
As long as they don't try to force me to believe what they believe and aren't super-rude about it, I'm fine with them stating their beliefs
12*deeply
12o3o
12nu
Or I might surprise join in
and I couldn't care less if somebody doesn't share my religion
12just once each toni-ok
12if you and him go at it at the same time, thats ok
12if not, you're done, Ari o3o
kk
Now when people start making assumptions about my intelligence because I happen to have a religion, then I don't like it as much
i dont mind people stating their beleifs its just when they start putting down other people thinking that their religion is responsible for war and all that crap i get a bit irritated
I haven't come across that O.o
and dam family guy is so distracting..
/me spreads for Chime and waits :3
:O
03Ari on Chime or Chime on Ari action now :3
Ohhh, true
/me hides
he does do that
Indirectly hints at religious people being primitive all the time
No X3
Religion doesn't cause war, people cause war :3
12lolz
It's like
not to us as much because we rarely state our religion
12]why not? :o
03EX oN
politics cause war
My butt is sore today
that too
So :<
Well yeah, but he talks about theists in general
true
03Well you on Ari :3
Religion does help sometimes
/me runs
03...LOLWT!
03*WTF
I'm good :3
XD
03This commercial
Like he's inherently superior because he doesn't believe in God
despite the fact that he was the only atheist in that class
Mebbie :P
03"Want silky, luminous skin?"
03NO I DO NOT WANT MY SKIN TO GLOW IN THE DARK
12lol
not sure about Brian actually...
/me bends down to lick LL's sex~
I'm pretty sure he's atheist
/me squeaks
/me is an atheist \o/
12lolwut
o3o Snow
/me installs C&C, Red Alert, Red Alert 2, Red Alert 3, Tiberian Sun, C&C 3, and C&C 3: Kane's Wrath on his laptop
12yo momma so dumb she kept saying "am not" to R2
/me hides
And if anyone wants me to describe why atheism is more than likely correct, I can oblige :D
03what?
if religion is ever an ingrediant in war it is use to unite the people and make commonality to bond the people you need to each other
Red Alert 3, bah
lol bobafet chicken
/me brings his toung in and licks her walls~
12R2D2
03oh
/me likes it pretty good :3
Bobafet reminds me of Wobbuffet
lol yeah
Hahaha
12lol Glacy
/me doesn't think religion is much of a factor these days in war
drf: thats too late
Which is a good thing :D
we already put radiation on you :P
12she thought JarJar came with PicklesPickles? o3o
/me hides
/me is sooooooo glad countries don't go to war anymore because of religion
:D
:D
except in the war between different middle eastern countries
it is on the arab terrorist front because it unites the people and highlights the enemy
*wars
/me moans loudly, already wet from before, but not increasingly so~
12*now
Sunnis vs. Shiites
Oh, right
Well, I'm glad it's less often
but its also political
and Muslims vs. Jews
:P
12lol
XD
And SR really needs to stop joining and quitting, haha
lol I've been sitting in Charizard ever since I joined and we use it like...never lol
/me sucks on LL's lower regions ;3
/me drools
mine just shows up blue if anyone joins or quits and black if someone talks
I barely ever see anyone on Charizard in whois
you don't have super mod powers though Infamous
yeah I know lol
which is pretty much never
/me squeals, widening herself to allow more tongue~

Sneasal

12if you want to, then do so? *squeal*
No, I'm suggesting names for the server

Exactly. Good night
03xxx3

Awesome.
Haha
XD
Ohh wow
/me doesn't care about capabilities, just cares about stability
I'm guessing SR is going to be naming it then
yes yes
I would ditch everything and live in this channel XD
XD
D:
A $5/mo VPS that can be connected for months without splitting is soooooo much better than a $300+/mo server that splits every week

thats like:4
12 am, and I have school at 9 XD
03school at 9?!
03My high school always started at 7:30
well I'm actually lying
lolhere starts at7am
06high shcool started at 7:30 for us, but that was if you took zero period
*at 7am
by school its like a 3 week program I was accepted into
03ah
06standard starting time was 8:50
.....LOL 0 period?
06yeah zero
03yeah, I have a summer class on the 28th
06it wasn't required
03Fail
03we didn't have homeroom either
06see
zero period=make-up
03just 6 periods, with lunch in the middle
03and I just realized how wrong that sounded
/me runs
06you could take zero period, but get out of 3rd or 6th
lol
I'd get out of my 6th but thankfulyl that ones over
03I always called them like "first hour", "second hour"
03the thing is, they weren't actually an hour
06our school ran on 3 periods a day, 100 minutes each
sounds like my chorus teacher
03but like 55 minutes XD
now if only School didnt start on August 9th >>
03then move to Michigan
03there's a state law here
"you can have the rest of your periods now" o3o;
06so if you took that morning class, you could leave after lunch, over an hour before everyone else
03that public schools can't start until after Labor Day
03thanks to tourism
drf: I woukd
06...tourism lmao
03yeah

04I stumbled across it while listening to KH music
We were talking about the 'other method' of getting Darkrai
i'm too cheap to do that

07yes.
Any i have to go, it was fun battling against you two. Seeya
07you have to translate.
see ya
vouze ne parlez rien francais
2first of all, not entirely sure who's thinking it, but it says "If [he/she] knew my feelings..." "How would they react..."
2so....
ah dam
2jsut for the record
What does that mean?
you never speak frech
2the pronoun used for "I" is "boku"
nope
2which is male
2o3o usually
it was a command
lol
oh
lol
Well then
Never speak Spanish
unless you want to
aye!
well thats 3 down for me
and one rude smack to the face
Hm?
3 whats?
in the tournament
Oh yeah
3 wins
yeah
lol I'm happy
I actually won one
:P
if it weren't for his gliscor basically outspeeding everything i might have had a chance against it
2... wait I forgot the original quesiton
/me 2headbashes
Hahaha
04lol
yeah, it was a bit unfortunate that your entire time was taken down by it
never even got to see the rest
yeah i know
I didn't know what to do against his gliscor either
I wasn't able to kill it, I know that
and he had his gliscor's moveset perfect against mine
everything was super effective against me
that sucks
2er
only my power ranger got a hit on him
then he killed it by its only weakness by fire fang
Was it faster than his or did he just not kill it right away?
bullet punch is a priority move
apperently sucker punch has priority over it too
2... 
/me 2whoops and does handsprings across the floor
2YESSSSSSSS
its a move that goes first always
Ah
I like moves like that...
except when the other guy uses it
:P
2I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW
with scizor, it is its signiture move basically
cause it get technician boost as well as type boost
Ah yeah
and with its machamp llike attack it is awesome
ugh, 2:15
3 15 here
/me needs to get sleep these next few days
Haha, that's even worse
http://www.tested.com/news/how-to-enable-motion-interpolation-on-your-movie-files/329/ this is sweet.
I'll be starting work this week
have you checked on your job yet?
o hok
yeah
what days?
orientation is wednesday
ah
they actually didn't know
must be really unorganized or I was talking to the wrong person or something
lol
typical
but they said I'd get shown my schedule after orientation
I just hope I have weekends off
friday and saturday night would be ideal
04why?
had to deal with them waxing the floor the other day
2oh
they were getting in the way?
2the author of one of my favorite fics gave me permission to do a comic of it
2|:3
yeah but theres nothing you or they can really do about it
they close off an area so they can wax
yeah
hm
04lol
at least it wasnt a busy night like the other night...
haha
i hate it when they close off an aile and we have to blitz it
2C: it makes me happy
the one here is never busy when I'm there at night
ah well.. then you may have a good job then
but the few people who are there always seem to be teenagers
might ask if you can wear your mp3 player
I plan to
2OW
2LEG
2OOOOOOOOW
actually first I need an MP3 player
just ask the night management and not the people in personnel
*shot*
lol
2WTF
in days i dont think they can have the stuff but night shift seems to be alright with it
but the thing that is gonna suck is when the teenagers that come in at night figure out that I'm easy to pick on
yeah I would think it'd be alright
the night people seem to be pretty relaxed here
because they're zombies
yeah
lol
or vampires as someone put it
Hahaha
zombies was my word and annother associate put it as vampires...
i wonder if she likes twilight..
I wouldn't be sursprised
:P
I don't really see the night shift people as vampires
04lol
except the not being out in the sunlight thing
2GAAAAAH
2MY CHARACTERS ARE TAKING REVENGE ON ME
i find it discourageing in this town that most if not all teh friendly girls here are engaged or married...
but vampires don't act like they're half asleep like night shifters do
04lol
/me 2falls over
2THIS ACTUALLY HURTS
shes pretty peppy though
yeah, small towns are like that
is she engaged/married?
04ba dum tsch
married now
Ah
when i met her she was engaged
07o3o
had annother one on my first semester of college
i was flirting with her and after a few weeks she told me her fiance said that he saw me in one of his classes and i was like.... aw...
Oh...
that hurts
2... huh
yeah but its to be expected
my luck
people get engaged young by you it seems
2whaddaya know, I actually managed to get the pic the way I'd originally wanted it
most people here don't marry until they're 30 or so
as well the major im in doesnt excactly attract girls either
04lol
Criminal justice?
most of them marry around 20s here
I would think ti would
yeah
2Lyon: http://j.imagehost.org/0616/4_30.png
no its a male dominated feild
04oooh
oh yeah, there aren't many girls in it
04it looks all dramatic in monoshrome or w/e
I thought you meant girls don't like guys who are in it
04monochrome*
and if you do get a girl, shes like 50 and had 10 kids my age
lol
07o3o
2XD
04lol
2there's like
Haha
2four different files of the same image though lol
Yeah, I can't say I know many girls trying to become cops
ah well
well.. it doesnt have to be an officer in that major
Your day will come
technically i dont need the degree to become a cop
but it helps
yeah
a degree always helps
lol adult swim just had a thing on pokemon
04just do it
Haha, what was it?
2XD
oh just a quick commentary about some people hating it some not caring for it another preferring iphone games and fuck digimon
XD
"fuck digimon"
saw it at the corner of my eye
yeah
crossed out
I actually got into digimon for a while
not for long though
i liked one the the animeted series on abc a long time ago
back when I was around 9
me too
i never really knew the concept of it though
I think I did once
but I don't know
*now

/me belly-rubs Espeon
/me eeps and purrs, not able to do anything but purr as his belly is rubbed <v<
it was freaking awesome
14^^
/me rubs more
More of you were there too but I don't remember what you did
Hmm.
Interesting.
/me coils tail around the rubbing hand, kicking his hindlegs. Doesn't get much better than this :3
/me rubs more firmly :3
Haha, that's a strange thought. XD
:D
I wish I could video record this [censored] hahaahh
/me squeezes slightly with tail, getting all nice and fuzzy belly fur
/me continues rubbing, seeing that the Espeon is clearing enjoying it
Who knows, maybe in the future? :P
oh dear ahaaahahahah
I have some weird ass dreams, after that one I was somehow selected to go and get these old boxes or something from some old building but I had to get them during war times and this really old woman was there and she tried to kill meeee D;
/me rubs more firmly, more like a gentle scratching now
03E|
Yeah, my sister has some strange dreams too.
14|K
She had one where there was this giant spider, and for some reason I went towards it, and it turned me to stone.
/me moves so it becomes a nice scratching, arching his back against the one who is kind enough to give him such good treatment!
Then another one where I was a vampire, and trying to kill her.
o__o;;
/me continues scratching, petting teh Espeon ^^
That's probably because at some point I tried to scare her by explaining to her why blood tastes nice.
hahahahahahahaha
O_o
:3
nothing out of the ordinary to see here
/me moves along.
/me stays like that for indefinate amounts of time
14Nope, just me giving Espeon a good belly-rub :>
that is definately the best way to claim me besides !espeon and catching me n.n;
14x3
14brb

Blood doesn't taste nice though....
BLARG
Hey!

Hey. Don't know for certain, but I'm sensing an oncoming troll surge. There have been some odd new additions, like "Spyro is gay", or "N.O.T and the Kimmi kids".
another oen?
god damn
I might be wrong, but I have to say those look suspicious.
12Hey where do you get rock climb ?
07oak
12Oh -v-
07after you beat blue
07o3o
12Lame
Especially with the "MSN messager: SPYRO IS CHAVVY".
12Just flown to wrong place, need to concentrate
:D
Anyway, just wanted to give a heads up. Toodles.
he is a troll
idk if he's like a serious troll with a group
I mean a seriou-- oh.
/me goes to play plaitnum!
14platinum*
14sfa
14f
14as
coz now that he's giving a warning is kind of freaking me out maybe if he's a part of them he's saying another attack's on the way
i've had this dbz game for a few days now
Attack on what?
and i still don't fully understand the battle system XD
14haha
14I have every legendary on Platinum now :D
well i don't fully understand
well tell SR see if he has anything to say about it
what is required for transform
14Wghich game?
or what is the point of that number thing next to the Ki gage
*gauge
12I havent had the patience to go through that bloomin lolcano
I knew he should've stayed banned though srsly :\ something about him has always kinda bothered me
14Stark Mountain? XD
12Yeh whatever it is
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3
14The one with Heatran
12Yes
14EWWWWWWWWWWWW
14DBZ BT2
14GET IT
12That is the most annoying cave I've EVER been in
i don't have a PS2
14I didn't have a problem with it
14ovo
:3
12It's the way it's laid out
14D:
14I didn't have a problem with it
14:P
THAR BE A TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS!
why do you hate 3? XD
12It has a zillion passageways and I always hit dead ends or go somewhere I've already been, all looks the same
:(
14Because it fails compared to 2
can't you be more specific?
14The only problem I had was the wild encounters XD
14The battle system sucks
on 3 when it's for the wii has online play
14The abilities are fail
12Thats why I use repels but not even those seem to last me when I'm in that stupid place
14Compared to DBZ BT2
dari it was different for the mods than it was the members remember they took profiles of [censored] on all the mods it scared me
14BT3 was a absolute waste of money
So?
He didn't care.
well
Also I went and screwed up their site loads, and they got nothing on me.
the fact still remains
i don't have a PS2 lol
14I don't use repels lol
14Well I do
14When I use the PokeRadar
12Does it work in caves?
14The best DBZ game though
14Is Budokai 3
i had a first gen ps3 that could play ps2 games. then it ylod and i got a new one. then THAT one had a defect. then I had to settle with a slim one
14The Radar?
14DBZ Budokai 3 is the best DBZ game
This whole troll thing bored me on spyroforums, can we not just like...not care about it?
i remember Budokai 3
i have to agree
12Yeh
sure unless they post images that will crash the site
14No it doesn't
12Didnt think so XD
Those images don't work.
I tried them on their site.
14lol
But why would they post here?
12IT'S FINALLY COMPLETE XD
12WOW
to be annoying?
14I STILL WANT A BELDUM ><
03BT2 = best
12I really think they messed up on the type of material though
14Sneas
Unless someone tells them to they wont, and who would tell them?
14B3 was better
14:P
because one troll member doesn't like the site and plans a raid?
/me p[censored] out hugs and creeps back under his bridge -- I MEAN, erm, back outside
/me likes BT2 better than B3 :3
14B3 was more interesting
14The fusions weren't permanent
14the transformations weren't seperate characters all the time
14The battling was harder and more fun
/me eyerolls
03I like the story mode and 3Dness better xD
12All that work to make it absolutely perfect to Shadow Lugia's form and yet.. the matieral ruins it all
lol
14brb phone
It's a shame group mods cant ban members though, I wouldn't have had to spend two days loking for someone to brin back to ban those spammers that infested the site lol
in otherwords
it was more realistic
05Nya. Hiya all.
to the anime
12:D
12Y'alright?
14HI
05Mhm.
05Been a while.
12Yeh ..
05-Laughs.- After you posted on my FB, I decided it would be nice to say hi.
12:>
07EXPLODE!
/me giggles, licking Kyu's cheek.
05I don't do that much anymore.
07D:
what on our site?
05Sorry o.o I don't think Tiger's are meant to explode
you can ban members in your particular section
05.. Oooh. I broke 'em.
Yeah, the ones I told you about. That's why the fiction section was clean when you came back but everything else was still writhe with spam
/me plops over here
since he can monitor all sections
I wanted to keep individual mods to their sections
omg are you guys attacked then too?
hmm
no
according to game faqs
	 Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2 is available for the Wii
spam bots got hold of the site when we abandoned it
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcmy3uNZDSE
12That is awesome..
I had to get my old password to spyroforums to do so lol
maybe i should get it
12Hmm, I've spotted a huge problem with the Shadow Lugia costume besides the material as well..
12I think (from the photo) that the fins and tummy are the wrong colour :/
and now that I'm watching over it again you can tell me also
if I need to I'll just get another global op
My God, I hope these lines never come up on the log script.
07o3o
12But aside from those... it's amazing
12It's probably one of the best costumes I've EVER seen
05Nya. That reminds me... I need to contact my friend. :/ He's gonna make my fursuit... I was prolly either gonna get a white tiger or a Typloshion lol
12How much?
hi
05Uhh... Around 800 for the tiger, 780 for the Pokemon
spyros awsome
12..
12Thats a bit cheap..
Cool Hwhip.
that stop motion is pretty cool
05It is. But, he's really good at what he does.
Meow
05I get a discount too
05Sure
I'd volunteer, but I like the fact my title is green in colour lol
12Andrew yeh I know, despite the FOOOOAM the person is talented LOL :3
I dont like orange
05... Wait. Not on this laptop.
wy you put so much enthesis on the h
12Damn
12Has he got any online?
05Might
It's a family guy thing.
12Whats his name?
i know
*looks at logs from 3:35*
spyros awsome
/me badly wants that Shadow Lugia costume XD
12It would just be the best thing at halloween
05I think he goes by the name NikyioWulf
12Found nothing
yes we know thank you
lol
ok
:P
12Absolutely zero results
so
:3
well I'll think about giving you guys the moderation in the general sections at least
I mean no one comes in and goes "spyros awesome"
so you can police those
Yeah, I was thinking that.
05I can have him give ya an email
But still, it's fun.
05Or message on FB
12Bleh
14?
12Im not bothered, I just wanted to see pics
?
12I'm too lazy to go through the trouble of emailing him for them XD
OH! 3:35pm
I was thinking 03:35
05lol
wat are talkin about
I think we should just ignore him, see what he does.
Well I think that would be a good idea, after all, different people are better suited to different tasks, I don't think I'd be able to moderate an art section properly unless I just went off the guidelines set out by the previous art mod
ok
http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=QW-BUSYDAY&Category_Code=QW <-- (y/n)
12Um
05Ooh. I got sumthin to show ya Cuno. One sec... Need ta scan it
12That is somewhat awesome
12brb
><
Congratulations everyone, we've broke the record of most users online at any one time with a whopping 12 users woooo
say what? lol
on the forum?
yes
and yes it would be a good idea
well look at the bright side
Yeah
it's more then last time
That
14LOL
Which I believe was 8 but I cant be sure
We need a bigger community lol
o3o
Well technically 3:29 but :P
The easiest way is to move your forum up in google searches.
I know
@FB
@Dari: Have any suggestions I'm open
12back
I have an idea that isn't an option lol
I don't know how you get it to move up, and there lies the problem.
o//
hm
I thought it just moved up the more people used your site
what the heck is up with Captain Ginyu's special in this game XD
Maybe the more times a term is searched, and that link is clicked?
It moves up when it's the most relevant search that someone clicks, so Dari is right
you a fan of webcomics?
The solution is simple really
Just include the thing that people on the interent search most frequently in your web title lol
But I wouldn't suggest doing so
What game?
when I'm not revising, yar
hehe
that's what I thought
05Ugh. Stupid computer.
I like Dinosaur Comics, although in a weird way it always feels like it's the same joke over and over.
Well, you're first on the list when I search draconic wolves. :P
XD
well their is encoding you can place in the http that helps bring up those words that people search
Such as pronz
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3
I'm pretty sure I hit it pretty good with most of the words that involve our site
Are you really that desperate for new memebers, FB? :P
yeah i'm not much of a fan of that one
an active site is worth paying for lol
Except that doesnt mean you can introduce paid memberships!
when i see a topatoco link i'm like zomg comics
http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html
yar
And, no Dari, I dont think that'd attract the right members, I'd rather not sift through the countless of mature fictions to moderate them, most mature fiction is utter bobbins lol
I'll admit I'm not familliar with any of the others on the list, but I'll totally check them out once exams are done.
hihi o//
05Hello.
2hi BF
Lol.
Haha, a google ad it covering half of the first couple paragraphs.
hi
I searched dragon and forum and I'm on page 10 so far, still no ign of our forum
http://pastebin.com/j8a9bw6e
That's the bit missing from the top of the page btw.
Hmm, so if we set up lots of pages with the link to your forum it becomes higher ranked in google searches.
You could use those freewebs, sites, of whatever?
Or you could just get loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaads of affiliates.
we could
Oh damn, I just read on.
we have a few affiliates and such
Also, the importance of the page that is casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is.
Ha, I just found RDX's FF profile on google
that's easy to find
My profile is first click when you put fresh blood and eragon in the search engine. Or it used to be
So basically if you go on some site that is really high on ANY google search, and post your link on it, then you'll get higher ranked in search.
the University of Sunderland have decided to contact me for the first time since acknowledging my application
Put the link on your youtube profile.
...and it's about a competition to win a Wii
05o.o
o.o2u2
hmm
And on your FF profile.
I have a youtube profile but I almost never use it
and I already have it linked on my FF
A link to mine and John's failed collaboration is second
and my dA
Youtube is a big site, so linking from there might help.
05.. -Eats a shoe.-
07O.O
I'll do another advertisement for the site next time I post a chapter, I've gotten a few new readers since the last advert
Socks taste better
05I bet they do
05Well
05I KNOW they do
05But I ran out.
a page's PageRank = 0.15 + 0.85 * (a "share" of the PageRank of every page that links to it)
"share" = the linking page's PageRank divided by the number of outbound links on the page.
05-Eats the socks.-
Before you say it, I gave the socks you wear in dragon form.
'w'
XP
I have two spare tickets for graduation
And I don't know what to do with 'em
Hmm, interesting.
Ok, time to do a lets play
The more pages on your site, the higher your page rank, but to get an even greater increase from each page, link to the main page on the site that has the greatest number of inbound links.
12back again XD

Pa1ge is censored?

Why didn't I think of that :C
Anyway brb
Infamous and RDX are ancient

sr's 16 and almost a millionare

oi...
He was too smart for me when he was 12

i remember the day before the dollar menu
too bad 100 isn't what it was hundreds of years ago
XD
Who's using my name?
i had to buy a single hamburger for 89 cents.... and they still put pickles and onions on it
wow, that's like a candy bar now

infa z were you alive in the day that vhs systems were 400 bucks
i was in the philippines before that time and everyone (EVERYONE) hada cell phone, even the beggers
i remember the beta!
did you know that the guy who invented the cellphone is the guy who owns Jitterbug?
i didn't know that
they had a special on him on the news a couple weeks ago
12you are

lol a begger and her children were sitting in the gutter talking on their cellphones and texting while asking for money
wow
texting is just a joke

I laugh at how pathetic it is everytime I hear the song "telephone" where beyonce is all like "AND I CAN'T TEXT YOU" I'm like LOL 14 YEAR OLD GIRL
XD
yeah i never really got why txting was so great as opposed to email or instant messenger
or talking :P
lol send their screen name to the fbi as a pedo
infa z it's so that the little girls have something to do while they go and hang out at safeway down the road because there's nothing else good around here at walking distance
they sit outside of safeway all day on their phones with their drinks
There we go.
XD "An internet conglomerate that shall not be named - stupid 4chan - commented on a ton of Justin Bieber videos saying "R.I.P. Justin Bieber," "He was so young," etc. Now, they're claiming he has a drinking problem"

I cringe every time I hear someone say "tweet" or "tweeting"
twitter I mean
It sounds so stupid
tweet tweet
They say it on the news all the time too
the amazing adventures of tweetie
the news and stuff is hilarious sounding with it I think

#OMG Justin? Bieber NUDE on my channel !!

and talking's only really happening in two that I know of
Anyways, what's everyone up to?
lol infa z
I have had so many weird SF members tell me they're in love with me to try to avoid getting banned
O.o

I've just been on IRC since I got home
2 hours ago
Is someone doing that now?
Nothing else?
Nope

Ugh, yes
/me has been doing the same, only for 4.5 hours
he kept insisting he loved me :'D
he was so annoying
XD
Hahahahah
XD
You 2 should do something productive while on the computer
Err, 3.5
Meh
I can't get my numbers straight today
Like what?
Talking to my friends is productive enough :P
:P
I remember around the time I was first modded I was talking to DPX and he said he had a crush on me or something I was like O__o
I'm productive all day at work
Make a song? A game? A story? Webcomic?
lol
So when I come home I just like to have fun
We did make a story actually
so we're good
:P
Since you guys have a medium to chat (this IRC), then you could work together.
I love it when people do that so I can break their little hearts with the LOL SORRY [censored] HERE
Oh that's right, we did
then they cry
Speaking of webcomics, I just read one called Slightly Damned
I get happy when I make people cry :D
We made up a story about the network services and bots
:P
It's pretty good.
LOL SORRY [censored] HERE
that's why I love making sad videos there's always some kid that says HURR YOU MADE ME CRY
lezbo
ah
XD
:P
sorry infa z

Wait you were 11 when you were modded
Too bad the community of it completely sucks...
how old is DPX?
/me cries tears of a thousand flies
he was like 16 at that time
Lol
Haha
he and DFD are in some sort of relationship right now he eventually got contact with her again

This place needs new life
oh cool
Maybe a weekly streamm or something
stream*
DPXxDFD
lot'sa letters
last time I heard from him though she was having more family issues
I still can't really get to like DFD
Because of the thing she pulled with faking her death

Actually
she has to be distracted
It won't work on my computer either
SR disabled his proxy
hmm
so much for that idea
Supposedly he has to have it off to be on some other IRC network
Well, you don't really need the forum for the tournament
psst, it's because he hates you :P
we did it all through IRC last night
He hates me 50% of the time
yeah I know
it'd be easier to set up a time there tough
He's two different people we concluded
yeah
then randomly guess
it does seem like that sometimes....
it seems like the only time it would work is during the weekend
yeah
because of her Australian timezone
75% ge doesn't care, 15% he hates me, and 10% he's my friend
There's only one conclusion
He's 2 different people
:P
Hahaha
or maybe even three different people

he's the one who should be names Doppelgangergang,,,

PTL flew from virginia to NY to go meet Veronica Taylor :P
how old are you anyway?
16, as of yesterday.
Ah happy birthday
lol i just got back from virginia
thanks, man.
anyone see NS in a while?
id personnaly say its just your body chemistry
7She was here earlier.
12o-O
i slept a lot in the afternoon or in class in my mid- late teen years
blarg virigina
i also had quite a bit of depression when i was at that age too
B:2 sounds like how I'd describve it. Yeah, the cause is supposedly genetic. Also, I think it's fairly normal for a teenager to sleep in the afternoon, just not when he/she isn't trying to sleep.
03PTL?
12Brother
what 2 means is that you suddenly knock out right then and there to sleep
12I read that as black Virginia ._.

03the captcha
03the two words
03" Twiddles authorities"
non rem is when you are getting to sleep
03Twiddling authorities is fun :o
That does happen, only not at bad times, exactly. And yeah, if I had it, I'd be into REM within 10 minutes.
Quany~
if thats so then you should see a psychiatrist
it can be dangerous
I wouldn't know, since I'll be asleep, but yes, I know.
That's why I'm trying to figure out if I'm just being stupid or if I really have a problem.
03o.o
03from #PM?

how often does it happen?
i don't think she goes there anymore

7BTW, did you do anything with that small request?
also.. does it happen indifferently to the occation or does it happen when everything is calm or boring
7The sketch of you with you?
Uh
As of now, the latter. But I've come very close to the former.
On
*oh
You mean did I modify it or anything?
Or use it in any way? Nah
From what I know, however, it'd be involuntary.
7Okay.
I just wanted to see how you'd draw me
id probably have a look at a psychiatrist as they can perscribe medicine

All the time, lately. I don't know why.
you got cencored by the censored cat
03you do realize
03that jailbreaking an iPod
03is basically illegal
only if you get caught XD
03no duh
03same with piracy
/me has no intent of getting caught >:P
woah, it's 10 already o.O
Well in a sense, but I'm not pirating anything on it.

03still
I don't have the torrent app.
03that's like
in that sense, the ipod creators hate you
Just cydia
03buying a flash card for DS and then not pirating games
Same. Thanks to a bout of random sleep, I'm wide awake.
12woot
03you alreay have the equipment for it, why not use it?
no
ah
Because
I'm too tired

I want to obey the man.
For your impudence, make two.
drf: but yeah I have no idea what the "HATRED" file is
03orly
Slap her with the gay fish!
or what it is
lol
03I mean
03if Apple caught you
03you'd still be screwed anyway
03so why not pirate stuff on it XD
bla "the man"
:P
/me frantically searches for the hose.
03Brother, "HATRED" is probably the name of the group that pirated it
Because
03I'm guessing
03as some of them have funny names
you people will make me feel like I'm the the nixion years
I'm very legal
03my favorite release group was called "lol"
HATRED file? XD
I'll put an end to this!
03as you'd get these episodes
03blah-blah-lol.avi
03and I'm like LOL lol
An realize how much work goes into programming these apps.
hmm...let me check the global wide internet of pirates
RAWR
/me ignores it

/me throws a safari ball
Especially Orr a security analyst
:O
and I dont particular get their vaugeness XD
For*
"where is the KeyGen?"
we have a cunundrum
"in the HATRED file, duh"
/me yawns again

someone is going to tell where he hides his drugs and we have to find him and stop him
We're already making jokes, I see.
Anyone heard what I said earlier?
xD
About the metroid movie rumor?
03and realize how much I despise APple
03regardless of said work
03:P
03my main arguemene there
03*t
03if it WAS, that might be different
drf: what do you mean? XD
you already hated apple so much so
I don't hate anything.
that you wouldnt mind placing a nuke on their capital
/me hides
I used to love apple, then hate it and now their fine with me.

03I had to go downstairs and reset it
lol, that was a while ago I think
DX
Forget it
Anyone wanna relay that, be my guesst. I'm going to take advantage of the silence and chane the topic.
So... Metroid movie rumor.
I wish I understood what they were talking about on #staff
12o3o
Haha, yeah me too
/me has heard of that
No
I'm the most useless member of the staff, it seems
This one is terrible
/me would rather have a Link movie >:|
12oh?
they parodied that one LL o3o;
/me hides
12I know
03there was one, wasn't there?
03a Zelda movie?
12more than once...
No
12no drf

12those were for April Fools
to make people think there was
Uwe boll is directing it. X-X
since it's like the LOTR to its fan
/me runs
Not true
03what's so bad about Uwe Boll?
03though the name doesn't ring a bell
bah, screw studying
I'm done with school
using MySQL has nothing to do with being Network Op
:P
Google it and you will know
03oh FFS
my grades are pretty set in stone already
03my router's still acting up >_>
so yeah
03Websites are taking forever to load
03LOL, it's a good thing the cable company is coming tomorrow
03I'll stab them with my modem too :D
Okay, I'll try explaining.
DRF
03what
exact same thing is happening to me
except
nothing loads
at all
:V
03It's a conspiracy >:\
03heh
03that happened
03I went and unplugged the router
03plugged it back in
03now IRC works
You're not useless!
D:
actually what's happening is that it's blocking any new connection but keeps ongoing connections (IRC)
Uwe boll is basically called "the next Ed wood" because he makes high name, crappy movies that mostly have to do with video games and he uses German tax exploits to make money off them.
03ah
03:/
He's the reason alone in the dark sucked.
Not useless at all
D:
D:
And if he gets his hands on metroid... *shudders*
>:^\)
combo breaker
He already has the main role casted, so I've heard.
movies and video games simply don't mix
He's going to cast Jessica Simpson as samus D':
Terrible choice
notice how most, if not all of the movie-based video games are bad?
http://movies.ign.com/articles/109/1095682p1.html
ogod
03yeah LOL
03though some video game based movies are alright
It's because of rushed product.
03such as Prince of Persia
03that was quite good'
Yeah, but as a general rule, movie-based video games suck
My father likes the toumb raider movie. The first, that is. He says the rest suck.
Tomb*
03LOL toumb
03sounds British
Don't diss the Brits here, drf
Arti is one.
also, who's going to see The Last Airbender purely to see how much they screw it up?
03I know
At least she lives in England.
lolbrits
03plus Articuno is my friend
03so Ic an make fun of her all I want
/me hides
squeak
03<Absol> also, who's going to see The Last Airbender purely to see how much they screw it up? <-- me LOL
03I mean
12lol drf
03M. Night Shamalan (sp) makes good movies
03but I have a bad feeling about Avatar TLA
I want it to succeed, Absol
killed it
I just want it to.
I WANT TO BELIEVE
/me runs
12Quilly! :D
Yeah
03XD
That's it
03well
/me cuddles~
03the trailer for that movie looked pretty epic, TBH
/me squeaks "heya"
03I saw it in front of PoP
I really want it to be good. I loved the animated series as a 10 year old.
I wmat it to succeed, badly.
03I actually need tow atch the series
03I pirated the entire show on DVD
03I just need to watch it all
Want*
03I only saw the first few episodes when it premiered
03then I missed some
I love the animated series, too, which is half of the reason I believe they're going to screw it up
03and therefore never bothered to watch more
Yo
03since you need to watch them in order
which one?
03well
whoops >> wrong X
the first trailer
or th 2n
03when I first heard about Transformers, the movie
oh no
03I thought it would suck
03but it was really good
03so eh
I didn't quite care enough about Tranformers
:V
Is paramount known for lazy oversight?
whos shadow dragon
12o-o
Uh oh
I still say they're going to screw up the Avatar movie
:V
I would think so.
yes
but only because its trailer sucks
I took it off
just pretend we aren't there
03I know movie studios for different reasons
well the 'current' one
03like, which ones encrypt DVDs and which don't
/me runs
I think the trailer us decent.
Um... Anyone there?
03it was
Hehehe, it's working
the one with the attack at the end?
or showing the battle of the north?
03um
03I don't remember o.o
03there's more than one?
03if so, the longer one.
hmm..
03I could look on YouTube, but I'm really not bothered
03and honestly
the one with the candles at first?
One of the main reasons I think the movie is going to suck is the fact that there's so much plot to the series
like with the epic voice at the beginning?
03I really don't like knowing lots of details about movies
Absol: well it is hollywood
03I like just walking in there knowing nothing about it
Stromy?
03I'm more impressed that way
03XD
I will ay what I said about him being a female organ
anything they create into a movie, they'll just kill most of its actual story
03like some trailers suck
03they give away the plot
*say
lol
yes?
03XD
Oh
look at that
03I mean, some trailers are epic.
he's asking for you
03Like the one for Watchmen
wonder what he wants
03it's my all-time favorite trailer
like clash of ttians?
03the one with the Smashing Pumpkins song
03as it has lots of footage but doesn't tell you anything about the movie
Oh, shoot
03also the one for Harry Potter 5
03that trailer was awesome too
shouldn't have said anything
make him think I'm gone
Just wondering if anyone was here
stromy
pastromy
nightall
03Absol, well, there were 3 trailers for Watchmen
03so that specifies :P
Stromboli
lol
tell him you about to go to sleep anyway
Haven't they heard of /whois though?
I didn't see the Watchmen party
part*
:V
probably not
they could be more sneaky if they used that
WATCHMEN PARTY.
So what's up?
not everyone is versed in the way of irc
I doubt they even know it exists
Life
Life is up.
03LOL\
they probably are like me an dont know irc comands from the azs end of a radish
what did this guy do now?
03XD party
Oh haha...
12o3o
03you know
03Watchmen Party would be good
Feeling left out, LL?
03a party involving watching men, however, .-.
/me runs
03I also made the joke
Shadow Dragon guy
03the tagline for the movie
03"Who watches the watchmen?"
03I respond "Um, me?"
03that movie is quite epic though, for those who haven't seen it
03my disclaimer is it's rated R so get a parent's permission if you're under 16
/me hides
I've seen about a sixth of it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WagTMqdsktg
I don't know if it was Shadow
03what I find funny about Watchmen
Um?
Yeah, my dad didn't realize that until I was at that part.
03guys are all "zomfg nudity <3" when it's girls... but you put any male nudity in a movie and people are all "EWW GROSS"
03I really didn't mind, not that I'm gay, I just ... didn't look there :P
you have a list of this stuff or do you memorize it
03and I mean
03if you were more or less God
03would YOU wear clothes? XD
no
That's a good point
neither
Yes.
Yeah, I couldn't remember who it was
03People just complained waaaaay too much about that
XD
03like "OMFG NAKED GUY"
03I was like meh, get over it
03it's only a total of a couple minutes anyway
03he has a speedo on most of it :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4blSrZvPhU
03yes, that
03most epic trailer ever, right>? :P
o.O
where did the nick alert come from?
No idea
Was it that channel that alerts you when people ghost?
Didn't you say that it alerts you?
Hm
that appears in the console
And that doesn't make the noise
And I just heard it again
Two in a row
hey, can anyone see this?
yeah
the internet went down
had to go to chatzilla
MY NAMES ON THE CD <333333333333333333
and he shares your IP
so maybe that has something to do with it
HI INFA Z
Because your old nick is still here
Use that command I just gave you
it will destroy the clone
o.o
Now you can just change your nick back
I am going to scan it
:D
hm?
shadow dragon is back
woo
What the hell did I miss?
nothing special really
exciting stuff
...
Uh huh
an angry RPer
he likes dragons
who sucks at arguing
who really likes dragons
why would he need a spy?
XD
his response to everything is "look into your past"\
To see if I'm around
So he can talk about me behind my back
And call me a male organ
So
..okay...
Like what?
like immediately
How is everyone doing this evening?
and Shadow had just asked if she was there
I was just being sarcastic about me joining being exciting
never mind
/me ish...meh o3o
12yous?
and I think Shadow was siding with him in the later argument
Ohhh
Good idea
do it
12i'm okay
XD
Hehehehe
Mwahaha!
...bye
I'm doing fine myself.
make it seem more legit
meh
over here is as fine as 103 degrees can get
If he knows anything about IRC he still knows I'm on the network though
thatw as perfect
Orly
Prove it :p
Hehe
Haha, nice
Play along

O.o
Shadow just left!
Use the "!weather" command.

12its cool here~
03today's weather was nice
03it was like 68
03good for cutting the grass
NY is not cool though

/me hides
03I was only a *little* sweaty XD
since he's oper now
oh yeah
03oh wow
Hmm
i bet hes got his name locked down
03there's a TV channel called WOmen?
03That is not sexist at all
You live fairly close to me, ll. We share the weather.
I don't know if mine is
I'm tempted to ask permission to test that with yours
it'd be sexist if they called it
/me muses about combining BET with Women, you'd get one super-exclusive racist and sexist channel!
lol
woMEN
/me runs
:p
03my TV guide shows it in all caps
XD
I was just going to see if you wanted to do that
03WOMEN

WHUT
I don't know, but I hate when we swap names.
It gets annoyinh.
03that's just funny LOL
*annoying
it'll kick you off his
Maybe it has something to do with the time it was registered?
I don't know
maybe
that makes sense
like registration used to do that and now it doesn't anymore
After all, according to his DOX he is a high-ranking member in SpyroForum.
that makes sense
:P
A spy!]
:o
:O
Imagine that.
And I'm really a fake oper
/me restrains drf.

Can't wait until we fully-develop this excuse to get rid of him.

Stay on target...
here it comes
boom
how weird
wait, actually
RDX's nick didn't used to do that
/me directs teh chat to the #rp room for this nonsense.
you should ask him next time he's on
I impersonated him once
o.O
How long ago was that?
The*
When we both switched names and made fun of each other
I did a few days ago, and received a warning from Sir.
Like last year
I'm proper like that :p
hmm
Nu

No is the correct word
He would have to be to have op

Get it right.
oh right
who knows
Niet o3o
12Laa?
yeah
I don't think RDX even does
man... i want a pizza..
I tried asking him about it once
lol
I think we asked him once
its too late for me right now
I just thought it was some oper thing
o.O
I'll stay for another 30
and man im tired too
Me too. Only the sleeper agents would deliver me pizza at this hour.
12Laa?
Then I'll join brother in dreamland.

!define froyo
-!- Frozen yogurt (also known as frozen yoghurt or by the tradenames Froyo and Frogurt) is a frozen dessert made from, or containing yogurt or other dairy products. It is slightly more tart than ice cream, as well as lower in fat (due to the use of pure milk instead of cream). ...
I played the PS2 version. Fun for the era.
There are rumors of a PS3 version.
also the code name for android 2.2
03yeah
03Android 2.2 looks fricking sweet

you have some? :|
no
I thought you meant FAHRENHEIT XD
too bad.
I got it second on the page
I have 100 terms per page.
Which is why I said it was first page, but about 50 down.
well it's second down on mine
Yes...Because you have more like 20 terms per page.
tk.
well it looks better that way lol
Which means that before it was on page 4/5.
o.o
For you, anyway.
why do you have 100 links per page
.o.
I went on advanced search, and specified 100 links per page, because it's quicker to see where the forum is listed.
anyway how are all
o3o
oEo
ah I see
so what like sites did you use for like connecting and such
in your A to B to C
wait how did you get there
Just 3 topics in the spam forum.
Yup
But using those pages brings it up to about the max PR you can get from just within your site.
So the rest has to come from external links.
ah
i dunno lets hope nothing unfortunate happened
ya
what does that bring the Page rank to then
SF has a 3
I guess we'll see soon enough :3
06.....
huh?
06I wonder if I'm bipolar ._.
ok that sounded
awkward
xD
you think?
>:
Why do you say that, Roara?
yes for various reasons
/me hugs ^-^
/me gets off you and curls up as she's hugged
Still 1, probably means it's just ahead of other sites with 1.
06...woah Aero's here :)
Yesh~
sweet
advanced grade 1 lol
06well, I get these random moments of being really stressed and anxious from stupid things, and then out of nowhere I'm totally happy again
i didn't have any problem with it but whee
06and then I go right back to being stressed
06and vice versa
^^
/me doesn't think they would be able to do much anyway :P
The more links a page has on it, the less it's worth, the more links it has to it from other pages the more it's worth.
Perhaps it's one of those hormonal things with growing? O:
/me waits and sees
yeah
06x-x
awkwardness, lets hope there's nothing to see apart from fluff
06well if it's inheritable from parents, then it's very likely
06my mom has it
Watching Mythbusters
You?
dealing with forum issues
yes
Well, if it's affecting your everyday life to the point where you can't focus on the regular things you do. Perhaps see a doctor of some sort?
06dunno, I hate doctors
06I already have to go in for foot surgery lol
O:

4I don't care
idc if you are somewhat harsh
I really don't
especially with Allen
since he's a freaking moron anyways
I see my plan worked.
Oh, thank you
no problem
Wow, why do we allow him anywhere?
anyway
just to give him a chance
12back later

I know he's a [censored] class A
and it's only a matter of time before we ban him

06I disagree with his quit

06hey if you see my bone down there, I swallowed it earlier, bring it up, k?
i am gonna cry now
wait i didn't know a wolf had hairball problems
Just as luck appears in three, so does misfortune. Because you don't want to see it, you don't see it coming. Even if you notice it, you don't say anything. Even if you're told, you don't listen. Then boom, the end comes!
06I never said hairball
06I said bone
o-O
you could have just asked, psychic would make it easier and more funny
and o3o
06but a drool covered espeon is funnier
have you ever given a cat a regular bath even? >:|
06wow I forgot how much I love these videos...
06espeon, yes
ok
06my cat actually loved it lol
just so you know what to expect. and oh? oO
06whenever I took a shower or bath, she'd jump in with me lol
4lawlbanned
that's a coolcat
06her sister HATED it though
06she jumped in with the cat who loved water, not realizing what she was jumping into, and I never saw her the rest of the day
hahaha
typical cats =P
they are so curioussssss
/me returns with bone and everything, happy now?
If petrol prices ever get over $3.50/gallon, I'm gonna do a sign that says "Sick of gas prices? (insert shock site here)"
that would actually work
/me puts Greg in a pokeball
like that "sick of politics? <a certain fruity party>.org is the answer!" thing I saw once
07hey Roara o3o
07did you see that finished pic of the shadow lugia costume? o3o
06the wut
07o3o
07Arti talked about it a while ago before it was finished o3o
duuuude
WHY did it make me think of METAL GEAR
mmmm - my favourite quote^^
If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation. What's true for the group is also true for the individual. It's simple: Overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.
06holy.....................
07that's a very lengthy anecdote o3o
06that costume...
it is, but true
I hope no one minds my post
03sigh, I'm starting to hate digital cable
06except for the fact I wouldn't be able to touch it, that costume is amazing beyond belief
and the motto for a roleplay character I played once was that:
When you're neither right nor wrong it's time to beat the drums and attack. When talking fails, it's time for violence.
cute
did I mention sometime's nice to be on the dark side? ;)
07lol
12kyu lol'ed
07I don't get the first sentence o3o

03A woman went to the doctor's office where she was seen by one of the younger doctors.
03After about four minutes in the examination room, she burst out screaming as she ran down the hall.
03An older doctor stopped her and asked what the problem was, and she told him her story. After listening, he had her sit down and relax in another room.
03The older doctor marched down the hallway back to where the young doctor was writing on his clipboard.
03"What's the matter with you?" the older doctor demanded.
03"Mrs. Terry is 71 years old, has four grown children and seven grandchildren, and you told her she was pregnant?"
03The younger doctor continued writing and without looking up said,
03"Does she still have the hiccups?"
/me snorts

YES

they use them all the time
I dont like football either but I'll watch the world cup
I see them all the time
I don't care about soccer at all, I probably won't watch but I'll gloat if we win.
If I find out we win.
Something.
Otherwise, I'm probably going to just be silent about the whole thing.
Such is life.

I do.

You talk a lot
Disgraceful.

Hello.
06....a preview for "The Incredibles" was on "Destiny Deoxys"?
06lol
I have blown up the world.
god damn dude hahaa
7that you secretly hoped had happened
The realization of this fact may take some time.
7:p
I am sure you all will become accustomed to this eventually.
it's a shame there will be no Spyro movie
well TLoS failed anyways, it would've been lulzy
jlf i'm happy there's no movie
it would've sucked so bad
07?
7have you noticed that xkcd is getting gradually less funny? it's like michael jackson's dancing abilities the whiter he got
But what a way to go, huh?
LOL
All the dust and the explosion and the... uh.
What was I talking about?
I must fill up the page.
Yes.
This is a valid strategy.
no jlf it'd just be spyro fighting a bunch and then some magical anime power would come and save him from death and everyone would die at how terrible the film was.
There is a cost, though.
I am sure it may or may not irritate some people.
the dragonball z movie sucked

i do wonder if they'll be anymore Spyro games though? :/
oi
Supercalm.
7if I could do fury attacks that long in the game, I would be able to soar through every single super enemy
do you have a sugar quota
It's been a long time since I've used /ignore, but the "USA" chanting did it for me.
i never used my fury too much on bad guys
7the reasons for which were never explained beyond 'bragging rights' and why they were all just secluded in individual areas, even though they were damn near invincible and only fury attack could take them out, they should be the spearhead of Malefor's army
i only used it on elites and bosses
Good god do you just type every thought that pops in your head?
that is why they invented /ignore though
I know...but he's right, I'd feel mean then
Cant I just devoice him for a bit?

06musta been all the running in the sand yesterday
Hey, look at that. They're releasing TF2 on Mac tomorrow.
Strange, I would expect Valve to do that stuff at E3
i forgot about e3
Next Spyro game is all but confirmed to appear at E3
I'm sure he does lol
http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=3923&p=1
Lol
ut the questiong is will it be good...
but*
/me highly doubts it
Well I sure bet it will
Meh
Spyro has sucked since it stopped being a platformer
... activision ummm doubt it scores over a 7/10
Technically it still is a platformer...
But Blizzard is taking it over
LoS is a platformer?
My dog has suddenly gotten old...he's just lying here...doing...nothing
Technically it is...
hai Quan
It seems more like a hack-and-slash to me...
7Hey, Aero.
comination i guess
not really its more action
It is under the category of platformer.
how's you?
Says who?
I personally only liked the first 3 games, ANB, and DOTD
Suddenly?
Most websites
Hm
Like Nintendo and Activision
7Okay. o3o
7FINALLY downloading a 100MB .zip file. O_o
Well then, if that's true, I'll change my phrasing
Yeah, suddenly
ahh
06ugh
06I need food
Change it at will
7Hey, Rora.
Spyro has sucked since the start of the LoS series
:P
06but I don't wanna walk all the way downstairs
:)
7O3o
/me gives Aurora a cup of ramen noodles?
06my legs and arms and abs are like jello right now
/me 7teleports Rora a cookie
wait blizzard is taking it now?
Yes
hmm
Didn't Blizzard and Activision merge or something like that?
Activision Blizzard is a single company
yah
well thats no good
And ever since, all the games pouring out are completely awesome.
Well all I know about Blizzard is they do WoW
really?
And since I've never played WoW, that doesn't tell me anything
Yeah
Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft, WoW
Those are the big 4
But those were made a while ago
my brother in an adict of wow...
100MB is a fairly small file. :o
7When compressed. o3o
I use to play it...
7Unzipped, it's 500.
the only thing i really watch him do on there is fight really important bosses
Same as what he thinks about alcohol :P
But I didn't care for the price
lol
it's just never interested me much
i'm not addicted to alcohol cause i dont really like it that much
wow or alcohol
WoW
lol
I plan to drink when I'm old enough
Lol no
I'm not going to drink when I reach 21
cheap stuff sucks... some of the expensive stuff sucks
fail
that is not the right answer
you wanna PARTY AND HAVE FUN!
Cool party!
well so do I, but it's not like drinking a little is going to kill them all...
I HAEV PARTEE
yay
i graduate in two hours
That guy at work won't leave me alone
12I like adult parties.
hm?
there a drunk hitting on you stromy?
I don't think he's drunk though lol
does he work there?
Yes
Aww, he's growling in his sleep
you cant really have relationships with other employees i dont think
And unfortunately, I'm going to have to work in his team from now on
:D
XD
XD
XD
He's dweaming
lol
thats an awesome idea
if lamdbda would have that sort of disposition
...
I came in at the wrong time...
lol why?
hmm i thought i saw something in there about something like that
ah well...
It sucks though
if he gets intrusive tell your supervisor or the assistant manager
An artist...
hm?
by who?
Because I could have at least avoided him if they didn't realize I was supposed to be in setup
traitors :P
wha?
I didn't say anything
just me
:D

coz I'm the coolest

what did you need help with?
A game
i dont know if i might be of any help though as i am just starting
hm?
/me has to go redownload uTorrent
I will send a GDD to you if you are interested.
what is gdd?
Game Design Document
uh... i have no idea what that is really
It's what people make that contains the story, gameplay, and every aspect of the game
hmm
It's basically a list of everything that goes into a video game
Developers make them to keep themselves from straying from the original idea
what are you using to make the game
Torque3D
never heard of it
Torque 3D is the game engine
Like the Source engine, Unreal engine, Unity engine, etc.
4hk
ok
3d isnt my sort of thing though.. thats along the line of SR
:O
4literally
Hey :)
i took a look at blender the otherday and had no idea what to do
yeah
He doesn't seem like the person willing to help
he showed me some of his work and hes decent
03LOL, "If you're going to kill yourself, do it off campus, because it's a buttload of paperwork"
He did that 3D model of Spyro that's the current contest on the forum
hes got his own things to do
06LOL
I doubt he'd help you though
He helps when he feels like it
And that's not very often
id like to learn 3d but i dont have the time or motivation to do that
Plus my speeds suck today
Actually I wonder why he's not here right now
like 332
nor money at the moment
ping timeout
He's on #epic-chat
is he homeschooled or something?
Yes
thats what i though... hes on here constantly whether here or not
epic-chat and of course all the oper channels
But not his own channel
Where is the model he posted?
Announcements
Don't ask me why he put a contest there =/
how does torquq work anyway?
Torque is a game engine, not a 3d renderer like Blender
i could try, but >.< booting into windows, & i haven't done any "serious" encoding on megui since half a year?
A game engine is where you put all the code, models, and sound together to make the actual game.
yeah but i mean what exactly does it help you do
03on what, movie 12?
ah i see
03wwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Found the model...
03LOL, theme song after an entire 6 minutes
03that's a long time
That's... Decent?
Hi
03Hi :3
12SNEAS
o.O
03AZURE :3
12I almost have the layout done
12XD
03Yay x3
Looks exactly like Spyro to me
Hmm...
exactly how he appears in the games
03Are you going to add it so we'll have 3 layouts?
i think he ripped the model from somewhere
Well yea, but you can see the triangles, the grass isn't volumetric...
That's what I expected
so what up
12Yus :3
12All that I need to do when I'm done with it, is cut it apart and code it.
I wonder what SR's reaction would be to his model being called "decent"
12XD
XD
12Ok
About to do Calculus
12I'm done
03:3!
fun fun
that sucks
probably wouldnt care
lol
I dunno
03NOW TO DISSECT IT AND REABBEMBLE IT.
i doubt that
lol
12LOL INDEED
Lulz
I've seen him get offended at stupid things like that before
03reassemble
do you have a screenie of the opening battle with dawn&ash vs the twins with a shot of the clouds?
Me too
/me runz
Well just be glad he's not here
03no
XD
i never seen him do much out of the way
03I could GET one but I'm currently watching stuff already
he did get mad at this one O guy
Haha, that guy is annoying
When was this?
Sort of difficult to know if he will be angry or not.
but nothing more than the typical annoyance that comes in here
12XD
Didn't we have this discussion before?
I am getting deja vu...
If we did, I wasn't around
dont think so
i dont remember it
But yeah, he annoys me too
sr or o
12http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c354/mystic_dragon98/LayoutV1copy.png
Well both lol
12o:
12:o
But mostly O
lol
/me hides
You say something, and then you think "Ohh crap, he's going to get angry".
4http://verydemotivational.com/2010/05/31/demotivational-posters-ladies/
Then he doesn't
And then the opposite happens and you think "He won't be offended"
After we kicked him out of here for flipping out at us for correcting his chatspeak, I found out he'd made 3 accounts
03That's awesome :o
And he starts getting angry at you
12Ty :D
Spyro1,2,3ftw, Spyro1,2,3ftw!!! and :O
he has like a few thousand dollars worth of software in 3d imagetry i would think he would display something with it
12It should look better once it's on a webpage but yeah
12xD
xD
No
He pirates
So I busted him for it on chat and he denied it and said his brother did it all
really?
Yea
Yeah, SR pirates
He used to be really touchy about it too
everyone pirates duhhh
that explains the pirate chips in the pic
He posted where he got Torque3D online, a $1000 piece of software
*ships
I didn't pirate
I made a joke about it once and he was /pissed/
12OH WAIT
Because it would ruin his reputation or something
12I need to make a styleswitcher button
12D:
12And
Everyone knows though...
Tv becomes very dull from midnight onwards :(
really..
Yeah, this was a while ago though
Like when Spyrochat was new
12I might need help trying to get the styleswitcher to work
12cuz I can't remember
12XD
And what reputation? The only reason people don't show anger towards him is because he is the owner...
03Ok :3
And people who don't know him
12Ok
/me will try though
12X3
12XD
I've lost a lot of respect for him over certain things
Pirating is one of them
I remember that I made a thread on "What kind of computer do you use", and I posted one of my Macs... He is apparently a Windows fanboy...
yep
yeah, I remember that thread
06....ffff I forgot how creepy regirock is in the 8th movie
he likes hp too
Started getting angry at me, and I was like "Dude, make another thread about it if you want, this isn't the thread for it"
But you seemed pretty much like the typical Apple fanboy to me, so I wouldn't be talking if I were you :P
Then he PMed me and said that if I say something like that again I would be banned
Apple fanboy?
Far from it, I don't like everything Apple does
Seemed like it from that argument you were having
Ooo, th ebest bit of the twilight film
Sure, I like Macs and I like iPods... But everything else? No thanks
Like it looked like you were slightly offended when SR said Apple computers were "effeminate"
mac has more than macs and ipods?
lol
iPads
holy shit
Yea, the iPhone, iPad, and some TV box thing.
aw man
That's not much else
:P
jeez
fresh pad
son of a
Earphones, MobileMe
This is so freakin... don care anymore :P
Yeah, but those are minor
4the end?
Look, everyone likes iPods, and I like one other Apple product
No, the bit where they play baseball
It's not the fact that you like them
It's the fact that you were defending them to the death
4......
Also, I don't care for iPods myself
I wasn't defending them to the death, I just wanted to justify why I liked them
if they weren't so proprietary i might have an ipod
I didn't bring up the fight
Again, see what I said about being offended at the "effeminate" comment
I like ipods nothing else
i like my sansa
it was a pretty heated argument
Post a link please? It was a long time ago
I can't get on SF
lol she has been banned
lol
Unless SR got his proxy back up
by her dad
which I doubt
Wait... Then how do you remember "effeminate"?
And now that that bit is over, time to continue channel surfing
I don't even remember it!
Because I thought it was funny
...
whats effeminate about a mac anyway? cause its white?
It stood out to me because it's such a stupid thing to be offended about
Okay, let me just find this thread again...
no infa z because it's an apple and apple is for vegetarians
i like apples
and vegetarian men are gay
:P
thus making macs effeminate
XD
Okay...
I just took that completely out of context
How so?
Wait a second
Of course I would be offended by an effeminate comment!
...
The /computers/ are effeminate
Not the people who use them
Ohh
Good (relative) evening people.
youd just be effeminate by association :P
:P
I'm trying to remember what I posted it about...
Wow...
I'll have to look at the thread again when I can get access to SF
But I'm pretty it was clear SR meant the computers, not the users
03:3
/me squeaks
missionary of what?
Wrong nick >>
:P
:P
12X3
14back and stuff
ah
12Wb
12xD
i thought he was the one that argued against it
14ty :3
12Wheee~
Nah
12Yw :3
He's been defying the no religion rule since we first put it up
Not that I care at all
Actually, scratch that
"LOL NOT MEANING TO BREAK THE RULE BUT THE GUY IN THE BIBLE SAID THIS"
14:>
"We" didn't make the rule, SR did
yeah..
Ohh, now I remember why I was angry at SR!
I never liked it
he's thinking of taking it down though
Well good
About freaking time
well i sortof would agree with sr on that because it just creates drama and the littlest thing would piss someone off
He said I did not know what I was talking about when I was talking about making an application
/me rubs on Azure
It offended me because he took it out of context
I do
Only when I'm angry though
14going to bed shortly though :<
/me meeps and gently pokes Quilava ouo

O can't wait until Friday. Hehe. World Cup for the awesome! :P
Good, now I remember why I lost respect for SR
Anyways, that was one of the things 888 attacked us for
/me 7blinks
7DANG YOU, ARTI. :|
888?
Unnecessary censorship
/me meeps again
Ohh
wait, they had reasons for attacking us?
hello
14Unless you guys has some ideas to keep me awake XD
(Also, Saturday which will have the /hilarious/ match up of: USA versus... England.
But they came up with excuses
12Hi C:

I'm still watching it actually
That'll keep you awake
That movie is terrible
Until you're done
lol ive seen that on g4
It's even worse than the book
Then you'll fall RIGHT asleep
/me RUNS!
And that's saying a lot
14:P
Never read the book so it's passable
/me gropes Azure
4the characters are horrible
Don't even get me started on my rant about how much twilight sucks
/me owo's
4the writing is horrible

I dont care that much about it so you'd be wasting your time

I'll have to borrow my sisters dvd of new moon

Just rent it when it's like a dollar
And Stephenie Meyer won't make any money off it
14'3
14;3*
People I meet on the interent are so vindictive lol
Bella is even more of an idiot in New Moon
She throws tantrums and becomes insane because Edward leaves
12X33
Ugh, the G20 Summit is occuring soon... I'm verily disliking it as... yay for the billion spent on the summit... all of taxpayers dollars. Money that would be better suited to things like - I don't know... health care, education, public services, the military, everything but this stupid summit. (I wonder how big of a hike this venture will cause to my taxes...)
12X33
Although it's /hilarious/ to watch on film
/me snugs with Azure ^^
The only thing I dont like about this film is Bella's little naratives she does from time to time
/me licks :3
squeak~
X3
14:o where be you licking ;3
So you like that Edward and Bella have no personalities and are completely obsessed with each other?
True dat Quil~ xD
And that there's no plot and what little plot there is makes no sense?
12O:
I dont think about it that much, I just watch
12Wing?
/me shot
14:P
I tried to go into it with an open mind, and I couldn't take the movie seriously at all
/me licks Azure's wing back then :)
The acting and special effects are both horrible
/me yays C:
4I got evicted from New Moon
X3
And those are things they could have fixed, unlike SMeyer's story
Yes well I haven't read the books, dont like or dislike the film, and have no particular interest in defending it or criticising it. Just remember, you started this conversation lol.
Lick something else Azure? :o
/me ruuuns
Also... why are they having the summit in Huntsville of all places?
Yes well excuse me if I dont listen or comment, it's nothing personal lol
12O:
And if the summit is in Huntsville why did they close of downtown Toronto?
That's no problem
12Oh u
/me runs
14XD
And LoS critic
x3
:P
you dont really bring that up near as much as twilight
I barely ever bring up Twilight
Only when someone else mentions it
/me licks Azure in other places :3
Well I actually like LoS but i'm not going to argue about that either.
i see you bring it up everynow and then
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard all the criticisms before anyway
/me meeeps X33
03iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
12X3

03lulz
Exactly
i like [censored]ins
deal with it
12:3
I only enter a discussion if they ask for my opinion, then they'll inevitably tell me their's, then there'd be a rebuttle and then I'd lose interest lol
If someone likes or dislikes something I don't, I don't care
Just as long as they don't tell me to shut up when I criticise their opinion
/me randomly pounces Azure before sleeping
You can't really criticise an opinion though
yeah you can
And here'sa question... if the world leaders are just /residing/ in Huntsville, and they have to commute to Toronto... are they going to close the 400 just so Obama, Merkel, Dimwit^WHarper, and the rest can drive to Toronto?
I just did with Twilight
You can try to persuade them otherwise
But not criticise an actual opinion
That is the "actual opinion"
Your opinion was that Twilight was good
I criticised that
No no, that's not what I said
/me runs
Of course, it didn't change what you thought of it
06>_>
I only said the baseball part was good
/me nuzzles her, then hugs everyone else ^^
But I still criticized it
The rest is passable
Well you said it was decent then
/me nuzzles back c:
You didnt actually criticise the baseball lol
12Cya!
And I disagreed, therefore criticizing your opinion
i criticize your arguement
LETS ALL BE HAPPY
Night~! <3
:C
It;'s ok
03bye
shut up fresh pad
lol
I don't get how it's going in circles, but OK
Might watch The Cottage now...supposed to be funny but I bet I just end up throwing up
... banjo dude killed chat
?
Lol?
brb, food's ready
k
What ye be having, ye scally wag?
fresh blood
And why are they spending $57,000.00 on a fake lake in the press center? Can't the moron reporters just... you know... drive to one of the bazillion lakes in Ontario? (They don't even need to get /near/ Huntsville... Just drive to Barrie! And voila, perfect "Canadian" setting...
That'd be more a drink though, surely?
some people can eat it
And better... why a fake TSX? Is it too difficult to inconvienence the /real/ TSX? I mean you've already closed off most of the downtown core of Toronto.
in the philipines they put it in flour and roll it up into a dumpling
But then it wouldn't be fresh
it can be fresh
She could be having Black Pudding
or as they call it "chocolate meat"
I'll stick with what we call it
:P
Personally I dont have much taste for it, its not very pleasent
I didnt even like cooking it when I worked in our sandwich shop
never had it so i could say
*couldnt

Nope, an Englishman

Yeah, I prefer my laptop
if they hd something like the cintiq in a portable fashion like that i would buy it in an instant
man its quiet here

they try to immitate the english accent?
Alright... I think I've ranted enough about the G8/G20 Summit moronicity for one day. Now... what ought I to do now...

Well I got the Ipad and then laughed and said this is where you try to sell me the extras isn't it? He shook his head and said we dont try to sell you extras, we just offer different ways of making your ipad experience all the better. I said he didn't have to and he said ok and left it at that
:'(
what are they supposed to do with them then?
o.o
Where was the push for the sell?!
I'm probably going to re-clean this minicomputer I own...
07feed them to birds
12XD
He could have made more commission...but I guess he may not have been on comissiion
12>:
>_<
commission*
Meh, pay it no mind. As I said, I dont care lol
:D
OK
X_X
K
Mostly, because of the fact that it still smells of what the original operator stored between the backplane and the tape drive.
12Almost done tearing apart layout
I care more about that fact you have admin and I dont than I do about twilight lol
Well again, I can't do anything about that
I know lol
:P
But still
:(
ugh now i smell like fish ....
:O
Who is?

03Yay :3
at least your computer doesnt have a virus
*favorite
(Explanation: The computer was owned by a university. It was brand new in the 60s. The former operator was a hippy. When disassembling the computer for transport... hey guess what! Hippy operator stashed a bag of weed in the machine. (Intelligent man, he.))
jonny craig duhhh
FavoUrite*
crunk ass redneck
What's the point of a silent 'u'?

Because it changes the sound of the word
03:3

So you say it like "fa voo rite"?
wow
(So now... the backplane smells horrible. And I've already cleaned /everything/ with rubbing alcohol. Three times.)

(By the way, nothing is funnier then sliding a computer out of a 19" rack, and hearing a dean of a university going: "Is that a bong!?")

oi... english man vs grammer nazi
send that to him.
/me sniffs Azure o3o

It's my language anyway! lol
I don't get how not having an extra letter in there makes the pronunciation like that
You;re just abusing it
I'll let you do it
/me is poked
Yus? :3
He'll be home any minute lol
Everyone had a good (uncomfortable) laugh, the computer was promptly sprayed with an entire can of air freshener, and now a small room in my basement houses a computer that still smells like a hippy.
Quite a few of our words have a u after an o
I know
12Nothing, nothing
Or an o in front of an e
12xD
And I've never understood it
Lik Oestrogen
:P
thats awesome
(At least it works. Unlike hippies. :P )
/me sniffs more :3
And that looks like it would be pronounced "o EE strogen"
BLLLLLAAAASSSSSSTTTTTOOOOOOIIIIIIISSSSS
Its amazing how happy a little piece of cardboard printed with ink can make a child.
03py
its not even money.
And I've never understood why you dont use it lol it just seems like after your gained your independence you just got lazy and took letters out of words so you didn't have as much to write
^_^ haha So mean and yet.....SO TRUE
nah, it's because we're practical and efficient
We don't put in unnecessary letters
:P
its not even worth that much either i dont think
/me meeps o:

14Screw it can't sleep

Or less elegant :P

it was a simpler time.
14Bloody hot weather XD
Yeah I think a pack of Pokemon cards is like $5
color vs colour...
14and ty
12X3
12Yw
never got that
wow thats expensive.
I should have started a trading card game.
12Wait
03hi
Lulz
14Hey
Has to be Colour. I know color is how you spell it but color doesnt even look like a word to me
12Nvm
The reason some of them are valuable is that they don't print off as many of some of them
/me shot
yeah
Thats where the money is, and once you saturate the market with a ton of cards, make a few new characters.
i remember getting the coveted charizard card
;3
/me runs
coloor
make new "rare" characters/.
:P
How do you spell Flour?
I never had any rare Pokemon cards
Lolwut
12Pfft
12xD
I played pokeman for a little while.
i also had a freakin huge ass legendary bird japanese card
I didnt actually play it, ujust collected the cards.
12I thought of a question
the thing was as large as a magazine
By my reasoning you should spell it Flor
Now I have tons of cards because a kid I babysit gave me about 60 of them
12but then I thought of how to solve it immediately after
12So yeah
12|D
i had a lot
"thanks for playing with me" *hands me a ton of cards*
I remember trying to counterfeit the cards.
/me shrugs
lol i got a venasaur card still have it around somewhere
o.o
The u makes the uh sound at the end of the word
No
Like in Armour
omg I used to have this book that would tell the difference between real and counterfeit pokemon cards
Because you need the extra letter for the extra syllable
it has to do with color tints
X3
or something
its flour here and armor as well
armour is a company i think
So why not in colour or in armour, or even Humour?
that makes potted meat and vienna sausage
XD
Or Favour
i dunno i just say you english people are all kinds a f'ed up and leave it at that :P
Because that would make them "coloor," "armoor," "humoor," and "favoor"
Teletypes get really annoying after a while...
lol but thats what I dont get, you shouldnt call what you speak and write english because that's not what it is lol
In fact, that's what we call the language that you speak
its a dialect not annother language
It's still the same language
Just a different dialect
Not officially, but between ourselves
what he said
12x33
if you go to germany, one side cannot under stand each other even though they speak the same language
I hate it when they use the foil on the cards
its too hard to copy.
but they both speak english
So now I have a ton of Pokemon cards I don't know what to do with
Just repent your ways and rejoin the empire underthe queen, we'll forgive you. I promise
(Namely, my ASR-33 is a bit... annoying. Output faster!)
Nevar!
(And also, be more quiet!)
ya still have a queen?
:P
Lol, monarchy
That said I cant understand the welsh sometimes
Or the scots, or the irish depending on how thick their accents are
How do I tell if it's counterfeit?
different tints and shades on the pictures
i can understand some irish but i never really talked to anyone strait from it
just seperate some tints into sepreate piles there should be 2 kinds
I canny do eet! I dun 'ave the powar!
Hmm
just makes me think that i'm talking to a pirate
I got some Japanese ones
/me x3
I can not do it. I dont have the power! <<<< Scot
I don't get why they say "Pocket Monsters" on the back
isnt that europe?
The work shop manager at work is scot, he sounds like that ;lol
that's what they used to be called lol
"Pocket Monsters Card Game"
But it's Japan
im sorry but I g2g
they were pocket monsters before they were pokemon
poke= poket mon=monsters
They should write it in Japanese like it's the rest of the card
Well yeah I know that
and yeah youre kinda being loud
12O:
Pokemon = Pocket Monsters
Hmm, and there lies the problem in staying up late, I'm hungry...
I just don't know why the back of the card is English when the front is Japanese
go to a mcdonalds and buy the biggest cheeseburger you can for half a pound
12OKAY
50p wont buy a burger
I'd need 99p, just short of a Â£
12Now I'm done with the layout
And even then that burger is tiny
it's too hard to tell the different tints
12I need to figure out how to freaking code it
12D|
/me does not want
ha
the lighting in my room sucks
/me chews Azure >:3
what is the cent version of the pound
03Sigh
A penny
p
pennies p and pounds Â£
so you say that you have 20 pennies when you have a 0.20 peice?
/me meeps as she's being chewed on o:
No, then I have 20p
just say p?
03D:
Yeah
short for penny
Lick the card, if your toung turns purple its a fake.
Lol
03xD
I'm not 6 :(
/me morphs into a Shadow Lugia :o
12True.
12D:

/me licks Azure ;3
03I would help
And you can call $s bucks and we can call Â£s quids
gtg bai everyone~
/me dies
My Kabuto card is fake then
03But
i have some euros around here but i may as well just put it in the scrap book as its worth more in there than for monetary value anymore
I'm finally promoting~ :D
/me doesn't know how to code layouts
quids?
03XD
12XD
Yeah
12I do
Bucks?
12My way
12but
i don't remember which one's counterfeit lighter or darker
12I can't
12xD
but one set would be counterfeit
probably lighter
12Lol
12Licking me is enough to kill you?
/me runs
so you say 20 quids when you have 20 bucks
do people still pay big bucks for pokeman cards?
that would make all of mine that I've looked at so far /except/ that one fake then
No idea
OH MY GOD SHUT THE [censored] UP
14Looks like someone can't handle a Lugia ;3
12XD

12-f
because it was probably reall ham lol
12xD

Poor at the moment, the government put us in debt and no one wants to really buy and sell real estate

03E:
12:3
so the buyers market is good then
I dont have a chance in getting a house any time soon
12X3
hmm
No, bad, prices are through the roof
Problem is, no one can sell because they cant buy to move into
03Only I get that treatment. :3
Lolz
if no one is buyin then prices should go down
that makes me sad
12XD
14lol Sneas
At least that's as far as I understand. Doesnt help that they tax all the new buyers simply because they're a new buyer
03HAHAHAHA BITCHES. >:3
hmm
never heard of that before
We get taxed for pretty much everything
Our fuel is mostly tax
12LOOL

Greek mythology right there
12dark is what happens when it becomes nighttime or the sun gets blocked from it
Oedipus complex?
...
14Stuff MIGHT happen though :o
oi freakin greeks
Yeah, that's very Greek Mythology like
12just like white is a color and light is when something becomes illuminated

12mini-colors
We have to make all the characters corrupt so it can be like real mythology
12you're kind of changing the topic
hi
hello
12not really
12I know what I said isn't relevant
12well it is
:O
or not
12because shades=darkening=dark
12the fact still remains is white and black are visual things
12and dark and light are differed by how illuminated it is
yeah he died
Okay, nubs.
now I'm bugging him on facebook to get on here again hahahahah
yay
Meow
12you have officially confuzzled me o3o;

14inb4 orgy :P
But in PM?
12who said white?
/me shot
LOL
/me hides
12I fail at this crap
and btw, Greek Mythology isn't exactly a soap opera
12So yeah
12xD
12maybe like 1 or 2 people
LOLz
Azure
12but people were giving way off answers though
It's so very similar though
noooo it's not really greek mythology related :P
Just say what he wants
12like purple and pink
/me runs
12xDDD
14XD
12LOL
....and drags him by his chariot?
12the sun is a pwetty pwetty pink~
/me shot
12lol
A much more funny question to ask would be "What colour is a hydrogen bomb?" :P
Memoserv
12o.o
It's actually a service here
lol wut
12that doesn't make sense
12typical... *eye roll*
Which one is the wise old man?
12a hydrogen bomb is whatever color you paint it
12XD
Oh, right
He just sits in his cave of services all day
Haha\
giving bot-like wisdom to the others
/me eye-rolls more
Correction: "What colour is a hydrogen bomb, when exploding?" :P
12that is better
12however
It's true :o
/me runs
12lolz
it's a pretty epic story
12"What color is the explosion of a hydrogen bomb?" is better yet
sure seems like it
12XD
I seriously plan to write it into a little fanfiction :P
Holy shiz.
mhm?
12What color is a whiteboard painted black?
The point is, to create a question that will result in hilariously off answers though. :P
It's been a little while.
/me flees
yes, it has.
THE TRIO IS REUNITED *epic_music*
12well your wording is still silly
12because even though its exploding
LOL
12the bomb itself is still whatever color you painted it XD
huh
XD
oh lol
XD
Except for the fact that in the middle of exploding, most of the bomb will have already been converted to a highly energetic plasma, so the colour of the casing is/was irrelevant.
ARGH
12it's kind of like making an extra credit question "the teacher is currently holding her hands behind her back, how many fingers is she holding up?"
bright ass screen
12lol
12wb drf o3o
14I'll only continue if Azure doesn't mind ^^

I must have been thinking of whatever you had before this new thing
wat
brb
I might have to edit the mibbit thing when/if that webchat thing gets put up
12kay
?
12also:
12note this:
12the Cowry shell is a symbol of womanhood o3o
12so like: yah
\o/
Just being obnoxious.
I wish there were other IRC clients out there that let me make a widget that links to here
12and a sword is... o3o
12wb
there was a page on the website with a widget like that
But I forgot the URL
12XD
12Wb
Haha, you're not obnoxious though
And if I remember correctly it's not completely ready yet?
12lolz
hmm
Well... I suppose it's ready enough if people want to use it
sure i am... in a nonsensical sort of way
I would like to test it out?
I can have something like http://dev.webchat.epic-chat.net for developers stuff
It's actually my favorite sentence in a book by Robert Cormier.
So that I can improve on it without bringing down the house
LOL, I love how everyone I used to go to school with seems to think that I'm lonely alot
I read one of his books once for school
/me has one more thing to do and it'll be good :)
I did not like it lol
Which one?
Umm
will there be a silly user limit?
We all Fall Down
That's what I need to determine
Oh, that was decent.
like, mibbit I think limits the free widgets to 20 or so users
12well
12like derp derp
My dad introduced me to him, and now I Am The Cheese is arguably my favorite novel.
he tries to hard to sound like a teenager if you ask me
brb, gonna eat
30 I think is an acceptable number
He wrote that one when he was in his 30s, I think.
*@0s
*20s
because, it is not likely you are gonna get 30 active users at any one time
Wait, no, I'm mixing it up with another.
so only that many users can be using the widget to be on the channel?
brb, there's a bird in my garage
O.o
lol
Lol
k
though I would like to see a widget that does not include people who use their own clients in that limit
yeah, that's what I was curious about, if other clients were included in the user limit
Mrow
[censored]roaches.
*people using other clients
12Laa?

The script has a limit of 30
Well, wait
does the script limit include external client users?
12:D
No
12wb
:)
The network limit is about 200
so what happens if there are 30 people in the channel and only one is using the widget? Can another user join?
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff :(
wait, this network is limited to just a meager 200?
At the moment
I mean, the script itself has a limit of 30. No more than 30 people can use the client at once.
ah, okay
how does the client know who isusing it?
and will there be issues with people in various channels using the same client?
More specifically, no more than 30 people can connect to the network using that script
ouch
I can always increase the limit
ah
but there is no per channel basis?
Correct :)
:(
so still stuck with shoddy mibbit
:O I has puppies on mah bed!
let the battle for bedspace commence!
Why stuck with mibbit?
Why do you need a channel limit?
no your client has a scrpt user limit, is what you make it sound like.
sounds like at most 30 people in the entire world can use that script
for any channel
not just 1
bustin open the door
Let me put it another way
tell her beast boy say hello
wat.
and Lambduh
You're not going to run into any problems with the user limit for the webchat
and I can direct this webchat widget to direct my members to a specific channel?
Yes
hmm
LINKY!
hows the lag>
well I named my precious kitten from warriors lol
?

http://webchat.epic-chat.net/?channels=YOUR_CHANNEL_HERE

but with my first girlfriend I did all the time
2and the letter Q
Hmm, I should probably shave...it's been four days and I have a beard o_O
immediately after my first date with her actually
I had considered breaking up with her, but, I honestly fear she will kill herself if I do
2thanks for watching barney the prehistoric lizzar
or fail school
Let's see if sleep will find me. 'Night, everyone.
both of which are bad
Good luck
cya narc
2He isn't worth the "D"
what do I do?
D:
Baibai.
get her on the pill to make her more bearable?
Well
Stern glare.
LOL
or crawl under a rock and hide for 2 weeks a month?
/me thinks
You fear suiside like seriously
12o.o
nice find
:)
someone today wanted me to help work on a videogame
yes, her psych profile is as such that I am very likely the center of her universe
Woah, really?
2What with the |Zzz
neo from spyrochat
That is bad...BAD
sleep :P
Hmm
brb
And you have no intrest in her now
it's reallllly bad for anyone to think that way
It is
For one person to be the center of their universe
I do, but i am fearing for my own sanity
Neo?
No, she's literally saying "zzz"
She is insane how
03o.o
mr apple fruit
Fearing for your own sanity?
Oh, him
apperently he is working on a videogame
didn't know he made video games...
o.O
ZEE ZEE ZEE
about once a week she gets all emotional because she wants to see me, but something comes up and so we have to delay seeing each other a bit longer
/me 2feels alone
2hi rp4l
03O.o
5Hi guys.
2how is?
12O.o
5Oh, okay.
12o.O
^-^
12:3
Ah, and she takes it too hard?
so about once a week, I am pulled between acting to be with her, and doing things logically
2good :)
5I just went to see Iron Man 2. It was all right.
yeah
2Sock puppet
id like to know how to make 3d stuff but i dont have the patients nor money
2that is so good
7O3o
2I loved War Machine
I saw it a month ago
03only alright?
SO did I
03I thought it was awesome
but all i know is that it is similar to sculpting i guess
5Really DRF?
03yes
5I thought it was predictable. =/
This is bad ass, must point out
I had to see it when I saw war machine in it.
for the past 2 months now I have been trying to work with her on getting her to think about things more
5Didn't quite keep me on my toes like the first one.
Does she understand it isn't your fult that you can't see her?
*fault
5I thought the basic premise was very "meh".
12o.o
honestly, I am not sure
2it was still an awesome movie
5I mean, of course if you have a weapon like that it's going to be exploited and of course Iron Man is going to save the day by the end.
Pichu - my first IRC bot `O'
every now and then I hear the "you are blowing me off"statement
Then that convinces her you are out uh...ya know
so you zap and it hurts you
/me is paranoid...bad
5But at least Robert Downey Jr. and what's-his-face (the Lt. Col.) were very good.
5And of course Scarlett Johansen shone.
2oh yeah
Or she thinks you are really blowing her off
03chibiz.
12XD
It's called being emo ;~;
12Indeed o:
hehe, I honestly am the best guy in the world, when it comes to relationships. If she leaves me for another man, I would be happy with that, as long as it is because he is able to make her happy better than I did
I mean, why try to be selfish?
lol
anyways, yeah, also, tonight she was complaining of some serious symptoms like difficulty breathing, stomach pains, and headaches, but refused to inform her parents of it
Wait
Qui
Hmm
which worries me because she has Celiacs disease
Why did she refuse to tell them?
if it's personal I understand, you don't have to say
"because they dont care about her"
how could pain be personal?
no idea
maybe some problem with her parents is
that's what I was implying
/me noms someone
eh, not really. just the standard over bearing catholic parents
but yeah, her parents should at least care enough to help her when she's in pain
=/
«Annual» I have those kind of parents
/me o.o's
What is celiac's disease
well, they might be reluctant to believe her, seeing as how she drove out to my place despite them telling her no
?
:E
12:3
basically, if she has any food with wheat or gluten, she can die
Oh wow
/me huggles Azure
/me meeps
/me huggles back X3
5I just realized something. I had an epiphany. Eureka. Et cetera, et cetera.
|3
/me is currently obsessed with drawing chibis
12o.o
/me facepalms himself
/me random
Lolwat
this would be so much easier if I could find a suitable replacement to take my place
12http://oekaki.ambernova.net/
12that
12look
12XD
but she will never leave me for anyone else
12CHIBIS
03oh wow
03my mom blew a fuse with her hair dryer
03the one my computer's on
12|D
03luckily I have a battery backup
not that I want to break up with her, I just feel I might have to, in an effort to protect myself
5xD Wow.
12xDD
5Well, even though no one asked I'll tell anyways: My epiphany is that
HO-LY-CRAAAAAAAP
AZRE
5EVER.
*AZURE
/me 5headdesks repeatedly
THAT PIC
OF YOU
/me pokes kyu
AWESOME
12I'M TOO LAZY TO FINISH IT
12LOL
I think I know you from somewhere else...
12BUT THANKS
Or from someone else
I don't even know what to say, I can see it both ways
2lol
/me tugs kyu's tail
No prob XD
12XD
Could try to help her be more healthy about the relationship
which would be really hard
How do you do that oÎ”o
12gosh darnit blasted
Yay, I have finally figured out how to get my minicomputer to not smell like a hippy! (Hint: Turpentine + Lysol + Isopropyl Alcohol)
or could do the even harder choice that you're suggesting
12I dunno
12D:
:<
12It just happens!
12xD
Lul
How can I help her be more healthy about this?
12X3
12i don't know if it's just me
(Unfortunately, now it smells like turpentine, rubbing alcohol and Lysol... but at least it's better then the hippy smell... though I think if I lit a match the computer may spontaneously combust.)
My grandma has a friend who falls asleep whenever she eats wheat productsd.
12but i don't like finding wood ticks in my bed
Whee new episode of K-On was awesome XD
5Yuck! D:
By telling her how unhealthy it is that she looks at you as the center of the world
O__o;;
5Maybe you should... spray for wood ticks?
tell her that there is way more to life that she needs to give herself time for
12i don't have a specific spray for wood ticks
5... Um...
but the reason she looks at me as the center is because of her disease, she has very few friends, and none close by that she can hang out with and get out of the house with on a whim
5Go to Canfield's (or wherever) and get one! o3o
12this is the first time it's happened
and she cant really do normal everyday things, as those involve eating out or snacks, which her choices are severely limited
I hate to make this suggestion
But I seriously think you two might want to talk to someone about this
Like someone professional
5By the way I have a random question: Have any of you ever encountered someone who maybe isn't a real great writer/artist/whatever and yet gets INSANELY POPULAR and the WHINES about it?! Good gawd. One of my dA friends got that way and then they complain about art thieves and stuff and it's like... chill dude! ><
You can talk to me.
Oh.. professional.
5(Okay end rant. xD;;; I really needed to get that out of my system.)
lol
12hmm
That's a good idea
2lol
12i'm using a spray for spiders and roaches
I think it would really help the both of you
12but i have no idea if it'll have any effect on ticks
2so kinda like Leonardo DeCaprio
2*runs*
I cant imagine that going over well: Hey, I think you are BatS@!t insane and so we need to see a couples shrink
I know a lot of people don't like the idea of therapists but they can actually be really helpful if you can find a good one
well you don't have to put it like that
5I'm just really annoyed because he got popular for god-knows-what-reason and now he whines about stuff and everyone comes to his rescue and is like "OH BAWWW YOUR LIFE IS SO HORRIBLE HERE LET ME MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER FOR YOU". I mean, he's still my friend and all but gosh! I wish he would leave the drama with the llamas.
5(Okay, NOW end rant.)
2oh, you mean that guy who wassaying he could not go on?
Have the voices gone away yet?
2yeah, I think I got that journal as well
besides, I am on a part timers wage, and so cant afford the massive therapy costs
5What?
5Oh, no, not him. ^__^;;;
5This is another friend. One I actually know somewhat.
2oh
5I actually don't know the guy you were talking about so well... but yeah I did see that journal.

I set my flags so I enter voiced, but that didnt work correctly
... ya about that

...
Yeah theres spam control, its usually a ban though.
Hahahaha
Umm
Usually?
Why not in this case?
lol
I dont know, im not the one who kicked him.
"It's not a spam, it's a 'd'"
exactly!
NO
MY FRIEND
DONT LEAVE ME
XD
"Spam control" lol
Yes, but only for you
!op
see
Oh, only for people who have access in here
Thats what I thought
!flags
=/
O.o
I want control over my people in a staff channel while appearing below them
12i should consider myself lucky
12i just learned that lime disease is caused by a bacterial infection
hm?
12XDDD
12i take Amoxicillin 2 times a day for acne
So I see
12and i have for months
No im not.
If you want to fine-tune the settings with more detail than /cs aop/sop/hop/vop, you'll want to read up on the flags command
/cs help flags
5Oh man!
5I take Amoxicillin.. when I get sick.. but that's all.
That's terrible
Just really laggy.
wb?
wow
5You really need to find a way to get rid of those ticks. D:
that was retarded.
I've never had a problem with ticks
but that's just me
hi
yo my man.
back so soon?
lol
ARRRGGG
Hahaha
stop kicking him
Why?
Why so friendly to him SR?
Because I said so!
he an aquantaince?
Some troll buddy of yours?
Because I want to mess with him.
ello!
XD
lol
Btw glac, I need to know the sever location for your shoddy setup.
=/
he gave up, lol
nevermind
I didn't think I was protected anymore to begin with
hey
hi
stop
She has no voice...
stop!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah! I know right?
please stop banning me!!!!
OK!
just kicking actually
banning wouldn't even let you back
Hahaha!
ya i know
Er
He could just take my op status
remember I used to have admin
kind of thought that when he banned me like 15 times!!!!
so whats up please_stop
*she
yeah Im too lazy to put protect back on though
theres no pointin it anyways
oh im gonna change ma name
Nah I'm not complaining
/nick newname
it's faster
12i shut off my shoddybattle server
k
oh
12peopled like Pokemon Online more
just wondering
lol
oh pff oops
12ever heard of "is it a good idea to microwave this?"
well, I meant to put the new name there
XD
12if you want i can direct you to pokemon online
12it's a lot like shoddybattle
i know
everyone gets that wrong
12except it has more visual features
should've been more clear I guess
5I've seen some of those vids. xD
should have said /nick melons
I know what it's like. I was just wondering if it was still up or if it was the offocial TST shoody server
/nick retard
Hahaha
12nah
Either of those
5They're almost as good as "Will It Blend"?
12i doubt articuno would let me host something like that
:P
12i killed the tick by flushing it down the toilet
12but what i really should of done
12was put it in the microwave and videotape it XD
and about the microwave thing, I've only seen youtube videos. Now will it blend I'm familiar with
12and send it to those guys
well if he comes to any other channels and does this, I'll have my first excuse to use my oper rights
permissions, not rights.
Same thing
Not gline, just kill
ya well just dont kik me again
we dont use kill.
12or mail it to them and let them take care of it XD
dont spam cause it annoys people
5You should!
ya i know
ha
12they say you kill a tick by flushing it down the toilet
yeah buddy don't do your big D spasm again
12or by setting it on fire
It was really frustrating
tinychat is empty:(
12but what about microwaving it? XD
why don't we use kill?
A friend of mine made a parody of "Let it Blend" once...
And the result was awesome. :P
.........
sounds lovely
Well that's the point
cause last time you used kill you killed an umbreon
"Will vodka and vermouth blend?" *whirr* *drink* "Yes, and the result is a semi-good vodka martini."
:O
12i named a pokemon deck Martini once
so what are we even talking about here
pokemon aren't suposed to die
?
Someone spames, you channel ban
No, the point is to ban.
If they do it in another channel, kill as a warning
so we arguin about spam.........
OK, you're annoying me now
/me laughs with a lack of enthusiasm
No, but about how to treat spammers
they are arguing about terminology
ha ha ha :/
12it was Giratina with Luxray Lv. X
12and techs
I dunno
12luxray up their claydol
.......
12and spread around it

12my friend got an ipod touch
and the awful grammar and annoying questions aren't helping
03o.o.
ok let me use proper grammer to please your needs than.
bigchat is huge though!
You do that
That whole "d" thing wasn't really a good start dude
Yeah, if you wanted to annoy people, you did a great job
:( but I was just getting comfortable with being heard on a mic
fine i will remove my d button.
LOL
don't you all just love trolls?
I like this guy.
Hes funny.
Lol
He sucks
Let's get rid of him
Something about him makes me think of a wannabe channer...

Okay now I'm back
True

Hehehe, I prove a rule wrong!

He thinks it was "revenge" for a slipup he made in another channel
it wasn't on the channel
He messaged me on gmail
then either went offline or blocked me
are you serious
why will no one els etalk then
*else *talk
i have this wierd feeling
something in the back of my head
its talking
I don't get it
it kinda sounds like
no it coulnt
I do: He's just being really emotional
but then again
and it'll get better with time
He said in another channel that I "spent a lot of time in therapy" and asked if the voices had stopped yet
its alot like
"d" : )
All the while making jokes about someone who's girlfriend is possibly suicidal
huh?
And underage drinking is out of line?
its telling me to do something
When it was a joke?
hmm what could it be
something like
and nobody's life was at stake in your case
"spam"
it couldnt be
never
who gets offended at underage drinking besides parents
Apparently SR
SR apparently
but the voice is getting louder
and louder
and the only way i can stop it
I haven't seen him get emotional like that in a really long time
is if
it's strange

Yes ma'am?
Do you have SR on Gmail by any chance?

because they are probably busy.

i think ill just sit and watch ok
wait till somone talks
Yeah, it's not like he'll stay mad over something like this either
unless you want me to leve?
oi... this guy is a freak...
I don't know
You can never tell with him
blocking seems like pretty permanent action
It's really easy to undo
well no one cares so watching starts.................................now
just take the name off the list
well yeah
If he's going to stay mad over something like this then that's his loss
he's not getting th chance to talk to one of his friends over something this stupid
trust me, I've been in both your shoes and his coutless times before
it will get better
I promise :)
yeah just dont let it eat at you
watching is more boring than it looks...
exactly
that only makes it worse
I always do that
I always let it bug me too much

12lol
so thats how he knows
i wonder if thats a wig or her hair
and all those piercings are kinda grossing me out...
wait.. thats her hair
or maybe it's a giant pink cat
I watched like two seconds and turned it off
xD
She's kinda adorable in a strange, skanky way xD
just not in the video
the pink lady?
errr, I dunno
hmm... she hangs out with a gothy girl and a fruit as well..
alright.. thats enough of that..
hi
hi
Oh god
that annoying kid is in the main channel of this server now
hm?
what main channel
#epic-chat
does anyone know how to get unbanned
And he's asking how to get unbanned
XD
Oh, he quit
from where?
YO just lost the ruler
so he goes to #epic-chat and asks how to get unbanned
it said kicked
right before that she set +b
that means ban
hey
hey
just missed him
see what i mean?
He's in #help
wow
he is sure desperate
I'm pretty sure this guy's a troll
did you see the crap he put on spyrochat..
Me too
hes like 7
eh, I've seen trolls act like that
they just want to [censored] people off
why arent they talking!
they don't care how
:o
who wants to bet SR will unban him just to [censored] me off
eh, I dunno
he hasn't yet
and it's been a while now
If he's still keeping this up tomorrow I'm going to contact him
I wonder if something is wrong for him to act this strange
I bet there is
and it's affecting his perceptions of everything else
yeah just wait a bit and things may be different tomarrow
see what i mean?
06you know, I love surprises and all....but I hate the fact that I know a surprise is coming, but I don't know what the heck it is...
12darnit
12i'm too afraid to get covered up tonighter
06o-o;?
12*tonight
12hi Aurora
06fff well
06guess I'll download skype now
06seeing as I got an invite in my email lol
12Aurora let's just say i had a surprise of my own earlier today
06o-o......?
I don't know D:
12i found a stupid wood tick in my bed
12while i was in bed
06.....EW
06I had a sleepover at my best friend's friday night
06I woke up breifly with a spider crawling on my arm
12i've had that happen before
:)
12i'm afraid of spiders as well
:3
06I saw it, flipped my arm over and smooshed it to the carpet, and went back to sleep
06I didn't kill it, cuz it was gone in the morning, but it was there
O:
12we get plenty of spiders in this area
12it's a rural area
12-.-
:)
/me joins in
:)
:)
:)
:O
Join the group hug Infamous
(R)
lol
don't worry he's going to ping later
({)
Hmm
.lsan03.sbcglobal.net) vs. .skt2ca.sbcglobal.net)
they just both have sbc
maybe
through comcast?
er compaq
sbcglobal
instead of mibbit
Nah, it's their ISP
probably a coincidence
like mine is mwt
But I almost wonder if we're about to be attacked by trolls again
Woah
I suspected that too
as soon as I saw the 1337 name that's what I assumed
let them troll in the abyss
no one is basically there anyway
/me waves
Hello
hii :)
06facebook group "if you complain about your 3.9 gpa again, I'll punch you in the face"
06lol
12still though Aurora
03XD @ that
like this guy acts dumb, but he seems to know his way around irc
03I'm proud of my 2.0
/me runs
12i don't feel like getting bit by a wood tick or a spider
yeah, he found all the channels
12i'd rather get bit by a spider than a wood tick though, most spiders aren't poisonous
Remember he posted those /quote commands
and he sayed "/guote"
yep
lol sayed
*said
12i'm sure drf has seen the mythbusters episode when they let themselves get bit by daddy long legs XD
and when he went onto epic chat he wasn't using Mibbit anymore
03no I haven't oi.o
03-i
Oh yeah
12you haven't lawl
I didn't catch that
06bree
How would he have found it?
06I'm kinda scared to get in my bed now
12they were testing the myth that the daddy long leg was the most toxic spider
06even though I know we don't have woo ticks
06wood
There's no link to it anywhere on the site that I know of
06it's poisonous
06but can't break our skin
Maybe he knows how to find the website map
12actually mythbusters thought otherwise
06and it's not the most venomous- what
12it just barely is long enough to break the skin
oh lovely, now he's PMing me
06I swear I've seen studies saying it cant
whats up?
I love talking to irritating trolls
If so he probably just googled IRC
Haha, like O
12they took a daddy long leg and measured it's fangs XD
O isn't a troll
and so many others
12then compared it to the thickness of skin
hes just dumb
true, he's just noobish
*he's
04ffff
12it barely breaks through aparently
12one of them let themselves get bitten by a daddy long leg though
no
nothing much
waaaait
04heya
12it causes a small burning sensation but vanishes after like 2 seconds
a crazy troll was here earlier
O.O
Plot twist!
ah, happens I guess..
/me opens chatlogs
did you ever whois her?
I might have
But I'll have her information from when she signed in or left
oh yeah, true
and I have a conversation with her saved, so...
it's too bad /whowas doesn't go that far back
yeah
how far back does it go?
I don't know
o-o
hi
04hello
found her yet?
XD
Oh yeah
totally different
Different than this guy
never mind
buckeye... so shes from ohio
I had just found it right when you asked that
I had to find the point when she quit
pretty funny actually
Because she's a troll
It was completely random from what I could tell\
oh yeah
And trolls know how to annoy people
so to annoy us all
especially him
it's like she detected his weakness
and boom
were there any other trolls this guy might be?
I can't think of any
maybe this was all an elaborate joke by SR to make me feel like [censored]
the host is completely different
could be his friend
It's really suspicious that this guy knows about the webchat
I don't see what motive he'd have for that
When pretty much no one does
look at the quit message
/me recently updated the website so that webchat is listed more often
yep
and the default channel is epic-chat
so...
the first one he went to
I'm kinda bad at small talk soo dunno what to start out with
he does seem to know what he's doing with IRC thoug
*though
I'll give him that
the other thing that gets me is the /quote commands
yeah, that threw me off too
I don't even know what that does and I've been here since December
06BREEEEE
06you need to fight in the dragon rp, not just make my characters sound stupid D=
/me runs
o_0_o
lol
I'd better go to bed
yeah, me too actually
or I won't be able to get up tomorrow
Good night
04lol
for payday
:D
Night
/me pokes 591's central eye
cya
oh that's not my eye
night Infamous
cya
you work tomorrow too, right?
yeah
that's Harry's eye :D
sounds like something from a boss battle: "POKE the central eye to stun it, and then quickly strike the monster!"
the first day when the entire Walmart crew of epic-chat is all working
04lol
sounds like baking a pie
ha
yeah..
wait wat
not at the same time though
04Reminds me of the Helmasaur King from TLoZ ALttP
thank goodness for me
next week ill be in disney world though
lol, nope
06let there be purple
04lol
for me too
i dont know if ill be on but ill try
06IT'S POIPLE 8D
/me burples
/me shot
I work the day tomorrow still
youll be in disney world?
nah
:P
06POIPLE FOR POIPLENESS
03o.o
06you heard right, drf
did they have you work during morning shift your first three days?
no just the first day on orientation
06A VOTE FOR POIPLE IS A VOTE FOR SOMETHING UTTERLY RANDOM THAT YOU WILL SIT IN A SUSPENSEFUL TERROR AND SLOWLY BE PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE
hm, I wonder why they're making me do that
06AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAAAA
maybe the secnond to finish the cbls
06AND THEN A PICKLE EATS YO FACE, FOOL
ah well, I can't complain
ugh
06yeah, I went there
CBLs
04[/insertspammymessagehere]
06i thought it was a banana that did it
I had enough of them for the two hours today I did them
just two hours?
/me confers with the script writer
that's all that was left after orientation
and then I'll do the rest tomorroe
second day i had to do most of them
06neither of us wins! it shall be a coconut
*tomorrow
did it take all day?
They warned me it might
ask if you get your paycheck today
/me hits lyon with a coconut
They already said I don't
:(
I wish I did lol
/me eats it
oh yeah.. about the pay check... every other saturday at 11:59 the paychecks are finalized and a new one is started
if they go out on Thursdays, how are they finalized on Saturday?
12who wants to turn base metals into GOLD?! 8D
so if you ad an absence on saturday then it would count on both paychecks
*had
06Alchemists with funny hair?
so you receive the check frm the last Saturday?
no the pay period starts on sunday
12good answer, 50....no probably 78% correct
04my nan?
SHORT alchemists with funny hair?
/me shot
12i said nothing of fullmetal >:U
the last minute of every other saturday is when the check is finalized
Oh okay, I think I get it
then a new one is started
:3
okay, that makes sense
12now if only alphonse knew how to make a transutation circle just by clapping his hands
12*transmutation
its sort of a pain in the ass when you have a time clock error on that day
They told me to expect that tomorrow actually
they were having problems getting my schedule into it
be sure to punch in punchout for lunch punch in from back from lunch and then punch out
yeah
oi
oh yeah annother thing
hm?
you have to be at walmart for at least 6 months to be eligible for their bonuses
either 6 moths or a year
*months
yeah, they said that too
and the 10% discount I get in the mail 90 days from now
you part time or full time
full
12o_0
dam
yeah
im still part time
my only free days are wednesday and thursday
thats sorta odd
and saturday the first week
but only the first week for some reason
to get me used to the switch from day to night shift I assume
dont think they did that for me but oh well
lol, or maybe they just have enough employess working Saturday already or something
I overheard them say that a lot of people are leaving in the next couple weeks
aka quitting
probably vacation
oh
yeah, the guy who gave me the safety tour was on his second to last day before quitting
actually, he was probably retiring
he was an older guy
hope he wasnt a [censored]ey mouse
hahaha
nope
he was pretty cool
i got a few people at mine that are pretty funny
makes the break pretty enjoyable
ugh, breaks are gonna be the worst once I start nights
unless my mom lets me borrow her phone
That's a good idea actually
sometimes someone brings a gamboy annother brings a book ect
I do enjoy drawing and I don't do it enough
me too
lol, my DS was my backup plan for if my mom decides to keep her phone at home
in fact i procrastinated the whole day as i wanted to practive drawing
*practice
never got around to it I'm guessing?
eh.. i cuold have
i did do something during that huge bout of silence a while ago but that was anatomy practice
anatomy practice?
:3
drawing the human body in the right proportions
ah
I need to do that
I suck at drawing humans
:3<--}
i'm alright but i hate drawing digits
digits I can do
it's the waist and chest I can't draw
and faces
I can't draw faces
I got lucky that that Link one turned out

I remember watching The Omen at that date
i shat brix
that they all are shadowy and some even demon-ish

14XD
But yeah
It was funny.
omegle
there was a variation with mudkips
trolls trolling trolls
forever
Most of the people on there are just looking for cybering partners, I think
Mostly they always say 'asl'
to which I respond slowpoke
oh, always when I go on it ends up as trolls trolling trolls.
there's a habbo raid tool that's great for omegle
in general if i see there's over 2000 people online i think "oh 4chan is on here" at least last time i were on
actually I think it averages around 7000 or so
lol wut
then it must have changed since last i went on
xD
Peak hours
timezones?
i guess everyone except other europepplz are asleep when i usually go on
Like, when it's 4 Pm in cali
which is during boring school filler
at least i used to.
then it got boring
I never sleep 8D
once on omegle video though
first thing i saw
i like chatroulette better
oh
yes that's better indeed
but i've met wannabee goatse's on both
well at least when the other person isn't a recorded video

Ooh, CS5 is out.
And it costs $2500.
<censored> that lol
I liked CS4.
14Honestly, who would pay that much for a bit of software :|
You downloaded their free trial, and changed one .dll, only 2.4MB big, and you got it free permenantly.
permanently*
14I don't use CS so
14I don't really care much XD
14but the price for CS5 is ridiculous
14And they wonder why everyone torrents it
148D
The changes to Flash CS5 are quite boring.
The only thing they did was make it able to create applications for Ipod touches, really.
14oh yay lets celebrate </sarcasm>

14The only thing I'm good at baking is flapjacks XD
Use the entire egg, whites are used for specific things
12What specific things? I am trying to make cupcakes :3
Though, may I ask why you are baking a cake...? lol
12Bake off at work tomorrow!
06hmm
12The winner gets four hours off!!!
06I think the full thing would be better for cupcakes
Specific things like lemon marang *pokes sp* cakes and stuff... lol
06LOL @ THAT PRIZE
06that's the most awesome work contest ever
14LOL epic prize
can't remember well ^^' But I have rarely seen only whites being used in recipes
12Why are eggs whites better for lemon meranges and not cupcakes?
12Oh ok
12Aurora, it has to be world cup themed as well :3 since the game is tomorrow!
because of the top part, you know, the white part? XD
12Oh

Lol
hi you
How are you
4Guy is the biggest [censored] ever lmao
Lol, "but you whatever you are", haha he's strange.
"Now leave my page and never return!" Rofl.
Can you explain why he considers wyverns as evil?
12What?
Another crazy dA inhabitant
How can you consider any mythical creature to be evil?
4I dunno
They're not real, they're what you make them.
4he's just being a derp
4AHAHAHAHA
4he blocked me
06ra
Hmm
4*goes to other account*
Thought my phone failed then lol
How about something mythical composed of evil, like a Ring Wraith, for example. They're fictional, but considered evil, even by the villains in TLOTR.
You should counter his argument by saying unicorns are evil. Why does he think wyverns are evil?
07o3o
4I dunno
o3o
o3o
It doesn't mean they can't be good.
12This conversation is hilarious.
I always thought they were good, helpingthat nice mr sauron find his ring again
07o3o
brb
Dari: I understand, it's just that there's no basis in there that they are "good", even though morality would be a point of view. In fiction, it isn't always.
4pft
4he blocked me again
/me dies
He didn't give a crap about them.
XD
But they were still helping him...such nice people :)
In that book, in that context you could consider them to be evil, the point is that you can change the context they're in to whatever you want it to be.
But that's just it, you can't look outside because the context can't change, or it becomes non-canon.
wth does that mean?
That's a defining part of literature, that it doesn't change no matter what other people think about it. :P
Not what other people think about it.
Sure, you can say they're good, and write about them as being good, but it doesn't affect the actual work.
That's all I'm saying.
"Then the Ring Wraith gave the little girl her lost toy back, her being the fifth child he'd helped that day"
There, context changed.
No. xD
Aww, Ring Wraiths are so kind, and helpful.
I think the ring wraithes should be declared unsung heroes of justice!
I've put in a vlaid argument, and have nothing more to say, lol.
*valid
So have I.
Context BS.
Me too :D
Besides, I have the super-scientific thoery of stuff to back me up.
*theory
If I say drug lords are evil, that's harder to argue against, because the context they are in is fixed.
There, in real life, the context can change.
Not in a fixed work, like in literature.
Drug lords are real people?
07lol
07bignose o3o
06yeah I was being fast about it
Name one and I'll tell you.
Drug lords are a force of good, they creat jobs for the unemployed!
Rodriguez the Benevolant
If in real life, a man killed 10 people, I wouldn't say "He's such a good man", if a man is described in a book as killing 10 people, I can take that character out of the story, and put them into another context, where you could decribe them as good.
They also toppled the Mexican government, but we'll ignore that for now. :P
06lol facebook groups
Nooo, you can't ignore it, address it!
06er
06*status
06"you know you're a college student when your family bribes you with costco toilet paper"
That's differen.t
That's different.*
Mornin
That's the interpretation of a context.
Evening
Exactly, which I agree with.
Regardless of what you think, if he did that in real life, the context is fixed, you can't just say "No, he didn't do that".
The only thing is, you'd need to know whether that was a real event or a fictional occurence.
They're both entirely different.
fresh pad i have no [censored]ing clue what you just said lol
Now you're talking about fictional context for a real person?
Drug lords are forces of good!
06ok, gonna grab a bite, and then sit down and spam up the job applications
Benevolant means good
In a round-about way
Real life is more complex, you might not know for sure whether the context is fiction, or not, but in a fiction book you know it's not real.
You're restating my point, Dari.
Notice the statment at the end.
If you know it's not real in a fiction book, you can take it out of its context.
I still agree.
Because the other context it is in is not real.
All I'm saying that, even though fiction is written by people with bias, it can still be exempt from a moral perspective.
Real life is all perspective, I never disagreed with that.
Good and evil are similar in their own right, though the world makes them out to be opposites.
Good and evil are learned perspectives.
Right.
Which brings us to philosophy, I guess.
I might not be able to say that Ring Wraiths are good in the context of LotR, but in the context of what I wrote earlier, I could.
Ultimately there's no such thing.
Yeah, but that context would have no ground, since they are depicted as evil incarnate in the books. That means there's no basis for making them out to be good.
The books, and what I wrote are separate contexts, the books have nothing to do with my context.
:P
I know. But if there's no evidence of that in them, how can you righfully (or otherwise) present them as that? It just doesn't make sense.
How can one fictional context have more relevance than another? Many writers make out dragons to be good, and many evil? Who is to say that one is more correct than another?
I am to say
IF YOU CAME AROUND ENOUGH YOU'D BE LIKE A GOD TO US LIKE A DRUG DEALEEEER
None are correct, since dragons don't exist.
It's impossible to know.
Nor do Ring Wraiths?
I'm aware.
You dont exist!
Which means I can put them in either context.
So are you good or evil?!
But Ring Wraiths were exclusively made up in LOTR, as far as I know.
Yeah, but everything is based on something, and I'm sure there's an original account of dragons somewhere.
Dragons exist in actual lore, and at least bear some resemblance to donosaurs.
*dinosaurs
donosaurs!
There still has to be a first mention of them, when the idea was conceived.
Exactly. The only difference is the origin of the work they are mentioned in first.
12I'm bored.
LOTR has a copyright, with a confirmable date. When were dragons first conceived?
Me too
:P
1953
Why does copyright matter?
Because it's law!
I'm just using that as an example, it doesn't.
So you're saying that I cannot create a new context for them simply because we know where they were first mentioned?
YES!
Not rightfully, no.
I have this phone >>
Hate*
He'll sue your ass, Dari, don't do it!
Sure, it's possible, but it wouldn't be accepted as true and itsn't open to interpretation.
Well what does what you said previously have to do with it then?
*isn't
.-.
I don't see the difference.
But LOTR will be just like dragon lore, given it survives that long into the future.
Yeah, he'll have it taken off you, dari
Just as well i'll be home in 10 minutes
Both are fictional, one old, one newer.
LOL
Let the battle begin!
/nick Dari's_Ass
/sc
that sounds so gay hahahhaha
/j #epic-chat
So it is different depending on the time, since it changes the meaning.
Dragons are more public domain, so to speak.
Can I ask a question?
Why does it matter that you cannot legally create an alternative?
06stupid job app
How does law come into it?
I just made a different version of Ring Wraiths.
06I hate how it asks "how did you hear about this position" and doesnt have a "walk in" option
I only brought it in because you won't give up.
xD
06I didnt hear about it, stupids
Otherwise I'd just be repeating myself.
Why are you debating, what was the original argument?
Because I think I'm right?
That's just it, there's an absolute answer to this, and you think there's not.
What?
I think there's an answer to it, and it's mine.
No, it's mine, all mine!
Real life is open to interpretation, but a character limited to a literary realm isn't always so.
It isn't limited to that realm.
03LOL
I made a new realm, where it's good.
03I always just said their website
06yeah that option was hidden...
Yes, it's possible to say they aren't, but you'd be incorrect. There's a difference between having an opinion and being wrong.
03also like
Is that a pun?
/me runs
:P
Yesh! :P
03*over
I'm not wrong.
You are.
No, you're both wrong
06..............wtf did Safeway do to their application process o-o
In the eyes of someone who shares my opinion, I'm not, so hopefully we're not living in a storyboard.
Well, in my eyes, I'm right.
You don't have to think I am, but I want to.
That'd be the purpose of this argument, then, even though even if everyone in the world agreed with me that wouldn't make any of us right.
Ring wraiths are exclusive to lord of the rings, in which they are the corrupted hearts of men, in otherwords, evil. Taking them out of context and making them good isn't cannon so therefore negligable.
^ You're on the right track.
12Sneas :D
Wth is cannon?
Oh, is that where you're confused?
It's a term that used to apply to religious doctrine, meaning a legitimate addition to a story.
It's NOT an addition to a story.
It is an entirely different story, as I said.
Ideas exclusive to one other idea can not be changed. Things that are incorperated into multiple ideas, such as dragons, are open to debate
Nothing to do with LotR.
Nothing at all.
Well then you cant call them ring wraiths, they're something else
We've moved past that already.
Only law says I can't.
And law has nothing to do with this argument.
Azure :3
12:3
Then where would you be creating this alternate wraiths?
If there were no laws to prevent the use of Ring Wraiths in fiction, you would be correct.
In the happy bunny land of happiness.
That's why in the case of dragons and other mythical creatures we are in agreement.
I repeat, laws don't matter.
12Hi :D
14Hey :>
But they do, and their esssential to my whole argument, as it's based in a modern world with laws like this.
/me at work
Oh, then I dont care. You could make all ring wraiths gay leather bound men with moustaches for all I care lol do what you will with them as long as you dont force them onto me
*they're

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fresh: Thanks for the support.
/me kicks it
To put it simply, I'm not going to change what I think, so this is pointless.
And I work at 6am tomorrow
Isn't that the point of a debate, though, to solve a problem and assert an opinion?
12Eww
14D:
12xD
I don't care if I change your mind, but I'm going to support my view.
WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU SOLVING?!
A problem that evidently has absorbed us three enough to debate on for the past twenty minutes or more.
Which has also been absorbed by nothingness because I cant remember this problem.
Alright then. Now we're back where we started.
:P
Indeed
Nothing lost, nothing gained.

Other than a better understanding of our respective sides.
Lol.

In some circles "he" is referred to as 'it' or 'she'.

England vs USA on saturday though
You guys realize you're stranded on an island, right?
so?
/me is bench pressed :C
What's the definition of an island? Surely you are too, if it's just "land surrounded by a body of water".
I just think it's funny to look at it that way.
That's waht I was thinking, Dari
Then what are continents, if that's the only attribute of an island?
/me hopes he doesn't morph :O
And we're not exactly stranded lol
!lag
-.-
You will be, once the plan is realized.
A continent is surrounded by water
That's my point.
As are islands
Your island is just bigger
if it goes meow then don't complain
But it's size that defines an island, correct?
God, I do feel sorry for you.
14Yeh, I'm hoping he doesn't morph into a shadow lugia XD
Yes, I do.
Well if it is then england is too big to be an island
/me isn't quite that strong yet
That's why I intend to live underwater someday, so I can be stranded there.
I intend to live on the moon
It's mine, you know
I don't intend to live.
I own it
An isea, water surrounded by land.
You mean a lake?
:P
No.

There's a difference.

06gonna go back to the nursery, gotta find a plumeria tree <3
/me gets squished by shadow lugia D:
06my parents said I could have one ^^
Am "isea" would be like a hole that goes all the way through land to the ocean bottom, and is surrounded by earth.
*an
Then how did it get water in it in the first place?
Also :D Sneas
/me is helped back up
I don't know, it isn't real.
xD
So that means we can swim down to the bottom, and swim out under the land to the sea?
lol
Aww.
Yeah, you go down deep enough and you'll fall from the sky.
14and welcome back Sneas :3
Oh, wait, there's gravity.
lol that sounds awesome
Perpetual gravity
06bye now
14I wanted a work out >:(
You're not gonna get anywhere lifting a tiny cat
/me runs
12o.o
14Fine XD
12XD
If you could negate the earth's mass there would be no gravity...would the earth still orbit the sun?
/me flops on the ground
Negate it in what way?
Counter it so that it doesnt weigh anything
.-.
Then there wouldn't be any real presence of gravity, would there?
Because all mass would have to weigh something, no matter how minute the fraction.
No, we'd jump and never come down, but the sun would still exert a hold on us wouldnt it?
Nope.
Because its gravity isn't strong enough.
But there isn't gravity.
But it's strong enough to move the earth?
14?
Well the sun's gravity isn't strong enough to pull in light, and that has no mass.
You can't make mass weigh nothing without eliminating all gravity, because what is weight but the force exterted on mass by gravity?
Right, I've had enough, not fun anymore
New topic!
Dude, it was just getting good. Notice the beginning there
Hahaha.
Why are african elephants and indian elephants different in terms of their ear sizes?
Environmental adaptions.
The genes for their ears are analogous, right?
12>:
I dunno
14I need something at home that's worthy to bench press
/me ponders his TV
Unless of course we're going to trust in the existence of Pangea.
Do you have an answer?
I believe in Pangea!
Ha, what if it was a mutation, and only the elephants with that mutation (in this case different ear size) went to India, or whichever place had elephants first? That'd be something.
14or my speakers hmm
So do I.
But it's far from proven.
I dont care if it's proven, I believe in it just because you can fit the continents together like a giant puzzle!
Well how do you think england became an 'island'
What
Both do the same thing.
Benchpress TV? LOL
So...We're sinking?
All of the continents are, from what I've read.
Yay!
Yes dari, head for higher ground
Mexico City is sinking 6 inches every year.
But that's because they built it on a marsh. :P
14yeh? why not lol
When we start to sink I'll build a raft out of people
.-.
/me hugs Sneas
melons
See, she's still preoccupied
This is a risky suvject, but if our orbit around the sun narrows at all, we'll have nothing to worry about in terms of a rising sea level.
The heat, however, might kill us. :P
That's why we'll live in fridges
I'm done.
Ha.
Ever watch the Twilight Zone, fresh?
Once or twice
Then the other planets would start hitting on it, thinking it's not married.
lol good one
But anyway, there was one where the whole episode is about Earth having narrowed in its orbit around the Sun, and everyone is dying of thirst.
By the end of the episode you realize the protagonist was dreaming, and the world has in fact moved further from the Sun, and they are freezing to death.
I saw one episode where the sun did a solar flare and this gay thought the other side of the world was dead
OOh, that sounds good, nice twist
guy* not gay
Glad I could spoil it for you.

You have more religious people than non religious people but religion is not allowed to be taught in public schools and yet you created the class of creationism
2but then neither is Hibari =A=
o.o
2wait no nevermind there's an airplane trail
Secularising public schools is more of a way to 1) prevent the majority religion from being taught, since people don't mind *their* religion being taught in school, but hate other people's religions being taught in schools
I dont think any religions should be taught in schools, anywhere
and 2) it's a compromise for all parties. It's not really necessary to religify public schools, cause you have churches and stuff
I remember Spyro22 saying he failed religion as a class because he "wasn't the other religions so it was hard"
Religion is something you should do on your own time
it's like you don't have to believe it you just have to learn it it's not that hard
I could believe in the holy turnip as long as I keep it to myself
Secularizing public schools is not 1) an attempt to rid children of their religion 2) a way to "teach atheism" in schools 3) [insert crazy theory here]
Religion should be disbanded :D
:D
That would make me happy
*teach
^_^
Learning religion is the same as learning theories. Neither are proven, but both are accepted by many people, even the majority.
I can imagine the first day of teaching "Atheism" in religious studies at school....
But they should keep it to themselves
Then should you keep viable theories to yourself, as well?
Atheism was fun in my school, the teacher would feel all uncomfortable lol
I think all religous studies teachers should be atheist
"Atheism is the disbelief in the existance of a god or gods. Now then, finals are tomorrow, and for the rest of the cl[censored] this semester, you can stay home"
That way they'll work solely on fact and wouldnt be biased
Atheism isn't fact.
Whatever, you know what I mean
Yeah.
oooooooo, I know how to counter this argument :D
/me raises hand
PIck me pick me :D
Go ahead.
Okay, so, let's pretend that I told you that there was a tea cup floating in space between Neptune and Uranus
Wait, are we going to go into the kettle thing, too?
You could just tell us instead of pretending
Oh, right xD
Bertrand Russell's kettle. xD
:D
In 2000 years there will be a religion devoted to me, and you all shall be my disciples.
Basically, that demonstrates what I call the "zero evidence fallacy"
If you have a statement that can't be disproven, but has zero evidence to support it, you can treat it as it was disproven
That whole thing is what disproves agnosticism :P
What if the statement is supported by unproven theories?
But what exactly is sufficient evidence is what's being debated.
That and the fulcrum of most religions is faith, the evidence of things not seen.
"evidence of things not seen" <---- so, felt, tasted, heard, mathematically demonstrated?
What would happen if an equal volume of frozen ice and hot water at exactly opposite temperatures were put together in a boal?
Bowl, you mean?
yes
YAY, MONEY :D
Everytime someone tells me the existance of god can be proven, I'm like "show me!" and they're like "well......." and they don't answer or they give me some "just look at the stars at night and you know" emotional crap
I ask religious people awkward questions, like, who mde god?
/me tries to be more serious and academic :P
*archaeological
If they had that sort of proof, they'd be rich by now :P
The fact is, all the evidence is going the wrong way for theism :/
Especially now that science is progressing like it is
Well, it is always conveniently denied of them. Noah's Ark is evidently nestled up on Mt. Ararat, but the Turkish government won't let them in to get a single picture.
?
/me googles
*not called so
What about egyption gods?! They were cooler
Oh, and the greak gods and what not
The Greek gods were so immature.
Which is why they were so awesome!
I don't think it has been definitively proven wrong.
Although there is a lot of considerable problems with organized religion.
*there are
xD
Make sure you correct it, I meant fallible.
I'm NOT saying people are perfect.
Just me :D
Ah, then we could talk, yay!

12i love those games

12the phoenix wright games
Oh, righty

12i mean yeah i agree it's like watching a movie you have to button mash your way through
and finally fixed my computer, I feel so stupid XD
12but the parts you don't do that, it takes a lot of thought to get through
12it has its challenge
It's clear that killing isn't how a human is supposed to be wired, given its adverse psychological effects on so many people.
that reminds me of that EA logo
12hmm?
"challenge everything"
or their 'old one'
It's not clear, we've just grown used to not killing
2000-03 ish
12ll
12lol
To not killing? We kill more than ever.
and no school tomorrow

Technology and science have just helped us do so more efficiently, though they do more good than harm./
12i really like those games though
12i need to track down the first one
12it's the only one i don't have
how about download from pirates?
/me shots
I mean personal killing, like straggling someone or shooting someone in the head from a meter away
0.o
Nuke a population, and its far less personal than stabbing each one. That's the difference, psychologically.
So yeah, I agree.

12i can do that

12you support by buying it
How do you all feel about world hunger?

12afterall if they lose out on money, it's less money for them to make more games :P
I think we need to find out exactly what to feed a planet.
Comets?
lol funny
But in reality, there is more than enough food to go around in the world, it's just hoarded by those with easy access to it.
It may be cruel but I consider it population-control
I think considering it mainly effects underdeveloped parts of the world, it's not a very efficent form of that.
No, but think how bad the planet would be if everyone was well fed
If it cut down more people in places like China, that would be better, all offense aside. They have more population than they know what to do with, while places like Africa and such have skeletons roaming around.
Make them swap then
Not to say that Africa isn't heavilty populated too, lol.

It has changed my life.
Rick Astley sounds so funny. XD
I do believe I'll run off to the penguins because of this.

juffo wup no one gives a [censored] about the baby seals here so if your trying to troll you fail so hard
Baby seals are so cool.
Invisible writing?
This is marvelous technology.

It emits awesome radiation.
I made a song about radiation, once.
juffo wup is the dumbest name i've ever heard
It was a pretty terrible song.

God I hate the CMA.
It clogs up all the traffic.
The problem with Nashville.
Even the airwaves are terrible.

But there's a limit, you know?
But no.
Always about the deceased dogs, and the trucks, and the shooting whiskey, and the...
ARGH
I mean, seriously.
It's better than pop music.
But so is a rotting turtle dead six months.
I hate smashing turtles on the road.
Smashing armadillos is far superior.
The buzzards don't have as much of a problem.
Mess gets cleaned up, everyone is happy.
BUT NO
Darn turtles.
And they have to be endangered, too.
I find this out after my dogs bit one's leg off.
It died, I got in some hot water with the authorities.
I don't control my dogs.
My dogs don't control my dogs.
The leash does.
The turtle wandered withing range of the leash.
All I'm saying, it got what was coming for it.
Namely, the leg being gnawed off.
And dying.
Just one more...
YES
Screen is filled.
Now I can stop spamming, I have achieved happiness.

06why thank you
I'z okay.
06so wheee, I went to the groomers today
06got a trim, I'm all floofy minus frizzy hair

He's Icepik
Your timing is bad as always
why is my timing bad
That question was asked almost half an hour ago lol
oh well
and yes he's annoying as [censored]
/me noms on roara's tail
he sent me a pm last night that just asked some randomly stupid question
/me floof
I just ignore him
is there any way to block PMs from a certain person?
/me gnaws the floof too
I don't think so
not on the forum
Not the forum
Here
oh
I doubt it, but I'm just making sure
I just ignore them
or close them
Yes
:o
Arg
lol
Can I tell if someone's blocked me?
Yes, they wont respond to you lol
You have to use the /ignore command, but I'm not sure what the IceChat syntax for it is
I don't need to do it; I just need to know if I'm being blocked
Why?
There's no way to tell if you're being /ignore'ed
oh
well great
Or even /silence'ed
just great
Unless they're ignoring everything you say completely
They could be getting the messages and just not responding too
Either way you're being ignored
who are you trying to send messages to
SR
He blocked me on gmail last night
Screw him
lol
He overreacted to some joke I made and it now ignoring everything I say
lol
no wonder he's so in and out now
what'd you say to him
You should all just leave him in the lurch, then he'd perhaps change his ways
she just made a joke
He takes you all for granted
Well he was being really weird and making everything into a joke
@fresh A snowball would have a better chance in hell
So I implied something about being drunk
And he got super offended for some reason
:O
I dont know why you bother
...I don't know why either
It just makes me sad

Or better question, did Valve not expect massive server usage when they offered TF2 for free (for a few days)?
/me hasn't tried Portal on the comp yet...
/me sneezes the ashes back on kyu

FFF.
TF2's free now
at least for this weekend

WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TF2.
/me actually GOT Portal, tho o3o
I did, too
For free.
:D
12I know lolz
/me prefers it for 360 tho XD

Huh... this is interesting, apparently a person in Australia owns a complete IBM 7094 with two IBM 1401 systems as well... drat I wish I had enough money to buy the box. (Buy the box == ship it to Canada.)

And wow, bro.
12o3o
I get familarized with russian with songs
and OW my hand XD
my veins are hurting o3o
I know plenty of other canadians.
And an IBM 7094 in private hands (and if it could be made functional... which is probable), would be equal to being crowned "King of All Nerddom."
Well I am as well, as you may know. I'm not as hardcore as you, but I know my basics.
(Plus, it's just plain /awesome/.)

Hello
Guess no one's here
Basically, owning /that/ beastie of a computer is the pinnacle of all nerddom. (Though, you'd probably spend a small fortune on renovating your basement... as you need a powerful HVAC system, massive power lines, and a raised floor. :P )
12hmm
12I understood renovating your basement and raised floor
12but the rest...
12o3o
HVAC = air conditioning - Computers like that... get warm. Fast.
Massive power lines: If a computer is the size of a small room... your wall outlet isn't going to be able to power it. :P
12lolz
12I see o3o
(Though, you may be able to blow every single breaker in your neighbourhood trying to power it up from your wall outlet.)
12o3o
/me in-one-ear-and-out-the-other's

/me puts another stick of RAM in LL
03now you have even more memory
/me o3o
/me has a stick inside it? :O

03I said RAM >:|
03and I don't mean 'ram the stick inside you' either
12and memory=brain=baby?

If I could even afford shipping it in the first place, I would probably have enough money to renovate my place into having space for it.
/me adds injury to injury and slaps him again for LL
03LOL injury to injury
hmm
However, as I don't have the exorbitant amount of money needed to ship it to me. I will sate myself with it's emulated equivalent. :P
03+space
K
So
(Though, it's not as fun to watch your desktop blast through a bunch of batch jobs, and then page through a small boring text file for the results.)
/me gets knocked out by the shoe 7 minutes later
Clearing out a mine, armed only with throwing knives, molotovs, snd dynomite isquite difficult...
I was showering
:P
It is if you don't watch your back ;)
It's much cooler to watch the machine as it's actually working on it. (Watching the console lights blink, the tape drives spin. And hearing the 1403 printer pattering out the data... it's a wonderful scene.)
03why, you back stabber :P
Because I play way to much tf2 :p
/me avoids since nameless minions are by definition unimportant and can't kill main characters
Probably a modern server room. Minus the tape drives and the line printer.
Probably.
And who you calling nameless D:<
Also, a modern server room, and a massive retro mainframe also have the "Make People Swear" button on them, which is awesome. :P
What does it do? I wonder...
On a mainframe... flick any number of switches, and watch people suddenly attempt to lop your head off using a trout. In a server room... smack the either "Emergency Off" button on the UPS, or activate the fire-fighting system.
o3o
I still hate that emote.
(The switches on the mainframe: "HALT" - Stops the computer. Can be fixed with "RUN". "INITIAL PROGRAM LOAD" - Makes the computer reboot... non-fixable. "SINGLE-STEP" - Stops the computer, and causes the operator to have to repeatedly smack "RUN" to make it do anything, can be fixed by unflicking it and hitting "RUN". The power switch - duh. The emergency power switch - even more duh.)
12o3o
Also, the fire-fighting system is applicable to both.
As usually, it will either kill /all/ power to the room and start spraying fire supressant liquid. Or it will start filling the room with Halon. :P
Lol
Since Halon is a gas... it also usually causes a /very loud/ alarm to go off... so not only do you incense every computer user (and cost the place of business several thousand on replacing the gas), you also cause the admins to lose their hearing for a few days. :P
I have no idea how to respond to that except by asking if this is the extent of all the security measures present in the system.
Also, Halon 1301 has the side-effects of when a room is flooded, causing a massive cloud of condensation fog to form. And inhalation results in giddiness... (Do not use around already hyperactive children... they can become worse.)
12lolz
xD
(Also, the proper chemical name of Halon 1301 is kind of funny sounding "Bromotriflouromethane" try saying that ten times fast.)
Reminds me of antidisestablishmentterrinaism.
:p
07haha you spelled it wrong o2o
07+1
>:(
I'm working on it
03LOL +1
I got the last half wrong.
Terianism
...
07tarianism
07o3o
07and it's 1 t
!define antidisestablishmentarianism
-!- Antidisestablishmentarianism (listen to , ) is a political position that originated in nineteenth-century Britain in opposition to proposals for the disestablishment of the Church of England, that is, to remove the Anglican Church's status as the state church of England, Ireland and Wales.
There
So yeah
So how is everyone doing today?

gonna try and figure out a way to get video game footage
oh awesome
and make a video with some of that
the songs I sang on were more of the electro ones lemme see if there are any links
i was on here yesterday
I did an acoustic one too though
if I can't figure that out I have a project that I've been working on for over a year I really need to finish
nobody really talks here
lol
lol
not even hard either
lolz they were yesterday. but then they suddenly just stopped
a moc[censored]entary about one of my friends

lol
that Miles kid is annoying as [censored]
1:58 on the video is where backup comes in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpE8d7UeeZ8
Ok, cool, give me a minute for my [censored]ty connection to load it
yeah
I think so too
this guy is too suspicious
wait what
tell me more
yesterday he tested spyrochat for "spam detection"
what did he say before
..
he went all across this network asking everybody how to get unbanned
..alright, now I'm scared
I thought he was just an idiot at first
/me goes to remove photos on spyroforum of herself
which seems kinda trollish
Hahaha
don't want any chantards to use them
it's not funny ;___;
sorry
they made profiles of all the mods last time
I'll correct myself
and took photos and information and links and [censored] of me they had all my profiles on everything
Don't want those god [censored] good for nothing [censored]ing chantards to go and do that [censored]
...
there
more serious
oh, [censored], they took your personal info and everything?
yes.
my whole point.
That's just creepy
all my photos and everything
i know
;___;
/me goes to remove pictures of himself too, even though he isn't a mod
I haven't been on the forum for a few days
just the mods
have there been any hints at trolls there?
yes
uh oh
You know, I don't even know why I bother with this forum anymore if we're going to keep getting attacked.
yeah, and it really doesn't seem like SR cares about the forum anymore
to be honest...
I never see him post or anything
yeah.
he doesn't give two [censored]s
it's just not worth it.
ugh

"Spyro Is Gay"
that's the sign of a troll trying too hard to mix in
yeah
>.>
yeah, this doesn't look good
hopefully it's just a bunch of idiots who happened to join at the same time and nothing comes of it
ugh....if I were old enough I'd need a beer right now...
I just hope it's a small troll group if it's a troll group at all
yeah
Should check the IPs, I think a lot of those are the same guy
I remember when I first joined there was dude called ilovemesomepurple[censored]
O.o
was that around the time of the first attack?
nope
I've been a member since 08 the first attack was in 09
the first attack was that T3h guy, right?
2I have a question
maybe it really is one guy but just trying to scare us because we're hyper aware of it
12you rang?
12sorry
12i don't deliver pizza
03XD
yeah he posted the site on a massive troll forum to plan an attack
yeah
12but if the tip is big enough
12i'll do anything you want :P
they were gonna post spyro pr0n and put huge images in the signatures to eat up RAM, eventually they were gonna try to hack into the admin somehow too
12this must be a long question
12i'm worried now x-x
I never heard of that

2sorry
2my mom wanted something x-x
this one is either a major douche or a definite suspect http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4131.html
yup
probably both
click on yuri
2is it okay if I have Key go over to you and kinda ask for instructions of any kind?
"interest: [censored] and gay relationships"
yep
huh
12do anything you want
12XD
it censors l e sbian but not gay
2XD yay
12as long as you don't bring back the cabbage man
2she's like, one of those people that works better if you tell her what to do
2LOL
anyway, that's beside the point
2yes the cabbage man
lol
2we should steal his cart and throw it at Tomai 8D
apparently Emo thinks he knows Yuri too
2or something
that's probably nothing though
yeah
07lol
brb reboot
2lol hi
he probably just knows someone who uses that name or omething
mhm
he/she is apparently a zombie hunter
2posted
trying to hard to sound like a childish nerd
:P
Lol yeah
XD
yay I'm wiped clean from the pics of you thread
nice
12i might as well read it
you're prepared then
2lol
I think I might leave the forum for a bit.
2somehow
2I managed to make my own char ooc XD
if the trolls see that, they're less likely to target me.
plus I don't need this stress right now.
yeah...
I think that'd leave there being pretty much no mods
2THAT IS NOT KEY
2SHE THINKS TO MUCH
Actually nevermind
I see RDX on a lot
he just rarely posts
yeah
He said he's leaving spyroforum a few weeks ago
12yu
12kyu
12do you plan to post
I dunno if he actually has done that
12or should i go ahead and reply to key?
put my gender to male and age to 20 too like I did last time
maybe they'll think that I'm melon man

2shower bye o3o
12bye
07do that
12you know
07i'm gonna wait for aero
12can weaken a dark wielding dragon like tomai
There you go, that way they'll see that if this is legit
I wish I could check IPs, but I can only do that if the accounts post.
ohh
yup
[censored]
07chaos
07o3o
12isn't that just a fancy way of saying dark though
I'm on hidden too so
07no o3o
12fine
07chaos is dark/light
12so far
12glacy hasn't seen any use of light power
keep me updated on what goes on the forum, though :P
if this is for real, I'll participate in the counter attack any way I can
I will
07that barrier
12it's light energy?
07o3o
can't wait to see how that turns out.
again?
07yes
12why didn't you say so? D:
go look on the "Rules you live by" thread
I agree
he's way too preachy about it
12hmm i think i might still know how to tip the battle in my favor...
then me, I could care less what other people think
12right now i think the battle is like 40/60 in Tomai's favor lol
he tried to convert me in PMs xD
I don't try to force anybody to change their beliefs because I know thjat's impossible
12isn't key an ice user?
XD I can imagine how that went
07water
12ouu
12interesting :3
then SR yelled at me when I told Adam Thurman to stop trying to convert me
because SR can read everyone's PMs and he read our convo
12i'm going to enjoy having key by my side
I never realized it until recently, but SR's kinda adamant with his religion too
SR's never forced religion upon me and I've never really witnessed him do it to anyone else but I guess it's possible
well, I can't see him forcing it
but he seems very serious about his beleifs
which isn't a bad thing if he doesn't force it
yeah
I feel the same about both religious and atheist
I guess you could say I'm in the middle
I don't have any sort of belief
I don't know what I really believe most of the time
I think things are certain ways one day and something else the next.
yeah
One day I'll think there's a god, the next I'll think that there is fate, the next I'll think that Hell's the best place to be, the next there's just life and nothing else.
life's actually so much less complicated when you look at it that way too
The cycle goes on.
12i don't know if i can beat Tomai but i know i can really irritate him
I don't see how people can only view life one way.
12if i only can predict his movements XD
07lol
I try to see it everybody's way
I try to understand all of their beleifs
yup
exactly, and that's what irritated me in one of spyro22's posts
it's like
you can learn about another religion and still have your own belief
.____.
I loved my religion class /because/ I learned about other religions
even though I am one
12next post i might actually get involved
I just want to know how all the world works
mhm
exactly
it's fun to explore and contemplate what makes the most sense I think
yup
yeah, I agree
07o3o
rawr pplz rawr
12just saying that so you don't think i'm being lazy and not part taking in the fight XD
07o3o
07Aero?
Actually it's funny when some people start arguing about how great Catholocim is and they get it wrong
lol
12that is not aero
12that is a guest
:D
like if a Catholic ever says that the Bible is divine word, that's not what Catholics beleive
03LOL wut
he was denying to me that d a m n was in the bible.
wat wut
but it's like
wat wut is what?
they say that word all the time
12hi wild Lyon of doom
if it's not in the bible, where on earth did the phrase "[censored]ed to hell" come from, then?
07oh
exaaactly!
07o3o
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
he claims to love the Bible so much but it sounds to me like he's never even read it
thjey always talk about [censored]ation and stuff
Hell, I've never read the Bible and I knew that
yes
I blame Manuu
I've actually never read it either
04HELOOOO
07ohai
but I've read parts of it
04how are you all?
and I go to church every week
2o3o

2lol Kyu
but really I'm just interested
epic fail :U
/me 2uses Strength to flip a table
oh I know
maybe they're afraid of being proven wrong or something, I dunno
0_o
I think it's better for them to know about other religions
but they're a huge religion and it's not like it's going to die out anytime soon you know?
then they're not ignorant
you needed strength to do that lol
yup
yeah
2eh?
2no, 591
/me hugs
2I just felt like using it
ah
07Key doesn't need weapons until she relearns her magic o3o
12she needs all the strength she can get
and I love talking about religion too
but like this
06ACT POIPLE NAO
not to extreme atheists or extreme religious people
exactly I hate the people that are all like "THIS IS RIGHT AND THIS IS WRONG"
because either way, they're too one sided
yep...
06the bug likes uranium
it isn't all black and white like that
it isn't so simple
if it was there would only be one religion and everybody would follow it
yep
2o3o yes
03o.o
lol, now I'm rambling
2but I'm just pointing out how she's watching what you guys do, but can't put it to practice anyway
2o3o
I hate it when religion because like racism
yeah

I could care less about the religion as long as the music's good
12after what happened to me yesterday XD
exactly
2o3o
12i'm still irritated
yep
2o3o
12the woodtick i found in my bed

underoath lost all their chances of me becoming a fan for that
06o_o
12derp
2-this stupid ingrown toenail
yeah
/me explodes some random stuff with dynamites
068D
it's funny how some bands create their own little soap opera dramas
2o3o
12key is going to be very important to me for these next few posts XD
oh I know right, chiodos started some drama with craig owens a day or two ago about some demo
2XD lol
actually, almost all bands I know of do that eventually
that he didn't even want a lot of people to hear
2something is actually IMPORTANT?
2I knew it
2It's the end of the world!
and Craig Owens let it out to the public?
/me places back on her post

04oh
2that's why I didn't
or the music drama I know the most about
06ROUNDHOUSE TORNADO >:U
people say he wanted to get "revenge" on chiodos for kicking him out of the band but that sounds like total [censored] to me the guy's so successful by himself
07but Arthur should be following Fiora's advice o3o
2o3o oh
2riiiiight
Ha, wow
yeah
2der
/me 2facepalms

I don't really know a story but I know the members are blink-related
2lol personal bodyguard
2XD
i like A&A way better than blink though :P
for a while it was basically like Tom Delonge was "cheating on" blink with the other members of A&A
2oieoaghdsljfls that reminded me of Mafias XD
06MAMAAAA!!!! ICE CREAM MAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!
and eventually he left blink, but through his agent
he never told the other two
oh jeez.
Yeah, I actually prefer A&A too
that really is a soap opera. XD.
and then they all got all [censored]y for no real reason
/me explodes
04Kyu
it sounds like a dating story
04I didn't know Dragorie could summon Chaos spears
sounds like our bot story
they're just a bunch of drama kings but I love their music
lol yeah
XD
07o3o
exactly like it
07well you haven't seen Dragorie actually fight o3o

07aside from that one thing when he yawned and then killed that guy XD
I actually prefer A&A too
12a fatal yawn?
04lol
but I still like blink a lot
I've only heard a couple songs but yeah lol

Oh, crap
I closed the wrong tab
/me burns it
/me unburns it and takes it for herself
I hate it when I do that haha especially if it's gmail or something and I'm talking to someone
I must look so rude XD
yeah I know, right
HOLY CRAP
CLIFFHANGER.
have you ever been talking to someone and forgot you were talking to them and closed the tab?
A BAD ONE.
I did that on Facebook once
PROBABLY 'CAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE BETTER CHARS.
yes I've done that XD
I felt awful when I remembered I was talking to him

there's this annoying amv maker kid that takes like 20 minutes to reply to me on things
and his replies are usually pretty much what I said, but in a question.
So pretty much the same but a question?
:P
jk
and I won't say anything to him for like. SEVEN HOURS. and then he'll suddenly say "well I have got to go nice talking to you!"
I did that on purpose
XD
it's like DUDE IT'S BEEN A FEW HOURS, I DON'T CARE, JUST LEAVE :P
Hahaha
"Forgot you even existed, no need to say bye"
exaaaactly
he'll always be like "hi :)" and I'll say "hi what's up" and he'll say nothing for about 20 minutes then he'll say "nothing really how about you? :) :)"
XD
and he always seems to think that I'm depressed or something just because I don't use smileys in every single message I write
so whenever I say "I'm fine" and (after about 15 minutes of course) he'll say "good!!!! :)"
so he corrects that by having an overload of his own smileys
exactly he has the [censored]ing laughing or smiling face in every [censored]ing message he sends XD
it just gets so old so fast
his videos suck so much too
it's gotta be annoying when there's more than one smiley per sentence too
XD
so I was laughing my ass off when he was suprised
would you like to see his fail?
:D
Yes!
warning your eyes will bleed
ok
Yay!
http://youtube.com/user/sorarikukiari94
don't watch the collab one though that one's ok because there's another editor in it
click the one below called "mep part"
does he always use all these rainbow colors?
gets nauseating
yes.
and his clip choice just NEVER MAKES SENSE
whoa
haven't left
XD
too many inverted rainbow colors turns me into a [censored]
I can't even read anything there without getting a headache
lol
Waay too many colors
yup
2XD
/me [censored]in rocks at colors though :D
colors are my favorite thing to mess around with :D
and the video itself has like an awkward glare
yours is cool too because there's always a theme to the colors and they don't kill the eyes
yup
I only do colorful [censored] if it's like a pop song lol
like lady googoo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHh-iAQNCkA
lol @ the awkward strobe lights he put in at the end
omg I know right ahahah
I don't like playing around with effects too much
makes it look like I'm an amateur trying to look skilled
me either but people can't seem to grasp the fact that I can't do rainbow effects lol
lol
I've actually never even tried rainbow effects
I've made lightning SFX
but that's the only time I ever bothered going out of the way with effects
I love messing with colors though I always make a ton of gradient maps
I have tons of my own premades
colors I mess with
I just like to keep them barely noticable, but that's just because of the type of video I've done would be awkward if it became all pinkm or whatever
yeah
it's totally different with cartoons XD
Haha yeah
with cartoons I can make extra shadows and stuff
that's why I want to do that video game thing
I can do stuff that I can't with actual footage
mhmm
I don't like always using actual footage because there aren't exactly a lot of actors here
if you ever ended up using some kind of cartoon I'd def collab with you haaha
/and/ I'm not charismatic (or rich) enough to work with any of them
Haha, we should do that sometimes
*sometime
I'll get some practice with that sort of editing first
because I'm sure it's different
Haha
me either
I only have two
XD
but then again
we do it weird
It's so WEIRD to have some little kid spazz out and say "OMG, BRIANOBSESSED JOINED MY TEAM!"
or "BRIANOBSESSED WANTS TO BE IN MY MEP"
it's like O__o yeah I do...?
my friend and I have a youtube channel where we post the videos we make together
and then there's my channel
which has nothing because I haven't done anything individual that I'm proud enough to upload
lol
Haha, you're a youtube celebrity I guess
well in the amv community I guess
I remember when I was a n00b
I overused so many effects experimenting with vegas XD
also: my friend and I only have like 5% of our stuff on youtube
not even
because most of it's on DVDs
and we wanted to sell them
lol
not gonna make much profit if it's all on youtube
haha
well actually
you can make profit off of youtube if it's all entirely your content
haha, thankfully my n00b days of editing were when I was still in school
with the school's iMovie software
you can?
yeah
as long as you don't use any music that isn't yours
or any footage like videogames that isn't yours
ah
see there's the problem
if you do the videogame thing though you'd have to keep it in seperate channels
I always use music that isn't mine
XD
music?
yeah
heya Proto
Hah, this is what I get for coming at 1:40 in the morning :P
you can't really sell it then without some sort of legal deal coming up
omg
04Eon
even on DVDs
07o3o
someone's talking
/me throws Eon an Eevee
you'd need to buy permission to sell it
2hi
we only sold it to friends anyway
which is a [censored]load of money
ah
sold like 5 copies
lol
lol
Bleh, I forget how to register names.
is that a rarity ?
For some reason
lol
Tonight's been rather quiet
brb
our first DVD (which was all a joke anyway) had all the songs in the credits with a disclaimer saying "We're not allowed to use this song" for all of them
2o3o
good haha
yea my channel has been the same way
well kinda
earlier was busy
it was pretty much the stupidest video I ever made
but that's why it was so much fun
omg, do you wanna see the first video I ever made ever??? it's like, a live action filmed thing and it sucks so bad XD
I just had a [censored]load of pointless clips from my friend
I made it when I was 10 or 11
Its Password then email, but I got it now
and he said "make a story of this somehow" so I did
2oh o3o
Haha, sure
But thanks :P
I'd show you mine but it isn't online
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfHl5MO64PY

Hahaha
i was like 10 when i made that lol
it was her first ever project too!

she should be so proud that she created youtube at the age of 10!
:P
I'm gonna go too. Its like, 2 in the morning. I'll be back on tomorro- .... In the morning.
XDD
I'm gonna upload the first few minutes of the video I've been working on, It may take a while though to upload
what's the file type
Premeire lets you upload it straight from the software
what's the file type
oh
umm
nvm I know what you mean
lemme check
I'm a moron
I never do it that way though
"WHEN I WAS A YOUNGIN IN MY INTERNET DAYS I HAD TO LOG ONTO THE INTERNET TO UPLOAD THE VIDEO"
:P
Lol
ugh I wanna go on another CD store raid
the thing that sucks about our videos though is that they're full of inside jokes
i didnt need that fancy smancy retinal scanner
lol inside jokes
but at least I can show off my editing :D
things were analog in my dade
I miss the days where I had so many inside jokes with my friends...
*days
retinal scanner?
for passwords
ah
your laptop has that?
like scanning your eye?
aaaargh I wish more GOOD editors entered my new MEP, so far everyone's kinda suckish except for like 3 or 4 people
sortof like the face detector and the finger print reader on some of the new note books
infa z that's lame
the toshiba i had had the finger print reader which was awesome
oi
this is not a song it's a sandwich
what would make you think otherwise
cause the bacon is not pork
couldnt be an olson coz it isn't mary kate
Are these all inside jokes?
:P
nope
:D
this is not a song it's a sandwich - psychostick
Oh look, I posted that at exactly one o clock
Ah
07o3o
i don't remember it
I wish I had a better name
I hate mine
so noobish
lol
i remember naming my account brianobsessed
holycrudEon
/me is late
I was feeling uncreative so I used my Xbox Live account name
I like my new user name I use everywhere
"Occupation: cleaning the floor and ignoring annoying teenagers" LOL
XD
I cleaned my first toilet today :D
gross dude
hahaha
...not a good thing
XD
not as gross as I thought though
I never have to touch it
I remember my first username ever
mumble the 2
me too
I hate it
aren't i creative
:P
XD
you already know mine
omg ur a d1nod00d
I like the new one the most
by far'
hmm i have no idea what my best name is
all of them are nerdy too except the second to last one
XD
Aha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fwLek20DeI
this is all he'd let me put on youtube without getting [censored]ed
lol
whoa... fell asleep
because the rest isn't done yet XD
Wake up!
g2g
see ya
I'm proud of the 8-bit intro credit I made
hahahah you must love transitions near the end there
took like three straight hours in MS Paint
XD
lmao
I could never animate I'd get put in an asylum and/or kill myself
way too much time
yeah, I was mocking the people who use [censored]ty transitions actually
I can barely concentrate on drawing a regular photo
video editing is totally my thing though :D
one thing you do see a lot of in my videos is slow motion
I love messing with speeds
I love that too
I have to do a lot of speed changing and cutting when I lipsync sometimes
yeah, I always love doing that
people are so lazy on their lipsyncs it drives me nuts so I always take my time
I like to slow things down to match up with the music and stuff
sometimes I gotta split things and half and slow one down more than the other too to match the words and beat and stuff
lol you said the same thing
yeah, that's another thing that annoyed m about that other guy's video
his lipsyncing was [censored]
yep
I think I'm pretty good at lipsync lol
I'd say so
I've never done it yet, so I don't even know how hard it is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twkPX1qZSmw
not my best but my newest video for lipsyncing
XD I just realized I have like 10 youtube tabs open
XD
mine are youtube gmail owlpages mibbit twitter and facebook
:P
just youtube for me right now lol
lol
I didn't know he mattered that much
</late>
who ?
Things
You said your mind was still wrapped around things >_>
I also got itunes open and adding mass songs to my lfm....should probably open up good old vegas though soon
LOL
nighttime edits are the best :D
o_O
Things has been upsetting DT
nooooo
about women :P
things does not turn me on
I have iTunes open too lol
haha
and Premier
and IceChat
and then that's it
/me opens vegas and wonders what to continue on
I'm so awful
I hate it when I don't do projects in one sitting tbh, they take forever to get done because I always forget about them
I did my noir one in one sitting
it's been a year since I started this and I have no motivation to work on it
yeah you can never wait too long that's bad haha
exactly
I can get so much done in one sitting
mhmm
but then I procrastinate finishing it
short projects are better for me I guess
there is only one project that I have been doing in several different times though that I love so far
movies... not so much
it's a multi crossover one I have had to make images for it at different times
ah yeah
how do you get your footage?
straight off the DVD?
ummm no
I use torrents and I get megaupload/sendspace downloads from youtube descriptions
oh lol
brb
I'm trying to figure out how to do video capture for these games
k
ok back again lol
ok
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZx99CpbXE
ummmm go to google and type in the name of the game along with "filefront"
this is the song I want to do a video to
even though it's really overdone, but nobody else does a very good job lol
k
Haha, it has downloads for the entire game
yup :P
that's where I got my spyro clips when I edited with TLoS
my first amv sucked so bad haha I think it's still on my old account
no, I mean like the game itself is there to download
ahhh
Haha
I like the song so far
:D
It's the song that got me into A&A
cool
I heard one of their songs before it, but this is the one that made me a fan
first A&A song I ever heard was Everything's Magic, I really liked it at first but then the radio started to overplay it and I lost interest
that one's alright
they have never played A&A at the stations out here
out here A&A isn't well known at all
I never listened to pop radio stations before let alone local I always listened to sirius satellite
ah, yeah, that would be why
I don't have Sirius
I used to have it but I don't anymore
it'd play [censored] months before it got in regular local radio
if I listen to radio it has to be the local stuff
it was awesome
Haha, yeah
sirius started my collection of bands
yeah, I bet that's how you heard of a lot of the less well known bands you like
shiny toy guns was always one of my favs off of there I remember
ffffff nothing on alt nation isn't "not well known" XD I know so much stuff that I've never heard anywhere ever
I like anything that sounds good, but there isn't /that/ much on pop radio that I think sounds good
XD
most of it is auto-tuned rap and [censored]
and I don't really like that kind of music
sorry was getting a soda back again
I love one rap artist called mod sun but that's about it for me on rap
lol, okay
I like some rap
in fact
last night
like a song here and there
but very little of it
like that iGeneration song I made the video for
Haha, wow
coincidence
hahahah
I like a few pop artists here and there too
same here
or rather, pop songs
adam lambert's the best pop star on radio today ahahahah
eh, I don't like him much
:P
really I love him I would love to see a live performance that isn't criticized by the media
everything's magic just came on on my iTunes lol
coincidence again
do you like rob thomas
Hmm, doesn't sound familiar actually
REALLY???
yep
he has that song her diamonds and someday
and he's the singer of matchbox 20
Oh okay
I definitely know who he is then
I like Matchbox 20
so I probably like him
cool
I never really like solo artists unless I know them from some other band
idk why, but every band that someone reccommends to me never really grows into me as much as something I find myself.
there's probably a few exceptions but mostly
yeah, same here
actually no\
I know there's tons that I love that I've been reccomended to though
literally all of my favorite bands I heard through my friend that I make videos with
lol
you'd probably like talking to him about music
he's really into punk and indie bands
one of my friends /always/ criticizes my music, but if we said ANYTHING remotely negative about anything she liked she'd have a literal breakdown
cool
but he listens to pretty much anything
she always tells me "LOL I HATE HIGH VOICES" but one time one of my other friends and I told her we didn't like nickleback coz of the guy's voice and she had a breakdown and didn't talk to us the rest of the day
awesome so do I
I have all sorts of crap in my library
Ugh, I do not like Nickleback
nickleback sux
Completely overrated
I love how she's so hypocritical too, she says people shouldn't take things so seriously over the internet but she totally does
hahaha
oversensitive people do not belong on the internet
people like that are so anoying, but so fun to complain about
:P
I never get bothered whenever someone tells me they don't like my music, she always does and I think she does it to try to make me mad but I never get mad lol
omg I know right
did you feel mad?
apparently she was ranting to one of my friends for like AN HOUR about me, and apparently I think I'm better than everyone else because I'm happy all the time
I lol'd like so hard
Hahahaa
being happy all the time should be a good thing
but yeah it's like "gee sorry i'm not an emo kid like you"
I used to be like the emoest kid ever 3 years ago
I try to be happy as much as I can and fail alot XD
listening to only my chemical romance and complaining about how much i hate life hahahahah
I was a bit angsty about 4-5 years ago
never really emo, because I kept all my depressing thoughts to myself
lol
but a couple years later I got over the [censored] that was bothering me and now I try to be a positive person
though most my music is still angsty lol
Haha, really?
yeah a lot of music has totally changed me as a person
same here, I became positive when I started listening less to punk
XD
"if you allow something so unnecessary get you down there's no one else to blame" is the one of my favorite lyrics ever
Huh, what song is that?
I think I've heard it
it's one I think about most when I'm sad
lol, maybe not
he and will francis are the two musicians who have reshaped my life the most
that's funny because the song I always try to cheer myself up with when I'm sad is an A&A song
haha don't you love it when there's one album or artist that can always get you happy again???
that's how conviction and avalon are for me :D
Yeah, A&A is pretty much that band for me
that was actually Tom Delonge's goal when he started the band
cool
he was getting sick of singing about egative stuff
or so he says
:P
lol
will francis made william control to put all the negative stuff in xD
srsly his album hate culture really is a hate culture it's the meanest album i've ever heard
Haha wow
I don't really have any hateful music persay
a few songs, yeah
his new album is not near as bad as the first though because now he's got his wife and kid haha last one he was so "aloooone"
but not entire albums
yeah same I have a few angsty hate things here and there
I have at least 5 songs for every emotion I'd say
XD
lol
I can never really listen to individual songs at a time unless I'm totally addicted to a certain one, but even if i put my library on shuffle I skip like literally 200 songs each only to get to one that I /kinda/ want to hear
usually I just listen to full albums
I'M SO OLD SCHOOL *shot*
I try to listen to all my songs on shuffle
that's how my mom listens to her music lol
but there usually is a specific song or band I'm waiting for the whole time
some albums I can't listen to without hearing it all in order though
haahahah I do that sometimes when I shuffle my actual ipod while I'm playing a videogame or something and I'm too lazy to go and select it
yeah same
like the type of album where they blend the songs into each other
I love when they do that
I dunno why
I listen to avalon every morning first no matter what otherwise i'm a [censored] all day
it's a proven fact.
:D
lol
omg me too
circa survive did the song blending on their last album
I always listen to it all the way through like that ugggh <3
was it the entire album too?
alesana did that too but idk if you'd be that into them
yeah the entire album
I only have one CD that does it all the way through
I have a fw
*few
a few others do it for a few of the songs, but not all
yeah
there's a ton of others but I can't think of them right now
ugh, don't ever buy a mutemath album
alesana's newest does it all the way through
it even has speaking pieces in between them
why i love mutemath XD
I thought they'd be good but it's just boring
maybe it's just the CD I bought
I have armistice bu not any others
...that's the one I have
XD
sometimes for me it takes me a few full listens to really love it
like once again lol circa's first album, it took me a LONG time to get into it and like it, but now I'm in love with it
that happens for me with songs too
that may be it
I'll totally hate something at first then I'll end up loving it the more I hear it
I haven't listened to the album much
I get that a lot too
or vice versa
I love it at first then it gets boring
hahaha vice versa works for me too, usually with radio
I think you'd like the band Mansions
hmm
What kind of music is it?
ummm hmm
I'll be honest I'm REALLY terrible with genres I just listen to whatever sounds good
lol, that's okay
:D
idk if you get that
Ah
but
yeah
it's great
I think I know what you mean
I'd show you my favorite song but it's not on youtuuuube :( I can send it through sendspace though if you like
helps me to picture it because it's raining really hard here
XD
lol
what's sendspace?
oh filehosting
a site that people usually use for sending mep parts/collab parts/songs n [censored] to their friends
okay
do I need a membership?
nope
it'll take a few seconds to upload though one second :P
okay
last fm is also a great way to discover new bands btw it looks at how often you listen to what and then gives you really accurate results on new stuff to look at
http://www.sendspace.com/file/qcy52f
XD estimated download time is 15 minutes
XD
god [censored] your computer is slow lol
usually stuff like that downloads in less than 10 seconds for me
oh, 10 minutes now
lol
it likes me :P
lolno
just yell at it, it likes discipline
haha, my connection is usually okay, until you try downloading something
haha, if I were home alone and nobody was a sleep I really would
*asleep
lmfao
6 minutes...
i'm always home alone all day, it's not all it's cut out to be but at times I really love it, I really would be in an asylum or something if I wasn't home alone to myself all day
grr, speed up
I like being home alone a lot
but my family doesn't like to leave very much
:P
lame lol
hence the reason I spent all of last weekend at a friend's house XD
sometimes I wish my uncle didn't have to work again I loved having him here all winter and the beginning of spring we went out and did stuff all the time
yeah
but he could be like my mom and always complain about not doing enough
:P
hahaha
he always got up at like 2 pm lol i don't think that'd ever happen
Well, not doing enough "with the family"
she gets annoyed at me sitting on my laptop and Xbox all the time
sounds like my dad before we kicked him out, he'd always complain how he /never/ gets to fish or /never/ gets to golf
Haha
my dad always got mad at me for being on the "god[censored] computer all day"
heh, it gets annoying
my dad was a mean old drunk :( I always walked on eggshells, it's kind of a relief that he moved out
my dad says those exact same words from time to time
I'm sorry that you had to grow up with a life like that
ooooh free downloads on lfm that are actually good yay
ah it's alright haha my uncle is the like the dad I never had
It's good that you're able to be happy all the time now
that's good
1 minute left
erg, so close
lol
i'm downloading a whole album off last fm that's faster than your download for one song :P
Hahaha
10 seconds left!
Done
you should still seriously consider making one that site the greatest thing since the first website ever
YAY DONE
:P
hmm, this is cool so far
this does sound like music I like
thanks
yup :D
I bet I now have a song that my friend hasn't heard
finally, /I/ can recommend a song to /him/
:P
XD
I have tried to find a mansions album everywhere but I can't find any physical copies :( I have one digital album though
I love it so much
If you can't find a physical copy I never will
XD
lol
yeah I got this califone ep last time I did a CD raid, I never really listened to them but my beloved ag had a song about them so I figured it had to be good, it's really good and apparently it's a super rare EP that I found too
so double win on that
:D
Hahaha, nice
Another place I hear new music from a lot is movies
oh you know a really good music movie is nick and norah's infinite playlist
one of my favs
I like almost all types of movies so I get a large variety of music from them
cool
oh yeah, you've told me about that one
I haven't been able to find a physical copy of the kick ass soundtrack either which really suprises me
I wanna get it though
yeah, I looked at the soundtrack online and it looks like a good one
I still have to see that movie
funniest movie I've seen in a long time
it was really ogod
*good
that's good, because I haven't seen a good comedy in a while
I really wanna see this karate kid remake this weekend
except Zombieland
that was good
Yeah, that does look good
I don't really see Jackie Chan as the wise old man type though
lol
whenever I see him I think of Rush Hour
and I thought both of the Rush Hour movies were stupid
I remember the freaking jackie chan cartoon hahahahahah
Oh yeah hahaha
I completely forgot about that
over the top haha
04hey Arti
07ohaiburd
That Robin Hood movie was dumb
hi Arti
I thought it looked way too serious
haha
Robin Hood is supposed to be a playful thief\
not a stern war hero
12Ra!
yes
exactly
:P
it was way too serious
07ra ra ra ah ah
/me dances
the friar was still whymsical and cool
but all the other characters they got all wrong
lol
12Bake off is today!!
if it wasn't called Robin Hood I would've liked it more lol
12Can't wait to see all the other entries LOL
12and eat them!Q
it could've made a good middle ages war movie
mhm
I read that as cake.
I love movies that aren't meant to be taken seriously but some people do anyway
omg me too hahahah people called Year One a bad movie because it wasn't "accurate" but it's not supposed to be accurate and factual it's a comedy for god sake's people need to grow up
Zombieland and Inglorious Basterds were both like that
Hahaha, yeah
I don't get how anybody could get upset about that one
you know what I hate? people who are always so politically correct and can never make jokes about anything and then preach at people for a joke
Michael Cera and Jack Black do not start in accurate religious movies
yup
they star in ridiculous comedies
it's just what they do
mhmm
Ugh, yeah I hate that too
like the Monty Python movies
XD
they were all banned for a while
g'night
because people were offended by their jokes
people give so much hate to my poor redneck jonny craig because of his jokes about women and whhores haha
hahaha
on twitter mostly too he always "retweets" all the hate he gets
someone once said "You know what's funny? women's rights!"
XD
it's like get over it kid it's a joke
Haha, I saw that happen in person once
it was so funny
do tell :D
guy: "What are you doing your history project on?" girl: "Women's rights" guy: Laughes so hard it isn't even funny. girl: angry stare. guy: "Oh, I thought you were joking"
XD
really though people can't take things so seriously
it's like when you mention a race, even if it's about like a type of food, people throw a tantrum and scream "RACIST!!!!!!!"
"mexican food "RACIST!!!!!!!!111111!!!!!11111!!1!!"
yeah, life isn't fun anymore when they take it to a certain point
Haha, wow
"They're called 'Hispanic'!!!!!1!11one"
you know what else makes me laugh to be honest is the kids that are all like "NO DRUGS SHOULD NOT BE LEGALIZED!!!!!!!"
because some drugs can actually help people if they use them the proper way
and kids don't realize this
yeah
I can see legalizing drugs for medical purposes
but at the same time I can see some people taking advantage of that
yeah like one of the kids I used to go to school with on facebook, one of the apps said "should drugs be legalized???" and she says literally "NO!!!!!"
and a ton of her friends "liked" the post
I lol'd so hard
Haha
I think that medical purposes it should be legalized but not for everyone on an everyday use.
yeah
I think that's sensible
but I guess if that's what people wanna do then that's their choice and they'll learn the hard way
like with cigarettes and alcohol
alcohol is a hell of a lot worse than some drugs IMO
but I also think that if it's legalized it should only be for medical reasons
but out of them all cigarettes are probably the thing that's least likely to kill someone
yeah, I'm not too big a fan of alcohol
alcohol not only can kill the user of it but others around them in say a car crash
different people have different tolerances, so nobody knows how much is too much until it's too late
yup
and then they become either stupid or dangerous
and I don't want to take the chance of finding out which one I am
yup
my dad = two car wrecks this month
that's just sad
mhmm
that's how he chose to live his life though I guess
yeah
too bad it's a lifestyle that harms others as well >.>
I always think that if someone can't see their problems themselves then they're never going to get out of it no matter how hard others try to stop them
I think it's possible for them to get a wake up call through someone else
but it has to be something huge
because habits are not easy to get rid of
yep.
especially if you don't even know you have one
yes but there's also the people that go "fffff I can stop any time I want"
and never do
like my dad
those kind of people are just in denial
I don't think anything will wake him up until something bad happens
they don't realize that it's taken hold and they can't stop, no matter how mucht they think they can
they just use it as an excuse I think
I think so
my mom says I'd be a good therapist hahaha idk about that though
Hahaha
To be honest I can't see you as a therapist right now
:P
me either
you'd be a good one, but it doesn't fit your personality
apparently what I say makes me seem like a good therapist to her or something
"I think a little AG will help your problem"
yeah I could never sit there and listen to people whine and [censored] all day
I like to think of myself as being good at that
...it actually would :P in a way he is my personal therapist, I made this optimism interview mix a couple weeks ago and I always listen to the podcast
but then there are the times I try helping people and it only makes it worse
he was a huuuuuuge druggie
yeah me too
I hate when that happens so much
it almost hurts worse than when I'm hurt
yeah I know what you mean
I have a friend that's fairly happy with herself but tbh I think I [censored]ed up her life
:(
makes me sad all the time
gotta cope with it though, can't dwell on [censored] you can't change
yeah
that's how I see it
that's how I try to see it
people that think about the bad stuff that happens to them all the time will never get anywhere.
I wish so hard I could change the bad things
actually that inspiring song I told you about earlier
here are the lyrics of it that I always think of:
once people grieve over what has happened, they need to switch over and think about how they can make it better.
12Hai ^^'
14Mornin
07o3o
07BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!
4BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"If I had a chance for another try, I wouldn't change a thing, it's made me all of who I am inside. And if I could I'd thank God that I'm here and that I am alive. And every day I wake I tell myself a little harmless lie: The whole wide world is mine"
see that's what made me all angsty when I was younger
that's a good quote to have
grief I couldn't get over
12BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
04INTERRUPTING BLERUERHGUEHGH!!!!!
14lol
and I blamed myself for an awful thing I did
instead of trying to get over it
and learn from it
yeah, I kind of try to live by that quote
it's hard to sometimes though
I think the biggest mistake I've ever made and made myself really sad alot in the past was pretending I was a boy for 2 years to friends that I grew close to and then telling them I was a chick the whole time :P it sounds dumb I know but it sucked
or at least, my biggest mistake in the internet world.
No, I can understand completely how hard that would be
can't think of anything bigger right now
but yeah I was really unhappy with my self for the longest time
so I just pretended to be someone I wasn't in a way
that's what I did too
I regret doing it now
12LOLZ
12^v^
I should've always been me
oh?
that sucks
12want to see what I baked last night with Xai? I just got pics
I mean how I dealt with it
07no.
I didn't pretend to be a girl
/me runs
:P
yeah I figured
I basically treated one of my friends like [censored] when others were around
D;
he had muscular dystrophy
I...do not know what that is
12XD
12FINE THEN
has little to no control over his muscles
ah
long story short something happened that made me realize the hard way how much of an [censored] I had been
at first I was just miserable
07XD
:(
but eventually I started trying to change myself instead
and now I'm a better person because of it
:D
but I still hate thinking of how I used to be
me too
12http://h.imagehost.org/0831/cupcakes.jpg
12They are cinnamon flavoured ^v^
07I said NO D:
12Too bad XD
I still wish I was actually a guy from time to time but I can't make myself depressed over something I have no control of
12http://j.imagehost.org/0287/cupcakes2.jpg
07stooooooooooooooooop D:
thanks for hearing me out
I hardly ever talk to anyone about the whole false male deal either these days
Yeah, I know what you mean
I remember my dad was so mad when he found out that I was pretending to be a guy for some reason
There are things about myself I wish I could change too
I don't see why he would be mad about that to be honest
mhmm
a guy on the internet is so much safer than a girl, for one thing
maybe he was hoping I wouldn't turn out the way I did, even though he doesn't really know quite yet
yeah I agree
and form another, he can't change who you are
bakinigurl48375
haha
my mom was never at all bothered that i pretended to be a guy or what I turned out to be she knows it all
That's the way it should be
04its fun watching you torment Kyu
yup
glad I have at least 1 parent supporting me
12Whats wrong? You want cupcakes?
04lol
and your uncle and your friends
idk what my uncle would think of the situation
07no, I just felt like trying to stop you from posting them XD
04lol
04hey Arti
he respects who you are though, doesn't he?
04is it odd to be obsessed with a Role PLay?
yeah, I guess it would
he doesn't really know about everythiung but he respects me I guess
12No, I know odder things that people are obsessed with
12Like feet :/
04ah
04ok the-
04...
04WAT
12LOL
12I'd say it's slightly odder than being obsessed with Lugia :3
04I just wanted to know because I am obsessed with the DSRP
04._.
04DRP*
and he respects you enough to make you bacon and fish sandwiches :P
lol
I've never had a fish sandwich that's just the dream XD
Oh, lol
I can only imagine how it'd taste
/me dies of thought
I've had a McDonald's fish sandwich
does that count?
XD sure
nothing but fish and cheese inside the buns
but still tasty
my mom and sister are
it actually annoys me so much when I come home and there's nothing to eat that isn't like 10 calories
that must suck ahah
XDD
really though people go way overboard,YOU NEED CALORIES TO LIVE
It's like, how do you ever feel full after a meal like this?
exactly
I like regular food is that so wrong XD
I'm trying to eat healthier because I used to only eat burgers and pizza and [censored] ( I still eat them, but I have vegetables and stuff now too)
I laughed so hard at this commercial where there was gonna be this show where this guy was gonna try to make kids in public school eat better and he shouts
but I still hate their food
"A FRENCH FRY IS NOT A VEGETABLE"
it's too healthy and not filling at all
XD
I couldn't stop laughing because some freak is not going to "change the lives" of elementary school children. calories are GOOD for children they need the energy
I thrive off of burgers pizza fish and snack foods nothing else
my high school had to do this "Wellness Policy" that required them to serve certain foods
I'm so picky :P
haha, that used to be me
minus the fish
somehow I'm not obese and I love it
same here
I'm actually really thin even
haha
even though I've only ever eaten junk food until recently
I feel like if I ate like my sister I would shatter all my bones
normal food is good for normal people, getting fat my ass :P
LOL
there'd be no muscle whatsoever to support myself
hahahahah
and it's impossible to tell her that the human body actually /needs/ fat
yeah I hate vegetarians too, like not because they're veggies just the ones that preach about it
yeah
that gets pretty annoying
cows are meant to be eaten kids get over it
and the fish throwing at pike place market in seattle rarely happens any more because peta got all mad about them throwing the fish around
even though it's an attraction
and the fish is dead already so why the hell should it matter
I couldn't live without meat
See, I don't hunt, but it isn't because I think it's wrong
I'm soooo glad I wasn't born into a vegetarian family
I just get bored
same
one of my other uncles is a hunting fanatic he has like 3 deer heads on his wall
and a hollowed out skull with the antlers
but I don't like it when people hunt and they /don't/ eat the meat
even a fish
yeah
12I need to go get ready for work now
that's just watse
12Seeya later
my other uncle always eats it though so it's ok
*waste
hmm
I agree wholeheartedly with that
I know a lot of people who go for the antlers and through out the extra meat
I hate it so much
me too
it isn't worth killing the animal if you aren't going to do something useful with it
like eat it
i think people should only eat meat and hunt if they realize the value and are thankful for it, thankful that something died to keep them alive
exactly!
not kill an animal for sport alone
that's when it becomes wrong
yup
other than that I'm fine with it all
basically I'm fine with it if there's a point to it all
other than just a [censored] trophy
indeed
in fact I love venison
my favorite meat other than bacon
XD
I'm hungry now
hahahahah
nighttime lunch?
lol, yeah, I'm gonna get some kind of late night/early morning snack
wow, it's late actually
3:00
god [censored] hahah it's 1 here
Eh, I'll be up 4 hours later than this once I start working
Haha, wow
hmm
it's just barely late for you
I'll go once I finish this album...>D I hate listening to an album and then having to leave with it incomplete XD it's a weird habit
Haha, yeah when I'm listening to an entire album I like to finish
yepppp
I also hate when I'm late for something and I have to stop listening to a song and it isn't over yet
XD
yes
especially when it's an awesome song
When I drive places and a song I like is playing when I park I sit in the car util it's over
I hate it when my pets are trying to get me to give them attention during my special morning music therapy
XDDD my mom and I do that too
Haha, tell your pets that's against the rules of therapy
they wouldn't understand :(
then my dog would [censored] on me and walk off
XD
seriously that's how he gets his revenge at the perfect times :(
dogs are stupid
lol
cats are cooler
he'll come over and lay by me for five minutes, [censored], then leave
I has two kitties :D
Wow
I'd hate that
we have a dog and a cat and my mom spoils the dog so much
lol
he lives in the house but the cat lives in the garage and outside
my cat scares my dog so much
he whines when she traps him in the hall
Hahaha
one of my cats is mainly an outdoor cat too
I love watching my cat beat the [censored] out of my dog
his names thunder :D
Oh, cool name
we think that thunder is my first cat reincarnated
because he's JUST LIKE HIM even similar fur patterns and behaviors
my cat just sits there calmy while the dog growls at him and suddenly swats the dog and then starts tackling him
we didn't find him he found us he sat outside our doorstep and meowed as loud as he could no lie
Haha, wow
lmfao
we've had a few cats but they've all had completely different personalities
the one we have now is the best
the old ones all hated me
aww that sucks haha
they always attacked me :(
haha, that's awesome
he's /your/ cat
I've gotten all my pets for free
we always did too, before our dog we have now
and our horses
she loves me because I picked her out of her huge ass litter
but all our other pets have always been from shelters and adoption
cool
kitty [censored]
XD
they were really mean to all their cats though, once they were old enough to go outside they just shoved them out there and never let them in again
kept them in a closet with their mom when they're tiny
all her brothers and sisters probably died
we saved her though ;D
How did you do that?
Were they giving it away or was it stray?
my dog was from the crazy lady next door that needed to be put in a home, she once came to our house and asked my dad to go to the farm with her
and asked our neighbor to go to iran with her
and she'd always ride the bus all over the place
they were giving him away lol
ah
had them in a box there were only 2 left when we got him
then when we were leaving another woman was looking at the last cat contemplating
I wonder if she ever got it
mhmm
noooo my CD ended ;___;
>>
<<
/me turns on an EP
Ha
gotta love EPs
:P
that's when shuffle's nice, it never ends
just starts repeating eventually
but then I'd never get off
true
I have days worth of music, 20 something gigbites
*gigabites
O.O
Wow
1.72 GB
XD
not near as much as one of my friends she has 90 gigs
LOL
how pitiful
:P
16.6 hours
not evne a day!
lemme see what mine is
So very pitiful indeed
31.8 GB, 11.3 days.
hahahahhha
Hahaha
it's times like these when I love me
:P
lol
I haven't listened to music for this long for a while
lol
Oh, by the way
my one friend and I are lfm addicts and love to have our artists race eachother on the charts
and see how often we actually listen to some artists XD
I used to have way more music on my 360
hahaha
lol
had to delete it all a couple days ago actually though
like looking at my charts I can't believe how much I listen to the cure, brand new, and anberlin
that sucks
...the reason I deleted it all is kind of pitiful too
"half asleep not listening to my boring wiiiiiife" oh my god I lol every time
lol why'd you delete it?
well, one of the disks for one of my games was scratched, and with the 360 you can save your games to the hard drive
and my music took up like half my memory
oh jeez...:P
so I got rid of all that music for a stupid video game
I still have it all on CDs somewhere
so now videogames are like computer music downloads that sucks
I'd just have to find them all
lol
I have cds all over the place
200+
yeah it was stupid too
I have about 10 piles in this room
two or three shelves in my room along with about 3 other piles
because the disk was so scratched it didn't even let me save to hard drive
so I deleted it all for nothing
and a pile that I always take on car rides in the living room along with two crates in the living room too
Haha
I have maybe 10 actual albums
....
FAIL.
XD
then a whole bunch of burned CDs I put all my digitally downloaded music on
people look so pitiful next to me whenever it comes to music
I like to make mixes of songs with similar attitudes to play in my car when I drive
omg
so I have a lot of CDs for that
so
I ripped a couple of CDs for my uncle when he was being mean one time near the beginning of the month
for him to listen in his car
gtg
...bye
XD
wb
sorry my mom just came and yelled at me to go to bed I just wanted to say that hhahahaha and my ep just ended
also it's so awesome to have someone that agrees with me on almost everything thanks for keeping me entertained tonight haha
gnite

0720 minutes ago
07o3o
12What part of that scan says fire..../
the 2 new legends type are only dragon (from the link i posted for arti)
06WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH
06THAT CARD
06Zoroark is with Ho-oh
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
06maybe Ho-oh is in this movie after allllll
12What card..?
06the last scan
12Ok
06looks like movie cards
12Nah
12Oh maybe actually
12...
06omg zoroark/zorua carm necklace
06*charm
06want
12So what part ofthe can indicates fire for Reshiram?
06I'm trying to find that too
12As predicted, Reshiram is Dragon / Fire, standing 3.2m high and weighing 330kg, while Zekrom is Dragon / Electric, standing 2.9m tall and weighing 345kg.
06oh wait
12Thats on the news
nothing at all, perhaps light -> fire idk
06on the left side
12But where?
12Ok..
06there's a line of words
06I think one of them looks like fire...
12Is that definitely "Fire" ?
06but of course, I'm not japanese, I can't read it
06but one of the characters looks like it
12FFS I HATE Fire types that aren't starters
12and I HATE Reshiram being Fire, I dont want to believe it
12It's crap!
06I have mixed feelings
12What a let down!
06it's nice to have a fire/dragon FOR ONCE
06but not reshiram
looks like not all of 5th gen is fine afterall
:3
<shrug> - the guys that translate for bisafans say, they are both mono-dragon
06ice woulda have been better
12* Espeon
12dfgs
12ery

06that thing looks NOTHING fire type
o3o
07the tail
07o3o
12The tail isn't firey?
07if that doesn't look like a torch then I don't know what you're seeing o3o
12Actually yeh >>
12It does
06well it looks like a torch, but ok, a pure white pokemon being fire type
12LAME
12Rcsvylu
06heck, it's more blue than that
12*Exactly
12I hate that it's Fire.
06I always thought the tail looked like a torch
07it's just the eyes that are blue o3o
06but it also looks like an icy mist
06Kyu, the base shading is blue too
12Thats just to show shaded white however
12If you use grey to shade it, the white looks far less pure
07and all that red on him is....whatnow?
07o3o
06yeah but, it looks more cold
12Yes but Zekrom has the red too
12It's just an outline
12Yeh it does look more cold but also more pure :3
07not the outline
06ANYWAYS IT LOOKS LIKE AN ICE TYPE FFS
12Oh?
06if we exclude the possibility of a light type, it looks ice type
06...

Nothing
06woah people were talking about me lmao
=O
4yup
I am complaining about bp
Indeed ;D
Bye everyone!
yeah, Aurora
you're so popular
XD
02That's because we love you
06<3
12kyu
02o3o
xD
12you will never believe this
yeah, nobody loves me
12Aero posted
12:D
HOLY CRUD
IT'S A MIRACLE.
/me throws a party
I wish I could get into commissions D:
I needz the money for Uni
But I have no idea how to ._.
lol
06I just opened online commissions, seeing as I got some of my commissions done for people around home and such
Do you get much income for it?
Shiny forgive my potential stupidity: But what's the program you're using? o3o
02GIMP
And could I ask what program you use Aurora?
oh, thought so :3
06Paint Sai
06GIMP is pure failure lol
06and Photoshop, don't even go there
Never heard of that one o.0
i still need to get Sai just out of curiosity
06GIMP is the best for those who don't feel like paying though
06as it's free
lol as an artist I wouln't bash a program o.0
06...
and a program isn't automatically bad, if you spend time with it you can do amazingly well with it :P
06as an artist, I WOULD Bash a program
Omg the time..
06because I am cool like that, I have preferences :)
lol paying for pro- i mean hi
Quilava i don't know if you will know the answer to this question
I have to go peoples D;
but i'm going to ask anyway
06bye
bye
that is if you don't mind
Bye bye~
sorry nevermind
Photoshop I need to learn to use x.x
..uhmm.. ok?
i got the question answered already
And get
XD
4I like to use MS Paint and PSE ;3;
hurry and get back to what you were doing before zombies kill you D:
PSE?
02[14:22] <%Aurora> 06GIMP is the best for those who don't feel like paying though <--
I stopped playing that a while ago :|
4Photoshop Elements
I perfer Artrage
oh
i'm reading up on warwick XD
Warwick's strategy may vary from one to another, but it is known he is an excellent "jungler"; Many of the Warwick strategies could be easily adapted for any Summoner level, it's also one of the most common.
that's all I use but I need to learnt to edit images quickly with photoshop
i found that statement but couldn't figure out what "jungler" meant
4I've used Artrage, it just never really worked for me :/
ah
I perfer how it's more like using traditional media
i guess i like warwick only because he's a cuddly werewolf XD
opps o.0
lol.
Thanks xD
I still need to find a character I'm actually good with..
i kind of like Cho'Gath as well
http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cho%27Gath_The_Terror_of_the_Void
I should probably get going
Bye guys D:
02I is doing livestream hurray o3o
4:3
:3
4I would livestream, but you're livestreaming so I won't lol xD
by the way.. would you be up for a game? I'm bored <.>
i was going to start reading guides XD
oh
i really am thankful you want to play with me though Quilava
i told my other friends who play LoL many times
that i don't like playing games with people if i can't play them with at least one person i actually know
02Also Roara you're right, my school is lame *watched your livestream video the other day*
02Were you planning on it earlier Pokestar?
but meh
CR plays too
06wait what did I say about school?
i've played like 1 game out of all these weeks with them
06I forgot lol
i haven't seen CR talk in a long time
i don't even think he likes me lol
he's usually either on furnet or in PM or something.. or gaming
4Later on, I was going to start sketching out overdue requests
i see
14raaaa
I still say it's like complaining about a dog who got in a cage with a bunch of chickens and ate a few :P
i guess the idea of playing with friends and people i know is sort of a... fear though
It's just their nature -- their goal is to make as much money as possible and spend as little as possible
eh?
i don't want to be griefed by random strangers for being a bad player
12Raa :D
but a friend is less likely to do that
02You said that either some people were doing something at the time you were broadcasting or people were still in school, and then in a semi-whisper you said those schools were lame
02Kk Pokestar XD
14:>
I get that a lot anyway
06lmao yeah
meow
That's why you have ethics laws :P
/me hugs Azure and belly-rubs Espeon
And you enforce them
you have to ask yoursel
f
06well, I'm still savig the guideline tutorial for when you're available
Have you seen the BP spilled coffee video?
why do you even care if they think you are a bad player
Nuh uh
/me hugs back :3
It's hilarious
but the fact that it simply was put out is enough to irritate me
because they're annoying.
kinda loud though
Link!
and ruins my mood to play through that game
one sec
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM&feature=player_embedded
02Ah, well
lol btw
02The day you broadcasted was my last day of school anyways
the one time i played top base
14:3
i wanted to kill myself XD
06oh
06lol
4Yesterday was my last day of school lol
02(which was completely uneeded too, we sat around in our desks and just looked around wanting something to do)
top base?
i played like 30 practice matches with nothing but computers so i was used to playing bottom base
oh
you know there is 2 bases you play on
06well I'd do the guideline tutorial now then, but you're streaming already
playing as purple
i can't remember the colors
yeah that's a little crazy the first time
02Yes XD
06I'll have to find a day, but it'll probably be either tomorrow....or most likely in a couple weeks
i don't think i even got used to it through that entire battle
06because tomorrow is kinda my birthday lol
i didn't leave it either
/me has to draw you a picture then .-.
12C:
it takes a few games.
4o3o
LOL
:D
haaaaiiii
where did you gooooo D;
I was at friend's houses and on my senior trip and graduating D:
ahhhh
14^^
yeah
considering how many practice games i played
well i wanted to practice match with every character i could
just to see who i felt like i clicked with the most
you know?
yeah.
i was told not to do that
because computers are stupid but still
it doesn't matter if you are playing against a 3 year old or an expert who has played for 20 years
you are going to get a feel for the champion either way
yeah.
I still suck against bots <.<
12Too much black text
12:U
latelunchbrb XD
03o.o
/me shot
14lol
Azure stop talking we need more black text now
12XD
4k
did you see my sumo match?
12Pfft
the one i mentioned
14nope
i was playing dbz
and was playing world tournament with putting myself as a random character each time
first round i get stuck with android 19

12XD
06arti
06I have skype now lol
12the only musical i ever liked was "Little Shop of Horrors"
12What?
12Why not TeamSpeak?!
14I am grey!
want to play a practice game?
06because everyone else I know has skype :O
teamspeak? o3o
03I am greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen.
14LOL
12XD
02I don't
12teamspeak is boring
12always pick the worst of the two
12that is my rule
12:D
06by everyone else, I mean people I knew in school and went on to college
02ROARA
02Your gallery
06what?
12But everyone on TST has TeamSpeak!
12not me
06well
06like I said
12http://www.lugia.us/tst-teamspeak.htm
12See that
they do?!
12Well a lot of us do yeh
12i "had" teamspeak
we do? since when? :P
06MOST people I'm willing to give my number to has skype
12XD
:P
I just have both though t
I hardly use TS
12you don't have to give a number to anyone on TeamSpeak, it's multi chat, it's like IRC but you speak to each other all at once
02Yes I did
06AND WHAT THE HECK
12and you can talk by text as well if you want
12brb
02I even commented D:
06Arti your gallery hates me
D:
not right now
XD
too much going on
ok
!floof
/me flooooooooofs all over Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"
10!espeon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 7 minutes
Quilava
http://www.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=68225
i've had this bookmarked for a long time XD
12Mmmm?
neoooon
HURRRRRR
06it wont upload any of my files
for the record I only do that when I say something dumb or obvious :P
12Whats it saying now..? >v<
06wait
/me does the math
10o-o
06ooooh I think they're too big
4lol
Who said anything about you?
06unless this image doesn't work, then it's a problem
06oh yeh...it was size
06nevermind then
/me hides.
well you got "HURRRRRRRRR" from me I assume
and skype is multichat also P:
12You have to invite people in..
13That !Floof script should work on me too LOL
Nonsense. It was entirely my idea.
still multichat.
ok
12It starts off as no chat at all, whereas on TS you just connect and you're in with everyone
12Like normal chat
12and you don't have to give your IP to anyone Ovo
/me can't use TeamSpeak :<
You stole it from me, in fact.
is that such a massive inconvenience?
12You sure? It's not resource heavy or anything
and how are you supposed to connect without the server IP?
12Um, the server IP.. not YOUR IP
Yes, I've been in multiple skype partays now.
14I've used it before, but the sound card on this doesn't support micropohones :\
ok
10it is programmed to work for anyone
12Same bloated shiny crap which lags
12TS is simple
02I'm crap now?
12you connect, you chat, thats it
/me is shot
12LOL!
ok
10not just for the Espeon :P
13I mean, when I do the !floof it should switch off who floofs
lol
lol
10hm?
13Nvm, forget
14Yeh :<
13it, My brain is wacked
sigh Quilava
i haven't fully understood runes
i know what they do but i don't understand how you get them
PS wants your floofscript
12Not forgetting one very important feature of TS
13Yes lol
12You don't have to broadcast 100% of the time like a phone!
14It's awesome end of!
12o.o
12You can just press a button when you want to speak
she wants to be able to respond to !floof just like Sky
/me flooooooooofs all over Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"
12That way, less bandwidth used, less lag
you can also just press mute on skype.
and she should get to do just that
>:3
10nu D:
10no stealz
12Yes but you'd have to keep going to the mute button wouldn't you?
skype doesn't use bandwidth while muted or not talking.
06well I'll get teamspeak too I guess
/me steals it
12If you use TS, you don't have to be focused on the window to talk or not talk or whatever
13!Espeon
12Like I set my "talk" button the the middle mouse button and whether I'm browsing or gaming, I just hold that down if I want to say something
so? you don't on skype unless you want to talk to someone off skype
12You just said you have to hit mute to not broadcast..
12So that means you have to switch to the window every time you want to say something, otehrwise you broadcast 100% of the time!
to not broadcast when there's something to broadcast
Skype only broadcasts when there's an input
12Yes but are you really going to hit mute on Skype every time you want to talk and then stop talking? every single time??
What I miss <.<
>.>
you only need to hit mute if you want to mutter to yourself or speak to someone not on skype
12Umm
12Nothing
12o.o
12Then all the rest of the time, when you're in a chat, you're broadcasting 100% of the time
No you're not.
12Why not?
12x3
Unless older versions of skype are majorly flawed
12oh
12that
03!steal
12you mean
12So .. when you're connected to someone on Skype..
12derp
12XD
03!steal
03!steal
because Skype is more sensible than that and only broadcasts if there's an input above a certain level
Lol
12Isn't it like a phone?
03wtf
/me failed
06arrrrrrrtiiiiiiiiiii
12:U
12You mean a certain level of volume?
a dead mic results in no broadcast
06have you seen my new art?
/me forgot how to do that
13!Espeon
A certain level of microphone input/volume, yes.
13It ran out LOL
!steal
to eliminate buzz
12o.o
06........LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
03!steal
06This is so amusing it's so stupid
12!steal Azure
12Yeh that IS new to Skype as far as I know, because when I used it, when you were connected, you were always streaming sound
12Even background sound
/me doesn't know
12Just like a telephone
2hey, its the blue burd
2^-^
/me steals Azure for lots of fun. :3
12But still, I'd much rather just press a button when I want to broadcast, otherwise Xai might walk in talking to me and that would be picked up by the mic !
12XD
12Roara, will check soon
06also, having fun with the wrapped gallery -> http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/9990/lolskdfjs.png

04AHA
04that proves that girls can rape boys
12no one said we couldn't o3o
/me hides moar
04my friend (she's a girl) and I were debating if a girl could rape a boy
12its possible
Yes.
04she said that it is impossible whereas I said it is
12since boys get hard even if they don't want to o3o
/me SHOT
04she wen't 'but that is sorta hard to imagine'
Since when do guys not wanna be hard
04went*
04I go 'Use your imagination'
04she just 'B|' at me
04and LOL :LL
03hm, they're gonna give me a new card with an entirely new number
04LL*
Pay no mind, no one special here...
03which is fine I guess, I don't have it memorized anyway XD
12with WEAPONS
/me Idk
04if we are being assaulted by a really hot girl we do
Psh

no, go away
04:3
lol
/me on Fedora now :3
/me waits on hold again
04lol
The answer to can a girl rape a guy is simple though.
You can't rape the willing.
04lol
12='(
12and if the guy ISN'T willing?
12there are few who aren't willing
when has a guy ever said "Nah, I don't want sex."
04like me IRL
04no joke
04I have STANDARDS IRL
12I know someone who doesn't want sex
04I'm not gonna fuck this random girl I see if she asks me
your no one special why should we care
04well that eliminates you from the picture LL
/me flees
If a random girl asked me for sex, I would probably say yes in a half a second.
12o.o;
If a random guy asked me, same thing.

/me has visited more than a few times in its life
/me dies for abridged reference
Lol, just like last time
12the South has gone south, then...
/me shot
yup
No, its gone west
Wow, I still can't believe you worry about trolls at all.
I remember last time they thought I was will francis and not the chick
then east and then south
That's basically letting them win.
dari I'm just being careful :P I don't care if they feel like they win just as long as I feel safe about it
all that matters to me
12north west east south, past your lips into your mouth?
/me eats the south o3o
/me sings the Song of the South
/me then prods Disney for never releasing that movie >:|
dixie land? d:

Why is SR pissed off now?
Long story short, I made a joke and he got offended.
12Liiiiiiiiink <3

Thought I was trying to get "revenge" for a slipup he made in another channel.
/me puts LL in Dixie land

/me sends Dixie Land underwater! >:|
I love how girls/women always call things girly.
yeah and you know the girl I was talking about? she's "diagnosed with depression" from, not even at school, but "ONLINE BULLIES". REALLY. oversensitive people do NOT belong on the internet.
the land of cotton? :P
=/
12the land of cotton has gone soggy o3o
I hate how people think being diagnosed with something gives them a free pass to act like a retard
Lol.
12Deku Link and the BUTT TRUMPET o3o
I agree.
07I'mma peadge :^
"WELL I HAVE ____ ______ SO DON'T GET MAD AT ME"
I have been diagnosed with ADD and depression, and you'll never hear me use either as an excuse for anything.
/me torch
/me peadge!
/me peadgepeadgge!
/me lights butt
07-g :^
/me does furry stuff?
/me uses ICPM?
06the floof
He uses "autism" as an excuse for being... the way he is
06it burnsssssss
*he
*ICBM
yeah
06ok wth
Yep
Yeah.
06my stepmom said she was going to blockbuster
06she's been gone 45 minutes
and he's just fine
02Fff, no Absol tonight
Exactly
inb4 EW BLOCKBUSTER
12did you ever say he removed the shield? XD
07decision problems?
And you never see him complain about it
/me crawls into his bed and falls asleep
I respect him a lot for that
you wouldn't even know
06hey
12in the post
07it was kinda assumed since it was a duplicate that made the shield
/me tucks Shiny in
Lol dari
07and dragorie killed it o3o
06my wrist makes funny popping sounds
Very true
12sleep well Shiny!~
06like in drake and josh
12i don't make assumption
12s
02The ironic thing is that I HAD two shiny Absols
Reshiram: that show was old XD, so it makes it like drakes?
02And I traded both away
06looooool
12because they can be wrong
06yeah I flap it back and forth and I feel/hear it pop
mhm
07in any case if the shield was still up then you'd be aiming at nothing since dragorie got rid of the duplicate o3o
02Well, I'm going to bed now, cya tomorrow most likely
12night Shiny~ ^w^
12just because a duplicate does something doesn't mean it magically goes away after it gets destroyed
12that's like using a paper airplane to kill somebody XD then burning the paper airplane to ashes to revive them
/me squeaks
07that's a terrible analogy o3o
12how you kill someone with a paper airplane, don't ask
07by that logic that would mean that since dragorie killed the duplicate, no one's hurt anymore
07o3o
:3
07:^
yup
He is
12o.o
12i can continue this
12but i'm just going to redo my post
12even though all that post pretty much might change now
I have a lot of respect for people who don't give a [censored] what anyone else thinks about them
07besides, all you have to edit out is "the dark shield" and replace it with 'Tomai'
07o3o
12i did that move
12because of the dark shield
:3
12if the shield is gone i have no reason to do any of that
/me just silently observes everything ^^
07k then o3o
:D
Haha.
/me slowly walks back into the room
12i got to think it out
12my options were limited to 2 things regardless of what happened
/me yawns
12ok, this is horrific...but REALLY funny! XD
In any case, a few days from now you're all going to see this cool new thing I'm working on, and you'll be like, "Wow!", and it'll be so awesome that you'll forget all your troubles
...XD
07and Glacy hasn't struck yet XD
12i'm being in character
12give me a break >_>
wut
Will it be so awesome that my head explodes?
Probably not *that* awesome
12eww chocolate
Aw
07:^
I wanna see some heads explode
I dunno, you might want to see a doctor before hand if there's a lot of pressure inside your head
07''>
07hm
12can't i just say i did that action before dragorie killed the duplicate?
/me takes the Kit Kat and eats it
lol
Don't want to take any unnecessary risks
07nah :^
Looooooool
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI19H0nVDT4&feature=related and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH7yoLMExNw&feature=related
07uh
07that would involve moving you post ahead of mine somehow o3o
12not really
06gonna go now
12the action takes place in the middle of your post
06be back later
cya Reshiram
12after tomai expands the barrier
12but before dragorie kills the duplicate
ow
lol
delayed reaction
hii LL~
12why did I JUST realize how haunting the Deku Palace music sounds? o3o
/me is looking at pictures of new Pokemon for the upcoming games
Some of them look really weird
Apparently they're mainly crap.
12why does deku palace sound familiar
12Zelda Majora's Mask
I don't like the starters or the legendaries
Or Zorua/Zoroark
07why not just use that magnifying thing regardless of the lack of the barrier o3o
But some of the others they've just released seem OK
12oh
12the idea is that with more light in the area
04back
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4MjPvB0VF0 <haunting somewwhat o3o
12-w
12wb Lyon~
04back
12there is also less dark energy for tomai to manipulate
04ty LL
12wb
04ty LL
12making his dark energy weaker, however since he also controls light it makes his light attackers stronger
12but i can also eclipse the sun to make it darker
07o3o
12i don't want you to say r
07I was thinking he was trying to do that ant-laser magnifying thing that kids do XD
12"it's going to work" or "it's not going to work"
12because it's just a theory
12well the magnifying glass can also blind him and stun him a bit giving him an opertunity to attack but that was the main purpose lol
07so just switch it to that o3o
12don't you think that's already what i'm doing?
07I don't assume~
12right now i need to think to myself "what do i want to get attacked with, light or dark?"
/me RUNS
12i think this is how i can irritate Tomai though XD
OWWWWL
sorry, I was eating
THE OWLS
?
Hoothoot :O
THE ANGELS.
/me shot
07also
XD
07that's not how his power works o3o
12i said not to say that
12now my mood is ruined and i don't even want to RP anymore XD
07:^
12i wanted to figure out for myself in RP not out of it
o3o
07but if it worked that way you'd be messing up Kyu and Dragorie's fighing style too :^
12the thought has came to my mind
12which was why i was irritated with those two showing up
12XD
12i had this idea thought up before that post
12that you made all the villians so it'd take a large amount of characters to defeat them so that is impossible
Hey Jinx
07that's why the group is supposed to work together o3o
07teamwork! :D
12there isn't even a t or an e
12aha
12but from hearing the word instead of reading it
12it can easily be mis-spelled with an i
12:P
12Glacimr
07glacy*coughteamcough*mr
/me flees
blahblahblah
YAY
12but the i looked weird so i replaced the i with a y hoping people would still know to sound it out correctly
12i was wrong
I DIDNT DISCONNECT
04uh helo
04hello*
07by teamwork I don't mean that everyone has to order each other around o3o
04lol
12it absolutely irritates me when people say "Glacy" instead of "Glaci"
04Glacyme does order people around though
04like Key
07just attack in sync with others to find openings in his defense ot something
/me hides
12glacyme
12XD
hm?
12the situation hasn't gotten important enough yet
04lol
07that's what I mean by working together ya dip
07:^
12glacy wouldn't see it as such though
12he'd see as it taking advantage of a situation, not really teaming up with someone
07same difference
12well
12there is bad teamwork, and fantastic teamwork
12the two differ a lot
07well a good fighter has to be capable of fantastic teamwork in situations that call for it
07especially if it means the difference between winning and losing
04even if that fighter dislikes those he is working with
12that is quite true
12no one is perfect though
04yes
12somewhere along the line there has to be a weakness, weather it is in their powers or... their mental abilities
12there is some weakness in his powers, mainly elemental weaknesses
12mental wise he is really cold which is perfect for wartimes
curse you dixie land!
12however he always feels like he needs to do everything himself or not at all
/me is offended
/me shot
12right now in DRP
12heck he would of saw the fight and fly away thinking everyone else can handle them
12even if he knew that wasn't true
12that's why i nickname my characters as the rp mood killers XD
04well
04he would have been better as an evil character
12he's neutral really
12he's not a good guy but he's not evil either
...
04hey
12hi
Hi
12i dunno Lyon
Who might this be?
12recently i've been finding it REALLY hard
12to lead my character through the RP
12because he keeps getting jipped into doing things he normally wouldn't do
04:|
04maybe make a new character soley for the RP
04I made Drake and Selena for the RP only
12let me explain something
What's going on here?
12because this is the way i love rping
12i love rping with that mental mindset
04ah
04I see
Oh
Rp
04I enjoy using a variety of mindsets
12i really don't like acting selfless and outgoing
04sure I normally have a character with a set mindset
04but I still try and bring variety
12having a character like key
12would rip me apart inside so badly XD
04there is nothing wron with that
04wrong*
04and lol
/me burns dixie land for no apperent reason
12right now Lyon

/me hides
...
12you must always treat the guest kindly D:
/me gives you 5 luxray lv. x
12luxray GL lv. x
:DD
12would you believe this guy at our league
/me dances like a fool.
12he is so darn lucky
12he's done this 3 times
What guy?
What did he do?
12where he'd get 3 random packs of Rising Rivals
12and would pull a luxray X out of them
12it's extremely irritating
12those 2 aren't really good though
Comapred to gl x
12really the new set only has like 3 or 4 good cards
12there is Judge for starters
12entei raikou legend is REALLY good
12i know a couple people who play it in their luxchomp
I've heard
I don't think anyone at our league plays a lux-chomp. There's only one gl x at mine.
12the midwest has too many good players
12i would love to move over there XD
12Pooka lives in wisconsin he's last years US National Champion and won our regionals this season
12Ness lives in Wisconsin, he's won worlds 3 times
12blasted Jay lives in Iowa
Where are you in all of this?
12he placed 4th this year at worlds i believe
12somewhere in the high spot like that
12i live in wisconsin
Personally, I'm happy that I can actually play and not lose every time in western NY.
Need this movie
12i'm never going to win a tournament in this location
12i'm always going to be outplayed
12or outlucked
12Marriland

02D:
12but Kyu sure would know him
/me is away: going out
/me is away: going out
12he lives in Illinois
02GOING OUT
What movie?
Try some other place.
Western NY doesn't have many tournaments, though. At least where I live.
I know him
XD
Irony
12wb
12why is it ironic?
...
04cya
/me is a board

:P
Read
12reading is boring
Cosmic rays are the nuclei of metal elements, the very atoms without the electrons, expelled at nearly light speed from certain kinds of star. Their mass and speed give them very high energy, enough to penetrate all the solid rock above the platform.

06my favorite- ditch the gyms
something
2I still have a Lugia as my wallpaper on my laptop o.o
I didnt pay much attention
2I have not changed that in *ages*
03I still use a DigitalBlasphemy wallpaper
03and have no intent to change it
/me peadge!
12My least favourite, ditch gyms and three on three..
03ditch gyms, what?
12My favourite, none really LOL
12Go read the topic!
03my favorite: don't buy the new crap and stick to the old ones
/me hides
BREAKFAST
03nah, I'll buy them since I'm a collector
03but yeah
HOT CHOCOLATE

:DD
2Arti
2I love my old 6 on 6
06you don't want to ditch the gyms either?
12No
/me was SO excited to read that one
03gyms are epic
06gyms would be nice to have, but we need a game NOT centered on them
03PMD
/me hides
2I still say Clair and Sabrina are my favorite gym leaders
06Clair and Winona
2Clair litterlly mopped the floor with my face in Silver version when I versed her
'night everyone~
2the first time
06I actually destroyed her in Silver version
2and night Aero
bye Aero
D:
06took absolute ages to win in SS though
2I hated Sabrina in EVERY version
03the teenage witch?
/me hides
07she's at least 20
/me runs
2her Alakazam kicked my butt halfway accross the gym every time I versed her
03anyway
2until I used Lugia
03I should probably go to bed now
06Whitney and her bloody miltank
06and the fact I always had male pokemon
2urgh
fine go to sleep drf miss an all nighter :P
2bad memories
2her miltank hit my team like a truck
03so anyway
03off to bed
2and SS made it worse
06...WOW
06That....made my day in the weirdest way
06a friend who I really don't know if I can call a friend, more of an aquaintance, texted me just now a happy birthday message
2nice :3
06I'm like "you actually knew that?"
12<Reshiram> and the fact I always had male pokemon <---- haha same
12I got it in the end after about 20 minutes
06male pokemon like me more
06I never got along with female
/me runs
/me perches on Reshiram
2lol
12My Pigeotto got a couple of Critical Hits in
/me peck peck peck peck
/me peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck peck
06see, with females, I got the worst luck with status and critical hits and stuff
2urgh, my Geodude was the *only* reason I beat Whitney the first time
06I swear they hated me
12I just don't like females, never used them on my team
04wheee
04gonna go see A-Team tonight
12Makes it even harder trying to catch Pokemon with the right nature of course
2I never paid attention to nature
2just more attention to HP and Def and Spec Def
06oh arti you'l love this
06so I walked outside to my car real quick, and there was a peadge in the road
06it was just staring at me
12LOL
07:^
07was it me?
06I bent into my car to grab something, I came out, and it had walked like 5 feet closer to me
06and we kinda stared at each other
07:^
07:^
07:^
06peadges staring at you is one of the funniest things ever
everywhere*
Welcome to the internet :P

06their eyes are adorable
2lol
That's better than

07:^
mib_fheinfiefg is now known as newnick

lol
06yes

12 Hello, Things and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
06if you wake up and find that your entire room has been stolen, I swear it wasn't me
12^^;
2lol
2knowing Arti, she probably has some laser protection plus automized defenses that fire icebeams at people, not practicle, but the idea is cool
06ice beams have no effect one me :>
2:P
12hehe
2maybe an aeroblast canon somewhere >>
2MM
/me waves
12That rumour about Pokemon being created all at once and only being used now is creeping me out, reminding me of a dream I had about Zoroark....
THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
06wait what
06do tell
I love my dog ..... call his name he gets up looks at me, huffs then falls over xD
06you cant spew that out and not explain
like screw you women I am going back to bed
2lol
lol
2Roara has a point
12I will try to remember..
12Hey maybeI put it on the forums, doubt it though
/me checks
06the jist?
12Well..
12Basically I was looking forward to the movie.. then me and Xai were told by someone (cant remember who) that actually Zoroark will never appear in any movie, that it technically doesn't even exist.. and that it was actually a proposed design for a 1st gen Pokemon, then we started finding random evidence of this all over olds Pokemon merchandise >v< where shapes of Zoroark had been removed
12and yet it was still obvious what WAS there..
12Suddenly I was completely devastated by it..
06wow
12Damn me for not writing it down somewhere!
06that IS bizarre lol
2Arti
2it is a valid point
06I ADORE this pokemon
2they had sketches of Kyogre and Groudon well back when they were making Red
12really?
06Ho-oh was CLEARLY designed in the very beginning
2I believe so, as well as several other Pokemon from 2nd and 3rd gen, dunsparce being a prominent one
g'night
2and yes Roara
06I swear there was another one
06I can't remember which
12Which can be seen in the first movie :3
06no...I wanna say it was a 3rd gen
2I think I know which one you are talking about
12ARGH
06I can't for the life of me remember darnit
12Is it completely confirmed that Reshiram is FIRE...?
06Arti yes
07yes you wad
2oh, sweet
06I found the place on the scan that says fire
07stop hoping it isn't
12.....................
/me pokes Kyu
07THERE'S NO HOPE
12Kyu shut up
/me runs
/me pokes Articuno
/me kills him
12This is SO messed up
2o.o
2yeah
06they had a very early rendition of it
12I don't think I like Reshiram quite as much now, I HATE fire types..
06ugly
07it has a TORCHBUTT
06Arti, that's such a stupid reason though D=
06divine fire, bringer of light, still a heaven pokemon
12What?
06so what if it's a fire type D=
07Arti's just mad because IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE
/me flees
06well actually
06this eliminates the ice-type weakness
07that too
06but brings rock and ground
12:/
06I think fire is perfectly fitting
2if you look carefully at most of these third gen and second gens and look at some content from earlier eras, its not hard to piece together the ideas for half of these Pokemon
12I don't!
06even though I think ice would have been cool, fire is the best choice
12Wtf is the point?
Pride FTW
06wtf is the point of a plain peadge pokemon?
/me loves his kitty
06if we're gonna do this :>
12Thats like saying Beautifly looks like Butterfree so maybe it was going to be that originally..
>_>
2no, beautifly was actually a recent idea
/me gets out the wok
:O
12Yes but how can you say "Oh that looks like that so it was probably the original design"
chinese food anyone ?
/me pokes the chat
06well anyways, I'm not going to hate reshiram for the fire type, because actually thinking about it, it makes sense
2I will admit I am a conspiracy theorist at times, which is why I dont believe in conincidense
12Unless you can backup the Meowth and Skitty info with proof I won't believe it's anything other than people saying "Lol they look similar"
06just don't think of it as a normal fire type
Okies ^^
/me shares some Mexican food
12I still like it, but I like it less :/
2well Arti, they dont look similar, kindof like the relation between Politoad and Poliwrath
02o.o
07fire dragon and lightning dragon
/me pokes Drake
07put them together and you have
07me!
07:D
/me pokes back
2lol
/me is the 3rd pokemon >.-.>
07<.-.<
02:3
O.O
04:3
yup lol
2simply looking at concept art and making my own judgements
04How are you?
2just like any conspiracy theorist
2*runs*
thanks Proto :D
12..
06I like it moar
Fine, just no hurting mah kitty >:|
12You shouldn't give the impression that something is true when it's just your own idea.
hi arti o\
07k mirc is bugging me
04lolwhy?
12Thats what's wrong with a lot of the world
07my background randomly disappeared
12Hmmmm
07the white buuurns x.-.x
12Me thinks it may be time for a new background here..
12I've had the same one for years
06ok
04I don't use mIRC backgrounds
06I'm off to bed
04I just use solid colours.
06ollllllld
2well, if you look closely at Politoad and Poliwag, Poliwrath and Poliwhirl
2Politoad is the only one that looks like it should not be in the picture
04gnight Roara
07http://www.morenewmath.com/all/
2and dont get me started on Rhyperior or magnezone
07o3o
06in reference to your earlier staements
12Um yeh..
12Thats what I always thought...
06same here
I need to lay down for a bit later
06anyways
06night all
07better
2wb
12and Skitty doesn't look ANYTHING like Meowth..
12OMFGZ CUTENESS SPLODES ZG;STRKHF;D
2Nintendo still has some sketches of these newer ones dating back 10 years, so it could also be assumed they planned indeed on making more versions
*sigh* boring morning..
12LOL BOTHER
hm?
12YOUR NAME
OH XD
12LOOOOOOOL
07well of course they were planning on new versions lol
2BOTHERED!
now I'm going be such a pathetic fan XD
"*sigh* everything is SUCH a bother"
/me shot
02o.O
07making more theoretical pokemon than the number that is going to be picked is something that's part of the process
12OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE IM GOING BACK TO MY PARENTS HOUSE IN TWO WEEKS!!!
2o.o?
we can't believe it either
for we never knew
I feel better with this name
2for not knowing
07no respectable game maker makes a single idea of something and sticks with that idea until the final version
you blame the union?
/me runs
/me throws a brick at Kyu
/me eats it
/me turns Kyu into a PEADGE
12Well apparently the new starters were under development for months!
07exactly lol
12Thats a lot more than I ever imagined for designing new Pokemon!
02that's not me
2I still disagree with the pig and clown
/me was in the making for months. Unfortunately he still isn't as good as the previous ones.
07that doesn't seem long at all
04ovo
2but the grass snake looks alright
04meh
04treecko
2 am
04Tsutaaja
12WHY IS IT A SNAKE?
04same thing to me

12 Hello, Things and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

7ARTI
I'll be bringing my DS to the meet lol
7I've been trying to talk to you for four days. :P
12Hi
12Lol
7Multiple things; sprited that peadge pokemon for you. :P
7Ah, you've seen?
12I saw and already commented lOL
7Other things, may I PM?
12Yes
/me flooftackles Arti randomly :>
12XD
^^
12Sorry for silence, a bit busy
No probs
I'm feeling kinda k.o.
12k.o? ovO
feeling like I ran around five miles yesterday in the office due to problems...and I emptied my mobile phone's battery twice due to endless-calling
12Gah I really should go soon..
12Lets see..
12Need to make potato salad, have a shower, hoover all the rooms, tidy, put all the washing away.. all before 6pom
12*6pm
12sdfsdthty
four hours is very fine for that
you can hoover whilst the potatoes are boiling and maybe tidy up a bit, then take the potatoes off and let them cool down, finish tidying up and putting the washing away
then cut the potatoes, finish the salad and lean over rest a bit. Pretty easy :)
12I also would like a nap ^v^ I have been up since 6am ish ¬¬
12But I'll take your advise
12The entire house needs a hoover really..
12Usually takes ages
12Got guests coming ^^
I'll be back later (maybe, depends how long i can steal my mums laptop XD)
you need a better vaccum cleaner then ;)
12Lol, it's a big house and that includes stairs and bird seed everywhere XD
you should stick with eating at only one place in the house then Arti :P
12XD
I think I'll take a look at our rules and work at them, maybe add some paragraphs and shorten others - once I'm done I'll give you what I have, k?
12Yeh sure, just make sure you don't accidentally update the rules page :> I don't have it saved LOL
Arti - I have one golden rule: NEVER work at the original, ALWAYS do everything on a copy of a copy
this way I have still a clean copy of the original to compare the last state of what I was working at and something I can mess up without worrying me or others
12I have that rule too but I can't always follow it
12Like right now i don't have a recent enough backup of the database
12It would be nice to have auto backingup every evening -v-
reminds me of setting up a cron job on my server to take automatic backups. Will do once I'm finished with some other workings
12Would you mind setting one up on my server? :>
I have my computer set to backup automatically
Every Saturday midnight
we're talking about the server's database. That's a little bit different
even if the server takes a backup itself, what happens if the server and its memory are broken, hm?
!define bouffant
-!- a woman's hairstyle in which the hair gives a puffy appearance
7o3o
Hmmm.
!define SAN
Get an external hard drive or something?
That's what I do for my computer
...
I know
12What do I need an external for then/
12lol
You don't have access to the physical server?
you've never worked with any server bigger than your own computer case, have you?
12Of course I do
12To be honest, it's not hard to backup TST to my computer manually but it's a pain
like I said: A cron copying TST and especially the database on a daily basis into a shadow database on another server
I'd rather it be copied into a hard drive
Just hard drive
Not another computer
nonsense
Or something like that
if the server dies, the harddrive is gone
12We're all getting mixed up here..
What if the server and the backup goes kaput?
...
Zero, admittedly
lets take it one step further - what if every storage unit in the world goes kaput at once?
jk
But, you really want to minimalise worst-case scenarios
Large companies store backups not on servers but on tape drives for a reason
You see what I'm going on here?
we're not in the 1980s anymore Eon|Zzz
gah
Espeon
12LOL tab fail!
12LOOOOOL
bleh
i know xD
12XD
12Too many E's
indeed
12Why am I still here? XD
because you love us
12I DO
Yes
<3
most is saved on SAN systems - multiple systems in different locations
So what do you suggest
For backing up a server
as I said: A server being physical and regional independent from the original server
I don't know if that's possible for Arti
12Well
that's what I said I'm up to do
12It is sort of..
simple
12my computer would be the server
12But I have no idea how to set that up
12Never done it
12But thats what I want to do, have the site backup to my system automatically
12and eventually get spare hard drives and setup a proper backup system for my system XD
I said I'd build the backup system. That's just a program performing the action. Just a script. It's not important WHERE it's run, but it CAN be run at any place
like on my home server, on another root server, on Arti's computer
Good
it's just another MySQL-database which performs a Server-Server-connection and synchronizes the database every evening. This way the impact in affected records is minimal and - if the main database should die - the original can be restored completely within a matter of minutes
if you save everything to a harddrive...well....databases don't work like that
try to print music into a book -> same problem
12Er..
12I can save my database as a zip file or whatever
12Why can't I setup the server to do that automatically..?
12Or is that something I have to do manually?
12Like I said, not a big deal, just annoying
because that's nothing else but a database dump. But this dump will fail once the database reaches a set size
12Though during this entire conversation I did backup all of TST's databases
12What size?
12It's never failed for me so far
12I think we're at over 50 Megs lol
that's what I encountered whilst trying to backup a huge MySQL-database once before
12How big?
120MB
12Wow!
12There's a chance TST may become that big but I doubt it for now :3
failed because the Select-command from the database to dump ran into a predefined and hardcoded timeout
12Um
well, I'd like not to plan for today, but for tomorrow you know ;)
12I just checked the size of TST's database..
12It says.....
12482.64 MB!!!!
12Ovo
nice
12I could swear it was only 50Megs the last time I looked LOL
12Maybe I'm wrong, not sure..
you should look after if the sql-file you downloaded (the sql data you download is nothing but structurized sql data) is the same size, too
12It should be fine
otherwise you might have the same problem like I had. The dump I had once was cut somewhere in the middle of the data stream
that's why I prefer database-direct-connections
12I have tools to deal with that come to think of it.
12:>
as I said: I'll try and code it. This way it will make a full and executeable copy of entire TST onto your harddrive - or a flash stick
well yeah - I'll bring an USB flash stick with it installed onto the next time I visit you :)
12XD
12I gotta go now for real XD
12^v^
12Seeya soon

12I know, Arti :(
/me can no longer be sure what gender suits to describe said kitty
/me huggles
12I'm gonna have to stay this way for a few days I think..
03how come?
12does it have to do with what happened earlier?
12Family member knows where to find me
12oh?
12What happened earlier....?
o.O
12I meant with Pokewalkercheat
12No lol
03why don't the admins just ban him
/me Arise Huge Country, Arise for the mortal fight! (Brother)
03if he's being such a problem
12He IS banned now
12they did
03oh
12<late>
03OK
03so what is there to be mad about o.o
12Nothing....? Thats why I asked
/me murrs, removing his tongue and licking his lips enjoying the taste
03k
LL: PM?
03anyway, why demod yourself?
13:3
13I am everything
12Because like I said, family member knows where to find me and will see the ~ sign
03o.o
03and that's bad why?
03you don't want to own up to owning a chat?
12No..
12A member of my family is causing me problems ok?
12and so I've cut all contact with them, but they can still get onto the chat.
12That's why I'm hiding.
/me giggles, he had that look in his eye giving away that he wanted something else covered in her fluids ;3
03oh
7o.o
that is... terrifying
12and D:
hi LL
12<late>
Not really o3o
/me nods, blushing deeply
13It is
13That is why I am a God
12I figure if I just give it a few days .. if they ever turn up.. they'll just see I'm not here and give it up after a while...
I mean the fact that it made it look like you are everything. As in all genders. At once.
/me hides
13No
12o3o
03Or just ban them if they do show up?
13I'm a female god.
13But I am everything still
12-A
don't worry Zoroark - regardless what happens, we're on a watch here
12But that would only cause me more trouble :/
03anyway, speaking of problems with family... bbl, stupid parents are makng me do stuff >:|
12Zoroark
12can I call you Zor for the time being? ._.
/me smiles, laying her gently onto the ground, then climbing on top of her
yeah - enjoy your time with your guests and stay away from the computer
12Kay..
13I'm a goddess, you could say, but I am the most powerful goddess :3
I was also just solving the PWC (Pokewalkercheat)-Problem. So don't worry
12ty
hi Aero
12brb
Heya pplz~
12brb
kk
hey aero
12You know people on TST can say/do whatever they want to me and I don't generally care but as soon as a family member starts causing trouble, it's an entirely different story
12They're here gotta go
I know. Same goes with friends for me
o
k
13It's confusing

http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5596.0 <---

Heh
yeah - will talk to Arti when she finds some time regarding that. Maybe it's not the nicest thing you can do, but then again it's required, special a good thing for the community
Smite people!
/me giggles and moans suddenly as Psychic takes effect as well as her wet insides, his member quickly leaks pre-cum into her

The self-proclaimed Twilight dragon haz arrived
13Moar Eevee :U
/me sighs happily, fully relaxed as the pleasure begins to build <3
12XD
I DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT of Eevee's being just...

13No no no
13They don't fall from the sky

7Brb.
13That's why the grass is green, but its still me floof.
13And trees and brown, and the sky is blue ;3
this is equally calming and frightening
/me moans intensely as pleasure coarses through his body, his member now twitching within her opening
no way - I hate so eye-stealing animations
13It's all mine, but its still grass, and trees, and sky, and stone.
btw. what happens if an epileptic person sees that avatar, eh?
HOLY CRAP I just uploaded a picture to tinypic and the capthca challenge said "floofy the"
a lawsuit O:

hi Quilava :)
12>:U
12Everytime I start drawing on Photoshop, it wants to crash
hi
12But when I make graphics, it works completely fine
12</rant>
i want to try doing this so badly
apparently warwick is capable of killing the dragon at level 6
wb
Hey
huh
WarWick is a jungler
/me sits all over Aero
but i really have to as myself though Quilava
13Hey Kyu
what is the main point to killing those little camps in the maps
gives exp and gold to everyone on your team
oh
it gives gold to your entire team?
yes.
and experience
i didn't know that
same with turrets.
gives 100 gold to everyone
the same thing diesn't happen with champions though does it?
no
they give more, but just to one person
true but turrets are harder to kill
and are more protected
the camps though
i almost killed the golem camp at level 1 with warwick
if i used smite i would easily be able to kill him
hmm..
i tested it as well that if i can kill his 2 little friends first i can easily kill him if i take some time to recover after that
Hey!
Yes, my apprentice?
want to play a game?
Yeah right...
/me has nothing to say
i guess a game or two wouldn't hurt
just 1 on 1 then?
That's not how you should address your master.
1 on 1 doesn't exist
it's either 3 on 3 or 5 on 5
yes it does
Master? You're not my master!
that's just the maximum, you can start any time
i'm talking outside practice mode
you wanted to play a real game? :|
it occurred to me
just now that Warwick is of all things a team player
13gtg
if his first objective is to go for those little camps
Fool, what nonsense has seeped into your pathetic little mind?
you pledged yourself to me over a year ago.
6o.o
Yeah: o.o
1 on 1
You aren't my master you pathetic liar!
kind of does nothing for WarWicks main talent
rm. :/
this is the first time i actually understand how to play WarWick to some sense
i know i can pull it off without interferance
but I still suck :(
so do i
at least you have a character/strategy
my suggestion is look for a character
you like XD
yeah but
then read a guide for him
I'd need to buy them <.<
true :/
and I don't have many points
only like 2000 or so
i could of sworn there is a few characters you can buy for 2000
a few yeah.
I bought one for 450, but I suck with him
Then you truly are misguided. Memory lapses of this calibur are too much of an incovenience to me. Begone.
there is a lot you can buy with 2000
:/
the only reason i have so many characters
is because well yeah XD
i had like 50 dollars of reward zone certs
/me
wait you actually bought them?
that were about to expire
lol
its a .................. world out there
oh
Wow, so that's what I get for helping you?
6XD
so out of desperation i just bought the first thing that came to mind
/me impales Malefor with a spear.
before i was out 50 dollars worth of free stuff
6Finally..a new screenie
well.. I have to actually earn them, so it'll take time for me to get a good one <.>
You'll have to cut them all off at once, or they'll grow back exponentially, Malefor.
/me shields himself.
i bought 45 dollars worth of stuff for like 15 dollars lol
How can you do that while impalede?
*impaled
okay
why can't i open up the store
You have a grsily wound in your torso.
dunno
*grsily
*grisly
Damn keyboard.
That's impossible, my face couldn't fit all of those. :/
6Lol
Not to mention the time it would take to launch 100 spears without me moving.
i wanted to check the most expensive character
IP wise
6300 or so for a few of them
i dunno
i guess them my advice is to check all the characters who cost 2000 IP points or under
yeah
and see which one you like based on their abilities
7You're my apprentice!
Hit 100 time(s).
/me is confused.
/me uses Fissure.
you can get twisted fate
i kind of like him XD
7He still uses orange?
6Always.. :P
he seems kinda meh
Malefor fainted.
his special is really good
bbl
Twisted Fate reveals all enemy champions (including stealthed champions) for 6 seconds. While Destiny is active, Twisted Fate can teleport to any location on the map by using the ability a second time.
i win.
6Lolz
oh. wow
12i'm worrying more about the message XD
gtg, time for the last day of Korean school~
12and less about the grammar
12o.o
lol
Stupid computer...
6Meh.
No shit.
I've been gathering logs of them for a while
Great fap material.
/me dies
07well I barely understand the message as is x.-.x
12xD
I have as much right, if not more, than yourself to be in here.
I wanted to save up all my money for runes once I hit level 20 <.>
/me shatters the door with a well-placed garden hose.
12hmm
07and I don't go into the future >.-.>
That's what I meant. :P
that's why i wanted to use twisted fate but he's just too hard
well i like all his abilities actually
7:O Not funny.
Sure it is.
stacked deck
How old are you now, 7?
(Passive): Every fourth attack, Twisted Fate deals bonus damage. In addition, his attack speed is increased and cooldowns are reduced.
07I wait for everyone to do their thing, then I react to it and wait for everyone that I targeted to respond
7 11.
6XD
pick a card
(Active): Cards flash over Twisted Fate's head one at a time - blue, then red, then gold. When he uses the ability again, he picks the current card over his head, and the card picked gives a special effect to the attack. Blue causes bonus damage and restores mana equivalent to the bonus damage. Red causes area of effect slow for 2.5 seconds and bonus damage. Gold causes stun and bonus damage.
7-.-
7O_O
Do you play baseball, Jonny
?
7No and who is Jonny?
7*No, and who is Jonny?
Anyone plays piano?
You are, silly boy.
Hey Jinx
7No I'm not!
12so that explains the expanding barrier that caught "everyone" in the area
7You are!
Dude, it's obvious that you are.
You have no support for any denial.
I'm obviously not Jonny.
7Who or what is Jonny?
I was addrressing Jonny.
*addressing
You are Jonny.
wild cards
(Active): Twisted Fate fires 3 cards forward in front of Twisted Fate in a narrow cone, damaging everything in their way and passing through targets.
7No I'm not, I'm Josh
*Jonny
i don't really care much for his innate ability
I had to correct you there.
7*No I'm not, I'm Josh.
the +2 gold?
*Jonny
yeah
07well if you're less than 50 yards away and can't fly off in less than a couple seconds, then of course you'd get caught in it
but it works for everyone on your team
i know it adds up
but still it takes 50 kills for an extra 100 gold
lol
/me returns
*Josh
/me returns o3o
No, you're Josh, correct?
07o3o
07!espeon
/me now belongs to Kyu for 10 minutes
7Yes!
Wrong, you are Jonny.
12you forgot how watchful glacy was being over tomai XD
6No, you are Jonny, I'm Josh!
You've got ti backward.
Alright, so you're not not Jonny?
6Whatever...
Answer the question.
/me 6presses the ignore button
07that doesn't change the fact that at this point you were still the only one unscathed
12oh well
12i have a post to reword
Are you not not Jonny?
6Aww..
6I was enjoying that.. :P
I just suck at strategizing <.>
Me too.
12i'm also the only one who wasn't involved in the fight until like now
07because like I said before, he mainly counterattacks o3o
Cynder: Tell him I ask him if he's not not Jonny.
07they'd just stand there
07XD
12a great warrior chooses his battles
12XD
12*wouldn't
/me 4unignores
6yayz
Malefor, just answer one question for me.
/me 4ignores
Are you not not not not Jonny?
07i meant theoretically ya wad lol
/me 4unignores
/me ignores Malefor
/me 4doesn't care
Tell him I won't bring him back until he answers my question yes or no.
4I can see what you are saying...
What'd he say, Cynder?
4Lol. I'm gonna ignore myself! XD
veiger looks pretty good. I just don't know if I'd be able to use him well
6<Malefor>: I can see what you are saying...
6<Malefor>: Lol. I'm gonna ignore myself! XD
4hey
4hey
Ah. Malefor, that's not an answer.
bbl
4Wow!It actually works!
07sure you will.
6o.o
4* Wow! It actually works!
6Oh]
12lawl
6You ignored yourself?
12yay i'm a wad
4Yeah! Try it!
6I've done it before... :P
/me can't understand why Malefor is too dull to understand a simple question and answer it.
4It's weird...
X3 'allo~
/me glomps Kipi
:D
/me 4says, "I'm not Jonny, I'm Josh, you are Jonny."
4Happ?!
12i reworded the post
4*Happpy?1
4*happy?1
o.o Eon... have we met?
Did he respond, Cynder?
4*Happy?!
6Ya
6Malefor says, "I'm not Jonny, I'm Josh, you are Jonny."
4Stupid computer!!
That wasn't a yes or no answer, Malefor.
/me 4says, "No, I'm not Jonny
He can see what I write, Cynder.
/me stuffs Pichu into the engine compartment of a Freaky Old Bus
6Oh
/me 4says "No, I'm not Jonny."
/me uses Thunder
I'll re-pose the question: Are you not not not not Jonny?" A yes or no answer is required.
i tried him i couldn't stay alive with him XD
/me prefers Clamato. :<
/me 4says, "No, I'm not"
4*/me says, "No, I'm not."
Sorry, wrong answer.
/me 4says, "No, I'm not."
Yes or no, nothing else.
yeah, I just haven't been here in awhile
4>_<
/me 4says, "No."
7Are you still the same Eon, personality-wise, as before?
/me wonders if Malefor knows that ignoring just means you can't see what that person writes, they can see what I write.
4I do no.
Cynder, has he answered in a while?
6Wha?
6To your question?
4*I do know.
Yeah, besides the answers you PMed me.
I just don't want to buy anything <.>
6Ya..Another No like 5 mins ago
:/
12o.o
:P
4If you did, then I wouldn't be able to see your typing.
then you got to make the most of your IP
6...
Well, at least he understands the question.
6lol
4>_<
Personality wise? No.
yeahh..
4>____________________________________________________________________________________<
<Malefor>: If you did, then I wouldn't be able to see your typing. Thanks, cynder. Malefor, when you ignore someone, they can still see what you write, you just can't see what they write. It doesn't work both ways unless they ignore you also.
Thanks :)
hey
/me chews on Eon
4I didn't ignore you, stupid.
/me gnaws on Kyu
/me unignores Malefor.
thanks though Quilava
I didn't say you did. The only way you can see what I write is if you didn't, so you just proved yourself wrong. :P
i didn't notice you can buy runes
4 0_0 Oh.
4?_?
And by Malefor i mean Jonny.
lol
Thanks for your assistance, Cynder.
save them for level 20 or so, then you can get tier 3 runes
6Lol
Ah, rude little one, eh?
i already have tier 3 XD
/me meows
you can't use it though :|
I think you need a time-out.
4*And by Malefor I mean Jonny.
4I think you need some grammer lessons!
o3o
meowww
You spelled "grammar" wrong. I think/you/ need some.
4*grammar
i'm using them right now
wait what?
07!espeon
/me now belongs to Kyu for 12 minutes
/me noms on Eon (Kyu)
don't you have to be level 20+ to use tier 3 runes?
b-sydes i cn argu leik dis if i wnt adn stil wiiiin
well i can put them into my rune book o-o
4*Besides, I can argue like this if I want and still win.
4Go to school, grammar face!
and they are adding to my statistics
5Hello..?
That was a contradicting insult, young one.
5Hi Kyu.
5^___^
4Young one? I'm in 6th grade!
You complimented me by associating me with good grammar, while at the same time telling me to go to school.
/me 6remains silent
Youth is a relative thing, Jonny.
/me 5is playing Gold -- yes, old-school Gold version -- right now.
4I'm not Jonny!
Whatever you say, Jonny.
/me watches with amusement.
6Lol same here
huh
4And I'm not your servant either!
Good problem-solving. Just stab me with a fictional weapon on the Internet. :P
well whatever :|
you might be right though
because for some reason they turn red in the book
well
the tier 1 ones anyway
tier 3 don't do that
I never said servant, Jonny. I said apprentice. You're benefiting under my tutelage.
oh, yeah.
Another imaginary killing. Bravo.
that mwould make sense.
ANYWAY I should play a practice game to get used to a new character
wow i'm so confused
you can join if you want
tier 3 are much more expensive than tier 1
4I'm not Jonny, I'm not your apprentice, and I'm not stupid!
they have better effects
6 3OGC
I've only called you two of those things.
okay
yeah you are right
I see this.
do you want to join me in a practice game?
nah
i'm messing with runes XD
6You guys should do this more often.. :P
4Oh, then let me call you this: You are stupid.
Are you not not not not not Jonny, then?
brb
ok
4If only I was on more...
i don't understand ANYTHING about runes XD
/me is playing Red Dead Redemption.
4I'm not not not not not Jonny!
:|
6Same here
the piont of the primary and secondary
So you are, then?
the tiers
i'm seeming to understand the different types of runes though
You're getting repetitive.
4I hope you know that I am a Moderator, not here though.
tier is strength :| pretty much
3 is strong, 1 is weak
6XD
That's cute.
primary and secondary?
So, anyway...
6I wish I did have popcorn irl.
what do you mean?
4We can rule the chat as Doofus and Josh!
you mean pages 1 and 2?
6Same here
in the book
First we'll have to find a doofus, and a Josh.
I don't know of any Josh.
the runes are listed as primary and secondary
it lets you have 2 pages set up so you can pick which one you want to use in a game
6Josh as in Drake and Josh?
Although you might qualify as the doofus.
and no clue
6XD
4Well we found the doofus, and he's talking to me right now!
5I wonder what everyone else is doing...
You're talking to yourself, Jonny?
That's a symptom of schizophrenia.
6Loool
4>__<
/me yawns
i'm going to find out
D:
12kyu
k
unless
12did you find my rewording satisfactory?
07ya
primary is what you can use, and secondary is what you're too low leveled to use
12ok
aloha Scaley Dragon ^^
Then who's we?
You and your split personality?
6If someone has the more/less than signs round their name does that make them the doofus then?
12o-O
12hi
Well, they could also be wearing the dunce cap, but either as sure signs.
12lol
6<8D
heh
12"Love truth, but pardon error."
12these fortune cookie companies are starting to run out of good stuff to say
4*earlier
Malefor, I have to say, you're not quite the worst n00b I've ever messed with.
6Someone who uses crappy grammar like that is a doofus.
5LOL, for sure.
/me is literally dripping sweat
6Therefore Malefor = doofus.
5Hi DRF! (:
03my entire back is soaked
03stupid cutting the grass
Haha.
5Fuuuuuuuuun.
4Stay out of this!
6Lol
What kind of stupid words, Jonny?
5I let my dad cut the grass. xD
12lol
03I get paid for it
07just your back?
07o3o
5I clean the house in the A/C and wash the cars and get paid for it.
that can't be it
because primary and secondary are red
4Nice try. I'm not saying the words so that I will be called a doofus.
03actually no, my front too
6I wants Pringles with chilli taste.. :P
03but my back is worse
That's not what I'm attempting, but okay, be paranoid if you wish.
5Wow nice mental image there. --;
03I should just jump in the shower
07how'd that happen anyways
07sprinklers?
It's another sign of schizophrenia.
5Uh, Kyu, maybe it's HOT there?
6I like pringles, but they have quite a lot of fat in them for crisps THAT size D:
Not sure, Cynder.
03no
6Indeed..
03sweat...
03it's not

It is also important to note that some runes are "primary," and others are "secondary," this currently is viewabale at the Rune Book, but not in the store. To have a primary rune means that this rune's affect coincides with its type (a mark giving a bonus to attack damage). Secondary runes give a bonus outside its intended use (a glyph giving a bonus to attack damage). Primary runes give a stronger bonus than secondary do (a mark giving bonus to

5Well, I got a grad party to go to. ><
5See you guys!
03bye
6This sounds stupid but what is sixth grade? Is that like year 6, pretty much?
10-11 years old.
6Ya
It's fine, I know you go by Yera X.
*Year
/me yawns

6...is Malefor really in 6th grade?
He might be a little yoiung for it. :P
6XD
*young
/me throws a pebble at you
But since when does he have moderately good grammar, though?
6He is fairly up himself despite how old he is.
6And the rubbish grammar backs up his ...sixthgradeness.
6Lol
Yeah. But now matter how above average you are, you can't surpass the maturity of your age fully.
It's like a genius 8-year-old reaching puberty early just because he's smart.
6I'm 15 but I still play with my sister like we used to about 10 years ago, I admit x]
6But hey, I'm mature in other ways
Lol, that's alright.
I have a lot of juvenile interests myself.
6Everyone has an inner 5 year old :D
Well, it
6Lol indeed :P

oookay I fail to see the relevance of that.

Just wait until they get older. some will realize their faults, and others will grow up embracing them. the parents will then raise kids just like them, only worse, and it will increase, as it has done for decades.

Burger King's Double Stacker

it's basically a double cheeseburger with bacon

at least it wasn't macdonalds.
Why not kick them both out?
we all know Burger King is better than McDonalds

Someone kick Malefor out so I can get back on as him!
XD
Clam down, young one.

starting another practice game soon

Clam?
hopefully I'll at least be decent
just kicking him out of the room won't work
I corrected myself, so don't even start.
I HATE Ryze bot

they suck as players too
if you see one, you're dead
Who made him quit?

It'll quit on its own, dude.

nobody.
Cool!

Now if only we could make the server make you quit.

what happened to your red text?
6o.o
Kidding...
'-'
It doesn't say anything now, thanks to you!
you're welcome :)
Soq uick to blame, Jonny.
Tsk tsk.
So now it is saying that I am not a him or her, but a what.
*so quick
Jonny, you're a neuter. didn't we tell you/
6It says you're an it http://wbe01.mibbit.com/smileys/yel06.png
Well, you better change it back to a him!
6And why are you fussed about whether it says if you're a he or a she?
12hmm
Jonny: That'd be inaccurate, you're neuter.
Because when I first went on here people thought I was a girl.
I wonder why?
^ Lol.
6When was first? A year or two ago?
6Lol DB
As soon as I logged on, before I even said my first word on here, someone said, '"Do you think it's a girl?"'
Hey jinx
6Today?
3 years ago.
6Ah.
they were probably just... spikey, Jonny.
6Random question : COD's like SWAT,isn't it?
6>.<
not particularly
lol
SWAT as in real life, or SWAT as a game?
6The game
Not too similar.
CoD is far more popular.
6What's the difference between them?
6I've noticed :P
I haven't actually heard of SWAT before
Well, SWAT isn't exactly military, they're GIs, so...
6Ah
There's a big difference there.
Probably cos I'm still playing all my PS1/2 and GBA games still :D
6Lol
6Woo
brb
Haha. You archaic gamer you.
6But otherwise they're both shooting and stuff,right?
Mhm.
6Ok :P
GTA involves shooting things!
6Lolz
6GTA pwns
Well, not THE Things
As does RDR.
6RDR?
I can't drive on GTA so how I'm going to drive in real life = inconceivable
Red Dead Redemption, another Rockstar title.
So hungry. :<
xD
6Lol
6Never hear of it
I can't believe we let that goal in!
The Saw game takes up 12GB on pc.
FAIL!
It's a Wild West game.
6o.o
The Saw game sucks.
6:O
It's just so awful.
I wonder if Cary Elwes will be in Saw 7?
It's possible. Maybe in a flashback.
6I need to continue SWAT.. -.-
Although I loooooove the series I'm glad they're stopping
6Why? o.o
Hohoho, I bet Dr Gordon is Jigsaws apprentice or something.
They have twomore sequals planned, right?
*two more
No, Saw 7 is the last.
Hopefully.
Yeah, hopefully.
XP I don't want to do these bounties anymore.
Five was the worst, but still decent. Six was one of the greatest.
http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/06/pokealbum.jpg
But the ending corrupted the concept of the series.
i'm actually going to try a real match
outside of getting used to your character
you don't really learn much more from practice mode
/me 6wonders why 20 people at a time change their profile picture on Facebook..
Wait, how is hoffman cast in VII?
*Hoffman
LOL
07lolpsyduck
someone is using that name
He didn't die in the end of 6, he only had his face partially ripped XDD
I know, but he's basically useless to the plot now.
He was rumbled by the people but I found it quite funny that he was framing Strahm
although he's sort of dead.
Yeah, the balls don't go in that side
/me points to the other end of the field
Mhm. I have to rewatch them before VII is released, however.
Saw spree!
We should have this match easy, that goal literally slipped in lol
Sounds fun.
The spin-off: Hammer!
Lol.
Oh, did the goalkeeper back into the net?
Last year I rewatched them all in one day, and enjoyed watching my friend freak out over them.
He gets frightened easily, and we were watchimg them all night, so it kind of broke him. xD
*watching
I tried watching all 6 of them with a friend one night, we got up to saw 4
No, he stopped the ball...which then proceeded to slip out of his hands and then role into the net
I read that as Spyduck
I fell asleep twice during 4 but then it was about 4am XD
Oh, heh
I've seen that before
:O
/me is covered in ashes!
/me brushes them off on Cube
Oh no...free kick against us
I stayed up all the way, finished 6 and said: Hm, X-Men now? :P
What's really horrible is when a goalkeeper catches the ball, leans back from the momentum, and dips past the line
*crimnges*
cringes*
But yeah, it takes a while.
YES!
We stopped it
=.= I don't want to do bounties anymore...
Indeed.

12xD
03I just never understood those people who watch sports and start shouting at their TVs
03like, seriously, it's just a game
And what if I do?
03watching sports is one thing... getting super involved is another
12Err.. it's fun..?

Do what i'm not planning anything
13And outline*
What is it Espeon?

12Yeah, don't do it. I epic fail at teh sexcs RPing
You'd get a shiny cyber if you do though.
/me is shot down
02If you saw me draw it, I'd want to know why you're stalking me .-.
/me 13stalks 8D
12DRF, I agree, people as a whole are stupid.. but some people would say you were based on their opinions
/me 13flees
02Espeon missed my voice though
02:3
oh dear D:
12Like me, I think you're stupid for not caring about your health
12But that's just opinionated
02You can always go to the old videos on my channel and look for the most recent one and listen to my voice
12and I say I'm not stupid at all for having a laugh with my friends and yelling at the TV
/me killed the convo D:
i know xD
02But there wasn't anything interesting I did in there .-. just watched YT vids
Brb
12and you're stupid for thinking it XD
How goes, Zoroark? :>
/me runs
12Fine.. I guess...
12Actually no
03it's one thing if you're just joking around
03but to actually get mad over sports
12Things are just terrible right now
03is another thing
Ah
/me winghugs.
12Why DRF?
Espeon
:C
12What makes people "stupid" for being passionate about something they care about?
<Azure> Yeah, don't do it. I epic fail at teh sexcs RPing <- It's easy.
Just bend backwards
Yes
12XD
03because it's just a game
/me runs
XD
12Pfft
/-\ <- Like this
13:U
12XD
WIN
Azure
And snap your back in half.
People can still be passionate about it
12err.. haven't you gotten mad at your computer before? You know it's just a computer right?
03XD
13I need to reoutline the page in PSE, since you're not going to color it
Just go "OH YES~" *moan*
/me RUNS!

Then, you raise your arms up
03I never pictured you as a sports person, that's all
12I'm not
\o/ -\ <- Like this
/me 13is searching for Father's Day gifts though
12But I'm having fun with my friends during the world cup!
02mmk
And you are now cybering.
wtf XD
12XD
12wtf indeed
12It's a social thing, it's an event that everyone recognises and can all join in with each other
12Its all about being proud of your country
03FINALLY my friend is coming over
03he told me he'd be here an hour ago!~LOL
03-~
12You're stupid for having friends :D
03and so are you :D

03any idea why you weren't showing on my Facebook friends list?
Arrrrrgh
03It shows me as still being friends with you

12Yes
/me runs

03but you just weren't on your list
hey
12I have deactivated my account

03oh
12Temporarily
03I see
12Same reason my name is Zoroark
03I can still view stuff on it o.o
12:/
03I was wondering that, like what happened XD
12What can you view?
03I thought maybe you de-friended me :(
03everything.
07well
03I just went to the TST Members United page
03and clicked your name
07she did that too
12Haha
/me runs
03LOL
12Well thankfully it's just TSTers that can see my name then :>
03XD
03did you just set it to completely private or something?
03I thought deactivated means they delete it
So Azure
You say you fail
Does that mean you like it tho?
/me dies
(I mean, you didn't say you didn't ;P)
12lol
Eh?
Anything happen?
13Man, do I feel great. Just got shot down by my mom >.>;

Deactivating facebook accounts generally can't be accessed.
/me touches :3
/me shot
/me fffffff
12XD
If they by some chance can be viewed (like me with Arrow), they're emptied out.
12I don't mind if the TSTers can see it, it's family I am trying to avoid
Ah
What's up bird?
I know someone :|
13I know, but if I order it online I have to use her paypal account so...
12Just got a really awful family member who attacks me all the time
12o.O
o.o
12Thankfully they don't have my phone number, so as long as I disappear for a while I can probably get rid of them.

XP Since when was bribery worse than murder?
Brother
what's more immoral? Shooting a cop in the facial region, or bribing him to leave you alone?
this just spells GTA IV, but really I dont understand the question
do you mean what is more immoral to do?
or how much is immoral the cop?
The first thing
also, I give Karate kid a 5.4
ah
hmm...
depends to who
10http://i968.photobucket.com/albums/ae162/KasukaHeiwajima/mijumaruatack.gif
it'd be "immoral' of you to shoot him if he wasnt the same racist scumbags who shot Kofi in Flordia
but thats a different story
it'd be 'immoral' of the cop to accept a bribe but then thats the police
10also, Espeon, you around?
they get more bribes then the mobs
Yeah, this is a completely irrelevant different story
did you play GTA IV?
or is this just a random question of morality?
RDR
RDR?
OH
Red Dead Redemption?
Yup, yup
Ah, then I'll say....
Which unfortunately has nothing to do with the first one
I hate this Fucking phone ><
both can be done, I dont have much care for the police of the west
The first one had funner boss battles
Also

/me is shot
Hello, aero
hai
:)
/me had dah guest an oreo
d:D-/-<]:
12no
/me crashes back in with several armloads of DECtape - "I hate open reel tape. I hate open reel tape. I hate open reel tape..."
O_O
How ironic.
what's that? a skateboarder?
*hands
Supposed to be
I just had one a second ago :p
I stole it from Things >_>
ah
an oreo? XD
>:>¤¤{
Yep
lol
o_O
/me wants one D:
penguin...if you can see colors and have a white background
12no oreo for yo
I currently have three reels of DECtape wrapped around myself... because apparently /le moron/ decided it was okay to not warm me of the power cord that is currently a massive tripping hazard.
I have a dark background and all text is white unless someone uses a color code :3
DDD':
Wow, this history book sure does have some opinions about things!
but I want dah coooooookie
/me raids the TBB ustream stash in another Internet, then repairs the 3rd wall he just broke.
Luckily; DECtape is durable... and evil.
Here's one, aero.
You mean something written by human beings is biased? *GASP*
:P
LOL! I just read "Oreo" as O.o but majorly typoed XDDD
iPod autocorrect :p
Hmm
/me accepts and noms
I despise tracked shipping
This book doesn't even pretend to hide it
At least it's honest
lol, every time I think of Apple, I think of DRF and how much he hates the company XD
heh
Well I don't hate apple anymore. I used to hate them a year ago.
"Off topic, but if I was going to Hong Kong I'd be getting some cloths. You can buy a tailored replica Armani suit for under $400, and they use the same Italian material as the real Armani costing $4000. You dont need to get a suit, but it gives you an idea how much money you can save, and get some phat duds."
lol ok
04Brb, need to go get my camera x3
So drf isn't the only technical person here.
IMO I know more than him.
dun tell him that when he's here XD
Oh I think he'll rise to the challenge.
06...
06hey, ha anyone seen price of persia?
06*has
No
lol, I know two people who have, but I have not XD
Aurora: not yet
but I did see Karate kid today
:O Brother see Karate Kid? XD
/me is shot
Yes
they totally cheated the bug scene :P
/me never got into the whole "OMFG Karate Kid thing"
I have, Aurora.
It was good for the most part, but the ending kind of contradicted the whole movie
kipi: what was the ending?
sorry, didn't mean to leave
internet crashed for a sec
lol
It's okay :P
A spoiler, Brother.
04Yeah, it did
13http://i50.tinypic.com/w6r0xg.jpg
hmmm
13Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee My T-shirt~
12O:
12Cool
/me is gonna go
ttyl~
13I spent like a week on it lol
12XD Wow
13It didn't even turn out as great as I wanted, but whatever
13I STILL <3 IT /caps
12:D
I just realised something
12What did you use to color it? o.O
13Fabric paints
12Oh O:
13I just went to my local craft store and bought some
12I dislike those
12XD
12Aah
12:P
13Well, the paint does't drip and smear like when painted on pictures and suck
13such*
US History consists of a bunch of crazy people
13It was like using markers with a brush
12Oh
12XD
They're all either crazy, or unethically taking advantage of the crazy people and getting rich off their stupidity >.>
13The fabric holds the paint better than paper :3
lol
12I'm used to using fabric markers for those types of things, but it'd be smart to use paints instead because you had to fill in larger areas. O:
/me uploads something to the Fan Art gallery
12Yeah, it does :D
/me watches DarkSider LPs
/me eats the birthday cake that's on her profile page
I mean, it's a consistant trend throughout this entire book
13I suggest getting a large and small brush for it. The small one to outline in and fill in the details, the larger one to just corver space with paint
04Yummy :3
04My Birthday isn't until August ;3;
06what day?
0417th
06cool
A bunch of crazy people are running around stupidly, some people figure out how to monetize the crazy people, and then you have a bunch of crazy people who think they're being crazy against the man, but they're really working for those rich people who figured out how to monetize them
04The sad thing is, that its usually the first week I'm back in school :/
12Yeah, that'd make most sense :D
yay democracy
:e
:3*
And then you have a slightly less crazy minority who seems sane, but they're only sane in comparison -- they're really crazy too
And then government oscillates between the two groups
/me hands everyone a history book so they know what he's talking about
I think it started after the civil war
PS: at least you dont go back on August 9th
I get to work outside for eight hours a day wed/thurs in 33c weather
\o/
04I get back on the 11th
04We always start on Wednesdays for some reason
Hehehe, I have disentangled myself from the reels of DECtape... and they still function perfectly. Overengineering, for the win!
/me thinks he wants to move to Canada even more now after reading some of this stuff
04http://i50.tinypic.com/w6r0xg.jpg *pokes link* I finally managed to get a picture of my shirt xD

04Okay, I was confused
12Tron is in Kingdom Hearts II o3o
03I mean, even us pro pirates can only get it a FEW months before
04That's why I was confused
/me runs faster
12brb
/me catches drf and holds him into court

03:O
OVER 9000 years of community service
03and you know, the bright colors in this movie kinda burn my eyes on my TV XD
04lol
03basically
03good guys are blue, bad guys are red
03there's also yellow but those are rare
tha so typical
03but their suits GLOW
/me SHOT

03as the minimum age for overnight was 9
03and 9 year olds watching Spaceballs = WTF
no it is FTW
/me shot
03XD
04Don't make 9 year olds watch spaceballs. That just doesn't work ._.
03on a random note
03we usually asked them to vote
03between about 5 different movies
Spaceballs is fun
she's right
you make 13 year :D
03XD
03well
03if our kids were all at least like 11 or 12, then we'd consider Spaceballs
03so random question
the lag here
kills me
03if you two guys eating dinner at a restaurant
03does your mind go "gay"?
04No
03because that's what it seems people do :/
No
03oh, good

03I love how everyone was using a command line operating system in Tron
everyone?
03well
even the air? P
03the people who use the computers
03it's command line
*;p
03OK wtf
04...
12o.o
03my friend said "I Guess..." when I asked him if the graphics in tron were awesome or not
03the CGI was AMAZING for 1992
03*1982
04That doesn't make sense Brother
03I mean, yes it's supposed to look digital
02!uptime
Uptime: 14hrs 23mins 46secs
The uptime of shadow.ambernova.net is 045days 2hrs 57mins 11secs.
03but nobody even knew what digital WAS back then :P
04Yeah
03the funny thing
04._.
drf: if itwas 1992 you'd be wrong :P
03I'm one of the few who didn't hear about Tron through Kingdonm Hearts
03-n
03I actually heard about it from Armagetron
1982, pretty good for its time
03when I was a camper at the place I taught last summer
02rofl
04I heard about Tron from my dad
03all the kids were playing this game called Armagetron
02Ben finally deleted GV
12wb lol
I saw Tron from sci fi
03which is basically a computer clone of the light cycle game
03and I googled it and was like ":O, it's based on a MOVIE?"
I wonder if its still even up..
03so I went and rented hte movie XD
04He played the Tron when he was young
03*the
03LOL talking computers

03is better than MS Sam
03and it's fricking 1982!
1982
03I swear, most people just don't appreciate this movie
03my friend is already going o_O to it
06uuuuuuuugh
06I'm going to be late
03I like it for several reasons, but I guess being a nerd and liking movies about computers go hand and hand?

5Evenin'.
5How're you?
06tired
06so tired
06and old
06:>
5Really Roara? xD
5Did you get my note on dA? o3o
I feel young :P
5I feel dead. But that's 'cause I had the ACT earlier and BAH. Horrible, taking it in the middle of summer break. (Bad idea. Note to self: Never do that again.)
ACT?
06oh EW ACT
06horrible test
5Uhm... Only like the biggest test required to get into college? xD
with a horrible name
5(That and the SAT.)
06especially that bloody science portion
seriously, ACT?
06it's SAT here in CA
5Gaaawd!
thats worse then TAKS here
06Science portion = living heck
10Aurora
5The schools I'm looking at here only want ACT scores. D:
D:
06most schools outside of the west do
10o-o well I was about to say enjoy your last minute of your birthday but nevermind
06dunno why
5The Science portion actually isn't that bad IMO. ^__^;; It's just reading data...
06LOL
06yeah
06it's midnight
07it depends on the school which test they look at, not the state o3o
06Kyu that's true
06but for the most part
5Happy first full day of being 19~ xD
2 am now
06california is as obsessed with the SAT as I am with Soul
5Same here Brother.
Central time FTW?
06</horriblecomparision>
07mine preferred the ACT, but they didn't mind that I only had the SAT
5Yup!
5Nebraaaaaskaaaaaaa. <3
06other than UotP, where did you apply?
well Texas is as humid as every today
06and yeah, they accept SAT too
06not like ACT-only or SAT-only
5I think most Midwestern schools /prefer/ the ACT scores but some of them take SAT too.
07random state colleges, santa cruz, and cal poly
06you're kidding
06UC santa crus?
06cruz
5And then there's AP Exams which are just EVIL with the three-hours straight of WRITING ESSAYS. /rage
07didn't get in because of the lack of a 2nd spanish lol
06well 1, you applied there? lol
062, I SWORE UCSC wanted SAT
06whatever
06oh ew AP exams
07pretty much everything within 2 hours except berkeley just because I don't like it o3o
06those were....hprrible
06horrible
5I have to be good at Spanish. xD I want to minor in it..
07and I did have SAT
06LOL berkeley
5Which ones did you take Roara? (AP Exams)
07I said UoP preferred ACT
06Both english, and environmental science
5I have a friend who's going to Berkeley. o-o
06yeah and I was wondering what other colleges wanted ACT
12i have a friend who's going to TST
5@Roara :: This past year I took AP Lang. & Comp and AP World. Next year I'll probably take the AP Spanish exam.
07nerds
06OMG
06RP
5What?
06I heard that spanish exam is absolute MURDER
06the class is bad enough, but lol
5Really? D:
06I had a friend who took it
5I--I'm pretty good.
06he was amazing at spanish
5Meep!
06didn't pass it
/me 5is scared now.
5o_______o
07that's california though o3o
06that, along with physics and calculus, those are the 3 hardest
5AP Exams are universal. ><
06Kyu, AP are the same nationwide
07cheat then
/me runs
06speaking of which, gotta go get my scores sent officially to my school
5No! Then your scores get voided.
06I've been lazy about that lol
07yeah, if you get CAUGHT
/me runs louder
5And it'd be a waste of eighty bucks..
5HOW DO YOU RUN LOUDER. xD;
07simple
07allow me to demonstrate
06elephant feet
/me runs louder
5I still have a couple weeks or so 'til my AP scores come in. I'm kinda nervous, but eh, it is what it is.
5Haha, Roara.
where are those tapes..
I...
I think I broke it
5And I got a 28 on the ACT when I took it in April, and HOPEFULLY I improved my score when I took it Saturday morning.
thats a waste of a good morning to sleep in
broke what
5The school I want to I need a 30 to get the full-ride scholarship. ><;;;;;;;
5Hardly, Brother.
5It's my FUTURE.
Track and Confirm
5Literally the rest of my life (well a good chunk of it) is riding on that stupid test.
ok
They're gonna be maaaaad
07lol that was fun
that's really what I hate the most RP
lol
well no..2nd most
07i pulled a loose thread on a random ribbon i found in my room
07and the entire thing unravelled
5It's just the standardized test for college entrance. /shrug
5What can you do?
07that one thread kept the whole thing together XP
prefer the old days
5And omigosh Kyu, so what now? xD
02why am I reading fanfiction about neopets
02and no, it's not porn
5"The old days"?
07and now i throw it away? o3o
07it wasn't important lol
5Oh.
07it was just amusing o3o
5Well you could save it as thread.
RP: when I meab by
5And make something amazing.
5<333
the old days I mean old eastern europe
5Uh.......
5........Peter the Great old?
5./shot
No
5I was kidding.
before the 90s old :p
5Oh.
5THAT'S NOT OLD.
5That's like modern times.
well it is 'old' to the people there XD
5That's like back when music and TV were actually good.
/me 5runs!
04lol
07o3o
since the changes in the 90s were the epoch of failure for eastern eyrope
*euorpe
*europe
I can't spell today
/me 5was supposed to have been born in the '80's, fwahaha.
07in an rp
12why the heck are you asking? lol
I was suppose to be born sometime, but It was delayed 4 times
5Oohh.
then early 5 days
07because there's nothing of importance for him to head off to?
12there's nothing of importance for him to stay lol
RP: well I 'prefer' them because you didnt have to take the tests and pay some thousands apon thousands of dollars to get into college XD
12it seems you all got him pretty well
5@Brother :: Like I said, it's just the way the system works.
07well you give the impression that he's leaving the group o3o
5Besides, they gotta pay the coaches their millions somehow.
/me 5gets SHOT! xD
07why wouldn't he just land or something
12i'm leaving the battlefield
12not the group
well, I'm not one to accepting the system anyway :P
/me shot
12if i landed inside the battlefield i'm bound to become target to an attack or a stray attack
06the battle's over
5I love football but the Longhorns coach does not need to get paid nearly five million a year for a team that got slaughtered by the Crimson Tide. Srsly.
07at least mention that he landed somewhere in sight though oo3
07o3o
07like on a rooftop or something
o.o
5OH HEY did anyone watch the World Cup today!?
12what if he doesn't want to land? lol
no
06RP, no
06who won?
06...
I saw /b/ rage about the work cup though :3
06real football
07then he would be flying around the radius of the battle, not flying 'away'
tie
07o3o
06tie wut?
US v England was tie game
Aurora: on to her longhorns statement twit o3o
5Omigosh, I'm trying to find the result.
5Wait what!?
1-1
5What about the game?
5It was a tie?
Yes.
:V
5SERIOUSLY?
06um
though I'm kinda shocked that they get payed 5 million for some apperent reason
5Omigosh you're right. OO:
06isn't there like....some kind of overtime?
no
12oh well
06....WUT LOL
It's round robin at the moment
06so, that's it?
06....
o.o
5I was watching it and when that goal just sliiiiiiiiipped by the England goalie I was like WHOOOOOOOOA.
tiebreakers only really have to happen in finals games
02XD
06I thought this WAS the final
no
:V
06hmm
5England should've slaughtered the U.S., and I live here. xD;; Statistically, they just seemed superior. Besides our team was kinda sloppy that first half...
06then why the heck is it a big deal?
5Because it's the World Cup?
Because US sucks at soccer
06argh
:V
5Because it's only the biggest soccer/football event EVER?
And we tied England
/me isnt a sports person unless it's high school/college volleyball or water polo
5We got that goal by a fluke.
wait, where do you live, RP4L?
5Nebraska.
5In the U.S.
in the central time
5Why?
k
You confused me
:V
5Soccer is /not/ big here, buuut I like it.
5I used to play it as a kid. xD
I don't quite care
5Ahh..k.
I'm just forced to know about it because /b/
5o-o
Apparently the african teams have fans that have annoyingly loud horns
or so I've gathered
evening
So I've gathered from /b/
5I've heard it's pretty popular over there. ^^; Probably explains a lot of that.
It's popular everywhere except here :V
5LOL, yeah.
5And those Founding Father guys.
or not
:(
5**Fathers
06I
06hate
06baseball
And native peoples getting put into opressive reservations.
5ME TOO.
Baseball's okay
/me doooooooooom
5That's the worst stain on US History.. IMO.. next to the whole slavery thing.. >>;;
06ooooook
5Yeah.
no its worst stain is that slave owners say all men are equal
5D:
i mean really
5We scared her off.
nah, its 1 am over there
5;;
she has to go to sleep for some 'reason'
and worker repressions
racial repressions that even go on today
5Brother, I think we all took US History in 9th grade.
and the list goes on
I took it in 8th
i hated it
5(Just saying.)
because it lied like crap
like Texan History
5xD
but then..thats Texas, they still dont admit their 'revoluion' was based on white slave owners wanting to be independent and become apart of the slavery US
or how they thanked the teanjos by stripping them of all rights
5I have some choice words about Texas... then again, you've probably heard about all the Nebraska-Texas hubbub concerning last season's football game, Big XII Championship.
nope
I loath Texas on all levels
5So I'll spare you. ^__;
12you people post too fast XD
so whatever you do say of texas, I wouldnt care XD
more like you post too slow
:0
just another territory
like the territory of nebraska :p
used to be big, but then you go small
*got
Territory of wherever Brother lives :0
5But then at like.. the end of the game Colt McCoy (gr) was all "HEY REF WE HAVE 1 SECOND LEFT"
5and all the Nebraskans were like "UH NO IT'S THE END OF THE GAME GIVE US OUR BIG XII CHAMP TROPHY"
and then a war started between the nebraskans and the Texans
and we never lived happily ever after :p
The only thing I loathe about today's politics is the cutthroat partisanship
5but then the ref was like "WELL I GUESS THERE WAS A SECOND LEFT" and so then Texas kicked a field goal and won. By a single point. But that still doesn't count for the FOUR SACKS Ndamukong Suh had on McCoy. ;D
5SUUUUUUUUUH. <3
Texas, all they need is 1 second
I'd made a chuck noris thing, but I'm to lazy/tired to make one
Suh almost got the Heisman, right?
5http://cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/a/a/f/b/Big_12_Championship_fc1a.jpg <-- Greatest football picture ever. xD
5He did, however, win a whole bunch of other awards.
arg....Stomach stop being in pain
5Including the Outland. Which I went to go see the ceremony of. And loved. And got Suh's autograph. <3
The what?
5Outland Trophy goes to the best Defensive player.
(ended
5@Brother :: yeah, I did. I was actually kind of upset by that; probably a good thing Arti locked it. xD; Otherwise I would've gotten myself into some major heat.
upset by what?
What?
5Eh... nevermind.
/me no forumgoer
5It's not worth digging up again.
or something like that
wat.
5If you wanna read it, go read it. It's in Debates/Discussions.
then it was closed due to someone showing a shirt of a list of nations bombed by the US
5That's what I didn't care for.
what made you upset then?
5Personally, I thought it was a very low blow.
thats not a low blow
5There's debating.. and then there's pulling out the claws.
the shirt was like 'the bird'
harsh, yet you can take it
5Like I said, /personally/.
right
5It's just how I felt.
I wonder why no one posted about the freedom flotia yet o.o
5The what what?
happened a few weeks ago
5On second thought -- I probably don't want to know.
yeah, thats a good thing
pretty much a israeli military attack
/me goes to listen to Ballade of a soldier to translate it
RP: you going to sleep anytime soon? :P
sonce it is 2:38 am
*since
5Yeah, probably.
5I have to get up early for church. Youth group's doing a car wash to raise money for our mission trip. :D
hmm, you watch nostalgia critic?
I only remember one church thing i had, somc meeting where everyone brought their dogs
then that advancement thing
forgot its 'offical' name
its like when you're 12-3 in church
what is it called again?
5I love Nostalgia Critic. :D
he reviewed a troll in central park now
5And no clue what you're talking about.
I still have that movie XD
well I'd say you'd have to get all 'nicely dressed up' for it
but then thats every church day
so thats vauge
5xD I don't dress up for church unless I'm giving the sermon or something.
12i'm surprised there isn't a sister here
sermon...sermon...
thats like a speech right? XD
5 Yup.
For I have no knowlege on the practices what so ever now
5I love giving them.
/me pokes the chat
oh now i remembered why I dont remember them
5x3
..contradictory yes
but yeah I always slept through that
5You probably had a boring pastor.
/me 5runs!
we had a funny one
5Well that's good, at least.
5Why?
they had no point
in my mind back then
It was more like
5Oh. Right. There's absolutely no point in treating other people the way you want to be treated.
5;)
ha, you know thats not really good to say that :P
but mostly I had more of the jesus lessons
tell that to king james
/me Dies
or any other king
it depends XD
5King James Version is actually REALLY inaccurate.
5Like, dead serious.
No duh
it has unicorns
04lol
but then this is the sme book thats been revised so many times I could make it into a 20 volume series
ohlook it's working again
or 18 plus 2 side works
5And like half of the original Hebrew books are lost (D:) so everything's changed.
hey
lost or misplaced? ;P
/me runs
5But I dunno. I've done /some/ Bible study but not extensively.
02o.o
02bai Drake
oh god that book was torture to me XD
to me at like...13
5I want to eventually acquaint myself with the Quran (I probably misspelled that).
it was a book that repeated itself
Quran?
5The Islam book of faith?
I thought it was with a K
like Koran
though I suck at arabic
5N-no. xD;
and too lazy to go to wikipedia
5Qur'an.
5That's it.
ah
but yeah, 6th period (this year) was so hilarious
5What class was it?
for literally every relgious person there
tried to get me on their side
computer class
5Wow.
:D
the musliums
there were no jewish though
5I can't wait until next year (senior year for me!) when I take the new World Religions class. It's going to be so fascinating~
5(**Muslims?)
I suck at grammar at 2 am
or 3 am really
RP: it'll be at some respects
the teachers dont want talk of religion here
5None?
No
5LOL, we have a bible study club at our school. xD But it's after-school, sooo...
D:
:(
/me hides behind Curly
lol
I'd definitely be the brawn >_>
and by all I literally mean that
random thing of the night
5Don't they teach some religion aspects in.. like... world history courses?
LOL
this is j3 high
* jr
we dont get that luxary
*lucxary
5Oh, ha ya.
arg..
5I thought you were in high school?
I'm considered in it
but I'm not
I consider this propaganda school but then thats for alot of reasons
5Cattle in a bun = amazing. Actually, I could go for a big, juicy hamburger right now...
:P
5Wow, propaganda school, that's pretty bad.
from orwellite love to real brain was school
5Maybe my school would restore your faith in schools. xD;
it wouldnt I bet XD
5Well, maybe a little?
Not in the slightest
I have no problem with some of the teachers
5It's literally the most integrated school in the state... which I suppose isn't saying much for Nebraska... but I love it here.
notice some
but I dont have trust in the educational system
period
5Well, then, I certainly hope you're going into politics as an adult.
LOL when they told me how to make the school better I put it
"Stop the orwellite love, its annoying"
Well, yes but no
I'm into many things
philosophy
world economics
or just economics in generall
*-l
pyshcology
5Out of curiosity, who's your role model in history? Like, who do you strive to be most like>
5**?
ha, thats a difficult question
theres alot
Oh geeze
from the US to the USSR XD
5Pick one.
hmm...
Harry Haywood
JEFFREY DAHMER.
/me runs
thats my favorite
5Wow. Omaha resident.
5Well, was born here.
Harry Haywood?
5yup.
ah
but he's just...AWSOME
he was the best we got
5My role model would have to be... Well, you'll laugh at the stereotypicality, but...
5Mohandas Gandhi.
LOL oh you wont believe how much I hate him
What was Harry Haywood?
Who, rather.
5Seriously. If I could be like anyone, /anyone/, I would want to live by Gandhi's moral code.
he really helped the "black nation" theory
5@Brother :: Why?
why?
heres several reasons
racist
5Yes.
imperialist apologist
general arse
and really I wonder
how could he take the credit for thousands of strugglign people
and claim it that he did it all
he lead it
5Um, since when?
5It was a national effort.
5He was just an icon.
only for the nationalist congress
but then guess the ICP lost that
when we lost our best man in in the 30s
hanged for treason
aka, he fought the british goverment and they captured him
put him on trial, he mocked them
and went to his death with a sense of pride
Best person I can think of is Nelson Mandela, but that's just off the top of my head
5But eh. Also on the list are Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mandela especially, I mean wow, talk about a tough job being president!
5Mandela is amazing.
:V
I also like...
Malcom X
JVS
5Another Omahan!
and...Beriut
5(Malcom X)
Malcom X is seriously FTW
John Wooden is definitely someone I like.
To have someone that's not a political advocate
or whatever term
So now two of my favs are from your territory RP?
activist
that's it
3 am, whoo
4 here
5Yup.
but yeah i need to know more about Beriut
5I really should go to bed. x__x

/me notes
12Since my parents are moving and all I want to go back there one last time
12Plus Lugia and Xai want to go to Devon over Cumbria anyway
fine by me
12I don't know when I'm gonna get another chance except maybe on a weekend
12To Cumbria that is
12near the end of the year we're probably going to Scotland too
well don't feel pressured to appear or anything o-o
12Nah I just want to but can't
12Although I want to go to Devon that bit more
ah well, have fun
I guess this means I can go rollerskating all the time, now
12Eh...?

http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/
12Free???
eeeeeee
It looks like it
I found it last night, started listening to a lecture about engineering, then decided I cba w/ ~40 minutes of of it at 12AM
12Hi :>
hi
zoroark have you got any buddies cos i want you to be my buddy
12I'm Articuno by the way
12I sometimes use Zoroark on chat
...*speechless*
goodnight all
goodnight all
12Lol ^^
yes why?
12I thought so :3 Hi
12nice to meet you
nice to meet you to ;)
12I just drew the new bird Pokemon, I think I'll colour it ^^
what bird is it
/me wants to see!
Hey
hi lugia
/me is somewhat sad
04T_T
why
12I haven't seen you in AGES!!
04Hey Arti
12Whats wrong..?
04Just an awkward dream I had
04Kinda lowered my confidence in going back to school for year 13
oh
04I dreamt my Media teacher was evil.
04Omen? O_O
12Nah just natural worries
04I think I should drop media lessons, I've done badly and I've struggled a lot
04If they'll let me have 2 lessons only.
i will be year 7 soon and i very worried *shivers*
12Well I hate to be blunt but there are much better courses you can spend your time on than that ^^;
04I know.
12Oh wow, year 7.. so you're starting a new school?
04What was I smoking when I thought media?
04Actually, I think that's Middle 3 if we're talking middle school.
12Getting the pic now, Lugia
04Anyway, throughout my study leave, I made random videos.
Yay! Thanks ^v^
yeah
04And joining Yugioh Tournaments
04I went to one yesterday, made it up to the semis
cool
/me recieves an Achievement Unlocked Message
04Hmm.
12Otherwise it'll be a waste, and one course on your CV (even if you don't like it) is better than NO course.
04I just know I have bad grades though.
04What's the point in staying if the grades are useless?
lugia what you up to
12Because there's still a chance you can make it up :>
04Make it up?
04You mean lie to the interviewer?
yeah youve got to try
12No I mean , haven
12Havent you got another year?
04Yeah.
12Then do well on the next year
04Oh, make up for it.
12^^
12Yeh XD
12lol
04Ha, I doubt it.
12There may be a small chance, but it's still a chance.
04Damn! That dreams dropped my self esteem completely.
04I've gone mad.
hi espeon
12http://j.imagehost.org/0707/peadgePokemon.jpg
12I'm gonna be busy colouring this now, will still be here
12and I'm going back to Zoroark
I KNEW you would Arti xD
12LOL
/me clicks
04Only one thing I can do good at school and that's drama. I just wanna get that done at least, then go to a drama college or something.
XD, it looks so cute ^v^
espeon how old are you im 11

04And I will name it Klonoa

04Because it is glompworthy
...
04I take it you dont know klonoa...
04No surprise, considering he's an under-rated game character.
no...DONT HURT ME!!!!!
12Probably not Lugia, too hard
Ah, meepity, worth a shot ^^'

okay well bye then...*sniff*
hiya zoroark
...
lugia i read your profile and your in south africa whats it like
12LOL
hi
what you doing
12Drawing
12I'd prefer it if you didn't lol
well it is shorter
12I like just being called Arti
did lugia tell you what its like in s.africa
12Err.. yes, he has told me many times
what team do you like i like liverpool
12I used to support Exeter City but now I don't support any particular team
did you watch england last night i was a bit disapionted it was a draw
12Yeh I watched it and was very disappointed..
12Started off SO well
12By the way
yes
12Did ITV also screw up for you when the England scored the first goal??
nah
12Because when we were watching it.. they cut to an advert for about 15 seconds by mistake.. and when the game came back on, the first goal had already been scored and we missed it :/
12Were you watching it on Normal TV by any chance..?
im sorry to hear that gerrard scored the first goal and yes i was
12Ahh yeh we were watching it on digital HD
o3o
yeah we have got virgin media
12same here!
cool!
12Best internet connection in the country :3
12Oh yeh, where do you live..?
12Like where in the UK
corby you
12I'm guessing St Helens
12Is Corby near St Helens?
12I live in Leeds
ahh
12I guess I was wrong, I just googled Corby, why do you support Liverpool and Not Newcastle then? hehe
12I'm just joking by the way :>
lol
can i share a secret with you
and promise you wont tell anyone?????!!!!!
12Err
12Sure ^v^
/me runs
12I promise I won't tell anyone
i fancy gerrard
12XD Lol!
12Loads of girls do..
i do
12Not me though XD
ok
4who would win rayquaza or ho-oh
12I guess Rayquaza
4i think rayquaza aswell!
12Most of Ho-oh's fire moves won't effect Rayquaza much but Rayquaza's dragon moves would do enough damage to Ho-oh
what about...groudon or kogore kogore
unless groudon knows solarbeam
12Yeh but even then
12Groudon is not a grass type
12So Solarbeam would not be anywhere near as good as Kyogre's water moves
but in the episode the scuffle of leagends groudon knows solarbeam
12I haven't seen it, but like I said, it's not a grass type so it won't do as much as if a grass type used it
12Pokemon moves do extra damage if they are the same type
12Like Gyarados knows Thunderbolt but if Electabuzz used Thunderbolt, it would do MUCH more damage than Gyarados can because of the extra points
have you played heartgold or soulsilver if you have did you like them
12I have Soul Silver and I love it but I haven't even beaten the Elite Four yet because I am trying to train my Pokemon all to level 50 first
i beat the elite four but i couldnt beat lance i kept on using lugia but had no luck
what was your starter pokemon mine was cyndaquil
12Same!
12I always use cyndaquil
on the box there were pics of cyndaquil so i chose it
are you hoping for england to win the world cup
tell lugia i said hi cos im going ill be back on later bye
arti...
12Yeh?
i forgot now lol
12DD:
i remember now does this sound wrong lugia sound sexy cos he does...
12Err.. you mean the Pokemon from the movie?
no...the other one...DONT HURT ME!
12XD
12Why do you think he sounds sexy? Have you ever seen/heard/spoken to him? XD
no i mean it
12Except on chat?
i have spoken to him on chat
12Ok, so what makes you think that then? XD
12Is it just because his name is Lugia ? XD
i dont know he just does
12Based on what?
dont know
12What if he looked like this
12http://netsummary.dk/bianco/images/ugly_man.jpg

*dies*
12:D
IM SORRY LUGIA *CRIES*
12I don't think he'll mind

You know what word I hate?
Flavor.
7o3o
03you know what face I hate? o3o.
/me runs
Just say it over and over in your head, it gets annoying and then it doesn't even sound like a word. I mean, wth
12ROARAAA!!!!!!!
7Well, every word can do that to you. O-o
06I hate any word that involves being "cute" by ending with the "ie" wrd
06ZOROARK
/me catches
12brb Xai's just got home XD
06OMG IT'S A PEADGE
06<3<3<3<3
03EW
03that thing looks like it has pimples on its nose
06all peadges look like that, drf
06lol
12Yes but remember DRF is thick :3
03orly now?
03I don't recall Pidgey having pimples
06ffs
06I hate people calling pidgey a peadge
06it was NEVER a peadge
06just the name
06which was stupid
03define peadge, then.
06...
12Wow
06wtf why?
06a peadge is a peadge
12That really IS thick
06Pidgey is loosely based on a house sparrow
03wtf is a peadge
12FFS DRF
03you can't make up words and expect everyone to know what you're tlaking about
12WE SAY THE WORD AT LEAST ONCE A DAY
03*talking
06LOL
12IT MEANS PIGEON!!
06PEADGE IS UNIVERSAL HERE
7o3o
06anywaysssss
12also I agree Roara, I always hated people thinking Pidgey was anything like a pigeon....
12No
12I don't use DA anymore
06Pidgey was never a PIGEON, it was a house sparrow (loosely) with traits of a Lanner Falcon
12O_o I thought you knew that already
06after it evolved, it became a full Lanner Falcon
7Well, you said you were inactive.
12LOL DRF
12Inactive as in I don't use it
12But not dead because I still use it to view people's art
12and I meant dont use it as in don't put art or anything on it
7Okay. o3o
12So do you like it Roara?
06Zoroark
03there it is again
06you're a peadge
12Lol yes ^^
06and yes I doooooooooooooooooooooooooo <3
12^^
03Articuno isn't a pigeon >_>
06just for drf
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
06o3o
/me dies
06^victory
7o3o
06nah, I'm done using that face
7To Rora's o3o
why does everyone think it's funny to <censored> me off?
06it got to the point it was instinctive to put it lmao
12HAHAH
06o-o
7o_o
06usually because you don't get super mad about it
03>_>
12DRF what are you talking about? You annoy people ALL the time
7Poor drf.
06but if you do, I obviously back off
03not intentionally...
12I mean you just told me art art is "ew"
12That's just rude
03except that you didn't create Pokémon
12Yeh intentionally ¬¬ some people don't like the Apple comments you make but you do it anyway
03so if you get offended by that, that's not my problem
06he hates all new pokemon
12I know he does so why does he have to say it about my art?
12it's just rude
03that was yours? It looked like something Nintendo made
06I kinda figured he meant the design of the pokemon
06which you didn't make
03yeah, I did
12Oh thanks XD that's better
06LMAO
03I didn't realize Articuno drew it
06that's like the best comment there XD
03I thought that was just a clipart
03and if people get offended by me hating APple, then they're just stupid
/me hides
12Well if you get annoyed AT A FACE USED ON IRC YOU'RE JUST STUPID XD
06lol
03but people use it JUST TO ANNOY ME
12No
12That was like, once
03I don't go "EW APPLE" just to annoy people, I do it when someone brings up Apple
03orly?
03Kyu even admitted it last night >_>
06arti, that happens alot actually lol
03people do it just to p¡ss me off
03which I don't get
7If you didn't say you disliked that face, we wouldn't have bothered.
03why am I so fun to provoke?
06quan, I've openly admitted I hate things too
12Same reason Apple is so fun to make fun of?
06people tend to respect that though
03Zoroark, making fun of products != making fun of people
7Nweh?
12We're not making fun of you personally
12Sheesh
what you talking about
03doing something JUST to annoy me
03is kinda just that
/me apologizes :/
12Ok well I'm sorry but being inconsiderate isn't much better, if people ask you not to bad mouth Apple you do anyway
03I wasn't blaming you
06yeah that WAS my fault this time
06well I did do it this time to annoy you
12and I've had you complain at me for people being annoyed at your Apple comments before lol
03XD
03Zoroark, people who get offended by me making fun of products are just stupid then
12Yeh but..
03I don't care if you go EW MICROSOFT, I won't get offended
eating dinner i be back soon
03I just don't agree :P
12People who get offended at someone using a face.. is not stupid....?
06I honestly don't know why people get upset about the apple thing
03I don't get *offended*
12You get annoyed when people do it even if they ARENT doing it at you
03I just think it's annoying when people do it 27,000 times a day
03no, see
03it's not that
03if someone just used it once in a while
12Lies
03that's fine
03but people use it like, every likne
06he generally ignores it
03*line
03it's not like I go EW APPLE every two lines I write
03I only do it when someone brings up iPods or something
06!apple
10EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SCROLL WHEELS
06!apple
03EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SAFARI
03and even then I generally leave it to the script
06two lines
03^
03...LOL
06lmao
06anyhoo
03and Arti, WTF? I thought you agreed with me that that face was stupid
03you even set a kill script for it
12It is but it doesn't annoy me XD
12I just think it looks stupid!
03it just annoys me when people do it every 2 lines
03which they do
03like, people stopped saying 'deshou' after a while
12How's that any different from many lines of apple ranting in one go XD
06when you get used to doing it, it somehow manages to just fly off your fingers every line
03and I'm sure just because I said that they'll start again just to annoy me >_>
06which I actually thought about...it IS annoying lol
03Zoroark, the difference is, I don't rant about Apple intentionally to bug people
03that, and people shouldn't get offended by me badmouthing products... they didn't make it
12But you get annoyed when people use the face even if it's not to annoy you
06....most of the time, people don't use the face to bug you though
06they just use it
03just like if I Make fun of Nintendo's new designs for Pokémon... who cares?
03But they DO use it to annoy me
drf: they might be fans of the poor products?
03some of them
06I'm sure some do
12Yes but you still get annoyed even when they don't XD which is stupid
06but others don't even pay attention
03<Kyu> at this point I like using it to bug drf
06yeah that's typical Kyu though
12DRF it's the same reason that we spam more when people go STOP IIIITTTTT
12It's just funny
03and I never said it was annoying, I just said it's stupid
03XD
03well
12Omg liar
03how about I make a script that adds "EW APPLE" to the end of every line I say
7o3o
03and we'll see how long it takes for people to start whining
12You're always telling people not to use that face because it's annoying
7Unfortunately, I use o3o as a common smiley.
12LOOOOOOOOL
7Like O_o or :P
03first of all, it's not a smiley
03it's not SMILING
12Maybe it is to SOME people
06I can see the smile lol
03I've never seen you use O_o
03you just use O3o >_>
06O_o
12Then again, how is D:< a smiley?! That's not smiling either!
06^literal smiles
03I never said it was
03it's a face
03not a smiley
03if you want a smiley

12No, Smilies are little faces portraying emotions -v-
06lol
06EMOTES
06there's the word
03I call them faces
03unless they're actually smiling
12Yes but they're called smilies too
03but whatever
03anyway
o3o
03well that's a regional thing :P
12-v-
06....lol
wrong channel but o-o
06I think the problem is just how MANY people use the aface
06face
06it wouldn't be used so much
06except over half the people here use it
7oÎµo
03kinda like soda/pop/fizzy drinks
03people would go 'wtf is pop'
03but that's what we call it here
03I'll call it soda just so people know wtf I'm talking about XD
12*sigh* I can go anywhere/do anythingI want right now and I can't even decide on something >V<
cyrillic face XD

/me 7has used it as tools in English and Social Studies classes.
/me hides
03I don't mind TV Tropes, but it DOES get addicting as that one comic portrayed
Eww doesn't mean I do like 99% of internet people and call you overused terms for homosexuals because you like it, it just means I don't like it personally :3
im back
03LOL Espeon
hi arti
I never understood what makes tvtropes addicting
03I honestly don't care what people ew
03because I do it myeslf :P
i've never been drawn into a clicking spree there
03well
03it's like Wikipedia
03that's happened to me too
03where you look up something and start clicking everythign else
03it's because it links to so many other things
hello
03well
yes, like any wiki
03with TV Tropes, it's because you have no idea what most of them mean
06lol linkage
I guess I just don't like the "humor"
hi espeon
7http://xkcd.com/609/
03"Just like [so and so] name" "What's that, I've never heard of it *clicks*"
7Wallah.
03like that
and I wonder why so many people use "<censored>" as an insult anyway.
03LOL fail
lol
but really
03OK, note to self
03downloading 3 files at once KILLS my bandwidth
03that XKCD Page doesn't even want to load >_>
*cries*
03use what as an insult?
<censored>
12I looked at it, saw a messy page and then closed it XD
7o3o
7Hmm?
o.o anti script avoiding ?
03LOL FAIL
12Yeh
12:3
03Um, do it again with a space or something
03is it just me

f ag. I wonder why everyone uses that as an universal insult. I
03ah
7Well, I'm immune because I've been on there a lot.
12HAHAHAHA
03...WTF
7http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitlei015gc004kw4?from=Main.Pokemon <-- Not even that, if you read down?
12XD
jeez
xD
03that word also means cigarette
i know
12That was manual.....
/me runs
that's what I usually counter with
xD
03it's just when you don't know what any fo them them are
03*of them are
12Hold on Wuan
12*QUAN XD
lolwut
7Yes?
brb
hi arti
03hm, I never noticed that... ircip1 and ircip2
03that makes it harder to ban people from Mibbit
12I scrolled down.. none of it makes ANY sense to me
7Click the links.
03which is exactly why you start clicking everyting
03XD
03*everything
12But.. I'm not interested in clicking them
12They don't interest me in the slightest
12It's just a big block of text to me
12Yes I know it's you
7Well, do. :P
03XD
oh...
03I suppose you can't please everybody
7I actually got sucked in from ButThouMust.
03I have no problem with TV Tropes, I just try not to get sucked in
03I mean, I agree with most of the tropes
03I've actually quoted that "Imperial Stormtrooper Accuracy" one several times IRL
03or w/e the name is
what you talkin about
7Acadamy.
03your face
7Academy*
03wait, what?
03no
03it's the one about how the bad guys can't aim
06I tend to enjoy the tropes on pokemon
03not Academy o.o
06it makes to realize some really bizarre thing you'd never think about normalls
06normally
7http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy
03yeah
7Here y'go.
hi espeon
/me waits for it to load -_-
03my Internet is being murdered right now
haha
03hm, yeah, that one
03why the frick is Adademy in the name o_O
7Because apparently, the mooks all graduated with a degree in gunfiring from there?
03LOL
03degree in gunfiring, wtf
06lol I found a false fact in the tropes
06The more recent generations seem to have addressed this to some degree - for example, while Bulbasaur and Squirtle started with Grass and Water attacks respectively, in Gen III you have to level up your starter for a while before you get to those attacks. So beating Roxanne isn't simply a matter of having picked Treecko or Mudkip. You have to train them a little first. (Also, Roxanne has Nosepass which is pure Rock, instead of Rock/Ground,, which
06rock is weak against grass
03hm?
06:P
03that's not false
03they're saying you don't learn actual grass type attacks until a higher level
03now THAT, I can't verify
03but that made sense to me
implying that tvtropes is a reliable source of legit information
HAHAHA OH WOW
03XD
03Wikipedia is, though.
/me hides
to a certain degree
on certain things it is
03my friend and I vandalized a page on Sith Lords once at our school
06(Also, Roxanne has Nosepass which is pure Rock, instead of Rock/Ground,, which makes it only weak toward Water, not Grass.) <-I meant that
no-ones listening to me
on others, its as true as the sony corpoation
03got the school's IP banned from Wikipedia :D
03Aurora, oh. well it got cut off
i was right
06sorry lmao
drf: orly nao
03(Also, Roxanne has Nosepass which is pure Rock, instead of Rock/Ground,, which <-- that's where it cut cut off
what did you say on it XD
lol our school got the whole range of ips and such banned from too many sites to remember
03:P
7Where is this info, Rora?
03Bro, we said "Examples of Sith Lords include Adolf Hitler, [some teacher from our school], and George W. Bush"
03and they ended up banning the school from editing it
ha XD
03well, obviously other people were vandalizing it too
03but it was us that got it banned :D
there was so many banned sites on my school, some were just stupid bans
03I don't mean the SITE was banned
03I mean if you go to edit Wikipedia
03it says "Your IP has been banned for constant abuse"
03now I believe it says something like "You cannot edit pages from a public institution due to its tendency to be abused", or some variation of that
i remember one time some dude tried to find out who got the school banned from 4chan xD
that sure shows what he were doing at school
7Ah, FakeUltimateMook?
03LOL Espeon
03you can get banned from 4chan?
03That defies all laws of the universe.
03that entire site is devoted to people being retarded trolls
well, outside of
the board that is the only board people appearently think of
there are rules infacct
03oh, /b/?>
ha, rules?
yes. people think 4chan =/= /b/ simply
it grinds my gears
03you mea ==
*yawns*

*cries* but im only 11
03so?

03that doesn't mean you can't learn how to spell properly

Japan is totally not kawaii desu like beloved naru/any other anime-tards think
...
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrmb29QX0wI <-- This. Is what made me know that Japanese people can't dance

No matter how much japanese you know and how many animes you have watched unless you are born there you are NOT JAPANESE

...
/me scythe-prods Kyu
/me hugs

Hello~
I read "Rejoining" as "Reloading" for some reason
YES
ok
http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3ymjbFpCf1qzvjn8o1_500.jpg
07because you're still going nuts over the catnip apparently
hi
hi Kyu
who likes chatting
03your mom
03yes, we're all in a chatroom and we hate chatting.
more floofhugs
shut up
hey
what
03<Roara> no /slap and no /kick (why) <-- not sure why SysReset removed slap... LOL, kick... it's under hOp commands
knock it off >_>
03<Roara> this looks all ugly compared to IRC though <-- I prefer that
drf is such a bully :(
03I LIKE that layout
03but if you don't
03Tools - Options :)
03just change it XD
i know
nah I fixed it
03OK
kick is there
03I prefer the vintage look, I honestly found the little side bar with channels silly
but regular IRC had a kick (why)
03yeah, slap is the only one they got rid of
03dunno
03it makes more sense under hOp commands, TBH
03or Op commands if you're an op
OH
The "why) is there still
03yes
03it's a popup box
erm
ok new problem
I can't kick LOL
03o.o
03who are you trying to kick?
I click kick, and it gives me the popup
Aero
03XD
03then type something and hit OK
I did
03o.o
the popup goes away
but she's still here
lmao
ok...
03you went to hOp commands - Kick?
yes
03click the name first
03then right click
03try that
ohhey
03there
>:
ok
sorry aero
XD 'tis okay~
it made more sense that way :P
LOL
O:
/me runs
/me chases!
ok, now to fix my color script
07eeep!
03I think otherwise the person isn't selected
03well
03Soul, what you can do
/me holds a chibidragorie in front of him
03well nvm
zomg O:
03I don't know how it works in the portable one
03but
/me flailtacklehuggles chibidragorie :DDD
03just reinstall mIRC, and tell it to delete your scripts, and it should work
03copy the ones you want before hand
06ddssfds
06there
06it's purple right?
07no

06go drown in a ditch
lol
07look! it's a picture of Soul drowning in a ditch! =D
06:|
O:
06ok
06WHY was pokewalkercheat banned
um
03because he was bugging people?
07for 2 days for being a nub
because he didn't learn no matter anyone said?
07it expired already
03only 2 days?
06....I love your answers lol
03I'd just keep it permanent LOL
03I usually don't believe in banning
03but when people are morons
03then by all means
^
03banning *trolls* is fine... banning innocent users like myself is another thing
/me runs
06you say the ban is expired
06but it says there's still a ban
06and yet, he posted yesterday
07because expired bans stay on the list
06his profile will always say "this user is banned"?

In my mind you are an Umbreon who becomes floofy then.
Which is acceptable.
LOL
/me slurps |3
Lolz
/me lets the dual tailtips find their way between her legs, still stroking her cheeks with a paw~
/me floofs Skylands :3
/me eeps!
/me sucks more lustfully |3
10I'm gonna use your new Bree pic on HoR if you don't mind
/me humps slightly into her muzzle, panting quite rapidly by now. "Ugh... good..."
Sure :3

in 3 a nuclear war would be happening
and Thry would still leave him alone XD
*they
Oh WOW

/me shivers a bit, knowing he wouldn't be capable of lasting too long, but at the moment just enjoying the gentle licking.
Kitty noms :3
/me senses he's close, and after a bit she sucks on him HARD <3
10!espeon
I sure like Umbretails
/me lets out a sigh as he pulls her head further down on him, a slight whine warning her about his impending climax. Moments after warm sticky Espy seed finds its way into her muzzle, kitty letting out a content sigh along the way as well as after.
So now espeon belongs to Umbreon
Lulz |3
10that isn't weird at all
/me shot
/me gulps down all the cum <3
LOL that Breepic fits so well as an avatar that it's not even funny
/me sighs and lays down lazily, very wet~
and of course it isn't
10The floofiest Bree around
/me is sad from looking at pics of his old cat and dog
/me crawls over to her with a smile on his face, sniffing slightly between her legs before giving a testing lick.
:(
/me eeps!
/me moans softly as she gets licked <3
/me 13is back
/me smiles up at her, "I'm sure you wouldn't mind the same treatment as your muzzle got down here" he teases :3

Now :3
13Xeli gave birth to the unvierse
10What's the project about?

13Nah
5Um, it's just a thing I started that doesn't really have much to it. xD Just a scene from a PokÃ©mon RP I'm in..
/me jumps from the echo
10also +100 for the simplistic Absol, Xeli
/me does so~ <3
13Everything in the universe is my floof :U

/me nods
10Whoa, they have almost 16k members o_O
12o3o
And a proper technique
07like cash.
10I wasn't expecting that XD tbh
07cash works.
12hai
You can even cheat and just chuck a stick on dynomite into the water and collect all the fish that float up
of**
ha
10they're forum layout sucks
/me shot
Or you can skip fishing and just go to a fish store...
<.<
>.>
12kay
hello skylands
a stick of dynamite would probably kill most of a lake
But you'd get your fish
ha
lol, chucking sticks of dynomite into lakes become illegal because too many people kept blowing off their hands
O_o
but the fish would taste of ashes
lol
J :D

aye... my brother is learning programming code.... and i can barely keep up in the conversation with him
lol
programming can be quite the adventure
apperently he wants to learn html and php and give up on c++
C++ is tough
HTML is easy
and php is in the middle
id figure
at a book store i saw a book of C++ and it was like 2 dictionaries combined
I have one for Dummies
i took a chunk of pages and flipped it and there was chapter 2
yeah i think that was the one

Arti, nah, I know what it looks like
playing FPS on a console is just too hard
plus I'll be working til 5, you'll probably be gone by the time I get home
12Ok
well
that's 10 your time
but I'm also gonna run an errand on my 15 minute drive home
i see
:/
murr.
i've been playing blasted LoL non-stop
i'm so tired of some of the people in that game lol
LOL, at this guy.
you mean all of them?
not all of them just some
hahha this guy sounds like a sophisticated british person
there are many more people i hate in halo :P
at least LoL i haven't seen any trash talkers
comments on ustream: he is gay
..yet D:
"British humour, you know what that means", no, I don't.
12thanks :)
4haha
but
the one thing that annoys me is that almost all of my matches
very very dry.
one person will always DC on my side
lol.
Hahaha.
4lol
result, i have like a 8 loss streak

that sucks
Looks like fable hasn't gotten water right.
12indeed
!define 2000
I actually don't play many actual games, people tend to flame less in practice since its.. practice
122000 was a leap year?
12wow it is a leap year XD
4im the angel
NOOO
not crytek
Oh well at least their stuff will still be on windows
the problem is finding a large number of people to constantly practice with
I'd just join random games
ahh :/
the ones that show a level range in the title
i guess there is nothing wrong with that
except that I still suck
14bbl
then you perhaps need more than simple practice mode
*you
such as?
you still have the link of guides i showed you right?

Project natal interests me, I always lose controllers or run out of battery
we'll see how it is in the demos
I don't 100% see how it's going to work, but I suppose they're still developing/testing it.
I think its going to be an IR flood along with a camera with an ir filter
in order to see depth
4bye
This guy seems nervous.
LOL Justin Bieber.
all of these guides give you rune/masteries you should use. neither of which I can really have since I'm low leveled.
then don't use them
the rune/masteries that is
i mean they make a difference but they can't hinder you so much that it hurts the strategy
look i read the guides of a few champions
and one thing i learned
is that you don't only learn about how to use your character but you learn what other enemies are likely to do
Haha, crowd response.

"superbro This is the creepiest thing I've seen possibly ever #E3 #Skittles Does she know he's not real"
Haha.
Haha, "how many pushups can Chuck Norris do?"
arcues remix is epic
The skittles demo was weird because the little asian girl was actually acting like the tiger was licking her.
when it was 10 feet away on a screen.
I think the console should spray spit at you when the tiger is supposed to be licking.

14* The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
14moments.
14* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
14connection.
14* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
14that Firefox is permitted to access the web
/me shrugs
14XD
12Doesn't work on iE either..
12I wonder if this has been preventing people from registering :/
neither on Opera nor Firefox or IE
12Works on Chrome at least -v-
not for mine
/me checks IE
12I hate TST sometimes, fix one thing.. another thing goes wrong
03WOW, more lag fail
03I Just saw like 20 lines at once
14IE gave this
14The page is currently unavailable
14Due to current high demand, the page you are looking for cannot be delivered right now.
/me demands an answer
/me hides
who the hell calls himself ajb6400?
12A spambot
I kinda doubt Arti
12Well, then it must mean something
7back
12Initials I guess

12Yes?
7hi lyon
04heya Quan

03SIGH
03My Internet is failing so hard right now
03even *IRC* is lagging, and that's like, not much bandwidth at all
03I should go chuck my router out a window...
03brb while I go reset my router :|
12No I never even set a date
7hi lyon

13.-.
12of the site
7k
04hey
13What?
04what're you doing?
13Dunno lol
7Ooh, Lyon>?
12Also, i can't figure out where this problem is with the code
7One problem with your animated dA avatar:
04yes Quan?
04oh?
7Since it's a GIF, the gradient is ruined. D:
04lol
04fffff
04then what do I do?
it says "Method not allowed" and such
/me 7shrugs. :/
04I have to use UnFreez to animate Quan
maybe the wrong varaible type?
7GIFS only can hold 256 colors.
which isn't a problem so long as you only use 256 or slightly more
13I'm bored xD
04:|
04same
12I still can't see a problem
7hmm
7We could convert the other avvies so they are GIFs.
14DRAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14^v^
04but
12Mind you, the "Line 21" was pretty unspecific
04Quan

14and you mean "quiet"
14lol
7yes thanks
and continued to try to get my phone number after I told him I had a boyfriend
7#rp okami talk
/me wanted to experience his first face-punch
7Rp is for Role-playing.
he probably thought he could be like in those romance movies where he can outbeat the original boyfriend or something
06#okami was used for okami talk
14This channel is for whatever. :P
Probably
06err
06heck
06what was the name
But yeah, he got fired because he didn't do any work
7no i mean pretending your ammy
little does he know /I/ am a nerdy guy
7or issun
not a jock
He was a useless slacker
7or waka
:P
7My ammy what?
7Beach?
the nerd always gets the girl
7</pun>
according to Hollywood
14I don't get it but I still laughed for some reason. :/
And now he realized the hard way that's not gonna happen! Owned!
Well hopefully he has a life of his own now
XD
7Should I explain? :P
10Why's that?
7um want to pretend your an okami charotor?
7Maybe, if you clean up your text.
14Nah, then it won't be funny. ^^;
he probably is just hitting on another girl with a boyfriend now
7Okay. :P
lol
at Target this time
Yeah, because he specifically picks girls who he knows have boyfriends
hahahahahah
Just like James Bond
7I'll leave you to figure it out, then.
he thinks he /is/ James Bond I bet!
And of course I told the entire store about you before he asked me
Hahaha
14Like I said, I don't role play much anymore.
14You can use the phrase "retired role player" if you want. XD
14The governor is trying to cut a few million from the money that goes to the arts programs across the state :/
he wouldn't ask you out if that were the case
7Shure
he'd be like "This is a guy I don't wanna messs with"
:P
7So do you?
/me 14is sat all over.

14Why, Kyu? :<
7Technically, it should be 'vores', but that sounds odd.
07cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuz
"He likes Star Wars, books, and Xbox games! I have no chance!"
14Mhmm, so I'm writing a letter to the legislators because theyre going to vote on it tomorrow

then a bunch of scholarships she's been bugging me about
14And there's no way to get all three starters in your PokeDex without trading with friends or something.
DAWN THEM TYOPS
ahh
12XD
yes, I thought you meant like never
and I wasl ike "wtf" XD
14Lol, no, I was actually tempted to get Cyndaquil as a starter.
Telling me to do stuff 20 extra times makes me want to do it less
because all I can focus on is how annoying my mom gets
12shadow of doom
14But then I was like, "Water-Types are way better." So *click!* I got Totodile.
Yeah, I feel that way a lot too.
Although I'm not nagged very much.
lol, water types are cool :>
14I always get them at the beginning of my games. XD
my favorite type atm is, probably, fire
cocks
14But I might get the Fire-Type as a starter if I ever get the Black Version.
eh?
there's no such thing
14Pokemon White and Black?
ohhh
wait... wat? O.o
4in SS i would get cyndaquil

that's so stupid!
No it isn't.

14Not as stupid as the new Pokemon. <_<
Because that is stupid

14You can do EVERYTHING

14That's legal
03So legally from 18- 21 you are only half a man/woman :3

At 21 you stop being a woman and become a MAN

13Yeaaah... .|
10I don't think I've ever seen Digimon Frontier (season 4) before, but Data Squad was wtf-ish
10Oh wait, nvm I Google'd it
104th season was just as bad as the 5th
106th... Idk what I'm looking at right now
13I didn't even liked the 3rd season all that much :|
10D:
10That was my favourite
10along with the 1st

Hmm, Nintendo conference starting soon, wonder if they'll show any pokemon.
10Porbably the ones we already know about from CoroCoro
not really
Yeah, but if they do show anything, they'll show gameplay.
you think e3 is about pokemno?
they wont show us <censored>
Microsoft did.
So did EA.
All of them have shown gameplay so far.
gameplay we already seen
So?
wuts the point of that
They might show you stuff you haven't seen before, you wouldn't know.
they wont
How can you guarantee that?
E3 pokemon, hehe that would be like asking for no one to notice it
trust me
Well, we'll see soon anyway.
pokeymans

/me flooooooooofs all over Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"

10Floorplan =/= press conference guys
10They have an hour to reveal EVERYTHING - including the 3DS and Wii 2.0, plus the five+ other games they have announced
also demos
10Correct
STARTED
13Bbl guys I have to get some work done around the house. Cya later
^
Well all the others I've seen have had gameplays.
ALL of them.
And I didn't see anything in other languages.
10I don't think a demo seems likely for B/W either
lol demo of a pokemon game I never think that have been done
10we know nothing about the game as it is, and Nintendo has never given us a demo for Pokemon games in the past
10yeah
10lol
10each game has about a minute for the creators to reveal it, then the trailer, then maybe a gameplay trailer, and that's basically it
Some Xbox games got 20mins+ to show gameplay, etc.
Although this is only an hour
Lol, audience is much more enthusiastic than they were for Microsoft.

what
10The recent sports games have sucked, tbh
7come back and BAMB
Xbox kinnect/NATAL actually look quite interesting for upcoming games and future game prospects.
on chat?
7jo to #rp now ill show you there
7hit the green #rp
if they manage to keep it from becoming a gimmick then yes
i don't want games that say "ZOMG look at us we have motion control" I want games where it suits seemlessly in.
Well it is appropriate for in many games.
Hmm, another poor game.
10Ew
Oh, they made the same sort of game for Xbox, but with much better graphics, and it would actually work better, because of kinnect.
Some dancing game.
Hmm, I hope Sony has something interesting.
10I prefer DDR
Yeah, that's what many people said.
10it's more classy
DDR
is god
7?
7silver
7o.0
7sskylands
7skylands?
7?
I think its funny this same convo is going on in 3 different channels I'm in
"DDR without the floor pad? Fail"
Wth are they showing now?
10Dark Dawn
i'm interested in games but I can't even be bothered to watch xD
!espeon
|3
Nintendo conference is poor.
Ok, cya.
10Let me know what happens when I return
Sure.
Would anyone here become interested if I said: "New Goldeneye for Wii"?
LOL, strange name for a game.
what's the name
"Disney Epic Mickey"
it must be EPIC
Definitely. XD
12not reall
12y
Lol, 28k people in one chat.
"Epic Fail Mickey" <--- Some guy in the chat room.
cuboooooo
eeeee
I haven't been called that or cuno in ages
New Goldeneye for Wii just announced at E3 btw
12lol
I heard they were remaking it but didn't know it was for the wii......
I sold my wii...
anyway HI LUGIA XD
Heya Arti ;>
LOL
this is much easier than email
hello
7im
lol, quite true, and the E-mail doesn't keep increasing by 20kb each time ;>
7ORANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XD
ok...?
7?
7whos he?
Really? What happened?
And, did you make sure the site where you heard the dying rabbit on was an official site? ;p
I'm BLUE......!!!ZSHAGAA
14Yeh and I'm GREY
it wasn't an official site but was put together by reliable ppl
For one.
12hi grey
7o.0
They showed a game called "Disney Epic Mickey".
7lol
lol
You were censored by the cat.
:P
Also "Mario Sports Mix".
And "Mii Party".
Crap games.
tomorrow is just Wednesday to us
Zelda game was crap too, sensitivity and responsiveness were just rubbish.
Oh, God... they're fighting a losing battle when Sony and MS come out with the better motion tech.
the next week is going to go SO slowly you know
This is how they expect to compensate? :P
but regardless, just a few more days of over working myself and then it is 15 days off work ^v^
Mmm, Xbox kinnect seemed very accurate and advanced.
Well, not for me, for you maybe ;>
I still have a LOT of things I need to get done >>
So does the Move.
lol
But yeah, Kinect looks stunning.
LOL
"They know Kirby's got game"
xD
and I'm just counting down days
Move?
So, how many days? ;p
9
lol
XD
well, 8 before I fly ^^
Yeah, it's Playstation's motion tech.
also a new kirby game.
a very off one
More is supposed to be mentioned about it today.
*dd
Except a part of me died inside watching Microsoft's conference.
9 till you arrive in Yeadon
Just ask SR about "Skittles".
Which one, where they explained Kinect and the new 360?
ffs that quit message took up the whole screen almost
Ah, true
I dunno, it was live streamed yesterday.
7..
Sony's is after Nintendo's which finishes soon.
I think it's the same one. I only saw part of it.
dot dot
I still need to figure out what busses/trains to take from Leeds to Yeadon ^^'
LOL
The new Kirby game.
LOL.
Is called...
"Kirby's Epic Yarn"
WTH
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
I will probably need to direct you to the station but the city. centre is very linear so it'll be easy
from where the bus stops you, I think you just go straight up, left, right, left and you're there LOL
Well, I was thinking about getting and printing directions from google maps, but I remember the last time I didn't know I had to actually flag down a bus >>
LOL
OMG I REMEMBER THAT
What the hell is it about?
I need to start getting ready to leave >> Can't get home too late, nice hot chicken dinner is waiting for me XD
7LOL
Oh, the people in the chat room (30k of them), actually like this Metroid game they just showed though.
But there is a few odities in the UK I must try to remember, as to not make myself look like a fool again ^^'
ok
like...?
What's the title?
Metroid Other M
whispering infront of people?
Not to wisper around the dinner table and the difference between chips and crisps
lol XD
Ah, so it's not part of the Prime series.
XD
Interesting.
So it is not to wisper around anyone? ovO
yes..
it just gets worse and worse...
A Donkey Kong game.
And also that coke over there tastes funny ;p
well not right infront of them
I hope it's not called Epic Donkey Kond.
Haha, title?
Kong*
Haven't said yet.
I hope it's Epic Donkey Kong.
And right behind them? ;p
Anyway...
its ok if they don't see it happening... look its hard to explain XD
They haven't even mentione the 3DS yet though.
lol, just stupid paranoid English people *hides*
Evidently that Kirby game has been pushed back and forth since 2005. xD
Oooh, what's that.
?
D:
hi!
10So...
nintendo just announced at e3 that they're remaking goldeneye
Not 100% sure, people keep saying "SHOW 3DS NOW SKIP THIS CRAP"
10anything interesting?
for wii
LOL
Ahh, here we go.
lol
3D play on nintendo DS is on the way.
sorry :>
7POKEMONZ!!!!
lol didn't see
The graphics on the portables suck, how could they pull off 3D?
:P
3das
3ds*
10oh wow, a Goldeneye remake
I still need to make a list of the things I can do for when you are at work Arti ;>
Yeah, Goldeneye remake looked good.
And will the Golden eye game make use of the wii motion plus?
You missed some pretty crap title names though.
like make me lunch
10Kirby on Wii, finally
10I missed the gameplay though
not that I would by a wii, or any console for that matter ^^'
I also find it funny that both the DSi and the DS Lite are more expensive than the Wii at this point.
They're doing 3D without 3D glasses.
Somehow.
I'll make you some fish and chips, with vinigar ^v^
10Epic Yarn sounds odd
....
I hate you
Oh, that's the trend lately. A lot of games are supposed to have that. -shrugs-
How? O_o
now they're talking about the 3DS
Felling is mutual ^v^
*feeling
"Disney Epic Mickey" as well.
You tell me.
Maybe I will.
10Haha, what are they thinking
how does the 3DS even work
I know if you add dimensions on a screen, it can seem a bit more "poppy".
I know this is a bit random and off topic, but could someone please tell me what makes a console better then a pc...?
they say you don't need to use 3d glasses
exactly
The guy explaining can barely speak English.
so HOW does it work?
7?
you can sit right next to your friends
the question is appearently why they're not thinking
Would probably used layered screens
on a sofa
You can slide something on the side to adjust how 3D is it. O_________o
How the hell?
with huge screen
I gtg
I can do the same with my computer ovO
take care!
need to do security checks before I leave at night
bye!
And with that I will leave as well ^v^
it's going to be 3d depth rather than jumping in your face 3d, so it'll be something to do with the screen
Not yet.
http://www.ustream.tv/e3
If you feel like watching it.
Oh, thanks.
Slide pad?
prince
told ya
no pokemon
Oh well, they still showed a couple DS games.
xD The accent is overwhelming.
Take photos and view them in 3D...
Hmm.
I don't get this.
Me either.
This is so odd.
7...
WANNA BRUNTHER!
Looooooooool.
What's Project Sora?
Sora? I don't know, I don't follow Nintendo much.
They've pretty much lost my interest.
Oh, another Kid Icarus?
lol pit
Some of these games, like the GoldenEye remake, would be really good if they weren't on wii.
I know! GoldenEye especially.
I just find most games are really awkward to control on wii.
I use the GC controller whenever it's supported.
I don't have any. :/
hi everybody!
I'm sure you could get one for basically nothing online.
7hello
Hmm, I should get one.

"Who else just had a nerdgasm?" Nope, just you, buddyu.
*buddy
Hahaha.

07but it's not warm enough
i dont know a way to do it in 1 go, yours is +- as good as mine
10Whoops
:C
OK
Hmm, I've seen the start of this clip on one of the other conferences.
Can't remember which one though.
/me feels a bit tired
12I have a question
yes
12You know in HG/SS when you fight a Pokemaniac..
12WHAT costume is he wearing!?
12Is it.. a Pokemon..?
12Because I can never recognise it for some reason
i dont know sorry
14No, I think it's just a dinosaur of some sort...
it's your mom
/me runs
14I've never paid attention to it so
oh yeah it is
yeah, It hink it is
12But they don't have horns
14I mean, has he EVER worn a Pokemon costume in ANY of the games?
12It has a big horn and it's green
10that, or Larvitar
AFAIK"
12Yeh I thought it was a charizard costume before
10or a simplified Rhydon
14I think it's just a costume that makes no sense, to be honest.
12http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/1/1f/RSE_PokeManiac.png
Huh... how did North Korea managed to get a goal on Brazil? ... Impressive, even though they still lost. :P
it dosnt have a scar down its eye skylands
12What?
12You're kidding
12What was the score in the end?
Oh, valve finally.
12http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/8/83/FL_PokeManiac.png
Brazil 2:1 People's Republic of Korea
12Omg Lol
14Okay, you've proven your point. XP
12I am impressed too
Portal 2 on PS3. :o
Portal 2 on PS3. :o
12YAY I FOUND IT
12http://www.iaza.com/work/100319C/PokeMonster_A8734864107-iaza.gif
14Ewww portal
cool
/me reads the thread it's posted on
Also, the PRK didn't concede a goal until the 55th minute... which was mildly impressive.
12I wonder if it has any info..
14See? It's just a weirdo dinosaur thing.
14obviously not a Pokemon
Portal 2 sounds fun, but I hate it at the same time
yeah...
i know
14Unless it's a foreshadow of the fifth generation, which wouldn't really surprise me. XD
12"it's just supposed to be 'Pokemon-ish' thing without being anyone in specific, the creature itself looks like a simplified Rhydon."
i weird
12......Weird..... Skylands said that EXACT phrase lol
and I agreed :P
lol
10[16:25] or a simplified Rhydon
10that's what I said
12Yes
that's what she said
oh
/me hides
12Ovo
12Thats what I pasted Skylands LOL
10wait, where did it say that?
12Read it again all the way through
12XD
12I just pasted the whole sentence so it would make sense
10No, I meant where did you find that sentence at?
12Oh sorry
12XD
i think the red gayrados looks weird i caught it on my first go in HH/SS
12A random forum!
12When I googled for Pokemaniac!
hmmmm final fantasy xxiv
10Link it
Wth, how many FF games are they going to make? FF14...O______________________o

12Of course it's shiny
siries*
geez 13 hasnt even been out a year yet i think
have you got your pokemon to lv50 yet
12No
Wow, what the hell.
10I guess the phrase applies to this, "Two great minds think alike"
10:3
Multiplayer assassin's creed content? Huh...?
i hope you beat lance have you got ice pokemon
12Yeh I just can't believe that XD
and so do dumb ones
/me runs
as my mom's friend would say
10Too bad Rhydon's shiny form isn't green
10it'd make perfect sense
long as they sell they won't stop making them....
if you dont have ice pokemon lance would kill you
cos he has dragon pokemon
LOL @ microsofts sorry excuse for an E3 man it was oretty bad
Yeah.
same
SR and I were laughing about "Skittles". XD
12I always win with my Victreebel and stuff
I just (ab)used Ho-Oh
/me runs
>_> wouldve love one of the free 360's though
XD
12I never use legends
12Until i've beaten the person already
well aren't you special
I use the main legend
10My legendaries sit in a PC full of dust :P
like, the one you get before the E4
Haha, I love the way everyone says "Call of Doody".
12I know I'm special :3
... no way my pokemon where above lv50 and i didnt win
it sucked
12Oh great there goes my confidence LOL
10^ Mine were too
maybe you just suck at battling
/me runs
mine were like 55 I think?
12I have NO idea what awaits me
now, the final guy was tough, I had to use about 20 Revives
but I DID get him
14I beat the Elite Four on SS with level 45-60's
12Wow DRF you SUCK XD
it was close, I won on my last PokÃ©mon who was in the red
no i beat the elite 4 but not lance...
it was nuts
XD Arti, well it worked
12I beat the entire Elite Four in Platinum with no items, infact I got through the first three without saving even XD
14XD
...wow
LOL
I save before teh first
and only then
12I just thought it would be funny to go in and give it a try but not save because I wasn't actually planning on winning, just wanted to see what the first person had
not between
as if I get stuck...;]
12Then I just kept going
your good arti
14The second run through of the Elite Four on Platinum I used 4 revives and 3 full restores XD
wow that face was not intended
it was a typo
12LOL!
but ;] could be a face
anyway
I'm almost done with work for the day
stop distracting me >_>
/me runs
14no

12Linking images as your avatar does this really annoying thing though :/
it looks funny
12It shows the picture at 150x150 no matter what the size, then it quickly resizes it
o.o
I love when you complain about your own site
/me hides
12If I upload the pic, then it goes all fished up
12Haha
yes gran turismo 5!
12Me and Lugia are going to try and fix some of the glitches when he arrives
12Refresh my avatar now..
i love this site arti ^^
12That is what happens when I save the picture and then upload it....
welcome
Wow.
GT5 sometimes looks photoreal to me in that preview.
14Why are Eevee Eggs so hard to hatch? ><
14XD
no pic just a cross at the top
12Nevermind
1410000+ steps needed for Eevee eggs lo
14lol*
14I can tell. I've had this darn thing all day.
because they evolve into about 8-9 evvolutions
147
14This is only the first one, too. ><
Hehe, this is a hilarious comment in a bit of source code related to a tape drive, driver: "WROTE THIS ON LSD - DON'T ASK HOW IT WORKS, IT JUST DOES"
14I'm pretty sure evolution has nothing to do with it, though...
14I've got my eeveelutions :P
because they are rare
14Well, nyah to you. :P
14They're not that rare...
14You get one for free from Bill. XD
14Took me about 2 hours to get them

12Woah
OH GOOD LORD

USU3490G9Z <-- that serial number is so messed up
0/O, Z/2, etc
I can't get it to work in the warranty checker >_>
>_> i wonder if it willg et delayed again....
14Wow that pic is amazing @Link
12Yeh ^^
12I wish I could make backgrounds like that!
12I can't do detail
Wow, that's just plain awesome. (Referring to pic.)
12Wow
12Nice Lugia
14I love that pic lol
heh
sigh, fricking HP
their warranties... ugh
Very nicely drawn.
14I wish I could do digital art that well...
I mean, I'm supposed to look it up, but I can't
cute!
14I wish I could do digital art full stop XD
I wish I could do any form of visual art.
so do i
(Technical drawings don't count as art, right? :P )
14I'm more of a traditional artist, but I'm still not very good at that...
12I'm not good at any art lately
14I just suck full stop XD
you know what I can draw best?
stick figures
:D
14XD
14lol
Oh great... it appears Finale has decided to enborkify my latest MIDI... nice, very nice.
oh phew, found it
i can draw quite good
12I agree!
12That reminds me..
and the cars I draw look like potatoes with wheels
12But I couldn't approve it because you need to make your own album first
yes
oh
12I had nowhere to place it, I couldn't put it into the Lugia/Articuno/Other Bird Pokemon albums
oh
12You need to click "Create/Order My Albums" first and make an album to put any non Lugia/Arti/Bird stuff
(Finale... it's both good, and 04,01KILL IT WITH FIRE. It also costs an arm and a leg so I would have expected it to work slightly better.)
12Good thing you reminded me lol

I was also providing the link just for any one who is interested in knowing what a plotter is.

Now, I wonder what I can do with the plotter that won't cause me to get annoyed at it really fast...
im doing articuno and lugia at the minute
Haha.
I'm laughing at the people still screaming "KINGDOM HEARTS 3", and "SWTOR", even though it's finished.

14You know, Twilight, I thought the same thing some time ago...
14But look at me now. People think I have the ability to disappear and reappear.
03lol XD
14So if you come on as rarely as I do, you might gain that ability, too. XD
03XD
hi Twilight
I should be here more often, like I am now
during weekdays anyway
03Well, I can't read anymore manga until people translate the HG/SS PokeSpe manga XD

12oh
12i thought you said "dances to Ddr music"
14XD
14Well that shouldn't be very hard.
03LOL
14Dancing to DDR music is the general idea
03Ya think? X3
14:P
12instead of just beating it on guitar hero
12dancing to it must be harder
03>3<
14I haven't a hope in hell on beating it on StepMania XD
12that's what i just said
12lol
03The heck?
03EVERYTHING IN THE DRYER IS STILL DAMP
03So I just started it up for a third time >.<

14You should get a new dryer if it's terrible at its job.
14Fire it and hire a new one.

03What we need is a new dishwasher >.> Too bad we're only renting.
12i played too much phoenix wright
12i can't help myself XD
14It has obviously wronged Twilight by not fulfilling what is expected of it.
03I shall complain to my mom when she gets home XD
14Tell the dryer first that you'll complain to the managers if it doesn't get it right this time.
03LOL
12sigh
12i want to get all the phoenix wright games
12but i'm missing half of the 4
12i swear the remaining 2 are impossible to get hold of lol

03what's more fun is Rock, Paper, Chuck Norris
14But anyone can easily lie.
03but that's not important right now
7yep
12that's what the 3rd person is for
12you simply PM them your choice
12and he announces them
14That seems a bit too troublesome, though...
12if he lies
12then it will be detected
7yep

Zen: Your first solo or solo cross country?
solo.
I'm 15
Ahh
Me too!
And Texas is not bad at all
My first solo cross country is what got my nerves up
it is if you're a bisexual atheist liberal
/me matches two out of three
Just a TON of mexicans and they really do wear Cowboy hats
not bi?
Correct
and there's plenty of cowboy hats here
I hate where I live
rural cali is terrible
Zen: Soloing isn't too bad -- you see the airport, it's all good
No way to get lost
/me humps random people

Solo cross country, it's soooooooooo easy to get lost
this is cross-country

:O
I don't even have an xchat bot anyway
and I cba to pirate mirc
Hi Arma :3
you don't need to pirate mirc >.>
mirc is free
the demo is
the payment request is a lie
for 30 days
:3
it's a lie
I had the free trial
it keeps working
oh
lol
xD
After it was over it still worked
ehh, I like XChat anyway
me too ^^
But it reminds you to pay every once in a while
You can also mess with your registry too and lock the trial at 30 days
I use Icechat though
and I don't have to relearn it when I reboot
Ello'
So that it stays at 30 days until 2032
mIRC is finicky on linux
Because I felt guilty about not paying for it <.<
xchat is native
I'm here early because of the great things revealed at e3 this year.
xchat's better than mirc in some ways
If anyone cares, just say something.
it's way more lightweight
better support for multiple networks
is xchat free?
mirc has a huge mem footprint
and yeah
um, kind of
it's GPL
the linux version is free, the windows version isn't, but someone made a free version of the windows version
Huh
that's old then,
which you can find by looking up ychat
because the newest WIndows one's free
ychat is the newest windows version as far as I know
I dunno,
but if you actually go to the xchat official website it asks for money
i'm running XChat
and it's free
Just being hungry :3
huh
You?
ychat
I just ate lol
/me uses Konversation
http://xchat.org/windows/ says it costs $19.99
www.xchat.org
huh
You can legally pirate XChat
um, let me find the ychat website
How can you "legally pirate"?
Isn't that kind of an oxymoron?
you can legally pirate WinXP
I run TinyXP and Ubuntu in a dualboot
o.o
http://www.silverex.org/news/
Well, I prefer torrenting legal files
HAI
I torrented TinyXP, but that's legal
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XChat#Shareware_controversy
14:3
so yeah
I want to set up Win7 in a dualboot
/me did a lot on SS
Yay Ruins of Alph.
/me has XP and 7 is uninstalled
my pc came with Vista,
Yay puzzles.
14xD
EEEEWWWWWw
but I'm sure you can imagine how long I stuck with Vista
No yay catching them
:D
moreover, it's an HP
why do you need XP and 7 at the same time?
:D
:D
:D
I finally figured out that one panel that said Water.
And it ment water stone :x
XD
You slapped too hard!
what's a *good* free IRC program then
Yay, Rho!
:.:.:.:
I don't wanna mess with XChat if it's all whiny
xchat for linux or ychat for windows are pretty good
There we go
Hello!
Zen: KVIrc is a good one if you like features
lol
ychat is basically xchat but free
Lol, i used to use Pidgin's IRC
12xD
/me recovers from the slap
I like icechat
it has a few problems but they're pretty minor
icechat is term though, right?
What do you mean?
it's in a terminal window
like, it isn't GUI
telnet \o/
«Zen» Depends
I have used everything
I'm not sure what you mean by a terminal window <.<
umm
command prompt
Oh
a terminal window is kind of like command prompt
same thing
My favorite, while being less powerful than most, is Chatzilla
No, it's not then
basically
basically
I used chatzilla,
jinx :p
Not terminal
but I don't run FF anymore
irssi is Terminal
chatzilla is such a ram hog
Dont need it open
FF had weird closure issues
Not at all
I'm on Opera now
which has it's own IRC thing, but it sucks
brb
I drank coffe
e
maybe I should try Opera... Chrome is kind of annoying >.>
http://www.icechat.net/site/
the old versions might have been
I've been told the newest version of Opera is pretty good, and faster than Chrome.
Looks like it from some of the screenshots
14Hm?
hurray for sleeping all day and being awake all night
«Zen» one of the most AMAZING ones I have ever run is mIRC with a little script
well, I hope it doesn't forget important things like Chrome did
Opera is great
Called Invinceable
what's wrong with Chrome?
it's fast, and it isn't opensource
well
Chrome is just weird
lol
I dislike how it handles things
my main concerns are that Chrome doesn't have a view image button in the right click menu
and also that the tabs just keep cramming themselves in
o.o
without scrolling
sounds like me lol
It does for me
no it doesn't
it has open image in a new tab
not open image in a current tab
But yeah, Chrome is my favourite browser.
I dislike it's process management
/me is making a summer mix playlist to burn on a cd :D
FF
Oh
I like having everything in one process
o.o
FF!!!!!
:D
14Feather! ^^
I like Chrome
/me glomps
when you're looking at 20 pictures and you want to see them all independently you'll have to open 20 more tabs >.>
I used to use FF, but I hate it now, too slow.
and I loved Firefox,
until it died
oh speaking of which, I got the Warped 2010 cd
only $6!
is it good??
ooh
I'm going out for a bit, brb
KVirc has a winamp plugin
I like it better than the 2009 one
Library
how cool, and simultaneously useless
03finally, got some dress shoes that don't HURT
no Aiden or Madina Lake this time though :P
14XD
obviously coz they're not on the tour :P
Chrome is okay if you don't open lots of tabs and don't view lots of images >.>
03also I swear, my mom is trying to hook me up with girls
/me does both though :(
is alesana, emarosa, or I can make a mess like nobody's business on it??
14LOL!
03the salesperson was this somewhat hot girl, right
03and my mom's like
oh really? Aiden is on the back cover
03when she walked into the back room to get the shoes
03my mom was like "She's cute, eh? *nudge*"
alesana and emarosa are
03I was like ">_> yeah I guess"
03then as we were walking out
14Hahaha oh god, I remember when my mUm used to do that XD
03my mom was like "Well, she's older than you... but then again, some girls go for younger guys"
03"You wanna go back in there and ask her out? :P" and I was like "NO"
ffffff<3
03and she's like "Are you finally starting to be interested in girls?" and I was like "I Have been for years... being interested in GIRLS is different than being interested in DATING them"
Chrome gets pretty memory hungry once you have more than 10 tabs open.
I have 10 tabs open in Chrome - less than usual.
14XD
I'll brb
And Chrome's CPU usage is ~10-15%.
I generally end up with like 20+ tabs... and it's annoying when they bunch up so you can't tell which tab is what
there we go
oh
the reason Chrome opens each tab in a new process is so that if one tab crashes, the entire thing doesn't go with it
seen alesana live 3 times
yeah
I have yet to see emarosa but I saw jonny craig's solo act it was amazing
which I like ^^
03WTF @ the radio
haha, cool
I never have anything crash though
Opera's great
03some guy said as a vicious payback on his girlfriend, she slept with his brother
03BROTHER? WTF?
03He turned gay?!
Firefox has been a little crashy latley, but Ill continue to use it because ive grown acustom to it.
I did download and try Opera, but it just didn't become my regularly used browser for some reason.
Firefox ran great for me,
but when I closed it,
the process didn't die
14WTF
so I had to manually kill it
14Ovo
every time
Firefox always did that too
for me
it was so annoying
I'm sooooo00000ooooo0000000ooooooo excited for this year I wanna see I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's business it's an Ace Enders project :D <3

Yo
Firefox just won't start for me unless I start up another process.
It's strange.
do you try manually killing it?
You guys there?
because Firefox won't reopen if it crashes closed, and it always does as far as Iknow
But it won't start, so why would killing it help?
well
someone should make some consolidated program,
when I close Firefox, it crashes
and leaves it running in the background
that handles mail, IRC, and chat stuff
but NOT browsing
and Firefox won't reopen until I kill it
I like the beginning of the CD
03bbl goddamnit
opens up with blink then goes to Alkaline
yeah, that was what happened to me
I switched to Opera

They also revealed a new Xbox 360 with built in Wi-Fi and 250 GB HD. It will start shipping this week. Other than that we got to see some gameplay footage of Call of Duty: Black Ops, Halo: Reach, and Gears of War 3. Thoughts? Do you think this is enough for <<-cu

You're continuing... D:

Our hinge actually snapped off from overuse XP
03they announced it, then they said itw as an April Fool's joke, then they said it was't
03and I broke it :/
10http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5623.0
They wouldn't repair it
12back
03I took it apart and compeltely FRIED the motherboard
lol, I know several people who prove that wrong
03accidentally obviously
12o3o
03and Nintendo said they'd fix it for $70
12blah
02Go to Serebii, that's where i found it
02and wb
^exactly my point
03so I sent it to them
12drf
:P
03then they told me it was too old to fix
12my PSP had that happen
03and gave me a free DS lite
03:/
06so how old is that?
03old.
12somehow the Motherboard or w/e died
ah
03I said broken hinges on the *Lite*
03on the phat, they won't fix it for free
7thegeusst can we make it so absol is asleep
03Lite they will.
12and I had to pay $90 to fix it >>;
02About 6-7 years I think @Roara
12o3o
03as NIntendo finally admitted to making crappy hinge designs on iut XD
03*it
what do you mean by 'this market'
06because they know the Lite is crap
Job market
03LL, heh, I hacked my PSP the day I got it, so :P
06yeh
it kind of sucks right now
03Aurora, well it's not CRAP, it's just flimsy :/
12nice o3o
02And heck, why pay $70 to fix it when I can get a complete new one for $65? XD
03I do like the brigher screens
the economy is [censored] at the moment
The job market is ridiculous nowadays. You must have college stuffz or you're doomed.
03where?
/me actually plays REAL UMDs drf o3o
03EW
06my Phat is marvelous still, except I think the battery life is plummeting
/me hides
03UMD discs are SO SLOW x.x
10:3
03it's like 5x faster with a hack
03I'm serious
03I rented a UMD
02I told my mom she has to pay half because she broke it
12they ARE slow ><;
03and was like "LOADLOADLOADLOAD WHY IS THIS SO SLOOOOWW"

03it's instant
7ok the geusst
03:)
02So I'm only paying $65, and she's paying $65
12mine would be like: NO!
video editing doesn't require a degree or anything if you start from the bottom and prove yourself up
02plus shipping *flees*
12@Shiny
03oh
12lolz
03well
06wtf, why not her pay all of it
Actually, the manure comapnies are doing fine, so I agree.
03I would have had to pay all of it
03XD
06if she broke it
*companies
06mine would lol
10same XD
12mine wouldn't >:|
03my mom would make me pay all of it
12in fact...
02That's what I was thinking, but she's like "I don't have enough money for it"
03since she doesn't touch my electronicds
03-d
03so it can't be her fault
03>_>
I like how "comapnies" sounds
02And then about a month later she buys all this paint and stuff for the house
7what are we talking about
12my grandmother threatened to smash my iPod with a hammer before >>;
03NICE
co-map-knees
Sounds like "come at me."

I wanted to fix something on one of the tutorials

03XD
XD

12aaaand cue drf
/me hides
I slept through Sony's Press conference today though, so I missed them showcasing the new controller
03..DX
03*XD
/me 2floats about
Hullo. ;3
12hi kipi
;4
03;5
Quilava

Me too. xD
2hi kipi
Ha, they're going 3D too

lol
Did you hear about the 3DS?
Yeah
12Liiiiiink o3o
I don't see it

I saw that today
Lame. :/
03I don't watch E3 >_>
http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/553,CATCH+HIM+!!!
03all the good footage will be online within a day anyway
2haneehs
2hi
03that, and EW COMCAST
2ih
Miyamoto bombed the showcase of the new Zelda game
03Comcast owns G4
onihsoy
ih
hi
03so I kinda avoid it if at all possible
it was embarrassing watching it
screw that
=/
lol
what's wrong with a good old controler
Really?
you got to admit that is pretty darn funny
I like the Wii, but I wish the other two consoles would stay traditional
Obvious Wii ripoff is obvious
i'm tempted to keep that skin installed XD
aparantely they have others
It even looks the same
XD
only with that light up ball
which makes it look ridiculous
many others
there is a zapdos anivia
:P Golden Eye was confirmed for the Wii though.
The 360's answer to the Wii is a camera that allows gaming without a controller
but it looks gi[censored]y to me
XD
XD
http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/224
stupid m i c k
I personally don't care for that, but I know a few people here do
12lolz
Why is that even censored? xD
I dunno
it's not even considered offensive
Kinect is revolutionary.
You may not slander it.
Screw Kinect
Bolt it.
/me slanders it
Give me a traditional controller
XD The controller started messing up because of "wireless interferance".
I was on your will?
:O
hmmm
You all are.
lol
Yes, even Amelia.
12LOL
Theyasked everyone to turn off their cellphones
12LOLOL!
It was so sad!
No... no... not him.
12but blah
/me 2lag
Oh, OK
I get his Star Wars stuff
that's what I thought
or not
12I can't feel happy about that being funny :(
/me WANTSSSSSSSSS!
You may inherit those old cards I told you asbout.
doesn't really look like zapdos
*about
but it's close XD

mkay
if I die you may have my dog
who is a spoiled brat
/me lols randomly
I wasn't as impressed by the new Zelda as I would've expected
Okay, but I'll chain it up and feed it vegetables.
12you sould like Roara
Sounds good
12I suppose you too wanted it to be more TP-ish?
that'll probably be good for him
02Sound*?
Yeah, i think it would
He really is a spoiled brat
12ty Shiny ._.
By what way?
How about chocolate, then?
No chocolate
>:)
/me has been typoing since I got on today, Shiny o3o
He doesn't deserve it
12graphics-wise
/me 7noms the new zelda
Graphics mean nothing. I was referring to just the basic gameplay.
Chocolate isvery bad for dogs, BTdubbs.
7yummy
12take Zelda, Nine
*is very
ehhhh it could be more accurate
It looks nearly the same
12I missed that, Kipi, so Idk it
but oh well
12ah?
12it's hack-and-slash Wii style?
BTdubbs?
02Is it becoming like Pokemon now? |D
btw
ah
7,,
But "more accurate".
12ah
7OMG link would have bulbssaur
12Wii Motion Plus, I suppose?
12D:
12NU!
7heh
12he would have ME!!!
/me hides
7o.o
12ah
12well
12they're still making it o3o
02YOU'RE NOT WELCOMED HERE!
/me is shot
Indees.
12remember back before WW was made?
/me 7nums ll ear
12everyone expected what became TP
7yum
12but we got WW first o3o
/me avoids
02Btw LL, guess what I saw at the locale video rental store
7:(
7pokemon
Metroid is still the only new Wii game I'm interested in. XP
by the way, I need to get this out of my system
12lolz
*ahem*
12wat Shiny?
New Zelda game looks awesome!
okay, done
12and Kipi: I'm actually just "meh" about Other M
02Brown haired Link adventures lol
12EWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!
Kirby looks fun, but it'd be better as a DS game, as would te Donkey Kong game.
/me plays "E-Mission - Kryptic Mix"
12Kipi
BAM
yes
!!!
12the Kirby game...
12how similar is it to K64?
Not very. o.o
02N*
12awwwwwww ;3;
There's a rumor it kills themif they have too much at a time.
02No such thing as K64 sadly ;v;
/me REALLY wants a Kirby 64 remake T.T
It looks completely different to tradition Kirbys, and not just because of the art style
...?
12really? o3o
Oh, chocolate
12any good?
I thought you meant Zelda
He has a whip now
12I JUST tuned in RIGHT after the Zelda ga-wat
02Well that sends a message to the older audience
/me FLEES
12a whip?
12Kirbiana Jones wat
lol
/me hides
03LOL
/me applied to be a beta tester of FFXIV
It's yarn, but works as a whip
:D
/me applauds LL for the idea
12is that a permanent weapon in-game?
So does Kid Icarus, though I'm not a fan.
I nearly died laughing at the "Kirby's Epic Yarn."
Kirby: EPIC Yarn
/me bows
^ You would. :P
12LOL
yay plugins
03CAN I STEAL YOUR IDEA? XDD
XD that's the title
12NUUUUU! D:
:D
03D:
12Kirbiana Jones is MY idea!
I want to listen to some moar opl3 music now
/me gets Trademarks and such!
03lol, there goes the fanfic XD
Yes, the yarn whip is permanent
/me plays "Mindless Self Indulgence - Never Wanted To Dance"
From the looks of it
Yeah, they both looked awesome too
Look up, "Kirby Epic Yarn" to see the screenshots
I love me some MSI
Nintendo's rep was using Japanish.
but I, being a Zelda fantard, can only feel the hype for that one at the moment
I could never get into Zelda.
They should've showed Pokemon B&W
Well
Well
I don't have a DS D:<
/me cries
12all I know about that series is Issac has big hands o3o
/me hides
wat
Aww. >:P I'll just gloat to you when I get it
it gets good once it turns from an action adventure into a puzzle game
/me flees
Nah, I've just never played it
which all Zelda games do eventually
Doesn't interest me much
12don't even think about covering my nostrils
12Issac has big hands o3o
Also
Yeah, I also don't have a Wii.
Don't rub it in DDDDDD:<
The 3DS is apparently going to have Gamecube quality graphics
o,o
DDDDDDDDD:
If that's true, then I'm sold.
12are you serious? o3o
12Gamecube? o3o
/me and Nalex are discussing about killing Lance with a Pidgeonmissile.
/me smells a new Mariokart game...
/me hides
It may be exagerated, but 's what I heard said.
Does anyone know how to set the default quit msg in KVirc?
12lolz
There might be a new Animal Crossing for it too. :3
06this online course is burning my brain into mush
and the 3D is adjustable
Aurora
is it DELICIOUS?
:|
owo
06NO :|
I can understand that, too. There are lots of games that I always hear people talk about and they just don't interest me at all
/me stops using flamethrower on Roara's brain
so I guess I'm not a fantard
:P
12lolz Shiny
:O
but
12why stop now? o3o
/me hides

Hello~

Wait, so you made my tail look like my tail?
Yup
/me huggles Shiny~
Cuz it looked like a potato before
02a floofy potato
/me is going to bring his DS to work tonight
Ecco.

03to get it
03that was before I knew you could pirate VC games, XD
I own the wii version and a copy of the game in-box
03I don't have it for N64...
Of course you don't

03oh
03well
03the reason I can say it's a DS Lite
03the screen is still 4:3

03you'll see black bars on the top and bottom
03:P

But it is graphically capable of GC style graphics
03I heard

03I could make a video just like that

livestreaming; the thing that beats coffe
2idk
2o3o
7PLZ
Ah
2._.
Well, I'm within reason, then
7ill give you cookies
I use Linux :3
I run a dualboot
7 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 of them
Which doesn't have a registry
Linux is good, but it's not perfect
nor is XP
I use XP
You gotta pick your poison
/me 2ponders first.
XP is a cool smiley
I'd rather have Windows :P than Windows XP
7o3o
xD
Zen: Beat you to it :P
and I wish my D: drive was a :D drive
also, I lag like 2 seconds
I lag like 50ms
My friend installed Jollicloud on a dualboot but I never use it
But I type slow
i lag 2000
what the hell is jollicloud
I have 0.0 lag showing in xchat
that's an os
Netbook OS based on Ubuntu
Oh
i see
do you have a netbook?
Yeah
ok
I'm getting a new laptop soon though
I have a desktop, so I run normal Ubuntu
I'm thinking about UbuntuStudio though
seems good for me
I'm probably too used to Windows to use anything else
>.>
Linux is actually closer to Windows than Mac is,
at least in terms of shell
uhhh
MAC
IT BURNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
XD
lol
I love the OSX UI,
Mac is based on Unix, Linux is based on Unix, Windows is *not* based on Unix
but I hate apple in general
yeah, ari, I know
the KERNELs are different
/me 2yawns
You have all sorts of the same commands in Mac too
but Linux/Gnome is closer to windows,
than Leo
sudo, rm, mv, all sorts of stuff
Ohhhhhh
i'm talking solely about the shell, dude
did you add me yet?
When you say shell, do you mean the appearance, or the actual shell?
appearance
Ah!
not bash
That makes more sense
7draws lugia
And I haven't added you yet
ic
KDE looks more like Windows Vista/7
ehh,
I dunno
I had vista
Well, actually, Vista/7 looks more like KDE :P
At least 7

02Your gallery
KDE is really weird
7ello?

KDE3 is wierd, KDE4 is nice though
Hmm
7im your pet
2nooo

2i thought you were SA's pet
7i can draw growlite
I didn't like how buggy KDE3 was
2:U

7any more
I still run Ubuntu 9.10 Jaunty
err

02I'll try to keep myself awake
06lol, don't push it
7k
7me too
5Mmmkay. So I have a dilemma with my PokÃ©mon Gold game.
06o-o?
5I can't decide if I should get Ho-oh and Lugia /now/...
7?
2o:
7lugia
5...or if I should go fight the Elite Four and THEN go after them.
06hmm
06what's your team now
5I have all eight badges now.
5Umm....
7lugia
5It varies. ^^;
06wait
5I already have a Suicune~
7elite 4
06gold version
06you can't catch lugia until you get to kanto
5And my Ampharos is freaking level 43.
5You can't?
7..
5Oh fff.
2lol
06you meet an old geezer in pallet town
7to weak
5xD
06who will give you the feather of the opposite bird to your game
5Ooohhh. I thought I had something.. Oh wait, it was the /Rainbow Feather/ that I had.
7ampohas
5Does that mean I can go find Ho-oh /now/ and capture it? :D
02IT'S OVER 9000!
7ho oh
02Sorry
06RP, yeah
06level 40 Ho-oh
2i think
2o3o
5Okay cool.
02That was just on the TV lol
7yep
7...
5Really? I though Ho-oh on Gold was like... um... Lv. 50 or so.
5In the Burnt Tower.
06nope
5RIP-OFF.
5./shot
7um yep
06it's 40 and 70, the lower level being for the respective bird of your box
06the higher being the opposite
5Ooohh. That's kind of strange.
06in Crystal, both were level 70
5I actually have a Mewtwo that I kind of used my Gameshark to get 'cause I REALLY REALLY wanted one but it's sitting in my PC at level.. 19 or something. xDD It's insulting to the species (of one LOL), but I don't care.
2lol
5Knew I should've gotten Crystal haha.
7lol
7rp watch out for missinino
5I wouldn't have Gameshark'd Mewtwo except for the fact that he's not available in G/S/C... --;
06level 19 is insulting
5Missingno? Haha.
06and blasts everything away
06:P
5xD Yeah.
5BLOW UP STUFF SON. /shot
02You sound like Blaine
02I MEAN
02hi there o3o
7lol attack of the mews from you tube
5My whole "plan" has been to just train Mewtwo and have him in my party just for the heck of it. Like, I wouldn't use him in any League/gym battles.
5./shot for actually knowing that
7..
5o3o
02That's what I was referring too LOL
02to*
5Oh nice~ ;D
7..
5Never did figure out what happened to those two after the FR/LG volumes of the manga...
02I only read up until a bit into the Gold/Silver manga
7omg rare pokemon
7good
02Number?
7 7
7 6
02Lol mmk
5So I was up until the wee hours of the morning last night (if that makes any sense) reading (mainly bad) PokÃ©mon fanfiction. It was kind of entertaining.. some of it.
2LOL
02Hey I stayed up till 3 AM just watching (yes WATCHING) Final Fantasy 13 (the game)
02I hear there's a movie, so that's why I said the game btw XD
5I constantly find myself disappointed over and over at the unoriginality of so much of it. It makes me sad as a writer. ):
5There's a Final Fantasy XIII?
5Good God. x___x
06I want to finish my fan fic so badly
02LOL there's already a trailer for Final Fantasy 14!
5Which one Roara?
06but the 80-chapter prediction intimidates me
02Rifted?
06and I have SO much to do this summer
06Shiny, don't even remind me about rifted
06that one too x-x
06that one's 40 chapters
06so
06120 chapters total
02Just go slow
06and my life is that of an artist, not a writer :|
06I have been slow
06WAY slow
02Why not make it into a comic then?
5I want to finish my most popular fanfiction by the end of the summer, but I haven't worked on it in almost /two years/. But while I was wiling away the hours I got SO INSPIRED to pick it back up.
06even worse lol
02You have the ideas and the artistic talent to do so
02Even if they're just fast doodles
5Ditto on Shiny's comment.
7,,,
5Your fast doodles are better than my finished projects. (Some of 'em. xD; )
06knwoing me, I'd try cramming everyhting into those stories
06and how I have my stories plotted out, it would be very difficult to turn into a comic
02Trial and error
06speaking of fast doodles, I forgot to upload
02You learn and you make :3
5Um... "Show don't tell", like everything? (: It's just the same with comics.
02Fff, my chain's up to 32 now
7..
7lucy
06there we go :)
7no 8
02Nice
5TEN MINUTES?!?!?
02to both
06yeah
5That would've taken me like six hours!! xD
06woulda been faster, I wish it was, but I decided to screw something up -_-
02That would've taken me...2 years or more
5That's awesome!
02Just to get the skills to actually draw it .-.
5(I just realized I am procrastinating on my legendary PokÃ©mon project. Hurhurhur.)
7orly
5Yarly. >__>;;
/me 2yawns
2brb
7..
02Oh..
02Getting dizzy
5I made the mistake of starting with the cleanup of Myuutsu's sketch, 'cause now that means I have to go back and do the hard PokÃ©s after him. ><
/me curls up on Roara's back
/me plooof
7well shiny you win
7night all
02Night o.o
7you get a shiny
7shiny
02Lol
02I haven't gotten it yet
7heh well night
02So uh...anyone want a shiny Skitty?
06lol I remember I always wanted one so badly
06I prefer regular now tbh
5Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinyyyyyyyyyyy....
5I have exactly one shiny in my Gold version and it is -- of course -- the red Gyarados from the Lake of Rage. xD
02You've must've done a lot of soft resetting to get that one *shot*
5Maybe if I play long enough I'll find one randomly. o3o But I'm still waiting for the two other legendary beasts.
5Shiny, not really. xD; It only took me two tries. (My Flaaffy -- now Ampharos -- was beast.)
5I had an Ultra Ball and a lot of luck on my side, LOL.
02I'd say so XD
02Hey y'know
02I went into a cave to find a Lapras I think
02And I found a Shiny Swinub (this was in FR)
5Oh, nice. :D
06looool
5What? o-o
o3o
hey there - just popping in for short
02mmk o3o
5I stopped reading the bad fanfics and started rereading the good ones. xD; I couldn't take the pain anymore...
02I'm sure there's hundreds of bad fanfics out there
5Hey, y'know what? I should start a blog. About PokÃ©mon fanfics. Critique them, review them, tell people what's good, what's bad, and what's just plain predictable...
02*coughjustreadmineandyou'dfindoutcough*
5Now I wanna read it 'cause it's probably better than you think.
02So basically you're telling them why they're like Final Fantasy?
/me is shot
5My most popular fic I thought was just /weird/ when I first started thinking about it. People loved it.
5Somehow, they like reading fanfics about fanfiction writers who get turned into their fanfiction PokÃ©mon characters. /spoiler'd
02XD
5It was actually quite a thrill to write. :D
5I stopped in August 2008, but now I'm seriously considering picking it back up again,
5**.
02Reminds me of my first (fail might I add) fanfic
02I won't explain i
02it*
02And my chain broke at 38
02Just like I predicted
06lol
5My first fanfic was an epic fail. D: It has never seen the light of day since. I don't know where it is, haha.
06my first one filed as well
5Here's that fanfic by the way, in case you ever wanna read it: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4234644/1/bSwitched_b_bIdentities_b
06failed
06but the second was finished, I actually like it
06third was even better
06also finished
06I have three finished ones
5I have yet to finish a decent fanfic.
02o3o
02I can't
02read online very well
06"Song of the North Wind", "Darkness in Light", and "Seven Hundred Years"
5Aw meep.
06SHY was a fun one to write
5Print it out? :D
5What were they about Roara?
02I could try
/me remebers SHY
5Aaaaahh. How 'bout that. x3
06SotNW was a pokemon meets real world story, also fun to write
06SHY was a story I did a bit of research for, as I wanted it to be a very believable story of the tale behind the legendary beasts, the two towers of Ecruteak, and the two birds
06and how all that went down
5Awesome. I think I'll definitely check SHY out, and the others.
06with a bit of tie-ins for the rest of the pokemon world
5Are they on your dA? Or whatever?
06it's like 10 chapters, quick reading
06here on TST
5Okay. :D
/me really needs to read it too
/me hugs
5I've (of course) read way too many Mewtwo fics on Fanfiction.net and SO MANY have just made my eyes bleed, they're so terrible. x__x I won't claim to be that great of a writer, but some of them are just /bad/.
14Hey there NS ^_^
06lol
02and heya Drake
/me is away: afk
02sorry
04aww cya
02Sometimes it's fun to just read fanfics out of curiosity
5The worst are the ones that are completely OOC and Mewtwo of course falls in love with the Author's OC and then it all just goes downhill from there. >>; Canon x OC romances rarely have impressed me in general.
02Mmk, can you explain what OOC and Canon mean? XD
5The only Mewtwo x OC pairing that has thoroughly intrigued me is the one from Kayasuri-n's Sword & Shield series...
5@Shiny :: Okay, ah...
5OOC is like "Out of Character". It's when someone takes a character from the series, manga, games, whatever and makes them completely different from how they were intentioned to be. It's like a really bad misinterpretation.
:D
5"Canon" is just an original character from the series, manga, whatever. It's established in the franchise.
02All right, I think I understand
14Sounds great :D
heya
02Oooh all right
5And all the legendaries that have been in movies or the manga have those established, "canon" personalities.
14Also decided to do some cleaning up on DC, so I wrote a short little topic in the admin board, check it whenever you can get the chance to ^_^
02alright
02I need to afk now
5There's more leniance in canon personalities and such in PokÃ©mon than some other franchises (like Star Trek, where if there is one line that feels wrong boy will you have an army after you) but that's because some of the canon writing isn't all that fantastic.. xD;
14Yea I know, but i'm just letting you know so you'll stop by sometime today
02Why does this remind me of Twilight a lot? o3o
5Especially in the dubs.
14Laters (:
5EW TWILIGHT.
5x3;;
02Exactly!
5Twilight is considered by some people "bad fanfic" for a reason.
5I'm surprised Steph Meyer got the series published at all, but the editor probably knew tweenage girls would go gaga over it...
06ok
06the editor
06needs to burn
06I caught a typo/grammer error every other page in that series
5Meyer took advantage of all the girls who'd never seen Buffy, or Angel, or read the original Dracula or even 'Salem's Lot. ;__;
02She had an editor?
5Really Roara? o-o
02bbl now
06RP, heck yes o-o
5Really Roara? o-o
06you never noticed it lol
5Whoa chat fail there.
:)
5Um, Roara, I was trying to NOT DIE while reading the first book.
5I wasn't paying attention to grammar, etc. xD;
06lol
06now
:)
06Percy Jackson, THAT is a good series
5I haven't read Percy Jackson...
06...
06ok
06then your life is not complete
/me runs
5...I'm too wrapped up in Stephen King novels and Star Trek books. o3o
06lol
5I might read it eventually. ^^;
06this story is amazing
02gah
06true to just about every greek myth there is
02It's 2 AM x.x
5Star Trek: DS9 Relaunch = AMAAAZING. <3
06oh hey

The Elder Scrolls needs a fifth sequal already
lopl
I want Portal 2 but I'll probably not get it because of how overpriced games are now :V
I'm pretty sure people will only buy that game if it's bundled like the Orange Box
Or has a price slash
I almost never get games because of lack of monies
06hmm
06I still have two hours
until?
06I leave
06gonna stick about 500 plastic forks into my friend's lawn
06why? because I'm simply awesome
... :V
any other reason?
06because
06it's her birthday
Some games are released at a cheaper price point
06traditional birthday surprises
Like...
06as much as I want the 3DS
06it'll be UBER expensive
what's-it-called
06and then yeah, the games
06probably 50 bucks each as well
/me falls asleep between Twilight and Proto
Aurora, is it true the 3DS will have gamecube quality graphics?
/me is going to do work in like an hour :<
06from what I've been reading, it'll be pretty impressive
06and apparently some companies are going to release movies to for 3DS
it;ll probably be PS3 priced though :V
06like....movies that were in Digital 3D
wat.
06How to Train Your Dragon was one of the titles there
I still like my DVD videos :V
06well yeah DVD
06but if you wanted to see it in 3D again
:P I wanna know why if Nintendo made a tiny DS screen into 3D sans glasses, why don't they start making large 3D TVs that don't need glasses
06kipi
06they do
06they're UBER expensive beasts though
O.o I heard nothing of thatthough
06samsung
06they made one
06http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/tv-video/televisions/led-tv/UN55C7000WFXZA/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail
06now if you have about 3500 to spend, go get it
I meant one from Nintendo though. :O
06....
06for games then?
XP nevermind
06you suck at explaining
Maybe you suck at understanding. D:<
He's saying why doesn't Nintendo expand to other branches of home entertainment
^
and I say because they don't make them themselves, they get other companies (like Samsung) to design them
pretty sure. :V
They probably have agreements with companies like that to not go into other businesses
and in return Nintendo gets to use their technologies
'w'
Hi.
06....tired
/me splashes ice cold coffee in the opposite direction of Aurora's face.
06oh great time to be hungry -_-

06nothng
/me hugs
06but a suspicious person walking around a person's lawn

04k
06but forks stick better
Or foons.
06and I already bought them
Well, next time get knorks.

06no, I was saying not anymore to the fact that it's wednesday
06but I thought bowling night was fridays
06wednesday is buffet sushi night
No, that's Bowling hat day.

Don't worry. The next one is only several years from now.

In the mean time, enjoy Low Fat Mayonaise Day.

Everyone's gone t' sleep in all the channels I'm in
Nah.

Though Lady Roara remains, I'm too needy for attention than one person can provide
Therefore

06on yo face
07on my screen?
07oh... but i can grow one there, it just wouldn't seem original
14[12:12] <%Aurora> and I was here to see it <<<< XD
07besides i have a job interview at like 10
06lol
07stupid life and life responsibilities!
06^yes
14I honestly can't be bothered to work on them yet XD
07i wanna be 12 again...
14Try being 21 lol
07ugh doesn't sound appealing
07no offense
02XD
06I wouldn't mind living 16-17
06those were good years
06probably 17, cuz I actually could drive
06oh look
064:30
07true that. i have a niece that's 5 years younger than me. every time her birthday rolls around it makes me feel even older
06time to go prank somebody :P
14LOL
07lucky! there's nobody cool to prank here....
06I've pulled an all-nighter
06just for this :>
14XD
14Nice
07oh wow
06anyways, better go
07later
06I think she wakes up early this morning
14Sounds like something I'd do but yeah, cya :<
07lol those quit messages are so random
14Eh, I've seen hundreds of different ones
07what's the best one you can remember?
/me shrugs 'Dunno, cant say that I purposely remember em'
07lol
07it's all good
07the pokemon theme here reminds me of awkward zombie haha
14lol
07stupid bugs go away!
07i just smeared one all over my screen......
14Lovely XD
oO Ew
07it's not my fault my monitor is emitting the only bright light in the house... or that the bugs are attracted to said light....
bugs in house?
07moths
07they get in somehow
07small
ah
07what's annoying is when i find a scorpion...
Where do you live?
07arizona
Ah.
So you're in PDT at the moment
07ehh, we're a weird state, we don't do the whole daylight savings thing
We used to not do it
:V
07the area i'm in is pretty well developed neighborhood-wise, it's just got a lot of pests
Except the state just had to have their daylight savins
07ah
I live out in the middle of nowhere :V
07nice. is that fun?
I mean, I live in a small town, but it's really, really small
07lol
:V
07i might understand what you mean. AZ is like that up north in a bunch of places
No. I'd imagine living out in the country would be more fun
07probably
Either in a larger town or the country, just not this. :V
07lol
That's also part of the reason I don't have a job
07there's a little town barely attached to mine called Lehi, and hardly anyone knows it exists lol
07jobs are good to have, i see your point why you do not like it there
There's a town about 10 miles away that I could get a job in.
07well, can you drive?
But I'd doubt there are many jobs left after school got out :V
yes
07that sucks... stupid children and them wanting to take our jobs....
I'm 16 :V
07oh. nevermind then lol
o.o
I'd really like a job so I could make money, but my parents would probably make me pay for gas making it just that much less of a good thing :V
07not saying i'm that far ahead, i just dislike having the adult responsibilities
07lol parents will do that
07i'd have to pay for my own insurance, so i'm waiting for a better paying job to come by before i start working hard on my truck
07here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo doo......
07i don't speak music.....
07well....
07i only read it....
07sort of
07they would put the black pokemon in white and the white pokemon in black....
I heard that :V
07it's kinda silly, if you ask me
07but even though zekrom looks way more awesome that reshiram, i must remain loyal to fire and go with reshiram...
07have you seen the pictures yet?
aw, the chat disappeared when i voted

Games can be quickly made for multiple platforms
you are too high on catnip to notice him
No
WHat I meant was
oh, right
Create one game, and it can be quickly ported to every game system
Oyah
I am
That would be a challenge, as each system would have to run the same OS.

it heats up FAST
within 2 minutes of the fan being off it went up like 5 degrees LO'

20 PCs is hardly a massive heatsource

the 20 people manning them will be far more
yes.
...
there's only 4 people in here
just a bunch of Linux boxes sitting there turned on 24/7
yeah
these are all Dells
which means they suck
which means they produce heat
14This laptop is a dell lol
1200-1500W from the people then, would have to be very inefficient PCs to produce that much

Pokesav IS awesome.

10I don't play competively, so...
+1 to you then

xD
12lol
14xD
03I stay within the rules though. 510 max EV's total
I rarely play Pokemon at all anyway - but I do use Pokesav when I've completed the games and such
14^

07yes
7hi twilight
03NINE MINTUES TO FINISH LUNCH, LOL
07in diamond i used to put them between my magcargo and my camerupt and just bike up and down cycling road until they hatched
7 1 hour to hatch a absol egg FTW
12Twilight: is that a personal record? o3o
03Maybe XD
03Unless you count toast.
07that works too
7and the dads a espeon
07lol
03Because I like to eat toast after breakfast, too XD
07i dun understand. if eevee is supposed to be like a fox, why does espeon look more like a cat?
7im using a ninetales and 2 absol
7i dont know
07it never made sense to me...
7but a dad on my games an espeon
/me HIDES
07lol
7on my game
And Espeon looks like a cat just because, that's why
14Asking why Eevee evolves into Espeon is like asking why Clampearl evolves into Huntail and Gorebyss.
7?
7SA
07lol
7i named a absol after SA
7on my game
7heh
14Are there enough spaces to do that? :/
07or why a feebas turns into a milotic.... i see what ur sayin
7yep
tl;dr logic + pokemon = tilt
07indeed
14Pokemon doesn't have to make sense because it's too epic.
07an alien fox
07...?

07brb
7o.0
14static fur
7and no tail but some how uses irn tail
7*iorn
7?
7whats umbreon
14a fox obviously
14a radiated fox
7that glows in the dark
and is win
14due to radiation
Most of them are probably vulpine/canine except Espeon.
7vaporeon is a mermaid fox thingy
14I don't think Vaporeon looks anything like a fox.
7heh
12wb drf

04I can only do office work so I'm waiting for that.
RN, I'm using my phone
they don't care XD
04I can't work in shops, it drives me insane and I last a day.
04Haha ok
07i'm feeling kinda meh about it. if i knew more about the company i'd prolly be more excited
04Sometimes they ask you about the company in the interview.
07yeah...
04You have to pretend to care and not that you're just after the salary LOL
04well that's me anyways xD
07hey, whatever works huh?

07i love how you can put a damp washcloth in the dryer with a nice shirt to get the wrinkles out...
04I just put clothes in front of the fire as I don't like to iron xD

12about the save file
7yep
7the zorarok event in japan
7heh
7lucky
7WAIT
12it's japan >_>
04I'm very behind with black and white although back in 2000 it was rumoured the black and white versions were going to be where we could play as team rocket members >> they lied xD
what about a zorark event??
LOL
12i've heard rumors that the japanese pokemon people are really not happy with the US
12lol
7ITS A EVOLVING LENGENDARY FTW
wai?
7zororak
04Who IS happy with the US? xD
7me
7NOT
12well
12i heard it's because for starters
04I'm off to watch supernatural, bye all
12we keep hosting pokemon TCG world championships
7we have 20x nukes then EVERY ONE!!!!!!!!
12and then... we keep winning pokemon TCG world championships, every so often some other country will win it but it's usually the US
7..
7well i like ABSOL
7i have a absol ex card
12i heard that XD
7and a regular
12the japanese have a top secret site up
I'm fairly sure Russia has more nuclear bombs than us.
12so secret that you have to be a japanese citizen to even join the site and basically its pokemon labs (the people who invent the cards) post decklists and ideas they came up with
12just so they can try to get an advantage over the US but of course this is all rumors
wat
:V
ovO
wow
But of course this is pretty much just the TCG world :V
12the japanese keep winning the video game showdown XD
12they take their video game tournaments far more seriously than we do
12they have cities and states and blahblah for the video game we just have regionals and nationals
In Asia competitive gaming is serious business
I really don't care about competitive gaming :V
inorite
12just because it's a tournament
gaming, tournaments, and things not video games but still games
12doesn't mean it has to be competitive
starcraft in korea :V
of course not
starcraft is pretty much a professional sport in korea
:V
but it's more popular. I don't mind
lol true

10Umbreon stalks prey silently at night. As it awaits its victims' approach, the yellow rings on its body begin to glow. During the day, they blink on and off. - quoted from Bulbapedia
lawl
you actually trust that site
10Bulbapedia? Yes, it is quite accurate
10You must be thinking of Wikipedia
3>online wiki
3>accurate

Pretty much

E:

12XD
soul*
Of course. Ive got nothing against his money.
7where is it
I just dont like his music.
7your profile?
I don't either
"music"
don't forget the quotes
Thats something a lot of people need to learn
But that's what makes it fun to quote his lyrics -- everyone cringes :P
7silver?
5Welcome back DRF. ^^
03thanks
money is money, its as good as the next guys.
7where is it

7yep
5For now anyways.
ok
6lol rp
Yes
6how does that work xD

But the akward type of 13 year old girls.

7 1 more request
ok
Nope.
Just haters.
/me floofs the Lord of the Seas
14^^
oh wow
/me floofs
But I have a 13 year old sister.
chomp.
lol
5Like.. SAI is really nice but it turns out PSE7 doesn't want me to use Pen Pressure either. I think it has something to do with the fact that this is Window 7 and my tablet is oooooold.
which tablet is it?
5So I'm using SAI. And I like the rotate button. xD It's very nice.
cool
Is she into him?
Nope
6if you really want a tablet, invest in a bamboofun
That's good
Shes homeschooled
^^
she isnt exposed to the fads
6UGH
/me is cute and floofy
lol
Ahh.
she thinks for herself.
6I forgot how long it's been since I've had soda
haha
6that was gross

5@Aurora :: Tell that to the twenty people I sent in job applications to, LOL.
<D_L_M_B> LOL
<D_L_M_B> Well anyhow, I am VERY impressed with the little thing.

6>_>
/me is glad he did homeschool

6RP, that doesnt sound right
6that's way too expensive
5o-o

5Maybe I'm thinking of a different Wacom..

I didnt know that.
7 boy growlihte with red scarf with a sun half yellow and black on the scarf
Ive been homeschooled since grade 9.
or as you say down south
7better?
"9th Grade"
6oh well

6mine was like 100-ish
Same here --
7thanks!
I started about halfway through grade 9, I hated high school
7i just found some thing
what
I got sick of the 2 hour bus ride.
I got sick of the people
It felt like prison
7hit up arrow key
5Hm. Well...
6oh thanks a lot, teacher, using terms that weren't even in the reading
7on key boad
The people were alright...
cool and hit down key ^^
5I get claustrophobic. xD;
6wth
But I got sick of being asked if I wanted to fight.
6this is one of those sentences I can't make sense of
7i know right
6I've re-read it about 20 times
That was everyones response to something they didn't agree with
"yo i will kick ur azz"
I just know how some of these school shooters get motivated to go over the edge
I would have never shot people.
But I can see how some people don't have the self control and go nuts.
Yeah
I hear college is totally different though.
It is
5o-o I just saw a Bamboo Touch on Amazon for thirty bucks LOL. Can't be true though..
7...
:>
6Most students don't realize the extent to which their grades are influenced by accidental happenings. <-if anyone can translate this, help me lol
The cool thing is that most of our student government was homeschooled for a while -- my VP was homeschooled since Grade 3
Plus there are a lot of pervy teachers who are around here
6RP, that's stupidly cheap, but 80-90 isn't uncommon
and I refuse to support their paycheck.
14<:
5Yeah I know. I'm on Amazon at the moment; might check Ebay later.
Thats because we're smarter.
14Quiet channel is quiet D:
Yeah, there's always pervy teachers
actually, im not accidemically smarter.
'm AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
10:/
5Aurora, doesn't it mean something like.. "Tiny mistakes can be detrimental to your grade"?
But im smarter in other areas.
It was in the news a few years ago that a teacher married one of his students in high school
14OH Sneas
Isnt that illegal?
I'm eating lays potato chips and wishing One Over Chaplin would release their [censored] CD
/me pokes
or alibama...
5Like an accident can bring you down a lot, maybe. If you make a mistake, even a tiny one.
I heard you can marry your cousin in alibama, is that true?
it's not illegal in Canada if the student's over 18 >.>
I mean, 18 or over <.<
In Alabama, it's in the consitution that marriages between kin cannot be made illegal
Or is that just a joke.
6k thanks
I see
And that's not a joke, she was like 16 or 17, he just got his masters degree and was in his early 20's
7?
10I gtg get ready for volleyball, bye
14cya :<
6...
D3
5Sure thing.
6that was pointless lmao
5Oh.
Well i guess its not as bad as those marriages between 75 year old men and 9 year olds.
7loll
/me is nomme
*nommed
6so
6I took this survey
14eeep
6and I expected to get like a couple paragraphs as an answer
6I got the number "4"
Actually, I think that's when they started having a relationship -- I think they waited a few years until she gratuated before getting married
Her parents must have had to approve it if she was underaged
6WTF is that supposed to mean
around here you can get married at 17 but you need parental approval.
5xD
7you lose?idk
So, I think she was 18 or 19 when she got married
Unless they changed that in the past 20 years.
7soryy
Yeah thats not really a problem then.
My mom was married when she was 17.
I personally believe that you shouldn't have a intimate relationship in a professional environment like that -- I don't think you can perform professional duties and have an intimate relationship at the same time
/me is still engaged to be married to Curly for Canadian citizenship :3
7 4 times the charm
14Aurora: It's means floof
6this teacher seriously needs to realize her class is set up like crap
6I'm BSing a lot of this
That makes sense.
ohyearora, did you finish downloading that rar?
03what rar o.o
5What class is it?
6oh yeah, like ages ago
6wasn't the right soundtrack
6that was the common one

By valley girls you mean...
yeah
it's easy to put clips on the lyrics for now but I'm trying to limit 1 character per trait and when the instrument parts come again it'll be hard
blond chicks with a braincell each,
who say "like" every 3rd word
BC, Canada is pretty sweet place to live.
I dont think id give it up to move anywhere else.
I want to move to scotland
Especially up country BC, its a beautiful place.

Spyro*
Curly, you ever been to Pemberton area?

I'm here
I'm about to go to Keremeos to visit a friend though

We have a cabin past Pemberton in Gun Lake/Goldbridge/Bralorne area
you heard of that place?
no :X
in other news I just found this total alesana ripoff band but they're pretty good so it's ok
Hey Zen, sorry. Telling this guys several girlfriends that he is cheating on all of them >_>
oh..
Its the best place you'll ever go to.
Lol
I'll keep that in mind :O
I think I'd like to move to BC, maybe to study abroad. or something
lol
can you give me a google map link? I'd like to visit the rest of BC one day when I get a proper driver's license
/me plays "Mindless Self Indulgence - Bite Your Rhythmes"
silver ask to be my buddy please
I LOVE FINDING FREE MP3 DOWNLOADS FOR LITTLE BANDS OMG
idk why
I hate how some of the songs on the Warped album are really good until a screamo part comes in and ruins the song for me
can i be your buddy?
yay for good music
/me isn't a big fan of screamo
gun lake isnt even on google maps.
shure
Its very remote and secret.
/me barks
ok
it makes me feel really musically intelligent I guess even though I'm def not
lol
well, it's there, you just won't be able to search for it ^^;
12.
12XD
Haha
/me moos
like Evans Lake is not easy to find unless you know where it is
14etc
you know how to ask right?
/me doesn't like living in Alabama >.>
no...
and not the Evans Lake in East BC
found it
XD
14Ask?, you mean request
14:P
most "screamo" bands aren't really screamo, I call them screamo anyways though because I'm too lazy to type out "post hardcore"

I love kayaking on lakes
04fff

I need to go horseback riding again someday too
I liked this one a lot
04I can't get over how good the DotD credits theme is

04looooooool
at one point we owned 50% of the city of Bralorne
14Why the hell did I think of the ending credits from Eragon just then LOL
which is about 15 minutes away from gun lake.
04LOL
its under the first box on the left
I live near a town called Felix
I wanna be mayor of it
I have a cat named Felix :O
he's the most adorable cat I've ever owned <3
Why, nothing to do and you get paid
it has a population of 2
and I am Felix
you're my cat? :O
14I meant to say Rebecca Kneubuhl <sp?>
we bought up a lot of the houses there and fixed em up and sold them to people.
Felix is my real name
04lol
I hope the area stays a secret for a bit longer, id hate to have a whole bunch of people go up there.
04yeah I think that's how you spell it
cant find it
/me shrugs XD
xD
04Eragon too
I know, I was just joking Zen ^^;
soz...
04well, the movie makes Eragon look crap as well but anyway
14Eragon meh
14XD
XD
hmm...
there's probably tons of secret places around BC
/me RUNS
04no

Take out the Imean

Still works
/me RUNS

04LOL
Curly, thats what my grandpa is doing at gun lake.
I've been awake for almost 24 hours
/me is searching for it
hi Proto ^^
woah lol
lucky :O
........
hssh198?
Hi
although he might notbe able to retire for some time.
6yeah are you him?
I am going to sleep great tonight
it's kind of weird how just a hundred years ago all of the lower mainland was a forest
bbl
going out with Tobi
:O
no
XD
yay for no work
well, maybe slightly more than a hundred years
why
Its pretty cool actually.
most of BC is untouched.
it is :O
it also makes me feel sad
7okay 1 sec ill ask YOU
it must have been beautiful when it wasn't colonized
ok...
I sort of like it, we can drive to the city when we need to and be bushmen when we want.
that is true ^^
Curly: But no one would've been able to enjoy it when it wasn't colonized D:
Theres a ton of it though that still is beatiful. we have hardly colonized 0.5% of bc.
yes they would, the natives managed it
7whats your user name?
Oh
7real queck
They couldn't get internet though D:
LOL
that's probably true :P
they couldnt talk to people on irc about how awesome it is.
xD
xD
7oh
7ok
yeah...
Oh look
they aren't?
yes he is but he hasn't said a word haha
nope
nope
nope
Hahaha
they haven't been here since the last ice age
7where already buddies
nope
i know
nope
7sweet
/me gets some sugary kool aid to stay awake
lol
i know!
I'm glad it's not too hard to get Canadian citizenship
I'd hate to be a Canadian trying to get US citizenship
yeah haha
we let anyone come on in.
we've been critisized for being too open and not fact checking.
it's hard to get a US citizenship?
Uh...YA
Very hard
I mean for Canadians?
Yeah
Anyone
anyone
I thought Canadians had it easier
weird
Maybe a little
We do racially profile more than we should
we have an easy border crossing at least
it is very hard to get a us citizenshio
unless you marry someone from the usa
7sa?
even then though theres a long waiting period.
Even then, you have to prove that you're in love
Like a Russian mail-order bride
My cousin married someone from seattle.
grlgrdlgdgdr there are great downloads today on lfm for me :D
7so hows the growlite coming along?
7and the ninetales?
OMG! even itunes
gaslight anthem
yessss
You have to essentially prove that you're not a terrorist to a police officer who automatically assumes your associated with a terrorist network
lol
lol
weird
/me was not aware the US was /that/ paranoid
gaslight anthem for free lifes good
how often do you cross the border?
not often >.>
yeah we cross often and they are usually paranoid at the border
Going to mexico they just let you roll
finished
but the odd time you get a guy who doesnt even check your passports.
Coming back you have to be strip searched
I'm really just kinda sick of being here, I'm sick of the way people here think, the way they act, how hot it is all the time, etc etc >.>
And if you're mexican coming back...
/me eyes BC
...
I cant handle the heat of the south.
BC is usually pretty mild in weather
I mean
in the lower mainland
i gotta go bye
It was kinda warm today
heat index of 105
Right now, the temperature is about 30
105 fahrenheit?
I like the fact you guys got lots of good guns down there though.
Very wet in BC.
Yes
kinda warm? >.>
that sounds intolerable :S
rednecks are good for finding guns
30 C , I mean
NAh, it's not that bad
that's like 40C
Not bad in Michigan
!tfw
lol right
I can't even sleep when it hits 30C
76 as of now
Me either
/me has a couple guns that are illegal in Canad ^^
I don't even know any Australians who say that 40C isn't so bad >.>
you know you're home when it rains 70% of the year.
lol
6daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang this is a hard class lmao
/me doesn't like how easy it is to get guns though >.>
The hottest it usually gets here is like 35C
But thats rare and only for a day or two.
>.<
7o.o
the hottest it ever got in Vancouver was 35C I think
that's the record as far as I know
usually it's not so high though
Its super easy to get guns here if you buy from the gangs.
7well bye im going to help make dinner cause i want to
"31C, feels like 33C" >.<
But if you want to go legit, you just need to take a course and background check and stuff to get your license.
then you can own rifles and shotguns.
well
Handguns are restricted and a lot harder to get legally.
rifles and shotguns can be bought without a license if you have the proper justifications
/me has a handgun :3
/me has friends with CWL's
That are 15
Curly, I dont think so.
Ive never heard of anything like that.
I'm pretty sure there's laws about sustenance hunting
/me had Curly held up at point blank range over Skype ^^
Id like you to find it for me.
okay, hang on
Because I dont think thats true.
I might be wrong though
We are extremely strict.
Why would a 15 year old need a concealed weapon?
I mean, it is nice to have those guys around
As friends anyways
and of course nowhere in canada can you ever have a gun on you at any time
except in hunting zones
in season.
and only rifles.
Handguns are only legal at the range.
I'm getting a CWL as soon as I can
That's not too bad
Canada has a lower crime rate than the US anyway, so they're doing something right
But of course that doesn't stop the gangs.
Lower murder rate
Vancouver has a high murder rate.
Vancouver has a lot of gang problems
/me sits all over Aurora
Oh, I was talking about Canada vs USA
I would atrtribute that to Canadaians just being nicer.
:P
haha
I'd imagine,
quite a bit
since arms are really valuable
you can hold stuff, and the like
xD
'-'
6Kyu save me from this class
oh
nevermind
ahem
6I can't believe how insane it it
:x
6it is
I was thinking of something else but even there you need a license
Hell, I know someone that /found/ a Hi-Point polymer 9mm in a bag in the middle of the road
It costs like $444 to get a good, used, semi-automatic pistol
6I'm literally about to cry because I can't make sense of it
Id need to ask someone.
12o.o
are you interested?
my mom's got a pretty nice ruger
because you cant bring your guns with you here.
all I want is a rifle :I
but I'm not a gun person
07o3o
I'd take a revolver over a semi
Unless you fill out paperwork and spend hundreds of dollars.
Curly, why>
curly, like the Remington I showed you?
um, maybe? I don't remember
I take it a bunch of you know eachother irl?
no >.>
We were shooting my Grandpas .357 S&W magnum up country.
The one with the bobcat
for target shooting
Wooooooooo .357
oh, that one
my dad had a .44 magnum
I didn't like that rifle
D:
it looked too tube like
we have a .44
Why not ;-;
Oh
Shooting teaches you a lot of things.
Targets or hunting.
like how to kill people
well, killing people is easy with a gun >.>
you don't even need practice :O
just point and shoot!
point at the nearest person and pull the trigger
just like Grand Theft Auto taught me
I love florida
Ive got some Ninja Stars here that could probably kill pretty easy :)
Ive been practicing
someone breaks in and you think they've got a gun
thank you deale xtreme.
my fav. weapon we have is a crossbow
You can get rid of them
crossbows are badass
seriously
I imagine a star type shuriken is only useful if you get someone in the neck
it's like a gun,
but massive bolts,
and it's silent
If someone forces their way into your home like that it should be fair game.
Until you miss and have to redraw it, Zen
forced entry.
Yep
That's why I don't miss
Theres no excuse for that kind of shit.
and it's a small one,
so it draws fast
crossbows aren't silent >.>
You can't booby trap your homes though in the US
not as loud as a gun though for sure
More silent than a gun.
they're a whole lot quieter than a gun,
even silenced
someone was breaking into my teachers hom
home*
I own a real bow too
that's fun
6it's probably the fact I'm running on no sleep in the past 36 hours
archery rocks
6I'm a little stressed lol
I'm terrible at archery ^^;
He used tricks he learned from bootcamp around Vietnam time >_>
I dont own a crossbow.
07o3o;
07this might help
I probably should get one though.
07O.-.o
/me 6gigglesnorts
6...
6ew
6I sprayed soda on my screen
07O.-.o
I always preferred bows to crossbows
just in terms of aesthetics anyway
I prefer collision weapons
collision weapons?
They're elegant, Curly :D
like,
Bows*
swords,
Bos
etc
oh
non-ballistic
well
bows are ballistic
Aye
but I know what you mean
Not a bow
a bo
The gangs here just get their guns from the USA anyways.
ooooh
okay
melee weapons are nice too
I'm a mean fighter with a bo
I'm alright with a katana, too
Morning star ftw
Or a Zweihander
lol
that's so uncivilized
but would be pretty brutal in a fight I think
and claymores are WAY too heavy to be good for anything
Wha?
I prefer a rapier anyday
Unless you can weild one properly lol
cut them in half >_>
6cleaned it
they're really slow
/me 6gigglesnorts again
have you ever held one?
I read that claymores tended to be used like spears
I know they're slow
curly, they were more like axes
well
thanks
you heft it up and let it fall
hold the blade with one hand
hey
and stab :O
wb!
obviously you'd need hand protection >.>
lol
/me is sooo close to falling asleep
yeah
someone posted info about a video on LPF with a guy getting his eyes stabbed out.
and beaten with a hammer.
Oy
Ah
Yeah
Hey Zen
Dnep. maniacs
I don't think he posted the actual video, Spyro
I'm eating that pasta you left from last weekend
:P
yknow what's fun?
Halberds
I like those small Norse battle axes
:D
Yay!
oh
I forgot about that lol
I'm not one for axe-type weapons
that was 3 guys 1 hammer :O
Me too
that was a gross video
lol
Until just now
I am jaded
that was sorta blahh to me
:O
6YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I read the wiki, and it didn't really bother me
the gurgling got to me >.>
6I finished my assignment
I don't like them
/me doesn't want to know
/me doesn't either
5Yay. :D
/me couldn't stand that horrible gurgling noise
6now I do the next one
Proto, I said info.
I think the seal vid would be worse
Oh
on where to find it.
They did?
anyways I gtg
bbl.
I thought they just mentioned it
XD
lol
that was 30 seconds ago
o.o
oh wow, fast email
/me opens up the project for 900
Did you get the one from Gordon about the summer coding?
7FISHFISHFISHFISHFISH.
7:|
hi Quan
uggggggh how am I going to do this
nope
:O
7I HATE YOU, MURPHY'S LAW.
5Hi Quan~
Why did I get it then>
*?
was it throught the school email?
I dunno
it just showed up on my Google Talk
Oh wait, yes I did
.-.
Gordon's a hypocrite
Hm, look how informally he wrote that
...I was just going to say that
XD
"Hey" ... "Pls respond to" ...
And he signs it "Rob"
XD
and he expects /me/ to email him formally
6lmao qwuan
Right.
6what happened this time
6*quan
lol, wow Gordon
little does he realize the impact this email is having on me
:P
http://consumerist.com/2010/06/if-you-dont-tip-your-cabbie-you-might-get-held-hostage.html
Do you think you're going to do it?
I think I should
7Okay, well, I was finishing my cosplay for AnimeNEXT.
I feel a bit guilty for not wanting to though :P
I don't really want to do any more java <.< but I probably should too
6oh no
6I see this coming a mile away
eh, I'll reply to this email tomorrow

I could take on 22.
/me gets prepared.
do the guiz
Fire extinguisher? Check
911 on speed dial? Check
take a quiz.
If not having money for a game is a bad occasion, try not having money for massive shipping charges. ("Wait... it costs <number that looks like a phone number>, to ship <epic (group of) thing(s)> from Australia to Canada? ... Do you take beer as payment?")
XD
you have to be prepared for anything when making pizza
Ugh shipping costs are a pain too.
\32!
That's right
I'm about to take a test in Calculus >.>
It's more of a silly annoyance than a real complaint though.
I am always prepared now :D
The justin bieber test is must more important.
I have the money, just not electronically. ^^
except if Walmart blows up
But hm
Not when the thing your shipping is roughly the size of a small room.
Ouch.
if it does, not my fault
What DID you ship?
xD
I'm not shipping it, as I can't afford to pay the shipping, so I have to let someone else accquire the rare object.

07maybe you should just move to australia :D
Well... chances are it'll end up in the Computer History Museum. Which is a nice thing. Although owning it privately turns the nerd level from "low level geek" to "King of All Nerddom" :P
Hopefully no terrorists are getting ideas from this

Also, the problem once you own said massive collection of objects, is the power, and air conditioning costs if you try to turn it on. ("Oh wow... I turned it on for five minutes and now my power bill looks more like the national debt." :P )
I wonder if it's common to have fish as a topping for pizza
Hahaha

12D:
2my friend seemingly touches my head every day
2weekday
2O:
12Once it reaches three months, the cheese produces its notorious smell because the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and other rind-washed cheeses is Brevibacterium linens, the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor.

/me pokes the chat
/me explodes
/me ow
/me sits on Shena
FFFFF, has Aurora been on at all lately?
04uh yes
04she has just set a curfew for staying up however
04I don't know what it is exactly though
Hah, that sounds like a good idea. :P durring the summer I literally become nocturnal.
....
Its terrible.
04loooool
04I feel like playing some Spyro DotD
04but then I also feel like drawing
I haven't played that in forever o3o
04and writing my FF
04:\
04kik
04lol*
04fff
04DotD is a cool game
/me has been too obsessed with Assassin's Creed 2/Halo ODST lately
04a pity they rushed it
04it could have been so much better
I liked it.
04but a nice game nonetheless
04hey, I did too
But I agree
04but there were alot of places where they could have built upon it
04overall the game was rather short for one
04and melee combat is a PAIN
The melee combat was alright
Do you have the 360 or Wii version?
04one reason why I hate the level 'The Destroyer' is because you have to focus around melee combat due to those crystals draining your Mana
04I have the PS2 version
04x.x
Oh o_o Didn't know they made it for the PS2
04they did
But I normally like melee combat, so it wasn't a big problem for me
04all the next-gen Spyro games have a PS2 version
04even ANB
04meh
Although the armor that regains your mana is awesome
04I just hate it how annoying it is to avoid
04the dodge move is so hard to control
04not to mention you often fall off a platform when fighting and have to fly back up
Pfft, I never used dodge
04it's more tedious than hard really
If I was getting low on health I would fly away/switch to the other character
And I never played ANB
04neither
04I only have TEN and DotD
Me too
04but I'm sure it was released for the PS2
I didn't know ANB existed until after I had beaten TEN
04lol
04I still haven't beaten TEN
04it's freaking HARD
04I'm up to the white isle
When I started TEN I was like ".....Who the heck is Cynder?"
04looooool
I haven't played that game in forever either, I don't remember all the places .-.
04you really need to play ANB to understand TEN
04lol
I just haven't touched my Wii in weeks
04meh
04I've been playing DotD lately
04along with alot of my other PS2 games I normally neglect
04like R&C3
R&C is amazing
04damn right
04I've beaten #3 like, 14 times in a row?
A crack in time on the PS3 was awesome
04DAMMIT
04I want to play A Crack in Time
07yes
O_o
07technically...
04but I don't have a PS3
04only a PS2
04;_;
I do, but all I use it for is..... watching movies ._.
04lol
07but mexico would more likely keep the illegal hostage or something and demand money for their return
I like A crack in time beacuse Clank actually played a major role.
04yeah
Unless he's a human smuggler
I know he played them in the other games, but this one was really based on Clank
...of people to Mexico
04despite Ratchet saying otherwise, the series mainly focused around Ratchet
04but yeah, ACiT really bought Clank's past into the spotlight
04do you think there will be more R&C games?
Hopefully.
Although they would have to make a new main villain
04I've heard they are going to remaster all the previous R&C's and put them on the PS3
</spoileralertfail>
04Like 1, 2 and 3
If they did that would be awesome
Especially 3
04Mind you it's just a rumour
04I've yet to beat the original R&C and R&C2
I haven't beaten the first one
Its hard
04mmm
04I've beaten Ratchet:Deadlocked
04IMO, that was a bit too easy
Yeah
but it was entertaining
04plus there was no Clank, so that's a bummer
04the battle bots didn't do a good job replacing him
That did kind of disappoint me :/ Clank is awesome
04Clank sort of serves as Ratchet's conscience
04especially in #1 and Deadlocked
Lol, yeah.
Oh god, what other R&C games are there?
04R&C: Size Matters
ToD
04Secret Agent Clank (spinoff)
04Quest for Booty
04but that one is smaller than the previous R&C's so it costs less
04plus it is focused more arounf puzzles
04around*
Ugh, I hated Quest for Booty
lol... "booty"...
'w'
04lol
hurhur
04fail naming
I hated these stupid puzzles you had to do on ToD (I think) where you had to move the controller around to make the ball light up the power switches or something..
04lol
Thankfully they took it out in ACiT
Or else that would have made the game terrible and I wouldn't have been able to beat it ._.
I didn't beat ToD actually beacuse of it
04lol
I'm gonna go to sleep nao

12ah lol
/me wing-fives Arti
12Not even Goldeneye Source fully impressed me although I prefered it to this Wii version
14At least someone agrees with me
technically goldeneye is horribly outdated no matter how good the gameplay is
12It's not too outdated for me
my couson forces me to listen to hardcore
and that I mean
12I still play it all the time against people
it is "outdated" to those who try to sell games
not to the players
12Yes yes
12True
anyway got to go
sorry, failed explaining that xD
12Thats why they wqant to remake it of course
/me is going to withhold judgement on the new Goldeneye until it plays it o3o
otherwise dad will throw me over balcony and well miss the footie game

14HAHAHAHAHA WTF LOL
12You might be right there..
there's a few HPs, but 99% of this company's PCs are Dell o.o
I dunno if it's because of discounts or something
Dell SUCKS for individual consumers
but they might be really good toward businesses XD
reminds me of that Burger King vs Ronald anime style pic
14xD
Buyin' in bulk
at least the serial numbers are all 7 digits
12O:
the HP ones are 10-12
more writing :/
ok why do I hear random spanish commercials in my headphones when I don't have a singly tab open
o.O

99 cents per computer
Purchase date on this one: 9/9/2009
9/9/9 XD
14I'm still loling at that pic XD

10I saved it for later XD
the computer I'm on right now
is a 2003 HP, bought early in 2003, it's been out of warranty since 2006

i am
12Hold on
12I just remember I temporarily set it to members only XD
*I* really don't care, but yeah
12To see if that would work
14LOL Arti
LOL
14Fail
!define otaku
12Still hasn't worked
-!- is a Japanese term used to refer to people with obsessive interests, particularly anime, manga, and video games. A female otaku is occasionally referred to as a fujoshi
12x33
12Ok..?
maybe the page just doesn't like n00bs :)
/me hides
otaku is usually used as an insult
12Ahh
not sure why, I didn't come up with it LOL
10oh, I just found a win pic
Uh, there's people who "take pride" in being an Otaku as well o.O
I know
12Well the fact that any non Japanese person is calling someone a Japanese word as an insult says a lot about the person :
It's like the more mature version of a animetard
the definition is incomplete. It also means those people spend excessive amounts of time, effort and money for the thing they're obsessed about
there's also people who take pride in being a furry and I consider that an insult
/me hidse
14LOLWUT
*hides
someone who actually (usually at least) cares about Japan, not only animu
12WEIRD

/me is done with random pic browsing
14drf: most SUV's don't have a good RPM :P

but nope
it's slightly worse LOL

or at least act 13
oh so i have to stay of the chat for 3 years so not fair
people who are obviously younger *cough* should just be banned
3 years, forever, you know/... whatever
/me hides
6maybe it WAS 13

what'd you do?
reboot?
6uninstalled photoshop elements >_>
EW PHOTOSHOP
6hate that program
and wtf elements
that's like the not real version
of it
6I know
6but it's way more annoying
that's why I just pirate the real one
but EW ADOBE regardless
6whenever I start my computer, it boots up claiming I have a cmera plugged in
LOL
6and it takes likea full minute to import these "photos"
that's just a quick msconfig edit
o.o
6and I can't exit the program until it imports these "photos"

6dang I've got awesome hearing
6I just hear my phone vibrate from across the house

roara - this here is a repost for you

that made me actually laugh
6loool

LOL
6stupid flash player
EW ADOBE
6I JUST updated it last night
6I watched a couple movies on youtube
6and then it said my player isn't up to date this morning
that's not your flash player, that's YouTube. YT is made of fail in fact
no, that's Adobe being retarded :D
as YT works fine here and this computer is 7 years old
I use a script in Opera blocking this YouTube Versioncheck to solve it
http://cheezprobablybadnews.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/129197359162853220.jpg
this here solves the problem on Opera - being pasted into a .js file :)
window.opera.addEventListener(
'BeforeScript',
function (ev){
ev.element.text = ev.element.text.replace("yt.flash.update(swfConfig, forceUpdate);","");
},
false);
simply deleting this stupid crap
100% efficiency :)
wait, wait, lemme get this straight
the one who's tryign to tell me that I'm gonna have my computer blow up in my face if I don't keep every piece of software on my computer current is using a script to avoid having to update something? :O

is it bad that I can't read my own writing?
I especially hate Z's and 2's, 5's and S's
6lol
Like with these Dell serial numbers
I keep mixing them up
reading Z's as 2's or vice versa
6my problems are h's and n's, and apparently my 4's and 9's tend to look alike
well
they're in all caps
H and N look totally different
6inlowercase
6I sometimes rush my h's so they have a shorter....line
right, but I'm writing in caps
6dunno what to call that
as the serial numbers are all caps and numbers
6ah

I've never run into that problem
I have 10.1 beta
I know there's a 10.1 final, but eh
wanna have a recommendation badge then?
what?
and hm
guess you're tha walking example for the Homer Simpson-Syndrome :P
Dell certainly likes "ZK1" and "SK1"
a ton of these serial numbers end in one of those
then again this company bought like 300 comptuers at the same time so the serials could all be similar LOL

12i wonder what this computers serial is

I've become quite good at looking up warranty info on them o.o
12i forgot how to check XD
...
look for the sticker
on the computer
LOL
12i could of sworn there was a way to check from within the computer system lol
go into BIOS maybe
I know mine is in BIOS
:V
also, my computers have no serials
my desktop and laptop
both are custom builds
therefore no serial
only the motherboard would have one I suppose
I should put stickers "DRF001" "DRF002" on my two custom PCs XD

02Oh
02Hello .-.
are you using bold? o.o
02I am, yes
why?
/me shrugs
I never noticed before, because my mIRC removes bold
6that's nothing new lmao
but it's fairly annoying
6oh
I never noticed before, because my mIRC removes bold <--
I set it to XD
02Well...
well
it'll show bold for like one word
but nto for entire lines
*not
as that's kinda obnoxious
02Lol wow XD
if I typed entirely in underlines I'd be banned
/me hides
bold is kinda the same thing :/
6normally bold is annoying, but I'm used to Shiny using it
I'm not
LOL
I never use Mibbit
except here at work
6obvisouly
6...
6obviously
6drgkuhdrfk
02Ah...well, I'll try to take it off then
6yaaaaaaay'
well if I'm the only one complaining
6FINALLY finished it
then whatever
I just never realized you were using bold LOL
6drf, you're always complaining lol
not about people
6but yeah, I used to complain about it
just about stupid people
and things said stupid people do
6but it stopped being annoying after a while
02drf sounds like an old guy
LOL
compared to you all I AM old .-.
14Hiya Arti
12hi
12Hi um
6A-R-T-I-BURD
6you should check my forum avatar
12Ok!
6....wut
03Is the quiz only for the forums?
HI Arti
no.
7 o3o
12Weird, chat's not working for them
because she refused to listen to us
12Ohh....
6drf would be happy if he was
/me 6runs
12....What happened?
12Logs?
/me 7reveals her lurkiness
6wait what
12She you mean lol
LOL I would be
6I didn't hear this
um
14Arti did you get my text XD
I obviosuly don't have logs at work
but basically it was just more of the roleplaying and stuff
12o-O
12Yes Roara
6-_-
14Arti the text was about the game LOL
despite me and a couple other mods telling her to stop 28 times
12Didn't you just kick her??
the frist time, yes
*first
then I banned her after she left :)
/me runs
12everything you said pretty much went in one ear and out the other
yep
02FFFF LOL ROARA
that's the problem with little kids
12Wow nice avtar
12*Avatar
they don't know how to listen
12brb
/me remembers finding that a long time ago
12Also if you haven't already seen..
12http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,5635
which is why i still think we should make an age limit
12Yeh I agree
14[21:16] <@Sneas> watch out for those Africans. they're good kickers <<< LOL!
12So I'll set one, 13 minimum
6Arti, agree with what
6oh
Awesome
6thank you -_-
14I agree with that too @Arti
10O:
I'd say we could make exceptions for people who act older
12Yes
12Definitely
6PS is pretty chill
12It's only if we catch n00bs, then we can use age as an excuse to kick them off
XD
7But wouldn't that mean no new young people could join? O_o
12No
12Like I said
12If we catch them because they're n00bs, we kick them out because of their age
we should just say if you're younger than 13, you can use it if and only if you act older than your age
:P
6I thought she admitted to being 13
Aurora... she's 9
6......
no
6HOW THE HECK DID SHE EVEN GET ONLINE LMAO
then again I don't really believe anything she says anyway
THAT'S MY POINT
12Me neither
7o3o
she kept coming in here and writing #RP
6that's younger than my brother X___x
then double clicking it
XD
12Wouldn't surprise me
I was like, learn how to use IRC
but whatever
7Hey, I did that when I was new to IRC. :|
6drf, she didn't understand the /me command
I might remove that ban in a couple days but eh
6let along the /join
you don't need /me to join a channel o.o
6alone
6sukhfd
you just put #RP in the channel box
instead of SW
o.o
assuming you're using mibbit
03Do you only need to answer the quiz for the forums on GPX?
02Roara, where'd you get your avatar? XD
6yeah
7I use /join #channelname now. o3o
12Np
12*o
12xD
6but it took me forever to learn that you can join multiple channels at once on mibbit
LOL
7Commas.
I've always used that
6shiny, "Rescuers: Down Under"
then again I've never used Mibbit primarily
only when I need to
like at work they block port 6667 so I kinda have to
02Well I knew that but
use 6669
/me remembers having that avatar a long time ago and all
um
except 80
I could try but whatever
02I actually still use it on my GPX+ account
mIRC on a work computer... still a little sketchy XD
I was using the TST portable one
02The quiz is only for the forums if you wanna join there
o.o
in normal operation more than just 80 is used by a computer
6you used this avatar? o-o'
well
12Oh
12O:
my high school blocked all but 80 and 8080
and whatever FTP uses
02Yeah lol, I even showed it to you a long time ago
21?
and 22
that was all they allowed
6I'm actually [retty sure I used it once too
6pretty
6sdisdhf
12Well
12It isn't letting me do anything unless I take a stupid quiz on GPX.
02Ah, they might've changed it
02I joined up over a year ago lol so you never know what they changed
6arti you should see this massive mess of papers on my desk
12Y'all see the topic..?
6yes I did
12^^
14I did
12Isn;t that impressive?
6but all these papers are littered with fox drawings
7o3o
12Oh really..?
6I recently found it SO MUCH FUN drawing foxes
draw a fox in a box under some rox </Dr Seuss>
/me hides
6now that I can actually draw the differences between foxes and canines

I didn't clock out until 5:08 today
and she has 7 evil ex boyfriends that he has to defeat
Thats the one!
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Releases august 13th.. Really looking forward to it. Want links?
it looks quite epic
XD
Haha, wow
I kept trying to clean everything up and some girls came by and wanted root beer floats
02wb
ah
Well, its slogan is "An epic of epic epicness."
RO-ro-ro-roara
O_o
Yeah, and as long as you're on the clock you can't really refuse
http://www.mestechmarketing.com/images/funny/DICE-Development.jpg
epicness is nice
:P
Oh yeah
:P
hehe, yup
ra
http://www.mestechmarketing.com/images/funny/DICE-Development.jpg
I kept wondering why this tab kept lighting up
I was scrolled way up like 2 days ago
I once clocked in 8 hours late
:P
but never clocked out that late
That happened to me earlier
IRC does that a lot =/
the latest I've ever clocked out was 2 minutes
It looked like nothing had happened since I went to work this morning
8 hours late?
nuh uh
when it does that to me the scroll bar lights up
how'd you manage that?
14lolwut
errr
I mean minutes
XD
Haha
that makes a lot more sense :P
you won't get it if you haven't played those games :(
Nice, what client do you use?
I should clock in and out 8 hours late some day
just do day shift for the hell of it
14I've only played the MoH
14xD
IceChat
So I'm guessing you know that my phone died this afternoon?
And I didn't just hang up on you?
:P
If you're scrolled up and someone speaks it turns orange
Of course
:P
Handy o;
Yeah
I didn't notice that at first though xD
Actually no, I was very annoyed at you for hanging up on me in the middle of saying something
/me uses icechat too
:P
You just think its was being punky? :p
jk
lol, wrong channel
Oops, wrong channel
lol
/me yawns
o3o
Getting all up like "YO COLOURS XD"
XD
like the girl on Scott Pilgrim's hair
:P
I knew that would happen to me eventually
well, the girl's hair
Scott Pilgrim has a girl on his hair? o.O
not a girl who's on his hair

6quan
6learn the difference between "need" and "want"
Ä±qouoÉ¯
6because I know many people who NEED it, but would really rather not have it
nope
No? I see it =/
or at least not in IceChat
7Okay.

IceChat doesn't always work with that sort of stuff

.... ok, that messed up.
I'm at my friends' house~
that's the same way foreign characters look on IceChat
What is IceChat ?
12lolz
I hear a lot of bad stick
an IRC client
An IRC client
I got that much :p I mean, browser based or what?
04'Quan, his design has changed now, so you might want to check up on it. But if you've got a plausible picture of him then yes, you can enter it.'
not browser based
it's downloadable
04'Quan, his design has changed now, so you might want to check up on it.'
?
04that
bah
but I don't really know any of the other specs
lol
12lms :o
12hiya~
or do I have the definition of "browser based" wrong>
04hiya
hi??
*?
:P
7I assumed the second part was an alright okay. o3o
I don't see how you could
If you download it, its not browser based..
I just guessed because of Nyte's reaction
"bah"
Icechat has nothing to do with a browser, so it's not browser based
i'm still looking for the log
ah
/me facepalms
i have it somewhere i just gotta find it...when i copied and pasted it from the log it worked
Say something, new person!

God I leave for 15 mins and this place exploded
haha
Sorry, I just wont let the conversation die =']
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM
I think that kids is a serious badass
Haha, yeah
Throwing a puppy at bikers is badass enough
but using a bulldozer to escape?
Now that's intense
"Both the student and the dog are now in safe hands, being cared for at a psychiatric clinic and a local animal shelter respectively"
That was mentioned in here yesterday too
or was it necrolounge or UESP
No idea
I think thats just.. immense idea tho. Don't throw hard things at hard men! Throw cute and cuddley as an insult
THEN proceeding the insults, escape in a way more manly then them
Exactly
Hahaha
This man. Is a genius.
He needs to get into standup comedy or something
Or warfare
Mayeb a mix of both =/
At the same time to

"there was a problem joining the match"
o.o
All I see are foreign symbols
crap..i see it on my end
is this chan stripped of codes n stuff?
It's Icechat's fault
It doesn't render a lot of characters correctly
I see it
join #nytetest
i'll try it there without any chan modes
14Anyone know how to register a channel? >.<
It probably works fine
Icechat is just dumb
Yeah, IceChat does that with foreign characters too
14now night all ^^
02night night
12and night
the other one i got was this â™¥â”Œâˆ©â”(â—£_â—¢)â”Œâˆ©â”â™¥
Hey
ah well...i'm using mirc...i know it's silly ...was just something someone put in a chan on another network and i thought it was funny...lol
yeah it died
it died right when I got the spectator thing working
:(
It named me "LameGuest"
lol
What is with all the symbols
What was it supposed to be
sorry
what it looks like in Icechat: http://tinypic.com/r/wrif5i/6
lemme get a screenshot of mine so i can show ya what it looks like
Ya, thats what I got
on mIRC
Your IceChat looks cool actually
I messed around with the colors a lot
It doesn't look like that by default
I know
I like it though
I have all of them "main" Clients
except for the little glitches like the character rendering
09omg everyone is leaving and joining
\Good game

Oblivion has to be the best. Was just making sure others agree :p
lol
Morrowind had more
who else wants to battle me at pool >D
Morrowind was also incomplete, imo
How
14lol, I've been roleplaying with my friend for about two days now.
arg
my IceChat just did somehting wierd
14I've copied down everything so I can put it on Quizilla
14We've managed about 20 pages
a bunch of random boxes faded in and out
2@Twilight: thats a long time....kinda
I also detect clones, netsplits
Did it screw up your spelling?
The battle system mixed with the 3D areas did not work so well.. I think they needed to smooth out the balancing a lot further
:P
Haha
No, that was all my fault
:P
D;
I have a southpark soundbit play when I kick someone
*something weird
14And we're roleplaying through texting XD
2XD
But for its time,
"Kick the Baby"
lol
Its awesome and you dont expect it
And it has a kick counter
I dunno.. They use that excuse but still have balancing issues with Oblivion too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM
Havok is fun with doors
dari if your here you should play pool with me because everyone else that hasn't played pool with me is lazy and mean
Close a door on a dead body
/me BAWWWWWWWs
Oh and um I have that stretchy thing going on in Summitmist
:o
2http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIoSTbPt_PI&feature=channel< this is a video that a random guy made. he did it all by himself, and yesh, all the people are him. (movie magic)
So I touch something all stretched it snaps and flies everywhere
/me 6explodes
Thats what happens after 600 hours on one file
But I need to go. :(
aww
6I've really lost my touch for drawing
/me revives Aurora
NO YOU DON'T :D
dari, don't leave us
/me chains dari to the pool table
2hehe, thats too bad
:D
:(
14D:
Lol, how long would it take?
ummm idk 5 mins
Ok.
depending on if you suck or not
14Any reason why...?
6because I've been stupid and not drawing recently
6I draw pokemon too much
lol
2not really your fault.
6..
:P
6yeah, it kinda is
:P
lol
Mwahahaha!
2not if you've been busy and cant help not being able to draw.
karp karp karp *splash*
>D
6...
You beat it over the head with a stick. D:
6I HAVENT been busy
DINNERTIME :P
more like lighting
6I love how people automatically assume that
but close enough
;)
2okay! just trying to brighten your mood!
Wait... what?
6thanks but yeah
6it's funny how people alwasy seem to think how my life goes lol
Aurora, try drawing more Okami-related art. =3
6I need to draw more realism
6because I've COMPLETELY lost my sense for anatomy
6which was usually my strong point
Its hard to
Like 2 shirts end up stretched WAY out actoss a room
02I think realism will help a lot. =3
so you use "grab" and they snap to normal size and fly around
6...
6realism might be too strong of a term
6stylized realism
/me munches on chocolate-covered bread sticks
Oooh, that happened to a dear.
I still headshotted it through the fog.. but eh. It looked cool
I have done that too!
2@IcyNinetails: um, yuck.
The deer are built badly
2tales*
Too many joints
So it overloads every once in a while
this is intense
No way.
wooooo
Did you mean to do that? XD
/me watches Family Guy
Yeah.. Fun stuff tho. and because its moving REALLY fast when it springs back to normal, aiming them at other creatures is great fun

Rebound the black off one side, and have to it come round to the corner hole?
no

03I'm so happy that that's all it affected. Could have ruined my mother board.

/me is only slightly delicious
I would do that
then i'd get sued and put in juvenille
You could fly away on it
I could couldn't I?
but that's still not right to do
Unless it didn't like giving rides
making people suffer for other's needs
to bad that's what I seem to do a lot of times when it comes to school
The teachers make the students suffer
and the students make the teachers suffer
no one likes kids now in days
But the teachers bugged first!
how long ago was that?
mesoptamia era? *shot*
why is it that whenever you want something its never there
/me sits on May's head and covers her eyes.
i dunno :(
for some reason. this feeling nags at me that no one watches me da account anymore
/me feels the same way
Wibbles.
o.o
Or when you want something, get it, and it's not as good as you think it is
mmmhmm
anyways |3;
¦3
I probably shouldn't have a DA

farsi
I was talking about something else
farsi is a language and you said i wish i could replay in FA

I wish there was something to reply to on FA
I was talking about a website

hi
12Hey :>
hi arti
how are you
12I'm ok thanks, and you?
fine
what do you want to talk about
12 Hello, Things and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
who is cube
12Just a bot
oh
why isnt he/she ever on the chat
12It's a bot!
...
Or not
lol
12I can make it talk look
Sfahsdkghdf
*freaked out*
I AM NOT REAL.
you control cube?!
12I can yeh
how
12By typing commands
what commands
12IRC chat can be very complex at times, it's not just a box to chat in
12Commands that you cannot use
oh...
people told me cube is our master
04I would have been back earlier but I drove through a tear in time and space on the way back and so I'm only just back now :P
04Heya.
...
12EEEE
12RN!!!! ^v^
04By gum?
AHHHHH!
lol
12They were just joking
04LOL
12Cube is often refered to as the master and stuff for a joke
04Was someone with a god complex in or something?
its weird you control cube
04I liked it when Kyu drew Cube as cube with a body and wearing a suit and tie.
lol
12Cube is just a bit of code that controls certain permissions on the chat, like it will assign the ownership status to me when I logon to chat
12Thats the most basic way I can put it
12^v^ RN got tickets yet..?
04I like to think that Cube literally kicks people like in that pic Kyu drew xD
04Tickets for what?
oh and it kicks people out aswell
12Oh sorry yeh you're driving XD
12I keep forgetting LOL
04I always buy my tickets on the day anyway lol
04Usually is the same price xD
12Wow really..? That's way more expensive that way
04Nah I've often found it's the same.
12Not if you buy advance single tickets
04Depends where you're going of course.
12Those are considerably less
04Yeah but I don't have the money in advance to buy them LOLOLOL
12Oh lol XD
04I always wait til I get paid and buy them then LOLOLOL
12Oh well ^^
04still need a job - I don't like working in shops but was considering it til I can find office work
12LUGIA IS GOING TO BE HERE NEXT WEEK :D
/me gets the master ball ready
/me runs
COOL!
12He's flying over on Wednesday
12then taking a bus up to Leeds from London D:
12I can't see him till either Thursday night or Friday though
04Maybe he can give some of the England fans a lift back LMAO
12LOL!!
04Imagine that - and aww ok
lol
12Where the hell is he infact, I need to tell him important things, brb Im gonna text him >v<
04Holland and Japan are playing - 2 of my fave countries, but Holland a bit more xD
04I'm glad about the new film coming up where it's set in an area like the Netherlands. I love it there.
04Wish I could go and spot the Pokemon artists drawing stuff there.
04A pokeball doesn't work on anthros xD
oh...
12back
04LOL the Dutch just did a mexican wave and then when it was the Japanese people's turn they just were like -_- and I've only got the football on because Burnett's sister is watching it.
lol
12RN I want Netherlands to win if not England simply because I got them at the sweepstakes at work XD
12If they win I get half a day off work ^v^
04Cool! ^_^
cool
/me eats digieggs and pokemon eggs
04It's the circle of life :P
lol
04Imagine the fried egg you could make from a Lugia egg
/me runs
if england dont win this match its bye-bye for england
/me gulps as she's about to get smacked from someone "It'd be a huge fried egg"
lol
12D:<
sorry
04You know I'm kidding! Do I look like someone who would do that? (innocent face)
12I wonder just how big a Lugia egg is though.....
12LOL RN
massive
04It would probably be the size of a car or bike or something.
hafe the size of a normal lugia
cos it is
04I don't accept that Wailords lay eggs....nor any other mammal pokemon.
12LOOL!"
04But I suppose it's to stop from disturbing young kids who have never seen a car have kittens or something.
come on
04cat*
12LOL car
LOL
I have a theory for that
Mammalian Pokémon lay eggs only if they are forced to breed
In the wild they give birth to live young
That's what I think.
04Yeah maybe.
04Which means the daycare must be cruel LOL
lol
04I always wonder if a Ninetales' tails are like slowpoke tails, where if they lose them, they grow back.
12Don't think so
04Well it would be nice if so, you could make scarves out of them. Only if it didn't hurt the Ninetales, and they just detached like a lizard's.
Scraves <3
04They'd be nice and floofy scarves.
scarves are awesome
04Perhaps the fur can be harvested like a sheep and the fur will grow back.
04Also, random but there is not yet a llama pokemon >>
i gotta go your talking about some gross stuff
04lol sorry I didn't think it was gross xD
yuck
04I won't talk about it
ok
Did someone say llama?
il stay on chat
04Sorry, stuff like that is normal for me, I forget other people don't like it XD XD
http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/llama
04lol
12Dunno what's so yuck about making something out of Pokemon fur >>
...
12Unless it's killed but we all know RN wouldn't say that!
04Nah not Ninetales.
thats it
12XD
i am going
A scarf made from an Articuno's tail feathers. <3
04Let's talk about rainbows and butterflies xD

12That's fine as long as they grow back XD which they would XD

12YAY
Arti, that Bartz guy just PM'ed me

12But if you're sensible we'll let you stay :3
Ok then,
/me has been here for two years o3o
12It's just n00b protection, although it's also against the law for anyone under 13 to join a forum but I don't care about that
I've been here for almost five now
O_o arti

14Someone hid my DS in my parents room after I got all those PC Wallpapers. <--- I swear, I think my sister had something to do with it, the way she found it so fast >:(
because constantly talking about pokemon is -boring-?
2whos wanting pokemon black/white? im gana get white so i can get Reshiram,

2i want to keep my Lv.100 dialga with me

12 Hello, Things and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

14Zekro

12because white background would not go good with white pokemon
12and black background wouldn't go good with black pokemon lol
I don't like any of them
They scare me as terrible digimon refrences
/me wants a Mijimaru <3
They do and I don't know why and I don't want anyone to kill me for that
12May

It reminded me of Lugia for some reason
12What kind of bird?
Some kind of tropic bird
2ok
I can remember but it did have black Lugia-like eye markings
LOOOOL
Slim tail feathers, and slim wings
I just read the manual of my model plane
General Information: "Do not leave the batteries/recharable batteries lying around openly; there is a risk of them being swallowed by children or pets.
2http://uploads.mibbit.com/xIRID6.png
http://www.avianweb.com/images/birds/TropicBirds/RedbilledTropicbird.jpg

did you maybe swallow my battery?
12o-O

http://www.surfbirds.com/mb/media/rb-tropicbird-cb-1105.jpg

/me flies on an Articuno
Thought it would be odd to see an Arti surfing on a Lugia
Connection overload
http://miburl.com/5aNXk3 <-- That one looks silvery
2lugia can surf and it is possable that a articuno can be on the lugias back
Its good we don't have a bot in here,
Why the hell
03that looks Photoshopped
Still looks cool
I have 6.6s lag
LAAAAGGGGGGGGG

12and has a powerbutton on the inside of the system
14Oops
12not on the side like the lite

12fine
12drf

14And, it can only use SafeGuard noW XD
07that doesn't matter whether or not you use it o3o
07safeguard means you can't put a status on ho-oh which makes it harder to catch
07and once it runs out of that, then he's gonna faint on you when he starts to struggle o3o;
14Thats why I saved in front of him XD

I agree in spite of you!
wait......
03what's fun to do is smash iPhones with other iPhones, double the desctruction :D
03-c
Please attach an arguement to your disagreement
iPhones hate me
03of course, because they suck'
One time, I turned it on and then it froze up
Yeah, that's totally the first time electronics fail.
I don't really care for phones like that, but they're cool for interweb powers
lol
/me eats an appple
in Norway I could say enjoy your bill but heh
what's an "appple"?
An appple is an appple
an apple with magic powers
i'm guessing that's what the extra P stands for?
powers? o3o
03<May> I don't really care for phones like that, but they're cool for interweb powers <-- WTF
03go get a Droid

!define miser

:<
i smell the smellie smell of somthing... smellie....
So... I have to not buy anything?
old sb is better
Yes
That's exactly right
old IS usually better, if you don't look at computers (and in all other cases unless you spazz over lens flare and cel-shade visuals)
now its just ga- dumb
If you don't want to be depressed, than don't buy a thing, you can mooch of your parents or you siblings
*off
12how is mr. kipi
I know someone who is smaller than his little brother.
owO
And no, they're not twins so I'm not speaking a few minutes difference.
Weird
But the last month he have been growing like crazy. So yes, it IS weird.
/me rolls (Kyu)
Maybe one of the parents is short and the other tall?
/me sticks Greg in a box full of catnip
Well his whole family is average sized, so appearently he just gets most of the growth late in his growing phase xD
Luna is smaller than her sister, who's younger by around 5 years
/me heart is like about to explode with happyness
/me is in heaven?
That's really weird
Unless it happen to his dad or mom
Hey, people grow/enter puberty at quite different ages.
Yeah
<X3
exited!
you want some help with that? I mean, "almost" means you're not trying hard enough
well, thanks for the box of fun then
07you're welcome
07=P
errrrrrrrr i want it to be july!!!
then get a time machine. Oh wait...
guess I have to re-install everything
we all live in a slow time machine!
and oh? D:
If it were July, I'd have to change my name
Again
lolwut
if this is remotely obsession based then my care cup is empty
/me rolls
my mom is so paranoid now
"when your done with one game un-install it!"
paranoid of what? o.o
my mom used to blame every computer problem on what I did on the computer
it well, grinded my gears
since SHE fried our old computer :U
Espeon: thats what she does to me now
I know what you mean
Is ecnet down?
wouldnt get on desktop
so we took it to the 'geek squad'
They blamed me for the blue screen virus back in October cause Windows was updating
waitied countless days
*waited
I wasn't even on anything
and then I just have to re-get everything
from pirating games to music

saw the plot on wikipedia
03yeah
Espeon: it didnr escape cameos
but they seem to be funny ones
03yeah, parts were funny
03parts were sad
like Sid returning as a garbage man
03I cried at the end
well cameos can always be funny. CAN.
03^ that was one thing I didn't notice
why?
03which is why I want to find it
03well, Toy STory kinda defined my childhood
03it was sad to see the ending
03not saying more, don't wanna spoilt it

10I cried at the part when they were holding hands lol
03XD
Skylands: well I cried at come and see XD

10I can't believe they were so accepting of death o.o
Hey, ever heard of spoilers?
well what would you do if you were a toy about to die?
03yeah seriously
03that's why I was't gonna say more
I mean I'm sure everyone here doesn't care like me, but really.

03I need to re-watch the first two movies
I should just spoil karate kid
03(when they were re-released in 3D like 6 months ago)
03um
10It's like: Did you know that the toy can actually TALK in the movie?!
maybe THAT'S something I can do before I actually see the third one
for its kinda worth the movie yet kinda not
03Karate kid: the kid beats the bullies
/me shot

10Spoiler alert O:

/me dies
Good actors doesn't make good movies
03Brother, yes
10Good actors =/= good voice actors
but the only good movie about dogs is
03learn to use !=
lol
marely and me, which I tried not to cry at the end
12I HAAAAATE THAT FILM
12IT'S THE STUPIDEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN LOL
03Yeah
03it is
12I'M SO GLAD I ONLY DOWNLOADED IT XD
10D:
03I've never seen it and it's stupdi
03*stupid
12LOL
Meh
12DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
but thats everything to you drf
12I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS
/me dies
03I like Good Boy, that was alright
I remember watching some movie about a hobo and a dog swapping bodies when I were younger.
Marley and Me was mostly about him and the wife
Arti: life happens
Never really about the dog
thats bascially it XD
03heh
03well
10I liked the story concept of Marley and Me, but the movie was too long for what it was
12Yes May, exactly
03movies like The Lion King are one thing, as that's mainly allegory anyway
03the whole thing could be done with humans XD
12Its about a guy, his girlfriend who he marries and then they have kids and then he loses his job so they move house and then their pet dog dies
12AND THATS IT
allegory how? XD
Lion King <3
10animated films FTW
old disney=meh
12It's not even about the dog it's about some guy and his life!
new disney= death
03Brother, allegory
03as in
03it's about the brother of a king trying to steal power
03etc
03it's kindasorta like... Hamlet
03just less incest
only
lolwut
well that
10Shakespeare reference lolwhut
and it cant beat the movie hamlet hands down
/me dies
the one with the newer one
but I always thought it was
12I can't express enough how stupid Marley and Me is XD
12It should be called
like a disney movie for kids but less depressing the bambi
lol
12"The life of a random man"
03XD
/me runs
seriously, how can bambi make me cry I tell you?
03my sisters wanted to see that movie -_-
because
03same with um
03what's that other one like it
03oh
03Hotel for Dogs
12OMG
12LOOOL
03are so stupid
EW HOTEL FOR DOGS
12I wont waste my time with that
that sounds
12LOL Brother
03yeah don't
03XD
horrible
I dont want to waste my brain power
03then again
12But DRF, Marley and Me isn't a kids movie
10Hotel For Dogs was terrible
03my sisters like Hannah Montana -_-
03it's not?
12It's a.. movie for middle aged women
03it's rated PG
that IS horrible
I'd rather waste it on staring on a water bottle
03it's a "family" movie
Arti: No
12Not really, women watch it and think it's awesome
thats "its complicated"
12It's too boring for a family movie
/me dies
03XD
12Lol.
that movie was semi-hilarious
12It isn't funny, it is just literally the life of a random man
03Brother, I don't hate Hollywood as much as you do
03I really don't
03I'm a movie buff
12It's not a comedy, not action or entertainment.,.
03but I like action movies and sci-fi, involving PEOPLE
well they killed my child hood D:
12It's just.. how can I compare it to anything else? ovO
03not "Oh look, a dog that talks and then it dies"
12Wahts the worst movie you've ever seen?
03that sort of movie makes me want to shoot the studio for even releasing it
03me?
12yeh
...Twilight
12Also Marley doesn't even talk, it's just a dog.
03HAH
LOL
Is the worse
that might be a trick question
By far
03I haven't even seen it
03but like
12It does nothig the whole movie except cause the man problems
03was a movie called The New World
03it's like, a live action story about Pocahontas
03only it's like 3 hours long
12LOL
o.O
03and it's fricking boring
03I thought it would be fairly interesting
03it's not
03at all
03the animated one is better :P
12Well I wouldn't say Marley and Me might be that bad but still..
heck no XD
Like all Disney
12I can't think of anytjing I can compare it to..
12Except maybe some stupid love story
12Like um..
the animated would be better if only because of the music
and the senseless drama
12No i really can't think of anything
03Romeo and Juliet?
/me runs
but, what did you watch? XD
03but yeah, EW ROMANTIC MOVIES
03all my favorites are sci-fi/action
12It's worse than romantic
a history channel one?
12It's a movie of a couple who SETTLE DOWN
That Romeo and Juliet is bad, yet good at the same time
03Brother, nah
12Whats so interesting about that?! XD
03it's just fricking *bad*
03same with movies like March of the Penguins
I've never heard of it XD
03that would be fine as a TV documentary on say PBS
03but wtf?
I've heard of that
but I always thought
"why penguins?"
we've already got a BAD movie about them
Cause why not penguins?
*cough*thepenguinandthepebble*cough*
03what's even more EW is Happy Feet
I want to watch a movie about ants, for two hours straight
because don bluth killed penguins
Like a documentary
03it's just... shoot me now, please
03LOL
03well
like how he killed new york
03Just put them on Discvovery Channel
03that's fine
Yeah
03-v
in "the troll in central park"
I love documentaries
03so do I
But not in theatres
03but typically I watch documentaries about science XD
03like Nova
Earth and Oceans was good
03that was a good show
03back when they used to air it LOL
Because well, it's Disney
its so ironic this guy created the "secret of niym" movie
03EW DISNEY
And it's not ALL about one animal
03Secret of NIMH was alright
and yet he went to levels like
03but the book was better
12Secret of Nym bored me
Rock-a-doodle
seriously
12I only watched it a couple of years ago as well
12and I didn't make it to the end I don't think
never see rock-a-doodle
12Or maybe I did but I forgot the end
03it's NIHM
03er
03NIMH
12Yeh yeh
03not nym
12HAHA LOL
03I actually really liked the book
Spirited Away is one of the anime movies that I'll never not like
12I don't care what it is, I didnt like it
12XD
03it's a lot deeper than that
it'd be like coraline
03as it's about science
12OH GOD
only it doesnt suck
03:P
/me dies
12THAT MOVIE SUCKED
which one?
12Ok not "sucked" but I didnt see the appeal
You really think so?
12Spirited away
coraline or spirited away?
ah
12It's too stupidly random :/
I saw it
Coraline, I like Coraline
it was a meh for me
03Coraline looks stupid
12There's like, no plot.. well hardly
the book, coraline was good
03honestly I Hate most animated movies made these days
the movie
03HTTYD was pretty good, Pixar movies are good
03most other ones, no.
03not at all.
12LOL I googled Rock-a-Doodle XD
12It looks crap XD
was like how jurrassic park was SUPPOSE to turn hout
Arti: I saw it
12Although it looks familiar somehow..
12Does it start with a sunrise? XD
it ENDED don bluths career respectablly
Yes
12Because I swear I saw that once..
12-v-

12Well thats all I remember LOL
03<Brother> was like how jurrassic park was SUPPOSE to turn hout <-- what?

I really like Jurassic Park 3, not so much for the second one and kind of yes for the first
03what was wrong with Jurassic Park?
03EW JURASSIC PARK 3
/me yawns
03that movie SUCKED
Drf: No no
03the first one was good
03the second was alright
03the third was like, WHY DID YOU MAKE ME WATCH THIS
jurassi park was suppose tp turn out like how coraline was
with clay figures
No
Nooooo
12I saw the 3rd in the cinema but was too young to remember anything XD
Not ever
only with coraline it looks as if someone stabbed me
03wait what?
03they were gonna make JP a claymation? o_O
yes
03WTF?!
*Gag*
03I mean, I know the Weird Al video was
03but eh
03Jurassic Park, the movie, is really good
03I can't picture it being different
I love it XD
I have, sadly, all 3 movies >>
they 'say' they are going to be making a 4th
12DRF theres this one guy in Jurassic park that reminds me of you XD
Rumor
03what, the bad guy?
Rumors suck
03Nedry?
the guy that gets eaten?
/me dies
Yes
03Brother, LOL, half of them get eaten
12Yeh ^^;
The one that hacks the security system
exactly
/me runs
the fat one, of course :P
03yeah, Nedry DOES remind me of me
03only I wouldn't do that
03be evil like that
12Uh uh uh.... you didn't say the magic words..
03but I might work security for a park... XD
you'd be good
Then get eaten?
03<Brother> I have, sadly, all 3 movies >> <-- so do I
03I have a 3-in-one DVD packj
03-j
I have VHS

which is the best movie you have seen drf?
I like Tim Burton movies, but Alice in Wonderland's talking jaberwakke and 9 SUCKED
*jaberwokke
129 looks rubbish
03Brother, Independence Day
Yes they did
03that's my alltime favorite
Made him talk
he's suppose to talk
And say, "my ancient enemy" to Alice
or semi
03Need I go on>?
No it was bad
...
03er Roland
I'm sorry but it was just baaad
03w/e
"my acient enemy"
This is why I prefer
The dragon talked at the most possible worst time
for not only is it a game
but they make the jabberwokke
LOOK like a jabberwooke
9 just plain out sucked
drf: saw it, kindas loved it
It made no sense and it made me fall asleep
kinda hated it
9 the movie, or 9 the comcerial?
for theres 2, if you can believe it
03Brother, why did you hate ID4? o.o
9 the movie
Not to be confused with Nine
ID4?
03Indepdence Day
03ID4 is its nickname
where does the 4 come from?
034th of July
Independence Day was cool
..XD
03yeah
didnt see that
03it's seriously my favorite movie
03I, Robot is another of my favorites
03no I don't have a fetish for Will SMith, his movies are just always gooed XD
03-e
well I 'hate' it because mostly I dont really see how everyone else is like
"well we're too stupid to think of a plan"
"so lets just wait"
03LOL
03well
I've always liked Will Smith movies
03if you came across aliens with force fields that human technology couldn't breach
03what would YOU do>?
Nothing
send chuck noris and bill nye
/me dies
LOL
03LOL
well truthfully I would gather forces and wait for some idiot to attack
then exploit it and hopefully find a weakness
and then kill the idiot
14What a tiring but awesome day I've had!
03Brother, well, whatever
03still, ID4 was an awesome movie
it was semi-awsome to me
03it just had a lot of awesome elements rolled into one XD
Just so you know, the man upstairs is a euphemism for God
I know
that guy at the end, was the best part XD
I just didn't want you running upstairs looking for some guy
14Hai
/me huggles
"I'm coming back!" *blows up ship*
epic moment right there
There is no man upstairs, I have no second floor
I'm hopefully going to be more active soon
Depends if I get a laptop and abuse it to my needs
It's a line for KoQ
10also, I can't click full view on it
Me neither

/me runs

In boredom, I have decided to bring up a Disk IBSYS system on a virtual IBM 7094.
I'm just about to hit the Return key (to start the script that does it)... and what should VLC decide to play?
Richard Strauss' "Also Sprach Zarathustra". :P

03*DVD
Some people aren' t even active anymore
people come and go~
Yup
And some people create drama for it
of course. If there's no drama then it wouldn't be humans who participated in it.

MTG is cool too, but reminds me of MTMG

that sounds so horribly rage-inducing that it doesn't even amuse me. And sorry for any insensitivity, I blame it on someone else later.

2o3o
2lol
2I shall go
2take my geekiness elsewhere for the time being
2mostly YT and Nico
lol nicovideo. I've only ever seen one video that didn't make me question the collective IQ of entire demographics there.
I mean, cya
then again, taking the amount of youtube vids i've seen the ratio is probably quite similar...
6EEE
6I finished today's adventure at AnimeNEXT. :>
2eh
2I'd say the difference is the filtering XD
2like... if you copy someone else's work onto Nico, you get busted REAL fast
2now bbl again~
that either means people actually have ethics, or that it's full of wannabee detectives.
whatever way you want to look at it of course.
hi
anyone here?
2nope
ANYONE Here???
2you're alone

2well we're certainly on the same page
2just in different books
6I actually care about pageviews. :P
6*lateish*
well, as long as you don't obsess over them then It's fine
but if you do... then you should pretty much get your kneecaps busted
/me shot

Hi
hey
how are you?
good, you?
better
than I was before
were you at church too?
no
we went shopping for fathers' day gifts
ah
Casey and I are going to do that tomorrow after work
Got some chocolates and a rubber case for the HTC Incredible
Oh cool
liberal chocolates?
:P
lol
No
is he getting himself the phone or is that part of the gift?
My mom bought it for him
12roaraaaaaaa
He already knows about it though
ah
She said she's never seen him this excited about anything in her life
Well that's cool
06breeeeeeeeeeee
12yay
What's he looking forward to about it?
is he into maing apps?
ohai
*making
or is he just excited at the sheer amount of things it can do?
He's not much of a programmer
x3
so I don't think so
6Ohai, Rora.
6*late*
needs more e's
06breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
he does know come programming, right?
*some
is that enough? :P
for now
What phone is it?
6Random comment: 'Happiness is fish love.' Ovo
HTC Incredible
And yeah, probably some
06wut
do you know what languages he knows?
o3o
No
It's mostly theory I think
just the concepts
yeah
fish... love
6And I actually know what that's a reference to.
like that computational theory class we have to take one of these years
Hmm, there's not much in PS3 homebrew, but what there is is quite cool.
they already have back to college ads on the Walmart website
Homebrew with NATAL, kinnect, and move will be cool.
homebrew?
what's that?
I wonder if The Darkness is on the PC
Basically when you run hacked firmware on your console, and run programs made by people who aren't the developers of the console.
lol
so a hacked console basically
DS homebrew can allow you to go on IRC for example.
I should've known with you
:P
Wii homebrew can let you use play the radio.
oh cool
o3o
DS IRC
/me wants
me too
There's even a hombrew for controlling your computer with your DS.
O.O
like how?
turning it on and off and stuff?
You could if you wanted to.
You run a program on your computer, then the DS connects to a specified port, (password protected if you want) and the program basically sends images of what you would see on the computer screen to your DS, which it displays.
You touch the screen to control the mouse.
And use various buttons for other things.
woah, that's cool
/me wants to hack his DS now
Means you have to buy something though. :P
I'd buy it
how much?
:P
The original was the R4 (I've got it), there are others out now though.
lol, if it's not too expensive I would too
06ra
The main use of it is playing pirated games.
But it can be used for music, and homebrew, etc, which is completely legal.
I'm sure it's something like that
looks like you also need a micro SD card
/me googles homebrew
I don't have one of those
I do! :D
2hi Feather
They might supply one with purchase, check.
2^-^
I think I have an extra one even...
Ohh, yes it does
But do you have a microSD -> SD convertor?
yeah
/me yawns
http://www.r4ds.me/r4ds.html
06ra
To get a full list of all the newer ones search for DS flash card.
04ohai Roara
Oh, and if you do get one, make sure it's for the right DS.
06hi :>
lol, I could see myself making that mistake
07ohai
07o3o
06kyuuuuu you better appreciate me for all this
12o-o
06still redesignin the plush
04lol
06again
07o3o;
2well that was slightly creepy
2._.
06yes you are
2lol
I wonder what the 3DS is like.
2these two skateboarders were following me while I walked my dog
$22.49, not bad
It'd be hard to see properly from a preview.
2or rather, ran after I heard them put their skateboards down
04lol
07btw
2apparently they thought I was someone named Louis
2o-o
07i watched toy story o3o
yeah, that's something you'd have to see in person
04lol
06you liked it?
when is it coming out?
03you know, they never actually say what number to call
2oh, there's a Toy Story O3o now?
03so it's kinda hard to
14BACK~
/me 2explodes
07yeah
2TWI- sofjdlsajfd
07it was awesome
/me 2splats
Can't remember if they said on E3 or not.
06yesssss
03TS3?
07although a bit overdramatic lol
2XD
14I GOT THE NEXT TWO VOLUMES OF POKEMON SPECIAL~
I doubt I'll buy one
/me spazzes*
2:D
2...
2wait
06yes there were some way dramatic parts
Unless I magically start making a ton of extra money
a 3DS or one of these cards?
2aren't there only 7 that were actually released in English?
3DS
2.... oh wait nevermind
2duuuh
/me 2facepalms
I'm really considering buying the flashcard
me too
2anyway, I'm gonna go take a shower o3o
04k
/me gives Kyu a Lots-o-hugging plush instead of a kyu plush
I think some people are gunna be a bit annoyed about them bringing out the DSi and 3DS so close to each other.
07*spoiler alert* totally should have had something worse than that happen though o3o
I wish SR had just sent me his extra one like he said he would lol
04lol
the temptation to not use it for cheating and pirating will be strong
06yeaaaah
06but
:P
06it was pretty awesome
06you know who that driver was, right?
Come to the dark side.
04why did they wait so long for the sequel>
*the temptation to use it
06lyon, all the movies up until Wall-E had been planned
SR was gonna send you one of those cards?
04oh
06Toy Story 3 was planned around Nemo/Cars time
06so they had to wait
Yeah.
06btw
04ah
04?
06Monsters Inc and Cars are both having a sequel
I gave him my school address and everything
But he never sent it
06MI 2 is going to be first
:(
was this a while ago?
14Monsters Inc?
06because that one's actually confirmed
arg a Cars sequel?
14Oh boy, my dad is gonna spazz
/me flees
HE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE! :P
I think it was like... October? November?
MI sequel was expected from its ending
ah
06there was a girl in TS3 that looks like a Boo a few years older (they always introduce a character from the next film in their movies)
2o3o
maybe school confiscated it
:P
it just yelled "HEY, another sequel coming"
Nah
hey...
I think he just forgot
they knew it could be used for illegal game downloading
:P
/me is poked quite a few times
yeah, like they open my mail
2anyway, by- OHMIGOSH
2O_O
2IT'S YOU
guess what
to be honest, I didn't picture SR as the DS type
2you kill people
ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM
2that's what
that's all
2bbl again
Where's my USB, I need it for PS3 homebrew. D:
I played him on Mario Kart once
Alright... I have discovered What Not to Do When Using Disk IBSYS. Namely... what I thought was the printer, overwrote the operating system. (Oops...)
I remember you telling me that
He had to steal one of his brothers' DSes to for it though
yeah
it was fun
Also The Darkness FTW
that's what I would've thought, that he used someone else's
I can't see him having one is all
He'd probably have one just for the sake of having one
.....
he's always buying random crap
yeah
the benefit of being rich
>.>
well look where it's got him
14LOL
Nowhere good.
14X3
Woo, found my USN.
USB*
yeah
USN, lol
Yeah, I was gonna say, what's a USN?
"Money can't buy you happiness", not yet it can't.
lol I agree with that actually dari
Soon I'm sure you'll be able to buy something that stimulates the brain in such a way that it would be if you were happy.
I don't want to be rich really, it'd just be nice to be able to get what you wanjt when you want it
:P
heya
that would be false happiness though :(
cheated happiness
/me pokes at the hawk
/me pokes everyone
Yeah, I'm just saying I think that'll be possible not too long away.
/me collapses in on himself!
o.o
yeah, I wouldn't be surprised
lol
that would be so controversial though
if that really happened
in my opinion it'd be with good reason
I wouldn't like the idea of forcing happiness
And then, like everything else, people would grow to accept it and stop complaining
I agree though
I don't think it would be a good idea
it's like taking away your ability to think properly
and be human even
14...How in the world did my sister sleep on an innertube...? ._.

14@Aurora: It's so stupid, it's funny
06see, some characters are ok

12Brother
To be honest, it is for small children, so it would be unlikely that it entertains you. :P
06Barnacleboy, Sandy, Mr. Krabs (for the most part), and the guy who, in every episode, shouts "MY LEG!"
06they're ok
03I like the Band Geeks episode
12could it be because he synbolizes capitalism?
03of SpongeBob

That's my mom's fave episode
12Roara
03indeed
Well he actually is like the worst boss you would have
12what about Pearl?
03it's actually by David Glen Eisley
and what you said o3o
06"the winner takes all........it's the thrill of one more kill, the last one to falllllll will never sacrifice their will!
but I hate plankton too XD the only person I side with is the fish in the opening
14LOL
03Aurora, have you heard the full version?

04what do you mean "kill the server"
/me has CS5 for ages now
!floof
/me flooooooooofs all over Espeon "Bow down to my floofiness!"
03!tk
10Gtg already :<
04hi Quilava
hi
04how goes
okay I suppose
04i see
04http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/anotherfunmatch.png?t=1277032190
04i kind of raped that match
lol
nice
04i think my favorite kill was on ashe
04i just got wit's end and she popped her head up, i quickly unload like 10 rounds into her and just mana drain the heck out of her, then she ran and died from poison lol
rofl
04my favorite teemo kill overall though was in a different match
04i got killed and was waiting for respawn
04all of a sudden i get a kill like 10 seconds into respawn, turns out someone died because they ran into one of my little traps XD
THAT happens often :P
04yeah
04but his reply was like "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"
its especialy funny, if they run from you and right into your trap :P
04i rarely put the traps in the path
some do it to farm mobs :P
04i usually leave them in the little trails that lead into the lane
04as a ganking safety measure
and grass :P
the grass is a good place :)
04yeah
04i usually put it right in front of the grass though XD
04so when they come out of hiding to gank me, they instantly got smacked
04i'm starting to hate that guy
04forgot his name but he has endless rage as a ulti
....
i hate him :P
sure :P
04i hate him as well but if he uses his ulti
04i just blind him
04then keep hitting him lol
RAWR
:P
we need to actually play a game sometime :|
04i want to mess with Tristanna sometime D:
you got a free runeslot, glacy :P
04minus an n
and afk for 3 mins - then im playing some :P
04well the thing i like about her the most is her innate ability
really nothing to talk about huh.
humm
its not all that useful until you're past level 12 or so
04i know
i wonder what happen to ecnet
04but still, if used right, that is an advantage
and I never figured out if it effected her skills range too..
04i'm not fully sure
04well her Q ability
04i don't think it really matters
04the others i'm not sure
mmm.
it seems the ecnet servers are not resolving
04hi Altair of doom
bla @parents - afk for some more mins :I
back :)
/me pokes Quilava
/me squeaks
we wanna play now? :P
I don't know your IGN yet :|
Kinian
oh. and I could start pretty much any time. I'm just editing my playlist a little
ah :P
im ready now *G*
adding another game's soundtrack
04hmm
ok I'm ready
just waiting for you (both?)
who is going to invite? :)
inviting then :)
hi :D
afk i gues - one quick game then :)
2hi
wats up
04sigh
bla wb :I
04heh thx..
04my mood is really dead
3Derp?

14O.o
I have never been to ecnet
!google ecnet channels
No bots again :|
right
The main website is down too...
Have you tried pseudo server?
yes
Weird
try ecnet.epic-chat.net
that works
...Why does that work
lol
'-'
/me pre-dodges
Hahaha
:O
hai kipi
*huggles*
Lady? :3
/me snugs quite thoroughly~<3
I like the sound of taht X3
think we should surrender? :P
afk - worldcup
Yush. :o If there ever were someone deserving of that title, 'twould be thee.
brazil vs. ivory coast :D
I love you too! and missed you bunches beyond what cha would believe C:
gooo brazil!
:(
/me preemptively dodged Kyu
hu?
04i surrender the second i can surrender XD
lame :P
04then if i get outvoted
04i just refuse to fight
/me pounces again
fight till the end! :P
*smiles and cuddles kipi more*
04a smart person chooses his fights
04if you think victory is out of reach you retreat :P
I lost a fight because someone refused to help even though it would have been 4v3 >.>
lol
07o.o
:(
annie or shaco? :P
04it's still possible to lose a match 4v3
huh?
left you alone i mean
pfft
I meant a different game
rejected
oh
wut
*purrs*
04it's harsh but when i don't feel like continuing a match, i don't feel like finishing it
Especially because half the time, you can win.
then leave the game
04and get a penalty? lol
better then looking like an ass to the whole team
hai
03rape.
04what are they going to do
Report you.
04go around telling everyone i'm an ass
There's a report button now.
omgosh :P
Yeah. :P
04oh well, they can't ban you for not participating in a match
I'm pretty sure they can.
they probably can
They can do whatever the hell they want.
It's their game.
if you want to build a leave-name, go for it :P
*leaver
most games ToS usually state they can ban you for whatever reason they want
04i'm sure they will ban you for whatever reason
04but think of it like a police standard
/me sighs :P
04what is more important to you, banning someone who swears and flames and all this junk
04or the person who just refuses to continue a match
I'd say the latter, honestly.
I can handle someone flaming as long as they play the freaking game.
04i'd say the first, it wrecks everyone's mood
04the 2nd just wrecks the moods of the people who were paired up with him
Well, they'll never get a handle on that.
ignore works well :P
04a lot of people aren't aware of ignore :P
04took me awhile to notice it
Well, that's their problem. :P
Just as it will be your problem when you get banned.
04i'm just saying that if i can get banned for not playing a match
04after i lose a match i should report the entire team and hope they find a reason to ban them as well, it's likely
Justice is blind. IF you want to get innocents banned, that's your own probelm.
*problem
04like you said, justice is blind :P
12o-o
Your point?
04my point is is that it's so easy to take advantage of
Hey
04which is why i have no hope for this world lol
Not really.
/me just randomly talked to LugiaBot O.o
They use the number of times you're reported as judgement.
Did it insult your mother?
not sure
04so
14LOL
14NO
Which means that if you're an ass, you're much more likely to get banned.
04i just make like 20 accounts
04and report them with each account
04they can probably trace the ip
04but it's something worth trying
04I would hope not .-.
Ugh, never mind. You're missing the point.
He made a clone server or something Someone did it on Chatspike for DALnet once
04my point is is that if i can get banned for not playing a game
04where's the line, next they are going to ban people for totally unrelated factors like having long hair
04i have good reasons for not finishing a match if i don't desire to
14It was like
Uh, that's a DAMNED good reason to ban someone.
14"I live in Articuno's computer. Where do you live?"
This is a multiplayer, TEAM game.
14I was like,
04not really, if anything they should ban the reporters for being such crybabies over a game lol
14"Somewhere over the rainbow"
So it was like; "OK I'll blow it up then"
That's beside the point! You're ruining their game experience. Ergo, you will be eliminated from it.
14But it cant
14I live in the 16th dimension
o3o
14In the 5th Universe
04if they weren't such crybabies who complain about every single thing, they wouldn't have a problem in the first place lol
6Speaking of, is Arti coming today?
14On the 5th planet
6I gotta show her a piece of Lugia merchandise from AnimeNEXT. :>
04those who complain and whine are likely to do it again
Uh, yeah, they would. You, my friend, are the one being the crybaby. "Waaah, waaah, I'm losing the game!"
14Going somewhere~ Later.
14I WILL CATCH ENTEI AND RAIKOU.
14RAHRRRRR
what if you dont? D:
04now you are missing my point :P
04i don't complain if i lose a game
/me 6is getting Sine Qua Nons in AQ Oco [sic]
04in fact all i've done was lose games this week, i'll lose like 6 or 7 games in a roll and win one, then repeat the pattern and never complained, even if it irritated me
You stated yourself that if in a surrender vote, you are outvoted, you just sit at the base.
04yes
04a friend once told me the number one rule of the game is to not die
04i only surrender if i think it's impossible to get a kill without being killed
Yeah, well, he's wrong.
The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent's nexus.
It doesn't matter how many times you die as long as you do that.
04sure that's the goal
04but how do you do that if you die every 3 minutes
04and feed their team
I've done it before.
Multiple times.
04you have to admit it's a lot easier if you don't do that though
04less money for them, less items
Not really.
5v5 is much better than 4v5 with less items.
04however true that might be, it's still missing the point
04you should avoid dying at all costs unless your team gets some sort of extreme benefit from it
04think about it this way
04if you die
04the match is temporarily 4v5 while you wait in respawn
04an advantage that can easily taken advantage of
It's better than a 4v5 over the game.
04true
04it's still a possible win though
04my first ever real match all i did was die and barely contributed everything and my team-mates carried through lol
04and still won
/me chews on Kyu's ears
/me attempts to draw something
GOAAL
07nooooo
Which is exactly my point.
04then what is your point
Don't be a douche and sit at the spawn point. :P
04at least at the spawn point i'm not feeding enemies lol
04:/
04however true it might be what you said about 5v5 and 4v5 with less items
04i still don't like giving free money to enemies
04i don't want to be the one flamed for giving them that
You'll be flamed MUCH more for sitting around doing nothing.
04i'd rather be flamed for sitting around
unless you're the same as this guy here who's IGN is pretty much 'douchebag'
04i'll have you know i've done that like 4 times
04even said i'm not going to play anymore
04and no one ever complained XD
04however i have been complained at many times for dying like 10 times and getting like 2 kills
And how would you have seen it if you weren't there?
04actually a couple times people joined me XD
You never answered the question.
04seen what
If anyone complained.
04i'm in spawn point
04i can see the chat very clearly
So, what, you were just sitting there waiting for the game to end?
04pretty much
04from time to time i'll actually pretend i'm doing something by laying traps around the nexus
So you're purposefully lying to your teammates.
04hey i wanted to surrender 8D
Ugh. Remind me never to game with you.
04ok
o.o
Is there any particular reason for this immaturity than "I wanted to surrender, they didn't, so I'm going to just sit here."?
tbh if you enjoy what you do in a video game I fully condone it even if people rage at you. Unless you're using exploits or cheat.
:3
sorry for that try on teemo - wasnt payingattention for a moment to kill his stupid shroom :(
Espeon: The game in question is a 5v5 team game.
04most of the time
Or 3v3
why did we just surrender?
0480% of the time people DC like the first 2 minutes of the game
because their they had 2 chars, that could own us 1vs3 already
teemo + yi :I
both nicely fed at the start of the gmae :(
<.>
04and that's why feeding is bad
obviously
i wouldnt speak so loud :P
1 week ago, you were trying to convince me from the other side - sacrificing to may-be kill an enemy etc... :P
04why
>:3
well unless it's a competitive match or you've "promised" to actually play serious/your best then I still think the same way.
lol
and answers like "so what? then i die - so? they get those 400 gold, so what? "
It is competitive.
04it's only competitive to the people who play it competitively :P
Then RESPECT those people.
Unless you don't want respect yourself.
04respect is over-rated
/me sighs
04it's never got me anywhere lol
Um
It's never competitive by default
Espeon: It's like DotA, if you've ever played it.
Well I have
I mean, if people get mad at a videogame because of me when I'm not even provoking them then I see that as their problem.
I understand what you mean and respect it - if you want to mess about don't pull those who try to win down with you :P
Well there's a difference between griefing and using a "nooby gun" or something. I can understand getting mad at the first, but the latter is just lolable.
There's only one real 'mode' to LoL thus far, and the champions are oft-patched.
oh hey, my win percentage is exactly 33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333%
04playing his way is just a habit i picked up from halo
04if all i'm doing is getting killed then i remove myself as a factor, in hopes that my team can turn things around with me gone
you got realy bad luck with your teammates then, quil :)
then hit alt F4 and leave
at least early on
same here
I can hit them till they need to go back to base, but that's mostly as close as I get
unless they're stupid and come at me with less than 200 hp
they always escape with low health
04early on it's almost impossible without the right champion or a bad enemy
but... in the last 2 games, you were good in that :P
even chasing past the tower and then abuse the range to kill the afk-guy :P
actually he had left the game/disconnected, lol
oh :P
no, if he would have left the game, he wold auto-port to their base
04what happens to your champ when you DC anyway
moooo
my bet is that you either vanish or just stand there.
He bp's
your computer formats C drive
and I've never played the game
xD
04BP?
and I dunno, it said he had disconnected
04like instantly
04?
maybe he was like. lagging or something
Blue Pill
04i wonder if it's possible to avoid being ganked if you DC
04XD
04ahh
04then that doesn't work
No, it is not.
and that's glitch abuse.
Effectively, you hit b.
that's cord pulling
04with the 8 second waiting time
and that's cheap :(
It doesn't work that way.
04hey how do you know it's a glitch XD
04maybe the programers left it there on purpose to see if they could find someone smart enough to take advantage of it
You're just an easy target if you d/c.
I remember that games used to not record any stats if you disconnected. They clearly overestimated how fair people are
some games at least
note the 'take advantage of it' part
that means its a glitch
*COUGH*
04knowledge is a powerful tool
04even if it doesn't work for me lol
It's not a glitch because it DOESN'T WORK.
You just recall to your spawn.
From wherever you are.
04if everyone can do it, i don't really see it as a glitch
wow ok. then by your standards, nothing is a glitch
04hacks are glitchs
04lol
..hacks are hacks
glitches are erros in the game itself
04hacks are hacks which also are glitches XD
*errors
04see my point? the fact a game can be hacked is a glitch in itself
they aren't glitches.. people actually EDIT the game itself when they hack
glitches != hacks
this argument is pointless. I'm done.
Hacks are user-created coding inserted into the game.
Glitches are mis-coded segments.
a glitch is a programming error that can be exploited
or sometimes it's just funny
04it is possible to prevent them though depending on how you have the server programed
04like if the server scans the program before it allows connect and if it sees a difference in the programming it doesn't allow the connect

12If I planned in advance though, who would come to Florida for the TST meert?

13yeah
5The keys have no feelings. They are not sentient.
2lol
13but they are key
13keys*
5Thus it is illogical to assume that they have any feelings to be hurt.
2memory is the key
5Therefore I can yell at them as I please. (:
13but if your nice to them and respect them then they last longer
12Im gonna run a bath, brb
14kk
5All right Arti.

ohai lyon
04hai
hi and good night :)
umm

14LOL
04lol
/me is drawing Yellow in the Oekaki O.o
12so that's it...if Warriors becomes an anime, I'll send in songs for BOTH an opening and closing theme o3o
04lol
04they'd probably make their own songs
12I knowwwwww
12but
12I might write/e-mail them :o
song you made or know?
04lol
12both are songs I like (and they would only work of it became an anime since they're BOTH i Japanese)

Lyon: but its so...tedious o3o
04lol
12and I just had an epiphany, May o3o
you have to find 9 wayshrines scatered through out cyrodill
and if you decided to be evil and kill someone during the quest that isnt a evil person, you have to do the pillage again o3o
but then even if you do it after the quests end, you can't wear the armor
/me blahs
12I guess that's the problem with sleeper hits...
12they and their sequels are less known...

06well that's a horribly pessimistic way of looking at things
you may find people in here who've made their own friend groups, but not something to really call a clan or a guild
6What, talking is bad?
06we talk and enjoy time, we don't like focusing on one thing and one thing only
not if theres fighting
focusing on one thing is boring anyway
03hi
that's called role playing
06I hate places where it's 24-7 "WIFI BATTLE TOURNEY ATTACK POKEMANZ NOW"
06here we actually get to know one another
who said anythign about 24-7 0.0
06if that still works
6Ovo
6DEMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYX
06^^ it works
i jsut want to find a group that fights within it
we... THEY battle each other every once in a while, but as a friendly battle
06LOL how do you expect us to fight?
6And what was that exactly for, Rora?
wifi duh -.-
06I mean yeah...I can name a couple people I hate to no ends here

darn
i just edited it
?
haha
i created an Anti-Apes club
on the forum
yay!!!
ok what?
I haven't been on the forum in a few days
she should of picked dogs
acknowledge everyone but me...:(
something more intelligent
lol
I said hey to you first
apes and monkeys are dumb
I've had a [censored]ty day now everything's making me [censored]ed off
just didn't say your name
kind of reminds me of how I'd always stay on the computer and the video games longer just to defy my parents' constant complaining about it
Its sad that theres been such a disconnect with the current generation and their grandparents.
>>
:(
A few years ago I told myself that wasn't going to happen with me and my grandparents, and it turned out really well, im very close with my grandparents on both sides, even closer to them than my parents.
:|
are you one of those people that think that wolves are better than anything else in the world
is there anything I can do to make it better?
:'(
I rarely see any of my grandparents
My mom's parents live in Louisiana
no.
06it actually looks like a fox head now
i'd be close to my grandparents if they were reasonable... if they had it there way i'd be wearing dresses every day and those hoop skirt things..
o_O
i prefer shorts all year round ^-^
everyone in this world is a doucchebag nothing new
Theres no real method of reconnecting like I did
D:
its just something you have to want to do.
ah
I AM A WOLF
RAWR
lol
yip yip
12lol
lol
/me is gone scribbling lol
hah
he/she/it said that dogs should have been the enemies in tlos because they're "more intelligent" than apes and monkeys
im supprised that game hasn't been long forgotten or something
that game sucked
06ad now Im officially late for work :>
It was forgotten by me before it even came out
I wish I would have kept it
lol
lol
ick i'm not reconnecting with them.. we just argue and they criticize
well it's pretty hard to get along with everyone in your family
i was lucky... i never had monkeys
I didn't know she worked
14yeh friends are here
03yeah she does
i had wolves >>
Not for me.
and I have a pretty diverse family.
19 year olds work you know
i love wolves
they're intelligent
and they don't smell like poop
they're like every other freaking animal
yes they do.
I don't really dislike anyone in my family; I just don't get along with them all
some of which are extremely opinionated.
everybody smells like crap
they don't throw it
they're pretty to look at
and they're not annoying
Like, opinionated to the extent they will tell you they will kill you for thinking otherwise.
Like I'm pretty sure my only female cousin on my dad's side thinks I'm some kind of freak
brb moving class might DC
yes they are, their wolf howls that every little emo anime child says is "beautiful and sad" makes me want to kill a baby.
i wonder if jlf likes twilight...
But we just don't talk much so it doesn't really matter
rather hear that than an ape cry
lol
ask then
Probably
*them
"JACUB 4EVER"
Most girls like twilight
do you like twilight
the books
only
I would rather watch a cow get slaughtered
ha
the books only
the movies suck
edwurd x jakoob 4ever
lol
It really is dependant on your personality, all I can tell you is one of the most interesting things ive ever done was get to know my grandparents, and its an amazing relationship to have with them.
lol
:P
:P
lol
homos
:P
:D
:(
you ruined the chain
combo breaker
infa z you ass
I got to see my paternal grandfather for the first time in 13 years last weekend
</late>
lol, you're not late
im no democrat (cringes at rdx looming)
/me is an ass
my aunt was cussing at me for being Taoist yesterday
:O
Its weird too, I have friends who talk the same way about their grandparents. But then, ive actually talked with their grandparents before on occasion and find them to be the opposite that my friends portray them to be.
speaking of ass... there were several [censored] in disneyworld...
AHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
urhglhrh
not opposite, just not as exaggerated.
she was like "you
are not a taoist"
what was the censored?
ass es
yeah
funny how that works
are you back from florida yet?
My paternal grandfather just likes to talk about art all the time
yeah...
yesterday was aweful
the usa sucks doesnt it
And I only see my mom's parents like once every one or two years
around 15 hours on the road
usa is a lot better than a lot of other countries
mine was in the navy (pat. grandfather) for 22 years...so yeah...lot of stories ._.
yeah not too much can be done if you cant see them ever.
Stories are awesome.
I'm sure a lot of it was BS though >_>
lol
XD
He's a great guy tho
/me got rick rolled at applebees today
lol!
by what?
you know, I thought some of the stories my grandpa told were far fetched too
03o.o
they played the song on the restaraunt's radio
I want a donut.
but he took me to a class reunion of his, and either they are all BSers or they are all true.
lol
haha
racist
my brother was telling me that he should work as a set designer at disney world and when they have their finale show at night... rick roll 30,000 people all at once
idk what the hell your talking about kiddo
My grandpa loves to write fictional stories in his spare time as well.
i'm a diff religion than my family
Im sure he gets enough lying done there :P
and my aunt thinks i'm a bad person
Hahaha
cause of that
we always joke about him being a professional lier.
lol
i wonder if that would break a record
hah
yup
:(
how old is he spyro..
I wish I knew what to listen tooooo :(
he just turned 61
listen to angry music
lol
see he's easier to get along with then
i don't have a full rick astley album on my computer right now otherwise I totally would
i was gona say that but i would proably get slapped
my grandparents are in their 80's
Anyone seen the MGS Rising trailer?
You should make a video of that song!
:D
My grandparents on my mom's side are in their 60s
heres a pic of him from his realestate website http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2827825/pic.jpg
but my grandpa on my dad's side is 82 I think
so*
akunamatata esque
I've done it actually
a loooooong time ago
on wmm
with happy feet
don't have the file anymore though
Dude!
My grandparents are in their 70s I think
That can be my first AMV!
03o.o
o.o
I think its probably easier to get along with grandparents who grew up in the 60s.
you're making AMVs?
All of my grandparents but one either do or have had cancer
:(
anyone have any opinions about this?
!stats
!chatstats
I'm thinking of giving it a shot
I did
nope
Heh
I liked it
my grandma had breast cancer twice.
yay :D
U
I like that cover of that song
03!stopitns
/me runs
run it yo
and XD
my mom's mom has had breast cancer
anyone think my aunt is racist?
lol
or at least rude?
My grandpa actually codes basic html and css
nah, different song actually
the song I did wasn't never gonna give you up it was 1000 miles the cover was by moneta
I taught him.
My dad's mom had Alzheimers and his dad has all kinds of health problems from smoking
she is allowed to have her feelings on it but she just doesn't know how to keep it to herself
03:3
thats all
lol k
can't please everyone
He has to carry the oxygen tank around everywhere
yeah, I think smoking is what gave all my grandparents cancer
yea
I think Cynder should of been voiced by a different person in DOTD
my grandma quit smoking when he was 26
I'm BAFFLED by how many people loved the beta for it
started when he was 16
that was my most voted out of my two beta videos
oh my god this kid wont shut the [censored] up about tlos

justin long fanatic
in sc
oh
good thing I'm not there
lol

One great grandma was alive for the first 10ish years of my life
Hello~?
yeah his name was R something
!quote
nQuote currently does not have any quotes... maybe you should add some!
he had a pic of a fat kid with a knife
And my paternal grandmother died this year
Anyone here?
as his icon
If I ever knew any of my great grandparents it was too long ago to remember
03:3
yeah it was around then
my great grandpa has been blind for 15 years
same day maybe even
hes starting to really lose his memory too
also only has one hand
I still remember my great grandma
I heard about that
She always talked about sewing
no i mean his name was G something
I remember one great uncle
he was like 5 years old
a few days ago he told my grandma "beckie, I think im going blind"
he died around the same time as my grandma
She taught my grandma who taught my mom
who taught you?
:P
jk
My mom tried
you mean gamhix or whatever lol hes funny
I can sew; I just don't like to often
yeah
I did it for school once
So unless Jenna gets into it, the tradition is going to die
I am awful at it
I can see Jenna getting into it
sooner or later
She does sometimes
Yep
She made herself a purse
looks pretty awesome
oh cool
heard anything else about it other thant the independant motion sword?
I'm surprised at how much Jenna has changed since I've been away
they haven't anounced anythig about the story
She never used to be so popular
and in terms of gameplay that's pretty much it
And never used to like shopping or hate bugs
yea
so not really
before you know it she'll be piercing her eyebrows and lips, wearing all black, and writing emo poety.
hmm
I will slap her if she does that
Hmm, I was under the impression Jenna was always like that
all i'm seeing out of e3 so far is a bunch of weird gimicy sort of things
Maybe as long as you've known her
I wonder if it was just school and new friends and all that changed her
Which isn't very long
he was an ass
i hate him
for the most part I agree
like the playstation's wii wanabe and the xbox kenect
:)
yeah
E3 kinda sucked this year
the only cool new thing was the 3DS
I don't mind her being like that; it's just so different from the rest of our family that I wonder how it happened sometimes
yeah
did u ban him?
speaking of 3d i got my first view of a 3d movie the other day
Which movie?
screwed with my eyes a bit
i dont know.,
oh
u know him?
it was a disney 15 minute thing at the park
Casey is kind of the same
i know u know ratchet
*rolls eyes
she's always been somewhat of a tomboy
:O
i didnt like the water splashing in my face as it felt like someone spat in my face
but she's less of one now

lol, that would be unfair I guess
Well no, not really
mine isn't quite as embarassing
:P
I was an idiot back then, but not enough to be embarassed about
lol, I took the wrong meaning of promise ring again
mostly just stuff like "durrrr what does HTML mean durrrr"
:P
either way
lol
you got me curious
Yeah, you showed me one of their songs once
if you mean The Promise Ring
yes
mine were mainly "Hey guys, look at my bionicle thing I made!"
my screenname has never changed.
I used to look through some of the posts on the old Spyro forums on Neoseeker when I was bored
They're funny to look back on

both had to do with a guy who had superpowers that relied on recharging by grabbing on some sort of source of electricity
not like anyone knows me there anymore
Not planning to go back to that forum, are you?
:P
nah
I wouldn't know what to do there
looks like it has a pretty big community at least
yeah, it's a pretty old forum
I didn't know so many people liked Bionicles
me neither XD
Back then I thought it was only little kids like me who did
I always hated them because the commercials were stupid
is there any truth in you, darkness?
:P
Hahaha
I always used to get excited for the new commercials
...
wow
Chat died for me for some reason owO

Ok, now i am curious
Another Star Trek fan?
And also shocked. Myspace? D:
:<?
http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a294/nytehiker/CaptainKirk.jpg
I'm far from a trekkie.. but a screenshot out of context that'll get you banned. Interesting :p
Post what?
Ahahahahahahahaha xD
yes...my profile was public at the time and someone complained about me posting that..stating it was a sexually explicit pic that their kid saw
12random tummy pain ><
Ypu should see some of my friends pictures, thats hardcore
o_O
when i mentioned to myspace "so it's ok for nbc to show it and kids to watch but not for me to put on myspace?"
Hahahaha
...ya
lol
they promptly gave me my account back
:(
/me huggles LL

What's going on here?
i really wish the spyroworld.net wiki would be up
12nothing much
i need to use it
12I made a new topic o3o
o3o
/me hides
nobody post in it
12D:
12they have tro FIND it first, tho :o
/me flees
12*to
I'm here for 15 minutes
Use that time with me wisely.
12wb
Ty
So any questions or anything for me?
/me makes the Guesst's next 15 minutes as painful as going to HELL...Michigan
/me dies
Lol
I've heard of that place. It's home of a really spicy chilli shop or something.
Ever noticed you have become a pro at 3rd person since IRC
12well, in January it's freezing in Hell
12that's for sure
/me dies again
Indeed XP
yes
lol
And stop doing that
I sometimes start thinking in 3rd person in real life
>.>
You don't need to put a retreating comment to show sarcasm
We can tell
12but it's fun :o
Well keep doing it, then
I've done that ._.
I'll actually want to start sentences with "slash me"
I find it a bit annoying, though
im back
/me dies from dying by dying for dying while also dying for death's deadly sake
/me shot on top of that
I have actually said LOL on the phone before >.<
It makes me think you made a terrible comment.
Haha
I've done that without thinking a couple times
/me brings LL back as a witch
:3
12O3O
And that's the reason I'm here, BTW
This girl on my bus a while back said "omg idk girl" on the phone
/me cries in a corner...
XD
WITCH!
I've... never done that
/me runs in terror,
Me either
I felt sad for humanity after that
Im getting a bit tired of comments that mention "humanity" or "society" in such a general sense.
how about anyone else?
/me is startled by her own amethyst necklace
/me kills herself o3o
Me
I've met more stupid people than smart people
That's why
Especially after that wolf thing on the forum
hello?
anyone?
*sighs
You shot yourself?
"Oh wahh, humanity is evil because we kill helpless wolves"
Im sorry not everyone's intelligence is up to your level.
Where did you get the weapon?
12nu, she slashed herself to "death" o3o
Er, I don't think that's what he's saying
Lol
There's an online petition to put intelligent humans on the endangered species list
I'm not
/me randomly lols
12I'm having a discussion about Pokemon Black and White in a PM
whats up
With whom?
12and we were discussing about how what other gems could be used as titles
i was wondering about the wiki?
/me points to her
yeah i havent had time to upgrade it
Why not bring it to the main chat?
its going to be a pain in the as.
12and she thought of Pokemon Amethyst
ass*
12because it was silly lol
Indeed it is
A quail flew into my boot today while I was riding o_O
o_O
bounced off
12(I'm going to get kicked for this but...)
12here's for an epic announcement:
12Introducing
12Pokemon
12METAMORPHIC!
12thought so o3o
Proto, http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/21/toshiba-libretto-w100-resurrects-the-classic-umpc-brand-with-dua/
Opal doesn't sound that bad, but that was what was intended for platinum. Also, fail
thats a cool design
:p
oh
will u?
12no, I knew it was going to happen
i mean just wondering
i miss it
Awesome
[20:27:12] <Chinmoku_no_BlueWolf> Is it a bad thing when you randomly start naming off Pokemon game names in the style of the gen 3 and gen 4 rereleases? XD
[20:29:14] wutwut
Pokemon onyx
if it has an accelerometer then it might be pretty cool
Hmm
to switch screen orientation
12lolz
I got that PM yesterdayy :>
12how about Magma Ruby and Aqua Sapphire? o3o
pentium U5400...don't pentiums get realy hot, or is that just the pentium 4s?
Onyx black sounds better
12(emphasizing the individual teams)
lol
No
I like burn and ocean better
1.2GHz Intel Pentium U5400 processor
just the pentium 4
its a new processor
k
launched this year
the new pentiums are based on the core architecture
oh i beat Cynder again
so im sure they worked out the kinks
And what about grey?
:p
the old pentium 4s were netburst architecture
slow and ate a lot of power
Y'know, the inevadable title to the sucessor of black and white.
yea I think the U5400 is like 18 watts if I am correct
somewhere in that area
Nice
I like the AMD dual core netbook processors
http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=49156
for a notebook id go with an intel core 2 duo
Is that it?
that's what i have
amd just doesnt give you the speed.
an intel core 2 duo
but any current CPU other then the Atom is core architecture
I have an Atom whichever # the 1.6ghz is
lol
n270
And sky emerald sounds good
Ive seen people make mini servers from atom
yea lol
a lot of home servers use atom
mine 2.2 ghz
sup
was it you that showed us the guy hosting his site on an arduino?
i'm happy with this lappy so far
there was a article I saw the other day that this one server company is making a rackmount with 80 intel atom CPUs
got it late last year
Proto, mariomaster
i think.
funny as heck lol
sleep well
Ah
:)
I'll give you 5 minutes to ask me something else I'm going to sleep
then its worth it.
lots of concurrent processes
it was power efficiency that it was doing really good on
id rather suck power and have a fast server then conserve power and be slow.
but it was priced a reasonable comparison to a zeon unit
xeon
xeon?
lol
yea
/fail
;)
I think xeon is aging now isnt it
you can use a i7 or something and thats much faster than xeon
no they just use new architecture in each line
I think there is I based xeons now
have not looked
Im pretty sure intel just takes its most stable processors from a batch and calls them xeons
but there was also core 2 core quad xeons
well they usually have higher l2 cache and SMP enabled
but yea pretty much lol
for the price, it was perfect,.
Nothing?
and overclocking was quite easy and it works great.
I can't believe the cost for the 1090T
Nighty
yea I was looking at getting a 1055t ....
but I am just going to see about bulldozer next year
my machine is enough till then
i could use a graphics card uograde
and maybe another 4gb of ram
whats your current GPU ?
ati radeon hd 4770
want a 5xxx series I take it ?
just more vram
12ohai Roara~
i only hve 512mb of vram
aaaah
but the 4770 is a very good deal
yea I have 1gb on my 9800gt
yea
for what you get and what you pay.
my lappy has 4 gigs..a huge difference from my desktop which only has 512 mb
o_O
only 512 ?
ack
old laptop ?
eeer
desktop *
pentium 4
Hey Aurora
