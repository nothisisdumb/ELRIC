7Are there any warnings before it crashes?
nope
it just freezes when it wants too and says A Fatal Error has Occured
and its always the same reason
7Does it occur when you do a specific action?
nope
just randomly in time
7Does it occur purely randomly; not, for example, 30 minutes after you start the application?
it occurs purley randomly
purely*
7No logs or anything, I'm guessing, you know of>?

nah
nothing wrong with debating things some times
just gets to a point where it is pointless since nobody will ever back down from it
and it only gets worse at that point
yeah
but when you're arguing about whether or not a cartoon show is good...
that's definitely an argument not worth having

What are you talking about?
owl fantasy forum
Oh.
Surely more members is good?
Near-dead forums like SF aren't much fun.
they always say their friensds are gonna join and make a big deal about it except that their friends never even log on
Hahaha, I love this one.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/test/src/130639051422.png
Honestly, more members isn't always good...
/me still belongs to Umbreon for 12 more minutes
and all they ever talk about in night flight anymore, ammeg especially, is LOL IM TALKING TO "CAPTAIN" ON MY PHONE IM TALKING TO HER ON WEBCAM SHE IS MY BFF OK I CANT CALL HER TERRA
I GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO PEOPLE ONLINE ONCE IVE KNOWN THEM FOR A MONTH
IM SURE A SMART 12 YEAR OLD
Wow.
Then in contradiction she's like "Terra drew pictures of me... which I will NEVER share in this community because that's reckless!"
BUT TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH PEOPLE I DONT KNOW IS TOTES OK
OH NO NERDSQUAD WE CAN'T TELL THE FORUM THAT YOUR BROTHER'S NICKNAME IS GAMER
BECAUSE THAT WILL ACTUALLY EFFECT /ANYBODY/ ON THIS FORUM
yep
Don't you remember venom webcam? :P
not allowed to anyways
but ammeg it's like did anyone EVER explain internet safety to her
@___@;
We didn't talk or show ourselves, but yes, I recall.
To be truthful, I think the whole "The Interweb r dangerouz!!" is a bit overblown, but she's just dumb.
MAYBE I SHOULD SCAN AND POST MY BIRH CERTIFICATE

So what ever happened with that IRC channel idea?
Hahaha.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130688672652.jpg
I really don't see why owlpages would need an IRC
all it would be is ammeg and aw going on about "vegeta" or whatever the fuck it is they go on about and nothing interesting would come out of it
I'm not really around there much so I wouldn't know
I was just wondering
LOL She can empathize with Obama.
She still rbings up her father's "tragic death" every other day.
*brings
I know but how funny would that be to monitor?
epic-chat is just kind of dead most of the time
So more people would be nice
He said he was cool with it, and would promote the channel.
it wouldn't be it'd be the same old crap
Did everyone get that news?
Ah
Oh cool
I never did make that thread over on the chan
I've got a tripcode now BTW.

we aren't talking about ponies

you need to download something for a username?
not directly anyway
why?
10Hiya Light
You don't have a set username and password.
that wont get them to turn the AC on
10or hi Light (hilitghter XD)
hai
10lighter*
lol
You type in a password/code and it will generate a tripcode.
Ouch
XD
No one else knows your password so they can't make that tripcode.
So people see that tripcode and knows it's you.
You could just use anything for the password and it would make a tripcode.
seems pretty ridiculous you'd need to download something for that, henstly
*honestly
But if you use that thing you can get a tripcode with a word in it, or whatever you want.
Like mine is SRBronyGrg. :P
hey! :D
So what's a tripcode?
Sky
Hey. 8D I found you!

Yup, but that's the story of my life. xD
I just figured something out
if you say all the vowels
Oh?
AEIOUMI
Oh... wow.
You're saying it wrong.
:P
You don't enunciate each vowel.
They all run into each other.
I've always read it as Ay-oo-mee.
Aye (as in a pirate's "yes") Oo-Mee here
Sort of like eye-you (for AEIOU).

Hey.
AND I SAID "HEEEEEY!"
Need more people.
Stupid mom won't leave me alone to land a plane
She's always ruining my concentration
well we are most likely on the same timezone now
03hm
03at this point
03I think I should just get rid of my 10 or so Pokémon original series VHS tapes
03since I have the entire season on DVD anyway and as much as they have sentimental value, there's no real reason to keep them
maybe
lol Kairie xD
I still kept the two I have
I'll take them drf
03LOL
03you still have a VCR?
03hm, which two?
yep
03all of mine are the first half of the series (red box) except this on8e, Water Blast
03-8
I need some more
03LOL
it seems silly to have Pokemon episodes on VHS tapes now but I kept mine despite this
Lol what? XD
Hi lol
Hi. XD I'm kind of hungry. .-.
because of course the DVDs are SO much better in quality plus they take up less space
same
We should go eat. XD
Im debating between more frozen yogurt, or ramen
xD
after i finish some of more of this, ill get some food
ill have a wip for you in a few minutes
03yeah
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
Fucking ISP ><
Ahaha cup of noodles for me. XD And alright, I'm going to go to the bathroom really quick then I'll be back for the WIP
plus I tollerate compression artifacts so much more than head noise or FM dropouts associated with VHS tape
03FM?
04bbl
alright, wip's up, I'll pm it to you xD
frequency modulation
03oh, so not FM radio?
Alright. 8D
the video information is contained on VHS tapes as an FM signal
when this information drops out what you see are white bars or lines on the screen depending on how long the dropout lasts
said lines are always horizontal on VHS tape

8link to what?
8the ponychan thread?

4I'm already at the Selection thread on /oat/ but if you think it'd be better to say what I'm gonna say in the Discussion thread on /chat/ then I'll do that instead
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35569858.html
12yay

8so you're basically gonna say pre-show is starting, put video requests in /oat/, right?

I don't see how it's trolling.
Yep.
i loved the katamari damaci refrence lol
8nope.avi
/me rawrs
rebecca black is actually funny
I liked the anthology before the ponies.
did you see that video where she jokes about how it's about consumerism
I wasn't annoyed, I just didn't want you to waste your breath.
Even if it had perturbed me, though, that's weak trolling at best.
random question:
Whatever you say. (:
8hey, thats my thing
what would you do when you've found a old nerf gun in some old boxes?
lol
does it have ammo
yes

but i punched him KO, so that was solved :3
bi-kick clinic?
The one with the technicolour ponies with tattoos on their asses. :p
7this is not orange
bi-kick
7it looks more like skin flesh
And arc is back
9it's also the color of RUURUUS
it's a clinic where you do all sorts of exercises with box dummy's
o.o
odd
someone on the otherside of the dummy though he was funny
hehe

o.o
Eh? I'm orange now?
6Why the name change, out of curiosity?
Oh shii
9okay, link me to that shit so I can install it or something
because i felt like it
You can't use it on mibbit, you need to get a proper client like mIRC. :P
Quick, get rid of the shadow :P
i've had to get fillings before
6Eh, okay.
a couple of them
12lightlugia
12a tooth shaved?

9well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-
12like it grew hair?
9...I have jmIRC on my phone
9does that count?
no
i remember i had to get a tooth drilled or something
I doubt a phone version works with scripts, it might.
so which monty python movie was it you guys watched last week?
It's not hard to install though.
9what do I have to do to run it,anyways?
4Ascresious: Holy Grail
9also, Holy Grail
Just open up the script editor in mIRC and paste in the script. :P
like grinding it
i seem to remember not having anaesthesia but i think because i was 7 or something any pain was scream-worthy
yeah ground or something
I'm so effin jealous... haven't seen any MP movies, ever... *fluttershy dejected look face.jpg*
0I think everyone's seen the holy grail
ouch
i also have crossbite but that's not really an issue
9also, anyways
12a cleaning?
i remember that one
no?
12no they wouldn't drill for that
9IS ANY OF THE MODS WILLING TO USE A PROPER IRC CLIENT?
People often nickname me Ruru for some reason. XD
9cause I'm sticking to this IRC applet because it's handy for streaman
9that, and I'm lazy
@Battle-Brony - I haven't seen it. I simply can't find it anywhere. ANYWHERE. but oh well.
man
its so hot here
i know right
my bottom canine teeth are in front of my top teeth
6Hey, Nick. :>
i think it's my canines
9also, OREENJI-KUN
8lets just do what we did last week with the chat colors for now
it's dark outside, and still 24C
Do we have a countdown timer by any chance for the preshow?
8we can get it worked out during the week in time for next week's
9but the script is handy, Hipster
It'd take less than 5 minutes for someone to install mIRC...
o.o
9and it's ready
And have it running.
0You haven't been able to find it anywhere? Ouch
9I used to...
9.....
9....
what script are you talking about?
/me flees from the shdow lugia and zoroark "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH"
lightlugia: it's 27.8C in my room
6Ovo
/me falcon punches Nick's shadow
6What
hotter outside
6What's with Zoroark?*
9....
Oh yeah, the other thing I wanted to ask was did you want the warnings in the channel or as a notice?
9register
9REGISTER NOW.
ew..that is hot
9the most obvious solution
Do you happen to have any Sweetbays where you live? I picked up a copy of Holy Grail in the bargain bin for $5. Still unsure if I should smile that I got it cheap, or cry that a copy of the Hannah Wisconsin movie costs more.
9is to appoint a script mod
4Does that mean dari will become a mod?
actually that might be exaggerated because my thermometer was behind my laptop but it kind of sounds right
9does half-op work for scripts too, Dari?
7what about Hannah Illinois?
If half-op can kick, then yeah.
hehe
9yes, half-op can kick
9okay, please register your name, you'll be our script specialist op
/me ~NP: Pendulum - The Other Side
Ok, done.
I'm practically tempted to pirate it, but I'm too cautious to pirate anything.
8and im from wisconsin, so dont associate miley cyrus with my people
i think it's supposed to get to 35.5C here
Oh, also I need a list of the nicks the mods use on here.
8arcesious, use filestube
So I can add them to the exception list on the script.
will look up asap
8i use that for music all the time
dunno what the current temperature is
9doesn't that cover everyone so far?
8mister bristle
4Silverscreen
8and lou_cyphre, i guess, is he even coming?
For legal reasons I cannot suggest that you pirate Holy Grail. Now pardon me while I put on my pirate hat.
9he hasn't registered to IRC yet
4If he doesn't show up, he's stripped completely
about 29C
outside
yeah it still looks like pirating. I'm sort of a good-toe-shoes when it comes to the law
:P
8yes, pirating is wrong and we do not condone such activities here
9unless your name is
9Captain Marvelous
8ALL GLORY TO THE RIAA
/me ~NP: Pendulum - Mutiny
Lawl.
OR captain Jack Sparrow
4I don't know Hipster...Alestorm makes being a pirate pretty freaking awesome
9then we just stand with mouths wide agape at your amazing abilities
Alestorm, LOL
Kill all the filthy landlubbers, send them down to the decks below.
8meh, im not into metal
At least out loud we don't. Bweh heh heh.
Scotish pirate metal, so funny.
So anyone seen this movie before? I'm iffy about westerns but willing to give this a chance.
8i havent, but its supposedly a classic
4It's Clint Eastwood, one of the very best in Westerns. I'm sure it'll be good
8pretty much started the "spaghetti western" genre
Oh, well that actor kind of makes it awesome by default, lul
pfff
where did you live again?
corn
4I can guarantee that by the time this night is over I'll be wanting to play Red Dead Redemption
8Clint Eastwood: Great actor, great director, terrible person
....
it's really pretty nice out today
Ghosties: I love RDR
hillow everypony. :3
what is corn?
Yeah, westerns are about as far out of my usual range of genres as you can get. Unless they're parodies like the Frisco Kid.
8hello
csb
4Hello new person
Though since I found out in the expansion you can get a unicorn that trails a rainbow and spawns butterflies I want that now. :<
i'm not too fammiliar with it...
That's the only reason I want it. XD
8also, my roommates and i named one of our fish clint eastwood
8cuz all he did was sit in the corner and get pissed all the time
Hipster Ghosties (^^)/
Hey SirSprinkles! :D
indiana, U.S.
Welcome back
8is that a high five or a heil lol
..wow there's a lot of people here.
strangely...since theres no braodacast...?
AH
brb, chat's being weird
i see
it's usually really humid out as well which makes it feel terrible but it's not bad today
Ok.
There we go.
8broadcast should be starting pretty shortly
Yeah.
This is apparently quite popular, then.
Of course chat's being weird, I'm here. :p
nice
9there we go
lulz halfop goes to the channel
8it is
Shall I volunteer to test this script?
4Holy shit, it's like things have come full circle
4I'm so proud of dari T_T
Did you ever tell me if you want the warning in the channel or as a notice NewDCD?
8we got 225 people last week
I can't remember.
So does this happen every friday then, same time and place?
i still don't feel like going outside though
9how so, dari?
12i can't believe
12that i have to go back to the dentist later
8eyup
9Arcesious: that's the theory, anyways
12to get 6 more fillings
4Arc: pretty much
sweet
12i just had 5 done yesterday
ouch
As a message to the channel - everyone sees it - or as a notice - only the person it's sent to sees it.
oh wow
13Whoo! Bow before the font of Cheerilee!
9only the person sees it
Ok, give me a sec.
when the movie starts i probably won't post much if at all
Ok, all set up I think.
You have it set to warn once, then kick, yes?
*twice
Yeah, ywice.
twice*
13So who wants some Not See Kola? It tastes just like Crystal Pepsi.
8crystal pepsi
8lol
0It's not really a font... it's just a color
4Sprinkles, mah pony!
7Crystal Pepsi? Do want
Took you forever, Ghosties.
4I'm so slow
0:<
0I'm sorry, mr. bot
...
Fail.
lawls
13Nazi soda for everypony!
...hmm.
He didn't get kicked on third post.
8DO NOT WANT
I just turned it off.
0This chat is pretty active...more than the one on irc. :|
it's 10:00PM
We need to test it the whole way though!
Because it kicked someone when they stopped using colours.
i should go to bed....
lawls
Like I said, give me a second.
but i have to finish two more pictures :/
8uh oh, thats not good
0But it tastes like Crystal Pepsi.
Retrospect, probably should have tested this last night.
Yeah, I did.
9and we're live
Arc is confused...
I guess I didn't count on mibbit being annoying like that.
We're live? Still getting offline here...
4Are we still doing video requests, DCD?
0Oh hai Kamen Rider.
:<
9two episodes of Coolguy, following by PMV video requests
Could a mod kick the other me?
8internet derp
I had to refresh
what can i say? it's almost my mom's and my lil' sis her Bday
4Better, Sprinkles?
Yep.
9fun fact: I'm trying something new today
4Cool
9I'm streaming from Media Player Classic
9rather than VCL
4Ohhh, snazzy
why did I get banned for switching back to white?
/me is still not getting feed.
Ok, it should be fixed now, testing on another channel.
err, kicked
Will you maybe work now...?
what exactly is this...?
0Kamen Rider.
beetleborgs?
oh, nvm.
DCD, are you streaming? I'm not getting anything...
9I am streaming
4Refresh the stream Sprinkles
just refresh your video, it'll show up
2lol hey
8refresh
Already have.
I had this problem last week.
8trying closing and reopening it then
14Why the hell not?
Yeah, that's what fixed it last time.
0Beetleborgs was based on the Metal Hero tokusatsu, same creator as Kamen Rider though so it's not surprising they share similar costume designs.
>>; Still offline.
8oh, btw DCD, i think i figured out how i blew up the chat last week
8it wasn't cuz of the level 3 ban
You think?
sup Niggerbro
0You kicked Meebit out, that's how you blew it up. :p
I told you how. Like, right away.

I'm a little girl
8thats because he's MARVELOUS!
0Meh, the non-otaku here wouldn't know the difference between Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Kikaider if they lined up and hit them with their signature attacks anyway.
I guess
/me is sad about that
I'm 10 years old
KUUGA, TSUYOKU ARU TAME NIIIIII
4Sprinkles, you got the video working?
9I'm not otaku

8is it weird that i miss my snuggie right now?
Nope

8CLIMAX TIME!
what. the. heck. is going on in this show?!
I have no idea
Arcesious: Awesome.
._.
Awesome is happening
9COOLGUY beats the shit out of evil.
0Good guy beats the fuck out of the badguys until they explode.
its so awesome but im so very confused
8DONT QUESTION IT
0...what show? I don't see anything. :(
Why he no blue?
wait a sec, shouldn't bee guy die after stinging his victims?
DOTDOTH
he Blue...
he SHOULD
9DON'T THINK TOO HARD ABOUT IT
8dodothree, refresh your page
YOU ARE MISSING A AWESOME SHOW
0Because blue form is a pussy unless he has a stick.
0Only certain bees do that anyway, Derpy.
YAY I GOTTA STICK
AND HE BLUE
DABADEE
Bzzz
Bzzt
Kuuga is so awesome he can red, blue, green and gray
sometimes i know not what goes on in chats, and this is one of them
Kuuga <3
PUNCHES. Y U NO DO ANYTHING?
0See? No stick, now he's going to get his ass kicked.
GO TITAN KUUGA
Technically all bees dies after stinging. Wasps on the other hand don't
Fail punch
oh wayt
go Pegasus
8is it me or does the blue guy kind of suck at fighting?
Lol, owned.
hi
OH SHIT
nah
green mode
Wtff
9Hipster: Blue is LIGHTNING BRUISER GLASS CANNON
Wtfffff
No its not you the blue does kind of suck at fighting
Blue is faster than red
maybe he's some kind of mutant bee, or something
what's with all his modes lawl
0Only when he doesn't have a stick, he needs a stick to be able to do anything.
but weaker
Green is SUPERSENSES
Oh! I see it now! XD Kamen Rider Kuuga
8suddenly, acid trip
9BRIPPING TALLS LIKE THIS SHIT IS THE GAOHM ZONE
8did he died?
WAT
more like I CAN HEAR EVERYWHERE
suddenly shakey cam
Wtd
I hope Green is the ability to survive high falls
THE END
Yes he died that is the end of the series
0So apparently green form's power is to suck worse than blue.
>implying Coolguy can die
I MAKE A PILLOW OUT OF HEAVY LUGGAGE

It does sound familiar

Scootaloo I URGE you to see DECADE

8lunar, after COOLGUY

8THATS WHAT SHE SAID
9and two Coolguys because you know how Coolguy works
any times over
4dari, what was that?
SirSprinkles: Hahaha.
multiply any times over...
henshin
0dari's playing with themself
Ghosties: I wanted to set F 6:8, which would kick people if they type more than 6 lines in 8 seconds.
0PICTURES
what
I saw a girl
4...can you do that?
i base this on my medical knowledge
4can you do that, dari?
0dari can do ANYTHING
9sorry
Depends on IRCd the network is running.
9I was uploading this
0For non-otaku, henshin translates roughly to transform, hence the reason Kamen Rider shouts it before transforming.
I know for sure it works on unrealIRCd
4but will it work, dari? Will it work for this chat?
hey quany wany chan
9http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9379/skybecomesblue.jpg
._.
8dari, that wont affect mods, will it?
that makes sense
0...are you doubting the chat channel, Ghosties?
ohai Quan
oops
0lulz image DCD
8cuz it might slow down my copy-pasting of the pre-show announcements
4Not at all, Sprinkles, I'm just wondering if he can do that o.o
Hipster_Brony: I can't remember, but you can always set exceptions/protections anyway.
Nice one New DCD
ahah I remember that DCD
0Oo there's somepony in here named not
Awesome Pinkie gives thumbs up to Kuuga!
Thats me
8BUT PONIES DONT HAVE THUMBS, DCD!
/me 0only noticed because Ghosties' text changed color
0Pinkie Pie.
9fun fact: the episode in which they explain the whole "thumbs-up" theme, I cried manly tears
whocare.mp3
4Yeah, I only noticed as well, Sprinkles
9it's a foam thumb, like the foam hand we've seen before
hey nicky chan
8oh, ok
@Hipster_Brony: they don't have hands at all and yet they can pick things up pretty well
somethings we just accept
lol
0...why is it sometimes /me comes up in standard colors, and sometime in beige... Oo
8the pic of rarity holding the piece of paper always gets me
you gotta suspend your disbelief
what are these numbers?
0What numbers?
Well
a bit late I know
/me 4is wondering
On Kamen Rider Kuuga
4It's always remained in red for me, Sprinkles
0Oh, wasn't watching.
/me 0gets beige sometimes
dat crt
/me 0has been getting standard recently
Guess
9I'm Blue, if I were Green I would Die...oh wait
4YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD
0Oh, the numbers are certain Kamen Riders, I think.
Oh
9Unidentified Lifeform classification
13PRETTY PINK
0No clue, I watch ponies for the plot, I watch tokusatsu for the ass kicking. XD
9Kuuga is Unidentified Lifeform No. 4
The numbers are the different monsters
0Oh sorry
9many toku has good plot if you follow it, though
4Haha, Not got the warning. That's awesome
8thats gonna save so much time
9indeed
death in 5...
9DYNAMIC RESCUE
0Yeah, but I tend not to care that much about it, I just want to see him kick people until they explode. :p
oh, nvm
he has a gun
8needs moar motorcycles
0MY EYEBROWS WILL SAVE YOU!
why did he punch it earlier
does this show have any giant robots?
Hmm, it seems that UltimateIRCd (this network runs it) doesn't have the f channel mode, oh well, can always make a script for it.
help, a crazy man with gun kidnapped us!
0Guns don't work on monsters, only exploding kicks work.
"oh, shit, that's right, I have a fun!"
er... gun
choo choo
0Not
0Yes but that's a special uber gun powered by exploding kicks. :p

Nah, i'm pretty sure I spelled Twilight correctly. :P
wow
0 4.6 BILLION
but applejack has an A in it
And Twilight has a T in it.
All i can see is Rarity
usually you see the football field used to show distance between planets not time
not sure what your all talking about
8Last time I checked, Rainbow Dash wasn't spelled "Twilight"
Fluttershy is best pony.
0Silly fillies, that's not how you spell Pinkie Pie.
this show taught me these things before i ever had my first science class...
all ponies are best ponies?
^Agreed
9MAGNA-CAM

Super Sentai, the show that Power Rangers gets their stock footage from.
Sword shooting guns.

0yuritastic
DC kicking the shit out of 100 mooks with a kill counter in the corner = most badass sixth Ranger ever.
This is boring. I liked it more when buildings were being cut in half
not like she can jump ship
lol leap of faith off the ship
^
what does DC stand for?
does anyone care theres a pirate ship above them?
4So this is normal for Japan, for unidentified pirate ships to be floating above the city all the time
Doggy Crueger.
of course he masters it the same day
9HOLY SHIT

Men gotta be men

4Fuck yeah to Person, Sprinkles, and Combustible
Those look about as sharp as a stick

I'm just that cool, Ghosties.
Human Endorsement Procedure
hipster, I don't get it. Help plz?

Why was I not first in that list?

O.O

Better question is why don't the Sentai ever just skip straight to summoning their mecha and step on the monsters while they're small?
Why do they all use the wheel? Only one's needed...
FIRE THE FRIENDSHIP CANNON

They have the powers of every single sentai team
/me 11looked up some pony fanfic. Over half of them ignore pony accents and even more of them ignore proper pony termonaligy (everypony). It was annoying.
Dr_Foreigner they did that in a movie I think

dat kid is a spah
11Clint Eastwood > Chuck Norris. >.>
sorry if this was mentioned before, but this is a remake of the Kurosawa film "Yojimbo"
Colt Eastwood plays The Horse with No Name...
4Silverscreen is absolutely correct
GTFO
too bad most ponies worked in mines
yes please
Clint Eastwood was Clint Eastwood BEFORE Chuck Norris
13Oh lord.
"Yojimbo"..? really?*intrigued*
Tsk. Poor shot.
Shooot her!
<minority
11I prefer to watch the movie rather than read it.
don't shoot the baby
our show's villain, I assume?
lolololololol
Just saw Yojimbo actually.
shooting children? not cool
kick the baby
no! rape D:
11oye
And then Clint Eastwood kicked ass.
4Sudden, piano
Oh, it's on now!
oh no they di-int
I like this guy
9I can't turn them off in this player. I'd have to switch to VCL derp
Also Last Man Standing.
Yojimbo is an awesome movie, I recommend it.
i can't understand these people at all!
11Piano: The instrument of the wets.
4FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

11west*
no
that's better...
got my tacos, ready to watch!
no
Aw. Poor kid.
Clint eastwood always kicks ass
the intro is playing. the actual movie isn't going yet
Not the only western adaptation of a samurai movie. The Magnificent Seven was a remake of the Seven Samurai.
fuck spoons i eat with a ladel
it's probably hardcoded anyway
i neds me some food
11eh, just leave them. We'll live.
I loved maginificent seven
See, I ask and no one answers-

asked what?
0noose
*ding*
4Ask what, Unintelligentgenius?
wtf is going on here?
I prefer Seven Samurai, but I just like samurai better than cowboys in general.
*ding*
Hi
13it makes me sad on how I have NO idea on what any of yall are saying.
Clint and his nooses.

PEANUT!
4Oh

Welcome, stranger. /merchant voice

Fistfull of Dollars
Hoofful of Bits
A gun that shot liquor would never leave my mouth
hey annirun
11A hooffull of Dollars.
It's not smart to have such a bad dub
Wow, at this exact moment the announcements are finally showing to me. This is some serious lag
lol
Intense hat tipping
I think Mibbit's having problems tonight.

4Oh shit, awesome time

So chilled lol

Nice move, Clint.
Clint never runs... his horse, however, is a damned coward.
11The horse ran, not Clint.
classy
quite
Darn parasprite
His horse is Scootaloo's aunt.
man that guy is quite the paraspirite
go away tingle
4Silverscreen, good point. My faith in Clint still remains
My kind! How racist!
Yeah, remember those guys in movies who are manufactured to be assholes - We need more of those
You mean Shia LeBitch?
8ordered pizza, said keep the change, almost added "ya filthy animal"
on the plus side, the coffen maker is making a KILLING
RIP roulette wheel
I am eating icecream, watching clint eastwood, and bronying. I am so effing happy right now.
4LOL Home Alone
NOT THE ROULETTE WHEEL!
nice hipster
Won't someone please think of the roulette wheel!
11Unintelligentgenius: I kinda miss flankholes like that....
wow, this is exactly like yojimbo so far
ok, that's different
...stupid cafe I'm in just HAD to have music night tonight. >>;
and he just shoots thtem all.
widows have dicks
THE WOMEN AREN'T WOMEN!
widows=/=women
It's pretty much a remake of yojimbo.
Dari, how are you doing that?
$5 says someone stupidly casts Shia LeBitch to star in a western.
he must be making plenty of bits
9brb
Clint Eastwood: Sexyiest man alive or SEXIEST man alive?
Dari is the chatroom.
yahhhhh...kinda make me thinks of yojimbo
Dari has all power.
0black type
oh, here we go
haha hipster_brony
he's all old and wrinkly...
That would be beyond ghastly.
It's a REIMAGINING of yojimbo, not a real remake
Okay, now we're good.
The chat was broken for a second there.
Upstairs
Fair enough.
I don't want to be a bother, but is anyone else still getting lag?
Dur
Yojimbo and Sanjuro were both fantastic.
I really have to be more careful.
not me
Applejack vs Eastwood, who will win?
nope
No lag here
11Shia Lebouffe isn't that bad of an actor. Just like Nick Cage, he just needs the right roles to play in.
Actually the guy who made Yojimbo got more from suing this film company than from the original yojimbo.
GTFO of my balcony
12LOL!!!!
12drf
they would both win darf
Eastwood rides Applejack into the sunset
12KFC is donating stuff to you
he hides his pron on that balcony
12http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/epic-fail-photos-diabetes-support-fail.jpg
lol
the chat is in a constant state of broken :(
can't use a gun with hooves
where did his horse go?
hell find the porn!
Bandits and smugglers...
I don't think I can stay long this time. I have graduation soon.
Maybe Applejack and Clint can work together?!
lmfao
And gamers
but they'd become friends
Yeah, and action movies are about as far away from the right roles as you can get for LeBitch.
Rakuren, the chat isn't broken.
and maybe the clopflic he wrote too >.>
11Rakuren: Try refreshing the chat. It lagged for me too until I did.
well if ya hafta leave nick, at least have fun at graduation
I'm not sure of what the right role for Shia is, Silvescreen.
Screw you and the clopfic you rode in on.
i need a picture of clint eastwood riding applejack. Nao
lol
Sure as heck never seen the kid it it.
Baxta!
what have I done
then theres breburn, the apple baron
I'm behind the guys who sell the booze
big gun merchants. No small guns allowed
Outline A little girl? He screams like one.
Dat Baxta bastad!
if a man says there is nothing up there, THERE IS SOMETHING UP THERE
11Outline: Shia is best in the dumbass/expendable comedian sidekick role.
Screw it im downloading mIRC
i wonder who pays for the coffin?
Lag!
not to sound like a philistine but I don't get it
the apple family over there
8i dont see any horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages here

11For some reason, he keeps going into action movies.
4Welcome to the Mild-west

And I require a script

The mule has a poor sense of humor.
Wait now lag is severely diminished
its official ponies apply to everything
JOhn Sappington Marmaduke would love this guy
she really wants one yeah
he named his penis "my mule"
11Clint's talking through his teeth...y'all are fucked.
We don't take too kindly to laughing either in these parts
8YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, DON MIGUEL ROJO!
Third person talking all day!

Problem solved.

*darth vader* apology accepted.
multikill ?
this is why i love westerns
4 in less than 3 seconds
if he would just cut her some slack she'd feel so much better about it I think
Impressive, killing people he wasn't even aiming at.
The coffin maker must be rich as hell.
THAT'S FAST
No don't use that word- they are sleeping - SLEEPING
but that's just me
Baxta!

Clint could clear the whole town in 10 seconds flat
06:3
the best part, dcd
BURY ME WITH MY MONEY! [/SunsetRiders]
13Hmmmmmmmmm
IT NOT TRUE- THEY DID NOT DIE- THEY DID NAOT
4DCD, you missed Clint dealing out a dish of badass
Badass indeed
11Wow, even in the west, politicians are lying, corrupt assholes.
13I'm thinkign Hacks.
8you missed some general badassery
Heya bronies, what did I miss?
Y'know, This wouldn't have the same effect with apple pies. Just sayin'
12!espeon
12:3
100 bits
Well Celestia came out of fucking nowhere and then everyone had tea and biscuits.

Nate, you missed clint eastwood killing four bitches.
9damn my mother and her need for help with groceries
a hoofful of bits first part
and a japanese power rangers
damn, lol
what movie is this?
Four killed in 10 seconds flat
CB
>missed Clint being badass due to helping people on the /oat/ thread... ;_;
He's gonna take on the military
not 10 seconds
Ah, good, because I know who let the dogs out.
2 seconds.
8fistful of dollars, mario
11A hoofful of bits. We need a poster of that. I'll get on it sometime.
minus Clint
oh
Hey sorry, did I miss anything important in the first 15mins?
rainbow dash fell off her cloud because of that
a suit of armor in the west...wjat
Silverscreen: I agree
he's already dead
you do that silverscreen
we'll remember your noble sacrifice sprinkles
Man, he looks so strange without his hat on. Doesn't Clint Eastwood look like a man who was BORN looking old?
OH SNAP
8that would be epic, silver
he just doesn't know it
That just seems out of place.
:P
9not as many bronies today, eh?
With Braeburn as Clint.
best job ever
8braeburn as clint
Looking forward to that Silver :)
its chico teim
13Trying to keep the thread bumped.
hey it's that guy
9I think it's more convenient for us when the movie night notice is posted the same day
It'll jump once we hit the episodes and The Room, DCD
booty spotted.
Braeburn as Clint would be badass.
oh hai live intrest
Get three coffins ready...
4 coffins, lawl
how many bronies are there?
i would be horrified if braeburn was clint...
8i agree dcd
4So it WASN'T a big lipped alligator moment after all
Hipster_Brony Herd mind brohoof! XD
i'm just came to watch The Room today, but i can wait
about 100?
after I sleep with her, I will
bronies lurking
4I'm sure we'll get more people for The Room
The Room is last I think.
13Aye.
13I always lose track of dates and days of the week when I'm not at college
13what day is it tomorrow? :<
8yeah, the room is after ponies
11Damn, I wouldn't have thought of that. But now that you mention it, can do.
It'll be my first time watching the room, actually.
9so guys
A lot of ponies haven't herd of Hooffull of Dollars, so yeah.
9after The Room
4Godddddd, I really wanna play RDR
oh god the room!
Which is funny cause I have it on my harddrive this very moment.
Who's the director for the room if i may be so bold to ask?
Stayin' for the whole thing
9want to fly my wing on Ace Combat online?
...
hooffull of bits sirsprinkles
are we allowed to post links here?
ANYTHING!
haha, law and order.
(law and order: svu)
what does that mean DCD?
Tommy Wiasu
8brony_t, please dont
9you'll see
it's funny how most bronies showed up to watch the BAD movie
k
13Fistfull of Dollars - Winter Wrap Up - Suited for Success - The Room
4Brony_T: no
8not video links anyway
4Not in this chat room
just checking
probably spelling his name wrong
Also, it's still only about 4 here in the west. So some of us are still kinda busy
8pics are fine
yeah we come for the talk really
06saturday. Or well, today for me now :P
and this is an awesome movie
Im here for the room....and ponies
4Just don't spam pics
just curious
Thank ya Unintelligent =)
Why is The Room the laast?
13BECAUSE IT IS!
its the best! :P
I made a "Guile's theme" Room edition was the reason
Yeah, I'm basically in the same predicament. Well, other than being halfway into college.
djdexcat56 where you from? West Coast Canada, same time for me.
Lineup was randomized, IIRC
I wish this movie would just end and they'd start the MLP.
Because everypony would leave after the Room and ponies. :p
FLUTE AGAIN
13Today for me too, but I tend not to consider it "tomorrow" until I've gone to sleep and woken up xD
I came for The Room- Stayed for the ponies
4Indeed, lineup was randomized
11CLINT IS SPY!
I know more than I should for not being a mod. XD
Are you a spy!?
That clint is a spah
CLINT WHY Y U NO SMART?
it's hard these days
Clint is the most awesome gunslinger ever.
I only came for Eastwood. Skipping The Room prolly
Acting
Oh damn what a shame I missed all that
@filly if you wanna watch MLP- watch MLP
everyone's looking for work and hardly anywhere is hiring
why is he not being hung like the sheriff said?
Lol
lol
Pft, Roland is better.
Haha, exactly.
Roland is the best bro.
What am I listening to?
I said I wouldn't stay for the whole show...but what the hell. I'm in for the whole ride.
8turnibrony, you cant skip the room
11I just realized we aren't even referring to him by his character. He's just Clint.
its the ponie train!
I think DCD just delivered one of the oddest pick-up lines ever.
8its ridiculous
4Yep, he's Clint
I came for the brony excitment.
well he's the man with no name
he has no name
He has a character?
well, he doesn't really have a name
4or John Marston. That works too
Everyone HAS to watch the ROOM
I concur
I can skip the room and watch something interesting.
I can't wait for The Room!
Is "The Room" a good film?
And nopony can stop me!
It's legally binding
no
Never even heard of it.
no it is not
4Outline: Yes
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
The room is so bad it's good
8the room is the worst movie ever made
IT's so bad it's good
The Room is a hilarious film. You won't regret it
it's a fantastic film
The Room is terrible. So terrible that it's brilliant
8you will laugh the entire time
its in no way, shape or form a good movie
Security's asleep. Investigate stagecoach!
it's one of the worst
11And that's why we're watching it.
The Room is genious
the room is hilariously bad
It's worse than Moanos?
It's like Plan 9 from Outerspace
Damned Compound
@Hipster: I know ONE worse
4What Unintelligentgenius said
Evil Dead 2 was pure brilliance, that'll be hard to beat.
vamos means yankee?
lol
*Compound Interest Paradox
I was dissapointed actually.
the room is so amazingly funny
The Room is so stupid its genius
mistranslation
Ah
You'll tear us apart if you don't watch it
Oh Hai Room conversation!
The Room gives me a excuse to drink this wisky
Heh, one of those... fair enough.
The room is amazing and yet abysmal at the same time
I was hoping for a more creative B pick.
Maybe cause it's DAY ouitside
Anyway, how's your sex life?
I've never actually seen The Room. I'm... cautiously optimistic.
I was confused what you meant by "compound" :P
11Damn, Dari. Your text stands out the most.
Ed Woods called, he wants to give Tommy Wiseau his Worst Director Ever crown.
pointless scenes like buying roses
I think the Cube could be a good movie
good stuff
I DID NOT HIT HER I DID NOT
4Silverscreen: that's because dari is the chatroom
The Tommyisms are brilliant.
cube was awesome
Yeah...The Room is honestly a bit of a predictable choice.
8o hai mark
OHAIMARK
oh hi mark
What Ghosties says.
Room > Star Wars H.S.
@sirsprinkles we aren't suicidal
11Raindrop: you did it wrong.
i'm marc
For some reason I always seem to hit some key other than Enter that makes me post before I'm done writing.
what's the running time on this?
lol
trust me
You seem like the EGG spurt
11I did Naught*
all of my IRC clients just hate me so much right now.
The shop scene is fucking gold
9 01:43 hours
I've seen it.
8somepony had to pick the room eventually
not offical
i heard it was lost and gone forever
It's... *shudder*
I DID NEIGH!
13>mfw I want to choose DBZ Evolution for the B movie
I always hit the enter key accidentaly
8it was inevitable
we need to get the Cube on the next movie night
Guys should stop talking about The Room so everypony who has not watched it can enjoy it to the fullest.
i vote G1 pony movie
Torrents are your friend.
11GabeMoist: That never happened.
Would it even be possible to get a copy streaming?
or often I do this\]'/
9BronyPeanut that's just cruel
11Bronypenut: that never happened.
I was surprised to see Fistfull of Dollars though. So, there is that atleast.
13xD
8agreed, no more spoilers about the room
Hey, would Transformers, the Animated Film be a B movie or not? Cause I'm wondering.
weird how there are so many great choices for the b movie
movie ideas
hmm
were it my way, the good movie would be castle in the sky by studio ghibli
The Last Airbender as B movie?
I watched it once
god no!
It was meh
nah
9The Last Airbender is a -Z movie
What about Manos: The Hands of Fate?
the last airbender SUCKS
Never saw it, never want to.
13The Village.
way too bad
Last Airbender, lol!
XD DCD
I'm gonna go eat a bit, it seems like a calm part of the movie. I'll be back soooooon.
Ali G in da house for A movie
11SirSprinkles: I will stab you if you ever suggest that movie for this.
test
Don't make me live through that
bad movie does not equal B movie
Ouch Sprinkles. There's bad, and then there's THAT.
If we're going to watch DPS Evolution we should just watch the Mario Bros movie. Same idea but better
the village was just bad, not even funny
I liked the Village UNTIL the big twist.
9Manos: We should watch it as the MST3K episode
last airbender is a F------ to me
Dumbest twist evar!
g1 ponies? last airbender? Nope
I was clearly kidding. We talked about this last week, remember?
There aren't enough letters in the alphabet to describe the Last Airbender.
we watch its so bad its good movies
Maybe with rifftrax?
YES LAST Airbender- I hear it's so terrible, but I have a tough time getting past 5 mins
like troll 2
11MST3K would be good to watch sometime.
SHit's gonna go down.
hold on are you guys implying that Evil Dead 2 was bad?
well, my dinner is ready
Prince of Persia film was a let down. Especially since the games were so good.
Manos. Last Airbender... Troll 2.
so brb
freddie got fingered
Come on guys.
Alrighty.
how about Birdemic
One day I will get you people to watch the live action Casshern movie.
9that said
4Prince of Persia wasn't...terrible
Evil Dead was so bad that it was fucking amazing.
What was the IRC name again? I'm just failing so much right now.
i couldnt watch last airbender
Be more creative
Ghosties: Still, it wasn't as good as I expected.
0bastards
BIRDEMIC
did you really expect a good video game movie?
9Isaac-Shark streams Fridays too and I think he streams MST3K
8suddenly, murder
0U-S-A
We should watch Postal
0U-S-A
Maybe some bronies are hard of hearing.
0:(
suddenly gunshots
11*I* couldn't get past the first ten minutes. And I'm a die hard fan of Airbender who chanced watching all of the DBZ movie.
Lol, everyone dies BUT the horses.
9I should ask him if he'd like to stream for this channel
last airbender is terrible indeed and i like the avatar series
phantom bullets
I was hoping there could be an all animated BMN some time with Iron Giant, Brave Little Toaster, maybe some pixar.
last airbender is to the avatar show what previous gen ponies are to current ones
Needs more killing

Hax!
YES. Iron Giant would be so much win.

I loved DBZ and I refused to watch that...

That machine gun has like no overheating or anything does it.
last airbender was ass he shouldn't have given it away that this was gonna be a trilogy from the begginning of the movie

Hitscan weapons are so OP.
Advent Children Complete was pretty good.
AIM ASSIST! HAX! HAX!!
No ponies were harmed in the making of this movie.

9DAT ACCURANCY
who wants to watch GIDORHA?
WHO TOUCHED MY GUN?!
Rubio is a ballin name
Looks like chat is working right again.

Since they stole the gun from the yanks, they can probably afford it :-p
No survivors
i wanna bet >9000
what's Gidorha?
mib_47shug: Fistful of Dollars
4Ramon is the primary antagonist, I presume?
the three headed dragon from godzilla
Yes.
Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster
Ramon's just a dick.
either this movie is hard to follow or I'm just distracted by the chat
King Gidorha, three headed lightning breathing, flying hydra that gets the shit kicked out of it by Godzilla.
thanks
I think it's the chat.
It's 1:28 am. I feel like derp...

Muffin was delicious! Miss something? Meh, nevermind

8Fun fact: this week's pony episodes feature the 2 best songs in the series
This requires muffins!
...wow he reloaded fast.
ikr?
11Anypony else derp their eyes when eating a muffin nowadays?
this popcorn talk is making me hungry
and thats why you use the fronteir justice
I agree with Hipster_Brony
Ah there we go.

First time here, man this chat likes to lag for me
Dual screen is twice as nice

The night of the triffids - evil Fluttertrees everywhere.
this film shows us the dark side of Appleoosa

THAT was a bang!
Baxters can't shoot to safe their lives. Literally.

@Silverscreen How dare you, HOW DARE YOU?
I thought winter wrap up wasn't a very good episode, but that's just me.
HAHAHA
Lawl
Indeed. i sing winter wrap up all the time and everyone tells me to shut up.
dead men cant talk, lololololol
but i also love the cute mark crusaders song

Winter Wrap Up is brilliant
11How dare YOU! *PhoenixWrightPoint*

Art of the dress was better.

0Either way Daniel Ingram is a genious
WInter Wrap Up and Art Of The Dress are the two songs that stuck to me the most
winter wrap up is the besterest. FACT

/me 11will, if he gets chosen, promot a CMC episode just to be cruel. http://static.tumblr.com/noiu98j/gUplb4j88/trollface.jpg
rape!
@parasprite agreed
easier to list the songs you don't like
0i like the one Daniel Ingram made.. i win
13Equestria Girls has gotten my soul though.
Rape is imminent
8Just for reference:
Maybe- one or two
He doesnt like women
0I'm getting there, I've learned most of them on guitar
13SO MUCH OF THAT ON LOOP
8CUPCAKES REFERENCES DURING ART OF THE DRESS ARE BANNED
Real men punch out everyone. Including women.
Aw well.
I like both Art of the Dress and Winter Wrap up. Honestly, Art of the Dress is my favourite episode, winter wrap up is after.
fixin mah rollerblades right now erectin' a new set a wheels
For the record, Equestria Girls is best song, shout out to bronies for the win!
plus it has a song with a 20 person choire
Sorry but the only good episodes are Green isnt your color, Suited for Success, Look before you Sleep, and a Dog and pony show
lol
non elektro flutter got me
The parade is running late.
Equestria Girls =win
wonder why no[onys mentioned at the gala,....
RUN CLINT
watch it it's extreme win
8ACTUALLY, CUPCAKES REFERENCES ARE ALWAYS BANNED
WE're kinda magical, boots on hooves- bikinis on top
RUN YOU SAP
13Equestria Girls is the best song
Lets just all be honest, Rarity is the best pony
13Ever.
I'm so glad I haven't read cupcakes.
13Oh god
anon clearly likes Rarity
ohGod. Not cupcakes.
ah thank god hipster
I don't want to have ponies ruined for me
I can watch anything that has at least a little to do with ponies, honestly. So I actually enjoy equestria girls :]
I'm kinda torn between At the Gala and Winter Wrap Up, tbh
8beard: nope.avi
11Hipster: Not banned, just don't spam them.
cupcakes? I don't get it
Well what's the general consensus on the worst episode?
Cupcakes is the funniest thing I've ever read.
shh...
The TV Tropes page alone made me sick to my stomach.
The puns were great. XD
you know what, they're all good songs anyways
I can't bring myself to listen to equestria girls all the way through
You dont want to get it elky
equestria girls combines two things i love looking at
13NEXT TIME I HEAR CUPCAKES IMMA DO SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NO IDEA
its MLP, there is no worst episode
I kid, I kid
elky its a grimdark fanfic
whats his name in this clints
There's a trope page for Cupcakes?
11I read Cupcakes. The gramical errors annoyed the hell out of me
Yes.
8CUPCAKES IS AWFUL, IN MORE THAN ONE WAY
13FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFfff
Nightpony: darn straight
hun? whats so bad about cupca....oh THAT cupcakes.
really?
how do you hide horse meat in a cupcake anyway?
I never liked the dog and pony show episode, myself.
Silverscreen: Oh, you should ahve read the updated version then.
Eh, Grimdark. Is it so hard to write in a style that makes sense for the series?
That's the "worst" for me.
there's only not quite as awesome as the others episodes
silverscreen, there's a revised version
>still hasn't read cupcakes
I will never read it, it will scar me for life.
Well horse meat is actually quite sweet.
way to go clint, you killed her
Achievement Unlocked: Sleeping Women can't say no
I imagained cupcakes as two bad actors with really bad costumes. Like this: 'saw saw' 'ouch.'
the owl episode was a pretty low point, imo
if you do read it, then read the ending about the movie it's actually funny
13Ok. Stop mentioning cupcakes before I pull out.. the uh. Fuck I dunno. Just stop.
the ending :
CAN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT CUPCAKES?
talking about cupcakes again? barely had an impact on me actually
she'll sleep? Wow
amaing
stop bring up that fanfic of pasteries!
and this is how you turn any chat into a cupcakes discussion
Alright Hipster_Brony Time for a duel to decide the best pony. 10 paces, and fire
11nah. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it was. Too fast moving to really do anything.
Cupcakes was honestly the first thing I read on the internet where I get the feeling that I wan't to throw up but can't
no cupcakes allowed. only muffins
Let's talk about MUUUFFIIINS
Muuuufins
dog and pony show is great...but my bro didn't like it, it was his first ep too. should of shown him ticket master
0No more cupcakes for goodness sake, I was talking about her song...
...and then i said, oatmeal?! Are you crazy!?
This chat is now about classy ponies. Deal with it.
such is the way of our lord and savior Derpy
MUFFINS ONLY.
Dont read it, for the love of all insanity don't read it!
Muffins are infinitely superior.
*Wing boners*
ding
0Muffins
anypony play pacderpy?
8RAINBOW DASH, BEARD, IT ISNT CLOSE EITHER
This time pony i'll be
Soooo... how about french cuisine?
9MORE DOLLARS
Muffing Proof
Yay! People appreciate my fanfic!
Rainbow Dash is my saviour

http://www.halolz.com/2011/06/03/show-me-ya-hooves/
praised be rainbow dash
This chat needs to eb about 20% cooler
11More Bits!
plus the ponies are all vegetarian, wouldn't horse meat make them all ill?
4EVERYPONY IS BEST PONY, THERE
holler holler
what was that money for i dont get it
everypony ...
Dog and pony show WOULD have been fine for me if the dogs' voice actors didn't go to such effort to make them SO ANNOYING
WHAT AN AFFRONT TO PONYDOM! *Readies gun*
13Unless it's Rarity.
that story makes me cry *crying madly*
Now he can buy a new poncho
HAHAHAHA, THats their bell? hahahaha
'Erry day Clint be husslin'
sigh all of a sudden i can't view the video im getting a missing plugin error sweeeet
muffin proof WAS CREDIT TO BRONY TEAM!
what Bronypeanut said.
13Rarity is ahead of everypony by a small bit
Bellringer's earning his keep there....
THIS IS WHINIIIIING
13<3
rarity is annoying though
/me is quite annoyed by all the arguing
:/
8peanut: nope.avi
*Brohoof with Bronypeanut*
+m
that flute again
4Oh shit, Clint's making that noise again
Scootaloo is my favourite pony.
i love all ponies, but pinkie more
what arguing did i miss it
is the server here irchighway.net?
4He's getting ready to fuck someone up
yes
invisible cigarette
Scallywag: Getitng them the girl Ramon wants and thus being able to negotiate rather than having to leave the town overnight?
11irc.irchighway.not
It's his warning alarm
Bronypeanut: Nevermind, then.
Proximity to awesome
mfw rarity literally solves her problems with whining
I gotte learn how to whistle like that
Clint will show us games to play.
Lol, .not
"Rarity" that a strange way to spell Pinkie Pie
:3
COME GET SOME!
Sweeite belle is my facourite CMC
its not, then don't think that's a fungus .
what is going on here
Pinkie Pie first, Scootaloo after. Those are my favourite ponies.
a sweetie belle going'shut up
13Nothing

Good on ya Bronypeanut *wink*
MOD BATTLE GO
13Don't worry.

11Bronypeanut, please don't kick other mods.
Like "Who can absorv the most bullets

silly goose, that's not how you spell fluttershy!
13Okay
blend it in with the ingredients
13.jpg
my favourite mane cast pony?
/me spell
That's the best bell ring I've ever heard
Fluttershy=best pony. new topic
11shitjustgotreal.avi
either fluttershy or rainbow dash
the match begins in TEN SECONDS
Orion is the best pony
4Okay, who the hell is the woman again?
Applejack first, Twilight second.
ah crap its the kid again
Brohoof to Starpony for truth.
>Implying Rarity isn't the best pony ever
It's not a woman, it's a kid.
Who is your favourite character thats not one of the main 6?
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINING!
13Ohai Hipster
the main characters
13Ilu
lol
I want to see her too!
Ah, much better
A-Jack rocks
jesus, the kids name is jesus?
"come back jesus"
because your eyes are closed?
if you had to choose between saving fluttershy or rainbow dash from certain death who would you save
*brohoof*
that kid was dubbed
Fluttershy is best, I agree
WHINING! IRC ajax
whaaaaaaaaaaawhaaaaaaaa cry some moar!
pronounced hay-soos
just wait 2000 years
11the j is pronouned as an "H"
....spike is the best charector overall
Everyone who wasn't Clint was dubbed
So I'm just here for the chat now no video wo
I'd save Fluttershy because RBD could save herself AND kikc ass
sorry rainbow dash, fluttershy can't die D:
fun fact, the kid's name in the italian version is not jesus
My order from best-worst: Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie, Applejack, Twilight, Rarity
EVERYPONY IS AS GOOD AS EACH OTHER NUFF SAID.
I'd keep the get out of death free card for myself
fluttershy, rainbow dash is awesome enough to save herself
Rarity is a deep charcter
He looks ASIAN!
shaddup
11Like I said: Fucking mexican "J", how does it work?
shaddup
tell that kid to stop whining
Seems like we need ot have a talk Senokai...
THIIS IS WHINIIING
Oh god. Is that kid still alive?
RD can save herself. Fluttershy can stare till she ins.
agree with you guys
Why do people deny Rarity is best pony?
Owlicious is best, no arguing.
Jesus?
mama! jesus!?
MAMA!
Oh god SHUT UP, KID.
Rarity > Twilight > The rest
(something about ponies)
13I don't know man. I do not know.
(something about ponies)
I'd save Luna because powerful mares are hot. :p
Silly anons thats not how you spell Pinkie Pie
(something about ponies)
DAMN KID
NO YOU WILL BOTH DIE
His name is Jesus? Can he walk on water?
nah this is how it is for me
for something with foundation ?
>DRAMA
(death threat)
that guy before pronounced it differently
Errbody loves them some Fluttershy
(death threat)
hey zeus
flute
stone faced
kill the humens
I don't get this scene
shot the kid
(something about ponies)
-shot-
dat flute
Or not >>
4 >seriously expected someone to be shot in that scene
Rarity>Rarity>Rarity>Twilight Sparkle
same
11....I think I missed something.
Anyways. As for side ponies, I wish they'd do more Zecora.
Fluttershy/Rainbowdash, pinkie pie, twilight, rarity, applejack
I liked her
#BronyState #BronyState flute #BronyState flute >seriously <Raider310>
no idea what's going on
Look at Jeusu there Rarity... THAT'S how you do whining.
............Is this even legal?
Don't be a fool Marshall. Nopony's getting shot now.
in order of mst liked
Owlicious > 9000 > Rarity
go see drawfriend 95 on equestria daily the first saucy pic is gold
HA
i bet if the ponies were in this movie, they'd kick everyones ass
is this chat occupied when it's not movie night?
bitchslap!
Why does everyone like Luna so much it pisses me off
Master_Beard2: Rarity and Twilight are on teh same spectrum for me, but I don't like either of them.
whoops
Twilight>The other five
ouch
lemons, that's literally my reversed order
colts are in this movie at least
in order to keep zecora looking pony
*Sheds a tear for Senokai's Choice*
Big brother instincts, I'm required to like Luna.
I make to pony list
4Glass_Arm, stop spamming plox
I love them all
RD/fluttershy>pinkie pie>twilight>rarity>applejack.
my desktop ponies, plox
9BADASSERY'S BUILDING UP
pinkie>rainbow dash>fluttershy>rarity>twilight sparkle>applejack
Glass_Arm, this is your last warning
11Glass Arm, no colored text
Im still gonna tolerate and love the shit outta you senokai
m looking for tornado warning
Yeah go bar guy!
Love and tolerance bronies, nopony is the best. (except Luna)
brb
scratch is like Beat from jsrf just cause of the glasses
lol
I have had to warn you for colored text, spamming and post links now
*Doesn't care for Master_Beard2's tear*
It's not that I don't like Luna it's just that she's in demand so much more than everypony else
hipster, you might want to turn yellow text back on
13*says something witty to glass_arm cause everypony else is going it*
rainbow dash > twilight > rarity)
11...Is clint going to hafta shoot a bitch?
>Implying Luna has a character
Best ponies in order: Braeburn > Appajak > Whatever who cares
That was a notice BTW, not coloured text.
Why does this favorite pony discussion need to turn into e-drama?
8good call elky
everypony is best on different levels
Fluttershy>RD>TS>PP>AJ>rarity
Oh my... Fluttershy vs. Luna in a no-holds-barred Cute-off...
/me <mariomarc> <mariomarc> <mariomarc> shelf. Errbody Errbody Errbody
where is the drama i dun see it
because it's srsbzns
deer gawd
Fluttershy would win
were just talkin
luna gets like 5 seconds of screentime in the entire series and she's the most liked background character
.......well THAT was rather anti-climactic
i love this pony storm
OhboyClintEastwood
ic what u did thar deer! hahahahahahaha
That's what im sayin combustible
everypony is best the pony.
13lol
0Everypony is equal in my eyes, but Fluttershy is more equal than the others.
though i do love luna too
DERPY WINS, NEW TOPIC
The entire budget of the film went to buy poncos and cigars for Eastwood.
/me 11brohoofs Hipster for doubleteam
I can't wait for the drama when season 2 Luna is NOT like fanonluna ^^
13Rarity. Nuff said.
need budget when you mute, right ?
watching clint eastwood, talk about MLP
Who cares about ponies, Owlicious is best....
Its her story, and what she represents that makes me like her
eats wood!
how about predictions for Season 2?
Money well spent Turni
Dr. Whoof is best because he could abort the mane 6 from time.
No way Gummy dude
8we make a good team, silver
Luna has emo hair. And have you been to /chat/? That's why she's popular.
Shouldn't a Clint Eastwood movie have more ass kicking than this?
Luna is cute ill admit ^_^
PLOT TIME
Rezo: That is going to be amazing.
is 100% amazing
Season 2: No more CMC, Nuff said
Indeed. Money well spent.
This is a completely non-troll question, but would it be fair to say that all furries are bronies, but not all bronies are furries?
13Season 2 will have the CMC
agreed
Master_Beard2 you disappoint me
who's your least favourite character then, including background characters
13They still don't have their Cutie Marks.
back
8pone-zone
uh no (Gabe Newell)
wasn't there a comic on that pone zone?
uh, no?
8i would say no
maybe
I'm so lost with this movie
I love the CMC
probably spike for me
W...what makes all furries bronies?
Zone: nope
8not very furry knows about ponies
I'm sure there are at least some non-brony furries.
Season 2 introduces Megan the human friend of the ponies, im calling it RIGHT NOW
owlwlicious can take his place.
Sorry but each time i see the CMC and have them Herp and Derp, i die a little
I think the CMC will still e there, but one will get their mark
I'd rather not get into that discussion. Have you seen the furry hatred on EqD?
a furry it can be pony work !
not every furry likes this show
0I gotta take off have fun everyone
11...that sound affect came late.
Dumb logic on my part then
lol
how many times is he gonna drink from that empty glasS? XD
We need to have a movie with clint eastwood, chuck norris, and ponies
was that a cat on the spit?
furries and bronies are two different things
the plot isn't even complex, how can you be lost?
Working freelance has it's atvantages.
i know a furry who isn't a brony
no, P0ne-Zone, because a furry doesnt have to like MLP
In season 2 derpy will be a regular character
I think it's ironic that people who go on about "love and tolerance" are rather hateful towards furries
11Do NOT start the Furries discussion, please.
IN TEH DICK
P0ne-Zone	This is a completely non-troll question, but would it be fair to say that all furries are bronies, but not all bronies are furries? <--- No. I know a couple furries who detest MLP.
ok
On a serious and Sappy note, I have to say that this is quite fun
8YOU DONT SHOOT PEOPLE IN THE DICK!
13Agreed with Silver.
11NO FURRIES DISCUSSION.
"drink up" ok
We need to watch Boondock Saints, Boss Nigger, and Blazing Saddles one night.
Spread sucks man.
medival times= old mares tale
thanks silver
Im both, but Im usually the exception
11We don't need longwinded debates here.
Not all furries are bronies
I'm surprised my computer hasn't crashed - It's been like 5 minutes since it has
everypony that hates mlp has never seen it
9DAT HEART
wait a goddamn second
*is furry* let's not talk about them
someone has anger issues
ooh, a heart
I have some friends who havent even heard of the show
Oh crud a flame war *put on flame proof vest*
aw now tinman has a heart
oh hai der
Silverscreen Help help! I'm being repressed! :p
who is iit
4that's what you think Ramon
8guys, please stop discussion of furries
11Yes, please.
13^Agreed.
8its only going to end in rage
As the ancient Mexicans said
4Keep everything civil everybody
CowboyTJ: Not true.
I still think we're mature enough to have this discussion.
11Ohhh...winchester vs. .45
THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THAT ARMOR IT WAS ALREADY FULL OF HOLES
shouldn't you aim for the head?
I think we're being civil
11Both very nice guns.
No, we're bronies. Everyone is welcome
Whats going to end in rage is the optometrist bill for when I have to get glasses from reading yellow text on a white background.
Think Gilda will come back in season 2?
It doesnt matter about maturity, What the mods say, is what goes
Dr_Foreigner, new armor
naw
Buritos > Nachos?
All four mods(?) say so, then it must be serious.
I know taht
8it starts out civil, but it never ends that way
HAHAHAHAHAH
That said, Bronies are pleasantly protective about their love of MLP, considering that almost every cupcake alternate ending tries to retcon it
trixie might
I hope not
SomePerson: nup.
I doubt it SomePerson
yeah with her awesome slouch
i want TRIXIE back
AHHH HAHAH HA HA HA WARIO!
Bronies are good people
winston: we have black bg here
Obey the mods or get hit by the ban hammer
Listen to your Kings
I don't
WAAARIO, HAHAHA
hahaha
9CLINT SMASHWOOD
I dont
Trixie>Gilda
I think the CMC will still be there, but one will get their mark
9IS SMASHED
Trixie maybe, but sadly Gilda seems like a one-shot.
screw the ban hammer, try the ban anvil
Clint Eastwood is about to get raped.
4DCD: *brohoof*
he let himself get drunk?!
sadly that is dirty .
11It's been stated that some of the antagonists will return in Season 2.
the ban piano
4That was pretty good
I can stand Trixie more than Gilda...only slightly though
troll
I made an image of rainbow dash wearing a trixie pelt to show my hatred to her
8DAT FLUTE
better be trixie
dat flute
Trixie is so much >Glida
If only 1 of the CMC gets their marks, thats gonna be pretty bad for the other 2
Cursed chat, I have no idea why they're having a good time.
trixie will return
4 >Clint opens his eyes, flue plays
herd mind
oh. faking it. of course.
<3 Dat Flute.
clints plot detector, it makes a flute noise
4 >Clint does ANYTHING, flute plays
Trixie and Gilda should team up
where is that flute coming from
fluuute
Clint Trollwood
I kind of like trixie, if only for the neighsayer line
or something..
Gilda was mean to Fluttershy -> Barred from the show FOREVER
>Clint plays flute
dat flute
NICE CALL GHOSTIES
4Clint Flutewood everybody
gilda was sent
When the flute plays, you die.
i agree outline
TO THE MOOOOON!
I've given up on trying to figure this out
hey there
flutes, flutes everywhere
I hope we see Evil Overlady Fluttershy finally enact the final stage of her master plan to overthrow Trollestia.
I liked both Gilda and trixie as antagonists
11It's official, Clint has a flute either stuck up his ass or loged in his throat.
NEEIIIGH SAYERS
you MUST DIE
you know
make fluttershy cry, you die.
I hope they both return
8when you hear the flute... run
They just don't make films like that anymore ;_;
you dont die when someone plays the flu *urk*
clint flutewood?
I love how theres a stream going on but the channel topic doesnt include a link to it
the mount moves include rainbow tornado, super speed kick to the end .
flute flutewood?
Do you think we'll ever have a Derpy episode? Or will she always just be that background pony that everybody loves?
9This is pretty easy to understand
flute fluteflute
its the flute from the carussel botique ^^
Huh, I wonder why it didn't accept docbeard.
Hypothesis: Clint smokes custom-made flute cigars
Derpy gets a speaking role in season 2 I hear
damn time zones...
13Derpy is becoming Canon Curb
Derpy will always be background
Derpy is supposed to become a secondary character
you dare bring a flute to mah brony lair? U mustDDDDDDDIIIIIIEEEE!
flute
papa, why?
curbpony: If we don't, I will dislike Lauren Faust a little bit.
an episode about derpy would ruin her
because I cant not love here.
lauren flute
wow
because he is the main character stupid kid
I had a dream where Pinkie Pie comes in with derp and says "Hey guys this is my cousin, Derpy Hooves!" What does this mean?
Derpy will be background cannon
Derpy has to stay background, imo
they are now planning her background appearances
we won't get a derpy episode, it was already stated she'll continue being a cameo character
nothing ruins anything
That kid is pissin me off!
I kind of hope she remains a background pony but kind of hope she gets a canon personality too.
go to bed JESUS
I like have no idea what the kid has to do with anything
except people complaining
an ester egg, nothing more
this chat is now derpy
CowboyTJ quite possibly...
what movie
11That kid isn't so bad.
Derpy is becoming a character
It's 1:00 am here

Old Clint is hot too, just for different reasons.

It taught me that magic is real!
My Little Pony taught me that cakebeards are the key to world peace.
MLP also teaches us how to make Baked Bads
They're all bad guys
it taught me about plot!
DAS FLUUUUTE
No, he killed the bad guys so they'll fight the other bad guys.

Friendship is the magic that turns dreams into reality.

Peanut, you learned to much about ponies

8I think Clint Eastwoods a pretty cool guy. Eh kills people with machetes and doesn't afraid of anything
11Huffy.
I will always have to duck when i hear flutes now
9Friendship! Become Magic Itself!
11Stop the spam.
you need to unlearn some pony stuff
I really need to watch the rest of Episode 1.
maybe it's an ocorina and not a flute. maybe clint is link
Clint Easthoof.
hufy, I can't decipher your code
I have a question
MLP taught me the value of getting Lauren Faust to produce a girl's show
Link Eastwood.
HORSE CHASES, THE EQUIVILENT OF CAR CHASES
MLP taught me that it's okay to like girly things
wat do`
No thats terrible ponyname
I want to play that game. Like, right now.
he did smash all the pots in the house
13I don't think I have to delearn anything about ponies.
Any good pony drawer who could draw a Clint Eastwood pony?
scratch fool!
Colt Easthoof
Colt Easthoof?
shoot
13I THINK I NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT PONIES
dat horsies
;)
4Clint Eastwood is Braeburn in "My Little Pony: Bullets Are Magic"
I should totally do a clint eastwood pony.
Theres that flute again
Silver, I can barely tell your text apart from the white. Why are you using that color blue?
rofl
I think you need to learn when too much pony is too much
MLP taught me about Brony Movie Night.
lol, Ghosties
I like the little chorus of guys going "Aaaah!"
a little
@ghosties genius
so what would he ride if he was a pony?
the fuck does "Failed to logon as '' reason: [ authentication failed]" mean
himself
wouldn'T work
Trombe.
Elky: Buffalo.
this lawbreaker thinks he can take the backroads, but the officers dont let him out of their sights
Chico!
8A HOOFFUL OF BITS, STARRING BRAEBURN
/me 12will be making a Hoofful of Bits poster with Braeburn as Clint.
BAKED BADS RECIPIE: x1 bag of chips, soda, x3 juiced lemons and worms.
13There can never be too much pony.
MLP has actually changed my outlook on things. I think I'm nicer in general now. I assume that everyone has a good reason for doing the things they do that might annoy me.
MLP taught me that I have an unhealthy addiction to MLP
4Thanks everypony
8SOMEPONY GET ON THIS
flute=my ringtone
9Trombe! Trombe! Hashireee!!

I demand that "Bullets are Magic" is made right now
it's true Bullets are magic
Oooohohoho
lol they like Luna's night
It needs more Chico: NO EXCEPTIONS!
It means you failed to login as null.
and how long must I feel pain in wisdom teeth removal?
MLP taught me that a children's tv show can make a bunch of game makers, music makers, artists, and authors appear out of nowhere
i want a Tommy Wiseau pony
That sounds awesome, Silverscreen.
someone needs to be ?
+1 for Hipster_Brony's suggestion
I'd do bullets is magic but I wont/.
But that is wrong Peanut
That's so much better, can tell you're a mod as soon as you post now.
Shouldn't it be a Hoofful of Apples? :p
So so wrong

It'd be like having a Sesame Street Fanfic with lust and betrayal and tragedy.

falcon..........u know the rest
we vote blazing sadles
P0ne-Zone: Fics like that do exist, though.
and after I went to hell, and got laughing gas
Yknow, considering the sheer amount of people he has killed, why not just SHOOT HIM.
blazing saddles but with every instance of the n-word replaced with "pony"
i dont vote blazing saddles :[
12Blazing Saddles would make a good A movie some other time.
"You are behaving like Applejack!"
it went like this
EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE
BLAZING PONIES
electrons replaced with a scarf
It is a movie that could never be made today
EHEHEHEHEHE

4So THAT'S why Clint was tapping those barrels earlier
EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE
8BARREL OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
lol!!!
Whoopsies!
Donkey Kong out of nowhere

Clint Barrel
12Du du du du-du-du-du

They fail to jump over the barrel and lost a life!
CLINT THINKS HE IS A BARREL.
This just became the terminator, 1850
do a barrel roll!
How does Clint forsee his future?
future
do a barrel roll!
"See, this right here is why I did Any Which Way But Loose."
or take the hammer
Don't you forget Mexicolt
9DEATH BY BARREL
WHT WAS THAT BARREL FOR!!
clint is whatever he wants to be
PRESS R OR Z TWICE
Press z or R twice
"Always smart to have an ape owe you a solid."
The video lagged for me then, so I just saw a picture of barrel, then a pic of him screaming, then Clint
Embrace your inner barrel Clint!
12They didn't jump in time.
was that barrel full of antimatter?
Those guys had strawberry jam all over their faces!
It's Clint Fucking Eastwood.
aparantly barrals do a lot of damage
space jam
*insert barrel joke here*
What makes you think he CAN'T foresee the future?
no space jam
4Go Clint!
13Barrels are just super effective.
I always loved this scene, especially since it was pretty well foreshadowed early in the movie by showing the big barrel
Man do you know how heavy a barrel full of water is?
*plays sad mgs music*
pretty damn heavy
lol he looks like spike seigel beat up
they're just NOW worrying about the noise? XD
4Dr_Foreigner: Yeah, that was pretty good
we should BLAZING SADDLES next week
it sounded like a large barrell
Clearly the noise was a yell and a crash
What a thriiiiil
12Like I said, he takes a beating, then kicks more ass.
my D&D games don't have enough barrels
Can we get a plot recap for those of us joining late?
The darkness, and silence through the niiiight
Why isn't this in the Criterion Collection?
What a thriiiiil.
+1 vote for Blazing Saddles
Cody_MacArthur_Fett: Clint eastwood kicks ass and takes names.
clint eastwood does awesome things
Watch him close the door
Bad people are bad, Clint is going to shoot them.
that's all you need to know
Clearly blazing saddles will be the next video :D
Recap: People want to kill Clint Eastwood. This will not end well for the,

Clean them with fire!

Spitfire helped
4CLINT FLUTEWOOD STRIKES AGAIN
where did the gunpowder come from?
Yeah, this is based off of Yojimbo, by Kurosawa. Same basic plot.
EVERYONE PANIC
Yay the bell again
All I wanted was sugar ;o;
I NEED TO KILL FIRE AND WATER TOO SLOW
12Hipster: It was started with alcohol.
fucking once again get to know what kind of fan
bad guys love exploding barrels
8Smokey the Bear does not approve
keep crawling!
Quick, under the bed
Clint - pyromaniac extroadinaire
KILL RANDOM PEOPLE!
It is based on Yoimbo. But still better.
He truly is the best bell ringer ever
You know what a good movie is? Seven Samurai
The bellringer is the true hero of this story.
find him dont put out the fire
is truly beautiful
shuldnt they try to put it out?
Solid Eastwood
I see you.
BITE HIS LEG
Woah, red eye esteban!

Seven Samurai's amazing, yeah.

Anypony else see that?
4Metal Gear Eastwood
good to see one of us are pretty cool guy .

Look down stupid!
I don't know I kinda like Yojimbo better
They did try to put it out. With bullets.
This reminds me, how long's this movie?
Clint is like lol dumbass
Plotwise
12Amazing how rare it is for people to look down.
Ghosties: You win the chat.
Still alive!
of win, then
4:D
Rashomen is pretty good too.
ALIVE!
Might as well be Metal Gear
*plays still alive*
Looking up is equally rare.
P0ne-zone: it's getting close to finish, we need an epic showdown, and we're done
ooh
i can't apologise nooooooooooo
clueless bad guys are clueless
AHH METAL GEAR
Clint?
Yojimbo is less grimdark, but the antagonists are retarded, what with the hero OPENLY changing sides several times
lol I'm not even trying
CLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINT
Clint cannot believe that worked
That grates a bit.
12METAL GEAR!
Metal gear = the greatest game ever.
12GRRRR!
12METAL GEAR!
wait for the box...
so what's after this?
13We need a flute
snake
Well that's true in real life too, Silverscreen. I mean you hear a noise how often do you think "below the ground!"
OHMYGOD- MEATAL GEAR!?!!
CRAB BATTLE1
I forget, does Clint fashion a bulletproof vest in this one, or the next movie?
People don't look down since they assume the floor beneath them is solid and as such they assume someone ain't hidden between your legs.
Clint? Clint?! CLIIIIIIIIINT!!!!
(mirror's edge)
SNAKE
Snake is partly based on Eastwood isn't he?
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
Metal Gear Pinkie would be 20% cooler.

Clint, you're a terrible artist. That looks nothing like a pony.

Fine. Mule.

I bet Clint Eastwood watches MLP
Then when she actually does the wrap-up, she neglects the scarf and clothes.

Sure it does. She went back to sleep, and slept in.
7Don'cha love it when people make art out of normally unartistic stuff?

That said, Tara's spoken voice is ALSO amazing.
That's not tara? wat?
appajack team is best team

YAY\
Tara Strong has a nice voice, but yeah, its someone else.

The dew in the butterfly wings would freeze.
OH HI TWILIGHT PLEASE DO THIS BLAHBLAH

OH LOOK
7Sounds like a pretty cool guy. :P [No meme intended.]
That meant nonmagic, silver
Rarity being all hoidy toidy
THAT WAS SO HARD
every since i learned that Spike's voice = Near's voice, I can't look at him the same way
spike is sleepy because he's a cold-blooded reptile and is in torpor
Today, on This Old Nest, we'll show you how to build an outhouse.
because 'the non-unicorn way' sounds racist
IT TOOK EVERY OUNCE OF MY ENDLESS INTELLECT TO SOLE YOUR SHITTY DILEMMA
anyone else hear the drawn together voices when twilight talks?
What's the B-movie tonight?
is it just me or does rarity have really huge insectoid eyes
Lazy blody birds.
