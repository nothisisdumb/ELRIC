my God that Green Screen looks horrible
OHAI
Wrek won't have any of this mod fighting, it seems.
08,01technically, i bronystate legally belongs to me
Sumica: yeah but you'll NEVER guess where
/me wildly appears

yes

/me has a lawyer in her pocket
08,01well, that'll be fun if it ever happens
AND MY AXE!
thx for the comment NocturnalBlade on my short story
otakon, my first thought was military hardware
13well it's the advantage to NFS, they reject any DMCA claim that isn't completely filled in
MisterSkids: my pleasure, i really liked that :)

NocturnalBlade: it's a pillow with a printed image on it, usually a girl
Anyway, school calls. Better answer before it wakes my family.

Shizuka: thats a big pillow lol
Bye Kammerjunk
13it is <3

otakon it's just a pillow what you use to cover it is your own bussines
bye Kammerjunk
otakon - only if you're specifically going for the vanity pillow cases
08,01otakon: i'll get you a body pillow with my OC on it
Shizuka, funny you should say that cause I"m 4'11"
13i have four pillows on my bed, usually i have two of them on my side
and you have to go looking for those ones typically
/me listens to music nao

MirrorImage, it's copying files right now cause it's installing LinuxMint on it, and that's probably why Firefox is freezing.
oh well
guys
agnostic is the true path
Shizuka, forgive me... but what's a diest?
we all love ponies right?
but I DO believe there is SOMETHING out there
Nope
13well you can't define existence before the big bang because no information survived
I hate ponies.
Panda - belief in at least 1 diety
the universe is too vast and infinite for us to be alone
godda-
Sonny, NO, I reject them.

13yep
Shizuka you're just setting the trend for 3001
13that and i like manyworlds
I actually have to go to school in a vew seconds -_-
endless and infinite is the same otakon
YOY *clops hooves/paws* WHOOHOO
13if there are infinite worlds then everything must happen
This reminds me: Moonstuck ended :'(
I don't know if I'll go
GASP

WUT
XylemTube: what's Moonstruck?
13there is a universe exactly like this one, except i'm drinking a dr pepper and not a pepsi
I thought moonstuck eneded before it started.
13if there are infinite universes, there must be one :)
(and then Shizuka's drink was Dr. Pepper)
i dont believe in anything infinite
13and actually
Shizuka: indeed, and right now I'm actually doing the shacha like a sissy girl SOMEWHERE
13if there are infinite universes
Panda: i mean the comic has concluded
Shizuka: and there is one where I am not fat and bespectaculed
08,01if there were infinite worlds, by strict sense of the word, time would not exist in any of them
Shizuka, do you like dr pepper?
otakon: nah thats always the same
XylemTube: like i said before, what's Moonstuck?
Shizuka: but with a LEMON in it
13is good stuff :3
Shizuka: :D
or wait, do they still do it in Canada?
it doesn't scale very gracefully
ok screw this I have to go to school

08,01infinity is an ugly concept
Ok, more wubs for shizu. Dr pepper is best drink!
darn it
I hate school
WRONG
no one's awswering my quistion
oh no it's over boo hoo
13infinity is where math says FORGET IT I GIVE UP

13and then cantor had to ruin it and go THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF INFINITY
it's when you do infinity ^ infinity that it gets nasty
Pinkies4thWall: i agree lol
math isnt an exact representation of the universe though
otakon: not if I don't actually learn stuff there wich is wierd
math was created by humans, it has its flaws

Shizuka: do we sitll not know?

DERPY!
We're pretty certain the meteor finished them off
derpy <3 :)
DERPY WAS THE ANCESTOR OF DNA!
this music is reminding me of jame3s and the giant peach
13no we know it was an asteroid, there's a boundary of deposits all over the world, and the crater is on the yucatan peninsula in mexico
otakon - can we ever be truly sure given the time difference?
otakon: bubble liquid spilled on keyboard a year ago, so now it randomly shorts which brings forth a barrage of 4

oni_link: yeah but if I turn that on I can't talk
ok, soup is dna, fruit is atoms, and birds are dinosaurs. one sec gotta write this down..
Shizuka, SB64 would probably want you to play Nintendo at least once :$
otakon: so whats the problem?
What kind of weird science food thing....?
dat camel

Hey, Lost wasnt THAT bad
oni_link: I have to plug the controller into the 360 for power, I have to plug in my controller bc my battery pack is dead so I get a power feedback and I can't use it like that. If I mute it I can't talk

It's all over.
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
:<
Damnit Buytoast
screw you buytoast
:D
hai Chrysalis
Hai
your new task is to destroy Phase4 site Chrysalis http://bsmirror.ariscop.net/
00,02any bugs you find now are bugs that won't happen during an episode stream
I was right.
hmmm
It was all over.
...
....
this is where i wish for a faster connection
Phase4 i broke it
00,02JRP2234, excelent, how?
Phase4 mucking with the css
00,02ok, i'm talking about server bugs
00,02when the server serves you something broken
i broke it
00,02not when you break it client side
to the DDOS!
^
i broke it without using nothing but firefox
:p
you know, for realistic load simulation
well atleast the stream
inb4 Phase4 goes down along with his server
a captain goes down with his ship
so too do web admins
00,02Chrysalis, it should be fairly resistant to ddos, moreso than normal wordpress anyway
00,02infact that should be one of the fastest single-box wordpress installs on the planet
thats some boasting there
lets attack Chrysalis server instead
00,02if you built what i've built then you'd understand the pride :P
# Anything you can do I can do better #
Phase4, I did stuff

That's odd. O_o
I have no idea for that then
this looks as if it shouldn't look that way
I'm using chrome also, and it works just fine on my end
ditto
I just get the buffer show, and that's normal. :P
:P
Well then.
Hmm. Maybe your chrome is blocking something? I dunno
it's working fine for me with chrome
do you use adblock or adblock plus?
Ohai Gold_Demona!
It's diff for everyone
Hiyo MadSurge =D
Maybe you have a firewall or something that's blocking mips
Cuz it looks like your browser is having a hard time connecting to mips.tv
Well then I'm BAAAACK
Welcome back Allie

dat comment..
NewSuperBronyU, :3
'Listen? to this song while reading cupcakes :3 lol' ?
yeah..
Gold_Demona: why can't people in pokemon have a sign above their head that says "I will fight if you talk to me", instead of having them occasionally see you from the other side of the road and running after you? :D
watching MLP:FiM over again :D
NewSuperBronyU
MadSurge, because you wouldn't fight them at all then ^^
I'm re-watching the whole Season 2. No questions.
They see me login, they hating
hi CrimsonPhoenix
Invi|homework: I would, but I carry around lots of underleveled mons to train them, not fight level 60 mons :D
booo! Down with CrimsonPhoenix!
MadSurge, excuses :D
:D
Agh, why so many evolved mons, I want the basic form
I wanna play a cristal nuzlocke :3
Sorry CrimsonPhoenix, but without any actual hatin' your comnet just doesn't seem right
I'm only here for an hour anyway
Gold_Demona: finally got a Rapidash :D
MadSurge: Yay
Hey CrimsonPhoenix you're a stupid moron that doesn't deserve any friends.
I got one in my nuclocke. His name is Mustang.
hatin here is
CrimsonPhoenix, what? but but.....
NewSuperBronyU TALK
*hatin' here like boiling puppies for satan or something
CrimsonPhoenix, You're a jerk
lol
CrimsonPhoenix, Thank you and have a good day you stupid manchildren
/me sobs
there hating
i'mma go watch the whole season 2 :) Byeee
Bye Alli - gone
Now let's put some top hat and do a tap dance
And ohai everyone, I'm back.
wb AdamTheDuck
Okay, wtf, a VOLCANO CAMEL?!
'I just gave my roommate a packet of m&ms with a single skittle intermixed. What do you do to fuck with people?" -ask reddit
wat?
Camerupt?
Yep
yeah...
it's better than a icecream cone though
You mean Failerupt?
Mr. quad-weak to water?
c'mon tgere are worse
Shush, the ice cream made me win many battles!
Yeah, there's the yeti that's quad-weak to fire. :P
o.o
/me has no idea what chat is saying 6_9
Metapod is best pokemon ^^
hey, i love me a geodude
Or those rock/steal types that are quad-weak to fighting AND ground
Ok, that I understand Invi|homework, /)
(\
Is this the harden thing?
gees you guys
yeah
Mutterguy: Metapod evolves into Butterfree
Hooray for first gen. :3
no it
it's the harden thing
That too
:$
As is Kakuna
And all the other "cacoon/chrysalis" pokémon
METAPOD USE HARDEN
iunno theres also lickitung. Clearly that had girls in mind
Wat .-.
Mutterguy: that tongue made me think of giant icecream
*cones
Wat. http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vanilluxe_(Pok%C3%A9mon)
Mutterguy: How does a giant tongue suggest having girls in mind? O_o
Gold_Demona: the Share Experience tool is truly a godsend
You know what's OP pikachu
They seriously ran out of ideas to make an icecream pokemon...
MadSurge: Yes, I love the Exp. Share
Who doesn't?
AdamTheDuck, he has a straw in his brain :D
AdamTheDuck: I thought the volcano camel is more braindead
MadSurge, oh I remember that, was that back in Ruby/Saphire?
Yeah AdamTheDuck
That was gen 3
Then I guess I stopped at gen 3 :/
That's about when I stopped until HeartGold/SoulSilver came out
AdamTheDuck: I'm in the Black postgame, it's filled with previous gen monsters
Then I picked it all up again
no. it's gen 5
my last game was Soul Silver ^^
Black/White are really good. WAY better than Gen 3 and 4
Storywise anyway
AdamTheDuck: some guy had only the camel during a battle, and I was "wtf is that I don't even"
Gold_Demona: Good to know that! :)
I actually don't think Camerupt looks that bad. I just don't like that it's quad-weak to water.
MadSurge, I really loved the steel type pokemons from gen 3 though
MadSurge, can't remember what they're called though... Arrgon or something?
Aggron
And the bird
that bird was awesome.
The phoenix?
What bird? Only steel bird that comes to mind is Skarmory, and that was gen 2
Ehh, I think it started with Sky or something
Yeah Skarmory
Skarmory was gen 2
Wait...
you mean the cloud dragon?
Lemme do a quick search >.>
doess somepony play ponymon?
Yeah Skarmory, they were in Saphire and Ruby.
I'm not playing ponymon until it's actually completed
AdamTheDuck: Skarmory's a gen 2 pokemon though.
it was just hard to obtain i think
Ehh, I still love the design of that pokemon though :P
MadSurge, XD lol yeah I remember
MadSurge, there was this one fisherman
MadSurge: There are guys like that in EVERY game
Right after a guy that kicked my ass with Tentacool and Tentacruel
Good ol' Gen 1
Fun fact: in italian jellifishes are called "medusa" :D
heh
But yeah... No "WTF" moment compares to the time I found out what Garbodor was. XD
Garbodor is awesome just for that :D
It's the logical conclusion to Koffing and Grimer :D
the problem for garbodor is that you recycle, you threaten it's ecologicaol niche!!!
8if
D:
Recycling is eviiiiiiil
You can't win!!!
By the power invested in me. I SHALL MAKETHE STREAM GO LIIIIIIIIVE
(little did poor CrimsonPhoenix know that he had absolutely no power over anything.)
LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
/me licks CrimsonPhoenix .-.
I-it's not working......
is it my staff that's broken?
nah it dazzles even more than ever....so why can't I make this stream live...
because pony
Because magnets prevent you D:
or it's magnetic ponies
FUCKING MAGNETS
HOW DO THEY WORK
there are magnets in the magnet
that's how they work
Lets celebrate the death of chat! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmLwFWc5gMU
i remember the origin of that scene you AdamTheDuck ^^
/me dances
actually magnets works with positive and negative charges in a surface
hello everypony
Ohai Jezebel
and since charges are conduct by metal they travel from metal to metal
hai adam
magnets are huge homophobe btw
Welcome, welcome to the dead and mysterious world we call "chat".
CrimsonPhoenix and elementar magnets work with the spin of the atoms ^^
Invi|homework, Yeah.....that
Ok, so chat isn't as dead anymore.
My science is very rusty
AdamTheDuck, that's because I'm here dazzling all over the place
CrimsonPhoenix, when they spin all in 1 direction they add up their wn magnetic fields and create a really big one
like the power rangers
all this talk about magnets reminds me of that science for kids website I used to play
it was so fun
lol
or Constructicons
Uuuuh, I found a coral monster
we learn how to make soap, huuuh cars ummmmmm
FIRE
I liked power rangers when I was a kid. Now it's just good riff entertainment
also huuuuuh well tons of stuff really
lol AdamTheDuck
Gold_Demona, oh God yes. XD
Power rangers!
Oh man, so many memories.
http://derpy.me/blQqZ
Alpha the evil witch is awake, you need to find five teenagers with attitude
papa pan papa pan papa papan
ayayayayay!
stupid reactionary parent got power rangers bannned because some idiot kid decided to attempt a karate kick through a glass window
Phase4, xD
*Parents
-this applies only to NZ
Mutterguy, lolwut XD
Hey AdamTheDUck. ARe you making any bets on the melbourne cup?
TheRandomkid321, nope :P
/me doesn't like to gamble
Although Borderlands 2 teaches otherwise
oh and TheRandomkid321
I hate when I fell asleep on my chair ._.
AdamTheDuck That's too bad. I know that green moon is going to win... serveral reaons... one of them is that last night my dream had a green moon in the sky. And the horse looks fast.
/me licks TheRandomkid321
my nick hurt like hell..
AdamTheDuck: as long as it's in a videogame with in-game money...
MadSurge, yeah but you'll gamble... Say $150...
I think it's kinda normal just to bet an od 10 dollars on the melbourne cup.
The machine will sometimes give you a prize
/me plays in all the game corners in pokemon
at times it will give you back money
But the money never reaches the amount that you used
is pokemon B&W 2 any good?
yes
quite good
AdamTheDuck: dude, in Borderlands 1 I was swimming in money at the end
So it positively reinforces the action of gambling, but still making you lose dosh
I want my Pokemon Grey
and Grey too
you mean two?
I want pokemon Purple! Red And Blue MIXD TOGETHER!
or maybe it was too expensive to brand both grey and gray throughout the continant
MadSurge, I was looking at Borderlands 2 in a serious mood, then I started licking people and went back to being silly and realised it's just Borderlands being Borderlands :$
11,02I passed out O~O
Gold_Demona: bawww it's not a real sequel Nintendo sold out :D
/me licks NewSuperBronyU .-.
go back to sleep NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU get up
NewSuperBronyU, you were tired of course you passed out
/me licks AdamTheDuck back :D
Go to bread NewSuperBronyU :P
NewSuperBronyU have my babays
AdamTheDuck: that's better :D
NewSuperBronyU How long will you have that name!?
NewSuperBronyU go home, you're tired
MadSurge: It's as much a sequel as Gold/Silver was to Red/Blue
TheRandomkid321, 13 days \:3/
11,02TheRandomkid321: Moo o3o
Ohai NewSuperBronyU
11,0213 days \:3/

11,02Hai Gold_Demona :3

Yaharr~~ landlubbers
AdamTheDuck: one achievement in Borderlands 1 was wasting a ton of money on a completely useless tour :D
TheRandomkid321, it did? .-.
hi NewSuperBronyU :D
wut o.o
Ohai Vivix
Haya adam
/me licks Vivix :P
/me strokes Adam's beak
11,02Didn't realize at the documentary that I was sitting next to John de Lancie's wife until the Q&A /).(\
then you'll upgrade your name to SuperbronyGC?
/me slap Vivix with a pie
http://www.fanboys-online.com/comics/2012-11-02-Fanfact.jpg
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
/me is piefaced- and sad
SB you lucky..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JElywbkSbY
AdamTheDuck Did I send you a skype request? or was that someone else... OH GOD WAS IT SOMEONE ELSE!?

NewSuperBronyU can I touch you!
11,02O.O
???
11,02yesh :3
dat mean I can get to see SB in the documnetary... in HD
TheRandomkid321, nothing here .-.
/me gingerly pokes NewSuperBronyU
AdamTheDuck ...fuck...
You were filmed SB?
11,02I don't get to be in the documentary cause I not special enough O~O
you should be
You need an angrier agent, get you into all the documentaries
being a mod for a livestream of pony!
/me lays on NewSuperBronyU's lap ;~;
Poor NewSuperBronyU :<
/me hugs AdamTheDuck back
/me pats NewSuperBronyU on his widdul head
11,02I was surprised to seeing Max Gilardi there
NewSuperBronyU, have you seen my name in the credits?
Gimme a megaphone, a cricket bat a ticket to LA and I'll fix things!!
well time to cook some duck brb
11,02And then I got really interested when he wanted to ask a question
/me looks at AdamTheDuck
Run...
11,02Especially since Lauren Faust was there
/me runs D:
Wait, from what? :$
LightTrooper105
AdamTheDuck: Didn't you see what LightTrooper105 said? D:
Im cooking duck :)
See! he admits it!!!
NewSuperBronyU: serious question or troll question?
11,02Serious question
Oh GOD NU :<
Inconceivable!
/me gets the fuck out
can't wait for the Brony Documentary to relsaee
11,02"Was there any person excluded from the documentary that didn't fit the image that the movie was trying to potray?"
meh I would cook AdamTheDuck but he too much fat..
Oooh~~
hmmm
OOOOOOOOOUCH
I'd say yes
NewSuperBronyU did you say that im awesome
That question
/me turns AdamTheDuck into a chicken. "There. You're safe now." :>
Some, probably
i need hyper accurate gameboy emulator
11,02JRP2234: You are, but I didn't say anything :(
coolroms!
/me lays flat on the ground rolling around in marinade .-.
11,02They said No
lies I bet
AdamTheDuck what are you doing o.o
Well they didn't want to focus on the shady side, but that's about it
11,02But the next question asked by someone else was the funniest moment
what did he ask?
I need a good gaming PC for Day Z :( DOes anyone know when the Day Z standalone is released?
TheRandomkid321 I hiss at Day Z >_>
I think it's over a year until
11,02A guy was asking the audience basically for if anyone felt the show has changed their perception of the world as a hopeful place. Then Max shouted, "Not me."
XD
!
lol
NewSuperBronyU: as cynical as ever I see :D
Vivix.... Buck that I'm buying Arma 2 Combined ops and installing the mod.
11,02I have footage of it so I will upload on YouTube :)
i need this http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/ but with the gameboy cpu
TheRandomkid321 I have Arma 2 CO Im an admin on its one of its server
http://www.fanboys-online.com/comics/2011-06-13%20Apologies%20To%20Nintendo.jpg

11,02You'll hear me laughing like crazy in the shot /).(\
and I say this.. I use to enjoy DayZ untill people start thinking its a game not a mod
Holy crap Phase4, that's--accurate
I love Max
Vivix, transistor level accurate
Damn that's nice
o-o
Vivix, theres a talk about it on youtube
very interesting stuff
NewSuperBronyU: did you say mooo?
they're doing it for other cpu's as well 6800 is on there already
Nice- I've always wondered if anyone did that.
CrimsonPhoenix, wat XD
11,02MadSurge: No /).(\
AdamTheDuck, I said I love Max

you forget the U AdamTheDuck
11,02I met somepony who visits the site tonight for dinner with me and my sister(\^3^/)
he's an awesome, non sheep person that genuily likes the show andd doesn't let it change his perception for others
LightTrooper105 Well it's so different to the standalone game and it's so well made it might as well be a game and it will be one. But ATM it's merely a well made mod.

Vivix, ohmai, Sigur Ros, my friend has some of their songs on his mp3 player and showed me the other day
Like? I think their soundscaping is---amazing
Of course I love them
Hehe
Well I've only really only heard one song :$
now this is the 2nd
They're good- and strange, they made a CD, my friend has it and I looked at it- it has a white booklet with white pages. No text- the cd is called ( )
/me Bitch slaps Ponies47 "Nopony bitch slaps me!"
and--all the sogns are unnamed- and he sings in a made up fairy language with no words
It's--gorgeous and weird
Wow
And I thought it was just a language I didn't know :$
I think thiis song is icelandic, but that cd had a made up language
Yeah that's right, my friend said they were icelandic
Can't remember the song he showed me though
I'm going to play some AA... this chat is kinda boring right now.
Alright then, bye OohShiny. And may I ask what's AA? :3
AdamTheDuck: Ace Attorney
Yeah- they were part of that strange movement I guess. Like Múm and Bjørk and--stuff
Oh my, that climax.
yeaah- when the kids fly? I'm like - stunned
Oh... Wow...
That was wonderful
Yeaah- they're awesome
I remember watching a documentary about them- and they had their studio in a closed empty pool on the mountainside- recording in that heavy echo
I'm back......and it's still my birthday! (cue song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi_25790iRU)

http://youtu.be/l-a4dk9ZBFA?t=8m50s Oblivion
I dare you to try not to dance to the cupcakes song. I doulbe-dare you
How to tell you're noob at git commiting: "[0e7991] ssh://viviv@git.code.sf.net/p/drawroom/code" <.<
Vivix, o_O
>.> it was my first time
so... what's git?
it eh- is a way of keeping code up to date- so to speak
Phase4, why are you watching Oblivion gameplay? .-.
AdamTheDuck, bored
Whaaaaaa, he has a pet dog! Me want!
/me still hasn't been able to find any companions in Oblivion >.>
OohShiny, file versioning
OohShiny, its so you can write code and keep changes
hmm... I don't get it
if you screw something up you can undo them
I just understood is something a programmer do
Well anyway Vivix, a very strange song this one, this was one of the first few "post rock" songs I heard .-. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJGHJaGlpm4
Dat everypony o3o
Dat Ponies47 o3o
OohShiny, its like writing a book and storing the changes as you write it, so you can go back and check what you changed
hmm
my brain just did a 180
yeah, if you're several people or use several computers, it's pretty helpful
/me listens to link
yeah, with more than one developer source control becomes a must
AdamTheDuck, it sounds like almost a post'ier version of Grizzly Bear
and it reminds me of a local band- but..who
Vivix, wait for the vocal climax .-.
/me is loving it so far
/me interprets the climax as pain (but isn't too sure) 6_9
vocal climax*
I really need to find a brony, or make a brony, in my school
aah daamn, this makes me want to see the mlive-
it reminds me of a mix-- of team me, kråkesølv, grizzly bear, Geraldine fibbers and..something really good
Vivix, link? :3
/me rummages some
/me favs song
I made a friend a brony recently. We've been good friends for a while. feelsgood.
/me notices the new Grand Chase season
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOVE6y0CQ-U&feature=g-vrec Apples :3
I think this season-thingy will never end
*awkward silence*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmB4vU7Kpbw Kråkesølv, team me I've linked before-
Grizzly Bear was that band with that claymation acid video- very folky and indie
I gotta go to school now :<
Bye everypony
Aww~~
byebye
Bye Ponies47
Vivix, what language did you say this was?
Norwegian
you might like bear-farm actually
a bit hard to find though
If only I knew the lyrics :$
hehe
there's a partial translation in the top comments- I think
Seems like the type of song that will have lyrics with an interesting story
yeaah- it's
Ahh, youtube comments
eh touching, I like their lyrics
how I've stopped my reflex to scroll down
hehe, me too-
They're always just full of crap sometimes, so I usually try to not look at the comments...
yeah- no matter what the video someone argues abot something, it's-- odd
"And everytime I forget where I as from, I am brought back home again by worn towels and forgotten childhood memories"
Bah, I shouldn't have stayed up last night.
/me licks DashWithRainbows .-.
Falling asleep in the last 10 mins of my final lesson.
Not the best thing to do.
I once fell asleep during group therapy
everyone was looking at me when I woke up-
Vivix, Arctic Monkeys usually have some very interesting stories in their lyrics http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUUvjzleUK8
ooh yeah
I have that CD, really enjoyable
Which album was this again? Humbug?
yyeah
I need to start listening to more Arctic Monkeys agian >.<
hehe, I haven't heard them in a while either
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in letraset
"No you can't call me her name"
I love awkward he makes the situation and how the music follows a bit
yeaa
Uhh
Yay it's not Monday anymore
14:13 here, woo-
Well in Australia anyway :P
hehe
Well I better get some rest
It's Monday morning here. XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBR5qExJ_kU ever heard these guys?
Goodnight BronyState :P
Night ducky
Goodnight man, sleep well
Not sure if I've linked this before, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAsupqAvNeY
I just love those few seconds of vocals on this track
anyway, time to head off

OH look the bronys put up an add on the hub
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-FM-j8FA0
they did?
yep they just aired it today
there airing it again i guess this afternoon
thats actually a pretty pleasant little ad
I'm impressed
yea not bad, i heard balddumborat at the end too
well the ad isn't as bad as it could have been
And there's the EQD confirmation, lol
So......the brony-thank-you-project GOT GREENLIGHTED?
yep, Dark92Enigma
well they had to apy a fortune just to air it
pay*
yep Dark92Enigma
MisterSkids: and to approve it
yep
Ponies save? :D
I mean, i've heard about this project and it seems self-promotional to me
Unfortunately ^
Don't get me wrong
It came out pretty well, I think. Its short, sweet, and to the point. Its a thank you bit to the Hub. Nothing really more to it, in my view.
has it been aired already?
but i think the hub MIGHT get the credit instead of us
wasnt that the point?
yes the aired it like 30 minutes ago
to give them credit?
there is this girl who works with my friend back home, and she likes ponies, and shes attractive. i want her.
there airing it again sometime this afternoon but im not sure when
dude i cant even find a DATE in this area, so sick of this place
:3, thats because youre not a hawt gel
/me is humble
i live in the ass end of no where too
sucks~
im on fort riley kansas
everybodys inbred around here
now now, RoseBot`, be nice :P
i am being nice
and empathetic
I wish chat had voice indentation
so I could say "Oh, be nice" in that super-gay simpsons-skit way complete with wrist flail
seen the ad, and I cant help to think...meh.
its not great but iits ok
Haven't seen it
will probably see it on next hub live stream I guess
Vivix: its on youtube
/me is lazy
^
lol
Vivix: let me help you with that :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-FM-j8FA0
but ;__;
Vivix watch it or i put you in the naughty corner
kaaai
not bad
and promotes charity
eeyup
/me has no issues with that
and glad they included kids, we don't want to own the show to ourselves
/me is still sad about dream yesterday
HOLY SHIT!
THAT looked like my old DRILL SGT!
what happened MisterSkids
SANCTUM CRAP
/me never got accepted to army, was a free man
u know that thing i out up on the chat earlier
put up*
well it was based on a real dream, and it sucked because it was so real
You didn't get accepted into the army cause you're a wuss veeveex.
:P
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/61498/A-Rainbow-Dream
thats the dream i had
Jmo u so meen ;_;
Mhmm.
regexp! Y U SO HARD
Vivix, regex is not hard :p
;__;
well, this is my first time-
nope, i cant make a sex joke. just to incompatible with my sense of humor
Hehehe
Vivix, spesificly what are you trying to do?
I'd make one for you, but it'd suck
Well, relatively simple- I need to find and replace < and > in strings to make it impossible for people to enter html into my innerHTML
there's--probably a better way
o_O
in javascript?
yeah, doing a small chat in the corner of the drawroom thing I'm making- and currently it does pass everything as html- so trollable
i hope you're doing this server side also :P
should just do IRC webchat
unless I misunderstand
brb
Vivix, well tbh its probably easier to just do string.replace
I was thinking of doing it on the receiving side of the faye in browser- but I could intercept and do it in the node.js server
Ooh-yeah
not much need for regex here
and Hanako yeah it would be easier to do lightIRC but, I want to avoid all plugins
Vivix, i've got part of a javscript irc client lying around
string replace and find isn't something I've done much of- so yeah thanks, that's probably better
got as far as what tabs to draw what messages too
Oh?
then got all confused and mored
Ah nice
bored'
I'm having issues with quitting-
uses a socket.io server, but all that does is send each line in a packet, parsing hapens client side
I mean irc client would be nice, but it would be nice to have a room where only the current people drawing can be in the chat-
ah yeah, I'm using faye which is bayeux client- but it is similar to socket.io in how you use it
Vivix, well you could do that easy enough, the server would have op privilages on the irc channel and +v those who are drawing
Oh yeah-
A bit more advanced than what I was doing, but something that was my first thought- people like irc- people in paintchat probably want to stay on irc
ah, Vivix: socket.io will use websockets if avaliable and avoid the http request overhead
well paintchat with the chat in irc would be perfect for bronystate
depends on whos using it
Vivix, as an option it'd be nice
Yeah, I was hoping to have it optionable, was going to have lightIRC as optionable for people who don't mind flash
but if--using socket-io to actually connect to irc yourself isn't too crazy advanced- that could be a cool addition
anypony else lost in this convo? Cuz its all going over my head...:D
this is now a geek channel
Woo~~
/me tries to be a geek, but is only able to be a nerd
Vivix, speaking of which this channel has a geek channel, should join it
derp, this network
has a geek channel
ah yeah
word is hard
XD
hehe
channel has channel within
so i herd you like channels
bak got my coffee
But yeah I should, I'm still new to most of this, but I really want to learn and finish this project. So, other people is nice to talk to
Vivix, the code public
?
is the?
HERP DERP WORD
yeah, *finds*
Phase4: Language is your enemy this morning
had to restart
https://sourceforge.net/projects/drawroom/
Sylandest, language is my mortal enemy
im both in this chat and Celestia Radio Chat listening to CR
latest commit isn't 100% stable, but yeah
its funny how its easier to start linux in a vm, setup xming, and use that than any of the native clients on windows
so i got some of my fan fic up http://www.fimfiction.net/story/60261/1/The-Dealer%27s-Hand-/Who%27s-Dealt-What
windows has terrible terminal emulators
/me is a terrible terminal noob
I managed to crash my git commit thing like 3 times, by accidentally opening wrong ocmmands and getting lost
had to go in and delete index.lock <,<
/me doesnt even know wat a terminal is
Vivix, http://paintchat.bronystate.net/drawroom-code/index.html so i need this faye thing
oh yes uh
node.js npm faye I think
what does paint chat do anyways
It's all very testy and strange atm- eh
Vivix, might as well set it up, this server does bugger all and nothing
the missing images are in 1.5 folder on sourfecorge,
hehe
when its not running the minecraft server it runs BerryPunch, the paintchat server, ariscop.net, bsmirror.ariscop.net and thats it
Aah
which is actually tiny workload
yeah
I never looked at how paintchat works- probably should have
srsly, BerryPunch is the most strenous thing it has to run
but yeah faye is an npm for--node, and then you have to rewrite the ip's it connect to in index.html
Vivix, i've got a decompile that i worked on for a while, you have a bitbucket account?
noo- I can create one
Phase4 what is berry punch
probably not of much use though, its all decompiled java, which is like obfuscated code obfuscated again
alexxm, bot
it kicks you if you spam :P
ooh yeah-
ah ok
ARGH stupid chats blocking me from doing work
there to interesting!!!
stupid sleep
2am
not tired
Stream, y u no load
want to stay up and experiment more
i wish i didnt need sleep
pony_699, no stream right now
http://faye.jcoglan.com/ here's the documents for faye
Sumica should be up soon
oh ok
I am considering socket.io, since- websockets
sumistreem
looks like theres versions of faye with websockets
hm- yeah
persistent connections using WebSocket-
long poll via http post
Oscure SNES rpg ahoy! :$
websockets save a lot of cpu time
and network lag
Ah good- that's one of my worries for the drawing itself- you know, that's a lot of ery big arrays flying around
hmm, wonder if i can route faye through nginx
ERod, the Blockbuster Buster, uploaded his ''Mirror Mirror'' review on my birthday! this is the best coincidence that happened to me today!!! (so far) *SQUEE*
AND MAN, that movie sucked
Ello there everybrony.
Hai Malavolent
sry guys, im listening CR talk about bronystate
how've you been Malavolent
MisterSkids: as in TGWTG.com's CR?
test
mornin everypony
it ponifyme with Celestia Radio
DoctoDoctorWho: good morning!
mornin
DoctoDoctorWho: today's my birthday!
alexxm: Pretty well actually, how about you?

how are things DoctoDoctorWho
Suddenly
lots of activity
i'm good Malavolent
hia Dark92Enigma, happy birthday!
People are waakin' up
^

MisterSkids: where is that page with CR talking about Bronystate? i need to know
happy birthday again Dark92Enigma :3
/me hugs DoctoDoctorWho and MLP_Brovakin
there website is here http://ponify.me/chat/

If hitler was a comedian, would it be a lolocaust?
Don't you have school or something?
school?
teacher inservice today, no school!
MisterSkids: oh, C.R. for Celestial Radio, not TGWTG.com reviewer CR
uh... aparently debian stable does not have a node js package
what is this...skeweel?
this is anoying
MisterSkids: Who IS a fellow brony
Huh-
I was worried about node.js or RoR making it hard for people to host this-
urgh
it wants me to compile
oh yea there doin a 200 hour marathon, and so far its awesome
/me pats Phase4 on the back
Vivix, well the alternatives arent much better in that regard anyway
plus there teaming up with bronystate for the new season
True-
Phase4: it'll be alright phase,
heck, the paintchat on bronystate used to be hosted on a laptop at Luna's place
!
had to be moved when the laptop finally gave out
Wow
Must be a lightweight server-
to be fair she has some massive connection, like 50mbit simultanious
!
what happened to the laptop?
Vivix, not really, just lightly used
ah yeah, true
DoctoDoctorWho, cant quite remember, either stopped working or caught fire and stoped working
either way i think smoke was involved
gone for 15 minutes electrics are being turned off
:D
Phase4: I also tend to forget whenever computer catches fire.
To all skyrim fans! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmdXDH9b1s&feature=g-u-u :3
Im on an 11 year old dell laptop right nowe
now*
MLP_Brovakiin: fekkin inapropriate content
DoctoDoctorWho: Sorry, I had to share it :p

OK im trying to get some work done on my fan fic but ill leave u guys with THIS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUfkUs_zz_w
/me doesnt have a youtube account
DoctoDoctorWho: Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRmdXDH9b1s&feature=g-u-u&has_verified=1
nope, still blocked.
Sorry :c
Damn, it's less than 7 days to the season 3 start.
Gotta watch all the episodes.
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 4 days, 23 hours, 35 minutes, 53 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
FOUR DAYS.
Malavolent, watch all the pony!
Can I panic now?
s'alright, I can live without a skyrim trailer
ALL OF IT
EVEN G3
D:
:O
Eevery single pony must be watched
Phase4: Well I would watch it, if it has any connectivity to G4, which it hasn't.
had*
Malavolent, it has no connectivity to anything and its better that way
we've had an applebloom episode
I watched G3 once, my eyes started burning
we've had a sweetie bell episode
inb4
I wonder what scootaloo will be like, if she gets an episode
build faster node!
10$ says we meet her parents and a thousand fanfics are thusforth ruined
I want Celestia and Luna background story.
Oh wait, there will be one.
^^
Well then, I want Octavia to speak.
Oh, would you look at that.
Malavolent, that was rumored iirc
Phase4: Don't you dare to ruin my dreams.
also to be clear, no spoilers in this channel
DoctoDoctorWho I exypect a lot of Fanficts to be ruined by S3 :P
you guys seen the brony commercial?
s2 ruined it's fair share too, but it's okay
Lil_B, S2 ruined a bunch
those old fics are still fun, just different
Lil_B: It's only natural, also, hi :)
05evenin'
dunno if I should be proud of that
yeah, i like some of the pre S2 luna
Hai Wrek :)
Aften, go'aften
Science Luna!
ohai Wrek
has anyone saw crusaders on today?
Hey Wrek, what do your viking eyes see?
Wrek: Where have you been?!
Phase4 I don't read Fanfics :/ not that I don't like them, but I m just not interrested
hi Malavolent !
and hi everryone!
/me is crazy avid fic reader
Lil_B, thats fair
05Malavolent: gmod vids
Hai Lil_B :)
Vivix, /)
05DoctoDoctorWho: not here
o hi lil
(\
Wrek: Carry on.
Hey Wrek!
Vivix: Same here, I have 1 half done fic and 4 planned
hey MLP_Brovakiin and RainbowDashSavior !
Nice
Anyway, as much as I like reading fanfics, the canon storyline is more interesting to me.
That I agree with, fanon is good spice
but--canon is gold
Hey Lil_B
I can have fun reading stuff that totally destroys canon, though
hey AttackWithHugs !
they are all I have to read anymore, I dont have access to a library
I wonder what you guys will do once the season premieres
i enjoy fanfics regardless of canon
can get fiddly keeping each fanworld seperate though
Yeah, it's like- canon is cool, fanon is cool, if this adventure breaks canon- well, fanon
and all the good books are done or I dont have the money to buy them
yesterday, VGA had the Finale of Deadly Premonition >.< I hope it gets uploaded soon!
hmmm
I can get a link to my fic if anypony's interested
Vivix, does faye care what address its got? can it handle non-transparent proxys?
Hm- I'm not sure- internet programming is still new to me
I think the client basically connects in a way browser would-
Anyone here have an open minecraft server for people to play on?
Anypony?:(
Sup suckas?
Sup, Hoody|Skool? How's school going?
Hai Hoody|Skool :)
ohai
Anypony wanna read my fic?
Wish I could
Oh and Phase4 make sure you update line 65 and line 8 in index.html- as they're just set to localhost while I test stuff
Wow its dead in here
DoctoDoctorWho, not like i'm getting sleep anyway, link?
YAY! brb

Lyras and Colgates german voices sound like men
/me haggs MadSurge and Invi !
hi Expoti|Fail
DoctoDoctorWho: may we, the current generation, rectify that :D
Jake when did Lyra speak german?
Jake, but chrysalis was not as bad as i expected
Hi Lil_B :3
chrysalis was kinda good
Lil_B, this morning at about 10am
MadSurge: I fully plan on doing so
also: hay Lil_B
Lil_B: in the german canterlot wedding episode
Invi pff, had school xD what happened?
Jake it is out ?!
Lil_B: kids love to be scared after all :)
wanna link?
Even if it means having to get up in the morning and wrestle a shark
Lil_B, well episode 25 and 26 in german happened ^^
want a link?
Jake yes!
Invi why them first?
no idea
lets see if my internet can take it
http://www.youtube.com/user/DFXPony here ya go
Jake: are you german? or do you just like watching the show in other languages?
nono i'm german
Jake, is that your channel?
nope
aw
hey my record of this broke
and then i found this
Jake, Wechselponies /).=
Invi: indeed
sonnenschein sonnenschein der käfer is erwacht.
klatsch in die hufe und tu was dich glücklichh macht
oh gawd ja, but that was not that bad
well
could be worse
yeah, taking into account what they had to translate there, this was the best one could hope for :/
I was in Miami once and it was cool
well, gonna load it a bit before I watch it fully
actually it was hot...
haha, yeah. I live up in northern wisconson.
gets pretty cold
some day i'll visit the west coast
you know E3, Bronycon....
VEGAS
uhm
there tends to be alot of idiots around thats true, but dont worry, we arent all like that.
I have always had a deep seated respect for the germans
heading out to shops back soon
i know
well, so far the Translation is a C , the first song was very well done
Lil_B, i think the this day aria was good
but again, it looks really much like the Translator have never heard the actual Audio-Take...
has*
sounds*
yes they did a *good* job with this one
I never was the one to bash the germand dub, it is damn hard, but I hate Stuff that could have been easily avoided
they shouldn't have translated absolutly everything
Lil_B: like Lyras man-voice
Invi I actually, like that they try to come up with german words instead of just using the english words, it's a translation after all
i know how hard it is. I've dubbed 3 cartoons myself but this really is just a bit "messy"
Lil_B, yeah but names like changelings could have been left english
Formwandlew would be good for that
I tried to tranlate the Song "Pollyanna" once, with a lot of sayings
but in general they did a good job though
*Formwandler
I'm going to take off folks.
bye Everlasting_Joy
bai Everlasting_Joy
cya Everlasting_Joy
Bye Everlasting_Joy :)
bye Everlasting_Joy !
I'm sorry for the short stay, I am just need to leave for a while.
Well, I would expect them to translate Changleing, I mean, it's supposed to represent the "Changing" otherwise, german kids wouldn't even get it and the whole purpose of the name would be gone
kids would not even get that beachlor party joke
No bachelor parties in germany?
well, that's supposed to be an adult joke, the word "Changleings" not
yes thats important for kontex
Rarity just dudste Cadence... what?
uuh they are friends? ^^
hi
hi kinixys
*dusted?
Hai kinixys :)
but Wechselponis sounds kinda wrong
hallo kinixys
ohai kinixys and Applechip
DoctoDoctorWho no, it'
hello
Hai Applechip :)
DoctoDoctorWho it's a german word that, as far as I know, does not have an english equivalent
hallo Applechip
DoctoDoctorWho, you has 2 meanings in german
Jake yes, I think "Wechsler" or "Verwandler" would have been better
wechsel-ponis translates directly to change-ponies
I think its funny how there's no e in ponis, makes it look like they're using internet speak
Schilderwald is a german word without equivalent
yay trotting
:D
Jake: if it doesnt have an equivelant is there a way to define what it means?
well in german the o is short so it would sound like ponnis
brb guys
DoctoDoctorWho: well schild means sign and wald forest it basically means "sh*tload of signs"
ok, This Day Aria was epic :D just perfect!
:D
*wald is forest
hey bronies I got out of school early
what time is it for you sugarpony875?
anoter tricky one is "geborgenheit" I have not the slightest idea how to define that
for me it's 11:42
roughly 10:40 here
17:43 here
Jake whut?
?
Just define what it means or what it relates to.
no? :)
/me isnt good with military time
Fluffeh left without saying bye
:<
Good morning, everypony! :)
Hai RaveBrony :)
/me waves to MLP_Brovakiin
/me but assumes Jake means somewhere around 5:43
Have I missed much?
RaveBrony: we were talking about the german mlp dub
Ah, lol.
Never heard, I've been watcing the French mlp tho :)
*heard it
Kurra: i guess the closesd to feelen "geborgen" is feeling save
RaveBrony: What would a brave pony like rainbow dash do? I surrender!
feeling saved or safe??
Jake yeah, "The feeling of beeing Save" woulkd be "Geborgenheit"
Lol!
there is probably a singe english words trhat describes that as well, but that's probably one of the uncommon words
I heard there is no word that describes it
RaveBrony: could you send me a link to the french one i wat to compare the dubs
Jake: Sure, one sec
well, "Saftyness" would fit
ohai pony pepple
DoctoDoctorWho ... I'm a german too...
isn't safyness just a word creation
Jake: https://www.youtube.com/user/BronyFrench
The french dub is awesome :3
http://zipmeme.com/uploads/generated/g1352134132272081841.jpg
But is it correct? No clue :D
Jake well, an exaptable word-creation I'd say
Yay for German and its word composing.
lets see how much french is still stuck in my brain
Malavolent the wonder of the word-stacking princip :P
Ive always found german whenever I heard it sounding perpetually angry, I dunno why.
Lil_B: Yeah, giving foreigners headache since... forever.
yay for Flussschiffahrtscapitänswitfenrentenversicherungsanstalten (yes its a word)
:)
It's typical for proto-germanic to be able to stack words
i should trot more
english is about the only langauge I know where you aren't allowed to stack words
/me went to his first concert last night
you aren't
?
DoctoDoctorWho: I learn German, but I don't especially like it, it seems so cold to me.
English, on the other hand...
DoctoDoctorWho: ever listent to arabic?
DoctoDoctorWho most times you actually hear it is in movies or the TV, they usually speak rather clear "propper" german, which, often sounds angry or stiff to other people
Yeah
I've herad plenty of germans who sound perfectly sweet
there are compound words, but thats as far as it goes with the word stacking
Lil_B: interesting
^^Mmmm cheese: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-QYyd4UF6A
in norway it's like, Fiske biter and Fiskebiter mean two slightly different things
DoctoDoctorWho: What about UnderSea?
and the first one is wrong
ich könnte jetzt auch einfach deutsch weiter schreiben
Hi folks
Jake, ja, aber das wär unhöflich :/
hi Tervicz
total
Meine deutsche, sie ist nicht gut, alles nicht gut
Jake nope, against the rules :P
Jake, geez, use perfektum man, had a hard time translating this.
Malavolent: as I said, it doesnt go farther than compound words
Lil_B, nah. just if we hold an entire conversation auf deutsch it's against the rule ^^
Invi I know, that'Äs what I usually say too xD
oh god french pinkie made me lol
Invi I hoab eh kaa ahnung mäh wat is älaubt un was net
ei dann gugge doch mo nach uf der website
^ wat.
I had german for 3 years
oh gott sachsen
Lil_B, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
I can't read it at all
Jake, saarlänner
from what Ive seen of german, it isnt completly foreign, I can look at some german sentances and (somewhat) read what they're saying
Nein mann, ich will noch nicht gein...
Jeg hakke aning om hvar som er lov eller ikke
Jake Hesse
ANd that's about all the German I know
Tervicz, lol. that was a bad song ^^
that's dumb that multiple languages aren't allowed :p
internet is international yo!
DoctoDoctorWho: You really don't want to see how many kinds of die, der, das do the use.
yeah if everyone would speak their own language we would have a huge mess in heer
Not to mention german inflection (is it the word?)
I can't hold an accent, I'm always switching from Hessian, to Bavarian to Friesisch to Öst
wow i still understand like 5% of the french dialogs
inflection?
I never thought I had an accent untill yesterday
A'ight peeps, I gotta get some earplugs and then finally go back to the pool!
me too, until I heard an rtecording of myself, I sound so horrible
See you later :)
Invi: I don't really know what's the english word, it's like when you have "zu der schule" etc.
oh god that stuff...
Yep.
Though I probably shouldn't complain, our language is even harder.
everything is happening so much
Genitiv, Akkusativ, Dativ, uuh...
Invi: Yeah, that's it.
hey russia has even more
well, Russian is actually worse, they have 7
supposedly a north minnesotan accent sound like when you take a normal sentance and squish it so the words run together
^
in russia you don't write down the words as you speak them
oh
o.o
Lil_B: So do we, but these 7 are the same while you have 4 and they are different for der,die,das,plural
wat.
Malavolent I have no idea
Inb4 someone starts writing in Klingon...
it's like the word beaucoup that is spoken as boku
In russia "Blue" does noit exist , always dífferentiate between light-blue and dark-blue
Russian isn't that hard.
Since it's familiar to my language.
just get drunk
HOROSHO!
Once you learn azbuca, you're pretty much set.
I listened to myself once and said http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Dramaticremovalcropped_5788.jpg
I heard Icelandic is one of the hardest languages
mlp in another language is like: words words words pinkie words words
test
test?
exactly
uh ja
Not even my German neighbours can understand most of it.
well, it isn't german
not even same group
Czech is slavic, german is germanic
oui
So, who is your guys's favorite ponies?
da
Vivix: True, also English is germanic and Russian is slavic.
Every Pony ... and with that I mean Rarity
its clearly no one eles then everypony
english is anglo-saxon, germanic and some other thigns though isn't it?
can't decide between Twily and Pinkie
English is quite the mixture actually
Is it?
latin-french-german-norse mixed with saxon?
yes
yeah, lotsa latin
it is a very mixed up language, which is why it has so many doublewords
Laters all!
Exit isnt an english word, its actually pure latin
also why it has you you you instead of du de dere
English has germanic and romanic roots
well, in german, freaking EVERY Workd has a second meaning that can have nothing to do with the other meaning, >I imagine that to be confusing
DoctoDoctorWho: Well, "Robot" was word made up by Czech as well.
I cant choose a favorite pony! they're all too cute!
Robot is czech yeah
huh
And with that word ends list of things I'm proud about.
nun meine lieben, ich muss mich nun Verabschieden, mehr Arbeit zu erledigen, Adiö
languages are fun, but I don't know enouh about them
"Skynet invades Chekoslovakia" Most Ironic movie ever
Hehe
bye Lil_B
bis irgendwann später Lil_B
Æ skjønn itj ein sjit
bis bald, Lil_B
/me hugs Invi Jake and bicyclerepairman !
Aufwiedersehen, Lil_b.
A friend of mine once went to Germany. I told him he should totally visit Ausgard, and just follow the signs to get there. :D
>_>
/me didn't get the joke
Fun fact: Ausgard means "Exit"
Ooh
uhm
Ha!
Ausgang, you mean?
Burgermeister: that wouls be ausgang
Avgang?
If 1 man ruled the world, Im guessing there would be everyone having to know english as a default, but otherwise pple can speak whatever they want.
Ausgang vs Avgang, two germanic languages juxtaposed
there's Abgang in German
English isn't that great for a international language
but it's a beautiful and poetic language
also aufgang
Vivix: Why not? It's pretty easy.
if one man ruled the world, we'd have a constructed language-
that's the thing, it's easy and pretty and I llove it
but for business and such
it's a bit too loosely defined
nah english is fine. almost everyone speakes it already
<,<
Why doesn't just anyone speak Esperanto?
there is in fact a world language and it is really easy but noone speaks it
well--it's strange
A nice example of constructed language.
Esperanto and Latin are two world languages, and yeah Esperanto is nicely done- but eh international language just sorta happens I guess
Vivix: its already spoken in at least 100 different countries. Not to mention its the 2nd most spoken language in the world
I'm not saying it's baad
Vivix: Good luck learning latin.
I was trying to learn it and gave up pretty soon.
I'm saying that IF we were to change to an international language, a constructed one would be better than english
i'll just put this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24tnc4GKzUo&feature=related
hm maybe but then people have torelearn it Vivix
Only reason its not 1st is cuz china has so many fuckin people
having a living language for international science papers means that word change over time and things become obsolete
China has many languages, Mandarin is one of them
Of course we won't change to an international language, english works just fine as it is, even if it is very legalese when we have to
woha wait they really call the changeling queen chrysalis in the german episode :O
:O
I feel fanscerviced
:O
howley carap!
in a good way?
Jake: I've never heard it called that before...
German dubbing is pretty decent.
well twilight mentioned it once during the actual wedding
Turn up the volume : Rotate upwards the magnitude
Can't say the same about Czech one.
Jake, well wechselponykönigin Puppenkokon sounds awful :D
totally
this would be a 14 of 10 of awkwardness
indeed
i can't wait~ for season 3~
Vivix: Im not saying that you said english is bad, and as a matter of fact very much appreciate the complement, I just think that english would be the most obvious choice for an international toung
noone can wait
anyway luna eclipsed on friday yay
DoctoDoctorWho, in the real world yeah, totally. Just like german and latin was before it
Jake, german Luna :D
It's the current dominator, but in an imagined world if we were to say we need one language for entire world- you know
Invi: oh dear god
yeah
german royal canterlot voice :D
i heard german braeburn would sound sexy
oh
lets see
oh yes not that bad
have a link?
no
aw
My thoughts toward Season 3 --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WxulBzEIyE
was a recording
http://www.youtube.com/user/DFXPony try if this one has it
yep
the episode i sin
yeah that is really nice
sounds like some kind of teen star
hm well but better than big mac ^^
yep
as far as i remember, big mac sounds too old
he got so much more text

what would you say how fluffy-soft is pinkies mane?
fluffier than a baby kitty
something more specific?
what is the official measure unit for fluffyness?
I know it smells like cotton candy, as far as fluffy Id say stiffer than cotton but somewhere in the large quilt area
the measure for hardness is rockwell
nah. too hard ^^
Imagine balling up a blanket and then hugging it
except hairish
would be better for the body
for rarity :D
yo whats up yall how yall doing?
Invi: I imagine velvet
hi moopy. how soft is pinkies mane in rockwell?

oh well i'll just pretend the tail is fluffy enough and attach it

Jake: What, they don't like pony in their borderlands 2?
kinda i told him about the real meaning of the mechromancer
If you mean that she's intended only for unskilled players
bullshit
i don't know whats his problem really
she's easily the hardest vault hunter to play depending upon tree
but he refuses to play her because the skills names
What, the pony references?
yes and only that
there are pony referenced in borderlands?
Tons of 'em
I'm wondering if it will ruin the game for co-workers. I'm going to find out..
yes the mechromancer has skills like: 20% cooler or potent as a pony ore the stare
Fluttershy's mentioned in the credits
Jake, well if that keeps him from playing the game, Pech für ihn ^^

Shizuka: How much did that keyboard cost?
13$95
whoa
WHAT
....
13normally like $120 but amazon had it for $75 for a long while
Shizuka, can it shoot lasers?
95 DOLLARS FOR A CLICKY CLACKY SCREEN PRINTER MAKER?
mechanical?
Nice keyboard, Shizuka
damn
13even though the price had gone up so much
13so much wub <3
Your grandma is awesome. :D
can you PLEASE stream Shizu
Keyboards that cost much are usually worth it
all the beating they get-
hi dudes and dudets
they cry and try to work hard, but we keep beating them-
13i've seen pictures of g11s that went through even worse treatment

aceranther, hio
13like WSAD being completely worn out and letting the backlight show through
hai aceranther :)
13i'm not nearly that bad to my stuff <<
sounds like my old keyboard
13dat new key feel, feels like my typing is faster <3
except shift and enter were gone too
13you can see the white spots where the coating wore away on mine, mostly racing games and thumb rests
13no idea why F6 and F7 have spots though
maybe you sliped a few times?
13only thing i can think of is maybe audiosurf, messing with the volume control
136 and 7 are probably where the rest of my fingers would rest
ok
In light of this, I'm thinking that if I ever get a tablet, I'm totally getting a Samsung Galaxy tablet.
hmm streams not showing up for me
13no one's streaming atm
streams are considered fun
and have rightly been forbidden
well usually it gives me a window at least, its just thowing an error
so Shizu, STREAM
...kind of rude
Shizuka: Want me to spank the spoled children? :P
im just saying its giving me an error where i normally get the buffer show :/
Now you have the error show
maybe he just dosent want to stream:P or our computers are really bad6_9
No error on stream here, sure it's not an ad?
flutterMEDIC you could say PLEASE.....just saying
i just have the bufferingn show so i'm not sure whats going on
that would help amazingly
Actually the buffering show ran for three days straight
I'm watching cartoons on another tab :P

08,01i just realised that the stargate theme mashes up perfectly with Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode
Dat realization.

O.o
I just realised Ayejay stinks.
:<
:>
/me 08,01has a weird brain sometimes
/me hugs Jmo :D
same
I don't like that with a touchscreen keyboard the screen can feel real warm when I type
08,01also, the music in the first few seasons of Stargate SG1 was FUCKING AWESOME
08,01but then went downhill
Hug me again, and I will smother you with oats.
/me hugs Jmo
/me hugs Jmo and hides in her pillow fortress
Except you.
/me hugs Jmo :P
08,01the score was very filmic

/me laughs and wriggles around happily
08,01also, i'm missing the TV movies
o u fluffeh
o u jaymoo
:3
08,01it's such a pity that stargate is over now
08,01and all spinoffs are basically indefinitely cancelled
08,01just like star trek...
08,01i mean, what's happened to epic scifi lately?
Trruth has been spoken-
08,01we still have the same, if not more, people interested in it
Fringe and warehouse
they ruined scifi
I didn't even realize
08,01yes.
even eureka
which was nice and quirky
08,01the last 10 years have not been kind to scifi
08,01with one exception
cancelled to funnel money into warehouse
08,01BSG.
08,01absolutely epic
bsg?
oh
okay
08,01Battlestar Galactica
I'm not changing my nick. XP
08,01it was one of the best shows of the last 10, 15 years
i have a movie of that show
the only sci fi i like is star wars
08,01i just don't get how things like Journeyman and The Middleman can be cancelled in favour of shit like... *sigh*, Sanctuary...
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: do it!
08,01BSG is really, really good
08,01i don't, actually
08,01i deleted my copy of it to make way for an HD torrent of it i found
08,01then demonoid went under
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: that's what made the series so interesting!
Does my name sound like a female name?
08,01the actual ship was basically crap, and antique; which is the very reason why it survived, and the other battlestars didn't
nick*
seems neutral for me
I think it sounds feminine
because the cylons couldnt just hack and disable all the systems in a single attack
I couldnt decide :/
I remember when not all series of drama needed a love interest
G'day
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: robots attack humans. they take over all the systems of the state of the art ships using techno wizardry. this ship didn't have network computers, because it was so old and shit, so it survived the attack
Hi, HavokOC. :)
Hai HavokOC :)
08,01it then leads a rag-tag group of surviving ships to find a new home
08,01or, attempts to
Hey AJIsAwesome and MLP_Brovakiin :D
all while using as little tech as possible
08,01simple premise, executed absolutely sensationally
so the main enemy are, cyber hackers?
cylons
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: robots
AI run amuck
08,01and my god, the new style centurions are *TERRIFYING*
08,01seriously
Chrysalis: because AI's have never turned on their masters before
how've you been HavokOC
the classic humans make robots, humans make robots do stuff, robots kill humans
I've been good alexxm, How about you? :P

MadSurge: thank you! she looks so cute!
AJIsAwesome: Pinkie on normal happy day <3
/me hugs MadSurge
Dark92Enigma: of course, I chose it because purple is awesome!
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: true
who was the tenth? Tennant?
yes
Yep
David Tennant. Woop
08,01i think maybe my harshest criticism abotu Doctor Who is that it's overrated; both by fans, and the BBC itself
He's the only one I've seen
08,01it's sci-fi for the peanut gallery
08,01or, at least, new docto who is
isn't the demographic early teens though?
08,01old doctor who is great as a children's show
less sci fi, more like wizardry
08,01old doctor who falls in the same vein as Star Trek: Voyager
Some examples: Hikari, Kaori, Airi, Eri, Akari, etc.
08,01see, i'm a really massive Star Trek fan; epically massive, i love Star Trek
every so often when a new species pops up in doctor who, i'm like "dude... whose ass did they pull THOSE from now?"
Im not even sure why Im arguing, Im not even that big a fan of DW
which doesnt mean i dont liek the show
08,01but I love Voyager only because I grew up with it
08,01objectively, it's crap sci-fi
i guess*
08,01DS9 is probably the high point of Star Trek, when all is said and done
Honestly I think Time Turner wasn't based on anyone
I'm actually pretty good with Japanese girl names, not so much with Japanese boy names. >->
I watch star trek for the Q episodes
but standard hourglass and his colourscheme amde some fans do it
nothing more
Vivix you know nothing.
NOTHING
08,01even TNG, which i adore, has its share of bleh episodes
/me screams
08,01but DS9 just works so very well
TNG was the last one?
Enterprise was the last one
Dark_Horst, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFpGpF_v34&feature=g-u-u :D
no, that was enterprise
the archer sereis
Oh, Enterprise was the one I followed-
08,01y'know, even though i initially didn't like Enterprise, i've warmed to it
Vivix: go
but it was alright ;__; it really was
08,01because honestly, it's better than a lot of Voyager episodes
it had too many timetravels and "this was a dream" episode, but it wasn't bad
13oh joy comcast is cutting out again...
08,01it was a lot like TNG, but with the focus of DS9
Vivix: right now go watch the rest of the startrek series now do it
Invi: hm. downgrade
My personal fav sci-fi is Warhammer 40k, doesnt seem to have that big a fanbase tho
Can't ;__;
could be worse
I watched some here though
true
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: 40k is pretty big over here
Vivix: youtube, and if you google you can find some, and theres also netflix
not here there isn't
Netflix here has very few series
08,01aye
but yeah youtube and google, but not riiight now, later, I rarel watch tv series
enterprise was probably my favourite of the shows
even though i grew up with enterprise
*tbg
**tng
Vivix: :|
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: half my friends play 40k, but i don't myself
gah
40k is something I never got into-
and here's the stupidest reason you'll ever hear: Because of shoulderpads
wah?
I thought they looked silly so I never checked it out
Im not sure thats possible tho
Vivix: they're called pauldrons on armor :P
Oh yeah, true
It's a silly reason- but, yeah, never checked it out.
which reminds me
It's gotten so popular thouh that I kinda want to, but--sillyy look
oh, I didn't know that with (ri)... everytime you learn something new :)
13yeah comcast is being shit today so no streams from me
08,01oh, by the way
08,01HAPPY ANARCHY DAY EVERYONE!

http://images.4chan.org/m/src/1352147772162.jpg
I thought we were finally going to have a conversation about 40k lore, but noooooo.
Bacon[Hazard]: mayhaps
Dat Gendo.
Bronysith: dat gendo
Bronysith, XD
STOP STARTING GENDO
http://i.imgur.com/6XH4p.jpg
cowvarkian: You should keep Borderlands 2 and Ass's Creed III. I would work for it if I were you.
STOP STARTIN
I mean START STOPPING
Oi cowvarkian you startin'/
*?
Bacon[Hazard]: I already have worked for it, I just have multiple ways to complete my task if neccessary
BL2 and AC3 are both great games. I would keep them if I were you.
Bacon[Hazard]: yeah, I probably will
borderlands 2 is overrated
Bronysith: yeah, it is
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/315b6eee34346f7f89d1cb263acaa2c2.png My little Shoggoth, my little Shoggoth, aaaaahhhhh~
the only reason people love it is because INTERNET
Bronysith: doesn't mean its bad
You guys do realize that there a multiple refrences to MLP in that game.
god i wish Assassin's Creed 3 would come out sooner for PC
Bacon[Hazard]: so?
doesnt make it good
Yes, we've already heard it several times.
Bronysith: does it make it bad though?
"OMG THEY SAID PONIES"
That's not why I like it.
i can completely see why people hate this fandom
Sometimes people like some shooty fun time, and Borderlands delivers
Bronysith: because we're full of cynical self loathing nerds?
we're all nerds here .-.
^
The reason I like it is because of the Borderlands style gameplay. HUGE monsters to fight with guns that shoot bullets that probably shoot bullets but you don't know until you find out.
AdamTheDuck: I know
I'm a muffin, not a nerd.
There is a difference.
/me eats Jmo then
No, I'm not a muffin for you to eat.
/me noms on Jmo's fish
/me puts Jmo on his shelf
Eat my fish, see if I care.
/me sees if he does care
/me eats Jmo's hidden, endless supply of large trout
Jmo: who says you cant make muffins out of nerds?
The biggest problem with the game is that the first hour or so is nothing but Clap Trap making bad jokes and being annoying.
Bacon[Hazard]: favorite gun in Borderlands 1 was a vulcan machinegun with infinite bullets dropped by a miniboss :D
Bacon[Hazard]: is that a bad thing?
^
It is.
we've already made cupecakes out of jocks Jmo
It's voice is extremely annoying.
Bacon[Hazard]: thats what clap trap is meant to do though
I like terrible jokes, and I've seen more annoying than Claptraps
MadSurge: ikr
MadSurge: ya like nazi jokes?
Bacon[Hazard] hi :3
But it goes on for an entire HOUR. Plus, adding to the problem, the next hour after that is more tutorials.
BD2 is like an MMO, you play it 'cause your friends are
What's up CCCP?
Bacon[Hazard] not much, you?
you know what i wish i could play right now? Star Wars Battlefront 2. god i miss that game
ohai CCCP
DoctoDoctorWho: if they're not too extreme... yes :O
Ranting about BL2.
FlutterMEDIC: indeed
hello cowvarkian
hi CCCP
Ohai CCCP
I have a horrible Holocaust joke. Who want's to hear it?
Nazies deserve nothing but mocking :D
Bacon[Hazard]: I do
MadSurge: I dunno, it can get to be a lolocaust with me:)
well, i have nothing better to do
hi FlutterMEDIC and AdamTheDuck
Okay, here it is: I met this guy a ltitle while back at a party. He was really nervous about something. So I asked him what was wrong. But you know what he did next?
How's life CCCP?
BEGIN THE LOLOCAUST!
Bacon[Hazard]: WHAT?
MadSurge ok :3
He made like an Anne Frank and split.
/me Throws himself into the chat
how have you been MadSurge?
accidental caps
hi Ponies47
Bacon[Hazard]: o u
Hello Ponies47!
I told you. It was terrible.
That's it?
/me is knocked down by Ponies47
Yes.
I didn't even crack a smile at that.
for nazi jokes to be fuunny you have to make them--horrrriible
CCCP: my ear is all healed up :$
Bacon[Hazard]: I get it.<_<>_>
/me licks Ponies47 .-.
Lets not make Nazi jokes guys, they're way out of Mein Kampfort zone
MadSurge :3 thats good to hear, what happend to it?
DoctoDoctorWho :|
DoctoDoctorWho: hah
He listened to too much dubstep.
CCCP: fungi inside it, my eardrum was the size of a marble ;~;
MadSurge oh dear :s

16 gig RAM, upgradable to 24, nvidea gefirce gtx 690m and a quad core i7m processor
Thunder_Crescent, we no Italiano
Serenity: nice
16 gig RAM?
WHY
SO MANY
For the low low low price of £1,500
CrimsonPhoenix: why not
._. im not italian
16 is a bit overkill isn't it?
CrimsonPhoenix: Because Sony Vegas
Also 3d modelling
cowvarkian, it's too much for no- oh
How much does Sony Vegas take?
good lord
You can use anything for Vegas
05proper 3D software requires quite a bunch for high end modelling
05and or rendering
But if you have pisstonnes of RAM for vegas, the rendering turns out quite well
Wrek: Yeah, a computer of the caliber I'm getting will still take ages to render a 30 sec 3d piece
daaaaaaang
How I hate 3d so much :P
AdamTheDuck: Did sonny Start Streaming yet?
Serenity: hmm
and only 6 are needed for gaming computer

hey guys, who is ok with computers here?
Danke sehr sumi :)
true
d3rb: what do you mean by ok??
computers? pff, i never use a computer
well, who has half an idea about computers, RAM specifically
d3rb: ME
d3rb: i always use this site
d3rb: www.downloadmoreram.com
i'm here on my toaster
lols
what you need to do is delete system 32
just kidding of course
^
then alt f4?
cachi01: You always show your ram
:P
what do you need more ram for?
everything
more ram the merrier
then buy a new ram stick and put it in your tower
if your computer can't be modified like that then tough luck
floof
you can increase the allocation of virtual memory on your pc if you have the space for it
anyway, whats werid is igot more ram yesterday. went from 4gb to 6 (meant to be 8 but one stick is dead, warranty) anyway...
/me random cupcakez fanfic
FUUUUUUUUU
d3rb: imo 6 is ok
/me punches fanfic
500 ping, 0.2 up, 0.05 down, and that's to comcasts own goddamn speedtest server here in the metro
why do you need that much ram though? are you trying to play crysis on max hardware settings or something?
whats weird is that i used to manage with 4, usually when using a few apps, usually had 800mb free....now doing the exact same stuff with more ram...i have only 1 gig free
But at least steam made it into offline mode
Test
TheMaster, sai paint uses 2 gig atm
Hello.
I'm back, what did I miss? .-.

Dark92Enigma-: so I saw
Dark92Enigma, ghost command is your friend.
Dark92Enigma, should've name yourself Dark92Enigmo
o > a
still no guage?
cachi01: por cierto, yo opino que la 2nda temporada va a empezar con la boda
TESTING
nope
>.>
Puta.
brb, returning plate
nope didn't work again
Dark92Enigma: si. hay rumores de eso
espero que no
pero yo creo que es por razones de publicidad por eso del juguete de cadance
Chef: "Oh girl...the shit you shit and shit and shit."
cachi01: lo mas probable es que Hasbro quiera aprovecharse del MARKETING
si exacto
so, how about those spanish speaking nations
ikr
cachi01: y no solo eso, Maggie Vera anuncio en Twitter que terminaron con la grabacion de la boda
I'm getting something about hasbro commercials and marketing
sorry.....we're going PM now
Dark92Enigma-: or you could speak in english
that'd work too
Dark92Enigma-: si eso si lo vi
Hi all
cowvarkian: sorry :(
ShiningArmor225: hey
hello ShiningArmor225
hi ShiningArmor225
Dark92Enigma-: y la voz de derpy es la misma de hermione en latino :D
Dark92Enigma-: its fine, I just want to know what you two are saying too >.>
Hi ShiningArmor225 :)
hi ShiningArmor225 :)
Hai ShiningArmor225 :)
something about a harry potter character
cachi01: NO WAY!
Language discussion can be done in PM
How are you all? :)
don't be a dick
Hello ShiningArmor225
CrimsonPhoenix: or in english
CrimsonPhoenix: but whatever
cowvarkian: oh some things about the latin dub of MLP :)
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: latin, or spanish
cowvarkian, the point of them doing that is most likely private discussion
GoW3 Multiplayer has so much lag, I only play Horde now.
^
but that's dismissing the fact that we have a PM system
cowvarkian: latin spanish
Dark92Enigma-: lolwut
gotta go, dinner time
Bye Dark92Enigma-
cya Dark92Enigma- :)
MASF123: I have not played geats of war 3 in ages :P
Bye Dark92Enigma- :)
later Dark92Enigma-
CrimsonPhoenix: they weren't really talking about anything private though, just talking about something but in spanish
fakin tickers they are killing me on hordemode
Yeah I know the damn multi is broken don't blame you.
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: Want a hand? :3
but, tickers are cute ;3;
^
:D
MLP_Brovakiin: gold just run out sorry :$
cachi01|GearsOfWar3 Are you on hardcore or Insane?
insane
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: Damn :P
OMFG
MASF123: what
They kill you instantly.
I played it on insane once, it is not that hard :P
then this rule is relevent

I played GoW3 Horde like yesterday with Squeekasqueek's friends.
so how about those topics of conversation
>finally catch up on last few days of eqd
>scroll up chat and see new drawfriend post
fffff

sprukls :D

twilight_sprinkle: how do you know it isnt

dat snowing
brb
twilight_sprinkle: Pffft, I've not caught up since June. *That* would be hard work. XD
twilight_sprinkle, eye color is wrong
lies CrimsonPhoenix
the show was srong
wrong*
GilDash: i actually have 2 months i havent caught up on yet >.>
Other than the the technics are interesting especially the hair
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, I've got over 4. Your point is invalid. :p
seems like something so simple can be made good
i dont really care about eye color
42 is the meaning of life.
GilDash: fair enough
d3rb: or she could be wearing contacts when she has red eyes
42 is a good number
d3rb: so both eye colors are correct
yep, im fine with that theory
God: I was you once
I was jesus once too
twilight_sprinkle: I might start again once S3 starts and there's not so many spoilers flinging around, but I doubt I'll go into the archives.
and buddha
I love it when the show disturb fanon stuff
Then he reincarted as a cow.
CrimsonPhoenix: you're welcome
reincarnated
Moooooo
CrimsonPhoenix: we always find a way around it
only 5 more days
I can't wait to see the reactions when rainbow dash will have a crush on a guy
lolwat
for Season 3, God? :O
yes
GilDash: i'll probably just try to catch up during vacation
CrimsonPhoenix: what, you mean we'll have our fanon dreams crushed that she's a lesbian?
then everyone will say she's Bi
twilight_sprinkle: Vacation? Wazzat? XD
lesbians are hot
^
Scootanon: >_>
cowvarkian, tihng is most fans are never happy when things doesn't go their way
Lesbiens can be dykes too which I don't like.
look at Derpy, Vinyl Scratch eyes, Dr whooves
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't give a fuck, I just make up some reason why it happened and then I'm fine with it
Yeah, those are worst ponies!
I even heard the Luna redesign cause a lot of uproar
WHat redesign?
I don't give a fuck either AND I go WITH THE SHOW
CrimsonPhoenix: whadda mean doctor whooves
CrimsonPhoenix, this sounds like spoilers
d3rb, what spoilers?
I like where this is going.
CrimsonPhoenix: I mean, I know about him, I just mean why are we angry
oh never mind, i read that wrong
CrimsonPhoenix: the RD x random pony from S3 rumors are fake
cowvarkian, Time Turner
CrimsonPhoenix: what about it
cachi01|GearsOfWar3 thank goodness
cachi01|GearsOfWar3, that's just a dumb guess base on some fandom facts
GilDash: what do you mean use
CrimsonPhoenix: the one that lauren faust posted
Marcus Fenix will not return in Judgement...or Dom. T_T
but she didnt
MASF123: prequel
lol
cachi01|GearsOfWar3, again I do not know what you're talking about
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: Ikr which sucks.
CrimsonPhoenix: wait, doctor whooves has an official name?
cowvarkian, it's Time Turner
/me WHAT IS THS PLACE FILLED WITH SO MUCH MISINFORMATION
Time turner
based on the cards
yet people still deny that and call him Doctor Whooves
CrimsonPhoenix: They had a rumor with RD having a boyfriend for Season 3 which is false.
CrimsonPhoenix: why should I care what hasbro calls him, I'll keep calling him what I want
MASF123, again it was a dumb guess I don't know anything about RD having a crush
SpeccyRush: A fandom. Get used to it. :p
CrimsonPhoenix: this is where the rumors started http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7o1tjgSZ11r72gu2o1_500.jpg
I just stated that cause I know RD being lesbian is commonly known has fanon
I'm calling it a night, cya everypony.
I would ship myself to another shipped female character. Lol.
/me likes straight dashie
>no galaxy girls signature
no wonder that's fake
/me agrees with SpeccyRush
GilDash: ah well that sucks
twilight_sprinkle: That's jobs for ya.
But yeah I just love it when fanon stuff gets crushed
Depends.
also DJ-Pon3 looks cuter with Magenta eyes
and if they give RD a boyfriend. her R34 wont be the same :(
The only fanon pairing I'd be miffed about losing is Lyra x Bon-Bon. Seriously, that's all I would really miss.
CrimsonPhoenix: The official name is Dr Hooves now, actually.
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: There will be no genitals shown in Season 3. :S
cachi01|GearsOfWar3: most unlikely
GilDash, College friends
aaaaaaand i got killed
Apparently Hasbro compromised with the fans on that one.
CriticKitten, I know about that WeLoveFine thing
(while still trying to dodge the obvious lawsuit)
MASF123: I just pretend they're there, but we don't see them :D
Pony pony should pony pony.
still BS
Actually I'm cool with it.
CrimsonPhoenix: Experimental college friends?
Time Turner is his name it's been in the card and that game
Nopony could pony two ponies to pony
GilDash, yeah wouldn't that be good?
Anyone read Rainbow Dash Academy
It's far more "iffy" than the Ditzy Doo / Derpy Hooves controversy.
MASF123, I follow it
Funny comic series.
Oh, ohai GilDash! :$
back from the best dinner i've had in years
CriticKitten: was that really a controversy
CrimsonPhoenix: As long as it's not stated otherwise, you can always keep the fanon going.
MadSurge: Holla! :)
Welcome back Dark92Enigma- :)
GilDash, I'm ok with that
Dark92Enigma-: what did you eat?
but when the show decide on something I expect the fans to follow it
cowvarkian: Still is. Many people insist they are different characters to this day, some in this channel. I just scoffed at it and moved on. :P
Welcome back Dark92Enigma-
CrimsonPhoenix: I read that whole thng from beginning to end yesterday, I feel upset no more is made until later. :(
and not deny with some bullshit reason
CriticKitten: hmm
so what have you been up to Dark92Enigma
fucking THICKEEEEEEERS
MASF123, welcome to every webcomic ever in the world
CrimsonPhoenix: Nah, I can't be arsed with that. I'd be disappointed, but it's hardly world ending or something.
Thank you for your sarcasm.
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352157633461.jpg you wake up in the middle of the night and see this...
MASF123, no I'm serious all of the webcomic it's like that
MadSurge: a sandwich, a piece of Dutch cake (that i bought) and some tea
So, I have a choice. Responsible adult who grades his students' quizzes, or total slacker who takes the rest of tonight off, having just spent lots of time prepping a test. >_>
You get hooked
Bronysith: a 4chan logo?
Bronysith: ask her how she is doing
CrimsonPhoenix: I know. I've been put in that situation before.
then in the span of a day you finish the whole thing and then you sit there
'bout 50-50 on this one, gotta admit.
and ask yourself
now what
It's 4chan, NOT clicking it.
alexxm: it couldn't get any better bro----wait, MONDAY NIGHT RAW, OF COURSE!
alexxm: i'm gonna watch it online
CriticKitten: Go and mark those papers. As a former student who had the slackiest teacher ever, they will make your life hell if you don't get them their marks on time. :p
but where was I
Oh yeah GilDash I like how you think about the whole fanon vs canon
But they're all gonna suck. ;_;
cowvarkian: so, we were talking about S2 premiering with the WEDDING episode instead of the one with DISCORD
Bronysith: watch out for that extra s in the http, it gives 4chan leech messages
Return of Harmony
Dark92Enigma-: oh yeah
And I'll get all depressed and stuff when half the kids get terrible grades,
*.
also I hate it when the show pander to fans with stuff
But fyne.
I'm so fresh you can suck these nuts, I'm so fresh you can suck these nuts.
CrimsonPhoenix: It just makes sense. Why moan about what's clearly there for all to see? The fun in fanon is explaining what is unexplained and what you *don't* see.
11,01Hi.
ello everypony :$
GilDash, exactly
Sorry that song is stuck in my head.
A MOD
Nittany_Discord: hello aniki

OMG SPOILERZ GAWD
I enjoy those where's Derpy thingies
Discord gets pregnant with Screwball in S3.
well, disney will own everyone
but the call that voice and the whole travesty after the edite
yeah
Nittany_Discord: That would be a MAJOR TWIST......by the way, it's my birthday
Rainbow-Dash: There's a little thing called antitrust, they can't buy everything
Disney has Sonic now. D: and Marvel.
MadSurge: for now
08,01Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome starts on Fridaty!
it shows how kind and "TOLERABLE" MLP fans are
11,01Happy Birthday Dark92Enigma-
08,01i'm SO FRAKKING EXCITED!
Haven't you heard?
so in conclusion
NO. NO TO DISNEY BUYING HASBRO.
CriticKitten: don't we have anti trust laws?
DJ-PON3's eyes are magenta
EH no.
deal with it
cowvarkian: How long do you expect that to last?
CriticKitten: not awfully long
CriticKitten: Im just pointing it out.
I mean, we already have corporations recognized legally as PEOPLE.
G2G Rage Quit on Bronystate.
See you all later! /)
Only a matter of time before they demand the same rights as people.
08,01GilDash: on Machinima.com
08,01it's a 10-part webseries
Like the right to buy stuff.
Which is totally a right, didn't you know?
Bye mas- gone
08,01GilDash: it looks REAAAAALLY COOL
08,01check out the trailer
08,01anyone streaming at the moment?
nope

Forward unto Dawn?
They wrote it in some obscure part of the Constitution, right next to various other clauses that don't exist.
Because tht series is MLG~
:D
08,01wait, isn't sumi streaming a film?
Scoot-Scootaloo: nope. some battlestar galactica thing
08,01or did that already happen?
Um, there isn't anything going on about Disney buying Hasbro in the news, is there?
He's streaming in half an hour
Kandarihu: yes
Kandarihu: didn't we just bring that up?
Kandarihu: they also bought valve
Kandarihu: and they also bought bronystate
O_o disconnected
Hey guys
if Disney buys Hasbro
Hello CrimsonPhoenix
we go insane?
MLP in Kingdom Hearts anyone?
cachi01|GearsOfWar3, whatever. You're just trolling me.
Crimson: I find that unlikely.
CrimsonPhoenix: pinkie as a support? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
CrimsonPhoenix: That would be cool
There we go
CriticKitten: I do as well
ughhhhh
unlikely but still positive thoughts
also Disney Quality MLP movie?
Mmh?
Now, cameos from Star Wars characters? Oh, that's gonna happen
Disney does do a few great things - releasing SatAM sonic on dvd some 6 or 7 years ago
CrimsonPhoenix: >.> disney quality has sortof gone down
CrimsonPhoenix: uhmmm 3D pony models never look good. lol
cachi01|GearsOfWar3, you might be surprised
Ew, Disney-made ponies.
I like the idea of SW 7
hell, Sonic SatAM is back on my country
I sense a fear of re-design
You want the same people who bungled the fricking POWER RANGERS in charge of your ponies?
Power rangers was never good
Better rethink that.
you now like Power Rangers because of Nostalgia
08,01gimme a sec
CrimsonPhoenix: it was cheesy fun
It was always cheesy, absolutely. And they still made it WORSE.
the original Power Rangers KICKED ASS IMO
MadSurge, and repetitive
That's a fricking JOB to do.
CrimsonPhoenix: like a lot of sentai shows
hey everypony :)
Hai Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Hey Sketch_Toku_Brony!
When you take something that cheesy and manage to make it irredeemably bad, you dun goofed. >_>
The current ones? still good, but not enough
MadSurge, well yeah
duh
im back everypony :)
and Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
somepony talking bout Sentai/PR?
CriticKitten: AT least we can all agree that the Turbo movie SUCKED
and I've watched Wreck it ralph this saturday
how are things Sketch_Toku_Brony
it's was alright for a kids movie
alexxm good :)
Dark92Enigma-: turbo?
CriticKitten: you know that power rangers creator actually regained the rights to it in 2010
FUCKING TURBO
UGH
Im going to get some dinner :) bbs
MadSurge oh yeah heard about that
You have the magic of space crystals that literally always get stronger, AND YOU TRADE THEM IN FOR CARS
Y U SO DUMB
CrimsonPhoenix: I want to see it just for the game references :D
wreck it ralph was awesome
MadSurge, oh dear gosh
but the story itself isn't too bad
heck I Love Vaneloppe
i loved the references
CriticKitten: we went from MIND-BLOWING CGI in the 1st movie to......CARS?
Turbo was a train wreck, and that's saying something because Lightspeed was the series that brought in the train. :|
CrimsonPhoenix: ikr
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, I expect that too
Hi
CriticKitten: you know that disney bought it in 2001, right
Though in fairness, the Lightspeed MegaTrain was badass
CrimsonPhoenix: if it wasn't good the references wouldn't save it
CriticKitten: And back to the guy-in-a-suit as the Zorg
i was the only one at the cinema laughing at the references :I
MadSurge, true
Zord*
Hi Coal_Soul :)
no one else but me got them
though please be warned
it's predictable
then again
meow
kids movie so
sup Coal_Soul
CrimsonPhoenix: well duh
Nothing
CrimsonPhoenix: its a disney movie, of course its predictable
CriticKitten: I Mean, at least the original one had a decent design, but the one in turbo looks like a rejected mascot
but anyway yeah if Disney buys Hasbro it won't be too horrible
Everything about Turbo was a bloody fail
/me Gadgetmobile: Careful, wear your seatbelt.......IT'S A DISNEY MOVIE
EVERYTHING
but they better not mess with the show
Four more hours till SB gets back home. On them long road trips
CrimsonPhoenix:
SORRY
08,01everyone refresh your stream
From villain to heroes to fricking concept
08,01you should see LimeV
tab fail
Surely Disney is going to become a monopoly...
GilDash: oh, it will
CriticKitten: I agree.......
It was just BAD.
GilDash: maybe with a private army, and its own principalities
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
GilDash, they already becoming
It's there... and refusing to load.
it's like Google
Alright, then. We haven't had a stream all day
CriticKitten: Justin gets out of car. Adam "Rocky!? Dear god, your legs shrunk!"
remember when Google bought Youtube
OH THE REAcTIONS
Ah, here we go. Stupid laggy internet connection. >_<
08,01can you see it?
yes
I saw the terminal
<.<
I still say that Apple and Google will merge together
there it is
CrimsonPhoenix: that'd be interesting
it's only a matter of time
J_E_Smith71: But don't you see? The addition of a child character isn't forced at all! It's an attempt to make the series HIP and COOL and am I grating my teeth? Why yes I am
Okay. It's up.
CrimsonPhoenix: I would like that actually
CriticKitten: I know I was making fun of that scene
08,01HOW AWESOME WAS THAT?
08,01i think we need to see it agian
I wouldn't know, the stream died on me. :P
To be honest, I was never interested in the remade BSG. I avoided that for desecrating my childhood.
CriticKitten: If the stream didn't start I was about to post a funny parody script of the movie that mocks it
cowvarkian, and they'll be called something like Goople
08,01maybe i should loop it for the next 15 minutes until sumi comes on...
CrimsonPhoenix: or something like gapple
cowvarkian, what sounds better Gapple or Goople?
08,01youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj50xJhWdcM
Gapple Goople that's a funny word to say
This looks like it's back when Adama was a pilot. Awesome.
What the heck is this ._.
Sorry, *fracking* awesome.
CrimsonPhoenix: neither sound good, if they do merge they would probably create some awesome name
And why does it remind me of a video game?
CrimsonPhoenix: or some really silly name like goople
GHOST STORIES, please.......
cowvarkian, well google is silly already so
So... gotta keep my eyes peeled for that.
and I kinda like goople
please be Ghost Stories, please be Ghost Stories
so is there a stream
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, but if you actually know what google means, then it makes sense
Goople
Not Ghost Stories
alexxm: FINALLY! THE ROCK HAS COME BACK TO THE STREAM!
Dark92Enigma-: >_>
like I would go "Hey have you seen my new Goople 5 it's azmaing with high def 2160p with 3D and stuff
Look I can play angry birds

CrimsonPhoenix: on that
huh what

o.o

Oh man this guy again
cowvarkian, oh that's nice....but can you play farmville?
Dark92Enigma: That works too ;)
So I'm reading that this guy lathered his crotch in IcyHot
08,01it's black comedy
CrimsonPhoenix: because crysis would be so out dated that it would be mere childsplay, and come preinstalled on every smart phone
cowvarkian, ok but...
can you
Finally, living daylight! (Or rather a stream, at long last...)
CrimsonPhoenix: yes
play farmville?
Because I'm pretty sure that's how someone would react to that
CrimsonPhoenix: I can play farmville
cowvarkian, GIMME THAT PHONE
CrimsonPhoenix: >_>
Oshit my crops are ready
CrimsonPhoenix: yes... this is what the future would be like
look at my HIGH DEF CROPS
gapple unlimited
instead of iPhone
it would be gPhone
I wonder which monopoly will own a country first
gPad
gMac
wat
alexxm: what

Corporate empires owning countries? Sounds vaguely cyberpunkish...
what
GilDash: sounds vaguely realistic
GilDash, well cyberpunk is the future so
Wat.

CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, I just used wikipedia
11,01There are anti-trust laws in the US, but I'd hate to see them overturned (and our pro-corporate Supreme Court could do it).
I didn't even need wikipedia

Buytoast: And then the Eagle cried when the british invaded in the War of 1812, thus creating the rivers and rain that drvoe away them nasty redcoats
Nittany_Discord: good luck with that
Damn right.
11,01We could be Greece or Iran.

so it's a tradition now to stream V for Vendetta?
cause I know the first year was a lucky pick
or WAS IT
CrimsonPhoenix: it was probably rigged
is it a Bill Nye where he burns down someone who says he's wrong?
But then the eagle reincarnated as Abraham Lincoln and put a stop to the feud!
CrimsonPhoenix: knowing this place
cowvarkian, you're really getting under my skin

00,10ah I see MIPS is dead again, joy
08,01disney buying Hasbro, that is
"oh shit really?" "yea...in the head" "Roger that"
Sumica, but it's only Monday
wait so
if Disney buys Hasbro
IT IS TIME THAT THE EMPIRE BE OVERTHROWN. BRONIES, TO ARMS!!
there will be no more Bronycons or any convention at all?
08,01i've heard that there's some major restructuring goign on in Hasbro internally
...
[SWAG]Haku: i cant let you do that starfox
I'm neutral about this
05So i heard we had a badass in here...
[SWAG]Haku: I for one am compliant with our eminant evil overlords
00,10reftesh
Well, I guess the good point: My Little Pony in Kingdom Hearts (...Seriously...Sora as a pony...wat?). The bad point? You guys decide.
IDW will possibly lose lots of it's publications..
Badass? .-.
This must be a call from the Mayans...
<.<
08,01wait... disney own Marvel?
yeah
I WAS OK WITH DISNEY BUYING STAR WARS, BECAUSE DISNEY NEVER MAKES BAD MOVIES, BUT I WILL NOT LOVE NOR TOLERATE THEM BUYING HASBRO
No. I will not wait for you
08,01Wrek: my ass is particularly bad
[SWAG]Haku, >tolerate
Hi
d3rb: in soviet russia?
Wrek define badass
HERE WE GO
wat the fuck
nope, they just own everyone
IN SOVIET RUSSIA, WE OWN DISNEY
d3rb: oh.... ok
00,10keep tellen yah they will buy hasbro so they can make a live action "ultimate showdown of ultimate destany"
[SWAG]Haku: thats because its a socialist economy
Disney is getting all commie towards Hasbro >: (
I'm quite worried about this myself. Disney's strict copyright enforcement will certainly turn against us.
Sumica, i'm ok with that
oh hell yeah
Sumica they lack godzilla
Oh my
V for Vendetta
or they own that too ?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: they'll get it
they will buy godzilla
IN WASNT USUD MADE BUY THE GUY WHO MADE THE POTTER PUPPET PALS?
Sumica, i will have your children... OVER TO MY KIDS BIRTHDAY PARTY! because i wub that youre playing this movie <3
They also lack PBS. No Mr Rogers
The question if Disney does buy Hasbro will they go back on being supportive of the Brony community?
OH YEAH, MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK BYT HE WAY
AGAIN
actually no, disney will just buy japan
If it means better quality pony toys, I'm for it.
Kandarihu: I'm sure they'll acquire it
00,10it's ok Godzilla is owend by a company with no US holdings they can in fact make it with out their OK
Tovler: me too
We are Leeejun lolol
Remember, remember the 5th of November .-.

AdamTheDuck: Yeah, that ended 6 minutes ago in its country of origin. :p
AW SHIT HERE WE GO
a spanish anarchist...
But if Disney buys PBS, they already own ABC.
WE R ANONYMOOSE, WE R LE GUN
did someone said
anarchy?

Oh look, it's Bill O'Reilly.
Buytoast, get out
I have released my caps lock!
ALLELUJAH
Many lives were lost, blood shed everywhere

Hey guys, if Disney DID get to buy Hasbro, good news!
sumica, what is your lifes dream?
Disney NEVER makes bad movies, but they DO make bad shows
Buytoast: WE DU NUT FURRGI

VenHur but I want to see the Dnobots...
Well, maybe it's Glenn Beck instead.
VenHur, no more HORRIBLE Trnformers movie
05the movie itself is really rather good in itself
Wrek: SPOILED fricking idiots... ._.
NO IM RIGHT HERE I DONT LIVE IN THE SKY U IDIOT
05so if dinseys bad movies still are good
Glenn Beck isn't an anarchist, though
i live in a house like everyone else

CriticKitten why head not body? Torso is bigger and moves less
08,01nooo! hugo weaving!
He also took about a million bullet hits.
08,01so yeah
That guarantees the kill even if the target is wearing body armor.
08,01apparently
nuuu!~
08,01Britain is a virus. *wears sunglasses*

"V, please stop bleeding"? Did she really say that?
Sumica, the new IOTB is good for 12 hits in seperate locations from 7.76 rounds
Maybe ^^
2 hits in the same spot with the same amunition

She said lets stop the bleeding... I think....

"Oh, you don't want me to die from these inner bleedings? okay, woman, that is how science works."

And Michael Bay was found incapacitated in his seat and was immediately rushed to the hospital.

SHE WAS DEAD.
If it does turn into a landslide victory for Mitt Romney, and the media starts claiming that Romney stole the election, would you believe the claim?

:|

GOD I LOVE THIS MOVIE

Never has taking off masks and hats been so epic Minaj~

They're all the people killed by the regime.
Let's do it again!

After watching Southland Tales, Branded, and Cosmopolis, this movie feels like a masterpiece.

05i have if favored somewhere on youtube but CBA to fetch it
/me gangnam styles more with [SWAG]Haku and passes out sunglasses
I can't wait for this election to end.
who is ready for season 3
13Kandarihu: tends to happen, you learn to filter it out
we all know twilight_sprinkle loves gangnam style :3
Bronysith: why, what properties of the song make it so excellent?
05Kandarihu: nope doesnt matter casue you didnt bring up fox, its whoever did bring up fox started in not you
anyways, besides all the sudden hatred for fox news, who's ready to vote tomorrow?

Shizuka, I can no longer filter out this sort of hate from my mind than bullets from my chest if I were shot.
first past the post
Makes me sad. I was hoping for a full on lefty for the 2016 election. but the dems will pull to the right as always.
twilight_sprinkle: oh u :D
I was ready when season 2 ended
[SWAG]Haku: i get to do the part with the elevator XD
Sorry, but Gangnam Style is INCREDIBLY overrated IMO.
Im not voting lol
Er, no more filter
08,01Chrysalis: very true
I never miss a chance to vote and urge everyone here of age to do it.
Minah~
rather than proper proportional representation
Wrek dunno, you're kinda from out of country
08,01Chrysalis: for starters FPTP is ridiculous
this is the first time I can, but its a terrible choice
dat BBc
13innit though
05Princess: lessen the "Minah~" spam, thank you.
00,10whats this about Faux news? =p
Kandarihu: Mer? All I said was that Fox has already begun writing a narrative should Obama be re-elected. As has NBC for Romney's election. They're both doing it >_>
and 3rd parties will stay invisible until 8 month before the election as always.
13worse still i think is winner take all states
mmkay :(
FPTP is the larger parties ensuring the smaller ones dont get a chance
08,01Shizuka: iseewutudidthar
eyjey u r gud :>
11,01Why can't US news being truly unbiased?
Nittany_Discord because 'murica
13i know why, 24 hour cycles
11,01And it's not just Fox.
CriticKitten, yeah. I guess you're right.
05there is no such thing as complete unbias
/me Romney all way, Obama can go eat a dick
Nittany_Discord: cause biased makes the world go round
08,01Nittany_Discord: come live in scotland
Nittany: Because our country fails. >_>
13it gets filled with opinion shows
05but there is mroe bias and less bias
Negative News actually helps people learn more about politics than without negative news
Nittany_Discord: Because the purpose of TV news is ratings, not to inform.
08,01we have more interesting weather here
08,01it's not better
whem did politics get here?
08,01but it's mroe interesting.

I like the song though.
08,01Wrek: correct answer
Which would explain why I'm such a prick. Ba-dum tish
Would there be any way we could get it popular again?

Meanwhile: Such as EQLA three times
someone has had too much time on their hands...
[SWAG]Haku: glee is going to cover this song
And the network that this channel is on is basically dead
this is fantastic
Oppai Gangnam Style is still my favorite
fun fact, this guy couldnt advance past freshman for 4 years in college and ended up failing it
I can't help but feel like I'm missing why this is funny.
That feel when you danced to this with all your cousins last night. True story.
Im so confused.
They play Gagnam Style on the in house music in my freaking gym.
Bronysith, Oh GOD WHAT?
We could always try the Facebook account and wasn't there a YouTube account someone made, too?

This is an intersting video to come back to.
superretroworld: not really..

TheKatPony: same here :/ i hate dance parties xd
I could make a video for the chat if you wanted. And I'm pretty sure if we got some people spreading the word it would get popular fast.

I heard this on the radio the other day.
This song is "Meh" to me, and the fact that it's INCREDIBLY overplayed doesn't make me like it any better.

11,01I normally don't like Pop, but I do like this song.
I didn't mind this song, then it got overplayed to HELL
To all of you complaining about the popularity of this song: Would you like to go back to Hannah Montana and Justin Bieber?
It was cool at first, now it's just overrated.

Yeah, some more videos would be great
Lol, yup
^^
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay sexy AJ :D
twilight_sprinkle: true that. but i stiil like it >.<
08,01i only like this song because it's kinda like dubstep
I thought this song would be as popular as Gee from Girl Generation
Lol dat kick

i hated this song before it was overplayed
?
Man, Party in the USA was awful.

I meant to do a lot more with those accounts
It wasn't even really cool to me. I just found it meh.
>kinda like dubstep
Well arent YOU edgy, hipster_sprinkle.

Yeah, I'll record a video for it tommorow. Second quarter starts tommorow, so I have to turn in in like a minute..
But summer ended and I got really busy with school
