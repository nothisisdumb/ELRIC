It's going up! :D
yup it is
daft punk
00,02you'd think something with soo may control srufaces would be... controllable
FUCK PHYSICS
it's a pinkie pie ship
00,02Chrysalis, its up here
refresh now
it's up
yeah just came back up
00,02but yeah
00,10not if you roll it
00,02true
00,02plus its got tonns of fuel
00,02not controllable unfortunately
00,02Sumica, aparently its not working
00,10odd how it can float but as soon as you roll it on it's centerline it drops like well it shoud
00,02i'm climbing still
00,10no the roll controlls
00,02no, falling now
00,02climbing again

/me is up before the Celestia
this peice has been out of the swam for hours...
and killing kerbals
once I got it stable
11,01Going to try and sleep now.
see you
WOOOOOOOO
,_,
00,10I can see alot of this guys problem
00,10rcs on and full throdel
00,02i went through that stage though
00,02now i know how to build rockets
._. i failed
00,02"*version was before struts were introduced*"
00,02MASF123, 16 GB "{
00,02:P'
I on;y have 256MB....VERY LAGGY Lol
256 ram
yeah 256MBs of RAM
should be decent
plus it's like £40 for 4gb of DDR
3
00,02256 is really not enough for modern os'
00,02os's
256 is tiny
no I mean 4 gbs
is decent
not mine.
00,02hmmm
00,02no, nvm
00,02its all good
I have 6 gb of DDR3 in this, but my GPU is meh and my CPU in mid end
plus I'd really like more RAM
but this MB can only take 8GB tops
where do you go to bye more ram
like at ofice depot or something'
more a tech shop
00,02hmmm
or order online
process
as a unit
...
Maybe
Can I upgrade them?
are you on a mac
And the bios likes it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor
X3
I balme my comp sci history there
00,02cow334, after music
lol that bunnymustard
the gpu draws it to the screen
ok
a CPU is the thing that dose all THE THINGS
most of the things
no no
more or less ALL
things like physics are moving to the GPU now as well
theres even some AI routines built for GPUs
or dedicated PPUs
LAWL
but the CPU still passes them along
no one uses those any more
PhysX was a nice idea
just not in a desktop for home use
depends on how you define them
etc
not quite
massivly parrallel computation chips
00,02rocket seems legit
dude that's the simple and "wrong" version but yeah
Random Acess Memory
00,02'virtual memory' refers to something else
00,02ram is volatile
... :(
virtual memory is a file on the harddrive to trick the computer into thinking it has more ram
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_gifs/4026930/uhuahuahua/
00,02it requires the computer to be on to exist
00,02i think its going up
GPGPUs are the way forward though
won't run any "real" OS
Wuut.
00,02somehow i havent exploded
basicly
it's a GPU that can do other math
00,02operating systems generally depend on a 'mmu'
it also heats his flat
00,02gpu's dont have it due to performance reason
00,02plus the instruction sets on gpu's are tuned to the kind of work they do
I am looking for more ram for my computer
00,02altimiter gave uop
00,02up'
you try to bother the order of how it runs
00,02Chrysalis, not really afaik
but it's somethign like 6 500s
00,02watch
i mean the way its all laid out
00,02in a sec
00,02Chrysalis, well thats the mask
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027918/There+is+no+sugar+on+the+rape+cake/
IMHO yeah just
00,02it'll speed up as i move away from the parts
but it's more or less level
00,02there we go
with each having their quirks
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/342/085/17c.jpg
yeah
many seem to prefer nvidia cards for gaming though
NVIDIA chips are a PITA to code for
/me glances longingly to his framed Voodo 3
(fist Graphics card I saved up for my self)
IIRC
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/283/635/900.png
00,02i broke the altimiter
and i think i know where my old p1 is
00,02i've got a dual cpu p2 board around here
00,02cant get it to boot but its here
...
and this 64kb of raw POWER

00,02testing this as a parachute replacment
I really hope that at some point we get an epic Labyrinth 2-parter. Though I guess the Ssn2 premier stole the whole maze-thing's thunder
But, y'know, a 2-parter devoted to a Bowie-movie-reference
my tast in music is a "intresting"
00,02there we go
00,023KM/s
accel?
:P
00,02thats a good entry speed
well ok got to go
00,02need to see how this works
3KM/s-1 would be how many g
00,02XD
00,02it works
00,02new parachute design found
00,02lots of canards
....
00,02that was a re-entry
00,02tSparx, spaceships
Yep
i knew
00,02damned thing is climbing
Hey everypony
is that ship heading anywhere in particular?
wut?
Yes, I'm back again
00,02tSparx, its heading..... here
00,02kinda floats around
wait I can't work that out I lack a mass...
PYSICS DERP
http://funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/4027713/Pewds/
I wasw going to work out the G 3KM/s^-1 would be
but you need a mass
FM=A
and all
D.E.D
,_,
yep yep
Squalalaaaa
00,02spaceship is still floating
nice
dat altitude
Heh, yeah
00,02i dont know how but this thing is pulling 15 g's
I have it until Thursday
X3
ouch
15g
poor piolts
00,02ah
I don't think you ship is safe for organics
not sure if Saturn knows yet, but I'm coming for him >;3
or most mecianical things stb
00,02Dumori, its not safe
00,02infact it should have exploded
00,02several times
00,02it did explode once
?
00,02<<< look at stream
I can't
00,02"The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. The request to this fragment failed. "
plus I'm trying to "code"
00,0224.5G
horizontaly
Hi everypony :)
UMG, U BRAEOK IT
not quite
you can hold 17g in the right orientation for a while
Actually, that G at a constant rate should kill you
Quickly
in fact 25g is survile able
it has been survied
i think the highest g-force bearable over periods of time is somehwere at 10? with 9 being the safety-limit for combat pilots?
It's 10, yes
but 12 for a minuet shoudl be no lasting damage for most healthy people
the rest depends on orientation
and it's effect on blood flow
3*
:/
I've hit 5-6 once IIRC
no no healthy just horizontally
not vertically
what's that song called anyway?
horizontally it's much more constant across th ebody
00,02Jmo, i was wondering
00,02cow334, no
o.o
00,02i've got lots of crates already :(
I sold my HHHH for 3 keys :3
00,02no one wants them
^ You'll be amazed
i have crates. anybody wanna?
00,0215 or 20
i have a lot of creates
Tf2?
12 if faceing the other way
00,02Serenity, i think they want keys
00,02if you want the crates you can have
00,02cow334, no real favorite
Mine's the Soldier and Snaipah
00,02soldier'
00,02^
night yall
I'm not a bad sniper at time
that's just shameful
its the one thing that bugs me about MvM
after a couple rounds
Have a fav but still play what's needed
or you waste too many fund
Yeah, in MvM, we have like 4 snipers
00,02Chrysalis, i know the feel
00,02you know whats really fun?
00,02going all engie
00,02and winning
^ Pah, weakling
all engie MVM
play the tf sniper like any other hitscan
Welcome nameless pony!
00,02all engie mvm? i'm up for it
don't thing you're sniping
I rape advanced difficulty with Soldier ;)
i suppose i could try an all enig match
widowmaker is NASTY on MvM
00,02assuming it doesnt explode mid way
00,02Dumori, ikr!
00,02penetrating shots + field of heavys = DOOMED HEAVYS
they'll spend the whole round running away from a buster
ahahaha
that's beautiful
00,02rocket is normally less stable than this
griefing is always fun
00,02lag is making it more stable
00,02Serenity, XD
00,02Serenity, you know mannworks?
Course I do
Done it like 5 times
00,02Serenity, know the brown building?
00,02with stairs on the side?
Yeah, the one in the middle?
huh
theres a near completion on this server
Where do I recognize that pig noise from?
Oooh, that's the beginning to Animals
00,02it insta explodes off the map
Er, Pigs
Lolwut
off Animals
That's...silly
/me wants to play MvM now...
Well, I would play TF2
And my laptop isn't here
Dat intermittent music
00,02not sure why thats happening
Deadspace pretty much
you lost soemthing
00,02Vordox, yeah
00,02heard all these songs many times
It's Atmospheric Music
Think we all say around 70 pieces come off :3
00,02MIGHT be able to land this thing
00,02but its not easy
Now brb, because I'm hungry
Best JRPG i've played <3 Star Ocean 2, nothing have beaten it yet
00,02yeah, not enough power for the mun
Enjoy school
00,02re-enter
It's 5:55am. I have school tomorrow.
00,02i wanted to reach the mun but that failed
00,02after this might try for all-engie mvm
Just let it drop then? :P
Well... today.
Well, gratz, I think you've signed up for no sleep.
I'll play mvm all egin
00,02Vordox, its not really my kind of thing
00,02space jrpg i assume
00,02hmmm
00,02lets just let it re-enter for now
Halo doesn't really mix with kerbals getting exploded and murdered
No. overused
Bumblebee
TTGL OST
The DDR "Bumblebee" or the classical "Flight of the Bumblebee"?
00,02Vordox, ?
just play some Spanish Flea
Whee!
Theme song for Kerbals.
ooh, my favy!
Yes
Awww yeah
Just. Yes
00,02first thing i've ever made capable of controled descent
"And let's not forget the Turbodrive!"
00,02theres the instability
wow that's shaking more than an eskimo with parkinsons
lol
woot woot
Looks like it's not actually falling anywhere
00,02i'm staying in the one spot
00,02this is getting us nowhere
lol
Haha
blow him up
he knew the risks
00,02parachute is all wierd
Or can you get it to straighten out for a moment?
00,02i think thats actually the direction we're moving
00,02also i think we are gaining altitude
lol
lol, This seems oddly fitting. XD
That very unfitting music...
lol
This is actually kinda fitting in a strange way
lol
00,02Vordox, :3
He broke physics
This music is going to be fitting for a few seconds.
"Eventually"
Maybe
00,02aeiou
Can't you make it become still?
i still say you should blow it up
Snake! Snake! SNAAAAAAAKE!
And now it's gaining attitude
:D
00,02the parachute's angle looks soo strange
lol]
00,02Gold_Demona, that would explain a lot
00,02MegaMoonShine, its on VERY low
00,02plus the engine itself is like farting
00,02doesnt move much
most annoying built ship ever =P
OH I KNOW
!
We HAVE PARACHUTE
Also, dat Star man theme XD
Kinda...
Woop
It'll provide enough drag to straighten it out.
lol!
lol
00,02soo much music request
00,02also the parachute broke
HOW DID IT BREAK!?
00,02right now i'm straight up hovering
it'll never end
00,02yeah
00,02as i said
00,02bug
Hello, nameless pony!
Wow...
XD
Would have done it faster, bleh
Can't you break off the wings somehow?
alright now it's just fucking with you
00,02cant spin
00,02the damned thing is stable
Oh no wait, you're facing up
00,02tSparx, i could
00,02i could detatch and fall
00,02but that would kill...
00,02'Edbin'
Oh no, poor "Named" Kerbals
:D
00,02real problem is i broke the altimiter
00,02Vordox, 'Pinkie Pie'
....Makes sense
BWAHAHAHA YES
LOL That explains everything!
00,02i'ma go get some food
Well, maybe he'll live.

Dramatic music is dramatic

and suddenly free power
00,02Dumori, is it a 0.16 craft?
Oh
.`5
00,02i found one for 0.15 on the fourms
That. Fucking. Boss. The improsoned
00,02ah
.15
it might still work in .16
not tryed
00,02its not falling
The Legend of Groose
00,02this craft is hovering
I know but I've nto tryed
00,02as in its not losing altitude
00,02average altitude anyway
00,02and its gaining speed
00,02Dumori, thats just it
00,02it isnt
it's a orhocopter
00,02sas is of
00,02off'
00,02i'm not touching any controlls
well phases ship broke physics

R.I.P. Edbin. :<
00,02sooo
00,02two plans
00,02Gold_Demona, he broke the laws of physics
lol
xD
Only Pinkie Pie may legally break physics
00,02pinkie pie is not legally alowed
00,02they've just never managed to catch her
lol
^^das^^
00,02now
00,02two plans
00,02a: all engie MvM
00,02if we can organize 6 players
00,02b: Amnesia
ill be up for mvm
i'd mvm

and i
00,02that was fast
*buh da boom, ching*
00,02that is terrifying
00,02or is
00,02either way, guns of icarus would be fun
00,02tSparx, thats a script
they finally added parties
Bots took our jobs
00,02i meen yes and no, not now at least
Hehe
I've only played like 3 maps out of the 6 ones.
00,02Serenity, already completed all engie on it
Play SNAIPAH then
Hide in the brown house, and you win
Umg, Ballooniorn
00,02nyx;
i'm connecting
00,02Serenity, i opened a bunch of crates, two of them were balloonicorns
00,02kept one, gifted the other
OHHHH you were not talking about actually crates earlier, haha

Everytime you launch the shuttle - photoalbum.

Hallo nameless pony!
pirates and ponies somebody fund it
*isn't
done
I already threw $20 at my screen
but the cash machines were all empty :(
There's a minimum age on credit cards? Huh.
I always liked debit cards more than credit cards anyway.
credit cards are a TERRIBLE idea
i'm too lazy for either
there is no advantage of a CC that an overdraft doesnt match
parents*
the transaction is declined
rather than getting charged for borrowing
or with 2 friends
they think i'll waste all the cash on ponies. "waste", peh, whadda they know?
theyv done it all before

AW YEAH
oh
AW FREAKING YEAH
See >:3
aww yeah
I have no sound from stream.
aww cute kittens
Is there any sound?
Guys, it's being sorted
I hear nothing
11,01Shizuka doesn't have a desktop pony yet.
13nittany check sound?
i cant hear anything
theres no sound
dat blood
Ketchup
:O
The power of catsup/
I shall fill the sound quota with cartoon sound effects
Or not
there we go
w00t!
:O
13sound now?
05wee baldurs gate
this should be good
13let's see that again with sound :3
The chances of me getting anything done this afternoon just went to zero
is this like ff1
11,01Sound.
oh
13when it comes to dnd i usually go rogues that can tank
shit just got real
13so primarily rogue but with plenty of combat
oh yes he can
dat voice acting
13where did he run from X3
05dont like darksiders
i like darksiders
13ded
ow
is this going to be through tutu? Tutu is best mod
05yapyapyap
13yes tutu
05Serenity: its a port
13the end
Someone explain Tutu to me, because back in the day I never messed with mods.
13Baldur's Gate Tutu is a mod that runs BG1 on BG2's engine
Ooooohhhh, me like!
13and adds BG2's magic and mechanics
05skyrim is able to mod away that
13seeing if val is able to multiplayer
I can multiplay!
i shall be out
if only skyrim was multiplayer
bye MASF124
hello there
Skyrim wouldn't work as Multiplayer
13nope
The way the whole came works, it's designed for singleplayer
but i play on ps3
13i'm a little dense though... INT 10
11,01Vein pony?
also you know theres a baldurs gate pony mod right?
"little dense" >.>
:3
WHA
13well the rule of thumb is below 9 you are incapable of whatever that stat controls
05skyrim works jsut fine as multiplayer
05the skyrim online mod pr oves it
well then do we get to loot each other
yes there is a baldurs gate pony mod. let me find it
13so like INT 9 and below means you can't talk right
There's an online mod? :U
05as for TES online
05why would i want anotehr button masher MMO
baldur's gate
http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php
05id rather have a multiplayer TES with coop osomething
Baldur's Gate
oh...
18 int is rare
05becasue skyrim online is a mod
and baldurs gate already has multiplayer. its just not easy to play it online because of ports
no if you die do we get to loot each others if you die
05we dont want another MMO
...
Get a less whiny voice
Yeah, I think GW2, WoW, YTOR, Rift, Aion and some others are enough
I get soooooooo picky with character creation.
13hm
well you can't make the sprites ponies
oh its you
http://saber-scorpion.com/gaming/mods_mlp.php check it out though.
its got the voices, character sets and pictures.
It's the Sword Coast
:O
Hi everypony
because the coastline is apparently dangerous and hard to sail down
yes
13the only problem i have with tutu is it doesn't keep the background music during these bits
11,01Text seems hard to read. Should I go fullscreen?
i havent gone that far
13well imoen is always my sidekick, minsc too
i havent discovered alll of them
Minsc is a requirement
13usually i keep khalid and jaheira for the last two
i finished halfway of the one i discovered
should pick up Viconia because she's best cleric
also Grey Delise
13i've only ever finished once
oh you're both playing together?
Buy NOTHING
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

13hm

Wait, there's actually a reason to keep hold of those?
where do i need to go to download adblock?
13hmm..

13gah
Magika
13oh i see the problem
/me blinks
for that matter these games are tough to play multiplayer
13there we go
because everyone runs off and does there own thing
13i like that the tutorial is split up into all those guys standing around
bad trade off now that I think about it
most were good games
13yeah
13BG2 i stopped at like chapter 4 i think
blasphemy. thats only the underdark
13neat... crashed
I was wondering why my stream froze
great
she's one of the hardest bosses i've ever faced.
irenicus went down easy to me. but then again I knew where all the hidden loot is
bing
wish I had people to multi with.
Nittany_Discord:im using xp i dont get those errors
11,01XP isn't as good for streaming as 7.

11,01It's not. It's a cursed item.
11,01BG has bad items, but you won't know they're bad until you equip them.
*Discord
Well however you wanna put it. Those cats are often vague anyway.
dat line
11,01As far as the r63 belt, you don't know you have it until you equip it.
I prefer the Viconia romance myself. But thats because I fanboy over greydelice
