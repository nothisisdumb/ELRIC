06but it hurts whenever you put pressure on it
12O.O
12owwww ._.
06and then if you try popping it, which I've discovered it wont do, that just hurts even more
Oh, hehe
I was doing math
Sorry to leave you all hanging
/me thinks
I was only alive for 1/723684210 of the existance of the universe
02Have you tried putting heat on it?

12have the doctors told you what's wrong with it?
12(if you have seem them that is)
06LL, I went in for Xrays, they said there's nothing wrong
06I think it healed wrong, though
12O.O
12thats horrible D:
06I sprained it pretty bad, and we wondered if maybe there was a fracture
06considering the fall I took was kinda crazy
/me assumes that if pressure, heat, cold, or popping isn't working then...
10... somehow, I misread "Xrays" as "Xanxus"
10._____.
iirc it's a memory format thing
probably wrong though
12o3o
/me squeaks
12Laa?
02Which can also happen from healing wrong
12oh, hai~ :o

my Lenovo ideaPad S10-3t is cool
I just don't like those tiny keyboards on netbooks, and the fact they have crappy CPUs
why should I want to watch videos on such a thingy, eh?
because?
and by the way: My netbook is around 800 grams in weight....and the battery lasts 10(!) hours :)
with 3G and WLAN enabled
and I got a multitouch-screen
14I might be getting my android phone next week

05Don't you have a sewing machine?
06yeah
02Sewing machine's can't do it all
06but I'm working on a piece that a machine would be difficult for
05Oh. I see/
05**.
02[12:41] 02Sewing machine's can't do it all <--
they're making a remake for OoT
05No they can't do it all, but they're less finger-pricking than a needle and thread!
02OoT?
ya
05Then again they did invent THIMBLES... /winkwinknudgenudge
02OoT?
Ocarina of Time
02I see

06OoT on the 3DS
06I'm sooooooooo ready for it
02Roara's all fired up about it XD

/me is talking about the money thing
06oh
2011, RIGHT?

06Im not even close to excited for it
alot
hopefully capcom put effort into it
06it's gonna fail
hopefully
06okami was a gam you can't really make a sequel from
it says something about a sequel, but then it doesn't
02You could make a prequel though *shot*
06no, it takes place afterwards
when does the 3DS come out? I kind of want to get OoT for he ds now
*the
06dunno
06be
I think I got accepted into my high school I wanted to go to
05Really? That's great May!

well, at least out here in the lausd it is
05There are like twelve high schools in my city.
06and that one is pretty much a dilenquent school
06I drove by it once
02That's how it is here too May
06there's a massive fence around it
14wb Sneas :3
02Lol same with our two schools
12cookies

05We have three "alternative schools" too in my district. But that's 'cause we're inner-city.
tbh I hate both
*for

no county is that centeralized
12Yus, WB :3
12And
in ways of having education planning that is
12I might not be on a whole lot this week

03I seriously want to go into Twilight 3 and start shouting random crap
03and then leave
03XD
06lol
12The wolves were awesome but Edward friggin cullen
04I think Blade should make a guest appearance in the next film to slaughter all the wimpy vamps.
06^
03screw wolves
03there is nothing *good* in that movie
03at all
12Every phrase from his mouth is an emo poem

03o.o
06I don't know if I have any wire around the house
07o3o
07o3o;
06I'll take a look around
with one difference: We had 12 rooms looking like that - well, similar at least
03o.o
03well
03we have 5 buildings
03that's one of them.
03the one I work at
o.o
03each one has their own server room
12hai LLotS~
14:3
inefficient
03tell them that
why not ONE tower rack with ESX machines on them?
03o.o
03that's basically a bunch of quad-core workstations wired together
03to get well over 100 CPUs
/me hides
just 100?
that's half of a rack
03Dunno
03it's kinda cluttered, yeah
03well TimeShift, I didn't count
12must...resist...bad joke...
/me hides
03they *told* me it was over 100 CPUs
03500 is over 100
/me hides
humm
awaiting commands :{P
03is help clean the place up
03so we can put up more racks
03XD
03Yep.
03LOL
ha
035400 and 5500
03there's literally hundreds of those lying around
thought you'd have like blades or something
03blades?
04hellooooo
http://www.linux-magazin.de/var/linux_magazin/storage/images/media/images/ibm_p510/72940-1-ger-DE/ibm_p510.jpg

04Hiya LLOTS
/me hugs
/me also hugs
03yeah TimeShift, we have something like that
03I didn't take a picture of it
we got around 40 of those in one of our datacenters...
03not quite as tall
of which we have FOUR :)
03ours is probably have that size
03...LOL>
03well we only have like 350 employees
/me huggles back
03we don't need over 9000 servers
12hai lol
you're fine with just one
12hmm
12bai drf
/me hides
because those are virtualized systems. One rack can be either one, ten, fifty or one thousand servers - depends on CPU time you need
04lol

0320,000? Woah
03THAT'S OVER 9000
03but really, how does that not kill them?
06LOL
04It might cause him to have a fit - Jack Russells are prone to fits
12LMFAO
12TimeShift said 20.000
12not 20,000
Cya Sneasle
04yeah that's European
03why the .000 then?
04Night
03why not just 20?
12TimeShift was tricking you?
/me hides
03o.o?

03Glacymr, that doesn't work
12lolz
03you can't have two decimals
They say 1,0%? Wth.
03:P
12i know
yep, we do
12it makes the gameshow sound stupid
04I meant 1,2%
04I am bad at maths :P
and it's more natural in fact
12lol RN
04something like that lol
oh gosh
>:
a , splits sentences, right?
/me nods
scribbling grass all over the place hurts the hand
04I'm going to
04bed*
12night RN~
04Night night!
12i find it hard to believe a battery can produce 20,000 volts
If you're using it in that context, then it'd be 1, 2%, not 1,2%.
03you need a transformers
of course
03-s
03I prefer Optimus myself
/me hides
I didn't say anything about the ampere used by the charge
that's why I said you'd need a capacitor
12a capacitor only stores a charge
12it doesn't amplify it
remember the camera flashes?
same function
12o.o
03when I was taking apart a disposable camera
03-r
Were you trying to make a taser?
03No LOL
12nah
03I just took it apart to see how a camera worked
12o.o
12"how to hurt yourself"
03and ZAP
03LOL No
12fine
12typical w/e

/me flees
12nvm
03I didn't WANT to get hurt ><
you'll be hit by around 500,000 volts then
Lol, a 'fancy shock'.
a friend of mine did it once by mistake, trying to fix a computer
Well, I bet they never did it again - lesson learned. XD
03WTF
open and try to fix the PSU = BAD IDEA
03yeah but you said TV
even if not connected to the power, the capacitors can still carry a charge able to stop an average heart
14o.o
well, then it was just my bad. Sorry - had quite a stressful day today
which is...welll....over since around half an hour

02You should see
04Then you get it and go "It's ok but YOU SUCK
02what the school is going to have next term
02Scholaris
04...
04wat
02Basically
04is that
02Teachers etc. can upload assignments onto it
02and parents have their own login

ra
hi
lol hi
planet51 is kinda lame
you also at work?
yep
OF COURSE IT'S LAME
you seen it?
and usually I'm right
:D
:P
it's flawless logic, really
haven't seen an exception except HTTYD
httyd was amazing
rather than going "THIS LOOKS GOOD" and "THAT LOOKS GOOD", I just think it's gonna suk
*suck
like that guardians of w/e movie with the talking owls
WTF is that cra
p
it's gonna suck
:)
have you heard the voices?? LOOOL
yeah, they're stupid
but I know some people on TST are all "The movie woulda been good if not for the vocies"
NO, absolutely not, it's about talking owls, it SUCKS
I'm sorry XD
but seriously
it's animated and it's not by Pixar, it sucks
end of story
:D
its not about talking owls lol
yes it is
riight
all the characters are fricking owls
and they talk
yes it is
/me hides
:P
drf you are utterly stupid
why, just because I don't like stupid animal movies?
no
because you're narrow minded
matrix is about talking people
no, I just expect movies to have something more than just an average plotline
LOL
but seriously
yeh ok but you can't just see a trailer and say oh that's about a cat and nothing else
I didn't say it's about nothing else
I just saw it and was like WTF talking owls
you did
you said its about talking owls
It might not be *about* talking owls
but it still has them
:)
implying thats the plot
lol
yes
no, I'm just saying it HAS talking owls
nvm
you misinterpreted me
or maybe I mis-spoke
w/e
and it looks stupid but the animation is awesome
the animation is good yes but good animation with a crappy story is still crap
I'm just not, it looks like another dumb kids' movie
the fact that they only show the preview before kids movies kinda proves it LOL
?
Like
in America, they show trailers before movies primarily based on ratings
if the movie's rated G, they show you trailers for G and PG movies
if it's R, they show you previews for PG-13 and R
etc
they won't show trailers for PG-13 movies in front of G rated movies
I get it
LOL
I can't wait to see ts3
yeah
it's really good
I'm gonna see it a second time XD
LOL I saw httyd twice
once ib 3d
I saw TS3 in 3D
but I wanna see it in IMAX
imax 3D
?
Yes.
I just saw it in normal 3D LOL
what's normal 3D then?
switch those two sentences around
it'll make more sense lol

12LOL
oh wow.... o.o
I sure hope you had a backup
and the forums?
12Just that it's not connecting to the database
12any idea why?
14<Articuno> It's been down for hours... <--- really?
12@Arti
12ues
12*yes
14I'm connected now
12Ovo
14It works fine O.o
12o.o
12To the site?
14Yeah
12Have you tried F5?>
Why wouldn't it connect to the database?
could it have something to do with the domain host?
12Because there's a problem on the host end
I think I get it
Who's hosting?
12Cyberhostpro
12Lol
hmm
12Not the half I've been on *runs*
In fact, I've spent the whole week with little rest doing just that.

well, that would be just a bit exaggerated. If i'm addicted to anything, it would be TF2

12Hi
12We are now using litespeed technology to make websites allot faster however this has caused a issue with some sites not being able to connect to MySQL, litespeed should of been a none downtime update. We are investigating this and expect to have a fix within a hour.

12Lol
14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uHcEidRRiY&feature=related <--- <3
12Because I have to pay £230 on July 3rd if not
but this one has decent SLAs
03Jeez, my stupid router
!define SLA
-!- service level agreement; stereolithography apparatus; specific leaf area; Sudan Liberation Army, also known as SLM; sealed lead-acid battery; second language acquisition
the first one
12LMAO
12I'd just like a standard host that has decent database connectivity
03http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4184/dsc01580zq.jpg <- my work clothes
03XD
03it's "business casual'
12LOL
12Cool :3
03I think I don't look as overweight with dress clothes
03though they're not that comfortable >_>
12Yeh I hate wearing work clothes, I like how they look on me but they're uncomfortable
12I'm sorry but I've never heard of anyone pay such high prices for standard shared hosting
03what's this about?
12Hosting
03which host
12Mine
03I mean, TimeShift is telling you about another place?
12Thats just it, I want standard shared hosting
12I just need a decent host
03Dreamhost for $8 a year?
/me hides
12You KNOW that sucks
03no it doesn't
03I've never had any problems with it
12....
12OMG
12SERIOUSLY
12HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION DRF???
12YOU'RE JUST SOOOO STUPID D:
12GET OUT OF MY SIGHT XD
03LOL
I'ma go now
Buh bye
03TimeShift, I have oh, a few movie ISOs on mine, probably about 100GB total?
03on my Dreamhost?
03still works fine
12YOU IDIOT
03I don't use *databases* but yeah
12HOW MANY TIMES
12THERE
03Articuno, I SHOWED you a database
12THATS THE PROBLEM
03that was hosted by them
03and you said it worked fine
12Where?
03...
03that blindsniper site, I'd ahve to get the link again
typical american stubbornness...
03but he hosted it on DreamHost VPS and it worked fine
example?
12....
03I use the term 'car"
/me runs
and requires the amount of fuel of an average development country's day-production
12Im sorry but I just don't believe that a server with unlimited EVERYTHING can ever run a database correctly
12For 8.95 a month
03I paid $9 for a full YEAR
/me runs
03but then after that it's like $7 a month
03it was a promo XD
03first year for $9
03they just let me put whatever I want on it
all-american quality products
03what?
03I like my mom's Honda
03which is actually America
03n
03they're made in Alabama
03I don't care where their CEO lives :P
you communist :P
03LOL
03Hondas are made in the USA
...and hamburgers grow on trees...yeah, yeah
03what
of course they are...if that info calms the masses ;)
03Honda has plants in America
03their *headquarters* is in Japan, but that means nothing
I knew it all time long
03because it's cheaper
03I honestly don't care... Hondas are in some ways more American than the American cars
12So where's this site that runs a mysql database on Dreamhost?
03I'm trying to find it in my logs
03I don't have it memorized -_-
12I think I might just leave this till next year considering the host gave me a free 10GB for being a long term customer
0310GB is like, tiny
3Total Free: 4070.50 GB/8333.29 GB
12It is if you pay $8 a month for a crappy host
03LOL
03haven't I suggested OVH already?
12I got 40GB with Powweb..
03I got unlimited with PoWeb...
03*PowWeb
I think it's more like
03stupid 150MB text files
"unlimited!*"
03it's like "We don't keep track but if you start putting 50 gajillion DVDs on there we'll suspend you'
12Havent I told you I wont setup all the server tools and need to have them ready for me to use?
03that's why you have someone do it for you
12Are you offering???
as well as some others which we've just got it working without?
12Wtf
12As in the games like minesweeper etc?
12*Multiplayer minesweeper
03sorry, phone
note the LIVE, it's the XBox LIVE service spread to windoze
03but I mean, the reseller can also do it
03you just have to ask them o.o
03...
03it's called ssh
though WLM -does- use the same account
/me hides
12Um no
12I don't have time or patience for it
12I barely have time for TST
12No it isn't a problem
03oh really now
03PowWeb didn't have cpanel either -__
03*-_-
03it has its own proprietary thing
03you're thinking *web* hosting, not *server* hoisting
03*hosting
12No but Powweb had their own alternative and it was actually GOOD
03you need a server for TST
03not just "Oh, here's my personal website"
03that's why
12I don't want the hassle of controlling a server
12i want it done FOR me
03oh that's great
03they removed the forum
03LOL
03the one on DreamHost
03and you can do whatever you want
12I don't want any of the hassle
03shared hosting is meh, it has more problems since it's *shared*
03um
03I'm quite certain you can install cpanel on a dedi
14Gonna go
12Yeh but I dont want the hassle
03It's a one time setup...
03that's stupid
12It is hassle
12But I NEED that
12I DONT need a dedicated server
03fine, then let TST go down every 2 seconds, I don't care
03I've offered to help plenty of times >_>
03...
12I am managing fine with this one, I dont care that it goes down once every few months but I care that I pay a lot
they need to be patched like any other server
03You can run like, Ubuntu 8.04 and be fine
12DRF TST USED to go down every 2 seconds on Powweb which you seem to think is absolutely great, shows how much you know.
03for that matter I'm still using 9.04
03I never saw it go down at all on PowWeb
03but that one time
12Thats because you never went on the site
03when they accidentally pulled their hosting offline for a day or whatever
03orly
12Yes rly
03I'd go on the forums every once in a while
03just as I do noqw
03*now
12Yeh and back then it used to take over 20 seconds to load
03I just don't go on the *main* site because there's like nothing there
because the services can be exploited easily?
03for you maybe
it happened on TST already
03Linux can be exploited? That's news to me
12Nothing there but all the work I've put in and all the pages I've typed up
12and DRF, it used to be slow for EVERYONE.
we all know you're quite out-of-date
03o.o
03TimeShift, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE UP TO DATE TO BE SAFE FFS
03My workstation at work is a computer from 2003 with XP, works faster than most *new* machines
of course you need
03more than half of software "updates" do absolutely nothing
03are you telling me that I need to update my Wii to menu 4.3?
03all that update did was disable homebrew
12DRF it's not a matter of all or nothing you know
03it does absolutely
03same thing goes with like, iTunes
03and any other multimedia programs
Lol, drama.
03like removing DRM from the files
12TimeShift DRF isn't worth arguing with really, he thinks Powweb is a good host and that there's nothing on TST's main site.
he's a retard
04hellooooo
12Oh come on we all know that already
03>_>
12He argues about things that he doesn't even know about
03orly?
03how do I not know about software updates
12Like a while back he tried to argue that people couldn't understand how an animal is feeling.
04hellooo
03Articuno, w/e, I don't remember that
04Articuno
12Looked at Lunar pages already
04is TST down or something?
03I never said it was a good host for TST
03I said it was a good host for ME
12No it didn't XD
03It did
12See?
03it might have been slow
03but it was acdtually *there*
that's not just dumb, that's insulting
03I'd rather have slow than *NOT THERE*
12No
12You're stupid I'm sorry but you are
04ooooook I think I'll just go
/me poofs
12Since when doesn't it run on my current host? XD
03you're basically saying there's no server in the world that can handle it
03since it GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME?
12I said it runs fine now, I just want to pay less
7LYON
7D:
12and when did it last go down?
04QUAN
/me hugs
7Hey.
03Articuno, this morning>?
12Um yeh? Thats the same issue that we're having NOW
04How are you?
12Thats ONE ISSUE
03I know it is
7Oh, look, Kel-Al Relish Jr. on AQ.
12and that is happening on the whole host, NOT JUST TST
04ohgod
03I remember it's gone down like 4 times in the past year
12See? XD
12OH WOW
12FOUR TIMES
03My server's never gone down
03at all
03neither has bayleef, our OVH host
12with powweb I got the "Unable to connect to database" every single week
7You're gonna need a high-melee defense armor for him.
12More than once a week
03well it went down once when some moron rebooted it LOL
12Fyi the static pages on TST still work
12http://www.lugia.us/chatstats/silverwings.html
03no
12TimeShift yes LOL he doesn't get it
03I'm trying to help, forget I even mentioned PowWeb >_>
03The reseller probably can
04btw Quan
03I linked you to one a while ago
03OVH reseller
7Mmm?
03if not I could probably do it if you gave me the login -_-
12I couldn't find any info in English about their hosting
03installing MySQL is like
04are you just entering the contest with that sprite
03you just download the source, build it, and install it
04?*
03it's not really that hard once you've done it
03I could do it >_>
12Do it then!
12and Cpanel while you're at it
03I'd be willing to...
04well...
12and find me all the specs for the dedicated server on OVH in English
03well I gotta look up cpanel
12and then I'll consider
7If it doesn't qualify, ignore it.
03ovh.co.uk
/me runs
04You're not gonna score well because the contest is mainly judged on accuracy'
7Mmm'kay.
12WTF + Prices
12*@
03yeah nvm that
03http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/
03£15 a month gives you 250GB hard drive
12*advice
03No no
03Kimsufi is an OVH reseller
12Thats more than I pay now and thats WAY too much
12Ok, but still too much
it's NOT about the DISK SIZE!
12LOL
03TimeShift, I never said it was
yes you did
035-6GB is nothing
all the time
03also
12I have 20 at the momen
03<usotsuki> we have mysql on Bayleef <-- that's the OVH server we use
12t
12Oh finally a solid answer DRF
03I TOLD YOU YOU COULD DO IT
03We just INSTALLED It
and how much data traffic and cpu time?
03but
03I'm asking uso if you can temporarily host TST on there and see if it works
12Hmm
03oh
03yeah it runs
03we have a forum
03apparently XD
03I never knew we did
12So.. wtf is Bayleef anyway?
how many MB/s database query, eh?
03http://forum.hoshinet.org/
03there you go
that's the ONLY thing relevant
03we just called it bayleef
03anyway http://forum.hoshinet.org/ <-- that's hosted on OVH
03OVH...
12OVH directly or a reseller?
03directly
12How much?
12Per month
03a ton LOL
12:/
03then again
03that's complete overkill for a fourm XD
03*forum
12I'd rather have TST go down 4 times a year than pay more than £230
03we use it for lots more than that
12o_______O
Murrrnapples :3
12So anyway..
03heck, our drives keep filling up -__
03*-_-
03Articuno, anyway, an OVH reseller would be just as good as the normal
03all they do is just sell you an account XD
12Yeh, but I'd need a good price too
03I swear I found one that was less
03not sure where it was
12Find it again and email me or something with details
03anyway look at that forum I pasted you, that's hosted on there
12I see
12It's fine
03k
12I like the sound of OVH
03OVH is like the biggest provider in Europe
12I just want it somewhat cheaper or maybe the same price as current
03when it comes to dedicated server
03s
03the one I showed you was a "shared dedicated"
03as in they basically just let a bunch of people use one
12Anyway I REALLY need to go now
03OK
12It's 11pm O____o
12I have work and I still have to clean up
03LOL
03cya then
03I'll look around for you

04what exactly happened to TST?
7It borked, in a nutshell.
04oh

HEY
RYFT

NOT MUCH
:P
HOW ABOUT YOU
:o
IT IS TAKING A VERY LONG TIME
DDDD<
an LPAR is not just a logical partition, but even an entire independent, logically separate system on one AIX-machine. And there can be up to 40-50 LPARs on one physical machine
idk like 300 mb it has like 4 albums in it
Only 300MB? :P
waiting for it to download before I go looking for more
depends on how much CPU or memory you need
it's taking a long time is my point dude :P
Biggest download I've seen i 70 GB. XD
is*
I have a 6 gb compilation file waiting on my torrent list
10Meep
it's a compilation of anime opening and closing themes xD

That list came from wikipedia, I think.
no idea, why?
just wondering. They're VERY common all around here
because I don't need one :P
o.o
just get the ipod app
:D

Aurooooooooooooooooooooooooooooora
!espeon
14fff stupid autoconnect
14brb again
xD
i'm sure somewhere in there they celebrate... but not much :P
quite usual, yeah
well, it's made to wake people up in fact
06ours are so....simple
there's an even more evil one - with a high-power light in it to wake you up guaranteed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EYdiB6Dw3Y&feature=fvw
06wow that thing would make me deaf
at least you're awake then
06it speaks lol
it repeats the radio transmission about the emergency call
06and I probably shouldn't have taken it..
06except I need credits
06....oh well WONDERFUL
06the oil well got worse apparently
06the cap was removed
bleh
06it'll be put back on, but fdhuhofdgoidrd
sigh, I failed bigtime
ended up hitting a fence with the SUV and broke the mirri
*mirror
SUV = think slim, drive wide
LOL
well yeah
luckily that's ALL that broke, the thing still drives fine
besides the paint getting a little scratched up, but that's purely cosmetic
06.....LOL
06you hit a fence
yes
swerved into it
06at least it wasn't a Porsche
the official story I'm telling my parents is that I was trying to avoid hitting someone
/me runs
06*like
06and LOL
yeah
that's the thing
06yup
as neither one of our vehicles were damaged
14LOL
06were you making a turn or something?
06I mean...you just swerved?
me? yeah
oh
well
yes, I was turning at liek 40mph
/me runs
06...LOL
yeah
probably shoulda hit the brakes a little more
but I thoguht it would be fun
06LOL
that is, until I hit the fence...
anyway
06at least you didn't flip or something
reminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4QgWRycd7I&feature=related
OVH has normal webhosting (like, cpanel etc) for like 2 pounds a month
I kid you not
breakfaaast
the only thing is there's a bandwidth limit :/, not sure how much traffic TST uses
12Over 30GB a month
2hm
oh that's fine then
2hi Arti
theyg ive you 500GB XD
12Ovo
and for a little more you get 1TB
lemme get the link for you then :)
2TB good
XD
mine has unmetered bandwidth
06TB good unless we're talking disease
/me runs
http://www.ovh.co.uk/shared_hosting/
look at the Personal hosting
though it says "Personal SQL: 1x25MB"
well whatever suits you XD
12I also need the email accoutns you see
how much do you currently pay for yours?
12More than just 10
OK
and 25 megs of database...lol^^
well for 10 pounds a month
you get unlimited everything
:)
basically
12Lame.
06....lol
it's like a shared dedicated server
you get unlimited bandwidth
also 100mbps guaranteed speed
and yes
look at this here: http://www.hetzner.de/en/
wait
you mean on the shared hosting? Maybe
12Yes
12I mean shared
oh
You might be able to, I have no experience with MySQL
12I dunno wtf Personal SQL is meant to be XD
also
lots of their dataservers are in France
12LOL yeh :>
I mean, the one we have is in France
there are a few in English but yeah
oh
you mean plane
06speaking of friends on planes :>
nvm
12LOL
06....LOL
Snakes on a Plane?
/me runs
well, Hetzner has one of the biggest and fastest datacenters here
anyway Arti, http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps_offers.xml <-- that's the other one
even their cheapest one
-S
12lol
/me looks at cheapest one
we could put IRC onto that server then, too
yep
though the one we have for HoSHiNET is like $150 a month LOL
12http://www.ovh.co.uk/products/rps1.xml
like 4 1TB hard drives, etc
12Can't see a problem with that
exactly
that gives you unlimited bandwidth
you can install MySQL on it
if it doesn't already ahve it, I'm not sure
unlimited bandwidth usually means there's another problem with it
TimeShift, no...
Just as I have to go, *pokes Azure* XD
not if it's a dedicated server
the RPS is just a dedicated server that's shared among a few people
honestly, I don't trust those "unlimited" offers for entry-prices by experience anymore
which is why it's cheaper
12XD
12Hai
unlimited *Disk space* is kinda bogus yeah
and THAT's the PROBLEM drf
but unlimited bandwidth really isn't
a problem I had already with TWO other servers
you had a RPS?
yeah
hm
12Yeh but OVH is a good one
well I really don't know, all I know is OVH is one of the best places for that
Hai, I'll be back in around a couple of hours
:<
they've all had like 99.9% uptime
if it ever does go down it comes back about a minute later
our IRC server had an uptime of over a year
before someone at the datacenter accidentally rebooted the machine >_>
12Ok >:
12LOL
some routine maintinence crap
but yeah
it came back a minute or two later
we were just like "Aw, there goes our 1 year uptime"
12Well anyway, I need someone to setup Cpanel for me
OK
I probably could, if I find the installer for it XD
I know it exists
MySQL is easy enough too, we have that set up on our dedicated server
maybe
they waive the setup fee if you pay annually :P
I'd either choose Hetzner or HostEurope
I've never heard of either
well then again I don't know much about database hosting
because you're an american
I just stick to cheap ones and they always work fine for me XD
except Cirtex, that place was retarded
and I would either pich quality
pick
... lolwut?
well
it's like
we'll see ;)
Bose products
they're all fairly expensive
I have no reason not to trust them
o.o
12I'm leaning towards OVH simply because I've seen working MYSQL databases on it
or Bang&Olufsen
In the 1995 WRC, Toyota drivers had been complaining that they found their cars somewhat lacking in the power department. They were disqualified during the 7th event because it was found the team had been using turbochargers.
How does that add up?
or harman/kardon
12ovo
oh, you're talking about speakers
LOL
I never get anything Bose since it's just overpriced
I like Logitech
but that's besides the point
well yeah, but too cheap usually means a lack of performance
Just for fun, I should run speedtest.net on the OVH server
XD
129.99 a month isn't THAT cheap though
12It's reasonable
a GOOD server requires to be properly priced. Those people don't have anything to donate
yeah
LOL, you want expensive TimeShift, you should see the OVH server we use for HoSHiNET
We basiaclly just added everything we possibly could
I believe it costs like 150 Euros a month
or something crazy
it's a server...
12Thats less than I pay now LOL!
well, suits you
12No wait
12Sorry
I said a month
not a year
XD
12I thought you said a year then XD
12LOOOOL
TV shows
etc
and store them on there
availability guaranteed 99%
25€/month
then again don't believe everything that you read :P
I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong here
Do you just like disagreeing with me or something? >_>
anyway brb
06the village idiot
back
and that's just great
and he took his laptop with him
>_>
hm
I'm gonna attempt to do something crazy
12What?
12Hai
06.....lol
using VNC over a remote access
/me runs
12LMAO
since I have no VNC client here
and I wanna speedtest bayleef
just for fun
XD
EW IPHONES
/me hides
06so my mysterygift arrives tomorrow
06....kyu wtf
12phone
TimeShift, we *have* one
because as I said before: All that counts is database throughput
connecting flight
http://forum.hoshinet.org/
06lol
how many tables, how many mb of DATABASE size?
06so, is it hot over there? :>
I have no idea...
Total posts 209 • Total topics 133 • Total members 198
06...lol
06so you literally just landed then
Floof has arrived!
there's not an app for that?
honestly drf? My PHONE could handle a database THAT TINY
/me hides
eh
I still don't see why you're trying to prove me wrong
06Kyu, 97 degrees
06....
14lol
14XD
<MajinMew> 18 f us
06WELL FINE
15 f us
XD
<Omegle> >> Disconnected.
>.>
/me runs
</random>
06lolwut
nothing
TST has around...well....7k users, 40k postings in around 2k topics?
06xD
just waitng for soemthing
*something
plus additional databases for THREE galleries, the news, the oekakis, the cms and more?
as I still don't see why that's a problem
YOU may have around 12 tables with alltogether 2MB of payload - WE have around 400 tables with OVER 300MB of payload in the database
and everytime the size is doubled, the CPU time you need increases by the factor of 4
sigh
I really don't feel like arguing this with you
especially with MySQL, which is terribly imperformant with huge databases
like, it's only because I mentioned it that you're fighting
same - I don't like to fight an intellectual battle with unarmed people
I think you just like arguing with me about anything >_>
honestly?
06....ok now we're getting a little harsh, guys
and you're not doing that how?
no matter if those people are experienced with it
You're trying to insist that the one YOU found is the one and only right thing and that the one I found isn't
12heh
a little difference between us two drf: I have STUDIED the entire thing and AM WORKING in this metier since more than TEN YEARS
this gives me EXPERIENCE and throughsight - something you lack
having experience with databases is different than picking webhosts out of a hat
FLAMEWARZbant
third: I don't want to pick something just "cheap" or "expensive", I want to pick something the right performance for TST because I think the page DESERVES sufficient reserves for the future. It needs a good reliablility, speed and should be able to grow
right, and again, you're just naming random hosts... how is that any different than me recommending OVH?
may I give you an example? I ask for database performance, and YOU come and tell me about harddrives and sizes of them
06holy crap, seriously....this is ridiculous guys
06yeah apparently
06but still
12i know TimeShift and drf way too well
10yeh well, Aurora's stupid enough to tell them to stop
06yeah but sitting around watching these two go at it is really sad >_>
that was like one thing
I also pointed out that the RPS has unmetered bandwitdh (which is a good thing)
...
topic missed, F, sit down!
/me 7blinks at this discussion.
04heh
thank you
I don't start arguements, really, I'll just defend myself if people start making accusations
Uh
Then again in TimeShift's defense DRF can be rather dense about silly arguments
... that's ALL he does
04and when he doesn't get his way
04he takes a long vacation from TST
06TimeShift basically said his cat is smarter than drf >_>
XD
10^
2(Aurora2): Even an ordinary carpet would be smarter in this place
06while I fully support arguments, I support fair arguments
06...
on a random note

or. rather. she needs to rework her system.
That is probably the biggest waste of resources ever but it works :P)
*:)
with more OPs, and lots more halfops
12Aurora
12there is no such thing as a fair argument
TimeShift has some qualities TST needs
06which I don't doubt
*:P
06drf was pointing out his findings
06yes I have
10true
because you STILL didn't get the point
It's similar really
lol
I dont know why we're heckling on EITHER because of ... argh XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z4m4lnjxkY&feature=related
..and then ops <censored> to me that I'm not allowed to tell people they aren't allowed to do something
06I do't know why you're trying to let them go on like this...the arguing is over some of the stupidest things
06exactly
you mean like all of them?
10most
also Insults doesn't belong in any arguement...
and I tell you out of experience: low prices and unlimited traffic have a catch
http://www.speedtest.net/result/857146001.png <-- Speedtest results from OVH :D
Just AS silly
...
Just AS resource wasting
but it's common as well
TimeShift, just drop it
DRF is just like that
/me 7sits across IRCs while waiting for these situations to simmer down.
06TimeShift is just like that too, Lyalia
I would, but as I'm in germany not a single court would accept such a sue here
eh. I thought she was ok
I'm not in america you know
LOL
would be NO PROBLEM there
10she was, until she was modded
06and now we get into who's been here longer...?
No o.O
06that's stupider than the argument LOL
It was a comment XD
IJSDFHjdfsdsf
YOU'RE SUCH A FLOOFHEAD.
which adds to the 'nobody's there when you need them' thing
LOL
06that doesn't change the fact that this is out of hand
where does America/Germany get into this? Where does insults get into this?
all the mods are like that though
Really, it's silly
O___o
Espeon is right, I'm rather amused actually
10Glacymr and LLOTS aren't
10Kyu not really either
keep in mind I haven't seen their modlist in like. ages
or it seems that way, at least <.< >.>
others I mind though
Espeon: It turns into a liquidy thing of floof
in a weird way I guess
06I just think that bringing in insults to an argument that really shouldn't have existed is stupid
timeshift pissed me off from the moment I saw him.
DRF has been known to say odd things, as has TimeShift
lol
somehow I think I knew already
06I haven't seen anything drf has said as wrong (in this particular argument)
its BECAUSE he pops up
06I know he says stupid things, but still
sarcasm, he says that all the time
TimeShift as well
Apart from the insults I can't see any of them saying anything wrong
o.o
Hm
oh
4+=1414.11.034=+ <TimeShift> I would, but as I'm in germany not a single court would accept such a sue here
WELL MY POINT IS that I don't have a point
06that's the thing though, the insults have been somewhat one sided this time around
lawln00b
seriously, all I've done this whole time is defend myself -_-
06TimeShift, amazingly, MOST of us actually care for this community
I should also leave and go get back to work XD
because I care
10[14:15] <%Aurora> TimeShift, amazingly, MOST of us actually care for this community
10haha, lies
DRF bugger off to work XD It'll all be good in the end~
06again, others DO care
I don't want to see TST run into such a trap like other pages did
yeah, there isn't a community!
I mean
10they're never around when we need them
I do, but at the "my friends are there and I doubt I can get them to go elsewhere" level
Heh
lol
10yeh
TimeShift wasnt saying we should select expensive solutions
I'm really there because I see no reason not to... yet
He mentioned IF we have to
He wasn't saying we ARE
mostly its just all noobs now. is kinda why I left to begin with
12he did state though that cheap hosts have catches
06no, but he sure attacked DRF for apparently forcing Arti into his suggestion
no but he seems to be implying that the one I found is "bad"
which is dumb, you can get expensive OVH servers that cost a TON if you want
@ attacking DRF - not acceptable, but I was remarking on the actual thing
10I don't really understand why I stay around either
06what actual thing lol
06I understand both had their ideas
06but there are ways of going about how to say that
the thing which wasn't the attacking of DRF ;p
that or they stopped showing up, etc
04keeping peace in that place
04is a hard job
06once you start getting aggressive like that, blah
more like impossible
set mode +b *!*@*, that should quiet things down
sigh
I really don't need this right now
/mode #SilverWings +b @
I have work to do LOL
bbl
8D
XD
lol
04i can't +b other mods Quilava
you need the *'s
04well sure i can but they'll just turn them off themselves lol
sure you can. it just won't do anything till they leave the chan
Quilava: automatically becomes *!*@*
06lol
/j #lolz
that one is always interesting
/mode #lolz +b @
no offense, but if he didn't know Arti as well I bet he would be banned for some sort of offense.
:/
10?
04XD
psh, it doesn't matter. say you were joking or something
and him joking? hah
04TS has no sense of humor :P
TS that is
06I don't mind arguments, but I prefer not to let them continue if it's going to end up like that
04Skylands
04i do all that i can
04therefore i have no shame
that'd piss him off more
Arguements doesn't have insults. At least then all respect for the arguement should vanish magically.
inorite
06^
LOL
huge difference
04i try to be understanding
to him, at least
Agreed @ Espeon
4 px is a huge difference?
04i try to sit in the other person's shoes and understand their logic and standing on things
i think you're all stupid
06lol
teehee
whiiiich is annoying
How nice
04however
04i've been accused many times
06not in my nature
04for arguing just for the sake of disagreeing lol
Wasn't saying that o.O
Was just saying it could be sort of tricky to go it
*go about with it
*everyone
oh yes
everyone
lopl
04but he keeps on accusing me of that on a weekly basis
[20:21:03] <Bloatedfish> i think you're all stupid <- right back at you LOL
06now, if this was an actual debate channel, then I'd for sure either get into it (like I did) or sit around
04like i said
04and permanently stop this
06insults have no place in it
04and leave TST for another 2 months
... dude. then get him pissed off
If one topic becomes too dominant in here (bar insults) there is usually attempts to break it up.
him gone = good

04i still remember the first time he left
noes
THAT REMINDS ME
06no, I have it saved
Still <censored> drama to me. :3
06I don't feel like memorizing it
wait, YOU PEOPLE CAN REMEMBER? D:
06espeon, not anymore
oh

hax0rz
04where people were supposed to search the forums for how TS's character looked

you don't complain about something you get for free
honestly though, I have a bit of a problem getting over how much my significant other sometimes dislikes the community. He wants to fit in, but feels such an amount of ... exclusion
12o.o
and lol
04then TS left TST for like 5 months lol
ever since two years ago
is this a flashback sequence?
AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING
No.

04honestly
that is actually hilarious. But I would mentally high-five if TS just stepped in and banned everyone for an hour or something
6How are ya?
04what's the point of spamming
that would be epic
04it doesn't do anything
I dunno, appearently people find it "fun"
04it doesn't make any social progress XD
it makes a wall of text
I mean spamming like scripts and such can be "fun" but just goingashduahdoiusajdoisajd

04i'm starting to like the wii and the ps3 a lot more
stupid MS Outlook :@
/me stabs it for freezing all the time
04nah
and an upgraded PS3 is somewhat meh, due to the fact that it can no longer play PS2 games
6XD
04i never got a RROD
I know, for I have one XD
04but it's just not the system for me
doesn't the wii have like, no good games?
7oh be ashamed. BE ASHAMED.
I like all the consoles really o.o
Prefer PS3 though
04i'm someone
04who likes online gaming
7I still play it on my bro's old GBC
6Randomness?
but, oh the irony, I like my vista more
04a month of membership
I'm guessing not
Only because of mods
No, I'm 11 right now.
06you tend to stab everything lol
04that's not good use of money
12Ew Outlook
well not 'everything' :p
exaactly >_>
but my company uses it
12Same here
7is epic win
I'm 15 now don't mean I'm any les creepy.

LOL
06oh look arti is back
06anyways
XD
04funny enough even though the wii has the least good games
04i think i like the wii more
06I've gotten like....a quarter of my work for this week done
06and I've been at it for 3 hours
the wii has some good games
but I shall try anyway
and some games that arent needed
06not to mention something I missed last week ._.
XD
06and what's horribly sad
04like the fact i broke 2 PS2s
04by doing nothing
Most people have a wii, if they have any modern console, but people never seem to use them.
I still have my PS2, and it still works. :)
???
LOL
04lol Okami
04is a very good reason to have a Wii
06and yet I STILL have to suffer through this
"But I already DO stay away from Wndows!"
*Windows
06....LOL
/me pokes Quilava

this is a company, we don't use bootlegs LOL
*official* XP CDs, otoh
12Oh yeh
I'd totally use DBAN if I could
just no way to burn it >_>

06my birthday i guess
?
06yeah
OK
sell the macbook
06lol
seriously, those things cost like $1500
You could get a beastly laptop that'll pwn most desktops for that
06it shipped from china to alaska, and it apparently on route to my stepmom's work now
o.o
06at this point, after working weeks with macs
you can't just go to an Apple store and ask for a refun?
*d
06my problems were the mouse, the keyboard, and the fact my programs would be limited
06I don't want to do that, in a way I still want it lol
why?
06explaining it to you? difficult LOL
12BACK LOL
06and I'm not entirely sure
no but why would you possibly want a Mac?
wb
06the BEST way to say it is that my parents just bought me a laptop without me even hinting I wanted it
06I'm not about to turn around and say no
06I'm going to take it and use it
2bah
12DRF
12Sentimental value
XD
well
12Like
12We sold our Wii, but I didn't sell SSBB because it was a gift from Nick XD
12I can't play it XD it just sits there
12XD
and I'll be liket his and this
06parents always say that, drf
they don't mind XD
and I take them up on the offer
well make this that 1% :O
06not really
unless you like being a mac using n00b
06hey
06I'm not you ok
12No some people just don't like returning gifts
06I don't care about apple that much
/me runs
06but I'm not purely 100% anti-apple
um
12DRF
06it's not even that horrible
12My mum bought me the most horrible dress once XD I would never in a million years wear it but I dont want to give it up
06to me, at least
not to mention the most important thing: a working mouse
where you can right click
LOL
well I can
06I have my tablet for that
/me runs
12Some people are different
06yes
12LMAO
06it does actually
XD
well
if you're gonna keep it -_-
06which I'll have to do
06Paint Sai wont work otherwise
but I mean
XD
well
just going "I don't want it" is one thing
isn't that bad IMO
12I'd feel horrible and my parents would too
12:>
06lol if you knew me, that's the HARDEST thing for me to ay
06say
06becaus ei know how my parents would feel, yeh
06they were actually REALLY excited about this
/me runs
06excet the apple
06which is very noticable
yeah
06if my computer suddenly lacks an apple
not if you're not looking for it though
XD
well
get one of those little skins for it
that covers the log
o
/me hides
12DRF come on
12She wants to keep it :>
12Let her
06hey, let him argue about it lol
06not going to change my decision
06:P
12XD
fine, I'll let you suffer with it, whatever
12¬¬
06I mainly hated those stupid mouses, and the stupid keyboard
06both of which I wont be dealing with
/me runs
I've always wanted to try that XD
12LOL
except for the lack of a numpad
bah
which is like the single most useful thing on a keyboard
besides the letters o.o
but ew top row numbers
LOL fail
06never used it
you must not type numbers a lot then o.o
12It's like.. why not just get an XP laptop? LOL
06then again, I've been living with a laptop that lacks the right-hand numbers
because Apple is that stupid?
12Yeh
06I ONLY use the top numbers
LOL
well
06that's all it has
my friends have laptops with no numpads
and it drives me crazy
06which sucks for alt-number commands
I'm like GAAAAAH WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS
exactly
06well
12I have one of those, it annoys me too
06I'm not you
that too :P
I have a laptop with no numpad either, I hate it
06you're not me
/me runs
LOL
where most similarly sized laptops don't
12Then I realised that I NEEDED the numpad for work
XD
I've used the numpad as long as I could remember
/me runs
12LOL
nah, I have no problem with XP, but I'd prefer 7 XD
I'm using Xp right now, since this computer is from 2003
06I'm on XP, no problems
but like
this thing sucks
the DVD burner
burns at 1x speed
it's gonna take me like an hour and a half
12HAHA
to burn one DVD
>_>
it's not my computer, it's my work's
they just let me use this XD
12At least you'll get a longer lasting DVD with it
/me explodes!
14^v^
Germany won!
burning at 4 or 8x makes it last just as long
12Nah
not to mention the stupid disc has scratches all over it
12Well
I found it on a shelf LOL
only disc I could find
They did? :D
EW SOCCER
yeah
1:0
06football yes!
EW BOTH KINDS OF FOOTBALL
06ok, pigskinball is only fun during the superbowl
Ghana
OH THAT'S JUST GREAT
06and football....I like playing it, and it can be fun to watch
"DVD media error"
12LOL Ghana
and it stopped burning
DL:
*D:
see, you just can't burn at 0.7x and expect it to work
12LOL
03D:
using a good burner XD
I must say, though
06wow...
that's actually really good
for a second I read that as stupid laptop
/me runs
06tbh, that's a good deal
06both OSs on it
/me hides
06or if you're talking about my current one, 1) my laptop is old as heck, 2) my other computer is old as well, and supports files for 6 people, and 3) I'm not as competent as you in computer knowledge
12Not very good ones to be fair
12Infact Mac only do graphic editing programs good
and by good she means average at best
/me runs
and layouting
seriously, there's really nothing you can do on OSX that you can't do in Windwos -_-
*Windows
and yes, *crap*
06Again
12No, most professional graphic editing businesses use macs
it's bloated as frick on any OS
06I've been offerend a mac
Like
06so
06why not
No, they're just stupid and don't know how to use a proper computer
14o.o
no, all I'm saying is
why run OSX
06but again
06I don't care
and only use that
:P
06what's happened has happened
06I'm not going to whine, complain, and go around my parents' gift just because someone else thinks it's stupid
06and I personally don't have any oposing thought
I'm just saying, don't bother with OSX
o.o
04lol

http://www.spyroforum.com/post-326797.html#326797
lol
and Neotyguy continues to say "he"
Seriously?
XD
yep
fail
I even told him on SC that I was a girl
yeah even though we corrected him ourselves
yeah
Because it doesn't matter...
Have a splendid day, and next time try not to insult others out in the open.
XD
Lol fail
hahaha, yeah
look at sr's post
Proof that anarchy wouldn't work
hi, thanks
np
No
Or at least, I'm not
me neither
oh wait
for a second I didn't read the "if"
I'd just sit back and lol as all the members leave
Missionaries are Christians, but not all Christians are missionaries
I know
I was agreeing
Yeah
I can totally see it right now
And he'd edit everyone's posts and fix the chatspeak and typos
XD
Because he has OCD!!!!
yeah remember when he said that he would if he was a mod??
uggggh
http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/drfsupercenterBanner.jpg

03except I want that centered
03and no slash
03and png
/me hides
Ok.
pretty much
Haha
:D
I read it like there's a random break in the middle of his sentences
or like he's trying to write poetry with his posts
*rawr*
I'm in Calculus again
Did you see that some member left because they're sick of religion and dragons being brought up everywhere?
it just screams GAAAAAY to me
yeah I did
It was Starscream or something
I don't blame them
they were mad because the topic would go from dragons /to/ religion
o.o
Nala!!!!!!!!!!! :D
Oh yeah, maybe
One moment, gotta do a quiz
=]
I didn't read it very carefully
zI honestly didn't mind all the religious discussions as long as they didn't go crazy about it
I don't either
And then Neotyguy got all [censored]y in the about you thread because we were all saying our religions
people just need to be open to the fact that their beliefs aren't the only ones
that annoyed me\
It doesn't even annoy me that much when they bring it into everything
Exactly
my beliefs change every day
same here
Yeah, it's stupid
I just look at atheism as another religion really
04Brother: Yes, I only have Morrowind
exactly
Getting upset about things like that tells me you're insecure
Might not be the case, but that's how I tend to interpret it
http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/drfsupercenterBanner-1.png
And on the other side, Raidon Makoto and Fletch_Talon
And Apoc
yeah
he's a bit over obsessed with his atheism
apoc is just rude about it all
it irritates me
yeah he is
Good?
I think it's because they feel more comfortable being like that onlinen
I mean really there's no reason to insult people in that way about it
03hm
03looks alright, but for some reason the letters look weird
and then they go online and they're a bunch of over obsessed reliious folk
this kind of reminds me of a thread on another forum
Basically this person is getting angry because no one accepts her Buddhism
TS?
Yet she doesn't even want to read about other religions when it's assigned in school
No, GTS+
heh
I've been hanging around there lately
I don't get that
it's like, you don't have to be that religion to learn about other religions
"YOU'RE FIRED, GET OUT OF MY DAMN OFFICE!"

Ok.
one of my favorute cl[censored] last year was the one where I learned about how Jews and Muslims interpret things differently than Christians

There's an iFail?
6I accidently refreshed the page..-.-
7C7: uDo
raaaaaaaaaar
Complain.
7mess with bots before SR bans them
Nala: How's you?
6That came 1,5 years ago
it already came out
7it's funner. more fantasmical
04sigh
i probably shouldve made a name up instead of using my real one
exactly but ive nevr playd anyothers ecept eternal night
/me sits next to Nala
6I think Eternal Night was the best of the TLoS..
7I hate TEN
We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets /heads/ are fallin' off!!!!
.-.
woot
then don't play?
13!Espeon
/me now belongs to PokemonStar for 4 minutes
04there is nothing else for me to play
whos TEN?
The eternal night
04i just wish for once
play 1D tetris
oh. it easnt that much fun evn though i havent finshed it
its really REALLY hard to be bad at
04trust me i'll find a way
probably the negative reinforcement
04negative reinforcement?
I havent gotten around to trying DotD
04i guess you can say that, it's called karma
you saying that you suck
04by doing good things?
04that's not in my nature 8D
whats dotd
no... by practicing - learning of mistakes and ask for advice rather then constant whinig about bad luck :P
04bad luck is the only plausable explanation
04what proof?
metronom battle...
04it was very close to 50/50 though
thats called "statistic" not bad luck :P
04statistics is luck
04or rather statistics is how luck is measured
12Back for now
7they don't die
04wb
12Ty
04i swear that shaco was a hacker
04he had a godlike by like level 8
7have you seen the epilogue cutscene?
7always watch the credits
04maybe earlier
epilogue? thers a show after the credits in dotd
04and of course i had to argue with my team-mates again that it was a lost match within the first 5 minutes of the match after shaco was decently fed
12blarg
7though how they survived defies all logic
04by the time i could even call out a surrender, they were already beating at the nexus
6Lol.
hi
wb
hey
hat did he do in dotd to put the world back together he rose and turned purple light

night night all
02Hey
/me goes back to playing Raze
02mmk
13Shiny~
02Pokestar~
13._.
02I know, but you usually are off by 10 or 11
/me sits on Pokemonstar
04Hiya
02Hurray~
/me is pushed off
/me crawls under Pokestar
02:3
13Somewhat
13I'll have to yard work tommorrow, then pack, then I leave for Wyoming.
02D:
02You should come to the other state with W
02No, but a couple years ago my grandparents were .-.
13Heh, timing
02Besides, there's no stopping from coming out here for vacation or anything
02Hmm
02Not very good
02Depending where you guys go
02I mean...I'm guessing the first thing that pops into people's heads when someone says going to Wisconsin for vacation would be "Why would anyone want to go there?" XD
13:/
02Not the point
02Heck, I LIVE in Wisconsin, the first reason I think of when I say vacation here is cows
02Next would be the Wisconsin Dells
13Wisconsin Dells?
02Again
02That's probably why people would say "Why would we ever want to go there?"
02Ah speaking of Wisconsin Dells...
13Hmm?
02We'll be going there in a few weeks
02Coz my other cousin from...another state...is coming to visit
13Heh, all my cousins are in Wyoming or Colorado
13http://i45.tinypic.com/sw8zki.jpg
13xD
13Would that be Time of Running Prey or Time of no Sun?
02Running Prey
13K
02Time of No Sun
02Because winter there is hardly any sun
13So there's only two seasons?
02For ArcticSun yes
02And I feel like drawing them
13What about Fall? Would that fall into Running Prey (even though its cold) or No Sun (but there is Sun)?
13Yeah...
02...
/me yawns
04meh
04finished playing Raze
13This would be like Mid August- November
13Cool

02Well...

04that'll appear in the second sequel to DoI (if I finish the first one)

that's just a bunch of comic characters
*:P
TimeShift › http://gallery.gajus-tempus.de/data/media/6/Worlds_Biggest_Trademark_Violation.jpg <- I don't even know where to begin
That's like if I mention McDonald's I can get sued

"Click to install updaets" *click* "Updates were not installed"
OK WTF is wrong
did you know other studios got sued whenever they mentioned "Harry Potter" or such in a movie?

how did they get it?
lawl at the trailer
therefore they COULD sue the other
yeah but saying Monsters Inc in a trailer for Monsters Inc...

I have no sound here

ever heard of WSUS?^^

no
http://friendsofirony.com/2010/06/09/ironic-photos-so-its-our-fault-now/
it just sits there saying "installing" for 20 minutes
!define wsus
those take about half an hour *each*
for all 50 of them
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_Update_Services
server?
suppose you have at least one server on the network?
we do
hm
I don't think we have that set up
though we do have like, bootleg versions of software
/me hides
I was looking on the Software folder in the network drive
spotted a couple keygens
even got flagged as viruses >_>

most antivirus is retarded
it flags pirated material as viruses for legal reasons

whatever the case is, I'm just doing it manually
http://friendsofirony.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/129056569656350354.jpg
well the thing is all our computers have different OSes
and?
I don't see the problem
XP has different updates from 7
still don't see the problem
as do the x86 and x64 versions
o.o
whatever
this computer isn't even on the domain yet
oh
but yes, Win7 is also supported by the Service
o.o they announced a 7 SP1?
for developers?
o.o
this is why you shouldn't install like 200 updates in one day LOL
and that's why you should use WSUS instead. If a computer's registered in the domain, you can monitor and administrate it through the console, knowing exactly which computer has which patch and is allowed which patch
http://friendsofirony.com/2010/05/08/ironic-photos-would-have-thought-prepared/

still, it's just taking ages to download the updates

I didn't ASK for it
my parents just up and bought me one
and i'm sorry for being the one who's too nice to say no
take it and swap it for a real computer then^^
...
>_>
I CAN'T swap it, it would hurt their feelings
I'm not going to put it in a corner
and it needs to be completely erased
but I still want my old program...
not even on a virtual machine
Hey
it runs, but wont combine the tablet with the program
that's why there's a Wintel-Universe and a Mac-Universe
again, yes I know
still, if you have any problems, I'll do my best and help you
Paint Sai IS installed
but wont recognize my tablet
-_-;
Also hey to Lyalia
....k, did you take a look at the Apple support forums then? Maybe those guys know a solution
maybe you just need to install specific drivers?
did you go to the tablet's manufacturer website and look for Mac drivers there?
it works just fine on a mac
but combining the two doesnt seem possible
which drivers?
maaaaaaan this is frustrating
for the tablet?
I just need this all to be transferred and settles
settled
and I'll be fine
it's just getting there that's the problem
whilst the first step is the hardest and the last step reaches the target, the steps in between those two are the best of all
well that didn't work
lets see....
oh
I also need drf's portable irc
I forgot this one is unregistered
I saw it by the font colour :P
yeh
welll.......
even GIMP doesn't recognize the tablet...
very interesting
may I ask for the model name?
I'll try and help you searching then :)
6lets see
6CTE-450 bamboo fun
6unless it takes issue with macs too
6but even then I don't understand, because it worked fine on the macs at school
you downloaded and installed it already?
6yes
6I installed the tablet last night
with the current drivers from the website?
tried these her? http://www.wacom.com/downloads/driver-detail.php?id=202
6yeh I tried the them
after you've installed the drivers, try plugging the tablet out and back in
6did that too
6yup
as far as I read, Photoshop seems to also have that kind of problems
6yes but it worked at school
6so if it works here, then it's not the tablet
...
and again my cat's sitting on my lap
6yay pantry raids
6<3

@drf: Know what's a good thing about the host I looked for?
these two points:
99.99% uptime guarantee
FREE comprehensive 24/7 support
12Yw :p
12*:P
until it goes down and they say "whoops"
04*spam
and they all have support too, LOL
there's a difference between 99%, 99.9% and 99.99%
still
guaranteed really means nothing
call it wishfull thinking
99.9% means 8 hours and 45 minutes of downtime per year
yes, but guarantees are pointless when *their servers go down*
it's all just statistics IMO
You missed an orgy the size of Mexico City
or well not really
those are SLAs
04hi Quilava
04how goes
okay
SLA?

See, Cyber Host Pro says its uptime is 99.98%

and I say that's complete BS
:P
lol WUT
Espeon
but they don't have 24/7 service :)
:O
http://www.webhostingstuff.com/company/CyberHostPro.html
that's not my point
and they're not in business since more than ten years
my point is any place can say they have whatever percent uptime
but that doesn't eman they DO
*mean
03Damn. That's pretty huge. o.o
/me hides :3
They can say they have 99.9999999999% uptime because they've lucked out and their connection hasn't gone down
Until that one time it does and they compeltely screw everybody over...

in addition to another computer
basically because i don't need two laptops
that are the exact same
Hey Proto!
because it was made 5 years ago? :P
lol
and it's probably 3x as good as a current macbook?
me runs
*/me
XD
i'm getting a normal laptop anyway, i'm just getting this because that $1200 cannot be used on anything else
12lol
it can only be spent on a laptop
insuranc
-x
maybe a Blu-Ray drive
i am
[3:36:02 pm] in addition to another computer
yeah but why waste money at all?
just keep it for something else
i cant... lol
otherwise i would, but i don't really have an option
read lo
[3:38:06 pm] insurance
insurance is paying for two computers?
yes I heard
one is gone, the other is not working properly
yes basically
we *have* to buy laptops with the money, which is kinda silly but eh
I got an idea then
buy a Macbook, then sell it and buy a really good desktop
/me runs
LOL
you actually have a point xD
http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/funny-graphs-stepping-banana.jpg
lol
04lol
04best i've done was 15/3/15
but no deaths is always good
04i'm trying to get used to TF
04but playing him gives me a massive headache
why?
04well TF is about being hard hitting
yes
04well yeah
its how I tend to get my early kills
04it's supposed to be how you get first blood
04if they run
04f
I use ignite/teleport
04or escape if things didn't quite go as planned
04anyway i'm trying to learn TF
WELL HE SHOULD HAVE IT D:<
I usually would use yellow cards instead
04yellow is great for ganks
04red is great for farming and damage
14I misread ganks
/me shot
lol
04Altair
04literally XD
:D
03ur
04actually Quilava i played against him yesterday
04that ability is no fair
04the body actually runs around and chases you
*champion
04after he dies
yeah that's not really fair
04the body just sort of squirms over to you FAST as heck
04not to mention it does a decent amount of damage as well
actually Anivia's passive is pretty good as well
04the egg thing?
04yeah
yeah. its like that armor thing
revives every now and then
04because that egg is hard to kill
04well yeah

03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129151728717434904.png

but then thats the "news"
/me 6hisses
03thought you'd like laughing at that though :P
Didnt he hit puberty or is he somehow still evading it?
03Hi :3
6my friend (who loves his music) and I went shopping yesterday
6and we had to listen to it on the way up
6and then we went into a store...where they had it playing
6I was like "ffs REALLY?"
10Hey Sneas :3
6hard choice though
6Justin Beiber
J: that reminds me of "MIM" talk XD
6I remember making a joke about the same thing
6...
that's insulting to all Bibarel! D<
/me 6never noted Ke$ha compared to bieber
/me 6now notes the similarities
04omg Quilava
04that boils me with rage
hm?
04before you can even call a surrender
wow.
6hmm...
were you doing the whole sit in the corner thing?
04no
04but 3 of the players in our team were
03nubbds?
03-d
041 from the very start
hey carie!
well there's nothing you can do about that
6the tip of a tablet pen
03go buy a stylus LOL
04i don't give enemies the honor of destroying the nexus
04that's my motto
6meh
lol
6are they expensive?
6pens are WAY expensive
04but of course if you cant call surrender before that happens
6like...over half the tablet cost
03styluses are 3 for $5
03:P
03like, the DS ones
6...
6um
04screw this
03you can even get like, Pokémon tipped ones
03for $10
04i need to find a tank character i can actually play good
6tablet pens are way different than styluses
03orly?
is spyro rocks on?
6this isn't a touch tablet lol
03it's just plastic at the end, right?
03....
03wtf kind of a tablet do you have
03in the one I used it was just touch sensitive
03and it was literally a stylus LOL
6tbh, I've never heard of a touch tablet
04who is a good tank
6but it makes sense I guess
03the ones we had at camp were
03Wacom tablets
03this pisses me off
nice first episode here
6^
03there was even a mouse you could put on it LOL
6wacom bamboo fun
03erm
6that's the kind I have
03that was just a normal stylus o.o
6...
03and it would move
try dr mundo?
6oh well
03try it LOL
6this one isn't touch
03on the ...wtf?
6just did
6the pen itself has sensors
03you got ripped off then LOL
04i don't own dr mundo lol
6which is why they're like 60 bucks
6not really
03I hate stupid overpriced crap like that
oh
04i've thought about trying to be good at Rummus but meh
6it's really nice...I'd kill my fingers using a stylus tablet
6unless they're like....super touche sensitive
6...
6*touch
lol last hits.
04what do you mean?
carrington!!
6oh
6whatever
syphoning strike?
04i just want a tank i can play good
ohwait
03it was such an annoyance, I was like "Who the frick actually LIKES these"
04because a team of 5 squishies
6except when I messed up the drivers once
hey
04does not make a good team
6that's why i don't use the mouse
heyyy
04yeah
04the armadillo
6it responds just like the pen
04yes
i want u to create a spyro forum member account
04[16:59:28] <Quilava> syphoning strike?
04you are thinking of lucario
04XD
10404 Not Found page shows up when I try to get on TST, anyone else having this problem?
6duh
04Nasus
6oh
help me like u did on spyrochat
6dunno
6i haven't bothered with the forums since they went down LOL
03http://www.drfsupercenter.info/cgiproxy/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http/www.lugia.us/forum/
03that works for me
a shame Pride only comes untill much later
03only the forum though
04i thought about playing him as well
04Cute_Riolu opinion please?
ok ill be back in a sec
10Hm
like...32 wise we see him and maybe 38 wise we see his powers
10Not working, drf
10:/
6skylands
6it's working for me
03o.o
04who do you think is more annoying or higher tier
03it gives you a 404?
10Yeah
helo?
*Hello?
10Want me to screenshot it?
03weird
03nah
oh Kimbly is in the first episode..who knew
6read that as Kirby, and I was like wtf
6well, we all know he has secrets >_>
though it would be scary is Kimbly=Kirby o.o
*puff
6dfjghdhfggor
6headache
6throbbing pain in my temple ._.
6that was random
nassus is actually pretty easy to kill
04yeah i've played him a couple times
04Rummus seems to be hard to get kills with as well though
6ugh
04or rather he's just plain hard to play
/me 6burns him
taunt near a turret.
04usually they don't let you get close
Man, they show alot of people in this first episode
I'm currently working on the forum. That's why
04you have to power spin into them, then taunt them into the turret
oh.
yeah makes sense at least
04because without it
unless they're melee too.
6major tweaks?
www.lugia.us/forum
6what happened, exactly?
that link should work by now
04i wish i can well you know
6oh hey it does
just use it all the time on weak enemies
looks like whatever they changed does conflict with some entries in the .htaccess-file and the url-translator we had installed
6so does the main site
04mathmatically
6ok just kidding
6the main page of the main site does
6content doesn't
04hmm
still that would require other minions to not kill them
04i haven't seen very many Amumus
6mhmmhm
04maybe i should learn to play him XD
10It appears there's no reason to get hopes up at this point, heh
04he has fantastic health
04and his abilities are annoying
10...
6TimeShift, no hurry. I can't even imagine how jumbled that would make my brain lol

04LOL
good night, LLOTS!
meh night
I hate anything that stuns.
k, a few links fixed, PLENTY more to go
04Quilava i agree
6O-O
04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/756,IronMumu+%28+Ironman+%2B+Amumu+%29+V1.1
they're cheap too
especially considering when they're LONG stuns
04i'm referring to the customs
04oh stuns
like.. 5s long ones
04many things about LoL is cheap
04stuns
04some ultimates are unfair
mine looks worthless compared to most others :(
04honestly if you ask me Quilava
04knowing where they all are is already such a huge advantage
still
same with pantheon though. he teleports and attacks for lots of damage
oAo for some reason it says my session timed out when I try to post
04at least Pantheon
even though I just clicked on the button to post
6lol
and I never have enough time to escape >.>
I wasn't lingering on the 'post reply' thing either
D: bye Roara~
6actually no, I should get my music all sorted
04i escape every once in awhile
XD
04you can see TF's cards as well

12Awesome night, wish Xai was there
12WOAH
12LOOOOOL
12YOU'RE HOME ALREADY LMAO
YA
6lOL
XD
12^v^ no prob, thanks for the lift
6wait
12No
12XD
6oh LOL
12...
12TST is working ovO
O_O
6Arti, some of it
awesome!
12Oh great :/
6TimeShift has gotten some of it to work
12Wow
12Hi
looks like openNEF ENTIRELY messed up everything
6err
6copypaste fail
12I mean at work when we write our support tickets we make sure to use proper spelling and punctuation....
6that was TimeShift's line
12LOOOOOL
I just can't react in time I guess
that or my ping kills me
03o.o
03the site appears to be working fine now
04my reflexes are horrible
12http://lugia.us/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=112
12http://lugia.us/about-me.htm
04in shooter games
03oh
03yeah it 404s
04i usually die by grenades a lot
03I thought you meant like /forum which works
04my reflexes are that bad XD
oh yeah
umm arti,
12Of course I do Ovo;;;;;
12I use it every day
12At work
oheytstorm
12and on TST
because when you said lunar has a "crappy SQL connection"
!weather 54650
12MySQL I said, and it does
that doesn't really make sense?
03lunamr?
12Connection from pages to Mysql databases
03-m
04is when you are in a gigantic crowd
12It's too slow, same with most "all you can eat" hosts
oh
03all you can eat hosts are awesome for just plain data XD
12Yes
k, top bar is fixed
12Agreed
03I even run like, torrents off it LOL
03I gave myself SSH access :)
03I have gigs of music, videos, pirated warez, etc etc on there
03:P
12Yeh but most people don't
04offensive, defensive doesn't matter
12They just host their personal website or whatever
I have a hard time hitting with it
03www.drfsupercenter.ath.cx <-- personal website
03why would anyone pay for that?
03besides a domain name?
lugia.us/forum is mostly fixed now. All Arti needs to do is fix the Gallery preview in the footer
03I think the point of having unlimited bandwidth is to use it XD
04http://www.leaguecraft.com/skins/278,Sonic+the+Hedgehog+by+Jamesio
04lol
04fail
6Korean HTTYD poster is awesome
12We're not supposed to use /forum though :/
12It's supposed to be http://lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/
:o
When did you come on here? :o
You snuck on!
:D
/me didn't see
03<Articuno> We're not supposed to use /forum though :/ <-- why?
12No haha
03I always use it and never had any problems
http://fukung.net/v/843/060410_hair.jpg
03isn't that technically the host's problem? :P
12No
12It's actually the bridge between the forum and the main site
03so you just failed in writing the site? LOL
12I didn't write the bridge
12It's a bit of software
03o.o
:P
03still, I don't see why you should tell people to use one or the other, they both work fine 99.9% of the time
03and you could just make /forum redirect to the long one if you're that concerned
i good
12No they don't ok?
03if it doesn't work than how come I have never had a single problem with it?
12You dont see why because you haven't worked on the site backend
12Thats nice
u?
12I can't login
12Hold on, it'sok now
12I don;t think I can move the site over easily unless I try tomorrow night
just tested with IE - which had zero contact with TST until now. I could login properly over the main page and switch to the forum
the Logout-Button on the main page works
04Spell Effect
04Toggle: Nearby enemies are drained by 2.3/2.6/2.9/3.2/3.5 (+0.005 per ability power)% of their maximum health each second.
04lol
12It works for me
Logging in via the Main Page also logs me in on the Forum
12*sigh*
12Did the host actually announce this litespeed then?
12did you find anything?
04i like this guys logic
04step 1 - turn on, step 2 - stand next to enemy, step 3 - watch as they fall over and die
12No me neither ¬¬
another reason why we should think about moving to an own server. Especially because of all the size TST is taking over the time
12phone
on our server WE have control over what's installed
12Yes
04Spell Effect
12I'm seriously angry at this but anyway..
12*sigh* I have to go round and edit every single theme index file now to get the forum link to work on the top menu
12:>
I did already
12Problem is there's a million site themes to edit lol
lihttpd/nginx?
12What about it?
12@ junh1024-XDCC
12Oh sorry you're asking which one?
the main thing about lightspeed is: it compresses and prefetches different, throttling most clear-text-pages
oh
12I actually think my host are using the paid for version which is litespeed
12Well anyway..
12I'm a bit worried now, if Litespeed is the future of the web, I don't know if TST can keep up with that :/
12*sigh* I'm logged out of the site again for some reason
ttyl peeps
it's scared of you
12Ok
the "most recent" version of Lightspeed is from January 2009!
the host just bought some pre-configured tins with this up because they wanted to boost performance in exchange for features...
12Yeh lousy host. I can't believe they just DID it one day
12Anyway
/me hugs
12Couldn't have done it without you
/me cuddles back
12I'll try and sort everything out tomorrow
I told you - TST is an important piece for me
12^v^
12Well night and speak to you soon
12night all!
good for now the page's fixed mostly
Wb Aero
Alright... after that minor delay, hello people.

04Brother, it's not my b'day
04but i can't do anything unless i'm near a tower
yeahhh.
Steel or Daedric? :P
04neither
04apparently someone doesn't understand taunt
04well we could of killed someone but my friend runs while he's taunted
04summoner skills i need to put reconsideration into
04i think he NEEDS teleport
04i can't do anything with rammus
04i've gone the first 20 minutes of this match 0/1/0
04how dull
04i call a surrender
04i get 4 against
04someone else calls a surrender they all approve
you've already got a reputation
04i should be gaining respect
you mean surrender the moment its possible
04i never made a wrong prediction lol
04i'll have to get more Riot points to buy more tanks
I thought you said you were going to get yourself banned >.>
04i am but why not spend more money on it
04true
04still
how about earn IP and spend that instead >.>
04i just want people to know for once that i'm more than just a failing idiot
a failing idiot with money?
04can you just forget about the banning and money for one second?
sure
04i don't really want to get banned
04but with how my attitude is right now and how much i'm restraining
04i don't know if i really have a choice in the matter
04i just feel like i'm a bomb that's going to explode and the only way to vent it out is to complain my head off
you could just stop playing and do something else
04i need to practice
04..
04hmm
04and build a tank out of her
everyone does that already
04doesn't really list her as a tank
04but she has incredibly high health
04lol
04i like her ulti
which does?
04basically she chooses a target
04while her ulti is in effect no one else can harm her except her target
lolcheap
explains a lot though
04it does?
when I shoot and they don't take damage
04lol
04i have to agree with you though
04dr. mundo is mean
yeah.
his ult is crazy like that.
his health regen goes up to like 50~100
04sigh
04think think think
04lol did i mention last match
04that was the only reason i died >_>
04i've never done it
actually.. I might have gotten two. not sure
04i'm still sad no one has thought of a Nasus lucario custom skin XD
04lol
04master yi is nasty >_>
04i've seen him work away at towers
04just not fair
heh. back when I used to use him, I took out both nexus turrets with one ult (thats less than 12s by the way) without minions or friendly champs with me
but that makes it balanced!
04i was afraid you'd say that Quilava
04XD
04it's not the first time someone has told me that
gtg Going to my cousin's house
04i need to find someone else i'm good with x-x
especially when I could have easily escaped
04lol
04i've played Tris once
04messes can occur
yeah.
I like that I can knockback people through walls.
04Quilava
04i've been meaning to ask
.....no clue
look it up on the wiki?
04didn't really give io
04*info
04of course that can always change
04hmm
decent
04your character is weak to stun
04so equip clense
04so...
04let's see if i can lose 10 games in a roll now >_>
lol suicide
04yep, from the looks of the matchup
04i say we lost
lol.
matchup means nothing
04it can go either way
04but they play more annoying champions
04you are right though
04what does mean something though is setup
04e
04you don't have to
04they come to you

Because he's arrogant and annoying
there's only one time I've felt bad for him
He always saves the ship though, but that's never good enough for anyone
And he only saves the ship once I've seen
when Data's brother first came into the show
He saved it lots in Season 1
Or had a strong role in saving it

6LOLWUT
Which reference? XD
03they're not just "BLAHBLAH THINGS ONLY 3 YEAR OLDS WOULD GET"
XDD
6oh loool
6I think I remember a blunt statement like that in the 3rd one
That reminds me of the animaniac references
6can't remember which
yup
03yeah
03"Nice ascot"?
/me hides
04hi Quilava
hi
04:)
04how goes
shame they didn't have a spyro movie
gine
*fine
they did they just cancelld it...
04great
04i had a couple interested matches after you slept
04i tried getting used to Nasus
i wanna give those peeps a piece of my mind!
lol
04the highest i ever got was like +80 something
that takes a lot of time.
and 80 is pretty decent
200 on a regular hit
03you know
03like the little microphone thing
03and the snake
03etc
03XD the toy soldiers using the baby monitor
03that too
04yeah
ive been waiting 4 that movie to come out sinse 2008 when i herd about it
04i learned the trick
I rememebr those :O
same
I still have those too XD
:( stinks
the first blood record doesn't work D:
04first blood record?
click on the champion you've used most on the right
and it'll say 'total first blood = 0' even if you've gotten some
04what does Penta kill mean
12You really can't do much with Sparx...
aka, kill the entire team
12But, whatever....
no
04btw
03yeah
04i had a feeling were going to lose this match but everyone is like
and tall plains
03XD
and put in two cooler places
04"we've come back from worse" not beliving them i continued to do my best only to prove them wrong
04they won by a mere split second
lol
04i really got a kick out of that
04actually
04we would of won
they would have won if you weren't their teammate is my guess
04*who was
04along with a teemo
darn...still only 62
Hi
its very possible.
happens quite often supprisingly
04i did my best, like i promised
04actually it was my mistake we lost that one
04if we attacked the nexus earlier we would of easily won
03XD more grownup humor
that too
03"The word I'm looking for, I can't say, because there's preschool toys present"
XD
04yet i don't see it counting
I've gotten like.. 3 total
12good
04i got 1
hmm
u could fly to
04was the first blood stat always there?
w/ sparx
probably
no I've seen it before
04ok
04that rules out my theory then
03and here comes my favorite scene in the movie
12oops
03o/` Straaaange things, are happening to me o/`
12*godly shoutbox appears*
and I think I might actually be starting to get good
04at level 6
*my
04actually with Nasus's ultimate it's easy
6little binoculars
03yeah those too
03XD
6but didn't the voice actor for his die?
12what movie are you watching?
03no
03Toy Story
123?
03no, the first one
03but I do have a bootleg of the 3rd :P
03yes
"well umn aofgwslfbsofgaofgvdkagbdaghdoiahgdikagdlshndk"

04i've heard of people doing it
12:)
6RC is gone
Back :D
6that was one of my fav caracters
03oddly enough in the third movie they actually WANT to go in the attic :P
04i don't think its worth it
03yeah
:D
12I like Jessie
03I liked the binoculars
04like you said it takes too long
6same
at higher levels maybe, when you can kill it fast
03if you weren't a girl I would make a joke
/me runs
12and the bo peep doll *shot*
the 130g would be really nice
04which is a disadvantage in more than one way
6.......lol
03Jessie isn't even hot, I mean seriously
/me runs
04it means you are likely to fall more behind in laning
03even the toys look kinda crappy
04at level 6
6drf yeah
6the VA for the binoculars died
yeah
03hm
03oh
6same for the penguin

03hm
6squeeze wut
04that's why when i jungled with WW
the pengiun I think
03there's a character named Squeeze, apparently
03ah

04and played against TF, i told my team-mates i want to know the very second TF hits level 6

6^lenny's line
6one of em
03oh

04:)

6phatommmmm
/me shot
03XD
03why
Phantom Menance
Sari: How are you today?
Wut
6Dennis the Menance

03like when he calls Hannah
03how come they don't just talk around people?
03like is there some "law"
Yes
6breaks the rules of nature
03that they can't come alive in the presence of h8umans?
6:P
03-8
03XD
03but I mean
03why wouldn't they be defiant and just do it
But then heres a more interesting fact
03like even Buzz
6well, if you're supposedly on an alien planet
03LOL "Years of Academy trainer, wasted"
03*training
03I'd be like "PLease don't hurt me"
12i'd run
actually he'd use someone as a distration to escape
03or that
12apparently toys
12are like fainting goats
12they see something that scrares them and fall over
Ok,y ou
03XD
6LOL FAINTING GOATS
6Those things are awesome
I misread that was
Fainting Ghosts
Hey Sari :)
12*scares
lol
04i tested it out on nasus
/me coughs
I know lol
I just noticed
Hi
Pride's eyes are now purplish
04just like me
048D
04i can't wait for level 20
I've gotten 2 wins today in less than 25 mins each
04i'm just going to go wild on buying tier 3 runes
04i wish people would see it my way more
04if a match looks hopeless
if it looks hopeless, win, and rub it in the opponents face
03OK how do like 9 year old kids order explosive rockets?
its like the phieus and ferb thing
03I don't watch that show
"Arent you a little young to handle a intercontiental balistic missile?"
04could of been spent on another match you'll win
"Yes, yes I am"
04kk
*dont
04someone made an interested point
04that you don't get as much experience if you surrender
04but that can't than 10-15 experience lost
03so where did it come from?
12it's a silly kids movie :P
03because I'mw atchin git
03*watching it
12hmm
03Buzz ripped the sticker off his arm
12you are just like seto kaiba
03and it comes back later on
12you are grown up
6...it does
6?
03Yes
6LOL
6I never paid attention to that
03yeah me neither
03but now taht I'm wathcing it again
03LOL Binford
03Home Improvement reference XD
that's a third of losing experience
45 to 30
03and they advertised Binford tools
also I'm not leaving quite yet.. still gotta wash some clothes >.>
poor fu
04oh
04even if you lose half experience
04i don't think its worth it
03about not coming alive around humans LOL
14XD
meh
04:)
04surrendering a match is a polite thing to do
I thought you just did it to spite them
6forgot how epic this movie was
6music <3
SHINEN
04there is more than one reason for it :P
02o3o
6I-
6yeah
6I've got all 3
XD
DVDs?
I bet you dont have totoro :P
6but I bought the 10th anniversary as DVD
6the last two are vhs
6brother, I used to have totoro on vhs
6lost it
I have all VHS
6....
:O
6oh crap
6I was going to say I have it on file on my laptop
XD its hilarious you seem to have mostly all the movies I have
6which is now unusable LOL
XD
meh
"Totoro DENIES YOU"
Same
Wait
I'm thinking of this one Movie..
NEMO
not the fish one
the other Nemo
the..dream wisher thing
I still have those
or prequels
02I like how some sequels are prequels
02Like Tarzan 2
Or that Little Mermaid 3 movie
02I've seen the beginning of it XD
14http://jiayi.deviantart.com/art/Pigeons-168353941 <--- <33
03sigh, headache
USA GOT PWNED
k?
and?
usa sucks
lol wut
At soccer?
derp.
02OhEspeon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzvZz3ff8ks&NR=1
6its
6a
6SA
/me 6tackles high-speed
Alek yeah
6:3
/me dies
6LOL
Mrr
6sora was one of my camp nicknames
XD
6skittles was first though
WUT
6*hate
Was it become you went over the rainbow?
6lmo
6we had a skittle fight first day of camp
XD
02...
"oh look its the Skittle machine that walks! :O"
I keep watching this scene over and over again for some odd reason..
Maybe its because Father is one of the only villains that actually succedes in his plans
for 10 seconds
3 mins!
then gg usa
:D
"hey RAWR"
14I'm just saying. That's how I would make people do it. XD
1 min!
/me 14hides.
other then Lelouch or the Emperor
lopl
onoz?
3 more mins!
:D
Then Father dies. *nod*
02Aka: The little friend from the flask
in the anime they alwaycall him "little thing in the flask; homonculus"
02That's because those are all his names XD
02His actual name is Homonculus
02But goes as Father
LOL remember the time he mocks hohenhiem?
k.
"wait..you're not to bright...maybe Hohenhiem?"
02And Hoenheim calls him "My little friend in the flask"
he is very little
kinda ironic how Pride in 2003 kills Pride in 2009
USA GOT PWNED!!!!
02Pride wasn't Pride though in 2003
02Pride was Wrath
/me pokes Quilava
02And Wrath was Izumi's kid
and sloth was a woman :O
we lost
yeah the main thing I never got with the 2003 anime, is the names
6wut
14Well I won't be reading FMA anymore... :/
Sloth isnt slothish
6...
6LOL
Wrath seems whiny XD
6Brave little toaster references the pixar "A113" joke
hi quil :)
14Whut?
whats up?
wanna play some ? :)
YES
she did
she wanted "imortality"
can't right now. need to keep up on laundry and then I have to bathe. we're going somewhere later
okis :)
She meant the FMA manga has ended
there's probablly a few more episodes left
14If you're counting the whole "Brotherhood" series, then I'm not talking about that.
I dont even think Bleach is even worth continuning XD
seriously, nearly..what 200 episodes have gone?
02http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs37/f/2008/242/9/f/StupidFox___2_by_SilentReaper.jpg
(though that doesnt beat one pieces 400 freaking episodes >>)
02I've read all of the FMA manga
02Bleach makes no sense to me, I ask hundreds of questions about the logic behind it
though it takes a few things out of the manga
02And I think One Piece is one of the longest mangas I've seen yet, but I still keep up to date on it
02Same with Naruto
I use wikipedia to make sure it is XD
02Why hopefully?
It seems boring again
02Some parts can be a bit tough to get through, but I believe it's a great anime/manga
02For One Piece?
Yes
6so
02There's over 500 chapters in the manga XD
I check funimation to watch FMA Broherhood
02I think it's 539
XD
well their close
Eh, I'd go with sub. Funimation redubbed it but I'd rather not watch any 4kids dubs
12Arti
12:3#
I just hope thye chose the best voice for Pride
Wrath
and Greed
6it'sablueburd
/me 6nibbles artitail
6ITS TAIL
I know
though they're probablly at episode..20
maybe
Selim Bradley comes at episode 32
Pride comes in later
earlt 40s
Yeah, they aren't far in. I didn't bother watching because Al's voice was disgusting
Eds voice is the same as the old anime
thats probablly the only thing I remember XD
I remember the old Mustang
6this movie traumitized me when I was little
6I remember this part x-x
Oooh, I thought you meant the Warehouse 13 thinger
"jeese mustang you sure are manic today"
No not that XD
little toaster arti
12Wtf
6brother, the junkyard scene
Yep
6I've been terrified of magnet lifters ever since
that scene was the moment of "ARG Not this again"
6how the heck is this movie even called a kids movie LOL
6fff I cry at everything
02Maybe a teen movie then?
6although
OK dont watch Come and See
By all that is emotional
6because there's no music
D:
Monster XD
/me dies
02No matter how many times I watch that scene I always tear up
Come and See made me cry for several reasons
1; showed dozens of people die
2; its just depressing
Homeward Bound for me :P
3; its Byelorussia during the Great Patriotic War
6hmm....while this movie is creepy, they got quite a few good voices for this song
6HOMEWARD BOUND
6FFFFFFF I was crying buckets
I have never attempted to watch that movie, EVEr since I got it
for I knew I'd cry
6lunies
6that yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFfDhXXoP0k
6but also when he fell
This scene is the most traumatic for me
6and when he stopped climbing back up
6and when sissy went over the falls
6and when she met back up
That, too!
6and when they were left at the ranch
6pretty much all through the movie XD
whats other movies that are depressing at all levels..
anyone watch dumbo/
*?
Of course
I never liked it as much
6I hate dumbo
6scared me when I was little
oh the backward history scene :D
very emotionally hatred this scene is
Not a children's film but Enough made me cry
which?
addicting though
Fly Away Home, too
wait..
People say it's stupid, but I loved it
and the girl
Yesss
I've seen it
i think I have it
6hmm
6what shall I have for lunh
6lunch
Beef jerky?

that site is evil >:|
I can't be myself there because all my "friends" would think I'm too nerdy, which I am.
That's why
and yourself would be..?
Yep
But there, I can't be
Why?
I have to be like everyone else is
but I understand the 'image' concept though I dont go by it
I'm 15 too you know >>
And that's why
I don't know
then they're not connected
But if my real friends aren't there, then why am I?
What's the point
Because you either chose to be or were forced to
the point is something entirely different
Well, both really.
How were you forced to join a site?
let me guess for him:
peer pressure?
o.o;
wow....THAT is unusual...
I know
Then it isnt forced

kinda interesting they never do talk about Dante's poem in church
04probably because their view of 'hell' is different
I thought it was always based on a 9 circle ever since then?
oh, I'm here now. didn't see the news but I heard a bit about it. didn't realize it was that bad though o.o
2not always
2it's becoming more popular to say that "hell" is eternal separation from God
other then a firey pool of suffering
2no, just of isolation

2you DO realize how large Christianity is, right?

that word
LOL its a swear in england sorry
wb^2 Brother
02Where are you travelling to, Arti? O_o
/me is back.
Arti: HOW XD
my parents housr
It used to mean "drunk"
well like damn is a swear to Americans but not here
I'm on 118 channels, across 20 networks. I have 16 olines, 25 owners, 47 admins, 56 ops, 3 halfops, and 24 voices. I have abusive power over 725 people.
DRF
12arti
04wb NS
12apparently XD
drf's mum goes nuts about the word "hell'"
more like one town
in Michigan
since she's a Pycho-logist
/me runs
Arti: A.D.?
02thanks
02XD
but then thats 'kid' shows
and, probably
but then kid shows various
12it's a mild swear
from mindless/stupid propaganda that has no worth or mean to exist
and then actual shows that use it subtly
lol well I was told off for using it on tst forums and people replace it with stars a lot
/me np: BS eien no ongaku - Anime shudaika daizenshuu 2005 -Audio Version-: Yoko Takahashi - Zankoku na Tenshi no Teeze 02:39m mp3@224kbps
XD
only Americans though
(AKA 1940)
it used to mean such
lolpoliticalcorrectness
we use it as drunk all the time here
kinda like gay?
No
@brother
its common to say "we're gonna get peesed tonight "
that term has a different story
though, kinda same thing
/me plans to draw more dragons over vacation in 2 weeks
also pees means urine
I think 'gay' used to mean burning sticks or some form of that
04dragons
lingistics can be complicated
dray-gawns

04have a sense of humor
04I do
02o.o
04spam is subjective
02:)
04._.
04oh
/me is a girl
02I mean
/me SHOT
04so spam irritates you
04but something like that doesn't
04yes
04i see how it is now
02How likely is it for us to end up as a couple?
/me is offended and storms off
04uh
04dunno
04considering the chances of actually meeting IRL, plus the chances we'll see each other for an extended period of time...
04not good
02I hope you know whether I'm joking or not
04yeah
04I know
04that
04you're joking
04oh?
02:)
02I'm still the only girl good enough for you.
04haha
04'good enough'
04gack
04please, if I'm to get ANY girl I need really low standards
04romance
/me adverts eyes
04now that is spam
02You ATTRACT everyone
04hahaWUT
02See it this way
02You're the negative charge
02boys are positive
02I mean
02girls are positive
02see
02XD
02FFF
04loooool
04I expected that
02that damned pun
04lol
02.-.
02And in our school magazine quotes last year
02this asian teacher was like
02It made me lol
'ror'
04lol
02XD
04NS
04that's just one factor
04and besides, we see plenty of people proving that factor wrong today
04I mean, really
04how would you define 'love'?
04(hey look I'm getting phylosophical)
some convoluted system I want nothing of
02Depends on HOW you want me to define it
04what do you think it is?
+=05.34.46=+ some convoluted system I want nothing of
02Do you mean the 'word' or 'feeling'?
04the feeling
02Well
02I haven't really 'felt' 'love' before
02Okay
02I'll put it this way
04love is just spam
/me uses /clear
02I'm guessing it's the euphoric feeling when you suddenly have a desire for someone and some side effects are lightheadedness, constant thinking about them, and generally getting distracted
02And no
02a disease
04hmm
02Though really
02'Love' is very vague
04Considering that, I personally don't have a definition for it
04true
02It's a "feeling"
02It's not a solid object or thing
04but I see where you're coming from
02lol
02Love != chemicals/hormones
02lol
02o-o
04lol
o.o
i don't "love"
04oh the cliche

04Yay...Germany scored
Ã².Ã´
04I'm supporting Germany through the rest of this match
04Cos my countries unsporting T_T...
LOL TimeShift
04I sense a riot comiiiiing.
/me decides to prefer other countries other than his own
12Wtf are you doing Tuffy!? England are playing excellently this time!!
04Really?
04Pfff.
04I know.
04I know it's you Arti.
04Srsly though, sometimes I just...Disapprove how my country reacts to footbal
LOL TimeShift and Arti
04Wayne Rooney spewing offense to his supporters
another thing I like about us: We may have quite many and wild fans, but "hooligans" are a typical english phenomenon
04Too right.

04Ok, England have been humiliated enough, quit the replay.
;D
I like england. Some of the food may be odd, but the countryside is wonderful. Plus I know some good friends on this continent :)
12timeshift, this is xai, did you see that the germans were around 3m offside when they scored. the officials suck in this match
04It's full of anti-social behavior, especially where I am.
04In fact in MY STREET, and I'm not kidding, some jackass was having a cannabis farm...
lol
if you're standing right, the ball is played and one of the players can run faster than the rival, it's ok
04Thats not motivational.
sidenote: About 50 people stood at the train station and watched the thing happening - without even calling the police
04*facepalm*
12timeshift, when the ball was kicked they were offside
04Eitherway, we live in a messed up world.
really? Guess I missed that scene here.
04England lost already
GOOOAAALLLL!!!!
12F***!!!!!!!!
now THAT was NOT offside :P
12no that was a good goal
04Well, I cant watch anymore of this torment.
04I'm gonna go on my Xbox
04We all are.
that's why I volunteered as one of our company's first-aid helpers and donate for local pet protection institutions
04Good for you. And I wasn't being sarcastic.
Counter-Goal
12YESSSSSSSS

12YES##
12ES

12YES

12WATCH THE REPLETYS

12WTF HOW CQAN HE BE THAT BLIOND
saw it
12cOME ON TimeShift even you saw that right???
04Oh, did it not count?
12:((((((((
I saw it, yes
04HAHAHAHAHA!
12They just did a replay and it went in, perfectly..
04I thought some dumbass would come with an excuse
12why do we always be cheated out of a win
12i woulden't mind if we lost fairly
04Cos Football
04SUCKS
04BALLS
12we're always cheated
04That's why
04We're full of unsporting jackasses
or he suffered a brain damage due to this constant vuvuzela-crap
04Im playing Halo
12LOL!!!!
haaah - found the second sound channel on my television transmission: They run a filter over it to get rid of this sh*t
04better than that football bulcrap
definately NOT
12XD
12XD
You know, all I can say is GAY
04Cos Football is scum of the world
04The football fans, (most of them) are the offspring of scum
12Those scum ruin it for all of us Tuffy
04Damn right they do
04Anyway
04I just had fun
04Playing something else!
04Football should be forbidden
12they must be bent.
how can a team be cheated by watching the others play?^^
12we have been cheated out of many
12remember argentina?
rofl
12that is good. Germans have good sportsmanship
^
12that linesman needs firing
Over a foot past the line in the replay <<<
12how can you be at that level of playing and be that inept
12over a yard actually
12bbc did a freeze frame and it was a yard
Either way it shouldn't of been disallowed
Anyway I'm off to the pub for the second half, laters all
04It wont be
04Football is never fair =3
04Lmao
04Pokemon
04Yugioh maybe
Heya pplz~
Talking about the football match? Or something entirely different?
12if 50,000 people, germans english, everyone can see and 1 linesman cannot then he is not suitable to be a linresman
12in fact i think he saw it fine but is bent. i can't believe that he missed it genuinely
12no
I'd like to refer to it as "the card game"
and not a single one was a real foul
12TRhat was REALLY close..
12we're really going for it
GOAL!
12noooooooooooooooooooo
Apparently, the match turned into a mass free-for-all wrestling match
Germany
England
12Ok I'm going to admit defeat now..
12xai's not
Singapore's nuts
*Singaporeans
game's still going for at least 25 minutes
if we count the overtime
AFTER that we can admit defeat or victory. But not before this
*was
Like France in 2002

Unless you've got an acoustic, then they'll toughen up faster
Well, based on my experience with an electric/light gauge strings, I've played for 3 months and I can still only play for about 2 hours before I need a break'
fail ai
lol
I've got an acoustic
yeah that's why I've got one
:)
Yeaaaah, dad-moochers, unite!
Oh wait
lol
we;ve got like...10 guitars in the house
I'm not entirely sure if he'll actually give me this one
Oh wow... spare one for the poor?
but he gave it to me to learn on
this is actually a nice one, his other acoustic is a 12 string
03False_ai
as for the 3rd acoustic...I haven't the slightest idea where it is
12 string, wow
yeah
it's pretty intense
I would imagine
all 12 strings together sounded awesome xD
too lazy to screw with nickserv xD

We have a tournament script which can be used by moderators, Gameboo
it starts a tournament on the server

That too, Gameboo
I was thinking of that
But we need moar people first
Something spread out over a few weeks
I intend to make the email philosophy@ho-ohrealm.net
that forwards to both our emails
Can someone send me the text color script?

Quantum Physics is a <censored>
02god damn philosophy
Quantum Physics is not a bad thing.
04np;\
04ffff
04freaking up key
04:|*
02o.o
02well it's annoying, Xeli
02especially when you have to 'accept matter doesn't exist'
02which I don't get the point of
02I don't have an opinion of matter anyway
02and when you get down to string theory
02and you find that people believe everyone/everything is made of tiny vibrating strings of energy
02and a calculation that solves everything
02you go 'wtf how can a maths equation solve everything as well as determine extra dimensions'
02so woo, my mind is on a rollercoaster
well I find it fascinating
how everything is determined on a scale that we can't comprehend
02I think particle theory makes moar sense
04..wut
/me sticks to the fantasy theory kthnxbai
/me shot
02lolwut
02that typically IS fantasy
02in a way
02but it hasn't really been proved
02just makes me wtf
02it makes sense at least
02and it happens every now and then or something like that
02so wonderful
02course there's a lot
02but that's kinda crazy
04like plenty other things I turn unfunny
02I still like the idea that we're 3 dimensional creatures and can only see things in 3 dimensions
4 dimensions if you count time
02well yeah, 4 dimensions
04._.
02More than one universe makes sense
02string theory does not
well too bad our brain can't comprehend more than 4 dimensions then
02yeah
well it stops being logical once you enter the realm "quantum physics"
that's why it's not just "physics" |D
/me shot
02true
02walking through walls would be fun
02but technically
04Omniscience?
02Quantum physics is alright
02I don't like string theory that much though
02I find the idea of AUs alright
02but really
I actually find the whole theory that every choice creates alternate universes quite interesting.
whoever comes up with random <censored> about OUR universe is a loony cock
infinite universes = the word "x doesn't exist" is invalid
02ok
02disregard that
lol WUT
02I'm ranting
02BUT
02there's stilll some really retarded theories out there
02compared to them, string theory actually makes sense
02well
02not really
02but there's also this quote "If you think you understand string theory, you don't"
the theory that the world is an advanced computer simulation is weird.
02but then again
02Drake
02Apparently that's one of the theories
04:|
02Every choice you make creates an alternate dimension
universe
02in which you would have made a different choice
02well
02universe yeah
02AU
02which is an alright statement
because infinity really screws up logic
02yep
04ah
04well
02that's sums it up really
04this entire convo is screwing up my mind
02Drake
04so I'm just gonna idle
02you DON'T do philosophy like I do
04no
04do*
02Anyhow
04Nightshadow
02That also reminds me of time travel
04my school is catholic
04Religion replaces Philosophy
02apparently the further you go
LOL
In Norway that sort of schools = illegal
04great
i never understood why. they try too hard xD
It's fun when the parties that rule have wildly different meanings on immigration

/me 2sits on Sheena
12o-o
12i still don't know if i want AVG or Avast
I prefer AVG myself
10I wish I could get back into the TCG :/
Avast is too... simplistic
AVG gives you more options
12heh
12hijackthis
12was complex
lol
/me now belongs to Espeon for 15 minutes
and why not get back into it? o.o
also yes
12i know
10well, it costs money to collect the cards
LOL indeee
d3
10I'd rather be spending it on other things
04not if you use a program like redshark
04XD
o.o
12i guess one thing that irritates me with avast
well merp gtg
heh
I didn't use it long enough for that to happen
04http://pokebeach.com/tcg/redshark
10I don't mean to actually play though lol
/me just collected the cards
12what about AVG?
04oh
AVG only made me reboot twice
in the past year
14AVG sucks
orly
and Avast is just eh
14No it isn't
my work uses Trend Micro, but that's kinda retarded
because I use autorun
to give it a custom icon and whatnot
EWW
no they aren't
14Bs
McAfee is a plain failure
It lets viruses by and blocks everything else -_-
12i think
12out of all the people i asked
14AVG Killed my laptop at one point
LOL
12everyone said AVG sucks
12except DRF
ATI killed my desktop at one point
but everyone says ATI is good
yeah
12apple killed my computer at one point
LOL
yes, but you can get them back
and I'd rather be safe than sorry
12drf no joke
14Tell that to my laptop
McAfee deletes them *permanently*
12i used to have an ipod
you can restore them
14McAfee gives you an option
14>>
orly?
no it doesn't
14Yes
14It does
we had it at my work last year
I plugged in an external hard drive
12since that day
bam, half the drive got deleted
14It's a setting
12my systemtray has permanently vanished
and the computer has McAfee
you're f***ed.
14...
point being
12that's why
12you download and install 3 Antiviruses :D
14I don't use any of em anymore
LOL no
LLOTS, same
I disabled AVG LOL
It's just there as an on demand scanner
as is Malwarebytes
it's nice to ahve them installed, but not running
12i dunno
12avast has helped me plenty of time with its realtime scanners
but I got mad at one point because I got a keygen that kept getting deleted LOL
12yay
12so much for AVG
12instead of being safe from viruses
LOL
12*mother
and never bothered to turn it back on

12i said i smell a rat
12because the dehalop

6LOL
6dehalop WUT
6where's the f
03So I got a ripped $5 bill and the security strip was hanging out and I was curious and it just, well, popped out
12it'd range from 2 to like 8 seconds
eggdrops and etc can have settings which automatically remove modes
03Hi xD
/me 6is tempted to kick StatsBot just for revenge
14XD
10Yeah XD
/me 6glares at Draelen
14It's probably Draelen messing around :P
StatsBot is run by arti as far as I know
if I tell chanserv to voice me:
6Arti's at the beach today though
14Draelen: You still have access to botserv and operserv :P
I cannot make others talk
without a module installed
/me can't put it back D:
14Draelen: YOU OWN one of the servers for TST
14:P
/me isn't silly
6llots of course you're silly
/me 6runs
14inb4 /msg operserv mode #channel modes
14;P
12lol
14You can still use operserv to use botserv access :P
yes, but I can't make modes originate from StatsBot, which was happening earlier
14VNC
/me shot
I have no VNC access ;p
I only ask for those details if I'm helping arti with something
14lol
you'll see that sendraw is not installed ;p
or at least it should not be
2whee
2Drawing Twil's sona is fun :D
you do ;p
anyone does
DDD:
/operserv raw :StatsBot MODE #SilverWings -o Draelen
that however works
Maybe you could take them both to a bank or something and have it be exchanged maybe? XD
if you run /stats T, you'll see "wrong direction 5 empty 19"
and is ignored

hm?
04funny thing happened, >_>
04i'm sitting here near the end of the match
04the person i laned with was a gangplank
hi and ew - still no Cuno here
04and he complained about someone stealing his kill
04my record was 4/2/12 because of him XD
lol
she was here earlier looking for you XD
04complained about 1 kill being taken from him
04i didn't care
04i just laughed it off
...
...and I was at the airschool
learning how an altimeter, a turn indicator and such works
but still
04i'm starting to get used to nasus
04he is just mean as heck
good for teaming I suppose
04keeps them away from farming while helping you farm as well
:o
04perhaps
its got a pretty large area
04wither has a LARGE area as well
is it AoE?
04no
04i'm just saying it has a lot of range
04i know
04really
04the only problem i have with Nasus is that i'm never sure when to whip out the ultimate
04not really
04i mean look at teemo
04i think nasus is among the hardest though
2 o-o
04i usuall use it for defense
04like if i think i'm going to die, i whip out the ultimate with hopes of surviving
doesn't work well against anything with range though
04i wear boots of swiftness
wb quil :P

04then to be even more safe i equip clense

ty
my netbook screen has optimized tiny xchat

14Seriously that isn't helping
14also for those that actually care my server is back up and running
14irc.starlightdragon.co.cc 9001
LLOTS: delete the account?
14Delete waht account?
If you want it to actually go away, you have to delete it
which is sort of convoluted
14I disable it
and yeah.. 'disable' is the same as 'log out and don't come back'
14Yeah Quilava
14I'll do that
DELETE the account
14Facebook pisses me off anyway
14Guys I really don't care :\
I don't know the situation, just randomly looked over here and thought I'd try to help sort of xD
how come?
Good relative evening peoples.

probably some word in their language you'll never guess
yeah probably
14Everyone is being rude!
/me shot
I've seen plenty of interesting words
RDX: yeah that's the one :D
kind of odd that after we all start joining they set a key
=/
14Everyone is quiet D:
squeak
because Americans are evil
:P
:P
I forgot
lok, I'm still in there
Woah cool
:P
prolly wouldn't go over very well lol
:P
we had a group of like 4 people doing that
besides it's prolly just Allah Haffiz or something
Yeah, probably not
XD
yeah
or something along those lines
But a supervisor told me to let the men to it :(
:(
0.o
SEXIST!
lol Wal Mart
:P
I work alongside a Minnesota equivalent of you RDX
XD
XD
ironic
I bet you would've been able to figure it out way faster
probably lol
12hmm
And keep in mind this was with step-by-step instructions
/me gives Kipikipo some lettuce
XD
XD
It's simple really
I saw them still there like an hour later
/me balances on it
etc.
well, it was a little more complicated than that
for the controllers I guess
yeah
since they can't be wireless
And some thing called a "Medusa"
whatever that is
Hmm
:O
The Coke vendor
lol
he comes in every week
must be a convenient store
All Coke vendors are RDX
:P
nah, Walmart
then he should be in there every day
not once a week
oh yeah
he probably is
14XD
I never pay much attention because I don't directly work with him
and no
lol
12and cheesecake
maybe the one I work with is good looking
I dunno
O.o
why not?
okaaayyy then XD
14Orly
14:P
/me blegh...
I'll have to ask a female coworker if he is
while part timers work weekends
I'd look crazy
"omigawd ya like totally"
lol, all my female coworkers are like 60
XD
LOL
OK, maybe not then :P
^_^
there are a couple younger ones I think
all the ones I see all the time are old though
literally everyone on my team smokes
too bad 95% of the chicks in my town are ugly bats
except for one other person
Hahahaha
RDX: XD that does suck
they're all ugly bats or they all smoke?
smoke
and probably ugly bats
haha
but they can't help that
they're too old
::P
:::::P
Mine has more eyes than yours
Mine has gla censored cat sses
Why does Wal Mart put the people with the worst looking teeth as greeters?
LOL
LOL
I dunno
seriously
it disturbs me
here they just give that job to the handicapped
Because old people have bad teeth
I never noticed their teeth
not just old people
And only old people ever work there
actually
Maybe it's because they smoke
probably
because all Walmart employees smoke too
Why, I have no idea
it really does seem that way
D:
just stand in one place for 4 hours at a time and say goodbye to people
but yeah, that's still not much to do
And stop shoplifters occasionally
hey
Speaking of Walmart shoplifters
The other member of the walmart crew has arrived
hi infa z
Infamous, I'm gonna start working on an anime version of a CBL during my lunch breaks
huh?
whats going on?
lol wtf
ha
this was a random idea he had while driving me home yesterday
don't ask me :P
lol, and after thinking upon it more it seems genious
Lol, it's impossible to track my train of thought
that just brings phinox right up into my head

A computer maybe
/me DEFINATELY goes nows
xD
My current laptop is a powerhouse with an i5, ATI radeon 5750, and 4GB ram.
And I spent those 2 hours watching a webstream with another irc client
How about a portable alternative that I can sleep with.
03Droid/
/me hides
12Droid is the best alternative
I still have another year on my contract
AT&T
And it's a crappy free phone
With an even worse touch screen than any iPhone.
Capacitive, as technical minded people call it.
That's the iPhone
And the other kind is transistive, that's like the ds
And that's my phone
Besides that, I don't think my parents would even pay any more than 30 a month for a phone.
03Droid IS 30 a month
03anyway

6HOLY CRAP V-MAX
that looks... vertical
6only, OPEN
V-Max?
6drf, I've ridden a slide like that
6it was called v-max
oh
6most epic waterslide ever
/me OMFGs at DRF's pic
I wanna ride one
6 9 stories tall, near vertical drop
NICE
6guarenteed wedgie at the end
XD
14I would never ride anything like that...
same XD
hi Aero
hai J!
I would! XD
14It looks like someone could fall right off!!
6SA, I said that for the longest time
6I chickened out and then realized something
http://epicwinftw.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/129159992359987275.jpg
6I'd have to climb 9 stories back down
6or spend 4 seconds sliding
6the slide was way more fun once you got on XD
14Yes, but I'm afraid of falling...
6the one drf posted was open though...
6v-max was closed for the first half of the slide
only I didnt know how tall this ride was
6the second half was open
oh
open
I thought you meant like
open for business
you'd have to go up some 10 sections of stairs
/me omgs
i could imagine XD
but worth it, down virticully and go in all different directions
/me 14shivers.
14sounds horrible
6man, I can't even show you an image of the slide
its fun-orrible
hm?
why?
6see, the park closed down in 2004, and it seems that NO ONE bothered to take pictures before then and put it online >_>
oh
>>
did they close down due to any deaths or injuries on that slide?
thats lame
/me hies
*hides
6that park was the best waterpark E-V-E-R
drf: NRH2O, had several dehydrations

lol how time works XD
and eyes tend the be the hardest part for most people =/
03oh, this is just great
03TBS is the ONLY station that doesn't work :(
03For me
03I get picture but no sound
lol yeah
and why doesn't TBS work for you?
03Dunno
03I had the cable company over here TWICE
03They're like "It's not our fault"
03and was like
03that's not our fault
03>_>
meh
cable companys
03well
03I REALLY hate Turner networks' HD channels at times
03as they fricking stretch everything :@
03when they aren't
03>_>
03same with Home Improvement, TBS *RUINED* That
which is the sad truth a lot of the time
03Yeah -_-
03my friend was like
03I was like um, yes?
I have Dish, they're an okay company
03EW SATELLITE
EW DRF
I have antenna >:V
03XD
03yeah, over the air is cool
03anyway
03http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2010/6/29/0cf49c5d-5289-4f60-b2b6-574007c7b8c4.png
We had cable
03well I hvae reasons for hating satellite companies
it sucked
03I mean
03cable is kinda evil too
03BUT
03There's benefits
03we have like 4 TVs
03:)
03if you have satellite, good luck with that LOL
XD yeah
03you also can't do that with satllite
03so yeah
03I have my reasons
I didn't ask for it
i hate it too
03with cable you only need one if you want HD
i know -.-
03and since we only have one HDTV
recording via computer on sattelite is doable
03how?
03in HD?
03I just put a cablecard in my computer
03Satellite doesn't use cablecards
03:P
03you'd have to pay for a receiver
03then use some obscure method
03to do it
"splitter", for one
they make those :0
03Alek, splitter how?
03...
03the problem with that
03you can only watch one chanenl
03*channel
03my grandparents do that LOL
03they have Dish, and like 3 TVs
03and they can only watch one station
I don't mean split to two TVs
03on any given TV
03...
you're watching the program anyway
03oh
03not really
03Often times I record one thing as I'm watching something else at the same time
03:P
03well regardless
03you still need to record it through the analog hjole or whatever
03-j
03I can do it with cable :P
we don't have sattelite anymore, anyway
03we never had it, XD
my parents were thinking of getting a TiVo, which I was trying to get them to not do because I was saying I could just build a system that does basically the same thing
03literally, when my parents bought the house back in 1987, the previous owners had Comcrap
03and were like here, just pay for it if you want it
03so they did
we had cable when I was young, and it went out every time there was a drizzle
03XD
lol I remember cable at my dads old house
03and back in around 2002 we switched to WideOpenWest
03and never went back
03WOW is quite an awesome cable company :)
And they don't service my area

03sad partr is I lost my PokéWalker shortly after making it :(
6lol you lost it?
03yes
03like
03I was spinning it around on my finger
03and accidentally let go
03never seen it since
6where were you spinning it?
6and....how fast ._.

Dracula is, depening on the film, on the "awesomeness" scale, somewhere between: "Woah!" and "Holy <bleep>!" :P

I'm a lion if that helps
I got somethin to show him and he's not even here? >:/
it shows he's here, but he's probably AFK

Well they cross paths with a wild Camerupt and it starts to charge at them
then raindance happens and stops the Camerupt from charging?
no
Ash was surprised that thunderbolt didn't work
._.
meow
maybe he simply never learned
/me hides
;P
;p
but still
Again, after 4 seasons of battling, he still has no idea XD
I KNOW LOL
I mean
he uses Thunderbolt on EVERYTHING.
haven't seen it
then again i haven't seen any of the newer movies
There's a part where a hole appears in the sky
the showers did
it beat a rydon directly
See, in the older seasons/episodes, he had a stupidity but most people let it off because he was either knew to the battle system
via it's horn
and piplup
Me: WTF?!
Yet he takes down Legends.
I find that hard to believe XD
He actually WON one of them?
same
He always wins rounds one and two
Past that
OSH I LOST HOW WHY BAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWW
Because
YOU SUCK
Every frikkin time
>>
well he's never "beaten" a legend he mostly runs, dies, or triggers a plot event
most are
hi
XD
Yeah that's retarded
Oh yes
YES
Chronicles was decent
ya
Compared to the show it was amazing
/me runs
Take for example Alabama's govenor campaign
ya
Compared to the manga it was nothing
|D
They are
I loved the manga
never found a decent copy of the manga
they even made fun of it on Tosh.o
You can find it on OneManga.com
Or at least, that's how I read it
Now he's doing the same to his opponent in the running for Arizonan govenor and the ad is all over the place. It looks like it was cut and edited by a middle schooler because it litterally comprises of other commercials being cut and pasted together. XP
didn't see it on mangafox didn't try mangaone
Arizona has killed itself in any political ground
onemanga :U
with that law the conservatives really have killed themselves
onemanga w/e
2o.o
http://www.onemanga.com/Pokemon_Special/1/00/
I think it's gonna be overturned
though the liberals do nothing much
does it show the pokedex talking to ash? ;p
the FRSO has been fighting it, has as the USUP
i loved how it made fun of him in the first few episodes
Utah revoked
Minnasota, revoked
O.o
And wasn't as cool
There's dozens of other organizations threatening to pull funding and cancel vacations here
the laws support is going down thankfully
they took out the AI, as it'd probably turn into skynet
/me hides
(late) i dun never heard of Chronicals
with all the lapdogs each could have
hanity, oriely, Glenn Beck, etc
Then you FAIL
:U

maybe, it'll be "Our" moment
or maybe just something we could use
does anyone want to see my drawing?

kk, uploading soon
it really proves both canidates for presidency were not suitable, such as the rest of our presidents
lol Tracey Sketchit.... name fail
2XD
Yeah I know, it's sarcasm
XD
ogod.. tracey
he was just filler
nothing more
I still remember his Marill of doom
exactly @ Pre
and his Scyther
i liked his old scyther
yeah
that's about it
it had a back story
He wasn't even a filler
He was like...a filler character's long lost child
he was there to be stupid and fail
XD
he was in one of the movies, sitting in the backround doing nothing if i remember right
ya that's it
At the VERY END of the credits
lol
trying to get in the movie it seems

Online?
I've been just, but vengeful.
Whenever a posse is ganging up on a player, I ride in and wipe them out.
Whenever someone tries to take me out for no reason, I kill them repeatedly till they surrender or literally beg me to stop.
This past weekend, it was me and my friend against the world...
12o-o
/me surrenders to Kipikipo
A posse of 4 people attacked us on a plain
We, of course, killed them multiple times
12what are we talking about?
Kipi
12oh
12i see
I sniped their facial region, and they'd call me names for being a sniper
Then I just switched to the rifle, but they said I was sniping again, even though sniper rifles don't shoot that fast...
The words that followed...
they filled me with happiness. ¦3

Hilariously... I just realized a torrent I'm downloading isn't pirated it's actually supposed to be torrented... The CBC has offically become epic in my opinion.

did you get a gmail message from SR last night
You're welcome
why?
Was it likemypost.com?
yes.
still weird how he sent that o_O
hey
Hello
Hey
Maybe he sent it out automatically to all his contacts or something
From SR
Hmm
An interesting turn of events
I guessed as much
O.o
I mean, it's not like there aren't already 39872359 other facebook-like sites out there
his add said "likemypost.com v2 is now live!"
oh maybe
bbl
I got an interview

Oh, nice

:O
I was waiting for this trailer
maybe not as epic as that Mass Effect 2 trailer though eh? :P
I dunno
Harry Potter has the potential to be quite epic
But at the same time
that ME2 trailer was /really/ epic
loll
well
We'll find out
If you start having urges to watch it 15 more times
dun... dun... DUNNN!!!
XD

but my other old account with the stupid name I did
And he didn't do anything
I just felt like deleting him because he sucks

...LOL
cartoon network is blocked for you?
haven't watched it in years
[censored].
her sister isn't though
Nor my brother
but yeah about that trailer...
Am I the only one with goosebumps?
Lol
no
lol
Haha
I don't think we even get that channel
Howabout Animal Planet?
:P
But the reason they blocked it was because of Adult Swim at night
I don't care enough to ask them to unblock it'
never seen that
xP
and I rarely ever watch it
lol?
wtf
:(
and weren't they gonna stop you from playing spyro or something too because of the "violence"
You lived a deprived childhood
Then about 5 years later I was watching it again
O.o
That would be creepy
i dont even know anyone that is remotely that strict
ha
:P
heh
apparenly when I was 3 I saw clouded leopards humping
gosh
I don't think I was ever banned from Spyro for it being too violent though
huh?
hah
I was banned from my ganecube a few times for that reason
more like grounded I guess
play outside
apparently
lol, forgot about that
What;s there to do out there though?
:P
That was my parents' answer for everything
half the time when i was a kid id hurt someone by playing outside
"GO PLAY OUTSIDE"
:P
haha
QuantomAlpha: XD
there were never any kids on my street when I was a little younger thus why I never played outside because I couldn't go anywhere without having to walk a distance
You were a bully then I take it?
same here
I only had one friend within walking distance
all the rest were from 30-45 minute drives away
until one of them got the cops called on them for throwing rocks at another and then we broke up
I wish I had a group of kids that did that
it wasnt all that speical
lol hamtaro
:P
lol
i kneed one of them in the crotch for some reason as well but that was rough housing
and for some reason i was nick named hojo out of nowhere
lol
I loved Hamtaro
ham ham
Too bad it got canceled :(
hamtaro reminds me of card captors and sailor moon for some reason
lol, sailor moon
I remember that one
yeah
i dont think ive ever sat through an entire episode as a kid
lol, censored cat evasion
i think it was before or after thundercats though
I never watched Sailor Moon
I just watched that trailer again
Not one episode

/me pounce snuggles
the server's already moved in fact. But the url is still pointing to the wrong server
...wtf
yet the url points at 95.215.225.1 atm
because you're not coming with the right url referer
there're four urls runninig on this IP atm - the only thing splitting them is the url
it's quite intended to deliver a different page to the people just asking for an IP
as those are usually the poorest of the poor hackers :P
that's the basic domain security ;)
O...K
usually that means you don't have an index.html o.o

well, here you don't just pay for the drink, but you also need to pay a pawn for the bottle/tin
07oh
07that
07we've had that for years lol
15 cents for a glass bottle and 25 cents for a plastic bottle or a tin
even if those bottles or tins are disposed afterwards?
yeah
Michigan is the highest in the country inf act
at 10 cents
everywhere else it's 5
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2fhg0Qil0
that's how the machines look like here
07o3o
07we don't have those here lol
glass beer bottles: between 8 to 15 cents. Plastic bottles 25 cents if they're disposable, 15 cents if they're re-usable

02but the choice of nursing also follows something i've been wanting to do for a while, and that it taking care of babies :o
02no, not really
because it's gonna be hard to be a nurse if you can't even give people shots because you hate needles
well, Nursing is a lot more than nusring infants
*nursing
back
02I need to conquer my fears eventually
it's more or less taking care of ill paitents

12Seriously...?

a Zippo lighter, yeah
strange shaped?
http://www.magazinusa.com/ResV/img/originals/zippo_windproof_lighter.jpg
12For a lighter, it's one of those American looking ones
that's how it looks like when it's open
wtf are you gonna do with a lighter anyway
12wb arti <late>
that's because it IS originally american :P
12It's handy for starting fires
12XD
heh
most people here just use them to light cigarettes -_-
we have like, matches for fires
or butane lighters that aren't the little flip open kind
12We've got lighters too, way easier to light things than matches sometimes
did you know lighters were invented before matches were ever thought about?
12and Pea # 921 made me laugh LOL
hey Stormy|Sleeping

Drama?
Wasn't me this time! D: I haven't been here for... a while.

12I think I know why he's doing this
12XD
Oh.
Or rejoin on my part as well, but I dunno.
12Because he's creepy
I've just been avoiding you, Andres.
I was around IRC longer.
12he said in a comment that he's jealous
I've just been absent the past day.
12about you an Xai
02hey Xai
12and*
12Yes I know XD
12oh
12But he doesn't eveen know me
I have been avoiding you too, seems like a good policy for avoiding conflict. :3
12I know
Yes.
Probably good, too.
I'll keep it going.
/me sighs
._.
at least he's very patriotic
/me shrugs.
-_-
that was ... weird
.-.

I just called her and she was like oh, didn't you get it?
I'm upside down
/me stabs Verizon

LOL
12ya
I don't use it either XD
12does he have a TST account?
12No thankfully
12okay
yet don't worry about him. Few of those patriotic guys have the guts to seriously cause any harm
12When he doesn't even know me
but well, he's not "old"
12and has never spoken to me
LOL
/me hides
that piece of american junk is 8 years younger than me
12He LOOKS old XD we think he's like pretending to be 20
born feb 29 1988
12I agree then lol
12Yeh I don't believe that after seeing his photo
12LOL
05no fn way
05that is a lie
12I'm looking at his photo right now
05no-one that bald is 22
12Let me show the picture again XD http://americanho-oh.deviantart.com/#/d2sou04
my father had lost most of his hair when he was about 19
05he looks like 38
12Even his face looks old
nah - no
12more like 40
12LOLZ
12or 46
12I can't remember
look at the forehead. It's perfectly flat. Not a single wrinkle in it
12My mum doesn't have wrinkles and she's over 50 :3
12lol
one of my work mates is 23 but he looks 40
I just looked at the picture with him smiling. Someone of around 30 has those if he's smiling. I know it because I have those, too
and I have quite a good talent in telling the age of people I see^^
12He's certainly not 22 XD
12He made up the age to try and talk to me XD
12ya XD
12LOL
12now that is creepy LOL
12:3
12I don't lie about my age thank goodness LOL
12I'm 17
12Andrew I take it you saw the Xai pic last time right?
12XD
which pic?
12LOL I'm not worried about that TimeShift
12The one he drew of Xai
oh ya
12Loooool
05well the very fact he is lying about his age makes me even more suspicious.
12ya
D:
no, that had nothing to do with anyone here
/me tacklehugs a Curly.
/me hugs back
05i mean why can't he just leave her alone - she has never ever even messaged him and he is asking questions like "I'm worried about you, you don't come on DA anymore"
12I kind of agree with that :/
because people are weird?
XD
12lol
12everyone is different
/me slaps Arti with a Schwertfisch
/me sits indifferently in the corner
12Yeh but you're my friend TimeShift, you speak to me. He's never once spoken to me
12Lol
:)
12sounds creepy when you think about it :/
/me huggles Proto in the corner of indifference
/me hugs
/me is glad that this place serves as a good retreat from drama :3
02D:
12Thats not the only creepy thing though, the fact that he also drew a pic of Xai getting beaten up by a washing machine and then said he was JEALOUS Ovo
if this person tells me to leave her alone, I go, yeah
12Yeh but "I'm worried about you"
12Why is he worried when he can see I'm active on TST?
maybe he didn't join TST?
2(Xai2): No, I'm not SUCH a kind of stalker^^
05thank you.
12but he didn't reply back
12Where he could see that my last answred questions were recent
12I'm actually SURPRISED he's not joined LOL XD
12LOL
maybe he tried but I deleted him already?^^
12Lol
12LOL
12Do you remember the name American Ho-oh?
12Ok, I havent seen him try to draw yet XD
12I'll brb

see, you use those out of nostalgy, I know and used them because there was nothing but it
bet you don't know any schellack LPs anymore - and if you see such a thing you have no idea why there're speeds like 15, 33, 45 or 72 on it, right?
Speed wise, I though the speeds were 16-<fraction>, 33-1/3, 35 and 78.
(I don't remember the speed of the slowest one perfectly, but I do know they were used for radio transcription.)
hi guys

busy with work i take it, TimeShift?
2omai
2â•œ
this weekend is/was our maintenance window for our datacenter systems. And we had to upgrade our storage system of one datacenter - therefore shutting down all servers running there
oh right
TimeShift: Oww... the clinets must have been unpleased, to say the least.
04morning
that's why we have maintenance weekends. One in every month. Some of them are shorter, others longer
04ty
Well... preventative maintenance is always a good idea.
npl
backup systems need to be updated to faster and more performant one's
04the roof
but a full restore of a datacenter would take around...well....a week
or two
depends on how critical the data is
Hi Stitch!
/me shoots Stitch
Hey Stitch
Gentlemen, take it to a duel >.>
as I said - we have about 32 of those newly in one of the datacenters
/me pokes Espeon
how many had been there already...dunno...all I know is we have around 5000 logical servers running in my region
Nono, I mean something like the S/360, S/370, S/370-XA, ESA/370, ESA/390, z/System; and the clones of those.

04uh
04you join them
04you get their services
no; like
04you do quests for rewards
how tedious are they
04that's basically it
04oh
04well
04it depends on the Guild
04but most are rather tedious, but some are pretty fun
Say..that Imperial cultish thing
04?
04oh that is ridiculously easy at the start
Oh
i thought it was hard if you wanted to join all the guilds XD
and its really suprising how advancements work
04in Morrowind, if you join some guilds and complete them you can't join other guilds
usually 1 or 2 people do it
XD
Bethseda wanted to change that :P
04a Prime example of this is the Fighters Guild
let me guess..
if you join fighters guild
then you can't join thieves guild?
04yup
04well
04if you haven't finished all the quests you still can
because the fighters guild fights :p
Sleeptime.
Good night.
So..what if you're leader you can't be bothered to do such things?
04but once you finish the last two quests you can no longer join the Theives guild
04I can't say why because it'll spoil the quests
XD
though theres a mod that mocks it XD
04lol
yeah killing all the guild heads and ranimus polis basically kills the mages guild
they can't do anything for ranimus is literally
04lol
04heh
while in DB for example
theres 3
i am the invisible man... i am the invisible man...
the argonican
*Argonian
and the cool speaker
04lol
the idiot o the whole entire guild
It is
though you can use some tricks to get around feeding
04lo
waiting; never do it
04LOL
just fast travel
3Hi
04hi
and the sun
hurt you
:D
just feed
04lol
and never wait, which this triggers probablly the script or action to begin the 'vampiring' process
which completely is lame
3Wat
Floof has arrived!
for I want to be a lich XD
04SKYLANDS
/me glomps
/me hugs
but yeah theres mod that can make you werewolfs and such
04how are you Sky?
04lol
10Fine, you?
04there are Werewolves in the Morrowind Expansion, Bloodmoon
Yeah

Okay
Hello
03y
I got my iPod working again
03EW IPODS
It just took a trip to the apple store to get the firmware repaired
And the os correctly installed
And because of the os, I kept having connection problems
weeeeeeeeeeee
LIES! IOS 80 has been patched. DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
I beg to differ
03orly
Hmm, brb, need to check IOS 249.
03all their products are inferior to others on the market anyway
They're fixing all their AT&T problems that have been there for 3 yard
Hehe, it's like a kitty :D
Years*
03Droid has never had Verizon problems
Their hardware is updated
Hey
A security guard kitty :3
grrrr >_>
03it's still inferior to other hardware
:>
oop, gonna get bit ar
/me cuffs Proto
Aristeo*
and yes I have them
pff
03I do.
That thought never crossed my mind
Except that they refuse to speed up iTunes for pc's.
Well, now it is
I'm trying hard to learn about mIRC scripting
but it hadn't before
it's crazy-complex
That I can complain about
Not really.
Think of one good reason to hate them
if you get into DLLs and filehandling it is
...
not to mention DDE handling
03There are lots of reasons.
Gimme one
Not anymore
03Two, even with "updated", other brands still make FAR technologically superior products
/me pokes the $150 8GB iPod Nano
038GB Sansa is like $50
and allow users to dcc download it, should they wish
Yeah, but does it do videos and radio
And Bluetooth
03Absolutely.
03wtf bluetooth
but that requires filehandling, DDE commands, and possibly tapping into Winamp's DLLs
I think it's a little above my reach
back
03but yes, Sansas have had radio since WAY before iPods have
back
03in fact APple kinda ripped that off them
02wb
03Sansas can even RECORD the radio
o.o
03as well as voice
03and it's like 1/3 of the pric
O_o
03e
12hi
are you playing OoT?
12no
03Theguesst, it's as good as any
and hai~
kay
03a third reason: APple is like the leaders in CLOSED source, if you want OSX you have to buy their crappy hardware too
12i'm having difficulty
Good as any?
did you get the bottles?
oh?
12i got a bottle
do tell :3
03Theguesst, yes, meaning the audio quality is just as good as iPods
12lol
good
03in fact for the sound-noise ratio, iPods aren'te ven that good
12phantom ganonfork
did you put a Fairy in it?
12no
you're an adult already?
12yes
ok
Like you do a lot o cycling like me
03what do you mean physical activity
And want to listen to music
ty
03Plus
03Sansas have MicroSD card slots
03iPods have NEVER had that
12i CAN
12can't beat him
03with a simple card
oh
03and that's just one particular mp3 player, there's lots of them LOL
how many hearts do you have?
126
Not just .mp3
/me hmms
12i found like a billion heart pieces
12but i can't get them
03more than iPods have...
LOL
03it'll do mp3, m4a, OGG, etc
Meep
ok
03yeah
03it does those
03well wtf .aac
03it'll do m4a
03which is the same thing
03it'll do WAV
03and mp3, and mp4, and w/e
12right now i'm messing with TP
how many do you have on you?
I left my iPhone connected to IRC overnight
/me hmms
How easy is it for an idiot to use?
Like say, my whole family
I haven't played TP in a time lol
but anyway
in OoT...
/me thinks
I did that omce
03LOL @ idiots
03I think it's just as easy to use as iPods
did you get the 2 in the graveyard as an adult?
03plus you can actually put Rockbox on them :D
12no
03you used to be able to on iPods, but not in the past ... like 5 years you can't
03but you still can on Sandisk players
12i got one
12but i don't remember how i got it XD
12no
Ok, not too bad
re-race Dampe
Glac, I could help after I convince drf apple isn't that bad
get under 1 minute for a piece
Bbl going to play Angry Birds on my iPhone
then go to the windmill for the other
Aka*
03LOL
*up to the windmill
Let's move on to the phone
03compared to other products
03EW IPHONES
12i'd much rather figure out fishing right now
Why do you hate the iPhone?
Reason
kay
I need one
03First of all, no actual keyboard
2o.o
I can deal with that
03secondly, WTF only one button?
2lol
I'm using no keyboard right now
It's not all bad
03eh
03I've heard f people having their iPhones freeze and they literally have to wait til the battery runs out for it to restart
I would make the same mistakes on a real keyboard
03that's the other thing
03you can actually remove the battery of the DRoid
You won't need to replace it
/me reads
03batteries can die dude
03plus if it FREEZES
03you can just pop it out
03iPhones you have to like, hold buttons for a while, realize you're screwed, and sit and wait
03that might also fix the freezing
Just like a droid
03orly?
03ever heard of FAULTY SOFTWARE?
Harpy
02ALTAIR
03if the only thing you EVER use is the browser, maybe
/me snugs
Ya rly
03and those are known to freeze
NS!
/me snugs back
<_<brb turning autocorrect off
03see, my Droid doesn't need autocorrect, it has a keyboard
/me hides
Well some of us aren't that literate
02;3
03wtf?
02http://i627.photobucket.com/albums/tt357/palmo6/pkm.png
02Altair
:o
Or are and are just hindered by this
03That's kinda sad
02put that up for an affiliate plz
/me lazy
url?
I was jk ing
02um
You're sad D:<
02http://s1.zetaboards.com/PokemonDistrict/site/
that needs to stop changing
02I know
02>>
03o.o
03whatever
03moving along, APple's computers
i'm not going to change it again
02oh wait
03maybe Alt can de it
02nvm
03do
02XD
03with even faster processors and whatnot
02And SpooKy should seriously
also :3@Snea
Hating a company for mistakes easily comparable to r corporations
Other*
02just use one url
02and reupload it
03You can get even like a $500 crap laptop with a faster processor than that
Well don't buy the f in thing
03I don't
The Mac mini
03what about it
If you want a Mac, you get it for osX
Not for the hardware
03that's beside the point
03but you can't, which yet another reason I hate them :P
03that and OSX is stupidly annoying, I see nothing you can do in it that other OSes can't do
Well that's why they sell the freaking Mac
03*Brains
03so?
03WIndows is like $300 'full'
03I get it for free thanks to my school though
03not pirated, either
The built quality is unmatched
03what>?
It'll last 10 years
At least
03orly
03my university has some Macs that are like 3-4 years old and are already sluggish and slow
those poor Macs
Ya rly
Well they've never heard of clearing their history
Another thing
Marketing
03every time someone restarts the computer it erases any changes made
03what history are you referring to?
/me doesn't :3
03as I actually know how to use a computer
03I know
I do too
03but it ERASES THAT
03when you log off
Not really
lol
03yes it does
03you've never heard of a bootup image before?
I have
I think we got lost somewhere
03brb, regardless.
Screw it
$19
a fork whuh?
Fork + Coke bottle + dry ice
:P
Assault :o
it has decent Multi IMO
<random>
My friends used to play multi all the time
I logged it
Loved*
I did it to a junk school computer >.>
And yes, the campaign is Meg
Meh*
Totally unplugged that thing in about three seconds
And autocorrect is >_>
lol
the only reason to go 1p is for the extra characters no?
Yep

she asked for it
and only like 5-4 people did that
Yeah. You shouldn't really have to ask for it though :/
thats her deal
12sure
actually here's my Communist bet
a majority of DA mostly exist
to be Worshipers of several people
like take for example..
I mean, I would actually like to know WHAT'S nice about it
that one girl
that happens to many
In which I do say
DA is pathetic
the versions and changes?
and they get blinded and don't improve, and then they become stuck up bitches :3
I have a lot of people I look up to, but I don't worship them
I really facepalm at fanclubs for artists on dA
like really
Ha
hahahaha
/me doesn't go around kissing awesome artist's feet for nothing
^
and they say we created personality cults
DA is a site for that crap
>:3
04Espeon
/me chews on the next person
I mean I had a period where I tried to be constructive
04if you facepalm at fanclubs for artists
over 50% of the comments got hidden
Not Zu Zu
why?
04would you facepalm at Fanclubs for a persons OC?
and/or their fanboys/-girls called me a "meanie"
/me noms his own tail.
yes I would
:3
YES

I knew you were gonna type somethin'
and may I say one terrible thing?
04there is a fanclub of her character, Zonoya, and another for two of her characters
04and yes
04go
I understand that you like a certain person's OC
lol facepalm
Hyahahaha

sadafgfsa
04Shiny
Espeon; she has done prono
04she's made a fanstamp of her comic
04which I find ok
in which she has her OC
and a character that has no sexual desire
04lol
Do a 'yiff'

I'm talking about someone else
04oh
/me headbashes

04lol
http://kairiko.deviantart.com/
12:P

I decided to go do something, specifically to defy you
12LOL POKIPIKI
12aren't names fun

And there's a couple stamps of her characters from it
04._.

Why don't you add me?

/me dies
I can barely draw
I've done nothing wrong!
but I dont
Brother
and that isn't done by saying "so kawaii"
add you where?
Never
04Espeon, I understand that, and if people want to help me, then I'll let them give me advice
Lucario: but hey
That's why I didn't run back here crying because Brother gave me critique
at least you can fly now :O
Espeon
12well i gotta go now bye

12You could before, it was called noclip.
loath
Kawaii
04looool
04what does that even mean?
nm that was an hour ago
I loath japanese phrases used by anime fangirls/-boys
I think it means cute
kawaii?
but it's like the master race of "cute"
It's Wapanese for chibi/cute
cuddly
04oh

I know
OVER 9000
But then again
04that works
besides
/me steals Nick
and call them "canon" even
would let someone
RAPE THEM
/me stores him in a jar
04Espeon wat
/me puts the hurt on kipi for nick thieving
04Zonoya sorta wanted that
/me sells jarred Nicks on the streets.
thats called
stupidity
its also called
the only thing beating it is probably yaoi couples *shivers*
04Cynder just tries to tell her "He molested joo!"
a thing to get rid of in a GULAG
04._.
lol
/me shudders at the word 'yaoi'
/me had already put the hurt on kipi
I need to tell you all now

thats how fapping was born sadly
their
'their'
04I have no idea
its twilight
or Yaoi
04lol
You guys are all highlighting me with "Yaoi", "Yuri", and "Hentai" D:
LOL
XD
Burn the witch!
04LOL
what's the point using like 10 different "don't steal my art" stamps..!?
It's a true-believer!
you thought there was a point?
I mean, non-believer!
Yeah...that!
dont you see; for her
there is no point
the point is to praise our savior
Spyro
lol
he rose from the gamer grave and became our savior
No...don't give Spyro a bad name
He's awesome in Playstation games
classicla spyro; I hope you arent used in that name
/me hides
When he was owned by Insomniac
Espeon no
no no no
ita worse
wtf? Camera offline?
Beyblade
lol wut
Has
/me shudders
recolour 101
he did a voice in for spyro
the 90s was cursed
Yet we all loved it
CSI Arti - check it out^^
we all hated it
it had no sense
12XP restarted due to updates -v-
12I'ts back
not Sat AM
the other one
04:\
That's because it took half our lives to make the shows slowly weaken into stupidity
its a good thing I was born in 95 then :D
04er, that real-time one?
yes
Yes, that would be the movie
04I haven't seen it
the girl that made the spyro comic
I second that
which has porn in it
04uh
I actually saw the behind the scenes, and this was their inspiration for making the movie:
a little girl
04Shalone doesn't have porn IN the comic
thats because she never posts it
but she made a little comic of the molest of zonoya
04ovo
lol
04hurr
I misread zonoya as zorua EVERY time /random
..-.
04Hey, Director-man
04maybe try making an animated one next time
my response to director;
The style was completely off in the movie
try putting asians in next time~
Too much earthbending in waterbending
and basically they have to have the element
to bend it
Why asians? Avatar isn't even an anime o.o
Why?
Because the creators actually based it off of Asian culture and anime
But its suppose to be Asian oriented
Good thing it's quiet
based off the cultures of Asian
Otherwise I'd be too distracted to make illegal drugs.
I mean, Momo is Japanese for peach, which Momo was eating when Aang named him
The bending styles are all based off of kung fu styles
Also
shes a narutard
04lol
a furry one to >>
Air Nomads have the same beliefs as Buddhism
*cough*pascifistidiots*cough
lol, narutards
also
she makes all these pictures for him when dragons just apperently flop over for him
heck alot of people do that o.o
There was calligraphy in the show
04lol
04so it makes it even scarier
fot I have no clue
I'mm too..intelligent and resistent to drama
04you know Eragon? The Movie or the Book?
04Thorn is one of the dragons in it.
LOL
i can make a dirty joke about that
but I resist it
04LOL
but its not just her
others do it
like 'sexycynder'
/me runs
04waitwhat
04who is this?
04wait I think I know
lol wut
dannish person

04at least CASF is innocent
and the..
ym
dude
thing
CASF?
but hardly
cynder-and-spyro-fan or something.
her 'boyfriend' makes dirty pictures

i dont even think I'm worth to be a teenager DD:
04waitwhat
04CASF has a boyfriend?
04and Espeon I'm pretty sure
SexyCynder does
whose CASF?
04ooooooh
04CASF = cynder-and-spyro-fan
lol
04[22:06] <Soyuz> her 'boyfriend' makes dirty pictures
04dragons don't have breasts
04they are reptiles
tell that to him
04[/science]
04http://cynder-and-spyro-fan.deviantart.com/
but in any case
I dislike "it's female, it must have breasts"
04^
I dislike "It's female, it must have gigantic breasts"
and dont you dare say a dirty word
Espeon:
we think the same
only reality is against us
04>.>
04<.<
04lol
04well me
04meh*
04bah

and sunndely died
that sorta creeps me out
Furries

npw I remember her
04only hers is much higher quality + takes longer for the next one to come out
plus
04tbh I prefer cell-shading

they wear clothing too
04...
04HOLY SHI
04wtf
04that is scary
clothing is necessarily as bad, seeing as at least the one I saw was standing upright, it looked okay
in which thats her preview porn
04but....LIPSTICK?
inorite
:
yes lipstick

I dont want to imagine spyro being frodo
aska
*aka
Frodo from LOTR
04I actually like how Elijah voices him
04Cynder's voice actors from ANB and DotD were pretty good as well
04TEN...meh
I don't play games much
04anyway

/me squints
but everything u hack is addicted to hbc
06:29 X3 She thinks we look good.
4no tou sentance said "HE"
See?
whats is hbc/
?
I just copied and pasted it right there
hbc is a hacked channel wich reads ur sd
oh ok
o.O
and then u can install hacks from the sd
and everything else
but u can update to 4.2 if it isnt possible to hack 4.1
and then u can hack 4.2
4.1 is hackable.
Just make sure you install the correct IOS before you "Downgrade"
:P
u have to downgrade the correct ios to downgrade the wii
Or you'll brick.
/me listen 'Love the Way you Lie' 'Eminem'
xD
just install the system menu
again
with a hack
Which menu?
the system menu u have
thnx guys
on ur 1/2 bricked wi

np
search for a tut on gbatemp.net

there are two guides.. one for 3.1-4.1 and one for 4.2
None for 4.3?
no
you can't softmod a 4.3 unless it was softmodded before updating to 4.3
Now that is too many ?'s.
u have to downgrade 4.3 to 4.1
gamefunne, that ONLY works if it was softmodded before you upgraded to 4.3
? downgrade
really?
You could always use korean IOS.

you need to have a cios installed to downgrade 4.3

Oh, by the way
/me 4talks to imanimate items

Okay then, you should be all set
is the wii region free?
load boot.dol/.elf?

Yes.

4hello?
were you asking for a stock wii?
not hacked?
cause thats a diffrent story
yes
stock
^
if you're in the states, get an ntsc wii
isnt hacked wii region free...?
no
ooooh
:)
install it as IOS, if you want
ok all done i think
if you're in a pal region, then get a pal wii
Chimerah
do i have to do something els
in my house we have both 110/220, it is the standard here to provide the 2

or very cheap enclosure and 750GB WD internal HDD :)

anyone want to be in my picture?
yep yep
i think the difference in price is not that much between the 500 and 750
hai
keep in mind that not all enclosures are compatible with the wii
i can only have about 4 or 5 buddies in my picture
even 500gb is overkill

/me now belongs to Darkhunter101 for 13 minutes
i recall you can use 2 partitions, one for the wii and the other just storage
200-250 is PLENTY
=D
HEEELLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?
/me hugs Espeon
you can use an many partitions as you want
but for the wii its fat,fat32,ntfs,wbfs
fat32 > * when it comes to wii
most go with a ntfs and fat32
>.>
fat32 all the way
? softmod
fat32 fir the homebrew
there's no need for ntfs
o.o
.-.
size limitation
is anyone ther hello
there is no need for ntfs
i like to archive on my drive too wulf
i think fat32 does not support files larger than 4 GB
I'm talking strictly wii
i put my HD movies on there aswell
I'm here
wanna be in my pic Bunnyfitten and timeshift
the best thing about fat32 is that it is well documented
if you're going to partition a drive, then use fat32 for wii and whatever for the rest
well, why not?
compared to ntfs for instance
7sure
03à¹Í¡Ì¯à¹ï´¿
ok ^Wulfgar^
same for you Bunnyfitten
eh? something else but that?
ahh works thanks a lot
7hmmmm....
programs auto split 4gig files
but if you plan to stream movies and they are larger then 4gigs then go NTFS
7Electrike?
if its just for wii games Fat32
instead of streaming
:)
Wii can't handle streaming movies that are > 1gig
wifi too slow
you decided timeshift
dunno in fact^^
I stream 1.5gb movies just fine
chose a random one
/me 7changes her mind "Buneary seems more fitting for me."
timeshift be an electrike!
as I said, wii isn't HD anyhow...so why you'd wanna play a HD movie on it is beyond me
please?
meh
is that a yes timeshift
even non HD DVD's stream for crap...
it's a meh, not more and not less
if converted to XVID work fine
Floof has arrived!
if you want HD, get a wd-hdtv

Isn't there a sort of "flag" that allows me to delete the Forecast Channel via the Data Management screen?
not quite
you want it like this sd:\apps\nes\

not quite sure lol
create a folder on sd called apps
ok done
in there create a folder called nes
in there extract the files from the emulator
whats the best emulator
you can either burn them to dvd or load them of the network

03is Xai actually defending such idiocy?

05I genuinely like it. DRF is jelous
03Nah
03we had that problem a couple years ago and it kinda sorted itself out
lol drf is jelous drf is jelous
05in fact he is more jelous of my U's as in 'colour, jelous etc'
05because he can't speak english
lol
03because he's an idiot?
05go chew som alooominum, DRF
05LOL
03Just saying
/me hits drf
03neither does not using apostrophies
033 strikes, you're out
12XD
yea
05n'either doe's n't using ap'strophies
05cool
12No TimeShift does too
05watching it now
12And you get all mad at him
05bye
03that's because TimeShift just takes every opportunity to argue with me
it's not my fault if you're a target like an open barn's gate
03XD
03well I just get annoyed at n00bs being on here -_-
:(...
12WTF
12I just got a PM from zu-zu asking me why I called myself gay!?
12Who's been typing on my computer?
not me
well you did say it arti
12No, someone was using my keyboard
oh
12But what's annoying me actually is that you said it's sick and you won't be talking to me again
12That's homophobic and discriminative
03I never understood how the term homophobic was used to mean *hating* gays
sorry arti that was me XF
03when phobias are *fears*
XD
well its because you said it i didn't like it it upset me
12LOL
03then Xai would be mad?
/me hides
you ARE gay
03LOL
03o.o are there?
12Yes???
03I generally don't ask XD
12Lol no one needs to ask
/me growls at Espeon
http://xelig00n.deviantart.com/art/Awesome-Floof-170044201
:3
04Espeon
04its happened again
12I never said you were
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
? list
mod "Espeon" on there
:(.....
lol
04i don't feel well x-x
:<
/me pats
04eep
04horrible stomach ache
04i think i might just kill the server
/me sits all alone
xD
04does 20 sound good?
there's nothing like a "normal" pattern. It's just an "average" we like to use as "normal". But this doesn't make everthing standing outside of this "average" state equal to be "bad", "wrong" or sick
30 should work.
12Right the photos are resized, time to sort through each one
03it's not that I don't want you here, you just act like a little kid
12She is LOL
03exactly
12Not that it's a bad thing
12Just that it's not really tolerated in places like this
:(
03I've always thought people start using IRC at WAY too young of ages LOL
03I mean, if you act mature that's fine
03but eh
03TimeShift, LOL, sometimes sure but not ALL the time
03yes
04i don't think 30 is severe enough
hmp
04sigh
04i wish Nightshadow could be here XD
04this is the reason i was afraid of making the server public
bonsoir
04sure strangers are joining now but i haven't seen any of them really join because they have an interest
lol
here have a nice glass of lemonade drf
and me aswell
lol

Update on it
Then use the rescue menu to install 4.3
XD
I slept most of the day
which means we'll be getting scrawny spider-kid :\
Bieber, quit being a dumbass
sundays always seem to be boring :<
looks lite this channel topic says 4.3 is out ? any idea which games use 4.3 ?
:p sorry
Flames!
None have it on disc yet, I'm afraid.
ultimate spider ma was at least semi good in my view
raaaaaandy said you stole 'baby baby' from him Bieber
I didnt like the ultimate series, I liked the sort of 90s cartoon where he was actually a man, and seemed like buff and strong, not that skinny style
i guess only softmodded, only neo... was on the menu screen
Ahh
I dunno :o
meh the 90s cartoons animation was...well not tha good
I think she is alive.
it was good in plot
I still have hosting from her!
but the animation coud have least been worked on
and hbc was also installed
in the 3rd spiderman movie he turns emo
Well, you're gonna have to wait for a disc with 4.3K
Sorry.
they should have shown more Venom in that movie
everyone got screentime but him XD
I thought the animation from the 90s was pretty good they did seem to put detail into the character models
/me throws a letter at Andres.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/08/raaaaaaaandy-gets-ripped_n_489971.html
I dont mean like character detail

But since I have to work lots, that plan is cancelled ._.
I actually had a terrible encounter with a sparrow
it pooped on me while chasing a female around

I need to VNC :/
I apparently don't have permissions to load exes on this computer other than the installed programs' exes
04hurr
>>
04thus why I don't use my school laptop
And I actually really need it
Stitch
Do you think I WANT to use this piece of <censored>?
04no, I'm just saying

a lot more than it should
04oh wonderful
04we have Macs
Proto
uh
lopl
XD
I gave up hours ago
7 is pretty
Pupitar
but it <censored> fails
400MHz and 240MB RAM 8D
http://pokemon.marriland.com/hgss/pokedex/pupitar/
04Vista is annoying to use, but the rest of the Laptop makes up for it
I don't like Vista and 7
They're harder to use
I can barely find the retarded Local Disk (C:) and My Computer on this

04:|
And where is the 'Run' thing
that XP has
that was actually good
I'd just go run -> cmd
or run -> MSpaint or run -> calc
yes I'm that lazy
I can't even be bothered to scroll up the start menu to find those programs
Can't install mIRC or anything for that matter on this fail of a computer
why it's even called a computer astounds me
also
04?
ciao
I lost all my scripts and such ;;
I really really need to VNC
uh
04D:

Do you know how to install programs if you don't have the permissions?
04Nightshadow
04You are really, REALLY good at ranting
I've had a look at the registry but I don't have access to the things I need to
I know
I was ranting about BSoDs earlier
haven't finished it yet
04lol
I'll pastebin it for you later if you want
when I finish XD
04and I am really annoyed atm

Yeah
Download the server
install it
it's already on there
then go to config

It seems that I've "fixed" the Photo Channel

And then just config it from there
It keeps connecting to flame.ho-ohrealm.net
it's fairly simple really
strange
o_O
I have both in the list
shadow.ambernova.net port 6697?
but it seems to prefer this one even if I reorder the list
o_O
might be closer
flame.ho-ohrealm.net 6697, shadow.ambernova.net 6697
04waitwaitwait
not off the top of my head anyway
04NS, that means we use that URL in the advanced connection part of PO?
o.o
uh, why?
04ok
if the public part isn't working
oh
04just making it clear
Ragnarok
just /server shadow.ambernova.net:6668
6668 works
I never used the server list
I need SSL tested
ohwait
yeah
oh that works
I was going to correct myself
thanks TerrorBite

http://www.sendspace.com/file/3xxibi
http://wiibrew.org/IOS
how do you run GC backups on the wii?
i use backup luncher for GC
dvd-rs?
you have to use GC controller
yeah
dvd-r, gc controller and a gc memory card
dvd-r and you can use multigames in one dvd
the launcher is installed directly into mios
oh ok
you can put 3to5 games on a dvd
That's it?
whats wode?
i'm not doing that, i'll probably waste more discs trying to get all the games to work
http://google.com
cmios has nothing to do with cioscorps

yes

? list
plugging it in to the wrong port? :þ
? softmod
lol ReD^DoG no
i have the \wbfs\ folder (as to installed by wbfs manager)
|doogie| http://hackmywii.net/custom-iosx-rev19-installer-released

thanks
hence why i had the link handy lol
and why ntfs?
fat32 > * for wii
it'll get sorted soon enough though, i have full faith in me and advice from ppl :)
I hope you didn't dedicate the whole 2tb to wii
yup
712 games installed
then I'd definately go with fat32
I assume you converted .iso to .wbfs
i've loaded it up now.. took nearly 28 hours...
yes of course :)
transfered with wii backup manager?
yup
...
you're doing everything to make him look like an idiot.
just checking...geezus
i guess that's a way of troubleshooting
yup all in
i am gonna doouble check i have cios19
using a forwarder for cfgloader?
yes
brb fone

Hullooo
can you guys recommend a place to order wii wode?
from mastag22
i got mine from www.ps2tune.com
thnx
www.gamefreax.com also has wodes
mastag22 sells wodes
?
ps3 wode would be nice ;)
:)
/me runs around in circles!
WHY would you want a wode?
for GC isos...
thats the only reason
i'll never spend as much money on discs as i would on a wode (or a hdd)
o
honestly, the main problem is that my system dvd seems d3-2
just isos
the honly solution could be replacing the dvd itself
here you can see my wii/wode setup: http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6511/cimg0001.jpg
wow, nice
:)
this spyro isn't running on wii, is it?
yea its spyro a heroes tail GC version
works smoothly with wode
hm
looks like spyro 1 first world.
ccpro
i have one
:/
but priceless for mh3
mh3?
yes
cproc? o_O
^Wulfgar^: not here
but they are not available
it is much easier to keep them all in iso format
did everyone forget dvdrs still exist? :/
or gx
w/e it is
modded cube...lol...just burn 'em...geez
u realize dvdr's are still the cheapest way to backup up data if u look at cost per gig
did not update the FW, still 1st release
IV20: i do >:/
unlike everyone else
i bought a used wii
cheaper than a wode
ok
6meow
lol
but still the idea of reading isos is not bad
lottery*
which i won :3
GeneraLee, you realize that there IS a gc iso loader in the works, right?

do you think it there would be a problem if I re-install it?
would there be a problem?
(reinstall the whole hackmii)
xtrato: you wouldn't be loading the hbc then pressing hackmii_installer would you?...
doubtful
no no
would it help? doubtful
xtrato: try taking a picture and uploading it somewhere
mmm maybe installing a previous version of the homebrew channel

/me huggles!
Mplayer ce plays iso?
/me hugs
doubt it - it might do, though
presumably that's an ISO of a DVD
yeah
/me pounces Stitch
/me huggles
well, there's only one way to find out
try it and see
flowers make the best gift to a loved one apparently even if they do die eventually and wilt and start to stink and rot
*nods*
Does Mplayer need any cIOS?
not afaik
but please read the !rules, you're a bit tentative...
for USB2.0 I think it might, not sure though
go with chocolate
chocolate yum
Oh I forgot, mplayer isn't allowed here >>
um
no
mplayer is fine
lol yeah i DID
cIOS isn't allowed here sometimes, depending on its use
lol
it's cIOS that's the issue
we try to avoid it in most cases
but for MPlayer on 202, you're fine
smae problem
I blame Vista
Isn't HBC in the first place breaking the rules anyway? why worry about piracy if you already broke rules?
lol
um
there's no flavor
Dosnt it go against some TOS or something like that?
anyone know how to get and put boxart for the games on usbloader w/o having to download them manually through the usbloader?
It's not legit, but it's also not illegal (in most countries)
Hiya!
hbc is too legit
hi Obsi
yes
/me hugs Obsi & May
wb Kipi
lol
Hullo, Oreo.
:O Oreo
TBH, I'm not sure whether it's legal in the US or not, DMCA and all that
/me hugs Kipi
Oreo?
lol
Oreoslash
isn't there something against reverse-engineering or something?
pretty sure it is legal in US
yes
TOS is pretty much a warrenty
in order to break piracy, yes
glad I don't live there then, lol :P
but i don't think hbc has that intention :)
/me gives you a basket full
smugleaf <3
/me snuggles May
mAY
*May
ya
I didn't realize i was eating biscuits until I was told
that's kind of odd

that's really weird
I didn't think that was possible to imitate chocolate chips

No
in a way money is food. but only in a way
I'm an herbivore, and money is the root of all evil.
Espeon: depends on the situation but dont make me use my brain
Therefore, money, as roots, is edible as a plant to herbivors
Espeon: if only for a day
Brother, that's dumb.
I eat the roots.
no Espeon he eats evil
therefore he is
Yush.

Yeah.
It really is becoming great.
And I prefer apt-get myself.
I just use aptitude
/me was hoping to tackle a hug onto it >:/
(Used to prefer apt-get)
Then again, it's going to start selling software soon
that's nothin
really?
i've been playing pkmn glod on my 2004 pda for awhile
;p
Mhm, I think that's a good thing though.
gold*
i sometimes use apt-get
hiiiiiii
If people want to sell their software, they should be able to.
I use aptitude (commandline only, no gui, not even curses)/yum
/me sighs
And providing them the means to do it is good.
aptitude is curses :P
03XD
yeah :P
03Now to find a GBA emulator that is free
|Omega|: well yeah, LinDVD :P
there are plenty
but it annoys me because it's just raw packages

How is the Miyuki? :o
you can't sell something that is similar to something copyrighted
legally
03It says Purchase $4.99
03o.o
why not just grab a cracked version of one of those
for free
tpw_rules: aptitude search blah

13PONYO!

http://i50.tinypic.com/30c90zc.jpg I am proud
I've seen a lot of this year's movies and the best ones were HTTYD and Toy Story 3
12Oh lol
i havent seen toy story
I very nearly teared up a bit
i dont watch too many movies anymore
/me shrugs t
13oh hey Arti
i only watched httyd cause the night fury intrigued me
meh
We all <3 you Sky, that's why :3
good luck Kyro :3
wish SMF had a function like the FAF do. Admins and Mods can give users warning points there. If a user has too many of them, all his postings require moderation - saying a Mod needs to read over the comments BEFORE they're either activated or deleted
the night fury was awesome
lol warn system
10:P
6*caused
13who?
yeah, it was pretty good
Espeon: that reminds me of the reputation system
yet still I'm a feature-lover :)
but there were several others that i wanted to see but never really got up to see them
Aww
speaking of which... another movie rental place is going out of business here in town
13and now our feature presentation
and, like most here, a bit random :P
Yeah, InspIRCd has some problems
Maybe you could give it a hug and then it would work!
oh really?
lol rep system
i'm supprised cause it was the only competition to block buster
13X3
10:3
I believe SMF does have something like that. It's called "Karma"-system
hi guys
i have CFG
arg...this reminds me of revleft now >>
I've seen that on quite a few sites. Silly name for it though
12*yawn*

13OO
12Curious
13Hi Lucario
14Der be a Lucario
i doubt it but i still dont go there
does my drive HAVE to be WBFS for GX loader to see it?
/me builds a very dangerous fountain out of sausages, while running naked in the woods while trying to claw at the moon.
use cfg
/me tugs Skylandstail :3c
even if they did they wouldn't charge you extra for later rentals I'm sure
/me then poofs
6fine
and u can use fat32 or ntfs
13X3
i prefer fat32 as do most
i sorta wanted to try out netflix or gametap sometime though
o.o

I've had both
"The best battle is the battle that doesn't need to be fought" - that's a chinese saying
I say, we plant bait
i dont even think i have cIOS 222

xD
It's all online
the senseless for the supernatural.
the kiosks are connected to the internets

sorry
:P
6...

Hello
And welcome to Walmart!
i'm feeling like arbies
kthx
ha
Hm
Well
Other than being annoyed at Walmart management for making me repeat tasks and then undo them
The roof was leaking today
:O
At Walmart?
Silly modem-
yeah
and they couldn't do anything about it because construction has the day off
:P
Oh
air conditinoing unit and pipes tend to leak around here but they dont do a thing to them
Our Walmart has a leaky roof and all we do is the buckets as well
I know where all the leaky spots are too because it was my job to put the buckets there
ours had a bat recently
brb, time to eat
XD
Oh yeah
it was fun
*on
Nah, we just watched
:P
but i didnt get to do much as i worked
Haha
anyway
it had the scent of a used diaper
o.O
i found a used diaper last night in my aile
oh, you had to work?
yep
:(
only positive to that is that i get paid for the holiday
he work now?
yeah, he works at Culvers
never heard of it
it's a fast food place
he takes orders and cleans tables
w/o blowing shit up?
yeah
course you already kno
and potentially two other jobs
o.o
Lamba quit from walmart already?
lol
Lambda*
yeap
i still dont
everyone has the full hostmasks now
/me shot the moon.
awesome
Yawn, easy.
now you got to skinn it debone it butcher it and cook it
I was refering to hearts by the way. :P
lol
i know
actually first thing i thought of was a yoyo trick
Ok, didn't know if you knew. XD
haha
if GX loader asks me to format a WBFS partition...
and i click format
or just an unused part?
man i wish you guys knew how to play eucher
all of it
usally
hmm
is there anyway of getting GX loader to use FAT32
instead of WBFS?
no not that i know
of
gx is tarted
go dl/ cfg :)
i have CFG
alread
already*
lmao
because i like the GUI
hah reskin cfg
hmm
they have 3989083890 themes
to quiet
i dont like CFG's font.
its like 16 bit.
it there anyway to partition my harddrive without completely formatting it?
lol my brother is cussing people out in wow and i can hear him in the other room
Lol, I dunno any of those. The ones I play are usually one of: Slam, shit head, poker (texas hold 'em), hearts, or trumps.
/me yips.
/me yaps!
/me YOWLS!!!
trumps?
yes
how?
wtf is shit head lol
wbfs manager?
or something like that?
Just card games. XD
trumps makes me think eucher
wbfs manger
its called Wii Backup Manager?
no thats wii backup manger
thou i think that does it 2
hmm
okay
ill look into them
thanks alot
see |Shadow| that wasnt too hard.
xD
ha
i think he hates me
he hates n00bs
he hates u
but its not personall
its just he doesnt like u :) haha
Oh, and you can play in teams if you want.
back
Some numbers do certain things.
Well, each person starts with 7 cards, and three face down cards, with three face up cards on top of them.
haha
Oh, I like go fish.
eucher is fun though
hehe
me 2
dont feel bad
You have to play a card the same as, or higher than the previous card (unless circumstances brought about by special cards change it).
some people have more time to devote to it then others
Oh, I forgot cheat as well.
haha
and not at all
Lol
a developer
Not really
:P
its not due to time its due to users knowing how to use a search engine
not at all
i was storta getting that vib a little
Her parents are but she is not
her parents are nazis!
baq
lol
[17:56] <&Stormy> yeah, he works at Culvers
[17:56] <+Infamouz> never heard of it
:O
Never heard of Culver's!?
Nor have I, but I live in the UK.
I think it's a midwest chain
lol, I'm not surprised that you haven't, for tht very reason
oh, it might be
most of them are in Minnesota and Wisconsin
I always assumed it was nationwide
but I never had any reason why I assumed that
I remember reading the paper that they put on the trays
http://www.termlifeinsurance.org/15-things-you-should-know-about-weed/
And it listed all their locations
there actually weren't very many
Hm
XD, I just noticed something
There we go
okay
how do i partition without formatting the drive?
\o/
i like me a mocha
Never had Mocha
I'm willing to try it sometime though
whats the difference between a mocha anda capachino
its good
tastes more like chocolate than coffee
the drive is already FAT32
but backing it up
would take hours.
I haven't had cappucino either :P
why do you have to back it up?
i personally hate coffee
i want to partition it as wbfsÃ©fat32
whoops
if it's already fat32, just convert .iso to .wbfs
wbfs/fat32
Hot drinks seem weird to me
but i drink it to get me in a decent mood
you don't need wbfs
except hot chocolate
i dont think it supports FAT32
i usually get cold "frappe" mochas
i know... i know.
i already use it
but i wanna see GX loader
nvm.
Wiiflow?
i do that at walmart if i need a boost as they have coffee in the break room
yeah
and if a need a desperate boost ill mix it with mountain dew
Ugh
isn't that disgusting?
actually its pretty good
mt dew over powers the coffee
i am a kid D:
xD
not really.
but i really like GUI
i fear i may become addicted to caffeen
lol
is there anyway to change CFG loaders font?
of course
lol don't worry
*dew
how o_o
i hate the font.
I don't drink anything with carbonation
Sina3, you can find a list of options for CFGLoader here: http://gwht.wikidot.com/configurable-options
pixelated
i use to not to unless i was desperate
now i dont mind it much
lol, shoulda seen her try my jelly belly soda
i still hate coke
I can't drink it
/me looks leerily for rdx
I hate how the carbonation feels
jelly belly soda?
and stops after the first sip
yeah, it wasn't very good
but it wasn't very bad either
jelly belly as in jelly bean?
LOL Sina3
yep
i hate jelly beans
not realizing that since it said "soda," it would be carbonated
lol
haha
I'm pretty sure it was
or did someone drug you
haha
:P
XD yeah
if that even
Woo, got HBC and the rest back on my 4.3 :)

07...
I mean - they fight wars all over the world, they dream about colonizing the moon and the mars, they fly into orbit, but they can't supply their towns with the electricity required?
show me something that's more of a fail :P
never heard of it, then agn I havent booted my wii up in awhile
2hm
well, maybe that's the reason why ALL power lines in europe are redundant. Two out of three can fail without a city blacking out :P
2lol
2yup
All, is it possible to downgrade IOS41?
2Timeshift, look at my above comment and it sums up an american politician
2they cant get anything done
refer to the part about being too cheap for any redundancy, and Lugianite's comment
yeah, they prefer "popular" topics over common sense
do politicians have control over that sort of thing? I'd have assumed engineers and city planners would have make most of the decisions...
right now it's cheaper to overpay workers to maintain live wires than to replace the old ones, even if it's more expensive in the long run
I have V3348 :(
dunno how it's done in america, but our states here have a budget and the cities have a budget, too
2trust me, its full of beurocratic BS
then it'll be fine

wine ftw?
LuciusMar, wine
I thought it was renamed to brickmii
or mono
also
another thing iphones can't do
QR codes
can't remember if it's .NET or native
those are fricking awesome
Android has it built in :D
mon
o
how can you say ewwww to a browser that actually uses HTML5
Though I'm positive I have run it in the past
apparently it has mono support
that is, no foolish hooks into the native world
mono it is then
13I like my iphone
6never realized how often drf hates apple on here
10Wb
10Chumera
6it really IS all the time
10CHUM
13you see him saying !apple every day
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
/me 13hides
LOL
i resent that remark
He has dreams about destroying apple products.
No I don't
LuciusMar, ...compile?
Dykam: distro?
I actually haven't :/
just run the .exe via mono
ubuntu
13except the fruit
you do know they oiutlast hardware wise
MuzerNtbk: I don't need to compile? >_>
Dykam: Debian (testing)
LuciusMar, no
has mono
install mono
run the exe through mono
WUT
???
:3
wait
/me noms
oh.
you need the winforms packages I think
yeah
I thought of mono as a framework
kinda fun
you do realize taht doesn't actually matter, right?
install the libmono-winforms2.0-cil package
|3
*that
13Guest
LuciusMar, it's more like the evil MS version of Java
it does
Apple hardware is waaaay inferior to proper hardware
prolly pulls in the mono framework too
13hey Quany
07Hmm, Java.
like you pay 3x the cost
I built my own computer
<MuzerNtbk> LuciusMar, it's more like the evil MS version of Java - you meant "evil ms", right?
it'll beat any mac hands down
not evil version
a *lot* less
and I have an i7
dude, they have a desktop thats $500
Quany, have you ever used CGI:IRC?
13mostly becuase of FSX
i have i7 as well
Runix, have you even seen the specs in that?
well, it's BASICALLY just Java
lol
:P
i paid $1300 for my MB Pro
which is why I said version
no...
java has no generics...
13Clooone
anyway, not going to defend
also, version can mean "equivalent", in more informal uses
(both are VM's , that's true)
07Java is a fish.
hey guys
07o3o
also keep in mind
that Mibbit basically took CGI:IRC and made it look fancier
CFGloader, how do you get it to autoload wbfs folder on a fat32 drive
instead of always trying to load wbfs1 part
How much do you have to pay to get that i7 in there?
like $4000?
13is there a i8
no.
if you previously worked for apple you get to mod it for cheaper
there's an i7 Extreme with 6 cores though
you worked for Apple?
13oh
13no
13don't even have a job
13oooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
XD
I do
NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 memory
I'm at it right now :)
13sorry
wow
Thank you, guys
/me adds a G to Damos's last statement.
i used to work with apple
I could easily upgrade it to a 260
It just wasn't out at the time
XD
and eh
well I'm talking about typical users
not Apple VIPs
if I were to walk in there
they'd sell me some crap and charge $2000 for t
*it
then you pay the price
less exploding, more worky
OK
13ebay
now keep in mind
:P
java's generics are just a way of hiding numerous casts
:D
lol
if you are about speed... :P
from a language and VM perspective, totally yes
12I has arts
orly?
what's wrong with NTFS?
anyway
6I'm here
NTFS is the biggest piece of junk when it comes to storing crap
07o3o
it just shares all the memory into one object instead of compiling it individually
13never heard of NTFS
thats why it runs slow the more you have open
4im back
Quads burn out quickly on normal PC's
trust me
orly
my friend spent $6k on his and it just went Poof
he had dual quads
wtf?
4 0.0
I spent a little over $1000
and that's mainly due to the 3 hard drives and the fact that I have a Blu-Ray burner.
13that must be a rip off
12http://a.imagehost.org/0971/Lugia124.jpg
13probably from ebey
is Blu-Ray readers, let alone even *burners*
13ebay*
lukegb, it lends from wine...
because I'm still having issues relating to getting mono to work with System.Windows.Forms <_<
07:D
12TRYING to
thus why i dont care
well I don't.
I like high def
:P
12it's not supposed to be
mono pokes into wine afaik
6perhaps, but at least you're trying :>
LOL
6I think it looks adorable
12Yeh maybe
13ITS AWESOME ARTI

Runix, why do they require you to use photoshop
13then use it
because you're a fanboy
Quany, HAVE YOU TRIED USING CGI:IRC
I asked like 3 times

12I do but I don't keep saying it OVER AND OVER AGAIN
13do you need to make a topic drf about the hate of Apple
07I was there last week.

can you make Mibbit auto-connect like mIRC can?
hi
07No, but you can set up a one-click connect.
is there a lisp binding? :p
10!sneas
07You can set up a script to instantly join any channel.
07Ghost, etc.
one click?
10:3
07Two, since you have to click the Account tab.
o.o
well
I told it to autologin
10Floofy would make more sense
/me hides
02It would be like: "I wanna hug his floof, but I don't wanna die"
07Okay.
07Under account:

helooooooo
07Under IRC server details.

analogue by comparison is continuous, hence the scale positions mentioned in that definition
I just took the first 5 letters

it's an actual movie though
03no.
both >.>
Oh
I heard of that one! :O
Since it is a comedy and such :o
I was gonna watch it.
For the giggles.
6Okay. I'll think of the thingymabob myself, then.
Now the thing I've been wondering
or thingamajiger
Is just how 004 happens
Well
Not how
Bannerbomb
it looks for bannerbomb, if it's found, err 004
But yeah, that
although
:3 I'd like to see the Wii tell me no
*goes to try it*
Wii sez NOU
oooooooooh
loool
but there is no need for bannerbomb if you just get one of those wiixplorer channnels or loadmeh *is proud of self-made channels*
XD It told me no
/me naps on Strykah's shoulder.
the main characters are two guys. maybe they're bi though but either way that interpretation is wrong :o
ufail
pwn2own
the only vampires shown in the movie are lesbians. apparently only girls can become lesbians
I mean..
VAMPIRES
<___<
XD
/me is a lesbian too!
Well that makes sense. :P
thinger
the whatsit
or the whatchamacallit?
Stupid laziness
that was a typo x_X
lol
/me is gonna go to help out with soccer registration
Yes :P

Okay, I'm restoring. XD
XD
how to ensure future homebrewing during 4.3: before updating, make a loadmii channel, or wiixplorer channel. update.
I hope you didnt see the movie LLOTS
exploitless
ftw
:P
I may do that in a minute
*notice the use of make a channel*
CustomizeMii, right?
yeah

Perhaps I should've done that for my cousin before he updated
:P
? softmod

/me fixed it.

Hi |Shadow| !

But, but, the Andres can not has be lesbian ;_;
haha
/me signs Andres up for a sex change :O

Nyuu.

/me would rather die.
lol, the little blocks on RestoreMii are like scrambled eggs
Dragonite and shaymin netsplit

/me loots the Curly >:3

Wait, if I can have the old one?
mmhm
/me transfers the mind and flirts with a Strykah.
03:3
own2pwn
now, make the loader channel
where, why, how, because?
Curly, yes...
Between them
Hmm no
Dragonite
did chanserv quit on dragonite?
My Downloads folder is SOOO disorganized
then dragonite didn't split :O
• Netsplit between dragonite.irc.epic-chat.net and shaymin.irc.epic-chat.net
shaymin split off dragonite
Yes
Between them
oh right, between >.>;
My poor shaymin's on shaky ground. D:
/me is shot
Shame, man.
/me props shaymin up
That's the second dragonite/shaymin split.
I'm leaving in like an hour :<
/me bites Curly on the nose D:
ouch :O
D: now how do I use this thing?
I know next to nothing about servers :/
You no likey? D:
I don't mind
I've been thinking about downloading inspircd and making my own server for a while, just to figure out how it works >.>
it was still ouch though :o
no
/me thought that he was gentle ._.
Good.
my computer's terrible anyway though
/me shivers.
~10 GB
Not much at all. Maybe 3MB.
hey is it posible for a wii to read a certain media (niponic) that another wii cant read (disc error) ?
I've got this micro SDHC card which I've been using with my Wii for a while
I have >!
>1 898 MB
:(
Trying to use it to add homebrew channel
And XP lol
right
I think I have 500mB of ram
/me has a sleep.
Curly, really?
mmhm
yes
it's an upgrade from my last computer
it had 256mB
I don't has money
My other one had 112MB
how long ago did you have that?
~3 years
Then I got a laptop
(eew)
I want a laptop
This one had 256MBs at first D:
B) Shouldn't be a problem
Then I added a 1GB stick.
/me pokes RegistrationAristeo
And then I added a 512MB stick!
that's a little odd
mishaps with websites, always fun to fix, but never to eat D:
do none of them support SDHC?
my brother's computer has 2*500mB with 2 free slots
I should upgrade that :I
I only have 2 slots. :(
But I've had two that just freeze up My Computer when I try to read the drive the SDHC card is in
When I unplug them they tell me it needs to be formatted
:/
Probably don't support SDHC
yeah
XD
isn't that the truth? X3
/me goes to get ready
Anyway, I've got file transferring working but it is a pain
Oh, on the CustomizeMii thingy, does it matter if the .dol is named boot.dol?
Sorry to interrupt
It's cool
Hyperiant, I don't know if modern methods require the archive bit set or not
Sonic41: no
that could have been a problem with the TP hack
/msg djp fix ur fucking connection
but I don't know if Bannerbomb needs it
http://www.pcworld.com/article/23867/dell_dimension_v333c.html
some phones might unset it
Thats the one I was using for years
Before I was born
thanks, i thought i did something wrong
*hunterm.
Period needed to end that first sentence
Sonic41: ok, load up the homebrew channel.
actually, no
make sure you have wireless
as it doesn't use a savegame
lol
you should be fine
Okay, loading...\
lol
they are a laptop series now
then, type in the ip address of the wii
(get it from the hbc)
click send
then, it should be transferred to the wii, and load up an installer.
I'm assuming I'm running SM 4.3 but I really have no clue
I probably have to restore before I can do anything
It's set to auto-update at the moment
Hyperiant, you can find out from the top-right corner of the settings menu
http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/code-cracked-cyber-command-logos-mystery-solved/?npu=1&mbid=yhp
there is no "auto update" option; you must always confirm every update
LaptopAristeo: http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/code-cracked-cyber-command-logos-mystery-solved/?npu=1&mbid=yhp

Alright, 4.2U

Hyperiant, wiiconnect24

Hyperiant, right, go into the SD Menu
I think I need something else on the card

/me hugs Stryker
Does 4.3 break custom channels
?
no
"Go on, before security comes!" She says as they bash my head in. ._.;
/me forces Curly to stay.
4.3 would break the LoadMii channel I think
:o
maybe not
but it breaks pretty much everything else
Prolly not
Does customize me use .net?
what's wrong?
yes
"Index (zero based) must be greater than or equal to zero and less than the size of the argument list."

ficarra10, click it and find out :)
some of these links are outdated
do it laters
i dont have wad manager.
Get it?
Cant install one, no sd
should i drop protection b4 the wep?
you dont need an SD to install wad manager
why use 2 drives?
format it all fat32
and have it on same drive
yes
but thats stupid and expensive
03x3
i found a 16gb sd card for $15
Cant i install wiimc w/o wad?
its for my sister inlaw
i dont want to buy her a 320gb external or anything
outch
wiimcthe wad is only the forwarder ...
thats expensive
a gig
my bad
how do i drop protection
on a wifi conn
lbiza
lol
lbiza, 192.168.1.1
|Shadow|: i know, i just think that i would be easier
sigh channel full of n00bs tonight
go to the wifi tab
04lol
=p
lol
no
:D
er do i change my router settings
shitfire
go to the browser on that
04:P
ds?
wtf
yes
ds!
yes
wtf man
dual screen = ds
they have 4 verisons out now
i dont have ds
a 5th next year
wtf
cuz thats step #1
and put the manual settings
from notebook to wii right?
ROTFLMAO
i had to fuck with u when u asked were to go put that address in
when i told u already
my wifi router is broadcasting
i put in the wifi name/and my wep key
04ohai
lbiza, 192.168.1.1
Anyone here use Genplus?
04Skylands!
ok
/me hugs
now whagt
like i told u already
then go to wifi tab
drop the protection down to wep
try setting router to broadcast on channel 1 or 11
ok :)
set a password u knpow
for wifi
with area code
no dash's
or spaces
whatever yours is
somthing u can remeber
now go to wii search fpor wifi connection
put in wep
10Heya
connect
then say no to updating
/me returns the hug
and follow the guide
...
yeah but apparently it doesnt suppose some common files
like SMS and such
well, I'd be kinda surprised if it did
isnt the next ds going to be 3d with no glasses?
I know fusion does both but that's more the exception than the rule
yeah but there was on on xbox a while back that did them all
04good
04you?
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
SMSPlus for SMS/GG on Wii
/me hoses LaptopAristeo
yes, we just had this conversation, lol
yeah sms had shinobi
ok i got it online
i dont wanna update right?
04ah bugger I need to go
|Shadow|: Ibiza said he had a wep key.
meh at most, just watching Lelouch
and LOL bye Xd
i know which is which
ok i changed it to wep
It stands to reason that he's already using wep
i dont update the system right?
then i got the cool 6 button controller
there is one on xbox that did them all
Also, only some routers use 192.168.1.1
_DiGiTaL_, there is emu for each
which emulator was that digtital
on wii
lbiza2: no updateign is bad
Also, though wep is easily cracked, it's not nearly the same as "removing protection"
evil thanks fuck me
is there a way in the sys to turn "updating" off permanently
/me fucks lbiza2
Hehe, you're back :D
:o
lbiza2, jsut ge tthe guide going
no more questions from u
get to softmodding

dupasugl, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related <-yea i seen that months ago and the sad thing is its only jap dsiware
fuckers
Exception (DSI) occured!
Homebrew Browser is mean
softmod for 4.2SD is downloading now
hbb... meh
_DiGiTaL_, dont get the 2 confuzed
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPPCvVmx5Ho&feature=related is disware witch is avalible in japan dsiware shop now
O_O
that doesn't look good
dupasugl, yes
its been xtracted on the SD card!
code dump*
jappan DSiWare only
oh
do u not understand
._.
DSiWare is region lockled
*wii
press the reset button on the wii
k, pressed
Brought me back to Homebrew Channel
is it? I must have just not hit anything outside my region then
Alright, on my way home
oh, dsi
never mind
n00bs
cant read today [Hideki]
/me freeze LaptopAristeo where he's at
I never can at 1:30am particularly well
now u won't be on ur way home :P
you dont is the simple answer
The author of the program does
LOL
yea
snap!
I dunno, someone recommended
hbb is nice...i like it..........when it works
yup
whatever pays the bills u know
Agreed
once you'd done a run-through of it's offering you don't really need it
I played FF13 on 360 i dont like it
and not because of the graphics
hrm, apparently it picks up later on
Straight line mapping is WEAK
but I dunno, I've not liked the linear nature of recent ones tbh
yeah like 40 hours later
bought a PSP for that one
you'd think I'd learn
In the settings, you can change the repository from which you can download homebrew
i havent booted my PSP in months and when i did boot it that was to update firmware for no damn reason at all
and without homebrew it would have never made it this long
or a GBC come to taht
I had a wonderswan but i dont count that since i returned it to play-asia
i told them it didnt work when really it just sucked
I don't like non backlit colour screens
Gamegear was before its time sadly :(
you need to be outside in the middle of summer before they work
I had one of those as a teenager
but it cost a fortune to keep it fed
and yes, I know there were NiCads but they didn't last long compared to alkaline batteries
my network is unsecure now
in hbb?
Yup
no shit?
Oh
i mean... does hbb have default locations to check or do you input an address?
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
It has default ones to check
Yup
It's already built in
04!balloon
D: _DiGiTaL_ died
i should check that out
lbiza2, 4.1 or 4.2?
It's awesome
I dunno if you can add more repos
That sucks
yeah, it's odd
?
or does it not matter?
:O I just thought of something... I can say that I can brick the Wii and never repair it to my siblings as a threat... But that'd be mean.
:3
you have to follow through with it
you did it the wrong way ibiza
to show'em you mean business
follow exactly as said
Install an application that automatically boots the Wii into Never Gonna Give You Up looped unless you input Konami Code
you probably went in the wrong menu
should i prepare the bootmii as an SD card
Does such an app exist?
XD
oh man
that's a good idea
what's the dev chan?
i dont think my sys could boot it as 'boot2'
or w/e
Hmmm
It doesn't exist, but there's apps that run apps at startup I believe
Perhaps I could try to make an app like that
i have a request for an app
I am still learning C++, and that could be a project
no clue
ramo34
and i don't know why no one has made it yet
i inst bootmii an IOS and installed homebrew channel
I dunno HOW I could make it though
you should prepare the card
my birthday card
SD card
the only way i know to get it to do that is to walk up to the wii and hold down the power button the front of it
STFU
lbiza2, dont listen to AndrewH
i know i dont
i was tryin to get tarcis or ur attn
I want to use the wii shop channel, but it tells me i HAVE to update to use it, is there a way around this? i just want free demos
Eh, I've never had to use it
AndrewH, just downlaod the full wad's of the games and install them
wad manager
should i 'prepare the SD card'
yes
k
cuz i already ins homebrew chan and the other thing
wb
ty
the only thing i didnt do is DVDx and i have a feeling thats just for ripping shit
Sonic41: yes
u need to prep as hackmii installer tells u to for bootmii
:O
Go download it nao
For MPlayerCE, I believe you can use DVDx
anyone use wiiMC?
I do
:D
lol, |Shadow| proved correct
cIOS 202 specifically
Sonic41: have you tried Smashing!?
you ever had a problem with the audio not syncing with dvd?
Smashing?
hio
yes
awesome arcade target shooter
actual 3d!
:O
not open source though :'(
Gimme link nao
Should I download r590 or 0.76
Awww
(
I have a feeling 0.76 is more stable
*:(
dvdx, you questioned me about it a week or two ago
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Smashing!
Back!
wow
That looks AWESOME
:D
that is really polished
mmhmm :D
haha nice
That's WiiWare quality right there
hio again
Lebron
If you hired say fifty of them for a designing army you could churn out the best games ever on a regular basis
a lot of indie developers aren't on a schedule like a regular enterprise is
but it wouldn't be fun anymore
Has any one here ever played any of the old King's Quest series of games?
heres the deal
Yah
i wish there was a wiiware version of netflix
YES
whats up :O
instead of having to load it off the stupid disc
03Hewwo o.o
too much stupid suspense just tell me already
I wish there was a WiiWare version of Pandora
speaking of which
i'm on pandora right now
nothing much
Is there a homebrew Pandora client
hyperdub or go home
that would be beautiful
But it DEFINITELY would be possible
/me squeaks.
:( HBB frose
"Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I can type 'throw boot'!" or "Stupid cat... stop eating the rat before I have the boot." or "Stupid cat... stop eating the mouse when I enter from the wrong side of the screen!"
*froze
curse and reset
12o-o
I tried running Pandora in the Opera browser on the Wii
said not enough memory
****ing thing doesn't work
Okay, resetting
There
witch is SLOW
I've read too much WiiBrew wiki
I know too much
lol
And infinitely loop
hey guys
Yes
is the homebrew channel in a downloadable and installable version anywhere?
lol
whats up SR
yes
whats that mean
:3
www.bootmii.org
get the hackmii installer
i grabbed that
can that run from the homebrew chan somehow? [older version]
ok install it then
6Hey, those old Sierra games are like that.
How come when I load MPlayer CE it's cut off at the top and bottom
Wii is set to widescreen, that shouldn't happen
That's weird
:P I remember when my little brother and I would have movie night every night after I hacked the Wii
*I installed homebrew
how is people?
its all about bootmii
you know the usual
http://imgur.com/627lz.jpg its all about wiimc
how is you?
once i get to the pt of playing should i just use an ext hdd?
Smashing beats Link's Crossbow Training by a longshot
or can i load it on SD card?
lol
wiimc is nice...but I prefer my wdtv :P
*long shot
WDtV ftw
wdtv?
Although Sierra copy protection is annoying... the games are still hilarious and fun.
doesnt even buffer my 41gb untouched BR of avatar
i'm doing a xbmc ion setup
(Though... some of the "hunt the pixel" puzzles get old quick.)
plays that fucker smooth
and clan
clean*
:/
all copy protection is annoying yet easy to fix lol
crossbow... longshot...
ok once my SD card is "prepared" do i need to use the NAND backup?
!define flamming
-!- FlÃ¥m is a Norwegian village with some 500 inhabitants, at the inner end of the Aurlandsfjord, an arm of the Sognefjord. The town is located in the municipality of Aurland, in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.
er back up my NAND
fail XD
lol
you really should just read the damn guide and do it
X3
running xbmc
whether u like it or not
Unintended effect, thar
Smashing should have it's own channel
and then every time i see my pchinterface i wanna puke
Now THAT would be awesome
exiles i was still using my old xbox on a sd tv i have but the dvd drive finally went out
however /add is a unknowncommand
lol
i have 2 boxes
there a site for hbb or is it just through wiibrew?
ha
I think through WiiBrew Only
*only
(But otherwise... you can make as many copies of the CD/diskettes as you want. :P )
04o-o
both 100% working
then the gc, the ps2, the 360, and workingon getting a wii
wow...0_o

Yup

03How are you watching videos then?!
It's the latest update to Clirc
30 or 36
03:O
03does it have a web browser?
:O
03then what's it do?
upgrade to 4.2 then downgrade to 3.3
You get someone else's laptop
And view videos there
Ain't it amazing?
03LOL
Oooo, delete IOS30
03so how do you paste the links here? o.o;
But it's a stub
I didn't
And it would't make a difference if I downgraded with DOP-Mii
XP
03you typed that whole thing?
/me pounces WetBunnyfox
It wasn't a long or complicated link, drf.
03I suppose
03but wait
03if you have a laptop, why 'not just use IRC on it?
Because it sucks.
03what?
03if it's good enough to watch streaming videos
03it's good enough to run mIRC
Maybe, but the keyboard makes me want to punch cattle
03LOL
It likes to go back whenever I hit backspace
03that's... the point
03web browsers are SUPPOSED to go back when you hit backspace
03mIRC does not have that problem
For?
And for some reason, when I'm in the middle of typing, the type cursor thing appears in a random place

03that's the trackpad's fault, probably

anybody got the scoop on this oen?
03and you can usually turn the trackpad off, if you use an external mouse XD
huh?
There is no mouse
03no I know
03I mean, get one
oh
03you can buy a mouse for like $5

http://sharingmatrix.com/file/1005427/Shopping_Channel-NUS-v18.rar
this is whats in the 3.1-4.1 guide
but id say just follow the whole guide
thanks, but version v18 is old and doesnt work anymore
its the one I had
i found that I need to download dop-mii
|Shadow|, CFGLoader worked with installing discs to disk, thanks alot :)
Hmmm, maybe I should brick the Wii every night
All you need to do is install shop channel v19 using dop-mii or wad manager. It works with the old revision of IOS61.
Dop-Mii -- DOP-Mii Download
Start HBC - Load Dop-Mii -- Press A at the warning.
Select IOS249 or 250 --(Use the D-Pad) -- Press A
Select "Channels" -- Press A
Install Shopping Channel v19
lol Or that
:P
bye all
Like bricking? XD
2gtg now
2cya guys~
worked
how about a homebrew solution that straps onto bootmii, requires a code?
it'd have to have a cool ui, though
cool UIs are boring
whuuuut. it's the the user experience. a cool program like a wii login should look amazing
2.0 gloss and everything
and it wouldn't even have special glyphs, if you pressed up it would be ^
or not even anything, like sudo
Oh, just a simple button combination?
that's my kind of ui :D
make it the konami code :P
lol Oh yeahhhh
If you're talking programming abilities, I can only create functions, if statements, couts, cins
I somewhat understand do while loops
what's there to get?
D:
I hate that. It's usually simple, and I make it harder than it needs to be
for is a bit trickier
6AERO
6:>
O:
hello~
basically only want to use while when the outcome cannot be put into a range
or when you're looping on a condition
Oh, I think I understand for
while ( !succeed ) { try(); }
like while (!passwordValid()) {printf("%s", "Invalid password!");}
that would be an infinite loop
goes good
*well
or w/e
alskdfjakl
just as much fun, though
6ovo
6Okay.
6So...
I'm waiting for a corrected loop
I'm on the edge of my seat wondering how it's going to turn out
6Where are they? ovo
lol
s/passwordValid()/checkPass()/
I'm not going to upload them today 'cause I'm too lazy/tired too. >_>
see, passwordValid() must be a dictionary, pulling from a file or a database or something
*to
dfklasdjflkadsjf
6T'morrow?
it pulls from globals
Oh wait, he's ACTUALLY making the app now? :O
that's dumb
I'll upload sometime
soon
6Okay.
6Good night.
'cause I'm still exhausted from that plane flight and I don't really want to think right now
'night
while ( !passwordValid("tpw_rules")) { AskForPassword(); }
that's great O:
6And, erm, my internal clock is still off.
and another thing -- you want a pause or a lockout for a certain amount of tries
yup
well I'll upload whenever I have the motivation to
:( Awww. Oh well
'cause right now I just want to relax
while (tries < 3) { doPass(); }
and I don't want to deal with this scanner now
i could hack it into loadmii
but not hbc or bootmii
that's too iterative
i don't have the source
yeah
i prefer python :D
sorry, tpw
is bootMii not public source?
I guess that makes sense
neither is hbc
6Lol.
yeh
still...
6Gonna complete another thing on my to-do list tomorrow. :>
they could do some modulary things
take plugins
bootMii plugins would be bitchin'
/me 6wants to finish that fanfic. D:
(login app)
that would be really hard to do for bootmii though
hbc should be easier
actually, just set parental controls on it
a login app wouldn't have any value on hbc
or parental controls
fuck, take the SD card away
lawl
omg -- my devkitPro still won't work
Yeah, taking the SD Card out would probably be the easiet way
I have all these good ideas, and I can't do anything
Hey
g++/gcc and what's included?
Hello!
yeah
pretty sure
i hooked it up to xcode :D
:D
macfag?
not sure
(rather, non-Mac platform?)
not sure
sure do
yw
can't develop for shit, but it's my only OS
tpw_, I like you
you seem like a good kid
lolthx
but the definition of "macfag" is not exclusive of any other software you might happen to own
/me gives AeroDrawcohem a fork
(macfag)
>_<
uhm.
no, I suppose not
not really
there's nothing outrageously important I'd need it for
good
lol
...
okay?
wtf. why won't this shit build.
cause it hates you
i can has code?
it's not the code, they're examples
oh
I'm not doing anything
D:
>:O
yelling is mean :<
well, uh
fine.
I'm sorry, tpw
lol
/me doesn't really care
to formalize my apology:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/examples/wii/
here
tpw_rules: little boy get outta here
Crisco: stfu, i has ops
WHUT.
O_O
13 kthx
sorry
(true)
hahaha
I admire his initiative, then
of all the places you can end up in the world
a wii development channel on IRC is probably in the top 30
i hate people irl though
see? probably top 10.
now you're only one year younger than me :D
WTF>
Crisco: 2 months
where'd he go?
...
xdpirate: backups?
(the default one)
read the topic@
lolwat
xdpirate: type !rules
tpw_rules: when can I haz voice?
i know the rules
dunno
in a year?
xdpirate: srsly, it's backups
we won't help you with usbloaders
i was told to use CFG
it also works alot smoother
iirc yes
where? can't find it =/
I don't know
alternatively does dvd-r work on wii?
I only use CFG where it's easy to change themes
lbiza2, dvd-r works if you got an older wii
the latest?
newer wiis have the D3-2 disc drive which doesn't read burnt cds
I haven't used my wii for a while
The v57b7-222 .dol?
I guess
"Change the theme path in the settings to one of the folders that contains a theme"
or i just play the dvd-r like any other
lawl
3 strong supports and a support
LU39725
is the beg of my serial
is that old enuf?
Hi
You're a strong support.
/me cries
or once the mod is done i can just play fromthe dvdr with no sd card
2o.o
/me offers tissue to WetBunnyfox
/me eats it
n.n
I'm 3/4 strong supports
/me hms
NOU
and if you install usbloader gx as a channel you don't need an sd card, but you'll have no place to store covers
i installed as a channel
/me offers WetBunnyfox a pokeball
me too
but i can inst both right?
yes
gonna go eat O:
/me eats it
which is the latest version?
CorBot: Can I support you? :o
/me doesn't know what's going on
b57b7
Of course!!
i bleave
He's a strong support, clearly.
ok
he v57b7.dol which loads IOS249 first can be downloaded directly from here.
The v57b7-222 .dol
which one of these?
:o
u need to install it first

Hi where!

/me steals it
I need a spanner wrench
thanks

Curly: Look at the topic.
Apparently the Wiimote's power button is disengaged w/ a code dump on screen. :)
oooooh
oh yeah
code dump = reset button
xP
hokay, off for real this time
yeah. most people dont even try to read before they start asking xP
/me pats the server and hugs everyone

Lol
/me turns on some music, and give HBB another whirl. :)

Why can I not do this >D
Dragonite's a bully.
/me breaks the lego gun

dragonite's a pushover with an omistar
/me rebuilds it and shoots Proto

Hey Proto
D:
Mosquitos are evil
/me sets up an air defense system for #epic-chat
and some of them actually /stung/
which was weird
yeah, I've been a few places like that
hmm, not were they actually stung though
they weren't actually stinging
but their bites hurt
do the stings itch like the bites do?
it feels like a sting
heh
florida! humidity!
and like a dozen would come at you at the same time <_<
and I don't think the stinging ones itched
probably because they didn't bother injecting you with anything to stop the pain
Well at least it doesn't nag at you then like it does when it itches
there were lots of non stingy ones up there too >.>
some of the mosquito bites swelled up like crazy
generally the ones rubbing against my clothes
the ones at my ankles and the ones under/near my bra strap were the worst >_>
I hate ankle bites
my socks only make the itching worse
/random
04hi
it's a cute idea though :3
lol, did not know that

lisp LOOKS godlier
lua is most-used in my circles
lua's weird imo
i only used it to write some script for an emulator
Most of my potential work involves coding with the Source engine and some THQ games I still muck around with
me either
which only uses lua coding
How do you set ChanServ to flood protect
unless there's a python compiler for the wii I probably won't learn it
/cs set flood lines:time I think
#channel name in there somewhere
ummm
um
it's not
that's
python isn't compiled
ooh cool, source engine
it's interpreted
okay
I knew it was wrong >_>
i want to get garry's mod except a) it costs money and b) parents won't let me get it
Yes :3
/mode #channel +f <# of line>:<per seconds>
Executed code maybe
yes it does
Knew it.
:O Why won't they let you get it?
5 lines per 8 seconds would be like
/mode #channel +f 5:8
Things to ponder: "When sign makers go on strike is there anything written on their signs?"
/me pokes Corevette789
haha

wells fargo has teen checking
Yea, that's how I roll. If I don't know about it then I dont take the risk
Teen checking? Never heard of that
I'm using it actually
oh man
They give you a debit/ATM
essex[sX]: lol, how old?

lol
It's cool, just get them to buy you a $10 prepaid
:O!
Weird, though
i was first!
LOL
tpw, how is it that you're allowed to come to a Wii hacking forum, but not allowed to get certain games? :P
and the annoying thing is that they let me play it at friends' houses
here?
they kinda don't know
they only know i'm in one channel on a different network
never really told them iirc
sux2bh
but they're basically "yeah, yeah that's great now come to dinner"
:P
yerp
lol, mine don't even know about my "internet life"
lol
LOL FCHAN BLORL
They only know that I run unsigned code on the Wii, and that if I brick, that's my fault
hah
my wii is mine
lol, not at all
:P
tpw_rules: you rang?

hahaha
drf's a mirco$not fanboi
/me hides
/me added to Curly's time on idlerpg. :)
they googled netflix o_O
And I'm thinking -_-
my family only knows 99% of online things because of me
lol
the really fucking annoying thing is i accidentally introduced them to lolcats
D:
But I don't think they're doing that again.
they don't know/don't care about the gigabytes of illegal shows i torrent
:P
ahh
A minute..AND A HALF
wally swap?
i need to figure something out
/me lays down and purrs like a kitty :3
I swear, they think they need to put filters on me? :P It is I that should be putting the filters on them
is anyone familiar with crap or loadstructor?
Sonic41: i do that xD
tpw_rules: even though youve already seen them? ;P
yup
04o-o

Does anybody have any beanbags? I’m really in the mood to play some cornhole.
ha ha
inappropriate lolcats...where?!
tpw_rules: youre really 13? O_O
ewww, inappropriate lolcats
a) yes and b) their sibling sites

I hope they didn't find 4chan
people are over-rated
lol
OMG EVIL!
-_-
hahaha
i really don't believe it
:P
Yeah, I pretty much handle anything that goes wrong -- tech-wise, anyway
I was just minding my own business and I /tripped/ into you D:
/me runs away in tears
Inspired me to become one
Now everyone comes to me for tech support when they cba to bother him
/me slaps Stitch
don't make curleh cry D:
:P
/me thinks kitties are too lazy :P
day
One of my mom's friends wanted me to set up her router
It wasn't hard... all she had to do was follow the instructions
you can't let anyone know you know about technology
NEVER
hehe
-_-
if you let them know you can do it
they'll never stop bugging you
"hey... essex... how do i GOOOGOL something?"
xkcd agrees :P
lol
the problem is people tend to piss me off
i'm NOT a people person
:P
You like to sit and code, huh? :3
yup
computers don't say no :D
I'm a people person
peer is a jerk
lol
essex[sX]: he didn't do anything here
i just got a standard quit
http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/?p=14930 hot
Yeah, I'm actually a people person
But when I try to bring my knowledge into a conversation, they're all... "lolwut"
i hate crowds
whats the shortcut to connect to a server?
And it's saddening, because noone else shares the knowledge that I do
essex[sX]: /server <server>
..
:D
/me emocorners.
:P I guess that's why I've stuck with the Wii scene for awhile
lol
do you OFFICIALLY have aspergers?
or are you self diagnosed?
probably selfdiagnosed
or parentally diagnosed
I was professionally diagnosed with aspergers but apparently I've "grown out of it"
D:
i think i have a touch of aspergers
I like to think I was just a little jerk when I was little
No, I closed my laptop
i think if you really have aspergers you just dont understand sarcasm
i'm kinda bad at that
http://media.peopleofwalmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1441.jpg
*doesn't
And I'm bad at detecting textual sarcasm
I had a channel named the #emocorner once >.>
my parents get annoyed though cause i use it to insult people
I never use sarcasm
Evetr
:o
ever
lol
like me
noooooooooooooo
Curly:
i don't have aspergers
I'm the most non-sarcastic person in the world
i'm just an asshole
well asperger's is kinda defined as not good socially xP
Hyperiant: lol
O:
lol
essex[sX]: well, my psyciatrist said that i had aspergers
http://www.epic-chat.net/wiki/Channel_modes
:D
From http://www.epic-chat.net/tutorials

/me nods

lol
Yeah, #wiidevot has died
#wiihelp == #wiidevot
HA!

why'd you get banned?
I cut off 4 minutes :3

* You have been kicked from #wiidevot by iGoogle (Banned: annoyance)"
Mrr

tpw_rules, wazzup
you highlited me
oh, sorry
shall i also do the Hermes cIOS?
we dont support "black" wii's here
:)
ok, it was brown
next i think i need to replace the dvd
if you know a good place for dvd that would be great...
or shall i just use a modchip? not sure....!
wii's dont come in brown
u realy want me to say it?
we dont support "ni¶¶3r" wii's here
GeneraLee, modchip still wont get dvdr's working
oh yes you are right
its a hardware thign tht cant be changed
only thign to do is replace the dvdrom drive
but why?
for the dvd
You guys know a place selling dvds...?
swap out the board for a board with all three chips
fuck replacing
I swapped the board on mine
from an old bricked wii
:D
yes, but for GC games, until they release the GC Loader, the only way is through dvd-rs...
GeneraLee aka DannyZee
thats why i wanted to replace the dvd
:D
fuck that
vipdergc's r only like 45 bux
/me has two chipped gc as well :D
/me too
qoob on mine
GeneraLee, then there u go
update it
:D
latest is um 2.6 o think
but it would be great to play gc backups on the wii also
Good to see you =)
no it wont
gc backups on wii are not working well... I've got strange framebufferbugs and shit.
most games are 100%... but many are fucked yp

whatever, same diff I suppose
actually there is a significant performance increase from C2Q to Ci7
hm
not really worth $300 though
plus my C2Q is 2.24GHz, that's I believe 2.37
the i7
no, 2.67
which is nice
03o.o
mine was only Â£30-40 above the C2Q I was considering
and it oc'd nicely to 4GHz with a watercooler
:o
/me cough
is it a laptop though?
o.o
I know
but it costs a ton as well as I showed
(customized, that is)
well ill see yous later
now $400 of that was a Blu-Ray drive
which my laptop has
14o.o#
take the Blu-ray drive out and get one yourself for like Â£70, maybe less now
for a laptop?

uhh
well now it wont run anything
.28 mbs wtf is happenin?
no loader.
the disc channel
i couldnt get event he retail copy to work with the dsic channel
do i need a loader now?
You need a loader retard
thanks :)
loader
5What is it?
whats a good loader?
go with cfg
cfg
www.cfgloader.com
great loader
6It's pretty fun, takes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time to download though
http://gwht.wikidot.com/usb-loader
infact you'd be plain silly to go with anything else!
i couldnt find a channel version of that
5Geez.
5And OMG
there's forwarder channels
5MY TABLET IS WORKING WITH SAI. :DD
get one
5Finally!!!
6YAY
i got mg2 to work with neogamma
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
use a forwarder
6I dun have PS
6:(
even GIMP has its strong points
6I have MS paint and GIMP lol
get neogamma for that
/me cough
yeah cuz i dont have an sdcard i can dedicate to that.
and expensive per gb
get an SD card anyway, they are like $10
ok
a good sd card is important if you want to use much homebrew
2GB regular SD card
anything that can install as a channel, and load dvd-r
the channels are not the loader
Neogamma, but use a forwarder channel
forwarder?
that way when the program updates you dont have to update the channel
doesnt that require it to run from an sdcard tho?
the loader is homebrew, the wad installs the forwarder that runs the homebrew (loader)
yes
good luck
pretty much
gee thanks.
they are dirt cheap and you can buy them anywhere
tehy are right next to the pack of gum
can't priiloader be set to run an installed boot.dol ?
or that might be off sd still
*photoshopper
?
/me hides
yea
5That too.
5Sometimes she uses PS, sometimes she doesn't.
also can depend on the sector size
or, chunk...what you pick when you format
Its fat32
ok..you can set up to 32kb...
16k chunk gives good performance
have ... ?
Seagate GO 320gb
ok neogamma works fine
is there a .wad version of neogamma u can run as a channel without an sdcard?
There ya go

That's because you worked for them >_>
03ih :3
At least when I go to their store people are always smiling, awaiting hand a foot live servants
Like
if my ext hd that holds only my wii backups is showing up as raw is there anyway to partition it with a fat32 drive as well without losing the games?
like
I went there one time
tried to buy something in iTunes on an ipad
asked them how to cancel it
they were like "Um, can you?"
I was like "Can you?"
they were like "I don't think so"
I was like "... you really can't cancel a download?"
You can't
"Nope."
It's standard and law
now I have to wait 48 hours
for their lame excuse for Wi-Fi
to download this 3GB file
and I was like, can you fix this pleaseS?
they were like um, I don't know how
Hahaha
I was like, real genius tehre
I tried renting a movie on iPad
I did and it was awesome
it told me 48 hours left
and Iw as like f this
but I couldn't cancel it
nor get my money back
Yea a 48 hour limit
........
Like renting a movie in store
I MEAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO DOWNLOAD
Don't need to yell
Lol
still
Still, you don't understand the company like I do
and I can't even get 5 minutes of peace without them going "You sure you don't want to buy anything?"
and I'm like "NO I DON'T THANK YOU"
viince: if you think thats cool , there used to be a program dealy to make the disc channel play backups too.
You need to know the terms
...
I just buy parts and whatnot
I built my own computer
you can't build a Mac
As did I
Then it was stolen
and whose fault is that
and it requires i have a fat32 section on my hd
proly have to copy them somewhere
I mostly email and browse their site
orly?
And order
a format is usually destructive
I thought you worked for a website comapny
*company
Yes
I can create events
mebbie partition magic can help
I have a league and tournaments hosted, and I deliver supplies to stores
but you don't actually work for PokÃ©mon USA, do you?
I do
Under organized play
oh
like movies and whatnot?
I can
can you get PokÃ©mon movies in HD?
To show it off, not to sell before the time
but if you have the games them it might be easier to put them back on after the format
I got 2 and 3 from Apple TV, which cost me a fricking fortune
and it didn't even work right
well i have a ext 500 gig passport i believe it is
which is again Apple's fault
I said organized play only
oh
rather than mess about
that doesn't help then
I'm an encoder
no free agent go
I need audio/video material :P
i know
And I just need a proper system that is lit weight and portable
Lint
and how many gamea are on it
10Hey Chumera
Light*
LOL fail
have you seen the Lenovo U1 Hybrid?
6lol
proly not
I don't want lento
does wiiflow still work with fat32?
Lenovo
should right
ni
Skldjfghsfdjkhsfdnj
how come?
is that a no
its a no idea
ahh sorry
Because I don't want any system like that
It's plastic
:D
as total no brainer....
I hate computers using plastic as a shell
WODE just works
its genius
the U1 Hybrid is a tablet, like the iPad, but it has a base that you can snap it into with a real processor that turns it into a netbook
I idle to watch the clever people sort out peoples home brew/haxx0r skillz
The lenovo doesn't have 3G built in for roaming and emailing
:P
03o.o
I don't need any of that though
I just want this for my work
14>> 4WinAmp 14<> 12Pokémon 14<> 3Pokémon Heroes Soundtrack - no year 14<> 7no title 14<<
This I can just click, slide and it's ready 24 hours a day
14lol
or you can use 'baxkups' you find on the Interweb
14Incomplete downloads fail XD
;D
the main waste of plastics is in packaging, then lego. Plastic casings are going to carry on a long way yet
invisible to the firmware too
Works for me
5 /sooooooooooo lost
Less waste and it's recycled material
currently at least
Runix	The lenovo doesn't have 3G built in for roaming and emailing <-- I think it does
it's not actually out yet
Exactly
It's not out yet
My point stands clear
that ARE out
that have keyboards and everything
and you can fold the screen down and use it as only touchscreen
This was available earlier
um, no?
see
Bad bad company
the tablet computer has been out for ages
you're every bit as brandname biased as I am
I just don't like Apple
hey uh
is there anyone worse than apple?
14Heya Quil
14k
I'm not sure...
and you didn't hear about the guy's iPhone that had its battery explode?
Only because he messed with it
Apple have had problems with exploding batteries for years
hence why I built my own
Hence why this conversation is over
money-wise, sure
(again, same with Apple)
thousands of iPods have exploded over the years, Apple just gives the victims a free replacement and some monies and the press doesn't hear
Iv had nothing but parts dieting and replacements, then customer service to even replace anything
Dieing
Apple included
Face it, the iPad was just there when I needed it for work, the others weren't
like at least 2 years
the iPad is -late- to the scene
longer than that
I hate tablet pcs
I don't need anything overpowered
Vista launched with support for them and there was extensions for XP before that
I just browse pokemon.com, email, and order
LOL overpowered
though 7 is the only one to do it well
I don't need a tablet for the work I di
Do
I need somthing light and portable and doesn't overheat ever
an Android phone?
/me hides
This always stays cold
I don't need a phone either
I have the Motorola Droid
I wait
and since I have Verizon that worked out fine
/me randomly hugs Sky :3
<Runix> I need somthing light and portable and doesn't overheat ever <-- Lol, and the iPad doesn't have overheating problems?
I've never used one for more than 2 minujtes
-j
it overheats quite easily from stories
...
people conducting weddings with iPads, LAME
XD
yeah, Apple has been behind the times since like the 80s
10:O
6meow
6meow
yeah
iPods are just stupid
LOL
they don't try to make their own hardware
10!espeon !sneas !arcanine\
I cant set a limit
like Intel
try and fail
*cough*
XD
still
there's no such thing as a "Microsoft built computer"
you'll have parts from other places
Apple, on the other hand, just brands everything - both hardware and software, as theirs
5All my friends that have Macs are all, "But Macs (even though they're more expensive) last way longer than PCs and never have ANY VIRUSES or ANY PROBLEMS and blah blah blah..."
yep
LOL RP4L, yeah, but you'd be surprised
04o-o
What's a tag? :o
they can quite easily, there just aren't any (yet)
there are viruses
lemme find this pic
no, there are
just not very common
*many, then
but if you get like, pirated software
it's common to see viruses

yeah sorta
Or different shift?
But seriously they should promote me to manager of electronics
wtf
dont think they have a manager of electronics
They'd probably pay me a ton more
Hello nyte

04lol
04hey Quan

I was thinking of the one near school, but OK :P
7Hey, Ly.
oh okay
o.o
disc*
how do you know that/
*?
7Almost done with nutsy music arrangement.
supervisor told me
I thought you meant the awesome electronics department you have up there
he thought i might be interested in moving up as a career
04uh...sure?
Listen, I
O.O
He offered you a prmotion?
any way someone can please send me cios 223 v5 base 37 made in a wad?
no
aww
just showing me the ropes
I see
go fish
I think I need something
I need it in order to follow this rb2 guide to get all my dlc to play off the hd
cause apperently i'm one of the only people that does more than my job...
7Ah, before I send you the link: have you heard of chiptune?
and then turn alt.dol off again
04...nope
But I wouldn't mind a promotion as it would pay more
heh turn the volume down though
eh with a promotion comes crap from the [censored] hill
sexual can u please help for a min i need cios 223 v5 base 37 wad
yep
10hello person
the crap rolls downhill
why v5
the only one immune to it is whoever owns Walmart
in order to use uloader
this guide i am following says to get it
hi
7Hey?
why do you want uloader, its ugly ;p
I'd never get promoted anyway only working part time. XD
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FCZwAUYhnOMJ:gbatemp.net/t237966-tutorial-rockband-2-ntsc-dlc-all-songs-on-hard-drive%3Fview%3Dgetnewpost+rock+band+dlc+opn+hard+drive&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us
its good but ugly
i dont even think the waltons own a majority of shares in walmart anymore
I mean, I'm full time now, but when school starts I won't be
yeah
ummm
bc i need it to point out to hd for dlc
heh
this i swhat the guide says
well just grab the cios222 v5.1 installer
any other loader allow that
I'm going to try
?
which works perfectly because the Walmart here wants all the 1st and 2nd shift people to become part time
And also apply at some other places
Anything to avoid the freaking cafeteria
the guide even links you to the cios installer
there's a bus
:P
04I saw
owo
04and it makes absolutely no sense to me'
and avoid any of the wispering going on in the background
...if that makes sense
04yes
14back
no word yet
i thought you wanted snes ;p
just got 2 wiis here droped off to softmod and run usbloads , but they both upgraded to 4.3 aruggg

sexual it says i need cios 223 v5 base 37 but with the 5.1 loaded i dont see the option
7So, yeah.
can i make apps i see on Homebrew channel as regular channels?
Athenon, gc controllers work with both vc games and gc games tho?
to go where no one has gone before with total anonymaty
starts off ios 259 i went through them i dont see a cios 223
i mean 249 sorry
but i dont see it here for an option
cios 223 v5 base 37
if youd read carefully ud see that it asks which ios to USE
for the installation
04oic Quan
oh sorry thank u
7So, I tried two pianos, but then there's a part with three harmonies.
i tried 223 with 37
