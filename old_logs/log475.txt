<richfiles> LOL! Alister... You go wax off! :D
<Alister> Buytoast: I GREATLY agrre
<Alister> agree*

<twilight_sprinkler> CrimsonPhoenix: well yeah, thats who this is
<cachi01|MW3> a

<Ninjazz> Dat is heavy shiz right there...
<Alister> richfiles: I clap to ponies ( I did not misspelled that)
*CECtheRonin whistles
<Calamity> He has admitted he has made mistakes
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinikler wait for Nitchy McPicky to point out that mistake
<CrimsonPhoenix> That guy with the glasses is better
<Om> Ninjazz: YOu woul know, ninshiz
<grovyleshy_wood> Jackie Chan is kewl.
<Buytoast> Surprise surprise. He wins because he's Jackie Chan.
<twilight_sprinkler> ^
<Tov|Calvinball> I need to rewatch the remake, I fell asleep in the middle.
<sagas> Buytoast: Duh
<grovyleshy_wood> Guys, did you know that Ask That Guy did something with MLP?
<richfiles> LOL, somepony else said wax off. Just a joke. :P
<twilight_sprinkler> i liked the original BANZAI scene more
<Ninjazz> Om: Now that is just dirty.
<geeky-brony> fire
<FlareChaser> I KNOW
<Aircrafter> Neither Win. I think Pinkie Pie wins.
<grovyleshy_wood> And on his Facebook page said he watched it and he didn't like it much.
<Dken2021> grovyleshy_woodo meh, not that much
<CECtheRonin> Hehe, fresh and juicy.
<Dark92Enigma> Old 1: New:1 NO SPOILERS PLEASE
<Triple> lol pinkie pie wins
<Alister> Dark92Enigma: Nitchy Mcpicky is just very insulting way of representing his critics
<Triple> XD
<Om> Ninjazz: I'm not the one thinking that way.
<richfiles> Buckin' FIRE!! So can Pinkie! :O
<Dken2021> the douchebag villians
<Buytoast> Do people actually watch this guy's useless rambling and think he has a good opinion?
<sagas> the villans arnt very morally ambiguous and are bland
<twilight_sprinkler> Buytoast: he sometimes does
<sagas> I like that
<Alister> Buytoast: I know ! There are way better reviewers online
<twilight_sprinkler> Buytoast: i mostly watch his stuff for laughs
<MahBoi777> Aircrafter: ofc Pinkie always wins
<Tov|Calvinball> Doug Walker's opinions seem sound to me.
<geeky-brony> lol
<Dken2021> Buytoast I watch just for entertainment, I don't consider him an actual reviewer
<|Discord|> LOL iwas just wathcing this
<geeky-brony> :D
<sagas> Hes just entertaining
<Dark92Enigma> GOD I need a Girlfriend lol
<Darkts33> =/
<mitamaking> I kind of like the teacher being nuts
<Tov|Calvinball> I trust him and his ilk more than professional critics
<DaringDude> yes new one wins
<grovyleshy_wood> DAYUM
<DaringDude> LOL
<twilight_sprinkler> i may not always agree with NC reviews, but some of his reviews are absolutely hilarious
<Darf14> lol
<Darkts33> sounds fun
<|Discord|> lol
<geeky-brony> :D
<CECtheRonin> Haha, I'd totally watch that.
<Dken2021> Dark92Enigma my little cousin said I needed one lol
<cachi01|MW3> mercys a penis!
<Gunthler> PEEEEEEEEEEEEEENISSSSSSSSSSSS
<sagas> Mercy's a penis!
<Gunthler> PPPEEEEEEEEEEEEENIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
<DrGNs> guy should get hearing aids
<Dken2021> THERE'S NO PONIES IN THIS DOJO!!
<pony_5299> pingas
<twilight_sprinkler> his Schwarznegger week reviews had me cramping up from laughs
<flutter_spin> Buytoast: I did watch some of his ramblings. He proves a point in most of the things he says, but it also very negative to some movies I watch "for fun"
<|Discord|> Tat costume
<sagas> skeleton costume?
<Dark92Enigma> Doug Walker is clearly playing a character, which intention is to entertain us and make us laugh
<Buytoast> Which of these is the better villain depending on my outlook on how I interpret a villain? Oh, this guy.
<Dken2021> ^
<Dken2021> grr
<Alister> Dark92Enigma: In that he fails
<CECtheRonin> Dark92Enigma Thank you.
<DuskStarshimmer> so much cursing
<dshannon> yeaaahhh!
<Dark92Enigma> and he's doing a hell of a job! GO NC!
<mitamaking> Seems like this entire review is, do you want fun or a well mad e movie
<SunderlandPony89> Curses are best words
<pony_5299> mercy's a penis was not funny
<FlareChaser> :O
<Tov|Calvinball> Doug hates 80s style bullies
<Darkts33> Lol
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: can we wtach some more NC reviews, like maybe Schwarznegger movie reviews?
<|Discord|> lol face
<sagas> haha mine bitches!
<DaringDude> YEEES
<geeky-brony> lol
<Cypresswolf> I kinda thought the kid in the remake was going to smash the trophy in front of Dre
<CECtheRonin> Nittany_Discord I'd actually vote for his review of Thomas and the Magic Railroad.
<Tov|Calvinball> I'm still waiting for Doug to review Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night.
<Buytoast> Point goes to new guy for being in China.
<Buytoast> Oh wow.
<Dark92Enigma> Old:1 New:2 NO SPOILERS
<|Discord|> Crazy Asian Kid
<Dken2021> his reviews aren't even considered reviews, it's just him making fun of the movie's stupidity and writing a script for it
<mitamaking> Supporting cast? In Karate Kid?
<twilight_sprinkler> Buytoast: youre kinda being unobjective too
<Bluestrom_S> this is a stupid video, why is he ranting about the two movies?
<sagas> not the mom... Should do the love intrest
<cachi01|MW3> Bluestrom_S: idk but its fun :D
<Buytoast> But I'm not plastering my asshole grin on the internet and smugly presenting my point.
<flutter_spin> Dken2021: pretty much. He does back up his bashings
<mitamaking> Bluestrom_S: He's not ranting on the movies
<Tov|Calvinball> He gives honest opinions at the very end of his reviews.
<CECtheRonin> Bluestrom_S He's not ranting.
<MahBoi777> bring in Chuck Norris
<twilight_sprinkler> Bluestrom_S: cuz its a comparison?.
<Calamity> That's what he does
<|Discord|> Bluestrom_S: He is the one who those kinds of things
<SunderlandPony89> Bluestrom_S: How is this a rant?
<Darkts33> HANG YO COAT
<Alister> Buytoast : I know ! Why review 20 year old movies ?
<Buytoast> Plus, I just love picking at these stupid opinionated "reviews".
<flutter_spin> Dken2021: I think his review of TMNT movie made me quit watching his videos
<Bluestrom_S> sorry not rant, but is he comparing them?
<sagas> stereotypical black woman
<pony_5299> who wants a MLP FiM movie? I do.
<twilight_sprinkler> Alister: "Nostalgia" Critic
<Bluestrom_S> they are very different
<Tov|Calvinball> Doug's review of Breaking Dawn was a rant.
<FlareChaser> :W
<Buytoast> I don't.
<Dken2021> these kids and their jackets
<SunderlandPony89> Reivews being opinionated? What a tweest!
<mitamaking> The Nostalgia Critic is a character, just like Angry Videogame Nerd
<flutter_spin> Yeah, I stopped watching him too :P
<pony_5299> in live action
<geeky-brony> lol
<Dken2021> you mean the bum review?
<sagas> Depends on how good the movie is
<SunderlandPony89> Because reviews TOTALLY are'nt based on opinions
<FlareChaser> Emo Asian :3
<pony_5299> directed by micheal bay.
<pony_5299> JK
<twilight_sprinkler> NC did a small bit about mlp G4
<Alister> twilight_sprinkler: In reality : Except the ''underrated'' classics reviews , a review of a 20 year old movie is pointless
<grovyleshy_wood> *shrug*
<Darf14> well at least hes intertaining
<Dark92Enigma> He also does reviews out of his Nostalgia Critic persona (As Doug Walker himself) where he gives his real opinion , and has a VERY MUCH CALMER attitude....except when he's taliking about the Twilight movies (at times)
<Dark92Enigma> Old:2 New:2
<Om> The plot
<FlareChaser> ...
<geeky-brony> yay story time
<grovyleshy_wood> Doug Walker is much calmer, but that Twilight review made me wanna hug him.
<Aircrafter> Neither Wins
<FlareChaser> wat
<Buytoast> I jsut really want to punch this guy in the face.
<Aircrafter> Cause they become friends :D
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> im back
<Dark92Enigma> STORY for the VICTORY
<Ponies47> Magic *snort* *snort*
<twilight_sprinkler> Alister: pointless for you maybe, others might enjoy old movies, he chose to reviews old movies, its his thing
<mitamaking> The story is probably going to go to the new one
<Bluestrom_S> play the altenative ending when the bad guy won in karate kid
<DuskStarshimmer> Flaw
<Saturn> 08,01looove's in blooom
<Ponies47> ^

<dshannon> gtfo grovle

<Marx> It's like calling a movie Troll 2 when it involves goblins. Wait...
<grovyleshy_wood> make me :D
<richfiles> Dat Brazil refernce! Baby Cakes music was from dat movie! :)
<Alister> twilight_sprinkler: look I don't wanna get in a debate about this guy
<dshannon> songs happen when songs happen
<dshannon> not when you want them
<Dark92Enigma> FUN FACT: THERE IS a Martial Art in Brazil: CAPOEIRA
<Aircrafter> Its like talking about shotguns, and it has nothing to do with america!
<Ponies47> LOVE is bloom! A beautiful sandvich! A handsome heavy weapons guy! :P
<grovyleshy_wood> Dark92Enigma: Capoeira is the inspiration for Hitmontop.
<twilight_sprinkler> elements of [control]
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Elements of Control
<Saturn> 08,01# love is in bloom / we know what they'll be up to soon / two hearts becoming one / presuming ropes can be undone #

<twilight_sprinkler> bless it
<alexxm> this was the best way end a season
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: Of course. Twilight wouldn't blindy do the wrong thing. But the background of the story IS a wedding. It's common for sisters to feel jealous. So it's understandable.
<Derpy_Hooves> :V
<Canadian_Brony> I'm back!

<hen3ry> do not use power tools when loaded.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: They just assume that Twilight was jealous. Based on her past actions, that's not too unbelievable. I mean, they were all working for Cadence after all.

<Canadian_Brony> CrazyCherry . . . I guess. I mean, we're all friends, amiright? I've been here for less than a week now
<hen3ry> time to grant an honorary PhD.
<TheMonstaMuffin> Ye
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: I agree. But there is only so much you can put in a 45 minute time slot. I'm sure we could have had an award ceremony for Twilight afterwards, but that would have taken too much time.
<Ghosties> 04Hello mish
<dshannon> I'm pretty sure Bronystate has a rule for something like that
<mario_pony> is that Borat?

<geeky-brony> Ghosties: rong not new metal not even metal stopid alternitv
<richfiles> Seapony Lyra! :)
<Darkts33> LYRA
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: I'm sensing that you only believe that Twilight deserves more than she is getting.
<CrazyCherry> 11:22.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Lyra! <3
<twilight_sprinkler> Ninjazz: from the technical perspective it makes sense, but when viewing them as characters without constraints they seem liek douches
<Ghosties> 04Because that's what this sounds like
<Aircrafter> I WAS RIGHT!
<DuskStarshimmer> ponies look deprssing under these filters
<Ghosties> 04Or at least the opening did
<mish> Lyra is swimming past the show

<richfiles> Cutiemarks DO NOT connect! :$
<mario_pony> i kind of like this
<geeky-brony> not metal at all
<VioletGreySha> Ghosties: it sounds like a cheap mashup of some guitar rifs
<Canadian_Brony> CrazyCherry I dunno. I've only talked to GilDash once, if memory serves correctly (which it usually doesn't)
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: How weren't they?

<DuskStarshimmer> hia lyra
<Spectrum_Rush> woo lyra
<twilight_sprinkler> Gaben version?
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkler: Yeah... Alright. At that point Twilight basically accused Cadence as being EVIL, which in Equestrian standards would be pretty harsh. Considering that Twilight has been showing signs of being jealous, they would be justified to a point. But ofcourse, the part EVERYONE putting Twilight down would probably be for dramatic reasons. Don't tell me that part with Celestia didn't hurt.
<MadSurge> Lyra was following :D :D

<Irish_Pony> alexxm: Sometimes I laugh so hard it makes my back hurt :P
<Drake> 04Any art/pixel art has to be of DrA dragons, even if you're simply using DrA dragons as mediums for your own characters - say, make a sprite of your character, who has a representation in a DrA dragon, and it won't be accepted.
<Drake> 04which is frustrating if you've already made it asdfghjkl

<Rain> trying to remember who Simple Plan is
<Canadian_Brony> it's a Canadian band. Montreal, to be exact
<Rain> thats very helpful :|
<Canadian_Brony> punk-rock-alternative, I think
*Rain shrugs, gives up, goes to do something else
<Carpathia> its a long vid but i reccomend it cause it shows how shit g3.5 was but in a hilarious way http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJnK_KS4G9k&feature=related
*Irish_Pony cleans his AK-47
<Rain> Carpathia: I, for one, enjoy all generations of MLP
<Rain> :|
<Carpathia> lol
<Carpathia> but... HOW CAN A HUMAN BEING WATCH G3.5... (love and tolerate... love and tolerate...)
<Rain> I absolutely hate that "Love and tolerate" bull
<Carpathia> rain calm down lol
<Rain> as if anyone who uses the line "love and tolerate" actually practice love and tolerance.
<Carpathia> i am tolerating
<Rain> the only people who say "love and tolerate" are trolls
<MadSurge> Carpathia: bile fascination? :D
<Carpathia> i could be insulting the shit out of you for watching that g3.5 crap
<Carpathia> but im not
<Carpathia> :\
<Bluestrom_S> good night everyone
<Rain> *scoffs* as if that is what it means to tolerate
<Carpathia> im tolerating your opinion...
<Carpathia> jesus, you're dumb
*Rain laughs
<Carpathia> im finding it harder and herder to tolerate you
<Carpathia> are you like 8?
<Rain> if you were someone who truelly tolerates things, you wouldnt even bring up the subject of how bad a show is
<Rain> and no, Im 20
<Irish_Pony> Love...hate...and tolerance.....
<Carpathia> lmao... i posted it just to have a laugh... cause... just... UGH god... if you don't like something you don't have to get all pissy over it
<Rain> exactly
<Carpathia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_1iKZGqvI&feature=related --- my reaction to g3.5
<hen3ry> bwahaha.
<Rain> Carpathia swings for the subject change and its a miss!
<Carpathia> Rain im not changing the subject... im still keeping it on the subject of me hating g3.5
<Carpathia> herp
<Hogia> 12hmm...
<Rain> hahaha
<Hogia> 12 98% through level 4
<Irish_Pony> My Little Pony = Absolutely terrible﻿ show. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic = BEST. SHOW. EVER.
<Hogia> 12it lied, he isn't ready
<Ascendant> lol dragon adopters
<Carpathia[uderp]> Irish_Pony so true
<Hogia> 12-_-
<dshannon> bwakakakakaka
<Carpathia[uderp]> also im irish :p
<Ascendant> I used to "play" that
<Ascendant> or really, use it
<Rain> I would have to dissagre. While FiM is a good show, I would have to say that Mushi-Shi is better.
<Ascendant> I prefer dragoncave
<Rain> what does you being irish have to do with anything? >_>
<Ghosties> 04I will say this right now
<Ghosties> 04G1
<Ghosties> 04Excellent pilot
<Rain> Thats like my brother pointing out people from his school and saying "btw, he is gay"
<Rain> its pointless information
<Rain> also, yes, Ghosties
<Irish_Pony> Rain: Because being Irish is freaking awsome?
<Carpathia[uderp]> ^
<Hogia> 12meh
<Carpathia[uderp]> seriously
<dshannon> dang right ghosties!
<Carpathia[uderp]> rain
<Carpathia[uderp]> you're an asshole
<Hogia> 12each to their own
<Rain> nah
<dshannon> nothing beats the demon ponies!
<Rain> Im just oppinionated
*Hogia 12eats another Skittle
<Carpathia[uderp]> an oppinionated prick
<Carpathia[uderp]> yeah
<dshannon> wait...
<dshannon> correction
<Rain> hahaha
<dshannon> nothing beats the demonic dragon ponies
<Rain> what happened to your "love and tolerate" crap? :D
<Carpathia[uderp]> out the window
<Carpathia[uderp]> it doesn't work on some people
<Rain> exactly
<Carpathia[uderp]> i.e
<Carpathia[uderp]> you
<dshannon> like you?
<Carpathia[uderp]> why should i tolerate an asshole?
<dshannon> as in you went out the window?
<Carpathia[uderp]> <---
<Carpathia[uderp]> uderp
<dshannon> bye bye!
<Ascendant> i never said there was anything wrong with dragon adopters, did I?
<Ascendant> I only expressed my opinion
<Ghosties> 04Because then you can't "love and tolerate" if you're not willing to do it all the time
<Rain> People who /say/ "love and tolerate" are easy to piss off. People who /live/ by such things as love and tolerance are hard to piss off, and would never say "love and tolerate"
<Ghosties> 04I mean hell
<hen3ry> seldom say it, not never
<Carpathia[uderp]> rain. rule 14. k, thx
<Ghosties> 04If you've been in the fandom as long as I have you begin to see that bronies stuff it down each other's mouths
*Ray goes to play touhou
<Ghosties> 04LOVE AND TOLERANCE LOVE AND TOLERANCE
<Rain> what Ghosties said
<Rain> rule 14? do refresh my memory as to what that is
<Ghosties> 04It was never even meant to be used like how must bronies these days use it ._.
<Rain> ^
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: Thats why my friend hates bronies :P
<Rain> ^
<Irish_Pony> Ghosties: But not me :$
<Ghosties> 04It was originally meant to be a counter trolling mechanism
<Rain> thats why I hate bronies
<Carpathia[uderp]> hate bronies...
*Carpathia[uderp] looks at channel name
<Carpathia[uderp]> herp
*dshannon grabs popcorn to watch the chat show
<Ghosties> 04You can be a fan of the show and dislike other bronies
<Rain> I happen to have good friends here, Carpathia[uderp]
<alexxm> how is it used today Ghosties the only bronies i talk to are here
<Rain> I like the show, and I like a few of the people here
<Vordox> I will love and tolerate everyone, except for the few, very very few exceptions. =3
<Rain> doesnt mean I like the rest of the fandom
<Ghosties> 04Oh Vordox
<dshannon> dang this is some great entertainment here! XD
<alexxm> which are Vordox
<Ghosties> 04In any case, "love and tolerance" is used like a mantra now
<Vordox> Only one person has made me so mad and disgusted that I avoid and completely forget them.
<alexxm> who was it Vordox
<Carpathia[uderp]> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tkQfxESnP1U/TtLQuV19nOI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/h1R4UVplqro/s1600/290-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic.png
<Carpathia[uderp]> xD
<Vordox> alexxm: None you should know.
<Hogia> 12I never said you said there was anything wrong with it
<alexxm> ok Vordox
<Rain> nobody has managed that for me yet, but I do have to laugh at my dad for how homophobic he is
*Hogia 12suddenly has toast
<dshannon> man I have never ever lived by those standards, mainly due to the fact its beyond human capabilities
<Drake> 04NS
<Vordox> I'm not using it as a mantra, I'm using it as an ideal.
<dshannon> it's
<Vordox> JUST LIK EJESUS
<Drake> 04it's been over 600 days since you last logged on
<Vordox> JESUS*
<Drake> 04now brb shower
<dshannon> :D
<Ghosties> 04But when does an ideal become trite
<Ghosties> 04When does it become mundane
<Ghosties> 04Something that people say to be accepted
<hen3ry> memetic mutation
<Carpathia[uderp]> Ghosties why do you use red in every message?
<Ghosties> 04I'm a mod :P
<Rain> when people stop being tolerant and start saying tolerate?
<hen3ry> mods type in color here.
<dshannon> because he's is god
<Carpathia[uderp]> i noticed...
<Carpathia[uderp]> but why lol
<Ascendant> it has?
<dshannon> darnit
<Ascendant> amazing
<Vordox> Ghosties: It's where people abuse it's right.
<Vordox> Simple
<dshannon> stupid english language
<Carpathia[uderp]> 09green is my fave colour
<Ghosties> 04Because I chose red initially when I came here and it just stuck
<Rain> Lawl
<Ghosties> 04Dat autokick
<Ghosties> 04He hasn't returned
<Rain> lolol
<Ghosties> 04Interdad
<dshannon> ride of the valkyries time?
<Ghosties> 04WAGNER, HELL YES
<dshannon> high five!
<Rain> anyway, tolerance is not something you just pick up by watching a show.
*Ghosties sends a virtual high five
<dshannon> damn right
<dshannon> XD
<Ghosties> 04Listen I have no problem if you picked up how to be a better person by the show
<Rain> ^
<Ghosties> 04My problem is when said person flaunts it
<Vordox> I'm not a brony, so I don't know :P
<Rain> that isnt being a better person
<Ghosties> 04When you force it onto others
<dshannon> man what's up with me tonight?...
<Rain> thats getting big headed
<Vordox> Just as I put Jesus as an ideal for myself, not the religion.
<dshannon> Am I on a sugar high?
<alexxm> possibly dshannon have some beer
<Hogia> 12whoa

<Hogia> 12When i stood up my whole leg prickled x_x
<Rain> "Having a religion is like having a penis. Its fine to have one, and its fine to be proud of it. Just dont try to ram it down my child's throat"
<Vordox> Ghosties: It's cause of that you bronies have succeed to get spread so fast.
<Rain> best quote ever
<dshannon> dat luna(r) astronaut
<hen3ry> ... dat mental image
<thegt90> i find it funny cus its dash goin through the earth

<Drake> 04oh ok

<TheRainbowDash> I don't think so....
<Ascendant> underneath the "I don't like you" picture
<Drake> 04just make a macro or something like Xeli said
<GilDash|EqD> Drunk is best way. :D
<alexxm> why not whats the worst that could happen
<TheRainbowDash> .....I still don't think so.
<Drake> 04I might ask him about that next time he's on
<Drake> 04and that invisible unicode or w/e
<Ascendant> oh lol those
<hen3ry> well, I'm wiped. Gonna crash
<TheRainbowDash> Umm, suspension, expulsion, to name a few consequences.
<TheRainbowDash> Bye hen3ry!
<alexxm> bye hen3ry
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: Gildy!
<Ascendant> it's based off
<hen3ry> adios, viya con carne
<DuskStarshimmer> TOM
<Drake> 04Because DrA refuses to allow the use of spaces in Dragon names
<Ascendant> er
<GilDash|EqD> Irish_Pony: You took your damned time to notice. ;)
<Lil_B> bye hen3ry
<Ascendant> that unicode is uh
<GilDash|EqD> Irish_Pony: How's those reaction times? :D
<Ascendant> !kyu
<TheRainbowDash> This is so weird, I have girl voice, but I am a bro, but I only use it for girly lyrics in songs.
<Ascendant> ohwaitnot on
<Drake> 04derp
<Ascendant> '
<Ascendant> those
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: Oh lets just me and CrazyCherry are..."Distracted" at the moment ;)
<Ascendant>
<Ascendant> U+0020
<GilDash|EqD> CrazyCherry: ...
<TheRainbowDash> Like the high pitched songs.
<TrixieMuffin> just propose movie time , if your teachers arent total dicks , they will agree !
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: I literally am incapable of high pitch. :D
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: Well she went AFK for a moment :P
<Drake> 04erm
<Drake> 04what
<DuskStarshimmer> Tom is best pony you guys.
<GilDash|EqD> Irish_Pony: ... And why have I not been invited? :(
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: Yeah, singing Equestrian Girls, and wow, I can somehow, somhow, hit those notes.:D
<Drake> 04NS when I said I was going to ask him I also meant I was going to ask him what it is
<alexxm> hey DuskStarshimmer hows your day been
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: I have to sing it an entire octave lower. :D
<DuskStarshimmer> alexxm, Well I need to sleep, that has been my whole day
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, like my vice clears up more, and then, a girl voice comes out.
<Ascendant> Ah
<TheRainbowDash> ...somehow, I manage to pull this off.
*DuskStarshimmer passes out
<Ascendant> well a macro is just a repeater sort of thing
<TheRainbowDash> *voice
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: Oh come one were almost to the good part...here *pushes alexxm over to her* take him and do something with him
<Ascendant> it's a set of instructions
<Ascendant> that gets repeated
<Ascendant> go google it
<Irish_Pony> *on
<alexxm> wait what Irish_Pony
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: I can usally add a "gravelly" tone to it. Going full metal, like Dave Mustaine or something, I can usally hold out for one song, but then my voice begins to go. :D
<Drake> 04I sorta/kinda already knew what a macro is, but thanks.
<Ascendant> and what I pasted there was the space unicode thingy
<Drake> 04well let's see if it works
<GilDash|EqD> Irish_Pony: But I've misses CrazyCherry for so long... :(
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: Yeah, I can sing that also. ...from metal to....modern pop girl music.:D
<Drake> 04if not, 3 dragon coins agone!
<TheRainbowDash> Or dance music, whatever.
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: Nope. Metal or rock for me. :D
<Drake> 04GODDAMNIT
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: We'll figure something out ;)
*alexxm hugs GilDash|WqD
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: Anyone can sing dance though. Just need autotunes. :D
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: No, just explaining the eifferences in genres....in which I can sing.
*alexxm hugs GilDash|EqD
*GilDash|EqD hugs alexxm.
<Ascendant> o-O?
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: Like the Equestrian Girls song? Eh...
<Ascendant> noooooo all my dragcave dragons got unnamed
<Ascendant> and I should
<Ascendant> really do my work
<Ascendant> fml
<Drake> 04go do eet
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: Well, I can try to sing to almost anything, it just ends up sounding metal. :D Like This Day Aria... sounds really weird when I sing it. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Like I can hit that super high note that Twilight sings in the song Winter Wrap Up also.
<TheRainbowDash> :)
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: Ah, Thsi Day Aria, I can sing, somehow, somehow, good....
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: I can sing Winter Wrap up an entire octave lower and hit the low notes... That's the only way to hit that Twilight note without my voice fucking up. :D
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha, sucks for you.:D
<Drake> 04NS your entire TST profile can be summed up as "I hate you, don't annoy me, and I might hate you less."
<CrazyCherry> GilDash|EqD: GilDy!!! Oh I missed you so much!!!
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|EqD: Guess whos back....
*CrazyCherry hugs GilDash|EqD tightly.
<GilDash|EqD> CrazyCherry: You left me waiting... :'(
<Ascendant> that's cus it's what it is
<Angel_Espeon> 13> tsundere
<TheRainbowDash> Like I can the colt and mare (original) version of This Day Aria...quite well.
<Drake> 04ohlol
<CrazyCherry> GilDash|EqD: I'm so sorry I did that... I really am! :'(
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: My voice is crap. Usually I can hit the notes, but my voice always sounds terrible anyway. :D
<Ascendant> http://www.lugia.us/forum/community-hangout/tst-members-you%27d-like-to-meet-someday/msg294565/#msg294565
<Ascendant> I lol'd
<Ascendant> i want to meet my brother one day

<TheRainbowDash> Oh god....

<Irish_Pony> I like where this is going :$
<CrazyCherry> GilDash|EqD: Yes, anything you want, just tell me.
<Drake> 04goddamnit they got rid of the Tsundere t-shirt
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash, Irish_Pony: I started talking. It was only ever going to go one way. :D
<Drake> 04http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1525
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash|EqD: Yeah...that direction.:D
<TheRainbowDash> Typical.
<Drake> 04NS should wear the t-shirt in the last panel

*alexxm hugs CrazyCherry
<Irish_Pony> Ok now I really like where this is going.......
<Ascendant> hurr
*CrazyCherry hugs alexxm back.
<TheRainbowDash> Uh-oh...that awkward when GilDash|EqD and CrazyCherry and talking like thui-oh wait, just typical talk between the two.:D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, i-it's not like she l-likes that shirt or anything...
<Angel_Espeon> 13<<
<Angel_Espeon> 13>>
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I think NS lacks the "dere" part of Tsundere
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: If I'm talking it's nearly always awkward, if not for the person I'm talking to then everypony else on the chat. :D
<Rain> Raise your hand if you dislike the newer generations of pokemon and only like the first or second generation
<TheRainbowDash> I see....
<Angel_Espeon> 13Apparently I'm one too, except more on the dere side
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<TheRainbowDash> Rain: I concur.
<Rain> then you sir, are not a pokemon fan
<TheRainbowDash> What?

<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VovLJcaKMYE AJ<3
<TheRainbowDash> Ohyeah, because that was way more memorable in my childhood than of this, newer generation stuff.
<GilDash|EqD> Rain: I don't have a particularly favourite generation as much as favourite pokémon from each.
<Ascendant> cus' Drake knows these things for a living
<Angel_Espeon> 13I love you all so much and if anyone does anything to hurt you I'll cut them up and feed their limbs to you <3
<Ascendant> also I've grown into a sarcasm incarnate I swear
<Drake> 04NS I said that last night
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: That Applejack, I don't see Rocky nearby, so why is she training?
<Ascendant> Drake the Hensh is rubbing off on me more than I thought
<Ascendant> ):
<Drake> 04stop stealing my lines :(
<Ascendant> you did?
<Ascendant> I wasn't reading
<Vordox> TheRainbowDash: It's based from None Piece 4
<Rain> the newer generation pokemon is the same stuff that you grew up with. the only difference is you
<Rain> you grew up
<Hogia> 12O_o
<TheRainbowDash> Vordox: Oh, derp....
<Rain> and it is now childish to you

<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't accept random requests either LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13but somehow I have people in this list who I don't recognise/remember
<Drake> 04hmm

<Ascendant> I replied with the same meme
<GilDash|EqD> TheRainbowDash: That's why I sing on octave lower then most. I can get super low notes that make people go, "Whoa..."

<|Discord|> alexxm: I just woke up but it has been good so far
<|Discord|> Tat was on of the best games ever
<sub06905> i still havent beat dead island :$
<Resonantwaves> BAKA O_O
<MadSurge> Any sad music for me is undermined if the game it comes from is terrible :D
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4miwh7 MadSurge, not a game, but just beautiful.
<Drake> 04back
<Spell-of-Gaming> Mother 3 was a pretty depressing game. :P
<LightTrooper105> wops o3o
<|Discord|> My little dashie was the only book that EVA made me cry. EVA
<XAX> Spell-of-Gaming: I heard. I might play it some time.
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4vfvcr I would freak out if I saw Dashie in my bed.o_o

<XAX> |Discord|: >book

<XAX> i cried a little too
<alexxm> how come TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Shw always got that, look of hers.
<MadSurge> I may be the only guy in the universe that thought Mother 3's story was terrible -__-
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> MadSurge: May you explain? :P
<alexxm> MadSurge haven't played it so i can't say
<sub06905> never played mother 3 6_9
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4yvet6 Best gift ever, ship that to me, now.:D
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: SOOOOOCKKS http://derpy.me/MLpNf
<TheRainbowDash> Mother 3? Never heard of it.
<TheRainbowDash> XAX: Rainbow socks now, amazing.
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash she looks pissed
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Yeah, that's the problem.
<Renard> http://dm29.deviantart.com/art/Bubbles-in-the-Tub-305612011
<XAX> TheRainbowDash: I legitimately want a pair of rainbow socks. That would be amazing.
<Ascendant> wb Drake
<Drake> 04thanks
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: I'm not against character deaths, but it happens so early you don't feel anything for those blank characters :/
<XAX> walkin round in a pair of rainbow socks with not a care in the world

<alexxm> Renard what
<Drake> 04surprisingly*
<Spell-of-Gaming> MadSurge: TBH, I was a bit disappointed on the story too. Hinawa was practically a plot device.
<Drake> 04ohgod

<LightTrooper105> well im going to make dinner and wipe my tear so be right back
<XAX> D:
<TheRainbowDash> sub06905: Wingboners Rainbow Dash? Eh, not surprised.
<|Discord|> TheRainbowDash: I can't put up a pony background until my parents know I am a brony.
<MadSurge> Spell-of-Gaming: exactly. Same for the brother. At least it was a pretty good RPG.
<TheRainbowDash> |Discord|: They don't know yet? How long have you been a brony?
<|Discord|> TheRainbowDash: A month or two
<sub06905> i watch MLP on my tv no one cares :)
<XAX> LightTrooper105: I actually decided to look at the Torchlight II store page today, and i saw that this one is gonna be multiplayer :o We should play a little when it comes out.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Tanetane Island on Mother 3 was one hell of a drug.
<TheRainbowDash> |Discord|: Ah, okay. I've been a brony for almost 3 months now, and they knew at around 1 week into my introduction to the fandom.
<alexxm> i use youtube and bronystate to watch ponies
<LightTrooper105> XAX indeed back to cooking!
<Oni_Link> im a closet brony -.-
<MadSurge> TheRainbowDash: ever heard of Earthbound? Mother 3 is the japan only sequel.
<alexxm> Oni_Link come out
<|Discord|> TheRainbowDash: I am a master of hiding things. It is to be the "other" things I was afraid my mom would find but now it is justy ponies so I don't care.
<TheRainbowDash> MadSurge: ...never heard of Earth Bound either.
<XAX> I never admit it to people that i'm a brony, but I never deny it when asked.
<Oni_Link> im scared...
<XAX> If someone asks, i say yes.
<sub06905> still need to finish downloading the rest of season 2 0-0
<TheRainbowDash> |Discord|: Okay then, whatever you want to do, fine by me.
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash ness from smash bros is from earthbound
<|Discord|> EarthBound...ma gawd talk about a fucked up game with some crazy bosses
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Really? Never knew that.
<MadSurge> TheRainbowDash: it's a pretty whacky RPG for the SNES
<XAX> I can't say no if someone asks if i'm a brony anyway. I have Pinkie clipped to my school bag, and i wear Rainbow Dash headphones pretty much wherever i go :l
<TheRainbowDash> Ah, out of my generation league, wasn't born into the SNES age.
<|Discord|> MadSurge: Especially that one boss...what was his name, the one at the end?
<MadSurge> Gyigas
<alexxm> i don't really do anything to say this guy is a brony in public
<pipsqueakthepirate> hello
<|Discord|> MadSurge: Yup
<sub06905> XAX: where you get those RD headphones?
<alexxm> hey pipsqueakthepirate hows your day been
<Spell-of-Gaming> If Mother 3 was a fanfic, it would have made it deeper in to the "Slice Of Life" Genre.
<|Discord|> pipsqueakthepirate: Hai
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4nuzgq Again, would freak out.
<pipsqueakthepirate> ust woke up:P
<XAX> MadSurge: I heard the bossfight with Giygas is... interesting.
<MadSurge> XAX: I have only a SHED.MOV shirt, and I like trolling people to guess what it's from :D
<alexxm> what does the shirt say MadSurge
<MadSurge> XAX: it's very mind screw like.
<MadSurge> alexxm: it's decorative toaster cozy Derpy with "hey hey hey, stay outta my shed" written around it
<XAX> sub06905: google search "phillips design your own headphones". They're a set of headphones that you can put any picture in the side of. Here's my pair: http://derpy.me/bCwX8
<alexxm> right thanks MadSurge
<TheRainbowDash> http://fav.me/d4o0dlg Hahaha, Dashie, why you jealoud?:D
<TheRainbowDash> *jealous
<XAX> I did change the picture in them though (the background behind RD's cutie mark is RD's coat color instead of black now."
<MadSurge> The "crush kill destroy swag" shirt is pretty good too :$
<sub06905> XAX: they make headphones 20% cooler
<XAX> sub06905: :3
<XAX> NINJAZZ
<XAX> WELCOME BACK BRAH
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder if Earthbound 64 was any deeper in the development stage... There's a picture where a Pigmask hangs himself. I kinda found that disturbing.
<Ninjazz> Here's a very important life lesson. Wash your dishes BEFORE they smell like spoiled milk.
<Ninjazz> Hey XAX!
*Ninjazz hugs XAX
<alexxm> hey Ninjazz hows your day been

<Chimera> I have to take the SATs.
<Chimera> God no ;-;
*XAX has no creativity when it comes to maze design...
<MadSurge> Yeah but Soarin' is MALE, TheRainbowDash :D
*Hogia 12pounces on Espeon
*Chimera pounces as well
<TheRainbowDash> MadSurge: Yeah, but look at the pony internet again about Dashie shipping, and report back to me of your findings.:D
<Ninjazz> 35 minutes into chapter 5, XAX. So far so good.
<XAX> Ninjazz: :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Dishes dirty? To the... dishwasher. :D

<Spell-of-Gaming> Just get inspiration from a QR code to make a maze. :P
<Ninjazz> How you been?
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I know what this calls for....wubwubwub.
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash wait someone made a sequal to my little dashie
<Oni_Link> Am I the only one who wasn't old enough to watch Saint Seiya/ Knights of the Zodiac and enjoy it wayyy later on in their life?
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: I prefer mosh, mosh, mosh. :D
<Drake> 04Espeon~
<MadSurge> TheRainbowDash: not a chance, I'm against pony shipping :D
*Drake just hugs
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Nope, Dubstep Wubwasher.:D
<Ninjazz> And I don't got one of those weird machines your talking about. I got to do the dirty work myself. :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You're missing out on so much. :D
<MadSurge> Hey GilDash!

<GilDash> Ninjazz: Don't worry, I was at uni once. I know exactly what it's like to clean dishes. :D
<Ninjazz> So far, XAX... Chapter is very well done.

<MadSurge> TheRainbowDash: I'm just not fond of crack pairing :P
<alexxm> TheRainbowDash wait someone made a sequal to my little dashie
<Chimera> Me espy or both

<TheRainbowDash> MadSurge: Ugh found FlutterDash stuff.:D
<XAX> Ninjazz: As far as my reading goes, or the writing of the story?
<Ninjazz> XAX: Reading, good. Chapter, exceptional.

<Ninjazz> Italians don't even like Italics.
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: Ah, just thought of that....too late now.
*Oni_Link rides away on derpy doing loops

<doughnutjoe> Twi_Fi: Then whats with the :O face?
<sub06905> lol
<bartsonic> life could use more pinkie pie
<Oni_Link> navi is cute but she can get annoying quick
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: If it's indicative of any activity then the ghost is either weak or not interested in psychological manipulation.
<alexxm> what are you talking about Twi_Fi
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: But I was excited about any activity at all.
<doughnutjoe> Twi_FI Then why did the ghost go pedo and breath on my face
<Capn_Gavn> ?
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: Ah, that could be construed as psychological manipulation.
<Ninjazz> I was just handed this... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YtwPPsBKGQ
<|Discord|> My little sister wants to watch me play Diablo 3. Should I?
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: .....what the hay is this...:D

<Ninjazz> Will do, Dashie.
<TheRainbowDash> And oh my...that plot.
<Ninjazz> :$
<TheRainbowDash> Just try to minimilize the use of that word.
<Oni_Link> how old is she discord?
<doughnutjoe> mid 30's
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: A means to inspire fear or doubt in you so as to gain some mental control over you.
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: Not complete mental control.
<doughnutjoe> Well it made me cold
<doughnutjoe> Thats it
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: The goal would be to get a reaction.
<Oni_Link> id freak out if pinkie popped out of my monitor too lol
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: Which is what I mean by psychological manipulation.
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: It may want you to play its game, so to speak.
<doughnutjoe> Well it made me get a blanket -_-
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: We are talking about the supernatural!
<GilDash> Twi_Fi: Manipluation. Hmm, I ply that ocassionally. :D
<alexxm> did you two actully interact with a ghost Twi_Fi
<doughnutjoe> idk if i did
<doughnutjoe> Not sure if ghost....Or just wind
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: See, it inspired you to act in a predetermined way.
<TheRainbowDash> doughnutjoe: Just the wind.
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: muahahahahahahaha
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: No, sadly.
<Oni_Link> damn nature you scary
<GilDash> doughnutjoe: Wind. =_(\
<doughnutjoe> Twi_Fi MY cheeks were EXTREMLEY cold though
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: That face.
<Twi_Fi> alexxm: I did have a mild experience that made me think there was a ghost.
<DocSane> Pinkie Pie in real life would be super annoying.

*sergio_scriptor waves back at RaveBrony :)
<Oni_Link> 8 bit winter wrap up :)
<Twi_Fi> doughnutjoe: But yeah, it is difficult to say what could be the cause, so it's either something weak or peaceful, in those cases nothing to worry about, or it can be explained naturally, which again there would be nothing to worry about.
<Oni_Link> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKuV8XAx78&feature=relmfu
<alexxm> hey RaveBrony hows your day been

<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure I gave you that to read before
<GilDash> Twi_Fi: CrazyCherry's as bad as me, just more subtle. :D
<Twi_Fi> Anything?
<Ascendant> but damn... I just read it again and it's good
<Twi_Fi> O_O
<Ascendant> and very sad
<Drake> 04Yes you have
<Drake> 04And I agree
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Oh, she has, has she? ;)
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, nything.
<TheRainbowDash> *anything
<Ascendant> it's wonderfully written

<Drake> 04That one where Robin goes megalomaniac?
<Ascendant> Yeah
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: I am the worst of you all.:D
<Ascendant> and Slade is the hero for once
<Drake> 04ayup
<Drake> 04I loved that one
<Ascendant> it's twisted
<Ascendant> since it's pretty much the reverse of the actual happenings
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: Debatable. :p
<Ascendant> but... it's amazing
<Renard> http://i.imgur.com/3tYEp.png
<TheRainbowDash> What?

<Ninjazz> GilDash: Well... Have full with that. :$
<Twi_Fi> Renard: WTF!
<Drake> 04I agree
<Ascendant> it's hard to get all the emotional stuff to add up, like trauma
<Drake> 04I thoroughly enjoyed it
<Ascendant> I think trauma is one of the hardest things to write
<Drake> 04Even though it made me baaaaw
<Ascendant> since you have to thoroughly understand it
<Ascendant> to show the "progress" and everything
<Ascendant> yeah
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: My reaction also.
<Ascendant> I love that story
<Ninjazz> Fuck, Renard... It's becoming a god damn meme...
