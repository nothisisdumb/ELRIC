spidermare
i bet its derpy
It looks like Rarity kinda.
Mare do Well Rarity?
and no its not mare do well
o wait
it might be rarity
Maybe a power ranger
it makes more sense to do a rarity
ITS A PUMBLOOM
Cause Rarity is underappreciated.
I'm listening
:)
same here
hi
Rarity is best pony
rarity is second best mule :)
Now how is he gonna fit the mane in?
*hugs Wrek*
is a movie
wht is this shitty music
Rarity is sexiest pony
^nope
But her personality is her best trait, like all the mane6
would it be worth it to by Heartfire or Dawnguard with Skyrim?
Complaining about the music? That's a paddlin'
mexicans only make peruan flute music
^
Sombrero likes mexican metal
Rarity isn't sexist pony
Maybe best whore
And ponies can still kick I think
But that's about it
She's only a whore in the fanfics
stahp dahpi!
You should read Like Fine Wine
Everyone
I get a homosexuality vibe from Rarity
awwww shit son /me takes out lighter
/me takes out lighter

Let's face it, Rarity is more into mares than RD is

Edible boots

milieu symbols
Nudity isn't taboo in Equestria
Things got awkward
Clothes are a luxury in Equestria
Only rich ponies wear clothes
^
Edible boobs
It's teats
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
All boobs are edible, it's just that few people like canabalism
Ponies don't have 'boobs'
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits
05oo this is a good song
Hi :P

Or half of the mares are actually drag queens.

all the males are in the military. must be a young agg draft in equestria
age*
with at least 5% meat
man these songs are loooooooong
Hier öffnen!
How is it possible to be a drag queen with no clothes 6.9
There were soooo many Lyras and Bonbons in the crowd last episode
I would like some milk from the milkmans wifes tits

Tanks? WHen did this happen?

And bullets

they talked about tanks twice
Ahem, "He'll need to go fast as a bullet to keep up with me!"
Emergency Edible Boots. Discuss
They mention the word tank, not acctual tanks
Gasoline: we arnt compleatly sure yet
Okay
NO WAY :O
seems to be a horse
i'm pretty sure they were talking about the war machines
maybe a goat
not sure yet
My little gelding, castration is magic
horse pun
Nothing else would make sense in context
o ya

The regulations and duties applied in St-Pierre and Miquelon are not the same as those applied in the EU. For one thing, there is no VAT."

"hack"
according to the mods it wasnt a hack
hafta?
05there was no hack
hijack
The mods are just trying to deny it
The PR department has spoken, There was no 'hack'
... =__=
05this "hijack" has happened many times before we use it when we switch streamers
05not even the stream was hacked
Either way, we were invaded
05yes
Well, it's hardly a hack.
Hijacked, my friends. Not hacked.
05calling it a hack gives the guys behind it waaaay too much credit
^
It does
And it wasn't all that epic, ergo they don't merit the credit
taking*
Socks: but it wasn't epic:D
nice poster
can we get a clearer view of the pin up poster
Oh, and by the way some boobs in the background, just to remind you this is an anime.

05im driving
05adn they tried to grab the steering wheel

Hacking requires skill
Gasoline: yep

Misunderstandings, can we?
english has the worst version imo
It didn't even have a song ;-;
11,02Part of the reason I'm upset is that I drew a picture and they deleted it because of the quote.

13?
13oh
00,10sucks they would do that
11,02They did, but their censorship sucks.
11,02It's even worse than censoring the Sopranos on cable TV
11,02I'll show you the message I posted that they deleted.
13FUN IS MANDATORY
aw come on!!!!!!!
those pics are great and they were already censored

11,02Take a look at these messages that I'm allowed to send to them
I got kicked from brawl's online services for that on an older console
because of the taunt messages
11,02I would like them to explain to me what's wrong with the message I posted.

I know, I have had a few experiences, two with typos.
That's in the picture I put up.

Did anyone actually look at that picture? I just experienced that.

11,02JRP2234: They just said it violated the Miiverse Code of Conduct.
very unfair
Be right back... and yes, I could leave my system unattended. My brother is at school camp for 2 weeks.
My other brother respects my privacy, and my little sister doesn't know how to type.

how many zombies are there with me? xD
00,10hmmmm the panic button on the mechJeb seems to be the blow shit up button

wait, the gamepad has an AC adapter?
11,02Yeah

/me needs a dispenser in this very spot
Try not to go overboard on the /me though
Extreme RP is bannable.
Just kiddin'
But seriously, it is a pretty cool function.
I do
hmmmmm

/me puts on his coolface
yup
i can putting tinsel up
Now when are you guys gonna do something with Hearth's Warming Eve?
we are
gyrobowl is the topper
^
In Australia, we just decorate our native Norfolk Pines. THey grow up to 35m (around 110 feet) high. Always fun to decorate.
the base is but
need to be put together
derpy ornament and dash ornament
it is?
/me snuggles her zelda blanket
me too , I have a triforce wallet, I want a link plushie though
lets see.. marissa asks me if i watch the episode on saturday
that count?
pony spin(vinyl on record) my freind likes that one
haha wow
least vanessa dont play g3..
she plays g1 sometimes..
sea ponies shoo be doo
The first G1 promo was Okay, I guess.
The second one still was barely watchable, but not too bad.
The third one and all of the G1 from there on, in my opinion, stunk.
But really, how could someone actually mindlessly sit at a screen and enjoy something that had little effort put into it, and was a marketing scheme for 3 - 5 year old girls? The first two episodes of G1 didn't stink too bad, but from there on, I didn't like it. G2 was quite interesting, with the urban setting, but still sucked in my opinion. No offence to those whose childhood consisted of mainly this. With G3, I don'
I thought there was no G2
aw :<
wow
G2 existed, but it wasn't anything special. Just like G1 ponies, except in a retro-urban setting, with houses, tvs, radios, gyms, shops... everything a little girl would enjoy, but not us.
This is stupid.
youre on "Off the Air"
Beep boop.

Finally, an RD gallery without that... shot... that /mlp/ likes from S2E07... *shrugs at the thought of it*
I don't want to --- i-s-d- r------ ----
11,02What browser are you using?
I like this picture of her, but /mlp/ ruined it. I thought it was a good picture before it was defiled in such a manner. http://archive.heinessen.com/boards/mlp/thumb/0042/18/1346300462472s.jpg is the picture, putting aside the meme that got attached to it, do YOU think it's a good picture? Reminds me of a cat.
11,02How bout now?
now I got it!
11,02Sweet :)
Groovy
Yup
BO2 is up.
dat emblem :3
Same. /mlp/ tied a disturbing meme to that picture I just put up. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-to-cum-inside-rainbow-dash here's the meme if you are curious, but it has iffy content.
careful now
Yup... cannot unsee
You should probably investigate further into ways to prevent chatroom guests from mentioning that g-word. They can just say g a k, or say g - a - k. If I get a paddlin' I would know that you guys are responsible, and have it under control.
No? Should probably get that fixed. An easy way for offenders to say that.
well yeah i think its meant as an anti-flood mechanism
thats it really
I can run MW2 and MW3 but I kinda don't like those games
11,02crud

Another thing I complain about

Actually, I like it.

well then he could've changed at the bathrooms there
he's already clamoring fora ttention there, why does he need to do it everywhere along the way
and u just jelly cause you cant do good cosplay
the only time for dressing up is for either a prade or halloween
some should cosplay as g-k
or if you're doing something illegal i suppose
or conventions
or for fun
now you don't need to do it for ceonventions
you can if you want to
but then you keep it there
its always a good time whoa o oh
i dropped my phone in the pool again D:
boom diiaada boom diaada boom diaada boom diaada

not insulting them all
they wanna wear it when they're there fine
speaking of ponies..
but you go onto a train or some shit and start acting like the character there
well you're just disgraceful
how is that?
you wouldnt be saying that if it was like deadpool or something
^
/me is obsessed with jelly.
oh no, he has an opinion! I know I'll insult him! that'll show him!

/me quits RP
Bullshit, you were insulting him.
No shit.
YEA
well see, now you tell me this after the fact
doesn't change anything, except that now it's jsut a personal vendetta for you
and that you're just an asshole
^
/me is waiting for someone to comment, "Well that escalated quickly!"but then realises that joke was old 2 weeks ago.
everyone knows i'm an asshole
if it was some hot chick doing the same thing then yes
BIAS

/me NEEDS A DISPENSER HERE!!!

you were a bit ago mate
were you on a bus or a train?
cause i don't know of many trains with cushiony seats
:3 That's enough of that....I think my brother heard that one :D
Calling me 'Emo McPissfaggot' is hardly going to get me to think you're a paragon of virtue and goodwill.
i don't care
looked like one of those luxary shuttle things
Hardly, most underground trains smell like piss and boozy vomit.
well yeah
we dont even have subways
MURIKA
I dunno about trains in MURICA, guessing they have plastic seats then?
the ones i ride do
heck we dont even have quality buses here
/me clings onto someone
damn
dont make me go to work ;_;
Shiiieett
nuuu
only thing i rode on with cushiony seats was that one shuttle to that comic con thing back in march or some shit
now that was comfy
Although they really aren't as comfortable as they look, seeing as they tend to have chewing gum stuck to every seat.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
damn man, don't dissipate my illusions of granduer
