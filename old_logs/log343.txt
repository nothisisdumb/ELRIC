<Dtox> wow this show is just one big acid trip lol
<Plotbuster> nn
<Tenure> It got too close to the NRA compound
<Tao-mell> that's like saying ALL American cartoons suck
<otakon> RAWRity: too disturbing for PG13 chat
<RainbowKitten> Wait... They use our names of currency, yet different looks.... Seems legit.
<Ponyfan78> Is that dude a fox?
<TOY_PON3> :)
<AnonyPony-EQD> Tao,
<stallion10123> shhhhhh
<MasterBrony> can you tell the streamer to change it?
<Alister> I admit SOME anime is kinda good
<firlalaith> think so
<otakon> seriously though
<metalpinkiepiechan> MahBoi777: :)
<AnonyPony-EQD> Many of our cartoons suck.
<MisterTwister> originally
<Tenure> I can't tell if fox or rat
<TopHat> exactly
<SHOKERBRONY> just 2 months
<Colt_of_Personality> saying Anime sucks in general is like saying "Live action movies suck in general"
<emangamer> hey does anypony know where that deviant picture of Vi is?
<Alister> but most of it is garbage
<MuffinHooves> Don't expect this show to make much sense
<TOY_PON3> plus it gives Fluttershy a HORRIBLE name
<DocSane> He's supposed to be a fox.
<That_One_Guy> That voice!
<RAWRity> otakon: clearly you people have not seen the crap they get away with in PG-13 movies lately.
<ROBCakeran53> DENIED
<stallion10123> !
<That_One_Guy> My ears!
<Tao-mell> I agree, most of it is
<DocSane> They dub him as a rat.
<otakon> Lucille has HORNS and is supposed to be a female sheep
<stallion10123> !
<MasterBrony> this show makes me :[
<redWHOTOOKMYNAME> hi everyone

<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777
<Tierson> lol she's gonna "buck" tonight
<Alister> and i was a weaboo before
<stallion10123> ho u
<SteamingBullet> That's because america only chooses to translate most of the crappy ones
<Ponyfan78> Or is he the mythical fox creature
<TOY_PON3> ^
<TopHat> I don't watch anime, but I don't hate on it eaither
<Tao-mell> like Princess Tutu, or Code Geass
<firlalaith> there are female sheep out there with horns
<metalpinkiepiechan> MahBoi777
<Sus> Oh Japan.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it's the streamer's choice, and once she starts a show she finishes it, though she may change to a different series after each episode

<redWHOTOOKMYNAME> what is this?
<Alister> Why does this cat remind me of Spongebob with his voice ?
*TOY_PON3 is horrible

<QuakerAssassin> jump out a window
<MasterBrony> how do i become a streamer?
<FreedomChannel> ok how much longer do we have to wait?

<Valistar> and they fight crime all over town
<Alister> Humanity*
<SHOKERBRONY> and all of that stuff
<K_A> Samurai aren't ninjas, though.
<Valistar> Dont forget that.

<Ponyfan78> god that dog face
<Tao-mell> humanity is sick pretty much all the time
<Alister> most of the time actually
<richfiles> ^^ sums it up perfectly, actually
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pepperoni + mushrooms = awesome pizza

<TOY_PON3> SaxyPretender: I'm boring I only like pepperoni
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and since a few of you guys are new, make sure you read up on the rules so you don't get yourselves into any trouble, www.bronystate.net/rules
<TOY_PON3> xD
<Tao-mell> that's why we have MLP to make us less sick

<appajak> little people
<RAWRity> Ponyfan78: team rocket
<magicman> Its official, this show officially killed the fourth wall
<MisterTwister> you missed :D
<Ponyfan78> I see this series has no regards for the 4th wall
<richfiles> Twilight goes psycho... Makes me feel normal
<RainbowKitten> The humor in this show is barley noticable...
<richfiles> :$
<Tao-mell> there's a lot of pervert bronies
<emangamer> Luna: is this....could this be? the SAMURAI PIZZA CATS???!?
<ncb_LuckyStampede> J eat garlic every day. Probably why people don't talk to me.
<MasterBrony> in reading the rules
<fredfred99> This is so bad it's good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heh, all I know of New Haven is the Metro-North station
<firlalaith> umbrella....xD
<Alister> Don't talk about ''those ones''
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> LOL
<B0X0R> what fourth wall
<ROBCakeran53> Looks like Pinkie Pie has some competition.
<Plotbuster> wow, just kill those birds like nothiong

<QuakerAssassin> so umbrella > sword?
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> YEA!
<metalpinkiepiechan> HEART ATTACK
<MasterBrony> are youtube links ok?
<DocSane> New Haven = Best pizza in the USA
<Colt_Magnum> mistertwister, i dont think u understand what you just admitted to.
<KaeBrony> da faq

<pony_8062> HAHAHA omg
<JoachimR> what?
<RAWRity> The Hunger Games: intrigued/hopeful it'll be good, but the casting leaves me less than enthused. Snow White and the Huntsman: interested in seeing Kristen Stewart in a role that's not horribly written, and Charlize Theron looks like a blast to watch.
<pony_8062> this is priceliss
<Tao-mell> yikes

<ncb_LuckyStampede> sorry I missed that
<TheWattsMan> no, you're going to let me escape because you're too busy monologuing
<RAWRity> Colt_Magnum: seeing as half the movies made these days are book-movie tie-ins, I don't think that really holds ground.

<Bronyberg> Thanks Kaebrony
<XaviortheSavior> You know, we don't have any solid proof that hasbro took down the derpy episode because it was offensive. According to a video I saw, it's nothing more than a rumor.
<NewCalamity> yep
<IshBestPony> what controversy?
<TheWattsMan> monetary units
<KetaminaDianePie> and here we go again
<K_A> I'd be legitimately saddened if they phased out or altered Derpy.

<ScootaChicken> o;
<K_A> And I'll leave it at that.
<MisterTwister> One that might or might not be real.

<PaperDerp> classic is still best to me, never left the series
<Dr_Cheesums> the tree part i found offencive
<herostar> don cry i support your decision
<KetaminaDianePie> oooowwwwww yeeeeeah
*Phase4 absolutly hated this game with reason
<Dr_Cheesums> not sure why
<PaperDerp> why hated?
<SpaceCore> Why not play Sonic '06? Sonic 06 is awesome. :D
<tisaname> ... are you a sentient tree?
<herostar> i wish i had this game! i'd pay 50 right off the bat!
<Millsbuddy> Bump
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> TFACEPLANT
*SpaceCore hates the game but loved Sonic'06.
<Millsbuddy> Bump
<Millsbuddy> Bump'
<MahBoi777> sonic is all about speed, not stretchy werewolf arms
<Dr_Cheesums> what is this sentient you speak off
<Phase4> PaperDerp, horrible controls, story, voices, cheap deaths, bad level design
<SpaceCore> &
<Phase4> PaperDerp, and 'warehog'? srsly?
<tisaname> a tree that has conciousness
<SpaceCore> Warehog...pfft...
<PaperDerp> warehog was a derp
<herostar> god noone plays a game for the frekin story anymore! IS THERE NO TRUE GAMER LIKE ME?!?!?!?!
<SpaceCore> Sonic'06 FTW.
<MonkeymanMlp_Fim> FACEPLANT
<Dr_Cheesums> sure
<Millsbuddy> Bump #4
<tisaname> so no
<Dr_Cheesums> im a tree?
<PaperDerp> controls weren't that bad
<PaperDerp> playable
<tisaname> no
<PaperDerp> 6.5/10 for me
<SpaceCore> IMO, the controls were horrible.
*MahBoi777 is oming sleepy
<Twojima> is any game worth playing for the story?
<tisaname> i would assume
<anon311> sonic can drift
<Dr_Cheesums> what the fuck are you on about
<SpaceCore> Portal 2 is.
<PaperDerp> nooo
<Phase4> PaperDerp, even this bit which looks ok visualy would be imposible to actualy play, erverythings aproaching to fast
<metalrainbowdashchan> back, and got some cupcakes, to wake me up XD
<Equineexcite> I'll agree, but there's no better feeling when you have complete momentum while going fast
<Dr_Cheesums> but i am a tree
<tisaname> i dont know
<Mister> If i could run on the walls, i would never use the floor
<Twojima> < not a console gamer
<Phase4> no clue how SuperBrony64 is doing ot
<anon311> is this mario kart o something?
<Phase4> it'
<Shrimp3000> Magic.
<tisaname> im insane during these hours
<Shrimp3000> and Friendship.
<Kammerjunk> SpaceCore: Well, I like most everything in Portal 2 anyway.
