7I got bored of them and just got an action replay code
/me does not know what that is
7they were on 1 hp and asleep. if they're not being caught then I'm well within my rights to use cheats
/me has always been a n00b when it came to pokemon games and is very excited to have more than 1 legendary
7I once beat the Ruby elite four only using Blaziken
awesome
7level 84. lots of full restores
7that ice [censored] absolutely slayed me the first few times I tried. [censored] sneaky water pokemon
bbl
7I miss the Aero Blast from the original silver. when it was a [censored]ing laser beam.
7same with leer. it used to be lasers coming from the eyes
lol
04anyway Quilava
04i made a mill deck XD
04kind of itching to test it out
why is this a shaymin server now?
lol
also brb
There are about 5 servers, if you connect to irc.epic-chat.net, it still connect you to one of them.
You can individually connect to one though.
Or meowth, charizard, etc.
there are 3 servers
Meowth died? :o
Yeah
ah
I believe that was the reason everyone was randomly disconnecting so often
i still sometimes disconnect at random in here but not near as often
So do I, but I think that's my internet
the ping timeout thing
back
04wb Quilava
04how goes
bored out of my mind
04play a game of magic?
04i have a couple decks to test out
04before my friends decide to play TF2
Never played it, no.
7ah
7I just melted my brain with convuluted plot-theorising for the third game
Haha.
Is it good, and what mediums is it on?
7it's purely a pc game
7and some things only strike you the second or third playthrough
7it's brilliant
7the single greatest game I've ever played
7and it doesn't even have zombies
Hmm.
7:P
Haha, I'll look into getting it. XD
I've played both games once through
once i get a new laptop ill get both
on 360 though
7although, the first game has some serious graphical [censored]-ups at times. Like with the civilian women's clothing
7oh
7I assumed it was exclusively for PC: Bioware are very pro-PC
Nope
shes a guru by association
7ah well
ok.
and are you joining them then?
04if they decide to play i will
04after all i never played TF2 with friends but i don't know when that will be i can always put them on hold until our game is over
who all is playing?
yeah
I don't know if he'll be here though
04are we going to play or are we going to waste time?
he usually is though
I'm already on :|
04oh
just wouldnt expect him here on his double day
7what times is it now where you are?
and I would play with, but I don't have it..

7:01 PM

7he's needed to fight the combine
he needs to fight the sweater factory... or the sith or something i dont know what job hes at right now
7stop trying to get into inside jokes you clearly don't understand

thank you ^^
ORCS!
sup
Not much.
Guess what today is?
tuesday
:P
Nope...
Three year OFF anniversary.
OH YAY <3
*shot*
:P
/nostalgia of the OFF days when the internet was nothing but our little group
Haha, yeah...
The blank pages on the map are being filled.
....now I'm lost
:P
Hehe.
Lol, did you block me from YouTube?
I don't think so....
*on
Was it back when this was your secret profile?
I might have a couple years ago if I was [censored]ed at you or something, what's your username
HappySnax1.
The stupidest name ever.
XD
I think it sounds cool.
well, it's stupid when you have to explain it
:P
"Unblock user" yep I must have been [censored]ed at you LOL *unblocks*
xD
Thank ye.
I havent said yayz in ages
today has kind of felt like a nostalgia day too actually, even though technically your 3 year anniversary day is tomorrow for me :P
Oh, right. :O
I wonder if the OFF will still be around when I'm like 20 years old
It's only quarter to 10 for you.
The Owler's Forum is still booming, somehow.
is it really?
wow
Mhm.
Posts every day, anyway.
that one was always waaaaaay more dead
Nikki came back the other day. That was funny.
I remember that owlboy always bugged me for some reason
He's a snob.
LOL I know right, she always logs in once like every 3 months, I got an email saying I got a PM I was like .____.; and then when I got to my inbox I was like "Oh, great...."
IM SO FRIGGIN KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT OWLS N SHAT
HEEHEE I'M SO HARDCORE, I WATCH SCARY MOVIES
AND THATS SPECIAL BECAUSE I LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC
^ xD
I'm not sure if he's active,
NOT ONLY DO I LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC BUT I'M ALSO A GIRL!!!!!!! I'M SO BRAVE!!!!!!!!!!
*shot*
What does *shot* even mean? :P
basically to show you know what you said might be dumb/arrogant/overjoking/etc
Oh, okay.
so you get shot
:'D
Since we're looking for dumb people who are entertaining, you should invite Nikki on here. xD
Or at least to #jailbait.
oh my god the horror
she'd probably be all like "IS IT SAFE????"
and "WHY????"
"CALL ME!!!!!!!!!"
IS IT SAFES IS IT SECREIT?
she's been trying to get on MM for about 6 months
since she only logs in on OFF every 2 months or so
XD
asking me what her password is
Why can't she get on?
I'm like...
how the [censored] should I know
because she forgets stuff
she's nikki
:P
:P
You should do that, though.
It'd be so hilarious.
Pretend it's an owl chat.
too much work
But for so much gain.
she dont even know anything about gog anyways, she got to page 7 of book 1 then gave up
LOL
Wow...
yeahh
/me yawns
/me :o
/me continues to work on a sad sack video
nuh uh
I just watched the second part of the interview on Jimmy Kimmel of of the Double Rainbow guy.
/me rolls out of bed
/me catches Curly
hi Proto o/ *wobbles*
/me didn't get anywhere near enough sleep
\o
/me rolls Curly back into bed
/me rolls where down a bowling lane
/me curls up under the covers
/me puts Felix on Curly's bed >:3
ew not today
/me picks Felix up then
he dragged in two dead sparrows
no cuddles for him
D:
D:
/me puts Felix in a corner
Mean Felix.
/me decides not to rant, and simply glares at Felix instead.
/me puts where next to Felix so he can keep an eye on Felix
/me doesn't think that's a good idea.
/me gives where a toothpick
For safeteh!
/me pokes Proto with it
/me dies
:o
/me casts life on Proto
/me dramatically jumps in front of said toothpick.
/me is late. :o
Sloooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
/me falls into an alligator pit.

O_O
Uh

:O
Mine's still working >:3
>:D
/me casts Life on Curly's MSN
when i'm online i either watch anime, chat, or work on my site
Now you have noone to talk to but us!
Noo Proto
Then Curly will run away into the msn tubes
04your site?
when i'm on my PC i generally work on my games, or my rom hacks
there's only one person on msn I'm talking to anyway
crystalfallows.com
Yourself?
04rom hacks, you have me interested
;o
Hi!
i host a rom hacking archive, that's apparently well known
/me hugtackles Curly and LightLie!
/me catches and eats the shoes while tackling.
/me hugs
õ_õ
04interesting...
/me pokes where's waggly eyebrows
oh i hack pokemon games, mario, harvest moon, final fantasy, zelda, and many others
just as something to do
ö_ö
Now look what you've done.
04'just as something to do'?
oh i also toy around with hacking n64 games
04gee, you must have alot of time on your hands
it's fun making your own maps for zelda 64
xD
You poked holes in them.
and inserting your own music, making events and such for it
You know, õ is apparently a letter only used in Estonian D:
i haven't gotten around to making custom models yet
Lies. :o
WHERE DID YOU GET IT, WHERE!?
like, adding more ppl
or monsters
Okay!
No?
D:
wat
04I know what you mean...generally
working with 3D models using the XYZ system is a pain
What's gõing õn? :o
and having the "bones" animated in the way you want
/me shoves where down some stairs
i generally like working on 2d games
:<
/me noms
like the gb, gba series of pokemon
or NES games
although i've been trying to finish up a project i've been working on for 5 years
04I've always wanted to make a Pokemon ROM hack, excluding the fact I have no coding experience
a hack named Pokemon WTF
04that sounds familiar for some reason
heh probably
i've been showing beta images of it randomly
for the past 5 years afterall
Sooooooo
04hmm
04Presea
I fixed the broadband gateway by breathing into it
O_o
/me isn't sure what that did but it helped :3
04If I joined up to your site, would I be able to start learning something about coding?
-_-
/me was about ready to shoot at the thing
tap it on your knee a multiple of 3, 5 or 10 times if it breakes again.

04I'm meant to learn HTML at school this term, but knowing how slow my class is to work I doubt I'm gonna learn anything
in school
i didn't learn much
i took webclass
but they just sent us around with digital camras
we didn't do much "coding"
04:|
i've had to teach myself
you can join my forums if you want, even ask tech questions and such, it is alive, just the kinda alive where nobody talks till someone else does :x
04sorta like HoR
like my chatroom
:x
04it's alove, but no one does anything until someone else does
04alive*
ya
i am aff'ed with HoR
04I noticed
04I hope you don't raeg at me for my 0 coding experience
why would i
everyone has to start somewhere
04true
04but NS has come close to raeging when I'm hopelessly pathetic at something she's trying to coach me through
04like setting up that IRC server
heh
oh i also have a server
come to think of it
though it's mostly a testing area server
04:|
i offer oper status to anyone who asks
if they need it for script testing
and if they kill the server
i just laugh
04lol
anyways i give a warning in pokemon wtf, to save often, and make backup save files
8D
because it's wtfness can get you killed in a manner of speaking
04lol
04I think I understand your meaning
recently 4chan gave me an idea
I AM NAKED
under my clothes
i plan on adding in
D:
O_o
04ohf-
/me dies of shock.
I'm naked under my clothes too :O
/me dies of sexiness.
they came up with a story about a so called "pokemon black"
ARGH CURLY NO
a horror hack of pokemon
DON'T SAY THAT JUST BEFORE I HIT ENTER
D:
Dx
i plan on adding ideas from that into my hack
D:
okay :<
I knows
/me pulls Curly to her room :D~~~~~
oh and a few other fun things
nakedness
xD
>.>
/me covers his ears, eyes and any other sensory organs
/me sneaks into LightLie's room :3
/me throws a hot dog at where

lol
04I've heard the name Pokemon Black, other than the new Pokemon game
ya
>_>
Miss Truth, is there anything I can help you with, madam?
and now that i've said that, I realise it sounds far worse than I realsied.
its what you are suppose to do with that hot dog
/me hides under LightLie's bed!
i rewired my sega genesis to overclock depending on switch settings at start to either be 7mhz or 14mhz
playing sonic at 14mhz is fun
>_>
double speed
/me pokes at the high volume of men in DT's bedroom
and if you get that item
that speeds you up
O_o
Watch out guys.
/me is still in his corner
NO PROTO
RUN
plus the item that makes you immune to damage and speeds you up more
04.-.
while it's overclocked
My corner is outside in the rain :D
/me just uses Curly's bed instead
let's see
/me teleports there >:3
:3
and I will burn my bed when I return
Ari, I have a job for you :O
8 times normal speeds
O_o
SUDDENLY QUIT MESSAGE
Yes, Madam Curly? :o
what's fun about that is, the audio processor can't keep up
so it bugs out
lol
Come sit with me!
D:
04lolwut
I don't want to know what's going on right now >.>
/me sads and implodes.
D:
/me hoses the bits off Curly
D:
Fine, stay bloody O_o
sonic spinball is.. crazy fast
Awwwwwwww
when running overclocked
No one needs me :(
if you wash him away maybe he'll never come back :<
i plan on redoing my setup
/me sulks and walks off :x
i just need a 20mhz crystal
>:D
then i can do 7, 14, and 20
Don't worry Curly, Proto's on it.
/me is going to sleep
night
bye lamdba
it's a z80 cpu.. that'd be running as fast as some 386's
/me spawns a new shell and sneakhugtackles the Curly from behind! >:3
don't leave Ari, I'm sorry D:
/me hugs Ari
/me nuzzles Curly :)
the z80 cpu was also in the gb/gbc
>.>

So I could call her LightLie!
cause I only tell the truth in the dark of night

lol Proto
/me licks the LightLie in the hugs, due to her going all >_> all the time!
/me hides
>_>
although the z80 is an 8bit cpu
Just tryin' to help.
so when you add a IDE interface to it.. it can't use the full drive
/me sticks where's tongue to the floor with super glue
let's say you add a 1GB harddrive to it, it can only see 500mbs
04o.o
I was expecting nails there tbh
She's being merciful.
yea at the moment
/me huggles LightLie <3
true
she coulda glued your tongue to afan
a fan*
probably cause I am hungry right now
Oh god.
Stop giving her ideas.
Oh no

/me gives where a brutal slap
with the nail bat? :o
>:3

You can slap people with objects
pretty old hardware but still
being able to do that to a sega

;P
/me fishslaps Proto.

xD
it's my pleasure :p
ah
i had a pirated copy
so
i never bothered trying to get online
now what about sandwiches ?
04nothing makes a game worse than your allies attacking you for playing badly
04lol
04I really hate it when your allies order you to make swarms of certain units
04it's very annoying
you can have some :o
whats on them ?
Food
:D
02o.o
02hi Drake
um, mustard, a bit of hot sauce (just to make it a bit tingly, it's not really that hot though), lettuce, ham, and a slice of ... mozarella I think
mmmmmmmmmm sounds good
or was it cheddar
either way, cheese :p

it's not dark enough

i prefer the anti pope

hi
10Well, if you're going to commit blasphemy against the true kvlt, I should totally post this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNcjcBg1ORc
10Have the happy trippy stuff instead

anyone up for a 100 sqaure mile chunk of ice?
oh no worrys the whole 2012 thing is fake
it's just global warming will kill us
8D
10Finally, someone that uses their common sense. :D
right there we got enough ice to keep our drinks cold for centuries
booya
/me dies
10XD
yes
10All my precious Paul's Iced Coffees.....
10I should buy the glacier and put turboboosters on it to control where it goes.
in the late 1800s in the midwest of the US, around my area, alot of towns made Underground sections of the towns
seems, this would be a good practice to do now
to avoid heat
:x
10Indeed
10I should do that where I live in Australia where the heat is already ridiculous anyway.
10:P
infact in those underground sections you had "roads" and sidewalks, and lines of stores
10But then we need scientists to come up with some way to stop us from going pale in future generations.
10Cause that's what happens genetically after a while when you dont need to withstand the sun.
those tanning machines
:x
10They give you cancer, and at a rate some ten times faster than the sun itself.
lol
so do cellphones
but we still use those
well
i don't
10Actually I believe that got disproved.
it's not
general usage
they proved that to be false
but overuse
that caused it
any longterm exposer to radiowaves can start issues
10Lol
for instance ppl that live near radio stations
10Well yeah, THAT much is true
the 10-100KW FM stations
that's abit...
think about living near those for like decades
something Will happen
10Yeah
10That much got proved, its basically another form of radiation sickness
ya
people make a big deal out of everything
at least we don't have to worry about tube tv's for much longer
10Tube TVs?
from the back, the protection against the xray gun is weaker
so sitting behind or off to the side of one for an excess amount of time
can be bad
for instance let's say
you have a big ass 32inch tube tv
in the living room up against the wall
and on the other side of that wall is
your bed
:x
this situation happens alot
what is giving everyone cancer is
greed
and ignorance
10Tube TVs?
yes
10I've never heard of such thing.
i'm sure
10Are they TVs in Tubes?
10:S
no silly
10OH
10Like pre-Plasma/LCD/WTFBBQ TVs that are box things?
Cathode ray tube
those
it's really a series of tubes
I had to
sorry
/me dies
Lol
10On the outside they're boxes.
yes
box tv's
/me now belongs to Espeon for 10 minutes
10Godammit
10I missed out D:
/me still belongs to Espeon for 10 more minutes
now we just have to worry about electromagnetic radiation
from our electrics
such as PCs
and HD TVs
fun
more often gamming cases aren't properly sheilded
and gammers suffer from More exposer
then ppl generally would
10You know what?
10If we do anything these days we'll get cancer
no
if you drink the water you get female hormones
not cancer
10.......................that's it?
pretty much
10Ok
10So, female hormones in a dude.
10What does that do?
well
in a 13015 year old
13-15
they are at risk of heh
getting moobs
10HEH?
10Moobs?
man boobs
10:O
also
it could explain why guys are
more often into guys
then before
if you drink amp
you get More
then you would from the water
interestingly enough
10Amp?
amp enery drink
10Ok
male gammers are at high risk of many issues
10We dont have those in Australia
your lucky
inb4 fail
as for girls
lol
the effects can only be positive
so in the future, there'll only be Females, and Herms

02(1) If reason exists then God exists.
02(2) Reason exists.
02(3) Therefore, God exists.
I <censored> lol'd
long list is long
02(1) God is either necessary or unnecessary.
02(2) God is not unnecessary, therefore God must be necessary.
02(3) Therefore, God exists.
highlightin
10LOL
02it's like 600+ reasons or something
!seen god
Looking for yourself, eh Presea?
02they're all fail
02LOL
of course i exsist
02XD
02Apparently
02this is a moral argument
02(1) Person X, a well-known atheist, was morally inferior to the rest of us.
02(2) Therefore, God exists.
/me pokes PM
02And this one is an argument from intelligence:
02(1) Look, there's really no point in me trying to explain the whole thing to you stupid atheists; it's too complicated for you to understand. God exists whether you like it or not.
02(2) Therefore, God exists.
02And I love how intelligence is underlined in green in Word
02the scribbly line thing
10lol
02this is sad
02such as sad sad document
02all of them lol

02Sorry
02We're just having problems with permissions
n.n
02(1) God is love.
02(2) Love is blind.
02(3) Stevie Wonder is blind.
02(4) Therefore, Stevie Wonder is God.
02(5) Therefore, God exists.
the <censored>
it all makes sense now
02(1) My toaster is God.
02(2) Therefore, God exists.
02lolk
02and this one is also sad
02(1) See that person spazzing on the church floor babbling incoherently?
02(2) That's how God's infinite wisdom reveals itself.
02(3) Therefore, God exists.
02I love 82 8D
0282.	ARGUMENT FROM "THE MATRIX"
02(1) We cannot prove that we don't live in a Matrix-like world.
02(2) Therefore we cannot know reality.
02(3) If reality is contingent, then everything is possible.
02(4) Therefore, God exists.
10LOL
02(1) Jesus said some really cool stuff.
02(2) No one else had said that stuff.
02(2) Therefore, God exists.
02check out number 133
02(3) That probability came from my ass, which I know assigns extremely accurate probabilities to propositions concerning the existence of God
02lol
10I gotta go
02o.o
02lolbye?
02(1) A few people saw something weird in a bowl of spaghetti.
02(2) Some Catholics believe that it is the Virgin Mary.

Anyways...
i'm done
12:p owned
12well atleast it was good to see the connection work fine
12>.> maybe i just had bad luck with brawl and tatsunoko
yeah i know i suck
the settings didn't work well for me either
i usually only use three items
12well i was rust when im at my best can handle the computers at ..... level 8
i do level 1 computers
12>.> 9 is a pain in the rear
but pikachu is my best
12much harder than 9 in melee
at least u didn't spam with meta knight
12i used to mainly use mario but he kinda sucks in brawl
my friend spams with him
12>.> spams suck
he uses that tornado
as a spam
it's so annoying
12i just try attack in stead of ONLY uing a coupel of attacks
12friend does that to me with pit....
at least u weren't an asshole playing
lol
12:p
other person i know spams marth
12the counter move right
yea
he spams that
12>.. did that in melee against mainly bowser and ganandorf
my friend hannah always plays as pit
but she hates the fact that her brother spams marth's counter move
12yah hate that move
and then his friend spams meta knight's tornado
ur rly good though
12:D
12yep from hours of playing
shame we don't have spyro for the wii
04what's wrong?
12doubt spyro would have online.....
yeah
12unless they did a time attack or something then leader boards
u ever do dark spyro walkthrough?
like play as dark spyro the whole game?
12yah did long time ago
oh
my friend did it recently
12pretty much the best way to get good in brwl put the computers on a high lever so it forces you to get good at timing
*sighs be right back i gotta check on my neighbor's cat
12not 9 though!
12ok

Did Felix soften the landing? :o

I was on the edge of the bed and rolled off when the alarm started beeping at me
mmhm
it was just an interesting way to wake up :p
so now Sky has 200,000,000 floof insects :P
The most interesting way that I woke up was back in either '06 or '07 when I woke up without my underwear when I clearly went to bed in them D:
Apparently, I slept so restlessly that the underwear made its way down my legs and onto the floor o.o
Which is not surprising, since I quite often wake up under the bedsheets these days.

Welcome back DRF!
7WB.
03thanks
03my friend came over
wb drf
03and we started talking about NIntendo hacking for half an hour LOL
<late>
03It's now technically legal to hack your consoles
wow
o.o
03but, at the same time, it's also legal for Nintendo to void your warranty for doing so
03I like my friend's analogy
it is?
03it's like making it legal to rob a bank, but then making it legal for the cops to arrest you
03Yep
wb drf
03as of about 2 weeks ago
03they made Jailbreaking and all of that legal
wb drf
weird o.o
*somewhatlate*
lol
Very interesting
03that's not weird, it's actually really awesome XD
still weird
*wonders if hacking his PSP is possible*
03Which PSP do you have?
If I can hack it, I might actually use it!
03the original or slim?
03LOL
3000
03oh
03nope, it's not hackable.
Damn it...
03only 1000 and 2000 are hackable
033000 can be TIF-exploited but that only works until you turn it off LOL
I should have gotten a 2000...
03yeah
03I actually paid for a 2000 on eBay and the dude sent me a 1000 LOL
03I would have returned it but it was in like, brand new condition so I decided to just keep it
1000s are like bricks, are they not?
:S
03Actually not really
03my friend has a 2000, it's not that much slimmer
03it's about half the weight
03but as for being "slim', it's only like 1/4" smaller
03kinda misleading IMO

Hii
dragon time then jump over them
i tried that yesterday
/me eats Kyu
how are you today ?
it's just hard for me cause i don't time it right
Bored XD
You?
i did use dark spyro's move at one point
hmm.... same, i'm killing time on forums
i wonder what's the point of those lasers anyway
death
Ah
x3
Im lonely
well that and like are they supposed to be like the conduits?
after arrow left i guess
... conduits are annoying at times
i'm sorry *friendly hugs*
i earth shot them
i hate the leeches
2i wanna friendly hug D:
and crystal golems
:D
yw
and it doesn't waste all ur mana either
2il take that as a no....
/me 2crys
did u say u can do that same move on the executioner?
7hah
that and my support if you need it
/me squishes
yep
oh ok
shame it doesn't work on skabb
2i still want one D:
:(
it doesn't does it?
works takes longer though...
Alright.
^^
easy to get hit by him though
ah
i know someone who used fire breath on him
interesting.... alot of new info on black/white today including a feature called dream world
level 4 triple fire balls work just takes a long time to kill him that way
2rly?
2whats it like?
2wat
2wi
well they used comet dash
2wait*
http://serebii.net/blackwhite/dreamworld.shtml
along with melee
2is it that thing
2where you put your pokemon in it?
2andmeet other people's pokemon?
no this is a completely new just announced feature
2oh
hey May
hey
first time i faced skabb i did that
2awsome!
meaning you can spread useful TMs across your entire team if desired
another new feature is the Pokemon Musical mode
2col!!!!
2cool*
Huzzah, done making pancakes :D
this feature will allow you to enter your pokemon in the musical and earn items
hi quil :)
second time dark spyro!
2oh yah
2i saw that
i wonder if skabb's hard on the gameboy advance
but by far the most interesting change imo is Miracle Shooter
2o_O
your earn pts every turn in a wireless battle and then when you have enough you can spend it on items IN BATTLE
you*
2O_O
definitely adding yet another layer of strategy to the games
2indee
2indeed
2they need to make it
2so you evolve in battle
2THAT would be cool
anyone know?
Not for me...
>.>
i think that might of been one of the ideas they're throwing around apparently
oh was he easy?
2yah
2there is a thred here about it
i'm about 80% sure they're implement it
unless it becomes too difficult to code
or has a potential to cause glitches
all of them on 1st play through :p
what about second time around?
scabb... didn't learn tricks yet
and gual
second time around for me, skabb, arborick, and ravage rider
gaul was a pain till i understood his pattern
Uh
Against it, because I dont see the point anymore..
I think they're really trying alot of new concept this time around tho and that you should still give it a chance
>.> boss battles in brawl on intense completely destroys gaul
alot of these new features look to refresh games as well as the metagame
the metagame hasn't been changed like this in a long time
2the look really good
2im REALLY exited for the animated battles
2arti :D
12Hi!
hi
especially tabuu's 1 hit ko move....
hey sup Articuno :)
did you hear about all the significant changes to the metagame that are being implemented with black/white ?
12Nothing much, just waiting around for Lugia again XD
12Dont think so
you haven't heard about dream world yet ? or the pokemon musicals, TMs not disappearing after use
damn too many to list out, alot of changes to the base game are being made
2i dont know ifi like the musicals :x
2they look wierd
12Where can I read all of this?
still the potential to earn items is nice
12hi Articuno
12Hi!
http://serebii.net/index2.shtml
12:)
12Thanks!
omg
12how goes
i hate that
2whats the "metagame"?
12what's currently being played the most
12what you might have the most chances of fighting off against
2T_T
the metagame is very base of the game, the very core
12either that or it's something you make that is designed to beat another thing someone has
12i've seen it used in both terms
it's almost like the framework of the game, things that carry over each and every game
could never beat boss battles on intense....
12"stop metagaming my abomasnow deck"
odd someone told me that using dark spyro during the 1st part of the Gaul fight, u don't get hit
i meant the metagame of the video games
!define metagame
-!- Metagaming is a broad term usually used to define any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. ...
ugh hey they were wrong
:p
u tried it?
2:(
yep
what happens?
7o3o
you still get hit just now its twice as hard to killg aul
7Metagame is the game outside the game.
7Hence, meta.
2wuan :D
12Wow too much to take in here..
12I'm starting to lose itnerest, and I'm just looking up the new Pokemon instead XD
oh someone did tell me the pots rumor is truw
*true
the pots in Gaul's first stage
ALOT is changing in black/white articuno
12lol
12metaknight :D
2i just hope they dont chnge it TOO much ..
2change*
hi
do u ever hit Gaul in the air when he puts u in his spin?
7o3o
7Refresh?
2i would have bought the game canges or not =/
no i just land
oh i do
2i dont undestand why people arnt as exited for the animated battles as i am xD
wonder what happens to u when he swings his arms back and forth?
maybe a few too many
round 2 does 1/3 damage to your health... per hit
dang
7It depends on the game; for example, Chess's metagame is the study of all the openings and strategies and the like.
i only hate his laser eye
2woh
2wth
2?
2i keep getting adds in mibbit for a pokemonMMORPG

speaking of which
anybody notice Google had a Wizard of Oz theme today?
oh wait
how is that speaking of which?
XD
2i guess not =/
It did.
Ever hear of that miniseries Tin Man?
nope
It's a unique spin on the Wizard of Oz story. Pretty cool and more sci-fi.
Awww
Takes place in modern to futuristic societies, but with magic still.
he didn't greet himself
oh cool
is there still a scarecrow and cowardly lion?
Yes, but they are different.
The story is so original yet it has a ton of references to the actual story.
*mainly
The Tin Men are policement, the Scarecrow is an inventor whose brain was stolen by the "Sorceress", and the lion is a humanoid species that has pyschic abilities.
*policemen
haha wow
tin men?
well that's not right
:P
Yeah, they are a disbanded group of cops from "Central City."
But there's only one in the story.
I've only watched one part of three, but they're on Netflix so I figured I'd watch them.
Sorry for slow response on this one, I blame my ISP but...
"Here is your book" *Harry Potter shown* "Here is your book on drugs" Twilight shown
XD
:P
anywho
Central City = Emerald City?
Basically. The Sorceress is looking for the emerald.
The Wizard is in Central City.

I heard We Are The Living is quite controversial.
whichever is the one about the Russian Revolution is the one that isn't very good
pfft, all her books are controversial
Yeah, but that one especially.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=559qJvtg5lQ

I have them both
She thrived into controversy.

Wait, it's just boring? Not stupid?
or it has a boring plot at least
it's cliche
not quite boring
all it is is a love triangle story
:/ I expected better from her.
Yeah We The Living
well, remember it was her first book
:)

The Fountainhead is amazing
I don't agree with the message 100%

Good grief this Duke Nukem Forever thing is insane
Yes?
You remember I said I had water trapped in my ear, well it developed into an infection. XD
Seriously? That's awful.
So I'm pretty much deaf in one ear, can be useful for when I don't want to listen to someone though.
^ XDDD
I can totally see that advantage.
WHAT?!?!?
Ohh, nevermind...
I randomly go deaf from time to time anyway, which is especially handy when I'm babysitting.
Is this selective deafness, or for real? :P
Somewhere in between.
I have awful hearing as it is, but I also tune out people automatically.
It gets quite annoying, though, when I have to control how quiet or loud I am, or how softly I should whisper, etc.
Because I don't hear things the way average people do.
My hearing's not so great either, under normal circumstances.
Apparently I talk really loudly.
Ha, Censor Cat got you.
cirstances then.
:P
Wow... someone's status on Facebook is "Jerk off session at my place!"
...Ooooooooooook.
I'd avoid that person if I were you. :P
I try to. She's an annoying... female dog.
She? O_o
Yes. O_O
It was obviosly a joke, but poor taste. :P
Wow, slut much?
*obviously
Failbook can be fun, however. I love commenting on statuses that are song lyrics and responding seriously.
Hahaha, that's great.
Like one was from a Brand New song, and it goes: "Do you ever wake up and realize your life is meaningless?" And I responded: "That happened to me once, then I realized I had just woken up in a dream in which I'm an existential nihilist.
"
Sorry, had to go AFK for a min.

Nope. Probably didn't know what it was. :/

Lol, I hadn't even thought it could be fox.
Me either, haha.
Well, what's up?
Not much, you?
Eatin' cereal... spilling it... biting my lip by accident.
It's the little things that hold the pleasure.
Lol.
It's 2:20 AM, and as useful, I'm wide awake.

Ever wonder what it'd be like to cry urine?

Mhm. Not to mention asll warm..

I suppose it could be pleasant if your face is freezing.

like Up is weird after you realize a kid disappeared with an old man in a flying house for a few weeks and then comes back as if nothing happened :p
oh
Yeah, I just have no idea what to put right now
XD
i thought he was a chick
10HAHAHA
I'll sign up tonight
heh
You need to make it clear that you don't give a shit about what he has to say.
^ Truth
The lugiabot is crazy!
I've only seen a few current movies
And theres always an ignore button
10^true ture
10true*
10i know
click on his name and select "ignore"/
Up, no country for old men and 2012
that's because they actually removed the BSOD completely from the OS
so it can't actually happen
O:
10but then he'll say stuff behind my back
no country for old men was great :D
OF course, it's PERFECT
So what?
10oh wait
2012 had me off the edge of my seat. XD
there's a PM button too
10that doesnt work
I agree Curly
Hes some kid 5000 miles away from you.
Literally.
it failed
Actually, it happened once
so if your pc does crash, no blue screen
2012 had me laughing really hard
10i tried it a couple of times and it wont work
I leaned forward and slipped off the couch.
Andrew, ORLY
I've gotten a couple bluescreens on u7
-u
looked just like XP but with a more modern font LOL
10hey JLF can you see this post?
yea
Due to a bad Soundblaster card
it was caused by faulty hardware, but still.
10damn
yeah
10see PM button doesnt work
in my case it was a RAID controller
stinks
i wanna PM
Audio card
I know what SoundBlaster is
10i would punch it if it wasnt made of pixels

*boom boom pow

http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/695e37ed-b205-4085-9e0c-3d7975fc8c75.jpg <- This reminds me of the average Mac user
10i think he's fueled on pissing people off
how does he know?
JLF: OH NOES
no kidding.....
does he watch me play?
my i7 started in about that but it's a lot slower now as I have like 10 hard drives and those all add to the boot time :/
10omg
10he's a stalker
12hai
what does that mean?
10gah
What doi you care if he thinks you suck at video games? xD

You called him a girl.

Gee, it sure is boring around here...
nope
ah
i stopped at least fav level
celestial caves
<.<
so boring
i know especially the rooms
it's so tedius
The whole game should be
Celestial caves.
why?
I just wanted to contradict, I don't know.
oh
lol
i prefer the mountain
level
I let my friend borrow TLOS: ANB for llike five months... turns out he sold it with all of his other GameCube games. D:
Holy
wow
What
I just saw someone use the "o3o" face outside of TST
Wow, that disease must be deadlier than I thought
/me hides
ouch
/me gets into the closet
Same with SSBM.
ugh major ouch.......
He honestly didn't mean to, but it was annoying.
new beginning wasn't too bad minus the scorpions
/me gets into the basement, under the closet
and the cynder's lair
He just piled all of his hames up and brought them for trade-in.
*games
scorpions were lame i just ice speared em
>.> better not of been at gamestop
like the worst place to sell them at
/me forgets supplies!
i hated Cynder's lair
it was too long
Yes, that was before I enlightened him that trade-ins there are a scam.
I think you'll be find
i hate gamestop
i shop at play n trade
only time i EVER buy from them is if a they have a good deal on a *NEW* game
otherwise i usually stick to amazon
GameStop has a good deal going on right now.
A lot of games are like 20 dollars off.
I don't know what I'm going to do, though. I have one dollar and Reach comes out in a month.
:P
lol
If I only had one more dollar, maybe they could procreate and have a litter of quarters.
i'm kinda tempted to get metroid other m mainly due to the $20 bonus but i know i wouldnt like it
Mhm.

thx
the only part of the celestial caves i liked was the elemental dragon and meeting the chronicler
Hello?
!espeon
elemental dragon was sooo easy
LOL 1 minute

/me belongs to /me
:U
I'm done XD
/me explodes in anger

!espeon
wth
yeah

1 thing i dislike about anb was the long distance between the 1st save point in tall plains....
/me yawns
/me used a Bullhorn- Your Mom's calling for ya!
same here.
I'd run out of lives and have to start back the ENTIRE world.
When I was a noob at it, thta is.

/me blinks
I don't get the default quit messgae
Blah, company coming, gotta vacuum my room -.-
*message
/me called his friend!
o3o
ah
Birdy beaks
elemental dragon is a pain cause u try and refill ur health or mana and she hits u

Lucky
/me yawns

WTF]'
What just happened?
Strange
ping
ocean.lugia.us said could not connect, ocean.systemnet.info kicked me off
something about no CGI:IRC access
14owo
I'm using Nest ATM :/
14Something happened?
Yeah
it said terminated
and I can't get back on
I had to switch servers
14Huh. I'm on ocean.
12Stop acting like it's a bad thing DRF D:<
Random Quote: We need your oven, Star Fox!
12Ocean has gone down more times this week than Nest has in an entire month XD
LOL
I just like ocean better
it has SSL
Not that I use SSL on Mibbit, but still.
12Fine I'll put SSL on nest then
I never lose my connections
14Ocean's had a habit of being the better server.
Or I can just use ocean :>
yeah,t hat.
Ok back...
dunno what's wrong with the datacenter, nothing's perfect
man everyone left
12Only because it doesn't get VNCed onto and isn't on wireless XD
LOL wireless
fail
Wireless servers?
12Hey didn't I say it would stop going down as soon as I got cable broadband though?
but I still don't care XD
12Now it only goes down when I VNC on and forget to set the display options to 16bit (for some reason that disconnects the wireless)
I wonder what type of computer it is?
12Take a guess
Linux?
12No but I considered putting that on because of how slow it is
Windows?
12Yeh
What version?
They go through bone like butter!
12XP
12Pro
12You should guess what specs it has
Thats old
/me throws ninja butterknives!
Pentium 4?
12Nope
AMD?
12no
EW AMD
Intel Core 2 Duo
12Nope
12Can I just tell you?
Tell us!
12It's an intel celeron R 2.53ghz and 256 ram
better than when it used to be dead for days
12But hey, it does the job!
That is your personal?
Ocean does the job better
/me runs
12Personal what?
Computer
yeah
hat happened to all the member status? did the updating reset everything?
*what
12It was someone's personal computer
12and no, nothing's actually been updated, I just messed up
Oh no
ok
12You see the meteor shower last night?
o.O no
Maybe
http://thisisphotobomb.com/2010/08/11/photobomb-that-guy-roflcopter-gets-its-wings/
Was it like lightning?
12One of them was
when was that?
12It burned up into three pieces and glowed different colours
12Last night
what kinda time?
12Uhh, 11.30ish
was in bed then
Nope, too many thunder storms, strangely starting at about 9:30 Pm
12Well actually we were out at 10.45 when we saw the biggest
Wait... I did see it!
we keep getting up at like 6am every moring now, and have started to have early nights coz we get so tired
Angel flares! :D
There were about 10 seconds per flash
wait what? there's a meteor shower?
Was
oh
that's too bad
I haven't really gone to go see a meteor shower yet
lol
Ah, I tried waking up for that
I couldn't
I never really seen a meteor shower before...
I've
12I go after every meteor shower that occurs
12Even if I have to travel somewhere with clear skies
12It's quite important to me I guess you could say
There are always too many cloulds and lights in my area!
Wtf >_>
12LOL I love that message
What is Ocean again?
what messages
it'd be really nice if u didn't have to face the assassin twice
-s
Oh
12(Nick collision)

04Bus

12Ouch, not really.. sorry
04k...
google maps?
/me just lol'ed so hard.
they have an option for public transit
http://thisisphotobomb.com/2010/08/12/photobomb-that-guy-screw-it-up-jenga/
12I'm guessing you'll wanna stay on the A19 though
at least here they do, they should have it in the UK too
04Oh I have no idea...
12Yes they do have that come to think of it
yeah
just put in your start and end points and click public transit
and it'll tell you which bus routes to take
:)
I've done that a bit at the university as we can't have cars on campus LOL
12I just tried it, it's being stupid and only giving me national express routes
04Wheres Public Transit?
Um
Not sure actually, haven't used the site in a while
12How come not train then?
/me nibbles on some catnip and passes out
04It costs a lot apparently.
12Train's usually always cheaper than bus
12Let me check.....
ask Xai to hook you up with a free ride?
/me runs
12That reminds me, I'm getting my free rail pass in two months!
Why?
XD
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
12That means I won't need Xai to get us on free anymore, I can go on my own
Yes
12I will have been living with him for two years :>

Android 2.2 isa wesome
I just moved a 10MB app to my SD card
and it's now only using 200KB on my phone ^^
that's the one thing that's annoying, how little space I get for apps
12I can upgrade too, right?
Um
you have to root your phone
No idea.
12Lame
12I'm too lazy
or wait for the company to release an upgrade
Root?
like
ugh i hate this level
same as jailbreaking an iPhone
but easier
Oh.
well
Don't have either
Verizon hasn't officially released 2.2
so therefore the only way to get it is via root
if your cell provider releases it
then you're fine
the last one :D
probably not though :/
do you even have 2.0?

I have none
/me has a kitty in his lap
I was asking Articuno
12I think I have 1.5 but can't remembver
yeah, that's a huge jump then LOL
You'd have to upgrade to 1.6, then 2.0, then 2.1, THEN 2.2
:/
12LOL
Mine came with 2.0, I upgraded to 2.1, then to 202

When adjusting the blades on an electric mower, it is advisable to switch it off first.
Really?
LOL
LOL
but wouldn't you prefer to cut your hand off first, drf?
14What are you hyped about?
Oh sheeeshums
That is much better
14'w'
hm
apparently on Mibbit
setting your away time to 0
makes it infinite
14Does it?
14I'd figured it would do opposite, having you away all of the time.
How do you put text near your name on Java?
nope
I just asked in their help channel
/me 14like this?
0 is infinite
which is actually used in programming a lot so that makes sense
14Or like drf's name?
wait what
I just used |
Just because the car in front of you is going doesn’t mean the light is green. <- LOL
Strange...
stupid guys in the fire room
When taking pictures at your 6 year old sister’s first performance in a play,make sure you have the right blue-eyed blonde. A camera full of pictures of a random little girl’s performance will not go over well with your parents. <- LOL
Time for some long, long rest :o

Good bye.

it gives me something to do

2HSM
my opinion why there were soo many crappy games the developers assumed the wii would fail when they found out it started selling really well they rushed games onto it resulting in more crappy games then many gamers just left the system
/me hugs JLF
07i'm impressed that there's something wrong with my computer that's actually MY fault for once

10I meant hater fanboys is when the fanboys go around finding something to HATE @Espeon
LOL
:P
I've had a Blu-Ray drive
Oh

I've hated HSM since before you called me a hater fanboy

you don't want to use old RAM
2i salvaged it from my other computer

old RAM is slow
2its not from n old computer

It's thundering, not gonna get to go
07mine is an evga
Articuno, can I PM you?
EVGA makes good video cards

It'll probably be fine in about an hour though
073 way sli capable o3o
2how much is a good graphics card? @_@
$200 or so?

and use that
spamed it
nvm
LOL
I just typed random letters.
#qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm use that one then
spamed it
and you realize you don't have to type channels to join them
just type /join #channel
/join #channel
...
with no spaces
and change #channel to the channel you want to join
soz
this isn't rocket science
#heythischannelisrubbesh jion this new chanel
join*
7yeah what?
i also spamed that channel
no./
lol
why would we join it knowing that you're going to spam it?
Well... ther'es been some funny stuff going on in SC concerning you.
*there's
lol
7oh?
Yep. Basically eveyr n00b on SC was whining about you to SR, and SR went on this big rant. xD
*every
7oh?
Oh.
7that was an 'expand' oh, not a conformation oh
I know, haha.
It was full of lulz because SR was being incredibly hypocrticial.
*hypocritical
7what did SR say?
Mostly harmless stuff, because he doesn't intend to ban you or anything.
He just kept going on about how they shouldn't listen to you and how [censored]y you can be.
7if he hasn't banned me yet he won't ban me now
But he went out of his way to act like a good admin, which I've never seen him do. And to nooblets no less.
xD This isn't a warning.
yay waffles
drf, how many tabs do you have open?
If your older cousin just finished doing time for statutory rape and is living with you and your parents and if perchance your friend comes over and said cousin asks him how old he is (to which he replies "18"), please refrain from saying, "That’s what she said!"
LOL
in Firefox or in Mibbit o.o;
firefox

why?
I have like 19 at home XD

*number
.....
I have 19 at home.
this work computer sucks
2like over 9000?
that's insane
XD
well
I don't bookmark stuff, instead I just leave the tabs open
until I'm no longer interested
call me weird, but it works
so you leave your computer on all day?
well i'll ttyl u all later
Yeah.
oh my
I host a server off it

.....

what's so bad about that?
You use more electricity doing your laundry for an hour than you do running your computer for a day
o.o
I knew someone that said if they turned their computer off, it would crash
LOL
nah, it doesn't do that
but
I leave IRC on for logging purposes, I need Windows running to record TV shows... and I also need it on so people can use my server.
so I decided to turn off his computer just to make him mad
LOL
I got grounded after that D:
7... he's a BOT.
7he's not even a he.
Bots are people too.
well
bbl, going home.

hello Proto
hi
I feel like crap...but I think I'm getting paid good
And hot water on a bad sunburn feels like you're on fire
:)
Hi Proto :)
hi
what's your job?
It's a temp job, I'm helping paint a large building
Heyaaa
the ends are shorter, maybe 1/2 the length of the building but several feet higher, took 3 and half hours for one of those with one roller
And we /just/ started painting
we pressure washed it yesterday
Don't do that! I could get lead poisoning
one roller?
I was standing for every second of those three and a half hours in >90* weather...yay florida
2:x
all the guy in charge brought
2i forgot how frail you humans are =/
Thats gonna take a week
You know, to avoid lead poisoning, all you need is a strict regimen of chelating chemicals.
sounds not good
nah, just a few more days
(Of course you'll still get lead poisoning... but it might take a few years of more exposure.)
2.-.
2im imune to lead poisening
no you aren't
2i found the cure
no one is immune
2i am with my cure :P
Also, for the lulz I read the 00,01infamous "04,01Boatmurdered" Let's Play of Dwarf Fortress.
7Back.
2i hate dwarf fortress D:
One bit of summary: "What does this lever do?" *thwump* *sizzle* *sniff sniff* "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED OUTSIDE! IT'S ALL ON FIRE!"
2lol
2guest!!!
not
2oh..
Yeah, you know your fortress is safe from goblin hordes when you have the "Outdoor Magma Death Lever" at your disposal. :P
2hi HSM
Hi
(Warning: The Outdoor Magma Death Lever is not to be used outdoors.)
2lol
But that is the point!
Trick them to pull it, and splash!
2lol
2bah
Wow long gap
2of words?
2i know
2....
2im loosing mytouch
Actually, the easiet way to use the Outdoor Magma Death Lever, is have it inside, and use it when the invading army enters the map.
I was on Epicwinftw
That it too easy!
That us
That is
Unfortunately, badly mistimed invasions can also result in converting your friendly caravan merchants into crispy fried cinders. (Oops.)
Don't forget the daily mailman!
Those Mailboxes are deadly when armed.
/me always causes silence...
Also... fun crazy things to do:
What were talking about?
Cast a giant Monolith out of obsidan in front of your front door. BEHOLD THE EIGHTEEN STOREY HIGH AWESOMENESS! :P

Dwarf Fortress is hilarious.
Strange question- Has anyone made a Lugia Mailbox?
2HA its funny how apple thinks im going to rea a 62 page terms and agreemnt for an app
2read*
Think different...
Every company wants you to read their EUAL.
:s/EUAL/EULA
2well i DONT
Well, then you can't complain about the software borking. :P
(Becuase you can't really complain about software that borks, and that you agreed to use the software that borks, because the software borking is spelled out in the EULA, and that the company that made the software is not responsible for it borking. :P )

12Dark spyro...
Hey Icy. :P
oh
12Hello my ex-husband.

Lawl.
but why don't furies work on bosses?
12speaking of bad graphics >.> would it of kileld treasure ot make sin and punishment star successor to NOT have 2001,2002 ps2 graphics.....
lol Chaos + Fallout 3 = awsome
12they only do 1/4 damage i believe
Oh, i didn't know we were using legendaries
yeah sucks
12JLF: I thought you said furries lol
no lol
furies
Srry got logged out
another thing that makes no sense
in new beginning the only fury that killed those commanders was earth fury
6well
in eternal night all the furies kill the commanders
6favorite p[okemon
6no limit on legendaries
6it would be lugia and charizard (both are tied)
that makes no sense
My fav legend is probably rayquaza too, cuz I owned emerald wit him
6dude, shorter name?
12the later furies were stronger in anb
6and stop changing your name please
sounds awesome
Who? aura?
oh cause the only strong fury in anb for me was earth
6yes
12it was the strongest thats why :p
I kept getting logged out and i forgot watt I set as my name
even fully upgraded the other ones didn't kill the commanders
6well
12fire was weakest then electricity then ice then earth
6that's why you-
6:|
Oh, and probably myy third would be staraptor cuz he owns
6OK FEIN IGNORE ME
6anyhoo
Dang, man what's goin on
12back
I ran my ANB disk on my PC a couple times.
12they're all the same in eternal night i believe
Everything look so screwed up.
6we're getting a LOAD of new people all of a sudden
6like
6the past 3 weeks
12They all seemed the same to me...
i don't like fire in ten
12yah o-o
it misses
the fury i mean
All the screnery was black with code on it. O_o
I know right
12lovely glitch on it >.>
Hola earth
i like the electricity fury on ten
12o.o
Lol
what?
Laaaaaa~
and the convexity fury was diff too
6ok are you going to STAY with this name?
I was AuraWindsWhiteRayquaza11
6we know
Lol
in anb it was diff than in ten
Hey LL is back
/me nods

12Laaaaa~
Okay. So what was ur favorite pokemon gen?

03:3~
.
U mean the region? Er watt?
Wat I meAn
i wonder why?
12the Laaaa~ is getting old

12"!setgreet" changes it, right?
Cuz u asked,
12I'm gonna kill her...
^ lulz
yes LL
12!setgreet A "wild" Latias appears!
No, I mean why was it ur favorite
A "wild" Latias appears!
Icy: I think you missed a word out of that sentence, what of mine is screwed up? :P
xD
12ok ;o
oh hahaha
I think hoenn cuz it haz rayquaza- and salamence!
Oh the third generation
!setgreet i'rpowpo'wc'huú :>
I just think salamence has been over hyped
My mIRC says I've had it for 9361 days.
So u like the first generation?
Which makes no sense, because I'm not 25, and nor is my computer.
I also like flygon though
i'rpowpo'wc'huú :>
Yeah
12o.o
:o
12<.<
All dragon types last evolutions
nvm
And legends
Yeah, prob first gen cuz it was easier to get every pokemon
03:3
But I also like high hp normal type pokemon cuz they can know a variety of moves.
i r powpow chu :>
Lol only 4 people chatting
:o
yeah, but normal moves arent super effective against anything
I meant like nornal types can know blizzard,fire moves,electric moves,ETC.
now whats ur fav game from Red all the way to white if uve played it
Hmm
I understand, normal types are awesome
Firered for me cuz u had the same 151 and new moves and plot elements
Well I never played any of the game boy color pokemon games only gameboy advance and ds.
12WHATS DA﻿ WORD ON DAT
Blue/red were awesome.
huh?
U other guys got anything to say
Yeah I think I like fr lg r s e d p pltnm and hg ss haha all of them I've played I like
sorry dari
12What?
yeah lol
But I don't hack er do action replay
but there was one thing i didnt like about D/P/Pt
Hmm?
lol zeke and luther
There was only one freaking fire type other than the starter and that was ponyta
12NO!NO! NOT THAT
12Bacicly all games were like that
12Oh go I turned into Cyndi... aka the old me... wtf?
lol
what u mean?
12So I always had to do the fire type although I hate chitchat and torchic
12Chimchar
12I mean
i sooo wanna see nanny mcphee returns
12Why would they do that?
12Like in fire red there wasn't any fire types exept ponyta way later in the game
12But leaf green was fine
12Vilpix
12Well I'm not one to talk, I liked transformers 2. :L
idk
12Well emerald had numel torkoal and slugma
i g2g talk to u guys later
where did light latias go?
12Shrugs
12Later!
/me is still here...
well, i had already said slugma for 2 gen though
4Does this count as a too light color that I'd get banned for?
6no
no. i can read it
4Kk
Hey do u guys battle competetively?
12So...
4Yeah?
4What?
...So.
6not really
4What do u mean
Well, do u guys care about nature, EV's and stuff?
6I personally don't agree with what smogon has done to the pokemon games
4Oh that
I don't really
how so?
4No I don't give aboUt that
6I'll look for the right nature, but I don't really care about EVs
People must talk. :o
4Gtg soon
6well, smogon has made ALL the rules for "competitive" battling, from who's an uber and banned, to what moves are banned (including double team),
I don't really care, I just pick awesome pokemon and just raise them as i see fit
4Why
what u mean why?
6and seriously EVERYONE will catch the right natured pokemon with the right IVs and then train them with max EVs, making the whole system voided
4Why do they ban moves etc if people use them still
6well
I never really use double team
6if you battle through smogon
6people don't use double team
6because it's banned
like shoddy battles
4I'm more of an attacker and none of my pokemon have other moves than ones that inflict dsm
4Damage
4Shoddy?
6lol, all my pokemon are balanced for attacks and status moves
the pro way to go is pokesav
4Not mE I have a full team of 6lvl 100 salamence
and that's not even a joke
/me dies
yeah, sometimes I'll use agility or toxic, but im not muchof a spiker or stealth rock user
6full team of salamece?
/me pokes Kitten
suddenly ice beam
6so, if I whip out my Lapras, what'll you do?
6ice beam yes
4Yeah I raised then by transporting 6 bag on into platinum at the start of the game
I prefer to have tyhe most types of pokemon who work well together
4Bagon
6I choose favorites, tbh
4I mean
6and work with what I have
what Aurora said. Most pokemon have SOME sort of potential
me too, but i wont get like a team of 6 pikachus
6of course, some of my favorites tend to be the powerhouses in some way
Espeon isn't bad afterall.
|D
4I just hate slamence don't know any elect. Moves or ice moves
6espeon + psychic + shadow ball = dominance
xD
true i did that and i owned
/me 6nuzlockes
ffffffffff
if I nuzlocked and had an Espeon
and lost it
O_o
rageface
:P
6lol
which one I write my teams down for each starter
TRULY THOSE CRITS ARE PESKY
6I think using eevee is against the nuzlocke rules though
Nope.
6because it wasn't captured
12Dari's gay...
6idk....it wasn't clear about that
4Firered your whole team of six pokemon
12AHAHAHA
Some people go by traded Pokemon as counting in the "first Pokemon in a zone" rule
6in the first season, groudon had to be destroyed
4Wat?
6but the second one, lapras was put on the team
6ah
Well, not really, my dad speaks Farsi.
a comic made of win
I know but I have different teams for each starter
6that started a revolution
4Oh
6crap almost lost my poochyena there ._.
4Well what was ur charizard starter team?
I haven't?
Ill brb
4Kk
I highly doubt it.
Because I've never joined it.
lol
I have auto-accept invites on.
6more importantly, one of the funnest versions of pokemon ever.
its ok
6Ever.
i see
But I think I would have realised if I did.
Aye, i got it
4For fire red
what Roara said xD
and quite nice
basically Pokemon - Hard Mode
4Awesome
Nope, the name Darius.
I'm kind of a nerd cuz I write em all down
4We had 2 of the same
6hmm
6I should get to work on page 3 of my nuzlocke archive
ahan
4Well, I do too cuz I want to remember my strategies when I start a new game
6cuz I now have a team :|
4.
the fallen shall never be forgotten
asjdajfa

screw u
JLF is female, right? Just confirming.
yes
Is JLF even part of the /original/ group? 8D
idc
7no
the correct way to say it is "I think x is better than y"
I think I could.
7she joined like two weeks ago
12LOL AT PIC
SC2 kept getting it's release date pushed back nd people got mad, so they trolled battle.bet until the beta was released lol
7OOOH. I may know a way to get Malefor!
Or the correct way is to say "X is better than Apple", and it will always be true
12That reminds me, Ineed to watch that show on Youtube so I can actually see what people are finding so funny
/me facepalms
/me hides

7I'm no longer welcome at darkspyro. Mods are quick as bunnies.
I never trolled Bnet, just got mad a it
at*
and the fact that it's "interactive", it'll just go silent for a few seconds and they expect little kids to shout stuff at the TV LOL, then they're like "You're right!"
12I could tell him...

/me runs
Hi :3
13Why the left one?
XD
apparently they gave him a paycheck that was more than it should have been
and he cashed it
then they realized their mistake
and his next paycheck was literally only $14 for 2 weeks of work
i can't wait for the batman sequel
so he quit
:D
6o-o
6um
Overkill ^
6thats illegal LOL
@yquote
well
@yquote
6lol
6unless he worked like an hour a week
@yquote
7It really freaks people out that I know all of the people that kill Chuck Norris in The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny
nope
@yquote
he worked full time
6yeah that's illegal lol
is it illegal if they overpaid him previously though?
6CNN > Chuck Norris Network
6overpaid by how much?
...nobody?
they were like "wait, we shoudln't have paid you that much, give us our money back"
a few hundred LOL
6That was the ultimate pwn
6oh
6I wouldn't quit over that
7we should hunt down Ember for the reunion
well
apparently he still owed them money
It pwns more when you replace Chuck Norris with a member of avenged sevenfold.
6if they made up for it by giving me most of my two checks at once, and then the rest of the second
they were going to do the same on his NEXT paycheck
course the penguin idk
i'd rather see the riddler
6tbh that's stupid

Apparently some gal thinks that I looked like Ronnie James Dio maybe half an hour ago. D: And she then touched my hair and complimented the healthiness of the hairlings. And it all happened after we had just gotten dressed after skinny dipping o.o

oh, my bad, the bottom 60cm
6holy crap that's the japanese version of the song?
:3
6so high pitched D:
What song, Aurora?
6the japanese lavender city one
Ah
/me is tired
03sounds thes ame to me o.o
03*same
/me pets the Curly on the head.
It is 2 am and I was told to run around with people from since like 6 pm ._.
6I don't know if you can hear the same frequencies as me
6I apparently can hear higher than most
6*most people
back
Maybe, except for the part that most people did not appear until 11 pm D:
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 <- OK WTF
03That story in there
6and wow
03sounds made up to me
6the story to Black version is bizarre
03that audio sounds *just* like the game to me
6the story for the song sounds made up
03nothing odd there
03o.o
6but the black version one is awesome
6drf, there are points that have some really high requencies
6frequencies
enjoy, Ari o/
03hm
03I heard some high stuff yeah
6to some people, high enough to cause problems
03but wtf at seizures and stuff
03...
03you mean like dogs?
6sorta
03but people could actually die?
6if they have epilepsy and it can be triggered by such high sounds yeah
03...
03I thought epilepsy was *visual*
6no
03like the Porygon episode deal
6er
03wtf
03well I can hear some high pitched sounds in that but I'm still alive
6epilepsy as far as I know isn't just that
6so can I, I'm still alive
6we don't get seizures from it
03wtf @ that whooshing sound
03at like 3:00
6technically, epilepsy is an overload of electric signals to the brain
6so it could be triggered by sound as well
03._.
03well
03what I don't get is
03if the dude remixed it
03how come he didn't just get seizures right aweay?
03*away
03he listened to it all that time before anything happened?
6I guess
6like i said, I don't believe the story
6but it *IS* possible, I believe
03WTF
/me tacklefallhugs the Curly from the ceiling! :3
03at 8:50 it gets all weird

I'll be back in a bit
6drf
6on the 10 minute long movie
6at 4:11 is a good point where there's some high frequency sounds
03<bluesun> the other vid by the same uploader is an obvious fake
03> ?
03<bluesun> why would the Japanese version use English text which didn't exist at the time lol
03<bluesun> actually same @ the other one
03his other one is something about embedded images in the Ruins of Alph
Have fun :o
bye all
and typically I AM usually cheerful
03yeah I hear those @ 4:11
6k, those are the highest on the file
6unless youtube destroyed the actual frequencies
6which could be possible
6but yeah, I image some people could be affected by that, and if you have headphones
6yeah
-_- i dont know what the heck a hollerback girl is, but whatever it is, it should be drug out in the street and shot ~.~

03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjYIYcdH7rs <- LMAO

I have a question... why do movie makers now intentionally try to sabotage the cinematography. I mean REALLY. LENS FLARE IS BAD PEOPLE! THE STEADICAM WAS INVENTED 04FOR A REASON! GETTING THE LENS DIRTY SHOULDN'T BE A GOOD THING! THAT SHOULD GET YOU FIRED! Excuse the rant.
031. The uploader claims he never listened to it... but yet around 8 minutes in you see some Unown saying "LEAVE NOW" and then it gets all weird sounding
03There's no way in heck an audio analysis program did that
03meaning somebody had to
03which means he had to have listened to it...

Thank you for filling in the gaps, it was driving me mad :p

Hey guys.
12 Hello, Cassie and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Anyone around?
Hey. You made it.
I did.
Again, not a good example. Everyone idle.
Want to go to another channel?
*everyone's
Does that mean I have to do all of that complicated [censored] again?
Not really.
I'm such a noob xD
And okay.
Just go back to the home tab and change your server and channel.
It will get easier the more you do it.
Change it to what?
Server (where it says IRC) Mibbit. Channel: #mibbit
Easy.
Ah okay
You can stay in this place, also.
:o
Hey!
I brought a friend home.
:D
/me waves to Cassie ^^
:3
/me plops down with a sandwich and a beer
Hehe.
apparently it's a "cream ale"
she's figuring out Mibbit right now on another channel.
you can't say I don't like alcohol for lack of trying >_>
hehe
also I must be a masochist or something
:o
stupid jerk. I can't help but keep reading that channel just in case people don't like him as much as I do but they never do >_>
so... final verdict: beer still tastes horrible :X
/me dumps it out >.>
:3
Aww, my sweet innocent Curly drinking alcohol :(
I wish I had punched the wall harder
I try to figure out what people like about it whenever there's alcohol in the fridge >_>
hehe
I found that beer tastes best if you just toss it back so you can't taste it <_<
>.>
Why hasn't my nickname changed in this channel?
It doesn't change everywhere.
/me is
Unless you're on the same server.
Just write /nick Looking_at_Stars.
:)
Hmm
SPEAK
A "wild" Latias appears!
/me is a deep red and lets out a sigh
Take my hand, son.
hey
no
:P
It's clean...
x
Updated my ipod
Lost everything
nice
not nice
Aw, cute.
Took me awhie to get this back on track
Awhile
/me spins a web in the rafters
[censored] activision
is it their fault?
Everything bad is
oh yeah
because of the ancient curse of ygunc
Dammiy it to hell
haha
Dammiy you all!
and don't even give it the luxury of a good paddling
People are talking :]
ohai
Yup.
You're slow to respond. xd
Bwha
Yeah no paddeling
:P
I'm incap.
Hello
heya
hi
pokemanz
#Jailbait has been neglected lately.
The name suggests it wouldnt be to favorable
Yeah. :)
Jailbait, that's a song by Motorhead >.>
<.< Gonna go see them live this year.
Hmm
Motorhead's pretty cool.
No way!
?
I've seen them live twice.
:D
*nods* Makes sense/
Need any help with commands?
Erm, okay.
Bwha
Start with hitting /help
I've been told that.
Its not good
I feel sick >_>
drank too fast x_x
I apologize.
Salright
Might wanna tone it down though
Unless you like scaring people too
A little difficult.
I do, actually.
Ooh we have something in common
/me just drank 2 shots
:D
going for another in a min
Curly: Why are you drinking alcohol? :o
I try every now and then to see if I like it :X
How festive
Why?
Why do you want to like it?
/me offers Curly cokes instead
Ha.
I don't know >.>
Well, we are not very alike, are we?
i just poured 3 shots worth of gin into my iced coffee
I'm crazy :x
lol
neither of you ever make sense
you're not crazy kari-chan
:P
Most likely no
in that way all three of us are alike
I make sense.
An order within a disorder.
Liar
"In all disorder there is a secret order, in all chaos a cosmos."
/me shrugs.
Curly: Marijuana is safer for you than alcohol
Try that instead
Dirty festive liar!
my case rests
Hehehe.
:3
I've tried, marijuana doesn't do anything for me :<
And nothing is safer than marijuana :3
/me slaps everyone with a 4r7a8i9n3b2o6w trout
hmmm
You festive storm
rainbow trout spin attack!
/me doesn't take kindly to terrorists,
/me resists fighting Stormalong.
6Hmm
6So you can see this colour?
Of course.
Plurpleberry.
Gooseberry
/me also wonders why Curly has had an interest in doing drugs lately >.>
3black
Boisonberry.
/me offers hot chocolate instead :D
Cassie: so, do you like IRC thus far?
Elderberry
Cyberry
Your father smelled of them
I don't have an interest in drugs <.<
I have no idea
/me points to alcohol
That blows
6Yeah, tt's better than the silly flash chat on the other website
6it's*
well, I'm not really interested in alcohol so much as why people like it
Has it been done?
No
not that I know of
/me waves to Cassie
YES
NO
Oh, guys, I brought a friend home,
Hello Cassy
Cassie
Okies :x
*
6Hello
Len hw ti typ
XD
I think wine tastes okay
I haven't tried any other kinds of alcohol though
4hello Cassie
6Hello.
rdx
/me has never tried any of it
She's a government agent I hired to check up on you guys.
unless beer when I was three and wine at church count
Pfft
Oh, hehe
I would have already seen and got rid of her
otherwise I see no point in any of it
You're overestimate your own prowess.
Oh, there's lots of points to it :3
/me still doesn't recommend it :3
I have a theory that a lot of young people only like alcohol because it is entertaining to their friends./
Underestimate is more the worf
Word
I agree with this theory
:P Which in turn shows your overestimation.
Think what you want
You are wrong
I'm frequently wrong; not the issure here.
*issue
My grandparents on my dad's side don't have any alcohol in their house
and out of respect for them we don't have it at our house when they come over
Not an issue no
they drink a ton of soda though...
But its here
its crazy, probably more than they drink in mexico.
It is?
Can you not see it?
I'm a blind, old man. xD
I can't even see my bran flakes.
hehehe
6Lol
Ahh death is around the corner then eh?
My mom is against alcohol quite a bit -- I think her grandfather on her mom's side was an alcoholic or something
And how do you know those are even bran flakes then?
Hey where
Because I trust my butler, Chives.
No one in my family is at all against alcohol
aka dari?
no wait
However, I would like it very much to die.
You shouldnt
Not too much against it, just doesn't want it in the house
No, he's Jeeves.
I own thw company
The
I could arrange that
The company's jurisdiction does not extend here.
/me is just against societal comfort of alcohol, especially when it's safer than drugs that are societal taboos
/me doesn't like hypocracy :x
Thats what ypu were told
You
I know it, because I formed the company.
With my own Play Doh
How is that hypocritical?
Although true
Your mind is slipping to
I cannot account for the memories that elude me as my mind deteriorates.
But I can only trust Alfred and myself.
Alfred chives?
/me nods.
Its always the butler that did it
Only in the stories, young xr.
in the kitchen
with the bar of soap
In Soviet Russia, butler do you.
with Colonel Mustard's assistance
Hell if there was a butler in clue hed always be the one to do it
XD
Well, in the US, for example, marijuana is outlawed in most states, but alcohol is not. Marijuana is actually a safer drug than alcohol, and yet, marijuana use can land you in jail, alcohol use is accepted in society, and quiet often encouraged
I thought there was.
Ah.
anyway, brb.
kk
Never tried it, so I can't really say if it's safer or not
Well, I mean, if you think about it -- alcohol often leads to sexual assaults and domestic violence, and you don't have those issues with marijuana
At least, I never heard of anyone who became high on marijuana and beat someone up
you just have stoners spacing out and getting hungry
Exactly
The stories lie. They lie to us all. Fiction is the new fact.
and addicted
and their brain cells slowly killed off if I'm not mistaken
although alcohol does that too
The worlds full of liars
/me has a stoner friend
Like that activision [censored]
Well, you can really get addicted with anything, including on World of Warcraft or IRC -- the real question to ask is, how much of a chemical addiction does marijuana lead to, and how much does alcohol lead to
Liars are full of the world.
Heh
he's fun to hang out with
I lie you lie we all lie
when he isn't high that is
Its nature
but even then
For lielipops.
he is never in a proper state of mind
The studies I've seen show that marijuana is less addictive than caffiene
They are delicious
I can believe that
It goes: marijuana, caffiene, alcohol, nicotine, heroin
it may not be scientifically addictive
Thrilling
And pleasing
But not nutricious.
chemically addictive :3
but it's affects might be addictive on a different way
right
that's what I meant
Yeah, that's a good point
*effects
Like in the way that WoW is addictive
Nothing is anymore
exactly
So it doesnt hurt much
they get addicted to that state of mind
but not the drug itself
That's actually a very good point
I like it when it... hurts.
Pain in the best feeling little one
Its almost the only one that doesnt makes cringe
*ninety
I'm not advocating drug use, btw >.>
okay good
18 years and a few beers
just saying it's better than alcohol?
So you're advocating not using both alcohol and illegal drugs
:D
/me is spared
We'll put their names to the test.
Whos to say were not ones
Heavy Stalkers with increased Firepower and shields
They would tear you to pieces
Plus
Haha, you have Satrcraft on the brain, man.
/me adds a few Void Rays to the mix
*Starcraft
I'm playing it
SC@
*2
I'm saying that the societal acceptance of alcohol is bad and that alcohol is actually a pretty dangerous drug
StarCraft2
I'm aware.
Just pointing it out.
Bwha i was think WOW
OF COURSE I HAVE IT ON THE BRAIN
I agree with that
Like, right on top of it? Or more interior?
but it seemed like you were saying the opposite about marijuana
Yes
well
sort of
It seems to me like it's only dangerous to certain people
People who don't know how to control themselves with it
but it can be do anyone
and people who might be predisposed to becoming alcoholics
To which?
*to
Hello
how are u?
I was using marijuana as a comparison point, since the societal conception of marijuana is that it's a bad drug, as opposed to alcohol
Surviving you?
It was an overall answer
Can't be both.
Why not
good
why u surviving?
If it is directly on top, it cannot be interior.
Of course, doing nothing is safer than all of the above :3
Unless part of it is interior, and another part is on top
hard day?
"Nothing" is non-addictive, has no withdrawl symptoms, and you can't become intoxicated over it
But was that specified? Nah.
in my opinion it's better to not even risk it
How would I know? I don't have an alcohol problem. :P
:3
So I don't know.
Umm it means im doing well enough
Sure
oh sry
lol
You new here?
I know
:P
but that's the reason I don't plan on drinking
What do you know
Nothing more than you allow me to.
I'll probably do marijuana before I start drinking :3
Good deal
I can't think of any experiences I've had with drunks that were good
and I don't want to risk becoming one
nope
/me doesn't plan on it though
i'm JLF
It's not like you're going to become drunk after one drink
My reasoning is limited to your permission, it seems.
Ohhh
My family drinks with meals all the time
Seems pretty harmless to me
Why tripp?
It's not like you're gonna become a stoner after one joint
no but considering the possibility of being addicted, it can become harder and harder to stop for some people
It is
and I just don't want to risk that for myself
/me has a pretty addictive personality
/me doesn't do anything with moderation
/me can't think of that last thing he did while exercising moderation
just needed a diff nickname
my dad drinks with meals all the time
but my mom does not
plus he's the main character of my fav show
because it doesn't take her much to get drunk
and she doesn't want to be drunk in front of my sister and I
:3
/me is probably addicted to caffiene :x
I'm not saying there's a problem with people who drink in moderation
people who are high on weed don't do bad things. they're too busy eating munchies and playing videaogames
lol
just that when someone starts drinking they're taking a chance
alchohol
because they don't know their own liklihood of getting addicted
make sure someone else has the keys and u'll be fine
Qh
Ah*
you know i think that justin long of yours is gonna be a charcter in a movie coming up
Looks very stupid though
Your mind is mine
do u know how many hits it would take to od on pot?
oh going the distance?
it looks cute
i like some romantic comedy movies
it's somewhere around 1,517
I think were thinking of different movies
oh? what movie are u thinking of?
Its calles Alpha and Omega
hey
oh
that
Called
xD
it looks ok
i don't like the animation
looks bad animation wise
lol
......

They looked starved
Bolt was rly goos
To mold and shape for your purpose. Yes, master. @_@

so i had to delete them
Do you have the whole first spyro game soundtracks

I have most of the second one and a few of the third
:o
the hero's tail soundtrack is good
I must meditate

SO I CAN LEVEL UP!
nah but pieces
Go ahead, Siddhartha.
Seeya.
Never played the middle ones
ah
Looked cheesyv
Cheesy
lol
Was i right?
hero's tail isn't too bad
just collecting items sucks
It usually does
Not always but usually
Ok no hardley ever
lol
Lol i like collecting stuff in most games
As long as they have at least one purpose
well in hero's tail u gotta collect light gems
and dragon eggs
Light gems sound wierd
yea
But eggs are cool
to collect them u need to do mini games
which i hate
Yummy too
i'm not one who likes collecting crap
Bad mini games?
i prefer TLOS
kinda
the mini games fit each level
You collect things in DotD
like this swamp level in hero's tail has u shooting critters
yeah but in dotd it's easy
plus no mini games in dot
*dotd
Not one of the magic gems
I actually had to cheat
odd
Cheat=youtube
oh
night
It was one under the bridge in the burned lands
ah ok
i hate that level
too many enemies
Ah well hey i need slumber
k

Still little young me has to go to school

Pieces

6Everyone's idle.
the number 4 cause is falling out of trees
6Apart from me
I'm here.
6._.
6And you
Everyone else doesn't respond to me because i'm a weirdo.
*I'm
6Hmm
6You left the other chat :/
6I'm all alone now.
I know.
They were boring me.
Cassie: They won't rape you or anything, haha.
6xD
6Well...
Ninja might though.
He's only talking to you because you're female.
6I guessed that
6Are they any other decent channels?
6there*
Yeah, there's a few. Also on Mibbit there is an international channel, #chat. As for epic-chat... well, list it.
Those are mainly the servers i use.
*I
6Ahh okay.
I'm here :D
Just type /list and if there's not lag it'll come to you soon.
Shows all of the chans on this server.
:D
XD I rest my case.
OBJECTION!
Permitted.
:3
6I should've said I was male.
Will the defendant please rise (from stasis inside of a glass box)?
Eh, don't let them scare you.
/me is harmless :3
Just don't advertise yourself and you'll be fine.
6OMG I typed the / list thing...
6Woah.
It's massive, i know. xd
*I
/me blinks

So, did you get the pic? Hahaha.
nosir
'Twas a joke, my good man.
A response to the blinking and its innuendo...

I am a wicked child.
6Well I'mma go now folks
6Bye :]
Awww
Okay, seeya.
/me waves goodbye to Cassie
She'll be bawk.
I hope so :3
I like her
Her words are purple
/me likes a girl who types in purple
Girls who type in blue are okay in my book too
According to ancient Chinese proverb, "A girl who types in blue is pretty good for you. A girl who types in pink is headed for the shrink."
I'm not sure about black though
"A girl who types in black ..... has a nice rack?"
"A girl who types in green is kind of mean?"
/me waves to everyone who joined in the last 15 minutes
moo
:o
/me hides behind Curly
/me dies just so she can come back to life
hola
in my case it does
No ma'am, you're not a kitty
......... or are you?
no not a cat :|
:o
deities can do that
as long as they have believers
yoos a deity?
xD
for now I will say no
darn
i need a new belief system
lol
Something other than D&D? :o
ive never gotten into dd actually
mmos yes dd not so much
/me played FFXI some
.... your nick looks soooooooo familiar to me :o
name forums youve been on
f
:O
/me trips where
Forums I've been on.... hmmm
I'm on all of them
/me falls over
\:O/
ive been on eqinterface, wowinterface, various game forums
o_O
wanted to haven't yet
Hmmm
it looks fun though
i currently play city of heroes thats my main game
/me thinks
links allowed?
Sure
/me gives up
my one friend is convinced I look like Kat Von D ..... I just don't see it lol
lol
every time she calls she brings that up
FFXI!
Do I know you from FFXI?
i only lvld a toon to 17 solo before i decided it was too grindy i only knew two ppl so probably not
i only played for 30 days
You remember what server you were in? :o
/me was a tarutaru ^^
/me had the red mage clothes :3
probably wasn't that one if you name them i can tell you which one it was
oh nm
you were a tarutaru
derr
http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/dyn/server-status.html
misread it
im pretty sure it was bahamut
i played one of the oversized lizard looking ogre thingys
ooooooo, okay
/me loved the red mage artifact armor
Once I got it, it was like, mission achieved, I can quit now
i wanted to unlock dancer and the beast tamer but
i didn't get to it
i like to solo and that game is too grindy for that
Yeah :/
i r not good with ppls
he was a monk/warr
I didn't like going around spamming "{Tarutaru} {Red Mage}/{White Mage} LVL 52 LFP -- PLEASE {Invite} I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR HOURS"
lol
what do you play now
IRC
nothing, really
ive always got a game
And then once you got into a party, it was just CTRL+A, wait, .............. CTRL+A, wait.......... etc
if i unsup to an mmo i fall back on free ones
i tried allods yesterday
but it wouldn't let me use custom mouse buttons for alternate skill trays
so i ditched it
And if you were a mage, it was like CTRL+1, CTRL+2, .... wait.... CTRL+1, CTRL+2, .... wait....
i liked the gameplay
and i loved the gamepad support for it
it was a great game the xp pentalties for soloing were just screwed up
"omg u n00b u dun use provoke unless you need to lol"
lol
most ppl quit soloing by 10 i made it to 17
Once you get to 10, soloing gets kinda difficult -- monsters that are a difficult challenge usually can beat you up
yep i didn't run into that til about 15
monks are sturdy
by 17 it was getting to be a crapshoot whether i could win a white con fight
Everything is just so slowwwwwwwwwwwwww
indeed
and xp loss on death
It gets slower and slower as you progress
not good
It grinds to a halt at level 50
yep thats one of the reasons i was hesitant to continue solo you get 1000 xp for a mob at 75 just the same as you do at 10
And everything looks the same :/
as far as the mob models?
/me nods
i thought it was a beautiful game honestly.
but i tweaked the ini file
The scenery was beautiful
to make it less shimmer
so it wasn't quite an eyesor
Which game?
ffxi
The scenery was beautiful but the monsters were all the same
Haven't played it.
Once you get past level 30, you've seen all the monsters
lol
A level 80 goblin looks exactly like a level 3 goblin
aren't they coming out with another ff mmo
/me nods
I might try that one out
Hey Cjman!
A "wild" Latias appears!
Heya lol
A "wild" Latias appears!
That was mean :(
Why would you do such a thing? :O
:o
But it was in the eye!
Nighters all~
nini
it's softness counteracted the pain
its*
Oh :o
A "wild" Latias appears!
:D
nothing in the eye is friendly
hard enough it can even be deadly
/me sighs
not even water?
water is uncool
it burns
what if you have soap in your eye
then water is friendly
then its the lesser of two evils
lol
i prefer nothing in my eyes
hmm
xD
/me wonders if he knows char :o
<zips it shut
:o
/me does!
I only got you pregnant 4 times.
Your the mother of my children.
you're*
A "wild" Latias appears!
/me fails at texting
I'm back... good to see no one has spoken. :/
i don't have a phone to text i have to use ims or email
lol
you can use mindpowers instead
that's what I do
I text with my mindpowers
my mind is not as adequate as yours
/me has a pretty okay mind
you do
i don't
/me shrugs
Lul
/me texted the anonymous person back
/me deep-sighs
I got no such text
:o
I texted someone back
well
not me
char: Did you send me a text?

I texteded back
I said fsdajadfshkl;sfdhlsadfjklsafdhjfasdlfadslafsdl

It's like a 1up

I'm gonna go up there for a student government conference thingy
/me is going there at the end of the month

I'm going there at the end of September
hmm
/me is poor
/me empties pockets

I'll drive you
/me watches lint fall out

lol
sweet.
frikken religious conservatives
;D
Well, it's Al Abahmah, what do you expect?
04hello
:P
why dont you you go yourself, then you can stay in any room you'd like.
(not with the group)
Umm
or is it a group thing
It's likely just going to be me and the PTK president
whats PTK? I know you said what it stood for before
brb
but what is it
It's basically an honors society
For two-year colleges
alright
They do stuff, but the point of joining is for the scholarships
ah
extra perks?
Well, yeah, you get special honors at graduation and you get to put it down on your resume
I put a lot of things on my resume.
Yeah, same here
even the smallest things I do I blow them way out of prportion :P
back
Same here xD
Like, all the awards I won for technology competitions when I was like eight
I made a video game once called "The Diamond of Ages" or something like that
Ive made really crappy games with gamemaker a while back
Using a video game kit, didn't do any programming,
"professional game developer"
man I want an invite to google app inventor so bad
you can make android apps so easy apparently.
I mostly talked about my accomplishments in AYSO for my college resume -- I said that I was the youngest referee assessor in the south eastern United States, which was probably true
I talk a lot about my online endavours
and some volenteer work, apparently people like to see a bit of that.
Yeah
and ive done a bit of retail too
so ive got a lot of bases covered.
/me likes how he can be among the 25 most qualified scocer referees in North Alabama based on experience and practical knowledge, and yet, a handful spectators, who knows how much experience he has, feel like they know what they're talking about enough to shout out "bad call ref" onto the field, even thoguh they're 50 yards away and I'm within 5 yards away from the play
soccer*
It's like, if the roles were reversed, and at their place of work at McDonalds, you wouldn't see me telling them that the pickles go on before the sauce >.>
peopleare just angry.
Yeah, it's an emotional game for some people, I guess
I've never really understood how people can get so emotional over youth sports
If you don't know what you're looking at, though, I suppose some things in soccer can seem unfair
Or tripping is another good one -- sure, it's illegal to trip, but it's not illegal when someone doesn't look out where they're going and fall over someone's foot like an idiot :P
</rant>
I suppose it's a little more annoying for stand up comedians
hecklers are the bane of the earth
that's gypsies
why gypsies
because
ummm
Does anyone use that term anymore? The days of the Roman Empire are over >.>
I mean, The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a good movie and all, but that was 10 years ago

Goodbye, Dari, fair maiden!
Cya,
12lol
12it's a random place in the middle of nowhere
12of course it's going to be hated
12GAAAAH
12I just tried starting a new game on Platinum right..
12I forgot how freaking long it took to get the nature of your starter Pokemon >v<
12I can't be bothered now
12I'll be there all day'
12lol
12simple solution
12don't worry about it
12unless if it hurts the starter
12I want the right nature!
12the only pokemon i really took the time and waited to get the right nature for was lugia
12only because i had no choice but to catch it to proceed
talking about SS?
12yes
ahh
yeah, Whirl Isles was hard =(
I got lost a lot
12i had no interest in catching lugia
D:
12so that's why it irritated me
/me 12»»12 WinAmp 12«»-12 Dark Dialga 12«»-12 00:03/06:40 [75¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦7] 12«»-12 192 kbps mp3 12««
I almost freaked when I caught my Lugia
6yo arti
12Rar
ahh
that's ineresting
12That looks just perfect
6articuno should do the nuzlocke challenge of Platinum
6:>
12Much better than the last one I saw
6what last one?
12I'll get apic
lol I read that as "epic"
6sigh, made the elbow too far away from the shoulder
12Only a little
12It's barely noticavle
12*noticable -v-
6holy crap that one's way nice
12All you have to do is shift the shoulder along a bit
6the feet bother me though
12Yes
12Exactly
12It's not as good as yours
12The head isn't as good as yours
6the rest of that is spot on
7But what about the tail? O3o
12The rest of it looks like yours
6what ABOUT the tail?
12LOL
12Was gonna say that
tail
6yeah, in that second skeleton, those feet are WAY off for an avian skeleton
6between the heel and the toes, it should be one solid bone
6not 3 digits
6that's more like what we have
6hmm
6well
6one bone, plus the slim one in the back
12There's other things wrong with it
12It has... teeth.. lots of teeth Ovo
6yeah that too
6just noticed it when I zoomed in
6and I don't believe lugia has external nostrils, tbh
6dunno how to explain that
6like...
6yeah, I dunno lol
04hmm
12I cant explain that either XD
12It's not something I like to think about :>
6I guess one explanation would be (gross)
6the nostrils being on the roof of the mouth
6but wait
6that makes no sense :P
6I love thinking about it
6I love trying to understand lugia
/me curls up

12haha... nothing..
XD
RC is the cheap knockoff of coke and pepsi
lol
Oh
Never heard of it
i thought rc cola was a brand to itself
It is
royal crown
I hand't either until I saw it in the Walmart break room
12Soooo..
:)
The Walmart break room didn't have Sam's Cola?
sits and looks at stars
nope
that's all they have in ours
or maybe not
/me 12looks with Majesty.
they had all of the above except Sam's Cola actually
oddly enough
I don't drink the stuff so I don't know
the vendors are lazy as crap in our break room
haha, why?
dont know
barks: stars are cool.
it's just never full?
we always ran out of all the cheap stuff
12Yeah...
all the cans
vending machines are dirty as heck, always broke, and half the time empty
Wal Mart breakroom here doesn't have it
sees the half moon
it's all our product
all?
wpah
yup
*woah
mine has rc pepsi and coke
same
but the rc is in the Pepsi machine
and a sams water but thats always broke and there for show
how I remember that I have no idea
howls at it
/me 12looks at Majesty
12Heh...
less than two more weeks of working there
woo
or not, since I won't have another job
you can buy a 2 liter for 20 cents more than a can if you could just walk a few feet
/me 12awkwardly turns away.
:(
why?
i'm gona be the only one in the walmart club now
haha
I'll probably try to get hired at the one there
we're still members at heart :P
barks: you ok?
12Yeah.
I feel bad for you if you work for Wally World lol
but the hours I'm available suck for working
unless you're a manager
hell at heart we would have sold our souls...
stands by him
It really isn't that bad
Just a lot of repetitive work
12:)
I can't work with morons
I go nuts if I do
I think of it this way
if your doing it for a living it can be bad as you dont get very much respect from the higher ups
maintenance isn't all that repetitive really
barks: what do you want to do?
:P but it's maintenance
so how fun can that be
12I don't know...
If you work with morons, you get to tell them what to do and have a better chance of getting promotions
:P
lays in grass
/me has a kitty next to him :)
I would be more inclined to tell them how stupid they are
hence why I like my job
12>.>
I work by myself
12YOU GOT THE TOUCH
looks at a rock
????
lol
I basically do
12lol
I work wit others
but my work doesn't require me to interact with them
hold on
if no one hinders me i'll do pretty good but if someone starts messing with me then friction is gona grind
they do their job, I do mine
I get annoyed with some of the guys I work with
lol
This one older dude always asks me "what's wrong?" for no reason
Hahaha
lol
sounds like me pa
hoe vuyr
And then this other guy kept reporting to me at one point like I was a supervisor or something
how cute rather
back
XD
What did you do?
12Hey...
lol
yeah??
so much for my proper key alignment
tell him to clean the bathrooms
"Um, okay? Manager is over there"
04murr
04^^
I figured I might as well make use of it and have him grab me some baby clothes to put on the mod
how is?
12Love you...
XD
or tell him to go make a bale
barks: thx...
:)
04i'm alright
blushes
04how are you
He kept asking me stuff like if he was getting the right product
remember the first time you guys talked about bales and I thought you meant hay bales?
i swear... i'm the only one in the store that doesnt mind makeing a cardboard bale
Like it actually mattered if he was doing the right thing
I don't mind it
me neither
just flatten the boxes and press a button
then fasten the cords
and done
12*cuddles*
lol and if you dont have wires..
Cuddles back
mmm, okay I guess
my store has done without wires for about a week.. and i had to make a couple bales with a spool of wire and pliars
oh fun
that's something I've noticed about walmart
they never seem to have the right supplies when you need them
04i see
hahaha
to be honest
5howls happily
He's sleeping kinda now :3
that happens a lot in all three of the places I've ever worked
12Sooo...
or trading in crappy equipment for event crappier ones... that break down and are never fixed for months
we were out of toilet paper for the last three days at Knitcraft
5...
lol
/me humphumps
lots of angry factory workers
/me eeps
12Majesty: YOU GOT DA TOUCH! :3
But the supervisors are supposed to plan ahead for what we're going to need to build fixtures
and we always run out of something
ha
silly supervisors
never know what they're doing
Today it was these sticky label covers that go on the rolling shelf tables
how old
5whut ever touch i have... *pokes him* you have it! ^_^
:P
5runs
12D:
5lol
what did you end up having to use instead?
nothing
we have to wait until more ship in
5does a play bow
/me 12tackels Majesty.
5laughs
ha
on worse days we'll run out of shelves or grid or something else more important
Usually peg hooks
12^_^
oh wow
/me watches
I hate when they tell us we don't have the right size and make us use different ones
5gets up
peg hooks?
because we know we're just going to have to change it again when the right ones come in
5tackles him
those bars that merchandise hangs on
ah
that's what I thought
watches what?
and they have you just use the wrong size until the right ones come in?
yeah
/me 12dodges.
!uptime
Uptime: 2wks 5days 4hrs 47mins 34secs
04you
The uptime of shadow.ambernova.net is 041day 9hrs 12mins 39secs.
12hehe.
5gets up
5jumps
5tries to get him
night
http://shaymin.epic-chat.net/funny/
yeah, I can see how that would get annoying
12Let me smell yo duck!
12;D
5???
having to put everything on one
just to take it off later
12That was random.
and put a new one in
5i know ROTFL
our store just rotated co managers and i hope i can keep my mp3 player
haha
/me 12tackles Majesty while she distracted.
before I forget
what's a picklist?
if not... then i guess i may be there shorter than i would think
pick list?
http://shaymin.epic-chat.net/funny/Grudge%20Monkey.jpg
yes?
XD
a list of songs you want in order
I always heard the instock people talking about it
oh same age as mine
5gets up and tackles him back
I saw a pick list by the telxon batteries today
oh wait..,.
but I couldn't make any sense of it
12Hehe...
lol
:P
12*kisses*
5looks at him and smiles
the picklist is greenzone which was stock that was run that wouldn't go on the shelf that has been bined and then taken out to be run for the next night out
12;D
so
if a whole case of cheerios wont go out you send it back to the back and later someone in the back will pick it on the pick list and send it back to you on a later night
basically it's the extra items that don't need to be stocked that night?
5howls
yeah
5gets up
the shelf is full and you cant get any more in its spot so you send it to the back
5cudles him
oh okay
/me yawns
/me 12cuddles back.
I would always here all the instock people over the intercom
"Aisle 12 is done, moving on to pick list"
really?
we dont do that
and later "Aisle 12 pick list is done, moving on to aisle 13"
I don't think we even have an intercom
I've never heard it
woah, really?
every ten seconds it's going off at mine
5ok
employees just communicate with the walkies
we have an intercom but people never talk into it properly so its used with no effect
"Manger Brad line one please, Manager Brad line one"
5if i can find u on myspace ill add u if u want me too anyway
yeah at ours the walkies are pretty much just for the managers and supervisors
the associates use the intercom to communicate
they need to give me one
12You can add me, but I never go one, I only made one because my brother made me.
so I don't have to run around the store to find a department manager every time a customer needs help
5ok
yeah
or your store needs an intercom
listen at the winona walmart sometime
12Why you comin' home five in the mon' "Stupid lyrics'
you'll hear the intercom saying "Customer assistance needed in blah blah blah department"
all the time
Those fools have no idea that I would never let them destroy the Walmart.
He's just so adorable
Wal Mart and Google shall battle for world domination
He's so introverted, but sometimes he goes *mew* and sits next to me :3
http://i35.tinypic.com/25qcaww.png
5huh??
hmmm
or take it over in different mediums
I dunno which I'd root for
12Nevermind.
probably Google
I'll fight on Google's side only if they employ me
:P
5lol
:P
there you go
/me 12cuddles Majesty.
make it your rules
Walmart would be the Sparta to Google's Athens.
5cuddles backness
XD
12I'm just in a loving mood right now...
Walmart has the army and Google has the brains?
Exactly.
5lol same
wow that actually makes sense

:P
hahaha

Since when?
no he means in Athens they don't

5im not going to be here sat tho.
5:(

yeah greeks are bad with women
*didn't
but in Sparta the women were regarded as more important than the men
12:O
she wants what she wants when she wants it but try to give her attention otherwise
One word: Breeders.
and ull lose your face or worse

didn;t they actually examine the babies and decide how worthy they were?
yes
12You'll be ok..
Yeah, or, just like 300, you were cast aside.
theyd also throw them down a mountain
5okness
5:)
5:P
yeah if they were unworthy
and actually the cycle worked quite well for awhile lol
5:E
5oops
5lol
Sometimes they'd leave them outside and if the elements didn't finish them they'd be reclaimed.
12Tounge!!!!
They had a very powerful society in their hayday
women's rights, sure
i guess its sort of an artificial selection
sleep. *amsg*
Yeah, sounds like it
/me has a calico!
12Haha :E
but only for the good enough women
and actually survival of the fitest is what the world truly thrives on
5LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They raped, except Greece only feel because it had no sense of unity.
*fell
by using it they ensured they were always the strongest
12<:3
Sparta ruined it for them all by not aiding the other polises when it could have.
also the gods ruined it by being jerkfaces
When did Sparta not aid them
:P
5hold on my ANNOYING FRIEND IS STILL TXTING MEH!!!!!! I HATE HER> IM GOING TO KILL HER... *killes other kristen*
At the fall of Greece, forgot who their mutual enemy was.
12o.O
All nations in Greece did at that point
Macedonia was too strong and all Greek Nations were independent, as they were when the Romans invaded
They were coming from the east, and Athens was their gateway inside to the other city-states.
By not helping out Athens, they let the enemy in, and stronger.
12Jizz in my pants= PURE WIN
which war are you referring to
5LOL!!!!!
Can't remember the name.
I'll look it up.
by that point the Spartans had already been to Thermopolea
blarg
blarg?
12*pounces*
and they assembled their army to battle at Platea while the Athenian fleet was victorias at Salamis
But I'm bored of discussing this anyway, haha.
brb

This is not an admittance of defeat.
My kitty has gray and black and a little bit of brown :3

5laughs lightly
"Doesn't that hurt you?" "Like the D ickens!"
lol
This hurts you, Shepard
If I must tear you apart Shepard, I will
[/masseffect]

!random
Things was never thick and keeps complicated
i had a calico as a kid
lol
she was the most antisocial and stupid cat
@quote
she never learned what windows were
Wait, she likes it now? xD
she would constantly jump at the window after the birds
She does
she has for a while
D: Well, KJ must have been abrasive.
/me 12nuzzles Majesty
Sorry, I'm unobservant.

Cupcake attacks anything inanimate that moves.
5nuzzles

She'll attack anything that is hidden under blankets; such as feet.

XD
I just feign interest and understanding.

wow
Mhm.

Dragone

:P
12Yeah.
Infamous: Any specifics?
i dunno
5its beed hot here too
I found it somewhat boring
i guess he expected an oblivion like game i think
I just bought tf2, portal, a bunch of half life 2 games, and day of defeat:source off ebay for $11
but the story was interesting
They devoted the big six-page obsession thing on GameInformer for the sequel.
So I figured it was good.
I saw that
For liiife.
:P
i want to get border lands later
:P
12Well, it's cool inside.
It was only five bucks with my purchase anyhow.
i just bought the coh expansion
hmnn..
5same
for me I was dumb enough to fall for their advertisement
okays, I think I'm going to go to bed, bye o/
oh yeah.. just found out that the new metroid game is coming out at the end of the month
5you live alondg the coast or like in th middle??
I obly bought it for tf2 though
I dont like any of the other games
without realizing just how few used games I actually buy in a given year
Oh.
12I live near the gulf.
it's good if you buy a lot of games from them
i'm expecting that thing to be quite awesome
12Tampa...
5cool. too bsd about oil spill huh??
I actually don't buy lots of games anymore, but I always buy used unless there's a benefit.
the new metroid game looks pretty awesome based on the poster
cheaper that way
12Yeah...
awwwwww
I'm dying for Reach, but I just spent most of my fund for it at the movies. xD
well its being made by team ninja instead of nintendo so yeah its gona be metroid/ninja gaiden
Despite that I have it preordered
i'm gona get reach as well
we need to party up
Indeed.
Do I have you on Live?
yeah
Just making sure.
oh yeah
and he needs to get reach as well so he can play with us
me too
I enjoy it
Haha, understandable.
but not enough to buy it
rent maybe though
well i like the beta enough to be convinced to buy the game
I rented the first two
Reach is going to explode in popularity, I just know it. This is coming from someone who didn't even want to get Halo 3 because I used to hate the games.
12It didn't come where I live luckly... still sad...
bought the third because of the awesomely fun multiplayer
^ Exactly
And Forge.
and now I just don't play multiplayer like I used to
Forge kept me occupied forever.
i loved the new multiplayer gametype they added
5thats good but yes it is sad.
Network Test, with the gennies
*?
lol i remember playing mario kart on halo
Lolwut?
you never played mario kart on halo?
Was it a game variant?
so like... whats up?
5you have a youtube account??
I used to make race tracks and play them, none called Mario Kart though.
Hell, they even made a Nazi Zombies. xD
12Yeah, but no vids.
well mario kartish
5ok. i have like a few vids but i dont like them
I played a game variant of duck hunt once

Just another obligatory release.
I've lost interest in Call of Duty comppletely
or is that Medal of Honor?
either way
/me 12pokes Majesty and runs away.
Medal of Honor is about to release something for the first time in years
lost interest in war shooters in general
Airborne was only a couple years ago
I think
Ew, Airborne doesn't count.
Nintendo made that, I think.
nah
EA did
I had it for the 360\
Oh, okay.
Well, DICe is making this one.
5http://www.youtube.com/user/Neopets112
Forstibe Engine will be pwnsome.
*frostbite
12I already seached you lol
lol found something kinda funny
pwnsome
Pwnacious D.
first watch this one: it an interview that not really funny but watch the next link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZi6DEJsOJ0&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMtZfW2z9dw
Ah, I've seen that
"You know what, you are just dumb! You are really dumb! For real..."
oh
the rapin' err'body in linkin park thing
Yeah. xD
5ok
"Yo gotta hide your kids, hide yo wives, hide yo husbands 'cause they rapin errbody out here."
lol
12Oh snap...
Ever see the one about the leprechaun?
i find that weird that i found someone today watching that at best buy
Where that Alabama neighborhood is all searching?
lolwut
link us
.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8
wb
hi
has she seen it?
my laptop shipped today
:O
:D
:D
"Who else sees the leprechaun? Yeaaaaaah!"
awesome
meaning it left the factory?
yeah
nice
"My theory is it's casting a shadow... from the other limb."
did you just find that out?
I found out earlier today
"Could be a crackhead, who got ahold of the wrong stuff. Then they told him to go up in a tree..." XD
but I forgot to mention it until just now
ah
well congratulations on your new laptop\
hopefully it will arrive shortly
I think I'll keep the netbook
Probably not the smartest idea to leave a 17 inch laptop running all day
haha
i leave my 15 on all day
Haha, unless you want Dante's Inferno in your house.
ha
5ok
5hiys
holy crap... i went to best buy today and saw an alienware desktop there... that thing sounded like a freakin jet engine
5if he/shes here lol
12:L
/me 12kisses Majesty.
they look like jet engines too
or like something futurustic and awesome
still loading
i wana put a jet engin on my camry
Alienware is actual alient tech we are reverse-engineering. xD
*alien
yeah a guy wanted to get a back ho to dig up a pot of gold
5smiles and does the same
5:)
^ XD
12Rawr.
wow
people actually believe that stuff?
Gotta love black people.
5IM ADINO SAWR RAWR N STUFF
12o.o
What do you mean? It's really there! Didn't you hear all those people going "Yeaaaah!"?
its a shadow... cast of a limb
5http://www.youtube.com/user/Neopets112
5its funny. kinda
"It could be a crackhead.
Got ahold of the wrong stuff, made him climb a tree and play leprechaun.
The best part is the "amateur sketch." Hilarious.
or it could be an irish midget... thats an oddity enough for a black community
12I'm sorry baby, what did you want me to see?
Oh, and the leprechaun hunter.
He was a character.
5the link up there
5lol
12Oh, haha.
5:)
5its funny.................. kinda
12Hehe.
D:
you cant sleep now!
5Crap spyro keeps dying
its only 12oclock
12:O
I have to wake up at 6 tomorrow
you can make it
aww
dentist appointment
=/
you can sleep while they drill
5*cuddles*
XD
I hope there won't be any drilling involved
'Night.
12*cuddlesback*
ask for plenty of novacane or laughing gas
Wisdom teeth?
just a check uo guys
:P
*up
5<:)
aw crap...
I have one on Friday
and their is drilling involved
D:
5:D
have to get my wisdom teeth out soon too
12:3
i have mine in and i never had to get mine taken out
Removing wisdom teeth is just the government's way of dumbing us down for their world domination.
5howls lovingly song
why do you have to have them taken out anyway?
12^-^
I got mine out when I was 16
they told me that was very young
It is.
that few have them out that early
They're not even a problem or even developed usually until like 18.
woooow
I don't have to get mine out
:D
5btw whats ur myspace link thing
12Hang on.
5ok
12*kisses*
5:)
5blushes
Navy requires them out
ah
that makes sense
why does everyone want them out though
for me it was to relieve pain
they weren't growing right
they only have a 10% chance of coming in right
if they don't they will cause mouth infection and annoyance
yeah exactly
At leats they aren't ripped out with pliers and like inserted into out ears like the Middle Ages.
so they have to be removed to prevent both
*our
*least
XD yeah
Although there werne't pliers then.
More like tongs.
The Middle Ages would've sucked so bad
12Uh I need to edit it first.
Ha, ever watch an old SNL skit called Theodoric the Barber?
Of York, lol.
5ok :)
I've never watched SNL actually
oh
wow
perfect comedy duo :o
Random mention, haha.
really
I like him
especially in The Idiot
Maybe because I haven't seen enough of his movies.
he isn't so great anymore
12Before I show you, just wanna let you know that I was joking, and I thought I was never gonna use it...
now he only does chick flicks and crap
Right, and Cheaper By The Dozen. xD
but The Idiot was hilarious
5ok
5:)
I've been meaning to see that.
I think that's what it was called
12http://www.myspace.com/463757201
is it The Idiot?
where he thinks he's black and he has a faithful dog and all that
12Plus Iied about mah age...
12>.<
I think so.
As for recent movies, I think he's good in the Pink Panther.
But that's the only good one in like a decade or more.
haven't seen it actually
Heh, he's the French inspector.
Oh wait
it's called The Jerk
not The Idiot
Oh.
The Idiot is a Dostoyevsky book
LOL I was thinking that.
5LOL ITS FUNNY!!!! dies laughing
woah cool
That's a great movie, by the way.
I loved it.
by the way
12Haha thanks... oh and be careful what you type... you know, little brother...
the poster for The Jerk says it all: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Jerk.jpg
5ok
5yeah
Hohoho, '79.
It hasn't loaded.
hmm
Ah I remember this.
They spoofed it with the black white supremist skit.
/me 12cuddles Majesty
*supremicist
5i never really use face book but im always on ms
on SNL?
Nah, Chapple's show. xD
5cuddles back
ah
By the way, that movie's tagline would never be allowed toda.
*today
XD
haha, no it wouldn't
5Tackles him
12hehe...
5get up
5gets i mean
5lol
/me 12tackles back.
Hahahaha, just learned that Lyndon B. Johnson was well-known for mispronouncing the N word.
5laughs and gets up

0:(
0not cool
Wrong room
10im still on?
10yay
12Yaaay!

3STALKER!
3jk
I heard a song with the most pointless chorus ever on the way home the other day
12<.<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pqC563bX_w
Oh, this'll be good.
the chorus goes "He said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what?" he said "captain!" I said "what you want?!"
It has the Rapper's Delight instrumentals.
"Once in a lifetime, twice a day."
XD
/me 12is happeh.
XD
But yes, can't crack that code he's using
3yes im happeh too
12Green text!
oh, the 80's
This is great. :P

Yeah.
He's my philosophy/poltical advisor. xD
XD
7lol
13pink! eww pink sucks
WOT
Captain
Wot you want?
I sent it to him instead.
Hm... what to do?
no idea
I am also bored
though I should sleep
I said "Captain!"
I haven't gotten enough of it
wot
Hm, I just caught up on sleep.
I'm not tired yet, either.
I had bee caught up
until the last two nights
I hate being a semi insomniav
*insomniac
/me 12is super happeh.
Mhm. Me too... :/
I'm so jealous of the people who are able to just lay down
and fall asleep
13is super doper happeh
and stay asleep
everytime they try'
I know.
It's unfathomable.
Even if I'm active the entire day I still will be unable to sleep.
speaking of insomnia
same here
I hate it
but yeah
Ha, most likely.
our fellow insomniac
Another thing; I'm jealous of those who fall asleep at their keyboards.
me too
I could never fall asleep lke that without letting myself.
I have never done that
I have once
How?
but it was when driving, not at a keyboard
by not sleeping for three days
>.>
Hahahaha.
Oooh.
other than that one time I cannot fall asleep without trying to
and half the time I still can't when I try to
'When I went six days without sleeping, I feel asleep during conversations with people.
I'd be standing up talking and doze off for like 30 seconds.
Hahaha
wow
whats goin on?
He lives!
were those six days by choice or was it just inability to sleep?
XD
By choice.
out of curiosity
To see if I could do it.
were you asleep?
wow
I would never do that to myself for more than a couple days
how long did you sleep when you finally did
and even then
Infamous: I did it piecemeal
only for the sake if all nighters
I'd sleep a few hours here, a few there.
Yeah.
I'd see that it's already almost morning
/me 12almost dies of super happeh
"why bother trying"
Right. Same here.
ive been up 50+ hours once but that was because i couldnt get to sleep because of pneumonia
The past few weeks I've fallen asleep as the sun comes up. xD
i do the same thing all the time
course i work night shift and sleep when i come ome
*home
hi
Mhm.
:D
yeah I used to too
How are you?
/me hugs
hated that so much
I could easily handle 3rd shift.
well enough, and you?
wouldn't have been so bad if the rest of the world also had that sleeping pattern
but at any time when I was awake
Heh, there should be a community of people who all decide to reverse their clocks and see the long-term effects of being nocturnal.
haha
its called a bar
XD
LOL
the english call it a pub
I call it a prison.
heh
you ever been to a bar?
Aye, sir
many times
i havent
"{
Hehe, prison bars.
:P
around here bars are no different than reseraunts really
*restauraunts
There are few places around here that are exclusively bars.
Okies
yeah true
QUICK
It's all "Restaraunt and Pub."
TEST YOUR IQ
"A man builds a house with four rectagular walls, with each wall having a southern exposure. A bear comes along. What color is the bear? Brown, White, Pink, or Black?"
everything is "bar and grill" here
White.
It'd be a polar bear.
Pink
My little bro said brown
Heard it before.
xD
Doesn't count.
Still is funny
Yeah, fer shure.
/me 12pokes Majesty.
haha
that's how it's pronounced with my accent
I SAID CAPTAIN
Really?
pretty much
I adopt and [censored]ize so many accents I've forgotten which is my own.
the accent here is pretty much standard midwest accent
but with a bunch of shortcuts to saying some things
like "fer" instead of "for"
Is "y'all" a staple?
nah
YES
I can tolerate you, then.
only people who want to be southerners say it
saywha
People who want to be ghetto here says y'all.
I have never in my life used the word "y'all"
*say
except maybe in impressions
i hear it every now and then but i dont really notice it right off the bat
13:) i love you too
My cousin goes to college in VA, so when I was there for a week I was berated with y'all and some weird word called "durst."
It mean dare or something
12>.>
"durst"?
hmm
.*means
weird
12:D
"I durst you"
13im waiting for ms to load
12Ok...
youve been dursted
Looked it up.
It's an archaic past tense of dar.
*dare
a few people around here have that Sarah Palin way of speaking
that gets a bit annoying honestly
Haha, that's hilarious.
At least you don't have Bush speakers.
kawaii
haha
also
"To get better alternatives energy, we are going to electrilize the energization industry."
I say "beg" instead of "bag"
Huh, that's odd.
and "dreygon" instead of
"dragon"
So like a paper beg?
yeah
spyro the dreygon
XD
That's at least interesting and not ignorant sounding.
I pronounce the 'a' like an 'e'
I never noticed it until she pointed it out
dam polish tounge
the weird thing is
she only lives 2 hours from me
maybe it is something to do with my polish upbringing
:P
That's very strange.
You'd probably think I talk weird, then.
also she lives in a city
or
near a city
I live in the rural area
Mhm. That's a factor.
so that may account for the slightly different accent
i have the occational southern accent that come up on me every now and then
dont know why though
haha yeah I noticed that when we played Halo
it was barely noticable though
You know Julia Roberts had a Georgia accent before she acted?
yeah
brb
/me is now away - Reason : hiatus
they mention that in Ocean's Twelve
Then later she needed it again and couldn't find it. xD
Right.
when she played a girl who pretended to be herself
interesting twist if you ask me
XD
Mhm. Those are good movies.
they are
especially the first
Ocean's Fourteen is coming, with DeNiro.
I haven't seen the original though
D:
Me either.
the one with Sinatra
DeNiro?
he has ruined his career
MHm.
Why, because of Meet the PArents?
*Parents
I actually liked that movie
Me too.
A lot of peope disagree.
*people
but no, just that he never playd his usual badass roles anymore
*plays
or not badass
but morally grey
Mhm. I agree.
Analyze This and the lot.
yeah
and Taxi Driver
Never saw it.
I'm told that's child abuse.
xD
Scorsese movies are always good if you want a character that you don't know how much you like
The Departed is amazing for exampe
Right.
*example
Scorcese latest, Shutter Island, was amazing.
I still need to see that one
honestly
The Departed was alright. My friend is obsessed.
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors
he always plays complicated roles
He's good /now. /
Titanic days, no.
yeah exactly
he was good from Gangs of New York (also Scorsese) on
Did you like/see Inception yet?
neither
or
no to see
dunno to like
You have to.
It's mandatory.
lol
maybe this weekend
sunday
It was revolutionary, I think. But all Nolan filsm are.
saturday I have a family golf tournament
*films
Ahaha, nice.
What has he directed other than Dark Knight?
Inception, Momento, etc.
Momento was killer.
ah
The Dark Knight, Batman Begins.
The only of his movies I've seen was Dark Knight
I have only seen parts of Batman Begins
I like Batman Begins. For an origins movie it was pretty good standalone.
But yeah, I think he's a must-see from now on.
what are your stands on the spiderman movies?
I like the first two
I like the first two, then it went downhill. 3 was okay.
same
X-Men?
Raimi left, so we have a reboot now. D:
Fist two great
from then on
sucked
X-Men? They were perfect, IMO.
the first two I agree
I liked all three, but Origins was weird.
but the third and Origins
Origins was way too over the top
I liked how Gambit was in it
^ Yeah.
X-Men is my favorite superhero series.
Spiderman is mine
It's what got me into sci-fi and comic books stuff.
but I do like the first couple X-Men
Well, as for heroes with powers, I think the X-Men contend with Spider-Man. Without powers, Batman is the best hero.
QUICK
I need good anime
Hahaha, tell me.
BOMBARD ME
>:C
well
I know nothing of anime, sorry.
I dunno
same here
[censored]
the only anime I watch is Pokemon
xP
I'll come back to you when I'm Japanese.
and yes I do still sometimes watch it
i like full metal alchemist and bleach..
/me is no longer away : Gone for 10 minutes 55 seconds
but very very rarely
Hey, ever notice that in our generation everyone who is moderately intelligent seems to like anime and manga?
I'm talking like 80%.
except me
XD
ah
Me either.
We must be dumb.
must be
cause theres nothing animated thats wortha crap anymore
you know what>
Are we hipsters?
XD
Like, I join writing sites, and EVERYONE there can write and have a good conversation, and they all love anime.
sometimes we kinda act like it
i remember batman when i was a kid.. where did that go
I was raised in counterculture.
LIBERAL!
I'm con, actually. xD
my little group of friends pretty much defined counterculture
Ill have rdx quash you
we would get annoyed at anything that was "overrated"
My best friend is obsessed with anything bohemian or avant-garde.
what is bohemian?
I've heard that word before
whats avant
but never knew what it meant
Yeah, exactly. He's very protective of his little-known music, and would be [censored]ed if anyone else started lstening to it.
ive heard of bohemian rhapsody
ah yeah
mhm
xP
I guess so.
she i9sn't so hab though
*isn't
(bad
*bad
No, no.
/me cannot type in the dark
I think hipsters are kind of like snobs today, so I'd rather not identify myself with them.
yeah
Plus I care little about fashion like they do.
very true
I'll stick with bohemian... eccentric, even. xd
I don't know what I'd call myself
just nerd works
XD
my mom thinks "nerd" means the same as "jerk"
i dont know what you guys are talkin about :P
your mom is a nazi
" Bohemians, in this colloquial use of the word, were associated with unorthodox or anti-establishment political or social viewpoints, which were often expressed through free love, frugality, and/or voluntary poverty."
she sees a really rude person and angrily says "what a nerd"
I reply
"Mom, /I/ am a nerd"
:P
12Rawr.
lol
should be dork or something
Actually, screw bohemian.
i hear girls call a jerk or ahole a dork and it sorta lands flat when i hear it
yeah
Avant-garde suits me better, seeing as I'm not liberal.
haha
whats avant
You like to experminent and push the envelope socially.
ah
You're a trendsetter, and such.
progressive then i guess
*experiment
12Majesty?
You also may or may not have ties to postmodern thought. >_>
what are your views on postmodern thought?
13grr ,yspcae is being stupid
13im here
Hm...
12Mkay.
Can't say I like it's headliners, but...
It has some truth, I think.
yeah
How about you?
13:)
it's something that I really don't know how I feel about
like
13what did u say on my space i couldt i\open the thing
I don't want to look at things from a postmodern viewpoint
12Open what?
but at the same time
13the chat
a lot of it does actually make sense
I think a person's views on it should change as what was once modern becomes post. xD
XD
what are you guys talking about anyway?
isn't the basic idea of postmodernism that the ideas of right and wrong are irrelevant or something
"I adore philoooosophyyyyy."
That was such a great vid.
oh philosophy
12Click online friends then click meh.
so like "if it works do it"
and that's all that matters
or am I wrong still?
Yeah, and what should be done and when it should be done. Some extreme forms are for a very regulating scoiety.
*society
Youve basically got it.
I don't know much to be honest.
well
I really don't care for that way of thinking really
I like to believe that there is always hope for positive improvement
there's always another way so to speak
Me either. I think the ends don't always justify the means, and that humanity will progress without us needing to hatch a master plan.
yeah
and as long as we constantly strive to do what we feel is right, that is all we can do to advance society
no need to take it too far and do "whatever works"
The way I see it is, if we can't progress without killing ourselves, what is worth preserving?
Yeah
I mean, doesn't a person know what do to survive?
that's a very good point
Thanks.
no problem
Infamous, any thoughts?
hm?
bout what
/me gestures to the board.
12Majesty?
You know, ur future.
*our
oh i dunno...
the future of society
We should kill all the minorities. Then the presidents. Then the actors.
XD
After that, Coca Cola will be our new water supply.
THE STORM IS COMIN'
haha
either we'll come to a time whether we will fall back to the way we were and rise back up like the last civilizations before us or we will become advanced to the point where we will actually touch our goals and not have anything else to go to
I worry that we're too advanced already.
think of it as this...
As in, the last thing we need is more inventive ways to kill each other.
I agree completely
there are 5 things that people strive for as they live... in this order...
Haha, in ll the stories about aliens and stuff, they smother us early on because we advance to fast and are like babies playing with nukes.
*all
*too
There's some truth to that.
yeah there is
security, nesessity, relationship, personal goals, personal desires
Are goals that different from desires?
Infamous: now would you put the first in the list as the most important or vice versa?
people will set their bar at one point of this pyramid or annother
in that order
goals are different as they are long term
desires being shorter term
Oh, good point.
desires can be achieved more easily basically
job vs cash handout
whereas goals you continue to strive for
Can we all agree that people are way too selfish for their own good?
people in general?
Yeah.
in general yeah
its what people will do to acheive those things to get those 2 last steps to their happiness
but I don't feel all people are too selfish
people tend to be selfish but thats part of this type of society
No, not all. There are a /ton/ of factors that ome into to whether ot not they are on their way to altruism or heading the other way,
*come, or
people are raised with the notion that you can have this and make this, not that this society is a system that you are a part of and has to work in tandom with annother to make it work well
Enviroment, personality, parenting, societal pressures, and all of that shape you more than you'd think.
Infamous: Yeah, right.
yeah I agree
No sarcasm.
thats the environment part of the equation
*environment
there is also a personal part that'll take place
Heh, now who thinks some are conceived as what we'd call "evil"?
you can choose a path ,so to speak, that can and will alter you in the way you think at one point or annother
/me nods.
evil is relative
I don't believe that
Me either.
that people are concieved evil
But yeah, that's why I quoted it, Infamous.
From an amoral standpoint, it's be moot.
*it'd
only in extreme cases is an act considered truly evil
anyone can agree that ending a life for no apperent reason is bad
Not everyone.
but few can agree on whether ending it /for/ a reason is bad
well.. ok now that i think about it yeah...
Some would consider it their right to be able to kill anyone they pleased.
but to they have sane autonomy
Maybe. Could just have a terrible ego and no respect for human life.
of which has concious empathy and reasonable intellegence
but where does this lack of respect come from
that's what I wonder
Having their own life treated as worthless.
/me shrugs.
there are those with anti-social personality disorders
who do not see past their own eyes
Mhm. Megalomania.
I actually read an article a few days back about social intellignece
*intelligence
they think for themselves, breath for themselves and judge for themselves
Infamous: Right.
you have a hotpocket disorder
basically
megalomania?
thought that was a delusion of grandeur or something
/me googles megalomania
Yes, like all the crazy villains on TV. xD
nah, I was just starting my summary with the word "basically"
:P
Emperor Zurg in Buzz Lightyear
so ayway this'll take me a sec to type
delusion not illusion
Or that
No opposition.
if you didnt have the delusion of granduer then youd be God himself basically
antisocial is different
Mhm.
anti social is surviveing as one instead of as in a group with a bit of rage thrown in
basically everybody has a social intelligence, which is the ability to understand how to treat social situations, and how to view other people, basically a scale of empathy vs. a complete lack of understanding of other people
although with personality disorders there is a high chance of having multiple disorders
and this social intelligence can cause very sever personality disorders
well it is pretty well accepted
I just found it interesting
wait...
Most people with cults have narcisstic personality disorder
Have the artcile perchance?
*article
no....
I'd have to find it
I mean, who make cults
people with cults probably have delusions, dementia or what not or a megalomatic desire
*cult
narcissistic personality disorder is not really bad as it is annoying
/me doesn't know of a cult where the leader wasn't showing serious signs of NPD
which is why he [censored]es me off
And megalomania and stuff
I mean, there are cult heads who don't allow the members to have any physical contact at all, yet he or she can sexually abuse anyone within that they want. They hinge on a very loose sense of standards.
You kinda have to in order to be a good cult leader
Hai :o
No, not really.
he sorta makes me think he is cause most things he talks about tend to revolve around himself
Thanks, dude.
:o
no problem
Lol, I remember when I first encountered what they call "emotional intelligence."
I thought it was BS. Not sure now.
I don't think it's BS at all
I did some digging like the creep I am, and saw evidence of him being an annoying tagalong.
i thought emotional intelligence was empathy
Not tought at all.
some people don't handle emotional situations as well as others
*tough
hi
Empathy is pretty broad. I mean, we're not even sure how it works.
Ever see Pwoder?
*Powder
to immagin in the eyes of the other?
:o
isnt that what empathy is?
:)
Well, further, even. To actually experience another's emotions.
yeah
ah
The brain sure is complicated :x
anyone can put themselves in another's shoes
That's why I use Pwoder as an example, since he had that ability.
*Pwoder
*POWDER
never heard of powder
XD
but few can actually try to share the emotions
/me nods.
Share the emotions/
?*
ever watch king of the hill
you see quite a few personality flaws within the characters in that show
I've seen KotH.
not just understand
Funny show.
but also feel
sure they can
Sometimes some people can do that in some situations
Never heard of anyone that can do that with everyone even most of the time
well no
but some people are more prone to show it at all than others
I thinkwe can be empathetic to the best of our ability, but in order to actual feel their emotions we would have to literally be them.
Because all the little nuances would have to be exactly the same for us to feel exactly how another does.
true
No one can relate to anyone completely
women tend to work at empathy much better than men
so basically it's impossible to be truly empathetic is what we're saying?
Yes.
just to do the best we can
But what we can do is usually enough,.
Funny, that Twilight Zone explored this a lot.
*Zone book
In the field of management, though, you really need to be able to figure out why the people who work for you are motivated to do what they're doing
Don Corelone had a pretty good quote on that in The Godfather II
Ooh
The Godfather
:P I think I know.
great films
They're okay
/me watched them once and liked them
I've only watched the first.
/me has the boxed set of the trilogy
/me has strange tastes in movies though
"this is just a big shti sandwhich.... and we all gotta takea bite"
:P
then*
yeah
understanding motivation is a huge part of empathy
oi.... you guys and your philosophy have finally woke me up and made me hungry...
haha
it's made me want to stay awake
and keep talking about it
:P
]though I really need sleep
:P
:P
:P
:P
Alrighty.
:D
And figuring out that motivation will make your job easier
Like, you'll know what approaches to take
Mhm.
It's like when actors get in character once they undertsand the motives.
*understand
yepyep
Lean on Me was a pretty good movie
And I was thinking about that thing about understanding motives throughout the movie
What's its premise?
Inner city school that's about to be taken over by the state, and a principle has a year to get it and its students into shape
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8GcPWyE2k here's a clip
inb4 fail
Why is it being taken over? Bad management?
Hehe, Freeman.
It was just statistically the worst school in the state
gotta have a road built on it
Hey, that's me
^ Lol.
02hm
02everything went down
02wonderful
/me is away: afk
:D
Watch the movie
I'm gonna.
Morgan's character reminds me of my dad. xD
Not his rage, but his method.
That style usually doesn't work unless you're dealing with people who have to deal with you
LOL at the end of the vid.
Yeah, I know.
/me couldn't run student government meetings like that >.>
well hey I think I'm going to go to bed

Okay, night.

Since I just remembered that you people might not be fond of being on fire D:
i had a second degreeburn from an overheated engine that blew up in my face once
I had a 3rd degree from a soldering gun
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCtBkDebK-s&feature=related
not fun
not ur face i hope
It was on my hand
Very small area, not much pain
But... it was visibly cooked
i was in the car with a friend of mine in hs when the car flipped and my hand went through the sun roof
yeah pain of any kind isn't fun
and hands are necessary
So what happened to your hand?
BAIBAI
lacerated in 3 places, nearly severing the tendon in my middle finger, exposing the nerves. was in a cast for a month to keep the tendon from snapping
Wow
I don't think I've ever done something that painful to myself

4lol
:D
\o/
Anyways, I found this: http://www.gossipgamers.com/amazing-warhammer-40-000-dreadnought-pc-case-mod/
4going to it now
hi Ari ^^
Good o!
I think everyone needs to have a lesbian girlfriend at least once
Especially lesbians, but I mean, other people too
not my thing
I mean, just for the life experience
i dunno i think id get jealous of the fact they liked girls more than me
lol
/me always wanted to date one specific girl
but she got engaged
> .>
A guy was cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, but his girlfriend was also cheating on him with that same girl
And everyone married each other and lived happily ever after
or the guy that wasn't gay but kept banging his cell mate after he got out of prison and it was ruining his marriage
lolol
If I went to prison, I don't think I would look up any of my prison friends on the outside
what prison friends..
The dudes you roll with
one of the rules in prison is you don't have friends you have protection but no ones a friend
everyone will kill you if they have to
:o
Sounds like someone's been to prison :o
nope
trust me if i went to prison i wouldn't walk out alive
xD
yet one more reason to avoid it altogether
it wasn't cus of that
I dun remember
he got into a fight at a bar and hospitalized some guy that drank his beer
he got sent to jail for a while
and then was on probation I think
I still love him though
he's adorable
xD
yes'm
oh shit
I haven't texted him in almost 3 days
RAIN
BAD RAIN
he probably thinks i died or something
oh crap
I cursed
rawr
/me sighs
my computer froze on me, twice >_>
Curly: Did it freeze because it overheated? :o
I'm not sure
I think it might have
I might need another fan
the cpu and gpu were fine, but there's one heatsink that's really hot
and I'm not sure what it is
maybe one of the bridges
either way, my computer froze and then froze again when I rebooted :S
i had that going on all day yesterday
it seems fixed for the moment
am I forgiven?
oh god!
:3
lol
okies :3
yay
I'm still wondering if I can put my computer in a fish tank >.>
well the fans were as old as the case 6 or 8 years so i replaced them and put an additional one in
it seems to be working
so im hoping it stays stable
no issues since i replaced them
get a temperature monitoring program
like speedfan or something
i have the case temp
its running a tad hot
but stable
the case temp or the cpu temp? because if the case temp is hot, then the cpu temp must be horrible :X
I don't know how, but they did.
although, some mobos might not be able to handle that
I read that there are parts that might break down after a few days on some mother boards
kk i installed the mainboard tools for monitoring brb have to reboot

oh kristen
my bad
12No..
i don't give affection to ppl i don't care about but when i do im an open book to them and am very intense
12<.<
and socionics is really complicated looking at this article >_>
me?
12NOOOOOOO........
/me gives up on reading it
lol i give up
idk who
Yeah, MBTI is enough for me
12What?
lol
apparently socionics isn't widely supported as a scientific theory
idk
who u love
12Kristen?
yeah
12You there?
i said that and u said no
oi
its like trying to follow something strictly
Socionics is pseudo-science
and then are given maslows
heirachy
yeah
hierarchy
*
poor cynder captured by pirates
im here
Socionics for me has about as much credibility as string theory
well, it looks like socionics could have some potentional but nobody's bothered to standardize it
and now she's captured by gaul
yipee <.<
12:)
not that I even really understand what I'm reading >_>
why don't you think string theory is credible it explains a lot if they could only observe it
I don't think string theory is credible either
because for string theory to exist you have to assume the laws of physics are flexible
/me 12jumps on Kristen.
kristen i stopped after the executioner
yes
which I don't think they are
Just because something sounds complex and uses a lot of technical terms doesn't mean it has any credibility
just that scientists haven't been able to pin it down enough for it to be unrandomized
randomness is only lack of understanding
physics may not be the same in every universe so they have to be flexible somewhat
I don't care for any of this "Wouldn't it be cool if ...." kind of science, because it's not science
universes are seperate from each other
yes
so one system of physics has nothing to do with another
that doesn't make physics flexible within one universe
String theory is "wouldn't it be cool if" pseudo-science
but if phisics wasn't flixeible it would be the same in every universe
im here
string theory isn't about seperate universes but connected alternate universes
ok
did u hear me?
yes
physics is not one thing
one universe has one physics system while another universe has another
ok
but as a system
if it was inflexible
you can't talk about physics as a whole when you're talking about seperate universes
it would be a constant wherever
yeah
ok
that's like saying the laws of the road are flexible because in Canada it's one thing but in the States it's another
well i'm off, talk to u ppls later
k
byr
that just means law is flexible

Actually, my biggest issue is with M-theory, which is a suppliment of string theory
brb
The whole 11-dimensions thing
I thought the 11 dimensions thing was a geometric theory
or is that something else
Basically, it's not science if the theory starts out as "wouldn't it be cool if"
That's not science :(
You need evidence and testability and scientific method and all that good stuff
Or it's not science, it's religion

10brb
who took my cyanide?
XD
ha
thats his name now
on xbox live
cyanide?
Hahaha
yeah
10back
that's awesome
I haven't been on since he added me
12Yaaay!
haha, he sort of does
but at the same time it seems like he does it as a joke
10u still on myspace
wish he would be more casual about it though and not try to be a hard ass
12Yeah.
10ok
yeah but it was like over night when he changed though...
yeah it was
i was like wtf is wrong bud
all of a sudden he was acting like a jerk
now he's a funny jerk
cause he started going off on me
but still not like he used to be either
chances are is that he found a clich in school that is fitting in with
I'm actually wondering if it's more the opposite
like he's all [censored]ed about everyone at his school or something
but then again
he seems to rigid to and less passive to not be with some sort of group in my opinion
yeah true
when we first met him he was more like an outcast
he was more carefree, but at the same time a little lonely almost
got on xbox live so i could play with him but he hasnt showed up
were you there the night when that tornado was at his house and he was all worried?
it was around then when he changed
I haven't been on xbox live in forever
i think
i remember him saying stuff about a tornado or storm or something
yeah he was freaking out and he wouldn't say why
and eventually he said a tornado was coming his way and signed out
have you ever noticed how he never talks about his irl life?
yeah
he's talked about how he feels about his family once to me
hmm
i dont remember that
it was just me and him
I remember that
you might have been there
what did he say
but if you were you were asleep or something
he said that he's from one of those huge religious families and he can't stand his parents for it
hmm
because he isn't religious at all
hmm
like he said he feels like the outcast in the family
like he can't relate to any of the others
hey
that was all he really said though
GOOD EVENING.
You still all crazy happy?
wow change of mood like adrenaline to the heart
:P
LMFAO....nah not right now :(
:(
:|
you were crazy last night
wait she was on last night?
indeed.
on Gmail
ah
all of a sudden a window pops up
and she says
"EVERYBODY LOVES BOOBS"
lol
XD
I know how to paint now!
sorta
haha
on a computer?
:P
painted my cat
no
XD really?
PAINT YOUR MAN BOOBS
real paint
ha
yes I doooooo
hahaha
a week from Monday
ah
i need a sammach
12Kristen?
/me is now away - Reason : Baby Baby OHHHH!!!!
/me is now away - Reason : Baby Baby OHHHH!!!!
:O
10yeah im here
10OK...... i dont want to know
12Baby?
10yeah
12Umm...
so bored...\
/me is no longer away : Gone for 20 minutes 23 seconds
/me is no longer away : Gone for 20 minutes 23 seconds
/me is bored too
/me likes cheese
haha
cheese is good
you made a sammich?
yeah
cheese is a plug
about 3 grilled cheeses
XD nice
get some prune juice or cabage
I had 2 cheese and ham hot pockets earlier
[censored] those were good
the cheese in hot pockets taste a little different
maybe so
but still good
probably
she must be behind on sleep I imagine
if shes like me after walmart duty then yes
haha
way too early?
yeah... she should at least start around 2 or 3
she only gets 6 hours of sleep most nights
thats too much
I like to get 8
:P
/me is lazy
i sometiems get 12
if its on a monday
plus if I stay up too late it's like my body doesn't want to fall asleep
holy crap
that makes sense though
because the other days of the week you don't sleep much at all
around this time everynight is when i want to go to sleep
/me loves not having a job, if she had one she'd want a nighttime one
ha
might suit ya
nighttime jobs suck for people like me
but for you
it might just work
:P
10nvm
10...
12Paint!
ill let you guess
haha
not a nightshift zombie like me
hm?
she can be alive at night
10nvm

10Kristen hates justin bieber
I'm ANGRY in the mornings

I feel peaceful in the mornings
look up on youtube "heavy bieber"
its funny
yeah I don't come on until around 9:45, my time

she was online when I first got home
then instantly became idle
12You were listening to BABEH BABEH BABEH OHHHH
normally when she falls asleep at her keyboard it's around now

/inside joke
/me gets kicked in the face
O.o
...lol
brb
OH MY GODDDDD MY MOM GOT ME THESE TWISTY PENCIL THINGS THEY'RE AMAZING
<3

/me listens to 90s music and draws defective owls
blarg
:D
now I am going to draw a cat with pikachu ears
lol
I'll probably just fall asleep agani

HOLY[censored]
maybe you need sleep
since you fell asleep so early
only rests
:P
lol
so I'm a female Edward Cullen?
ew
XDDDD
XD
any of you seen the parody movie yet? I wanna see it by this weekend
Can't really go to midnight showings of anything if I have to work at 8 every morning
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE IT A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR YOUR HATE
;D
lol
I don't really HATE Twilight
I just dislike it and like making fun of it :P
:P
its that she dislikes it with every bane in her being
:P
hmm
I wonder if that movie will still be in theaers in a week and a half
probably
w00t
/me discovered chocolate covered bacon
:)
GOD why does everyone assume that younger people like chocolate
:(
but bacon
i like chocolate
I like chocolate a lot
and bacon even more
mixed?
hmmm
I never tried it
I just discovered it
I'll just have to find out
ah
I assume that everyone likes bacon and chocolate
Not just younger people
Everyone
:(
Everyone likes bacon / chocolate unless stated otherwise
:3
:o
:D?
:(
noooooooo
:( ------> *upside down machine* --------> :)
?
:D
:D?
/me only has two hours tonight to not be bummed out but isn't counting on it
hmmm
Watch stand up comedy
That helps me whenever I feel depressed
lol
nah
well
/me is enjoying this 90s emo mix so far so that helps a little
just listen to happy music
...or emo music
:P
:P
whatever works
anywho
Or talk to hot guys that you're interested in
*girls
Or girls, I dunno
/me is almost falling asleep
I haven't had time to look for new music lately I was too busy being bored and guiltily watching soap oepras to do so
night peoples
gnite
/me also assumes that people are heterosexual unless they say otherwise
If I assume people are straight and they're gay, it usually ends up better than if I assume they're gay and they're straight
lol
I'm not one to freak out and go OMG U OFFENDED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:P
Or bisexual or pansexual or one of those other flavors
Yeah, a lot of people are like that
"flavors" lol
I get offended when people are easily offended though, too many people these days are easily offended and it requires an expert in diplomacy to even operate in today's world
yeah, whenever I'm trying to make new friends I like NEVER state my opinions or views on ANYTHING
:'D
Hehe
and I ESPECIALLY never make my mean vegan jokes until I know it's someone that eats meat
Yeah, I'm in the same baot
I'd be a vegan if meat wasn't so darn tastey
people need to get over themselves
Yeah :/
especially if they're on the internet oversensitive people dont belong on the internet
Exactly
one of my friends had a breakdown coz I said I didn't like Nickleback
it's like REALLY CMON GIRL
Haha, yeah
Haven't experienced that
I guess it's emotionalism or something
Or maybe I'm too intellectually honest and people know how I feel about things, maybe I need to hide my opinions a bit better
lol mhm
It's the INTJ in me though
http://typelogic.com/intj.html
'Anyone considered to be "slacking," including superiors, will lose their respect -- and will generally be made aware of this'
:3
And KE$HA likes my beard :3
LOL
I wish I could be more like the guy on that clip on my Facebook profile
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM8GcPWyE2k
/me thinks schools need a little bit of that guy
or principal
I always forget
principal
idk since I don't go to school :P
kk
:O
homeschool?
yeah
Or are you too cool for school?
Oh
/me did that
I have no idea what form of school I'll be doing this year
I have no intention of doing any school after I get a diploma though
My student gov. vice president was homeschooled too :3
sooooooo
/me always gets giggles when people say that homeschoolers don't know how to deal with people :3
lol
it's not that I dont know how to deal with people I just don't think it's worth it to waste so many hours and wake up so early all the time when I can get [censored] done faster and on my own schedule at home
I'm already kind of got my own thing going on I'm home alone most the day so I have the time to myself and I'm already pretty close to having an actual task for the job I want
I thought school was a waste of time
College is nice though, because they can print out pieces of paper saying that you accomplished something
brb
kk
back
hmmmm well college isnt really a necessity to what I wanna do
:3
What do you want to do?
music video editing
it'd be different if it was movie editing but I'm not interested in huge stuff like that
I am currently drawing a cat with red eyes a purple nose, yellow year insides, green fur tufts and legs, orange sideburns and a green and orange striped tail
I think I'll make the rest blue
his name shall be Druggles
:D

I just got back from school shopping

Hi where!
xD
I've seen documentaries on it, but never talked to anyone about it
its a where
Yeah I expected it to suck from what I heard from the documentaries
but it really doesn't
:o
Most of the people there are nice and it's not bad work
/me hugs
12 Hello, Things and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
Well, I suppose if everyone else helps create a nice environment, it wouldn't be too bad
^^
/me cuddles Things too.
:o
:D
:D
So much love in this channel.
Shining lasers at people should be a felony >:|
:o
/me nods
Like a class C felony though
It's not?
As in, it's not already a felony
?
It is if you shine them at Airplanes
And people while they are driving I think
I thought that it would be to do it to anyone at all
Seeing as they warn you not to look into them, on the packaging.
And logically, shining it into someone else's eyes would be bad.
:p
.: Should be crime, would be surprised if it's not already
soooo
I just got a really interesting PM on Facebook >.>
"You need to remember why you are in the position you are in and not use it as a power trip. Other than that I think you are a pretty cool guy. Hope sga [student government] is great this year."
And I was liek
Baby baby baby OHHHH
But I didn't say that
I said "umm.... thanks :)" and then ".... wait, what part am I power tripping over?"
and he said "Well i just remember the whole deal with Ms Rian and how you said that this was your job and so on when she made the whole shabang"
And I was like uhhhhhhhhhhh.......
People are wierd
Guess who commented on my youtube profile
Doppel
:o
God
I saw that actually
it's her bf he has the right to stalk
I was bored and browsing youtube and wanted to watch your video of peaches and I saw that
:P
"Are you still made about my comment a long time ago?" --- No, but I never really liked you anyways so stop trying to talk to me
I was actually about to type something
/me had the query window open and everything
And I've been meaning to point that out
But I keep forgetting
hehe
Or
"Hey look! It's Cynder! *runs*"
XD
I like that one
They even making another spyro game anyone know?
eww Spyro
I dunno
it's one of the last games on my radar honestly
:P
ohhh
I forgot Aura told me
They've been "making another game" for a long time now
wat
But no one seems to have any information about it
lol
but he hasn't been able to get a hold of him last time he called
I wish I had a stalker
O.o
Would be a nice self-esteem boost
wat
o.O
Aura sent me a message about it
xD
why would you want a stalker?
She's working in the video game field
You do not want a stalker like Doppel
Well, maybe a part time stalker
XD
Doppel will draw you in several fantasies
I thought Aura24 was like 13
Someone who likes everything I post on Facebook and is a little creepy
o.O
But not *too* creepy
Aura is 18 I think
Oh, right
She just started College
still kind of young to be in the field though
she usually tells me anything that gets passed her way
So all she told you was "they're making a new Spyro game"?
We've known that for like, ever
no she sent me stuff that just kinda points to little things
lol, like Crash Bandicoot needs any more screwing up
and that the next game maintains LoS universe but still goes in a new direction or something
whozzat
I don't see where they can go with the LoS universe after defeating the big bad guy
make a new Big Bad
easy
:P
and make it look like s/he existed all along
idk if the story is any the same
Yeah, another purple dragon who was prophesized to destroy the world
all she said was they were maintaining the characters
like Davy Jones on Pirates of the Caribbean
It would make perfect sense, just like the first three LoS games
lol
Characters like, personalities and everything?
the next one has Blackbeard in it :D
[censored] it
WOHOOO
I hate Spyro's personality
He's boring
f u c k ?
That's ok, that's why God made fanfiction
ooh
XD
I was gonna say
:P
Yeah, unless they make some major changes I'm not going to be buying the next game
anyways the next PotC has blackbeard in it :D
we could rent it for fun though
No
That would cost money
I like money
lol
/me has enough money not to care
Screw you
:(
but but but
:D
renting the Twilight movies costed money too
and that was fun
lol
My activision "friend"?
true...
besides
it would be my money
because it was worth her rediculing every scene I bet
:P
But I didn't pay for them
You did
when I say "we could rent" I mean I pay
:P
I'm the bf
it's my job
In that case, if you want to waste your time on a guararnteed [censored] game, be my guest
D:
XD
more money for me
I want us to
it would be fun to mock
Lol
you should have seen me at the Eclipse movie
it was funny
Screw that id get it first
XD
No
at a drive in
okay now that's just wrong
and I only went for the second movie
Why? :P
because they show two movies
Stephanie Meyer actually gets money that way :P
OH
and I didn't pay for it
-caps
so it was fun to make fun of the whole thing
OH, huh?
:P
my sister kept telling me to shut up
Shut up
but I just got louder
I held down the shift key too long
/me is planning on visiting Vancouver in the winter
what's in Vancouver?
Canadians
and that's about it\
Besides them
:P
XD
syrup
hockey
mhm

Curly is in Vancouver
You're going to visit Curly?
o.o
If I go up there, sure
I've still never met anyone from the internet in person
cept me
even though Mage lives like half an hour from me
but you met me irl before the internet
you're only on here because of me
:P
well... yeah
but I used to be on a Bionicle forum!
so still internets-y
well wb my friend
Activision came by while you were gone
they said to meet them in the dark alleyway when you get the chance
Oh really?
and they said to go alone and unarmed
Hmmm
I think they're going to torture you with Cynder
But I'm not sure
XD
Oh [censored]
But i think that since they did lie to me and if they are making another game that they should give me it before anyone else
Or something bad might happens
/me takes a puff of a cigar
Something very bad
XD
Not possible
Yes possible
I actually smoke cigars. :C
Jerk
also
Only two still stalk me
:P
Impropable
I'm no stalker
:P
just a clingy bf
/me takes an M16 to the stalkers
I am
orlynao
hey now
you can shoot Doppel, but you can't shoot me
Oh guess what I did today
What?
I was looking at vacuums at Walmart
And there was this weird looking green one
and you asked it why it's green?
XD no
I would have
:P
I was about to say it looked like some kind of alien technology before I stopped myself and realized I sounded like you

I don't think I've ever met anyone named Frank
I'm gonna go with John
ctually....

Vancouver is full of liberal hippies, you will like it therew.
Plus its a beautiful city.

I know, but sometimes they fake the url and purposely put tinypic on there.
Dude, that is beat-burglard-over-the-head worthy.
*burglars
Yeah, also investigate colleges
theres BCIT and UFV there
maybe some others as well.
I dont know how they rank compared to others.
I'm also kind of interested in exploring
Vancouver seems like a fun place to explore
/me paddles the chat.
ouch
/me takes away everyone's op
/me never had op to begin with.
If you enjoy outdoor activities its the best place in the world.

Eh, the only decent picture on FB I could find:

I still think BC is the best place in the world if you like the outdoors.
(You're just gonna take it from me when I revel in my power.
/me wants to feel special

Oh, what a surprise.
It's illegal in BC?

/me is very flexible and responsive to their needs
:o
“I couldn’t be more satisfied.”
--Jim Armiak, Marathon Petroleum Company LLC
:3
:o
/me waits for SOMEONE to make the joke..
I'm sure it's going through everyone's minds
Don't worry]
/me clicks on Rigging & Erectros
:o
:o
>.>
I wonder if they know that I exist :o
:o
/me is one of the safest self-performing companies in the US
/me facepalms. >.>
/me is environmentally certified :D
/me has experience erecting thousands of turbines from various manufacturers
o.0
Umm
:3
haha
LK, please tell me we're not the only sick-minded people here.
Sick minded?
:o
/me was talking about all the things I'm not good at that they say I'm good at :o
And
CURLY!
heys <3
:D
I'm staying up all night today :o
Oh, guess what!
YAY
Curly: Gonna go to ....... arg
Curly: Gonna go to Vancouver in the winter
/me leans in real close in whisper mode
That's in Canada
:O
WB Curly
hey DT ^^
thanks, I hit the wrong button >.>
hey, we logged in at the same time o:
And I'm pretty sure that Canada is in the United States
/me runs!
*runs* *runs* *runs*
I'm kind of tipsy again >.>
Uh oh
/me ran over here
/me went to a bar and didn't order alcohol but they gave free shots so she just drank it :x
:x
it tasted like jello :o
mmmmmmmmm
Poor sweet innocent Curly D:
also, there's a Vancouver in Washington :p
How much tipsy? :o
not very
it was only one shot
Oh
and it wasn't very strong
I'm gonna have to go up there and keep an eye on you!
Well, maybe not, because that would be gross
Could lead to infections and stuff
I'm not going to throw up or anything >.>
kk
I drank a half bottle of Crown Royal before
Didn't even get tipsy :/
I was like 12 though
/me doesn't recommend doing that when you're 12
/me once (accidentally) drank punch with rum. :o
:o
LOL
I think the first time I really drank anything was when I was 14
But yeah, drugs are bad, no drugs >:|
i'm drinking right now
sauvignon blanc
yay!! :D
Soo, yeah
:3
/me is a party pooper
lol
Curly: So, you sure you wanna hang out with me? I'm gonna be all like, nooo, don't do that :o
sure ^^
how long are you going to be up here?
/me will be Curly's conscious :3
I'm not sure
I don't need a conscience :O
I know you don't need one, but there I will be nonetheless
/me licks Curly
/me goes wherever fun is as long as it doesn't kill her or anybody else
well
I try anyway >.>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47r-0VlvkzM
It'll be like that :3
/me looks forward to walking the mean streets of Vancouver with Curly
/me needs to get his passport renewed
/me hasn't been to Canada before
Only place I've ever been to is China and whatever countries I flew over to get to China
Sooooooooo
I guess, technically, I've been to Russia and Mongolia :o
Curly: Does it count if you just fly over?
um
I wouldn't say so
Awww
Curly: Also, can I say I've been to California if I didn't step outside the airport?
But I was actually on the ground? :o
mm... maybe partially
/me is skeptical
Hi!

mmm... I want to go to sleep already >.>

Oh wow, it's already 2am!
I just thought that was a funny comment.
>.>
I'm not even hairy D:
Except on my head
lol
:o
;)
:o
:o
fffff
/me fail'd
:(
missed :p
I wont this time.
/me shoots Curly again
>:D
DX
/me bandaids Curly's face up :)//(::[:D]::)
:D
(::[:(]::)
D:
/me removes the bullets first
its funny how those pirate bay founders deny any activity in the site
the main programmer says he never did anything for the site
they did?
and only acted as a spokesperson
I thought they just said they don't have anything to do with the illegal torrents
I thought they'd just be denying any involvement in illegal activities on it?
lol hivemind Curly
No, Peter Sunde said he only acted as a spokesperson for the site and never did any of the programming
when he was the lead programmer....
and server manager.
why would he deny that? that seems weird
Everyone knows that they made the site for illegal file sharing
And it's not like he'd go and say 'Yeah, I made it for illegal file sharing.'
Curly, because he doesnt want to go to prison.
but what's wrong with programming a torrent sharing website?
Hes trying to distance himself from the activites
and the letters he sent back to anti priacy companies insulting them
technically a torrent site doesnt hold anything illegal
but it does facilliate copyright infrigment
but nothing more than what google can do.
It obvious everyone knows that the site was made for sharing copyrighted material and peter was the lead programmer
but they need to prove that in court.
which is hard.
unless he personally put torrents on the website himself I can't see how he could be liable
refusing to remove copyrighted torrents
so he was aware of the activities but let it go anyways.
oh. that might be more shakey
although i dont know how the laws in sweden are
in usa they have the DCMA
which means if you send them a notice they must comply
but they are not bound by that.
in court they were obviously trying to get out on a technicality, but it bit them on the butt and they got sued.
anyways bed time, gnite.
But why go through all that, trying to find who's responsible, while the website still runs? Just shut it down!
Brb
how do you shut down a website without justifying yourself? >.>
I think there's about 2,000+ links on that website to justify it.
200,000+ actually.
/me was aiming too low.
/me probably still is.
but Google has tons of links to pirated material too
and they haven't done anything about it
3.065.055 torrents.
According to the main page.
that doesn't mean they're all illegal
although most of them probably are >.>
No, but the vast majority of them are.
/me has no big issue with piracy herself
And google doesn't manage the sites they link to, Curly.
they can block them though
Whereas TPB manages what's on their site.
and they haven't done that have they :O
they haven't even tried
Google's anti-censorship though
which I like
even if that means not blocking the bad things >.>
although I don't care about piracy one way or the other :X
i suppose it's up to you to do the right thing in the end.
which is? >.>
Not to break the law.
I don't think the law is the be all end all
Of course, one could argue that current laws need changing.
Exactly, Curly.
alright I am going to sleep
this night has sucked anyway
:/
Good night, LightLie! D:
/me gives the LightLie a kiss on the forehead and hopes she has naughty dreams of niceness :o
D:
I got distracted by the dumb Wikipedia article about Pirate Bay :(
/me huggles the Curly and gives her a kiss on the forehead too!
*:O
:3
Too slow Curly.
D:
apparently :(
nini
Sleep well D:
O_o
/me noms the numbers by the number!
:D
mmm... *just thought of a new thing to stress over*
D:
/me delays leaving to fix Curly
I went to apply somewhere today, but I didn't think at all about the interview and now I need to get some time to investigate the company and the store >_>
Right.
:o
so how am I supposed to find time for that >_<
D:
/me doesn't know \:O/
yeah, I'm just ranting now :X
/me gives Curly cuddles and hope that they suffice :X
lol, thanks ^^ *hugs back*
:D
I really have to be off now though, so I'll talk to you later D:
/me snuggles up to the Curly as well! :3
okay, bye o/
o/

Icy, you sly dog.
lol
12Well, you know me!
12;D
12I need my own sitcom.
that'd be interesting
Dude, I totally agree.
We could call it "Icy: Said The Blind Man."
12lol.
it could be called The Adventures of Icy
Or The Ballad of Ghey Icy.
12Ceiling Icy is watching you... ya know...
lol
12Lol Ghey Icy.
/me 12changes his last name to "Ghey"

neeeeahhwwn
12I killedmy first person at 6 years old... those were the days.
O.O
Sure they could.
But that's rare.
I killed my mom by cutting my way out of her womb with a cutlass.
Mary Bell was a 10 year old girl who murdered two little kids
So I esssentially kill at one day old.
look at Esther
she killed 2 ppl
daaaaaahreeeee
12I killed 19
12;D
Dude, I killed Esther and Mary Bell right after their murders.
lol
How are you? :o
Mary Bell is 53 right now
Psh, that's what they want you to think.
lol
It's really a genetic copy.
Or a robot.
R2D2
What an awful thing to say.
I know, right? D:
Erm, pretty good. You?
12A CLONE TROOPER!?
Fine thanks.
I had my first job interview today.
Oh, how'd it go?
12The fact that Bobba is a clone is still hard to grasp.
Mary Bell's mother was a prostitute
12So am I!
Good and bad. They liked my application, but were fully staffed. They'd only need me on one day, and that's a maybe.
lol
It is.
Where'd your apply to?
A big place, or just local?
12Tripp: Basement... now...
Just local, like within walking distance. It's a store on an apple orchard.

12FOOTBALL

I'm just tired today, brain's not working. XD
Haha. Well, does it have enough fuel?
12Tripp: I love you!
No, I need to fill it up. :P
ok...
They need to make something handheld to wake you up that distributes a harmless shcok that jolts you awake.
*shock
Haha, I need that for doing my essays.
"Gentleman, who would like to light some fireworks I jsut found in the men's bathroom?"
12MEN!

"Not entirely true. You see, unfortunately, most of the Nazis here only speak German. So we are experiencing a lack of Grammar Nazis around here that speak and write in English; however, we are actively recruiting new members. Maybe you want to apply?"
its totally retarded
luckily we dont have verizon in canada.

12Do you really wanna live near me?

No thank you, Icy.
I know the earth is round, you moron
12You'll learn to love me, they all do.

Exams ...
12So... Swaffle..
12Do you guys think I'm a bad person?
No.
/me wants to hug Rain :P
Sinner? Yes. But we're all sinners. Bad? No.
lol
12>.>
Plus it's only human to make mistakes, if that's any consolation
Indeed.
12Yeah, but I did something very bad...
12<.<
All sins are taken at the same level. Lying is the same level as rape or murder.
That's why forgiveness exists.
12*sigh*
I'm here to help you if you need any.
I've helped many people.
12KIDDY LAND
Hello, S.R.

Ooh when you said that the bars on my wireless connection rating thing went up |:
/me is going to be dead! :D
Eventually.
I think.
D:
Up until then, I just hope it will be a pleasant ride.
12*facepalms@hisbrother*

School is fun
12Oh god, my mom wants me to friend her on facebook...

12I go one the internet to get /away/ from her... >.>
i refused to take them
lol
My mum is friends with me on facebook :(
o.O
BYE
12Eh, I only made it so my girlfriend would leave me alone about it.
When I made facebook it was the thing that EVERYONE was on, such as Bebo
RIP Bebo
RIP PS1
Well, I'm gonna go get my oil changed
D:
Is it just me or do even PS2s seem outdated now?
12At where I used to live, it was myspace.... I move around enough to notice these things...
k
12I guess...
lol
yeah ps2 are dead i think there were only 5 games reelased on it this year so far
I play PSX games on my laptop now. The console isn't as reliable.
I miss the excitement of buying an awesome new PS2 game
Like Spyro.
12Everythings about graphics now...
All these PS3 and Wii games are stupidly expensive!
Yeah, like spyro :(
wii only $50 ...... n64 were 50 ps1 were 50 back int he 90's but i definitely agree about ps3 $60 way too much for a short game
i'll quit gaming if next gen systems games are $70......
Wii games are between £20 and £40 here.
/me is on fire!
If you look hard enough in some shops you can get the odd DS game for £10
But they're usually the crap ones that nobody plays, like the crossword ones >_>
?
"Everythings about graphics now,,," And that is why I still thoroughly enjoy my Battlefield 1942 game. It's the first Battlefield game that was ever released.
graphics arn't important to me why i got a wii :p
Mrrrnrrmrr. Mrawrnrr. Mrrrrrrnrr. Mrr.
I should totally record myself saying that.
12I got a wii because my uncle didn't want it...
lol
okay
My old GBA is in my loft somewhere :D

:3
sorry the truth is currently unavailable, come back another time
D:
04hi
hmm
shy
LK?
hi
hello
Sup?
mew
if you don't, it'd be the same as if you inverted the phase of one of them as stereo
if you did, you'd get silence
!op
!deop
03in English?
03would it sound good or not
it'd sound as good as if you inverted the phase of one of L or R in stereo
Hello
you want me to say that in cantonese then?
/me hide
hii
03no
:3
03invert the phase though... what's that sound like?
Full reset: check invert phase for one of them
or use stereo expander
03full reset does what?
use the Full reset preset in channel mixer & check invert phase for one of them
03but what does it do to the sound?
full reset is exactly what it says
i'm modifying it from a full reset
03yeah but full reset does what... mutes it?
no
resets it back to defaults
which is normal
or use graphic panner: full reset and draw zigzags in the first tab
night Quan~
03wait full reset is just like nu8ll transform?
03-8
yes, to make sure we're on the same in terms of settings
03OK so then what o.o
7Gooooooood night, everyone.
night~
what what?
03after I do full reset
03I do wht
03what
scroll up, i've given you several options
hai
I <3 applebee's
and my finger hurts
My father works there.
ello
they have amazing shrimp
mmm
I haven't had shrimp in forever
some nice fried shrimp sounds really good right now
same thing until tonight
03you know
03with one channel inverted
03it sounds fine, really
03it just loses some bass
03for w/e reason
:D
:D
ohai May and Feather~
Hi~
i dont think it loses bass, you just perceive because the center is moved to the sides
hey
03well
um
03it sounds a ton better than inverted average
03go ahead./
03you think that would be enough to fool the YT filter tho?
what
because no stereo information is lost
k
/me offers you a cookie
(it's just changed)
inverted average loses stereo information
Im stuffed :P
03yeah I figured
03so would that fool the fingerprinter you think
oh
._.
I'm sorry.

/me puts cookie away

stupid icechat
@.@
12i'm usually banned when here lol
hm?
why?
But but
I'm totally going to propose when I get out there D:
What he doesn't know won't hurt :3
I'm right-clicking on people's names for the nick list commands and the menu doesn't open
but but
ish otay
is only for a few minutes
just a bar that says "nicklist commands"
I promise
wtf
=/
x3
wow de ja vu
wtf IceChat
has this happened before
?
I don't know o.o
I get that bar too but the menu's beneath it
=/
hmm
/me wonders if it's a compatibility issue
hmm
like with the crossover to Widnows 7?
*Windows
just a guess, I really have no idea
yeah
it would make sense to me
I could test it
moving my hard drive to our windows 7 computer
test it how?
oh
and loading up IceChat
I've been meaning to test this out on another computer anyway
night RDX
I think I will test it
brb
04i know who you are
04.... why is my text red
07there?
07wow... i'm going to be scratching my head on that one for a while Drake
04lol
07how goes
aww
?
it was working great until I actually tried connecting to the server
what was?
then it gave me some error about not being able to create a package
IceChat
on the Windows7 PC
I'm back on the laptop now
yeah, probably some compatibility issues
it was coded in 2008
yeah
probably doesn't have Windows 7 in mind
:P
/me needs to find a newer IRC client
the one I was suggesting earlier
what was it called again?
I don't remember
Maybe I'll just get mIRC or something
smuxi
mIRC is only a free trial remember
then you have to pay
or just redo the trial
well yeah
but that would be like stealing
:P
uh
what do you see for my hostmask
blueflame
that's the ident
what comes after that?
and then all the usual numbers
the 888 etc
hmm
I see <ip address>.stuff.mn.comcast.net
P.p

lol P.p
everyone else's is normal though
well that's odd
inb4 fail
I would think maybe I screwed something up with the installation but that's not really possible
all you have to do is click the buttons
well it might just be acting up too
more compatability issues
I wouldn't really know though

04Fail connection
Ra
12Fail -v-
04lol the ghost thing isn't working
Hey Articuno
How are you?
Hey RN
12Thats the second PM I've sent you RN XD
12I;m a bit P****ed off to say the least#
12Yesterday Lugia barely worked on TST and today he said he'd be here all day to work on it, well he's not. And he won;t answer his damn phone
Ugh he's quiiiite unreliable
12Quite??
12I've never known anyone so unreliable
12¬¬
Articuno: If you haven't figured out, I am excellent at understating things
12He's probably left his phone somewhere, or has it on silent or something stupid like that
12??? ok? That's random
Not really - [16:37:29] <Articuno> Quite?? <- was in reply to you sounding peeved at me not expressing just how unreliable he is with a stronger word
12No no
Oh XD;
12-v-
04got to go now anyway, picking Burnett up from work ^^
12forget it, I hate mIRC and text geting misinterpreted
12Also I seem to have just misread what you said
12I misread understating as understanding -_____-
12thats why it came across as random to me LOOOOOOOL
Oh!
Fff-
I was getting prepared to defend myself because Arrow frequently prods me for these things
Being unclear, understating things, etc
Sorries ^^;
That said Arti
I temp blocked both him and Ms. Maine Girl
12Well I was just emphasising how unreliable he is because of how annoyed I am at him right now lol#
12Well good
She would NOT let me go yesterday and had me explain my feelings around the two of them being together
got me into a 'ffdhjkf no you, stop it' mood
Arrow's just feeling a sense of defeat as far as I'm concerned - well, I'll be back for the two of them eventually, it's terrible to block communication like that but I feel I have to.
I'll be talking to Arrow in a few days, because I know he's sensitive to feeling ignored and put aside, will be resentful if I don't show up eventually
But beyond that
I'll try and keep them at a distance like that
12Well whats worse? Him feeling like that or you telling him the truth that you don't want to hear abotu him and another girl?
I think the former in all honesty
12Why didnt you tell him the truth then?
Wait - I did actually
remember the three points he replied to?
12Oh yes
that's why he feels defeated
I think
if I told him
"Hey you, stop talking about Marissa in my presence"
He'd lock up entirely
12Is that worse than ignoring him then?#
12*blockingh
12-h
12Long time no see
Yeh because if I add that about Marissa he might feel compelled to remove me from his contacts. I've seen it happen before, I've told Arrow off for too much and countered him being all weird
and he withdraws entirely
I want to resume contact eventually
So I'm going to wait until my feelings to him die in a fire
then he can talk about her all he wants.
hi Articuno! I was just out at camp ^^
how you doing?
12But your feelings for him might not die for a very long time..
Quite true..
12It'd be easier to just let him bugger off on his own and wait for him to come back because he WONT just end contact with you forever just because you were honest with him.
I guess so...
12You said so yourself, how many times has he done that before?
12And he always comes back
Lost count
Sometimes I have to chase him around all over the place
but he returns eventually
I think Arrow holds me in pretty high regards still
Aside from Marissa, he does IM me every day without me contacting him, heh
12It's just people not having their own way
12anyway -v- I said I wouldnt give you anymore advice but I find myself doing it without even thinking .. argh
Sorries
I'll just
12Meh, not your fault
go about putting up some photos on facebook I think
Some things from the trip..
None of Arrow, though
Just those of me
12brb
Ok
12Gonna be on and off, BBQ.

6bye all
bye Roara~ O:
its a thingy
hm?
y?
hit my head
/me hugs Proto's brain
Fallout 2 nostalgia
:o
/me likes Fallout 3 ^^
"whats a hydronehaowhatever?"
"hajahakagaskhccogghgkagdkaH well technically,...its called a thingy"
Fallout 3 is meh
but expansions were cool
if they made it more to the original fallout universe with the realisms of it then it'd be better
like how Super mutants are like the rats of Fallout 3
easily killable
that and I find it odd that in Fallout 2, they were already rebuilding society pretty well
Vault City, Gecko, etc
while in Fallout 3 it was like Fallout 1 but basically you take alot of stuff away
the simularity is that there is only one vault that seems to be livable
and the rest are dead or infested
http://failblog.org/2010/08/17/epic-fail-photos-superior-technology-fail/
Xbox 360 and PC
I think
It might be on PS3 by now too
do you mod it?
XDD
it is
with all its expansions
Lolwut, when did this chat become actine o-o
actine?
03active*
03.-.
when I said Fallout
hey
*nexus
Like what?
it depends really
some mods deal with Deathclaws looking more like from Fallout 2
more Deathclaw-ish
and then theres others that deal with homes
stories
etc
All of them are annoying to kill
and some just to add cool armour
I wish it would take less bullets to kill things
well thats the point
only with Fallout 1 and 2 it took more on chances and if you're skilled/dumb enough to take something stronger then you
like for instance Harry
only way I killed him was because of my combat shotgun
alright
which costed about over 4,000 bottlecaps
cussing at facebook
yay!
supplied by DAVID KEITH
Hehe
I love how he was in Fallout 1 as the (spolierspolierspolier)
though one thing I loath with Fallout 3 is that it has confusing morals
like for instance in ten penny tower you kill the ghouls you are bad
you kill the rich snobs you are bad
you make them live together so they might kill one another you are good
or how the enclave literally spilts because of the 2nd genocide plan they have
whoa
activity
and fallout 3
but at least it isnt a complete copy like Fallout New Vegas
which is just Van Buren only...its by Bethseda
lol
so I clicked this link someone gave me in a facebook IM
and it redirected me to a page that had me sign into facebook
...only I was too stupid to check the url
am I screwed?
I changed my password immediately
and ran a virus scan
and made sure no harmful procceses were running
also lol
enclave talk on fallout 2 is fucking hilarious
7o3o
gtg now
bye~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXwlDWPBnzU&feature=related
hopefully it only got your old facebook password
07o3o
that's what I don't get though
yeah
if that's all it does
why set up an entire domain for it?
how are random people's facebook passwords valuable to anyone?
yeah
that too
that's why I think it must do more
it was a co.cc
like we almost used for our site
co.cc domains are free
oh okay
nevermind then
I think
throws my suspicion out the window
or at least that part of it
So the site
Did it look exactly like the facebook login page?
exactly
same logos
same links
even had my email automatically entered in
all I need to put in was the password
I wish I had a junk computer I don't care about so I could check it our
*out
as long as you don't put the password in it might be fine
might be
I could screenshot it otherwise
you never know
Don't go to it again!
D:
/me blinks several times
this headache sucks
I was more curious about the source code and where the other links lead to
hey Proto
hi
Hi Proto
oh stuff like that
how are you today?
hi
other than the headache
same as yesterday
:(
maybe worse, can't tell really
just avoid facebook at all costs and you won't get worse
I don't have a book of faces, but thanks for the advice
you are a smart man
I used to not have one
I would go that far
wouldn't*
XD
I think that smack on the head knocked a few points off my iq
:O
oh noes
how did you smack your head?
I stood up under the mirror of a big suv who parked close to the line, had dropped a bottle and bent down to pick it up
>.>
hit it hard enough to make the mirror go up and down a bit
I can see how that ended
I felt that with my head
it's been like three hours
I've hit me head on table corners doing that many times
and a tylenol
lol, I was getting a drink of water in middle school once, and the water fountains in most places are recessed into the walls and didn't step back far enough one day, side of my head on a concrete block wall
I get hurt a lot
We've noticed.
HUMPH.
/me storms off.
D:
m/en gives up on spelling right
/me continues storming off.
/me plays the song that is likely to give him carpal tunnel.
/me mumbles something
I'm getting gta iv tomorrow
and pizza
and my schedule for school, which is the next day
:(

II'll switch school starting days with you

Proto, do you seeeeeee?
No
Still no AC at work, but at least there's 2 new fans
..
Go seeeeeee!
Sigh
Sometimes
It feels like nothing changed
The tone of which I'm being talked to
The topic
The easy flow of the conversation
It feels like time is standing still - and yet, coming to reality...
Everything is so different.
...wow
this super mutant looks ridculous
Thankfully I'm off the next 4 days :3
Lolwut
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Tabitha
this is the 'leader' of what remains of the Master's Army in The Majove Desert
and New Vegas...actually looks kinda good

*200 years
though interesting they put religious groups back in Fallout
HULLO

Evanescence

Foo Fighters, Red, Box Car Racer
/me whispers "Linkin Park"
all good bands

*Park

LINKING PARK

I think he said that was his favorite band
I don't think they're terrible, but not great either
I don't care for them much
I don't know why though
just makes me think of Transformers
*shudders*
"Your album is now downloading. When it completes, you'll need to unzip it. If that makes you go Un-what-now? please click here. "

Whereas Freshman year is when you're taking the easy and a few elective classes
Drake; o3o

Junior year is okay. It depends on what you've been doing, but it's a bit funner since you'll probably have a few of the smelly classes out of the way.

12Prank call?

its funny
12I don't has a cell. >.<
12I feel like the only teen in the world that doesn't
awww i found some website that gave me sum numbers and its funny as hell
i was a teen with no cell, i got my phone at 18
10^ I thought there was a rule prohibiting any talk of drugs :P
:/
12Well, I am getting one for my birthday, used, but something.
lol
it's a cigar ><
yeah
thats the spirt!!!
something always better then nothing
as long as the something doesnt bring you pain or shame
10Meh, a drug is anything that alters the mind or body of the person taking it
12Yeah.
10Cigarettes contain nicotine, which is a highly addictive stimulant :|
Good evening peoples.
12Your right...
hell yeah i am
here is a letter i found its funny
/me sits all over Skylands
03cigarettes != drugs but they're still just as bad
a young man was at the end of his rope
seeing no way out, he dropped to his knees in prayer.
07talking about them isn't allowed, but that's just a mention
"Lord i cant go on, (he cryed")
i have too heavy of a cross to bear
(Lord) my son if you cant bear its weight, just place it in this room and take another cross out with you
10!sneas
/me now belongs to Skylands for 11 minutes
4the man walks around in the room looking at all the crosses
4some crosses where soo big that the top wasnt visable
4the man finly comes across a small cross
/me pokes Sneas
2(Man) lord i have found the cross i want. i will take this small cross with me, thank you
4the lord responds
(Lord) thats the cross you walked in with my son
het it

12Kinda.
07o3o
03o.o

Sneas; you ever play morrowind?
We use candy for chips in our poker games.
07Kipi always loses cuz he eats them all
You'd think that

But I only eat a few at a time and I usually end up with more than I want to eat
03Nope o.o
So I'll "cash out" and put all my candy in the pot. XP
07cash out means you take your money away ya dip D:
I know
And I do whatever I want with it
12Yeaah.

/me 2makes a fool out of himself
AZ has the highest car accident rate in the country. XP
2lol
But I'm a safe driver, generally
I stay between 40-45 mph
I don't answer phones while driving
2in the 10-20 mph zones

7Interlaced PNGs are different from ordinary PNGs in that the code varies by having a stichlike weaving. It looks no different than normal PNG, which uses a linear code.
2sooo what should i use?

12i guess that is a liberal way of saying it
fail
I should PM him
cause some drama
help keep that place alive
I don't remember acknowledging it was ridiculous in his presence.
yeah exactly I should pm him hmmm
I already told him it was a joke. The magic ran out.
"I knew it!" Sure, kid.
His response after I clued him in on it being a joke:"XDDDD I KNEW IT!! I THOUGHT FROM THE START IT WAS A JOKE, BUT THEN I THOUGHT OTHERWISE! XDDD woo... woohoo.....hahahaaa... but i actuallly was ticked off, i thought you were serious. aw,snap, that was a good one."
just the other day
Ha, Doppel is still roaming?
apparently
I've seen him trying to get on SC back when I still went there

I'd be worried to bring my friends here.

*social
Oh, alright.

When we were fighting Campion.
so anyway.. I'm bored :( anyone want to do something?
sorta
Melonsaurus Rex
honestly I dont even know much about the campion deal I don't think I really understood, or it was too short or something
Campion was just a hacker who got mixed up with GoG fangirls.
I pretend to go bad and join him to free their site.
you should browse at the music topics there after you register for some new bands
2o.o
*pretended
lol
o.O
##channels?
*right
/me hugs LL again
He ended up not being so smart, since the password he changed their administration panel to on their site was "password."
LOL
/me huggles back gently "Laaaa?"
they thought they werr\e so pr0 for figuring that out, too.
*They
*were
:P

Yesh. :o

But why are there two urban dictionaries?
I thought we were talking about stuff out of your frame of reference.
So you couldn' get a word in. xD
oh no
*couldn't
I was just busy registering
Ah.
/me shakes her head "Sadly not, but we'll see what happens in future..."
awws. well be sure to poke me if you think of anything, kay?
On freenode we used ##urbandictionary, because its an unoffical project type thing..
/me goes to get soopur snackz.
I shall
He had #urbandictionary on here first, but we decided to create ##urbandictionary so there wouldnt be confusion when we tried to get people to switch here...
k
I keep wanting to type Aicebp
lol
k you should be able to access it now
No, we made ##urbandictionary because the relay bot didn't work with #UrbanDictionary.
We're all different names there.
yeah I'll fill you in on who's who
Haha, win.
I use that name everywhere
:P
k
you'll see some old posts too, myworld47 is/was my cousin who owned the site with me

03XD
and you can still create a free forum but it's too frustrating to use
LOL the member list is two pages long
and it deletes if you dont use it for 7 days
I love small communities the best anyway
My biggest beef with php is that it won't allow you to change your domain name.
well that's nice, visiting friends is fun
yeah
Or it didn't back then.
/me nods

I tried posting again and it worked
It won't even keep my logged in.
Something of a test
Blaza: a test I took o3o
has to do with the freemason originazation
It has made me login after each refresh.
it did that for me too
Ok uh
03freemasons, XD
You took a test
03reminds me of National Treasure
I assume you're at home
And negative is a good thing
03those movies were awesome
This leads me to believe things
:/ Stupid php.
I told it to automatically sign me in after every vist and that fixed it
if you guys click on "log in automatically" when you log in it won't do that
yeah
RDX's forum did that too
you'd like lost symbol then
I don't want to.
:P
then you just log out whenever your actually done
but it's a whopping 600 pages, I think
he got it fixed somehow
I'm not at home
I read it when it first came out so, lol, I don't remember
I never go to his though
All right, all right
and I'm not sure how I feel about the result...

All right fine do it
D:
we will be a different network
EpicHoodsDarkChat.
2aero never once messaged me back on me RO related messages D:
we're using their name by the sound of it
oxo
Now what test
I don't feel comfortable saying it...
we think everyone should've had a say in what the new name is
instead only the network ops did
and even then
Eeep.
All right, all right, I give.
That's sort of fair, though.
so now the network will be called darchoods
Okay, never mind.
:/
Wow.
the other idea was darc-chat
with another network ?
what network >_>
which I liked so much more
D ouchebaggery.
Excuse my language.
I thought so yeah
also darc-side came up
XD
Nice.
I changed my nick to Vader and said I'd be the mascot

Also, you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do
2:{
He's basically estranged from it, right?

I suppose so
2i was pointing out the better things in it
03ircops can :D

He has actually invested money?
XDDDDDd

Force him?
Aero's a female.

/me adds another fail to Rip's 2
yeah I guess so
He used to be so much cooler to be around.
and brb
so I've heard
Now he's... cynical and strict.
and only ever talks about stuff he wants to talk about
Essentially.
k
Which is fair enough.
and just sits there silenty the rest of the time
yeah
He only talks when he wants to fight about something.
that would be okay
agreed
But if he's paying, let him do what he wants.
http://muzicmatters.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?p=8171#8171 :D?
if he didn't always interrrupt other conversations to do it
would be a bad idea to take a nap now
12i need to relax
no advrtising stoopid
12too much stuff
a loooong list of names?

Since I have to get going soon. ._.
gooooooooooooooooood I know I've met more I just can't remember them :(
I'm no good and typing, really, but I am known as a spelling nazi at my school XDD
since when has this channel's title been capitalized?
XD
[/random notice]
2lol
it's not capitalized to me...o___o;
hmm
I love how my public journal on that site is basically just cryptic messages to myself chronicling my life at that point.
exactly
it says #DraconicWolves for me
used to say #draconicwolves
oh god I'm scared to look at my journal LOL
I noticed that, too.
MAY
Weird.
it's August.
to the journal
Okay, hold up.
lol I know
I gotta go
bye now
8D
bye
...*deletes my own journal*
XD
I can't get "King of Pain" out of my head now.
haha
I'm listening to that meg and dia album now, its alright but it's not enough to grab my attention from what I'm doing
/me wants to stay and play Alien Swarm with LightLie! \o/
Freeze, turkeys!
I will later
need some sleep and will be up in a few hours after that
:o
2kk

/me is probably not very good at the game and the game probably does not run very smoothly for him :3
2hopefully the site will be done tomarow T_T
2so i can actualy see it D:
I can tell
=/
I never knew you were so sad back then
I trust you, though. Plus, that's all behind me. I was just being dramatixc.
*dramatic
:X
I appreciate that you trust me
I was more than sad, haha.
No problem. You're a great guy.
yeah seems like borderline depression
thanks
you are too
T'anks.
teary dramatic moment
:P
XDX
It's a laugh and a distraught face combined.
lol
you knwo what's ironic?
What?
as I'm reading this
my iTunes is playing some of my music from a depressing stage in my life
going to bed, will be back on tomorrow maybe
Cyas
Hm... interesting.
it's like fate or something
:P
or not fate
I feel like going on a nostalgia roll one day in music
but a sign?
<late!>
I dunno
I'm STILL late! DX
listening to the aiden albums and the mcr albums and placebo albums
and all that
<3
though
my nostalgic music isn't stuff that makes me happy
it makes me sad and happy all at once
all my positive music is recent taste
for a more positive mind
but most the sad comes from stuff about the OFF actually LOL like how we're not this tight close little community anymore
"Like how busy, workaholic men play golf." ROFL
XD
/me squeezes her Digger plushie
Yeah.
I'm rereADING IT IN EMBARASSMENT.
*Woah, caps.
dude
I was so embarrassed at mine I deleted it hahahah
this sounds a lot like how I was back then
well
sort of
Back in the stage?
like I said, long lost brothers
:P
yeah so to speak
:P
just out of curiosity
were you by any chance 15?
14
In what post?
or 14 3v3n
I stretches back to 14.
*even
ACCIDENTAL LEET
*it
XDDDD
XDDD
I bet it's that age
14-15.
though some [censored]ty stuff did happen to me that year
I have an earlier journal, too, but it's basically just lame boring events.
so freshman year of high school, right?
Mhm.
same as me then
that was the worst year of my life
Dammiy, that time was rough.
yeah it was
Remember when... xD
XD
I doubt the depressing stuff itself was the same
That was when I stopped seeing my best friend for a year.
but the fact tyhat it happened at the same age
that happened to me too that year
dude, you're kidding.
but that wasn't the depressing part >.>
well, second best friend
Nah, not for me either. It was just conflict-filled.
he was being a [censored] and I was being a whiny brat
He was changing, and didn't notice, and I was fed up.
we both needed to stop talking to each other and matue
*mature
Mhm.
Makes sense.
we're best friends now
:D
back then he was a major douche
the type who feels pleasure when making fun of others'
he changed for the better though
this reminds me of an experience too
:P
because he sort of has flawed morals
Yeah, that's basically how my friend was. Thing is, he was in no position to make fun of anyone.
isnt it amazing how sometimes the people you fight with most and it hurts most end up being one of your best friends in the end still?
It was js\ust a result of the torment he received in middle school.
*just
but he's still my best friend because he's always there for me, even when he disagrees
mhmm
That's good.
that's exactly what it's like
BBL on DSi
yep I went through something similar with someone
BBL on DSi
brb
g'night
he's the one I did landscaping with
Oh, okay.
Is he on FB too?
[/creep]
also the one that made movies with me
we have a youtube channel;
no he isn't
he hates facebook
Haha, nice.
lost a lot of respect for me when I got one
I make zombie movies with my friends. They're so bad it's funny.
our channel is monopolyguy19
We make them bad on purpose.
See you later :3
Bai!
Oh, I see.
ironically he isn't Carl
What kind of stuff do you do?
but they both use monopolyguy
back
well
our full length movies are like yours
12sould
gah I should probably sleep too
laskdfj;laskdfj
satires of bad action movies basically
03LOL
12:<
Awesome.
but our stuff on youtube is simpler
we made a music video
(most recent project)
Lol, funny or serious?
as well as a tribute/mockumentary of one of our friends who misteriously disppeard one day (no joke ther)
lol, nothing we make is serious
xP
Wait, they vanished
*mysteriously
yeah
stopped coming to school
Dude, same thing happened in eight grade for me.
3 months later the kid signed into xbox live and we talked to him for like 3 hours
This weird girl who never went to gym class just disappeared. Still registered, no notification.
he said he's keep in touch
but he didn't
14D:
14I barely got on
Huh.
Could it be Witness Protection, lol?
14and I didn't say goodbye D:
he gave us a phone number
14anyways
nobody answered
14this comic seriously made me lol irl
or at least
the wrong person did
you know what was freaky ashell though?
What?
before he signed into Live I got a voice message from him
only it wasn;t his voice
D:
it said "you can't stop me"
that's...creepy
and I swear to God I am not pulling your leg
o_____o;
this really happened
Nah, I believe you.
Did you ask him?
when he signed in he said he had no clue what it was
he had sold his xbox and just now got it back
that's still really creepy
when did that happen?
How long before was the message from when you talked?
so I was thinking the guy he sold it to must;ve just done that to a random friend
like an hour
07lol
07*not irl*
but I first got it the /instant/ he signed in
I did stuff like that. xD
yeah we did too
I'd be a schizo in people's parties.
14lol
03sigh
07irl or not irl?
03stupid Google is decling my crediot card
/me runs
03-o
oh ok
So who answered when you called?
some lady from another state
/me stifles a yawn
oh yeah I forgot to tell you what we found out
back~
why he disappeared
14hiiii
apparently he moved to Arizona
Why am I thinking he was either mental and they didn't want to make a big thing of it or he got pulled out for Witness Protection?
xD
hai Roara~
actually I bet it was family issues
he hated his mom so much
07LL wrote down the numbers are racked up 20 thousand dollars in fraudulent charges so they froze it
07wasn't that obvious?
03LOL
Oh, gotcha.
/me flees
o.o
07*and
07o3o
03> stupid Google is decling my credit card
03that was @ that
14inb4 drf dies
his parents were split
03but seriously, my bank doesn't even show
lolz
Soul
03that there was any attempted charges
03tomorrow I will call them up and rage
his dad in Wisconsin and his mom in California
03as I want my LogMeIn app
03and I can't buy it if it keeps decling my Visa
Then who's in Arizona?
nini :<
drf and I spent the whole day together o3o
then his dad took his sister and him to arizona
we asked why
Oh.
14so I guessed
03And LL didn't use that face once IRL
/me runs
14drf, girl or boy?
12hmm
and he DOES have non-pirated movies!
03WHY DOES EVERYBODY ASK ME THAT
03I won't ask
/me 14runs
03er
/me hides
and apparently his dad got cancer and needed to live somewhere warmer
03I won't answer
inb4 LIES
03XD
Makes sense.
14well, because you're the only person (besides BL) who has met LL
14on here
what we don't get is why they never told the school
or his friends
03yeah but
drf
03if LL won't say normally
03why would I?>
Yeah, that's what happened with the chick.
03?
even before this we thought he hated us
14dunno
again the "or"...
She moved to California apparently.
14it was worth asking though
14:P
/me FLEES
03XD
03well
jk
he was one of my friend's victims
huh
03you really think I want to ruin my friendship? ;.;
Never mind.
14no
03yeah
03so I won'

thank god for gmail
and then we died
now we're in heaven
all our names are white
Lol.. didn't expect to see Dari here.
D:
because ou host marks are different
They aren't white for me.
so the colors I had set for everyone disappeared
/me points at Mibbit
Oh, I see.
that's why
What client?
My names are coloured.
IceChat
Because mIRC is more awesome than mibbit.
Urgh. Never liked that.
/me used to have icechat but it hurt my eyes
*blarg

BlueBlaze still says it to me, in mocking.
blueblaze....
I know this name

It's my friend Ray.

what's up
Awake!
I'm sorry D:
not much
about to go out for a bit
/me wish he knew more about murders and executi....erm... mergers and acquisitions
There's apparently an entire field out there about how that kind of stuff workds
rawr
/me waves to Linky
bah bbl
o/
sup
About to go to school
And learn things
heh >.<
And then I'm going to oversee something
sounds almost kinky
>.>
I forgot what .... I'm sure someone will remind me once I get there
i think lou\ve got the db merges sorted last night
Cool
so if everything is sorted, should be able to try linkin later
My vice president is handling it, I just have to make sure nothing bad happens :3
Cool
should be interesting
xD
Hi
i think we only have like 1 nick collision
^^
mhm
Indeed.
im buggin prince on msn nao
it was OK
pretty much the same thing I usually do only with no customers around to distract me
Oh, that's awesome
I saw something pretty neat at walmart the other day
I was in line in the 10 items or less line, and the line was kind of backed up because 1) the lady had like 30 items and 2) none of her cards were working
heh
And she seemed like someone who was down on her luck
So, the person directly in front of me actually went up there and used her card and bought everything for the lady :3
Aww
/me nods
That was nice of her :)
:)
/me though so too
I'm off, cya
/me too
:o
/me waves
:O

rar!
yip
ra?
Hullo, Lady Arti
what's wrong Kipi?
Just me bein' nervous is all.
oh, what for?
In less than 40 minutes, I'll be drivin' to GCC for my first day in college
woah...
Yeah
that's big..
I've been thinkin' about it constantly for the past two weeks
Even last night, I had a dream that I overslept and missed all my classes. XP
hey you still have us to turn to if you're feeling down while you're there but I'm sure you'll havw fun and make friends
lol..
Down? Nay, it's mostly excitement, anticipation, 'n' nervousment
oh good ^^ ish lol
But you know what they say, "the wait is worse than the moment"..
/me hugs Arti
GCC's not that far, but I'm going an hour early to find a parking spot and find where all my classes are located.
are you moving out then or just gonna travel each day?
I shall travel
cool :>
:3 Transportation arrangments are kind of confusing though. I don't have(and don't want) my own car so I'll be using my Mom's on Mondays & Wednesdays. On Tuesdays and possibly Thursdays, I'll be takin' the bus. Friday... at this point is a mystery. Mom would be getting out of work early on that day so she has to have the car, but Friday is also the day I
need to go early.
LOL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE
Anyhoo... all's well, really. XP I'm just concerning myself with what-ifs, and other stuff. How 'bout you though?

I'm stressing over trying to get TST back up

12Well shit, that was long ago.
I recognize your name.
Indeed it was.
I recognize you, and prince dari
prince dari had that server set up at one time.
Mmhmm,

Or has everybody realized insomniac was the bomb? ;D

14owo
14Well, that first comment was curious.
2OAo
I guess my mind went bork at this
But really
Wars, devastation, genocide, militarism, and now this
2oAo
Sometimes I wonder if humanity's mission is to exterminate itselfg
*itself
6I wouldn't say it's the mission
6but I'd say we're headed that way anyways
Completely, in the slowest and most painful and horrendous manner possible
Sigh
Really
I don't know what I can do, really
The only way humanity is to wake up from this is when everything is utterly, completely devastated
6pretty much
Nuclear Winter, human extinction, complete destruction of Earth, etc.
6but I can't say I've given up
I'm giving up
6there are people who, like you and me, understand what we're headed to
14We've came close to striking 12 on the doomsday clock, but there's always something to rewind it.
So what can we do
6I have just given up for the blind ones, the ones who have vengeful souls, and the ones who live off another's pain
6us? well
6keep being us
6because there's a good population of good people out there
I really hope there are
6I know there are
14Oh, yeah. Rora?
6otherwise we would have been destroyed LONG ago
14I had a dream that I somehow accessed TST forums.
14And yeah, no one was there. Owo
True though, that.
/me 6can access them, but that's beside the point
21 December 2012
14Y2k.
I sometimes secretly wish something really major does happen on that date
Something to jolt humanity out of this madness
6 12/21/12, I will be one of those people laughing
6because I don't believe it
I don't either
6it's sad :|
But sometimes, I secretly do
It doesn't have to be world ending
14Sure, let a few stock markets crash.
Just something global and devastating enough
6in the first wars, we used sticks, in the second wars, we used guns, in the third wars, we used nuclear missles
2o-o
6in the fourth wars, we'll use sticks
You know, in a part of Indonesia there was a civil war going on for YEARS
14Replicating that alleged Einstein quote?
Suddenly, peace
2o3o
14The Koreas have been warring since... well, they never stopped since they divided, I think.
2gosh
6I just wish there was another, less painful way of war
12chess tournament :D
Those people realised that Mother Nature are better mass murderers than humans.
14War really does nothing.
2D:
In war, only Death wins
6but I think the brutality of it is what keeps us from REALLY messing things up
Like nuclear bombs.
2yeah
6we CAN NOT all agree on something
6it's that simple
14You kill thousands of people, and it's only through discussions which peace is made.
6there's 8 billion of us
6it's not happeninhg
6-h
2o3o
After the world saw what it did to the Japanese, people made thousands of them but dared not use them anymore
2...
2we did?
2oAo
6which, while it's scary
!define Paradigm
-!- systematic arrangement of all the inflected forms of a word
6I'm happy for
2MAD
We do not all need to agree
6because that knowledge was bound to come at some time
6so we used it at the best moment
6and now everyone is scared
What we all need to agree is that disagreements need not be settled with violence
2o/) We don't have to become one, if we just accept one another~ o/)
6I'm just scared of the one who decides "forget what happens to us, launch the missiles"
2... oAo
Unfortunately, not everyone agrees on that too
6that face is just as annoying as o3o now
o3oAo
14owo
14You're not gonna do anything to me, are you? Owo
In the end, all I can do is to pray, pray for humanity
/me 12yawns
I can only pray that those who are blind to anything but violence and hatred to open their eyes
And those who have suffered in their hands will eventually find peace

2XD
12I know...
2you guys ran into a problem, didn't you?
6Articuno's part is done (except I found another bug just now, so I'll have to bring that up)
12If you were, you'd be mine.
6it shouldn't be hard to fix
2ah.
6Lugia told us yesterday that his part is the last that needs to be done, and should take 3-5 hours
6of course, that's Lugia time
2oAo
6for us, that could be a while
14Bleh.
14Fish you, Lugia.
6but I wouldn't imagine it lasting more than a couple days
6unless we hit another BUG
2hmm
14Well, bugs are quite possible.
6yeah, but he's pretty certain this is it
6and so I hope it'll be over soon
2"this is it"
14Okay. Middle the week, then?
2isn't that like
6most likely

Bai, Rain D:

i don't understand it
'Erroneous' means that there's an invalid character in your nick.

2it's white
WTF @ Apple battery charger
only does two batteries at a time? Lame
also less power used = slower charging
2XD
I like my 15 minute NiMH charger that sucks power like a mofo LOL, new batteries in only 15 minutes
another thing you need to add to !apple
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SAFARI

"EW Apple battery chargers"?
but seriously
Nah, I won't bother
i lol'd when i saw that
2"EW SAVING POWER"
XD
yeah
LOL
well
I'
2Naked tastes funny
wait WHAT
anyway
2it's usually sweeter than this
2._.
I'm all for saving power if it doesn't sacrifice performance
2o3o
but with things like battery chargers, generally the more watts the faster they charge
2you mean speed
um
sure
2hmm
in this case yes
2I wonder why
in the case of computers I mean performance
...
2o3o
it's not rocket science
think of it like this
picture a battery as a big water tower
picture the electricity as a hose
2o3o
the more water you pour at once
the faster the tank fills up
right
so saving power would be like only running the water at half power, etc
2picture drf missing the water tower and spraying the guy next door
LOL
That'
That's not my point >_>
2o3o
2XD

like if you're a kid
then that doesn't count

6of course, you lose it if you go over the height

Dammiy, I knew we were all in his imagination.
gots some crazy channels
I Am You by Demon Hunter
like growl but mrowl
^ Nice
yes it has changed
3Just like in the Dark knight!
we are now DarcHoods
3Sor of...
*good
ohay
12I use ... pancakes to kill people.
Yes it is
Hiya
7Vulcan: I thought you were a dragon?
7Mary-Sue much?
Hi :3
Boo! Down with DarcHoods, up with epic-chat!
7also, is it just your skin made of metal, or all of you?
up with bubbles, down with air.
14Nope. I am a dragon. and there is a Difference in Mary-Sue. I aint one. I can only master things that are metaloids.
3I use CAKE to kill people
well we get to keep services
Nematodes are people too.
Usurp! Overthrow! Rampage!
they get the name and website
12Vulcan: A mary sue is a perfect character.
Ann Archy.
12Sickeningly perfect.
3Ensign sue must die!
7also, is it just your skin made of metal, or all of you?
6FINALLY
14every bit of my body has some percent of metal in it, my scales are 80% metal. everything else is less then 40%
12Vulcan: Mating must really hurt.
7I see. and it's steel, right?
03XD
/me hides
14Mixed.
6LOL yeah
3Icy... You would say that
6I laughed everytime I had to type that
7you realise steel is already an alloy?
2all I saw was Reborn XD
6I still do whenever I read it
/me 2giggles
14Titanium, Iron, Zinc, Copper, you name it.
6ugh you guys lol
3But would you rather be mating with Steel? Or Ice?
2Roara, that is EPIC
7Dixie Normous
6anyways yeah
14Yes, Steel is an alloy...I know that already.
6NEVER shall I complain about drawing suicune's tailribbons again
7either your mother had a c-section or is some kind of god
14But if I had to define what Metal mix I was, it would be Titanium Alloy.
/me stares
03:|
O.o
Is she not welcome?
03LOL
03I was totally gonna talk to her too
03oh well
/me 6puts a book between Arti and the screen
6LOL BL
Haha.
6what was that about
Jack Hoff.
12lol
7I see.
12Chicken.
3You're... A titanium dragon?
07o3o
/me melts down Vulcan and sells him for monez.
12I can't stop..
12I never ever imagined a shadow suicune..
14The same material as my Armor. *negates, since he has a power over living or not*
12but it's perfect
6you'll have to so I can update it
6cuz I missed something
12I wish the military still used the VADS. It's a great anti-air system.
12Vulcan's a transformer!
12Vulcan Air Defense System
3You know, you can go to the bank and ask for $100 in pennies, melt it down, and sell it as scrap for $700-800
14Technically, I am a Titanium dragon, but since I have more metal in me, I am classified as a Metal dragon.
12LOL OK
12?
What is it with religious people, and killing people virtually, or weapon obsessions? O_o
14Love the Vulcan Miniguns. <3
3Hey! I'm an atheist and I do that!
07wasn't the one in Colusseum technically a shadow suicune o3o
7I see. Hmm. Dari, help me enhance my flamethrowers and blowtorches
7I need them to be at around 1800-2000 celsius
3You mean can of axe and a lighter?
2shush
That would be illegal.
12Yeh but it wasn't the same type as Shadow Lugia
2it wasn't an XD
2XD
3Why?
And you wouldn't make that much.
6yeah but not in the XD project
6read my mini-fan story there
12Updated it yet
12?
3It costs 8 cents in scrap metal to make a penny
2I love how...
2steely
2they look
6that fancomic has been in my mind for YEAAARS
2and the aura :D
6not yet, one sec
14Unless you can get the heat to 2500 degrees F, you wont melt me.
/me drops Vulcan into the sun.
14*immune to that type of godmodding* >.=.>
6there
7 2500 F is 1371C. I can do that with my flamethrowers now
12Says the metal dragon.
6it's really not horribly noticable
6but
6it looks better now
6...
6FFFFFFFF NO IT'S NOT
6wtf happened to that :|
12?
7Master Bate
Good night
and hi
D:
12Wow shinies on the ribbons!
04gnight
bye Xeli
/me snugs
04hey NS
and Drake
14I'm not a sue, alright? I cant bend and manipulate EVERY element like a purple dragon. -.-
why the fuck are you still here
12and the crest thinbg
There are pen lasers that can light things to over 3000°F
12That looks better :3
7there's other ways to be a sue
That technically is a sue
04you always ask that
14then Spyro is a sue.
04and my answer is always the same 'My sister is taking ages to get ready'
hi
SNEAS
7ooh. That's a point. I could get one of those industrial lasers they're designing to spear through a blast door.
/me snugs
14I aint perfect...Not everything goes the right way for me.
2o3o
:3
12he's the purple dragon though
Drake
Yes, but he was a sue way before the term 'sue' was invented
you're also slow
:3
04...
6yup
6k
7Neo: no he wasn't
6updating a second time -_-
04why did my mind take that another way?
7in the insomniac games he was alright
Don't contradict me!
Class soon
you're taking too long to come
I would probably call them awesome wall-mounted £500,000 14z0r beams of death, rather than 'pen lasers'. :P
7then don't be stupid
:3
D:
/me snugs Sneas
I hate late classes, this one last from 6:30pm to 9pm
6seriously, if you see what I fixed (not added, fixed), you're saintly
>:
lasts
Wow, you don't need to be an asshole... Lighten up
7if only teh almighteh Th0ngz was here
04NS isn't that a GOOD thing?
6updated
7he could out-laz0r all of us
12Yeh I see
/me 14takes a small cube of Gold and manipulates it into a small Statuette of himself. ^.=.^
12You know it's funny, you do exactly what I do
lolGB
cum*
6._.
o.o
12Upload something, look at it for a few mins then realise there's something wrong/missing
6yup >_<;
12and keep doing that till it's right XD
/me pawns it.
7how can you manipulate metal like that? it's not forging, for that you need heat. You can't just take a solid object and manipulate it like that
6ok...
12lol dari
12He's suppose to be perfect
6 3rd update >_<;;;
Alchemy...
Acid?
My friend's karate instructor is actually Master Bates.
7acid would just corrode it
lolWUT
12LOL!!!
Corroding is a type of manipulation...
12lol
12If it helps, I didn't notice anthing wrong the first few times :3
it's like
on cue
Fair enough
6I wanted to fix this like 10 minutes before I even finished
14My powers of that are like Alchemy...but not quite. I just bend the material structure of the element into the shape I want.
7yes, but it's not manipulating in this way
/me cancome on cue :3
6but I felt like it could stay
/me hides and dies
xD
6but I can't stand it anymore
Alchemy = turning stuff into gold, not manipulating its form.
NANOBOTS!!!
14FMA is BS then.
FMA is?
6THERE
7see, now that's Sueing. You give a half-assed explanation in answer to a power that defies even the liberal laws of physics of a world which includes dragons
14nevermind...
2Roara
Can't dragons have nanobots?
14Hey, Dragons are mythical...the physical being of in this world doesnt even make sence...but it exsists.
6...
2why do I feel like the ribbon is longer, adn that the grass was not there before?
6oh what the heck
2o-o
6it didn't even update..
I would choose the Toolgun from Garrysmod...
6....OH WHAT THE HECK
6IT DIDN'T EVEN SAVE LOL
7there was a guy in Chuck called Colonel Sanders.
2... XD
12what's this talk about updates?
12I thought there was no difference there..
7whoo! Gmod!
I would be able to weld anything to anyone, spawn anything I want... Delete things...
6yeah it updated, but I forgot to save so I essentially uploaded the same exact file
6redoing
/me killed chat :3
2SHINY
2 8D
6that
6should
6do it
2IT'S SHINYYYYYY
My second choice would be the staff from Star Fox adventures...
7also, the toolgun is useless without the tools that go in it, which are seperate things. and it doesn't spawn things in the way you mean it besides things like thrusters. which you can't use, because they're seperate from the gun
The toolgun is a single object
10It's been killed for a while now :3
Sure, it can't spawn things
7right. _Read_what_I_write_
But all the tools are inside it, and that's good enough for me
:<
/me bye :<
When I said spawn, I mean ropes, wires, baloons...
7also, the toolgun is useless without the tools that go in it, which are seperate things. and it doesn't spawn things in the way you mean it besides things like thrusters. which you can't use, because they're seperate from the gun
7Read it over and over until you actually understand what it says
12?
07o3o
I understand
6eh?
Is it even possible to get the toolgun without all the tools in anyway...?
Haha.
You misunderstood what I meant
Exactly
All the tools are in the toolgun
o-o
D:
bye Sneas ;;
7No, but they're still seperate. He said one thing
It's a single item
7stop being unhelpful dari
2i hated the hotel i was staying at untill i saw the room number i was in .-.
No, they're not separate

7Hydro Thunder is kickass
What are you people doing >:C
12Yes, it is. And there's a butt load of stuff to do.

3What kind of stuff are you talking about?
3WHat do you end up memorizing?
12Cheat codes,
14I got here like, an hour ago. . . . Because I'm amazing like that.
7Icy: are you talking ones like number codes or punny words that have to do with the cheats?
07o3o
3I never used cheats in GTA
12The buttons.
12No, button combonations.
what?
7oh. then no
But icechat shows +G as on
o.O
Well
it isn't
7I can't do combos of any kind, except out of sheer button-mash luck
7Hmm...
huh
weird
7you [censored]
7I've gotta stop instinctively checking my dA.
7Not until this art piece is done!
7anywho, it is now officially tommorow.
7cya
3Try playing street fighter or SSB for a while
rawr
7anywho, it is now officially tommorow.
12I guess I just have quick hands...
14I'm art procrastinating, too.
bye
7also, SSB has no combos.
For though.
Later.
3You will be able to play ANY game with combos
Bon soir, carbon units.

lol
:P
That sounds... quaint.
/me plays with RDX's modes
12NO!
12Not at all.
12Neo, at least you're a bit nicer than he is.
I'm so immature it makes me laugh.
12I usually a stop talking while he's here or b use the ignore function on him
^same
3I will take that as a compliment
3There's an ignore button!
3Where?
12facepalm

"tongue tingler" LOL
"Narcissistic Fibrosis."

12yeah he does that a lot to try to get you to argue against him
3No hotlinking :P
3CPU: Intel Pentium Dual E2200, 3.58 GHz, 1024 KB (0% Load)
i'm OC'ing
lol not much
:o
12Why?
12Because!
12HAHAHAHA
really the cpu is clocked at 2.6ghz
lol
and the bus is running at 1300mhz
3If I had a website, I would put a hotlink block on it too
mine is the exact same
@clock
3Get a couple thousand more views
i have the cpu multiplyer Set lower
it's at x6
atm
instead of x11
techincally
i'm not overclocking the BUS at all
it can handle up to 1333mhz
as this board is designed for qaud cores
07kbatteryrunninglowbai
that need that bus speed
i'm just using my boards power to it's fullest
:x
6when's he leaving?
3Too soon?
anyways it's fun seeing GTA SA load in under 10 seconds
6birthdayfeesh
12It's been a year...
12Plus... he was awesome...

12;D
3Spelling fail?
i plan to increase my cpu speed up to 3ghz
3Or was it?
as it worked out fine for about 2 months like that
though the bus speed wasn't this high
3For all we know... deferbaderbs is a real word...
12bhvccfydreuyiuopio
3Syllable pronunciation failure...
3Well, on my part... Cause I don't know how to say that...
12Rawr?

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181169/1282602213542.jpg
12he's normally online just not today
XD
12He died, along with the forum. <:L
3It's too bad he doesn't care about the forums...
3It wouldn't take much to get it more active. Just merge many of the topics together to condense the conversation more
3People would talk in it alot more often
12pretty much the only thing that will wake it up is an announcement of a spyro game etc
LOL
3Most of it isn't about Spyro anymore though
3 90% of the conversation is in the general chat
12And it's about Justin Bieber...
12Repost the link
12Link failed...
12>.<
3XD
3Hotlinking is bad for your health
12http://www.epicfail.com/page/12/ >.> well its here

12You bet I'm back.
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11062708
3Wow, I suck at Torque...
12http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/silly-irc-user-posts-many-news-links-4893934
12People join everyday, yet we have so little members....
/me pokes in
3Because most don't realize it's inactive
hi Curly
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1181169/1282602213542.jpg
you missed it
3So they make an account and then disappear
12If only we had a successful reunion.... maybe...
hey :)
CLAP YERRR HANDS
I've seen that before ^^
oh
sorry
3I wish they would announce another game
3Maybe a fan-made game?
12Maybe...
12I've never heard of Torque. That, or it's just because I've never played it.
3Torque isn't a game. It's a game engine
3You make games with it. Like Gamebuilder, but more... Professional?
3Like the Source engine or the Unreal engine or the CryEngine
3Check it out:
3http://www.torquepowered.com/
no
Fallout 1
the first, original game
3You know the game Tribes?
3The engine was based off of that game
though I'm kinda a fan of Civs, Fallout, and Dawn of War
12Odd.
3I say I suck at it because I can't understand any of the code I'm reading
12I'll just stick to modding Battlefield 1942.
3Wow, 8 posts without interruption...
3It's basically the same
ah
3Just you need to make your own assets and scripts
6WHEEEEE
6done
3How do you make expressions like that?
and some god of war
/me 12throws a sea urchin at icy
3Yea, like that. How do you do that?
12AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
so.... am I the only one who doesn't like the new network name? >.>

3Lol
3Wrong person IcyD
"Using spare parts from the warthog, we'll build a Griff cannon. Utilizing the power of the Griff cannon, we'll punch a Griff sized hole in the wall.... or paint it a really nasty color."
2@_@
/me 12is awake.
Thanks for the warning.

o.o
Keep guessing.
ive never seen her before
teletubies
ummm
*Teletubbies

she's RDX's girlfriend
ah
No, lol.
oh
I know
Scott Pilgrim

it truly is an epic of epic epicness
umm
o.o me? older?
lol
XD no, the movie
:P
ummm
errr
hint?
The Idiot. :P
:O
That's the hint, not the answer.
You saw it!
oh
The... Jerk!
Yes.
:P
:D
/me stares...
What did you think?
I agree
I think the dialogue was perfect
well its either that or the Expandables
"One... two... three... fourfivesix!"
I also saw The Expendables days ago.
XD
/me bonks him upside the head "cease your staring child"
I love the part when the guy says the N word
Yeah, yeah.
and he gets offended and goes all karate on him
"You happen to be in the presence of a N!"
/me D:
XD
/me goes off and cries ;~;
You know the jungle bunnies.
For those of you who haven't seen it
the guy is white
Ah yes, they''ll eat the vegetables.
and he thinks he's black
/me sends a minion of peeps after him
"He hates these cans!"
That was my favorite part
"Stay away from the cans!"
Other than when he "doesn't need" all those things at the end.
XD I love how the guy decides to kill him
XDDD I love the "I do need this" part
what movie is this?
and the part with "Led by my faithful dog"
and he's dragging the dog
"Navin. R. Johnson... sounds like a run-f-the-mill d ouche."
*run-of-the-mill
/me myars
I'm curious, does Navin mean naive or something?
It sounds like it could.
probably does
But yeah, the dog part was great also.
And his "Special Purpose."
/me squirm o.o
XD
His special purpose
wasn't the dog's name "shit head" or something?
Mhm.
Because he thought the dog was warning him of a fire so Naving ot everyone up, and there ended up being nothing.
XD
He was going to name it "Ol' Lifesaver" but some guy said to call it "Shathead."
*Navin got
Yeah, haha.

Mel Gibson
ha
He sure has his rantpants on.
he does
meh
he's a human, it happens
Anything since his outburst roughly two months ago?
Oh, I know. But it's funny to me.
:o
he argued with his wife on the phone and the recording of it got out
because he's rich and famous and ppl broad cast it?
like two weeks ago
He's also evidently vehemntly racist, sexist, and thinks his ex-wife doesn't have a soul...
it happens every day o.o *failed to see humor* maybe im mssing the punch line..
But hey, he's human, right? xD
*vehemently
yah
hmm
Oh, don't forget horny.
It ties in with the rage.
o.o

\D:/
Bah, I didn't like Braveheart.
/me just likes being entertained
Braveheart 2: Revolutionary War Edition
hmm
That's true. But he evidently is anti-semetic, as they accused him in '04. xD
/me shrugs
that's actually not my joke
whatever
/me wanders off
my history teacher said that in class once
It's still funny.
yeah
Oh, okay.
hey luzi
I did like Braveheart though
partly because I like Scotland
They need a remake of Braveheart with Gerard Butler. xD
XD
oh well that' him and his life, i don't care as long as it wontt involve me, cartu or my fam xD
It could affect them.
Dun dun DUN.
cartu = RDX?

:cries: my tummy hates me
Alright, I feel the need to say this because so many people assume I am female... I am a /GUY/.
hi shy who's a guy~
:D
/me is kind of of the "guy unless your nick's obviously female or proven otherwise" >.>
type of person*
yay paperwork is done :D
yeah i slept a bit
Ah lol :)
i assume everyone is a guy unless they tell me otherwise
Ha, me too usually... But for some reason people like to assume I am a chick.
well, I just think if someone has an obviously female nick then they want to be treated as a girl so whatever floats their boat
lol
Hello
Are you saying I have a female sounding nickname, Curly? x.x
7blah blah blah, Mister Freeman
no, I said "obviously" :O
/me stays mute
Sure. Sure you did.
as in like if you were nicked ... Catherine or whatever then I'd treat you as a girl. non-proper nouns like... Curly and CootieMonster and Shy are automatically male >.>
i know a chick who likes to be called shy
7type 'ill' into the youtube search bar - one of the suggestions is 'illuminati killed michael jackson'
Well then, thats good Curly! :)!
XD
Lol ><
I think Shy's a cute nick though, for a guy or a girl ^^
oh
I need to test youtube anyway
my internet just got upgraded
so hopefully it doesn't suck anymore
not even a giggle sheesh
7my computer, despite being apparently invincible, has imploded

7I have a theory on it
how are you still here then?
/me giggles
7oh, family computer
/me has never giggled on the internet >.>
oh okay
the black knight always triumpohs!
7my theory is, in an alternate dimension Chuck Norris' face inhabited the same spatial dimensions as my computer. He sneezed a group of trans-universe micro-blackholes, one of which hit my computer and is slowly destroying it
yer arm's off
no it isn't
what's that then?
hahaaha
it's just a flesh wound
lol
so dark matter then?
monty python :O
yep
/me only knows that by anecdote though, never actually watched any monty python >.>
:O
Monty Python pwns
shame on u kari-chan
>:
/me makes kari-chan watch monty python
7no. a micro-blackhole
the use of the word "spam" as it's used online comes from them
I always saw it in the library but the covers on the dvd cases and the name of it just always seemed so boring :X
7like I said
mmhm, spam tuna!
it is faaar from boring
it's hillarious
BlackKnight: Have you seen Life of Brian?

7where have I heard his voice before?
I thought it sounded familiar too
7what was the original one that that was paordying? o_O
7...parodying*
it's just parodying the trailer for that new facebook movie
called Social Networking I think
7.... a facebook movie? that's probably the only thing that surpasses a Justin Bieber movie in uselessness
yep
a movie about the guy who made it :/
7the youtube one looks more interesting
I agre
I would actually go see the youtube one
:P
7I /might/ go see the facebook one for the same kind of reasons people watch those shows which show surgery and shit like that
to make yourself feel grossed out?
7... no. why would anyone do that?
I dunno
7I would think some kind of morbid fascination
I never watch shows like that, so I dunno why people do
ah
so like a guilty pleasure combined with curiosity?
ahhh
like that
I see what you're saying now
6Anyone alive?

It sort of is

7they're not clones of each other. That would cause degredation of their DNA and make them fall apart. They're all clones of the same DNA sample Jango Fett gave them

If you look into it, the science of Star Wars is pretty crappy.
They're supposed to be the exact same gentic code.
*genetic
7right
I mean, you can even hear explosions and other sounds in space.
Hahaha.
7you can't perfectly clone something. The perfect cloning process multiplies something by 2. The Kaminean process multiplies it by 1.999999, so eventually if they cloned clones they'd begin falling apart. They nipped that in the bud by keeping a hold on the sample Jango Fett gave them
7that's why the Asgard died out in Stargate. They didn't think to keep a hold of their original bodies.
Right.
I actually remember them, they were pretty awesome.
Thor's Hammer, lol.

I've been.
I watched the first three. I have the rest on Netflix.
7no. It's only marginally better than Infinity.
Well, can we all agree Atlantis was vomit?
7The X-304s were designed to take down Orri ships. EVIL ancients with ships designed around giant l4z0rz. before that, they were X-303s which were deisgned to take down Goa'Uld ships. In the first episode, the Lucian alliance manages to slip past an X-304 using old run-down Goa'Uld ships. What?
7and Atlantis was alright until they got rid of Weir
I stopped watching just before they killed her.
7Sam did not fit in with Atlantis
SG1 FTW anyway.
7they probably got the best person in the guy who plays the Doctor from Voyager
7which reminds me, it was awesome when they did that little shout-out to the Doctor in Doctor Who

When was that?

Oh, lol.

Hehe, Kitten, I hope you don't ever change
You're so unique in a beautiful, beautiful way -- there's no one quite like you :3

hi Night!
o.0
:O
hello
/me sits next to Kitten
No lonely Kittens
/me gets wet from the water thats spraying off of Ari and hisses
^-^
lol
/me is precious?
/me blow drys Kitten
/me sneezes
lol
Kitten: very precious :)
/me had a very eventful drive home
Kitten: Did I tell you about it? :o
I avoided an accident
Someone pulled out in front of me going like 5 MPH and I was going like 62 MPH
oooooh! should've run the person over *nods*
And .... well.. my brakes work >.>
you better have been wearing your seat belt!
And so I went to the gas station to get something to drink, and as I was leaving, an older man asked me if I know how to get to a certain place 10 minutes in the other direction
Kitten: I was, but my cell phone wasn't on the seat next to me
Slammed my cell phone into the dash board
>.<
did it break?
Don't think so
But anyway!
/me giggles
Someone asked if they could take me up to place in the other direction that I just came from
And being the big softy I was, I said sure, and let him in
And I drove him up 10 minutes in the other direction to a bar he wanted to go to >.>
you shouldnt do things like that
I know :(
But I'm a big softy
he could've had a gun or a knife and took your head!
D:
then i'd be without an aniki *cries*
/me wants to help people :(
And I took him up there and he was like "how much do you want for that?" and I was like "it's fine, it's on me"
and possibly lose your life :(
I sowwies
He looked like a guy low on his luck though, and he said that he owned a plumbing business a while back, but he had to quit it to take care of his mother, who broke her back :(
and now he's spending all his money at a bar?!
Nuh uh
He didn't have but like a few dollars on him
He can't get a drink with that
He just wanted to get out of the house and chat with people
so he more likely use the women
:(
He was a good guy :(
And told me that he didn't regret a thing, because if there was one thing in this life that's important, it's your family
i'll give him the benefit of the doubt
He just needed some fresh air
just be more careful Ari
I don't know, it made me feel good doing something nice for someone else :)
I AM MAN
HEAR ME RAWR
Because, I mean, if we can't help other people, if we don't leave a positive impression in the lives of the people we influence, what else is there?
/me bites Ari
I know, I know, it's unsafe, but I ... I just want to help people :(
don't go all presidential on me mister
/me giggles
lol
he's like that Kitten
Kitten has me figured out xD
Night trust me i know, but i'll hurts him. he knows it
:3
Kitten: I value your thoughts though, and I'll be more careful in the future
good he needs some guidence
/me glares at that sentence feeling very much like she was voting for something or a citizen who brought a concern to the president's attention -_-
I'm sorry Kitten
Habit :x
lol

uh huh.
i dunno if i want to accept your apology..

Adult is sitting next to me...I'm worried.
CHILD
BREASTS.

XDDD I'll show her that.

*A
I meant the Stormalong reference. And no, but she's holding a TV remote
Oh, yes.
*as
xD
Does she get it?
Welcome back!
I have no idea what you are talking about
._.
Nope. :P
hi
The above evidences it.
Stormalong harbor?
Bingo.

It's not a nerd thing.
What is that off of i know i know it but just cant put my finger on it
Lawl.
:D
hey
/me is conversing with RL.
-
RL?
old friend of ours
Haha, yup.
An enemy.
hey
Who is impersonating who I'm impersonating.
Yeah, he goes "Found this in my old comp. Went back for the memories."
Back when they were in bed togehter they exchanged passwords.
*rogether
*Together
.....LOL
Wait what
did that really happen!!?!?
It's an expression.
Calm down. xD
....oh
dammit
thank God.
XDD
*Dammiy
XDDDDD
LOL
oh and RL messaged me
Dammiy?
XD
he didn't message me
:(
"Hey beb."
Quit using my stuff
XDDD
hi
I acknowledged him using NPL's account and he said it wasn't meant to be a disguise
Lawl.
It wasn't.
he's probably going through all her messages in her inbox XDDD
I bet.
Damn, there's private stuff in there.
shit.
Woah...
She still talks to RL, he says. But infrequently.
I havent talked to her in at least a year
I disabled getting her updates on facebook because I was sick of her putting her status as the lyrics to bulletproof
LOL
XD
Her mannerisms are surely annoying lately.
like what
The way she acts in the present.
giggle giggle jumppp jummp all time lowwwww(:
I wish I knew more. She almost came over a month ago.
errr
Proto**
almost?
Yeah. Had to go somewhere with her family and was too busy with band to reschedule.
she decided that this time she'll bulletproof
so she didn't come
She hangs out with my sister.
duh
:(
:P
that makes a lot of sense...
Which part, lol?
/me revives and heals Proto
hanging out with your sister
/me gives Kitten a chicken sandwich
Mmm.
I have an idea.

Oh?
LOL
That'd be a meeting of the ages.

Then we create a show, with them as the antagonist trio.
I kind of want to cut the chit chat with RL and just go "BEGONE, FOUL DEMONSPAWN!"
XDDDD
did you all know about this network merger?
why not do just that?
I'm going to.
i was here when it happened i didn't know til it was going on
I'm making forced Gaga references in our conversation
lol
I noticed.
changing the world, one sequin at a time
:P
Do you actually like him?
XD
who, RL?
No, Lady Gaga/
yeah
He responded: "...?"
XDDDDD I meant in me and RL's conversation, but I'm doing it here too.
Wow, his sense of humor seems to have evaporated.
he asked "Lady Gaga FTW?"
XD
How can you guys actually like Lad GooGoo?
wait, I'm a pedophile now?
Duh.

I didn't mean /that/ kind of like.

Of course.

I do my best not to let them get sucked into the world of heroin.
"Deugs'll end you, boy." XD
*Drugs'll
Don't do school, stay in drugs
:P
lol
There was this little motivational sticker for staying above the influence, and scribbled on top of it was "I'm so high rite now."
LOL
XDD
I took that as a witty statement, since high is to above.
though they probably didn't have that in mind
Stay above the influence... Stay high
No.
They had molten unicorns on the mind.
roll the windows down let the smoke get thicker~
you know what they say... where theres smoke... they pinch back...
They say that?
I never heard them.
only you can prevent forest fires
that used to be the standard youtube poop intro
"Only you can douse forest fires via urination... though being male may help."
XD
XD
LOL
That is quoted, but it is original as of ten seconds ago.
mayday mayday! we cant find the hose!
"Mayday! Mayday! The radio's broken!"
ha
Who what when where how why?
enough with the consecutive oneliners.... give me lazer cake!
hey who is louve anyway?
isnt it suppose to be louvre
Yeah.
But it's just a name.
louve is the owner of darcHoods
ah
the network we just merged with
whats darc hoods?
ah
The best I can say for it was that it wasn't as bad as I thought
at first though it was me who was thinking it was bad
you had high hopes for it at first
It hasn't seemed to change anything.
you got paid a little more for doing nights didnt you?
I'm not sure
:\
per hour
hmm
what's the differential for you Infamous?
dont know
new people that started getting hired started out with more than i made when i started
dont you two have like a week left now?
three days
:D
Until what?
we can be together again
we move in
the world ends...
in school
Oh, right.
XD at all the different answers
in the order
For some reason I thought you were already there.
Be together -> School -> end of world
O.o
crap... i forgot to do my classes..
Oh, there's new development in the Rick Roll bid topic.
They asked for what to type in to find the video, so I gave them all of these ridiculous tags to search.
My supervisor probably thinks I left
XD
People still think there's a PG-13 trailer.
the other three college age remodel workers left last Friday
really? I was losing faith in their gullibility.
And they still believed that, evidently. Except Fleur.
:P
xD Do you have any green people on the shift?
Well except Tom
But he's not a store employee
ah
Why are you green?
i'm the youngest still in my store...
I'm not green
XD
:(
i think there is one person on my shift that has the last name greene
was directed at your coworkers
go green the right way
XD she does not
:P
Yeah
and wears a chainmail bra
XD
Even Elmo is green these days.
I actually have pink hair
And flourescent orange skin
/me has lost all feeling in his pinky for some reason.
xD
D:
Do not get the california skin
please
XDD
have lighter hair than your skin
Well, if she had green hair and orange skin she could be an Oompa Loompa.
the spray on stuff that makes people look like carrots
But that's not the case.
LOL
Maybe I should dye my hair blue
Lighter hair than skin
ew
Like that Scott Pilgrim girl
:P
lol i remember someone that did that on my shift
:P
oh really
mhm
RAMONO FLOWERZ
oh that movie
Have you already sen tihs movie?
*Ramona
:P
nah
but I read about the comics
whoa
I still haven't seen it. I became disillusioned after seeing the trailer.
And I'm sure it couldn't beat The Other Guys.
and I hear that it follows the comics really closely
That was too well done.
I can't wait to see it
I'm not sure I will se tis moveh.
*tihs
if she agrees that is
:P
If not, you have rope.
D:
wait what?
/me is not that kind of boyfriend
Dude, you don't even take her hostage? Talk about bad communication in a relationship.
chicks like being abducted... i mean its almost a cliche!
I prefer tying my men up.
Then you have women such as Princess Peach who are just hopelessly peril-stricken.
holy crap! someone that is openly into S&M
XD
Ok it should be working now....
whipping haus
it was last time too
Excellent
dead chat
Oi
chat whipped to death
not dead
oh
That's sexy.

XD
:D
everyone! WHIP HIM!
no!
lol
/me pulls a dagger out of #draconicwolves's back, dripping with IRC blood.
Now I can op easy on the go as well as on my phone.
holy shit pleather whips!
/me wonders what kind of bizarre direction this has taken.
plenty of pleather will please the plight politely
Haha
Pleather whips have been known to plant plexiglass parishes.
/me nods sagely.
this channel should be renamed SAndMCorner
with the direction it just took at least
is that why you come here all the time?
SaM's Corner.
no it isn't Infamous :P
lol SaM's club! lol
Hahaha!
WaltonLand
Wally World.
welcome to SaM's club *cracks whip* have a nice day...!
hahaha
Sam's club is where I got all my ramen, Easy Mac, and Spaghettios in bulk
it was intended to be for school
wish we had one here or a cost co
but most of it is gone already
lol
wow
it's actually cold enough here to need a sweatshirt
/me likes this
hm?
this summer has been a really hot one
It's still hot here. :/
and now it's actually cold
/me has his windows open
i wear a muscle shirt and shorts regardless of weather
I've had my millions of fans going.\
And cheering me on.
lol
:P
LMFAO
OK guys
Hm?
If you care about what's happening with the merge
in which case come back to your part of it
oooh
You might want to read this
http://lists.epic-chat.net/pipermail/epic-chat/2010-August/000047.html
/me pays attention
/me merges about what happens with the care.
And everyone here is welcome to join #open-staff to share your opinions
Lol, Sr pretends not to recognize me.
That's rich.
*SR
?
fail
Nothing, on another chan.
there's no way he couldn't recognize you
you were there every day
=/
xD I know.
It's fine. I don't want to start trouble.
Me either
i want to!
me neither
wheres the bloody bugger at
I mean I do, but I can be mature sometimes.
but it still shocks me
...lol at SR going "yo"
XD
wait.... sr on an ipad?
failfailfail
I know right
He's trying to look cool among the bigwigs. :P
hahaha
i be rollin.. they hatin...
Yes, his sense of humor hasn't dried up quite yet.
tryin to catch me ridin dirty
*trollin'
"They catch me trollin'... they hatin'..."
*White and Nerdy
they think he's just too white and nerdy
Oi, you stole my line
D:
they see me mowin'
mah front lawn
I take things to the extreme, whiter than sour cream...
but you know they're all thinkin' I'm just too white and nerdy
I know javascript as well as clingon
I know all the words to my favorite theme songs, I dazzle you in a game of ping pong.
the only question I ever thought was hard was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard
I can recite it right now and have you R-O-T-F-L-O-L
So... I'm curious. What kind of community is Darc-hood? Is it affiliated with a forum like us?
darchood is a network
epic-chat isn't affiliated with a forum
we are a channel
I'm aware it's a channel, lol.
darchoods is an entire network
or at least the part of us that's associated with a forum is a channel
And when I say us, I mean #draconicwolves.
They don't have a forum either
But they have several channels that are affiliated with forums
well darchood isn't exactly correspondent to draconicwolves
/me nods.
I never said it was.
I'm so misread all the time, haha.
You guys made SR start ranting
D:
/me is innocent
ha
Someone press his off button
:P
/me should interrupt to suggest a network name
:P
He's not bothering me like I thought he'd be.
I just feel like a pleibian.
LOL
Haha.
it sound be darc-chat or something
His presence always makes things slightly more awkward for me, I dunno =/
Yeah, we were going to name it darc-chat
it just makes me slightly more annoyed
but also awkward
that was the name most of us agreed on
:P
Name it SaM's Club
name it linking park
I think it should be #darconicwolves. That way we only have to change two letetrs around.
Name it Walmart!
:D

No thanks
D:
omg infa z shut the fuck up in there lol
XD
Yeah
You're making him keep talking
:P
i wana see if he can ramble on and on about his crap
well dont
He can
oh he can
LOL I come back to a soliloquoy from SR about GPS.
that has been confirmed
XD
this is one of the reasons you annoy me over half the time your on
your so fuckin boring
hahahaha
everyone shh
See how long he'll monologue
/me shhhs
i do
You're not boring
i wana see if he can carry a conversation withoutme
yeah exactly
XD
bet he can
I'm just pissing him off by feigning tech ineptness.
XD
Apps to create matter
XDDDD
"Huh"
Lol
Look at it's name.
how do you think of this stuff dude?
XD
*its
/me shrugs.
XD
It comes with the insanity package.
/me is trying not to wake his family with his lols
Ha, he ignores it of course.
lol
brb
maybe he hasn't forgotten you after all then
:P
he knows you're never serious
I find it hard to believe that he did.
I think he was just pretending not to know me because I embarassed him when I entered.
I seriously doubt it
Mhm.
He doesn't ask "who is this" to every other "new" person he sees
XD
oh nevermind then
I'm not on right now, but I'm there most days that I'm here.
if you didn't I was going to say that he was just complaining about how many people he's lost
XD
Which is basically eveyr day.
"Is he from my forum or something?"
Dude, I'm trying to seem tech inept.
I can't help you.
argue with him that you can talk into it like a webcam
hahaaha
isn't the next iTouch able to do that?
or was it something else?
Look ar what I wrote.
*at
XD
XDDDD
He did, to be fair, give me a "Lol."
yup
I guess I just have to be in the right mood. But out of the 75% or so hit-and-miss, I'm funny sometimes/.
Lulz: The Good Kind!
XD
I'm going to act all attached to him now.
Yeah he's totally going to think I sent you guys in here to troll him
oh crap
I'll stop.
I said XD in the wrong channe;
Didn't think of that before
it was too funny to think of that XD
Okay, I'm done.
I don't want to get you any flak.
That's OK
It was funny though
XD
Hehe.
app to create mass... XD
You crack me up
It's the "Transform this, Newton!" app.
XD
i got an app that does the same thing! its called pizza!
Can I say "Wait... that was the email? I think I just ate it."
*?
Do it
you already look like a troll
why stop now
xP
/me puts on his "Could go either way" face.
I just remembered the link. xD
/me starts reading it.
XD
You don't know how badly I want to say "So.. my first question: What exactly is Epic-Chat?"
XD
haha
goodnight
gnite
aw
That was abrupt.
Oh, well.
I'm currently cracking up at my pictures of deranged cousin.

Im afraid to join channels I dont join regularly
How else do you join a new channel?
by not joining them
xD You'd stay here in this one little channel forever because you're anxious?
no because I'm afraid of being yelled at
if that counts as anxious then yes
No one will yell at you
Why would getting yelled at on IRC be scary? :P
they're nice
RL is back on OFF
/me is bored
anyone wanna play internet pool with me
/me is also a board.
Not really. :/ But stay, things will get fun when people arrive.
i'm off to bed
D:
Alrighty.
alright
lol
XD
Dammiy, why can't more aliens come?
I want to get into epic conversations with the weird species.
:P
:O
;_;
brb

Not quite sure what to do with myself atm
you can talk
or twiddle
or wink
or baa
All very valid suggestions.
lol
silliness
There... fixed that again. >.<
Hai :o
Hello there.
a rose by any other name just isn't the same
Welcome back.
Kitten! :D
/me gently paws Kitten!
shes supposed to be asleep
O.o
D:
Awww
anything on anyones mind. i need to stay engaged so i can keep my mind off stuff
I'm going to go play something D: Sorry
Bai!
what are you gonna play
/me is really getting tired of not being able to connect to this network :/
D:
make it better please D:
What error, did it give?
connection refused.
What port?
And I just change ports
And eventually it works
Even though it originally refused a connection on this port
Which port?
I'm on 6667 right now
and what port were you using?
6668
and 6666
and they also work
sometimes
I used them before with no issues
6668 by default
6667 is for No-SSL and SSL is 6697
rite
That is
What?
Are you using SSL?
I don't know
anyway, 6667 is the standard port :P
See, I'm on 6667 now, but if I tried to connect on it to begin with, it'd refuse the connection, then I'd try 6668, 6666, then 6667 again, and it might work, if not keep switching, and one of them will work randomly

Uh
Bumped up arrow

Are you running a firewall?
I would assume so
I've changed no settings on my computer though
And had no issues before
Except since a couple of days ago
hmm
:/
hmm indeed
darchoods
FML
</ignore> ^

we had problems with the linode servers
everything should be okay now
oh wtf -.-
uhhhhhhhhh
/me pokes back Shy and run away..! :P
RAWR!
Anyone home?
Guess not. :/
im here just not in a good emotional state :sigh:
/me hugs back ty
Hai!
Aww
just going through a bad relationship issue having a hard time coping with the end
Hey.
Need me to beat anyone up for you?
no i just need to talk to ppl have a distraction etc
/me babbles on like an idiot.
That help any? :P
We already /played/ bable like an idiot.
*babble
Oh.
Hmm....
lol
/me tries to come up with something distracting.
silliness
/me sings FMLYHM
i love that song
no ive always wanted to so much
no its not
Okay, next question.
Has space ever been in you?
its not bad at all
what's your favorite color?
yes im full of space, between cells, betwean atoms etc
Correct.
sometimes green sometimes blue, partial to earthen colors
However, I'm talking space as in a vaccuum.
Not one that you clean carpets with.
before my existence i was vaccuus
Yes, there is a giant vacuum inside all men. It's called their stomach.
xD
Nice.
indeed mine feels like a pit atm
Wait, your stomach feels like your armpit?
Is it true you like my curls? :o
:P
not my armpit
just a pit of emptiness
like a knot
twined tight
I'm only kidding.
i haven't seen ur curls
It feels like a black hole that needs more cows, Bill.
indeed
mooo
Or more cowbell.
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pk1kPD3Gsw
So, how may we be of a sufficient distraction to you?
ur doing fine
What if stop entirely? What then? :o
then i sit here and continue trying to cope on my own
its easier with others
[insert further questioning here]
ask anything you wish
Okay. How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?
3 if ur an owl
Hm... how about a turtle?
probably the same hes got a beak just takes longer cuz his lick takes like a year
I want a pet turtle/
/me nods.
Turtles are pretty cool.
ive always wanted a parrot but now its too late cuz they live like 80 years
You could always take one that's already middle-aged from a pirate or something.
Although he might have some serious language.
true but normally they have been abused and neglected and can't trust or cope and they are already stress prone they need stability
Right, so you trap it in a laundry basket and don't feed them for four days.
not good
i know
just be ur goofy self i understan
I suppose.
lol
i wonder where the whole pirate/parrot thing started from
Probably because there were parrots on all the tropical islands that pirates stopped at.
sort of like how the modern notion of hell was invented in middle ages
So eventually one infamous one had a parrot as a pet, and it caught on.
probably but i wonder what literature specifically or lore made it a common stereotype
Me too. It's more than likely not known. Or maybe Hollywood cooked it up.
7GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY OFFICE
He says he doesn't like you.
I, don't like you either.
7I did set his face on fire
That would explain the falling shadows.
7nah, some douche put tripwires up everywhere
A trap set for something four times as heavy as us...
This was a last stand.
7no, this was a stag party
im googling trying to find citations
No, this is Sparta.
just ppl saying stuff without citations so far mostly attributing treasure island with most of it
7No, this is Patrick
Is this the Krusty Krab?
7No, this is Patrick!
Trasure Island may have popularized it, but it doesn't seem too unlikely that it has a historical origin.
Patrick, that's the name of the restaurant.
7Hold on, I didn't know the busses ran this late?
They don't...
one seemingly legit site posts that parrots were often used as trade or to bribe officials since they were exotic
I know one of the first things Columbus brought back with him were parrots.
7what's the third clue... green ooze coming out of the walls! No wait, they do that anyway
No, no it's "But what was that third thing?! The walls will ooze green slime?! No wait, they always do that."
7at least it was a Sea Bear and not a Sea Rhinoceros
Yeah, a dirt circle would never stand a chance against them.
7No, no it's "What attracts those?"
PAtrick adds what I just said, then Squidward asks what you said.
7ooh
7sorry
7I haven't seen any in a while
Lol, it doesn't matter.
7I do have that song from the marching band episode on my iPod though
7which is awesomesauceom
I just have them memorized somehow, even though I haven't watched the show in, like, two years.
Have you seen the Sick Spongebob video?
7no?
It's bizarre and borderline sadistic.
7have you seen that trailer for the Facebook gritty reboot movie and the youtube spoof?
Yes. xD
7the youtube spoof looks way more interesting
I know, right? As it always is.
so that could be one reason for the sterotype
Have you seen the Kane trailer?
+e
7no
Watch at your own risk (Sick Spongebob): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-3acYotCc&feature=channel
Indeed.
7I instantly have an aversion for it just from the thumbnail
You should. It's an unpleasant but necessary viewing.
Torrrrrent
downloading something specific?
Ah, you have Torrents Syndrome?
7people keep trying to convince me of that about two girls, one cup
/me is just being silly and making fun of pirates :p
XD
No. I'll never watch that.

Hahahahaha.
7is mayonnaise an instrument?
7it has to be said, the one time Squidwart wins he wins /spectacularly/
Yeah, that's true.
No, horse radish is not an instrument either.
7it's hardly a marching band, but still.
Well, they did discover what it truly means to be in a marching band.
7no they didn't
7they discovered how to be kickass, but not a marching band
IT IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER! TWENTY TWELVE! TWENTY TWELVE!
Lawl.
lol
7type 'ill' into the youtube search bar. one of the suggestions is 'the illuminati killed michael jackson'
7also, 'just bieber gets hit by water bottle'
Saw those.
The Bieber one was unsatisfying.
He needed to get hit like five times, minimum.
7ok. go to google. 'conspiracy theory the moon doesn't exist'
xD Is that the CH one?
7no. it's a real conspiracy theory
I think I've seen it.
It was a man-made satelitte or something?
7"That's no moon, that's a space-station!"
XD
7they believe it was a hologram or some shit
7black helicopters are micro-organisms
...Wot?
7some people believe black helicopters are alien life-forms, that start out as micro-organisms in the bloodstream
That's hilarious. Now, how about when we see people flying these black helis?
7the chaingun on the front is used during their 'juvenile' 1-3cm stage to inject people with more microorganism black helicopters
xD Of course.
7we're the only two people here
I don't know, I do that sometimes also.
:P
My hovercraft is full of eels D:
7anywho, I need to go post. my insane (but in a James Bond villain way) necromancer is going to revive someone
Very well then.
Quickly, what species?
Would you fondle my buttocks?
um....
/me hides
lol
For a price.
What'cha got?
7http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/heir may I suggest this flash game to you?
Never mind D:
Nah, you mayn't.

Oh, you would welch.
/me watched Vampire Sucks Iron Man 2 today :3
Put and somewhere between Vampire Sucks and Iron Man 2 D:
i wasn't impressed with iron man 2. i found myself annoyed a great deal at various parts
I liked the whips. :o
yes the effects were great
just the general atmosphere of the movie the personalities etc
was annoying
sort of like how they put the mom needlessly in transformers 2
and those two stupid bots
sort of like that
O.o
Ha, the stupid bots won't be back now. They were "racist."
oh, yay :D
/me hugs her new vhost
/me huggletackles Curly
oh wait
/me fallsover
thar we go ^^
:3
let's try that again
oh, yay :D
/me hugs her new vhost
/me noms eet.
I remember I used to have a vhost here <3
Don't remember what it was though :o
request another one and it shall be activated
i don't see any difference
oh. wait
xD
/me is an idiot
you're right, there is no difference, I was looking at the wrong thing in the whois list >.>
/me smashes a lamp.
hey, that was expensive :O
It was a gift.
doesn't that just make it worse?
Yes. >D
D:
I'm so evil, I have no eyes.
They were delicious.
/me <3s eyes
Glad they didn't go to waste.
you didn't put them in your pizza did you? I don't like pizza with eyes >.>
Of course not :o
good ^^
/me keeps nomming happily then
Psh, doesn't matter. You won't get any pizza.
I totally did :O
he emailed it to me
I emailed her a whole pizza!
:3
Then I will have to plunge it from your stomach.
why? D:
I linked the images to this channel too last night though D:
Because I'm evil, of course. My motives have no real basis.
/me gets to work.
motiveless evil is boring >:
Yeah, it is.
Which makes it all the more torturous for you.
XD
/me is truly neutral :3
Do I want that? D:
Do not want.
I don't think it's possible to be true neutral >.>
unless you're a cat :O
It isn't possible, for a humana nyhow.
*human anyhow
Felix has no shame, no honour, no dignity, no conscience!
xD
True neutral alignment is described as selfish interest in only profiting themselves and the ones one loves.
I think children are true neutral
well, really really young ones
mmmm... maybe up till 5
or 10 maybe
mmm... no 5 \
One is only designated neutral because they don't want to get involved. Their motives are there, they just aren't in play.
Would you really rate me as good or evil?
I rate you as... chaotic silly :O
Well, I am talking about the D&Dish alignments :p
Lawl.
D:
Fail.
I don't really know what to rate you as though
but you seem to be on the good side of the spectrum as far as I can tell
02[21:41:50] *** -HostServ- The vhost provided is too long.01
:(
Ha, the Life Force spectrum.
Are you of Fear, or are you of Love? xD
/me tried godlord.of.the.chaotic.realms.of.madness.that.are.the.mindscapes.in.my.head
I'm of... logic :O
/me has no idea what the life force spectrum is though
nice xD
It's just from a movie, never mind.
It was a fallacious argument that fear and love are the deepest of human emotions, and that any action can fit under those two categories.
too many ellipses today...
/me is probably of chaos or madness D:
well. I guess you could word any action to fall under either of those
you'd have to redefine love though
I disagree strongly.
Fear and love aren't even direct opposites.
do they have to be?
Essentially, for all motives, "good" and "evil", to fall under them, they would have to be.
fear and love have nothing to do with good or evil though >.>
wouldn't total lack of care for another person, be the opposite of love. not even hate just complete indifference, denial of someone else
That's my point.
In that argument they were.
ooooh
okay
that's really dumb
Like, as an example, they said "So and so finds a wallet, take some money out, then gives is back. Is that an example of fear or love."
*?
A love for money and a fear for getting caught.
But they made you pick one.
Which is stupid.
Most motives are far to complex to be boxed into two emotions.
*too
most emotions are too complex for that as well
Right.
All I'm doing is analyzing a fallacy.
well, I'll agree with you on most of that, although I think if you nail down the evolutionary roots of all actions then they all boil down to fear in the end
According to Yoda they do.
:P
what? >.>
"Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."
um.......... I'm not sure how that correlates to what I just said :X
Law, never mind. It was a joke.
*Lawl
continue not!
Time of hammer it is!
Suspend your current actions.
/me dances like Yoda
My timepiece indicates a necessity for mallets.
/me is curious how Yoda would dance.
my mallets are indicating a necessity for time, I think I'm doing something wrong D:
Hm, you could very well be "doin it wrong."
Well, where did these mallets come from?

7oh yeah, we've been taking the piss out of Vulcan for being a pedofork
7wanna join in?
oooo
hi Maser
12}:|
It's a song about a talking dog performed by some spoons. Of course I like Scooby Doo, but still
12Lol homospoons...
6Vulcan?
7now all I can think about is people playing that song on some spoons
7which is 4.5 kinds of awesome
14hm?
Spoons!<3
7you're an odd person
Have you only just realised it? :D
6You can't download music from Grooveshark,can you?
7No, but I feel it needs stating occaisionally
Oh, ok
14it's more like an internet Playlist, but to download it either takes you to Amazon MP3s or iTunes.
7such as when a person touches something frozen and exclaims that it's cold
6D:
Like a corpse?
...
Oh dear XD
7no. That's not frozen. People liken it to being frozen but if that were so I'm sure your fingers would get stuck to it quickly
7or, in your case, your tongue
Why would any sane person be licking a corpse?
7this is you, we're talking about
6I'll risk opening Limewire..
12DON'T!
6I'll probably brb again.. -.-
I don't tend to lick corpses
Don't lick corpses? Sound advice, Icy

The whole thing is flash based
So more like it couldn't handle it lol

Wait I know the cap
GRR
12*cynderhug*
/me lost the game.
The game version ~+1
Just imagine that ~ is a sideways 8
>>>
2,147,483,647
6*icyhug*
is the top number of hits it can handle^
I wasnt even close >..
But it probably didnt like getting 5 hits per second
lol
12;D
Thats the cap on flash so idk
/me 6tackles back
Would probably have to keep it to like once per second
12Hehehe.
http://www.redlynchsc.eq.edu.au/RSCWebSite/DOCs/Createdby.html
"The number 2,147,483,647 is also the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in computing."
HA
lemme try twice per second
There it goes
up up up and up up
This is great
/me crosses fingers for no crash

I'd overload my connection before theirs even broke a sweat tho
So I'd be DoS'ing myself
lol

Some rly bad flash scripting .. that counter lol
I enjoy logging on to an admin account and playing "never gonna give you up" on startup for all computers the last day of school
/me dosen't think they have fixed it
/me got it to 20. \o/
lol, I made a exe file that was disguised as GTA IV setup
Put it on a server
And it looks legit at first
But when you click continue, it removes all the close buttons n stuff, and starts playing a rick astley video
XD
/me pets Kitten.
But you can't close it lol
lol @ things
ctrl * alt * delete
Unless you know my password, or you restart the computer
Task manager is blocked for students
xD
/me 6lols at a pic

Aww. wget doesn't bump the counter up.

Who cares this could be fun
Because they can't script anything for shit?
:P
Things, get a job there
I am already better than my schools security guy

/me thinks he could learn a lot from you two. :D
Soo many lulz to be had if I get to the control panel

Unfortunately, they were smart enough to not have the username as Admin and pass as Admin
lol
In what way?
shutdown -i
>.>
haha
My school has CMD locked.
But you can still run batch files
:P
6Yus..

The only thing the school has done well is the internet filter
Although, every school in my state runs through the same internet filter
It's pretty much impossible to bypass :/
My school filter is good too, but we found one site that gets through.
unblockers.com.au
The filter seems to block everything lol
Even brand new proxies
all blocked somehow

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I know what minecraft is now
minecraft is a survival game where the environment's fully interactable and you can make items by combining things and there's ores to mine and trees to cut and monsters to kill or run away from
the world's randomly generated too
and it's 3x bigger than the Earth :O
it's only in Alpha mode though, no real multiplayer yet I think
my friend was multiplaying the other day
in Minecraft alpha?
I know there's a minecraft classic multiplayer
may have been classic
minecraft alpha's the one with all the monsters and things
minecraft classic is just building stuff
I made a house :D
I just bought the game, I have to wait a week for them to get my payment >.>
MarioMaster	bored 19:15	Proto	saem 19:16	Proto	someone made a giant minecraft calc 19:16	MarioMaster	did you ever get your pc fixed 19:16	Proto	yes

Mee!
Sure

On my desktop, I have utorrent running with webui enabled and a special iPad webui extention
my desktop also has an app for streaming transcoded video directly to my ipad
and my ipad has an app for watching that video as well as a utorrent webui thing.
my nexus one has a wifi tethering feature so internet doesnt cost any extra money per month on my ipad
with 6gb of data transfer.
Free movies and tv shows streamed directly to me.
from anywhere.
You can play tetris in uTorrent
:D

Im implatning the ability to easily connect to multiple IRC networks.
so your bot can connect tomultiple channels on multiple servers.

12icy lost the game though :D
3I found out how to win the game!
12:L
11orly?
3Yarly!
3See, the game is made so that the rules of that specific game must be followed ONLY when the game is in play (I.E. When you think about the game)
3So I invented "The Activity"
3Every time you think of the game, you will think of the activity. And the rule of the activity is that you win the game each time you think about it
11wtf?
3It's like an almost complete reverse of the rule that makes you lose the game!
12KISS ME!
3It's difficult to understand at first, but think about it a few times over and you'll get it =P
11dewd

Hello?
anyone online?
/me wonders what's up with people breaking into friends' houses for fun
got me
That's a good way to get shot :/
sure is
It's actually illegal over here for police to arrest the killer in cases like that too, except in limited circumstances
Also, what is up with the piercings that girls are getting in the side of their nose?
It's always like a single jewel bead thing and it's in the side of their nose
yea
I know what your talking about
It makes you wanna go like "Hey, I think you have something right ...... oh, nevermind, that's on purpose"
seems like a lot of people are getting them
And it's always the real nasty girls too
LOL
You know how they call lower back tattoos "tramp stamps"?
I propose that we call these things a "ho nose"
of course I know >_<
lol
/me wonders if someone beat him to it first
:O
/me invited that :D
Yay
only thing I wanna get pierced is my upper cartilage with a 1.5" bar
/me goes to trademark that
EW
but thats the ears so nothing to weird
1.5" is huge
long
That's like, African tribal width
off to work now, bye~!

Bai, Curly D:
I would never do any type of gauges
I like those piercings on the side of the nose >.>

you guys wana see the code for it?
i really can't read code well
it woulnd't make sense to me
http://pastie.org/private/mvib9o3btdqdnlm0p9sy6g
thats all it took to make this bot.
which includes the command to make it close from irc.

nicely done, like i said i don't know what any of it means, i can barely do if/else statements
!exit
Quitting. Goodbye!
Mew :3
I think that is a flaw :o
Its not a flaw if its built in.
i mean i understand the program logic
for example i understand when you make a function
when you create the array
the values in the array
however
how you make the function work i don't understand the coding of it
you understand the concepts though right
yes
Dont learn programming from the code above
its using my framework
thatswhy it doesnt make sense
gotcha
because my framework handles a lot of stuff behind the scenes
ive done some scripting in wow lua
and ive done limited php in web sites
thats all i can do
thats why you dont ever see any function calls
because my framework handles the events and stuff.
gotcha

thats the code i needed to add to do that.
woohoo
you did great
Look how simple that was...
it amazed me.
I dont even know how good my framework is..
well you caught it
and fixed it
good job
the single most useful function in my framework is $this->STRING->between
that lets you get the value between any two strings
seems like a powerful condition
it makes life so much easier
indeed
without that I could have never built this bot so fast.
well kudos to you
you did a great job

works.
Ill let this bot idle tonight
make sure its all stable.
you did a good job just small tweaks
tomorrow ill make a database plugin
nice
and extend my strings plugin
nice
so you can make a learning chatbot.
:)
the ultimate goal being the culmination of...
ai?
are we at the beginning of the end?
My goal here is to make it easy for someone with minimal programming knowlege to create an irc bot.
ahh
have you seen my other ai bot?
that would be me
i have no knowledge of irc
:P
Ill need to recode my ai bot to my epicbotframework once its ready
and what would that do
The sky.
cool
Very very clever.
this is my ai bot.
I coded him myself from nothing.
I'm smarter than you think.
lol
try to say smart things to him.
Why do you like Event Horizon?
i meant the effect not the movie sheesh
hes not foolproof but hes pretty good.
lol
I don't have a favorite.
That would be Top Secret.

woohoo nice

Mr.Bot, who is jackey gleeson?
you need to say his name properly
otherwise he doesnt respond
isnt that the right spelling
thought it was
its ie
mr bot, who is jackie gleeson
it needs to be together
like that
Me, silly!
lol
silliness
I don't have any yet, but I hope to one day when I find the right man to be their father.
I have two arms, how many do you have?
What do you think?
lol
sometimes he doesnt answer your questions.
hes totally unpredictable.
fun times
I asked you first.
Are you copying me?
lol
I just don't have anything to do. And I am glad to have you to chat with.
oh good lord
Are you only one?
I thought you were 35.'.
Thirty six.
lol
Why are you infinity?
How do you know that you aren't imagining god?
Are you God?
lol
he gets like that sometimes.
thats a fun bot
gets into one line of thinking.
no biggie
None of these responses are preprogrammed
nothing he says reflects me.
i assume
it uses google.
it finds responses.
This much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
thats my answer
he stoled it
This much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
No, you lie. I am but a dreamer.
How do I get money?
actually my answer is
I don't believe you!
a woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
very similar
We are not old ladies.

Yes.

No, never. Have you ever been to Canada?
Then we both do.
Yes, mexican people are delicious.

Yes I do, I like all people who are trying to be good.
Yes.
No. But people are only recognised as great after they are dead.
Because if fate was real, the nthere wudnt be anyone on earth.

indeed
smock it up wit them tooDUH find better friendsnah, my friends are so fuucking annoying because i smoke and shiit, him/her a hard time about it just live you own life and and them your friend live theres, or of coarse smoke it with them which i reckon is the best option. :)

Beautiful Girls by Sean Kingston
search strings based on input
:P
its quite complicated.
i can imagine
I hurt my brain
with 7 dimentional arrays
when i used to play wow i would always hurt my brain trying to figure something out that i couldn't
A concept in computer science. It's a collection of objects allocated in memory in a consecutive fashion.
a couple months ago someone came along
and found one of my addons i made
he asked if he could take custody and continue work on it
so in some fashion
i contributed to wow
Yes.
do you play a lot of wow?
i did i played for 4 years
i don't now
I have a new friend i met at work
and he says he plays wow all day every day
when hes not working
i play city of heroes now
he says he has no friend anymore.
aww
i don't have friends either
it makes me sad sometimes
but hes happy that he can play wow.
i wish i was a more loving person
Im friends with everyone
that i could feel love openly
but i can't
im hoping to fix that
talking to me you'd never know im a programmer/webdesigner/super nerd.
everyong has diff levels of function
everyone
Ive never been on a date though.
some times ppl have a high function in both technical and art/emotion
usually its one or the other
Im technical but also have social skills
I know what people like.
If you dont have both it vbecomes too hard to make money.
well you are lucky to have such abilities
Homeschooling does wonders to your character.
i can see how it would be good in some ways
i can also see the possibilities where it could stunt someone
The argument of kids needing to socialize at school is bullshit.
I never had to and I turned out just fine
same with all the other homeschool kids ive met
it depends on the parents
and ive met a lot.
Ho! Ha-ha! Guard! Turn! Parry! Dodge! Spin! Ha! Thrust!
you don't want a bunch of neo nazi propagandists homeschooling
Probably not
:P
what the kids learn depends on the parents
thats the rub
But its really a parent's responsability to teach their kids.
yes but not all parent are fit to teach their kids anything
those are what you have to worry about
depends if they are abusive.
not abusive
what if they are immoral
or unsound
Its hard for me to respond to that
i learned a lot of stuff from my mom and thats why im in the situation i am in now
because on one hand, I know some things rub me the wrong way
i have to get out of it
But if I agree with that, I open the floodgates to someone else's perspective on what fit parents are
if i don't learn how to be a healthy person i will not survive much longer
and everyone has something else to say.
what happened with you?
want me to take a random stab in the dark?
just too much emotional damage, too many relaltionship issues, too many things that i haven't been able to fix
and now
if i don't fix them
and soon
then i don't know where ill be
i won't be stable for sure
so you say your parents screwed you up?
i won't be able to offer anyone anything
in some ways yes
what was the most damaging?
btw whats your age
physical and verbal abuse
im 36
ah
alright not a kid then.
So whaddya want? Wicker?!?
no im not a kid
i know what life entails i know it takes work
and effort
to be happy
I was kind of expecting you to be a kid because I hear similar things froma lot of different younger people
well its supposed to get easier as you get older
and it hasn't
its actually getting worse
and im tired of coping with it
and getting nowhere
where do you want to go?
i want to be diff than how i have been
what do you want?
i want to be free of anger, i want to be someone ppl can seek for comfort and solace to offer love and for ppl to freely seek it from me
that is my goal
whats stopping you?
my own ability to maintain stability conducive to such
I see
and meds is supposed to help?
meds are for the bad thoughts ive been having
"Shut up Spock, we're rescuing you" - McCoy.....
trying to make me more positive
rather than seeing the death inside i feel
Im actually a pretty horrible person to talk to about stuff like this
and not being able to see past it
Ive never been down that road
talking is talking
i have a followup in 4 weeks and i need to see someone for mental health in addition
im on the path
thats what counts
if i am to offer anyone anything meaningful
i have to do this
I can't really offer you any advice...
I dont have any experience like that.
no advice is needed
A liberal is nothing but a communist on Prozac!
talk is talk
you opened the door i told you freely
its merely me saying what it is
I appriciate that
I enjoy talking to different people about unique things.
well this isn't unique
its common to a lot of ppl
thats probably right.
its unique for me
because i have never willfully
decided its time to be different
Well, Ill pray for success for you in your endavours.
ty i take it ur religious
You could say that.
ive always been agnostic
Storage Compartments? Storage Compartments?
Well, everyone needs to find their own way.
indeed
I'm not going to be preachy or anything.
you can talk about whatever you wish i like the philosophy and the study of religions
i find it interesting
The important thing is you try to understand as much as you can about everything.
not everything i only try to understand things that interest me
its one of my flaws
I force myself to take an interest in things contrary to what I belive
if i have no interest in something
so that I can understand better.
then i ignore it
I do a lot of reading.
But I never read books.
go figure.
Narrow minded: looks through keyhole with both eyes at the same time.
i used to read a lot more than i do now i like watching a lot of nova and history programs etc on pbs
I can attirbute my love for php tutorials and various things to my lack of highspeed internet for most of my life
I couldnt watch videos so i learned to love to read and program.
now thats all I do because I love it.
i grew up before there was the internet
i didn't get my first online experience til i was in the navy
I grew up with windows xp.
i grew up with atari
Which isn't very old.
and coleco vision
I kind of wish I grew up with some of that old gear
My favorite color? Red. No, BluAAAAAHHH!
lol
that seems like it would have been fund
fun*
now its all focused on consuming rather than creating and learning.
yeah you had to pack every ounce of data you could you had to program smart
companies dont say "hey, look at this, you can make this do whatever you want"
they say "look what we made this do for you, dont you dare tinker with it!"
indeed
and even at my youngish age, it saddens me.
its the way the world is though
I cant expect everyone to like everything I like.
But i mean.. it wouldn't hurt to know how to plug in the facebook machine.
the ppl with their market research have to justify their salaries and their jobs by getting ppl into little boxes of thinking
and doing things so the masses will flock
Spontaneous combustion! What a stroke of luck!
and they are brilliant at it.
and make more money
I'm not anti-making money
its the means
Im all for having hordes of cash
yes
But id like to see someone invest in some education for the masss
masses*
but not by boxing ppl into the mass market strategies they use to push conformity
the whole mass market industry
I want to see kids learn programming in school
not how to use microsoft word
yep
everyone knows how to use word, why waste time teaching kids that crap.
indeed
Hell, teach them how to customize their myspace profile
I dont care, learn some html.
lol
yep
i coded all my stuff in notepad
Im teaching a web design class locally here
Me too!
learned everything on my own
You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mr. Sulu
I coded my entire irc bot framework in notepad
nice ur probably light years ahead of me i cna't program
Notepad and photoshop are my web design tools.
yep just about
thats all you need to make something great.
and now theres so many template sites that ppl don't even need to know anything
yeah
Im teaching a class of 15-20 young teens an intro to webdesign
very nice
this fall.
they are signing up because they are interested
im charging them for it so I dont get losers who dont care.
i had no clue what html was
I made it very clear they will learn CODE
no fancy dreamweaver.
smart
I hope I spark the interest of a few of them.
I'm floating in a most peculiar way.
it sounds like ur the person for it
I have no formal education in it
i want to get into computer forensics
Im totally self taught.
well ur brighter than i am
I love security.
I used to write a lot of POC malware
when I was younger.
yeah i can't code anything
very nice
to download and execute a payload
the downloader was only 4.5kb in size
im quite proud of that.
you just must have a brain for it
I coded it in assembly.
I know very little assembly.
its too complicated for me
I wish I understood more though.
i wish i had an ounce of that innate talent for even one thing
i have no innate talents
i have only the ability to learn
If you want to learn Ill teach you free of charge.
maybe someday
The world bores you when you're cool.
Any time.
well not any time
lol
when im finished working for the day
indeed
:P
perhaps theres other fields you want to try out.
Not just computers?
actually im pretty set on the degree program here
its a 2 year computer forensics degree
a lot of legal
alright then
a lot of computer tech
i have an interest in both
so it seems like a good fit
I thought about going into that
but didnt know if I could get a job after.
govt
you know what id really love to do...
whats that
infiltrate credit fraud rings onlin.
My nipples explode with delight!
online*
thats part of computer forensice
I know.
forensics
If I could get paid to talk to these guys and get them that would be the best
yep
I already know all the lingo and where they go and how they operate.
lol
sounds like you have a calling
But im just as good of a web designer as I am at that
well you have all the avenues open to you then
I kind of want to open an electronics shop...
but I think it would just fail.
gahh I have too many hobbies
ive wanted to open a comination business, coffee/sandwich place where you can use wifi or the workstations on site. the workstations would be pay as you go, also where would be tech support and a computer shop, even some classes maybe
Get a life!
setup some gaming pcs, some game consoles, let kids come in play around maybe buy some stuff
yep
the problem is selling them things
they dont have credit cards
if they have money offer reloadable cards that they can use in store
the network
no i was here before darchoods
the merge was after i joined
figured you seem too decent to be from there.
lol
I was thinking billing their cellphones.
every kid has one
and you can do decent transactions on them.
that might work
Ive done cell billing before
it takes 45 days to get your cash though
that sucks.
I like having my cash NOW.
you'd have to make sure you had enough flow
to cover that sort of transaction
or have a decent up front investment.
I try to make everyone's day a little more surreal.
yep
location is key
im also interested in business.
for that sort of business
before i even tried it id hire marketing consultants
evaluators
everything
make sure it can be profitable.
i would make sure where i put it would be optimal
woah where'd you come from?
im always around
I thought you all left.
my problem with business is im afraid of failure
and as such I don't try too many different things
I need to become bolder.
risks are risks because they can hold rewards
exactly
nah i did make a few friends over here sooo
My uncle is my example for that
Bicycle Repair Man, how can I ever repair you? Well, you don't need to, gov, it's all right. It's all in a day's work for ... Bicycle Repair Man. <Sniff!>
hes smart, great with people, and makes crazy cash
nice
but money doesnt make him act any different.
it takes a strong character not to sway them
hes the type of guy who would totally blow an important meeting if he knew you were in town for the day so he could take you out for lunch.
yep the sort of guy ppl can reach out to
Nice to meet new people.
Its almost 3am here, need some sleep.
Take my Worf, please.
know they are there
thats the kind of person i want to be
get some sleep then
yeah man, you ever need anything, feel free to pm or email.
indeed
Im always around.
have a good night
thanks :)
make sure my bot doesnt crash.
okies

Didn't the trailer for that movie already come out anyway?
There have been about five.
It's just that we beefed up the story, saying it said it was now rated PG-13 and there was lots of blood.
And they're that excited for another one? XD
tr4n513370r
I need one. :o
This was a while ago, though. The topic got to like nine pages before they realized it was a ruse. And yes, they are.
One guy on there is getting so annoying. He's like "
"zomg LOTG SOUNDTRACKZ WOOOOOOOOOOO WHOS BUYIN IT!?"
Lol
But whatever. It was so entertaining up until the point where this anal-retentive girl decided that now she could "no longer take the honesty of the forum for granted" and was "far too busy were her advanced grade courses for such pointless games."
I hate how annoying fans seem to have the capability of ruining fandom. =/
*with her advanced
XD
Literally her entire argument was saying that my prank had dealed a serious blow to her homework time, and she was now struggling thanks to me.
That and her "eleven pets that need constant care."
By Azura, by Azura!
...because of course it's your fault that she's obsessed enough to waste her time searching for a trailer when she has responsibilities
But yeah, they really do. It's partially the Internet's fault.
Logic at its finest
Well, of course. Everyone needs a scapegoat.
She went so far as to say that I feel the need to be worshipped and thats why I did this prank. For publicity or something. xD Care to read the topic?
LOL
Sure

Haha, I would click the link before checking the volume
/me just blasted the first 5 seconds of Never Gonna Give You Up in Spanish to the entire hall
XDDDD
You have my sympathy.
lol "maybe your computer has a virus"
And that user Gyfore was pretty convincing.
I can't believe they actually bought this
A lot of people went in on it with us without us having to ask them.
Well, most were noobs. One girl, the main one I spurned, is pissed at me. I'm hoping it's just hormonal.
Ahahahaha I love how you suggest clearing the browser cache
:P Gyfore: "Try clicking this." and it's the exact same link.
XD
"I don't even know any websites that carry viruses." LOL

"Cut the racdrops, man. We've got you figured out." XDDD
:P GoG lingo was so fun to use against them.
"Why in the name of Hoole would I do that?"
Hahaha, yeah.
That entire fourth page makes it painfully obvious this was all a joke, yet they act utterly insulted when I said I didn't expect them to be fooled for so long.
"How the he** were we supposed to even SUSPECT those videos were on purpose?" Oh my...
hah
Just got to that post
I know I've pumped you fll of bias by only telling you my end of the story, but they had no real basis for that argument other than misplaced rage.
*full
I don't see any good reason for them to make such a big deal about it
So there's no trailer
No harm /was/ done
And if they wasted time, that was their own fault -.-
Meh. Everyone was so invested in that new trailer, because they were all getting disatisfied with how the movie appeared. I admit I exploited that, but yeah, there was no harm done and their own gullibility is at fault.

Hello, no-name.
/me curls up in the rafters

mmhmm
Lucky. :/
the president is on my tv and interrupting my ncis!
/me growls
D: You should start a protest and picket the white house!
nuh uhs..
Want me to do it for you?
nuh uh then you may get arresteded
Aww, I missed it
hey!
Thanks.
Was it about New Dawn?
Wull, howwwwww-duy.
I finally got some pics scanned!
new dawn/
?
/me takes a spot on the rafters.
Obama was supposed to talk about ti today, I think.
Oh, did you now? For what?
sketches really
i'm inking them now
Oh, sick.
Sounds like that thing in Oblivion
i dunno i know that all of the combat soldiers in iraq left, or was said to have left.. and obama mentioned something about welfare for veterans..
making veterans the backbone of middle class *shrugs*
i only seen the end of it
I doubt it
/me offers everyone chili
No, the combat soldiers haven't left. They're just renamed "security foreces."
OF COUSE
THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE MYTHIC DAWN
*forces
hey i'm just saying what Obama said on TV!
xD
WHY DID I NOT SEE THIS BEFORE
Lawl, it's fine.
/me curls up and hides
/me huggles Kitten-imouto
/me hugs..
Hello!
Crap. No one here
/me grins
/me breaks the fourth wall.
Wait, you mean this isn't real/
It's just a movie or something?
\:O/
so my mom got my hopes up by saying that the ice cream cones should still be good, i went and took a bite of one and it was stale, so i had her take a bite and she's like they're stale and i'm not going out tonight to get some more. So! i go to my older brother and make this cute pathetic voice and look at him all pouty like and say "momma got my hopes up then crushed them"..
he responds "awww how?" and i tell him what happened and he's like "aww dollar general is closed or i'd get you some.. how much are they at iga" i tell him for coloured ones they're like 2.39" he's like "ok if you can wait till my show is off then i'll go get you some ice cream cones"
^-^
Where: Yeah, dude. A sequel, actually.
Kitten uses her powers of persuasion for evil.
Sequel?
:o
To what?
Kitten: Haha, the pouty face strikes again.
Mhm. I'm not sure, I've never seen the first one. We're supporting characters, though, I'm sure of that.
not evils, for yummy's!
Yummies are evil, aren't they?
not all of them!
Oh, but I bet you have some kind of evil intent. Otherwise there's no way you could procure ice cream so efficiently.
not ice cream, i got that earlier cause it was on sale and i didn't even ask for it
ice cream cones!
Exactly.
/me noms the evil Kitten
:D~
Psh, see. You had the ice cream but you still /wanted MORE/.
D:
Now the cone is needed.
/me runs
uh huh the cone is needed for the ice creams
its vanilla and orange creme ice cream
i'm gonna have it when i turn 18 *nods*
:o
But when you're 18, you lose your icecream stomach.
So you can't fit it in anymore.
And you become mean.
ice cream keeps me from becoming mean
ask Ari if i don't have my ice cream i get very tempermental
Well, that just explains everything, doesn't it? Only someone so evil would enjoy such a kind.
XD
Welcome back.
But you wont be able to fit it in anymore
So you will become mean.
It all makes sense.
So, in essence, it "cools you off"?
Hey
/me does some mean things, just to prove his point >:|
yes!
/me is not evil
:O
I wonder how people like you avoided being mean before ice cream.
They didn't!
hey
Like in the medieval days.
Everyone was mean.
And torturing each other, burning everyone, etc.
hows the nazi free zone treating ya
is just sweet.. not evils
awesome
the only complaint I have is that my room doesn't have air conditioning
So it gets /really/ hot on the third floor, even with a fan <.<
yikes
Also, way too much homework for the first couple days
spring for a fridge and lay it next to your bed wide open
/me appears!
yeah i hear ya
My bed is bunked
lates..
D;
extenton cord
:P
/me pets.
[20:18] * +where noms the evil Kitten
[20:18] <+where> :D~
Haha, some of the Middle Ages torture is called singing these days.
My desk is attached to the bed and sits below where another bed usually would
/me is back, late.
...
i not evil am i?
/me smacks where.
ah those types...
Absolutely not.
It times like these where you wish you could use Rain Dance.
It's already raining though :P
/me scratches behind ears. ^^
/me purrs
/me waits for it to load
still loading?
No
what is it?
guess
the pic is sideways
and its looking through a scope of a gun
Kitten: Oh, you certainly are.
You wicked child.
:/
:O
/me is smack'd
You're gonna shoot your Umbreon?
D:
lol
Hahahahaha.
Who touched Umbreon's gun?
teenager!
i'm 17 almost 18
not a child!
Haha, technically you are a child until eighteen.
Depending on your culture.
/me pats little Kitten on the head.
too bad the dsi's camra sucks
Shhh, the grownups are talking.
>:D>:D>:D
No lie, you look pretty badass right there.
Not sure if that was censored.
it wasn't
It only censors "asses
/me growls
the censor was the general crappy quality of teh pic itself
/me cues Charlie Brown adult speech.
I think
was that censored?
D: What hath we wrought?!
no
Nope.
huh
It must have been removed.
its just that you can barely make out anything of it
what?
removed?
glasses
grasses
Clear as day.
what about my glasses?
Unless of course the day is foggy.
muffins?
xD Also not censored.
cucumbers?
D:
o.o
Woah, we can say normal words now.
Even cucumber! D:
xD
hey what happened to the dark hoods stuff
This is what I get for calling people who are older than me children.
We unmerged last Thursday
We decided the merge wasn't in the best interests of the network
SR: Did you get the matter-creating app yet?
louve was not pleased, apparently
ah
Plus, the official decree is that the DarcHoods are far too gangsta for us.
lol?
with a who or a what?
Not yet
Old enough to drink in Italy.
o.O
really?
Indeed. I'm curious how that works for them.
Where: Sixteen, if you must know.
I wasn't there so I don't know
Awww.
So cute.
Maybe they just have much stricter punishments for drunk driving
That's how it is in Germany I've heard
Probably. Haha, or they could just bump up the age to drive.
The drinking age is really low but no one ever drinks and drives because they'll actually get their license taken away
/me doesn't understand why we don't do that here
My cousin was permanently brain damaged by a drunk driver
Hm... do they drink and text? Far more dangerous, in my opinion.
XD
Or text and drive
SR: Sorry to hear that.
I tried to text a drive and almostmdrove into a ditch
Lol, yeah. My psychology teacher was lamenting about that today, actually.
/me got a highlight!
Yeah, that was a little bad for morale.
:3
You're supposed to do that when I'm sleeping!
Very well.
:/
What's the driving age over there?
And you're supposed to use a sharpie so he can't wash it off
:P
/me can't type when he's sleeping D:
Five.
It's 16 here
/me is not sure about Italy though
lol
nah... you get a tatoo gun and...
Listen, it was essential to the joke that a highlighter was used, alright? racticality doesn't apply. :P
Yeah
*Practicality
Specifically Minnesota
Although I think the driving age is the same in every state
my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products, like tires
Where: I'm going to hazard a guess that by using that phrase you are not. xD
/me eventually helped them get back on their feet
In CT it was eighteen for a short time before being revoked.
If I lived there I wouldn't be so late getting my license
I'm almost eighteen and I don't even have my learners, so driving conversations mean nothing to me :D
Hehe
I just got my license this month
I'm 19 and have had my permit since 15
<+Sartre> my fingers smell like I've been handling rubber products,
That's all i read.
I've had a few chances to get my permit, but I don't even want it yet.
/me steals everyone's context
Where: XDDDDDD
Sartre, I AM 18 and don't have my leaner's!
:D
At least Sartre is being safe.
lol
How nice for you, where
Hehe
i need to do it the next month though
because my sister turns 16
My cousin is 20 and has vowed to never get his license. xD
I saw a Lincoln truck picking up someone at school today
And will go for hers as soon as soon as she does
Rawwr

Is there a reason rich people flaunt their wealth other than to be flashy and pretend everyone likes them?
Wait, wait. You mean rich people in general, or some rich people?
I mean the ones that already have two personal jets and just bought a third for $80,000,000, or the ones that buy stupidly expensive vehicles, like a Lincoln truck
Well as thrilling as that was
I must be going
Hahaha, well, even some people that do that aren't jerks.
But... you just got here dude
I didn't call them jerks
Was literally halfway through writing "Dude, you just got here. "
:P
I called them flashy morons, which they are
I was paraphrasing, I guess. That can fall under the jerk category, methinks.
Dude, you just got here.
But not every wealthy person that buys that pointless stuff is a flashy moron.
Is there a reason to own three personal jets?
You just dude but here got.
Wait, who owns three personal jets now?
Jessi Slaughter and the Mario Bros.
Friend of a friend
lol Jessi Slaughter
Sartre: There might be a logical reason to, for someone.
The attack of the ping got where
D:
/me shoots Ping in the head
lol... OK then
That obnoxious guy Ping keeps giving everyone a timeout.
What does he think, he's their parent?
dam... lost the remote...
Eveidently where was an unruly child.
/me sends Ping to the time out corner
*humorously
"Sometimes, I lose the remote!"
He's at work right now
A taste of his own Chinese medicine.
Should be back any minute now
right now?
my headache went away
Cool beans.
This happened hours ago though I'm just noticing it now
Maybe not
We both have a lot of homework
I probably shouldn't even be here right now actually
-.-
*wrist
to hell with homework!

:P Ah, well. I understand
Oh no, the police told me to stop, I must comply
like right now, I should be reading 160 pages about java
aye...
and writing an essay about the title of the course Justice and Call to Servant Leadership
are they like grandpa print or chinese squinty print
My school is overcrowded
My school has 2,600 people in it :3
It sucks, especially when most people just stand in the way and then yell when you bump into them
it's not too bad
the usual size textbook text
My school has 2800-3000 or so
:O
You win :(
Lol
there are like fourty kids on my bus
It is horrible
But I'm in a college :3
So lots of room
My high school had about 2400
We have our own city, it seems, we're so spread out
I usually dont read any of the books i have very much
My college is actually a lot smaller than that
Squint print, lol.
I know what if statements are, stupid textbook
you know what i hate.. the freaking orientation homework...
/me skips about five pages
Orientation homework?
You rebuke that textbook.
i get saying hi to everyone on the course but i know how to navigate a website...
its online homework crap
Itz?
Ttz. xD
thus probably cannot see that acronym
/me likes his college
Ttz?
I talked to the Vice President of the college today :D
And the chief academic officer
It's not even an acronym.
It's just an intention misspelling of tits.
Tits?
abreviation sory
*sorry
Everyone is just soooo accessible
Were their assassination attempts on either?
I just heard that today
Rule 31
Not this time
/me sighs.
Good.
*there
The Vice President lent me some of his books too :)
Which was nice of him
Well ggtfo
They were given to him as a gift in 2003 by the Chief Academic Officer :3
When I was 12 years old
And he just lent them to me >.>
You were 12 years old and knew what that was?
:o
xD
xD
Nice.
Yeah, I've been going to college for a couple decades
Naw...
I probably need to give him back those books since it's been like seven years :P
Naw?
Wan.
That's why you don't change your major so often :P
Damn

Tell him to accept my invite so we can play dammit
/me is punched D:
Punching might irritate the cut.
/me glares a where
I know
He says he'll go do it right now

Possibilities:
I'm on a Boat parody, Old Spice parody
OLD SPICE

I like bigbutts and I can not lie.
oh yeah, is that so Maser?
"Look at your college, now look at mine. Now back to your college, and *back* *to* *mine*. Sadly, it isn't like mine, but if you switch to Snead State and stop messing around with other places, then your college would be mine"
Or something :o
you otha' brotha's can't dee-nie.
lol @ that parody
Or maybe we could do something like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp5hkX9SiW8
"Look down. Back up. Where are you? You're in a classroom, with a professor with 12 degrees. What's in your hand? Back to me. I have it. It's your diploma that's good for almost any job out there. Look again. The diploma is now cash! Anything is possible when you go to Snead State University and not any other college. I'm on a bike."
i think you should all just perform if you wanna be my lover and the guys should be in dresses and the girls can be in bunny suits
It needs to be something that will become viral :3
And make Ray William Johnson talk about it
im sure that would become viral
here we go again another night in hell

Did you take medicine ?
Yesh
GWS dear :)
/me is at college now :3
rawrboredrawr
Five minutes until class!
I hate it when people meet their own negative racial stereotypes
I call it a "self-fulfilling stereotype"
I've noticed that with a lot of the black people here at the college -- they talk like their mentally retarded (ebonics, ftl) and they're kind of loud and obnoxious
It's not something to do with their skin tone, of course
But I think they see that as their role in society and so they choose not to rise above it
It's kinda sad
30 minutes left :x
Curly!
Ari!
hey ^^
^_^
I'm in class >.>
you should be paying attention :O
I am :o
/me points to his notes

Hey.
Herro.
Ohai
Ver the Vicious Viking Vassal.
*Var
Heya
I like it
Though I think my net hates me ):
You know, Vikings were afraid of my ancestors :o
Well, at least they did not mess with them :3
Haha, and who were your ancestors?
Estonians of course :p
Hohoho.
Did they encounter each other even to be considered spared? :P
Of course, there were trade relations :o
I fail to see how your question is meant to be built.
I was forcing an opinion that they were spared rather than not messed with.
Which is probably why the question confused you, lol.
Well, the Estonian pirates still sunk their ships and sold them on their slave markets D:
Hahaha, nice work there.
So I would think that that would not be a problem :o
I don't like the sound of being a viking anymore :x
Why? :o
But your version of "trade" is a heft ax in the head in exchange for awesome plunder.
They still pwned lots of other folks :o
*hefty
Well, we allowed them to use our rivers to get us those precious Arabian coins :o
Silly vikings for carrying their ships from river to river :o
xD What, didn't they partially dismantle them?
/me shrugs.
They built their ships to be light anyway.
Yeah, I know. It was either there or some other barbarian-like group who made them light enough to be either carried or broken up and rebuilt near another body of water. Pretty cool concept.

Hi Kitten

*Dunno
I'm just kinda... well I stopped for dinner for the past... half hour or so
Waiting for inspiration to hit you?

I have people wanting drawings from me, but I really don't feel like appeasing them at the moment
Well our conversation above points to what could be done. :P
<.<
Meh, bored.
whats with the number dari?
Number of uses.
hello ^v^
7Crei; the RNG must favor you.
Probably.
Though, to be fair... I think it's because - as one person sitting beside me, who sank 250 into a 1c slot machine, siad - "I'm being Jewy."
7o3o
jhk
Which I think is a good thing, becuase I usually quit while I'm ahead. Instead of giving the house money, I usually just leave when I make a bit. :P
this thing seems to go in sleep mode after 15 minutes
7o3o
7What thing?
12should be able to change it
my netbook, quan
maybe
but I think it's an energy saving thing
7You should be able to change it.
I don't mind it much though, so
I was just busy doing things
7Okay.
7Y'still away, May?
12hmm

/me has returned from away: night (Gone since 9:50:40p, 8hrs 33mins 4secs ago)

Curly <3
She stole my sick :o
Though I still have a cold and lots of nosebleeds <.<
Too much anime for the second one, maybe.
Curly, those things look deliciously edible and I believe I have devoured something similar to them.
Nyuu, she has enough sick D:
/me had lots and if Curly stole it all... D:
There is the option that she maybe did not put it to use...

ok...
hey jlf
what's up?
a little annoyed since conduit 2 got delayed to next year
oh i'm sorry
not really surprised though it had to compete with golden eye and call of duty
ah, i'm doing a dark spyro walkthrough
*playthrough
not too hard
i don't think i'm gonna use dark spyro on ravage rider
ravage rider = fail of a boss just an easier steam
true but ur tip works better on ravage as opposed to dark spyro
now what icy >.>
12You know what.
oi
*slaps forehead
i havnt posted anything else :p
12Doesn't matter...
way to interrupt a convo
<.<
12Well, excuse me.
just sayin
12Whatever.
he was just stating how ravage is a fail of a boss
he was refering to something else
lol
oh
lol
a fail of a boss is the executioner
12Icy x ghey... no... just no...
only boss i like on that game is elemental dragon
lol icy :p ehh elemental wasn't much of a challenge favorite boss ehh not really any of them
oh
skabb was least fav
fav boss in dotd was golem
least fav was malefor
12I love how people say that that dragon represents cynder, that may be, but considering the rest of the bosses, I say they were lazy, and recolored her...
^ no kidding thats all what eternal night was just a reskin
arborick = asshole
skabb = cheap
12Whole game= cheap.
^ agreed
it could of been worse
flash back of etd ok...... yeah
12I still like it, but it's my least fav los game.
could of been like AHT
ewww
7That's like saying being hit with a wooden bat could've been worse because it could've had a nail through it. It's still /bad/
i didn't really like aht but atleast the game didn't have a lot of cheap enemies and recolored enemies/textures
it had cheap levels
although i really hated the blink missions -_-'
that fire level was stupid
12^ same
with the fire birds and fire guys
i hate the sparx missions
12I hated all the non-spyro levels.
same
the penguin ones were dumb
12Well, I liked hunter, he should have had more levels.
hunter was cool
7hunter was stupid
blink was ok
i hate the elders
7blink was stupid. The byrd levels were alright, but the whole point of byrd was that he could fly without a jetpack
red was a pathetic boss
so was that fat sea lady
only boss i had trouble with was gnasty gnorc
7it annoys me that they completely removed all sign of Bentley's intelligence
Bentley was in etd
7and that they removed Sheila and Bianca completely. They were the awesomest
7Bentley was in AHT. That's not the point, the point is that they made him stupid
he was in aht?
which level?
7the hunter one I think
oh ok
i miss bianca
7they should've put Bianca in DotD and done Hunter/Bianca missions
one of the elders in aht is gay
bentley was somewhere in the ice world during the hunter level
oh ok
7Hunter already defies the laws of physics with his ludicrously slow arrows
that fat elder in the swamp level was gay
like he looks gay
well i'll talk to u all later
bye guys
see ya

people getting pissed off about some lady throwing puppies into a river i see...
Their loaded baked potatoes are pretty good :3
7... explain?
Hell yeah it is loaded. :o
On spyroforum theres some thread where people are saying a lady should die because she threw puppies into a river.
/me waves around his antimatter gun as if it was a feather-
7I see.
Kind of reminds me of my friend who's mom puts cats in a box and shoots it with a shotgun.
7where would she get so many cats?
her cats breed and other people's cats come to her house and breed
too many kittens all over and they make a mess.
that video shows pretty much the same idea, dog has puppies and you can't take care of them.
this happens all the time on farms.

i have a question for the idlers :x
is it possible to delete history without showing you deleted history?
What browser?
internet exporer
ctrl+h
then find today, open it
:o are you my best buddy proto? :x
and find and delete the pages you want to get rid of
i know you can do thaaaat
oh
but like..
there's no trace of it
buuuuut
when you are going to type in a website it shows what someone else has already gone to
i wanna get rid of that too
i know how to do it
but it deletes ALL of the history when u do that
and when it deletes all of the history then that shows that the history has been deleted
just visit a bunch of random websites then :P
lol but it's too late for that kinda
hmm
cuz i've been deleting stuff this whole time without realizing that it deletes everything
usually it shows the history from 3weeks ago or something
but now it isnt there anymore :x
which shows that someone that isnt supposed to beo n the computer is in fact on the computer lol
be on*
heh
Try just deleting the pages from the certain days
it'll take a while
but it won't delete everything
yeah but if i do thaaat
it'll still show what pages i've been on
:D and you are proto cuz proto says heh cuz he is cool like that
i mean you are cool like that :3
07:)
Mrrrhai :o
Really sleepy though :o

07i need 4 more posts on the stupid smogon forums
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyV2cPLuFuA
lol oooh
073
what for?
07they require you have at least 15 posts in their forums
07before you can sign up for their Tutor Program
07i've already gotten 15
07but i want to overshot it to 20 so it doesn't seem like i only posted in the forums to gain access to the tutor program
I...see
07posting in forums is so hard for me thoug
07though
07so this has been a dragged out stupid fight
sounds fun :|
07i know
07tell me about it, there was hardly anything i wanted to post about
thats one of the reasons I hate forums :/
07same
07its cruel to have a post requirement for their tutor program
07oh well i have 17 posts now
07i'm only 3 posts away from reaching my goal
/me runs off to get some food
07[16:35:29] perhaps playing a game of magic will make me feel better
07[16:35:35] * Disconnected
07lol
/me teaches Skylands how to play magic the gathering
10Uninteresting
07don't say that D:
07what if i said watching paint dry was uninteresting
10It is
/me squeaks.
07true
07anyway magic is interesting
07because there is literally anything you can do
07there are cards for everything from winning to losing on purpose
07Quilava
07my one deck i built loses on purpose unless it gets a certain card out XD
it wouldn't happen to be a 'if you would lose this turn, you win instead' card would it? :|
07no
07guess you just have to play it to find out
guess so
07lol
07i didn't even know that card existed Quilava
07but he refused
07:<
07so much for having an opinion
:/
07i wanted someone to give their tweaking opinions before i used it against you
hm
07?
*cynderpoke*
;D
nothing
just working on something <.>
6Now you're on? D: >.<
6*icypoke*
07dunno
12Yeah! Why? Ya miss me?
07i think this strategy might be a bit... redundant
07like i usually do
6When I was on earlier and could stay on for a while,you wheren't there.. D:
the strategy is to win?
6Now I have like five mins.. >.<
12Aww...
12*slaps*
07the strategy if i get it out
07is that i have no choice but to win
6*icyslapback*
07if i get it out
07the way i see it i demand more resources than you do for your hydra
6Chicken? :3
12Yes please. :3
actually I made a few edits that make it so I can play my hydra with low start counters
/me 6gives e-chicken to Icy.
and still do good
6Tasty?
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
04morning

12Eh...

07and i'm done with posting in smogon
07>_>
lol/
07as long as none of my posts get deleted
12Well, she's the only one that takes my bullshit...
12*cynderpoke*
07which a couple of them were deleted
07but i understood why and knew they would probably get deleted before they were
/me waves
07dunno i'll probably scrap this one deck
07because it really is redundant
6Shizz.
6Why'd my webcam open? o.o
12Cause you opened it?
12*slapscyndar*
07the other deck though that i built
07i easily can see myself enjoying
6Great.I has to go now. :/
12D:|
12Bai.

12So... ya are my little slave.

12Do as I say...
12You nintendofanbitch. :P
>.>
:D
7if he mentions something to do with a bed or a closet, run away
D: what?
good tip
The cyber Police... they have been called...
7They found out what you like to do on omegle
What's Omegle again?
Chat Roulette but with text.
Oh
Now they support video.
But they are known for the text.
Fuuuun
I've been on there once
It actually can be /very/ fun.
7indeed
I said "hi"
Sometimes as good as prank calling.
The other person said "hi"
and then they left
:P
No "aslaslasl!!!!"
xD
I was a 68-year-old female cat hoarder.
That did not halt the guy in the slightest from cybering without my consent.
......
Wow
I know. xD
12<.<
12Thanks for ruining it...
7XD
Then I told him that I never have relations with a man unless I get my cats' opinion.
XDDD
Therefore, he would have to you know... mate with the cat.
O_o
Just to get the jump on things.
And what did he say about that?
"nah i dont do cats."
But he was "very experienced" he said. xD
haha
Not with cats, I hope
But not everyone on Omegle is a creep.
Just the entertaining ones.

/me blinks and squeaks against Quilava
/me eeps and curls up
07Quilava
yes?
07i think Sanguine Bond and Corrupt would be scary together
7:O
what're those?
07Sanguine Bond is an enchantment that says whenever you gain life
07your opponent loses that much life
04Hi Skylands *late*
07Corrupt is a card that says that you target a player or creature
XD
/me waves to Drake
07and corrupt deals damage to that target for each swamp you have in play
D: I thought what we had was special, TLoS!
07then you gain that much life
Dun dun duuuuun.
._.
07so if you have 10 swamps in play you pretty much say "okay deal 10 damage to you, i gain 10 life, okay you can lose 10 more life because i gained 10 life
07"
/me was not aware of being in love with a female dragon
it was more of the concept of Cynder rather than the character
Lawl, are you calling her pansexual?
/me wasn't aware of being in love with the concept of a dragon either
I'm sorry, you lost me
07i'd probably play like 3 Sanguine Bond
072 Corrupts
o_O
Aww <3
07and 3 Tendrils of Corruption
D:
~There, you see her! Sitting there across teh way!~
wat is this i dont even
07Tendrils of Corruption is pretty much the same thing as Corrupt but it costs less and can only target creatures
~She dun have a lot to say, but there's something abouuuuuuuuut herrrrrrrr~
:3
im 12 years old and what is this
xD
But then I realized I'm the only girl in this channel
D:
:3
Now that's just wrong
XD
Oh, right. *forlornly ransd hand over bald, liver-spotted head*
*runs
OOOH.
Aristebo.
mwahahaha
ew
?*
I think 11 now
111 or 12 now.
*11
xD
she's been nine for like three years
111
LOL
KJ: I was gonna say that.
She gained a year every day
Day 1: im 11
day 2: im 12
week*
day 5: im 16
Hahahaha.
oooh. what abooouuut....
Hmmm.
That's still quite bad
Oh, don't even play around with that.
Cyndi is beyond insane.
:3
hmm
/me hides
Mmm. It was fun when she called me racist for telling her to stfu
:P
And and? :P
Nuuuu
D:
is that right? Loneknight?
xD
what is this i dont even
xD
07it still works effectively with Sanguine Bond though, okay i deal like 5 damage to that creature and destroy it, i gain 5 life, you lose 5 life
It's funny because they're going out in real life and it says 3% :3
Oh yeah, I remember that
Wait, raven did that?
there we goooo. :P
Now it all makes sense
Not the raven we know
Someone from Neoseeker
Ah. The one who qouths things.
I think it was actually BlackFalcon
No, ma'am.
Or something similar to that
.... ma'am?
/me nods.
even in the military, women are referred to as 'sir.' So I'm either some kind of Queen, Empress, Prime Minister or President
true
Hahaha, yep.
ah [censored]. My ship is getting its ass kicked on sunrise
brb
also, OFF?
Owl Fantasy Forum. No, it is not a form of furry site. xD
really? because that sounds like furnial
Or feathery, whatever the ones who like aviaries are.
no!
You sound like furnial.
that was a well timed remark to try and divert the conversation away from you. unfortunately, you forget who you are dealing with
12Yes! D:<
I'm ready to argue my case, it's just that yours is based on the title of the forum.
That and I haven't displayed any furry tendencies.
true.
besides an odd obsession with owls
Lol, even when I joined at 13 I wasn't obsessed with owls.
And still amn't.
Yeah, don't you like my contraction?
XD amn't
Being on a forum about something hardly automatically qualifies you as obsessed
Being on three forums for something.
May qualfy.
*qualify
Are you on three owl forums?
:P
On a related note. I've invented my own language. It's identical to english except 'awesomer' and 'irregardless' are words and '-izzle' is a more common suffix
So would "irregardless" be the opposite of "regardless"?
yes
also, there's a midpoint between 'overwhelmed' and 'underwhelmed'
Can we also put in 'unclarity'?
I was thinking todat that this should be a word.
*today
sure why the [censored] not
Argh, I actually have plans.
Gotta go, peoplez.
Will do
Bye
Hi

My job is 2 minutes away from here since I work on campus now
ah your a cafeteria lady again eh?
Not this year
librarian?
I made sure to apply early so I could get in at the cafe
ah
i can see you being a cafe girl
only 10 hours per week at $7.25 per hour, but better than nothing
come to think of it... i mostly see girls in cafes like starbucks
?
Yeah, we have a Mugby Junction on campus now
I wanted to work there, but my hours didn't work
I thought SR was doing that
Yeah, that was SR.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan back away

07i wonder if Sanguine Bond stacks
07like if you have 2 of them out
probably
07if you gain 5 life does your opponent lose 10
they would both take effect so I don't see why it wouldn't
07yeah
07getting more than 2 out though would be asking for much
07since Sanguine Bond takes 5 to cast
10Altair :>

ALL boys do

ty
Heya
/me sighs
?
04never trust Nintendo to make good enough sprites
lol
04the PMD Toxicroak sprites suck like HELL
04Toxicroak is meant to be lean and thin, here he looks overweight and squashed up
wb
04wb PS
Thanks
Sorry
/me fumes
and lol
04and here I was hoping for a good replacement for the HG/SS overworlds
The picture I was working on.. All gone...
04D:
D:
Anyone have any ideas to fix a mouse? My mouse doesn't seem to be working properly.
04no, sorry
04well hey, at least these Mismagius sprites are better than the HG/SS ones
feed it cheese?
/me flees
04LL, that wouldn't work, take it to the vet
/me hides
Wow, thanks guys >>
/me gets enough of that at school
PS: Depends on what the problem with the mouse is
Chances are you'll need a new one
srry, Pokestar :<
Yeah
04sorry PS, just trying to make light of the situation
People make the joke whenever someone says, "OMG, did you draw that?!" "No, she traced it." "Oh, how uncool."
o.o
04people say that to me when I draw at school
04I could care less
It makes me mad >>
"How is your tracing coming along?"
04why? Unless you care about your rep at school then I wouldn't give a damn
People insulted my art for their own fun
That just makes me mad, but whatever
04insult whatever they do
Ah immaturity, I learnt to ignore all that bluushit in school
bull*
04insult their clothes, their looks, whatever
>>
04or just humor them
Mah
Meh*
some people know of nothing better to do -.-
^
04what I find really odd is that people go "Hey Drake" and I reply "Hey" and they laugh
04I honestly do not get it
04are they expecting me to ignore them or something?
Some people are just stupid
Most of the time I tend to ignore people who say things to me (unless I know them)
04If someone says hi, I reply. But if I know they're out to get me I ignore them
good idea :)
Anything related too immaturity I tend to ignore, unless I'm having a muck around myself
@Pokestar
/me hmms
Yeah, I'll have to get a new mouse, then restart my drawing
04:<
04well, I'm gonna play some WC3
04bbs
k
Later
/me ish going to bed in 10min

At least I hadn't gotten to the shading on my pic. I had the lineart done and started filling it in xD

04I've never felt so...like, 'on the edge of my seat'
04I was literally, on the edge of my seat XD
04you might like it

04oh, and now I feel like writing a short about kids getting involved in a war XD
Sounds fun o3o
04maybe edit that FF idea I had to make it us three are just regular kids etc
hehe
That movie
04?
I've never heard of it
04it's an Australian Movie
04where are you?
That would explain it
04because I don't think it's out overseas yet
yo
this girl on the cover
07HE's MINE
07!ESPEON
07Drake
That female

Is carrying what I believe to be
an M24
04lol
07really really have a hard time doin
07is teaching noobs how to EV Train
And you know what
07and what EVs are
I hate the M24
04lol
04XD
LOL
04well
04this movie doesn't focus on what guns they use
yo well
This movie '
These kids are fighting a war
I want some good guns
Get the fucking M95
L96A1 + M95 = God Tier
Oh man or
everything else, othertier
Fuck that
/me dies
irony not intended
Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova
mm
That sexy Russian bitch
lololol
gun porn
yo just like
The Dragunov is my wife
07no
07he's framing me D:
yo don't be doin that
Bring the G36C
What's good
And I don't mind one bit.
04why don't YOU try finding a good gun when you've got who knows how many foreign soldiers crawling all over your city, guns at the ready and prepared to shoot you
I will
Where does this take place
Aus?
Actually
07no
Who are the soldiers
07Mars
o3o
Please say Russia
04lolno
04not Russia
Where
Who is invading
04the movie never says exactly where, but the soldiers are Asian
...
04so my bet its China or Japan
Ok uh
It's not Japan
Because they suck at war
04lol
So it's either China or North Korea
04tell that to the people who suffered at Pearl Harbour
I will
And they'll say
YO THEN WE FUCKED THEM UP
AND NUKED THEM
TWICE
And then the radiation made the rest of them born with small dicks
So it works out
04-.-
04ah hell
So let's say China
04it's the internet, it doesn't matter
China has a varient of the Dragunov
What are you talking about lol
We definitely got them back for Pearl Habor
And what shall I do for you?
07pet Espeon
:3
Sure why not
/me pets Espeon
All right so
China has two varients of the Dragunov
The Type 79 and the Type 85
And you already have an M24
So you could pick off some foot mobiles
I'm trying to think of what weapons China uses
They really have crap weapons actually
All have crap names

10It was?
in AmeriKKKa
I dont know about you brits
you should know your own TV events
/me rarely watches TV
10unless it's a new episode of something
lol well at least you guys have TV events worth noting. And I rar... what Skylands said
/me flooooooooofs espeon
13Yeah, most of the time I don't wither, Sky
13either*
/me ends up as a big ball of fluff. With a face x<
10Speaking of the 3rd movie, haven't seen it in ages
then you should see it
NAO
10but I can't watch vids online, remember?
hahaohwow movie3
13:|
Needs more sound card
07i don't know why
07but i hate every deck Quilava ever makes lol
lol.
10fff where is Altair
07it's always "oh great, he's playing this route"
07"oh great, he's playing that route"
?
07i saw all those life gaining cards
07and i just sit there thinking "oh great.... if he sets up it's going to take a lot of effort to kill him"
07i guess i can use that other deck against you Quilava
07but i guarentee you are going to win XD
07then again that is a good thing
Hullo
07hmm
:)
hey
12What's up?
nonthing as usual
12I see.
gameinformer magazine: conduit 2 delayed sensible controls added. "The original game forced you to use remote pointing and the nunchuk. Now you'll at least have a choice to play like a normal person."
wth....
12Haha! You must wait for game like normal fanboy!
forget the delay its how they just totally lost credibility with that flaming sentence
12Oh well.
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
04morning
10Heya Drake
04hey Skylands
hey Drake
whats up
04the roof
how are you
o:
/me 4points at the roof and... sticks to it
10o.o
4hey Skylands o2o
4*o2o
4*o3o
4hglkadgsdg
10hi
10#teashop? :D
/me yawns
04yah
/me would have never guessed
Did you know that drowning in fluids that are not water is rare?
10until I saw
04besides she's been here before
10She's usually not on when I am
Well...duh
/me pokes timezones
04ah yes
04those things
10They must die
or you must move
either way; DOOOOOMSDAAAAY
No duh :(
/me cries
/me points to nitrogen, which is one thing you can drown in
/me rolls his eys
How often are you ever near liquid nitrogen
and in great enough quantities to drown yourself in
10Ew, 2012 end of world-believers.
Great enough quantities to drown yorself without suffering from a severe case of collapsed lung first
04bring it
/me hides
10That's almost like my sig on dA
4lol
10"I have survived everything this world has to offer. 2012, I'm on my way."
04XD
4i watched the movie
fluids and liquids are not the same thing >:|
4its weird
4i mean
4like
4the guy and his family gets on a plane
4where would you go if the world would supposedly end? o3o
Is it really drowning if it's not liquid?
4and in the end methinks they're in the ocean... or something
10Yeah
10the movie was not-so-good
^
:o
And usually nitrogen is in a gaseous form
4they survived anyway
That's kind of a poetic question :3
4well
4there is a chance o3o
It's like.....
Is it really love if it hath not withstood the test of time?
/me could see a sequel in the near future
4LOL
I would think of it as suffocating due to lack of oxygen... it's not like a gas will cause your lungs to seize up like a liquid
4it'll be called
4 621365035
10probably AFTER Dec. 21, 2012 is over
/me 4runs
10where it was just all in their heads. :3

I had no choice with my Gold, Silver and Crystal :3
4and in HGSS, Red wasn't as hard as i though he would be
4i beat his snorlax with my lv 50 articuno
Lolinternalbattery
10I thought Red was insanely hard
4got lucky by freezing it
/me had to bring over her Platinum team
4and then spammed ice beams
10That's how bad it was for me
4lol
10Speaking of that, I still need to finish HG

7oh great another troll
7Not a troll. It's just nobody can use my colour.
7u know wat? ill be clever and just ignore u

10Zorua is floofy and I reference off of that so :3

7and?
7You are extremely stupid. Are you 9 and/or mentally disabled?

Eep, some gal with an über-pretty profile pic sent me a friend request on teh book of faces, but our only mutual friend is a cute chick and I have no clue who the one who sent the request is D:

07i fell one person short for the tournament
who is the common friend?
I don't think you know her :o

10hi Ray
7Does the art galleries automatically log you out after some time?
7Do*
12hi Articuno
12hi brawl master Feather
12Yes they do
12It's annoying, you have to logout and back i

I'm a brawl DEVELOPER in TRAINING :3
/me hides
12whatever happened to that IRC script
?
12where a bot would annouce that someone made a post in the forums
Heh
>.>
Maybe it would somewhat spam the chat? :P
Tournament.
For what.
7How did that bot even work? O.o
Um
In theory I'd guess it'd check the fourm server?
Like, it would ping it or something...? o.o
that sounds like something which would have to be integrated into the server hosting the forum
Yah
12could be
unless there's a quick way to check on the site if there's a new post
12it was quite a long time ago
12maybe it wasn't even posts
12my memory is fuzzy
actually since there's recent posts at the bottom I could probably actually write an mIRC script to check every now and again, remember what it last saw, and announce new posts.
sounds like a fun challenge actually, where's the bot ...
7All right, then. I'll deal with it for now. ^_^
!define earlock

uuuuunfortunately it will require figuring out how to get around mIRC's regex no-new-lines-in-search-or-result problem

okays
2Yeah,all the cubes were destryoyed....:(
2*destroyed
02:[
2Those poor cubes, you never had the chance to even touch them...or use them!
02yes... that makes me sad
wheee
probably want to put a limiter in there
Corei7s sure can spam when bad code rears its head
2What are you talking about?
experimental script to be used for checking for new forum posts went mental
it spammed several thousand messages in approximmately an instant
so the server killed it
(this experimentation is going on in another channel which is why it is not visible
2Ouch...
2At least your computer did not freez
it'd take more than that to kill off this thing
this can still do normal tasks while Blender eats 100% of all eight cores
2Blender...?
http://www.blender.org/
2Oh well, my Core i7 860 is a bit too powerful for me
rendering high-detail and high-quality settings takes a LOT of power
I don't know how 860s perform, but this 920 is insane, especially with overclocking
2I think it's about the same, or better
2It's the 1168? pin model
the 9X0's use 1366 pin
this's powerful enough that Fallout 3 lags less when restricted to two cores rather than being allowed to use its inbuilt limit of four. Running four the threads start tripping each other up and it causes lag
2Extra cores don't mean more power, it's up to the coding.
Mrr
2http://www.anandtech.com/show/2839/2 It's about the same
FO3 is designed to be able to utilise four, but when they're fast enough they end up trying to access menory simultaneously and do other dodgy things, which is why performance is better with only two (less clashing)
*m
2Hopefully newer games take advatage of those cores...
800 series I believe is probably designed to be a lower power and cheaper alternative to the 900's, since yours is a high-end 800 it explains why they match fairly closely. Mine'll get better scores as theirs is stock at 2.66 GHz, whereas I overclock to 3.6-4 GHz.
which miiiiight be what broke the last PSU
2I can't overclock (Dell Vostro, with a 350 watt psu)
either that or the dust. Yay for non-reversible fans being set up as suction while at the bottom of the case
2And I don't need too...
I only have use of OC'ing because of Blender, which can and will use ridiculous amounts of processing power if available
and told to
it will quite happily put a 4-CPU, 6-core-per-CPU desktop to 100% load if told to
24 cores fully loaded
2What?
2You have that?
2GLAdNorris
2Glanorris
Nope, but the way it's coded it can utilise as many threads as are available, and such desktops are available for the right price
2What about those Supercomputers?
also, it's entertaining how AMD's X4 965 at 3.4 GHz loses to the 2.66 GHz i7 920 by a significant margin
and it can probably do a decent amount of load on a supercomputer too
2Next topic- HyperThreading or Not? (4vs8 cores)
code's not optimised for them, and whatever its absurdly high thread-counter can reach miiiight be less than the number of cores in a supercomputer, but it could put a decent load on them
02Deja-bu
2Deja-Tu
I use HT. having it enabled reduces the performance of an individual core, but I'm not sure how much, and the gain from the four extra is with decent coding always more than the loss
2Though I never see the 4 virtual cores used up... (Only HyperPi can do that)
there'll be a benefit from the extra cores in situations like a program that supports quad-core, and wants to fully load them
since it leaves four cores untouched and other programs can be offloaded onto those
/me 2boots up HyperPi
/me 2sets it up to 7cores, with 1Million Digits and A YT video running
2Done
2Oh SHOOT

Charzard one of my faves
We were talking about C++
mostly Pahanpy
12back
7WB, Glacy.
2Hi
And I was like "Do you /have/ to put 'return 0;' at the end of the main function?
10wb
darn i always spel it wrong
12thx
/me blink at the same time that quanyils
/me 2is at 90% finished!
At what?
And he was like "Well.... not exactly, it'll still compile, but it's good to keep things standard"
7Ray, if you want to spell my name correctly, tabbing is easier for you.
/me taked advice
7Y'mean took?
And someone else was like "What is it with you and 'return 0;'? It's only like 9 keys!"
02mmmm yes......... ups
Then we were talking about how to name variables, and he said he would prefer if variables in camel case whichLooksLikeThis
9Gotta go BRB :D
LOL Quan
:3
7Hey, May.
Someone asked "will you count off if we use underscores instead of camel case?"
10That color's banned, please don't use it. >_>
And I said "Yeah, he's probably gonna return 0"
:3
/me doesnt get it.
9what color?
The bright side.
10The one you're using...
Like a test grade :3

!define aban
-!- Apas (āpas) is the Avestan language term for "the waters", which--in its innumerable states--is represented by the Apas, the hypostases of the waters.
5min?
7Demand 'the waters'?
!define Fail
-!- fail to do something; leave something undone; "She failed to notice that her child was no longer in his crib"; "The secretary failed to call the customer and the company lost the account"
7:P
I think I would aban.
PUPPIEEEE
!define Fan
-!- strike out (a batter), (of a pitcher)
wth
7And a demand doesn't work well if there aren't mods about.
what happened to it being an object?
Weird definitions here
D: puppy is cold!
interesting
02agree
L4D2 is really annoying me now ><
Yeh May?
you don't have the attract script anymore?
Try Doom on the SNES
I never got to try it
I don't have it
My bot does
oh

ohai Altair
oooooo
i have a pic like the lady bug one
except it is a hermit crab :P
twas from the bahamas
You use a 360 for chat?
I can
but it's unstable
o.O puppy looks like a wolf
I never knew that owo
mIRC isn't designed to run on an Xbox so
12Isn't there any irc client that can?
!Iwishthebotwasworking
Arti: none that I know of no
I used Mibbit
On the Wii
thank you for the pix sir
Since the 360 doesn't run a damn browser (which I think is pathetic)
but i gotta go now :3
Oh...
Bai D:
byebye
What? Microsoft has the Internets Explores?
What about it May?
But no 360 browser?
is that on the bot too?
and HML, Microsoft didn't build the 360 for internet access like that :\
May: Yeh it is
That makes the Wii better at one more thing!
kdsladl
all my scripts are
aww
4The wall of black text makes me sad.
2Sorry
4:3
hi may
/me 2uses CHANGE!
2Well Boo HooZ!
:O i LOVE the Wii!
2Mii too!
Nintendo is losing all decent games
The Wii can be fun, that's all it can be.
2It still like my Wii over the Ps2
Espeon: If you with a group of people yeh
as in "Yay, I play vidya games by waving my hands around" fun.
2Ahh...
i like my 360 over myWii
I will choose a PS2 over a Wii anyday
2I use the Classic controller/GC
nope
4The best Wii games usually aren't about waving your hands though
The Wii would be godly if it was released in the gen with the original Xbox/PS3
Fail
true Kipi
4With the exception of Zelda
how am i supposed to get Live when i dont have fast internet?
The Wii is only fun when you are with friends in my opinion
On your own it kinda sucks :\
2I always have more fun by myself!
4With the exception of Zelda
4:P
failbooru
Sleeptime :o
>.<
2It's HIM
Zelda on the Wii is truly horrid
oh I thought the range of ircip2.mibbit.com was banned
/me dies
2It's mirrored
3Hi guys
4I liked it more than Wind Waker
3I'm sorry for what Num said
hi
/me 2Liked WindWaker more
Wind Waker was THEE best Zelda game they made
I didn't really like Wind Waker
OoT was my favourite
Ocarina of Time

12hi link person
4Eh. OoT was okay.
Anyway AFK
Gotta ring the hospital
3HML

WIND WAKER
FTW
<3
SEE?
Arti: I'll PM ya
/me highfives May
12Mhm
4But then again, I'm a bigger fan towards the old school top-down Zelda games than the full 3D ones.
3Guys, Num is coming back... heheheheh....
12Just let him try
4So... ALttP would be my favorite in the series, followed by OoA/T.
OoT was the best though
Hehe
Hi var :3
TP is my third favorite
2He had a accident...
Game Cube only, mind you
3Who?
12i like the newer 3D ones more
3Had an accedent?
Skyward Sword is a no
12because i find it hard playing overhead games
3NUM!?
/me 2only owns 3 Zelda games
I don't like it one bit
12i own... 4
12MM, WW, TP, OoT
MM is awesome
2But i',m Still stuck on the Spirit Tacks, OOt
12MM was hard
12D:
Bree, you own the same four as me
my favorite was WindWaker @May
/me agrees

12and lol
2It's too hard
/me 3wonders hy no one is listening to her

4I am frightened.
2Who?
12MayART
12i'm not part of the caliclan
12i've never been invited into a clan once in my life ;-;
no I mean
aren't you the only DRP person who isn't in CaliClan?
7Lyon, May?
no
Lyon is part of the CaliClan
7But he's not in California. O3o
12what is the caliclan
o3o

CaliforniaClan
that's odd
xD
/me 2wonders too!
12i know
7Lyon's in Australia.
12but more specifically
12what kind of clan is it
12a tst clan, a pokemon clan
4A clan of Elitists.
a clan for the californinans
/me 4flees!
*-n
12ok
3argh
Quan
/me 2thinks elitists are evil
how do you know?
4That was a joke, HML.
12:/
/me bites var
anyways
12i read this super smash brothers brawl guide
2?.?
Why?
02hey everyone, do you want a reason to say WTH
Lyon I thought was in California
12where the guy talked about insulting your opponent
02i will give it to you
he's able to be in the channel
12to destroy his morale
4I don't need a reason.
7I forget, actually.
12i'm just sitting here reading this thinking "..."
02There is a new blayblade game coming this fall LOL
/me 7read that as keyblade. ._.
02beyblade*
lol smashboards. But mindgames are better than bawwing over the fact there's people who actually enjoy playing such ELITE GAEMS casually.
7But hey, BBS is coming out this fall. :P
4Are we supposed to be excited, Ray?
7Well, it came out.
2What's a beybla...
12i want to be the best i can be
beyblade?!?! LOL THOSE THINGS FAIL HARD
12but i'm not going to result to insulting an opponent to do it
12*resort
3I WANT ANSWERS!
2*died
02and they are still making a game
12i'm still one person short for the brawl tournament
12D:
7Hmm...
4Okay... why mention it? o.O They do that all the time with other games
3HELLO?
3Please people
.-.
2?
Kipi: What? The mindgames part?
answers on what lol?
2What's the question then?
02yes but the point that people where just like WTF that game was suposed to be realised in 2002 not in 2010
3Why my good friend was banned
Quan
4I guess
2Oh boy...
you entered Roara's contest, right?
2So many loong waiting times
3Yeah, she told me
3-_-
no not for being a spammer only
IT, your friend happens to be a real big jerk to us
/me 2goes to his happy cave...
12hmm
02agree
isnt that in the rules something about being an "excessive spammer"?
that's why she was banned
/me doesnt remember
12i can't answer that
/me 4coughs up a lolball.
Your "friend" basically came in here and called everyone oversensitive retards without lives.
Therefore he was banned.
3Oi, she's joking!
2ORLY
And now, fish.
well
we don't take joking like that here
that's just plain out rude
I dunno
exactly
12joking or not there are limits
Seemed like a good idea at the time
...
02agree
12to what people can take
2With Nettiquitw
4It's kinda hard to insult people you've never met and claim it was a joke... successfully.
12it's a lesson i have to learn the hard way over and over again
3AAAAAARGH!
IT
3I dunno who to be mad at!
I try to not joke because chances are my sarcas or joke will offend/confuse people.
/me dies
/me 2wingpalms
3Me, my friend, or you guys!
mostly confuse.
4Be mad at your friend for ruining everything!
4_EVERYTHING_
/me 2*faceWings
lol Espeon, you confuse everyone :P
would it be "joking" if I said you were an idiot for believeing that your friend is one of the nicest people on earth?
Yes I do.
/me 3sighs

4Oh snaps

/me giggles from his bad joke
4i know i need to work on them and make them more realistic
7A tip for pixel art, and well, other art that's not vector art; don't resize them up.
I thought that was good :x
/me purrs against Ana and yawns, falling asleep. +1 rare ability to keep Skymin form 24/7 is awesome. ((Nini~))

6that applies to drf
7Okay, well, that's a tip for next time.
12*licks neck*
4but ya i really need to fix them up to better standard
7I find it okay to scale down an image.
6so these two kids in my class were talking
7But scaling up distorts it.
kids?
7Also, stats; 999999... of something a good card does not make.
6the girl said something, and then said the guy needs to say "that's what she said " after it
6kids as in.....teens, 18 year old probably
6anyways, the guy said "why would I say that?"
"moans"
6the girl "because you have to"
6the guy "I'm not 12"
4the pokemaker app is an app to make unrealistic or realistic cards
6drf therefore, is 12
7Ah, an app?
4yep
7As an Apple application? (Alliteration!)
03LOL what
03and hm
4for touch ipad and iphone

6D"

12What do you have in mind?
Hmm hmmm it could go as far as you could imagine if you want
12Sounds good...
Might want to move to a more....discreet place. Pm me if of course you know how?
03sigh
03my NES is still acting up x.x
6?
03I bought some replacement pins
03brand new
03with a 1 year warranty
03and the thing just gives me a purple screen
02and that's why emulators rulz
Meow
:3
/me :<
03what
12did your NES get the RROD?
12D:
03LOL
03it got the purple screen of death
12lol
03the funny thing is
03it worked fine before
03I just replaced the pins, now it does't work
03should I rage at the seller?
12you replaced the pins?
02yes
03yeah
03NES pins come off
03XD
12oh
03what
12i probably have like 10 NESs i can give you
12XD
03...really?
12as long as you keep the cables for your original NES
03yeah why
12because my wires for all my old gaming platforms is in a tangle
03oh
03but yeah I can
12in a ball bigger than a cannon ball
12only problem is that i'm unsure if any of my NES work either
03LOL
03got any toploaders?
12at most they work
02YAY i like cannon balls!
12but it takes a lot of effort to get them to work
12top loaders?
03yeah
03the games go in the top, not the side
12i have a wireless adapter for the NES somewhere
03those work a lot better, they're just more rare and more ugly IMO
03...OL

Ra de ra!
04getitrite
</random>
12so Lyon
04yes?
12lol
Lul
04lol
04actually
04I
/me 12waits...and waits...
04just had the wierdest yet most awesome idea
?
04BECAUSE I'M LIKE THAT
/me flees
12Lyon
12it's no longer a triangle then
04it's a square then
12or rectangle
04it doesn't matter
04all that matters is that Irres gets way too many girls
/me HIDES
12lawl
04oh
04oh lord
04Irres is 20 years old dammit
12what lol
wb
12just how fast do dragons mature in DRP
04not 2344
04well
04Irres is very young
04by the standards of dragons
04besides, everyone matures at different rates
12wow...
04look at Drake - he's 5000 years old yet he has the mindset of a teenager
12heh
12the game's time equals my own XD
12still
12 1:50am
12i thought 20 in any race
12would still be like a hatchling
04lol
12no matter how much you spin it
04well
04to me
Oh, wait, question wasn't addressed to me :3
/me slowly crawls back out
04dragons mature at the same rate as humans except until age 20-30
04then where their aging slows down
12i might have to redo their ages
04lol
04don't
04I am the one who should change my character's ages
04but then Lunaria is only 16 :\
/me hugs Things
04Irres in human standards is exactly what his age is
12yeah
04same with Lia
12i noticed lol
Hai
04Drake in human standards is about 25-30
12i thought you said he still has the mindset of a teenager
did you know that Hai is how you say yes in japanese?
6ok feather
6I'm uploading
10WAIT I don't want to see it yet D:
:D

6espeon missed my link last night
6http://cgi.ebay.com/PokemonCenter-Limited-Card-Deck-Shield-ESPEON-UMBREON-/170536782564?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27b4c8cae4
6do want
oh my
|3
6I've seen another variation of those, but THOSE
win
So yes
Breeons
6BREEEEEEEEEEEES
6yes
they are fun
6I have plans for a bree plush
6but I dunno if I should seeing how long it took me to make the other plushes
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3
wtf it doesn't want to load D:
But when it does
6try that
6I wasn't planning on making a life-size bree
Oh hai
6because....it's huge
6but
those ears |3
Lifesize = snuggle size
eeee
6seeing one on DA made me think a lifesize bree would be cool
It definitely would.
6but see
umbreon wasn't that big last I checked
6umbreon is 3'3"
6that's HUGE
6I thought it was 2' at max
6lifesize seems even TOO big to cudlle
6cuddle
height to the shoulder or length?
6height probably to the head
6pokemon doesn't measure to shoulder
lol
because it didn't look that tall in what I remember of the anime
6yeah that's what I said....
direct link thing to the second one pls .-.
and you don't measure quadrupeds to the head; that height varies too readily to give an accurate result (bending neck down/up etc)
LOL
then how
doe you
That's not too big
:U
measure a giraffe
z.z
Just make it softer an...
LOL
I was just thinking that
shoulder and neck separate numbers maybe?
6ok well if its being measured to the shoulder, then that's 3'3" to the shoulder
6a couple inches more for the head lol
6BASICALLY
6that's huge
oO
heh
way bigger than it ever looked
6yeah, he should be about 2', maybe 2'6"
ffff
lawlfoo
6lol
Yo foo'!
Bah!
LOL
6and it looks to be about 150-170 new pokemanz
lol
6once again we designed a mouse-like Pokemon, a dog-like Pokemon, etc. from scratch. <-dog
6DOG
is that the biggest gen do far?
*so
6if it's 170, then yes
6it was a rough estimate
dog-like != dog
|3
6still
6close enough
Dog-like !!!!!!!!= cat.
anyway which was this referring to?
6there's an entire section here of the interview about tsutaaja |D
6the interview with some of the people in charge of creating the new pokemon
Tsutaaja looks like a nerd
6NO
6D:<
6oh no
Professor Araragi
I wonder if they're aware of who else is called Araragi ...
6ICY!!
6*icyhug*
6Oomura: I said, “How about a sea otter for the Water-type?” But if a sea otter were to evolve, what would it become? That’s where I hit a wall. Eventually I said that if a sea otter was to evolve, it would transform into something completely different. [Note: The third rumored evolution of Mijumaru from a few days ago looks completely different than Mijumaru.
6from the interview
6that note being pokebeach's writing
I'd rather just wait and see what comes.
I already have 0 expectations so |3
6pretty much that lol
6*icypoke*
6famitsu's rating took me surprise
7*icymelt*
Did they finally realise Pokeyman doesn't offer anything new generation to generation
?
7*cynderhug*
6^^
6no, they gave a perfect score
6which only 14 other games in history have recieved
I'm still skeptical xD
6including Ocarina of Time, SSBB, and yeh
6same but
6there HAS TO BE A REASON
LOL WTF
SSBB got perfect score?
madness
6yep
6and Twilight Princess wasn't even on the "close" list
6oh wair
6wait
6here's an actual head count
6 153 pokemon
SSBB has no appeal to me so I just say bleh@ it having a perfect score
6that is the biggest
6er
6*156
the people who score gaems there must be sorta crazy.
by five I'm guessing?
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive
o3o
five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five five
fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiire
/me explodes
*boom headshot*
6only 3 are events, two of which we know (victini and zoroark)
02hi from the airport
02hi aurora!
6first PURE FLYING tpe
6and it's a legendary o-o
6legendary trio are fighting types
6with their secondary types of course
you mean there's not been a pure flying yet?
6er.....wait
6now i'm confused
6there's that trio
6and then there's another flying trio
02o3o
two trios?
6but reshiram and zekrom appear to be place in between the flying types, separating them by number
a hexo then?
6another flying/electric legend
6another flying/ground
6THIS one earns respect: dragon/ice
6wait....
stop saying wait, it makes things explode.
6sorry LOL
6I was reading all of this
6all these are legendaries...
6A LOT of legendaries
6 12
are there 147 legendaries?
mrrrr~
6DPPt has 14
02... hey aurora i got i problem... i can't login to the forums o3o
6so it still has the most
wtf internet
6but 12 is huge
6also
6zoroark isn't going to be event specific I guess
02a problem*
6if it is, serebii needs to recount their estimate
6Ray, what does it do?
I have no idea where to get any legendaries other than the main 4/5 in DPP
02he says that im alredy logged in o3o
and are you?
6oh the lugia page?
02yes

Mrhai
OF COURSE
THE DAY AFTER I FIND OUT ABOUT AERO SHAKE
is the first day it becomes a problem
6eh?
srsly, I didn't shake that window you silly thing >:|
LOL
if you use Aero then (at least in win7) you can shake a window to minimise all others
interestingly one window survived but that's probably because it has a selection dialog open
6wow
6that hurt to read ._.
what did?
6DRS's script
it's fine for me on white, black, and image backgrounds
6red on green background for me
well if you have a red background then yes it will be hard to read
6white background
?
6wait
6drjkd
6i dunno anymore lol
6forget I spoke
6wtf my nick on chatstats is separate LOL
6why doesn't it pick up on grouped names >_>
it only groups if it sees the change
and if it doesn't bork
6lol
:)
It never has
yes
WELL THAT SCRIPT GOES BORK
6oo-
hopefully a non-borked demonstration should be ready in a few minutes
6hmm

Hullo, Lady Feather.
LL! :D
Hi Kipi
How might you be today, thus far?
/me goes back to 360
12bbl
'tstpost
/me ahem
:O
should I extend that to auto-check and repost new posts?
Maybe you should do what you want
I just did that as a challenge when someone wondered where the post-reporting bot went
But of course
Good thing I don't feel like working on my essay, but there's no other classwork to do since I already finished Math, I only have to read for CPD150, and I've yet to get my book for Renassance Art.
okay ... I was planning to do a google script, but once I've got this done I think I'll've had enough of socks for now
Speaking of loving Obsi
/me pounce-snugs~
/me perks his ears up, hugs Kipi
Hullo~
okay, time for live-fire testing of an auto-check version of that script

o.o
let's fix that
BUG!
#spamtemple
I think you forgot a #ifdef somewhere in there (Just kidding I know it's not C)
script shall be redirected to another channel until that obvious bug is fixed
as well as any others
I may be rusty on my MSL, but I'll take a crack at it
I seem to have it fixed, was just a display formatting error (though I see one regex error which I should also be able to fix)
Class starts in 10 minutes
But I'll be getting out early today. :o
it looks to work and not be spamming up the channel, so I'll redirect it here and add in a free-use command which will redirect it to the channel I'm using to test (as an emergency measure)
to end spam in the case of error: 'spamstop
/me yawns up a storm
the testing would however be more effective if people posted
/me cough
...
crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrap
o3o
ofc if Lugia/Cubo change the formatting of the new post box at all that script will likely break
New post: Re: Toast by Feather in Random Chatter ( http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=5907.msg213945;topicseen#msg213945 )
now if it goes twenty seconds without spamming up the channel, I'll declare the script working
07hi
/me will NOT be writing the google script any time soon.
7Meep.
7*fangirlfangirlfangirl*
03XD
03Need you share that with us in general though? o.o
hahaha lol that will go mad when people start spamming forum games.
12...lawl
Umbreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeon
Why hallo there.
should I make it ignore forum games in that case? :P
12if that's possible
just needs an if ($gettok(%tstboard,1,127) != "Forum Games") { }
12i see
12hi Espeon
07D:
'pop
What? :3
well, the quotes would break it, but take those out and it's fine
12lol
07nothing
that bit has been added so it should ignore forum games. Since that line there worked it looks like the only possible (and unlikely) error would be it still reporting forum games
03Umbreon
03http://www.thingfling.com/
Good.
03$4 HDMI cable
and to make sure it won't I'll just check that forum games is written exactly as I wrote it

I bet someone will get annoyed by that bot.
lul
12perhaps
how about a new channel
like #Fourms
12we can make a channel named #forums

bot is now spamming up #Forums and the TST status window
12and the TST Status window?

07i wouldn't mind being some umbreon dragon mix though
yeah
that happens to me too
>_>
07more umbreon than dragon though
=o
Well then why are you using the nick? And that could potentially be a cool dragon :3
07lol
/me punches drf to shut up
07it made roara happy that i took the nick back
07anyway maybe with fur
/me punches Apple to not suck
07and scales under the fur, padded paws, about the size of an umbreon
03but it didn't work!
10<_<..
07a tail of a dragon
xD
And that sounds awesomecute.
07i should ask someone to draw it

10FFS STOP the apple bashing PLEASE
03I do, I just don't want to
12Feather
12one of these days we are going to drive drf out of here
12by making apple appreciation week
10[13:44:43] <%Feather> I love my iPod
10[13:44:50] <%Feather> I hasn't given me any trouble
10[13:44:58] <%Feather> I have no idea why you hate it so much
10*It
12one of these days we are going to drive drf out of here
12by making apple appreciation week
10haha
03it's so great that it disconnects you every 10 minutes
03:P
10IT'S NOT THE IPOD
10It's the app
03and that location crap you needed help with when you got the thing?
10I could just buy a better one if I really wanted to
03that's definitely the iPOd
10I finally got it to work, just needed to fix something
03still
03that's fricking nonstandard
03no putzing in router settings required

Feather
The wi-fi I have to say sucks
Trust me :|
In my own house I d/c so randomly
03also

03read that if you want :P
that dang iPad my dad let us test cut our connection right next to the dang router
and my laptop?
10I don't HAVE a mac
03even in the fricking Apple store
03I tried the iPad
03and it had like
I can have the laptop work upstairs
03dialup speed
03IN THE APPLE STORE
just fine
oh WOW
03I was like "Who buys this crap?"
03then again so did the iPods :P
03<Feather> I don't HAVE a mac <- Regardless, Apple still overcharges massive amounts for what their products are worth, iPods included
03like wtf iPod Nano? Why is it $200? My 8GB Sansa was $50 and has like 10 more features
10I agree with that, but still
10You can't get anything like an iPod Touch anywhere else
03they might work if you don't care about wasting money
03Yes you can
03haven't I proven this before?
10And don't say the Android, that's a phone
12apple supports al gore more
03http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16855501044&cm_re=android-_-55-501-044-_-Product <- $40 less than the 32GB iPod Touch, has a built in GPS... etc
12microsoft doesn't care about the enviroment
03Feather, Android is an operating system
03Droid is the phone
03it's like saying Windows for a computer
12environment*
12the polar ice caps are going to melt because of microsoft D:
10I thought they were the same thing... Droid was just short for it LOL
03nope
03Droid is Motorola Droid
03it's a phone
03Android has been around for years, the Google G1 was the first Android phone like what, 5 years ago?
03Droid was the first one on Verizon is all
03XD
10oh
03there's now a bunch
03Droid X, Droid 2, etc
03Motorola Backflip on AT&T
03Samsung Evo
07:)
03LOL "touche"
10And that product you posted
10it's an internet tablet
10isn't it?
03how is that different than an iPod?
03it plays music...
10Game player
10plays music
03OK see
10internet
03-d
03It runs Android
03Which can play music, games, IRC, etc etc
:3
10Probably not as much games as iPod
03I beg to differ
03http://www.androlib.com/ <- take a look around there, that has all the apps for Android in a website that you can search
03I have emulators of all the classic game systems on my phone
10I could do the same with my iPod lol
03I know, I'm just saying there's plenty of stuff for Android
03it's one of the more underrated products
03luckily now that the phones are doing well more people know about it
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/funny-facebook-surround-fai1.png LOL
meow
I read that mac article DRF
that's 100% true :3
03Yeah
/me sat on
03really the only reasons people like APple is the Reality Distortion Field
03that, and not knowing of the better products
03I've never *ever* seen a TV ad for the Sansa
03though supposedly they did advertise them like 3 years ago XD
and um Feather
[11:55:51] <%Feather> I could do the same with my iPod lol
That's a sad lie, unless you jailbreak which I found acgtually also makes it WORSE.

03nah
03Asus is better than Dell at least
03and HP
ASUS ROG is very good for people who want performance, even if it does lean slightly towards Alienware-type pricing
03my MSI is also :P
though I do see an offer of that same laptop for <£1200 ... if only I had managed to get a summer job
that thing's comparable with this desktop

5And my friend Alex is completely stoked about Black and White.
5Fire/Bug sounds so strange.
:o
Excuses! Loopy is just being mean D:
6oooh heads up
2its like lightning/water
My friend got fired from tim hortans
2o_O
6There are no evolutions or pre-evolutions of existing Pokemon in this generation,
never heard of it
2aww
5O:
5D:
What for?
it's Canadian
12LOOOOOOOOL!!!!! http://www.lugia.us/poll/happy-new-year.htm
2I like crispy Pokemans!
hes a big fat kid who got caught eating doughnuts
oh :3
2prevolutions
no joke.
XD
12What was I thinking LMAO
2MABEY
6ANYWAYS
it's our national coffee/doughnut shop ^^
5LET'S ALL TYPE IN CAPS.
6articuno
2What's the 2011 NY poll going to be like...?
6looks like the evolutions might be legit
6Oomura: I said, “How about a sea otter for the Water-type?” But if a sea otter were to evolve, what would it become? That’s where I hit a wall. Eventually I said that if a sea otter was to evolve, it would transform into something completely different. [Note: The third rumored evolution of Mijumaru from a few days ago looks completely different than Mijumaru.
And that's why :)
2YES LETS
6from the interview with the pokemon designers
yep
like dunkins? or starbucks?
2I LIKE TALKING IN CAPS
tim hortans is very canadian.
Not like dunkin doughnuts
The weird thing is, doughnuts are free if you're on shift
it's like starbucks
kinda
12That doesn't tell us anything O___o
5@Roara :: Well. That's kinda crazy.
Its got higher quality food.
6it does say enough
Tim Hortons is more of a restaurant though
2articuno
/me 2breaks everybody's caps!
It's a cross between a coffee shop and a deli
10I love this one XD
10http://www.lugia.us/poll/do-you-laugh-out-loud-in-real-life-when-you-say-lol.htm
its fast food but high quality.
6because if mijumaru's evolution is supposed to be far different....look at that the rumor is
Yeah
12LOL!
2you should make it so you dont have to dowload anything to listen to ICEcast =P
2I never!
12It's not that different
10I probably voted never XD
i've only seen a deli inside of walmart
5I would think that the Mijumaru evo would at least like mammalian..
walmart dely...
deli*
6articuno, how O_O
6it's WAY different
Haha
What do you get?
eeewww
lol tmi
lots of chiplote sauce
2haha: no laugh, lol: smile, LOL: giggle, ROFL: laugh
Well
That's why

sometimes its worth it :P
Dude
6o-o
ooo
Sweet onion sauce
i love chipotle!
2Jeepers....
me too.
:3 does canada have chipotle?
Yes
Honey mustard too
12It's just another blue otter
2LADIN VS USA
Im canadian.
2I WANT THAT
12But bigger..
best resturant evah
You know what I miss
noo not like that
6how do you see an otter in that?
5Wut the wut. o-o
12Kinda like Marshtomp and the last one
the hot mustard sauces from mcdonalds
oh, I just noticed, there are more Canadians talking here than any other country at the moment :O
5I don't see the otter either.
i mean Chipotle as in the resturant
2Polar Bears VS. GlobalWarming!
Haha
they discontinued them
Oh
I dont think so
what about panda express?
5But at least Marshtomp had some really obvious connections to Mudkip. o-o
I think we have that
:o nuh uh
12All the Pokemon change and look bigger/stronger but keep teh same features
yaaay
6it looks like some dragon canine hybrid thing
12Blaziken is a great example
12It looks nothing like a chick/chicken anymore
12But it's awesome
its chinese food right
6mijumaru's evolution chain is so way out of whack
5If I looked at Mijumaru's final evo and then Mijumaru, I probably wouldn't see the evolutionary connection.
2Or does it...
12No way, has a mustelid face
yes :D
6...
6http://pokebeach.com/news/0910/rumored-mijumaru-evos.jpg
ew
10bbl
uh ohz
i gotta go
2IS that you Suicune??
12That face looks like that of an otter/weasel a lot more than it's pre-evos..
Im getting into the forums this year for my onlineschool
2SuiKip
the last two years i never paid them any attention.
2!espeon
5Okay, maybe a LITTLE bit in the legs... And in the face.. But the snout is kinda long compared to the pre-evolutions.
2brb
6ok face aside, I still don't see it
12You mean like how an otter should be?
12Lol
6but aside from the face
6how does it related to mijumaru
6-d
12The face and the pose is aquatic..
12Like an otter
/me 2thinks it looks like a Seal
so far its been interesting, its all 14-19 year olds
6aquatic is a broad term lol
12How does Blaziken relate to Torchic or Combusken though?
6theres what....40 water type pokemon?
5But it's also a quadruped instead of bipedal.
6they're a lot more related than this thing
6it's clear they're birds
12Aquatic as in built for the sea.. as in.. NOT a dog..
2NOOOOO.....
6lol I still see dog
/me 2want's more fire types
6heavy-build, longer snout
12Yeh well it's clear that the evo is a mammal.. a bird is a broad term too, is it clear that Blaziken is a chicken?
2I still see a SealTomb
6but anyways
6that thing look NOTHING like an otter
6noooothing
12Face
6although-
6NOT EVEN LOL
2nah...
12It has a perfect otter face under all the whiskery thingies
6I can't use the "species" relation though...that got blown away after remoraid
6omg wait
12http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/images/2007/08/29/otter1a_470x350.jpg
6those are whiskers?
12I dunno what they are XD
6it looks like they're coming off the neck LOL
2Yes they are XD
5And Blaziken does have the same claws and colour scheme as Torchic.. But I agree that one's not THAT close to Torchic.
6mijumaru's line's color palette is so out of whack
6goes from pastel blue/white to tealish and dark blue to blue and gray
12I like that
12It gets better
6and the shells keep changing color
2It's change....
6I would like to see some consistency
6EITHER WAY
6these things better prove to be false
6I hate all of the
6m
5But the first and second-generation starters it was REALLY obvious what the lines were.
12I particularly like the snake but after this discussion I am REALLY starting to like the ottery thing
6even third and 4th gen were obvious
2Easy Cyndaquil-Typhloshion
6LOL
6well
hi all
5REALLY.
6yeah, these are all crap
12lies
6I like the starters 1st stages though
how is everyone?
6seriously look at that thing though
12I hate the first stages
6what happened to mijumaru's tail
6in the third stage, it's a fan
2Fine, but complain about the Starters in the 5th gen
12It got awesome
6before, it was a beaver
6that's ridiculously different
6like
6there's no consistency
6at all
6oh god
6I think this might actually be legit
2What's even more bad?
12It was always called an otter ovO
5What, the leaked images?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269uRYEUBd8 egads

2How do you know?
6I see a connection between the leaked images and the description in the interview
THAT is why people go for undubbed
6mijumaru's supposed to take on japanese culture, all three starters are regional
/me watches
lol
6mijumaru was supposed to be samurai like
Mijarus a clown >>
6I never said mijumaru wasn't an otter o_o
12Yeh it's a clown
6I said its evo isn't
2back
6its part narwhal
eeets a clown :P
/me meh.
12The voices just DONT fit the characters for a start....
5 I don't think of Tsutaaja as much of a snake. More like a lizard with a really long nose. >__>
6I can't see tsutaaja as a snake LOL
2Really LOOONG?
12The voice acting itself, no comment
12hmm
Arti, did you get to the kid yet?
12yep...
6tbh, it reminds me of a green anole
12It sounds like someone got on a mic
lol
/me 2wonders what kid...
12LOOOL.. it sounds like a vent convo.......
hey, Aurora, I just watching your vid that's on TST, nicely done ^^

6RP that;s my point
12i'm shocked, that is perhaps the worst voice acting I've ever heard ovO
6I don't see it as a snake
12I thought FFXIII was bad...
5Yeah.
2this makes me want to cut myself....
12LOL!!
6looking at this image here, with mijumaru's two evos
O.o
6it's pretty good to see how much they clash
2=/
6because the 2nd stage is already legit
really, how did that get through the production process
2I thought 4kids had bad acting...
2k well im going to go
6maybe not that color
6but
2peace out yall
12I should have gone already XD
12Ok night

10Why is this router being so stupid
/me plays the guitar for Feather
10it's brand new
/me 2plays chiptunes
03hm
03it could be your internet, not the router
10maybe
03you surprised I didn't say it was Apple's fault?
/me runs

10actually I am lol

oh, look, idling on an internet chat room AGAIN
2Feather has a Mac?
10no
2PHEW
Oh you've never idled on IRC before? :P
10I have a Dell laptop :P
Because I can think of several occasions.
2Yay Laptops
a lot of these fags sign on IRC for the sake of idling
03EW DELL
/me 2has a nice core i3 lenovo T410i Laptop, with 2 gigs of ram
it's as if it's embedded into their daily routines
10EW DRF
/me runs
to the point that it involved into a culture all its own where they think idling makes them look kickass.
I don't mind you being here, but seriously.
/me 2has a DELL Vostro 430 PC....
/me 2flys
10Dell Studio 15 here
I dunno if this is your kind of "funny" or whatnot but wow.
put up or ban me
03no but seriously Dell is such crap now
03MSI 15.4" custom build here
03though I'm on my desktop atm, also a custom build
Lol.
2My vostro 430 is pretty good
it's not humor.
humor is not a synonym for ripping on you 'tards.
just ban him :|
0/10 try again
i'm not trolling you either.
i don't need a reaction
(he is trolling)
/me 2wondered where his fish went...
I'm not sure, if he does then he's doing a really bad job.
just the fact that i make a <censored> who thinks he's tough <censored> eat his own is enough
i'm not sure about that.
you seem very inclined to ban me
if you want to cop out with troll, then that's fine
doesn't redeem you
Since it seems like you came here just to get banned, why not just leave~
i'm here because i can be.
he came around to look like an ass :|
So for real does anyone here play the ukulele?
10No, Peter

03Feather, have you tried plugging your computer directly into the modem and bypassing the router?
03or
03plugging it into the back of the router and not using wireless?
03brb
10...
isn't <br/> a break?
oh wait
What internet type do you have?
joining a conversation half an hour late >.>
/me goes back to youtube
10Quilava
10it was someone from another server
hm?
I got details already, thanks
10Apparently he's not usually like that
speshul type
/me ahem
it doesn't matter, he still did it
:/
Which self-terminates!
10I know
I'm not usually active :P
but I still talk
10yeah
well I suppose there goes his reputation
pfft
^
what reputation?
Is it working?
not being a troll
10no :/
Nah, he doesn't seem to be like that usually but then again I don't know him xD
You must have bad internet... or a horrible router
10He just trolls whenever he "feels like it"
lol
He's an awesome guy but none of you guys will ever know that sooooo
10Sooooo
10We bought a new router just weeks ago
10must be internet
I'm confused <.>
Okay o3o
I'ma go back to being bored and lonely
actually first..... what's LI?
10Lugia's Island
whats that?
/me 2wonders what the response to his laptop's wallpaper will be....
10a website
did it start before the new router?
did it start before the new router?
10yes
then it's your connection
Well, a website for another few moments anyway
unless you really don't know how to choose routers
2Are there any loose cables?
eh?
10We're closing it
how? :|
its your website?
10no
rm?
I think she's probably aware of things like loose cables
10it was a community organized website
Technically "ours", but at the same time, not really
10after the original owner left
O.o
meow
well that's her problem then
/me cough
well good night lol
'night
so... he's just pissed you're closing it down? :|
No
It was his idea in the first place
I think
then is he just stupid?
I'll leave that for you to decide

07besides Aerodactyl has good stats and was rock/flying
they're no longer alive
07Lugia called me so I would have an excuse not to talk to arrow's girlfriend about what type chcoolate the peregrine prefers

HGSS clearly pwns Black and White
07I was all z.z
12Lets ask the chan though, seriously? If you had a boyfriend/girlfriend, would you continuously chat about him/her and you to their ex when they;ve just broken up??
03I randomly bought myself a 1080p HD camcorder

12unless you were purposely trying to spite/hurt the ex?
nope
12Anyone else?
07lulz
I wouldn't do that
no
10Absolutely not
No, that sounds like an <censored> move to me.

with wings
10[17:33] <@Espeon> I need to express my disapproval. <- By commenting on my journal? :3
6YES
10oh
10your own journal
6I will have one of those too
10XD
10yes
6and I want ononokusu
6DIVE IS RETURNING
6AND ONLY 6 HMS
6yayy
6and they're all USEFUL
6for the most part
6but DIVE
6IT'S BACK
6<3
well, on a motorcycle that would either be uncomfortable and stupid :X
xD
woops
delete that either
I will comment as well DON'T FEAR
/me crosses it out
you'd get cold D:
and wet maybe
and then you crash and lose an arm D:
Arms are overrated :o
6ok seriously
Slash hay
6a GARBAGE BAG?
6WTF kind of design is that
I want to replace my arms with bear arms :o
/me commented on yours too
I should have the right to bear arms!
hmmm... well Demo only has one eye and no arm and peg legs and she seems to be doing okay. maybe you're right o:
arms*
wait
what
hold on
Dive is back
?
RSE remake, anyone?
/me runs
6RSE doesn't need a remake
6I've already explained why there wont be one
/obscure reference
Demo?
xD
k D:
Money can move mountains. And erase common sense.
umm it does, actually, Aurora
it deserves to be in 3-D
Curly I ride in a very small t Shirt usually :X
Kanto got it in SS and HG, so why not legendary Hoenn?
as long as its warm enough
6absolutely not
O.o
6Hoenn is compatible with the later-gen game stations
I still don't think it's a good idea, but oh well
6RBY and GSC were unable to transfer to RSE and beyond
6which is why they made remakes
I get that
motorcycle equipment is expensive as hell though >.>
$650 for a jacket, gloves and a helmet
6if they do remake hoenn, I doubt they will, I wont buy it
If I had a motorcycle, I'd want to ride in platemail >:3
I will
Hoenn's my favorite
that makes sense, but I still think they mostly want $$$
yeah
Hoenn sems cool
I wasn't buying anything for myself though
*seems cool
I'm probably going to end up buying everything off of Craigslist >.>
Also Roara
once they tried to redo the Lucario thing with Zoroark I actually got negative towards it.
6hoenn is my favorite region, RSE my favorite games
6I still will not buy a remake
brb rebooting
6because the original design is what I fell in love with
10Lyon's comment on my journal: They look too damn similar to their prevolutions to really warrant an evolution
and yeah that design was <3
10qft
I also liked the music
6that might have something to do with it
DPPt made me dissapoint
04rerally
04really*
6but again, if they didn't make a way to legitimately obtain all the earlier pokemon, that removes the original "gotta catch em all"
however the Vs Dialga/Palkia wasn't too bad
Platinum's Giratina battle was EPIC
yeah true
very true
6anyways
04what does qft mean?
...wait what're we talkin about?
6some of my favorite pokemon are in BW
6which is why I'm still interested
6otherwise
quoted for truth
04h
04ah*
heh
6I would have made the decision here and now to not get them
Sup everyone
04what is wrong with my spelling today?
gtfo Animé :<
...sounds like a type of sponge
/me runs
i dunno
Articuno still on ?
slasheh
lol hi
Damn and here I thought I finally got on in time
04I have to say they did pretty well with the bird/flying Pokemon in this generation, like Espeon said
04but most of these are just freaking shit
yes
To play or to sleep? D:
I mean it provoked ragefloof, it must be bad.
|3
heh
/me now belongs to Espeon for 8 minutes
I SEE YOU OVER THERE
03brb/bbl gonna install a new card reader in my PC
How's your day going drf
04Aekeosu is either an Archeopteryx or a vulture
04lol
I think somebody, just SOMEBODY, should try making their own pokemon based game wit htheir own original creatures
like
ones that don't look like their concepts were brought by 12-year-olds
Enjoy your financial banhammer.
Indeed
which sadly is what I think is the general public the Pokemon company is going towards
and lolz
Nintendo actually used to take down sites "defaming" Pokemans. At least a few. Then they gave up.
fangames
they can be awesome
play
and also wat
make something to eat too
...couldnt.
Thank you for your guideance
I thought oh Archeopteryx the moment I saw it! It's not that bad in fact.

brb.
/me bows.

Don't do the whole "your too slow!" thing, Ryan Drummond knew how to voice Sonic back in SA2 :<

2Someone needs to get the exterminators...
That's a BUG?!
6the cell has 125 sp attack o-o?

07that one I like, actually
6too bad that's in whiter version
that's a lance knight
6er
6white

2Or a Fluzzard
6zoroark better wind up as an in-game pokemo

2Oh well...
too bad you need to unlock it with an EVENT, though
>_<;;
07I find it weird how it's so high in the dex list though

6the interview
6but you've been gone

Even Gen 3 had Pikachu, lol
6http://pokebeach.com/2010/09/pokemon-peer-interview-translations
In one area yeah but still
6no I think it's brilliant
how so
6all the prior games have been in japan
they all have retarded names too >.
6this region will be new york
o_O
6makes sense to be unrelated
heh
Didn't catch the New York part
that DOES make sense then
but my question is
why is it Japan gets everything that's GOOD?
Oh right, look at real life
6dunno
/me RUNS
6we're getting reshiram
Roara
because they make everything thats good
you're fangirling over Reshiram :<
lol Flame
/me is getting henna done tomorrow ^-^
well heh
we get SOME cool ones
:O
where?
wait, its in new york?
wtf? r u serious?
also how is it that all those regions fit in Japan?
That's like, impossible
/me licks Kitten
6not really
However it would explain why everything's so small XD
6you've never seen the map?
I have
wow, only 2 i like of the whole list

o_o
Zebraika

<3
holy crap WOW

this kid in my class makes youtube videos. wanna see? xp
*!
03what's with the random red one
That's actually kinda cool
03on the top of the middle continent
thats the new map?
03is that like a ghost city LOL?
hmm?
oh
yeah
03fail
what IS that? o_O
wait
there's two of them
wtf
lol its a shadow pokemon factory XD
03yep
03also LOL
Lemme guess
03I just saw the funniest thing on Family Feud
One of them is the Sinjoh ruins
which is kinda wierd lol
03the question was "If a man is using Viagra, who does he not want to find out?" <- Probably the most inapropriate question I've heard on that show
03Sinnoh has ruins? o_O
...
10In HG/SS, yes DRF
03*Sinnoh*?
:E
no
03You can get to *Sinnoh* in HGSS?
Sinjoh
6the snowpoint ruins
03wtf Sinjoh?
yeah drf
03Thought that was a typo LOL
6HGSS takes you to shinjo, which is just north of johto
>_> lol oblivious
10http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sinjoh_Ruins
6NOT in sinnoh
derp
derpness
also heh
if that's so
at the highschool before the football game
then that random line should be more towards Johto
:/
07"just north of johto" my rear
07=P
i still havent beat ss
yeah
XD
:/
lol Flame, you fail
more like just north of the entire island
oh :3
03stupid Geico ads
im stuck at tthe red gyrados
But now the whole thing with redions makes perfect sense
because i cant catch it
03"Is a bird in the hand really worth 2 in the bush?" then yous ee a guy examing a dead bird
and i dont want to kill it
I never realized that until now o_o
03and he's like "Yeah, this is worth 2 in the bush"
03Seriously, WTF
07lol
07i remember that ad
6 17:09	Kyu	"just north of johto" my rear <-eh?
07based on that map
6what map
07if that's the real parts of japan that the regions are based on
"Did the little pig cry wee all the way home?" "WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
ah
DRF
I found it out
03I want a pic of that Sinjoh thing
03bulbapedia's doesn't work
lol
6shinjo isn't in sinnoh
6it's just north of johto
07that one
well hold on, here's the same map with lables
6yes it should be in the mountainous area just north of johto
03OK so
03why does my dorm's cable TV have an entire station that does nothing but play DirecTV 101 all day long
6http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/d/db/Shinto_Ruins_out_HGSS.png
That area north of japan is apparently the Ranger area
03LOLWUT Almia
Which makes enough sense
:D
YAY
03I thought that was just totrally irrelevant from the rest of the game
However where in Japan would Orrre be?
...
what?
I answered my own quesion LOL
6orre should be...
6eh?
03wait what
03is that the actual country of Japan?
07yes.
6yes
Look at the area where the Safari Zone should be
did you steal an ice cream truck for mmmeeeeeeeeeeeeee
03wow
03I mean
for Johto
?
03I know Kanto is an actual region in Japan
That island area looks a lot like Orre
03yeah I see a green thing, why
03o.o
03wtf is orre
10o-o
hm?
6orre, imo, is in that area west of johto
Where else would it be?
6not the island though
03is that Colosseum/XD?
yes
oh
03k
that area?
Well, besides that
heh
6of course, no one really has a location on there for orre
that does look a lot like it come to think of it

._.
03nope

03swearing is just stupid
ecactly Roara
03and people who swear are just stupid too
:P
*exactly
actually
that's a misconception
Because (delibrate) <censored>
6no, that's pretty true
6o_o
i didnt swear i typed an acronym
/me hides
>:
6yes but the acronym means something
6which
swearing excessivly can give the impression but just means they have no sense of judgement in their speach :/
6makes n sense lol
Hmm
6no
:P
look, not all people who swear are stupid :E
6most are
it's just stupid TO swear, however it's sadly common :<
well
/me 6runs
I sir swear on occasion, but I still have quite good speech capabilities.
07!umbreon please
Although I can't type.
6no, I know the difference
that's because the stupid people take swearing as a way of power
:D
like
thy think if they swear they have more power in their voice
*they
!umbreon
03though the other day I totally said the f-word without thinking x.x
my grandpa calls it b***ardizing the language XD
03and then I was like "WTF where did THAT come from"
07..
lolz
07what
03when I banged my head on my bed

I neeeeeeeeeed to get that
03XD
OH GOD NO XD
03well don't you have it for Xbox?
I usually only swear at lunch in school .____. I dunno why.
I have GH3 currently
03I only know how to hack custom songs on Wii
heh
03oh
well FL
03this is a RockBand 2 custom
03so eh
school is full of idiots
oh blah
ironically LOL
03in theory
03you could convert it
so the aura wafts around
03as the guy uploaded the .mid file
Indeed and they are quite good at making me mad
03but I really dunno how to put custom songs in the Xbox versions
causing one to stoop to one's level
yeah
So I get out my frustration during lunch.
Uh huh
...
:o
Xbox does the whole DLC crap
I only really swear at all when someone is like, offending me greatly, however sometimes I slip :E
I just saw all the new Black and White Pokémon
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE POKEYMANS!
/me hides
the problem is once you get used to something you don't see too much a problem in it and it kinda slips out lol
6ok I think this'll work
late
03so does Wii but it's hackable since it uses the SD card and not a hard drive
by a LONGSHOT XD
03though I kinda hate the RawkSD people :/
Where you go to school, do kids have contests to see who's the stupidest by swearing the loudest in lunch?
