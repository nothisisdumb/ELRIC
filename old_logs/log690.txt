<Dark92Enigma> Saturn, mine too!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait, if he had4 a speech problem, wouldn't they have at least practiced with him when he was a kid, especially if they knew he was going to be king?
<Kammerjunk> You know, Lionel should just start dancing.
<Kammerjunk> That'd help Berty.
<t3> exactly
<Dken2021> goody for you
<Kandarihu> So he just muted his pings? Thanks, Sumica.
<Combustiblelemons> That'd break the tensino Kammerjunk
<t3> and 'LIttle Mix' should start playing
<CrimsonPhoenix> ASoftFluffyThing, the title was about to go to his brother
<d3rb> saturn, what do you think of claire de lune by claude debussy?
<Combustiblelemons> tension*
<SirGanjalf> ASoftFluffyThing: He wasn't going to be a king
<t3> and everybody should breat into dance
<Sumica> 00,10ASoftFluffyThing, he was not planed to be the king
<LordDerpington> They didn't know he'd be king though. His brother abdicated less than a year after taking the throne.
<somepony_else> ASoftFluffyThing: his older brother was supposed to be king
<Sumica> 00,10he was the younger brother
<rdibp|evil> ASoftFluffyThing: Plat holes, plot holes everywhere
<SirGanjalf> ASoftFluffyThing: His brother should be a king
<Bunny_Striker> Satrun: something`s wrong about you, but I cant get my finger on it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohhhhhh.
<SirGanjalf> ASoftFluffyThing: But then he divorced and ran
<SirGanjalf> so faaar awaaaaaay...
<Dken2021> I do like this piece, very soothing
<LordDerpington> That's not a plot hole, that actually happened for real.
<rdibp|evil> did guys
<Kandarihu> Or what if all the pings he got were delayed instead of muted, and we hear them all in rapid succession when the speech is done?
<t3> dizz guiz
<ASoftFluffyThing> Thanks SirGanjalf, Sumica, somepony_else, rdibp|evil, and CrimsonPhoenix
<SirGanjalf> and here's the brother
<Kammerjunk> Brother Douche.

<SirGanjalf> His brrother is the Douche of York:P
<SirGanjalf> *brother
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<t3> but they had to make it film-worthy D:
<Invi> Kammerjunk, then be gald taht the brother didn't become king ^^
<rdibp|evil> dat epic music
<CrimsonPhoenix> what I don't get was why exactly did his brother abdicated to be king
<Kammerjunk> Hey, no smoking, solly!
<Combustiblelemons> Will it be the full 9 minute speech?
<Invi> <.< yeah gald. gald > glad
<DaringDerpy> he convicted millions of young people to death on the battlefield. very glorious
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: cause he wanted to marry a slut
<t3> what I don't get was why exactly did his brother abducted the king
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: he wanted to marry a divorced woman, which wasnt allwoed for a king
<SirGanjalf> dat Winston
<t3> :)
<Lil_B> remind me to later listen to this movement again

<DaringDerpy> ouchie
<Kammerjunk> Malmortius: As a teenager, I can safely tell you that most teenagers are douchebags.
<Iwa> Malmortius: Exactly...Like asking a 5 year old to arm wrestle a college jock
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, I'm not a chicken
<superretroworld> no pony?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> HXC!!

<LordDerpington> Toot
<applejack`> me?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, you're a turkey
<pot80> NOBODY calles me chicken
<pony_300> all things considered, equestrian dragons are pretty badass. Lava is like a SWIMMING POOL to them.
<Dken2021> that would really hurt, since it's melted rock
<cow334> ...dem lava would kill any pony
<cow334> ...
<Barbetos|AtWork> Present the ass!
<Sumica> 00,10all the adult dragons are like "fucking kids"
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Must be hard to swim through lava. It's quite thick.

<Lyra`_combatmedic> dragons party soft

<Jake> if you swim in syrup you are as fast as in water. guess that applys for lava too
<rdibp|evil> Spike: SCREW FRIENDSHIP! I HAVE DIAMONDS
<DrainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, actually there are many different kinds of lava, some thick, some very much liquid
<Lyra`_combatmedic> all they do is eat a lot
<Applejack2012> Everfree forest
<Dark92Enigma> FOOOOOOOOREEEEEVEEEEER!!!!!
<Lyra`_combatmedic> they didnt even get wasted.
<Spectrum_Rush> Barbetos|AtWork: loyal friend :P
<Sumica> 00,10I went on a dragon raid once. I won the roll for the mount.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sure.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whatver.
<SirGanjalf> dat raid
<MI9000> head smack
<cow334> whats wrong with that dragan
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rd is the element of RD.
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: Then again, he IS "in the moment" and doesn't know that Twi and her friends followed him.
<cow334> ...Dafuq
<rdibp|evil> i guess you are gonna MISS the dragon raid
<Kammerjunk> Sumica: You kill me.
<sonicdude558> o rly Sumica
<doctor_whooves127> ok i dont see the problem so far they havent been all that bad
<MI9000> crackle flying

<Dark92Enigma> WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND THE MARE WHO RAISED YOU AS A CHILD????
<Dken2021> wait, spike, you should be equipping youself before the raid
<MI9000> fabulous costume
<Lyra`_combatmedic> rawr
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hoof it
<Malmortius> Twilight doesn't use her magic enough :(
<rdibp|evil> Rainbow Dash has a sudden concern for Spike in this episode
<pony99637> lol
<Yahooz> Also, Derpys legs
<Applejack2012> needs big fire breath and wings in S3
<Kammerjunk> Dken2021: Spike level 5 man.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT PUN :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phoenixes
<Kammerjunk> level 5, man*
<CrimsonPhoenix> <3
<superretroworld> isnt that the pheonix from se 1?
<Malmortius> I mean, she lifted an ursa minor and a giant metal water tower
<CrimsonPhoenix> superretroworld, nope
<Applejack2012> phoenixes!
<pony99637> :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> they actually look different
<Buytoast> kill them spake
<pony99637> :[
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ho shit son!
<Sumica> 00,10the the phoenix boss sucked on that raid
<sub06905> ded
<rdibp|evil> hes ded
<Applejack2012> S3 needs more phoenix
<Buytoast> slaughter tham and bathe in their flaming blood
<Dken2021> superretroworld wild phoenixes, the one you saw is own by celestia
<Sumica> 00,10noting to tank
<sonicdude558> oh my
<LordDerpington> I think Philomena would still be Celestia's pet. These are wild phoenixes.
<rdibp|evil> :O EVIL!!!!
<L_Y_R_A> oops...
<MI9000> twilight didnt teleport because she didnt know the area or where thry were going
<superretroworld> oh
<LordDerpington> Dark, dude.
<Kotano> hello again
<sonicdude558> hi Kotano
<Malmortius> couldnt she levitate herself mi9000 ;p
<sonicdude558> :P
<Malmortius> well, levitate the 3 of them
<Conyst> I am selling pony scout cookies and was wondering if you wanted to buy any.
<nonody2> Beware the troll phoenixes
<sub06905> ^
<pot80> "You may hate him, but you have to admit... Dumbledores got stlye" XDD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, levitation requires energy depending on weight
<Azuredragon> Phoenix fire can leave burns on dragons that can swim in lava...
<AJIsAwesome> 36 pound Phoenix.
<CrimsonPhoenix> lifting three ponies by magic is a lot
<Applejack2012> Harry Potter approves
<sub06905> solar flare
<MI9000> the light!
<pony_300> TAIYOKEEENNN
<LordDerpington> Phoenix used flash. It's super effective!
<DrainbowAsh> Trees. What are they made off in Equestria?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm GET THE TABLES
<J_E_Smith71> Oh there's that Dusk's Dawn fan ep I talked about
<Spectrum_Rush> MY EYES
<pony99637> SOLAR FLARE!!!!!
<doctor_whooves127> solar flare
<Malmortius> CrimsonPhoenix: but twilight in another episode lifted an ursa minor and a giant water tower ;P

<Dark92Enigma> SOLAR FLARE!!!!!!
<cow334> moltress lived
<cow334> yaay
<Kammerjunk> Malmortius: She probably thought it wise to preserve her energy.
<Dark92Enigma> FUERA ABAJO
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, and you saw how much energy THAT took?
<LordDerpington> And it damn near killed her.
<Malmortius> true, true.
<sub06905> Smash it!
<rdibp|evil> .....WHY
<MI9000> she also didnt know where they were going or the area
<AJIsAwesome> SMASH THE PRECIOUS!
<Dark92Enigma> NO
<Kammerjunk> And I THREW IT ON THE GROUND
<Applejack2012> dragon used smash
<cow334> he wont
<pot80> Hurrrp Durrrrp
<Thrackerzod> I THREW IT ON THE GROUND
<CrimsonPhoenix> She even had to stand completely still due to the force of the magic
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat peer pressure
<Lyra`_combatmedic> in this episode, they teach kids that its wrong to kill pets
<Applejack2012> not
<kirzstryfe> isn't the purple one supposed to be out collecting clow cards?
<nonody2> NO
<Dark92Enigma> SAY NO TO PEER PRESSURE
<rdibp|evil> WAT U SAY
<doctor_whooves127> this is kinda wierd why do dragons hate pheonixs
<CrimsonPhoenix> time for Rarity to be bad-ass
<rdibp|evil> PUT EM UP PUT EM UUUP

<Dark92Enigma> HOOF EM' UP!
<Kammerjunk> Rarity sure is a lady.
<Sonny> lol @ rarity
<Invi> doctor_whooves127, they don't. they are just douches
<pot80> The moral of the episode is not to have egg sandwiches
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC RARITY!
<sub06905> Sumica: :D
<pony_300> Rarity's a ride or die pony
<eleanorawesome> ;)
<L_Y_R_A> "ill rip you to peices"...umm...

<rdibp|evil> WAAAARP ZPOOOOOOOOOOOOONE
<sub06905> OP
<Kammerjunk> Dark92Enigma: When danger reared it's ugly head...
<DrainbowAsh> Considering that Phoenixes are immortal, aren't the dragons preventing the collapse of the ecosystem by keeping their numbers in check?
<Dken2021> No spike, you won't gain experience tht way
<Sumica> 00,10OP twilie is OP

<ekips> SPike lost 10% of his XP from running away

Fun fact: While Blossom can freeze objects and Bubbles can understand both foreign languages and communicate with animals, Buttercup is the only one without a unique power.

<CrimsonPhoenix> hai Lauren
<rdibp|evil> FOUND HER
<AJIsAwesome> Craig McCracken/10
<sonicdude558> hi bro
<L_Y_R_A> E=MC^2
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hai Lauren again
<Kandarihu> Story by: Lauren Faust
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its almost Planet Side 2 time
<Kotano> night Dragon1029
<Lasharus> prince-dari - like my pick of Spaceballs? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hai Lauren again
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its going to be SO AWESOME
<Purple`Prose> Dear Princess Celestia: Today I learned that every problem can be solved either by cursing and swearing loudly, or by application of violence. It doesn't matter if you're Pre-WWII Britain or a trio of little girls. Your faithful student, Purple Prose.
<Kammerjunk> Craig McCracken!
<rdibp|evil> SLAPPY PAPPY/10
<LordDerpington> We've had some serious fun with the B movies.
<pankreas> prince-dari exactly my opinion
<Applejack2012> hi
<Lyra`> prince-dari, you talking crazy
<red_ony> oh well
<J_E_Smith71> Amy Keating Rogers too
<Dken2021> prince-dari even blazing saddles?
<Bromany> E = MC Hammer
<Kandarihu> Written and Storyboarded by Lauren Faust Character Design
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: true, although this is mostly just nostalgic
<AJIsAwesome> DAT Craig McCracken
<Lil_B> Invi could have still been better, this was about as good a a 2 Part TV Episode
<L_Y_R_A> NOPE
<Kotano> oh Lauren Faust,you wonderful,wonderful person
<Yahooz> prince-dari: i would say best B movie of bronystate's second year
<RAWRity> prince-dari: mostly because those are the ones with the most character and personality. A lot of A films are enjoyable, but rather generic.
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/?i=2862
<Lyra`> also, can i suggest 5 episodes of the orriginal doctor who as a B movie?
<Applejack2012> needs to see Blazing
<VenHur> ...Yeeeeaaaaah...I can understand this movie is the B movie due to being a box office failure, but... *sigh*
<TheMaster> Lauren Faust did a lot
<Kandarihu> Additional Character Animation
<cow334> i enjoyed the movie
<CrimsonPhoenix> again Lauren
<Ta_Dikin> Lauren
<VenHur> Damn the media.
<Kandarihu> Character Layout Supervisor
<twilight_sprinkle> Bromany: its missing a square.
<J_E_Smith71> And the credits get cut off
<Invi> white stripes? no?
<rdibp|evil> i have a dream
<Brony_Pony26> i like this song
<Kammerjunk> Azuredragon: As the only one of the bunch.
<Kotano> VenHur : Really,it bombed?How much did it lose?
<Bromany> oh, shame on me :(
<J_E_Smith71> So here comes an abrupt switch to the pony ep
<TheKoreanBrony1354> song
<prince-dari> Nah, Evil Dead II, Deathstalker II, Battlefield Leverage
<Kandarihu> This song was used on the ads for this movie.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> dfsf
<Azuredragon> http://www.topix.com/forum/tv/the-powerpuff-girls/T2BIGEUP5ET17JT4D
<Invi> rdibp|evil, who is the band?
<sonicdude558> Sumi
<VenHur> Kotano: I don't know.
<Lasharus> prince-dari, how dare you not acknowledge Spaceballs?
<rdibp|evil> Sumipan
<prince-dari> And probably Black Dynamite too
<RAWRity> prince-dari: let's be fair now. Battlefield Leveraage wasn't a god film.
<sonicandmario85> WOAH
<RAWRity> (good
<prince-dari> Those are my favourites out of al lthe films we've had I think.
<RAWRity> *good

<Applejack2012> there was a removed party episode in S1?
<L_Y_R_A> I WILL NOT RARITY
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/2309.png
<pony_300> malmortius: that will be demonstrated later in the episode.
<Applejack2012> for Equestria!
<sonicdude558> bewm
<cow334> dam, rarity
<Applejack2012> lasor
<L_Y_R_A> ALIFLY
<thelonepony> Rarity is best friend!
<Bromany> nice one azuredragon
<Invi> wait, no intro?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, I don't know, she's best pony in my book
<sonicdude558> DERPY
<pot80> what no there was a party in the 1st ep
<TheKoreanBrony1354> gd
<Dken2021> Malmortius although she is the element of generousity, people feel like she uses ponies to get what she wants
<Azuredragon> :P
<P0N1S> douchbags
<Malmortius> Yep, rarity is my favourite pony too.
<sonicdude558> :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_300, she actually just got over herself in this episode
<Applejack2012> Rarity is best
<Megalomanic> dat tail whip
<TheKoreanBrony1354> GINERS

<Invi> Sumica, no intro? ^^
<TheKoreanBrony1354> gingers

<Malmortius> HAR HAR!
<DewlShock> I'm betting season 3 has a rainbow getting kicked out of flight school ep
<sonicdude558> 100,000
<PS3-Brony> HA HA
<twilight_sprinkle> gg fluttershy, gg
<sub06905> damnit fluttershy
<Alchemist> fluttershy stahp
<pot80> wait if rd did a sonic rainboom and is the only one who can do it... Why are they saying she can't!
<L_Y_R_A> REMEMBER OBAMA YOU FREAKING WINGED HORSE..."YES WE CAN!!!"
<LordDerpington> I thought that too, first time I heard him. It's not though - Nelson is Nancy Cartwright.
<cachi01> hi everypony :) who won the lotto??????'
<pony_300> CrimsonPhoenix: which is also ignored, yup. I think of Rarity as the rich bitch you find on sitcoms, if they hactually gave a shit about anything other than themselves.
<sub06905> flootershai pls
<Bogy> oh flutters..
<TheKoreanBrony1354> dont hate on fluttershy
<Kotano> wow,Fluttershy is evil
<cow334> non belivers
<Ponyloverforever> Malmortus: he IS nelson
<RainbowAsh> pot80, because they didn't really get to see it
<Malmortius> dem wings
<Malmortius> HNNGGG
<Buytoast> but rarity doesn't care about anybody but herself
<Invi> butt wings ^^
<Applejack2012> so epic
<sonicdude558> :O
<twilight_sprinkle> SMASHING
<Brony_Pony26> ok what i think the first ep of seaons 3 is they will have to rescue like princess celestias mom aka the quenn
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, cachi01. Can't remember. I'll let you know when it gets posted. :)
<sonicdude558> Wii
<cow334> Buytoast: nope
<twilight_sprinkle> NYAAAAR
<sonicdude558> Nintendo Wii
<Brony_Pony26> *queen
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_300, yeah that's quite a stretch
<cow334> et ready for drama
<L_Y_R_A> WAIT JUST A SECOOOOOOND...ARE THOSE WINGS ON HER FLANKS!?!?!?
<cow334> ...
<Alchemist> hi hasbro toy
<CrimsonPhoenix> and if Rarity was rich she would be in canterlot
<cachi01> Buytoast: you misspelled rainbow dash
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're almost attached to her butt.
<pankreas> and now felix baumgartner
<AJIsAwesome> L_Y_R_A: No.
<LordDerpington> Buttwings.
<sub06905> HAX
<Applejack2012> hiu
<Kotano> sorry,Pegasi,but you're obsolete now.We got magic for that!
<Malmortius> cartwheel
<Buytoast> they boht don't care about anybody else
<eleanorawesome> :D
<Buytoast> it's why they're the worst characteres
<Iwa> *cough* Butt Stalion :P
<cow334> how did she learn tp fly so face.....
<cow334> fast
<AJIsAwesome> Even with magic, Pinkie would still be able to walk on clouds. :D
<AJIsAwesome> *without
<LordDerpington> Part of the spell, I guess.
<Metronome> Unicorn is OP
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<sonicdude558> ooooooooooo
<Malmortius> If twilight can make ursa minor float, why cant she levitate herself?
<Applejack2012> that woa
<pot80> RainbowAsh: But they were in the race where rd did the rainboom on another race?
<sub06905> seems like lyra learned the same spell also
<pot80> *episods
<Ponyloverforever> WHOAH
<LordDerpington> Skyra.
<twilight_sprinkle> unicorns are the master race
<Invi> Malmortius, have you seen how much effort she put in that?
<Haberdash> i dont get how twilight doesnt magic herself with wings one day?
<Azuredragon> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f4c6MGTL_2Y/UHngIJebEDI/AAAAAAAA8hM/tzevNArkCzc/s1600/1.png I WANT IT NOOOOW
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, again it takes a shit load of energy
<Applejack2012> modern tools canon
<Brony_Pony26> cant wait for the YEAH!!! moment
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: you misspelled pegasus
<Malmortius> but ursa minor was huge compared to twilight ;p
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: how? unicorns can do everything
<cow334> uh oh...
<sonicdude558> another ping Sumi
<L_Y_R_A> in other-words...THE FILLY KILLING ROOM
<cow334> wait only on fanfiction so were are good
<eleanorawesome> incoming fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, so Twillight will levitate herself CONSTANTLY during the WHOLE episode?
<pony_300> CrimsonPhoenix: she has ambitions to be a part of high society, hates getting dirty, loves fashion, definitely wants to be rich and successful. She's just missing the "treat people like crap" aspect and instead cares and does things for others.
<Malmortius> WOOAAAHH!
<sub06905> "Weather" Factory
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: but.....but pegasus have.......uhmmm.........wingboners?
<Brony_Pony26> back in a sec gonna get a sandwich
<Haberdash> and next the rainbow factory
<LordDerpington> But levitating the Ursa was pushing her into the ground. A weightlifter might be able to lift more than his own body weight, but that doesn't mean he can lift himself off the ground.
<Mega_Milk> Front line on the morning paper: Pony dead. Cause of death: Falling jack hammer.
<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: "Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than you."
<pony_300> thus, a not-Rich bitch!
<cow334> he drop that...Later that day some earth pony died
<Applejack2012> that rainbow pun
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: but unicorns have horns ;p
<RainbowAsh> pot80, two of them were in the same race, but one crashed and the other was thrown off track right before the rainboom
<Haberdash> SPICY
<Ta_Dikin> Spicy!!!!!!!!1

<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: Le me abandons thread
<Buytoast> boy pony_300, you keep defending the worst pony
<Buytoast> what a shame
<twilight_sprinkle> lol cashieoh-wan
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: No, they can't. For example, Unicorns are notoriously bad at farming-- as are Pegasai. The technical term for a farm run by unicorns is desert, and for one run by pegasai is swamp.
<Haberdash> uhhh DORK!
<J_E_Smith71> I'd taste the rainbow, but it's too hot to handle
<pony_300> oh yea and sometimes she can be self-centered.
<pot80> RainbowAsh: ok just wandering :P
<Buytoast> sometimes?
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Oh, you. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: what about the eps when twi used her magic to harvest apples
<Buytoast> you spelled always wrong there
<sonicdude558> Spoilers: eeeenope
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Harvesting ain't the same thing as growing.
<Malmortius> All the other ponies are too perfect, i like rarity because she has an obvious flaw, she can be self centered. But she really cares for her friends when it matters.
<Lyra`> dumplings are good :3
<pony_300> Buytoast: heh. I like a bitch who's ready to throw down with the best of them, and is not REALLY a bitch. :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_300, I guess, but if you want me to explain my view on Rarity I would just give you a chapter of a fanfic cause it reflect everything on how I thought about her
<Haberdash> bwa haha
<sub06905> Rarity pls go
<CrimsonPhoenix> WA HA HAAA
<sonicdude558> wo hahaha!
<Malmortius> WAHAHA
<Buytoast> but she really is a bitch
<Mega_Milk> Dat laugh -lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Malmortius: only twi is almost perfect~
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love you Tabitha
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much
<J_E_Smith71> Rarity you show off
<Applejack2012> those rarity noises
<Invi> Buytoast, naw, she isn't
<Haberdash> granny smith
<J_E_Smith71> Her laugh there was epic
<Applejack2012> Granny SMith in heaven
<cachi01> dat granny smith recolor
<pony_2901> yes
<Malmortius> aren't they wondering why she has a horn AND wings?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: well maybe, but i suspect they can spawn food anyway
<sonicdude558> lol a Balloon
<cow334> danm dude rarity needs to chill always wanting to take the spot light
<cow334> ._.
<L_Y_R_A> ITS OFFICIAL...GRANY SLITH DIED
<sonicdude558> Derpy recolor
<sonicdude558> Derpy
<L_Y_R_A> *smith
<Buytoast> she's the most selfish horse
<Applejack2012> winged Hooves
<Buytoast> what do you espect
<pankreas> derp
<Invi> pling*
<cachi01> we dont care about granny slith!
<cow334> O-O
<cow334> I never saw that
<LordDerpington> Oh, Derpy. We do love you so.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Haberdash> what movie was playin 4 hours ago?
<pot80> Malmortius: well there is celestia and luna :P
<cachi01> we care about granny smith!
<sonicdude558> Celesha

<LordDerpington> Haberdash: The King's Speech

<J_E_Smith71> Haberdash: We had King's Speech and PPG
<twilight_sprinkle> long live the lunar republic
<CrimsonPhoenix> JOHN MADDEN
<Saturn> 08,01celestia is so fucking pretty
<Saturn> 08,01i want her mane
<cachi01> 9999
<sonicdude558> kabooms
<Malmortius> If you just got the ability to fly, wouldnt you be a bit excited too? You people think one flaw makes her scum. Jeez, shes a little showoff-y, chill.
<Applejack2012> i like her mane
<Haberdash> k thanks
<L_Y_R_A> WORST RECOLOR EVER GOES TO...THE PINK CELESTIA TOY!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: You prefer Celestia over Luna?
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: Canon hold it as opnly Earth Ponies can successfully grow food-- at least any that's worth a damn. And Twilight Sparkle, is, after all, something of an aberration, most unicorns have no-where the capability she does.
<giveasmilegetasmile> Satern: so true
<GilDash> Dat Spitfire.
<cachi01> L_Y_R_A: amen
<Buytoast> but it's an incredible flaw
<L_Y_R_A> XD
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: i do, yeah
<Buytoast> that's why she's the worst
<cow334> Malmortius: but shes rubbing it in
<Megalomanic> I like Celestia...
<pony_300> CrimsonPhoenix: reading? NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! Srsly, I do remember the days when I used to love reading fanfics but then I grew out of the groove...... but maybe my developing ADD has something to do with that...
<Malmortius> Shes not rubbing it in on purpose.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dr Whooves
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Me too.
<pony_300> nomnomnomnom haaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
<Haberdash> doctor who pegasus
<sonicdude558> dat Dr Whooves voice
<pot80> well Its another american steriotype
<J_E_Smith71> Much on that hay Doctor
<CrimsonPhoenix> pony_300, most likely
<L_Y_R_A> umm...when did he get wings?
<alexxm> doctor whooves is easily confused
<sub06905> dat caramel
<J_E_Smith71> Munch
<Brony_Pony26> im back
<Megalomanic> Leeeeerooooooy!
<sonicdude558> DERPY
<Rosfox> WINGKIIIINS
<J_E_Smith71> The Doctor must have been doing experiments on himself to get them wings
<CrimsonPhoenix> which is a shame too cause what I want to share gives a lot of insight in personal life and all
<cow334> derpy woohoo
<sonicdude558> Do a Barrel Roll!
<Haberdash> that instructor sounds like lois from family guy
<LordDerpington> Do a barrel roll!
<sonicdude558> Ninja'd LordDerpington
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: we havent seen much of other unicorns' capabilities though
<cow334> LEERRROYY
<Malmortius> cant sleep, clown will eat me.
<Kotano> dat breakdown
<Forgottencrow> WHORE
<pot80> ITS HORRIBLE
<LordDerpington> Rarity, you look like a tart.
<Haberdash> DAT MAKE OVER
<Brony_Pony26> here we go
<sub06905> Rarity pls go, go now
<soulrider95> Rarity, you look like a poptart
<VenHur> ....Ew...
<Malmortius> This is the only episode i dont like rarity, too much make up :(
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: We've seen enough to identify the exceptional from the average.
<J_E_Smith71> A bit too much there, eh Rarity?
<nonody2> FINGERS
<Saturn> 08,01good thing there's only one of her
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: WAY too much makeup. :D
<Saturn> 08,01other wise, there would be
<L_Y_R_A> RAINBOWS ONLY FEAR...FAILURE
<Megalomanic> Makeup, you've got some Rarity on you.
<Saturn> 08,01*sunglasses*
<Saturn> 08,01a jam of tarts.
<Saturn> 08,01YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH
<pankreas> saturn :D
<cow334> ...oh god
<cow334> o-o
<Invi> :D
<pot80> OH hell
<Mega_Milk> Saturn: :D
<cachi01> rainbow ass
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Oh, you! :D
<Haberdash> youre gona go for kid
<sonicdude558> hit?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: well twi is obviously excpetional, but i dont think weve seen much of average unicorn abilities
<sonicdude558> yes
<Bogy> :/
<Applejack2012> humans canon
<ASoftFluffyThing> Can I be honest? I think Rarity looks ugly with all that extra unnesseary makeup and clothing on.
<nonody2> Damn those douchebags
<eleanorawesome> ^
<Wrek> 05been watching bullshit all day :|
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Agreed.
<ASoftFluffyThing> She just overkilled overkill.
<Buytoast> but that's her inner personality showing
<Bogy> ASoftFluffyThing: you're right..
<twilight_sprinkle> Applejack2012: humans have been in equestria on g1 tho
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: I feel the same. And she i smy second favorite pony -lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek watches Toilet TV.
<Saturn> 08,01Applejack2012: it was pinkie pie wearing it, so it may only be canon inside her head
<pot80> why the long face? i dont even know
<AdamTheDuck> Then stop watching bullshit and watch ponies Wrek :3
<Saturn> 08,01which is perfectly reasonable
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: its a good channel
<sonicdude558> There goes rarity ;)
<Saturn> 08,01as she is medium aware
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: You watched the twilight movies?
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: bulls dont use toilets though
<sonicdude558> 1... 2... 3...
<Applejack2012> lets play with ponies!
<Invi> boom?
<Malmortius> have you ever seen it when a child finds makeup and covers herself in it to imitate their mother/girls in magazines? its like that. Chill.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now for the moment that convert most people into the MLP fandom
<P0N1S> not like that
<Iwa> ASoftFluffyThing: Honestly, I think almost every sentient being looks horrendous with too much Make-up
<Wrek> 05no... penn and tellers bullshit
<Haberdash> anyone seen guiles theme version of this?
<pot80> By years she means untill the next ep
<Malmortius> shes just went overboard :(
<Ta_Dikin> Rarity = Icarus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus
<pony_300> srsly, that lipstick is abit much
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then her wings fall off.
<Applejack2012> free fall
<cachi01> CrimsonPhoenix: this one? i thought it was when that piano fell on twilight
<Invi> CrimsonPhoenix, tbh, the photo fnish episode did it for me .__.
<sonicdude558> yay
<Brony_Pony26> shit just got real
<cow334> ohh no
<pankreas> i am falling down
<Saturn> 08,01der[pu!
<P0N1S> D34PY
<Saturn> 08,01*derpy
<pony_300> derppppppppppy :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I say most people
<Haberdash> you dont say
<pot80> TAKE THAT YOU ****
<cachi01> der[pu
<ASoftFluffyThing> Iwa, I know. But Rarity obviously doesn't know the meaning between normal makeup and OHMYGODSCARYCLOWNPONY makeup
<LordDerpington> Applebuck Season had me hooked.
<Applejack2012> save us Derpy
<Lyra`> XD im not even a quarter short of electronic funds for this game i want >.<
<ASoftFluffyThing> In this episode at least
<twilight_sprinkle> i bet celestia did that, she didnt like how Rarity was posing in front of the sun
<Applejack2012> I started with Appleebuck Season too
<pankreas> in your face!
<Malmortius> DAT MUSIC
<GilDash> Nooo, Spitfire. :O

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Until Cutie Mark Chronicles Sumica.
<Brony_Pony26> LOL
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica: Unless Canterlot Wedding gets played
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well Sumica that's good since it's a rare thing

<Invi> Saturn, awesome ^^ we should have met somewhere ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sonic Rainboom in 3 episodes
<Thrackerzod> Saturn Im proof i need it
<cachi01> for saving your lifes. and for doing an impossible trick. i present you with this invaluable plastic piece of shit
<Saturn> 08,01Invi: there's always next year!
<Haberdash> BEST DAY EVA

<twilight_sprinkle> if theres one in chronicles and wedding, then thats 4 eps

<Applejack2012> best.wedding.ever
<Malmortius> suckups.
<Saturn> 08,01you'll just have to take my word for it
<Jesse_> Those two have no more friends.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't think you went to Galacon Saturn.
<ekips> Don't forget to call me too when you are in Germany next time Saturn :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> This one with the title of the same name, Cutie Mark Chronicles, Canterlot Wedding Part 2
<cow334> but yet she still cant get into the wonderbolts./
<Invi> Saturn, I'm not sure if i can make it
<Jesse_> I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
<Saturn> 08,01oooooh my

<Cranberry_Scotch> There's a fic detailing that day
<twilight_sprinkle> fraaaaaaaaaaaaaaancis
<Jesse_> O.o?
<Malmortius> I think the reason i like rarity the most is because shes the most balanced pony. Fluttershy is generally shy, rainbow dash is boyish, twilight - levelheaded
<LordDerpington> Thanks for another great movie night!

<BroPony|MEDIC> superretroworld: Well, everyday outside of chats on what not, im always being accused of bragging about how im a brony, just because im seen with mlp stuff, or heard watching mlp and it really irritates me how they think im a homosexual for it, and i just dont understan the problem

<Jesse_> This game looks hawt...
<AJIsAwesome_> I freaking love JonTron. :D
<cachi01> ^
<Buytoast> but JonTron is a horrible person
<Buytoast> with terrible opnions
*DJPON3 chat about jontron im out
<[SWAG]Haku> Twilight Plushie is about to got to war
<AJIsAwesome_> Opinion.
<AJIsAwesome_> That's YOUR opinion, not mine.
<Buytoast> no, this is actually a truth
<DashWithRainbows> lawls
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: opinions aside, why is he a terrible person
<AJIsAwesome_> NOPE, opinion.
<Dken2021> I used to like Egoraptor, still like him too
<Buytoast> if i were to explain why he is, i'd be banned for saying some unsavory things
<cachi01> EGORAPTOR WINS ALL OVER
<Jesse_> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<Colt_Brovakiin> do it!
<pony_7018> do a barrel roll!!!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: soubtful

<Thrackerzod> i havent found a legitamate reason to hate johntron
<[SWAG]Haku> Hi otakon who is now 17

<otakon17> And what won lottery
<[SWAG]Haku> No one won lotteery
<Dken2021> [SWAG]Haku ah yes, that was like a childhood of mine, watching stick videos and whatnot
<DashWithRainbows> Yahooz What about Robbaz?
<Buytoast> but i don;t need to defend a truth
*Bronysith locks otakon17 in a room with kinky pie
<Buytoast> JonTron is terrible
<Yahooz> DashWithRainbows: sure
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon17: alexxm with my a movie kung fu hustle, dont rememebr what else
<LunasGuard> ello everypony, cool twilight Wrek
<DashWithRainbows> :3
<Dken2021> lali-ho LunasGuard
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai LunasGuard
<cachi01> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvy05ytjvt1qaber4o1_500.gif
<superretroworld> is jontron a brony?
<Yahooz> Also LagX
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: you have to prove a truth first
<cachi01> hi LunasGuard :)
<otakon17> twilight_sprinkle: kung Fu for A?
<Jesse_> This game looks like it needs a story mode...
<Yahooz> and dare I say SeaNanners
<DoctoDoctorWho> Buytoast: I've never heard of the guy, so I cant agree that its truth
<Colt_Brovakiin> DashWithRainbows: I love Robbaz :3
<DashWithRainbows> Good boy.
<AJIsAwesome_> Your so-called "truth" is nothing but an opinion. I don't believe you. Elaborate.
<LunasGuard> ello Dken2021 Colt_Brovakiin cachi01
<otakon17> Sumica: Know what won for lottery man?
<DoctoDoctorWho> hai LunasGuard
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon17: surprisingly, yes. when i tried it for B, they said it was A
<otakon17> twilight_sprinkle: Woah
<Yahooz> otakon17: check the site page
<otakon17> Yahooz: Okay
<Buytoast> he's basically some unfunny leech that hates any game other than ocarina of time and praises old games and hate new
<LunasGuard> and the good ol DoctoDoctorWho
<otakon17> Welp I'm out for now
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, otakon17. :)
<Bronysith> otakon17: that was fast

<Yahooz> its not on there
<Yahooz> yet
<otakon17> Oh
<otakon17> Dammit
<cachi01> Buytoast: implying new games are good
<DashWithRainbows> Now that is what I call a wall hack.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Buytoast, who?
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350168928512.png dat cuteness
<cachi01> well we have esceptions
<Buytoast> jontron
<cachi01> exceptions*
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: he might just review games he doesnt like, a lot of people do
<Cameh_Dude> whats the name of the server?
<Dken2021> cachi01 you mean they aren't D:?
<Jesse_> DON'T DIE
<Jesse_> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<[SWAG]Haku> So guys, I dont want to boast or anything, but I just broke my record for number of days without dying
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350168531195.jpg
<cachi01> Dken2021: we have some exceptions
<zacksters> hai guys
<Ryunosuke> awoxer?
<Jesse_> What game is this called again?
<AdamTheDuck> Hello zacksters
<Dken2021> lali-ho zacksters
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai zacksters
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: ....
<cachi01> Bronysith: you really like linking that leech right?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, zacksters. :)
<AdamTheDuck> Cameh_Dude, I would like to know as well >.<
<Buytoast> if only i could find that video
<DoctoDoctorWho> LunasGuard: is that a good thing or a bad thing?
<Bromany> planetside 2 (?)
<Buytoast> it;'s bascailly him saying how sonic and metroid prime were terrible, overrated games
<Ryunosuke> ya
<DoctoDoctorWho> you never know
<Buytoast> among others
<Buytoast> and by sonic i mean the first sonic
<LunasGuard> DoctoDoctorWho: its good :)
<zacksters> D:
<Cameh_Dude> i was rainbow dashie but i must have been on a different server 6_9
<DoctoDoctorWho> LunasGuard: yay, hail celestia:)
<Jesse_> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: but i thought you said he liked the old games and hates the new ones
<LunasGuard> DoctoDoctorWho: luna is only one I hail to
<Buytoast> he praises ocarina of time
<Buytoast> but he doesn't like all old games
<Buytoast> he just think's they're superior
<Buytoast> and i found the video
<Jesse_> Who praises what?
<mitamaking> So what is up?
<AJIsAwesome> Nothing much.
<AJIsAwesome> Just Wrek playing PS2.
<[SWAG]Haku> PS2?
<mitamaking> Still read that as Phantasy Star
<Buytoast> oh god
<AJIsAwesome> Planetside 2.
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont really care about ol dgames, or many new games. i just think hes funny, and he seems like an ok guy
<Buytoast> i forgot some of the ones he hates
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<mitamaking> Or Playstation
<twilight_sprinkle> *old
<DoctoDoctorWho> LunasGuard: I care not how many traitors invade the internet, I will stand tall by the sun goddess's side.
<DoctoDoctorWho> :)
<Buytoast> jontron believes brawl is the best super smash brothers
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same.
<Jesse_> For the New Lunar Republic!
<Buytoast> because it's the newest one
<mitamaking> Buytoast: I agree
<Dken2021> Buytoast ...so far
<mitamaking> It has the most characters, the most modes, and I like the play style
<LunasGuard> DoctoDoctorWho: u do that /me fly away
<Iwa> Buytoast: As much as I would like to agree...melee was better
*LunasGuard fly away
<Buytoast> no it's not
<mitamaking> Now SSBW(World is my guess for the next one) will likely be better
<[SWAG]Haku> my iPod just died :(
<Buytoast> it's not the newst
<Buytoast> so it's bad
<Dken2021> It's been awhile since i played melee
<[SWAG]Haku> I MUST GIVE IT CPR!!
<DoctoDoctorWho> The NLR will be crushed under the might of the solar empire, and luna apprehended for her heresy.
<mitamaking> Buytoast: huh?
<AJIsAwesome> If only Melee was compayible with LAN.
*Bronysith lickels [SWAG]Haku
<Iwa> Buytoast: *hipster glasses*
<Buytoast> that's jontron's argument
<[SWAG]Haku> ...
<mitamaking> What is wrong with 4 player Melee?
<[SWAG]Haku> Bronystih
<[SWAG]Haku> WHy woudl you lcik me?
<Buytoast> it's not the newest one
<mitamaking> Brawl is the newest one
<Bronysith> [SWAG]Haku: you taste of strawberries and chocolate
<Buytoast> oh, and he hates metroid prime because it's "too open world"
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts Bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> Is this a Game Grumps video or JonTron video?
<[SWAG]Haku> weird, I dislike strawberryies
<Buytoast> jontron
<Buytoast> one he deleted because he realized how wrong he was
<mitamaking> I am not a fan of Metroid Prime either, but I recognize the game for what it is
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Buytoast> and tried to do some damage control
<Iwa> <-- Getting increasingly skeptical wether Buytoast is sarcastic
<cachi01> Buytoast: well he hates new stuff who dafuq cares? everyone has their opinions
<superretroworld> i suddenly got addicted to jontron now
<cachi01> ^
<[SWAG]Haku> Bad Horse is only horse Haku knows of
<[SWAG]Haku> Ponies do not count because they are ponies and not horses
<sonicdude558> dat Twi Plushie
<twilight_sprinkle> jontron is pretty hilarious, although his humor can get old pretty fast if you watch too much of his stuff
<Buytoast> let's see, i forgot what the 2 most ovverated games are to him
<CCCP> hi
<Buytoast> oh
<sonicdude558> hello CCCP
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: That is my opinion of Zero Punctuation
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai CCCP :)
*LunasGuard lands on cloud
<DoctoDoctorWho> [SWAG]Haku: I think horse is a derogatory term for ponies
<Buytoast> Goldeneye and Link to the Past
<CCCP> hi sonicdude558 Colt_Brovakiin
<Buytoast> well then
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CCCP. :)
<mitamaking> Goldeneye is overrated
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: never heard of him
<[SWAG]Haku> Shut up DDW
<CCCP> hi AJIsAwesome
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai CCCP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wow. I quieted Bronysith.
<CCCP> hi twilight_sprinkle
<cachi01> Buytoast: everyone has their fucking opinions. and yes goldeneye is overrated
<Dken2021> eh, I don't mind Jontron, but since he's a "internet reviewer" I don't tune into him that much
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: What? How? Teach me of this power!
<Buytoast> i believe all his goldeneye bashing is about the multiplayer
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai CCCP
<AJIsAwesome> Goldeneye, DEFINITELY overrated. Link To The Past, not so much.
<CCCP> hello AdamTheDuck
<Bromany> perfect dark was nice
<[SWAG]Haku> Goldeneye is as overated as The Lion King
<Dken2021> ello CCCP
<CCCP> hi Dken2021
<Buytoast> oh god, this is too funny
<Buytoast> "Why is Goldeneye bad?"
<mitamaking> Link to the Past is a little overrated, but only because people worship it as the GOAT
<Buytoast> "Because it's old."
<CCCP> id much rather it be christmas time than halloween
<Jesse_> Golden eye wasn't that bad.
<spud363> what game is this?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't know if you can handle it GilDash.
<Buytoast> man, jontron is such an enlightening and interesting fellow
<cachi01> a legend of zelda cant be overrated because they are already 10000000000000000% awesome.....well except for 3 games..................
<AJIsAwesome> Planetside 2.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Tsk, try me. ;)
<[SWAG]Haku> Dark CLoud?
<Colt_Brovakiin> CCCP: I know right :P
<Ponies47> I wish I had Planetside 2 :/
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Yahooz> GilDash: but "that would be telling :p"
<mitamaking> Goldeneye had bad graphics for the N64 if you ask me, bad controls, and really the multiplayer is overrated
*CCCP hugs Colt_Brovakiin
<LunasGuard> watching two streams at a time :D
<Iwa> cachi01: Out of curiousity: Which?
<Bromany> i'm going to bed
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Bromany. :)
<Bromany> have a good night everypony
<spud363> night
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Bromany
<cachi01> Iwa: zelda adventures, faces of evil and i forgot the name of the other shitty cdi game
<superretroworld> night Bromany
<Buytoast> man, the jontron worship brigade is out in full force
<Buytoast> what a shame
<mitamaking> LttP, really I don't care for it, but I am not a up-down view of Zelda fan
<Dken2021> night Bromany, have fun in a dormant state for 8 hours
<Colt_Brovakiin> Same here, this game looks awesome and my laptop is to shit to run anything :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: Eat lots of grapes. You can't lose.
<GilDash> Yahooz: Shut up, you. :p
<mitamaking> I don't even watch Jontron, I just agree with him on Goldeneye
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Grapes? Can't I just drink grape juice?
<spud363> what couler are they?
<Jesse_> I only eat Green Grapes.
<spud363> typo
<Jesse_> If they're Purple forget it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Grape juice works, but you'll only get 80% of the power you need.
<cachi01> Colt_Brovakiin: if it cant run doom. then yes u r probably fucked
<mitamaking> boom
<Buytoast> "Man, I need an opinion on something. I know! I'll agree with whatever JonTron says. I am so enlightened now."
<mitamaking> what?
<cachi01> ^
<[SWAG]Haku> Haku must take his leave now everypony
*DoctoDoctorWho is sad
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, [SWAG]Haku. :)
<mitamaking> I don't even watch Jontron
<cachi01> bye [SWAG]Haku :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye [SWAG]Haku
<[SWAG]Haku> Good night, good morning, good evening
<CCCP> bye [SWAG]Haku
<AdamTheDuck> Bye [SWAG]Haku
<Dken2021> nice seeing you [SWAG]Haku
<Saigneur> bye [SWAG]Haku
<sonicdude558> I just had a power flicker :(
<Panda> I come back to talk of grapes? Nittany_Discord, GilDash, what?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: That's okay. I can eat the rest.
<Jesse_> This game has some pretty smexy graphics I must say
<GilDash> Panda: Oh, Holla! :)
<cachi01> ERHMAGERD GREIPS R MAH FAEVRITE
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai Panda :)
<mitamaking> This game looks like what Battlefield 3 promised to be
<sonicdude558> dat joystick
<sonicdude558> then buffer
<Conyst> hello agaim panda
<mitamaking> Blue Angel designs
<cachi01> mfw when battlefield 4 releases next year :/
<Conyst> again*
*Panda waves
<Fearless> Your so "Wrek-less"
<DoctoDoctorWho> Declination of stream is saddening...
<Jesse_> That airship makes me moist
<AJIsAwesome> As entertaining as JonTron can be, there is no way that I agree with him on everything. Take Bubsy, for example. He hated the game. I loved it as a kid and I still do.
<Colt_Brovakiin> o.o
<AJIsAwesome> Well, the SNES one.
<mitamaking> Isn't Bubsy that cat thingy?
<AJIsAwesome> Not the PS1 version. :D
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Yep.
<sonicdude558> NO NOT THAT BOBCAT
<Jesse_> ALL OF THE MUSCLES
<sonicdude558> I WILL KILL IT WITH MY BARE HANDS
<mitamaking> It looked so weird
<cachi01> FROOOOOOOOOOOGGY
<mitamaking> cachi01: Big the cat?
<Jesse_> Why is that Twilight Plush sitting there next to him the entire time!? XD
<cachi01> YEEEES EVERYTIME I HERA CAT I THINK OF THAT BASTARD
<mitamaking> Jesse_: After game privliges
<AJIsAwesome> Jesse_: Because he likes Twilight?
<cachi01> hear*
<sonicdude558> I wuv Twiley :)
<Jesse_> I can't buy a plush they all so damn expensive
<DoctoDoctorWho> sad sad sad sad sad sad
<mitamaking> Do you have a eject button?
<AJIsAwesome> Jesse_: I know that feeling.
<sonicdude558> me neither Jesse_, they are like $200 - 300 :(
<Ryunosuke> dafuq wrek
<cachi01> GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
<Dken2021> so...anyone up for a battle in pokemon?
<Jesse_> I know :(
<cachi01> GIMME 20 DOLLAHS
<cachi01> NO WIFFIN IN DA CLUB
<mitamaking> Dken2021: White 2 or Black 2?
<Eli> i srly don't get the hype in TF2 about hats... i just pulled one out of a crate, and i freaking hate it. could have been a strange weapon, but noooo... a hat
<sonicdude558> cachi01: GIMMIE 200 DOLLAHS
<Dken2021> mitamaking black 2
<Jesse_> In order to get a plushie..I need....I need...I need about Tree Fitty
<mitamaking> Dken2021: *brohoof*
<BronyInstrumental> Tree Fiddy
<sonicdude558> ? Jesse_ ?
<Dken2021> mitamaking /)
<Dken2021> dang loch ness monster
<Jesse_> I need about Tree fiddy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Eli: one does not simply question the hats
<mitamaking> If I had internet I would
<Eli> DoctoDoctorWho: i hate hats. except for my own. that one's cool
<Dken2021> oh, ok then
<cachi01> Eli: MAY I TAKE YOUR HAT SIR?
<sonicdude558> God... I can't take my eyes off that plushie
<mitamaking> I play some TF2 and I don't get the hats either, then again, pokemon fan
<Eli> cachi01: well if you give me something for it, sure
<Jesse_> That plushie makes me want to jump through my monitor into his room and steal the plushie
<cachi01> Eli: i will give you my pride
<Jesse_> But I'm not Pinkie Pie I don't possess those powers.
<sonicdude558> me too Jesse_
<cachi01> caus el shitbos wont run TF2
<cachi01> shitbox*
<Eli> cachi01: eww. i don't want that
<AJIsAwesome> Aren't most hats just cosmetic? I know you can combine some of them with other apparel and get special benefits, but not for every kind of hat.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Somepony should make a tf2 parody using fullmetal alchemist
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: do you have TF2 now?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
*sonicdude558 breaks the 4th wall, follows Wrek's IP adress, goes through his monitor and grabs his Twi plushie and gives it to Jesse_
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: aww...
<Jesse_> Yeeeeh!
<Jesse_> I'm going to have so many adventures with Twilight.
<mitamaking> DoctoDoctorWho: I guarentee it has been done
<cachi01> Jesse_: but the plushie is still with Wrek so sonicdude558's adventure to get twilight is not canon
<Jesse_> NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<sonicdude558> yo but I used a clone machine :3
<Jesse_> YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
<Ryunosuke> 1.21 GIGAWATTS!
<mitamaking> More twillights for everypony
<Eli> cachi01: do you have TF? i don't think i have you yet
<Dken2021> yay
<cachi01> guys. any cool doom wads you recommend me?
<Jesse_> My school has a 3d Printer XD
<Cranberry_Scotch> It's a shame that that PPG/MLP fic is on hiatus
<cachi01> Eli: my steam is cachisebas. if not its cachi01
<Ryunosuke> NOT THE $TH WALL
<Ryunosuke> 4TH
<sonicdude558> That is epic Jesse_
<sonicdude558> I would spam codes to it
<sonicdude558> :D
<cachi01> Eli: but el shitbox wont run tf2 so pls wait a month till i get my new pc and we will play :)
<Dken2021> cachi01 there was a christmas one I know of, but last time I check, the guy that made it doesn't know that the link is gone
<mitamaking> The 4TH wall is the money wall when it comes to Pinkie
<Jesse_> I would make a plastic Twilight form then paint it XD

<AJIsAwesome> ..........
<Dark92Enigma> What can I say about this one? The animation is fantastic, the soundtrack is awesome, and the story, while engaging and action packed, can drag for too long at times,As for the characters, they’re overall good, and spot-on like the show. but for me, the one who stole the show is Mojo-Jojo. My God is he a tragic character….a good one. You can’t help but empathize with him, even if we know he’s going to be the villain. But then again, that

<DerpyMuffins> You two have plans together Allegr0?
<Canadian_Brony> FUUUTUUURRRRE
<Cypresswolf> :D That was worth staying in tonight
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Dark92Enigma> So how does this movie hold up? Personally, I say it holds up very well, and I’m not saying this because I love the show, but for how dark, serious, and intense it was. I guess it’s biggest crime was dragging for too long, like an extended episode instead of a movie. Not to mention it gets a little predictable if you’ve grown up with the show (since you might’ve knew what was coming), or too aggressive, dark and violent if you haven’t.
<MaxTheBrony> Woah much text
<MaxTheBrony> Why is there so much text?
<DerpyMuffins> Dat text wall
