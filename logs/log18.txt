fbhsjkdlpe
rrwejiodfpr
So does it even matter which one is better?
03Lakorv, how is that a fact?
and Lakorv, lol
03One server having a better uptime than another is a fact
that's kinda the point he's makin
g
Come back when your server has uptime of 10 years
03saying something is stupid is an opinion
=p
!umbreon
same <censored>
o/` Another one bites the dust, oh - another onebites the dust! o/`
03well if you say it that way
LMAO
03then that woudld be true
OKAY
OMG

LAKORV
SUCKS IS NOT A SWEAR

BUT THAT
10Sigh. All you guys never do anything but fight eachother.

Frak
03sure looked like it to me
lakorv is one of the most calm people I know.
Why isn't frak censored?

No, frak
FRAK
xD
Oh
by the way
Frak means fuc-
staeld@tahn ~ $ uptime 07:46:36 up 47 days, 6:09
/me shot
LOL
that is my bouncer.
so who had the better server?
03bouncers != server
03s
Bounce.
uh
a bouncer runs off a server
LOL
03but in that case yes your machine has a better uptime than mine
03but I'm talking about nest here.
03that thing was hosted on a Windows machine connected using wifi
03would go down like twice a week LOL
I'm still listening to Nyan Cat
No...
...
it's running just fine.
it was-
LOL
03Arti herself said it was hosted using wireless
I always used Ocean because it was stated to be better
I love Lakorv
Someone give Arti money to buy a Linux box with wired connections
seriously
rio
I thought Arti herself said Ocean was better xD
03she did
lol.
03:P
Rio
With Intel Xeon processors
Other window for a min please?
16 GB of RAM
03LOL WTF Xeon
server-grade fans
03why Xeon?
Other window? o.o
the skype chat
03I could build Arti a server... but why would I want to?
I'll explain something to you
03I already offered to let Arti take ownership of the server I bought that runs island
03so >_>
Because you would lose dictatorship of TST?
03no>?
03kindly explain how I have a dictatorship when I don't abuse my power?
Hmmm.
03the only times I even use /kill is if someone asks me to
You ew too much
That is all
03like clones that aren't registered so they can't ghost them
anyway
he could, but he doesn't.
03implying I can't do that on any ordinary server I'm not in charge of o_O
Look! 5th gen Pokémon and Apple products!
oho lol
You ew too much. Back to you
03you just said the same thing again
03I could repeat myself too but that's lame
That is MY point
03How does me ew'ing stuff have ANYTHING to do with my running a server?
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
You make people uninvited.
That.
!ew everything
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW EVERYTHING
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
You make people leave TST
03as for that, that's you triggering my script -_-
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
You make people leave TST
03which, again, brings me back to my point of HOW DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME HOSTING A SERVER
Because
IF YOU ARE NOT AROUND PEOPLE WILL COME BACK AS THERE'S NO ONE EWWING.
03.....
i will
03me not having a server != me not being here
Sorry I don't make sense right now because nyan cat.
But you having a server here = you must be here
03there are also people who have left because of too much spamming (read: script abuse)
03so you're no better than I am.
...
03Everyone is childish in their own ways. Can we agree to that?
03I'm here by choice.
03off to bed
derp
/me hugs Drake
Okay, bye!
04hi
/me hugs back
04Your like my friend at school
04she comes up to me and randomly hugs me.
04And gets angry at me when I don't hug back,.
04She's also like, 2 feet shorter than me. It's amusing.
._.
she gets angry
because of that?
also I passed my Amus @ Drake
and on another random note
04Awesome
I honestly don't get what's it so much about osama
I mean tbqh
04Who now?
/me shot
I don't understand all the hate
but you know me
I'm kinda fucked up
>reminiscence
>TCTL
04I hated him for what he's done, but I'm not exactly celebrating.
04It's death.
why do you hate him for what he's done?
I'm sorry but I fail to understand why people hate terrorism :x
04Because people die
lolwut.
04That's one simple thing.
:(
What the <censored> was that.
I'm fucked up
so tbqh I don't see murder/assassinations/shit as wrong
but yeah, you know that I'm like that
:x
lol the crap that just went on. mfw.
04I understand because they're stories, and they're just that - stories - but when people die in real life, you need to look at it from a different perspective.
04Neither of us have actually seen someone die in front of our eyes, so we don't know what it's like.
I have
hm
that's possibly true
and I know some things disgust me
but that doesn't make those things wrong
04To me, killing is wrong. Pure and simple.
04You may kill someone to make life better for others, but that doesn't mean it's "right"
04I know that there's no 'right and wrong' in the world, but that's my right and wrong.
I never said it was right
I just said it wasn't wrong either
personally, I don't really believe there's that much of a "right" and "wrong" with things
I think that "right" and "wrong" depends on what the person themselves think
04That's what I'm saying...sort of.
so if they think that killing is right/wrong, then it is, for them at least
it's all opinion really
04Yes
but then I hate people who try to force their opinion on others.
now that's just retarded.
Anyway
bbl dinner
04k
starving and I want to eat food
/me hugs Drake and poofs
04XD
04I can eat it at my desk
04it's awesome
EWWWWWWWWW
Choices are:-
Sexual health
Drugs & binge drinking
Parent-teen communication
Internet safety/getting home safely/safe partying
Eating & diet
Depression
seminar SHIT
What should I do?
04wait what
we have a seminar thing at school next week
04What is this?
and we have to select what topic
those are the topics
04oh
what should I do?
04um
sexual health?
so I can do it with you later
/me hides
04Do sexual health, depression or that internet crap
04XD
>internet safety
my ass
when they try to teach me about "not getting corrupted"
04loooool
mfw I'm already corrupted, fuckers
04They're a bit late much?
SUCK ON IT
derp
2 years too late
might do that just for the lulz
04Nah
04do sexual health
but it'd be boring
yeah
04"Impress" them
I'll do sexual health
lmaaaaaaaao
wonder if they'll make us put condoms on bananas
we're going to be doing that during class though
04We never did that in PDHP
but what the fuck
why do we need to learn
how to put condoms on penises?
we're fucking girls
don't have penises
04XD
04It's kind of straightforward anyway
are our husbands retarded enough to NOT know how to put on a condom?
or at least admit they don't
04Unless there's this weird mechanic it has just to make it difficult
04XD
deeeeeeerp
anyway
dinner
mum's yelling etc.
/me poofs
04k
04cya
needs moar espeon awake
o_O
...you need a better connection :x
/me hugs Drake again
/me hugs back
04wb
thanks
but yeah
you do have to remember that I'm pretty fucked up, Drake
hell, I spend my free time daydreaming ;x
04...Another thing we share in common
derp
04except it's not my 'free' time I spend daydreaming
04I daydream all the time
I hope that you're not as fucked up as me
okay
that's true
I do too
XD
04I doubt I'm that much like you.
of course
else you'd be retarded
04XD
but yes
Reminiscence and TCTL are basically results of daydreams + philosophies
So pretty much what I have my characters say in them are what I believe
04I figured
derp
Reminiscence's key theme is freedom
TCTL's is right and wrong
and also evil/good
04Alot of my stories relay my feelings and opinions.
although personally, I don't believe in evil
yeah
04DoI is about how you should have your own thoughts and opinions.
04CoE is more about how you shouldn't let beuocracy/politics or religion rule you.
04beurocracy*
lol politics.
lol religion.
heh
DoI is somewhat similar to Reminiscence then
and CoE is more like TCTL
04There are other underlying themes, but those two are the main ones.
derp
although
tbqh
TCTL has a shitload of themes
the main ones are right and wrong/good and bad
but there's also stuff like limits and imagination
not sure if you even read it/noticed it
but derp
04I read it sometimes.
04Hmm
04The prequel to DoI doesn't really have a theme now that I think about it
heh
tbqh I still like TMoaTB
TMoaTB's theme is something like
04What would it's theme be anyway?
loyalty and independence or something
and such
and loyalty/friendship
etc.
04eh
04maybe
04never put too much thought into TMoaTB
what do you think Reminiscence's theme is? lol
wttttttttttttttf
04Freedom, how the world is grey, not black and white, loyalty, friendship, underlying hints of love between friends and colleagues.
fix your bloody connection
love
lolwut
04I'm getting a real nakama sense between Seran and the DM's, the Kommander and The Hensh
04not love as in lovey-dovey
04but a close bond
lmao
Seran, the DMs, Kommander Kulesz and The Hensh are pretty close, yeah
and that pretty much sums it what
up*
what do you think about TCTL, then?
-_-
04From what I've read...eh, black/white again, your own opinions on right/wrong, and how complex people are and that you can't take them for face value.
04eX dies alot.
derp
well
04Rathicus and Dragoran are very complex. You also seem to enjoy having a stern but understanding leader + a sarcastic second-in-command.
TCTL is more black/white than Reminiscence
derp
Dragoran isn't really sarcastic
04Rathicus and Dragoran = The Kommander and the Hensh
lmao
Dragoran is more...playful and joking around
he's not the serious type of guy
04Also
04Does it make sense for someone who takes alot of things literally (such as idioms and sarcastic comments) to be sarcastic himself?
sort of
he does get offended easily, amirite?
and he's not like The Hensh, right?
04Sort of.
is he like the Hensh?
04Only when about topics he doesn't understand (such as, everything)
04No, not that level
04He's not constantly sarcastic
oic
well The Hensh isn't always sarcastic
derp
he's just impossible
04Basically, he was raised to have no frickin' idea about regular life and stuff.
seriously
ah
well then that sort of makes sense
not really
XD
04He's basically a living weapon with alot of poetic skill.
ooookay
04I make my characters too sarcastic
do you mean "get offended/take it seriously"
when you say "literally"
I just disconnected
:x
04Not 'get offended', like the phrase "It's raining cats and dogs" he'll go "No it's not, it's just water."
and nah
it takes quite a lot to get me mad
Drake knows that
04Yep
Ah
04Although noobs get on her nerves.
04So very much.
04Keep them away.
well
it doesn't really make that much sense
but it could
if his personality is like that
04hmm
04I'll put it into his character when he gets older then
lol lag much
04Because by then he'll know alot more and he'll be more comfortable.
derp
but like
Rathicus is sort of like Kommander Kulesz I guess
but Dragoran isn't really like The Hensh
Dragoran isn't sarcastic
There's also a third person along with Rathicus and Dragoran though (not Syril)
She's revealed in chapter 9
one damn psycho bitch
reminds me of Arcane
:x
:x
04what's with the ':x
I was so retarded back then
it wasn't even funny
04we all were
you weren't so much
I was
04I kind of was
not as much as me
04I tried too hard
eh we all did
04almost like HML
04almost
lol HML
04not as bad
was*
12o-O
/me dies
04UMBREON
ohai Umbreon
12hi..
04GO REPLY TO MY POST IN THE COMPETITION TOPIC ON HOR DAMMIT
04also hi
/me hugs
/me hugs too
but Drake
/me lies on Umbreon
but I'm lazy Umbreon D:
04lol
12but you two are made for eachother
04NS I was just wondering what happened to her. You never use her for anything.
why would I?
04No one's denying that Bree
lmao
the only character I've really kept over the years
04I dunno
is Seran
12o-O because drake will get really sad if you don't
so are we umbreon~
because of Reminiscence
04I have
12hi Nova
Xale not really
04Irres less so
Rex.
04XD
04Except even moar mysterious
And Rex is all like "fuck off, all you idiots, I'll kick your ass"
/me licks umbreons cheek
Leonard is great though
I love Xeli's char
04Leonard is awesome
he'd just be like "And your point is?"
And Seran is...Seran.
Kommander Kulesz
Dunno what you think of him
04he fucking uses a tree in a pole-vault manouever in mid-air
lmao
I remember that
12eep
04He's like Chuck Norris on steroids.
lmao
04KK is a pretty cool guy
eh doesn't afraid of anything
04We don't see much of him though
really?
04lolthat was my intention XD
lmao
04Yeah...we don't know much about his motives other than that they're better than you'd think
his motives aren't really clear until you read the prequel
04exactly
04It's frustrating
lmao
04We don't know what he, or by extension the rest of TD, are really fighting for.
And well
derp
I'll explain that later
in the fic
and lol
coming to...THE HENSH.
04THE HENSH
9,1THE HENSH
04"Cower in fear O' yee mortals! The time of reckoning has come!"
lmao
then Rex says something.
and then The Hensh is like
04"GUN IM DOWN
xD
04I wonder who would win in a debate
I love how he makes the DMs bawwwww
04HMM
LOL
Let's write that
LET'S DO IT.
04XD
04LET'S DO EET
I'll write KK
04right after I finish this drawing
fine
04Gotta do this for some friends at school
ah
04they need two of my characters to model
lol.
ah
well like
lmao
and Rathicus vs Lyon
or KK
04Nah
actually
04The Hensh vs Espen
04now THAT would be awesome
Espen?
04That guy I was talking about
04the one who rapes people and then tells his bastard son about it while smiling.
the sarcastic/mentally retard-
OH
OKAY
04and who is psychic
04and awesome
COMMENCE THE MIND GAMES.
Rathicus vs Espen
04XD
HURP DURP.
actually that'd be no fun
04why?
because Rathicus would be like "you're evil, cool, i like you"
12!Pokemom
12!Pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 13Terrakion.
04But Espen's not evil
well
04He's just a complete monster
not evil
I mean
psychotic
04and a jerkass
yeah but Rathicus is like
KK + Leonard
;x
The Hensh vs Espen would be best though
/me awesomeface
whatever
and then Seiranyu vs Lyon...bitchslapplz
04XD
but heh
04dammit

12ahh
12there has to be a way to disclude that channel
06Yeah, but I just haven't bothered doing so yet :P
12at the very least it shouldn't be too hard to set a script to auto varreset like 5 seconds after connecting
06Or just if espynick is Global then varset

Can't remember

04But it's too complex
04Maybe a mirror...or a wolf
04eX has been dying alot tonight
04Do you have the Witch Hunt DLC for Dragon Age?
Yep
04What does the Eluvian mirror look like?
06.-.

12stats are boring
Statfat
Yeah
12?
12sorry got to do it right
lol
derp
12?
jesus
crappy connection is crappy
:x
12you're welcome
derp
Hurr
AFK
ok
jesus
someone
seriously needs to explain to me
why osama bin laden is hated
o-o
12what D:
12k
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 3Rufflet.
Back
12wb
Thanks
wb
ty etc
because seriously, he can't be that bad lol
killing != end of the world
though it could very well be lol
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 10Swoobat.
okay but just ignore me
I'm extremely fcked up etc.
12it's a topic i refuse to get into
I'll probably grow up to be a terrorist too /sarcasm
no but seriously
I don't understand
12google it
I read something that said australians wouldn't really understand until planes crashed into the opera house etc.
but tbqh I wouldn't give a damn.
actually I'd probably be like "yay" because that thing is retarded
12how would you feel if planes crashed into Drake's house?
trying to imagine that.
if he doesn't die I'd be okay with it I guess
if he does die...idk
12exactly, a lot of people have killed but he killed tons of people
12and when people lose someone very special to them, it gets personal
I see
ah
right
well
I'd probably bawwwwwww all over it for a while
but I wouldn't hold an overall grudge
but then again, there's no one IRL that I care for enough for that
besides Hensh and Drake
12drake probably isn't even that close of a relationship either
true
12people lost family members in 9/11
the only person I'd consider somewhat close would be the Hensh
eh family members
12mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters
care cup is empty
I care for my friends
>family
okay, bye
12okay ike
I've never been particularly close to my family fyi :x
12i don't think words exist to explain how drastically that can change when a life theatening emergency happens
12anyway like i said before, it's not a situation i want to get much into
eh tbqh I've been waiting for that
derp
well
I'm not exactly the most caring person on the planet lol
in fact, I'm probably quite far from that
:x
12i'm just going to say this to be funny
12but how would you feel if a plane crashed into your house, and you were inside
hm
let me think
would I have enough time to be like "holy crap" or something?
aka would the plane kill me? derp
12you'd probably have like a 5% chance at surviving for more than 5 seconds lol
then I probably wouldn't feel anything
12i had a feeling you'd say that
pretty much
but derp
I'm like, one of those people/as*holes who basically think that everyone should fend for themselves
12kind of hard to do that when you're buried under 20 feet of destroyed building
12with no pulse
I don't feel sorry for people that much lol
well, of course, being dead, you can't fend for yourself
but while you're alive
you can
even if you physically can't
g2g
seeya
12you seem to me like someone who has never felt true grief
you could say that maybe? idk
I remember feeling grief
but that hasn't been for several years :x
12from what?
12mcdonalds forgetting cheese on your burger?
lmao
I'd just call them retards
12XD
lmaaaaaaaao
but well
see, I've had a rather rocky past
I've been bullied, hit, hurt, etc. by everyone around me
I stopped caring about them
12and you have no one to help
12*had
I stopped caring about everyone else
pretty much
12not everyone was raised like that
I know
but that's probably most of what caused me to be like this
you know, uncaring, unfeeling...cold
indifferent
12you have sort of gotten into the habit of relying on yourself, but some people literally use other people like crutches
I've noticed
12and when those crutches are exterminated
Exterminating
Watr
-r
well
I can understand that
12exterminating water?
12what are you adam west?
lmao
Yes, exterminating it with heat
Since I'm so hot ;3
/me shot
12you aren't exterminating it with heat
but well, I had no one to turn to for 13 years
12only evaporating it
it's only now that I even have someone to turn to IRL
who possibly understands me slightly
but
12you should open up more :)
it's people like all you
who I care about
...such a shame there aren't that many to open up to
12then be less strict with who you give information to
Sounds like some depressed, closeted, freak
Oh wait
12i'm not saying give your passwords to people but lol
12all i can really say is old habits die hard
lmao HML
and yes that's true
is opening up to all you not enough? lmao
;p
but derp, I have actually opened up more in the past year or so
at least after my breakdown in the middle of the year last year
12when you open up more, people start to understand you more.
not everyone.
and lol
12exceptions are everywhere
I don't want people feeling sorry for me
12that should be obvious
obviously derp
well
I've tried to open up
have people understood me more? no
they've only gone around going "awwwww"
12because you haven't talked to the right people lol
well derp
12and in case you think you failed, you didn't lol
uh lol
I don't want people feeling sorry for me
and nearly every time I've trusted someone and opened up
they've gone around spreading it f*cking everywhere
which is even worse
12Thomas Edison failed more than 1,000 times when
12trying to create the light bulb". (The story is often told as 5,000
12or 10,000 times depending on the version.) When asked about it,
12Edison allegedly said, "I have not failed 1,000 times. I have
12successfully discovered 1,000 ways to NOT make a light bulb."
lol HML, there's no care bear anywhere near me

12lol
that quote actually makes sense to me :/
12psychology is usually tricky

12but sometimes it almost makes perfect sense to me

hm, what do you mean? Physics?

12what?
Hell is other people.
Jean-Paul Sartre
hell yeah, depressing quotes ftw
hm, i mean that part that interested you in years, do you mean Physics or Science with it?
eh?
psychology != physics/science
AH
i see :P
psychology is the study of the mind or something
or human brain
I forgot
my bad, and i know
and tbqh
Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.
i thought Umbre meant something completely different, referring to the Edison Quote
Jean-Paul Sartre

Sartre and Voltaire are awesome philosophers
Sartre support terrorism at one point iirc...one of his quotes was something like "Terrorism is a terrible weapon but it is the only one that the oppressed poor have."

I found one of those old 20 in 1 pirate game boy games
it had the first 3 pokemon games on it xD
wow, did it contain anything interesting?
as well as game and watch (which I've played for the first time there xD)
Nick I used to have one of those

what was the difference with green and the US red blue versions

03OK
03here's what happened
03it was originally Red and Green in Japan, right
03they had godugly sprites

03<Nick> drf you talking about what we were? the new mlp show thing? <- yeah
so you've watched it? WTH is it about? whats the appeal cos Like I've seen old men draw fan art for it
Nick, 4chan is the reason behind mlp being oh-so-popular
03no I haven't
in a nutshell
03I refuse to watch it for that reason
ah right
03generally speaking, if something is uber popular, it sucks
03and there are very few exceptions to that
/me runs
it sucks to people like us who like to feel self-righteous about not being into what everyone else is into :33c
03more or less
03I mean, stuff like Windows that everyone uses, yes those are good :P
well I'm sort of the opposite, if there's something I like, I want to see it do well
03but I try to avoid super popular products
03ah well
03if I like something, and then it becomes popular, that's fine
03but I don't want to start liking something because everyone else does
yeah i like things if they have merit to be liked, not "hay evryone plyas it"
03^
03LOL fail, I accidentally called a FAX number
13I wasn't expecting to like MLP, heck I don't even know what I like about it |D
13I just wanted to know wtf made it so damn popular
13But meh, I'm not addicted/obsessed or anything, I just like it
same here angel espy
13xD
;o
anyway about MLP I read on that old 80's cartoon site that the original pilot MLP mini movie special thing, was actually REALLY dark apparantly
13o-o
for like you know, a show aimed a girls with brightly oversaturated ponies living in a land of makeup candy and sunny hill valley rainbow lands :D
13Lol I hated the original
13|D
13Anyway, dinner
but yeah, this was like a one of for the original series cos after that it did get toned down, but in the pilot, demons riding dragons would kidnap ponies, take them to a spooky castle with a satanic looking overlord who used some bag full of dark magic to transform the ponies into more dragons and demons to serve this dark lord
he even threatened to behead spike the dragon xD I'm dead serious
/me sets mode: +cookie Nick
wait what that do to me?
03Just watch an episode or two if you're actually interested
03Or at least want to know what the fuss was about
03since that what I did
03I just saw it was so popular
03and wondered why on earth people would like MY LITTLE PONY, of all the shows
03then I watched it
03and became brainwashed
lol
which one the new one?
I watched the first ep
I liked
03Yeah
I never watched again
03Friendship is Magic

Confusing you
7Oh, I'm insinuating what the song is without actually saying it.
portal related?
7No, actually.

How are you?
annoyed
D:
why?
my dad just came in my room and told me he's shutting off the internet at 12
O.o
why is he doing that?
Because "that's just what I'd like in my house"
I'd be annoyed too
that's ridiculous, it hasn't been like that for you in forever
sorry if it isn't my place to say
why would it not be your place to say?
I was literally just complaining about it
I dunno, just because he isn't my dad is all
so does that mean he's gonna do that every night this summer?
sounds like it
:(
>_>
when did you find this out from him?
just now
no reason or anything
just because he wants to
huh, that's weird

So... was there a clandestine discussion going on here that stopped upon my entry, or am I being paranoid?
there was a conversation, but I don't think your entry was what stopped it

04Wait
04I wrote a short story today
o_o
04about Rhy, Nathan and Leo at Movieworld
...lol
I think Rhy would just complain
"what better way to have fun than visit Movie World near the Gold Cost for the day?"
Cost
lol
"debate all the philosophical and moral reasons behind Osama bin Laden's attack on the Twin Towers,"
lol'd
04XD
I'd like that

over how impossible it is to convince me of something
/me hides
04Most likely XD
derp
btw
Leo is kinda OOC
:x
04blah
04It was a short story
I know
I got my short story back today
teacher gave me a 15/20 lol
but hey
I wrote it in 30 minutes
04nice

too short damnit
04I KNOW RIGHT
04they never give you enough words
gtg bbl

I don't write short stories
or oneshots, really
04ok then
you should know that by now Drake
04well I'll admit I've never seen you write a short story, neither have I actually heard you say you dislike it
well
you haven't seen anything besides "The Thief"
and even then that one isn't a good example
I can write short stories
Doesn't mean I will
Hell
04:/
you could possibly count the Fro x HML as a short story if you want
but I wouldn't
:x
I'll go write one for you after I come back from dinner
or something random

What OS do you use?
also, > assuming people have apt-get
enjoy your VERSION, silly
most linux OSes have apt-get
derp
no they don't.
or at least the popular ones do
or yum
far from all.
apt-get is to be found in Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems.
or the other package installer stuffs
debian is awesome though derp
/me uses Arch.
redhat/centos/etc uses yum
ah
I haven't used Archlinux
Ah
What desktop environment does Archlinux use?
none.
o-o
Arch comes without a graphical environment.
you put whatever you want on it.
Arch comes with just the most basic requirements to run.
Ah
I use Awesome with Xfce/gtk apps.
xfce lol
heh
at least it doesn't use KDE
or Unity for that matter
ubuntu recently decided to switch to Unity instead of Gnome :x
You could throw KDE on it
Archlinux makes me think of freebsd though, as that doesn't have a GUI
there probably is a Unity package by now.
unity is retarded
you can put just about whatever on Arch.
I never heard of people using KDE with Arch
but there are packages for it.
Ah
I mostly use debian (especially for servers) but I'm on linux mint
this laptop has winxp and linux mint 9
mint comes with a lot of useless crap :x
that's one of the reasons I like Arch
it comes with nothing, thus no crap.
this is how my screen looked a lil' while ago, showing only irc: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-05_irssi.png
Ah
also, me prodding my IRC bot's code: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-09_minnet.png
What programming language is that? sort of looks like C
;x
Lua.
Ah
never heard of it
protip: the headers read "File: cmdarray.lua", "File: db.lua" :P
I saw the .lua bit
o-o
and just because I can
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-05-05.png - current desktop.
looks nice
clean etc.
heh
arch sounds like the complete opposite of ubuntu
I don't like ubuntu
DRAKE.
it's past your bed time
when do you go? >:
04not sure
04I should actually be in bed
04oh well
:D
stay longer
/me hugs
Arch also has a rolling release model
there is never a new version of Arch, stuff is just updated whenever new things come.
04I'll try
/me hugs back
:3
/me hugs
Ah
I haven't updated my friend's ubuntu server :x
there's like, 136 updates needed, 91 security updates
:x
04You hug me alot lately
rofl
yeah
because I want to visit you
12
12 updates for my laptop.
yay, new minor release for the kernel.
derp
146 packages can be updated.
97 updates are security updates.
too lazy to run updates
there's no such thing as a security update here.. all updates are software updates of one kind or another.
Ew kernels ;p
04XD
04So you can hug me?
/me hides
well, ubuntu is crap
...wow. 2.6.24 was some time ago.
And you call that a desktop XD
now downloading 2.6.38.6 :p
it's just not cluttered like most people seem to like them.
Not compatible
I don't see why I need stuff on the desktop.
Windows derp ;D
pretty much
I never got to hug you last time
it's a place for a wallpaper and some stats.
And that seems to be all :P
windows sucks.
Really, they should just remove the wallpaper and stats features and make into DOS
DOS is crap.
With no colour either ;}
hah
my terminal is awesome
green on black background
THE MATRIX.
Same here derp
When I get bothered to use linux that is
derp
I had purple text on black before
(Hint: That's never, or rare)
04XD

Not much I suppose, just relaxing at the moment while listening to my friends on Teamspeak. How about yourself?
i just ordered a nametag, and i'm installing a new Supercard for my sister
Is there anything unique about your nametag? and that's nice of you to do.
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
What's a supercard?
a super card is just like a R4...but then 50000000000000000000 times better :P

Hahaha
I just noticed that his hat says "WTF"
lol
wtf is a good way to describe it XD
yeah it is :P
also, I just thought I'd point it out before I forget
we all have a bit of Fluttershy in us
lol
well, never
link?
but I seemed to have more tolerance for him than most people
Now he's even annoying me
I'll find a couple
why what's he saying now
/me starts venturing back to the forums he goes to
"I KNOW RELIGIOUS DEBATES AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE FORUM BUT I'M GOING TO START ONE ANYWAYS"
Not even anything specific
Like here's one
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-346189.html#346189
wow that's pointless
herp derp I reported you
then here used to be a post saying "don't abuse the word filter" with a quote with the filtered word in it
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-344035.html#344035
oh hey one more post and I'll be at 50
50 posts!?! what an accomplishment!
:P
then http://www.spyroforum.com/post-344873.html#344873 and http://www.spyroforum.com/post-345696.html#345696 making it VERY CLEAR that he doesn't care
lol good job
I just broke 4000 on SF
@__@
will I not be a Dragonfly anymore after 50? :P
I dunno
RDX ended up doing the rankings
I SHALL FIND OUT :D
and he spelled "Rhynoc" wrong
XD
oh yeah, and the piracy thing
where he said that he only pirates because he doesn't have the money
and everyone who disagrees with him about piracy is an atheist
omg yeah that bugged me alot
I dunno, he's just... never been this annoying
I almost wonder if he's turned into a troll
off topic, and I apologize, but I am still a dragonfly :(
yeah me too
if he has, he's a pretty successful one -.-
I think he turned into a troll as soon as he realized SR was NOT going to make him a mod
XD probably
and as soon as SR stopped being nice to him :P
"All my best behavior isn't making me a moderator, so I'm going to be as annoying as possible"
"If the mod isn't gonna be mah fraaaand what's the point of taking this place srsly"
mah fraaand hahaha

My dad wanted to show off his new Mustang

He scratched it against the side of the garage when he was pulling it out
it was pretty awesome
oh no, he scratched it just now?
He's outside right now trying to get the paint from the garage off
lol
Surprisingly he didn't seem like he wanted to kill me when it happened though
Is it bad that I saw Mustang and though "Pony"? :P
he wasn't mad you mean?
thought*
XD yes it is dari, yes it is
yes it is dari
because even I didn't think that
a few years ago he probably would have started yelling at me about it

he got super mad
and that's how equestria was made
Well now it's just random spam messages
This time it was LOL
its just a botnet
Yeah, then I apologized and said I mean "schediaphile." xDDD
the nicks are predictable
4 characters all the time
what is schedia?
I think the actual word is hippophile (saw it on ponychan).
Which is a sexual attraction to cartoon characters.
ah
For horses.
Not anymore
Dari: I made up the term offhand, hippophile sounds right.
so he's a schediaequiniphiliac
^LOL
haha
what are they like now?
I mean the realnames
well they're like random mashes of keyboards
So he ends with saying "I'm not going to give you the pleasure of responding," which meant the party was over for the day.
I think that's the realname?
well at least for you
Koj is still calling him Body Oder
then he went into the other room and started talking to a bucket of turnips.

was she the one who was telling me not to "start a flame war" when I first joined?
Haha, he posts a basically irrelevant picture. But at leats he acknowledged that he got .jpg sniped.

She's the McCarthy of the forum.
For a mod I set the worst example ever.
By trolling a member?

HELLO WORLD
WHERE IS THE MASTER
OF SPYRONESS ROCKING
FOR I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
said the echidna
in all caps
New Ubuntu is strange
that's what I heard
03f
03whoops
/me stabs Adobe CS5 suite to hurry up installing
12lol
12nevah
12your computer will bluescreen at 99%
03nah, it finished
12nuuuu
03LOL
12must get doc's time machine
03it installs slow as frick though
12got to undo this injustice
03there's a 5.5?
there's a 5.5!
03wtf does it do?
Nothing?
it installs CS 5.5 on your computer.
12what the heck
03I mean, what does 5.5 have that 5 doesn't
12firefox wasn't my default web browser?
12when did that happen
hurr
A4, AE 5.5, IS/ID 5.5, AX
etcetc
o,o
03I have AX from standalone, but there's an A4?
I've been ranting on about the new A4 in #p-o & here
you got short-term memory ploblem?
03I haven't seen it
03is it any better than 3?
thats tr00
it's better and worse.
do you need to edit in surround?
03I thought A3 did that?
its easier in A4, since its inline, not simulated.
K, while I am merely backing my data up as a safeguard, I may actually just fully switch to new Ubuntu for my netbook
03eh
03so should I get rid of all this CS5 crap I just installed and install CS5.5?
when you mixdown it is genuine surround, but its just nonintuitive not being able to work in native surround, thats all
up2u, some apps weren't updated.
check out adobe.com for new features. if you don't need it, don't install
03well does the CS5.5 master suite include Acrobat and Audition?
03as those two I had to do separately with 5
>master
it does now, since A4 is CS.
AX releases are often separate from CS.
03wait so instead of CS it's A4?
*new
what
A3 wasn't in CS.
03wait
03oh
*AX releases schedule is separate from CS.
03anyway eh
03since I already have AX I'll just leave CS5 alone
did you even need any new features in AcrobatX?
03sorta
which ones?
03because with Acrobat 9, it kept erroring when I tried to open PDFs inside my browser
03so it's mainly to fix that, as X seems to work well for now
oh?
03yeah
03it did tlhat for my mom too and she was using the free Adobe Reader 8
03and I had 9
03and both did that
03it would be like "An error has occured so you can't view this PDF in your browser' and would open separately
03both Adobe Reader X and Acrobat X seem to have fixed that
i use chrome `\(°.o)/´
03well I use Firefox so :P
i herd you liek memory hogs and memory leaks
and a bazillion toolbars
03I just hate the way Chrome looks
lol chrome
03two != a bazillion
Yup
Junh is rigtht
;p

Or so I've seen
one, two, skip a few, ninety-nine, a bazillion.
How many buttons can you see :o
03uh huh
just like you hijacked that counting thread on TST
So many pretty (useless) buttons ;p
i can do it too, right?
03any interest in a 5 minute TS of Shaun the Sheep?
03from Disney Channel
Surewhynot?
How many MBs/
500? ;o
03around that
it has DXD logo?
New face
or a whatlogo?
DxD
03Disney Channel logo.
03I don't have DXD in HD yet
03I will in about a month
03actually
03I might have it next week
we have it in HD already
hmm, ntx then & internets
not that it really matters
What provider DRF?
I don't watch Disney XD anyway
WOW or UMICH?
;o
03yeah it's 433MB
03so cable FTW
not so
03http://bayleef.hoshinet.org/~drf/Shaun%20the%20Sheep%20-%20Zebra%20Ducks%20of%20the%20Serengeti.ts
you still get it from satellites
03orly
03you can GET the channel, you can't RECORD it on your computer
that is how the "cable" channels backhaul signals
yes you can
with special tuner cards
you can do it with KIDS & WOWOW, not?
Heya Credit
> with special tuner cards < i can buy one for DVB_S in NZ
oh?
Dish Network and DirecTV use DVB-S
inb4: indirectV
03yes but encrypted
I can recall seeing it on early receivers from both providers
03yeah, I get disney XD HD on June 9th.
03so not next week
03http://content.wowway.com/documents/WOWWAY/PDFs/Cable/DTA/MichiganTransition.pdf
03but I will have Starz kids HD next week, so hopefully I can record Pokémon 4Ever off it, as they regularly show that movie
03and Starz usually doesn't upscale. :P
you are forgetting something else
HD satellite receivers from both providers offer component video out
03hm?
03I said DIRECT STREAM COPY
I does not effing matter
03doing that is recompressing already compressed material
you will be getting the stuff in HD as is
03and component doesn't do 5.1 audio :P
03I just have a CableCard from my provider, I pay like $3 a month for it
03and get everything
03none of this tier BS
meh
cab;e
*cable
03the cable system here is really good
pay through the roof for less
03and you might be pleased that they're getting rid of analog next week
03I'm kinda annoyed as the two CRTs we have in our house now need special settop boxes >_>
03but that's what's allowing them to add like 50 more HD channels
in fact Pokemon 4 Ever should have been bundled instead of Destiny Deoxys
that is a serious WTF thing
or M6
not 6
bundle 6 and 7
not 5 and 6
03inb4 misty
03there IS a movie 4 and 5 bundle DVD
more like EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
03and it has movie 4 in widescreen :P
SD
03yes SD, but widescreen
03anamorphic
03Heroes is still crap
I am moving over to HD and would prefer HD over SD
03as much as I agree iwth you that pre-AG > AG, movie 7 is my second favorite.
03I just love the whole city, how it's all techy xD
03and Rayquaza is probably my favorite Pokémon so you do the math
the masters that most TV stations get for M4 aren't HD. Haven't seen any.
then I will send the Destiny Deoxys Blu Ray to you if I buy the bundle
M5, however, was HD in JAPAn, i think
M5 US, unsure/
03I mean, there is *no* existing rip *anywhere* of the movie Hollywood Homicide in anything above DVD resolution
03but it aired on Starz HD in proper HD
rather than destroy it in a microwave oven or by running it over with a car
03I have 4 separate TSes of it
03that I'm gonna try to delogo
03*cisc
03*DISC
03with the movie 4 and 5, it's a flippie
*cisc is a valid abbreviation.
03double sided disc
two would make the most sense
like, you have a CISC computer. so do most of the people here.
best quality
tr00
squeaksqueak
hi Sneas
if its one disc then NO SALE
hi
03so if the Blu-Ray is anything like the movie 4/5 combo DVD by the same studio, it'll be a double-sided disc, one movie on each side.
maybe I would just rip Pokemon Heroes off the disc and then put it away
rarely touching it
srry Danny
x.o
how is?

12o-O
ah
oh lol
somehow that reminded me of the Hensh
after chess today
well, chess competition at schools (we versed Marist Boys High or something)
I went out into the car park on the way to the bus stop
and I saw him getting into his car
and I was like "hi"
and etc.
and then I was like "have a safe trip home, don't crash, die, etc."
and he was like "don't crash? why?"
and I told him "because then I don't get to see you tomorrow"
and then he said "fair enough"
got into the car
and I said "okay, bye, don't crash etc. ...or run me over"
Hmm.
Beans.
If not I'll catch you tomorrow or whatever.
and the evil guy fucking smirked at me, reversed out, and as I stood to the side of the car park, drove right back into it
and "nearly" ran over me
fucking evil bastard tried to kill me! >:(
/me runs over Drake
04o-o
12trying to kill Drake
12fine is 2 dollars
I wasn't "trying" to kill him ;p
I either do or I don't
:D
12lol
and Drake
I got my Amus result sheet back today XD
04I think he likes you
04ohcool
they liked my performance
<Drake> I think he likes you
The Hensh?
04no
and likes in what way?
04the guy who tried to kill you
because that'd be fucking creepy
12fine
12the fine for killing Drake is 1 dollar
what guy who tried to kill me?
04the one who almost ran you over
that was Hensh xD
and he was joking with it
04oh
lmao
and yes, he has a care
car*
ffffffs
and I probably won't be on much tomorrow, Drake :x
04why?
not going to be home until around 9-10pm
probably
04:<
staying back at school
for sound and lighting stuff
with Hensh
12trying to get away from you
04oh
derp
and also
we finished macbeth at school
we're studying Lord of the Flies
whatever the fuck that is
I have the book sitting next to me
12i know that story
TTEchidna, im around for 2 minutes
it reminds me of some of my fantasies
except less violent
12....
/me hides

Umbreon you know lol
Reminiscence was made after a dream I had
and TCTL was from a fantasy

.______.

04what the hell happened there?
derp
04thanks
04ohthatpsychicthing
anyway
yaeh
yeah*
04I seem to be getting story ideas from dreams alot lately
04I had another one last night but it's hard to remember and very...uh...out of the ordinary
I've had a few
I have a few dreams/fantasies I like to keep in mind
I have 3 main ones atm
04I like to do the same
XD
04I have a couple I haven't actually put into words at all
same
04There's that psychic one, the mercenary one, a sci-fi one...
derp
most of mine involve the Hensh in some way usually as a villain :x
04also the one from the dream I had last night
04which was weird yet inspiring
I have a shitload of dreams
see
Reminiscence was inspired by a dream
Actually, it was Seran's Story specifically
But then I made it into Reminiscence :x
04XD
well
merged it with my school project thing
XD
04Alot of my stories are born from stealing off other franchises.
04:3
lmao
heh
TCTL was inspired while I was in china last year
basically I was thinking of being kidnapped/having terrorists on the plane
:x
04XD
notice how most of the stuff I end up writing is depressing
04lol
Do you remember The Shadow Pokemon: Shadow Lugia?
I shat brix at it now
:x
04XD
but oh god
that reminds me of that dragonkeeper fic that I wrote
:X
04o-o
remember
04never knew you wrote one
with Rotyr/Kai?
the really retarded one?
04nope
and with "shadowslayer" crap that possessed people
uh sec
I'll pastebin
04don't worry
04I'm busy playing Tri atm anyway
heh
you'd cringe at it
found it Drake
it's called "The Dragon of the Five Elements"
04o_O
/me crings

http://pastebin.com/n7fTmXdX
@ Drake
/me cringes more
"Syjin was overcome with grief and died. "
:x
04...
04wat

don't

I don't even know why I still have it
it's fucking retarded
04I think it could
;x
mfw I read it like 6 years after I wrote it
04XD
04the original TMoaTB is terrible
not as bad as this Drake
seriously
TMoaTB has a good concept though
06why was my name Espeonz
04blah
04not particularily

jesus universehosting's cpanel lags like f***
oh.
wait what the hell
o_O
hm okay
finally got through the ANNOYING process of recompiling all of islands modules
now that's awesome.
believe it or not that's not a vhost
Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99
<3
lol
finaaaaaaaally works
what exactly were you trying to get to work
it's reverse dns
!dns tintower.ho-ohrealm.net
Resolved tintower.ho-ohrealm.net to: 64.37.49.99
!dns 64.37.49.99
Resolved 64.37.49.99 to: tintower.ho-ohrealm.net
:D
so basically I connect with tintower.ho-ohrealm.net as my IP
instead of a normal IP or ISP/server provider hostname
it's a reverse DNS*
ahh
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is Testgeddon@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net * Testgeddon
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is using modes +iw
[22:37:43] Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99
the "is connecting from" bit is the user's real IP
as opposed to any possible vhosts set by the server
oh
so yeah
<3
been trying to get one for the BNC servers for ages
I wish we could get one for flame
and rainbow/shadow/ambernova
now that'd be awesome
anyway bbl shower
kk
well, i g2g soon anyways
bbl
/me hugs everyone
i g2g

-_-
but hi HML
Heya :<
Why all the recompiling?
island got moved
Oh
^
Whyy?
and the server went down
-y
dunno
Fail
drf showed me the email he got
Now we need a new IP for it?
some admin did it
I commented on Arti's profile
:o
asking her to change the DNS entry of tst.lugia.us or add the island.lugia.us DNS
to 67.21.84.209
Baw
How am I supposed to remember that?
yeah it's hard to remember
hopefully she'll add the DNS entries
or I'll make one off my own domains
but anyway, yay
finally got reverse DNSes for tintower
<3
Does it still haver +1337 ;p
yeah
Good
nothing has changed except for the IP
Such a shame :<
Oh wells
Time to edit the bouncer entry
!island
!online
it's annoying when island is down because my BOPM goes down too as I have it set to connect to island
ail
derp
67.21.84.209
is the IP
I know :P

06I never said it was the right approach
06And I never said that it's not obvious she doesn't really learn from her mistakes.
06But still
6I don't think she understands the gravity of her situation.
06sextuple post MUST be a new record though
6Well, in order to teach her, I'll take myself as an example; ban her without notification it's temporary.

04|D
13can't we just friggin' get rid of her already? :|
/me runs
06I have a rather strange stance on things anyway
06give people chance(s), but if they don't learn then there should be "proper" consequences :B
06But oh well
06and bite me I'm using :B for some reason
6Well, about the 'without notification' part:
6Putting a serious comeuppance leads her to think about her actions.
0610xPost wtf
6We've noticed. :P
06And yeah, but still - "No notification" just leads to MAD and confusion
6A ban? Maybe.
6But she can't do anything about it, right? :P
13Honestly, I don't think she even knows she's doing anything wrong, no matter how many times you warn her
13:|
6"But my popularness might ge me in BIG trouble..." <-- Ah, ha... hah.
6You don't say?
06AE, that's kind of obvious
06The things I said = my general stance on things
06She's had quite a few chances >->
13I don't see why we should all be forced to continue tolerating someone who won't even learn their lesson~
6Who locked the thread?
xD

03Whoa what's wrong with her o_o
6I can guess someone (tried to) explain to her?
03@ the thread
6I'd say tweenage moodage.
6Well, how's this; have the community criticize her.
03That's a pretty insane response to having a sig removed
6Perhaps she doesn't act different because she isn't getting any response (well, not much, mine is rather advanced for her) from other people.
06"rather advanced for her"
06wtf is that even supposed to mean?
6Un-understandable.
6For a person her age.
06Maybe it's an idea to "dumb" it down a bit then? :P
6I did.

04ALL OF THE GOOD EVENTS ARE THERE
04AND I CAN'T GO THERE ON JUNE 8TH FOR E3 BECAUSE IT'S A SCHOOL DAY
/me stabbs a plastic bag full of cotton
6Skip school? :P
04I wish?
04>
04*>_>
6If you don't have anything significant.
04Dad might take me
04Probably
04But I'll be lucky if he does :|
06I'd say things can be made more understandable, but fair enough. If someone seems to not understand, I just assume they're not a native English speaker AND that they're rather young.
06But that's my approach
02How old are you in first place? o3o...
04no it's not?
02Yes chime, it is. it has always been that way.
/me yawns
06"Did you see it? xD That was funny!"
6O_o
6O_____o
6Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey.
6Yeah, give her a ban. ovo
12Getting banned might be funny too!
02^
/me goes to do some homework
06I guess the attention was too much for her (´◉◞౪◟◉)
Y U DUN BAN?!
6So, what action shall we take? (Hmm, sudden serious sensation I just had.)
HMM
Shun
02BANHAMMER?
Nah
Shunhamme
06Looking at her profile makes it all just seems like an attempt to get attention lol
6I'd love to snark back at her. ovo
02my snark is a boojum
6So, ah, any resolution? Xvx
6Okay.
sir
10"Am I in trouble? Sorry for that..."
10Hum..
12XD
10Articuno posted
6Well, there's that popular criticism idea I mentioned.
6Want the rest of us to comment? ovo

03Off Topic: Pony fan or not this must be watched

6Wait, "more than just a punishment"?
?
6"Someone please say something.... I'd like to hear from a Admin.... Because they are nice, and are calm..." <-- Yet she gets annoyed at them?
oh
what did she do?
10More than just one punishment, forgot to add "one"
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.0
6For one.
6Ah.
10Meaning, she needs to be banned for at least a week or two
6Ah, wish Arti was on chat.
12So she says
10I'll notify her of that
LMFAO ARTY!
12I think she's in 3rd grade if you ask me XD
OWNED!
6I dunno, she told her school to the forums.
6And it's real school.
uh oh
at least lots of them don't have mIRC
10I recall that, which thread was it?
6Hmm, let me check:
GTG going to town
12I think it was in her old signature, I might be wrong though
03*WB02(WhiteTail02)03WB* - <Zoroark> 12So what? It's ok to bend the rules at times
6Hey, Arti.
ohai Arti
6You know we've got a situation.
12Welcome back, Articuno
12Oh?
12Thanks!
okay I guess I'm not going to town yet
hey Arty Chan
how have you been all this time?
12Yeh apparently she's 13 O_____o
o_O
12and I've been super super super super busy
12^v^
02Hi arti~
heh
12I've been very busy as well, lol
12Which one..?
oh I think maybe the reason why she got it unlocked was because it was 'her' topic. Wasn't there an option that you can continue to post even if your topic is locked?
6Well, if you want to hear those ideas: Group criticism and a false permanent ban.
All I can say is..... this thread is SO ridiculous that I'm going to lock it rather than delete it so everyone can read back on it!!
Also I don't get this, how old are you? Seriously....? Because your sig clearly said "Please read the rules". Did you read them? Of course not, that's why you have no idea why PART of your sig (that's right, NOT all of it) was removed.
You had three very large images in your sig, I removed two and kept one. Infact I kept the Reshiram one....
You are the one that deleted the REST of your sig, that's really, REALLY weird. All you had to do was realise that you had too many images, now you have no sig!...
What the fish?????
/me is amused by everything going on
that one
06Group criticism would hopefully not just be 15+ people going LOL UR GETTING BANNED but sadly enough that's still what I think people without enough knowledge would do .-.
i agree
6I don't think we all feel that, right?
/
/me has no clue what you people are on about. o3o
06I mean, it's either what's needed - for her to know that it's not just "a few meanies" who realize she's not taking any advice to heart at all, OR it will just pass from one ear (or eye, whatever) to another
I'm too lazy to click
12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.msg265160#new
12There's a direct link
i see
6Arti, what do you think?
well, after reading that randomness me is gonna finish my 30 min remix.
12I don't understand what you mean by a false perm ban ovO
12Didn't Aurora already try that?
6Wait, what'd Rora do?
whats false perm ban do?
12Can't remember
13OT but
13:3
12Yay
13ohai :P
6Mmm'kay.
6Well, back on topic:
12I personally think she'll go on a rage about how TST sucks etc. but I guess that's pretty normal.
oh why oh why is my iphone so slow?
06Oh hi
I just want upload a pic
6Hmm...
6Well, from my experience, it works. :P
02Hi~
hi
03Moo

6Hey. :>
I made this pic of from shugo chara
6Well, what are the other options, Arti?
also I'm up for giving Hai another chance
^
on the one with the angel wings
I mean, we all start somewhere in the internet world heh
Oh wow, hey doods :3
12hm
12Or a warning of a temp ban
you know be reasonable about it and don't go all LOL UR GONNA GET BANT
02DOOD, Disgaea right? :3
and hi shadow lugia
6Warnings didn't help before, Night.
Erm, sure thing? Man I haven't been on the chat for a while so I might be a bit rusty XD
really?
06oh yes
12Yes
soo what she do before?
6I'm going to leave in three minutes, and return.
12Same kind of stuff

13I dunno if this works for everything, but for my router I just log into it by typing the IP address into the address bar
4it knows Splash, Hidden Power, Tackle and Pound
13then changing the security settings to WEP temporarily
13so i can use wifi on my DS
4i just type in my password
/me 4is on GBU, Launcher Battle, Ratings
4just hope i find someone
02also, Chao dsi internet options != Game internet options
02So, you must have WEP internet
4y'know Ray, i bet you can connect you just don't really know how :P
correct
the Pokemon games only support WPA encryption
4sometimes i miss stuff that are right under my nose
02maybe~
4you should connect, that way you can have Sweet Dreams~
4and for some reason my wi-fi isn't working right now
02however, if you can get Pokemon Pt. to work with my internet, you'll be my best friend :3c

How the hell do you stop it?

Stop it? HAHAHA. You can't stop it!
XD
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

Oh... Lol.
Until your head explodes like an overcooked POT PIE.
I don't hear anything

no music
"Any and all, come to me and share in my good fortunes! for I, Lucky Streak, the Colt of Chance, extend a welcome hoof!"
we'd best start believing in troll IRC conversations?

Hoofpumping, lol!
Oh my God, it's that awesome song from the exposion video!

Princess Trollestia lol
Seriously, my computer froze and kept skipping on that audio
Lawl.
I kept trying to turn the sound down or end the process
and then suddenly it wouldn't stop skipping
And I got a BSOD and a force restart
O_o
WOAH-OH-OH-AH-AH-AAAAAA-HA-AH-AH-HA-AAAH
/me clears his thorat and sits down.
NOOO
*throat
I wonder if thorat is a real word
sounds like a bug of some sort
You mean thorax?
uh oh
oh yeah that would be it
It's a good thing Ping and I are in cahoots.
you weren't yesterday
We had a little spat -- nothing major.
It wanted some space, I was bored as hell...
OK what the heck
Now I can't even connect to the internet on that computer anymore
/nevergoingtoponychanagain
I blame dari
jk dari
Yeah, let's blame it all on ponychan. :P
:P
oh, and now a problem with the java updater
woot
=/
all of this on the netbook?
yes
what the hell, ponychan
rawr!
what the hell
What OS is that computer?
XP
why?
Just wondering.
rawr...
/me is having weird computer problems again...
He wants to hazzor ur face
oh, well the internet connection thing is solved
Was it the butler?
hmm?
I swear, it's always the butler.
apparently I accidentally turned off my wireless somehow =/
/me glares at dari
huh
I guess it's not the butler then
nope
@dari: y u shut off wirluss!!!/1?1
It was Trollestia
Well, the butler has to get his kicks somehow.
(:
I think you put something in our meal this evening.
That's one way of putting it.
for me at least
yeah, I figured that could be a coincidence
So it was the coffee he poisoned!
come to think of it, it's probably because it couldn't connect to the internet
That explains the Java problem.
:P
oh yeah, I suppose
kind of stupid of them to just have it crash though
That's what you stepped in, that's what was on your shoe, and that explains the abarasion on your palm!
Daaaamn, I'm good.
gtg dinner
XD
true
ILLEGAL EXCEPTION CAUGHT: Can't connect to internet for the update. Prepare for a system crash.
"Windows was temporarily unable to read your hard disk drive. We don't know the exact cause of the problem. In most cases, this type of condition is momentary and doesn't indicate a serious problem, but sometimes it means that a hard disk is failing. "
Fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
...
let's hope it's the ?in most cases? one
Common causes of this problem
Aging or failing hard disks. To prevent file corruption and data loss, we recommend that you back up all of your important files and folders immediately. See step 1 in the section below for more information.
Large file transfers from secondary media, such as an external hard drive, to a local hard drive.
Loss of power to a hard disk drive that causes inconsistent data sectors.
Hard disk-intensive processes such as antivirus scanners.
Recently installed hardware that might have compatibility and performance problems.
*"in most cases"
Do you think that hard disk failure was the reason for Plessy v. Ferguson?
Nowhere does it say "Annoying audio loops on ponychan"
that makes it sound like it may have to do with the AVG update
I can haz all secret ponychan boards.
*that in
I only updated AVG on my other computer

04Portal 2 > Portal
04Yes or no?
12no
04:O
04why

04lul

i haven't played portal 2 either
12:<
youtube doubler?
04Ahwell
He wanted to know what WOAH-OH_OH and Nyan Cat would sound like together, so yeah.
04After playing Portal 1 it seemed TOO SHORT
04I mean
04REALLY too short
04X_X
LOL awesome.
Nyan is shorter than WOAH-OH-OH, however, so eventually they will not be synced.

04no

Lol, Tacnayn.
/me Now Playing: Katy Perry - Firework (ST★RLYTE Extended Remix)

Yep.
I prefer Tacnayn.
I'm not sure which is better, keyboard cat, or nyan cat.
keyboard
Keyboard cat was never entertaining.
Heathen. :P
what? someone who doesn't like keyboard cat?
o.o
I know
sup guise
also the thing you said about keyboard cat is kinda like how I feel about Nyan cat :P
/me is surrounded by blasphemers.

They were hindering my winning.

12wow
12then drf said "LOL I LOVE THIS SONG"
OK, so, I'm filling out a job application
And they have this questionaire thing
o-o
back
The question I'm on is "What percentage of politicians do you think are honest?"
What should I answer? o___O
0
lol
03o.o
hm
drf
you there?
03yes
derp
safe bet lol
it seems like an odd question.
I know, why would they ever need to know that?
"you are wasting my time"
And "50% or less" is the lowest option
its multiple choice?
it's multiple choice
laa
what job are you applying for
Target
sou
ah
I'd only be there for like three months until school starts again
is it 50% or less or 50% or more?
what options
1 . 95% to 100% 2 . 90% to 94% 3 . 75% to 89% 4 . 50% to 74% 5 . Less than 50%
faa
12how goes XD
hai Umbreon
early shift sandwich .-.
9am today and tomorrow
today meaning earlier
I wonder what reason they could have to ask that
I know some jobs ask you a silly question or two
but its meant to check out your ability to think critically
yous?
This questionnaire is completely filled with stupid questions
There's one that asks about how tactful you are
And more that ask about how happy you are with your life
"How many items have you stolen from target in the past?"
"How many do you plan on stealing while employed here?"
lol
that sounds like a typically application question, but as for how many politicians you trust, I dunno about that one
why do they even bother asking that?
dead tonight
*typical
I would sue and say its discrimination!
against politicians!
12i'm becoming a booknerd D:
12to an extent
totally
XD
watcha reading?
and against percentages!
12i wanted to get rid of all my stephen king books that i never read
Maybe that could pay for my tuition instead of working
hahaha
ah
12so i took them to this place that exchanges books for credit and with the credit i bought like half the animorph series
lolz
Oh, now it wants to know about my grades in high school
well just chose some midground in the politicans question
12which was all the copies they had
12not counting doubles
you dont trust them all but you dont think everything they say are lies
yeah
12i already am half way into #1
Pretty much all I can do if I don't know what they're looking for
you should scan that application id like to see it
these questions are so stupid though

Pablo Escobar was a drug cartel leader guy a while back

that's why I was confused

12It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoriant effects from eating capsaicin-flavored foods. Folklore among self-described "chiliheads" attributes this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. In support of this theory, there is some evidence that the effect can be blocked by naloxone and other compounds that

Umbreon, you are a 15Snover.
sigh.. nick alerts. >.>
12sorry :/
12just a way to get your attention
12...and then make you leave on accident
Boop
12!pokemon
Umbreon, you are a 11Reshiram.
03no
12wow that's awesome so it's true
12parts of bruce almighty was filmed in the same set of back to the future
because if i'm advising you to do it, i'd better put my money where my mouth is.
03I'm not going to mess with my CPU >_> <_<
you already fudged with it
it's not messing with your CPU
plus you gain nothing from hyper threading
03I just put it in the socket
03that's all
it's called turning off a BIOS setting. its completely safe.
if anything you LOSE performance
you'r not messing with voltage or megahurts.
it just how the OS manages & sees the CPU. thats all.
03I like having hyperthreading.
03also wtf, since when do i3s hyperthread
since 2009
If it's the "if it crashes it only crashes to 12.5%" "reason", thats the lamest excuse, and it's not as beneficial as you think.
if you can give me a sensible reason, fine
03that it's my CPU and I don't feel like modifying settings?
03I'd be more interested in a setting that makes eSATA actually work
03as right now it doesn't
03even though I have it in AHCi mode
that excuse is lame
so what
your i7 also has this turbo thing, iirc
that "12.5%" really IS 25%
if not more
03I dunno, but I do know that my 2.8GHz i7 gets the same performance score as my 3.2GHz quad core AMD
03so it obviously performs better
under what conditions?
03Windows Experience Index.
b00
that is not exactly a good benchmarking utility
it's at a max. of 25%, mb a bit less because of switching time, because it can't stride more than 1 physical core. but the extra heat generation doesn't quite register in this metric
soyea,
03w/e
well here is yet another way the SPP forums FAIL
no custom avatar options
its annoying
especially if you made your own and would like to use is
*it
I made this really nice custom animated avatar which is something you don't see much
12i wanna make an avatar relating to pokemon vietnamese crystal
you can't use it on the SPP forum
I am not sure about the one here though
12i'm not part of SPP
12so i don't care
you don't want to be
its a war zone
so is bulba
but to a lesser extent
not much less though
so are, many other pokemon forums because
>pokemon
you know about as well as I that Pokemon's fan base is polarized
especially the anime fan base
12there is no such thing as an internet utopia
12there is no such thing as a utopia
12an
some smaller forums come close but that is true
12smaller forums with a strict user acceptance will come close
12but they all eventually meet their end
so the spitty forums will live on yet the good ones will die
in your mind
12the spitty forums live on because they have a gigantic fanbase supporting it
12even though they are corrupted
I can't say it because of the epic failure that is +G
12lol
12the pattern i have seen
12is the more people become aware of a community, the more it falls
I actually fought long and hard to keep +G from being set on another forum's IRC channel
12o-o
12+G is a big deal?
yes
if you have an overzealous op who turns it into a kick/kill script like what happened here
12so people aren't allowed to swear and swearing is met with negative reinforcement
this tended to cause problems as the server actually confused some words for what was in its list of stuff to be blocked
the overzealous op's script automatically kicked people when they cursed
which resulted in kicks being a regular thing
12so you're saying the swear filter isn't perfect?
yes
the curse filter is highly flawed
12i don't think i ever seen that happen here
it happened quite a bit
computers are not perfect
they do make mistakes
and they do end up with false matches
12it's only common sense
12computers are a creation of man
12which we ourselves are flawed
plus you have to live with the fact that cursing is everywhere
especially in this day and age
12cursing is everywhere
12but that doesn't mean it should be invited with open warms
12"oh swearing happens everywhere, okay swear as much as you want"
I am not saying to invite it
I am saying that you should live with the fact that it exists
12i know it exists
12a person at my bus stop for school used to swear ever 5 seconds
12it drove me nuts
plus the way I see it if you don't drop the F bomb all the time then its tolerable
12i completely agree in front of the right audience
12swearing can be used to express true anger but when you use it every 5 seconds it just loses it's meaning
12it's nothing but an empty word then
I use cursing to express anger and that is about it
the "swear" thing sounds like something a 5 or 10 year old would say
and I refuse to say that
12?
because it just seems childish
12what does?
calling cursing "swearing"
12sigh
12both ways are valid
!define swearing
-!- Any time Latest <a
-!- 2 days Past week <a
12oh yeah i forgot x-x
-!- year Custom range... <input type=hidden name=ie
-!- value="ISO-8859-1"> <table
-!- style="width:130px;border-collapse:collapse"> From: To: ex: 5/23/2004
121. Make a solemn statement or promise undertaking to do something or affirming that something is the case: "he swore to obey the rules".
121. Invoke or use a curse against: "the family had been cursed".
12i'm going to take a nap, see ya

ugh
playlist.com fails
I am listening to a beautiful and moving song and they rudely interrupt it with this ad on a loop
so it ruins the mood
better: move ad to inbetween songs?
right
like they do on broadcast radio
instead Playlist.com cranks the annoyance factor on their ads up to a level 100
that's still under 9000 though
/me hides
right
but enough with the Dragon Ball Z meme
its one of the most over used and abused ones of all time
I found it annoying because I had Eva Cassidy's moving redition of Fields Of Gold interrupted by an Airwick ad
and now Errol Garner's Misty
its that same Airwick ad too
they just bombard you with increasingly annoying ads
if you listen long enough
its on an auto replay loop
I am tempted to find something else
because this site is getting worse and worse

And how do they manage to use the same orange every episode
Couldn't the orange have like, rotted
Probably they have a picture of the orange, or they find similar ones

They clone it every episode
If by cloning, you mean photoshop

Reminder to self: never trust dad's dishwashing for anything
He never cleans the dishes well, leaving food bits stuck everywhere <<
13Ew
13I consider myself the best dishwasher in my house |D
13my dad doesn't really wash the dishes much, and my mum sometimes doesn't clean them properly
13so :B
I complained to my dad that this is giving me problems
He shoots back with, "then why I don't get it?"
Spoiler: back in his younger days, when Singapore = third-world backwater, and nearly everybody lived in villages, he ate food out of trash cans and had parasites in him
(Major ew, I know)

._____________________________________________________________________________.
o.ô
His body probably had all sorts of resistances to bacteria that could send me into agony
It's disgusting, his lifestyle
He never seemed to depart from the ways of village living
o.o
hmm
I have gotten into arguments with my dad over his hygeine countless times
I have mostly given up
I have learned to work around his ways, mostly
13You know what would be a good idea? Washing the dishes yourself :B
13Lol, silly next door neighbour is attempting to set up a trampoline outside in the rain
hehe xD
YESH! i just got word from the tag company, my nametag is sended, i will recieve it tommorow :P
13is it just me or is youtube being dodgy right now?
but for cooking instruments I leave it to him, since I trust the heat to kill the bacteria
Next time I'm doing the dishes myself though
He usually complains that I use too much water and soap
Well, he uses too little of it <<

Oh hi.

12Right! Time to get chat back on site
03God dang it large log files and notepad
Lag
03I had it loaded, went to maximize the window, it froze again
So deadly
03well yeah it's like 100MB or something
Try a 6.3 MB notdoc
Oh
Wow
Good luc
03yeah
03IRC logs
03:P
03np
DRF has no life
03waid why did I just say np
;D
03HML LOL
03you do realize I'm logging the chat whether I'm away or not :P
03I just never disconnect unless my connection forces me off
03yay having two monitors?
if being "still here" is leaving for some 9 months or so then coming back then sure
I know :P
03My right one is pretty much only used for IRC
Yup
finally
03in a couple days
03I'll have my new monitors
Arty here it is
03two 1080p ones
03LED backlit
Goodness
03it's gonna be awesome
03yeah
Evil
03these are only 19"
i have 2 monitors but one is huge and sits on my desk all day doing nothing because it's pretty bad
How many in?
0321.5
03the smallest they make 1080p
03which means it'll have really sharp picture
thanks
^^
Ah, I have a 23 and 22ish monitor (can't use/steal the 22 in since I have no desk space left)
Go HD monitors
03well
03I was reluctant to get ones any bigger
Why?
03because I at one point had a 20" 16:9 as well as my 19"
03and it started hurting my neck
Stretching ;P
03as it was too wide
03no
03wtf stretching?
03you just set the resolution properly :P
O.o
I know :P
03but yeah
03my desk is only so big and I sit close
Which is why I have a 2nd monitor that is only 17in and 5:4 XD
So much easier
that's why i wouldn't like a hueg monitor
21" would be about how big i'd go
03yeah
drf should get a plasma screen computer
but i'm used to my 17" so yeah
03I figured half an inch won't hurt
03they don't make plasma smaller than 42"
03and um
TVs as computer
03that would majorly hurt
03well
03see
03that's actually sucky
03I have a 50" TV
03that's 1080p
Stretching
03I'll have a 21.5" monitor that's 1080p
And big pixels
:P
03which do you think will have a better picture
03:P
Strechy
Strechy
03and WTF is it with you and stretching HML
03if you use a computer you don't get stretching unless you're stupid
he's working out
XD
I mean, I used a 32in 720P monitor
For my laptop once
It looked bad, since it was 720 XD
1440 x 900 is good enough
/me sees HML strech reeeealy long
that's my laptop
03my laptop is 1680x1060 ;p
03er
031050
I have 1280x800
Lol
03and it's 15.4"
/me stretches out and yawns
because go die drf i hate you
03yes my 15.4" laptop has a bigger screen resolution than my 19" desktop monitor :|
And then 1280x1024 for my laptop's 2nd monitor
Shave
(At home)
i could set my CRT to many resoluion i wanted
but i never use it
and it's just kind of there
i don't think i'll ever dual-monitor
I never use higher than that on my CRT XD
Since it looks ugly ish
I'm going to Kings island tommorow with the school
i used 1186 x 364 or something like that when i used that CRt with my desktop
er
864
364 pixels high
03my mom still uses 1024x768 on her CRT
bess ever
Geex
z
Low res
XD
03I know right
Almost as bad as the Wii
it was origonally for clubs only. I wasn't in them. But I was joking around by asking my teacher and she took it seriously and said yes
my parents use a 1024x768 LCD
Oh wait
so win for me
LOL
My parents use a 1080 22in LCD
Which I got for free
And it has a webcam
i actually sometimes set games to 1024 x 768 windowed because my laptop is garbage at games anymore
13Your Spring Mountains and Pokemon Paradise pictures in your gallery are honestly amazing

13I don't have any, hence why I'm so bad at them LOL
13I'm the kind of person who's better at drawing the characters rather than the backgrounds xD
03I suck at all art
03well
03drawing, anyway
Same
I'm bad at music and art
03if you can consider video editing art, I'm good at that
03music <3
land scape drawing and painting are no different than aanime drawing
03I consider myself good at music
03I've made a bunch of different edits/remixes
you draw with your style and heart as well as with your rythme
Angry birds
i'm pretty good at playing instruments that make music
Weird game
and my ear is ringing
13but meh, I'm constantly trying to improve so~

04Those are the size of the images
04the sprites themselves might be that size, but the sprites are actually a bunch of seperated parts.
Haha
04All animated seperately.
Doing the old SNES trick
Good old nintendo
16 bit to be less nintendoy
04It works ;P
Giant Bosses?!
Oh
Just tons of sprites
Yet nobody notices :P
04And the only thing that involves 16 is the sprite palletes.
04Seriously
04you STILL can only use 16 colors in your sprites! X_X
O>o
Does the SNES have more ;P
04I mean, those 16 colors can be any colors at all, but still
04only 16 colors per sprite.
Ah, well just fail
04kinda
Amazing that the sprites look good
Imagine..8bit colour sprites
Now those would be nice
04out of the 765 possible pixel colors, only 16 of them are usable on each sprite
6The sprites themselves are really getting lower quality. :/
04Hur
04not exactly
Kinda
04It was the animation that killed it
But the animation
Agreeded
Lol
6No, not the animation.
04The quality was nice
04yes
6The SHADING. :U
04o-o
Shading O.o
04oh
6Reshiram has, like, only 5 colors in it.
04um
04no
04wait
6Not including the eye.
04haha
04It uses 12
04out of 16
04XD
04Guess you're right, then.
04The eye makes up one color
04The fire two
04wait no four
046 colors make up its WHITENESS
6Hmm, speaking of, do you know any people who have those 'secondary' panels from a sprite?
04huh?
6The sprites are animated, though most uploaders only show the primary panel or the whole animation.
04http://www.spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonblackwhite/reshiramani.png
6O_o
6Long animation...?
10...
04yep
04the animation itself is but the data is probably short.
Hai Sky
04It just tells the sprites to play a certain way for x amount of times, and tells another sprite to appear/disappear, replace itself...
04And those can have seperate timeframes.
04It's basically pixellated Flash |D
lol

wb
ug super mario land?
7Hey, Chao.
7Could you give me a few items rather than pokemon in B/W trades? :P
7I need the Power items to make EV training easier.
/me wishes SS could connect to the net as easily as BW
4uh sure
*sighs* I want celebi ;_;
4what do you need?
13I'm not EV training in White at all until I get Pokerus
7Every Power item. :P
13Which I should be getting at some point eventually
7And AE, I can give you a pokemon with it.
4*gasp* Pokerus!
13:D Really?
13it's all i'm waiting for at the moment xD
12pokerus
7Sure; I was really fortunate to find it on route 18 in the game's storyline. O_o
I got a better name for it
the P-Virus, has a resident evil tone to it don't it?
/me runs
13I have Pokerus in HeartGold, but I lack two DS's to transfer it across xD
13But yeah, I'd appreciate it if someone helped me out <3
7Want me or Umbry to trade?
I have SS angel but I cant get it to connect to the net :\
7Multiple pokemon with it? Yes.
13Well, I don't have Umbreon's friend code, so xD
12lol
4*_*
7So, what are you trading in return?
13I'll see what I've got, though I'll be honest and say I probably don't have anything particularly amazing to give in return ^^;
7Mmm'kay.
7I'd really like a Power item. :P
/me 4is ready
7o.o
13I've been saving up for a Power item myself actually
13I have enough BP to afford one, but I'll get one for you if you want :3
7Aw, thanks. :3
7I'd prefer the one that boosts Speed. :P
4i gave one of every Power item to my PKMN
bahh, bloody connection. x.x
4btw, I gave them to random pokemon so
13Do you mind what Pokemon you get in return? |D
12Night everyonre

does anyone know if its possible to make auto identify work on epic chat.net?
yepyep
for some reason i can't get it to work trough perform or script
mine works
Just throw in "/ns identify NoizeSpiral password" into your auto-perform
That's what I have, for all networks, and it works
ye i did that
didn't do anything different for this one
it always worked before but now some reason it doesnt
i got no clue why
:o
Hi other peoples!

(:
7Brb again...

ooooooo
Oblivion?
Morrowind
olol
noo
OH
A mod?
not at all
This is a ghost
oooooooooooooooooooo
oooo
From the past
the terrain is from the mod project I work on
o
ooooo
I approve!
the main game's land can be seen in the far distance
damn i almost forgot about that game
:o
I should play that.
this is the city down below http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9812/mgescreenshot6.jpg
I need a long period of time where I can sit down and do nothing but Morrowind, though!
and this is the ash swamp down at the bottom http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1286/mgescreenshot22.jpg
Cat, do you know of any good mods that make the combat suck ass a little less?
er
mmmmmmmmmm
I mean be less bad
<.<
the combat isn't that bad is it?
It's awful
The screenshots are not, though~
!
yeah, the wonders of the Morrowind Graphics Extender :p
thanks Kosoveon
back from a friends house
ate all his food
like we do at all of our friends houses :D
I have an urge to play an old game
what kind of food? :P
I took this one http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/MGE%20Screenshot%2067%20%282%29.jpg
But I have no idea what
I ate a slice of his pound cake
Cool!
everyone ate crakers with cheese and salami |D
i stopped playing that game
pound cake....<3
because of the repetative combat
Lemon pound cake :D
I'm surprised I'm not fat |D
I always tend to play mages
oh yes
XD
tough the rpg is awesome itself
it's not that it was repetitive
which are slightly less repetitive
the combat etc is very dull
it's just plain horrible
Well, I suppose you do do nothing but spam left click
the combat isn't so bad once you have higher skill in a weapon
same for the magic effects
end game it's rediculas
I do think that Skyrim will be pretty cool though
like flying around jumping into the sky
I like flying and teleporting about
stuff like that
but I never get very high level
I think highest I ever got was like 22
04Question: Does anyone know how I could find my Wii's console number?
i played that game some years ago
all the way trough
end game was way to boring
tbh that game is all about the story/ role play
/me 7shrugs. :/
nothing else really
I like exploring
7I wish DreamMagma was here.
I'd tell you but I sold my wii XD;
best I can say is go to wii settings, it's in there
which is why I like the mod I work on (Tamriel Rebuilt)
7I've noticed different pokemon, when you meet them at Entralink, have different animations.
7Natu spins around and around. O.o
the name is something of a Misnomer as we're only working on getting the mainland of Morrowind in
but it's still a heck of a lot of extra terrain, interiors and quests
Hurry up and do everywhere else!
I'm pretty sure we're intending to only do Morrowind
other projects have taken up the mantle for other provinces
Hurry up and do everywhere else!
04Dammit
imma start up the CS and do some work on the bits I'm currently making
I should also get this big box of coke into the fridge
I should totally do a livestream of me doing some CS work at some point
that kind of thing is possible, right?
06Yawn

I mostly dislike their hardware products becuase they're responsible for the "I swear to God I will kill these morons" XBox players... also known as modern teenagers.

Yo
Not too much
just signed onto faceboook and saw that link of yours and I was interested
today I found a pikachu pez despenser
yayy
:D
and my mom found this old neopets toy but it's like brand new
I was just about to tell you about the pokemon thing I got today!
we went and looked at value village today--- OOOOH
but yeah
I got one of those DS sets with the stylus, the game case, and the screen whiper thingy
the stylus's are cool
oh cool
there are two of them, one with ho-oh and the other with lugia
do you have a toys r us near you??? they all have huge pokemon sections in the front over here
I got lots of snivy things :D
I do, but the closest one is an hour and a half away
D:
we sell Pokemon stuff at work
I'm tryigg to work up the courage to ask my boss if I can buy one
:P
XDD
well if you say you wanna buy it and not just take it for free I'm sure you can
yeah, people who work there have bought stuff before
but you have to go through a whole process of arranging it
...D:
since we're an online store and not a regular one
and I have no idea how he'd react to me wanting a manaphy plush
:P
XDDDD
now if it was a star wars toy I wanted it'd be different
I found a togekiss plushie at toys r us one of the last few times I went
he understands star wars obsessions
last time I went they had these awesome stress balls
that looked like all the different pokeballs
yeah they still have those at mine!!!!
I got a friend ball :D
dari has a good point
I bet that's what dari will say when he starts to buy ponies
oh yeah could do that
or say it's for my girlfriend
:P
I'm not going to buy ponies...:P
I think he'd believe that my girlfriend likes cute little japanese monstertoys
OH NEOOOOOOOOOOW
But somehow amazingly funny.
actually today at value village I saw a rainbow dash book and I got excited for a moment but it was the old version :(
Also the chat was way too fast, 150 bronies watching it. XD

I did post a picture of me.

03I wish IRC had <spoiler> tags xD
03I mean, you can type stuff 3,3like this3, but who's going to take the effort to do that, besides me :|
12drf curiousity killed the cat
k back
LOL WTH
12if you told me there was a spoiler in there and i didnt' want to look
12i'd look anyway x-x
03yeah I know
03but that way people who genuinely don't want to know
03can't blame you
03XZD
03*XD
03because I seriously had like 3 parts of Portal 2 ruined for me by TST >_>
LOL
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT
this website that I go to where people post random stuff
One of tghese days I'm going to do the Cave Johnson lemon rant in public
someone posted it when they realized their neighbor does this every morning
03Good job breaking it, hero.
XD
03*WB02(Articuno02)03WB* - <Zoroark> 12So what? It's ok to bend the rules at times
03woah hi
12Hi ^^
03either you're up early, I'm up late, or both
if my neighbor did that every morning I would probably never be able to take them seriously
ever
again
12Yeh I'm up stupidly early on a Saturday >v>;
03LOL
03yeah
and then you'd film it and put it on the internet
maybe he's trying to be kickass
03well I've got a friend coming over later ^^
exactly
03I should prolly get to bed soon so I'm not sleeping in until 3pm

03we've been best friends since we were like 8
03oh, and Arti, I got new monitors ^^
031080p ones
well apparently he plays black eyed peas music loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear when he does it so he must be
03but thanks to them being LED backlit it's like STARING INTO THE SUN LOL
I think
I GOTTA FEELING he's on drugs
12Wow
12Awesome!
I mean I DON'T see how it's badass, but for him maybe
:P
must be
03though there's some crap to work out
12I want LED screens
3Video: S211HL (Analog) on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 SE (1920x1080x32bpp 60Hz)
03like how that says analog
03I'm using DVI >_>
OH
12Lol
I want combustible lemons
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THAR
03and supposedly these monitors do 75Hz but... it's not letting me actually set that
took me a second to catch that
12Well apparently LEDs are easily on the eyes when playing dark coloured games
03so I'm thinking I'll just remove all my video drivers and reinstall them
03well
...wow :P
good one :P
03yeah, so far the colors have been really good compared to my old ones
12How much for one?
03I have the brightness at 25%, when I first turned them on and they were at 100%, OMFG
03$130
0321.5"
03which is the smallest they make 1080
12Awesome!!
this is what someone suggest the person who posted this video should do
Step 1: Zip-line.
Step 2: Ninja costume.
Step 3: Zip-line into his yard in ninja costume.
Step 4: Make his fucking day.
03the only thing I'm gonna have to get used to is how light my IRC color looks on here
03I'm used to it being darker due to a crap monitor
03my old one had a 500:1 contrast ratio, this advertises having about a million to one
wtf
Why is there a strand of cat fur on my pants
03who knowsxz
03-x
12I can't think of cats without thinking of Nyan Cat XD
03LOL
03I listened that to about 20 minutes

XD
03I pretty much get all my news regarding copyright crap from Digital Video Forums
12We get it from Fark
12Which usually gets it from places like that lol
03holy crap
03Leaked presentation slides reveal that the Xbox 360 is about to get its next major update on May 19, dubbed the "Spring Update". The Xbox 360 dashboard often gets a major update around this time of the year, hence the term "Spring Update", but this latest update may not add as much as gamers will hope for.
03The major feature in this update, and the only "user facing" new feature, appears to be PayPal supported, tentatively linked to Microsoft's recent purchase of Skype (both Skype and PayPal used to be owned by eBay). Gamers will be able to use PayPal to pay for all their gaming services in the future.
03Being able to use PayPal will actually be REALLY USEFUL for me
03Not included in the update is Avatar Kinect, which is launching separately on May 27. Microsoft also recently launched Hulu Plus for the Xbox 360, and before that, Netflix Kinect support. <- OK Avatar Kinect wtf
12OMG yeh ovO
12I <3 Paypal
03I like video kinecting with LL without having those silly avatars in the way :P
12lol
03finally, extracted all the audio from Portal 2
03let's see how huge the folder is
033.22GB LOL
12OMG
03yeah um... I don't think I'll be uploading this in its entirety
12How did you extract it?

and he was finding me a place to stay
04Dear god that must have sucked
until my dad arrived
and basically it was like

Me: I'm paranoid though
Hensh: If anything bad happened to you, I'd be upset that I didn't do it
uh
-bad
04LOL
made me lol so hard
04HAHAHAHA

I am hax. Yes, you are right.
yeah
I am a human. Nice to meet you, hax.
Nice to meet you too, human.
What is it like to be a hax?
It's...enlightening.
That's a cool thing to feel, elightening.
It's kind of fun to be a human being.
Right.
Even though we can't fly by ourselves, our highly intelligent minds can build things to solve all kinds of problems.
For example, as I said before we can't fly by ourselves.
Ah, highly intelligent. So that's how the beings themselves put it as. I understand.
In 1903, the Wright Bothers built the first airplane into the air.
Goldfish probably think they're intelligent, too.
/me hides
But they have such short term memory they forget they're intelligent after 5 seconds.
Goldfish actually have slightly longer memory than that.
I heard the same, but it's actually a few minutes I think
I can look it up
Forgive me for using Wikipedia, but here's something on it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish#Intelligence
Well, they forget they're intelligent after that time frame, then.
Eventually

My point stands.

Go on any big Pokémon forum with a large amount of UK users and mention either 'Gazooki', 'Kinneas', 'VGC 2010', or '512 EVs on Giratina'. Sit back and watch as people argue whether Kinneas was robbed or he deserved it for getting someone else to hack for him (strangely enough, the culprit seems to get away with it for the most part). <- What's this about?

04You can be intimidating NS, because you're so blunt.
06pft
intimidating != scary though
okay
that's kinda not true
but I'm not scary on the Hensh-level

06It's kind of sad that people being blunt is "intimidating" nowadays
yeah
Agreed
04Yah
Random fact of the day: I was born in the same city as the lead singer of Paramore: Meridian, Mississippi
04Awesome
04Haley Williams.
Yup :3
04Spelling?
I think that's correct
04k
04Paramore is cool
I was born into the same world as myself.
That's pretty awesome.
Totally makes sense.
What world is that?
04I was born into a hospital.
04Amazing isn't it?
It is.
i was born out of my mother
Wait, you weren't born in an airplane?
04No, I wasn't. Weird isn't it?
It is
Wait Drake, you weren't born stupid? Damn, then how are you still smart?
If you were, where would you be considered to have been born?
/sense
04XD
xD
I have logic.
04I would have been born in Flight Number J367
/me shot
In a hospital...
06I was born like any Norwegian. On a polar bear with skis on my legs
Except for the ones born in a car, plane, or any other place.
06The ironic part is that I can't even ski so
06:D
/me dies
04XD

LOL
[21:25:23] <Drake> I would have been born in Flight Number J367

you'd be born on flight 34

I do that all the time

o_o
12thats how it broke XD

I've broken roller coasters by taking pictures of them.
I try to keep backups...actually I don't
:x
12I have a one click backup restore system, but it's failed today when Ineeded it most :/ so I'm onto Support
Also thanks for adding the DNSes and such XD
Ah :|
What do you think caused the problem?
12No idea, was in the middle of a transaction, cancelled it, then nothing would work after that. XD

Hey SS! =D

I have no idea then
although, I haven't broken SMF that much to have to ask for support
06oo
12It's not SmF that's broken ovO
o_O?
12It's my one click restore module on Cpanel XD
...oh lmaaaaaaaaao
12See this is why we need a new server
I have a few
12I hate having to rely on support
You could also probably ask drf if you could use his IRC's server website thing
12Nah we've got a new server
12it's just installing and configuring CPanel etc. takes ages
12But when we set it up, we can fix anything that breaks instead of having to ask the support people
yeah cpanel takes ages to configure
whmcs is worse though
:x
/me wishes he understood more about computers and servers.

/me lets chuck norris pwn pattyrick
I can change it so it gives you a Syntax: !fight [nick] or something when you just type !fight
instead of using the command on you
it'd be a hell lot of easier and would reduce the script by about 60 lines :x
Ok
dunno, no one ever gives me feedback or suggestions
so I don't know what people want :x
/me stinks at using IRC commands and cannot provide decent feedback :/
delete everything after "stinks"
/me runs
lmao
you don't need to know IRC commands lol
by feedback I mean what you want, what I could improve, etc. etc.
nothing technical
Ok
Umm....
wtf
Let me think....
since when did I have a !rickroll script
What?
/me deletes
!rickroll
!rickroll
What does that do?
uh
PMs you the lyrics of the song

!rickroll
I deleted it
Darn
I have no idea

It's up to you though
12It's ok, but thanks

heya `
How're you?
aaaaaaaaaaaargh joomla, die in a fire plz
the WYSIWYG default page editors are so annoying
I'm fine, you?

/me ~NP: Rise Against - Help is on the way

heya Quan :3
damnit, why am I not asleep
you use joomla too?!
i have it fo my dad's his sites ;.;
TST uses joomla too lol
ew.....
lol
and joomla can be the most annoying thing ever
it's quite powerful though
when used correctly
12It's the best CMS.
better than wordpress imo
12TST used to be Phpnuke
12now THAAAT was bad
phpnuke
12and wordpress is more limitede.
12-e
mfw
wordpress is crap
12Whats mfw?
drupal is okay
mfw = my face when
12LOL
12A looooong time ago!
XD
12Even paid for the GOLD version of Phpnuke
12That was just as bad
.______________.
<- never paid for anything
technically you could code the website by hand and do with that
but when you need to update menus etc.
:x
12Yeh that's just it, I'd rather have all my content managed
yeah...i need to update my menus! let's go through 60+ HTML pages to change it!
Oh no, I typoed! Let's go through it again!
/me Now Playing: PokéRemixStudio - Pokémon R/S/E: Legendary Trio Remix 2
:3
12Where there's always SSI or Php include but it's still a pain XD
true
but that requires effort
12yeh
/me hides
or time....
and there's always the possibility of more bugs
i normaly update my dad's site once a month, if joomla does co-operate.....
as your code usually isn't tested for bugs and possible security holes
you need to know how to use it properly :x
joomla is powerful when you use it correctly
i know.....
/me whistles

03I remember reading somewhere that because Firefox is so popular, it's actually more vulnerable than IE LOL
For some reason Opera feels smoother than Firefox on my computer
Even though Firefox is supposed to be faster

OK guys
Opera, Firefox, Chrome
Which do you choose?
Chrome and IE derp
/me hides behind flame-proof shields
Pro blem?
I'm torn between these three
Chrome is great but
03Firefox
03I HATE the GUI of Chrome
Don't baww
extensions don't work everywhere, like gestures
03and Opera is just too f'ing slow
Pfft ;p
03it's quite bloatware
03@ Opera
03LOL
Haha
Chrome's UI is strange
03I use Firefox 3.6 as my primary browser, then IE as my secondary.
03IE is actually not that bad >_> <_><
03*<_<
Opera is a bit bloated, yeah, but I disable most of the features I never use

03there, that should do
And stop bawwing about the GUI
Or just use the extension that makes it look like IE :P
03LOL WHAT
03there's an extension that makes Chrome look like IE?
Yeah, I have it
03pix or gtfo

03Sorry, we don't support your browser just yet. You'll need Google Chrome to install apps, extensions and themes
No duh

Or will you baww ;X
03uh'
03HML
031. That still has that annoyingly huge color bar at the top
03and 2. It seems more like IETab to me
03as in
03rather than changing the GUI, it's just running IE inside Chrome
HML, not liking it, sorry
03which... defeats the purpose
03just go use IE
You know what
XD
IE9 interface
Chrome's speed
Yeah?
03IE9 :/
Firefox's flexibility
03They ruined it
038 was the best one IMHO
Opera's tightness
Ie9 was a letdown, sorta
03yep
That
That'
kjbes
THAT IS WHEN eveyone loves eachother
There should be a web browser with all of that
Then we won't have to choose
Oh?
Which isn't going to happen ;P
03yeah
03he wants to use Firefox's backend to make an entirely different browser
03with no bloat and whatnot
Nice
Tell him to program a native Windows interface in
03LOL
I hate the Firefox XULRunner interface
03the name sounds familiar but I'm not sure what that is
There was a version of Firefox for Mac that used Mac's default interface
I hate all of FF's interface ;p
Can't remember it's name

that's worse than me
I just have ponies on the mind because I've watched it a lot recently. :P
:P
*your
You still haven't watched the others?
nope
The people are disappoint
sorry the people
Your vote from The_People is in jeopardy. XD
and that vote is necessary!
okay fine
I'll do it
one episode a night until I've seen them all
would that make the people happy?
:P
Maybe
Lawl, I wonder if your rivavl candidate Nyan can match that.
worth a shot I suppose
doubt it
Nyan can't even measure up to such campaign promises
We should break the news to SF that most of their moderators are bronies. :P
I bet the reaction would be lulz-worthy.
lol
Just RDX and SR who aren't
Well, I don't know about SR
but he doesn't /seem/ like he'd be one
NEVER KNOW
maybe he is
That would be hillarious.
that would be sooo funny
you're visiting ponychan and he says something that gives him away
you reply "is that you SR?"
"Uhhhhhh... I have to go"
It's not me
I posted once on ponychan
as anonymous
if so it might've been me posting in my sleep
I think it was someone else.
Lawl.
Not to mention the brony I saw saying "Kekekekekek"
haha
Also, SR's pony-sona's cutie mark would be a computer with a laser on the screen
XDDDD
that would give it away
LOL
:P
mine would be a TIE fighter
or an Indiana Jones hat'
RDX's would be the Coke logo
XD
dari's is a monocle
Yeah. XD
because I just know this
it actually is a monocle?
XD
lolno
nah, I made that up
I don't know what mine would be actually
Also, have you seen this GIF before? http://arch.413chan.net/Apple_Bloom_-_Cutie_Mark-(n1297311330037).gif
I'm still a blank flank ;__;
BLANK FLANK XD
that's epic
ahh, scary
Don't worry, there are lots of talented blank flank ponies, Sapphire Shores for example. :P
blank flank is epic
I think that was her name.
Sapphire Shores is? o.O
wouldn't hers be like music notes or something?
Yeah, if you look she doesn't have one.
weird
is derpy a blank fank
*flank
Nope.
she has bubbles
Aww, too slow.
XD PERFECT
don't ask me what that means
OOOHHH BUBBLES! MY BUBBLES!
she's the derpy bubble fish from Finding Nemo
he was awesome
lol
"MODS ARE ASLEEP, POST PONIES!"

I've never seen a cat throw up before.
It looks like milk.
I see a cat throw up at least once a week when I'm home
/me licks.
hehe
:P
oh peaches
"thats what happens at most? college parties. Fights and puking"

yeah
Not sure where that question mark came from
that always happens when copypastaing youtube quotes for some reason

LOL, related video, cat that likes to watch the toilet flush. Looks as though it's thinking "OH MY GOD! THIS IS MAGICAL! AGAIN!".
David after Dentist: Kitty edition
