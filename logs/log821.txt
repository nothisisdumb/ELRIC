As long as there's no hating on a pony from the Mane 6, I'm fine with it.
*head exploted*
i ma going to draw my thing
There should be more polls that are, "Who is the best pony EXCEPT Twilight Sparkle?"
/me falls asleep
Twilight is most likely going to get most tropes
i dont have a favorite pony
equally
Is there a trope where "the main character is loved by most of the fandom"

lol wat
wat is a statement. a statement of i don't even
yes, that
but it's not a questin in that case
I know
I know
as far raise this barn, I think it's too awkward to try to make it sound like racist barn because of the last syllable
songs*
I'm not whining
not you, silly
Oops

I'm too caught up in this post talk
post talk?

aah
hey Neo
Great I ruin it with dreadfull spelling just as I approached the end of my dramatisation
text*
Hey guys
hiya
how you doin?
Hi
That comment is a great example though, in comparison to the song lyrics being the way they are. It was simply a matter of perspective, meant to be humorous. I wouldn't think on it to much.
myes, I can't hear it, but it doesn't bother me
I hear it only becuase it makes me laugh.
no clue
he should of falcon punched them
because it was convenient for the plot that he didn't
He was never here.
still
stupid
in other words, lazy writing :P
oh great
lazy writing
hence why moleyair got caught
Ever
why not exhumor?
*frollocking
he wasn't caught
:P
also why pirates?
*searching
>.>
they dont serve a purpose
ugh krome studios
yeah they do
ur lazy
other than they're the same enemies
wurds*
as the apes
*potato
:O

JUST CAUSE 2
all hail the stream
Its like my cat nip.
Who's streaming?
If you mean why they used pirates instead of apes, I don't know then
yeah
Awesome people
oh
I have never used this games benchmark
Oh wait. Yeah I have.
The hd quality :O
yeah
also blundertails arent hard
Don't know if it was significant to the story though
as every1 thinks
they're easy
compared to executioner
and ravage rider
Woooo shit is blowing up!
Spyro isn't meant to be realistic, it's meant to be fun :P
still
its like oops fainted
oh hey diff place
It's probably in his head or something

Unless it's not even pulled out
If it were a bass, then the body would be larger than her.
Due to mathemetized pony sizes

wat
pinball machines
Hey everyone. :)
Are awesome.
I need 30 pinball machines
dammit, 3rd time I fell asleep in my chair today
Well, it's time to get packed up to head for home. The kitties are gonna be glad to see us, and they'll smell our folks' dogs, I hope.
I had a terrible night
and still have shit to do
I say just a couple of minutes
maybe youre right
I can't speak for anyone else but for me just laying down feels soooooo good sometimes
screw it, brbr gonna take a 30 min nap
That is all I need when I get sleepy is 30 minutes, or even a couple of minutes.
Whole week
dude
that's bad
Oh, gosh, that isn't much sleep at all
Yeah, I guess I have to sleep more
6 hours would be understandable
it's also good to wake up early
and have some good breakfast
HAha breakfast
Pft. Overslept. I was oversleeping when after week like this woke up at 6PM
Haven't had breakfast in years
And some hot sauce maybe...
oh, cool.
Hot sauce?
Time zones baby
It helps if you're in the right time zone
you know, out of all the food I have tried, I never tried an avocado
oh, okay. But with me, I do like to try all sorts of foods.
http://derpiboo.ru/194608
oh, right now I mainly write poetry, but also I am currently working on a story. i am stuck on Chapter Five though, I got Writer's Block for the time being
I suggest giving Fimfiction a visit
Fimfiction or fanfiction?
http://i.imgur.com/shdVa.jpg
Ethier or
My browser crashed
I know how that is.
No one likes those
And I mean NO ONE
Of?
oh, okay. Well, then I would have to exclude my character then.
Oh
I need to get off my lazy butt and write the next chapter
i'm like "oh i'm gonna be producitve today!2
"
and < happens
one*
Yup
Or anything like MLD
Naw. Just make sure it's nothign contrived.
Humans in Equestria
they want to open an "alternative youth centre"
Still no
Wait. It's going somewhere.
oh, okay.
of course their request was denied, in reaction they occupied a school
Children in equestria are BARELY done.
I read some fanfics on fanfiction where the child is usually a girl, and i like them
Whats going on guy's?
Hi there DoctorDoctorWho
We talking about fictions
I did
oh, okay.
pony*
Which they should.
Humans=evil
The reason I asked child though is because my character from my story I am writing is a young child.
Too much of the same.
which is a pretty acurate description
Mary Sue=bad writing
lots
A word of advice
There is one fanfic that touched me, and that was a fanfic about the CT shootings, it wasn't bad or anything, it was just the mane 6 talking to the people of CT
I have read fics where that happen
Eww
ikr
Well, if I do a HiE, if i do, I won't pair my character off with any of the ponies.
Anyone read Milking the Milkmare?
You milk a pony
MILK
^
MLD pushed it
MARY SUE INBOUND! http://web.archive.org/web/20070808050826/http://www.salon.com/comics/comics4961223.html

Hello
Same heremy parents used to have an adult section in the movie store we owned.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Episode Revealed: "Just for Sidekicks"
hi
hi
.
helluh....
Welcome to the island
A.K.A. Total drama island
:P
me 2
total drama island was ok, but the rest of em were not neccesary
NO TURNING BACK NOW
Total Drama went downhill after season two.
.
yes it did, unfortunately....
I'll never forget the episode where Heather loses her top though.
it had more seasons then 1?
:D
yeah :(
Harold: "Booyah..."
total drama world tour was great
here only season 1 aired
:O
SpongeBob.
no
just
...no
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pony Comic Variants at Hot Topic
Season five had its moments.
have there been more than 5?
lawl
But you just can't beat SpongeBob seasons 1-4.
Dutch voice acting.
Yes I find it freaking Hilarious
IT IS TERRIBLE
Seasons six-nine of SpongeBob have been awful, though.
Can't be as bad as current swedish voice acting. =(
you do not want to hear ANY good show in dutch voice overs
or Movie
The last "awesome" SpongeBob episode was the one where Krabs retired and the Krusty Krab was reformatted into the Krabby O'Mondays.
that is just terrible
Hey, the SpongeBob movie fucking owned.
^
Agreed
yeah same here
Three words.
GOOFY.
GOOBER.
xD all my yes
hey
it can
example
they use
OR dutch germans
or belgium people
i just learned i have another 60 hours to play through on persona 3
i didn't even know there was a italian opening
just an example
omg:O
its beautifull
^

Avenged Sevenfold NICE
uh
NO
d
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKNmrMjI_dM
f*
that was the latin spanish opening.
but gtg
And as for WORST SpongeBob episode...
/me shudders.
The older one, the one where they do the old Loony Toons donkey joke
The WORST episode of SpingeBob I have EVER seen is...
ATLANTIS SQUAREPANTIS.
That was one hour of sheer pain.
I don't recall Atlantis being that bad
^
YES
I don't see how it was any good.
Gonna loop the italian intro until i get off of work now
I've only seen it once, I don't remember it being that bad, just there
/me rolls eyes
Every good thing must come to an end...
cartoone network died 6 years abo
ago*
cartoon*
barely
Well My little Pony has been revived throughout the years/
Especially since they revived Toonami and Cartoon Planet.
Dexter's Laboratory is sheer win.

Maybe they plan on making more with Apple Jack?
08,01i don't know why it was in there
08,01it didn't add anything to the episode
08,01i blame hasbro's meddling
Also, this: http://i.imgur.com/ioosZ.png
My phone wants to go to no mans land again
The first and last of Applejack songs
08,01it sounded like a song that was just there to fill up a soundtrack CD
08,01to appeal to younger viewers
Saturn: again, the studio hates applejack
hahahaahaahahhahaaahahahahaahha
This show is meant to appeal to young viewers Saturn
the phone wants to go to Lil' Joey'
does anyone here play magic the gathering?

http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535
It was an excuse to finally give her a song, that's it
Saturn: of course they hate her
because I was going to say "wat"
but for some reason I said "wut" instead
lol
08,01Bronysith: okay, that just doesn't make sense from just about every perspective i can think of
00,02^
but honestly, a song appearing out of nowhere to steal episode time... I felt like this with both songs in the Premiere too... well, one reason I didn't like the S3 Primere anywhere :/

08,01the answer, that is
08,01it's always somethign nerdy or related to hacking
Saturn: wha is that?
i guess something with strike
08,01hahaha
ohhh
08,01counter strike
i don't get it
I was right...
/me is getting nuzzled :3
His work is just fantastic.
Saturn I don't mind, but let me alive!
08,01cloverfields
"Let me alive?"
ok... I have no clue about this
HEIL SPELLCHECK
08,01Lil_B: do you mind if i hit on you next GalaCon? o///o

08,01yay
/me 08,01jests
I'm rather looking forward to tomorrow's A-movie. :)
08,01which is nice
Saturn: those are all IT nerds, aren't they?
08,01Eli: aye
08,01it's a hacking conference
08,01Eli: apparently not

Everything in the past hour
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w3EagFXLx3Y
you don't remember when that happened?
You were on spyrochat once and we told you all the wrong genders
hello

a lot of these are lost in translation to engrish
uh grand canyon
I remember that
lol
oh that
I think that are Pictures of Till Schweiger
Not the most filling of dinners
Ok, the Movie Titles were managable, but these ones are too extreme for me
I mix both
goooood it's not jakie chan
how do they not recognize Bruce Lee?
Hi
What's up?
picture of Bruce Lee "Is that Jakie Chan?" -.(\
I think the most nerdy thing about this is that they are having this at 1:30am...
that would be epic. i'll watch out for it
yep
my best friend is over at my plaace for silvester, and he loves him too :)
ein Ess-cape... epic
08,01this is fun
/me puts Saturn in a blanket
mmm... ok, need to PM that...
/me 08,01snugs the blanket
yeah :)
I actually got a Present for someone in the UK, a copy of "Dinner for one" I heard it never ever aired in the UK
i haven't sat with my family to watch it for years tho... don't even know if they have an accent anymore
hi everypony!....how are you all?
*GASP* Baby Applejack!

pantomime translated to phantom... ouch
08,01i'm thinking of buying a bottle of this for my boyfriend's birthday, if i can afford it: http://www.williamsbrosbrew.com/beerboard/bottles/fraoch-20
08,01english is a bitch of a language
08,01Dutch is quite easy
08,01German is moderately hard
Saturn: actually I find english quite easy compared to any other language i know more or less
08,01Punkie_Pue: english
08,01i'm from Scotland
I heard Russion is rather hard, and the most hard language to learn would be icelandic
My english teacher is from scottland
Do you know any other languages?
08,01German and a bit of Dutch
08,01and even then, i wasn't all that fluent in it
08,01but i could get by
Saturn: well, if you want to practice: i'm here :)
08,01Punkie_Pue: doo eeet!
Saturn: sure
Saturn: lets do a 4 way call
I was thinking the same, not being worth it.
Saturn: oh nvm then >.>
Haven't tried it yet, I'll get me some this weekend
08,01heh
thats good to know.
living in the us, i tink spanish wold be more useful.
think
would
Saturn: add me on skype if you want. can't promise i'm often online, but the name would be "eli.brony" i guess
hm
Waiting for the ratings for last week's Toonami broadcast to come out.
oh... OH xyD
>:I
I tried taking Japanese but it was a bit too much for me to handle
*looks into Lil_Bs eyes while jazz music playes*
08,01where in germany do you live, and can i come viist?
08,01Lil_B: ilmenau first, then up north somewhere
Saturn: if it's far south, you can come over. i live at the far north corner of switzerland
Saturn: :O how did you find out?
08,01(which i'm totally amenable to)
Saturn hmmm ilmenau, don't know where that is, can you show me on goodle maps or something?
ಠ_ಠ
08,01Lil_B: about an hour out from Jena, in Thüringia
Might see if I can get my forgein lanugauge course waived
Saturn when you travel North from Thüringen than you probably won't get that near to me :(
08,01Lil_B: well, i'm willing to travel anywhere
Saturn: He made VVVVVV
???
good evening :)
*puts Socks on Saturn*
The avengers is a movie
But I thought it was cool
okay :)
I'm not I'm just hanging out
Saturn well, I'm checking atm how far it would be
08,01Socks: ARE YOU KIDDING?
... I sense a Browser-derp coming up again...
/me puts on Socks
08,01he's just the most amazing man!
And you topped it off with WAZZUP.
08,01*hawking
:P
08,01he's... i don't even know, i think i'd explode if i met him
08,01he's one of my all-time heroes
That's the kind of thing I associate with 12-year-old AOL users.
Once I've had enough of Texas's micro brews, I'll tour the other 49 states, and the THE WORLD!
No offense if you are.
Come to Cambridge, I think he still lives here.
Probably :/
08,01he does; i think he still lectures at cambridge
I agree that The Avengers is a fantastic film. But you're going about talking about it the wrong way.
:3 I'm such an alchy :D
Probably, I don't check :P
08,01Cypresswolf: waht'd you drink?
All the best people are from Cambridge
08,01Cypresswolf: also, i can guarantee i'm worse
whatever, I'm just gonna keep watching the movie
08,01or, at least, i was at one point
^ See?
08,01harumph.
XD
Teri Hatcher is my second cousin and I met the mailman from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood once. :/
Saturn: and Albert Einstein went to my school. but it's not really something to brag about
08,01Eli: aye; einstein did really poorly at school
light has no mass
Saturn: he didn't
I don't really know anybody, I happen to live in a place where awesome people live.
Saturn: that's butll
08,01GabeMoist: but it does have momentum
bull*
Saturn: In case you haven't looked into it, The Grand Design is a huge tautology.
08,01Eli: one of his teachers called him a "lazy dog" in his report card
08,01SafariMonkey: i've not, actually
note: i hate our school system
There's still some Cider brews in the liqour store I've been wanting to try - and next moth - Saki :)
08,01Einstein was dyslexic
Saturn: there's many degrees of dyslexia. i have it to
too*
A lot of people are dyslexic
08,01Eli: i have very slight dyslexia, but mostly i have ADHD and PDA
Saturn: same same
Anyone have Dispraxia?
Coz I do :(
Sad tings
There's got to be a brew of the week for each year - must look that up - If I don't find it, Patent Pending!
08,01Socks: my brother has really bad dyspraxia
08,01he literally writes like a 4 year old
Saturn: actually writing about our disorders on here is kinda sad... can we move on?
Goodnight everyone! :)
XD
Saturn: That's its premise
08,01SafariMonkey: i'm not sure how seriously to take that
Saturn: Let me know if you ever decide to visit the states, specifically Texas - I know quite a few place with great local brews :)
Socks: Luna of course
:O
/me huggles fluttershy
Socks: oh you would get along well with a friend of mine
08,01life without being able to play the cello anymore wouldn't be worth living.
Saturn: It's basically a combination of that and the anthropic principle. Both of them I find to be ridiculous and ultimately tautological.
Saturn: i can't properly move half of my left hand
But mainly cute :)
evening all
08,01Eli: what'd you do to it?
Saturn: blocked nerves or something
There is no best pony it's all just personal preference
Saturn: woke up with it
08,01wow, how odd
brb
08,01Cypresswolf: sure!
Food is, biside the language, the most iconic thing a Country has to offer :)
there is a best pony
Saturn: yeah it doesn't really help when i'm gaming or writing. it's also pretty much the reason i never capitalize anything
08,01Shizuka! i had another dream about you!
08,01and it wasn't dirty!
If I had to show a guest from anopther country our local food... I don't know... Handkäs mit Musik or a Schnitzel
don't trust doors
08,01it was the most beautiful colour i'd ever seen
Saturn: Another interpretation is that the laws of nature exist outside of the universe and created the universe. But that doesn't really kelp either, as you're just pushing causality back a step.
08,01Eli: hells yeah currywurst!
08,01SafariMonkey: aye, exactly
Anyway
</rant>
08,01bierbraten, yum
08,01knackwurst
but it also depends where y<ou get it, Kartoffelsalat changes from North to South
08,01Burning|Grey|: what's that?
Saturn; i think its about the posibility of the osibility
posibility
or something
Hey guys, I finally made it back home.
08,01it gives me faith that our userbase hasn't just descended into a bunch of bronysiths
08,01:P
Saturn; xD fair enough
Streams up
Saturn: no wait i hate Currywurst. And Leberkäse. and everything
Who's streaming?
Saturn: >_><_<

08,01one of the only words that offends me, pretty much thte only thing that offends me, is the word "paki"
08,01because i was teased using it as a kid
whats paki?
Not for use in public, it's a word with a history
Like Gollywog, It is a word that needs to vanish.
Not good :(

HURHURHUR IT STARTS WITH A LETTER BETWEEN A AND Z
SNAPE KILLS CELESTIA
AND THE PHYREXIANS INVADE
wait... I thought Snape was luna's father?
08,01SafariMonkey: yeah, it was
08,01as i say, the only reason it was is because it was a word that i associate with my own experiences of being bullied as a kid
coolio
Saturn: Yeah, I can sort of understand that. (not fully, as I never went through it myself)
WHA-poom

08,01Bronysith: :(
Saturn: You went to boarding school! Ouch :(
08,01people are stupid
^^^^
^
08,01Socks: i loved being in a boarding school, mostly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Socks: boarding schools are great
Saturn: I can't even stand the idea of them, but I'm sorry you were bullied :(
08,01i'm a very independent person, and being in a boardin school when i was 14 was the first time i could really explore that
People are stupid? Or inteligent enough to make it hurt? The brain?
08,01well, 13/14
goddamn i hated middle school t~T
/me didn't mean to force his views about boarding schools on anyone else, I am very sorry.
Saturn: I went to boarding school from (UK) year 4 to 8, in senegal
It was in Year 6 that kids suddenly became a jerk to me.
I don't like the idea of not being able to get out of a boarding school. Feeling trapped in, scares me :(
08,01SafariMonkey: wow, why wer eyou there?
long time no see :D
08,01SafariMonkey: i do not, no
/me sits on Sumica's head
GOTTA GO FAST
Socks, i'm a mod now :P
walking around at the speed of DIAGNOL
Saturn: I grew up in Senegal, West Africa, until I was 13
this is MY book, and I'M GOING TO CUT YOU!
Saturn: I guess that's the basics of it. (Oh, and my mum's faroese and my dad's cornish)
lol dem doors
:D
I whip my doors back n' forth
was that a typo?
possibry
yes he is
Pixar makes awesome movies.
^
00,10meh, most the actors seemed too robodic
Socks: ill be working, i wont be able to watch high budget animation T~T
when is it again ?
/me suplexes Socks into laundry
still don't know why I was banned tbh
yay~
Pixar still makes awesome movies, despite the other kids-movie companies surrendering to unfunny potty humor and being unoriginal.
/me dodged
outside of big-K being pissed for having a bad day
/me doesn't like potty humour, tis lazy
Dreamworks has lost every single bit of its goodness over the 15 years.
HTTYD was good...
^
when's Shrek 5 coming out ?
00,10It wont effect BMN
?
THere's a fifth one T-T
:P
hello everypony
/me huggles Socks "i know that feel"
Despicable Me was also pretty damn good.
HTTYD!
Snowden: that book was fucked up beyond belief
Snowden: Da whut...
HTTYD?
SON OF THE MASK... worst movie ever.
Snowden: only japan can get away with killing people under the age of 15
Snowden: see, evangelion, and lots of other animes >.>
D=
...oh. I totally forgot to factor in that Sumica's in a different time zone from me. :P
Oh I am hilarious
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Have any Ponies Influenced You Personally?
00,10I personalt wont
or not
00,10but that wont stop me from remote streaming it
Snowden: aight, but you know, they might change cause of that recent shit that happened in america >.>
The only bad movie that Pixas has ever made was Toy Story 3.
*Pixar
Toy Story 2 was good for a sequel.
of course
u gawt a france in me!
00,10the quest for more franchising
Snowden: seriously, whats with america and shit going down? schools being shot up and all that shit T~T
/me cried during toy story 3 TWT
Cars 2 is worst
Yeah. I did not watch it
cars 2 was horrible.
i'm sorry
it was
I never watched cars 2 either.
Snowden: of course they had to shoehorn in "videogames are bad" bullshit excuse
also, IMDB has confirmed that Toy Story 4 is announced
O shit
It finished
ENDED!
00,10so I have come to the conclusion just cause 2 takes place in the island that tropaco takes place in
that was AWESOME
Done with it ended really well
Snowden: cause you know, every american is a good person but was "easily infulenced by something else to turn them into coldhearted killers, videogames do this all the time" or how about "possessed by satan"
I very much dislike when a "big movie" company remakes classics. (ie Alvin and the Chipmunks)
Alvin and the Chipmunks? Bleh.
First one was bad enough, why did people go see it enough to merit a sequel? D:<
ET
Atari
hey does any1 know how the process of corrupting cynder came about?
I like how she glides effortlessly through the trees :D
no
Everyone should buy Just Cause 2.
like did they just put her in the beam
ET is taboo
And when it finally releases...
