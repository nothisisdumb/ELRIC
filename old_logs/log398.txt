<Fenr> and he still takes the nazi monkey with him
<Zeke_Soulis> Magnetic Gunpowder what???

<CCCP> Indiana Jones is actually based off old film serials
<Gumri> For some reason I no longer have to put in a password to login. How was it to create an account again?
<StinkomanFan> That would be awesome
<Skylands> 10HML and Luna talked alot before I got to know him more

<otakon> Damn, she IS dead
<RoflBot> USE THE KIDS AS A SHIELD MONKEY!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> uhoh
<JoJo> kingqball: Oh I'm sorry bro
<Zeke_Soulis> they give a reason for the Ark, it talks to god, the Fridge did not talk to god though.
<Meanwhile> This is easily the worst few days I've ever personally experienced.
<Ninjazz> Why do you guys hate the .movs so much?
*JoJo grins evilly
<Starflash> Hai Phase4. Although I've been here for the past Ionnohowlong.

<Lunarletic> nah its just that its not allowed
<RoflBot> ya
<StinkomanFan> It'll get better before it gets worse Meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13we don't know that, the fridge may have talked to god enough to save indy's sorry butt
<pony_8631> teh .movs are stupid
<lemur> agreed
<RawketLawnchair> Apple.mov was good, the others are just trying too hard.
<Bjornfot> Gumri: /msg nickserv register username password
<JoJo> Im knot stooped!
<Ninjazz> CCCP neither did I
<Lunarletic> I don't know about APPLE though
<Lurking-Brony> The fridge was lead-lined, don't forget.
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: It bucking well better or I'm going to the doctors.
<Zeke_Soulis> That fridge was probably the best damn thing
<BronyTJ> and in the 3rd movie, indy survies falling off a cliff
<Dark_Horst> i liked shed.mov. that one was fun#
<kingqball> I KNOW I SPELLED WRONG BECuse i can't spell worth shit...FUCK YOU CAPS LOCK!!
<IngloriousPony89> Isn't it the other way around StinkomanFan? It'll get worse before it'll get better?
<BronyTJ> with no explnation for how he lived
<Dark_Horst> the other.. meh
<Lurking-Brony> Red always means poison!
<Cypresswolf> Have the Mythbusters tested the nuke proof fridge yet?
<Dark_Horst> bud shed was nice
<RoboGerbil> hot sauce
*JoJo noms IshSexiestPony back
<Lunarletic> The Fridge didnt help in Fallout there were corpses in them
<Ninjazz> Dress was the worse
<JoJo> kingqball: Whoa bro calm down, smoke one
<brony_157> I think they did
<RoflBot> yup
*IshSexiestPony hugz JoJo

<BronyTJ> all of them
<RoflBot> THAT KID IS A SPY
<Gumri> Right there we go lets see if that worked
<CCCP> opions
<RoboGerbil> not enough food in my drugs
<Skylands> 10HML didn't like Airwolf much for <confidential reasons here>, and when Luna started following him around, HML would be an ass in front of the two
<Midnight_Fyre> I'll never forget the IMDb forum for Indy 4 the weekend it came out. All Friday night it was nothing but posts about refrigerators
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Whe does he fall off a cliff?
*JoJo hugs IshSexiestPony back
<kirzstryfe> 1,3apple was ok, dress was pushing it, shed went too far, so please don't bring up shed on bronystate channels
<lemur> EVERYONE SHUT UP ABOUT .MOVS
<IngloriousPony89> Problem, StinkomanFan?
<Bloxx> Everybody in this movie is a spy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I remember the tank goes off a cliff but not with Indy.
*IshSexiestPony lickz JoJo
<Bloxx> Even Indy
<Zeke_Soulis> GOD-LEAD. My theory was that lead talks to god. And the radiation would kill him in seconds after the left the fridge anywho.
<Phase4> i've got my wii idiling on ssbb's spectate thing
<JoJo> dat trolling
<Dark_Horst> MOOOOOOOOOVS!!!!!
*Bjornfot joins JoJo and IshSexiestPony in teh nomzings

<Phase4> players'
<Meanwhile> IngloriousPony89: if my problem is worse when I wake up I'm holding you personally responsible.
<Drake> 04:/
<Lunarletic> APPLE is fine.....I always needed a daily dose of Epilepsy
<BronyTJ> i thought people went nuts for the .mov's
*IshSexiestPony nomz, hugz, and lickz Bjornfot

<JoJo> kingqball: Smoke while killing ppl on tf2
<sonicrainboomer259> its about a(believed to be)alien artifact!no wonder they added the alien,guys,so.....USE YOUR BRAINS!!!
*Randomnerd Just realized he fell for trolling again.
<Skylands> 10with a fair share of rude comments from Airwolf too.
<RoflBot> .movs are great... but its for adults
<Ninjazz> So we cant even diss .movs? I can do that, i didnt like the other 2
<IngloriousPony89> Meanwhile: If it makes you feel better, bro
<lemur> then he DID something, but no one saw where he went because of the fucking aweswome fedora!
<tgl1992> :O

<Drepy> I am in a Shed
<monsterhunter> XD
<StinkomanFan> Is it ok if I invite Firefly in here?
<Tovler> ugh. onions and alcohol don't mix

<Ish[SWAG]Pony> Temple of Doom foar next A movie
<CCCP> Saturn: fair enough
<tisaname> ILL SEE IT BUT ill hate myself for seeing it

<Oblivion> ima get inside a fridgge wehn a nuke comes

<Derping> nuke ftw
<Funkasaurus> I thought Crystal Skull was fine
<Saturn> 08,01i always get the two confused
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> both
<[GOLD]StinkomanFan> THE MOVIE WAS A DISTACTION
<CCCP> BOTH
<RanYakumo> Ninjazz So long as he doesn't end up replacing Harrison Ford within the next 10 years, I can tolerate him.
<Darf14> I rate this movie 56-46 / (8+2)0 .......wait somethings wrong
<IngloriousPony89> The Last Crusade. Best Indy movie ever
<[GOLD]StinkomanFan> NOW I HAS THE CHAT
<BronyTJ> speilberg directed it
<brony_157> Lucas
<Midnight_Fyre> RanTakumo, I once put together a huge list of things wrong with that movie. Suffice it to say, there were a lot of things bad about it, not just the fridge
<Meanwhile> RanYakumo: It's Indiana Jones. If I really need to further explain that then there is something fundamentally wrong with you.
<Saturn> 08,01oh, it was lucas
<Ninjazz> Agreed
<NullRadix> Darf14... you divided by 0...
<Ish[SWAG]Pony> brb
*[GOLD]StinkomanFan backs up into a river
<Tovler> Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. 10/10 Its so good that only want to eat it once a year so I never get used to the taste.

<Midnight_Fyre> Crystal Skull raped my childhood
*RaveBrony runs off
<PinkamenaDianePie> CreativePonyName: Clopping is a brony term used to replace clapping. Thus many bronies do it to show appreciation of a specific scene or event.
<Oblivion> that will hurt him
<Ninjazz> So wats next?
<otakon> Tovler: I can see that
<Derping> ponys ponys ponys ponys ponys ponys
