Hey.
All.

I also think I played a little of one of the first 3 at Walmart though
I've mainly played the legend of spyro games I kinda of like them a bit getter compaired to the ones I've played because I like story based games and
Games that you have to collect a bunch of a certain Item to continue sometimes loses my interest because it is hard. Plus I like the melee combat part

14...Hi
6Oui
7Aduro	Actually, that is incorrect Proof plz. Give me FULL, SCIENTIFIC proof that ghosts and demons and ghouls exist.
7Not opinion
7Not 'sitings'
7Not religious opinion
7FACT.
7Right, because scars that you could've gotten from anywhere prove it.
7Could've-gotten-from-anywhere.
Edward scissor hands slashed you.
7If you're using these scars as proof, then first you must present proof that you got them from these so-called 'demons'.
7Shit, gtg now.
7Fuckin school.
6brb
3Its because Demons Cover up their evidence
3damn
3oh well
From personal experiences, I do believe Demons exist.
3They do....
3I've met a few of them, and actually had a conversation with one....
Thats a little extreme
3.....
3....I shouldn't have said that...

4srry nothing really exciting going on here
I noticed
=P
4lol
4haha...frauderator
Oh yeah, haha
4you do that or SR lol
He did
It's part of his avatar
4ah
4I'm pretty inept with computers lol
Heh, should have seen me three years ago
4lol
4lol
4well we can always go back and take a look :P
I mean back further than SF
4ah
The site I'm talking about is blocked on this computer
4yeah I remember
4my parents would have done the same thing to me at that age lol
I don't really mind
4lol
Those things are annoying though
4I wouldn't know
Guess that's why they're free -__-
4most likely lol
4Don't really care seeing as how I have much more important things to attend to that don't involve a compute rlol
=P
Like my calculus homework, for example
4haha
I'm going to regret not doing that tomorrow, but oh well
4I never got that far
No school tomorrow
4vacation
4?
No, choir contest
We're missing most of the day
Yeah, I've been in choir since like 3rd grade
4hm brings back memories
4I was in it up until about 10th grad
4"grade"
It's fun
4yeah I have to admit it is
4good way to relax
My choir director is awesome
Haha
4yeah all of mine were crazy lol
4including the band teacher
Must be a job requirement
4oh wait....same person lol
4and in the school I went to yes it was lol
I'm really getting sick of Ayumi
4what's he doing now
He keeps harassing me on deviantart now
I blocked him, but he's still replying to me somehow =/
4hm
4freaking hackers know how to get past all that junk
4one of the reasons I stayed off DeviantART
nah, Ayumi's no hacker =P
4you never know
Unless doppel helped him or something... I dunno
Yeah...
I guess I should just not reply and he'll leave me alone
It's tempting, though
4maybe
"Damn, you are such a whore you know that? lolololololololol. To tell you the truth, I no longer give a fuck about Spyroforum or any of you punks."
4.........
Right after he said "Please let me back on Spyrochat. I'm sincerely sorry!"
Or something like that
Riiiight, that's believable
Haha, yeah
Yahoo had a picture of him; he looks like he could beat me up pretty easily if we met irl =P
4well
4Needless to say around me that wouldn't happen
Hello
4I really do hate people like that though
Peace
Yeah, me too
I wouldn't let him back here if he paid me

That was annoying
I came back right after Doppel got demoted
And wouldn't stop whining at me about how he lost it =P
4his own fault
4don't be a complete moron
Haha
4go ahead and complain about it
4nobody to blame but his own idiocy
Now back to Mardi Gras.As I was saying earlier, people don't just go to get fat(ter) they can go for a good time to you know.

I had a huge argument with him over PM about whether my brother was memberating or not once
Kind of just kept going in circles
4I had a political argument with him
Oh, I'm sure
4yeah the typical brainwashed liberal
4he "was"
"Was"?
4apparently after I got through with him his view on Democrats was vastly altered
4wow should that even be a topic?
2I hate Obama>

Maybe it's in spam.... Meh

6I REALLY DID!
4We're actually going to be the ones paying back the trillion dollars he just spent on nothing
I wish I was from the south
6but if you knew my teachers email i could actually have proof!
And I'd have the week off for Mardi Gras
4and not to mention he gave another hefty 20 million to the unions for all the loving support they gave him

6who did everyone want to win?
4McCain

I was surprised he only found two =P
6i am a republican
Yeah, it's stupid
4that's the average American
6for me it does
6it's important
4it should have had no significance to an election
4no it isn't
4what matters is what's underneath
4not outside
I think it's kind of cool that that can happen, but not if people are just going to vote for him because of his race
13Hay

O_O
xP
"Cynder then found out that she and Spyro were siblings...And promptly threw herself off a cliff"
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee *Splat*
XDDDDDDDDDDD
lol
:P
/me is writting a little list thingy called 'the 100 deaths of Cynder'
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
I like it already.
Rurik: OMG
Link me when you're done
lol
It's on the back of my mind atm. I has other things to do first
You should have made is 101, 101 > 100
It's like those books "101 ways/uses to/for..." "101 ways to kill Cynder"
That could work
LOL
XD
101 uses for a wee...... (Brainiac series)
i saw that
"Spyro headed over to the bookshop, and after just a few minutes of searching, found the book he wanted '101 ways to kill Cynder'"
By Rurik Astley.
Lawl
one of them was that it could stop a jellyfish sting from killing you or something
HA
lol
no2: Rickroll her 2829742372 times
LOL
lol
No.101 tell her to kill spyro or kill herself
ehe....*opens up a word document and begins to copy this*
hmm good point
Special as in Sp.Ed.? lol
101. Cynder gives birth to 101 spotted dragons and dies giving birth to the 18th one
O_O

the father of a daughter

This chatroom was created for the discussion of spyro, but members also like to discuss other things as well.
yeah, she has been wanting to talk to others interested in spyro

yeah...
very aware of the forum
Any other questions?
if you're looking for an actual chatroom on spyro, this isn't the place

by the producers/maufactureres of spyro games?
the copyright owners...
negative

I just had an AWESOME idea. When Catabatus is on and RDX isn't, someone should come on as RedDragonXXX and act all pervy to Catabatus. Hilarious for those watching. I'm not doing it.
Or some unpredictable SR thing.
I'll get kicked.
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Probably
Oh well....

My uber-infinite powers show by my ability to make infinite signs on the yugioh card.
i mean
unless you burn the card with a flamethrower
Yes
It's up there.
The fact that I manage to make an infinite sign proves that I win.
Becuase you can't
Bullshit. You're an idiot. I'm done talking to you.
LOL, see, you cannot come up with anything
You type up a list of profanities, then type up "owned, I'm ignoring you now" at the end.
You are a FUCKED UP person.
You swear at me, then call me an idiot, then ignore me.
That is not an argument.
That is more acknowledging defeat.
Backing down.
Then explained.
As to why I win.
DFOKN, PICK A FUCKING PICTURE.
Nice.
Yahoo: Obelisk > Slifer.
Meh

superspyro: That's very nice.
No sympathy

Yep
Our's is more fun to say
It is stupid.
not in my opinion
Not as proper
Especially with the American accent.
There is no such thing as an American accent
We have about 20 accents
None sound the same
I always hear the same annoying one.
Especially with kids.
Spyro_Master: Welcome to America
There's different kinds of accent in the UK too doot
:p
I never said there wasn't
not a good way to introduce me to it XD
no offence
To many preppy dumba**es
Most Americans are spoiled
and idiots
well there is another impression of americans i got
I cannot argue against that
but never mind
back.
its the same in the UK to, different accents different attitudes
in essex everyone tarts up their cars
I don't have an "American" accent though.

I don't really care at the moment
lol
And...
exactly..
>.>
How am I a n00b
I haven't even done anything yet
That was the first thing I said to Yahoo, when I joined.
hmm
I'll be able to tell in the next 10 minutes
Because it's not logical
?
don't go there with me and logic
I'm good at playing mind games.....sometimes
Uh but not everything is possible you know Aduro
Yeah right
Lier
Everything is possible, because anything is possible!
Yah? Prove it.
n00v
its just a matter of, "Can you accomplish it."
*n00b
Bitch please
trust me....
I live in the U.S.A.
I'm not a girl
I have every right to talk
And I really don't care
My pimp hand is way strong,
xD
n00b
Actually, you, Pikafreak, are the n00b
Sure whatever
yes she would...
a moderator
Well, you are. Can you hack in three different languages? xD
...
Wellm that's gay
she can do anythinf if you piss her off
*well
gay?
Wow
Aice's just THAT cool
you may not want to say that with SR hovering around :P
And? I never said I did anything =P
you know, I don't recall being intimidated like this when I first came in here...
Dude, a person said "bitch": <Zephyr-kun>: Bitch please
so/
?
>.>
I know
Alright then
brb, have to brush my teeth...
Geek
There really wasn't any point to prove there
But whatever
And yes
XD
I am a geek
no not you
Aduro
He is a geek
So?\
He's brushing his teeth
I do that too
I don't know
Yeah but
I brush my teeth to
Why now?
does that make me a geek lol
At 7:00
Because it's night-time
it's 10:00 over here
7:00? maybe where you live
and it's 10 where he is
Well stil, 10:00, are you kidding me
I'm a geek just because I brush my teeth eh?
lol
LOL
I thought you lived on the eastern board
8:00!
LOL
7:00am!
LOLOLOLOL
<.<
?
well that'd stupid
why are you laughing at random times?
That's why I don't brush my teeth till the last minute
Then you eat something, and you deal with it when you wake up, noob
hm
arguing about freaking brushing teeth
yeah this is sad lol
Yes he is a n00b
no he doesn't
lol
/me labels Zephr-kun a labeler
I do admit I'm a geek
Kja has the right to do nothing lol...it's just more entertaining when he does do it lol
lol
He's a n00b though
/me accepts TornWings' label
N00BZ!!11one
....
How come people are one but never talk!
Huh....
Same here
I don't have that option
but seeing as how I do have actual responsibilities they have to be reasonable
I really have no rules
yes
I don't even have to do my homework when I go home
That's why I said I'm a geek
A geek at school...
But I'm still outgoing
I've been practicing this, I'll be fine
been practicing what/
?
how old are you dare I ask
/me yawns loudly
I already told you
16
I wasn't watching
I have a plan....its already set, I'm just waiting for everything to fall into place (Which it tends to do as such for me)
I doubt it
yes
I don't know that yet
yes
I just have to have everything set up very quickly....once its begun
you know how to act in a business relationship and with active consumers
But when I move out I plan to go to live in an apartment at Seattle
yes
I wasn't asking you Aduro lol
it's very hard to get a job to begin with
how are you going to get an aparment with no money and when you don't have a job to begin with
jeez rdx, stop grilling the poor kid
and seeing as how jobs are going to be harder to get
I'm not grilling him lol
Believe me if I was this would be much worse
That's not an answer
He got a job at 13
I already have a job
do you have a job Pikafreak?
Now I am going on to bigger jobs
Didn't I just say that
Don't worry, it pays
I have 3 jobs
Psht
I work at Albertsons, I baby-sit, but the biggest one is I work at RGIS
HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE
Oh I though you meant something else sorry
working at a store takes up quite a bit of time...I know, I've worked at two before...
income=cash flow
I make 10 bucks an hour at Albertsons
I get 15 bucks an hour on baby-sitting (10 year old)
Bull sheed
I'm I the youngest here?
And I get 100 bucks at RGIS (every week)
Dude I get 700 bucks a week from my job lol
that's nothing to brag about
Like I said, I'm moving on to bigger jobs now
because if it's without a degree its gonna be about attitude and work ethic
I'm quitting baby-sitting when I get a good job, and that good job I am getting in a week
Don't worry, I got one, I made it
That's not an answer
gspyro66
shit
Umpiring and Working at AFC
according to you
eee
even though because of my conservative attitude pretty much everyone counts it as grilling
I don't care how sensitive people are
I noticed.
Rdx grilling some kid about his future
and seeing as how I have said nothing insulting then I'm fine
Bye.
damn...
..
Kay bye
XD
*Aicebo
I've heard "good" things about you
Ok?
DAAAAAAMN!
Hi
Oh hi
"good things"?
WTH?
...
Everyone said you were really easy to make mad, but I don't think that, you look nice
Guys, I'm not a bitch...:(
brb
Always a possibility
back
NO!!!
More school!
NOOO
What's school?
XD
-.-'
Seriously
People never answer me
:(
I don't belive that
*believe
w/e Rdx
...
:(
we have answered that question....I think...
lol, good answer
You can go places without school. It was much harder to do 5 years ago then it was today....but it's not the end of the world if you don't get a degree
I assume he doesn't mean higher level school
but idk
I'm talking about College
/me goes to watch the movie
It could get lower.
|Hey
Wilma was 882 in 2005
I think it went back up
but it still pretty lol
Speed of Movement: 9 knots [17 km/h]
Central Pressure: 930 hPa
215km/h winds continous would be crazeh
http://www.stockinterview.com/Images/hurricane-wilma.gif
haha wow
hm
Do you want it to get lower?
Or higher?
Well
I would say higher.
people in that area want it to get higher :P
yea lol
Would be sorta cool :P
Woah
http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/aug2007/tropcyc12.jpg
I want it to get lower, turn around, and come over the top of my house :D
Tip was huge
:O
Cyclones can be really severe too sometimes
Hail, Hamish is
:P
Hamish went by us
If you are dumb enough to stay on the coast when a category 5 is going to hit, you don't deserve to live. lol
Severe Tornadoes happen here too o.O
But steered out west at the last second :P
hahaha
I would be down the beach watching it man
Lol DFOKN.
:D
/me likes cyclones
/me likes windyness mainly
/me likes tornadoes best :D
*stunt kite
Lol
/me wonders how DragonFireOKN knew wut he was thinking >.>
bbl
tornado's are much worse that cyclones
I have magical powers
Well
in a way
:P
Oh no....http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg
Yes.
DragonFireOKN, yes, but their winds are much much more concentrated
But they cause more destruction to objects
Like houses when they get hit
Oh no....http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg
Not one tornado...
Oh no definetly not.
They're too tiny to kill 90,000 people
I have
Typhoon Tip got winds up to 305km/h
Aduro: I have
but it had an insanely low pressure
Multiple tornadoes like this http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg That isnt the exact picture, but it was multiple tornadoes
It was really severe and bad. and I mean B-A-D.
http://void.arch.usyd.edu.au/~andrew/infodevice_2008/students/cyclone/Images/hurricane-katrina-category-5.jpg You live in a city that is below sea level....and a cat. 5 is about to hit.....and you don't leave....I fail to see the logic
There's no way...90,000 people.
Where did you get that info?
well somewhere around that 50,000 mabye?
Since when does the average person have a sense of logic lol
The tri-state tornado, only 695 people were killed
But the Tri-state tornado was the worst tornado in US history
But volcano eruptions are MAJORLY different...
Volcanoes kill like....90,000 people.
I was reading in Natural Disasters.
No.....
A volcano killed 90,000 people.
Volcano- Around 90,000
Tornado- Around 10,000
The biggest volcano eruption killed 92,000.
They rarely are deadly
Most are.
Tornados NEVER kill 10,000
Most aren't
Volcanoes can ooze like soft-serve-icecream. Or explode crazily.
Good luck.
They rarely kill
The largest Volcano killed 92,000 and that was mostly due to starvation
I already said that....
:p
you didn't say because of starvation lol
Hail, you burn up every day where I live too :P
Hail thinks Tornados kill 10,000 people
The biggest single was the tri-state tornado
No I do not.
bbl
Around 10,000.
Yeah if you find a group of 10,000 morons...and bunch them together in a torando's path
....
yeah it might kill them lol
XD
To bad Spyrochat doesn't have 10,000 members
torando lol
bbl nao
lol
LOL
sleep tiem
Hail.......
we only have 2,800 and prolly 30 of them have ever used this
You said: "Tornado- Around 10,000"
Then you denied saying it....
Yea.
I said
AROUND 10,000
I know a group of Morons....or shall I say Idiots....
Not 10,000.
Not exactky.
:D
Like it?
;)
it doesn't exist hail

Mars Milkshake or Coke?
I cant have both, I would if I could
Blame him, not be.
Coke Yahooo
*me
beebeebee.....8D
I never told anyone to PM me anything.
Dari didn't do anything.
I made the card but never sent it to anyone
Either way, I want to see that card before you start sending it out to people
I NEVER DID
I KNOW
I never did anything
URGH THAT IS DISTGUSTING.
But you were apparently involved in the creation of said card
Okay, I hate that milkshakes
Distgusting?
I did.
Whatever dari
Hmm
But you are accusing me of thinking of sending it to people
Guyz...
And I don't particularly appreciate that very much
Which I never did or said I would
I'm not though
"Go, Die, Go, Go" = "Go Diego Go!"
You are
<Stormy> Either way, I want to see that card before you start 4sending it out to people
You implied he was going to start sending it.
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I never said whether you had or not
I NEVER SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO SEND IT
That's why I'm telling you guys now
You agree that I never said that I would send it?
Kja's sleepin
I never would send that
If you swear you're not going to, I'll give it back
I swear I won't
I never sent it to anyone, nor to I plan to
OK, good

Hail...stop trying to be such a wise person...
All I do all day is watch TV,play on my keyboard or drum for a bit and do my homework..
Then it can lead to *PHYSICAL* problems.
I am not trying to be a wise person.
I am just saying.
You don't want to turn out like that do you?

Remember, killing someone off does not instantly make a good story.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5ZU2Rlphr8&eurl=http://www.mibbit.com/chat/&feature=player_embedded Watch it
I'm making my own story.
I'm trying not to kill off someone just because I think it'd make a good story.
Cassire: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZI8yBlYjPU&feature=related that nearly made me cry XD
I liked the book Shiloh and the movie Hancock because they DIDN'T take the easy way to good ratings by killing off a main character.
Not that I hate sad endings, but it's seriously becoming cliche.
I agree
Not all that bad though.
LOL!
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal
hihi
When I'm thinking of killing off a character, I ask myself something.
AM I GOING MAD?!
Aw.
If it's nothing other than "to make the reader sad" then I don't do it.
I asked myself when I killed off Scaraffu
But I won't say why :D

i dont even know where you invented that word
that's just one of the rules
don't talk to me about it talk to a mod
too much effort
arghh
for such a tiny thing
is "troll" even a correct word?
if you want to start a debate with someone then just ask "Anyone care to debate?" there is nothing wrong with saying that
when you went over the line was with the communist
most of us don't care
she'll boot you
ill stay here just to see if something happens
does it have something important?
because I would warn you about certain things ahead of time before you do them if you were on here
?
i dont care that much
but the vast majority of the time we don't talk about Spyro
i know
Mods can kick/ban for whatever reason they feel kick/ban worthy.
well that sucks
Get over it.
lol...meet Dari....
You don't have time to get over it though.
well gl with that attitude
(Well depends where you get shot)
oi
youre trying to be an emo
yepa
Dari is not emo at all
far from it
probably then yes
wow guys we're all Emos didn't ya know lol
I think I'm gonna go cut myself now
Deal with it.
i never said it would be unfair
You mean wouldn't.
it is
I can't change the fact the someone is going to kill me
prove that
you would try every way to avoid the fact that he kills you
T3h0v4llu: Come over to my house with a gun and threaten to shoot me.
give me gun and flight tickets
I would try to avoid it, but crying wouldn't help.
hm
T3h0v4llu: You want proof, get them yourself.
I would cry if someone in my family got shot and died.
youll still need to provide me with a gun and flight tickets
i can pull the trigger if it helps
No, if you want proof, you provide the equipment.
Why should I have to pay for something you want?
lmao
ill still have to travel there and pull the trigger
I don't care one way or another if you have proof.
well i do
Yes, it would.
There is no price for being right.
Being right is free.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Do you expect someone to buy something that you want?
No its not
You wanted to be right
Yes i do
When you benefit too
I don't benefit.
Youre right after all then
Yes you do
No I don't.
hey Aicebo....we have quite the freaking argument going on lol
and a change to prove youre right
You want proof that I'm right.
Therefore, you can pay to find out if I am right or not.
No one here is a wannabe depression dude but you, T3h0v4llu
Well then you fail
ahh
I think you win Dari lol
But wait
yup you win
uhh
You expect someone to pay for something that YOU want. That's like saying to someone on the street "You see that flat screen TV? Buy it for me"
u all stink
You can't smell me.
ouch
my pride
*cough*
You just won the worst debate of all time award.
*cough*
lmfao
idk Dari we have had some pretty screwed up ones on here lol
DAWI
you suck!!!!!!!11111111
I suppose.
lol
but that was pretty entertaining
addquote <T3h0v4llu> u all stink You can't smell me.
But still, it is pretty hard to find someone THAT stupid.
not always lol
i can smell you
Yeah, but most people aren't this bad.
I'm afraid that's you, not me.
Nah.

I bet he comes back and says "POWER ABUSE!"
Which was the start of this argument.
his idiocy is reason enough to boot him
Yes. I agree. ^
/me thinks that there should be an IQ requirement to join the forum.
i was just about to say that....
Haha.

Lol.
They're all on there.
I checked.
Hm.
7The bans got wiped a while ago.
Well the point is that all other bans are on there, I'm not, whether it is an accident or not I'm sure we'll find out soon.
Ok, lol.
;\
4the bans all went down after the server reset
We'll see though, I checked, all bans are on the list.
4not on my list

or not lol
10how?
4good timing Ryft
/me 3doesn't know how to ping
/ping nick-here
Wtih the /
4I don't think it works with Mibbit
With*
Oh.
Meh.
Mibbit fails.
mIRC > Mibbit.
10my brain is gonna explode
3It works
4Mibbit is simple
lol
and well...
Don't like IceChat.
10whats mIRC?
irssi > all
4They are all IRC clients
4you can use them to connect to the IRC servers
10ah
Mibbit is a client, it's just basic.
4for instance
Well....I haven't actually used irssi myself
4I'm using Mibbit
4Dari is using mIRC
:)
4Ryft is prolly on IceChat
but It's apparently the best for Coding
yah
At the moment atleast
10and blue?
IRC Coding is always simple. :P
/me 3pings Ryft.
4other clients
I'm trying to just gather all the knowledge I can about networks, how they work, how to manage them, and the like.
4Everything but Mibbit
Unless you're doing a complicated socket script
10...
dar: I mean with like, perl or C++ codes
*dari
10how old is everyone here
17 lol
4 20
I like mIRC script, really simple.
3 17
It incredibly simple
.ics and .ice style is pretty simple too
13
14*
4Fresh: SR is only 15 an knows more then just about everyone
but it's somewhat impractical to learn, considering that you can't use it anywhere else
lol
Yeah
4for example
4 6 months ago I didn't know any of this shit
But still, you have to admit that having an IRC client that accepts C++ and Perl as scripting types is a pretty good idea
Yeah.
With php it's pretty simple,.
4php is easy
4hence the popularity
10and php is?
good attitude FB
I do. :P
xD
4I'm not as experienced as you are Dari lol
:P
4hence why I'm going back to school for it :P
Fresh_blood: Another scripting language.
4so in two years I'll know more then YOU
mhm
13EEEE!!!
Many people are starting to use php to make websites.
4php is good
13like phpbb?
4because it works well with MySQL
13prince-dari: no
phpbb isn't php.
4it's fast and cheap
4php is the communication
10night
/me nods
php is a scripting language.
4between the database and the site
13eh
4a very effective language
13I made a free website a long time ago from a place called phpbbnow
4oh damn we scared him off
13it's the same kind of layout that Spyroforum's got
4phpbb is not the same
4that's the forum support
13oh
4php is something different
phpbb is sort of like the bones for a forum, made in pbp, I think.
4it's the actual language
php*
4very popular with sites
4mainly because of how well it works with MySQL
I'm thinking of maybe learning some XHTML as well >.>
4Go for it
4I've been learning slowly
What's the difference between HTML, and XHTML?
Uses, etc?
Eh, not completely sure
4XHTML is basically shortcuts
XHTML is supposedly
Lol.
4a modified version
*better
Ok.
Lol
4Well with sites it's pretty simple
I did a research paper on programming languages
4just HTML, XHTML and CSS
and I was like @_@
4C++ is a bitch
Brb.
4have not tried it
Back.
4"useful"
4either way a computer is stupid unless you give it direction
he's good with the servers and i can go into the source code of a server and tear it up >D
I downloaded WAMP.
4C++ is mostly used in the software end of things
and maybe add a few functions while i'm at it
4http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/BjarneStroustrup.jpg
Pichu: I don't think you can tear up InspIRCd any more than it is :P
4anyone can
LOL
XDDD
4creator of C++
fine
Wow.
i can put it together
He doesn't look capable of doing such a thing.
if he wants to let him try lol
Point taken.
4well I don't know that
hehe
xD
4but he got into computers when someone at the local computer institute challenged a team of students to hack into their compute
4"comptuer
LOL
Exactly, people should pay me to hack them.
4he kept going until he finally got in
Looooooooooool. Wow.
4but yeah man
4computers are dumb
Pichu: Do you know Perl?
yep
How good are you with Perl?
Hehe.
very.
4the challenge
Could you look over my script?
4at least to me
It's lagging and I don't know how to fix it
I think it's Japan.
sure
4yeah but that's the freaking Japanese
4:P
Lol.
Again, good point.
no guarantees though
4they are the most brilliant people in the world and yet vent it in the must idiotic ways
Lol.
E-mail?
4seriously

No.

13no

I'm getting more fluent with C++ at the moment, still working on it
4Prince-Dari: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4VomImtzVw

4^^^^^
that seems to be going around :P

Looks like Takeshi's castle.
while (1) {
Wait, it is.
right?
/me nods
4it is
4just Americanized a bit lol
LOL
4:p
Reminds me of Wipeout USA.
4Because that's where Wipeout got the idea
Lol.
Pichu: I also got a program called "ircd-benchmark.pl" which puts a bunch of drones on the IRCd
They'll eventually ping out though, since <STDIN> blocks
"And he takes a full load from Herby, he doesn't know whether to scream, or smile"
LOL
gah
why do you use STDIN?
4lmao
For command-line input
Probably not the best setup
Stepping stones one = win
4haha
3:48 LOLOLOLOL
I don't think Perl is the best language to write an IRCd in
I wanted to try though
4I'LL WINN!!!!
I don't think C++ would be that effective with it either
i beg to differ
Hm, I think I overheard someone talking about doing that the other day
Does it?
I've heard it doesn't work well
with C++ you can have multiple threads to handle input and output
higher CPU load probably, but not that much]
and faster
Well then whoever it was must have been pissed at C++
You have multiple threads in Perl, but I can't get the implementation to work :(
Hrm
threads in C++ are simple
only thing i need to know
http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/9502/avatar4.swf
is connections with C++
Like, sockets?
yeah
hmmm
if know that, i could potentially make a server
4It says to log in lol
Pichu: You have sockets, which are connectors to other places
log in*
yeah, i understand sockets
I need to get on learning socket connections in a few things lol
you know
4doesn't do anything damn it lol
Oo
Refresh it
Works for me, and other people :p

It is possible to put software on someone's computer, which allows you to watch through their webcam.

3uh
/me 2dances
10mj ftw

Although that means either having access to their computer, or getting them to download it.

10O:
10the show's screwed
7Yeah.

7Turk and Dr. Cox are in it though, which is something. But the whole thing that made Dr Cox awesome was his JD interactions.

2I like music, it's winful
We got afterschool detentions, worth it though.
We sat down and watched the cricket.
13I like music when it teaches you something, not when he thinks that beating on his stomache is making music and/or teaching us about how verses work. -___-
2As a 'punishment'.
NO U! >:U
2Ok.
The sixth formers did loads of crap on their last day, can't remember if I told you guys or not. (last day meaning last day before all their exams)

2Whats c++?
10A programming language
2Ah
2More complicated than Welsh?
4nah lol
10It's for program scripting
4It's not that complicated if you're use to it
10Game scripting is like the Lua language
4It's also good for math based functions
10Yup
4which I stay away from
4since math sucks
Oo
10I concur
4Most do but math isn't everything
10Math was never my strongest subject in school
4Yeah it's not mine either
4Actually I suck at math
2Ehh, I'm not that good at maths
4I'll just have my sister do all the work when I take Calculus haha
10Dumb pythagorean theorems that I'll never need later on

14o.o
6eh?? why me
I had a good comment but it would only apply to a male.
14o.o
14EW!
7If she wants to keep her lower body, she won't.
14NO!
6lol
6XD
14I don't know where he's been.
We don't know where you've been.
14<.<
Abbey: Perhaps you should swallow a sword.
6XD
14Master...
7Gaiz, isn't abbey being rediculously possessive of C7??
I saw that on 1, 000 Ways To Die
14NO!
Some idiot agreed to swallow an umbrella.
6i dunno
7Here's some quotes to prove my point: "She's mine!" "*sulks*" "*kills Kja and hugs C7*" "*hugs tight*" "*goes into a corner of the room*" "D<" "You're not worthy!" "You can't hug her!"
A corner?
Dari should respond soon.
7A corner.
/me 14backs away from the crowd
?
"How many times msut I tell you, there are no corners here."
*must
Lol.
Oh no.
7Abbey, give me a reasonable response as to WHY /exactly/ you're not being possessive of C7?
The souls are awake.
Mucking.
6it dosent mean anything lol
Lol.
7Her responses suggest otherwise.
Sorry, but that made me lawl.
/me shuts it.
7"NO!" "I'm NOT being possessive!" "I'M NOT!".
14If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch and practically start a fight every 2 seconds. :P
7Me thinks thou doth protest too much, Abbey1053
*everything
7I'm not, it's just fun annoying her.
Being possesive doesn't have to be that extreme, Abbey.
You can eb possesive just by not wanting her to leave.
*be
7"If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
LOL
6right....
7claw*
Paw works too.
7Hah.
Hahaha.
7She couldn't handle the truth.
7Kja wins.
Or the button.
/me 6face palms
7... the truth. she couldn't handle the truth.
No, the button too.
6you really get an edge dont you from doing that to people?
7Just her, and people I dislike.
6theres no point its people youve never met before and all they are trying to do is talk to people
7It's no fun doing it to /sensible/ people, like you.
*KJ
6well if you dilike them keep it to urself
14X.X
6Kjakings you havnt won she came back
7To repeat my earlier point,
6no back off
7"If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
14Lol.
7People like you are what's wrong with the world. You believe everything should be sugarcoated, and that the truth is being mean.
6truth is not always mean
6ive had to deliver it on occasions
6ur just taking abbeys mucking about on here and turning it into something else
7No. But you believe that hard truth is just being unnecessarily mean.
There's that muck again.
14-.-
14Here we go, starting up another argument.
6like i said kja not always
6in this case it is
It's beautiful.
6your just turning something stupid into a non existing truth
7I didn't actually mean it until I saw her responces: a random bluff.
14Random bluff?
14Lol.
SM you mean?
7I actually said it in PM first but her randomly violent denials made me put it here.
6i wa sbaout to say lol
7Yes, I mean SM.
6are we done now ?
6lol
No, keep goign, I was about to grab popcorn.
*going
6lol
7WE are, but abbey never actually responded to my last comment.
14Neon, you aren't helping.
7Of course he isn't.
14And, I know he did.
6i dont blame her, its her choice whether or not she can talk to you
Oh. crap. 'Cause you know how I'm always trying to help.
7Right, Abbey. Remember, silence is just another form of confirmation: "If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
7I'll be perfectly able to back down, if she gives me real reasons. Most of my 'arguments' evolve from people being inable to do that.
^ That was random
7Not just something. Many things, many instances, many actions.
14Oh come on. -.-
*are on
7... I highly doubt you have anything to follow that up.
13WOO
6cause tehy are justing joking about, but apoarently you cant see that at the moment
13 42
13subbers
13bwahah
7Abbey: Yeah, I highly doubt you have something to follow that up.
12I don't.
7Are you gunna continue time-wasting, or have you actually thought of anything?
12Me.

7Not really.
13Icydragon: dude no
13XDDDDD
7Abbey: Yeah. You know how C7 exaggerates.
Hush.
14It's not an exaggeration. You just <3 her, am I right?
12It's retarted.
13I know
13It's evil
13(:
7Abbey: No, you're not right.
Wow, is it just me, or does that thing have 2 meanings?
Probably just my dirty mind.
7Dari: Hahaha.
7I was thinking the same thing.
14Oh really then?
7What gender is that rabbit? XD
Well, I'm guessing female.
13Probably both
13SHIT
7Who in god's name makes this shit?
13I'm missing dwaggy tales
14Typical.
Woo, I've finally found a program that allows you to steal other people's wifi.
7Not very imaginative. Same clips used repeatedly.
14Yes.
14But dA is when I noticed.
Dari: My dad's been doing that, lol.
7Indeed.
It's legal too. :)
Teehee.

4Where did you see that
On the top of a pepsi bottle.

"A product of the Coca-Cola factory", or something.
4yeah
4no
10lol you are gulliable arent you, Dari
4Pepsi would sooner blow themselves up then be owned by Coke
Oo
Yes, because I expect people over 18 to be mature. :P
4psst
4the older the get the less mature you get
10Its all a matter of principle now lol I dont think Pepsi would sell to Coke even if they were going bankrupt considering the history between them
Lol? Oo
10and RDX is right, I mean, just look at him
4Depends on how desperate they are to stay in business
4but Pepsi wouldn't go bankrupt lol
Well Dr Pepper is owned by coke, right?

Although, .swf extensions are blocked for avvies.

14Master
14:D
4oh wel
Hm, or you could allow them. :P
bbl
6stupid connection...
14Lawl
6why lol
4yes Dari
13yep taht one
4I already warned them once
4I think
13Well, they're still going on about it
14o.o
14Meat Fight?
14WTF
647.4% bigger.
14That's pathetic. Seriously.
You can't ignore that.
:P
13Abbey1053: I know.
14Yeah.
4Warn them one more time
6i would comment on there but they would just ignnore me when i try to change the subject
13I personally don't see the point in not eating me
13OK
14Lol Master
14aw
Where's this topic?
4Prince-Dari I'll get back to you when my family is done bitching
Ok.
Where's the meat topic?
14LOL
13Abbey1053: they go mental from not eating meat
13:P
Are you saying dogs you learn their names and commands are just "instinct"? Dogs do not hear the sound as we do, they just recognise after MANY repeted times, that when a certain sound is made, they do something, and they get a treat.
That's not clever.
Any animal can do that.
13I'd kill a baby if there were no such things as hamburgers
14There goes his connection.
13JK
14O_O
14I was about to say ._.
13:P
13I'm glad that I wasn't born into a vegitarian/vegan family
14Animals eat other animals. It's natural.
LOL
HAHAHAHA
14LOL
14xD
13They're liars.
14Indeed.
Plants have feelings too. :(
13Yep :P
14XP
13And I think that there's male and female plants
13Idk though
Well.
Milk, which is usually from cows.
13perhaps goats
13:P
And vegans don't drink milk.
14Dam
14Was about to say that.
14Lol.
13which is just stupid
14Lol.
13it doesn't hurt the animal
14Last time I checked, no-one can turn time.
14I know.
14But when it's like bear-skin etc.
13ah
But the argument for that is that you are supporting the killing of the animals by buying the animal skin clothes.
14-.-
If there was no market for animal skin clothes, people wouldn't kill animals for their skin.
14Indeed.
...Gumbo?
13at the last minute she made it vegitarian
WTh is that?
14o.o
13prince_dari: crocodile

Oh.
7Nades, RPG launchers, artillery and a jeep with a mounted laser gun. The extra weapons of Base Mode.
7Proper nades.
7and if the zombies breach the walls, you can move up a level where there's MORE supplies, a single Baretta and some extra turrets to set on the single stairway.
7Zombie Genocidist heaven.

Hey Dari
Hey.
How are you?
Irritated
Why's that?
because of the stupid Mary-Sue concept
Oh, the character has a fucking common name
ITS A DAMN NAME!
but, that automatically labels the character a Mary-sue
in writing.
You can ignore them.
No
I suppose.
Reading is supposed to be fun
Not something ridiculous
Wow.
hmm?
how does one do that, and why would one need or want to do that?
It stops people from ping spamming you.
...
Oh right.
I can't
My nose is in the way
Distance, etc.
ok
Wow, Ryft is alive.

I'll have a practice then after if you're still here I'll have another go
I haven't played it in months.
In fact, all I've used my wii for in months is homebrew.
My wii is now an alarm clock.
Or an emulator.
For PS1, Atari, N64, and...
Gameboy Colour
Oh, and SNES.
I can even turn off the safety messages. :P
And play DVD's on it.

Oo
10Why do cats always lay on clean clothes?
Why?
Ahh.
10You like Warriors?
10I'm not into it anymore
4damn you procrastination
I thought you liked just being able to fill in forms and tell people they are crap at their jobs and should try harder, or whatever you said you do.
13Catabatus: I read the first half a month or two ago
4But i still want to get paid more
Which usually means more work.
:P
10*from
10I like the first series, and that's about it for me
4Not in Coca-Cola it doesn't lol
4I would actually be doing less work
LOL
Good luck with it then. :)
13in the power of three series I mean
Books can't be sad.
When all the main characters die.
2lol right?
I need to find a book where that happens.
10I just know that Lionblazeheart does something terribly ebil
10And Jaycrowfeather is angsty as ever!
13Hollyleaf just kills herself
13at the end
10i said Hollyleafpaw earlier. I meant Hollyleafpool
10Ooooh
2brb for a while. I'm gonna continue my story on a fourum
10Woo I knew it'
13brb...
10i mean...
10Squirrelflight
10gah
10Does Jaypaw get his name change yet?
13back
13Yep
13He's Jayfeather
10Is it Jayfe - oh, I knew it
13Want me to give you full spoilers?
10Jaycrowfeather...
10Yes
13XD
13I always thought that Squirrelflight was the one that killed Ashfur but it was really Hollyleaf
13Ashfur was planning on telling everyone at the next gathering
13so they killed him
13well Hollyleaf did
10Tsk tsk Hollyleafpool
10Did this happen int he fifth book?
13he was killed at the end of the 5th
13yeah
10Ah
10Anything of interest happen before then
10Besides ShadowClan becoming heathens
13hmm
10Fun
13then the three find out the truth, talk to Squirrelflight and Leafpool about it, Hollyleaf turns angsty and hates the world, they go off to talk to their father, he doesn't want to believe the truth, Hollyleaf tells everyone at the gathering about the frauds and lies, and she ends up suiciding right after trying to make leafpool eat deathberries
13that's it
13and starting at "the three find out that truth" that's pretty much near the end of the book
13so yeah
10Nothing about the ebil Lionblazeheart or crotchety Jaycrowfeather?
13hmmmm
13Idk I read the first half of the book a long time ago
10Oh
10Hrm
10I hope they kill Fireheartstar in the last series
10I liked him in the first series but after that...
10it's KITTY STRANGLING TIME
13so yeah
13they've already got another whole saga planned
10oh woopity doopity
13and they're doing another one of those "special editon" books like the one with earthclan or whatever
13LOL

4nope sorry I mean "Native American"
4Political Correctness ftw

13The Europeans that came to Europe thought that they were in India because they wanted to find out if they fell off the edge of the earth or not

4and England was around for about...idk......5,000 years more then the US
6^lol
6yep, we have cars older than you :P probaly
6*your history
4prolly
4dude I don't know the difference between anything right now
I saw this comic strip in my history text book a long time ago. The first few pages were about Germany declaring war, etc (WW2), everyone's fighting, and you get a picture of the American's basically saying "Meh, doesn't affect us, we don't care", then you have a picture of the Japanese planning something, and the picture after that states that America has joined the war.
Did that get cut off?
Where'd it stop?
6war.
4no it's up
Oh, ok.
4at least I see it
4I can't speak for the Democratic administration of the time lol
6i can see it
Well, if he did, it worked.
4they did know
6^ lol
To be honest, I would have thought that even if we told them that they were going to be attacked, that the fact that they were being attacked would bring them into the war.
There's that, I suppose, but how would Japan know?
4who knows
4Japan had scouts all over Pearl Harbor man
You would have thought they'd stick out like a sore thumb.
4not really
4they're called Japanese Americans
6well people got their revenge with the A bombs i guess
I've seen some, they still look Japanese.
4who knows how it would have turned out
4those poor polish bastards had to use cavalry against tanks
I can't remember the figures of the battle of the
6not nice at all...
Somme.
4the Somme was horrible
6the french were rubbish in WW2
4The french have always been rubbis
4h
4want to read something cool?
6yeh ok
4hold on let me find it
Germany crushed France. Lol.
6they always do
6and the english have done that to

Wow, weird domain.
4popular though
4read it lol
LOL
France got conquered by ITALY?
4technically lol
4if you count the Romans
6makes sense
4obviously yes
4but they still come from Italy
4no
4the Normans
But Italy was formed in the 1800's, or something.
6oh yeh
6well the normans then that was it
"France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman."
LOL
6XD
LOL, they lost to Italy again!
6LOL
6"Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes refuge in a McDonald's."
6^ biggest fail ever
6ha ha

7One geography trip, a completed Time Crisis 4 (they didn't have 3) some over-salted chips and a 2 litre dr pepper I didn't get charged for (incredibly dippy cashiers FTW) and an hour wait outside because I forgot my keys and Kja hath returned.
Although last time I ended up with about 20 spinters in my arm.
Climb onto the roof.
6SF!
lol
6=D
6lolus
Gah my dang cable broke
6D;
7Dari: No, no trampoline and I don't think the shed roof can support my weight (it's a cheap roof, and the only way to get onto the garage roof)
6*D:
7The trampoline was the only way to get onto the shed roof anyway
6wtf
6DDD:
I can quite easilly climb onto my garage roof, although, I broke through the roof.
6lol
I should have just used a ladder, I didn't think about it at the time.
lol
6UGH
D=
7Dari: the garage roof is fucking high. Our garage also has a loft/attic
Still, generally, it's easy to climb onto houses.
Most have drain pipes.
Those are extremely easy to climb.
6No..
6Though I am hungry..

DS is closed
Wow, that's cool.
:/
DS open.
/me wonders why he never sees /me's any more.
7Because you don't understand the simplest things we tell you. Then when we explain, you get all pissy and take offence. Honestly, Dari, take the simple route with him if he lies as badly as this.
/me 7wonders this also.
i could wait for only a few more hours until meh dentist appointment
7I hardly ever come on here anymore, or atleast not paying attention.
Cool. "Warning! Battery is low. Safe mode enabled."

Oh, and the reason I asked if you had wifi, is because for a limited time, they are distributing a "special key" via wifi.
Uxie was a bitch to catch
And it ended up killing itself

13"I GOT IT"
No, I got the wii points one.
Yeah, I think it went unfree after April 07
Using "Star points".
ahaha
But it wasn't illegal.
You use the codes from games you buy to get star points, and trade those for wii points.
Lol.
:O It doesnt work when I say it!
either that or my music is too loud
F for FIAL
And yes, it is a script, it's just built-in.
'Mmmmmmm, ham sandwich' in the middle of a guitar solo just sounded preeeeetty epic
7"Fuck you, the song's done now."
...
oops
MJ wasn't a paedophile. :P
7Regardless.

He just wanted to be a kid. Oo

No
I refuse
Wait until I finish the story
Fine, you force me to look it up then.
if you have a DA I'll give you the link, but, I warn you, its very dirty, only for ages 18+
7No-one likes him, no-one believes he has a girlfriend, or gives a crap to a word he says yet he keeps coming back
I look it up, and it comes up with children's stories...
meant only for adults
...
There are many versions
A story about someone having sex with a bowl..?
Yes
basically
and someone walks in on him
asking him to join or something like that
only to get "Not with my ricebowl you don't"
That's not really perverted. It's just stupid.
Uh...
No one has sex with a bowl.
6Holy crap...I had forgoten that this place came to life...o.o
I know several people
Aduro: You live in America?
People have sex with beagals

Do you live in America?
Yes, why?
I rest my case.
Where do you live?
UK.
The land of the normal.
Ahh
Because you're trained like that...
...Trained?
Yes
everyone wants you people to think the same
Wrong.
We aren't "trained".

Seeya.
N00bz.
13prince-dari: I'm, CLIMBING!!!
13Why?
13What's she doing
9She is just a piece of shit.
13What'd she do
9She's already doing bad things for her body anyway
13Bulimic or worse?
9Not bulimia or anorexia
9But just as bad
13Wrist cutting? Drugs?
13Idk
9Nooo, though she DOES watch inappropriate shows
9She doesn't brush her teeth
13Smoking?
9lolno
9She doesn't eat right
9So has poor hygiene
9XDDD
9Well she waits under afternoon to eat, and it's usually lunchables or SPAM meat
13ummm
13what's wrong with eating whenever you want
9No, but she could DIE
13oh yeah she has that disorder right
http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/9/9e/Arguecat.PNG
9She's perfectly aware of it
13Maybe she's suicidal then?
9....
9Well she accuses me of
13...seriously?
13Maybe she's paranoid
9Idk
13I myself have a pretty vivid and fucked up mind
9Everyone does
13not everyone
13mehh
9Well to themselves
9I refused to make me macaroni, then she has a sissy fit and starts screaming and crying like someone dropped a chainsaw on her
9*to make HER
13wpw
13*wow
13Caillou-circus-episode much?
9Eventually I did, but put a whole stick of butter in, and whenever she asks for a drink, I dump a lot of sugar in it
9And lol exactly
13"ITS TODAAAAAY! I GOT ALL DRESSED!!! ITS TODAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
9XD
13Why are you trying to kill her though? That's...that's just terrible
9Idk
13You "don't know"?
13....
13..
9That's one of the symotons
9*symptons
13Just tell her to make her food herself if she's that starving
9Well when she does, it's bad for her
13You're not helping that much with the butter and sugar...
9Eh
9*dad
13Do you really hate her that much that you want to "shorten her life"
13awh that's mean :(
9No
9It's normal
9Daily routine
13gah.
9I know, it's disgusting
9:(
9Do they even try to work things out?
13nope.
13He tried to hide smoking too
9...
9He needs to take responsibility
13I'm pretty much screwed right now
13"They told me I had to go to rehab, I said no. No. No."
9*hugs*
9She needs to prevent him
13She can't though
9True I guess
9Why does he want to screw everything up more?
13Because he can't stop
13addiction
9I know but...
9Fuck I'm never going to drink beer
13Me either, I don't want to end up the way he has
13:(
9Did you try talking to him?
13If I do he'll get piss mad
13So I pretty much hide in the back room on my computer all day
13><
9Wow
9Maybe subliminal messages?
13What?
9Ex. If you don't like how a food taste, say 'Ew this tastes like beer"
13LOLnah...
13I had alcohol once by accident, I thought it was my soda
13it does taste terrible
13I don't see how people are addicted to it
9Yeah you told me
9Wine is good
9Beer= bleh
9Maybe people just like being drunk, and after that get used to and eventually like the taste
13Yeah perhaps.
9Maybe: *trips* "Wow I'm clumsy, like drunk"
9Video tape?
13I've already tried that
13I can't really do anything about it
9Fuckshit
9Wait, you said that he doesn't want to hear you talk...?
13he doesn't like it when I talk while he's watching shows or if I ask him anything
9Wow
13my mom's always at work
9Damn
9Btw, a couple can divorce but still live together
13they're never going to live together ever again after, they've made that very clear.
13Yes, but then there's schooling issues
9Tutors?
13which is stupid
13Not going to school has great benefits
13It's not bad
9Well you won't learn that much
13That's all I did for school the past couple years and I'm doing just fine
9But I mean without an adult
9And she won't know if you did it
13Yeah she would, she can look in the book and if there's writing in there that means I did it
13Duh
13:P
13I don't need someone standing over me to do my work
9I was about to look up Seattle schools, but then I realized that was a dumb idea
13...Looool
9"Eckstein.." wtf kind of name is that
13A name for redneck schools in Texas, perhaps
13lul
9lol it's in Seattle
13NAW
13LIES

13Stalkerrrrr

13haha JK
9XD
9Damn I suck
13There's bitches in every school, all reviews are lies
9I know
9But some are stricter
9XD
9XDD
9Hopefully I'll go there
13ya?
13*yay
9I guess
9XD
13It'll be fun
13"HAY EVERYBODY! *kickshin*"
13You're a year ahead of me, remember? :P
9Oh yeah...
13"And he should know, he's in grade THREE!"
9Sometimes they skip you up a year if you were homeschooled before, maybe it can work...
13nahhh
13I don't ever want to go to that whipping house ever again
9But you'll be safe from the outside world
13NAW
13:P

9\What happened to him?
13Idk...
9He left and took the kids
13XD
13never heard about him since
13I don't know

Which one, remind me.
9Imaginationland, with everyone breaking into Sector 2
13Crap, gotta go...shitty uncle's shitty barbeque *punches a baby* :(
9:(
Seeya Mikeh.
13Bye
9Bye bye
Bye bye bye
9She tore out my heart
LOL
9And took the kids
Dirty hag.
A millstone around my neck...
"Like a crooked, burnt-out saint I believe."
9Like a saint good at his job
I resnt that.
:P
9Sorry
Lol, it's okay.
9For now.
9And sure.
Alright, you first.
I'm a bit distracted right now.
Elaborate.
Erm, no.
It was a little bit more than that. ;)
9lol
9Well there's also the sexism
9JW?
Jehovah's Witness.
9Oh.
9But those kids were innocent.
9wait, I have it saved somewhere...
9Judges 12:5-6
9No, 42 THOUSAND
Lemme look it up.
Found it.
9So those people were enemies?
Yeah, basically.
9XD
9Well exactly with the war part: Pro-life, yet pro-war for their beliefs?
And the 42, 000 were soldiers.
Not to aention he would go to any length to protect His children while they're following him.
And pro-life most applys to babies anyway.
*applies
9But they'd rather a young man/woman with family die than a bunch of cells/old, suffering, dying man?
I hope that answered it right.
9Eh....well for you.
9You're a strong debater though
No, I mean, if it doesn't help ask me to go into it more. And thanks.
9It's fine.
'K.
Well, give me an example.
9It says it.
Show me.
I highly doubt that.
9wait,,,
Sure, no prob.
9Deutoronomy 22: 28-29
Searchin'.
OK, picture this virgin right.
9Yeah
She's prolly a young person in the context, I'd guess.
I don't really get the marrying part, I'm gonna admit I'm cinfused on that.
9And "never divorce"?
I'll find out for you.
*confused
Also, that's not really sexism lol.
9A man can have female slaves
Everyone in that time did that, it wasn't enouraged though I'm pretty sure. Like a ton of guys have multiple wives and crap, it was kind of the custom of the day. I mean, women have been jipped of their rights for most of history, it's an unfortunate truth.
9Yeah, a law was ONLY JUST passed that women get the same wages as men
Also, I think I may have found a decent answer:
Woah, sorry for that block of text.
9Well, thanks for the decent answer
9Though I doubt the husband would be a good one
*have a
9I know, but another point is that the Bible doesn't really apply to our times
Good retort. Well, take into consideration that even though this book was written thousands of years ago it has told of events that happened thousands of years after its publication.
9Like....
*don't
9Okay, when I find a copy
9I doubt I can, if my weak debates, but if you want, we can end.
9*with
I'm jsut trying my best to answer them/
We'll end if you want.
wtf
Except for babies, since there's an age of accountability you know.
Lol

13Shadowsfall: They released one in January, they're not going to have anything the same year unless it's an EP, and besides, they suck now
13IMO
6I looked it up to see if my cousie finally got the lyrics of an LP song right...
They always sucked.
They are not that bad
IMO
6And she finally did...-_-
13I only liked one album
Which?
13hmm
Folie a deux? Infinity on high? Those are the only two i like XD
13Those both suck vaggie
6From their songs I only like I don't care..
Yeah
13I hate them even though I have Infinity on High I bought it without listening to any samples of it thinking it'd be as good as one of their others but it just sucks and it's like a freaking worship album
13"ALL OF THE MOTHERS RAISED DER BABEHS"
6O_O
13Worshipping crap
13plus the first song pissed me off
13etc

7God-damn, those dragons are hard to kill. Two of them versus me and my steyr AUG A1 (or whatever it was called), a team of rebels wielding SMGs and AR2s, three rocketeers, and a bunch of pistol and revolver wielding citizens.
7I tried to flee in the train but they fired fireballs at me and actually blew up the second carriage, and made the first one flip onto its head.
7Then my gmod crashed.
6o.o
14PMS again?
7shoulda just activated the gnome pilot controls.
there are dragons in gmod? 0_0
7Yes.
7I've only got the betas.
7I dunno where to download the full versions.

7...lol
I have spoken!
6Ow

6Lol
Clearly.

7P90 and dual berettas has replaced M4 and deagle in antwars
You're blinded by greed.

7I fail to see how it's not a full version.

7They need to make Archangle SNPCs to fight the dragons!
7Flies. If you get close enough to melee you get clawed, or bitten, or smashed with tail.
7Neon: No, but there should be.
Because you said Archangle.
7It doesn't swoop, it hovers.
Si I figured.
*so
7I'm referring to RoF, yes. But there's no RoF mod.

One sec.
Didn't know that, the only catalysts I knew of are enzymes, haven't learnt anything about them in a subject other than biology.
10chemistry involves a lot of catalysts
10Need any info on enzymes?
Nah, I'm good with that, thanks.
10Alright then
But are complex hydrocarbons alkenes?
You never really said, just you said that the simple ones have no branches.
Because, according to wikipedia, after catalytic cracking, you are left with alkanes, and an alkene.
10Does it actually say you end up with one complex hydrocarbon?
that*
10that would make methene which is too unstable
10Think of it like this, here's a diagram
10This is Pentane
10C-C-C-C-C
10This is Pentene
10C-C=C-C-C
10The ones in the middle have two
Ok.
Ok.
10Giving Pentane a Structure of C5H12, and Pentene, C5H10
Right.
Ok.
10Have you tried looking at the wiki page of Hydrocarbons?
Is it possible to break down alkanes any more?
10Methane is the smallest one. You can only break down Alkanes into Alkanes if you provide it with Hydrogen at the same time
10Otherwise you get one alkane and one Alkene
10What's all this for anyway?
Thing I need to write on oil.
10Is it an essay?
I've done fractional distillation, some I'm writing about catalytic cracking.
10Is it for school?
Yeah.
10I see
10You done combustion yet?
10I'd do that one next, pretty simple to understand
10How it's used would be a logical next step. Then I'd focus on disadvantages and alternative methods
10Here, have you read this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking
10http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/recycling-polymers/figures/long_hydrocarbon_sml.jpg
10look at that
to have*
10I suppose so...but I'm just guessing at that bit, theoretically yes, it would, but in practice I don't know
Hm.
6Hey
2Hello
HOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fresh_blood: By 'happy' do you mean they need 4 electrons to fill the outer shell?
Lol.

I've lost my enthusiasm for writing...
2Hey SM
2WTFADURO.
I have the inspiration
Hi
2Are you sure? No more pron?! :(
2Hahaha
just no enthusiasm
10Giving up, shameful
Not giving up
...
just pissed off
2:/
10well that's pointless
I just don't have the patience to sit down and write
10Shouldnt be writing then should you
my freaking attention span rips me away from it
i hate my mums laptop
2Someone once said to me 'never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about'. :/ It was confusing
10Then stop complaining and write
6BLOODY!!!
...
no
2GORY!!!
2Anyhow
I just need something to get me fired up
<Aduro> I've lost my enthusiasm for writing... If you like something, then you are usually enthusiastic about it.
...
My attention span prevents me from being enthusiastic about it
/me 4yawns
2Why do minstrels BURN?!!?
I HATE my mums laptop soo much
2I gathered that XD
6if u press the back key it sends u bac
/me 10pats Spyro_Master's back
It does that to me sometimes SM
2He loves writin about Dari?
2writing*
Lol.
10I think the word he's looking for is motivation, not entusiasm
I just don't have the attention span to actually sit down and write!
2WANT MORE JUICE
Damn
Why was I using enthusiasm?
Fresh_blood: Well, either that, or he needs inspiration.
10Because you're a bit slow?
10:P
Its not an inspiration issue
Oh wait, same thing, I suppose.
I have the inspiration
6lol
6thanks
6:( stupid thing
I'm just easily distracted by other things
2And I have more juice XD
10Only thing stopping me is writer's block
6hang on brb getting a cu[p
2For my juice?
Mmm. Thirsty.
/me goes to get a pepsi.
2Mmm. Minstrels.
10Good man, drinking Pepsi
Fresh_Blood: Do you have a girlfriend? Do you listen to epic music? maybe those things can inspire you
2Does epic music mean The Smiths?
2:D
No
10It's not a case of inspiration, rather a case of having other thingsa round me that are easier to do
It depends on the pursion
person*
6back
Damn
6whoa lagg
I hate it when that happens
2Obese whales?
Whales cannot be overweight
2Well, yes, I know that but why?
/me 2slaps Aduro
they're the largest mammal on the planet.
Fresh_blood: I was wondering why it said that you only end up with one alkene, is it because the heat causes it to rise, that the densest fraction doesn't receive enough hydrogen?
/me 2slaps Aduro around a bit with an even larger haddock
But are there not enough H atoms, because the heat causes it to rise?
/me 2has been struck by a ... pole dancing pole
Oh.
/me throws a pie at Deathbat's face
/me 2hurls some maths at Aduro.
2My sister said division is worse than pie :/
2HIM
Let me edit that
2HIM>?????????QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ!!!!!!!!!
I created it for someone else
/alias fail :P
12Moob?
Moob= Man boob
10mmm quiche
Mmm, pepsi.
mmmmm Porn
/me 2removes all the porn from Aduro's laaaarge inventory
10nothing beats quiche, end of
2Which kind of quiche?
2I used to think it was spelt kiesh
2:D
10lorraine, but no onions
2nomnomnom
/me takes his porn back
10aww...my quiche is all gone now :(
/me burns all of Aduro's porn, whipes his hard drive, and all external memory sources.
7Can't you just kill him and be done with it?
10Where's the fun in that?
10Bah, homemade porn
its the best kind
2Mmm, homemade porn XD
:)
10Should you children even be talking about porn?
HA!
I'm seventeen
10Ha, still under the 18 minimum
10And still a child
But, mine isn't normal porn, it doesn't involve humans
2...
2Kjakings, HOW much zoophilia are you wanting?
10lol
and Yiffy stories
Furry art/stories
Pornography is any material (either pictures or words) that is sexually explicit.
Doesn't have to contain humans.
It's still porn.
10Could contain tetris blocks
^
But, still
10Depends if its tasteful
10Again, tasteful
10Because it's tasteful
One of my friends is just getting into the grove of that.
groove*
"the display of a female ankle in Victorian times was regarded as most risqu"
10Pretty much
>.>
I may see if my friend would draw a nude picture of me
10And?

<.<
2My ankles are weird XD
12I'm scared.

10Funny that, I've just got a mental picture of a magikarp actually moving the word conversation
12Mmmm.
2:O is sorry
/me 2sends Magikal some chocolate as chocolate is the answer, as well as 42!
10I'm probably going to die tomorrow

2Toothpaste!
4BYE
2I used to eat Milk Teeth when I was about 4
2Bye Magikal
See how many tubes of toothepaste you can eat before you die, lol.
10im sure I could get through at least a dozen
10maybe even a baker's dozen
Hm.
10then again, that would mean I would have eaten at least a litre of toothpaste
4Toothpaste tastes good
Wow that's a lot, lol.
2Never tried it
10tried it once, never again
2HA my sister's in my brother's high chair
2She's 12
10Cool, wish I had a high chair...
12Yay!
12Ok.
10You can sit above everyone then :P
That's like saying you want a lorry, because you can drive while sitting above everything else. :P
10Aw, cool, get me one, or a monster truck. I enjoy looking down at other road users
Lol.
10the majority did
10the rest either ignored me or simply stuck their finger's up
Lol.
2Ahh when we were going ice skating once on a school trip we waved at about 7 lorries and one kind spanish man waved back :D
10lol its always fun waving at strangers
10of course I simply looked at a boy on a tricycle once and he put his finger up. Gobsmacked me, he was only about 4
2WTF!
2hahaaa
Wow.
Nice to see how next generation's youth is turning out.
10yup
10he's probably all drugged up now, it was about two years ago

6gtg
6Bye
10D:
Hm.
You still there, Fresh_blood? :P
10Of course lol
Care to explain how plastic, and hydrocarbons are related?
10Plastics are made out of hydrocarbons
And is it naphtha that is used for making plastic, or are other fractions used for making it too?
10Depends on the hydrocarbon's composition. For example, whether they contain Chlorine or not
"Plastics are typically polymers of high molecular weight, and may contain other substances to improve performance and/or reduce costs."
10Yes, that's right. They have a high molecular weight because they can possibly contain hundreds of carbon and hydrogen atoms
Hm.
10Lubricants
Ok, thanks.
I mean when they make polymers.
10Oh, yes, but they control it and make polymers with certain structures
Hm.
/me 13looks around
10I know something that might help you
10http://www.4college.co.uk/as/index.php here
Do they use naphtha as a base for plastic, or another fraction.
10go on it, click AS level
Ok, I'll read it.
LOL, AS level?
Ok, thanks.
LOL, ok.

when it's COLD
14O:
you have to find a way to keep warm
and it's harder to go outside and do things as a consequence
12I'd rather be hot personally, I find the cold unbearable.
12I actually dreaded ever doing anything over the last winter because it was nearly always minus numbers -v-

people always say that
It doesn't.
6I prefer the cold
06me too
you can prefer it possibly
12prince-dari, no matter how many layers I had I was still dying of cold, I used to wear two pairs of warm trousers and about 10 things on top which restricted my movement, was horribly uncomfortable and worst of all, every time I walked into a shop I would overheat and have to start taking them all off
but of course it bothers you
Oo
12I HATED last Winter, I wanted to cry at times
12Stop taking BF seriously

Ok, from now on, I'll call it South.
6Those things..I think they're called Erklings..

hei
10hi
wb
thanks
although I can see someone saying something like "pit = home"
hi all
which I can assure you is not the case
10good :o:
ANTH
we do have a pit though
we throw people into it when they don't pay their money on time
10dramatically i presume.
Normally, do you do any AS level work during Year 9 at school?
probably not
Oo
depends on the course
the first part of AS level is just a repeat of GCSE
bahaha
that's quite easy
AS = GCSE chemistry?
not mine
I mean
AS = A level, I think.
we compare A-Level chemistry to GCSE chemistry
i.e. atomic levels
but it's not the same
6im here
10http://r-xotib-create.deviantart.com/art/Saix-Chibi-colored-128053822 <--- got on dA and saw it on the first page
10it's cute
7Rora, finsihed the Doduo line.
tbh I doubt yr9 work is AS level chemistry
possibly
idunno
7http://leversa.deviantart.com/art/Saix-Chibi-44549921 <-- I still prefer that. :P
oh
hmm
Polymers, plastics.
well
which is easy
well, organic chemistry at AS is uuh
well
6quan, pm?
6show me
:P
dunno about polymers and plastics either
Lol.
we did things like reaction mechanisms
oww my skin it burns '-'
Oh well, having learnt most of the GCSE course now, next year shouldn't be too hard, right?
which involve lots of curly arrows
sun burn nick?
yup
chemistry is a piece of wee-wee at GCSE
it's like
the hardest thing is
or something ridiculous
Lol.
6lol
tl;dr
I've already got one GCSE in the bag, really.
do *not* take chemistry at AS
if
you're only taking it becuase you got good results at GCSE
well, you could take it for that reason
apparently physics took the place
Well, it's a long time before I have to make that decision.
*the
Biology and physics do not miz well -_-
lolyes
biology is a hobby
:(
/me runs
chemistry is useful
Biology is like more in-depth Geography.
7Grevious16 is still here?
and anasthetics
We wouldn't have any plastic without chemistry. :P
we wouldn't have most things without chemistry
!!!
we wouldn't have medical knoledge without biology...it is biolkogy
really
*Biology
yah rly
i wouldnt have my sanity if i had have taken it :(
?
We wouldn't have biology without chemistry
we wouldn't have chemistry without physics
^5 Horo
we wouldn't have physics without mathematics
Biology and chemestry cannot exist without each other BF, case closed
End of.
but chemical physics
is like
and hi guest
awesome
chemistry can exist without biology
bio sucks imo
it was boring
Physics is awesome
Physics is likes maths, it all makes sense, there is only one logical answer. :P
not rly dari
Yeah, really.
my physics teacher was like 25.
>.>
well, yes... but its more complex than most maths
Considering that all physics is based on maths, not really.
one of our teachers had a phd but sucked at teaching
mmm
i think you can do that
lolno
using
/me stops argueing cause he knows he usually looses
and maths is far more complex than physics (at least classical physics that is)
something like
a metric tensow
*sor
but I forget the name of the theory
Quantum physics is another matter. Especially when you combine it with computers
/me hugs the imaginary kilobyte
fyi: ten dimensional metric tensor was discovered in 1850's
O_o
I think you probably mean proposed
mmm
ten dimensiona.....never mind, wouldn't understand -_-
check the Riemann tensor
and proposed, probably
board
becuase you can't verify it
or maybe you can
idk
hmm
thing i
well then
bbl, gonna have a shower
ten dimensional theory is part of superstring theory
Nick Silverwing|shower
damnit D:
fail2u
XD
but there's more than ten dimensions
>:
hmm
/me prods the 11th dimension
theoretically
but I think it all boils down to ten or something
magic
beats me
Definition of a dimension is?
i don't know
can anyone define a dimension?
Time is a dimension
length is a dimenion
*dimension
no
there are for dimensions we can empirically verify
ooh
I remember that
In the real universe, there are only real numbers. Which are numbers ranging between zero and infinity minus one
whole numbers only
vacuum energy is close to 0
ergo, there cannot be an infinity
but apparently not 0
virtual particles are fun
hmhm
/me hoardes gravitons
hey
02Hi Hawkfish
Hawkfish!
hihi
hmm cool.
howzat?
i must have paid no attention in physics, i hardly know any of this
air, dunno
pretty fast.
3*10^8 m/s iirc
10or well, higher, then a bit lower, and today ^
*m/s^1
wat
How do you create a vacuum of energy 0?
also i go now
10bye alt
bye
I like the idea of the universe having a wave function
o//
cyas~
Evidence is iffy. Current instruments arn't good enough to say conclusively either way.
Well, how is it worked out in theory?
maths
Maxwell calculated it.
10Yeah, but it's a theory that might be right, and certain things speak for it.
I have no idea how to understand his equasions. They look calculusy.
10But then again, no theory can be 100% sure... only damn close
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light <-- pic on right points out that the light's in a vacuum and only at 0.9997c
well really
I suppose there's lots of vacuum
It would crate a very slight reduction in pressure, that's all.
even within atoms
33.6 m/s
African
6LOL
There are only two types of energy.
6I actually know that quote
10o_O
Oo
10in use and "can be used" lol
10stored and beeing used
vacuum energy is a form of potential energy
All the other are sub-types of those.
right.
10Airwaves but sort of.
Two types of energy, four types of force.
Hm.
Does anyone know why vacuums happen?
becuase there's nothing there
But why does there have to be something there?
particles must be evenly distributed
causing a vacume
no, vacuums occur because particles aren't evenly distributed
It must always be balanced.
particles gather around points of high-gravity leaving less elsewhere
/me had Angels and Demons randomly pop into his head.
Light is both a particle and a wave
(Black hole)
And anyone can survive an anti-matter explosion in theory. just not being hit by the actual antimatter
PET scanner
Hm.
10No reflection.
mmm
cool (y)
But why does it take such a strong gravitational pull to create a noticeable affect on light, where as most other things are noticebly affected with much weaker pulls.
you sure that's not just the accretion disk you're thinking of?
becuase light is fast
because light is travelling at the speed of light
10and people appearently don't like infinity
10lol

I'm not sure of that myself, but I know it depends on the interactions between atoms.

7Since I pretty much can't drive, I'm stuck with no license
12LOL HORO, I never learned that way
7I do my traveling on bike
07CelestialPhoenix, public transport!
12I remember my friends and my sister just pushing the bike and me peddaling and crashing multiple times XD
hey, it's the way I learned, and my sister learned the same way at way younger than most people learn
07LOL I did that too Arti!!!
lol/
12^v^
/me did...not
Horo
7Not here unfortunately, there is no trains I can use like Arti for example
OKAY.
no such thing as flat where I live
07arf
becuase I'm HARD
/me sits all over Shara
^
12Gosh.. good bikes are expensive, never really knew just how expensive they were
Craigslist :/
7How much are they, good ones are $200 here
I sold 3 bikes for $70
Never know
12About 150-200
12But I was hoping I could get a good second hand one for 50-70
10Were they used bicycles, Shara?
yeah.
No
Two were.
One wasnt
And use that to buy seagull feed
7OMG, Small*
12LOL!!!!!
England Smells?
/me had thoughts it did...
12It does, in places like Birmingham :>

7Like I said to you earlier, those without a driver's license are looked down upon
12Yeh America's weird like that
12I mean how many of the older members here have cars? XD
12From England
Its easy
/me 7wants to live in England now. D:
12It'd be a step up from Detroit >v>
hi arti
....how do you know about that?
7I don't live in Detriot, just near it
7'Cause Detroit sucks
12Yeh same as DRF
I'm sorry about the Lions.
12But it's still Detroit to me LO
12*:O
7Eh?
07lol
o.o;
oh
And Kwame?
7I was laid off few times, the economy is critical here
Meh, sucks here to.
You guys got it worse, though.
People keep moving down here >_>;
10ohgod
12I cannot get over how beautiful this is http://shadow-wolf.deviantart.com/art/Fern-Fox-48669720
7That's pretty in detail
very nice
7Arti didn't I tell you a fox was found by my family a couple months ago?
12Ovo no
awww
12Eep
12brb
lunged?
7Yes, it growled too
o.o
7It didn't reach me due to it's injury
7I really wish I could help it
7Then it boldly moved into the nearby sewer under the road
7Animal Control hopefully came and took care of it
Aww
12back
12I'm really surprised to hear that!
12What first got you into birds>?
7Ah, well, I have always been into birds
7Seeing Robins or Thrushes on the front lawn in my youth would get me excited and rushing outside just to pounce and try to catch it
7But how I became mesmerized by them was a very disturbing story
12LOL oh come on
i got in to birds in falconry
12I want to know now!
/me does too kinda
You got me with disturbing
12Same XD
Oh no.
12Uh oh
Cardinal?
7A cardinal of all birds got in my line of sight, but don't worry, I didn't hit it
7Yes
Phew :p
7I took up the interest in birding at age 20
7But since then, I admired birds
12How old were you?
12Back then
7I was probably 13-14
07Bleh I regret getting into birds, myself.
07O.o
7You shouldn't! Birds are amazing creatures
07CelestialPhoenix it's the circumstances.
12I was about to say that!
12Hawkie is a sentence theif!!
/me never really "Got into them"
07LOL!
12Want to know how I got into birds?
7We're all different people
/me was brought here by his ex-mate, just stayed
12Oh :O I'll ask you about that in a bit Shara.
07I'm curious
XD kay :p
07who was that?
shara's male?
yes.
12Er yeh? XD
7firefox.
7><
12CP, I was 9 years old
07I EAT ARTI'S SENTENCES
07they're chewy
12XD
oh well I'm probably wrong about the gender of other people aswell
7Quite a nice way to get hooked
7I bet he did that on purpose just to see if you were interested in birds
7Like I said earlier, I was always interested in birds
12Maybe, I'm not sure
12But he keeps joking about it to this day saying "What have I done?!?!" whenever I outsmart him on the subject :>
7It's like heaven to me
only need £1000 to own a hawk
07And then you need to care for it
07Lol
07Anyway
12yeh lol
07from before that I'd had an interest in eagles
7Grandfather brought me his binoculars and said, "Let's watch birds", I smiled. :)
07:>
12...Mmmm...
7You suffered emotional trauma?
07CelestialPhoenix, pretty much.
7Losing interest in my favorite activities perhaps permanently, didn't want to talk to anyone
7I had to start from the ground up, after taking a counselor's advice
07CelestialPhoenix, I became obsessive. I would talk/think about nothing else, and drove my friends away. I'd been the most popular girl around the street and had lots of people around me, and I ... drove them away, my self esteem dawdled when they would no longer give me validation and went to others
12For different reasons I'm sure..
07I was bullied throughout 4th-10th, and finally... One year ago.. I've gotten back into things
07CelestialPhoenix in addition to that I also had to cope with family issues
07So I became very mistrustful
12Which reminds me..
7At least you were popular...
12(because I just invisined it again)
07Hm?
7I didn't have many friends back in school
12I still want to make that picture of you and me, how I'll ever do it or find the time I don't know..
07Oh which one was that again?
07you mentioned it but I keep forgetting.
7That's...a great idea Arti
07that's okay.
07http://blackfeatherstudios.com/irreplaceable.html
07wow
12Maybe I'll paint it.
07o.O
07from my former friend
07emily
07Dwaggin, if anyone remembers her.
12V______V
12Yes
12My heart kinda sunk when I saw that
Sheenah.
o_O;
07Articuno it was my own fault.
07I drove her away too, but it's an experience I've learned from
/me brushes the ashes off
12But you're still irreplacable to her and everyone else.
/me huggles
12Heh
/me huggles
12I feel that way to one person and one person only
12Surprisingly Fox. When we were friends.. we were the best of friends.
12:>
7Ah, you two are surely good friends
07Were.
7yes, were
02hawkito ^_^
07Because a lot has happened, I sorta have to accept and move on, otherwise I'll drown in my own tears o.o
/me pounce
/me 7sighs
07Well at least you learned from it.
07Ah...
7But I did find her brother
/me pounces back
12Thats good enough isnt it?
/me had a good friend for 10+ years until something stupid happened.
12Contact him?
12D:
7Not exactly, he won't answer the PM I send him he read it and ignored it
07heh on the subject of friends...
07Articuno may I PM you?
7Sigh I hope I get over my depression soon
7These suicide thoughts won't go away, I need more confidence perhaps
12Don't be like that >v>
12EW LOL
7Ow
/me RUNS!!
o.o;
No...
/me 7eats Shara
I meant understand o.o
/me 7spits out
/me is food.
o.o;
7Why doesn't anyone have enough floof
7?*
:p
7I'm like this for several reasons Arti if you're interested
12Mhm
12Go on :>
02no fair
02only i can be immature
12:O
/me sits down
BIRDS CAN SIT?
OVO;
/me sits on Arti
/me does something immature
7I just wasn't myself
7The negativity just kept coming
7Do as you wish
7I had no one to speak to, share my feelings with
7Finally expressing my dream of becoming a fantasy writer just made things worse
7Then the negativity struck again, which lead me to stop writing(or at least try to)until I had some positive, understandable critique but I figured it was just selfish of me
/me 7sighs
7If I'm gonna get my license, I need more confidence
02Hawkie needs to change her name to Bow
07Lol what+!
02so when people address the relationship they are like "Bow and Arrow"
12But why?
12Why are you losing interest I mean?

12OVo???
12Why?
07As long as I'm in school I have to concentrate 100% on that
07Working would distract me from my schoolwork which she won't have any of
12True yeh..
07Yeah
07But I kinda want to work on the sidelines too because I could use the extras.
07We'll see,. I can't go against her until January anyway
07ARTI
07i just realized
07this year
12Yeh
12Oops wrong window
07been here for four years
07whee
/me petpets Arti "good luck finding one"
07I still remember I was afraid of you LOL
07and even more frightened of falco XD
07he was menacing
07And always playing dystopia with helios?
07o.O
Oh, I remember him slightly
07CelestialPhoenix LOL I remember my first impression of you
07I thought Arti coveted you, didnt want anyone else talking to you and such XD
07until I got to know you
07Lol!
12What?!
12LOL
12Why?
07and never really talked much to anyone else
12XDDDDDD
07and Arrow LOL!
07I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE OTHER ARROW kvfkafdklaa
07sorry XD
Well, you're not the last one to think that
12Arrow Quivershaft?
07yeah
12lol
and I do tend to keep my relationships to a minimal
Quivershaft sounds....oddly dirty. @_@
07LOL it does
... lol
because I'm too lazy to type it again
Me? When I get back
07Arrow he's not my type at all lol.. he's good to discuss redtails with though
I don't know when
07Sure
07I'll join arrow :>
okay
tell me when you do though
Go ahead without me, I'll probably stay here for a while
/me huggles the peregrine falcon and squishes him ^v^
This comp can't run much
And THOU CANST SQUISH A ROLLYBURDY.
07for example TRY and work on BFS
07noo
07THTATS CHEATING jfjagsnja
07Quilava I know
/me squishes a rollyburdy anyway
@Quilava You should poke Elysium and co.
/me eats Hawkie's floof because he can
but I barely know any of them D:
/me also pounces arrow
07nooo not my floof
07FOOFY
DYNAMITE PLANTED!!
/me planted dynamite at Hawkie's Floofpile
07DYNAMITE DEFUSED!!
We require more vespene gas
/me defuses it
12LUGIA EATING
Geez
/me plants moar dynamite.
DYNAMITE PLANTED! DYNAMITE PLANTED!
/me defuses it all
Argh
/me eats the dynamite
07arrow run out of engineering power already
07oo
/me gives arrow some mineralsa
07-a
07o.o!
/me watches for spawn points
07oh feesh
/me camps arrow's spawn point
/me because he is evil like that
Good luck, spawn points in Wolfenstein are pretty hard to camp
/me gives Arrow a recon plane.
On the contrary
That I know of at least in online FPSs
Damn. :(
/me gives Arrow a watermelon.
The best way to spawn camp is with Field Ops
12and even worse in Goldeneye.. I remember the spawnning points and the order they go in..
And even then it's prety hard.
07lol
07meeps
You get a 5 second invulnerability when you spawn in
Or was it 3 secs/
I forget
07Hm
12Yeh it's pretty bad XD Don't tell Pidge but I've cheated loads of times to beat him that way, just by killing him then quickly running to his next spawn point over and over XD
07If it's at all possible
07o3o
I think it is
12Is it TST related?
There are mines in Wolfenstein =D
12That's Xai's weapon of choice too >v>
They're actually really fun to operate
07i bought it and let arrow borrow the disc
07:p
I used to know the Facility stage by heart, planted mines at spawn points
12It's the ONLY way he can beat me..
10[18:43:40] <~Articuno> Is it TST related? <--- @me?
07without the disc, nowa lot of the cutscenes turn upside down
07lol
07I tried today arrow
07it
07floofed
07o4
07*o3o
12LOL
10Nope lol but I can add TSTers in there
12Nah dont! I was just curious, just make it how you were going to make it
07I seriously want invulnerability to that thing XD
10XD
Or you could just stop flooding
07that too
07>.>
07<.<
Then she can't complain =P
Of course
07and meh XD
07arrow
12http://culpeo-fox.deviantart.com/art/Kit-Fox-Tragedy-127604453
07why did they take that away anyway?
07Like OVER AND OVER AGAIN and now
07it's all boring
Well
071 sec
The mod No Quarter changed it
And apparently someone is into hard vore
07LOL that amuses me a lot
07Oh Arrow that failed
07I was floofing around on furnet and apparently someone has a thing for birds
12OMG
07so I left the network
07Yep -.-
/me can bomb them.
07Elion or something like that
07I dont remembe
12I mean would they REALLY do that IRL to random people?
07r the name precisely
/me coughs.
07im sorry
You're making generalizations.
07Not really
07heh
Yes really.
07Nope^^
07Or had to hide from them
That's... not really inconsiderate either. It's part of the culture at FurNet.
07because they'd be creepy like that
07e
07h
07Im not talking about furnet only
They are inconsdierate
07Very
07I was not thrilled
12Who-re
12LOL
Lol.
07LOL
Look
12Erm no, why do yuo think I am calling you one?
Because I go onto FurNet. <.,
*<.<
12Ok thats nice, did I say everyone on furnet was a who-re?
Because I hate generalizations.
07so do I and arrow, but that's besides the point
12Yeh but you just generalised them yourself
7Stereotypes, peh.
It IS a generalization. There's bound to be a few good guys out there
12You said that's how the "culture" is
12and if that's how it is, why does it bother you?
12Ovo
07I've met a few nice furries btu i've had to look long and hard for them.
But the fact of the matter is, from our observations, that there are more bad guys than good guys there.
It's the same with the community on Battlestations.
I wouldn't say bad
07Cute_Riolu, and I don't? I've been there for a long time as well, though only recently under a name people here would know.
Just messed-up in the head
12Ok, but you still generalised them yourself
12and you agreed that they do act like that because it's their "culture"
12Bah, Cute just never ever wants to hear people say they don't like something that he likes
07when someone PMs me
07and I think it's annoying and inconsiderate
12Where did I say you cant, paste it
12:>
@CR I think that was a little outta line
>.>
07Eh
When did I say /you/ can't.
12Where did I say "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LIKE FURRIES AND THEIR INCONSIDERATION"
07I agree with Arrow..
07that was just uncalled for
12I didn't say you said I can't XD
07LOL
Maybe I should abandon ship.
<~Articuno> Bah, Cute just never ever wants to hear people say they don't like something that he likes
07eh no worries arrow
07we should all drop this really
07o3o
No, I don't.
07CelestialPhoenix yeah but why me z.z
I don't like it when I know I have friends that are like that are GOOD PEOPLE.
I have a feeling everyone has some kind of fetish somewhere
12Well why did you act the way you did when I said it was inconsiderate?
Ever hear the saying, "there are no girls on the internet"?
07I think thats where I get fed up with furries for
07I get that a lot from the members there
12XD
07LOL yeh!
LOL
07XD
07LOL...
Because for example, mainly guys play girl characters on WoW
12Typos due to RSI
I don't disagree with that. :P
07when we got wow, we had fun making a girl
07and then undressing her as much as we could
07o3o
07we fail though
I have a pair of female characters on Mabi
But by that same note, most people on there EXPECT that.
My main is a male though
j/k
12I know, and people should never expect things of other people
07Agreed with Arti.
07I mean ok
07One thing
I used to be a wow-player for 4 years
12It's very inconsiderate, it means people aren't thinking about other people, only themselves really
I got sick of it, nothing else to do
07person goes on furnet looking for pixelly smexins, another thing is
07when i go on
07and dont encourage ANYONE.
Since each server is operated by a different person.
07yeh but i dont think furnet has a rule on it that everyone should want sexual approaches when signing on ;)
Maybe
12It's not a rule to pounce all over someone and try to get into their trousers though
12lol
But then again
It could be an unwritten rule
07Eh unwritten rules are called norms
It's an assumption that other people make
I agree Arti
07you can break those and be considered odd, but it still doesn't mean they have the right..
07because I don't encourage it.
I'm not saying they're right or wrong
People don't think about their actions much
07If I had, then I'd lose complaining rights.
07even when you only enter a channel and say hi?
07egh.
07fail.
12Yeh but expectations aren't very nice.
Maybe
07remember Namu?
07or kaycia
07she wouldnt leave me alone o.O
07LOL!
12Hi Mib
"Some"?
07Yeah
12XD
07Arti
07if you had done that to me when i joined
02would anyone here call me an idiot
12LOL!
07HI YOU STINK OF SWORDFEESH
07i'd be
07creeped otu
02if i say i'm watching the twilight zone?
07and flown away
07o3o
12LLOOOL
02fine
DAMNIT >:(
02i'm the only one D:
07ah well
Depends on the show
07Note to self
Sure, it may be questionable if you were watching teletubbies or somethng
Yeah
But you're just watching a tv show
07Im only gonna stick around channels where i has friends
07z.z
07failfurs
My external harddrive is out of memory D:
07LOL
Teletubbies were after my time.
12LOOOOOOOOOL I used to be obsessed with them
12when I was 10
Teletubbies were fail
/me runs
And I like watching furries
10?
07XD
And observing them
12YES 10 XD
Not about to join them
They weren't around that long if I recall?
12It was a school fad
The SFAF isn't furry enough. XP
Huh..
12Yeh they came out when I was about 10-11
07*well
anyway I'm gonna try and get me some sleep
07Ok
12Anyway it was aimed at 3 year olds but for some reason everyone loved them
07sleep wel
12Night LLOTS
07LOL
07heh
02night llots
07I used to watch them
07it meant
07I could rant and complain
07ALL I WANTED
12RN is a furry but I luffs her
I just observe them and keep a healthy amount of skepticism when encountering them.
I understand that, it's still pretty questionable though
07and blame the teletubbies
12Arrow, ever watched them IRL?
/me connects bluetooth remote and watches some movies instead
Night all
You've been to furmeets before, right?
12I have, that's the reason I'm not associating myself with them anymore
12yeh
07How are the furmeets anyway?
12Well the ones I went to were just a group of idiots getting drunk etc.
12Oh and NON STOP YIFFING in public.
07egh
Heh
10I'm such a noob
07x.x
07feather
10I just figured something out on Photoshop
Yiffing in public? With their fursuits no less?
07ugh
we're all noobs to something
10XD
12No not always with suits.
And are there even enough women to do that with?
I was under the impression that most furries are male
12Yes a lot of the girls were horrible who-res
12Yeh?
My cuz would like to sign up, but we only have my comp, can she sign up on this?
12It's held in a pub or something of the like, boring..
12Yes she can
And there are some parties in which there isn't any dancing
My college hosts LAN parties every month =D
12My favourite :>
That means I have to log out for a sec, brb then
07Bleh LOL
/me sighs
I want to play some online Brawl
But I completely suck right now no thanks to depression
07but the guys
07was all
12Ovo
07even though i was all 'pfft' x.x
07at them
That's awfully sexist
07they were that kind of people
07yeah
I cannot remember, it was last year I think
07but they weren't really grown up either :p it just means I couldnt go!
My battle group could technically be furries but I think they're too militant and not sexual enough
I should try to get someone to draw squadron crests for my characters
07MIIBURD
07poke miiburd
07she could do it
12Blah, furries are only furries if people call them that
Yeah, it is a stereotype
07yeh
07Hm
07I dont think i can quite label myself..
07I don't seem to fit in any really
07Lol
12I label myself.... A TSTER XD
Orzel? Since when was he into the silvers?
07You didnt get that?!
07...
Such a stereotype exists?
07you fleeb, he was clearly interested.. lol.. he even wanted their story in written form!
Internetties? Heh
Ha ha, alright then
07In addition to myself but ra
116th Tactical Fighter Squadron
12But thats just it, it's the same as one stereotype, you all usually just have a few things in common and nothing else after that
07Ah i never saw the formal name
07i has no squadron, no anything, I'm just.. foofy
07foooofy
07Ok
07Sleep well
'night
Bye Arti
07take care arti ;>
12Night night
Arti I wanted to ask you a favor
02you leavin Arti? Gdnight
It's not sadly, it involved the Wii
12LOL
I wanted to see if I could send you something
G'night
07Arrow mrr, wait
07Ok now I'm probably gonna be whacked but..
??
07I really don't know O.o and CelestialPhoenix
Squadron = air force
07Ah :>
07Ok
07makes sense
Oh crap, Sneas is on
07You dont like sneas?
07Ah...
07I'm curious o.O
I like him, I'm just taken back that he considered me his best friend when we barely spoken to each other
He just likes me a lot
07CelestialPhoenix I dislike Sneas really
That's how the silvers have it, the real air force has it differently
hi
07Sorry but he was awful toward one of my best friends ever and such, caused her distress enough to make me want to flay him :>
07But
07I just dont speak to him anymore
07Ah...
07Seems quite complicated actually
07Or more, component-y
7Fwew, done with the Fearow. :D
07yeh
07How .
That, and since I'm the quiet type, it's sort of my fault
07many silvers are there anyway?
Maybe in the ten thousands
07Heh CelestialPhoenix, I found him to be WAY too 'hi I think you're great!' for my taste
Pretty strong
But nowhere near as strong as their adversaries
07Hm
07gets me wondering how many ships they have
07really
The Anadian military branches have 5 million
At least
07BLEH XD
07More than Norway
07's population
07again
07argh
07lol
Anadia is frickin' huge, remember
It takes up over half the world
07I dont actually
07did you ever draw a world map?
07Or is it that one named arrow is lazy or something
07in my old files
Endale takes up about 40%
Anadia, maybe 55%
02I forgot my password yet again :o
07Hm
07I forget how to pronounce Cyroia actually
07Cyprus
07oO
07or something
07that's the association i get anyway
07Ah ok!
Maybe around 500 at most
That's more than the USN
07Ahh
Anadia and co. have a few more
But they're much stronger and sturdier than SFAN ships
07hey arrow
07I always wondered
Yah?
If you stay in there for too long
But it's impossible to fly in there by accident
07Oh?
It's impossible to get close to it without knowing
07Ah
07Has it ever happened though?
No
07Ah
07Ok
07O.o;
07that timefrost thing
07is scary.
Ahh
/me flops on Arrow
Yeah
It was pretty brutal
07Why..?
07Just because they helped the silvers?
7WHEW.
Yeah
7Done with the emoticon meme. X3
07in his universe of floof
hi Quil
Yeah
The Anadians really hate the silves
7 O_o
Even if it's an entire country
07Heh
07so everyone got blasted?
07even the civilians?
07Oo
Yup
07Bleh
07flail
07No survivors?
There could be a few
still D:
But the chances of surviving the frigid waters of the North Rygelian Sea are
slim
At least
07Mm
07Quilava no one is home z.z
Suffice to say, neither the Anadians nor the Endalians bothered to search for survivors
07so I has no company
07heh
07I feel sorry for them
07how did they find out anyway?
we're company D:
The Skywind
The Cyroians hid it, sure, but scanning equipment is a little more advanced =P
07Arrow is spiffier than a raven :>
o.O

http://www.planetwolfenstein.com/files/files.shtml

07c ube darn you
07ffs
They apparently were going to release it as a commercial expansion pack to Return to Castle Wolfenstein
07or?
But they had problems with the single player aspect
The multiplayer portion was released on its own
07ahhh
Yeah, it's totally free
It's now totally open source
07Nice :>
They also made Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which is commercial
07One thing I didnt know
But I like Wolfenstein more, because it's free
And it's already moddable
07you tried the commercial oen?
07*one
07ffs
07i cant type
Nah, I haven't tried the commercial one
07Ok

6Arti, yup
6looks amazing
12Ho-oh's one is prettier though
6it's prettier, but lugia's is more drmaatic
12No not that
LOL, the weird pokeball thing that comes with HG/SS is a rather strange idea.
6ah

Uh, me? Or someone else?
12Huh?

Hi Arti
I must be mistaken
What's wrong with them?
they're much too spike-like I think
Ahh
6hmm...
6I agree about the spike part
6but I think the fins can be kept upwards if it wants
6part of the voluntary movement
hi Xeli
nah, would be way too uncomfortable - and not needed
12It drags
12But anyway
12It's just for show
6but if it were just going along with the flow, maybe :/
12It's an intro after all, and it's not the best graphics
I bricked rawra too hard...

Data recovery and repair is one of my many areas of knowledge :>
12I recovered these about.. last year I think
Oh, that isn't a screwed log. That's non-ascii data that got mixed in.
12There;s nothing of it Vyl, other than that.
But yeah
12Can you somehow recreate the log from just that?
there you go, thats how I got to know arrow o.o anyway
Not if you just paste it over IRC. You'd have to send me the file to examine.
That actually looks like the output from some kinde of encryption o.o
12Lol
12One sec'
And even then, only if it's a charset-detection issue.
12No it's just screwed logs

Hello BullMastiff~
/me 7randomly pokes Aero with a pickled daikon
/me flails and noms it. :D
6Feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.
oh - I've got a magpie on my balcony^^
those are one of the more intelligent birds ;)
6Magpies?
12I've been trying to attract those :/
/me 6is reminded of ASoM. D:
12They're ALL over the place here, they're right below as I speak
12But they never come up onto the balcony
/me 6asplodes in a flurry of tragedy.
12They're making a lot of noise at the moment
12Yes, corvids for the win
12Did you know Ravens can use logic?
I did
6ravens are gorgeous creatures
and intelligent
12What
12?
12The fact that they eliminated them?
eh?
may I quote:
12Ah yes
12These are pet birds
12They can still fly, not not long distances
with clipped wings..
12Clipped wings isn't nice
6it's depressing
6like declawing a cat
12But it doesn't hinder them that much
I'd like to clip the hands and feet of those clipping bird's wings!
6yup
14Floof
6I have a dentist appointment like.....right now o_O
there's plenty of that kind in old europe
12They do particularly well in cities though
I know. We've got some of them in our parks ;)
12Lucky
I know^^
I see ravens all the time here. Oo
12No you probably see crows
Cute_Riolu
It's hard to tell them apart from a distance.
12Ravens only live in the West
12Nah
I'm on IRC at home. :3
Ravens are bigger, and have a slightly different head shape.
12Look at the tail and size
And different tail, but you can only see that when it's spread.
Hm.
12No honestly you can see that when it;s closed up as well
12Infact it's easier
12Hold on
12I find images
I've only seen ravens at the tower...
I've seen wild rooks though!
A rookery, no less. I walked under it. If you ever do that, take an umbrella.
12LOL
whatever - they're all members of the same family ;)
06hiya SL didn't know you were here. ^<^
6Ohai.
oh, did you know "raven" is originally an old-german designation for a very wise man?
12and no
12Ravens can count :>
06I've saw Ravens when I was in Yellowstone. lol
06They were sitting on top of the sign and pecking at it that said not to feed the animals. XD
/me 6is randomly reminded from Chimera's entrance, LadyChimera.

07My father did though, but then again
12Yep
MS wants XP to die now. It's continued existance is an annoyance to them.
lol...
12Yeh I know!
12XP for free pls
12It has good games though
/me runs
I said MS *wants* XP to die. They can't seem to kill it though.
I've seen that pic already Arti. Looks...well...interesting oO
XP is preventing the sale of more Vista and Win7.
same
Has win 7 been launched yet...?
12Not officially
Noone is upgrading because XP is already perfectly good. businesses are downgrading.
just the Release Candidate is available
12But thats just it
6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
07I need to downgrade.
not really Arti
12Well here at least
12How long after Vista was launched?
still
12Well that's good but how long did it take them to make that agreement..?
12Lol, yes ok, but the vista sales still rose because of businesses.
But did the *use* of Vista?
12No
Highly fishing unlikely :D
12Thats why the stats are skewed :>
12Or you could just use an XP disc.
12Last year
I know that - because I've worked for such a stupid boss long enough
lol the leaked one?
12I reckon back then it'd have been leaked
ok
12But not sure
supposedly it's WAY less of a resource hog
12Our manager got rid of it and everything else shortly after
7 even runs on most Netbooks
12Wow impressive
and by "run", I don't mean run like Vista, but RUN
Yes, and I doubt they'll bother to fix most of them.
12Well they have.. 3 months..
12So we'll see
I'm actually alive to disapoint you :P
Look at how long it took them to do anything about the IE exploits.
the tills at work still have ms-dos >.<
12LOOOL
12Easier on their end
12Tills at CEX didn't :D
12We had XP lol
12Damn.
lol
heh
I've never seen a till with XP before. D8
12Well at least the more recent ones
Most things start out that way.
Like the Sims

/me points out she only has the wing, not all of Arti. Vanishes with Arti's wing.
she needs two wings, two!
7feeble minds predict great minds. :P
I've got a blonde joke
well a few
7I'm not sure which way round I was supposed to put that, to imply you were the feeble.
/me escapes easily by taking the wing to her home plane, which only members of her plane, or Travelers, can get to. :>
7feh. going to kill things
Pfft, I did exactly that!
no, you didn't
Because time isn't the same in this place compared to my home plane. >
:>
6LLOTS
/me pets lawts
12TimeShift controls ALL time, Drag :>
12and back
It's hard to explain, and would take me a good half hour, at least.
6timetalk makes my head hurt
the problem is: I'm part of the time itself
Ganderish?
6I amazingly understood TimeShift's explanation in his story, but lol
12Nooo
12Ever eaten Seagull?
But you aren't part of my plane's time.
6O_O
Nooo
oO
12Something like how that would taste I imagine
o.o
12XD
6LOL
My plane's time is seperate from every other dimension's time.
his name is jimmah
6o____o
6how can there be two different...yeah
This is one reason I dislike RP's, some people just can't lose ^^'
6time is the same
12TimeShift you have to play by their rules since they come up with some ridiculous thing XD
6o_o
6LOOOOOL
i hate this time talk!
IT HATCHED
6I personally think it's intruiging when I can follow alon
2628 steps :)
6g
/me stuffs a crab in Drag's mouth >_>;
12I can't remember any of it Ovo
6and ow......massive headache all of a sudden
Alright, one moment, this is going to take a bit to type out
"You don't have to pick? it up to move it. Just scare it away. That would be much more efficient than picking it up and scaring it to death." ...Clearly if it was going to move, the approach would have been enough to scare it off.
12LOL
meaning: You don't exist
12If it doesn't exist, then you don't exist, therefore my wing was never chewed
6then-
Pretty much, yes
6yeah
6nds vidhsvblidfxf
12LOL
6lateness
07Pointless argument ;)
6and there is no spoon
6SETTLED
I said technically, it doesn't exist, but then we start getting into a lot of different things about it's preoperties and such. Firasia, Aquanat, and all my charascter technically do not exist, yet do, because of this place's properties.

10o_O
why do you need to see all hidden files?
02i have reasons
How many blondes does it take to change a light blub?
2And ya don't wanna know about that!!
2LOL LIGHT BLUB!!
mm... should I go draw?
making hidden files shown is the same as in XP IIRC
6uhh 12?
02well i would of figured it out if it was the same as xp lol
/me is listening to: Nightwish - Elvenpath - 278
you should find the options there
none
6>.<'
but, to be honest, for the most part it's good Vista hides most of the files from the users. Around 96% of all problems regarding the computer result by a user doing some crap
02i need to darn break into a couple hidden files on my mp3 device
2?
It is in the same place as in XP
it's in folder options
02yeah
02but the way to get to folder options is different
02since vista doesn't have a menu on each window
it's in control panel.
the very first place I looked in both XP and Vista
aye. You just need to have the correct user rights :)
/me is listening to: - - -1

Okay look
6it doesn't happen that much >>;
totally
innit m8
Bloatedfish has had loads of complaints here before, but if you REALLY want me to I can bring it up with Arti -again- and re-evaluate his situation for the 472398th time
We've been through this before
it seems to happen an awful lot when i'm on :(
6not really
/me feels like it does
6we all just ignore him
Yeh
^
CLEARLY.
Cute_Riolu
stinks

I LOL Egh
6LOL kipi
but it hurts when people say things like that
6GAH
6CHEMISTRY
6it burnsssssssssssssssssssss
yeah?
heh
You have to learn eventually to filter things like these out, its very common on the nets
And we've talked through Bloatedfish's situation a lot..
6o_o
If you guys REALLY want me to we can talk with Arti again.
*formula
07because you can't read sarcasm
10and a formula to be trolled, BF
But I think it's unnecessary
no
10sadly
which is why you can ASSUME
or ASK
and we've been through this loads of times
(capitalised for emphasis, not shouting)
07or you could always just not do it
but why?
Cute_Riolu, I'd find other friends :>
then I would have NOTHING to say
Exactly.
because sarcasem FAILS (sometimes)
it doesn't matter, Cute_Riolu
BF is not good for the community. :P
you're not my friend anyway

12Please just listen
12You all attacked BF
hi2u
k
12*Name calling
6Kyu, PM?
07k
yes, i understand
12That's not acceptable behaviour even towards trolls :/ and BF was JOKING, how many times have we been through that..?
/me nods
12It's four of you in total that I can remember off the top of my head
kk
i'm sorry, i'll try to control my feelings
/me backs all of this up.
6I can't even read that far back with mibbit :/
i just....
Quil-drawing has me on ignore
If you do that
12Just the main prob here is how everyone acted
12Well that's at least one good thing to hear
That's all.
6huh, ignore is a universal code?
/ignore
/me 6learns even outside of school
derp
ok... sorry all
6lol but nah, it's ok
12But then if he doesn't know what's actually happening, if he only sees one half of whats going on around here, it's even worse to start attacking someone
12Aeroslash apology accepted
/me sighes
12What are you saying then?
We should still fight it though even though it might be recurring.
Expected and accepted are different
@Arti: Of course! Slapping overly-religious people is great </irony>
minimise the chances of a problem occurring
07lol TS
Arrow, thank you for putting things in clearer terms
12It's not about the arguments, it's the attacking etc.
/me is a trool then
-_-
Arguments, Attacking etc at the end of the day they are all the same thing
12They're not
i feel bad!
BF you aren't helping LOL
6I'm fine with arguments, but attacking is when things are unacceptable
YA!
6arguments are natural lifestyles
12I argue with Gullible all the time but I don't throw insults at him
yeah
6if it was me, then I apologize :/
12Rules can be bent. It's all common sense really
here - take those and throw with them!
it's fine
She could be worse, and boot you off if she disliked you but she doesnt!
She's rather kind like that.
no need to apologise to me, I'm not too bothered P:

YIP
It holds information relating to starting the program - console size, compatability settings, starting directory.

-.-
7CAKE?
Oo
2o.O
12Hey.
...
12You can'y prove anything.
I can.
Ahahahaha
12No.
2I can
12Never.
2I have no spine and no face
2And I'm still a zombieee ;D
Oh wait, I already have a sample.
12...
:)
2Email it to him xD
2Oh Dari, that was baaad D:
12You can't prove anything.
I can, but no one takes me seriously.
12I would.
2lag.
Oo
12Mmmhmm.
/me 7grabs a baretta and destroys Stacey's head. "No zombies."
Hello, Darrel.
2o.O
*decided
2Alrighty then
I defy you, heart man.
2Heart man?
Heart on stick must die.
But impaling is an acceptable consequence of this.
2My heart has been impaled as well.
2ON THE BLADES OF A COMBINE 'ARVESTER
/me 7decides this is not enough, and powers up the Rehabilitator
2You trying to break my heart too? Thanks
Not just break, lacerate.
2Had it done
2By the same damn person
7the Rehabilitator doth not break hearts.
2It might as well
7It breaks them down at the molecular level, translates them into electrical signals, sends them through the machine, then reassembles them on the other side.
7Wrongly.
Woldn't that be Womkavision.
7No.
*Wouldn't that be Wonkavision?
2It probably would
7aah, but it teleports things /wrongly/
7inside out, backwards.
7with three heads
2Is a moron :)
/me 2runs
:P
But really, I have to show you smething.
*something
No, really. Have you seen this? http://www.swtor.com/media/trailers/deceived-cinematic-trailer
You never showed me, lol.
7I did.
7I linked it here.
I just found it a few hours ago, because I was curious if they were making any more KOTORs.
Also, I doubt I said that.
7Someone did. I think it was you.
I definitely don't remember it.
7You don't remember a lot of things.
yays
I get to go to the mortar range this weekend
RDX: ...Oo
7Probably dari then.
7Irregardless, I linked it here whilst you were on.
...
Not me.
I don't care/haven't seen that link before.
And I didn't even open it now.
Yeah, you get the credit or whatever for that.
Got to go, though.
Seeya.
I would never say "Lol, clones wars." Because I don't see what's laughable about that, as I don't watch it.
7The laughable thing is animated Star Wars.

10CHIMERA
hi
12Why not Shiny-Ho-Oh?
04WUT
10I JUST BOUGHT A 18'' DIALGA PLUSH
10XD
10EEEEEEEEEE *is still shaking*
12OMFG YEH
04Lulz
12Im going to buy it right away while it's CHEAP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY arti look
10yeah
i found the poster 4 it
the ho-oh movie
hi kipi
/me sits on Kipi's feet
its out 2010
6this means a ho-oh plush too
7What time signature is Caramelldansen in?
'-'
6I swear, if they start making those darn pokedoll things again, there's no hope
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY
/me raises his wing "I do"
Whatchu sitting on my feet for?
07so you can't escape
I dun wanna escape
arti ur were right
Lol, Caramelldansen.
http://spyroflamesredsbum.deviantart.com/art/CARAMELLDANSEN-SPYRO-98274850
6LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
/me sighs
ho-oh and luga are going to fight in the movie
12You don't know that
12And I hope they dont
12That would be the stupidest thing they could possibly do
10If i know them right...
10epic cgi fighting, then Ash saves the day
07lol
The writers can always drag up a plot involving mind-control to justify a fight.
07that's a good formula
if you look at the poster it looks like there bout to fight
07if you remove Ash
07XD
07besides
2misty comes back and wins the day
12What poster?
07that's pretty much the formula for any movie
Nah.
yeah, Ash just uses picachu and zaps them both to the ground XD
2yup
10All of it, especially the remove ash thing.
2and hi RN
Well, except one person.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY this one arti
I don't like films where people kill the vampires.
^
12Thats not the 13th movie poster....
They bash into each other in the Johto openings
hey
maybe that's how they say hello
2Lugia
12THey don't, they only fly past each other
The person with the snag ball would win
But that would endanger the franchise.
02It's not the anime that made those two rivals, it's the fans :P
07lol
07that's sort of the plot of the first movie
12Exactly Shiny-Ho-Oh
12Thats why I think if they made them fight it would be REALLY stupid
And clichd
07you haven't seen the FIRST movie?
07XD
J
No.
yes?
12Roara, no one says it.
07well watch it lol

How do you bend spaces?
space*
its complicated
I don't truelly know myself
That makes no sense.
Vacuum itself isn't exactly nothing, either
I still don't see how that warrants being able to bend it.
*the oO
How?
No wait
Matter can bend space-time *
aww beaten
02random fact
02burritos are nice
it dips reletive to the body's mass
Yes
02what happens if murcury fell into the sun
it melts
7It wouldn't. :P
Not a lot.
I once heard that depending on how near you are to the Earth's surface, time may be faster or slower
that is correct
Can't remember which is relative to which
02eXAKR
02time pace is something we invented
*Planck
oo
How can time slow down? By that, do you mean that 1 second takes 2 seconds to happen as an example?
You leave one behind, take the other up and mountain, and bring it back. You'll find the clock that went up is very, very slightly shead of the one that stayed down.
I myself find that time seems to be slightly faster when I have woke up
people percieve time differently
lol
But yeah
/me pokes everyone with a stick
hard to say without being that person
Or, do different animals do that differently?
Yeah
/me poke'd
..?
/me dances
02in the twilight zone
-caps
TWILIGHT ZONE
If you get two people to count out 10 seconds, there shouldn't be that much difference, as 1 second is standardized.
Of course
7http://xkcd.com/391/
/me 7flees
Lol.
O_o
How can they perceive time at different rates?
its really complicated
Why would someone see a second as passing faster than someone else?
It could be possible, but near-impossible to prove
okay.. if you flew past someone really fast, as you passed they seem to go slower than normal
hai guest
Time Dilation
/me pokes someone
07Hm
07Im observing
the rate you percieve it as recording
07Oh hai J-man
rbr laundry dryng time
07Havent seen you in a while.
04Where's arti?
out
07Away it seems
aparently
07She's got guests over
07:>
04I still never got an apology from her.
it depends on their concept of time, it might be ma mere fraction of a second's difference
07J-man unfortunately for you she's not here right now though. She's got guests over which are staying overnight.
07Anyway
07prince-dari that's correct
I just can't see how it matters either way, as it's the same ammount of time, whether you think it has gone slowly, or quickly.
07Welcome back Dragryphon
hi
2hi Dragryphon
<prince-dari> I just can't see how it matters either way, as it's the same ammount of time, whether you think it has gone slowly, or quickly. <-- on earth yes, but in orbit you go at a slightly different time scale to earth (by mere miliseconds)
hi
07Welcome back-
04Internet died on me...
.....truth is Ive not really got a 100% clear idea of how it works
2Hi J-man
04yo...
07Ah
07Did you get my message?
Hello,
07Hey o.o
07Who be you?
Stryker
07Ok
04what message?
07[16:41:20] J-man unfortunately for you she's not here right now though. She's got guests over which are staying overnight.
07said this in the public chan, but you pinged shortly after.
back
07Front
07O.o
02o.o?
07I cant wait to talk to Arrow XD
07I want to tell him about this really disturbing dream I had
02........
its involving a trade
i wanna trade...
Giratini
for...
particles, ok.
a level 2 magicarp
The particles are displaced.
But that doesn't bend anything?
There are always particles.
They bend things slightly
07Crap
07Lol
wb
Individually
Why would it bend things?
/me needs to watch her language at times
02hi
And even in a complete, total vacuum... you still have virtual particles popping into existance and back out.
"bends" possibly being a metaphor
When I first read all of this, I was like,
"... this is madness!"
yeah
But then the facts screamed "THIS. IS. PHYSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICS!
back at me.
/me hides
07lol
Lol.
But yeah, it's boggles the mind
lol
I've seen the equasion for modeling even the simple bend around a point mass. G m1 m2 r^-2 it is not.
XD
07Arceus_pwnage don't worry
07I dont get it either, but they like to discuss things
I can't remember it. It took up several lines, and had a lot of calculus symbols in.
07eXAKR always has some random topic LOL
Lets talk about doing backflips on a tricycle
Don't worry. I expect very few people to understand all of these
lol
07Welcome back
omg i hate my computer
OK, imagine this.
/me implodes with all the sciency talk that he doesn't understand...
a glass prisim bends light
a easy example
It refracts it.
To me bend, means curves.
/me calls upon Dialga and Palkia to pwn all space-time talk
Light does travel in straight lines. But straight lines might bend.
refracting is bending
07J-man
07PM
As in, it stops it being in a straight line.
Yes
*cough*
It may take on a slightly curved shape
Or things like that
/me yawns
*cries* they stole dawns pokedex *cries*
It's like how some kind of glass can refract the light coming in from outside, making them appear distorted
Two lines can both be straight, and yet intersect at two points.
Hmmm?
/me hides
Because they are on a sphere.
If we draw a large-enough triangle on Earth, that can happen.
2J-man be hacking D:
lol
Just with one master ball? :P
oo
07Eh
It may bend impossibly, look smaller, or larger
/me is reminded of how the upper deck front windscreen on one of the double-deck bus models in his country distorts images when you look out through it.
Because the windscreen is very curved
Hm.
its impossible to tell

hey if Arti shows up again today, poke me in PM okay?
13I don't get it o.o
If it isn't that, I don't know anyfink about it.
13I got that xD
07Quilava ok
07Shw has people over
07I need to talk to her aswell..
07DRF and I agreed on bringing something up
07More information on that won't be discussed though :) before I get to talk to her
that's teasing
07Yep ;D
/me sneezes in Hawkie's face
oh
Lol?
10D:
/me steeples fingers and cackles
Not all of it.
10in other words
13I still don't get it :D
like the centripetal force one
10true
And a lot of it is mathematics, which I'm sure is a billion times more obscure.
http://xkcd.com/435/ <--- I like this one
13Somehow I just reminded myself of a slightly inappropriate joke I read in a book once
LOL
10lol
lol
and a lot of physicists did lots of maths
like Newton invented calculus
10true really.
10http://xkcd.com/55/
10lol
I would say that mathematicians are like the direct opposite to philosophers
and physics is somewhere in the middle
hmm
d/dx
but it would just mean x[loveheart]
I think
and no
sleep is for the weak
d/dx was part of either the chain, product or quotent rule. can't be more specific though, did it a while ago
good night everyone
i seeee
/me 7feels like she would rant any moment
?
07Okay.
07I like feesh
Oooook...O_o
10internet, TPBoD, talent and yaoi
10oh dear
07:p
07Lol
7The 'actual' title of TPBoD is The Rengades, but TPBoD fits more in my other anagrammed fanfics: ASoM and TLS. :P
http://xkcd.com/591/
7Yush, yaoi is strange, but unfortunately, that's a part of TPBoD. Not that I read it for that, 'course: I find the themes and character development scintillating.
10Yaoi....
10no comment
LOL
10LOLOLOL
10HAHAHA OH WOW
lol
10I can handle the "OH GOD" of the images, i just find yaoi to be ... well, silly
10@ BF's link
/me 7shrugs
10Anime boys.
7But, wow, I find it strange that TPBoD mixes yaoi, drama, and comedy in one.
7Especially chapter 13.
*^__________^*;;;;; ~~~
10rage
7Oh, and 12. Or was that 11?
lots of books have slightly adult themes
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant,_the_Unbeliever
you can haz
they're very good books
like TLotR in sort of scale
10:O
but uh, not the same
i.e. TCoTC has lepers
:D

07[01:09:46] <Quilava> greaat, a bunch of my bro's friends are in here <- How many are they?
um

all in this room >.>
Is it? O_o
07Or well, join address thing
Meh, that's a hostname. :P
07Oh. XD; *computer-fail*
XD, and yeah, it is pretty long.
07Well, alright :> Everything's sort of quiet around here.
you could share some of the loud and obnoxious over here <.<;
they're freaking loud..
07Ah
07I'm just reading articles again
07Out of curiosity
07Like?
07lol
/whois Quincunx
um. everything <.<;
/whois Quilava
07LOL 4chan, ED, odd things...? Lol
yes.
...Eurgh, 888chan.
Fail.
anything followed by 'chan' sucks
07Pretty much.
I'm afraid to go get something to eat
Sometime, I have to DDoS 4chan, 888chan, and ED.
that's not a good move >.>
07I don't like ED at all.
Why's that?
07I can ignore the chan's.
They can't do anything to me.
you sure about that?
Yep.
well hey, if you want, go ahead.
yeah, but trust me. it won't just be net raids if you really piss them off
How are they going to get my address?
I wouldn't know, but they've done it
The truth is the can't do anything.
07arf
they*
right.. then go ahead
The only problem is that DDoSing them is probably illegal.
Probably?
I am.
lol
The ONLY way I can get spyware from them is if I download something from them.
I'm not going to do that.
7meep
If you know half as much as you're implying, you know how weak that statement is from most people
Is a goldmine of information
If you know how to use it
And to connect the dots
Well you should see how much information you can get from me in a day.
It won't be much to go on.
Perhaps, but I'm not really into the information gathering, I kind of like the puzzles of it, and I can see how things connect together quickly
I was actually kind of disappointed.
/me pokes a mod
if you're that certian about this, you can go ahead, I'm not stopping you.
07arf
but if they do start getting crap on you, don't bring them here.

As I said, I'm pretty sure it would be illegal.
if you can't be traced like you say, why should that matter?
The government can trace you.
how does that work?
thanks
Aero's here
and whats to keep people from hacking the ISP to get the information?
They would have to be extremely proffesional, which none of them are.
07slap her
Aero: D:
7AERO
Aero: QUAN
...How would I piss off the police?
/me 7is currently reading TPBoD, and is at a Zexion chapter. Like you care. X3
07Uh..
Aero: XD
07Highly improbable though
I doubt any non-corrupt policeman would go on them.
/me 7then ponders if there are any Zero fanfics.
Aero: there's liek.... one. XD
7I find it a bit peculiar that all of the 'good' XIII fanfics have Vexen as a main character. Then again, I only have one in my uppermost tier of canon-connecting, eloquently stylized, plot-theme invoking fanfic.
Aero: What's 'canon'?
7In-storyline. :P
...oh crap... I HAVE to sleep in tomorow.
ugh
Aero: D: Why? Something happen?
07ew
yeah.. I can't come out here till they're all awake.
7Huh, this is the only fanfic I've ever read that scenes actually appear in my mind (except for, well, y'know. O_o). Other times, it's just auditory sensations. o.O
/me is sleepy
/me is starving.
07go get foods

o.o
bah, timing = fail

You are trying to go get food?

she would just walk back home

07glaskikgurmr
You need to eat when you're hungry >=[
I'd say the same.....but I can eat and eat without worry, for some reason I NEVER put on weight.
07There are times where I'll ravenously pounce food and eat like the worst pig ever
O.O;
07But that's rare nowadays
Well, if I wanted to. But you should eat when you are hungry and not forget >.<
i think food is amazing.
but i work in the food business. >_>
KYUK
-K
KYUUUUUUUUU
LOOK OUTSIDE
IT'S RAINING
8D
07I think I need to make it tastier. I think the food I have is too bland, and that's why I don't want to eat.
-v-;
yes. if you're going to eat, eat healthy amazing tasting food.
precisely.
And have burd cook something for you
07Tavy I might try to do that
07glaskikgurmr how do you combine healthy+good though? I can't make chinese foodstuffs which is the only place I find that combo.
I was going to grill it
07Tavy, anything you can recommend?
oh healthy+good is pretty easy
just make it flavourful
using spices and sauces
07I just had some cereal and I was all 'gruh' because I didnt want much after the first spoonful, but forced it down since I can't go another 24 hours without foods
07which I would've done if I hadn't eaten now
Curry could be a healthy+good thing.
and YES CURRY
07Yeh!
IS GOOD
CURRY
Curry is amazing
07loooooooooool icarly
i like indian foods
7...

07XD
/me runs
07and no LOL no arrow references, can't blame him really lol
7Nearly 40,000 characters.
i like all curry
Hmm, you're shipping something
And suggest.....hmm, I dunno tbh. My favourite dinners are things I think you can get anywhere like beef stew and such.
Is there anything you could cook
no limer
That would survive the traveling?
it takes weeks
for things to arrive
LOL
weeks and weeks
07Tavy!
07I was wondering
Nothing that would survive that at all?
my mum makes fantastic beef stew. <3
Hmm?
no, because i'm talking about soups
07Fish and chips any good?
or .. anything that isn't dry and packaged
ovo;
OvO;
ALTEH
07Gah glaskikgurmr I cant afford seeing you anytime soon
07are you afraid of pickles?
07XP
I was wondering something as well actually......and depends. It is good if you can find a good place to buy it from.
07then Leeds next summer
Leeds!
07Both trips I have to pay for myself and I'm unemployed x.x
i intend to go to you

IT SHALL HAPPEN.
This is burd we're talking about
4,14ALMOST 9000?!
07Oh glaskikgurmr, do you think you could give me some recipes of tasty and healthy foods?
She'll manage it
that's dangerous
07I could try learning how to cook actually for myself
07the food mum makes is starting to bore me, I really need variation..

It's not finished yet, either.
7Hmm. The ones from TPBoD vary from a few paragraphs, to as I mentioned, >8,000 word ones, JTLYK.
>.<
You need to use 00-15
ANd you need the 0 in front of the single digits
To make sure it works
/me 7curiously questions over the conclusion of the fic.

06LAWL.
7Which is exactly my point. I meant /actual/ mibbit, not SR's paranoid version.
06"All the cool Neopets wear bow ties. Duh."
They are both the ACTUAL thing.
7with SR's version you can't join channels, which was SR's main reason for making it different.
You can.
I did it on SR's version.
Abbey doesn't know how to join other channels.
7...true.

14I just checked, was telling Arti something
14Before I forgot.
14LOL Vyl
14thats an odd line
I dropped it.
Hey, did you guys have a Wolfenstein battle yet?
I read in the bath...
O_o

Was just wondering
Did schedule one for today, right?
/me exposes the book to high-intensity visible, IR and UV light. That should dry it.
Tis fine
14Articuno
...if the others were up for a battle we could possibly bring Arti in, if she was interested...
12prince-dari, I went on my first day there
14I can talk to you another time if you want.
12Signed a petition there too
Yeah, we donated some money.
14Solvalou, you scheduled it for the 19th .. but lol, I'm available today only as you know, Vyl also thought it was today
14so I could chew on him
14Arti is lonely/tired, dunno if she's up for it but you could ask.
14Cute_Riolu and Quilava?
I'd rather not bother her unnecessarily
14Best leave her then, I'm not sure how well she's feeling
12^^

Hi ABbey
:D
6quiet night then
14Indeed.
12I much prefer Scotland, there's no tourists but instead you got biting midges, thousands ofthem
6See ya soon!
nothing annoys me more than having some stupid farmer trying to sell me food at stupid prices becuase tourists are willing to pay that money
12kk
6sometimes thats good though lol
In France we got attacked by some weird yellow super-mosquittoes (sp?) in a nature reserve.
14O__o
14was he suppsed to return it like 10 years ago?!
14LOL
14lol
12That's the year I was born :O
And I don't WANT to know the fine XD
i mean, it's alright if you can afford it, but it generally just make a huge chunk of the county I live in quite inaccessible to the rest of us... :(
12Lol
12In Italy there's this thing called a banded mosquito I think, and it's really strong, I found one in England a couple of years ago, not good :/
not that there's anything wrong with tourists, it's just that they're dumb enough to pay theprices
But oh well, the book was worth 5.5 pounds back then ;>
14gah I typoed XD
/me is mosquito queen
...Queen? Lol.
And it is rather interesting that a lot of people here are over the age of 18 ;> Or 18 an over ;>
14Haharharha that book is older than me
14Nope.
well apparently everybody thinks i'm male
14:/
14Lugia why's that interesting?
You are that's why BFlol
12Cos we are all old....
14She left before I came on again.
:P
14Oh wait I'm not
He's a male at heart.
6ah gotcha ok
12I object! I know people older than me still interested in it.
14But this channel has no theme :P
14I like to have you here though ^v^
12with knives and othe.....OOPS not allowed to go into detail with that part....
lol XD
12Lol, and yeah but when we grew up liking it, it sticks
Well, they are forcing me to be here with the birdie boiler in that corner >> *points*
10So, BF's not male? That surprised me as well, LOL
14Well, Arrow and I are awesome.
yeah
14Admit it.

14That's why you're all here ;D
/me brick'd

/me holds up his wings
i dunno
I said nothing ^v^
but it is slightly amusing to see how many people can believe you're of the opposite gender
12LOL
14we could arrange something
12Hasn't Rex convinced people for a few years?
I get called 'he' sometimes here.
Well, all people have is the words you type, nothing else ;>
/me steps on Cute_Riolu and Quilava
o_O
14o-o
07yaay
Actualy I wouldn't mind being called it ;>
12no, I like being called "it"
/me superdances!
12lol Arti
12Stick a comma in there
~Articuno • Hasn't Rex convinced people for a few years? <-- i don't think he and Vicky tried to convince people as such
How did Nick react?
just changed their gender on their profile
could be wrong tho
lol, well, want a free target? ;p
erm people don't wanna know, Arti
/me runs
12FURFAGS XD
ovO Where is taht exactly...? on their chest...?
12Nope the neck

I'd have thought neck...
12We catch WAY too many birds
12Oh
Well, another young Peadge flew down our chiminey again today XD
12Guys
and gulls
12Nick had this great idea but dunno if it'll work..
12He's saying I should sell merchandise on TST
Awesome, that's a good idea.
12Since I don't have a job yet
That would be a great idea Arti!
12I would :D
I would
12Hmm ok..
12Let me tell you how much for a mousemat then.
12roughly
14Ok XD
also I had about 20 Articunos looking at me as I slept last night
12LOL!!!!
/me grins
14LOOOL
14did you count?
12how much, Arti?
12A3?
14Articuno i don't know honestly
14LOL A3 is HUGE
O_O
A3???
Gamers use A3 mousepads ;>
lol
O______________________o
They are really nice...
which is why I want one ;>
12o.o
14haha!
12Why?
12so?
People sell their fanart all the time though on DA
and FA
though*
Actually, they can.
Wow, that was a nice typo of though.
come to get you
12I can't move, they might hear me
It's probably someone wanted some sugar or tea
Paranoid Arti? o.o
14O.o
14Articuno
o_o
Me...? ;p
14speaking of being under dressed
12o.o
14I remember
12I cant open it anyway, unless I get dressed
12but then I'd wake up Xai
/me pets Arti
14i opened..
14but
14straight from the shower, most embarrassing moment ever
14z.z
I'm here <.<
I said before
Hey DRF.
hi Draelen
Only because they arn't worth the effort of enforcement :> It's still illegal.
12hai drf
*drfsupercenter
Piracy's illegal but it's fun.
14You up for it though?
14Lol
14you never replied
14glaskikgurmr!!!!!!!
But if you get into mousemats and such, that might attract attention. Could even be considered counterfitting.
12Just looked out the peek hole thing, it was some man I didn't know :/
I did.. <.<
12Couldnt have been important or he'd knocked again
interact*
12night LLotS~
night LLOTS
HAKIWE!JL!JL!JL!!
12Hawkie I remember that actually
12and Night LLOTS!
Night everyone ^v^ *hugs everyone*
14Quilava cant be worse than me
14Oh!!!!
12*huggles back*
14Skittles <3
you sure?
14Quilava yeh
14LOL
14Lol
12right, I'd have to charge at least 10 for a mousemat, that's nearly $20
12wow
12That doesnt include delivery
on the way home he would squawk every now and then and this lady walking in front of me kept looking around
she gave me the nastiest look O_o
14Ohh, you should film
14and why? O__o
14LOL
i have no idea
she was weird
12Delivery pushes it up 2 if you're in the UK :/
12More in the US
14I can imagine
12Say 4..
12at least
12I doubt anyone would buy at those prices :(
i wish i didn't need to rehome him ;_; i've kind of decided against an owner though
and i'm looking at zoos and aviaries
i want him in that environment
i think he would be happier
/me would buy one (if it knew how) :\
only 14 squid for a mousemat?
a lot happier than getting used to strangers >_>
1212 for UK
/me shivers
they're more expensive than that in a shop IIRC
12at least
12Are they?
14Oh really?
I'm not certain
/me looks around
I use no mousemat :>
well he would eventually
^
but they're just not.. stable enough
14they require stability
14Fickle things
i've contacted several zoos which said it wasn't possible, but that was just through email
14Oh?
14Why wouldnt it be possible?
14Yeah do that,
i dunno, against their policy or something
i mean it makes some sense, but ;_;
Ooh, posters. :o
Yeah, you have have nothing to lose really, you set up a page on the site, some one orders something, and you send it to them. XD
I WANT HIM IN A ZOO

I'll consider observing then Arrow. :)

I'd like a poster

03Indeed.
03Normal form looks overweight.
02i'm not talking about looks though
02i'm talking about stats
02the normal giratina is built to be defensive
02while the origin form is just a scary attacker
03Hmm...
2LOL
02the one downside to origin form in my opinion
03Good point.
02lol

02now to get to giratina
04I have 1300 health, and they hit 40-80 damage twice in a turn

04Not to mention I was on half Health

12prince-dari, no matter how often I say chavs must die etc. I never actually mean it, it's no loss if they DO die, but I don't think people should be sentenced to it for one murder. It should be thought over very very carefully
6Can't kiss her

I know that.
and tonight I'm likely to be out
14i got two girls to kiss once in S2P

7Abbey: I have emotions, and we have abrasive personalities.
14That's not a reason D:
they could have added as much as they wanted in any of the ingredients though
14Come on, one thing.
7No, it's two.
14Two things then.
7I gave you two. Or one, if you don't like the first.
14That's not a reason D:
Well that site says the chocolate is completely sugar free.
14You weren't like this when you first came here :3
lol
hi Quilava

12Yes thats a really good idea
12Here's some grapes

/me screams
12FINALLY
12Yes
6that legs bugs me
I rather like it
6but yes, that's the best one ever
like I said, it remineds me of the Silver's
12Yeh it does look a bit bent upwards
its sprite is nearly the same since RS+
expect at a different angel
12Oh, lets see..?
k
k
uploading
6ho-oh always has the same sprite basically
6!lag
6:/
6D:
6!lagcount
6ovo
not really
6!lag
D:
since RS its had the same pose and everything
HGSS' changes it slightly
6well, I mean from RSE/FRLG/DPPt
6oh good
http://i25.tinypic.com/34i5kkz.jpg
12<__<
6O_O
12Yeh thats REALLY disappointing
6LOL SPREAD-EAGLE
12However
12The Gyarados sprite is wonderful, and the animation
6Similar. ovo
its not exactly the same of course
http://pkmn.net/?action=dex&page=pokemon&id=250
6it looks painfully spread
6arti, where is the gyrados animation?
6I only saw a picture
12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3807.0
12The link in there
the layouts have changed slightly
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=89941.0 check it
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=89941.0 and this
..
uhh
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=88554.0
yeah
12Yay apricorns
the animation
6it fits
just two sprites
6..
6that killed it
Hai Altair~
6I'm still buying it, but that animation killed many of my hopes
Heya Aero~
hallos
i won't mind
if you can switch them off
gyarados
6it's 2-frame
12I know it's not
12http://pokemonelite2000.com/sprites/emesprani/emesprani130.gif
6oh well, there's enough packed into this for me to like it still
12That looks nothing like the Gyarados animation for HGSS..
no I meant its the the same style as Emerald's
also
6No, Arti, as in there's only two frames, with lots of modifications to 'em.
12Oh
I shall be importatning the Japanese versions
would you like a few pages releated to them
12Er Ledyba
Er Ledyba
12XD
I CAN READ JAPANESE
12lies

12lolz
Hello everyone.
/me 2changes to blue
12this one.
7That was unnecessary
There are cases of swine flu at my school.
Although we have to come in anyway.
7Four in mine. We're a shit school.
12Really? I thought Swine Flu was gone and passed.
...
/me randomly huggles everyone
12Oh.
4...
/me huggles back
12And why are you guys in school? It's summer.
7Not my fault if I'm iggerant.
For Americans.
7We're in england.
14o-o
7Not everyone lives in the cheap england knock-off.
14Swaffy.....
12That sucks.
12Hello.
7America no longer has a name besides Cheap England Knock-off.
12It's Obama's fault.
...
12He sucks.
No, but what's his fault?
7EVERY world leader sucks.
4http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stufffff/Say_AAAAAAAAAH.png
7Fixing George Bush's mistakes, no?
7Bush was an idiot.
12Just to begin...
And Americans voted him in twice...
7Obama is trying his hardest bless him. *has always wanted to say that*
7Oh for fuck's sake.
7NO-ONE CARES ABOUT RELIGION. YOU WANNA CARE ABOUT RELIGION, INVENT A TIME MACHINE AND GO BACK 200 YEARS.
7Bush has NEVER made a good choice.
I like that choice.
12And leave the Iraqui civilians to be terrorized?
12*Iraqi
7It's their mother-fucking country. Leave the bastards alone.
...The Iraqi government (or whatever) said they could handle it.
12America has always helped other countries in need.
7No, they've always rammed their cocks into countries too weak to resist, to puff themselves up.
7If you ever stop because of cock-burn, you'll realise you've alienated everyone else.
12I'm surprised our Allies have not entered the war to help. Yet there's that World War issue.
7AHA
7I SAW IT COMING.
Vyl, PM?
12Britain and America fought side-by-side in WWII. We won a greater part of the war, but could not make it without our Allies.
12We also joined in on WWI, because our friendly countries needed help. Their troops were being outnumbered.
7We were winning.
12Tanks were being blown by artillery.
14-.-
7I once read a book on WWI. Chapter Five was the world at war. Chapter 11 was "Here come the yanks."
7Chapter 12 was victory.
7Coincidence, or glory-stealing?
12We kicked their asses.
7You bastards must feel proud.
12All anybody wanted was to get that war over with. Even the Allied countries sought for help to end the war quicker.
2b
*wb
12lol
7We were nearly finished. Another punch and they'd be down. But you came in and did it for us, and expect thanks.
7I think it was Rosavelt.
7Or that might have been WWII
12Roosevelt did a lot of good things for our country.
12I think it was WWII.
ffs...
7Irregardless. We were nearly finished. Another punch and they'd be down. But you came in and did it for us, and expect thanks.

Hey.
I need advice
02hmm
A friend of mine is banned from a channel for reasons I'm unfamiliar with. He's really nice and he seems well behaved, but as said before, he's been banned.
/me nods
Well I would have thought the best thing to do first would be to find out why he was banned.
02that seems like the most reasonable thing to do
02being a friend and unbanning him wouldn't really be the answer
12Whos banned now? XD
02another server
12Good
02hmm
I already did
Oh.
02that doesn't sound very reasonable
02what happens in one channel, happened in that channel only
02it shouldn't effect or concern say 5 or 6 other channeld
02s
'k, well I'm trying to get him in now

12Hi Charzard03 :>
hai guys ^-^
Hey Charzard03
07hi!
07I am here
oh hai arti! i went somewhere you would like today
oh hello there
have you ever visited paridise park when you lived in the south west?
7Tommy!
12No
12I've never actually heard of it
12Where is it?
its in cornwall in hayle
12Hayle, nah I rarely went there :>
Is it a national park?
its a sanctuary for birds
12O__o really..? I'll have to visit then
-.-
7I have a great memory for punishment.
they have tons of different birds there, i think you would really like it
That would be fun I went to the Artic Circl in Alaska once and they had tons of strange birds and animals
I noticed -_-
they had this bald eagle that they rescued from a animal smuggler that couldnt go back in the wild
but you still don't remember why though
12Wow Ovo
http://www.paradisepark.org.uk/
there we go
The link works
This is good I'm trying to get a list of places I should vist when I go to Europe one day
10I CAN'T DRAAAAAAAAAAAW
/me dies

12Thanks for the link

Yep
i dunno, i just...drew it
Strangely I can take something all ready drawn and change them into differnt body postors and make their mouths move using a mix of photo delex and movie maker
i can never explain how i draw things, i just do
Yesterday I finnly made my own version of Articuno's anthro cuno girl looking towards the screen
It was hard work too
link?
Beaten D:
erm....
Thank you I really don't much about the computer words or code

laaaaaaaaaaaag

10eew
i gtg now guys
cya
My computer strangely likes loading this website faster then my own home page Comcast aka Comslow

/me pokes Quil..
/me pokes to nicklist
hi
Hello.
Me too all I know is it comes with plugging the TV
10hi
10wat?
Comcast bundle thing.
Talking about ISP.
10Ok seriously
10wtf
I like mine, and wb.
10My ISP is awesome
10but my router is crap I suppose
10ty
Railroader is driven nuts daily about his ISP
I mean, other than some modem troubles we encountered some time ago, the AT&T DSL we get is good :D
10We have the same thing
Then we'd have to unplug it and let it cool.
10Well, we got it before Bellsouth became AT&T
etc.
10o-O
We had dial-up for a long time
10:C
10We got rid of dial-up in 2002
Strangely the boxes and wires on the side say Bell South on them
10I think
We weren't able to UNTIL that time
10Ah okay
Where at I live in a suburb
I live in a surburb
sburb?
10I live slightly north of the main city
A suburb of Richmond
10Railroader same here
10Of course, our power goes out all the time
I live in middle-of-nowhere, IN
I drive though that state sometimes on the way to Chiacgo
10I live in NC
03Back~
swb
Strangely if I were to go though a town or state I would be able to know if I'm home or not based off how the power line power poles look like
You sometimes go through IN?
10Rage.
To get to Chicago.
From Richmond.
Why would you go another way?
Indiana
...
I'm just wondering which way you take not to go through IN.
Meh, never mind.
10this is just stupid
Having fun?
8D
Instersate 65 and 70 and though Indainapolis
Indianapolis = sometimes called the racing capital of the world. :D
Oh, and I live in 'that state'
:D
It's still nice to go though
Define 'trolls'
I know that definition.
I've never seen or heard that term used that way.
And he was in the left passing lane all ready as if 75 though the mountains wasn't fast enought for him
Look!

Ovo
It's "Lay" not "Lie"
Lie is the present tense, the past tense makes more sense
02Lay is like "I lay this down." Lie, "I went to go lie down"
LAY AND LIE ARE THE MOST CONFUSING WORDS IN THIS LANGUAGE.
Guest maybe?
D:
02Who and whom are too
lol Ragnarok
I agree
with who/whom and lay/lie
and stuffs
02They're, their, there :3
02To, two, and too :P
They're, their, and there are the easiest set or words.
of*
To me, they are.
the there's are easy
It's and its are very commonly misused.
It's = it is, its = possessive form of it.
Alot is also used as one word a lot...
02English is just plain confusing
wait...
It's its toy.
8D
o_O
Which is correct.
Oh
Because it is its toy, being that 'it' in this case means two things, one the toy, the other the owner of the toy.

Heh, I'm listening to Machinae Supremacy's "SIDstyler" myself :P
07Never heard of them.
6Gawd
www.machinaesupremacy.com
2o.O
6-______-
They did the soundtrack for Jets'n'Guns, and their track "Cryosleep" was used in one of the In The Groove games (I want to say it was ITG2)
07Are you misspelling machine or is that A supposed to be there?
6*the
It's supposed to be there, somewhataskew. It's how the band itself spells the name :D
6Now I kinda can't breathe again
07Ok, just checking for when I look it up later.
6STUPID
6FUCKING
6SMOKE
6D<
07Im listening to the SPAWN soundtrack now. "Trip like I do"
2O_O
6Ok,now I need to stick my head in the fridge again..
6D: @ Dari
Apparently they already have something sorted though.
2o.O

2o.O
Oh, one of my favorite Machinae Supremacy tracks just came on . . .
6Ok..this is getting worse..
2o.O
6I need to go to the fridge..
Well, on the also-not-so-bright side, you might not have to wait until 18, with all the smoking they do.
07Sneaker Pimps, "Spin,Spin Sugar"...Deftones, "My Own Summer"...Drowning Poll, "Tear Away" to name a few.
07*Pool
6lol
6XD
I meant him, but yeah, passive smoking too, I suppose.
6He doesn't even believe I have a problem
2Problem?
07The first one is more techno than hard but they're all cool. And still producing hits now.
6He says that I only complain about not breathing well when everyone else can't breath well either,because of the heat
2Do you have asthma?
6Well at points I kinda have a hard time breathing..
07Those particular songs are around 10 years old though.
6I had it when I was six but that was because of the really low tempature
6I think this thing has to do with their smoking though..
6Wait..
6brb
6Better
07"Mouth" by Bush now.
07Where did everybody go?

He's about four feet tall to the shoulder, with his wings out-stretched, about nine feet.
Full name: Ika Nurabashi Kyuu
You don't want to know his story.
Wow, quite a lot of information.
It would take YEARS to write
XD
And thanks
10Of course, it's birds only, since I can't draw anythin else
Ika's iris's are a light grey, by the way.
I think I have his story written down somewhere
*Looks*
Hm...
Oh yeah

I forgot
Family?
Uh....
Yeah
I know all his family

Twenty-something, why?
12Oh, okay. Good.
I've worked out that when accused of something, if you get really pissed off quickly, then people think you are lying.
Yeah, basically we were gonna came out in a place, then he wanted to go somewhere else because there was wi-fi, lol.

06I like Dragcave more than Valenth.

Never saw it.
12Yes, there was.
06Just views and unique views.
12I've played it ... it's pretty cool.
07it's the same thing
06No.
02Chaining is for showing off shinies :D guess that's attention too
Awesome.
Well, I'll be right back.
06Chaining is for FINDING shinies.
07you can't view without clicking a link
06So?
/me steals slifer back
06You can only view by going to a scroll.
02You find the shinies then you show them off, it all "links" together *shot*
06NOT the egg/hatchling itself.
/me steals Slifer again

Amazing how stupid he was.

07Slifer is an executive producer
07XD
06Ovo
02The main character used him all the time. And in Yugioh GX the main character was in the Slifer dorm for the entire season
06No he's not.
6THAT'S fun, but the overall idea is horrible
06D:<
12Yes.
07they changed the name
06No.
06Slifer.

12Wrong.
02Why do I keep mixing up Obelisk and Exodia?!
No, right.
6Obelisk
6shiny exactly
6I did the same thing, resulting in me not remembering the name
12How retarded.
How would you know? Have you got an itemized bill of everything the money was spent on?
12Bush knew how to deal with the war correctly, and by not using up a whole lot of funds.
12Wrong again. The terrorists did.
13Wow, are you guys seriously fighting over that

12The wrong religion. Muslims and Aetheists.
07Bakura's monster blasted Slifer's head off
07XD
Well yes, it causes quite a lot of wars, but it's more of an excuse for war, rather than the cause, the causes are mainly greed for land.
10HO-OH

I've decided to entertain myself by tipping my chair back as far as it can without hitting the floor.
12lolz
I've decided to torture myself till I got mad, then the voices can entertain me.
Yes.
iScribble kept signing me off.
The voices never leave, and they got dreadfully boring after a while.
And satirical, strangely.
Oh, that's disappointing.
02Let's make a tower :D *shot*
no, it wont be the last
02I'm sure :/
13Why?

About the voices or the satire?

Both sorta.

9I'd rather be at something boring than at home
I'd just sell the tickets, loll.
depends on how active the forum is to a degree
13then why didn't you go
Of course! The thingy!
9Aicebo: In a feud with them

And when he doesn't stay away, he criticizes me for not having the need-to-belong gene.
Hm, my mum told me about a pretty screwed up film a while ago.
Called Sophie's Choice.
Which includes, but is not exclusive to a woman having to choose which one of her children dies.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie's_Choice_(film)
And dad's jealous
9What?
Never mind.
Sometimes I don't make sense.
13makes sense to me
No one in their right mind could always be positive on this planet.
Or their left mind.
9I know.
Oh, how the turntables have... turned?
13huh?
/me always has the weirdest tendency to laugh when people are mad.
13if they are turning they're turning awfully slow
Which usually makes them madder.
Which means I laugh more.
Which usually makes them madder.
In which case I laugh morre.
And around and around
Lol

9Aicebo: No, then you kick it
Yeah.
13How about you kick it
13I punched them before you
I suspect that would be lust of the eyes.
13:P
I think it's when two people make eye-contact and hold it, or something.
13okay
A punch from shulk to a baby? Nasty.

07Hi sorry

I think Ninetails never really showed up as a main character?

Quan?

And she lived in an illusion of a manion

7Gosh dangit, it's still at 4,999 views. XD
Railroader, that's the one I was referring to'
02Kipikipo
02it's back up
Okay
Strangely I think that was based off the legendery story Lady Ren
Makes sense.
Strangely he's not mad at her and runs into her a week later and tells her that she is really a fox a
Is there a moral?
When he tells her she's a fox she tells him that she wouldn't do anything to him that other foxes would do and some how ends up marring her
/me yawns
-c
The lession would be try to get to know as much as you can about someone?
And how is that portrayed inthe story? :3
/me pets Railroader
Interesting.
Fantastic.
Wait...
ninetails*
7Lots of things from Japan are borrowed from the Chinese.
Really?
7Just take a look at its language!
I... guess... XP
They are creatures such as Ninetails are in Japan and Lady Ren would be one of them too
But China's been closed off for such a long time, I didn't think their myths and legends could spread'
Seems I was wrong
It must have been there for thousands of years becouse I think Japan went into Isolism from the early 1500's to 1853

7You have no common sense.

10she had to do meps
she could be doing a wide variety of things
10she had to do meps
9Btw, was she annoying?
7Probably abusing her powers somewhere else.
7How can no-one in my house smell that smoke?
lol
9She keeps on telling me to ask
lmso
10imso?
10o-o

Kjackings would do just fine as a moderator
6Kja, if you was a mod/admin here there wouldn't be much people coming here xD Every day a banning spree...
"kjakings"
9I'm on Hail's side...for once
10xDDD

I'll take it

thanks
STRAWBERRIES.
7There was the time she got pissed off because dari said homosapien.
9She doesn't do the former
"Vienna - it's like Paris minus French people"
or something to that effect
7Magikal: She doesn't when you're on here.
She has done those things
9No, but she isn't like that.
brb
doesn't matter if that isn't how she's like
06Sky? Ovo
she can't control her emotions
9I can see her getting pissed at 'homo sapien', though
that pretty much voids it
7Magikal: Yes she does.
6Peh... I was harmless back then too..
06Read #Neopets, Cynder
9I know that.
Seaman Stanes
6MSN RPing ftw X}
9She doesn't talk like that
6Magi? Then she laughs at herself? ;o
it's a cartoon show you nitwit
6Brb! I have to switch pc's T.T
7Now answer the point, not how I typed it.
6So.. Bai!
oi
7Yet she still kicked dari.
7Why? Because she likes to abuse her power.
7It's like Ayumi wanting special credit because he's autistic.
9Well I don't see why she wouldn't abuse it all
9If she did
7Neither do I. But regardless, she abuses her power here. She can't keep her emotions in check, and any time anyone confronts her about it, she flaunts /being_bullied/ like a shield, as if no-one else in the world had been bullied, and then kick/bans them if they're below her in power.
9She doesn't use being bullied as an excuse
7Oh yes she does.
7But she does it subtly.
7She tells everyone about it, and then implies that it's her excuse whenever anyone confronts her.
9Well on other sites she doesn't.
other sites are not the point
7well other sites is NOT THE POINT.
7HERE is the point.
9*other sites
7Other sites are NOT THE POINT. That's three times.
9Fine, I get it. The Spyro site logo brings back memories of suffering for her.
9Sorry.
7Oh no. I'd like to hear that story.
7And the explanation as to why she doesn't leave spyro alone if it brings back memories of suffering.
wtf
9Sardonic joke.
7I see.
GUEST
7Any other points, or are we willing to admit defeat and allow me to move on to other things I have to do in the next hour and a half?
9I surrender.
7Thank you. I'm glad you did it graciously and allowed the three of us involved to retain our dignity.

Hello?
/me freakin' loves Bubbles' transformation X-x
My Father rode around on the train system when he visted there in the 1970's
narrow gauge? Only rarely and in village use in fact
Hmm ...
what?
not even streetcars. they also use standard gauge
Richmond Vriginia used to have a vast Streetcar system but they ripped it all up in 1949

Where the Streetcars in Germany used none stop form the 1900's to 2009?
05wow... powerpuff girls Z... weird...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_KGudgz5_4&feature=related its just not right >.<

and something even more exotic: http://lh4.ggpht.com/_CTLjqd1SqGg/SRatX29WaAI/AAAAAAAAArg/WeFTKgOIK9w/DSC_1056.JPG
7Yeah Arti made that Cynder
The link didn't pop up

That looks very neat how it is over the river
05hey

/me pets the pet whom does not want to be pet, the silly little pet
/me is shot

06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/LugiaSketch.png
The trains in Germany were built in the 1900's and lived though and are in heathy shape in 2009 which means the've gained vaule like a house
that's good Cynder!
06:D
06Thanks.
/me high-wings, "good job!"
/me coughs
02Very nice
In Norfolk Viringia the streetcars lived from 1880 then died in 1949
/me notes the sarcasm in both of the compliments :3
/me is shot
no, I actually think it's good
want to hear and see a sample of our interurban trains Railroader?^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agtCkdY62os
those announcements are always and automatically made prior whilst approaching a stop within the train
/me is coughin from breathin problems =.=
I favorited it If the streetcar system would have lived none stop like in germany it most likely would have only cost the city 120 millon to take of the system and extend it to the surburbs
the cities are STILL extending the suburb tubes here
/me is making her left wing on Photoshop ATM X3
yeah
Washingtion Metro is trying to build a 30 mile subway line to the Dullis Airport but it costing about 3 billon dollars
and that's the main problem: The work they need to do causes....quite....traffic problems
Are they using old fashion cut and cover tunneling?
the current project they're realizing in Dsseldorf is around 550 million euros
06=3
/me is done already
05i cannot open the picture
02Want to see my failure with the mouse?
/me makes her right wing next :D
sure
XD
That's good that they are extending the system to keep up with the growing suburbs here it would be ten times harder in that we have to rebuild the old systems first before we can go out again
06XD

/me doesn't
02I usually draw and scan ;3
02Hey Sammacha, you still hunt shinies?
06Done with the right wing.
06:D
The people in Norfolk are screaming murder about them spending money return the streecar to it's native habait
06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/ContradictionRightWing.png
06It's only slightly smaller than my left wing in real size, though. X3
06Beach?
06Bleach?
06BLEACH?!
06BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEACH.
06<3
well, the airport's there since 1895 - being a former zeppelin airport
10o_O
those people bought their land close to the airport around 1950 to 1960, built houses on it...and complain about the airport being too loud...
02wb Aero
how sick is that, eh?
same here
hi Ecco
I learned about the BIGGEST of ALL jokes at the university^^
people are quite unsure regarding radiation of mobile phone masts, you know?
several people tried to sue the mobile phone companies for potentially causing cancer
I kind of think they might do something to people they put them on apartement buildings in the poor nighboor hoods in Richmond
7FPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPT.
Thanks Sammacha
7I'm back.
wb Quan o_O
02Lol
02Sand?
/me flees
A shell!
7YUSH.
oh
02A...shell!
7Actually, I found a Horseshoe Crab. :P
02:P
the people complained due to a piece of metal standing somewhere - without ANY wires being put at it...
06Nomnomnom.
06:D
That is a good rule it makes it safter if one of them falls over
07lol
07i'd think most states would have the sense to have that rule
few do here. They're strictly maintenanced. Especially since the last blackout after a severe snowfalls in 2007
7Brbzors.
05ZAP!!
02kkzorz
A lot of the poles around here are rotted out wooden high votlage ones form the 1950's on their last leg
03lksdholsidgd
There is a type of insulator hunting I thought of that helps keep the lights on
07uh
07the metal ones are for longer distance power transfer
07oh lol
07that doesn't sound safe at all
most of them here look like this: http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Magazine/emags/epublic/2006/044/Medien/hochspannungsmast,property=poster.jpg
/me sees the channel is still in one piece :)
with smaller village variants like this: http://view.stern.de/de/picture/1236064/Sonne-hochspannung-Hochspannungsmast-Hochspannungsmasten-Hochspannungsleitung-Sonnenblitz-Schwarz-510x510.jpg

and hello DragonWarriorKittion
? wat are you talking about?
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Elbekreuzung2.jpg
this one here :P
The 765's carry six wires on each line
well, I'm not an expert on all of this. But I think it's quite interesting
06holy crap! that is huge!
as I said: 226 meters / 740 feet
06excuse my languge
already excused
How many times a year do you lose power Time Shift?
err...I can't remember when we lost power the last time here
hrm...I think I had a blackout...hrm...in 1996?
06i was born in 96
well, THAT's why all our power lines are five times redundant :P
Our last power knock out was in Feb when several massive trees fell into our power lines from our nighboors our house went down to 31F

07well, altering it in any way that's not available during normal gaming
2hm
Definition of hack: "Informal To alter (a computer program): hacked her text editor to read HTML."
07it may not fit into the normal definition of hack, but it's still altering something
Oh well, people are wrong. :)
I am wrong, just not about this.
07hacking and altering are different things, but it's still lumped together into "cheating"
07XD
2Well, we both thick we're right, and that the other is wrong; hence, we're both both right /and/ wrong

Fair enough, lol.

2:O
2It just... does
Right, but that doesn't change the fact he likes being a cleric. I can understand how the "loyal" part of it is kinda weird, but at the same time, you can't stop someone from liking something
I wasn't talking about him liking clerics.

Their pizza sauce doesn't, at least
02what i should do is bring some tabasco with me to that league XD

I like my pizza simple. Usually just pepperoni, though sausage is good too
Well, Rocky's does it well

Rick Astley did a concert here last night
12OMFG

12ALL OF WHITEHAVEN HAS BEEN RICKROLLED XD

12Nethertown?
mothertown, silly way of saying Whitehaven
Nethertown
12Weeeird
I think I went there once for a barbeque
it was... fun
12Then we watched the meteors
ended up on a trampoline with a bunch of people I didn't know
and ya
I had my window open to watch them
12Omg ST Bees is amazing though
12Does it normally have like, NO tourists?
well
12Because it was strangely quiet..
I don't really know, I don't go there very often tbh
12lol ok
12Well we really loved it
I would presume that if the place you went to was fully booked... it might be a sign
12Yeh but that was because of the concert apparenty
12*l
12O__o?
aaaasdfg
12I have no idea, there wasn't anyone in St Bees

I've a good family.
I think that people are straying from morals too much.

6dari, I read something like that too
I don't speak in absolutes. D:

2Want some tips?
6tips?

Sure?
6late
2LOL
More descriptive?
2otherwise, its kind of creepy; like, "I just met this person, and they now have it in their head that they're my best friend. O_o'' "
I haz I writing sample :D
6Well, a decent rp post is about 4-5 lines in length. Try to balance between dialogue and description, as just pure one or the other is boring. Too often do I see pure dialogu
6never rush things. Let it all play out over a series of posts, not just three or four.
2:3
2XD Sure!

I really don't know XD
6we need to start that collab fic
/me 6goes off topic
2XD Yeah
07Hm
6anyways, in rps, you can't really describe scenes. Because everyone is involved, they all need to ship in
Collab fic?
6chip
6dugdg
6Ika, yea
6like an rp, but not
07I feel like sharing a writing sample now
07Oo
Then it was probably a fanfic.

Or just part of a story.
2XD
07More for feedback cause i feel like I could improve.

It doesn't do anything
10MSN Plus
6i dont know really
10If you get it.
10:3
6i havnt worked it out yet
10Want the link to MSN plus?
Sure
10Its MSN plus.
10;D
10and scripts.
6*facepalm*
10http://www.msgplus.net/
10just download it
10and you'll see the colors.
10:3
Eh
I already downloaded live
10><
And I can't figure out how to get rid of the old version
10download MSN Plus.
Three versions might be a bit too much :P
Tried Add/remove?
Yes
It doesn't show up there...
10Download it here..http://download.live.com/Messenger?CMXID=2120.6659E8F5-0797-4FA5-978A-17A208C59AFB&WT.srch=1
It's annoying because it always signs me in automatically when I start my computer
10its an addon
10mhm.
10Right click.
10Exit.
10O:
10Ah.
10Nevermind.
Ok...
Shouldn't it have uninstalled the old version when I downloaded Live?
It said it was going to =/
10Uhmm
10I dunno.
10Click start.
10All programs
10Look for "windows live"
10Hover over it
10Try that.
10It didn't uninstall the old MSN version on my comp.
10So mabye not on yours either :O
I found it
10Who cares about the downloading >:3
C:\Program Files\Messenger
10: D
10YOU WIN.
Lol.
10:>
10Does it look like that?
10But..
10Lol that's a skin from MSN Plus
10O:
6?
Yeah that's it
I just downloaded it a couple weeks ago
10Yay.
10You're safe.
10O:
Not yet
Lol, ok.
Oh right.
I chose easy subjects. :)
6lol history is easy for me :), just my hand writing is crap
6and ive found out the cause of it, i hav dspraxia
Lots of writing = time consuming = not easy
6*dyspraxia
I've never heard of that before.
6nor did i tell my mate laura told me about it, shes got it to, it explains my rubbish memory to
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_dyspraxia
6some of the things in it are related to me, but ive just got dspraxia, not developmental of it
How did you find out that you had it?
6my friend laura, shes got it, her hand writing isnt that good to, but shes got different symptons to me
6she told me about it and i looked at it and noted the ones that applied ot me
10At least you don't have.
/me 10gulps.
10PKU
10I have it.
10I HATE it.
6PKU?
10People treat me differently because of it.
6what is it
10http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria
6ah gotcha
The deficieny of an enzyme? Surely that's like people with diabetes cannot produce enough insulin.
They use bacteria to make insulin.
Can't they make this enzyme?
I was asking Hail, since she can't eat much of foods with that in, I thought she'd know.
6lol fair point kk
6yeh
O_o
wth is that?
6my school is one of only 4 schools in england with a farm attached to it
6working with animals, cattle, tractors and plants
Oh.
6to put it bluntly
Cool.
How many options were you allowed to choose for GCSE?
6lol
Lol.
6er
6cant rememer hang on
6on top of the compulsory ones
6so 5 i was allowed to choose
6lol unlucky, i choose against neighter i did languages up until year 9 then quit
6what u doing for GCSE?
I am doing Latin, Tech (electronics), and Economics.
6cool, i didnt know latin was still being taught though
Only at grammar schools really.
6ah gotcha, that makes sense
10Prince-dari..
10Seriously.
10I can't name all of them.
10I can name a couple.
Just give an example.
10A LOT of gums
10Some candies
10I can't have much protein..
10Im allergic to seafood
10and..
10nuts
Hm.
10Nuts, seafood, phenyalaine, and i cant have much of milk or eggs
10And lots more..
Gums is definitely not a word.
10I have to get stabbed in the foot
10every month if my level is low
10every 2 weeks if it is high
XD
/me 10sighs.
10I am angered easily.
And now I get to correct you.
to*
:P
10EVERY day..
Swahili?
10:P
10Gum
Not a spelling mistake, a word usage mistake.
Like Hail's.
10Spelling mistake.
10O:
But yeah, my mistake.
10TYPO.
10O:
10Ever heard of it?
No.
It's not in my vocabulary.
10Niiice.
10Look it up then.
10(;
/me EXTEMPORANEOUSLY looks it up.
...O_o
It's an inside joke.
That bothers Hail.
Which makes it decent.
10Nah.
10It doesn't bother me.
10Idc.
10Whatever it means Idc.
10<::>
Lol.
Seriously. I rarely see the two apart.
Or three, interchangibly.
Oh, crap. Egan is abroad. I'm laing low...
*laying
If Egan is abroad, then why do you need to lay low?
Because if she's abroad, the opposite would be below... well, in some ways,
Ok.
*.
Define GCSE.
10I hear it in rap songs yah.
10Wth.
-in*
10I think.
10Isn't it?
10:|
Honestly, no I don't.
Decenter...?
10LEAVE MY ENGLISH ALONE.
10T___T
There's no thirteenth grade in the US, but yeah I get it now.
Oh, I see, Hail decided to experiment with a nonexistent word. :P
Anything else is a fail.
10Peanuts are good.
10:3
You get homeschooled too?
I'm not right now.
I have been in the past.
Hail: I thought you couldn't eat nuts?
^ Good point
There are mastery tests or aptitude tests, but I'm not sure if there are things you can take that would be specifically for jobs, but there easily could be.
*silence
Pwn't.
:P
*
Well, through a lens darkly but more now.
*retake
I think you can go back and retake them, yeah.
Although you have to pay to do it.
quantum mechanics*
Mhm. Makes sense to me. And also I was reading this Curious Events book, and it said that at UCL the corpse of Jeremy Bentham is present at main meetings and otherwise rests in the main hallway or soemthing.
I lol'd. Much.
UCL?
Oh.
Lol.
And I guess a lot of students pranked it and stole his head.
LOL
"In use" Lol.
And when he's in a minute, he's listed as "Present, but not voting."
*meeting
Why did I say minute? Lawl.
Lol, yeah that doesn't really make sense, the keys are no where near each other.
10O: Hamster.
10Heheh.
Hamsters are probably the stupidest rodents of all.
10Not when I have them.
10No actually.
No they aren't.
10My hamster got out 5 times already.
Rats are clever.
10And, there was duct tape on the cage.
10Each time.
- for rodents
He got out that many times? Proves my point./
Now way he's gonna survive for long out of that cage.
10She
10They are naturally born loners.
Whatever, she. :P
Rats are pretty cool, my friend has a few.
*their
Oh, and the fact that the hamster escaped it just because you have a crappy cage.
10They are adorable too.
10 8D
It probably came loose about 5 minutes after you stuck it down.
/me sighs.
XD
10U-U
Cute things ~= Stupid things
10I don't need reasons for my beleifs.
:P
Yes you do, if you are going to disagree with us when we say hamsters are stupid.
I don't want to hear about these 'beleifs'.
10My beliefs are.
10Hamsters are adorable.
That's one...
10Hamsters ARE intelligent.
That doesn't make them clever.
No they aren't.
10Hamsters are actually clever and intelligent
Those both mean the same things.
10If they were dumb they wouldn't get out of their cage
10:P
Hail: We've been over this, if you can't muster a single reason then why prolong it?
Yes they would.
And they're dumb because they try to leave the cage.
10No, because if they are stupid, how would they know how?
It's pretty simple Hail.
10You're not changing my mind.
Animals have instincts, not necessarily good ones.
Take lemmings.
10So please stop trying
10(=
Their instincts effectively manage their population.
They gnaw it till they bleed.
It opens.
10http://spyroisadragony12345.deviantart.com/art/Lifes-Easy-When-You-Are-A-Ham-135881934
10It sucks but
And mice can get as flat as they need to, pretty much.
*how
10Hamster also can.
Read the above.
:/
10I once put her into this colorful cage.
10She unlatched it too.
10U_U
:P
10But, some are.
10;D
10She used her teeth to unlatch it.
10O.O;
10Well eventually all hamsters get out of those colorful things easy.
...
Hail may be the worst debater I've ever met.
10http://www.petsathome.com/Assets/PetsAtHome/products/1/4/0/14041_l.jpg
But it's giving me some good laughs.
10Only, wider.
10(:
10That's the cage.
...
hamster*
10She also climbs good O.o;
climbed*
10I'll show you her REAL cage.
That's a freakin' playpen, Hail.
I had that thing too.
LOl.
10Thats her pen..
She climbed out.
10How come it was locked then?
10And then it was unlocked with about an inch open
10and she was out of it
Simple, you're lying. :)
10When I came back.
Or she made up the whole situation, haha.
Hamsters don't have the ability or strength to lift that.
10I should totally fking of took pictures.
And you could have opened it yourself.
10>_>
:P
10I'm going to play with her right now.
Lol.
That still doesn't make them clever.
10^^; Please, never try again.
Kidding.
And we didn't try to make you dislike hamsters.
Just make you see the sense that they are NOT clever.
10Well you cant change that either
10I'll bring her down her
10*here
10One sec
Yes, there are some poeple too stupid to learn. :(
Lol.
That doesn't even make sense. It'd be like canineslaughter.
Bargain hunters, lol.
O_o
6Doowowowowooo
But since the Native Americans didn't really understand how a person could own land any more than air, they wanted it back.

Ok, that's pretty good for a web client.

10o_o'
mIRC is basic
mIRC isn't very "pretty" graphically, but I like it.
10O;
10Should I download mIRC?
10._.;
You don't need its other functions.
KVIRC is crazy though
10Hmm

In this context the US passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856 giving citizens discovering a source of guano the right to take possession of unclaimed land and entitlement to exclusive rights to the deposits. However, the guano could only be removed for the use by citizens of the United States.[2] This enabled US citizens to take possession of unoccupied islands containing guano.
Greedy Americans.

Why don't you guys have voice?
I'm working tomorrow
I haven't had a day off in
Isn't that illegal...?
6I "kind of" envy you. I don't have a conventional job anymore.
because the channel isn't set to give auto voice
I'm not full time :P
What's the point of having voice at all if you can speak without it?
7im a idiot.......
otherwise yeah
12no, you are not
because you can set a channel mode that only lets those with voice or above speak
but after tomorrow
Lol, nice.
7and you know it
Another thing I'll have to learn how to do :P
/me sighs
start studying the list of modes
10...
10o-O
10?
you shouldn't ask that in here lol
6I don't like it that much.
I didn't even bother finishing DotD
6I don't HATE it... the genre is just kind of "blah" to me.

No fantards
4Everytime someone tries something different
4they ignore it
2FF.net is kinda... strange. :P
4I think I may venture over to DMC and see how the fantards are there
Why would you even /want/ to try anything different?
4i dunno
2In their defense I don't think there's a lot of material to work with with the Spyro franchise.
4I think my IQ is above 2
2Doesn't really give them an excuse for becoming monotonous though.
4Dracokon: make some shit up
The TLoS story is totally cliche
And the originals weren't really plot-based
Except for YotD I guess
4I did that one
4and I made 2 other siblings forhim and made a story
2And mushy mushy.
4lol
4Hence why I just stick to my own writing
4I basically know every SxC plot
4OH NOZ, CYNDER IS DEPRESSED
2hehehehe
4SPYRO, BEING THE MANLY MAN, COMES OVER AND SAYS HE LOVES HER TO CHEER HER UP
4THEY KISS
4AND THEN SOME RANDOM BULLSHIT HAPPENS
2It was nauseating.
4I used to like SxC
4but that was when Cynder wasn't a brick
2I was never really into SxC.
2Doesn't mean I haven't seen/read it though. :P
4lol
4I did memories and that was a large hit to them
It makes no sense
4and then I did a sequel and said 'fuckit' halfway
Oh yeah, was that where you ended it with that rant about Cynder?
4yeah
2lmao
That was epic
Yes, I said epic
Shoot me
4lol
4So yeah
4I am doing my own shit now
4Stormy
4please put Brick instead of Cynder
4SPYROROCKS
I dunno if I'm supposed to mess with the word filter
Forgot the underscore :P
haha
/me 4sighs
4yeah it is
That used to be the coolest thing ever in the SPAM forum in 06
:P
4lol
Some people needed it a lot *cough*
4CAPTAIN PLANET...HE'S A HERO!
4though now that I think back, not awesome
4hey...
2Gonna take pollution down to zero.
4what happened to Kazoobie?
She left ):
4what happened?
/me sits in a corner and sulks
She didn't approve of how the forum was being run
Or something
4ah
PM? :P
4no
Aww
Fine
4but this place does seem empty
4All of the old, good, members left
Yeah...
4Yeah
4but 90% of them are retards
4lol
4well there is like nothin going on
yeah
And neither of us really care about Spyro anymore
4yeah
I like IRC though
4Though I say Spyro the other day
4saw*
Especially this server
All the other servers I've been on are too crowded
4heh
And I don't know anyone ):
Pretty much the opposite of this place
4aye
4the Spyro fandom is out of hand
4and the older members are loosing interest
yep
4oh?
4ah
2Sounds like me. :P
4LoS got me back into the series
4there should be some maturity in them
That reminds me of this thread on the forum today
4Immaturity?
Someone was saying LoS wasn't immature enough
4yeah I just off of that thread
And everyone took it the wrong way
They were all like
"Talking purple dragons aren't immature!"
As if that was the point of the thread at all... >_>
4lol
2lmao
4shows that 90% of the fans have the IQ of 1
wtf
Meow
Hai :D
He's an old member
I invited him here
You mean this one?
ok
+N is set
nice going
/me hisses
Yeah sorry
:P
I like +N
Of course you do
4eh?
2Land of the Lost YES.
:)
:D
In old Avalar, there is a story after the war was one
4...I want my name as Rurik Astley
Haha
2haha
I don't have +N in my channel... :P
that in the guise of the N'webo, the last of the Principal's was taken down
4y'know, browsing through ff.net....I want to slit my writs
4wrists*
lol
2I haven't been there in YEARS.
I don't usually go there
haven't been in months
2It was pretty bad when I was active there, back in like 2003.
its populated by NTs
2 2001-2003
haha
I don't blame her
4I don't blam eher
Rurik: I wanted to do that when I was on Vicodin
I wrote this song
I'm going to marry spyro
wow
2haha
2no me first :P
Those meds do you in good
Now I'm up to worse things
I can only imagine
4wow
4fuck that
lol
2lmfao

filth
Normal people and their oddities
'Ayin, wayshower
Yaoi?
I"ve been a mod before LOL
@_@
Did he like it?
I don't nkow yet, after all the crap he gave that series, I"d be too hesitant to believe him a convert
although, I don't believe much of anyone to begin with, you should know that about me by now
:D
I wont' be sticking about for long
I actually have things that mean something to me to get done
:D
:)
2Im just watching some TV.
..no one doese, no one doese, it sthe same bullshit every year, unless you're in college that is
2I am. :P
Mandatory grade school/grammar school only needs to teach people the basics
that's all wbe need
2That's why I say "class" not "school", hehe.
We're not in the industrial age anymore
/me doesnt' believe that's a personality issue
it happened to me as well
just in a more extreme fashion
2Well, I dont really want to talk about it... usually doesn't help my case any.
Oh, sorry
2Its ok
Lack of sleep makes you depressed.
2I sleep a lot. Or I try to.
2And I avoid the sun since I burn too easily. :P
ouch
:(
I don't get as much sleep as I should.
I think I Do
2I slept 11 hours last night.
I slept 3 hours, lol.
I had to do it behind the group home and my social workers back
It worked, until the drive died from being hit by lightening
but it worked :)
I take it more as an act of standing up for my right of free expression
2Writing?
2ah
there is more then one way to tell a good faerytale
:)
especially an anti-NT one, where the villians are Teachers
and Head-teachers
2What does NT mean, exactly?
Neurotypical or "Normal"
2ah
Its a term that fellow Autistics created as a retort to being labeled
although, they're totally missing the point, but that's beside the point, Meow
2Kinda like "mundane" to the furry community. :P
Mundane is a label also used at Sci-Fi conventions to denote again, normal people
notes*
/me DLs RPG Maker XP and grins
/me yawns
I agree
2So, I chatted with SR last night :P
2That was interesting :P
chatting with SR is the most interesting thing you can do here
2Yea
2;_;
I think Janus_Zeal is surge168 or something
I forgot his full name
he was banned years ago.
2Also hello

ummmmm
His "NT" phrase thing.
I remember that from when I used to talk to him.

I dont want him around.
yeah I thought he was a little fucked up
He is.
I didn't talk to him lol
2haha he must be fucked up if I can chill out but he cant :P
ban*
Because hes technically still banned
Why would she ever do that./
She knows very well hes banned.
idk
she prolly thought it didn't matter anymore
I always remember bans.
well make sure you tell her that
she prolly didn't think it mattered
hahaha
"Serge_c2000@cloak-72338786.mpls.qwest.net"

Eh, oh well
You guys banned Serge then?
Sorry for letting him in here
yup
He's kind of annoying
Sort of like Doppel
I'm nice to him and he starts considering me like a great friend or something
I don't know how to get rid of people like that without being mean
lol
I know how :P
aw
well I'm nice to someone too
unless I know they're screwed up
then I kinda have to tell the truth
o.o
I feel bad for letting him in now but also that he's going to be sad now that he's banned
Blarg
eh
just tell him it was by order of
SR
Yeah but I don't really even want to talk to him at all
But I can't tell him to go away either because he's always like
You're such a great friend, you're the only one that's ever accepted me, blah blah
yeah yeah
D;
Yeah...
sorry if I'm not much help
He doesn't make any sense half the time either
*noticed
yah
Looking back, I probably shouldn't have said anything about IRC
I was trying to make up an excuse to not talk to him honestly
ot
"it's ok"
you still around?
Yes
Oh OK
dont worry about serge
surge*
I dont want him around here
he was previously banned

Hi
7Stormy, doesn't Yahoo have a habit of getting in with the pedos?
Umm
If you mean Ayumi, then yeah I guess
7Ayumi thrice, Nakuto, and now Aduro.
Aduro? o.o
7yes.
Heh
How old is Aduro then?
6 16 I think
7http://www.mibbit.com/pb/DazDZd she took advantage of the situation well, and now I have proved to Aduro Karma has my back, and that no-one escapes my ever-striking gaze.
7aduro's 18.
7RDX concurs.
Lol
She doesn't like him then
=P
7I'm not sure whether she does or not, it's just her training taught her to take advantage of the situation.
7SILENCE OF DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
6o.o
7AAAAA- oh, it's only Magikal.
9Only?
6Hai =D
7Yeah.
7You're not worth killing.
9Aww
7unless you have the price of a bullet on you.
9Let me check
6lolus
7how much is a bullet by the way?
9No idea
7ah. How much do you have on you?
7Hello, Father of Thyme.
Never have I ever fathered Thyme.
6o.o
Argh.
7I hate him.
7let's kill him.
Welcome back.
6WB
Haven't seen you in a while.
9On Wednesday I am
7AAAH
7IT'S RYFT
7KILL IT
/me dies
9Kja: Why?
7Neon: No. The bitchiness and power abuse is gone, remember?
7we can say homosapien without being banned for a week.
I did sense some sort of fluctuation there.
;)
/me wants ops D:
/me also wants a sammich
o.o
Did she really lose it though?
7she did.
<+Kjakings> we can say homosapien without being banned for a week. o__O
7oh.
7I dunno.
9 888chan?
/me perches on ChanServ
XD
lolwut
7she now denies it of course.
9...XD
I can sort of see her doing that though
I remember that fondly.
I was there, dude.
:P
7oh.
7lol.
She was here for a visit like a week ago
I honesly didn't know she officially left.
7Remember when she flipped out because she thought we were talking to her.
9'Human' CAN be insulting, with some examples there are
7Neon: she didn't. She fled with her tail between her legs.
9That's stylish.
/me only had a month of summer. Sad face.
I talk to her on gmail sometimes
7I had nine weeks. *wins forever*
9Neon: Why?
9Oh.
7Stormy: I swear we had this conversation. You said that /exact_thing/
9My summer dragged on
7I slept through most of my summer.
yeah
My summer slept through most of me.
I think only you were there though
9Neon: Math?
:P
I dunno
Yeah.
4lol?
But I learned at my high school that the Algebra one I did last year was their equivalent of Algebra II, haha.
No, I'm saying I failed miserably.
9Again, 88chan?
XD
9Lol.
7Neon: the point stands
4Neon, it isn't surprising
I never passed the damn thing.
7Magikal: a chan, which tehtodnfofu was a member of and organised a raid against here.
Magikal: 888chan is a group of stupid people (who are actually brilliant according to kjakings) that attacked the forum and IRC
7No.
9Oh.
7I never said they were brilliant.
7I said they had inspirtational moments.
4lies
7Their tactics have been acumulated through the vast majority of semi-intelligent channers.
:/
9Sucks.
Yeah.
Of how the point stands.
=/
Are you in eigth?
Not necessarily
I'm a sophomore.
9Yeah, going into
/me is a Senior~
I'm not sure, it was okay for me. Not too hard.
Ryft: Kewl.
Calculus is awesome :3
/me 9feels young

9I saw.
The one I wrote a minute ago?
9Yeah.
:/ She's gonna hate me for this.
9If she has any ounce of maturity, then no.
I don't mean to offend, but she's gotten pissed over less convicting things.
I guess.
9Like?
9Oh...well that's about right.
If necessary I'll add it, if she ever even replies.
And the only reason I'd be sad about that is because I won't be able to read her retort.
9She already thinks that she's alone
9And multiple browsers?
Speaking of which, do the people on OFF know she's a girl yet? Haha.
No, because she hid all the forums except for like the Intro one to non-users.
9Oh yeah.
I sort of always knew it'd boil down to this, two on one.
But then everyone's had the same position she's in now.
Me summer of '08, you Fall of '08, and now her.
9Late bloomer.
Well said.
I'm not on MM, anything happen?
I'll assume no.

7Oh em gee.
7why should I care?
I dunno, you said she was scared to come on.
7Frequently.
7besides, YOU said it originally.
Me?
7yes.
When?
7a day or two ago. You continued with "I've seen their 'life ruination tactics'. Fail."
I was just commenting on that section of their site.
7Someone did, and my money's still on you.
Also, they don't have Aicebo's details.
Pff, how? They don't know her first or last name.
The most I ever said was that she was scared of them, not that they made her too scared to come on here.
She repeatedly said herself that she was "scared".
7meh
7ah.
7then why the fuck are you pissing all over me? I don't care beyond that she doesn't come on here much.
I'm just telling you.
7Heh. I could say the same.
How have I been angry since I've joined here?
Wth do you mean?
I was just explaining something to him.
:P
2:3

Lol.
2Lol, practically all the boys at my primary school used to pretend they were being Pokémon xD
I would think they steal more for the rush of it than the actual loot.
2XD
Why is it that some cuts weep, and others don't. O_o
7dari: some are more sensitive than others.
2Its to do with how the cut was made, I think o.o
Or where, rather.
Ough

Woot, spine infection.

6Hey =D
6k
7"Here we are now, eating tables. Help the stupid, they're contagious."
6lol maybe
7"Here we are now, in the 'tato."
7"I'm a lighter."
7"and albino!"
7"I'm a skittle, I'm a ditto."
6http://twitpic.com/h0c77 ...
hoc, lol. Latin.
7"I was in blood, I confessed."
6Oh ya,that's why I opened a tab
7"I met a girl, whose sauce smelled."
/me 6opens it again
7(lots of hellos)
2See heer?
7and repeat.
/me 2facepalms
6*confuzz*
7*points up*
6Oh
6It creeped me out when I first heard it..
7"And I forget, just why I taste."
7"I vomit hard, it's hard to vomit."
From Nirvana?
7some song.
6Lol
"Smells Like Teen Spirit"
2Dari: Nirvana song. See above.
Hey.
7I like the 'tato thing.
It is, but it was once a hit/
7"I'm a nightgown."
6lol
6o.o
6OH FOR FUCKS SAKE
2... Whats up C7?
She just likes swearing.
It's evident.
6Nah
Oh for fuck's sake = Oh for the sake of fuck ...It doesn't really make sense.
Especially since it isn't a noun.
7she refuses to ellaborate because I labelled her the official complainer.
6I never refused
7Ever.
You say no one, which doesn't really make sense, I have friends.
6Still,I'm just sick of that game..-.-
2JEEZ
6o.o
I hate that abbreviation.
7Pendantics, Stacey.
6I bet now she'll get pissed off or something
2Yeah, but I do NOT like pediatricians fyi.
7Dari: Again, pedanticness.
2:P
Lol.
Respondin gto someone is not pedantic.
6Aww..she cancelled it : D
Get yourself a dictionary. :)
6brbus
^Lameus
7Dari: No, of course not. But being a pedantic douche IN that response IS being a pedantic.
2Wow.
Which response?
2Everyone on the be right back bus!
2:3
7"You say no one, which doesn't really make sense, I have friends."
6Lol
I still maintain that you should look up pedantic, proving that people do like me is not being pedantic.
/me 2cries
6D:
7Yes, but pointing out the flaws of a commonly accepted term IS being pedantic.
6HE WROTE
I was pointing out that I had friends/
Murder, she wrote.
2...
6o.o
6Whatebur
7Dari: Yes. But you were still being pedantic. Make me repeat myself some more, please, I enjoy it.
7Not constantly bitches. I do occaisionally try and have a conversation normally.
You ALWAYS have something to complain about.
The first thing you do when you come on is start moaning at someone.
^ Quoes
*quotes
2....that was a fail actually, you're both online right NOW.
Now who's being pedantic, and disputing a commonly used phrase.
7Stacey: Note that I said 'when I come on'.
7Yes, but at least I'll admit it BEFORE I can suddenly use it against you.
2Wow, you sure like ignoring half of my comments.
Besides in books.
7what word?
Pedantic.
2HURRHURR
7Ah.
7It's still a word.
Anyway, I remember you used to like loop-holes, to find a loop-hole usually means nit-picking, which is pedantic.
Didn't say it wasn't.
2I was gonna ask that but then I thought Kja would say 'before' or something and tell me I'm stupid and I should go live in a dustbin etc.
/me 6watches the little bit they show of her school on TV with the politician dude
Oh wait, it is. ;)
7Nah, Dustbins smell bad. Skips the smell is more spread out and mingled.
6lol
7Dari: Oh. Total n00b-skills you have there. Completely ignoring my point by just enough that you don't answer it properly but go on about a different subject that's related.
You clearly have not grown up, or you wouldn't start an argument for a stupid reason.
2It now says 'TOILET FILM' and 'CLING ROLLS' O.O
Hey, I read that book.
6o.o
*improvises
7When exactly did you step down?
2You're both being immature by arguing about this actually o.o
I said like I'm doing, in other words that post was me stepping down.
7Fair enough.
Wanna trip like I do, behbeh?
7I'll give you a trip.
6o.o

Hello.
Hi
Yes

/me is listening to music while simultaneously writing. We'll see how that works.
4Funk
0.o
I just got off of Skype
:P
o.O
I don't get it
4no it is my friend
4but he used my rant and said it was hers
Oh
4No, he used mine to reply to hers. He knew which one was hers and mine
7Good afternoon.
7;o
7*sees him go bye bye*
Hi iSO
7Tis nice to see you talking nao. XD
Why can't you PM now?
7No... :<
7In the chatroom.
Are you using the main site?
Spyrochat.com?
7Yes.
Lol, the messages should open in another tab
I don't think PM's work if you go through the SpyroChat link
7Hmmm. :<
I think he has to get a standalone client
or connect through the main Mibbit site
Or mibbit.com
Yeah
www.mibbit.com/chat/
7Chatroom name and server?
#spyrochat
7I actually know Mibbit, I just need those two.
irc.epic-chat.net
#spyrochat
7Sounds custom. :o
well it was created by someone lol
what's custom?
I'm guessing the network :P
7NM,
Oh :P
7It's listed in the website.
7The list of all the servers. X3
7*will be testing*
Yeah it's good.
Why does the other one wouldn't work with PM and maybe other functions?!
because the other one is just a basic connection
you're not using the full capabilities that Mibbit has to offer
Did modes ever work on Spyrochat.com?
No
But I could
=/
In order to access such functions you have to have a standalone client
7Hm.
Yeah, the password shows up in the URL
7Anyways, it's a quiet day yes?
o.o
Yeah
It's pretty quiet here most of the time
7And that, yeah. That one bugs me in consideration of privacy.
that's why you should get a standalone client
Mibbit sucks
yah it does
end of story
Spyware FTW
Thank you and good night
7*shoots RedDraggieX-ie*
:P
/me goes back to blowing shit up
lol
why would you shoot me?

like I said if you want it to be more active encourage other members to come here
I'm linking to the epic-chat.net website in my signature on some sites
Probably won't help much, but...
I've already got it in like five sites
7;o
hm
Well
This
:P
and games
and coding
and school
7Coding? Programming?
7:P
Yup
Most of us IRC freaks do something involving computers :P
yep
7Heh.
I'm learning Java in school
Computer Networking for me
And I do some HTML coding on the side for my own amusement
7I particularly draw. :3
7Care for a juicy example? XD
7Just say yes.
7...:;o
Um, yes
:P
7http://www.mariowiki.com/images/b/bd/Page0-5Final.png
7It's 4.5MB!
7I had to compress it with PNG Monster! :3
7Originally 5Mb, tis 4.5Mb nao!
not bad
7Look closer, you can see things connected.
wow
I draw, but not well :P
7Just thank me that I removed 500KBs of uncompressed rots.
are you any good at drawing Spyro?
7I mentioned something of me haven't drawn Spyro, I forgot him after I was forced to do more schoolwork because of failing grades.
7:<
7Do you know what's the weird thing about Spyro drawings?
7The lack of good buildings that came from the old Spyro series.
7The drawings.
7I'll give you an example that has the feeling of them. :3

Enchanted Towers
Best level ever
:P
7God!
7*want
A Hero's Tail?
7Sorry,
7Indeed.
I was just talking to one of my old friend from this forum about the old games
:P
7I'm pretty glad that Spyro 3 is a mix of 1 and 2. :D
7o_O
7Are you using dial-up?!
Lolno
7Netzero?
No
7No FiOZ?
7Verzion fiber.
7;|
7Then I can't tell. D:
7I should really draw Spyro one day.
My college campus probably just has a bad connection
7But I have to draw someone else... first. ;)
And the fact that I'm on this tiny laptop might have something to do with it
O.o
Why?
7;o
Downloading off Limewire
I forgot to turn the uploads off ><
7XD
7Ahhh...
oh well
7I don't really do that kind... *shifty*
I'm 18
RDX is 20

Thanks a lot.
Bye
7You're welcome.
12backus.
its definitely quiet in here right now
it's 8 at night
past the usual hours of being active
12Alright, I..I can't say it on here.
12PM me if you're interseted x.o
Hm.. yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not "interseted". >:)
12*interested
12:\
12kinky?
12o.O
12;-;
12gtg mann
nice
I'll email them to you
he wants to see them
OK
Probably a good idea to send them to me before applying them ;)
You have to apply them anyway
we don't have the capabilities
yeah
we're a little smarter then that ;)
why
Its awesome.
little description if you can
aspire one could run it no problem.
Pretend vista didn't exist
when did you try it out?
I installed it on most of my home pcs.
hmm
I'll have to look into it
Ive been running it for a week.
if it's based on XP that would be great
easier for my Networking classes
Its basically a rewrite of vista.
I meant in terms of my entire networkings course is based off XP
not Vista
Oh
it does it all for you.
Damn
OK
Depends, but if you have a problem you have to get into the circuits and figure it out
It reconized everything automatically on my network
installed drivers
done
I'm not talking about recognition
I just mean in terms of basic mechanics
if something goes wrong you know how to fix it
about 25% smaller
hardware recognition has developed greatly ever since basic XP came out
Not much goes wrong at my home when it comes to the network
Probably different in a business setting
Id use it if I had a business that needed an upgrade.
if you can't network at home you're an idiot lol
You can network anywhere, it does everything for you.
people don't usually need to mess with hardware.
I know
if you screw it up you're a moron
yep
lol
we haven't gotten into it yet
I'll ask him on Monday
even more simple if everything is wireless.
yeah but not all business use wireless
they should
yeah they should
but they don't
well I forgot to ask him that the other day
I'm sure their is some kind of reason
yeah ask him
if theres any reason not to use wifi instead of wired.
and not have to run cable.
it also makes it easy to add wifi printers
and NAS
there is
Half the time I'm fucking around on the computer
wifi is quite cheap
espexially for business use
you can buy in bulk
yeah I'll be sure to ask him
we still have to come up with names for the ranks
And ranges
I had it on a 15 scale before

10Hey :>
12you need tribal ink
12D:
14Why? XD
14My collection is unique :P
12so many people don't know about tribal ink
14ewww limewire
/me RUNS
12lol
12tribal ink gained fame because one of their songs somehow got listed as "what i've done" on limewire
14looooooool
14limewire makes me laugh
12indeed
10o_O
12lol
10Limewire, eww
12wow
14I was on the floor laughing at that
12to my face is actually decent

12Tribal Ink - To My Face
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t20iA4dFs2Y
14That's interesting
14So the mystery band has been found in my collection
12lol
14One of the albums that came with an MP3 disc of linkin parks albums collection
14Came with THAT song
12LOL
14plus a few others
12i told you
12linkin park songs got mixed up with their songs
14Just could never figure out how it was
12you're not the first person to fall victim to that
14He is convinced the "album" IS linkin park XD
12it's still ironic that that was how they gained fame
14Indeed it is
12because of limewire and their songs being labled wrongly lol
12almost makes you think they did it themselves
14Know the album name Glacy?
12hold on i have it
12Surrounded By Freaks

the scientologist?
07I like Eminem's quote for that one.
that's like being a mormon, but even worse
03Will Smith isn't scientologist, his wife is
and dunno about it just being his wife
03and as far as Eminem... I mean, he does really good songs like Mockingbird and of course he can't go an entire song without swearing >_>

12drivers
03They should
12i have no doubt they would
03my 7 CAME with drivers
04:o
03but if you use NVIDIA, just go to their site and they have them
12it's just that last time i reinstalled vista onto this laptop
04well i have those
04nvidia here
03but it automatically had the sound c1ard, the Wi-Fi card, the LAN thingy
03it had all the drivers I'd need
03Kyu, you can't upgrade directly from XP to 7, no
03you have to do a clean install
07ah
04i would do a clean install but idk
12yeah
03Clean installs are the way to go
04too lazy
04i have everything on another partition but eh
12i think i want a key
12i'll risk it
03it won't let you
04i have ultimate :D
03hm

04more like not-so-ultimate amirite
03I know Business upgrades to Professional
03yeah
03Ultimate would upgrade to Ultimate but I can't get 7 Ultimate
07lol
12i'll just do a clean install
12lol
12then install wubi again
037 Ultimate only has added languages and some secure booting thing
03it's completely not worth it
12yes
03I heard that sucks
12it wouldn't let me partition the system
04i have ubuntu installed as well atm

2are you a reg or anything?
2LOL yeah

2Hey Arti!!
6and I like g00n, but her ways are rediculously tr00by

6Arti it was
6hence me "same person"
04If I ever mention that she is gonna kill me (exsaggeration)
6I wont because it's not necessary
6same
04It's just, she doesn't seem as friendly anymore
6I used to be decent friends with her
2she's plenty friendly to me
04And I was really out down when she remarked my RP was "WH LOLOL"
6I can't tell you how many lines I've seen that are g00n's trademarks, and she uses them a thousand times over
04put*
2I just have a hard time getting her to straighten up P|

04She needs to lrn2internet
6what rp?
04?
2bad news: most of it is crude, and usually from NS or Xeli
6I take it the comment was removed?
6I learn it from g00n
04she said it to me
6oh
04still...
2O_o''
12Check that mod/admin topic please
2Heya

Pff. Screw parents.
12When I told Xai that he went through the roof. I mean it's not like we'd ever win the lottery but it's the fact that if we ever had a large sum of money, they'd expect us to use it on them!

06Or a drawing of Raikou or something. 8D
Haha, good luck with the PB XD
06RORA.
AKA not happening.
/me pokes Rora
06>v>
6why am I poked?
6oo
06Do you even play Neopets, Rynn?
12hai Roara~
06Kyu is kinda rich. :\
/me coughs
6o-o?
6oh neopets
6XD
I used to play, not anymore.
06At least try? D=
I just know the Faerie PB is like ridiculously hard to find.
06If you don't you have to draw Raikou for me. 8D
/me is shot
06Rynn, you don't have to FIND it.
06You have to BUY it.
06The only two ways I can think of to get it otherwise are random events or Keyquest (Gold Key, of course).
06>v>
07hah
07checkmate
06Doesn't need to be an auction.
06It's called a trade.
06And Faerie PB trades are NOT hard to find.
06I would buy it myself, but I only have around 600,000 NP.
06Rounded down, of course.
06=3
06But still.
>.>
...Ever hear of a bank?
06=v=
06That's where the NP is AT.
XD?
Just go and be one of those straw hat millionaires.
06What? >v>
06You need an initial deposit.
06Or whatever.
06You need that much NP or more for it. >v>
06Besides, the interest is only about 176 anyway.
/me checks
06No, 175.
07oh wow
07my plushie brush doubled in price since I checked last
07o3o
Neopets was just... like, not good.
06If you hate it that much, than don't talk about it or something, lawl.
o
06Wait, I has NP on me.
06Only 876, though.
06Blaah, I have no choice.
/me puts her extra Striped PB up for auction TvT
06I could always buy another one when the time comes anyway.
06Lawl.
06That should do it.
07why do you even need one if you're not using it lol
06For if something ever happened to my Xweetok.
06Like, if she was hit by a random event turning her into a different type.
06My Bori was turned Baby once.
06UMBREE.
06I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
06http://pimpanime.com/internet/naruto-shippuden.html << ENGLISH.
06=D
12forget english
06There are only four episodes on it, though.
06Where are they getting them from? D=
06I've been checking the adult swim schedule for if they ever plan to air Naruto Shippuden on Satuday nights but don't have commercials for it yet or something.
06*Saturday
07Naruto isn't Adult Swim lol
06I know.
06But it's anime, and actionish.
06=D
/me misses Toonami TvT
12night everyone~
/me pokes Quan
10Night
06=3~

07Cynder
06...
06DISNEY?
06WHAT?
07disney xd
06D=
06That SUCKS!
/me slaps herself
06Mood swings.
06D=
07what difference does the channel make if you like the show?
06In every way.
06Except sarcasm.
07so?
06So it's not worth it.
06Unless Hidan appears soon.
068D
06Then again, I COULD just watch records of the English episodes online when the time comes.
06So..
07....
06It's NOT worth watching the channel.
06D=
07well that's just dumb
06No.
06That's just awesome.
07hardly
06I can skip the lame, non-Akatsuki-related scenes~
06=D
06And commercials, if they don't cut 'em out.
07it's still dumb to not watch something just because of the channel that it's on
06So?
7Nyaaaaaa~n
06X3
6LATIWOLF?
07so why not watch it if there is no logical reason
/me 6runs
7o3o
/me 7declines politely
6pm
/me declines impolitely inb4 invite
6comin ur way
/me is shot
07'i don't like disney' isn't a logical reason if Naruto isn't owned or created by it
07in fact
06...
06Uhm...
/me is brick'd
06*=D
7I tried it algebraically, and got -45. O_o
06I wanna sprite something, but whut? X3
10Gtg, cya
6me
7Heeeeeeey, Rora. X3
06..
7Y'want me to put my sprite of you up on dA?
7But then it becomes 360 - 2x = 450, or -2x = 90
7So I get -45 degrees as an answer. :/
/me 6got some paints today <3
7I don't get it. D:
07that's not right
072(180-x) = 5(x) + (90-x)
07well this way comes out non-negative
07besides
07multiplication first
07duuuuh
7X3
07in any case
07it's still 45
07XD
7Lulz.
07not really lol
07your way only technically worked because the answer was 45 lol
7BTW, I signed up for a cosplay club at my school. o_O

06Once I catch him, he'll become my replacement starter. XD

She actually took to it quite naturally. oo

That was... odd. oo

10i can make it 50x50 if that's the problem
04It's 40x40

07How can I work with MPEG-4 files?
07Windows Movie Maker refuses it :>
07But I want to edit them :>
07As in compile every little clip I have into a movie, but they're MPEG-4 XD
http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html
download this and run it
that way you can convert the movie into ANY format you wish
I'd use avisynth, but it's fiddley.
Lots of setup
I don't know any basic ways to do it. Only avisynth.
12Damn I havent played DDR in ages
AGH.
I overwrite my Vista boot sector... intending to just put it back again.
Have fun
12You fail
But no... HP's 'repair' utilitity is triggered.
And it just disabled Vista, and insists that my laptop now needs to be reformatted.
07TimeShift
07Probably me being lame now but I can't find the download link XD;

Apple products are overpriced, they also tend to be pretty difunctional and stay that way until ASpple's literally sued for it. Then they fix the problems only to cause more. Rinse, repeat
And yes, that would work, as long as it worked XD

It always felt like baby's first computer.
2Never used a mac before :o
2but heard of it :P
03They're pretty good but you have to know how to use them.
2great idea
2but that would require a seperate partition
No thanks XD
03Indeed, but it's not hard to make a separate partition with boot camp.

04Honey bees may be extinct by 2035 T_T

07wild, or all?
04Someone said that mancind is trying to get more out of the bees thsn they can offer.
04ll of them.
04It's called Colony Collapse Disorder.
6heard of that too
6???
04To see the bees as they die.
04Which might help find a cause.
6well, note that X-Ray is radiation
04...Crud.
6hence having lead-base mats to protect you
04Night-vision camera?
6...
04:S
04I mean hive.
07tons of bees die from things not associated with the disease though
CCD is a mystery. Disection turns up digestive failures.
04Glass hive? T_T
But no apparent cause for it.

07Vyl?

6I know it's kinda weird, but I just watched the last episode of Guiding Light with my grandma
6she said it's been aired for 71 years lol
6anyhoo
07food
07FOOD
6I want some
07you'll get nothing, and like it!
/me runs
6:|
/me 6goes for her own food
07gUYS
07LIKE LEGALLY?
07JUST CURIOUS
/me sighs...
10o_O
I'll bbl
10Depends on the reasons
07i didnt realise i allcaps'd
10If you have a reason i guess it's fine
07Well
10To a certain extent of course :P
07Xeli do you know the shadowcat on deviantart?
6lol
07or toyger? a cat person lol
10what
07she addex 'zuno' to her real name because she thought 'silje' was too ordinary
10No, i thought of the norwegian kid trying to change name to "Sonic X"
6If someone had a name prone to humiliation as some parents do to their kids, then fine
07a friend of a friend
10true story, and ovo
07LOL
07what happened to them?
07LOL
07Aurora, why don't you?
10He got rejected for underage + copyright infringement
07Loool
07why on earth..
10idk
07But yeeah
10attention!
10that's why
07Actually for years, I've contemplated changing my name
10i guess it was a cute story, and oh?
07Not removing ym first name, but adding to it
6adding to it is fine
07Maria Dolores is my birthname
6I don't support a full change
10The most regular ones are adding and changing surname when getting married and such though.
07Yus
07What do you guys think of my suggestions though?
Aparently one of our teachers changed their 1st name noel to leon(which we knew him as), but I doubt it cause he didn''t do anything about his middle name valentine
10lol
10mhm
6and with my explanation, if the reason for the change falls between the parenteses, by all means
07when I came here, I was supposed to be named only Kathrine
07so LOL
6hmm
10that sort of changed the situation tbh
07Yar
07well, I dont know about adding Dolores, would like opinions
6lol, if I changed my middle name to be "Aurora", no one would be able to tell based on initials XD
07Arrow is strongly against me adding Dolores to my name because he associates the word with its meaning
10o.o
hawkeh
goon
llawts
'ello
07Lol
07something like that
07asdf
6Dolores is pain and sorrows
10yeshai
rawra
6Means "sorrows", taken from the Spanish title of the Virgin Mary María de los Dolores, meaning "Mary of Sorrows".
07Ah yes
07that
07Mary of Sorrows..
07what a name to give me, mum
07lol..
/me pokes it

When FL said that I'd be banned for being Lurkerman, I thought I'd play with him
6lolwut
But no hard feelings
I was planning on revealing it soon anyway
Lurkerman is Lurkerman
03I thought you could type whatever name you want
04ok awesome

I was merely helping out with keeping the peace in there

03I hate PHProxy though
Because she doesn't want it to be spammage.
03oh well :/
I was just saying you'd get demoted for telling me off to intimidate him.
He fell for it
6...
6well, I still stand by what's been said :/
6that place is already a timebomb
As I have said, I'm done in there.
07well technically the cbox wouldn't go away if he doesn't pay for it

/me 14flicks his tail onto Hail's and wraps his wing around her.
/me 12wraps her tail around Vulcans, and stops licking him, then lays on his neck.
/me 12stands up, a playful look on her face.
14-.=.o
/me 14gets up and follows quietly.

/me 14lays down and curls up, looking up at the Clear Night Sky.
/me 12puts her wing on Vulcan, and lays down on his back.
12*lays down her head.
12*lays down her head on his back.
14o.=.o
12(O.O)
12(Lol Dari you have a DS?)
/me 14jumps a bit from not noticing her but quickly recovers and wraps his wing around her.
Yes.

/me 14yawns and cuddles around Hail, murring lowly.
12Idunno.
I said I have a DS Lite. O_o
Not DSi
/me 12shuts her eyes again, and finally drifts off to sleep.
Don't forget to wear protection.*wink*
By which I mean a helmet, of course.
/me 14knocks against his Faceplate.
14I'm armored from Head to tailtip.
14Except my back.
14and limbs
Et amicus puelam amobat.
12what language?:
Latin
puellam amabat*
Vulcan: I think you missed the point if my joke.
Maybe you're too young to get it.
14i'm 17
Welcome to the club
14x3
/me needs to be 18 like, now
Ryft, you learn Latin?
I wish
I wanted to
12Et amicus puellam amabat latin
I know a few words, here and there
12Dang, you. "
12o_o
Yeah
It is, and I know that phrase
Which is why I asked.
12Anyone know polskich tutaj?
/me 14yawns once more.
14nope.
12Hmmm. Zastanawiam się, dlaczego mają inną liczbę liter na każde słowo w każdym języku. o_O
/me 12snuggles up to Vulcan.
/me 12stretches her wings, tail, and limbs.
/me 12flares her nostrils and makes sure she isn't sick.
/me 12smiles.
Wow, which planet do you live on for it to rotate on its axis in 30 minutes?
/me 14blink and looks around with a Yawn.
/me 12blows ice shards, and sculpts a pillow, and a blanket.
Lol.
/me 12breaks the pillow.
12"Meh"
/me 12drags the blanket over to a different spot and lays under it.
/me 14gets up and stretches out; opening his wings and curling his tail back.
12Hail is used to these things, she loves the cold.
14Figured as much. she's an ice dragonness.
12Yea.
12XD
12she is oddly always warm though
14Really?
12when people touch her she is toasty.
12 but she really is cold
/me 14places a paw on her lightly.
Oddly enough
I'm cold to the touch
but am usually warm :\
12She feels the cold on the inside.
12But hses used to it.
The opposite of a Tauntaun :D
12When other peoiple touch her, she is warm on there paws.
12*people
12*their
12Oh my gosh No.

/me 12makes a shocked face.
12YOU ARE ...
12THAT...
Curse you furries, corrupted my mind
Oh wai
t*
I am one
:3
12"touch her"
/me 14rolls over onto his back and stretches his legs upwards before rerolling onto his paws and hopping into the air, flapping his wings and hovering.
I think that was the intention Hail, lol.
/me tries to flap wings but doesn't have any, falls over on his back, tail and ears twitching x.x
/me 12skids to a halt.
/me 12grabs ryft.
/me flails and clings
yawns
/me 12puts him on my back, and flys towards the colorful dots in the large field where horses and cows roam.
Oh mai gawd, my leg is twitching o_o
I know, Vulcan, aluminium? Because you have to be light enough to fly.
/me clings tighter
14Titanium.
14x3
12*around
o.O
14nor too thick or too thin. It's thick enough to be battle armor, but still gives him the ability to fly,
/me has a thing about wolves <.<
/me is a collie/fox hybrid o_o
Always have been part fox <.<
32425 degrees kelvin

/me 12smiles.
/me 12takes it out of the ground
/me 14swoops down towards the field before colapsing his wings in and skidding across the grassy area.
People eating tasty animals

I hate you all
12O.o

/me 12gets close to Vulcan, and licks the side of his neck.
It reaches to Cuba and back XD

/me runsawayrealfast

/me 14murrs lightly and gives a lick back, wrapping a wing around her.

/me 4wakes up
04lol
/me 4looks around
12hai Quan~ (LATE)
04lol
Why?
12Two of my databases have been corrupted or something
12By the host
12Including the backups they keep
o.o
03LOL
04O_o
03See, a cheap host woulda done the same thing, only for less money :P
12o.o
12and my site would never run either
04That's just great
12But anyway
04[sarcasm]
12I'm royally pea-ed off about this
03LOL
04I can see why
03and I'll look around
12*contacts them*
12DRF, you should have done this when I asked
03when did you ask?
12The past two years before last?
12Before I finally got a recommendation from someone else
12I do
12TST is fine
12and my gallery, which I have a backup of.. somewhere -v-
12But that isn't the point
12Point is they lost all my knowledgebase data
12and gallery data
12and it could have been TST that was lost
12ummm...yes, 02 <late>
04lol
12and O.O @Arti
12...
12get used to it :\
04lol
12brb
12I DONT
12Ffs
12Don't you get it?
12I havent found ANYTHING ELSE
12and YOU didnt recommend anything when I asked around for two entire years
12And then you go on about me choosing an expensive host
/me just backs away
/me is hug-burnt a little
12You'd have no experience, you'd only have what's recommended by others like I had
/me pokes Veli to another channel
12I'd rather pay more for a crap host than use one that can't even connect to the databse
12back~
wb
12Ok, host just got back to me really fast
12"Hi
12Were restoring all databases shortly.
12If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to ask by replying to this email.
04Max, #Oblivion
12What a relief
12thankies~ <late>
/me yawns
haitair~
03what sort of databases do you use... MySQL or?
07they're not bears on unicycles! get them!
07XP
04urk brb
12Yes MySQL
12SQL is old and sucks
12o.o
12XD
03LOL
03well I didn't know which one you used
03LOL $1.95 for MySQL hosting
03I think that's ONLY the database, though, and not actual websites
03you know that one I said was $4 a month, and you said it couldn't possibly be any good?
03It's highest rated on these sites
lol
03the ones that list hosts by user ratings
03so :P
03http://www.hostmonster.com/
12hai J~
12<late> o.o
and that it means something vulgar :D
03LOL
J!!! :D
03like the song Gasolina?
LOL
12Right, how can I trust this host?
exactly
03how can you trust ANY host?
it's gasoline... right?!?!
/me shot
alteh
03It's got 5-star ratings on several sites I looked at
like meh hawk?
03as I was also looking for cheap hosting
shara
that is epic win
03*company
Reeeeeeally?
12HA
i wouldn't say it otherwise LOL
12I wont use them thern!
seriously though
03why
12Already used Bluehost!
mohawks are epin
03just because they have two names?
03what
12They're the same as Powweb!
Thanku :3
12The database connectivity SUCKS
12It doesnt load
12Ever
03BlueHost and PowWeb are the same company?
12No
03well I don't get this whole database connectivity thing
12I mean they're the same as in they both have the same problem
03the database is external, right?
np XD
03and then the site connects to it?
12Yes
12Well sort of
03get a separate MySQL host
03like this one for $2 a month
12That doesnt work
03then get a seperate WEB host
03... why not?
12Takes just as long if you connect outside the host
12Tried that too
03hm
/me runs
12Because I've been reading them for years and they're all the same
03LMAO "Price $1.99, regularly $9.99 a month"
03that's a HUGE discount
12Anyway if any company is connected to Bluehost, I won't touch them
03http://www.siteground.com/mysql-hosting.htm <-- actually
03these guys DO have webhosting
03I'll see if there are reviews of them
12*looks*
03I mean, any company call call themself "the best MySQL hosting"
03but LOL
12Give me about 10 mins to read through this site
03OK
03well I'll look up reviews
03hm
03there seem to be more bad reviews than good ones as far as databases go :/
03but that's because people are stupid
12Cyberhost pro does
03and that's why I generally don't trust reviews
12Nah I've read through pages and pages of them
0330-day money back guarantees FTW?
12Especially Powweb reviews lol
03yeah but I mean you get all these idiots going "It didn't work!!! 1 out of 5"
03that's NOT a good idea of a product or company
03LOL
03Well I think all webhosts do that, even the first YEAR
12Thats why we went with them, thought they were great! Then they turned into Powweb
12Well I can safely say that I've only had this one issue with Cyberhost Pro
03PowWeb, now IT's going really slowly
07http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4106.msg163885#msg163885 << LOL how off topic
LOL
12LMAO
LOOOL
03that and cost more, since they all have "introductory" rates for the first year only
wow

03heh
12lol Alt
03Yahoo is one of the top ranked ones
03for databases
12LOL
/me flees
12*mostly
12DRF
03what
12me and Xai spend 400 on food a month LOL
12Just us two
03http://www.hosting-review.com/hosting-directory/editors_review/yahoo
03o.o why are you telling me that?
04:/
03XD
03anyway: http://www.hosting-review.com/hosting-directory/top-10-lists/Top-10-MySQL-Hosting-Companies.shtml
12lol Arti
04o-o
12o.o
03that site has "professional" reviews of each host, I don't know how accurate they are
12Host gator are up there?
12Thats utter crap
12rawr, Alt?
12I tried them for one month
/me hides
03Number 8
12as a trial
03well see
12and they continued to bill me!!
03LOL
12Even after I requested they stop!
03that's how a trial works
03Oh
12AND they sucked!
03well then no
03but they'll always bill you unless you tell them in time
12Well I think the main problem with my host is how much I have to pay really..
12Because most of the time it's fine
03Heck
12No
03It's like a 1.5 megabit pipe
03no wait
031.5TB disk
03100mbps upload
031gbps download I think
03and I believe it's about $125 a month.
03Even that goes down
03like once a month
12I know
03so my point is: you can have the most deluxe account in the world, and it'll still suck as much as a $2 one
12Yes
/me runs
12But actually
03until now.
03give it a few more months, it;'ll start crashing more and more
03I've seen it before
12We'll see
03LOL
03PowWeb was one of the highest rated ones too
03why?
12Because it doesn't work!
03it's just another name, people have to try it first
12It just flat out does not work
03but there are lots of GOOD reviews too!
12Good reviews from NON database users
03it's like me complaining about PowWeb because I have 20 DVDISOs on it and their servers are struggling to support it
03it's overloading the fricking system
12Ahaha
03http://www.hosting-review.com/hosting-directory/editors_review/fatcow <-- wow, look at this
03this host has a 94%
03all the rest are in the 802
03*80s
12I'll check the site
12Ahh finally a full feature list thats easy to find.. >v>
03I'm totally gonna go eat soon
03they close in half an hour >_> unless I want to walk to another dorm
03but meh, everyone has their stupid introductory prices
03PowWeb does that, even
03is it?
03$7 a month or whatever seems average
12Thats how much Powweb cost
12LOL
03I know
12and they suck
03which is why I'm not gonna renew it
/me hides
03because I'm cheap
03and for me $50 a year is the limit
03I mean, I *could* spen2d more, I'm just not bothered

/me elsquish
Extracted?
*in
.rar is a compressed file
How do I extract it?

No my mistake

You'll need a program like 7zip, WinZip or WinRar to extract it
I recomment 7zip
NO I'M NOT HOAGIE
I'll get you a link
/me glares at El_Sharacabra >_>
o.o;
