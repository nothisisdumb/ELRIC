Flipped an actual coin for it.
Yes, I flipped a real coin.
AFAIK, the first Bayformers movie was somewhat well received. The sequels were disasters.
Oh I thought you wanted me to flip a coin for it.
At least that Transformers movie went to FIM
Nah, I had the coin.
Ugh, my left shoulder is sunburned from yesterday, and it's starting to hurt again.
Heads, I told you. :P

11,01Survey 3, I gouged my eyes out. Unable to work.
13hub this is survey 6, would rather let the others do it, over

Survey 10, WHAT'S GOIN' ON IN THIS THREAD?
13good movie but i hate the camera work
00,10this is survey 12: my computer stoped working I cant seem to get it back on.

You know they tried to do that, but ironically the Run Lola Run folks wouldn't let them.
*spelled
Shaky cam GO!
Goddamn shaky cams
Mayan volleyball: the most hardcore sport since martial arts.
13survey 6, WOMBO COMBO, over
Shaky cam: because the audience doesn't NEED to clearly see what's going on.
survey 6, can u get me an extra order of fries?
survey 42, there's something wrong with the camera - it's all shaky, over
Shaky Cam, because the cameraman needs his exercise too
You know they cut off the losing teams heads and then had a round with them?
omg that movie
when are we streaming it? :p
13oh crap he's being tailed by eomer!
*Most hardcore sport in the history of ever
11,01Shakey cam was on purpose there.
that's up to debate

00,10at least with seats moveing I might not have goten ill
HOLD THE DAMN THING STILL. I don't need to see you shake it around inside the camera.
*car.
00,10it's the perception of movment with no felt movement that made me sick
I have motion sickness now
and I DON'T GET MOTION SICK!
13now.... jason's just driving recklessly now... he's giving eomer more reason to believe that's him...
GODDAMN IT TRANSITIONS!

Mom's comment: Indian traffic is HORRIBLE
Hold. The. Camera. Still.
13i'm more amazed that FMLE is keeping up
FMLE?
13stream
00,10this is like a replay in grantrismo with the camera set to random.
On a related note, famous philosopher Plato was a two-time champion.
13was that like six cuts in a second....
or swome crap
00,10half the time the camera is looking the wrong way
Indian traffic looked awesome in The Darjeeling Limited
00,10must have been a bitch to film this
i like the camera work, i honestly think it's a matter of personal preference
/me note to self, DO NOT jack stream visuals to 47 inch TV, ugh:(
00,10set up 15cameras for 4 seconds of filming
Shake the camera! (like a failsauce)
13editors must have been "you want me to make that how short?"
Shaky cam AND Macroblocks?

TIME SHIFT!
00,10er moving
TIME SHIFT LOLA TIME SHIFT!
13yeah that'll work...

13CPR underwater...
Don't fuck with Plato.

He'll wrestle you.

13jason caught the idiot ball today
00,10just there have been time you have missed me
00,10wrek on the other hand
Well that would have been depressing, if this wasn't the first ten minutes.
11,01They finally got someone good to kill her. Couldn't get it done in the first movie.
13where a character does something uncharacteristically stupid
:( Shaky cam, Macroblocks, no Rifftrax, and I've been up for 30 hours.
I hate disconnecting.

AMNESIA?!?
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
Hai Stryker!

Dungeon Defender is 75% off again. And this time, it's ALL 75% off. Even all of the DLC
Before, only some of the DLC was on discount and there was no complete collection deal.
00,10"You were a little hard on the beaver last night Ward."
Dat chin dent.

Aside from the whole "dying" part, yeah.
Not downhill.

He's only one year from retirement.
Japan is Awesome!
Nothing goes downhill in Congress. Only sideways.
Con is the opposite of Pro
$12.49

And to cons make a pro.

And Damon's like "....this is my bland face. I'm acting. :|"
Wow, this movie is a LOT shorter than the first one.
Dumbass.
13otakon: it's a little shorter
13but they're both around 2 hours
00,10ahh
00,10perhaps I was thinking of radio
1310 minutes isn't that much shorter
that's a episode of ponies difference
13besides, blame it on the fast cuts :3
Blame it on the boogy.

Oh, that's right. The magazine.
Operation Moonstone was doing well, the Clefable are still under our control
and laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag
13the script for this part read "grunt, grunt, GRUNT, grunt"
I am having a hard time following this action... dumb camera
yeah, i got de circle too
05,15But it was more popular in the 60s
13operation gallstone caused all kinds of problems

Operation Oliverstone brought us some good movies
13X3
13well enough of that intrigue let's have us some KABOOMS
Dammit I was going to make the kidneystone joke...
CK, Vicodin helps :p
Operation Blowshitup successful
05,15Operation Whetstone was rather dull
Vicodin? Screw that. Give me the morphine.
13X3
13so many puns!
ALL the puns. All of them.
Operation Digistone was Lackluster and poorly thought out plotwise
05,15Operation Cornerstone collapsed
that feel when lost cause you dont get any of the things
Operation Keystone was vital but ultimately formed a weak point.
Operation hewnstone is still floating around somewhere
Operation Thunderstone had a electrifying end
13operation hearthstone keeps going back to base
rofl
Operation Flagstone was trampled underfoot
13fluttercry won :3
Operation Sandstone had a lot of layers to it.
Operation Silverstone was pretty pricey
Operation Sandstone was a bit rough too.
05,15yay I win!
11,01Operation Sandstone got glassed over.
I imagine Operation Blarneystone had a lot of folks puckering up.
Operation Rosetta was informative to say the least
I was going to go with Operation sandstone wore out after time
mmm, pizza
The whole Operation Brimstone thing stinks
oh...berlin
The puns are distracting me from the movie XD
Operation Steppingstone was a great jumping off platform
LOL
05,15Operation Coblestone was too loosely organized
Operation Birthstone is Diamonds
/me was born in April
Operation Stoned is...woah, I have hands.
Operation Capstone was considered their crowning achievement.
(\
Operation Cornerstone holds it all together

For example, one of Haku's brother's is the embodiment of action

Night yall
Also, Fluttershy dragons :D
Not just AN idea, but all ideas
It is dificult for some to understand
Eh, you can have it
Think multidimensionally
That is one way of putting it, I suppose
00,02i think that worked
He existed since FORRRREEEEVVVVEEEERRRRRRRR
might need a reset?
I dont like constantly re-installinh
*installing
hai everypony. :3
Oh, the Skyrim?
And idea

00,02i'm catching fish
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, k
lol, fish
Fish are weird
Always witht he "glub glub" and "I cant breathe on land" and "Please dont eat me." Selfish basturds.
It's kinda special that half of the time fish has taste, half of the time it doesn't.
Fish isnt that healthy anymore
you should only eat fish once every 3 months
Too much mercury in them now
I'm allergic to most seafood :(
Although I geuss you CAN eat them, but again, its not really healthy anymore
Which makes my fiance sad, 'cause she loves eating fish
Well, I geuss its also with how much fish you eat too when you actually eat fish
00,02um
00,02where did skyrim go
GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
There it goes :P
Well my stream already crashed :D
00,02skyrim wont let go of my mouse
And... having shelter is unhealthy?
00,02oh
Its not about humble jobs, its about there not being any jobs!
00,02so thats how you run
00,02wat
EVen the jobs that teens should have are being taken by adults
00,02it isnstant crashes when it tries to load the city

Go to a fast food joint today and you tell me how many people working there might be in high school
00,02well
00,02um

There is only one way I would buy Battlefield 4. That is if is a future shooter.
Like Battlefield 2142.
1942 was the best
128 player servers was intense
yes

It was.
the helicopters were a bit of a pain though
to fly
In single player they were ez to fly
