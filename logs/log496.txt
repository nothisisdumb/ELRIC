kangaroojac: CHARLIE!
superretroworld: By scaring them on a boat ride from hell?
8,6told my friend if he didn't stop asking stupid questions he'd get a kick to the face
Wonka's monologue was one of the few precisely word for word bits in noth the novel and movie. It's also part of why it's very vry creepy when you read the book. They happied it up a lot for the movie-- until now.
Oh goody just arrived in time for Rifftrax!!!
His name is Salt, and his business is nuts.
HERE IT COMES! :D
FlareChaser: you here buddy !
Kencolt: oh God

FlareChaser: that's great , at least one of us is happy
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
WHAT WAS THE POINT
Shizuka: <3 Amnesia
Again, thanks god THIS wasn't in the remake, thanks you Mr. Burton, you saved a million of lives in danger.
And they all die
Then Cthulhu ate them
FlareChaser: I wish there was a bronycon near me :'(
VenHur96, it was in a way
Or DO THEY?!
FlareChaser: you couldnt go to Bronycon yourself?
sagas: He's not supposed to be doing anything of the sort. It's just that crap happens. IN the book, he takes EVERYTHING in stride. As I said, the Burton version is much closer to the book in plot and tone.
GET ME OFF OF THIS DAMN THING

GabeMoist: that would involve opening up your chi points
so yeah, having more resolve than that motherfucker...
RAWRity, that's why Amon is best pony
Dat Journey
RAWRity: was that willpower? or something else?
not likely
Amon is hax... all hax
amon is probbably a cyborg ;)
that PMV
stupid internet is stupid
00,10clearly amon is sweetiebot.
Next do eye of the tiger
NullRadix: right now all we have to go on is this: Tarlokk tried to bloodbend Amon. Amon just fucking WALKED over and bitchslapped him.
crashes every hour, on the hour basically
clearly Sumica
really, one would suspect Bloodbending to be nothing about willpower, unless you could .... counter bloodbend yourself?
8,6Amon is Aang's secret love child nobody every knew about and is butthurt that he got no love from daddy
kirzstryfe: seems legit
kirzstryfe: or, he's secretly Zuko's son.
kirzstyrfe umm, okay . . .
that seems like the best possible explanation
RAWRity: or it is ZUKO
that...thats actully sounds legit
NullRadix: Perhaps he is really buff?
8,6RAWRity, never said with who ;p
I agree with RAWRity
buff would have nothing to do with it
or, he's Aang and Katara's other son, Bumi, who is upset at being the only non-bending child of the Avatar, and want to take out his daddy issues on the whole world.
kirzstryfe, dun dun DUUUUUN
heres amon and twilight http://fav.me/d5156oy
00,10You are all wrong. it's iroh.
panda_ Zuko worked with Aang to build Republic City and taught him Fire Bending
oh even better could be Zuko or Zuko's sone? or did i miss that Zuko is already ded
THIS PMV
because it's actually said on Nick.com's background page that Tenzin is the only Airbender of aang and Katara's children.
I think I got diabetes
Prick: Zuko's alive.
ok...i guess i gotta go finish from last ive seen avatar
/me bobs head
he left his daughter to reign as Firelord, and now travels the world as a peace ambassador
Twilight would die before losing her magic
most of what goes on in your body is liquid related. The question is why it's so hard to "access" that liquid to perform bloodbending
OH BOY
WANT YOU GONE!
*sigh* already seen this
wow
portal! :D
CUE REMIX!
panda:
panda_
well this should be interesting
xmasskills: whats up?
is this what i think it is
panda_: i know about everything
its not so much hard to do, rather no one wants to teach it
xmasskills: what did I do now?
00,10NullRadix cause much like metal bending, they have to feel the bits they can controll
NullRadix: probably has to do with bending something you can't see yourself, as well as working it against the muscles and whatnot
okay, now I'm really pissed off at my computer's internet, and the current stream isn't helping . . .
oh did you think i ment you? :P
Amon may be a water bender and that's how he countered bloodbending
Amon doesnt have bending powers
How do we know?
finished this game last week
Midnight_Tempest, how can you say that?
we don't
I'm still going with "The spirits, most likely Koh, are fucking with the Avatar."
what does amon have? :O
Amon is a robot. The end
Midnight_Tempest: that we KNOW OF
CrimsonPhoenix: cause i can... its all speculation anyway
FUCK YEAH!
.hack!
Oh wow
Midnight_Tempest: but Amon can bend bending powers...
that helba
Been a long time since I have last seen this.

Shamroc: I never said it correlates to mlp
hey everypont

Right before that happened, I was thinking "I wonder if it's really a good idea to knock the bridge out from UNDERNEATH of it."
And then it landed on his head.
/me explodes twice
Ponies47: you are either trolling or HORRIBLE at following directions

So what game is this?
/me hugs Resonantwaves

MahBoi777: lol they have been happening to me too

Sumica: what do them blips mean?
I had a girl who said, and this is the actual quote. "Hey do you wanna go out with my friend ****(censored out for privacy)? She has asked everyother boy in the class."
gameplay>graphics
who cares what halo 4 looks like? its just another game...
TheRandomkid321: lol
Ok where we're we?
Ah, being last picked. Brings back memories.
TheRandomkid321: what did you say?
so what its going to be badass
Phase4: say it again for Ponies47
i will take a game with a story and good gameplay over a good looking game anyday
I am sick... Not as sick as I was 2 weeks ago but sick.
My brother has somehow snapped his debit card
Bad memories, but pretty much every memory below age 18 qualifies there...

Marx: sounds awesome..

cher3ry: i thought i was on the east...im on the west..
hey Magical_pablez94
Set it to Los Angeles
hey Magical_pablez94
or just -8 gmt
I believe
cher3ry: doesnt give the option for los angles..
hey you guys got gmod?
Yeah, it's GMT -8:00 Pacific Time
I do
metalzeldapony: that makes it 9 pm...its 1am where im at..
cool
In Linux it's by city
Sumica: did nittany ever get his rocket to the moon?
or you for that matter
although those are just aliases for the appropriate GMT offsets
like gmod stuff?
also cher3ry its sayin UTC in my timezone selection..
I am dying in this room
It's too hot
pony_3xxMoopyxx: are you asking me?
hey does that game have co-op or no?
I just don't know what went wrong.
UTC and GMT are basically the same thing
Sumica mic is a lil to close you your nose
one hour offset
oh cool
GMT -8 is UTC -7
cher3ry: for it to be even REMOTLY close i had to do an atlantic zone in canada...
OMG
really its HOT there?
Atlantic is east coast...
Your ceiling fan goes 'yay'?
so Korra was interesting today
hey i need help, trying to connect via androoid irc client bit am having trouble getting it to work, i need the server and port, can anypony help me out?
cher3ry...only way for both my clock on my dresser and computer clock to be the same..
Did you get it at Ikea?
thats because your internal clock is using GMT or UTC...
no even better ceiling fan goes swa swa swa swa swa swa swa swa
you know your driving the wrong side of the road right Sumica
Boosh.
Change your timezone to the proper setting, then change your time to the correct actual time
if necessary
cher3ry: and what would my phone and digital clock be useing?
Pacific time.
whats this game?
stop and ask for directions!
Amon is starting to look a bit too OP
lol
Every time someone screams in this game, it's funny for some reason.
welp cher3ry its on gmt -8 set at 1:54 am now......and in about 20 minutes its gonna zoom 3 hrs into the future
:O
oh hey guys on call of duty black ops look at my emblem mines way beeter then yalls
It shouldn't, if your timezone is correctly set to GMT-8 pacific.
YaY i wanna talk wit the police c:
I just figured out what's wrong with this game.
It needs MOAR EXPLOSIONS!
fuck me .....IM FREE FOR
soo tired
cher3ry: its set to this (UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)
You probably have time syncronization to time.windows.com or something similar set active - it's on by default I believe.
Like some of that!
cher3ry: at that made it 9 pm of yesterday..
Go into your time settings, and turn OFF automatic time syncronization.
cher3ry: it is...again my computer derps...time wise at least
hey sumica when this all over what are going to do next?
ugh 5 days of constant music making
cher3ry: kk turned of internet sync
YaY
That should stop anything from changing your computer's clock but you.
Dick Shep is best Shep
Ugh I know what you mean JRP. There are only so many things you can do with dubstep.

hahaha

yeah that rocket is very big
LET THE POWER OF DESTROUCTION LIFE OFF!
that's alot of wieght to haul
Aim for the moon Mica!
Can he build it? YES HE CAN@
Bluestrom_S1: just wait for it
Bluestrom_S1..its actualy farily well built
oh my
Shamroc: As an accident. XD
A biproduct is a event that should not be foreseen
those solid rocket boosters aren't necessary really on his stage 8, 7, and 6
THENSE! The rocket!
Or "That other rocket"
Sumica : are you going to try to go to the moon to see if Luna is there?
Hey sumica im going to go watch some MLP umm i guess i will see you later then maybe?
Too The Moon!
Bluestrom_S1: i dont know why...but you are starting to piss me off..
eeyup catch you later dude
We're breaking the Atmosphere soon!
:(
Vegeta, what the the scouter say about the altitiude?
If you accelerate a rocket too fast, will your astronaut dudes die?
R-Dash5000: jokes been made many times
IT'S OVER 9000!!!
nope, he's still in breathable air. For a little bit longer anyway
Shamroc: No, that's just your attitude, Shammy
Sumica will you go to the moon?
oh one last thing do you have an xbox elite? sumica?
Leave them in orbit... FOREVER!
YaY
Mine survived in orbit for more than 1000 days. I quit out because I needed to reboot
Damn!
Vordox: i have an attitude? *LE :O*
17,000... 18,000... 19,000...
i wish you could
Bluestrom_S1: Don't mind Shamroc, he's like Dan vs..just less.
20,000!!!!
You must have put a lot of astronaut food into their rocket.
they recycle their.... you know, Imma just stop right there
well anyways later sumica
Sumica has my friend said before if you can go bigger then you're thinking like a real rocket man
30,000...
When they start the love machine and I can love again, I'll remember what it was.
YaY
Real..rocket man Bluestrom_S1 XD
Vordox...i only said that because my brain is makin him sound condecending making others feel stupid with his knowledge of a video game..
see you later every pony
Oh, hello everypony.:)
oh hai TheRainbowDash
Shamroc: It's like your talking in L4D2, so the same things applies to you?
its ok, I've been at this game for abit a year now Vordox so I got a nerdgasm when I'm seeing it in bronystate
you're
OMG OMG OMG Sumica
Bluestrom_S1: well, don't drop too much info on new players, it can be kind of a "I don't want to play this anymore" vibe.
I'm not the mare you think I am at home, oh no, no no, I'm a rocket maaaaare... o/~
Mica: Where's the moon!? D:
Vordox....say wat? i dont talk like that...im over confident......and because of that boastfull.. i dont condecend others....
yeah, honestly I don't if sumica is actually reading the chat
100.000.0
100,000 down, 285,000 to go.
Shamroc: Over confident on situations. :P But I don't care, that's your and that's that. I have huge issues too as well, but...meh
130,000... 140,000...
Vordox...i cant tell but somthing seems off about what you just said.....i dont know why..
any1 else watch korra
150,000...
It's trolling you. It's on the other side of the planet
Shamroc: "I know what I am doing, you don't" <--- This vibe comes from you from the few times I played with you.
It's decelerating.
look at those happy kerbals
Be careful, that sneaky planet Nibiru might hide behind the sun and then pop out and shank your shuttle when you aren't looking.
Shamroc: But as I said, we all have our small crap that comes through sometimes. >< Hate that as I am overly confident as well
It's a ninja planet.
their having a blast
185,000 down, 200,000 to go to the moon.
Sumica : Friendship cannon is loaded
Vordox.......you've played with me? oh god im confused now....uh uh uh.....LOOK A FROG
200K!
yes sumica
Uh, okay....
Shamroc: OH! Is it Suwako1
Shallow burn, shallow burn, not too steep.
Towards the planet is usually recommended.
Tooo theeee mooooon!
Vordox: i have NEVER seen that name....or can re-call atm..
211K.
Shamroc: I'm very forgettable, deliciously advantage for some times. :P
IT'S GOING DOWN!!!!
Hello?
Vordox: but back to im better than you thing....i never remember talking like that...i only remember telling people to help me or help others...and say come on lets hurry the hell up
Exactly 100 people here.
Hello?
R-Dash5000...cow
Shamroc: You usually never notice your own faults.
that's gonna be a pretty orbit tho
200,000 and counting...
That's NOT going...to end well...
UH OH OUTTA GAS!
T minus 3 minutes.
00,02why is the rcs fighting itself?
Vordox...again im thinking back to todays game....cant think of any times i was saying im better than you..
Uh oh, hot dog.
R-Dash5000: Until crash landing?:D
Yes.
Okay...
WOO BACKUP!
Shamroc: You got pissed off when someone helped you and you said "I can handle myself" even clearly when you were dying/Getting pounced. :P
2m 20s.
make it spin Sumica it looks cool
you've got a lot of apogee to work with now tho
Nose diving again?
Vordox...i do NOT re-call ever saying such a thing....i would prob say fuuu someone get tme the hell up i need to kill the douche who incaped me
You need to make the planet spin the other way Sumi.
T minus 1m 50s.
hey, is that a new version?
Shamroc: Guess it's kinda impossible to remember when you have forgotten it ><
No orbit. :(
well... didja make it?
Vordox: isnt that what remembering is?
Below 100,000! :(
close
Shamroc: Yeah but you don't.
but no success
keep at it Sumica you've almost got it
nose diving.
Vordox: can you give me a relative time during the game i said that?
About...1 month ago
Time: 5:30 am EST/4:30 am CST/2:30 am PST.
well, yeah, that design has the power to reach escape velocity, so it _can_ reach orbit.
85... 84... 83...
Vordox...youre talking about 1 thing i said a month ago...filly please im much better now......why be condecending when you can help others roll with your skills
can we watch pony today?
never ask for pony here.
T -1m 45s.
pony_3072: shaddup
pony_3072: you came into chat at the dead zone...soo nope no ponys for you..
Sumica : they need a Barf Bag
you get 3.5 when you do
silly pony_3072 pony season ended
full version or demo?
T minus 2m 45s
T minus 2m 30s

what are you on about R-Dash5000?
T minus 1m 40s
Vordox... i mean where you here during the all-star game agaisnt the mods?
Shamroc: Trying to get in the lottery :P

10, 9, 8, 7,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
Oh.
inb4 your engines from previous flights stay in space
oh hey, water is actually water now
Another one!
Hi everypony, I see we're breaking the game again.
GlutenFreeJenkins: Great, you made me lose the game.
I just lost too if that makes you feel any better. [|]w[|]
welp everypony im off
good night
Bye Shamroc
aye same here
Sleep well.
AAAAH!
good night everyone
NOW I know why I love AJ even more O.o
Night Bluestrom_S1
nite Shamroc
She reminds me of Joan D'arc
...wat
Take off.
lol what is this game?
yep
She's the most closest to human then anyone of them O.o
Past 1,000 meters.
yes mica
00,02its gona achive escape
Will it break Solar orbit?
Past 2,000.
00,02so infinite distance
Sumica, do thrusters and fuel tanks from previous flights persist into the next flights?
Past 3,000.
hello......ive waited here for you.........Everlooong
...
Earth's escape velocity is 11.2 km/s. The Sun's is 617.5. So I doubt you can achieve solar escape
He did yesterday. >_<
Sumica: there's mods for that. full replacement sets and stuff
Well, I'm guessing :D
Lolk. ^_^
Vegeta, what the the scouter say about the altitiude?
IT'S OVER 9000!!!
Here we go. :3
BRB.
uhhhhhhh
whoops
dafuq
i don
no sun for you
they doomed
Oh crap.
well, that was ....a climactic finale
t recognize the names of the astronauts. what happened to jebediah=
built by the lowest bidder.
have fun dieing
How 'bout the moon.
time to go where no man has gone before...
eyyup
Fail.
haha
lolololol
Damn lag.
K.I.A
Wait, what...:D
There are just terrorists camping the spawn point
does anyone knows a non megaupload download link for Amnesia?
I'd like to play it, but cannot find a valid link...
one does not simply launch a rocket without a countdown
NNnnnope Magical_pablez94
ANYPONY ELSE?
In German, und English, I know how to count down... und I'm learning Chinese, says Werner von Braun
Lag?
I wonder if you can fly around the planet somehow
That might be that the engine doesn't get enough time to process things when time is warped
you mean... orbit?
:|
"...Rocket engine burning fuel so fast , up into the night sky so vast, burning metal through the atmosphere, earth remains in worry hate and fear, with the hateful battles raging on, rockets flying to the glowing sun, through the empires of eternal void, freedom from their final suicide..." clearly Sabbath foresaw exactly what you are doing now ^^
00,02we'll go at night XD
:3
Sumica is best comedian
uhhhhhh
those astronauts do not look happy
00,02sas is on?
that didn't look promising
Past 40.
The middle one is actually scared?
GlutenFreeJenkins: ikr he used to be so happy
Yeah...
so you like sunbathing ? well do we have a treat for you!
00,02i played this for 10 min a while ago, got into space and allmost into orbit
slipping free of the surly straitjacket of Earth's feeble gravitational pull...
00,02then my staging failed
00,02and it span to the earth
00,02parachute worked though
Would anyone like to come to #bronyfunds the chat is withering away.
00,02XD
Is it almost 6:00 am?
00,02i didnt put a seperator there actualy, worked anyway
00,02well... i hit water
00,02no fule tank, had a seperator for that
00,02fuel'
00,02*derp*
the clusters can draw fuel from anywhere
there's so much blue in this chat.
Dat Phase.
00,02i thought you ment the liquid tanks for some derp reason
whats your final speed gonna be ?
00,02rcs tank was attached
:o
00,02map?
XD
Lol, I loved that.
lol
00,02XD
wait you sent two to orbit?
aren't orbits supposed to be ellipses?
solar orbit I mean
lets hope that dirtbag moon doesnt pull you off course
lol
TrixieBaconMuffin: i dont think he needs to worry about that now
whats your speed ?
00,02its about 3KM/s
00,023.8 i think
OMG 1.000.000.0
DEAR SWEET CELESTIA!! 1 MILLION!!
because you're approaching apogee.
slowly, but approaching it
because I have done this before. :D
that and you're still climbing, therefore approaching apogee
00,02he's achived escape
00,02there is no apogee
for his solar orbit there is.
00,02true
why are the astronauts scared at the bottom of the screen?
00,02but he's going for impact, not orbit
fuck this awful connection.
1.5 M.
we shall see!
00,02Sumica, dont think the rcs is doing much, i'd save the fuel
00,02i say right as he turns it off XD
yay
What is the world coming to when you can't even crash a ship into the sun
so at 8 lightminutes to the sun that will take him about .... 2 years ? or did i gravely miscalculate ?
00,02moah fire!
"I just proposed a settlement to dick with them" lol
well... huh.
It's almost 6 pm here.
yay\
00,02whered the sun go?
00,02lol clipping
I thought you were going for impact?
I don't think you're gonna hit your target there.
ah
ah, yes...
00,02the thing shows it
00,02horizion view thing
10.000.000.0
._.
It's 6 am EST/5 am CST/3 am PST.
11:00am BST
just 11k more speed to lose
00,02dont think you have enough fuel XD
00,02yeah
00,02but that would still be a lot of speed
so your guys are "still" panicing ? shouldnt they star accepting their fate and kill themselves ?
i built a all liqud fuel rocket
Sweet celestia, is he actually gonna go to you?
00,02XD
00,02dem massive orbits
:o
you slow as you approach appogee, no matter how far you are from it
00,02yeah.... you're aproaching Ap... i cant spell that word
sumi if that other solar orbit is still moving it might meet up with your current one
00,02i'ma go get some food
yep
they do cross after Apeugee though Sumica
00,02wow, you are loosing a lot of speed
00,02dont think you'll hit the sun but you will bleed most of it off
but he'll gain it back on the other side...
Hahaha:D
he'll also pick it all back up after appogee
00,02suddenly spiderman
00,02food time

The mascot of Aperture Science.
Yesterday I had a party at my house with some new friend. After they had left I found out one of my oldest friends had downloaded some MLP p*rn on my pc, which coulda been easily misclicked as we were using spotify and utube. He also knew I was going to have new people over. I literally told him to f*ck off after that. So who went over the line, me or him?
In the video screens at the beginning and end of the single player game, he's the character seen demonstrating evacuation procedures and such.
new friends*
But I'm not coffee

did he do it as a prank a la , look at this guy with the pony porn ? or is he a clopper ?
As a prank cuz he know I'm a MLP fan but I don't like clopping
What a jerk
thanks Kandarihu
probably him then Shimmer
Shimmer: he
Shimmer him, but you should have talked with him more and let him explain why he did that
well its about to be 6 am and the sun is up, imma go to sleep bye everypony :)

a prank that would lead to bad reputation is very dangerous

So many long anmed ponies, lol

Phase4 or do what superbrony did and set up a solar orbit
00,02XD
The Professor Portal achievement is given to those players who already completed co-op for taking someone who's never done co-op before.
the hell is this cloud they mentioned
00,02that was interesting
00,02alexxm,

CCCP: Hiya!
Oh, the conflict between parallel Cave Johnsons. I listened to a whole 30 minute reel and it's FUNNY!
well done
Kandarihu lolwut?
is that alternate universe thing canon for portal 2 or did the fans come up with it?
wasnt mentioned in portal one, i think
Er, a 30 minute reel of Cave Johnson in the PeTI
it still doesn't have very many followers, not like my derpy blog at 820+ followers
Hiya Spitfire!!!
Dark_Horst Valve made a own video about selling their stuff to alternate universes, so i guess that could be canon
Cave Johnson wasn't mentioned in the original Portal, he was only patched in by Valve somewhat before Portal 2 launched
WorldTraveler: Oh just rub it in why dont we
oi Drake
/me pokes
Invi: can i find that on youtube?
04whaaaaaaat?
how many does your WorldTravler blog have then
check your PMs on my net
culex PM'd you
00,02i died
Dark_Horst yes. like every appature science invetion thingy ^^
Dark Horse, the horse of Sin?
04I noticed
your stream is a but delayed, Phase4. You said it before we saw it
00,02i know
Dark_Horst but I'm nit sure about the name of the video, but it should be on the Valve Youtube channel
water kills you then
Appleture Science
[23:24:32] <@culex> Ugh

lmfao
well the, to youtube
04why is he putting up with me then
cus' he needs data for his server
lol
You can test if you want to. You can leave your pants behind. Because my friends all test and if you don't test, well you're... no friend of mine.
And you will find that a lot of people don't like coloured text tbh
04yeah I've noticed
It actually is very annoying
Kabaka: Yay 80s parodies!
I don't mind because I'm used to it and my background doesn't really clash with anything except the 0 colour
But yeah, most people hate it
whoops, ment Kandarihu
and...dead

He's a very intelligent guy

well there you go :P
So, don't be judgmental of him either
and then what happened d3rb

He's kinda like me
d3rb: Thats good. Introspection of ones life is good
well he did say he's a self proclaimed <censored>

so basically had a mini mental breakdown about how much things suck at the moment and just wondering when im gonna see the light at the end of this very dim tunnel
anyway
/me claps
/me hugs d3rb

/me hide
04I think he was just being polite to me.
mmm?

04culex
/me hugs d3rb "Itll be ther"
how o-o
04Because he didn't say that to my face?
*there
!swearkick off
Swear kickers are now off.
I suppose
04These are separate conversations.
do you have to do the launch thing , or can you put blue on the wall , yellow on the ground , go through and shoot blue on the floor too , getting launched upward instead of sideways ?
Drake
I personally hate two-facedness
He's just like that
so bleh/
*.
yeah it will, 99% of the time my outlook on life is either she'll be right or it could be worse so im not used to feeling down, hits me hard
He's a pretty cool guy once you get to know him
Dat me.
Funnily enough we hated each other for literally an entire year
haha

04I'd rather not SPOIL THE MOOD

Alchemist: Well good morning!

I made some rather sarcastic comment the other day

I don't think she took it well
Hey Alchemist :D
Oh well

I shall continue to disappoint you until you fail to be disappointed
04/sarcasm for clarification

JRP2234: Yes?
hello GlutenFreeJenkins
Ello meine liebe Lil_B (is that right?)
/me hugs Espeon
I won the race the other night
I blasted to the moon
I admire these people. I will have a job interview in 3 weeks at a tanning factory. If I make then I might be able to donate to stuff.
Malavolent: ???
^_^
Malavolent: Kinda busy at the moment actually. :$ But still, congratulations!
Only to get a parachute failure before landing
:D
deep web is a dangerouse place....
to explode and die on the moon
00,02this should go well
To Luna!
Sarcasm makes the world go around.
And hats.
Ninjazz: That's really nothing to celebrate, just pm me when you want to know how it went. :)
Hi :3
Phase4: It wont
Malavolent nope, unless I'm a girl and you want to be charming XD (or I'm a Large Audience...) just "Hallo" is fine :)
oh hi Ninjazz ^^
hi Lil_B ^^
Malavolent: Alright. :)
Hey Invi! :D
Lil_B: mein liebe? It has to be!
hi Invi;)
00,02i seem to be hovering
O.o
hi Lil_B...
00,02no
00,02climbing
00,02just slowly
/me attacks Invi with hugs "How you been, man?"
/me hugs Lil_B and Ninjazz
Oh damn o_o
LOL
Wow
hi WallDives ;)
WallDives: Hai
more power!
Hi WallDives
Hey Phase4, what is the furthest you got?
What game is this?
I've been here >.>
00,02this is only the second launch i've done in this game
Ninjazz that were the best 4 days of my life :D
00,02perhaps less fule
/me noms WallDives
Lil_B: Hi there!
This is...random.
left shidt....FULL POWER
:3
hi Alchemist ;)
04Hi
00,02allso i have no control surfaces
04How are you Espeon?
Invi: What do you mean?
Oops
You're probably screwed then
Damn, I'm hungry. BUt there is actually nothing in the house I can eat. D:
Eat the house
Ninjazz Ninjazz i was 4 days at the metalfest in Loreley
What's the goal here?
luna
to hit anything but earth ^^
hi TrixieBaconMuffin :)
Shimmer: The house contains Gluten. D:
Ah. Alright then.
CrazyCherry http://youtu.be/EqJCEhE4tz4
hi CCCP
Ninjazz \m/
Pretty decent!
who needs secure rockets anyway
^_^
And you people/assorted things?
dat wobbly rocket
just adds weight
It's just dancing.
looks safe
I love how Erbert is the only one smiling
Then again, he's always smiling
JRP2234: Da fuq....
Erbert is always smailing. :3
00,02this is going far too well
^
Dat surprisingly appropriate dog.
CrazyCherry watch it all
Lil_B: this is just for you. I will send you a picture, something chemistry related. Can you tell me whats wrong with it?
If your plans are proceeding without a disruption or a hitch, you have walked into a trap.
Alchemist well... I'll try my best ;)
IT'S A TARP
Space again?
Lil_B: here it is: http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/41/fnykp0060.jpg
04I'm alright, just sketching stuff 5 minutes before midnight
getting low on fuel.....
/me just realised the time
Just make sure it's not on EASY MODO
Hah x3
/couldnotresistmakingajoke
Haa
You're spinning uncontrollably
are we going to the moon again?
Lil_B: you dont have to think about anything fancy.
trying to valoreins|Work
00,02well
now they are screwed
00,02that kinda worked
Gotta love the middle guy.
Erbert is best Kerb
Alchemist wait, I'm trying to get the right words XD
dam
Ninjazz i even met a brony :)
what's the apogee on that thing
Deep wide bell wonder. Ok then.
can u actually achieve orbit with this game?
Invi: Nice! Who was his favorite pony? :D
Phase4 are you gonna nuke the Earth?
Alchemist you normaly use it to seperate 2 liquids... there shouldn't be something solid in there
WorldTraveler: Yeah
awww crap
how?
Sumica did it yesterday and started orbiting the sun
Lil_B: thats correct :D
00,02oh poo
lol.
Haha
00,02forgot the detatch for the rcs fuel
Love how they all smile
lololol
:D
HHNNNGGGG
And then they burnt up on re-entry.
00,02well
Ninjazz Rainbow :D but i had no oppotunity to talk with him much :(
Lil_B: its a seperating funnel. And what you see is 300 dollars worth of experiment going out the window :D
WEE
Phase4: You opened WAY to early
00,02meh
Alchemist because thats Professional work right there XD
Invi: Atleast we know we're not alone. :$
I hope we will eventually get on the moon.
Well what was the point of that? You went up and back down
00,02Landed
I've already made it to the moon a few times
Sumica almost got it yesterday.
But I landed dead
Lil_B: its actually an experiment of mine, and it turned out a chemical I ordered had impurities in it that killed the reaction.
Very_Silly_Filly: How so?
Phase4: The stream is horribly delayed.
Malavolent: I got a parachute failure
Sploosh.
Ninjazz how was the end of the challenge? :D
Very_Silly_Filly: Well, that's not nice.
00,02probably
So I plummeted and exploded and died
Phase4: Like 30 sec+
Lil_B: glad my uni pays for it and not me.
Invi: Tiring... :$ I think my sleep pattern changed. :D
lol, I fell asleep at my desk :D
Alchemist oh, was supposed to happen?
I will be heading out though, so see yous
Your ships unstable. Phase4
Lil_B: nope. Should have had a reddish suspension and no precipitation.
00,02tis a bit
Needs more rockets.
04aww
Now give it 5 more engines and paint it with go faster stripes.
04bye
and more solar power from celestia
Give it flames!
This game, it confuzzels me
I wish i knew what all these parts do
spinners on the rocket outlets
Send it to the moon.
Lil_B: just thought I share the failure with someone :)
Put an xbox in the back seat hooked up to a giant monitor in the floor.
Whats the nuke button do?
This song is one of the best PMV out there <3
And a fish tank.
Alchemist: Sharing faliure? Sounds awesome
d3rb http://youtu.be/EqJCEhE4tz4 watch it all
its a pretty easy game to pick up sagas, pretty straight forward
what's the name of this PMV?
Mind the youtube links, JRP2234
JRP2234: DAMit man! No video links during stream!
Alchemist I had a mistake with these funnals recently too, but it was totally my very own failure XD
Elondras: FlutterWonder
gahhhh...mega man 3, i got the nes cartridge for that
this song
MadSurge: thanks
opp i forget the pm
Lil_B: did it leak or something?
im tired as shit
lol, i can appreciate that
Alchemist i left open the funnel while inserting a sample... twice
00,02hmmm
00,02the bigger more powerfull engine
Add dynametric tail fins.
00,02or the slightly less powerfull one
00,02with thrust vectoring
Bigger
Discord: sharing one's failure might help those you share with :)
00,02bigger it is
Phase4 bigger is better
Tell that to Goliath.
00,02i'ma try this first then try figure a good way to attach more rockets
So this game literally turns you into a rocket scientist....
You must construct additional rockets.
is this tf2?
Tax the fight was unfair. David had a range weapon
oh no
Lil_B: it sounds to be correctable.
Invi: lol
To Luna! Again!
so far so good
Just by looking at the top I can tell this will fail somewhat
I like the part where it wiggles
looks unstable though... or maybe its just me...
oh dear...
Looks like it really should have been built to spin.
god im wearing earphones @.@
YokusaHHart, bad question incoming, but Hart Foundation mean anything to you?
00,02well
00,02that failed
You're fucked
And told you :P
12Theres jobs going to legoland
12how awesome is that
o.o
/me wants to play with the legos
oh my...
WallDives: Lol no, it part of my Psydonym, Meredith HeimdallHart
Yeah that thing is right out of there.
those astronauts seem like to be high as hell. Literally and figureatively.
why does he keep smiling? :D
ah.
ok, sorry.
back to lurking.
I want him to play amnesia
Keep thrusting
^ lol
It's okay, I can understand the confusion...
try to hit the launchpad
this seems like it shouldn't do this
Aim for the ground and go into it
00,02all in all
It seems like he's on his way to becoming a pavement pancake.
00,02that went well
00,02so far no ones died
00,02thats not right
00,02MOAR ROCKETS
Alchemist we had 1 Sample(Liquid) and we took 3x10ml out there into cups so everything could evaporate, after that we had to dissolve the solid ramins in water and fill it into the funnel, i left it open and everything went on the table
time for Amnesia :D
Why is there so much science!?
because science is awesome^^
Lil_B: ouch, then it I retract my previous statement :D
Alchemist 2 times, fortunatly the 3 time i did it right and the Titration was still good enough for me to get a B Grade
MOAR GO FAST STRIPES!!!
Why don't you just make a really big catapult and launch it that way? :P
if at first you don't succeed, more rockets!
Phase4: Here's an idea, add like a massive pillar, full of thrusters and fuel
Alchemist *Titration afterward we did something in the funnel... i forget what axactly we did in there :/
That's how I managed to get to the moon
i just joined. what are we watching
00,02hmmmmm
Lil_B: they dont give much time to do an experiment i presume.
Lil_B: chemistry ISA?
Who always broadcasts these streams?
I think its Phase4
Loads of different people
10!puellamagi
Skylands, you are 115Tomohisa Kaname.
00,02i'm streaming
Phase4
Can i broadcast mine
00,02nope
yay
There's like 10-15 different mods eho can stream
Alchemist they do, but not enought to start again from the very Beginning once you screwed up, but enough time to not have to do everything hastly
Capn_Gavn I don't know what ISA is, but I am learning in the field of chemistry currently ;)
investigative skills assesment
That will NOT list
Phase4: I don't think that is enough fuel...
Wants one less level of crap
Capn_Gavn: what exactly does that mean :)
00,02this looks good
dat giant Piano :D
Not sure that'll lift
It's an organ, silly
What is this game
dat Bach
oh wow
already a good start
00,02HOLY WHAT
00,02it works!
i did a chemistry A-level, got an overall D. ISA means pretty much a practical exam with a follow up paper
:)
Like a...something.
Can someone tell me what game is this
00,02this has no right to work
dat jiggling
Glad to help Phase4
so stable :D
:D
needs the metal support rods...
00,02lets see if it will blow up
Probably will
dat wiggle
dance rocket dance!
what is this game?
But that's what I did
and it got me to the moon
someone tell me?
kerbal space program
lol @ their faces
that right one doesn't look so happy
look st the astronauts xD
00,02its not gona blow up
Damnit, I have to Install Port Royale 3 again... the DLC screwed up the Update-Systhem :(
00,02how booring
Left one's never happy
Capn_Gavn: I think I understand :) Lil_B is in Germany (right?) and Im from Hungary so our educationa system is pretty different from the US/UK system.
Only the middle one looks like he hasn't pissed himself.
Erbert's always happy
its not fun without danger
Right is mood swing
04ohai Skylands
Tax he has the ''well, fuck'' face expression :D
Alchemist right... also Hungary... wow thats not that far away XD
Invi: he does come across as having accepted his fate more than anything else.
'dat music
the one in the middle is making me laugh :D
00,02i have no clue what happened there
Something stole my bike!
Phase4: Connection failure
00,02lol
That's why you use supports
lulwut

That rocket suuuuuuucked.
Phase4: consummate v's!

RaveBrony: There's a quick join game button on the start menu, "Start playing" or something like that.
RaveBrony: WELL, you can go on Equestrian gaming and go there.
Phase4 maybe too much air friction?
RaveBrony: Or there's the server browser.
WELCOME
that ship looks minmatar
O.o
RaveBrony: or just look for tags like brony and whatnot
needs more duct tape though
wings... u need wings
Meanwhile: Oh, ok. Ill look for that :P
needs more wingy bits
00,02Invi, nah
needs more sugar
FlareChaser: Ill try that as well :P
RaveBrony: or you van join me in a game, and then after go to your history and right click it ._.
and then favorite it
my internet derped i miss much
User0: I didD:... but im not sure what to look for in a server :D
alexxm: All you missed was fail.
This rocket looks doomed as well.
remember to but the spin things that counteract torque as well
FlareChaser: Thats what i did earlier... But it wouldnt let me D:
Is this game fun?
who pinged me my chat derped
:D
having a rocket like what you have would spin the rocket apart
RaveBrony: well, damn.
CCCP: it is entertaining, to say the least
FlareChaser: Then it said something about 'blacklisting' it O.o

the dangers of having a cup between the keyboard and mouse
NullRadix: very true.
now to achieve orbit you have to turn the spacecraft perpendicular to the grund

What is this shitty looking game...
Barbetos: We need less explosive potatoes
Ufhhh
kerbal space program Dusty_Nomad
and its not shitty
I can't figure out the bloody equation
Petrified_Discord I suppose but then it is less fun.
Phase4: Less esplosion, more succes.
By saying shitty looking, you're judging it by the graphics

alexxm: ikr
MadSurge: ah so the originals? I see, Slwobeef I've heard of before but never seen any, Diabetus is pretty much uknown to me.

Vordox doing a let's is more than just not using save state
/me farts
ACS13123: Oh, nothing, just talking to myself...:|
Apparently...
13hm, what is this with Dubstep? listening to skrillex now, sounds kinda...party-ish?

CrimsonPhoenix: still, I see Save Staets as cheating =P
you have to be entertaining, informative, fun
WindWhistler: No i want to know
/me never listens dubstep
:P
derpy
Vordox, of course it is
Derpy
That reminds me...somehow the file I'm using for Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is hacked.
Derpy <3
:P
No one in my family knows how it got like that.
derpeh is watching you. :P
03wtf @ the start of this Code Geass DVD
that's why let's plays with save state are retarded
WindWhistler: you talkin bout chao garden?
Today's my birthday party, where's my bucking presents? ):<
Whenever I start it, I always have 94 lives.
03they're apparently having a cross-dressing festival
WindWhistler hows it hacked
ACS13123: Yeah.
WindWhistler: which game?
alexxm: All the levels have A ranks, but the characters don't have their upgrades
ACS13123: Sonic Adventure 2: Battle
Six flags commercial.
Plus I always start out with 94 lives.
But the Chao Garden isn't hacked.
wha wha wha wha

WindWhistler: Wha-?
MFW.

Scrambled word is "ttrsene". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
YES
03wtf, why did it start with that and not the episode
WindWhistler: nothin...
That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4015 Points.

Vordox: You mean flankholes?

DAMNIT I'm not supposed to laugh..
Derpy is cute when she lies down :3
Who is streaming?
Since I don't have Iron Gate's final mission unlocked on my file
Nittany_Discord, do Electrical beast
oh boy AVGN
Derpy is best pony.... that is until she got "fixed"
:O AVGN!
DIE HARD <3
11,01I've done an ElectricalBeast RP.
I HAVE THAT GAME
(On PSX)
11,01And an LP.
Forest Gump T.T
oh AVGN i watched this when he was still the angry nintendo nerd
Awwwwwh YEAAAAAAAAH
iammrcrap, she never really got fixed
dat waynes world
iammrcrap, even if she was fixed per the writers original intentions?
DERP. forgot about rainbow means Nittany_Discord
Oh my god we're watching this~ Nittany I love you~
the animation studio still brings her up here and there
iammrcrap: for just one episode.
11,01Retsuparae only did two RPs of ElectricalBeast
11,01This is an LJN ep.
Woo hoo~!
LJN...Okay that's the game I haven't had...ever.
Nittany: oh, God
Nittany_Discord: I have a question for you!
oh AVGN i watched this when he was still the angry nintendo nerd
Vordox: It's a game company~
MadSurge, actually, I've seen her "fixed" in the background on a few other eps
11,01Chains? Yes?
Nyria: I know of it...
11,01Nvm,
Nittany_Discord: I forgot it o_o
11,01It's Activision (when they still made games).
Nope, I can't connect to it..
what...is...this?
iammrcrap: they don't always make her walleyed
11,01I'll do a LJN.
MadSurge, I know
Nittany_Discord: Oh wait I remember! Are you Discord's sibling?
whatev
11,01Chains: Maybe.
iammrcrap, i don't know what you're talking about
13LJN, the little rainbow that guarantees you're gonna have a bad time
they're not always going to do what you want
I'm gonna restart my computer, brb
Okay! *Thumbs up*
I like The Until We Win Episode of Die hard
Shizuka: indeed :(
dat LJN </3
...wat?
What is this madness?
Sparta.
LJN
sux
big time
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 3Baltoy.
of course
Pardon me, sir, but is this Sparta?
I was satisfied witht the fact that Derpy's new voice is the one the writer wanted in the first place anyways
The reason why there is a counter is because in the Last Stage in Die Hard will contain ALL the Enemies you haven't shot up to this point
11,01Who would be the LJN of modern gaming?
dat Derpy cloud
Infinity ward?~
...
Chains: wut
Oh lol
Good question, Nittany_Discord.
Wow
Mmmmmh, crappy developper that tries too hard
11,01There might be quite a few.
Nittany_Discord: i dunno.... maybe THQ (when they make crappy movie games that is)
probably Ninja Theory
they have never made a good game
11,01Most movie games are crap.
Even though THQ Does produce SOME good games here and there
Most of them~
and Secret Level is dead so
Most.
Nittany_Discord ikr

Derpy
11,01There are a lot of companies that make me cringe when I see their name on a game TBH.
like what?
Nittany_Discord: Capcom's licensed games are almost always the exception luckily
!pokemon
i just backed the bronycon doc $10
like what Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: WestWood, Blizzard, Sierra, Midway?
11,01Quite a few.
valoreins|Work, I backed it up with 50 a while ago
Midway be dead
and
and Vordox not Blizzard
if its 10, i will be in the Thank you credits right?
didn't Midway used to make these wicked ass arcade games?
59 minutes left for bronycon doc funding
>implying Crapcom doesn't make you cringe
OH SHT I'M MISSING AVGN>
dat Winslow
and Blizzard is lolalwaysonDRM
11,01EA is one. See a game with their logo an expect something bad.
RARE made some of the most terrible Movie Licences games in the NES Area...
classic Nittany_Discord EA rage
Nittany_Discord: I got an exception in my DS :$
i wonder is there is a user created game for The Room
11,01It's true.

EXTREEEEMEEEE GAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!

You don't need to know anything to break mint :<

It is so easy > I broke Mint 12 because update mixing
11,01So. AVGN hates bad ending. So how badly would he react to ME3's ending?
03anyway um
it isn't
11,01*endings
and no midi support out of the box :}
bronycon fundraiser is experiencing a bit of a surge :D

Nittany_Discord: IKR

Steam just told me BMN is starting.... i lol'd :D

i don't know
11,01So LJN is the EA of the past Lil_B?

I wonder what the angry video game nerd in the future would say about these games now~
but i don't want
11,01Or Activision?

Doesn't audacity read .mp4 files?
Why not both?~

Thank you Derpy.
11,01"You need $15 to play this mission? What a load of ass!"
iammrcrap, no nonpic link during stream
sorry:'(
alexxm: still studying but fine. and urs?
Nittany_Discord kinda, Nintendo had a policity at the time, that allowed a Publisher to only release 3 games per years on the NES, LJN Itself was just a doughter company by THQ, so they could push out more then 3 games...
piclinks are ok? what is this linkist diatrod? :P
hm?
i'm good Onyxia what are you studying for
spaggetti zone... :D
03either mplayer or ffmpeg
11,01So LJN got shitty games put on them on purpose?

ok XD
alexxm: thx
Oh this game too D:
this is just my opinion, but i dont think action fighting games didnt really get good until snes gen
the fuck?
String_Shredder: about $20 a month, but you get exclusive videos, Hats for your avatar, and other stuff.
>Wolverine
Nittany_Discord nope, I remembered something incorrectly, LJN was its own company during the NES era, and they really just made shitty games (or rather the people who developed for the), the founder of LJN later also founded THQ
>Claws drain health
why would they do that
WAT
/me shots a pillow~ "Ow my leg~"

Bubble buddy~
Tovler: isn't gold like, 60$ a year?
fucking bubbles
Nittany_Discord: maybe. but how else would a $500 console be sold?
11,01Tovler: Advertising.
11,01And knowing Microsoft, they'll only give a month or three of Gold or whatever free.
Are you guys talking about Playstation 3?
i think they are talking about xbox...just guessing.
11,01And maybe they'll unlock the anti-used games tech if you pay for gold. ;p

((Ironically me and my friend say it all the time by complete accident.))
Watch Dogs was the only interesting thing during the whole of E3...
fuuuuuuuuu i;m not getting any video and i refreshed like 3 times!!!
((As in without knowing it came from the Xmen arcade game.))
GAME TRIVIA: X-MAN had a 5th "Secret" Level with Magneto, after you beat all levels, you have to press a secret code ( I think a+b+select+start), which stands on the backside of the Cartradge, and THEY MESSED IT UP "+A, +B, together with start)... and the end screen... plain text
good graphics? ok
14o.o
LOL!
what
Its a bit sad that Ubisoft won all of e3.
* an the NES Game "X-AMn"
03LOL what indeed
03also >Norway :P
how the hell does that work
OH GOD
genisisi
I lost my enthusiasm for new games a while ago. No real innovation, or new gaming experience, just more rehashed content and graphics... I tend to prefer playing decade old games than the new ones.
lol
alexxm: they tell you to hit the reset button in a cutscene
11,01Is there a Gala level with a playable Magneto?
Mega Drives... problem solved
Genesisisisisisis
Alchemist: Watch Dogs looks interesting xD
also >europe
Tovler: I dunno if it's sad, persay
At the Gala, with magneto
Tovler: To their credit, they showed some GOOD games for one.
*once
YOU FUCKING WOULD OM
03also LOL spelling "genius" wrong

11,01Bronysith: Yes, and on stream.
I beat bubble bobble!
Nittany_Discord: the prison level...my god they are geniuses
That presentation felt unscripted, but w/e. /me looks for old Aisha Tyler Talk Soup clips.
BronySith you know that funny pic related to the prison level of Amnesia?
User0 what ending did you get
11,01Amnesia is boring. I haven't finished it.
Alchemist: yea.
alexxm: true ending
Alchemist: lets play tf2 instead lol
i beat bubble bobble once, you have to finish the second ending with 2 players
it pretty much describes what I did :D
these games were for true autists
IS THIS THE AVGN?
yup.
YAAAAAAAAAAY!
these casuals nowadays don't know shit
damn he was smart as a id
i never did like casual gamers :P
define "casual"
especially the ones who tell me what games they dont like
alexxm: I was at a tech camp and my suite instructor dude had bubble bobble - me and my friend beat it in 3 nights.
No one gets the whip
derpy
AVGN fights fair
ah was it good i never played it myself User0
derpy for president!
what is this anyway?
to me, a casual gamer is someone who goes 'whats that?' when i ask them about a game that's not for any nintendo console
is somebody streaming?
AVGN's first reviews
pre 1990 videogames
Oh wow
alexxm: It was fantastic - another popular game was tetris (We would start screaming and cheering at 3am for tetrises)
LAWL
User0: i love tetris
I like the AVGN
