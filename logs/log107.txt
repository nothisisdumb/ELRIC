Decap, bon Bon knows that very same wizardry :D
Let me guess, Greg.
13Lol Decap
Then she calls you an asshole and gives you the permission for the MRI
Which comes up clean.
I think one of the talents all background ponies have is to be in multiple places at once
but first
Then you get a bone marrow biopsy and she has cancer.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-aww-thanks-fluttershy.jpg
*SHE HATES YOU, DEAL WITH IT.*
Then you pump her full off chemo
MY GUESS: They both die, and are buried next to each other. Or they live, which is mundane.
And watch her die, in which you talk to Wilson and have a "House moment" in which you give her steroids against a bacterial infection
was that WoW on that screen just then? XD

PICTURE SPAMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's not a cure, it's a diagnosis.
still too early
13He said about Dr Whoof in size
It's Herpes.
Check his urine, you'll see I'm right.
Oh...well he DOES have a female persona...
erhem... fictional charecter
I may need to rethink the gender based equations....
I am not breaking spoilers.
13Erm
I am using deductive reasoning
13He said as a mail, she has the same tail
It is Herpes.
13But a shorter mane with a bit more fluff
it was just a picture of disappointed fluttershy
http://miburl.com/Yh0TNS
herpes makes tumors now?
Herpes Encephalitis.
13You dont think you could convert her to male?
http://miburl.com/jqmWcr
No.
13Decap
But the Herpes is fighting the tumors.
13Y u no find bigger pictures
Which is causing all the cramps.
His body is more or less
Fighting itself.
i can just link the pics from the Poniborru page
Give him some Anti-Biotics and move on to next patient.
I could...but it just doesn't seem right for some reason...(But still do-able) Y'all decide
can I ask how old you are?
16.
out of curiosity
aaah...
=P
Can we move on now.
13Or because of the way she looks
13Lol
I call AppleJack Redneck pony.

IDK why

Hugh Laurie does play the piano.
there a bigger picture
sure does!
13I dont think it would look that weird
Plus I would have to rethink the name
13Besides, you only have to describe it, not draw a picture
LOL
I called it
3I have to draw a picture
3With words
Hmm
13Hmm
Passed Herpes to Wilsons patient.
13Well, I dont think it would do as much to Val if we didnt find a male.

ack! sorry dari
Hey, Dari, Luna

keep forgetting that I actually prefer to say series. I tend to use 'season' for american shows and 'series' for uk shows
No
FFFFFFF-
We're busy seeing if I'm right.
3JK
Ahh.
wikipedia's a wonderful tool
I just learned I have a 100mbit up/down connection probably till tomorrow evening
Wikipedia is for people without actual knowledge.
(it'll be throttled down to 10/10 on Thursday)
fine
Just emotionally crush
13Herospirit, we are talking about ValxWrek for now
I could probably make a script to open 50-60 tabs of the stream to see how things handle it.
i was talking abou tthat fic

13It still says "Waitress"
call
LOLOOLO
Hey Val, Daz, Thunder. I'm here for my House
Actually if I connect a GBic connector with fiber to the one switch I have that supports it, I could probably have a 1Gbit/s connection :p
Let me guess though

Okay, I'm in the loop then lol
"...eventually"
My bet is Herpes Encaphilitis.
13Eh, sorry Denied. Just trying to throw ideas out there
Wat; wat happen
I was watching house. :0
2,14 see ya allis
bb
bye allis
bah bah
He is not complex.
someone set up us the bomb
Maybe if it was Wrok.
3I could make his name "Reckless"
:0
orlynao
explain DuspenDe
that would do
And predictable.
predictable, yes
Elaborate on how he is complex.
i didn't mean from just here, in other scenes too :P
good vid, DuspenDe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fRvqR2tPzk

House needs to get back on Methadone.
heh
my suggestion, Decapitation Maker
"pwnies name"?

YESS.

FUCK YES...
/me gives Luna socks
I knew it.
Put them on Dr-Luna
also, thanks for the early spoil, DuspenDe. Really fun... [/sarcasm]
RAAAPE
Well that's cheating.
although, it's not as good as the Pulpfiction one..
Let's watch him prove herpes.
Yes.
But I did not, lol.
LOL
Give us proof of it, DuspenDe.
Anti-Biotics.
Prove it I did.
I did*
where is the proof that you didn't look the spoilers up?
But WE don't. Try to convince us.
Just because you have no ACTUAL medical knowledge and have to look up diagnosis and cross reference, it doesn't mean everyone has to.
Later.
i prefer to believe you got it, DuspenDe, and congratulations!

buh-byee
This song :/
Scrubs?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
eeeegh
Wait, waht is this?
This is good!
hmm, haven't ever seen this :P i only hear good things 'bout it
2,14 >mfw I've never seen scrubs
oh
the show DOESN'T start well.
I've never seen scrubs either
Never watched Scrubs ever
It's the first episode, though. I've never seen this episode~
It's one of those things where most people like it.
Like Friends. >_>
MFW I dislike both
XD
But then Hipsters are all like: Too mainstream
2,14 I enjoyed Friends when I was younger, but looking back on it...meh...'
dari, I don't think I'm gonna be part of the "like" group. Why? Because the main character looks like an idiot in the first 60 seconds of the episode. Aka, HORRIBLE first impression.
The theme song annoyed me when I was younger
Though I can see where you wouldn't like it.
HAI SCRUBS!
I:[
okaaaay...
2,14 I'm just waiting until I see the clip that is in Ponies Anthology :P
yeah, not gonna lie, I don't really like it either
Except for I.T. crowd
Everyone likes I.T. crowd
LOL
...
07at this speed... we're soon running out of IT Crowd :(
D:
:(
07Taking idea's though for a replacement
2,14 there are plenty of other shows out there :P
I have good IT Crowd replacement in mind
07do tell?
Spaced
:D
Reaver21, pose?
I agree with Payne.
I.T. Crowd?
And, Daz, yes.
thx
I've only seen a couple episodes of Spaced, but they were good
very good
soooooo
Erm
Dat talking
YESH, the janitor
Well
I guess
XD
2,14 hmm....is the stream lagging for anyone else?
not for me

It was before, but not for a while
Well start thinkin

Similar to Dr. Perry Cox (though it makes more sense in the comedy setting of Scrubs)
/me feels this fails even as a comedy
2,14 que the "im awesome" song
oh hey
Hi Škoda!
"I'm awesome"
:3

/me is awesome
ooookaaaaay..

ponies can make many things awesome
2,14 hello silvermane
whassap?
okaaay...
/me is awesome
@sexymeter Silvermane

/me is awesome as well
I think I'm traumatized by the inherent boring comedy/stupidity that Scrubs is filled to the brim with.
yes I did, Silvermane.
2,14 crack out dat cello
14lol <3
Dari silently dislikes it
Because it made me cry for gallons of Brain Bleach.
Škoda, you are awesome no need for sarcasism
xD
Brb
A'ight
2,14 when in doubt, just guess me as apparently I hate everything :P
No u don't
Alright, Val hates it slightly less than Derm, if I had to guess :p

You really do have to watch the whole series to get Scrubs
14XD
Play some pony vids =3
Silvermane, the first sixty seconds of the show made the main character look like an idiot! (the bad kind of idiot)
yeah!
http://i.neoseeker.com/mgv/574321-Liege/321/105/11098_spiderman_crossover_fluttershy_macro_spider_man_spiderman_spiderman_is_a_pony_display.jpg

He was an EVERYTHING buddy.

Mostly sex.

did he died?
Don't do kids, drugs
O_O

Also...I think Homestuck has vague pony ref's
i read Harry Potter in 4th grade, and I was reading book 4 in 6th grade.
Shakespeare's actor is excellent.
his moustache twiches when he writes.
Shakespeare's writing was pretty raunchy and filled with innuendo, too.

And Denied_Existence, I wish Homestuck had Pony references, but at least the first 3 Acts came out before Ponies :p

No problem.

2,14 and then drank some bleach to forget it

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU VAL!
Val, you'll never like a fanfic because you have fundamentally decided not to. :P
And for that we thank you.
Mmm. I think that's at least part of it Val. :P
2,14 I weighed it as I would any published work. And it met every one of my expectations
Which were how low, exactly?
Dat countdown...
2,14 actually, they were not as low as you'd think
The singer's hair is going to eat us all
oh, excellent then.
I assume you found it okay then?
(I mean just "okay")
2,14 but deeper analysis of character development/plot structure and even the author's intention with said novel makes it nothing above even the average literary work
Well, you still only read the first 5 chapters
ya
not much text to evaluate the character development/plot structure obn

no
If you want to see it like that
it is a polished turd
but yeah, it is a grail made of turd
but it is still a grail
2,14 my point is this is why I disprove of fanfics. Because even the best of it is not worth my time
2,14 amongst several hobos perhaps
EWWWW.
2,14 yet never recognized by any actual museum
and ignore
2,14 and that's the second reason

me either
inb4 preachiness
2,14 EqD is a blog about fanfics
2,14 which in the literary world is the equivalent of (at best) a cult
EQD is a blog about Ponies, including fanfics
That's why I said it was the centerpiece of the EqD museum
EqD is a blog about Ponies :p
2,14 I like watching My Little Pony. I am not any member of a cult
lolwut. freeze?
and again a second later?
You said you aren't a member of the cult
0What are we arguing about, and is it really that important?
He meant the cult being fanficers actually
we are a cult!
Eh
I don't agree with him, but don't twist his words :p

Okay. Odd show...
2,14 also derma I never said all other fanons are awful...
well, YOU JUST DID
Jonathon Creek has mindblowing realisations in this show.
2,14 *sigh* once again. FANFICS=/= FANON
Greater than House realisations, which is saying something.
:P
<ValtheJean>: I dislike them because they are _awful_ fanon
Soooo, is it a murder mystery show?
2,14 yeah, and I was refering to fanfics
>all fanfics are awful
>dislike them because they are awful
Sense much make?
2,14 To be fair, I hold nothing of derpy/dinky's personality a part of fanon, only their relationship
2,14 further more (and again) I highly doubt that derma
disliking awful things makes sense, but them being awful due to disliking doesn't
well, saying you don't like something because of a subjective point is saying Pineapples taste bad because I hate them
Val, you's gettin ganged up on
2,14 honestly I don't mind that, I just wish my words weren't being misinterpretted >.<
Herospirit Now I must attempt to decide if the trolls are supposed to relate to something...
i gave up watching the show on the stream, and just went back to my metal
Talking about Homestuck, before anyone asks :P
Val, you hate all fanfics, you hate them because they are bad fanon, why are they bad fanon, because all fanfics are inherently bad.
Sense make much?
2,14 see, now you're twisting my words
makes none to me
:P
2,14 no, that's just how you chose to construct them :P
2,14 fanfics are bad fanon BECAUSE of a lack of any substantial quality
2,14 they are literally without merit
I have no clue...just speculating for some reason
I suspect that we have met the detective of this show.
Now I could illegitimise my whole arguement here.
And I really want to.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498

Here we go.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
DecapKing, stop it.
You're spamming.
Fanfiction is properly justified as a legitimate source of speculation of characterization and entertaining extremities.
2,14 legitimate how?
that*
2,14 to be fair dari, you missed an important part :P
actually, dari hasn't illegimized his argument. He basically explained the WHOLE FUCKING ISSUE in four lines.
And I thank you GREATLY for that.
2,14 and then the offer for me to read FO:E, the supposed example of a good fanfic was offered
2,14 superfluous offer much? oiy...
2,14 I think this is a fair way to leave this conversation:
FO:E was pretty good. Actually written like a book.
honestly, in mathematics a single point does not a function prove
Val, if fanon isn't all bad, why is fanfiction all bad? Is it just a massive coincidence that only the bad fanons get written down?
Good is subjective.
:P
read that
Bamn, headshot
LOL
2,14 well then that completely nullifies the entire point of the discussion dari
Dem police
In fact, I still need to read that
/me thinks that crossovers and Adventure-fics are bad ways to indoctrinate into fanfic enjoyment
2,14 because if we're dealing in matters of the subjective, then there IS no good or bad, and as such both parties are incorrect
Don't want to make a scene in the cinema while people are watching a film.
2,14 herospirit: because I've seen good fanon, and I have not seen good fanfiction
but I mean
Oooooooh, I want this theory too...I must catalogue it in my files on psychology.
Er...cause...you know...keeping files is entirely normal.
Well it is irrational to assume that all fanfics are bad, because it is near impossible that there's not a single one in existence that you wouldn't enjoy.

2,14 it's as irrational to assume there IS one I would enjoy :P
2,14 considering the very nature of a fanfic frustrates me

Wait... let me get this straight. You are arguing that fanfics are bad-- all bad-- by virtue of BEING fanfics?
/me FOR FUCKS SAKE DROP IT ALL OF YOU
And why do they frustrate you?
14I MAD!
Herospirit, don't start.
I apologize.
2,14 but, seeing as how this is frustrating silvermane, I suggest we leave this discussion for a time he is not online
this argument, making me homicidal
Really, no sarcasm, I actually apologize. I should've dropped this a while ago.
alright then
I see a murder coming up.
The easiest murder ever :P
No, I do these calculations myself
But... you can't calculate infinite time.
Did you guys know that the likelihood of people creating proper aspect ratio wallpapers is 0%? :(
Although it does involve a lot of guesswork.
herospirit No, but I can allow for it.
Actually, you can calculate for infinite time. It just takes really really long.\
Damn you Denied. :p
Wut
OKay-- anyone that clueless HAS to be a great detective.

*in to charge
^ Happens to my mouse all the time x.x
Although, I suppose you could take into account the likeliness that an afterlife or re-incarnation exists...but those calculations are WAY too wild for me

Want any more calculations?
brb
My brain is just warming up!
I dunno my favorite. Maybe Twilight. Possibly Fluttershy.
Denied, never tell me the odds!
But the odds are cool....
Come on! Give me something to calculate! I dare you!
back
REMEMBER: If the odds are ever exactly one in a million, then it is guarenteed to happen!
Because this is the first episode it's longer than they normally are.
That cursor was picking her nose...
And is therefore a bit slower.
Silvermane Only if you are basing it upon a finite time period.

Silvermane Oh, well in narration that does tend to be a cliché
:D HE GOT IT
I AM WINNER.
XD
:D
OHOHOHO
2,14if you set a city on fire...it's fucking hillarious
Mimes are to be imprisoned in a pit full of scorpions and a sign, reading "Learn the Words"
~yay~
rape implies not wanting it
Silvermane has a point
Well that would really depend...
(legally it implies much more than that, but it's funnier this way)
unless one person is underaged
bah statutory. long discussion, not worth the time for now
Help, help! I need an adult!
I am an adult
...
well.
I was saying my depend in relation to Decap's post
what're we watchin
wtf is this show even about?
I ASKED FIRST D:<
that depends if you like it herospirit
0% and 100%
6I ASKED WITH COLOR
You also asked first...

Give me the answer to both

Incoming Jonathon Creek epic
6PINK SQUARE
6Nope.
Eeeeeeeeyup
6Just because a thought is in my brain doesn't mean I care.
HOW DID HE DO IT?!
Then he explains it.
And ruins the moment.
You can argue logic all you want, but you still thought about it for a finite amount of time. And even if you don't care now, you cared enough to ask wether you cared or not.
FUCKING MAGNETS
And therefore you cared.
Also, that thought about caring or not extends backwards to near infinity
He is the greetest.
wtf is this show about?
Wait wut
I must away
why does that sound familiar?
>artificially inseminated with a trolley
The lines in this show.

HOW DID SHE DO IT?!
TELL ME!
His parents live in Phillydelphia
i think its spelled Fillydelphia
I think you may be correct Val, but reaching 100% requires some more calculations...give me a second and I can figure out whether it was .00001% more than you thought.
2,14 I see, my thanks denied :P
Hey, even a tiny bit between 99 and 100% is a whole lot.
Jonthaon.
You're a genius
DUN DUN DUN
how long is this show?
And here's the twist...
Normally 1 hour episodes.
this episode's an hour and a half, i dunno how far in we are
Not sure.

>Correction: Egyption fursuit rape scene.
And this ISN'T in Las Vegas?
I KNEW that would happen
I predicted it about an hour ago...
Woah, boggling my mind here.
:P
Here comes the epic explanation
He was like WTF!?
AndHereWeGo.jpg
WTF?
YFW Jonathon's first brilliant explanation was just the warm up.
We expect you to say: "I am guilty"
14I think Decap is stalking me. D:
This is the main course.
Now.
There is just one thing to say for that explanation.
nah
........?
that's some epic deduction right there
2,14 rofl dari
And his timing is appalling..
Or if you prefer equation style: S^2
don't do it man.

Wait...so I ALREADY MISSED IT!?

night dari
haha Val, same here, I had a bunch of unfinished work I was supposed to do over summer and I barely did any
2,14 I suppose since there's no stream, and CERTAIN people are off playing WoW...I might as well do it now
'Night Val
2,14 good night all, make sure to post ponies while I'm gone :P
I'm going too. Goodnight.
ALSO, FEAR NOT, FOR VAL FICTION IS IN THE WORKINGS
XD
*EVILLAUGH*
Hi Decap
Me
Yes
Or are you hoping to avoid the swarms that that would release upon you?
speaking of which, is there going to be a stream of S1 before S2? I remember someone asking that during... I think the first LoTR movie
Wouldn't bother me at all. *Note: I'm not actually in charge of anything around here. I just lurk all the time.*
I had guessed that might be the case. :P
It seemed awfully convenient.
And are they currently online?
How would I go about contacting them?
Well, they are currently listed as being in the channel.
14Dashite isnt in charge of this place. :P
I know, but if he lurks here, he might be of SOME use
Dari
Dari
Dari
Dari
14As for mentioning it over on pony, thats fine.
Oh, I mean in a sticky
Hi Decap
14You mean its own sticky?
sort of
edit in the link into the existing sticky in pony
6...what's going on now?
You're in charge of this?
14I thought we already had a link in the existing thread.
6Yes.
14Its a group effort. lol
14Well, I like to think of it as a group effort still.
6One moment.
whats going on?
6I have no problem with it. If something comes up where the other admins disagree, which I doubt, I'll make sure to contact you to ask to take it down.
6Though again, I doubt that'll happen.
14Hmm...
okay, my main concern is that you might not be able to take the full load that that would bring upon you
I don't know anything about how this is all set up, mind you
I probably should have set my name as something useful. ._.
AKA DecapMan, xxHeadremoverxx, etc
Hello there
nifty
6But yeah, I have no problem with it, and would appreciate it, and see no reason the other admins would have issue with it either, since we'd only be pushing for it at a later date anyway.
6Go for it.
any other info you would like me to add?
*soul
6We'll be streaming the episodes live as they come out.
probally whenever the episodes come on
14I said that already, but y'know...
or whenever it comes on
14When they first air.
It never hurts to confirm anything
14We're streaming that 8am or such one right?
14I think it plays twice that day.
6Whatever time it is, yes.
14On the 17th.
6Again, everything live as it comes out.
alrighty then
I'll go start on that
6np
6Thanks for checking with us.
You're welcome. :)

You are welcome

Hey, someone had to keep him company until you mods showed up!

14Well, people ignore me anyway. lol

That wasn't implying any such thing. :/

It was several months ago.

Any particular reason?
10just meh
I find the place to be alright
Lol, I don't like it either.
10meh in its entirety
It's full of drama.
That's all I'm saying.
10I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
10it's not my scene
10and sooo many people take ponychan SOOO seriously
>come back >Gurren XLR.
ya i pretty much just think the place is alright.. i used to like it alot but i don't go there much anymore and don't find much to do there atm

And DAT WALLPAPER
I agree, its awesome
Well, a ton of people are complete asshats. You'll find then everywhere.
ya basically.. but even nice people i sometimes don't like hanging around simply cause i don't have the same interests
also, i downloaded 'best of pony music vol. 1' gonna listen to it later :P
muahaahah
It's interesting when people are different.
Hey Daz
People good at different things, they like different things.

MeteorVenture, you explained it fine. 'pretty limited way fo thinking' says it all
alright well thanks!
and take care synros:D
k
Sorry Daz, someone walked in to discuss something with me
I'd never do that. The mods here are awesome
alright lol.. what's the movie?
inception?
MeteorVenture 'havne't seen before' :P. Inception was movie night, and even then i had seen it. nah, it's called '500 dayso f summer '
orly? ok well i didn't watch that here.. i saw that recently though and it's awesome
but never seen 500 DOS either
hahaha, 500 DOS xD
:P it wasn't actually intentional this time
still, good job, MeteorVenture
thanks lol
haha
was it you?
:P
Alright, gonna be afk. Working on permissions on my shares
(market being android's 'appstore')
i have fluttershy brushable, and today i'm either gonna get blindbags or rainbwodash brushable :3
i have no toys ;_;
i live in a trailer with no pony toys ;_;
If I were him I'd probably feel the same.
He's from Iran.
Where religion is forced on you and if you don't like it you get executed.
Yeah.
and, my point wasn't 'you must do relition' it was 'if you don't like it leave it alone, not hate it : /'
religion *
10it's pointless to even discuss religion
My point is that he has reason to hate religion.
And I don't blame him.
what's his reason Dari?
I told you?
dat juiciness
Well he hates that one in particular, but the rest he thinks are just bullshit anyway.
hmm, that's fine. of course he has reason to hate that one, and if he thinks others are garbage (dat americanism), it's his opinion.
Ya, i'm feeling lazy, i cba to carry on arguing today
*yawn*
aww.. i was gonna talk in depth about it with you too
aha
ok, i'll try. shoot, MeteorVenture
i was gonna wait for the movie to end though lol
nah, dual screen, man!
Well, whatever you want ^_^
So...quite the CMC FiM episodes for tomorrow, huh

All right.
10pretty lulzy though
They did kind of take it out of context
[14:30] <RainBroDash> I can't explain it, but it's just the whole imageboard mentality and the type of crowd imageboards attract
[14:30] <RainBroDash> it's not my scene
10I don't really care to be honest, context or not it was accurate to a point
I hate imageboards.
'nuff said.
/me still wonders what's going on
10That's why I had to post personally, to make sure people knew why I said it

Yeah, little oversight on my part. No matter, I can do it again
File server
Unix based?
It's not that bad!
I honestly didn't want to overhaul everything, just make things more manageable and faster
I know, I know
is okay
but honestly
i would choose Mac over anything else
once
I made it my two week misson
There's a pony for everything on Mac!
yes
there is
?
YES okay :D
Also much easier to actually get shit working
i LOVED aero's design
Because Mac OSX on dual boot on my W7 is. . .
les easy~
Vista was bad and they should feel bad
my current iMac was the best of it's line in 2006
My assistant is a macfag
But he's not a brainless fanboy like some of the others
OH MY WORD
I'm kind of a fag for Open Source. :P
IF I BOUGHT A MAC IT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
OH MY WORD
YES
IT WOULD
BECAUSE MAC HARDWARE IS THE BEST HARDWARE
MY MAC WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
and it would be even faster if you had a SSD installed
and YES IT WOULD
lol yelling
Haha
It's because they usually speak in yells

Ubuntu boots in 10 seconds flat, for me.

Well you'll see.
The irc has changed.

Yeah, no one has registered nicks right now.
Just bandwidth use.
I think we need more
Hmm
We may be switching here if it can take the strain.
Or just a different bigger IRC server.
That doesn't cap our room limit like epic-chat seems to be doing.
Yeah, gunna use it for movie night.
IRC isn't all that traffic intensive.
It is when you have 4000+ people.
:>
Yeah I don't think I can simulate 4000 tabs
XD
I can but that would involve a few hours of work that I don't think I can put forth :(
We're using this server for movie night.
hope it goes well :P
Then I'll estimate from my bandwidth usage during that time how many people this server can take.
Yeah.
I could write a script to open 4000 tabs, maybe... assuming the IRC client supports it.
is it all set up already now?
Services are up, yes.
and mib_o7u8re mibbit only lets you have 4 I think
We have memoserv, hostserv, botsev.
ChanServ and NickServ of course.
I wrote a script to flood IRC ;D

savestating is the way to play Fester's Quest, really
I don't think there is, RP.
Well, then we'll just have to wait and see, I guess.
liez
Till after BMN at least.
it's hidden
aaaaah
Most of the users in the other channel are AFK.
Dinkypage still seems to be on the other IRC
It's not.
Should do a +m and just leave a message
I think that's a good plan
You know which games do require alot of savestating?
The Gheb FE hacks
There are still people talking in there :P
Well, akick is something different.
But meh.
I'll call it akick anyway.
Whatever you think is right :P
akick and not aboot?
06hmm

Oh cool, I think I'm finally back
*ear worem
*WORM
I can't type, even though I am very good at spelling...
I was humming "Proud to be a Brony" all day at work.
Cyall!
07Pinkie!
07*hugs*
/me hugs Luna
07yay
07how are you?
07looking forward to 4 eps of house?
I didnt know grammar could kill a chatroom.
2,14 I would be looking forward to house...if I didn't have classes during them :(
2,14 how'd it go?
and yes, I am very much looking forward to that, especially since I fell asleep during the 3rd episode last night
07today we wrap season 2 up :)
/me 2,14 cries
07poor val
Season wrap u[p, Season wrap up~~~
2,14 lol grats pinkie, you're a step above me ;)
2,14 Sathi, all my <3
2,14 all of it
Hi guys! Whats goin on?
I doubt everyone's seen it thus far, but we'll see in... about 5 hours?
07Season wrap-up, Season wrap-up
2,14 let's finish our medical cheer
07House + IT crowd today and maybe 1 ep of a random cartoon
seriously?
Oh it's "for"
hey madponyking
why do we only watch IT crowd and house?
07cause House is awesome
because... they're awesome shows. :P
Oh. I see
But whys should we stick with only them?
07people like House
07I like House
07= win
damn straight!
07People like IT crowd
I'd vote for some more Freakazoid, too :3
2,14 You can't argue with that logic :P
Once all the IT crowd has been gone through, we could maybe continue with Spaced, like I suggested yesterday?
07No Spaced available.. I looked for it today
07any other suggestions?
how about Heroes?
07I was thinking about Bones, NCIS or CSI
Damn. It's available through the "other" method.
2,14 G3! *Trollface*
07lol
NO!
G3.5 :3
why not just G4?
Well the voice of pinkie pie is in the G3.5 somewhere
No G4 eps outside BMN... until S2, anyway
0And then there were two. . .
awww...
It's gunna take a while.
sometimes people set up synchtube rooms though, not sure if that's frowned upon or something
LICD?
2,14 Least I Could Do
2,14 wubs Bwack Boks! /)^3^(\
oh okay
shit man. fucking time zones, how do they work?
07I normally start my streaming around 3:30 PM Eastern
0714 mins CaJ
in other words, 2 hours?
07yes
oh that cod.
>that
Haha, thank you. :)
Oh
oh thank cod*
But hey, got my Luna t-shirt done. Now I can proudly display my Bronydom in open.
one sec
Me too, or at least the image it's based on :3
http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9545/img1265h.jpg
because seriously they all suck
Hope the link works
Thanks! I made that myself.
DAT SHIRT
Oooooh, nice
Made the design myself influenced by MegaSweets wallpapers
<3
It's beautiful~
Why thank you.
What'd you use on the shirt to get it that way?
it's really great
07So guys
?
07NCIS / CSI / Bones or something else?
I like CSI...
Which CSI?
CSI: MIAMI
I'd go with Miami too.
/me is checking
But this is only after we run out of IT crowd right?
This is such an awesome song... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
CSI, lol
07trying the "other"way
Crime Scene Yngwiemalmsteengations
Why csi? why not Law & Order?
it looks like Miami...
07Alright guys back in a bit
...
I wouldn't mind Law & Order, either, really...
Do whichever you need Luna~
07CAJ PM
I know this has nothing to do with anything... But have you guys watched this shit: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=BFa&list=FLmANqFFCiTCLrlhgnhKlZng&index=10
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA" - "MWYAAAH"
HAHA
Oh wow, that is special right there
JUST TO GET IT ALL OFF WHAT'S IN MY HEAD
AND II II II III~
Well the actual song it's based on is awesome
4 Non Blondes
lol
My parents have their 8-track tape.
:3
07How did you hear about us?
MYAAAH!
that would be on a ponychan thread
07When?
it was for the first one actually
cod, I don't think I'd know without a list or something... it's been a bunch though
HEY! I just had an awesome idea!
Why dont we watch Adventure Time?!
whats that?
I
07Take a wild guess?
A tv show suposedly for kids like my little pony.
I would estimate at least like... ten? maybe
That is an idea I can get behind
Its epicly awesome!
07Alright
Adventure Time is awesome
lol
07What role did you apply for?
I have all episodes.
If I could stream I would.
yeah give it a go
but don't tell Dari
He hates it c.c
moderator
>_>
seriously?
Because it sucks.
07Do you have any experience with moderating?
awww man
D:
DON'T KILL ME DARI
SPARE ME
It's actually pretty creepy to be honest. :P
Or at least my kitten. . .
OOH KITTENS
Haha, oh okay
TASTY!
Omnomnomnomnom
Creepy?
Well I guess that idea's shot down then. :P
07How many viewers did the show have?
awww...
I streamed a couple episodes by request one time.
Half the people found it weird / creepy like me and half liked it.
hmm... let me think
07Sure
For tv
It originated in the US on TV. . .
oh ok
Well, FiM is loved by everyone here, though :P
Sure is!
You don't even know . . .
FiM is EVERYTHING here
/me is in Germany
See? That's just heresy.
IIRC it was anywhere between 50-200 viewers...? a pretty rough estimate, but it should be pretty accurate
Oooh, nice.
She just wants a bit of the flank. . . <3
Hai Luna
Of course eveyone here loves it.
lol
ohay DecapKing
Hi Decap!
inb4 "Who?"
pretty much any weekday after 1, most weekends
where?
sorry everyone, forgot I got disco'd from this chatroom when the IRC switching happened
maybe one or the other though
06aye
Of course I realize I just said "several" and you're talking about all of Finland
idk where Sweden even is lol
no wait
06yeah
i remember
06convod 3 of em myself
its next to norway right?
06the otehr 2 the otehrs
Swede is below Norway, next to Finland
Sweden*
07What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
Sweden is to the right of Norway :P
06not below
07np
OMG
I beg to differ RP
WHERE IS THE STREAM?!?!?!??!?!?!?!
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png/276px-Finland-CIA_WFB_Map.png
I'd say its more popular in France tho.
07starting in 90 mind
07mins*
well i dont really know
well i knew that sweden was next to Russia
It's popular in France, Germany, and UK
cause i know alot about the motherland
just a fact that they cant speak english for shit here
The stream is IN Russia
... shit, man
<- from Russia
My knowlege of FIM's popularity depends on EqD news.
Well yes, you're right RP
it kind of spoons Sweden
<3
I know I shouldn't...but that made me Lol
06<3
like... skills as a mod or just... skills
07:P
07the shit, man thing?
Become one with Russia.
Lolwut
yeah
That doesn't seem the best thing to say in an interview.
^ Yes
its taught in most school systems in the world
and no
weel
*well
a good amount
07dat answer
You dont HAVE to. But it helps
...
Wut
i know
A-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Oh okay
Let's put it this way. . .
06sho dari, you have a config to mkae :P
XD
and you're talking to someone
07Any other skills you have?
Type english unless otherwise noted
Learned that the first time. . .
most people i know in france just have an inability to learn english
06^
it isnt really needed, you can just translate most things
but I am frequently singing along to things I listen to, sometimes to the dismay of others
I'm Deutsch WP XD;
I have friends in Finland
and family that moved there
but I was born in Austria
/me begins rambling in swedish, SKÅL!
do you live in Berlin?
Oh ok.
I sorta thought only Finnish would have several Finnish friends.
and then moved here to Dresden, Saxony, Germany
07dat answer
Waarom moet ik Engels spreken? :(
I think that's going to be the slogan of this interview :P
but i live in the US
Wow.
"dat answer"
I visited Berlin last year. That city is awesome!
/me just found CSI miama S1
07Miami*
Y U NO STREAM ARCHER?
mostly because I like to be sarcastic, I guess
Because my parents thought it'd be beneficial if I ever go anywhere outside of Europe
06So far i feel hesitant
Or IN Europe even .~.
go to RUssia
07oh lol...
06:|
shall I make a "dat answer" meme now? :P
I work as a secretary and during my interview English was one of the key reasons I got the job.
07sure
Luna doesn't approve of my dutch... probably because I'm 10 years out of practise. :(
06where was dat answer, when the interview took place?
dose it pay well?
07Any other ideas?
they have two pages with like 5,000 and 8,000 likes
That's a bit personal...
not unless you haven't been on EqD already
Hai Dari, WHERE IS THE STREAM?!??!?!?!?!
07Well, she doesn't have to answer
07it's her personal choice
maybe an advert in celestia radio
yep
I'm setting shit up DecapKing. :P
In a word, yes.
Luna: Yeah, but it's just one of those things you don't ask, like a woman's age. :P
Well, here it is anyway.
Germans aren't usually very good at English, no offence :P
Though I live in the civil land of Britainland.
:P
Or weight
Dari where you busy looting?
07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
oh shit! I gotta go! Bye guys! Have a nice stream!
inb4 dat answer :P
bai madponyking
cya
07those answers
basically
07so much fail...
In Sweden only children's shows/movies get dubbed.
06ok the file's in the folder
^Same in Finland
07Any other motivations?
Meine Mutter ist Englisch-Lehrerin
Oshit Conan's on TV
06the majority is very fluetn in english, for sweden that is
;A;
^Same
07Dari are you streaming tonight?
lol even children's movies have both dubbed and subtitled versions in the theatres.
not even a real reason, just a perk, I guess
I usually stream whenever you finish.
And somtimes before you start.
sometimes*
Except Finns can't pronounce properly anything
06*dat asnwer*
07Ah ok I was planning to go live in 90 mins
In English that is
07Do you have any previous IRC experience?
lol
Of earlier this year.
XD
Man, Helsinki is such a nice city. I can't wait to go back sometime.
Really? I kinda had the idea our Swedish is like unintelligible to Swedish.
I didn't use the commands that often as a mod though, because I usually just right clicked
07At least he's honest
You live there?
That's nice. Goes to show how you souldn't belive everything people say.
Yes, I live in Helsinki.
07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
06agreed
As the great pony #7 once said
That's nice, Hope you have good time.
LET's DO THIS
Hellew
oh cod that was stupid

Last time I visited I wrote an anthem on the piano for my friend.
Yes I read that. That's really nice. It's just I'm finnish and we don't get that kinds of compliments that often.
you don't want to
I go by RobotPika/RobotPinkie everywhere online now.
also http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
that would probably warrant a kick
06nice val
ty :P
06and thank you for getting me to want to know
06sily yo
lol
07:D
07Third image:

That makes it easier to go around, but only if the name is such that no-one else might not use.
Hi Škoda
06val
06now.
lol, I'll pm it to you
not as bad as the second one I guess, because they're not literally on top of each other, but still at the very least, a warning
14Hey guys
I saw two Škoda Octavias today
probably a kick though because actual kissing is involved
:p
Hi Octavia~ :3
I've been using my nick for about an decade now. It's like my other name.
07>mfw a kick for the 3rd picture
06agreed
06a first isnt it?

Fine then, Hai Octi
07Fourth image is down
07One sec
DEM OCTAVES
<3
Nice
07please do

06@drinkablemeter DrPepper
6 DrPepper is 98% drinkable. (1555)
ive been using this for 3 years
I'll see if I can find that as well
/me has no idea where to look for such material
aw, I thought I had more fluids in me than that :(
I am also drinking Dr. Peper
*pepper
07:)
07;)
14:P
They don't sell that here. . . v.v
I never drank Dr. Pepper
07Octa you should see his interview in a bit on the forums :)
found it
Or at least not an shop around here
damn
the image is kinda tiny
but for now it works
07;)
Dr. Pepper I mean
07keep looking
kk, I'll keep looking
14Whatre we looking for exactly atm?
whew
never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually try to upload this image
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
07http://www.ponychan.net/chan/dis/src/131154337367.png
that link works for everyone, right?
06yeah
It's like cola for adults I think
14Ywah
kk
07yes
14*yeah
07dat response
adults drink cola too.
The only cola I drink regularly is Coca-Cola
oh oh wait
I have the meme!
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/DatAnswer.jpg
14lol
I like Mezzo Mix as well.
yeah that's a definite boot to the head
06"boot to the ehad"
06nice
It's hard to describe tastes, I think. :P
Mezzo Mix is awesome
14Naaa naaa
I discovered Mezzo when I visited Berlin
07Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
But I knew of Mezzo Mix before
07Do you have anything to add?
Mezzo is delicious <3
Interestingly we had not had Mezzo when I visited Berlin (That was early last year) and we did not get that drink here.
/me hits "Replay" for the 10th time on "Are You Proud to be a Brony?"
nothing that I think would help me in any way :I
14Got up early and everything and still missed pretty much the entire interview. :P
Yes, I've been to Munich several times
Okay. Good.
alright
:D
thanks for the consideration
I've been thinking of visiting the alps.
ME TOO
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Cockta.jpg/250px-Cockta.jpg
That's it
We shall visit the Swiss Alps together. <3
I go to Austria many times for skiing. It's great
I guess he meant me?
I jelly, I've never been there
XD
lol
Sorry *she
:3 I am a proud Pegasis~
14So which was he again? I dont remember seeing that name in the recruitment forum.
And one of the only in this Bratwürstefest~
I thought it was just all "bronies"
We don't have he/she distinction in finnish language.
07in mIRC that is
14Copy/paste?
That's my excuse.
07yea ;)
14Oooh.
;3 is fine WhatPayne~
>god pun
14Not sure bout mIRC. If it wont let you simply copy it.
Dont hate me ;_;
14Print screen? and crop? Lmao
sehr gut meine freunde ;D
Alright: I posted on the interviews thread with updated links for all the images
since they're tied to my photobucket, they shouldn't be going away any day soon
<3
danke schön
oh oh sathi
bitte sehr
go into tools
then log files
Suddenly, silence. . .
it'll have the entire log saved for you
Wiederbelebungsgetränke, or something of that sort
I feel scared T~T
:P
:P
learning*
14Didnt think about that, but I've never looked back at old convos on mIRC either.
Or verbatim "Resuscitation drinks"
I'm pretty sure that it keeps you from dying when you hit 0 hearts
07Bah :(
:3
yep :P
14Oh, thats why. He goes by "CAJ"
07it looks a bit messy now on the forums
07take a peek
14Little messed.
07yer a little
14:P
Yeah~
Dutch is really weird language.
I don't :p
14Think its retarded mIRC wont just let you copy/paste it.
07WAT?!
07Weird?
I'm a bit Hungary, don't Dutch my Komputer while I'm Norway~
lol, don't tell that to dari :P
14Ugh, he was the attention horse too.
07I agree
Sorry, but I tried to learn some words when I visited Netherlands, and I could not.
Thank you, greetings to you all.
I'll probably only be able to stick around for the first part of this interview
How do you say beer in dutch?
>.<*
14Yay VV
köstlich~ <3
14Greetings
Bier
Not 100% on the spelling...
07Do you have any questions before we start?
I haven't been to the Netherlands in maybe 5-6 years
No, I understand.
Netherlands was nicest country in whole EU I've been in.
jaja
07How did you hear about us?
I'm gonna have to break out my Dutch-Swedish dictionary if you have more questions :P
During my Dutch aunt's birthday there were having a pretty high level discussion in Dutch, and I joined in in English. Fun times.
*they were
14Reading CAJs interviewa a bit right now too... "... shit man" Lmao
Luna where are you from?

:P
07Anything else?
In my personal opinion, it's one of the best sites community wise, and the selection of content is suitable for most ages.

07yea and more
well I always enjoy it, just because people's reactions to it are priceless :P
Oh yeah Sathi.
It was great. XD
We didn't get to see how the epsiodes ended though. :(
Yet still, the machine simply won't take the updated drivers like everyone else, and it's making me mad.
14My memory is fuzzy, remind me. :P
07SOON!
/me hits replay on "Pinkie's Lie" for the 10th time today
14Oooh yeah. That. lol
As far as my abilities go, as aforementioned, I can stream a wide variety of shows. I'm also able to do musical DJing or Radio Shows. One idea I had was to expand the site to include podcasts or group oriented radio shows that would entertain or draw in members weekly. Many members enjoy livestreams for different personalities and that would be a good opening
14Fuek der sea ponies.
/me wonders where the stream is
14They could just shoo be doo their ways out!
How would IT Crowd handle that problem?
I like her answer there
hey everyone
07me too
Oh that's right, when's stream, Luna?
hows it going
she and I could organize music related streams :P
I also think that having a slight heavier member focus as far as content goes would be helpful as well.
hay Synros
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
07could you clarify that?
For Twilight/NMM
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vaF1qZBP3o
14Hey, that was my idea!
Well, that's the Twilight one.
Still sped up audio, lol
14Though I figured since we do movies and shows, that a music stream wouldn't really be our... thing. lol
well might i say, it works
Yeah
Dunno why they all use the sped one
14I didn't mention it in my interview because I didn't think it would get any praise. :P
The sped up one actually fits the RD one, since sped up Offspring's lead singer does sound kinda like Dash.
07a weekly podcast might be cool though
probally to make the videos shorter or to have the higher pitch
>had no idea you were thinking similar things
/me is now offended :P
14But I was apart of Everypony radio for a while and used to music streaming more.
14lol
Yeah probably to make the pitch sound cartoony
14A weekly podcast would be awesome.
AHHHHH
NOT FANFICS
NOT FANFICS!!!!!!!!!
Lawl
14Lmao
:(
it wouldnt sound right with the normal pitch having these clips playing
07I like her ideas
yeah, she's got some good ideas
14Yeah, shes certainly got some nice ideas going.
minus the fanfic readings :P
they have an applejack one with normal speed audio
>mfw you're going to make ME read them out loud as punishment >.<
07Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
Yeah, but it fits Applejack
I dunno about that, most PMVs use normal audio
14Well, some fanfics are alright. lol But I dont know how many people would stick around for it.
The applejack one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMfws-KSYE
Cya then.
14Oh yeah.
07see you later Val
14Laters Val
I GO!
This is the origin of RD, by the way: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIABbOqVWrk
14I really like the idea of a weekly podcast though.
>still buys cds
I occasionally do that.
I still buy CDs too, I like having the lyrics and info in a booklet
There's a few stores where it's cheaper than buying the album on iTunes
...not all that often though
Not even lyin'
i like to have the artwork for the albums
14And yeah, I know. :(
Maybe I should check online before buying CDs...
When I first heard that I song went lol.
I do like being able to just rip everything to every device I have though
and CD lets me do that :P
Buying 'em on iTunes does that, too
it does?
iTunes hasn't had DRM in years.
/me knows she also likes RP
14Aww :P
/me 14isn't much an RPer
I make sure to stay for as long as possible. Only once have I had to leave before the entire event was over.
/me 14now feels left out lol
14Eh, only once had to leave early.
Yup
07hmm
Because then I guess I might buy a lot less CDs :P
It's Apple Lossless Codec, but you can convert that inside iTunes
07so she does stay?
its just personal preferance. No need to argue
We ... aren't arguing
07I see, thank you
stop fight!!! please!
this is madness!!
07That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
lol Synros
07did you voted on CAJ yet?
14Yeah...
14lol
If I had more money, I'd be buying Season 1 in HD right now, actually
14Nope.gif
I am ready.
Season 1 Blu-Ray can't be out already
I dunno, some CDs I'll probably still buy
14Her body is ready!

Unfortunately, I only have 50 bucks, and I need to get some breakfast food for weekends, since the cafeteria on campus doesn't open until 11 on weekends
Srs?
anyone wanna come over and help me? this is getting depressing
Hard copy?
No, iTunes
Eh
I don't iTunes
07Let's see how she handles these
Neither do I.
It's 50 bucks for the HD version of every ep
are iTunes videos also DRM free?
14Yeah, this is the tough part. At least it was for me.
Let me check the file on the free ones I have
14If you've got a different guideline to this like I did that you're used to, it can be difficult.
Me too, even if the artwork would be horrible, I would want to buy the case.
07but you can keep practicing with these
07there's many pony images allover the web
and if it doesn't, I'll just print a custome cover for it :P
But then again, MPC's been being shitty for me.
14Yeah, I'm still trying to wean myself into it.
14I know, you should see my pic archive on my computer. XP
Okay, it does

07We are a super-team we be fine ;)
14:P
14We gonna have it in here or you prefer Skype?
07I think here
07but we'll see
14I wish Skype would work for our conference calls. But then we'd probably just have everyone talking over each other.
Nice. If you have decent inkjet printer and photograph paper, these are quite easy to print yourself.
/me only has a color laser
Might be able to, I just need to get more ink for it :P
I don't get it, gave a verbal warning for the first picture.
She seemed to be on the right track.
But the second picture she just said "Don't post that".
lasers can do good job too. I have no direct experience tho but knowing there is laser photo paper, it should work.
Rather than stating a course of action.
14She might be used to the same type of guidelines I've been.
07:P
14Whats wrong to some isnt wrong to others. :P
Everything alright, Luna?
I wouldn't bother.
14Think I've also been desensitized by /b/ over the years too however. :P

14Yup yup.

Are you aware of Tryponyphobia?
