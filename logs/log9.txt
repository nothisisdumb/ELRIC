OK.
hey Dari whats up
gearing up for another wonderful day of work tommorow lol
you get up nice and early huh
well you were the other day lol...think I fed you about 50 quotes lol
I was falling asleep over my keyboard lol...had to bail out
umm
lol
yeah well the Navy has at least given me the ability to go a long time with dismal sleep
you're telling me man
I never want to
yeah
well I know SR does
lol...would be fun to learn about it someday
ok
well that's interesting
which are?
wtf is that lol
and this is usefull how?
wow lol
give me another example
yeah
wow
and that's helpful how
ohh
wow..where the heck do you guys come up with all these lines of code
?
whats that suppose to be lol
ohhh
yeah I just got that lol
that's strange...so if I wanted to pull that off...I would use that code you gave above?
Hey man I'm just kinda listening right now lol
but someday I might get into it
http://www.bradsbox.info/nub.html
you can make dumb things like that.
Yeah hes stuck
nah I'm here lol
sorry I'm doing paperwork for Coca Cola too
k
well that managed to fuck up my computer at least lol
anyways..what were we talking about?
No idea. Just got here. xD
yeah remind me to not click on that next time
umm
I think I'll just get back to filling out orders lol
haha
well actually I prolly could send you something lol...just a lot more paperwork
awww
How much?
He like Coka products?
Coke"
Yep
Loves it
drinks 3 bottles of coke every day consistently for as long as I can remember
haha
not nearly as bad as me lol..but still bad
no joke
I'm on my 8th right now
wow
thats crazy
yeah lol
I cant handle all the sugar
believe me it doesn't affect me
lol
not even the powershots do anything for me now
but I just learned today that they are prolly shutting our plant down next year
Pepsi does have more sweetner in it
Oh?
and corn syrup
Hopefully no
If it does i cant taste it.
I think I'm gonna be transfered down to the bigger plant
since I'm one of the few orderers they can actually tolerate
ok thats good then
very
I use to be attached to the drivers
w00t my quad xeon server came in today
How much does it cost?
and does the truck come here and unload.
but I'm not sure where the truck would drop it..my guess is at the nearest Coke Plant of some kind
I think Dari would be a little harder to pull off though lol
wow
thats pretty cheap
I'm not sure bud..I would have to check out just how they do it...when I place a personal order in for myself it drops it off right at the plant...but I think I can adjust it to personal addresses...something I would have to check on
lol cool
Always been interested in computers ever since i can remember
yeah
like I said
the only ones I know around here are all 20 plus
But hes asian, and you know the asians with computers...
dont know anyone like me IRL
My aunt is sort of good with computers... she wrote some software and tried to sell it...
Shes pretty cocky and outspoken all the time. Its annoying.
well...everyone except me in the family is computer inept
which is annoying since I have to set everything up
huh? I am not trying to argue with you or anything
I know lol
Just saying I get phonecalls daily to do free work i am never paid for
and i cant say no to family
Just saying I can only imagine that amount of shit you do
I can say no to some of them lol
Don't think I even ruturned the call
heh
and earning
then I can leave it alone and go do other things
Def earning
the annoying part is getting it tested and working
earning, as in getting money.
yeah I know lol
it's definetly making earnings..you just have to work pretty freaking hard
Oh I thought you meant "define" when you said def.
oh no lol
Yeah, I prefer projects I can finish and forget about.
yeah
Dont usually need to touch them again.
I hate leaving things incomplete
I freaking had to deal with the largest paranoid worker in our branch today @.@
he forgets shit all the time...leaves things incomplete
I find it hard to work on the same thing for more than a week
same thing with me and dealing with multiple accounts
gotta sort priorities.
yes we do
I have more then enough examples of that
Oh yes?
yup
Interesting.
about how they talk about me IRL
I laughed when they said they actually call me "spyrorocks" IRL
oh?
lol
well I do the same thing with everyone online except my best friend
you guys talk on the phone?
well I know you are looking at that blackberrty
"blackberry"
her phone got munched by the washing machine
yeah
yeah I heard about that lol
I am going to go grab one
once I get my check
or checkS i should say
well I guess when you are use to names like these...kinda hard to fall out of it
haha
I keep telling them to use my name lol
I like my friends to know me by name
haha
I bet lol
I have only met one person that I talk to online
actually two technically....but I don't talk about the other one
I met someone online that coincidentally went to my school (before I left school)
well
well It's not like I can do it every day....but it was enjoyable
my best friend lives out ther
and....my ex..
nice
needless to say I'm much more cautious when it comes to long distance relationships
Oh?
Interesting
it's a long story
I only trust it to my friends
OK, no problem.
but I do trust you..so I really don't think it's a problem
I went through a very painful two year long distance relationship with her
I was 18 at the time...she was 15 I believe
think it was 2 1/2 years apart or something
but after a couple months we really fell into each other hard
very
believe me
but I was just out of High School
and I went right into the Navy
didn't talk to her for two months
which after everything was pretty hard to deal with
hmmm
sorry
disconnected
but I kept my promise to her that I would get out there
and It was this past June...I was 19 and she was 17
needless to say we didn't do anything because I'm not stupid
2 years of nothing but talking and we were finally together for an amount of time
its alright
but I only got 5 hours with her
then I had to fly back home
yup
last line i saw
timezones?
that was my time
oh i see
PST I am behind a lot of people.
but I was extremely commited to her
didn't want to leave most of the time
but I was warned constantly by my father that she was still young...and I def should have listend to him
to which I knew something was going on...and finally force her to tell me
and it all fell apart by then?
to me...almost everything did
but she lied to me about it
I much rather you tell me to my face then lie to me
and I put a lot of energy and time into her...and all and all I did lover her with all my heart
I am extremely commited to my relationships...and I put a lot into them
but I slipped into a pretty bad depression
yeah man I'm right there with you
but I couldn't eat or sleep
lost weight
Thats one of the tradeoffs I made when I decided to get into business at my age.
well it's always gonna be tradeoffs
but thankfully my father was there for me when I needed someone
and my friends
tried to get involved with places like spyroforum for example
and writing
just to be around people and develop some social skills again
as I am
over time...things seemed to be working
we made it work for 2 years
I guess I am the same way.
and he knew just how commited I was to her
she supported me going out to see her
"He"
believe me man...the good times were the best feelings ever
in the end yes....it gave me an immense amount of pain
and I wish I could make it go away
and I wouldn't take back the time we had together for anything
If she ever approached you again, would you talk to her?
I'm much more wiser when it comes to such things
well
as it stands
I have not talked to her in 4 months
and I'll leave her one on her birthday
but I told her before I left
that I would stay commited for one more year
even though she isn't with me
I still remember several of the things she said to me
Thats pretty cool actually.
"I can see myself with you 10 years from now...but for now my heart doesn't need you."
well she is stil young man
she isn't even 18 yet
she has much growing to do
but I'm not leaving this open for long
Thats actually a pretty cool story.
because like I said .....I wouldn't trade it for anything
I am glad you shared it with me.
well
especially my friends
I was never in the "dating scene".
well everyone is different man
It just didn't appeal to me.
you dont' have to be
you're 15 years old
you have plenty of time to date
AGREED.
yes they do
Best statement ever.
but that's not the wise thing to do
relationship wise
heck I'm 20..and it's still hard for me to control it
I am screenshotting that quote
Because its exactly how I think.
which quote are you talking about
stop downloading lol
I blame the media.
you can blame a lot of things man
they have not aspiration
not even to develop their minds
all that matters is how they feel and everyone should cater to them
Well Hail isn't exactly the sharpest tool out there lol
one quote that I do like using
Our country was found on the principle "Life in Persuit of Happiness."
I think if anything, the media and teeny bopper tv shows do get into the minds of children/
(Thats a decent movie)
it is
but the quote finishes with this
Now our country runs on the principle "Life garunteed Hapiness'
hmmm
that's how the average person sees it now
It's a principle that is decaying our society
"succeed"
We all have to be "buddy buddy"
Have to freaking sugarcoat everything
Agreed.
idk anymore man. Like my sister for example...she considers everyone she meets her "friend"
but every single freaking person she meets is her "friend"...and of course being the teenage girl...she is gossip queen central
how many of these friends gladly stab you in the back to look good
hmmm
they would be there for me if I needed it
and I would gladly return the favor
17
she freaking makes fun of me because none of my friends are around..and I have only a few
I just reply that every single one of her friends is talking some shit gossip about her right now..at least I don't have to worry about backstabbing
I just know how to pick lifelong friends
hahaha
All my friends changed after I left school.
They are still my friends, but they aren't the same people.
if they do they are a very rare person
but if you find one...keep them close
but yea sorry..didn't mean to rant
that time already
I should have gave you another 100 quotes lol..
need to sleep, good night.
night SR
There is a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot
have fun at school!
Night!

oi
nice little co-write
well it's not going to be very little for long lol
right now it is :D
it's only 3,000 words
But yeah...we really want to blow the top off the Spyro section
this one is the sequel
Oh man i just remembered
0.o
SR did you want to see the story?
Yeah I tried to give him some good advice on that
"No one has the right to hurt you."
thats why I said "one"
yeaaaah
the military kinda has em everywhere @.@
quote
haha
I laughed at that one for a while.
lol
Yeah he tells it like it is.
good
as in self defense?
whatever you do.
paralyzing
breaking
I know just about all of em
cool
I don't do anything for "self defense", just do it because its fun.
Oh? Is there a story?
yeah a little one
lol
well
I was just out of A school
but apparently she got in a pissing match with one of her best friends ex boyfriends
and not to mention mentally unbalanced
I know the type.
but I heard them arguing (I was picking her up)
and told him that if he touched her I would fucking kill him
not usually my style...but he was getting bad
but it's not something I like doing
I do it when I have to defend someone or myself
but I would never a fly...I prefer to help people
never "harm"
i see
just wanted to protect my sister

7Dari: Then I THINK that means Rurik actually won. You're now fighting a losing battle and failing terribly.
......MUST.....HOLD.....BACK....................................
4I think I kinda set myself up there, but meh
That wasn't ment to be sent

That must be satisfying
He's very insulted; you called him a "n00b"

4but I here
Hello
13RAWR>
Gah
You scared me /sarcasm
13lol
/me 13finished organizing favorites on dA
Plus, you are a n00b if you call others n00bs
13No...
How is being called a n00b an insult? :P
13You're a n00b if you're a n00b and you call a "senior" or respected member a n00b.
I didn't call asnyone a n00b I was making a statement
13BlueFusion: That's cool :D
Correct
Lol
erm soz lol
7I don't care. It's a theory you support
Lol
13lol

7Nerd.
:P
I've heard about you from other people, and argued with you a couple times already
7I actually have a reputation? Cool.
Not a good one, but a reputation, yes.
7Lol.
7Hey dari, you got GHWT, right? I got mine yesterday. =D

Yes. I suck lots on drums
Lol
4here we go...
-__-
XD
7You didn't 'win', you declared you won and then completely ignored me until the subject was changed
7Bullshit.
7That doesn't count, I was pointing out that Yahoo was calling herself a n00b, although she doesn't really need to. The evidence speaks for itself
7Whatever
Lol
Nah
Kieran's little paddies keep this place alive
Oh not this again..
7Whether or not the feeling's mutual is a debatable subject
4he the father?
Lol no
7Rurik: No, charlie's a girl. :P
4oh
4I knew Yahoo had the hots for her
That was my reaction
7I scared now.
but I screamed it
7Dari: Naw, I tricked her into admitting she likes you, and if you simply gather the evidence you see the truth.
Ya
That's it
13.....
/me 13is pissed.
Sorry
/me 4doesn't care
Doesn't count, it wasn't on the same line

10IE just crashes on me all the time :(
if you haven't, download and install and run the latest AVG or NOD32
AVG annoyed me
NOD32 is _the_ best, AVG is a close second.
lol
I'd be asking you that.
If you think AVG is crap, you clearly have too many viruses for it to do a clean install
A lot of viruses try to prevent antivirus progs being installed.
10OH FXCKING CHIHUAHUA CLOUDS!!!

And now you've got this problem
Suffice to say, you fucking moron.

13Ok....
13Dammit
13*ded*
aw..
brb
13...
/me 13kills a hybrid.
13brbz
4...random
...very....
13blah.
Woah, where'd everyone go?
13Hi
Hey
13RDX said he'd brb, Magiky had to go and Batty just left
13lol
That was fast..
Neopets, club penguin, email friends....
We're only supposed to get a half hour each from 3-4:30
13That sucks.
My brother used to have a club penguin account
he probably still does have it, auto renewing on my moms credit card she forgot about
I really don't see the point of club penguin
13LOL
It's just like
"R U TAKEN!?!"
13Lolwtf?
13lol...
Random people coming up to her asking her with horrid grammar if she's taken.
I think you can only say pre-defined messages, right?
13there is a lot of that though too
wtf
13on some sections yeah
13you can type
"Taken"?
13I have to type in chatspeak on there if I am talking to someone
Like, if she has a boyfriend
She's 11 T___T
...
13Yeah, it's stupid
Yeah I know, stupid
13I just ignore it normally.
13It's also why I make my penguin crossdress
13Ololololololol
13Everyone else: "EWWWWWW"
I thought you could only say pre-defined things
The club penguin headquarters is like a 3 hour drive from my house.
13NO TANK U
4U SUC
13Spyrorocks: HAHAHA
13THERE'S A HEADQUARTERS!? XDDDDD
13Rurik: I NO RITE
Hah wow
Neoseeker headquarters is a 1 hour drive
Yeah, where they concoct evil plans.
Yeah, on some servers you can only say predefined things.
My sister has gotten into all sorts of e-drama on there already, apparently
Neo is in Richmond I think
Yeah
you can't do anything
and also
they require you to be over 18
...
why dont they let the adults say whatever they like?
seriously?
That's stupid
If I remember correctly it says you need to be 18 or older
13HAHAHAHAHA
13Wow
Yep
No one
4wtf
but you can't really do it because of how they have it coded.
It doesnt send a message, it sends a message ID
if it receives "1", it displays that.
The dragons bounce up and down, hahaha
:P
It looks really stupid
they have some decent artwork though
7Hell dari!

o.o
dari hasn't been around for a while.
Wow, my jawva teacher needs to update the grades more
he changed his name a whiel ago
I presume you get a lot of A's
I still don't know
just a guess
I'll probably get it back on Tuesday
No school on Monday
I actually finished it in time for once, though
Hopefully that's a good sign
Not that simple, lol
any exams
I don't know....I barley did anything in school and still did well
Pff, usually I can get As without studying
Just not in... some classes -_-
yeah I know how you feel lol
i hate classes where you have to read alot
o rly du ya?
are you in college yet lol
I don't really do well in any "classes"
Soon
I should say subjects.
hm
lol
I need a laptop for college
i dont read alot
if you are in college
I already have to read quite a lot
Not that I always do
XDDD
yeah..
I don't like reading..
lol at commy government
I do
depends on the book
and school books are not it
niether do I lol
seeing as how I'm not in school
I still have another four and a half years of school
I just listen to lecture and i get by enough
well...college is kinda different for me
Id like to do well with school, but I just can't be arsed.
I can't wait to be out of high school
It sucks
Control yourself = No cat... loving.
^ LOL
Haha no =P
http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/17/saudi.child.marriage/
ur face luvz tht movee lol
I just wasn't cut out for it I guess
eh wtf are you lookin at
Pretty much every night I read news for fun.
Yes, I am a loser.
by lookin at thhat address id be thinking something else
I have had enough of the news for now
too much about how wonderful a certain president elect is
haha
wow that was wierd...again
The debate over the controversial practice of child marriage in Saudi Arabia was pushed back into the spotlight this week, with the kingdom's top cleric saying that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed.
I got to hear about how wondeful he was today in front of Baltimore -.-
woopdy doo
eh..
think I pissed off some people lol
She said the marriages cause girls to "lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."
ummm
well they were watching it on the tv in the employee lounge
I walked by and stopped for like a minute
and I think I said someting like welcome to la la land
Hahaha
The best thing to do
needless to say I escaped pretty fast
Is to say something
then not argue it.
I speak my mind
I don't care
Haha, good thing you got away quickly
unless I know it's something really bad to say lol
Just keep on saying things and ignoring people when they try to argue them with you.
yeah they are
I tried that with my aunt once
oi
The phyco one
I haven;t seen any change yet.
not the change we want that's for sure
their wont be
Change is over rated.
he is already making excuses
"It's worse then I feard"
Didn't he create the "office of the president elect" or something?
i think he'll try but i do hope that he does good otherwise we'll be in the shitter
yeah yeah
I read something about that
i know that
*So
Yeah, kind of old
yeah
and I live in a neigborhood of liberals -.-
Minnesota is one of the most liberal states in the country
oh yeah I forgot
lol when i heard of waterboarding i though it was a type of surfing
we don't want to be the bad guys anymore
lol
we have to be nice to everyone!!
even terrorists
I was surprised that someone in my neighborhood had put up a huge McCain/Palin sign in their front yard during the election season
^ good for them
We put up conservative signs here.
Yeah, let's sit down with the terrorists and talk with them reasonably
main ones.
Stupid... -_-
Haha, yeah
but no....we have to be their friends
If you hear a ticking noise, it's just them err, crumbling into reason... :P
oi too much news
"Hey, would you mind not bombing Israel?" "Oh sure, we hate them, but since you asked, we'll do it for you, Obama!"
Yeah, that's gonna work
you know it -.-
welcome to the liberal mind
let's be friends
Heh
I swear....I wouldn't care if Israel turned Iran into a parking lot
Should north america intervene in a war thats been going on in centuries?
well that's the problem
North american countries
if we do nothing
that is.
they say we don't care
we got our own problem
when we do something
Apparently it could start World War 3
they call us murderers
It HAS been bad for thousands of years.
the world has been on the verge of WW3 for years
I suppose if [Israel is] severely outnumber against a ton of Arab nations, yes.
*outnumbered
o.o
everyone has their finger on a button
this world is really really dangerous
But it's a huge mess
Basically
well
put it like this
IF they stop waring, its a sign of the end times.
and nothing is between the Arabs and Israel
hmmmm
Israel doesn't exactly want another Halocaust
lots of them
they attacked us for crying out loud
when we snooped too close
2...
2Okkkk
haha
12arabs? Huh
Who's "they," exactly?
palistinians i think
that being everyone around them
Syria...Egypt...Iran
Administrators at an Indiana hospital said one of the three numbers listed for the hospital in the latest AT&T phone book connects callers to a phone sex line.

I'm glad someone is willing to listen :D
You guys?
It's kind of interesting
umm
TS0!
Alright
I never heard of them :P
Trans-Siberian Orchestra
I don't listen to much music
but anyways...yeah I have some pretty realistic views about it
after all...we learn most by looking to the past
I like music, I just can't be bothered to download songs I like to my MP3 player and listen to them over and over
He does some awesome st00f
11o_O
11>=[
and yes Copelands music was awesome
:3
Yeah, I'm going to St. Mary's University =]
St Mary's eh
In a few months
yep
heard of it
4O_o
Really?
yes I have lol
...
hah, I only applied to two colleges
I applied to four
I looked at four
I got kind of stressed filling out all the applications
Not yet
wow no essay?
I'll figure it out as I go along, I suppose
that's how most do it
I didn't even know mine
well...kinda
that's why I went where I did
If all goes well, I might only have to pay $6000 for four years
It's awesome
oh wow
I thought mine was cheap :P
Winona State University just got back to me about my admission
6k for four years?
I'm accepted, but no aid yet =P
that is a really good deal
anyone have anything fun to do?
I have been working all day
need some fun time.
don't feel bad :D
I would if I could.
Umm
Aww... =P
I said fun.
Dude, that is fun
Just thought I'd ask anyway
Cant watch it
You could... help me with this Jawva thing
lol
when I get broadband
Fun, eh? :P
XD
But now they are running broadband lines up here
Nice
Seriously? :P
I didn't think you'd want to... XD
Doesn't matter
I'll write the code myself
hm
ok
Oh, I know
It's the textbook
I know you need to draw a circle
You can hook my site up :P
Hmmm no.
XD
That's fine
Makes everything more complicated than it needs to be
Byethost is a great host
Oh in that case
I wont have to bother atisteo
Alright

I've been up for a month, have a successful site, and have only used 50mb of bandwidth
There
I got it
k
:)
Don't ask why I remembered the login
Because it's just that important
RaidonMakoto: One of my sites just used up 30gb of bandwidth yesterday.
Which one and how?
T_T
T_____T
Can't say.
T___________T
But it has a lot of downloads
Oh
Well, I don't have anything like that on my site
All my images are hosted on Imageshack
How much do you have done?
To minimize the Bandwidth usage XD
aka leech of others

You need *all that* code to make a circle?

I'll take a look at it and see if it makes any more sense....

Understand the mechanics of circular drawing?
I haven't actually looked at it yet
11ummm!
Been talking on here =P
g.drawOval(50,75,100,100);
thats basically it
g being a graphics object
whatever the heck that is.
4Stop spamming
What's a graphics object.... D=
11stormy are you on mibbit
Yes
Err, no
Whoops
Dont you need to create a graphics object or something?
11oh.
Or is the graphics object a handle to the applet gui thingie?
Who's spamming?
I've never done anything with "graphics objects" before
4Snowy. She kept repeating the same thing over and over
Oh
do you know how to draw anything to screen?
Yeah
I'm not really sure why, but it's just not connecting right now....
I mean...
Have you created an applet that can draw something
anything
11...
11huh
11...?
Yes, I've done that before
OK, how did you do that?
11Too, much tech talk here..
It was a simple one though
Use bits a pieces
11o.o Mind boggling.
and did you have a graphics object
of some sort

Mehh, I'll figure it out eventually I guess
I can't think right now....
:(
seriously though look http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/showtopic18752.htm
I dont do a lot of GUI work
especially not in jawva
It's not really drawing the circle that's the problem though
I could do just that pretty easily
well you should have told me that 20 minutes ago :P
LMFAO
haha sorry
:(
Forget it....
can you draw a circle to the screen?
just a single circle
Yeah
Just a circle.
OK
Now
Lets take it step by step.
Just... forget it... thanks for trying though
I'm just gonna go ahead and respond to bmah

I would ask if that was the toolbar, but you got rid of them all =P

Get a good Terabyte one
That'll last you two years :P
Probably arguing in the policical stance thread
Probably
But I don't like to have to plug it in
Oh, fun
oh it was just on the political thread
and take it with me
as times move on i download more and more
it like multiplies.
I promised myself I wouldn't argue about this anymore @.@
Can't you fit a terabyte into a laptop now, though?
Its not 2.5inch
Thought you could...
I dont think they make a 2.5inch TB
you reading it lol
Yep
changes things up
They've got half a terabyte SSD for a laptop now

Umm, PIZZA!!?
Showing off?
Oh Henry
Henry? :P
Well someone is having a pizza parteh
Gahhh, I hate java
Things: I want some pizza too.
Screw it, I'll work on it later
Bad spellers, untie!
Procrastinators unite... tomorrow!
hm
I got a million of these
Java, though, no thanks
:P
well some of it makes sense..
hahaha
I can see the message he is tyring to get out
Bush was an idiot
Plain and simple
/me catches the box'opizza
Every kind >.>
pretty narrow view..but I'm not gonna say anything
Oh, how George Washington is rolling in his grave
XD
yeah especially since the one running our country now has promised everything to everyone that is in no way gonna be delivered
Ohhh, this is not going to end well....
The thing with Bush, though
yeah right
After he fixes the economy
no
lmao
Which, granted
I know that everything has priorities
*wont happen in 8 years
And some things just can't be done
have you seen the "plans" this man wants to put into action
And the bailouts were good and wholesome?
Things: you there?
Yeah ?
Tell marianne that her server is murdering me.
Hahha whats it doing ?
Government and Alternative Energy are going to get more jobs
Killing me
the average american is and IDIOT!
Government jobs, like fixing roads and bridges
hey now
yeah live off the government right
Creating street signs
The menial crap
mooch of all of them
yeah right
No, not necessarily
I'm not gonna take any government crap
It both benefits the country
and its murdering me when I connect
the liberals can have la la land
And is a starting point for the economy
and it's not goign to benefit the country
I think her server is racist or something.
It is...?
more and more people
can't hold a simple job
Oh
they can't
Thats weird
they have no willpower
Cause her own laserchat website usues mibbit :P
they suck off the government
LMFAO
this country has been getting more lazy for the last 40 plus years
ever since social securtiy
they watned to create a "perfect society"
Dude
Err, sarcasm =/
when they came with the idea of giving everything to everyone
because they lived here
now everyone expects something
There's no way you can blame the economic mess entirely on Bush
Subprime Lending, depletion of the treasury, failing wars
Wasn't the cause of the failed economy loans that lazy people couldn't pay back...?
Things: REALLY?
Sort of
Yup
I'm not putting faith in any plan that is going to have me paying off thousands of my own dollars for nothing
Well, the money went to the parents, but they got $1000 for each kid
banks gave out loans to people with no colaterol
Hahaha
They got lazy
people are more lazy now then ever...and it's getting worse
they still should of had colaterol
the average american can't even find this country on a map
dude now that is tupid
Stimulus\.
Thats communist.
But they don't...
We don't do that
Am I right?
at least they had a sense of purpose
I think its like 30 weeks
most people don't do shit in this country
I haven't been unemployed though
I think you're generalizing
The reason a lot of people don't have jobs is because of layoffs
Because people can't buy things
no I just don't hide behind the "pitty' wall
Because people don't have jobs
if you want to make something of yourself then do it
I do?
And a lot of other people do
most poeple can't hold the average job
Because of this no child left behind crap
And again, you're generalizing
this just isn't schoo things
I see ite every day
4Better?
Yes
lol
Switch it around
Raidon, you be blue
I see many places
4I'm a libertarian actually
thanks to my job
Makes more sense =P
4Red is my color D:
2I'm liberal though, SR :P
But this is American politics :P
4 0.o
4wow I'm not use to this
I know
because its irrelevent.
8Libertarians are yellow?
8Is this visible?
4hardely
No, change it nao plz
2XD
2Anyways
It's hurting my eyes
2Your view is wrong
Ohhhh
Libertarians hurt my eyes.
4and yours is right?
There's a good comeback
2All you're seeing is a select view of people
2That came out wrong
4oh give me a break
2...
4I swee it eveywhere I go
4you're going to tell me
2This is like comparing microeconomics to macroeconomics
2You're only looking at a tiny part of the country
4that their are more "intelligent hard working people' in this country
2I'm not going to say they're evenly distributed
2Because people are dumb shits
2They need to stop asking the mexicans where America is
2And ask people that actually give a crap
2Right
4so we have a neverending cycle of idiots beeing bred
4yeah pretty much. This country has been going downhill for years as I said
4we are getting more lazy every yea
4"year'
4well I see the truth
4I don't sugarcoat things
2Okay
4I don't see false promises
4no thanks
4I see where things are going
4dude I work for a living
2Have you looked elsewhere
2Like, where there are jobs?
4idk...lets look...even the simple things
4wal mart
4kfc
4and of course they get fired
4because they can't even do that
2Yeah, because they decide to take baths in the dish cleaner at KFC
2That's because of bad parenting
2That kids think
4the bad parenting that is being spread
2:Oh, I'll go be a gangbanger, I don't need a degree for that."
4hence why we have more and more idiots
2No, see
4nobody cares anymore..it's all about ME
2The problem is that we don't have a good education system
2Because, again, of no child left behind
2That's one of the principles of Economics
2No shit
2No Child Left Behind
4selfish the point where they just dont' care about anything
4hence the liberals give them everything
4which they take away form workers
2That's... the opposite of Selfish
4who actually do something!
2And no, the liberals don't give them everything they want
4yeah right..they promise them everything and you know it
If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more?
4pretty much
4I work hard every day
4and I"m gonna get charged more!
2I don't mind paying taxes
2What
4feel sorry for everyone
2And the bailouts aren't a pity fest for those on Wall Street?
4we have to give everyone equal rights
2Social Darwinism?
If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more? Because I can "afford" to be?
4liberals and lawyers
4great combination
2Yeah, SR, pretty much
That's stupid
Thats dumb
2Hey, go to Iran then
People could just sit there and do absolutely nothing
2Its like association fees for living in a Condo
Out of the USA
4the harder working people get more screwed over every yea
4"year"
and Iran
2Dude
4supposedly
4this war isn't pointless thank you
4join the military like me
it is not pointless
4"is'
2So we were in there under false pretenses
4I'm not gonna sit here and watch something else burn
4no thanks
2Dude
4the towers were more then enough
exact;y
RaidonMakoto: Are you part of the army/navy?
*exactly
4I have been with those men
4and that's to keep those terrorists away from us
4thank you for pointing that out Dari
2...
2Iraq or Afghanistan?
4I know things and reasons why we went into Iraq
4I'm not allowed to share them
2XD
2Seriously
4are you in the military?
4join it sometime
2No
2RDX
Heh, I've noticed
2We went to Iraq for WMDs
2They had none
4maybe you can learn something
2They had no ties to Al-Quadea
Just didn't have anything to say back =P
4oh you don't know the half of it
4believe me
2 2% of those we're fighting are Al-Quaeda
4lol
2WTF are you, CIA?
4nope
Not that good at multitasking sorry =P
of course you can
4lol
:P
4no I can't
RaidonMakoto: Thank you.
2There is no reason to be in Iraq
Hey, and you don't?
4believe me MP's have their advantages
hahahaha
You're just as bad, if not worse
2If we're at war, the public should know the reason, amirite
4really..why don't you go over their and find out for yourself
2We were told bullshit reasons
4and you do know that 90% of the media are liberals
2What? The 2% Al-Quaeda or the 98% enraged occupants
4oh yeah I forgot about that
4they pretty much twist everyrhint
4"everything"
Fox is the other 10%
2And Fox News doesn't?
4yeah they are lol
4yeah all 10% of them!
Oh boo hoo hoo, let's all complain because there's one news channel that's biased the other way
2CNN
4lol
2Watch it some time
/Something/ has to at least balance it out
4I do thanks
2Pretty unbiased, IMO
4now go watch just about every daytime television broadcast
Yep
2See, I don't
One show I can;t stand is The View
Why do people watch that?
4oh wow
4shocker
2I get my news from CNN.com, which is pretty unbiased
2However, that isn't the point
2That's completely divergent to the fact that those we're fighting in Iraq aren't Al-Quaeda
2brb - Foodz
Wow
4innocents don't ya know!
Attacks on the usa?
4lol
4I'm not angry though lol
4lol
I guess
Umm
pretend you are.
4lol
4we have our reasons for going into Iraq believe me
4I wish I could state some of them
:P
2Back
4and yeah they prolly would lol
4knowing my luck
2I'm going to call bullshit on that
4Well, wouldn't taht suck
shut*
2If you were privvy to classified information
:P
4lol
4again it's something you don't understand
2Yeah
2Lawl
2Try me
4unless you join the military
2...
2I know people in the military
2And I have never heard this before
4and see some of the shit i have
2Oh, boo hoo
2You saw people die
2You saw kids play soccer with skulls
2No reason to waste billions of dollars in a pointless war
OK, why would he be making it up? Why would he be fighting in the military if there was no reason?
4actually I have not seen someone die thanks
There must be one
2Okay, fine
2Are you deployed atm?
It's just not logical that there isn't
4I have not been into the killzone yet
2Okay
4and no I'm not
Or there would be no one out there
4my only deployment has been to Europe
2But you've never been to Iraq?
2Bull. Shit.
4Dude I'm part of the Military Police
2Classified information is on a need-to-know basis
No, know-to-need basis.
2If you were serving in Europe, they would't tell you
In soviet russia.
4this isn't that kind of information that you are refering to. We had our own reaons for going into Iraq
2XD
2For Daddy Bush's good image?
Good image?
4you go serve yourself you bastard and you find out
I think the last thing Bush cares about is his image...
2And yet, of the millions of people in the Military
Exactly
4I'm not part of a normal division genius
2Orly?
T___T
2Try me. I said try me.
2XD
4lol
4no no I"m sad to say not
4is pretty popular in India though
Special division of the military, officer of tasty beverages.
4lol
2I got a novel idea
2Let's beef up domestic security then
2Prince-Dari: It was
4lol
2For how long?
2If we keep deploying our military all around the world
2What?
4I don't want to see more innocents fall from the towers
4that was just horrifying
4our forces were not even deployed when 9/11 occured
2That's because of incompetance
4is it now
2Bush got a briefing on his desk
2A month before it happend
Are you saying they should have been deployed?
4so if it happens now it's because our military is away
2"Bin laden determined to strike"
2And it even labeled the WTC as a potential target
2And Bush ignored it
4and needless to say ever since then nothing has happend to this country
2The man really fucked up
4and yes the deaths are nothing to celebrate
4we have had many good men killed
brb
2More people died in Iraq than WTC
4I'm not going to sit back and watch it happen again
2And, I would like to add, they died in Iraq pointlessly
2Yes
2But invading Iraq does not stop attacks
2If anything, it promotes them
4is that pointless as well?
2That's beside the point
4is it now
2Yes
4more poeple die because they are drunk over here
2Because Iraq was preventable
2Go back to my main point
2Invading Iraq does not stop attacks
2It only promotes them
4really?
4I have not seen them yet..where are they?
4if they do happen
2You noticed how more people wanted to blow themselves up when we invaded Iraq?
4it's not gonna be under Bush's watch
4yeah over there
4not here
4where their are innocents
2Because they can't get over here
4the middle east was willing to blow itself up to begin with
2The Middle East has no Navy, no Air Force
4it has been going on for tthousands of years
2Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's still killing citizens
4they have no desire to have anything
2Of America
4except their religius beliefs
2...
2Now you're stereotyping
2Only Islamic Extremists blow themselves up
4Why cause I'm saying the truth?
4extremists want something horrible
2Now, people are pushed into Extremism whe we do this shit
4religious wars
4like always
2...
2There were less extremists before we invaded Iraq
4it's been going on since the freaking crusades
How do you know that?
2Yeah, difference is though
4because he just knows
4don't ya know
2They were some crazy nutter faction before we justified their actions
How can you even prove that?
2People feel they have to take matters into their own hands
4We are considered evil when we do somehting
2Al-Quaede recruitment shot up when we Invaded
4then not caring when we don't do anything
No one goes around to people's doors and asks, "Oh, hi, are you an extremist?"
2<RaidonMakoto>: Al-Quaede recruitment shot up when we Invaded
Proof?
4I'm not going to watch Osama Bin ladin on freakign tapes wanting to kill our people
4not thanks
=P
2Huh?
4he tried it before and failed
But really
4tried it again and was successful
4and watns to do it more
4Hell no!
2Okay
4I"m not gonna sit and watch that happen
2I have a novel idea
2Instead of invading a pointless country, let's focus on capturing Osama
2People can be swayed to beliefs
What's important is that the attacks aren't happening
2For recruitment
4The extremists were always there. They were there before the invasion...and the attacks would have continued
4what's important is that we keep them over there
4not here
2Yes
2But there weren't people in Iraq that wanted to blow themselves up to get us out until AFTER we went into Iraq
2So, let's kill him
2Let's just kill all the Muslims
2Even though only a few of them hold the Extremists beliefs
4how do you know
2What about the Christians that bomb abortion clinics?
Wtf
Bombing abortion clinics?
2We can't
2Which is why we can't justify a Crusade
2Christian Extremists bomb abortion clinics occassionally
No one does that though....
Or not that I've heard of...
2Google it
2Again, you're stereotyping, RDX
4am I now
2Not everyone holds the Jihad view
4I'm not arguing with history
4no only most of them. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be everone's friend
2That's /still/ stereotyping
Kind of is stereotyping though. I know some Muslims and they're definitely not extremists.
4go watch the movie kindgom of heaven sometime
Pretty nice people actually
4I've seen enough to know my faith in the matter
2...
2Oi
2But in Iraq
2They're defend their HOMELAND
2Not being tools of their religion
2Big difference
2Let's suppose that China took control of the US
2Would you be a part of the revolution to get them out?
2Its essentially the same thing in Iraq
2People are trying to get the US out of Iraq by any means necessary
2People do crazy things when cornered
2Okay
2What do you mean by that?
2No
I don't think he's saying he does
2Iraq didn't either
There's kind of a difference
2Al-Quaeda attacked us
2Whom were based in Afghanistan
2Iraq had no connection
2But Iraq didn't pose a threat
2They had no WMDs
2They weren't making any either
4you don't know that
2Why not North Korea or Iran?
2I do know that, because UN inspectors found NOTHING
4and I again say that you don't know the half of it
2Then tell me the other half of it
2You can't debate on "I know something you don't"
2ROTFLMAO
2Seriously, ROTFLMAO
4you can accuse me of whatever you want to
2You are saying
2That America put the UN up to saying that there weren't WMDs?
2No one government can put the UN up to do anything
4their are more then just the United States at work here. Far more
2One sec
2Let me retrieve something
4and unless they have been lying to me
4then I still hold firm to my own beliefs
4just like everyone does
2Okay
4this is why I don't like arguing about this
2So the other forces in work are... Romania?
2You've been lied to then
2<RedDragonX>: their are more then just the United States at work here. Far more
4there is
2Since the UK is bailing
2Then tell me
2You cannot have a debate with no evidence
2All you're saying is "I'm right because I know something you can never comprehend."
4when are you going to understand that I can't freaking tell you anything about it. I have said it ten thousand times
4I am just defending my own views on it
2That's why religious debates are bullshit, because religious folks fall back on the "Well, look in the Bible."
2So
4I learn from history
2To why we invaded Iraq
2That many other people know
4and history is doomed to repeat itslef
4over and over again. It's not going to stop'
2Not for six years?
2No leaks?
4and it's not going to be America that launches first
2Bull. Shit.
4what did you say Dari?
2I've backed up all my statements
2You rely on "I can't tell you"
4and it's not my fault that I'm in a position where I can't share information. That's just where I have brought myself today
2We can make it safer by attacking random people?
4I joined and I'm here
2Making enemies is not going to make us safer
2Tell me
4the enemy is over there
4not here
2Are you deployed in Europe right now?
4actually I'm on leave. I'm in the states until I get my next assignment
2You really think that the Iraqis are going to swim over the Atlantic Ocean
2*Pacific
=/
2After we leave their country?
2Al-Quadea had nothing to do with Iraq
2Osama PITIED Saddam
2Because Saddam let the Jews into his country
2Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11
2Again, why not Iran?
4Al Quida had contacts that we went for in Iraq
2There are more people from Al-Quada in Pakistan
2So we should take down every dictator then?
2If we're pegging dictators, let's go to war with Cuba
4I can't talk for my superiors
2I would also argue that both have WMDs in Iran
2Which far outweighs Saddam's imaginary WMDs
4and it's going to start with Israel
2Israel has the strongest army in the world
2They'll be fine on their own
4thats the point
4when the Arabs go for them
4which they wil in a matter of time
4Israel isn't going to let another freaking halocaust happen
2Yeah
4pretty close Dari
OK
4they even attacked us
2They have a lot of technology and training
4when we freaking snooped
OK Listen to me for a second
pay attention to me.
2kk
4k
I need to vent for a minute
2A'ight
12Huh?
I usually don't get mad at people.
Especially my parents, because they usually don't piss me off.
But today, they really ticked me off
First
2XD
4lol
4 0.o
and she says "hey, look at this! This kid is just like you!"
She prints out his blong
blog*
and some articles about him.
=/
Now, that really pissed me off
4hm
for one, shes payed more attention to some random kid then she has never paid attention to me
2Is she trying to find you friends?
As if you couldn't find people "like you" if you wanted to.
4yeah
2Lolzifer
That really pissed me off.
2Tell her to fuck off
2:D
4lmao
4I'm in the mood to second that
OK, can we go back to the debate now :P
Its like a slap in the face without the physical pain.
2Start cutting yourself, they'll pay more attention to you then
I want to watch it for my last two minutes =P
4lol
4oh yeah only an hour for you
4I forgot
Mhhm
4or however long
debate
4I forget
9L59
4oi
2:/
1 minute
4that sucks
2Right
*9:59
2Where were we?
ping timeout
4idk
4where were we anyone know
4ah yeah
2Personally, I don't think we need to get involved in other's affairs
2If Israel wants to fight ,fine
4we don't
4just proves their resolve
4they don't want others screwing with them
2So>
2*?
2As long as we're not getting shot at, I call that a win
2I'm not seeing how this is a problem
2And yet, we haven't been attacked yet
2In this scenario
4no but that would involve the whole world would it not/
2No
4We are Israel's allies
4and that's not changing as far as I can see
2We were allies with Britain during the 2nd World War
2We didn't join WW2 until Japan attacked us
4this isn't ww2
2I'm saying
2America should have kept the Neutrality Acty
4I don't see that happening
2Which is why its great to not get involved
4everyone has their finger on a button
4that's a risk that is every evident
Bah
2Anyways, SR, you were venting?
2Oh
4you sure lol
4nothing else?
2>_>
2Anyways
2*risky
4I"m not refering to Iraq right now
2I'm comparing things here
2How do we know that the terrorists don't have a nuke?
Because no one can prove I sold it to them.
2Do you know how many nukes disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed? Its entirely likely
4either way we would be screwed
4everyone has access to them now
2I thought you said that all the Muslims wanted to die
2In Jihad
2Okay
2Then they should nuke us
2Because then we'd nuke them
4not all of the are extremists yes
4as you said
2As I recall, the Jews had Israel first
2Oh, NOW you agree with me
4The jews were given Israel
4that doesn't meant that the ARabs wont go after it
4they have plenty of times already
2Erm, no
2The Jews claimed Israel
4eerrrm yes
2And had it until Rome took it
2Erm, no
2The Bible is not a history book, sorry
Lets get our land back by blowing it up.
4It is their homeland. They are in control of it and they are not going to let Arabs, nor Syrians
2Thanks for playing though :P
4nor anyone aroudnt hem get into it
The Jews run the world.
4but if one nuke goes off I see nothing but more in the future...that's just how I picture it
2And, if we stay far away from it, then we'll be fine
4 0.o
They run the world.
4you can't stay far away from it today. That's impossible
2Far enough away to not get nuked, entirely possible
4no it's not
2Ghana doesn't look like its going to get nuked, IMO
4^that would be intresting
The jews run the world
They own the Federal Reserve
4SPYROROCKS IS JEWISH!
4yes it would be
4but I just see it happening
4you can't avoid it
2Yes, you can
4well needless to say that whenever whatever happens
ALLAH
2Well, you're going to Iraq
4I might be
2Shouldn't be long
4not certain yet
I don't think its something you would want to laugh at.
4hopefully not
2And watch out for Snipers
2I'll watch the Daily Show when it happens
4I like Colbert more
2You can't beat Stewart :/
2Colbert is really good though
4lol
2I like Bill Maher a lot too
4I like both of them
4both are pretty entertaining

Hiii
each one getting abused by alcohol :P
How does alcahol abuse you...?
Aleono can do those things
Ever made an alcohol bomb before?
Aleono is alcohol...?
No
Then it's not alcahol abusing them. :P
Aleono can control alcohol :P
...
How do you 'control' alcohol?
Omg, you don't know?!
Pouring it into a glass
...
......
That isn't controling it.
It is in someways
I have to say, the first two comics are of Gilden and Aleono

2Hey Dari: http://www.youtube.com/user/Dwaggies
Hey DFOKN
Haven't seen you in a while.
How are you?
2Good.
"Loch Ness Monster Vore 3"
Lol, WTH?
I'm watching that.
What's it from?
2Loch Ness Terror
LOL
2It was one of those movies on Sci-fi
Aww, you got it off at the end of the first one, just when he was about to get eaten.
You cut it off on the second one as well...
2:)
2Intentional
2Someone uploaded the whole movie.
2Don't know if its still up.
Lawl.
2It senses movement
2Any movement attracts its attention
Oh right.
13roar.
Still, when it's eating one of them, the others could run, yet they just stand there.
Lawl, you just see him get dragged off in the end.
Is that the end of the film?
Or do they kill it?
2They kill it.
How.
2Why can't they have movies where the people actually die....
I know.
2They burn a hole in it and stab a poison thingy into it.
Kind of crap.
Oh.
There's some film called basilisk or something.
Where some huge serpent goes round eating people.
They kill it as well, eventually.
:/
2I've seen that.
Heheh.
2If those movies were real, just stay near the main character.
LOL
2They never die.
Well I G2G
Cya.
Hey.
2oh great
5who are you?
Yes, I am great.

Apple element.

14Darioxide?
Then I made apple oxide.
Since A has a valency of 2.
14=.=
14Dari.
Yes, but if you diluted said apple oxide, couldn't you change the valency (at least in part) to change the afafirs, resulting in a much less dense product?

13Hai.
I actually got to talk to NPL.
13O RLY
YA RLY
13What'd she say, what'd you say?
I approached with the problem, and we worked it out.
I even checked with the annoying preps, and she HAS been avoiding them.
:P
13You sure she didn't just plan it all out
Nah, she didn't.
There were other people there that she wouldn't have lied to...
4hm
13Tell me everything, laewl
13*lawl
There's not much to tell.
Basically, the other accounts were a friend's.
Deleted all her friends and put some shit on.
They attacked thet one too, and screwed it all up.
*that
That's where the "whore" account came from.

He purports that he is privy to this 'grand secret'
Of the real reason we invaded Iraq
Personally I don't see how attacking a country that has nothing to do with it stops attacks, it just means that more people are dying in a different place.
12-.-
I told him, "No, its not."
Here we go ...
And he's like "I can't tell you."
And he never answered me when I asked how that helps.
i never said i cant tell you
I called him out, and he is unable to back up his story

They found them.
They were within naturally-occuring rocks.
7Aicebo: Because it's over-rated? :P *runs*
I learned it last year.
7Neon: ... Fair enough
There was an actual person credited with the discovery i think.
13Kjakings: No, because I keep discovering more and more flaws and loops in the story.
7^ Like Star Wars?
7:P
XDDDD
7Although Star Wars is epic enough to be forgiven
Lawl.
12I FOUND AN ALTERNITIVE TO PAYPAL!
7The Earth isn't a magnet, it just has a magnetic field.
^ Truth
Magnetic field pulls in metal.
= Magnetic.
There are virtually no magnetic rocks within the earth.
I mean really within.
^ Is it magnetic?
If it's molten?
10Dari is magnetic?!

Well if the moon drifted away we'd probably end up dying.
Should have thought about that before alerting me :P
Since the moon controls the sea partially.
And it was more like 5 nukes.
XD
And one exploded, then the next exploded, etc.
Which apparently created movement.
How did they gte the nukes that far down without they being incinerated?
*them
^ HAHA
I see.
And gradually all of them die.
Leaving 2 people.
Nor do I plan to.
Yep.
Haha.

/me 10changes channel
my friend does it all the time too
4hm
just try to be more open-minded than everyone else, I've found it helps
4now that he thinks "demons" have attacked his heart 0.o
which is kind of weird since were talking about christianity..its usually the flip side o.O;
/me 10snickers
DEMANS
2"Demons over there, KILL THEY ASS!"
2heh
LOL
well eh.. PM him about it?
most situations dont have to be resolved on public forums xD
13It's the "magic of the bible"
13=P
10*you do
4it's his beliefs
4nothing we can do to change them
10xDDDDD
10xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
LOL ^
10Besides, a "demon" would have to be able to (somehow) slip into the bloodstream
13Yes, of course, he loves EVERYONE
10Bahahahaha
ITS CALLED HEPATITUS
AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA

13I feel terrible laughing at him, but I just can't help it.
10Why are there wars?
Oh and there are arugments for this kind of thing ^
yeah I know
Ive seen a lot of them
brb for a little
10*snort*
I tend just to ignore overly religous people, rather than argue with them.
4no point in arguing
4you are not going to change anything
I know they have their beliefs, I have mine, I can't say anything to change their beliefs.
4"know"
4not before
4all you can do is live how you see fit
13I wasn't attempting to change his beliefs.
4I know you were not
13I've just had enough of him bringing it into everything and harassing the others
4that's just how I view religious arguements and such as a whole
13He needs to know when to stop.
10Every other post of his includes "God" or "Jesus"
13^indeed
13...lol
13*guessing, With
10Bahaha
13Because apparently it burns
13SO
13Idk?
2ouch
2heh
10xDDD
4that they put in a church
4and it's considered "holy"
2hehe'
By saying some prayer or other.
4it's just like marketing....it's presented that way as to cater to the beliefs...nothing more
/me 10sighs
2heh
It doesn't really count as marketing, as no one sells "Holy water".
2eh
10Isn't it supposed to burn demons or something like that?
2"It's like smoking a cactus.."
13RedDragonX: Yes, I did, and I laughed very hard.

Also, the formula milk doesnt contain many of the natural benefits that breast milk does, such as some nutrients and antibodies, which provide somewhat of a protection for many illnesses, such as, diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infections, and respiratory infection. Breast milk also contains the right amount of nutrients for development of the brain and nerves.
I think that's enough.

Common hardware errors, expensive games which are crap, disks are often damaged while being played, Xbox live (No need to explain this), it makes loads of noise, overheats, expensive, games freeze often, sometimes doesn't even detect the games.
The list goes on.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQL0vIdq3nY LOL
*current
Never heard of that happening.
And Xbox live is crap.
^ Explain.
Slow speeds, their servers are crap, they make you pay for extra things too.
OMG SAFFIE!

13oh, and...
13lolololol

Well mine is fine.
I've never had anything be slow on Live.
As I said, depends on how far you are from the people you are playing.

You used meta knight for most of the games.

Apparently he's banned from contests.
I used a variety, but then realized I'd have to actually trym using one of my favorites.
Because he's too good.
*try
I always use Kirby, lol.
Haha why?
He's fun to use.

Oh well that was pretty fun.
Next time I won't use Meta Knight.

And I like to make fun of it

Mmph... where's SR when you need him =/
That combat gameplay gives me a headache
And the story is cliche and predictable
And it's too linear

LOOOOL yeah
But...I still don't like it much
Yeah, I don't completely HATE it

About 3 hours into the argument.

Hmm

Hi.
Hello
Hey
I'm excited/
Why's that?
I'm getting something on Monday, I hope.
I won.
He gave up.
Hah.
I WIN!
=P
I HAVE PROVED THAT LOGIC IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS CAN BE DERIVED FROM OPINION, IF THE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE!
AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
"Ayumi"?
Anyone want to oppose me?
Ayumi was here?
7No, go away. No-one cares.
when?
7(@dari)
I dk
He's supposed to be permanently banned
No one said he was here
Why?
It is possible (although unlikely) that other people are interested.
Looong story
Long story?
Yeah
Yup
Lets just say it might take about a half hour to tell the entire thing
?
That's it in a nutshell
:O
I say good riddance
Seconded
7I say we poke him some more :P
Um, how?
Same.
7 5-1 odds on being Ayumi, 3-1 on being a supporter/doppel.
899a4a19.4ip1.windstream.net
Yeah, I noticed that too =/
O_o
I support NO ONE.
7Shoo poochy.
No.
I repeat, where is SR when you need him? D=
Ayumi.
...
Are you Ayumi?
Why do you hate me?
DJX: Are you Ayumi?
7Because you're a retard
Are you?

7Hey

7Don't take my voice when I'm pwning my arch-enemy
Actually you're banned and coming here while banned is breaking rules.
Yes Ayumi, you've done plenty wrong
You've done a lot of things wrong
"Punk"?
=P
What's he talking about now?
7I say he doesn't understand the past-tense qualifier, meaning that since he was /banned/ the action is in the past, therefore not directly affecting the present.
Excuse me? No,
7Lol
7You phail at insults
7n00b
FU.
7And trust me, I can do a lot.
You provoked me to.
7Now.
And why is he still here?
You people want more drama or something
?
No, I did nothing to you
13Rawr
7Aicebo!
Be quiet.
13Woah wait
Look up
Again.

Why is no one banning it...?
Don't trust me?
Hahaahaha

You might actually kick Ayumi.
He's still here.
Maybe.
He's devoiced
No worries

7My brother's 18, and 5 and a half years older than me. He's never beaten me in a fight (I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point).
where is the stupid fill tool in photoshop?!
Blarg
7Stormy: If you want to fill something, turn it over to paint, fill it there, and then put it back in Photoshop.
>_> Seriously?
7I hate Photoshop, much prefer paint.
hmmm... I'll just use fireworks I guess
7For colouring things etc anyway.
(I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point). Lawl.
Paint is somewhat limited with the filling thing
I wish i had a brother. Instead I'm stuck with an entirely female house and I'm unfavored. :P
Why aren't they teaching us photoshop instead of fireworks.... D:
7Brb
14Hi all
hi
Hi DarkCyndar.
14How is everyone? :)
Annoyed at stupid photoshop T__T
14LOL!
14Which version?
Umm, CS3 I think
14Ah I have no idea on that one
14I use Paint Shop Pro 3
I use GIMP usually
But these school computers don't have GIMP =P
GIMP isn't helpful, IMO.
14lol
Paint serves more of my needs.
7Bax
And I thought it might be helpful to learn photoshop in case I feel like spending a fortune on it some day
Hai Kayjay
14I stick to PSP3 and AS3
14brb
No

O R YA?

WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO POINT IT OUT TO ME WHEN I DON'T CARE
You inferred it.
No I didn't, you assumed it.
Nothing useful to do. :P

Too dark/Cold.

-BE TRUTHFUL. This means, when she asks you, "Does this look good on
me?", It's okay to say no. She wants the truth.
*Slap*
O_o
I think that's a bit stupid, of course they want you to lie to them in situations like that.
*just want, reassure
Because if they say yes, it means nothing because they could easily be lying
SR you should have gave them that quote I said
I'm trying to remember lol
Deranged Dr. Remehov.
I got a laptop
No, she has a laptop

Yep
I've always wondered why do Americans (I say Americans because I think it originated there, not sure) say 'Mom', with an o?
Yeah
Rather than with a u?
:P
I haven't heard anyone say mum
Mum is actually less like the ENglish language.
Not really.
The proper English language is strange.
Is it muther?
No.
With random irregularities.
Such as the past tense of dive being dived, where as Americans made up dove.
But it is incorrect. :P
Dove is much less awkward to say
Well, here at least.
DFOKN FOR MODERATOR!
:P
I think the UK is incorrect.
And you are wrong.

If I have to delete it, you must admit that you hugged SR in public.
2After I'm done.
But I didn't.
It would be a lie.
The evidence says otherwise.
The evidence has been tampered with
My name is Christina!
DragonFireOKN: Edit this one then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cwO8Ng2x74&feature=channel_page
Anyone can tell if you scroll up that I never said that
And anyway, even if I *did* say that
Can you prove that the evidence has been tampered with.
It's just text
:P
Admit that you had intent to hug SR in public then.
I believe you've hugged Abbey before.
Or Cyndar.
But I didn't.
It would be a lie
No, the evidence proves that you did.
Want me to get my own evidence?

My toolbar is actually useful and not annoying.

13Is that it puts rrandom sentences from webpages into the search thing

4Probably banned there
I got banned from DarkSpyro in about 2 hours.

12Yeah.
It's pointless
Basically another spam forum

4I don';t RP anymore...or, as much as I used to
Terminator sux
4pretty much, I wanna see that fourm get removed JUST to see people's reaction
Things: How does he learn?

<Magma> Has anyone actully killed an elite enemy
<Magma> Does that mean yes
<Magma> Got to go bye
I was playing the character the other day
7'the character'?
13Why-Is-Nmode-Off: LOL
when you said things about spyroli
7Who?
7Hahaha. Yeah.
13No you didn't :P
7We believe you. Thousands wouldn't.
I know
Oh, and
I'm telling this now because she is not here, but don't go spreading the word
I know about the photo and that she's nopt 16, nor 10 nor 9
7Mmhmm.
she is way older and is trying nowt to show that
7Right. She's /not/ nine. I TTLY believe U!
13:P
Too much things that you wouldn't believe
I see I can't make you believe in the truth of the fact
7No dude, look up, I can see the word gullible up there.
I'm saying is that she can be somehow 30 or around that, and she doesn't want to show that
Cmon, are you crazy?
7She is nine.
13"she CAN be"
13There's a difference between can and is
13:P
And I could be 69.
13And how would you know if it was her, or if it was her parents? Jeez
And I am.
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
13yup.
I liek to lookz at childrenz!
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know even if she is really her
I got proof that she IS liying about her age
Show me proof
7I've got proof. You only need to read ANY post of hers to see she's in the nine/ten/eleven agegroup.
Search for the member HanliSmith123 on spyroforums, and then look at spyroli
13Kjakings: >>
7Aicebo: You're the exception of the rule, you know that.
the two members have diferent birthdates
13She could've just put random ones, you know :P
13Jesus.
7Brazilian_Spyro: And? I accidently set my age to fourteen when I joined. It could be a mistake, I've corrected it now though.
That's why she is lying about her age(s)
13That's not proof.
7Walk us through it, step by step.
Is someone here moderator of spyroforums? (if they can see Ips)
13I am :P But no I'm not hacking.
You can't hack someone with an IP address...
No you can't
You talk BS.
With her IP address, you could find approximately where she lives.
13yalp
13Nope
Or send packets to it, on ports.
Although antivirus usually blocks random packets.
There is a program called VNCViewer
Doesn't work ^
I said to her to download it
Not exactly
Yes exactly.
Well most trojans.
Why would she let you?
You talk crap too much.
Assume the position%#%^@@$#~@@##$
Because I'll get all the information out of her this way
I'm pretending to fall on her trap

7It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:<
It took 3 hours to look that up...?
D=
Wow.
YAAAAAAAAAAAY
7Not literally three hours.
7Twat
7Considering each lesson is only 50 minutes too.
Don't exaggerate then.
:)
It's not nice to call someone that, KJA
It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:< That is why I am taking spanish for modern languages
7On topic? It's not a forum idiot.
It's about french lol
You have topics.
Idiot.
I have one way to annoy her
7... I'm done talking to you.
Because I win?
Mua mua mua muaahahahhahahahah
You lie... YOU LIEEEEEEE^~~!%^@#^$*~!%*
7Yahoo: Tell me, then give me everything you have on her.
wyndon_torque: Ignore him
http://www.mibbit.com/up/oU4oJ8yP.jpg
Dunt click that

7If you're going to ignore everything I say on the subject Yahoo, I'm not going to help.

Anyway.
I'll be back alter.

You know, this would be one of those things thats best done in PMs
/me administers 40 lashes

I bet everyone hates you ALL the time, KJA

*working
I can't see him being female really.
Yahoo: Yes it works
Because he has eternal PMS
Thank you
Looks cool too
Thanks :)
I prefere it with music
I would show you the one with music but it is annoyingly slow
that font is really hard to read though
Yeah ^
Yeah, it doesn't even have any punctuation
but thats just me, I think it gives a little more "edge" to it.
Then you don't have to watch it 3 times trying to read the text.
Its an intro, it doesnt need a next button
just make the font more readable and maybe consider a different text animation style
http://www.deviantart.com/download/111025270/CaS__CoTL_PREVIEW_WIP_by_YahootheDragon.swf Takes a while to load with the music
A mistake thats made is playing music with lyrics other than whats displayed on screen
O_o? ^
lightning*
7Pirate flag?
Lol
......maulteasers
Yahoo: Also, preloaders FTW. :P
..brb
Wow! That was awesome, Yahoo
...
One sec.
I displays fine in XP
It*
I have a preloader file somewhere. O_o
Not slow at all.
I wouldn't blame IE
mcname._xscale=(_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100;
That's for a bar ^
And
If you want text under it, with percentage loaded
textname.text=Math.round((_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100)+"%";
Then to stop it leaving that frame, unless it's loaded
if (_root.getBytesTotal() != _root.getBytesLoaded()){
gotoAndPlay(1);
}
That's it.
...wow
...is that dari lol
Yep.
I should of guessed
Yes, you should have.

3Yeah, I just realized that they existed
7LOL
3Were they available yesterday too?
7They may only be on today, although there's some speculation that they're here to stay since not every egg is one.
3Hmm
3Btw what's a frilled?
PAHAHAHA RURIK XD
3If you wait I'll be able to breed you some frilled.

4yup
13You don't "save" any.
13Besides
4it's a good thing he doesn't live about....10,000 years ago lol
I can't believe people say "Ooooh, BUUURRRNN", that stereotypical American diva phrase.
13It's not like they're born and killed right away. They're raised, then slaughtered. Food is food.
I can't believe people actually say*
say wha?
4hm
4eh...who gives a damn
I R VEGITARIAN DRAGON!!!111!111
ME EAT TREEZ
hmm
13"Oooh Burn" is such a phrase for immature little children in elementary school.
I also can't believe that people say "Tres cool"
Ooh burn
13What's that mean
13Ahaha
"That is just, like, tres cool"
Tres is very in French
yeh
13That's dumb XD
i've never heard it
Stereotypical American blonde (Insert dumb before blonde if you want, but I don't think it's needed)
really?
i've been around some blonds and ive never heard that
Which is why it's stereotypical.
?
explain that
...
13...
13How old are you?"
why is it stereotypical if ive never heard it from a blond
4hm
a predetermined judgement for some group of people
Exactly.
4heheh
It may even come from movies.
4it can also be the ultimate shield for people
People have said it on here.
(Americans)
:P
ok then... maybe i missed part of the conversation about this
4one of the reasons why society sucks as usual
pesimitic hmm
13hmmm...
*pesimistic
4nah I just tell the truth
13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4 0.0
Yeah, I like to think of myself more as a realist, than being pesimistic.
I don't create illusions.
4I'm a realist by far
I tell it as it is.
15............
4problem is
truth can come half full or empty
13RAWR
One word.
:P
4I could care less if it is
I know.
4on here I don't give a shit about my spelling lol
But I still like to correct people.
Yes, I am.
4Only place I care about it is in my stories that's it lol
14.
>:^V
4what's with the dots lol
14wanted to show I'm here, but I don't have anything to say.
4ah
4for crying out loud
'Ai
4hm
14prince-dari you're just arguing semantics now
its about perseption
13I'mma brb/bbl
6hello guys
6hello guys
4Nothing I just like saying things
14.
BenevolentFacade: Yes, but the I perceive it is on facts, not whether I view a possitive or negative view on things.
the way*
6o_o This was a bad time to end up signing on xD
6gtg bye
thats just being blunt
4hm
not whether I view it in a possitive, or negative way.*
/me burps
then thats being indifferent
() :)
4being a realist is easy
And how can you be indifferent on whether a glass is more empty, or full?
You cannot be indifferent on something that is a factual aspect, such as that.
4and you're not afraid to tell them
being realistic is one thing but to word it as you dont care how the person reacts is a little indifferent
4Depends on the kind of realist you are
this is about perseption not being honest
My logic is undeniable.
Looooooool
if i'm not concerned with something i am indifferent if i have one position on something then i have an a position
are we talking about being honest or the way we perceive things anyway?
Terminator: My logic is undeniable
...
yes because you dont care whether it is half full or empty.. thats being inderrent
*indifferent
Yes but this isn't about whether I care if it's half full or empty, it's about whether I think it's half full or empty
Whether I care if it is half full or empty is irrelivent, I still have an opinion as to whether it is half full or empty
LOL
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
if you have an opinion then you do care to a degree
Not really.
For example.
hmm
is this about morals now?
4human ideas..morals...actions
4how you think
Although we argued for hours.
I won in the end, he gave up.
4so lol
4what have you proved?
MY LOGIC IS UNDENIABLE!
4humans are humans
4we all act the way we do
4and trying to figure out why and debate it really doesn't solve anything in the end
14if you're going to keep using that phrase...

10AHHHHHHHHHHH!
13XDDDDD
4kek
I just noticed I had mustard all over my hand after typing for 20 minutes
13XD
but strangely enough none of it got on my computer.
10BORED
13hi
10hi
4hey guys
13XD
4cause you were the only one to mention my name
Its faster to type "red" then hit tab.
13lol
4heh
4I like my name
4hm
I like everything about myself.
hmm
4certainly not a bad thing
"unauthorized usage"
hmm
4I get that a lot
4another reason why I hate cards
i hate credit
Just ATMs piss me off.
i got a debit card and i dont like paying these fees every time
13lol
heh
;)
whats with terminator
I don't even look at the fee screen anymore, its worth it whatever it is.
4all I keep is a debit card
13RAWR
10Wah
>:^X
Only thing I don't like about my card is that it has a $300 daily withdrawal limit via ATM, and $500 limit daily for purchases.
i dont like the 500 limit either
yeah, keep it open until I'm sure, in accordance with my master's thesis on the Legend of Zelda
wtf
But i'm too lazy to verify and I don't have a US bank account and I don't have another credit card
I could use my dad's but it doesn't look too good when you have other names attached.
Plus id have to get him to phone Visa and ask for the pending charge for verification.
limit of 20 transactions a day
which means I can't buy anything good without making multiple transactions and most places won't allow that.
hmm
i just get charged $5 per deposit, a dollar per transaction, $5 per month, and have a limit to $500
daily limit?
total limit
i cant put more than 500 into the card
oh that sucks
I have a bit on my card right now, but no limit
i dont buy much over 500 but i still would like to
heh
i hate that crap
i think paypal is about as paranoid
paypal sucks
I don't use paypal anymore.
No
because mibbit needs monies.

There is a misplaced apostrophe (SP?) in Lots.

Or, it may only be in the poem bit.
The letters in the poem are...
o______o
LOL
Good point.
First letter of each word.
Wow.
First letter of each word in the poem put together = "Black falcon"
Wow, I haven't talked to him in ages....
Yeah, after you said the name, I could work that much out. :P
No need to explain.
I didn't think he'd still remember me XD
Lolololololol
Right

/j #lol
?
?
Yep.
Definitely.
You gunna tell him then?

7Dari: Maybe he'll make her a 'video'?

No, it wouldn't be worth it

I'd just delete the thread, hahah
7Then I'd PM sr with a screenie of it.
7HAH
OK, you do that =/
7Dari: He's probably going to make her a 'video'.
"video"?
o__o
Interesting theory, but I don't think SR can read my PMs on Neoseeker =P
What's B&G?
Oh right.
7I said I'm not going to explain it :P
I worked it out.
Bill and George, with their comic things.
7That was a phail.
7Majorly.
7Dari, you can't trick me into explaining it. Besides, while we've been arguing I think Stormy's escaped.

I physically shook my head back and forth when you said that.
7Meh. Too far, you're on the ban-hammer handle now dari.
Not really.
(left and right, not up and down.)
I don't think SR minds that much.
7Of course, banning you would just prove you right, and neither of them want that.
When I told him he could watch it at the telly, he threw it at me
=P
LOL ^
7Stormy: He can CLAIM he doesn't care.
Proof please.
/me 7runs for the hills
I spent £20 pounds for nothing
...
I don't understand /why/ I would care in the first place
I just think he's a lazy arsehole
lol
*Cough*Jealous SR*Cough*
He wont sit in the same room as me or in a proper chair just to watch a 90 minute movie!
I avoid doing anything at all with my family.
They annoy me.
7:P
7Or whatever his name was
falcon
It was blackfalcon
I don't.
They pay for everything.
7:D
You're good.
I never noticed that.
7Stormy: You mean SR.
7Also, Yahoo, it's Wall•e
Whatever, I'm pissed
He suggested to use the misspelled words
Well I thought if he spelt this badly, it had to be on purpose. O_o
I think it was sent as a prank or something
hahah
Just a typo
=P
:P
I did say it's probably in the poem afterwards though.
I think it was some kind of prank, though
Why don't they just sell silicon? O_o
yup

me too
Bbl, nosebleed
Lol ^
Yeah it is.
I know, because I used to get them.
I haven't gotten a nosebleed in like 3 years

We need to re toilet train Terminator now

6al they know is to surrendor
France waits for the almighty deo to cleanse them?
4no they just suck at waging war lol
4their is a difference :P
4ah that reminds me
6XD
The thing I hate the most about the USA is that it thinks it is above and beyond everyone else.
It thinks it's the police of the world.
It's not.
It isn't above anyone else.
6no offence
It's the feeling lots of people get.
6nope
4btw here is that thing lol
4the military history of france

6is crap
4read it lol
6they loose everytime
6lose
6XD
6yeah
XD
4oi
6no in a good way
4yes believe it or not
4not all Americans are idiots
:O
4even though their are now more and more
:P
Yikes.
6yes i knwo that now
My views aren't changed at all.
4the foundations on which this country was found have long since been betrayed
6lol ok
My view is on America as a country (Yes, I know America isn't country), this is not my view on individual people.
4I'm in no mood to get into politics lol
6yeah i knwo but i thougth i would say taht last thing
6lol stupid george bush XD
4This nation has been going downhill for years
4and it's only going to get worse
6and hopefully 4 u it wont carry on
Apparently America still owes Iran money. O_o
4all they do is sit at home and live off welfare
6yeah but i suppose as technology seems to do most things for em they do taht
4nation of complainers and lazy people
6yep
4nobody has work ethic
6i think it went downhill 4 u guys when it was Vietnam
Maybe it's good that we're going through this economic crahs, because it'll make people ahve to work again like back int he old one.
They all seem to think that going off to fight for their country is such a good idea.
6XD
*crash, have
And they all think that from such a young age.
4Some people actually do believe in the principals this country was found on
When they're likely to get blown to pieces before the month is over.
It's horrible.
4they are just becoming less and less
6i used to think that as well as some other things but ive learnt not to generalise americans anymore
6not america as a country
6but as individuals in america
6has done great things
4Well here is one example...without America by this point Isreal would have already nucked the middle east....and therefore necleur war would already be upon you
6 4 example
How?
Because I think that's BS.
4Then you are just as niave as most Americans I have seen
6lol XD
4you truly think that the Israelis are going to tolerate the arabs when they come after them AGAIN
4that's just like that BS Raidon was trying to talk about
4seriously...if the world erupts in neclear war
4we wont be involved in any way
4yeah that's just idiotic
4"All we have to do is stay away!"
6well to be honest i still think u would be first to strike after someelse attacks
6no offence but its just my gut feeling
4The whole world has access to these weapons
4the world we live in is a very very scary place
6yeah i know
6or
4and all they need is the right push to go over the edge
6they choose not to recognise it
4The average American is now an idiot
4that is the truth
4they could care less about the world outside of thier own
*realize
4they have no freaking cares for anyone but themselves
4and they would most likely be correct
4the only thing now is
4WW3=goodbye world
<RedDragonX> you truly think that the Israelis are going to tolerate the arabs when they come after them AGAIN
4go watch the movie Fail Safe sometime
I don't think they would nuke them.
4Then you are again niave
You've hardly stopped the fighting.
6fighting over the last oil fields in the middle east
4as in every sinlge one of them
How do you know that?
4yeah they would sooner wipe out all of them then let that happen
You can read minds?
I doubt they have genocide planned.
4and guess what...they have even attacked US...there allies to prove the point they don't want to be fucked with
4and go look at history sometime. The freaking crusades have never stopped
6UK and US troops fighting there
4History is doomed to repeat itself
4and things have not changed
6they failed
6and now UK and USA are going in again to fight
6its just gonna be a repeated failure
4much like others
Explain then,
4not like I can change minds
You have given no proof.
13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG
6i think he is finding the proof
6told ya
4and people are now niave enough to believe that nothing is going to happen
4yeah that's complete bullshit
6so basicly we are just going to repeat oursleves history wise until some1 wakes up
4if you say you are such a realist then see the realism already presented many times
discussed*
6best not ask
It isn't realistic.
4yes it certainly is
6here we go again
Is*
That isn't realistic.
4'oblivious'
That is total crap.
4hence why you are niave to the reality of things
4it's written all over ancient and modern times
4and things have not changed
4and start living in the real world
I am.
talking about the history of the arabs and Israelis?
6sort of they are
*spangle*
4I only see the common sense in things
6and here comes more proof
I haven't really seen any proof yet.
Oui
The Arabs always break the cease fires.
because thats how it has always been.
Well they were thrown out of Palestine. You can hardly blame them.
4thank you for helping prove my point
No worries.
4no point seeing as how it doesn't matter to most
4what happens happens
The simple solution would be to drop an atomic bomb on Israel.
4yup
4"advanced"
Israel has no problem getting rid of the Arabs.
4nope
4they would be glad to do it too
4if their is nothing left to buffer the two
Well I say Israel should get bombed.
why?
4peole say History is useless....when it offers the most important lessons
Since the Palestinions lived there first, and the Israelis were terrorists before they moved into Israel, basically.
They attacked loads of people.
6whoever is oposoing them
6think about we would if our countries were being invaded
More power... give me MORE POWER*@%^%$
6joking
6oh britain
6cause britain lost the war
4the Jewish peole had Israel to begin with
4During WW1
4they divided the country in two
4to begin with
4one for the Arabs and one for the Israeilis
I fail to see how the Arabs are at fault at all.
4The point at hand was that it was there land to begin with!
4the ARABS didn't want it
4they wanted the whole land
4not just half of it
4because the Arabs wanted everything
4and of course the jews kicked the shit out of them
4are you kidding me
...
Well basically they got kicked out of their country.
They are attacking Israel because they want all the land.
Yes, but it was all theirs in the first place.
4WHEN IT WAS THE JEWISH COUNTRY FROM THE START
...
4Israel was established as a safe haven for Jewish people
4and the ARABS DIDN'T WANT THAT
Yes, but the Arabs were living in Israel before the Jews.
And basically got chucked out.
4they could have had half of it and instead chose to kill more out of it
Yes, but there was no conflict for them in the beginning.
It was because they had half their land taken from them.
If occupied America (Not possible, I know), and then decided to take half of it from them Americans, and give it to someone else, how would they feel?
4That does not justify their actions when they have the entire rest of the Middle East to play around with. They want the "holy land" just as they have always wanted it. When the Jewish peole were given the "SMALL" piece of land as a token for their suffering the Arabs refused to have it
Well I think the Americans would fight against them.
4they fight over one piece of territory that has no meaning
It is still half their land.
Now THAT is not justified.
4the Arabs are only escalating the problem as they have always done
I feel like I'm about to vomit everywhere.
4that's BS and the Jews know it
No.
You wouldn't.
4they have no strong reason to fight for the piece of land only that it is for their own religious beliefs...nothing more
4other then that they could care less about it
As I said, it is unfair to TAKE land from people, whoever wants to give the jews the land, should supply the land, from their own country.
Now that is BS.
4no that's the truth
That's just an assumption.
4you just refuse to see it
And it doesn't matter WHY they want it.
4"time"
6to be honest let them selves sort their own bloddy mess out
It is their land.
In their eyes at lest.
4and the Jews believe that as well
least*
4so welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven problem
Yes, but it is not the Jews land.
Nor was it Britains land to give.
4and they deserve to have it
6It wasnt just britain
6actualluy
If you feel that way, why do the Americans not give the Jews a piece of land that size.
And boot out whoever is living in that piece of land.
See how those people feel.
6teh un has to decide
That's not the point.
The point is that they wouldn't do that,.
The point is that if you shouldn't take someone else's land from them.
4and the Jews responded by freaking booting the Arabs themselves
Yes, but it wasn't the Jew's land.
You fail to see that.
4The land has been contested for thousands of years
4the point is the Arabs refuse to stop
The Jews never lived there.
4even when all the Jews want is to live in peace
You didn't answer any of my questions.
Because you can't.
4that's all they have done besides the Arabs freaking attackign them
Because should you answer them, the answer proves I'm right.
4Yes I did you just can't freaking read into anything
4It doesn't matter in the end because it's going to go on
4and you think that it wont in the beginning
4so you have already proved my poibnt
4"point"
4instead they wanted to kill
It wasn't the Brittish's land to share out.
And the Arabs are not to blame.
Put it this way.
6well it was going on 4 a long time beofre britiain did
Is it right for the Brittish to go into America, take a piece of land, and hand it over to the Jews?
6no because we know taht is wrong
Just answer it yes, or no.
6No
4The land was divided by the UN when SEVERAL COUNTRIES had claim over it..they simply put out a simple solution. Share the land or don't share the land
4and the Arabs didn't want that...they wanted Everything
Yes, or no, RDX.
The Israelis had no claim on.
Just because their religion involves that country?
BS
Total BS.
No.
I can't.
Total BS.
I think thats an invalid comparison.
I am not talking about the problem at hand.
I am proving that this is not the Arabs' fault.
Because whatever the reason, you CANNOT justify going into someone ELSES'S country and taking some of THEIR land.
You seem to ignoring that I am not talking about the problem at hand.
I am talking about whose fault it is.
Who's fault is it?
Whoever decided to split the land between them.
6im going i can't bovered to listen to this any more
Brittan?
The point of the debate is who's fault this is.
6cya all
6oh and nothing is goign to solved y pointing the blame
6bye XP
I don't care how it can be solved, because for all I know, it can't.
It won't be solved.
Thats right
4and Israel is certainly gung ho to defend their right to live
Who's fault is it?
I never said it was.
Whoever gave them the land?
I said it was the fault of whoever split the land between them.
4we have proved nothing except points that have no meaning
Britian's fault?
Basically.
4the UN
4everyone is at fault in this mess
Well yeah, mainly the UN though.
4they are not afraid to do it
Well, I enjoyed that, RDX.
They have no problem annihilating the arabs.
Thank you for the debate.
4no problem
4they have a right to live just like everyone else
Gunna go watch TV for a bit.
Cya later.
4they would sooner kill themselves then let the Arabs do it
Back.
4wb
Thanks.
4I have the sudden urge to eat ice cream
4we don't have any...
4damn it
Meh.
:(
4hm
4I should have gone to the bank today
4It's fine man
Just some of the things America has done.
4Every nation has done things man
4nobody is innocent
4it's all a power struggle in the end
Yeah...
4but their are good people in this world
4they are just much harder to find
4who knows
Because for some reason, I doubt we'll make it all the way till the sun dies.
4true
4the world has simply evolved based on truly selfish reasons
After something like 300 years, all traces that we'd ever existed were gone, virtually.
The last thing to go was the huge dam in America, I think.
4Hoover dam
4well
4if it does happen it happens
4the most we can do is be the best people we can be every day
4in the end I do see the destructive nature of some humans to be our undoing
4trust me
4that there is
4I can only go with the law of averages
4well
4so all we can do is live for today
4and not worry about tomorrow
4just be the best you can be
4the only thing I would feel bad is for future generations
will*
Yeah, the world they inherit won't be much.
4if anything
4we can't
4which I highly doubt
That would be interesting to see.
4we are driven by selfish goals now
4but we can only dream
4all we have left is bettering ourselves
Well I suppose everything has its time...Ours has to come to an end too...
4every great empire falls
4mainly through it's own means
4"its'
Such as the Romans spreading themselves out too thin. Got too greedy with land.
4the best example is the Romans
4they worked together to achieve a free and ethical society as a Republic
4everyone wanted it for themselves
4and eventually they collapsed through their own selfish desires
4and I like to see the lessons that it teaches us
4every great empire is doomed to collapse
13...
is*
4but then again religion is also one of the many reasons why the world is how it is now
Yeah...
You would have thought that as their religions are against killing, it would stop them.
4no
4they have simply used religion as justification for their cause
4and hence we shall always be divided
4perhaps it would be?
4who knows
When you think about it, religion does cause a lot of problems.
Yeah.
4at least we wouldn't be waging wars because we believe one cause is just over another
4personal rights have now become the most dangerous weapon of all
Children having too much power.
Children have too much power.
In earlier years adults had too much power, children were abused too much.
We need a balance.
But how do you get the balance?
I don't see how you make a balance.
4you no longer have the balance because people have been encouraged to act this way
4in America 200 years ago
4after the revolution
4every American worked hard for a living
4they were good and just people
4and then the politics took effect over time
4but now today
4because they have been spoonfed their entire lives
4the children become the adults
4and they act the way they were brought up to act
4which in today's world is not giving a damn
4no work ethic because they have been encouraged to be lazy
4and hence the average person is a moron...and a jackass
4hence why I am the conservative I am
Well no solutions which are possible or likely to happen.
4there is no solution except for people changing their ways
4and the way things are now heading that's not going to happen
Technology is also a problem in a way.
4because the government has done nothing but encourage laziness and bad ethics for years
4and yes Technology is a problem
Our weapons are getting too advanced, too dangerous.
4Technology is good in proportion
4if we know how to wield it
4which in today's world could mean our destruction
4the same goes for the younger generations
4and just sitting there using it because you are addicted to it
4without such distractions in our lives
4even if you did survive
And the easier you make it, the lazier they get.
4yes but like I said.."technology in proportion"
4if you know how to control it
4then you are fine
4you have to know where the balance it
4"is"
4and you have to master it
the problem with many things is finding the balance though.
4yup
4many are content to feel good by direct means
4instead of enjoying something by bettering yourself as a whole
4because people are too lazy to do it

10ok
10fair enough
"Silvaze: They're both the newbies, and they belong together. 1200/10 (I'm not a fanboy.)"
Lies.
He's a fanboy.

Uhh...
13:/
4ehhm
Technically...Although we don't actually talk about Spyro much.
10true

/me 10stops
/me 10stares at Fresh_Blood
....
Oh right.
10Even my jokes are funnier than that
That hurts.
10Ive never been good at jokes, sarcasm on the other hand...
10Sarcasm is one of the higher forms of humor
Heheheh.
10Care to share?
10The whole trilogy.
10lol
6HEh
10What's wrong with the trilogy?
10Everything.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I just think people hate it because they replaced the old games with them.
Although that's insomniac's fault, for dumping Spyro.
10Mary-sues, cliches, button-mashing
It's not button mashing.
It's too easy.
:/
10I hated the old spyro, far too americanised, no offense
10Yes. It. Is.
/me 10twitches
10.....
13How is it Americanized.
/me 10twitches again
13TLoS is more cliche and Americanized.
10and the cocky attitude?
That's not a reason.
10Dari: No! Really? Wow... really?
It's part of my point.
Read everything I wrote and even you may understand.
/me 10headdesks
10well the legend trilogy brought me back to Spyro, Id grown out of the older ones
10cant stand to play them now
6Most people seem to believe it is, Dari.
It means it's faster paced and more fun to play.
10thats not the point they're making
10Whenever you are able to press and random buttons in any combination and still manage to beat the enemy, I consider that button-mashing
10*any
14Bah
10here here
10not here here to the 'bah'
10the one above it
...Meh.
14Like I said: Mary-Sues, cliches, button-mashing
A 5 year old can't play it, it's 7+ :P
14It isn't.... fun
EMBER?!?
10How is it Mary sue?
I mean come one.
come on*
14No
14Elora
14I hate Ember and Cynder
4oi
4Elora was nothing
Ember is still technically part of the old games.
Elora sucks.
13:D
4the faun
10oh
DragonxFaun = PHAIL
DragonxDragon = Win
13Prince-Dari: Yup
10I know, ember and flame...thats about it from the old games
4supposedly
10wow...really?
10how strange
14A Hero's Tail and Enter the Dragonfly were abominations
4eh
4that they were
ETD especially.
14No... match... at all....
The loading screens...So horrible to remember...
4gah
4it was junk
It's still in my house somewhere.
I think I locked it away, after I couldn't sleep with it being in my room.
It's scary.
10you're talking to an Eragon/Saphira writer
4I don't care about the inter species junk...if you like it that's fine lol....I just go with things that kinda make sense. And I didn't see anything to really back up the relationship that made sense
4they pretty much just through it in htere
4"there"
14Isn't...
14......?
Their anatomies don't fit.
It doesn't work.
10at least as far as I remember
4it's different for some gamers
14At least the first three games had great gameplay
10i changed him back for a time
Yeah, still.
14I know there's no point in trying to "convert" anyone, but I like a nice debate once in a while
No one to talk to.
10How is Cynder a Mary Sue?
The end of DotD was FAIL.
Total FAIL.
10or ASpyro?
I have to say.
Dotd = EPIC PHAIL
6Dari: Where exactly are you coming from with that, hmm?
It was total crap.
Does anyone mind if I use spoilers explaining how it is total crap?
Anyone here?
4they left it open for future games
This is supposed to some epic battle and hardly anyone dies.
10Ithe same thing wouldnt have happened
6Actually, no, the same thing would NOT have happened. More than likely, the remaining peices of the planet would have just crumbled, and everyone would've died
10no one has yet explained to me why they're mary sues
4oh I'm sure she is typing something
10who
14let's see... Dramatic past: CHECK
14 Hackneyed mannerisms:CHECK
14 Special Abilities: CHECK
14 Ostentatious: CHECK
<Zephyr-kun> Actually, no, the same thing would NOT have happened. More than likely, the remaining peices of the planet would have just crumbled, and everyone would've died
Explain.
How the same thing not have happened?
6Easy
14repeated too often
10example
14She's always saying about how she "doesn't belonog"
14*belong
10did it once as far as I can recall
14*snort*
It wouldn't have crumbled.
I think not.
14She never laughs or smiles (that one time in ANB doesn't count)
6I highly doubt the ancestors would be able to do much more than they had.
10by someone else
Catabatus: It's the same thing
14I'm not even going to call it an island, since technically it isn't
BS
10they didnt take him down
...
Technically they did.
14:P
4if he is that would ruin it
4as far as we know he is only imprisoned again
10he's been told that by several people, and said it once I think
14Cynder: She's always moping about her past and all the terrible things she's done
4didn't see him actually die
14And when she isn't going through one of her "emo phases" she shows no emotion
14at all
Because surely he can escape again.
He would be more angry I would have thought.
14brb
10Nor does Spyro, personally I think that was bad casting, not character traits
Lol, heheheh.
And why would this be the "Dawn of the Dragons", if he was just imprisoned.
4we don't know any of this unfortnetely lol
4always fun to make assumptiosn
Not really the "Dawn" of anything but more evil if imprisoned.
14They hardly thought out their character traits
4"assumptions"
He was imprisoned before, and had loads of minions.
4What? lol
How did he do that?
4I'm only stating the truth :P
If he did then, why can't he do it now?
14They are
4As far as I know he isn't imprisoned in Convexity anymore
4he is imprisoned in something in the center of the earth
4"minds"
Simple.
:)
4who knows lol
4I don't know
Or the pressure.
4you don't know
14*ahem*
And if he isn't destroyed, what's to stop him breaking out of the centre of the Earth?
10Explain that point again if you wouldnt mind
4maybe the spirits of the guardians imprisoned him in an alternate reality lol
Either wya, I win.
way*
...
Now that's quite unlikely.
4I really don't care lol....I didn't even know I was the one arguing this
14Sparx get's over it.. eventually
4it
4It's not good to YOU
Might as well sit back and let the ancestors do it all.
4not everyone is you lol
10she doesnt think everyone hates her, she doesnt even once suggest that
14*cue "awww"
14She does in the beginning of TEN
4he.....he....heh......what? lol
4and no she doesn't
4she only says that she can't stay here
4never directly does she say because everyone hates her
14I know that not everyone hates her
4"accept"
14That was my point
She says that she doesn't belong there.
4She does in the beginning of TEN
4?
4 you were claiming that his statement was fals
4by saying that
She just thinks that her place isn't there.
10exactly
10now thats just childish
4and now you just randomly say something different lol
10i thought we were having a reasoned argument
14We are
Reapsond?
4as far as I know you stated that she claimed everyone hated her....and you said that she stated that at the begining of TEN
Respond?*
4then you say that that I was trying to prove the exact opposite?
4nah that doesn't stound right
14What? No.
14My point was that not everyone hates her
4you denied...then acknowledged his point
14She THINKS that everyone does
14Oh, forget it
10that was my point
14TLoS is screwed up
4haha
10lol i see that there's really no pointi in me continuing this argument
14Yeah
Catabatus: No she doesn't
She thinks she doesn't belong there.
4h
4"hm"
14And why doesn't she think she belongs there?
Just because I don't think I belong in America (Eurgh America), does that mean that I think Americans hate me.
Because she remembers the pain she has caused them.
14No one cares
14Except for Sparx
It doesn't matter if they care.
10thats not the point
10she cares
10its her guilt
She can't take how nice they are to her.
10so she leaves
Allowing them into their home, etc, etc.
If you killed someone's child, by accident, how would you feel if they invited you to stay at their house.
Could you>
14Meh. There's no point arguing with you LoS fanboys
I doubt it.
You would feel too guilty.
10lol if you had good points then Id change my mind but you fail to put them acroos properly
10I am actually
Would you be able to?
4he is defending his points lol
...
14Not at first, no
10Now ,see if Id killed someones child I wouldnt be able to sit and eat with the family even if they did forgive me
Exactly.
14*trying to
I agree, Fresh_Blood.
I wouldn't be able to.
4hm
10i was actually defending Spyro too, you just shifted it to Cynder
10and its dragoness, not She-dragon
Let me give you an example.
14Oh, exuse me for not using the proper term
He never finds it, and dies.
14Even though dragons don't exist
What's the point of the film?
It ruins it completely.
10Not the point lol
Why watch the film? There is no point in it.
14Dari: Yes.......
14And may I ask where you are going with this...?
10Who?
4wait...what are we talking about now?
14Who knows
14I say we drop the whole thing
4hi
14It's pointless
14Hi
4what thing?
4no point in arguing something that you can't win lol
6And hi
4lol
6Brb
No, but there a loose ends.
14There is no finishing it
4doesn't matter
10every argument has an end
14It's an argument based on opinions
There isn't much of a struggle in finding it either.
He's just searching round this island.
14Not necessarily
4-.-
14Well, I'll tell you this: You aren't changing my opinion.
14And I know that I'm not changing yours.
Actually, that's agreeing with me, Blaze.
10i can damn well try lol
4lmao
4kk dari
4persistant as always lol
4I found it quite amusing lol
14You would
14:P
4lol
Completely different arguments, coming from the same one topic.
4me 2
10I'll be coming back for more, thats for sure, that was fun
6That is quite amusing
4yeah....
14Of course, we all interpret things differently
14Thus creating opinions...
4man enough with the logic lol
It was that in certain situations, logic can be opinionated.
I dare you to disagree.
Well.
/me 14is blown off her feet by the sheer force of Blaze's statement
14...
4gah
4I hate two reds
14That's worse
4for being a complete moron
14RedDragonX: Yep
4yeah that was pretty fun
/me 14grins evilly
4I have to admit
10Is... is teal open?
10no
4lol
10lol
6Neither is purple >: D
How anyone could argue MY logic there, I don't get.
10its not opinionated, some just interpret it differently
Yet he argued for THREE hours.
14Heh
4I AM
4Red be my color :D
4that all
4alright lets try
4...
How you interpret it, is you opinion on the data.
12Blue?
10There is only one truely logical choice. To you everyone elses is illogical.
4blue is good
6I can agree with that, Dari
14Quote: 20:32	Catabatus	Of course, we all interpret things differently Thus creating opinions...
12not taken?
There is only one logical choice in a situation where you have all the data.
10On second thoughts I retract my opinion.
10Logic is opinionated
/me 14hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "babe" and "gal"
He seemed to think, that in situations where you do not have all the data, you have an opinion the data that is given, and create the rest of the data from that, meaning that there is only one logical answer.
10human logic is opinion, mathamatical is statistical
4why? lol
10I cant help it
Catabatus: I've just filed away all that for further use at later times.

14 20:49	 	Blaze looks at cata(insert gay name here) and shakes head
14I'm not going to forgive him. He has to earn it.
4lol
He can't earn it, every time he speaks (types), his terrible spelling and grammar drives him further down.
4no need to
4wish I could have booted him myself

14And right now, you are very far from earning it
MrBot: It was snakes and ladders, of course.
Not right now. why?
10lol that's good, I like it
13Blaze: You did not "practically bow to everyone's feet". You insulted me and harassed these members. Saying you're sorry without meaning it is nothing.
14Figure it out for yourself.

damn...hate it when that happens
Lol

You mean forgiveness.

14So you'll still have to show me you're as mature as you say you are
14But I suppose I can lighten up
13Blaze has proved that he is not mature.
He apologised.
13So?

4well at least I'm not in the freaking stock market lol
10true lol
Hahaha.
10dont want another wallstreet
Yeah.
Loooool.
4that's why you don't put money where you can't see it
Oh wait.
O_o
10lol yes
4christ it's simple
4if you want to handle money right
10I earn 1% on my money in the bank
4use one bank....one debit card....and deal all in cash
4that shit is going up
10for now
10but it is a safe investment
4I don't invest in anything
4I keep my money where I can see it lol.....and keep it safe by my own means
10I used to keep mine in my safe...now its in the bank earning me 1p a month
4freaking credit cards lol
10i use debit cards
4I use one debit card
Americans are invading...
4that's it
10well yeah, one debit card
First they want to build a missile base, but it won't stop there.
13...
4he already promised everything and can't deliever...I'm sure he would be glad to help lol
Then they'll start building army bases around the UK
10He'll be assassinated soon
Then when they have enough people, they'll take over completely.
4well
10before the end of his first term

13blah.
4seeing as how I'm a member of the military that's not something I can really talk about
Lol.
10doubtful
13brb
My last message wasn't aimed at you, by the way, RDX.
10I'm moving to the moon, no one owns that yet, no taxes
4what do you think people would do? lol
I'm going to hide undergruond?
underground*
4well I can just see the entire world going nuts if Necleur holocaust is upon us
4"nuclear"
10It wont come to that
10none of us are that stupid
4not us
4but you have no idea how many stupid people are in this world
10it'd be mass suicide
10on a global scale
4this world is already at risk of that
13back
4everyone has nukes now
4all it takes is one little push
13bah
10wouldnt do them any good though, a nuke is only good if it can get you something
Nukes are such a bad idea. :/
10They're unusable weapons
4well let's go back to WW2 lol
3weapons of mass destruction are threats
4we wanted to end the war quickly and let the Japanese know that we could kill them at any time
4and they ended it pretty quickly
4now everyone has access to them now lol
10two bombs was a bit unnecessery though
4it was global war FB
FB>
FB?*
10But still, one bomb would have got the job done
10you werent trying to wipe them out
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ysQE9MKaz0 these girls have no lives. Oh well.
4and maybe one freaking ship destroyed at pearl harbor could have told us to back off?
4they wanted the war over
4they didn't take any chances
10And wiping out one city in one second is different to one ship in several minutes
One good thing at least.
4They wanted to end the war and they made their point...arguing about why they dropped two is pretty pointless. They wanted to get the point across
4shutting down Gittmo is a bad idea
4unless they find a place for all these prisoners
4which they have yet to do
10I know, its pointless to debate now, that's just my opinion on the matter
10open up alcatraz
They don't even get a trial.
4more then the vast majority of people in that prison have been involved in terrorist acts...or suspected of it yet refuse to talk
4but we don't have a place to put them
It's disgusting.
4if they refuse to talk then they just might know something
You don't know if they've done anything.
4and that's enough to put them in the risk factor
10paranoia simply
4and yet they might have
4so it can go either way
4but if they suspect someone
4so you are going to accuse us of acting badly because we want Americans safe?
Hah.
10I believe this topic is starting to border on the line of offence here
Any crazy American can get hold of a gun.
4Every time you need a fall back you go onto nations as a whole
4every freaking person in that prison has been a suspect
It's not a fall back.
4they are in the risk facotr
4'factor"
4they might know something
4and they wont talk
Everyone is a risk.
4so we are right to assume that they do
No you aren't.
4the problem is
3wow...
10what if they dont actually know anything?
4and they have yet to give a response
They should release them.
Most are innocent.
4ummm no
Uhh, yes.
;)
4um no
10what if they dont actually know anything?
4I don't know where you get this innocent shit....most of them are all freaking guilty
4they have been arrested and sentenced their when caught fighting against Americans
They have not been proven guilty.
4when America does nothing
4everyone in the world complains that we dont' care
4when we do do something
4everyone complains that we are murderers
If America doesn't poke its nose where it doesn't belong, people leave it alone.
But America has to interfere.
No one wants America to do anything.
4and pretty much most of the time we poke our noses because someone complains about it first
4and we were attacked first
Hah.
4these facotors are far out of our hands
You go into countries that don't want you there.
4goverments are governments
4we go into countries that would sooner harm those around them then help people
But the fact that you support that BS makes me angry.
10To put it simply every country is ruled by an indiot, can we at least agree on that?
4and the fact you are a freaking la la liberal that can't see the truth in matters makes me angry
I suppose.
It isn't the truth.
4yes it is
10none of us have proved anything except for the fact we cant remove ourselves from the argument
4just like the fucking Israelis and Arabs lol
4I would rather see that then have them free and then do something which is a huge possibility
How can you expect me to think that to be right.
4it was their fault for not talking in the first place
They aren't given a trial.
10How can you telll the diffeence between the ones that dont talk and the ones that dont know anything?
The Americans don't listen.
4we can't just let you go
4we found you engaging in activities that could harm this country
4we have eevery right to detain you
4but you wouldn't sit there and let me insult Britain just like I can't sit here and listen to you insult America
It's not even in America.
4we have every right to suspect them. If they don't talk that gives us every right to assume that they know something we don't and that puts them in the risk facotr
But that isn't even damn well in America.
They have no right to be there.
4we are there for a reason which I said earlier
4the Cuban Crisis has forced us to keep a presence there
America sees terrorists where there are none.
4we don't exactly find Communist countries american friendly
4and how do you know there are not terrorists there?
10I think communisim isnt all that bad
4there are terrorists in every single country
4and many of them would be glad to freaking launch a nuke to display their ideals
10I still doubt that
10scare maybe but never use
America is paranoid about terrorists.
4do you not see how sick some people are today?
4and we are not suppose to be?
4okay
4so we sit here
4do nothing abotu it
4it's okay to do something
4but wait...we do
4then the world calls us murderes again
4for actually trying to act upon it
4then the whole thing starts all over again
And by going into Iraq, they just made more terrorists for themselves to be attacked by.
9-11 was a while ago.
4they attacked the towers twice
4and succeeded the second time by far
4and ever since 9-11 there have been no attacks on us
Exactly.
4because we have stepped up the fight against them
Yes.
4and that's where it matters
And got loads more Americans killed.
4because we keep our people safe
Well done.
You've achieved killing thousands more Americans.
Rather than have very few Americans killed in America.
4and through various other reasons
Not more in one year than died in Iraq.
4this isn't even a war
4it's a police action
4and yes more in one year
4would you like the figures?
Fine.
4on average
http://www.antiwar.com/casualties/
4casualties and deaths are completely different
4and I can go into various other factors that kill poeple in America
4car accidents are just the largest one
4and that's each year
Terrorists being one of the smallest.
4but the ones that shouldn't happen
4because we did nothing wrong to die over fanatical religious beliefs
Finally....
4because we have no right to protect our country right?
4oh yeah I forgot we are not suppose to do anything
4nevermind
10Aduro, dont expect much, they arent even aware of us anymore
4and I am aware of you lol
4sorry
They wouldn't.
4did I not just say religious beliefs?
4ummmm terrorists hate us
4ALLLLLAAAHHHHHH!!!!!
4then they blow themeslves up
4good for fucking you
4you get 72 virgins for blowing yourslef up
4and going to see Allah
4and taking innocents with you
4and that's how they are trained
4that killing yourself in the name of Allah is the greatest glory you can ever have
3....
4and they want to install fear in our nation by taking innocents with them
4that's the whole point of terrorism
4they want us to fear them
Well there would be VERY few deaths from terrorists if America didn't intefere.
4and not do anything against them
America interefering with them
4so you are saying if we just sat here and did nothing that terrorists would no longer attac k
They wouldn't have reason to.
4what a freakign moron
They wouldn't.
10what is it the terrorists actually want?
warm
4Terrorists always have reason...we didn't do anything before 9-11 did we?...they attacked us because freakign Osama Bin Fucking ladin see's Americans as the greatest disease
The newest recruits, thanks to America going to Iraq want America out of Iraq.
4They were recrutinga anyways...and they always would have!
4they attacked the towers two times
4the first for no reason at all
4the second because they wanted to fucking send a statement that we were a disease that doesn't deserve to live
10I cant cope with any religion whatsoever....appart from maybe budahisim
4The Terrorists would still be recruting no matter what...and they would still be attacking
4they proved that when they attacked us for no reason whatsoever
<RedDragonX> the second because they wanted to fucking send a statement that we were a disease that doesn't deserve to live
BS, how do you know thart?
4the important factor here is they are over there
America is always doing something.
4TURN ON THE NEWS ONCE IN AWHILE
4Our country got involved with others why?
4because they wanted us to
10Osama hasnt been in the news for quite a while
I expect that there was a reason for the 9/11. (Obviously I don't mean a justified reason, I mean a reason in the eyes of the terrorists)
4and ever since then people have wanted us to bail them out
3-.-
4and that reason was that they believe Americans were evil people
3....
BS.
4seeing as how their leader SAID that
4please enlighten me
4the whole freaking world heard it
4he televised it
4and they have it written out
Get me an exact quote.
http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/frontpage/seattle_pima1x220041030.pdf
4and that claims right there that they are more then willing to die for their religious beliefs

America interefered.
4They blamed us for the interference when it was in there hands to begin with
How?
4they didn't accept the deal
Yes, but they shouldn't have had to accept that deal.
13back.
It's all their own land.
4the deal that seperated Isreal into two states...giving Jersusalem to both halfs
It is their land.
4btw Jordon and Palestine were not nations before that
13Are you freaking kidding me....? STILL?
As I said.
If they keep out of it, they won't get attacked.
4So he didn't like it because we played a part that was only our part....becasue we gave the Jews a piece of land they refuse to yield as always
4they could just as much blame you for it
4or the Jews
4or freaking French for all they care
13:/
...
4they go after America because we are the strongest
4they fear us the most
America interefes most.
13ugh
America causes them the most problems.
4we interfere because people complain when we don't!
4again back to the beginning of ww!
No they don't.
4WW1
4and WW2
13..............-_____________________-
4well let's see
4WW1
4the French
4The Russians
4exactly
4and we gave it to them
America didn't help until it was attacked.
4we "interfered"
4this is WW1
4not WW2
Whatever.
4did you know
They asked for help.
The Iraqis didn't ask for help.
Yes.
4and they let it happen
4to get us in the war
4because they would have been overwhelmed if we hadn't
4so you claim we interefere in everything
4when most of the time we are either pulled into it or they complain if we dont
You only intefere when people don't want you to.
When people to, you don't do anything.
Sit back and watch the fireworks.
4Well Osama also admited that he had ties to Iraq
4so that gave us every reason to go in there
4that and Saddam was fucking nuts
BS, most of the terrorists weren't in Iraq.
4his sons were nuts
America placed Saddam there.
4then why did Osama admit his ties to it?
I don't know, tactics?
4the low and behold we removed him
4and his nutcase sons
4and we still get blamed for it
4they have a free democracy now
4what they do with it now is their own business
America removed him because they didn't like that he wasn't listening to them anymore.
4and that was not reason enough to go in there?
When he was killing people and still listening to America, they did nothing.
4that was a different presidency
It was because it didn't bother them.

Although we decided that not to tell him.
Aduro is a heretic and a blasphemer.
Aduro has no place in the Brotherhood of Makuta.
Aduro sucks ultimately
3Aicebo wouldn't tell shit to me
All he talks about is FanFiction
He can't talk about anything else
It's physically impossible for him

7Once, and this actually happened, the Simpsons insulted Fox News pretty badly, and Fox News was planning to sue the Simpsons, until they realised The Simpsons is OWNED by fox.
13Haha SR
7I could think of some ways
7Unless we're talking on something we both agree on lol.
Some fugly annoying chick that I knew in like grade 6 likes to tell me how shes moving back to BC...
13LOLOL fugly
Hahaha I just made myself laugh
[14:25] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: "might" be moving back, and its not a shit hole, its just, very...very...Oh fuck okay whatever its a shit hole
7What did you say in grade 6? Because I know you're itching to tell us :P
One day I told her she should be a lesbian because no guys would ever date her, then she told me she had a crush on me until I said that and that she hates me now. That was in grade 6.
7That was an epic win.
I (a) insulted her, and (b) made sure she would never like me again
13wow
13haha that's mean
13XDDDD
13brb/bbl
[14:29] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: which reminds me, are you gay?
[14:31] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: are you being sarcastic with me?
[14:32] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: HEY! no need to get personal! didnt mean to piss yeah off! gosh, you sure can be mean
You're watching the Family Learning Channel. And now, angry tics fly out of my nipples!
7Aicebo, you still got those pastebins with the Ignitus232 tricks?
<Aicebo> brb/bbl
[14:36] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: there are three ways i can answer that, one is to Agree with you, but then you might come back with a mean joke or get mad. Two i could not answer and then you would get mad or just not say anything else, OR three disagree and then say something or get mad, like #1. whcih one should i choose,

13"Don't you understand pig latin?"
13:P
Heheheh
10I figured it was that and no, I dont
It doesn't really work with punctuation at the moment though
fresh_blood: Put the first two letters at the end, and add ay to the end
10I know, It just takes me a while to work it out
Hmm
Let me see if this works.
Someone speak.

That's pretty annoying
Yup
He's a sponge I tell you, a sponge!!!
oh great you going off about the marshmellow theory already lol
Hm
or sponge theory
Oh yes
sponge/marshmellow theory
I have a cake/caek theory...
It cant compare to my sponge.marshmello theory, mine is airtight
It isn't about Spyro. :P
Then whats it about?
Cake/Caek
I dont understand
Let me find it.
I know.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Lawl.
therefore it makes no sense
lol
I know you can't make atoms.
It's not meant to.
I can't stop eee-ing
That's why it's MY theory.
Shameful, at least MY theory makes sense lol
Mine isn't meant to.
Therefore it is made of win,.
Light doesnt exist in atoms...
hm
...I cant grasp things that make no sense...
No one should be able to grasp it.
The point is that no one understand it.
mmmmm breasts
O_o

It's looking more like a 12 year old AOLer all the time.
Hmm
Good idea
How can I make it remove all punctuation...
Add at least 5 exclamation marks after each sentence
Ok
Yeah, that's really annoying
Lawl

Fresh_blood's comment...
Really? I think we all get slightly less sane each time we come on here
I SPEAK NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
You're talking to the wrong person about sanity...
He's a marshmellow I tell you
How did you come to that conclusion
AHA someone's actually got me to explain why. Give me a sec to collaborate my thoughts
I have actually taken to eathing miniature marshmellows
Hmm
Have to hve
You're eating Spyro's babies!!!
oh lord....
AHHH

Thanks for the slap by the way
:)
/me eats all the Marshmallows in the TloS series again
w00ty
If you cant disprove a theory then that theory is the one believed until another theory is put forwards. Therefore every person here has to agree that Spyro and Cynder are Marshmallows
Netsplit

...
Pig latin?
Yeah...
Hi
I have 3 different settings
One that reverses everything you say.
One that changes it to pig latin
And one that changes it into 12 year old AOLer language.
It isn't a script.
>.>
It's a button on a menu.
o_o
Pff, like I know the difference =P
And technically, SR said I wasn't allowed bots...
He never said I couldn't have the odd user script. O_O
I don't care
Lawl. :P
Lol @ Fresh_blood
You know you're just going to get a bunch of little kids whining at you for insulting Cynder
I havent insulted her, everyone likes marshmallows
I don't.
:P
Hmm...What a good idea.
Oh crap
it's a good thing Aduro isn't here now lol
That can't be good
D:
ZOMG! DID U SAY CYNDAR??!?!1?!!!!!11??!?!?!!??7!?
Hahahaha
Do it
...
Verrrry perceptive.
Terminator: Loooooooooooooooooooool
Even the bots have me sussed out.
Wow.
:D
Of course now I need to think up strong defenses for my theory for one someone tries to dispute it
Yeah, I'll put it in. :P
They're talkibg about Twilight on TV! HIDE THE KIDS!!!
*talking
OMG TWILIGHT
I LUV EDWARD

EDWARD IS MI HAWT SPARKLY VAMPIRE!!!1!!!1!
you honestly think the developers care
easily lo;
NO MINE D:
MY EDWARD
and you're ruining my argument, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON MY SIDE!!!
/me hisses and spits in Stormy's face.
I was just offering my opinion lol
/me unsheathes her claws.
/me rips Stormy's limbs off her body
/me throws marshmallows at Catabatus
D:
*destroys
I fail tonight.
I was just pointing out that I'm pretty sure the developers made it that way because they didn't want him to take damage from falls lol......anything we assume is just our imaginations filling in gaps
hahah, OK, enough of this :P
Heh
...we all know that the developers did it...but where's the fun in that?
The fun is a lie.
...
:(
it's realism lol
Cyner and Spyro are now and ever shall be Marshmallows until someone absolutely destroys my Theory.
sorry I'm a realist :P
http://edward-cullen.net/ Lol
....
they....
Read the comments; they sound exactly how Catabatus and I did earlier :P
They did NOT...
"LUVREDWARDS: I LUV EDWARDD LUV HM"
"Giselle: he is THE hottest vamp ALIVE!!! he is SEXY!!!!!!!"
He's alive?
I didn't know that
=/
Vampires are undead.
Oh wow
That's just sad
lol
Ha ha I have followers
lol
I shall spread my theory till its known everywhere
I cannot stop laughing
I should come here more often
Lol
Hm
O_o
Does it remove all my punctuation, lol?
No, apparently not
hm
This is weird, lol.
One sec
OMIGOSH KAWAIIII!!!11
Example?
Eurgh, no, I don't think I could handle that.
Haha
Why Cynder has such an annoying fanbase
Lol
Lol turns to "lululul", lol.

(yeah, I watched some of the cutscenes from DotD because I can't be bothered to waste my money one the game)
However that works
/me doesn't own DotD yet.
Hey SR
Hey
You're making a comic of that?
Awesome
psstt....this would be one of those times where Zero would freaking be usefull
Zero?
zero

Zerodius
Uh huh
I know of Zero, but I dont know her
Her?
Zerodius is a girl?
and she it's a she
I think I'll have to draw it on paper and then remake it on Photoshop...
Wow
I never knew that
gah....she even drives me nuts
I think me and Zero could come up with some very interesting theories to the inconsistances in the Spyro univers
Hmm, also I think I'll change really to ORLY
Oh no...
I'm sure you guys could
not serge...
If you think Zerodius is bad....
Zerodius is a chick?
Nothing compared to Serge
one time I at there for 5 freaking hours...while she ranted on about how all these games were linked
He would go on and on about his Spyro theories to me for hours
She wont post on it
/me hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "gal" and "babe"
On MSN
D:
why not?
She get's me on gmail -.-
because she doesn't post on the forum much anymore
LOL
...
and she is under a different name now
shame
And he keeps sending me "<3" and meowing at me
Hahaha
...
/me twitches
WTH?

Because it kept signing me in randomly and he would contact me
Lol
Wow, this is REALLY annoying

kek
he is prolly on there more
Hai
He roleplays on MSN from time to time
...
O_o
Eew roleplaying
he is still doing the roleplaying?
I hate roleplaying
with someone else
jeez I thought he was done with that
At least I think he does
he never did change his name back
well his name hasn't changed on gmail either
still that.........yeaaaah
No, his gamail is the same, but on MSN it changed
not like he needs it now due to the recent events
depends on the girl
I dunno, a stripper?
Lawl
I'm terrible at buying gifts for people
:P
Fresh_blood: Me too

A gift card?
Money?
Yeah, go with a gift card
Money is no fun, gift cards suck
Or cash
well gift cards do always work lol
Cards = fuck-coin.
Everyone loves cash
=/

I don't know
I haven't seen her for 3 years

you guys are screwed lol
I probably am
and a nice card
Haha, I never have this problem
or just get her something id like.
lol
No one likes me IRL =P
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-259949.html#259949

Catabatus: XD
Thanks a lot =/

Exactly
It's like a guilty pleasure
They're just time passers
I'm ashamed to say that I liked the series
I know a few girls like that
I think that's how Christianity came to be actually
Thankfully not too many
The movie was OK
Don't bother
You wouldn't be interested
I saw it once but I had to see it a second time...e__e
That thing's going on DVD sort of fast
I don't think I even want to see the movie
It's on DVD in March
If the book sucks, I hate to imagine how much the movie must suck.... D:
The movie was decent
Really?
They cut out Bella's crap about how "handsome and angelic" he is
Oh, seriously?
I might have to see the movie then
That was seriously annoying me
lol...
Stupid Edward fangirls....
OH
One moment..
I know one girl that read ALL the books a year before the movie came out

DID U SAY EDWARD?
OMGOMGOMG
She went to start bitching about the movie XD

It doesn't even sound that good
Even without Miley Cyrus in it, I wouldn't be interested.
Yeah
It's not mine
I seen that comic before
I wish I could take credit for its brilliance, though
But I fail at drawing people
I know its not yours
I'd favorite it, but I'm trying to clear out my favorites on my dA account
Why?
It won't let me delete some
I don't want the account anymore
Lol
I realized that I can't draw :P
D:

I was just searching the web one day, and stumbled on it, and NOW ITS STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD!

GAAAAAAAAAAAABE
i'd perfer power metal...thank you
Bleh. Metal.
I despise pop, metal, "punk" and rap
such as Rhapsody, or Dragonforce....
Real Metal = WHITESNAKE + FASTER P***YCAT <333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
lolololololololol
Heh heh heh
Oh no...
I can share with you, my personal favorite song by Rhapsody
Swaffy's on...
*cries*
"Wisdom of the Kings"
D:
S-swaffy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9wIs8roKy8
Live performance too...
....that's not metal
there are different Styles of metal
:P
That first one isn't metal...
Aduro: It was the FIRST METAL
FROM THE 80'S
YOU CAN'T DENY IT :P
Not the crap that y'all listen to today
yes....but its not the metal of the Nowadays
Catabatus: HEY
>___>
*cries*
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-260170.html#260170
here's an example of the metal Nowadays
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvquWIULIFA
*to
Heroes of Our time, By Dragonforce....
...When I said that I was reffering to rap and "metal"
Rap isn't considered music
It isnt music, its abysmal
I've never listened to Dragonforce, and just by listening to that song I can tell I don't like them
I only like one Dragonforce song
its considered something between Poetry and Music....but its neither
I don't consider rap music either, I just - Oh, forget it
it freaking sucks ass....I don't know why it even exists
Not all rap is bad.
in all honesty...I don't like any of it...
I heard that song first....actually...before GH3
I said ''almost'
it died in here again
lol and unfortunately I have to go, might be back later though
*gulp*
Bye
I think
Later everyone, I May be back
with like 10 eggdrops
:D
Unless thats gonna slow down my connection to all fuck
He annoys me
Gah...
He annoys me, too
She got off
Let me check my messages
No reply

Most people know I can, you don't because you always run before I get to have a proper argument.
Right. Because you going "I win. You lose." whenever you run out of material, THAT's a proper argument.
*readonlywithcaution*

I didn't run out of material.
I wasn't arguing yet.

Well yes.
But I find it hard not to argue when you agravate me.

Probably because you leave before I get to respond.
Or ignore me.
I'm just that awesome. (Another dari response.)
I've only said that once to a n00b.

All americans like any food they cane shove down their gullets.
And processed.
I like to stick with fruit...fresh fruit

otherwise he has one sentence in there...he may of just had to leave for a moment
I was spazzing out in front of my TV.
And why?
My archrivals favorite College Hoops team went DOWN to a team my team beat earlier in the year by 40. :) :) :)
...Huh?
Hail is an Uber-n00b
SF55 is a friend of mine.

NO PROOF
-___-
ok
/me never acts 16.
Except when I act like a clown at Basketball games
Or when I'm doing MMA
i don't act like a 16 year old i admit that
i dont act my age
Best you start now.
I don't act my age either
-__-
I don't act like a 16 year old, I admit that.*
I force myself to act older than I am.
You can too.
I am sixteen, and I act younger or older, depending on the situation
Because I'm neither chav nor pike.
I would always guess younger for you, Aduro
There's no difference between a kid, a teenager, and an adult other than maturity. I'd much rather act older than be purposely obnoxious and have everyone hate me.
i wouldnt really mind if everyone hated me for how i wanted to be liek, its my choice
Like me
DragonFireOKN: I wasn't talking about looks :P
i'd rather act like that...but I usually act older...
its just that...I'm a Spaz
Not really. You always act younger.
/me combs his mustache
Umm, no you aren't.
I am the spazz of this site. A decent one.
I would never guess you to be 16, or older.
You don't spazz.
I object.
you just freak out about FANFICTION *lykomg*
=/
The biggest spaz is BY FAR Chanserv.
He always is acting up
Always denying me access

O_______________________________O
Not really, I'm younger and still have a very dirty mind.
BURN HER!
You........
You.........................
not in that way dari
Yep.
In that way.
Aduro: I'm younger than dari, and I have a dirty mind. Not to rival his, although it's close.
Aduro: No, you're 13.
But don't act it.
/me is disturbed in the head.
Things: If different colour light, travels at different speed, does that mean lasors of different colours have varying power?
Aduro: 13.
Aduro: You act like an immature 13 year old boy. There.
There's only one way to settle this.
I spent my boring school classes postulating how to murder someone and get away with it.
As the plastic is opaque to it lol
...Gas Laser...?
Yeah
DFOKN: You're all of the above, and then combined with me. Lol.
BUT
Wow. You left dari speechless. I WANT A GAS LAZ0R.
hahaha
Those are legit.
Aint really portable tho :P
I don't care.
:P
Clearly it has rub off on you
as you are acting like a drama queen
And the Rurikinja strikes again.
My IQ is 168.
You cannot have an IQ over 200.
Yes you can./
The highest is 228.
228? o_O
I don't perform in plays...I spent two years taking drama classes....
Mine is like....130? I just can't get it out
oh gotcha
Like if you were to ask me how to explain something, I couldn't
The average adult IQ is 100.
but I can liek show you
Magic
Meh.
Aduro: How can you take Drama classes without acting?
:P
I'd perfer not to be a Show-off about my intellect, Thank you.
I think I am onto something...
It still has extra energy. I would have thought that would go somewhere.
and you just proved my point
School
Ever think of that?
I'm not showing off.
I'm pointing out facts.
23:13	Rurik	and you just proved my point It's fun when people do that without realising.
If I wanted to show off, you would know it
A School's Drama Department....
It maybe does, but I don't think its substantial enough to do anything amazing
Not really any accurate way to measure it
!owner Things
Ha, you agree with me
Nope....I just enjoy writing
it relaxes me

13DragonFireOKN: I was forced to play a sport when I was younger and my parents always wanted me to play sports. I am a failure to them and a failure to sports because I think that all (basic/regular) sports suck.
4lol
13Sports are a waste of time.
4Sports are fun if you can do them and are willing lol
2You've never seen many sports.
...
13That's why I'm a failure to my father.

4I'll play any sport if we have the people to do it
2I played a year of Football in High School, Basketball, and.....golf.
4I like golf as well
4and snowboarding is my all time winter favorite
3I would play golf.....
2Crap.
13back
2gtg.
3but I suck at it...
2See ya
4everyone sucks at golf until you commit yourself to it
3I'd perfer dodgeball...although its not an official sport
golf*
3golf is actually fairly fun...
3ehhh
4it's not for everyone
4you really have to be patient with it
13bored...
3I like it, but actually going out and playing it is something I'd perfer to do when I'm retired...
4I enjoy doing it with my father
10Merlin's pants!
3WHERE IS HE!
/me 10is blown off her feet
10literally
3no...
3for about a year now...

10Bah. I don't understand why kids my age think they have to "date"
10Like Dimensional Spyro
3...
3I didn't understand any of that....and I'm more focused on getting this piece done...
10Cheesus
3-.-' hn....
4They should not be dating
4they have no idea on how to control emotions like that
4especially at that age
4it's idiocy
13Yeah
10Yup
4vastly different
4you should not even be doing it until you can understand it
4I don't even support it in High school
10Which they don't
13I would say 14 or 15 should be the youngest
10I think of teenagers as kids
4To me I don't trust anyone with the emotion until at least 18
10"Child" and "kid" mean different things to me
