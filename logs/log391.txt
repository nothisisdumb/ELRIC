Pirating is illegal guys
I know :P

how much does it cost per ep
It's piracy if you redistribute, right?
it's 3$ an episode
Once I get a job ill be sure to actually buy them, just for support :D
over 90000 dollars
05its illegal to upload
I don't mind pirating for "legitamite reasons" but I don't mind paying
3$ an episode on Itunes or 30$ for one season
05not illegal to download
05AND
$3/episode
05its only illegal to download torrents that contaion ILLEGAL MATERIAL
05it is not illegal to download TORRENTS
Lol^&

Good grief what've I returned to?

Or rather, after a certain amount of time they have to renew the copyright to maintain it.
Actually, it could happen
I got cracked terraria that never works

11,01Piracy is piracy, but companies that buy up and sit on IPs are another thing.

tHE hOBBIT is not Publi DOMAIN

Allo LC.
I SAY!
all these join/parts are confusing me
hi LC!

Companies are doing all kind of things to limit the publics access to things. Corporate censorship and all that.
The fact that I would have never bought it with my money is justification for piracy. *pirates Twilight*

11,01Good for you.
05WRONG
05oblivion didnt have DRM
11,01Good for you.
Certain DRMs are fine though.
I mean really
imagine my wrath when i found out that i have only a three install limit
i have explicitly turned down a free copy of Borderlands because it uses SecuROM
But the shit that says "You're offline, you can't play this game" is just too much.

11,01Snuffsis has it right. Certain DRM I'm fine with.
you know, getting games from torrents dont have drm
Hay, listen.
11,01Even SecuROM
and in all honestly, any DRM it uses is publisher made
DRMs are the publishers own crappy steams

05that user saying DRM stops piracy

hey guys i got an idea. How bout we take this argument...And push it somewhere else!
/me doesn't condone piracy but isn't going to berate it either. If publishers refuse to provide convenient services they kinda have it coming.

There is only a handful of games that truly are AAA titles, (according to me)

All math is Easy
Teachers just teach it WRONG
</3
"All math is easy" gtfo.
if teachers actually taught math in a good way, everybody would learn it.
I don't even like math.
It's not the students fault that they fail at Math
0_0 My tv just mentioned flank steak
LOL dken
yea, math is one of those things you can't teach that well
Mmm Mountain due.
When in reality math is nothing like that.
Mountain Dew, even, lol
Math is numbers. Go figure.
11,01I didn't like math until I got to Algebra.
They teach it that way because of the messed up school system
Nothing more
Math isn't repetition
it's easyy when you execute it, but I have no clue how to explain it
05go get him CK!
Well, it isn't ALL repetition
lifeblood of the gamer: MOUNTAIN DEW
The school system is here to give student cheap As. not teach children.

aherpity derp
0,14hey everyone
lali-h osaxy
Allo Saxy.
Of course it's not all repetition. But that's the method that tends to get it through to the majority.
ooo, ^ interception
hello Saxy
Hey I could totally figure out the length of this ... in 30minutes... or I could get a measuring tape
/me is drinking Mountain Dew as he types
Math is hardly philosophy.
Every single equation in Math was derived from one simple thought that led to branches of Mathematics.
Happines is just an illusion
Why else would I watch a show about brightly coloured horsies?
me once filled a camelbak with mountain dew at a gas station
See I hate this new-age trash that math can be taught through scrying and whatnot. Kill-and-drill is not inherently evil.
It just needs to be done properly.
0,14Chat seems...interesting.
In philosophy you must write an awful lot about nothing.
Math is only boring because teachers make it boring
Oh yes because math can be buckets of fun.
If every student thought math was fun, There'd be no pizza men or prostitutes
there is nothing streaming right?
Mountain Dew, Pedagogy and Existential Crisises
We need those people in Society.

0,14I'll be honest, I don't like math much
anyone wanna chaaaange that? *looks around*
I mean mature chats *stupid euphamisms*

Walkeed into gas station, filled camelbak with 100 ounces of mountain dew, paid$1.65

LEARNING IS FUN KIDS
Again, you haven't explained how.
Math is fun. It's like solving brain teasers
I didn't go to school because it was fun.
BEST CAFEINE HIGH EVER
sure math can be dull, but it's the only subject that I do good in
Think of Sudoku or a cross word Puzzle
Learning sucks
You just keep saying that and hoping repetition makes it stick.
11,01I aced algebra 2 - intro to discrete theory.
wasn't the U.S the first in education in like the 70's?
You use a set of rules and you find an answer to it.
0,14with a burning passion
11,01FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
it's just like Baseball or HALO 3 and whatnot
lol
I hated math. And English. And everything else.
You have a basic set of rules and you use them to solve the problem in front of you
*structures
0,14Discrete Mathematics
Guys, I got to go, someone apparently broke into my sister's house.
/me goes into Vietnam Flashback mode
No, you haven't said much of anything, really.
Lol
Wel.
We need pizza men in society
Maths, philosophy, pysics, computing and logic they where my bitches in education
You just keep insisting it can be fun but haven't explained HOW you make it that way.
Which leads me to believe that you have no clue how to make it fun.
I just explained it to you
I learnt calculus in one lesson
All i saw was a load of rambling about sudoku and such, not how to make math fun.
The fun is in using a set of rules and applying them in solving a problem
i'm failing algebra
Which makes you identical to my professors in college. Spouting off a lot of nice ideas but no substance.
Math sucks
lol
0,14Beep boop son
math is FUN
0,14beep boop
trust ME GUYS
Methods.
I use to hate math too!
and now I have a 97 in calculus.
Also, quite honestly, a subject like math sohuld have to be "fun" for someone to learn it, people should just get their asses to the classroom and learn it.

I think they were kinda split on the subject.

0,14simple, CK
Anyway
I have had a few teachers that seem scared of the students, those are bad teachers.
Bahaha.
yea, the kind of fun that isn't annoying, which I have been getting too much of
0,14Stable their butts to the chair, duct the mouths and then teach
0,14XD
Tutoring's a pain, but I see students less often.
I can tell you this: I've seen attempts to make math fun. The kids HATE IT.
SIT DOWN AND STUDY!!!
*yay*
/me smacks student
if you want them to learn math, get someone else to teach it to them. someone that ain't a teacher, yet stills knows about it. i, for once, got extra-lessons from my cousin for a time. really helped me back then
Personally my approach to fun is the same as it was in school, ignore everything in the classroom and go kick around outside.
yes it is for me
Math isn't fun. I am decent at the basic algebra, though
mmm. Math doesn't "click" with everybody.
Reyes RANDOM NERD!

fifth time i see that today
More Derpy overreaction. woohoo.
11,01I complain because it's a bad idea.
11,01It's publishers trying to get more money they don't deserve.
oh

/me Guild Wars 2 looks really good
and a foldout poster
11,01Hell, the gaming community is partially to blame for publisher BS.
still
XD
11,01They complain but don't take action.
laters chatroom, I have that thing called sleep to do, smell you later
11,01Case-in-point, COD.
Borderlands is best FPS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwvUQBOnW6o&feature=related
/me waves goodbye
a'www I missed Dken?
^
11,01^^^
because you're free to that idea
But, co-op.
See that right there? See that piece of garbage you're defending? That's why publishers can get away with selling you shit. Because you'll still buy it.
11,01I played co-op once, but it was with high-levelled people.
I modded my borderlands profile.
/me shrugs
/me only uses sheild mods on Craw
never anywhere else
11,01Publishers get away with things mainly because not enough gamers react to publisher BS by not buying their games.
/me plays some WOW
unlike some games
11,01It is an issue about supporting developers under a bad publisher...
cough*cod*couhg
11,01Developers are becoming casualties.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHziLuIDRzM
/me said it as a compliment and a insult but mainly as a compliment
WoW is ok... i would play it if it was more, you know... free
^
Alas.
GEARBOX IS BEST DEV
11,01Lol CoD.
bc was ok
CoD sucks
0,14I'm looking forward to mainly fighting games this year
lol map packs
VERY loyal to their gamers
I really just want to watch the next episode.
If there's a problem, they FIX it
dat Saxy, fighting mod!
0,14XD
i am looking forward to Fighting is Magic
^
11,01Elite was created solely for making money.
/me played a lot of WARCRAFT 2
back then yeah
0,14I'm loking forward to, Blazblue Continuum Shift Extend (yes, I know it's out), Persona 4: Area, Skullgirls
1,3WoW was good through BC and picked up a bit during Ulduar, otherwise it's been going downhill for years
0,14and of course, Fighting is Magic
0,14and oh yeah, the GGAC+ port
If there's one thing that's consistent in WoW it's people complaining that the next expansion is going to ruin it.
Every single time.
I'm waiting for Skyrim DLC and halo 4, that's it.
Mass effect 3 and eventually Borderlands 2.. That's all that I've seen that interests me this year.
/me thinks Blockland is Over-rated and ROBLOX needs to be erased from America's history
well the next expansion is being made just to make money
Halo. Now there's a really bad series.
1,3doesn't matter to me if it does, I dropped my sub about 4 months after Cata
^
when wow came out it was very nice, the universe and detail, the freedom it was great
>_>
BF may be dropped from my screen, too
^
11,01I don't hate CoD.
/me :) at mention of CoD fail
CoD is in line with HALO and Battlefield right now
I haven't played cod since 4
HALO > COD
loved it ever since.
No. You can debate Halo and Battlefield going downhill, but CoD's been shit for years.
COD > BF
11,01They whored out CoD.
Stabbing myself in the leg with scissors > Halo.
CoD hasn't really evolved at all
11,01I liked Halo.
11,01I know.
I loved COD 2 that was my favotire
all else is meh 4 wasok too
BF was at its best with BF1942
Is BF3 worth it for the single player?
11,01BF games to me are too frustrating.
I decided not to buy BF3 because of origin
^
I really want to play L4D now.
if BF3 has bad singleplay, i'm not getting
1,3Portal wa gread
1,3*great
Dat gread.
the sports games every year is BS, just do a roster update through a download
It's like the cod single player
Saxy you're missing out.
first time beating HL2 ep2 made me cry in the end...
i played through the story 10 times and it still amuses me
Anythng on.
0,14this computer's a netbook though
0,14so it's AAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS for games

Saxy: gt?
11,01That's why BF3 is sitting on my desk unopened.
0,14ThePretender317
11,01Because of a steep-ass learning curve.

SW Knights of The Old Republic was absolutely amazing
