11,02twilight_sprinkle: Ewwww D:
:)
:D
/me stares upward, it's getting frosty cold in here.... :<
Tomorrow.
11,01Saturn is going to hate me now.
D:
EH YO MYTHBUSTERS
I NEED YALL TO BUST DIS SHIT
13and wait til you see what's underneath
it's so...round
08,01i was considering moving to america at one point
08,01Nittany_Discord: why?
I take it the subsequent nukes were dropped at the base of the previous nuke's crater?
Nice hole
05only thign preventign em to move to america is the lack of health care
05me*
another crator
Woah...........
Thats quite a view :)
thats awesome
Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt, Mitt Romney Style~ Eeeeeeeey weathly ladies~
ITS BEATIFUL
Takes a while to type on here
Well then.
11,01Because I make calls encouraging people to vote for Romney.
13mystcraft
13is AWESOME
phones don't have tabs :I
13Wrek: the problem is you take money from people to pay for it
13that encourages people to not work
but the problem with free healthcare is that it usually sucks
13that too
Lately I've been leaving my phone on in my pocket and draining the battery haha
Everything sucks, that's basically where this is going.
i used to live in a country with free healthcare, and it was terrible
05but guess thats my opinion in the matter
Every system every politician and every way of living is failure at some point.
13most people would like the choice
11,01The US has government health care for seniors (Medicare) and low-income people (Medicaid).
/me misses important discussion
>important
Saturn: Republicans aren't EVERYTHING wrong with the U.S.
08,01HoodyNinja: i didn't say Republicans
08,01i said Mitt Romney
brb sister is taking over the computer again:'(
05twilight_sprinkle: its not horrible here jsut casue its free
05so i cant see that as a legit excuse
08,01Kandarihu: yes
Free healthcare can be just as good as the american one.
Implying the country isn't already crashed into the ground...
Main difference is that you dont pay.
We can't help talking about things that are seriously on our mind.
Red_Pegasus*
Nonsense.
11,0116 trillion and climbing.
/me puts some popcorn kernals in a pot and waits for one to pop
Positively nonsense.
I mean, I'd rather not talk politics right now, because I get heated.
You spend too much on warmachines.
We could EASILY afford it.
11,01Saturn: Not all of us are mature.
/me sighs and puts away his flamethrower
08,01it's natural selection
05anyways
11,02ALL THE COLORS
05once could aslo see it like this
lol
Not only is he a homophobe, but he's also freakin' rich. And he doesn't like poor people.
I'm mad. I made plans, and they're pretty much shot, now.
/me cowers with errone else for Sandy D:
I have to make sure my old man is ok :-/
11,02Gas is going to be cheap in the future at only $14.39 a gallon.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Aaaaaaanything happening in here?
Or are we ded?
...why we killing alligators? ;;
I refuse outright to vote for Romney.
nusic kinda fits the mood
Deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
11,02Besides, at $130-$150 it's still a darn good deal.
05SafariMonkey: because of their religious status
11,02Write it off as the cost for the games and controllers.
I see political discussion.
BA
Interesting time to drop in, I guess.
DUM
TAA

FUCK
11,02It's Nintendo's fault for a consumer buying their product willingly.
Yep!
05thats why i said without thew religion
lets all blame dinkleberg and end le conversation
05cause thats where their power comes from
DINKLEBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERG
Sigh... I'm bummed out over a lot of things, but I guess we all have problems.
/me blows an airhorn
13this is the first one i sent off
^
05i still cant see how a moneypool for healthcare encourages lazyness
SEGA is just lazy
k
13i go a bit of the opposite
Sorry phone kbd
13why should i work, i'll only be paying for other people
05i still gota work to pay rent, buy food stay warm. still paying taxes
13that doesn't make it okay
11,01Actually, should we be arguing politics in here right now when it's discouraged?
Pillows can't be robots
robots are not living creatures
The only way I can see the US recovering would be dictatorship...
13it is when it's free
there is no such thing as free
How? How does free healthcare encourage people not to work? They still need money for everything else, don't they?
You pay for it yourself
I like healthcare...
08,01over here, we have National Insurance
I would probably be poor without healthcare.
08,01it tends to work quite well for us
05which in of istelf is a crime iirc
/me is poked
Saturn us too.
oh good, politics are being discussed
/me dies
/me Explodes
People are coming from the UK to the US to get health care that NHS can't provide, I hear.
Mods are out only during the boring conversations

this never ends well
I'd rather pay taxes than go personally bankrupt beacuse i got a disease. lol

05Kandarihu: gotta be nice when i can spend my fortunes to get experimental treatments to a rare contidion
You mean insurance that most people can't afford? :P

[21:54:00] <Kandarihu> People are coming from the UK to the US to get health care that NHS can't provide, I hear.
"Pay us now, and maybe if you get sick in the future we MIGHT pay for it!"
11,01$2 million?
08,01yup

I don't understand why people feel the need to fight like that. =/
^
because teenagers :P
Even when I was a teenager, I never understood it
It's stupid
fighting is in our blood
^
We're violently selfish
The label "warrior" implies that there's honor involved
something didnt go my way...better fight someone about it
And there isn't. It's just senseless violence.
Just because it's in our blood doesn't mean it makes any sense
Doesn't make it right either
Polygamy is in our nature too, but that's against the law
Thats my entire point!

http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcht7aUQAv1ru5991o2_1280.jpg
no way around it
actually there is a way around it
dont fight
Honor is taught
We're animals. That's the right word for it
Animals fight
http://youtu.be/m0efX3B51dU
We fight because we are animals.
I like to fight only in videogames :D

o.o
It's be a shame if something were to hap- oh wait
>_><_< i didnt do it!
How behind is my stream?
this is why I use HV-solar panels
>playing it safe
Hah.
Darnit it raffle is closed already :I
Wait, isn't it dangerous to put a bunch of uranium cells next to each other?
that was really wierd
I'm looking forward to Pan's Labyrinth
I mean, don't they affect the output of all cells next to them?
Safety is for the weak.
^
Hmm... Nah.
he doesn't care, little cheaty cheaterson
Never mind.
Wow. That is a lot of bedrock.
o.O
Wait, shouldn't you use the other panel as extensions?
Huh, never mind.
How hasn't that blown up yet?
magic *snort**snort*
it wasn't turned on. ;)
give it time
speaking of time
I plan ahead.
lol
As long as it doesn't become like the Pokémon show.
Because education.
seems to be holding
OH COME ON
You were saying?
Ze sound of progress, my friend.
That was timing if I ever saw it.
Alright I'm hitting the hay
i was hinting at it
Goodnight everyone

And then it goes boom again.
inb4 boom
More ice?
put in ALL the ice!
idk
oh...it turned off.
damn. I was enjoying that
wasthat ...corpse bride ?
i never seen that film too
Maybe you've heard of a terrible place where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair!
dammit i should watch more movies!
Maybe you've heard of that mythical place called the Court of Miracles (Hello, you're there!)
I shouldn't have watched Hunchback from Notre Dame yesterday.
That is a film i have seen.
me too
that was one of my favorites
That looks a bit safer.
not sure if boom
why not
> Safety
pick one
i've got all this uranium lying around
lol
The kind that explodes all the time.
The one that goes Boom.
i used to
then the revamped the entire sistem
much more complicated now
Yeah, that was annoying.
I still make mistakes because of the revamp.
i just wish CASUCs were still viable
TBH, I was mostly going primarily EE.
The power level...
You could say...
It's high.
It is fairly high.
I don't suppose you can make snowmen automatically yet?
not over ninethousand but high
thats looking much more stable
He could take over the world.
Inb4 "You have died".
Ohey some Don Bluth
That music...
ahh pre-1.3.2
Isnt is from Anastasia?
The pumpkin couldn't be moved.
dis music
i remember it from one of sabersparks streams
OMFG, I have to see that movie again.
My inner child weeps.
Do svidaniya!
straight into a massfab?
nice
can't do that any more though
massfabs now wont accept more than 512
^
Didn't watched.
damn
watch*
It's one of my favorite Bluth movies
also, running that hot would damage you
ice isnt being pumped in fast enough
you need around 7 a second
for a maxed out casuc
put more ice generators in then.
and recycle the excess
If you get overheat, it means you are going to lose 50 DKP.
RIGHT IN THE CHILDHOOD >.<
ooh...
good pick
hey
Guys, czech Lion King's Be prepared rocks.
hi
That's all.
there can be issues generating the items
i think theres more than enough ice
You could even say you would have... ice ice, baby.
Hm, I guess my computer at home died
ohokay
/me still isn't JJ
Cool off.
seems he wasnt prepared.
You are not prepared.
oh haha
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
<3 RP
RedPower is the best part of Tekkit.
hi
hey
tekkit is a horrible thing
is it wierd i know the distraction song timon sings out of my head?
yo
they never actually ask for permission
cuase they always get denied
its why forestry got removed
Perhaps. But RP is still the best part of Tekkit.
Rp is its own entity
?
3 stacks of ice at each corner
XD

but it takes several stages
havent thought of that
hmmm
ahh is this where uranium was crazy expensive as well?
whoah
a laser on a chest?
i was able to make nearly a stack a second on one of my old servers
OHH, thats why i have no tin
1.3.2 can cross-dimension chunkload in SSP
havent played it in ages
they are expensive to make
but once upgraded quickly make back their worth
or a torch
?
omg :O
welp

Oh hey, Hercules.

FFFFFUUUUUU
today is a stressy day, but clusterbux if it's gonna get to me
Which annoyed me on maps that had tanks.
and Banshees.
Please, the Hornet was worse.
The Banshee has to go in for strafe runs.
The hornet was just "I'll just go side to side, easy to dodge missile pod rockets and I can have two guys with Spartan lasers on my sides.
Only good way to take it down was sniping the pilot, getting a hijack, Spartan laser or a Scorpion shot.
The hornet was in multiplayer
Although it was on Sandbox maps and didn't have rockets.
No, wait
it was Avalance
Avalanche*
Oh yeah, I think you're right. It's been a while since I've played H3.
It was.
I think it was the machine gun only version though
00,10it's a jackel
>_>
at least I got some positive Feedback on my Indian my löittle Pony Intro xD
They were right.
Tank does beat everything.

November 6th.
Rooster Teeth were able play Halo 4
Totally jelly.
I did, it was terrible unless you had a good team.
The team part.
Guass Warthogs, Scorpians, tonnes of lasers and rockets

My team was disconnected except from me

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAsrZslU2tY IT BEGINS.............OCTOBER 30TH!!!!!!!!!!!!
looks interesting
the trailer does not inspire confidence
it's essentially a comedy-sketch of "remaking films".
but thats been done before...
everything has been done before
Simpsons probably did it
Meh, I'll give it a shot. If nothing else it's getting away from the NC gimmick, as that schtick grew stale months ago.
also, the idea of a bunch of talentless hacks remaking famous movies was already done to perfection in "Be Kind, Rewind"
Yeah, sorry, I won't. I have only stayed on TGWTG for a few reasons, and they've eliminated two of them.
well, Linkara has more or less said he plans on going on for years
he's already planned out a Teen Titans retrospective month for 2013
