<N4X> Invi: How were the Abi Klausuren?
<WallDives> I'm back.
<N4X> Well Welcome back WallDives
<RAWRity> I did NOT see that coming.
<Cypresswolf|Work> hello everyone
<RAWRity> Like...wow.
<N4X> Hey Cypresswolf
<LadyAvenger> Ohai Cypresswolf|Work
<Ninjazz> Hey Cypresswolf|Work!
<LadyAvenger> RAWRity: It's so lovely :D But I want a Photo Finish one ;_;
<RAWRity> inb4 those things sell for hundeds of dollars on ebay.
<alexxm> hey Cypresswolf|Work have you heard about the derpy toy
<Invi> N4X except for math they were all easy. Actually, math was easy too, but my brain derped during that. We get the results at the 06.06.
<Cypresswolf|Work> alexxm: for comic con? Yes - I want one ^_^
<N4X> Invi : I'll just wish you good luck from now on and press both my thumbs :D
<LadyAvenger> It's gonna go for like elleventy billion dollars.
<alexxm> shame i'm in england Cypresswolf|Work
<Cypresswolf|Work> alexxm: is that a one of a kind or a limited thing
<Invi> N4X thank you :)
<alexxm> limited i think Cypresswolf|Work just for comicon
<RAWRity> I mean, I thought the White Celestia, Trixie, and Vinyl toys were gonna be it, but then...THAT
<N4X> Invi : How was the...mouthly part? :D
<N4X> Fuu what do you even say for it?! And I want to take English LK
<Midnight_Tempest> come on Ragna... kick Noel's ass...
<Invi> N4X it is at the 13. or the 14.6. I still need to read all 4 books ^^
<N4X> Lagna wins...
<WallDives> as long as the derpy plush/doll doesnt wind up like the Lyra plush.
<LadyAvenger> ...OH GOD WallDives
<LadyAvenger> MY FREAKING EYES
<WallDives> cause shit like that is why we cant have nice things.
<Invi> WallDives please don't remind me of that
<alexxm> Midnight_Tempest what thats noel i thought she used guns and wasn't like that robot chick form the first game
<Litwick> If Derpy does get a plush like that, I'm no longer a brony. Period.
<Cypresswolf|Work> Do those limited special comic con specials often find they're way to ebay?
<alexxm> WallDives that is why people think we are freaks
<N4X> WallDives : Lyra Toy?!
<N4X> WUT?!
<Invi> N4X don't ask
<Midnight_Tempest> alexxm: its noel in the continuum shift extend story, she was kidnapped and turned into Nu-12
<Invi> N4X you don't wanna know
<WallDives> N4X, dont ask, giggle is your friend.
<N4X> Invi : actually...
<alexxm> thanks Midnight_Tempest
<Litwick> N4X: It's a plush that's meant for you to fuck.
<N4X> O_O
<N4X> WHAT?!
<LadyAvenger> LA LAL LA Stoooooop ;_____;
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01you mean Mu-12
<Litwick> There I saved your time.
<N4X> bu...wu...why?!
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah Mu-12... i get my symbols wrong sometimes
<N4X> Was this actually by HASBRO?!
<WallDives> N4X, hell no.
*Ninjazz facehoof
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01was it really?
<alexxm> N4X to make people think we're freaks no someone on 4chan i think
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01I thought it was just a seam from the design and whatnot
<Viri> 14hi Nick
<N4X> O_O
<Midnight_Tempest> i thought it was just a large hand puppet
<RankWinner> Hello people, I be back from the hell known as pre-exam 'revision'.
<Invi> wb RankWinner ^^
<N4X> Hey you actually called yourself Lagna :D I approve of that
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01but eh
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01Furries
<Ninjazz> Hello RankWinner.
<LadyAvenger> Honestly, clopping to a pony? Please. That's kinda...nasty. o_o kinda gives a bad name even more to the fandom.
<Nick> hai viri
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< whats wrong with furries... im a furry...
<N4X> Oh pony I need some food to chew this see ya
<Viri> 14how is?
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01eh, I don't have a problem with individual furries
<LadyAvenger> Midnight_Tempest: *pets you* but you seem quite nice ^_^
<Ninjazz> Nothing is wrong with furries.
<RankWinner> Have I missed anything important?
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01but furries in general, well, youshould know what the problem is
<LadyAvenger> I know a furry IRL myself, and he's a nice fellow.
<Cypresswolf|Work> When is comic con this year?
<xles> LagnatheStreamedge: Yeah, damned freaks watching cartoons as adults.
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01as in, the fandom has a very bad name...for a reason
<Litwick> I've found strangely enough that the NSFW community in the brony community are NICER than the SFW community.
<WallDives> A person is smart. People are idiotic, panic'y bigots.
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01everyone does tend to represent groups by the most batshit of their integrants
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, i understand what you mean Lagna... but you cant say blame furries when it was obviously just a sick fan of the show...
<RankWinner> Blerg, it all depends on who you call a 'furry'. My friend calls hismelf a fury and just because he likes anthromorphic art, it's hardly something deplorable.
<Ninjazz> Still. Suprised we didn't see that earlier. A good quarter of the fan work is... you know.
<xles> RankWinner: You mean like 99% of furries then?
<Cypresswolf|Work> gotta go, boss is back :)
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01eh, in all honesty, I dislike pretty much all communities, I only like you guys. That's why you don't see me around much
<alexxm> bye Cypresswolf|Work
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01I'm just naturally a lone wolf
<ChimeraReiax> Bye skye
<Chrysalis> Saturn you there
<ChimeraReiax> XP
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Chrysalis: the new pack for ME3 is up
<LadyAvenger> <3 I like you too DCD ^____^
<Midnight_Tempest> everyone has the wrong idea of furries... like how people have the wrong idea of bronies... dont be fucking haters because there are a few bad apples... ffs...
<Thorn> Gamers for good is coming up.
<LadyAvenger> :D RX-78-SweetieBot!!!!
<Yahooz> we like you DCD ^_^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Hai LadyAvenger
<LadyAvenger> Yahooz!!!!
<xles> Midnight_Tempest: +1 on that one.
<WallDives> I tolerate you guys. I dont like most fandoms...
<RankWinner> Yep xles, just like how most bronies dislik- Ooooo Paradox stream is starting
<Chrysalis> RX-78-SweetieBot i'm still settin my computer back up at my parents
<alexxm> hey RX-78-SweetieBot hows your day been
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01not hatin', I got some furry friends, but let's face it, furries have bad rep
<Yahooz> Ohai LadyAvenger ^_^ i presume you saw the Avengers right? XD
<Thorn> At least, the mario marathon is going to be on in june.
<xles> RankWinner: ;)
<Thorn> Anyone gonna watch it?
<LadyAvenger> Yahooz: Yes. AND IT WAS AMAZING
<Yahooz> IKR
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Chrysalis> found out what saturn has sent me
<Chrysalis> as have my parents
<Chrysalis> cause they opened it
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: hi
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ?
<Sylandest1> LagnatheStreamedge: this fight is tricky as anything, it seems
<xles> LagnatheStreamedge: Very bad rep, and not for any good reason. They've spent the past 20 years trying to rectify certain incidents in the early 90s that nopony is proud about.
<RankWinner> If anybody cares about the indie/good game scene then here's a reminder: the Paradox press stream-thingy is starting, well, now.
<Sylandest1> Saturn: howdy
<Saturn> 08,01hey Sylandest1
<alexxm> whats the differance between the unlimited characters and they're normal selves
<LadyAvenger> :D Saturn!!!!!!!
<Saturn> 08,01LadyAvenger!
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<Chrysalis> Bronystate herder hat for BUCK
<Nick> man I'm tired
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01eh, all fandoms are batshit, that's why I'm not a fandom person
<Ninjazz> Hey Saturn.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> okay...
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: diditarrivediditarrivediditarrive??!!
<alexxm> hey Saturn hows your day been
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01Furries get a lot of flak because they're pretty much the largets fandom ever
<Kammerjunk> "All the ponies in this fandom are CRAZY!"
<Saturn> 08,01i just woke up a few hours ago
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01*largest
<Saturn> 08,01so not bad so far
<Litwick> LadyAvenger!
<Saturn> 08,01i used to be a furry
<Chrysalis> so yeah, my parents now know im a brony
<Kammerjunk> But then you t- no
<Saturn> 08,01then i took an arrow to the knee
<xles> If you want the true colours of the furry fandom, read this: unclekage.livejournal.com/140420.html
<Chrysalis> but havnt said anything...
<LadyAvenger> And how, LagnatheStreamedge. o3o my bf HATES bronies, but respects me and cares for me anyway.
<Litwick> FUCKING NINJAD
<Chrysalis> also, they opened my god damn post
<LadyAvenger> Ohai Litwick
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01and seriously, most of the time I stumble upon furries, I gotta facepalm...like those dudes that go FUCKING ANIMALS IS PERFECTLY NATURAL I AM A WOLF HEAR ME HOWL
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01again, association
<Saturn> 08,01but srsly, i was a furry when i was about 18 - 20
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol, otherkin
<xles> And thank you chrome for nomming my protocols, again. *grunt*
<Saturn> 08,01actually, must have been a bit longer than that
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: why did you suddenly stop being one?
<Yahooz-> frikkin school computer :/
<Chrysalis> Saturn yes it did
<LadyAvenger> I guess it was just a phase.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> fun
<LadyAvenger> Like my weeaboo phase @_@
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so bioware gave us a new sniper rifle... that shoots rockets
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkler: i disliked where the community was heading
<Yahooz-> ...
<WallDives> LadyAvenger, true story.
<Ninjazz> Oh... Weeaboo phases. :D
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkler: when i started in the community, it was very very different from what it is today
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah well its those people that ruin fandoms Lagna... but im done with this, im in a bad mood now...
<Chrysalis> RX-78-SweetieBot i think i just came a little
<Litwick> Never had a weeaboo phase. Because I have common sense.
<Saturn> 08,01it was actually a bit like today's brony community
<alexxm> how old are you Saturn
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it is rediculously overpowered
*Ninjazz pats Midnight_Tempest on the back
<Wrek> 05And the shroud of darkness once again was lifted.
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: 25
<Wrek> 05hi folks

*LadyAvenger huggles Wreky <3
<WallDives> hi Wrek.
<alexxm> hey Wrek hows your day been
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: hm, interesting, id think these things are more genetic than logical
<Invi> moin Wrek
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01all fandoms are ruined. Jesus, even Phoenix Wright.
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, i must have been abotu 16 or so when i started in the furry fandom
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so it will get nerfed eventually
<Wrek> 0520 out of 30 pages written
<Litwick> Hey Wrek. Mandows.
<Wrek> 05i cant bea ssed to do more today
<VioletGreySha> hay Wrek
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01that's why you shouldn't do fandoms, just like what you like
<WallDives> ^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> also a new shotgun that works like an electric flamethrower
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01befriend who you wish to befriend
<Ninjazz> LagnatheStreamedge: Whachu be saying about Pheonix Wright?
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01that's pretty much how I roll
<Chrysalis> :O
<Wrek> 05hi LadyAvenger! :D

<Ninjazz> You okay, Wrek?
<Wrek> 05nope
<LadyAvenger> What's GS5, WallDives
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01I don't really consider myself a brony per se...I used to, before the fandom went to crap as well. I guess it was a reality check, nothing really lasts.
<WallDives> Gyakuten Saiban 5 (aka Ace Atoorney 5)
<Ninjazz> I hope that shit sorts itself out somehow, Wrek. :S
<WallDives> Attorny^
<LadyAvenger> Ahhh.
<WallDives> Attorney^
<Magical_pablez94> howdy everypony!
<WallDives> Or, the "Alleged Gyuken Saiban 5"
<LagnatheStreamedge> 09,01I think this place is pretty much the last bastion on what I used to like
<Wrek> 05LagnatheStreamedge: i went the otehr way, still considered myself a brony but the others as douches

*alexxm hugs TheRainbowDash
<Darkts3> Giger4444: probably Dora xD
<TheRainbowDash> Giger4444: Hmm....I think Looney Tunes?
<geeky-brony> take a look its in a book reading rainbow
<Giger4444> And among cartoons which started in the 90s?
<CCCP> Giger4444: hopfully in the future fim wil be one of those

<SaxyPretender> 0,14What is this place filled with so many sentries?
<Mish> but it would take 14 seasons before that happened
*Chimera explodes in flurff
<Mish> :)
<Giger4444> CCCP: Yeah, Im just curious whats the average. I mean I think Samurai Jack was awesome, yet it only had 4 seasons.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: I believe so, just a little bit of it though.
<geeky-brony> :$
<MicTheSpectator> It's an amazing Wor-what is with the sentries?
<Chimera> all over Skylands
<Chimera> x3
<Mish> thats because samurai jack knew when to end
<Meanwhile> TheRainbowDash: It used to be, during it's earlier seasons, now it's so done to death that it makes me want to stick forks in my ears.
<Mish> so did avatar
<CCCP> Meanwhile: why in your ears?
<Darkts3> Avatar ended great
<MicTheSpectator> Ears are comfy.
<Giger4444> CCCP: Though Samurai Jack wasnt nearly as well known/popular as MLP:FiM

<TheRainbowDash> Meanwhile: I watched the new seasons, and it is still good quality, not as good of the older seasons, that is apparent, but at least it didn't fully die out, like the new Looney Tunes Show on Cartoon Network. Now that is a disaster beyond means.
<CCCP> OMFG!!! DAT LINK!!!!!!!!!!!! <#
<Darkts3> TheRainbowDash: i like it
<Meanwhile> TheRainbowDash: No show should last as long as The Simpsons has.
<Meanwhile> It's outright bad.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14All good things must come to an end, because they keep going on, it'll suck.

<Isaac> YaY
<RainbowAsh> GarrettBrony, maybe I didn't get some of the cunt-discussion context. To answer your question, in my opinion there are more important qualities to look for in a partner than gender.
<Isaac> i like sad things XD
<Biglaw> Holy buck this fanfic I'm reading is HILARIOUS!!!
<RaveBrony> Wait..what?
<Isaac> ???
<Petrified_Discord> RainbowAsh: For example, skin. I always date girls with skin.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Biglaw: Really?
<Michael> brb
<GarrettBrony> well put RainbowAsh Troll wont stand a chance dealing with you
<QT_Marks> i like my girls to have skin
<GarrettBrony> I like my girls to be ponie fans
<pony_7007> Where are all the wolves?
<Calcos323> Nest episode?
<Biglaw> my chat derped, who pined me?
<Biglaw> pinged*
<RainbowAsh> Petrified_Discord, skin is a big plus, It's a lot of work to clean up after them otherwise.
<Petrified_Discord> :D
<RaveBrony> Gender isnt an important quality?....I mustve missed the big part of the convo...
<RainbowAsh> GarrettBrony, why thank you. ^^
<Petrified_Discord> Melts wood? :O
<Meanwhile> It melts wood.
<QT_Marks> so that was the first episode i've seen, and i add'ed the buck out of paying any kind of attention to it :)

<Calcos323> Dark_Horst: Now you do lol
<Irish_Pony> hey everypony Im back from World Of Tanks and GOD was it crazy...
<FillyFlam> SirGanjalf: He's like if the Joker was annoying instead of cool, and looked like Ocelot from Metal Gear Solid 3 only not as cool as him either.

<Wrek> 05just a few notes:
<Wrek> 051: this show contains nudity and violence. if you dont appreciate such then turn off the stream. but dont complain about it.
<Wrek> 052: I am very dissapointed how this chat behaves when say boobs are on stream. you seem to think you can behave however you like jsut cause its on stream. dont. atleast act mature.
<RainbowAsh> Wrek, about 1: You forgot gratudious amounts of sex
<Kandarihu> I don't mind the violence. I do mind the nudity, but the main reason I'm not watching this is because of continuity.
<GarrettBrony> but the chat is really queit isn't it Wrek?
<ehm> Wrek: maybe overlay a "TVMA" watermark
<grovyleshy_wood> I just realized that I'm not coming back unless it's movie night. Some of the other things are like TV: they get a bit repetitive at times. Won't be back till friday for the movie night.
<TheRainbowDash> GarrettBrony: Well, it was on mute, +m at that time.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when you needed just a few notes?
<Petrified_Discord> Axe?
<FillyFlam> You know, you'd think it wouldn't phase us by now. >.>
<Ponies47> I thought the chat was paused :O
<Kandarihu> How much complaining has there been on this IRC about violence?
<grovyleshy_wood> and it does get a bit ridiculous
<TheRainbowDash> Ponies47: It was on mute.
<GarrettBrony> +m
<WallDives> you might have to restart the "experiment" where you kick/ban people for being immature.
<RainbowAsh> Bai grovyleshy_wood

*Kandarihu realized that he complained without meaning to.
*CCCP dances
<Ponies47> TheRainbowDash: I see
<TheRainbowDash> What a beat bro.
<FillyFlam> Dem beats
<Kandarihu> Sorry about that.
<DaringDude> bewbs :P
<Midnight_Tempest> let me guess... Game of Thrones is on the stream?
*GarrettBrony bangs on the drums
<grovyleshy_wood> I thank you for trying to get me to like these shows, but they're not my favorites.
<grovyleshy_wood> sorry
<TheRainbowDash> Ponies47: When it is on mute, only mods can talk.
<pony_4069> DD no references unless they are on sc reen
<Calcos323> The best armies/navys were the ones that played drums during battle

<Petrified_Discord> |Discord|: Good thing or bad thing?
<Saturn> 08,01or just politely saying "this is not that kind of massage"
<XAX> E-sports are awesome to watch.

*Nittany_Discord 11,01pews
<Articuno> lol I saw! D: like 22C right?
<Yahooz> improbability missiles eh?
<hen3ry> suddenly badass
<Kencolt> Even localised and mixed with two unrelated animes, Macross is still pretty much Macross.
*FlareChaser|Octavia is awesome
<Articuno> Thats actually not warm enough for me now XD
<Angel_Umbreon> 13The other day it reached 25C apparently xD
<Sumica> 00,10nice how they used an explosion to save on animationg the transformation
<Petrified_Discord> ROBOPAWNCH
<FlareChaser|Octavia> I haven't talked all day...
<SparkleButt> I actually want to know where they find people who dub bad anime.
<cachi01|PS3> TtTtTtTtTtTtTtTtTTtTtTtTtTTTtTt
<Yahooz> yes it is
<Ponies47> I'll be back in about 10-15 Minutes. Gonna go take a shower.
<BroniesFTW> Why did you stream on april 14th? Derpy?
<FlareChaser|Octavia> Seriously, I wasn't in Bronystate talking like usual.... weird..
<Ponies47> make that 0-5 minutes :P
<Petrified_Discord> "I have no idea what's happening here." You say that a lot, don't you? :|
<WallDives> FlareChaser|Octavia, but you were on a streak, you could have beaten fluttershy's record for silence...
<hen3ry> kidnapping a superior officer? Rewarded
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Normally people would want to go out and enjoy the nice weather and such, but I was all "nope too warm, staying indoors"
<Yukari> gtg bye
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dat explosion
<FlareChaser|Octavia> WallDives: damn.
<Kencolt> Yes. She IS having a psychotic break of sorts.
<cachi01|PS3> i spend 30 minutes on the shower and i only clean 4 places
<hen3ry> Oh, I know.
<WallDives> FlareChaser|Octavia, I'm sorry, that was harsh.
<FlareChaser|Octavia> WallDives: :'(
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Seeya Rawra :3
<GarrettBrony> Oh good Robotron
<Rain> "But I didnt wanna live.." :<
<hen3ry> dat anger management
<Reikim> So does the US Netflix still have Robotech? The Canadian version had the show picked off, and I'm still annoyed about it.
<SparkleButt> Wow, it's a young Dr. Claw.
<FillyFlam> Faiaiaiaiaght!
<GarrettBrony> I'll get you next time GADGET
<Kencolt> Who does he think he is-- Rainbow Dash?
<GarrettBrony> Minmay
<Articuno> :<
<Petrified_Discord> Thanks narrator man
<Tassadork> classy narrator
<Kencolt> Robotech is on Youtube, IIRC.
<GarrettBrony> I am older than Minmay by 1 year
<Rain> god, my internet hates me. it /always/ lags its ass off when good stuff is being streamed
<Sumica> 00,10it's also on hulu
<GarrettBrony> Hulu sucks
<Rain> why? its all the same shit, GarrettBrony
<Reikim> Someday, we should stream Macross Plus.
<GarrettBrony> Bronystate is better than Hulu
<FillyFlam> ^
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah
<Articuno> 25C, not bad, about the minimum amount for me XD
<Kandarihu> Compared to the original, this opening theme seems to shout "HOORAY FOR WAR"!
<Reikim> I think this should be obvious, GarrettBrony
<DitzyHooves> can we watch deadman wonderland next?
<GarrettBrony> it is
<FillyFlam> I remember way back when, when I would try to watch anime on Hulu and they would only have like 5 episodes from 5 different points in the series.
<Sumica> 00,10yes cause saying ma kuuuuu rossssssssss over and over says much of any thing
<Articuno> brbrbrbrbrbr
<FillyFlam> It was dumb.
<Quanyails> 7Haibye, Arti.
<GarrettBrony> The Theme song reminds me of the Spaceballs theme
<SparkleButt> This actually may be a Spaceballs spin-off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pods
<Petrified_Discord> Spaceballs: the Animated Series
<GarrettBrony> I love that series
<cachi01|PS3> there is an animated spaceballs series?

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hasbro makes all the things
<hen3ry> dat face
<Kencolt> What many fns don't take into account is that Macesk was NOT trying for an exact dub. At the time, you couldn't syndicate any series with less than 65 episodes-- that being the magic number for 5 eps a week and laswting 13 week, one quarter of a year.
<FillyFlam> Dat Scoot-Scootaloo
<Reikim2> Ah, Hasbro. Just as good, because Transformers.

<Kencolt> By combining Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada, he had 85 episodes total.
<Foxx_Ray> Eeyup.
<Sumica> 00,10But yeah the toys were well made too. I still have my rick hunter model veratech
<Reikim2> Nittany_Discord: All the way from headquarters!
<SparkleButt> Bitch be stealing his man.
<hen3ry> it must be broken
<Sumica> 00,10then again they were made of metal too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim2: Lol.
<Ponies47> Back
<Reikim2> Toy transforming planes? Made from metal and not practice? Blasphemy.
<hen3ry> red alert! We don't see anything! At least they're getting more genre savvy on the bridge

<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah I know shipping
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03using Celga it's gonna be doub le that
<Reikim> All physics geeks, please disregard the fact that they're using planes in space.
<drfsupercenter> 03Celga is a ripoff
<drfsupercenter> 03I bought a CD from Amazon Japan
<drfsupercenter> 03that cost like $9
<drfsupercenter> 03ended up paying $40 to get it to me
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Rain> indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's the only site I know that will buy Japanese stuff and ship them to wherever XD
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> get some action
<Rain> it irks me but I will get over it
<FillyFlam> Reikim: They use planes in space because Japan.
<DocSane> Good lord. Robotech?

<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<cachi01|PS3> my bro is so douchebag i think i will write a song about his douchebagess and then i will write a book and then a movie about the book
<Kandarihu> Maybe the wings are parsing through thruster exhaust.

<drfsupercenter> 03my sister and I had this discussion the other day about why it's called root beer
<drfsupercenter> 03she thought it actually had beer in it XD
<Rain> that is sooooo what she said
<Reikim> Eh? He is a Canadian!
<hen3ry> Dixon is best pilot
<Articuno> lol
<DocSane> Valkyries have thrusters all over. They're designed for space.
