7I'd say you were just scraping into lit, although you could actually be an adv.
10It's like attack of the birds! Only it's set in an underground city in England!
7AAAAAAAAAAARGH. The photoshopped prick got that one too!
7Even though that one does looked photoshopped...
7Lol.
7Yeah, definitely lit.
7I think... not entirely sure. XD
7Only just became an approver. >.< Not good at judging this shit. (Though all the ex-approvers that left during the exodus I have good contact with and so get their advice a lot. It makes it look like I know what the fuck I'm doing!)
4I never ask for help beleive it or not
4I taught myself
7Not in actual RPing, n00b. In approvery matters.
4....oh
4that
4I suck at that
7... Do you even know what 'that' is?
4the cake is a lie
7I'll take that as a 'no'.
4:D
http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/8006/Church+Wars/
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
7What YOU need to do, is sign up to the DCF, start RPing, get well-known, and then apply for approvership. Because if you do then there'll be four of us in April, and we can do away with that 'silly' (idiotic, irrelevant, incredibly lazy...) not-approved-in-a-week-gets-instant-approval.
7rule*
7XD
10Dari: xDDDDDDDDD
4'He held his flamethrower to my back'
4'Flames hurt'
7No, just join. You'll just be another new member. Start RPing a bit, and when you're atleast level 3 I'll get the other approver's opinion on you. Also, ROFL.
4maybe later. I gots stuff to do
7"Flames hurt." :D
Now Taco is sending messages to RDX on his profile!
Bahaha
4I did lol

3Hey everyone
6HOla
7Go away
/me 10destroys Hot Pockets
3Why?
7Because I dislike you, and being near me when I dislike you is to endanger your life needlessly.
3ehh.....
3Whatever
7Screw Razz.
13back
6Ouia
10(:
13I'm pretty sure I'm above her
13She doesn't even take care of that much
10Ahh, so that's how Razz became a mod...
13She only goes to show off her shitty art.
10I always wondered
7You're also part of SR's privy council (I'm still deciding on a name), right?
13Ummm I guess?
7Let me re-phrase that.
13Listen though, don't say things like "I am going to kill you"
7He trusts your judgement a lot?
13Yeah most of the time
7You said you were gunna kill the fucker >.<
13No I didn't...
7I swear to god if people don't stop randomly changing their opinions I'm going to go on a killing spree.
13I said in honor of that person I was going to censor str*ight when it comes to sexuality.
13Hey, CNL is a friend of mine
13I didn't know she did SxF
12yay for half hours? <=D
7Ok, so Razz is one of the lowest of the mods right?
12foolaboola.
12Hey Red.
6Hola
10Wb
4hello
12In my opinion yus.

7I'm going to strike, eventually.
4you? lol
10Razz = pompus brat
10*pompous
4in the attempt to do what lol....piss her off?
12:D :p
13bored...
7OOH, you know what would be fun! If there was a Spyroforum Civil War between the Razz Worshippors and those in actual control of their minds.
12=/
3What is so great about Razz anyway?
7"Why is- why is- why is- why is- why is- why is the rum gone?"
10:D
3NO RUM FOR YOU!
13She makes shitty art and calls herself a professional because she posts art on a kids site.
10Her art is overrated
12Hey. It doesn't just gotta be for kids! Spyro lovers of all ages :/:O
7The grown-ups are speaking.
/me 12shushes
10The reason she has so many views is because she draws the same exact Spyro/Cynder fluff over and over again
12:3
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQYHeNWCc8A
13meh
13I don't know
13Neal is above Razz and Raidon, and LoneKnight
13LoneKnight is above Razz
12OomBoomChoomDaChoomGloomMoomOolahooh
13I don't know about her and Raidon though
4I didn't see Raidon having much uses
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgLv8opWxiM It's IMMENSLEY satisfying to watch Hermione punch Malfoy over and over again at the start. I hate that prick.
6Dude 0_0 It was Rambo...
13They are both equally useless
4true
Raidon didn't annoy me
Razz does.
13They both piss me off
4Raidon was plenty annoying if he wanted to be lol
I doubt he would be able to annoy me.
7I also like how it's Snape asking why is the rum gone
7 1:10 onwards Harry's havign a twitch/spasm.

"My death?.... The Death of a Warrior. I want to die in battle. Mainly by sword. Right threw the heart. Like King arthur died. But IF I am to die in battle like a warrior should, then ill make sure i bring my slayer with me." Unrealistic much

So you got a 'replica' of something for free and you expect there to be a real version of it?
6yeah as it said it was a replica in small writing on it

Also, many people who are against globalisation are actually supporting it, by buying products from companies which are globalising (…Is this a verb?), such as people in the UK buying Nike products, and so contradicting themselves. w00t for contradiction in terms.

Another fact is that globalisation is inevitable, there is no avoiding it, it cannot be stopped, so why do people fight it? Instead they should try to embrace it, as it will happen.
12"Okay, you want to settle this man-to-man? Give me your address, you little ****!"

hi
Hey.
hey have you played any off the original Spyro games
All.
What are they like I've only played Season of Ice and some of Enter the dragon fly, that one had a glitch when loading this honey area
but I had rented it any ways
I also think I played a little of one of the first 3 at Walmart though
I've mainly played the legend of spyro games I kinda of like them a bit getter compaired to the ones I've played because I like story based games and
Games that you have to collect a bunch of a certain Item to continue sometimes loses my interest because it is hard. Plus I like the melee combat part

13Final Fantasy sux
the game I'm refering too is mainly about Sonic

7Fail.
7Fail fail fail.
7FAIL.

well my point is the game play of that game is going to be like im going to make mine... plus some what you would call minigames and by the way that game has a bunch of people who like it
I laughed at them

^first 3 games
7The Season of Spyro games were terrible. Actually, the only good games were the Insomniac games, and TLoS, although TLoS IS NOT Spyro, just like the Sonic X Sonic isn't the proper Sonic.
Meh.
So you didn't even get this 'secret artwork' off the game?

6Bull-SHIT
3What do you mean??!?!
6Was watching "A Haunting" and someone said that that was what they thought, and I instantly said "Bull-SHIT!"
6With ghosts and all that fun stuff...
3actually, ghosts do exist...
6I know, there's one in my house. Maybe more than one, I'm not exactly sure
3Damn.....
7So yuo claim it's bullshit, and then claim it's real?
3its too difficult to sense things over a computer....
6No, the "If I can't see it or feel it, it's not real" bit
6THAT is bullshit
6So not, I is not a hypocrite =P
6*So no
7Well then you my friend, are idiotic.
7When you die you die.
7The 'spirit' does not live on.
6So you're basically saying you don't believe in ghosts.

14...Hi
6Oui
7Not opinion
7Not 'sitings'
7Not religious opinion
7FACT.
3Well....I could actually prove it, but I would have to meet you in person....I HAVE the scars that prove that Demons exist....
7Right, because scars that you could've gotten from anywhere prove it.
3heh.....How about a large scar across your back that seemed to have come from no where...
7Could've-gotten-from-anywhere.
Edward scissor hands slashed you.
7If you're using these scars as proof, then first you must present proof that you got them from these so-called 'demons'.
7Shit, gtg now.
7Fuckin school.
6brb
3Its because Demons Cover up their evidence
3damn
3oh well
From personal experiences, I do believe Demons exist.
3They do....
3I've met a few of them, and actually had a conversation with one....
Thats a little extreme
3.....
3....I shouldn't have said that...
6Well, bbl anyways =P
/me 3sighs
I've had some really weird stuff happen, thats just enforces my belief in God, Satan, Hell and Heaven.
3heh....
3My beleifs are different then most......
4I did see a spirit or something at the foot of my bed once and when I blinked it was gone. Then again, I was also very tired and was probably seeing things
3Well, I tend to have quite a few "out of body" experiences when I'm completely relaxed....
3aka Astral Projection.....
I have a friend who's grandfather died

13The sound doesn't work. It's not on mute, though. It's not the speakers either, I tried plugging in headphones but it still doesn't work
13I tried restarting at least 5 times earlier this morning

13He's all like >8D
Hahaha that reminds me
I finished Breaking Dawn over the weekend
13I'm so screenshotting it
It sucked

Well she was right
It does
13hahahah
6I've only read the first lol
13she and I used to be Twilight fans until the fan base got huge and now neither of us really like it
I had nothing better to do so I just read all weekend
I read over 2000 pages, haha
6I can top that xD
In one weekend? :P
Yeah, probably
It's not that much

4Speaking of edward, I saw a picture of him and Harry Potter being hunted down by the main characters of Supernatural. (Basically saying that there is a HUGE war going on bewteen Tilight and Harry Potter...you'd have to see the picture)
13Your precious Edward is on drugs.
Don't scare him away right when he gets here :P
Twilight is nothing like Harry Potter
I don't see why people compare them

Ahahahaha, you should like my cousin Jarrod
12Secret power?
He always said that
eloeloeloel

13RAWR

so many zombies...so many
you know there's too many when you've got 3 people with machine guns and you STILL can't stop them
.
4hm
hi
4srry nothing really exciting going on here
I noticed
=P
4lol
4haha...frauderator
Oh yeah, haha
4you do that or SR lol
He did
It's part of his avatar
4ah
4I'm pretty inept with computers lol
Heh, should have seen me three years ago
4lol
4well I'm not inept but I know nothing near what most around here do
I'd probably laugh at myself if I went back and read some of my old posts and stuff
4lol
4well we can always go back and take a look :P
I mean back further than SF
4ah
The site I'm talking about is blocked on this computer
4yeah I remember
4my parents would have done the same thing to me at that age lol
I don't really mind
I can always use a proxy if I /need/ to log on there
4lol
Those things are annoying though
4I wouldn't know
Ads pop up every few pages or so
Guess that's why they're free -__-
4most likely lol
4Don't really care seeing as how I have much more important things to attend to that don't involve a compute rlol
So do I; I just don't feel like doing them
=P
Like my calculus homework, for example
4haha
I'm going to regret not doing that tomorrow, but oh well
4I never got that far
No school tomorrow
4vacation
4?
No, choir contest
We're missing most of the day
4you guys sing?
But I'll most likely be back for last period web design with dreamweaver... woo.
Yeah, I've been in choir since like 3rd grade
4hm brings back memories
4I was in it up until about 10th grad
4"grade"
4kept changing schools though so got sick of being in a different choir every time
Ah
4still sing as a hobby though
It's fun
4yeah I have to admit it is
4good way to relax
My choir director is awesome
Haha
4yeah all of mine were crazy lol
4including the band teacher
Must be a job requirement
4oh wait....same person lol
4and in the school I went to yes it was lol
4what's he doing now
I blocked him, but he's still replying to me somehow =/
4hm
4freaking hackers know how to get past all that junk
4well someone who knows computers well enough to get past such things lol
The blocking system probably only works on my journals and my art and stuff
4you never know
Unless doppel helped him or something... I dunno
4one of the wondeful things about the internet...most likely you will never know the full truth about anything
Yeah...
I guess I should just not reply and he'll leave me alone
It's tempting, though
4maybe
"Damn, you are such a whore you know that? lolololololololol. To tell you the truth, I no longer give a fuck about Spyroforum or any of you punks."
4.........
4what a freaking prick -.-
Right after he said "Please let me back on Spyrochat. I'm sincerely sorry!"
Or something like that
4those are guys I'm glad to deck in real life at any time
Riiiight, that's believable
Haha, yeah
4well
4Needless to say around me that wouldn't happen
Hello
4I really do hate people like that though
Peace
Yeah, me too
I wouldn't let him back here if he paid me
4niether would SR so I think we're set
All he ever did was whine and complain about his life on here anyway
4heck I wasn't even here for what he did and even I wouldn't want to let him on
HAPPY MARDI GRAS!!!!!!!!!!!:D
He'd just sign in and insert complaints about Brawl every 20 minutes or so

That was annoying
4When I meet people like that I get very very.........annoyed
I came back right after Doppel got demoted
So he emailed me his story and stuff
And wouldn't stop whining at me about how he lost it =P
4his own fault
4don't be a complete moron

4go ahead and complain about it

Yeah, I think anyone should have the common sense not to use TOR to spam SF when he's so close to being banned already
=P
4yeah
4and on top of that someone who is in a seat of power
Ugh, what now? D:
2What do you mean "a seat of power"????
4A moderator
2ok.
4=seat of power
2thanks
I had a huge argument with him over PM about whether my brother was memberating or not once
Kind of just kept going in circles
4I had a political argument with him
Oh, I'm sure
He's a big fan of Obama, isn't he?
4yeah the typical brainwashed liberal
4he "was"
"Was"?
1,8New Topic Alert:2 "Do you think I should get a new signature?" by Mysterious Cynder, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8818
4apparently after I got through with him his view on Democrats was vastly altered
4wow should that even be a topic?
2I hate Obama>
2(.)
Maybe it's in spam.... Meh
Yeah, I was just watching Obama speak about half an hour ago
4Gneral Chat
4Psst..don't even get me started on Obama.....
Me and my dad kept making random comments about what he was saying
4It's enough I have to be paying ooff his stupid stimulas package for the rest of my life
anyone here?
2Do you know what c.h.a.n.g.e. means?
11no
2not you
4don't say it
4I remember someone saying it and it's not appropriate
2you know then right
6you said it to everyone i thought geez
I laughed when he said that it's "not acceptable" to drop out of high school and that everyone should turn off the video games and read to their children.
4as much as I don't like Obama I have to support him because he is my president
6cool! i wanna know!
Yeah, well if Obama says it, we'd better damn well do it =/
6lol
6LOL
2Oh no you don't
6u really care!
6i don't
4Psst..Obama is just elegent words behind the perfect mask
6ok?
Exactly =P
4doesn't matter anyways
4watch Glenn Beck
I noticed his little cheerleaders behind him too
4that guy is pretty good
6wow this is the first time i have actually logged on to spyro chat and there are people here
Stupid smiles on their faces the whole time
2Realy??
4oh of course
6yep
4we are jsut one big happy liberal family
6ok?
4thanks to them the country is heading for the worst social disastor ever
But at least we'll get tax breaks! Free money, yay!
6i watched the live show when obama flew in at school that's all we did all day it was fun
4yeah.....right
2Mysterios_Cynder, you from the south???
6yeah....right what?
That was sarcasm by the way =P
4Tax breaks I'm sure
6i did!
4yes I know
4lol
6I REALLY DID!
Kind of hard to tell on the internet sometimes
6well duh
4We're actually going to be the ones paying back the trillion dollars he just spent on nothing
I wish I was from the south
I love it there
6but if you knew my teachers email i could actually have proof!
And I'd have the week off for Mardi Gras
4and not to mention he gave another hefty 20 million to the unions for all the loving support they gave him
2I'm in florida rigt now
4It's bad enough people have no work ethic in this country....
6i am from south
4and no character
6by the way you can call me mystery for short (that's what everyone calls me...)
6or MC
6doesn't matter
2I was born in southeast Alabama
4I'm from the North
6i was born in washington, kirkland
I was born in Florida
But I don't live there anymore
6i have a question, what is the thing on the side of this chat with all the names for??
2When I was born we imeadiatly moved to Florida
4so you know who is on?
4and so you can PM them if you want
That's everyone on chat right now
6weird
If the name is red, it means that person is typing
6oh yeah now i remember something
6cool
2gotta go brb tommorow!!!!!!
6kayz
4anyways...no use getting worked up about it....we'll let the Liberals run the country for four years and see how it turns out
2bye
6by by
6she quitered
6lol
6are we the only ones on?
Yeah, I'll bet it will be longer than four years though
4most likely
6ok
Unless Obama does such a terrible job everyone gets sick of him
4depends on how brainwashed they can make them before the next election
Yeah
4the lack of willpower people have really does amaze me
6who did everyone want to win?
4McCain
My dad decided he would try and keep track of how many times Obama blamed Bush for the economy
6i wanted mc cain
4tell him to do the same for all Democrats
I was surprised he only found two =P
6i am a republican
4They will do nothing but blame Bush for whatever troubles come to them in the next four years
Yeah, it's stupid
6i am happy that there is a first black president but i just liked mc cain more
4the whole black president thing doesn't matter
6for me it does
6it's important
4it should have had no significance to an election
4no it isn't
4what matters is what's underneath
4not outside
I think it's kind of cool that that can happen, but not if people are just going to vote for him because of his race
4and race is the perfect leverage for any of them to have
13Hay
6because now that the whole racisim thing is over and there's a black president i think it does matter
13back
Otherwise it's just as racist as if people decided not to vote for him because he's black
4soon enough whites are going to be the minority in this country
4Racism isn't over there MC
4they accuse us of Racism if we tell them the truth
4it's the perfect leverage for them
6i'm actually glad that obama won
Why's that?
4hahahhahaaha
4Personal rights have become the ultimate offensive weapons now
6because i'm totally glad that there is a black president!
6yeah ture dat
6yeah true dat
Hmm...
4you can't tell anyone the truth without getting accused of either Racism or stereotyping
13Ugh.
13Bored..
6what?
6oh
4and just because he is a black president it's good that he won?
4you're kidding me right?
4I would have sooner voted for Morgan Freeman
6yeah why do you think i'm on spyro chat! i'm waiting for all my comments to be answered or replyed
13So WAZZUp
13I'm on SpyroChat 24/7
6now tha's racist
13People need to come here more often.
6LOl
4oh please tell me how that is racism
4enlighten me
13That isn't racist...
6well how come when i go on you aren't on!
I see nothing racist about that comment
=/
13And if you meant the Morgan Freeman part, Morgan Freeman IS black :P
4Morgan Freeman is black?
4again tell me how that is Racism
6this one: and just because he is a black president it's good that he won?
6LOL
You're not racist for pointing out someone's race
4again that's not racism
4seriously
4learn your facts
That's the truth
6morgan freeman is black LOL
6shut up
It's not a good thing that a black president won if he's going to screw up everything
4Why you're the one sounding foolish right now lol
13Races are a part of life. Deal with it. If I talk about Mexican food, am I being racist to Mexicans?
13Hell no.
4don't worry we will all be paying it off for a very very long time
*gasp* You said Mexican!
Racist!
6cool glad you idmitted it
4STEREOTYPING
Admitted what? O__o
4and I seriosly think that she has no idea what she is talking about
Eh, probably not
Ah well
4lol
6dang that smiley face sure has a lot of mouths
6yeah mon
6no one ever uses smileys
4It's ok....I'm sure all those broken promises will come due
6:):(:D:s:/:P:O;) LOL
6what broken promises?
There's no way anyone /can/ change some of the things he's promising
13Don't spam if it's unnecessary
6dat makes no sence
4just like your statements
Like, honestly, what's he going to do about kids dropping out of high school?
4and all the promises he made to both the left and the right that he has no intention of fulfilling
4seeing as how they made him say just about anything to get into office
4wow
4I'm mean because I tell the truth
4amazing
6sure ya do
No, you're a meanie bo beanie =/
6lol

13UNCLE DAWI
13D=<
13meh
13I haven't seen you make any videos in a while, DPX
2good point i was just watching a video of y i dont make them any more.... here take a look
2what a coincadence.....
2I even left a comment on that video to to agree with them
13There is a way to bypass the filter now that I discovered myself.
2its not just a filter but people going around and flagging the videos as inapropriate and stateing thy are copyrighted
13People don't do that
13It's an automatic filter put in by the UMG
2happened to my spyro on crack 1
2they deleted it because a spyro hater hated it and marked it as in apropriate
2and youtube sent me an e-mail saying that it insulted some one so they removed it
2pizzed me off
2it didnt state who it just said some other guy on youtube.....
13And that's why you shouldn't get yourself involved in YT fights or on other videos.
2i didnt... but this is starting up and im tired of it.... even a video that had nothing copyrighted in it on a dragonfishfood video me and my friend made they deleted because of copy righted material
2it was all done by our voices.... so does that mean our voices are copyrighted?
13Was there a song at the very beginning of this video?
2and like he said his best 2 videos were deleted.... thats what happened toi me
2within temptation one and... spyro on crack 1
13Eww WT
2nope..... we just started the video
2Withing temptations own Even.... and night wish... and fall leaf

13FUUUUCK
4I think he was talking about his game there >.>
13No, he labels me with "Phases"
13to piss me off
13For Fuck's sake he needs to stop.
13So I skipped his phases and went straight to the point this time.
13ugh.
13gtg bbl
6i remember now when he first said that something about phases 1-5 or something bit harsh really, i can see why your annoyed
10eee
13He does it on purpose out of nowhere all the time to set me off.
13I should just perma ban him but I'm not like that
10Finley needs to learn to sit on his beanbag rather than drag it around yelling YOURE A MOOSE
10its getting annoying now.
6why not ban him for a month or something? but tell him the period of time he is banned for though.
10Pahaha I've only just realised.
10Unless someone sends him a virus of some kind...
10wait, that's mean. *slaps self*
4He isn't even how close I can get if I am pissed

2What's your favorite of the spyro games new and old?
6ive seen that on the internet, who actually has one?
...Wow.
3What, spyro pinball?
3I don't think that exists
hmm...
Yeah...
2I like Dawn of the Dragons because you can fly at any time you want to and there's the 2 player co-op with Cynder.
I liek Spyro pinball, because pinball > you
/me 3hates Cynder :P
4DotD sucked for me
^ Same
Especially the ending...
3Never played DotD
3Tbh, never got into tLoS
No one EVER kills all the good characters off.
4Don't get me wrong, I liked it on my first playthrough, but once I saw the ending I was like 'well shit.'
yeah
2My fav elements are Shadow and Ice.
2Also wind
6fire for me all the time
4Fire = win
/me 4is a pyromaniac
3Elemental breath types = Fail
6as thats what spyro started with when it first came out
2I wonder why the producers stopped using the elemental fury's?
Pie breath > All
Pie Breath = 1-hit-KO on Dark Master
4Becuase out of fear of visual effects
3lyke 0/\/\6 5rsly?
Yes, really.
6not again
3O_O!111
Yes, again!
Ahahahaahahahah
3:\
...I can't even remember everything it does.
4O_o
6o.O
2My favorite fury is Spyro's because he's a rare purple dragon.
What? Lol.
4That made no sense
2Um,Yeah it did.
4That's like saying 'I LIKE CUPCAKES BECUASE THEY COME IN VANILLA!'
6The fury is the same as Cynder's, but yeah its still good
6what?
4I think Dari's brain died
4I rest my case

Who's code did you use for that?
Are you talking to me???
or someone else
Which you can download.
You need a server, and a client.
Then added commands and crap to allow you to do stuff.
Where did you get the chat client?
Made it.
It's just a text box with some code on it.
That works with the server.
When you press send or press enter, it sends what's in the text box, if anything.
The easing effect came with the server though. Didn't make that. Lol.
gtg bblz
The fuckin thing had a spasm on me
I'm not going in the bathroom again, I JUST got orange, and it fucks it up

Hey.
Hi
Hey Spyro

Hey
Hi
Does anyone know why when i get rid of the space and put the S and M in caps that it calls me spyro instead of spyro master?
No spaces are allowed in names on here.
C7! *tackleglomps*
*takleglomps_back*

lol
i got there in the end XD
Hello everyone
Lol,yup
Hey
I see a Cynder...
YAY!
XD
/me cries
O_O
"Well... when you get fired, what happens to the shocky-monkeys?" "Well, some are shipped off to labratorys for experament, others end up in mah belleh!"
NO MORE CYNDER.....D: I hate her.....*cries*
Lol
Well balls. I gtg in 20 mins.
oh get over it....
D=
(Go to if you can watch stuff that swears): http://www.illwillpress.com/tech5522.html
I like Cynder....
Lol,thnx
Wb
im back, connection went
Oh
Oui
If only the connection would go forever...
oh no....we have a Spyro and a Cynder in here....
lol
Get the condoms
o_O
EXACTLY!
Lol
No secking here!
*secksing
O_O
I really don't want to deal with little dragons and having fantards squeal
O_O
XD very funny
O.o but weird though
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE!
O_O
Becuase I can easily press the ignore button if that is where it is going
Lol
I don't write fanfiction
I only make videos.
Not every story on FF.net is SxC
Just 59/60
lol
Dari: 199/200
I can't beleive I used to like Cynder
Oh wait, she wasn't that obsessed over then
/ascii
...
There are only 500 or so on there, which would mean there are only 2½ stories which aren't SxC
Lol.
When there were about 100 on there before Cynder existed.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4hFb2A2ICc <-- PWNSOME SONG
I win. :P
Well....I'm writing a FxE story
"Spyro and Flame: In Love Until the End"
I'd rather Spyro with a fan character than Cynder ATM...
/me likes bringing about the 'end' extra early.
meh
Come on...it doesn't have to be the best hting ever. Just a slap to the face for SxC people
Or you could have Spyro torture Cynder, then kill her.
Lawl.
The 'Spyro and Cynder are siblings!' one.
O_O
Flame slapped Cynder away from Spyro angrily. I can't let her win him, he thought desperately.
Oh god yeah
xP
"Cynder then found out that she and Spyro were siblings...And promptly threw herself off a cliff"
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee *Splat*
XDDDDDDDDDDD
lol
Spyro took Flame into his front legs and never wanted to let go. "I love you..." he whispered.
:P
/me is writting a little list thingy called 'the 100 deaths of Cynder'
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
I like it already.
Link me when you're done
lol
It's on the back of my mind atm. I has other things to do first
You should have made is 101, 101 > 100
It's like those books "101 ways/uses to/for..." "101 ways to kill Cynder"
Ah
That could work
No.1 drug her and tell her she can breath underwater...
LOL
XD
101 uses for a wee...... (Brainiac series)
i saw that
"Spyro headed over to the bookshop, and after just a few minutes of searching, found the book he wanted '101 ways to kill Cynder'"
Lawl
one of them was that it could stop a jellyfish sting from killing you or something
HA
lol
Hopefully ending in her death.
no2: Rickroll her 2829742372 times
OR, get into one of those action sequences where it's "Press X to save Cynder!" and then refuse to do it.
LOL
No3: Spyro says "Hey good lookin, what's cookin?" and roast her for Thanksgiving dinner.
lol
No.101 tell her to kill spyro or kill herself
ehe....*opens up a word document and begins to copy this*
Number 101 has to be special.
hmm good point
Special as in Sp.Ed.? lol
101. Cynder gives birth to 101 spotted dragons and dies giving birth to the 18th one
no101: Give Spyro 1 dollar to rape, kill, and revive Cynder, only to do so in an infinite cycle
O_O
......................
.____.
meh
O.o
Shows my hatred too much?
I don't like that one. e__e
Lol
101. Rip Cynder's head off, using magic liberally to keep her alive, and then use magic liberally again to take control of her higher brain functions and make her destroy her own body in swathes of her own poison/shadow-flame thingy.
O_O
LOL
I likez it.
Let fantards fight over her.
They'll rip her into pieces.
Razz sux
this one should be better
/me loves picking out the many things wrong with DotD
XD
Lol
"My wings are too small to support my huge head"
Heh.... I never paid that much attention xD
LOL
LOLPARROT!
im ok with cynder as a character but to be honest all these spyroxcynder things are annoying as there are so many
Some Chinese fishermen catch Cynder, cut off her wings to use in soup, then drop her off a cliff.
Same. Cynder the character is fine...fans can go fucking die
OMG
OMG
HAHAHAAHAHHAA
well thats original
XD
Let fantards fight over her.
They'll rip her into pieces.
:P
Oh lol

Hmmm
First, press ok with less than 5 characters in the password box.
"Hmmm" doesn't work
:P
I didn't say that was the password.
Lawl.
Doesn't work =P
A message should come up if there are less than 5 characters in the password box.
It does for me.
I'm laughing so hard right now.
Doesn't work.
>_>
...
Yes it does, delete everything written in the password box.
Egan is all scared because there was a bomb threat in our town.
Press ok.
XD
Then some text will appear in the password box.
Doesn't work.
Does work.
Nope.
Stupid IE?
Yep
The police came to me house last night.
Another reason I wanna have a go at this competion is because of the fact that EA is joined with it :D
I'm being arrested for posession of over 60 types of hallucinogens.
Plus one instance of possession of an illegal FRench pastry.
It's quite obvious really.
only for you because you made it that way! D=<
Did everyone put me on ignore or somethign?
LOl.
Weather lol?
Just search for text boxes you can type in.
`w
There are only 3 text boxes or so to test.
Dari, I need some help. Preloaders again.
...
Again?
Look at the other file you put a preloader in
Copy-Paste :P
Um.... I was serious.
Besides the drug part.

...a dog repeller?
Ultrasonic emitter
But I need something much much more powerful
I heard that there was something like that used on rats...
I dunno how sensitive a rat's hearing is, but I don't think it's as powerful as a dog's.
LOLOLOL
Did you know that ultrasonic emitters were discovered by accident?
I didn't know, and I don't really care right now, I just need something super powerful
I had a feeling you didn't.
Like blow a dog's eardrums out powerful
LOL
Yeah
Ok?
and thats like the most powerful one I can find
Then mabye you should use it if it is the only best option you found.
:P
*:)
Oh wait
G2G guys!

D:
i will see you tommorow
The point of me coming on here is to ask if anyone knows of anything more powerful.
Well, I've never had any dog problems, so... sorry.
Neither do I, theres an annoying dog next door at my grandpas
and he would like soemthing he can point at it to shut it up.

i fucking hate how i always put out drawing posts and they always never post on them i mean is there a problem that i love to draw but i'm just not as good as chichiro and razz???
on this forum pretty much
Razz is the artist god here
what do you mean?
you're complaining to someone who can't draw a circle, no sympathy here XD
she's pretty much the only one who will get attention
i can't draw perfect circles either. sometimes i can but only in i focus
*if
She is the oldest active member on this forum
and there he goes
what I tell you
well i'm the most active member they probably will ever have
no you're not lol
lol
...for how long?
you have not even been on that long
LOLOLOL

*months

and you have how many posts?
wait hold on
only 92 but i have only been on for like 7 months and razz is a mod
you have 92
so what's your point about Razz/
?
...I wish they'd release a new game, I sort of miss all the "Help me!" topics
but what i mean is when i post i post on everything
I have been on this stie since November and I have almost 3,000 posts
same here
theres a whole bunch on chao.hippotank.com
92 posts over 7 months is not considered active lol
I would have alot more posts and gem if I stayed away from spam.
*gems
Lol.
It's hard to stay away from spam.
maybe for you
no but i forgot about this for like 4 months so yeah
It's like an addiction right?
and thats the truth
But the spam section is the most fun.
yes
that leaves 92 posts over 3 months lol
that's still not active
That's active for me.
Lawl.
for me too
you're not even considered active until your're over 100 lol
Depends.
This is geting boring, so im just going to leave, bye everyone!

IT SPOKE!
If even have one post, I consider you active.
Because about 2700 of 3600 members on SF have 0 posts.
also when i was on here for 3 months, i barley ever posted but now i p[ost all the time
...

And I've made more messages on here than most have.

/me has apparently failed in his attempt to start conversation
I beat kingdomhearts re:chayn of memories in 9 hours straight and all that happened to me was that I had a seizur.
9 hours straight?

Is this a spyro char forum or just a random chat room?
random chat, and whos asking?
the father of a daughter
ooh
you must be related to the kid who wandered in earlier
This chatroom was created for the discussion of spyro, but members also like to discuss other things as well.
yeah, she has been wanting to talk to others interested in spyro
visit the forum: http://www.spyroforum.com
Post on there. Usually, the topic of this chatroom is that other than spyro.
yeah...
very aware of the forum
Any other questions?
if you're looking for an actual chatroom on spyro, this isn't the place
is this site even authorized?
SpyroChat.com is authorized by SpyroForum.com (It's parent site)
how so?
the copyright owners...
negative
is there an OFFICIAL site?
thank you
They have a chatroom on there, but as you will find out you cannot type the things you want to say and can only send pre-written messages.
You are not able to hold a discussion.
hello...who ever you are
Hello
thank you for your time
As he introduced me to this place.
hmm, not in the habit of prying about it
you missed a rather interesting conversation
hmm
bbl
hello
anybody here?
lol
why are you guys on here when you are not going to say anything?
lol
?
Oh
I just wanted a second opinion for the forum
I am a it sick of all the arguments
so I am going to ban discussion about the following topics: Sexuality, Religion, and Politics.
Good idea
I didn't want to do that but kids can't handle those topics.
Indeed
Hai
Sounds good.
I really hate it when people bring up topics arguing about be gay
and I just figured id ban it all in one shot.
Same..
.
sound good>
spyrochat is still open for anything though
yup
Now im trying to think about how to word this....
Ill make an announcement saying these topics are off limits for discussion at spyroforum
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-2756.html lololol
"Intrests: Edward posters"
XDD
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-263085.html#263085
Yalp, just read it
and stop members from trying to argue about how being gay is alright.
yeah
brb/bbl
I think i have came to a conclusion

</story>
Dwaggies>Chuck Norris
ohhh
just thought of something interesting
General: yes, fighting: Dwaggies no longer exist, it's _____<Chuck NOrris
Cynder vs. Chuck Norris vs. Jack's Jar of Dirt
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-263508.html#263508
To molest Malefor who was on the other side.
LOL
Chuck Norris<Jack's jar of Dirt<Cynder lol
=/
Actually, switch Cynder and the jar of dirt
No, don't.
Wait.
You've got them the wrong way round.
lol
The Jar of dirt wins the fight
Hands down
It should be Chuck Norris>Jack's jar of dirt>Cynder
Nope
Cynder wins
Cynder would try to headbutt the jar, and end up knocking herself out xD
No, The Jar of Dirt does
Nope
The Jar of Dirt always wins
And Cynder would just...... win.... I don't know xd
Vs. Chuck Norris, anyways
okay, here's a better one....
Chuck Norris vs A Jar of Dirt vs Spyro vs Cynder
xD
Spyro and Cynder would end up making out
Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris
and the Jar of dirt would win
heheh.... Bwoos Wee doesn't exist
____<Chuck Norris
THE JAR OF DIRT PWNS ALL!
......I don't know....
/me refuses to comment xD
Remain Neutral
Say Nothing!
Answer
SR would win
No neutral
Because everyone knows that SR is awesome
:P
SR
The jar of dirt would pwn SR
Merlin vs. Chuck Norris
Nope
lol
You know the jar of dirt would pwn you SR
Admit it
you're just going to get kicked again
And?
First time is a kick, second a ban.
Mkay
okay....
here's one
But you know its true
I would get pwned
yep
I couldn't beat the jar of dirt
I wonder if SR will actually ban me
lol
I wouldn't really care
Rum vs Chuck Norris
RUM
Chuck would drink the rum.
</story>
Then the rum would destroy him
from the inside
here's why the rum is gone
because it went to kick Chuck Norris's ass
brb/bbl
lol
LOL
Nah, I'd find a way around his ban
He wouldn't perma-ban me
He's a softy
Yeah, but he wouldn't ban me in the first place.
I'm sure

Maybe, SR banned people saying it and she's on thin ice. Just DO IT.
dari: leave me alone already yes i do
lol
-_-
I wouldn't get near them again
Don't accuse her of being a n00b, then she'll say she's not and it won't work. Use actual manipulation, not accusation.
hm
*as
That would be awesome
Oh.
Lol.
I I hate dolphins because I've been attacked by them on 3 separate occasions.
He was attacked by them not once, not twice, but thrice

Hic est testimonium
o.o
You don't speak Latin.
This chat is of Spyro. someone plays to Spyro's games? Or not?
It is a dead language.
You translate/write it.
Its not a dead language
It is
...
vaya, que timo de que nadie hable espaÃ±ol...
My screenname is Latin
So?
Ã§.Ã§ estoy solito
It is a dead language.
Its not
No nationality speaks it.
What does it mean?
Therefore, it is a dead langauge.
Its mainly used in ancient Mythology research
It is still a dead language.
...
A dead language means that it is not spoken anymore.
The English are taking over..
Now I'm starting to feel miserable again..-_-
"Here is Proof" thats what I said
Aa
Ã¹.u haber...
Spyro eternal night? runey runey? xD
and My screen name is the Latin word for "Light"
:O
or... spyro Dawn of the dragon? PS3 ?Â¿ xD
W...
T...
F...
hes talking baout spyro
UGH
but he cant speak good english im guessing
...
I am of espaÃ±a. My English is very bad(wrong)
kk
I didn't understand him that well....I guess
let me find google translate
Esta bien!
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU CONFUSE US!
As does everyone else
I just keep getting that feeling..
Lol

Ya,I know..

Got it Memorized?
Yus
Oh god... Batman and Robin's on... TURN IT OVER. TURN IT OVER. *melts*
LOL
O_O
Is that your weakness then? :P
well im fine with top gear for now
No, it's just something I hate
My weakness doesn't exist, remember?
You have no weakness...?
lol
My English is of Ingleterra, is the one that they teach(show) in the institute
cool fair enough
Why the hell am I so fucking bored!?
LOLOLOLO;LOL
I AGREE
Dari: No, my weakness is there, it just doesn't exist. It probably does in some parrallel universe, but not this one. Nor will it ever.
I wish I could speak Elvish
Elvish?
its a Laguage on Lord of the Rings
fresco bastante justo
o.o
Oh my GOD
Now that would be sad.
WHAT A LOSER
That's like saying you want to leanr klingon or something ><

Translator is BS
Ah, ok, I also use the translator of google
lol
Babelfish > google translator
Yay
Another friend of mine..
vale
ok
hm
Latin is a fun language to speak
difficult...but fun
You don't speak Latin...
You do not speak dead languages.
and I do have a friend that can speak it too...
You write the.
God,the summer really ought to come..
Or read them.
winter owns all
You have to Speak them to write them or read them
Only if where you are, you get snow.
ok/vale
No you don't.
You do not speak dead languages.
Psst...I just need more snow so I can keep boarding
You can If you want
And I hope I'll have passed the class..
Do you take oral tests for Latin?
No, you don't.
If you want, I give you my msn and we speak for. Here he(she) writes very rapidly, has not time me of translating everything.
No, Its just, you can only properly understand a language
if you speak it
Nope.
Yay..my cousin's bf logged in
Speaking Latin is different to writing it.
im ok thanks, but thank you for the offer
but im guessing that last bit is you can't translate everything fast enough
Ancient Greek is supposed to be easier than Latin, although I find Latin easier.
Latin is hard
9 more minutes and I leave and become even more bored
Nah.
It's quite easy.
depends on the person Dari lol
You just have to remember all vocab.
all the*
Ancient Greek is hard with the teacher we've got..-_-
Personally I have never tried it....but my sister did

I'll get banned more if I do..
Or tell them that they are too pathetic to quit smoking.
Then make them a bet.
lol
I've been telling them to cut it out since I was THREE
Or replace all their cigarettes with nicotine inhilators.
Wish I could..
Or go to the roof of your house and threaten to jump off if they don't stop.
-.-
o_O
That would scare them, even if you aren't planning to jump off.
don't go suicidal
I think it's time to ignore dari now
...
yup
It would work.
They would crap themselves.
Then stop smoking.
you're trying to kill her not stop them
O_O
XD
...Nope, she obviously isn't meant to jump off.
Just threaten to.
Make sure it's not a windy day though
They would be so scared, they would quit.
hm
you can't quit with suicide
Lol
She wouldn't suicide, idiot.
only with murder XP
Abbey = -IQ

Dari: No, she's a chav. She lives in London.

Oh.

Neither do I, you're still a chav however, to be hated and eliminated from the gene pool
I'm not gonna waste my time with someone who is scared to show their writing lol
Dude, is that the best you can come up with?
I mean come on....
I'm not scared RDX.
Hiding your profile is quite pathetic, Abbey.

"she killed innocent lives" You can't really kill lives, you can destroy them, kill people, etc.
lol
and you did say that you could make what...60 chapters?
Heh heh

I think it's time that I updated so everyone knows I'm still around lol
LOL
Heheheh.

Let's all go publish our freaking 10 chapter 5,000 word stories that say ..."OMG SPYRO IS SOO IN LOVE WITH CYNDER THEN THEY SO GET IN A FIGHT WITH EMBER AND GAUL....CAUSE LIKE....EMBER IS JEALOUS AND ALL THAT.....THEN MALEFOR COMES IN AND TRIES TO GO WACA WACA CRAZY ON EVERYONE AND THEN SPYRO FRIES HIS BUTT AND MARRIES CYNDER THE END."
Lol.
Although it would be 10 chapter, 2000 word.
yeah prolly lol
eh...I agree
5,000 was a little much lol
straight from the heart lol
someone should post that as a good example of n00b writing
I'm ok at writing, just too lazy, lawl.
lol
I'm trying to write, but I've got writers block....
eh...I have had it for awhile now
Reason no.27 why I left FF.net. people suck at writing now
Not sayin I am the best but...holy shit
Mmhmm...
eh
I ignore them
and just focus on the good ones
I actually CAN'T read stuff with multiple spelling/grammar errors.
what few their are
I seriously can't.
It's just too distracting and annoying.
I have spelling issues. Yet I can do better than most of the people on the site. Which is saying something, as they all make OC's that suddenly take the spotlight
your stories were good man
I hated em
O_o
Why?
well they were good to outside readers
I jsut didn't like where I was going with them
Gah. I'm trying to work out what Egg Thieves look like under thier cloaks
*their
lol
they look like Dari of course :P
Dang... that's better than them being ostriches!
Shhh... everyone.. be quiet...
OH, crap
......
you hate me don't you
Of course I do, because I WASN'T joking and this ISN'T sarcasm
/me passes out and falls through several floors
I'm okay.....blergh
Ignitus isn't half as cool as Volteer
And he SURE isn't half as cool as Cyril.

Being evil is SO much fun.

Plus I say Anthro
Oh whatever :P
/me resists the urge to throw in a comment
We're all furry in some places
Now that I could not aviod
/me resists the urge to throw in another comment
That's stupid, if someone reads it on someone's profile where the number is 23, not 49, they will post their's as 24, not 50.
BRB
Hm. I could read it

So true.

Y'know, wouldn't Bentley's club eventually... melt?
oops
Bit LONG don't yah think?
Quiet
Meh
I will not make my own Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
I will not make them in a box and I will not make them with a fox.
Quiet sam-I-am

I am not Sam-I-Am. And I do not like Green Eggs and Ham.
I do not like Green eggs and spam
How about Egga, Spam, Bacon an Spam?
*Eggs
What, you didn't give him a "Legendary Dragon" rarity?(Yes, that IS a real rarity)
...
Not in the card game it isn't
Only online
......
:)
Yu-Gi-Oh nerds....
NOT nerd
Geek
There IS a difference
Geeks>Nerds
Exactly.
Geeks>nerds>dorks
How dare you
Dorks is the lowest form of life
http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4760/121199o.jpg
Dorks>Geeks>Nerds
Dorks suck
Geeks pwn
here's something better
In that case, I suck
Of course, being a Doppel is lower than all of them
And nerds have friggen' taped glasses o_e
Jocks are the lowest form of life
well...the ones that don't have an IQ
All jocks eventually work for geeks
It's the cycle of life
I'm sick of stereotypes
(Yes I spelled Stereotype wrong)
Idiots are similar to Perverts
those two groups are at war
Idiots vs. Perverts
Yep
The ongoing battle
It will never cease
Perverts have greater numbers
because there are the neutral groups in them
yeah, well, im going to eat

No

Why did you put is as a ritual monster?
http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/4180/121199.jpg
okay cool
i'm good
hey...wait...where's the Cynder card?
lol
You mean CynDER
Cynder can go die
and the Ember card too...
*has one on other harddrive*
Bah. It's always about Cynder and Ember with you people.
O_O
How dare you!
http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/4180/121199.jpg Yay for MOAR POWAR
/me hates Ember
Cynder can NOT go die
/me hates Ember too
Ember sux
There are other and better females in the series
I'll do the Cynder, Guardian, Malefor etc ones tommorow.
*cough*cynder*cough*
Too lazeh
ehhh
Obviously
Cynder is overrated.
its so lonely
Nope
She's also a Mary-Sue
Nope
what is with all the Cynder haters
Every series needs a Mary-Sue
Nope
Ember is the Mary-sue
Hell, Spyro is a Mary-Sue. He never dies, has no weakness, has every element under his control, can stop time, the list goes on.
Yep
no wait rephrase that
Spyro is the Bob....
I guess Spyro and Cynder are perfect for each other. They're boh Mary-Sues.
*both
Lol
Gtg]
Bye
Bye
Unfortunantly, without having some sort of sue in a series, it isn't as good
I call em 'Nessisary sues'
You spelled necessary wrong
Whatever
I have spelling issues
:P
I'd say both
BOth are
Yep
O_o

Hello.
/me wonders whether he's the only one who notices the 'xxx'
XD
Nah, she uses that a lot doot
L:
And that doesn't worry you? :P
Unless she gives you 'favours'
...
/me has not been able to use this material for a LONG time
hah....
Wonder what SR will say about that
Satcey: Are ya sure? XD
RDX: Hey, loop-hole free, warned twice.
Kjerkings: Bleep.
you think he cares lol?
eh...he could swing wither way depending on his mood lol
"either"
BTW RDX, learn the difference between 'then' and 'than', 'your' and 'you're', and the three theres before claiming you're one of the three best in teh spyro FF section kthxbai.
Then it will just prove me right.
I love it when people do that
Makes my job a WHOLE lot easier.
He probably doesn't care about that either.
LOL
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
...
Seeing as how I don't go back and really reread any of my work before I post and don't fix anything after that
Like Dari said I really don't care lol
Spell checker would help though lol.
Could've been worse
spell check doesn't fix everything
nope
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
?

:)
Wtflol?
RDX might have gone absolutely mad and then another cyber war might start. FUN?
what would I go mad for?
lol
Sharon actually said something. :OMG
:P
he show you the SR one?
Dari: I'll die if you post that
/me falls over
lol
My writing has gotten much better as I go
But I should prolly double check my stuff
lol
I think she stares into space like I do XD
Guys...I'm going to post it
:)
Then I'm going to run as fast as I can away from here.
Well, he'll either ban you (Unlikely) or laugh.
Or some unpredictable SR thing.
I'll get kicked.
LOLOLOLOLOLOL

0 atk, 0 def
You're right
I'll change it
It should be WAY lower than that
....

Hehehe
brb
Have you got the sign for infinity?
:P
/ascii
Yes, it just gets fucked up when placed on a YuGiOh card
âˆž
lol
my card should be infinite attack XD
YOU'RE NOT GETTING A CARD
i didnt say i was
Could I get a card? I don't care what you do to it, I just want a good laugh.
lol
i dont care anyway
(Yes I want to laugh at myself)
....don't you want to insult me?
Not worth the effort
hes not going to do it, i was just joking when i said it anyway

Nope.

My uber-infinite powers show by my ability to make infinite signs on the yugioh card.
naunless you burn teh card with a flmaethrower
i mean
unless you burn the card with a flamethrower
Nope, you didn't have an argument
Yes
It's up there.
The fact that I manage to make an infinite sign proves that I win.
Becuase you can't
So you fail.
Bullshit. You're an idiot. I'm done talking to you.
you loose cause your card can be set on fire
LOL, see, you cannot come up with anything
You type up a list of profanities, then type up "owned, I'm ignoring you now" at the end.
Coming from YOU. YOU, KING OF LACK OF ARGUMENTS.
Oh my GOD.
You are a FUCKED UP person.
You swear at me, then call me an idiot, then ignore me.
That is not an argument.
That is more acknowledging defeat.
Backing down.
Then explained.
As to why I win.
You have to give me a chance to type up my side.
They are all fake, made on a fake card maker.
God.
"Your cards are faker than my fake cards"...
Nice.
Lol I have that slifer dragon god card somewhere
That is true, but yours doesn't even correspond to the game, or its rules. The (updated, last I checked) rules say there are only three ways to have a card with infinite attack and defence. Two of which are essentially the same. Yours is not one of them.
Its a fake but its been properly printed
Meh
The rules also state that you may only use official cards.
Does yours say over 9000 XD
None of which these are.
Ra>Obelisk
Ra does > Obelisk, but only in the right situations.
THEY ARE GOING TO MAUL THE TARDIS SOON D:

Meh, gunna log now. The high n00b density is annoying me
But I don't think that would go over too well with Congress...

He said if it was free...
It's free if you make a deal with someone.
Ugh screw it you're not worth the time right now

Ashley was never in armor when I played. White leather, yes. But not armor lol
If you beat it you can choose to have ashely in armor and leon in a tux
when ashely is in armor she cant be carried off, hurt or killed
its fun to watch one of those trolls pick her up and drop her
Didn't do that in mine
I beat it and got white leather.... different systems?
and if you purchased the Chicago *unlimited ammo machien gun* its fun to shoot her
What happens when people get carried off?

You act like one. :)
You would know.
Being one yourself.
Actually, my gym teacher is an obese farmer.
:p
And lots of people that live near me are.
A creepy guy called Obese_farmer says he's a vietnam war survivor and he's got a creepy old man avvie
The gym teacher who's affair with your mother coincided with you being conceived.
So I pick country talk up...unfortunately...
Wow.
Yeah, you really inherited his obese farmer traits.
...
Only Dari knows that those are
Just so you know

I thought it might've been you playing a joke or suttin
what obese farmer traits are#
I'm just spreading the word
Shhhiiitttttt
cyclone coming today
http://owlpages.info/fantasy/images/avatars/128330295849af66143701e.jpg
Acutally, she asked if I was.
winds up to 150km/h
To which I replied "no", as I am not.
:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
It's not true
:P
Shush
XD
I know right
so we arent going ot hear from things for a bit then with a cyclone coming his way
Things: You mean Homish?
He said his mother used to beat him with a baseball bat and that his dad smoked marajuana
Us: e__e
Things: Tie down your shed?
XD
*Hamish
He was crazy
Hamish isn't all that strong.
and he's an old man with a Mr. Mime pokemon poster....XDDDD
XDD
We believe it's just some person playing a joke
"my grandson who turned the big 14 yeers was showin me his computer"
Uh ye it is l;ol
Nope
Cat. 3 going on 3
er
*2
But the thing is
Not that strong
:p
We live behind a mountain
Ah
So even with Ellie, we got extremely high winds
even tho it was like 100km offshore
http://www.goes.noaa.gov/sohemi/SHGMSIR.JPG
And that was barely category 1, so I think Hamish will be a little more intense :x
It looks like its being sheared
It is
yeah
Thats whats keepin it growing
?
Being sheared is what weakens a cyclone.
Upper level winds are tearing at it
http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ65002.shtml
I live in Cairns
so its sposed to hit cat, 3 as it goes past
heh
You shouldn't get much in waves
cat3 is rated as a severe tropical cyclone tho lol
If you are inland a bit
Yeah
I'm sorta on the bottom of a hill
well elevated
But since you're by a mountain, you might get a lot of wind
We just get crazy winds coming down the hill
Yeah
It'll be a fun day at school atleast :P
lol
It's always boring here.
Meh.
it looks pretty strong on the satellite
Yeah
Ive been thru 2-3 cyclones
lol good old haven
XD
It doesn't have a well formed eye. That's typically the sign that a storm is strengthening
However, as it gets stronger, it may form one
Yeah
it only actually became a official cyclone last night
when will it hit where you are?
it's only been around < week
I gotta go
It won't hit
Bye everyone
It'll skirt the coastline
ok

She misunderstood you Kieran#
Then she should take the time to fucking read what's been posted.
Well, she was in a very pissy mood and stacey + pissy mood = Very stupid. She also doesnt look at things with thought when she's like that
Then it's her own fucking problem isn't it?
hey, that curry tasted of hell and piss!
Just happy chat, that's all she wanted
Then she can go chat in happy bouncy land, rather than the real world.
No sympathy
Kieran, just leave her alone then?
no. it isn't!!
Ignore her?
Fine, but if she starts oo-ing and aa-ing about whatever happened then I AM putting her in her place, got it?
No
Just set her on Ignore
No. If she starts oo-ing and aa-ing about whatever happened then I AM putting her in her place.

Dude, what did I say earlier?
I ONLY FOUND ONE SO FAR
the funny thing is earlier i said "what could go wrong" when she said she was cookign popcorn
I KNOW
lol
Who called me ages ago?
It's prolly your microwave or something
I ONLY FOUND ONE FAN
Actually try and do something rather than sit at a freaking computer and type out how your house is burning.
i didnt realise this would happen
XD
YES IT IS
LOL@DARI
Unplug everything in your kitchen. Noob
And then just open all your windows
what is the popcorn in?
microwave
or oven?
MICROWAVE
62
GUITAR HERO
FTW
FTW
UGh
MOOHAHAHA
/lol
...
COME ON YOU GUYS

Unplug everything in your kitchen. M_C
THAN JUST TURN ON A FAN
OPen all the windows
And maybe go outside
I DID
And call you mom/dad
AND DO WHAT
WAIT

WHY UNPLUG EVERYTHING
If there really was a fire, I can guarantee you you wouldn't be sitting at your computer typing.
*facepalm*
I'm done
That's it
I KNOW
BUT IT ISN'T
OH HOLY SHIT
/me leaves
...
BURN
What was that about?
A n00b was being n00bly
Someone emocializing about how their kitchen is smoky
You should have told her to find the can of petrol, and 'doused' the flames with it.
Aw man
doues*
douse*
XD
well, I knew what you meant XD
:P
:P
Hey
Hm, Things isn't on.
Maybe the cyclone got him?
*hopes*
jk
Lol
avio
avio?
Hihihihi, now I can't talk at all D:
stupid connection
/whois Things
/me is getting Ci Ci's tonight
Ci Ci's...?
Pizza
Oh.
/me eated pizza earlier
Lol, eated.
*ate
:p
Ci Ci's is okay =/
I only like their ham and cheese
I SAID EATED FOR A REASON! D:
lol,
and the brownies and cinnamin roles
*rolle
...
heheheh...
*rolles
Space cake
cinnamon*
CRAP
Just forget it.
XD
Lol.
Where I come from, its cinnamin
Get used to it.
:p
spelt with 2 i's?
Yep
Dunno why
Hm.
But all the places around here spell it like that
Nope
More or less, yeah
*better
Results 1 - 10 of about 19,200,000 for cinnamin. (0.22 seconds) Did you mean: cinnamon
thats true in a way
'better' as in better English?
Yep
Our's is more fun to say
It is not better.
It is stupid.
not in my opinion
Not as proper
It sounds stupid.
Nope
We have about 20 accents
None sound the same
I always hear the same annoying one.
i went to new york once and everyone kept saying oh my god every minute
Yeah, it depends on what state you're from right?
Especially with kids.
it was so annoying
There's different kinds of accent in the UK too doot
:p
I never said there wasn't
yeah thats true
not a good way to introduce me to it XD
no offence
New York sucks
To many preppy dumba**es
thats true from the OMG thing
my sister wanted to go to the pokemon centre in new york XD
casue she saw it on an old pokemon video i think
and idiots
I cannot argue against that
from top gear
but never mind
back.
its the same in the UK to, different accents different attitudes
in essex everyone tarts up their cars
so its like a rubbish car with an expensive body kit and a 30,000 stereo
Can I ask, what is worse for Prep: California or New York
*preps
I have many people that go to my school that have British and Austrailian accents. So I pick it up
California
Lydd is full of Pikeys and a few chavs
My best fwiend is from NY
California
im saying new york as i visted new york XD
Depending on what city
I'm glad I don't live IN lydd, I live outside it
Lydd is full of chavs
New York City is much worse than California
So that means, Nigel, is a chav
But overall California is worse
And he's from California
Preppy Chav?
NY isn't preppy
California is
Full of all the anorexic blonde chicks you'll ever see.
New York has all the suicidal people
and Business men
which I hate
I wish I wish with all my heart to fly with dragons in a land apart!
=P
I remember that show
oh my lord that was scary
so what happened with the smoke?
no one would pick up the phone so i emailed my dad then he called me and i turned on a fan on the microwave
ARGH
LET'S GO TO THE RAINBOW CANYON!
8DDDDD
dang connection went
...
Since he doesn't exist, you crash to the ground
WAAAAAAAAAAAAH
no one would pick up the phone so i emailed my dad then he called me and i turned on a fan on the microwave
oh so alls ok now

]he said it was gonna be okay that i turned on the microwave fan
Nuuu

Curse the duct-tape
brb

hm
Ok
i did
and doors
kk
It doesn't have to be perfect though you know haha
i hope it works
i got windows and doors open and fans on
ok
the reason why i said the s word at the end then left was because i thought something was on fire but really it was just the sun reflecting light on a plant
uh oh...
lol well its all ok now
when my mom finds out she's gonna go all "lovey-dovey" on me saying are you ok are you ok?
brb
XD have fun then
NOOO

Heard his name before, no clue who it is rhough..
james may is a person off top gear
look at the image
each of the red word makes a message

he got fired for doing that XD but its clever
So you think it's really good, yeah? You should try making the bloody thing up. It's a real pain in the arse.
thats what each of the red letters make up to say in that image
I read it =P
kk XD
me too
he got fired for it but a cool way to get fired though
For a random change of topic, my favorite video game quote is in Dino Crisis. "This isn't a joke, you idiot. We just got attacked by a big-ass lizard!"

XD
lol
it's not funny you know
well whatever bye jerks
Noob
what the hell happened with her
what did you guys give her shit for now lol
lol well
she was making popcorn
and it caught fire sort of
but mostly with smokle
and she had caps lock on asking us how should she sort it
she eventually sorted the smoke out though
pop corn was ruined however
wow
it's the end of the freaking world cause you burned your popcorn
XD funny though as i had said before the smoke "something is going to go wrong"
but i only meant it as a joke
hm
She still fails
How do you fuck up popcorn? o_e
lol how she did it i guess
shes only 10 as she said her 11th birthday was soon
XD but still a normal 10 year old can still make pop corn
she prolly just put it in the microwave wrong
my sis can and shes 10
yeah mostly probaly
left the metal wrapping on
XD
..... *must eat different popcorn*
lol
I burned oatmeal before.
I like burning playstation disks
microwave or oven did you burn it in?
SR: ... wow xD
Stove

/me can see a hopeful SR smiling as he is about to get his outmeal. Then his dreams shatter as the oatmeal blackens.
/me then goes back to killing annoying peasants in creed
A.C.'s awesome xD

...random....uhhh... 10
9
...
7
<.<
Maybe 8
3000
XD No! 50... JK, 16
I don't really care at the moment
lol
you don't act like your sixteen
And...
exactly..
what n00b
"You look like Jackie Chan"
I look like Jesus
You don't even know what I look like
>.>
How am I a n00b
I haven't even done anything yet
How do you know that we don't know what you look like
hmm
I'll be able to tell in the next 10 minutes
Because it's not logical
?
what rdx?
don't go there with me and logic
I'm good at playing mind games.....sometimes
Yeah right
Lier
Everything is possible, because anything is possible!
Yah? Prove it.
n00v
its just a matter of, "Can you accomplish it."
*n00b
Shut up
Bitch please
trust me....
I live in the U.S.A.
I'm not a girl
I have every right to talk
And I really don't care
My pimp hand is way strong,
xD
n00b
I meant that I will be able to tell if they are a n00b in ten minutes
because she would be shoving n00b down your throat lol
Sure whatever
yes she would...
Who is she?
a moderator
Well, you are. Can you hack in three different languages? xD
...
she can drive me insane, and then throw me out of here because I'm annoying her
Wellm that's gay
she can do anythinf if you piss her off
*well
gay?
Wow
Aice's just THAT cool
you may not want to say that with SR hovering around :P
And? I never said I did anything =P
you know, I don't recall being intimidated like this when I first came in here...
so/
?
>.>
So? Swearing is allowed
I know
That's what I'm proving
Alright then
brb, have to brush my teeth...
why are you trying to prove the obvious lol
Geek
There really wasn't any point to prove there
But whatever
And yes
XD
I am a geek
no not you
He is a geek
So?\
He's brushing his teeth
I do that too
I don't know
Yeah but
I brush my teeth to
Why now?
does that make me a geek lol
At 7:00
Because it's night-time
it's 10:00 over here
7:00? maybe where you live
Obviously we're in different timezones
and it's 10 where he is
I brush mine RIGHT before to bed
Well stil, 10:00, are you kidding me
I can't be arsed to do that alot of the time, so I usually brush mine early to
And so?
some poeple actually do go to bed at a sane hour believe it or not
I'm a geek just because I brush my teeth eh?
lol
its eight o'clock here where I live...
I go to bed around 1:00
LOL
I thought you lived on the eastern board
I go to bed around 7 A.M.
8:00!
LOL
On days off anyways
7:00am!
I'm not going to bed, I'm just getting it out of the way
LOLOLOLOL
<.<
?
well that'd stupid
why are you laughing at random times?
what if you want to eat something
what makes you think he would?
I've already eaten dinner, and I've had pie
so my stomach is satisfied
That's why I don't brush my teeth till the last minute
Then you eat something, and you deal with it when you wake up, noob
hm
Well Red, is he?
arguing about freaking brushing teeth
yeah this is sad lol
well, we apparenlty have nothing better to do
Yes he is a n00b
no he doesn't
lol
Yeah but when I eat my dinner, I don't eat it all, because I snack, then I stay up late, then I get hungry again
I label people whatever the hell I feel like labeling them
/me labels Zephr-kun a labeler
I do admit I'm a geek
lol
He's a n00b though
N00BZ!!11one
No, I get off the computer around 10 then go to bed around 1:00 watching TV
....
How come people are one but never talk!
Huh....
I go to bed when I damn well feel like it
Same here
I don't have that option
but seeing as how I do have actual responsibilities they have to be reasonable
I really have no rules
then again red, you're older then all of us
But I mostly feel like it at 1:00 in the morning
yes
that's true
I don't have to do chores, go to bed at a certain time, and I can go anywhere I want on the weekends
I don't even have to do my homework when I go home
god help you the day you have to get a job lol
That's why I said I'm a geek
A geek at school...
But I'm still outgoing
wait until your out on your own
I've been practicing this, I'll be fine
been practicing what/
?
being on your own?
how old are you dare I ask
Who knows, I might still be on here when I turn 20!
/me yawns loudly
I already told you
16
I wasn't watching
I have a plan....its already set, I'm just waiting for everything to fall into place (Which it tends to do as such for me)
I doubt it
so you have a plan all layed out and know where you want to go?
Life sucks
yes
you know how to manage your assets and balance your budgets
I don't know that yet
yes
I just have to have everything set up very quickly....once its begun
you know how to act in a business relationship and with active consumers
But when I move out I plan to go to live in an apartment at Seattle
yes
Then I will move out to a house when I get a good job that pays and enough money
so you plan to move to an apartment
with what money to begin with?...Seeing as how in todays market
it's very hard to get a job to begin with
so you could be up to your eyes in debt already and have no job
I already have one, my brother was a good role model for me, I think I'm gonna take is path around life
you already have a what? You're not telling me anything lol
and you didn't answer my question
through life not around lol
What question?
how are you going to get an aparment with no money and when you don't have a job to begin with
jeez rdx, stop grilling the poor kid
and seeing as how jobs are going to be harder to get
what are you going to do to find one
I'm not grilling him lol
I told you I will take my brothers path through life
Believe me if I was this would be much worse
That's not an answer
He got a job at 13
I already have a job
doing what
Now I am going on to bigger jobs
and please tell me how it will cover the rising rent costs
Didn't I just say that
Don't worry, it pays
I have 3 jobs
Psht
Really what are they
My ass
I work at Albertsons, I baby-sit, but the biggest one is I work at RGIS
and what is your income from each
What do you mean
HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE
Oh I though you meant something else sorry
working at a store takes up quite a bit of time...I know, I've worked at two before...
income=cash flow
I make 10 bucks an hour at Albertsons
my ass
I get 15 bucks an hour on baby-sitting (10 year old)
Bull sheed
I'm I the youngest here?
And I get 100 bucks at RGIS (every week)
Dude I get 700 bucks a week from my job lol
that's nothing to brag about
Well your 20
Like I said, I'm moving on to bigger jobs now
like what
what makes you eligable for a better job
because if it's without a degree its gonna be about attitude and work ethic
I'm quitting baby-sitting when I get a good job, and that good job I am getting in a week
what is it
and what would that job be?
Don't worry, I got one, I made it
That's not an answer
what is it
gspyro66
shit
Umpiring and Working at AFC
Rdx, I do not what you call grilling, but I'd say this counts
I has Sony Vegas Pro 8 :D
this is not grilling when I'm asking the kid what he is going to do to make a living in his world
according to you
eee
even though because of my conservative attitude pretty much everyone counts it as grilling
I don't care how sensitive people are
Umpiring gives 40 bucks a game, and AFC pays 1000 a week
I noticed.
So what's the convo about?
Our path through life
I call what RDX is doing simply asking questions o_e
Rdx grilling some kid about his future
and seeing as how I have said nothing insulting then I'm fine
Bye.
later Icy
The world would be better off with a little mor "grilling" anyways
damn...
..
True
Kay bye
XD
Hey nice to meet you Aiceb
I've heard "good" things about you
holy lag
Ok?
lag indeed
DAAAAAAMN!
what happened?
Hi
what is lag? no one told me yet
Oh hi
"good things"?
WTH?
anyways...we were just talking about what this newbie is planning to do with his future
they just told pika that if he got on your bad side you'd ban him
...
Everyone said you were really easy to make mad, but I don't think that, you look nice
Guys, I'm not a bitch...:(
brb
they just wanted to warn him, seeing as they thought he would bug you
didn't want this ending up like yesterday I imagine.
Always a possibility
back
what happened yesterday?
What'd I miss
anyways that was far from grilling. That was just asking questions
Daylight savings time begins on March 8th YAY!!!!
You know, what jobs we're gonna have, and other stuff
I guess I did miss something
NO!!!
More school!
NOOO
What's school?
XD
-.-'
Seriously
People never answer me
:(
I don't belive that
*believe
w/e Rdx
...
:(
we have answered that question....I think...
It's a place where you get edication and get good jobs so you don't live in a box when you grow up
lol, good answer
You can go places without school. It was much harder to do 5 years ago then it was today....but it's not the end of the world if you don't get a degree
I assume he doesn't mean higher level school
but idk
/me opens his mouth to speak, but then closes it, forgeting what he was going to say
I'm talking about College
ohhhh, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is on.....
/me goes to watch the movie
It could get lower.
|Hey
Wilma was 882 in 2005
I think it went back up
but it still pretty lol
Speed of Movement: 9 knots [17 km/h]
Maximum 10-Minute Wind: 115 knots [215 km/h]
Maximum 3-Second Wind Gust: 160 knots [295 km/h]
Central Pressure: 930 hPa
215km/h winds continous would be crazeh
haha wow
Hamish is pretty small in size
but powerful lol
hm
Do you want it to get lower?
Or higher?
Well
I would say higher.
people in that area want it to get higher :P
yea lol
Would be sorta cool :P
Woah
http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/aug2007/tropcyc12.jpg
I want it to get lower, turn around, and come over the top of my house :D
Tip was huge
:O
Cyclones can be really severe too sometimes
:P
I mean like SO severe that everyone there dies.
Hamish? That cyclone? Ah. xD
lolol
Hamish went by us
If you are dumb enough to stay on the coast when a category 5 is going to hit, you don't deserve to live. lol
Severe Tornadoes happen here too o.O
But steered out west at the last second :P
hahaha
I would be down the beach watching it man
:D
/me likes cyclones
/me likes windyness mainly
HOLY CRAP F5 TORNADO O_O http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/f5-tornado.jpg
/me likes tornadoes best :D
/me pictures things flying a kite while everyone else is screaming and running about
*stunt kite
Lol
bbl
tornado's are much worse that cyclones
I have magical powers
Well
in a way
:P
Oh no....http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg
Tornadoes are smaller, so they don't cause as much destruction
Yes.
But they cause more destruction to objects
Like houses when they get hit
Tornadoes killed over 90,000 people in just one place before. Livestock,builidings,fences,homes and almost everything in the tornadoe's path was destroyed.
Oh no....http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg
Not one tornado...
Who here has heard of the Tri-State tornado?
Oh no definetly not.
They're too tiny to kill 90,000 people
I have
Hahhaahhahahahaa I love England
Hamish is almost acheiving that
but it had an insanely low pressure
Multiple tornadoes like this http://www.uwm.edu/~kahl/Images/Weather/Severe/multiple_tornadoes.jpg That isnt the exact picture, but it was multiple tornadoes
It was really severe and bad. and I mean B-A-D.
Oh god it has an eye now.
There's no way...90,000 people.
Where did you get that info?
well somewhere around that 50,000 mabye?
Since when does the average person have a sense of logic lol
The tri-state tornado, only 695 people were killed
I saw it in my Science Book at school x3
But the Tri-state tornado was the worst tornado in US history
But volcano eruptions are MAJORLY different...
Your Science book was wrong
Volcanoes kill like....90,000 people.
I was reading in Natural Disasters.
No.....
A volcano killed 90,000 people.
It said it in my book...the BIG eruption.
Volcano- Around 90,000
Tornado- Around 10,000
The biggest volcano eruption killed 92,000.
They rarely are deadly
Most are.
Tornados NEVER kill 10,000
Most aren't
Volcanoes can ooze like soft-serve-icecream. Or explode crazily.
I wanna go poke sum lava
Good luck.
Yeah, but most eruptions are small
When you get near the Earth's core. You'll burn up.
They rarely kill
True.
When you get near the Earth's core. You'll burn up. Things.
meh im gunna go to bed, i'll watch utube tommoz and see who gets smashed overnight lol
The largest Volcano killed 92,000 and that was mostly due to starvation
I already said that....
:p
You can burn up in the hot mantle melted rock too.
you didn't say because of starvation lol
If you get close enough to the melted rock.
Boom. Your gone.
The biggest single was the tri-state tornado
No I do not.
bbl
Around 10,000.
Yeah if you find a group of 10,000 morons...and bunch them together in a torando's path
....
yeah it might kill them lol
XD
To bad Spyrochat doesn't have 10,000 members
torando lol
bbl nao
lol
LOL
sleep tiem
we only have 2,800 and prolly 30 of them have ever used this
You said: "Tornado- Around 10,000"
My New Website http://www.mibbit.com/url/wCA42E
Then you denied saying it....
Yea.
I said
AROUND 10,000
I know a group of Morons....or shall I say Idiots....
Not 10,000.
Not exactky.
My New Website http://www.mibbit.com/url/wCA42E Check it out

Freewebs.

Nope.

That's not what your room says
Oh, and saying that a page on freewebs is your own website is like saying http://www.spyroforum.com, and http://www.spyroforum.com/forum-announcements.html are different sites.
They aren't.

site
Im not arguing
/me ignores whatever else.
BTW!
You are just 3 steps away from growing your very own site.
freewebs says
:P my site.
They lie.
They make idiots like you feel big.
Orly?
So they can advertise on your page and make money out of idiots such as yourself.
No.
Yes.
-.-
Its for site hosting.
Free.
It is free, because they put adverts on your page.
Which they make money out of.
O_o
Which is why the more page views you get, the more stuff, space, etc, you are allowed to use/get.
Whatever.
Other people who have s scrap of sense can argue with me
But with someone as stupid as you, there really is no point.
-.-

You're acting like a child
Me? I'm 13 lol
And so is he
that orange is giving me a headache or so spelling like that cya
LOLOLOLOL he's 13???
yes
A few months older than me
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!
Yes, and I'm not the one spamming lol.
One lol is enough
jesus
It's too funny!
How exactly am I acting like a child, by getting irritated that I have to say everything three times for you?
It's way too funny for just one lol!
It's just a fun way to annoy you
you're just asking for it
*!
From who? A 13 year old kid!
Congratulations, you just got moved up a few places in the line. You'll still have to wait though I'm afraid.
Why should I care
who at this moment is acting mre intelligent then yo u
And I think the KFC is here...
RDX: It's the internet, you're not supposed to act intellegent..... ESCPECIALLY KIDS...
anyone like the song "Love comes"
<3
Who is it by.
I love that song.
Dunno...
Dx
nvhoi
oh wait
Why can't people act intelligent on the internet?
stands for: never heard of it
as far as I know they have the right to do so if they want
i never said they can't
so it's a bad thing for someone who is 13 to act intelligent?
im just saying it's weird and creepy 0_o
http://static2.sexysims2.com:443/customavatars/avatar592407_3.gif
Lol
rawrbetch
Excuse me, calling me a kid on the internet is a void point. Physical age is moot on the internet, where only psychological age counts. I'm, mentally, older than a LOT of people on here, and especially you.
Same
and I agree
its by David
And I apologise that you live in such an illiterate, idiotic society where anyone underneath the age of 20 showing any signs of intelligence at all is creepy. So, you can shut the fuck up now, because you just got pwned.
David "Idontknowhislastname"
Umm, excuse me(XD), but you're acting a little too old for your age. (lol)
it's amazing....
Arhuleta, Cook?
But
theres plenty davids
so cant identify him with his first name only
o_o
Yes, you've just been pwned by every intelligent member of this chatroom. I'm done talking to you, because I can see future conversations will only bring immature responses and idiotic arguments.
What I miss?
Pwning the n00b.
hm
I don't care, it's a freaking internet, I personally think it's impossible to act intelligent on the internet because you can't prove nothing on the internet only if you got pictures with labels and diagrams. No diagrams, hm... Guess not... PWNAGE!
No, not pwnage.
Yes, yes pwnage
hey
You can't string together a bunch of words and call it an argument and pwnage. You sir, are a fucking moron.
seriously every sentence you say makes us dumber
/me edits her website
O_o
Probably is
x3
DEW IT 8DDDD
Every sentence on here (except for mine it's not logical) makes everyone dummber
Whatever your doing...DEW IT
and generally not caring
*not everyone me sry
don't even care no mores
Or just de-voice?
I'm done so whatever
Watch what you say in this chatroom
-.-
o_o
My proof is that you have no reason to be acting like you are, AND you have no reason to back up your explanation. Therfore, you are not "pwning" anyone, because you are pretty much full of bullshit and purposely acting more immature than you should be. The only way to be respected here is to be intelligent and mature. If you can't do that, you might as well get your ass off of this chatroom.
I know I'm watching out, that's why I'm ending it
/me isnt interuppting.
hi
hm
...=P
Oh god no...not ANOTHER CYNDER
nickname
OP
/me bashes his head on the keyboard 15000 times
what...?
Now he's sucking up
I think that she may be hypocritical and unfair at times (Who isn't), but she has you here
There's only one cynder what are you talking about (on the chat)
yup
he did that last night
doesn't surprise me
fhfhfhfhfhhffhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfhfh
No spam :/
Sorry
Im just warning her.
5 minutes later...
Not cussing is just being a goody-goody. People swear in life. Get used to it.
I already have... (with you)
Is malefor included too?
>_>
But whatever I'm done... *i'm being quiet now for like 3 mins or something i need to cool off from the last two battles*
wow lol
XD
/me has a tendancy to hate everyone and hid ein the corner, plotting everyone's murder
Battles? If you battle with me, you will know it. That, that was a minor rub.
must have fried his brain
With what, baby 13 year old powers?
JK
XD
not really
not really at all
JK
kay im bored
little late for that
Oh just, very clever.../
as much as I would love to stay and watch this idiot try to act intelligent I have watch duty
bbl
Hah. You are so ignorant. Trust me, I can take you down if I so have the inclanation.
I disagree with people who call newbies to sites "n00bs". They are not n00bs. They are new to the site, and need some help. It does NOT mean they are "help beggers" or whatever you call them. [Random Off Topic.] [But it is true..]
he means you
x3
the lacking of knowing that proves his point
*Random*
The other night SR said that the next person to say the N word was gonna be banned so...
D:
No please
Nobody told me.
Dx
No-one told me about that.
DX
I haven't even cussed yet
I won't say it anymore.
No-one says fucking 'cuss' besides total retards.
XD
So?

"SR: Who stole my rainbow laser?"
Hello M'lady
(Why does this sound rather odd?!)
"Hehehehehe---...A hammet of cake...?" -Peter Griffin
=P
/me facepalms
guys may i have your opinions on something?
Sure
no
if it's about your site then no
no one wants to hear it
if i were to make a forum logo should i put that i made it at the botto- nevermind
MY shift key is acting up again..
lol
<>_<>
SHH , M'Lady is speaking
*Kitteh
No need
*Kitteh
No, she silenced
Oh
If it's your site, it's implied that you made it
Ok kitteh
Just put some copyright stuff in the footer or something, like SF
SHould I just shut up?
if you want to if you dont wanna then dont
Your choice x3
/me drinks her Co-Co-Cola
Hmm...
Good idea, I'll find mine
Hey
Still watching the cyclone's progress?
I had a crushed empty coke bottle in my closet before....brown stains all over the shelves
hm
I was like WTF!? HOW!?!!!
I disabled your PMs on SF
WHy?
WTH?
Why me?
I think you could probably guess why
STupid shift
Why?
I didn't do anything.
...
I haven't used PM in ages
I didnt do anyting.
*anything
Oh.
xD
The Yugioh cards
What?
Coke or -- BAHAHHAHAHA
I never posted those to SF
What is wrong with showing Yugioh Cards?!
Can I just say.. GUTTED
What?
I never agreed to that.
Mars Milkshake or Coke?
I cant have both, I would if I could
So I temporarily disabled it just in case
Blame him, not be.
*me
I still don't see what I've done wrong.
beebeebee.....8D
I never told anyone to PM me anything.
Dari didn't do anything.
I made the card but never sent it to anyone
Either way, I want to see that card before you start sending it out to people
I NEVER DID
I KNOW
I never did anything
URGH THAT IS DISTGUSTING.
But you were apparently involved in the creation of said card
Okay, I hate that milkshakes
Distgusting?
I did.
Whatever dari
Hmm
But you are accusing me of thinking of sending it to people
Guyz...
And I don't particularly appreciate that very much
Which I never did or said I would
I'm not though
"Go, Die, Go, Go" = "Go Diego Go!"
You are
I disabled the PMs so you wouldn't
You implied he was going to start sending it.
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I never said whether you had or not
I NEVER SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO SEND IT
That's why I'm telling you guys now
I KNOW, NOW TURN OFF THE FREAKING CAPS LOCK
You agree that I never said that I would send it?
The thing said to PM you, so I assumed that you would if someone asked you
So I disabled it to be safe
I never would send that
If you swear you're not going to, I'll give it back
I swear I won't
That's why I'm telling you now, so there won't be issues with it later
I never sent it to anyone, nor to I plan to
OK, good
Well, someone's touchy today
LOL
Bloomin heck, how the heck are you ment to get the caps off of Coke bottles?!
Or she's in a bad mood because SR wouldn't show her his laser.
Forget that
You aren't.

DAMMIT
Awesome

Then he is a douchebag
Looks like I'm up for a few more hours
I need coke just to get to sleep
=/
I should send you a message on SF talking about some plan to reveal some terrible thing about him. Then he'll be paranoid
I don't think I have ever put a bloody picture on dA before
He started to piss me off
Being annoying and shadowy
Treating me like I'm stupid
Although I don't dislike him
He's a good admin
He's just not my favorite member
Oh
Oh crap
I have an evil idea
Coke coming through my nose
CARBONATE IT BURNS

Never heard of either.
hmmm what else
what's the differ between pepsi and coka-cola
We have began to sell a new Powerade Flavor
Sour Melon
and Powerade now has new logos
Coca-Cola make powerade? O_o

We have also come out with three new Desani Water designs
I'm sorry RDX.

And...
Oh crap
The rhino is here

There was only a Pepsi

Rhino's my brother XD

Coke and all supporting flavours now come in new 16 oz. cans
Oh goodie. Showdown tomorrow.

Dari: You'll have no idea what I'm talking about.
Nope.

Duke plays UNC tomorrow
My dad drinks coca-cola
which seniors love to waste money on
Oh.

I drink those 8oz cans

They don't allow outside drinks, so I hid 4 of those in my jacket

Woah, epilepsy.
OMG YAY =D
If you haven't heard of the game, nevermind.
I saw someone with your name
I'm supposed to be downloading Gunz at some point.... at least, that's what a guy at school said xD
Gunz is good...If you play it well.
Because for some reason, everyone has multiple characters, so all the amazingly good people play with all the new people.
So the new people never have a chance, really.
lol
Yeah.... one of the guys at my school's a hacker on it
There are no hacks for the version I play.
:P
lol
All got patched.
*goes to download*
He hacks it himself, but I really haven't asked him about it in a while
Apparently I got the 3rd highest number of points in one match.
In the clan.
Nice
O_o
I didn't know that.
Weird.
Yeah
No I don't play it
Lol.
Ok.
I know
THAT is what he hacks
Hm.
There is also NA gunz, etc.
Yeah, I asked. It's ijji
Lol.... hope I have enough space on my small-ass hard drive
It's not much of a download.
Takes about 20 minutes.
Maybe 10.
Eh... I've only got 2 gigs left..... damn 20 gig hard drive >_<
Lol.
Buy a 200 gig flash drive.
It should be aroun 40-50£
£40-50*
Around*
flash? Get yo info together boa, 'cuz flash drives go, absolute top, 40 gigs
(Yes..... that was n00b typing)
hard drive then.
Really not much difference.
I'm getting a 1.5 terra external at some point soon. Not exactly sure when though
And yes, there is a very large difference
Between flash drives and hard drives
Not anything that matters in the context I used it in.
Eh, you can get people that slightly know computers confused and... well..... have them looking for a 200 gig flash drive
It be different if you were talking external harddrives. Those and flash drives are pretty similar
Lol, I suppose.
I am talking external.
Lawl.
xD Yeah, I'
(Damn enter button o_a)
Yeah, lol.
Like I said, I'm getting a 1.5 terabyte external within the next 2 months. It's oddly small, too xD
Hm, nice.
Only, like... $140 or somewhere around there, too
Cool.

But it is also bad for your health
So I take breaks.
For family.
For food and drink.
I can never bother to take breaks..
For other things.
You want a Real Ninja song!

Trust me
If you went on the whole day

You would take breaks.

You would cry if your power went out!
Lol
/me doesn't die.
I am not messing around.
I am not one for playing games.
Well...your playing games on a computer now...
hehehe
No.
I am on Forums/.
I've lost my creativity ever since I haven't been allowed to go online or use my PS..
And this chat.
That is why I am trying to get back on track.
So I socialize with real people I actually know again.
And..
Ugh
So that I don't have health problems and depression when I get off my laptop.
XD
It can be mental problems first.
All I do all day is watch TV,play on my keyboard or drum for a bit and do my homework..
Then it can lead to *PHYSICAL* problems.
I am not trying to be a wise person.
I am just saying.
Here are some cute boys without their shirts who are HILARIOUS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMIs71ze5Ag
You don't want to turn out like that do you?
Hate the whole world? Love your computer/laptop to death but act like you hate the whole world when you're off it?
I just want the freedom back..
Well that is what CAN happen.
It's not happening to me..
Look, right now...I was screwed over in life....I've withdrawn from society for a little bit
Anyway,I'm gonna go now

Kieran, have any pictures of dead bodies? (Not zombies)
Have you ever noticed how in Hollywood, people can outrun the Earth's rotation, yet they can't outrun zombies moving at a half mile per hour?
Guy: Thats true, come to think of it
OOOOH
People can outrun the earth's rotation?
Chuck Norris can, supposedly
No, he can't.
Chuck Norris can outrun the speed of light.
Doctor does the can can
According to Hollywood, anyone can outrun the Earth's rotation.

Imma kill off some of my minor fan chars soon
He had no idea which panel could've had the mine.
LOL
Remember, killing someone off does not instantly make a good story.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5ZU2Rlphr8&eurl=http://www.mibbit.com/chat/&feature=player_embedded Watch it
I'm making my own story.
I'm trying not to kill off someone just because I think it'd make a good story.
I liked the book Shiloh and the movie Hancock because they DIDN'T take the easy way to good ratings by killing off a main character.
Bleh. My oatmeal is too watery.
Not that I hate sad endings, but it's seriously becoming cliche.
I agree
There is a death in my story
/me is desperately trying not to shoot teh fucking huge alien spacecraft on the TV
Not all that bad though.
LOL!
That's okay, as long as the death actually makes the story better, and is not done just for the sake of sadness or whatever.
"I want a HAPPY ending<3" -cliche love icon I saw the other day =P
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByNewberyMedal
Aliens invoke ALMOST the same intense reflexes as zombies. I just want to shoot them with something bigger.
18:36 Guy Remember, killing someone off does not instantly make a good story. I did say minor and BTW its part of the plot XD
The death in my story isn't that major at all
I see, I just don't want to see another writer caught up in believing that death = INSTA GOOD STORY
Yeah, I did kill off one of my main characters midway through my comic so I can juice up the ending a bit XD
hihi
When I'm thinking of killing off a character, I ask myself something.
What?
"What point does this death serve?"
AM I GOING MAD?!
Aw.
If it's nothing other than "to make the reader sad" then I don't do it.
I asked myself when I killed off Scaraffu
But I won't say why :D
:/
Kissup.
Lol
...
Suckup
Exactly.
That reminds me, I haven't kissed up to you in a while.
Wooooow
Lol?
There we go.
People who really gave a shit about my birthday at least told me on the day of my birthday instead of a few weeks after
Guy: Good for you chap
Ah, I forgot about your birthday.
Oh, yeah, I also forgot that I've been on SF for one year about 6 days ago.
15th and I've been there a year
When there's a fire, you stop, drop, and roll. When there's a Chuck Norris, you stop, drop, and die.
Wait, did I forget about your birthday?
On April 21st I'll have been here for two years. :D
I though I forgot about my cousin's birthday and it turns out I remembered it.
thought*
When there's a fire, you stop, drop, and roll. When there's a Chuck Norris, you stop, drop, and die.
I sometimes actually forget when my own birthday is, no matter how bizarre that sounds.
Chuck Norris can unscramble an egg.
:O
Y'all are getting old
Chuck Norris sucks
I said it
# # Chuck Norris beat the Sun in a staring contest.

As far as I know, I have no mental disabilities. Therefore, I declare your statement to be false.
As far as you know.

Retarded can also mean slow learning. I'm sure you have been slow at learning something.

Chuck Norris can strike a match on a bar of soap.
Chuck Norris is allowed to talk about Fight Club.
Niagra Falls is the result of one of Chuck's legendary cannon balls.
Chuck Norris lost both his legs in a car accident....and still managed to walk it off.

When Chuck Norris throws a boomerang, the boomerang does not return because it is scared to come back.
Okay, I'll stop.
No where to run

Even Chuck Norris couldn't escape it
Aah yes, but telekinetic shields can hold back nuclear shockwaves if the individual has a weak-medium mind.

"Spyro darling, how have you been going?! *giggle* well I musn't take too much time, confidence, you know!" -Elder Magnus
I master them in under 20.

I killed a flag carrier by falling on top of them.

That would suck
And that's, ah, all I've got so far

Admit it. In the moments when you are alone together you call him Jeevsy-kins
/me buys Dari
They once bid $2400 on a cardboard box on there.
The ultimate way to sell anything on eBay is to say that a celebrity used it.
Dari belongs to me and the evil overlords.
Someone sold a half eaten sandwhich and got 10 bucks for it
(:
Then you open up his shirt and run your fingers over his Edward-like chest
"A celebrity pissed on this item."
SR is obsessed with Edward
he did! 8POINTS TO A GEICO*
GEICO?

He ruined a perfectly fine blocked face.
You know you loved it

So yeah
It's funny how everyone stops talking when SR comes in.
Yeah

Lol.
The egotistical bastard must think it's because we're constantly talking about him :D

He even has the message pretyped.
He doesn't actually talk to me anymore =P
LOL
Sure.

No, it is true
I said "sure"

Maybe he's having an affair?

HOLY SHIT
AWAY WORKS NOW
ON MIBBIT
THEY FIXED IT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
/me doesn't care.
It always worked for me.
/me shrug.
Okay, I think I need to find more of those quizzes
hm...must be in computer class
yeah
-_-
I'm really annoyed right now
that's not good
the people in my group are making me do all of yesterday's work again.
Aargh
And of course they won't listen to any of my suggestions....
why don't you make them do the work lol
because we get graded on how well we worked as a group
I'm screwed for that part, I guess
/me hates dreamweaver and wants it to die right now
so you have to do the work because you have the lowest grade?
Nah, we're all supposed to do equal work
I probably do have the lowest grade though XD
I hate this clss
*class
I would make them do most of the work lol
Haha... I wish
You don't like my work, do it yourself
:P
hang on dreamweaver?
im good at that
:D
I hate dreamweaver
Notepad ftw
nah i hate notepad
dreamweaver FTW!
hm
T_T
No.
Just no.
ok well ur more used to notepad, im more used to dreamweaver really
I don't even know what it is lol
I'd rather work with code than dreamweaver anyday
macromedia dreamwevaer is a website creation software
nah the codings confuse me
ppsst
well sometimes
I'm too lazy to do that stuff
Yeah, I can do so many things on notepad that dreamweaver could never do
:P
i can cope with it, but to much and i cant cope
well just use teh coding part on dreamweaver XP
I would
But the teacher yells at me
why?
Because she wants us all to use dreamweaver :P
hmmm
k
wow it is working again lol
Ah, cool
Why did that get taken off again?
oh i thought you meant she was shouting at you for using the coding option on dreamweaver
Yeah, she was
No coding allowed
what? thats a bit harsh
what would happen if you did use it
Well
She'd probably call me up to the front of the class again
And ask why I'm making this so hard on myself
:P
Say "Because I like it hard" and see who gets it!
lol
Crap
but isnt it better if you do soemthing which you are best at?
Hehehe
Wewt
:P
(That's a good thing? =P)
In my world :D
KNEE-ON! APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE MID-UPPER KNEECAP
KNEE-ON! APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE MID-UPPER KNEECAP
KNEE-ON! APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE MID-UPPER KNEECAP
:D
i still dont get why your teacher wont let you do something your good at which is coding as you said i think
I dunno
Back.
Break.
That's what all the professionals are doing now, apparently =/
Hell.
Hell.
Wow.
I just played through the entire Gears of War campaign in like two hours.
Pwn.
well personally i would just do what im best at really
and everyone if different with how they work, a bit thick why your teacher dosent realise that
Yeah?
Have you played through Gears of War's campaign?
I haven't got the game, so no.
cya later everyone
i gtg
Wow that took a long time to update....

There's usually more
ok
You should've been here awhile ago
why?
They all left not too long ago
depends on the day
sometimes we have as many as 20 on
thats not much
all trying to talk in here at once lol...it's pretty entertaining
ok...
it's WILLD
It's a PARTY
w00t!
*moshes*
you can hardly have a party in a chatroom...
Yes you can
no you cant
Stop being so wannabe emo
D:
im not emo
you can in a chatroom way lol
youre an emo
O_o
WE HAVE a WANNABE DEPRESSED DUDE SAYING WE CAN'T PARTY IN A CHATROOM DDD:
this fails...
Well, he should lighten up
See look
wannbe depressed dude
"this fails"
im not depressed...
this fails...I find this damn entertaining most of the time lol
but this fails
Then why are you ehre?
shouldnt you be talking about spyro
i dont know
no lol
no
This place is fun, you're just too emu to have fun D:
No
we don't talk about Spyro in here
Spyro is stupid
I hate him
start debating, ill listen
This is for the members of Spyroforum
Not for talking about Spyro
we talk about normal stuff
Normally
say something that aggravates most of the people
I'm not starting anything
we don't always debate
...
I have nothing worth debating
what about
If you're just a troll I'll ask you to leave.
troll?
and these guys are my friends I don't feel like fighting with them over something that doesn't matter
whats that
Someone who only comes to sites/places just to anger/annoy people.
someone who intentionally gets fights going through rude comments or provoking
stop being a communist
We don't like trolls.
;)
yeah he was a good one lol
OK this guy's a troll
Communist?
wow lol
i cant write things without being accused of being a troll
I should go beat myself for being a communist :D
thats communism
Shoo shoo
Go away little troll
*gets_broom*
SHOO!
im not a troll
lol
GO ON!
/me watches
/me waves broom
shut up youre making me leave
>:|
SHOO!
tsk tsk
/me facepalms
ur like over boring
Please don't feed the troll while it leaves!
*SHOO*
then get the hell off if you don't want to be here
nobody is making you
Exactly.
Troll.
do you like accuse everyone of being a troll?
No.
You're acting like one though.
trying to start arguments is trolling
dude i just came here to chat and im getting bashed in the moment i speak
"Trying to start arguments is trolling" YES
SHOO
gtgbbl
ok if i disagree with someone im an instant troll?
i dont even know where you invented that word
you can disagree with someone just fine. When you intentionally try to start arguments with someone or between people that's considered trolling
that's just one of the rules
don't talk to me about it talk to a mod
too much effort
arghh
for such a tiny thing
and if you're going to do it at least do it when about 25 members are on so they really don't notice lol
so im allowed to call people "trolls" when they start an argument?
that comment right their is why you are being a troll
is "troll" even a correct word?
if you want to start a debate with someone then just ask "Anyone care to debate?" there is nothing wrong with saying that
no that sounds gay
when you went over the line was with the communist
most of us don't care
she'll boot you
so power abuse?
ill stay here just to see if something happens
well you're not on Mibbit so I can't pm you
why would i like to read your pms
does it have something important?
because I would warn you about certain things ahead of time before you do them if you were on here
?
i dont care that much
im sure ill behave
but the vast majority of the time we don't talk about Spyro
i know
Mods can kick/ban for whatever reason they feel kick/ban worthy.
well that sucks
No, that's life.
Get over it.
lol...meet Dari....
ok what if you would see someone with a gun and he shot you?
That's still life.
You don't have time to get over it though.
well gl with that attitude
(Well depends where you get shot)
oi
can i come to your house and see what youd say?
youre trying to be an emo
Nope.
yepa
Nope.
Dari is not emo at all
far from it
well maybe you all are emos and im not
is that so?
probably then yes
wow guys we're all Emos didn't ya know lol
I think I'm gonna go cut myself now
Life is unfair.
Deal with it.
i never said it would be unfair
i asked your opinion
You mean wouldn't.
i never said anything about what i think
were talking what you would say
youre just trying to be a cool emo, "aaargh... life is unfairrr...." *slits wrists*
Well you said "Good luck with that attitude" What attitude? A realistic attitude? I think that's the best kind.
it is
Well im very certain that you would cry your eyes out when someone threatened to kill you with a gun
ignoring reality gets you nowhwere
Nope.
I can't change the fact the someone is going to kill me
So why cry about it?
prove that
you would try every way to avoid the fact that he kills you
give me gun and flight tickets
I would try to avoid it, but crying wouldn't help.
hm
I would cry if someone in my family got shot and died.
youll still need to provide me with a gun and flight tickets
i can pull the trigger if it helps
No, if you want proof, you provide the equipment.
Why should I have to pay for something you want?
nope
you will be happy because you proved that i was wrong
so you give me the gun and tickets
lmao
ill still have to travel there and pull the trigger
thats like so much effort
No, if you want proof, I will give it, but you have to get the stuff yourself, as you want the proof.
I don't care one way or another if you have proof.
sir, i disagree
well i do
So you provide it the stuff, thank you for proving my point.
itd be hard to laugh with a bullet in your head
Yes, it would.
so you buy the gun and tickets
many will never know what it's like to have a freaking gun pointed at you. But if you accept life for what it is then it really will not matter
its a small price for being right
There is no price for being right.
Being right is free.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Do you expect someone to buy something that you want?
No its not
Answer my question, yes, or no.
You wanted to be right
Answer my question, yes, or no.
Yes i do
When you benefit too
I don't benefit.
Youre right after all then
Yes you do
No I don't.
You get the change to feel the bullet in your brain
and a change to prove youre right
I don't want a chance to prove I'm right.
You want proof that I'm right.
Therefore, you can pay to find out if I am right or not.
Your logic is flawed.
Well then you fail
ahh
the classic fail lol
What a great response.
I think you win Dari lol
I couldnt think of anything better
But wait
yup you win
uhh
Dari always wins against mindless kids like this guy
You expect someone to pay for something that YOU want. That's like saying to someone on the street "You see that flat screen TV? Buy it for me"
u all stink
You can't smell me.
ouch
my pride
*cough*
You just won the worst debate of all time award.
*cough*
lmfao
idk Dari we have had some pretty screwed up ones on here lol
DAWI
you suck!!!!!!!11111111
I suppose.
lol
but that was pretty entertaining
But still, it is pretty hard to find someone THAT stupid.
What do I suck? Eggs?
not always lol
I suck lemons.
Mysterious Cynder? lol
I like lemons.
i can smell you
Yeah, but most people aren't this bad.
I'm afraid that's you, not me.
eh true
i have a super smelling machine
Nah.
yeh
wow
Nah.
yeh
Nah.
/me hits head against wall.
What an idiot.
is you
Nah.
How old are you?
Yeh.
Nah.
5?
Yeh.
Prolly.
lol
I bet he comes back and says "POWER ABUSE!"
who fucking cares
Which was the start of this argument.
his idiocy is reason enough to boot him
Yes. I agree. ^
the moron will go on the forum and say all sorts of stupid things now lol
/me thinks that there should be an IQ requirement to join the forum.
i was just about to say that....
Haha.
Great minds think alike? :P
re like the chat
*More
perhaps :)
because the forum is for Spyro
a kid's game

norc= tit.:D
Good for you
That's not irony though =/
Heh
I suggest you search google for the definition of irony.
(Yes, I know he's gone)
To be honest though, after you defeat Gnasty Gnorc the dragon sounds like he's saying "In there is Gnasty's treasure [censored]"
...
.___.
You got censored.
Lol.
I think we can probably guess what it said :P
That's kind of a pointless thing to censor though
Yes, but I'm going to laugh anyway.

Mage: Because, you're a Glaciomancer, and the temperature is simply responding to your presence.
I want to go back to Chicago now :(
I thought he was a spleen mage?
For the record, you guys aren't allowed to play with modes.
Dari: I just wanted to say Glaciomancer
Ok. Lol.
Mage sets mod: +PoOp
mode*
bah whatever it was dumb anyway
How do you log mode changes? O_o
Hm

Hello

Don;t play with modes.
Finally.

I didn't know I wasn't supposed to

OwO
Owo

Fine, am I allowed to do this?
Sure.

She just realised she can't put them back
I'm pretty sure she knew that already
No
she does
I can get it back
But clearly I don't need or deserve to have it anymore
If I ever did...
=/
So anyway....
I see dead peopl
Uh,what just happened?
BEANZ
Did I get kicked or something?
No, both accounts are still here
not that I see
Bah
Ghost.

Thanks
Kick wont help, you need to Ghost.
/ns ghost ghostname yourpassword
Hmm
I'mma test that.
Doesn't work
Funfun...XD
Whatever
It does work.
if it was still on.
That's what I did
Oh
=P
then that means your ghost isnt online so you dont need to.
Haha.
hah
Good thing I figured out how to change my password without Things
=P
What, do you drop the nick and reregister it?
No
There's a command
Oh.
I found it on google :P
lol
He speaks!
:P
O_O
:P
=/ does the same thing
Shorter is always better.
Dari: Try and say that to all the girls who are disappointed with you, they won't agree, I'm sure.
np
*grins and runs*
hahahaha
I disagree, they've never been disappointed.
you wouldn't know :P
(Well it is, but you don't know that)
Lol
lmfao
lol dude
ur not supposed to ADMIT it
I don't really care.
It's the internet.
FAVOURITISM
:P
oh by the way
Favoritism?
=/
you are now world famous for admitting to being a shriveldick
I didn't admit that.
Lawl.
You cannot admit what isn't true.
Therefore your logic is flawed.
Therefore your logic is flawed.
oi
you did!
and it's now on bash.org.
Nope.
I was talking to Red.
it was a joke man relax
I could care less
that just*
owo
hm
Ok?
Lol, SR deleted my topic.
/me reposts.
I wouldn't do that
I would.
hm
What rules are there for spam anyway?
The rules are if you do somethign again after I delete it, I ban you.
Hmmm
So if I edit it, I don't get a ban?
I think that's about enough with the stories involving me and SR
If you try to tip-toe around stuff I say, you get a ban.
It's really annoying
So what is wrong with it that gets me a ban?
because he obviously doesn't want you doing it
I didn't like it, and didn't find it funny.
Because you're implying crap that isn't true
Dari: The fact you said he got a twelve year old pregnant maybe?
I'm not implying anything.
I'm posting spam, as the name suggests.
So if I delete the bits you don't like, can I repost it?
You would be making a blank post then.
...
I'm sorry guys
I'm in a bad mood right now
So if I post a screenshot of it, I'm not actually reposting it, I'm just posting a picture.
I'll shut up now
Meh, everyone has bad moods.
:(
hm
Hmm
I know very well what your doing, and if I don't like it it will be deleted.
Just give it up dari
Heheheh.
It's not funny :(
I find SR's responses funny.
oi
I don't find any of your posts funny.
Most, if not all are not meant to be.
So what is your point?
Thats pure bullshit, everyone here knows your trying to be funny.
Stop arguing with me.
No, the story I posted was because I was bored, it did not have an element of humor in it, I wanted something to do, remembered thinking that up, so posted it.
So I should just agree with what is wrong?
Pffr.
Pfft.*
Lol, you have a ROUTINE? XD
Back later.
Ok
Don't care much. He just proves I am right.

7Damned Gerple and Spyro master talked it out of it ><
7Dari: Weapons? Give me a minute.
Ok.
7By stats you mean damage right?
hm
Damage specials, class, if it is a starter weapon, if not how much it costs, level requirements etc.
7Don't forget the cutlass, same damage range as shinobi, pirate starter, with a special cost of 51 that does 2x damage and is canon attack or something

wheren't u banned?
Dunno, tried to join and found myself unbanned, if it was a mistake, I'll get banned again.
7The bans got wiped.
Lol.
They're all on there.
I checked.
Hm.
7The bans got wiped a while ago.
Well the point is that all other bans are on there, I'm not, whether it is an accident or not I'm sure we'll find out soon.
4You will get banned again
Ok, lol.
;\
4the bans all went down after the server reset
We'll see though, I checked, all bans are on the list.
4not on my list
7I really should be writing this script for English, but I'm not on just blame it on Jack. :P

ROAAAAAAAAR
Was unbanned eariler.
Then RDX banned me. XD
7Oh, I forgot how much it takes off.
yeah I know
How much what does?
I still think SR could have unbanned me he wanted to

All the other bans were still on the list.
7Falcon spear: 50g, sp -35, regeneration of 5 rounds.
7Oh, and level 4.
Ok.
7Eagle blade: 75g, sp -51, regeneration of 7 rounds, level 6.

If SR cares he'll just reban you
You didn't even really do anything
Yeah, I'm not going in though, it'd make worse, if it can be worse.
lol
Good choice
Because even though it's not really ban evading, as there is no ban, I don't think it's a good idea. XD

I guess SR doesn't like it when people disagree with him. XD

You never learned that before?

Although that removes cookies for all sites.

What are they anyways
They save information for the websites, such as what you typed in their search boxes, whether your password autofills or not, etc.
ah
Last full day of school tomorrow.
hmm
cool.
that thing that always pops down with usernames whenever I type something in bugs me
How do I get rid of those

if I click "A" it'll have emails, usernames, etc
listed below
You could not accept cookies.
Wait
is that what cookies are
Cookies do stuff like that, and other things.
I'm just asking how do I get rid of that stuff
Block cookies.
Or make all cookies delete when you shut down the browser
How do I delete them is what I'm asking!?

I already told you how to clear cookies.
Yeah, and it didn't work

4I don't think it works with Mibbit
With*
Oh.
Meh.
Mibbit fails.
mIRC > Mibbit.
10my brain is gonna explode
3It works
4Mibbit is simple
Anything really, I'm a quick learner. =)
lol
and well...
Don't like IceChat.
10whats mIRC?
irssi > all
4They are all IRC clients
4you can use them to connect to the IRC servers
10ah
Mibbit is a client, it's just basic.
4for instance
Well....I haven't actually used irssi myself
4I'm using Mibbit
4Dari is using mIRC
:)
but It's apparently the best for Coding
yah
At the moment atleast
4anyone with a green shirt is mibbit
10and blue?
IRC Coding is always simple. :P
4other clients
I'm trying to just gather all the knowledge I can about networks, how they work, how to manage them, and the like.
4Everything but Mibbit
Unless you're doing a complicated socket script
10...
dar: I mean with like, perl or C++ codes
*dari
10how old is everyone here
17 lol
4 20
I like mIRC script, really simple.
3 17
It incredibly simple
.ics and .ice style is pretty simple too
10ok, im ok with not knowing what you're all talking about then if you're around the same age as me lol
13
14*
4Fresh: SR is only 15 an knows more then just about everyone
but it's somewhat impractical to learn, considering that you can't use it anywhere else
10....ok, im not ok with THAT
4it takes years to learn most of this stuff depending on how quick you learn
Making a google search script with mIRC script it still complicated though.
lol
Yeah
4for example
4 6 months ago I didn't know any of this shit
But still, you have to admit that having an IRC client that accepts C++ and Perl as scripting types is a pretty good idea
One of my flash files has over 1000 lines of code though, lol.
Yeah.
Although you can make your own client.
True
10ok, in 2 months im gonna start learning, I dont like this feeling of ineptitude
With php it's pretty simple,.
4php is easy
Lol indeed
4hence the popularity
10and php is?
good attitude FB
I do. :P
xD
4I'm not as experienced as you are Dari lol
:P
4hence why I'm going back to school for it :P
13omg I just learned quite a bit about that masking stuff!!!!
4so in two years I'll know more then YOU
mhm
13EEEE!!!
Many people are starting to use php to make websites.
4php is good
13like phpbb?
4because it works well with MySQL
phpbb isn't php.
4it's fast and cheap
10ok, im going to bed before my head starts hurting even more
4php is the communication
10night
/me nods
php is a scripting language.
4between the database and the site
13eh
4a very effective language
13I made a free website a long time ago from a place called phpbbnow
4oh damn we scared him off
13it's the same kind of layout that Spyroforum's got
4phpbb is not the same
4that's the forum support
13oh
4php is something different
phpbb is sort of like the bones for a forum, made in pbp, I think.
4it's the actual language
php*
Never used phpbb, so not 100% sure.
4very popular with sites
4mainly because of how well it works with MySQL
I'm thinking of maybe learning some XHTML as well >.>
4Go for it
4I've been learning slowly
What's the difference between HTML, and XHTML?
Uses, etc?
Eh, not completely sure
4XHTML is basically shortcuts
XHTML is supposedly
Lol.
4a modified version
*better
Ok.
4that is better and easier
lol I thought so
I get so confused with all the different versions of languages.
Lol
4Well with sites it's pretty simple
I get confused between C# C+ C++ and C particularly.
I did a research paper on programming languages
4just HTML, XHTML and CSS
and I was like @_@
4C++ is a bitch
I like VB, simple, and so many uses.
Brb.
4have not tried it
Back.
What are the most useful languages?
4Yeah I'm pretty sure that's the junk you confused me with when I first came here lol
4I don't know what the most usefull is
4"useful"
Well, this is a good place to learn that sort of stuff
4either way a computer is stupid unless you give it direction
especially with me and ari here
Sweet :D
he's good with the servers and i can go into the source code of a server and tear it up >D
I downloaded WAMP.
4C++ is mostly used in the software end of things
xD Nice indeed
and maybe add a few functions while i'm at it
4http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/BjarneStroustrup.jpg
4but if this guy can do it
Pichu: I don't think you can tear up InspIRCd any more than it is :P
4anyone can
LOL
XDDD
4creator of C++
fine
Wow.
i can put it together
He doesn't look capable of doing such a thing.
That's like saying you'll tear up a pile of wood shavings
4does Bill Gates look capable of what he did?
if he wants to let him try lol
Point taken.
4I read an interesting article about him
Someone told me Bill Gates used Linux to make Windows.
4well I don't know that
hehe
xD
4but he got into computers when someone at the local computer institute challenged a team of students to hack into their compute
4"comptuer
4or find a way to hack into their new computer system
LOL
Exactly, people should pay me to hack them.
4He would work on it for hours and then sneak out after bed and break into the institute to break into it
4he kept going until he finally got in
oh, i'll try. but that depends on your definition of "tear up"
Looooooooooool. Wow.
4but yeah man
4computers are dumb
4we have to tell them what to do :P
Pichu: Do you know Perl?
yep
How good are you with Perl?
Hehe.
very.
4that's what makes it fun
4the challenge
Could you look over my script?
Well they have a rat brain controlling a robot somewhere in Japan
4at least to me
It's lagging and I don't know how to fix it
I think it's Japan.
sure
4yeah but that's the freaking Japanese
4:P
Lol.
Again, good point.
no guarantees though
4they are the most brilliant people in the world and yet vent it in the must idiotic ways
Lol.
E-mail?
4seriously
4you ever seen MXC?
xD
What does it stand for?
MOST EXTREME ELIMINATION CHALLENGE!
4what he said
O_o
4Seriously
No.
4Japanese are freaking brilliant
4yet idiots
Sent
13LOL
13agreed
So yeah, anywhere you want me to help in, I'd be glad to xD
I like the talking toilets.
You good with any programming?
13seen what
13I just checked this tab and read that
13XD
4MXC
Pichu: The loop
13no
When there's a lot of users on it
I'm getting more fluent with C++ at the moment, still working on it
4Wathc
4Watch
4^^^^^
Will do. :)
that seems to be going around :P
what can I say
:)
Looks like Takeshi's castle.
while (1) {
Wait, it is.
right?
/me nods
4it is
Ah. :)
He ran into the wall
LOL
4:p
Do forever
Reminds me of Wipeout USA.
4Because that's where Wipeout got the idea
Lol.
Pichu: I also got a program called "ircd-benchmark.pl" which puts a bunch of drones on the IRCd
They'll eventually ping out though, since <STDIN> blocks
"And he takes a full load from Herby, he doesn't know whether to scream, or smile"
LOL
gah
why do you use STDIN?
4lmao
4I love that show
For command-line input
That's just for the test script thing
Probably not the best setup
Stepping stones one = win
4haha
But I just wanted the bench mark to work, I didn't really care about how well it worked
ah
not sure how much I can do about this lag problem
3:48 LOLOLOLOL
I don't think Perl is the best language to write an IRCd in
I wanted to try though
4I'LL WINN!!!!
I don't think C++ would be that effective with it either
i beg to differ
Hm, I think I overheard someone talking about doing that the other day
Does it?
I've heard it doesn't work well
with C++ you can have multiple threads to handle input and output
higher CPU load probably, but not that much]
and faster
Well then whoever it was must have been pissed at C++
You have multiple threads in Perl, but I can't get the implementation to work :(
Hrm
4I think so
4let me see anyways
threads in C++ are simple
only thing i need to know
http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/9502/avatar4.swf
is connections with C++
Like, sockets?
yeah
hmmm
if know that, i could potentially make a server
4It says to log in lol
Pichu: You have sockets, which are connectors to other places
Just put in anything as username
And click logi n
log in*
yeah, i understand sockets
I need to get on learning socket connections in a few things lol
what i dont understand is how to make the sockets in C++
you know
4doesn't do anything damn it lol
Oo
Refresh it
Works for me, and other people :p
:o*
I'll make it good when I can be bothered. :P

Anything can be done
Server side extensions could even prepare you a coffee, all you need is the coffee machine attached via USB, a driver and a set of Java API that you can use in your server code
I want to do that.
Eh....bored

It is possible to put software on someone's computer, which allows you to watch through their webcam.
I think.
10I always feel like, somebody's watching meeeeeee
3uh
/me 2dances
10mj ftw
2innit.
7Someone saw a 'ghost' through a live webcam.
Although that means either having access to their computer, or getting them to download it.
3What is the estimate of a youtube video uplaod three minutes?
2 hours.
Or longer.

3omg!
2Season 8...........win!
7We got season 8 here?
2Lol, when JD mentioned SARs.
2Er, I don't know
7The ending was annoying and inconclusive.
3yay!
7And JD's not even going to be IN season 9 for more than six episodes.
10O:
7And Carla's only going to be a GUEST star. How the fuck will that work?
3http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQLN5EqL7c my first ever video! woo hoo
10the show's screwed
7Yeah.
2...FAIL
7Turk and Dr. Cox are in it though, which is something. But the whole thing that made Dr Cox awesome was his JD interactions.
2They should DEFNITELY make more Jackass
3lol
2I love Turk.
3actually you just wrote it out for him to see
10link's face is wierd in twilight princess

13nope

3wtf
13Lol
3wait so i DON'T need a converter to post videos on youtube

2I think I silenced Mike into... silence
3 100 percent score?
2With my weird comment. <.>
2English tests = epic fail for me
3History test kills me
2I have got a physics exam on friday and then I'm free-ish
2Free from exams at the least.
2Not free from coursework though...:(
If grades and years are the same, she's in 9, I think.
k
2Yeah, I'm in year 9
2Everyone in my year was ready to put their knowledge to use! D:
I liked my old Chemistry teacher, he was funny, and he gave you tests before the end of year test, what he didn't realise was that he gave us the end of year exam.
Also, he once gave us the end of year test mark scheme.
"I give you afterschool detention, come back at lunch time!"
Good old Aki B.
13One of my old favorite teachers was my 4th grade one and he would talk about his life as a kid half the time other than teaching us the same old boring crap we already knew
13and we told him that we hated our music teacher so he purposely got us to music class late
2Win!
13he was awrdomr
My whole class skipped music.
13*awesome
13LOL
2I like music, it's winful
We got afterschool detentions, worth it though.
We sat down and watched the cricket.
The music teacher could probably see where we were, but didn't bother to go and get us, he hates us, so he was probably thankful we weren't going to turn up.
13I like music when it teaches you something, not when he thinks that beating on his stomache is making music and/or teaching us about how verses work. -___-
2As a 'punishment'.
NO U! >:U
That will be all
2Ok.
2"Free Gay Chat Maleforce has evolved, Check it out Upto 200 mins Free when you join! " these ads are annoyiiiiiiiing.
The sixth formers did loads of crap on their last day, can't remember if I told you guys or not. (last day meaning last day before all their exams)
JH: I don't want an Apple. They're too heavy.
APPLE: We have some light ones too, like an iBook.
JH: I heard that iBooks can only be used in Starbucks.
LOL
13LOL
xD
2On the sixth formers last day last year, they put polish on the toilet seats, itching powder in the toilet roll, set off the fire alarms, brought in those honk can things and that silly string stuff and made a right mess XD
okay, I'm gonna be heading off
bbl
2Everyone was scared to venture into the bathrooms o.O
2See ya
13My cousin told me something short but funny on Monday
2Go!
13He said that in his middle school the other day one of his teachers thats like 70 years old took some kid's hat and threw it down the hall screaming "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!"
13Note: Becoming a teacher is the worst ride of your life
13:P
2XD
2I'm a really bad teacher
2If someone gets stuck in ICT they don't ask me for help cos I don't show them how to do it properly
13If no one understood what I said I'd get pissed and throw a chair
2And it would help if I could find my memory stick.
2Awwies.
2I'm not that popular but everyone in my (rather slow) ict class thinks I can understand computers really rather well
2...
4Liek hai
Hey.
4nah
4got boring again
7...
10I should be working on my 4th c++ lesson.
10I think I did it in the wrong order, cause I never went over the If-Then-Else statements
2Whats c++?
10A programming language
4C++ be a nice complicated language that is helpful for computer based functions and programming video games and such
2Ah
2More complicated than Welsh?
4nah lol
10It's for program scripting
4It's not that complicated if you're use to it
10Game scripting is like the Lua language
4It's also good for math based functions
10Yup
4which I stay away from
4since math sucks
Most languages have mathematical functions build in though.
/me 2is going to keep out of this, lololol
Oo
10I concur
4Most do but math isn't everything
4Yeah it's not mine either
4Actually I suck at math
2Ehh, I'm not that good at maths
10It's the bane of my existance
4I'll just have my sister do all the work when I take Calculus haha
10Dumb pythagorean theorems that I'll never need later on
10in life
I love maths. :P
4You won't need any of it in real life unless it involves your profession
2Do you honestly think someone who plays guitar for a living / is a surgeon / is a professional hobo would need standard form that much?

Jump on SM's shoulders or something.
14o.o
6eh?? why me
I had a good comment but it would only apply to a male.
14o.o
6or daris so we can see this comment
14EW!
7If she wants to keep her lower body, she won't.
14NO!
6lol
6XD
7Abbey, check your fucking PM tab.
14I don't know where he's been.
We don't know where you've been.
14<.<
Abbey: Perhaps you should swallow a sword.
6XD
Better yet, an umbrella, so it will expand in your esophagus.
6that would be funny to see
14Master...
6her neck expanding when u open teh umbrella
7Gaiz, isn't abbey being rediculously possessive of C7??
I saw that on 1, 000 Ways To Die
14NO!
7double question mark accidental.
Some idiot agreed to swallow an umbrella.
6i dunno
A corner?
Dari should respond soon.
7A corner.
/me 14backs away from the crowd
?
"How many times msut I tell you, there are no corners here."
*must
Lol.
Oh no.
/me 6pushes abbey into teh crowd
7Abbey, give me a reasonable response as to WHY /exactly/ you're not being possessive of C7?
The souls are awake.
Mucking.
6it dosent mean anything lol
Lol.
7Her responses suggest otherwise.
Sorry, but that made me lawl.
/me shuts it.
7"NO!" "I'm NOT being possessive!" "I'M NOT!".
14If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch and practically start a fight every 2 seconds. :P
/me isn't exactly sure what to shut, so shuts verything just be safe.
*everything
7I'm not, it's just fun annoying her.
Being possesive doesn't have to be that extreme, Abbey.
You can eb possesive just by not wanting her to leave.
*be
7"If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
LOL
6right....
7It's like poking a sleeping bear, except the bear's all roar and no paw.
7claw*
Paw works too.
7Hah.
Hahaha.
7She couldn't handle the truth.
Or the button.
/me 6face palms
7... the truth. she couldn't handle the truth.
No, the button too.
6you really get an edge dont you from doing that to people?
7Just her, and people I dislike.
6theres no point its people youve never met before and all they are trying to do is talk to people
I doubt she left because of what Kj was saying lol.
7It's no fun doing it to /sensible/ people, like you.
*KJ
6well if you dilike them keep it to urself
14X.X
7To repeat my earlier point,
6no back off
7"If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
14Lol.
7People like you are what's wrong with the world. You believe everything should be sugarcoated, and that the truth is being mean.
6truth is not always mean
6ive had to deliver it on occasions
6ur just taking abbeys mucking about on here and turning it into something else
There's that muck again.
14-.-
14Here we go, starting up another argument.
6in this case it is
It's beautiful.
6your just turning something stupid into a non existing truth
7I didn't actually mean it until I saw her responces: a random bluff.
6well what else is she meant to think if your stirring up bullshit?
14Random bluff?
7And Abbey, SF is the one who took offence to me having a discussion with you about your interactions with C7.
14Lol.
SM you mean?
7I actually said it in PM first but her randomly violent denials made me put it here.
6i wa sbaout to say lol
7Yes, I mean SM.
6are we done now ?
6lol
No, keep goign, I was about to grab popcorn.
*going
6lol
7WE are, but abbey never actually responded to my last comment.
7Of course he isn't.
14And, I know he did.
6i dont blame her, its her choice whether or not she can talk to you
Oh. crap. 'Cause you know how I'm always trying to help.
7Right, Abbey. Remember, silence is just another form of confirmation: "If I was being possessive then I would keep her all to myself for no-one to touch" You're trying to. "start a fight every 2 seconds. :P" You try to, and C7's not on as much anymore.
7I'll be perfectly able to back down, if she gives me real reasons. Most of my 'arguments' evolve from people being inable to do that.
14Master is defending me, a thing you obviously don't like.
^ That was random
7Yeah well people won't always be around to defend you. You claim you're 13: enough to hold your own in a discussion with one of your peers.
7Not just something. Many things, many instances, many actions.
7Abbey: We all know what?
7You need to finish your comments.
14Oh come on. -.-
*are on
7... I highly doubt you have anything to follow that up.
14C7 told us all a little something if you catch my drift.
7SM: I know that. Her responces are what made me interested.
13WOO
6cause tehy are justing joking about, but apoarently you cant see that at the moment
13 42
13bwahah
7Abbey: Yeah, I highly doubt you have something to follow that up.
14We all know about your /connection/
12I don't.
13Everyone: Who wants to suffer from a video?
7Are you gunna continue time-wasting, or have you actually thought of anything?
A video can't make me suffer.
14Except Icy.
12Me.
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW58S1FNFts BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA
12Oh my god.
14Dude, I'm talking about you like C7 to a degree that makes me wanna mess around xP.
13>=D
13DAMN
13bwahaha?
It works.
13MUWAHAHAHA
Wth?
Ahhh!!!
13:P
/me curls up into foetal position.

7SM: I was watching that stupid fly 'breaking news' story.
14Excuse.
Dead.
6lol right
7Not really.
/me 12shoots the bunny repeatedly.
13shoot it's carrot
13XDDDDD
7Abbey: Yeah. You know how C7 exaggerates.
Hush.
7what in god's name is wrong with that bunny?
14It's not an exaggeration. You just <3 her, am I right?
12It's retarted.
13It wants to snuggle a vegetable
13I know
13It's evil
13(:
7Abbey: No, you're not right.
Wow, is it just me, or does that thing have 2 meanings?
Probably just my dirty mind.
7Dari: Hahaha.
7I was thinking the same thing.
14Oh really then?
7What gender is that rabbit? XD
13God knows what
Well, I'm guessing female.
13Probably both
13SHIT
7Who in god's name makes this shit?
13I'm missing dwaggy tales
14Typical.
7Abbey: Was that a rhetorical question?
Woo, I've finally found a program that allows you to steal other people's wifi.
7Not very imaginative. Same clips used repeatedly.
14Yes.
7.... I just realised. Half of it's in german.
14But dA is when I noticed.
Dari: My dad's been doing that, lol.
The German is "I love you", I think.
So imaginative.
7Indeed.
It's legal too. :)
Teehee.
7Going to be typing up this bossfight, if you need me set off the name tag.
The program even works for your Iphone.
Awesome.

14True
6all they need to do is set a password or something, meh never mind lol
God, 6 pages on oil.
14Yeah.
I'm going to keep putting that off.
14Some idiots don't secure it.
Mine is secure, crackable, but secure.
14Lol.
WEP is can be cracked without too much hassle, but most people are too stupid to be able to, and I need WEP for my DS to connect to it, it doesn't support more secure ones such as WPA
6hmm im tempted lol
Wii does though.
You don't live that close to me, SM. :P
6PSP uses WEP to, but my dad wont give me teh bloody wi-fi password
14o:
6Dari: i know
Just reset the router, lol
Resets the WEP.
14LOL
14True.
Well, resets all passwords.
And settings.
6hmm and at the risk of an angry irish amn... NO
To factory default.
6*man
Angry Irish man. Oo Scarey.
14Yeah.
13back
14My router has the password on it.
14And i doubt my parents could change it.
6lol he is Dari XD
Lol.
6my dad could change it, thats the problem
6otherwise i would
How would he know that you'd reset it, anyway?
14Yeah.
6because im always trying to find out the bloody password for it, as well as working out the password for his account on teh laptop
6the DOS thingy on the start up ive forgotten how to do, but oh well
14lol
DoS?
Denial of Service!

Damn essays.
It shouldn't be compulsory.
6nto as bad as a 2 hour exam dari
14We call it R.E
14._.
6you can get out of it dari
Ours was multi-choice.
6if
14Lol
You can't.
6you get ur parents to write a note saying you dont want to do it or something taht can get u out of it
Damn government made it so.
6well you could at my school
14o.0
Not are ours.
at*
Size 22 font. :)
6well at my school you could, i just didnt follow up the option to do so
6good idea :D
14o.o
6whats it on anyway ?
6in RE?
What, the essay?
6yeh
Why churches should focus on their similarities rather than their differences.
Some crap about God wanting his followers to get on.
That's what I'll write.
And make it take up a lot more room.
14o.o
6oh so religon and equality then
Hmm, maybe I could mention Israel, and Jerusalem, as an example of what can be the result of God's followers not getting along.
6if your controversial towards religon you get good marls for it
Our teacher is evil though.
6how do u mean?
Just because the test was multi-choice, he wouldn't make it easy.
All the answers were right, just one more right than others.
So out of A, B, C, D, all of them were right.
But one of the would be more right than the others.
6oh i get it
I'm BACK BITCHES
6extra points
/me is not a bitch.
/me is a bastard.

Lol, on the porch.
LOL
Look up Norman Rockwell is Bleeding
13I saw this video on funniest home videos that was kind of mean
13some little kid got a 50 dollar gift thing from his grandpa and he says "50 DOLLARS!? And I thought you were a cheapskate!"
13Then the grandpa was sad
Wow
13I felt bad for him

13back...
13I'm stuffed like a big fat turkey
Lol.
13but they have some chick that can't speak english and she screwed up our orders AND gave us the wrong amount of change back
13She forgot to charge us the second time too
13They made my dad's burger without the avocado or whatever but he says it was still good
13eh
so all in all a good day?
/me drives over RDX's 'rig' in a monster truck.
Pepsi's better.
4You wish
I have no need to wish, I have reality. :)
10lol
4in which Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi in all markets by over 30%
4well most markets
Lol.
What I find strange is that Pepsi is owned by Coca-Cola.
10Just because the majority of the people prefer coke doesnt make it better :P
4Where did you see that
On the top of a pepsi bottle.
4then it was prolly someone just fucking around and put a coke cap on a pepsi bottle lol
"A product of the Coca-Cola factory", or something.
4yeah
4no
10lol you are gulliable arent you, Dari
4Pepsi would sooner blow themselves up then be owned by Coke
Oo
Yes, because I expect people over 18 to be mature. :P
4psst
4the older the get the less mature you get
10Its all a matter of principle now lol I dont think Pepsi would sell to Coke even if they were going bankrupt considering the history between them
Lol? Oo
10and RDX is right, I mean, just look at him
4Depends on how desperate they are to stay in business
4but Pepsi wouldn't go bankrupt lol
Well Dr Pepper is owned by coke, right?
4No
4in Global Markets yes
DAMN TESCO WORKERS!
Oh, ok.
10does snapple sell apple products?
How about lucazode?
4Ice Tea

Fanta?
10Fanta's owned by coke
Sprite?
10Coke
The coke adverts are all really annoying.
4Fanta is coke
4Sprite is coke
10lol try reading the labels of what you're drinking and you'll learn :P
10we've already resolved that
4I know I just like saying it again
I could swear the the pepsi bottle said it was made by coca-cola...
4it was prolly someone screwing around
4Pepsi is not owned by Coke trust me lol
10because you're a coke man, and repetitiveness is the key to profit :P#
10Its owned by ASDA
Does Schwepps (sp?) own Cadbury?

14xD
6whats so flash about this avvie then?
It's made in Flash.
:P
4I really don't care what your avie is so long as it doesn't make some poor sap's computer crash
/me 6is getting annoyed with his connection
4or if it is a little to mature of course but you shouldn't be doing that :P
Although, .swf extensions are blocked for avvies.
:P
So I can't.
14o.o
14Master
14Sue your ISP.
14:D
4oh wel
Hm, or you could allow them. :P
bbl
6stupid connection...
14Lawl
6why lol
4The one about the freaking vegans vs. meat vs. WHO GIVES A FUCK?
4yes Dari
13yep taht one
4I already warned them once
4I think
13Well, they're still going on about it
14o.o
14Meat Fight?
14WTF
13They're fighting about what's good/bad about eating certain things n shit
647.4% bigger.
14That's pathetic. Seriously.
You can't ignore that.
:P
13let people eat what they want and get the hell over it
14Yeah.
4Warn them one more time
4if they keep going at it lock it
13I personally don't see the point in not eating me
13OK
14Lol Master
14aw
Where's this topic?
Ok.
Where's the meat topic?
14LOL
13Any more posts on the "debate" will have the topic locked.
14They made a topic......on general stuff.......and it turned into a debate? WTF is wrong with people these days?
13:P
Are you saying dogs you learn their names and commands are just "instinct"? Dogs do not hear the sound as we do, they just recognise after MANY repeted times, that when a certain sound is made, they do something, and they get a treat.
That's not clever.
Any animal can do that.
13I'd kill a baby if there were no such things as hamburgers
14There goes his connection.
13JK
14O_O
14I was about to say ._.
13:P
13I'm glad that I wasn't born into a vegitarian/vegan family
13It's funny how a lot of them say that they don't want to eat anything living, yet they're eating fruits and vegetables
LOL
HAHAHAHA
14LOL
14xD
13If they didn't want to eat anything living they'd starve to death
13They're liars.
14Indeed.
Plants have feelings too. :(
13Yep :P
14And what about Yogurt?
14XP
13And I think that there's male and female plants
13Idk though
Yoghurt comes from cows.
Well.
Milk, which is usually from cows.
13perhaps goats
13:P
And vegans don't drink milk.
14Dam
14Was about to say that.
14Lol.
13Then there's the people that are so crazy that they won't wear anything made from wool and stuff
14Vegans don't eat cheese either.
13which is just stupid
14Lol.
13it doesn't hurt the animal
I suppose at the moment we have GM products, in time, we will have completely artificial food.
14They animal is already dead.
14Last time I checked, no-one can turn time.
14I know.
14But when it's like bear-skin etc.
13ah
14-.-
13I remember on an episode of trading spouses this lady almost made the vegan family eat gumbo
14Indeed.
...Gumbo?
13at the last minute she made it vegitarian
WTh is that?
14o.o
Oh.
14O_O
Im going to buy more fur clothing.
14LOL
13hahaha
Hehehe.
Need to keep the demand up.
14xD
14Majority of clothes sold are made artificially anyway.
I want purple tomatos.
tomatoes*
13XD
They made them by mixing snapdragon plants and tomatoes.
They're GM tomatoes.
13But the freaking squirrels are starting to pull up our crops
Although apparently we won't get them for a few years.
They were supposed to be really good, although later people will probably say they give you cancer, and then they'll say they're good for you again later.
14Lolz.
14LOL
/me 14roflz
Everything is said to cause cancer at one point. Like when they said oranges gave you cancer.
13we have some good strawberries this year
Probably anything can give you cancer.
13they never grew that well the past couple years
Because mutation of the cells can be caused by a huge number of things.
13DIET PEPSI GIVES U CANCER
Lol.
Aspatain is supposed to be bad.
Found in almost all chewing gum.
14Dari.
Yes?
Lol, I remember when you could get rain flavoured chewing gum.
14Cancer is caused by everything. Soon our air and sun will cause cancer :D
14xP
Sun already does cause cancer.
13you can get cancer from the sun
14Indeed.
Air pollution probably can too.
13it's called skin cancer
13:P
14Skin Cancer
14><
4Everything gives you fucking cancer
4doesn't matter
14Indeed.
Sun beds win, they kill off all the idiots who use them.
4what was someone going on about the whole Diet Coke shit again
13I've never heard of Fucking Cancer [/smartass] XD
14LOL
13no
14xD
13I just remembered you saying that
14Rofl
I find it annoying well people say things like "If you drink too much water, you can die", and think they're extremely clever, if you do too much of anything, you will die.
Daces has a flash uploaded on her signature that appears to be working just fine
13lol
13One dude did die though, he drank a lot more water than I think anyone else can consume just to win a wii and he died the next day
Hold on I'll check
13like 20 of those HUGE "Arrowhead" water jug bottle things
13I think
13That's more than "a lot of water"
14LOL
14Dari ROFL
14I wonder if you do too much....nah nevermind
14It can.
I don't see anything within the avatar permissions that allows the changing of .swf extensions
I don't know she's my girlfriend
You have not seen her she operates on different sites
Yeah I saw that to but what does the flash setting on the signature have to do with the setting on the avatar
Well I just turned it on so try it
I don't think so
I would have seen the option for it by now
Looks like it...I guess you'll have to settle for it in your sig
Curse you phpBB3
I'm gonna have to find a mod to allow guest book using as well

Wow.
Someone made gravity with AS2.
what?
That's just...Amazing...
how the heck
my fan broke!
Lol.
great now my comp will overheat
Hm, I wonder how long before it catches fire.
i dunno...a matter of minutes
Wow.
You make gravity with physics laws.
how do you MAKE gravity?
You code it.
So you hit the ball away from the centre of the gravity, and it orbits it, until it is completely pulled into the centre of the gravity.
But the guy who made that must have been super clever.
...right
Wow.
He's good.
Really good.
well i'ma go...see ya later
Cya.
peace
Wow.
Some other guy used trigonometry to work out ball collision.
13some kids that I didn't even know at this one park started calling my name
13I must be all the rage at their school
13:P
13LOLOLOLOLOL OMG GUYS
13Do you guys remember that Spyroli chick?
?
Yeah.
13The one that wanted to be SR's boyfriend or whatever
LOL
13I was looking at that celestial spyro site
13and it said that she turned 10 years old today
13XDDDDDDDD
LOL
HAHAHAHA
13I know right
13I can't stop giggling
Damn youth these days is obsessed with 'boyfriends', and 'girlfriends'.
God, they need to frigging slow down.
13Yep
13hahaha
13Some chick that used to go to my school that friended me on MS seems a little like a whore
LOL
13Apparently she's dated a few people and she's around 12 years old.
Oo
13Then another keeps taking pictures in their underwear
Someone got pregnant at 12, at my sister's school.
13Some people around here are stupid
13I know
13I'm suprised the mom hasn't said anything
13because her mom was in one of those pics in the background

Well, he is stuck at a part where it is 5 allies vs. 1,000,000 deuche Iraqui soldiers, in a large room full of soldiers. He layed way in a back corner where he will not get shot, and is letting the allies do the hard work. [It's been 2 hours already, and nothing changed.]
12The mission where you have to go and find Al Alastad in the city. The large room is full of computers and is somewhat a television station.

7Zombie Genocidist is a bitch of an achievement.
On what game?
7They should make a Base mode, where you set up turrets, have more than 4 survivors, some extra weapons and endless zombies with no bosses or specials.
...
7L4D.
Oh.
7Nades, RPG launchers, artillery and a jeep with a mounted laser gun. The extra weapons of Base Mode.
7Proper nades.
7You won't need pipe bombs. It's harder to miss a zombie than hit.
7and if the zombies breach the walls, you can move up a level where there's MORE supplies, a single Baretta and some extra turrets to set on the single stairway.
7Zombie Genocidist heaven.
7and when you suck so much you get to the top level, three tanks just spawn and smash through the roof.

Lol, Bear Grylls.
4Usually being a pervert gets you in trouble in just about anything you do in life
Well, normally I don't get in trouble for it
but, one stupid mistake can screw everything up
He nearly drowned, lol.
4Maybe when you actually have to have a girlfriend who isn't every keen on liking someone obsessed with dragon on dragon action
My current girlfriend doesn't mind, but, right now, I can't risk anything
4Yeah right
She likes my writing.

LOL, his hands are bleeding.
7... I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
Hahaha, now he's playing with a bird-eating spider that bites and injects venom, and has "hair darts", as he puts it.
I'd laugh if it bit him.
Oh, it tried to bite him, it's got a good jump.
And now he's decided to eat it. Oo
Wth.
There's wild fowl in a rainforest.
And he manged to catch one. Oo
Hehe, the camera man fell over and cut himself.

Lol.
7Monty Python is finished
Alright, cya.
Hey Dari
Hey.
How are you?
Irritated
Why's that?
because of the stupid Mary-Sue concept
Oh, the character has a fucking common name
who gives a fuck
ITS A DAMN NAME!
Can't say I know what you're talking about.
but, that automatically labels the character a Mary-sue
in writing.
Does it really matter what someone else says?
You can ignore them.
No
but, its a freaking pain in the ass
I suppose.
Reading is supposed to be fun
Not something ridiculous
Wow.
hmm?
He's blocked pings.
So have I, lol.
how does one do that, and why would one need or want to do that?
It stops people from ping spamming you.
what is the purpose of pinging someone, btw?
And you can do that with a small script, or set options on a client.
To make them crash.
...
Oh right.
Misread what you said.
I just pinged myself and did not crash
BLARGH
I can't
My nose is in the way
It's a small message which when sent to someone is sent back to the person who sent it, and you are told how long it took for the ping to reach them.
So, how much lag between people there is.
Distance, etc.
ok
I like to learn things
Yeah
Things is good to learn.
I'm usually busy with something better
o_O
Like, talking to my boyfriend or something
watch your mouth
:3
Nah

7I can't join.
7so I turned off the wii.
7You were spazzing like anything in those races.
I know I havent played for about a week lol
Imma have some practice first
I did a mega save in rainbow road after that 8 thing
7Pfft. You should just choose random. Not even Rainbow road can best me now.
my front wheel was hanging on the edge and I did actually survive
7Lol.
7I only fell off once. You fell off like five times.
True :P
I'll have a practice then after if you're still here I'll have another go
I haven't played it in months.
In fact, all I've used my wii for in months is homebrew.
My wii is now an alarm clock.
Or a strobe light.
Or an emulator.
For PS1, Atari, N64, and...
Gameboy Colour
I could play pokemon blue on my wii, lol.
Oh, and SNES.
I can even turn off the safety messages. :P
And play DVD's on it.
It's got region free as well.
And some linux thing.
So I can play games I've downloaded. :P

10shame, I cant play on Halo Wars tonight now, not enough time lol
6oh yeh and one more thing
6michael schumaer showed more emotion
6while he was walking and how he sat which isnt what the stuig would do
10yeah
10oh my god, I have two flies mating on my window. They have no decency lol
6ha ha the top gear websites borken cause of everyone going on it to view the video of teh stig XD
6lol get a room!!!
10lol makes sense. I checked Wikipedia on Michael Shumacker and already someone had said he was the Stig within the first minute of it being shown
10and they've moved on now, probably to someone else's window, dirty gits lol
6XD ha ha
10Had to give my dog a bath before too, he decided to jump into a stagnant pond, repeatedly
6lol not ur day
/me 6dosent think that michael shumacker is the stig
10nope lol I have to get this chapter edited for someone too and I have writer's block. Plus, work in the morning so I cant even stay up late to finish it either lol
6lol unlucky mate
10Yep...and the house smells like boiled ham too
6hlol
6right heres proof
6In the first episode of the 13th series of Top Gear, broadcast on 21 June 2009, it was 'revealed' that The Stig is Michael Schumacher.[2] However, the fact that at the end of the show Jeremy Clarkson said "I'm not sure if Michael Schumacher is The Stig", and the fact that Michael Schumacher was listed in the credits as being a "guest star" both hint towards i
10it cut off
6oh yeh hang on
10after 'hint towards'
6it being an elaborate joke.
6which is figured anyway XD
6*i
10yeah, because without the Stig they remove a key point to their show
6yeh i know, with everyone endlessly wondering who he is, and its not the same without the stig
10yeah
13sup.
10hi
/me 6goes back to reading stig info
10lol
6ive found out one funny part
10go on
6James May claims that there is a clause in the Stig's contract that should his identity be exposed either through his own willingness or via a member of the Top Gear staff (including the hosts of Top Gear), he has to be fired. Black Stig was let go via this clause; the same clause would apply also to White Stig under the same circumstances
6lol
6no thats it
6it cut the full stop
6:P
10lol new stig then
6lol
6he will be fired if he is found out XD
13"Face it: You can be a total douche when it comes to indie music. Your iPod is chock full of bands who wear flannel button-up shirts and produce albums with dreamy, modern artwork on the cover. Your white earbuds are pretty much pasted inside your ears. You are quite proud of your obscure taste in music and you often scoff at people who limit their musical in
6eh?
13 musical to the popular radio stations. You probably have a detailed indie music blog that you update regularly and you attend concerts in small venues at least three times a month. You don't want to admit it, but most of your favorite bands can be heard on the local college radio station sooner or later.."
13Bahhaahahahaha
13how true

2Wait, no
Why not my curse - killswitch engage for the action?

13because I still fail quite a bit
But you make great hapy feet videos
13The only ones I can really choose from are the happy or country and I'd much rather do the happy but I can't think of much right now

Mr. Gusser was drafted.
10I hate Bidoof

13:P
All he has is a good Special Def.
Lol.
10And I wish Geodude and Zubat and wouldn't come back in EVERY SINGLE GAME
13I like to raise their levels before going crazy and catching everything in my sight
10The first cave in the game! What Pokemon will I find? OH LOOK, A ZUBAT. WHAT A SURPRISE.
I just get fed up of playing the same recycled game/story line over again, so I end up smashing the game on the floor and jumping on it.
13:LOL
10AND ANOTHER ONE!
happy/romance songs...why not a john mayor song?
10AND ANOTHER ONE!
2OH
2Erm

10Nothing since Gligar's evolved form
10GLISCOR, DURHURHUR
2You don't take a dog to the hospital :|
I always liked Gilgar.
I used to drw him.
10Gligar is one of my favorites.
*draw
*Gligar
13his evolution is stupid
10I'm not fond of Gliscor's pointy sometimes-man-nipples
Lol.
13LOL
2...
2WTF HAHAHA
Has anyone ever completed a pokemon game with no cheats?
As in, catch everything.
Get all to lvl 100.
13probably
The closest game I got to having everything was on pokemon blue.
13then died right after from not sleeping for days
Yes.
It's sad.
7 off all of them, or something.
JK
Although, in that one there were only about 100.
No, but I've gotten my six to 100.
13OK guys go on pokemon.com and then click pokedex, then go to number 472
Wow,

10Actually 463-467
2Argh, I keep dropping my pen D:<

Yeah same.

2There's a bit missing from my right middle finger, lololololol
2Well, due to pen-holdery
http://www.pokemonplatinum.com/#/pokemon/rotom/
Wow, sad.
My mom seemed to think it was soem kind of crisis when I learned how to write with a pencil/pen now.

No, liek a different option.
10It's from Cherrubi and... that other one
10Oh
10Those crappy new ones
Like how if you do things different they turn into something else.
10Like with Kirlia
10No more male Gardevoires
Yeah, but they had that in the second generation too.
Slowbro or Slowking.
10Dirteon
:P
10Ahhh that's right
Which should have just been all three.
In a row.
2I remember when I was in town with some randomers once and this man approached us and was like THE POWER OF JESUS WILL SAVE YOU
2He put his fingers on Matt's temples and said something like CAN YOU FEEL IT
Lol.
2It was scary, man
7there was a preacher at out school.
Really out of the blue? O was there more to it?
7except he was more like the boring old sod rather than vicar of dibley or the 'black church' stereotype priest
2Ee, this old guy called Roger used to come to our school but stopped when he trod on a pin and got an infection.
i have to go.
2Goodbye
Seeya.
7Best conversation opener I've heard on Omegle yet (from a lolz POV) "Stranger: Which genitals you have?"
13OOH OOH OOH
2...
13I just got an idea for a video
13l...O_O
13whoops
13lmao
2Idea you say, though?
2XDDDDDDD
13yep
2Go
10xDDDD
13anyways...hmm
2Says of idea!
2I speak engrish, yes
13there are some weird people on omegle
13but this one person was cool he was all like "DO I DAZZLE YOU???"
13It was funny
2xD
2My friend got asked by some foreigner something like 'Hi, I like to be your friend, you like?'
2I cant remember what site that was on, but it was hilarious
/me 10goes to the FUNZONE
13LOL
2Wait.... was it Borat?
2Funzone, eh? Have a nice trip
13Some dude that barely spoke english and was from Brazil or somewhere like that tried talking I got so bored I just left him there hahaha
2This lemonade tastes crappy
2XD
Someone working in a shop overheard my friend talking to someone called Ali, and said "Meos nameos Ali"
I suppose typing is as "Me-os" makes more sense.
10Caillou is on!
2I've just had an epiphany.
2BAM MARGERA LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE SYNYSTER GATES.
7we have a contender for most lolzworthy Omegle opener: You: hi Stranger: Do you like to touch children?
2.......
2Nice one.
7totally a fake.
7having a conversation now.
2mmmmmm
Who to say?
7Obviousness.
7The conversation was enough.
7If someone opens a conversation asking "Do youl ike to touch children?" then they deserve atleast a slight hesiation of "...wut?"
7You: Ok, you crossed the line between funny and disgusting somewhere in that sentance, if you're a troll. If not... ew. Your conversational partner has disconnected.
Wow, I got a normal person.
Stranger: hi
You: Hey.
Stranger: hows it going?
You: Fine thanks, you?
Stranger: yeah pretty we
ll*
2Wow, a normal person?
Yep.

10Eurgh

10I was nine
2Lalz, how old are you now?

2Erm, not
Stranger: hi You: Hi. Stranger: asl You: Age: 43 Sex: Male Location: Under your bed
2Hey RDX
2...WTF
Then the person disconnected.
Funny.
7I know.
2I wonder why
I keep getting normal people. :(
All they say is "hi".
10Poor dari
"Stranger: who's it going?"
Oo
7some of the weirdos you have to flesh out
7you get a lot of engrish too
7Stranger: plus i don't watch tv, i find it a waste of time You: yet you go on Omegle. Interesting form of opinion.

2Stranger: Tell me your deepest darkest secret. You: Hmm... You: I like men. Stranger: Thats all? You: Yeah dude.
2FAILURE
13I wonder if I'll bump into you guys
2BWAHAHA
2if you find some kazakhstan man called brian who is the 13 it may be moi
10Sesame Street is on next!
10Yaaay
10The thing I don't get about Elmo is that he's, what, five living in his own apartment with a fish and a strange man in his closet
Stranger: straight male bondage bitch dislikes: scat piss and beastality interested in a female mistress
You: Hm, I wonder what the chance is that you are some angsty 13 year-old, attempting to humour himself, as you are too stupid to do anything resourceful.
Stranger: definetly not slim so im guess none
You: I do not speak Engrish.
Stranger: slim to none
He spoke Engrish.
2Stranger: if you don't have a vagina then disconnect You: INNIIT
2WTF they disconnected for me
2That failed somewhat
What I find funny is that he was so stupid, he failed to realise that I wasn't doing anything resourceful either.
13You: all toasters toast toast Stranger: hi Stranger: asl? You: I need 2 seata bike You: U HAV 2 SEETA BIKE Stranger: yeah!! Your conversational partner has disconnected.

Found what qq is.
lol penguins?
10I knew it was some sort of odd online game.
10Then again, aren't they all odd?
I thought it was a messenger. Oo
um...yeah
10CP spinoff!
13lul
huh?
...
10Is he a youngster
10Or a supernerd? Or POKEMANIAC
4:O
10Wait... they got rid of those
Hello
10Oooh yeah
4sup dude
Nothing much you?
4tired
4as usual
4XD
Everything in pokemon is backwards, like Ekans being snake backwards, therefore that in the game I'm crap is backwards, meaning in real life, I'm awesome.
tired? lol
4I've only had about 5 hours of sleep in the last 96 hours
2o_o and your still awake
2wow
Hahaha.
4yeah I'll collapse eventually
Lack of sleep is funny.
4and now I have to write a resume
Oo
10Why do cats always lay on clean clothes?
Why?
13I don't know how late I was up last night but it was past midnight when I started reading the other half of the newest warriors book, I read over 100 pages and those books have bigger pages than other books and I finished it and then it took me a while after that to fall asleep
4I'm applying for a new position
Ahh.
10You like Warriors?
10I'm not into it anymore
4damn you procrastination
I thought you liked just being able to fill in forms and tell people they are crap at their jobs and should try harder, or whatever you said you do.
4I do like what I do
10Not after Hollyleafpaw decided she had to SAVE SHADOWCLAN FORM THEMSELVES
13I'm not a HUGE fan like people that go crazy and RP and stuff but
4But i still want to get paid more
Which usually means more work.
:P
10*from
10I like the first series, and that's about it for me
4Not in Coca-Cola it doesn't lol
4I would actually be doing less work
LOL
13the last one in that series is so sad
Good luck with it then. :)
13in the power of three series I mean
Books can't be sad.
Only funny.
When all the main characters die.
2lol right?
I need to find a book where that happens.
13Kathryn Lasky just REFUSES to let Soren die...-___-
10I just know that Lionblazeheart does something terribly ebil
13I'm not a big reader anymore
10And Jaycrowfeather is angsty as ever!
13Hollyleaf just kills herself
13at the end
10Ooooh
13right after almost forcing her real mom to eat deathberries
2brb for a while. I'm gonna continue my story on a fourum
10REAL MOM
10Woo I knew it'
13brb...
10No way in hell did Sandstorm give birth to the three musketeers
10i mean...
10Squirrelflight
10gah
13back
13Yep
10Is it Jayfe - oh, I knew it
13Want me to give you full spoilers?
10Jaycrowfeather...
10Yes
13even though it was obvious
10I thought so
13XD
13I always thought that Squirrelflight was the one that killed Ashfur but it was really Hollyleaf
10Which is why I laughed at all the people who threw a fit when someone suggested that Flyingsquirrel wasn't their mum
10Oh yeah, Ashfur dies. Someone spoiled that for me on the internet. How?
13Ashfur was going to kill the three to "break Squirrelflight's heart after she broke his" and she says that they aren't her kits to save them
13Ashfur was planning on telling everyone at the next gathering
13so they killed him
13well Hollyleaf did
10Did this happen int he fifth book?
13he was killed at the end of the 5th
13yeah
10Ah
10Anything of interest happen before then
10Besides ShadowClan becoming heathens
13hmm
13the clan thinks that Sol killed him so they went on a long boring journey to bring them back
10Fun
10Sooo what happened in the sixth book
13that's it
13and starting at "the three find out that truth" that's pretty much near the end of the book
13so yeah
10Nothing about the ebil Lionblazeheart or crotchety Jaycrowfeather?
13hmmmm
13Idk I read the first half of the book a long time ago
10Oh
10Hrm
10I hope they kill Fireheartstar in the last series
10I liked him in the first series but after that...
10it's KITTY STRANGLING TIME
13so yeah
13they've already got another whole saga planned
10oh woopity doopity
13and they're doing another one of those "special editon" books like the one with earthclan or whatever
13but it's about Bluestar

13I've been scarred for life by northwest indian herritage
Whos idea was that...?
Whose*
4Political Correctness ftw

13The Europeans that came to Europe thought that they were in India because they wanted to find out if they fell off the edge of the earth or not
13or whatever

By Europeans, do you mean English?

6SO TAKE THAT YOU PIECES OF SHIT WHO WANT US OT HAVE THE EURO!!! :D :D
Because Europe sucks.
Hehehe.
6yep
6truer words were never spoken
UK is so awesome that it's tiny compared to the US, but has had a bigger empire than it, much bigger.
6^very true
6we owned 3/4 of the world :D
13UK sucks because even in public schools there you have to wear uniforms
Win!
6or was it a 1/4 ?
13:P
I like my uniform.
4And it was funny that most of those locations were primitives or colonies
Suit + Tie
6RDX: its still land thats bigger than yours :P
4so
4I'm just pointing it out :P
10Oh joy, the US vs. UK crap. Tell me when it's over.

6yep, we have cars older than you :P probaly
6*your history
4prolly
6u did know i meant the car thing as a joke right?
4dude I don't know the difference between anything right now
Funny.
6XD yeh funny that aint it?
Did that get cut off?
Where'd it stop?
6war.
4no it's up
Oh, ok.
4at least I see it
4I can't speak for the Democratic administration of the time lol
6i can see it
Well, if he did, it worked.
4they did know
6^ lol
6yeh, you were half an hour behind or something after the attack
To be honest, I would have thought that even if we told them that they were going to be attacked, that the fact that they were being attacked would bring them into the war.
Ah.
There's that, I suppose, but how would Japan know?
4who knows
4Japan had scouts all over Pearl Harbor man
You would have thought they'd stick out like a sore thumb.
4not really
4that's why they started putting them in camps
6well people got their revenge with the A bombs i guess
I've seen some, they still look Japanese.
4but they still had plenty of information before the attack
4who knows how it would have turned out
Apparently Haig (English commander in WW1) sent cavalry charges against huge machine guns.
4wouldn't surprise me
4those poor polish bastards had to use cavalry against tanks
I can't remember the figures of the battle of the
6not nice at all...
Somme.
4the Somme was horrible
6the french were rubbish in WW2
4The french have always been rubbis
4h
6they used cavarly against tanks to against the blitzkrieg
4want to read something cool?
6RDX: true
6yeh ok
4hold on let me find it
Germany crushed France. Lol.
6they always do
6and the english have done that to
4http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/france.html
Wow, weird domain.
4popular though
4read it lol
LOL
6lol im at the start and i can see a pattern
France got conquered by ITALY?
4technically lol
4if you count the Romans
6makes sense
Well, the Romans > Italians, and by that I mean the Romans were better than modern day Italians.
4obviously yes
4but they still come from Italy
6was it the romans who were the last to successfully invade britain?
4no
4the Normans
But Italy was formed in the 1800's, or something.
6oh yeh
So technically it wasn't Italy at the time.
6well the normans then that was it
"France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman."
4you know your technicality goes to your head
LOL
6XD
LOL, they lost to Italy again!
6LOL
6"Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes refuge in a McDonald's."
6^ biggest fail ever
6ha ha
4- French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French.
Going now.

2I'm having a convo about wine gums!
2WTF MAN

13Yeah but I don't have wifi
You don't have a router than handles wireless?
2http://www.mibbit.com/pb/bGe53m
13I HAVE NO WIFI :P THAT MEANS NO WIFI, silly.
Do you have a router.
2...fail
Hey SR.
7Stranger: hey You: hi Stranger: asl? You: within thr normal span of human years/you try and guess ;)/Earth. Stranger: just tell me where you are from You: Earth. You: .. oh, alright then. You: Buarga 3, ninth planet of the Bunglarian system and third of the Buarga empire. Happy now? Your conversational partner has disconnected.
Hey.
2Hi SR

13Then why are you asking if I have a router for one
13I have no wifi for my DS
If your router can handle wireless connections, which most can, you can use it for your DS.
2I do, but I never use it
Network swtich: http://images.tigerdirect.ca/skuimages/large/N100-1400-main.jpg
Someone is trying to teach me Chinese.
O_o
I asked if they were a fortune cookie.
2xD
For DS wifi to work you need either the wifi dongle for your PC to broadcast wifi to your DS, or a wifi router.
13LOL really
Mhm.
13I don't know anything about wifi and stuff because I never use wireless on my computer or anything else
13I don't know.
Brand + model number?

13I'm not trying to get wifi he just keeps questioning me
Does your router have an antenna?
:P
13it's linksys
Its most likley wifi
also linksys does make switches
Mine's quite old and does wifi.
13Yes.
The guy accused me of talking to cookies alone because I can't speak Chinese.
Has antennas?
If it has antennas it has wifi
Hey, that's my router.
Wth.
WRT54GS
Linksys routers all look the same

Today, my five year old daughter was watching cartoons on TV. Then a Barbie commercial came on. My daughter sang along with the theme song "Be who you want to be, B-A-R-B-I-E." She then turned to me and said "Mom, I want to be a hooker." FML
7Today, I had a horrible day at work, came home early and burst into tears as soon as I was in the door. I curled up on the sofa, still bawling, and my cat came over and jumped up for a cuddle. I gave her a hug and she threw up down my back. FML
7Today, my adorable 8 year old son told me he no longer wanted me to pick him up from school. When I asked why he said. "I told everyone at school my mommy is pretty... and I don't want people to know I lied". FML
hahahahhah
Ouch.
7Today, a man came up to me at the bus stop. He went into this long story about how his girlfriend is pregnant and they both haven't eaten in days. Trying to be tough and funny I said back, "sounds like you should invest in condoms instead of food." He responded by beating and robbing me. FML
Woot
I have lawnmower pokemon.
Today, I was on the phone with a prospective blind date. He asked me to describe myself so I said that I was fun, attractive and a little chubby but not fat. My 7 year old sister walked up to me and screamed "Jesus doesn't like it when we lie!". FML
LOL

2aw man my cable or wire snapped. now i can't amplify my guitar :/
6Hey Dari
Hey.
6I knew eht
6*hugs*
7*hugs*
Why don't you just break in? That's what I do when I forget my keys.
Although last time I ended up with about 20 spinters in my arm.
And then I put lemon juice on it.
7Because all my methods of breaking in that don't require things being broken have been removed. If I break something I'll have to pay for it and I'm totally skint.
Climb onto the roof.
Usually windows open there.
6SF!
lol
6=D
yay
6lolus
Gah my dang cable broke
6D;
7Dari: No, no trampoline and I don't think the shed roof can support my weight (it's a cheap roof, and the only way to get onto the garage roof)
6*D:
7The trampoline was the only way to get onto the shed roof anyway
It's the wire that hooks up my guitar to the amplifiyer...Now my guitar sounds like...(tink)
6wtf
6DDD:
I can quite easilly climb onto my garage roof, although, I broke through the roof.
Trampolines are not the only way KJ
6lol
unless your crazy
I should have just used a ladder, I didn't think about it at the time.
lol
6UGH
D=
lol no one has guessed what that thing is on my DA yet
7Dari: the garage roof is fucking high. Our garage also has a loft/attic
Still, generally, it's easy to climb onto houses.
Most have drain pipes.
Those are extremely easy to climb.
6No..
6Though I am hungry..
2ah
6And my hand still has those marks..-_-
2why don't you eat something?
2oh

2Ah. Okay so it's decent time to stay awake...kinda

/me wonders why he never sees /me's any more.
7Because you don't understand the simplest things we tell you. Then when we explain, you get all pissy and take offence. Honestly, Dari, take the simple route with him if he lies as badly as this.

DSi sucks.
Flash cards don't work with it.
I've got an old school original DS.......... a pink one XD
Although, I'm sure it won't be long till it gets hacked.
My dad was very wrong in thinking my sister and I liked the pink DS's. D:<
13I have the original DS too
13Mine's red
13my mom has a blue DSi
Mine is nearly falling apart and is scratched like hell :| both screens are on the verge of being so scratched you cant see/use them
Eep, Sidewinder by A7x sounds like some kind of Hawaiian song thing near the end

Oh, and the reason I asked if you had wifi, is because for a limited time, they are distributing a "special key" via wifi.
Uxie was a bitch to catch

I just got them from pokemon that came from Pal Park.
R U SHUR
And they came from emerald...
Which had a pokemon cloning glitch...

So, no cheats, or hacks. All legitimate. :P

Woohoo, Acey's back on msn :D
I wonder if there's any new wii homebrew stuff. Oo
Did you get the web browser for Wii or were you too late like I was?
I got it.
Did they remove it?
13JUST MAKING SURE YOU HEARD!
Oh, you mean the free version.
13"I GOT IT"
No, I got the wii points one.
Yeah, I think it went unfree after April 07
Using "Star points".
So, no, I didn't pay for it.
ahaha
But it wasn't illegal.
You use the codes from games you buy to get star points, and trade those for wii points.
Ah, like a freebie! I remember my freebie spree where I just sent off for a shitload of free samples of crap cos I was bored one day
Lol.
:O It doesnt work when I say it!
either that or my music is too loud
Scripts don't work for the person who is running it.
Unless written to do so.
Fff.
F for FIAL
And yes, it is a script, it's just built-in.
'Mmmmmmm, ham sandwich' in the middle of a guitar solo just sounded preeeeetty epic
7In Guitar Hero I was playing the English concert, and Beat It came on. My dad came in, and started yellnig at me about not honouring the dead or some shit like that. He refused to believe it was a concert encore, so I just said "I was honouring him" so he'd just leave me alone. Then he goes on about endoring pedophillia and at this point I'm like "Fuck you
7"Fuck you, the song's done now."
...
My sister and I were talking about MJ this morning but neither of us knew he was even dead!Q
oops
MJ wasn't a paedophile. :P
7Regardless.
7I think he just wanted to be a dickhead.
7That fucking cat is back in the garden..
He just wanted to be a kid. Oo
The cat in the garden wanted to be a kid...? XD
Thats what it looked like to me

13...
13meh
13:(
Its not just a story...
every word of it is true
6O_O
7.... that was odd
6If you say so..
Woo.
6o.o
What's not just a story?
The Ricebowl story
6Wtf
What ricebowl story.
Hmm
I'm writing the ricebowl story
and you'll understand why
Not with my ricebowl you don't
...
Wth are you on about.
What's a "ricebowl" story.
Ricebowls
its only the most perverted story in the world
...
Explain.
which is why, a ricebowl is the universal sign of the pervert
of the SUPER pervert
Not going to, its far too dirty for this chatroom ^.^
I demand that you explain. Now.
No
I refuse
Wait until I finish the story
7Long story short,
Fine, you force me to look it up then.
if you have a DA I'll give you the link, but, I warn you, its very dirty, only for ages 18+
7No-one likes him, no-one believes he has a girlfriend, or gives a crap to a word he says yet he keeps coming back
I look it up, and it comes up with children's stories...
Yeah, so dirty.
The true ricebowl story
involves a guy fucking a ricebowl
meant only for adults
...
There are many versions
A story about someone having sex with a bowl..?
Yes
basically
a super pervert
and someone walks in on him
asking him to join or something like that
only to get "Not with my ricebowl you don't"
That's not really perverted. It's just stupid.
Uh...
No one has sex with a bowl.
Not true
6Holy crap...I had forgoten that this place came to life...o.o
I know several people
Very true.
People have sex with beagals
or bread
warmed
Yes, why?
I rest my case.
Where do you live?
UK.
The land of the normal.
Ahh
Yes
everyone wants you people to think the same
Wrong.
I disagree with almost everyone.
I disagree with everyone end of story
What does that have to do with anything?
7You can't claim 'end of story' as if your opnion actually matters enough to end it
I Don't understand why I come on here when I'm constantly ridiculed.
Oh well.
So its just hot-air to me.
You aren't constantly ridiculed. I just don't agree with what you just said.
7And I'm always on.
7So shoo.
hmm
No
7Long story short, no-one likes him, no-one believes he has a girlfriend, or gives a crap to a word he says yet he keeps coming back
6wtf
He just repeated himself
7Yeah, the point stands
There isn't any point to you, you're just blowing hot air
7You should really get that broken record fixed.
I wouldn't be talking about broken records, since you've broken so many before I even knew about Spyrochat.
That didn't come out right...
Actually, I don't even know why I'm thinking like this anymore
I should just shut up for the time being

Thanks :)
No problem.
Hey
9Hey Deathtbat

It doesn't really seem perverted, as I said earlier. It's just weird. Really weird.
just read the story
I did.
9Random, really
Did you like it?
9It was above average, but not that great
...
Yeah
I haven't really written anything in a while

True, true.
Alrighty
Listen, leave my mom out of this and I'll leave this out of your mom.

Damnit. A pleaser.
I'll have to draw on extra reserves.
Dari, prepare my ship.
UR NAN!

Nan?
:P
9Can your ship help me with matricide?
You don't know how much I wish I knew what that word meant.
Kelcey's going near the boat, she says
9lol
No, wait, ON the boat
"I'm gonna touch the butt!"
9Matricide= killing of one's mommy
Ah.
o.O
Makes sense.
Maternal/cide
9Yeah.
It's all about root words, kiddies.
9The More You Know?
XD
I love that episode of Family Guy.
At the Indian casion.
*casino
9Yeah
9Oh did you see the one when Stewie is disappointed with his future self?
Yup.
Lolz.
9 35 and never...yeah.
Have you seen where Peter discovers that his house is not a part of Quahog or the US, so he makes it his own country?
9No
It's epic.
9I'll check it out
9That reminds me
Mayor West: You're not part of this town... or the United States, Mr. Griffin. That makes you a Communist!"
9XD
9"Everyone who sees Peter Griffin must throw apples at him."
And you see the map of the town, and where Peter lives there's just a black square.
Wait, do you know what Y2K was?
Because there's another about that.
9The episode when Lois kills Stewie?
No.
9Oh.
I thought you said everyone must throw nipples at him.
So in the episode all of the world's nukes are launched as a result of Y2K, and Quahog is destroyed, etcetera.
9That sounds cool.
Oo
So The Griffins kind of find a Twinkee factory and build a new town there.
Very funny.
http://engrishfunny.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/engrish-funny-care-shippery.jpg
9lmfao Twinkie factory...Peter must like that....
"There are only two things that could survive a nuclear attack; cockroaches and Twinkees."
9Of course.
Cockroaches have two brains. O_o
13hi

Seeya.
N00bz.
9I'm trying to shorten Adult's life.
13Why?
13What's she doing
9She is just a piece of shit.
13What'd she do
9She's already doing bad things for her body anyway
13Bulimic or worse?
9Not bulimia or anorexia
9But just as bad
13Wrist cutting? Drugs?
13Idk
9Nooo, though she DOES watch inappropriate shows
9She doesn't brush her teeth
13Smoking?
9lolno
9She doesn't eat right
9So has poor hygiene
13As in CANDY HERSEY CHOCO BAR?
9XDDD
9Well she waits under afternoon to eat, and it's usually lunchables or SPAM meat
13ummm
13what's wrong with eating whenever you want
9No, but she could DIE
13oh yeah she has that disorder right
http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/9/9e/Arguecat.PNG
9She's perfectly aware of it
13Maybe she's suicidal then?
9....
9Well she accuses me of
9She saw me pick up a butter knife and freaked out
13...seriously?
13Maybe she's paranoid
9Idk
13I myself have a pretty vivid and fucked up mind
9Everyone does
13not everyone
13mehh
9Well to themselves
9I refused to make me macaroni, then she has a sissy fit and starts screaming and crying like someone dropped a chainsaw on her
9*to make HER
13wpw
13*wow
13Caillou-circus-episode much?
9Eventually I did, but put a whole stick of butter in, and whenever she asks for a drink, I dump a lot of sugar in it
9And lol exactly
13"ITS TODAAAAAY! I GOT ALL DRESSED!!! ITS TODAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
9XD
13Why are you trying to kill her though? That's...that's just terrible
9Idk
13You "don't know"?
13....
9Not kill her, just so she starts vomiting again
13..
9That's one of the symotons
9*symptons
9It stopped for a while, so she thinks she's all better
13Just tell her to make her food herself if she's that starving
9Well when she does, it's bad for her
13You're not helping that much with the butter and sugar...
9Eh
9Me: You don't brush your teeth Adult: WELL AT LEAST MY DEAD DOESN'T THINK I'M CRAZY
9*dad
13Do you really hate her that much that you want to "shorten her life"
13awh that's mean :(
9No
9It's normal
9Daily routine
13Why do families get more and more fucked up everyday?
13gah.
9I know, it's disgusting
9A house near us had 7 kids who were living in squalor
13Soon my parents will probably be divorcing and I'm worried sick about what's going to happen for me school-wise
9:(
9Do they even try to work things out?
13and for my dad since he has alcohol issues AND doesn't have a job in the big "crisis" going on
9Didn't he tone down a bit?
13nope.
13He tried to hide smoking too
9...
9He needs to take responsibility
13I'm pretty much screwed right now
13"They told me I had to go to rehab, I said no. No. No."
9*hugs*
9Wait, he uses your mom's money for drugs?
13"I'm going down to the store" x 3 a day
9She needs to prevent him
13She can't though
9True I guess
13If we ban alcohol he'll just try to get one off of the neighbor's or go to RR's house and have beer there
9Why does he want to screw everything up more?
13Because he can't stop
13addiction
9I know but...
9Fuck I'm never going to drink beer
13Me either, I don't want to end up the way he has
13:(
9Did you try talking to him?
13If I do he'll get piss mad
13He gets mad if I ever say ANYTHING even to my pets while he's watching his precious cooking shows and/or sports
13So I pretty much hide in the back room on my computer all day
13><
9Wow
13What?
9Ex. If you don't like how a food taste, say 'Ew this tastes like beer"
13LOLnah...
13I had alcohol once by accident, I thought it was my soda
13it does taste terrible
13I don't see how people are addicted to it
9Yeah you told me
9Wine is good
9Beer= bleh
9Maybe people just like being drunk, and after that get used to and eventually like the taste
13Yeah perhaps.
9Maybe: *trips* "Wow I'm clumsy, like drunk"
13the thing is my dad always denies being drunk
13so that stuff will never work
9Video tape?
13I've already tried that
13I can't really do anything about it
9Fuckshit
9Wait, you said that he doesn't want to hear you talk...?
13he doesn't like it when I talk while he's watching shows or if I ask him anything
9Wow
9Um, does your mom say anything?
13my mom's always at work
9Damn
9Btw, a couple can divorce but still live together
13they're never going to live together ever again after, they've made that very clear.
9Would your dad live with your uncle?
13I don't know where the hell he'd live
9If he lives somewhere you can visit him if he wants, then maybe this is actually better for you
13Yes, but then there's schooling issues
9Tutors?
13There's no way in hell I'm ever going to go somewhere for school so my parents better figure that shit out
13I told my mom I'd rather just stay home and do pages in books that are marked for each day but I don't think she's too hot on the idea yet
13which is stupid
13Not going to school has great benefits
9Well obviously she won't like that idea
13How is it obvious
13It's not bad
9Well you won't learn that much
13Yes I will? They have homeschool books for a reason
13That's all I did for school the past couple years and I'm doing just fine
9But I mean without an adult
9And she won't know if you did it
13Yeah she would, she can look in the book and if there's writing in there that means I did it
13Duh
13:P
13I don't need someone standing over me to do my work
9I was about to look up Seattle schools, but then I realized that was a dumb idea
13...Looool
9"Eckstein.." wtf kind of name is that
13A name for redneck schools in Texas, perhaps
13lul
9lol it's in Seattle
13NAW
13LIES
9http://www.greatschools.net/city/Seattle/WA
13Stalkerrrrr
9I don't trust reviews, there could still be bullying
13haha JK
9XD
9Damn I suck
13There's bitches in every school, all reviews are lies
9I know
9But some are stricter
9And if someone gets in trouble, they're kicked out right away
13yeah but those are probably private schools where I'd be forced to wear dress shoes and redneck jeans :(
9XD
13with a 70 year old woman that will take my hat and throw it down the hall screaming "I CANT TAKE IT ANYMOOOOORE!"
9XDD
9There's a public school like what I mentioned before in NYC
9Hopefully I'll go there
13ya?
13*yay
9I guess
13I'd want to go there and kick some ass just to get kicked out then
9XD
13It'll be fun
13"HAY EVERYBODY! *kickshin*"
9You know, middle school is the failingst torture, and there's one year left, so if you start now and just use Daria comebacks...
13You're a year ahead of me, remember? :P
9Oh yeah...
13"And he should know, he's in grade THREE!"
9Sometimes they skip you up a year if you were homeschooled before, maybe it can work...
13nahhh
13I don't ever want to go to that whipping house ever again
9But you'll be safe from the outside world
13NAW
13:P
13oh shit
9What?
13Pepboys have dominated Owlpages DDDD:

9\What happened to him?
13Idk...
9He left and took the kids
13XD
13never heard about him since
13I don't know
13LOL
9He invaded our base
9Coming in from Sector 2

Ah, no. Been meaning to.
Seeya Mikeh.
13Bye
9Bye bye
Bye bye bye
9She tore out my heart
LOL
9And took the kids
Dirty hag.
A millstone around my neck...
9A burnt part of my cookie, a nonblack blood cell in my tear ducts...
Lolz.
"Like a crooked, burnt-out saint I believe."
9Like a saint good at his job
I resnt that.
:P
9Sorry
Lol, it's okay.
I'm game for a debate if you're in the mood.
9For now.
9And sure.
Alright, you first.
I'm a bit distracted right now.
9If God exists, then he's not fair.
Elaborate.
9In the Bible, a man pronounces a name wrong, so him and 42 children are killed.
Erm, no.
It was a little bit more than that. ;)
9lol
9Well there's also the sexism
He didn't say his name wrong, that's JW stuff.
9JW?
The guy was blaspheming, if you know what that means.
Jehovah's Witness.
9Oh.
9But those kids were innocent.
If you're thinking of the same guy I was.
Can you list where this is, so I can help you out more?
9wait, I have it saved somewhere...
Ok. Perfect.
9Judges 12:5-6
9No, 42 THOUSAND
Lemme look it up.
Ah.
Found it.
That was an Ephraimite who was hindering the Hebrew army.
9So those people were enemies?
He purposely said it wrong, and it was more that he wouldn't let them pass than his missaying on purpose.
Yeah, basically.
But the point i'm trying to make is that God wasn't like "lol pwnd u"
9XD
9Well exactly with the war part: Pro-life, yet pro-war for their beliefs?
And the 42, 000 were soldiers.
9Yeah, I confused the children with another passage
Pro-life means that everyone has a right to live, but God can only tolerate obnoxious/blaspheming poeple for so long.
Not to aention he would go to any length to protect His children while they're following him.
And pro-life most applys to babies anyway.
*applies
9But they'd rather a young man/woman with family die than a bunch of cells/old, suffering, dying man?
Good point. It's the heart that counts, not their age. He works in ways we can't always undertsand, but a lot of what he does is explained.
I hope that answered it right.
9Eh....well for you.
9You're a strong debater though
No, I mean, if it doesn't help ask me to go into it more. And thanks.
9It's fine.
'K.
9But, um, what about the sexism?
Well, give me an example.
9If an unengaged woman is raped, she and the man must be married forever.
Err, what? No.
9It says it.
Show me.
I highly doubt that.
9wait,,,
Sure, no prob.
9Deutoronomy 22: 28-29
Searchin'.
Ah, I see.
OK, picture this virgin right.
9Yeah
She's prolly a young person in the context, I'd guess.
Now she's gonna have this kid, and prolly not be able to support it. That's why the guy has to pay her and help support the kid.
I don't really get the marrying part, I'm gonna admit I'm cinfused on that.
9And "never divorce"?
I'll find out for you.
*confused
Also, that's not really sexism lol.
9A man can have female slaves
Everyone in that time did that, it wasn't enouraged though I'm pretty sure. Like a ton of guys have multiple wives and crap, it was kind of the custom of the day. I mean, women have been jipped of their rights for most of history, it's an unfortunate truth.
9Yeah, a law was ONLY JUST passed that women get the same wages as men
Also, I think I may have found a decent answer:
"In that time a woman who had been raped would never have been able to find a husband. And with no husband, she would have been doomed to absolute poverty. In fact prostitution would have been her only real option. The law that the rapist would have to marry her and never leave her was to protect her from such a terrible future. No other culture or religion h
had any such protection for a woman treated so shabbily.
So basically the "answer" to this is that this is meant as a punishment for the rapist. The rapist has to pay the father and has to be married to her to provide for her for all of her life (as a woman who wasn't a virgin could not find a husband anymore).
Woah, sorry for that block of text.
9Well, thanks for the decent answer
9Though I doubt the husband would be a good one
Those are someone else's words not mine, but they pretty much alude to what I said. A lot of these are problems from ancient times, not really applicable to today when women a much more potent place in the world.
*have a
9I know, but another point is that the Bible doesn't really apply to our times
Good retort. Well, take into consideration that even though this book was written thousands of years ago it has told of events that happened thousands of years after its publication.
9Like....
Check out Revelation and Isaiah, if you don'r believe me.
*don't
9Okay, when I find a copy
What if I told you that stuff happening right now was there? Because I really believe it is.
9I don't want to change your beliefs.
9I doubt I can, if my weak debates, but if you want, we can end.
9*with
No, your debates make a lot of sense.
I'm jsut trying my best to answer them/
And I don't wanna push stuff on you, I just hope I can help you out with some obscure stuff.
We'll end if you want.
9Well I just want to say that a new culture was discovered just recently, and they got along fine without a God.
9So if they went to hell for something they never heard of, it would be unfair.
Ah, that's where it gets interesting.
God promises that everyone has a chance to choose before they die.
wtf
Except for babies, since there's an age of accountability you know.
Lol
Hey RDX
4please tell me you are not arguing about religion

9...?
13what
6?? how the hell do u expect us to remember 2 years ago?
6even though i wasnt there....
13not you :P
13XD
When I first joined, me and Ivy got into a little fight in a Cyprus/Disney topic.
6lol
I told her Miley was rapidly become a slut/Britney Spears remake
9Oh i think I do
She got mad at me because hs rthoguth Miley was a sweet, innocent girl.
I promise I didn't make this crap up.
9And you won, with hindsight
13LOL yeah now I remember
*she thought
13"Miley wasn't forced to stardom like Britney!"
6XD sounds funny, shame i missed it :(
6lol
Yeah.
13Yeah RIGHT
13her precious daddy rolled out the red carpet the day she was born
XD
Yup.
6XD
Well anyway, the prophecy is fulfilled, lol.
13I can tell that the brother really doesn't want to do with either of them though
9Over-fulfilled.
Brother?
9He has a band
She has a brother?
13He is Cyprusboy
Interesting.
13but he's a little better
I assume he's older?
13Probably
9Bye.
I believe I was supended from the forum for like a day for saying that to that FrostBite person.
13...bye...?
13Who?
She told me in PM she had to go.
There was someone named Frost something, who made the topic.
Frostheart?
I dunno.
13Yeah you're so SPECIAL aren't you
13I remember her
13SHe likes the Jonass sisters btw

13"I'm not allowed to friend anyone on here unless I know who they are in real life, sorry! :("
LOL
Is it just me, or does it bother you that 80% of the female US population decide that pretty boys are the teen idols now?
13what?
Never mind. Lol, for fun say you know her IRL.
You're a friend of a friend.
13I should say "You know me, this is Britney! You don't remember me from 1st grade? :("
Find out who one of her friends' names is, and say that's your mutual friend.
13looool

Some things in pokemon are so screwed up.
"Look at the luster of my pokemon's fur!" *Sends out pokemon without fur*
13You know what's really screwed up about Pokemon?
13I was reading up in one of those big "Pokedex" books that has like maps and whole guides to the Diamond/Pearl/Platinum games
The move "Gastro Acid", described as "The user hurls up its stomach acids on the foe. The fluid eliminates the effect of the foe's ability", is classed as a beauty move in contests.
13On one of the pages it says "You must think this chick is a Pokemon groupie, because she's still standing out there!" I was like WHAT THE HELL ISN'T THIS MAINLY AIMED AT KIDS
LOL

7I tried to flee in the train but they fired fireballs at me and actually blew up the second carriage, and made the first one flip onto its head.

7I love the new twitch weaponry SF.
7It's down the bottom.
7If you hold right click, you can move the corsshair.
6UGH
7I also like steyr AUG A1 of CS:S realistic weapons.

7P90 and dual berettas has replaced M4 and deagle in antwars
have you played half life 2?
You're blinded by greed.
7Yeah.
7You got gmod on the computer?
try the 3P on a headcrab and see how long it takes you to kill it
7You got gmod on the computer?
me? if so then no
7If so, HL2 EP1 & EP2?
7...oh.
7Then hahahaha! Gmod sucks for 360.
but i do watch my friends play it
7You don't get ANYTHIIIIING.
True
But i have a laptop so it won't be the best to aim
7You get only the default shitty crap Garry makes.
or move
yeah ha ha
7Then get a mouse.
i don't have a mouse
7I love how he claims his game has the best stuff, and starts listing off stuff. I recorded it all, went back to check the list later, and found out he listed incredibly common stuff /players/ created.
I assume you have cat then?
7Then /get/ a mouse.
If there's no mouse left.

7My beta is the dragon SNPC. I have full gmod.

use a crowbar on them lol. and try not to die
7They need to make Archangle SNPCs to fight the dragons!
Reign of Fire mod?
7Flies. If you get close enough to melee you get clawed, or bitten, or smashed with tail.
Ah.
7It's just a dragon NPC some awesome guy made.
Because you said Archangle.
7It doesn't swoop, it hovers.

7I'm referring to RoF, yes. But there's no RoF mod.

There's a movie called Sphere based on a sphere under the ocean.
Hello
13Is there?
13I actually had gotten the idea from a book
Yeah, almost exactly how you pictured it in the RP
It's abook too
The movie is based on that
Oh fuck, I didn't realize how close to my flight time it is o.o
13weird, that's not where I got it from
Michael Crichton, me thinks.
6lol
Not leaving yet :P

But it's close
He wrote JP
6kk
...
Wth? Oo

Protal! Woo
13*portal
6but still a good film
13Yep
13Only anime I like
6totoro is scary lol
That's pretty freaky.
13I've seen Totoro
13I don't even remember the storyline though
In Sphere there's a human ship that feel through a black hole while bringing the Sphere back and thus landed like 300 years in the past.

Sooo....I'm stuck in the 3rd ring of hell
aka, Denver International Airport
13I remember that my mom got me Whisper of the Heart cuz it's where the Baron originated but the plot was kind of stupid
Which is the third, I don't recall.

There were numbered ones in Dante's Inferno.
Yeah I know

6porko

The 1st ring is Philly international
LOL
JFK, LAX?
Never been to those
So I wouldn't know
Me either.
But the Durango Airport is pretty nice
Just throwing in suggestions.
Hehe
Miami.....there's the 4th ring
Five golden rings!
Bah
If they were gold, I'd eat my shoe
Aye.
Iceh.
Ahoy Icy
12Yes.

12What?
Were you now?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing to be SCARED of.
6lol
Unless you really are the 5th ring.
Oh, spekaing not being scared, did anyone bother to see the remake of Friday the 13th, which consisted of epic fail?
2 5th ring for what
*speaking
Good.

Ah.

Seeya.

6bye
How did he write all that so quick?
XDDD
12He's a cyber-ninja.
He says "I'm out" then two seconds later he's written a whole quit message
Does that automatically go on?
12You lost me.
Good.
I keep all the people in the dark.
12Like romantic comedies?
I think script.
It probably reads one randomly from a list of quotes he has.
There's a bloody and cut-up costume that a girl is wearing, and then Peter's like "So, what are you, one of Freddy Krueger's victims?" "No, actually, I'm an unborn child."
12Family Guy.

2i just really need a good song
"Oh, I'm guesing you never meant to kill those people,it was an accident, right?" "No, atually I simply delight in killing people."
*actually
2What are the mood of your vid?
2um...maybe a romance
"Letters from the Sky" - Civil Twilight
2where can i get that?
Look it up.
2actually no. how about a strokes song
You're justa dding it to a YT vid or soemthing right?
*just adding, something
2yep
7each other out. If it were, he'd just be a harvester)
neemy, lol.
shadow: Ty the oen I said
7...
7shush
7NO U >:u
k
dun wury gaiz it k
7Besides, you didn't respond to my rant thing.
7And stop talking like that.
i r gai who gun teech u lesun
Lol.
7HEZ FAT!
Admittance!
XD
2oh mah GAWD ITS GERLPY SEYRUPS
Guy not gay.
2innitttt
Fail.
7Is there a new episode yet?
2Of what, Family Guy?
That's how idiots spell gay.
No.
It ended.
I told you.
14LOL
7.... D:
14D:
My friend has seen every single episode.
Oo
/me 7goes to start and internet campaign drive. Those TOTALLY WORK.
LOL
2GOD DARI YOUR WELL STRAIGHT
Yes, yes I am.
/me straightens a parking meter.
How very observant of you DB.
2okay Video making time for real.
I've seen every episode too.
ButI've followed it since it began, so...
6I think I htg in a sec
2aww
2Dari: If people use the word gay as a derogatory term why cant gay people use straight as a derog. term? HUH
2YOU WHAT
You like A7x.
2Erm, yeah
2Only just realised?
2XD
i know why.
Nope, just wondering if anyone else realised.
14xD
The logo for A7x
2um...how the heck to i take audio out of a video so only the music plays?
6Ok,I /do/ htg
Arbiter: It's called Super Smash Brothers Brawl. And it's amazing. So shut up.
Chief: ur mom waz amasign l4st nite
2Bye C7
htg = hot to go?
Arbiter: Another mom joke? You just did one a minute ago!
14nuuu
14Bye c7
Chief: me adn ur mom did 1t a minit ag0
/me 14hugs C7
2LOLOLOL DARI
6*hugs_back*
6Yus Dari
Lol.
6Bye everyone
6O_O
Cya.
2Anyhow
2Er i am so confused.
It ended there, I'm pretty sure.
2How do i make audio in a video quiet.
2Windows movie maker. it's all i got
2arr
2So you have a videoclip on the timeliney thing?
Exactly, Chief doesn't even know how to put sentences together.
2I havent used WMM for ages, I cba XD
2yep
2Er Idk
But it sounds better.
2Dang it
Dari: So does your mom
My mum sounds better? Than what? Yours?
:P
Than last night.
2Lul
2Ha! i got it!
2I could hear them both from here, it gave me bad earache from her screeching
Well that would be because last night you heard me and your mum, all night long.
Holy mushrooms, Batman!
Sweeeeet.
2No mods....
2hohoho!
*four
2YOUR MUM
Sad face.
2i decided to use the smashing punkings. Cherub rock. It;s going swell
2Your mum's so fat when she walks backwards she has to say BEEP to warn the people she's reversing
2Smashing Pumpkins*
Punkings?
LOL
2FIAL
14O_O
2oh
2right
14WDF
14Fial xD
2Your mum's like a hoover. She sucks, she blows, then gets laid in the closet.
2HAHAHA
This vial contains a highly-infectious xenotoxin which once released will ravage the population and cut a jagged hole in history. I call it Fear.
2Fear = Swine flu v 2.0?
Nah.
Far worse than that.
Picture Raison Strain v2.0
2RAISINS?
Raison.
Ray-zone
2Your mum's armpits are so hairy it looks like she's got Bob Marley in a headlock/
XD
LOL
I prefer the Hoover one, but I lulz.
2I enjoyed the hoover one. i found that rather lolsome.
2Who wants...honey?
2Got some in the cupboard, ta
"I spilled honey all over my pants!"
2Ew, why does my hairband taste of chili con carne? Bizarreness
Nah.
...
Don't give me this window.
2Justin XD
I will ravage.
Fine, you've forced my hand.
Dari.
Lol.
2Forced it where now?
Xd
I was waiting for someone to pick up on that.
2Oh my bejesus
"So I'm now wearing dis... ridiculous ting... for you!"
"Are you on druuuuuuugs, Mr. Gambini?"
...
2Hey
2Hello there
Your name makes me think of a Urinating Ventricle.
LOL
2...
Lol, no, tis the name of a captain in the ultramarines chapter
Haha.
Kewl.
2It reminds me of a bizare mix of Ariel and Ursula off of the little mermaid and a heart.
2Different mindery eh wot!
Uesula has o do with a bear.
Xd
Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, clearly.
*Ursula
2Lol, Ursa
What the hell? Men in Black III? Noice.
2Your mum/
2You need a .com or .co.uk after the 'thatlink' anyhow, so NO
2?
I refuse our formalities
I'm gonna fly away now and help another young child. Seeya.
You actually going, or what?
Oo
/me asks who prince dari serves
2argh internet
2He went
...I've never really thought about that.
2I thought people served princes
2Or did I fail there?
/me activates his power sword and repeats his question
If I'm a Prince, then the King/Queen is above me.
So yeah, fail.
2I KNOW
/me 2runs
...
No.
/me 2comes back
2Really?
2Who DO you serve then?
2Who, Malefor?
BRB.
Space marines, ATTACK!!!
2Wait, no!
Dawn of war, great game
2Dawn of the dragon, hard game
2Cheesebus
2I'm off
2i made my video
2But i cannot uplaod it.
Tis cuz your faith is weak, just like your body!
2...
2what happened here?
14Indeedeo
14:D
2aw hes gone to?
2Now it's so lonely
2I spoke to soon
LIES
2Lies?
I dunno'
2are you on the plane?
Bah
I'm at my house in Colorado
2oh
2Well my video is gonna take forever to get going
Hmm....now that i'm stationary again, I'm gonna take some time to redo my setup
be back later~
7RAWR
7NO U >:U
2lol
13hi
13...:(
6Darii
6Hey
6Everyone is dead.. ;|
12Says you.
Hey.
13OK guys, sorry I keep asking, but I need opinions from people who haven't given me any yet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45sVM2amod0
6Can I tell you later?I can't put any sound on atm...D:
13:(
6Sry
Are catalytic cracking, and fraction distillation the same process?
Well, do they give the same result?
7You're asking this on the chat for a forum about a purple dragon.
One obviously uses catalysts, and the other doesn't.
Lol.
13I think he's quoting something
13unless you're talking to me
I'm not.
13XD
I'm arsking.
asking*
Or at least 16+'s.
13Google.
13:P
Ah, well I'll mention them both.
13Hey Gerp
13Can you give me an opinion from the video above?
Wow, only 993 words, yet I've got 4 pages, and it's in size 13 font. I'm good at making a little look like a lot.
There are 2 pictures, but they don't take up half a page each. :P
6Uhm sure! *Takes a look*
13JK
6Ugh..Why do I want peahes now that there aren't any?
6._.
Lol. Call RDX a nerd, he writes about 15,000 words at least per chapter in his stories.
got a problem with that?
Nope, just pointing something out. :P
13but Uncew helps me make towers wif my buiwding bwocks
6lol
6My personal favorite is Moments
13*hewps
4and I only went over 15,000 once
13lul
Whatever, it's around that.
13*towews
6And what?.. ;o
13....Does no one pay attention to what they say?
6Nope ^^
6I said;.. My personal favorite ; Moments
13you didn't say that
13:P
13thanks though
He did. :P
6:P
13Nah, I couldn't see through Dari's nerdness
13:P
13JK
:P
6LOL
6XD
6Towah of powah FTW ;]
Fine, but in a few years time, I get to call you a nerd.
13I don't care if you call me a nerd, I was joking anyways XD
/me drops into the channel, power armoured boots hitting the floor with a resounding thud
13Besides I'm the one that obsesses over videomaking
6UMG!
6O_O
6Is that captain planet?!?!!
13no
4lol
6Damn
6He's my Hewwroo ;3
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVzLzClY2E8< Captain PLANET!!
13The power is YOURS!
13It says it's not avaliable in my country
6Aww >.<
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVzLzClY2E8 now?
13No.
13It's the same thing
13it doesn't work
6>><
6>.<
6Go to YT, and search on Robot chicken captain planet
Someone explain the concept of an alkene, and alkanes to me.
13nnnnNO!
6O_O
Are alkenes complex carbon bonds?
6I've never even heard of them..>.<
Hm, wikipedia says that alkenes are carbon-carbon double bonds.
So I'm guessing that alkanes are simple molecules.
Lol.
Got a Rotom yet?
13no
The events ends during this month. :P
Tick Tock.
13*eyeroll*
6Wth is this "platinum" about?.. >.<
Pokemon Platinum.
13It's a pokemon game.
6Pokemon ;o
6Winn X]
6I have pokemon mystery dungeon red rescue team for GBA
6Ugh...brb
6I haz 3 go D;
6Bbl X[
6Bye...
6D:
7... Rotom?
7^sc^
It's motor backwards. Lol. They come up with such crappy names.
7spyrochat needs a Rotom. It'd be the SC-Rotom.
7:P
7Feh.
6Wtf
7I have a Platinum Rom. It's almost identical to diamond
I know, lol.
I wouldn't pay for it when I already have diamond.
After ruby, saphire, and playing emerald to find it being exactly the same.
13I pretty much collect pokemon things so I have Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum
I managed to glitch up the game, because I had an egg in the daycare place, but no pokemon in there. So when it hatched, it came up looking sort of like Missing No.
Then when you clicked on the pokemon bar, and your party came up, there was a question mark for one of the spots.
So you could only have 5 pokemon at a time.
7God. I loved Missingo.
It was weird.
7Missingno*

7Gunna go play with my bird mounts in Gmod nao.
Where's FB when you need him?
He'd probably know this stuff.
4I can get him lol
Doesn't matter, I think I've got it now.
Why is it there is always one failed log in attempt everytime I sign into this.
10I don't, I always do it seconds after I come in
BOO
13anyways
13I gotta work on some videos
13bbl
Also, what catalysts are used for catalytic cracking (specifically with crude oil).
10Simple Hydrocarbons are carbon chains with no branches. And usual catalysts for catalytic cracking are iron...at least I think so anywya
Iron is a catalyst? Oo
10Many different catalysts exist for different reactions. Platinum is used in catalytic converters in cars to reduce harmful emissions
One sec.
10chemistry involves a lot of catalysts
10Need any info on enzymes?
Nah, I'm good with that, thanks.
10Alright then
But are complex hydrocarbons alkenes?
You never really said, just you said that the simple ones have no branches.
10I wouldn't have thought so, an alkene is just missing two hydrogens, I wouldn't have thought that would make it complex
Because, according to wikipedia, after catalytic cracking, you are left with alkanes, and an alkene.
I would have though that the alkene then was the most complex hydrocarbon, that hasn't been broken down, because it uses it in the singular.
10Does it actually say you end up with one complex hydrocarbon?
Nope, just the you end up with some alkanes, and one alkene, that's why I was asking what an alkene is, I was just guessing.
that*
"In organic chemistry, an alkene, olefin, or olefine is an unsaturated chemical compound containing at least one carbon-to-carbon double bond" I don't understand the wiki explanation. :P
10Well yes, the chain breaks apart into different molecules, such as turning Decane into Pentane, propane and Ethene. The ethene would be the alkene because it's made with a double bonded carbon atom.
Does that mean that the ethene could be broken down more, or not?
10An unsaturated chemical compound means that the atoms that it contains haven't reacted with its maximum number of bonds
10The ethene couldn't be broken down anymore
10that would make methene which is too unstable
10Think of it like this, here's a diagram
10This is Pentane
Oo In what I've looked it, it says you get methane, propane, and butane.
10C-C-C-C-C
10This is Pentene
10C-C=C-C-C
10Each C atom has three H atoms attached to it on either end of the Chain
10The ones in the middle have two
Ok.
10Pentene However, has a double bonded C=C. So that means that the C atoms involved in that bond only have one H atom attached to them
Ok.
10Giving Pentane a Structure of C5H12, and Pentene, C5H10
Right.
10That makes Pentene more reactive than Pentane because it has that double bond that can have more compounds attached to it, like a carboxyl group or alcohol group
Ok.
10Have you tried looking at the wiki page of Hydrocarbons?
Nope, I'll do that now.
Is it possible to break down alkanes any more?
10Methane is the smallest one. You can only break down Alkanes into Alkanes if you provide it with Hydrogen at the same time
10Otherwise you get one alkane and one Alkene
What, so you can break down all akanes down to methane, if you provide them with hydrogen?
10Pretty much. Methane is CH4, so as long as you provide the reaction with H you would replace the H lost as the chain breaks into smaller components.
10What's all this for anyway?
Thing I need to write on oil.
10Is it an essay?
I've done fractional distillation, some I'm writing about catalytic cracking.
I suppose so.
10Is it for school?
Yeah.
10I see
10You done combustion yet?
Lol, nope.
10I'd do that one next, pretty simple to understand
I've done chemical properties, how it's made, how it's found, and fractional distillation.
10How it's used would be a logical next step. Then I'd focus on disadvantages and alternative methods
10Here, have you read this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_catalytic_cracking
Nope, I was just on the general catalytic cracking section.
10Well fluid would be the Crude Oil form, probably more specific to your needs
So having double bonds means it doesn't have as many H atoms, and that's why it's said to be 'unsaturated'?
10Exactly, you can break apart the double bond easily and add more compounds to it, such as another alkene
10http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/recycling-polymers/figures/long_hydrocarbon_sml.jpg
10look at that
What causes some of the molecules have double bonds though?
to have*
10Missing Hydrogen atoms, the C atoms need four electrons to be 'happy', so they share each others
So if they catalytic cracking takes place in hydrogen, you end up without any alkenes?
10I suppose so...but I'm just guessing at that bit, theoretically yes, it would, but in practice I don't know
Hm.
6Hey
2Hello
HOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10You've got me with my text books out now, I swore I'd never read them again, now look what you've done lol
Lol.
10Yes, that's right lol
Ok.
I think I've got it now, thanks. :)
10I didnt want to have to explain orbital shells to you :P
Hehe.
/me 10gets glomped
One last thing - iron causes the breaking down of hydrocarbons to accelerate?
10It should do if that's the catalyst. A catalyst provides a surface for the reaction to take place and lowers activation energies, so it should speed up the reaction
Ok, thanks.
2You guys talking about covalent/ionic boing?
2bonding*
2XDDDDDDD
12Audi.
...
2BMW
I've lost my enthusiasm for writing...
2Hey SM
I have the inspiration
Hi
2Are you sure? No more pron?! :(
2Hahaha
just no enthusiasm
10Giving up, shameful
Not giving up
...
just pissed off
2:/
10well that's pointless
I just don't have the patience to sit down and write
10Shouldnt be writing then should you
my freaking attention span rips me away from it
WRITING IS SOMETHING I LOVE TO DO DAMMIT!
i hate my mums laptop
2Someone once said to me 'never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about'. :/ It was confusing
10Then stop complaining and write
6BLOODY!!!
I love to write
2Write about new people!
...
no
2GORY!!!
2Anyhow
I just need something to get me fired up
...
My attention span prevents me from being enthusiastic about it
So you don't like writing?
10Just because you've hit a wall doesn't mean you've lost your entusiasm. Look at me, I've not wrote in about 2 months, doesnt mean I dont sit down almost every night and try
/me 4yawns
2Why do minstrels BURN?!!?
I HATE my mums laptop soo much
2I gathered that XD
I LOVE WRITING DARI!
6if u press the back key it sends u bac
So you ARE enthusiastic about writing then?
It does that to me sometimes SM
2He loves writin about Dari?
2writing*
Lol.
10I think the word he's looking for is motivation, not entusiasm
I just don't have the attention span to actually sit down and write!
2WANT MORE JUICE
Damn
Why was I using enthusiasm?
10Because you're a bit slow?
10:P
Its not an inspiration issue
Oh wait, same thing, I suppose.
I have the inspiration
6lol
6thanks
6i cant press teh back key otherwsie it goes
6:( stupid thing
6thats a big bloody bee
I'm just easily distracted by other things
2And I have more juice XD
10Only thing stopping me is writer's block
2Bees?! WHAT
6hang on brb getting a cu[p
2For my juice?
Mmm. Thirsty.
/me goes to get a pepsi.
2Mmm. Minstrels.
10Good man, drinking Pepsi
2Does epic music mean The Smiths?
2:D
No
10It's not a case of inspiration, rather a case of having other thingsa round me that are easier to do
It depends on the pursion
person*
6back
Damn
6whoa lagg
I hate it when that happens
10Well let's see, I have various chat channels, Halowars, books, and music. They are all much easier to do than writing and just eat up my time as if they were obese whales
2Obese whales?
10You know, fat overweight whales?
Whales cannot be overweight
2Well, yes, I know that but why?
they're the largest mammal on the planet.
10...it was supposed to be a metaphor. Whales eat tonnes of Krill a day, so I was, bah, forget it
10Its because there isnt enough H atoms to make the final alkane, causing an Alkene
10Just get a pencil and draw out a long chain and try to split them up into smaller molecules
But are there not enough H atoms, because the heat causes it to rise?
10you'll see what I mean
/me 2has been struck by a ... pole dancing pole
Oh.
10No, bevause there are only a certain number of H atoms
10Brb, hungry, going to get some quiche, if that's how you spell it
2My sister said division is worse than pie :/
2HIM
Let me edit that
2HIM>?????????QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ!!!!!!!!!
I created it for someone else
/alias fail :P
12Moob?
Moob= Man boob
10mmm quiche
Mmm, pepsi.
mmmmm Porn
10nothing beats quiche, end of
2Which kind of quiche?
2I used to think it was spelt kiesh
2:D
2nomnomnom
/me takes his porn back
10aww...my quiche is all gone now :(
7Can't you just kill him and be done with it?
10Where's the fun in that?
/me somehow brings his porn back, for he's written and made it himself, with the help of others.
10Bah, homemade porn
its the best kind
2Mmm, homemade porn XD
:)
10Should you children even be talking about porn?
HA!
I'm seventeen
10Ha, still under the 18 minimum
10And still a child
But, mine isn't normal porn, it doesn't involve humans
2...
10lol
Its Yiffy art.
and Yiffy stories
Furry art/stories
Pornography is any material (either pictures or words) that is sexually explicit.
Doesn't have to contain humans.
It's still porn.
Yes, that's true
10Could contain tetris blocks
^
But, still
Rock porn FTW!
its also art
Erotic art, but Art none the less
10Depends if its tasteful
Loads of art were done with nude models
how do you get a dynamic IP?
10Again, tasteful
Nude art is very common
10Because it's tasteful
One of my friends is just getting into the grove of that.
groove*
and starting to draw nude art
2Nude art is tasteful and formal whereas erotic art is playful and suggestive and ....erotic XD
"the display of a female ankle in Victorian times was regarded as most risqué"
10Pretty much
I have Erotic art
>.>
I may see if my friend would draw a nude picture of me
10And?
2:|
<.<
2My ankles are weird XD
12I'm scared.
10And I do believe this conversation has taken an awkward turning
/me 9turns the conversation
2I AINT GOT A FUCKIN PROBLEM
2I JUST LOVE TO SAY FUCK
2:D
2Sorry, had to do that
12Mmmm.
2:O is sorry
10I'm probably going to die tomorrow
Why, you run over someone?
/me 9is 42 years old, so the chocolate helps
10Nope, I'm gonna melt
LOL
10The shop I work in is like a fricken Sauna
30+ C?
9Mmhmm
10And tomorrow is supposed to be the hottest day of the year
10 32 C last time I heard
9Oh and my little sister (Adult) wants to discuss topics
2A 42 year old child?
9Yes
2I'm .......consufed.
2ok
4behaves :D
2behaves?
2ok
10Good boy for behaving
/me 2has behaves
4:O
9Good doggy
2Â¬_Â¬
9Sorry
10Bah
/me 4headdesks
9My sister said hi
10Bet that hurt
10Hi your sister
/me throws a desk at RDX's head.
4thank you
4I needed that
9She wants to have a political argument with you guys
10Fun
4wonderful
4I'm sure it would be absolutely thrilling
10He may be being sarcastic but I really do enjoy a good debate
9She's nine, btw
2LOL
10Oh, nevermind then :P
4Not really being sarcastic lol
9And doesn't know Obama'sd yuyhunjnhk
2...
4just would be since you have three heavy political debaters in here right now
9She leaned on the keyboard
10And they would be?
2I have everything against politics
9She doesn't know Obama's first name
DID SUM1 SAI OBAMA?
4lol
10Borat
2I love his accent.
2Bruno looks fun
9She said I don't know what a bird is (....)
10It does I suppose
10for some reason I'm messing with a tube of toothpaste
9Damn, gtg
10bye
2Toothpaste!
4BYE
2I used to eat Milk Teeth when I was about 4
10was supposed to put it in the bathroom, but left it on my bed so now im just fidgeting with it
See how many tubes of toothepaste you can eat before you die, lol.
10im sure I could get through at least a dozen
10maybe even a baker's dozen
Hm.
I wonder what the record is.
10then again, that would mean I would have eaten at least a litre of toothpaste
4Toothpaste tastes good
Wow that's a lot, lol.
10depends on the brand
10Baking soda toothpaste is just god damn aweful
2Never tried it
10tried it once, never again
2HA my sister's in my brother's high chair
2She's 12
10Cool, wish I had a high chair...
12Yay!
12Ok.
10You can sit above everyone then :P
10of course then you cant reach your food at the table if you're eating
That's like saying you want a lorry, because you can drive while sitting above everything else. :P
10Aw, cool, get me one, or a monster truck. I enjoy looking down at other road users
Lol.
10When Im on a bus or coach I used to wave at people to see if they waved back
10the majority did
10the rest either ignored me or simply stuck their finger's up
Lol.
2Ahh when we were going ice skating once on a school trip we waved at about 7 lorries and one kind spanish man waved back :D
10lol its always fun waving at strangers
10of course I simply looked at a boy on a tricycle once and he put his finger up. Gobsmacked me, he was only about 4
2WTF!
2hahaaa
Wow.
10I was flipped the bird by what was essentially a toddler
Nice to see how next generation's youth is turning out.
10yup
10he's probably all drugged up now, it was about two years ago
2Haaaa
LOL
2I MUST make sure Finley turns out to be a metalhead and not a chav
10Eugh, cant stand chavs
10Or rappers
10Or gangsters
10Or people that think they're cool because they follow a particular brand of music/singer
10but mostly rappers :D
2Currently everyone at my school is playing that black eyed peas one
10yeah, i hate kids at school, so full of themselves
The reason they have double bonds, and that there is only one alkene at the end of the process is as follows: <--- Should that be a colon, or a semi-colon
10colon, then a semi-colon every time you split the list
Ok. Thanks.
10your welcome

2Billy Mays is dead?!
12Yup.
People who had tickets to Michael Jackson's concerts can either get a full refund, or some holographic cards...Ooh, such a tough decision.
hmm, I am hoping they choose the cards
2I never knew about Billy Mays, lol

10Hi

6gtg
6Bye
10D:
Hm.
10Of course lol
Care to explain how plastic, and hydrocarbons are related?
10Plastics are made out of hydrocarbons
Yes, but what makes plastics have the properties they do?
And is it naphtha that is used for making plastic, or are other fractions used for making it too?
10Depends on the hydrocarbon's composition. For example, whether they contain Chlorine or not
10Plastics are usually long chains, more often than not poly chains
So, why do they have a high molecular weight?
10Yes, that's right. They have a high molecular weight because they can possibly contain hundreds of carbon and hydrogen atoms
Hm.
What are the main uses of oil, in general?
Plastic, fuel, what else?
10Lubricants
10I'll find a list in my text book, bear with me
Ok, thanks.
10Bah, can't find it. But I know aside from fuels bitumen is used for tarmacing roads, that's the thick liquid that sits at the bottom of a fractional distillastion chamber
So, they break down the crude oil, then make it into a huge molecule again? Oo
10No, the bitumen has too high a boiling point to be fractioned off, so it just sits at the bottom
I mean when they make polymers.
10Oh, yes, but they control it and make polymers with certain structures
Hm.
/me 13looks around
10I know something that might help you
10http://www.4college.co.uk/as/index.php here
Do they use naphtha as a base for plastic, or another fraction.
10go on it, click AS level
Ok, I'll read it.
LOL, AS level?
10yes, lol that's what you're getting out of me anyway
Well my chemistry teacher does get a bit ahead of himself. Lol.
Ok, thanks.
10If there's anything you dont understand feel free to ask. And try not to read anuything else lol you'll find out that your GCSE's basically lied to you and most of what you know is wrong in some form :P
LOL, ok.
/me 4headdesks X10000000
10Wow, that's a lot
4mhhhhhhhhhhhhmmm
10And what makes you headdesk to such an extreme?
4you don't want to know@.@
10That bad, eh?
10Stubbed your toe, didnt you
4hrh
6Goooooooooddddddddd mooooooorrrrrrrrrrniiiiiiiiiiiinggggggggggggggg
That reminds of a film.
6Which? ;o
About some guy who hosts a radio station in some country.
Can't the country, or the name of the film.
He always goes "Goooooooooooooooood morning, *Country*"
6Lol XD
Oh right, it's Afghanistan.
6Uhm.. liez
And the name of the film? "Good morning Afghanistan".
6LOL

On the final page.
6Isn't it Good morning vietnam?
Oh yeah.
6Can't find the one you said
That's it.
6Then I found it ;3
I thought that it sounded a bit off. Oo
6;o
6Well, Is it worth watching?
Good thing it was a short one, or I wouldn't have been able to do it in one day.
Dunno, can't remember what happened.

O_________o?
10Well I mean look at the picture where she's puffing her chest out.
10It makes me want to cry
...Why?
10Because it's so disturbingly big
oO
10Its just a chest
13hi
10oh, im back by the way
10lol congratulations. I think that's the easiest one to understand
:P
You turn back time and do AS level stuff at my age then. :P
10lol well I struggled with it now, so I dont have much chance then
6UMG
6Someone talked!
Lol.
6Well.. If I can conside you as somone ;o
10How charming
6Yey ^^
6I always feel ignored Dx
6And I'm fking bored atm
6No one to talk to, and need to learn a fking test..
10Are you, I'm very warm
10I get smeared everywhere, I'm blood

10THE blood
6Duh...
6CAPtAIN PLANNETT!]
10Randomness
6Nah.. I'm learning out of my fallen apart book..
10What are you learning?
6I was like; *Reads da book, and listens to the boring speech of the teacher.* Book; *Falls apart* Me: O_O UMG WTH?
6Biology
10What topic?
So if a higher octane rating = better performance, why is it that it says that octane rating is a measure of the resistance to engine knocking, which it says is good...?
13What's with people that continue to call 911 on McDonald's man
10Yes, a higher octane number gives better performence because it is resistant to knocking, which is when fuel ignites by itself
Oh, when it ignites by itself.
6o-o?..
10Yes
Knocking (also called knock, detonation, spark knock or pinging) in spark-ignition internal combustion engines occurs when combustion of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder starts off correctly in response to ignition by the spark plug
10Knocking is when the pressure in the tank causes autocombustion
^ When it explodes correctly it says... Oo
10Well that's wrong
Damn wikipedia!
10Knocking is something you dont want
10Knocking is what makes engines backfire
Oh, lol.
10Thats why crap fuel in your car is not preferred over high octane fuel. But really it only matters with top performence engines
Well it gets that right at least.
10Like a ferrari, you'd want high octane fuel in that to prevent damage to your engine
If I ever get my hands on a ferrari..
...*
10lol go for the high octane :P
The name's... Curiou Cosby.
*curious
Oo
13I just took that one quiz about "the fight against god" I last 1 second
Dinner already?
13Lmao
Aiceo: Lulz
My friend got 15 secs
On what...?
6Neoo ;o
It's a stupid quiz
Woot, done.
I count 6 pages.
I did everything logical thing right, yet I get an inferior score to some noob.
*every logical thing
6Gz Dari ^^
Although...
Maybe I can just round it up to the next thousand words.
6>.<
That's only another 82 words.
Dari: Add a bonus monolofue about the myraid uses of buttons
*monologue, myriad
Of course, we couldnt have oil without buttons.
6o-o
Prove it. :P
I will.
I see.
/me clears throat.

Wow, he's bested me, no way I can argue with that.
I found that cowboy again.
He wishes to rub sandpaper on his commy power.

You're all just jealous of VIKI's undeniable logic.
6Yep.. ;[

I'm growing tired of all this incessant chatter here.

Well, I'm gonna go
Thanks you, Captain Sparrow.
6Uhmm, Why?
But I must toodle away from here now.

12Yes
thats prop were i know you fromm then
12Yeh right
do you remember ross ammy and lurron
12You've probably been reading my journals.
Oh, I realised that of COURSE the blender changes, if you want money, the logic you might use is that, if they mention having lots of exspensive items, they are likely to be rich, if you want looks, the logic may be that if the person mentions owning lots of cosmetics, sounds vain, the way they talk about themselves, etc, that they could be good-looking, as an example.
12No I don't..
12I don't know anyone called Ross.. or Amy..
do you know a rob
Ok.
12Because right now I'm home alone
Ah.

ur names making me hungry
12I have a problem Ovo
6 8DDDDDDD
6o_O
6?
Although, I've heard some pretty terrible swine flu jokes at school.
02What's that Arti?
06?
12Well I had a guest over the other night for dinner and he kinda invited himself over tonight -v-
swine flu is cool
6O_O
12but I don't want to have any guets or cook any large meals, I just want to chill out or maybe go play DDR with Xai
6how'd THAT work out?
12Well
say by on him as soon as he comes
6just say you realized you can't have people over tonight
6pretend you're going out for dinner, then go to the arcade >XD
12He started off with "What are you doing Thursday?" I said nothing, he says "I should cook you something!!" then it was "No no, maybe I should cook something here! I'll bring stuff over!"
12>v>
12Lol
12That's lame, he'll say "Can I come" of course
6oh lol o_o
"This guy at my school got swine flu, poor-kid. The doctor said that there was-nout (sp?)he could do.
"
12He's done that before :>
06lol
6a fancy dinner for a couple?
12LOL!

12Lol, that'll look really rude
6play DDR in a dress XD
12He isnt stupid
6I know
6but I am >_>
/me 6splodes
lunch time
brb
6anyhoo
the only way out is to end it
!!!
6I don't know what to tell ya
13God I'm bored.
that you're going to enlist in the navy
right now
12Then do something.
Why is it that everyone makes a big deal about swine flu, they should try to cure regular flu, it kills so many more people.
becuase regular flue is boring
12We're not making a big deal out of it in this country Ovo
6lol
6it's toned down here
13Bored = nothing to do
don't they teach you kids anything at school any more!?
It's like bird flu.
12We just happened to be prepared for the worst here.
13either way I think I might go
13bye
14NOEZ
14D:
14T_T
6...
06It isn't so bad anymore here
02My mom said that the kid across the street got swine flu
6I need sims 3...-.-
olawd
12So what? XD
6see, a kid DIED around my area and we're not making a big deal out of it
12I probably had swime flu and didnt even realise it XD
02We weren't either
The only people that die really are either babies, elderly, or people with respiratory problems.
02I've heard some people go completely crazy over it, like one of my friend's friend's mom XD
06I think that four people died of it here in Wisconsin so far
14same Dx
6The cousin of a friend of my dad's says that there's too much to do and everything...you know keeping them happy and shit,that you don't have time for anything else...-.-
14o.o
6Cheats ftw
6>.<
Woo, torrents.
:P
ASTROchicken
06Ovo
6There's a cheat that gets you 50,000...
14._.
6o_IO
6hvulcx
Cheats may be fun for the first 10 minutes, but after that, you've completed the game, and will be exceedingly bored.
02chicken...now I'm hungry
14lol
6Yeah..I know..
6Though this game never ends...:D
6I've BEEN hungry
02I've been hungry, yet sick to my stomache
6And it'll take a long time for me to get bored of it..
14Until you become the Ultimate Sim :D
06This weather has been making me nervous and has been making me feel sick to my stomach
6XD
14xD
02Why, what's the weather there?
swine flu more like whine flu amirite?
06It's been looking like it's going to thunder and lighten for three days Ovo
06lighting*
I'd kill for weather like that.
the heat is good
you can warm things with it
Even here in England it's been 30+ deg C, for the last few days.
england
eww
yeah well
we totally own you >:(
/me salutes U.S. flag proudly
so what if I'm blonde
at least I'm pretty
06Shiny I like thunderstorms, but not when they're severe
I'm just saying I don't say it, because that's what I think of whenever I hear (or see) someone say it.
02My dad does Ovo
06So does mine XD
I'd rather freeze to death, than boil in the heat.
06When there was a tornado watch, he went outside to look Ovo
i dunno man
6I wonder what the expansions will be...
when it's COLD
14O:
you have to find a way to keep warm
02I remember goin to my neighbors (back when we had neighbors and no basement) I looked up at the sky and it was completely red
and it's harder to go outside and do things as a consequence
12I'd rather be hot personally, I find the cold unbearable.
When it's cold you can put more layers on, being hot, you cannot remove your skin, as much as you'd want to being stuck in a desert without water.
02The ice bird heats cold, and this fire bird hates heat...how did that work out?
12I actually dreaded ever doing anything over the last winter because it was nearly always minus numbers -v-
06But you're an Articuno Ovo
6LOL
6old jokes ftw
02wow
02i do not feel well
Cold doesn't bother me.
people always say that
but it's such a lie ;n;
It doesn't.
6I prefer the cold
06me too
you can prefer it possibly
6it bothers me when it gets too cold, but I prefer it over being uber hot
but of course it bothers you
Oo
12I HATED last Winter, I wanted to cry at times
What reason wuold I have to lie over the internet.
12Stop taking BF seriously
12He's British
becuase it's the only way you can find self-satisfaction
02o_O
LOL
!!!
12lol
12TRUTH REVEALED :o
6Do you um..remember any other Vanishing Card locations? >.<
I'm not blonde either
I'm ginger.
I worked that much out.
:P
*yawn* hello everyone
Hey.
14erm....
12Prince dari where about are you in the UK again? Norfolk or somewhere?
14Hmmm.......

02Hey L2X, so ya just woke up too?
LOL
14I can't remeber the one for that bathroom place
14but i swear i got that one
6:O
12XD
South-West. About 20-30 miles west of London.
yeah
12Ahh, Surrey?
12Or reading?
Reading.
12Ahh
12That's totally south east by the way
Oo
6I hate the things that keep shouting you...-.-
i dodnt go to bed till 7 ib the morning @Shiny
we must cleanse this land of the despicable southerner
brb genocidan
12the South West is generally anything past Hampshire
It's more in the middle.
:P
14whut?
if it's not *north* it's south
Ok, from now on, I'll call it South.
6Those things..I think they're called Erklings..
good boy
12Mmm yeh but it's considered east, there's no middle when referring to England other than "The Midlands" which is all a bunch of crap
6The stick ones..
Central South.
12XD
Lol.
02XD
12Leeds is dead center too but we're considered the North-east
Oo
west coast > east coast
we have less foreigners
12:( you have more ran though
12*RAIJN
12*RAIJN
12*RAIN
12SKROdy'df
Lol.
12use
12jhh
6And you make their heads pumpkins or something too...
YES
06XD
leeds is to the east of the pennines and therefore in the north-east
so thar
12Lol!Q
12Hi
12-Q
HIQU
14OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:
then*
02IQ?
12LOL!!!!
12Not this again!
14them things that play their sticks like a flute
14OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:
06?
14I hate the too xD
14them*
I do like pies. A lot of pies at one time.
6XD
oO
12Just because we don't like non-working foreigners stealing our taxes doesn't mean we want them killed
I do like cheese. A lot of cheese at one time.
*falls asleep on keyboard*
6Salamaders are kinda annoying too...>.<
14Salamanders are fun to play with :D
6Lol
With a survey they worked out that most BMP supporters are poor, badly educated, white, and male.
12had any cheese toasties lately?
14Especially when they blow up like a balloon.
in fact, the frequency at which I eat pies is 2.34567^10^246787654 Hz
12So you mean chavs, prince dari
i had one a few days ago
so becuase I eat pies
lols
LOL
I CLEARLY support BNP
6yeah
Yes, I suppose so. XD
since they like pies as well
the bitmap party?
12Then that explains why so many people from Bradford support the BNP
Bring Numerous Pies Party
gigidy?
BNPP really
but whatever
12It's riddled with chavs and foreigners that don't work
What about the Monster Raving Loony party?
bradford is NICE
12-v-
6But the thing that you have to put out the fire and stuff but then the salamander re-ignites it and everything...
12lol whatever Andrew XD
i went there yesterday and it was nice and sunny
14oh yeah
12LOL!
12yeh and thats it
14that's annoying
there's as much chance of me voting for the MRLP as there is the average person voting for Lib Dem
14and then MORE come
6I know!
12XD
Lol.
though the concentration of chav-wannabe-gangstas is above average
02brb
12I'm lost nowadays, no party is any good to me :/
6Skrewts are just hard though..
form your own
12I friggin hate Bradford
12and no way BF
6They have that stupid armor and stuff..
12Xai really wants to though

I'm a member of the baby-eating party
12-v-
and the BNPP
14you can only attack them from behind Dx
6I know..D:
14and
12Oh yeh
also, i agree with Articuno
14they blast fire from there D:
all the parties suck

02Better late than never?
6ya...
My bedroom is 32 degrees :(
6but I don't like being late >_>
02I procrastinate too much >.> <.<
12MOOREHEN!
12Aurora
12I still have the guest problem :/
12I dunno what to do.. Xai's not gonna be back till 7.30 or 8 maybe..
6what time is it now?
02Lock the door and pretend no one is home?
6and what time is the guest coming?
126.50
12Erm, 7.30 or something >v<
guest problem?
6hmmm
12Yeh Quil, someone we know sorta invited themselves round :/
what do you mean?
6well, what I would do is just go with it, and if he shows up, the ok...just have him over for tonight. Then tomorrow spend the night with xai doing something nice
12Kinda hard to explain but we had a guest over for dinner on Tuesday and he basically invited himself back for dinner tonight, it didn't really hit till today though because I just want a relaxing night with Xai and no one else
6and if your guest invites himself again, just politely say perhaps that wouldn't be a good time
12Blah Aurora, I just don't want the company tonight
6I know >_<
10They invited themselves? lol
12yeh
10that doesn't seem right
the hell
6the other option is going down to his place and telling him >_>
12It's very hard to explain
you should tell him you aren't free tonight
12Can't..
6quil, I tried that option lol
12I'll try and explain
02Lol
6she already said she's free
12What happened was he was like "what are you doing Thursday?" and I said nothing so he first offered to make dinner for me and Xai at his place, then all of a sudden he changed his mind and said "I'll bring stuff over here and we can cook together!" and we were like ...
12Didn't exactly know what to say..
10....ahh
7Testing, 1, 2, 3:
12Thats crafty huh? Asking someone in they're free before you say what you want to do :>
/me 7blinks
7DAAAAAAANG.
7And I just thought I almost got rid of the lag. D:
can't you say you wanted some time alone?
12Ok the other problem is..it's his last night in England -v-
12So we also feel REALLY bad for not seeing him tonight..
02Well, it's kind of like my dad askin me what I'm doin and I say "Nothing" but that truly doesn't mean I'm not doin anything
10oh..
10AERO
mm.. :/
10hi
hi Aero
Hai pplz~
well when's the next night you'll have to yourselves?
No school tomorrow, so I'm going to Thorpe Park. :)
02Hiya Aero, and Arti, you mean your guest?
12It's not really about wanting time to ourselves, it's more that I just don't want anyone else's company
6yeah....
12I'm not in teh mood to start cooking large meals for people and entertaining them all night
6hmm
6well, you've got two options, so I don't know what to say
6but maybe there's a chance he'll decide not to show up?
who exactly is it who's coming over? :|
Tell him your mother has become very ill, and you're visiting her in hospital. :P
6after all, has he called to confirm or anything?
10LOL
He can't say "Oh, can I come?" to that.
:P
12No, he said he'd email and to confirm what dinner we'll cook.. this morning there was no email and I can't check it now because it's on Xai's account
12Prince he knows my mum lives in Devon lol
12and it's no one from TST
12It's just someone local
Hmm...
mm.

7'E. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe, acute bloody diarrhoea (although non-bloody diarrhoea is also possible) and abdominal cramps. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. It can also be asymptomatic.'

12Aww sweet
Hey Quil

Mind if I PM you?
6That would be awesome!

and yeah Ika?
Can I PM you?
oh. go ahead
12Oh my god phew, Xai just said "I'm really tired, just back from work.." and he took it fine XD
I just read an article regarding to 'outside' as a video game. lol
?
http://www.pressthebuttons.com/2008/03/outside-is-over.html?cid=109265958
is anyone reading this?
6lol
http://www.holdthebutton.com/
:D
right click, go to sleep, high score
12Im reading
lols
read the comments too
I know Quil XD
6wait...
6wtf o_O
12Is that a joke or is there really a game like that?
.. lol
go outside and find out :P
12Or are they playing on the word?
12....LOL
12Ok ok word play, I get it
but they totally make you believe its a game. even all the comments go along with it
12I know
12It's awesome XD
6"M biggest disappointment with Outside is having to actually deal with the consequences of my actions. Seriously, I jumped on the guys head. I beat him, I should be able to progress, but no, I'm stopped. That is a major programming error, or at the very least a serious lack of foresight."
6LMAO
6this is the best wordplay ever
XDXDXD
XD
6But mostly Outside, regardless of its audio and visual qualities, could use some serious fixes.
6I could read this all day XDDDDD
hi Xeli
6g00n! read that link!
10hi
one problem i have with outside is once you reach a certain level (it's different for everyone) your account is terminated.
10which link?
6http://www.pressthebuttons.com/2008/03/outside-is-over.html?cid=109265958
10wut
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=170351743691 <-- lol, can't belive they think someone would buy it XD
it are awesome. read it.
"My character seems to get a lot of lag in the morning, but it seems to clear up when I use the caffine powerup. Is this a bug? I've tried contacting the creators, Global Omnipresent Development (GOD for short) through the prayer support system, but I haven't got a clear reply as of yet."
XD
10just wow
7'I'm not really a big fan of Outside. I only play it because it's the only game that I'm better at than South Korean 12-year-olds.'
XDDD

I saw that one too. XD

A conspiracy is afoot! D:

1001 is 4 in binary, so it's 4 things to do with binary, lol.
its all a zionist conspiracy

that's better
hi Altair
hei
10hi
02Hiya Altair
wb
thanks
although I can see someone saying something like "pit = home"
hi all
ALTAIR
which I can assure you is not the case
10good :o:
ANTH
we do have a pit though
we throw people into it when they don't pay their money on time
pip pip
10dramatically i presume.
Normally, do you do any AS level work during Year 9 at school?
probably not
Oo
depends on the course
some are really easy anyway :V
Someone told me that what I'm doing is AS level chemistry.
the first part of AS level is just a repeat of GCSE
bahaha
7BLAH, did Aurora leave?
that's quite easy
AS = GCSE chemistry?
not mine
I mean
7And yes, Feather?
AS = A level, I think.
we compare A-Level chemistry to GCSE chemistry
i.e. atomic levels
but it's not the same
6im here
10it's cute
7Rora, finsihed the Doduo line.
tbh I doubt yr9 work is AS level chemistry
possibly
idunno
what work exactly?
It was about catalytic cracking/reforming, stuff about alkanes, and alkenes, among other stuff.
oh
hmm
Polymers, plastics.
well
bloated, I mean it's quite easy to make people think they're really good by showing them AS level maths from the first part of the course, which is just a recap of GCSE-level stuff
which is easy
organic chemistry is easy anyway :V
and ah, @ Horo
well, organic chemistry at AS is uuh
well
6quan, pm?
really, what alkanes and alkenes are should be common knowledge anyway >:(
6show me
:P
dunno about polymers and plastics either
we didn't do those at AS, other than an example of why organic compounds are sexy
Lol.
we did things like reaction mechanisms
oww my skin it burns '-'
Oh well, having learnt most of the GCSE course now, next year shouldn't be too hard, right?
which involve lots of curly arrows
sun burn nick?
yup
chemistry is a piece of wee-wee at GCSE
it's like
the hardest thing is
n = cv
or something ridiculous
Lol.
6lol
tl;dr
I've already got one GCSE in the bag, really.
do *not* take chemistry at AS
if
you're only taking it becuase you got good results at GCSE
i dont have to take chem :D
well, you could take it for that reason
apparently physics took the place
Well, it's a long time before I have to make that decision.
if you're particularly smart
physics and chemistry are sexy together
on their own they're boring ;n;
our chem teacher flunks people for yhe hell of it
*the
Biology and physics do not miz well -_-
lolyes
biology is a hobby
not a real science
:(
tis a real science, chemestry is a hobby
/me runs
chemistry is useful
for what?
Biology is like more in-depth Geography.
Biology is needed for medical stuff
for making everything you can think of on a scale that allows everybody to get stuff cheaply
7Oh god.
including medicine
7Grevious16 is still here?
and anasthetics
We wouldn't have any plastic without chemistry. :P
we wouldn't have most things without chemistry
!!!
7" 33 days and counting on when my banner will be done. Has Taco Godess left the forum or does she have more important things to do. 33 DAYS I've waited! Hm, maybe she doesn't do banners anymore. But just to be sure, I am going to reply on this topic everyday until my banner is done. Laugh Won't that be fun?" What a dickmunch.
we wouldn't have medical knoledge without biology...it is biolkogy
really
*Biology
yah rly
most of that knowledge is useless without chemistry
i wouldnt have my sanity if i had have taken it :(
?
since somebody has to know how to produce everything that medicine-related stuff needs
We wouldn't have biology without chemistry
Yeah, you'd know what the problem with someone was, but you couldn't cure it.
we wouldn't have chemistry without physics
^5 Horo
we wouldn't have physics without mathematics
Biology and chemestry cannot exist without each other BF, case closed
End of.
but chemical physics
is like
and hi guest
awesome
chemistry can exist without biology
physics is anoying enough already, don't chuck chemestry into it D:
bio sucks imo
it was boring
Physics is awesome
Physics is likes maths, it all makes sense, there is only one logical answer. :P
not rly dari
Yeah, really.
my physics teacher was like 25.
>.>
well, yes... but its more complex than most maths
Considering that all physics is based on maths, not really.
one of our teachers had a phd but sucked at teaching
I challenge you to calculate the net gravitational pull on the earth from all other objects in the solar system at its perihelion this year with relativistic gravity
mmm
i think you can do that
lolno
using
/me stops argueing cause he knows he usually looses
and maths is far more complex than physics (at least classical physics that is)
something like
a metric tensow
*sor
but I forget the name of the theory
Quantum physics is another matter. Especially when you combine it with computers
it's not superstring, and that's the only theory other than general relativity and quantum that I can remember the name of :(
/me hugs the imaginary kilobyte
fyi: ten dimensional metric tensor was discovered in 1850's
O_o
I think you probably mean proposed
mmm
ten dimensiona.....never mind, wouldn't understand -_-
check the Riemann tensor
and proposed, probably
board
becuase you can't verify it
or maybe you can
as IMHO there's no way something actually believed before general and special relativity is accurate now
idk
hmm
thing i
s
well then
bbl, gonna have a shower
ten dimensional theory is part of superstring theory
damnit D:
which as far as anyone knows, is the most accurate so far
fail2u
XD
but there's more than ten dimensions
>:
hmm
/me prods the 11th dimension
theoretically
I'm trying to remember stuff I've read
I remember the number 26 from somewhere
but I think it all boils down to ten or something
How the hell do you calculate the number of dimensions there are? O_o
magic
beats me
there will be a way, obviously
According to Arthur C. Clarke, it's magic for you
Definition of a dimension is?
i don't know
Good question
can anyone define a dimension?
Time is a dimension
length is a dimenion
*dimension
so how can you link length and time?
Well doesn't that mean you could say there are an infinite number of dimensions...?
no
there are for dimensions we can empirically verify
why would there be an infinite number of dimensions?
but all the maths done so far suggests a finite number of dimensions
I don't know, what makes length, and time, dimensions.
becuase an infinite number doesn't make sense really... :S
iirc there could be an infinite number of universes, if that's what you're thinking of
thanks to vacuum energy that would then mean that even if most of those dimensions had theoretically zero length there would be infinite volume in the universe and so infinite energy
ooh
I remember that
In the real universe, there are only real numbers. Which are numbers ranging between zero and infinity minus one
whole numbers only
vacuum energy is close to 0
ergo, there cannot be an infinity
but apparently not 0
Indeed
virtual particles are fun
hmhm
/me hoardes gravitons
hey
which means the speed of light in a vacuum is actually SLIGHTLY LESS THAN c
hihi
hmm cool.
Plus, it also means you can change c.
howzat?
What is the standardised speed of light, in air?
IIRC in water it's ~.75 c
i must have paid no attention in physics, i hardly know any of this
in copper, ~0.6c
air, dunno
What is light travelling in at speed c?
pretty fast.
a true vacuum of energy zero
10i can recall hearing some observations speaking for a higher value of c earlier in the universe...
3*10^8 m/s iirc
10or well, higher, then a bit lower, and today ^
*m/s^1
wat
How do you create a vacuum of energy 0?
Sounds right, BF.
also i go now
10bye alt
bye
I like the idea of the universe having a wave function
See ya, Altair!
o//
Xel, you sounds like you're refering to the possible variation in the fine structure constant.
cyas~
Evidence is iffy. Current instruments arn't good enough to say conclusively either way.
How do you know what the speed of light is in a vacuum of energy 0, when we can't create such a thing?
this chat makes me @_@ anyway
Well, how is it worked out in theory?
maths
Maxwell calculated it.
bringing two perfectly smooth plates together (a distance measured in microns to be accurate) may allow you to increase c by one in several million parts
10Yeah, but it's a theory that might be right, and certain things speak for it.
I have no idea how to understand his equasions. They look calculusy.
10But then again, no theory can be 100% sure... only damn close
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light <-- pic on right points out that the light's in a vacuum and only at 0.9997c
I was thinking, that when you move your finger, for example, doesn't that create a vacuum? It's just that as there is no air tight seal, the air replaces the volume of your finger really quickly?
well really
So doesn't that mean that air is kind of 'following' you, when you move?
I suppose there's lots of vacuum
It would crate a very slight reduction in pressure, that's all.
even within atoms
If you move your finger really fast, you'll notice the reduction in pressure propigate it's energy out as sound.
all fields reduce a photon's velocity which is what causes light to move slowly through a medium
If this is all true, what is the air-speed velocity of an unlaiden swollow?
33.6 m/s
what kind of swallow?
African
A while ago, when we were taught about energy, they told about the normal types, heat, electrical, sound, kinetic, gravitational potential, etc, but they didn't mention vacuum energy, is that one of the types of energy?
6LOL
There are only two types of energy.
6I actually know that quote
10o_O
Kinetic and potential.
Oo
10in use and "can be used" lol
10stored and beeing used
vacuum energy is a form of potential energy
Ah.
Heat being the 'vibration' of atoms, so it's kinetic, for example?
right.
same idea for sounds
10Airwaves but sort of.
Two types of energy, four types of force.
electrical is a combination of the two; electrons move (KE) and their electromagnetic fields (PE) make stuff happen
Hm.
btw if you really must know the bird's air-speed velocity if it is european, here is the link to the math --> http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/
Does anyone know why vacuums happen?
becuase there's nothing there
But why does there have to be something there?
particles must be evenly distributed
causing a vacume
yay fail spelling
It's the same concept as water across a semi-permiable membrane.
no, vacuums occur because particles aren't evenly distributed
It must always be balanced.
particles gather around points of high-gravity leaving less elsewhere
And if you're a priest you can survive the blast of anti-matter. :D
And what exactly is light? Is it a byproduct of heat?
/me had Angels and Demons randomly pop into his head.
Light is both a particle and a wave
Why does it take extremely strong gravity to affect it?
(Black hole)
And anyone can survive an anti-matter explosion in theory. just not being hit by the actual antimatter
PET scanner
any gravity affects it
But light is pulled into black holes, it isn't to Earth is it?
the general theory of relativity was proven when Eddington showed that light is bent by the sun using a photograph taken during an eclipse
/me is on summer break and all this science is making his head hurt. He decides to wait for a certain bird in silence.
black hole has much greater gravity than the earth
so it's noticeably affecting light
Hm.
10That's why it's black.
a black hole must be at least around three times the mass of the sun to exist, and the "visible" part of a black hole is much smaller than any significant object in this solar system
10No reflection.
mmm
i once read that black holes are ring-shaped
cool (y)
But why does it take such a strong gravitational pull to create a noticeable affect on light, where as most other things are noticebly affected with much weaker pulls.
you sure that's not just the accretion disk you're thinking of?
becuase light is fast
because light is travelling at the speed of light
10Some people say some black hole's singularities are ring shaped, but even that is controversial since it involves infinity. @ BF
10and people appearently don't like infinity
if you were travelling at the speed of light, ignoring all problematic consequences, gravity would have the same affect on you as on light
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1iJXOUMJpg <--- how you'd die in a black hole :D
10lol

One teacher told me that fire falls under the state of matter plasma.
Hadn't heard about plasma before that, anyone know of any other examples of plasma?
plasma isn't really a state of matter
it's just ionized gas
10Parts of fire is the only plasma on earth i've heard.
So fire is ionized gas, which is why 'ionic wind' (something like that) affects it?
10and people call it a state of matter because most of the universe (the "Normal" matter already like 4% of it) = plasma
I also asked one teacher what makes an apple for example red, not in the sense that it reflects red light, and absorbs the other light, but what I am asking is what makes an apple reflect red, why doesn't it reflect blue, for example? He gave me some confusing answer about atoms, and told me it was above A-Level, lol.
10lol
You were effectively asking what determines where it's absorbtion bands lie.
I'm not sure of that myself, but I know it depends on the interactions between atoms.
Which is why molecules may have colors different from any of their constituent elements.
back
Hm.
Why can light going through a lens magnify what you see? What happens to the light to make the image bigger?
the wavelength of light is smaller than the size of your hpotoreceptors in your eye, it justt spreas them out more
i think
, well it certainly refracs the light a little
Ok.
wb
thank you
10mhm bye all for now :)

wb?
/me coughs
/me hands nick a strepsil
02In a sense, I guess you can say. I couldn't join whatever you were chattin about, so I just left and went back to the c-box XD
Im sunburnt and I have a cough :(
I don't see why anyone would WANT to be famous. Oo
As an ambition, or something.
/me hands nick som after-sun aswell
02Aws, that sucks Nick. I hate sunburns (which is why I do almost everythin at night)
lol
but today was so nice I had to sit out
its only when its night that the burns kick in
02If it was nice out here (which it is sometimes) I would sit in the shade, regardless :P

7What happened? o3o
12yeh but unforutnately I left my ID at home while we were on our way to the station (last train there) so I had to RUN all the way back and then all the way to the station while Xai went ahead, amazingly I got there just as he did
12But yeh I ran a mile non stop pretty much
what was your time?
/me runs
10I'm not in the mood to talk about it..
12over did it, legs cramped up and couldn't play properly, now I feel very unwell
7Talking makes everything better.
Arti, were you running a mile on flat ground, or was it hill...y...? o_O;
/me petpets Arti before she goes
ID? What did you need ID for?
6train ID
6probably?
12they require ID after 9pm, no under 18's
6iunno XD
12@ the place we ddr in
6ah
12But it's not like a gentle run, I ran like hell to try and get to the station in time
hope you feel better tomorow D:
6it should wear off by morning
6afternoon at latest
did that one guy ever show up?
/me hugs him....
10tightly....
what? they require ID for travel now?!
6nick, the arcade place
/me 6floofyhugs Feather...
12No no the place I was ddring at I said lol
12The Xscape place, they close it off to under 18s at 9pm
6it's NOT an arcade?
12No there's an arcade in it
oh
6ooh
6that's cool
12hang on
12http://www.xscape.co.uk/snow/castleford/
12it's where I want to hold the official TST meet
hey Arti, did that guest not show up?
12the big one
12No he didn't :>
oh yay
12Good thing because we decided to go play DDR in the end lol
lol
and uh.. when IS the meet?
6DUDE
12Not till next Summer now
ah cool
6snow zone, rock climbing, DDR, arcade, bowling, laser arcade
6...
6HOLYCRUD
6we need one of those out here
lol
is there gonna be like.. group traveling or will we all arrange seperately?

o_O;
what about flying over? :|
what site?
12That'll have to be seperate unless you can organise it with other TSTers yourself
02google
ok
6I doubt I'll be going
6in fact, it'll be a miracle if I can go
02It didn't respond and boom, everything was restarted
12blah
7That's like the dA tour without Spyed/Heidi. :P
12in other news, I'll mention it again, TST hosting runs out tomorrow if anyone is able to donate, we'd be like so totally grateful D:
hosting for what?
6wait what!!!!
6already?
6there's no news about it on the main page :O
12I know
12I forgot about it -v-
02I have no idea what's goin on, but I'll listen
12But I wpouldnt have asked for donations on there anyway
12I'm already sad about asking here
6you did last time lol
12Yeh, and I didn't want to :>
6ah XD
ehh. how much are you down by?
Arti b4 you go, PM?
12The thing is we can pay for it, it'll just be difficult.
6well even though you hate to do it, it may be your only choice
12So any donations at all will be accepted, but it's not REALLY important like last year when I literally had nothing
6there's thousands of people there
6oh
12It's kinda late now
12Ok Nick!
Arty
Link me to the donations page :p
Articuno, I'm not going to give you money, but how is your commission queue now?
12Im not doing commissions for it, donations only :>
Ok.
k
how much is it about in total though?
12A whopping $376 -v-
12Or so
O.O
12Which is probably why I forgot, I didn't want to think about it LOL
Well, you can have my last 5
12Hey look, even $2 is worth something to me
Cause...thats all I have <_<;
/me gives cause he likes burds
12No way Im not taking all your money!
Arti
/me needs to buy another prepaid, thats the money he has on THIS one
12Ok the donate box thingy is up on the right hand side of the site now

02the pokemon video games need to make an item
02where it lowers the pokemon's level
I calls it Null Stone.
02o-O
Devolves the pokÃ©mon and reverts it to level five. The Null Stone is then keyed to that pokÃ©mon, and when used again, it will disintegrate, returning the pokÃ©mon to its previous level and evolution, all changes to EVs and such remaining.
if you use EV- berries do your stats go down?
02yes
02or else people would just use ev- berries
/me plays Final Fantasy VII on her PSP
yeah, thats why I was wondering

12Do you play Guitar Hero?

02O.o
02No
02XD
12....
12Not you..
I have GH3 on wii but no
02i think gh is rather boring lol
12Ahh right I wondered because I tried it the other day for the first time and quite enjoyed it
12I think it's a good multiplayer game
02o.o
02XD
12Not as good as DDR of course :D
what's Microsoft's policy for what they'll do about a RRoD?
02DRAKE
12XDD
/me huggles
/me huggles
02lol
02And yeah
04Check out my sig and avatar
02If I don't reply
02It means my mum's around
04Yeah, i know
12I don't know, but to program the RRoD they must have known about certain errors.. so why didn;t they fix those?
12and yay rain
12Lotsa rain!
02they were probably being rushed on the project
02XD
04RIKU
02I know
they were fully aware that it MIGHT happen from the start
it MIGHT happen to any electronic thing
they put in the RRoD so that if it ever happened they'd know that's what the problem is
02lolXEMNAS
12No I thought certain things triggered the RRoD, hence why it happens to brand new ones all the time too
12But yeh ok
12I see what you're saying
12But in that case, why haven't they done anything about it?
12Why is the RRoD unfixable?
02microsoft
02like the color red
02*likes
04???I dun get it...
12It should have been blue if you ask me!
02nah
02red is more of an evil color
12LOL!
02fits microsoft perfectly
02lol
They're making improvements supposedly, even if from what I've heard consoles are meant to fail far earlier than this thing has
02XD
It says nothing about the cause of the fault.
12Yeh I got that
Consoles are not designed to be fixed.
12Well if it's a software problem, I dont see why not when we have Wifi nowadays
04What are we talking about?
12Read up
/me feels left out and confused
04brb
it's a general hardware failure
that's why it has to be sent in
04back
apparently we've had it for around about two years (thought it was longer, since it's one of the originals), meaning we ARE covered by the extended warranty
so now to find out what we actually do
02XD

Because the bus drivers aren't allowed to turn the heating off. :P

45 C translates to what in Fahrenhit?
I'm not sure how to caculate it.

Around the temperature in Dubai.

I don't ride any buses except the school bus to school.

12Speaking of cycling, I might buy a bike
can you ride it?
12No I can't D;
....
07Whee
hmm
that is so dumb
do they have lessons in Leeds?
12But I want it to look pretty in my flat
Why would she buy it
12Yeh they're about £50 an hour though
if she cant ride
hai Hawkeh
12Because it'll look pretty in my flat
12:DDDDDDD
who needs a bike when you have flocks of seagulls?
gawsh
LOL
learning to ride a bike is easy
it's not HARD
TAKE ME TO LONDON.
12XD
12EW NO
*Tips bread*
find the average thrust of a seagul and you've done the bloody hard part
7You can't ride a bike huh Arti
12I was just joking!! XD
12Of course I can!
lol.
07I cant
07>.>
aww.
07Im not allowed to
07am a hazard for myself and others
/me can cycle 33 km/h for 2h \o\
12That's a bit different :>
07LOL yeh
07But I still cat
find a large, flat area, and start by ignoring the pedals, just put your feet on the ground and push off, see how far you can keep balance before you need to use your feet. Once you've got the hang of balance adding pedals is easy
07*cant
7Since I pretty much can't drive, I'm stuck with no license
12LOL HORO, I never learned that way
7I do my traveling on bike
12I remember my friends and my sister just pushing the bike and me peddaling and crashing multiple times XD
hey, it's the way I learned, and my sister learned the same way at way younger than most people learn
07LOL I did that too Arti!!!
lol/
12^v^
/me did...not
Horo
7Not here unfortunately, there is no trains I can use like Arti for example
OKAY.
no such thing as flat where I live
07arf
becuase I'm HARD
WHO LIVES CLOSE TO PHILADELPHIA?
a level street will do fine
HULLO BIG BAHOOKEY FOX.
you just want to be on concrete or something flat-ish that isn't at a major incline
^
|
|
12Gosh.. good bikes are expensive, never really knew just how expensive they were
Craigslist :/
7How much are they, good ones are $200 here
I sold 3 bikes for $70
Never know
12About £150-200
12But I was hoping I could get a good second hand one for £50-70
yeah.
No
Two were.
12Oh well, if we sell the car we'll buy bikes
One wasnt
sell your car for gas money
And use that to buy seagull feed
^^
7You're lucky you live in a smell country Arti, your travel options are very accessible unlike the US
7OMG, Small*
12LOL!!!!!
England Smells?
7I hate the E key now
/me had thoughts it did...
/me wonders if she could bike ride down some back-roads all the way to Devon XD
12It does, in places like Birmingham :>
XD
7Like I said to you earlier, those without a driver's license are looked down upon
12I mean how many of the older members here have cars? XD
12From England
CP
12RN and Andrew and that's all I know so far
Its easy
/me 7wants to live in England now. D:
Just slide the guy $100 XD
12It'd be a step up from Detroit >v>
hi arti
....how do you know about that?
7I don't live in Detriot, just near it
CP
7'Cause Detroit sucks
12Yeh same as DRF
I'm sorry about the Lions.
12But it's still Detroit to me LO
12*:O
7Eh?
07lol
even kyu knows
o.o;
7Oh no, I mean stuff like pretty much the founder of the city is bankrupt due to economy
oh
And Kwame?
7I was laid off few times, the economy is critical here
Meh, sucks here to.
You guys got it worse, though.
People keep moving down here >_>;
10ohgod
7That's pretty in detail
very nice
7Arti didn't I tell you a fox was found by my family a couple months ago?
12Ovo no
7I forgot what kind of fox it was, it was hiding in the ditch with a broken leg, seemed pretty young too
awww
7When I arrived, I attempted to get near it, big mistake
12Eep
7Getting near a cornered animal is always a big mistake
12brb
lunged?
7Yes, it growled too
o.o
7It didn't reach me due to it's injury
7I really wish I could help it
7Animal Control hopefully came and took care of it
Aww
12back
12I'm really surprised to hear that!
12What first got you into birds>?
7Ah, well, I have always been into birds
7But how I became mesmerized by them was a very disturbing story
12LOL oh come on
i got in to birds in falconry
12I want to know now!
/me does too kinda
You got me with disturbing
12Same XD
Oh no.
7I was practicing stances and range by shooting at an ahead target in the woods
12Uh oh
7I was looking through the scope when I was startled by a red flash zooming past my sight which led me to firing the weapon
Cardinal?
7A cardinal of all birds got in my line of sight, but don't worry, I didn't hit it
7Yes
Phew :p
7I took up the interest in birding at age 20
12Ha what else could make a red flash? :>
7But since then, I admired birds
12How old were you?
12Back then
7I was probably 13-14
07Bleh I regret getting into birds, myself.
07O.o
7You shouldn't! Birds are amazing creatures
12I was about to say that!
/me never really "Got into them"
07LOL!
12Want to know how I got into birds?
7We're all different people
/me was brought here by his ex-mate, just stayed
07I'm curious
XD kay :p
07who was that?
yes.
12Er yeh? XD
7firefox.
7><
Imma boy.
07and idk if you want to know how i got into birds so imma shush btu
12CP, I was 9 years old
07I EAT ARTI'S SENTENCES
07they're chewy
12XD
oh well I'm probably wrong about the gender of other people aswell
6i know what you mean, stupid thing
07Yay happy stories!
7Quite a nice way to get hooked
7I bet he did that on purpose just to see if you were interested in birds
7Like I said earlier, I was always interested in birds
12Maybe, I'm not sure
7I've been to bird sanctuaries
7It's like heaven to me
only need Â£1000 to own a hawk
07And then you need to care for it
07Lol
07Anyway
12yeh lol
7I should of mentioned what happened after that on my story Arti
07it started with gryphons for me actually. I read the word, wondering 'what the hell is that?' from looking up the word gryphon, it went to the eagles, and then from there¨
07from before that I'd had an interest in eagles
7Grandfather brought me his binoculars and said, "Let's watch birds", I smiled. :)
07the story, in its short version is a story of losing everything
07and then taking years to rebuild the life you lead before.
07:>
12...Mmmm...
7You suffered emotional trauma?
red tailed hawk are my 2nd fraf hawk
12Whats your first?
7Because I went through the experience as well, a nervous breakdown
7Losing interest in my favorite activities perhaps permanently, didn't want to talk to anyone
7I had to start from the ground up, after taking a counselor's advice
12For different reasons I'm sure..
07I stopped paying attention in math class as a result, and since I took great pride in achievements, my confidence fell. I kept on studying bird anatomy, however.
07I was bullied throughout 4th-10th, and finally... One year ago.. I've gotten back into things
07So I became very mistrustful
07Although I've finally started to get back to where I was! And yeah Articuno and I share some similarities, but are different in a lot of other ways!
12Which reminds me..
7At least you were popular...
12(because I just invisined it again)
07Hm?
7I didn't have many friends back in school
12I still want to make that picture of you and me, how I'll ever do it or find the time I don't know..
07Oh which one was that again?
07you mentioned it but I keep forgetting.
12I want to draw a colourful spiral of orange and blue moving forwards and gradually seperating then splitting off at the end into a Moltres and an Articuno
07Ah yes, that lovely art idea of yours
7That's...a great idea Arti
7That's real art right there
12Yeh but I want it to look exactly as I see it in my mind, so I'll probably take a very very long time to ever get it right
07that's okay.
07http://blackfeatherstudios.com/irreplaceable.html
07wow
12Maybe I'll paint it.
07Look what I found on my server
07o.O
07from my former friend
07emily
07Dwaggin, if anyone remembers her.
12V______V
12Yes
12My heart kinda sunk when I saw that
12Just realisation really, that such good friends can go seperate ways.. it's sad but it's life.
o_O;
07Articuno it was my own fault.
07I drove her away too, but it's an experience I've learned from¨
/me brushes the ashes off
12But you're still irreplacable to her and everyone else.
07It's okay though. I still wish I was her friend but yeh that's life and it goes on..
/me huggles
12Heh
/me huggles
12I feel that way to one person and one person only
12Surprisingly Fox. When we were friends.. we were the best of friends.
12I really REALLY wish things hadn't turned out the way they did, I had so much fun in his company.
07I think I only feel that way about Emily.
12:>
07Because deep down I know it was because of my whiny/depressive nature and the fact I didn't dare be myself during my last visit to her that did it. I only realized that in hindsight though, and it made sense when I talked to a certain peregine about it, too. If she talked to me today she'd find a far more confident and less whiny person.
7Ah, you two are surely good friends
07Were.
7yes, were
/me laughs at kyu
07We were inseparable. But yeah ^^ fond memories I'll always hold onto. Sides I can't really afford to sit down and be too too depressed over things anymore.. I really can't
02hawkito ^_^
07Because a lot has happened, I sorta have to accept and move on, otherwise I'll drown in my own tears o.o
07Anyway HI Umbreon!!!
/me pounce
7My first friend in life was a pretty half-german girl and I drove her away due to my spoiled personality
7I was probably in love with her at age 5
7Puppy love in other words
/me 7sighs
07Well at least you learned from it.
7I can't find her on myspace or facebook
07Ah...
7But I did find her brother
/me pounces back
12Thats good enough isnt it?
/me had a good friend for 10+ years until something stupid happened.
12Contact him?
12D:
/me floofs Umbreon
7Not exactly, he won't answer the PM I send him he read it and ignored it
7Her name was Melissa and we were good friends, we shared the same interests and I hated being in separate school classes from her
07Articuno may I PM you?
12Yes indeed!
7Sigh I hope I get over my depression soon
7These suicide thoughts won't go away, I need more confidence perhaps
/me slaps CP out of it
12Don't be like that >v>
/me feels CP
12EW LOL
7Ow
/me RUNS!!
o.o;
No...
I meant understand o.o
/me 7spits out
/me is food.
o.o;
7Why doesn't anyone have enough floof
7?*
12I knew what you meant, I was just being immature XD
:p
7I'm like this for several reasons Arti if you're interested
12Mhm
12Go on :>
02no fair
02only i can be immature
12:O
/me sits down
BIRDS CAN SIT?
OVO;
7Well, ever since I lost my internet best friend and my RL best friend
/me sits on Arti
/me does something immature
7I just wasn't myself
7Then I started thinking about my capabilities, like why haven't I got a house yet and why I haven't learned how to drive
7The negativity just kept coming
PM, CP?
7Do as you wish
7I had no one to speak to, share my feelings with
7Finally expressing my dream of becoming a fantasy writer just made things worse
7I wanted readers and critique so bad, it's ridiculous
7Then the negativity struck again, which lead me to stop writing(or at least try to)until I had some positive, understandable critique but I figured it was just selfish of me
7When my folks were willing to give me some driving lessons a year or so ago, I nearly crashed my dad's truck
7He wasn't happy but he understood that I froze during the back parking and nearly rammed into my mother's car
/me 7sighs
7If I'm gonna get my license, I need more confidence
7but I'm too late, I'm losing interest in gaming, birding, talking to my friends
07Lol what+!
02so when people address the relationship they are like "Bow and Arrow"
7I have a very un-interesting and depressing life right now
12But why?
07Lol Umbreon!
12Why are you losing interest I mean?
alty
I was close!
lol
07no you weren't
07not at all
;_;
well
/me cries.
we are moving tonight
/me bonks with an oversized inflatable mallet
/me plays dead
/me offers seed
/me pecks at the seed
Heya
/me offers more seed
7Sorry for sudden AFK, went to get a snack
02No ty, I'm pretty sick and don't have much of an appetite >.>
7Articuno	Why are you losing interest I mean? < - depression symptom
07:>
07I know its difficult but still
7That's the thing, I can't really
07Oh?
12I get it..
Hai
7As you may already know, I'm very bored, so bored that it's affecting my depression and I look forward to working again
12Sometimes when I feel really down, I don't do anything but sit here on IRC all day and hope people will keep me company xD
7I only work a few hours for a few days of the week
Feather wanna see teh Dukehz? :#

12CP go on
02Yes, a funny joke, but it's cruel....out of my 7 ducks only 3 survived....
/me hugs everyone

http://kritterkorner.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/badparenting.jpg
well they aren't using it and they want me in bed by 10 *rolls eyes*
if its on they'll know its me
Ever considered getting some black paint and then covering the power light with it?
lol seen that before Horo
It's what I'd do
Then they wouldn't be able to tell if it really was on or not
07lol
yes I have considere d covering the lights but they'd notice when they used it themselves
07Arrow wouldn't that ruin it?
Depends where the light is
12LOOOL...
on the front, and its screwed to the wall
Horo that is epic win.
12Good idea
http://kritterkorner.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/badparenting.jpg <-- That's a mallard bird with it's chicks.
:P
/me wonders if that pic is for real XD
07[23:53:23] <Arrow> Depends where the light is <- ahh ^^
07lol Arti
Arit my mum recons they would of helped the ducklings if it was real, itsa possible they stayed on gthe other side of the grid
07something like that happened once with my cousin
12But yeh unless you remove the paint every morning, not a good idea
*Arti
12Lol ok
Oh
lolk*
You can also try using black masking tape
Cover it at night
I need to take a highres pic oif the router then paste that bit over the lights...
Then remove it in the morning
07lol that's random
LOL
Just make sure you wake up earlier than your parents so you can remove it.
I've seen that pic before
07Bleh

12True yeh..
07Yeah
07But I kinda want to work on the sidelines too because I could use the extras.
07We'll see,. I can't go against her until January anyway
07ARTI
07i just realized
07this year
12Looooool I couldn't go against what my parents said even when I was over 18
07in august, 12th or 13th I believe
12Yeh
07I will has
12Oops wrong window
07been here for four years
07whee
/me petpets Arti "good luck finding one"
12^^ ^^ ^^
07I still remember I was afraid of you LOL
07and even more frightened of falco XD
Ah, just listening to the Cardinals singing outside is very relaxing
12Blah, who wasn't? he never related to the members here
07he was menacing
07o.O
Oh, I remember him slightly
I --- what?
07I thought Arti coveted you, didnt want anyone else talking to you and such XD
07until I got to know you
Your first impression of me, I remember, was "Why the heck are you on TST?"
07that's what I thought for ages!
07Lol!
12What?!
12LOL
12Why?
07LOL Articuno because he always PMed you or vice versa
07and never really talked much to anyone else
12XDDDDDD
07and Arrow LOL!
07I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE OTHER ARROW kvfkafdklaa
07sorry XD
Well, you're not the last one to think that
12Arrow Quivershaft?
07yeah
12lol
and I do tend to keep my relationships to a minimal
Quivershaft sounds....oddly dirty. @_@
07LOL it does
... lol
because I'm too lazy to type it again
Me? When I get back
07Arrow he's not my type at all lol.. he's good to discuss redtails with though
I don't know when
07Sure
07I'll join arrow :>
okay
tell me when you do though
Go ahead without me, I'll probably stay here for a while
/me huggles the peregrine falcon and squishes him ^v^
This comp can't run much
07Arrow i have tons of other stuff to do though so :)
And THOU CANST SQUISH A ROLLYBURDY.
07for example TRY and work on BFS
07noo
its just not much fun to play it alone ^^;
07THTATS CHEATING jfjagsnja
07Quilava I know
/me squishes a rollyburdy anyway
@Quilava You should poke Elysium and co.
but I barely know any of them D:
/me also pounces arrow
07nooo not my floof
07FOOFY
DYNAMITE PLANTED!!
07DYNAMITE DEFUSED!!
We require more vespene gas
/me defuses it
12LUGIA EATING
Geez
/me plants moar dynamite.
DYNAMITE PLANTED! DYNAMITE PLANTED!
/me defuses it all
Argh
/me eats the dynamite
07arrow run out of engineering power already
07oo
I need something spicy anyway
/me gives arrow some mineralsa
/me uses the /kill command.
07-a
/me kills himself.
07o.o!
/me watches for spawn points
/me respawns as another Engineer.
07oh feesh
/me camps arrow's spawn point
/me because he is evil like that
Good luck, spawn points in Wolfenstein are pretty hard to camp
You can easily camp outside it but they provide sufficient breathing space to allow a rallying of allies at the very least
/me gives Arrow a recon plane.
Any spawn point can be camped with the good ol' shotgun!
On the contrary
That I know of at least in online FPSs
There isn't a shotgun in Wolfenstein
Damn. :(
Someone modded one in and it turned out to be pretty useless
/me gives Arrow a watermelon.
12Spawn Camping in Half Life is dead easy though
The best way to spawn camp is with Field Ops
12and even worse in Goldeneye.. I remember the spawnning points and the order they go in..
And even then it's prety hard.
07lol
07meeps
Ha ha, you're definetly a fan of that game Arti
You get a 5 second invulnerability when you spawn in
Or was it 3 secs/
I forget
07Hm
12Yeh it's pretty bad XD Don't tell Pidge but I've cheated loads of times to beat him that way, just by killing him then quickly running to his next spawn point over and over XD
07I should go check if I can play a game against arrow in worms
07If it's at all possible
07o3o
I think it is
10Lulz, I'm making a funny July 4th pic
12WORMS LOL.. only time I played that was at work last year ^^
12Is it TST related?
I used to own the game, when I played multiplayer with my friends an relatives, my weapon of choice was the proximity mine
There are mines in Wolfenstein =D
07[01:43:35] <Articuno> WORMS LOL.. only time I played that was at work last year ^^ <- I LOVE that game XD
12That's Xai's weapon of choice too >v>
They're actually really fun to operate
07i bought it and let arrow borrow the disc
07:p
I used to know the Facility stage by heart, planted mines at spawn points
12It's the ONLY way he can beat me..
10[18:43:40] <~Articuno> Is it TST related? <--- @me?
12Yes ^^
07without the disc, nowa lot of the cutscenes turn upside down
07lol
07I tried today arrow
07it
07floofed
07o4
07*o3o
12LOL
10Nope lol but I can add TSTers in there
07Oops dumb cube
12Nah dont! I was just curious, just make it how you were going to make it
07I seriously want invulnerability to that thing XD
10XD
Or you could just stop flooding
07that too
07>.>
07<.<
Then she can't complain =P
Of course
/me spots a landmine and checks it on his team's command map.
07[01:45:32] <Arrow> Then she can't complain =P <- lol true
07and meh XD
07arrow
07why did they take that away anyway?
07I mean o3o I loved that line
07Landmine spotted, check your command map!
07Like OVER AND OVER AGAIN and now
07it's all boring
07and imma check link arti
Well
071 sec
If Arti gets it and doesn't patch it, you'll get the full saying
The vanilla Wolfenstein hasn't been changed at all
The mod No Quarter changed it
That's so evil, Arti. LOL
Barely anyone plays vanilla Wolfenstein anymore
And apparently someone is into hard vore
07LOL that amuses me a lot
07Oh Arrow that failed
07I was floofing around on furnet and apparently someone has a thing for birds
07because they kept coming onto me and stuff >.o
12OMG
Also, the only reason why there were so many frickin' landmines was because it was modded so that a team could deploy 999 of them
07that was yesterday, i got rather tired of them though
12Furries are SO inconsiderate!!
07so I left the network
07Yep -.-
/me can bomb them.
07Elion or something like that
07I dont remembe
12I mean would they REALLY do that IRL to random people?
07r the name precisely
/me coughs.
07I dont think so
07im sorry
You're making generalizations.
07but I once had a stalker person on there
07Not really
07heh
07I've had so many people be rude to me and stuff
Yes really.
07Nope^^
07I've been in the furry fandom for years as an observer since a lot of my friends started out as furries, i've lost count of the times when I've had to deal with incosiderate idiots!
07Or had to hide from them
That's... not really inconsiderate either. It's part of the culture at FurNet.
07because they'd be creepy like that
07e
07h
07Im not talking about furnet only
They are inconsdierate
07Very
07I was not thrilled
It IS inconsiderate because it's assuming that anyone who walks onto furnet is a <censored>!
12Who-re
12LOL
Lol.
07LOL
Killed by your own bot.
So, you're calling me one?
Look
12Erm no, why do yuo think I am calling you one?
Because I go onto FurNet. <.,
*<.<
12and if you're not like those people we're generalising, why are you so offended?
12Ok thats nice, did I say everyone on furnet was a who-re?
Because I hate generalizations.
07so do I and arrow, but that's besides the point
12Yeh but you just generalised them yourself
7Stereotypes, peh.
It IS a generalization. There's bound to be a few good guys out there
12You said that's how the "culture" is
12and if that's how it is, why does it bother you?
12Ovo
Because I have the experience there to know what it's like.
07I've met a few nice furries btu i've had to look long and hard for them.
But the fact of the matter is, from our observations, that there are more bad guys than good guys there.
It's the same with the community on Battlestations.
Well, your observations are different from my own.
I wouldn't say bad
Just messed-up in the head
12Ok, but you still generalised them yourself
12and you agreed that they do act like that because it's their "culture"
Under no circumstances, CR, has anyone attempted to pressure you into believing what we believe
07But I still think it's rude as hell
12Bah, Cute just never ever wants to hear people say they don't like something that he likes
07when someone PMs me
And Articuno never ever wants people to have another opinion from hers.
07and assumes I'm in there to screw their cyber parts off with pixels on a screen. I get that a LOT
07and I think it's annoying and inconsiderate
12Where did I say you cant, paste it
12:>
@CR I think that was a little outta line
>.>
07Eh
When did I say /you/ can't.
12Where did I say "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LIKE FURRIES AND THEIR INCONSIDERATION"
07I agree with Arrow..
07that was just uncalled for
12I didn't say you said I can't XD
07LOL
Maybe I should abandon ship.
<~Articuno> Bah, Cute just never ever wants to hear people say they don't like something that he likes
07eh no worries arrow
12I just said you don't like it when people dislike stuff you like, don't you agree?
07we should all drop this really
07o3o
No, I don't.
They're everywehere on the internet
I don't like it when I know I have friends that are like that are GOOD PEOPLE.
I have a feeling everyone has some kind of fetish somewhere
12Well why did you act the way you did when I said it was inconsiderate?
Ever hear the saying, "there are no girls on the internet"?
07Arrow, thats probably true
Well, what do you think happens when they find one? : \
12There are lots of good people who still do things that other people don't like
07but the moment a stranger pushes them onto ya?
07I think thats where I get fed up with furries for
1. Men are men. 2. Women are men. 3. Small children are FBI agents.
07I get that a lot from the members there
12XD
07LOL yeh!
Indeed Arrow
So then why are you ragging on them?
LOL
07XD
I think what Arrow said applys to MMOs
07LOL...
Because for example, mainly guys play girl characters on WoW
12Typos due to RSI
I don't disagree with that. :P
07when we got wow, we had fun making a girl
07and then undressing her as much as we could
07o3o
07we fail though
I have a pair of female characters on Mabi
But by that same note, most people on there EXPECT that.
My main is a male though
You're such a pervert
j/k
12I know, and people should never expect things of other people
07Agreed with Arti.
07I mean ok
07One thing
I used to be a wow-player for 4 years
12It's very inconsiderate, it means people aren't thinking about other people, only themselves really
I got sick of it, nothing else to do
07person goes on furnet looking for pixelly smexins, another thing is
07when i go on
07and dont encourage ANYONE.
I feel very fortunate when compared to anyone else, who got addicted to the dang game
I wouldn't say that, Arti. It's just that when someone joins another server they're bound to that server's rules. Different servers have different rules
Since each server is operated by a different person.
07yeh but i dont think furnet has a rule on it that everyone should want sexual approaches when signing on ;)
Maybe
12It's not a rule to pounce all over someone and try to get into their trousers though
12lol
But then again
It could be an unwritten rule
12But that's what I mean
07Eh unwritten rules are called norms
Which is what it is on FurNet. ;P
This is the internet, sexual innuendo is common
It's an assumption that other people make
12If people actually THOUGHT instead of doing what they usually do without thinking, we wouldn't have that problem
Given your current position
I agree Arti
07you can break those and be considered odd, but it still doesn't mean they have the right..
07because I don't encourage it.
I'm not saying they're right or wrong
People don't think about their actions much
07If I had, then I'd lose complaining rights.
Especially when it comes to natural events in life
I'm just saying that I think that's what they mostly expect
07even when you only enter a channel and say hi?
07egh.
07fail.
12Yeh but expectations aren't very nice.
Maybe
07thats what I did
But they're human
07remember Namu?
07or kaycia
07she wouldnt leave me alone o.O
12Anyway I couldnt think of anything to compare TST with it but I thought that it'll be like someone new joining here wanting to talk about Lugia and us going OMFG HI LOL YOU'RE A FAT LEMON AND A SWORDFISH BRAIN at them as if they'd been here 2 years already
07LOL!
12Some might go "LOL im gonna fit in here" and others might say "WTF? Who are you people?"
12Hi Mib
"Some"?
07Yeah
12XD
07Arti
07if you had done that to me when i joined
02would anyone here call me an idiot
12LOL!
07HI YOU STINK OF SWORDFEESH
07i'd be
07creeped otu
02if i say i'm watching the twilight zone?
07and flown away
07o3o
12LLOOOL
07not reaklly Umbreon
02fine
DAMNIT >:(
02i'm the only one D:
what makes you an idiot just for watching a tv show
07ah well
Depends on the show
07Note to self
Sure, it may be questionable if you were watching teletubbies or somethng
Yeah
But you're just watching a tv show
07Im only gonna stick around channels where i has friends
07z.z
07failfurs
My external harddrive is out of memory D:
07LOL
07Arrow what do you think of the teletubbies?!
Teletubbies were after my time.
12LOOOOOOOOOL I used to be obsessed with them
07yeh but what do you think of them?!"
12when I was 10
Teletubbies were fail
/me runs
And I like watching furries
10?
07XD
And observing them
12YES 10 XD
Not about to join them
They weren't around that long if I recall?
12It was a school fad
The SFAF isn't furry enough. XP
Huh..
02kyu i need inspiration for a pokemon video game team D:
12Yeh they came out when I was about 10-11
07I have a couple of friends who are furries, but I'm VERY considerate about who they are
07and what kind of person they are as wel
07*well
anyway I'm gonna try and get me some sleep
07Ok
12Anyway it was aimed at 3 year olds but for some reason everyone loved them
07sleep wel
07LOL
07heh
07I used to watch them
07it meant
07I could rant and complain
07ALL I WANTED
12RN is a furry but I luffs her
I just observe them and keep a healthy amount of skepticism when encountering them.
I understand that, it's still pretty questionable though
I hope I can sleep, this sunburn isn't nice XD
07and blame the teletubbies
12Arrow, ever watched them IRL?
Nope
07[02:04:41] <Articuno> RN is a furry but I luffs her <- there are good furries too ^^ yeh
/me connects bluetooth remote and watches some movies instead
Night all
You've been to furmeets before, right?
12I have, that's the reason I'm not associating myself with them anymore
12yeh
07How are the furmeets anyway?
12I had a lot of fun till I started to relax and see what was happening around me
What WAS happening around you?
12Well the ones I went to were just a group of idiots getting drunk etc.
12Oh and NON STOP YIFFING in public.
a party then
07egh
12Not serious stuff but enough to say it shouldnt be public
Heh
10I'm such a noob
07x.x
07feather
10I just figured something out on Photoshop
07I misread noob so badly
12Not exactly a party, there was no dancing
Yiffing in public? With their fursuits no less?
07ugh
we're all noobs to something
10that I've been wanting to figure out for so long
10XD
12No not always with suits.
That answers my question
And are there even enough women to do that with?
I was under the impression that most furries are male
12Yes a lot of the girls were horrible who-res
Arti, I have a question
12Yeh?
12Oh I went to a MASSIVE meet in London, 40+ people
My cuz would like to sign up, but we only have my comp, can she sign up on this?
12It's held in a pub or something of the like, boring..
12Yes she can
Ty ^.^
And there are some parties in which there isn't any dancing
My college hosts LAN parties every month =D
12My favourite :>
That means I have to log out for a sec, brb then
07Bleh LOL
07I havent ever been to a lan party
/me sighs
I want to play some online Brawl
But I completely suck right now no thanks to depression
I remember someone here completely owning me at a game once
12Best thing about the London furmeet is the Fursuit walk where everyone in a suit takes a trek around the city waving and having fun, that's what I like to see :> harmless, clean fun
07I was suposed to go with some friends like, in 2008 or so, like with the few people who actually gave a damn bout my existence
He waaaay out-skilled me, I was taken by surprise
07but the guys
07was all
07'this is a guy thing, no girls'
07and so I couldnt
12Ovo
07even though i was all 'pfft' x.x
07at them
That's awfully sexist
12Who was it CP?
07they were that kind of people
07yeah
I cannot remember, it was last year I think
07but they weren't really grown up either :p it just means I couldnt go!
My battle group could technically be furries but I think they're too militant and not sexual enough
You and I would be digging through the archives of the chat here just to find 'im
07[02:09:17] <Articuno> Best thing about the London furmeet is the Fursuit walk where everyone in a suit takes a trek around the city waving and having fun, that's what I like to see :> harmless, clean fun <- Ah yeh! that's lovely ^^
07Heh Arrow I see your silverfalcons as original creations rather than belonging to any fandom thing
I should try to get someone to draw squadron crests for my characters
07she could do it
12Blah, furries are only furries if people call them that
Yeah, it is a stereotype
07yeh
07Hm
07I dont think i can quite label myself..
Funny thing is, they could actually almost be considered a fandom on their own. The only thing they lack is a fanbase =P
07I don't seem to fit in any really
07Lol
12I know I keep saying this but it's like calling ourselves INTERNETTIES or something because we all use the internet
07you got me, mii, lightning, orzel, uh
07icester o3o
12I label myself.... A TSTER XD
Orzel? Since when was he into the silvers?
07You didnt get that?!
07...
Such a stereotype exists?
07you fleeb, he was clearly interested.. lol.. he even wanted their story in written form!
Internetties? Heh
12What the internet thing? No I just made up the word now
07or so he told me actually
Ha ha, alright then
07Im sure Lightning and Mii would as well
I label myself as a member of the 116th TFS Windwhistler
07In addition to myself but ra
Because too many people use the internet for it to be a real stereotype
07116th TFS Windwhistler?
116th Tactical Fighter Squadron
Blah, she's takin forever XD
Aka the Windwhistler squadron
12But thats just it, it's the same as one stereotype, you all usually just have a few things in common and nothing else after that
07Ah i never saw the formal name
07I knew it was the windwhistler squadron but never knew its formal name XD
12Like internetties could be computer lovers, gamers and chat users.
07i has no squadron, no anything, I'm just.. foofy
07foooofy
12Im going to bed
07Ok
12I'm SO tired and have RSI
07Sleep well
'night
Bye Arti
07I should go to bed too but egh I dont feel like it
12thanks I dunno why I stay up so late anymore
Ah dammit
07take care arti ;>
12Night night
Arti I wanted to ask you a favor
12Ok quick
02you leavin Arti? Gdnight
It's not sadly, it involved the Wii
12LOL
12Sorry night CP
I wanted to see if I could send you something
There's also the Azure fleet, which is Remington's fleet.
G'night
Ah, dammit
07Arrow mrr, wait
What?
07Ok now I'm probably gonna be whacked but..
??
07what's the difference between a fleet and a squadron? XD; *prepares self for pillow-throwing for lack of knowledge here*
Fleet = navy
Squadron = air force
07Ah :>
07Ok
07makes sense
Oh crap, Sneas is on
Every air force consists of squadrons, which is broken down into elements, which in turn is broken into planes
07You dont like sneas?
Now's my chance to send him my top best match
07Ah...
07Arrow, what are the names of said elements?
07I wonder because
07I'm curious o.O
I like him, I'm just taken back that he considered me his best friend when we barely spoken to each other
The elements don't have names. It's simply part of a squadron
He just likes me a lot
That's how the silvers have it, the real air force has it differently
hi
07Sorry but he was awful toward one of my best friends ever and such, caused her distress enough to make me want to flay him :>
07But
07I'll be civil so no worries XD
07I just dont speak to him anymore
Every air force has a command, which is part of a numbered air force, followed by a tactical air force, which is broken into wings, which is broken into squadrons, then flights, then sections.
07Ah...
07Seems quite complicated actually
07Or more, component-y
7Fwew, done with the Fearow. :D
The SFAF is small though, so they just have a command, then right into squadrons, then elements
He's very interested in me so I'm only slightly disturbed
07yeh
07How .
That, and since I'm the quiet type, it's sort of my fault
07many silvers are there anyway?
Maybe in the ten thousands
Pretty strong
07Hm
07gets me wondering how many ships they have
07really
The Anadian military branches have 5 million
At least
07BLEH XD
07More than Norway
07's population
07again
07argh
07lol
Anadia is frickin' huge, remember
It takes up over half the world
07I dont actually
07did you ever draw a world map?
I think so
07Or is it that one named arrow is lazy or something
07in my old files
Endale takes up about 40%
Anadia, maybe 55%
02I forgot my password yet again :o
The rest are small islands and Cyroia
07Hm
07I forget how to pronounce Cyroia actually
07it looks like the name to a greek island..
07Cyprus
07oO
07or something
And how many ships does the SFAN have? They probably number in the mid to high hundreds
07that's the association i get anyway
07Ah ok!
Maybe around 500 at most
That's more than the USN
07Ahh
Anadia and co. have a few more
But they're much stronger and sturdier than SFAN ships
07hey arrow
07I always wondered
Yah?
07what happens if you fly into the cyorian dead zone by accident? do you freeze too?
If you stay in there for too long
But it's impossible to fly in there by accident
07Oh?
There are too many signs - visual, magical, technological, and otherwise - that makes any competent alarm go off like crazy
It's impossible to get close to it without knowing
07Ah
07Has it ever happened though?
No
07Ah
07Ok
07O.o;
07that timefrost thing
07is scary.
Ahh
/me flops on Arrow
Yeah
so how is everyone?
It was pretty brutal
07Why..?
What game is the Cyorian dead zone from, anywho?
07Just because they helped the silvers?
7WHEW.
Yeah
7Done with the emoticon meme. X3
07in his universe of floof
hi Quil
Oh, okay. Sounded like something from a game, like Freelancer or Darkstar One.
Yeah
The Anadians really hate the silves
7Freelancer --> Freeshooter + Whirlwind Lancer
7 O_o
07[02:28:36] <Quilava> so how is everyone? <- Hot and somewhat lonely but also ... okish aside from that
And they want to make it clear that anyone who aids them will be punished severely
why're you lonely? :(
Even if it's an entire country
07Heh
07so everyone got blasted?
07even the civilians?
07Oo
Yup
07Bleh
07flail
The few ships that managed to escape the missile's effect were sunk by naval gunfire from the fleet that launched it.
07[02:31:19] <Quilava> why're you lonely? :( <- its nowhere near as bad as it was.
07No survivors?
There could be a few
still D:
But the chances of surviving the frigid waters of the North Rygelian Sea are
slim
At least
07Mm
07Quilava no one is home z.z
Suffice to say, neither the Anadians nor the Endalians bothered to search for survivors
07so I has no company
07heh
07I feel sorry for them
So any survivors would have to paddle all the way to Endale or Anadia
07how did they find out anyway?
we're company D:
The Skywind
It's pretty hard to lose sight of a ship that big
The Cyroians hid it, sure, but scanning equipment is a little more advanced =P
07Arrow is spiffier than a raven :>
o.O
07chocolate raaaaaaaaaaaain
o_O
/me 's mind is dissolving
07[02:35:24] <Arrow> The Cyroians hid it, sure, but scanning equipment is a little more advanced =P <- Yeh lol
DYNAMITE RAINNNN

/me plays EPIC MUSIC.

Argh. I feel like playing Wolfenstein now
Ideally with TST people
...
/me hums Ideal.
07Ideal~
/me steps on a rollyburdy
But yah
07yeh=¨
It'd be awesome if we could play Enemy Territory, everyone =P
07^v^
o_O
The more people you get, actually, the more useful you become
eh?
07Arrow
07Make a forum post about it
With what account?
is it an online game? :|
07...
A free online game, yeah
07Oh you fleeb -v-
07why did you..
07X
07df]a
07british layout!!!
07brb
/me is curious of this Enemy Territory. o.o
Enemy Territory is an FPS though
07Sorry
It's a freeware game
How system intensive?
Not very
07Lol I suck at FPS things but I love them anyway
07XD
Could a 2003 computer run it?
07because of my accuracy people can get me quite easily
07and Im a bit harmless :p
The game was made in 2003
So probably
Link meh? :3
07No u
D:
Well, exCUSE me, Princess!
o_O
07but my statement still stays
http://www.planetwolfenstein.com/files/files.shtml
07arrow is spiffier than a raven
Yeah, the fun part is how low the requirements are
And how free it is =D
hi Slash
07LOL
I'm trying to convince Arti to set a server up
hi's
07free ftw
07Hey!
^^ *huggles her*
07how are you=?!
07I mean
Yeah, it's frickin' hard to find a game that good that is completely, totally, 100% free
07after 10 days of almost ignoring you
07i
good
07can
07talk again
07o3o
07i am no longer busy
07AT ALL
07c ube darn you
07ffs
They apparently were going to release it as a commercial expansion pack to Return to Castle Wolfenstein
07[02:44:14] <Arrow> Yeah, it's frickin' hard to find a game that good that is completely, totally, 100% free <- so it is 100%?
07or?
And then later as a standalone game
But they had problems with the single player aspect
The multiplayer portion was released on its own
07ahhh
Yeah, it's totally free
The creators have abandoned it almost completely
07Ok ^^
It's now totally open source
07Nice :>
They also made Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which is commercial
07One thing I didnt know
But I like Wolfenstein more, because it's free
And it's already moddable
So ya
07you tried the commercial oen?
07*one
07ffs
07i cant type
07my mind is goo
Nah, I haven't tried the commercial one
07Ok
lolwb
07so how do you know you like it better?
07|XD
07GAH
07BRIT LAYOUT
07FAIL
I like it more because IT'S FREE

MAGICAL DOOM PUTTY!?
The first three.
all three?
Mmhm.
The first one is the game itself.
Actually, some servers only work with the first one
The later two are patches.
Some servers don't accept patches
07I keep staring at it
Huh.
So I'd go with number 1 only
Okies!

The bird was long dead. It had met a bloody fate.
The end.

Sometime. XD
12Yeh when we can be bothered to go round in circles for 2 hours again
6LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Fine, but if you want a really thick smoothie, you need to put the blender on a low setting, changing the logic. :P
7Twenty-six measures done. X3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8lTYvVB9Zg&feature=related
How many measures are there? Oo
7Dunno. :P
Articuno: If you, and Xai can come up with a response to that which explains how I'm wrong, I will eat my hat, or, as I don't have a hat, I will eat my father's hat.
BRB.

You're worse than the other two at debating lulz

12k
12Also, I official dislike Gale of Darkness :/
6why
6?
Back, and, alright. Whenever you feel like it (if you ever feel like it :P).
12It's stupidly hard for what it is and it DRAGS like hell
12You spent most of your time in that one volcano place just trying to get to the top!
lol - I'm currently playing it and for some reason I spend ages trying to find things in that oasis town, forgot its name.
in the first game it took me ages to find the mayor's house
12and when you do, what happens?! (spoilers stop reading now) you have to face 6 shadow Pokemon including all the legendary birds and you have to try and catch them all without your Pokemon fainting when they are at way higher or the same level as you
I've never finished it but that can prepare me :)
12You'd have to train for hours to get your Pokemon above them
12Well RN
6yup
6the stupid island takes AGES to get through
6Agate village
6the ONE place I adore
6yup
6I've hated gale of darkness for ages

6and lollag
12If you want to do it properly you can't fight the boss till ALL your Pokemon are at least level 50, or it's damn near impossible
12I really hate how every shadow move is super effective against regular Pokemon.
Well I had major trouble with the Hearthome gym leader recently, I'm only up to that part due to work
I hate that colliseam series
but it's ok now, I cheated by sending some over from pearl
12I liked Colosseum
I never finished that either hehe - I still have it
12It was hard but Not THAT hard
12and wtf BF

Well we get pheasants in our garden all the time. :) Lots of meat on them. XD
12Hey if me and Xai buy a house we're going to get a peadge shed and have homing pigeons
12Lucky!!
6AWESOME
Sometimes we see the deer too - they like to eat the rose bush Oo.
Are you gonna eat the slow ones?
>_>;
Deer meat is good too.
12Bleh, I dont like it
12Duck and Beef are my fav meats ever
07Heh
And on the rare occasion we see foxes.
07Articuno'
12FOOOOXIIIEESSSS
07Arrow ate reindeer when he was here
07o.O
when I get a house, I'll try and get at least one or two Lugia statues either into the garden or into the entrance
12XD
We used to feed the foxes.
Left dog food out in the garden, lol.
07Meeps
07I think I want an apartment
07but then again
12But that would cost like a million pounds
6lugia stone fountain O______o
07I see myself living alone somewhere in the far future o.o
07with 483984 birds
/me yawns
02i am beat
07Hopefully someone proves me wrong XD
I'm gonna be living with my mum til I'm 50 by the look of the economy xD but who cares
/me is dead too
You can hear the owls outside at night, but I don't think I've actually seen one in our garden.
think about this LotR-scene:
http://der-herr-der-ringe-die-schlacht-um-mittelerde-demo.de.joosoft.com/resource/screens/12/12191/91769.jpg
12THAT BIG?
and now - take the two guards away and replace them by Lugia :P
12That would cost more than my fountain XD
07o.o
07wow
nah - not THAT big. I doubt I'd get a building license for such a big thing^^
07Guh LOL

gah, why is it that hard to find an authentic trailer?
Authentic trailer for what?
12Because it's only been released in the movie premiere..
12Nowhere else
12There is no trailer on the internet
6no one was ready for it, I'm sure
02o.o
at least I found a trailer for Heart Gold & Soul Silver
12Yeh thats good :>
12I love the moving Lugia intro..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ntU21VM-Y
oh YES!
12What?
I think I saw that
02?
02oh
blargh I hate this one user on dA. >.< They're trying to copy me and they don't even use proper grammar or post their own art.
7O_o
12Lets see? XD
Which one user?
Hey.
Argh. This computer crashes whenever I play >.>
6I ADORE that preview, TS
6it looks fabulous
well, I don't /hateHATE/ them, but I just think they're kinda annoying. >.<
12YEh like I said, I like the Lugia intro
6Arti, yup
6looks amazing
12Ho-oh's one is prettier though
12They used the wrong colours for the Lugia one..
6it's prettier, but lugia's is more drmaatic
eh... Imma brb now
Hey Arti, how's your RSI?
6arti, game creators...of course they use the black color lol
12Still pretty bad but getting somewhat better XD
hey, Lugia doesn't need all that Bling-Bling. He/She's great enough even without it :)
12No not that
LOL, the weird pokeball thing that comes with HG/SS is a rather strange idea.
12The background, they made it dull green water rather than a rich deep blue like the Deep Ocean Lugia theme
Anxious to see what you think of Wolfenstein
6ah
6but I'm still irked by the blackblue color of the fins
12Me too but meh
hey, my cell phone is a peometer already :P
6then again, it's offset by the heavy shadowing in my opinion, aming it look "deep"
a paedometer
6but yeah, I see what you mean by the greenish
12I was about to mention that actually
/me hides
??
one of the many useless gadgets the korean from Samsung built in to prove the performance of their G-Force-sensors...
6it looks too close to the surface
12loooool
Uh, me? Or someone else?
12Huh?
12you talking to me? (this is confusing LOL)
Nevermind
I must be confused.
6Soul Silver box art ftw
Hi Arti
I must be mistaken
What were you about to mention, out of curiosity?
12The Lugia fins thing
What's wrong with them?
6too black
they're much too spike-like I think
Ahh
and...under the water they SHOULD be close to the body
6hmm...
6I agree about the spike part
6but I think the fins can be kept upwards if it wants
6part of the voluntary movement
hi Xeli
nah, would be way too uncomfortable - and not needed
6I guess at the speed it's swimming at, indeed
12It drags
12But anyway
12It's just for show
6but if it were just going along with the flow, maybe :/
12It's an intro after all, and it's not the best graphics
I bricked rawra too hard...
6LOL
/me holds up the broken brick of cheese
plus not everybody around the globe is so well concerning Lugia anatomy, right Arti? ;)
6yup
6...
6the back fin on that lugia is too far back in my opinion
Lugia: EVEN ANTHRO ONES CANT WEAR SHOES.
6there's enough space to put a 6th fin in there =/-\=
but Lugia only has ten fins. Five on each side
6I know
6my point
not eight, not twelve, not seven or nine :P
/me checks again
I thought it was four per side?
12FIVE PER SIDE
6but in the opening animation, they spaced the rear fin too far back
6which is what I'm complaining about
12DON'T YOU ARGUE WITH THE LUGIA MASTERS XD
aye
6LOL
LOL Arti!
you go
LOL
:/
I've already been a Lugia fan...many of the community were only babies when I started :P
6only we can carry a lugia conversation this far based on 2 seconds of clipage
/me 6splodes
6LOL
she's the Admin of TST, she knows what she's talking about
/me throws a masterball at arty
6I've been a lugia fan since.....the very first time he was revealed
I'll show you a lugia master >_>;
/me heads into his eleventh year of Lugia-Fan-being
6...
12hmm lets see
6huh
6has it really been 11 years already?
12It was December 2000 for me, when I saw it in the cinema
6wow ^^
did I catch her?
12?
yes, Lugia was revealed in the beginning of 1999 in Japan. And that's the moment I learned about him :)
6hmm
6when did the first pooemon movie come out on video?
6pokemon
12I missed that LOL
:/
121998?
6...
6wtf....
I don't get why the legendaries don't just sidestep master balls
12Actually
121999 here I think
in Europe, yeah
12Blah
6ok, well I saw one of those "second movie previews" and that's when I first saw it
given how far away they must be to appear so small, surely they have plenty of time to dodge?
12LOL
maybe they're fast
6don't remember where I saw the preview
6so that was early 200 then
12Why can't Articuno freeze the ball?
6 2000
it was 1998
Arti
Exactly
in crappy Letterbox format *goes chasing the idiots of WB for doing this sh....*
You're one :/

I know I shouldn't ask and put any pressure onto you, but as I simply can't close the tab with the sketch in it and trap myself staring at it several times for every hour: Will you really colour it?^^
12If I can
12But I took one look at it in Photoshop recently and thought "This is too much work" so really, the hardest part is getting past doing the lines

12I agree actually :>
12She's SO skilled, but not to my taste either
wb drf, Hai GUEST and Vyl~
07Hi everybody
hellos
Hai~
07No Cynder today?

12Nope! Not seen her
12Quil, I've not got $139 out of $375 for hosting ^^
12Now

12Was putting it off all this time
7AERO
12I don't know.
4if the site gows down...
won't they charge you extra for that?..
QUAN
07We were busy last week so I dont think she was on at all. She usually comes on daily when she's at her dad's house though.
12I think it's because I have to pay on Xai's card and I feel guilty
Xai's card?
its his birthda-
oh wait
/me nods
12and nope they'll cut service in 2 weeks of not paying
12lol
4so if you dont pay
4then the site goes poof
12Yes, but they will then hold my data until I do pay, for a further two weeks I think
Rharhraharh
4o good
Its so fun
looking through old files
oo3
12and if I don't pay after that, then it goes poof
*o3o
Articuno
12But I should just do it, I'm being lazy
I found logfiles! Like
7Failzors
4i would recommend making a backup copy of the data
12Eh?
From when Arrow and I first talked XD
12Can't run a website without backups.
/me is on her old compy
4never
12PASTE

I would be SO annoyed if that happened to me
12In THAT way *points above*
Data recovery and repair is one of my many areas of knowledge :>
12Yeh it's kinda late for that
I just decided to make it one huge notepad file.
12I recovered these about.. last year I think
Oh, that isn't a screwed log. That's non-ascii data that got mixed in.
12There;s nothing of it Vyl, other than that.
But yeah
12Can you somehow recreate the log from just that?
there you go, thats how I got to know arrow o.o anyway
Not if you just paste it over IRC. You'd have to send me the file to examine.
That actually looks like the output from some kinde of encryption o.o
12Lol
12One sec'
And even then, only if it's a charset-detection issue.
So probably not.
12No it's just screwed logs
LOL, my log is 217857 lines long.
12That folder has some good logs and some bad
Aurora~
I actually remember that
6KIPI~
/me sits all over Aurora
Eh?
What do youi remember Arrow?
/me must have made the most horrible first impression ever
lol
12Didnt seem so
Apparently not ^^ lol
Although the rest of the earlier logfiles..
7RORA
7*late*
http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8137000/8137922.stm

/me was just looking through
12COOL!!!
Ok

7O_o
7RORA

Mehneway
7Hai, Ecco!
Near 220k of lines of text is only 7.8 MB. LOL.
Hey Ecco

12Some type of deer
6what...
6oh o_O
6wtf...
12You know why that's rubbish?
7O_o
12Deer do not have five fingered bones
6lol
7Evolution fail.
6who the heck said that?
12BBC fail actually

12This newslink that BF posted
12http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8137000/8137922.stm
6LOL
12It just says "Oh there's a type of deer that hides underwater if threatened so that's good evidence of whales evovling from deer!"
7...
6so.....when I hold my breath, does that mean I'm descended from a whale too?
12lol
12Other way round XD

7It's cursive. Wat?
dklsdfkdsd I can't wait for Sky's new chapter. X3
6same
I've lost almost all interest to write recently
Hello BullMastiff~
/me 7randomly pokes Aero with a pickled daikon
/me flails and noms it. :D
I really don't like life right now
6Feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.
oh - I've got a magpie on my balcony^^
Yay!
6how cute o3o
those are one of the more intelligent birds ;)
6Magpies?
12I've been trying to attract those :/
/me 6is reminded of ASoM. D:
12They're ALL over the place here, they're right below as I speak
12But they never come up onto the balcony
/me 6asplodes in a flurry of tragedy.
did you know magpies are able to recognize their picture in a mirror?
12They're making a lot of noise at the moment
12Yes, corvids for the win
12Did you know Ravens can use logic?
I did
I really love ravens and all of their birdish family :)
that's what I disliked the most when I visited London quite some time ago...
6ravens are gorgeous creatures
and intelligent
12What
12?
6yes indeed
12The fact that they eliminated them?
eh?
may I quote:
12Ah yes
12These are pet birds
12They can still fly, not not long distances
with clipped wings..
12They can flutter about
12Clipped wings isn't nice
6it's depressing
6like declawing a cat
12But it doesn't hinder them that much
I'd like to clip the hands and feet of those clipping bird's wings!
06Back ^^
6yup
6oh fudge
14Floof
06Awesome ff ^^
6I have a dentist appointment like.....right now o_O
12I think the reason they have clipped wings is so that they can't breed, I don't think they will allow them to spread across London again
there's plenty of that kind in old europe
12They do particularly well in cities though
I know. We've got some of them in our parks ;)
12Lucky
I know^^
I see ravens all the time here. Oo
12No you probably see crows
It's hard to tell them apart from a distance.
12Ravens only live in the West
12Nah
I'm on IRC at home. :3
Ravens are bigger, and have a slightly different head shape.
12Look at the tail and size
06I see an eagle up north when I go there. ^^
12Tail is DEAD giveaway
And different tail, but you can only see that when it's spread.
Hm.
12No honestly you can see that when it;s closed up as well
12Infact it's easier
12Hold on
12I find images
I've only seen ravens at the tower...
I've seen wild rooks though!
A rookery, no less. I walked under it. If you ever do that, take an umbrella.
12Rooks are all over the surrounding areas of London but not London itself funnily enough
12LOL
whatever - they're all members of the same family ;)
6Pigeons in the Big Apple *random* :P
06hiya SL didn't know you were here. ^<^
6Ohai.
oh, did you know "raven" is originally an old-german designation for a very wise man?
12Can't find suitable images but anyway, raven tails are wedged, crows are rounded almost square.
12and no
they called such a wise wanderer "röiven" - pronounced exactly like raven
12Ravens can count :>
and they can notice if they're being watched :P
06I've saw Ravens when I was in Yellowstone. lol
12Wow long time no see
12How you doing?
are you Gentle Lugia

evolve**
07SORRY XD I'm somewhat hyper - high on air or something again
07:>
shold a level 26 machop be a machoke by now ?
07I dont know
07I dont ave platinum
i think its lvl 30
or 28
07What does captivate do? oO
Found it on TV Tropes
07well what does it do XD
1. Mew can learn every TM.
07... Oh!!!
07I REMEMBER XD
2. Attract and Captivate can be taught using TMs
07but mew has no gender
3. Attract and Captivate work only on Pokemon of the opposite gender
4. Mew has no gender =P
/me uses attract o3o
so what happens then
/me floofsplodes for the fifth time
5. A Mew with either of these moves makes no @#$%ing sense
-TV Tropes
07O.o why did you eat me?
is mew a it? or a trysexual?
tri**
/me is quadrasexual.
/me pokes back.
/me wants out
/me is quite sexual. Er, whoops, wrong term.
/me kills herself then respawns o-o
07Lol
boys/girls/pokemon/some small machines
07;P
That's new.
An example of Fridge Logic - How does one battle while Surfing?
It glides as if sliding. it startles foes by clamping to their faces, then jabs with its poison stinger
07LOL Arrow
07I dont think you showed me before
/me nibbles Arrow ^v^
07Leave my +h alone
4bk
07wb
Mew is said to be the ancestor of every Pokemon. But it lacks gender and can't even breed with ditto. So how did a Pokemon unable to breed end up with so many descendants?
how mmany steps to hatch the egg cynthia gives you in platinum
07Ugh LOL Arrow
anyone know?
07Not me
Not that many, took me about 10 times down cycling road.
07check gamefaqs or something if they have the answer!
cause im at 1,413
12Lol
i reset counter at every egg
12Well it's something like 5000 for Shinx..
/me SLUUUURPS Articuno!
12so I'd have said around about that
Hey Arti, you got my PMs, right?
12Hi Drag lol
12I got one PM about Dark Natasha but what about her?
She was taking commissions at AC.
In Platinum, to trigger a battle with the Legendary Golems (Regice, Registeel, Regirock) and thus capture them, you need to have Regigigas in your party. To battle and capture Regigigas, you must have the three Golems in your party. Does anyone else see the problem here?
4hi arti
-TVTropes
07Lol!
07So how do you get them?!
12Yeh but ..?
12What about that?
12Did you get one or something?
I should have so gotten you a commission from her if I could have afforded it. XD
Arrow: No, to get Regice, steel, and rock, you need a special event regigigas.
I'm just reading TVTropes on Pokemon
That's what the response said =P
12How much were they? I emailed her for prices and she hasn't gotten back to me
I didn't check the prices
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitlei015gc004kw4?from=Main.Pokemon
Like my badges? :>
12Well..
12The big one yes
12The others not so much sorry
Apathetic citizens: And how. A crime syndicate takes over our city? Cults attempt to flood and/or dry out the world? Some god-wannabe tries to restart all of creation? No problem, I'm sure some random ten-year-old will take care of it for us...
4nice
07Lol...
/me has heard all this before ;p
Let's see, the big one was from a random artist. The top right is from Fossil, and the bottom right is from HollyAnn
07Hm
12Never heard of them, probably because I don;'t like the styles
07But I have a particular art style pereference
Fossil draws things not appropriate for this chat, and Hollyann did a comic.
07and am picky as to which anthros I like
12So do you know how much paintings were from Dark Natasha?
07Glad you like them though lol
/me jumps out of his cover and tacklehugs Articuno out of surprise
12:O
No, but I'm guessing it was around 70-100 USD
/me loses floof in fear!
/me collects the floof
12Bah, guessing's no good XD
12and thats a LOT of money >v>
/me then glues it all over Articuno
12But worth it
12I really want a commission from her.
07Who is she?
Commissions from those sorts of artists are expensive.
12Someone who draws perfect anthro foxes
07Link?
12I would die to see her do Xai
12Ok one sec
07Kay
I know my Aquanat commission's price was about 120 USD, and I got that for free since I helped the artist.
/me 4puts arrow up for saill
12http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2153610/
12http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2153602/
12and one of my all time favs..
07Pretty
12http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1967644/
But yeah, I saw a bunch of artists there.....Including Tinintri. x.x
12Did she know who you were?>
I also saw Likeshine, and commissioned a badge and full commission from her.
Yes
Considering I had my badges and my AC badge?
4brb shower
12Aha.. I thought you wouldn't have gotten that close up to her
We were pretty cordial to each other, though, because the upper staff of AC aren't afraid to ban people.
Oh how I dreamed she'd pull something and get kicked out.
12LOL...
12Evil Drag.
07Hm¨
07Are conbadges required for furry conventions?
07o.O
Hey, you want evil? A lot of people at AC now know what she's done :D
/me talked.
A lot.
conbadges
12Oh! I wonder if you encountered Fox and Falco :> I dunno if they went though. But I would have thought they'd go.
hur hur hur
12LOLLOLOL
No, I didn't see them.
12Drag is a gosspier
12*Gossiper
12fdh
12tuio
12lyiop;
07Ugh
12D:
O_o o_O
/me disapproves.
07But eh XD

The only recent picture I can find of myself is modeling my new cape.
I don't get many photos taken.
07Oh no
07That one will just give her a weird first impression XD
I'll have to get one taken to show her then :-)
07Ok ^v^
gosh - my favourite electronic market sent me a commercial "buy the new HIGHSPEED 8GB-USB-Stick for just 9,95€"
well...'
'Highspeed'...
3,5 Megabytes/second...
8GB for ~ £5? O_o
Hmm my MSN won't open.

10 Euros is around 13 dollars
but including VAT
12So it is euros?

Huh... there are no photos of me in the family album.

backspace
12Soo coooooooooool
6wow that head has like....perfect anatomy
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8140594.stm
12I know!
12Also reading
12Yay they're getting the ball rolling but I still doubt it'll be as good as Windows
6???
12"applications will run in your browser instead"
12Wtf?
Seems like they are starting to implement the cloud technology ovO
12Yeh..
07Im not sure I like that
07My father did though, but then again
12I'm going to try the Chrome OS eventually
07I swear new technology turned him on, lol.. an attitude that rubbed off on me sadly! lol!
07Very difficult to be at the edge of everything new with no income ;)
12Yep
It is a cool idea, and even though I will try it, I am going to try and stear away from stuff like that ^^'
Windows XP for $20? Hah! I doubt it.
MS wants XP to die now. It's continued existance is an annoyance to them.
lol...
6holy cow this artist is amazing o_O
12Yeh I know!
If you buy from microsoft themselfs it is still R1300, or about... not bother to do conversion >>
12XP for free pls
Vyl: Try telling that to the netbook companies. With them, it's XP or Linux, and the majority of the people want a Windows-type OS.
12The Linux one sucks
12It has good games though
Articuno, XP is already free for you >>
12Yeh thats what I mean Lugia :D
/me runs
I said MS *wants* XP to die. They can't seem to kill it though.
I've seen that pic already Arti. Looks...well...interesting oO
12OMG I can't wait for Windows 7
XP is preventing the sale of more Vista and Win7.
same
Has win 7 been launched yet...?
nope
12Not officially
Noone is upgrading because XP is already perfectly good. businesses are downgrading.
12The beta version is out and about
just the Release Candidate is available
12You know, the reason Vista seems to have so many sales is because of businesses
Windows 7/ Vista < XP
nah - all our office computers run with XP or 2000
12But thats just it
12Businesses bought new computers, they all came with Vista, so on the surface it seemed like Vista was selling when in actual fact, they all put XP on these comptuers
6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
07I need to downgrade.
not really Arti
12Well here at least
Dell and HP got an agreement with Microsoft to sell their business computers with XP
12How long after Vista was launched?
still
if you go to Dell as a private customer - you get Vista. If you're a business customer, they give you the choice: Either Vista or XP
12Well that's good but how long did it take them to make that agreement..?
not too long. But Microsoft did that agreement with them BECAUSE they persisted to sell the machines with XP
12Lol, yes ok, but the vista sales still rose because of businesses.
12Not everyone uses HP thankgod
But did the *use* of Vista?
12No
Highly fishing unlikely :D
12Thats why the stats are skewed :>
hopefully windows 7 won't be terrible
Almost any new computer baught has Vista on it, with the option to downgrade to XP, but you will have to pay more for that... or at least it is like that over here...
12Or you could just use an XP disc.
yeah, bercause some blind bosses in small and middle companies prefer some random PCs from small electronic markets and stuff instead of business machines
12Andrew, I had Windows 7 at work at one point ^^
12Last year
I know that - because I've worked for such a stupid boss long enough
12I didn;t get a chance to use it much!
lol the leaked one?
or the beta?
12I reckon back then it'd have been leaked
ok
12But not sure
supposedly it's WAY less of a resource hog
As far as I have heard Windows 7 has the performance of XP with more stability then Vista...
12Our manager got rid of it and everything else shortly after
that's about it Lugia
Windows 7 is MUCH more glitchy than even vista.
12It's in the beta stages..
The Beta, yes
7 even runs on most Netbooks
12Wow impressive
and by "run", I don't mean run like Vista, but RUN
Yes, and I doubt they'll bother to fix most of them.
12Well they have.. 3 months..
12So we'll see
I'm actually alive to disapoint you :P
Look at how long it took them to do anything about the IE exploits.
the tills at work still have ms-dos >.<
12LOOOL
i notice most tills do, Andrew
12Easier on their end
12Tills at CEX didn't :D
12We had XP lol
12Damn.
lol
heh
12Every Windows OS seems to have started out that way.
I've never seen a till with XP before. D8
12Well at least the more recent ones
Most things start out that way.
Like the Sims
!
12There's a PEEEEADGE on the bird table
7Oh, look who came crawlin' back to us!
Well, I nearly drowned yesturday at the military pool
I saw peadges at AC!
7skillz.
jumped straight in the deep end and got stuck
you have a bird table? o.o
7Hahaha
7very skillful
I got to touch them, they were that used to humans. :>
k, you can Preorder Windows 7 on July 15th
I know
12Andrew yes
12I has video
cool
that's all ricky kept saying to me when I got to the surface
i still need to visit your new place
7Then whoever ricky is they are a wise person.
Lol
He's my quater brother XP
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR0Z-qXy0Cw&fmt=18
failtastic
He's my quarter brother XP
7...quarter brother? I don't think that really counts.
12We have a much better view here
12Many many many birds
it does lol
7Like sixth cousin. Who honestly gives a crap?
cool
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suOYA9WMyak&fmt=18
half brother and half sister's half brother
12Different birds ^^
are you on a lower floor now?
125th floor
7since when do you have a half brother and sister?
I call them my brother and sister
7aah.
12South facing :>
they're older than me
/me gnaws on Articuno's wing.
12aaaaaand
12We can see storms coming from all directions miles off
somewhere in their twenties
7Was the half-sister the one that got to meet David Tennant (*haetz*)?
yup she met him
and Mrs Blair
7*haetz_some_more*
/me takes the wing with ehr!
12<v<
7feh. who cares about Mrs Blair?
I think she met rod stuart as well
12Anyway brb
she got to aska question about her husband that I really don't want to repeat lol
7... repeat it.
Lol stacey's listening to the spyro sound track
any way
7... repeat it.
okaaay
lemme type it
sheeesh
/me holds Articuno's wing aloft, victorious!
She asked mrs blair how tony was in the bedroom lol
sorry about the pause
7heh
7she gave it up with me a while ago.
LOLOLOLOL OH MY GOD
She just asked if she could download a webcam
7LOL
7LOOOL
o_o
that's an interesting mental image
/me 's wing and returns it
/me points out she only has the wing, not all of Arti. Vanishes with Arti's wing.
And that is what i just shouted :P
how will arti fly now...
she needs two wings, two!
7feeble minds predict great minds. :P
I've got a blonde joke
well a few
7I'm not sure which way round I was supposed to put that, to imply you were the feeble.
/me escapes easily by taking the wing to her home plane, which only members of her plane, or Travelers, can get to. :>
7feh. going to kill things
nobody escapes the time :P
Pfft, I did exactly that!
no, you didn't
Because time isn't the same in this place compared to my home plane. >
:>
So thus, that created a rift that automatically called me back XD
so - how could you notice such a rift the moment before you catched the wing?
No, the rift was created by the difference between the time streams. XD If I were from a universe that were connected to this one, it wouldn';t have happened, but the place I'm from isn't connected anywhere, but is sort of connected to all dimensions. Imagine a bag of marbles, and one marble isn't in the bag, and isn't touching any other marble. XD
Bloody laptop and it's bluescreening -v-
/me pets lawts
12and back
ROARA!
It's hard to explain, and would take me a good half hour, at least.
/me wonders how would an articuno wing taste....
6timetalk makes my head hurt
the problem is: I'm part of the time itself
Ganderish?
12Nooo
12Ever eaten Seagull?
But you aren't part of my plane's time.
6O_O
Nooo
oO
12Something like how that would taste I imagine
o.o
12XD
6LOL
My plane's time is seperate from every other dimension's time.
/me has crabs, places a friendly one on rawra's head
his name is jimmah
6o____o
nope. The only constant value all over the universe is the time
And no, Articuno, he may control time of all the dimensions open to him, but my place is neither a dimension, nor open to him, because he is not a Traveler. XD
6how can there be two different...yeah
This is one reason I dislike RP's, some people just can't lose ^^'
6time is the same
12LOL Lugia
6o_o
6LOOOOOL
/me gahs! tosses crabs!
Nonono, you threee miss the point. .
i hate this time talk!
IT HATCHED
Arti, you've read some of my stuff, right?
6I personally think it's intruiging when I can follow alon
2628 steps :)
6g
/me stuffs a crab in Drag's mouth >_>;
12I can't remember any of it Ovo
k, even if I can't control or manipulate YOUR dimension and timeline - I can manipulate ALL the rest :)
6and ow......massive headache all of a sudden
Alright, one moment, this is going to take a bit to type out
"You don't have to pick? it up to move it. Just scare it away. That would be much more efficient than picking it up and scaring it to death." ...Clearly if it was going to move, the approach would have been enough to scare it off.
/me travels back in time and simply movies Arti that far away so you can't reach her wing if you get into that dimension
Yes, you can manipualate all the rest. And it's not a dimension. Hell, the place is OUTSIDE of all of time and space in all of your dimensions, because TECHNICALLY, it doesn't exist.
12LOL
meaning: You don't exist
12If it doesn't exist, then you don't exist, therefore my wing was never chewed
6then-
Pretty much, yes
6yeah
6nds vidhsvblidfxf
12LOL
6lateness
07Pointless argument ;)
6then the cake is a lie?
The cake is no lie!
6and there is no spoon
6SETTLED
There was a cake XD
hiho
6lol
reminds me of an Achievement in World of Warcraft: "The cake is NOT a lie!"
XD
07lol
I know that achievement
you receive it if you bake a delicious chocolate cake :)
6:D
*cough* what would be best pokemon for me to get for hearthome gym
Room cleaned finally :D
y*cough*
I'd go into semantics and specifics and such, but then all I'd be doing is spamming the hell out of the chat. XD Because first I'd have to go into what the Void is, as well as all the bubbles of reality and the Sanctuary, then I'd have to go into just what the bubbles are and what Travel;ers are and how they function, etc etc etc.
*cough* **
*COUGH*
i have a cold *cough*
*choke*\
*(muffeled noises)*
12I should clean my own room..
/me uses hyper beam and hits everyone

Random question
07=^.^=
"The only way evil can succeed, is if good men do nothing." <--- is that quote accurate, or did I word it wrong?
07Kipi, I believe you got it correct
04It's accurate, if you mean that statement it true.
It's a quote from a book, methinks. I heard it said in a game and a tv show.
07Its a pretty popular quote
/me stretches and sprawls out.

why do you need to see all hidden files?
2I was dead earlier
02i have reasons
How many blondes does it take to change a light blub?
2And ya don't wanna know about that!!
2LOL LIGHT BLUB!!
mm... should I go draw?
making hidden files shown is the same as in XP IIRC
6uhh 12?
well, start the windows explorer with administrative rights and then change to Extras/Folder Options
02well i would of figured it out if it was the same as xp lol
/me is listening to: Nightwish - Elvenpath - 278
you should find the options there
none
6>.<'
but, to be honest, for the most part it's good Vista hides most of the files from the users. Around 96% of all problems regarding the computer result by a user doing some crap
2?
It is in the same place as in XP
it's in folder options
02yeah
02but the way to get to folder options is different
02since vista doesn't have a menu on each window
it's in control panel.
the very first place I looked in both XP and Vista
aye. You just need to have the correct user rights :)

Yeah the thing is though
Using HACKS on an online multiplayer game is just stupiud

Takes the fun out of it

Yeah.
As for the hackers themselves I have a nice way of dealing with them
they should make a sistem were haks arnt aloed
Anything can be hacked.
lol
But you forget people can override hack protection systems easily
As long as there is someone with enough time on their hands.
wb
Dari it takes 2 minutes to override the hack protection system on CA
:/
02meh
...
Wow.
02redownloading openoffice is the last thing i wanted to do
That's like the protection of flash games.

Hey
Again

the 345987529828727524th time
lol
PM? or are you to busy?
Im not busy but
I disconnect
A LOT
so you might not want to x.x
oh
kk
you saw me in the main channel
Im honestly
in a very very bad mood z.z
oh
i thought you were kidding around
and doesnt help that someone else is all snugglyish all over me
No Im not Lol
/me had no idea you were snapping at me
*her
No it's not you
oh
It's my connection.
ahh
I'm not angry with you at all!
Don't worry!
kk
whew
that's good to know! ^^
^v^
Lol only one person here is capable of making me angry ;p and that person is not you :> Aside from family members
I hardly get mad or whatnot
so whee
/me splodes
lol
/me knows who it is =P
now if this piece of crap can stay connected I will be happy!
I get mad mostly in religious and political debate places.
LOL XD
Vyl, haha
politcal i do
10gah, true
Relgious, meh not so much
Religious and political debates should be banned, and not just on the internet.
10LOL
4make me somthing
OMG! O.O
that's terrible!
It's also accurate.
It's a typical Digg comment.
are you Libian?
Libians = liberals?
Or?
Am I miostaken
I think Libyan is correct
Except on Digg it's manditory to have at least one "Where's The Birth Certificate!" per discussion.
ya
From Libya, I think he means
Ah Lol
what Ragnanrok said
WHY MUST YOU PEOPLE MISSPELL MY NAME.
/me is uneducated ;p
02come on msn plus
02finish
LOL
i type fast?
Anyway
/me flees
I use tab. :P
Libyan = a nationality. Liberal = a classification of political position. Libtard = an offensive term for a liberal.
Religious debates here.. dont remember if that's against the rules or not
But I think it is
10discussions = fun
Ever since it got upleasant at times
10it's the general direction they take that sucks
Yeah
XELI
10generally people shouting "NO U" at eachother

totally
WELL YOUR NOT!
/me is back.
NO ONE IS
6lol aero, don't take bf seriously
lies :(
he's just an idiot troll who I'm supprised hasn't been banned yet
6I learned that one myself >_>;
oh really?
I'm not a troll
o.o
lol
6trolls are big and green and hairy with an IQ of -4
/me 6splodes
I'd say you'd be trolling if you took what I said there seriouslyy.
I thought I was the only one who thought that, Quil. ^-^;;
Like BF?
LOL
lololol
@Aurora
6of course, bf has been banned
o_O
i have
6but it was taken off
because people misinterpreted what I said ;n;
6i dunno, it's hard to misinterpret what you say
6but eh, if you actually mean it is another story :/
well what kind of idiot takes somebody saying that they're perfect seriously?
it's obviously sarcasm, and if you can't tell, asl
*ask
failing that, don't get angry with me, becuase the opportunity is there
Because obviously it's our fault that we misinterpreted you, and not your fault that you didn't explain your viewpoint correctly. >.>
so know your calling me stupid?!
yeah
*now
totally man
you're stuuuuupid
wanna go ass?!
you know
^now I'm being facetious
instead of arguing with an idiot, just report him
it makes things easier
hmm
07=.-.=
Okay
o_O;;
Damn it you guys
whoa, what happened? o_O
I look away for one second and this happens
LOL
XDDDD
One thing.
t
10as said, sarcasm and the internet is a potent cocktail of fail
:<
6>_>
Okay look
6it doesn't happen that much >>;
totally
innit m8
We've been through this before
it seems to happen an awful lot when i'm on :(
6not really
/me feels like it does
6but you react to it the strongest, which basically makes it worse in your eyes
6we all just ignore him
Yeh
^
CLEARLY.
Taking things he says with a grain of salt
stinks
Permission to lol?
/me isn't upset, really. <.<
07more like half a grain lol
I LOL Egh
6LOL kipi
but it hurts when people say things like that
ONE MOLE OF SODIUM CHLORIDE
10welcome to the internet, sadly
6GAH
6CHEMISTRY
6it burnsssssssssssssssssssss
yeah?
heh
You have to learn eventually to filter things like these out, its very common on the nets
i don't see why I can't be sarcastic on the internet
6o_o
takign everything literally is a forumale for boredom
If you guys REALLY want me to we can talk with Arti again.
*formula
07because you can't read sarcasm
10and a formula to be trolled, BF
But I think it's unnecessary
no
10sadly
which is why you can ASSUME
or ASK
and we've been through this loads of times
(capitalised for emphasis, not shouting)
07or you could always just not do it
but why?
07because it obviously ticks everyone off
then I would have NOTHING to say
;n;
Exactly.
because sarcasem FAILS (sometimes)
BF is not good for the community. :P
you're not my friend anyway
;______;
6>_> ok seriously this is dragging out
I beg your pardon?
i say we kill it
Okay
So I'll mention this to arti, be happy

05leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenk?
12I'll just come out and say it, I'm really disappointed about the way some of you guys acted earlier
/me is going to Paris with ICT Department some time soon
4whos been caving
12Do you lot even know what went wrong?
I went caving somewhere in Yorkshire once... Can't remember where though.
05BF you need to get some onions and a berret
4no
hmm, what happened?
05they are manditory
i did nothing
bonjour mon petit filles
12Liar
hey, he started it!
/me enters the respawn queue with the /kill command.
blame him!
12What did he start exactly?
12As far as I could see, he was saying LOL IM PERFECT AND hANDSOME
i dunno
...and rich
10lol, it was obvious sarcasm.
pip pip
6which isn't bad >_>
12Well, he's neither of those things, you all knew that, so why did you take it to heart?
6dadoodlydo
let's just forget it
6</drakeandjoshlol>
are you saying I'm not handsome?
12Ok sorry, maybe he is handsome :>
oh
12LOL
yay
6LOL
6that was winsome
/me had no idea....
12I won't forget it because if you don't know what went wrong it'll happen again...
12The main problem is, that whether or not BF was trolling, what did you all do?
look, i try to be nice, ok?
12Well I say all but I'm sure everyone here knows who I'm referring to
12Please just listen
3Welcome, Guest1114403! Unfortunately you are not a prime Guest, however these are your prime factors, 37, 30119.
12You all attacked BF
hi2u
k
12You started naming calling
12*Name calling
6Kyu, PM?
07k
yes, i understand
12That's not acceptable behaviour even towards trolls :/ and BF was JOKING, how many times have we been through that..?
/me nods
12It's four of you in total that I can remember off the top of my head
kk
12I won't say any other names because like I said, you know who you are.
i'm sorry, i'll try to control my feelings
/me backs all of this up.
6I can't even read that far back with mibbit :/
12and one final thing, WHY the bloody hell havent any of you learned to use the bloody ignore function yet if you say that BF is always like this and you don't like it???
i just....
If you do that
12Just the main prob here is how everyone acted
12Well that's at least one good thing to hear
You'll use energy on a lot of negative stuff which could have been used on something far more productive all through your entire life.
That's all.
6huh, ignore is a universal code?
/ignore
/me 6learns even outside of school
derp
ok... sorry all
6lol but nah, it's ok
12But then if he doesn't know what's actually happening, if he only sees one half of whats going on around here, it's even worse to start attacking someone
<Articuno>Just the main prob here is how everyone acted <<< That will always be a main problem, everyone has different opinions and essentially most of it leads to arguments and negative feedback
/me sighes
and thanks Arti ^^
12So if my opinion is that I should attack random religious people for being religious, does that make it ok?
12What are you saying then?
ffs... I wasn't saying it was acceptable I was saying it will always be a problem
We should still fight it though even though it might be recurring.
I think what he means to say is that it should be expected, not that it should be accepted
Expected and accepted are different
@Arti: Of course! Slapping overly-religious people is great </irony>
minimise the chances of a problem occurring
07lol TS
Arrow, thank you for putting things in clearer terms
Arrow explained it better for me, but nevertheless no matter what we say or do, arguments WILL occur it's inevitable
12The rules are clear though, and I think that if it's your opinion to attack people when they annoy you rather than report them, then you're more of a troll than BF.
12It's not about the arguments, it's the attacking etc.
/me is a trool then
12There was no need for all the nasty stuff said to BF
-_-
Arguments, Attacking etc at the end of the day they are all the same thing
12They're not
i feel bad!
i think we should just all have a fight to the death
BF you aren't helping LOL
last one standing gets to eat the corpses of the losers
6I'm fine with arguments, but attacking is when things are unacceptable
YA!
6arguments are natural lifestyles
12and Im still waiting to hear an apology from the others but I dont know if I will get one, if they're even bothering to read
The ultimate reality is that Arti is a dictator. She's the server admin and therefore everyone has to follow her rules
Ah, I apologise BF for wat I said. It was wrong of me to say :P
yeah
/me gets the giant pile of cotton balls and hands them around the channel
6Arti, was one of them me? I can't remember if I said anything offensive. If I did, as far as I know it was to ease the arguments
6if it was me, then I apologize :/
12Rules can be bent. It's all common sense really
here - take those and throw with them!
it's fine
She could be worse, and boot you off if she disliked you but she doesnt!
12No Aurora
She's rather kind like that.
no need to apologise to me, I'm not too bothered P:
lol
Accept the damn apology BF XD
6LOL
4lol

Apologies from me if I need to. I had meant to do so already, but it slipped my mind. <.<;

07i'm usually up for at least an hour before i go on XP
I'm slowly running out of TTZ episodes to watch.
But there are so many!
Vyl
7So, what's new?
Yes?
do you know anything about what my PC might mean when it refers to the .pif file of an .exe?
Ohh, that's an old one.
Havn't seen one of those since the 9x days.
It's a Program Information File.
yip
It's something like a shortcut, but more specialised.
yip yip
YIP
It holds information relating to starting the program - console size, compatability settings, starting directory.
I've got an .exe that cannot be edited in any way, shape, or form, and one of the errors windows/ubuntu VM came up with mentioned it
:o
You can make one just the same way you make a shortcut.
Yeah, but it looks like it's not what I need
Windows refuses to let me do anything with the file - even run or copy it, the best I've got so far is that it can be copied in Linux, but not even that can do anything more

7It breaks them down at the molecular level, translates them into electrical signals, sends them through the machine, then reassembles them on the other side.
7Wrongly.
Woldn't that be Womkavision.
7No.
*Wouldn't that be Wonkavision?
2It probably would
Or more realistically a teleporter. :P But I was havng fun with it.
7aah, but it teleports things /wrongly/
7inside out, backwards.
7with three heads
Ah. Can it make chocolate though?
2Is a moron :)
/me 2runs
:P
But really, I have to show you smething.
*something
7if it involves the word Ni, heads will roll
No, really. Have you seen this? http://www.swtor.com/media/trailers/deceived-cinematic-trailer
You never showed me, lol.
7I did.
7I linked it here.
7You said "Lol, Clone Wars."
I just found it a few hours ago, because I was curious if they were making any more KOTORs.
Also, I doubt I said that.
7Someone did. I think it was you.
I definitely don't remember it.
7You don't remember a lot of things.
I knowI'd know better than to think that was Clone Wars though, haha.
yays
I get to go to the mortar range this weekend
7Yeah, then when I said "It's not Clone Wars" you said "I know, but animated Star Wars." or something similar.
RDX: ...Oo
Yay explosives? o_O
KJ: Definitely not me.
7Probably dari then.
7Irregardless, I linked it here whilst you were on.
...
Not me.
I don't care/haven't seen that link before.
And I didn't even open it now.
Yeah, you get the credit or whatever for that.
Got to go, though.
Seeya.
7Dari, you forget a lot of stuff.
I would never say "Lol, clones wars." Because I don't see what's laughable about that, as I don't watch it.
7The laughable thing is animated Star Wars.
O_o?
yes explosives
they are much fun
and HumV's
Hey

/me sneaks away to add to the contribution
12I haven't managed to make the full amount yet though
/me sighs

I recently found out the total amount I spent on commission work
12Yes I'm surprised I got so much already ^^
12How much?
All of it just to get my literature some attention
12$1023?
12:D
12Um what?
12You only got commissions for that?
12I thought you got them because you wanted art of your character Ovo
Well, it was nice seeing my OC brought to life
But I would of just stuck with the commission you long completed and perhaps Hitana's too since she was the first to draw her human form
Then I noticed how much I wanted people to appreciate my work
So the money continued spilling
02what the heck
12So how much was it then?
I spent over $700 on them
6O_O
12Wow
02how long was i dced?

12Havent been here
12Probably since 6.13 my time though lol
12So, about 3 hours
I just came here for today so I'm not sure
Anyway, believe ir or not. I STILL want to set commissions
This time, I'm looking for comic/manga commissions

You know, the problem is, he might go and start a raid on the forum.
07don't worry
2So, why are there so many trolls here today?
How good is the proxy blocking on the forum?
07he hasn't registered
6lol
2O.o
2How can you tell?
07and I can always deny the registration
2:O
2IP?
07i looked up his ip on the forum
Oh, good.
2Oh
There's 100s of them though, so you won't know which is a troll, and which isn't.

10GUEST

10hmm i can't recall the name
2have a link?
2of which, whenever a new idea is created, it has it's own bubble
6I believe they can be real, but that's a below-the-belt blow lol
2the bubbles can merge or separate
10and they actually passed the forum on to "true believers" when "there were no more lulz" there
2Sort of like the things in "the BFG"
THERE I posted

10i mean...
07that's trolling imo
/me 2has no idea what just happened
6lol
6plus the "laugh at you people"
Well, if he makes a post on the site, and you have 50 trolls signing up to the forums, how do you know which members are legit?

7Dialga/Palkia are easy.
2dusk
7Catch them in a quick ball.
7Giratina's hard.
*gulp*
i know
7Use Dusk balls then.
2You get two chances
use a master ball =P
2save before you get there
it would be funny if i caught all the legends in a pokeball
or use ultra balls
they work good...sometimes
06Ovo

06FrozenX is the name of my Winter dragon on DC, I believe.

12yes
...three more hours until my desktop is entirely restored...
6restored? o_o
I said earlier: One of my harddisks crashed. I bought a new one and am restoring a backup I did...
02Most Extreme is on :O
I run a backup each friday evening...so this backup is about one week old
6aww
6that stinks
02wow
well, I lost the confirmation mails of PayPal for my donation and some pictures I saved from dA...the rest doesn't matter
Hi all
and maybe a few savegames from Half-Life2. But I'll get over it
02That sucks :/ reminds me of my old computer
hi
12Trying to get a TeamSpeak server up and running but I can only connect locally for some reason..
12Port's open on Firewall, so not sure :/
it happened once to me - quite some time ago. I run regular backup since then
12How do you back your data up? Spare drive?
Obsi used to have a teamspeak server didn't he but he doesn't have the net anymore
12Yeh..
eSATA drive atm
12I could do with an extra drive to back my stuff up properly.
but I'll go and upgrade my home server with a bigger harddisk just for backups and then backup via network
12and hope you don't lose connectivity :>
6bah....my competition is scary O_PO
6*O_O
12WHat competition
12?
I could upgrade this old computer but I'm not a technical person and don't know what I'm doing, so better just to go out and buy a new one. I feel good when I buy new stuff too, haha.
6Arti, T-Shirt designing
Like 'yay new computer'
brb
6it's for a scholarship
12Is it in your journal?
6kinda
6X3
12Hmm ok
12Ok what does the T-shirt have to have on it?
6anything
6I have a couple ideas, but they're rough ideas
bai pplz~
6THIS is when I need my CS3 intalled
connectivity? That's my home server connected via Gigabit-LAN ;)
bai now~
12So all these are the designs?!
12From other people?
I always used to think smexy was smelly + sexy and I used to be like O_O
back laters
12Looool
02XD
6yes they are
12Ok there are WAY too many entrants..
12There's 331..
12Ffs
well, that's why I've put some copper cables around here ;)
12and everything on the front page sucks
*reply to articuno* me to
wireless is just too unsecure for some data...
07gah
2ARTI ^-^
2hi
wb Kyu
in fact - copper is also not secure for the most part...
07i always forget how big carls jr burgers are
6looooooooooool
07oh well
XD
I would prefer using optic fiber connections. Those are almost secure
07now i have a burger for dinner
07also
6I don't stand a chance :/
12Aurora I think you should try your Tribal designs again..
07it's incredibly hard to walk a bike uphill while holding a soda
07especially if you're full
12You to do me
07x.-.x
12I hate pretty much every other design
6well, design wise maybe
6but pencil and paper :/
6I don't have a scanner, I don't have my CS3, I'm pretty cruddy with Corel
2hey Arti, hows everything going in UK, find a job yet?
12If you designed something awesome on paper I could easily make it into a photoshop file
12No I didn't otherwise you'd havce heard about it by now
6but my camera is so cruddy, I can't get a decent picture with it
07save up 80 bucks for a printer-scanner
07lol
12You can
6>_>
6I can easily pay for that
6but I don't want to
12The tribal designs you had before are more than enough for what I need to make it into a file
6I need money for college, the whole point of this
07well do it
07you need a printer for college
07XD
02Waste some money to make money :P
6not for community college
6 2 years
6ok Arti
6I'll try :/
im bk
07well 2 years of taking pics with a camera doesn't make much difference if you're gonna get a printer when you transfer lol

10I know
6.where the heck do you buy them, arti?
12Im so angry I ALWAYS miss out on good deals
10that's why I begged for this one XD
12Ebay
who might want an 18" Dialga or Palkia plush....if you can have a Lugia plush?
6my brother got his for like 30
6oh
...
/me sobs
12Becuase there are NO Lugia plushies for under $50 anymore
6GIANT LUGIA PLUSH
/me 6breaks into tears
6Arti, the new movie may change that :/
2hey Arti
aye, someone offered the Plush I have for around 200 dollars
2give me time
2I can probably find one
the 22" one
<Articuno> Becuase there are NO Lugia plushies for under $50 anymore <-- yeah, not cheap are they -_-
12Aha
6I think both of mine are 12''
time to steal
6discontinued long ago :/
might make some more when SS and HG are out though
2lol BF
12I'm really glad I got the Lugia plushies I have for cheap..
12Infact I got the poseable one free..
6yeah
same
6I got mine for regular $29
I got mine for 50 dollars
07lol
6(I had to get another to replace the first XD)
12My 22 inch one was bout $70 I think
and the poseable for 20 dollars
07i'm too cheap to buy plushies over $20
02I'm not allowed to get pokemon plushies ;v;
which episode (olny watched 2 so far)
hi
04WUT
10I JUST BOUGHT A 18'' DIALGA PLUSH
10XD
10EEEEEEEEEE *is still shaking*
but I have the feeling a new Lugia plush will be released as soon as HG/SS are out
12OMFG YEH
04Lulz
12Im going to buy it right away while it's CHEAP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY arti look
and IF Lugia and Ho-oh are featured in the 13th movie....there will DEFINATELY be a plush
02My parents dissaprove of Pokemon, they won't let me get plushies because of how much they are, they allow me to get the games, but only with my own money
10yeah
i found the poster 4 it
I won't care what it costs - I'll even visit the release party and try to buy the deorated Lugia there :P
7Hmm, I have a bit of a musical question:
the ho-oh movie
hi kipi
/me sits on Kipi's feet
its out 2010
6this means a ho-oh plush too
7What time signature is Caramelldansen in?
'-'
who cares about Ho-oh?
6I swear, if they start making those darn pokedoll things again, there's no hope
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY
/me licks a Kyu nose
/me raises his wing "I do"
Whatchu sitting on my feet for?
07so you can't escape
I dun wanna escape
arti ur were right
Lol, Caramelldansen.
6LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
/me sighs
ho-oh and luga are going to fight in the movie
12You don't know that
12And I hope they dont
2my money is on Lugia
Ho-oh wouldn't stand a chance...
12That would be the stupidest thing they could possibly do
10If i know them right...
10It will follow the lame formula AGAIN
02But that's what many are expectin, so that's what they're probably gonna do
10epic cgi fighting, then Ash saves the day
Hey im back :)
07lol
The writers can always drag up a plot involving mind-control to justify a fight.
2I hope Lugia wins
07that's a good formula
if you look at the poster it looks like there bout to fight
07if you remove Ash
07XD
2XDDD Kyu
07besides
2misty comes back and wins the day
12What poster?
07that's pretty much the formula for any movie
The only reason Lugia would fight with Ho-oh is if they were fighting over food, hehe. Don't they fight in the opening to the Johto series?
Nah.
10True that Kyu.
yeah, Ash just uses picachu and zaps them both to the ground XD
2yup
10All of it, especially the remove ash thing.
30 days of night. Vampires kill everyone.
2and hi RN
Love that film.
Well, except one person.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJZpKKsXAyY this one arti
12Actually know they seem to just be flying together
I don't like films where people kill the vampires.
^
12Thats not the 13th movie poster....
They bash into each other in the Johto openings
hey
2Arti, I think they are practicing moves with eachother, like what me and my friend do in Sparring
maybe that's how they say hello
who would win in a fight
2Lugia
12THey don't, they only fly past each other
The person with the snag ball would win
But that would endanger the franchise.
02It's not the anime that made those two rivals, it's the fans :P
07lol
07that's sort of the plot of the first movie
pokemon = poket monsters :(
12Thats why I think if they made them fight it would be REALLY stupid
And clichéd
6well who said they were fighting in the movie?
Kyu, not seen it, but didn't they use a magic memory-erasing thing to restore the status quo?
07you haven't seen the FIRST movie?
07XD
J
No.
yes?
6"Lugia fires some Aeroblasts while Ho-Oh uses what appears to be Sacred Fire. This does not mean for sure that the two will actually be fighting in the movie. It's just a teaser trailer."
12Roara, no one says it.
I've seen only one pokemon movie.
07well watch it lol
6quote from pokebeach
I went to the cinema with people who said they'd like pokemon forever to the first one, now they have long forgotten lol.
6Arti, alot of people think so
wahooo finally monferno evolved
12I know, probably predicting because knowing them, they will make them fight :/
/me 6STILL wants to see that trailer
When my mum and I went to see Pokemon 3, we were the only ones in the cinema
12LOL
02Because they also think that Lugia and Ho-Oh are rivals. Many want those two to fight
then they stopped showing them in cinemas over here lol
12The whole cinema?!
6true
Yeah
I'm surprised they ran the movie with just us in
07well there's no seeing the trailer until the 12th officially comes out
i think they should team up to stop a evil
they would almost have to
07and even then it's just a cell phone recording XD
That's the only film I've been to where we've been the only ones in the cinema screen room thing
/me 7blinks
6Ho-oh, the bird said to descend to the earth when people and pokemon live in harmony, and Lugia, peace keeping guardian of the sea....fighting each toher?
One of the many things I wish to do is collect the highest quality copies of every pokemon film.
i wunna see all the kanto/jhoto legends fight all the sinnoh/hoenn legends
But that would mean actually watching them, so... er, no.
12Yes I REALLY want to see Lugia and Ho-oh team up..
Why don't people say in a movie 'this legend thing is a load of rubbish'
7RENEGADES. ARRRRRRRRRRRRGH, That's the third time I encountered this word today. X3
that'd get them going lol
I don't think that, but it'd be funny
02The guardian of the skies and the guardian of the seas.
omg take a random guess at what lakefront im at
Like you know people in the anime who've never seen a legendary?
6verity
Valor
no
Placid
07the third one
yes
07XD
Shiny was right
I wins :D
What do I win?

6one of them
What's the smallest?
12Goldcrest
Oh.
12and Firecrest... they're almost identical in size
Articuno vs suicune... who wins?
6Suicune would have an advatage
Articuno has the advantage of flight.
7Articuno would win.
12They're both defensive
yeah
Burt
12But yes Articuno because of the flying type moves
shotgun results in dead birdy
7Mind Reader + Sheer Cold. :P
*but*
12Or SHeer vcold
12lol Quan
07lol
Articuno can use ice
12So?
10lol at everything really
12Suicune is resistant to it
6Sheer cold maybe, but water type attacks are average against ice
12True forgot about that
2yup
07it's basically water vs flying
12It'll be even then pretty much
6and then mirror coat
07and flying is physical
um
6lol
bulbasaur vs turtwig
07while Artis have a higher sp attack

02it outspeeds darkrai
OMG!

do not
02then switch into something that easily resists dark moves
i like Darkrai
02then kill it
i wanna catch it D=
and they faint, they don't die
02taunt pretty much says "forget you" to darkrai
6i didn't know darkrai was that fast...
that's why it says "Pikachu fainted"
02lol
not "Pikachu died"

Dark void is an item, or ability?
Ohh...

02darkrai is so stupid with it's bad dreams too D:
02As long as this Pokémon is in play against a sleeping opponent, that opponent will take damage equal to 12.5% of its max HP at the end of each turn. This ability will deal damage even if the opponent is asleep due to Rest.

07*Yeh?
I've been waiting two days for you to come on :>
07Hey Vyl!!
07Oh why? o.O

07I thought I said I was going away o.o
13Those things are bigger than the earth I tell you.
/me pokes EVERYONE
/me pokes back with a sharp stickle brick
/me turns into a white hole
White hole = opposite of black hole
/me pokes the whitehole i nto a black hole, making a grey hole
Which means = repels everything, even black holes
but blackholes suck in everything
Doesn't that mean stuff should come out of it?
/me repels the black hole instead
/me blinks
07Uh
If a white hole and a black hole meet, they create a paradox and rip apart the fabric of space time
Or that
02whatever is stronger probably would win
02it'd be quite a fight though
02black holes can even trap light
White holes REPEL light.
oo
Do black holes have different strengths of gravity? So if 2 black holes meet, do they negate each other, or does one suck the other in?
</nonsense>
2lol
02you throw an xbox 360 in

LOL

if two black holes meet, what sound do they make?

If God = some big old buy with beard, then no, it doesn't exist.
What exactly happens something goes into a black hole, it is crushed by the gravity, but can the gravity completely destroy, so there is nothing left of it?
no
2GUEST
matter bends space, thats whyu it could sucki in the universe and still be the same size
2GAST LY
CunderGuestGastly lol
2Man made black hole ish possible :P
What do you mean by "matter bends space".
2although that'll take years to create
How do you bend spaces?
space*
its complicated
I don't truelly know myself
If in space, there is nothing, how do you bend nothing?
That makes no sense.
Some parts of the universe, scientists believe, are so curved that you can see the back of your head
So imagine that
spaceisn't a perfect vacuum otherwise our atmosphere couldn't exist
so its not totally empty
Vacuum itself isn't exactly nothing, either
science kill XD
I once saw that explained on a documentary, but forgot about most of teh details
I still don't see how that warrants being able to bend it.
*the oO
Matter can bend gravity
How?
No wait
Matter can bend space-time *
random fact: gravity affects the space time, something that exerts a large gravitational field slows down time somewhat
Imagine space time as a sheet of rubber on a soft surface
aww beaten
02random fact
02burritos are nice
Now, imagine a space body eg. a planet on it
What happens?
it dips reletive to the body's mass
*imagine a representation of a space body
Yes
02easy question time
02what happens if murcury fell into the sun
it melts
7It wouldn't. :P
Not a lot.
I once heard that depending on how near you are to the Earth's surface, time may be faster or slower
that is correct
Can't remember which is relative to which
02time pace is something we invented
Ah, yes that.
i think we should just find a way to get the Plack energy and then talk about all this stuff :C
*Planck
You know, I wonder if it's possible that people perceive time passing at different speeds sometimes
oo
But the effect is so small, you need a pair of atomic clocks to observe it.
How can time slow down? By that, do you mean that 1 second takes 2 seconds to happen as an example?
Articuno once said that she felt time slow down when she was ill
You leave one behind, take the other up and mountain, and bring it back. You'll find the clock that went up is very, very slightly shead of the one that stayed down.
I myself find that time seems to be slightly faster when I have woke up
Strange, but true
people percieve time differently
Music sounds... faster
lol
/me percieves time as a big rainbow
But yeah
I wonder, do different people perceive time differently?
/me pokes everyone with a stick
hard to say without being that person
Yeah
/me poke'd
02a interesting little birdy with interest in space
..?
02but what he didn't know today that he'd have to use every bit of that info today
/me dances
02in the twilight zone
It could be possible that what I perceive as one second may be someone's several seconds, or that.
LOL UMBREON
-caps
TWILIGHT ZONE
If you get two people to count out 10 seconds, there shouldn't be that much difference, as 1 second is standardized.
Of course
7http://xkcd.com/391/
/me 7flees
Lol.
Because to a third observer, they are perceiving time as passing at the same rate, even if they might be perceiving it differently
O_o
How can they perceive time at different rates?
its really complicated
Why would someone see a second as passing faster than someone else?
It could be possible, but near-impossible to prove
okay.. if you flew past someone really fast, as you passed they seem to go slower than normal
But if what Arti and I had experienced is anything to go by, possible
hai guest
Time Dilation
/me pokes someone
Tell me then, what rate does a camera perceive time at, when it records a film?
07Hm
07Sorry for being so idle
07Im observing
the rate you percieve it as recording
07Dont feel like debating so..
rbr laundry dryng time
07Havent seen you in a while.
04Where's arti?
out
07Away it seems
aparently
07She's got guests over
07:>
What, so the clip would seem faster to some people than it would for others?
04I still never got an apology from her.
Well that doesn't really matter, because it's the same ammount of time either way, both would spend the same ammount of time watching it, whether one thought it was quick, or slow.
it depends on their concept of time, it might be ma mere fraction of a second's difference
And people always perceive time as going slowly when bored, and quickly when having fun.
07IRC and online time takes less priority so if you want to have a better chance at getting her at a convenient time, and when she's actually here these two days are out-ish.
07Anyway
07Lol though I havent followed the time perciev ing debate so I don't have anything to say XD
I just can't see how it matters either way, as it's the same ammount of time, whether you think it has gone slowly, or quickly.
hi
hi
So? Perception of time still has no affect on that.
07Welcome back-
04Internet died on me...
.....truth is Ive not really got a 100% clear idea of how it works
04yo...
07Ah
07Did you get my message?
Hello,
07Hey o.o
And why is the fact that rubber bends when you put a weight on it an example of why space bends? You say that space is not a true vacuum, which means there is still some gas in space, or what? Well that means dropping a mass into space, would displace this gas equal to the mass of whatever you put in space, but how does this 'bend' space, which is still nothing. The gas is displace, but you can't bend nothing.
07Who be you?
07Ok
04what message?
07[16:41:54] IRC and online time takes less priority so if you want to have a better chance at getting her at a convenient time, and when she's actually here these two days are out-ish.
07said this in the public chan, but you pinged shortly after.

07O.o
02o.o?
07I cant wait to talk to Arrow XD
So where are we now?
anyone here have platinum that could do me a favor?
07I want to tell him about this really disturbing dream I had
02........
its involving a trade
i wanna trade...
Space is not a real vacuum, as in that there's a few scattered particles here and there
Giratini
for...
particles, ok.
a level 2 magicarp
The particles are displaced.
But that doesn't bend anything?
There are always particles.
They bend things slightly
07Crap
07Lol
wb
Individually
Why would it bend things?
/me needs to watch her language at times
But enough of them will bend space big-time
If that's the case, why doesn't displacement of particles on Earth bend space?
07Anway hi Umbreon!
Even interstellar space has about three molecules per cubic centimeter. Almost all of which are hydrogen.
02hi
It does. By tiny bits we don't notice
why are we talking about bending space lol?
And even in a complete, total vacuum... you still have virtual particles popping into existance and back out.
Ah, yes that
...That doesn't make any sense, what is it that you are saying bends when you say 'bending space'?
Space physics is really crazy.
"bends" possibly being a metaphor
When I first read all of this, I was like,
Space itself is nothing. It is not the particles in space, they are just something IN space, not part of space.
"... this is madness!"
yeah
Space is some sort of nasty mathey manifold that only cosmologists understand.
ok so what about "time"
But then the facts screamed "THIS. IS. PHYSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICS!
back at me.
/me hides
07lol
Lol.
But yeah, it's boggles the mind
/me runs away in confusion, scared because he is not understanding anything , scared to be a outcast
07prince dari you are a tasty pickle
lol
I've seen the equasion for modeling even the simple bend around a point mass. G m1 m2 r^-2 it is not.
XD
07I dont get it either, but they like to discuss things
I can't remember it. It took up several lines, and had a lot of calculus symbols in.
Lets talk about doing backflips on a tricycle
Don't worry. I expect very few people to understand all of these
lol
07Welcome back
omg i hate my computer
/me smashes everyone with a Dedede hammer because he accidently pressed the X button on his internet...
I can't understand the concept of what you are saying, unless someone explains to me what they mean by 'bending space'.
04can space be bent?
bending space could be a possible metaphor...?
OK, imagine this.
What happened to light traveling in straight lines? O_o
/me implodes with all the sciency talk that he doesn't understand...
a glass prisim bends light
a easy example
It refracts it.
A cubic box. It's all rectangular-ly and stuff in normal space
To me bend, means curves.
/me calls upon Dialga and Palkia to pwn all space-time talk
Light does travel in straight lines. But straight lines might bend.
refracting is bending
07PM
As in, it stops it being in a straight line.
But if I bend the space around it, it might appear distorted
Yes
*cough*
It may take on a slightly curved shape
Or things like that
/me yawns
*cries* they stole dawns pokedex *cries*
Space is not euclidian. It's just close enough that you usually don't have to worru about it.
It's like how some kind of glass can refract the light coming in from outside, making them appear distorted
Two lines can both be straight, and yet intersect at two points.
can we stop with all the space talk
Hmmm?
"I can't understand the concept of what you are saying, unless someone explains to me what they mean by 'bending space'."
You need to pwn Palkia to stop us from talking about space
/me hides
Or both be straight, and parallel, and yet still intersect... and there is nothing wrong with a triangle in which all the angles do not add up to 180 degrees.
Because they are on a sphere.
All the rules of geometry they teach in schools only apply in euclidian space.
If we draw a large-enough triangle on Earth, that can happen.
It's the same princible in space, even when you can't see the sphere. Except rather than a 2d surface on a 3d sphere, you're looking at a 3d volume on a >3d thingie.
lol
Just with one master ball? :P
/me got lucky in the lottery, he's never hacked master balls, maybe pokemon, but not master balls.
oo
07Eh
If you put your arm through bended space, your arm might look funny if you are viewing it from unbended space, somehow
It may bend impossibly, look smaller, or larger
And anything you put into it will have the same effect
You can also bend space by spinning something really big and assymetric, really fast.
if you have played portal, that kinda like bending space, but bending it to create a instantanious tunnel
Do it right and you can spin of gravity waves.
/me is reminded of how the upper deck front windscreen on one of the double-deck bus models in his country distorts images when you look out through it.
Because the windscreen is very curved
Similarly, if space is bended enough things will look distorted
But that's only because of the way the windscreen affects light, is it the same in space, or is the object actually bent?
I'm not sure about that, but if you can remove it to unbended space, it will seem normal again
Hm.
At least that's what my knowledge is telling me
its impossible to tell
No one knows right now, but it may be possible that space is a sphere
And why does displacement of particles in space cause space to bend?

hi Altair
03My friend said I can get my Tron DVD back from him
03As he borrowd it, and we wanted to watch it at camp
03THis weekw as cool though
2hai
03We had some preteens so we couldn't watch PG-13 movies (frickin 9 year olds >_>) so we watched Spaceballs
13They actually bothered to put Tron on dvd?
03And my boss had the same thinking I did
2gotta*
03"This movie isn't appropriate at all... but if parents ask, it IS PG"
03so the kids liked it
03they laughed harder than any audience I"ve seen
03and yes, Tron is such a sweet movie
13Lol
03The reason I want to show it at camp: All the kids play this game called Armagetron
03That's basically the light-cycle game
03we do preteen tournaments
03so I thought it would be cool to teach them where that came from
03Most kids don't know, and heck, my boss didn't know either
03I mean epic in the sense that it makes anyone anywhere watch the video whether the content sucks or not XD
2Linkin Park is epic
03I had a bunch of 9-12 year olds... their projects weren't that good
03but people were turning their attention to the screen
03it was quite entertaining :)
'-'
hi Kipi

2somwhataskew: does thunderstorms scare you?
does thunderstorms?

13They always make the electric flash off for just a second, then this crappy computer takes forever to restart!
lolol
07well
I've never actually had that problem during a storm
07maybe you should move
07to california
07so I can sit on Cynder
13But besides that, I actually dont mind thunder
2lol
07you mean lightning
07X3
lol
I like the lightning and the rumble that follows :P
13I think I'll pass on that whole earthquake thing
07earthquakes are fun though
07it's not like a big one comes around much anyways lol
13I do mind lightning, smarty-pants. Its the thunder I dont mind

07we almost never get lightning here
07and if we do it's always cloud to cloud
2Feather: I'm already used to thunderstorms, so I'm not afraid of them
13That must be nice
2I was afraid of them in the past though
13I'd only be scared if I was outside with no shelter
07fear of stars is siderophobia.....

06:D
07thanks
07How is you lot?
7Probably because of the dissonance between the Caramelldansen earworm in my head and the darkness and comedy of a certain fanfic. o_o
I'm all right

06You know, before you ask.
06Blarg.

03God, you suck.

03It's meant as a showcase video, don't worry about what I called it LOL
7Nya?
06Bleed It Out be a good title~
06<3
03When you show a video on a projector to an audience, it doesn't need a title!
06So is A Place For My Head.
06Well, not the title so much. XD
03a place for my fist in your head?
03Um

06LAWL~
07when it comes to Linkin Park.
07Ahh.
07Cool.
/me jumps to Lying From You just because
03The thing is that Realm Crafter is such stupid software, it has 15000 things that make it crash
06<3~~~
03We even had two kids lose their projects halfway in
03and had to start over
07XD
03because of how bad the software is

03That's clearly mIRC
03look at the TV
/me pokes High Voltage multiple times

06XD
03because lyrics suck
/me 13hasn't listened to Castles in the Sky for ages now o3o
13I'm always listening to Dam Dadi Doo now |D
06That's because you listen to the wrong kind of music.
06D:<
10If music sells because it contains swearing
7oh,sorry
06D=
10then it fails to a level beyond human understanding
7Anime in a nutshell, by PrincessPeachie
/me will eventually have to make Hanim's Land Forme
Lol, that was nice timing.
Ok, thanks.

/me randomly hugs everyone

/me doesn't hug back randomly! Hugs back intentionally!

06I'm not.
06D=
07You are by going on about uit
06There's just...
07THEN linking videos.
03Either say it or use GTSDll
06Nothing wrong with it, really.
06They're just words.
06Lawl~
07It's against the rules here
03Failure @ not using winamp anyway
10They're long and tempting words you can press.
07To swear, and promiting it.
03Youtube IS NOT A MUSIC SITE
03Go to fricking www.imeem.com
06The whut?
03It's better quality AND Usually it's not censored
03and it also uses less CPU
03since it's not videos
07Such as swearing
07You might not like it but still.
07O
06>v>
07*I'm sorry but that doesn't go well with me. You've been warned.

07I'm getting really fed up with you at this rate.
07Don't push it.

07Now you're just being disruptive and disrespectful.
LOL. "We speak by two fram animation".
I love that bit.
06I thought I was always like that? X3
07Enough is enough.

07One last note. I'm not going to say, stop being who you are Cynder, but just tone it down a bit.
07And try to contribute to conversation everyone can participate in. That's all :>
07Anyway
03Haha LOL

13There's a fly in the room.. and it keeps flying into my computer screen D< And when I try to catch it, it simply dodges and flies away...mocking me D:
13It'll probably come back in a couple of minutes for a second round >>
07Wow o.o
07I hate buzzing insects
10Damnit, they always enter my room when i'm supposed to sleep.
10that sucks
10So yes, i hate them as well.
13A fly once tried tapdancing on my nose at about 4am in the morning when I was sleeping
07Oh dear
07did you kill it?
13My first reaction was to kill it, but it must have flown away because I ended up hitting my own face instead D:
07I hate it when that happens
07ugh O_o sounds painful
03bbl, I'm gonna install some new and better RAM in my computer..
hiiii
07Hey
07Ok
07Baiii
13RAM, I need some of that D:
Woah, a bloated fish.

^(joke)
10lol
13o.o oh wow, it's only 10:38pm
13I could've sworn it was about midnight
10it's not even midnight here, lol
Woo, someone from the UK.
it's 03:39 where I am
GUESS WHERE I AM
13in a house?
I'm in a bungalow.
Which is a type of house?
10:o
10i cba even thinking at all right now
13You are never not thinking :3
13Unless you're dead Â¦3
10:<
10XD
A foo? O_o
WE ALL KNOW BUNGALOWS ARE NOT HOUSES
DON'T THEY TEACH YOU KIDS ANYTHING AT SCHOOL ANYMORE?
>:(((((((((((
Nope.
gosh darnit
They sit there and spend 7 hours telling us how stupid we are.
13^ this
and so they should
it's character-building
07Not yet
10xD
The funny thing I noticed about my art grades was that I got the highest possible for the whole of this year, then they suddenly dropped when my art teacher found out I wasn't taking art.
13I want to drop textiles to take double art lessons, but my textiles teacher is all "but you're so good at it, there's no point.. you just need to stop being lazy and work on catching up more"
13it doesn't matter if I'm good at it or not, if I don't like textiles and aren't going to follow it as a possible career in the future, why should I carry on with it >>
Yep.
10lol
gradezzzzz
10Really, just say you don't want it, if he/she even try to persuade you he/she's retarded
10as you said yourself, it's your life
children should be beaten, not listened to
10lolwut
I'm only making a point. :-(
13If they still don't let me drop textiles, I'll just go on strike and not do any work in the lessons Â¦3 to prove that I'm being serious
surely if you were *forced* to do it, not doing the work would onlt be spiting yourself?
10lolxkcd, must click
It's apparently a science joke.
kepler
i should
10lol
but i don;t
I think it's a dude called Johannes Kepler or something.
10kepler...
hey if Arti shows up again today, poke me in PM okay?
13I don't get it o.o
If it isn't that, I don't know anyfink about it.
10LOL i sort of know who it is, but i can't recall
Mr. Kepler makes exceedingly good imitation cakes.
13I got that xD
07Quilava ok
07Im not sure she will
07Shw has people over
07I need to talk to her aswell..
07DRF and I agreed on bringing something up
07More information on that won't be discussed though :) before I get to talk to her
that's teasing
07Yep ;D
oh
Lol?
I love this slap script
10D:
/me steeples fingers and cackles
it's all either science, maths or something else
Not all of it.
10in other words
10either it's funny, or desperately unfunny
13I still don't get it :D
the unfunny ones are either serious or obscure
like the centripetal force one
10true
I wouldn't find it funny, but we've just done centripetal force in A2 Physics.
And a lot of it is mathematics, which I'm sure is a billion times more obscure.
http://xkcd.com/435/ <--- I like this one
13Somehow I just reminded myself of a slightly inappropriate joke I read in a book once
LOL
10lol
lol
to be honest I would say physicists are on top, becuase they have to show how maths fits into the real world :C
and a lot of physicists did lots of maths
like Newton invented calculus
10true really.
10http://xkcd.com/55/
10lol
I would say that mathematicians are like the direct opposite to philosophers
and physics is somewhere in the middle
but that's probably cos I am le tired
Lol, I've seen that video.
hmm
So go take a nap, BF. :P
d/dx
I don't know what that is
but it would just mean x[loveheart]
I think
and no
sleep is for the weak
Ok, then fire the missiles.
d/dx was part of either the chain, product or quotent rule. can't be more specific though, did it a while ago
good night everyone
i seeee
/me 7feels like she would rant any moment
?
7Blame a mix of internet, TPBoD, talent, and yaoi.
What is this TPBoD you keep talking about?
07Okay.
07I like feesh
07can you help me find out of one thing? Why is it that so many people like yaoi anyway? I know this might be stretching it a little but I mean it as a serious discussion topic
Oooook...O_o
10internet, TPBoD, talent and yaoi
10oh dear
07Arrow's told me several times that all girls like that sort of stuff o.o; and I don't, though I'm curious why he keeps saying it.
07:p
07Lol
7The 'actual' title of TPBoD is The Rengades, but TPBoD fits more in my other anagrammed fanfics: ASoM and TLS. :P
http://xkcd.com/591/
7Yush, yaoi is strange, but unfortunately, that's a part of TPBoD. Not that I read it for that, 'course: I find the themes and character development scintillating.
10Yaoi....
10no comment
LOL
BF: LOLOLOL
10LOLOLOL
7Note: Do NOT look up silvestris's art. o3o
10HAHAHA OH WOW
lol
10I can handle the "OH GOD" of the images, i just find yaoi to be ... well, silly
10wait a sec... reminds me of something btw
i find the amount of people who seem to like it mildy odd
10@ BF's link
07Why is it likeable though?
07that's what I wonder
/me 7shrugs
10Because it's boys and the internet works that way.
10Anime boys.
7But, wow, I find it strange that TPBoD mixes yaoi, drama, and comedy in one.
7Especially chapter 13.
*^__________^*;;;;; ~~~
10rage
7Oh, and 12. Or was that 11?
lots of books have slightly adult themes
like The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant :D
bah. bored.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant,_the_Unbeliever
you can haz
they're very good books
like TLotR in sort of scale
10:O
but uh, not the same
i.e. TCoTC has lepers
:D
07LOL
10and that makes it better? awesome.
http://xkcd.com/163/
yeah
Ugh -v- bloody bluescreens
/me 7actually snickered IRL from the OOC-ish-ness of chapter 16.
see, the protagonist is actually... human
i.e.
not OMG GOOD or OMG EVIL

07Im on my channel mostly now
/list
03Stupid connection
03Anyway, bbl
/me 7is on Chapter 19 of TPBoD.
7Out of 83 total chapters. X3
07wow
07o.o
/me is still here, just partially dead
/me 7is checking how many words there are per chapter.
7Hmm, between 2k and 4k words a chapter, times 83...
7 166,000 - 332,000 words in total.
07LOL Quilava
7My, that's a lot. o3o
LOL
7And MY, that's thrice-to six and 1/2 times more the length of a traditional novel.
/me 7decides to stop reading at chapter 20.
/me squeaks
7Hey!
7I've just noticed:
7The limit for a post is 20k words, but I can't post mine even though it's 19810 words! D:
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJGA3SCH8E8 Oh, and btw
Wow...
7Sorry, not words, characters.
6Smooth Criminal! :D
6o-o;; SORRY!!! Wrong channel!
/me 7blinks
07And yeah I'm in #fire_island atm, mostly, this channel is way too quiet XD
7So... if only someone could fix that.
07I mean ever since I poked Cynder it calmed down
07Hm
07Which forums?
07the site ones?
7Yush.
rawgh.
07I'll mention it to artee
07:)
I think I'm gonna go deaf <.<;
6howcome?
07^v^
07Welcome to here
Hey, thanks.
07Woah your IP is long o_O I just noticed.
07[01:09:46] <Quilava> greaat, a bunch of my bro's friends are in here <- How many are they?
um
5 total.
all in this room >.>
Is it? O_o
07Or well, join address thing
Meh, that's a hostname. :P
07Oh. XD; *computer-fail*
XD, and yeah, it is pretty long.
07Well, alright :> Everything's sort of quiet around here.
07I wonder why, the main channel isn't usually this quiet. O.o
you could share some of the loud and obnoxious over here <.<;
they're freaking loud..
07Ah
07I'm just reading articles again
I feel like I'm in some crap internet chatroom.
07Oh what are they saying?
07Out of curiosity
stupid internet shit
07Like?
07lol
/whois Quincunx
um. everything <.<;
/whois Quilava
anything stupid on the internet, they talk about it
07LOL 4chan, ED, odd things...? Lol
yes.
...Eurgh, 888chan.
Fail.
anything followed by 'chan' sucks
07Pretty much.
and guess what? they're all around the food.
I'm afraid to go get something to eat
Sometime, I have to DDoS 4chan, 888chan, and ED.
that's not a good move >.>
07I don't like ED at all.
Why's that?
07I can ignore the chan's.
They can't do anything to me.
you sure about that?
Yep.
well hey, if you want, go ahead.
A group of us from a SPYRO fan forum completely destroyed them when they tried to 'raid' us.
yeah, but trust me. it won't just be net raids if you really piss them off
How are they going to get my address?
I wouldn't know, but they've done it
IP tracing? That's only so accurate, and I always use proxies, so it pointless anyway.
The truth is the can't do anything.
07arf
they*
right.. then go ahead
The only problem is that DDoSing them is probably illegal.
I have no idea what ED iss, but proxies or not, I'm pretty sure you're not nearly as secure as you think
Probably?
I am.
lol
The only info they can get from me if what I post on the internet.
The ONLY way I can get spyware from them is if I download something from them.
I'm not going to do that.
7meep
If you know half as much as you're implying, you know how weak that statement is from most people
What people daily post to the internet
Is a goldmine of information
If you know how to use it
And to connect the dots
Well you should see how much information you can get from me in a day.
It won't be much to go on.
Perhaps, but I'm not really into the information gathering, I kind of like the puzzles of it, and I can see how things connect together quickly
But I prefer to leave people's private lives well enough alone
if they can get your IP at all, they can find and get information from any other site you visit.
They 'DOX' people, which is their term for getting info on people, I spammed the hell out of many of their sites, and trolled their message boards, and they didn't get ANY info on me.
I was actually kind of disappointed.
/me pokes a mod
if you're that certian about this, you can go ahead, I'm not stopping you.
07arf
but if they do start getting crap on you, don't bring them here.
6Spammish threads: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3801.msg140037;topicseen#msg140037 AND http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3802.msg140041;topicseen#msg140041
As I said, I'm pretty sure it would be illegal.
if you can't be traced like you say, why should that matter?
So, I'm not planning on doing it.
The government can trace you.
if the government can, so can other people
Nope.
how does that work?
They can, only because they can ask your ISP.
thanks
Aero's here
and whats to keep people from hacking the ISP to get the information?
Your ISP will only give your info to the police.
Aero: rawr
They would have to be extremely proffesional, which none of them are.
07slap her
Aero: D:
7AERO
and what if you happen do piss off the police? who knows what they do in their spare time
Aero: QUAN
...How would I piss off the police?
/me 7is currently reading TPBoD, and is at a Zexion chapter. Like you care. X3
07Uh..
what if they're frequents to whatever site you attack?
Aero: XD
...There's loads of what I'm sure is illegal crap on those sites.
07Highly improbable though
I doubt any non-corrupt policeman would go on them.
/me 7then ponders if there are any Zero fanfics.
Aero: Mah feet hurt. >:
Aero: there's liek.... one. XD
7I find it a bit peculiar that all of the 'good' XIII fanfics have Vexen as a main character. Then again, I only have one in my uppermost tier of canon-connecting, eloquently stylized, plot-theme invoking fanfic.
Aero: What's 'canon'?
7In-storyline. :P
07official storyline
Aero: ah, okay
...oh crap... I HAVE to sleep in tomorow.
ugh
Aero: D: Why? Something happen?
brother has 4 friends sleeping over
Aero: oh. D: Sounds like a bit of trouble.
07ew
yeah.. I can't come out here till they're all awake.
and who knows how late they'll sleep in <.<;
7Huh, this is the only fanfic I've ever read that scenes actually appear in my mind (except for, well, y'know. O_o). Other times, it's just auditory sensations. o.O
Corrupt or not, it's still a policeman.
/me is sleepy
7OH, MEEP. Chapter 24. Titanic refereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeence! X3
/me is starving.
07go get foods
trying
o.o
bah, timing = fail
AGAIN
You are trying to go get food?
yeah
07you should poke her
...
D:<
/me slaps Kyu
Aero: XD
07hey
Cosmi! Can!
07it's not my fault
If anyone can!
07Aero's the one who's going to poke you
07you should poke her
Aero: XD
...
she poked me
D:
07well
and i did poke her
07maybe you should lock her out in the backyard
she would just walk back home
Aero: yesh. or flail. O:
07well that's why you lock the yard doors too
07duh
they can't be locked
well
they can
but they open on the inside
07use a combination lock
hehe
Aero: D:
6No journal in DA or in the forums is that word XD
Aero: Maybe I can climb the fence? XD
Aero: o: Why do they leave so quickly?
07nah
07you don't have the upper body strength
/me squeaks
Aero: XD True, that's true. XP
*Aero huggles Quil~ :D
/me squeaks and hugs back
Aero: I haven't completed a set of monkey bars since 3rd grade. XP
07lol
7Okay, I just had a STRANGE thought: TPBoD as... well... erm, yeah. (Blah for thoughts about something nobody else knows! X3)
07I can stand on the ground when i'm on monkey bars >.-.>
Aero: 'cause your a tall person. o:
Aero: and tall ppl can cheat. o:
07Oh
07I'm here
07I just died
07Sorry
07LOL
07Kyu
07Arrow used some monkey bars when he was here
07:D
07but feather's can't grip....
07Bleh
07I need to eat more often
bah. same.. ><
or just more in general.
he did them UPSIDE DOWN
Aero: O: My parakeet used to do that
hullo
Aero: Imma go now. O: bai pplz~
7AERO D:
i need to eat less often
x_x
o.o;
bai D:
You need to eat when you're hungry >=[
07I just dont find food very apetizing or however you spell it, and always put it off
I'd say the same.....but I can eat and eat without worry, for some reason I NEVER put on weight.
07There are times where I'll ravenously pounce food and eat like the worst pig ever
O.O;
07But that's rare nowadays
Well, if I wanted to. But you should eat when you are hungry and not forget >.<
i think food is amazing.
but i work in the food business. >_>
KYUK
-K
KYUUUUUUUUU
LOOK OUTSIDE
IT'S RAINING
8D
07I think I need to make it tastier. I think the food I have is too bland, and that's why I don't want to eat.
-v-;
So, there we have it
yes. if you're going to eat, eat healthy amazing tasting food.
You need to meet burd
imma burd.
precisely.
Buy something new and interesting?
And have burd cook something for you
07Tavy I might try to do that
Also you are coming to merry UK soon so maybe you will find more interesting things here
Speaking of food, glas, so you'd recommend pan-cooking the alligator?
I was going to grill it
07Tavy, anything you can recommend?
oh healthy+good is pretty easy
just make it flavourful
using spices and sauces
07I just had some cereal and I was all 'gruh' because I didnt want much after the first spoonful, but forced it down since I can't go another 24 hours without foods
07which I would've done if I hadn't eaten now
What type of cereal?
Curry could be a healthy+good thing.
because i love spicy foods
and YES CURRY
07Yeh!
IS GOOD
CURRY
Curry is amazing
07loooooooooool icarly
i like indian foods
7...
and
asdf
all foods ;________;
spicy food though. epic.
7Wow, chapter 24 has over 8,000 words. O_o
07I like chinese foods recently oddly enough
07that smoothie guy is selling pickles on a stick
07XD
/me runs
I like Japanese curry better than Indian curry <_<;;
07and no LOL no arrow references, can't blame him really lol
7Nearly 40,000 characters.
i like all curry
indian curry, thai curry, MONKEY CURRY
Hmm, you're shipping something
And suggest.....hmm, I dunno tbh. My favourite dinners are things I think you can get anywhere like beef stew and such.
Is there anything you could cook
no limer
That would survive the traveling?
it takes weeks
for things to arrive
LOL
weeks and weeks
07Tavy!
07I was wondering
Nothing that would survive that at all?
my mum makes fantastic beef stew. <3
Hmm?
no, because i'm talking about soups
07Fish and chips any good?
or .. anything that isn't dry and packaged
ovo;
OvO;
ALTEH
MAH BURD.
07are you afraid of pickles?
07XP
07I'm possibly going to Canada in December
I was wondering something as well actually......and depends. It is good if you can find a good place to buy it from.
07then Leeds next summer
Leeds!
You should meet in Leeds
07Both trips I have to pay for myself and I'm unemployed x.x
i intend to go to you
Chapter 24 has ALMOST 9000!!!! words

07Ah ok.

SHAREH.

IT SHALL HAPPEN.
This is burd we're talking about
4,14ALMOST 9000?!
She'll manage it

07I could try learning how to cook actually for myself
07the food mum makes is starting to bore me, I really need variation..
meeting in leeds would be fun harhar, yorkshire accents are soo lovely *__*
burd is making a gumbo video
About making gumbo

07[02:15:35] <Tavy> I was wondering something as well actually......and depends. It is good if you can find a good place to buy it from. <- What do you wonder about tavy?
/me slaps Kyu around a bit with a large trout
/me is ashy!
/me 7blinks
/me applies lotion
Although when I'm on the computer, I often forget to eat. XD
...So I'm gunna go eat now.
BRB.
07kay lol
/me dies x_x
Good, you shouldn't eat at your computer
7But I have to say, excluding its length, Chapter 24 is my favorite chapter so far. :D
I didn't eat about three days ago
07Oh Tavt
All day
07*y
07Er
/me 7stops reading TPBoD; she'll read the next 59 chapters sometime later. o3o
Unless it is an admin thing.
07Anyone know how to change the font colour on chatzilla?
Hmm, in chatzilla?
07I has a colourscript but that's for mIRC
07Yeah
Tales of Flame has over 300 chapters.
I think it's just a button preference somewhere
07I can't find it, I don't use that client at all.
dayum
7 365 or Bust! has (you guessed it, 365 chapters). :P
Okay
o.o;
07Oh!
cool
%C02,04This is cool text
07I forgot LOL Sorry Tavy
a chapter a day
for a year
From what I'm seeing @ Tavy
hallo
07thanks for the reminder
Hehe :P
07LOL limer that doesnt change the colour
http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/faq/#colors
2hi altair
10HI
It does from what it says here
2FEATHER
But you have to use the command /pref outgoing.colorCodes true
7CR, how long are those chapters?
First
2hikyu
I'm not sure.
Been a while since I've read it.
It's not finished yet, either.
o-o
0442 test
7Hmm. The ones from TPBoD vary from a few paragraphs, to as I mentioned, >8,000 word ones, JTLYK.
012 Hmm, better
>.<
You need to use 00-15
ANd you need the 0 in front of the single digits
To make sure it works
/me 7curiously questions over the conclusion of the fic.
012
012 It works but it doens't stay so I won't use it
Or not, ah well
Yeah you'd have to script it in to stay, I think
/me 7AFKs; she's been on the computer for WAY too long.
It's 1:23 am here, and food was put on the table at around 9-10 pm.
/me is eating strawberry pocky
..or i wait so long, the food is all put away
"hay, where's the pasta?"
"we had that 4 hours ago."
"oh."
I don't like eating. :P

And on that page there is a link to another thing, so you think "Oh, I wonder what that is/that looks interesting/etc", and click on that page, and on that page you come accross another link, then another, etc, ettc.
6Oh! That happens to me all the time! XD

02[20:24:44] <Kyu> want one of my togepis with nasty plot?
02what's the catch kyu? lol
/me noms on Pockyu
02they have horrible IVs in one stat?
07actually
07scratch that
07i thought I had a male that could pass it on
males can pass ivs
02i'm just going to hack a togekiss with 31 in every IV
cant pass natures.
02give it all the moves i need and breed it with a ditto with all 31 IVs
LOL
XD
I could hack you a nice 31 ditto
want it?
07but to get nasty plot onto a togepi requires you to egg move it twice
hacking for breeding's sake = m'kay
:O I actually HAVE a sore back atm due to work >.< so a massage would be good
Aww :(
02o.o
02poof
07well not if you give them perfect ivs lol

06Cybits make cute chirping noises and love to spin round really fast. << Holy crap.
06I should kill it.
06D=
But it wouldn't effect voiced users in any case
07you can't get body slam unless you migrate
Ah
06Or unless you use the TM?
02i see
And it wouldn't effect you anyway
7Well, I'm patient, Sharry. :3
06Isn't it a TM?
Since you're +o
06I'm not.
06D=

And nice to meet you btw, Tavy
6OH!!!!!!!! BURN!!!!

07O.o; What?!
07LOL
6In mythbusters =P
Whut. WHUT.
/me is shot
6Well, they dropped a car from 4000 feet, and to Kari, it was more exiting than her ferst kiss! XD
lol
06Rawr.
07lol Umbreon
07now that I think about it
06>|3
03So hah.
07it's kinda odd that I didn't see an uproar user in the tournament
lol
07that would mess up so many smeargle users
02seemed people wanted to use their berries instead
03Hmm...
03Alabriss or Cybit?
07oh
07and Umbreon
07if the togekiss is for doubles
07give it Heat Wave
7Altachuck, Cynd. :P
03No.
07LOL
02hmm
07My first kiss was so unromantic :<
/me doesn't have one ATM and doesn't feel like paying for one
02heatwave over aura sphere?
7Ulq: I can give you one for free.
02i see where you are getting
03No thanks.
03Besides, I don't think it'd go well with Flame_Okami.
07we were in a room with like 5 others and i was seated on his lap and he was warm, and I felt like kissing him, so after a bit of me being affectionate I just did. He was very soft though
03She's an Xweetok.
02honestly but togekiss is becoming one of those "come on i need like a 15 move limit going on here" kind of pokemon
03*a
03Not an.
07I felt horrible after since i was in a relationship at the time but LOL that relationship was doomed so I dont know why I had such a guilty conscience >.> <.<
/me says it as "Ex weetok" for some reason
07since the guy pretty much asked me if it was ok if he somehow ended up sleeping with another girl
/me coughs
O_o
.....wow that is bad.
07lolwut
o_o
/me 7blinks
07altachucks are insanely cheap
07Lol Tavy my ex was a bit odd
:/
7I pronounce it with the same X as in Marluxia's name.
wier
wierd*
07That relationship was so fail toward the end it's a wonder I didn't end it before he did
7Scweetok. :P
07btw
07I met arrow a month after or so lol
07thing is he ended up going for that girl he wanted to sleep with
07can someone on neo buy me the book "Faerieland Clouds"?
07and they're still together today
07FOUR OH FOUR
07FAILTIME
07!!!!!!
07/end
I suspect it can be tricker to end a relationship sometimes than it is even starting one.....I'd imagine anyways.
not for everyone
7Zomh, 40k NP?
07Tavy, wrong.
07is it?
/me hugs everyone
7Ah, another part of Neopets has it at 30k.
07hm
07wait
/me will buy it for Kyu :3
*Shrug* Can't say I am experienced in these things.
07Tavy actually, I was in denial about liking arrow for longer than I can remember
07what's the water faerie's reward again?
03Uh..
07don't yet lol
/me hugs everyone here, too
7I wouldn't recommend it:
07Thing is I had a whole list of people who tried to get my attention in the romantic sense
7A codestone could easily get you that stat boost for a much cheaper price.
make them take turns saying nice things to you
and charge them >=D
07While I had to get over my ex, as well as fighting off a strong crush on another friend who I turned down - Arrow showed up on a very inconvient time
/me doesn't get it, then
It reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly depends on the person though
07and the way he acted... I really didnt want to like him o.o
Arrow tends to do that
/me RUNS
07LOL
07I guess so!!
07But
What was he like then?
Hehe
07Horrible
02well here we go
07Yet intriguing
07I tried to keep him away from me though LOL because I was SO uncertain about him
07so we fought a lot
07But
o.o
07I remember countless hours spent with Lugia_Seagull where I either ranted, damned him to hell for being alluring, and came to terms with my feelings
07Slowly
o.o;;;
alluring, lol
07I really didnt want to like him .. that was like, from january-july
07it's a Roara!
07then we had that fight and stoof and became enemie suntil I was all '
07I miss you
ROARA!
/me sits on her
hi Aurora
ty Quil ^^
RAWRA!
oo
02well kyu
/me rawrs~
02now i have 995 of every berry
07and ... in August, I pretty much admitted my feelings. not directly but indirectly, yet it took me until sept. 28 to make up my mind that I wanted to be together with him in the end
07so uh
07LOL
7RORA
7*late*
o_O
/me just randomly bought an Altachuck
07Long complicated story is long and complicated
O_o
/me squeaks and hugs back
03Because.
07looool
03|D
02kyu
07i have like....20
07you get them free lol
02i'm going to hack the heck out of platinum
umbreon
02just to get the non-hacked pokemon i need
03Where, Kyu? |3
02then trade all the non-hacked to diamond and use diamond in nintendo tournaments XD
flash cart
or ar?
07complete the altador plot
/me bursts
02what they don't know won't hurt them
07lol
07Umbreon
7i offered you an altachuck for free, Ulq.
07Platinum is the one they use in tournaments
You are together now, regardless of the past. He hasn't changed much imo though in the time I have known him.
03Anyone want a Bottled Light Faerie?
02it's strictly platinum?
7ME. :P
03I bought one for no apparent reason.
07yep
Lol, neopets is so easy to hack. XD
02what about during regionals next year
/me 7'll take it. :3
7O_o
03Quan, I happened to find one in a store.
02heartgold and soulsilver will be out
03XD
7Hacking... Neopets?
07unless you live in a place where it doesn't exist lol
07it won't be out in english
Yeah, the results are REALLY funny.
HG and SS are dominating my mind O_O
02you're kidding
03There, Quan. |3
6Kyu, they should be out approx Aug-Nov of 2010
07Tavy, nope!
03It costed exactly 2,930 NP.
03That's actually very cheap.
03::D
07besides
02i guess sometime in the future
02i'll need to restart platinum
07i thought you already hacked the heck out of diamond
02and hack the heck out of diamond
02no
02diamond is untouched
07lol
Why do you need to restart platinum to hack diamond? O_o
03Quan, want some Lost Desert Eyeshadow?
02or else i can't get into nintendo tournaments lol
03Just because.
!lag
02if i use platinum
Oh.
02they'll know i hacked
02and i won't be able to get in lol
07well
07you can get it
07you'll just get kicked
07XD
Hmm, I have noticed a couple.
07Anything you can point out?
02kyu wouldn't that suck
All you need to do if remove the hacked bits which they can actually pick up on. :P
02they do the drawing
/me puts some stuff up for auction
02to see who gets into the tournament
07I'm just wondering if you can spot the same as I do ;>
03Starting at 1 NP.
02then like half the people who got in have hacked pokemon and get booted from the tournament
02the other half have diamond XD
I dunno :S 'Tis hard to explain.
O_o More work to reset the game, and start again.
07Haha
07I know what you mean, but I can name a few things
07and I can also see where some of his vocabulary rubbed off on me as well -v- lol
03Mage Spells, Lava Mote, and Altachuck.
03Because I was bored and people love cheap things. |3
That rubbed off on me >.< Though it was a combination of Althea, Munch and Arrow that did that.
/me pokes Quan's depressed pets
07Uh, what rubbed off on you? O.o
/me pampers his pets by giving them everything they need at a 4-star hotel
02kyu
7LolKyu.
02you have a fun way of bringing bad news
03The highest amount of NP I'll pay on a hotel is 80, so 4-star.
03D|<
7I don't really take care of them. X3
Grammar and vocabulary. I seem to use a few words he does now >.<
02i didn't want to hack diamond D:
02because i actually worked my butt off to complete the pokedex in that game
02without hacking
07lol
eon
AR?
07just pay for the cheapest one
02took me 210 hours :P
07for a whole month
03No.
03D|
02nah i'm not going to buy those flash things
03I want them to be happy.
02i guess i'll just buy pearl
02and hack pearl
02better yet
0380-NP hotel with everything checked for a month.
02hack diamond
07a month of the cheap one is cheaper than 2 days in the 80np one lol
02i need pearl for restarting
07you're wasting your points
02and catching azelf and heatran
07or

07I once remember I said 'what the flak', and his 'whiskey tango foxtrot' is another one
03and how you don't even know unless you read the lyrics
07>.>;
/me 6cares about the beat :|
07and that line above
/me coughs
03You could play it in front of a typical parent, and they wouldn't think the song is bad
03Yeah me too
03Beats > Words

Hey.

I just stay on all day. Lol.
( /nolife )
6Lol
9Wait...of you have no life, I can't kill you?
9*if
Yep.
I'm undead.
6I'm sick of getting in trouble every day and minute..D<
6WTF
7Hey.
/me 9gets chainsaw
7...Who gave abbey mibbit?!
6Ugh.there it is again.I htg now that it's alive
I thought she always used mibbit...?
6Lol
Because spyrochat.com is mibbit.
9[/fail]
7Not the actual thing. She used the spyrochat embedded thing
6XD
7Don't try and be a smart-arse dari. You do it so badly.
Not really, I know what I'm talking about more than you do.
6Anyways
6Bye everyone
Cya.
7That's not what I mean. Pulling things apart and taking technicalities just to make other people see you as more intelligent than them. It's really not necessary here, have you /seen/ most of these?
7cya C7
6I hope you'll all be on again tomorrow..>.<
6Bye
...No, you said who gave her mibbit, when spyrochat.com IS mibbit.
There is absolutely no difference between the interfaces.
06LAWL.
7Which is exactly my point. I meant /actual/ mibbit, not SR's paranoid version.
06This description is SO Kyu.
06"All the cool Neopets wear bow ties. Duh."
7Everyone else knew that, so you're either trying to make yourself look smarter, or you're an idiot.
9God, you guys are so desperate to start debates.
There's no difference between the two, so why do you think that going on mibbit from mibbit.com, and going on it from spyrochat.com makes any difference?
They are both the ACTUAL thing.
7with SR's version you can't join channels, which was SR's main reason for making it different.
You can.
I did it on SR's version.
7That's true but it's a total bitch switching between them, which is the main reason I switched to mibbit.com and most other people did.
7Regardless, whoever gave her mibbit.com, because I doubt she had the presence of mind to get it herself, has unleashed abbey on every other channel.
Abbey doesn't know how to join other channels.
7...true.
Lol.
7that was a wasted 5 minutes
Yep.

Heys

Uhh, okay?
Does she need anything?
14Oh!
14no LOL I thought you did
14but then
14I remembered that I was the one who needed to talk to her
14/memoryfail
12No
12I last went in May
I went around 6-7 weeks ago, did you go to see the opsreys?
/me sleeps
12Yes
Hello everyone
12So what date did you go?
12HAI CP :>
Hi Arti
12SHe is but a bit busy
I figured as much, thanks\
I didn't notice til recently that chapter 4 was the largest chapter I've written for my fic, 3,500 words isn't bad at all
/me thinks an early night is a good idea
I think we got there on the 25th of May.
Arti!
I'm unsure whether to go to bed or not XD
12lolz
On one hand I'm tired as heck (£10 on DDR in a row without a break is very tiring XD) and on the other hand I wanna stay and chat to everyone
07lol

Oh Arti I passed another 3 songs on Expert today :>
It was the 27th, I think.
My book is wet :(
14I am
14I just checked, was telling Arti something
14Before I forgot.
14LOL Vyl
14thats an odd line
I dropped it.
Hey, did you guys have a Wolfenstein battle yet?
I read in the bath...
O_o
Now it's wet and the pages are going wrinkley.

/me 6asplodes
6Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay, PLOT DEVELOPMENT :D
/me bursts
14I actually like that name o.o
=P
Was just wondering
Did schedule one for today, right?
/me exposes the book to high-intensity visible, IR and UV light. That should dry it.
12Sorry guys Im trying to talk to so many people at once
Tis fine
14Articuno
...if the others were up for a battle we could possibly bring Arti in, if she was interested...
14I can talk to you another time if you want.
12Signed a petition there too
Yeah, we donated some money.
14so I could chew on him
14Arti is lonely/tired, dunno if she's up for it but you could ask.
14Best leave her then, I'm not sure how well she's feeling
14I'm not too chipper myself really but -v- lol
14whatever, Im still up for it
12^^
/me flops
/me flops

X_X I'm soooo tired :(
14Are you up for a game of wolfenstein today?
14I know we said next sunday but Arrow got his dates mixed up..

14LUGIA
14WHEN DID YOU GET HERE XD
14Uhhh... XD
And a few minutes ago, was just pondering on how to make my entrance ;p
14Duh XD
6Okeys, tea is once again a trigger word for me. ovo
/me 6now has cake, sempai, and tea as trigger words. Say 'em if you dare. :P

12Only place you can see them regularly
butbut
/me 6is done.
inflated prices
Well, only place in England you can see NESTING ospreys. :P
so many tourists
12Yeh true :>
Hi ABbey
:D
12I don't like Lake District for that personally
6quiet night then
14Indeed.
12I much prefer Scotland, there's no tourists but instead you got biting midges, thousands ofthem
6See ya soon!
nothing annoys me more than having some stupid farmer trying to sell me food at stupid prices becuase tourists are willing to pay that money
12kk
6sometimes thats good though lol
In France we got attacked by some weird yellow super-mosquittoes (sp?) in a nature reserve.
14O__o
14was he suppsed to return it like 10 years ago?!
14LOL
14lol
or going into shops and seeing stuff at high prices
12That's the year I was born :O
And I don't WANT to know the fine XD
i mean, it's alright if you can afford it, but it generally just make a huge chunk of the county I live in quite inaccessible to the rest of us... :(
and there's not much else to do here ;n;
12Lol
12In Italy there's this thing called a banded mosquito I think, and it's really strong, I found one in England a couple of years ago, not good :/
not that there's anything wrong with tourists, it's just that they're dumb enough to pay theprices
But oh well, the book was worth 5.5 pounds back then ;>
14gah I typoed XD
/me is mosquito queen
...Queen? Lol.
And it is rather interesting that a lot of people here are over the age of 18 ;> Or 18 an over ;>
14Haharharha that book is older than me
14Nope.
well apparently everybody thinks i'm male
14:/
Apparently so.
14Lugia why's that interesting?
You are that's why BFlol
12Cos we are all old....
14She left before I came on again.
so I'm finding ways to point out that I'm not
14Darn it I better not be the youngest person on my own channel XD
:P
14Oh wait I'm not
He's a male at heart.
6ah gotcha ok
It is interesting, since one would assume the site is more for the younger generation, normaly people our age wouldn't even be considered for being interested in pokemon ;>
12I object! I know people older than me still interested in it.
14But this channel has no theme :P
14I like to have you here though ^v^
Tavy, I didn't say that it is true that only minors love pokemon, I only said it is expected ;>
12with knives and othe.....OOPS not allowed to go into detail with that part....
lol XD
12Lol, and yeah but when we grew up liking it, it sticks
Well, they are forcing me to be here with the birdie boiler in that corner >> *points*
i don't recall ever stating i was male, you know :C
10So, BF's not male? That surprised me as well, LOL
14Well, Arrow and I are awesome.
yeah
14Admit it.
10^^
14That's why you're all here ;D
you'll have all forgotten by the morning
/me brick'd
n.n
/me apologizes for also making that mistake, BF
/me nods vigerously *pokes sp* as he stares at the birdie boiler in horror
yw P:
12Haha lol
/me blames Lugia!
/me blames Lugia!
hhi
12ECCO!

14THOU CANST STEP ON A ROLLYBURDY
14Oo
/me explodes
Though can't step, but though can roll XD
12Hiya Lugia :>
/me rolls
So Tavy, welcome then, to one of the more interesting channels here ;>
Heya hey Articuno ^v^
Round...floofy? Wha?
lol...
BF seems to talk a lot of BS around here ^^'
12XDD
god damnit
12lolz
12It is interesting :)
BF's chosen gender is up to him, lulz
12case and point? *shhot*
/me runs
12*shot*
I'D HAVE NEARLY DONE IT TOO
12-* -_-
if it wasn't for your pesky uh
/me holds up his wings
i dunno
I said nothing ^v^
but it is slightly amusing to see how many people can believe you're of the opposite gender
my record is about a month, on another pokÃ©mon site o-o
12LOL
14If the others will PLEASE reply
14we could arrange something
12Hasn't Rex convinced people for a few years?
I get called 'he' sometimes here.
Well, all people have is the words you type, nothing else ;>
/me sits all over Lugia
/me gets called he and she :P
o_O
Better than being called 'it'
/me hands Kyu a super cookie ^v^
14o-o
07yaay
Actualy I wouldn't mind being called it ;>
12no, I like being called "it"
/me superdances!
12Lugia me, Xai and Nick picked up peadges today and Nick says it's the first time he's ever touched a bird LOL
12lol Arti
12Stick a comma in there
12I meant @ Lugia
~Articuno â€¢ Hasn't Rex convinced people for a few years? <-- i don't think he and Vicky tried to convince people as such
How did Nick react?
just changed their gender on their profile
could be wrong tho
... what?! Poor Nick... well, I am really glad he got to experience that with you two then, since you two undoubtly made it 150% more fun then it would have been XD
12Yeh I told him the softest place to stroke a peadge ^^
lol, well, want a free target? ;p
12[16:33] <Articuno> I meant @ Lugia >sorry, XD
erm people don't wanna know, Arti
/me runs
12FURFAGS XD
ovO Where is taht exactly...? on their chest...?
12Nope the neck
14Yes
I'd have thought neck...
Ah... I never noticed that to be honnest...
12We catch WAY too many birds
12Oh
Well, another young Peadge flew down our chiminey again today XD
12Guys
and gulls
12Nick had this great idea but dunno if it'll work..
12He's saying I should sell merchandise on TST
lol Lugia
lol... well, perhaps if I get the game some day I will join for a free target ;>
Awesome, that's a good idea.
12Like mousemats, mugs, posters etc. of Lugia and Articuno
12Since I don't have a job yet
That would be a great idea Arti!
I just remembered I slept last night with that giant Lugia looking at me
12I just wonder how many people would actually buy
12I would :D
I would
12I'd have to charge a lot to make a profit
12Hmm ok..
12Let me tell you how much for a mousemat then.
12roughly
14Ok XD
also I had about 20 Articunos looking at me as I slept last night
12LOL!!!!
/me grins
14LOOOL
14did you count?
12how much, Arti?
grrr a chav just tried to ask me out on Facebook >>;
What a rake.
Articuno, if you could sell specialised stuff, like an A3 mousepad with your Lugia Silver art, that I would buy XD
12A3?
14Articuno i don't know honestly
14LOL A3 is HUGE
O_O
A3???
Gamers use A3 mousepads ;>
lol
O______________________o
They are really nice...
which is why I want one ;>
12o.o
14haha!
Articuno, Bad idea.
12Why?
Remember that Articuno and Lugia are copyrighted Nintendo.
12so?
People sell their fanart all the time though on DA
The art is owned by Articuno rgoufg. :P
12can't shut me down for it
and FA
though*
Actually, they can.
Wow, that was a nice typo of though.
12there's someone at the door D:
it's nintendo
come to get you
12but Im kinda under dressed *is now scared*
12I can't move, they might hear me
They just have no reason to currently - you're just a fan site, doubt they even notice you.
It's probably someone wanted some sugar or tea
Nintendo hates its fans lol
Nintendo took about a year before they decided to do anything about flash carts.
Paranoid Arti? o.o
12No just.. who would knock on my door at 10pm??
14O.o
14Articuno
o_o
Me...? ;p
14speaking of being under dressed
12o.o
14I remember
12I cant open it anyway, unless I get dressed
14Once my brother forgot his keys and hammered the door and stuff because he heard someone home and demanded I open the door NOW and stuff, said it was him
12but then I'd wake up Xai
/me pets Arti
14i opened..
Vyl, what about all the people who sell commissions of people's pokésonas all the time or DA and FA? They don't get done for that.
14but
Ah yes, it's pretty late over there isn't it
14he forgot to say he had friends over so i was VERY under dressed...
14straight from the shower, most embarrassing moment ever
14z.z
I'm here <.<
I said before
Hey DRF.
Only because they arn't worth the effort of enforcement :> It's still illegal.
12hai drf
Piracy's illegal but it's fun.
14You up for it though?
14Lol
Most fun is illegal these days anyways.
14you never replied
But if you get into mousemats and such, that might attract attention. Could even be considered counterfitting.
12Just looked out the peek hole thing, it was some man I didn't know :/
I did.. <.<
Yeah but you'd think Nintendo would want their fans to intereact and have fun with other fans, draw etc.
Right guys I'm going to bed, tired as hell :( cya tomorrow ^^
12Couldnt have been important or he'd knocked again
interact*
HAKIWE!JL!JL!JL!!
and I suppose I am. though I'm tired so my accuracy will be even worse
Night everyone ^v^ *hugs everyone*
i took skittles on a walk ^_^
14Quilava cant be worse than me
14Oh!!!!
Nintendo just hate their fans having fun I guess.
12*huggles back*
14Skittles <3
you sure?
14Quilava yeh
14LOL
he was so sweet
/me Ah the land of dreams nah screw that SLEEP! :D
14Lol
12right, I'd have to charge at least £10 for a mousemat, that's nearly $20
i got him this little carrier so it's easy to take him on walks
12wow
12That doesnt include delivery
on the way home he would squawk every now and then and this lady walking in front of me kept looking around
she gave me the nastiest look O_o
14Ohh, you should film
14and why? O__o
14LOL
i'm not sure she ever realised i had a bird
i have no idea
she was weird
12Delivery pushes it up £2 if you're in the UK :/
12More in the US
14I can imagine
12Say £4..
12at least
12I doubt anyone would buy at those prices :(
i wish i didn't need to rehome him ;_; i've kind of decided against an owner though
and i'm looking at zoos and aviaries
i want him in that environment
i think he would be happier
/me would buy one (if it knew how) :\
only 14 squid for a mousemat?
a lot happier than getting used to strangers >_>
12£12 for UK
/me shivers
they're more expensive than that in a shop IIRC
12at least
12Are they?
14Oh really?
I'm not certain
14he wouldn't be happy with a new owner?
but I think so
/me looks around
12I can get em for £2 on Ebay lol, but not custom obviously
I use no mousemat :>
well he would eventually
^
but they're just not.. stable enough
14replacing a bird is always tricky
14they require stability
14Fickle things
he's such a loud bird, i think it would be better if he could be with his own kind in an environment where he's allowed to be loud
humans can't stand the noise, but it's what they're MADE to do
so i mean you can't really blame them too much >.> <.<
Articuno, you can do it witout having much expenses, since you only make something when someone has ordered something, it doesn't need to be your main source of income, but just something extra...
i've contacted several zoos which said it wasn't possible, but that was just through email
14Oh?
maybe we'll call some too and maybe at least they'll have a good idea of what i could do with him
14Why wouldnt it be possible?
14And ah
12Well I can also do mugs, posters, a photo collection of my art, greeting cards, calendars, stickers, notebooks, jigsaws, keyrings, coasters, canvas, magnets and shirts
14Yeah do that,
i dunno, against their policy or something
i mean it makes some sense, but ;_;
Ooh, posters. :o
Yeah, you have have nothing to lose really, you set up a page on the site, some one orders something, and you send it to them. XD
I WANT HIM IN A ZOO
RAWR
12I don't have anything to lose, no ^^
12But I will be sad if no one buys LOLOL

http://bnp.org.uk/2009/07/what-do-the-labour-fascists-want-to-hide/ <--- i am lol'd
2hey
LOL BNP.
/me huggles
/me isn't that late >_>
12labour fascists??
12Wtf
12?
12o.o
/me 2is in a fishy mood
i found the picture the most amusing part
2I'm going to kill Lilia in that RP
12Yeh, heheh
2D=<
12the BNP are a right bunch of nutters
I'm with her on Skype
12Labour are like the complete OPPOSIte of fascists
The picture is lulz
Aww... poor bird
12Anyway..
2dA keeps logging me out at random moments
2>.>
ew someone's smoking outside the window
12D:
I like how there's a chinese-looking guy in the BNP banner
2hi
British Nazi Party :>
12LOL
/me 2grabs Kyu's glasses so she can see the RP board
woman in the middle with a black jacket and reddish-pink shirt underneath, guy behind her
12How does he look Chinese? XD
LOL Vyl!
12lolz
12Oh the banenr, not the poster
12Sorry XD
There should be one called the Birthday Party
2O-O I can't find my glasses
12The one with the red hat Horo?
LOL wat
12LOL RN
Birthday Noise Party
the one in a military uniform, behind a posh woman in a shiny black jacket with red shirt
12Blah I can barely make it out
12Ahh
he's got really thin and wide tilted eyes
12Lol, just a bad photo
12but I can't see it very well, just had to turn down brightness on my screens for the first time in years
Hey Arti, are you familar with Toronto?
Where is it, as I've clicked on the link and can't see that photo
Hi
or something
maybe in the next one they'll go one better and you'll be able to see a black guy in the background
that would be lulzworthy
12D:
What would be even funnier is if Obama came to the UK and wanted to meet the BNP or something, they hate him
/me creates a shop on TST
Meh, everyone loves to hate the president
12CP yes I am
12I flew over it
or if the BNP actually won and we had to try continue the UK-US friendship
that would be awkward
Flew over it huh, how was the view?
12Can't remember
If the BNP won, this country would be like the government on V for Vendetta probably...
12Not even the slightest bit
XD
12the BNP will NOT win..
I'll consider observing then Arrow. :)
12I want Xai's party to win
12:>
There's no way they can anyway
BNP government would run the country to the ground.
We only have a few people, we need as many as possible
Didn
That's why they won't win. :V
I want the Ice Cream and Jelly Party to win
I plan on moving there next year by the way
Nick

12o.o
2=3
Ah.

12Nick I was just putting your idea into practice, the merchandise idea on TST
you always get a few weirdos in proportional elections, or so i hrd
hi light latios
12You get home with no troubles?
hey Nick
yeah I did ty
and glad you took my idea into account :>
nick!

in proportional representation the representatives end up retardedly divided
hi
12I'm soo lonely now ^^
hi Altair
awr :(
12So's RN
My train was packed but luckily the person next to me got off at Selby so I had seats to myself
12:(
xai still up?
Yeah
as even the smallest groups will get one seat
oh hi RN xD
12Nah Xai went to bed at 7
didnt notice you on
I've gtg
bai pplz~
They should rename Selby 'Celebi'
12bai Aero

07AERO
07WAIT
hey Nick! (late)
LOL I should use it again because I'm happy again now, and no that's not emo-related
07bah lol
Once when going somewhere with my friends, I forgot all my money, except for the money for the train, and realised after the train doors closed.
I like the way I've been wearing boots all day and they end up smelling like cinnamon.
hiya Ecco :>
12lolz
It's just a weird RN thing.
Aww
http://www.misfile.com/index.php?page=1018
so what sort of merchandises will you do arti?
@Articuno You can pop in our game if you feel up for it.
12I really need more light in this room
Yeah, it was quite funny how it turned out.
Mmkay
12Here's the list
12Mousemats, mugs, posters, a photo collection of my art, greeting cards, calendars, stickers, notebooks, jigsaws, keyrings, coasters, canvas, magnets and shirts
Arti, the only light I have are my two screens which are mainly black and a CRT somewhere behind me running Gran Turismo 4
I borrowed money from someone to get in, borrowed money for the bus, someone bought this drink thing, which you can fill up as many times as you want during the day (so I got free drinks), and I got free food from pizza hut.
wow thats a lot!
I'd like a poster
sorry to hear RN :(
I've got a sore ankle as well
Ok, cya. :(
Argh this is really starting to annoy me
I had a stomach ache in Waterstones but it went after a while
See ya all ^^
cya RN :c
Why won't people read my literature!!
I'll be online more often from now on
Bye
12Dont they read it on fanfiction?
12Horo I dunno why my eyes hurt so much, I usually never feel like this, I have the main light on as well
I didn't remove the current ones on DA
12I might bring in a lamp
I'm just annoyed with the fact that my friends pretty much promise they will read my work
Yet they don't
/me sighs
thinking on that CRT the music's starting to get annoying and I'm not actually playing ...
bai RN :(
12Aww
12I didnt see her saying she was going V____V
12How long are you on for Nick? I'll probably be here for another 2-3 hours
Brb, food.

Articuno, my warning stands. Don't be too surprised if Nintendo send a threatening letter accusing you of producing counterfeit goods.
6o_o
12I've sold fan art many times
12:>
12o.o
6I never thought of that
6but it counts-
6lol yeah
6it counts as fan art
12This is private and the art belongs to me
bah
I would get a mug XD
The characters are copyrighted to Nintendo, even if the art is yours.
Nintendo never does anything anyway.
12Well if they find me, they find me. But somehow I doubt they will
6wow...DA would be devastated if that followed through
brb
12Exactly..
12As well as Cafepress.com and many others

/me slaps Articuno around a bit with a large unstable Nuclear warhead
6I like the coloring style, but yeah
12Some of us spend hours trying to get Lugia to actuyally look right and those who just draw it all weird seem to get the most favs
2Horses used to be the only thing I could draw
6there's too much wrong
2Well... draw even a BIT realistically
I think I would run in that position
'wait you can catch it!'
You seen the size of it! Im outta here!
6granted I wish I could do backgrounds :O

After short deliberation, it is decided that it would be best for the channel if I take my leave from here for an indeterminate amount of time. This decision was reached after intensive analysis of the growth and stability of the channel and its inhabitants. This nick and all associated nicks will have their passwords scrambled to prevent future access henceforth. Other lines of communication - MS
N, email, etc. - will remain open until my own discretion. Again, my leave is for an indeterminate amount of time - this is not to say that I am leaving permanently, or that I will be gone a short time. Give my regards to any others who ask for it. Good luck. I'm out.

07[04:03:28] Arrow: All's fine, the plan I outlined works.
07[04:03:47] Arrow: Bags are packed, ready for flight.
07[04:04:35] Maria: Mrr. I'll miss you a lot, burd.
07I'll let you go, though I'm not sure that's what you genuinely want!
07[04:05:04] Arrow: You're right, it's not what I genuinely want.
07[04:05:25] Arrow: But it's what you need. It's what you want, from what I've inferred.
07[04:05:47] Maria: And again, you're wrong. I don't want you to leave!
07[04:05:53] Arrow: Time tah go
07[04:05:57] Arrow: "The exhileration of flying is too keen, the pleasure too great, for it to be neglected as a sport."

rbr going to restart mIRC
2heya brother Xeli and BF
02what in the world
2what Umbreon?
02wow awfully quiet
/me slaps Umbreon around a bit with a large trout
2!fail
/me gives Cube a steaming plate of FAIL
02...good morning altair?
/me explodes into laughter
2Guest
2ly
02hey coffee :)
2Hai Guest
:D
2Heya BPze!
2!fail
03LOL
2Altair's most randomnest script evar
03Hmm
03!fail
03XD
2>.> Umbreon didn't notice me lawl
2it was quite hilarious the way he thought Altair was awake lawl
2I activated his script at least 2 times while BPze activated his script 1 time Umbreon
2O_o
10lol
2heya brother Xeli *hugs*
10^^
03XD
/me pokes Umbreon with a Paul's Iced Coffee
02nah
02no thx
03XD
02meh
02what giratina is better?
02normal form or origin form as far as the video game goes
2Origin form of course
2that goes without saying
03Indeed.
03Normal form looks overweight.
02indeed what?
02i'm not talking about looks though
02i'm talking about stats
/me takes normal Giratina to Jenny Craig Weightloss Centre.
02the normal giratina is built to be defensive
02while the origin form is just a scary attacker
03I dont know, I dont own Platinum.
2BPze: try watching a few videos on youtube
2and Umbreon: I think Origin forme is better
03Hmm...
/me throws an Espeon at Umbreon instead.
2LOL
/me watches what would happen
02the one downside to origin form in my opinion
02is that your opponent is going to know what item it's holding, there is no surprise
03Good point.
02lol
02using knock off on giratina
02when it's origin form
02gets sent back to normal form
2I still think Origin form is alot better
03I still think Paul's Iced Coffees are teh bomb.
03;)
2LAWL
/me rofls
2your really random BPze
/me yawns
03*way
10lol
/me pretends nothing happens
2O.o?

/me collapses to the weight
2Ovo
03...but I dont have weight. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
10lolwut
/me is a ghost

2lawl
10Well, then i blame time paradoxes
10portal,lol
03XD
2:P
/me flees
/me is, to put it simply, a ghost. The correct term would be more like "shadow spirit with all the "fly-through-walls" transparency of a ghost. :P
10k!
/me disappears into the shadows and comes back with a Paul's Iced Coffee.
/me steals the Paul
2Ice Cofee
2fail*
03xD
2Ovo

Wow, that's weird.
2lol wb Bpze?
I saw me quit just as I joined.
03Articuno, is there some kind of time distortion field around where your computer is somewhere?
03:P
12Why? lol
2lol!
2mirc fail sometimes
03xD
03I use the Web-based IRC. <_<
2oh >.>
2that explains itt
2it*

2LAWL

03But teh web-based IRC is good! And it looks a LOT better than mIRC too.
2this is random :o
03:p
2Ovo Apparently Nasa said that on 2012 there's gonna be some sort of solar stoom
2storm*
12Yep
12Probably
2probably its another hoax
12Like the one in Canada I think back in the 80's
10Please don't say someone think that's enough to "End the world"
10then it's silly
12LOOL
2lol!
10because the worst it can do would be to kill a lot of satelites and stuff, lol
2now take that :P
10D: / :D
12It's going to be massive, it'll blast out a lot of power stations.
10And probably kill a lot of communication tech
2Articuno: then we'll have to say goodbye to our xbox 360s, ps3s, and mobile phones
10x... D:
2and pcs
10I wonder if the insurance says anything about solar storms...
2dunno lol
2now thats fun :D
/me flees
/me has always wondered how the beginning of mankind was like
02Articuno i think i know what your answer would be
02but stats wise
02what giratina form do you think is better, normal form or origin form
02giratina normal is a defensive beast, and origin form is just a scary attacker
2I'd say Origin form ftw
/me goes off to destroy teh sun
2lol fail
12Umbreon the attacker of course.
10lol
02actually i think the defensive original is better when i think of it
02it has 150 base HP
02the defensive form has 120 base defense and special defense
14Hi all
02put WoW on giratina
2eh?

2hi gvk spam

02Lyon i've been trying to get a natu with bold and sync ability
04Oh I see
/me doesn't care about natures or anything, or even IV"S AND EV's
/me pokes Lyon with a stick 'Lyon, you has msn?'
02i do somewhat
02i'm even going out of my way to get a natu
02even though i need to complete the story for platinum
04Meh, I don't play Platinum, even though I got the secret key
2okay
04I'm bored
04I'd play AQ but no new events have been released
2AQ!!! AdventureQuest?
10That game that puts it's silly adverts everywhere?!
10Oh my </sarcasm>
2lol
10^^
/me punches Xeli
04AQ is an awesome game
10IMO it's slightly below decent. About 6.5/10 *brick'd*
04IMO?
04AQ I would give a 8/10
10In my opinion = IMO
04CAUSE MOST OF THE FREAKING CHALLENGES ARE WAY UNFAIR
04It's really annoying
10That's one of the things pulling it up for me really. But then again, i haven't played it much at all.
04A Drakel Swordmistress appears around levels 60-80
04But just when I'm about to master killing them...
04BAM! A Drakel Swordmistress(2) comes up when I'm about to get the Dragon Blade
02now to get to giratina
04I have 1300 health, and they hit 40-80 damage twice in a turn
04And since it's a (2), there is 2 of them, which means they move twice a turn!
04Not to mention I was on half Health
04And out of Mana
04Wanna try that again?
10He can sit on me for all i care, derp

12I'm taking commissions ^^
2cya guys~
2Articunn: what commission?
12Badges
2mind explaining?
2oh.
12Or avatars if one really wants
10Cool ^^
2sounds cool to me
I already have a badge :>
10Hey Trias
/me gives Articuno a I win badge
2probably a new user
12They haven't said a word.
2maybe their busy or afk
2he/she*
12I always get slightly worried about people with new names who join for the first time and say nothing, almost feels like spying :>
2lol
12Since that has actually happened
2....
2since when?
12Loads of times
02i know the feeling arti
2oh.
12It doesn't happen often though
2why would they spy though?
02scary thing too is the name sounds awfully familiar to me
2it doesn't gives them any advantage
12Well it's usually someone we already know under a new name, spying on the chat for information about what's happening in the community etc.
2okay.
12Could be a banned member or a member that had a falling out with someone
12That's the usual thing
02dunno
12It doesn't ring any bells here
2its a beer product I think
12Mind you, nor does the place they're connecting from.
2Arti maybe their using a proxy
02yeah same thoughts on that
2Umbreon: huh?

14Did you see......did you see.......

7...lol
5I want a gaming system that can play records. So I can jam out to my (father's) REO Speedwagon and Rush albums.
Did you know that the 360 and the PS3 are selling at a loss in profit? And that the PS3 is selling for a THIRD of what it takes to make one? Sooner or later, the console wars are going to crash something. Either they're going to become too expensive to afford for consumers, or the companies are going to get raped because they made the consoles affordable but HAD to put in the latest and greatest
"U" forgot something, Abbey.
12Hell yeah.
14What?
6I can show them to you but NOT making out
14Aw.
12Damn.
14I mean........O:
crap and make it so nobody but the rich can afford it if they raixsed prices to at least buffer the loss.
PS3 is killing Sony. XD
6NOT with her anyway
14>.<
Definitely
14Brake them up then?
6I guess I /could/ get her with another girl..O_O
6lol
5The PS3 is going to fail completely. x3;
6I did..
/me uses the invisible boat alarm.
360 is making Microsoft proffit...
6the wii >>>> everything
5As in, profits and such.
PS3 takes ~800-900 to make PER UNIT
14Yeah, so get her together with someone else.
7Oh yeah
7I GOT TFU
i like the PS3
7Or, my bro did
$?
Kewl.
6They..they well slept together and broke up the next day
In USD, yes
7Can you get double lightsabers or double sided?
5Aurora: UH-UH. PS2 = Pwn. ;3
14WTF
I love that game.
....
14Slept together?
Because they were clever this time (like Nintendo), and got the patents for all the components for the 360, so they can get them manufactured cheaply, and they can lower the price loads.
6yus
14SIMS IS NOT RATED RIGHT!
14D:
Wii is horrible
CASUAL GAMAN
KJ: If by double sided you mean double end then both.
14PEGI lies. LIES!
Nintendo have ALWAYS had the patents to the components XD.
6I did all the romantic shit too..S:
The 360 is SO cheap
6AAARGH
14WTF!
6THE GUY DIED IN THE GYM
6rp4l, I mean the new generation
You can get one for like $150 now
7How do you get dual-wielding and the Maul-saber then? That's what we're calling them from now on.
6as in wii, 360, and ps3
I actually prefer my PS2. XD
07Wii costs too much
I can get a 360 for £40
i mean, there's a new Zelda/Mario, but really
Dari: sam
5Aurora: Yeah, there, I agree wit you.

I'm not sure, nbot to mentjion I only beat the crapppy Wii version.
5Hi Arti!
6Ok..Icy

Heya Wingsister.

12Hi Drag and everyone else ^^

6You wanna see my sim making out with another girl?
12Where you been?
6GBM?

Maul yes, not sure about dual.
12Life!?!?

I remember it.
7how do you get maul then?
Yeah, TP, and most Mario games are the best wii games.
other people on the internet do not have lives
14 1. Yes ..... i mean..... >.> and 2. GBM = Getaway: Black Monday
I'll check though.
The Game of Life, Arti.
/me 5hides from the wrath of Arti!
6O_O
6ICY
12:D
07Hello R2D2...I mean Arti
LOL!
big burd.
12Ovo
RP4L has been taken up with the Game of Life.
5LOOOOL.
12Yes?
KJ: Hang on, I'm debating on world issuees.
6You wanna see my sim making out with another girl?

14oh.
12Yes.
hi
6-.-
6has anyone here seen "My Sister's Keeper"?
14Of course that was directed at Icy.
6K
I ended up stuffing 20 children onto the back of a pickup truck
14<.< >.> <.<
/me 5resists the urge to blurt that R2D2 was spotted in the latest Star Trek movie... Oops! Too late!

14YT has a geek day.....Labelers >.>
6I found one -.-
6I'll try with her
6I need to talk to someone who has seen it and read it
6apparently, there's a huge difference between the two, MUCH larger than something like harry potter
5This gal at my church read it. She said she bawled at the end, so I'll probably read it first~
07RP4L, I've heard you will need to take a box of tissues with you
5I probably will. xD
5I cry at so many movies.
KJ: You can use Maul in Multi, but he has one if I remember.
I think that's the limit.
6I'm insane
6RP4L, I finished it on the plane....the peson next to me handed me tissues because he thought I was sick or something
5I cried during three Star Trek movies. And one Star Wars movie (when Vader died xD).
6I never cry at books o__o
7so you only get a maulsaber in multiplayer, and only if you play as maul?
5I cry at the end of SOME books. xD;
07Its like 10 times mushier than The Notebook
brb
5Mushier than the Notebook? Wow.
6rp4l yeah
What do you have it for?
6I haven't even read the notebook, but it's sad
7 360
6I'm taking a full box of tissues just in case
5I bawled the last twenty minutes of "Marley and Me" because my dog's getting old.... DD:
harry potter out in a day
6 2 days here
/me 6dresses her sim in Irish green
wens is out 4 you auroa
I'm about to borrow that from my friend, lol. Anyway, I played the Nintendo version which only allowed one, prolly because you're using the Wiimote. In 360 I bet you would be able to use Maul with double ended.
5My dad was sitting next to the tissue box when we all watched "Marley and Me" and kept handing my mom and I tissues. xD;;;
6wednesday
07I watched the HP marathon yesterday, so Im ready to see the new one!
12YAY someone enquired about keyrings from my shop ^^
There are two tourists in England, and it's a miserable day. They see a young boy who looks down. They say to him "I bet it's nice in England when it's sunny.", he replies: "I don't know, I'm only 10 years old."

Arti
13Chav shooting = most popular sport of the century
LOL, BF.
we dun allow it
iv got monny so we can get beers and ty and get pple out and go down the bech
03Arti, wanna see something I drew? :D

12Well you allow guns I mean :>
LOL*
We'll just dump em on Canada, arti.
12Yeh why shoot foxes?
12Chavs would be WAY more fun
05.........
Arti I'm still trying to get a few pics of the foxes that sleep on my shed lol
12I cant understand why people shoot foxes and NOT chavs LOOOL
LOL
12Hurry up then ! ^^'
XD
you can sell a dead fox.
:/
One thing that I think is really stupid is that kids are allowed to get away with pretty much anything. :/
05And by "Kids" you mean..?
03http://i31.tinypic.com/25iw6y8.jpg <---- :D
6God
wb RP4L </late>
6She really is a bitch
12Anyone under 16 I believe
Around 16 or younger.
12and yes
05Uh, I'm 16. xD
03XD
12They don't go to jail, they don't get any punishment
X
So they go and do it again. :/
I think the old laws should be bought back
14lol
12I think Xai should be the next prime minister
03XD
XD
05I get a week of grounding if I don't do one piece of homework, dude.
LOL
05Xai? Prime Minister? Uh...
05"Whatever makes you happy."
The old laws as in "You kill someone" you get hanged for it (Life for life instead of this crappy 30 year imprisonment AND less for good behaviour)
03If I get a grade lower than a B, I cant get onto the computer until my grades are back up =/
Nope
ok
05Same, Twilight. xD
If you plead guilty for murder you can probably get the sentence down to 15 years...
07I think we should bring caning to the US. Fewer people would break laws if they knew they'd get a beating!
iv got a Â£5
It's sto stupid.
Spent all of it yesterday
05(Unless it's English, 'cause I'm in AP next year.)
12You don't need to smack people to punish them
12They should be encouraged to do good things with positive reinforcement
Arti would you agree that if someone killed someone that they themselves should be hung or the electric chair?
12No
05They still have the Electric Chair in my state. I think we're the only one. xD;
12I used to
07Yeah...maybe that would work in your country, Arti
12But not anymore, I think an eye for an eye is too much
Articuno: You would agree if the person who was killed was related to you, I bet.
Depends on how that person killed them though (like self defense) but in cold blood then yeah
12Why do you say that?
6Oh no
Ok Arti, what about those Scum that kidnap, rape and then kill the person?
12However, someone who has mass murdered or hurt many many people, thats another story
Because if it's just some person that you don't know at all, you will almost definitely feel differently about it, than if the person was very close to you.
6I almost had a fire
12I feel for everyone.
12That's why I run this community
05Articuno: Well, I don't know about "eye for an eye"... In middle school, a friend of mine was assaulted and then killed. She was twelve. TWELVE. And what did the guy get? Jail for life. I think he should've been put on death row.
14O_O
05Oh, and the guy? He'd already raped his two stepdaughters previously. And GOTTEN OUT OF JAIL.
6And Stacey wants to WooHoo with the other one...
14how?
12and what does that achieve?
6Fire?
12Thats the problem
12Why did they let him out of jail?
05It's justice, if you ask me.
14did the cooker break down?
So you would have the same reaction to someone you didn't know being murdered, as you would to your mother being murdered, for example
?
05And I don't know.
6No
14DID THE ROCKET EXPLODE?
6XD
14stupid S2P >.>
12No, justice is to make them pay for what they've done, and think about it for the rest of their lives, rather than than easy way out
6She was cooking and fell asleep
14my rocket blew up in the house
14and my piano went on fire
05I suppose.
05I'm glad he's not getting out, though.
Also, we don't have space for all the people in jail.
6YUS
6O_O
Prison is expensive.
07Pssssh. Death row means nothing here. All they do is live at tax payers expense until they actually die of old age.
14lol
6YUS
6IT'S WORKING
14o-o
12Prison is expensive because people are given TVs etc
14rape?
14jk
12and day trips
12and all sorts of other nice things
I think that if someone killed your sibling (if you have one), you would want that person dead.
6XD
that ur tying to plan to go out
6Ok
Exactly
12and if people had proper punishments, they wouldnt want to go into jail would they?
6Confession and kiss
12I didn't do it.
14O:
14Icy, yes you did.
14To your Mum then your little sister.
14:D
14Joke
6XD
12Hell no!
Tuesday, I'm out with my mum
ok we can meat up then
6She sucks
Wednesday I'm at my mates 19th Birthday party
6Can't kiss her
14lol
I know that.
and tonight I'm likely to be out
14i got two girls to kiss once in S2P
14ONCE
12If a family member of mine was murdered, I
05Arti, I agree, but for multiple offenses... That might be different.
what bout 2mro
14Nebur happened again
14D:
12I'd expect that muderer to be puinsihed forever
12Thats FAR worse than the easy way out
Prison is quite luxurious, considering.
Oh Arti I'm starting to understand what you mean now
12Yeh it is
07I think if you are found guilty of crimes so bad that you are sentenced to death, they should actually put you to death. Over here there are serial killers and such that have been on "death row" for more years than I am old!
12and thats the problem
12Thats why prisons are overcrowded, no one gets punished anymore
6Lol
yes
6for fucks sake
14oh yeah
12What if you had to live on bread and water all day, and be made to work in prison?
I don't know why prison is like that, maybe human rights people complain.
14my friend got her sim to marry in S2P
6Why is it inapropriate to sleep at another persons house?
14it was weird o.o
6Lol
05Arti: Then there would probably be less crime.
14LOL!
12Yes yes.. it's all about human rights nowadays
Although murderers aren't human, they don't deserve those right.
rights.*
Human rights? HA
6God
14o-o
6Even the stereo is gold..-.-
12The thing is guys
14HE WAS THERE?
14LOL!
can i come round bout 10 30or 1100 after my docters apoment
05Dari: They're STILL human, and they STILL have rights, but justice needs to be paid.
6Ya
6XD
6Great!
ok
Mind if you do another one for me?
I don't see them that way.
12Some people can change for the better, there are cases of murderers etc. coming out and changing their lives around
I've got no credit so I can't text ya
either way I should be up
05Arti: Yeah. But not all do.
12I think nearly everyone should get second chances, but thats where it gets hard
i should have cred by then i hope
6She shooed my sim out because it was late and now Stacey's out in her pyjamas!
6Sure
05Arti: The thing is that sometimes they get a second chance and abuse it. =/
ok
12Yeh, like certain members of this site
05Uh...
12Which is why I don't give third chances anymore :>
05I s'pose.
Okay. I don't really crae how long it takes or what content you use but i do want this song
12But others have come back and learned from their mistakes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfO0TjJrTEU
can i bring somone
I already know one of those "certain members of this site" :P
12Although comparing a chat to muder etc. is a bit extreme XD
12*murder
05Agreed. xD
07Here in florida we had a HUGE prison riot because they cut food funding to a jail. This simply meant no more hot breakfast. (Cereal and milk instead of Eggs and bacon) They threatened to kill the gaurds unless hot breakfasts were returned. They got it. This is justice?
12But it does happen
07Heh
12No
12Totally not
janos might want to come aswell if thats ok
07I think I shouldve been out by then
12So how can they kill the guards if they're in a cell all day?
07I think I floofed the TST community a lot >v> lol
05Good question Arti.
12See, ways of controlling things
14LOL
12:D
xD
07I like second chances.
But because of human rights (God) they are entitled to get and get exercise.
07Im WAY too lenient
07You're only in a cell all day if you are in solitary confinement
12PAH!
07?
07Me?
12They can exercise in their cells ffs!
07LOL

05Why?

I'd say the oldest member is probably Razz.
12Oh yeh Aurora, my Silverflame Ho-oh pic is about 4000px lol
Not sure though.
13+ or not the use of the F word isn't appropiate for the site's content (nor the chat for that matter)
Razz left ages ago Dari

14To what?
14You didn't do anything.
7Your ultimate doom.
14You ARE on crack.

pet chocolate?
07O.-.o
7Satan likes to make people wait a bit. Too bad this means they can be revived.
07ew lol
7I'm NOT on crack... I think.
6LOL
Vegans shouldn't be allowed to eat plants either, killing poor plants and eating them, they have feelings too. :(
I once ate pet chocolate..
6WTF
14You THINK?
lol dari
14Tsk, boy, check.
6XD
that's not that bad. Just as very few sugar
7Yes, I do. You see abbey, /thinking/ is a normal human function. You should learn sometime.
I tried 100% coco chocolate.
Strong, lol.
/me 6rofls
my dad has a great atitude to vegetarianism, he says "if we're not suposed to eat them then why are they made of meat"
14You're not funny.
"Save me from being confused PLease show me what i'm looking for oh oh oh!"
14Seriously.
Pet chocolate tastes really disgusting XD
7Set 'er up, knock 'er down.
and
LOL
/me kicks self
07most i've ever had is 85%
FOOD D:
brbrbrbrbrbrb
7Not meant to be funny. If you think that, you're quite dellusional.
100%? Where did you get those?
7delusional?
7Meh.
14Fial.
the strongest I could get was a 99%
Dunno, my dad got it when he was at work. O_o
6isn't that baking chocolate?
wow
14and anyway, say whatever.
07lol
nah - baking chocolate is around 85%
7I shall.
07I wonder if 1% even makes a difference
6o_O
dootdootdoo
14You just hate people who like being happy. :P
07XD
hi Horo
7No, I hate /you/.
100% has no added sugar. XD
14Nah.
6WTF
Incase this one freezes
it does
lol
14You have no reason for hating me.
what?
i opened another
seriously, they add sugar?
the 1% is cacao butter - to hold everything together
...No it doesn't, reference. http://www.chocolatetradingco.com/magazine.asp?id=134
7Au contraire. I have every reason.
/me away
14Like?
Ah.
6Abbey..I think you'll be born
Fair enough.
14:D
born again
No added sugar != no sugar
eveyone wishes that huh
hi
just means they didn't ADD any
at least not in making the final product
6But as Abbey Langerak
6D:
7Abbey: I have emotions, and we have abrasive personalities.
big bahookey.
14That's not a reason D:
they could have added as much as they wanted in any of the ingredients though
14Come on, one thing.
7No, it's two.
14Two things then.
plus there's what there already was
7I gave you two. Or one, if you don't like the first.
14That's not a reason D:
Well that site says the chocolate is completely sugar free.
14You weren't like this when you first came here :3
So not just no added sugar, it doesn't have any natural sugar.
hell, by technical definition you can market sugar as no added sugar, since you're not actually ADDING any
/me feeds Kyu Kawfi
lol
7Yes it is. Short of a large amount of willpower I cannot be bothered to provide, we will always rub against each other and make a spark of dislike.
hi Quilava
What, you just buy the ingredients with added sugar in?
07hai Quil
hai peoples~
and also, there's no way it has no sugar
/me hugsa Quil
7I was not. I was a noob back then. So were you. I've changed, you've not.
it'd be energy-less
14I don't hate you. If you hate me then fine. :D
/me squeaks and hugs back ^^
im not a people...
T_T
you get 100% of your energy from sugar
I don't know, that's what it says.
yes you are :|
14I can say I tried.
6Argh
7Glad we understand each other. If Kongregate works, I shall go kill things.
6He died
14WHO?!
13Hi guys
14G.W Bush?!
6Your husband
7short lifespan these sims seem to have#
7Haha
imma wuff.
14My husband is Bush?
6NO
/me 14kills the sim me
6The have 90 days
14There we go.
6He was 100
14O:
13Why does shadow have two of him logged in on here? O_o
13and holy shit BB's on
4Backup
still a person
14Yup she is
13Why do you need a "backup"
14AND IM HAPPY
14BEST DAY EVER!
:p
4Becuase my pages keep on freezing and restarting on it's own
4it's insane
to produce energy, you either react glucose with oxygen or just react glucose, though the former is more efficient and generally better
glucose is a sugar
13you might have a virus or vundo
therefore, anything that gives you energy has sugar
4shiznit
6WTF DID THAT GUY DIE?
14SF I laugh if you had Zango
technically it doesn't, but it contains large molecules that are broken down into sugars
4hope not
4um
14But did you check if you DO have viruses, addware etc
so they are in essence sugars
6LOL
6My sim's talking to the Grim Reaper
They contain sugars.
14I TOLD YOU!
4my grandma downloaded pictures for her project
and I don't know of anything except materials like salt which totally lack glucose
14Now tell him to GTFO!
well yes I spose so
14o-o
13anything besides pictures
14Check them for viruses.
4lets check
6LOOOL
14Scan your computer basically.
anything that comes from a plant or animal in any way will contain at least traces of glucose
14It's most likely to be in the C: drive but-
14D:
cigarettes.
the tabacco will contain traces of glucose
guaranteed
:/
yeah but you don't eat them
interesting
6XD
i have trojen?! WTF MAN
whats in it is going inside you.
which only helps me 'cause it also makes mentioning them TOTALLY IRRELEVANT

14DB!
6one what website?
4Crappy crap
2Wazzup
/me 14glomps and put cellotape back on
6Unless if a boy is born..
2Ew, McAfee
2...Tape?!
6Then Kieran is born..
/me 2glamps Abbery
2glomps*
13You need to get Kaspersky; I've been trying to figure out how to turn McAfee off instead of deleting it to get my copy of Kaspersky running.
2glamps xD
14EW
lawts.
heya
14Nevermind
14-.-
/me 14goes outside room
6*on
6I'm calling your mom
lol
The entire community/staff there is stupid
The staff being the main culprits
really? Are they being mean? o_o?
6oh ffs
6I'd love doing digital art if it weren't for the fact that doing lineart is exceptionally hard
6I need PS
Well put it this way, I was demodded from that site because I told the admin to act better towards the members instead of insulting them when they break the rules
don't you have it? :|
2*mum
o_O
4I has a challenge only try if you want to
6no
4otherwise you may get angry
6my dad wont bring it home to install it
13shadow: did you hear me
That and me and a few other members started a rebellion but that's not the point
13or read me
6LOL
4about the security
ah, I see
13you need to get Kaspersky if you want good security
but how do those people get hired in the first place?
14Kaspersky did bull for me
/me 14locks door
4where to get
13I bet you never tried it
The thing with spyroforum is that I always did my job, kept it clean yet the admin was always telling me that I was doing wrong
13Try a place like Office Depot or Staples
Aero I have no idea
o_o
For example
4possible staples
4i'll look there
13It's in a green/blue box with a little red.
4good to know
6Yayz
Back in 2006 (or 2007) before I even knew about this place, I banned a member for using several profanities AIMED at the staff of spyroforum
The admins reply was (After I posted about it in the staff boards) EXACT REPLY "Why did you ban him, I wanted to insult him first"
O_O
LOL, SR is funny.
SR is a retard >.>
SR loves lasers.
Hence why I left
Wow, that's kinda corrupt. o_O
6AND I'M PISSED OFF NOW
And that's what happens when you're rich.
(He is rich).
ANd I had the misfortune to work alonside him :/
14.________.
o_o;
AS a moderator of his forum (I've never met him in person and nor would I want to)
6Anyways...
6See you all tomorrow
I think he just made the forum, because he wanted to have 'power' over people. XD
2...Ooook
2Bye C7
Wouldn't surprise me
6that kind of attitude just asks for someone to join there and start insulting people just for the fun of it
6Bye
14bye
6by people, I mean admins/mods
/me 14hugs
/me 6hugs back
14:3
The mods at SF are just as bad
What's pretty funny is that we beat them though, badly.
How old was the admin? He sounds like an immature 11 year old
6what is this 888chan?
He is 15 I believe
6I've heard it before
really now?
When he made the forum he was 12-13, I think.
2'3'
6Bai
He was 12 when he made the forum yeah
o_o I see now.
Though part of me still thinks he is about 40 >.>
888chan is a site like 4chan.
6what's 4chan >_>;
4Aw i missed it
Aurora, you don't want to know
Basically, they are all trolls (none of them can troll well) that go around and 'raid' sites they don't like.
6...
o_o;
6morons
It's really funny how they type.
"This is faggotry, must raid."
I thought it was more like an idiot porn board
xD
There are porn boards on 4chan. Lol.
I don't think there are on 888chan though.
o_o
meh, they still suck
bbl
One of the boards on there is dedicated to 'real life raids'. O_o

2I think
Dari do you still visit SF's IRC?
13eh whatever
4XD
13he's a God :P
Yeah, don't talk much on it though.
2Arr, Chuck Norris was selected instead
2xD
I barely go there either XD
And when I do it's only like a short 10 minute visit
In fact, they even got into the news for spreading porn all over youtube. :/ If that isn't enough to get them shut down, what is (They specifically put the tags as things that young children would search...)
Razz was a good mod as well
Meh, Razz always annoyed me.
She never actually did any moderating.
All she talked about was her art.
She still did what she could to prevent things on SF
12OMG I MADE NEW ART
I never used the forums much anyway, mainly the IRC.
LINK IT
12Anyone wanna buy art?
:OOO
12I love my art

...Ok
14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
12Me and Xai are seeing it as "Logic = Using your opinion to get the answer" and you are seeing it as "Logic = Using THIS opinion to get the answer" (making it changeable)
/me 14peels Master off floor
o: I took a class about perspective drawing
14Speak to me!
/me 2gets the bloewr upper thing

13wheeee
4YEPPIE
4oops cap
6eh what?
2YOU CAN TRUST NOBODY OR YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN

6ok, it's high time to end this sprite project

13Hey BB

14BB!
/me 14glomps
14^^
/me runs more
oh NOES... The tablet software isn't installed in this version of windows I'm using. TAT And PS doesn't exist on this version either

since RS its had the same pose and everything
HGSS' changes it slightly
6well, I mean from RSE/FRLG/DPPt
6oh good
http://i25.tinypic.com/34i5kkz.jpg
12<__<
6O_O
12Yeh thats REALLY disappointing
6LOL SPREAD-EAGLE
12However
12The Gyarados sprite is wonderful, and the animation
6Similar. ovo
its not exactly the same of course
http://pkmn.net/?action=dex&page=pokemon&id=250
6What, is it because there's nowhere else they can put all of those spectral feathers?
12Unlike the Gyarados sprite and animation from Platinum..
6it looks painfully spread
12It's almost identical..
I can think ofa better pose
6arti, where is the gyrados animation?
6I only saw a picture
perhaps dancing in fire
12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3807.0
12The link in there
the layouts have changed slightly
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=89941.0 check it
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=89941.0 and this
..
uhh
http://pkmn.net/forums/index.php?topic=88554.0
yeah
12Yay apricorns
the animation
s.. look the same :S
6The rain looks nice in this game, and I like the addition of it over the lake of rage
6it fits
just two sprites
6..
6that killed it
Hai Altair~
hi Altair
6I'm still buying it, but that animation killed many of my hopes
Heya Aero~
hallos
i won't mind
if you can switch them off
gyarados
6arti, it's not crystal animations
12Ok.. looks the same as what..?
6it's 2-frame
from Emerald
12I know it's not
12http://pokemonelite2000.com/sprites/emesprani/emesprani130.gif
6oh well, there's enough packed into this for me to like it still
12That looks nothing like the Gyarados animation for HGSS..
no I meant its the the same style as Emerald's
also
6No, Arti, as in there's only two frames, with lots of modifications to 'em.
12Oh
I shall be importatning the Japanese versions
would you like a few pages releated to them
like something screaming about lugia and such
12and yes two frames isn't that good but they seem to be overall better than the Platinum animations
12Where Gyarados moves up and down in a split second.. as if a large pokemon could do that :/
12How could you give me any Lugia info if it's all in Japanese?
12XD
I CAN READ JAPANESE
12lies
prove it
lul
6they're not as effect-dependant as emerals was
12Your mum
:O:
6that is good thankfully
I quite like Emerald's :x
12Lol Magneton in Emerald
12*Magnemite
Magnemiiiiiite I need lots of those. TAT
6Well, animation is limited when you have all 493 pokemon, an entire region, yadayada, to code.
12http://pokemonelite2000.com/sprites/emesprani/emesprani081.gif
lol~
spinning. :D
I wouldn't mind
drunken magnemite
if you could switch the damn things off
;-;
6LOL
(is that posisble in Platium?)
12Not sure not tried
12But likely
if you could have a look for me I'd be most grateful
12Ok one sec!
thank you! ^^
6You can turn off attack animations, why not other types?
6WOW
6WOAH
I seem to remember trying it in DP with no luck
6ovO
o_O?
6Zuh, Rora?
6I just watched the video again, and the gyrados looks like it MOVES in the lake
o_o/
*?
6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnn1Hm8uTME watch closely from 1:34
6it's a split second, but it moved
12No you can't turn em off.. strange, in the old games, battle animations meant everything animated
blah :[
at least they arent distorting the sprites
6yeah
thanks anyway Arti
Articuno?
12I wouldnt turn them off myself even if they're stupidly done ^^
12Yeh?
How did you do your silver colouring on Arrow again?
I got to that part and die inside
6gray with a shade of blue
12Let me show you on the colour box thing
/me 6splodes
Ok!
LOL
I hate peregrines and their markings
also
THEY TAKE FOREVER XD
in that Lugia pic
is Gold riding a Lapras?
o_O
http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=zsmveh&s=3
you know
the surfing sprite on GSC was a lapras..
6they're gonna be using a universal pokemon for surf
6like in DP
6basically a blob :/
D:
12Here you go, copy this
12http://h.imagehost.org/0846/setsdtuh.gif
12And use the colours around that area
6Faceted. ovo
Ok!
you're right, it is
thanks
annoying
thought they were brining back the Lapprass
even if it was out of place!
12BAH
also
12Another thing I hated like hell was the DPPt fly animation <v<
lots of http://www.serebii.net/heartgoldsoulsilver/pics.shtml images here
12The best one they ever did was RSE
6oh no
the phone is back
THE PHONE

6they're giving palkia hydro pump?
but the PHNOE
6=/-\=
6Phione? ovO
6:P
no the phone
6this will open up a large array of jokes
PokeGear
12Well Palkia is a water type,
6arti, it's uber suggestive o__o
12The phone sucks, VS seeker for the win
6O_o
o.o why?
12Whats suggestive?
6Doy, you're not going there, Rora?
10FFS

Aurora
wow

Hai Xeli~
6FEESH.
Aero lmao
just don't worry about it XD
6aero, I want to spare you the curse of knowing o_o

10o_O
Xeli hai

6SW, who says?
6I know of at least two games with good 3-d. :>
o_O
Shadow, I have played a 3d game, they gameplay was good the 3d is a bit angular
I shouldn't have been curious about stuffs. ;A;
thats the only problem i have
6you looked at it? =/-\=
oh.. textures can be a bit pixalates aswell
only the thumbnail image
6lol....
6well, now you know

If it's inappropriate I dun want to. XD
6Exactly. But stuff like this'll poke at your mind.
6Ah, well. Yay for immunities to this type of stuff. :>
10o_O
10Sorry to say, but my level of curiosity is sky high right now.

7Good for you.

14Lol, you should xD.
7Let's try and keep it that way
5Why?
Does anyone know what most PC games are coded in? O_o
/me Super Sues Aurora with Captain Falcon as his Lawyer
7meh
paint
14He's all about RP.
7Idk
7Mm.
14Seriously he asks anyone to RP with him.
dunno dari
10LOL that actually made me smile
7I need to check his progress really.
/me 6gets falconpawnched to the next dimension
(Someone I know is helping develop one which being coded with Python O_o)
07lol
yes
10it varies
7He used to be godawful.
7I hope he still isn't.
7Merc and Lat got him in gear
14:/
it doesn't realy make a difference to the finnished result really
!lag
-really
10as long as you know "your way" of doing it really good :o

7Strongest sentiment you'll wrangle from me.

13Moo
lol
14:/
10So well, you just had to enter the randomness leaderboards didn't you?
what dose the plant say
7"paragraph and/or literately/NON-GODMODINGLY RP" That should be the /average/.
13Even I don't know why I just did that
10It's your primal urges to say moo
/me recognizes randomness
lets all play hid and seek
07back
/me 5meeps.
Hey BB, has any of the game actually been coded yet?
04Angel espeon must have been a cow in her past... :P
7I'd invite you to Mind's Gate, but I really don't know how good you RP.
13D:
04jk

7You should join DCF, standards there are slowly but surely rising.

LugiaLordOfThepeas
07no place on the internet is safe from them
14o.o
Hm, well I suppose if the person writing the code is really good with Python, the game would turn out quite well.
13LugiaLordOfTheCarrots? :3
10dear god my mind is bent x.x
Are there screenshots of this other game she's working on?
Patltair
I want to see the end result.

7Ok, biggest recorded post is 1125 words long.
6done
6quan, I'm uploading
7This took me three days, but only due to laziness. The 1515 one was up in about a half hour.
7wait.
7My abiltiy to sort numbers is terrible.
5Three days?
5o w o
7yeah.
/me 5doesn't usually stay on posts in RPs for too long.
7But it was WAY back in feb.
7Back when I was still a semi-newbie.
/me 5always ends up with just little paragraphs that way. Not too small but not WAY big ; n ;
were quan?
@quan: My mom kicked me off her PC >_>;
litarely?
that's child abuse if so
7Yeah well, the 1515 one was the peak of a <<1up'd>> post competition between me and a friend.
7I won, needless to say.
6so how did you not log off?

5It'll be copy/pasted and such. And it's not that good.
7Hold on.
7us the PM tab
6FFS
6quan left
I hate RPs, because I'm way to lazy to go and post regularly, and pretending to play the role of something I'm not...By the media of text...Over the internet...Makes me feel really stupid.
5Shica sighed, looking to the ground. She was confused. Saddened. She knew this had to mean something-- and something most likely bad at that. In her lifetime she'd only remembered horrible memories...And however different this was from others...And how it wasn't hers...It still gave her a bad feeling. She didn't speak a word, closing her eyes. For a moment,
5anyways. SHe opened her eyes halfway. "I...I don't know what to say, really...I have a bad feeling that the mark meant ...something...right?" she looked Blackie in the eye. "Tell me it doesnt!" she began quietly sobbing. "Is it going to cause something?" she had too much going through her mind right now. Too much.

The blade before him – dark purple in colour, seemed to emanate a dark aura, so strong the feeling of energy in the air was nearly tangible. As the man laid his right hand on the hilt of the blade, he felt an immense surge of power enter his body. He chuckled to himself darkly, before slipping away, into the shadows. Now that he possessed the sword, the time for revenge had finally come…

You were bored, I gave you something to read. :P

7those were not big words.

Well, it sounds good.
7Indeed.
hihi
7I fail to see how you cannot RP.
7Hell, you'd probably be good

12lolz
Hello everyone.
5Do you guys wanna see some of my recent art? I just wanna post it somewhere and some of it isn't even on dA...yet. xD;;
/me 2changes to blue
12this one.
7That was unnecessary
There are cases of swine flu at my school.
Although we have to come in anyway.
7Four in mine. We're a shit school.
12Really? I thought Swine Flu was gone and passed.
...
/me randomly huggles everyone
It's only just started, really.
12Oh.
4...
/me huggles back
7I thought that about the credit crunch yesterday. No-one answered me.
12And why are you guys in school? It's summer.
7Not my fault if I'm iggerant.
7We're in england.
14o-o
7Not everyone lives in the cheap england knock-off.
12That sucks.
Supposedly (although I think it's exaggerated) by the end of this month 100,000 of us a day will catch swine flu.
12Hello.
12It's Obama's fault.
...
12That guy is ... you know.
What are you blaming Obama for?
7You'll forever be the Cheap England Ripoff.
12He sucks.
7No matter who you have as president.
No, but what's his fault?
4Since no one answered I'm piling eyeburn on you all anyways. http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stufffff/AerasRef.png http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stufffff/RRAGH.png http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stufffff/RRRAAAAGGHHH.png http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stuff
7EVERY world leader sucks.
4http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb271/bananasweetZ/01/Stufffff/Say_AAAAAAAAAH.png
12He spent more money than what George Bush spent on the war ... within his first month of presidency.
Obama is better than Bush.
7Fixing George Bush's mistakes, no?
Hell, anyone is better than Bush.
7Bush was an idiot.
12Just to begin...
7Obama is trying his hardest bless him. *has always wanted to say that*
7Oh for fuck's sake.
7NO-ONE CARES ABOUT RELIGION. YOU WANNA CARE ABOUT RELIGION, INVENT A TIME MACHINE AND GO BACK 200 YEARS.
12Obama has not been making the right choices for what to do with the war.
Obama has chosen to end the war.
7Bush has NEVER made a good choice.
I like that choice.
7A mother fucking ROCK can outsmart bush.
12And leave the Iraqui civilians to be terrorized?
12*Iraqi
7It's their mother-fucking country. Leave the bastards alone.
...The Iraqi government (or whatever) said they could handle it.
7No, they've always rammed their cocks into countries too weak to resist, to puff themselves up.
7If you ever stop because of cock-burn, you'll realise you've alienated everyone else.
12I'm surprised our Allies have not entered the war to help. Yet there's that World War issue.
7AHA
7I SAW IT COMING.
2wow the chat is dead drop silence
Vyl, PM?
12Hence Obama being an idiot.
12We also joined in on WWI, because our friendly countries needed help. Their troops were being outnumbered.
7We were winning.
12Tanks were being blown by artillery.
14-.-
7I once read a book on WWI. Chapter Five was the world at war. Chapter 11 was "Here come the yanks."
7Chapter 12 was victory.
7Coincidence, or glory-stealing?
12We kicked their asses.
7You let us take the full force of the attacks, then at the end you march in with fresh troops and finish off a weakened enemy.
7You bastards must feel proud.
12All anybody wanted was to get that war over with. Even the Allied countries sought for help to end the war quicker.
2b
*wb
12lol
12I don't know who our president was during WWI.
7We were nearly finished. Another punch and they'd be down. But you came in and did it for us, and expect thanks.
7I think it was Rosavelt.
7Or that might have been WWII
12Roosevelt did a lot of good things for our country.
12I think it was WWII.
ffs...
7Irregardless. We were nearly finished. Another punch and they'd be down. But you came in and did it for us, and expect thanks.

12Thankyou!
12Is that all you will say? Repeating what you already said previously? We didn't try to steal your glory. If the war was going to continue any longer, there will be more deaths. We jumped in to help. It just turned out to end a lot more quickly than what was thought to be.
Sorry we forgot before

14GOWH
14gj
7Nope.
14Oops
7KH2: Critical Mode. Level one. Data battles. No damage taken. No accessories. No abilities. Multiple bosses at once.
6I didnt think it was possible to pack so much into a game that I have no idea what's going on
7Well, check Jiminy's journal for information.
14ugh kingdom hearts
6:/
14arrow wants me to complete the second one LOL
7Lulz.
14had it for years but it's just sort of a turn off for me.
14I'm a fan of the first though.
/me 7prefers the storyline over everything else, truthfully.
6yeah obviously
Storyline > all
7There's always CoM and 358/2, Rora.
14I dont like it at all.
7Hawkeh, I repeat, y've seen Biskit047's YT videos?
14No, but I'm not too interested either honestly o.o
14so not to worry
7Blah, bbl.

6:/
6the only reason I wanna play is to understand the story of the Organization basically
03k, back again x-x
6The first KH doesn't really help at all exept at one of the members. Only KH:CoM, the up-coming KH358/2 day, and KH2

07hey
I would suck at being section leader
I was such a bad example XD
07Roara makes things complicated too

02this was after i dropped, this kid starts spying on us and walks upto us "did you play in the tournament"
/me makes vegetable soup for Kipi
We're playing House in Kyu's den
^-^
02"yes" "which one" "the tcg" "well i played in the video game and i got something cool" "is it a shiny milotic?" "how did you know?" "well there was a poster and almost everyone got one"

07I'd have to win the next regionals to be able to go again next year
02use a hacked team

02Tch they'd notice that
07lol
02then tech against FEAR
07unfortunately
07you'd need an AR for that
02lol
/me has an AR
07and the AR doesn't fit into the game slot
07XD
02btw kyu i was in stark mountain
02XD
02and used detect 3 times in a row against me >_>
07lol
02Computers always get away with that
07most i've ever gotten is 2 in a row
02i forgot i need to beat up all the police while it's still night
02XD That sounds so evil
02not my fault the police only want to beat you up at night time
02XD
02I was using my AR to change my appearance... and I accedentally turned into a TREE.
/me implodes
07lol
02I thought this was awesome, so I started fiddling with it. I turned into a Torchic.
02kyu he got the first two to work as well
02i taunt him as his 3rd detect fails
hi Avis
02XD That is infuriating.
07lol

02Hi Avis

It's good!
02Drew the hair, clothes, and the ears/tail, though.
02She's not supposed to be Umbreon anthro, though... she was imprisoned by an evil mastermind, and, using DNA from her umbreon, one of his scientists turned her into the form she is now.
/me nods.
'-'
02She met someone while she was imprisoned, an adopted Princess...
02Who is supposed to be "invisible" to the human eye.
Apparently not to the anthro eye.
02kyu needs to come back
02Not to the anthro eye, no. But that's because Pokemon that aren't allied with humans can see them...
If you don't already, you should write.
You're good at it.
02And so base DNA isn't allied with humans, obviously, so... yeah.
02What?!
02I can't write.

02And I finished it easily
2Orly?
2its much easier in english :3
04Meh, Gameplay? Doesn't matter what language
2its sort of hard to play in japanese
04Storyline? Language based
04I just beat Spiritomb in PMD2
04Again
02o.o
02Heh
02Drake, I figured out the storyline on my own
02When I was playing the game
04Still better in english
02And it was hard to finish, figuring out what you have to do on missions is HARD
02Meh
04I see...exactly! English/Native Language = better
/me is bored yet again
Bwee.
02o.o
02Well Drake
02Unless you want to wait another 6 months
02It is worth it
02and I've been waiting for KH Days since when it was first announced
04I'll wait
lol
02XD
02well, sometimes it's worth it
02^^
/me played as Riku
04It had better not be like Platinum
04Platinum is too much like D/P
harry potter HBP out 2mro
04Great...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6Q_koTHB54&feature=channel_page
02XD
02Platinum = FAIL
02And besides, the 3rd game is nearly always the same
portal = exlent
02With adjustments to fit both the games in, as well as extra parts
i have a portal gun in pokemon
04The only reason I want Sky is because you play as Grovyle in the future, and Giratina Origin Forme
04BBL
yay

6east bay, north bay?
2east bay
The place with the BART?
6south, west, weast?!
2YES
2XD
Just say nearest station
6east bay lol
/me hides
2XD
6so, close to kyu and them
2Dunno
6san ramon
Hmmm... talking about California
2yup
6you live in san ramon?!
lol Ramon
2I live in the northern most area of Berkely
5Cali is overrated. Everyone should come vacation in Nebraska. xD
/me 5runs!
Hmmm...
/me 2chases!!
Anyone living near the Marin County Civic Center?
/me oo
2hm...
Or had been there?

/me 5just failed.
/me 2chases RP4L
2>=3
Hmmm.
2:O
6 8D
/me does too
5D:
5Lucky you guys.
6there's only four of us >_>
5Still!
2I wants to join
2D:
6true
5I've never met anyone through the internet.
6XD
2But I can't
2LULS
2Me neither
6lol
5My parents would kill me if I even mentioned going to a dA or TST meet or something. xD
6this would be the last chance I have of meeting them most likely
2X3 I would if I could. But I'd have to have some reason to go there anyway
2:O
6rp4l, my parents don't know o3o
2XD
5xDDD
5Do you drive?
2CUZ YOU'R 18
6they don't know I even have an internet life XD
2XD
6yes I do
5LOL.
5My parents know me too well. xP
2Most people don't know I have a life at all
2DX
oo
/me was reading something else
2Most people I know IRL, anyway
/me 2slaps a bunch of people in her class
2>:U
07I dont see what the big deal would be with parents knowing. Tell them you want to meet your friends, they will take you, see that your "friends" arent creepy adults, then tell you to have fun.
5Haha, I wish it would be that simple.
2O.o
2Wouldn't work
5They'd be all, "I want to meet their parents."
07Thats what I would do for Cynder
2>_>
6What would happen if I did a mastermind plot?
2let's see... tiny 13-year old meets 19 year old, parents freak out and call the police
2No, seriously
07Hmmm...I guess if she was meeting up with boys I'd stay in the area
/me 2runs and hides from Roara
2XD
5I'm 16, so in a couple years, maybe I can join a meet...
5But I dunno.
12Try it, see what happens.
6Kyu's the only guy there
6there'd be 3 girls XD
6k
07Here in Florida you get your liscense at 16 so you'd be able to drive yourself now.
6I've had my liscense
6I could have gotten it at 16, but I didn't finish drivers ed in time
5Here, I could get my license, but I don't have enough driving experience.
07I've had mine longer than you guys are old!!!LOL
6Nothing happened..-.-
5Mainly because I'm paranoid about driving, but I digress... xD;
6lol
6it's not that bad
2X3
12Well then.
5I haaaaaate iiitt. D:
5THOUSANDS.
2More that the sharks world-wide and year-'round
2But then, that's like... 5 ~ 10
/me 2runs
07That doesnt mean you shouldnt drive!
6Exept the fact that nobody likes it
07Hundreds of people die from choking to death on their food too, does that mean you'll stop eating?!
6rp4l, thats because teens are too stupid to realize that texting while driving is dangerous
07Hi Andrew
hi
07LOL Roara!
2XD
07When I started driving the only real distraction would have been the radio, so my dad pulled mine out! D:
6:|
6I love my radio
2XD
6it's my relief for drving alone
2Classical
2Classical is #1
/me 2runs

2You know, everyone in my household is pretty athletic
2and then, there's me
2XD

6don't talk to me about athletics =/-\=
2Why?
/me offers rawra volley-bacon
6all my friends are athletic somehow, especially the ones who run 2 miles to water polo practice, run bak, and then go for an afternoon jog later
2O.o
6and I was born into a very non-athletic family
/me offers alteh bacon
07Theres barely any humidity in arizona. If you're lucky enough to have a pool, you always have to add water because of so much evaporation!
2WTH
yay athletics :D
/me pokes
6I pay sports, but I don't have the genetics to give me endurance X_x
/me 2only likes swimming. And soccer

6U can easily read text talk
2>.> What's it say>>
6*you
6 maybe a little bit of a loner. You do have friends, you just don't mind being alone. Gives you time to think. You are a little blunt, and you usually tell it like it is. You are classy, and simplicity goes a long way with you. You can be a little off-beat, your interests may not go with "the norm". As for your friends, you love them deeply. You may not have
2....
2oh!!
6You're not bubbly?
6WTF
6many close friends, but you choose them carefully. You are incredibly loyal to your friends, and they know they can count on you. You'd do just about anything for them, and they know it. You probably don't show your feelings so much, but you do have feelings. Deep ones, too. You feel things deeply, and you can be passionate - you just don't show it. Your sens
6it took me a minute to figure it out, which is why I said, "not easily"
2._. I think that's now self-explanatory
6sense of humor is probably a little dark, but you do love to laugh. You can be totally crazy when you open up, but you rarely do. You, in a nutshell: Classy, introverted, loyal, a bit of a loner, unique, edgy, deep, artistic, crazy (rarely), intelligent. BLACK!
wtf msh bff rose.

6you have to use it over and over again
6At that waterpark with the evil slide,there was also a huge bucket you could stand under and then it would turn over and spill all the water on you
14LOL!
6struggle is the move that all pokemon can use when they run out of PP
The only rides I don't do are freefall drop ones. Like.... Megadrop xD

its not telling me my name is registered D:
Eon: Netsplit.
pfff netsplit
Hiya
dari: maybe cause its easier this way. sides, the word without the brackets doesn't kill so people aren't likely to use it anyway
eee its raining so much here atm :D
6lucky >-.;
Yeah, but that's slightly strange...And it's not easier, because that means writing an extra script, lol.
6>_>
2...
2Does he say he loves you when you say that then?
Hey there all - let me guess - net split?
Yep.
Yep
services are dead aren't they..
hey
I wondered why Arti wasn't the owner anymore with no ~, haha.

6>_>

;)
wut.
/me dies
European versions don't allow gamling in the game, grrrrrr
O_o
urdoinitrong
i spent all my money at mall b4 this
RN wtf
It's better to spend virtual money than real money....didn't they think of that?
Yeah they took the gambling out of veilstone in our version
07lolwut?
what??
07really?
Yup
07what's there then?
Well the machines are there but it will not let us play them
07oh XD
why??
fail
it just says 'it's a gaming machine' or something when you click to go on them
XD
brb
do you have coin case
in the europe version of platinum gambling is off?
Yeah
prob
since its a *childrens* game
And yes it lets us have coin cases, change money into coins and occasionally find coins in there.
ill import one from us then D:
...
O_o
Yeah I guess, but it's better to spend virtual money than real money I guess.
they didn't think that out very well, did they
14Im importing >>
14lol
Nope - as it's now very difficult to get the prizes.
02kyu
02want to hear something funny?
07you just only buy the coins?
14Im buying it abroad >> lol
Yeah I wish I'd got the US version now
07because that's what most people do
I just ended up buying them myself anyway, gambling took too long
07XD
02i was doing research
02and i found this
And yeah, Kyu
02In Japanese Diamond / Pearl, if a Pokemon with Choice Band / Choice Scarf / Choice Specs uses Pursuit on its first turn out, and the target switches out and is KOed, the Pokemon using Pursuit can select a new move. In English Diamond / Pearl and Platinum, the Pursuit user is locked into Pursuit.
It's fun to go on those machines xD
07lol
07I remember that
I've been donw the arcades all day (got back indoors at about 6:30pm lol)
02i gotta get a japanese diamond/pearl

07X3

Wait, let me turns remotes off. XD

!lag works
Yeah I fixed lag

14?

/me hugs Quil back lately
7The example of a script on the TST page.
14!lag
14Oo
7Since it always has to start with a !
Ohh
7Eg, !eat.
yeah
/help timer
they just dont work
And there is no !eat?
12lol
12Xai just predicted what I was going to say :(
I can't believe no one has made one from the example lol
haha
What, "lol"?
exp share is such a nice item :)
2nd best
hax? D:

7!lag
!lag
10derp
!lag
...
:(
07lol
Yeah?
I've seen mIRC scripts that edit ping replys
07lol
Yes...?
take it off and you'll get an accurate reading xD
But how does 0.001 = 2728.14?
07and considering I pinged him with no reply XD
Kyu
It rounds
So when it says 0secs on mine, it's more like .08
etc
7!lag o3o
not the actual lag
o-O
But it's the same as an actual lag response.
Oh bah.
But it's set
My client registers it as an actual lag
But there's still no difference. O_o
There must be, since no one else's says insane numbers XD
07lol
6so altair
/me squeaks
6if your script is screwed up, what would have happened if someone got "1"\?
What, does it set the time when the someone says !lag, then take the first time off the time you receive the ping?
/me 6flees
That's the easiest way.
I'll make it ping you with 1 second, 1 second after I say !lag, and see what happens. O_o
huh?
!lag
...
O_o?
...
-> [Altair] PING 1
lol
07XD
the output that is
I wonder why it does that...
Time, and finger scripts output correctly when editted. XD
:P
Oh this fails
I removed the hash adder thing from the script, and put it into a .txt file
now I deleted it D:!
O_o
10oo
7Wow, time is so wonky for me these days.
7And so is the perception of difficulty.
/me yawns
Well, lol.

Hey.

They work together to show off their Pokemon, and when it comes to the battling portion of the contest all 5 of the co-ordinators Pokemon work together to defeat the other 5 co-ordinators Pokemon. I am going to increase the max team number to 6, since Aurora joined. <-anyone make sense of this?
02dunno

6I love the movies
2who's going to then make me do homework
07lol
6mainly for the amazing cast
the books were great, but the film adaptations leave a little to be desired
07a lot to be desired
6I like how everyone seems to fit the roles perfectly
2I don't much care for them, I'd just rather watch a movie than do homework
2o3o
Woo, English cast. :)

10o_O
I think it's safe to say that Twilight has the most annoying fan base...Ever...
2XD
14Oh?
14why?
2why?
All annoying teenage girls.
2Sorry, I'm readin' it right now
2o3o
"*Squeel* EDWARD! I LOVE MY SPARKLY VAMPIRE"
2uh....
2they... don't do that
PEOPLE SAID STUFF
OR SO MIBBIT SAYS
>_>
hi
2YES THEY DID
2XD
...Yes...They do...
There's even a watch now that says "I love boys that sparkle" on it...
cant wate till holday
07lol
Also, the books are extremely annoying.
so is she
lol
Some words are repeated SO many times.
so what so hi
lol so
And once every 5 pages, you get a description about some feature of Edward.
2Then what about "a Series of Unfortunate Events?"
2They repeated "ever" for over a page
Dunno, never read the books.
2almost a page and a half. 2nd book
what about zelda commics
And? That's just the way the author writes, and he doesn't do that every 10 pages or so, does he? He does it once.
Someone counted all the references to Edward once...
It was ridiculous.
uh
10I think it's safe to say that Twilight has the most annoying fan base
can anyone explain that
10I just read that, and it's pretty close to the truth
Fine, the majority of the fan base.
I've read them too.
but Ive just read them
I wouldn't judge it otherwise. :P
10most of them shouldn'y even be allowed to complain when beeing trolled.
not sure id bother with anything else to do with it
10I mean... they're so easily butthurt. say twilight ain't your FAVE book and the s-storm rages
yeah
srsly?
twilight sucks
10xD
10Yeah it happened to me.
10On dA, lol.
the books were good, the film was okay, the majority of fans are anoying
aparently
2whatever
10I just said "I don't really like twilight, but this' a nice picture" and then they tried their 1/10 troll attempts on me, but whatever as said
omg
2I don't much care for Twilight, but I'm not about to put then down
o_O
im fighting someone with a SHINy chatot
in the restraunt
2XD
O_o

I have recently found out more of how people in this world are so ... stupid.
People suck at driving.

Whoa. Sorry. I was posting in SpyroForum.
You have a bad connection, don
t you?
me?
Is anybody here?
BOOM
You're back
I drift in and out
Hey
Me too. I'm on the Mibbit's main chat server. #chat
I don't use Mibbit anymore
You don't?
You're on it right now.
No I'm not
Uh...
I no longer use Mibbit services :)
Hey, are you posting on the forum right now?
I has converted
nope
What are you doing?
I haven't checked the forum alld ay
wow.
at the moment I'm currently arguing with a moron
on a different site
Oh, that must be fun.
I want to join.
much
proves their is always someone dumber
Hahaha.
/me yawns
You must be tired of that fool.
eh
don't really care
Not much people come on the SpyroChat much anymore ... so I just rely on Xbox Live. But my dad is hogging the television.
is the link still broken from the forum
Yes.
that would be why
I guess that's why.
that and the site is stil down
registrations
SpyroChat?
or SpyroForum?
SpyroForum
SC doesn't have registratiosn
I've been posting on it a lot lately.
It's not down/ Unless you're talking about it not letting in any more registrations.
I just said registrations
nobody new can join the site
Alright. Good.
no
that's bad
lol
It was getting way too much people every day anyways.
Well, that can be bad also.
Hmm ...
the site is no longer growing
geyfest
and the admin hasn't been encouraging growth
Yeah ...
Somebody needs to clean out the hundreds of people who have not posted one comment in months. It's just packing up with members who don't post.
well
I don't have the right to do that
but now I'm out
cya
See you later, brother.
Sleep well tonight.

6Hey
7Being ill sucks
7and hi
7Hey dari, what ever happened to the stuff you promised to do for DM?
14Aw, your ill. How are you feeling?
/me 7is not comfortable with the sudden jump from constant animosity to one-sided friendship.
6...
14I was just asking..
7meh
6Hey
12Hi.
14Oh great it's pervyboy.
14-.-
12I'm not a perv.
14Sure...
6Sick of my life.-.-
14O; Why C7?
6Because of getting in trouble every single fucking minute of the day
14O.o
14For what, exactly?
6Pretty much everything I do
14D:
6I even get in trouble because my dad /thinks/ that I'm doing something her doesn't like or something
14o-o
14I know, my parents always /think/ i do something wrong and don't listen when I explain
6Yeah.Tis very annoying..
14-.-
6The other time someone knocked on the door,I didn't know who it was so I did like I was told:I didn't open.My dad asks me who it is and I say Idk and then because he /thought/ it was my grandma or something he stormed off to open the door and muttered "Can't even do a thing right".
14D:
6I mentioned it to my mom too and then next she told me that he said that he never said anything like that
6*next day
14My mum always asks me to bring something and forgets to tell me a part of it so when i come to her she says where's the other stuff and calls me lazy >.>
6D:
14o.o
14D:
6The whole thing's just seriously unfair
14I know -.-
14She nicked the router today, for no reason, and I'm left with crappy connection >.>
6The other time I got in trouble because it annoys him that I watch MTV
6D:
14And my bro sits on his laptop like all day in his room and they say nothing, NOTHING
14freaking mentchals
6D:
14o.o From just watching MTV?
14D:
6Some months ago he was telling me that the fucking cousie is awesome and that he'd congratulate her for moving to Athens from Rhodes,making new friends so fast and getting "awesome" marks.
6Yeah.Not to coun't the fact that I wasn't even watching fucking MTV at that time..
14I hate it when parents say stuff like that
6brb
14they always compare you to other people
6Yeah
14o-o
14WTF
6Not to count the fact that she used me to make friends and just copies everything to get her great marks that aren't even that much better than mine
14....
14wow.....that sucks
6Yeah..
14D:
6But yeah..And you can see how much she pays attention by the thing that happened in June../She/ was studying the religion thing when we were writing German the next day
14My mum is so paranoid though, she worries about what people think EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREAKING PLANET
6O_O
6D:
14o-o
14o.o
6Anyway..
14:/
6Or the thing they tell you to look at the others to get examples and then they tell you that they don't give a shit about anyone else
14I KNOW
7I'm in trouble for being /ill/.
6O_O
7Which is fucking rediculous.
14Mum: Look at all your friends. They study. Me: YOU DONT FUCKING KNOW THEM!
6Yeah..
7So I had a hissy fit and jamned my door shut.
7I refused to open it until I got my apology.
6Yeah like everyone else is perfect or something
14Seriously parents nowadays D<
14I KNOW
7The quartet of bitching is complete!
6lol
Hey.
7We're having a complain fest, feel like joining?
Nah can't be arsed
if you've read my dA journal, you'll know why
14She even made me swear at her by accident.
6Or basically,whenever my parents are mad and I talk to them /I/ get in trouble
14O:
6:O
14I know!
lol
I can only lol at you guys
that is NOTHING
14Well, when my mum fought with my brother, he left and she started shouting at me
6Not to count the fact that they're almost always mad so then I can't be in a good mood either from all the negetive energy
6D:
HA!
14"You're just like your brother. Do this. Do that." WHY DONT YOU DROP DEAD?!
6We have a hole in the kitchen door
14D:
Lol at the hole
Why am I laughing???
14o-o
6Yeah ..Well that day I was scared shitless
14oo
6And my keyboard might be ruined because he was in a bad mood
14Why is there a hole?
7You've gotta know me well enough by now to know how much of a social failure I am. I'm in the same boat, I assure you.
Lol
6Because he was really fucking pissed off and banged something against it
Social freaks ftw
7Indeed.
7We need a badge.
I'm making a stamp on dA
7Awesome.
7My situation is almost identical.
14o-o
7I've only recently started making actual friends at school, and over the summer most of them are moving away.
Lol at that#
7My situation with eveyrone else is not helped by the fact that I have about 75% of the swine flu symptoms
7And I've been feeling hot for the last hour or so, the main missing component was the temperature.
eeeeek
Don't wory kieran, I've hugged someone with swine flu
7You hug me you die.
hey I haven;t got it
14o.o
I think
7That does not affect the 'die' rule.
Several people in my school have it
6I couldn't sleep so I came out at 3 am to say eht or something and when I went back in my mom was telling my dad that I need a fan in my room and the he got all pissed off because I didn't ask for it and my mom was just saying it or something and then he started yelling like hell and everything,the fan finally got in,he was still yelling,my grandma came down
grandma came down
anymore???
14....
14o-o
6to see what was going on and he got even more pissed off so he did the thing with door right when my mom open the door
6Yus
6It wouldn't fir
6*Fit
14o.o
6So yeah
Nope lol
Found it
6I just tried to keep a good way away from him for two days or more
Very short search on dA
7You know, I am 90% of the more agressive things on there.
7aggressive?
7Meh
Yeah I've just been a little down at the moment ith all the problems at home
Lol
14Aw. D:
6Ugh.And I get told to stand up for myself,but who the FUCk am I supposed to do that if I'm gonna get in even more trouble?
6D<
7I think I'd be depressed if I wasn't a pathological victor. If they made me depressed, I would lose.
If I try to stand up for myself I get hit in the face
6DDD:
6I only dare t-
6UGH
14o-o
6Now I have to get off any min because /he/ wants to go on
7My parents aren't that far yet. I think I can still hold power over them.
14You get hit?
14Lol, I remember the time I fought with my mum >.>
6Tell me I can get left home alone for a bit..D:
Remember the night I was hit 8 times in the head by my dad :)
That's when it started
6DDD:
7Indeed.
14O_O
14 8 times?
7Didn't he break the computer and blame you?
he was getting in a strop about the fact that I didn't want to eat my sausage in my dinner
14D:
14D:
6D:
Urgh... might have been a while ago I can't remember
I thin khe did
6It's like parent think they're something special or something
abbey, please stop D: ing please ^^;;;;
6*parents
14o.o
14wow :x If i get hit I automatically hit the person back without thinking
14I don't like being touched >.>
7I'm lucky I got my own computer. We originally had two, because me and my bro used to do a lot of work on the old one, and it simply just couldn't handle it.
7Then, when my bro moved to uni I got the better computer.
6Though I haven't been attacked for 3 years
7I don't so much as hit people back, as go mother-fucking berserk.
6YUS
14Your lucky Dx My brother has his laptop and doesn't get bugged and since the computer is downstairs i get bugged everyday
14Seriously -.-
7I've sent like three people to the hospital.
7That I know of.
6O_O
6lol
14o-o
14O_O#
14WTF
Lol
6I've never done that...
6And I don't wanna know what'll happen if I did..D:
My dad neearly broke my aankle a few nights back
7Possibly four or more. This bastard pissed me off on monday, and I don't know his condition because I've been off sick for the rest of the week.
14O_O
14Are you ok?
yeah
just bruised a bit
6That sucks..
14I hate it when parents think it's okay to hit you
14-.-
6I can't wait to move out really..>.<
14This is how some babies die.
14-.-
7My parents may actually be slightly scared.
6Be free to live without getting in trouble all the time
6Hey SF
7I jam my door handle with my hockey stick, and if I use that as a weapon I could probably kill someone.
hiya
14o-o
LOL
I really reallly need a rounders bat
14I wish i could lock my door >.>
6If my mom hits me it's only like a little slap on the arm
Out of all the "weapons" I could use, that is my best one
7Well, I could kill someone with my bare hands, but it doesn't have the nice aesthetic affect as a skull crumpling.
True
6lol
14o.o
7Nah, you need one of those special harder-than-metal hockey sticks. I once broke two of my bro's teeth with an accidental swing.
6Yeah..doesn't do much anyway
If my mom hits me it's a tennis racket in the face
14I swear
14My mum hits me like a tn of bricks
14ton*
6Only if I really annoy her
6D:
6Ugh
6I wish my dad could AT LEAST bother to take his plate in..D<
6brb
seriously? dang lazy parents
14Her hits hurt for like the next hour
14......-.-
14YOU THINK?!
14D<
14Even if I was dying on the floor they would ask me to do the most simple things.
6Back
14wb
6D:
6Thnx
6All my dad does is cook if my mom doesn't have time to..D<
Ever cook for them? D:
14Lol, my dad cooks like every 2 weeks.
6Otherwise he just orders us around or something and tells us off if we don't do something as perfectly as he wants it
D:
That's cruel
LOL
6Yeah
That's NOTHING
6And it pisses me off..
7I /can/ cook. We have a cooking class every term once a year. I generally absorb skills through my skin.
I won't go into smug mode since I shouldn't be smug about the fact that I get hit by my dad
14People do have worse parents :/
6Only thing I can make is a toast..-.-

it's not that sad you know
6I can't understand what exactly they're saying cause of the echo sit of my computer
fine i'l watch it
and heres a fact
6Is it something like this comet hitting earth and the guy sacrifices himself to save the world?
6Oh noes
yeah in a nut shell
6Wb
12My bad.
Comit thing is to hit the earth
6I've seen a movie with the exact same thing..it's one of my favs I think
NASA send up a team of drillers up onto the comit to plant a bomb in the centre of it to blow it up
6One with Elijah Wood
6Yeah
The leader of the drillers has a daughter called gracie, and she's in love with one of the guys in the team
so a guy splits a comet in half to save the world?
6Oh
and up on the comit, they have to draw straws to see who's going to stay behind to blow it up
I'm cutting back most of the plot here lol
6Woot.4 of the songs I like are in the Rock chart
the boy who gracie loves picks to short straw
now watch a quick laugh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6p4nruMjKA
the leader takes the boy outside on to the comit, to show him what to do
but he breaks his air supply and throws him back into the ship, so the leader blows up the comit
6Wait
6Hey
7I loves it

13Shadow
hm?
13go download a free little malwarebytes scanner, go into safe mode, and scan your computer
Lol he's been looking at an advert
38 infections i know
13if there's ACTUALLY anything on your computer, it'll be able to be removed
Lol he's been looking at an advert
13What?
You know those adverts on the that say that you have loads of viruses
he's lookedat that and downloaded from it
They lie
they lie and then give you more viruses
get windows defender
13Did you, Shadow?
13Everyone should know not to download that stuff
i dunno i haven't dun crap
13If you want to be fully secure you need to get Kaspersky
It saved this one many times
true
6..D:
but for those who have no money, get windows defender for some small stuff then get a malware remover
13malwarebytes can at least show you and remove the true stuff
13in safe mode, though
13otherwise it can't.
bbl i'm gonna go have breakfest

/ns help
Dari?
I've been there.
nick grouping I mean?
Cool. :)
Is it nice?
I am going to give you some very important advice.
*WATERPROOF* sunscreen!
I cannot stress that enough.
Lol. XD
I was stuck in the hotel for a week with severe blisters.
I'll ask if we have some.
The sun is extremally intense, and you'll be in and out of water at quite a few places I imagine.
So get waterproof sunscreen, slap it on thick and reapply often.
7Zack Efrothos?
hang on brb
wb
Ouch. :(
Vyl, that happened to me too - the problem is, waterproof sunscreen comes off when going down slides in water parks
12Nyah?
Oh, hey, Vyl? PM?

12Because I finished those now, but still have some other ones I need to take till next week

12LOOOL
Who's Charley...?
*Charlie
Charlie*
So...?
I was talking to my friend, who's obsessed with him, and I asked what she thought about him and she spoke to me at a pace at acout..... 20 words a second maybe?
Yeah but then he'd end up getting one too so you could have races
12I felt really bad the day before you guys came over as well, Xai's mum had taken me out so I had to walk a lot then too
You can't say you're not at least that bad.
*about
7If out of you, you're not the obsessed one... you're not bringing anyone here ever again.
Aww it's ok ^^ Friday nights are like that for me, I nearly pass out after 9pm, and that's with no drinks involved
Okay I will bring Courtney and Kerry on here
Someone want to enlighten me about Charlie...And Courtney...And Kerry?
The biggest doctor who and harry potter nerds I know :D
7You know what's fun? Accumulating knowledge about people to blackmail people so that when something embarrassing slips you have an arsenal.
LOL the dog is pounding the kitchen door - bear in mind he's only a Jack Russell, it sounds like there's a battering ram behind there
7Charlie is RD12.
2XD
Oh...Yeah.
2We have a Jack Russell too
2they're very strong small-sized dogs
Yeah and for some reason mine thinks my hands and feet are T Bone steaks
2XD
2Mine likes to steal socks
2and hats
Mine likes too aswell and steal shoes, then run round the garden with them
You haven't got anything to blackmail me with.

7NICK
harry potter 6 is exlent
Articuno, She said she'd be checking her email while here, to keep in contact with Arrow.
12We just paid, it said £0 tax, it also said £20 charge for using anything other than Visa Electron to pay.. so we used my Visa Electron..
So you can reach her by email.
/me 2is going to try converting Pounds to $s
12Im gonna try phone her

12Then she's landed XD
2WHOA!!
2XD Arti, that's amazing!!
I don't know. But I don't imagine a flight from norway takes too long.
She was at the airport there as of 5:30...
122 hours it is
12or so
2LOL
Well, that was four hours ago. So that's around two hours since she got here...
o.o;
So, I'd estimate she should be just finishing settling in and unpacking.
Yep, that makes this a good time to call her :>

I lol'd at Fallout 3 before
2LAWL
2why
I bought the game on Steam, but by the looks of it at the moment, I have to buy the DLC on WIndows LIVE Marketplace.
I somehow read that as I failed at failout 3 before....
2lol
i might buy it... if I enjoy Fallout 3 much
atm its good, I was worried about getting it cos I heard all this OBLIVION WITH GUNS talk, but it feels so much better than Oblivion
there are more than like, four voice actors for a start
and, since I just noticed it (sorry :( ), thanks Nick! 8D

See you in 2 weeks.
Hey.
I need advice
02hmm
A friend of mine is banned from a channel for reasons I'm unfamiliar with. He's really nice and he seems well behaved, but as said before, he's been banned.
I just happen to be an op in that certain channel on another server...
/me nods
Well I would have thought the best thing to do first would be to find out why he was banned.
02that seems like the most reasonable thing to do
02being a friend and unbanning him wouldn't really be the answer
12Whos banned now? XD
02another server
12Good
Well, HE said it's because one of the ops has a power hungry thing which is believeanle, because every chanel my friend is banned at, the other person is an op in
/me offers Arti a peadge feather.
02hmm
02was said person the one who banned him though?
You should also find out what the person who banned him has to say though.
I already did
Oh.
The op banned him in one channel for arguing, then banned him at every other channel he ops in
02that doesn't sound very reasonable
2Hai guys ^^
02what happens in one channel, happened in that channel only
02it shouldn't effect or concern say 5 or 6 other channeld
02s
'k, well I'm trying to get him in now
2dead chat
GOOD

02Well, a little less than 1000 is okay
04Still, I need to get better
02In your opinion perhaps, but I write around 1500
02And this chapter needed more, because it was the mission and that thingy as well
02XD
04And I AM paying attention to your advice, I was tired when I wrote the last part of that chapter
02And yeah, you're right..."LYON LOLOLOLOL

02And I'm deciding on the name of the 4 DMs/lieutenants

02Original names were Timbusters LOLOLOLOLOL

02Argh dang
02I don't know how to use Apache
Try going by IP?
02?
02What?
02Come again
If you don't have a valid internet DNS address, use IP instead.
02I still don't get what you mean, Vyl
02Ergh
02This is annoying, and I tried my IP
02It's the same as that
02Rawr
/me pokes Drake
02Does this work?
02http://192.168.0.100/
That's a local IP, too.
02Well
02What do I do?
You'll need to configure a forward on your router.
02Huh?
02You mean go to my router page?
02Hm....
12Your IP is 122.106.102.39
02Ergh, thi
02o.o
02Well mine says differently lol
02Thanks Arti
12But if I go there, nothing happens. You need to open Port 80 in the firewall
192.168.0.100 is your router password.
12I think it's 80.. ovo
IP*
Lol.
12lol password
:P
02Yeah, it's port 80
02and I allowed it already
02But I seriously don't know what to do with this stuff
What are you trying to do?
12Ok well what are you using first of all?
12WAMp?
02Apache
02Or whatever
02I'm TRYING
02>.>
12Er
12So you downloaded Apache and nothing else?
02Yes
02Does this http://122.106.102.39 work?
12No I already said it doesn't
02kk
12But that's the IP that you need
02Oh
02Thanks Arti (Can't even see her own IP XD)
12Here's a really good program you should use
12http://www.wampserver.com/en/
12It does all the hard work
02kk
12It'll put you online in no time..
02Thanks Arti

My dad didn't bother to give me a limited account on his computer, because he knew the sooner or later I'd get myself admin.
12how do you do that when you are on a limited account?
12>_<
Notepad.
12Huh?
Limited access never blocks notepad.
12Notepad..?
Use notepad to run CMD.
12and?
12what is cmd..?
Edit account accesses from CMD.
12>_<
12first
12what is CMD?
Command line.
12wheres that..?
In system 32.
12and where is that?
...WINDOWS folder.
12ok
12http://up.mibbit.com/up/klGBwrqP.png
12thats what it looks like
12wheres do i find the WINDOWS folder?
Your main drive, usually C drive.
12http://up.mibbit.com/up/27OJufCv.png

12is there a different way?

12to change my account type
05kk
man
i just modded the HECK out of my nerf gun
Probably, but microsoft didn't make design windows so anyone can just get admin in 5 minutes on anyones' computer.
it now shoots custom darts with huge fuckin' magnets on the end
So I wouldn't know about them.
Lol. O_o
well
80% of the time, 5 minutes
the other 20% could need up to an hour
12is it worth the risk?
12my dad might freak out on me
but if you have physical access to the machine you can do anything
she's trying to get access to programs
12change my account type from limited account
blocked by her dad the administrator
I told her how to change the admin password.
12to admin
12and really my dad is gonna kill me
/me returns

This is why I have my own computers so I don't worry about this shit
12do you think its worth the risk?

12how do i find key logger?
In fact, do you have a webcam?
12no
Damn.

s
the SAM library does
nope
12where can i find that?
the SAM lib at c:/windows/system32/config/sam does
and you can't alter or access it from within a non-administrator account
you would have to use a linux bootdisc
you don't want to do that.
seriously - just install a keylogger

12theres a hint for my dads password
12it says
12"Favorite #"
...
?
well
what is his favourite number
:P
12i dunno
12i should ask him
12: P
Make a program to cycle through numbers, lol.
pushed a wong button agian
brute force = fail
You could do that in a .bat, lol.
12um
12i cant really
12i wouldnt know how
12and i cant type every single one in
12wait
12is it possible?
12or are you joking?
I see
You set 1 as a variable, get it to try that as a password, if it works, have it stop, if not, it increases the number, and loops again. XD
12i dunno how to do that
Well you could do that, but I wouldn't know how to make it stop if it is the actual password.
haha
you can't do that in a batch file
and fuck, i just re-broke my nerf gun
12lol
Sure you can, I'll do it now.
12im gonna make a bat file
This thing gets senstive when it gets it's buttons pushed
it made a weird pop sound
12ok dari
12and its gonna keep saying dragons
12xDDD
You can use variables too. O_o
...
Crap.
Lol.
blergh
i don't know whether to re-re-re-fix my nerf gun now, buy a new one, or go to bed
Wth is a nerf gun?
4..
12is there another way?
12..
12well
Someone must have worked out how it encrypts the passwords. O_o
12^.^..
12I could do the changing passwords one
12cause my dad wouldnt know
12but ...>_>

Yeah, it ends up being a 20 digit hash or some crap like that, but surely someone must have worked it out by now? O_o
Hmmm
20 character*

Hi
12http://up.mibbit.com/up/4eBG00w8.png
12thats what i got
12i tried Login Dom
12i typed that
the quickest way to decode a hash into a password is by first extracting the hash from the SAM file, then computing it against a large (6-20GB) set of rainbow tables.
and that could take anywhere from half an hour to a week
...O_o
12telnet
12what is a telnet?
12o.o
12is there another way?
6gawd
12...
12*gulps*
12im changing his password
lol no
waaay too obvious
12lol yes
hey
tell me
12well theres no other way
are you running windows XP Home
12um..
12i dunno
12Microsoft Windows XP
12That's all.
eck
12I don't know about home.
/me 6prepares to get yelled at

12There's no other way.
hit ok
hi Kyu

12http://up.mibbit.com/up/T3zIUhuT.png
wtf
why are you running MCE
hold on
6STUPID MOFO
12i typed winver
6UGH
6I have to fucking go..D<
it just doesn't make sense that you are running windows media center
12Bye, C7 ;(
6D<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
hmm
6Bye..
well there's a known glitch with windows XP home
i'm not sure if it will work since you have MCE
12oh well
12its worth a try
12just tell me
but it's worth a shot
12yea so tell me
12xD
well
you need to restart your computer
and start tapping the F8 key as soon as it starts rebooting
12seriously?..
12then what'll happen
12: O
Oh, and change the password there.
LOL.
you should get a menu that shows options like safe mode, start windows normally, and a whole heap of other stuff
anyway when you get that menu
12then what?
select safe mode, and hit enter
You can change the password in the settings that come up. XD
I did that on my school computer.
It's either F2, F8, or F12.
No, I'm not.
it should come up with the normal user account screen
now if you're very very lucky, as well as your fathers' and your account, it will also have an Administrator account showing
12hurry up
12im writing it dowm
12x3
in which case you can click it, log into it without a password, and change settings to your heart's content.
12 8P
12FLDGPDFLG
12Thanks
12I hope it works
if it doesn't have it, just restart normally and come back here

The darkrai event is soooo old news
3rd of August you get a membercard via Wi-Fi
We didn't get one here >> or if we did, I was at work when it was on
ah, what do you do, just log on?
You go to the harbor place, and go to sleep. Only to end up at an unknown island to catch Darkrai (level 50)
Oh right, didn't know, thankies!
Will I be able to do so in Pearl? I hear it's platnium only, but not sure
nope, Platinum only
And it sucks they took the fruit machine gambling out of Platinum here, it was fun!
starts on the 3rd of August for the USA and Europe
Fail
I was NOT able to wait

when I accidently formatted my drive
Aero: Hai pplz~
3....
10Hai

12Oh yea
12I have a drawing tablet
12;3
12And requests are oepn
12*open

I typed in "sda4" instead of "sda5"
12drawing tablet+GIMP+me=amazingness, and rainbows.

3...
3Everyone makes mistakes
3No one is perfeect
LOL
12You're the one who asked
12x3
Its an honest mistake.
3The only being that's perfect is Zeus.
3but, even he has made mistakes
12being perfect
12IS A MISTAKE.
12:3
3I make mistakes, but, I can cover them up really easy
12you learn from your mistakes.
3yeah, Zeus is so old that, he can go without making them
3its loopholes
3Gods don't have loopholes
3they make one, and if they catch it, they go to the sisters of fate to fix it.
Aero: yesh
3I make such small loopholes that they require precision to notice
brb
3and anyway, they're easy to fix
3Loopholes and mistakes are difficult for me now...I can make ones on purpose for the hell of it.

worrying too much will just make things worse
12LOOOOOL
12The activity seems to have dropped a lot >v<
Uselly I use TST as a proving ground for my fan fictions before fan ficton.net
I like how I can go into it and change something I said with something better you can't do that on fan ficton.net
hai guys ^-^
07hi!
07I am here
oh hai arti! i went somewhere you would like today
oh hello there
have you ever visited paridise park when you lived in the south west?
Articuno I once saw at one time the black crows in my area battling it out with the Seagulls for control of the Kroger food store parking lot
7Tommy!
12No
12I've never actually heard of it
12Where is it?
its in cornwall in hayle
12Hayle, nah I rarely went there :>
Is it a national park?
its a sanctuary for birds
12O__o really..? I'll have to visit then
-.-
7You serve your pennance.
7I have a great memory for punishment.
they have tons of different birds there, i think you would really like it
and they have sessions at different times of day when they bring out a few of the birds to feed and stuff
I noticed -_-
they had this bald eagle that they rescued from a animal smuggler that couldnt go back in the wild
but you still don't remember why though
12Wow Ovo
That would be good this bird place at the Virginia Beach Aquarium has something like it too
i will go find the link to their webby
http://www.paradisepark.org.uk/
there we go
The link works
This is good I'm trying to get a list of places I should vist when I go to Europe one day
10I CAN'T DRAAAAAAAAAAAW
/me dies
thats definately a good place to go ^-^ also the eden project thats brilliant too
12I still haven't been there
12Thanks for the link
The Eden project I herd about that over here on the Discovery Channel that might be very cool to see in real life
12This looks lovey!
7I do not.
Articuno I made a drew a version of the anthro Cuno Girl looking foward last night
7NOTICE THE FACETIOUS COMMENT.
lol the eden project isnt to far away from me so i bouht myself a pass and i go up there all the time :3
The program about the Eden project was that they wanted to copy the idea of it and use it to movie Houston Texas inside of a giant dome like it
Meh
We also talked about the Eden Project in our Horltcuture class about green houses
12dinner back later
See you later Articuno
cya arti
Currently I'm baking a cake right now
7tell me something about the story, and I'll help you.
7PM me.
that sounds pretty cool, i wonder if they will put ones like it in other places
7It's incredibly unlikely I'll ever read more than the first chapter.
07bark

Hey Sliverwing
Sliverwing how have things been going today I had the cops show up at work

They were around this big SUV and I herd some very werid stories about it
No one that I saw got carried off in handculffs
So anything odd happen to anyone else?
10o-o

Hey Jess

I don't think I've ever talked to you on chat before Jess
probably not
I do want to ask you how do you draw your anthro pokemon so good
me?
Yep
i dunno, i just...drew it
Strangely I can take something all ready drawn and change them into differnt body postors and make their mouths move using a mix of photo delex and movie maker
i can never explain how i draw things, i just do
Yesterday I finnly made my own version of Articuno's anthro cuno girl looking towards the screen
It was hard work too
link?
When Articuno gets back I will ask her if I can post it
!lag
[Jess] Lag with nest.lugia.us is 0.951secs
!lag
What is Lag
Beaten D:
erm....
10lag is the ECHO TIME for your connection
Thank you I really don't much about the computer words or code
10It's basically how long it takes for a signal to reach the server and return to say it less jokish
laaaaaaaaaaaag

10eew
i gtg now guys
cya
My computer strangely likes loading this website faster then my own home page Comcast aka Comslow

Is it comcraptastic?
I really don't know my local cable company called Comcast
brb
They say they have new high speed internet but the cables on the poles in my area are at least 40 years old
k
Yes it is comcraptastic
How much do you people pay for internet?

hi
Hello.
Me too all I know is it comes with plugging the TV
See you later Altair
10hi
bundlez yay.
10wat?
Comcast bundle thing.
Talking about ISP.
/me is very happy with his current ISP
10Ok seriously
10wtf
I like mine, and wb.
10My ISP is awesome
10but my router is crap I suppose
10ty
I mean, other than some modem troubles we encountered some time ago, the AT&T DSL we get is good :D
10We have the same thing
As in the modem started overheating and it'd disconnect after overheating.
Then we'd have to unplug it and let it cool.
10Well, we got it before Bellsouth became AT&T
etc.
10o-O
We had dial-up for a long time
'till about late '06, early '07 or so.
10:C
10We got rid of dial-up in 2002
Strangely the boxes and wires on the side say Bell South on them
10I think
We weren't able to UNTIL that time
House say Bell South so that must mean they are very old
We live in a small rural town.
10Ah okay
I live in a surburb
sburb?
The cable company ins in a way lazy you will see the power company work on a power line and leave the cables hanging down to the street
10I live slightly north of the main city
10Of course, our power goes out all the time
I live in middle-of-nowhere, IN
I drive though that state sometimes on the way to Chiacgo
10I live in NC
03Back~
swb
Strangely if I were to go though a town or state I would be able to know if I'm home or not based off how the power line power poles look like
You sometimes go through IN?
10Rage.
To get to Chicago.
From Richmond.
Why would you go another way?
Indiana
...
I know what IN is
I know a short cut though West Virginia and Ohio
I also Stop at Dayton Ohio were the Largest air and space Musem is at in the US
I'm just wondering which way you take not to go through IN.
Meh, never mind.
10this is just stupid
Having fun?
8D
Instersate 65 and 70 and though Indainapolis
Indy?
Ever visited anything in Indy?
Yes That state the people drive the fastest the speed limit is 70 but everyone there seems to be going 90 to 100 miles on hour
Indianapolis = sometimes called the racing capital of the world. :D
Oh, and I live in 'that state'
:D
It's still nice to go though
Umbreon told me the roads are apparently nice
West Virginia is were the roads are nuts and you will see some really wild trolls on the highway
Define 'trolls'
12Little ugly beasts with big ears who live under bridges
The roads are very winding with sharp curves on the freeways and the speed limit is 70
I know that definition.
Articuno these trolls like to drink and drive in the duch
I've never seen or heard that term used that way.
My brother was driving on the West Virginia Turnpike and a man in a pickup truck goes flying past him at 90 miles on hour on the grass part of the highway
And he was in the left passing lane all ready as if 75 though the mountains wasn't fast enought for him
12Yeh that IS a funny way to use the word troll..
On top of that it's 36F in winter and the dude in the pickup truck has all his windows down
Look!
It's a b'oxish fellow!
Ok
07haihai
Hullo, Kyu.
?
What DS game should I get>
?*
zomg baked lays are the BEST
asking who? o:
Aero, I'm getting a new town
On ACWW
KIPI.
O: really?
And I was askingmin general
I do have a list of code words for driving on the freeway for things and people
brb. o:
hi.
I need to find my DS charger
?
Any idea for a DS download?
What do you mean?
A game
For the DS. XP
DS download?
Can you reccommend any?
A cop car parked on the road waiting for speeds is called the Catfish is in the Den
wut.
Sense Catfish hide out of sight and wait for prey to swim by then jump on them
You people have funny terms.
I haven't tried Chrono Trigger DS
When you think about getting on to Insterstate 95 I always say I were going to have to keep up with the Apes on 95
Fun game
How are you getting and playing said DS game?
Another one is the HOV lanes withe Diamond symble that resrict the number of drivers in a car is called the HBO Lane
Which is?
It's like a special highway lane that is for carpoolers in Northen Virginia you have to have more then one person in the car
I like Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin on DS, it's a bit short though.
Have all three Castlevania DS games
Elite Beat Agents? I've played it, it's ok, and quite a lot of people seem to think it's a good game.
Never tried
it
Guess I'll give it a go
It's based off of the HBO movie channel being that when we mention them that is what people usely think they are one in the same thing
k.
brb.
What kind of games do you like, anyway? RPGs?
When we see someone pulled over by a cop car we say they are picking over Fredy
GUEST?
Sure, we'll go with that
cya

Wow, your name is the same length as mine XD
02-.-
o.o
/me shot
iRAWR
Ovo
Shiny
That writing part, your tenses are wrong
It's "Lay" not "Lie"
Lie is the present tense, the past tense makes more sense
02Lay is like "I lay this down." Lie, "I went to go lie down"
LAY AND LIE ARE THE MOST CONFUSING WORDS IN THIS LANGUAGE.
Guest maybe?
D:
02Who and whom are too
I agree
with who/whom and lay/lie
and stuffs
02They're, their, there :3
02To, two, and too :P
They're, their, and there are the easiest set or words.
of*
who and whom are fairly easy
02They seem to be, yet I've seen so many mess up on them
To me, they are.
the there's are easy
It's and its are very commonly misused.
so are the to's
It's = it is, its = possessive form of it.
Alot is also used as one word a lot...
02English is just plain confusing
wait...
It's its toy.
8D
o_O
Which is correct.
Oh
Because it is its toy, being that 'it' in this case means two things, one the toy, the other the owner of the toy.
o.o
?
hi
hai
/me rawrz at Aero
DAMN YOU, YOU GOT ME ADDICTED TO TWEWY XD
/me shot

02I should leave soon, another part is startin to hurt x.x
07there's this swordfighting mode where you go against like, 50 people
07XD
07it's haaard
lol XD
There's too many games I want! DX
I reaaaaaally wanna see Drawn to Life 2, Gyakuten Kenji, KH: ??? days, Golden Sun DS, and Pokemon HG/SS. D:
07lol
02Havest Moon for Wii
Golden Suuuuuuuun
I had the first Drawn to Life
It's a great concept, but...
07you get a $5 gift card if you reserve KH 358/2 at Target
I'll harvest your moon and make your sun golden.
07XP
12Omg
I thought the first Drawn to Life had such cute characters. X3
:/
Could've been a lot better
lolKyu. XD
12I heard in Drawn to Life, it starts off as an RPG really cool looking, then it suddenly goes platform.. is that right?>
Agreed, Aero
yahuh
No, Arti
12Thats STUPID
No RPG elements
Spongebob's Drawn to Life is...eww
12What about the start?
Nope
12You start off walking around in a world with people
12Yeh you do, I've seen it
12You talk to them, just like Pokeymans
That's not RPG-ish. o.o
That's just talking in the home base area thing
12No because you walk around and go into houses etc
The one thing I hated most about that game is you don't get the sword until the very end
Yesh
02gtg now x.x
The black bats were what I hated a lot. D:
bai Shiny. D:
02I'm losing sight in one eye. Bye Aero
Arti, the thing you're talking about where you buy stuff in the store doesn't affect your stats.
They were just stamps and otjer goodies foe drawing
12No the start of the game
...
other* for*
12You go around with your friends and stuff, go to their houses, talk to them..
12It makes you think the rest of the game is going to be like that
???
12The start of the game....
Yeah
12you start with a friend, then she takes you to another friend through some woods or whatever
That's in the villiage
12and you all talk, then go off to find someone else.. etc.
12Yeh, well that's RPG style.
12Thats why the game sucks
Which you go back to after eacg level
each*
02hmm
wtf
Hmm indeed
/me rawrz at everyone
I have class now, so bye
^^
12I dunno how you can mix platform with RPG.. lame
I was disappointed with how the game turned out too, but it was fun while it lasted
Maybe the 2nd one will be a bit better?
It's on the Wii, so there's no way I'm getting it.
I'd rather get Metroid: Other M, or Masamune(or is ir Muramasa> o.o;;): Demon Blade
07paper mario was platform/rpg
12I've never played it
XP Still need to beat it
07it's really good
07not the one on the wii though lol
12Thing is
07the n64/GC ones
12Mario is MEANT to be platform, so adding RPG to a game that you alrady know is platform probably works
It's not that I lose interest, I just find another game and forget about it
12But when you get a game, and it starts off as a cool looking RPG, then suddenly goes to a crappily done platform game.. it sucks
I downloaded it on the Virtual Console
The last thing I did was finish the boss in the toy box. :3

Guest
and former guest Twilight
=D
4Up your butt, around the corner, through the tube in your boob, past the river in your liver, through the chest which is the best.
3That one sounds like what some person who's into the sexual practice of BDSM would say
4Actually it was past the test to reach the chest which is the best.
3But, still, if you harm your sexual partner
3you aren't a true pervert
3Tastes like chicken, keep on licking.
Lol, BDSM.

Hello is anyone on?
7I am.
Maybe
Hey
So how were things today?
7Odd.
Things were stranger then normal for me
Found this strange website about time zones
What about time zones?
It's strange how like were all talking to one another on here and everyone is at least two time zones away from anyone else and were still able to have a live chat
7Eh?
7Time zones are there to distinguish light. o3o
Strangely I remember hearing it was the railroads that wanted them and thought of the idea
Before that it wasn't out of the question for every town to have there own time
06QWEHYGT
I think you're right about that, because it was confusing for people taking trains (and the workers), when all the different towns had their different times. It must have been chaos. O_o
06Ovo
I don't think I've ever seen a good 3D movie. O_o
/me 7sighs
7Wow, I've had less than 100 posts in the month of July.
7Blah to lack of free time. (or too much of it)
7http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3912.0
7If any KH fans are interested.
I'm woundering how do you get your name made perment on here?
7Do you mean registering?
Yes so my name can be on the side list
7It isn't on the side? o3o
7It should be.
I see it. O_o
I think it is on the side
But dose it give sistics of my name
7Oh, statistics?
Now I see it
Now about those 3D Movies I noice they are hard to find
Time to get some sleep, I think.
Cya
Bye
/me 7smacks Dari upside the head
7brb
That's an interesting greeting.
6lol
7Indeed.

oo
/me is drawing a Chibi Twili x3
7AND, what the hell happened to all that DM coding you promised to do?
7you promised to fix classes and do an exp/level system.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Dk81UWwAo&feature=related <- oO;
I was at my grandparents house.
My uncle actually decided to turn up, and I haven't seen him in 3 years.
He's impossible to track down.
We were speculating that he was working for MI5.
XD
7Lol
Nope
/me 7cannot be bothered with the evil routine today
7stupud headahce
Could be Zurick, New Zealand, anywhere.
Ok
Anyway, if you're prepared to wait, I'm learning AS3, and I can make it in that.
It would be better if I had someone to do graphics, animations, etc.
7she comes on here now.
7you may be able to catch her at one poin5
7point*
/dm
/j #dm
12i can animate
12Btw.
12:)
Apparently he went and saw Machu Pichu.
12:') So proud of myself..
And went white water rafting on the Zambizi river.
o_o
7... I really need some PokÃ©mon jokes if there's a place called Machu Pichu
He doesn't even have a house, he doesn't stay in one place long enough to own one.
It's hard to tell really, when he goes somewhere, whether it's business or pleasure.
In Peru.
12k then.
12Guess not
What?
Well, to a certain extent, LOL.
12-.-
12I know how to animate
12That's that.
No good unless it's done in flash.
12nope
12GIMP works.
12too
It screws up otherwise.
12meh.
12not really
12:)
I'm telling you, importing stuff not made in Flash makes stuff really screwed up.
12>_>
12Not on GIMP
12ask me to animate anything
12and ill do it
12-.-
It doesn't matter what it's made on, importing it into Flash screws it up. I know what I'm talking about.
Especially .gifs...Eurgh, gifs...
12what else can i save it as then?
12;\
You can't, GIMP doesn't do vectors, I don't think.
12im making an animation for my avvie right now
When it comes to Flash Vectors > Bitmaps.
By a looooooooooooooong way.
12you can animate in those?
12o_O
Almost all Flash animations are vectors.
Professionals use vectors too... O_o
12ALRIGHT.
12SHEESH
12:\
Well you were the one insisting that you could make animations that would work well in Flash.
12i thouht i could
12>_>
12and don't put words in my mouth.
I didn't, you did it for me.
12I didn't say I could make them well to be in flash.
12Where?
12that was me and my opinion.
12>_>
6Wtf
6When'd all this happen!?
Yes, you said you could make animations for Flash.
12Well, misplaced words then.
12I don't know.
12morning everyone~
10Hey

12g2g...byes~
07So I read something about the government is hoping people over there in the UK will start bee keeping, in an effort to help honey bees survive. Any of you guys plan to do it?
__o
2I hate my mouse, I have decided.

Agh
I cant type we
ll
brb
6o_O
6I feel weird
07Yeah, some company even started making plastic "hives" so people can put them in their gardens and whatnot
07They are pretty expensive.
Rora, my father was a beekeeper, as was his father before him - and I want to follow in their footsteps.
Unfortunately, Roara, their steps were something like this:
/me runs around screaming "AAAAAA! I'M COVERED IN BEEEEEEEEEES!"
07LAWL!
6God no..I'm obsessed..D:
/me bows. "Thankyew, thankyew!"
12Really?
6Yus
07You're silly
12Cool.
07 xD
6Meh.I'd rather not to be obsessed with either..>.<
12That's good.
...
07I wonder if my lazy kid is still sleeping
Probably, yes.
07If I try to wake her before noon, she asks why she has to get up early.
/me 6drums in midair
07Hi guestie
07Oh, wb ll
12turns out I don't have to leave :\
12thankies~
2o.O
07So that company named the plastic hives "beehaus" and they cost about $850 US.
07Isnt that like 500 pounds?
6lol
6I'm slightly hyper atm..
6:P
2Something to do with LP, Robbie says
2He likes to read people's minds, I keep telling him not to D:
6o__O
6that's expensive
07I know. And that doesnt even include the bees!
07At least you'd get a bunch of fresh honey.
6WTF
6How'd you know I was watching LP..O_O
12Kids, tattoos are awesome, get some NOW!
6Stupid fucking inscense stick
2Robbie said it, not me
6It kinda melted on the keyboard
2Ooh, tattoos :D
2WTF
2Haha I remember when my sister and I were burning an incense stick and I popped my stress ball with it :|
6Why the hell did I have to get the obsession with mike Shinoda? Isn't the on with Billie already enough!?
12http://up.mibbit.com/up/oiH3RDLm.gif TEST ANIMATION
6but why would anyone spend that much on a hive when you can buy honey at the store
6O_O
6of course.........that is what alot of people say nowadays about anyhting
12SHIT
12ITS GRAY
6Wut?
6O_O
2And with fake blood everywhere I told my sister to watch the stick and dont let it burn while it was resting on the rim of a candle that was burning.
2IT CAUGHT FIRE DAMMIT.
7that is the single shittest animation I've ever seen
2 2 different pictures. WOOOOOW.

6Crap
6brb
Asdafloof
07Uh, not my usual. Right now Im listening to Ayo-technology by 50 cent/Justin Timberlake
Heh, I'm listening to Machinae Supremacy's "SIDstyler" myself :P
07Never heard of them.
6Gawd
www.machinaesupremacy.com
2o.O
6"Fill th bottles so I can have water to drink when I wake up."
6-______-
They did the soundtrack for Jets'n'Guns, and their track "Cryosleep" was used in one of the In The Groove games (I want to say it was ITG2)
07Are you misspelling machine or is that A supposed to be there?
6*the
6Now I kinda can't breathe again
07Ok, just checking for when I look it up later.
6STUPID
6FUCKING
6SMOKE
6D<
07Im listening to the SPAWN soundtrack now. "Trip like I do"
My Greek auntie, and uncle's business is about to go under.
2O_O
IIRC, that version was a joint production, done by Filter and The Crystal Method.
They're going to lose their house, this other place they own that I've never been to, boat (if they haven't already sold it), and stuff.
6Ok,now I need to stick my head in the fridge again..
6D: @ Dari
Apparently they already have something sorted though.
07I know. I just wasnt sure who was old enough to know that. Or like that type of music enough
2o.O
(Somewhere to stay)
2Oh noes!
My other auntie on my mother's side runs the family business.
12brb~
/me 6is starting to get pissed off by the memory of her dad telling her that she'll have to sniff the fucking smoke till she's around 8
6*18
07Its funny, I will play cool songs that Cynder thinks are new, but they are almost as old as her! xD
Flush his cigarettes (sp?) down the toilet.
6lol
6like what?
2o.O
Oh, one of my favorite Machinae Supremacy tracks just came on . . .
6Yeah,I'd like to but then I'd get in REALLY big trouble..not to count the fact that my mom smokes too..-.-
DEATH FROM ABOVE
6Ok..this is getting worse..
2o.O
6I need to go to the fridge..
Well, on the also-not-so-bright side, you might not have to wait until 18, with all the smoking they do.
07Sneaker Pimps, "Spin,Spin Sugar"...Deftones, "My Own Summer"...Drowning Poll, "Tear Away" to name a few.
07*Pool
2My dad smokes, its really annoying cos it makes me cough like... Jimmy
6lol
6Yeah..I'll probably be dead before I turn 18..-.-
6I've actually never heard of those, so I'll assume they're old
6XD
I meant him, but yeah, passive smoking too, I suppose.
6He doesn't even believe I have a problem
2Problem?
Buy a fan, and blow the smoke back at them.
07The first one is more techno than hard but they're all cool. And still producing hits now.
6He says that I only complain about not breathing well when everyone else can't breath well either,because of the heat
2Do you have asthma?
6Well at points I kinda have a hard time breathing..
07Those particular songs are around 10 years old though.
6I had it when I was six but that was because of the really low tempature
6I think this thing has to do with their smoking though..
6Wait..
6Ok,now's my chance to get some fresh air..
6brb
6Better
07Im listening to Alice in Chains now
07"Mouth" by Bush now.

06KEYQUEST TIEMS.
Aww see I'd have screamed the place down LL and have done in the past upon sight of them LOL
Think of Misty in the show lmaop
12lolz

I have a friend who's scared of spiders, which is why I intend to buy a tarantula.
12I don't scream, I flail(sometimes) and run
I've tried to hold a tarantula and had to run out of the room for its sake
hehe
12I'm not usually scared of spiders, but those were HUGE o_o
06I just one failed.
06D:<
Evil raisins with legs, I call them.
06That's when you roll a one in keyquest.
06D=
We found that they had a tarantula in this museum (school trip), and took him to see it, when he saw it, he ran a mile.
That was fun.
He was staring at the glass box for a while, because he couldn't see what was in it, lol.
I have a dilemma now - I need to take the dog out but there's tons of flying ants and I don't want them to get in my hair or anything. Need a balaclava LOL I'll try later
lol
06More onefail.
12good luck, RN :\

6I saw it again last friday
6*saturday
Hi.
12hai Ragna~
The creepiest incident I've had with a spider, is when my mum suddenly pulled my chair back, and I saw one of the large spindly legged spiders dangling right where my head had just been... Eurgh, for days after that, I kept checking the ceiling, to see if any were above me.
6I've had some funny stories with spiders XD
/me pokes to silent chat
hi Skylands
12hai Sky~
6in like 7th grade when my friend and I were in math class. We were just listening to the teacher when this spider drops from the ceiling right into her math book. She starts freaking out silently, loud enough for me to hear but the teacher was oblivious. I shouted "I GOT IT!" And slam her book shut, squishing the spider inside.
6The whole class looked at me like I was crazy. That spider is still squished there to this day I'm sure.
XDDD
6and then just a couple weeks ago when a spider dropped in my face from the ceiling as I was walking down the hall. I spazzed and ran right into the wall. The spider happened to be on my nose when I did tat, and it got squashed XD
O_o
lolew O:
06EW.
06RORA.
06EBRG4D
when I lived in mah old place before I moved here, I used to catch spiders around my house and just keep them all in the same jar. XD
LOL
6don't worry, I scrubbed my face after XD
6LOOOOL
Did they eat each other? o_O

13wtf is a graphics card
12..Are you a serious? o_o
2Card in computer that displays graphics?
12Yea, thats the one
12XD
2Mah friend sharon has the exact same laptop as me, bought it from the dell.co.uk shop as well, and it has a really crap graphics card so it doesnt even play the sims 2 :|
2FAIL
13sims looks like it would get boring after 10 minutes
2The sims 3 is rubbish, it's not very different to the sims 2 at all
12actually.
12It does get boring eventually..

12I just know this..
12Windows
Then I can't help you.
12Something like that.
2FAIL
Windows is the operating system.
2Are you on the laptop which is the same as mine?
12Nope.
Doesn't do you much good in figuring out the graphics card.
Is it a laptop\?
12That's getting fixed
12No.
13oh
OK, then its a desktop.
2Inspiron 1525 :D
12Um.'

Hi Ecco ^^

12i thought it would help me KNOW my graphics card cause thats what the site said..
12fucking lying site.
No, its a driver.
12Ughh.

12aw crap
12D:
Stop wrecking your computer and ask your parents to help you.
12My dad said he doesn't know about the computer much, before.
12My mom said she doesn't have a CLUE because she doesn't even go on.
12no
13call dell support or something
12looking up how to find out what kind i have on google
13don't believe everything you read either
why would I do that? You do it.
Look on your pc, it will have stickers all over the place.
On the back, theres usually a sticker that lists a serial number and model number
12do you want both?
12..I mean need both?
13huh
12all i saw was "rev A00
2Just the model number. Serial no = irrelevent to case.

Hey
/me works on raising Chocobos in FFVII
that's a fun minigame
I have 3 Black Chocobos, 2 Gold Chocobos, and a Blue Chocobo.

why would you want more than one gold chocobo? D:
LOL XD I like Gold Chocobos. ^^
ic
coolio
I just did it all once to get the gold myself
I already defeat the Emerald and Ruby WEAPONs, so I prefer to raise Chocobos to pass the time.
the number of gold chocobo only areas is mildly dissapointing imho
and ic
hey Skylands!

Death is worse... Actually death is peaceful.
cya
What was your most painful experience?
I'd say when I slid a disc
...What? O_o
and pinched a nerve
I had a nerve spasm!
x3
I don't know what you mean by "slid a disc".
it's when one of the discs in your spine comes out of place
Ouch.
yeah
that sucked bad
I've heard that pinching nerves is extremely painful.
it's true
And dislocating your shoulder (My friend has done that).
I've done that as well
Ouch.

Nothing, I like making that face at peoples.
2lol ok
But only sometimes.
O:
you might want to have the doctors check that again
I don't know what my most painful experience is, one of the most serious has to be cuts from glass, although you don't feel that at all.
I'm seriously just gonna ban that idiot

Dislocated*

dislocations happen all the time in football
you just pop them back in
I know but
It was bad
It was hot, and we used the hose to wet the slide on the climbing frame we had, I was on the frame, fell off, my arm got slashed quite a bit.

I dunno, I just felt stupid.
Ah..

06I remembered black skies, the lightning all around meee~

06I needs...
/me noms on Cynder's ear
06Uhm..
The blade before him – dark purple in colour, seemed to emanate a dark aura, so strong the feeling of energy in the air was nearly tangible. As the man laid his right hand on the hilt of the blade, he felt an immense surge of power enter his body. He chuckled to himself darkly, before slipping away, into the shadows. Now that he possessed the sword, the time for revenge had finally come...
06Which one?
/me noms on Cynder's ear again
06FEWDS.

06Toast.
06:D
I can tell you everything about Ika
/me sits on Feather
06Hidan plz
06:D
Ok, tell me.
If you'd like to see how well I know my first RP character
XD
10I'm making another pic with you in it :D
Give me a sec to type
10=DD
Ika is black with two blue scars over each eye, he also has blue stripes on his muzzle, all his ankles and tail. he has three "tiger" stripes on his belly. He's a dragolf. A wolf/Dragon. He also wears a cloth necklace with a dark purple crystal on the end. He's also blnd, but uses his sense of smell and his mind's eye to see.
He's about four feet tall to the shoulder, with his wings out-stretched, about nine feet.
Full name: Ika Nurabashi Kyuu
He's only 2 years old in Dog years, but fights like a ten year old. He's like 16 in human years.
You don't want to know his story.
Wow, quite a lot of information.
It would take YEARS to write
XD
And thanks
10Of course, it's birds only, since I can't draw anythin else
Ika's iris's are a light grey, by the way.
its late here, night all
I think I have his story written down somewhere
*Looks*
I wonder if there's anything you haven't thought of, lol.
Hm...
Oh yeah
!
I forgot
Family?
Uh....
Yeah
I know all his family
D:
He's also got two "saber" fangs, his claws are about two inches long each.
My tennis teacher can't make it, and I'm already in socks and tennis clothes...
His tail is also longer than a regular wolf's.
/me hugs Crain back
:3
10:>
He's wise, but very curious.
10(just don't evolve it, or I WILL find you!)
He loves to read, believe it or not. He
's risked his life to teach his mind's eye
/me evolves it and flees to Pluto!
YES!
I found his story
XD
06Oh wait, I forgot my space suit x.x
/me suffocates
Wow, you thought out a lot.
Okay, well a long time ago, there was only a small pack of Dragolves, then the Dragons attacked it. All of them died except for Ika and his Father, Tosainai. Tosainai is a Dragon-Wolf, not a dragolf. He has the ability to shift into either one.
/me takes Sky and flies back
Well Tosainai wanted to harness Ika's power for evil, since Ika is a Darkness Dragolf. Ika refused, and ran off, away from his father. He then met a dragon named Eon, and soon fell in love, but another wolf came along, Silver. Eon's destiny was with him, but her father, also evil, wanted her with Ika, because he knew Ika's father. Tosainai, who was tracking
ka the whole time, took control of him, and forced him to attack Eon and Silver...

06Unborn dragons are actually ready to hatch early on in their development cycle. However, they choose to remain in the safety of their own egg rather than leave it. If a developed dragon is forced out of its egg prematurely, it will usually run away or hide immediately.

12oh, ok
12I'm sorry to hear that :(

Mr.Smile is a character who shows in my fan fic Invastion of the Anthro Ninetails and A Week as the Only Human at the Sky Temple
12wb Espy
Hey Espy
06ello and thanks
Espy I have a strange question about the power line poles in your area are the insulators on top of them Glass or Clay
06errrrr
06I think the power lines are underground
06;/
That's no fun I asked becouse I saw on this website that giant glass insulators are still used and made in Europe
06Yeh, if i wasnt in a city, you would be correct
I did built a divice that allows me to stand on the ground and uncrew the insulators off the old falling down telegraph poles
Here is a photo of what glass giants of the insulator world could be living on the power poles http://www.insulators.info/pictures/?id=147448536
06nice :P
12BBL~
kk
When ever I'm in a place that has insulators everything is fair game
This dosen't mean I'm going ot clumb a high voltage pole it means I go to the power company and dig though their dumpsters
How is everyone doing today?
bored X/
I've been hunting insulators on ebay today
I'm kind of bord I've spent almost all of this week on the computer
Hey EcooCode

I told you, this is a test for my AS3, if I can do this, then I'll do DM in AS3.

Yep.
Anyway, I want ideas. :P
I will see everyone later I'm going to go crash aroudn the fourms and the internet
7I dislike sniping games. I'll give you ideas for a lot of stuff, but sniping games are rediculous and repetetive "SHOOT THE GUY IN THE FACE CUZ HES DOIN BAD STUF."
Well, actually I was thinking of having you have to shoot someone with a baby in one of those buggy things.
Sort of to test your resolve I suppose.
7... STILL.

Yaaaaay XD
06WHAT?
06I could hear the nickalert from the kitchen.
12My theory is if you install something, and it isn't there, you just downloaded a virus.
06D:<
12Congrats,
12^_^
13Do you remember the talking Bubbles?
07speakers that loud?

13it's a site where you can draw with 1 or more people
13it's fun
13Only in humans and a few other species are the females "pretty". Mostly the males look better to try to attract a female.

I caught a shiny krickitot within 20 minutes of starting a new game. :D

12Lucky.
speaking of being rare: Does anyone of you have an Hippopotas?
And I only had one pokeball left
12Probably caught one and it's in a box somewhere, why?
because I'd like to have one^^
02My friend was VERY lucky. He found the game on the ground the day AFTER it came out, and right after he got his pokeballs he runs into a shiny starly -.-

7I haz question. How do people dodge a laser when it's light, and therefore moves at the speed of light? Question was brought up in a Transformers episode when Starscream had a screaming fit when Optimus and someone else combined to form the Megazord and got really quick. And they dodged them.
12Yellow. Aaah
8YES
8YELLOW.
9Rule of Funny?
You dodge a laser by moving faster than the speed of light. :P
How do people dodge lasers?
/me 10grabs her color again.
10: o
Not all lasers move that fast.
As pure light would.
12I will use white.
7Dari: So you go to warp speed to dodge a laser? Won't that put you in mars?
Maybe.
0Hello, you bastard.
0Hahaha

9Have you been to the site before?
And I admit I was kind of rude to the guy when I denied it, but he was just so annoying and he didn't have his facts close to straight. And so I got out fine, which was good. And no, never been there before this.
06I think so.
06>v>

It wasn't my choice, the guy who drove me wanted to go there.
06...?
7It's a perfect edit.
06Good whats?
I should stop babbling on about this now. ._.
12How old was that guy?
06About WHAT?
Valenth
The one who drove?
Personally, I like Valenth more than Dragcave. o:
12Yes.
Twenty-something, why?
12Oh, okay. Good.
I've worked out that when accused of something, if you get really pissed off quickly, then people think you are lying.
7No-one will comment on my perfect message fabrication?
fkasdfkldfksfkdalsdk How is it that I keep killing this chat?! D:
12If he was underaged, you would have been in some serious trouble.
Yeah, basically we were gonna came out in a place, then he wanted to go somewhere else because there was wi-fi, lol.
02I'm too busy re-reading the comments on my art XD
06D:<
/me wants more to comment ;v;
06I like Dragcave more than Valenth.
*prolly
7No-one will comment on my perfect message fabrication?!
06I rarely get any comments, Shiny.
Apparently not.
9I can't see it.
I guess not.
06And most of them are on my PROFILE. D:<
7Then I hate you all.
07I think people that use either are failures!
Lol.
/me runs
12It's good to have some fun once in a while during these boring summer days.
I thought you already did.
XDD
7... fair point.
9No, I can't view images on here
06Because you don't even know what Valenth is about.
He hates ALL of us...? I think not.
/me chucks another pickle at Kyu
06And because you don't know how addicting Dragcave is.
06@v@
LOL
06RORA.
wb Aurora~

/me pokes Roara's Slifer
7.... fucking smileys.
06MIEN NAOS.
/me steals him
06:D
9XD
12Gotta love the smileys.
07dragcave is for people that want attention by making people click their eggs
02Tis nice drawing XD *needs to comment more on Roara's art*
06Ovo
7That's better.
06I don't make people click my eggs.
There was a Battlefield: Vietnam?
06They don't even NEED clicks to grow.
Never saw it.
12Yes, there was.
06Just views and unique views.
12I've played it ... it's pretty cool.
07it's the same thing
06No.
02Chaining is for showing off shinies :D guess that's attention too
Awesome.
Well, I'll be right back.
06No, Shiny.
06Chaining is for FINDING shinies.
07you can't view without clicking a link
12Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield 2 are better, though.
06So?
/me steals slifer back
06You can only view by going to a scroll.
02You find the shinies then you show them off, it all "links" together *shot*
06NOT the egg/hatchling itself.
I had a dream involving the egyptian god monsters O______o;;
/me steals Slifer again
/me glomps
lol
6and the shanti virus from heroes season 2 >_<;
07the concept is still stupid no matter how you put it lol
"The hardest part of my job is trying to link Iraq to the war on terror" <--- Most awesome Bush quote ever.
02The creators loved Slifer more than any of the egyptian gods XD
6it was an interesting dream....and one I succeeded in falling back asleep for and continuing
Amazing how stupid he was.
9rotfl
6seriously?
06Slifer is a god.
06:D
07dragcave just makes money off people looking at sprites
9That made my day
06A Crimson, Sky Dragony god.
6dude, dragcave stinks, end of story
12Leave Bush alone, you dunbass.

12*dumbass
06No it doesn't.
07no, Cynder
06It's fun to collect them.
06:D
07Slifer is an executive producer
07XD
Why, because you love the idiot?
06Ovo
02The main character used him all the time. And in Yugioh GX the main character was in the Slifer dorm for the entire season
06No he's not.
6THAT'S fun, but the overall idea is horrible
06D:<
07Osiris is a Sky dragony god
12Yes.
07they changed the name
06No.
Anyway, there's a video of him actually saying that.
06Slifer.
06<3
6Osiris isn't a dragon >_>:
06Slifer is betterer.
12Good for you.
6unless this is something else we're talking about
6o__O
07the real name is Sky Dragon of Osiris
9I don't hate him, but he wasn't a fit president.
6seriously?
06...
06>v>
06No.
06Not seriously.
12I believe he is better than Obama.
07the egyptian gods belong to the real gods
06D=
LOL!
06Slifer is still BETTER.
06He's...
06Just...
06BETTER.
06:d
12Obama was voted mainly because people want a first negro president.
06*:D
12the pop culture like black people.
Almost anyone would be better than Bush.
07Obelisk the Tormentor is originally god soldier of obelisk
Even McCain.
6it makes sense
6I'm drawing a blank on the blue god's name
6what's it's real name?
6does it involve anubis? XD
9Except Palin.
Eurgh.
07Roara
6ya that's what i thought
07I just said it
07XD
02Obelisk?
02XD
12Then, when Obama spent over a billion dollard in his first month, people realised what they have done wrong.
/me 6went through a year of Egyptian Mythology in 5th grad
6e
It's called cleaning up the mess Bush made.
12Wrong.
02Why do I keep mixing up Obelisk and Exodia?!
No, right.
6Obelisk
How much do you think the war he started costs to fund?
6shiny exactly
6I did the same thing, resulting in me not remembering the name
12How retarded.
How would you know? Have you got an itemized bill of everything the money was spent on?
12Bush knew how to deal with the war correctly, and by not using up a whole lot of funds.
Bush was the idiot that started the war.
12Wrong again. The terrorists did.
He only started it to get rid of Sadam, clearly, as he'd lost control of him, and he didn't like that.
13Wow, are you guys seriously fighting over that
07lol
13Hi
06FLEA.
13OBAMA
12Bushe's reactin was him realizing what the Iraqis are going through, how they are being tortured and ruled by terrorists.
13*oh the irony*
02I remembered Obelisk's name, and resulted in me forgettin Exodia =.=
FEATHER~
02Hey Feather!
06FLEAFLEAFLEAFLEAFLEA. FLEA FLEA, FLEA FLEA.
06:D

/me wants a ~
06:D
10CYNDER~

06:DDDDD
/me hugs back~
06FEATHER~
02Cynder is picky :P
13LOL
/me flees

06D:<
13To you it does
06YOU SUCK.
13It's kind of sad.
/me glomps the dead Slifer
9It IS>
07blame the anime
/me brings him back to life somehow :D
07you dork~
12I'm saying that Bush's actions were partly based on his actions.
/me flees
/me ranted about ranting on a topic and evolved into a full fledged hypocrite :D
06You're a dork.
12***
06You WATCHED the anime.
/me is shot
12oops
10ROARA
02wb Roara, again
12His religion.
wb Aurora~
06Wb.
9Religion is the cause of wars!
stupid karpin internet must die in a field of lava
anyways
06FLEA.
Slifer's real name isn't the SKY dragon
06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/Voi.png
06:D
07that was kinda funny though
rather, Heaven's dragom
02Nice to see you too Roara XD
12The wrong religion. Muslims and Aetheists.
07Bakura's monster blasted Slifer's head off
07XD
Well yes, it causes quite a lot of wars, but it's more of an excuse for war, rather than the cause, the causes are mainly greed for land.
10HO-OH
13what good's religion when it's eachother we despise? :P
10=D
06=3
06Voi~

'-'
13EH OH
6Winged God Dragon of Ra
13USA = BAD NAO HURRHURR
12It's a comedy show, by the way. People say stuff that's supposed to be funny. Yet I will say that the wuote is a bit uncalled for.
06SHADDAP.
06WE'RE HAVING FUN. D=
6since when does the sun falcon own a pet dragon? X3
/me is shot
Lol.

06You're gonna die.
06D=
6BLUE EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!! 8D
6I spoiled what?
10Kyu
I don't think anyone knows what Obama's religion is, if he has one. He just says he favors any one of them that would gain him more votes.
12I got off course.
whos seen yugioh 5d
06I don't see Blue Eyes as a White Dragon.
10-_-
6EW 5D
02Ness can keep his bat! *flees*
12the Fag religion.
06More of a Silver dragon with extreme blue tint.
7Oh my. It appears he's ignoring me because he knows I'm right but he's a stubborn bastard.
06:D
Not in SSBB o.o
10mostly sticks but he gets bats
07iDuncare
/me 6protests for original story/characters

6Cynder, it's more majestic
06D:<
06SWBDER45JDS
12Can't find it.
6and it's named after.............someone
Meeeeeeeeep
imagen goku in yugioh
06No.
02The person's soul who is in Blue eyes had blue eyes and white hair I believe
06It's named after a person.
/me flees from the spoilers
06Not Someone.
06D:<
/me is shot
leave to get her lol
he gest stars in other jap ammy
Mark McLeod claimed he was secretly engaged to the actress after he was arrested last month trying to sneak onto the set of her latest movie The Last Song.
02No, she died and put her soul into the dragon, and its eye are supposedly blue because of it
12"The hardest part of my job is trying to link Iraq to the war on terror"
12How is that bad?
Pineappleeeeeeeee
9...seriously?
thanks
meep?
Because he admits that Iraq isn't linked to terrorists, and he just started a war because he wanted to get rid of Sadam, as he'd lost control of him.
06http://www.geocities.com/jehuty21xx/blue_eyes_white_dragon.gif << Does that look white to you? XD
6someone I can't mention without spoiling something in the final arc XD
6shiny spoiled it for me
6that's why the dragon is "loyal" to kaiba
6kaiba had saved her in ancient times
Uh...no.
Well, for the first rule.
12Besides the hand jobs.
I think?
o_O
its ranark
hi drf who is a t camp along with the other drf who is still here
02Yep :P
13Apparently Jesus loves me and will forgive me for my sins but he wants me to burn in the firey pits of hell for being naturally attracted to females.
07Bakura reversed time lol

/me didn't even click it, lawl
13But Jesus loves EVERYONEEEEE
13Nawt.
You talk BULL-SHIT.
He loves the person, not the sin.
:P
12He does.
You're such an idiot
13Fucking fail

06YOU'RE an idiot.
06:D
6no, but the blue is, as you said, shading

06D:<
The Bible, which was written by people.

13THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY A RANDOM MAN NAMED BOB OR PAUL CENTURIES AGO
9The Bible says I'm a plumber.
6wat?
6I lagged again?
12Kj, I'm being asked a huindred Qs right now.

06Yep.

Before I win this argument, would you all like it if I stayed out?
07loooool

02Bleh, brb need to get somethin to drink to get rid of my breathin problems
13I love the Franklin bookseries. Franklin the cartoon turtle is now my God. I worship him because he is cool and in a book. Yay!
You don't have a denomination?
All right, only I'm not on any of your sides.
Yeah
06AC:WW and stuff.
06:3
02hidan
12Use Dicionary.com and look it up.
10YES
06HIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN.
10VERY MUCH
/me glomps
XD
06Naobais.
10=D
:P
That's the Flash
Kill us all lol
12More than.
OK, ask a question, I'll answer it to the best of my ability.
And then I made the audio CD-quality and not crap Flash quality
if you want... it's only like 4MB LOL
10lol
13Oh, those were the days.
13:P
iv seen it 1bill times gets brring lol
boring*
bang
Lol.
biiig bang
10true, but it's still epic.
A black hole.
12Where did that matter come from?
yeah
exactly
and such an addicting song
It was created, not spontaneously but by a planned work.
yh
A black hole.
SCIENTOLOGY FTW :P
I've been looping it
10oh god
12there had to be something to be created for the explosion to take place.
like still alive
A black hole.
10the sounds quality - it's AWESOME LOL
12It's called Creation.
There's a black hole at the centre of all solar systems.
Including ours.
A big one.
Yeah
12Where did that black hole originate from?
It always irks me that Flash videos use crappy mono audio... and they usually do a super low bitrate
13Itself.
mainly black holes are collapsed dead suns
10"UltimateshowdownHD"
10WHAT
Since no one can agree on if the universe was created at once or over a very long time, I think it would really difficult to explain what the porcesses necessary to even constitute as creating would be, since we're not sure if all objects were made the same way.
so I just decompiled it, opened it in Adobe Flash, and replaced it XD
Yeah
*processes
I made that account
Myuu~
10BUT
10why LOL
12Everything needs an origin. If it doesn't, it never existed.
brb
Who says?
What's God's origin then?
10oh god HD chuck norris
yeah
were the fuck did he come from
LOL
10damn it, i had finally forgotten that video >:(
brb
Yeah, the thumbnail picture sucks :/
7One theory of the end of the universe is that it will collapse in on itself. So much matter converging will probably result in a new big bang. This universe could be the result of the death of an old universe.
10lol
There maybe an origin for everything other than the first thing that existed,
13If you say God created him/herself, then you fail.
12He was always there. Something that human minds can't fully get a grasp on.
Which might very be God, but then obviously no one knows where He came from.
12there wasn't nothing, but only God.
13FAIL
12THING
God has no origin, and therefore does not exist.
13FAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAILFAIL
12God always existed.
For this portion.
13FAIL
12There was no starting point in the existence of God.
Does it even matter where God came from?
9Except when the Bible was rejected as a kid's book
13I want to punch a baby's lights in
9I want to kill a baby
I don't care, anyway.
13FORM OF: A GIANT EAGLE!
12Here.
13Oh, a website, yeah, that's DEFINITELY valid proof.
/me sits all over Roara
:P
02hihi
Demonatic? Lol.
o_O
02Hiya Umbreon
7I think I preferred it when you weren't here. Then we didn't have a twelve year old abusing her power and screaming everywhere.
7...
7I like dari's idea.
02Yes! Food! *noms on pizza*
9ike the web admin of that site?
12No human being will ever be perfect.
9*Like
7what I don't understand is why it's so abhorrent to both sides as to why God can be the why, and Evolution could be the how.
13Then quit acting like it.
12I'm not perfect.
^ Yup.
yay, 2 clicks away from beta. x_x
=O
er... Imma shut up and go away now. ._.
But there are some big variations, lol.
lol? o_O
12Yes, there are.
07XD
It's all basically the same.
/me bunnehpokes!
Not really.
/me flails
12Do your studying, Prince. It may seem like there are many similarities, but they can be quite different.
13No one will ever know which religion is true or if there is even a true one, and people that insist that their religion is the "true" one really piss me off.
/me bunnehhugs
/me pokes Aero
God made the world, set down some rules (various different ones, in each of the religions) God, Messiah, Son of God, etc, etc. Sin, blah blah blah.
12Not until they die.
/me 6splodes
6I love debates
12Ever heard of the Trinity?
Okay
o_O
yes.
Kyu's sitting all over you Roara
[14:07:39] * %Kyu sits all over Roara
Or something. o_O;;
6sorry, I'm posting in the "legendary beast" discussion
6ya I know
6that's why I splodes
Righ I can't be arsed to read if this has been said anymore but here goes:
That's the biggest difference, and of course there are radicals of Islam who think they have to wipe out entire countries, lol.
=O
6*sploded
02Ranting on ranters is fun too! *shot*
But it's the same with any of them, they just go too far.
12Good.
There's a difference between believeing abortion is a sin for example, and shooting up doctors in a hospital because they're doing abortions.
13"Good."
BRB
We have our views on our religions, you have yours, we are only saying that we don't understand why we have to suffer in most ways over your beliefs, we don't need a lecture about it.
13OVERPOPULATIONNNN
10Yes. Yes it is.
Look i don't know what to type at the min ute
12Most doctors are nonbelievers, and just don'
12t care.
10And kinda mean.
I've had 1 hours sleep in two days
02Lol, sometimes it's good to get it off your chest though X3
12No.
Apparently no one's grasping what I'm saying, so I'll shut up now.
12I am called to be a musician, and that's what i wil be.
6well, if I believe strongly in something, or not in something, I fight lol
6Suicune. Is. Not. Kirin.
/me 6flees
Hmm
legendary beast
10Very true. And as long you're not an open invite to any and all trolls then it helps.
13Not with that attitude
02I saw one rant about that Japanese talking on another site. You should have seen this one person's post, she was ranting the ranters on it.
speaking of Chuck Norris...
/me runs
10lol
10LOAFA LOL
6XD
yes?
02LOL
10And i just read Japanese person and ranting, then i raged shiny. Sorry :U
It's just easier if someone asks me something directly, not when everyone's just spitting out arguments and you can't tell who's replying to who.
13Yes with a question mark?
02That's fine :P
10XD
let it load
02Opinions are opinions XD
02I don't do that "desu" or "OMG kawaii!" or anythin like that, my friend does though :/
10>:( ahem i mean ...
10no i mean >:(
...
10Meh, as long as you know where it fits be my guest ...
13oh
Yeah it is, if you mean Jewish as in Hebrew, the race.
13kay
That's how I always viewed it.
12
o-O Lol
6I despise when people do that >:|
13Wow.
12What?
13Just wow.
10What, >:( or the "Kawaii desu" thing?
12I'm writing out a song.

Deshou.
>_>
<_<
02Lol XD
thats so kawaiii b*^______^*;;b
12lolz
His views are close to mine, but he obviously wasn't really educated/aligned with me enough to answer them right...
What's the b? o_O
And you're welcome, lol.
LOL! I have an 60 second auto-ignore on 'kawaii', and 'desu'. I was wondering what all the beeping what about.
o_O
10or a backwards d
Oh I see it
okay then o_O
10i don't care about desu because of OBVIOUS REASONS, neither kawaii.
So... bored...
02My friend kept calling me "baka" I was like Ovo?
I don't see why people get annoyed about people using them. But equally I don't know anybody who uses them.
9Same.
02(I know what it means, I was just wondering why she was calling me that)
13Magika: tis fun
I was hoping on going on another late-night excursion, but nuuu.
6yup
6ok, "baka" is actually ok in my book
02Stupid, idiot, etc
6"idiot"
6and it sounds hilarious if you say it XD
hop
10ok, brb counter-flaming some waptard who called me taht.
6LOOOOOOOOOOOL
It doesn't "annoy" me, I just think it sounds stupid, like someone saying "That was like, tres cool" It just sounds soooooo stupid, LOL.
02LOL!!
6there are some words that just don't work
10waptard is the few people REALLY overdoing it tho
6and there are some that do
13only if you're by yourself and with no one you know
13I was on for a few hours the other day with a friend
LOL
10What annoys me is the fact it looks stupid and the fact they think it makes their chance of becoming a anime-san any bigger.
:P
10and i got to burn my hands after writing that
13You can do blurs and stuff when you become a "regular"
13I like how you can draw with others at the same time
feed me
10and i hope it was gramatically incorrect etc
13and it has layers to draw on too which makes it easier
i want fish
6LOL
07we all want things
XD
6I never use baka in a sentence
Like just there
07liar!
6in my mind, it's more of a one-word exclamation XD

The voices never leave, and they got dreadfully boring after a while.
And satirical, strangely.

About the voices or the satire?

12wb Roara(late)
6I think I realized the problem
6I'm on IE O___o
/me pursues Roara "GROWL"
12time to go~
IE fails
12byes~
13mmkay
6I'm gonna see if I can get chrome on here
13damn
07chrome.
Independence dying slowly.
07CHROME.
6yes chrome
07CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOME.
/me coughs
Firefox
6I'd use firefox, but I'm gonna try chrome first
/me has failed!
13what's wrong with your connection lol
Market prices rising fast.
Firefox wins... most of the time (over IE, nt sure bout chrome)
6a good friend of mine uses chrome and told me to try it, so I said what the hey, I'll try it
I don;t fucking know.
6he likes in better than firefox lol
07CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME.
13wow
13need some midol
?
6it took you over a minute to type that out Kyu? XD
07no
6and what's wrong with chrome?
07CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME.
6lol
O:
13God is that just a joke from my family only? O_o
What's midol?
07CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME.
13some thing for when chicks have their periods
02...
lol
13as you always ask me if I need a tampon
13:|
Oh.
Even I knew that.
Lol.
6Kyu, mind telling me why NOT to get chrome?
6besides the fact that firefox has a better mascot?
02because chrome fails
/me 6flees
02google made it D:
6howso?
02a search engine
6lol google's been pretty good up til now
07google's only good for googling
Chrome is one of the best browsers out there in fact
6why is it bad though?
6THANK YOU
6but no one's told be the bad sides
I act like I have my period all the time.
it's lightweight, it's incredible fast, it's easy to use
02it has no addons like a video downloader like firefox does
13You're not the only one
do I need such an AddOn?
02i do
for browsing the web or doing online banking? NO!
PMS vicims unite!
6lol I don't XD
*victims
I recall going into the men's bathroom and putting in a lot of kool-aid so it looked like I, um, had menstruated in there.
don't get minefield (64 bit firefox) if you are running a 64 it comp, hardly any plugins for it D:
Nic!
*Nice
*64 bit
Lolz.
/me just failed right there.
/me is drawing a failspyro
oh and something more: The whole AddOn-system of Firefox is proven to be prone to install malware...
*truthful
07anything you download can install malware if you're careless enough
/me nods
13Well ABACUS
Oh my God, this is the perfect desk to headdesk
yeah, but not everything I install has direct access to my bank account data
02here's a solution
02don't do online banking ;P
13what's that
A group of people who consistently fail.
I was born in their headquarters.
13I'm the leader of that group
Lies, it is none other than Egan.
07i'd much rather wait a couple more years for a better version of chrome anyways
07the first ones are never perfect
The very thought of the thought of my concept inspires the group!
07I didn't even try FF until 1.5, I think
agreed Umbreon
6that's true
I keep online shopping to a minimum and banking for me is a no no
02regardless of how secure your computer is
02online banking and online shopping is just you begging to say "identify theft me"
07if i'd ever do online banking, i'd never use it for regular browsing either lol
07one computer for banking, one for everything else lol
02i'd agree with kyu on that one
13there boats aint made for the ocean
13you puttem in they not gonna make it

13I figured
12But someone DID get disqualified XD
06It's playing ATM.
06:D
12But I got them back in XD
who?
7Seasons of Love is playing ATM.
Everything in the whole house shut down for about a second.
Weird.
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTgqYwL1Wu0
13she isn't funny at all
13what is she a daycare teacher
9Mmhmm
9"I'm gonna die- I paid for that?"
Hello, again.
13XDD
9Hi Mr. President.
Hello to you, Secretary.
9Did you change?
...
Lol.
Funny as how I just came out of a shower.
13...LOL
9XD
13that's not mine
13:P
9Oh....*shotshotshot*
Teehee.
9I thought it was a birthday vid for LilyPad157
13no..
13xD
9*shot*
LilyPad?
13you know what really bugs me about Nikki
9What
Her completely misplaced sense of keen optimism?
13is that sometimes if I reply to a message of hers and she doesn't read it til months later, she says "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
13THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
9Welll you should type louder!
LOL
Wait, what video?
Hm.
13When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the feeling that I'M STANDING ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN!!!
I haven't made a video since last year, and I deleted it.
13wtf?
13O_O
Somebody's messing...
13I didn't do that...O__o
9Damn, you caught me.
I know.
But anyway..
What video did I post?
13No one said YOU did lol
Is that so?
Or were you telling me LilyPad was?
My bad.
13You asked who Lilypad was
13yeah
It seemed like you were titling me.
13XDDDD
Hawhaw.
Be back in a minute.
Wow.
That advert is kind of sad.
13what advert
Internet dating advert: "2% of all newleds said they met on <insert name of the dating site here>.com"
13LOL
I can't remember what the name of the site was.
2% of all in the world would be REALLY sad.
:P
Oh, I remember.
"eharmony.com"
13XDDDDD
13I do too
13I remember that old man used to be on ALL of them
13>:|
We get them now.
Ah, sorry about that.
"It worked in the US, so now we have <insert something about UK here>"
Muahahahahaha.
13HAVE YOU EVER HAD TIME IN A BOTTLE???
I mostly just laugh at the fake people on it.
13GET THIS MEDICATION 2DAY
They're terrible actors, since we all know they're paid to say stuff.
13I think a long time ago I saw on google that grilledcheez was on there
Not the same one, I'm sure.
My sister's friend (and her friends) found one of their teachers on an internet dating site, then set up an account, arranged to meet with him, then went there, and watched him wait for the other person.
I think that's kind of harsh though.
13THE ONLY COLOR THAT REALLY MATTERS IS GREEN
My uncle got married from one of those sites.
After like a few months.
Ah, one of the 2%.
Haha, yup.
13Who are you.
Ozma
Didn't you hear? It's Ozma!
Oh wait, the 2% is only specificly people that got married who met on that site. O_o So more in total will have used internet dating sites.
That occured to me like a minute ago.
Hmm, 5% would be pretty sad.
9Anyone have a eharmony account? I'm dad2bee
13...LOL
I'm loveMEpl0x097
LOL
We should go on eharmony to talk about it.
Should make an age 20 account, and say "Seeking 60+"
13LOL
9Or maybe have a long walk on the beach.
13I think that that match.com is just as silly
9dari: Winin.
13LOL
On the cyber beach of ...
*drum roll*
13HAWAII
13:P
/me observes as the drum roll drowns out whatever they said next.
Ozma.
Ozma.

Could I ask you to forcefully slam my face to the wall?
Yeah
Well
13LOL

9You're a bad person Ozma.

Hawhaw.
Let's all point and laugh!
13UR A PHONY
No, laugh and point.
"Ultimate Punch *kicks*" -Hot Rod
/me punches O-o
Hey, how long is a baseball game usually?
depends
can be anywhere from 2 to 6 hours
It's as long as a piece of string.
I know somebody whose status ever day consists of ": ) â™¥"
*every
I don't really care
baseball sucks
The occupants of my home are at a game
That's why I asked
Oh, I killed her.
13I hate sports..
Oh, cool.
sports pawn
baseball is just boring
My dad and Adult don't even like baseball
A neighbordhood-terrorizing crotch rocket really does the trick.
13then why are they at a game
/me sigh
UR BAK
I go to stuff I don't like all the time.
Better than staying at home.
Why is this place so active when nowhere else is? O_o;
SC isn't always active, though.
*shrug*
this place use to be active as hell
13I'd rather be at home than something boring as hell
this is nothing compared to it several months ago
Well, usually it can't be that bad.
9I'd rather be at something boring than at home
I'd just sell the tickets, loll.
depends on how active the forum is to a degree
13then why didn't you go
An unpopular element of the period table reminds you of a song?
Of course! The thingy!
13what happened
9"Stay the fuck away from me and [little sister]"
13...
13wtf
9My dad said that
13wow
13do you know why?
.__.'
Good times.
9Because I'm as crazy as mommy
13I don't think you're crazy
I do.
8,11Does this blind you yet!?
... Kidding.
13Ozma: no
x_x;
Ozma: No, it's quite easy-going on the eyes.
9Yeah well he does
13what exactly did you do though
I find the best way to shut my mum up is just to agree with her, she likes that.
9Apparently it's extremely obvious
Ugh, parents.
13I feel sad now
9Don't
My dad just stays away from me mostly.
Yeah, my dad gave me up as a lost case a loooooooooong time ago.
My mother's a druggy ;/
Gambler too v__v;
My mom's an alien.
9I'm not getting started.
Lol.
9Isn't he full?
Yes.
I'm not sure what species she is though.
My mom is a bitch
my dad is a realist
it's entertaining
And when he doesn't stay away, he criticizes me for not having the need-to-belong gene.
RDX: It sounds like it
Hm, my mum told me about a pretty screwed up film a while ago.
13My dad's an alcoholic and my mom works too much
Called Sophie's Choice.
my mom is also a workaholic
9My mom is a woman and my dad is a man.
Which includes, but is not exclusive to a woman having to choose which one of her children dies.
Like I said, my mom is an alien!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie's_Choice_(film)
Your mom's a man D:
9Apparently one reason why we didn't move yet is becauuse I'd have some kind of emotion breakdown
And dad's jealous
Seriously? Interesting how they'd be so considerate. :P
9What?
Never mind.
Sometimes I don't make sense.
13makes sense to me
9I'd either be too happy there, or negative as usual...
No one in their right mind could always be positive on this planet.
Or their left mind.
9I know.
Oh, how the turntables have... turned?
9They better fucking turn.
13huh?
/me always has the weirdest tendency to laugh when people are mad.
13if they are turning they're turning awfully slow
Which usually makes them madder.
Which means I laugh more.
Which usually makes them madder.
In which case I laugh morre.
And around and around
Lol
13we get it
9In which case you get prego and I punch your baby
... o-o;
13me too
Another funny word people day: "Preggers."
13can I punch it while it's still in the uterus?
*say
Yeah.
13How about you kick it
13I punched them before you
I suspect that would be lust of the eyes.
13:P
I think it's when two people make eye-contact and hold it, or something.
13okay
"When you establish eye contact with an opposite sex hotie in a bar or party for a long enough period of time that you know you might not come back home alone at the end of the night."
A punch from shulk to a baby? Nasty.
Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks this sounds insanely creepy: "i love you girls. i really love you. i wish i could hang out with you right this second and squeeze your cheeks and your buns. i would give anything (1 leg, 1 arm, and 1 eye) to come see you right now."
13weirdddd
13lmfao
"	
eye contact that withstands a time period longer than the casual encounter. eye contact that signifies: come hither.
"
Happy? :P
13DDDD
Someone wrote it on Facebook today.
9And did they mean it to be creepy?
I don't think so.
But they weren't related to the people either.
9...
13nlarnlargl

06Just because it's hard to FIND the last two.
06D:<
12I caught a tarantula :3
Bees are easy to catch

AWESOME J-ROCK WITH MIKU IS AWESOME
I love j-rock so much more than j-pop.
I have yet to hear j-rock
heard some j-pop
Why are you still alive?
And not in eternal agony?
Just kidding. J-rock is okay.
Not my fav, but it works well with vocaloids.
Hmm
because, I thought the j-pop I heard was pretty good. couldn't understand it, but it was good
Considering the Black Mages is my favourite band.
Then yes, I do prefer j-rock

Thanks~
but honestly, your keyboard seems to be broken
mine? o.O
yeah
no, i'm just busy
and why do you say that?
because you seem not to be able to type me name correctly
oh!
/me squints
07lol
the S is capitailized
sorry
didn't know, honestly
and i'm sorry if that p-ed you off
as long as you notice it being a mistake - it's okay
alright
nope
it's
easy on me
easy on you
/me sits down and starts drawing
and looks a hell of a lot beter in my mind
Out of curiosity
Why is it that important that your S is capitalized?
Oo
I'
ve always wondered
Hi
Im not here for long
aww D=
because that's what makes the difference between a very nasty copycat out on the net
I feel rather crappy :> No thanks to a certain falconbird who illustrates pretty well how little logic he has.
Ah, I see
why don't ya have a differnet name then, TS?
if it's a problem
yes?
Namechanging is difficult
You get attached to names
/me sighes
i know
:>
i'm attached to mine
then
07and changing because of a copycat just means that they won
I can't do that
because this nick is ME
ok, ok jeez
Hai pplz again~
and as you saw: TS is a very common short of my nick

Hello is anyone on?
/me 7is
I was woundering would Ninetails be a very popular pokemon in terms of people liking it?
I remember reading this funny chinise book on legends and a girl who was in real life a fox took on the form of a human
The name of the story was Lady Ren
Are you Auroua from the fourms?
7Ah, that's J.
xD
I noiced this odd thing about Ninetails was that unlike most of the early pokemon a lot of people still remember her
7And not Articuno? :P
07Hi sorry
07somewhat AFK
Articuno is very well known and has shown up in several shows while I don't think Ninetails really showed up in any of them
7I remember a few episodes with Ninetales.
I think Ninetails never really showed up as a main character?
7I remember in an episode or two.
Quan?
The only one I remember iswhen a Ninetales thought Brock was her old Master
I think Ninetails showed up in the pokemon the first moive
7http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=78.msg146101#msg146101 <-- That. O_o
And she lived in an illusion of a manion
what about it Quan?
They had a eposide with a Ninetails that played a trick on Brock I might have seen that or the last few minutes of it?
7It's a freakish dream, Aero. XD
oh
okay
I had a strange tream once were all the members of TST were their pokemon and anthro from and I was in Las Vegus with them as the only human there
/me is back
wb
7Really, Aero: me as Marly, glomps, and in space with the Mythbusters? O_o
umm
1 sec gotta erad it
*read
really busy Quan
7lolyoudidn'treaditXD
if you want we can PM
What was funny about the anthros in Las Vegus was I thought that I was going to check out what a Fur meet was and I didn't know that they were real
I might respond to you better in one
7Mmm'k.
Hulo
+l
Hi ya
Hey
7LAG.
02it's back up
Okay
Strangely I think that was based off the legendery story Lady Ren
Lady Ren is about this funny guy who runs into Lady Ren and he goes to her house and then wakes up in the middle of no were
Makes sense.
Strangely he's not mad at her and runs into her a week later and tells her that she is really a fox a
This short story would have made a great movie
Is there a moral?
When he tells her she's a fox she tells him that she wouldn't do anything to him that other foxes would do and some how ends up marring her
/me yawns
I really don't know what the moral of it is?
So what's the lesson of thecstory?
-c
The lession would be try to get to know as much as you can about someone?
And how is that portrayed inthe story? :3
When the guy marries Lady Ren aparterntly it was she was is soul mate becouse they seemed very happy with one another
Interesting.
I think I found the book it came in it was called Legends and Lore in Old China I think I might get a copy of it soon
Fantastic.
Wait...
ninetails*
7Lots of things from Japan are borrowed from the Chinese.
Really?
7Just take a look at its language!
I... guess... XP
They are creatures such as Ninetails are in Japan and Lady Ren would be one of them too
In it she made refence to the others of her kind who play tricks on humans
But China's been closed off for such a long time, I didn't think their myths and legends could spread'
Seems I was wrong
It must have been there for thousands of years becouse I think Japan went into Isolism from the early 1500's to 1853
So the legends of mistcal Foxes could be a very old ten thousand year old legend

7Gerple: that's a silly reason to hate someone. I apologise if I did for that reason alone.
6Agreed*
06Do you have a YouTube account, Slash?
06SKY.
7RDX: Hell yeah. The world is boring without conflict. Without annoying people there is no conflict.
06Get in a search room. :D
GAH

I facepalmed my sunburn
06Kk Cynder
7Haha.
7Nice one.

06What's your username?
06@Slash
6Peh.. You had another reasen though...
7Her being a noob is just added annoyance.
6My grammar.. was dramatic...(It still is though)
7Besides, you're not a noob now.
XD
10DING
06Cool, I'll add you when I have time. :3

what about charlie lol
I unlike 80% of most chatrooms actually have something called common sense
7"Our BEES will blot out the SUN." "Then we will HUG in the shade."
7RDX, you are not a chatroom.
7You have fialed.
7You have no common sense.
06Yooyu is so cute. <3
6"This is delicious!" "This Is Caketown!!"
why because you enjoy conflicting vocabulary words?
7Yes.
7Bwahaha
7*shot*
as far as I'm concerned it's a room where people are chatting :P
so it works for me
7I do.

9I was wondering that
who knows
10hur wuz heer earlier
9Though she was probably scared off by Adult
10she had to do meps
she could be doing a wide variety of things
10she had to do meps
9Btw, was she annoying?
7Probably abusing her powers somewhere else.
7How can no-one in my house smell that smoke?
lol
9She keeps on telling me to ask
10So please shut your mouth. (:
lmso
10imso?
10o-o
6Lol
didn't you know that?
10Holy s****
I send him weed every month
7No. The smell's been coming and going (whatshesaidblamf) all frigging day.
10He is 13?
no he's actually 22

10Thought so.
10;\
10;/
6lol
10What does she do wrong?
9What do you mean?
10-_-
10;\
10She does her job.
10xDDD
10^ win
no shit
I worked 10 hours today
did you?
10No he sat his lazy butt at home. :3
7Does slaughtering babies and feasting on their blood count?
sure
I'll take it
10He makes everyone else do it.
that makes you 90% more useful then most of society anyways :P
7Abuses her power routinely. Anyone who disagrees with her even in minor things gets kicked or banned. She's banned me several times just for starting a conversation with her, which she then devolved into an argument, and I remember the time she was gone for two hours and then came back all pissed off because we were talking about her. And I believe we were
thanks
7discussing how much cheese sounds rediculous in concept.
STRAWBERRIES.
7There was the time she got pissed off because dari said homosapien.

My mom got strawberries =3
9She doesn't do the former
this album makes me think of an amsuing quote from that Frost vs. Nixon film
"Vienna - it's like Paris minus French people"
or something to that effect
7and she routinely likes to flaunt the fact that she's so socially incompetent and incabable of fighting anyone beyond the screen she doesn't have to go to school, and then fosters the misunderstanding that she doesn't do any schoolwork at all.
She has done those things
9No, but she isn't like that.
brb
7Gerple: As I state routinely. N00b =/= newbie. I do not kill harmless newbies.
doesn't matter if that isn't how she's like
06Sky? Ovo
she can't control her emotions
9I can see her getting pissed at 'homo sapien', though
that pretty much voids it
6Peh... I was harmless back then too..
7Homosapien means human.
06Read #Neopets, Cynder
9I know that.
Okay am I the first one to notice this but are there a load of sick names in captian pugwash or whatever
7then she went "I know, but i know what u ment by HOMO DARI!!!!!!11111APPLE"
Seaman Stanes
6MSN RPing ftw X}
9She doesn't talk like that
9She laughs at people who type like that
6Magi? Then she laughs at herself? ;o
it's a cartoon show you nitwit
6Brb! I have to switch pc's T.T
7Now answer the point, not how I typed it.
6So.. Bai!
oi
9Well yeah, I know her vocabulary isn't big
7She knew what it meant.
7Yet she still kicked dari.
7Why? Because she likes to abuse her power.
9On her YouTube stream, she doesn't kick people
7I can honestly understand why she does it, if anything she's told us about her life is true. But the reason is still no excuse.
9Well I don't see why she wouldn't abuse it all
9If she did
7Neither do I. But regardless, she abuses her power here. She can't keep her emotions in check, and any time anyone confronts her about it, she flaunts /being_bullied/ like a shield, as if no-one else in the world had been bullied, and then kick/bans them if they're below her in power.
9She doesn't use being bullied as an excuse
7Oh yes she does.
7She tells everyone about it, and then implies that it's her excuse whenever anyone confronts her.
9Well on other sites she doesn't.
other sites are not the point
7well other sites is NOT THE POINT.
7HERE is the point.
9She gets angry as hell on othersites, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse.
9*other sites
7Other sites are NOT THE POINT. That's three times.
7She probably does it HERE, because HERE she can GET AWAY WITH IT. Me and RDX have had lengthy discussion about how bad an admin SR is. We're on the backburner. It would take the clamouring of the entire site for him to flippantly consider it.
9Fine, I get it. The Spyro site logo brings back memories of suffering for her.
7where the hell did that come from?
9Sorry.
7Oh no. I'd like to hear that story.
7And the explanation as to why she doesn't leave spyro alone if it brings back memories of suffering.
wtf
9Sardonic joke.
7I see.
GUEST
7Any other points, or are we willing to admit defeat and allow me to move on to other things I have to do in the next hour and a half?
9I surrender.
7Thank you. I'm glad you did it graciously and allowed the three of us involved to retain our dignity.

Hello
Hey Rocket Ninetails
Hi
06Hi RN
I'm the same one as Ocean Railraoder
Yeah I know
I saw this book on legends from China and they had a intersting legend about a fox that was like Ninetails called Lady Ren
Ninetails was probably based on that legend
Tales, not tails, dammit
/me pulls on ninetales tail
wb DRF
It must have been a durma and a comedy becouse the Guy finds out she's a fox when he walks out side of her mansion and he's in the middle of nowere
02hi
03hi
/me ties helium balloons on the end of Umbreon's tail "Bye bye"
02...
Hey I don't think I've talked to you before on chat Umberm
Noooo, gerroff
Let me go get a lawn chair ballons and lawn chairs are fun
There was once a movie about a guy who built a flying lawn chair once
Yeah I think someone tried it out and fell or something, or maybe it's not true.
There was a roumor that someone did it in our area and it somehow worked he got a few miles
If anyone did try that, they'd want to make sure they were strapped in
I'd use the hillbilly seat belt duck tape The humor is if someone had the right ballon and a oxgen mask they could fly from Virginia Ireland on the jet stream at 250 miles on hour
Now that would be some facelift
Hi Altair
Hey Altair
10Hey all
06Hai Altair
10Hiya~
LOL got the football/soccer song in my head again, can't show the vid because it contains swearing but they sing 'What a waste of council tax! We paid for your hats, we paid for your hats!" at the police, it's hilarious
I'm making a spoof of the recession myself called Bear Market Bull vs Bear too
02i suspected arti
02that link was a rickroll after all
02next time figure out how to disable journal comments :P
I knew it was a trap or something when I read though everyone elses comments and didn't play it
>:O
O:< upset angel
06xD
XD
10hi
I'm here but not for long.
hi RN
Ok
12I'm really tired, I think I am heading to bed soon
03Hi Articuno
03you got the webcam alright?
12Hey DRF
12Yes
12It's broadcasting live now
03Cool
03LOL
03broadcasting to who?
12But not my face lol
12To anyone, it's a URL
03XD
03so I can stare at a wall all day?
03That's usefl.
12It's on my DA
03*useful
03But if you're throwing any wild parties, let me know
/me runs
12Lol it's on my hands typing right now
03XD
03So, my laptop is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow
03That has a built in webcam
03when that arrives, you wanna talk sometime? XD
12Yeeeep
03I would use my desktop but this thing is getting slower by the day... and it probably will fail
03I might reformat it once I move all my important stuff to the laptop
03it's gonna be an awesome state-of-the-art laptop too... 2.4GHz CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, and a 1GB GPU...
03I could probably watch several HD movies at once
04back
10o_O
12This is really annoying, the webcam stream isn't working for my mum
10I've had one state-of-the-art laptop once
03LOL
03your mom has a webcam>?
10After two years it sounded like a hair dryer when on
12No ..
12She's watching the live stream of mine...
03LOL, you know what you should do
03call her on the phone
03put her on speaker
03and then just have her watch your stream
03so it's like a one-way video and one-way talk
12Yeh but it's not working.
03LOL
03Fail'
12She said it just sits there.
12Like a picture
I'm back for more insulator hunting mayhem
04brb
Hey Articuno
12Hi
12I am going to head to bed now I think
03OK
12I might get on my DS before I fall asleep
03LOL
10ok, cya Arti
03Did you hear I lost my DS Lite?
03:<
03I'm gonna go buy a new one soon though
12WOW fail
12How?
03I had it at camp
03and I left it on a table
03we were all in the room
02hmm
04back
03well all I know is parents came and went, and when they all left it was gone
03someone sneakishly stole it most likely
03It's not so much the DS I'm mad about, but the Supercard
03That thing had ALL MY SAVES
03ALL OF THJEM
03-J
03My real Platinum cart has an older save, from before when I got a Munchlax :/
If someone stole my favorite memory stick I would go after them
12Ooooh my god >v<
10sucks :/
12Anyway going to use my DS brb
To make a minute of monster movie takes about 40 to 90 picture slides
hi Altair
Most likely what would happen to me would be the cheap plasic thing world break or slide into the depths of my sofa into a paralie world
My memory stick
03I lost a Micro SD that way
03it fell into my couch
03I had to unstaple it and almost tear it apart to get it back
What makes it funny more me is I have one of those double folding ones to were I have to flip and sacke the thing and worry about getting my hand cut off when I go for something down there
wb?
Going to bed now, see you all
nds browser is the stupidest thing ever, you can't use a rom without buying it basically
night rn!
Good Night Rocket Ninetails
Articuno when I make a monster moive it takes about 40 to 80 picture slides to make a scene with characters to move around on the memory stick
ovO
Arti, I'm curious, how do you work your DS to get here?
I assume you have a DSi?
no
I'm planning to flim a expesive scne in this Bear Market vs Bull movie that is going to show flooding which will take 200 slides to show sections of a city flood when the two monsters crash into the ocean
using a cartridge called r4 which takes a mcro sd card
R4, I see
you put roms on the micro sd and it reads them
I get it now, thanks
^^
Hm, I wonder if it's possible to connect to site chat at least on the DSi there is a browser
Wii even
yes it is
One of the best things ever invented was the Trillobit stick that is a god send more movie makers
04bye everyone
bye
i have a browser on here but it crashes my ds on certain pages
/me pokes Chibi Ulquii :D
/me turns into a Chibi D=
It's a cartridge right, the browser?
10Arti, the default DSi browser or a homebrew?
See you later Vaporeon SS
03Altair, there's also the "DS Web Browser"
10Opera one?
im not on a dsi
its ds organise browser
/me has Valentine's Day stuck in her head D=
the opera one sucks, you need expansion for it :/
10I hate that one
10yeha
10*ah
06I used to be my own protection, but not now~ 'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow~
That's the browser the Wii uses
i have it and it won't run of course
I don't like rice

Anyone ever try grits

Im afraid to look up the real lyrics

/me flees
going in 3 mins or so
k!
i think i am too XD
I mean it might ruin it LOL
right now this is just hilarious
Here is some of my work of show people getting eatten like pop corn shrimp by a giant black bear http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HF2WQPRzzA&feature=channel_page
oh really random but today i learned that if you buy fish and chips right near a beach, there will be grains of sand in it...
10o-o
That's not right..
Did they pick it up at the beach dump or something
the sand gets blown in
Ah, nvm I understand
I was about to say
i didnt believe it when xai warned me!
03LOL
then i went CRUNCH
The fish places in Virginia beach called fish and fin are owned the Norfolk sanation department
03but eh, when did you get a flash cart?
DRF
03what
The same the clowns who take the tash out
NDS BROSWER IS STUPID
whew - they show the train cameras on regional TV again
03XD
2lol
03But if you're using DSOrganize, you're using a flash cart
03WHEN DID YOU GET ONE?
I bought a flash card about six weeks ago
i got it lst month from xai's mum
03LOL
03Like Supercard, AceKard, what
R4
03EW
03R4 sucks
03slot 1 or slot 2?
1 is ds right?
03Yeah
1 then
03XD
and why sucks?
03but seriously, you should get a Supercard DSi-One
03well, it has like NO extra features
10Acekard is win.
03and there are no upgrades for it
no this works fine
03so basically
03any new game
http://koeln.center.tv/cms/
03you can't use on the R4
take a look at the program currently running :)
03Supercard has updates, AceKard for some reason just runs everything LOL
um
We have this one show called The Smoking Gun World's Dumbest
that's one of our interurban trains running from bonn to cologne
Could you link me up to it?
what the hell do you need to update to run an nds file?
supercenter I have a Diamond flash card system
I just did
03basically, a lot of new DS games have new anti-flash card protection
03R4 won't play them
03Supercard will after updating, and the AceKard will too
ahh
03so the R4 is outdated
03and also it lacks things like savestate and built-in Action Replay
well i only use it for irc you know\
03The only reason the AceKard is as good as the Supercard is it's way faster, and runs almost anything you throw at it without needing to update
03XD
03You should get a Supercard though, they're like $20 now
03AceKard 2i is like $12, lul
i dont need it
03XD
03Pirated games FTW though
r4 is fine for me
nah
This Diamond System I bought was 80 bucks
i just want irc
03LOL
03But don't you plan on playing ROMs?
i gotta go now
03btw, try getting ClIRC
Time Shift some of the trains look like this marklin train I have at home
no not much
03It works a bit better than DSOrganize
i have it
03I used to use DSO, but someone told me about the other
03XD
See you Arti, continue the conversation tomorrow?
its what i use :>
03Oh
03LOL
oh?
ok cp
night all'
well, Marklin is a german company, so :P
I bought it becouse I wanted to have over head catenray on my train set
http://www.groneck.de/Fotos/bn.jpg
that's one of the interurban trains running here
03well bbl
partly on rails like you see on the TV stream atm, partly going underground
the screenshot shows one of the trains stopping at the United Nations square in Bonn
05hi
hi Guest
The train I have on the train set looks more like the trains Articuno posts Xai driving
the fun thing whilst looking at the stream: You can see a bit of typical german villages and surroundings ;)
05im not a guest
05im ...
ahh
02hiiii
good thanks. What about you?
03Now I've gone and done it. D<

02back
06Wb
Time Shift do the German raywails still have old telegraph poles in bushes by the railroad tracks
05sketching... drool
The catenary masts are the ones that carried the eletric power while the telegraph poles were around before the catenary wires were built
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ldlMxFfqI
/me dies
err...I'm not entirely sure
hi
some old and smaller tracks do have those I believe
http://www.insulators.info/pictures/?id=148746479
OH!
no, you only find those in very small communities and villages, but VERY rarely here
/me listens to Lugia's song while sketching it~
I found another photo on insulators.info about what they comomly looking up close http://www.insulators.info/pictures/?id=97952486
03No Cynder D<
I have a collection of 2300 US glass insulators at home
06Yes, Twii.

whew, those look really, really old^^
06No.
/me flees
06Lugia's song is way better. <3
03Do you know what that link is? XDD
when you get to come to germany, you'll have quite fun in the many scales of trains going around here
03Ooh~
03I dare someone to watch that link >DDD
I remeber hearing the Marklin made a G scale train and does Germany have narrow gauge railroads still around?
See you later Skylands
it starts with the usual trams, the interurban light trains, diesel or electric powered regional trains, city "S"-trains, city-express "SE"-trains, intercity trains, interregio trains and intercity express trains
02Sky! ;v;
Hello?
/me freakin' loves Bubbles' transformation X-x
My Father rode around on the train system when he visted there in the 1970's
narrow gauge? Only rarely and in village use in fact
Hmm ...
So it is manly used for streetcars?
What?
what?
not even streetcars. they also use standard gauge
Richmond Vriginia used to have a vast Streetcar system but they ripped it all up in 1949

!lag
yeah
oh and speaking of exotic and rare things, take a look at this: http://www.innotron.de/photogallery/galerie02/Dot-Matrix-Frontanzeige%20Obus%20Solingen_gr.jpg
what's odd with this bus, eh?
05hi Altair
!lag
10Hey
05ha ha kyu i just saw it now
That is very good the danger to trains around here everything is around the car
03slhgsoidhgdf
10what's wrong
03*D<
10with it? o-O
o_O
take a closer look at it
03THE JAPANESE VERSION IS SO WAY BETTER D<
05Twilight :D
The thing it says at the top? o_O;
05ah i like the original Powerpuffs anyways
Hey, there's nobody in it. o_O
that's a pantograph! :)
There is one place in Virginia were the streetcars are reclaming their old routes and that is in Norfolk and Virgina Beach http://www.ridethetide.com/
03BLOSSOM HAS A YO-YO :DDDDD
03LOL BUTTERCUP IS SO RIGHT ABOUT SKIRTS >D
one of the rare things in Solingen, Germany. They don't have trams or such, but still had the electric wires from the old trains. They didn't want to remove all the wires, still needed an economic passenger-transfer system
therefor the pantograph-buses were developed
they're going 100% electric
05lol Twilight
06...
05o yeah was it ok that your character was wearing shorts? you didnt comment so...
They used to have them in Pettersburg Virginia the trackless trolleys
and something even more exotic: http://lh4.ggpht.com/_CTLjqd1SqGg/SRatX29WaAI/AAAAAAAAArg/WeFTKgOIK9w/DSC_1056.JPG
7Yeah Arti made that Cynder
The link didn't pop up
06Then why's it have Becky Cerro's copyright on it? D:<
03O-o
05ah that reminds me.... someone took my art a while ago too
06That better be Arti's username on whatever site that is or something. XD
03Buttercup's voice sounds strange XD
06Ah.
/me figured
06X3
It said google error
05Twilight???
06I was gonna guess real name after username. XD
/me plays Lugia's Song again
well, another picture: http://www.fes-muenchen.de/rund/fruehlin.01/wuppschw.jpg
05was it ok that you had shorts?
03Ya
05k thanks Twilight
it IS fun in fact^^
/me removes one O from Arti's last name! :O
06*R
06XD
/me coughs
that's the "Wuppertaler Schwebebahn", one of the oldest trains in germany in fact
06:D
that thing was built in 1898!
That looks very neat how it is over the river
05hey
05why do peole always pet me
05sigh
7That is old, interesting
06Because you're a pet.
06:D
It should be a very good shape as long as it's given care
/me pets the pet whom does not want to be pet, the silly little pet
/me is shot
yeah, but it was modernized several times, got new wagons and trains
/me reloads
/me shoots more
/me is shot more
Do they have any plans to expland the system?
/me kicks Kyu then flees
/me catches the kick
6does anyone know when kipikpo usually logs in?
05im a ...PET >.
10I don't
05i havent seen kipi for a looooooooooong time
/me sneezes flames into Kyu's face
Usely Kipki comes in around 9.00PM the times I see him
/me absorbs
6:/
07=3
7They probably would in time, rail
06Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. :D
lol Shiny
06I says you're a pet! :DD
05DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
02Eep! *flees*
/me pets Cynder
/me is pet
/me bites Kyu's paw
/me ties her to a leash and tangles it around a tree
/me runs around the tree :D
/me is yanked by the tree
06DAMNIT.
06D:<!
/me noms on Kyu's tail
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsvHKC6pCP4 >>best song EVER
06They ALWAYS do that.
06D=
that's one of the completely restored historical trains: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Wuppertal_kaiserwagen.jpg
It looks very good
it's called "The emperor's car" - because it's from the time germany still had an emperor
saying: from the 1900s and around
There are a few left over old trains in pockets all over Richmond many at the Science Musem of Virginia
we got PLENTY of historical train cars over here. Even several historical trams^^
/me flies around the tree
/me uses Flare Blitz on it! D:<
06BAD TREE.
/me has trains that go by her house ALL the time
one of those historical trams can even be hired for partys and corporate celebrations. You can get on, go through the city and celebrate aboard :)
/me goes back to drawin
06Same here, Shiny. :D
06Except you might not be drawing Lugia.
7Let me guess, it's insanely expensive?
06On Photoshop.
06XD
he's drawing Oliver, Cynder
02Yep ^.^
06Lawl.
06Olive? :D
06THE OTHER REINDEER?
02+r :3
/me is shot
no
06You suck, then.
06D:<
We have a abondoned canal that runs though Richmond that had a railroad built on the tow path called the James River and Kanwha Canal
the kitten from Oliver and Company

06KITTEH KITTEH KITTEH.

CUTE ^v^
05heh heh
/me pokes Oliver with Lugia's Song
/me hugles Oliver "MINE!"
http://www.rheinbahn.de/SiteCollectionImages/380_fliegend_belsenplatz.jpg
that's one of the "newer" historical party trams
02Hehe, tryin to draw him with all my might XD
There was something instering I found out about old railroad things in this show called Life After People
XD
7I watched that show, pretty interesting
The train as along as it's acitive will remian in good shape but if it stops and rusts it goes away
7Especially what happens in the animal kingdom
03I just realized something o-o
o_O
or seattle
w/e
03Buttercup talks too fast XD
/me will brb
kk
nope
06DONE.
06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/LugiaSketch.png
The trains in Germany were built in the 1900's and lived though and are in heathy shape in 2009 which means the've gained vaule like a house
that's good Cynder!
06:D
06Thanks.
/me high-wings, "good job!"
/me coughs
02Very nice
06My sketches are usually better than my actual art. XD
In Norfolk Viringia the streetcars lived from 1880 then died in 1949
/me notes the sarcasm in both of the compliments :3
/me is shot
Then in 2003 they spent 330 millon to rebuild only a eight mile line on a railroad that runs on a old streetcar bed
no, I actually think it's good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agtCkdY62os
with original in-train announcement
those announcements are always and automatically made prior whilst approaching a stop within the train
they tell you the next stop's name, your connections via other trains/buses and the direction you have to exit
/me is coughin from breathin problems =.=
I favorited it If the streetcar system would have lived none stop like in germany it most likely would have only cost the city 120 millon to take of the system and extend it to the surburbs
/me gives shiny a cough drop and some water
/me is making her left wing on Photoshop ATM X3
06Again, just a sketch.
yeah
most of the tunnels interconnect with existing tunnels - some are new
and that's the main problem: The work they need to do causes....quite....traffic problems
Are they using old fashion cut and cover tunneling?
the current project they're realizing in Düsseldorf is around 550 million euros
06=3
/me is done already
/me drinks the water, but the cough drop won't help
06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/ContradictionLeftWing.png << That be mah left wing.
05i cannot open the picture
02Want to see my failure with the mouse?
/me makes her right wing next :D
sure
XD
05ha ha remeber teh demxy i drew with the mouse lol
06XD
06XD
/me draws everything on the computer with a mouse D=
nah, I think it's easier to start from sketch
/me doesn't
the really hard thing here is: They have to build the new system WITHOUT taking the OLD one out of business in the meantime
02I usually draw and scan ;3
meaning: They have to detour the traffic and rework the normal tracks needed for trains to pass the working place around ten to twenty times until they're entirely done
05ha ah well Quan was there but it was for fun to see how much i could draw with the mouse in 30 minutes
Around in Virginia they are very sensetive about the Grandfather claus such as if it hasn't been around before and is something new they take everyone to court such as if the streetcar was there before they wouldn't compain about it
06Done with the right wing.
06:D
The people in Norfolk are screaming murder about them spending money return the streecar to it's native habait
06http://i424.photobucket.com/albums/pp327/deidara111_2008/ContradictionRightWing.png
06It's only slightly smaller than my left wing in real size, though. X3
What's funny is the streetcar follows a major Interstate Highway called 264 which is Virginia Beach's biggest parking lot
05yeah shiny
06Beach?
06Bleach?
06BLEACH?!
know what's really nasty? Some of the people have houses close to the airport and complain about the planes being too loud, the airport being too big...
06BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEACH.
06<3
10Good for cleaning white shirts
well, the airport's there since 1895 - being a former zeppelin airport
10o_O
it was modified to the airport like it is today in 1927 - and NONE of the people complaining today was even born in those days already...
those people bought their land close to the airport around 1950 to 1960, built houses on it...and complain about the airport being too loud...
02wb Aero
how sick is that, eh?
That is funny here you will get people who buy a 500,000 house which they know is next to a four lane wide freeway and compain when they want to widen it to ten lanes
same here
ty shiny
Another funny thing is about Wind farms they don't mind it when Virginia power puts in a mosnter coal plant but when somone wants to build a small wind farm they go ape
hi Ecco
I learned about the BIGGEST of ALL jokes at the university^^
people are quite unsure regarding radiation of mobile phone masts, you know?
several people tried to sue the mobile phone companies for potentially causing cancer
I kind of think they might do something to people they put them on apartement buildings in the poor nighboor hoods in Richmond
one of the mobile providers set up one of these masts in a small village here - and the inhabitants started to complain about having headaches...
so the spoke to the major and he SHOULD talk to the provider to take the mast out of order again
7FPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPT.
/me is late >_>
7I'm back.
wb Quan o_O
02Lol
7Guess what I found at the beach today? o3o
02Sand?
/me flees
A shell!
well, the provider invited the major and some of the inhabitants of the village to visit the mast
7YUSH.
A shark tooth? o-O;
oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK0y4xflj8 Hear is a funny rant about cell phones
Yay, I win! :D What does it look like?
02A...shell!
7Actually, I found a Horseshoe Crab. :P
02:P
original saying: "Well, wer weren't able to put the mast online as the most important tech was still missing. This thig wasn't even wired. It was just placed. But that's it."
the people complained due to a piece of metal standing somewhere - without ANY wires being put at it...
That is funny
06Nomnomnom.
06:D
that's not just funny, that's ridiculus and proves how retarded some people are
Another funny thing is about high voltage lines some clowns will buy a house right next to the power lines live there for 50 years and then when the power company comes to repair or install new ones they go banans
There was this one dude who tried to take the power company to court becouse the power lines would go though his favorte feild of hay
06HIGH VOLTAGE LINES?
/me pokes High Voltage
that's why there's a BAN-mile around each high voltage mast here
03Mojo Jojo scares me o-o
That is odd around here the builders try to put the new houses as close as possible to the bases of the towers
NOTHING may be built within fivehundred meters around ANY high voltage wire or mast - heavy industry being the only exception
That is a good rule it makes it safter if one of them falls over
07lol
07i'd think most states would have the sense to have that rule
few do here. They're strictly maintenanced. Especially since the last blackout after a severe snowfalls in 2007
7Brbzors.
05ZAP!!
02kkzorz
A lot of the poles around here are rotted out wooden high votlage ones form the 1950's on their last leg
03lksdholsidgd
There is a type of insulator hunting I thought of that helps keep the lights on
03How do you register a channel? -_-
07uh
I go around with a camra and drive around to crapy poles know are going to kick the bucket and and take photos of them and bring them to the power company
manly the low voltage ones that go to houses I take photos of and show to the power company
07I don't think the wooden poles are the same as the higher voltage metal ones
I had a freind who worked in power generation
07the metal ones are for longer distance power transfer
Around here we have giant wooden ones that are 90 feet tall for 115 and 230KV
07oh lol
07that doesn't sound safe at all
no wood over here
most of them here look like this: http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Magazine/emags/epublic/2006/044/Medien/hochspannungsmast,property=poster.jpg
/me sees the channel is still in one piece :)
That is a monster high voltage line
with smaller village variants like this: http://view.stern.de/de/picture/1236064/Sonne-hochspannung-Hochspannungsmast-Hochspannungsmasten-Hochspannungsleitung-Sonnenblitz-Schwarz-510x510.jpg

7Back!
Here is a some photos of what Virginia Power is starting to do to the wooden ones
03QUAN
03I HAS A QUESTION
That High voltage tower must be loaded with high voltage chain glass suspesons
03HOW DO YOU REGISTER A CHANNEL? >3<
/me pokes Twili
7Yes, Twilly?
7FRIGGLIN' LAG. D:
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Elbekreuzung2.jpg
that monster is 226 meters high! That's more than 740 feet!
I think the ones in Virginia would run away if they ran into that tower must at least have four major circuits running on it
/me is going to eat dinner see you guys later
7Brb
yeah, it has for major circuits - each one 380,000 volts
hello?
There is a circit they want to build though Virgina that runs at 765,000
?
They haven't build it yet or they may not
depends of what kind of wires they use
? wat are you talking about?
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Elbekreuzung2.jpg
this one here :P
The 765's carry six wires on each line
well, I'm not an expert on all of this. But I think it's quite interesting
It's good to think about these in that our website and world need things like this so it's good to talk about them
06holy crap! that is huge!
as I said: 226 meters / 740 feet
06excuse my languge
already excused
How many times a year do you lose power Time Shift?
err...I can't remember when we lost power the last time here
It's not uncommon to have our power go out for three or four days in a row
06i got mad on the shout box and left and i an babling on about nothing arent i?
hrm...I think I had a blackout...hrm...in 1996?
We once had a hurrcaine knock out our power for ten days in a row
but just for half an hour or so
06i was born in 96
well, THAT's why all our power lines are five times redundant :P
06ok i am confused
Our last power knock out was in Feb when several massive trees fell into our power lines from our nighboors our house went down to 31F
06:0
no problem here. As I said: Ban mile around the high voltage masts. Woods, trees and anything else included
06*holds head in confusin*
06i hungry....................
That is very good some of our power lines look in life after people
well, then go get a snack :P
See you later Time Shift and good night
06i dont know wat to eat...........
yeah, I'm also in bed now
06good night!

02Why? Why is this world so complicated? Why is everything so messed up? Is it all one big puzzle that we have to figure out?
02If so, then hat means we've just made it bigger and bigger
7I could answer that, NS, but it'd be breaking one of the chat rules.
02the more we discover, the better this world comes
02Yet, it also destroys part of it
your leture
02The integrity of it......
/me sighs
Lecture*
02Then can we talk elsewhere about it please?

02Hey Feather
02Can you dodge Dark Aura without getting hit?
10I dunno
10if you can it's really hard
02The trick is to go in a diamond shape
02and then jump on the 4th time he appears
02Of course, before
02And then go right off to the side
02He always misses that way, :P
02Try it, Feather, it helps
/me hates getting hit by Dark Aura, because it kills her...I only have 200 HP XD
2Feather, wanna iscrib?

That's... pretty weird to be honest

I was like "WTF" when they showed up as clones since I knew Slash =/= Quan
/me is NOT a clone
/me just uses mibbit too
I use mIRC
2i have mIRC on my laptop
2using mibbit here
I'm used to mIRC with NoNameScript, so I keep using it
I use mIRC without any scriptset
I found it hard to use that way
I find it much easier.
Personal preference
Well, it might be easier with some scriptset, but I dun care.
07the clonechecker isn't perfect
07and i'm thinking they're all on mibbit
07also

hey
what is better
blazekin or charizard
07both are pretty weak competitively
02indeed
grr
07i'd go with blaziken
02however blazekin laughs at skarmbliss
I like Charizard. Screw tiers.
02*blaziken
yeah
02indeed
ya
i have all 3
02i'm just saying between blaze and charizard
07no one denies that charizard is awesome lol
and septile
07I have one
02blaze is probably better
07I just never wins
07*it
02what moveset do you have kyu?
07i forget
im just gettin all mine traded to new game
lets
02lol
see
02i used to have a belly zard
07pretty sure it's special attacker though
02it's too hard to get out though
07I don't trust bellyzard
ya?
02is that according to shoddybattle
02stealth rock is the most commonly used move
02guess how badly stealth rock hurts charizard
i didnt plan on usin it
Oh, did I not change my nick? o_O;
bad?
4x if im correct?
07yup
02takes out half it's HP
i personally like blaze
07stealth rock takes off 1/2 of charizard's hp
02now
02think about how badly stealth rock beats shedinja
uh
-4x ?
02lol
2Hai :3
02let's say this
idk what shedinja is
02wonderguard doesn't stop stealth rock
wow
um fail
02it comes out once it dies
02actually kyu
02when we played our friendly tiny tournament here
2lol
02first round i faced someone with a shedinja
02he was bragging about his shedinja and brought it out after i took out his lead
02he freaks out when it dies to stealth rock
02"WHAT?!"
my lead should have stealth rock
02stealth rock is a massively good move
02takes away the use of focus sash
yeah
i just never used it in pearl
im putting a team together
02when did we start talking about little cup?

Do you really want to clean up the mess when we're done?
I think you should let me step outside.
2XD
seen such a thing with Dolphy and TaniDaReal's art before....
7Of course not. Housekeeping will do that. This room is soundproof, as is this department. And the building itself. None of the public can possibly know what's going on in a place that doesn't exist.
2X3
Sounds like we're in space.
7My my, they did do a number on your brain. No my friend. We are not in space. But we do not exist. We are anonymous
Well my mind gets a bit foggy at the part where I notice I have an extra limb, which is protruding from my back pocket in an uncomfortable manner.
7Sir, I think you are high. Now come with me.
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I know, right now you can't tell. Hmm... I rattling off again, aren't I? And Matchbox Twenty sucks. What's wrong with my braaaaaaaain?

7LAG
04Because you're only seeing 20% of each pic ovo
04because 20% times five pictures is 100% XD
/me <3 numbers
04What you do is you just use the select brush and copy and paste yourself into the main pic XD
oh

Brb while I go pretend to hug my Gabumon plushie.
XD
kk
idk wether to release the pokemon you sent or keep and train em... cause idk if there hacked or not
They're not hacked
I just duplicated the save file.
Do whatever. Doesn't matter. :p
2kjdlasfjkds
/me yawns
se tired
*so
i better go
02LOL
Basically, I can do whatever I want on any game, and it won't matter, because I backed-up the save file.

I got the idea from Animal Crossing.
It's my insurance against seeders and brickers.

Feather :)
10hi
did i see something somewhere where people could apply to be a gym leader
2Feather hi
That's what I said through the voice chat o.o
it seemed like i saw that somewhere
108D
what does it do?
2XD
the flash card
A variety of shaninigans
02lol
shananigans*
so are these pokemon haked or not
No
XP
They're not/
i should really release them...
lol
I don't have AR or any other hacking thing, and like I said earlier, do whatever you want with them.
can anyone breed me a turtwig
2nope
XD I just gave you one.
but it might be considered haked
cause its cheated
2???
2O_o'
It's not hacked
eh ok
2GUEST
Literally, all I did was copy, and paste.
2feeshbiscuit
2o3o
i hate my computer
2Why?
That's like saying I'm hacking this next sentence because instead of typing it out, I c/p'd it.
o.o
training this pokemon to level 100 sounds like alot of work lol
2O_o
meh true
Once I put a grass move on a fire type, why? Because I can. :o
Ponyta can learn Solar Beam
O_o
2o3o
2LOL
Freaky, I know.
2LOL, but that's cool
Someone in the Elite 4 has one like that.
It's cheap, because it uses Sunny Day, which makes Solar Beam hit in one turn.
I wonder what happens if I put a pokemon's level as 0.5
Egg?
2XD
2nah, Egg is n/a, I think
And egg and a half then.
-d
Once I changed the save data so that there was an egg in daycare, even though no pokemon were in it.
02o hai
o.o The old couple are pokemon?
/me hides
It took about 20 steps to hatch, and it came up with a missing no. kind of picture.
It's picture in the menu was a question mark, lol.
2O_o
SO
I like food
Then it disappeared completely, but I had one space in my party that I couldn't put any pokemon in.
o.o
2O_p
2That's... wait.. you hacked
/me squeaks
2never mind, then
I don't know why people call it hacking, it's editing the save data, hacking would be using AR codes, or injecting code into the game.
07well, altering it in any way that's not available during normal gaming
2hm
2Yeah, I agree with Kyu ^-^''
Definition of hack: "Informal To alter (a computer program): hacked her text editor to read HTML."
07it may not fit into the normal definition of hack, but it's still altering something
Altering the save data is not hacking. :P
07well people consider it hacking if you can't do that by JUST playing the game
Oh well, people are wrong. :)
2Well, so are you, I'd say, but then we're both wrong, I think
2Wait... I just confused myself. XD
I am wrong, just not about this.
07hacking and altering are different things, but it's still lumped together into "cheating"
07XD
2Well, we both thick we're right, and that the other is wrong; hence, we're both both right /and/ wrong
2C:
Fair enough, lol.
2LOL
Agree to disagree
2NO
/me 2BRICK'D
2Disagree to agree
2C:
Then you'd be agreeing to disagree to agree.

Wow, this guy is messed up, he thinks you should have loyalty to games. O_o
2O_o
2Whut?
"Loyalty" to games?
Elaborate.
He has problems.
2O.o
That's his personal preferrence.
Nothing wrong with that.
02indeed
2Hmm does make sense, though
2You have to say that
I don't see how it makes sense.
2O_o
02the world's next yugi

2GUESTCHAIR
So, intepret it the right way then?
2SKYBANANER
/me 2makes a right turn, and walks into a brick wall
2Ow!
Like I said, just his personal preferrence.
It's not.
He could've used better words to describe it. :q
2It is
He was going on about "Would you betray your country?" as though games, and real life are the same thing.
He definitely wasn't talking about personal prefference.
2O.o it does make sense that way
XP
He was saying the not always using the same class on games was disloyal, and that we were all disloyal.
2:O
2It just... does
I find it hard to see your point of view unless you explain. :P
Gonna go eat
That has nothing to do with it.

02sis
07Hi Umbreon!!
07^v^
02eep.
Hey guys
/me is here very early... for him
/me gives you rocky rococo for breakfast :D
/me huggle Umbreon
/me eats
02fine
02you can have some too
07where's arti y'all?
07LOL
02:)
/me eats more
Yum, more Rocky's :)
07^-^
02hasn't come on yet
07Ah
07Ok
I overate there yesterday after moving my sister into her apartment. She has way too much crap.
02btw rocky rococo = pan style pizza
02very thick :)
Super slice + breadsticks + cookie + Diet Coke. I was full for the rest of the day.
it was sooo good
02when i go to pokemon league on weds
02guess where it's held :P
Rocky's here?
02no
02rocky's here
02can you imagine that
02being at rocky's
Awesome. That's a surprise, yeah...
02playing pokemon for 3-4 hours
You get a buffet, too, no doubt
02nah
You have a big room for it? We do here.
02no
02we sit out in the open :D
02we usually take one corner of the building
how many people?
02it's a brand new league
Ah, okay
02so it's quite small, i'd say 5-10 people
Ah, so it's just picking up. Good luck!
02i go to that league
02order a number 1 combo
02drown the pizza in the hot sauce they have out on the counters
02then at the table, pour on the crushed red pepper and the other stuff
02darnit what is that called again
02that white stuff in a shaker
Parmesan?
I usually just get the number one combo and don't bother with anything else. The pepperoni pizza is so good as is
02yes
02i can't argue with that
02:)
07Umbreon just likes spices
02honestly though
02their hot sauce fails
02it has very little flavor in it, and the hotness i can barely notice
Their pizza sauce doesn't, at least
02great flavor, it's hot enough to be noticeable if you put enough of it on
I like my pizza simple. Usually just pepperoni, though sausage is good too
02i'm not a fan of sausage
Well, Rocky's does it well
02pepperoni though D:
07pepperoni

6see, high school is nice because you can easily be prepared
06That could takes ages, Kipi :P
6But I don't know what supplies I'll need for college o_o
OwO;;
Come to the UK then you won't need to go to college, lol
Just kidding xD
6lol
Well you don't really need it here unless you want to be a doctor or something like that.
And you need to have rich parents here to go.
6heck
6my online college bookstore doesn't seem to have any of the textbooks I'm suposed to have
For example to become a doctor it costs £100,000 all in all - that can buy you a big house ehre
here*
And most people will never make that amount of money in their lifetimes
6but I don't even know if I need to buy them or not
Why don't you check Amazon.com for used textbooks maybe?
6I will, but I still have no idea what's going to happen
6like........I've gotten no word or anything
Ah ok.
I'm going to do a degree by distance learning though while I'm working so I'll get there in the end.
I hope it all goes well for you, Aurora. If I lived in the US I'd go to the local college and just stay at home, lol, I'm like that.
6I hate my life >_<
wb
Absol~
Aurora, from what I hear you've got a life most people would dream of - your parents own their own home, are still together, have good jobs probably, and you're going to college.
6my parents aren't together
Oh sorry thought you said 'my parents are calling me' the other day, my bad
6I have tendency to say parents, but that generally refers to my dad and stepmom
I just meant, I wish I had all those things, I don't have any of that
6I know
I hope college goes well for you!
what are you studying?
6I should be lucky, but I'm the one paying for college
6I don't know anymore
6I wanted to study art, but I really don't think I'd make it
Your art looks pretty good to me
^^
6we have student loans
6but I'm scared to get them
6I'm paying with money I've earned from work
Ok
6I guess I'm just letting every little thing get to me
6this is the first year I'll really be on my own (all my friends are still in high school)
Hi guest
6well the good thing: I'll be going to junior college, so I'm still living at home

8.1 kilobyte/s
12Slideshow and full view works fine.
12It's the thumbnails that take forever
nice photos
12Thanks I'm really proud of the close up of the rails

were did you go arti?
/me needs hus daily supply of kyu
12We decided to insure the car for those two days by the way, so we were able to go many places :> which is good.. because if we'd gotten the train, we'd not have been able to get back today, there are no trains running on a Sunday from that line....
12and we didn't even check....
aah
where did you go?
12Well we stayed in St Bees and went to Ravenglass this afternoon
nice
did you go on the ratty?
12Last night we actually drove into Whitehaven to get a look at the meteors :>
2:O
;_____________________________;
did you get rickrolled?
o_O
12LOooool.. yes got loads of photos
12and what do you mean did we get Rickrolled?
pfft
0_0
12and yeh I know, I'm really sorry but it would have been really awkward meeting up with no plans or anything..
Rick Astley did a concert here last night
12OMFG
12SO THATS WHAT WAS PLAYING HAHAHAHAHAHA
???
12ALL OF WHITEHAVEN HAS BEEN RICKROLLED XD
where in the mothertown did you go?
wtf?
lol
12But seriously, someone told us everything was booked because of a concert, we got the last room in the whole of St Bees
12Nethertown?
12Ovo or what do you mean?
mothertown, silly way of saying Whitehaven
Nethertown
12Weeeird
I think I went there once for a barbeque
it was... fun
12We went onto a hill where it was dark, just outside of Whitehaven but we had to pass through it
12Then we watched the meteors
ended up on a trampoline with a bunch of people I didn't know
and ya
12I saw seven ^^
I had my window open to watch them
12Omg ST Bees is amazing though
12Does it normally have like, NO tourists?
well
12Because it was strangely quiet..
I don't really know, I don't go there very often tbh
12lol ok
12Well we really loved it
I would presume that if the place you went to was fully booked... it might be a sign
12Yeh but that was because of the concert apparenty
12*l
so where do you think people would go before the concert?
12O__o?
aaaasdfg
12I have no idea, there wasn't anyone in St Bees
12Well, very few people
it's normally like that then I think
12and that was both days
12That's awesome
12It's so much better than around the Lake District
welllll
the Lake District is just full of people
12Yeh I can't stand it :/
it's like, have you seen some of the paths?
12It's good for walking and that's it
12Probably yeh
they've been eroded so much it's disgusting
12Yeh we added to that LOL
>(
oh and there's lots of other things you can do if you don't mind risking death
12It's better to have eroded paths than eroded mountain
gosh, Arti, you're so lucky living so close to all coasts in fact
12Like?
ghyll scrambling, kayaking, canoeing
12Hehe
surfing
!!!
12Maybe when it's really hot and not windy
rock climbing
12Rock climbing yeh <3
caving
12We went on that coastal walk by the way
yes?
did you see the best nuclear processing facility in the world?
12Yep
12LOOOL
yeah that THAT GERMANY
and JAPAN
and CANADA
...I think
2oeo
12So, how much of the area does that nuclear power plant provide for?
/me 2pokes BF
2D:
well it doesn't
2It's not their fault
12Doesn't it?
I forget it's proper name
but
it enriches nuclear material
2Besides, the governments were doing what they thought was right
for re-use and putting in nukes
10bbl
12Oooooh I see, where is your nuclear power plant then?
2Does it mean that all the citizens agreed?
and there is no nuclear power plant
2Wasn't that about WWI and WWII?
2O_o
uh
no, not really
12LOLZ
I was talking about NUCLEAR MATERIALS
12People read too much into what BF says
2OH
2Sorry
and last time I checked, Canada wasn't on the Axis
2^-^;;
2Yeah.. you said I think
2So, I assumed you forgot some of the countries that were in the Axis and Union
yeah, so there's no nuclear power plan
t
2Sorry
12Not anywhere?..
2MIB
I can't tell you where on earth our sweet electricity comes from
and nope, not in Cumbria
they will build some though
12I could swear you said there was one that powered your town.
hmm
12Did you move house? lol
possibly, I thought there was one too, until a couple of years ago
12XD
Sellafield itself is powered by a natural gas plan within the perimeter
we have erm
lots
and lots
2o3o
12Ok :>
of wind turbins in the bay and along the coast
12Yeh I noticed
I think there might be a coal plant somewhere... but I don't know where
12Well I saw a few ^^
yes
I like the ones in the bay
they should looks nice when they're done
the plan is to provide local energy renewably and sell nuclear energy on
2:O
since iirc they will be building two reactors at Sellafield in the future
12brbrb
2k
yes
12Back
12BF, when we go back to St Bees we'll try and visit you - but we need plans
12Could always just say hi and then be on our way I guess
12Like stop over at Whitehaven, we passed it on the way to St Bees anyway

6wat the heck is a cosigner?
2Dunno
/me 2hugs
6you would know, right.
6?
2Mebbe
7LAG
A person who signs his or her name to a loan agreement, lease or credit application. If the primary debtor does not pay, the cosigner is fully responsible for the loan or debt.
Many people use cosigners to qualify for a loan or credit card. Landlords may require a cosigner when renting to a student or someone with a poor credit history.
7Wow, that was laggy. o_o
6ouch
6i stubbed my toe

06The wings just won't fit in a switch.
/me drew a Lugios wolf IRL, though :D
/me sketches it on Photoshop
2My solution to not doing any of my reports is to flop down on my bed with "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and tell my mom I'm going to do the summer reading. o3o
06AQSWERGYGTFRD

6they put up an announcement on the electronic sign in front of the school saying for all graduates to pick up their diplomas at the office
6it said for all summer
6I went four different days and it was closed
2:O
6later, the announcement was taken down, and reannounced three weeks later for graduates to pick them up after august 10th

2LOL
/me 2hands Roara an out-of-date soda
2:D It's a soda, isn't it?
6ew
2XD
Aurora, how did that give you goosebumps?
6...
6>_>
6it's hard to explain
2Because it's so deep and emotional
6but for someone in my position, I can relate
2QAQ
/me 2cries
6o_o
2It's true, divorcing seems to be a fad now. I have SO many friends with divorced parents... It's always more saddening for me than is is for them to talk about it...
2Hm...
6ya, it's hard to go through
6at least I was young so it didn't hit me as hard
6but still
/me 2hugs Roara
2hm... a very common excuse at my school is, "I left my textbook at my dad's, but I stayed with my mom this week"
2It just makes me so sad
I hate it when people divorce. =[
6unfortunately yes
6and I've used that excuse (only...it was for real, so not exactly an excuse lol)
lol
2Yeah
2XD I understand
2It just makes me sad that situation is available
Society is destroying society. D:
6available because osmetimes it's the only way
2Yes.. but...
2 3:
2I live in a similar situation, however
2but not quite
I reckon my parents will get divorced as soon as I and my sister are at university.
2D:
6I'm watching my family here deteriorate, and there's a possibility that I'll be living through a second divorce
6not many people can say they've gone through that
2Hm... my parents are close... they're still married... but they live on opposite sides of the globe because of my dad's job
I've a good family.
2And staying with my dad isn't an option
I think that people are straying from morals too much.
6You /think/?
6I /know/
I think I read somewhere that 50% of all marriages in New York (I think, not sure) end in divorce.
6dari, I read something like that too
I don't speak in absolutes. D:
2Except for my sister, but she decided to spend one year of school in Japan. Likewise, though... she can't visit us.
2Hm....
I mean it like that, I just don't say it.
2O.o
6XD
No one takes marriage seriously any more. :(
6I know many people who do
6and many who don't
If they did, they wouldn't rush into it, then get divorced.
/me 2huggles everyone close
6graar
6I almost want to change my design
6I want something S/somewhat/ natural
2 3:
6but I wont
6one thing that might change though is the hair
2XD
6I might be getting a haircut tomorrow
/me shaves Roara
6and I might not
6o_
6o
Ish faster
2XD
/me puts her hair under her hat
2LAWL
/me 2gnaws it off jaggedly
2:3
like a brick
or the bill of my other hat
o_O?!
2O_o
/me waves around her tail
it's cold.
6:P
2XD
/me 2points out that /her/ hair is already short
2G'night, Cynder
I'm trying to grow my hair
2XD
2And technically
2Even if you cut it shorter, I'd just be happy
/me 2perfers short hair. o3o
2XD
6I can't stand my hair short
6I love long hair
/me 6has discovered that when her hair is in a ponytail, it is a dangerous weapon
6I kept tail-slapping my coworker today
lol
2XD
2LOL
6I turn my head to rapidly, and the force causes my tail to SWOOSH
6and whap, into someone's face
o:
Hi sushi
2I prefer short hair, because it just.... goes better with the view people have of me
Hello Aero :)
who said my name?
...
oh
lol
Sushi? O_o
2If I went to school after summer with long hair, and used an accent, people would probably ask who I was.
2XD
2Hey Sushi!
LL
*LOL
yup Sushi :3
2:3
2Hmm....
They'd recognise facial structure, and eyes. :P
2I know someone with the nickname Sushi
:o
2it's 'cause of her last name; people are too lazy to learn how to pronounce it properly. XD
2...
/me 2just realized something
/me wonders
2...
2LOOK!! IT'S A LATIOS T-SHIRT!! :O
2*random*

/me 2pokes at a camp t-shirt somewhere in her room that's gray and blue. "There!"
2:D
/me 2runs
/me keeps staring at the t-shirt for some more minutes
/me squeaks.
2XD

/me 2pokes Quilava with a stick
/me squeaks again.

Yes, I can see that
There was one day where there was a lot of activity
Last week some time
But it's been pretty dead other than that
That doesn't really make sense to me
Wouldn't you have /more/ free time over the summer and not less?
Well I suppose he thought everyone was away.

So I spent like two hours last night researching kidnappings.
XD
Lol, why?
It's interesting.
I don't know.
What made you want to research kidnappings?
Recent news.
Ah.
Kid taken at like eleven years old came back recently as a twenty nine year old.
With a lot more kids though, lol.
Lol.
And then there's Genie.
...What? O_o
A kid who had no human contact her whole life, except for like the one guy who took her.
She just sat in a box all day staring at a coat.
I think the word is feral child.
*term
...Ok, that's weird.
Yeah. Imagine that, though.
As we now reach the ten minutes of silence, I shall break it.

/me is racking his brain for lyric ideas.
Or is it wracking?
I don't think that's a word
I dunno
Oh, it is, I've seen it in books plenty of times.
I just can't recall how they spelled it.
Yeah
I meant I'd never seen it spelled with the W before
Oh, gotcha.
Then it's probably just 'r'.
Could be
I'm not known for my spelling skills
Hi

You might be able to sell more art if you can draw digital pics though
06Actually, I'm only almost done with the first one.

07digital/traditional doesn't really make much of a difference
but actually i dont no anything about digital art
To some people, Kyu.
It'll broaden her customer base.
07if you're an ok artist, but you talk on da a lot to get people to know you

I don't think I've downloaded a new version yet
Not for me :P
Don't
It sucks
idk
all the ones ive downloaded work fine lol
I've been using Google Chrome
I don't like Chrome
I prefer Internet Explorer.
:P
Firefox kept freezing on me
can depend widly on your operating system
HP.
Mine works perfectly with FireFox for some reason
Just Windows XP
12o.o
/me realizes too late that there's a Gooey Bomb attached to the banana x-x

What do you use?
/me roflcopter's
It was one of the only ones that didn't come with Vista
lol
Vista has been cooperating with me well surprisingly
I think mine only worked well at home because my dad was there to patch it up
Wow, that is surprising. Vista seems to only be good for normal family PCs.
He was always having to fix stuff on that computer

They make you download that or pay for your own
at my college
I'd pay for my own
Mine wasn't on the list of acceptable ones
AVG
what was acceptable?
Don't remember
Kaspersky was one of them
07lol
But I don't want to pay for it
What is your perspective on Nortom 360?
*Norton
I tried it
didn't like it
We used to have that
It made the computer run really slow
So we uninstalled it
yup
my dad put it on his pc
ran slower then hell
Because is pretty much backs up all of your files, taking up all of the space.
No space = slower.
2GUYS GUYS GUYA
2 8D I just figured something out
that's what they make External harddrives for
You're not packing?
/me runs
Kaspersky funnels all of the malicious programs into a box

Aww.
You should be able to put it on the white list
so it doesn't block it
unless your school has set it of course
in which case you have no choice or option
No
I was able to unblock it
Or else I wouldn't be here, would I?
=P
idk you could have connected through another client of some sorts
that wasn't blocked
Sausage.
/me sells it in the stock market~
No, it blocked every client I tried
I couldn't figure out why I kept disconnecting at first
/me watches the stock market crash
... but you figured it out, right?
12oops...

I haz I writing sample :D
6Well, a decent rp post is about 4-5 lines in length. Try to balance between dialogue and description, as just pure one or the other is boring. Too often do I see pure dialogu
6never rush things. Let it all play out over a series of posts, not just three or four.
2:3
Do you wanna see mah writing sample? D:<
/me 2is very bad at explaining; listen to Roara
2XD Sure!
/me neck is aching me and hi sleepy
/me gets a link
6pleasew

/me flees
/me poffelz
07baii
12hmmm
And usually my posts are longer D:
6o-o
6you sure thats not for a fanfic?
Eh, it was about a year back that I used it. I found it in notepad haha
6that seems to be more single story told, not collaborative (rp)
2XD
2Which reminds me
Maybe it was, Aurora.
I really don't know XD
6we need to start that collab fic
/me 6goes off topic
2XD Yeah
07Hm
6anyways, in rps, you can't really describe scenes. Because everyone is involved, they all need to ship in
Collab fic?
6chip
6dugdg
6Ika, yea
6like an rp, but not
07I feel like sharing a writing sample now
07Oo
Then it was probably a fanfic.
07though
Or just part of a story.
2XD
07More for feedback cause i feel like I could improve.
07Would you guys have a look at it ?
2XD Sure
07I hate english descriptions, I aint very good at it!
2:3
6of course
07Ok, posting it here in chat then
/me 6is often used for writing check
07since its not uploaded aywhere

6plot, characters, etc
2LOLk
2XD
2IF aero comes on
6But I do wanna keep a couple of my antagonists...if it's ok x3
2D:
2and I won't be here tomorrow
6why?
2sure, I don't mind
2XD
07”Are you absolutely certain you’re ready to perform the memorial flight?”
07“Yes. I’ve made my decision on that particular matter. Please quit bringing this up. You will not get things your way no matter how much you beg – you should know as much by now.”
07“So I see… By the way, are we being overheard? This conversation is to be kept purely confidential – I need to be sure we are not.”
07“Don’t worry Emilie, I assure you that my darling Hawkilara is asleep and Hawkins was invited to spend the might elsewhere. Carry on, please.”
07The hushed sound of two female voices carried over to where a little bird lay, tucked snugly under a carpet made from downy feathers. It was midnight and she was supposed to be resting, yet she could not sleep for reasons unknown. Her eyes fluttered open as she heard her name, and she blinked in an attempt to clear her mind, feathers ruffling and fluffing up once she’d settled into a comfier position.
07This was her mum and an acquaintance of hers conversing; they perched atop a rock not far from the nest and sat there whilst discussing matters which weren’t meant for her ears. However, her curiosity was ignited and the temptation to listen in became irresistible. So she lay there, keeping perfectly still in order to maintain the illusion of sleep, and unaware as they were, the two adults kept talking.
07o3o
07The other female gave a mirthless laugh in reply.
12o.o
2XD
07“A solo mating flight to honour the memory of the bird I love, taking a new mate for the sake of the community and biding farewell with my offspring permanently. I can’t believe you’re trying to boss me around, believing I am this weak and easily swayed.”
07Emilie was stunned into silence. Clearly, the fierceness took her by surprise. An awkward silence fell between the two until Emilie attempted to get back on topic.
07“Hawkilara is leaving the nest soon, then? And who are you taking as your new mate?”
07And in the nest, tucked under her carpet of warm, downy feathers, lay a broken-hearted Hawkilara, feeling as though her life was in shambles.
07the end :> sorry its not uploaded anywhere XD

Heheh.
6the work though is boring, well esign is anyway, watched some bloody 80s dvd over and over
6*design
Why do people have like [c=8] and stuff like that around their names?
On MSN
It doesn't do anything
10MSN Plus
6i dont know really
10If you get it.
10:3
6i havnt worked it out yet
10Want the link to MSN plus?
Sure
10Its MSN plus.
10;D
10and scripts.
6*facepalm*
10http://www.msgplus.net/
6oh so the c= stuff are scripts on MSN plus?
10just download it
10and you'll see the colors.
10:3
Eh
I already downloaded live
10><
And I can't figure out how to get rid of the old version
10download MSN Plus.
Three versions might be a bit too much :P
Tried Add/remove?
Yes
It doesn't show up there...
10Download it here..http://download.live.com/Messenger?CMXID=2120.6659E8F5-0797-4FA5-978A-17A208C59AFB&WT.srch=1
It isn't a new version I don't think, it's an addon for it, and not created by microsoft.
It's annoying because it always signs me in automatically when I start my computer
10its an addon
10mhm.
10Right click.
10Exit.
10O:
Nope
10Ah.
10Nevermind.
Ok...
Shouldn't it have uninstalled the old version when I downloaded Live?
I would have thought so
It said it was going to =/
10Uhmm
10I dunno.
10Click start.
10All programs
10Look for "windows live"
10Hover over it
10Click Windows Live Messenger
10Try that.
10It didn't uninstall the old MSN version on my comp.
I know at least how to stop the old version of MSN starting up, but involves downloading something, so I'm not sure if you'd want to do it.
10So mabye not on yours either :O
I found it
10Who cares about the downloading >:3
10Unless it's a virus. x_X
C:\Program Files\Messenger
10: D
10YOU WIN.
At one point I just moved the folder to the recycle bin so it would stop signing me in :<
Lol.
10:>
10Does it look like that?
10But..
10the red doesnt count
10Lol that's a skin from MSN Plus
10O:
6?
Yeah that's it
I just downloaded it a couple weeks ago
10Yay.
10You're safe.
10O:
Not yet
Lol, ok.
Mostly they've just been assigning us a lot of reading so far
Oh right.
So many people told me how college work is so much different than high school, but so far it's not really
6im doing history so i probaly will soon :(
Well, if you will take history.
6lol history is easy for me :), just my hand writing is crap
6and ive found out the cause of it, i hav dspraxia
Lots of writing = time consuming = not easy
6*dyspraxia
I've never heard of that before.
6giv us a sec i will find a link
6nor did i tell my mate laura told me about it, shes got it to, it explains my rubbish memory to
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_dyspraxia
6some of the things in it are related to me, but ive just got dspraxia, not developmental of it
How did you find out that you had it?
6my friend laura, shes got it, her hand writing isnt that good to, but shes got different symptons to me
6she told me about it and i looked at it and noted the ones that applied ot me
6bad hand writing, short term memory loss, organisation problems and theres a couple of others to i tihnk
10At least you don't have.
/me 10gulps.
10PKU
10I have it.
10I HATE it.
6PKU?
10People treat me differently because of it.
6what is it
10http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylketonuria
6ah gotcha
The deficieny of an enzyme? Surely that's like people with diabetes cannot produce enough insulin.
They use bacteria to make insulin.
Can't they make this enzyme?
6dunno, obviously not as they havnt thought to yet, or it cant be done i dunno
What kind of foods have phenylalanine in anyway?
6dunno, i got a D in my science GCSE :S so im not the best person to ask, one bloody mark off a C...
6lol fair point kk
You did a science GCSE? And not the 3 separate sciences as separate GCSEs?
6yeh
O_o
6i did rural science tahst why
wth is that?
6so i did another GCSE in science, with all of them combined together
6oh rural is basucly farm science in other words
wth is farm science?
6my school is one of only 4 schools in england with a farm attached to it
wth is farm science?
Oh.
6to put it bluntly
6got a B in that though :D
Cool.
How many options were you allowed to choose for GCSE?
6which mostly consisted of me driving a tractor in a field, and doing wheel spins in it XD splattering teh girls behind greta way to get a GCSE
6lol
Lol.
6er
6cant rememer hang on
6one science (rural), one tech (grpahics), and 3 other options
6on top of the compulsory ones
6so 5 i was allowed to choose
Lol, we got to choose 3 things, and whether we did French or German.
6lol unlucky, i choose against neighter i did languages up until year 9 then quit
6what u doing for GCSE?
I am doing Latin, Tech (electronics), and Economics.
Then the compulsory stuff.
6cool, i didnt know latin was still being taught though
Only at grammar schools really.
6ah gotcha, that makes sense
6guess i will cu all later bye
10Seriously.
10I can't name all of them.
10I can name a couple.
Just give an example.
10A LOT of gums
10Some candies
10I can't have much protein..
10Im allergic to seafood
10and..
10nuts
Hm.
10Nuts, seafood, phenyalaine, and i cant have much of milk or eggs
10And lots more..
Gums is definitely not a word.
Except if you're referring to the gums in your mouth.
Like what your teeth are attached too, lol.
10I have to get stabbed in the foot
10every month if my level is low
10every 2 weeks if it is high
XD
/me 10sighs.
10I am angered easily.
And now I get to correct you.
to*
What did I spell incorrectly then?
:P
10I have to drink this drink that tastes like the curse word that begins with an s. ;)
10EVERY day..
Swahili?
10:P
10Gum
Not a spelling mistake, a word usage mistake.
10Spelling mistake.
10O:
But yeah, my mistake.
10TYPO.
10O:
10Ever heard of it?
No.
It's not in my vocabulary.
10Niiice.
10Look it up then.
10(;
/me EXTEMPORANEOUSLY looks it up.
...O_o
It's an inside joke.
Which makes it decent.
10Nah.
10It doesn't bother me.
10Idc.
10Whatever it means Idc.
I love how eccentric is used before scientist/inventor 90% of the time.
10<::>
Lol.
Seriously. I rarely see the two apart.
Or three, interchangibly.
Well probably because they think completely differently to how people normally think, and come up with new ideas that other normal people wouldn't ever dream of.
Oh, crap. Egan is abroad. I'm laing low...
*laying
If Egan is abroad, then why do you need to lay low?
Because if she's abroad, the opposite would be below... well, in some ways,
Ok.
Facebook begins to get extremely dull(er) when people being to decide that "turning their swag on" is a clever status update,
*.
Define GCSE.
10What the heck is swag?
10IM TIRED OF HEARING IT.
Swagger means like a way someone walks, swag is just a word that rappers made up and have decided makes sense. :]
10I hear it in rap songs yah.
10"I got some super good swaggg"
10Wth.
-in*
Don't tell me you don't know what sixth form is.
10My new self is decenter than my old self.
10I think.
10Isn't it?
10:|
Honestly, no I don't.
Decenter...?
Nope. Never heard those here. *shrug*
It's what you would call "12th/13th grade"
10LEAVE MY ENGLISH ALONE.
10T___T
There's no thirteenth grade in the US, but yeah I get it now.
I don't know what you mean by decenter.
I'm not making fun of your English.
I still don't know what decenter is.
10My new self is better than my old self.
10Is what I mean.
At "11th grade" we get GCSEs which are qualifications we can use to show employers and get jobs, then we do A levels which are more advanced than GCSE in what would be 13th grade, they are qualifications.
In English for example we do some test and coursework, to get our GCSE.
You can get A* to E.
Oh, I get what you mean now. Since I've been homeschooled for a lot of my life, I wouldn't know too well.
Anything else is a fail.
Here's the extent of what I know:
10Peanuts are good.
10:3
You get homeschooled too?
I'm not right now.
I have been in the past.
^ Good point
There are mastery tests or aptitude tests, but I'm not sure if there are things you can take that would be specifically for jobs, but there easily could be.
/me lolz at awkward silcene.
*silence
Pwn't.
:P
For example here with most jobs you need at least a C grade at GCSE or they won't employ you.
C grade in English
*
Ohhh, now I know what you mean.
Well, through a lens darkly but more now.
Now when you say they won't employ you, can you reatke that and is the first one final?
*retake
I think you can go back and retake them, yeah.
Although you have to pay to do it.
Then yeah, it would some form of a mastery test. Now are they for certain fields of occupation or general?
And also that might fall into the lines of someone who didn't finish high school, too. Like a GED diploma.
They are general, although with some jobs such as being an engineer you need quantum physics.
quantum mechanics*
Mhm. Makes sense to me. And also I was reading this Curious Events book, and it said that at UCL the corpse of Jeremy Bentham is present at main meetings and otherwise rests in the main hallway or soemthing.
I lol'd. Much.
UCL?
University of London/University College London.
Oh.
I just thought that a two-hundred year old dead guy shouldn't exactly be so active.
Lol.
And I guess a lot of students pranked it and stole his head.
LOL
So now it's locked away somewhere when not in use.
"In use" Lol.
And when he's in a minute, he's listed as "Present, but not voting."
*meeting
Why did I say minute? Lawl.
Lol, yeah that doesn't really make sense, the keys are no where near each other.
10Life is just so easy when you're a small creature in a cage.
10O: Hamster.
Life is boring when you're a hamster.
10Heheh.
Hamsters are probably the stupidest rodents of all.
10Not when I have them.
10No actually.
10They are smart..
No they aren't.
10My hamster got out 5 times already.
And what do you base that theory on?
Rats are clever.
10And, there was duct tape on the cage.
10Each time.
- for rodents
He got out that many times? Proves my point./
Now way he's gonna survive for long out of that cage.
10She
10They are naturally born loners.
Whatever, she. :P
Rats are pretty cool, my friend has a few.
It's kind of funny how prominent thair schrodums are.
*their
Oh, and the fact that the hamster escaped it just because you have a crappy cage.
Duct tape is not at all secure btw.
10They are adorable too.
10 8D
It probably came loose about 5 minutes after you stuck it down.
/me sighs.
So because they are adorable and try to leave the safety of their protective enviroment makes them really smart?
XD
10U-U
Cute things ~= Stupid things
10I don't need reasons for my beleifs.
But what about your beliefs?
:P
Yes you do, if you are going to disagree with us when we say hamsters are stupid.
I don't want to hear about these 'beleifs'.
10My beliefs are.
10Hamsters are adorable.
That's one...
10Hamsters ARE intelligent.
That doesn't make them clever.
No they aren't.
10Hamsters are actually clever and intelligent
Those both mean the same things.
10If they were dumb they wouldn't get out of their cage
10:P
Yes they would.
And they're dumb because they try to leave the cage.
10No, because if they are stupid, how would they know how?
10Well, believe what you wish.
10You're not changing my mind.
Take lemmings.
10So please stop trying
They know where you open the door each time.
10(=
Their instincts effectively manage their population.
They gnaw it till they bleed.
It opens.
10I got bored.
10It sucks but
10I love my hamster 8D
And mice can get as flat as they need to, pretty much.
Close to hwo hamster can.
*how
10Hamster also can.
Read the above.
:/
10I once put her into this colorful cage.
10She unlatched it too.
10U_U
But then both cannibalize their young so that's another negative quality.
:P
10Proves mabye not all hamsters are smart.
10But, some are.
10;D
So colorful means it works well? Lol.
10She used her teeth to unlatch it.
10O.O;
That's like saying monkeys are exceedingly clever because if you put 5 billion of them in a room with typewriters eventually one will type the full works of Shakespeare.
10Well eventually all hamsters get out of those colorful things easy.

10http://www.petsathome.com/Assets/PetsAtHome/products/1/4/0/14041_l.jpg
But it's giving me some good laughs.
10Only, wider.
10(:
So I'm not complaining.
10That's the cage.
...
Your hamsters climber out.
hamster*
10She also climbs good O.o;
climbed*
10I'll show you her REAL cage.
I had that thing too.
LOl.
10Thats her pen..
To unlatch that, your hamster need to lift up part of it about 10cm of the ground and push it away from her.
So I say that it is impossible for your hamster to have opened it.
She climbed out.
I wish we ran on metrics.
10How come it was locked then?
10And then it was unlocked with about an inch open
10and she was out of it
Simple, you're lying. :)
10When I came back.
Or she made up the whole situation, haha.
Hamsters don't have the ability or strength to lift that.
10I should totally fking of took pictures.
You can't take pictures of something in your head.
And you could have opened it yourself.
Woah, Dari, it must be true now that an abbreviated swear coupled with slang was spoken.
10>_>
:P
10I'm going to play with her right now.
Lol.
10I love hamsters, and nobody can change my mind
That still doesn't make them clever.
10^^; Please, never try again.
Ew, playign with your hamster?
Kidding.
And we didn't try to make you dislike hamsters.
And stuff.
Just make you see the sense that they are NOT clever.
10Well you cant change that either
10I'll bring her down her
10*here
10One sec
Yes, there are some poeple too stupid to learn. :(
Change what? The fact of the matter is that when it comes to intelligence all rodents including hamsters are pretty far down there.
I hope that didn't kill the chat too bad. ;)
Lol.
Apparently if you run over a sheep dog in New Zealand you get charged with manslaughter.
That doesn't even make sense. It'd be like canineslaughter.
I don't know it was something to do with them being able to herd sheep which apparently makes them intelligent.
Although I'm pretty sure you can train any dog which scares sheep to be a sheep herding dog.
We bought Manhattan Island for twenty four dollars.
Bargain hunters, lol.
O_o

10What does that period mean?
10._.;
It means I have nothing to say, but am typing that so you know I'm here.
10I can easily look at the user list.
10Thank you. ;O
And you know by looking at the user list I'm not AFK?
10But ok.

Which I was on.
I haven't spoken in the last about 4 hours.

But I wasn't.
10..
10Bah.
Just no one was talking.

10Mibbit plays a noise?
10O.O
MIbbit XD
LIke i'd use that shit
^ I agree. Mibbit = crap
10Excuse me.
10Mibbit=Awesome.
XD
that's a laugh
Mibbit = fail
All webclients = fail
10wait.
It's not as bad as the ac webclient
but mibbit is pretty damn bad
10is that why your people are blue?
Yes.
10What do you use then?
I use something magical
10O:
Can you use scripts on it?
I don't know
I think so
10mIRC.
10Dari uses mIRC right?
Ok, that's pretty good for a web client.
10is mIRC good?
10o_o'
and chatzilla is basically a webclient
mIRC is basic
mIRC isn't very "pretty" graphically, but I like it.
10O;
10Should I download mIRC?
10._.;
Ice Chat is pretty graphically and basically functions the same as mIRC
You don't need its other functions.
KVIRC is crazy though
10Hmm
it looks nice and has its own scripting language XD
10I'll jsut try it out.
10C:
I need a keygen
mIRC script is about as simple as it gets though.
WAREZ.
XD
10Eww
10You gotta pay for mIRC..
10-.-
Yeah
10That's digusting.
or use a keygen :P
mIRC is free.
10>: O
Permenantly.
Looophole~
10It says I have to pay.
It just uses a guilt pay window.
Which everyone ignores.
10LOL
10(=..

10I just hit connect.
10Now what?
...

You might want to put in the server.
10how?
Save it to your server list.
10o_O;
Or manually connect each time.
It's irc.epic-chat.net
10where do I put irc.epic-chat.net?
To just connect quickly now, type /server irc.epic-chat.net
/me facedesks
10hmm
You might as well stick to nice simple mibbit.
You don't really want any of mIRC's functions anyway.
10then do i type /join #spyrochat
Yes

Ooh

In this context the US passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856 giving citizens discovering a source of guano the right to take possession of unclaimed land and entitlement to exclusive rights to the deposits. However, the guano could only be removed for the use by citizens of the United States.[2] This enabled US citizens to take possession of unoccupied islands containing guano.

12alright alright
You can turn the tap on and off.

Oh wait, you cna't turn the tap on and off. :(
12Oh.

12ooh no i dont
12Muhahaha
/me 12puts on compatibility view.
12Thats good IE.
So its actually a game? O.o NICE!
12: D it works now
12YUP!
No, if IE were good, you could just view it without needing any modes.
12 8P
12You should join.
Like you can with firefox.
12Just need to download. O:
12No paying.
12XD.
Ok, if the download isn't too big, that game is gunna get hacked.
Games without hackers = win. Almost always have no protection.
Downloading
12^^
Oh wait, you can turn the tap on and off.
7she's not bright, is she?
12lionkingdom123
7He's going to hack the game you silly cow.
12newest member
/me 12face palms.
...
Wow.
Just wow.
12-.-;
Even more wow.
Now that is beyond stupid.
12why would they?
12Not as cruel as you two.
12:P
12You cant edit the files/hack.
I can.
And will, just to prove it.
:)
12>:\
12THE GAME MAKER SET IT THAt way
7Dari, you should put hostnames on file.
12oh why not tell me your username?
12;) I cant do anything about it can I/
7You should still put hostnames on a file.
12i got to admit.
12...
12Wait
Wait what?
12Do you have mac dari?!
Nope.
Windows all the way.
12phew..
12c:
7Macs = fail.
Although since you seem to think it's bad if I have a mac.
12what kind of computer is it?
I can run a virtual mac desktop on my pc.
Why tell you?
12example dell :|
Fail, I'm not stupid.
12btw dari.
?
12YOu cannot play IT on Mac.
12(:
12I was hoping you'd say yes...
12>_>
My roommate has a Mac
So why do you say "phew" if I don't have a mac?
12idk
The first few days she couldn't get on the internet
Mac looks nice.
Because you had to install McAffe which doesn't work on Macs
*McAfee
But they are crappy appart from that.
12>_<
Supposedly they're good for art and graphic design
12Why do TONS of people want them, and say they own?
I haven't used one since I was like 10, so I dunno
They're not good for software either.
Most stuff is made for windows or linux.
Although, basically no viruses for mac.
So you don't need AV.
Wow, this game looks fail.
Is there even anything to hack?
All people seem to do is run around and talk.
I hate games with nothing to do in them.
12Omg
12you can hunt
12get items

12you can go on some editing program other then paint
12hmmm..
12make skins for the game..
So there's no level system, or anything?
12theres your green health bar

I dunno, I don't really see the point in a game where you don't progress.
12until they are killed.
12its what you make it
Wth, it's basically like a second life with felines instead of humans.
I don't like games like that.

12>>
Ummm, I am trying to create a account for multiplayer, but the conenction request keeps failing
Do you use a router?
Ya
I don't know, it's possible, but then again, you might be wrong, and if you are wrong and ban someone for no reason, you might lose your mod poweres.

ummm
Spyroforum seems to be picking up in activity
yesyesyes!!!
The forum has never really been a problem
AAARRRTT!!!
02No emailing this time XD
all forums have dead time now and then
02http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=3612.0
XD almost looks like carrot!!
changes^
but yeah I miss the days when we had at least 20 users in here
Even #epic-chat is usually dead when I go on there, so apparently it's not just us?
Meh, I wish it was back how it used to be with around 20 people on, pretty constant flow on them.
this isn't a very big network
Yeah
compared to others
it's dismal
I want to make a channel
I don't know what about though
lol
Pokemanz.
Yes.
/me 7starts to turn black colored
Let's do it
XD
Lol.
D=
Anyone can register channels here, right?
wat you wanna talk about?
Yeah.
02Bleh
7not much
yup
OK
I only just noticed that RDX is an IRC op LOL.
When'd that happen?
He's been op for a while
like a month ago
Ah right.

02wb Altari
I lost my admin though ):
Server reset or something
02-l
02Atari! *shot*
Oh.
12lolz
just ask SR to give it back to you
Didn't really need it anyways
12hes an Alt Atari
All it did was make Mage complain at me when he was here
/me hides
10ty
10XD
02X3
/me 7sits in shadows
"Why are you admin, you don't know anything!"
XD
I never knew why he was even here
And he's hardly ever here.
SR's friend apparently
So...
I don't need it
If SR wants to give it back to me he can
But I don't really care much
all it's really good for is setting some special modes and being able to control operators
And only SR was supposed to be able to set the modes anyway
/me uses solar beam
I liked being able to kick the other ops and not get kicked back
:P
and the moderator in question doesn't even come here anymore so we don't need to worry about that :p
/me 7creates a solid pitch black bubble around himself
That was supposed to be secret, remember? :P
12o.o
Eh, whatever
like it matters lol
/me uses metronome
/me pokes the bubble
Woo, I have possestion of what used to be secret information. :D
/me 7's bubble doesnt break
metronome turned into flash
possesion* (sp?)
flash illuminates all darknesses
pretty much everyone knew anyways *yawns*
/me headtilts
Really?
7nothing works on the bubble guys, so stop trying
well to a degree lol
/me stabs the bubble with the Master Sword
/me watches it break X3
I only told you; who else did you tell?
7.........
XD
I didn't tell anyone
it was just obvious lol
I forgot Mage even existed, lol.
/me 7starts to move his mouth
I don't tell secrets :P
02wb Aero
/me 7then busts out lauging
Hai pplz~

7laughing^
I remember him because he lives in my state
12hai Aero
We never did meet each other though
/me huggles

I went swimming at mah cousin's pool a few minutes ago. X3
/me huggles back~
That would have been cool

/me 7smile quickly turns to a frown

/me 7looks at the ground and thinks very hard
/me tries to hug Chaos_Lugia

/me 7's bubble is in the way
and it wouldn't matter since it would be advertising SR's own sites :P
XD
Yes, sarcasm
7what are ya gonna try next, energy bending?
The gem project wasn't very secret.
Obviously :P
/me pops the bubble with Link's Master Sword again X3

Well we never told anyone what we were doing
Exactly...
Lol.

Full of Sues and Stus

Too many boring scenes

6I don't like feathers on my dragons. :P
I hate the damn elf princess person.
She should die.
/me 7's wing feather turn into sharp claws

6I noticed you guys have been talking a lot about the forum not being active anymore?
yeah
the forum is fine
6I'm unfortunately new here. Took me too long to finally join... I'm camera shy. :P
Oh yeah
I know how you feel
wow I have almost 5,000 posts
I apparently lurked for more than a year before joining my first forum
I have no life
6Sounds like I missed quite a bit... but I'll be around to post quite often. Spyro fan for... well since 1998 right here. :P
lol
I just looked at my first post as a guest
I have about 100 posts, lol.
It was in 2004
I joined in 2006
.__.
LOL
I read the forum since it started
i joined 3 days ago
Wow
didn't join until yeah...last year lol
Wth RDX. O_o
I probably don't even have 10000 collectively
Seriously?
6I was also the supervising Administrator of the forums for a long time... which is when I started picking posts up. :P
I probably have around 200 forum posts between all the posts on all the forums I've been on.
Why do I need a password to register my channel?
6These days I spearhead a new forum, been there 2 years and have 10,000 posts, lol.
6So yeah... you guys talk about having no life... look at me, haha.
lol
Yeah but when I joined I was annoying lol
6I'm quieter these days though, I stick to a few smaller forums that I really enkoy, SpyroForum being one of them. :)
6enjoy*
12wb ST~
nah you're still annoying ;)
damn
/me 7cries
lol

I have 2700 irc hours, and that's only since about last year, when I first started using irc about 3 years ago. :o
/me sighs
ppssst...god knows how many hours I have
lol
/me 7thinks im a idiot for what i said to Shiny....
seeing as how I leave this thing on all day
LOL
why wat did you say to shiny?
Wow, I've spent over 100 days on IRC.
That's pretty sad.
OK, let's see
7dont worry about it

Hai
oh i'm sorry :(
/me 7starts to turn good again
6debt sucks :P But I knew I'd be getting into that when I financed $12,000 on the truck a couple years ago.
oh
Meh, it's 2:29 am, I have to get up for school at 7 am. DX Although I expect it's even worse for you RDX, right/
Thanks

Hi Skylands
Why don't you guys have voice?
I'm working tomorrow
I haven't had a day off in
13 days
no i'm in pittsburgh and it 9:30
Isn't that illegal...?
6I "kind of" envy you. I don't have a conventional job anymore.
because the channel isn't set to give auto voice
I thought they had to give you a certain number of days off.
6And what I do now doesn't pay worth crap.
I'm not full time :P
What's the point of having voice at all if you can speak without it?
Ah.
7im a idiot.......
otherwise yeah
I do get days off
12no, you are not
7yes i am.............im stupid for saying that to Shiny
because you can set a channel mode that only lets those with voice or above speak
lucky
but after tomorrow
four days off
Ah
Lol, nice.
so I'm going to sleep
7and you know it
Another thing I'll have to learn how to do :P
u fricken lucky duck
/me sighs
start studying the list of modes
10...
10o-O
10?
what do any of you think of the legends of spyro
you shouldn't ask that in here lol
6I don't like it that much.
I didn't even bother finishing DotD
6I don't HATE it... the genre is just kind of "blah" to me.
6I own DotD for 360 just for the sake of having Spyro for my 360 since it's the only game.
i know it's kida random but still
6Played it long enough to get all but 1 achievement (2Player Mode)
yay
12hiya Ecco and wb~
6I asked my (only) friend if he wanted to play it with me so I could get the achievement and he said no. :(
hey LL and ty!
I have it on PS3
lol
6Well, "only" as in the only one I know in-person.
02wb Ecco
ha ha
I suppose I should make a channel now
ty too Shiny
everyone has one but me lol
have fun
12YOSHI!
i dont have one either
/me huggles
2SHINY
2LL
so your not alone
2XD
Make one
/me 2huggles the two back~
6I don't even know how to use IRC.
I will when I feel like moving
12:3
02I don't use all caps like that...
lol
You'd run it better than I would =P
/me is rather lazy at the moment
well because I know what all the modes are :P
/j #dm
well you are moving your fingers so techneclliy you are moving lol
12sorry if it annoys you, Shiny :(
don't get techincal it pisses me off lol
Autovoice command didn't work though ):
6aaaa moving fingers.... typing. I should be writing right now. :(
wel too late LOL
/me 7runs and hugs Shiny
I have this cool little thing called devoicing
108D
2NERO
2 8D
You have to add the flag. :o
/cs help
YOU WOULD'NT DARE
How do you do that? D:
/cs help flags
7LL........my point exactly, see what i mean?
12lolz
12o.o?
/me takes a second to ponder before actually wondering why he would ponder such a statment
oops
/me hugs back
/cs FLAGS #pokemanz *!*@* +V
7member what we were talking about
will help you with some of the commands
7i sorry @Shiny
2hi BL
thank you and your freind is an ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, do /cs help flags and read up on that bit.
now now no need for foul language
No problem.
7hi,
hey ... SHUT THE FUCK UP
Someone join my channel to see if my flag worked or whatever
NOW I'M DONE
/j #pokemanz
6woo
eh I can be a jerk when I'm tired
Don't scare the new membeers now
*members

Mem...Beer? :o
Yay it worked :D
i'm back BITCH
I get the feeling soon you'll be gone again.
6This is getting interesting.
Membeer lol
02ovo
I also know a cool little trick called glining
but that's for special cases :)
Oooh! Out with the IRC op powers!
Did what?
Lol.
nah
XD
I can't unless it's a network security or rule issue
in which case one immature member screaming swear words won't cut it lol
^w^
Isn't swearing at network staff against the rules?
:o
depends
2hi Kipi
seeing as how I was joking the entire time and not really caring it's not serious lol
/me 7i very very sorry Shiny
Network staff shouldn't have their own special case
I know, you never really care about anything. XD
lol
I care about something if I need to care abou tit lol
hence if it's "important"
So you think people should be allowed to swear at the police?
LOL
If you're going to ban someone for swearing at a network staff, you should be banned for swearing at anyone
if they want to get arrested go for it I don't care
7Back.
I don't see the difference
what the hell does this have anything to do with IRC :p
7And I'm (surprisingly) STRESSED.

WHAT
4hi
:P
Hi
4I think I may quit spyro now
Heh
4fantards are driving me up the wall
I don't blame you
4and FF.net is all SxC
yet another reason I only like the originals
No fantards
4Everytime someone tries something different
4they ignore it
2FF.net is kinda... strange. :P
4I think I may venture over to DMC and see how the fantards are there
Well that's obviously because SxC is teh bestest ship evarz
Duh
Why would you even /want/ to try anything different?
4i dunno
2In their defense I don't think there's a lot of material to work with with the Spyro franchise.
4I think my IQ is above 2
2Doesn't really give them an excuse for becoming monotonous though.
That's true
4Dracokon: make some shit up
4that's what I did
The TLoS story is totally cliche
And the originals weren't really plot-based
2Or borrow characters/environments from the franchise and insert them into your own worlds and characters.
2Or vice versa.
Except for YotD I guess
4I did that one
4ToD takes place when Malefor was a hatchling
4and I made 2 other siblings forhim and made a story
2There you go. More people should adopt that kind of concept or do something ORIGINAL.
2Then again I think it's safe to assume a lot of Spyro fan writers are fairly young.
2And mushy mushy.
4lol
4Hence why I just stick to my own writing
4I basically know every SxC plot
4OH NOZ, CYNDER IS DEPRESSED
2hehehehe
4SPYRO, BEING THE MANLY MAN, COMES OVER AND SAYS HE LOVES HER TO CHEER HER UP
4THEY KISS
4AND THEN SOME RANDOM BULLSHIT HAPPENS
2God that is so cut and dry but true, lmao.
2My origins in writing fiction came from my friends who were into Sonic the Hedgehog.
2You have no idea how much Sonic x Amy crap they produced.
2It was nauseating.
4I used to like SxC
4but that was when Cynder wasn't a brick
2I was never really into SxC.
2Doesn't mean I haven't seen/read it though. :P
4lol
I was never really into shippings in general
4I did memories and that was a large hit to them
I don't get why some people get so worked up over fictional pairings
It makes no sense
4and then I did a sequel and said 'fuckit' halfway
Oh yeah, was that where you ended it with that rant about Cynder?
4yeah
2lmao
That was epic
Yes, I said epic
Shoot me
4lol
4So yeah
4I am doing my own shit now
4and publishing a book in late 2010
4please put Brick instead of Cynder
4be funny as hell
I dunno if I'm supposed to mess with the word filter
Forgot the underscore :P
4Spyro doesn't rock btw...but...
haha
/me 4sighs
4I'M BORED
4THIS PLACE IS DEAD
/me would post an O rly owl except that meme is super old now
4yeah it is
That used to be the coolest thing ever in the SPAM forum in 06
:P
4lol
And Captain Obvious
Some people needed it a lot *cough*
4CAPTAIN PLANET...HE'S A HERO!
4that show is so retardedly awesome
4though now that I think back, not awesome
4hey...
2Gonna take pollution down to zero.
4what happened to Kazoobie?
She left ):
4what happened?
/me sits in a corner and sulks
She didn't approve of how the forum was being run
Or something
4ah
/me 4has a comment but will keep to self
PM? :P
4no
Aww
Fine
4but this place does seem empty
4All of the old, good, members left
Yeah...
2Makes room for new members :P
4Yeah
4but 90% of them are retards
DDR wouldn't even come back if the internet was unblocked at home
He said he got bored of it
4lol
4well there is like nothin going on
yeah
And neither of us really care about Spyro anymore
4yeah
I like IRC though
4Though I say Spyro the other day
4saw*
Especially this server
All the other servers I've been on are too crowded
4heh
And I don't know anyone ):
Pretty much the opposite of this place
I know everyone and it's dead
4aye
4the Spyro fandom is out of hand
4and the older members are loosing interest
yep
small victory though
4oh?
I randomly ran into someone on Neo the other day who was a fan of the old games
4ah
Said he lost interest after the PS2 ones started coming out
2Sounds like me. :P
4LoS got me back into the series
We had a long talk over PMs about Year of the Dragon
4but then after DotD...fuck the game series and fuck the fans of LoS
4Even though it is a kid's game
4there should be some maturity in them
That reminds me of this thread on the forum today
4Immaturity?
Someone was saying LoS wasn't immature enough
4yeah I just off of that thread
And everyone took it the wrong way
They were all like
"Talking purple dragons aren't immature!"
As if that was the point of the thread at all... >_>
4lol
2lmao
2Talking purple dragons are my favorite kind of dragon :P
4shows that 90% of the fans have the IQ of 1
wtf
Meow
Use your SF username please
Hai :D
He's an old member
I invited him here
You mean this one?
ah
ok
+N is set
nice going
/me hisses
Yeah sorry
:P
MATT LAUER CAN S UCK IT
I like +N
Of course you do
You're an op :P
4eh?
2Land of the Lost YES.
:)
:D
/me works on Radical Dreamers: Le Tresor Interdit and RD: The Girl who could only sing
In old Avalar, there is a story after the war was one
Haha
2haha
I don't have +N in my channel... :P
or m ine
that in the guise of the N'webo, the last of the Principal's was taken down
~ Radical Dreamers: The Unstealable Jewel 2.0% complete
4y'know, browsing through ff.net....I want to slit my writs
4wrists*
lol
2I haven't been there in YEARS.
I don't usually go there
haven't been in months
2It was pretty bad when I was active there, back in like 2003.
its populated by NTs
2 2001-2003
4Red, Scar says she is gonna abandon her account and fuck Spyro lol
haha
I don't blame her
4I don't blam eher
I wrote this song
I'm going to marry spyro
wow
2haha
2no me first :P
and I"m a guy, he was a balloon
Those meds do you in good
Now I'm up to worse things
like telling the ORIGINAL story of the Radical Dreamers, based on Anti-NT fairytales instead of Squaresoft/Squarepenis's misunderstood videogame
I can only imagine
4wow
4fuck that
lol
2lmfao
figures
filth
Normal people and their oddities
'Ayin, wayshower
Yaoi?
I"ve been a mod before LOL
.__.
I was going to create my own network called Atlantis at some point, I learnt the tricks ot hte trade fromp eople who now hate my behind
@_@
Did he like it?
I don't nkow yet, after all the crap he gave that series, I"d be too hesitant to believe him a convert
although, I don't believe much of anyone to begin with, you should know that about me by now
:D
so, what are you guyss up to , sorry for babbling so much
Blueflame invited me here, so I'm here
I wont' be sticking about for long
I actually have things that mean something to me to get done
:D
and it doesen't have anything to do with getting somewhere in life, or making a living or getting degrees or gettin better
:)
2Im just watching some TV.
2Not wanting to go to class tomorrow.
..no one doese, no one doese, it sthe same bullshit every year, unless you're in college that is
2I am. :P
Mandatory grade school/grammar school only needs to teach people the basics
that's all wbe need
2That's why I say "class" not "school", hehe.
We're not in the industrial age anymore
2Just a lot of busy work that I feel swamped by, but to some extent I was looking forward to the new semester because I coudl use something to keep me busy.
Yeah, they programme your brain to overowrk so it always needs something to stimulate it
2Idle time just leads me to getting depressed a lot so I try to keep busy. That's all.
/me doesnt' believe that's a personality issue
it happened to me as well
just in a more extreme fashion
2Well, I dont really want to talk about it... usually doesn't help my case any.
Oh, sorry
2Its ok
/me wonders how in the hell its going to pull off the Shootout sequences in RD II: The Girl who could only sing
Lack of sleep makes you depressed.
So does lack of sunlight.
2I sleep a lot. Or I try to.
2And I avoid the sun since I burn too easily. :P
ouch
:(
I don't get as much sleep as I should.
I think I Do
But meh, as you said, if you have something to do you don't notice it.
I actually conditioned myself into sleeping 6 hours
2I slept 11 hours last night.
I had to in order to pull off the first Remake of Radical Dreamers
I slept 3 hours, lol.
2Most days I have class I sleep about 4 to 8 hours though, but today is Labor Day so there wasn't class.
I had to do it behind the group home and my social workers back
It worked, until the drive died from being hit by lightening
but it worked :)
2Keeping busy by writing, drawing, or working on a project doesn't let me notice the things about me that make me down.
/me enjoyed 2005-2006 for that reason and t hat reason alone, even though it got an award for what it contributed to "Wonderful Young Adults" and its teacher started to understand metaphor better
I take it more as an act of standing up for my right of free expression
2Writing?
Game design
2ah
there is more then one way to tell a good faerytale
:)
especially an anti-NT one, where the villians are Teachers
and Head-teachers
2What does NT mean, exactly?
Neurotypical or "Normal"
2ah
Its a term that fellow Autistics created as a retort to being labeled
although, they're totally missing the point, but that's beside the point, Meow
I still use the term NT, however, I t hink it's funny
2Kinda like "mundane" to the furry community. :P
2I like all of those funny terms.
"Furry"...dont' they realize they're merely identifying with the hybrid offpring of the Alvi X animal experiments
Mundane is a label also used at Sci-Fi conventions to denote again, normal people
2I dunno, furry's not my thing. I just have a bunch of friends who are into that kinda stuff though.
/me hotest hat the cheetah people in spyro are a really close replication of the B'tani, but for the love of god, get the accent right you stupid realists
notes*
/me DLs RPG Maker XP and grins
/me yawns
I agree
2So, I chatted with SR last night :P
2That was interesting :P
chatting with SR is the most interesting thing you can do here
2Yea
2He was pulling my chains and I didnt get the joke, so I looked like a retard.
2;_;
I think Janus_Zeal is surge168 or something
I forgot his full name
If you find out its that serge guy, be sure to ban.
2No idea, never met the guy. :P
he was banned years ago.
2Also hello
hey, sup.
lol
2Not a whole lot, being lazy :P
wow im right?
Im like, phycic or something
Bans will be had.
you know how I knew?
ummmmm
His "NT" phrase thing.
I remember that from when I used to talk to him.
ah
well you want him banned or what
2Yea I had to ask him what the hell that was. :P
If he comes back, ban.
okies
I dont want him around.
yeah I thought he was a little fucked up
He is.
Very much so.
The less you talk to him the better.
I didn't talk to him lol
2haha he must be fucked up if I can chill out but he cant :P
Anyways, if he asks why, say bad evading.
ban*
Because hes technically still banned
Why would she ever do that./
She knows very well hes banned.
idk
she prolly thought it didn't matter anymore
I always remember bans.
well make sure you tell her that
she prolly didn't think it mattered
hahaha
im such an idiot
"Serge_c2000@cloak-72338786.mpls.qwest.net"
it says his name right in his hostmask
*doh*
2There you go with that crazy IP stuff :P
I thought you noticed that lol
I was gonna say "Cause his name is in the IP?"
4eh?
4what I miss?
4on Scar's forum?
Idk
you see her Journal on dA?
4yeah
was all like
Remember my friend Spyrogirl who died, she lives!!!
I was like.......huh?
2...
2What.
4she was one of the founding members of her forum then she disappeared, then her sister logged on and said she died in a car crash
4and then she popped on today saying her sister fucked everythign up and she was alive
2Oh, geez.
2So was it an attention ploy or something?
4I have no fucking clue
4pancakes? rambo mode!
:O
/me poke pokes pokes K
:D
You has fb?
Time to head off to home
Laters all
9Active?
Not really
Missed it by a couple hours
=P
9Who was on then?
Were on
And no, actually
I wasn't really late
XD
lol
9I can invite Aiicebo onmaybe
Turns out I didn't have to be there until 4:30
nice
So I get there and told the manager sorry I'm late
And she just looked at me like o__O
where you working?
hahah
School cafeteria
It's hotter than hell in there D:
I bet
?
Eh, oh well
You guys banned Serge then?
Sorry for letting him in here
He contacted me on MSN and asked me what IRC channel I was on and I couldn't think of anything to tell him
yup
He's kind of annoying
Sort of like Doppel
I'm nice to him and he starts considering me like a great friend or something
I don't know how to get rid of people like that without being mean
lol
I know how :P
It's not funny ):
aw
well I'm nice to someone too
unless I know they're screwed up
then I kinda have to tell the truth
o.o
I feel bad for letting him in now but also that he's going to be sad now that he's banned
Blarg
eh
just tell him it was by order of
SR
Yeah but I don't really even want to talk to him at all
But I can't tell him to go away either because he's always like
You're such a great friend, you're the only one that's ever accepted me, blah blah
yeah yeah
D;
well just ignore him and only say what you have to
Yeah...
sorry if I'm not much help
He doesn't make any sense half the time either
As you probably notice
*noticed
yah
Looking back, I probably shouldn't have said anything about IRC
I didn't think he'd actually want to join .__.
I was trying to make up an excuse to not talk to him honestly
ot
"it's ok"
you still around?
Yes
Oh OK
dont worry about serge
surge*
I dont want him around here
he was previously banned
anyways
this is what the grade 11 web dev course looks like... http://pastie.org/private/h641seje4usmq37uftrjtw
4what?
7I dunno. It's generally accepted that you're a bitch though.
4oh?
4when did that come in?
7yeah
7people receive the news five minutes into their first conversation with you :P
4that's mostly becuase I hate people and I really don't care what I say/their reaction
7^ = bitch. :P
4lol
7she wants to declare her love for you!
2No, I wanted to ask if he could find me something :/
2Hello Abbery
2Â¬Â¬
14Hi DB!!!!!!!!!!!
7Stacey: a map because you get lost in his eyes?
4indeed it is
2Wtf I dont like Dari in that way TYVM.
7'that' way could be construed as anything.
4pwned
14LOL
2'That' being in love with him, you moron
7'love' is also a matter of opinion. Your love for him could never be described by words.
2Anyone home?!
4it proves your point
7she wants to know if another webcam cyber is ok.
6Hai DB and Abbey *hugs_both*
2Like the difference between my love for coffee ice cream and mah love for a person
2Hello C7 :3
2"What wrong with us?"
2FIAL
4point?
7Nothing you say can be trusted.
4but 90% of the time I am RIGHT
4and you know it
2Who's 'you'? :3
/me 14glomps C7
7well. You appear to have fallen in the 10%.
14:3
6=D
/me 2lolz.
4Don't piss me off
14o-o
7and Stacey's just Stacey. She's fucked in the head SO many ways, she actually trusts me to keep a secret.
14SPILL!
2Bah, it's not like nobody's heard of it befooooore
/me 2headdesks
/me 2runs away
7...
7why are most people in here so stupid?
/me 2runs pretty damn fast
7It physically hurts.
2We don't think like you, dear, noticed that yet?
4becuase your brain cannot comprehend the awesomeness
2YO' ORANGE MAKES MAH EYES BLEED, BRO.
2Score! 2nd ignored comment of the day!
2-_-
6o.o
7Lol.
2Triplets? Shut up XD
4Lesbian?
7I ignore your comments because you fail, Stacey.
2So what?
6lol
7Now, if only they were ALL RELATED. That would be a plot twist worthy of daytime TV.
6OH YA
/me 6opens LW
2...
4...So your saying you like lesbian incest?
6Aw
6I'm not feeling tired naymore! D:
7No. It'd just be a big plot twist.
14._.
14HE LIKES IT
6*anymore
2That'd make me not watch TV anymore. I hardly watch it anyways, apart from the occasional Friends/Scrubs/Jackass.
7whoo! Friends/Scrubs!
2...
4I hate Friends but I love Scrubs
7there's gunna be a ninth season of Scrubs. No JD and Carla's gunna only be a guest star.
6lol
6I just love Friends
2Wow, first time you haven't tried to kill anything I just said.
/me 2high-fives C7
7apparently Carla's gunna stay at home with the kids, which completely over-rides an entire story arch about her loving her work.
6Ugh
6My friend's gonna go all sad again..D:
/me 7goes back to assembling his post for ANS.
2:/
7C7: pesky emotions eh?
7Facetiousness is fun.
14...
6Meh..
6I half can't blame her but still../half/ can't
2...
6Anyways
7AND,
7whatever RDX is.
2Crazy bitch? How dare you!
6UGH
14HEY
6STOP DOING THAT STUPID WMP
14IM NOT A DOG
2:3
14DB, he has none.
6Why am I a complainer? D:
2LULZ
7I wouldn't. Balls of steel 'n' all that.
14We've discussed this before.
2Balls of steel mah foot.
7That's the sequence of events of you kicking me, yes.
6Whatebur
7C7: it's rather self-explanatory. You complain. A lot.
6Crap
14So do YOU!
2Installing crap, brb
7Abbey: Yes, but that trait is over-ridden by my assholeitude.
6I do?
7yep.
7You complain about everything. Your friends, school, not being at school, the heat in your room, boredom, not being able to sleep, your odd disease where you can only sleep when you draw...
7just as a quicklist.
6Ok..
14._.
7it would work as a TV show.
6I also complain about it not raining btw
7ah yes.
7that too.
6:P
7and not being able to make AMVs.
7are we done here? Because I still need to make my post.
6Ya.Though I can't be bothered to make any anyway so I shut up about that
6I guess
7good. I didn't care about the responses, but a positive one is always a time-saver.
14-.-
6YAYZ
6MORE SHINIZZLE FANS
/me 14yells "Hypocrite" and runs away
7that's just odd. *cuts abbey's achilles tendons*

6Wb
7why am I a hypocrite?
/me 14glomps DB
14-.-
14Must I tell you why, AGAIN.
7Oh yeah Stacey, you'd be the TV show's resident bi to ward off lawsuits.
7Yes.
2Hello again.
2ORLY.
7YARLY.
2Wrong!
7they should put the 'L' key next to 'G', so when Stacey says 'ORLY' she sometimes typos it into 'ORGY'
2I'm the crazy bitch apparently :)
7Yes. ALSO the resident bi.
6lol
14._.
7SHE DOES.
7XD
14......
2AW DARN.
2Isnt that nice?
7I demand you provide evidence she doesn't Abbey!
2I found some A7x on the guitar guru shizzle :3
7Great. She still keeps getting in with the pedos.
6Shinizzle! =D
2She doesn't get in with any pedos o.o
14I WASN'T!
7Good for you Abbey. Now shoo.

14Nakuto came here....
14WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
7... I know there's a guy on SF called Nakuto, EXPLAIN.
14Under a rock?
6Or did he do something with RD12
7It was... ummm... I forget. ><
14LOL
6Same
7AntR who was RD12
6Ya

14In the sky?
14What kind of screwed perception do you have there?
14x.x
2i.e. I am an atheist -_-
14But the sky.....

14Internet Explorer: I am an atheist :B
6XD

6Woo
7I see. You refuse to respond. I do believe in here-a Texas, we calls that a win by dee-fault.
6I still have the bruised mosquito bite :)
2... t('o't)
14KJ: Hypocrite
14LOL DB
7Abbey: will you fuck off.
2YAY I found some happies.
14No I won't.
14I'm not that screwed in the head to 'fuck' off.
6lol
7Stop twisting words, it's really annoying. I'd say everyone else finds it annoying but at the moment most people aren't well disposed towards me and would jump to your defence regardless of personal opinion (because the low brain power of SF just isn't that good) so it's rather quit pointless.
2Excuse my ramblings
7quite*
14lol
6I wish my effing parents would AT LEAST make their stupid cigarrets somewhere that's NOT over the keyboard.. D<
2o.O
2Lulz, when I was hoovering the front room once I came across a bag of my dad's ... smoking shizzle <_>
6The 2 and s don't work well again because the shit's going un the key!
2O_O
6AMG I WROTE A STUPID REPLY TO PHOENIX
2ORLY.
6And I htg soon...D:
7Stacey: The evidence is in my favour, as it usually is. All involved know it, even if some don't wish to admit it. Even if you don't acknowledge it, I won the pointless argument you started.
2Go do your homework.
7No-one gives out homework on the first day
2They might.
6DB: You has a Twitter right?
2C7 wtf are you stalking me? O_O
6Lol no
7You prove my points time and again. Your fail pile is growing exponentially.
6Can I stalk you on there then? O_O
2Hm. Maybe.
7And now you ignore me. The predictability of humans is SO fun.
6ok
14huh?
/me 7looks around.
7Me?

Watch your language.

2Gtg, goodbye.
6Hey
Hi
Umm
7yes.
Heh
6 16 I think
7RDX concurs.
Lol
She doesn't like him then
So what's the problem?
=P
7It's surprisingly hard to roll a bouncy ball between a 360 controller and a pencil case at close range.
7I'm not sure whether she does or not, it's just her training taught her to take advantage of the situation.
7SILENCE OF DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
6o.o
9Only?
6Hai =D
7Yeah.
7You're not worth killing.
9Aww
7unless you have the price of a bullet on you.
9Let me check
6lolus
7how much is a bullet by the way?
9No idea
7ah. How much do you have on you?
Hello world, and all who abuse it.
7Hello, Father of Thyme.
Never have I ever fathered Thyme.
6o.o
Argh.
7ah. I'm not sure, was it you or Mussolini who made the trains run on thyme?
That guy with the crab limb.
7I hate him.
7let's kill him.
Oh yeah, Larry King did it. It's so clear now.
7we need to put him in a corridor where he can't turn around, get a crane thing and turn him so he's facing forwards. He can only move sideways.
Welcome back.
6WB
Haven't seen you in a while.
You started school, right?
/me 7sings the circus 'dun dun dun danananananana' tune but replacing all the sounds with 'nom'
9On Wednesday I am
Oh, lucky you. :P
I started like two weeks ago, which by CT's standards is pretty early.
7AAAH
7KILL IT
/me dies
I sure didn't notice...
7we can say homosapien without being banned for a week.
I did sense some sort of fluctuation there.
;)
/me wants ops D:
/me also wants a sammich
o.o
Did she really lose it though?
The op, I mean?
7she did.
7oh.
7I dunno.
9 888chan?
XD
lolwut
He called her a human?
7it was funny.
How dare that guy.
7she now denies it of course.
9...XD
I can sort of see her doing that though
I remember that fondly.
I was there, dude.
:P
7oh.
7lol.
She was here for a visit like a week ago
I can't remember if she had op or not though
I honesly didn't know she officially left.
7Remember when she flipped out because she thought we were talking to her.
But she's been on Facebook like 24/7 so it fits.
9'Human' CAN be insulting, with some examples there are
9That's stylish.
/me only had a month of summer. Sad face.
I talk to her on gmail sometimes
7I had nine weeks. *wins forever*
She said she doesn't come because she's busy with making videos and stuff =/
My work was so difficult that it took me longer than most.
9Oh.
And I do pretty well in school, so I'm not lying.
9My summer dragged on
7I slept through most of my summer.
yeah
My summer slept through most of me.
I think only you were there though
:P
I dunno
Yeah.
4lol?
7 888chan got EVERYTHING on her, and they didn't even notice my facebook, and their life ruination tactics would be brilliant against her. Especially tampons, garage sale, prostitutes and yellow pages.
But I learned at my high school that the Algebra one I did last year was their equivalent of Algebra II, haha.
7Oooh. Someone's a show-offy prick.
No, I'm saying I failed miserably.
9Again, 88chan?
You're missing what I'm saying.
XD
9Lol.
I never passed the damn thing.
7No.
9Oh.
7I never said they were brilliant.
7I said they had inspirtational moments.
4lies
7Their tactics have been acumulated through the vast majority of semi-intelligent channers.
I still had a few lessons to do by the cutoff date, so the entire year was a waste.
:/
9Sucks.
Yeah.
7of what?
Of how the point stands.
9So eighth grade math is hell?
7You're show-offing your fails to get pity. Or something.
=/
Are you in eigth?
I'm a sophomore.
9Yeah, going into
/me is a Senior~
I'm not sure, it was okay for me. Not too hard.
Calculus is awesome :3
/me 9feels young
/me has no moar high school :D
^ The point stands
Lol.
Yeah
10 times better than high school
XD
lol
9Except for the dried up vomit on the sidewalks on the way to class?
He's just trying to troll as usual
I've been to college, lol. In one.
Ignoring it would be the most reasonable course of action
Reasonable, but boring.
Fair enough :P
:P
More like "I don't have any proof so I give up"
9You don't have a warrant!
Precisely.
He focuses more on jabs than proof.
In which case, I have a defense clause.
Hehehe.
7Nah. I'm trading 'O RLY' 'YA RLY' 'NO WAI' 'WAI' pictures with someone on a cbox.
What happened?
7she died?
7yay!
9She isn't very happy...?
7oh.
7tell me something new pl0x.
Lemme check.
7sure it is.
7if you're just that funny in the head
7LET ME FINISH
7D:
7meanie.
What did I do? D:
/me 7provides amazing defence and counter-sues for deformation of character.
*dissimilar
It's not your business. :P
7I'd look, but I don't know my FB password.
You're talking about her Facebook page?
4what happened now?
She's always writing stuff like that
4and I have no idea how to work Facebook
Then I talk to her and she seems perfectly happy
4not that I ever tried
7"emotionally stabbed in the heart"
7whiny cow.
/me wonders if he has ever seen an emotionally-pointy object.
/me 7dodges kick.
9XD
:P Don't worry, I never say that.
Rips?
You mean ribs?
7... yes.
7XD
/me forgot to mention that he shot a water-propelled rocket last night.
7http://www.comixed.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/128957117238749906.jpg
It went about one fifty feet in the air.
6Wtf is with you people saying shizzle all the time? And what does it mean? >.<
Sure.
Snoop Dog decided it was a word. XD
6Lol
o.o
6Wb again
The villain, of course.
9Child asks if she was okay last time
Um, sure?
Besides of the vrocking and vrolling.
Hm.
Dareh
9Hey Dari.
Hey.
7and C7 is the complainer. Dari, is, of course, the geek.
Keeps her at the top of her game. ;)
4hehe ED did an article for Spyro
9She said "I couldn't help myself from vrocking.*giggle*"
Who's Nakuto?
BRB
(gas)
4huh?
7you're autistic. That counts.
Wait, Dari's not the geek.
4rite...
9Who's autistic?
9No, I meant that you said 'obligatory bi'
Maybe he meant biploar. Who knows?
:P
Or tripolar, if we're coutning Sick Puppies.
9I know, but how do you think she'll take it?
6o.o
Take what, exactly?
7The conversation is long and rambling.
7*shot*
I'm not sure, but does it matter?
Her definiteion of intolerance is a little off-base, don't you think?
7...
7I EXPLAINED.
*definition
7><
Back.
Mhm.
And what I said above.
9Yeah, I know.
4I remember that
I don't.
4funny as hell
Funny how three of us recall but the victim doesn't.
9How would YOU like it if you were called 'human'?
4I...would be proud
homosapien != human.
You know, I stopped doing Word of the Day a while ago...
4becuase then I can say I am normal
That sucks.
4and not 'FU I'M A DRAGON!' BS
Well, if you take the Latin to be literal anyway.
FU, from the Latin based "BS".
9That's BS.
Nah, FU.
9FU you piece of BS!
Latin based!
;)
Meh, bored.
Meh, dead.
9Meh, angstcrappy.
Meh, shankoptamus.
*shankopotamus
9Meh, spankopita.
What kind of kid thinks taco should be captialized?
=/
6Spanakopita!?
7a stupid one?
Well, obvious answers aside.
It was also rhetorical. :P
A Facebook child.
9Oh.
9Well maybe that's a name.
"In the mood 4 a Taco."

*I'm
Hey.
Soup to you too.
*my
9...Why ae they there, if you don't mind me asking?
Haha. Long story.
9*are
But since I've obviously mentioned it for a reason I'll tell you.
:P
So there's this Grim Reaper mask that my friend has, and he brought it over for some scare-age, I guess, like four months ago. As we were attaching this tub that would make blood spurt out of the neck of the mask/costume,he squeezed it too hard and the realistic-looking blood splattered all over my room.
9Oh, well that's relieving, lol.
13Hai
Oh, now do you want the real answer?
Just kidding.
Oh, hey.
:)
13what
The I think part of the baby I just ate got stuck in my throat. :/
13Dari: CAN I HAVE THE SOULS!?
^ Damn, that happens occassionally. Use the plunger.
That had to be at least 10 seconds.
How long?
I liked the new recipe, but it needs more blood to help it slide down easily
9*allergies
Awkward silence win.
/me raises his five-sided fistagon.
:P
That's sounds...Nasty.
"Fistagon". O_o
Not really...
9Epic fail: http://fanfiction.net/1837471/1/Phoenix's_Life
Why does everyone appear to be on FF.net today?
13k now I'm bored
6o.o
6Gtg
9I saw it before
6Bai people
13ho hum.
I'm breaking under the strain of pleasing the masses. I'm the dying pacifist. :P
13Good for you chap
/me wiggles o3o
Didn't notice you were here
13*squeeeeeze*

13K then.
Lol no

Haha
13I wanna seeeee
13D:
I could be risking my life if they turn out to be rabid Twitards
:P
13Nah
13bored...
9Yesterday, a pamphlet was left on the porch...and it was...was...was...
13A CATHOLIC PAMPLET?
9"Church at the movies!"
13I was close...
9Yup.
9We already got at least four other religious pamphlets
I'mma go look for some yarn
13These old people drove from like Oregon just to attempt giving my family info on the bible
9Fail.
/me 9is anxious
13for what
9My dad expects me to spill out my feelings
13wtf
You'd think he'd hate if you did.
9no...?
I mean, knowing my dad he hates it when my sisters get all "emotional."
9Same here usually...
Exactly, I never said it would work the same here, I'm just saying "You'd think". Read my words next time. :P
13Screw off.
9Fail.
=/ Wow
Is it just me, or did she just overreact and make up an insult simultaneously?
9It's just you...she just bitched.
/me yawns
It happens to the some of us.
Lol.
that was hard
what else is new? -.-
^ Hahaha
just amazes me how easily she gets offended
Nothing really offends me anymore
I've been on the internet too long for that
you shouldn't care
9Wangst fucking fails.
*even
nah that time she was just mad cause she misread something and you pointed it out lol
so you pointed out the stupidity she doesn't think she has now and then :P
Now I don't get to say "DO UR CHOREZ".
9Nice.
One time she replied with "DO UR CRAPZ". Let's just say I lol'd.
9I would've too.
9Look on MM.
I'm on my way.
Be careful what you say, you might give yourself away. Chances are you won't live past tomorroooooow.
9Lol.
Really? How so? Haha.
9*facepalm*
9She's pissed off over nothing and is accusing me.
9*facepalms the world*
I put an articulate post up in m defense, but I'm dropping it.
It's in the Me VS Myself one.
*my
9I saw.
The one I wrote a minute ago?
9Yeah.
:/ She's gonna hate me for this.
9If she has any ounce of maturity, then no.
I don't mean to offend, but she's gotten pissed over less convicting things.
9Though your post is thorough
I guess.
There was so much I edited out.
9Like?
A lot about her pulling complaints and all that out of her ass, and about her definition of intolerance.
9Oh...well that's about right.
If necessary I'll add it, if she ever even replies.
9Do you think that she'll ban us?
Nah, then she'd be comepletely alone, which doesn't appear to be what she wants.
And the only reason I'd be sad about that is because I won't be able to read her retort.
If anyone gets banned it'll be me, because you were neutral.
9She already thinks that she's alone
9And multiple browsers?
Us three are the only ones who go there.
Speaking of which, do the people on OFF know she's a girl yet? Haha.
9I know that- I meant multiple browsers as in Firefox and IE, which you can use to see the message
9And I think so
No, because she hid all the forums except for like the Intro one to non-users.
9Oh yeah.
I sort of always knew it'd boil down to this, two on one.
But then everyone's had the same position she's in now.
Me summer of '08, you Fall of '08, and now her.
9Late bloomer.
Well said.
I'm not on MM, anything happen?
I'll assume no.
Welcome back.
9Damn Firefox.
9So...
So, how's life?
9....Moving on....
Haha.
9Yes.
9What did you do to my fort?!

Cooties, most likely.

2u never heard of cooties?
It's a word for when younger, physically immature kids find the opposite sex unappealing.
A fictional disease.
2lmao i havent heard that since elemetary school
...Couldn't there be a better name for it?
2nope..... little kids say this so i gess parents let them cuse it makes them seem cute i assume
"Cooties" just sounds so...(Can't think of a word to describe it)
It sounds kiddish, which is why it comes from little kids.
:P
2farfetched and fictional/childish?
I dunno. I just don't like the way it sounds.
2X3 i used to think the same
I'm almost positive I remember being like six years old, and the teacher asked us if we were going to get married one day, and all of the other kids were like "Eww, no!" and I was like "Um, not really, but I know I will when I'm older." XD
2lol
2and back when i was that young, there seemed like no war, no nothing
2except the one day when Columbine highschool had its shooting V_V
2have any of you heard about that?
Yeah.
:[
2V_V i was less then a mile away when that happened
Wait, how older are you? That happened like the year I was born.

Mainly because it's a school.
Good for you, or good enough for you?
Good for me, as in I dislike school.
But I'm not in the minority for that, lol.
If it's not good for you, it generally implies that it's bad for you. :P
2yea school bores me...... even that obama speech today
I just proved it - school is bad for your health.
2XD
:P

2but yea, they changed the cola to some health crap, the venders no longer has decent munchins *still got gummy worms tho scary*
2yea normal i get up to late for breakfast so i dont eat, and lunch doesnt have any decent munchies any more either, so i just hang with my friends and play cards rest of lunch

Any new dents in your car?
10Quite a memory you have. lol no, no new dents
So just the one, or did you have that removed?
10had it removed, mostly. There's obviously still a small dent in it, but it isnt noticable. Still have the scratches though
Apparenlt you can get rid of dents by heating them with a hairdryer for a few minutes, then spraying them with liquid CO2, although it won't work on curves.
Apparently*
10My dad used to work on cars, he fixed the bits that could be fixed. You cant fix creases in the metal and thats all thats left
I dunno, there's a video showing someone do it, and I don't see how it can have been edited.
doing*
10It may have fixed a dent, but not a crease, my dent was a severe one and actually warped the metal, not just pushed it in
Oh.
I wonder where everyone went.

13what happened to your old one
I've actually gotten a bit better
Depression, usually from lack of sleep/sunlight.
Pfffft
13and I know how you feel
Fuck him, He's in like, the netherlands or something now
13aww
Either way
So...You got dumped?
He was a slut
Hell no
He did
sorakiri: Yes it is.
Fair enough.
Yes, when I have a lack of sleep/sunlight.
13which is ALWAYS
13HURRHURR
Lol.
I don't feel it if I'm doing something.
Like talking now.
sorakiri: Look it up.
3nothin there
Sunlight gives you vitman D ( I think it's D) and a lack of it makes you depressed.
It's proven, so don't bother arguing.
:)
13lol
3depressed is when your sad ****er
10I'll agree with Dari
*you're
13You can get depression in many different ways.
13(@sorakiri)
I got depressed for standing on my head
*from
3im always depressed
But then I realized it was probably just dizziness
3my life died 2 years ago
LOLEMO
Most people don't have an actual reason to be depressed, like me.
It's just lack of sleep and sunlight, as I said. :o
3are you ****ing kidding me
3you have no ****ing idea of how i feel
He never said he did
also
exactly.
/me beats sorakiri with *'s
3he said its from lack of sunlight
13What happened, couldn't buy the latest Linking Park album?
I was saying in my case it's a lack of sleep/sunlight, so no need to get all riled.
So why are you depressed anyway?
13Don't hurt WYFT *stabbity rib stab stab*
3my life died 2 years ago
/me respawns with a flamethrower
Why did your life die 2 years ago?
SPYCHECK
13well you don't seem dead.
/me burns sorakiri
nope
Not a spy
/me 10smashes his head on the wall until the mental pain goes away
3well the love of my life dumped me
How old are you btw?
13I'm depressed because I have an alcoholic father that threatens to burn the house down while my mom is getting divorce things ready
3 11
13LOL

LOL
10lol
And you say two years ago?
Dear lord
You have no idea
NO idea
10you have nothing to be depressed about
3assholes
/me falls over laughing
Wow, kids these days.
/raegquit
13I have a crush but I wouldn't call anyone the "love of my life" anytime soon
10lol
13Agreed
I love talking about kids as though I'm not one. XD
13even though I am a kid
13Agreed again
10im not a kid :P
13YES YOU AREEEE

Really? I never would have guessed. :O
13hmm
13GOODLUCKEVERYBODEHELSEEE
10so who else is depressed :P
I am
But I don't care
Why is it that people think they know what love is from the age of 7 now? I reckon I don't really understand it yet, lol.
I'm always depressed when I'm sitting at home alone
I understand it better than some, but I'm not that wise in it either
Lol.
10I dont understand it and I'm bleeding 18. There's no way an ii year old can understand it
10 11*

Re~

DEAR GOD GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD
im still depressed by the way:(
13my old music teacher in school used to think that saying random sounds such as "so" "me" "do" and "tikitikitata" while slapping your stomache was making music
10no you arent
yes i am
10not
shut up or ill kill you
My music teacher had us do some "Musical winetasting"
10pfft
He's weird.
10kill me with what?
my knife
or my axe
or my power saw
10lawl you funny
10very funny
i know where you live
sorakiri: Try hitting him through your computer monitor then.
I'm sure it will work.
13Where does he live, then?
10where do I live
i can find where you live
10How
10and then do it
just gotta hack you moniter
lol
13LOL
You can't hack a moniter
or monitor for that matter
10he's a moron
When Doppel tried to "jam my router" nothing happened.
It was funny.
13Good luck, ClubPenguinChampion
computer whatever
i can still find where you live
10You're a child
so
10And then what will you do with your feeble mind?
13He must be emo.
there have been child hackers
Yeah
I know 8
You're not one of them :D
well my feeble mind can brake into your house and kill you in your sleep
*break
13LOL
10lol now you're making me giggle
13I'm already laughing.
10giggle....such a funny word
He's going to send you a ping, then chase it accross the world till it reaches you.
dont doubt me dude
10Let him do that, he cant do anything worse
oh i can
10apparently I learnt what a dude is
13TOTALLY DUUUUDE
13COWABUNGA
:D
13PIZZA MAN
13><
13*nogalstic*
i can torture the **** out of you dude
Cowabunga made me with ganja. Weird thought connections.
what's with the ***
me think*
10Sure you can, sure you can
********** you in the ****
you ****er
****!
13******
Son of a cheesebaker.
13LLOL
i will skin you alive dip you in lemon juice then burn you
My word, those stars are making me awful hot :D
13why?
/me scampers about
10can you dip me in lime juice instead?
13Because someone isn't going with what you're saying?
13You'll never get through life like that
I'm sure he'll grow up...Eventually.
13good luck with that
13LOL
LOL
10after all, they're associated with each other so much
lemon juice really hurts if you have a huge wound
10so does lime, I really prefer green to yellow you see
13actually it's a proven fact that it helps the wound heal
Lemon juice taste nice.
go with it
10so can it be lime juice?
it heals but it hurts
13Nope.
13I did it myself
13Tore my skin open riding my bike
10I take it I can have lime juice then?
13it doesn't hurt
still hurts
13Doesn't hurt.
10salt hurts, you should try salt
ok then ill use stomach acid on his hand
13Good luck with that
it will definatly hurt
10I also recently learnt that bacon juice stings a wound too
10you could just use hydrochloric acid, easier to find than Stomach acid
I got branded by a hot lighter, lawl. BRB.
13he's probably copy and pasting "hydrochloric"
or i can strap his arm to a hot iron
13Why?
10dropped a hot iron on my foot once, burnt the carpet lol
13Why are you threatening to do things that you'll never do, anyways?
it will burn his arm really badly
13Why are you threatening to do things that you'll never do, anyways?
ive done them before
dont doubt me do
13Answer me.
10Listen kid, you're a retard, go play with your toys and stop trying to scare me, you're no where near intelligent enough to do that
im 11 you shithead
13So?
10yeah, hence why I called you kid
Lol
An 11 year old would get caught if they did something like that, they'd leave way too much forensic evidence behind. Yeah you might want to google that kid.
13Yeah kid
10The kid couldnt over power me anyway to get caught
ill wear gloves wash the weapons bury the body in the bottom of the lake
10lol there's no lake anywhere near me, kid
i dont need to overpower you
13LOL
13You don't even know what half these words mean I bet
i can just slit your throat
sorakiri: you need to find him first
13How will you find him?
10I bet you arent tall enough to slit my throat
5 feet tal
*tall
LOL
13How will you find him?
Couldn't touch my throat XD
10Ha ha ha, my bed's taller than that, you wont be able to reach :P
How tall?
how tall are you dude
13DUUDE
13DUDE MAN DUDE
10 6ft 2
SWEEET
13RADICAL
GNARLY
are you fucking kidding me
dude my arms are long and ill be holding a knife
dude
10And? You're a dwarf
Get a fucking clue
READ A BOOK
13How will you leave without your parents knowing?
It's hard to get a knife
for one
it's hard to slit someone's throat
for one my dad has one
10he probably cant reach the lock on his door
just take the knife and slice it
10everyone has a knife, I have several in my kitchen
13sorakiri: How will you find him without your parents knowing?
exactly
I have like, 18 knives
10if I include table knives, I have about 30 lol
i have my own laptop
10so do i
they never go on it
sorakiri: I have TWO laptops
13If you do that, your parents won't let you watch family guy or play Grand Theft Auto anymore.
i have my ways
13sora: how will you GO and find him without your parents knowing, along with killing someone?
10the ways of th egnomes
10gnomes*
None of which will work.
dude!!!
gnomes are freaking way shorter than me
Lol, this kid is a laugh.
dwarves are smaller
13Life is more than a 2D Spyro's Lair game.
10Like you're totally a gnome, dude
fuck you shithead
13Gnomeboy
10Be quite gnome
13Why would I do that/
assholes
10The gnomish people will come to collect you
T_T
13hm
dude gnomes are about 3 feet
im 5 feet
I think he's throwing a tantrum.
10You're dad's a gnome
13You're the only gnome in the world, though.
13How would you know?
13Heads aren't made of shit.
Wow, a real insult is witty.
yours is
10Age isnt a sign of maturity, you're 5 as far as I'm concerned
That's just mindless swearing any idiot can do.
13No, it's made of skin and bones.
well thats me but you the one with shit for brains
13Nope, I have a real brain.
i doubt that
13no one has odorless crap.
13My head doesn't smell
10I like the way he loses focus and switches his insults to different people. It amuses me
Only someone with rocks for brains would think one of us has shit for brains. :)
13Freshie: yep.
how old are you
10How old am I?
1326.
13loooool
About...3x you age.

10lol how can age be pathetic?
10that makes no sense

/whois Higurashi
7Oh em gee.
7why should I care?
I dunno, you said she was scared to come on.
7Frequently.
7besides, YOU said it originally.
Me?
7yes.
When?
7a day or two ago. You continued with "I've seen their 'life ruination tactics'. Fail."
I was just commenting on that section of their site.
7Someone did, and my money's still on you.
7they know who she is. If they want to they could get them
Pff, how? They don't know her first or last name.
The most I ever said was that she was scared of them, not that they made her too scared to come on here.
She repeatedly said herself that she was "scared".
7meh
7ah.
7then why the fuck are you pissing all over me? I don't care beyond that she doesn't come on here much.
I'm just telling you.
God. Anger management much?
7Heh. I could say the same.
How have I been angry since I've joined here?
I just explained something I thought you might want to know and you blow your top.
Wth do you mean?
I was just explaining something to him.
which is why I think it was funny
...I still don't see what you are talking about.
nevermind
Your greeting has been noted.
:P
2:3
I've been exceedingly bored lately.
It's on a whole new level.
Since school, of course. :/
2I have been more depressed recently, although it has nothing to do and the already alarmingly large stack of homework I have :|
Whe did you start?
*When
2Start what?
School.
And the depression, I guess.
2Last Thursday
2Meh idk about that one
Dari was explaining how your guy's school worked to me, lol.

Way to disrupt the water.

6Hai
Damn.
6o.o
(I managed to get a cut down my back, only about 10 cm long, but it's annoying)
BRB
"A girl’s collection of Pokemon cards was was stolen at knifepoint by a gang near Gothenburg in western Sweden, says The Local."
7Lol
.___.
Hah.
2o.O
Back.
Since when do gangs steal pokemon cards?
2O_O
I know this guy who used to love Pokemon
But he hates it now
Because he couldn't get a Blastoise card
Lol.
2Lol, practically all the boys at my primary school used to pretend they were being PokÃ©mon xD
I would think they steal more for the rush of it than the actual loot.
2XD
Why is it that some cuts weep, and others don't. O_o
Haha, everyone used to bring Pokemon cards to school
7dari: some are more sensitive than others.
I never played the card game
2Its to do with how the cut was made, I think o.o
Or where, rather.
7I like my answer better
Doesn't that mean it's infected if it weeps?
I got this cut from a rusty nail.
So...
Ough
2Me neither but the boys used to actually BE the pokemon XD
*Ouch
That's not good
Woot, spine infection.
2Rusty nail? Blee
2O_O
Brb.
Me and my best friend in like second grade would bring these rubber balls with Pokemon figures in them and bounce them against the wall to have "battles" XD
7so you played PokÃ©squash?
lolno
It was like
Also, can burns get infected?
Whoever didn't catch theirs first loses the battle
Or something like that
2Pokesquash! Good one!
2Burns can, yes.
Meh, dammit.
2Well, any open wound can
2Hm, why dammit?
I put my hand on a rusty pole, and I've got a burn on my hand.
=/ I haven't seen someone playing jacks in forever
That was probably popular like, 20 years ago
2Whoops.
2Wtf are jacks?
2http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1-NZWtTJYI :')
http://www.myjanee.com/gallery/drawings/jacks.jpg
That's jacks
6WHEN'D YOU PEOPLE START TALKING AGAIN D:<
You're supposed to bounce the ball and pick up the right number of spiky things every turn
I only played it when I was little because my mom taught me how
2Ohhh, I know what that is XD
6Hey =D
Anyways brb class
6k
6Why'd I open a new tab? o.o
2Because tabs are made of cheese, and you wanted some cheese, perhaps? X3
7"Here we are now, eating tables. Help the stupid, they're contagious."
6lol maybe
7"Here we are now, in the 'tato."
7"I'm a lighter."
7"and albino!"
7"I'm a skittle, I'm a ditto."
6http://twitpic.com/h0c77 ...
hoc, lol. Latin.
7"I was in blood, I confessed."
7"A fool was killed for free breast."
6Oh ya,that's why I opened a tab
7"I met a girl, whose sauce smelled."
/me 6opens it again
7"And always ran with Taliban."
7(lots of hellos)
2See heer?
7and repeat.
/me 2facepalms
6*confuzz*
7It's teen spirit misheard
7*points up*
6Oh
2"Buger King is better." "Indeed."
6It creeped me out when I first heard it..
7"And I forget, just why I taste."
7"I vomit hard, it's hard to vomit."
Wth is teen spirit?
From Nirvana?
7some song.
6Lol
"Smells Like Teen Spirit"
2Dari: Nirvana song. See above.
Hey.
It sounds stupid.
7I like the 'tato thing.
It is, but it was once a hit/
7"I'm a nightgown."
6lol
6o.o
6OH FOR FUCKS SAKE
2... Whats up C7?
She just likes swearing.
It's evident.
/me 6stays silent
6Nah
Oh for fuck's sake = Oh for the sake of fuck ...It doesn't really make sense.
Especially since it isn't a noun.
7she refuses to ellaborate because I labelled her the official complainer.
6That girl's pestering me with the flag game again
7Dari: Yeah shut the fuck up no-one likes a pedantic.
6I never refused
7Ever.
You say no one, which doesn't really make sense, I have friends.
6Still,I'm just sick of that game..-.-
2STFU cos nobody likes pediatricians!
2JEEZ
6o.o
I hate that abbreviation.
Cos. Doesn't even make sense.
7Pendantics, Stacey.
6I bet now she'll get pissed off or something
2Yeah, but I do NOT like pediatricians fyi.
Is the word spell becos? I think not. :P
Anyway, in response I could say, shut the fuck up, no-one lieks you, always bitching about something or other.
7Dari: Again, pedanticness.
2:P
Lol.
7it is spell?
Is that how your pronounce the ending of because? I'm curious.
Respondin gto someone is not pedantic.
6Aww..she cancelled it : D
Get yourself a dictionary. :)
6brbus
^Lameus
7Dari: No, of course not. But being a pedantic douche IN that response IS being a pedantic.
2Wow.
Which response?
2Everyone on the be right back bus!
2:3
Did anyone else think what he said was pedantic? Haha.
7"You say no one, which doesn't really make sense, I have friends."
6Lol
So disagreeing with you is pedantic?
7No. You can spin your bullshit any which way, it's still being pedantic.
I still maintain that you should look up pedantic, proving that people do like me is not being pedantic.
/me 2cries
6D:
7Yes, but pointing out the flaws of a commonly accepted term IS being pedantic.
I know this guy at school who never really stops talking. Since the first day I met him he'll always approach me, recite a Family Guy line that he recalls from the night before and then leaves.
6HE WROTE
I was pointing out that I had friends/
Murder, she wrote.
2...
6o.o
6Whatebur
/me 6reads what Mike wrote
7Dari: Yes. But you were still being pedantic. Make me repeat myself some more, please, I enjoy it.
Also, no one likes someone who constantly bitches. Like you. Grow up please.
7Not constantly bitches. I do occaisionally try and have a conversation normally.
You ALWAYS have something to complain about.
The first thing you do when you come on is start moaning at someone.
^ Quoes
*quotes
7Dari: You're never ON when I come on. You don't deign to notice this place until you need something or have no-one else to talk to.
2He takes the michael out me sometimes O_O
2....that was a fail actually, you're both online right NOW.
Now who's being pedantic, and disputing a commonly used phrase.
7Stacey: Note that I said 'when I come on'.
7Yes, but at least I'll admit it BEFORE I can suddenly use it against you.
2Wow, you sure like ignoring half of my comments.
You may be the first person I've heard who used that word, actually.
Besides in books.
7what word?
Pedantic.
2HURRHURR
7Ah.
7It's still a word.
Anyway, I remember you used to like loop-holes, to find a loop-hole usually means nit-picking, which is pedantic.
6I feel like it's the 24th of August..
Didn't say it wasn't.
7Dari: Mmm. So do you, in fact. And note 'used', past tense. I HAVE grown up, but you appear to still enjoy temper tantrums.
/me 6watches the little bit they show of her school on TV with the politician dude
It feels like it's September 11.
I calmly stated a fact, you started whining about nothing.
Oh wait, it is. ;)
7Nah, Dustbins smell bad. Skips the smell is more spread out and mingled.
6lol
2My dad just edited the shopping list on the board in the kitchen
You clearly have not grown up, or you wouldn't start an argument for a stupid reason.
2It now says 'TOILET FILM' and 'CLING ROLLS' O.O
6"The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources." Sun Tzu, The Art of War What's that supossed to mean? >.<
Hey, I read that book.
6o.o
Anyway, think what you like, I don't really care. If you have grown up, you will step down now, like I'm doing.
And I'm guessing it means that for a good plan to work there has to be someone executing it who is resourceful and improvisses.
*improvises
7Actually, while my response to you wasn't entirely 'mature' (you want maturity here and you're delusional, anyway) you could've just shrugged it off, accepted it or moved on, but instead you leapt at the chance to continue something stupid. Besides the argument really doesn't start until the first person responds again (now we've both been pedantic twice).
7When exactly did you step down?
2You're both being immature by arguing about this actually o.o
I said like I'm doing, in other words that post was me stepping down.
7Fair enough.
7I do have a team to organise in a competition anyway, so I'm off for a while.
Wanna trip like I do, behbeh?
7I'll give you a trip.
6o.o
6That' nice
After galloping through a wooden glen and punch-dancing out my inconsisancies I decided to make the unending end.

12Rofl
12o;
12LOL
12Pixie faerie emo slut sparkly vampire
12BAHAHAHAHA...XD
12SPARKLES WTF.
“Humans sun burn due to the scorching of living cells in our system. Vampires do not have this, so there should be no reaction to the sun because of the lack of living cells to communicate the reaction to the rest of the body. The lack of cells also means the lack of pores, rendering the vampire with a perfectly smooth and hard skin. Similar to marble. Marble, of all kinds, sparkles. Thus the light is refracting off the stone hard skin, as it
Haha, yeah, let's explain the sparkles with science =/
12why must you always disagree.
12;_;
I'm not disagreeing
12oh. nevermind.
12xD
Sparkling vampires = fail
12Yup
12I didn't buy it
12I didn't buy the movie either

Wagh
ow
D:
hehe
:P
Hello.
Hi
Are you new?
Yes
How new?
Thought so.
:P
I lost the game guys ):
Game?
/me is listening to music while simultaneously writing. We'll see how that works.
4Funk
0.o
What perfect timing
I just got off of Skype
:P
o.O
So do you want to get these ranks over with or what? =P
Why is that guy calling you Husky?
I don't get it
4no it is my friend
4but he used my rant and said it was hers
Oh
Did she steal your rant or he just thought it was hers?
4No, he used mine to reply to hers. He knew which one was hers and mine
7Good afternoon.
7;o
7Quick question, how come I can't PM to you guys (how come I can't talk to you personally?)
7*sees him go bye bye*
Hi iSO
7Tis nice to see you talking nao. XD
Why can't you PM now?
7No... :<
<+iSO> Quick question, how come I can't PM to you guys (how come I can't talk to you personally?)
7I clicked your name, and PM, and nothing happened. D:
7In the chatroom.
Are you using the main site?
Spyrochat.com?
7Yes.
Try the /msg command
/msg nickname message
Lol, the messages should open in another tab
I don't think PM's work if you go through the SpyroChat link
7Hmmm. :<
I'm getting the PMs, but maybe you can't recieve them back
I think he has to get a standalone client
or connect through the main Mibbit site
Or mibbit.com
Yeah
www.mibbit.com/chat/
7Chatroom name and server?
#spyrochat
7I actually know Mibbit, I just need those two.
irc.epic-chat.net
#spyrochat
7Sounds custom. :o
well it was created by someone lol
so yeah it is custom
what's custom?
I'm guessing the network :P
7NM,
Oh :P
7It's listed in the website.
7The list of all the servers. X3
7*will be testing*
yay :)
Yeah it's good.
The freaking question is,
Why does the other one wouldn't work with PM and maybe other functions?!
because the other one is just a basic connection
you're not using the full capabilities that Mibbit has to offer
it's just a basic connection with your name and such to the chatroom
Did modes ever work on Spyrochat.com?
Mibbit allows us to use the Nick feature to identify users but it doesn't allow anything else beyond normal chatting
No
You know, you realize that when you try logging in via SpyroChat.com, the browser records your password?
But I could
=/
In order to access such functions you have to have a standalone client
7Hm.
Yeah, the password shows up in the URL
7Anyways, it's a quiet day yes?
o.o
Yeah
It's pretty quiet here most of the time
7And that, yeah. That one bugs me in consideration of privacy.
that's why you should get a standalone client
7I mean, Mibbit is pretty much open-hacked. :|
Mibbit sucks
yah it does
end of story
Spyware FTW
Thank you and good night
You mean FTL?
7*shoots RedDraggieX-ie*
:P
/me goes back to blowing shit up
lol
why would you shoot me?
7*shifty*
7No comment. :)
and if you want the chat to get a little more al ive then encourage members to come on here
we use to have a group that would come on every day no matter what
then slowly it disapated over time
7Why not make a new group? >:3
7XD
Thanks to stupid 888chan :<
7I'm pretty chatty at times, even tho I'm a pretty quiet person.
well it was dying before 888 started too
7It's that the dumb troll?
The group of dumb trolls, yes
like I said if you want it to be more active encourage other members to come here
7Let's see what I can do...
I'm linking to the epic-chat.net website in my signature on some sites
Probably won't help much, but...
I've already got it in like five sites
7I'd been into another chatroom, but I outgrowned it after the people had done so much without me. :o
7;o
hm
Well
7What do you guys do during real life?
This
:P
and games
and coding
and school
7Coding? Programming?
7:P
Yup
Most of us IRC freaks do something involving computers :P
yep
7Heh.
I'm learning Java in school
Computer Networking for me
And I do some HTML coding on the side for my own amusement
7I particularly draw. :3
7Care for a juicy example? XD
7Just say yes.
7...:;o
Um, yes
:P
7http://www.mariowiki.com/images/b/bd/Page0-5Final.png
7It's 4.5MB!
7I had to compress it with PNG Monster! :3
7Originally 5Mb, tis 4.5Mb nao!
not bad
.__. That's gonna take forever to load on this computer
7Look closer, you can see things connected.
wow
I draw, but not well :P
7Just thank me that I removed 500KBs of uncompressed rots.
sweet
are you any good at drawing Spyro?
7I mentioned something of me haven't drawn Spyro, I forgot him after I was forced to do more schoolwork because of failing grades.
7:<
7At least I found out about that purple dragon in 2006. That saved me a bundle! xP
7Do you know what's the weird thing about Spyro drawings?
what
7The lack of good buildings that came from the old Spyro series.
7The drawings.
7I'll give you an example that has the feeling of them. :3
7This is clearly an example of how fresh the background is. X3
Enchanted Towers
Best level ever
:P
7God!
7It's been SO LONG!
7I wan to play the last Spyro game!
7*want
7In the original series that is.
A Hero's Tail?
7Sorry,
7Year of the Dragon. :D
oh in the original Trio
7Indeed.
I was just talking to one of my old friend from this forum about the old games
Who else had trouble with that Agent 9 level in Fireworks Factory?
7You know, I heard some people hated the 2 and third game because the seemingly lack of dragons in place.
:P
7I'm pretty glad that Spyro 3 is a mix of 1 and 2. :D
Dude, iSO, your picture is still loading XD
7o_O
7Are you using dial-up?!
Lolno
7It sounds like dial-up to me. D:
I've never used dialup in my life
7Netzero?
No
7No FiOZ?
7Verzion fiber.
...I dunno what that is :P
7;|
7Then I can't tell. D:
7I should really draw Spyro one day.
My college campus probably just has a bad connection
7But I have to draw someone else... first. ;)
And the fact that I'm on this tiny laptop might have something to do with it
I got banned on my old college campus from the internet for a semester
O.o
Why?
7;o
Downloading off Limewire
Ah
I forgot to turn the uploads off ><
7Ah yes, the yummy "illegal" stuff. >;3
so they found out what I was doing
7XD
7Ahhh...
oh well
I didn't go back to school there anyways
7Well, I figured out that you guys are older than me, yes? Since people around 9-14 talk like "wat itz teh leetz !!11!"
7I don't really do that kind... *shifty*
I'm 18
RDX is 20
7And I'm 15.
7And Micheal Jackson died after one month of my birthday. o_O
7Tis a coincidence.
I was just reading a thread about Micheal Jackson from a while back
That Game Girl 2007 got into yet another flame war
o.o
7Is that a user?
no
it's your mother
:O
I'm offended
Yeah that's a user
You'd better be offended
7Shut your trap Rick. ;o
:P
Rick, lol
Rock
lol
7Have you guys made any recent RPs?
I don't RP
I've tried it once and got bored reading everyone's posts =P
lol
7You heard of it,
I used to do IM rp's
But not forum
7But you never participated it?
7No, not a forum RP, that's too slow!

12o.O
12;-;
12gtg mann
Just got back from the Langley classic car show.
nice
Yay done
I'll email them to you
sweet
send them to Brad too
he wants to see them
OK
Probably a good idea to send them to me before applying them ;)
You have to apply them anyway
we don't have the capabilities
yeah
we wouldn't do that anyways
we're a little smarter then that ;)
why
Its awesome.
in what way
little description if you can
I'll admit it doesn't take much to be better then Vista lol
I doubt my laptop will run it =/
Fast, sleek, compatible with a lot of windows xp stuff, light
It will
aspire one could run it no problem.
Pretend vista didn't exist
when did you try it out?
this is what you would expect as an upgrade for xp.
I installed it on most of my home pcs.
hmm
I'll have to look into it
Ive been running it for a week.
if it's based on XP that would be great
easier for my Networking classes
Its basically a rewrite of vista.
dont get me started on the networking
its so simple.
and it has multitouch, it makes my touchsmart kick ass.
Ok anyways
Theres a bunch of cool multitouch demos, some are from microsoft surface.
I meant in terms of my entire networkings course is based off XP
not Vista
Oh
confurging your network is pretty much irrelevent in windows 7
it does it all for you.
Damn
OK
Depends, but if you have a problem you have to get into the circuits and figure it out
How small do you want them?
windows 7 is all plug and play.
most of the time yeah it will do everything for you
It reconized everything automatically on my network
installed drivers
done
I'm not talking about recognition
I just mean in terms of basic mechanics
if something goes wrong you know how to fix it
about 25% smaller
hardware recognition has developed greatly ever since basic XP came out
Not much goes wrong at my home when it comes to the network
so I couldn't say.
Probably different in a business setting
windows 7 seems very ready for business use
Id use it if I had a business that needed an upgrade.
if you can't network at home you're an idiot lol
You can network anywhere, it does everything for you.
they make it so easy now with the NIC's it's not even funny
people don't usually need to mess with hardware.
Unless your building stuff.
I know
that's why it's so simple
if you screw it up you're a moron
yep
In a business environment yeah it's not so simple
even though win7 makes stuff easy
it doesn't think your a moron like osx does.
lol
I think even in a business enviroment setting everything up with win7 would be simple if you got all your routers and switches working.
what does your teacher say about osx?
true but you also need the correct cabling in place
we haven't gotten into it yet
I'll ask him on Monday
Most stuff is color coded, pretty simple
even more simple if everything is wireless.
I should write down half the stuff you say, ask him, then bring it back lol
see what you say about it
yeah but not all business use wireless
they should
saves a lot of trouble
yeah they should
but they don't
id tell them to spend a few dollars to upgrade to wireless so theres no dicking around with stuff for future additions of workstations
well I forgot to ask him that the other day
I'm sure their is some kind of reason
yeah ask him
if theres any reason not to use wifi instead of wired.
its much easier to add new workstations then
and not have to run cable.
it also makes it easy to add wifi printers
and NAS
there is
Half the time I'm fucking around on the computer
I'm sure it has to do with some kind of expenses or what not
wifi is quite cheap
espexially for business use
you can buy in bulk
yeah I'll be sure to ask him
right, check your emails again
Better
we still have to come up with names for the ranks
And ranges
I had it on a 15 scale before
http://www.flickr.com/photos/42448313@N03/sets/72157622224474669/
Now we have 11 so I'll have to start over

some good signs
althogh most of the comments are liberal
fuck em
yep
Obamacare is coming!
enjoy it.
You will pay for everyone but yourself.
fuck em all
Just like I do.
I haven't seen a doctor in 5 years
lol
but I still pay for everyone else.
of course
the beautiful thing about Liberal Healthcare
pay for every lowlife dumbshit who can't fend for themselves
that way they will be dumb enough to keep voting us to office
yes
you heard about what he did for back to school supplies right?
gave everyone who was on welfare $200 per child to go buy school supplies.
Smart eh?
of course
another fucking chunk of change I rightfully earned
send their idiot kids to school
where they won't give a shit anyways
what amazing logic

/me hides
14lol
12you can claim you got a huge collection
12but i'm the one that really puts your collection to the test :P
14Yeah over 15000 songs
12what about mozart?
14LOL hell no
12lawl
14Hiya Xeli
10Hey :>
12you need tribal ink
12D:
14Why? XD
12makes your collection unique
14My collection is unique :P
12so many people don't know about tribal ink
12excluding everyone who has used limewire
14ewww limewire
/me RUNS
12lol
12tribal ink gained fame because one of their songs somehow got listed as "what i've done" on limewire
14looooooool
14limewire makes me laugh
12indeed
14Can't remember what song it was but it was Death Metal, it somehow got listed as hip hop on limewire
10o_O
12lol
10Limewire, eww
12wow
14I was on the floor laughing at that
12to my face is actually decent
10what
14I stopped using limewire/frostwire about 9 months ago
12Tribal Ink - To My Face
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t20iA4dFs2Y
14That's interesting
14So the mystery band has been found in my collection
12lol
12you don't even know what you got do you?
14One of the albums that came with an MP3 disc of linkin parks albums collection
14Came with THAT song
12LOL
14plus a few others
12i told you
12linkin park songs got mixed up with their songs
14I GOD DAMN KNEW IT WASN'T LINKIN PARK
14Just could never figure out how it was
14Now I can kick my brother in teh face and prove him wrong
12you're not the first person to fall victim to that
14He is convinced the "album" IS linkin park XD
12it's still ironic that that was how they gained fame
14Indeed it is
12because of limewire and their songs being labled wrongly lol
12almost makes you think they did it themselves
14Know the album name Glacy?
12hold on i have it
14You know the funny thing about "the album" it was titled something I can't mention on SW XDD
12Surrounded By Freaks
14Now I has to rename them XDD
14I need to listen to song and match it XD
12hopefully that page helps you
12The album became popular in 2007, as it was confused with Linkin Park's new album Minutes to Midnight. In P2P filesharing most of Tribal Ink's songs were misnamed with songs from Linkin Park's new album Minutes To Midnight (in P2P sharing sites often called "Minutes To Midnight Advance/Advace XXL").
12lol
14XD
12best part too is that according to tribal ink's myspace
12they know about it too
12last i heard, that was what gave them the push to make them work on another album however i haven't seen it yet
14Well I've got all the songs renamed :)
12that was fast

07o3o
I haven't read the webcomic in a while
12I'm SO mad
12There's a postal strike here.. >v>
07?
??
why?
07O.-.o
o.o
07buy a carrier burd o3o
12I paid £60 for a monthly bus pass right, and now I have to pay extra every day to get into work because it hasn't arrived
/me brick'd
07D=
12So it's made the money I saved from buying it POINTLESS
bad timing
12Because I actually have to spend more
2ouch
post is fail half the time anyway
wait so does it expire in a month even though you haven't got it yet?
12It does.. yes
12But the point is, it should be saving me money all this week but I have to buy tickets ontop of that :/
07call the place and get a refund?
12Gonna try but it doesn't look good.
12They sent it out already, they can't help it if the postal services go on strike
14Nevermind brb again
14I have bad timing sometimes :(
04Gues
04*Guys
04I have a theory.
04You know know the Shinto Ruins point north of Johto in the Pokegear map?
04Maybe that's the location of a Gen5 region! :O

14ty
I thought txspk wasn't allowed in here

07Yeah?
Wasn't sure if you were here since the "AFK"
Take it Arti isn't here... still don't know what she thinks about hiring another moderator
Quan would be good
07I would've been on earlier but I fell asleep at noon..
07Er
076PM*
Yeah. The forums and Shoutbox earlier
Noon my time, 6PM yours?
07Yes
07Lol my boyfriend is in EST so yar
I really think another mod for the forums is needed at this point
11 AM my time then
07Im so used to operate in EST
07Ah
07lol
If you were on the forums more, you could easily be a mod there
It's just getting chaotic with a few "problem users"
07I don't think I have the time
07Nor the dedication
07I love the chat, I've been a chat member primarily ever since I got here.
I like it here, too, though I don't come on as often as I used to
07Any reason?
Busier, want to write, couple events discouraged me (most of the active people in here are younger than me)...
And my Internet connection at my apartment sucks
07Ah
07Yeah
07How old are you?
07:A
07*:>
07I remember so well when I was the youngest TST chat member LOL! It's so different now
I'm 21
07Ah ^^
07I'm younger than you then ovO;
There are a plethora of members ages 12-17 in here
I've always been one of the older guys here. I've only been at TST for like a year.
07I'm 17 myself o_O wow
07it's so funny to think I've been here since I was 13 x.x WHO ATE THE TIME.

who has a myspace?
not me
10I do...not
why not?
6I do, rarely go on anymore
why?
10Why should we?
10Personally, it never interested me to even have one
no reason! i was just asking?!
god dang...
why?
.
hi skylands :>
Why get worked up over a counterquestion?
6So you're back from Italy, Nick?
i was asking for no reason, i was just asking one of those kinda questions
yes
unfortunately
why is there me saying why after the first one......................
just like the time i asked what is everyone's eye color, and they all responded and i responded with a simple answer: orange
6Did you have fun?
back in lame-o england >>
YES
Italy is win
And Crain asked why we should. Nothing wrong with that.
any photo evidence of orange eyes yet?
6What fun things did you get to do? :>
went to venice for the day
saw miss italy, meow
Nick: yew dayng yuruhpeeins.
/me highfives Nick ITALY RULEZ!
a days enough isn't it Nick
in venice
hi
for some maybe
14>w<
but I loved Venice I wanted to see the museums and stuf
a
Flygon: Now, here's the problem: it's sort of hard to believe someone has orange eyes.
XD took your time to reply
Minus the sort of.
hi drf
but meh i believe you
6You should post some pictures you took in Italy, I'd love to see them @ Nick
look, if someone was born with the genes for Orange Eyes, then the next person in the generation has a good chance of getting them
10I know someone who has one green eye and one brown eye
14Why we be talking bout eye color?
/me is gonna create a photobook of his venice shots
Did they have a twin?
just because
Crain
10Flygon was giving off some random example and it was about eye colors
10Hmm?
I've never seen someone with 'orange' eyes.
Did they have a twin?
10I don't think so, no
14I know cats can have orange eyes.
That usually only happens to twins.
cats r stupid
6D:
14owo
/me loves cats
10My friend says that she hates all cats because they're mean, except for my cats
you can make em follow string its so funny :3
cats rule
10The only thing is: She's only met my cats
xDDD
10Lol, I remember tieing a piece of string to my cat's tail and watch him run around in circles
i dont know how, i just have oragne eyes, end of story
epiclol
but how did you get the string around its tail?
You mean brown?
FlygonTheDesertSpirit> look, if someone was born with the genes for Orange Eyes, then the next person in the generation has a good chance of getting them <-- only if the genes coding for orange eyes are dominant, if they are recesive then there is a slim probability
10Very carefully....
Still never seen anyone with 'orange' eyes.
which my dad and my grandfather has orange eyes
hey there
10Blue and brown color genes are the dominant, aren't they?
10Hey
you dont have too see orange eyes, but now you met someone so be happy >:p
10Skeptical minds~
10Usually people have to see it, to believe it
*I
I don't usually believe things people say on the interwebz.
well, im sorry but i got in trouble wif my mom when i put pictures up on da Internet
14How about just your eye? Nothing else?
10Then we won't believe it, you don't have to force us all to believe
Convenient excuse is convenient.
i have black and white pictures
Kipikippers: yes.
XD Repeat^
10XD
14That just makes it more suspicious.
Moving on
10I'm watching "A Haunting" ....

10I just mean the end of the sentance, is that supposed ot mean something?
10Ah, ok

italy was awesome!
03what
07PM
04that's all everyone wants
03OK
04the dawty version
awesome Nick! I hope you took lots of pictures!
03yeah but I don't like swearing in music >_>
03I mean, not even Walmart had it
03only in CD format
need to sort through them but still
I did
?
cool, :)
07I didnt realize that song even had any type of clean version. What did they just bleep over everything?
03Yeah kinda :/
03Stupid idiot record labels
03They played some stuff backwards
03this song Boombox is pretty interesting too
03the lyrics are o_O but it's catchy
/me does not like clean versions
04^ this
03I <3 them
03I make my own edits sometimes
07Im grown, I refuse to listen to clean versions
03I mean, really, I just don't like explicit music
03Why can't people be more like Will Smith and not cuss all the time
will smith
the scientologist?
07I like Eminem's quote for that one.
that's like being a mormon, but even worse
03Will Smith isn't scientologist, his wife is
03and even if he is, he's not *insane* like Tom Cruise
becuase even professing a belief in scientology wouldn't be insane
and dunno about it just being his wife
03and as far as Eminem... I mean, he does really good songs like Mockingbird and of course he can't go an entire song without swearing >_>

03anyway, 64-bit is worth it if you have more than 3.2GB of [RAM

Heya hey ;>
03so yeah, you might want 64-bit
04but anyway, debating over completely wiping Vista and doing a fresh install when 7 comes out
03YES
03DO IT
07You better not be talking to me DRF!!! :D
/me runs
03Of course I am
03LOL
04i've heard there are compatibiliy issues
04Vista sucks so badly
03Reminds me of a failblog picture on a clothing tag "Just give it to your wife, it's her job!"
yeah
06I think Vista's okay.
03Altair, there are compatibility issues yeah :/ but there are ALWAYS gonna be issues with any OS
03and at least with XP Mode you can solve 99% of problems by emulating XP
03Except the fricking Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter
03because that doesn't like 64-bit
03and that's stupid
04My gpu can be overclocked
03Mine probably can too, I dunno
04and for some reason, it crashes when I play games after overclocking i
04t
03I'm not gonna test it
04Not on XP though >>
03I literally just finished reinstalling a bunch of programs
03because my computer crashed
04:/
06I use vista, and I don't have any problems. It's actually better for me than XP was
03Both Windows AND Linux died
03in the same day
03I was like, wtf
04o_O
03yeah
03Epic fail, right?
04I can't stand it
03so I reinstalled both
03LOL I can't stand it either
06meh...
04also hi CR XD
04Missed the join in a wall of text lul
07Really leaving this time. Lol. Bye everybody.
04But yeah, my multi-card reader doesn't work in Vista

12lolk
/me hugs back. "Bye"
12bai Kipi~
10Cya Kipi
03Altair, wait what? The serials are for Windows 7 Professional
04cya Kipipi
12and last time i reinstalled windows onto this laptop
03I reinstalled already and you can re-actiavte it XD
04Ok, that's what I was meaning
03*activate
12drivers were being a horrible pain
03I'm trying to get the ISO files so that I can upload them for you guys
07k
04awesine
04*some
07tell us when you have them up?
Buh-bye
03I'm downloading the 32-bit right now as it's actually letting me
07from where?
03the 64-bit says I have to "request an additional download", so I might just try ripping the copy I burned
03MSDNAA
07ah
12that's the only thing holding me back drf :P
12drivers
04i hope my drivers will work in 7
03They should
04i ran the compatibility thing and it said everything checks out
12i have no doubt they would
03my 7 CAME with drivers
03The only thing you have to get manually is video drivers
04:o
03but if you use NVIDIA, just go to their site and they have them
12it's just that last time i reinstalled vista onto this laptop
04well i have those
04nvidia here
07does 7 keep your installations when upgrading from XP?
12which was the first time i reinstalled windows, drivers became such a pain
03but it automatically had the sound c1ard, the Wi-Fi card, the LAN thingy
03it had all the drivers I'd need
03Kyu, you can't upgrade directly from XP to 7, no
03you have to do a clean install
07ah
03it'll keep your *files* though
04i would do a clean install but idk
12yeah
03Clean installs are the way to go
04too lazy
04i have everything on another partition but eh
12i think i want a key
03and Altair, my friend proved yesterday you can't upgrade from Vista Home Premium to 7 Professional
12i'll risk it
03it won't let you
04i have ultimate :D
03hm
03it might let you then
04more like not-so-ultimate amirite
03I know Business upgrades to Professional
03yeah
03Ultimate would upgrade to Ultimate but I can't get 7 Ultimate
07lol
12i'll just do a clean install
12lol
03and honestly, what difference does it make?
12then install wubi again
037 Ultimate only has added languages and some secure booting thing
03it's completely not worth it
03wubi the Linux thing?
12yes
03I heard that sucks
12it wouldn't let me partition the system
04i have ubuntu installed as well atm
03It's usually better to make a dedicated partition for Linux
12so i did the next best thing lol
04but i never really use it
03I have it actually *intsalled*
03*installed
03I will, because of my programming classes
woo msn is working now =D
04:)
12otherwords i would drf
04o-O
12i would be more than happy to partition ubuntu onto this laptop lol
03Windows 7 has a built in partitioner XD
12yayz
03like, you can shrink your C drive
04does it see ext3? :P
03My friend did it
03No.
03it says unknown partition
04well then it still fails lol
03but I mean it can shrink and enlarge NTFS
04well, it's a start
03there's a thing you can download to make it see ext3...
03vista had that too actually, but who cares about Vitsa LOL
04I have that for Vista
03*Vista
vista = never fails, and has great interuptting updates =D
going now, and not likely to get back on so night everyone
04I love it when Vista gets into a update fail cycle
04Reboot, finish updating, fail, reboot, repeat
12heh
03XD
12i had that once
12and i only noticed it before april 4th
so freaking annoying
12there's a way to fix the problem
04i literally raged
i remember i didn't update (ignore update) and then it crashes on me T_T reboot
04it took me forever to fix it
12you have to delete a folder or two
04or figure out how
03wait, how did it fail?
03Like it gave an error oqr what?
03-q
12failed to install updates
04yeah
03And then it shuts of?
03*off
04Yep
04then it would do the same thing
04Infinitely lol

03The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
03The script did not produce correct headers. It must at least print out a Content-Type header, like so:
03Content-Type: text/html
03The header the script produced was:
03HTTP/1.0 200 OK
03I'll fiddle with it

07a spider landed on my arm
6LOL
07a small one
6that happened to me last night
6I squeeshed it on my keyboard
07i crushed it with a tic tac box
12yawn
6I crushed it with my thumb
6o-o;;
6archnaphobia much?
07i flinched from my cell phone
12that's me
/me 6adds this to the picture
12kyu
12one time i was in my back yard when i felt something hit the back of my leg
12i look back and there was this gigantic spider on my leg
6but at least arachnaphobia is more logical than MY bigges fear
6bggest
12it most of been like 3-4 inches
6my second biggest fear: Running water in close/tight/small spaces
6My biggest fear: when the water in said space stops running
07OH NOES! The toilet in the small bathroom is broken!
/me runs
6example: I got stuck in a water slide (a tube slide with a raft) when it broke down
6my friend and I had to either wait there in the hot tube or climb back up
6there was no way in heck I was gonna wait that one out
07well that's rational
07since it's based on experience
6no, I've had the phobia since before that
6that was just an example of what I mean
07well before that you were just weird
/me brick'd
6I also had a nightmare related to the phobia XD

2http://ho-ohrealm.forumotion.net/debating-and-discussion-f18/lrn2internet-t129-30.htm
2*flaming
6oh lol

6oh rly now?
2Mer
6thats what I've been telling her for ages
hows bird rp going
/me 2is currently replying about the off-topic and flaming
2should I add that in there?
2about NS being a bit hyppocritical? O_o
6I'm going to keep an eye on that site as it's essentially the drama-group of TST in one smaller area
6do it
2lolk
2Roara
6I'd add my own comment in there, but it wouldn't be smart
6NS used to be really cool, but she's turned into a wannabe g00n
2are you a reg or anything?
2LOL yeah
2XD
2Hey Arti!!
6and I like g00n, but her ways are rediculously tr00by
12I agree.
6oh hai arti.......it's.....early o-o;
2yeah
2... whoa, you're right
07ohaiburd
2XD
12Yeh I have to leave for work in about 40 mins
2D:
2aaaaw
6soory
6one last clasic coment
6same person
6"Ah well, the drama in TST has died down recently, mainly due my absence and lack of trolling xD Truthfully, I just provoke everyone into being dramatic, but it\'s not me who is dramatic lol"
07?
07lol
2XD
2how ironic
04Who said that?
2just a litt- who do you think?
2Just a little while ago, she was defending herself that she wasn't the cause of the major cbox drama at all
6Arti it was
6hence me "same person"
04If I ever mention that she is gonna kill me (exsaggeration)
6so, I'd personally love to take the two comments I've posted and talk with her, but that's just me
6I wont because it's not necessary
2I hope so
04I don't know what to say to her lately
6same
04It's just, she doesn't seem as friendly anymore
6I used to be decent friends with her
2she's plenty friendly to me
04And I was really out down when she remarked my RP was "WH LOLOL"
6I can't tell you how many lines I've seen that are g00n's trademarks, and she uses them a thousand times over
04put*
2I just have a hard time getting her to straighten up P|

6btw lyon
04She needs to lrn2internet
6what rp?
04?
04The Bird RP
2good news: I've learned a bit more of internet slang and text-talk
2bad news: most of it is crude, and usually from NS or Xeli
6I take it the comment was removed?
04No, it was on the chat
6I learn it from g00n
04she said it to me
6oh
04still...
2O_o''
04Xeli commented on it how it was original
12Check that mod/admin topic please
2Heya
6ok
04But NS didn't like it, so she told me that
2that... that's either harsh or she meant something about how it was really cool

2but you know
04Check my dA
07what are Quan's?
2everyone think dragon-dogs are stupid/unoriginal
<Aurora> Pocket Foxes o3o <--- You mean Kyu?
6Kipi no
04I came up with a creature, but I'm not happy with it
2But I dun care 'cause they're mine C:
6lol
2Lyon
04?
6dragon dogs...
6lol
2why don't you show us?
6I've seen so many of them
04Ok
2we could give you some feedback
07lol
2Roara: O3o but...
04BTW I added you as a friend on dA
6not saying it's a bad thing
2... they look like foxes X3
07dragon-dogs are a bit weird
2well... can. in rare cases
2LOL Kyu
07their personalities clash
6if I was, I wouldn't have so many wolf characters
2thanks, Lyon
2LOL Kyu
2*+ Roar
2*Roara
04Alaraptors
6perhaps rotate the image?
6just a thought
04Dunno how to
2lol
6save image > preview > rotate
6the reupload
04O
6then
6I'm working with the pocket foxes to make them look more recognizable
2X3
2Hence the reason why I don't use the Ryuuken as an OS much
2also because I'm still working on them
2Oh, and Lyon
2http://a.imagehost.org/view/0453/Alaraptor_Information_by_LyonTheShadowLord
2C:
6I can't decide between anatomacally correct legs or short triangular "chibi" legs
2hm...
2lol Roara
07wouldn't chibi legs make it look like me? o3o
6I never draw you with chibi legs o-o
6are you supposed to have chibi legs o-o?
2hai Kyu
07i dunno lol

6XD
/me pokes Kyu using Aurora :P
2LOL Kyu
/me just waits
04My pics always takes ages to upload
6quick description: small fox only about 5-7'' in height, 3 body-length tails (often very floofy), large ears (think fennec fox) that are either pointed or floppy, working with the legs, possible inclusion of some kind of forehead-gem
6body length meaning from nose to hind

quote of life
6but you said you're homeschooled
I'm being homeschooled right now
I can't reeemmmmeeemmbbbeeerrrr.
6better than sitting in a lecture hall for 3 hours straight on ONE class
I can't even press shift on my keyboard.
;O
6.-.
It won't let me
It makes a weird beep noise and won't let me use shift.
Sticky keys is on?
6o-o;
No
It's working!
Yay
6my geez....
6it really HAS been a while
6ho did I overlook that?
6hw
6how
What?
Lol
6It's been literally AGES since I've uploaded ArtixLugia art
6I've had quite a few pictures drawn around here, but they must have wound up with all the other non-uploaded work I'e done
6I've
Typos much? lol
6yes >_<;
Bleh, I hate homework.
1. Where does Photosynthesis occur? In a plant.
XD
12http://web.archive.org/web/19961020014044/http://www.microsoft.com/
Chloroplasts. But look up the right spelling.
6oh hai bree
It's a plant! D:<
"chloroplasts" is right.
I got it right first time :>
I'm not putting that down
:
:\
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast
Dooooonneee.
I don't care about Chloroplasts!!!!!
/me flails.
You could be more specific, and say it's on the thylakoid membrane.
Lol
Anymore specific?
6it can be yes
Ooooh as in...?
6but I'm not going back 3 years of my life to Biology Adv.
I'm in sixth grade DX
6BioA failed
6lol
No. Any more specific, and you're down to the level of individual molecular interactions that only together constitute photosynthesis.
6I was in sophomore yeare
6year
6Vyl that's what I meant
Vyl: YYES!
:D
6wait
6but that's "how"
6not "where"
6so yeah, don't get anymore specific
HOW.
Link to explanation plz?
6I'm not doing your homework for you, go google it
As far as I can work out, the key reaction is "3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ ? C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O"
'-'
I'm done with my test lol
12heh
12google is your friend
6...
6atp o-o;
12huh?
6nothin
/me nibbles on Aurora
Adenosine triphosphate. Anyone with a passing interest in biology should recognise that one.
6I don't have a passing interest
6and I recognize it
/me 6runs
14lol
6<3
/me 6sploofs on him
14ROARA!
6^^
14:>
12i still remember in an 8th grade science test
Vyl: I wanna be smart too DX
/me splodehugs Aurora
14^^
12the extra credit question was "what color is the sun" and people got it wrong
6lol o---o
6people must never have looked at it then
12i don't think the sun is purple -.-
/me 6RUNS
12they looked at it
12but with sunglasses on
6LOL
12apparently
12because there were answers like purple and pink
The Sun is purplish
But we can't see those colours because the light bends through our atmosphere, and red and orange are the colours that reach our eyes most easily.
6um
6the sun is called a yellow star
6for a reason
The sun's color is it's emission spectrum.
6while it gives of white light, it is a yellow star
6off
But I saw that on a show DX
6>_>
It was an educational show :D
Red and orange aren't the colours best picked up by our eyes.
Green is. :P
I made a feral dog/wolf RPG forum :O
Blue and red are the colours our eyes are weakest with.
12my friend is color blind
My dad is colour blind.
12and he has a horrible time distinglishing purple from blue :(
6I have a color blind friend
6he has red-green blindness
My dad sucks at figuring out what is brown, and what is red.
I guess it isn't that bad.
But still.
6I'm glad I'm not color blind, as I'm alredy blind enough and color is all I can see without aid
12yeah
12but you'd make interesting art then D:
I have 20/20 vision! *Shot*
12my vision
12is 15/flygon
errr

12A red dragon
14:O

What's a "dragon guy"?
It's like the Science Guy, but obsessed with dragons.
Oh.
14Like me :P
12No he's not obsessed with dragons, he likes them and he has a dragon character
Same thing?
talk about being awkward :-(
?
Awkward?

What is?
Awkward!
o.o Okay.
Wb
/me breaks the silence with a high-pitched YOWL!
14Mah ears D:
14Hi Jess
:o A Jess
o.o
Now what?
Wb
is it too late to mention I also got two dragon characters?^^
bk
Almost
But you said it just in time
10wasfsadfsdg
ah yeah - well, that's me then
:p
/me sits on his rump, idely numming his tail.
the funny thing about one of the dragons: He's the son of a fire and an ice dragon
...
Where?
And who took my idea?
that's not your idea, it was mine
Because I have a phoenix character who uses that too.
How long for?
this particular character was created by me in 2003
no, 2002
XP Ya know, it's possible that you both came up with the idea on your own without stealing it from the other
You were first then.
I came up with it independantly.
's what I meant.
this particular dragon was the child of two ambassadors, to be precise. They should help seize the hate between the blue frost dragons of the north plains and the volcanic fire dragons of the highlands....
well, those two had quite some adventures to take...and my character was the result to be born
hi time
kyu's still asleep >:

hi Articuno \o\

03hi Articuno
03so you still found time to come on with work? LOL
I'm going to have to trawl though tonnes of emails to find the ones about activities I've done with TL
12Huh?
aswefc
12I'm not at work
yuck, why cant i just be flygon
03yeah I know
12Then what do you mean?

12Someone else is called Flygon..
"get back into the kitchen"
03LOL
10o_O
/me hides
03OMG, so guys, want to know something epic fail I did before?
12Well thats true to an extent but Xai isnt here tonight so I have the house to myself and that means I have time for TST :>
it keeps saying nickname already in use
12What?
03I made myself, the only account on this computer ,not an admin...
03Took a lot of putzing around in safe mode to fix
12FlygonTheDesertSpirit..... the name Flygon is registered by someone else...
10drf, that's sort of fail :(
it is?
03yeah
03My account was a "guest" account

03I had to make an admin account called temp, log into that, make my normal one admin, delete the other one... sigh
10._.

14FlygonTheDesertSpirit, whoever it is, you need'nt worry about them causing problems. I'm going to be on the cbox as much as possible to try and stop this drama and fail etc
03why not call it a sbox?

12Excuse me, when have I ever said I don't like bugs?
!lag

12Infact aren't I always going on abot how I LIKE them?
07lol

03IMO, if they'r eoutside, fine... but if they come in your house then that's the end for them
your mean
07not really
14Wasps are the only buggers I swat down
every bug that comes in my house, i catch them somehow and let them go to live there lives
true
07because most bugs that get in don't know how to get out
\ _ /
07so if you do nothing they die
07so why not kill them?
/me wants to burn all wasps and hornets to the ground
/me brick'd

12Who can recommend the best Wiki software? :>
07Hmmm I don't know ^^ sorry
14I wish I could recommend decent software full-stop XD
what do you mean software?
12>v>
12Someone please explain, I don't want to.
i know what it is
12Oh
07I'm motivated to start working out again - I'm starting to feel unattractive >>;
12What did you mean then?
07Lol
i dont know what you mean by WIKI sofware
12Ohr ight
07Wiki, as in
07the stuff wikipedia uses
07O.o
12You know the style of wikipedia
07is an example
ok
so like, the different types of Wiki's?
07Arti what do you want a wiki thing for?
14Arti, you need wiki software for the site or other related?
07XD
14Nice timing
/me knows me is not very intelligent when it comes to software and dowloading and stuff like that, i is only good at fixing computer
12I want it for a knowledgebase for TST mods
14Try this http://www.interspire.com/knowledgemanager/?gclid=CJeXqaaz9JwCFUxs4wodn1hAkA
12It's not free
07Oh Arti¨
07PM
14Oh free software
hmmm, so thats what kinda cranefly your looking at, interesting
so, its kinda like a Misquito eater
actually it is a misquito eater
07whozat?
whos that?
lol
i catch those things with my bare hands all the time
i can cah pidens now
Arti, they are not bad, just catch it with your hands
mosquitos are your friends
kl
O.o It's 13:00 already!?
i squish em the moment i see em
07sure
i hate Misquitos
DX Nuu
lol
14OMFG LOL!, my laptop's time settings were set to GMT -8 Canada XD
here is my opinion and my way of always catching bugs without hurting them, put each hand on each side of the Cranefly, then wait for it to touch your and then cup your other hand around it, simple as that
07why not GMT -8 California?
07D=
14Same Difference Kyu XD
07but.....
07Canadia!
07D=
14No buts!
XD
I use a tennis racket to catch bugs.
i am in Dealware ((technically in italy at the moment for vacation)) but i live in Delaware
They go splat.
I use a boot
07an electric tennis racket!
Indeed.

12BF I can't be rude to my family.

07My family ties are too weak.

it's being reasonable!
07My grandparents on my father's side all think I'm very unsociable and ungrateful etc z.z

Pff. Screw parents.
/me quotes what he would say
12When I told Xai that he went through the roof. I mean it's not like we'd ever win the lottery but it's the fact that if we ever had a large sum of money, they'd expect us to use it on them!

Otherwise you'd be seeing Machamp floating around!

06Or a drawing of Raikou or something. 8D
Haha, good luck with the PB XD
06RORA.
hi ^^
AKA not happening.
/me pokes Rora
06>v>
6why am I poked?
6oo
06Do you even play Neopets, Rynn?
12hai Roara~
06Kyu is kinda rich. :\
/me coughs
6o-o?
6oh neopets
6XD
06I remember what you said, butbutbutbutbutbutbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut...
I used to play, not anymore.
06At least try? D=
07try to what?
06To get mah present.
I just know the Faerie PB is like ridiculously hard to find.
06If you don't you have to draw Raikou for me. 8D
/me is shot
06Rynn, you don't have to FIND it.
06You have to BUY it.
06The only two ways I can think of to get it otherwise are random events or Keyquest (Gold Key, of course).
Who said finding it didn't entail finding it in auction houses??
06>v>
07hah
07checkmate
06Doesn't need to be an auction.
06It's called a trade.
/me checkmates kyu, but ends up getting sudden deathed instead
06And Faerie PB trades are NOT hard to find.
Yeah, but Kyu better be rich as heck or else he's not going to find a deal.
GENESIS
06I would buy it myself, but I only have around 600,000 NP.
06Rounded down, of course.
06=3
06But still.
>.>
...Ever hear of a bank?
06=v=
06That's where the NP is AT.
XD?
Just go and be one of those straw hat millionaires.
07i may have 9 million but there's still no way i'd ever spend a third of that on someone who isn't me o3o
06What? >v>
06You can't just simply change your account to the highest level.
06You need an initial deposit.
06Or whatever.
06You need that much NP or more for it. >v>
06Besides, the interest is only about 176 anyway.
/me checks
06No, 175.
07oh wow
/me spent some money today, "Account Type: 	Diamond Deposit Gold Current Balance: 	635,138 NP"
07my plushie brush doubled in price since I checked last
07o3o
Neopets was just... like, not good.
06If you hate it that much, than don't talk about it or something, lawl.
o
06Wait, I has NP on me.
06Only 876, though.
Funny thing is, it's a decent game, but luck was absolutely brutal. Like, nothing went right.
06Blaah, I have no choice.
/me puts her extra Striped PB up for auction TvT
06I could always buy another one when the time comes anyway.
06Lawl.
0699,000 NP for two days.
06That should do it.
07why do you even need one if you're not using it lol
06For if something ever happened to my Xweetok.
06Like, if she was hit by a random event turning her into a different type.
06My Bori was turned Baby once.
12cynder is talkitive o-o
06UMBREE.
06I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
06http://pimpanime.com/internet/naruto-shippuden.html << ENGLISH.
06=D
12forget english
06There are only four episodes on it, though.
06Where are they getting them from? D=
06I've been checking the adult swim schedule for if they ever plan to air Naruto Shippuden on Satuday nights but don't have commercials for it yet or something.
06*Saturday
07Naruto isn't Adult Swim lol
06I know.
06But it's anime, and actionish.
06=D
/me misses Toonami TvT
06Even if they DID only show the original series. >v>
12night everyone~
/me pokes Quan

07Cynder
07Beginning in October 2009, the English dub of Naruto: Shippuden will air weekly on Disney XD
06...
06DISNEY?
06WHAT?
07not normal disney channel
07disney xd
06But it's still DISNEY!
06D=
06That SUCKS!
/me slaps herself
06Mood swings.
06D=
07what difference does the channel make if you like the show?
06I hate Disney.
06In every way.
06Except sarcasm.
07so?
07Naruto isn't made by Disney
06So it's not worth it.
06Unless Hidan appears soon.
068D
06Then again, I COULD just watch records of the English episodes online when the time comes.
06So..
07....
06It's NOT worth watching the channel.
06D=
07well that's just dumb
06No.
06That's just awesome.
07hardly
06I can skip the lame, non-Akatsuki-related scenes~
06=D
06And commercials, if they don't cut 'em out.
07it's still dumb to not watch something just because of the channel that it's on
06So?
7Nyaaaaaa~n
/me 7pokes Skull_Latiwolf o3o
06X3
6 18:46	Kyu	Naruto isn't made by Disney <- O-----o;;
6LATIWOLF?
07so why not watch it if there is no logical reason
6I know what that is
/me 6runs
7o3o
/me 7declines politely
6also, Kyu
6pm
/me declines impolitely inb4 invite
6comin ur way
/me is shot
07'i don't like disney' isn't a logical reason if Naruto isn't owned or created by it
07and k, Roara
7Okay, question:
07in fact
07most of disney xd is non-disney created shows
7What angle's supplement x 2 = 5 times the angle + its compliment?
06...
06Uhm...
06It's called Google, Quan. D-
/me is brick'd
06*=D
7I tried it algebraically, and got -45. O_o
06I wanna sprite something, but whut? X3
10Gtg, cya
6me
7Sprite a rock. :P
7Heeeeeeey, Rora. X3
06..
7Y'want me to put my sprite of you up on dA?
06A rock? XD
7Now, y'see, the equation is this: 2(180-x) = 450 (which is 90 x 5)
7But then it becomes 360 - 2x = 450, or -2x = 90
7So I get -45 degrees as an answer. :/
/me 6got some paints today <3
7I don't get it. D:
07that's not right
7Eh, Kyu?
072(180-x) = 5(x) + (90-x)
7Yes, but the problem was vague if 'five times the angle increased by its complement' was that that way or this. o3o
07well this way comes out non-negative
07besides
07multiplication first

04:/
04I can't wait for SS and HG because i never got to play the originals, but i just hope they don't kill them...
6You should buy Crystal somewhere
6it is truly the top of all pokemon games
6while I don't think HG/SS will kill it, they wont be the best
/me pokes Crystal Rom
04I have Crystal, but mine can't save, and i never have the to play all the way :O
6cant save?
6as in, the battery died?
6we have a walkthrough on how to fix that so you can save again
04Maybe... :/
/me pokes Crystal Rom more
6PS, when you turn it on, does it say anything about the internal battery running dry?
6or being corrupted?
04Nope. All my other games can play fine and what not...
6doesn't matter what the other games do
6this is a GSC strict issue
04I'll have to look into it some more to get more info.
6because of the day/night changes, the battery runs dry rather quickly (they started dying out a few years ago)
6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=2348.0
6go grab your game and turn it on

06Bai, -
06D=
2bai NS D:
/me searches for interesting ones
6Silver's theme, cynder
6SILVER'S THEME
6:|
06No.
6it is awesome
6as always
06It says GOLD'S THEME.
6..
6I'm calling it by the real name
6by THAT name, it's Rivals' them
6theme
6so....RIVAL'S THEME
6:}
Where be Aerooooooooo.
07eh?
06Barely different.
2and where do you think they were modeling the remixes fr=or D/P/Pl
07the gender you don't pick isn't a rival
2*for
07it's still Silver that's the rival
6..
6Kyu I know
2Gold is the Hero
2Silver is the Rival
06Not always.
6Gold is the name the uploader used for the guy, as that's his name
2Crystal is the chick that just comes in
07Gold is silly in the manga o3o
06That's going by gold. D=
6silver is ALWAYS rival
2apparently you can travel to kanto after you beat the game in SS
2XD
6Silver is <3
06And HG.
2yeah
06XD
2Cynder, read the manga :P
07he carries around a pool stick and flies on a remoraid-powered Mantine
07o3o
06Pichu Encounter.
06>v>
2I have read just about every manga for Pokemon
6too much drumming in pichu encounter
06Unown (Radio).
06<3
2Aurora:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HRKp2alHj8&feature=related
6EW
6EWWWWWWWWWW
6EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
2watch that
07http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/series/363/pokemon_adventures/
6EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
06They barely changed the original version.
2I will try finding a site, I have them irl, but I have no idea where to find them online
/me always loved it
6Unkown radio was keeled
06I was always afraid of it.
06XD
6simple as tat
2xD
06-k
06It's Unown.
06:P
6they screwed up the instrument, and it's not as scary
2Unowns be awesome :D
6and thank you kyu
2I liked how sinple the Pokegear was
2*simple
06It's scary enough when you're all alone in a dark room. :P
/me IS
/me gives Cynder a Hidan
2a phone card, a time card, a radio card, and a map card
/me glomps
06The map card was optional.
2yup
2still awesome to have though
06That stupid little old dude.
06I wouldn't need it.
2I got it for the royal heck of it
07Cynder, sythesized piano does not make for scary no matter what the situation
07XD
06If they don't display the routes in boxes like they normally do, I'll just use Fly to look at the map once I can use it.
06They probably WILL use the boxes, and I already know my way around.
/me sits all over kyu FIRST
07but there's a line D=
06I'm not going through such a stupid little tour that points out the obvious for NO reason. D=
2it was madefor new players
2for them to figure out the area
ther was no line =P
07besides
06Tin Tower and Burned Tower...
/me prefers Burned Tower
07the map is most likely going to be used to track roaming pokemon
06X3
2I liked burn tower
06Creepy.
2no
06Good point, Kyu, but still.
2that was the Pokedex
06They didn't do that in the old ones, remember?
06XD
2stupid legendary dogs <_<
07well they're not gonna go backwards like that
06Frontier Brain Battle.
06XD
2xD
06Barely changed the music from D/P/Pt.
07if you haven't noticed, the pokegear is gonna be the 2nd screen again
06X3
12lol
2ewwww
06Yay, it'll be like the Poketch.
07well what else will go down there?
06Uhm..
2...
2no comment
06Your party?
06I don't know.
06XD
07there was a poketch app for that
07besides
06XDD
2o_O
06Ovo
06G/K/R battle.
07the big difference between the poketch and the pokegear is that the pokegear doesn't look retarded
06Groudon/Kyogre/Rayquaza Battle.
07http://www.serebii.net/heartgoldsoulsilver/pokegear.shtml
06Huh, only slightly remixed from the third generation.
06Dissapointing.
06TvT
06Oh, they display the specific Pokemon icons?
/me is gonna catch Raikou with a Master Ball, no doubt~
06I want him on my first try.
06=D
07well that's lame
2I want Suicune
2she is awesome
07do real work for your favorite
06Nuh.
06I want him before I get lazy and give up.
2I used fast balls on them
07don't dishonor it by not letting it battle
07o3o
06Besides, I don't want to hurt him.
06D=
06Once I catch him, he'll become my replacement starter. XD
/me 6loves the chase
06Just like how Chomp replaced my Torterra as my starter in Platinum.
6it's rather thrill pumping to chase them around
07it's not really a replacement starter
06Master Ball is the rarest ball of all, I want Raikou to be in it. D=
07more like a starter replacement
06XD
06Lawl.
06Whatever.
07a replacement starter would be a new starter
07o3o
07master ball is also 'oh pfft. she probably hacked that pokemon'
07or hacked the master ball
07or both
6lol
/me pokes everyone
07in Cynder's case, both
/me runs
06Who's your favorite Gym Leader? =D
06Mine's Clair.
06She pwns.
06:P
06He sprite pwns more than she does, though.
2!greater Cynder Kyu
Cynder < Kyu
06D=
2lawl o.o
07I like Jasmine
07although she looks too easy to beat this time
6I know
6especially with Quilava
2I love Kogas team
/me burps

6I usually train up all my others
2hm..

04Thanks
02Hm
04I am mad
12hi mad
10Awesome
04No, do NOT be sarcastic
04You know that avatar I made?
04it doesn't meet the f'ing requirements for dA
04And I worked DAMN hard on it
12isn't it 50x50?
10i can make it 50x50 if that's the problem
04It's 40x40
04It'll probably ruin the quality
04Besides, it's an animation

12I AM SOOOOOOOOO TIRED
Of noobs?
Why?
/me cuddles the blue birdo
Or just in general?
Can it be cured with tea?
welcome home
6Arti <3
/me 6does NOT want to have to pay this ticket >_<;
12Tea NEVER works no matter how much I drink, and I have STRONG tea XD
/me snuggles all
/me snuggles back. "Oh, Arti... I have new laptop!"
And it is nice... if huge.
And vistay... ick.
6o-o
12Put Windows 7 on it
6lol
I will on October 22nd ;)
6why oct 22?
that's the release date?
6oh!
6lol
I can't, yet... but I get a legal win7 licence.
Upgrade program.
6LOOL
6you burd
I just have to send my proof of purchase to HP.
Or rather, the company they contract it out to.
12What should I have for dinner.. hmm
I just had apple pancakes
14Fish and chips sounds good
14Aurora! where's the colour!
/me runs
6I was supposed to do that when I was on at midnight >_<;
Chips sound too fatty.
14Ah
14Fail
6lol
14And Vyl, your point being? XD
6feesh and chips sounds amazing right now
14Chips are always good
6as does everything else
6asdfghjkl
Jacket potato... topped with tuna feesh!
6except that o-o;
12I really love that, but I HATE making tuna, mayo and onion..
14Food in general sounds good right now x_X
6my life revolves around food I swear
14XD
erf
14I might raid my freezer in a bit
12Sometimes there are benefits to living with your parents, my mum always prepared the tuna fdor jacket tatos
14My mum makes me cook my own food
14XD
14Screw it, food is neeeeeeeeeeeeeded
14brbrbrbrb
6lol
hrm - I don't think I ever ate jacket potatoes oO
I'd do the potato. Even if it is a bit more effort. Got tuna?
14Jacket Potatoes are good with cheese and mayo :>
14I know what I'm having, Square Sausage, Bacon and Egg Sandwiches
12I have tuna yes
12But I really hate making it
12I might just go with beans and cheese
That works too.
Not as nice as tuna, but... close.
And next time shopping, get cottage cheese :>
12I'm not a fan of that one
the much I'm a fan of cooking myself - sometimes I just pick some deep-frosted meals^^
hi arti
12Yeh sometimes I'm way too tired to cook as well, that's where Xai comes in :3
12and if neither of us want to cook, then it's TO THE FREEZER
6LOL
2hi Arti and Aurora
6ok crud, class
6bbl
07Articuno?
07Or anyone else familiar with video editing
07o_O
07How can I work with MPEG-4 files?
07Windows Movie Maker refuses it :>
videolan will play them.
07Vyl I know what will play them
07But I want to edit them :>
07As in compile every little clip I have into a movie, but they're MPEG-4 XD
http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html
download this and run it
that way you can convert the movie into ANY format you wish
I'd use avisynth, but it's fiddley.
Lots of setup
07Ok thanks ^^
07and Vyl I'm not out after fancy options really, I just want to be able to have basic functions
I don't know any basic ways to do it. Only avisynth.
12Damn I havent played DDR in ages
AGH.
STUPID HP!
/me gives Articuno 2 quarters
I overwrite my Vista boot sector... intending to just put it back again.
Have fun
12HAHAHAHA YOU GOT A HP
12You fail
But no... HP's 'repair' utilitity is triggered.
And it just disabled Vista, and insists that my laptop now needs to be reformatted.
But if I can't run Vista, I can't fix HP Recovery Manager.
07Probably me being lame now but I can't find the download link XD;
oO
http://www.erightsoft.org/GetFile.php?SUPERsetup.exe
I summon geek-power.
??
No, that didn't work.
I was trying to do something sneaky around the HP junk :>
Nope. It's locked itsself down.
The software is programmed to prevent any repair other than that HP authorises.
/me nibbles someone's ears.
07that is
07excellent!
that's what I also think, yeah
drat. I gotta get going guys
cya
you can even convert flash movies to avi files and so on
07thanks a lot ^^ and woah o_o
or extract music from youtube-movies
07it took me a while to figure it out
07it seems rather complex :> so many options!

I was showing Tobi this awesomely awesome heartfelt book I read a few years ago at the library and wanted her to read it, but it was too short for her taste. So that's when I said: Reading that small book is like eating a chocolate chip cookie. It's small, but it's simply delicious as you eat it. And when you're done, you want more. Or, the taste stays with you for a while.
I think that probably cut off for some people. XD

lol
03Um...
03I dunno, I have a problematic sleeping pattern myself. :$
12lol
12exactly
12tell me what not to do
03Stay up late on the PC.
03I've done it for the last two nights and it's been a mess the next day.
02o.o
12lol
10.-.
03Also, if you have an MP3 player or iPod, listening to that can help you get to sleep early.
03Not so much if you've got full beat music like Metal, just have something that's comfortable, like a piano piece.
02o.o
03Dinner should be relatively early as well, not like at 9 or 10 PM at night, and it might not be such a great idea to have coffee at this time.
03And finally, your clothes should always cover your kneecaps, and keep your manners and your utensils nice and tidy within your house.
03LOL! I sound like a pommy nanny. XD

04In a battle between Drake and him, Darkfire would probably win
04But only just
02xD
02Well
03Yeah, he wouldn't manage to keep a Paul's Iced Coffee no matter how hard he tried.
02I haven't revealed his abilities

04And I posted

02But Draconis is awesome
02Should wait for the others
02So I'm not going to post
04Neither
02xD
02Draconis would pwn both of them though
02But I had to weaken him for the RP lol
02XP
04I know
/me runs and goes to maybe troll
04I think Draconis is just plain unfair
02Now where's that OTHER proxy

Wait. If you had to weaken a character for an RP, then you KNOW something is wrong.
/me pokes TRoR
02That's different, Drake
02Draconis is more powerful in there
04Yeah, but he's still overpowered even for that

Apple products!
Hell no
03:O
Oh come on
2o.o
2lawl okay
/me gives Dragrpyhon a. xbox 360?
Apple products are overpriced, they also tend to be pretty difunctional and stay that way until ASpple's literally sued for it. Then they fix the problems only to cause more. Rinse, repeat
And yes, that would work, as long as it worked XD
03xD
03And Microsoft is better how?
2screw the prices I have money
/me shot
I never said Microsoft is better
I'm just saying that at least I could use the 360.
2xD
/me holds up her cellphone, See this? twenty bucks. Doesn't overheat, I can do what I want with it, and I have flexible plans. Oh, did I mention it actually WORKS?
2O__o
/me pokes teh cellphone with a stick
/me avoids
2fail xD
03Well, I like Mac OS.
03It's good, and their computers are good.
MACs are alright. But I've never liked them.
It always felt like baby's first computer.
2Never used a mac before :o
2but heard of it :P
03They're pretty good but you have to know how to use them.
03And if you're really technical and you dont like the OS, use Boot Camp and run Windows instead. :D
2great idea
2but that would require a seperate partition
No thanks XD
Like I said, not a fan of Apple and such.
03Indeed, but it's not hard to make a separate partition with boot camp.
03And while the pcs are expensive they bloody have enough tech in them to beat the rest.
03I'm still seeing Vista laptops with processing power JUST on 2.1 Ghz.
I like how people go "Oh, hey, you can play games on a Mac! All you have to do is run this thing that will emulate Windows/create a secondary partician to run windows/etc etc etc" Ummm, no. You're still using Windows and not the Mac itself.
2o.o lawl
/me rofls at the video 'its hilarious'
hi Drag
03Clearly you have never heard of WINE, Dragy. :P
Hello Star

very
Only slightly
12the fact that you turned on lightning
this is a very active night-
6o---o-
o_O;
thats funny.
04Bbs, phone
I never turned on Lightning, we're still good friends
04lol nvm
04back
I was just upset that she moved her chatroom from Sneas's channel
04hi Luna
kk
wb
A lugia?
Heya Alt!
Hyoomin?
04hiya :)
12so you're saying lightning should of stayed in snea's channel
04wat
12and continue to be treated like crap from him?
02brb, gotta shoot my dog
I'm saying she shouldn't have up and left without consulting him first
12if you were being treated like crap i'm sure you would not even think of staying
What's Luna then?
Lightning meant a lot to Sneas
And he was so proud to have that chatroom for her
kk
Glacy, Lightning said to Sneas that she was never his friend.
12i wouldn't befriend someone who treated me bad either
I'm friends with Sneas and he doesn't treat me bad
12okay so sneas did all this stuff for her, that doesn't give him the right to treat her badly afterwards
Please don't insult my friend like that
...
ugh
6well, I'd personally say move this topic off of Main, but that's just me

Feather and Umbreon when they aren't Vhosted
just add their nicks

04[15:42:09] * Kyu sets mode: +b *!*@dyn.centurytel.net <-- Feather: some guy called "lol" spammed here :U

07you're out of the loop

04Apparently I am.
07this has been going on for almost a year
04I was too buisy making hair texture.
!lag
04What, Josh or Feather acting annoying or what?
The irritating one is removed.
the spam.
07her brother
04Kthnx.
04Yeah, I don't understand him. :|
I've kicked him off the internet for ten minutes :>
how? :|
07lolwut
04QUESTION.
haxing?
04Anyone here have 3Ds Max?
04'Cus I need help.
04K.
Quil, whoever is on the end of that IP, their security is laughable.
04Do you have Collada plugged in?
Nope.
06Fail, the forums blocked the word "arse" which is dumb IMO because there are worse words :/
12lolz
lol
10I've kicked him off the internet for ten minutes :>
10o_O
10LOL
07lolut Vyl?
lolhaxing
just don't do anything too illegal >.>
07wouldn't that affect Feather too?
04I need someone to convert this .DAE model I have into a model type that has bone support and can be ran in Milkshape.
04:<
and yeah.. their Ip is... like the same.
Shared connection?
It is the same.
Yeah,.
I'll let it back on then.
I believe.
Done.
04If you could block off his comptuer that could work, in theory.
04But
04cannot happen.
Feather could restrict his computer >.>
Feather could steal his HDD
8D
HDD + sledgehammer 8D
12lolz
04Lawl
Yeah, but I'd have to access it.
And get the program on there.
Feather can do it for you
Which is how Feather can help 8D
she got LMI on there once
04So Vyl
and I had fun screwing with him
04You think you can halp me?
04My buddy S is buisy and I don't wanna desturb him :<
Nope. I've never worked with that.
Vyl, explains to me how you do these thing.
I know no more of it than you do.
04No
04I mean
04I just need you to open the .DAE file
You don't have 3ds?
04then export--> a file type that has bonez
04I have it, but...
04It doesn't work.
04At all.
04;_;
04And blender sucks (No, I mean it. It doesn't load the dang file)
oh hey Vyl.. I have a random question since you're here

bees dying ftw though
12stung is past tense, tho :\
04...
04DRF
04Just because they sting doesn't mean they aren't importaint.
12as long as those bees stay AWAY from me... x-x
04Without pollinating flowers there'd BE no flowers.
zomg what would the world do without roses
/me runs
07you mean BEE
I don't really care
04Which means lack of Oxygen compared to right now.
/me shot
12bees aren't the only creatures that pollinate flowers...
yeah
BEES~!
and still, I don't mean go kill bees worldwide, but if they interfere with humans than sprayign them ftw
04Yes but they do it really well :P
12true
12but they're not alone :\
/me wonders if there are any other 2Sense listeners in here
042Sense..?
12thats why Bee Movie is a LIE!

12I'm getting them too
12I would have gotten one more, but I'm allergic to it, lol
6o-o;
12but it was for something else
6I had the second chicken pox immunization (when I was young, it was only one, but these days it's two) and I don't remember the second I got
I actually had chicken pox so there was no point in me getting the shot...
12lolz
06Same as drf
6lol
12I haven't gotten the Chicken Pox yet o-o
04Lawl.
6there was a point that we thought I had chicken pox, but to this day we have no idea what it was
04Josh was asking me how to ghost people.
04I think he wants to ghost Arti or something. :U
6I only got like 3 dots, itchy and red, and we were very sure they weren't bites
04How desperate >.>
12o.o
14LOL he couldn't ghost anyway

06Hi Shiny!
04How.
04Pathetic.
04This kid is trying to get me to tell him how to ghost.
04He says his sis took his nick >.>
Skylands, you remind the IP address. XD
Hey Sky
07lol

07like he's even allowed to have a nick on here
Kyu
6lol
other server
07lol
07k then
aparantely he's claiming Feather took over his comp
and was spamming
04right.
14He's a pain in the ass
04He knows Feather's password.
6I would to that as revenge on him, but I don't think feather would
12lolz
6amazingly
lol
04So he acts link he's Feather to tick us off.
6she needs to change her password to something he doesn't know
04>_>
07she did
6or has she done that?
6oh
07just today lol
6>_<;
04Not on MSN
04XD
07lol
07i figured
04HAHAHA
04He said I gave him the idea to be annoying.

12o.o
grrrawrsnarl
04Honey bees may be extinct by 2035 T_T
6I heard about that
07wild, or all?
04Someone said that mancind is trying to get more out of the bees thsn they can offer.
04ll of them.
04It's called Colony Collapse Disorder.
6heard of that too
04Through these 26 years I hope the cause and cure will be found.
04Why not put an X-Ray with a camera next to a freakin bee-hive? >_>;
6???
04To see the bees as they die.
04Which might help find a cause.
6well, note that X-Ray is radiation
04...Crud.
6hence having lead-base mats to protect you
04Night-vision camera?
6...
6how can that see through wood?
04:S
04Put it in the wood.
04I mean hive.
6I'm sure stuff like that has been done
07tons of bees die from things not associated with the disease though
6to test what kills them is more complicated
CCD is a mystery. Disection turns up digestive failures.
04Glass hive? T_T
But no apparent cause for it.
04...
07Vyl?
04Digestive failures.
04****.
Yes?
07Quilava wants your attention
12o.o
04I did
/me gives Quil its undivided attention :3
eep?
04Bleh just in panic a little bit.
04:/
if all the bees die we'll have to find a way to fill their functions in society
i.e. more jobs
two birds with one stone
!
(sometimes I impress even myself)
10Yeah, we just need some way to decrease our size by a lot.
/me 6divides LL's attention
10Excellent idea.
i don't think it's a matter of human population
as it is a matter of improving production methods
/me is now looking at Quil and Aurora o-o

6anyhoo

07WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON CHANGING YOUR REAL NAME?
07LIKE LEGALLY?
07JUST CURIOUS
/me sighs...
10o_O
I'll bbl
10Depends on the reasons
07lol asd
07i didnt realise i allcaps'd
10Like changing your name due to an obsession would be downright retarded.
10If you have a reason i guess it's fine
07Well
10To a certain extent of course :P
6lol
07or toyger? a cat person lol
10what
10Like what? Someone named "Ima Dork"? *flees*
10i don't think so
07she addex 'zuno' to her real name because she thought 'silje' was too ordinary
10No, i thought of the norwegian kid trying to change name to "Sonic X"
6If someone had a name prone to humiliation as some parents do to their kids, then fine
07a friend of a friend
10true story, and ovo
07LOL
6but I don't like the fact you can change your name
07what happened to them?
10to who?
07the sonic x kid
07LOL
07Aurora, why don't you?
10He got rejected for underage + copyright infringement
07Loool
10but he got to meet King Harald so whoo
07why on earth..
10idk
07why the king LOL
07But yeeah
10attention!
10that's why
07Actually for years, I've contemplated changing my name
10i guess it was a cute story, and oh?
07Not removing ym first name, but adding to it
6adding to it is fine
07Maria Dolores is my birthname
6I don't support a full change
07Why not Aurora?
6Like someone named Lauren changing her name to Lisa
10The most regular ones are adding and changing surname when getting married and such though.
07Yus
07What do you guys think of my suggestions though?
6just....if your parents gave you that name (unless they were drunk, stupid, both of the above, or you just didn't want anything to do with your parents), respectfully you should keep it
Aparently one of our teachers changed their 1st name noel to leon(which we knew him as), but I doubt it cause he didn''t do anything about his middle name valentine
10lol
10mhm
07[00:05:07] <Aurora> just....if your parents gave you that name (unless they were drunk, stupid, both of the above, or you just didn't want anything to do with your parents), respectfully you should keep it <- well
07I was given the name Maria Dolores at birth, then my biological mum abandoned me at an orphanage
6and with my explanation, if the reason for the change falls between the parenteses, by all means
07when I came here, I was supposed to be named only Kathrine
6do what you wish
07but my parents ditched Dolores and kept Maria
07so LOL
6hmm
10that sort of changed the situation tbh
07Yar
07well, I dont know about adding Dolores, would like opinions
6lol, if I changed my middle name to be "Aurora", no one would be able to tell based on initials XD
04..What happened to Feather? :<

hawkeh
goon

6Dolores is pain and sorrows
10yeshai

And your drawings don't suck ^^ Just keep practicing
I like the shading
since I cannot shade all that well T.T
02My drawins fail too
bah I'm sure they don't
04Well, im not to good at drawing either, but meh.
to me, a person's drawings who fail is if they are too prideful of their art
and remember, it isn't how good the drawing looks
it's the power it holds :3
power=it draws one's attention
O.o oooo

Imma be honest

are you talking about all people? or just a certian age range?
huh
...Racism really is only for idiots. :/
no wonder he hates them
well Im not racism
I'd believe you if you were talking about a specific age range, but then I'd bring up how EVERYONE really sucks at that time.
12it is as long as you refer the people you hate as "black people"
yeah
...You're annoyed at all black people for something a small group of people did.
12trust me not all black people are like that
like in high school, everyone can pretty much just go die. they're all terrible
12and i know a lot of white people who act just like the people you are referring to
my sister is white and she act like rap black people
go london you will se a lot of blaks
lol
nah
i got my stupid sister

Black people want have Revenge on White people

Little hole on the CD drive... insert paperclip, it opens.
/me petpets Arti
Nope.
My computer does, not my laptop
Why can't you power it up and eject?
If the laptop can't be fixed, just stick something in there and wrench it out, lol.
/me 4puts arti on foopets
It's so old, it suddenly powered off. I've been charging it for two days but it won't turn on.
Tried taking out the battery and running it on charger only?
o-o
No. My dad would get mad >>
2back
It might be the battery failed, and that's keeping it from turning on.
4plug it in
Wth is the perfect tense of "go out"
gone out?
If it helps, it went out right when I plugged the mouse in.
Maybe the motherboard overheated. O_o
Eh, I dunno.
I'ma go check on it,
Oh hey, cool. My dad took the battery out.

07It's entirely up to you, I'd REALLY appreciate it if you could try, but as I said, it's entirely your choice!
But I can't guarantee anything. I'd love to send it to you, I hate i-Pod's anyway.
I have no use for it.
07Just the thought is really appreciated. ^^

but shes on wc3
6Ah
/me squeaks.
07Hello
meh my user there is frostdragooon... on there..
6O:
for a sec thought she was on here...
07Has anyone seen Cynder today?
6lol
I haven't seen her at all for a long time..
03LOL, too bad there's no !seen system here
03At least I don't THINK anyone has one
03!seen Somebody
meh... anyway... i shoulda guessed she wasent on here.... she wouldent put a number on her user...
03yeah no
whowas works too.
03wtf?
i don't learn Latin becuase northern schools are too hard to bother with poncy classical studies
03and LOL at this kid in front of me watching ESPN sports during this lecture
03I'm only using IRC, that's not nearly as bad
/me hides
according to whowas, last time she was on was a week ago :/
that cynder is actully her >.> acts just like her seriously... even taimed her to like her adult form again
http://tinyurl.com/mg5geq
07I got her a new bleach game for her wii. I guess thats what shes been doing
6Nice
ah. :/
gaven her even well... she requested it since were say... mates now
03You should just get her a modchip
/me runs
6O:
03Like I left all my original games at home since my sisters were whining and then just burned copies of all of them
03and they work fine
tortures she enjoys as such... and well... perfer me as her master... but idk if its for real or for the rps we have...
i guess its for real
since every game i ask her to team kill she dose
07Dont know what a modchip is or does
6O:
also she gos on rampages...
killing all i point out...
or for her own pleasures
It allows a console to play copied, pirated and non-publisher-approved games.
6Lol
03It lets you play pirated games
03Yeah
03it saves money :) since you don't ever need to buy games
this includes gore
6O:
07How do you get one? Online?
03Yeah
03well there's a lot of factors involved
03and you do have to take apart the Wii :/
03but what's a lot easier is a DS flash card
03does the same thing for DS games, but no modding required
07Lol! Im sure it involves a bunch of stuff that I cant do. xD
03Yeah
03but does she have a DS?
03Oh wait, that's obvious if she plays Platinum
6Lol
072 actually
03LOL
03Same with me
03DS and DSi
03http://www.realhotstuff.com/supercard-onei-free-shipping-stock-p-458.html
03Out of stock though :/
03but for $28 it's like free games for life LOL
also almost ate dpx the 1st time i came here...
6lol
07She didnt want the dsi. She just wanted a newer DS. She said something about sometimes the mic doesnt work on the older one
but anyways... im feared by the whelps ^.=.^

Your IP changed
?
That's what confused me
hum?
wat u mean
The IP address you were using at FurNet is different from it is now
i should have said no :3 i could have had fun with this
wats ip?
Ask Quilava
erm?
2lol
o.o
2IP is the "address" that only one computer has
2some computers, however, have a "proxy IP," which is when the computer's IP changes every reboot
12yeah, that's irritating
2however, even this has its limits; the proxy IP /can/ be traced back to a host IP.
2... sometimes
:\ so normally i would fail at fooling kipi?
Hmm?
I actually have never memorized an IP address
12nor have i dude
I just /whowas'd you
I memorize bits of the IP range
cuz some of them are easier to remember than others
like Sky's IP
Me?

6sorta
or how will you determine who wins?
6whoever can follow the character designs, both appearance and bios, the best will be the winner
6having a detailed story helps me see that you understood the characters
6plus
6I hate having people enter meaningless entries
2I need to get my dog off the bed
2she's eating my plushies QAQ
6stories show that you actually put thought into it
meaningless?
O_O;;
dont let dogs eat plushies they are valueable D:

6I can't use mane and tail on its own though, as it kills my hair/fur
/me 2keeps it messy and uncombed
6makes it super dry
6so I have hydrating Herbal Essences usually
2Loreal Kid's makes mine squeaky unless I use it twice XD
6and if I don't, then I get some hydrating conditioner as wel
6so sometimes....I wind up putting like 4 things in my hair in one shower

sorry
2YAAAAAAAAY
6yup?
6no pro
6b
6difd
skye
Yes?
does she have a particular obnoxious
*boy
that she is annoyed by>
6lolno
2phah
6not that I put in there
:/
2my mom said that the 1/4-hour alarm on my computer (its a "voice") sounded really sad
i see that much...
6you can pretend
is there one? i didnt just want to make up someone
/me flees
hmmm
6it's not a major character changing thing
2so I changed it, and now it sounds both creepy and too... attempting-to-be-happy
2anyway brb
hmm
ok
6now, taking someone like Faith and making her some obnoxious, rebellious burd...
.-.
6THAT is major lol
2back
but i needed a way for her to join up with you so i chose the obnoxious boy one
2o.o
since she dislikes them
2o.o
6ok
/me flees
6the reason I said "not that I put in there"
6is because just this week she was telling me about this boy that is bugging the heck out of her at shcool
6so, nice timing
:/
hmm
would i be able to use the name?
6by all means
or a nickname there is for him?
2o.o
ooo wat is it!
6Jeff
6lol

6it's ok ^^

2lol
12wow my arm still aches lol
/me puts an icepack on Umbreon's arm
12oww
2o.o
>< another reason i asked is cause i shop at art and book stores and hot topic, and like not many other places
6I don't shop much
6only recently did I start, and its already a problem
6so I avoid it
^^
/me 6has a debit card now with quite a bite of money on it
XD
i had $1000
but i has like $400 now
so :(
hope that helps Umbreon :3
12nope
D:
also im putting faces in this. for example: 3: D:<
so far anyway
2hmm
2I found the old story I did for English
2o3o my teacher said I should continue it, actually
i wrote one story once
it was great, but it needs touching up
6I have alot of stories lol
I have tons as well, but I have a poor habit of not finishing stories completely
6huh
6that word has come up in this story quite a bt
6bit
Out of the roughly 120+ stories I've written, I've only ever completed 2 fully
6I forgot what the translation note said it meant
2lol
6 2 completed
6 1 almost there, and two underway
I have one of mine online
what word
I just have a habit of writting tons and tons, then all of a sudden I lose interest (or just have no more ideas to continue it)
? aurora
6the word that is your name
lol
6I play them like a movie, most often accompanied by my ipod's music
6but sometimes I'll write them down
Yeah I do that a lot
/me is confused now
One of the current stories I'm writing is one of those
6a few of the ones that havent been written do show up though in my art
6as I'll sometimes draw a scene from them
2XD
6g
its japanese for my name
6I just forgot what the translation as
6was
._.
6...
i looked up my name and thats wat came up
Jya then ki
6oh here it is
hmmm

spirit
2lulz
D:
6makes sense in the context of the story then
2I'd say "wicked tree"
/me = bad :(
2but what they're going for is- D: No its not
:(
/me climbs up onto Aurora's back and curls up u.u
?
6I don't trust those name translations
XD
2lol
6your name in japanese is whatever your name is here
^^
6only it may be pronounced differently
6in japan, my name is pronounced "Oroora" apparently
2ourora

07i usually wake up 30 minutes before class
12really?
6lol
6it takes over that time to even GET to my class
Is college hard?
6as of now? no
Kyu makes it sound easy
But everyone complains
6it's much like high school, with fewer classes and teachers that don't really care
XP
6I complain of my 3 hour polisci class as its.....3 hours
<.>
6and my art history class because I've taken art history 4 times in my life (dont ask why I took it again)
6but I use both times to draw and doo other stuff
6*do
XD
6Im fine with college, I just wish I had friends right now

6and I can't get over my barrier of shyness, which apparently has gotten worse since the last time I was in this situation
07i visited them in school only once o3o
6I visited them way more that you lol
6since my shcool started 2 weeks later, I went and visited them those two weeks
6only now, after I graduated, do I respect the school's security
<.> I've switched schools way to often to say I have many close friends
6it doesnt seem like much until you actually TRY getting in there when you're not suposed to be there
6now for something I haven't done in AGES
6on my tablet o3o
:o!
Whatcha gonna draw?
Is it a floof balloon?

Hi

6o-o
/me flops
07Ugh
6burd
6<
6<3
hey everyone
who died?
07<3 rora
07Hi
07o_O
07no one died o_O
O_o
6lol
im glad
07Im just tired...
6same
6 4 hours of zzz's
6woohoo
12lol
07Because I've realised, I am not enjoying talking too much to everyone privately
6o-o?
12awesome
07and Im just losing interest in talking to most (not all!) people because of various reasons that highly depend on the person
12THAT IS AWSOME
12WOO
6:/
07Rora, I have friends who pretty much think they're my best friend when I in return don't feel I have ANYTHING in common with them anymore.
07We used to
6I know that feeling
12lol
6I'm going through it right now
07how do you cope with it?
6well, I cope with it offline, as this is a real life thing
6I just try to ignore the differences now, remember the good times
6but truth is.....that hurts
02o.o
07Rora, yeah
6I've been used and mistreated by them, and yet....
6I find it impossible to say directly that we'r enot friends anymore
12Roara me too
6especially when one of them was my first real friend back when we were 4
07for me it's more of an online thing, I keep in touch perfectly with my rl friends or people I've met irl (such as arrow, Xeli, and some others who aren't on here) but online is becoming such a hassle!
07Hm
12lol
07Maybe it would be more appropriate to say they're not a close friend, or they're an acquaintance if you've drifted
07apart ish¨
6well it depends on what the problem is
07yeah
6I don't know your problem exactly
6so I wouldnt know the solution
12what hell
12fish evolved into core
07Ah well, it's just more of a 'what the fleeb to do' because you're stuck being friends with people who make you feel awkward for various reasons
07and rora
07I didnt manage to finish drawing that falcon
07though my spanish teacher saw it
12lol
6I saw your comment lol
12Hmm
6and I know the feeling about the awkward and all
07LOL
07yeeeeah 8D
Today is a good day. The plumber came to replace the kitchen tap, and I got most of the bunny-art done, and made the call to book MCSA exams.
07O_o lol
07random vyl
EvilBunny!
12Roara shall i Register form
6I can be rather cold, but my heart wont allow me to come outright and say we're not friends
6to anyone
07I always try to find the best in everyone
07It's such a curse and a blessing, and I usually do stuff that is on the expense of myself a lot of the time...
07this is one of them >_>; Because it's just.... what do you say to stuff like that?
02I want to sleep
02X_X
6that's me
6this is how I've been taken advantage of by those friends I told you about
6they know I do anything for friends...and that's gotten me into trouble with the
6them
07Ah, I can relate to that
07I've sorta been through the same, though I wasn't as much taken advantage of as much as I was tricked and being displayed as a fool and laughing stock for the public's amusement :>
07I can still relate thou
I find it hard to let anyone go, even if I didn't like them much ><
6yup
02well
02Need to go
I find myself looking through a list of people who have never really been nice to me, trying to find someone to talk to..

Kingdom Hearts 3 is yet to be a confirmed title by Square-Enix or Disney. It is therefore clear that there is no release date yet for the game. We have simply added this page in anticipation of there being an eventual title, and this will be the page to confirm a Kingdom Hearts 3 release date.

03Ew, Netflix's streamer uses Microsoft Silverlight
03I wanted something leech-able
hi Kipi!
/me tailwaves
star
12never did understand the point of silverlight
theres another star
/me is a llama
/me seems to have killed it
03it's just Microsoft's lame excuse of imitating Flash
03but some companies use it since you can't leech it like Youtube
03I have a 14 day free membership to Netflix that I used to get RapidShare, I'm gonna cancel it soon since I can't steal movies anyway >:/
lolol
03no really
/me chews everyone
03because 14 days is NOT enough to actually get the DVDs, copy them, and return them
03therefore since I can't leech the downloads it's useless
03But TrialPay is seriously hardcore
you can get them
it took me about 3 days to get my first batch of movies
03what it is is like... you sign up for a "partner offer' and they give you stuff for free
03so I picked one like NEtflix tha thas a FREE trial
03therefore it's free and more free
03then you just cancel the trial :P
hihi
ow....
03Xai, but you can't get movies, send them back, AND cancel an account within 2 weeks
I used my Amazon Prime trial
03if it was a month, maybe
that was amazingly useful
yawn
i could
03LOL
right.. and could someone explain why it does that?
hello
hello
because you're a fish
03but they don't let you cancel it until they get the movies back, or something
witchcraft
03whatever, Xai, at most I could get like 2 movies anyway
03and I can just use thepiratebay :P
12Ovo does what?
12(Quilava(?) <- ocean.lugia.us))) ?

The whole Lurkerman charade was to keep the peace.
oh wait....
Oh so Lurkerman was you Andy?
...
/me sits all over Aurora
Yep
forgot I'm done lol
6lurkerman was andy?
6kinda figured it would be someone we knew
lol
10lol
Yeah, Feather ruined my fun. Oh well, I was getting bored of it anyway.
When FL said that I'd be banned for being Lurkerman, I thought I'd play with him
6lolwut
You should have kept it to yourself. I was too late to say that.
But no hard feelings
I was planning on revealing it soon anyway
10I don't even think you can hide your identity on the cbox
Lurkerman is Lurkerman
04sorry testing something
03<Feather> I don't even think you can hide your identity on the cbox <-- can't you?
03I thought you could type whatever name you want
04ok awesome
04now back
04to hw.
6as far as I know, you're not ALLOWED to hide your identity
I was merely helping out with keeping the peace in there
07cbox mods can still see IPs
You can change your name to whatever on the shoutbox, but you-- yeah what Kyu said
03LOL
04some thought lurker was me :|
If any of you global mods would have asked, I would have PMed you and told you to keep it quiet
03Proxies FTW?
/me hides
03I wanna try it
Since I knew this would happen if FL or NS or another troublemaker knew
07besides
0739. Recently, people have been caught in the chat pretending to be someone completely new and different to who they really are. This rule has been put in to prevent deceit. If anyone else is caught doing this they will be banned. It is very serious to try and fool people in this way for whatever reason.
03LOL
ive returned...
It says "Chat," does it not?
03Well I'm the exception, since I never actually do stuff besides for fu
03n
07it says 'rules for chat,' but if people are gonna treat that darn box as a chat
07then it applies
Shoutbox =/= chat, as we've established.
6CHATbox
6as it has evolved into
6but, it's still the same
03nah
03it's a spambox
6lol
04+1
03I'v ecalled it a spambox ever since it was made
*senses dmb presense* uh oh
07'C' box...the C stands for chat lol o3o
My intentions with being Lurkerman were not to spam, but to remain anonymous and keep the peace
6which seemed to backfire quite often
03it stands for spam if you spell as badly as I do
/me hides
07Arti only labels it the shout box
03wtf
03it gives me an error
03I hate PHProxy though
Because she doesn't want it to be spammage.
Feather, I'm done in there.
03says Error :Bad return
03oh well :/
I was just saying you'd get demoted for telling me off to intimidate him.
He fell for it
6...
6well, I still stand by what's been said :/
6that place is already a timebomb
6no need to spark it
As I have said, I'm done in there.
07well technically the cbox wouldn't go away if he doesn't pay for it
07just no autorefresh
07frankly, i'd prefer that o3o
6I-d
6..
6ya
6I hate auto refresh
/me lies on Roara's belly
6also
6Kyu

wb Quilava

/me hides
It's against my lease. I usually do that stuff at home, like I pirated two movies for my Screenwriting class over the weekend
03I just use a VNC client to use the #P-O bot and run torrents on that
My Internet is also really crappy, as you can see in the Internet test topic

Yes I do know that game, have never played it.

You can get attachments for your home to run your home network through the electrical sockets.
i think i found the problem solver
so you dont need to run wires through the walls.
get a look at this... who here played okami?
Not me.
wow
anyway...
a user made his own nine tails
aka the dark lord from the game okami

/me 12puts a arm and wing around Vulcan.
/me 14yawns and flicks his tail back and froth slowly.
12DARI HAS A DS
12 8D
14^.=.^
/me 14rests his head against her.
Mccain woul have just gone an died, then you'd be left with Palin, and we'd all be screwed.
/me 12slowly begins to lick Vulcan on the back of his neck.
*shudder* Uhh, Palin.

12Oh god.

Yeah, bit he's old, so...
/me 14gives off a small dragon murr (can dragons murr? o.=.o)
12Yea)
14(good.)
6*lays down*
It's a mythical creature, it can do whatever you want it to.
I agree mostly with what Obama has done so far.
/me 12wraps her tail around Vulcans, and stops licking him, then lays on his neck.
/me 12stands up, a playful look on her face.
Shutting down Guantanimo Bay, pulling back the troops, looking into tax paid health service, etc.
/me 12starts to trot away, and looks back at Vulcan smiling, and starts going towards a tree where the moonlight doesn't blind you.
14-.=.o
/me 14gets up and follows quietly.
I've never come across blindingly bright moonlight before...O_o
12I did.
12Lol.
/me 12lays down against the trunk of a large oak and closes her eyes, and rests her head on the grass.
6hiding in a shadow watching them
12(Didn't I send you to a different dimension, and locked it? Or is that just me?
Wow, stalker much?
6i got out
12How?
14Me? I aint? o.=.O
14I dont stalk
12Not you.
So is locking someone in another dimension.
/me 14sighs and presses his paw against the ground, unearthing a pillar of Metal which raises himself up into the air about 15-20ft.
/me 14lays down and curls up, looking up at the Clear Night Sky.
What kind of metal?
14(btw for those who dont know, Vulcan is a Metal dragon.)
14(since the LoS doesnt say what metals there are in the game, it's just common metal.)
/me 12puts her wing on Vulcan, and lays down on his back.
14(Like Copper, or Iron or something)
12*lays down her head.
12*lays down her head on his back.
14o.=.o
12(O.O)
12(Lol Dari you have a DS?)
Lol, I'd laugh at anyone who decided that rubidium was a good choice of metal.
/me 14jumps a bit from not noticing her but quickly recovers and wraps his wing around her.
Yes.
12(Dsi or old version?)
Lite.
12(O:
12(I have a dsi
12(How'd you get on here on there?!
No homebrews for DSi, too man patcges.
12(O.O
12i have a pink ds lite too.
many* patches *\
With a flashcart
12Uhm
12you can get on mibbit just by downloading in the dsi shop on dsi "internet"
12and its free.
12;)
12Just suggestion.
So? Can you play any DS game for free?
:)
12Idunno.
I said I have a DS Lite. O_o
Not DSi
/me 12shuts her eyes again, and finally drifts off to sleep.
Don't forget to wear protection.*wink*
By which I mean a helmet, of course.
/me 14knocks against his Faceplate.
14I'm armored from Head to tailtip.
14Except my back.
14and limbs
Et amicus puelam amobat.
12what language?:
Latin
puellam amabat*
Vulcan: I think you missed the point if my joke.
Maybe you're too young to get it.
14I know what the joke was.
14i'm 17
Nevermind then.
Welcome to the club
14x3
/me needs to be 18 like, now
No one mentioned what I was insinuating, so I assumed.
I wish
I wanted to
12Et amicus puellam amabat latin
I know a few words, here and there
12Dang, you. "
I thought I saw one of your quit messages with Latin.
12o_o
Yeah
It is, and I know that phrase
Which is why I asked.
but that's almost the extent of what I know :\
12Anyone know polskich tutaj?
/me 14yawns once more.
14nope.
12Hmmm. Zastanawiam siÄ™, dlaczego majÄ… innÄ… liczbÄ™ liter na kaÅ¼de sÅ‚owo w kaÅ¼dym jÄ™zyku. o_O
/me 12snuggles up to Vulcan.
/me 12opens one eye, and it turns out its morning.
/me 12stretches her wings, tail, and limbs.
/me 12flares her nostrils and makes sure she isn't sick.
/me 12smiles.
/me 14squints and opens his eyes to find out it's already morning.
Wow, which planet do you live on for it to rotate on its axis in 30 minutes?
/me 14blink and looks around with a Yawn.
/me 12blows ice shards, and sculpts a pillow, and a blanket.
14The realm of the short equinox?
Lol.
/me 12breaks the pillow.
12"Meh"
/me 12drags the blanket over to a different spot and lays under it.
/me 14gets up and stretches out; opening his wings and curling his tail back.
14Figured as much. she's an ice dragonness.
12Yea.
12XD
12she is oddly always warm though
14Really?
12when people touch her she is toasty.
12 but she really is cold
/me 14places a paw on her lightly.
Oddly enough
I'm cold to the touch
12She can maintain her coldness.
but am usually warm :\
So she's cold, but warm...?
12She feels the cold on the inside.
12But hses used to it.
The opposite of a Tauntaun :D
12When other peoiple touch her, she is warm on there paws.
12*people
12*their
12Oh my gosh No.
12._. ..
12there.
12THERE.

/me 12blinks.
Touch her...

/me dies

I'm so awful ._.
Yes, you are.
/me 12makes a shocked face.
12YOU ARE ...
And so am I.
12THAT...
Curse you furries, corrupted my mind
Oh wai
t*
I am one
12JUST SOUNDED SO WRONG.
:3
12"touch her"
/me 14rolls over onto his back and stretches his legs upwards before rerolling onto his paws and hopping into the air, flapping his wings and hovering.
/me 12blinks confused.
/me 12flaps her wings and with one powerful flap she is already 10 feet in the air.
/me tries to flap wings but doesn't have any, falls over on his back, tail and ears twitching x.x
/me 12flys towards a field, of what seems like colorful dots.
/me 12skids to a halt.
/me flails and clings
yawns
/me 12puts him on my back, and flys towards the colorful dots in the large field where horses and cows roam.
Oh mai gawd, my leg is twitching o_o
I know, Vulcan, aluminium? Because you have to be light enough to fly.
/me clings tighter
14Titanium.
14x3
14Armor is titanium.
14not too heavy nor too light.
/me 12turns aroudn to glance at the wolf quick.
12*around
o.O
wolf?
14nor too thick or too thin. It's thick enough to be battle armor, but still gives him the ability to fly,
Who's a wolf ._.
/me has a thing about wolves <.<
/me 14gets bored and becomes clingy, following the two around out of bordem
/me 12thought he was a wolf ^^;
/me is no wolf o_o
/me is a collie/fox hybrid o_o
I wonder what Vulcan's melting point is, lol.
Always have been part fox <.<
32425 degrees kelvin
*3242.5

/me scampers around in the flowers 8D

God, I'm so gay XD
Yes you can, just not correctly. :P
/me 12sniffs a red and orange flower.
/me 12smiles.
/me 12takes it out of the ground
oh hell yeah, I have a 'zooka for my Zaku
/me 14swoops down towards the field before colapsing his wings in and skidding across the grassy area.
/me eats a flower
PETA
Lol.
/me 12walsk to Vulcan, the flower swinging back and forth in her mouth.
12*walks
yawns*
/me 12puts the flower infront of his feet.
14Aw. x3
/me 14picks it up and nuzzles.
Oh god
I have to fight Amuro o_o
x.x
Who?
A character in the game
What game?

Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs Zeon
I hate you all
Yay!
12O.o

My love has no limits
I know :D
/me 12gets close to Vulcan, and licks the side of his neck.
It reaches to Cuba and back XD

/me runsawayrealfast
stops drinking
/me 14murrs lightly and gives a lick back, wrapping a wing around her.
O.O

Nothing much
Councilors

Parents
Boyfriends

14Hmmm...is this love? x3

/me 12nuzzles him.

lol yeah
12Mabye? X3
Even -I- don't do it that fast
Dari: Mention the words Rape, Money, and Drugs
/me 14wraps his wings fully around her before nuzzling back again, placing his paws around her's.
And I'm shallow

I just like pointing it out constantly :P
Ok.

I'm never going to forget when he said that.
12Okay Vulcan do you have mibbit?

Mibbit makes me want to bleed my eyes out
14Nope. not yet anyway.
14I have every messenger except ICQ.

But then again, irssi isn't pretty, but it works
12Hum ok.
Vulcan: If you'd like to keep things as private as possible then I suggest you don't use Mibbit

I hate normal society :\
Therian?
/me 14gives her another nuzzle. <3

/me 12murrs, and licks Vulcan, and stops halfway through.

Therian
/me 12wraps her tail around his.

/me 12eats some grass.
and have made it into basically a cult :\
/me 12oddly likes it, because it is cold and has morning dew on it.

/me 14reaches behind himself and curls his tail up before removing his tail armor and wrapping his tail around her's.

/me shrugs

Yeah
It's fun, but Therians take it too far
12...

/me 4wakes up
04lol
/me 4looks around
12hai Quan~ (LATE)
04lol
ohai Quan
12You will not believe how angry I am right now
Why?
12Two of my databases have been corrupted or something
12By the host
12Including the backups they keep
o.o
03LOL
04O_o
03See, a cheap host woulda done the same thing, only for less money :P
12o.o
12and my site would never run either
04That's just great
12But anyway
04[sarcasm]
12I'm royally pea-ed off about this
03LOL
03Still, give me a list of stuff you want for a host
04I can see why
03and I'll look around
12*contacts them*
12DRF, you should have done this when I asked
03when did you ask?
12The past two years before last?
12Before I finally got a recommendation from someone else
This is why you should always keep your own backups
12I do
12TST is fine
12It's my knowledgebase that I just set up that's broken
04Hey LL
12and my gallery, which I have a backup of.. somewhere -v-
12But that isn't the point
12Point is they lost all my knowledgebase data
04Do you think that battles between friends on Pokemon should have better music?
12and gallery data
12and it could have been TST that was lost
12ummm...yes, 02 <late>
04lol
12and O.O @Arti
04I'm having trouble distinguishing you two apart
12...
12get used to it :\
04lol
/me sits near Lyon
/me huggles Max
12brb
04k LL
03anyway, o.o, I still don't see why you need some fancy expensive host
12I DONT
12Ffs
12Don't you get it?
12I havent found ANYTHING ELSE
12and YOU didnt recommend anything when I asked around for two entire years
12And then you go on about me choosing an expensive host
/me just backs away
12Well perhaps if you can find me a cheaper one that does the same thing, I WILL move, but what do you know about hosts? You don't use databases anyway
/me is hug-burnt a little
12You'd have no experience, you'd only have what's recommended by others like I had
/me pokes Veli to another channel
/me , the Core dragon of fire, even he can't stand up to Articuno the God of Ice when She's mad.
12and it's no good saying "Well this one is cheaper" because if the database connectivity is crap, I will NOT use it.
04Which one then Max
12I'd rather pay more for a crap host than use one that can't even connect to the databse
your pick
12back~
wb
04wb LL
12Ok, host just got back to me really fast
12"Hi
12Were restoring all databases shortly.
12If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to ask by replying to this email.
04Max, #Oblivion
12What a relief
12thankies~ <late>
03sorry, I was watching Family Guy
/me yawns
04wb Altair
haitair~
03what sort of databases do you use... MySQL or?
07they're not bears on unicycles! get them!
07XP
04urk brb
o-o
12Yes MySQL
12SQL is old and sucks
12o.o
12XD
03LOL
03well I didn't know which one you used
03LOL $1.95 for MySQL hosting
03I think that's ONLY the database, though, and not actual websites
03Hah, so get this
03you know that one I said was $4 a month, and you said it couldn't possibly be any good?
03It's highest rated on these sites
lol
03the ones that list hosts by user ratings
03so :P
i love it when people listen to music in different languages
03http://www.hostmonster.com/
12hai J~
even though they have no idea what it means
12<late> o.o
and that it means something vulgar :D
03LOL
J!!! :D
03like the song Gasolina?
LOL
07LOL Altair
12Right, how can I trust this host?
exactly
03how can you trust ANY host?
it's gasoline... right?!?!
/me shot
07like that one ad about learning english o3o
alteh
03It's got 5-star ratings on several sites I looked at
12Recommendation from someone who uses the database connectivity
like meh hawk?
03as I was also looking for cheap hosting
12Ok let me see if it actually has what I want!
that is epic win
03the funny thing is there's another one called BlueHost, and it's literally the exact same compsany
03*company
^^
Reeeeeeally?
12HA
i wouldn't say it otherwise LOL
12I wont use them thern!
seriously though
03why
12Already used Bluehost!
12guess what!
mohawks are epin
03just because they have two names?
03what
12They're the same as Powweb!
Thanku :3
03wait, what?
12The database connectivity SUCKS
12It doesnt load
12Ever
03BlueHost and PowWeb are the same company?
12No
03well I don't get this whole database connectivity thing
12I mean they're the same as in they both have the same problem
03the database is external, right?
np XD
03and then the site connects to it?
12Yes
12Well sort of
03so what you should probably do is
03get a separate MySQL host
03like this one for $2 a month
12That doesnt work
03then get a seperate WEB host
03... why not?
12Takes just as long if you connect outside the host
12Tried that too
03hm
12Cyberhost pro so far have only screwed up once on me
03maybe your databases just suck, not all the companies
/me runs
12Perhaps you should read the reviews from people who actually use daytabases
12Because I've been reading them for years and they're all the same
03LMAO "Price $1.99, regularly $9.99 a month"
03that's a HUGE discount
12Anyway if any company is connected to Bluehost, I won't touch them
03http://www.siteground.com/mysql-hosting.htm <-- actually
03these guys DO have webhosting
03I'll see if there are reviews of them
12*looks*
03I mean, any company call call themself "the best MySQL hosting"
03but LOL
12Give me about 10 mins to read through this site
03OK
03well I'll look up reviews
03hm
03there seem to be more bad reviews than good ones as far as databases go :/
12It doesnt tell me their full feature list. I want to see that, but either it's hidden on the site somewhere (which is a big mistake) or they just don't have it >v>
03but nothing related to how long it takes to load, just stuff like "it didn't work"
12That's because so many hosts don't do it right
03but that's because people are stupid
12Cyberhost pro does
03and that's why I generally don't trust reviews
03I try stuff firsthand
12Nah I've read through pages and pages of them
0330-day money back guarantees FTW?
12Especially Powweb reviews lol
03yeah but I mean you get all these idiots going "It didn't work!!! 1 out of 5"
03that's NOT a good idea of a product or company
03like, look up reviews for the Zune, most of them are really bad... but those people are all complete idiots
12They usually put your site on high priority in the first 30 days!
03LOL
12Thats what Bluehost did
03Well I think all webhosts do that, even the first YEAR
12Thats why we went with them, thought they were great! Then they turned into Powweb
03that's what Cirtex did to me
03the first year the site was blazing fast and stuff
12Well I can safely say that I've only had this one issue with Cyberhost Pro
03and then after I paid to renew it, it started hvaing more and more downtime and had dialup speeds
03PowWeb, now IT's going really slowly
07http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=4106.msg163885#msg163885 << LOL how off topic
03so honestly, I say the best strategy is to just keep moving from host to host, because staying with one will generally turn against you LOL
LOL
12LMAO
LOOOL
03that and cost more, since they all have "introductory" rates for the first year only
wow

07gah now the song's in my head lol
12^v^
04Ohai Kyu
12MJ is uplifting
04Lyon, I been whatching, if you guys want, you guts may go on I know whats going on :O
12you guts?
12XD
/me sighs
/me hides
04Ok PS, are you sure with that?
12drf: MJ was the molester, not the music!
03sigh, why can't I find one of those sites that has lists of hundreds of hosts anymore
/me hides
03LOL
04Yeah, though I'm typing up my most atm :P
04Ok
03these ones just have like 5 or 10
03I found a list of free shells that has like 100 sites that offer free shell hosting :O
04lol
03The problem is they're very limited... enough to make an IRC bot though
03I paid $22 to get a year of IRCD hosting... I just have to wait for them to bill me and set it up
03Articuno, what site do you use to read reviews of webhosts?
04meh
04k Altair

LOL that song
12XD
03Articuno, what site do you use to read reviews of webhosts?
12All sorts
12Any and every
12I don't have a specific one
12I try to read from as many sites as possible.
i can actually sing that song
and sound like mj
even with my voice o.o
03heh
03well you know what's funny?
12lol Alt
03for databases
04OMG! Altair is MJ in disguise!
12MJ is too low for me to sing XD
12LOL
/me flees
12*mostly
12DRF
03what
12me and Xai spend £400 on food a month LOL
12Just us two
03o.o why are you telling me that?
04:/
12Same reason you tell me all sorts of pointless stuff
03XD
03anyway: http://www.hosting-review.com/hosting-directory/top-10-lists/Top-10-MySQL-Hosting-Companies.shtml
12lol Arti
/me does the Thriller
04o-o
12o.o
03that site has "professional" reviews of each host, I don't know how accurate they are
12Host gator are up there?
12Thats utter crap
12rawr, Alt?
12I tried them for one month
/me hides
03Number 8
12as a trial
03well see
03but like I said before, I think it's hit or miss with ANY host
rawr, yes
12and they continued to bill me!!
03LOL
12Even after I requested they stop!
03that's how a trial works
03Oh
12AND they sucked!
03well then no
03but they'll always bill you unless you tell them in time
12Well I think the main problem with my host is how much I have to pay really..
12Because most of the time it's fine
03anyway, my point is... any site that hosts websites will do a good job. I don't think ANY host, short of super expensive ones, will be good 100% of the time
03Heck
03you know the bot we have for #Pokemon-Originals/
12No
03It's like a 1.5 megabit pipe
03no wait
031.5TB disk
03100mbps upload
031gbps download I think
03and I believe it's about $125 a month.
03Even that goes down
03like once a month
12I know
03so my point is: you can have the most deluxe account in the world, and it'll still suck as much as a $2 one
12Yes
03therefore, get a $2 one and save some money
/me runs
12But actually
12My account doesnt suck anywhere near as much as the cheap ones I've had so there
03until now.
03give it a few more months, it;'ll start crashing more and more
12Oh wow, three days of proper down time in over a year
03their support will start sucking more and more
03I've seen it before
12We'll see
03LOL
03Anyway, what I'm saying is, you could get just as lucky with one of the $4 a month hosts.
03Like, you might have bad experiences with one host, but there are plenty of peop;le who didn't, and gave it 5 stars
03PowWeb was one of the highest rated ones too
12Thats because few serious database users will use a host like Powweb :/
03why?
12Because it doesn't work!
03it's just another name, people have to try it first
12It just flat out does not work
03According to you, neither does half the rest of the internet
12Yeh, many people have, thats why there are so many reviews about it
03I still think it's because of how fricking huge your database is
03but there are lots of GOOD reviews too!
12If a host cannot support a huge database, what good is it?
12Good reviews from NON database users
12So what use is it to me?
03it's like me complaining about PowWeb because I have 20 DVDISOs on it and their servers are struggling to support it
03it's overloading the fricking system
12Ahaha
12Just shut up DRF you know nothing
03http://www.hosting-review.com/hosting-directory/editors_review/fatcow <-- wow, look at this
03this host has a 94%
03all the rest are in the 802
03*80s
12I'll check the site
12Ahh finally a full feature list thats easy to find.. >v>
03:O Today the dining hall has spaghetti for dinner
03I'm totally gonna go eat soon
03they close in half an hour >_> unless I want to walk to another dorm
12That host has pretty much everything I want but I'm not 100% sure so I'd have to ask them
03they have a live chat...
12Sounds a bit too good to be true however
03but meh, everyone has their stupid introductory prices
03I don't think I've seen like ANY host these days that has a one and only price, it's like "Sale!" and then after a year you pay twice as much :@
03PowWeb does that, even
12Yeh thats annoying but even the regular price is too good to be true
03is it?
03$7 a month or whatever seems average
12Thats how much Powweb cost
12LOL
03I know
12and they suck
03which is why I'm not gonna renew it
/me hides
03because I'm cheap
03and for me $50 a year is the limit
03I mean, I *could* spen2d more, I'm just not bothered

What ROM?
10Emu the bird?
/me shot
Emulators 8D
A HeartGold ROM that I got off HoR
looool
Which emu are you using
If you are using iDeaS then good luck
It's a rar file so the desmume thing doesn't recognise it T.T
LOL, .RAR files need to be extracted before you can use them
/me elsquish
:|
Extracted?
It's not i n a zip
*in
.rar is a compressed file
How do I extract it?
the same way you would extract a zip folder
...
wait..
No my mistake
hoagie lugia?
o.o;
It doesn't behave in the same way as something in a zip folder does when I double click it.
You'll need a program like 7zip, WinZip or WinRar to extract it
I recomment 7zip
NO I'M NOT HOAGIE
I'll get you a link
^^
o.o;
sowwy
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z465.exe <<< Download and run that, install it. once it's installed, right click the rar file and hover over 7zip, then click "extract here" :>
6gtg too bai
do you get that a lot?
I'm half Ho-oh half Lugia
Ah!
Why no Lugioh?
No I've only gotten it
Lugioh sounds like YuGiOh

roar
04Can anyone help out if you have time? I am not a very techy person when it comes to mIRC.
04I have looked on google but cannot find what I need - if anyone can help, please can you PM me?
07what do you need?
04Well, I have a new laptop and I am putting mIRC on it - but I don't know any scripts such as autojoin rooms, nick highlight, things like that. I have looked but all the sites I've seen are hard to understand. Wondered if anyone could copypasta the scripts or links to them?
who summons the dark one?
04Sorry for being a total n00b, been using mIRC for 2 years still dunno what I'm doing.
/me 14bows before Basil
14Me, Master.
and why?
04Hi guest
14Needed someone to Lighten Up this Dead Chat, Master.
07for autojoin, add the channels to your favorites list and enable join on connect
14And Also, you werent on for some Days. x3
04Yeah did that but when I go on furnet, it connects me to all the channels from here xD
07o3o
04maybe the solution is just not to go on furnet haha
4brb
14k.
07and nick alert is address book > highlights
04Oh, thanks. ^^ Just putting mIRC on my new laptop now.
07lolfail

04thanks Kyu
04My head hurts, I've been on rides at a big fair we have here.
04Now I'm watching Charmed. Useless information.
7I've been going on a large fav'ing spree. O.o
14Cause we care about you too.
14And I believe you care about us. >>
04Someone say my username please so I can see what it looks like - if you want? Never tried it out before. Thanks Kyu, I always thought it was some script.
hi

HALP
D:
PLEASE
03what
Uhmm... I'm finally at a computer; the one that can read my memory card.
03OK
03so what are you trying to do again>? LOL
So... do you think you can figure out what the problem is?
XP I'm trying to save roms onto it
Or change anything.
03open notepad, type "Hi" in it, save it as something .txt on that card
03see what happens
For some reason I can delete stuff, but I can add or edit stuff- including folder names.
03you mean can't delete stuff
03?
14-.-
14I knew he was gonna do that.
14So, i heard Cynder was in here the other day.
I can
03but you can't add stuff?
the notepad saved onto it just fine
o.o
03so that means you should have write access.
But I still can't pull in the rom
03o.o
03you can't rename folders still?
It crashed
-_-
Okay... I can rename folders now. XP
Dunno what changed
I still can't save roms though
Now I'm stuck in a PokeCentre with a Pidgey at my back and I'm FROZEN. Juuuuust great. >_>
03...
03try saving it to your desktop, then copying and pasting it on the card
03or... maybe it's full?
03Are you sure there's enough free space on the card for it?
3.25 gp of free space
Mine CRASHED T_T
543 used
543 mb*
03OK, try saving it to your desktop first
03and then copying and pasting to the card
The rom is already in Documents
03so what happens when you try to paste it in the card
03?

07hello
Hi
07I was just checking to see if I was able to get on here. For a couple of days last week it was telling me that this was an unknown site.
7dari lives!
7Oh jesus. It's abbery.
14HAI BB!
14xD
14Again.
7Dari, it's you. You're like a n00b magnet.
14And KJ.
7Hi BB.
14xD
7Go to hell, abbery.
14Go to heaven :D
5Go to the fruitcake bin.
14O_O
5:D
/me 14dies
7fruitcake tastes awful
5I know
14lol
5I just felt like saying something random
5XD
7... weirdo. :P
/me 5can't stop gnawing on her pencil even though she keeps taking it out of her mouth and mentally slapping herself..
14I officially hate Blink Levels now.
5Muh?
14rofl
5....Mmmm. Wood.
7could be taken, SO wrongly.
14lol Pencil yum
5Pencil-encil-encil.
5It's gonna end up looking like a retarded lump of lead and paper if I keep it up LOL
/me 5slaps herself
14LOL.
/me 7goes to find an appropriate branding iron
14Your pencil has lead? What the?
5Well, you know what I mean. Granite or whatever
5fffft
14xD
5I DON'T MAKE PENCILS, I JUST EAT THEM.
14XD
5And occasionally draw with them.'
14xD
7occaisionally.
5.
14Lol.
7abbey, what happened to TSCA? It was the one interesting thing about you.
5Something about this picture I drew is bugging me, and I dunno what. -slaps sketchbook-
5I wish it was summer again, and that I had access to DSL internet again LOL
7a bunch of people calling themselves RPers (honestly, one claimed to not feel pain and can never die. douchebags. except vulcan, I like him) come in occaisionally.
7Stacey rolled through yesterday too
14Oh yeah, them.
5Goodness
14I see material xD
5I hate godmoders
7indeed
5-facekeyboard-
14Ew, he claimed not to feel pain or die?
14Bull.
5fchddjsedgasdjkn
5Those people irritate me to the very core
7or even bloody looking hard
5....Wtf
14Lol.
5How does being an ice dragon allow for invisibility?
14Ice isn't completely transparent though.
7Hush, abbery. The people with IQs BIGGER than their age are speaking.
7BB: if you turn to the texture of ice, it would sorta work.
14Shush KJ.
5Sort of, but usually, natural ice retains at least some sort of visible distortion, doesn't it?
5Excuse me for slow typing, I had to correct about a billion typos trying to type fast,
5.*
7Yeah. Like I said, direct light, movement, or looking closely would ruin it.
5Never in my life have I heard of ice dragons being able to turn translucent or transparent like that, though I could just be lagging behind the general world community
5But, definitely, a soft focusing of the eyes and you'd probably be able to see the outlines or shadow the ice casts. Though mostly translucent, a close light source could still cast even a faint shadow if there's enough there to distort light anyways
/me 5wonders if she's just sitting here rambling to a silent wall..
hi Arti
