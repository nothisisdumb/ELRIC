^
13hmm..
13PM me on OFF
OK.
hey Dari whats up
gearing up for another wonderful day of work tommorow lol
and waching SR screw around with his chat bots lol
so what time is it over there?
you get up nice and early huh
well you were the other day lol...think I fed you about 50 quotes lol
I was falling asleep over my keyboard lol...had to bail out
umm
I think around 2:30 or so...I had to be up for work at 6:30
lol
yeah well the Navy has at least given me the ability to go a long time with dismal sleep
you're telling me man
I never want to
but alas....life is life after all
so you on the forum too or just on the chat?
yeah
busy doing your programing stuff anyways I bet
well your smarter then me with em that's for sure
well I know SR does
have talked to him quite a bit over the last week or so
but needless to sa you you both know far far more then I ever will :D
lol...would be fun to learn about it someday
I don't eve know what that means @.@
lol...and IRC is what?
and that does what?
ok
and what is the point of all these channels?
and what's the point of having all these channels?...all of them are just different chat rooms and such?
So you can basically access a bunch of different chat rooms(channels) that are all part of this larger server in general(which I presume is epic-chat Webirc)
and all these are about pokemon or what...or is that just a codename or something
well that's interesting
so is that what you use instead of mibbit for example?..you use this mIRC
is it better then Mibbit?
how so?
which are?
wtf is that lol
and this is usefull how?
so it's like..keeping a history of what everyone says? or something like that
wow lol
so you have everyone's conversations and such?
so you can record even what mods say and everything?
and how did you learn to do this stuff?
so what would the text be if you wanted to record what I was saying?
ah
give me another example
yeah
wow
and that's helpful how
so what you just use it to screw around lol
ohh
wow..where the heck do you guys come up with all these lines of code
?
whats that suppose to be lol
ohhh
yeah I just got that lol
that's strange...so if I wanted to pull that off...I would use that code you gave above?
Hey man I'm just kinda listening right now lol
but someday I might get into it
if it's so pointless then why do you use it Dari lol
I guess so lol
alright then SR what do you recommend then
http://www.bradsbox.info/nub.html
you can make dumb things like that.
who me?
Yeah hes stuck
On another firefox tab probably.
nah I'm here lol
sorry I'm doing paperwork for Coca Cola too
k
well that managed to fuck up my computer at least lol
anyways..what were we talking about?
No idea. Just got here. xD
yeah remind me to not click on that next time
I will if you tell me what it is. :3
umm
I think I'll just get back to filling out orders lol
I just learned that I can send you guys soda if I want to lol...oh woops nevermind...nobody here is in the USA lol
haha
canada eh
well actually I prolly could send you something lol...just a lot more paperwork
awww
How much?
depends on what you want lol
my dad would like some
He like Coka products?
Coke"
Yep
Loves it
drinks 3 bottles of coke every day consistently for as long as I can remember
haha
not nearly as bad as me lol..but still bad
no joke
I'm on my 8th right now
wow
thats crazy
yeah lol
I cant handle all the sugar
believe me it doesn't affect me
lol
I remember the year when we weren't allowed coke or pepsi because my mom thought the terrorists were going to poison it.
not even the powershots do anything for me now
well I never went that far lol...then again I was a big Pepsi drinker before I started working for Coke..naturally
but I just learned today that they are prolly shutting our plant down next year
I prefer pepsi over coke, coke seems too sweet for me.
Pepsi does have more sweetner in it
Oh?
more natural vanilla flavoring
and corn syrup
will you be out of a job?
Hopefully no
If it does i cant taste it.
I think I'm gonna be transfered down to the bigger plant
since I'm one of the few orderers they can actually tolerate
we work right of our houses anyways
ok thats good then
very
I use to be attached to the drivers
w00t my quad xeon server came in today
and they will be the ones out of work if they do shut it down
If you did want something though I would have to fill out an international request chit...enter it into the handheld...call the company to let them know just what I'm doing...sent out the T-Com order to whichever plant in Canada is closest to you..then hopefully within a tolerable amount of time it will get to you lol...and I would be out a couple bucks :D
How much does it cost?
and does the truck come here and unload.
depends on what you want lol...I could send you 5 cases of Coke 20 oz. for $40...and that's 24 bottles to one case so you would be getting 120 bottles at an average price of 33 cents a bottle
but I'm not sure where the truck would drop it..my guess is at the nearest Coke Plant of some kind
I think Dari would be a little harder to pull off though lol
wow
thats pretty cheap
so they wouldnt drop it off at my house then?
I'm not sure bud..I would have to check out just how they do it...when I place a personal order in for myself it drops it off right at the plant...but I think I can adjust it to personal addresses...something I would have to check on
yay me....another addition to my route...
lol cool
yeah It's a good job. Better then most out there
least it gives me reason to stay up late on places like this lol
So how did you fall into programing and everything anyways SR?..just pure interest I'm guessing
Always been interested in computers ever since i can remember
Started learning how to make websites with html when I was 11ish
yeah
I've never seen someone your age know so much about it
So far, I only know one person whos my age and a better programmer.
like I said
don't meet many like that
the only ones I know around here are all 20 plus
But hes asian, and you know the asians with computers...
Internet
dont know anyone like me IRL
Well one thing I can say for Asians...they may make some of the stupidest stuff in the world...but they take great pride in what they do..hence they excell to the max
My aunt is sort of good with computers... she wrote some software and tried to sell it...
but she failed after realizing nobody wants what she was selling.
Shes pretty cocky and outspoken all the time. Its annoying.
well...everyone except me in the family is computer inept
which is annoying since I have to set everything up
Multiply what you do by about 20 and you will see what I have to put up with...
well I'm not trying to outspeak you man. I know that you have a shitload of work to do..I can only imagine what it's like to put up with. I do the same thing just in different fields
huh? I am not trying to argue with you or anything
I know lol
Just saying I get phonecalls daily to do free work i am never paid for
and i cant say no to family
Just saying I can only imagine that amount of shit you do
I can say no to some of them lol
my aunt over in NY wanted me to come set up her new surround sound system and TV and such
Don't think I even ruturned the call
heh
but yeah with all this stuff you do with programs...must be a real boatload
Well, its fine once I get stuff going
and earning
then I can leave it alone and go do other things
Def earning
the annoying part is getting it tested and working
earning, as in getting money.
yeah I know lol
it's definetly making earnings..you just have to work pretty freaking hard
Oh I thought you meant "define" when you said def.
oh no lol
Yeah, I prefer projects I can finish and forget about.
yeah
Dont usually need to touch them again.
I hate leaving things incomplete
I freaking had to deal with the largest paranoid worker in our branch today @.@
he forgets shit all the time...leaves things incomplete
I find it hard to work on the same thing for more than a week
well..when you have so many different things to work on it can be hard to balance your obligations
same thing with me and dealing with multiple accounts
true
but keep a level head and keep moving forward. What matters is how we deal with our obligations.
gotta sort priorities.
yes we do
many times it's hard to maintain that demenor...but dealing with it calmly will sort things right
I have more then enough examples of that
told my dad about that nice discussion we had on the Peter Principle lol
Oh yes?
yup
very impressed with your knowledge about it
Interesting.
about how they talk about me IRL
oh?
lol
well I do the same thing with everyone online except my best friend
he is the only one I will refer to by name
it's a shame that most of the good people I meet seem to be online
It should eventually drive her insane.
you guys talk on the phone?
I need to go buy a new phone
well I know you are looking at that blackberrty
"blackberry"
her phone got munched by the washing machine
yeah
yeah I heard about that lol
I am going to go grab one
once I get my check
don't feel bad that's what happened to my old one as well
or checkS i should say
well I guess when you are use to names like these...kinda hard to fall out of it
those who know my name still refer to me as Red lol
haha
I keep telling them to use my name lol
I like my friends to know me by name
Whenever i talk to someone irl i met online first, I always bug them by calling them by their screenname
haha
it is extremely funny when they use a lot of numbers in their screenname
I bet lol
I have only met one person that I talk to online
actually two technically....but I don't talk about the other one
I met someone online that coincidentally went to my school (before I left school)
well
I flew out to Califronia to meet two
Yeah see, id do a whole lot more flying around if I could.
Just gotta wait until im 18/
well It's not like I can do it every day....but it was enjoyable
my best friend lives out ther
and....my ex..
nice
yeah...another experience that helped make me a much better person
needless to say I'm much more cautious when it comes to long distance relationships
Oh?
Interesting
it's a long story
I only trust it to my friends
OK, no problem.
but I do trust you..so I really don't think it's a problem
I went through a very painful two year long distance relationship with her
met her on an online game...and believe it or not we started talking a lot more then playing the game
I was 18 at the time...she was 15 I believe
think it was 2 1/2 years apart or something
but after a couple months we really fell into each other hard
which is totally against my nature...seeing as how I don't do internet crap like that usually
but we swore that one day we would meet each other
need to be careful since your 18 and shes 15...
very
believe me
but I was just out of High School
and I went right into the Navy
didn't talk to her for two months
which after everything was pretty hard to deal with
hmmm
sorry
disconnected
but I kept my promise to her that I would get out there
and It was this past June...I was 19 and she was 17
needless to say we didn't do anything because I'm not stupid
but it was without a doubt one of the best days of my life
2 years of nothing but talking and we were finally together for an amount of time
its alright
but I only got 5 hours with her
then I had to fly back home
looks like it thought you were flooding the chat
yup
last line i saw
well and we were back to where we started
talking on AIM every night from 10:30 to about 1 or so
timezones?
that was my time
so yeah I was always three hours ahead of her
oh i see
little rough on my sleeping patterns
PST I am behind a lot of people.
but I was extremely commited to her
didn't want to leave most of the time
but I was warned constantly by my father that she was still young...and I def should have listend to him
needless to say at the end of this summer she had indeed changed
didn't tell me much and was very distant
to which I knew something was going on...and finally force her to tell me
she was dating another guy by that point
and it all fell apart by then?
to me...almost everything did
Well, you can't really compete if your not there i guess.
very true
but she lied to me about it
I much rather you tell me to my face then lie to me
and I put a lot of energy and time into her...and all and all I did lover her with all my heart
believe me I'm not like the average guy
I am extremely commited to my relationships...and I put a lot into them
but I slipped into a pretty bad depression
Im so disconnected with people of my generation I don't know exactly what people do anymore when they "date" eachother.
yeah man I'm right there with you
but I couldn't eat or sleep
lost weight
Thats one of the tradeoffs I made when I decided to get into business at my age.
well it's always gonna be tradeoffs
that's how life works now
true
but thankfully my father was there for me when I needed someone
and my friends
I came around after a month or so
tried to get involved with places like spyroforum for example
and writing
just to be around people and develop some social skills again
what did your father think about online relationships?
well my dad is a diehard realist
as I am
when I told him he didn't support it...but knew it was what I wanted to do
over time...things seemed to be working
we made it work for 2 years
I guess I am the same way.
and he knew just how commited I was to her
so he supported us
she supported me going out to see her
"He"
If you knew what was coming, would you have done what you did for the fun of it, or was the end not worth the fun you did have?
believe me man...the good times were the best feelings ever
those are what I try to remember and hold with me
in the end yes....it gave me an immense amount of pain
and I wish I could make it go away
but I did love her with all my heart
and I wouldn't take back the time we had together for anything
it has made me a better person overall
If she ever approached you again, would you talk to her?
I'm much more wiser when it comes to such things
well
as it stands
I have not talked to her in 4 months
and I'll leave her one on her birthday
but I told her before I left
that I would stay commited for one more year
even though she isn't with me
I will leave the door open for one year before shutting it forever
I still remember several of the things she said to me
Thats pretty cool actually.
"I can see myself with you 10 years from now...but for now my heart doesn't need you."
well she is stil young man
she isn't even 18 yet
she has much growing to do
maybe she will come back...maybe she wont
but I'm not leaving this open for long
I have my own life and I have to move on
but I loved her enough to give her one last chance
Thats actually a pretty cool story.
because like I said .....I wouldn't trade it for anything
I am glad you shared it with me.
well
I lke to share my experiences with those who care to listen
especially my friends
I was never in the "dating scene".
well everyone is different man
It just didn't appeal to me.
you dont' have to be
you're 15 years old
you have plenty of time to date
the problem with the world now is...everyone is convinced that if you start younger it's better
but the entire HS drama dating is a load of crap
Ha, Im not saying im worried
no freaking teenager knows what they want
just saying its not somethign im interested in doing just for the heck of it, like a lot of other people do when they are 15.
AGREED.
yes they do
Best statement ever.
but that's not the wise thing to do
who the hell knows what they want at 15 years old
relationship wise
what do you truly know at that age to even consider the thought you can control it
heck I'm 20..and it's still hard for me to control it
I am screenshotting that quote
good because it's true
Because its exactly how I think.
which quote are you talking about
the problem with the world now is...everyone is convinced that if you start younger it's better, but the entire HS drama dating is a load of crap, no freaking teenager knows what they want
stop downloading lol
I blame the media.
you can blame a lot of things man
our society has become so lazy it isn't even funny
most people can't get out of bed in the morning and go do a simple job
they have not aspiration
not reason to build themselves into so mething
not even to develop their minds
all that matters is how they feel and everyone should cater to them
one quote that I do like using
Our country was found on the principle "Life in Persuit of Happiness."
I think if anything, the media and teeny bopper tv shows do get into the minds of children/
(Thats a decent movie)
it is
but the quote finishes with this
Now our country runs on the principle "Life garunteed Hapiness'
hmmm
that's how the average person sees it now
It's a principle that is decaying our society
nobody works hard for it anymore
nobody has any willpower to suceed
"succeed"
or better themselves
We all have to be "buddy buddy"
Have to freaking sugarcoat everything
Agreed.
idk anymore man. Like my sister for example...she considers everyone she meets her "friend"
to me their is a big difference between someone who is your "Friend" and someone who is just an "aquaintance"
to me a friend is someone who if you were to pick up the phone and call them..they would be there for you if you needed it
regardless of what they were doing they would go out of their way to help you
but every single freaking person she meets is her "friend"...and of course being the teenage girl...she is gossip queen central
how many of these friends gladly stab you in the back to look good
hmmm
I may have only a few friends...but I know I can count on them for the rest of my life
they would be there for me if I needed it
how old is your sister?
and I would gladly return the favor
17
and I have one older one who is 21
she freaking makes fun of me because none of my friends are around..and I have only a few
I just reply that every single one of her friends is talking some shit gossip about her right now..at least I don't have to worry about backstabbing
I just know how to pick lifelong friends
hahaha
All my friends changed after I left school.
They are still my friends, but they aren't the same people.
nobody ever stays the same forever
if they do they are a very rare person
but if you find one...keep them close
but yea sorry..didn't mean to rant
that time already
what time you go to school?
I should have gave you another 100 quotes lol..
"When I die I want to go peacefully, like my Grandfather, not screaming like the six passengers in his car."
need to sleep, good night.
night SR
It takes 46 muscles to frown but only 4 to flip 'em the bird.
Son, if you really want something in this life, you have to work for it. Now Quiet! They're about to announce the loterry numbers!
Car service: If it ain't broke, we'll break it.
There is a fine line between fishing and just standing on the shore like an idiot
Your mama is so fat, when she sings, its over
There are worse things in life then death. Have you ever spent an evening with an insurance salesmen?
You knwo the speed of light: so what is the speed of dark?
Wear short sleeves! Support your right to bare arms!
What do Eskimos get from sitting on the ice too long? Polaroids
Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.
Roeses are red, violets are blue, please flush the toilet after you.
but anyways time for me to take off lol
have fun at school!
Night!
no yer not :)

*made
what is?
7I sniped her and then you slashed her up with a machette afterward to make it look like you killed her.
Nope, butterflt knife.
The machete is the official story/governmental propoganda.

*butterfly
6Eek
And I didn't "slash her up" I quietly stabbed the cartoid artery.
Diot?
XD
6._.
*caritod
and what is never over/
6O_O
When?
Whatever it isnever ends.
it can simply be proven by the individual's perception of what an end would be inversed by the true fact of the matter which supplies the knowledge I have.
4She's supposed to be doing it now (the red text monetarily surprised me but then I remembered it be mah evile colour)
e_____e
Thus, it is a never-ending chain of those believing and not believing in a fictional end to any matter via their aforementioned perspective.
6O_______O
So, "Let them eat cake!"
never let your younger sister drive the car
LOL
Lol
What'd she do to it?

Lolz.
4Yes.

4XD JK
Lol
7Meh. There's no way I can stop you (him, the rest of you most likely) and you'll put it back when you're bored with my un-responsiveness. And to be honest, you look better in black
lol C7?

6..
And that you will die with 22 hours.
And remember he had a snake?

I'm Catholic, and I've never heard of someone being "excommunicated" before.

it's from older times.
They don't really use it now.
13Ok
13Sorry
13It's funny..
I don't know if they still do that anymore =P
It sounds like kind of an old practice
It happened a lot during the time Martin Luther was seperating from Catholicism.
If I remember right.
Probably
The Catholic Church was just a little corrupt back then.
@Aic: it's fine, lol.

7I hate you.
6O_O
hm
7Dari: How good are you at L4D?
7Because on the Dead Air campaign everyone was watching the plane crash I was the ONLY ONE who had the presence of mind to shoot zombies off of the broken terminal we were standing on BEFORE they climbed up and attacked us.
7Used most of my ammo, too.
7Indeed. And because I was out of ammo when the tank came and had to use my pistols, they claimed it was my fault we lost.
7Yes.

You can make an internet "browser" in C++ with less than 50 lines of code if you use internet explorer COM object then embed it into a gui but its not really a browser you created, its just embeding internet explorer into a gui.
http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/dan/1-08-09/jamin9306.jpg
No, you embed an IE object into a gui
I can do it in 2 lines of visual basic

power button and end call button, although usually they are the same button.
I put meh monies in an envelope for my new phone.
It's just a quote SR lol
I want to throw my phone against the wall
I should go into rogers and sit on the floor in protest until they bring me a blackberry storm.
The average women would rather have beauty then brains, because the average man can see better then he can think
at the point I will calmly pay for it and leave.
calmly*
haha
I like that one.
lol
Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult
boy... a lot of hate out there tonight

Its a mixture of hate and realism, with a little bit of humor thrown in the mix.
I got too many

sounds like spiteful feminism
I'm not a femenist lol
too many of what
too many stupid quotes
lol
Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain
When there's a will. I want to be in it
EVeryone has a photographic memory; some just odn't have the film
ha
I could've eaten alphabits and crapped out a better essay!!!
If things don't go your way, just keep complaining until someone else does something about it. Thats how I got to where I am today.
Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died
most are plastic lol
I tell my sister quite often I have heard better sounds come out of my ass then Miley Cyrus' mouth.
cause it's true lo
"lol"
In fact I told her that 2 times today
If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?
should we make it 3 to lower her self esteem even more>
If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?
hankypanky
good one.
go pikachu!
Son, employers are like mules. Some you stand in front of and coax them along with a carrot. Some stand behind and kick them in the ass. The key to management is knowing which mules are which.
oi.. so long ago
employees or employers?
Car service: If it ain't broke, we'll break it.
lol
and it's employees lol
my bad
The abundance of microsoft products on your harddrive.
clutter
go firefox
Well, it all starts when your computer attempts to execute code that came from microsoft.
I say "attempts" for a reason.
well it all starts out when your mommy met your daddy
try getting 7 and not the beta
who has IE 5 installed anymore?

ie 7 IS OUT OF BETA.
oops caps
i dont even know what mine is

8gaul
what about him
8cya
oi
what is with people these days
windows update?
Well Dari if you want a good story we will have a new one up tomorrow night
nice little co-write
well it's not going to be very little for long lol
right now it is :D
it's only 3,000 words
But yeah...we really want to blow the top off the Spyro section
besides don't you like long anyways lol
Heart and Soul
really gonna be screwing around with Spy and Cyn in this one haha
what story?
Well John and I have already completed the first story
this one is the sequel
Oh man i just remembered
they idiots still haven't shipped my new aspire one back
0.o
SR did you want to see the story?
Im reading that thread about bullying
the one that Justin Long Fan put up?
I dont remember who
Im remembering something my wrestling coach told me.
Yeah I tried to give him some good advice on that
"No one has the right to hurt you."
His name is Paul, hes probably one of the biggest guys you will meet.
I don't know I have met some pretty big ones
thats why I said "one"
yeaaaah
the military kinda has em everywhere @.@
hes pretty funny
quote
"Your parents don't pay big money so you can come here and lose fights."
haha
I laughed at that one for a while.
lol
sounds like a cool guy
Yeah he tells it like it is.
good
that's what we need in this world
what sort of unarmed stuff do you learn in the military?
as in self defense?
mach takedowns mostly...non lethal close combat
whatever you do.
paralyzing
breaking
I know just about all of em
cool
yeah...only have gotten the chance to test it once...but it works
I don't do anything for "self defense", just do it because its fun.
Oh? Is there a story?
well one guy tried to go after my sister
yeah a little one
So far I seem to like your stories, continue :)
lol
well
I think it's when she was a junior
I was just out of A school
but apparently she got in a pissing match with one of her best friends ex boyfriends
big kid
prolly about 6'4' or so
but he was aggressive as hell
and not to mention mentally unbalanced
I know the type.
but I heard them arguing (I was picking her up)
got out of my car and got between them
and told him that if he touched her I would fucking kill him
not usually my style...but he was getting bad
that and nobody messes with my family
so he went at me
I broke his wrist, twisted his arm...then wrapped my arm around his neck ready to snap it
sounds like fun.
needless to say he is really lucky I didn't kill him
but it's not something I like doing
I do it when I have to defend someone or myself
but I would never a fly...I prefer to help people
never "harm"
i see
just wanted to protect my sister

I managed to stick my hand out so my upper body didnt get wet.
I should have just went swimming anyways for the fun of it.
7Lol
4u tarded now
7I need to get a hold of those pictures.... somehow.
At least I would have got to stay in a nice warm hospital bed after they treat me for hypothermia.
They are not as funny as you might think they are
I just have that "too cold" expression on my face.
7Yes, but a shot of your face would be worth millions (maybe... not...)
worth millions to the first person, but I have a feeling it would decrease in value quite quickly.
4after he mods it
7SR: So I sell it to 5 people at the same time, then there a five 'first' people
back

7SR: You don't count.
6O_O
what I miss?
nothing.
ah
something about donuts and a bi
well..that's certainly interesint lol
"interesting"
good he didnt die
6Wb
Yup good thing.
Sorry I got off, i died and then cme back to life.
*I came
7You can do that?!
7Damn, the plans will have to be altered.
Psssh, all Etherals can.
7I uh mean... You can do that?!
6O_O
/me 4shoots him to see if it is true
*ethereal
we have technology, we can rebuild him
but we dont want to spend alot of money
I'm more machine than man now.
lol at family guy
7family guy is EPIC
Yup.
Yes it is.
/me just notices a bullet in his forehead and pulls it out.
Wow, when did that get there?
yeah it will successfully dull your attention span for a good 30 minutes with funny shit
/me cliched Wolverine rgeneration heals the wound.
*regeneration
7Now then. If you regenerate, what would happen if I totally disintegrated your body?
I couldn't
I'd just die
7Indeed?
Inyuk-chuk
But luckily I'm Ethereal so I'll never be disinegrated.
7Ethereals can't teleport, right?
6Ouch
Well, they are omnipresent.
7That does not answer my question
Consciously, not physically.
Sure ti does.
It means no, but they have something better.
7Good. Then the plans can go forward. Total obliteration of the Ethereals will go forward as planned. The Borg will be here within two weeks, the Replicators and Manytes six hours after.
7Wait, can I rephrase that first part?
7I made a total hash of it
oi
No.
The plan's already in motion.
There's no going back.
7It's called a double-cross, you ignorant fool. The Ethereals will be defeated, no matter what you say.
Well, in that case, I'll ahve to use the elupheus to decimate you first.
It's not resistance when you have the upper hand.
Shit, see what you've done?
You've stuck a song in ym head.
*my
7The upper hand? We are bringing about the full force of the borg, Replicators and Manytes. The full force of the Borg alone could decimate all of the Alpha Quadrant, excluding the annoying influence of Star Fleet.
uh
7Add in the Replicators and Manytes, and the Stargate Program will be over-whelmed by invaders. We have an alliance with Michael and the other wraith too if you must know
7Atlantis will fall.
SG won't allow this.
7SG?
Star gate.
The sentient mind of SG won't allow this.
7Were you not listening fool? Go back and re-read the post
7... The Stargates have no sentient mind. You're thinking of the Tardis
6...
...
They do ever since we added them to the Harvester IV series.
6What time is it where you guys are?

THat's why it took so long
4big comeback
4so scared :P
4nah
4I never even met you
Dari: Because Luke said "I'm doing Dan's mum" and I said "Ok I'll wait 3 or 4 minutes for you to finish" and then HE said "No, I only take one minute, probably less!" and then I lolled lots.
What about the picture
s
4I IN AMERIKA! U IN ENGLND!

4DAT TRU

4I never got an e-mail from you
4if I did, I never looked at it
4or it's in spam
You thought it was your boyfriend that is all
4no, I didn't. Why would you want to send me your stump anyway?
......MUST.....HOLD.....BACK....................................
4I think I kinda set myself up there, but meh
Woops
That wasn't ment to be sent
7This argument is just one big bucket of fail after another.
7Dari: Excuses excuses
4:P
7All the times? Nice one
4shaddup
4at least I noticed it
7Dari: Nice comeback. I scared
7Nice comeback. I scared.
7Go learn what sarcasm is, n00b
That must be satisfying
He's very insulted; you called him a "n00b"
7Dari: I think we have a different definition of n00b. Mine is the correct one, go look it up on wikipedia.
Anyway...anyone else here who isn't arguing
4I here
4barely
4but I here
Hello
7That's it dari, you string a bunch of offensive words together and hope it makes an insult.
Kieran
13RAWR>
Gah
You scared me /sarcasm
13lol
/me 13finished organizing favorites on dA
Plus, you are a n00b if you call others n00bs
13No...
How is being called a n00b an insult? :P
13You're a n00b if you're a n00b and you call a "senior" or respected member a n00b.
BTW guys... http://chat.epic-chat.net/spyrochat is another way to get to this channel from the web.
I didn't call asnyone a n00b I was making a statement
7Your theory states that people who call people n00bs are n00bs themselves, correct?
Correct
7Therefor, you are calling people who call people n00bs n00bs, therefor you are calling yourself a n00b by your own theory. I understand if you're not intelligent enough to understand that, Abbey wasn't.
Lol
erm soz lol
It isn't my own theory Kieran
7I don't care. It's a theory you support
Lol
13lol
13I was testing the link you gave us
7Whenever I tried to explain that to abbey, she did her stupid sexist away messages and then drowned out everything in 'LOL's.
7Nerd.
:P
7Not really mindless, because it's true. Come on here a bit more often before you pass judgement on people, kthx
I've heard about you from other people, and argued with you a couple times already
7I actually have a reputation? Cool.
Not a good one, but a reputation, yes.
7Lol.
7Hey dari, you got GHWT, right? I got mine yesterday. =D
7I need to practise loads on the guitar before I get back up to the level I was. And I hate the drums.
I can't even do Eye of the Tiger on easy on drums which is just red and yellow repeatedly with the occaisional orange and blue.
Yes. I suck lots on drums
Lol
7If you feel like losing, then we could have another argument (forgot mah orange :P)
4here we go...
Now lets have an argument on who won the argument!
-__-
XD
7Bullshit.
7Whatever
Lol
So Dari wins the argument
Nah
Kieran's little paddies keep this place alive
7Dari, the evidence is obvious she /likes/ you, constantly agreeing, and even though she denies it I got her to admit she does.
Oh not this again..
IT WAS AIMED AT YOU KIERAN
7If you say so.
7I don't even remember what you said, I just got you to admit you like dari
You are SO lucky charlie isn't here
4he the father?
Lol no
Charlie insists that I fancy Kieran
4oh
That was my reaction
7I scared now.
but I screamed it
7Dari: Naw, I tricked her into admitting she likes you, and if you simply gather the evidence you see the truth.
Ya
That's it
13.....
I can and WILL get charlie onto xFire
/me 13is pissed.
Sorry
/me 4doesn't care
Doesn't count, it wasn't on the same line

10Nice.
WOw
I havent been outdoors since friday
7IE sucks
10Yes it does.
7oh... Lol.
10I got firefox literally a few minutes ago and I am already finding it quite hilarious :3
4O_o
4I have no issues with IE
10I THINK I MADE MAH POINT :D
Gotta restart
brb
10SHOE
10SHOO*
10PAHAHA Fail.
wtf
why are you nongs using IE
use firefox or google chrome dudes :P
4lazy
Dari, like what
anyway if ur lazy
use firefox
it's way faster
how do you mean it "needs" it
firefox is better
10Whats Steam?
10I cba to go find out. :P
basically, you buy a game thru it and u can play the game on any PC with steam that you log in to
10Ohhhh.
10IE just crashes on me all the time :(
Dari, steam doesn't "need" IE any more than Windows does... the entire operating system is built around the browser, literally
so it's literally impossible to uninstall it
yeah - cos steam uses a browser engine that IE provides :P
Dari, have you run a virus scan
if you haven't, download and install and run the latest AVG or NOD32
AVG annoyed me
It's worth 8 hours to save a complete reinstall isn't it?
Dari, in your dreams.
NOD32 is _the_ best, AVG is a close second.
lol
I'd be asking you that.
If you think AVG is crap, you clearly have too many viruses for it to do a clean install
A lot of viruses try to prevent antivirus progs being installed.
10OH FXCKING CHIHUAHUA CLOUDS!!!
If you install it with a fresh windows, it does the job faster and more efficiently than almost any other.
10... eep
And now you've got this problem
Suffice to say, you fucking moron.
And if you had left AVG you wouldn't have this problem
Wow. Iam Typing By Writing
May I ask how you think it is 'crap'?
LOL
I like this tablet function
lmao
"infections in the registry"
define this plox
what scan thing
one mo
10*dies*
yeah, you ever loaded spyroforums in internet explorer?
(didnt mean to click that button lol)
10Wow.
uh.
well if you had IE 5
i wouldn't be complaining about viruses boy
the best thing you can do to protect against viruses is keep windows up to date
doesn't matter
it was running
it's part of the OS, dude
at this point I would suggest you backup your important files onto a blank disk / drive, scan it with MBAM on another PC
then format ur drive and reinstall windows
because there's almost no chance of getting it working again without a lot of work, soz
exactly.
vai handikapata her death! first learn to play and after, and can plagieze, however great "singer" Vanessa Hudgen pulii copied from a song-zone ... shameful
Dari, there's most likely rootkits and viruses in a lot of your files, like 60-90%
seriously, format and reinstall
gah
trying to translate that bit of text
vai handikapata her death! first learn to play and after, and can plagieze, however great "singer" Vanessa Hudgen pulii copied from a song-zone ... shameful
10......

7I forget, the second series was so damned long ago and I don't think there's a third yet, who's Stephen?
7Stacey: Oh, thank you. Very informative.
10Dari's answer was more constructive, was it?

10And didn't Stephen have an affair with Helen?
10Wow, its all coming back! ^_^
One of my favs is when the girl is trying to push her dad over and she kicks him in the balls and it works
7Dari: Wait... didn't she already clone him? Or was that that guy who got ripped to shreds by a velociraptor and kept coming back?
10...
7"Yes" would've sufficed
7Whatever happened to Rex? He was awesome.
10Especially when he puked on the mean mans back ^_^
4O_o
7I like when they were trying to catch Rex in one of the early season 1 episodes and he got in the elveator and he was dancing to the music.
7Dari: Yeah, but I asked a descriptive question, you only need a simple answer for a descriptive question, as long as it's not an annoying or stupid answer like "He's the one who all the girls like." or "Guy who dies"
7Ok, you go completely ignore what I just said and be a dickweed
7Hey dari (I've probably asked you this already) but what happened to the Zombie Horde 2 hax I wanted you to do?
7Oh yeah. (This is probably a stupid question) but why not use firefox? :P

7I am NEVER playing Left 4 Dead with random people again. EVER.
13I watched my cousin and his friends play that a couple days ago
13I don't even see how you can be serious about it Zombies with bulgy eyes jumping out at you with you using a gun is too hilarious to concentrate.
13lol.
13Well it looks nice.
13I like the art style.
7Dari: If you can host a server or want to go on single player, go to console (hit the `/ key) and type in sv_cheats 1 and hit enter, then type in Z_health_100 for double health zombies.
7Or replace 100 with any number you want. Do the 7x more zombies cheats for epicness.
7For health type in give health, give first_aid_kit (obvious), give rifle (assault rifle), give pistol for dual wielding pistols.
7And all the special infected you need to do seperately, like z_tank_health numberhere (and no underscore between numbers, my bad) etc.
7Wait, no. No underscore between commands and numbers.

You can no logically that peaches can't harm you.

Even if it was a mental condition, that's just basic knowledge.
You can easily get out of it.
However, they're WAY too emotional to realize this.

Nah, don't ACTUALLY HURT HIM, BUT HAVE HIM THINK HE'S REallly hurt when he wakes up.
Like put fake blood all around and small organs.
wOAH, CAPS WAS AN ACCIDENT.
And caps malfunction again. :/
13Dari: Do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWy9AQnCsFE
OK. 1.
Stuff him upside down in a clset, with fake blood onm him and the ground, with small fake organs around.
Hopefully while he's still groggy he'll think he's hurt real bad.
'And it'll be worth it.
7Punch im a couple times too, so there's real pain
13The two dollar store! :P
7him*
6lol
So, when he wakes up, have a knife ready and say: "I'm soprry we had to do this, but you knew it was coming."
*sorry
Oh I see.
7Grab a fake scalple, put his knee in some sort of... thing... and dress some people up like doctors and nurses. "Crap, nurse! The anaesthetic has warn off, get some more. In the mean time, we'll start anyway."
Fake organs, you can get them online or at joke shops if you have any there.
XDDDDD
6oops
7Grab a fake scalple, put his knee in some sort of... thing... and dress some people up like doctors and nurses. "Crap, nurse! The anaesthetic has warn off, get some more. In the mean time, we'll start anyway."

13I am.
13A.
13Bisexual.
13Thank you.
13Very much.
13D=<
That's why he said "You may like this."
4gah, didn't mean it that way
4I meant that it insulted the Jonas brothers
13Well, "gay" is an offense to me.
13-___-
13I'll bbl, schoolwork.
You're gay.
7Because you're a hyper-sensitive 11 year old
6: s
@KJ: Yup.
Because it causes drama.
Which she feeds on.
4http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/8821/I+Hate+My+Neighbor/
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD yes.
6has
that google pic is so fake.
So far she thinks me and my three cousins want her dead and are doing so for 47 grand, and are going to eat her 3 year old brother and slaughter the family because they are witnesses. Also, I claim that she's trying to escape to cambodia.
4I had a feeling it was fake, but stil lfunny
7mispelt*
6as well
7Grammar nazi n00b
6as well
And shes' freaking out and saying she's "too cute and adorable to die"

Yes,.
Also:
NPL: "I was getting some yogurt and my mom opened the freezer on my head"
*into
6to hurt?!
No, not on purpose.
6brrrrrr...
Nothing is better than eternal happiness.
Eating a hamburger is better than nothing.
Therefore, eating a hamburger is better than eternal happiness.
ACtually, she wasn't in the freezer, the freezer door thing hit her in the head.
Thats a Fallacy
6What about potatoes?
So what do you guys think of my invention of the Externet?
It assumes that the person would agree with the fact it "is better than"
I refute that rebutall and instead replace a chunk of reality with my own in which this conversation never happened.
*rebuttal
Lolz.

11TELLING YOU I HAVE TO GO NOW KK BYE
13D'awwh
13:(
13Ok....
13Dammit
13*ded*
aw..
10http://www.funnyjunk.com/funny_pictures/1207/What+The+Heck/ LOL LOL LOL WTF LOLOLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
brb
13...
/me 13kills a hybrid.
13brbz
4...random
...very....
13blah.
Woah, where'd everyone go?
13Hi
Hey
13RDX said he'd brb, Magiky had to go and Batty just left
13lol
That was fast..
What does your sister do? Play games?
Neopets, club penguin, email friends....
We're only supposed to get a half hour each from 3-4:30
13That sucks.
My brother used to have a club penguin account
13I still go on CP when no one's on and I'm REALLY bored, lol
he probably still does have it, auto renewing on my moms credit card she forgot about
I really don't see the point of club penguin
13LOL
It's just like
"R U TAKEN!?!"
13Lolwtf?
That's what my sister complains about all the time
13I go and play the games and stuff on it and collect the items...
13lol...
Random people coming up to her asking her with horrid grammar if she's taken.
I think you can only say pre-defined messages, right?
13there is a lot of that though too
wtf
13on some sections yeah
13you can type
"Taken"?
13and the reason people speak in chat form is because otherwise messages won't show up.
13I have to type in chatspeak on there if I am talking to someone
4Ohh....someone wants an over the web relationship with your sis
Like, if she has a boyfriend
She's 11 T___T
...
13Yeah, it's stupid
Yeah I know, stupid
13I just ignore it normally.
13It's also why I make my penguin crossdress
13Ololololololol
13Everyone else: "EWWWWWW"
I thought you could only say pre-defined things
The club penguin headquarters is like a 3 hour drive from my house.
13NO TANK U
4U SUC
13THERE'S A HEADQUARTERS!? XDDDDD
Hah wow
Neoseeker headquarters is a 1 hour drive
Yeah, where they concoct evil plans.
Yeah, on some servers you can only say predefined things.
My sister has gotten into all sorts of e-drama on there already, apparently
Im near all the internet company peoples.
13The preset word things are better than the one's on Spyro's Lair at least...
Neo is in Richmond I think
Yeah
spyros lair is useless
you can't do anything
and also
they require you to be over 18
...
why dont they let the adults say whatever they like?
13HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT
seriously?
That's stupid
If I remember correctly it says you need to be 18 or older
13Over 18 for a thing for a game that lots of children play?
13HAHAHAHAHA
What 18-year-old would want to waste their time on there?
13Wow
Yep
No one
I was trying to open up the chat system
4wtf
but you can't really do it because of how they have it coded.
It doesnt send a message, it sends a message ID
id 1 = whatever what ever
if it receives "1", it displays that.
Meh I dont need to walk around in some dragon fantasy place and talk to people anyways.
The dragons bounce up and down, hahaha
Thats what spyrochat is for.
:P
Over the summer I was really bored so I just made an account to see what the fuss was about
It looks really stupid
they have some decent artwork though
but they should have made it better and more useable.
7Hell dari!
13:D
7Thank you. It was getting boring poking him
13He doesn't even know what words mean I bet.

13Well, the names you call me are bullshit too.
13Soooo.

7It's fun poking the hyper-sensitive 11 year old and then watching her completely ignore everything you say
lol
don't say that too loudly lol
7Tsch. As I said, I'm not scared of her
7Dari: Hey, I didn't say anything.
oi that figures lol
7Hey, to be fair, I was only reporting the truth. Or possible truth. I'm not quite sure anymore. Hell, I'm not quite sure what I said. (I /am/ pretty sure however, I may have some memory problem)
haha

alright someone tell me whatever who said to who
7CAEK
7I'm reading something
hmm
-.-
7Well, considering there are written versions of pr0n (someone tried to sell me a bunch once. I was disturbed for several days thereafter), but I'm actually reading a comic
7http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/index.php?date=000401&commentary=on This comic, to be exact
7The comic ended three years ago nub.
7Yes, but you said "keeping it busy"
7Read it then. It's a random comedy comic with the worst possible ending. In the world.
7^Fail
12Hello, everyone.
7Dari: It's a fail because it is. It's gotta be the worst response in the world. (Note: 90% of the time your responses are "because it is" so you can't claim that as inadequate without having to completely abandon using the line)
6bye people
12"Because it is" is a form of begging the question, I believe.
12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question
7Yeah, with "because I'm awesome" generally. Besides, you insisting that Bob and George is a pr0n comic is just stupid.
12God, some people need to get their minds out of the gutter...
13Who is AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz.

I'll probably get it back on Tuesday
No school on Monday
I actually finished it in time for once, though
A is easy to get if you do your homework
Hopefully that's a good sign
Not that simple, lol

didn't go so well for me the first time around
I already have to read quite a lot
"The Chinese Government will soon begin a mandatory program which will see all online video game players registering their real information for anti-addiction monitoring purposes."
Not that I always do
XDDD
yeah..
I don't like reading..

Just not school stuff
and school books are not it

I still have another four and a half years of school
I just listen to lecture and i get by enough
well...college is kinda different for me
Id like to do well with school, but I just can't be arsed.
I can't wait to be out of high school
It sucks
so long as you can control yourself on a college campus your fine
Control yourself = No cat... loving.

http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/17/saudi.child.marriage/
ur face luvz tht movee lol
I just wasn't cut out for it I guess
eh wtf are you lookin at
I started my nightly news read.
Pretty much every night I read news for fun.
Yes, I am a loser.
by lookin at thhat address id be thinking something else
I have had enough of the news for now
At least you don't have to read about the Obama family getting a puppy.... =P
too much about how wonderful a certain president elect is
I'm quite sick of hearing about OBama
haha
Internet news is better then TV news.
wow that was wierd...again
I got to hear about how wondeful he was today in front of Baltimore -.-
woopdy doo
Late last month, a Saudi judge refused to annul the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 47-year-old man.
eh..
The judge, Sheikh Habib Abdallah al-Habib, rejected a petition from the girl's mother, whose lawyer said the marriage was arranged by her father to settle a debt with "a close friend." The judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty.
think I pissed off some people lol
Why, what did you do? :P
She said the marriages cause girls to "lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."
ummm
well they were watching it on the tv in the employee lounge
I walked by and stopped for like a minute
and I think I said someting like welcome to la la land
Hahaha
The best thing to do
needless to say I escaped pretty fast
Is to say something
then not argue it.
I speak my mind
I don't care
Haha, good thing you got away quickly
unless I know it's something really bad to say lol
Some of those Obama supporters are pretty nasty
Just keep on saying things and ignoring people when they try to argue them with you.
yeah they are
I tried that with my aunt once
"He is so wonderful bringing all this change."
oi
The phyco one
Haha, what change?
man freakin hate the news for that
he's not even in office yet -__-
I haven;t seen any change yet.
not the change we want that's for sure
their wont be
Change is over rated.
he is already making excuses
"It's worse then I feard"
Didn't he create the "office of the president elect" or something?
What a great idea, give yourself more power
Guys don't eat peanut butter
The latest national food safety investigation took on new urgency Friday as federal officials confirmed salmonella contamination at a Georgia facility that ships peanut products to 85 food companies. On Capitol Hill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested records as it opened its own inquiry.
i think he'll try but i do hope that he does good otherwise we'll be in the shitter
SO you don't have to wait until you're president
yeah yeah
I read something about that
i know that
*So
Yeah, kind of old
yeah
i pulled a bunch of austin snack crackers off the shelf a while ago
and I live in a neigborhood of liberals -.-
"President-elect Barack Obama is preparing to prohibit the use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques by ordering the CIA to follow military rules for questioning prisoners, according to two U.S. officials familiar with drafts of the plans"
think we were the only ones in 10 miles to have a McCain poster
Minnesota is one of the most liberal states in the country
oh yeah I forgot
lol when i heard of waterboarding i though it was a type of surfing
we don't want to be the bad guys anymore
lol
we have to be nice to everyone!!
even terrorists
I was surprised that someone in my neighborhood had put up a huge McCain/Palin sign in their front yard during the election season
^ good for them
We put up conservative signs here.
Yeah, let's sit down with the terrorists and talk with them reasonably
We have 4 parties in canada
main ones.
oh yeah that will work
Stupid... -_-
meanwhile they plot to take out the empire state building next
Haha, yeah
but no....we have to be their friends
Conservatives, Liberals, New Democratic Party, and the Bloc Quebecois
If you hear a ticking noise, it's just them err, crumbling into reason... :P
one big happy family!!
oi too much news
"Hey, would you mind not bombing Israel?" "Oh sure, we hate them, but since you asked, we'll do it for you, Obama!"
Yeah, that's gonna work
you know it -.-
welcome to the liberal mind
let's be friends
Heh
I swear....I wouldn't care if Israel turned Iran into a parking lot
well that's the problem
if we do nothing
that is.
they say we don't care
we got our own problem
when we do something
Apparently it could start World War 3
they call us murderers
If it gets bad enough
It HAS been bad for thousands of years.
the world has been on the verge of WW3 for years
I suppose if [Israel is] severely outnumber against a ton of Arab nations, yes.
*outnumbered
o.o
everyone has their finger on a button
My dad was explaining it to me, but I forgot a few of the details about which countries are allied with which other ones.
this world is really really dangerous
But it's a huge mess
Basically
well
put it like this
IF they stop waring, its a sign of the end times.
once obama pulls out our forces
and nothing is between the Arabs and Israel
hmmmm
Israel doesn't exactly want another Halocaust
and this time they have big bang weapons to back it up
I should think not .__.
lots of them
they attacked us for crying out loud
when we snooped too close
2...
2Okkkk
haha
you think they are afraid to attack the arabs? yeah right
run snowy run
your next
12arabs? Huh
and they will not just attack them they will annahiliate them
12Next, for what?
Who's "they," exactly?
The Israelis will annahilate the Arabs
(I'd really like to understand all of this so I can know what I'm talking about... :P)
palistinians i think
and anyone who will try to kill them
that being everyone around them
Syria...Egypt...Iran
Administrators at an Indiana hospital said one of the three numbers listed for the hospital in the latest AT&T phone book connects callers to a phone sex line.
all of them are still waging the holy Jihad

I only go by what I have seen
brb
and what history has taught me
11ARG
That's why I'm listening to you =P
kk
oh well thank you lol
I'm glad someone is willing to listen :D
No problem :L
I am rocking out to Stewart Copeland at the moment
You guys?
It's kind of interesting
umm
rocking to
TS0!
Alright
I never heard of them :P
Trans-Siberian Orchestra
I don't listen to much music
Ah
pretty sweet stuff
but anyways...yeah I have some pretty realistic views about it
Stewart Copeland is the guy that did the first four Spyro soundtracks
after all...we learn most by looking to the past
I like music, I just can't be bothered to download songs I like to my MP3 player and listen to them over and over
He does some awesome st00f
11o_O
11>=[
and yes Copelands music was awesome
:3
Yeah, I'm going to St. Mary's University =]
St Mary's eh
In a few months
yep
heard of it
4O_o
It's kind of a small school
Really?
my dad had me look at like every school in the country
Its totally smart to talk about where you're going to school
yes I have lol
...
hah, I only applied to two colleges
I applied to four
I looked at four
my younger sister is applying to eight
I got kind of stressed filling out all the applications
so did I
So I narrowed down the potential schools list until I had the few that I was interested in
know your major yet?
They didn't even make me write an essay :L
Not yet
wow no essay?
lucky
I'll figure it out as I go along, I suppose
that's how most do it
I didn't even know mine
What really made the decision for me was the amount of financial aid they offered me
well...kinda
yeaah that will usually do it lol
that's why I went where I did
If all goes well, I might only have to pay $6000 for four years
It's awesome
oh wow
sweet deal
I thought mine was cheap :P
Winona State University just got back to me about my admission
6k for four years?
Holy shit, that's a fucking steal
I'm accepted, but no aid yet =P
But I liked St. Mary's better anyway
that is a really good deal
anyone have anything fun to do?
I have been working all day
need some fun time.
so have I lol
don't feel bad :D
Play Mario Kart with me :P
I would if I could.
Umm
I can share the gospel of Stewart Copeland's music with you?
Aww... =P
I said fun.
Dude, that is fun
Im at home, = dialup.
Just thought I'd ask anyway
Yeah youtube link, dialup.
Cant watch it
You could... help me with this Jawva thing
lol
I am going to miss that excuse
when I get broadband
Fun, eh? :P
I could always use the excuse "dialup" to not watch a youtube video.
XD
But now they are running broadband lines up here
Nice
what compiler do you need to use?
Seriously? :P
I didn't think you'd want to... XD
I don't have the Jawva SDK so i cant compile at home
We can have a socratic discussion on the meaning of life
Doesn't matter
I just need some kind of explanation about what this means
I'll write the code myself
hm
ok
Oh, I know
Your teacher uses terms I don't understand
so yeah
It's the textbook
I know you need to draw a circle
You can hook my site up :P
Hmmm no.
XD
That's fine
Makes everything more complicated than it needs to be
Byethost is a great host
Oh in that case
I wont have to bother atisteo
Alright

Holy... Fuck

Oh
Well, I don't have anything like that on my site
All my images are hosted on Imageshack
Any videos are on YouTube
How much do you have done?
To minimize the Bandwidth usage XD
aka leech of others

Yeah
Well... I'm stupid remember? =P
brb
Leeching is great though XD
Did I show you my site? The skin I made is pretty badass
11so im not banned :D
11yay
Oh my.. I just typed "jawva" into google...
It got you porn, amirite?

11anyone unban HTID?
Got it, thanks
Shit
11hm D:
You need *all that* code to make a circle?
That will help you make a circle
brb
OK, will you cut the swearing please?
o_0
I'll take a look at it and see if it makes any more sense....
Is it because you are actually offended or because SR said so?
11mibbit.chat
Lolzifer
11please unban meh D:
If you google for all your questions, you will probably have better results then asking me
11I must be snowy then
Offended? no. Rather not hear that? Yes.
11ty
11i dont wanna be snowy
Well, you're not actually *hearing* it
Shut up, you know what I mean
XD
No need to try to be a smart ass about everything
I'm a smart ass, therefore I am
hm
Not funny -__-
Understand the mechanics of circular drawing?
I haven't actually looked at it yet
11ummm!
Been talking on here =P
g.setColor( new Color(0,0,0));
g.drawOval(50,75,100,100);
thats basically it
g being a graphics object
whatever the heck that is.
Snowy: Tell someone who cares.
Yeah, that's what I don't get
4Stop spamming
What's a graphics object.... D=
Yes
Err, no
Whoops
Dont you need to create a graphics object or something?
11oh.
Or is the graphics object a handle to the applet gui thingie?
Who's spamming?
I've never done anything with "graphics objects" before
4Snowy. She kept repeating the same thing over and over
Oh
do you know how to draw anything to screen?
Yeah
What you said....
I'm not really sure why, but it's just not connecting right now....
I mean...
Uhhh
Have you created an applet that can draw something
anything
11...
11huh
11...?
Yes, I've done that before
OK, how did you do that?
11Too, much tech talk here..
It was a simple one though
Use bits a pieces
what did it draw?
11o.o Mind boggling.
and did you have a graphics object
of some sort
brb
something.drawobject()
pseudo code

http://workbench.cadenhead.org/book/java-21-days/source/chapter13/DrawCircle.java
?
11hmm :o
11Oh well .
11:3
Woah... that's way more complicated than what I do
Mehh, I'll figure it out eventually I guess
I can't think right now....
:(
seriously though look http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/showtopic18752.htm
I dont do a lot of GUI work
especially not in jawva
It's not really drawing the circle that's the problem though
I could do just that pretty easily
well you should have told me that 20 minutes ago :P
LMFAO
haha sorry
:(
Forget it....
can you draw a circle to the screen?
just a single circle
no fancy stuff
Yeah
Just a circle.
OK
Now
you need to build a class for that
To make it super complicated.
So you forget what your doing.
Gah, I don't even know how to explain what it is I don't get....
Write a class MyCircle that represents a circle to be drawn.
Lets take it step by step.
Just... forget it... thanks for trying though
I'm just gonna go ahead and respond to bmah
I finally understood exactly what you need to do so if I stop now ill fill my head with useless internet things and forget it.
Oops
hit the little red x button
why is it so clickable...
I would ask if that was the toolbar, but you got rid of them all =P

How big is the drive?
250gb
laptop
O_O
What takes up a quarter of a terabyte?
I bought it like 5 months ago
I download a LOT of stuff
Ah...
I getcha ;)
LOTS of random things
and I dont want to delete any of it
so when I fill stuff up I usually go buy a new laptop
there...maybe that will shut bmah's mouth
What is bmah doing now?
Wouldn't it just be more efficient to buy a USB Hard Drive?
Get a good Terabyte one
That'll last you two years :P
Probably arguing in the policical stance thread
Probably
But I don't like to have to plug it in
Oh, fun
oh it was just on the political thread
and take it with me
as times move on i download more and more
it like multiplies.
I promised myself I wouldn't argue about this anymore @.@
Ah
Can't you fit a terabyte into a laptop now, though?
I dont think so.
Its not 2.5inch
Thought you could...
I dont think they make a 2.5inch TB
you reading it lol
Ah
Yep
anyways im happy getting a new laptop every so often
changes things up
They've got half a terabyte SSD for a laptop now
makes everything fresh
I wanted to tell him off myself, but couldn't quite find the right words
However, that costs more than a car
well I did it for you

It doesnt go anywhere
Cornys is a crazy dood

I dont understand what hes talking about
O'Bama? XD

If I can't understand it nobody can lol
Umm, PIZZA!!?
Showing off?
Oh Henry
Henry? :P
Well someone is having a pizza parteh
I cant spell.
Gahhh, I hate java
Things: I want some pizza too.
Screw it, I'll work on it later
Bad spellers, untie!
Im the worst procrastinator ever.
Procrastinators unite... tomorrow!
hm
By your definition of the word, I think I like Jawva
I got a million of these
Java, though, no thanks
:P
well some of it makes sense..
hahaha
I can see the message he is tyring to get out
because yes most of those facts about Bush are true
Bush was an idiot
What kind of pizza?
Plain and simple
/me catches the box'opizza
Every kind >.>
pretty narrow view..but I'm not gonna say anything
Someone who has a C Average in Yale and does coke in the National Guard was out president
Oh, how George Washington is rolling in his grave
I'm a pretty narrow guy
XD
Mile long, inch deep.
yeah especially since the one running our country now has promised everything to everyone that is in no way gonna be delivered
Ohhh, this is not going to end well....
Obviously
Not all political promises are going to come true
The thing with Bush, though
Is only the promises to Rich people came true
and you really think Obama is gonna fulfull his promised to the poor
Well at least im happy :)
yeah right
After he fixes the economy
no
lmao
Which, granted
May not happen in eight years
I know that everything has priorities
*wont happen in 8 years
And some things just can't be done
have you seen the "plans" this man wants to put into action
the ones that cose billions of more tax payers dollars
What
And the bailouts were good and wholesome?
most of which to help those who have no way in bettering themselves?
Things: you there?
Who said they were?
Obama's economic plan is similar to FDR's New Deal
Yeah ?
Make new jobs to fix the economy
Tell marianne that her server is murdering me.
Hahha whats it doing ?
Government and Alternative Energy are going to get more jobs
make new jobs that nobody can take nor have the experience to do
Killing me
Government jobs, like fixing roads and bridges
hey now
yeah live off the government right
Creating street signs
The menial crap
they will give you everything
mooch of all of them
yeah right
Things: It says im using cgi:irc, im using mibbit.
I'm not gonna take any government crap
It both benefits the country
and its murdering me when I connect
the liberals can have la la land
And is a starting point for the economy
and it's not goign to benefit the country
I think her server is racist or something.
It is...?
more and more people
can't hold a simple job
Oh
they can't
Thats weird
they have no willpower
So, you're saying
Cause her own laserchat website usues mibbit :P
they suck off the government
The nation is in economic trouble because we're lazy?
LMFAO
this country has been getting more lazy for the last 40 plus years
No, of course not, it's obviously because Bush is an idiot
ever since social securtiy
they watned to create a "perfect society"
Dude
Err, sarcasm =/
for what reason
when they came with the idea of giving everything to everyone
because they lived here
now everyone expects something
There's no way you can blame the economic mess entirely on Bush
You know what was fun... when the canadian government gave everyone $100 :)
and the liberals love to deliver on it
but guess who pays for it
those people who actually do go to work in the morning
Sounds awesome
Wasn't the cause of the failed economy loans that lazy people couldn't pay back...?
Things: REALLY?
Sort of
Yup
I'm not putting faith in any plan that is going to have me paying off thousands of my own dollars for nothing
What happened was the housing bubble exploded
Thats why your economy sucks, your government had to print all that money.
Well, the money went to the parents, but they got $1000 for each kid
banks gave out loans to people with no colaterol
Hahaha
Yeah, that's what I mean
As banks were giving money to people who couldn't never pay it back for houses
They got lazy
So, what
So we got $3000 >.>
people are more lazy now then ever...and it's getting worse
And gave out the loans to people who couldn't afford them
You'll put your faith into bailouts instead?
they still should of had colaterol
dude now that is tupid
Stimulus\.
Better that than government programs that "redistribute the wealth" so it can be fair for everyone
Thats communist.
But they don't...
Seriously...if "George Washington" ever saw what our society has become he would be crying
We don't do that
That's funny, because I definitely thought I heard Obama say stuff like that
Am I right?
There is social security for those who cannot work
Or I'm just making stuff up?
And there is unemployment for a small window
at least they had a sense of purpose
small?
I think its like 30 weeks
most people don't do shit in this country
I haven't been unemployed though
I think you're generalizing
The reason a lot of people don't have jobs is because of layoffs
Because people can't buy things
no I just don't hide behind the "pitty' wall
Because people don't have jobs
if you want to make something of yourself then do it
What wall?
people have no drive nor will to become better
I do?
And a lot of other people do
most poeple can't hold the average job
Because of this no child left behind crap
they are so stupid with common sense
And again, you're generalizing
this just isn't schoo things
Can one of you guys change your text color?
I see ite every day
So Its easier to see whos saying what
4Better?
Yes
4Yeah, but you're living in the ghetto
lol
Switch it around
I don't live in the ghetto
Raidon, you be blue
I see many places
4I'm a libertarian actually

4Red is my color D:
2I'm liberal though, SR :P
4 0.o
4wow I'm not use to this

8Libertarians are yellow?
8Is this visible?
4hardely
No, change it nao plz
2No, I don't think so
2XD
2Anyways
It's hurting my eyes
2Your view is wrong
Ohhhh
Libertarians hurt my eyes.
4and yours is right?
There's a good comeback
2All you're seeing is a select view of people
2That came out wrong
4oh give me a break
2...
4I swee it eveywhere I go
4you're going to tell me
2This is like comparing microeconomics to macroeconomics
2You're only looking at a tiny part of the country
4that their are more "intelligent hard working people' in this country
2You need to look at the big picture
4what big picture? Dude look at nation surveys
2I'm not going to say they're evenly distributed
2Because people are dumb shits
Its above mexico and below canada, I believe
2And ask people that actually give a crap
2Right
4so we have a neverending cycle of idiots beeing bred
4yeah pretty much. This country has been going downhill for years as I said
2Wow, that's kind of, hopelessly vapid
4we are getting more lazy every yea
4"year'
But it's also true
2I don't think so
4well I see the truth
4I don't sugarcoat things
2Okay
4I don't see false promises
4no thanks
2So you're seeing people who can't hold a job
4I see where things are going
4dude I work for a living
2Have you looked elsewhere
2Like, where there are jobs?
4idk...lets look...even the simple things
4hs people who work at freaking mcdonalds
4wal mart
4kfc
4and of course they get fired
2And, what, they suck?
4because they can't even do that
2Yeah, because they decide to take baths in the dish cleaner at KFC
4they don't go to school...nor make any attempt to better themselves
2That's because of bad parenting
2That kids think
4the bad parenting that is being spread
My friend tylor got fired from Tim Hortans (I dont think you got that in the usa) for stealing doughnuts. Hes a big fat kid so it was funny.
2:Oh, I'll go be a gangbanger, I don't need a degree for that."
4hence why we have more and more idiots
2No, see
4nobody cares anymore..it's all about ME
2The problem is that we don't have a good education system
4give me what I want
2Because, again, of no child left behind
2And, hey, you know what, people are selfish
2That's one of the principles of Economics
4eductation has been going downhill before Bush even came into office
2No shit
2No Child Left Behind
4selfish the point where they just dont' care about anything
4hence they don't better themselves
4hence the liberals give them everything
4which they take away form workers
2That's... the opposite of Selfish
4who actually do something!
2And no, the liberals don't give them everything they want
4yeah right..they promise them everything and you know it
If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more?
4pretty much
4I work hard every day
2There is social security for those who *Cannot* work and those who can't get a good job, but are trying
4and I"m gonna get charged more!
Because it makes it fair for everyone! Yay!
2I don't mind paying taxes
4yeah one big giant pitty fest
4that's just what we need
2What
4feel sorry for everyone
2And the bailouts aren't a pity fest for those on Wall Street?
4we have to give everyone equal rights
4but don't worry...if you say something you will get sued!
2Social Darwinism?
If I work hard and make money, why should I be taxed more? Because I can "afford" to be?
4liberals and lawyers
4great combination
2Yeah, SR, pretty much
That's stupid
Thats dumb
2Hey, go to Iran then
People could just sit there and do absolutely nothing
No ill stay in Canada
2Its like association fees for living in a Condo
Out of the USA
4the harder working people get more screwed over every yea
4"year"
and Iran
And the people who work hard to earn their money will have to help them
2Dude
4to take care of those who need it more
4supposedly
4this war isn't pointless thank you
4join the military like me
4then you will see just where our resolve it
it is not pointless
4"is'
If you are disabled or mentally ill, you should receive support. If you are fully capable of working but do not work, then its your own fault. And don't give some BS about not having jobs, there ARE jobs. If you can't finf them, then you are lazy at that too.
4I protect those I love man
2So we were in there under false pretenses
4I'm not gonna sit here and watch something else burn
4no thanks
2Dude
4the towers were more then enough
exact;y
*exactly
4I have been with those men
4they know what they fight for
4and that's to keep those terrorists away from us
If we leave, we will be attacked again
4I sure as hell don't want them here
4thank you for pointing that out Dari
2...
Is it really just the people who are /not/ actually fighting physically for our country that are complaining about the war?
2Iraq or Afghanistan?
4I know things and reasons why we went into Iraq
4I'm not allowed to share them
2XD
2Seriously
4are you in the military?
4join it sometime
2No
2RDX
Heh, I've noticed
2We went to Iraq for WMDs
2They had none
4maybe you can learn something
2They had no ties to Al-Quadea
Just didn't have anything to say back =P
4oh you don't know the half of it
2They were never going to attack us
4believe me
2 2% of those we're fighting are Al-Quaeda
4lol
2The other 98% are people who want us to gtfo
4It's too bad I can't share some of the stuff I know about it
2WTF are you, CIA?
4nope
Not that good at multitasking sorry =P
of course you can
4lol
:P
4no I can't
2Gee, you think you have a big dick today
2There is no reason to be in Iraq
Hey, and you don't?
4believe me MP's have their advantages
hahahaha
You're just as bad, if not worse
2If we're at war, the public should know the reason, amirite
4really..why don't you go over their and find out for yourself
4I'm sure they would love to meet you
2We were told bullshit reasons
4and you do know that 90% of the media are liberals
2What? The 2% Al-Quaeda or the 98% enraged occupants
4oh yeah I forgot about that
4they pretty much twist everyrhint
4"everything"
Fox is the other 10%
2And Fox News doesn't?
4yeah they are lol
4yeah all 10% of them!
Oh boo hoo hoo, let's all complain because there's one news channel that's biased the other way
2CNN
4lol
2Larry King
2Watch it some time
The media is corrupt any way you look at it.
/Something/ has to at least balance it out
4I do thanks
2Pretty unbiased, IMO
4now go watch just about every daytime television broadcast
The media is corrupt any way you look at it.
Yep
2See, I don't
One show I can;t stand is The View
Why do people watch that?
4oh wow
4shocker
2I get my news from CNN.com, which is pretty unbiased
4and yes I agree just about all media is in some way corrupt
I get my news from the internet, like a normal human being. [/comic book guy]
2However, that isn't the point
4that wasn't directed towards your "point"
2That's completely divergent to the fact that those we're fighting in Iraq aren't Al-Quaeda
2brb - Foodz
Wow
Who are they?
4innocents don't ya know!
Attacks on the usa?
4I'm getting sick of red lol
You need to stay red
it signifies anger.
4lol
anger against... people.
4I'm not angry though lol
4lol
I guess
Umm
pretend you are.
4lol
4we have our reasons for going into Iraq believe me
4I wish I could state some of them
98% of statistics are made up anyways
:P
They will take him away if they find out.
4When you have been through what I have you would know
away... forever.
2Back
4I am sworn to top secret levels
4and yeah they prolly would lol
4knowing my luck
2I'm going to call bullshit on that
4Well, wouldn't taht suck
To the land of... people who can't keep their mouths shit.
shut*
2If you were privvy to classified information
4calling bullshit on what?
2You wouldn't be flaunting it on the Internet
:P
4lol
Your cool when you have secret info.
4again it's something you don't understand
2Yeah
2Lawl
2Try me
4you never will
4unless you join the military
2...
2I know people in the military
2And I have never heard this before
4and see some of the shit i have
2Oh, boo hoo
ask them for secret docs.
2You saw people die
2You saw kids play soccer with skulls
2No reason to waste billions of dollars in a pointless war
OK, why would he be making it up? Why would he be fighting in the military if there was no reason?
4actually I have not seen someone die thanks
There must be one
2Okay, fine
2Are you deployed atm?
It's just not logical that there isn't
4I have not been into the killzone yet
2Okay
4and no I'm not
2So they tell you this stuff
Or there would be no one out there
4my only deployment has been to Europe
2But you've never been to Iraq?
2Bull. Shit.
4Dude I'm part of the Military Police
2Classified information is on a need-to-know basis
No, know-to-need basis.
2If you were serving in Europe, they would't tell you
In soviet russia.
4this isn't that kind of information that you are refering to. We had our own reaons for going into Iraq
2XD
2For Daddy Bush's good image?
Good image?
what good image?
4you go serve yourself you bastard and you find out
2Okay, so I sign up for the Military
2Then they let me in on the great secret of why we're actually in Iraq
I think the last thing Bush cares about is his image...
If he cared about good image, I don't think he would have gone into the war in the first place since everyone hates him for it so much
2And yet, of the millions of people in the Military
Exactly
2No one has posted it on the Internet
4I'm not part of a normal division genius
2Orly?
4lol you really have no idea what they are capable of do you
T___T
2Try me. I said try me.
2XD
4lol
4no no I"m sad to say not
4is pretty popular in India though
Special division of the military, officer of tasty beverages.
4lol
4would be a sweet job not gonna lie
Literally sweet.
4I joined the military for my own reasons. But to see this country attacked...and see innocent poeple suffer for the radical beliefs of others is more then enough to put aside my own security to do what is right
2I got a novel idea
2Let's beef up domestic security then
2As opposed to going to war with whoever looks at us funny
4lol
4well at least another attack such as that has not taken place again
2For how long?
2If we keep deploying our military all around the world
2No one will defend us at home
4well Bush wont be in office will he. Obama wants to bring the soldiers home. Where they were to begin with when the attack happend
2What?
4I don't want to see more innocents fall from the towers
2That was so gramatically disjointed, I couldn't understand that
4that was just horrifying
4you say that nobody will be here at home to defend us
4our forces were not even deployed when 9/11 occured
2That's because of incompetance
4is it now
2Bush got a briefing on his desk
2A month before it happend
Are you saying they should have been deployed?
4so if it happens now it's because our military is away
2"Bin laden determined to strike"
2And it even labeled the WTC as a potential target
2And Bush ignored it
4and needless to say ever since then nothing has happend to this country
4and nothing will happen thanks that hard earned lesson.
2The man really fucked up
4and yes the deaths are nothing to celebrate
4we have had many good men killed
brb
4but they joined and were willing to do what they knew was right for them
2More people died in Iraq than WTC
4I'm not going to sit back and watch it happen again
2And, I would like to add, they died in Iraq pointlessly
2Yes
2But invading Iraq does not stop attacks
4I know that...we also have more people die every year in car accidents!
2If anything, it promotes them
4is that pointless as well?
2That's beside the point
4is it now
2Yes
4more poeple die because they are drunk over here
2Because Iraq was preventable
2Many times, car accidents aren't
4yet guys laying down their lives for defending us is so horrible and worng
2Go back to my main point
2Invading Iraq does not stop attacks
2It only promotes them
4really?
4I have not seen them yet..where are they?
4if they do happen
2You noticed how more people wanted to blow themselves up when we invaded Iraq?
4it's not gonna be under Bush's watch
4yeah over there
4not here
4where their are innocents
2Because they can't get over here
4the middle east was willing to blow itself up to begin with
4you can't stop what is happening out there
2The Middle East has no Navy, no Air Force
4it has been going on for tthousands of years
2Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's still killing citizens
4they have no desire to have anything
4except their religius beliefs
2...
2Now you're stereotyping
2Only Islamic Extremists blow themselves up
4Why cause I'm saying the truth?
4extremists want something horrible
2Now, people are pushed into Extremism whe we do this shit
4and that's what the ME has come to
4religious wars
4like always
2...
2There were less extremists before we invaded Iraq
4it's been going on since the freaking crusades
How do you know that?
2Yeah, difference is though
4because he just knows
4don't ya know
2They were some crazy nutter faction before we justified their actions
How can you even prove that?
2People feel they have to take matters into their own hands
2Look it up on the Internet
4We are considered evil when we do somehting
2Al-Quaede recruitment shot up when we Invaded
4then not caring when we don't do anything
No one goes around to people's doors and asks, "Oh, hi, are you an extremist?"
4either way they will view us as the bad guy
2Yes, but less will
Proof?
4I'm not going to watch Osama Bin ladin on freakign tapes wanting to kill our people
4not thanks
=P
2Huh?
4he tried it before and failed
But really
4tried it again and was successful
2I saw it on TV, so I don't have a link
4and watns to do it more
4Hell no!
2Okay
Obviously it would though, because they need more people
4I"m not gonna sit and watch that happen
2I have a novel idea
2Instead of invading a pointless country, let's focus on capturing Osama
But if they joined, they obviously had the beliefs in the first place
2People can be swayed to beliefs
What's important is that the attacks aren't happening
Not likely something that big.... Blowing yourself up is a lot to ask of people
2They're running a whole propaganda game in the Middle East
2For recruitment
4The extremists were always there. They were there before the invasion...and the attacks would have continued
4what's important is that we keep them over there
4not here
2Yes
2But there weren't people in Iraq that wanted to blow themselves up to get us out until AFTER we went into Iraq
4I'm not gonna let 200 innocent people burn to death because an extremist wants to go out in the name of allah
2Which is 98% of what we're fighting there
2So, let's kill him
2Let's just kill all the Muslims
2Even though only a few of them hold the Extremists beliefs
4how do you know
4you knwo just what every Muslim is thinking?
Wtf
Bombing abortion clinics?
2We can't
2Which is why we can't justify a Crusade
4the crusades and holy wars are part of life for arabs. It's how they have been born and raised. YOu really think that's gonna change?
4no matter what the middle east is screwed over
No one does that though....
Or not that I've heard of...
2Google it
4once they piss of Israel enough they will do even worse then what we have done
2Again, you're stereotyping, RDX
4am I now
2Not everyone holds the Jihad view
4I'm not arguing with history
4no only most of them. I'm not gonna sit here and pretend to be everone's friend
4who started it is not the issue. They continue it
2That's /still/ stereotyping
Kind of is stereotyping though. I know some Muslims and they're definitely not extremists.
4go watch the movie kindgom of heaven sometime
Pretty nice people actually
4oh big bad stereotyping
2So, what, when we attack, they're just supposed to lay down their arms and stop fighting
4I've seen enough to know my faith in the matter
2...
2Oi
2But in Iraq
4in the end it wont come to us. Israel will do it sooner or later
2They're defend their HOMELAND
2Not being tools of their religion
2Big difference
2Let's suppose that China took control of the US
4you don't know what the Iraqui High command was thinking
2Would you be a part of the revolution to get them out?
2Its essentially the same thing in Iraq
2People are trying to get the US out of Iraq by any means necessary
2People do crazy things when cornered
2Okay
2By this Iraqi High Command and Saddam thing
2What do you mean by that?
4Do you know what they were thinking. Do you know their plans. Do you know just what they were hiding. Because I garuntee you that you don't.
2No
2We don't know what China is thinking
2Let's attack them
I don't think he's saying he does
2I don't know what you're thinking
China didn't attack us =/
2Iraq didn't either
There's kind of a difference
2Al-Quaeda attacked us
2Whom were based in Afghanistan
2Iraq had no connection
Yeah, and that's who we're fighting, isn't it?
4and your living in la la land so I think we are just about even. We have gone for the source and we went for other sources that posed a threat to the United States
2But Iraq didn't pose a threat
2They had no WMDs
2They weren't making any either
4you don't know that
2If we were going to attack a country with WMDs
2Why not North Korea or Iran?
2I do know that, because UN inspectors found NOTHING
4and I again say that you don't know the half of it
2Then tell me the other half of it
2You can't debate on "I know something you don't"
2Especially when you're talking out of your ass
4and I can't for obvious reasons. But the UN said what they had to say through control of the government
2ROTFLMAO
2Seriously, ROTFLMAO
4you can accuse me of whatever you want to
2You are saying
2No one government can put the UN up to do anything
2Then who?
4their are more then just the United States at work here. Far more
2One sec
2Let me retrieve something
4all I go is from my own personal beliefs and what I have been told
4and unless they have been lying to me
4then I put my faith in what they say
4then I still hold firm to my own beliefs
4just like everyone does
2Okay
4this is why I don't like arguing about this
2So the other forces in work are... Romania?
2You've been lied to then
2Because your argument is 100% bullshit
4what the hell are you talking about
4there is
2Romania is, from what it appears to be, the country with the second most deployed forces in Iraq
2Since the UK is bailing
4this isn't just about forces. I have been told stuff about the invasion that is reason enough for me to believe that we went in there for the right reasons
2Then tell me
4and wether or not they are lying to us still doens't affect me..I hold firm to what I believe is right
2You cannot have a debate with no evidence
2All you're saying is "I'm right because I know something you can never comprehend."
4when are you going to understand that I can't freaking tell you anything about it. I have said it ten thousand times
4I am just defending my own views on it
2That's why religious debates are bullshit, because religious folks fall back on the "Well, look in the Bible."
2So
2You are privy to a grand secret
4I learn from history
2To why we invaded Iraq
2That many other people know
4and history is doomed to repeat itslef
2That has not appeared on the Internet?
4over and over again. It's not going to stop'
2Not for six years?
2No leaks?
2Abu-Ghraib gets leaked, but not the real reason we invaded Iraq
2Bull. Shit.
2Stop talking out of your ass and learn to debate.
4and you assume to know everything..that doesn't mean it's true because of your own beliefs
4what did you say Dari?
2I've backed up all my statements
2You rely on "I can't tell you"
4we went after the source of the problem. And that problem stemmed from several different locations. Violence does nobody good yes...but it has been occuring for thousands of years through our own will or not. It's going to happen. But I'm not going to watch our own innocent people die when we could at least make it saffer for our own
4and it's not my fault that I'm in a position where I can't share information. That's just where I have brought myself today
2We can make it safer by attacking random people?
4I joined and I'm here
2Making enemies is not going to make us safer
2Tell me
4the enemy is over there
4not here
2Are you deployed in Europe right now?
4actually I'm on leave. I'm in the states until I get my next assignment
4hence why when Obama draws out it gets more dangerous for us
2You really think that the Iraqis are going to swim over the Atlantic Ocean
2*Pacific
=/
2To attack us
2After we leave their country?
4we went for the root of the problem and their were Al Quida contacts in Iraq that had to be dealt with. We defended ourselves when neccessary to do so. At least Bush had the freaking drive to actually go do something. Democrats will try to "talk it out'
2Al-Quadea had nothing to do with Iraq
4Al-Quida still exists and they operate everywhere within these locations. Drawing out will not help that
2Osama PITIED Saddam
2Because Saddam let the Jews into his country
2Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11
2So we go and attack them, real smart
2Again, why not Iran?
4Al Quida had contacts that we went for in Iraq
2There are more people from Al-Quada in Pakistan
4they were there. And Suddam wasn't exatly Mr. Nice guy either
2Why not attack them?
2So we should take down every dictator then?
2If we're pegging dictators, let's go to war with Cuba
4when they pose a threat it is neccessary to do so. That's where we felt the root of this problem stemmed and we went for it. Suddam was practically insane. Leaving him around for even longer would have done nobody any favours
2I would argue that Ahmadinajad is even more insane
4then that's your argument
2I would argue that the Ayatollah is more insane
4I can't talk for my superiors
2I would also argue that both have WMDs in Iran
2Which far outweighs Saddam's imaginary WMDs
4Once we pull out things will only get worse
4and it's going to start with Israel
2Israel has the strongest army in the world
2They'll be fine on their own
4thats the point
4when the Arabs go for them
4which they wil in a matter of time
4Israel isn't going to let another freaking halocaust happen
2Yeah
4pretty close Dari
OK
so im back
4they even attacked us
2They have a lot of technology and training
4when we freaking snooped
OK Listen to me for a second
pay attention to me.
2kk
I want your focus.
4k
I need to vent for a minute
2A'ight
12Huh?
OK, so today
I usually don't get mad at people.
Especially my parents, because they usually don't piss me off.
But today, they really ticked me off
First
My mom decides she will search the internet for "young entrepreneurs" to try and find "kids like me"
2XD
4lol
So, she finds this kid's site who makes about 5x the amount I do
2My mom did the same
4 0.o
and she says "hey, look at this! This kid is just like you!"
So
She prints out his blong
blog*
and some articles about him.
And shes reading them to me while im on IRC
=/
Now, that really pissed me off
4hm
for one, shes payed more attention to some random kid then she has never paid attention to me
2Is she trying to find you friends?
As if you couldn't find people "like you" if you wanted to.
4yeah
and two, shes reading what hes saying and trying to "give me advice"
2Lolzifer
That really pissed me off.
2Tell her to fuck off
2:D
4lmao
4I'm in the mood to second that
"lets go print off some stuff about some random kid, which is more then what I have ever taken an interest in what my son does."
OK, can we go back to the debate now :P
Its like a slap in the face without the physical pain.
2Start cutting yourself, they'll pay more attention to you then
No way, im still badmouthing my mom.
I want to watch it for my last two minutes =P
4lol
4oh yeah only an hour for you
4I forgot
fine, return to your debat
Mhhm
4or however long
debate
4I forget
Im finished.
Internet goes down at 10
9L59
4oi
2:/
1 minute
4that sucks
2Right
*9:59
2Where were we?
ping timeout
4idk
4where were we anyone know
2Israel ending the world
4ah yeah
4how advance they are
2Personally, I don't think we need to get involved in other's affairs
2If Israel wants to fight ,fine
4we don't
4just proves their resolve
4they don't want others screwing with them
2So>
2*?
2As long as we're not getting shot at, I call that a win
4so they are not afraid to kill anyone who wants to kiill them as well
2I'm not seeing how this is a problem
4well the only thing now is that they have some not so nice weapons as well
4and if they are threated enough tehy will use them
2And yet, we haven't been attacked yet
2In this scenario
4no but that would involve the whole world would it not/
2No
2Israel vs Middle East
2Don't see how we would get involved if we remained neutral
4We are Israel's allies
4and that's not changing as far as I can see
2We were allies with Britain during the 2nd World War
4if we sit back and do nothing..again they will say we don't care...if we do then we are accused
2We didn't join WW2 until Japan attacked us
4this isn't ww2
2I'm saying
4I see what you are saying
4I don't see that happening
4if one nuke gets launched the world will go nuts
2Which is why its great to not get involved
4everyone has their finger on a button
2Then no one will nuke us
4in today's world it's only a matter of time before everyone gets involved
4if one launches how long will it bee till the next one does?
2Then you try your damndest to not get involved
4that's a risk that is every evident
Bah
2Anyways, SR, you were venting?
Im finished
2Oh
4you sure lol
4nothing else?
2>_>
2Anyways
2So, what, attacking Iraq wasn't risking?
actually I was tlaking to her on gmail chat
2*risky
but her internet died like 3 seconds in the middle of an important convo
4I"m not refering to Iraq right now
2I'm comparing things here
2How do we know that the terrorists don't have a nuke?
Because no one can prove I sold it to them.
2Do you know how many nukes disappeared when the Soviet Union collapsed? Its entirely likely
4why would someone be stupid enough to launch one at us. If we really wanted to we could wipe them out in the blink of an eye. But what the hell will that do for the world
4either way we would be screwed
4everyone has access to them now
2I thought you said that all the Muslims wanted to die
2In Jihad
2By your logic, its a win-win for the terrorists to nuke us
4Muslims hold that belief firmly in their palm. My personal opinion states that they are not afraid to die for their god or for their beliefs. That's just how I view it.
2Okay
2Then they should nuke us
2Because then we'd nuke them
2They'd die for god and kill us
4well if they want to go for it. But this revolves mostly around the holy land that they once had. Again that's just history for you
2That's by your logic
4not all of the are extremists yes
4as you said
2As I recall, the Jews had Israel first
2Oh, NOW you agree with me
4but the ones that are will go after that no matter what
4The jews were given Israel
4that doesn't meant that the ARabs wont go after it
4they have plenty of times already
2Erm, no
2The Jews claimed Israel
4eerrrm yes
2And had it until Rome took it
2Erm, no
2The Bible is not a history book, sorry
Lets get our land back by blowing it up.
4It is their homeland. They are in control of it and they are not going to let Arabs, nor Syrians
2Thanks for playing though :P
4nor anyone aroudnt hem get into it
4and they have the capability of ending it if they want to that's all I'm saying
The Jews run the world.
4but if one nuke goes off I see nothing but more in the future...that's just how I picture it
2And, if we stay far away from it, then we'll be fine
4jews are smart
4 0.o
They run the world.
4you can't stay far away from it today. That's impossible
2Far enough away to not get nuked, entirely possible
4no it's not
2Ghana doesn't look like its going to get nuked, IMO
2Barack Obama isn't Jewish
4^that would be intresting
The jews run the world
They own the Federal Reserve
2They have the capability to do so
4yes it would be
4but I just see it happening
4you can't avoid it
2Since we could literally destroy a country with our arsenal
2Yes, you can
4well needless to say that whenever whatever happens
ALLAH
4I hope I'm dead
2Well, you're going to Iraq
4I might be
2Shouldn't be long
4not certain yet
2Hope you have your can of silly-string with you so you don't get hit by ICBMs
I don't think its something you would want to laugh at.
4hopefully not
2I'll watch the Daily Show when it happens
2I'm sure Jon Stewart can make a nuclear holocaust funny
4Good old John Stewart
4I like Colbert more
2You can't beat Stewart :/
2Colbert is really good though
4lol

7 13*666 = 8658 = the number of ultimate evil?
10My sister says my lucky is 742617000027.
10........ Hm... you have a point.
10paraskavedekatriaphobia = Friday 13th phobia o.O
647 = more evil than 8658
10O RLY
YARLY
7 8658 squared = 74960964 = even more evil?
10 1115040540.5810810810810810810811 = superly evil number. Nuff said.

Hey/
Hey.*
13hi
Hiii
each one getting abused by alcohol :P
Mainly Vodka and scotch at the moment but oh well
How does alcahol abuse you...?
Aleono can do those things
Ever made an alcohol bomb before?
Aleono is alcohol...?
No
Then it's not alcahol abusing them. :P
Aleono can control alcohol :P
...
What?
How do you 'control' alcohol?
Omg, you don't know?!
Pouring it into a glass
...
Duh?
......
That isn't controling it.
It is in someways
And if you drink pure alcohol, well enough of it, you will die.
I have to say, the first two comics are of Gilden and Aleono
What do they do, get drunk then wake up the next morning in the same bed?
Lol no, but that's a good idea
First page is the classic Pudding Fire with a Bukkit of Vodka
Then a scotch bomb on the next
Ali does :P
I'll load them up
7Dari, let the baby have her bottle

7Hey Dari, you're a computer nerd, how accurate is IP tracking?
With UK IP's, mine can be accurate even to town.
Sometimes more accurate.
To find out pretty acurrately his area.
!isaway lololol
7Dari: Ok, stupid n00b threatens to track my IP adress for no apparent reason, how condescending should I be is a better question.
Well IP tracks are mostly complete crap.
Just own him.
Well she didn't deny it.
7Indeed
I don't need your shit today
GeoIP is only accurate to the country, sometimes state if your lucky. Don't hold you breath about anything closer.
Oh hello sir
7No-one ever /needs/ our shit, you get it anyway.
Kieran just please stop it
7SR: Thanks, I've been meaning to ask this for a few days. You're just never at your keyboard :P.

Lol, WTH?
I'm watching that.
What's it from?
2Loch Ness Terror
LOL
2It was one of those movies on Sci-fi
Aww, you got it off at the end of the first one, just when he was about to get eaten.
You cut it off on the second one as well...
2:)
2Intentional
2Someone uploaded the whole movie.
2Don't know if its still up.
Lawl.
Why the hell does she just lie down on the ground so it can eat her? O_o
2It senses movement
2Any movement attracts its attention
Oh right.
13roar.
Still, when it's eating one of them, the others could run, yet they just stand there.
2It's all the heroic stuff.
LOL it's standing over him, then he goes out of the car to get the keys.
What an idiot.
Lawl, you just see him get dragged off in the end.
Is that the end of the film?
Or do they kill it?
2They kill it.
How.
2Why can't they have movies where the people actually die....
I know.
2They burn a hole in it and stab a poison thingy into it.
Kind of crap.
Oh.
There's some film called basilisk or something.
Where some huge serpent goes round eating people.
They kill it as well, eventually.
:/
2I've seen that.
Heheh.
2If those movies were real, just stay near the main character.

It's been a while since I've seen you, Abbey O_o
14Yup stupid moving >=(
4 0.o
7Dari: Apparently she missed me, then she tried to hug me. I stepped back and made her fall over, laughing.
14grrr
14Same.
14>.<
14Today when my internet activated
14xD
7Never choked on spit, caramel, yes. Essencially the same, just caramel tastes better.
The longest I've gone without internet is about 6 months probably.
14O_O
Omnom
14I couldn't go 1 month without it. It's like a world without people.
I wanna live there!
7... There are so many things wrong with that statement. All of them ending up with you being addicted to the computer.
7(Abbey's comment)
14Well.
I still wanna live there!
14It wasn't you
I still wanna live there!
14I was my friends and here but what really bit me
14I DIDNT GET TO PLAY MY MMO's D'=
House of wax.
The descent.
The saw movies.
30 days of night (Extra long 3 hour version)
14o.O
SAW
Going to watch all those films at a friend's sleepover.
14But oh well there was Tv and .... *shudders* movies
14Especially
14*gulp* FD3!
I think that's around 8 hours of movies.
Final Destination 3 bored me.
4hm
Not bloody enough.
14What! o.O
14O_O
14You need to go to
Also, there were no zombies, or other strange things.
14umm
7Dari: The bloodiest one was the girl who got nail-gunned, yes, no, sausagepanacakes?
7ZOMBEHZ!
14Yeah!#
14>.<
14Then you'll be sane.
7I'mma go test out my new gun packs and map now.... oh yeah.. need to extract the map...
NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
SHARON IS ON

14What about the guy who got crushed by the sign
7O_O THIS MAP IS FOR L4D!

14O_O
14Duuude
14Dude

Why would anyone enjoy watching a Hairy Pauper.
14LOL
That's just boring.
And she talks like Charlie the unicorn unicorns.
14I got bored after Goblet of Fire
4god I remember that video..
7Dari: I downloaded this Gmod map, but it's really for L4D :d
7:D*
2T_T
O_o
14I watch the 5th one without knowing the storyline
WTH?
14All I knew is tha sirus died
14If I spelt that right
I read all the books, the ending sucked.
7It's a breakable house map for Gmod, but the actual map file was built for L4D.
Not enough people died.
MORE DEATH
She goes to Stacey and I's (WTH XD) friend, Charlotte. she goes "Heeeeey Charlie, we're in a schooooooool Charlieee!"
14Dari would the word "Shank" be in your description of yourself?
No.
That's in chav's discriptions.
14LOL
She is NOT a chav
Trust me
She is not a chav
14not her
:P
14She isnt a n00b

Hey Dari.

Cya.
Eat it.
14What the catch?
That its infused with tin.
*it's
14SAY WHA
Err nothing.
Apple has a valency of 2.
14Are you insane or mad?
Or both.
14Here take this bounty bar.
So if apple has a valency of two...
4that was a quick test
So Abbey, you ressurected yourself?
OA i apple oxide.
is*
14EM I never died
7I just remembered, Steam takes fucking ages to load.
^ LOL
14I just grew older.
14LOL
'Course you did.
I HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW ELEMENT!
Apple element.
I know.
14What?
It's YM, or Your Mom
14Darioxide?
Then I made apple oxide.
Since A has a valency of 2.
14=.=
14Dari.
What?
Yes, but if you diluted said apple oxide, couldn't you change the valency (at least in part) to change the afafirs, resulting in a much less dense product?
*affairs
14Take the Magnesium and burn it on a bunsen burner and look at it for 10 minutes and see if you can see anything. >=D
7Abbey just discovered an experiment everyone's already done! ROUND OF APPLAUSE!
Magnesium reactions do not hurt my eyes, also it will not react for 10 minutes, unless you are burning a hell of a lot of magnesium.

13Like what you said to figure her out
Basically, the other accounts were a friend's.
13HAHA what
She didn't want to talk to somebody, so this other guy hacked her first account.
Deleted all her friends and put some shit on.
So she mad a new one.
They attacked thet one too, and screwed it all up.
*that
That's where the "whore" account came from.
Then the third one got hit too I think.
That's it.

13Goldfish falls in love with every female here but me cuz I'm a bitch :D
7Apparently
13O_O
7The 'apparently' was a continuation of my previous post.
13I know
14I'm not getting hit on by anyone.
Gerple just has nothing to do, so he starts drama, tries to get attention, and tries to get with every girl on here because that causes the first two factors.
Yes, Gerple makes his girls twats (if you dont know what that means you are an idiot)
7Abbey: I know, I'm pretty sure that's what makes you angsty all the time.
14Well.
/me 13is an idiot.

14Well
13No he won't
14He hasn't seen my rage
13He talks about how we ruined his life for being so "mean"
And just find sympathy with some one else because of what you say to him.
You have to get out of his Win-Win game.
Bring in another variable.
14I'll break his heart into so many pieces you won't even see them.
13Yay?

Adobe are fucking annoying
Lol.
13Nah
13Kuro is an asskisser though
Not where I am there isnt
Therefore, n00b.
Now Adobe thinks it's activated and don't try to phone home in order to verify the serial n.
Well, all it says is Lisence Expired. Nothing else other than OK
Lol
Optimus Kitten?
4well he prolly thinks you are one too lol...so it doesn't really matter
Well that just proves he's a n00b.
Anyone who thinks I'm a n00b is obviously one.
4why lol...it's their own beliefs just as you have yours lol..does it really matter?
N00bs are always unaware that they are.
I have to wait for a minute
13Lol
7The n00bs can't handle how easily we handle them... if that made sense.
Nothing matters, but if it didn't matter, that would be boring, so it must matter.

Now you care.
Not really.
So you agree that heroes is better than lost?
Ah yes, the all-important infidels.
No.
Then you care.
However, I'm not going to go off on you.
Either you care or you agree heroes is better than lost.
Not so.
Those are your two choices.
There are more choices. We could add more shows in, and that would change things.

ahoy...
7If one day Razz went /way/ too far and we fully teamed up to take her down, and I made my blazing entry to the actual FORUM (in special high definition on channel 275 :P)
14>.<
13lol
7I was joking with /some/ of that...
7But yah.
13She is arrogant though
10NO AHOY!!!!!!!!!!
13She's pissed because she gets "overlooked" and doesn't win contests because she doesn't always color. That's her problem.
7Now then, I wonder, if we take down Razz, do all the worshippors become freed from her control, like in Half-Life, or do they become mindless no-life losers, looking for the next thing to worship, much like zombehz.

4well..I'm not a slob lol...that much I know
5I know. Just that there's none of the mature type in a highscool in Spring, the armpit of houston!
4well that sucks. Isn't much better up here...most guys are druggies
2well its probably just that girls tend to be more mature that boys within their own age group
5See where I'm comin' from, guys?

4just my input as a guy lol
5Oh well.... Can't say I'd much rather want to be in the real world of adulthood which I know for a fact is not much better that this are you're still surrounded by assholes. It's just something that reamains constant throughout one's entire life.
5as**
2back
2hmm
4and like I said..as constant as that is...the assholes will always be there...but the friends that you do find will make up for hard times. And you will find someone that fits you eventually...they are just much harder to find..but it's worth it when you do

4well I keep the ones I find close

hi
13Hello :)
A CHALLENGER APPEARS!
13...
6hi...
XD
Yo
have u been playing pokemon?
Not recently
12D_D
6me yes
Its a reference to Smash Bros, actually
12heh
same thing
sorta
No...
One game is about fighting
And another is about cock-fighting
MAJOR difference
yea
still fighting
In all seriousness
Pokemon is a RPG
6fighting is fun
12heh
Smash Brothers is a Beat 'Em Up
brawl has an rpg
Erm, no
but u get all the chars
It has a Story Mode
Hey Raidon.
That's not a RPG
Its called Story Mode
Hey Dari
its like thirty rpgs in one
A RPG is like turn-based strategy
Huh?
I argue with everyone
This shouldn't be a surprise
Smash is real-time fighting
like rite now
13:/
Oh, yeah
RDX is full of shit
that was uncalled for
12-.-
No, it wasn't
The truth is never uncalled for :P
it sometimes is
6...
No, see
13I am really tempted to kick you.
only when the truth isnt the truth
12do it
He purports that he is privy to this 'grand secret'
Of the real reason we invaded Iraq
Personally I don't see how attacking a country that has nothing to do with it stops attacks, it just means that more people are dying in a different place.
12-.-
I told him, "No, its not."
Here we go ...
And he's like "I can't tell you."
And he never answered me when I asked how that helps.
i never said i cant tell you
I called him out, and he is unable to back up his story
That is true, Dari
6STOP FIGHTING!!
We're not fighting...?
Dari and I agree
Funny, amirite?

Stupid glitchy crap.
Its like saying that it should win
it aint that bad
Be victorious

Etc
I hate Vista

Yes, it is
it uses 3x ammount of ram than xp
I have XP on this laptop
Glaring security flaws suck
but if ur rich thats not a poblem
I'm not

6...
then it is a problem xD
Okay, well, I am
But I don't want to spend my monies on a laptop :P
*repair
get a pc then
Got one
XD
You can't pay for more slots.
Oh
You need to get a big box for that
well on my hp i could have gotten 320gb ram
Seen the foot-stool sized computers?
but thats such a waste
and i could have gotten 10tb
when am i gonna use all that
Using an external hardrive as RAM?
10 terabyte in a LAPTOP?
no
Oh
If you're doing video editing
:P
10 Terabytes is awesome
its a waste
Video takes up a fuckton of space
its like 2 mil calculations to the moon and back every millisecond
Seriously
Its like
Things: Heheheh.
Three hours of video is a hundred gigs
i have lotsa movies
That depends on the filetype
And how its compressed
dark knight on my computer is 2 gigs..
How do you know that?
i dont
its just a guess
its a clever metaphor
Assumptions are bad.
Its probably not an editable video though
I mean actual video editing
It's not clever if it's almost definitely wrong.
what i mean to say is 10tb is a waste of money
Ripped video and whatnot
Is huge
I'd kill for 10 terabytes
how many programs u have?
Idk, I don't keep count
i only use my cpu for games xD
Well, today I downloaded another 5 programs, bringing the count up to 54329898 different programs.
I use my comp for everything
who has a 360?
Not me
Xbox FTL
Xbox is total crap

Xbox will overheat after 3 hours...
Wii can be left on for weeks.

microsoft didnt care to fix anything on the xbox
Xbox live may have proper servers (Microsoft at least did that well), but 30 a month is total crap.

Diablon was a fun boss.
7I never completed STH, each storyline bored me and when I tried to do good I had to beat a mother-fucking tank, ON THE SECOND LEVEL! Then when I failed to do that, I had to fight this even MORE mother-fucking boss!
7Then my bro went to uni and took his PS2 with him
LOL
I beat almost all the sroylines, but some I didn' bother because they were just hard as hell.

If I were a newb to Sonic I would believe that was real.
It's not a real tailer.
*trailer
7No shit
Well you acted like it was lol.
I was correcting you.
:P
7Fine then, lemme type it out the PROPER way: It's a fan-trailer made by riptide designed around the events of SA2 to show off its pure epicness. Happy now? If you look.. not closely, hell, if you just LOOK, you can see the change in graphics between the SA2 bits on the sonic next-gen bits.
Haha I know, iw as even pointing out the games lol.
13mornin
You can't turn this around and act like i thought it was real.

Whatever his political views are are his own business

Haha.
10with numbers.
10ooooo
Thanks.
10?
For killing that magmarth of course.
He would've killed me.
Well if the dynamic turning point of an anti-gravitational field, acting upon the stratosphere of an anhydrous solid, which has been exposed to the radiation produced by biochemical nuclear waste was to spontaneously combust, leaving you with an endless supply of carcinagenic energy waves, how would you fix the problem? I cannot see that it is fixable, as the hypothesis that endless waves of energy, which is in a hydronucleic form, can be stopped using any form of enzyme is preposterous, yet if the hadron collider was to be infused with genetically enhanced biobacteria, using exothermic reactions to heat the intersect, you might, just might be able to distort the waves out of proportion, allowing them to split harmlessly into the atmosphere. Although the question would be, how can you genetically enhance the bacteria to allow them to create enough glycerin as is needed?
Well yes, I am crazy, although, isn't everyone?
I'll leave you with that question.
Hm
Did that get cut off?
13Yes
10yes.
Yes.
Where?
13"Can be stopped us"
"can be stopped us--"

13HEY!
Still cut off?
No.
Dari it's fine.
10What, 'your face'?
I wonder what he'll make of that.
No, the message I just posted.
Woah Dari
13roar.
I actually learned one new word from that.
10yeah, I knew that, I was just playing. duh.
Anhydrous.... nice.
10Hmm, never heard that one before
13ARE YOU OK!? D:
13:P
Hello earthlings.
12Stupid insects made me look fat.
?
13O___O
13Ha
13*Hai
7Hello Martian
12 just want some PANTS. A DECENT PAIR OF PANTS!...and maybe your blood, but mostly the PANTS
10O.O
Ooh, bloood...
13...........
^ XD
I think vampires should be magnetic.
Because of so much iron?
I mean, with all that blood in them, which has iron in it.
^ I wiN!
It all adds up.
Haha.
7Dari: Just like cornflakes. :P
No, crunchy nut.
I can see the leftover iron after eating crunchy nut.
Like how Magneto escaped from the plastic prison XD
It's weird.
Cornflakes ruined my life at age 6
^ O RLY?
12That's nice dear.
13O RLY
7Actually, vampires generally have less blood than humans at any one time. That's why they need to feed upon human blood so regularly. After a particularly big feeding, with a gi-fucking-normous magnet, maybe.
Hm.
Oi
They take in more than they lose, I bet.
=P
Because otherwise their body temp. would go far too low.
13boredz.....
Theoretically
>_>
7:P
^ Yeah.
10But iron isnt a magnet....... it's magnetic. ;)
7I think we're reading too much into this
^ We established that way earlier.
10or have I got the wrong term? AAHHH
@DB
10But whatever.
13....
Vampires are overused nowadays.
13blahhhhhhhrg.
10Especially in twilight
Indeed.
7Let's have a random question! How did they make the first magnet (yes, I know a magnet is created by aligning the domains into one direction, but to do that you need ANOTHER magnet)?
12F*** tha poh-leece!
13Twilight sucks now...
They found them.
They were within naturally-occuring rocks.
I learned it last year.
There was an actual person credited with the discovery i think.
7^ Like Star Wars?
7:P
XDDDD
7Although Star Wars is epic enough to be forgiven
Lawl.
12I FOUND AN ALTERNITIVE TO PAYPAL!
7The Earth isn't a magnet, it just has a magnetic field.
^ Truth
Magnetic field pulls in metal.
= Magnetic.
There are virtually no magnetic rocks within the earth.
Molten Iron.
I mean really within.
^ Is it magnetic?
Lots and lots of molten iron.
10We're in a bit of pickle here are we not?
If it's molten?
10Dari is magnetic?!
7Heat destroys magnetism. I say molten iron is hot enough for that to happen.
/me feels so nerdy right aboutn now.
10O>O
OK.
10O.O*
I agree.
7Heat destroys magnetism. I say molten iron is hot enough for that to happen.
10*O.O*
Read my last thing.
So what happens if the iron stops spinning round...?
Well actually there was a crappy film about that.
10Which was...?
And in the end we all die, except in the film they saved us.
Stupid retards.
What happens you ask?
10?
A movie lot of course!
*plot
10Hm.
10Never heard of it
We watched it in Geography...
Hahaha.
wat
Basically the iron stopped spinning, everything went crazy.
World was going to end.
And they started it spinning again by nuking it.
O_o
7Nuking iron makes it rotate?
XDDDDD
10Anyone seen 30 Days of Night?
EPIC FAIL MOVIE
Well if the moon drifted away we'd probably end up dying.
Should have thought about that before alerting me :P
Since the moon controls the sea partially.
7Wouldn't setting off a nuke so far underneath the Earth's surface totally screw it up MORE?
And other stuff.
And it was more like 5 nukes.
7Yes, but we wouldn't lost all gravity if the moon drifted away
10apparently the moon moves 3cm away from the earth every year, soon it'll just go PING and zoom away into oblivion. XD
I think it'd cause more problems and with a slight chance of correcting the main one.
XD
They dropped the nukes, they were placed around the core.
And one exploded, then the next exploded, etc.
10Anyone seen 30 Days of Night?
Which apparently created movement.
How did they gte the nukes that far down without they being incinerated?
They should attach the moon to Earth with a rope.
*them
^ HAHA
7Has no-one seen the Dr. Who episode where they threatened to blow up the Earth with strategically placed NUKES underneath the EARTH'S SURFACE? Now surely, something more like the earth goed boom would happen than it fixing the problem
I see.
Although it couldn't go through diamond.
And gradually all of them die.
I don't watch Dr. WHo.
Leaving 2 people.
Nor do I plan to.
Yep.
Haha.
13.....................................
13bored.
WELCOME HOME NEW ADAM AND EVE LULZ
12Then do something.
Diamond > All
13like what.
Diamonds cut diamonds.
So...
12Umm......
7Diamons > nukes?
7diamonds*
Diamons?
:P
Diamonds > Wires connecting nuke to power source.
13Umm? I don't know how to "umm".
^ I do.
?
^ !
13?
13???
13??????
13???????????????????????????????????????????????????!??????????????????????????????????????????????????
You made stairs.
13YEY
7Dari: No, that's changing the point. I said "Diamonds > nukes?", not "Diamonds > wires?"
13I'M A BIG KID NOW
13:D
Diamond > Disarmed nuke.
12Dance with bob, he's in this meadow, and he sells microw wave popcorn.
WHy did you question anyway?
Diamond can disarm armed nuke.
^ really?
7Again, that's changing the point
How do you figure that?
13I DON'T WANNA DANCE WITH BOB
12Stop crying yo me!
12*to
13Well WAH
13>>
12..........
/me 13flees
Dari: How do diamonds disarm nukes?
12NO WAIT!
No it isn't, because nuke maybe greater than diamond when armed, but diamond can unarm nuke, then diamond owns nuke.
13What?
XD
/me 13has a hand on the doorknob to the closet
7Not "Diamonds > disarmed nukes" but "Diamonds > nukes?", you keep changing the point because you said "Diamonds > all" and now you realise that diamons do NOT > all and you keep trying to change it.... so a magic diamond golem disarms the nuke?
Why are diamonds even in question?
13...
13Well Icy?
13What?
Diamonds > Nuke
Nuke cannot blow up diamond.
Nuke blows up self.
12Don't run.
Diamond therefore > Nuke
13Why?
12Or I'll kill a puppy.
LEAVE THE PUPPIES ALONE

ok
I just set my brother up a simple PC
I took my old eeepc that has a busted screen and attached an old CRT monitor, usb mouse, and usb keyboard to it
its pretty kick ass
installed Tiny XP rev 5
want to come over to my house and do the same

Thats all you need, go buy a busted eeepc off ebay for $70 then buy a new LCD monitor
and there you go.
If I was willing to do it I prolly would lol
Theres no actual work that involves knowing anythign about computers really
well I just don't want to spend money right now lol...otherwise I would buy a whole new setup
that and I'm just busy with other payments
I need a new motherboard for the old computer.
It screwed up.

btw SR how did that questionare thing go for you?...the one that you asked me about
I just shot my brother with a $10 airsoft gun
and he called me an asshole and shut his door

It will leave you with the selected area.
We were dressed and ready to go out for the New Years Eve Party. We turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on, covered our pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. We phone the local cab company and requested a taxi. The taxi arrived and we opened the front door to leave the house. The cat we put out in the back yard, scoots back into the front door. We didn't want the cat shut in the house bec
My wife goes out to the taxi, while I went inside to get the cat. The cat runs upstairs, with me in hot pursuit. Waiting in the cab, my wife doesn't want the driver to know that the house will be empty for the night. So, she explains to the taxi driver that I will be out soon, 'He's just going upstairs to say Goodbye to my mother.'
A few minutes later, I get into the cab. 'Sorry I took so long,' I said, as we drove away. 'That stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come
out! She tried to take off, so I grabbed her by the neck. Then, I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked! I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard!'
The cab driver hit a parked car.

And, what are you laughing about, which you shouldn't be?
4lol
13Go on SF, and look in the topics "Annoying Girl" and "The Talk About Anything Thread"
I've left something like 5 pieces of homework to do in 3 hours before school, hah.
4our lovely religious zealot
Year of the Ox? O_o
13"I have sinned. Please forgive me, my heart has been attacked by demons. "
WTH?

4which thread is it lol
13"Annoying Girl"
13OMG
13HAHA
13ARE YOU SERIOUS
Yes.
"Thou shalt not use God's name in vain."
/me 13lols so hard she falls out of her chair
4oi
4holy shit
10Hi
4I can't tell if he is beeing serious or not lol
4or if he is doing it to spite you
13Which is so fricken sad
13xD
4hmmm
4should I go in and do damage control :P lol
Lol.
13God I feel terrible laughing at this guy but I can't help it
/me 10has no clue what everyone is talking about
Watch
her peers carefully, and don't let them hurt your sister's soul.
LOL WTH
13He called me a "_____"
13I mean WTF is that
4oi
4bitch I think
13XD
13"I have sinned. Please forgive me, my heart has been attacked by demons. "
/me 10knows what everyone is talking about
4or some swear word that he is already going to hell for because he was thinking it in his mind :D
I could swear you only pray to God, not Jesus...
4oi...
13LOL
10x)
wat
i need to like
hang out on the forums more or something
<-- fails
10xD
4alright...
Well I'm going to write a speech for Geography now, back later.
4there I gave him a comforing post of some sorts
thats like their positive thing
you cant blame people for believing in what they want to :S
13Well, he seems to turn anything (even if it is nothing near religious) into something about God or Jesus.
like I said, thats kind of their thing
10Oh, perfect timing. There are people talking about God on TV.
/me 10changes channel
my friend does it all the time too
4hm
4well after that nice little ramble of his I don't think he will be on for awhile
just try to be more open-minded than everyone else, I've found it helps
4now that he thinks "demons" have attacked his heart 0.o
/me 10snickers
DEMANS
13Mage: I've dealt with him long enough. When he joined in the summer, he'd told me that I was going to hell. I've tried to ignore many of his posts about his religion, but I'm at the end of my rope now. I am an open-minded person, but I've had enough of him harassing me and other members with his posts.
2"Demons over there, KILL THEY ASS!"
2heh
LOL
well eh.. PM him about it?
most situations dont have to be resolved on public forums xD
4they shouldn't be....and that's prolly what it has come to now
10Man... how can a "demon" attack your heart anyways?
10And your heart pumps blood throughout your body, it doesn't control your emotions/what youd o
13It's the "magic of the bible"
13=P
10*you do
4it's his beliefs
4nothing we can do to change them
10xDDDDD
i guess the same way a giant man loves us all yet still likes to watch us suffer
10xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
LOL ^
even if he did exist, I wouldnt follow that guy, hes kind of twisted
13And like how a giant man loves us all yet wants more than half of the population to "burn in hell"
10Besides, a "demon" would have to be able to (somehow) slip into the bloodstream
13Yes, of course, he loves EVERYONE
10Bahahahaha
AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
4lol
:(
10noooo!
13And, the reason that I brought it into the topic instead of PM, is because I confronted him in PM once before, yet he refused to listen to me. I want him to know that I am serious.
/me 10nods
10O_O Maybe they hide in our food
10Or NEEDLES
10Flu shots don't give you the flu. They inject demons into your VEINS.
10xD
13Yeah
13Ahaha
its almost like he realises how insane he sounds
10"God really will help"
13hah..
10Then why doesn't he do something about Global Warming?
13I feel terrible laughing at him, but I just can't help it.
10Why are there wars?
<Mage> i guess the same way a giant man loves us all yet still likes to watch us suffer
Oh and there are arugments for this kind of thing ^
yeah I know
Ive seen a lot of them
brb for a little
The one for that is that if we are given freedom to do as we want, there will always be murderers, people who steal, etc.
10" If you don't want to believe in the bleepin truth, then keep your crap to yourself" "Back off and give people some freedom to share the real truth"
10*snort*
13That's what really pissed me off.
10Same, and it wasn't even directed at me
I tend just to ignore overly religous people, rather than argue with them.
4no point in arguing
4you are not going to change anything
4when we all die then you will no
I know they have their beliefs, I have mine, I can't say anything to change their beliefs.
4"know"
4not before
4all you can do is live how you see fit
13I wasn't attempting to change his beliefs.
4I know you were not
13I've just had enough of him bringing it into everything and harassing the others
Yes, but they will see it as that. :/
4that's just how I view religious arguements and such as a whole
So I just ignore them.
13He needs to know when to stop.
4we will not know until we die
10Every other post of his includes "God" or "Jesus"
13^indeed
4eh...maybe he is trying to cleanse himself with holy water right now...
13...lol
10I don't even get how you can make water "holy"
13It's just water I'm guesing.
13WIth salt in it or something
13*guessing, With
10Bahaha
13Because apparently it burns
13SO
13Water with salt?
13In your eyes?
13Idk?
10Oh, I saw this one person's fan character (dragon), and it's element was "salt water"
2ouch
2heh
10xDDD
4it's water
4that they put in a church
4and it's considered "holy"
2hehe'
It's probably considered holy because a priest/bishop has blessed it.
By saying some prayer or other.
4it's just like marketing....it's presented that way as to cater to the beliefs...nothing more
/me 10sighs
2heh
It doesn't really count as marketing, as no one sells "Holy water".
2eh
Does holy water even exist...?
10Isn't it supposed to burn demons or something like that?
2"It's like smoking a cactus.."
4but what do I know...again it's all personal views..nothing we can do about it
4okay lol
10Well said
10Ooh
/me 10goes to read the post
4that's good
/me 10busts up laughing
4hopefully he isn't fully possesed by demons to get on the internet again lol
10Bahahahaha... oh... man....
13scroll down
10*snort*
back
13Welcome back.
13brb, HULK NEED SODA
/me 10snorts again
10...Hi...
LOL
LOLOLOL
BURN HER!
:P
13:P
13XD
10If he feels so horrible why doesn't he just apologize?
LOL ^
10Instead of asking someone to pray for him...
Good point.
Very good point.
13"Well what do you know...a girl solved a math problem! You know what that means...A WITCH!!!"
Ego?
4cause he is bathing in holy water
4trying to cleanse his soul
I worked out what holy water is.
If I recall youre supposed to ask GOD for forgiveness, and keep to yourself about it
/me 10prepares herself for a very corny joke
at least thats what they taught me
They get a bishop to pee in water, which makes it holy.
hahaha gross
10x(.... x)... xDDDDDDDD
Mage: Depends whether you are catholic or protestant really.
I was raised lutheran so i wouldnt know actually ha

When I found out that Nestl had been selling powder milk to mothers in poor countries, which are already too poor to afford it, quite frankly, I was shocked and disgusted. I thought that this company would be better than this, yet it is endangering lives for money. There are some of the reasons as to why you should stop.
With formula milk you need to mix it with water, and many of the countries in which the powder milk is sold do not have clean water, which can lead to children getting diseases, especially as infants are very vulnerable, and will end up with many unnecessary deaths.
Another reason is that as many of the mothers buying the formula milk are so poor, they use even less of the formula as is needed, to make it last longer, resulting in some children not receiving enough nutrients, because its too weak.
Also, the formula milk doesnt contain many of the natural benefits that breast milk does, such as some nutrients and antibodies, which provide somewhat of a protection for many illnesses, such as, diarrhea, bacterial meningitis, gastroenteritis, ear infections, and respiratory infection. Breast milk also contains the right amount of nutrients for development of the brain and nerves.
I think that's enough.

Ending sentence.
Woo.

Mcdonalds is total crap.
KFC and Burger King come second.
Mcdonalds is off the scale, in t he bad direction.
McDonald's is indeed crap.
KFC is my fav
Although it has a lot of help because it was one of the first.
^ LIES
Common hardware errors, expensive games which are crap, disks are often damaged while being played, Xbox live (No need to explain this), it makes loads of noise, overheats, expensive, games freeze often, sometimes doesn't even detect the games.
The list goes on.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQL0vIdq3nY LOL
Includes Jack Black
Not for the Arcade, which I have. I disagree. Only when the console is tipped over. Xbox Live is amazing, actually, although it should be free. and for those last four they were corrected within the first 2 running years. It's the cheapest of the three currwnt generation consoles.
*current
Never heard of that happening.
And Xbox live is crap.
^ Explain.
Slow speeds, their servers are crap, they make you pay for extra things too.
OMG SAFFIE!
13Hey Dari: http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=252650#252650

13oh, and...
13lolololol
I never have lag with wii online games.
Play locally if your connection is that slow.
Never seen anyone lag.
XD
It isn't your connection.
Well mine is fine.
I've never had anything be slow on Live.
As I said, depends on how far you are from the people you are playing.
And it is nothing to do with your connection.
O RLY?
It's server side.

Seeya.
yeah there was no way i was getting the Snuffleupagus one ^^
13Obviously not.
13Demons are fake.
13:P
OK, so even if demons are fake as you say, what about spirits, like dead people.
?
13They don't exist either.
ALright, so here and now is all there is?
13And if they did, there are no such thing as "evil" spirits
^ Is there evil in people?
13Evil is nothing but a state of mind.
OK, so even if it is, if there are evil people there must be evil in a spirit, as a state of mind.
7Evil is nothing but opinion. What one considers to be evil, the 'evil' person considers to be right and wholeful.
^ I agree.
I'm not even talking baout that anymore.
Bear with me I wanna pick your brain.
*about
OK, so even if it is, if there are evil people there must be evil in a spirit, as a state of mind.
AGreed?
13Nope.
But you're defying your own logic then.
13Nope.
Then explain.
13I don't do the whole "spirit" shit, so no, and there are no evil people.
13Why do you care about my views?
Alright.
I care because it matters.
Hmm.
13:/
13Whatever
OK.
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
I just got ina right fuss over nothing
LOl.
7So, same as normal?
Also, for the record, I don't believe in spirits. But yes, I know demons are real. [/end]
I was screaming and cursing that I had lost one of my favourites songs and ripped my bag looking for my USB stick and it was still on iTunes
^ XD
I screamed when I found it
Now I need to find a new bag
Why would you care that much about a song anyway?
:P
13I do
NO, I mean, even if you lost one song it would be quite easy to get back.
*No
13Why buy a song again when you bought it before?
13That's one less new song to get
I don't buy songs :P
I don't think a dollar is worth screaing about is all I'm saying.
*screaming
It's off a CD
^ Your point?
^My point being that
Your point is flimsy then.
Because screaming and ripping open your bag for one song that you could get back with little effort isn't worth freaking out about.
IMO.
13Ripping songs off of CDs on iTunes DOES take forever though...I gotta new one I need to rip..
I have to rip nearly 20 Disks
My dad bought a stack of 50
JUST FOR A QUID!
Yeah, how much :P
How new :P
13hm?
/me laughs because now they are arguing about who has ripped more songs from disks.
Hoooooow
13HOOOOOW!
.....I still have more Os
Well, regardless, you're arguing now.
XD
I'm not complaining, I just can't be bothered

10wtf?
10my room smells like biscuits

The werewolves seem more dangerous than the vampires, although the werewolves only transform once a month.

Awesome =S
!rankall
Lol.
-20000 ftw
10No, I meant included. ^_^
That does not make grammatical sense.
Also, do any of your understand this?
Let's just agree that although the probability of anyone having not done something which is almost undeniably the most heinous act of crime that could be committed by anyone of that caliber, such as the ambiguous job of cleaning the sewers, which are then flooded with nuclear waste, morphing your cells, and completely changing your genetic code, is a most unlikely act compared to the cookie theft of which I suspect you all of committing. Therefore you shall all be sentenced to death by German dictionary, very very thick German dictionary. Enjoy your time on death row, also your last meal will consist of cookies, namingly of the doughy, chocolaty sort, yet laced with hidden ingredients such as arson, and others, ensuring you a slow and painful death.
Did that get cut off?
13"Therfore y"
7Yes
13So yes.

10yes.
10"Therefore y"
7Also, you lost me around "Let's".
How can I lose you on the first word?
7Skillz in a sausage roll (mai skillz)
That's not skillz.
10I'm confundled.
7Dari: I was being sarcastic
I can never tell with you.
10sausage roll?
10ooh.
7Dari, need you to do me a favour (not a hax favour)
10"You couldn't stalk me, I'm a ninja. You'd think you were stalking me and all of a sudden I'd tap you on the shoulder and f*ck you."
7Tommorow remind me to go on Yarolds
Ok, if you tell me Yarolds is.
13Oh my God.
7It's a click exchange. Click links = get credits = get clicks for the link/s you posted.
Oh right.
Ok.
7I've been lazy the past few days and forgetting to go on it = my dragonadopters thing doesn't grow up
Also I meant arsenic, not arson.
10Dari: No.
What?
10Idk, I just felt like saying no.
...O_o
10"Gibbons, what are you doing in my wallet?!" Epic
I'm bored.

Well?
Kiss.
4lol
7Dari, you can't be the vicar if you're the bride
Good thing I'm not the bride.
7Hmmm. You can deny it, it's your name on the wedding certificate
That's a forged wedding certificate.
7If you say so
I do say so, and I'm right.
7kiss*
7either
What, you're his new husband.
I just married you two.
7You know, it's generally custom for the other person to agree to a marriage
I'm not your average vicar.
Priest*
4Wait, what?
You know a divorce costs a lot of money, and as I'm not your average priest, it costs about 200% extra.
7... Why would we pay you for a divorce? Surely a divorce is for the legal system?
I do that too.
You have to sign these files.
LOL
"nice picture by the way whats slipknot"

THat's if we choose to continue
Haha
Not really a laughing matter.
I have one ICT lesson a week
It is crap but that is why I have to do TWO units of my OCR in my own time

I had to crawl under desks, get behind cabnits where the computer had been put and plug in the speakers into the audio jack >.>
AND THEY STILL DIDN'T WORK!

And I wacked my head once which was quite an achievment
7Being a prat is an achievment nowadays?
7Oh yeah, my form got to /pick/ the music for the school disco next week or whenever. I don't intend to go, since school discos are boring and gay, so I put 10 of the WORST songs on there I could think of. I only know one Linkin Logs song though so I had to think a bit on the last three or four
3booring
OOOOOH ITS AAAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING

Good :P
7No-one cares
13:P
7'Specially me
even if i leave
u would miss me ;p
7And C7, hell, I'm trying to make her harbour hate towards you (I've never encountered someone too nice to harbour hatred. Turning her to the Dark Side will be my greatest work so far). And no, I would NOT miss you. Why the hell do you think I've been trying to GET RID OF you?
hmm?
7That's it ignorant goldfish. You ignore it
ok?...
7I HATE doing that
yea...
You can't get rid of the goldfish. :P
It's like that cat in the hat.
The goldfish is annoying as hell, but you NEED the goldfish.
did i replace malefor?..
7Yes. I prefer malefor.
Seriously?
I prefer Gerple.
Malefor's religiousness is too annoying.
13Yalp.
dari on the SF with RP games
he always play spyro
He makes Spyro religious.
but he always overdo it and that not fun
Religious Spyro, creepy.
13Malefor throws wooden cross at Spyro. "CONVERT SPYRO, CONVERT!"
anyways
i bet malefor hadt better gramamr then i do
grammar*
7Yes. I was beginning to beat all his n00byness out of him until some traitor drove him away.
who is that traitor? ;\
Gerple: He didn't have better grammar when he first came here. :/
7No. I forced him to improve.
7He was intelligent enough to know he couldn't beat me
lol
anyways my english on school isnt bad -.-
i'm the best of my class but yea i only have nubcake,s in mah class
they prever deutch
well i still don't know when to use than ;\
When to use what? "Than"?
but yea i really almost g2g cuz my mom is getting mad
brb ganna get my kitten
bck
i ate to musch candy my tonqeu is black XP
Well Malefor is actually English, so Gerple's improvement is still better than Malefor's.
7Actually, factoring in that, they're about equal
Malefor.
I suppose.
Kalefor is much more fun.
*Failfor.
7But this is a purely statisitcal point of view. Malefor is more fun to poke, less of a drama queen, and with more understandable messages
Malefor is more annoying.
^ Exactly.
With his egotistical religious crap.
If we really wanted to, we could mold Failfor into a very effective vicegrip.
7Yes, but I was managing to tone that down in him before he left. He was my little pet n00b.
WHo left?
13<malefor> vamprs r only gud wen they luv jesus!!!1!!11111
7Malefor
He didn't leave.
7The chat anyway
Unless you mean left for today.
7Gerple: A pimple on the face of spyrochat
XD
;\
OMGSH SPIROCHT HAZ A FASE!!!!!!111????//??
^ Not my idea.
XD
7Dari: /New/ members.
7Gerple is no longer a /new/ member
I still don't think SR will be happy if you drive away any members.
7If we bring back Malefor it'll be the same number, with a slightly less n00by n00b.
ERGH
i know tryed fails -.-

7The Guitar Interlude is a total bitch though
That song on expert is easy.
:P
13Linkin Logs suck.
7To someone who hadn't played Guitar Hero in months and had to work his way back up on easy? Not so much the first few times on each difficulty, except easy. On medium that Guitar Interlude totally screwed me up the first time, then I began to play excessively, now it's boring.

4No, he hasn't
4How'd he even get here?
He joined and came stright to Chat guess.
*I guess
You don't have to have an account on SF to get here, Ruri.
4What I meant was that how did he find this site
4literally
7Lol
7My reputation preceeds me
Not really.
It's only Ruri.
7Oh well
7I don't really give a fuck
7
7Stupid keybord

And it is possible that he found the server, and then found the channel, Ruri. Although I doubt it. Kek.
HE SED TEH KEK
Oh... oh no --not again. Graaaaaahhh...
meh
hellow?
Hello.
meh
I CANT HELP BUT LAUGH AT THAT PREP

Right, here's the jizz

13o________________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
7Huh?
Poor poor lottie had an accident on the chair in French and she ran off to "Get Changed" in the bathroom, Abbey, Maisey and I were sitting down finishing our work -___- and Atlanta (A fucking prep who is a right girly shit) asked for a rubber. Maisey was mucking around next to that very chair and dropped the rubber in the blood. She didn't know that atlanta needed the rubber so she just put it on the table. Abbey gave Atlanta t
Did that get cut off?
http://www.spyroforum.com/gem.gif
7Yes it did
Abbey gave Atlanta t
Abbey gave Atlanta the rubber and both didn't know what it was covered in. Atlanta used it and she ate soon after without washing her hands XD
4Define rubber
A small round object made of rubber to erase pencil marks
4Ah
I was loling my head off because I knew EXACTLY what was going on XD
7Who the fuck names their daughter after a city?
13Lol
The retards that had that preepy little shit
*preppy
And I have proof that her mum is a slut
But I don't have the picture with me
7Oh, you got a picture of you and her together?
4AHA
No
The little shite took a picture of her mum to school today
4I think Gerple finally realized no one wnats to talk to him
13lol
If anyone drives away the goldfish, we will need a new goldfish, so whoever drives him away becomes the new goldfish.
13nu uh
13:P
Yep. :P
4kek
meh?
...
7Dari: I do not agree with your earlier statement and am therefore not bound by it.
I don't care if you agree or not, the goldfish must be replaced.
And I shall treat you as the goldfish, should it be your fault the current goldfish leaves.
7Hah. If you wish the goldfish to be replaced, then you can become the goldfish. I had my little pet n00b that SOMEONE drove away, so now I'm driving away yours. A new n00b will come along anyway, they always do.
No, you shall be the goldfish, as the one who drives the goldfish away shall replace the goldfish.
It is not that I wish for the goldfish to be replaced, it is that it must be replaced.
7Ok then, you completely ignore what I've said like a good little goldfish
A good goldfish would listen to what you have said, idiot.
7Not by goldfish standards though. A normal goldfish would completely ignore what you say in an argument and then try and claim you're the stupid one because IT doesn't understand what you just said.
Gerple would just forgoet every 3 seconds.
*forget
That does not make it a good goldfish.
There is no such thing as a good goldfish.
7See? Like you're doing now!
We're combating between goldfish morals/
meh
Hey/
You are disregarding what I'm saying.
My orange-texted goldfish.
Your text suits your position.
3So I must be envious, eh>
3?
éhh?
3No accents on letters!
7Dari, no matter what you say I will not become the new goldfish, and my text was orange long before gerple started to realise that the internet WASN'T just for child porn!
3:P
3Lawl it's OK n00b.
You will become the new goldfish should you drive away the old one.
3dun w0ry gaiz it k
3XDDDD
3"Your avatar is a picture of a kitten. -.- That makes it impossible for you to have suicidal thoughts." LOL
4lol
4Go away
*sigh* stupid homework -.-
meh?
3Homeowrk isn't real, Gerple. Everyone in you life lied to you about irt.
3It simply doesn'te xist.
3^ Epic n00bish
That help mod called whiskers is an idiot.
3Haha I agree.
3^ no urrrrrrrrrrr teh n00000b
3!!!1111
If I was a mod I would ban them for the reason "Didn't kill themselves sooner".
dari ban who?
Nevermind.
*sigh*
4LOL
4That'sm cruel Dari
4and Worser is not a word
I don't care.
They shouldn't cry on the internet.
3But sdon't think I'm not elated about this.
3:D
dun be stupid
3I called you a n00b so I ruiend your day? XDDDD

3Am I supposed to care, or make you some oatmeal?

Lol
3There is no line if goldfish succession.
3XD
4I tend to stay away from people like that. When I got a review for a story, I had trouble reading it becuase ther was this huge wal of text of internet slang with no periods
13lol
3*of

4I saw that
3Haha that's what i thought.
3I was thinking of giving it to Majikal.
4I own like every episode of House...when he does that, it cracks me up
My dad would kill you
4Like to see him try
He wants those episodes
And partly so do I
But not as much as he would
4Tell him to go buy them like I did
4Prefer Supernatural over House, but meh
No one supllies them here

7Nope!
grr
10WOO!
7CAEK <3
Cake does not exist.
I will not explain again.
I've already explained twice.
7Yes, but caek does
caek = 1337 version of cake, 1337 version = n00b version
What's the significance of 1337?
1337 in 1337 = leet
7Caek and even it's more powerful form cæk are paralell versions of cake, and therefore are not 1337/n00b, and THEREFORE EXIST! SO SUCKIT
Ah.
I forget they use 1 as leet.
*l
parallel versions of cake only exist in parallel worlds.
yeayea?
Yup, and if cake was ever real, you'd die.
10Cake does exist
By real I mean atruth.
7Dari: And this is a 'parallel' world. This world is as parallel to all other parallel worlds as they are parallel to us.
^ Heresy!
10But I didnt have any because I don't like it.
10THE END.
10Thank you.
But what about your berfday caek?
It only exists in a parallel world to this world, meaning a parallel of this world, this may be a parallel of other worlds.
But in this world we have cake.
7SO THE CAKE DOES EXIST!
7HAH
Yes, but it is made of light.
So is virtually a lie.
7Jesus, 4 minutes >=/
As I have explained.
Let me explain again.
:P
And is a lie.
;\
*raises ahnd*
*hand
OMG
in a anime they just sayd
show them your stuff yowie WTF
I have a question.
Now if the light is beign refracted into the appiarition of true cake, what would eb the purpose?
*being
*apparition
7IT DOEN!
Well there is no true cake.
Or is there?
Only caek, which exists only in parallel universes.
*eats cake*
And thus I cannot say to you what the results would be.
/j #dm
/j #trivia
non u
dari would u like a piece of cake?
I cannot have a piece of what does not exist.
Bored.
i wanna play poker X]
My poker skillz > yours

Stupid mIRC
hello
Halo.
KJ
Glad you're here.
I need your Brawl code.
7Meh
u dunw ant???`////
NAO
Hm.
Hallo thar Mage.
13rawr
Ahhh!!!
13lol
13hi
Iw ould be.
He won't guve me his code.
Lol, why?
His reply was "Meh"/
I could get it out of him.
Ok.
"You're a n00b, I bet I'd beat you at brawl."
He would respond to that.
Yeah.
Alright.
I beat him at MKW.
MKW?
I thrashed him.
Mario Kart Wii.
Mortal Kombat?
Oh OK.
Kewl.
Never played him at brawl though.
Do you have Brawl?
Yep.
And GHWT
I'll give you mah code.
Kewl.
And GH3.
And lots of other games
.
Sw33t.
You have any Guitar hero games?
I recently started using the Wiimote for Brawl, since the GC controller is much easier.
Nop.e
I never had a gamecube, so I don't have gamecube controllers.
Mhm.
I bet the Classic Controlelrs would work well too.
13I love gamecube
13and nintendo64
13but Wii = no
...
3995-6281-4851
Wii > Gamecube + N64
^ Yup[
It has sold more than both of them put together I think.
And I have an N64 emulator on my Wii :P
^ Haha.
Thanks to TP hack.
:P
OK.
13Probably because fitness freaks/soccer moms want their kids to play the stupid sports games
The sport games suck.
I only like the bowling and Tennis.
And even then I sold the frickin' game for like 3 dollars, becaus seriously it's like worth nothing. (Wii Sports)
13I doubt that "Wii Fit" even does anything. "Ooh, look at me, I'm staning on a square thinking that I'm exercising, YAAAAAY"
My dad has it, and it's decently fun, but I doubt it's good for exercise...
:P
13What about Wii Clean the House
13Wii Vaccuming
XDDDD is that real?
13Wii Work
JK
13Wii Office

13:/
13LOL
That'd be hilarious if they made a Wii poddy...
But seriosuly that's insane.
13I mean they already have Wii Cooking
13What's next
WiNoWriMo
13Wii Read a Book
13Wii school
13Wii writing
13Wii math

Nah, the Pii is the new Portable wii.
They actually have an Animal Corssing arena in brawl. XDDD
*crossing
Wii Burn
^ :P
13Wii Pii 4 Fun for kids!
13I can so imagine that as a commercial..
It's "incorrect."

This is what I get for asking my sister to read it out...
Hahaha.

Join on me whenever.
It just came up with "Hosting" then you stopped it.
It was about to start.
It wouldn't ahve worked.
10 secs
Started again.
3 stock good?
Hahab good agme
*game
Lol
Good game again
Curses.
I suck with Toon Link anyway.
Haha.
Lucky.
Hey daaaaaaaaaariiiiiiiiiiii
I need your chat thingy
I have sound effects for my microphone and they only come up in proper webcam use
I'm done.
Pah, use the best brawl character. :P
Kirby sucks.
That's why I won 5 out of 7.
So?
Because of your character chouice.
(choice
You used meta knight for most of the games.
And he is well known as the best character.
:P
Apparently he's banned from contests.
I used a variety, but then realized I'd have to actually trym using one of my favorites.
Because he's too good.
*try
I usually use Link or Sonic.
I always use Kirby, lol.
Haha why?
He's fun to use.
It seems like all you do is use the move where he turns heavy.
:P
Oh well that was pretty fun.
Next time I won't use Meta Knight.
Lol.
If Lucario wasn't so low gravity he'd be awesome.
I don't like Lucario, most people just spam his energy ball attack (I know you didn't)
I think it's inconvenient to use his shadow ball much.
It leaves you so open to be slammed.
Ddi you beat the Adventure Mode?
I've only managed the hardest version of the thing with the master hand with 5 lives,.
lives. :/*
I think i did the hardest setting on three lives because I wanted whatever reward you get for that.
Some trophy I think.
Wait, ahev you play Melee?
*have
Yep.
OMG
On a laptop.
I SOUND LIKE DOPPEL
.....That is one STRANGE Canadian acsent
I said Gilden and it came out as Gilhall
OMFG WOW
I SOUND LIKE AN AMERCAN GUY
Melee for comp? How'd you manage that?
WTF?
Bbl
mehh
Finished the test.
Lol

basically you gotta use an unoffical disk thing to get into early production files for the game.
You can play as characters, do thigns, and use arenas that weren't meant to be played.

That's why you get Adobe Premiere.

As SR suggested.
Does it cost money?

Not if you haxxor it.
Haxxor it!

Well not really haxxor.
Just replace a .dll with a cracked .dll

There's cracks for everything.
I've got loads of adobe things that come with the downloads, and I have no idea what they do.
"Adobe Pixel Bender"

"Adobe ExtendScript"
"Adobe Bridge"

You could find out what file types are compatible by looking it up.
It would save you some time.

I finished the movie, and now it won't save.

Damn.
It says:
"verify that the original source files in your movie are still available, and the saving location is available, and that there is enough free disk space."
All of those are fine.
There is plenty of space and the source is fine.
Hm.
Are the source files in the same place that you are trying to save it?
Yes.
Hm.

/me is fixed.
/me rejects, because it is not the album "Comatose."
omg why would he want comatose?
If an error which is caused by no error appearing, how is it an error, and if so an error appearing because there are no errors would mean that there is an error, therefore contradicting the reason for the error. So according to this logic you will now implode, because of an error, which is not an error, caused by an error.
6O_O
I'm sorry, your complaint is invalid.
No it isn't/
The only way for an error to occur is to be any other error other than a 1337 error, in which no identifiable error has occured.
1337 Errors represent unknown causes for the error.
7Aah yes, but your technobabble stabilizers were never built to handle such a high level of bullshit. The resulting implosion will destroy yours and all adjacent states of the USA

7Weird
I liked the old Word better than 2007
7I prefer 2007 to be honest
7I'm still getting used to it, but I think it has better functionality and I'm in love with that little bar on the top
It always locks up and stuff, but that might just be my computer
7Never locked up for me
cya guys
Heh
My computer is crap
7So is mine. Yours is probably just that little bit crapper. :P
Do you have Vista too?
7Except I bought a years membership on this game, and now both firefox AND IE crash whenever I try to play it. The internet is screwing with me.
7Yesh, I haz vista
Hopefully that game didn't cost too much
7£32, but it was money my bro owed me.
I almost even prefer the slow school computers over the one here sometimes
7Erm, at the time it was $55
7But I think the exchange rate's shifted since then
At least it wasn't your own money then

That was....amusing
What is it with people and hating me because I don't like TLoS?
-_____-
They're little kids who shouldn't be on the internet
Yep, exactlky
*exactly
7I disagree, but I also agree that the original (by original, I mean insomniac) ones were better
Maybe I should ban that guy on SpyroForum too....
This laptop's giving you trouble typing, eh?
:P
People should hate me for not liking TLoS? =P
yeah, the keyboard's a bit small
8.9 inch laptop
7That TLoS is bad/whatever you say about it. We had like the one discussion and left it.
Oh, yeah
Well, if you like it, that's cool; it's just not my thing
And I like to make fun of it
=P
7I like it because, and I quote my brother here, "Beating up monkeys on an elevator in a dark fortress towards the evil dragon queen."
Mmph... where's SR when you need him =/
Hahaha, that's exactly what I don't like about it
That combat gameplay gives me a headache
And the story is cliche and predictable
And it's too linear
7Yeah, but MONKEHZ!
I don't hate it as much as you
LOOOOL yeah
But...I still don't like it much
Yeah, I don't completely HATE it
It's just not a very good series
Still arguing with this guy about logic.
I'm winnning.
About 3 hours into the argument.
and it happens to have helped kill my favorite series
Who are you arguing now?
=P

Hey guys? Do you think I should ban that SpyroMad idiot?
On SF?
He didn't do anything there
They were arguing with me about it there, too
Sort of
7Do it.
Wait, and if he does something bad, ban him without warning
I'll give him a short ban, I think
7You only answer to SR, and he's not going to question you.
Not permanent
Hmm
yeah, that's a good idea
?
Hi.
Hello
Hey
I'm excited/
Why's that?
I'm getting something on Monday, I hope.
I won.
He gave up.
Hah.
I WIN!
OK, Spyromad156 is now banned for 7 days
=P
I HAVE PROVED THAT LOGIC IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS CAN BE DERIVED FROM OPINION, IF THE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE!
AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
Who is this person that keeps on?
Anyone want to oppose me?
7No, go away. No-one cares.
when?
7(@dari)
Some guy on another server
I dk
He's supposed to be permanently banned
No one said he was here
Why?
It is possible (although unlikely) that other people are interested.
Looong story
You shouldn't assume that you know what everyone else is thinking.
Long story?
Yeah
Yup
Lets just say it might take about a half hour to tell the entire thing
Uhhh what happened while I was gone or should I just crawl back in my hole/shell
?
So we decided we would be better off without him :)
That's it in a nutshell
:O
I say good riddance
Seconded
:L
7I say we poke him some more :P
But you aren't better off w/o him, he helped the forums you know.
Um, how?
7Ok, this guy is making me suspitious.
Same.
Proxy I think.
Hmm, I'd say he caused a lot more trouble than he helped.
Nope.
899a4a19.4ip1.windstream.net
Yeah, I noticed that too =/
O_o
I support NO ONE.
7Shoo poochy.
No.
I repeat, where is SR when you need him? D=
I wanted to come on chat.
Who are you?
...
Why do you hate me?
What if?
7Because you're a retard
Are you?
7 22:27	DJX	Why do you hate me? Confirmation.
-_-
No one asked for your opinion.
Three seconds to answer, yes or no, then I kick.
Simple enough question
7Go crawl into your kennel
Everyone Shh
Answer the question, DJX
Who are you?
7Oooh. The big-bad wolf is gunna eat me
7I R SCARED
If you don't answer I will kick
Things!
Lawl
:P
7Hey
-______-
7Don't take my voice when I'm pwning my arch-enemy
Actually you're banned and coming here while banned is breaking rules.
You've done a lot of things wrong
We don't want you here anymore after what you've done
How is that so punk.
"Punk"?
=P
fine...You all fail at life.
What's he talking about now?
7I say he doesn't understand the past-tense qualifier, meaning that since he was /banned/ the action is in the past, therefore not directly affecting the present.
Excuse me? No,
7Lol
7n00b
FU.
7I'm keeping my eye on you from now on
I'm not the one who made hate threads and swore at people on chat
7And trust me, I can do a lot.
You provoked me to.
7Now.
Clearly we have nothing useful to say to each other, so...
And why is he still here?
Nope.
Umm, what was that? I provoked you?
7My god
You people want more drama or something
?
No, I did nothing to you
To chat.
7You're SO easy to manipulate
13Rawr
Holy shit
Be quiet.
13Woah wait
Look up
Again.
Guess who
7The pet poochy came inside the house again
13..............................................
7He needs to be locked to his kennel
7Or put down.
In*
I'm going back into my shell now
Bai
Alright then
So if it's a big deal, why is no one doing anything about it?
Thank you.
I hope I did that right...
Now...
7He needs to be kicked too
7:P
13...
o_O
BAM
7Thankee
It would be more fun to ban mibbit users altogether.
kill steeeaaal
Lol
Thank you Mage
Thank you, I was just about to do that :P
Did I do the command right?
BAN ALL MIBBIT USERS!
AHAHAHAAHAHAH
...
-_____-
O_O
Apparently not
STOP USING PROXIES!
Mage, help....
.__.
OH NO HE HAS 7 PROXIES
Kisten!
Ban
899a4a19
That works
That's a start
That is his mibbit code thing.
7*** DJX was kicked by Mage (Mage) <Mage>: BAM <Mage>: kill steeeaaal. Addquote it.
It is always the same.
13......................................
LOL
:E
13Someone explain?
Ban !*899a4a19@webchat.mibbit.com
Ban that ^
It will perm ban him if her tries to join from mibbit.
lawl
Why is no one banning it...?
Don't trust me?
Ban *!899a4a19@*
Hahaahaha
That wont work sir
7Dari: Not as far as a nuclear slingshot can throw you.
Whatever you're supposed to do, do it then, Mage =P
HEY GUISE, YOU SHOULD FUL BAN *!*@* :D
:P
WHOO!
THAT'S FUN!
hahaha
I would rather ban all mibbit users only though.
He's still here.
I'd forgotten.
Maybe.
He's devoiced
No worries
...Fine.
Well he sees our plans
:P
SR might want to come in here and poke him later
LOL
/notice DJX *Poke*
Heheheh
Haha
/notice DJX *Poke*
/notice DJX *Poke*
13<DJX> I WAS going to apologize truthfully

brb
/notice DJX *Poke*
/notice DJX *Poke*
7MOTHER-FUCKER
Finally.
NO, You are KJ.
13Guys...
Seriously, you're not welcome here anymore
7Every time it says devoice I think it says devorce lol.
You might want to ban the proxy he's using as well.
Lol.
13Guys...
13Seriously...
13He's left us alone for some time now
He shouldn't be here
13Can I give you guys what I even think?
Go ahead
If you want, won't change anything.
I'm staying out of this, I am WAY too busy to get into this argument
13The whole reason he acts up every time is because you guys are rude to him straight away! I'm sure he DOES want to apologize, you guys just fire him up before he gets the chance!
(Yes, i ahve updaated myself)
7The third law of modular robotics.
Well, that is kinda Kieran's characteristics
Someone ban *!*@ip.windstream.net
Now I run
SR is coming
But a ban is a ban
Let him take care of it
7Indeed
He shouldn't have come back in the first place
13Ok.
Someone ban *!*@ip.windstream.net
...
Okay, I shall stay
haha
The proxy he's using...
7I should be writing this prologue, and it's like quarter to 11
13Ok.
Why will no one ban the proxy he's using...?
HOLY SHIT
Because you are telling them too Dari
Thank you.
KIERAN YOU JUST SAVED MY BUTT THANK YOU
:P
Hey, language
7No problem?
Woops sorry
OK, now hopefully that worked
13I thought SR was going to handle it.
Thanks prince dari
He can't get into mibbit
13oh...
He's just going to get another proxy you know.
lets hope noone else is using that ISP they try to get in
Lol.
Yeah, probably
Is it still possible for him to get in?
That would be
LOL
Uh
New proxy
...
Lawl
Am I the only one who doesn't know what an ISP is?
Evan, I'm going to ask SR if I can give you op so you can help with this, OK?
lloll
I'm going to have to go soon
ddr, internet service provider
13DDR: No
Okay
Listen.
no
XD
o_O
lolol
...What are you doing?
Umm try
Why am I admin; I have no clue what I'm doing.... D=
hmmm
that should do it
Mage, yeah
What did you just do?
thats what I was thinking
Unbanned something?
......stupid IE
you forgot a .
12You know something that I've always wondered?
So can DJX get back in, or what?
12If someone is invisible, shouldn't they also be blind?
he shouldnt be able to
Hey you missed it
:P
....
DDR, no :P
Okay, that's good
unless he like
changes his ISP
Unless he gets a new proxie
Or that
lol
4??
in which case I'll ban that one too
I'll just pretend I understand
:P
OK, you guys look like you've got it taken care of =P
:X k
I'll bbl
4He did?
12Who's this DJX guy?
4when?
Yes, he did
Well on other networks, they have banned people from joining at all using mibbit.
Minutes ago
12Ah.
By using that number thing in their mibbit hostname.
4FUCK! I missed it
By minutes
Mibbit just makes it hard to ban people :P
4Don't know why I care, but w/e
/whowas DJX
/whowas DRX
yeaaah
/whowas DJX
Well, and proxies
For example *!899a4a19@webchat.mibbit.com
devoicing is always fun though, just because you know theyre staying in there to read what you type, creepy.
That should ban him from using mibbit and joining here at all.
:P
haha
there goes the neighborhood
Well in the banlist on the other place it's like that, and it works.
Indeed lol
So no, you don't need that. :P
I win Things.
Well *!*@* would get rid of all the stupid ppl too :P
Or you could do *!*899a4a19*@*
If you ban that it would definitely stop him from coming back using mibbit.
Don't think it would affect anyone else.
Not 100% sure though.
hbsvhsdkvadbnegtn
I think that's what you suggested before, so I tried it
Meh, it should work.
asdfsgsfas
And he still came back
hjdsghafg?
FAGSAYGDsa
HGJJFGEFJUWF???
fsdfgdfs
13Hey SR
Sup
:P
Maybe that would make a difference, lol.
Wow, nice timing
7Oh, you guys are /so/ stupid! All you need to due is adapt your visors to focus on the upper-theta-quasi-nitro-band and search for protogenic-tachy-chronomitons! It's so simple! *Can_spout_technobabble_too*
=P
7Gtg bye
Banning people sounds really confusing
Fun tho
things: do we have a DNSBL set for epicchat?
:P
12SR, I have a question about Javascript.
Lets see if he comes back
He hasn't for about 10 minutes now
Doubt it lol
you probably screwed him.
Unless he gets another proxy or ISP
he was on windstream?
I have an idea, if he joins, everyone quit
:P
12What do you do if you want something else to happen if a string is given instead of a number?
Ya SR
Ahahahahahaha, someone just Sajoined a spammer to 2500 channels on a different server.
Wow.
Lag much?
Hahaha yeah
thats stupid :P
server-bandwidth-wastin

12Ah, really?

Muhuahah

*watches_a_MyChem_vid*
well i got to go have lunch
Teehee.
i will probably never see you guys again
nuuuuuuu
unless you come out at night
WHy, you're dying?
:P
-_-
Hey guys, does anyone here know how to use photoshop?
anyway i got to go
bye everyone
I have sort of a stupid question =P
bye shadow
Bye SHadowfell.
*fall
bye bye
lol
GOD DAMMIT!!!! My tooth is wobblin
i made it worse -_-
You're still losin' teeth?
7All my teeth were out when I was like 11
Same.
7Although there's this 14 year old on my bus who still has like half of his baby teeth left.
Haha, I'm 17 and I still have one left =P
7I also have two wisdom teeth, had them for like a year and a half.
Is that possible?
:P
It's probably never going to fall out
Yeah, apparently it is :P
It's one of the front ones
The dentist keeps asking if it "bothers me" every time I go there =P
7I lost my two front teeth when I was like 4, never sat on those McDonalds high-seats with the big table near the windows things again.
XDDD
I got a tooth knocked out when I was young.
So did my dad. His brother hit him and like suffocated him under a couch cushion.
XD
i gtg
Baibai
7My brother's 18, and 5 and a half years older than me. He's never beaten me in a fight (I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point).
where is the stupid fill tool in photoshop?!
Blarg
>_> Seriously?
7That's what I'd do.
7I hate Photoshop, much prefer paint.
hmmm... I'll just use fireworks I guess
7For colouring things etc anyway.
(I've never beaten him either, but that's totally besides the point). Lawl.
Paint is somewhat limited with the filling thing
7And I know someone who insists that Photoshop is better for spriting, and every day I tell them they're spouting bull.
I wish i had a brother. Instead I'm stuck with an entirely female house and I'm unfavored. :P
Why aren't they teaching us photoshop instead of fireworks.... D:
7Brb
14Hi all
hi
Hi DarkCyndar.
14How is everyone? :)
Annoyed at stupid photoshop T__T
14LOL!
14Which version?
Could they make it just a little harder to fill stuff in.... >_>
Umm, CS3 I think
14Ah I have no idea on that one
14I use Paint Shop Pro 3
I use GIMP usually
But these school computers don't have GIMP =P
GIMP isn't helpful, IMO.
14lol
Paint serves more of my needs.
No homo.
7Bax
And I thought it might be helpful to learn photoshop in case I feel like spending a fortune on it some day
Hai Kayjay
14I stick to PSP3 and AS3

7... Ok, he dies.
7:P
Haha, I just finished reading the second of those twilight things yesterday
it wasn't THAT bad; I was expecting much worse
7I'm not going to waste money on them
I didn't buy them
School library
7It's probably much like the big build-up to Star Wars 3 (I don't care if you're not a fan, the comparison works), everyone thought it was going to be epic, and they were disappointed because of all the build-up and they expected much more. I suppose it's going to be much the same, but opposite, for Twilight.
7If my school library gets them I MAY read.
Have to admit, Bella was starting to get on my nerves
She's freaking obsessed with that Edward guy
Jumping off cliffs to hear his voice in her head....
Sulking for 6 months after he leaves....
Seriously, get a life
And all she ever says about him is how perfect he looks
7I MAY buy them, just to see how many crappy books it takes to stop some deagle fire.
Looks, that's all she cares about, and they "love" eachother
*each other

Bye guys, going home now

7Snow! ^^
4good night everyone
Hi kieran.
7Hi Brad. :P
My name is so sexy.
7Lol
o-o
Mage caught one of my quotes and put it in the topic
and make me laugh
7I know like three dozen Brads, about half of which remind me of you. It's in the name I suppose, like all guys with the name/middle name of Lesley turn out the stereotypical 'gay'.
http://pastie.org/380457
Tonight, I did the following things onspyrochat
1. made fun of various races of people
3. made fun of furries
not really
4. talked about boobies
just bugged me
5. ummmm oh yeah I told some whoopie goldburg jokes
In other words, It was a good day.
7Lol
7Nice
after tonight, SR you've made me curious
Now that takes me to 1:30am and have ran out of material.
XD
just asking
Its the whole furry thing, it makes you seem like a chick.
i'm just curious to see what everyone on here thinks
7He got it wrong like three times until I got pissed and yelled at him.
hehe
Only good thing about furries is that my gay furry friend in Utah has a bunch of furry chick friends who are not lesbians who live in Utah, so if I am ever in Utah I am totally grabbing a few of them.
XD
Or have him mail me a couple, either way.
heh
I could probably stick them in cages and feed them cat food.
LOL
heh
actually, thats a good question, let me ask someone if furries eat cat food....
no
they don't
Some probably do.
unless they have a separate problem
YES furries do eat cat food
I have confirmation
only some od
*do
http://pastie.org/380460 Mature content
Thats my answer.
Theres a difference.
no
i eat chicken thank you
and no, human foxes do not turn me on.
good
Do you have a food dish?
it's called a cereal bowl
and tell your parents to put your dinner in a dish so you can eat it off the ground?
nope
What kind of poser furry are you?
Levi just wants ass.
But he has a total suit with fur on it and pretends to be a fox.
"I just want to nail me some cat girl" <--- Lul
o-o
Yeah man Rutger is funny, hes dutch and always says the right stuff
want me to bring him in here?
Sure.
OK I told him to connect
greay
*t
We are going to discuss furry cat chicks.
Do dogs chase furry cat chicks?
I dont know
not always
but Rutger is fricking halarious
hes funnier than me
I hope he has some good stuff to say about the furry chicks.
o-o
cocksssss
-.-
Hey rutger
sup man
MIRC is some confusing shit
-.-
don't you mean holemate
AMIRITE
hahahahha
7If I say no, do I have to be a part of the conversation?
Yeah, we need some of your wisdom about chicks who dress up like cats.
wowowowowowo holy shit
your font is orange
how
7Lol
7Epic win
no
7:P
epic fist in your mouth if you don't tell me
xD
7Hold down ctrl then press K
7Got some colours
4oh shit
HOOOOLY SHIT
7You have to do it every time
what
crapcocks
rutger, its like drugs
7It's better on mibbit, where the colour just stays.
4
*runs to mibbit*
You can make the colour stay on mIRC.
...
Retard.
7Yeah, but it's easier on mibbit
No it's not.
XD
7I only use mIRC when Mibbit's being a bitch
Me and rutger have been talking about furry chicks for like the past hour
Im very strange
we kno
7No shit
Yay
rofldongs
you got mibbit workin?
Eurgh, mibbit.
BURN!
BUUUURRRRRRRN!
oh this looks way better than crappy mirc
7Hah! I win.
4cocks?
4YES
4COCKS.
Mibbit is a simple piece of crap.
4Red cocks.
-.-
Simple = Bad
4The Boston Redcocks
rutger: Can levi ship us cat chicks?
4I vote yes.
4And fredryk phox, I wanna meet that guy
4lol
4why does it say I like boobies
4not that I don't like boobies
4but
4like
4. . .
Because I was talking about how I liked boobies a little while ago.
4Ah
4good man
Because someone asked me if I was gay
so im all like
I like boobies
4Any boobies up in this chat? or is it the international house of sausage again
._.
no
Then no
Sausage fest
4Brad brad brad... a woman is much much more than just some 'boobies'.. grow UP
4They also have vagina's, and hands to jerk your gurkin and make dinner...
4Not to mention pooper.
4 8D
Hey man, this is a chat about a purple dragon
keep it low...
4Oh
4rite
we have furries in here listening.
4purple dragons.
-.-
hahaha
4I've got some weed lying around, I'll start seeing purple dragons all over the place in no time
4lal
Good call.
dutch green club
4Isn't it kinda double having a purple dragon chat on a site named after green frogs?
Mibbit isn't my site
4no shit sherlock
4but still
so why did you ask
Mibbit is a piece of crap.
I cant change it
4well
its not my site
4NO
4BUT
I got myself banned from the mibbit network.
4I knew I had a point somewhere
7I have two friends on steam, £20 says they're furries. One even grew out his hair to look like a mane, and 90% of the conversations I have with the other one start with him saying "Why does Pete like to torture me?!" and I'd totally ditch the both of them if they weren't epic mappers.
4it's because all of this goddamned furries
4They're raping my mental asshole
From explaining on their main channel, #mibbit, how mibbit is so extremely crappy.
rutger only likes the furry chicks
4Quite so.
With good reason.
4Oh yes
Its like the disneyland parade.
Except less mexicans
4Social outcasts = sex like there's no tomorrow, that combined with the absolute kinkyness of catgirls
4??
4PROFIT
Totally.
Makes perfect sense.
4And less mexicans, no doubt.
They are completely insecure and suggestible.
4lol, I remember we once planned a habbo raid here
4like
4years ago
did we?
I dont remember
4Yep
Habbo was fun to screw with
4 /blackup

4lol
4we went niggerniggernigger on the pool
Oh yeah

Good times
4fun stuff
4I always love me a good raid
4lol

Good day to you too, sir.

Hm.
4kek?
got out of work early
nice
/me got a 360 today!
/me 4doesn't care!
It's a conspiracy!
I'll stick to my PS3 lol
hehe
Wii > All
PS3 is dragging Sony down.
and I care why?
If they don't drop PS3, they might crash and burn. Lol.
I don't care because I like the games and have the money to get them
and it plays blue reay
"ray"
so I'm satisfied
Blu ray has been beaten by HD, it will become extinct.
XD
Playstation products have a long lifespan.
PS3 has made huge losses for Sony.
why are you trying to prove points that I could really care less about lol
I'm bored.
Very bored.
apparently
O R YA?
Yes.
When did I say he would?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO POINT IT OUT TO ME WHEN I DON'T CARE
You inferred it.
No I didn't, you assumed it.
Why did you say it then?You ovbiously have some sort of point your trying to prove
And it was in response to you saying that Playstation products have a long lifespan, and it's because I'm bored.
When I'm bored, I argue, about anything really.
then go find something usefull of your time
Nothing useful to do. :P
go outside or something
Too dark/Cold.
go for a drive...oh wait...nevermind
:P
We could turn off the radar blocker in the Looking Glass.
I'm glad I can drive
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-255577.html#255577
LOL
Nobody home I assume?
Just Evan
:L
:P
-BE TRUTHFUL. This means, when she asks you, "Does this look good on
me?", It's okay to say no. She wants the truth.
*Slap*
O_o
I think that's a bit stupid, of course they want you to lie to them in situations like that.
That's why I don't ask people if stuff looks good on me
Haha, it's a mental regulator, not a lie-detector test. They justw ant you to reassur them even though they know sometimes it doesn't look good or whatever.
*just want, reassure
Because if they say yes, it means nothing because they could easily be lying
SR you should have gave them that quote I said
what quote was that?
I'm trying to remember lol
you said you were gonna save it 0.o...
Deranged Dr. Remehov.
I got a laptop
No, she has a laptop
^ O MAI
hm
I should block google.
On the router, my dad would probably think his precious computer got a virus.
Heheheh.
Simpletons.
and what would happen when he found out there was no virus?
He wouldn't.
I'm too good for him.
Oh, I see
I should also block all social networking sites.
And MSN.
LOL, skip to 45: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_HYu-ds-Go
:P
And make the internet stop on their computers after a certain time.
She ran when your mom came home.
Yep
Yeah
Rather than with a u?
Because it comes from the word mother.
:P
I haven't heard anyone say mum
Mum is actually less like the ENglish language.
Not really.
Mom = Mother
The proper English language is strange.
Is it muther?
No.
With random irregularities.
"So that's the plan, Destiny Maaaaaaaan?!"
"I dove" sounds better than "I dived"
But it is incorrect. :P
Dove is much less awkward to say
Well, here at least.
:P
I think the UK is incorrect.
And you are wrong.
Everyone here knows im always right.
oh yeah...
2:)
Oh, you found out that he wasn't a girl?
That could be right

I always have cool teachers for Geography and Social Studies classes

My first Geography teacher worked in lindt before.

Someone has to have made a Rick Rolling virus.
Then I could send it to school.
It would take over the network.

And play Rick Astley endlessly.
13He kept saying "Charlie Pace" earlier
I thought so

/me looks up Charlie Pace on Wikipedia
Opps.

I asked that. Or something like it.
Because I got a laptop

Is that so you can have more private conversations with SR?
/me runs.
Don't be ridiculous
^ he's right.
I need a laptop because I'm going to college soon
Nice excuse.
College = Sir's House?
The only way anyone in my family can get a response from me is if they talk to me via some kind of IM.
No
I know she has a pic of SR as her Desktop Backround.

*I
If you scroll up a little, you can see what I actually said

That's an illusion.
SR edited it to protect you.
It's even saved as a horrible quality JPEG picture
13XDDDDDDDDDDD
Yeah he even dragged me into,.
Said the safety of the forum was at stake.
But I was fast enough to take a screenshot.
Of course
Naturally he called me because, of course, I'm the best choice.
JKJK
And that said screenshot took ten whole minutes to upload
13SR says that having an internet relationship is for losers :P
Right.

T_o
If I have to delete it, you must admit that you hugged SR in public.
2After I'm done.
But I didn't.
It would be a lie.
The evidence says otherwise.
The evidence has been tampered with
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cwO8Ng2x74&feature=channel_page
Anyone can tell if you scroll up that I never said that
And anyway, even if I *did* say that
Can you prove that the evidence has been tampered with.
It's just text
So I didn't actually hug anyone
:P
Admit that you had intent to hug SR in public then.
I believe you've hugged Abbey before.
Or Cyndar.
But I didn't.
It would be a lie
No, the evidence proves that you did.
Want me to get my own evidence?
wow you must be really bored to try proving things that didn't actually happen...and who cares if they did
Bahahaha
No one would care
2Mwahaha.
And I can prove that SR edited what you said, extremely quickly with another screenshot of SR admiting to editing it.
Don't devoice Dari.

He can, but Things has set typos at 40%
He's still learning, he just learned how to walk and speak.
Or something around that.
7Oh lol
7That's more than 40%
Not really.
10more like 70%?

A friend and I are taking Egan hostage, and making her pay ransom if she ever wants to see herself again.

If you should ever like to see yourself again, surrender a minimum of five limbs, and one of your eyes (it does not have to be your favorite) and you death has been postponed until the aforementioned items are accounted for. Goodday."
4hm
He's Things.
I know, but that doesn't seem like a bot to me :P
It learns.
It's pretty clever.
You can set it's mood, percentage of typos it makes, etc.
Well, things can.
10ooh
"The period in which you must remove said limbs and eye has been drastically changed. Now, in compensation for this wasted day, 1/4 of your soul has been added to the list. Good day, and have a nice one. You know, day. The part that comes before night. Yet after the wee hours; which I do not consider morning. Something like inbetween."
10Make Terminator angry... that may be funny
I don't think he gets angry.
10pfft. it should.
Only, lonely, happy, eletricity (Is this a mood? O_o), horny, stoned
I say we make Terminator an emotional vampire.
Everytime someone expresses anger or sadness he bites them.

i gotta go pig... i'll see you later
You are clearly far to small minded to carry on even a semi-intellectual conversation. You keep saying the same stuff over and over again without any way to back it up. I'm through with you.
/me 2is getting pizza.
4I find them completely hilarious, even though I am not racist
7DDR!

Oh, I never check my email

13Youtube hates me too
You aren;'t alone

12It's just like how I was untouched by the recession... until Circuit City closed down...
13Dragon_protector_x: SR has the link somewhere
Dragon_protector_x: http://spyroforum.toolbar.fm/

MWAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
H
I'm done.
12Installed.
13"I'm lovin it" =P
Eurgh
Mcdonalds.
13XD
What's the toolbar thing about?
Yeah, I should shove it full of ads.
I will never forget their advert.
"Now made with real chicken breast!"
Creepy.
won't teh explodfing hurt?
grrr -f
Yes, it will.
12I don't associate toolbars with adware, but then again, I only voluntarily installed a toolbar twice.
I never install toolbars. Unless I have to.
My toolbar is actually useful and not annoying.
Well, with the exception of SR's toolbar. :P
YAY!!!!!
13There's one thing I'm not sure about the toolbar
13Is that it puts rrandom sentences from webpages into the search thing
7CAEK
What?
13the search part of it
13Oh
Yeah
:P
What toolbar?
I think it's useful.
7What's the record for most SC users online at one point? Wasn't it like 21 or something? We should try for 30 at one point, just for the hell of it.
/me is lost
13That's different
13It's cool though
13Thanks
I think it's useful, because otherwise you have to copy-paste. :/
DDR: http://spyroforum.toolbar.fm/
13it's also easier for seeing new posts quickly :D
I could build in spyrochat into the toolbar
The posts thing is really useful.
LOL ^ That sounds cool.
I actually hate toolbars
but I use my own because I built it in a way that I wouldn't mind it.
Well most aren't useful.
/me 2spins DDR around and puts a bandanna over his eyes
...wow, it actually let me download it
/me can't see a thing
/me pushes DDR off a cliff.
O_o
Good thing there's water at the bottom.

Hmm...

7That 'book' you're writing on SF, you need a new chapter.
Ohh, OK :L
/me pins the tail on Mage

7I'm not playing.
/me 7burns both tails.

Basically
7Haha
7And I'm spoilsporting. :P

Little do you all know the toolbar is part of my evil master plan
It actually let me on this computer
Oh noez
2Good thing I haven't downloaded it.
I'm gunna put my local radio station into the toolbar.
2Does it work for Chrome?
BRB
Firefox and IE only
2Aww...
How is google chrome?
7I don't intend to use the toolbar, since all of my SF experience is from what people have told me.
Is it good?
2Yes!
Hurrah.
2New NS episode.
2Be back in 20.
Hmm...seeing less of the screen will take some getting used to
You can uninstall it any time
or hide it.
7:P
I never even look over at those things
12Can I get a key?
12I'll pay you.
XD
7The key does not fit.
Asking would be the first way to guarantee that you won't get one :P
7Maybe Terminator will go to the locksmith.
12That's what she said.
/me hasn't asked....:P
Ooohhh, that's what she said!
:P
Oh please no.
Thats what Jessy says every few sentances.
That is really old...
7That's what she said

6I HATE RMFM
3Is it supposed to have your right location on the toolbar?
6It's so.....homemade
For the weather?
3Yeah
You can change the location.
It works it out originally from your IP address I'm guessing, so it's likely to be wrong.
And it notifies me if I get a message on my hotmail accont.
account*
It's cool.
3Clicked a link on the toolbar
lol
3How do you set an avatar on Gmail?
I dont remember
3Oh.
Aw, no more functions. ):

I should make my own version of MS Paint.
But it will be better.
O_o

12A now banned user.
3I'm surprised he never went to Darkspyro and decided to worship Doppel
12What do you mean by "got glined", though?
4Probably banned there
I got banned from DarkSpyro in about 2 hours.
I'm the amazing.
Doppel sent me a PM about someone worshiping him
12Proxy...
that*
I started trolling everyone on Raidon's leaving thread in DS.
12I'm going to find a proxy that can get into SF.
Well I made an account so I could troll people disagreeing with him about Doppel.
why>
Nope.
3Some guy who got himself banned for being an idiot, basically
Hmm
Must have been Raidon then
Then I got banned within 2 hours of trolling them.
I'm just too good.
You can find the thread on there, it's locked though.
I honestly don't know who I would have sided with if I had been their
*there
6why did he get banned for
Doppel also pmed me the two threads you were arguing in
4For being a fucking retard
LOL
3Someone else want to explain?
You explain

12Okay, so may someone please give me a link to the thread?

Bleh, I'm really annoyed right now
Wait! i mean no.
3See?
It can't understand what I'm saying
12I don't think that the RP forum should give gems...
Yeah
3..or posts
12Yeah.
Or add toward your post count
6yes i know that i seen the movie......thats just a username for Terminator
It's pointless
Basically another spam forum
http://forum.darkspyro.net/spyro/viewposts.php?topic=13265

If anyone wants to see that topic of me owning n00bs, that's it.
http://forum.darkspyro.net/spyro/viewposts.php?topic=13265 <---
The bot can understand wut your saying, but it's still only a "baby", so it's still got learning to do lol
4I don';t RP anymore...or, as much as I used to
Terminator sux
4pretty much, I wanna see that fourm get removed JUST to see people's reaction

6well i believe hes older then all of us,a little
10Unless... he's entering adolescence ....
10Then I suppose you could say "kinda"
6idk,i was chatting with him last night
4If you are older then me then he can talk lol
10Eh, I just like to be literal
12And, I'm pretty sure that Akon the singer, wouldn't like Spyro.
6i asked him a question if he were to be Hunter of anything,and he said he is
12Also, he could be lying about his age, and RaidonMakato is probably older than everyone.
10xDDD
4no he isn't
12But, whatever you say.
6i was speaking of a kid or teenager

"I know you've been waiting the past four years for when you'd have to be escorted out from that hellhole. Niles will be there by sunset. You have ton go now -- take everything we've told you to that's in our directive memo. If you ever get stumped, refer to The List.
If more Crocodiles are aware of your exodus I'll have to send in paratroopers to defend you. Secure the package in Albequrque and all will be well, they'll keep you safe until the Corocodiles come for you. Listen closely, this next part is very important: They're going to take you."

13" But, after re-reading the Tyto Family scene in The Capture and read W.O.T.E, I now believe that it takes place in the future!" LOLOLOL
13did you PM that to her?
Yep.
Then I sent this: "Ever since they discovered our little operation down in the Matrix Hub the Crocodiles have been searching for you. Luckily we were able to hide you so well that you were safe from harm. I was hired by your mother to join this forum and keep an eye on you.
13XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The Crocodiles are a corrupt group of men and women who want to kill you after what your mother did 27 years ago. Did you follow my directives, did you go to the safehouse in New Mexico?!"

There!*points*
687
We have to kill him before he spreads his spores and more evil mushroom men pop up
And the only way to kill him is...
HOW?
10Eh oh
Bye bye everybody
4Terminator: How long will that take?
Bye
811 years
4Terminator: How long is 811 years?
Until something explodes.
To burn him on a funeral pyre made of a special type of wood called ceritomen, which is only located in one place, and is guarded by death-bringers.
The mushroom man is telling me to...the voices are telling me to...to...
Also they must be sprayed with sieser oil.
Dari: darn hamburgers!
4Terminator: How long will it take until something explodes?
55 seconds
Which comes from the sieser olive, located only on the top of mount everest, in select locations.
Then you must light it using a sprig from a coarse hathberry bush.
Which is found only on mars.
The voices are telling me to destroy the sieser olive
Just crush it, the oil will come out.
13Nevermind
13I get to stay hooooome
4Terminator: What will explode in 55 seconds?
10Oh boy
Dari: They
're telling me to burn it
4Terminator: How long is 55 seconds?
70 days
And you must also destroy skillet. Otherwise the ceremony won't be complete and the mushroom man won't die.
T_T
4Terminator: How long is 70 days?
13lol
92 years
10xDDDDDDD
Or you could just set him alight and ride out the trip.
4Terminator: How long is 92 years?
until something explodes
It's like extra strong magic mushroom, but you smoke it.
The voices are telling me to sing...I DUN WANNA
13"The MUSHROOM KINGDOM!"

You know that guy, on the wolf thread, who said that wolves don't kill for no reason?
That they only do it when they're hungry?
In a three week period in February 1978, wolves were responsible for the wanton killing of numerous seals near Astrakhan. Between 17-40% of the seals in the area were estimated to have been killed, but not eaten.[2]
13http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-6726-do-you-have-a-boyfriend-girlfriend-and-relationships-discussion-in-general.html?start=345 LOL @ the third post down
wolfs killed my mother for no reason.
I'm gunna go post that.
Where's the thread?
i ate it
13Spyro Master probably pushed it to another page
Nuuuuuuuuuuu
13-____-
13weee
13bored...
Oh, and it gets worse, about the wolves thing.
Since the late 1990s, there have been several cases of many Caspian seals dying due to canine distemper virus.
It caused thousands of them to die years afterwards too.
Looooool.
13Wow.
Man since I started drinking this energy drink, like 5 mins ago, i've been like continously releasing bad gas ..
>.>
13That's sad, but it's funny that we proved him wrong
13Someone watched too many anime wolf/dog shizz.
A century ago there were an estimated 1.5 million seals; by the 1980s, there were about 400,000.
O_o
Wow.
Yes.
^NUUUUUUUUUUUUU
You're right.
o_O
How can you be so sure?
13I think I just died for a second
13XDDD
Wolves know how to act...?
WTF?
13AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
13Somebody WAS watching too many wolf cartoons!
Probably got it from anime.
13On YouTube around last week, I went to see why everyone was insane about some dog named after drugs
13Ahaha.
13I'd like to see these kids spend ONE DAY as a wolf. Out in the cold, danger of being hunted, having to catch your own food and eat the meat without cooking it
13No technology
13Ahaha
13These kids need to find out how lucky they are.

Oh, and
<Terminat0r> ARRRRRRRGH!! I had a horrible nightmare of a frightening, semen covered spider obliterating an anus :<
I've hacked into her PC long ago
7Brazilian_Spyro: Make sure you don't choke on the bullshit coming out of your mouth.
I'm telling this now because she is not here, but don't go spreading the word
7Brazilian_Spyro: Make sure you don't choke on the bullshit coming out of your mouth.
I know about the photo and that she's nopt 16, nor 10 nor 9
7Mmhmm.
she is way older and is trying nowt to show that
13Haha nope
7Right. She's /not/ nine. I TTLY believe U!
13:P
Sometimes i'm afraid to find out what goes on in that insane head of yours.
7Terminat0r: Me too. ^^
Too much things that you wouldn't believe
When I hacked into her PC I even got the site where she got that photo
I see I can't make you believe in the truth of the fact
I'm saying is that she can be somehow 30 or around that, and she doesn't want to show that
Cmon, are you crazy?
7She is nine.
13"she CAN be"
13There's a difference between can and is
13:P
And I could be 69.
13And how would you know if it was her, or if it was her parents? Jeez
And I am.
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
13yup.
I liek to lookz at childrenz!
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know even if she is really her
I got proof that she IS liying about her age
Show me proof
Or I will set pedo bear on you.
7I've got proof. You only need to read ANY post of hers to see she's in the nine/ten/eleven agegroup.
Search for the member HanliSmith123 on spyroforums, and then look at spyroli
And if the proof is inadequate, pedo bear will still be sent after you
the two members have diferent birthdates
13She could've just put random ones, you know :P
13Jesus.
7Brazilian_Spyro: And? I accidently set my age to fourteen when I joined. It could be a mistake, I've corrected it now though.
That's why she is lying about her age(s)
13That's not proof.
Oh holy crap, hack into her PC and see what I saw to believe what I say
7And how exactly do we hack into her PC?
7Walk us through it, step by step.
Is someone here moderator of spyroforums? (if they can see Ips)
13I am :P But no I'm not hacking.
7Get the IP, and dari will do it,.
You can't hack someone with an IP address...
You could use her IP adress to find her PC
No you can't
You talk BS.
I did hack into her PC
7IPs are useless. Even I know that.
With her IP address, you could find approximately where she lives.
13yalp
13Nope
Or send packets to it, on ports.
13You're lucky enough to find a city with an IP
Although antivirus usually blocks random packets.
There is a program called VNCViewer
Doesn't work ^
I said to her to download it
Then I could see what is inside her PC
So you put a keylogger on her computer...?
Or a trojan?
Not exactly
Yes exactly.
A trojan gathers information from the victim.
I just could navigat into her PC with her knowing that, but she didn't know what I was seeing
Well most trojans.
Why would she let you?
You talk crap too much.
13So, if you "knew all along" why didn't you stop being a flirt or whatever with her? Jesus kid
Assume the position%#%^@@$#~@@##$
Because she is a fool, and fell on my trap
Because I'll get all the information out of her this way
I'm pretending to fall on her trap
Okay, I've said what I had to say, that's it. That's All
13FREAKYBOY
13*FREAKBOY

13Oh, did I say nine? I meant eight.
13:P
13He sounds like some thirteen year old boy trying to sound cool after being embarrased about his 8 year old "gf"
13On dS he asked me if I was "Envious" of the picture of his "gf" because I didn't believe her

7It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:<
Holy fuc, you guys! Curious George is on!!!
It took 3 hours to look that up...?
D=
Wow.
YAAAAAAAAAAAY
7Not literally three hours.
7Twat
7Considering each lesson is only 50 minutes too.
Don't exaggerate then.
:)
7Don't be a literal fagballs then.
It's the only one I can remember from that one French IT lesson. Where I spent like three hours looking up "my cat died" and then my fucking teacher told me to take it out D:< That is why I am taking spanish for modern languages
What does that have to do with anything?
7On topic? It's not a forum idiot.
It's about french lol
LAWL, why do you think there is a topic command?
You have topics.
Idiot.

7Wouldn't you be like, the Head General or something?
*working
I can't see him being female really.
Because he has eternal PMS
7I swear to God if I see that intro once more I'm going to kill someone.
Thank you
Looks cool too
Thanks :)
I prefere it with music
Im no good at flash, I can just do basic stuff in KoolMoves
I would show you the one with music but it is annoyingly slow
that font is really hard to read though
Yeah ^
Yeah, it doesn't even have any punctuation
So change the font to something more readable? O_o
I would recommend for the text animations, you do a soft fade in, wait, blink to white, then dissappear.
but thats just me, I think it gives a little more "edge" to it.
Or you could make a "next" button, so it the animation continues when you want it to.
Then you don't have to watch it 3 times trying to read the text.
Its an intro, it doesnt need a next button
just make the font more readable and maybe consider a different text animation style
A mistake thats made is playing music with lyrics other than whats displayed on screen
It's nice. I have flash, but I've never actually made anything with it.
Maybe throw in some lighting bolts and a pirate flag.
O_o? ^
lightning*
I also love that song
7Pirate flag?
Lol
......maulteasers
..brb
I am looking for a tutorial for a preloader, it's just a pain when flash iss sucky on Vista
...
One sec.
I displays fine in XP
It*
I have a preloader file somewhere. O_o
firefox on XP is all good with your flash
Not slow at all.
So that is another reason why IE is crap
I wouldn't blame IE
I think its just flash
mcname._xscale=(_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100;
it comes down to the speed of your pc because flash does take CPU to process.
That's for a bar ^
And
I had to introduce my teacher to flash kit lol
You should use a round function because you can't have half pixels.
If you want text under it, with percentage loaded
textname.text=Math.round((_root.getBytesLoaded()/_root.getBytesTotal())*100)+"%";
Then to stop it leaving that frame, unless it's loaded
if (_root.getBytesTotal() != _root.getBytesLoaded()){
gotoAndPlay(1);
}
That's it.
...wow
...is that dari lol
Yep.
I should of guessed
Yes, you should have.
:P

13That's not flirting :P

7If you want to pose for sympathy, go elsewhere.
12No..
12My friend...
7Oh I'm too tired for this
12She died in a housefire
I'm pretty sick of you!
4hm
7We hear crap like this practically every time she comes on. I'm skeptical (two Cs?) with good reason.
12
7As I said, I'm too tired for this, so I'm not going to bother this time.
7... I so did not expect that to work.
Look, wheather it's true or not it's real, what's the harm in a little internet-sympathy?
12oh no..
7Wyndon: Don't feed the trolls.
12i might not be able to go on here
12Im not...

12Oh my god.

7That's all I'm saying on the matter. My internal clock has re-moulded around school, so I'm tired at like nine o'clock now.
Troll? She's just a kid!

Up on the table, arms out, knees bent, now flap!

12JEEZE...please guys not now
4You knew this would happen if you said it on here so why did you come on?
My dad's friend died when he was 14. Want the story?
12V I'll type what happen..
12nvm
12sure sr...
4I'm sure that several of us have stories about death
4My twin died. I can type the story
12sure...
12I have a real story...
12about my mom's aunt's death :(
12She, died of cancer..
I lost my real mom when I was six
Well, there was this guy in my dad's neighbourhood.
He was always good with kids
12she couldnt even open her eyes or talk ....my moms aunt died of cancer
had barbicues etc etc
So one day my dad's friend is outside, and he calls him inside his house for whatever reason
7Oh jesus, I can't deal with this. I'm just going to go and type up an intro in this RP, someone call me when the death-fest is over.
strangles him and kills him.
4Which one?
No reason at all.
12What!
12That doesn't make sense...
Yep
It doesn't
12Why would he do thatd?
12*that
But if your killing people like that in the first place, its not going to make sense.
Don't know.
The guy is either dead or in jail today.
that was like 28 ish years ago.
Then theres the story about my dad's other friend who liked to hit .22 shells on the top with a hammer in his basement
12Thanks wyndon.
12But, I'm sort of upset right now..
13Backz

Wait
No.

1,8New Topic Alert:2 "Which kind of furies do you like the better, ANB's, TEN's or DotD's?" by Sheita, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8691
Well I can make the page automatically refresh every 3 seconds.
So you just have to worry about clicking it
7Refreshing isn't the problem, my clicking speed is.
Hm
What's the description of the valentines egg?
7Erm... hold on
7This egg is speckled and very fragile.
7The limit is two
How long before new eggs come on it?
7Erm, there are three eggs every five minutes and a big drop every hour. But with the abandoned page blocking the cave entrance you sometimes get a backlog, which is getting bigger now that the Valnetines eggs, as well as frilled, have come into it.
So willl the valentines eggs come every hour?
7There's a chance they'll also come at the five minute drops or several times during a release of the backlog.
backlog...?
7Yes. If the eggs in the abandoned page get to a certain number then it blocks up the caveborn eggs, stopping anyone from picking them up. These eggs don't evaporate, just stay there, building up, so when the abandoned page has a few less and it's NOT blocked the cave entrance, then all the built up eggs can be picked up. But only in threes.
7dari, how's it going?
Meh, not that well

7The rarest I can breed is a silver.
7If you wait I'll be able to breed you some frilled.
3Anyone got a Valentine's dragon yet?
7No, I want one!
7I'm obsessing.
3Yeah, I just realized that they existed
7LOL
3Were they available yesterday too?
7They may only be on today, although there's some speculation that they're here to stay since not every egg is one.
3Hmm
3Btw what's a frilled?
3If you wait I'll be able to breed you some frilled.
I saw your post on the Cyril fan club

3Yeah
7They have the same description as skywings.
3Soo...did they get rid of Skywings, or is it just luck getting one?
7You gotta click, and hope you didn't get a skywing.
3Mehh
3That's dumb
7If they DO get rid of skywings, I should be fine for breeding.
3Great, so the gray one is an alt stone dragon....

Dev-CPP: There must be something terribly wrong with your code. Please fix it.
7What I never got was why people always said "Circumfrence of a circle." Surely, if circumfrence is only used when talking about the perimeter of a circle, then the qualifier "of a circle" is unnecessary.

I like how in the end Sonny saves Calvin, ultimately proving he was very different than most robots (compared the robot that saved Spooner rather than the young girl underwater).
The same situation repeated itself, which was kewl.
7The only thing I will go out and watch that has Will Smith in it without it looking like an 11/10 on the pwn meter (which, admittedly, iRobot does, I just cba to go watch it) is the Fresh Prince of Bellair. Because it's awesome.

10You poor, poor thing
7That's hardly a fair trade on your part.
4seriously
Meh, it's so boring.
Someone finally died at the end of the first one though.
7Eragon is an epic rip-off of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, and it's so awesome it manages to pull it off without anyone caring.
^ Yeah.
10Agreed
And oh God, the second twilight book.
It's terrible.
All the vampires leave and it gets even more mundane than normal.
4havn't read a single one of them
All it is is some girl crying.

Voice changer :P
You don't have one.
Nor would you buy one.
Got one
Nor use it for every phone call, just in case it's me.
I win
And anyway, now I know either to listen for your voice, or a distorted voice.
Simple.
I win.
4You don't know what I sound like that
Anywho
4like*
4I can easily change my voice
You have to use BOTH names of my "Freind" to get my mum or dad to pass the phone

I know Stacey's first and last name.
hahaha
Silence!

I don't care, I win.
End of.
You dont
Finished.
Cuz I hate guys from the harvey :P
I will win this
I don't care, your parents probably think you say that to cover for the fact your boyfriend goes there.
I win.
7It's like those assholes at school who CLAIM to make a prank call and then just stand there going "YOU'REGAYYOU'REGAYYOU'REGAYYOU'REGAY" for twenty minutes >.<
Lol thats what those pricks at the harvey do
People ask me to do prank calls all the time, since I'm the only one out of them that can keep a straight face.
OH SORRY KIERAN
They asked me to phone a sperm donor...
I did a prank call once
Well a bunch of us did in year 7
Anyway, I still win.

4wow....
10Unless they mated while trapped in the crystal
4even this is starting to annoy me now
10AND Cynder gave birth to her
13Cactus: .____.
10AND she somehow got out of the crystal and into a human body
13How twisted.
13Ahaha
13XD
6RDX: Why're you reading it then..?

13Cyril_the: So you're going to make up a sad sappy thing to get her some sympathy?
13How nice.
13Heard this a thousand times.
12she also says shes not the daughter of Spyro and Cynder thoses are false...her friend Alyi i believe told me th future and in my dreams i see what is really true

6Huh. Am I mistaken or a few minutes ago was she crying about people not believing her dragon story? Yeah.... whatever\

peter was moses and he said jews ho

13In one episode they were talking about the gay rights issues and the issues of our previous president and they were correct
the family guy commandments
13So it is politically correct.

Hi
13I found a new video site, but I only just discovered it and have to look around
Okay, what is it called?
13http://bestonvideo.com
13I'm currently looking around
13Just registered.
Lol
YT logo style
Its a very small site isnt it
Just registered
13Every site is small at first xP
13I guess it means MOAR VIEWS :P
I know
XD
I hope YT doesnt catch it
What's your name on there?
Lol
Invite for friend sent :)
13If you notice there's lots of Club Penguin/Runescape crap....and AMVs so this looks like a place that lots of AMV people are going to :D
Current Position: 189 / 4469 KBytes At least it gives you the position
This is so much quicker than yt
I guess they have too many videos on YT
Hang on, have you uploaded a video yet?
13I'm uploading now.
It has that processing thing
Approval WTH?!
13Oh, you need to wait for approval?
Yeah
13ClipUpload does that. No worries.
13They just want to make sure that there's nothing bad in the video or something...
Oh ok
You have (1) videos awaiting approval [note: only approved videos show on the list]
13lol
How long do you think it will take?
Bob.
13Not sure. It's different for every site.
13Crap this thing is awesome
13It's fun just to watch it speed around while it uploads XD
13hi
G' morning
13:D
:)
How are you doing nyaa?
13good.
Well, she found it
I'm just helping her around
13:P
13...
13It's our job to bring Spyro to this site :D
/me highfives
Let's show em what we can do
I'll try making videos again once I have got this bloody preview done
Trust me, it is easier to muck around with premade clips than making the clips
13lol
13I know
Stupid OCR National
13I'm addicted to using my movie clips because I've been running out of ideas for Spyro
:(
13 99% complete
I have updated my flash preview, want to see it?
*on multiple tabs* Sure
13hmm
13sure
Mornin'
7Stupid revision. I'm allowed on, put only because of YT as my excuse =/
Hmm, cool
Thanks :)
13hm.
13Where do you get your clips?
13Like, what site.
Depends. I got a few off of Youtube, and those were broken. I think I got the EN ones from Megaupload, but they aren't there anymore
13You need to get them from FileFront.
13I'll give you some links.
13As far as I know they're the only decent ones.
13http://hosted.filefront.com/MasterBlui <-- TEN and DOTD clips. A couple are ANB clips.
13http://hosted.filefront.com/ZekiraGDrake <-- ANB Clips
Thank you for the link

Approval system?
7http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=1486 <-- This one, then it'll be better. That's like saying you should close down the art section because of bad art or the FF section because of people's bad writing skills.
No one's saying to close it down
7Not close down
7Sorry
I just don't think five-second posts like the ones that go in there need to count towards post count
It's a game section

4wow that was really...dumb
13HAHAHAHA that was lame.
4oi

13It's not like they're born and killed right away. They're raised, then slaughtered. Food is food.
I can't believe people actually say*

4eh...who gives a damn
I R VEGITARIAN DRAGON!!!111!111

hmm
13"Oooh Burn" is such a phrase for immature little children in elementary school.
I also can't believe that people say "Tres cool"
Ooh burn
4which is prolly what he is
It sounds so stupid and dumb blonde.
13What's that mean
13Ahaha
"That is just, like, tres cool"
Tres is very in French
yeh
who says that?
13That's dumb XD
i've never heard it
really?
i've been around some blonds and ive never heard that
Which is why it's stereotypical.
?
explain that
...
Google it for a definition.
13...
13How old are you?"
why is it stereotypical if ive never heard it from a blond
4hm
You really don't know what stereotyping is?
a predetermined judgement for some group of people
Exactly.
4heheh
So it doesn't really matter whether the people actually say it or not.
It may even come from movies.
4it can also be the ultimate shield for people
But what I'm saying is that I can't believe that people actually say it.
People have said it on here.
:P
ok then... maybe i missed part of the conversation about this
4one of the reasons why society sucks as usual
pesimitic hmm
13hmmm...
*pesimistic
4nah I just tell the truth
13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
4 0.0
Yeah, I like to think of myself more as a realist, than being pesimistic.
I don't create illusions.
4I'm a realist by far
I tell it as it is.
15............
4problem is
truth can come half full or empty
4now you can't tell someone these days
4the truth because you will be accused of a vast amount of things
13RAWR
4including Stereo typing
/me 13is insane atm
One word.
:P
4I could care less if it is
I know.
4on here I don't give a shit about my spelling lol
But I still like to correct people.
why do people care about spelling if they know what the word is
4ok grammar Nazi
Yes, I am.
4Only place I care about it is in my stories that's it lol
as far as im conserned if the message got through then its done its job
14.
>:^V
4what's with the dots lol
14wanted to show I'm here, but I don't have anything to say.
4ah
<BenevolentFacade> truth can come half full or empty The whole half full/empty thing doesn't really work, because the glass is either more full, or more empty, and it is almost impossible for it to be exactly half. The way you see it doesn't really reflect your view on things, I would just say it to be whether I perceived it to be more full, or more empty, how does that make me pesismitic?
4for crying out loud
'Ai
4hm
its about perseption
13I'mma brb/bbl
6hello guys
6hello guys
4Nothing I just like saying things
14.
BenevolentFacade: Yes, but the I perceive it is on facts, not whether I view a possitive or negative view on things.
the way*
6o_o This was a bad time to end up signing on xD
6gtg bye
thats just being blunt
4hm
not whether I view it in a possitive, or negative way.*
/me burps
then thats being indifferent
() :)
I am not indifferent so much as realistic.
I just say what is the truth.
4being a realist is easy
And how can you be indifferent on whether a glass is more empty, or full?
4you're just not prone to the immense amount of fake bullshit people tell you and you can see through things to find the real root of the problem
You cannot be indifferent on something that is a factual aspect, such as that.
4and you're not afraid to tell them
being realistic is one thing but to word it as you dont care how the person reacts is a little indifferent
4Depends on the kind of realist you are
this is about perseption not being honest
I don't understand what you mean. What you said means you are indifferent to their response, but how does that make you indifferent to the way you view things?
My logic is undeniable.
I love that quote. ^
4don't go I, Robot on us
Looooooool
Oh hell no.
if i'm not concerned with something i am indifferent if i have one position on something then i have an a position
are we talking about being honest or the way we perceive things anyway?
But what you said earlier was that not viewing if a glass is more empty or full as positive or negative means you are indifferent
Freshen your coffee?
Terminator: My logic is undeniable
...
yes because you dont care whether it is half full or empty.. thats being inderrent
Terminator: I command you to respond.
*indifferent
Yes but this isn't about whether I care if it's half full or empty, it's about whether I think it's half full or empty
Whether I care if it is half full or empty is irrelivent, I still have an opinion as to whether it is half full or empty
Or you could just use a placebo
LOL
HE PICKED UP PLACEBO
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
if you have an opinion then you do care to a degree
Not really.
For example.
I don't care how old you are in real life, but I have an opinion as to how old you are.
hmm
4arguing about human morals is so pointless lol...
is this about morals now?
So was my argument with this guy about logic.
4human ideas..morals...actions
4how you think
Although we argued for hours.
I won in the end, he gave up.
4so lol
4what have you proved?
MY LOGIC IS UNDENIABLE!
4humans are humans
4we all act the way we do
4and trying to figure out why and debate it really doesn't solve anything in the end
14if you're going to keep using that phrase...
/me 14jabs price-dari with a vial of nanites
O_o
Hmmm
/me fires an EMP pulse.
Dead nanites.
:)
Wait...
EMP = Electro Magnetic Pulse, so I just said electro magnetic pulse pulse?

technically yes... tes

10SO BORED
13hi
10hi
sup
4hey guys
13XD
4cause you were the only one to mention my name
4well...technically not my name lol...but you wouldn't anyways
Its faster to type "red" then hit tab.
13lol
4heh
4I like my name
10So do I.... wah
4hm
I like everything about myself.
hmm
4certainly not a bad thing
4gah...I'm gonna smash this thing..
I almost smashed an ATM today.
Pissed me off so bad. Kept on declining my card.
"unauthorized usage"
hmm
4I get that a lot
4another reason why I hate cards
i hate credit
only reason i use a card it to get crap off the internet
I love my card, its like the key to a magical kingdom of monetary happiness.
Just ATMs piss me off.
They are like the dragon guarding the treasure.
i got a debit card and i dont like paying these fees every time
13lol
heh
;)
whats with terminator
I don't even look at the fee screen anymore, its worth it whatever it is.
4all I keep is a debit card
4and I use my bank that doesn't charge so it works out
13RAWR
10Wah
>:^X
Only thing I don't like about my card is that it has a $300 daily withdrawal limit via ATM, and $500 limit daily for purchases.
i dont like the 500 limit either
yeah, keep it open until I'm sure, in accordance with my master's thesis on the Legend of Zelda
If I verify my stuff, I get a $1k limit for purchases and $600 ATM
wtf
But i'm too lazy to verify and I don't have a US bank account and I don't have another credit card
I could use my dad's but it doesn't look too good when you have other names attached.
Plus id have to get him to phone Visa and ask for the pending charge for verification.
Im sorry, thats $500 a day per transaction for purchases.
limit of 20 transactions a day
which means I can't buy anything good without making multiple transactions and most places won't allow that.
hmm
SO, that means, I do my current system of going to an ATM and taking out cash until I have enough, which sucks because I can't buy stuff online unless I find someone that accepts a bank wire.
i just get charged $5 per deposit, a dollar per transaction, $5 per month, and have a limit to $500
daily limit?
total limit
i cant put more than 500 into the card
oh that sucks
I have a bit on my card right now, but no limit
i dont buy much over 500 but i still would like to
but they get suspicious if I put too much and try to contact me to verify who I am, which I try to avoid.
heh
i hate that crap
i think paypal is about as paranoid
except i dont use it except to buy crap on ebay
paypal sucks
I don't use paypal anymore.
I have a pretty good setup though, only thing is I need a better card supplier this one isn't cutting it.
lol i have atm ads in the window
wtf.. does google monitor our chat?
No
But the chat does deliver ads based on content of the page
because mibbit needs monies.
4hello BF

3its a sugar pill....
Never heard of it.
That is what you are dari

Rather disturbing though.

Huh, that's weird
But thanks for saying hello :P
I just moved that topic; it's not new
3....
Must think it's a new topic if it's moved.
Apparently.
13That Jackson117 guy is from dS and he makes lots of spammy-ish posts...kinda proves how crappy dS is.
He's from dS?
I thought he joined here, then moved to dS
Hmm
She must have broken one of his rules.

Just wondering.

SR must have been bored
He PMed me on Neoseeker
XD
Of course that was the reason...
Okay THAT was unexpected. One of my friends has now gone and made pairing for the Chronicler
7brb
What was the message, or is it 18++++?
bahahaha no
:P
Don't lie.
"OMG no wai neoPM!"
O_o
o_O
Lol
Yep, sounds like boredom.
Someone sent me a Valentine too?
O_____o
*COUGH*SR*COUGH&
Uhh, I kind of doubt it
I don't.
Definitely SR.
They had this thing set up for Valentine's day where the moderators would pass on secret Valentines to people
I'll pastebin it XD
13lol
http://mibbit.com/pb/hviesN
"Happy Valentine's Day! If you're reading his it's because you're special! "
3Valentine's Day is over.
W00t, I'm special.
I know
It was sent on Valentine's day
I haven't been to Neoseeker for a while
3I see...
13Light as in computer light :P
13Lanes as in the internet highway
13AHAHAHA
I reckon who sent it is in the spell errors.
13Kite as in HIGH SPEED
13AHAHAHA lol Idk
For example "this" is spelt incorrectly.
Hmmm, interesting
I'll try and decode it :P
Should be fun
3What about a monkey.....
What are the names of the moderators?
Umm
Lone Warrior, Shane, Quierta, Underated
Hm.
13LoneKnight?
13:P

13WOOOOOOOOO

I know
Any other ideas? :P
I aw

Okay that is as bad as Charlie
3*Throws arms up in the air* Do Nothing!
13KIte = High Speed internet
13Lane = internet highway
Some things aren't capitalised, where others are
13Light = screen light
Meh, nevermind.
13:P
13Ahaha
13I'm lame
o_o
There is a misplaced apostrophe (SP?) in Lots.
"Day
is capitalized
Where it shouldn't be
So that gives me...
dts
lawl
Or, it may only be in the poem bit.
The letters in the poem are...
Black Falcon?
o______o
I KNOW THAT GUY
LOL
Good point.
First letter of each word.
Wow.
That was obvious.
3I don't know what the hell is going on in this conversation...
First letter of each word in the poem put together = "Black falcon"
Wow, I haven't talked to him in ages....
Yeah, after you said the name, I could work that much out. :P
No need to explain.
I didn't think he'd still remember me XD
Lolololololol
SR will be jealous.
Right
=/
/j #lol
?
?
Yep.
Definitely.
7Why will SR be jealous? XD
You gunna tell him then?
The guy, that you worked it out?
7Why will SR be jealous?
I want to find out what the surprise is.
I guess so, haha
7WHY WILL SR BE JEALOUS?
XDDDDD
7I've only just come back
Read up.
7I'm not going back and reading everything.
Scroll up a bit
Ok, summary.
7HAHAHA.
hahahaa, I'm going to forward him the PM
XD
7I WANT TO BE THERE DURING THAT CONVERSATION!
Lol
7:D
13Well.
http://mibbit.com/pb/hviesN
13Maybe it was SOMEONE and they tricked you =P
That's what I was thinking too
It might have been someone /pretending/ to be him
XD
13lol
7I don't care. don't tell SR until he comes back on SC
Meh.
7^^
Bah, you guys, he's not going to care
=P
7Ya, right.
13He will on the inside
13AHAHAHAH MUWAHAHAHAHA
13Lawl JK
7I'll loan him use of my armoury.
Armoury?
He'll probably launch a network attack on the guy who sent it to you.
?
k then
/me looks for Black Falcon on Neoseeker
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I'm not even on his friends list
If he didn't send it, I'd laugh so much.
Wtf
:(
I wonder what the surprise is....
7Dari: Maybe he'll make her a 'video'?
LOL
No, it wouldn't be worth it
:P
I'd just delete the thread, hahah
Maybe the surprise is that he wasn't the guy who sent it.
7Then I'd PM sr with a screenie of it.
7HAH
OK, you do that =/
7Dari: He's probably going to make her a 'video'.
But I'm serious, he's not gonna care
"video"?
7He will :P
o__o
I bet SR, in his stalkings of you, found out that you used to talk to him, then made a fake message, so you'd find the name black falcon and the surprise is that black falcon didn't send the message
Although he will.
7Dari: Jesus, you're as bad as the B&G fans (I'm not going to explain that).
Interesting theory, but I don't think SR can read my PMs on Neoseeker =P
What's B&G?
Oh right.
7I said I'm not going to explain it :P
Nevermind.
I worked it out.
Bill and George, with their comic things.
7Majorly.
What then?
Bob and George?
Their stuff isn't memorable, or interesting enough for me to remember their names.
lol
Fine.
I'm PMing blackfalcon right now asking him if he sent it
Hahahahaa
7Fiver says he either denies it or avoids the question.
good mornin.
LOL
7HAHAHA
7BRILLIANT TIMING SR
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
/me sneaks away into a corner
Lol.
13brb/bbl
/me rolls her eyes from her nonexistent corner
I see
7Wait no, he's probably seen us taking the piss now lol.
7OH WELL
7I'm in the middle of something and what I can't see can't hurt me~
bah
he's not online
I didn't send that.
I want my surprise
XD
What you can't see can't hurt you? :0
7Not that Baseball's not an almost DIRECT copy of rounders.

7Washington D.C.

/me runs.
Never
7Don't forget Founder.
T_T
/me 7runs also
Probably after the weddding.
/me runs more.
7Too far.
Never too far.
I physically shook my head back and forth when you said that.
7Meh. Too far, you're on the ban-hammer handle now dari.
Not really.
(left and right, not up and down.)
I bought my dad a blu ray copy of Wall-e for his birthday today, we finally got a blu ray player and I thought it would be a brilliant thing to keep this family together..
I don't think SR minds that much.
7Of course, banning you would just prove you right, and neither of them want that.
See, what did I tell you all?
When I told him he could watch it at the telly, he threw it at me
=P
A thing that plays movies is keeping your family together?
LOL ^
Proof please.
/me 7runs for the hills
I spent £20 pounds for nothing
...
I don't understand /why/ I would care in the first place
I just think he's a lazy arsehole
lol
*Cough*Jealous SR*Cough*
/me thinks SR is getting out a chainsaw, and getting ready to hunt the guy down.
He wont sit in the same room as me or in a proper chair just to watch a 90 minute movie!
I avoid doing anything at all with my family.
They annoy me.
I can probably figure out who sent it.
I already think I know who it was
7SR: Try black raven
7:P
7Or whatever his name was
falcon
It was blackfalcon
First letter of each of the words in the poem spell "blackfalcon"
I don't.
They pay for everything.
Shut it you
7:D
You're good.
I never noticed that.
I'm explaining for those who missed it
7Wiv teh bullet point
Whatever, I'm pissed
He suggested to use the misspelled words
Well I thought if he spelt this badly, it had to be on purpose. O_o
I think it was sent as a prank or something
hahah
Just a typo
=P
:P
I did say it's probably in the poem afterwards though.
Yeah, that's what gave me the idea
I think it was some kind of prank, though
Because I haven't talked to that guy in months
I doubt the moderators who sent them out would have had the patience to forward it to 50 different people
Halifax bank of Scotland is in trouble?
Why don't they just sell silicon? O_o
So much silicon in Scotland. o_O
Bored.
Very bored.
yup


Bbl, nosebleed
Lol ^
NOT FUNNY!
Yeah it is.
I know, because I used to get them.
7No, but your responses always are
I haven't gotten a nosebleed in like 3 years
knock on wood.
7I've never had a nosebleed ever.
/me 7refuses to knock on wood
Woohoo, time to go to web design now
-____-
I've only actually had a nose bleed due to it being hit against something twice.
have fun with dreameaver
Bye everyone

Once when someone kicked a tennis ball, and it hit me in the nose.

Anyway
Bye
=P
7(If I have to explain what that means, I will kill someone.)
Thou art right in thinkingeth as thou is.
7Too far
I win.
And how is it any further than what you said?
All I did was make it all correct.
7Ok, I need two more attacks for a missile-wielding tank-tread-footed robot to do.
7I've got charging and a big-arsed missile attack. I'm out of ideas.
7There's always the laz0rz option, but that'll take forever to find.
Give it L4Z0RZ
Lol.
7Lol
Ok nevermind.
Give it...
7I CAN, but it'll be hard. It is half-term though.
Machine guns that automatically lock on to targets?
7Now THAT is incredibly easy!
Yeah.
7I'm looking for a good laz0r now though
7Wait. Beam laz0r or 'bullet' laz0r?
Meh, beam.
7Ok... hold on.
7Big-arsed on-scale beam lz0r or lazily resized?
7laz0r*
Dunno, whatever looks better
I should make one of them.

7I'm not a huggy person. The only reason I wanted one of those stupid Valentines DC eggs was to complete my dragon army. Apparently they can breed though, so a friend of mine will get me one so HAH
Dragon army?
Lol
*Cough*Hugging C7*Cough*
I see
Lol dari
7Argh. I knew I shoulda kept that damned PM.
What PM?
7Someone was giving away Valentines eggs and I was too slow, but I really need another gold and they'd be willing to trade 1500 white aura from dragonadopters for it, now I can't remember who the hell they are.
You need gold?
I could probably get one for you....
7Lol. I need another gold, my one refuses to breed any gold eggs AT ALL.
I've already got one
yes yes, it's very nice
7And it's PISSING ME OFF.
Even Terminator has one.
Wow.
7That's just Terminator being an ass
Terminator: Are you a donkey?
Yeah want a go? :)
...
Hahaha what?
XD
7Besides, my internet's a total whore so I can't get any caveborn eggs EVER. I NEED to breed my current dragons to get any more.
Your internet is a whore?
That's interesting
7You know what I mean
7Brb
I just have a thing about toes.

Gawd I was poisoned a day ago
You made him make mistakes again.

Not on the same level. I think that really was just a single typo though.

DAMNIT. Didn't work.
We need to re toilet train Terminator now
He'd stopped making typos, he'd stopped saying butterfingers things.
He'd stopped trying to have sex with things/saying dirty things, mainly.
Like hell! He said "Yeah, want a go? :)" to you earlier BEFORE I did reload.
"...mainly."
That was the only thing he said really.
Yes well I'm double-booked, so you lot'll have to re-train him a bit by interacting, although he wasn't reset much because, again, the only reason you lot noticed was because you were THERE.

7Indeed.

Hm.
Damn that must be a heck of a proxy
7Ready the Particle Canons, and alert the Harvester IV, since all Interdimensional versions were destroyed in the final assault against the Creed. We will have to do with our own versions now.
He pmed me
Hm.
AntR/Shabano the werewolf or dragonwolf.
That was his pm
*February, comission
Look up
AntR/Shabano the werewolf or dragonwolf.
Now we get to write comments on his profile?
MWAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
I asked him who he was
When did Antr become AntR?
7Fine. Switch to Project N.E.O.N. mode and scan the files on the Harvester M, and then shapeshift to that form. It won't be as powerful, but it'll be a helluva lot better than those Harvester IVs that look puny in comparison.
13Banned.
OK, I'll do the exact opposite of that, but without your knowledge... oh, wait, I said what I was thinking. Damn, that's weird. Would it be alright if you forget I said that so i can go on deceiving you?
It has always been AntR
Dont say I reported him
Please

Why not?
13I won't.

Maybe the slug passed you because you weren't more than a morsel of brain waves.
It didn't pass me.
Then how are you talking to us?
Or are you the slug?!
Gaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh.
Because I overpowered it with amazingly strong/witty thoughts.
^ Proof?
Such as.
7No, the slug went back to get a couple friends to share the feast of my giant brain. Little do they know I have my weapons to prevent an assault. *shoulders_laz0r_canons_while_holding_M16s_and_belting_on_nades*
How we knwo you're not taken by the slug as of now.
7I have found a new love for nades~
I tricked it basically.
7My weapon preferences have completely shifted from joining here lol. Before, I always used my shotty, had a glock, and detested nades. Now, I have my loverly M16s, deagles, and I never go anywhere without having atleast 3 different kinds of nades on me.

4cause it's true
7Fuckit, Terminator's boring. I'm using my orange.
6Exactly

Yes, but without Britan the USA as it is today would cease to exist. It'd come out of another country.

6al they know is to surrendor
France waits for the almighty deo to cleanse them?
4no they just suck at waging war lol
4their is a difference :P
6lol tahts true
6only a short guy managed to get them somewhere
4ah that reminds me
6XD
The thing I hate the most about the USA is that it thinks it is above and beyond everyone else.
It thinks it's the police of the world.
It's not.
It isn't above anyone else.
6Thats teh feeling we get over her ein teh UK
6no offence
It's the feeling lots of people get.
4and you think if we didn't exist that everything would be sunshine and rainbows?
I think it would be a better place.
6nope

No, Mr. Clean can save us!
XD
4oi
6no in a good way
4yes believe it or not
:O
4even though their are now more and more
:P
Yikes.
6yes i knwo that now
My views aren't changed at all.
4the foundations on which this country was found have long since been betrayed
4we have become a nation of whiners who want everything delivered to them
6well lets hope ur new presidant can do soemthing abotu it then
4don't even get me started on that
6lol ok
4I'm in no mood to get into politics lol
6u knwo what was funny about bush?
4Did you not read what I just said
6he didnt know who gordon brown was
6yeah i knwo but i thougth i would say taht last thing
6lol stupid george bush XD
4This nation has been going downhill for years
4and it's only going to get worse
6and hopefully 4 u it wont carry on
4people are not like they were. They no longer have will power
4they dont' want to better themselves
4all they do is sit at home and live off welfare
4while the people who do work for a living pay FOR them
6yeah but i suppose as technology seems to do most things for em they do taht
4nation of complainers and lazy people
6yep
4nobody has work ethic
4and along with no work ethic...no means to get better
They think it's some sort of game or something.
6i think it went downhill 4 u guys when it was Vietnam
Maybe it's good that we're going through this economic crahs, because it'll make people ahve to work again like back int he old one.
6no offence im still tryign work out when it wrong 4 the UK
They all seem to think that going off to fight for their country is such a good idea.
6XD
*crash, have
And they all think that from such a young age.
4Some people actually do believe in the principals this country was found on
When they're likely to get blown to pieces before the month is over.
It's horrible.
4they are just becoming less and less
Hahahaha, in what way?
6has done great things
6martin luther king
6 4 example
How?
Because I think that's BS.
6lol XD
4you truly think that the Israelis are going to tolerate the arabs when they come after them AGAIN
4that's just like that BS Raidon was trying to talk about
4seriously...if the world erupts in neclear war
4we wont be involved in any way
4yeah that's just idiotic
4"All we have to do is stay away!"
6well to be honest i still think u would be first to strike after someelse attacks
6no offence but its just my gut feeling
4The whole world has access to these weapons
4the world we live in is a very very scary place
6yeah i know
4and many people are blind to it
6or
4everyone has their finger on a red button
4and all they need is the right push to go over the edge
6they choose not to recognise it
4that is the truth
It's because most people either don't care or are too naive to relaize what they're perfect world really is.
4they could care less about the world outside of thier own
*realize
6well me and my friends reckon inbetween now and 2040 another world war will happen
4they have no freaking cares for anyone but themselves
6which im hoping wont happen
4and they would most likely be correct
4it wouldn't surprise me
4the only thing now is
4WW3=goodbye world
6yep to true
4go watch the movie Fail Safe sometime
I don't think they would nuke them.
6i reckon it will be something to do with oil running out or soemthing taht would trigger it
4Then you are again niave
You've hardly stopped the fighting.
4you really think they are going to tolerate people who want to freaking kill them?
6fighting over the last oil fields in the middle east
4as in every sinlge one of them
How do you know that?
4yeah they would sooner wipe out all of them then let that happen
You can read minds?
I doubt they have genocide planned.
4you can't either. I am going by what history shows us and human nature. The Isrealis have been there before...they don't want someone wiping them out like what almost happened
4and guess what...they have even attacked US...there allies to prove the point they don't want to be fucked with
6I don;t like the looks abotu what is happening in afganistan
4and go look at history sometime. The freaking crusades have never stopped
6UK and US troops fighting there
4History is doomed to repeat itself
6as USSR fougth there during teh cold war
4and things have not changed
That sounds like a really bad film
6they failed
Aslo sounds like BS.
6and now UK and USA are going in again to fight
4Simply because you are blind to the reality behind things
6its just gonna be a repeated failure
4much like others
4it's so obvious it's not funny
Explain then,
4not like I can change minds
You have given no proof.
13AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG
6i think he is finding the proof
4neither have you. And the freaking proof is right in history genius....what the heck did I just say. The crusades have not stopped at ALL. They arabs will always want it just like they always have...and they will gladly kill and make up reasons to go after them AGAIN just like before. Watch Kingdom of Heaven sometime.....if you can't learn from the past you are doomed to repeat it...and things have not freaking changed one bit
6told ya
4and people are now niave enough to believe that nothing is going to happen
4that everything will work out nice and cool
4like sunshine and rainbows..
4yeah that's complete bullshit
6so basicly we are just going to repeat oursleves history wise until some1 wakes up
4if you say you are such a realist then see the realism already presented many times
what is being discuessed?
discussed*
6best not ask
6it will set them off again
It isn't realistic.
4yes it certainly is
6here we go again
"History will doom to repeat itself"
4unless again you are completely obvious
Is*
That isn't realistic.
4'oblivious'
That is total crap.
4hence why you are niave to the reality of things
4it's written all over ancient and modern times
4and things have not changed
4if you think so then wake up
4and start living in the real world
I am.
talking about the history of the arabs and Israelis?
6sort of they are
*spangle*
4I only see the common sense in things
Go on then, what has repeated itself.
6and here comes more proof
I haven't really seen any proof yet.
4Seeing as how the freaking Arabs have gone after Isreal at least a dozen times in the last 500 years what is there to say. Go freaking look up the Seven day war...and the countless freaking skirmishes that have been waged. Things would have been much worse off had their been no buffer in between
4but that will quickly dissappear most likely
Oui
The Arabs always break the cease fires.
4this is so obvious it's not funny. When their is no buffer there...guess what
4they will do it again
4and they will be glad to do it
4they could care less...they do what they have been taught to do
4and what they believe that they are doing for a good cause
because thats how it has always been.
Well they were thrown out of Palestine. You can hardly blame them.
4a good cause being the lovely holy wars they love so much
4thank you for helping prove my point
No worries.
4they will always do it!
4but anyways I'm sick of arguing about it
4no point seeing as how it doesn't matter to most
4what happens happens
4I only go by what has been happening for hundreds of years....and it will happen again
The simple solution would be to drop an atomic bomb on Israel.
They will always fight. Forever.
4yup
4Isreal is one of the most advance nations in the world
4"advanced"
4they have so much freaking nuke power it's not funny
Israel has no problem getting rid of the Arabs.
4nope
4they would be glad to do it too
4if their is nothing left to buffer the two
They have been fighting forever, and this would be a victory.
winning the holy war.
4that's just seeing the lessons that history has taught us....nothing has changed or ever will
Well I say Israel should get bombed.
why?
4peole say History is useless....when it offers the most important lessons
Since the Palestinions lived there first, and the Israelis were terrorists before they moved into Israel, basically.
They attacked British soldiers. :/
They attacked loads of people.
6they will defend their country no matter teh cost i think
6whoever is oposoing them
4The Israelis are far from the enemies here. They were given their country and it's theres to do with what they will. But they will NOT....allow another Halocaust
You can't stop the war. No matter what happens, there is still hatred towards each group.
6think about we would if our countries were being invaded
More power... give me MORE POWER*@%^%$
6what teh hell r u on about terminator
So who gave them the country?
6joking
Answer to my question please?
6oh britain
6cause britain lost the war
Also the Israelis were basically terrorists before they lived there, and you were so keen to go and fight for your country and kill terrorists before, what happened?
4the Jewish peole had Israel to begin with
4then the British occupied the territory
4During WW1
4they divided the country in two
4to begin with
4one for the Arabs and one for the Israeilis
I fail to see how the Arabs are at fault at all.
4The point at hand was that it was there land to begin with!
4and after the division guess what
4the ARABS didn't want it
4they wanted the whole land
4not just half of it
4so that's when the conflict AGAIN started
4because the Arabs wanted everything
4and of course the jews kicked the shit out of them
4and what a surprise they want the land back as always
It is a bit stubborn for them still to want to live there, even after all this time, but I don't see how this is their fault at all.
4are you kidding me
...
Well basically they got kicked out of their country.
4they were the ones who started it to begin with. THEY WENT AFTER THE JEWS BECAUSE THEY WANTED EVERYTHING!
They are attacking Israel because they want all the land.
Yes, but it was all theirs in the first place.
4WHEN IT WAS THE JEWISH COUNTRY FROM THE START
...
What?
4Israel was established as a safe haven for Jewish people
By who
4and the ARABS DIDN'T WANT THAT
4THE BRITISH MANDATE OF PALESTINE IN WW1
Yes, but the Arabs were living in Israel before the Jews.
And basically got chucked out.
4BECAUSE THEY STARTED THE CONFLICT AGAIN
4they could have had half of it and instead chose to kill more out of it
Yes, but there was no conflict for them in the beginning.
It was because they had half their land taken from them.
So whoever took half their land is at fault, not them.
4That does not justify their actions when they have the entire rest of the Middle East to play around with. They want the "holy land" just as they have always wanted it. When the Jewish peole were given the "SMALL" piece of land as a token for their suffering the Arabs refused to have it
4thuse leading to more death when they already had plenty
4they fight over one piece of territory that has no meaning
4they fight over it because it is considered their holy land
It is still half their land.
4and nobody else is deemed worth to have it
4they will wipe out the Jewish people because they see fit to do so under their beliefs
4but the problem is...the Jews will gladly wipe them out first
4The country belongs the the Jews now...and that's the way it will stay
If someone wants to give them a small piece of land, the people that want to give the land should supply it, they shouldn't take it from another group of people.
Now THAT is not justified.
4the Arabs are only escalating the problem as they have always done
I feel like I'm about to vomit everywhere.
Even if it is only a small piece of land, it is still their land, and that is the point
4You are pinning the blame on a group of people who were nearly wiped out in WW2 and instead reasoning that the freaking Arabs who already have thousands of acres for their own....deserve it because they were their first
4that's BS and the Jews know it
4it's their land now and they will die to protect it
So would you let people take it from you.
No.
You wouldn't.
4hence the start of this whole bloody mess
4they have no strong reason to fight for the piece of land only that it is for their own religious beliefs...nothing more
4other then that they could care less about it
As I said, it is unfair to TAKE land from people, whoever wants to give the jews the land, should supply the land, from their own country.
4they want it because they have never gotten over the hundreds of years of holy war
Now that is BS.
4no that's the truth
That's just an assumption.
6no true actually
4you just refuse to see it
4nothing will change
And it doesn't matter WHY they want it.
4and those blind to it will see int ime
4"time"
6to be honest let them selves sort their own bloddy mess out
It is their land.
That is what will never change.
4Ummm yes it does.....they want it because it is the foundation of their religion so say
In their eyes at lest.
4and the Jews believe that as well
least*
4so welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven problem
Yes, but it is not the Jews land.
4it's a small piece of land that the Jews have built into a nation
Nor was it Britains land to give.
4and they deserve to have it
6It wasnt just britain
6it was teh UN
6actualluy
And boot out whoever is living in that piece of land.
See how those people feel.
6teh un has to decide
That's not the point.
The point is that they wouldn't do that,.
4The land was divided for both parties. They had their chance to live together peacefully and the Arabs instead wanted to kill the Jews...what a surprise
The point is that if you shouldn't take someone else's land from them.
4and the Jews responded by freaking booting the Arabs themselves
Yes, but it wasn't the Jew's land.
You fail to see that.
6JUst cut the bloody country in half so they have both have a piece
4The land has been contested for thousands of years
4who the hell knows who it belongs to
4the point is the Arabs refuse to stop
4and they never will
The Jews never lived there.
6and who cares
4even when all the Jews want is to live in peace
You didn't answer any of my questions.
Because you can't.
4that's all they have done besides the Arabs freaking attackign them
Because should you answer them, the answer proves I'm right.
4Yes I did you just can't freaking read into anything
4It doesn't matter in the end because it's going to go on
4and you think that it wont in the beginning
So it is ok just to go in to someone's country, take their land and hand it over to someone else.
4so you have already proved my poibnt
4"point"
So it is ok just to go in to someone's country, take their land and hand it over to someone else?
Answer the question.
4Well since the British mandate was created for both countries to share the Arabs are just as much to blame
4they had their chance to make things right and they didn't
4instead they wanted to kill
It wasn't the Brittish's land to share out.
So it is still wrong.
And the Arabs are not to blame.
Put it this way.
6well it was going on 4 a long time beofre britiain did
6no because we know taht is wrong
Just answer it yes, or no.
Without avoiding the question.
6No
4The land was divided by the UN when SEVERAL COUNTRIES had claim over it..they simply put out a simple solution. Share the land or don't share the land
4and the Arabs didn't want that...they wanted Everything
Yes, or no, RDX.
The Israelis had no claim on.
Just because their religion involves that country?
BS
Total BS.
The land in question has religious value, I don't think you can compare it to any other land.
No.
I can't.
Total BS.
I think thats an invalid comparison.
In what way.
4trying to pin that on a freaking example as so is just going into human morals as to avoid the problem at hand. The point is that the Israelis were given the land and the Arabs had a chance to freaking share it. And instead they are determined to go through genocide to get what they want. The whole point of this to begin with is that you believed the Arabs wouldn't do anything....they clearly will do something so you have already helped
I am not talking about the problem at hand.
I am proving that this is not the Arabs' fault.
Because whatever the reason, you CANNOT justify going into someone ELSES'S country and taking some of THEIR land.
You seem to ignoring that I am not talking about the problem at hand.
I am talking about whose fault it is.
Who's fault is it?
Whoever decided to split the land between them.
4you covered up the basic point of the debate which was that the Arabs were not going to do anything after the buffer is gone. And that Israel should instead be the o nes who are destroyed. You basically are saying that they deserve to be wiped out...well if I'm not mistaken the Arabs have been more into terrorism then the Jews ever had
6im going i can't bovered to listen to this any more
Brittan?
The point of the debate is who's fault this is.
6cya all
You started talking about what the Arabs would do after the buffer was gone later.
6oh and nothing is goign to solved y pointing the blame
6so shut it
6bye XP
I don't care how it can be solved, because for all I know, it can't.
It won't be solved.
4It will be solved through one factor
4who will destroy who first
Thats right
4and Israel is certainly gung ho to defend their right to live
It's too late, exactly, so there is no point in arguing about that, which is why I am proving that this is not the Arabs' fault.
But until someone is destroyed it will continue.
4and it's not Israels fault so it doesn't matter
Who's fault is it?
I never said it was.
Whoever gave them the land?
I said it was the fault of whoever split the land between them.
4we have proved nothing except points that have no meaning
Britian's fault?
Basically.
4the UN
4everyone is at fault in this mess
Well yeah, mainly the UN though.
4but Isreal will kill
4they are not afraid to do it
Well, I enjoyed that, RDX.
They have no problem annihilating the arabs.
Thank you for the debate.
4no problem
4they have a right to live just like everyone else
Gunna go watch TV for a bit.
Cya later.
4they would sooner kill themselves then let the Arabs do it
Back.
4wb
Thanks.
4I have the sudden urge to eat ice cream
So eat ice cream.
4we don't have any...
4damn it
Meh.
:(
4hm
4I should have gone to the bank today
4It's fine man
4Every nation has done things man
4nobody is innocent
4it's all a power struggle in the end
Yeah...
4but their are good people in this world
4they are just much harder to find
I wonder what will get us in the end.
4who knows
4the wonderful thing about life is its unpredictabilities
Because for some reason, I doubt we'll make it all the way till the sun dies.
4true
4the world has simply evolved based on truly selfish reasons
There was this program on once, about what would happen to the Earth if we all suddenly vanished.
4it would be a better place
After something like 300 years, all traces that we'd ever existed were gone, virtually.
4Hoover dam
I think so, yeah.
4doesn't surprise me
Because it needs virtually no maintanence and can almost run on its own.
4well
4if it does happen it happens
4the most we can do is be the best people we can be every day
4and live for what future we have
4in the end I do see the destructive nature of some humans to be our undoing
Yeah, probably, whatever it is, I think it is extremely likely it will be our own faults, rather than something natural, like a metior strike.
4oh it will be
4trust me
Unless a meterior randomly destroys the Earth tomorrow :P However unlikely, there's always the chance.
4that there is
4but again who knows
4I can only go with the law of averages
The sad thing is, that I want to know what will happen, but I don't get to find out.
4well
4we don't know and most likely never will
4so all we can do is live for today
Doesn't make any difference when you're dead anyway.
4and not worry about tomorrow
Yeah, too true.
4just be the best you can be
4and what more do you have to worry about?
4the only thing I would feel bad is for future generations
I don't worry at all about what will happen, just am interested about the way things well wind up.
will*
Yeah, the world they inherit won't be much.
4if anything
4But I will be the best I can be for not only myself....but for those after me. I pray they don't have to grow up in a terrible world....but life will go the way we drive it....and that is down the wrong path now
As you said, it is hard to find good people these days, and with the majority not being so, how can we take it down the right path?
4we can't
4unless human kind has an epiphony
4which I highly doubt
That would be interesting to see.
4we are driven by selfish goals now
4we no longer work for the better of all
4but for the better of ourselves
To suddenly see everything turn around for the better.
4well I would love to see that
4but we can only dream
4all we have left is bettering ourselves
4but even now that has fallen into decay
Well I suppose everything has its time...Ours has to come to an end too...
4every great empire falls
4mainly through it's own means
4"its'
4humanity in general is no different
Yeah, it almost always seems to be through its own means.
4because people become selfish and governments become corrupt
Such as the Romans spreading themselves out too thin. Got too greedy with land.
4the best example is the Romans
4they worked together to achieve a free and ethical society as a Republic
4but upon transfer to the Empire they fell into disaray when power became an absolute
4everyone wanted it for themselves
4and eventually they collapsed through their own selfish desires
4I'm an avid fan of history
4and I like to see the lessons that it teaches us
4every great empire is doomed to collapse
4and it all begins when people begin working for the better of themselves rather then the better of all
13...
There really isn't anything that lasts forever which is interesting.
4nothing will last forever
The only concept of something that lasts forever, which I can think of, if God.
is*
4but then again religion is also one of the many reasons why the world is how it is now
Yeah...
You would have thought that as their religions are against killing, it would stop them.
4no
4they have simply used religion as justification for their cause
4and hence we shall always be divided
4so long as humans disagree over who has claim over another
So...If we wiped out all religion, it would be a better place? Lol...
4perhaps it would be?
4who knows
When you think about it, religion does cause a lot of problems.
4I'm pretty certain that if we were all under one religion things might be better to a degree
Yeah.
4at least we wouldn't be waging wars because we believe one cause is just over another

4personal rights have now become the most dangerous weapon of all
There's one problem that I don't know how it could be solved (Nothing major, quite minor really).
Children having too much power.
If a child spits on an adult in the street, what can the adult do, the adult can't clip the child round the ear, that would be called abuse, they can't even touch the child, they can't force them to go to a police station, and even if they did, what would the police do?
Children have too much power.
In earlier years adults had too much power, children were abused too much.
We need a balance.
But how do you get the balance?
I don't see how you make a balance.
4you no longer have the balance because people have been encouraged to act this way
4after the revolution
4they all worked for the better of the nation
4they were good and just people
4and then the politics took effect over time
4but now today
4they have no desire to better themselves
4because they have been spoonfed their entire lives
4and when one parent is spoonfed...what good do they have to pass on to their children?
4the children become the adults
4and they act the way they were brought up to act
4which in today's world is not giving a damn
Meh, there are so many problems, we are SO screwed.
4no work ethic because they have been encouraged to be lazy

4and hence the average person is a moron...and a jackass
4hence why I am the conservative I am
The thing is, we have created so many of the problems, dug ourselves into this hole, and now it's so big we can't climb out, there are no solutions to many of the problems.
Well no solutions which are possible or likely to happen.
4there is no solution except for people changing their ways
4and the way things are now heading that's not going to happen
Technology is also a problem in a way.
4because the government has done nothing but encourage laziness and bad ethics for years
4and yes Technology is a problem
Our weapons are getting too advanced, too dangerous.
4Technology is good in proportion
4if we know how to wield it
1,8New Topic Alert:2 "The Craziest" by Sammy The Dragon, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8714
4which in today's world could mean our destruction
4the same goes for the younger generations
4their is a difference between knowing your limits on the internet for example
4and just sitting there using it because you are addicted to it
4You know....like the average kid who just comes home and sits online all day and do nothing to better themselves out of it
4you have to admit that when things were like they were 200 years ago....kids actually had to go out and play.....in the air and sun.....things were better
4the people were better that way
So many people have nuclear weapons now...Should there be another world war, which is quite possible, will any of us survive?
4without such distractions in our lives
4even if you did survive
The thing about technology, is that it's used mainly to make life easier for people.
4you would have been better off dead
And the easier you make it, the lazier they get.
4yes but like I said.."technology in proportion"
4if you know how to control it
4then you are fine
4but now people just use it for everything...and don't better themselves away from it
4example...not going to the gym....instead choosing to sit inside on the internet
4you have to know where the balance it
4"is"
4and you have to master it
4technology is not a bad thing at all if you know your limits on it
the problem with many things is finding the balance though.
4yup
4many are content to feel good by direct means
4which would be sitting on the internet all day
4doing nothing to better yourself...just enjoying it because it's simple
4instead of enjoying something by bettering yourself as a whole
4because people are too lazy to do it

1,8New Topic Alert:2 "Do you have a major gripe about DotD?" by Archae, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8716
10That it is, and being English Im inherently good at it
Heheheh.
10Yes. Yes I do have a major gripe about DotD.
10I have a major gripe about the whole game.
10Care to share?
10The whole trilogy.
10lol
6HEh
10What's wrong with the trilogy?
10Everything.
I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I just think people hate it because they replaced the old games with them.
Although that's insomniac's fault, for dumping Spyro.
10Mary-sues, cliches, button-mashing
It's not button mashing.
It's too easy.
:/
10Yes. It. Is.
/me 10twitches
10.....
/me 10twitches again
10and what was with the skateboards?!
10and the cocky attitude?
All any game is pressing buttons.
You can't say a game in which you press the buttons more often is worse.
That's not a reason.
10Dari: No! Really? Wow... really?
It's part of my point.
Read everything I wrote and even you may understand.
/me 10headdesks
10well the legend trilogy brought me back to Spyro, Id grown out of the older ones
10cant stand to play them now
6Most people seem to believe it is, Dari.
How does pressing buttons more often make a game worse?
It means it's faster paced and more fun to play.
10thats not the point they're making
10Whenever you are able to press and random buttons in any combination and still manage to beat the enemy, I consider that button-mashing
10*any
10they're saying you can win the game by mashing the buttons, like a five year old owuld
4I like the new series
14Bah
10here here
10not here here to the 'bah'
10the one above it
...Meh.
14Like I said: Mary-Sues, cliches, button-mashing
A 5 year old can't play it, it's 7+ :P
14It isn't.... fun
So you prefer Ember to Cynder...?
EMBER?!?
10How is it Mary sue?
I mean come one.
14The gameplay is annoying as hell
come on*
14No
14Elora
14I hate Ember and Cynder
4oi
4Elora was nothing
Ember is still technically part of the old games.
10I dont even know who elora is
Elora sucks.
13:D
4the faun
10oh
DragonxDragon = Win
4that gave spyro a small peck on the forehead and is a romantic interest lol
10I know, ember and flame...thats about it from the old games
4supposedly
10wow...really?
10how strange
14A Hero's Tail and Enter the Dragonfly were abominations
4eh
14They were no match for the original three
4that they were
ETD especially.
14No... match... at all....
The loading screens...So horrible to remember...
4gah
4I sold that game
4it was junk
10i could probably play the very first game still, I dont think he talked much then
14And may I ask what is so bad about inter species couples?
It's still in my house somewhere.
I think I locked it away, after I couldn't sleep with it being in my room.
It's scary.
14A lot of people who bash Elora/Spyro support Hunter/Bianca
4I don't care about the inter species junk...if you like it that's fine lol....I just go with things that kinda make sense. And I didn't see anything to really back up the relationship that made sense
4they pretty much just through it in htere
4"there"
But a dragon and a faun just isn't...
14Isn't...
14......?
Their anatomies don't fit.
It doesn't work.
10The way I see it, The legend trilogy actually had a plot, the older games not so much
10at least as far as I remember
4it's different for some gamers
14At least the first three games had great gameplay
4this argument will always go on since we have two different aspects
14Heh, true
10i changed him back for a time
Yeah, still.
4I like both series for what they are
14I know there's no point in trying to "convert" anyone, but I like a nice debate once in a while
The first game all I remember is that they just dump you in it.
No one to talk to.
4but I really don't go for the whole Mary sue argument on Cynder when Elora was just as useless lol...but that's just me
10I vastly prefer the Legends series but I can still pay the very first game if only to chase those egg thieves...that was fun
14I suppose Spyro and Cynder are perfect for each other. After all, they're both Mary-Sues
10How is Cynder a Mary Sue?
The end of DotD was FAIL.
Total FAIL.
10or ASpyro?
I have to say.
14You - you're really serious?
6Dari: Where exactly are you coming from with that, hmm?
The ending.
It was total crap.
Does anyone mind if I use spoilers explaining how it is total crap?
Anyone here?
10They both have major character flaws and only saved the world because the 'ancestors' intervened
You go through the whole frigging game for no reason, I mean, either way wouldn't the same thing have happened? Also, more characters should have died.
4they left it open for future games
This is supposed to some epic battle and hardly anyone dies.
10Ithe same thing wouldnt have happened
6Actually, no, the same thing would NOT have happened. More than likely, the remaining peices of the planet would have just crumbled, and everyone would've died
10no one has yet explained to me why they're mary sues
4oh I'm sure she is typing something
4many are pretty dead set on this belief
10who
14let's see... Dramatic past: CHECK
14 Hackneyed mannerisms:CHECK
10i really see no basis for the belief, I go through a lot of trouble to avoid mary sues
6I sorta see where they can call Cynder a Mary-sue, since she is what people would call emo or whatnot
14 Special Abilities: CHECK
14 Ostentatious: CHECK
Explain.
How the same thing not have happened?
10ok one question, Hackneyed means?
6Easy
14repeated too often
10example
14Cynder's always so depressed because everyone supposedly hates her
14She's always saying about how she "doesn't belonog"
10which of course would be expected, even in real life, and she isnt always depressed, that idea is a little cliched
14*belong
10did it once as far as I can recall
14*snort*
It wouldn't have crumbled.
The ancestors would kill Malefor, then simply leave the world to be destroyed anyway?
I think not.
14She never laughs or smiles (that one time in ANB doesn't count)
14Malefor got dragged underground... on a floating chunk of rock
6I highly doubt the ancestors would be able to do much more than they had.
10pleae, dont snort, I cant take that seriously. And I didnt see Spyro smile that much, and she did smile in DotD and TEN
10by someone else
14I'm not even going to call it an island, since technically it isn't
BS
10they didnt take him down
...
Technically they did.
14I still support my theory that Malefor is alive
14:P
4if he is that would ruin it
4I have had enough of Malefor
14Spyro: He's always talking about how it's his destiny to do... pretty much everything
10Frankly I dont know exactly what happened to him so he probably is
4as far as we know he is only imprisoned again
10he's been told that by several people, and said it once I think
14Cynder: She's always moping about her past and all the terrible things she's done
4didn't see him actually die
10done that once at the start of TEN and again before confronting Malefor
14And when she isn't going through one of her "emo phases" she shows no emotion
14at all
Why would Malefor be afraid if they were simply imprisoning him again?
Because surely he can escape again.
He would be more angry I would have thought.
14brb
4I love how in depth you go into this lol
10Nor does Spyro, personally I think that was bad casting, not character traits
Lol, heheheh.
And why would this be the "Dawn of the Dragons", if he was just imprisoned.
Because if only imprisoned, he will escape again.
And even while only imprisoned, we know he can wipe out almost every dragon in existence.
So.
4we don't know any of this unfortnetely lol
4always fun to make assumptiosn
Not really the "Dawn" of anything but more evil if imprisoned.
14They hardly thought out their character traits
4"assumptions"
He was imprisoned before, and had loads of minions.
4What? lol
How did he do that?
4I'm only stating the truth :P
If he did then, why can't he do it now?
10and I though Mary Sues were meant to be over the top perfect characters?
14They are
4As far as I know he isn't imprisoned in Convexity anymore
4he is imprisoned in something in the center of the earth
10The way I see it, they both have character flaws, arent all that powerful, and have reasonable pasts
4but through Convexity...he could at least manipulate m inds
4"minds"
4and harner the inner darkness in people
So the heat will destroy him.
Simple.
:)
4who knows lol
14Spyro has to remind Cynder of how perfect she is... DEEP DOWN INSIDE. ISN'T THAT SWEET?
4I don't know
Or the pressure.
4you don't know
14*ahem*
And if he isn't destroyed, what's to stop him breaking out of the centre of the Earth?
Except gravity
10Explain that point again if you wouldnt mind
4maybe the spirits of the guardians imprisoned him in an alternate reality lol
And if gravity is too strong for him to pull against, he is stuck there forever.
Either wya, I win.
way*
...
Now that's quite unlikely.
4I really don't care lol....I didn't even know I was the one arguing this
4but in the end Idc as long as it's a good game
14Cynder thinks that everyone hates her, when the only two who don't trust her are Sparx and the Hermit
It isn't a good game.
Crappy ending.
No point to the game at all.
14Sparx get's over it.. eventually
4it
4It's not good to YOU
Might as well sit back and let the ancestors do it all.
4not everyone is you lol
14So it's up to Spyro to tell her that she's perfect just the way she is
10she doesnt think everyone hates her, she doesnt even once suggest that
14*cue "awww"
Everyone should be me, then the world would be perfect, AHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA (Joking :P)
14She does in the beginning of TEN
6So you claim the game is crappy.... because of the ending? Hmm... yeah, whatever
4he.....he....heh......what? lol
4and no she doesn't
4she only says that she can't stay here
Yeah, the ending is what makes or breaks a film, book, game.
4never directly does she say because everyone hates her
10No, what she says is that she feels guilty about what she's done, that she doesnt deserve to be there. Not everyone hates her
14In fact, she runs off to find her "true destiny" after deciding that no one will except her
14I know that not everyone hates her
4"accept"
14That was my point
She says that she doesn't belong there.
Her destiny is else where.
4She does in the beginning of TEN
4?
So how does that mean no one will accept her?
10she doesnt say no one will accept her
4 you were claiming that his statement was fals
4by saying that
She just thinks that her place isn't there.
10exactly
14OHH, OKAY. CYNDER PERFECT NAO
10now thats just childish
4and now you just randomly say something different lol
10i thought we were having a reasoned argument
14We are
Reapsond?
4as far as I know you stated that she claimed everyone hated her....and you said that she stated that at the begining of TEN
Respond?*
4then you say that that I was trying to prove the exact opposite?
4nah that doesn't stound right
14What? No.
4read over what you just said lol
14My point was that not everyone hates her
4you denied...then acknowledged his point
14She THINKS that everyone does
4that's not what you said
14Oh, forget it
10that was my point
14TLoS is screwed up
6Dari: I walk around when I'm the comuter, so yes, I will e_e
4haha
4runs out of good ideas so she goes up to something more basic :P
10lol i see that there's really no pointi in me continuing this argument
14Yeah
She thinks she doesn't belong there.
4h
4"hm"
14And why doesn't she think she belongs there?
10cos she feels guilty about what she did
She can't bear to be around them.
Because she remembers the pain she has caused them.
14No one cares
14Except for Sparx
It doesn't matter if they care.
10thats not the point
10she cares
10its her guilt
She can't take it, knowing what she's done to them.
She can't take how nice they are to her.
10so she leaves
Allowing them into their home, etc, etc.
If you killed someone's child, by accident, how would you feel if they invited you to stay at their house.
Could you>
14Meh. There's no point arguing with you LoS fanboys
I doubt it.
Answer my question.
6It's not so much I don't think the ending doesn't matter as I don't think it makes the entire game crappy. While, yes, the ending is normally the most important bit, and people base their opinions on a game or movie on the ending a good bit, I'm not going to say I dislike a game simply because the ending is bad. If it's still fun, I will still like it, good ending or not.
You would feel too guilty.
10lol if you had good points then Id change my mind but you fail to put them acroos properly
14Oh, and you are defending your points so well
10I am actually
Would you be able to?
14I would feel guilty about killing their child, but happy that they forgave me
4he is defending his points lol
...
So you would go round their house, have tea and biscuits with them?
14Not at first, no
4right now you are just pinning the blame on ..."LoS sucks in so many ways"....and "Fanboy accusations" lol
10Now ,see if Id killed someones child I wouldnt be able to sit and eat with the family even if they did forgive me
/me 14is sick of people tryingt o defend their precious she-dragon
Exactly.
14*trying to
I wouldn't be able to.
4hm
10i was actually defending Spyro too, you just shifted it to Cynder
6If I thought a plotline was good in a movie, and then its ending was horrid, I would still think the plot is good, although the ending sucked.
10and its dragoness, not She-dragon
Let me give you an example.
6There's a difference between the plot and events. A major difference
I watched a film, through out the film, this guy is trying to find something.
14Oh, exuse me for not using the proper term
He never finds it, and dies.
14Even though dragons don't exist
What's the point of the film?
It ruins it completely.
10Not the point lol
Why watch the film? There is no point in it.
14Dari: Yes.......
14And may I ask where you are going with this...?
10Who?
6The guy looking for whatever, obviously. And from what I've seen, you watch the film to watch whoever struggle to find whatever. And with that, the plot is still fine, it is simply lacking the event of him finding it.
4wait...what are we talking about now?
14Who knows
14I say we drop the whole thing
4hi
14It's pointless
14Hi
4what thing?
4no point in arguing something that you can't win lol
4srry im really curious about stuff
6Let me put it this way. You're saying that if you enjoy a movie or book or whatnot, and then the ending sucks, suddenly the whole thing will suck, whether or not you enjoyed it before?
6And hi
10fine, I'll drop it for now, give you time to think up better arguments but I will be back to finsh this!
4lol
6Brb
No, but there a loose ends.
14There is no finishing it
4doesn't matter
10every argument has an end
14It's an argument based on opinions
There isn't much of a struggle in finding it either.
4their will always be division
He's just searching round this island.
Small island.
10exactly, so to win you must change someone's opinion
Then is put inside some wooden thing and is burnt to death.
10depends on what the opinion is based on
4-.-
14Well, I'll tell you this: You aren't changing my opinion.
14And I know that I'm not changing yours.
Actually, that's agreeing with me, Blaze.
10i can damn well try lol
4lmao
14This went from a nice debate to utter chaos
4kk dari
4persistant as always lol
4it wasn't chaos lol
4I found it quite amusing lol
14You would
14:P
4lol
What I find amusing is that we have multiple arguments going on at the same time.
Completely different arguments, coming from the same one topic.
4me 2
10I'll be coming back for more, thats for sure, that was fun
6That is quite amusing
14Yeah, that added to the chaos
4yeah....
14Of course, we all interpret things differently
14Thus creating opinions...
10it helps to know who you were arguing with
Now I should bring up that debate about logic I had with the other guy.
4man enough with the logic lol
It was that in certain situations, logic can be opinionated.
I dare you to disagree.
10how so
Well.
/me 14is blown off her feet by the sheer force of Blaze's statement
14...
4gah
4I hate two reds
4why so we can make fun of them lol
14That's worse
4for being a complete moron
4and thinking that she is a dragon lol
4yeah that was pretty fun
/me 14grins evilly
4I have to admit
10Is... is teal open?
10no
4I don't think so
4lol
10lol
For example, if you go to a blind date show, you hear certain pieces of information about 3 different people, now, you don't have all the information on each person, and you have to come to a logical conclusion, well, the logical conclusion on the information given might be to choose person A, for one person, but it may be person B for another, so it is your opinion on the given data, thus making the logic opinion
4niether is red -.-
6Neither is purple >: D
4how many people are doing the red text color?
How anyone could argue MY logic there, I don't get.
4logic is based around human opinions lol
10its not opinionated, some just interpret it differently
Yet he argued for THREE hours.
14Heh
4I AM
4Red be my color :D
4that all
Yes, but it is your opinion on the given data.
4alright lets try
4I banish everyone from the color red
4...
How you interpret it, is you opinion on the data.
12Blue?
10There is only one truely logical choice. To you everyone elses is illogical.
4blue is good
6I can agree with that, Dari
12not taken?
There is only one logical choice in a situation where you have all the data.
10On second thoughts I retract my opinion.
10Logic is opinionated
4Human logic I believe is based around your own personal opinions....and your own personal experiences...how you interpret something and the right way to deal with it is having logic about something...so thus you must have personal experiences to asertain the appropriate logic to deal with a situation
/me 14hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "babe" and "gal"
He seemed to think, that in situations where you do not have all the data, you have an opinion the data that is given, and create the rest of the data from that, meaning that there is only one logical answer.
10personal motives also play a part so it is therefore opinionated and specific to each person
Yet it is your opinion on the given data, so your opinion equates to the logical answer, really.
10there's mathamatical logic and human logic
10human logic is opinion, mathamatical is statistical
12stop making smart
4why? lol
10I cant help it

Blaze: Banned.
Blaze: I think SR would ban you.
/me 14crosses her fingers
4I think I'll go get him
Hmm...
10you know that children crave attention right?
10by speaking to it you're only encouraging it
A retard, as you put it, someone who has been born mentally ill.
4hm
The word gay, which you seem to think is an insult, is the word for someone who is a homosexual.
12your a homo
4that's not the insulting term at all
14....wow
4and you're going to be banned
Should you retain these facts, I shall be greatly surprised, as you are an idiot to the extreme.
12warning the folowing program thinks youe a homo
/me 14is amazed at how immature Blaze is being
6Oh, and gay also means "Happy", so therefor YOU are stupid

Then changed your text colour to white.
4true
Then continued to spam.
14he insulted gays and "retards"
4then kept going with the retard stuff
13...
Ooohhh,
13Blaze: Why insult gay people?
Heheheh.
12for god sake i said i did things wrong do you want me to dance in my underwear or something?
Yes.

Homo means one in Ancient Greek*

14I'm not going to forgive him. He has to earn it.

He can't earn it, every time he speaks (types), his terrible spelling and grammar drives him further down.
4no need to
10Right, if Im not gone in the next 25 minutes someone shout at me

14Blaze: I'm not forgiving you. You have to earn it.

14And right now, you are very far from earning it
Not right now. why?
15im sorry i will try to earn but how?
10lol that's good, I like it
13Blaze: You did not "practically bow to everyone's feet". You insulted me and harassed these members. Saying you're sorry without meaning it is nothing.
14Figure it out for yourself.

damn...hate it when that happens
Lol

Debate.
There's a difference.
That was about Arabs and Isaelis.

4we were just looking for a topic to debate Dari lol
4and you are usually pretty good at finding those lol
My underwear is too tight =O
10Would you be called on in case of war?
10What's IT'd?
10I think this thing keeps freezing on me
4Yes I would be called upon
4I can be called on any day
4and IT means Intensive Training
understood*
13lol
4because of the Cuban missle crisis lol
4well unfortuntely all that runs through the UN
4so if Europe has a problem with it then say something lol
UK isn't part of Europe.
:P
10We have, but youve already got permission lol
10YES IT IS!!!
Nah.
10It damn well is
4he said Europe lol
4not Uk
We don't use the Euro.
10AND?!!
Europe sucks.
The UN sucks.
They put us through stupid regulations.
10We're still apart of Europe, and you call yourself English
We are better off by ourselves.
10hmph
4haha
inferior human organs!
4good luck with that
And they take everything out of our hands.
4England being an island nation
4where the hell you gonna get your resources from lol
10New Zealond
4which pretty much all run through the UN lol
10land*
10Ah, but the UN isnt the EU
4nah
4Dari took his color lol
Kill Blair.
4If you ruin your relationship with the nations around you who is gonna deal with you lol
Made us sign that stupid treaty.
:/
10Isnt that what your country has basically done?
I don't want Europian ties.
4lol
4Blair was freaking stupid....
10and a kiss up
He was Bushes poodle. :/
10lol true
4and which country were you talking about
10Brown isnt that much better either
Someone has to be pretty stupid to be the pet of Bush.
10Or just a really really big kiss up
4I'm not in the mood to deal with freaking Bush bashing right now
10he followed him to Iraq for gods sake
14Oh
14Nevermind
/me burns the treaty of Lisbon.
Piece of crap.
/me burns Blair.
4doesn't matter since our economy is not going to be royally fucked for the next 50 years
4and I get to help pay for it...yay
10We'll all get to help pay for it
4well at least I'm not in the freaking stock market lol
10true lol
Hahaha.
4those poor bastards will be jumping out of windows again
10dont want another wallstreet
Yeah.
Loooool.
God.
4that's why you don't put money where you can't see it
So you don't put money in the bank either? :P
Oh wait.
O_o
10cant see your money in a bank....
4okay my bad....don't invest your money in something you can't see is that better lol
10lol yes
4if you want to handle money right
10I earn 1% on my money in the bank
4use one bank....one debit card....and deal all in cash
Buy gold with your money.
Gold is always going up in price.
4and gold is actually a good idea
4that shit is going up
10for now
10but it is a safe investment
4I don't invest in anything
4I keep my money where I can see it lol.....and keep it safe by my own means
10I used to keep mine in my safe...now its in the bank earning me 1p a month
4freaking credit cards lol
4and people wonder why they are in debt
10i use debit cards
4I use one debit card
4that's it
10well yeah, one debit card
First they want to build a missile base, but it won't stop there.
13...
4pssst go talk to Obama lol
4he already promised everything and can't deliever...I'm sure he would be glad to help lol
Then they'll start building army bases around the UK
10He'll be assassinated soon
Then when they have enough people, they'll take over completely.
4his approval rating is already sinking like a stone lol
How long do you think before he gets assassinated?
4well
10before the end of his first term
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TiQCJXpbKg
13blah.
4seeing as how I'm a member of the military that's not something I can really talk about
Lol.
3If obama is assassinated....
3then there will be riots....complete and total hell
10doubtful
Rioting against what?
4The world is going to end up like that anyways
I don't think so.
13brb
4and yeah I doubt anything big would happen
My last message wasn't aimed at you, by the way, RDX.
10I'm moving to the moon, no one owns that yet, no taxes
4In terms of how we meet our end.....if the world erupts into a freaking explosion of anger because of our own selfish needs....hence WW3 would erupt...which means complete breakdown of society since we would pretty much kill everyone anyways...
4what do you think people would do? lol
I'm going to hide undergruond?
underground*
4well I can just see the entire world going nuts if Necleur holocaust is upon us
4"nuclear"
10It wont come to that
4however you spell it
10none of us are that stupid
4not us
4but you have no idea how many stupid people are in this world
10it'd be mass suicide
4any of them would love to launch a nuke just for the fuck of it
10on a global scale
4this world is already at risk of that
13back
4everyone has nukes now
4all it takes is one little push
13bah
10wouldnt do them any good though, a nuke is only good if it can get you something
4and who knows what could happen
Nukes are such a bad idea. :/
Why does anyone need a weapon so powerful?
10They're unusable weapons
4You know their are people who really are sick enough to want that shit lol
4well let's go back to WW2 lol
3weapons of mass destruction are threats
4we wanted to end the war quickly and let the Japanese know that we could kill them at any time
4and they ended it pretty quickly
4now everyone has access to them now lol
10two bombs was a bit unnecessery though
4Dari go watch the movie Crimson Tide
4it was global war FB
FB>
FB?*
4the definition of total war is to use every single resource at your disposal to kill the enemy
10But still, one bomb would have got the job done
10you werent trying to wipe them out
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ysQE9MKaz0 these girls have no lives. Oh well.
4and maybe one freaking ship destroyed at pearl harbor could have told us to back off?
4they wanted the war over
4they didn't take any chances
10And wiping out one city in one second is different to one ship in several minutes
At least Obama has said that Guantanimo bay is going to be shut down.
One good thing at least.
4They wanted to end the war and they made their point...arguing about why they dropped two is pretty pointless. They wanted to get the point across
4shutting down Gittmo is a bad idea
4unless they find a place for all these prisoners
Holding people who they only suspect are terrorists is wrong.
4which they have yet to do
10I know, its pointless to debate now, that's just my opinion on the matter
Holding people who they only suspect are terrorists is wrong.
10open up alcatraz
They don't even get a trial.
4more then the vast majority of people in that prison have been involved in terrorist acts...or suspected of it yet refuse to talk
4but we don't have a place to put them
It's disgusting.
4it's disgusting that we are trying to defend against the overall threat of terrorism by seizing those who refuse to talk?
And locking up for life? Yes.
4if they refuse to talk then they just might know something
You don't know if they've done anything.
So?
4and that's enough to put them in the risk factor
That's life, there's always risks.
4and yet they might have
4so it can go either way
4but if they suspect someone
Sounds about right.
4any nation will do that if they get the chance
Hah.
That's going extreme. They might as well lock everyone up, everyone is always a risk.
10I believe this topic is starting to border on the line of offence here
There's a risk they might go off shooting people
4Every time you need a fall back you go onto nations as a whole
4every freaking person in that prison has been a suspect
It's not a fall back.
4they are in the risk facotr
4'factor"
4they might know something
4and they wont talk
Everyone is a risk.
You can't just lock them up.
4so we are right to assume that they do
No you aren't.
4that's a risk we will gladly take
You shouldn't lock people up without fair trial.
4and I don't care so much about closing the prison
4the problem is
4they don't know what to do with them
3wow...
10what if they dont actually know anything?
4and they have yet to give a response
They should release them.
Most are innocent.
4ummm no
Uhh, yes.
;)
4um no
4that's freaking insane
10what if they dont actually know anything?
4I don't know where you get this innocent shit....most of them are all freaking guilty
4and in the end it doesn't matter because guess what
They have not been proven guilty.
4everyone in the world complains that we dont' care
4when we do do something
4everyone complains that we are murderers
4and pretty much most of the time we poke our noses because someone complains about it first
4and we were attacked first
10But thats the role your nation has claimed on itself, there;s no point in sitting here arguing about things that us as individuals can not and never will change
Hah.
4these facotors are far out of our hands
You go into countries that don't want you there.
4goverments are governments
4we go into countries that would sooner harm those around them then help people
But the fact that you support that BS makes me angry.
10To put it simply every country is ruled by an indiot, can we at least agree on that?
4and the fact you are a freaking la la liberal that can't see the truth in matters makes me angry
I suppose.
4so what have we proved?
It isn't the truth.
4yes it is
10none of us have proved anything except for the fact we cant remove ourselves from the argument
4just like the fucking Israelis and Arabs lol
4and you can't see it because you are so hell bent on "proof"
4I would rather see that then have them free and then do something which is a huge possibility
How can you expect me to think that to be right.
4it was their fault for not talking in the first place
They aren't given a trial.
Where is their chance to talk.
10How can you telll the diffeence between the ones that dont talk and the ones that dont know anything?
They just lock them up, because they suspect them.
4if they don't talk what do you think we will do?
4we can't just let you go
4we found you engaging in activities that could harm this country
4we have eevery right to detain you
4we have every right to suspect them. If they don't talk that gives us every right to assume that they know something we don't and that puts them in the risk facotr
They have no right to be there.
4we are there for a reason which I said earlier
4the Cuban Crisis has forced us to keep a presence there
4and how do you know there are not terrorists there?
10I think communisim isnt all that bad
4there are terrorists in every single country
4and many of them would be glad to freaking launch a nuke to display their ideals
10I still doubt that
10scare maybe but never use
4do you not see how sick some people are today?
4and we are not suppose to be?
4okay
4so we sit here
4do nothing abotu it
4then when they do attack us
4it's okay to do something
4but wait...we do
4then the world calls us murderes again
4for actually trying to act upon it
4then the whole thing starts all over again
4Terrorists attack everywhere...and I'm sorry if the whole 9-11 thing doesn't sit well with me
And by going into Iraq, they just made more terrorists for themselves to be attacked by.
9-11 was a while ago.
4The terrorists were always going to be there...they are operating on a global scale
4they attacked the towers twice
4and succeeded the second time by far
4and ever since 9-11 there have been no attacks on us
Exactly.
4because we have stepped up the fight against them
Yes.
4and that's where it matters
4because we keep our people safe
Well done.
10THIS IS GETTING TIRESOME, NEITHER OF YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS SO WHY ARGUE, IT'S BLOODY POINTLESS!!!!
4and through various other reasons
Not more in one year than died in Iraq.
4this isn't even a war
4it's a police action
4and yes more in one year
4would you like the figures?
Fine.
4on average
http://www.antiwar.com/casualties/
4casualties and deaths are completely different
4car accidents are just the largest one
4and that's each year
Terrorists being one of the smallest.
4but the ones that shouldn't happen
I think its mainly that they like going trigger happy and killing people they assume are terrorists.
4because we did nothing wrong to die over fanatical religious beliefs
Finally....
4because we have no right to protect our country right?
4oh yeah I forgot we are not suppose to do anything
4nevermind
4and I am aware of you lol
4sorry
They wouldn't.
4did I not just say religious beliefs?
4ummmm terrorists hate us
4and you know what the vast majority of them yell before they die
4ALLLLLAAAHHHHHH!!!!!
4then they blow themeslves up
4good for fucking you
4you get 72 virgins for blowing yourslef up
4and going to see Allah
4and taking innocents with you
4thats what they are brought up to believe
4that killing yourself in the name of Allah is the greatest glory you can ever have
3....
3talk about your heated debates
4and they want to install fear in our nation by taking innocents with them
4that's the whole point of terrorism
4they want us to fear them
4and not do anything against them
That's what the terrorists hate most.
4so you are saying if we just sat here and did nothing that terrorists would no longer attac k
4you are just as blind as Raidon lol
They wouldn't have reason to.
3I don't know why...but I have to randomly insert myself into the conversation
4mister freaking "if we sit here we will be out of Nuclear war'
4what a freakign moron
They wouldn't.
10what is it the terrorists actually want?
warm
4Terrorists want to install their radical beliefs in others through fear
4They were recrutinga anyways...and they always would have!
4they attacked the towers two times
4the first for no reason at all
4the second because they wanted to fucking send a statement that we were a disease that doesn't deserve to live
They wouldn't have had so many recruits.
10I cant cope with any religion whatsoever....appart from maybe budahisim
4The Terrorists would still be recruting no matter what...and they would still be attacking
4they proved that when they attacked us for no reason whatsoever
BS, how do you know thart?
4the important factor here is they are over there
4BECAUSE OSAME BIN LADIN SAID IT HIMSELF
4TURN ON THE NEWS ONCE IN AWHILE
4Our country got involved with others why?
4because they wanted us to
10Osama hasnt been in the news for quite a while
4it started in fucking WW1
I expect that there was a reason for the 9/11. (Obviously I don't mean a justified reason, I mean a reason in the eyes of the terrorists)
4and ever since then people have wanted us to bail them out
3-.-
10I grow tired of this, goodbye
3....
Nope.
BS.
4oh then genius what is it
4seeing as how their leader SAID that
4please enlighten me
Or you twisted what their leader said.
4the whole freaking world heard it
4he televised it
4and they have it written out
Get me an exact quote.
http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/frontpage/seattle_pima1x220041030.pdf
Exactly what I said
Osama Bin Laden saying that if no one messes with them, they won't attack them.
4"we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy, who would be killed based on the position of the tower. We calculated that the floors that would be hit would be three or four floors. I was the most optimistic of them all...We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day. We had finished our work that day and had the radio on...Muhammad (Atta) from the Egyptian family (meaning t
4and that claims right there that they are more then willing to die for their religious beliefs
from the Egyptian family (meaning t
Cut off there
Your security is not in the hands of Kerry,
Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own
hands, bin Laden said. Any state that does
not mess with our security has naturally guaranteed
its own security.
4shit
4that goes back to yesterday
Your security is not in the hands of Kerry,
Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own
hands, bin Laden said. Any state that does
not mess with our security has naturally guaranteed
its own security.
Oops
Admitting for the first time that he ordered
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, bin Laden said he
did so because of injustices against the Lebanese
and Palestinians by Israel and the United
States.
4wtf
1,8New Topic Alert:2 "is there any animated characters you have a crush on?" by cynder401, http://www.spyroforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=8722
4which claims what I was saying yesterday to be true
They don't like that, they attack.
4They blamed us for the interference when it was in there hands to begin with
How?
4they didn't accept the deal
What deal?
4they had a chance to make peace
Yes, but they shouldn't have had to accept that deal.
13back.
It's all their own land.
4the deal that seperated Isreal into two states...giving Jersusalem to both halfs
It is their land.
4btw Jordon and Palestine were not nations before that
4they were just nomadic territories under British Jurisdiction
13Are you freaking kidding me....? STILL?
He organised 9/11 because he didn't like what the US was doing.
As I said.
If they keep out of it, they won't get attacked.
4So he didn't like it because we played a part that was only our part....becasue we gave the Jews a piece of land they refuse to yield as always
4so in turn they attack us because we just happen to be the bad guys
4they could just as much blame you for it
4or the Jews
4or freaking French for all they care
13:/
...
4they fear us the most
4that's what the point of terrorism is
13ugh
4to install fear in your enemy through hostlie means
4we interfere because people complain when we don't!
4again back to the beginning of ww!
No they don't.
4WW1
Who has complained?
4and WW2
4And dessert Strom
13..............-_____________________-
4well let's see
4WW1
4the French
4the British
4The Russians
They needed your help.
4exactly
4and we gave it to them
4we "interfered"
4this is WW1
4not WW2
Whatever.
4And guess what
4did you know
4that the British
They asked for help.
4know about the attack on pearl harbor?
The Iraqis didn't ask for help.
Yes.
My mom is a bitch
4and they let it happen
4to get us in the war
4because they would have been overwhelmed if we hadn't
So?
4so you claim we interefere in everything
What has that got to do with anything?
4when most of the time we are either pulled into it or they complain if we dont
You only intefere when people don't want you to.
4you were the one just making a big deal over it
When people to, you don't do anything.
Sit back and watch the fireworks.
4Well Osama also admited that he had ties to Iraq
4so that gave us every reason to go in there
4that and Saddam was fucking nuts
4don't know how people miss that one
BS, most of the terrorists weren't in Iraq.
4his sons were nuts
4then why did Osama admit his ties to it?
So they could control what was going on there.
I don't know, tactics?
4the low and behold we removed him
4and his nutcase sons
4and we still get blamed for it
4they have a free democracy now
4that's what we gave them
These girls are ace. And their racoon is ace.
4what they do with it now is their own business
4and that was not reason enough to go in there?
4that was a different presidency
It was because it didn't bother them.
13Quuuuuuiiiiiiiit Biiiiiiickerrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiinnnngggg
4wow I needed that lol
Lawl
Heheheheh.
13*cries*
I think it's pretty safe to say we won't ever agree on this, LOL.
4so long as their is division their will be no agreement
4we can go around and around for hours
4in the end who really is to blame?
4does it really matter
13Don't start up again

Nah, suppose not.

Now back to the animators site
An Animator should be able to bring life to any object or character, showing the character’s internal thoughts and feelings through its physical external motion. To do this, the Animator must be a good actor.
It says moer but that is just the start
Lol
Drama is pointless. :P
13I used to take "play" classes for like musicals and stuff...
13I was never in a big one because I never wanted to be but we had little performances...

Anyone know the alt code for the backwards question mark?
4Yes.
You don't, do you?
4alt + F4

4:P
7alt + 666 (not really, but I'm curious what it'd do))
7Ü
7Lol
7♪ <--- alt + 13
Found it.
4It does nothing.




It does block for me
7Meh
Oh right, that's just 666, I did 0666
7Lol
7Idiot.
7try alt + 8658
Most alt codes begin with 0
7Ê 8658
4Jurisdiction!
Because after alt code 0288, they just start repeating themselves again.
7Lol
~Ok
Sec.
7so alt 01 = alt 0289?
No
Yeah.
7Lol
7alt 01 does nothing
Oh wait
Alt codes start at alt 032
13Alt codes don't work for me...*cries*
Alt codes start at alt 0032
7so alt 032 = alt 0289?
4kek
13N3ON: What?
No, because all except that first alt code repeats.
7No, alt 032 = alt 0288. :P
Oh wait.
4O NOTHING
Yeah.
So.
7Doesn't matter now lol
after 0287 they repeat
7I PROVED U RONG! I R TEH CHAMPEEUN!

Well done.

XD
7Greatest simpsons episde ebur.
Can't beat the classics.
7Nope
lol
Some of the new ones suck.
7Unless they're the OLD ones, the "LET'S ALL GO OUT FOR FROSTY CHAWCOLATE MILKSHAKES!" ones.
Actually, most of them do.
I like the old ones
season 2 is really good.
7Meh.
They actually have good writing in the old ones
Season 2,3,4,5,6 are the best
7I think we only ever got Season 3 over here, Sky probably decided the old ones weren't good enough graphics or something.
7Season 3 and up*
7I think that's what I ready somewhere anyway.
there is rarely any season 2s on tv
[14:19] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: did you hear i might be coming back.
I noticed that
[14:20] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: well arent you just the greatest person in the world.
[14:20] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: why are you being mean?
7Once, and this actually happened, the Simpsons insulted Fox News pretty badly, and Fox News was planning to sue the Simpsons, until they realised The Simpsons is OWNED by fox.
[14:22] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: just to talk holy, thought it might be nice to talk to you since i havent in a year or two
13Haha SR
7I could think of some ways
7Unless we're talking on something we both agree on lol.
Some fugly annoying chick that I knew in like grade 6 likes to tell me how shes moving back to BC...
13LOLOL fugly
[14:24] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: still in Hartland New Brunswick
Hahaha I just made myself laugh
remembering what I said to this chick in grade 6
[14:25] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: "might" be moving back, and its not a shit hole, its just, very...very...Oh fuck okay whatever its a shit hole
7What did you say in grade 6? Because I know you're itching to tell us :P
One day I told her she should be a lesbian because no guys would ever date her, then she told me she had a crush on me until I said that and that she hates me now. That was in grade 6.
super
7That was an epic win.
So I pretty much killed 2 birds with one stone so to speak.
I (a) insulted her, and (b) made sure she would never like me again
13wow
13haha that's mean
but (b) is sort of failing because im irresistible even though im a jerk.
13XDDDD
13brb/bbl
[14:29] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: which reminds me, are you gay?
[14:31] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: are you being sarcastic with me?
[14:32] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: HEY! no need to get personal! didnt mean to piss yeah off! gosh, you sure can be mean
You're watching the Family Learning Channel. And now, angry tics fly out of my nipples!
[14:36] {J}acqueline- [see you soon]: there are three ways i can answer that, one is to Agree with you, but then you might come back with a mean joke or get mad. Two i could not answer and then you would get mad or just not say anything else, OR three disagree and then say something or get mad, like #1. whcih one should i choose,

But only certain people's matter, such as mine.

10no, I dont understand what you are saying
13"Don't you understand pig latin?"
13:P
Heheheh
10I figured it was that and no, I dont
It doesn't really work with punctuation at the moment though
10I know, It just takes me a while to work it out
Hmm
Let me see if this works.
Someone speak.
13rawr
Meh

Hello, I live in a hat made of cheese
Lawl
Win
Spyro is made out of either sponge or marshmellow, just try to argue with me
Now what happens if I turn both spam scripts on?
/me turns the other one on
/set %rev 1
Someone speak, lawl
Agado do do push pineapple shake a tree
Lawl
Now to make a 12 year old AOLer spam script.
good.. bad.. I'm the bot with the gun^@@%!%~#$$@$
^!%@^***$@$#*
...
ok then
That's pretty annoying
Yup
I was serious about Spyro being made out of either sponge or marshmellow by the way
Well it explains why water kills him
But his own fire would burn him if he was,
Nah, fire retardant sponge
It also explains why he can charge into walls without a scratch
He's a sponge I tell you, a sponge!!!
oh great you going off about the marshmellow theory already lol
Hm
or sponge theory
Oh yes
sponge/marshmellow theory
as crazy as it sounds it does make sense lol
I have a cake/caek theory...
It cant compare to my sponge.marshmello theory, mine is airtight
It isn't about Spyro. :P
Then whats it about?
Cake/Caek
I dont understand
Let me find it.
...cake isnt an atom
I know.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I made it an atom.
Lawl.
therefore it makes no sense
lol
I know you can't make atoms.
It's not meant to.
I can't stop eee-ing
That's why it's MY theory.
Because it makes no sense what so ever.
Shameful, at least MY theory makes sense lol
Mine isn't meant to.
Therefore it is made of win,.
Light doesnt exist in atoms...
Did you miss where I said it's not supposed to make sense?
hm
...I cant grasp things that make no sense...
No one should be able to grasp it.
The point is that no one understand it.
mmmmm breasts
O_o
a single atom of cake cant undergo fission
Well as mentioned earlier, you can't have an atom of cake.
...I'll stop now
what the heck were you debating about? lol
...I...have...no idea
oh.....well that's one of Dari's threories then lol
omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
I sense that things are a little slow tonight
NU UUUUUUH!
goes back and forth lol
Someone speak.
MWAHAAHAHAHA
Hi

Meh.

Helloo?
Oops

Hey guys, how you doing?
Pika.

Terminator: Excuse me waiter, but there's a Pichu in my soup
sorry about being an annoying jackass earlier
Hmm
well just don't say stupid stuff and you wont get booted lol
0.o
that was wier
"wierd"
My 12 year old AOLer spamming machine is taking shape
Dari and his little scripts
I take it I was missing when this stupid stuff was said
AHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
heh
The taste of human annihilation grows stronger in my amazing head.
=)
hm
yes
back
Ahahahahaha.
It's looking more like a 12 year old AOLer all the time.
Where's the orange?
Hmm
the to teh.
Good idea
What else...
How can I make it remove all punctuation...
Add at least 5 exclamation marks after each sentence
Ok
Yeah, that's really annoying
Lawl
what is the point in that?
Hmm
That to tht
the to teh
Ho ho.
Wtf?
Lawl
He's using a spamming machine
GAH!

Hey

...
Obvious much?
Not really
It's not, don't worry
:P
Ok. :P
but, then again, I'm easily annoyed
hm
I'll bbl
SPYRO IS A MARSHMELLOW!!!
wth
hmmm
what is with everyone....
what?
there is nothing wrong with everyone here lol
......
Only you, being so easily annoyed
Really? I think we all get slightly less sane each time we come on here
what's wrong with what FB said lol
I SPEAK NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
You're talking to the wrong person about sanity...
He's a marshmellow I tell you
How did you come to that conclusion
AHA someone's actually got me to explain why. Give me a sec to collaborate my thoughts
I have actually taken to eathing miniature marshmellows
Hmm
You see, he doesnt get hurt when falling off buildings and charging into walls. Therefore he is made out of marshmellow because that would absorb the impact of the fall or charge. Sparx is there to stop him from being punctured by sharp objects and when a marshmellow gets wet it gets a slimy coating, giving Spyro the appearence of wet scales
Have to hve
You're eating Spyro's babies!!!
oh lord....
AHHH
XD
Try to proove me wrong, I dares ya
When he gets squashed he pops back into shape, just like what? A marshmellow
......thats only in the Original Series
Keep going with your point
In the Legend of Spyro series, he isn't a marshmellow
And why not?
Hm
:P

8 in general, but starting recently, and it's stopped kicking now.
I'd like a show of hands of who agrees with me please
yeah I don't see why not lol....it really doesn't matter to me in the end because it's an imaginary character lol..and my reasoning is that he was "dent proof" because the developers wished him so lol
/me raises his hand

Pig latin?
Hi there Cactus :)
Yeah...
Hi
I have 3 different settings
One that reverses everything you say.
One that changes it to pig latin
holy lag
I thought your scripts weren't allowed in here?
And one that changes it into 12 year old AOLer language.
It isn't a script.
>.>
It's a button on a menu.
o_o
Pff, like I know the difference =P
Script... bot... whatever it is
And technically, SR said I wasn't allowed bots...
He never said I couldn't have the odd user script. O_O
I don't care
Lawl. :P
He never told me the rule, so I couldn't do anything even if I wanted to
It's true, you cant deny it
You know you're just going to get a bunch of little kids whining at you for insulting Cynder
I don't.
besides the kids should be happy, she's more huggable now
:P
Hmm...What a good idea.
Oh crap
That can't be good
D:
Turn all no's into nuuu's, is, into ish, and not into nawt
ZOMG! DID U SAY CYNDAR??!?!1?!!!!!11??!?!?!!??7!?
Hahahaha
....the kids will be happy, I'm almost certain
Do it
...
Verrrry perceptive.
Terminator: Loooooooooooooooooooool
Even the bots have me sussed out.
Wow.
If I had one of those things that stored funny quotes, that would be in it.
:D
Of course now I need to think up strong defenses for my theory for one someone tries to dispute it
Yeah, I'll put it in. :P
They're talkibg about Twilight on TV! HIDE THE KIDS!!!
*talking
OMG TWILIGHT

D:
*destroys
EDWARD WILL NEVAR LUFF MEH NAO!!111 :(
I fail tonight.
I was just pointing out that I'm pretty sure the developers made it that way because they didn't want him to take damage from falls lol......anything we assume is just our imaginations filling in gaps
hahah, OK, enough of this :P
Heh
...we all know that the developers did it...but where's the fun in that?
Actually, I control the developers, so I did it.
The fun is a lie.

"peace.love.edward: i love you edward:$"
I need more crackpot theories...hmmm....I'll get started on them right away
OMIGOSH KAWAIIII!!!11
Example?
Eurgh, no, I don't think I could handle that.
Haha
What hasn't been explained in the Spyro universe?
Why Cynder has such an annoying fanbase
Lol
Who knows...
because most are freaking little kids who don't know better
Lol turns to "lululul", lol.
...
Uhh
/me draws a picture of Edward Cullen "anime style" and burns it
Guess that's explained then
at least that's what I think lol
OK, I got one
Because I say so, and I own you all
Why does Malefor want to blow up the world, and why does Spyro doing a fury put it back together?
I STILL have to work on that comic...
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lol+theory
I'll get started on it straight away, I will come up with an explanation!!!
Because by blowing up the world, you make a new world
(yeah, I watched some of the cutscenes from DotD because I can't be bothered to waste my money one the game)
However that works
in the game didn't he say that the true role of the purple dragon was to bring about the great cleasing of the world?
...The one where I show how messed up the ending to DotD is
/me doesn't own DotD yet.
Hey SR
Hey
You're making a comic of that?
Awesome
psstt....this would be one of those times where Zero would freaking be usefull
Zero?
zero
?
Zerodius
Uh huh
I know of Zero, but I dont know her
Her?
...What?
a freaking fanfiction writer who is absolutely nuts with coming up with theories on these games
Zerodius is a girl?
and she it's a she
I think I'll have to draw it on paper and then remake it on Photoshop...
Wow
I never knew that
I think it's all she does with her life
gah....she even drives me nuts
I think me and Zero could come up with some very interesting theories to the inconsistances in the Spyro univers
Haha, you should meet Serge165
Hmm, also I think I'll change really to ORLY
when will the lies end?!
Oh no...
I'm sure you guys could
not serge...
If you think Zerodius is bad....
Zerodius is a chick?
Nothing compared to Serge
You have not been through the vast majority of Zero's stuff lol
one time I at there for 5 freaking hours...while she ranted on about how all these games were linked
He would go on and on about his Spyro theories to me for hours
She wont post on it
/me hates the terms "dude" "dudet" "chick" "gal" and "babe"
On MSN
D:
why not?
She get's me on gmail -.-
Serge makes up songs about spyro characters and will type them to you over msn.
because she doesn't post on the forum much anymore
LOL
...
and she is under a different name now
shame
And he keeps sending me "<3" and meowing at me
Hahaha
...
/me twitches
she is afraid that her ideas will be rediculed too much lol
WTH?
I disabled Messenger
Because it kept signing me in randomly and he would contact me
Lol
Wow, this is REALLY annoying
I'm just glad John isn't screwed up with her anymore
...
Orly annoying?
lol'
Yes.
ARGH!
Oh come on
=/
OK, this is starting to get old
Wow
Turn it off now plz
Fine, :P
John wont post on the forum lol
I'll make him
See, you're scaring Terminator
he doesn't have time to man lol
I'll make him find time
heck I don't even see him much now
On 24 they have Mac computers that run Vista.
me nietehr but I'll find him eventually
the most we talked for this whole week was five minutes
usually on msn
well...I don't have MSN
kek
he is prolly on there more
Hai
He roleplays on MSN from time to time
...
O_o
Eew roleplaying
he is still doing the roleplaying?
I hate roleplaying
with someone else
jeez I thought he was done with that
At least I think he does
who?
he never did change his name back
well his name hasn't changed on gmail either
That was another annoying thing about MSN, this other guy always asked me to RP
I dont know who, he never said
still that.........yeaaaah
No, his gamail is the same, but on MSN it changed
not like he needs it now due to the recent events
I'm going to a friend's 16th birthday party on saturday, what should I get her?
true lol
depends on the girl
Im going to an 18th what do I get him?!!!!
I dunno, a stripper?
Lawl
I'm terrible at buying gifts for people
:P
Hahaha what?
I could tell you if I knew what kind of person they are lol
lol then whats a safe gift?
A gift card?
Money?
18th for a guy or girl?
guy
Yeah, go with a gift card
Money is no fun, gift cards suck
Or cash
well gift cards do always work lol
Cards = fuck-coin.
Everyone loves cash
do you have any idea what he likes?
=/
=/
=/
I don't know
I haven't seen her for 3 years
well we havent been able to talk for months so no, not anymore, I think money is my safest bet
hm
SR has so much money, that getting it for his birthday doesn't interest him, LOL
well it certainly doesn't help if it's for people you have not seen or talked to in months/years lol
you guys are screwed lol
lol true
so just go with money
I probably am
and a nice card
Haha, I never have this problem
or just get her something id like.
lol
No one likes me IRL =P
Thats what I usually do.
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-259949.html#259949
I'll give him mney....and a particularly 18th related birthday card
why wouldn't anybody like you in real life :P
<insert smart ass comment here>
Thanks a lot =/
I usually just buy people stuff that I like
hm
because I like cool things.
well you can always go with something involving technology lol....if you feel like spending money
Has it been explained why there is only one purple dragon every 10 generations?
gah................no
Right then, I'll explain that to
o
does it matter? lol
..........
>_>
No, but its another excuse for an insane theory
Nothing matters/
/me backs away into a corner
Nothiiiiiiing
I wont lol
then go make a topic on it or something lol
The best kind of explanations.
I will, once I have a theory
well good luck with that one
Im thinking colour preservatives need to be mixed in the right order, thats why a purple dragon wouldnt make a purple dragon egg
...
it has to be the right combonations of red,blues, blacks etc etc etc
.....
...huh?
hmm, maybe not
just so you know lol......they don't really want to hear the theories on here :P
I reckon that Spyro lives in Narnia, and that the 10 generations is the time between each game, as time passes differently there than here.
I'll refreain from posting them until I have undeniable evidence then
I forgot she just created one
Lawl
Spyro is a purple dragon. Purple dragons form regardless of parents, as it is only once every ten genreations.
I have one...terrible terrible pictures on it, I hate it when people post pictures of me!!
I would have been at school then
At least, that's what I think. Holy crap, I though tof something
I have one lol...that I never really go on
But there must be a reason!
And facebook is blocked at school
Yeah, I don't use it either
no real need to
It's kind of useless
I have facebook
I see my IRL friends every day at school anyway
But they wouldnt let me use my real name
you have a faceboo? lol
!AOL lol just testing to see if everything is working as it should, although I expect it is, I'm working on making it even more accurate, heheheh. That's good though, right?
!AOL LULULUL JUST TESTNG TO SEE IF EVERYTHNG ISH WORKNG AS IT SHOULD, ALTHOUGH I EXPECT IT IS, IM WORKNG ON MAKNG IT EVEN MORE ACCURATE, HEHEHEH.!!!!!!! THTS GOOD THOUGH, RIGHT?
all but 5 people on my friend list are really my friends lol
/me wonders if she should ignore all of SR's comments after the last one
most of mine are family...
/me thinks she should
well I know them from school...but I have a big difference between a friend and an aquaintance in my mind
I have 30 "friends"
I prefer to make aquaintances, no loyalty then lol or responsibilities
I have maybe 5 true friends
But they just add me so they can seem like they're cool and have more friends
Hah
You're lucky
About the same here, maybe 3
I /thought/ I had one. Maybe two
3 here as well
Well....two of them are online lol
D:
and three in real life
just people who I know will always help me no matter what
I'm kool i has lots of msn contacts
well if I include internet it goes up to 6
SR: Fine
Yowza
mine climbs to 7...
Yeah, I know you did =P
You're on my friends list now
Yay
I have 192 friends :/
I don't use any social networking sites.
Lol.
I stay away from facebook, I dont like the pictures people put of me on it
/me pushes her spectacles down her nose and peers at RedDrahonX
why are you peering at me? lol
Meh, I'n bored.
/me peers some more
0.o
I'm*
I think I'll check my facebook now lol...
no peering
What?
Oh, sorry.
Quite alright
hm...

/me is bored
Homecoming
I've never been to prom

I went to my prom...reluctantly
No point in going without a date
/me gets into a crouching position and crawls around the room
Well tough, it causes brain damage
oh
well I was somewhat close :P
:P
Easily, my school did them, I did say I reluctantly went
/me removes the blindfold
/me shakes her head and starts searching for a light
You smoke?

No, it was just a really bad pun.
gah...I can't stand smokers...
Same.
/me gives the 'What I do?' face
and compulsive drinkers
I drink...on occasion...like 18th birthday parties
I don't drink
I never get drunk though
/me defends himself with the power of the marshmellow
/me stares back
/me wears glasses
Fail
Such and epic, epic fail\
/me blinks
/me punches the air in triumph
/me does a barrel role
/me sighs
Why don't we just declare a truce?
That's fine by me
After all, mah boi, peace is what all great warriors strive for.
That is true, that and glory of course
/me waits.
here, you can have this
...
o.o
*coughglassescough*
/me will simply find another desk
Fair trade?
I already have glasses
Now you have two pairs
/me watches
*COUGHGLASSESCOUGH*
/me puts on lensless glasses to fit in
/me hugs her beloved glasses, accidentally breaking them
...
/me fixes them for her and gives them back
...you could trade his desk for his glasses instead
if he hadnt already fixed them....
lol
So...I'm the only one with 20/20 vision?
my vision sucks
my vision sucks more than anyone here
mine can see through walls
the Navy said it was some of the worse they had ever seen lol
Get some new eyes
eh
I'll get laser eye surgury sometime in the future
I'd just go for a brand new set
I look hideous without my glasses
...Thats what the blindfold was for...
/me stares at both of them and backs away
idk where Dave has disappeard to
one of the Spyro writers
I brought him on here as well
...oh, I heard of him...he asked me to read his stories...I forgot to
well...my guess is that he is pretty much focused on his new online girlfriend
/me places a Golden Cap on her head and stands on her left foot.
Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!
/me stands on her right foot
Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!
/me stands on both feet.
Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!

*He-Man.
I guess
OH WHATEVER :P

The Outer Limits? What's that?
A sci-fi show not unlike The Twilight Zone.

Twilght Zone is PWN.
Although The Scary Dpor is the best, even though it won't exist for another 1000 years.

"I was related to the guy from Pochanhantas lulz"
There would be a MOB of rabid fans tearing down BBC buildings all over the globe. On the live news there would be just the building shaking and the camera on it's side before the news woam righted it. "Hello? Is anyone out there? The fans are attacking! The others went outside to try and stop them, I think I'm the only one left alive *BANG_CRASH* Oh SHIT! They're inside! They're in the newsroom! HELP! *fans dive on her body and start rip

Did anyone else notice the shittiness of the animation of that shot he first fired at the golem? He didn't even pull the string tight, didn't aim at all, the arrow flew at the completely WRONG direction for where it WAS aimed, it flew randomly, with the tail flailing about like some pile of shit.
I might've but I haven't played it in years.
I'm very critical so I prolly did notice.
What do you mean played it in years? I'm talking about DotD.
Ah.
Thought you meant in PS1.
No. Lol. It'd be ACCEPTABLE in a PS1 game, maybe even in PS2 up to AHT, but NOT in DotD.
Maybe.

Yes.
Yes.
I can.

Warning.
YOSH!

Ironic.

OMG just now I read the funniest thing
and cause of that they said they never were coming again :(
well coming on here
3:
Hey ho
Do it, strike her down in your rage, and your journey to the dark side will be complete!
"I'm not angry, I'm amused at your quest for attention through self-abuse. The only response that you get for your pleas is sorely less than sympathy"
How coincidental.
GAH! Big words!
wow, I missed alot
/_\
yea i didnt ignore your warning
Ignoring your warning
I don't see an issue in what she said.
*I trying
But, what did I do...? :(
whatever
Huh.
I apologise for 'trying to annoy you' humble *cough* leader. Please do not smite me, since I'm talknig to more interesting people elsewhere.

I'm not annoyed.

Hi

No let us all be silent, an admin has come
What? A storm drain?
It was a flash thing my teacher made
Lol
Yes well it's better. :P
But anyone wins by default over Razz
:P
It was about stopping people clogging them up XD
Does that mean that my shitty art is better than Razz'? :D
OW
Earing
ow
:L
YAY
That hurt like heck
least its alive in here...
I got my earring caught in my hair
Haha, cute
HA!
Hey, a poll from SFRB
THats original, lol wing straightener
"Eyebrows are God's greatest creation"
XD
Not now please
I'm waaaaaaaaay too tired to think...
And the fact she has to have some surgery :D
It takes like three seconds for me to gift it to you.
SR?
The bottom of her head stuck out like a bloody flag
DDR?
Well tough lol. Not telling. Besides, I didn't akshully mean that bit, I'm just too lazy to go and edit.
Yeah, whatever :P
I called you Razz in training thank you.
D:
:P
Get your facts right during an accusation.
How could you call her such a horrible name? :P
"Ets RUDE to swear and call people namezzzz" XD
Oh
Erm, I I cant do a trade to night
Why? It's easy and takes about three seconds on a live chat.
My finger cant hold down f5 that much XD
>.<
For what it's worth (probably not much) those trades never work for me
I've had my /brother/ try to send me one; we could talk IRL and it didn't work
"HE'S IN LUFF WITH KIM KIM'S IN LUFF WITH HIM"
D:
"Ets RUDE to swear and call people namezzzz" XD I love Kidsplay
Always worked for me. I gifted a stone to a friend in response for soem art (the picture itself came out looking like a girl, but oh well), and it worked fine. If it doesn't work, I think I can breed you another.
Tomorrow please kieran
Fiiiiiiiiine.
Hahaha

Thats why
She's fiive methinks
Too young for this place
=P
Too young for a chat about a purple dragon?
Meh
It seems like this place is more named after a purple dragon than about a purple dragon
Ahaha
XD
Yeah
No one talks about Spyro
We do, once in a blue moon
I shouldn't be a mod because I don't even like Spyro :P
I thought this place is For the people that had joined the forum about the purple dragon XD

Lol what?
What?!
Bah, never mind XD

WHAT THE HECK!?

My guinea pigs gave birth.AGAIN
D:
My sister took over my brother's computer time so I have to get off early for him
How many do you have now
Since I have no laptop anymore
I counted them last night
32
SIT STAY IF YOU ARENT A PEDO
What happened to the Laptop?
Parents disconnected the internet
D:
That's no fun
Hey RDX
Newest ones
So technically I still have it, but...
he's a pedo :P
They're cute :D
Thanks :D
That was last year
I only just noticed lol
RD12
XD
I just asked them to block the internet
Why?
*Coco
NO
WRONG PICTURE!
Buttons and Coco
Because I'll use the internet less if they do
I see
Or so was my theory
But it's not working
:P
lol, addiction
Yeah, oh well :D
I think I'll stay on at least until my brother comes and asks for the computer
Yes with the black slipknot shirt
Or I could go read Eclipse by Stephanie Meyer
:P
heh
They're crappy books, but I read them anyway
Exactly
It's like a guilty pleasure
They're just time passers
I'm ashamed to say that I liked the series
Everyone at school carries a bloody twilight book around as if it's a bible
I know a few girls like that
Thankfully not too many
I think I should watch the movie to see what all the fuss is about
The movie was OK
Don't bother
You wouldn't be interested
I saw it once but I had to see it a second time...e__e
That thing's going on DVD sort of fast
I don't think I even want to see the movie
It's on DVD in March
"hey brad, what are you doing?" "watching a movie about a vampire dude who wears a lot of makeup."
If the book sucks, I hate to imagine how much the movie must suck.... D:
The movie was decent
Really?
They cut out Bella's crap about how "handsome and angelic" he is
Oh, seriously?
Since you can't really hear her mind anyways
I might have to see the movie then
That was seriously annoying me
They don't even look like they sparkle...
lol...
Stupid Edward fangirls....
OH
One moment..
I know one girl that read ALL the books a year before the movie came out
.
DID U SAY EDWARD?
OMGOMGOMG
OMG LYKE YA HES SO HAWT
She went to start bitching about the movie XD
:D:D:D:D:D
TOTALLY
Lol
* I read
:P
Lol
O rly?
is it a forum?
http://edward-cullen.net/
is it a forum?
Seriously, read some of the comments
I was crying when I saw Bolt yesturday...
I refuse to see Bolt because id be indirectly supporting miley cyrus
I don't think there's a forum
Too bad, I wanted to join D:
"jordan: i love edward more than any og u i have read twilight seres 7 times FOR EDWARD!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE U EDWARD!!!"
hahahaha
Buut it I couldnt help but mock Miiley's poor voice acting skills
http://roflrazzi.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/celebrity-pics-kaulitz-fail.jpg
"Bella: I love you edward! You are so so hot! YOU DEFINATELY DAZZLE ME!!!"
if there was a forum we could all register and tell them how much we love edward
OH
Speaking of Miley, I saw someone with the same username as her on WoW last night. I killed her :P
Someone on Neoseeker posted this funny Twilight thing
I'll see if I can find it
It's like

hahaha
...................bored
I was so embarrased in borders when my step-uncle's daughter kept "ooh-ing" and "aaah-ing" at the Twilight merch shelf
I had to stand near it
*cries*
I would kick her
Or throw one of the bloody books at her head
yeah, but my mum wanted to watch it so I had to anyway
Nah
My parents wanted to see Bolt
But I refused to go
It doesn't even sound that good
Even without Miley Cyrus in it, I wouldn't be interested.
Anyways I would've said something to her but I've known her since I was born n shit
Yeah
"OOH LOOK AT ME I THINK I HAVE SUPER POWERS I'MMA TRAVEL BACK TO WHERE I STARTED BCUZ I'M MAGICAL"
It's not mine
I seen that comic before
I wish I could take credit for its brilliance, though
But I fail at drawing people
I know its not yours
But it was funny
I'd favorite it, but I'm trying to clear out my favorites on my dA account
Why?
It won't let me delete some
I don't want the account anymore
Lol
I realized that I can't draw :P
What? Now it's not letting me delete my own art?
D:
Lumps of human fat!
odd...
I cant draw at all
Not one bit
well, i can draw stickmen
It won't load the full view
Oh, never mind :P
"I'm nine years old and I'm setting myself up for disappointment! *grin*"
Woah.
LOL @ sparkly vampire babies
I know it's terrible XD
Her ex-boyfriend falls in love with the baby?
WTF?
Jacob.
HAHAHA THAT'S SAD
I figured, but how does he fall in love with a baby?
O___________________o
Doesnt it grow up quicker or something?
Its fiction, it doesnt need to be moral or make sense
I guess not, but still
(that was a joke)\
I thought Jacob was one of the only /sane/ characters
So that'll be why most girls in my classdont like my fiction stories
o___O
(yes, 21/22 are twilight fans)
Come on, stupid "art", delete already D:
>(
o_o
OMG
Gunna have to go soon =/

/me doesn't really care lol
......Woqw
Nah, don't waste your money
I'm quitting anyway
That's the problem
I'm trying to get rid of it
But it won't delete
Just press delete on everything
you can delete your whole account
that's what I did to unwanted things
im pretty sure
It's saying there's an error when I try
Try tomorrow
phone dA and tell them if they dont remove your account you will sue them for hosting your copyrighted content.
But I want my crappy art off the internet now D:
thats what I do when people host pics I dont like on imageshack
"I WANT IT NOW!"
:P
Clear cache?
Lol, they spelled "occurred" wrong :P
What would that do?
/me is stupid
I do not know
Eh, I'll try it anyway
I just heard it would help most errors on dA somehow
I'll just tell it not to delete my saved passwords
Though maybe I should... I think my mom was on my facebook account yesterday
Bah, how do you clear cache again? =P
Hey

-___-
"Huh?" "im asking did you like meet him on yooutube or myspace or facebook or somethin like that?"

"So there's this boy...and the way he laughs...makes me smile, the way he talks, gives me butterflies...and everything about him makes me happy"
LOLOL
Yep. People are morons
I honestly pity the people who made those
I think I found the most annoying song in the world...
If it's Sunshine Lollipops and Rainbows I don't want to hear it
SR put that song in my head and now I'm sad.
D:
no....worse than that...
I've never heard those songs before though...so I can't be sure
...Who's it by?
well, its one of those "FanMade" songs, created with a quote from a movie
its called "I've got a Jar of Dirt"
.....
...
Can anyone say PotC fangirl?
lol
"What's the story morning glory!?" "What's the word hummingbird!?" "Have you heard about Hugo and Kim!??!!"
I was just searching the web one day, and stumbled on it, and NOW ITS STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD!
There are only two "FanMade" songs that I actually like
And one is actually related to PotC
If I hear that Damn song again...I'm going to DIE!
Who wants to hear the song that SR poisoned me with?
sure
why not
Nooooo
>.>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_v468ptuXw Beware.
Oh, fine

She's not even attractive.
*gulp*
/me quivers
/me hears the song and his ears begin to bleed again
MAKE IT STOP!
AHHHHHHHHH!
Sunshine lollipops and Rainbows is what I feel when we're together!
:P
/me cries
/me passes out from blood loss
The people she's singing to look at freaked out
WHO'S THE PERSON WHO CREATED THAT SONG!!!!
THEY MUST DIE!
/me hyperventilates

OOO! JONASS BRUDDERS!

Fall Out Boy is decent.

"...what? This is by far the best of Spyro's DS games! How dare you! The rest of them suck, except A New Beginning which is good but not too great."

http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-8555-no-offence-but-for-the-first-game-its-pretty-junk.html?highlight=
GAAAAAAAAAAAABE
i'd perfer power metal...thank you
Bleh. Metal.
I despise pop, metal, "punk" and rap
such as Rhapsody, or Dragonforce....
Real Metal = WHITESNAKE + FASTER P***YCAT <333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
This little 4th grader at my school said she had a pet dragon
"Brace yourself, chick" "BRACE YOURSELF CONRAD BIRDIE! *punch*" "Hugo, you hit him! I never want to see you again! *cries*"
lolololololololol
Heh heh heh
Oh no...
I can share with you, my personal favorite song by Rhapsody
*cries*
"Wisdom of the Kings"
D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9wIs8roKy8
Live performance too...
....that's not metal
there are different Styles of metal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSvFVIyRDgs = real metal, original metal
So there
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpHLEm9-0bg ...what? WHAT? Someone said THIS was Pop!
That first one isn't metal...
ORIGINAL
FROM THE 80'S
YOU CAN'T DENY IT :P
Not the crap that y'all listen to today
yes....but its not the metal of the Nowadays
>___>
*cries*
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-260170.html#260170
here's an example of the metal Nowadays
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvquWIULIFA
*to
Heroes of Our time, By Dragonforce....
...When I said that I was reffering to rap and "metal"
Rap isn't considered music
It isnt music, its abysmal
I've never listened to Dragonforce, and just by listening to that song I can tell I don't like them
I only like one Dragonforce song
its considered something between Poetry and Music....but its neither
I don't consider rap music either, I just - Oh, forget it
it freaking sucks ass....I don't know why it even exists
Not all rap is bad.
in all honesty...I don't like any of it...
Through the fire and flames...like almost everyone else who heard of Dragonforce because of Guitar Hero...
I heard that song first....actually...before GH3
I said ''almost'
then, I started listening to more of their music...now I like all of it....
and I even have gained a liking for Rhapsody when I listened to Emerald Sword
it died in here again
lol and unfortunately I have to go, might be back later though
I'm actually drawing a... a.... a WOLF
Well, I'm getting off of here, so I can focus on my writing....
*gulp*
Bye
I think
Later everyone, I May be back
Imma make a channel
with like 10 eggdrops
:D
Unless thats gonna slow down my connection to all fuck
but its just IRC, so I guess not
He annoys me
Gah...
He annoys me, too
So... what happened to your conversation with that religious guy?
She got off
Let me check my messages
No reply
Not only are people morons, but they are also small minded
lol
Sad movie
It's true though

Huh... never heard of it

Someone on SF has a crush on kirby...
WHY KIRBY
KIRBY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A GENDER
D:
LOL
Kirby is terrifying.

One more thing for Dari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LjjFFWRkGo
Like, hi, wah.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KlEF8Y4eHg Ember is such a fricken retard
Eeeeeew
Ember
lol, you showed Dari my SpyroxFlame pic
We should convert people to SxF and have a fan base
.....no
Yes
Since TLoS ended the way everyone wanted it to end (because they just took all the fan's ideas) they can make a Spyro romance game where he and Flame are in LOOOOOVE <3
LYK ZOMG YAOI?
All Spyro fanbases will end up with "OMFG THEIR MAD FIR ECH OTER!"
/brick'd
....and if that happens I will smash every copy of that game I ever find
Gay pairings FTW
Are you overly str*ight?
because I can
I vote yes on proposition #1 xD
/me holds up a sign saying "NO ON 8"
/me does too
/me holds up a sign saying "I like pie!"
WTH is 8?
Well..... accept add CyrilxVolteer to it xD
No! Ignitus/Volteer!
But Cyri and Volty are perfect for each other xD
Iggy's to serious >_<

Ignitus... slash... Volteer...
I even support two of my female OC's being together
Fine. Have your own opinions. But Volteer will always go with Cyril =P
Even though I never planned on it
Nice

hmm
awh the second one is cute
Whoever that is is Scale Drawing. I fail at drawing, but I can make a perfect look-alike of an Am. Drag. pic by using that
That reminds me... I should probably stop trying to draw with a pen.
I'm so lame, I'm drawing my own characters in Animal Crossing style
/me snaps her fingers in everyone's faces. "OOH, SNAP!"
/me sticks her thumbs in her pockets and walks away
...
you lose your digit privileges
Thing.

Plegh
They can draw one pretty cool Iggy
It's... CHIBI
/me runs away screaming
Doesn't look like it...
It says "Chibi Ignitus"
It SAYS that
:P
Ewww Cynder
Yeah
I stopped watching it after she started drawing...
...IT
....
lol
a bit hostile are we?
Hostel.
We should make a "We Hate Cynder" club :P lol
Meowth, that's right!
Or, as I like to say...
Meowth, bitch.
LOL
That's awesome

"PUT IT THIS WAY YOUR ALL WHACKY IF YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON A ANIMATED THING.....i say you need to get out more and get a life.....not that i can say anything but anywho...."
Hey, I have a crush on the Hermit.

Oh, crap. I've said too much.
The Hermit scares me... as soon as he started talking to Cynder I instantly think "Oh god rapist"...
He's hawt
...
(shit... I need to stop doing that)
Oh-kay then... *backs away slowly*
>.>
Wow...that "Gives You Hell" song is pretty stupid
"When you come my way, I hope it gives you hell"
What the HELL is that.
Wow
That's..... retarded on multiple levels
Santa never gave ME hell...
Not even when I put it on the top of my list!
LOL
Y'know, I'm really glad Santa isn't real
Hahah yeah
Who would want a strange man to climb down your chimney at night and leave things under your tree?
I don't really like the idea of an old man breaking into my house now that I'm older and actually think about it
Not only that, but he SEES YOU WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING.
and WATCHES you...
He knows when you're awake

http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4060205/1/The_Secrets_of_Convexity
See what I mean by LONG?
That's not the longest either.
And they are all that size or bigger.
And there are 9 chapters.
Good luck reading it in less than an hour.
hm!
Uhh...
God.
I'm skipping stuff :P
Lol. :P
i just got on
The first scene is actually in a oneshot.
I'll link you
That story is really good!
Actually, I have to admit, nearly all the fan fictions I've read like that, Ignitus always has to watch XD
It gives me something to do
Ignitus gave a warm smile as he observed the two youngsters embrace. After several seconds he retreated from the doorway. "My young dragons, you carry the hope of our race on your shoulders." And that is nearly in all of them
Lawl
I'll find another
I will
Must of been removed :/

yea actually i am in a good mood
:)
Hell all
How nice to see you.
o.ohell?
Hardly running, I went to play DOWII.
And didn't let me reply to what you said.
no
because she asks about every little freaking thing.
That's your problem then isn't it.
Nope.
She needs help to learn to shut her fingers/mouth
You ran, so you lose.
lol
?
Of course, the proper question though, is can you?
Most people know I can, you don't because you always run before I get to have a proper argument.
http://www.mibbit.com/pb/g1EV2R I was soooo bored.
Right. Because you going "I win. You lose." whenever you run out of material, THAT's a proper argument.
*readonlywithcaution*
LOL.
I didn't run out of material.
I wasn't arguing yet.
huhuh
And actually I said that after making a statement which disregarded you unthought piece of crap.
(Away: Grabbing A Bite To Eat)
your*
Right. I believe you.
(Away: Grabbing A Bite To Eat....McDonalds)
I can copy paste if you want
http://www.flyingratsass.net/ponies/images/hamsters.gif
Watch it
Well yes.
But I find it hard not to argue when you agravate me.
I find it hard to not aggrivate* you when it's so easy.
Ok it was aggravate.
I don't know why what you say does aggravate me.
Probably because you leave before I get to respond.
Or ignore me.
I'm just that awesome. (Another dari response.)
I've only said that once to a n00b.
YAY
Nao away to mcdonalds..
No point wasting my time on them.
True
That proves it fails.
I don't like McDonalds
Has to be at least 50% fat.
And processed.
I like to stick with fruit...fresh fruit
Bull
I LOVE FRUIT!
Bull
I eat fruit
Lol
otherwise I don't eat
I do admit, I have seen Nigel eat fruit
Ooh wait for it
...
Waaaaaaaaaaaait for eeeeet
Wait for what?
there we go
..
Hahaha

Hmm

LOL
Wow.....
Was that a PM?
yes
o.o
Lol
She apparently got dumped by Brazilian spyro
xD
How can you have a relationship over the internet?
And she took SR seriously when he said he loved her in that random thread
:[
Wow....again
http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-8682.html?start=15 Near bottom of page
LOL
Yeah, I rmemeber seeing it
/me bangs head on keyboard seeing that she is still banned.
*remember
Banned?
yea....
hiya
Was it even on the forum?
nope
I have something REALLY important to tell her...
aw...
No..
It was through Mibbit PM
That shouldn't affect you on the forum
:
* :|
Screenshot?
:P
lol
LOL
Not that SR ever cares when we take the piss
MUAHAHAH
Because if he did, it would just prove us right.
:D
She didn't even do anything there...
I never banned her
Am I talking to myslef here?
Hold on
im searching for it DDR
But my offense was on here.
I called her some names :(
and I apologized
I thought Perma-banning was banned for Mods.
but she said she doesnt beleive it
and doesnt care
Has that changeda?
...
..
*changed
she said she perma banned me
Ban banning? Is that a contradiction of terms or something?
Lol
You can ban the act of banning for some people to ban.
Moderators are allowed to perma ban.
Have you found the screenshot?
/me is still searching
..
not yet..
its really full in her PB
D:>
Giving my laggy computer maor lag..
*moar
*more
MY GOD I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE
BUT ILL KEEP LOOKING X_X
I'm guessing you didn't save the picture?
no
my frickin god
its not in here
x_x
but yet im banned from SF
i know :(
Lol
Critical Information
You have been banned from this forum
x_x
yup its not in here
Lol
i checked all the folders
No we are talking about a issue...
What did you call her?
SR, can you unban me from SF?
And she said "Bye bye forever." And there it was I was banned forever.
What did you say to her?
I called her names..
Yeah....
And?
all I did was call her names.
I know that
But what did you call her?
Curse words.
But yet im banned from SF FOREVER just for that.
Do yo uagree with that? >_>
*you agree
XD
Yes, yet if I swear I'm kicked out.
It might deserve a punishment of some sort but not a perma-ban
I know.
I mean, not that it's a good thing, but I don't think you should be banned from SF forever
Like mabye a week ban from Spyrochat.
I know.
...-_-
I spammed a couple bad words to her
And now Im banned forever
Why forever?
Meh, well I'll see you guys later
And why on the forum?
The incident happened here.
See ya, DDR.
Bye everyone
I would think mabye a 1 week ban from Spyrochat, but not banned from SF forever.
That's sort of unfair.
It all depends on what SR thinks. There are no right on the internet.
*rights
yes
When he answers/comes on I'll ask him..
Oh you are here
hold on..
Spyroforum and spyrochat are linked.
But she banned me forever..
Just for that one incident
SR, off-topic, but did you get your DSL yet?
:(
She banned me forever for that one incdent
I dont think it should be forever.
>_<
..but whatever you want :(

XD

lol
i'm so bored
Only one person thingy per entry to SF
If your own personal logic states that you don't have the right to live, then you are full of fail.
Darkness, you don't have the right to say tha- oh
xD
well finalleh
You've gotta screenie that lol SR
(Away-Foodzzzzz)

Hello I am back
hi
hey
is it a good idea to create a new talk about anything thread? cause im thinking of doing one
Topics like that always end in failure.
its really hard when your banned *sighs*
Lol, yeah they do.
haha.

i was enojing talking on there beofre accedwin came along
Hm, guess he'
s on different tab
woah

whats the matter?
Because noone loves me...

And no-one likes him either
:(
:'(
I'm sad...
Truth hurts
and Unloved
Unliked*
SAME THING!
Not really
it just sounds better to say unloved
Un-loved means no-one especially likes you, un-liked means no-one likes you on any level
Apart from dis-like
then everybody dislikes be...
No, everyone either dislikes or just doesn't care about you
by a show of hands, who doesn't like me?!
/me starts to raise hand but waits to see who else will
/me raises both hands, feet, robotic arms, the magical limbs that sprout from his back and stands all of his weapons on end
/me grows arms and raises them
I have LOTS of weapons, although you can't see many of them do to their weapons-of-mass-destruction nature, and I don't want anyone wasitng them
okay, now, who HATES me, by a show of hands
/me raises both hands, feet, robotic arms, the magical limbs that sprout from his back and stands all of his weapons on end

Not funny at all
Use everything in your arsenal - that's legal.
Stupid Charlie the Unicorn....
That was the only restriction set by my benefactor. It has to be legal.
Who is it?
my opinion...
its funny
Okay
Random chinese hacker
but stupid at the same time
He hacked one of our clan servers
What game...?
/me begins floating
ALL of our clans servers actually, everything had to be shut down
Gmod
Just do it
:P
0 Hosts on this IP
He's not using it anymore.
Then I shall go complain.
wot is it with people and that stupid unicorn anyway?
Ok he's offline
:P
idk...
Lol.
its stupid humor
lol ok
thats why people watch it
He probably has a dynamic
oh so thats what its MEANT to be lol oh well
I find it stupid but in no way funny.
Is there any way to track a dynamic or something? Finding out what it's changed to?
thats what makes it popular.....its like spongebob
Dunno. Not really.
Spongebob has some funny lines.
back
Charlie has no funny lines
Because a dynamic IP address could be anyone in that area of China.
"put a banana in your ear!"
How is that funny?
idk
it just is
Dammit

Good idea.

Brb TV went all weird
Lawl.
I'm watching you through your TV
AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
THIS IS SOVIET RUSSIA!
Oh? What program do I have on?
I can't see what program is on, I can just look out through the TV screen
Then where is my computer desk in relation to the TV screen?
Where is my book-case in relation to my bed?
I can't see your desk.
All I see is your bed.
If you can't see my desk then you can't see me.
Nope...
What side of the room is his Brittany Spears poster?
o_O
That should be easy
lol giv up dari
That's above his bed.
I can see several.
And a life-size Michael Jackson doll
What colour is the wall behind the bed?
LOL
LOLOLOLOL
lol
...
Yep
Yeah.
a colour thats used in the colour spectrum
Didn't notice it there before.
So his mom won't get jealous
AHAH! I win, you can't get under my bed, solid wood.
It's only a thin layer of wood.
Then how did it get IN there?
You can lift it up
... How many shelves are to the left of the bed, counting the top one.
Oh and the wall is orange.
Nope. The wall is greem
green*
Lies.
It's orange.
Lol
Green
Orange.

Why are the guys in QI wearing Star-Trek uniforms? o_O
every colour has everycolour in it you know
lol
QI is funny
oh no thats hair
soz
Red doesn't have anything but red in it.
Blue has nothing but blue in it.
Yellow has nothing but yellow in it.
yes alright
i get ur point
All other colours are made of those three.
I win.
i meant hair colours
You lose.
lol ok
What about white?
White is a mixture of all 3.
Isn't that only in light?
they arent wearing star treck uniforms
It makes white, believe it or not.
What about clear?
:p
Clear isn't a colour.
I win.
r u watching bbc2 or DAVE
Go on, laugh daily.
What about black? Isn't black a lack of colour, which is a contradiction of terms?
lol
No idea what black is.
I think you're right though.
Like saying water is tasteless. Tasteless is a taste. Giving someone without a name the name 'nameless' giving them a name, which makes the name nameless pointless.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ejk5NOrR8 Lol
So darkness is...Nothing?
Darkness is a lack of light.
So darkness doesn't exist.
Its the other term for nothingness
So black isn't actually a colour.
Black doesn't exist.
Black is a lack of colour.
So.
WTH?
How does that work?
Black doesn't exist...
O_o
Your thinking too hard dari
I dunno, temporal paradoxes are fun though. ^^
Stop it
So if the colour black comes from darkness, which is nothing, black doesn't exist.
Wait, that means our text doesnt exist
So black...Is a lack of white...?
As darkness is a lack of light?
LOL
Imma go eat some cereal.
I live on cereal.
Lol
Heheheh.
ur not teh only one

/me goes and gets some
im going to get honey cheerios
As different colours of light travel at different speeds.
Does that mean that different colour lasors are more powerful than each other?
So red is the least powerful

Ooooorrrrraaaaaaaange >: D
...
Still waiting.

Absolutely no one can work out what it is about them?

I wonder if there are forums where being a n00b is against the rules...
Both of mine
Hahaha.
But I still have n00bs anyways
*shrug*
Yes.
a good enough reason*
Wheee.
:D
I love my loop-hole-alilic mind sometimes.
So, if n00bs was against the rules, who on SF should be banned?
Besides SR.
:)
Loooool
Such a long list.
lol
99% of the 2300-odd members.
Oh and since I'm admin of POR we don't really allow n00bs there either
i just read what everyone said
hi back
No shit sherlock
Uhh...
Don't forget the Twilighters!
Yeah ^
Them.
And all vampire ones.
All who claim to be 16 and aren- oh wait, we did him.

Anyone with bad grammar or spelling.
Blaze The Dragon and Blaze are two different people
Blaze the Dragon is around 16....
I will bug you till you get here.
Hey....
im only bad at spelling on here as i try to type fast to keep up, whereas like this its ok
He's ultra pissed because all his pads are bloody and I took the last fresh one :P
Bullshit
You're five years old.
Not only that, but he ran out of his Hanny Montanny ones :P
sigh i cannot be bothered to argue with people i don't know, as it is pointless to do so and i don't care what you think i am 16
They have freaking toothpaste and toothbrushes
Pads are bound to be next.
Meh. I have better things to do than argue the truth to someone.
Yes, but I'm too lazy to get them right now.
I want to see.
Get them please.
(I said please. Come on, not often you see that. :P)
maybe later.
Meh.
:P
?
His name is still read
After like 5 mins
Hahaha
*red
Oh.
He probably has a letter in there..
lol
:/
is this proof enough: Location: Oxfordshire, England/UK Occupation: At school Interests: Mastering Spyro games Gender: Male Birthday: 04 Feb 1993
otherwise he has one sentence in there...he may of just had to leave for a moment
I was spazzing out in front of my TV.
And why?
That's why it took so long
You put Malefor twice.
My archrivals favorite College Hoops team went DOWN to a team my team beat earlier in the year by 40. :) :) :)
Malefor is a Super-n00b
...Huh?
You have friends who are n00bs, lul.
Yeah, I was finding someone's name who was familiar
its off my profile on spyro forum
That was the only one.
ok let get the one of msn
:p
See, I was right...
erm
Text that you wrote yourself
how do i prove it then?
NO PROOF
-___-
Act your age, that's a start.
ok
/me never acts 16.
Except when I act like a clown at Basketball games
Or when I'm doing MMA
i don't act like a 16 year old i admit that
but its who i am
i dont act my age
Best you start now.
I don't act my age either
-__-
I don't act like a 16 year old, I admit that.*
I force myself to act older than I am.
yeah well you miss out on being a kid then
You can too.
I am sixteen, and I act younger or older, depending on the situation
I don't often act what is considered 'right' for children my age at my school.
i act older when im at school but on here i act younger as its how i am
Because I'm neither chav nor pike.
There's no difference between a kid, a teenager, and an adult other than maturity. I'd much rather act older than be purposely obnoxious and have everyone hate me.
i wouldnt really mind if everyone hated me for how i wanted to be liek, its my choice
Like me
i'd rather act like that...but I usually act older...
its just that...I'm a Spaz
Not really. You always act younger.
/me combs his mustache
Umm, no you aren't.
I am the spazz of this site. A decent one.
I would never guess you to be 16, or older.
You don't spazz.
I object.
you just freak out about FANFICTION *lykomg*
=/
He always is acting up
i dont judge people by their ages i just talk to them i dont mind really what their age is
I HATE HIM SO MUCH
Always denying me access
its who they are , as a person, you cant judge a perosn just by their age
/me pictures a room with all the bots in it laughing at the people who want inside to get at something.
We're judging you by your goddamn maturity. You're aren't sixteen. You don't know the difference.
...
He should die.
:D
:P
ok then im not mature yet, oh well plenty of years to anyway
Chuck Norris sux
HEATHEN
O_______________________________O
Not really, I'm younger and still have a very dirty mind.
BURN HER!
You........
You.........................
not in that way dari
Yep.
In that way.
But I am indeed Sixteen
But don't act it.
/me is disturbed in the head.
im mature in that way i know about those things but i choose not to use that information in jokes etc
But aren't all smart people somewhat insane? *Toasts Dari*
as its just seems stupid to me, but i admit can be funny sometimes
Things: If different colour light, travels at different speed, does that mean lasors of different colours have varying power?
http://www.youtube.com/stream?u=BrianObsessed&amp;i=0 RAWR
SOMEWHAT? If insanity is a measure of intelligence, then I am smarter than all strangely-super-intelligent furs (Tails from Sonic the hedgehog - 453 IQ), super intelligent super villains, super intelligent sidekicks, and real life geniuses combined.
There's only one way to settle this.
The insanity meter.
what?
/me is bored on YT
Nope, a mw = a mw, really the only thing different is what absorbs the light. Like for red, black and brown coloured things burn well, but lighter coloured things dont, whereas green can burn most lighter coloured things (with the right power)
I spent my boring school classes postulating how to murder someone and get away with it.
There is a gas laser that works in the deep deeep deep IR range, which can cut clear plastic
As the plastic is opaque to it lol
...Gas Laser...?
Right now: You stab them with something wooden and then burn the body with the wood. No trace.
Yeah
Big glass tube filled with a special mixture of gas, and one side with a mirror, and the other side with a semi-reflective mirror
Most IQ tests online are fake
BUT
Wow. You left dari speechless. I WANT A GAS LAZ0R.
It's almost impossible to have an IQ over 200
hahaha
You can get it done through a real test that you have to sign up for.
Those are legit.
Aint really portable tho :P
I don't care.
Don't listen to the crappy ones that you find on google.
But I would have though as different colours of light travel at different speeds, the laser has more kinetic energy, which would transfer to light/heat energy, giving it more power?
Those are absolute bull.
You can get little red gas llasers, but they require high voltage, so still not safe
:P
I want one just to cut through stuff and people'll be like "OMFG MAGIC!"
Clearly it has rub off on you
as you are acting like a drama queen
cool what plays have you done?
My IQ is 168.
You cannot have an IQ over 200.
Yes you can./
In UK 180 is max or something.
The highest is 228.
228? o_O
I don't perform in plays...I spent two years taking drama classes....
Mine is like....130? I just can't get it out
So the extra kinetic energy goes no where?
Some German dude I think.
oh gotcha
Like if you were to ask me how to explain something, I couldn't
The average adult IQ is 100.
but I can liek show you
Magic
Alot of the lasers energy gets dissipated into the air
Meh.
When it hits dust particles
:P
I'd perfer not to be a Show-off about my intellect, Thank you.
I think I am onto something...
It still has extra energy. I would have thought that would go somewhere.
and you just proved my point
School
Ever think of that?
I'm not showing off.
I'm pointing out facts.
If I wanted to show off, you would know it
A School's Drama Department....
There's your answer..
Not really any accurate way to measure it
!owner Things
Ha, you agree with me
Nope....I just enjoy writing
it relaxes me
and you want people to read what you write
ahaha
if you truely enjoy it, you don't care who reads it

That I do, I like to hear feedback on my writing...

13YALL R REDNECKS
2I'm not responding to any of you guys (Which I can guarentee that none of you haters have actually tried to watch and understand Nascar) who say, "Its just going around in an oval"
4The olympic rings would be a bunch of old fucking truck tires
4I understand Nascar fine lol
2All football is is running into each other.
4but it's boring as shit
4I used to watch it all the time...
4I just got bored
10Foorball is more exciting than Nascar
4At least Football is freaking enjoyable
4and as far as I can see lol
Football bores me.
All sports do.
4a lot more people watch footbal lthen Nascar lol
me too
13I hate all sports.
12back
13Sports suck.
Football. Random idiots getting massively overpaid to kick a ball round some hugely oversized field.
Wow.
Fun.
10I still can't believe the "Talk About Anything" thread got locked.
10heh
12yes why?
2I know you haven't seen EVERY sport ever played
12did it get locked
10Not many people have seen EVERY sport ever played
The best sport ever.
2None have
Chasing a huge round cheese down a very steep hill.
Can't remember what it's called.
4lol
13Sports are a waste of time.
Apparently the cheese goes up to 60mph.
whats ur favorite video game (if u have 1)
4Sports are fun if you can do them and are willing lol
2You've never seen many sports.
...
13That's why I'm a failure to my father.
/me 10likes swimming
4I love sports

If I ever met her...........

I've been in Karate for 10 years. :)
I can defend myself against an 11 year old.
4I think the funny part is that she does this to others and then when it gets done to her...
4Well, it's the normal reaction
13...........
2Oh no....
2Evil dots.
4D:
/me 2plugs ears

4stop pissing her off guys
2Too late...
4I was done, I just wanted to say that
2So I'm not allowed to respond to people yelling at me? (Mainly because I get trashed by her "opinions" all the time)
/me 2is done.
4stop fucking pushing it
*sigh* I have never seen a bigger hippocrite than her....
3I mean, there are millions of things we can talk about....
2Hmm........
13brb/bbl
2Does anyone actually play any sports?
3No...not here
4I do
2Which one(s)
4Used to
4I play Football....Track...and I did some Cross country skiing as well
4I'll play any sport if we have the people to do it
2I played a year of Football in High School, Basketball, and.....golf.
4I like golf as well
4and snowboarding is my all time winter favorite
3I would play golf.....
2Crap.
13back
2gtg.
3but I suck at it...
2See ya
4everyone sucks at golf until you commit yourself to it
3I'd perfer dodgeball...although its not an official sport
The concept of (And actually playing) gold bores me.
golf*
3golf is actually fairly fun...
Meh, I don't find it so.
3ehhh
4it's not for everyone
4you really have to be patient with it
4hard to perfect
13bored...
3I like it, but actually going out and playing it is something I'd perfer to do when I'm retired...
4I enjoy doing it with my father
10Merlin's pants!
3WHAT ABOUT MERLIN!
3WHERE IS HE!
/me 10is blown off her feet
10literally
3I'm sort of a "legend and myth" hunter...
10U MEEN LEIK GHOST HUNT0RZ?!
3no...
3I've been searching for Merlin...
3for about a year now...
3I know for a fact that he existed at one point, and he still has to be alive somewhere....
10...
10I was, uh, just making a Harry Potter reference
/me 10opens up The Princess Academy and holds it in front of her face
/me 3opens a word document and begins writing
3*typing, sorry
10Bah. I don't understand why kids my age think they have to "date"
10Like Dimensional Spyro
3...
3I didn't understand any of that....and I'm more focused on getting this piece done...
13Then get it done and don't pay attention to the chat, jeebus.
10Cheesus
3-.-' hn....
4They should not be dating
4they have no idea on how to control emotions like that
4especially at that age
4it's idiocy
13Yeah
13I can understand little crushes and stuff, that's natural
10Yup
13But dating n shit/serious relationships at that age is different
4vastly different
4it's a very dangerous and serious emotion
10No relationship can be serious at that age
4you should not even be doing it until you can understand it
4I don't even support it in High school
10Which they don't
13I would say 14 or 15 should be the youngest
10I think of teenagers as kids
4To me I don't trust anyone with the emotion until at least 18
10"Child" and "kid" mean different things to me
4if that
10She made another one
10This time in General Chat
4 13 was my first date
13That's fine, it isn't in Fan Clubs.
10>.>
4of course, we all know what happened 2 years later..

10...Look at their location
13Yup
13It's him
/me 10waits for the ban hammer to be swung
13Personally I think in order for him to quit bitching he should be given one more try, Idk...
4Don't think SR is here right now
13Damn.
13Yes.
13I want to know what SR says..
4hm
4most likely he will keep him out

13But you never know when someone will change their mind *shrug*
4true
4But he took off awhile ago
13Yeah
4don't know when he is coming back
13I'm just thinking that maybe it'll stop some of the incidents.
4It might
13I'll wait til I hear what he says.

13Did you raise some hell?

Nick spam :D
all my old friends like twilight.
13Ohnoes
13Is that all they talked about?
So I spent a good half an hour making fun of it.
Thankfully, no./
6lol Twilight sorta sucks xD
13XD
13I thought the first book was halfway decent
13I don't know why it's so popular though
13There's lots of books like it but they aren't bashed.
6So far I've only read the first one, and I've been told the movie fails xD
I've only seen the movie trailer and it looks fial
fail*
6And I really don't see either...
Its bashed because its popular for no reaso
reason
It looks as though some guy is flying out of a window and running through the tops of trees, like in those stupid Chinese fighting movies.
13The movie was halfway decent, at least you didn't have to hear Bella describe how "handsome" Edward is through the whole thing.
FLY!
13LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
13LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
13He didn't post.
13I just want him to quit bitching
I don't.
I just want him to quit bitching about it
If he's back there'd be no bitching.
I don't.
=/
Ban him
I thought so before, but all he does is bitch bitch bitch more, more, and more. I just want him to quit harassing everyone
Its your duty to keep him banned.
13Ok.
banned
I don't "like" him. -___- I have to friend him on sites though so he doesn't bitch to me.
He USED to be a good friend.
Til he endlessly went on.
=/
I only want him to have another chance so he'd quit bitching.
I'm tired of it.

12Bah, I think I'll wait a while before I go downstairs. x_x
12Woo-pee, still banned from SF.
12*Sigh* O'well.
12I really gotta work on Zephy's avatar.
12But, Im too tired. I'll mess up something for sure. D:
12x_x
/me 12feels sick today..
12my frickin' cousin gave me this cold I bet....she was ovarz last night, and was coughing like crazy,
12Brb, shutting door so I don't wake somebody up.
12Good mornin'.
3morning...
12dah...
12someone pass me a pillow..
12x_x
3"
/me 12is to tired and feeling way to sick to move out of her bed.
/me 12is lying in her bed x_x
12Oh, I don't feel good x_x
/me 12lies on pillow
/me 3looks for something to read
12Did you ever read the book Eragon?
3no
12Not the movie, the book..
12Oh.
12I hate the movie.
12I love the book.
3yeah.....the same people who made the Eragon movie are making the Spyro movie
12Some things in there are to complicated for a 9 year old to understand though :P So I just roll with what I know.
12Omg,NO.
12NONONO.
12That could ruin Spyro forever.
12:(
3I'm wondering how they're going to Fuck it up....
12When is it coming out again?
12I want to see if it turns out good, probably not.
12:( That could ruin Spyro forever though, and that would suck.
12I will still stand by Spyro though, and I still like it.
12*SaluteSpyroPlz*
3.....I'm wondering though...if Spyro and Cynder were "Slammin' in the Meadow" after DotD
12Oh lord, LOL.
12http://www.mibbit.com/pb/vpG3h1 <--- OH MAI LORD
12Didn't they kiss at the end of DOTD?
3no

10A school is a place where you are picked on by immature kids, learn, and eat shitty food
10At least, my current school is
Thats the one
Actually, my school BEG for food
9Catabaus: That shall become the official definition of a school.
/me 13comes out of the closet to complain about schools (((:P:P)))
THe prices are about £1 for a pizza about the size of a tennis ball
10The school food is disgusting, the kids think the most important thing in life is being "cool" and looking good, and my teacher brings her religion into the classroom
13....
We can get cake the size of around 15cm big for 80p.
9XD
10She describes third person as "God looking down on you"
And pizza you can get around a large plate size for 1.20
7I thought the cake didn't exist Dari?
It doesn't, but people still sell it
9*teacher
10THE KEK IZ A LEI!!!!
7Ok, fair enough.
7Is your AOL translator on?
9The cake brings joy to virgin
9*virgins
Technically it exists, but as it virtually contains nothing, it is called a lie
And yes
It is on
/me 9invades Dari's mind.
6?
10Y'all
7script*
/me 9puts Betty Crocker stuff in Dari's mind.
Who's Betty Crocker?
/me 9paints the wallls of Dari's brain lime green.

GLOWS UNDER BLACK LIGHT!
WTH?
Black light?
Black light doesn't exist
9yES
That's darkness
7Oh jesus
10It's so annoying to have to write "Harry, Ron and Hermione" over and OVER AGAIN
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOpva_iit-8 here's a better one watch it
10Damn reading logs
7Surely though, darkness DOES exist? Simply because no light gets there does not mean it is not there, it simply does not reflect any light and therefore cannot be seen by our eyes.
Light reflects off every surface, just some more than others.
And there's still no light there.
Because it is in the shadow of an object.
10Shaymin is creepy
It the light does not reach the surface.
4*in creepy way* do-do-do-do....

10What do you mean "why?"
10If the chat's dead, it means no one is talking, or hardly talking at all
oh
13PUTPUT SAVES DA ZOO YO
11like i was saying earlier the is a new TLoSgame called the hour of darkness
11hello??????????????
10There IS NO NEW TLOS GAME
11is to
10The last TLoS game was DAWN OF THE DRAGON
10TLoS is over, Spyro is not
11i saw it on the internet
10...
10Oh, okay
10It's on the internet, so it must be true
11they're going to release it in the fall
10Uh huh
11followed by the movie
10Yeah, sure
10I gotcha
11i'm telling the truth
10Right
10No, no, I believe you... Really.
11serious?
10I mean, just because TLoS is a trilogy and there are three games doesn't mean it's OVER.
10Of COURSE they're going to continue TLoS.
11search on google for The Legend of Spyro movie
11it should be there
10Alright, I'll play along.
3they are just going to continue it under a different name
11no they won't
3-.-'
11:P
3A sequel to the trilogy....it won't be called TLoS
11the name of the new movie is Spyro
11by the producers of Eragon
10Of course they will continue TLoS, silly! It doesn't matter if TLoS is *CONFIRMED TO BE OVER*
3-.-'
11in the darkest hour Spyro has to face the dark master
10They are turning ANB into a movie. It doesn't mean they're continuing TLoS
10Spyro already confronted and defeated Malefor
10"The Darkest Hour" was what Dawn of the Dragon was originally going to be called.
11i said the dark master i didn't say anything about malefore
10They are NOT making another Spyro game called "The Legend of Spyro"
10MALEFOR IS THE DARK MASTER
11will to
11is not
3MALEFOR IS THE DARK MASTER!!!!
11the dark master was the first purple dragon
11not Malefore
10Malefor was the first purple dragon. Malefor is the Dark Master
3Whom is Malefor
10THEY ARE THE SAME DRAGON
11are not
/me 3rubs his temples
4IS this anohter nerd fight?
3I don't know...
10I'm starting to think this really is someone playing a trick on us
3-.-'
11if you played the first game ,the eternal night ,the chronicler says that malefore was born long after the dark master
10Spyro the Dragon is the first game
10Then came Ripto's Rage/Gateway to Glimmer
11in the legend of spyro
10And after that came Year of the Dragon
10The Eternal Night is second in the trilogy
10And I have played Eternal Night
10The Chronicler never said that
10I'll even find the cutscene
11did to
10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pulw6KggkXE
11in dawn of the dragons malefore says that there have been many purple dragons
wtf is with "spyroli"
10I don't know
2:P
2is not
3he is
10I think the "Dark Master" might of been his working name
2is not
10You know, until they could find a good name for him
2no that's not true
3Malefor is the Dark Master......
10That's why it's called the mountain of Malefor
3Play DotD
2is not
2because
3and at the end you fight The Dark Master AKA Malefor!
