but pretty much everything that suppors the classic controller supports the gc controller, atleast everything ive tried
ios 249 rev 19 FRAG base : IOS 37 mload v1.0
yea, then you dont gotta worry about batteries either
just plug em in :)
hm, it's done then, i'll get the gc controllers :P
This is weird
Lol
ya
I like it!
:D
i think you might need base 38 for the installer to work if it is the same problem that wadmanager got
:D
if i didnt already have a raise id be considering leaving myself
:(
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

same series
oh hey i notice it says to install the current selection you need the files in fat0"/ios/000000001000etc
(37)
Inorite
could it be that i dont have anything in that root
"i had lived in an orphanage because i fired our parents"
is it indianna jones lego , or indiana jones orifginal adventures to get 4.3 softmod ?
who's still in it?
i haveto lol at that one
XD
he won
what
again
You should fire your parents
:<
:D
I SHOULD
so should i try with a 36 will that work with what im trying to do?
:D
but you have to be obcenely rich
All the more reason I should be a manager of Walmart
She is
screw the rule i have money
everybody who lives in her town is
:P
try and you will see
ya
k
Although that wouldn't exactly make me rich I don't think
Oh yeah, I forgot everyone where I live is a millionaire
Hmm
Mhm
explained by your private school and all that jazz
and lack of a public school
Yeah right
maybe can screw the rules cause she has money
hehehe
I went to public school most of my life
nice job sexual it looks like that may have worked
ive been in a private school most of my life
but some people we went to school with beleived that everybody from her town is rich
they were from my area
There is a section of my city specifically for obscenely rich people though
ahh crap got 6 of 15 dld and am getting a error making http request?
which makes everyone who lives near me stupiud
*stupid
sounds like an internetproblem
You have to be invited to even get in there
there is here too
well, not that much
no invites here
There's an admission gate and hedges around it so you can't see it
just that you have to be rich to be able to afford to live in the rich part of town here
yup its going fine now
/me has seen this part of town, from the outside of course
then they shot me for looking at it too long
Why would you even want to live in a closed off area like that?
Seems stupid to me
I agree
but of course they'll just say I'm "just jealous" or something :P
so you know your neighbors arnt gona steal from you i guess
/me pops in
keep the Hamburglars away from their rich-person-McDonalds or something
nice thank u very much man it worked all miont
you are the man such a big help thank u
/me would rather live in a mansion :3
Speaking of hamburglars
i had one of those third pounders the other day
with...
bacon...
:o
i'ma hungary now
wow so I just started with linux today and it def takes time to get use to
you're a third world country in Eastern Europe?
nyet
jj26linux, you have no prior experience with a unix-like system?
HERE COMES THE LAG TRAIN
nope none
figured id get my feet wet tpday
ouch
read this then
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
we are a proud people with rich heritage and ground beef that rivals that of mcdonalds
the console is an integral part of the system, so you should learn how to use it straight away
I have kubuntu does that matter?
nope, the basics are the same
XD
any program to get my dual screen back?
google is your friend
http://www.lockergnome.com/linux/2007/06/18/dual-monitors-with-ubuntu/
Hehehe
(ubuntu and kubuntu are the same operating system, they just use different window managers)
heres the deal my fellow comrades.... i think i modded my friends wii correctly, but one thing is for sure... dvd-r from memorex dont work lol
if he's got a new wii then no dvdrs will work
its old
xD
LU379 or some shiz
aha, try writing them at a lower speed, and if that doesn't work, try another brand :p
!do test
/me test
verbatim > *
do it oldschool at 2x
:D
and of course, usb > *
i did 4x
still its like
is this shit supposed to auto load if it does work?
or do i gotta goto hmc
and like load from gx
well im just tryin to rule out that dvd-r does NOT work
even though my wii can't play DVD-Rs, I'm loving usb loading. i have a modded psx and i have a million cds floating around
we havent gotta external to test with
atleast not FAT32 and i have like a gizzilion hd shiz on most of em
so i dont wanna fuck with that route
word
!do insult
wii can read ntfs as well
oh it can?
with what? i thought it took only FAT or FAT32
yes...but ntfs is read only... meaning you can't use a usb loader to copy commercial games to the usb hdd
yup, but no scrubbing unless you store them as wbfs files, and you can't write to the disk
microsoft should open-source ntfs specification so writing fully-featured drivers would be easier :P
yes
fat is rihtarded
fat32 > * when it comes to wii
fat32 is good
whats wrong with good ol NTFS?
i use wbfs though, because i don't use much homebrew, and the homebrew i use is lauched from the sd card permanently installed into the wii
heres the deal will i still need the sd card in there?
/me is talking to an old friend on MSN
that SD card is mine lol
no
not unless you set up forwarder channels
10-4
with fat32 you don't need an sd
with CFG?
who's that?
guys how can u get a wii game to appear in uloader?
im following a guide and it says now all you have to do is plug the hard drive into the wii and boot uloader.
find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
turn on usb saves and "use DLC from x:/nand/
then click ok. twice.
now load game.
no, I'm just curious :(
Miguel from the second spyroforum rebellion
ah
/me is now away - Reason : Haietus
/me is now away - Reason : Haietus
gx
*
xd, do u recommend to have forwarder channels?
:o
/me is no longer away : Gone for 25 seconds
/me is no longer away : Gone for 25 seconds
/me grabs popcorn and listens to drama
nope because then you cant use the channels unless you have an sd card in there at all times
lol
/me is now away - Reason : momento mori
/me is now away - Reason : momento mori
25 second hiatus?
10-4
well i "merged" some shit together
thats all i remember
i think that was just part of it
i don't use cfg for anything else but ripping games, so i don't know if you can install it into nand, but you can install usb loader gx into nand with the WAD provided at their google code page
but i had to use "36" not "236"
cuz i didnt have "236"
I'm assuming Miguel was on your side during the rebellion?
:P
I thought the cfg forwarder... *forwarded* to the SD card
Yeah
then again, I'm not a CFG user, so pardon my ignorance :P
and pardon mine as well
I just told him I left SF because SR got mad at me for something completely retarded
im still learning about it
lol
His response: "rofl"
truth
i modded my 360 yrs ago but it just got the RROD
but still funny
so im focusing my attention on me and my friends wii
ha
red ring, isn't that xb lol :p
yeah
its lame as hell
if you format your usb hdd to fat32, you can copy the contents of your sd to your usb hdd and boot off that
and supposedly u can use whats called "X-clamp" to fix it
but even then its kinda 50/50
cfg forwarders arent any different from gx forwarders
its like $25
i read something about that over 20% of people recieving their xbox 360 had the red ring within a week
if they are setup correctly they search for sd and usb
for all the shit including the "artic thermal paste"
with only 6% having problems with the wii
gmail ftw
same goes for Gmail
:D
well im modding my friends first
/me has MSN and Gmail
to see if i wanna mod mine
lol
:(
its done but i still need to test his with ext usb hdd
can i test it by just putting something on my ntfs drive?
just to make sure? or how do i know its modded?
install cfgloader, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager
10-4
:)
:|
hey sexual im literally on my last step how can i get rock band 2 to be seen in uloader all i see is like vc games and my scumm emulator and homebrew channel
:(
didn't stay
:)
jk
:D
the guide says now all you have to do is plug the hard drive into the wii and boot uloader.
find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
turn on usb saves and "use DLC from x:/nand/
then click ok. twice.
now load game.
i dont use uloader so no idea
so once i get it to .wbfs i open up wii backup manager
what format is your hdd?
on the wii
and load the wbfs with it
my hf sexual ?
its fat 32
shit fire
im not a smart man jenny

"No two species are identical. All must be judged on their own merits. Treating every species like one's own is racist. Even benign anthropomorphism." ~ Legion
/me goes to #spam
I lol'd
yeah
any downfall on downgrading i heard it can be bad?
/me doesn't get it
I lol'd at his view of racism I mean
well i wont do yet till i see a better way as i read tut and i like a better way so ill wait
pretty much the opposite of the modern one
downgrading is pretty much unnecessary
damooo
yes
?
also, look at this "Fanservice: A surprising large number of your squad members fall into this, unlike in the first game where everyone full suits of armour. Ironically, the romance scenes were toned down."
typ the command ? downgrade
XD
and follow the guide
Sounds like it was quoted straight from you
downgrade
It does
Boo fanservice
?downgrade
with the ?
I agree
with space
? downgrade
there you go champ =p
cheers
downgrade
?downgrade
lol
why would people downgrade? does 4.3 cause issues?
That means you Cynder, Miranda, and every single character of Twilight!
yes
problems
best to downgrade
with what?
and it has quto-update
i was reading something on a softmod for 4.3u....something about installing a korean ios
it wont ask u to update
"The very end, after you defeat Sovereign. Debris fills the room, fires are everywhere, and the rescue crews are working their way inside. They come across your squadmates, who are dazed, shocked, and look as if they've just had their world crushed. Quiet, sad pianos sound in the background, and Shepard is nowhere to be found. The camera pans up to show the shattered windows and the massive piece of Sovereign lying around, and it suddenly s
looool
it will do it now on its own
quote incomplete
but sounds very accurate right there
It showed the whole thing for me
Where did it cut off?
The camera pans up to show the shattered windows and the massive piece of Sovereign lying around, and it suddenly s
? downgrade
seems as if Shepard really is dead. Then the music begins torise, you see boots running on the floor, and right as the music hits an intense, heroic crescendo, Shepardclimbs up into view. Commence the cries of BAAAAAAAAAADDDAAAAASS! If you're not feeling like a Big [censored] Hero at that moment, you're not human."
yea, the thing i was reading was about using the korean ios to install cios and shit
for 4.3
but whatever, im on 4.2 anyway :)
downgrade ?
O.o
I just pressed "XD" and got a debug screen
http://gbatemp.net/t238889-4-3-virgin-softmod-guide <---- what i was reading, i believe
never tried it, so cant confirm
...wtf?
fuck 4.3
Ah
How do you "press XD"?
Ctrl + "D"
there is no reosn to be even on 4.2
for that matter
i dont see the difference between 4.1 and 4.2, but i dunno
4.0 here.
well, the "X" and "D" keys is what I meant
wii came with 4.2, so i kept it at 4.2 :)
*I pressed the X and D keys
Yeah, there's no reason to downgrade from 4.2 if you're already there. But no reason to upgrade to 4.2.
thats how i feel
but anyway
you know you got goosebumps at that part
if i mod a wii that has 4.1, i just leave it at 4.1
I know I did
:P
obviously, system menu version after 4.0 doesnt really matter, since ios can be updated individually
possibly

there is already one
really?
http://filetrip.net/f9332-SuperDump-1-3.html
anyway, I just updated my wii shop channel through wiiscu but wii shop still says it's not up to date and asks for a system update
and I'm trying to figure out why
this works with dvd movies?
with like
no
video_ts and audio_ts?
use your pc
duh
he wanted to rip a dvd to a wii
not a dump
witch is ironiclky stupid
to my usb drive
yes
witch is ironiclky stupid
wii suxs on dvd vid
haha
what be the perpus of doing tht anyways
hell if i know
tee hee
there isnt any apps' wii side to play video files of a dvd mo\vie
2eh?
seems not needed is why he left
only system i know that can play dvd iso's console wize is xbox with XBMC
well food time im to old to miss that and wife kills me and work tommorow have fun shadow will need help with a psp someday :)
ok
yepyep
seriously, though, why would a single website be down for only me?
could this be a high-level routing problem?
anybody happen to know the latest wiiscrubber version? just trying to get a dual layer super smash bros to work on the softmod...
or your router
or upstream to your provider
or your hosts file
or your DNS server
no problem
the IP I get for wiibrew.org is 195.178.184.67
um
u dont do anything to the game
that is correct
burn it to a DL dvd
so you can ping it correctly?
and be sure to use the correct layerbreak
funny, it resolves to 2001:9b0:102:babe:1010:0:0:14 for me
well...i did...and my nephew said it didn't work. but i didn't set the layer break. didn't know i needed to for the wii then.
if there is one game i buy this year
well I can ping it, I get no replies
this is it
http://www.411mania.com/game_article_pictures/13150.jpg
i'd still rather scrub it, if that works, rather than wasting another DL on it.
Hi children
but even if it were working properly in principle there could be an ICMP-traffic-blocking firewall between me and it
try a proxy
/me sleeps now
2084960
/me sleeps now
fierygt, 2084960
and that seems to work
damn, though, this is irritating
use a DL scrubbing it will not get it on a dvd5
burn to a DL
damn. alright. i suppose i'll use a dl. thanks.
why burn?
realy?
USB FTFW!!!
set your DNS server to 8.8.8.8
and that IP is an empty server for me
still resolves to the same ip
because he doesn't have a freaking external usb hdd. when i initially gave him the game...i had his wii, and i did try it on one of my usb hdds, and it worked, so i just went on and burned it, thinking it would be fine
maybe the old address is cached locally though
do you have a cable router
it might be awhile
before its dns cache flushes
try flushing your cache
just got back from watching dispicable me
be a good unkel and buy his a drive
/me declines, is currently having his mouth occupied
to say with russian form of grammar and sentence structure
sheesh. i find him all the games for his wii and DS as it is!
well
hoe old is he?
set the IP on your computer, not the router
about 9
(for DNS)
ok
read pm
hi shadow
was it any good?
mmm
I did
restarted ncsd after setting resolv.conf to 8.8.8.8
still getting the same ip
that IP is correct so yea
/me is too tired to eat
And apparently I don't get nick alerts from /me
interesting
anyone have experience setting up DKP with VS
195.178.184.67 is?
yes
what u wnat?
I get nothing pinging that from my own machine and a machine is alive message pinging it from another machine I have shell on in another city
Name: wiibrew.org
Addresses: 2001:9b0:102:babe:1010::14
195.178.184.67
theres a dvd5 of it
but all the FMV is removed
basically ruining single player gameplay
imo you need it :D
I do
gay ass shit is what that is
cuz James wrote me a custom nick alert system
I want to play exciting video games
nope
o_o
I woork like 7 hours till my back is bleeding

04the roof

So my dad bought my little brother an Action Replay, and he wants me to help him get some codes running. Well, see, I had a bad experience with a GameShark a few years back, and I want to make sure that I do everything correctly
:P
AR for which platform?
DS
oh, no experience there
Yeah
I'm a bit skeptical of YT videos
02wb
So... uh, I'm running in the dark
wooflow is shit in the first place

DUN DUN DUN

04ty
i got 4.2 down pat 150 under me , but 4.3 all diferent
Yeah
why even upgrade to 4.3
I read it
not mine , friends

But it doesn't have, like, any special precautions
Just common sense warnings
PUT IN CODES
CHANGE GAME
GO?
:|
:P I just don't wanna have that same experience that I had with the GameShark
Oh, btw, I found out that it can actually load homebrew
Via microSD
12wild Lyon is happy
cant run 4.3 unless you downgrade i thought so why want 4.3 if you want to mod scince im going to bed shadow is right why bother?
they still make gamesharks?
I'm talking back when I owned a GBC
I had one for it
dont have to downgrade to run 4.3
its optinal
And GS + young boy + PKMN Gold = bad
lol

i dont use so not worried about it
02whats up
04the roof
I don't like the way the snes buttons are mapped to wiimote+nunchuck buttons in snes9x
and I don't see a way to change the mapping
:(
02your floof
you should be able too
if not
you can compile the source

i have u beta 24
gave*
well can u send me?
http://www.sendspace.com/file/0swy6x
thnx
i wonder if any of these apps will ever end up being final versions :)
beta one million
can i just overwrite the older version?
what i gave u is the forwarder and app
so u have to have a sd card in wii all time
to use it from the wii menu
witch is better
yea but wad install needs no sd card right?
forwarders r wad's
they arnt the app too
i dunno, i had a wad that i installed where i dont need any sd card after
the app resids on sd card
just installs on wii nand
pretty cool :)
well thats a problem
when new version comes out guess what
i delete the channel and install new version?
so far its good
u will have top find that wad u used to install the older version to uninstall it and then install the new version
withc a forwarder all u do is updat ethe dol
done
i just go to wii channels menu
and delete
thats wrong
works fine for me
shit
u like leaving the ticket saround?
i dont know how to use a forwarder
honestly, sure, why not
n00b
i know
extra tickets around whats gonna happen
fuck my life
not u Ib
ignorance
why does it matter
what will happen if i leave tickets
ignorance
if it will cause a problem i would like to know
otherwise, i dont really care
figured
no im let u keep your ignorance
brb
thats because you have no explanation :)
like usual
anyone know of a cheap / self powered usb drive for use with Wii?
its just "wrong"
funny how sometimes there are more than one way to do things that works fine
im glad im not that o.c.d
heres the deal
if i had a previous version of neo gamma
and i got the latest and wanted to just overwrite the SD
could i do so
Has anyone here used uLoader to play dvd-r backup by usb dvd-drive ? (since I have the D3-2) I am wondering if I need a certain type of drive for it to work...
ah ok cool
viince, buy a ext hdd
so $69 for a WD 320gb essentials sound right?
yes
friends been buggin me to find a cheap / self powered
ill let him know
I have an old ide internal dvd , but have an adapter to connect to usb
I have hdd...but some games don't play from usb hdd
im using an old school IDE external drive, has its own power supply heh
but hey it works =/
I'm also curious if that would allow gc backups to play
Heya pplz~
ide internally to usb
viince, what games?
brb gtg pee
tom clancy splinter cell double agent, csi,
some others, I can't remember what they were...but if I can play the gc too that would be cool...
just wondering if anyone else had success or failure
gc off usb would be neat :)
suppose that would work to?
heres the deal gonna try the beta 24 neo gamma
it doesn't on usb hdd, but off dvd usb...who knows...
be back monetarily
momen*
ok keep us updated buddy
go series is wii incompatable
i wish i could ask about certain wii apps here without being crapped on
http://www.overstock.com/search?keywords=passport&refinebrand=Western+Digital&searchtype=Header
get atleast 500GB
no more no less
loading DVD
cross fingers now
DVD Error 1178
do we have to hold down the 1 button?
i have a 320GB, still havent filled it up yet
im 58% full on my 500GB
well
do we need backup manager before we use gamma?
no
im on this wii wiki page and it shows the seagate go as being compatible as long as you're running cios rev 14
wbm is for usb
so u should have them be running latest
rev19
shadow so what can i do about this error?
try another game
"Seagate FreeAgent GO 320 GB "Works- use the bundled software to disable inactive drive spindown (now available on the seagate site); or use cIOS rev14 (spindown fixed)"
use rev19
im sure newer than 14 is fine
yea
good thing a bout that drive is its right down the street at best buy for $59 heh
wouldnt even have to order it
Hello
WTF
u dont know your local bestbuy
what the fuck is wrong with u son?
huh?
i just said its right down the street heh
oh i read that wrong
go there all the time
ah ok
thought u saidu was going to right it down
lol
why would you buy the seagate when you can get this
http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Western+Digital+-+WD+Elements+320GB+External+USB+2.0+Portable+Hard+Drive/9832481.p?id=1218180648504&skuId=9832481
no drive spindown problems
yea ill go for the WD
thanks for the head sup
heads
thats the one i use, i bought it used at a pawn shop for like $40, works great
witch head?
LOL
ill have to get one of those myself , would make it easier to manage
instead of my current external which uses its own power supply
have to unplug it everytime i move it to my pc to add games heh
wiihack
hmm
lots of folk in here
anyone know anything about loadstructor or crap?
there was a kid with an Erector set in the Sandlot
that is a bold faced lie
essecks, no we dont
i'm never gonna get it working =o\
essecks, don't bother with it
it'll clutter your channels
just use a usb loader
i use cover flow
wow
thats old school
i just wanted to add a couple specific titles i used frequently
like netflix
get cfgloader
i wonder if we needed it set to a diff channel other than 249
essecks, gimme a sec..i'll check it out
and no matter what i do i can't get the bastards to work
<3
whats cfgloader?
essecks, http://www.sendspace.com/file/3rf94s
well than tiger 011 wont work with it
cfgloader looks like coverflow and you can install netflix to the hard drive
what if i burn at 2x?
even tho its shitty media
memorex
memorx is good brand
also known as cLoader?
wii reads them jsut fine
no
cloader wtf is that?
dunno
wii reads memorex just fine?
yes
i think it means Uloader
this shit should work! we fucked up somewhere down the line
too bad eh
thats what i burnt on for my wii games back in the day
okay, so cfgLoader is a usb loader that makes system menu channels?
we have a old wii to boot
essecks, no
is there a way to look up the dvd error codes given by neo gamma?
my 3.1 wii plays backups from dvds
essecks, its the best usbloader out there
http://clusterrr.com/dump/loadstructor.png that looks pretty self explanitory
does it have a homepage?
lucid what about a LU379?
i'll just ltfg
burn another fucking game
like smg1
shit
OH YEAH, i tried migrating to this way back in the day
holy crap i have dejavu
use IMGburn to burn your game
i used nero
should i use imgburn latest?
yes
there is were u fucked up
why cfgloader > cover flow?
nero is shit for wii
4x or 2x?
essecks, because its best
imgburn is good for burning everything, movies, wii games, xbox 360 games
http://www.imgburn.com/
ok i knew that for x360
i burn at 4x for the wii, i dont know if that matters but plays perfectly
and i will punish myself later
i have an older version of img burn
but ill get latest
http://www.imgburn.com/
maybe
k
imgburn is awesome
if you look at the disc that imgburn did and the nero disc you can see the difference
nero = bloatware
2x or 4x
16x
im gonna try the same game
cfg loader : http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
anyone tried/used tri-force
16x i thought slower
nah
i burnt all mine at 16x
never had a problem
if you have a pioneer burner i dont think it matters
pioneer FTW!!!

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALRIGHT
I win.
sup all
i just received my wii. it already came presoftmodded. im new to softmodding and have a lot of reading up to do. but right now i just want to play some games. so im about to go to the store to buy an external HDD (WD Passport). and im wondering if i need to pick up an SD card aswell. do i need one for installing homebrew and modifying stuff or will a USB HDD be enough?
also, i have already experienced that back-up dvd's run at slower speeds and can cause stuttering. if i rip these backup games to HDD, will that stop the stuttering?
Austin: ha!
yes
!rules
to both?
bor: an sd card makes it easier but is not needed per se, but I'd highly recommend getting one since none of the guides tell you how to boot without one
also, for certain steps the sd card is required, so if you ran into one of those, you'd need one no matter
alright, i doubt i will do much modifying to my system tho, as its a korean box and i read they are easiest to brick
ie. you can setup homebrew channel and others to use a harddisk but you can only install homebrew channel from SD
ah i see
they are just as easy to brick as any other wii, if you use an US update on a korean wii, that's a brick. If you use EU update on a US wii, that's a brick
the thing is just that so many people try to install US firmware on korean wiis
mkay
i have US firmware on it i think
or english firmware
there is an English hack, but it's still korean firmware inside
doubt the korean version will come with an english language pack
ah
and ehm, what file system for the HDD do you recommend?
fat32 so that homebrew channel can work with it
ntfs is read-only and wbfs is isos-only
but that has filesize limitations
so if you want to NOT use an sd card you will need fat32
and i already saw that super smash bros for example is 7GB
isos on the disk are stored in .wbfs files which are split in chunks of 1-2GB
USB Loader GX is installed on it already
but of course you're right, some people recommend ntfs to get around the 2GB limitation, but no wii app can write to ntfs
if i install games with that, will that auto split the games in parts?
depends on the version, most people here recommend using cfgloader instead of GX
k
any risks of bricking the box if i connect it to the internet?
obv i wont install a new firmware when prompted
but other than that, any risks?
firmware 4.3 doesn't allow you to disable auto updating anymore, but if that wii has 4.3 you'll run into many other problems anyway, I doubt anyone with a sane mind would install 4.3 on a softmodded wii
i think i have 4.1
it said 4.1u in the wii settings menu anyway
that's what you'd end up with when following most of the existing guides, yes
oh?
4.1u is the US firmware, I wonder what the previous owner did to install that without bricking
it came from a shop in bangkok, he didnt speak much english ;)
how do i install the games on the HDD anyway. is it just a matter of dragging the ISO's from my computer to the HDD, plug it into my wii and run USB Loader GX to install? or do i need a WBFS manager?
wbfs manager is for wbfilesystem formatted drives, wii backup manager is for fat/ntfs
cool thanks
will read up on that
both gx and cfgloader can dump actual disks to the drive too if it's writable (not ntfs)
? list
? list
no factoid for wii backup manager
? hddcompatibility
he wrote it?
no he's just usually very active in here, just now it's the middle of the night for him I think
right right
HERE COMES THE LAG TRAIN
!rules
Good morning everyone...
Ziggy^^: hi
I have noticed recently that my wii appears to have a certain lag when using homebrew
Hmm? Haven't heard of that before.
its strange
i have other issues but may go against rules so i wont ask those
is there something i can use that helps diagnose ios issues/>
syscheck?
!wb sysCheck
sysCheck: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SysCheck
sysCheck does several checks on installed IOS and cIOS:
Well, all that does is tell you about your IOS'
Then again, if you've installed cioscorp/similar... It's likely you'd have problems.
i guess i was thinking syscheck scanned drive for sectors but i guess that is bootmii
i never installed cioscorp
ive read a lot of bad things
it was running fine until i put this program on there that i found online that is suppose to help keep ios's up to date
it really screwed things up
since then it hasnt been very stable
does anyone recommend running one version over another (would that help in stability)?
i was running 4.2 but then went to 4.1 to see if it would help

12does the term "back seat driver" sound familiar
/me hides
lol
hihi
04Hi
04meow
hey RN, hows things?
04I'm ok thanks - got a fornight's temporary work in a law firm.
04how are you all?
03hm
03I'm watching this documentary about healthcare
03does the free NHS in the UK work?
04Maybe it will lead to permanent work but if not then I've earned a bit of money.
03as ther eare also rumors that you have to wait forever to get treated
04Ask someone like Xai because he's the expert in politics LOL
03LOL
lol
04well it's good if you have little or no money I guess
03because I'm slightly Republican
04but people who are rich pay for private healthcare sometimes
03and apparently that doesn't fly with him
03hm
yeah private healthcare ftw
03you've never hadto go to the hospitcal?
03-c
04Yeah
04I'm not rich so I used the NHS LOL
03yeah
03did it work?
03or di dyou have to wait forever
04But the hospital was so dirty I discharged myself
04well I had to wait 8 hours to be seen
03LOL
03yeah that's what I've heard
04I was cured, that's the main thing
04but...even if you've broken your limbs you still have to wait 8 hours even for painkillers
04well approx 8 hours
03yeah
04I suppose you'd have to go and buy your own.
only time i've been in an nhs hospital is when i broke my wrist, i was in and out in a couple of hours
04I had gastroenderitis and I just needed a drip and some antibiotics. They expected me to stay overnight but the dirtiness of the hospital made me feel even more ill so I went home.
03I broke my wrist and had to wait about 5 hours to be seen
04I've been bitten by dogs three times and those were the only other times
04Hi J Lugia
03but that's becau\se they prioeritize people who actually need urgant care
03like if you crack your head open or something
03they'll ese you right away
04Well I couldn't eat or drink and they still made me wait
04hehe
03XD
03yeah, it's probably crap
04If you pretend to have a fit in the waiting room that's your best bet to get seen first
04not that I condone that sort of thing
haha
04DRF let's just say the NHS is a necessary evil, otherwise there would be like a thousand people left
04Well - most people can't afford to pay to see a doctor like you have to in the US.
03there are plenty of people here who can't afford it
03they just die :/
04I know some people who wouldn't be able to afford the insurance payments for health.
03well
03most jobs here have free health insurance
04Ah, I didn't know that.
03I mean, not like minimum wage jobs or something
03but most salaried jobs will have it
03my family's insurancde is free
03through my dad's job
04Yeah I see what you mean. However - it's a sad situation when people have to be well off to avoid dying :/
03yeah
03well I agree that it doesn't work perfectlly
03-l
03the thing is MIchael Moore is kinda biased himself too
04What do the elderly do in your country if they don't have a job and are on a small pension?
03he's like a hardcore Democrat
03Medicre.
:D
03*Medicare
03*that's* free
03if you're over 60
04Oh that's good then.
03however they don't pay for EVERYTHING
03like you still have to pay for medicine
04Here you get free prescriptions if you're on benefits, over 60 I think or over 65 or under 18
04something like that
04or if you lie on the form - again just an idea, and I don't condone it xD
03well I dunno much about Medicare
03but people like my grandparents have it
03Medicaid is for poor people but it sucks
03and they don't pay the doctors enough either
04The NHS is ok to fulfull its purpose.
03my mom doesn't take it becaus eof that
04But some directors get like £100,000 a year
03but she's private practice so she's kinda meh
04of the NHS I mean
03yeah, the guy in this movie makes £100,000 a year
04so it's like....so you can't pay for breast cancer drugs but you can afford to pay them that money
04Glad to see they have their priorities right xD
04We even have a free vet service here for people on welfare.
04In other news, I know this is random...but I got woke up early this morning by a marching brass band :(
03marching bands FTW
04Yeah but not when you've just been up until 3am xD
04and all the neighbours are talking outside...and you can hear the band coming down from a mile away.

/me hugs soccer D:
Hehe, Link on the Zelda games always gets the ladies :3
i stick to football, its more interesting then watching these ppl just run after the ball without tackling eachother.. means there is no chance of the guys pantsing eachother :(
Trace: You might like rugby or la cross or whatever that soccer/football hybrid is called
soccer/football/hockey hybrid
And you can tackle people in soccer. You can do a lot of rough stuff in soccer.
Especially at the World Cup level
i have yet to see any of it :(
Unfortunately, at that level, there's more passing and less contact
6http://miburl.com/1Ti30e <-- ... how did I end up here again? O____o

The older youth games have a lot of contact

6:P
12?
guys im using a fat32 drive will that still work with game forwarders?
6Nice background. :O
12His or her what? XD
12Thanks
6Everybody thinks his or her art is rubbish. :>
of course
cfg
dunno bout gx
Well
cfgloader > *
10!lag
apart from arti
My drawings rival that of a 3rd grades
*grader
duh
!lag
12Whats wrong with "their" art?
o.o
but some lamas still use gx
10o_O
cause its pretty
!ping
k i cant seem to get it to work it loads a black screen for mario galaxy lets say and shows loadsctructure at the top and it appears its trying to mount a wbfs drive
>.<
10!pong
my 3rd form pic was pathetic i hated it
6Every/Any/Some/Any + Body/One are singular nouns. ovo
it counts down to 30 and then freezes
6-any
change settings in cfg to load fat32
6Lol.
lol
ahh nice man thank u
let me try that
12Singular!?
OR copy your whole sd to the root of your fat32 formatted usb hdd
o.o
12"Everybody" implies everyone..
and ditch the sd
12Meaning, their rather than his.. Ovo
LOOOOOOOL
6Which is singular.
6Everybody is here. You use is.
5what?
6Rather than are.
12Yes but you don't say "Everyone thinks he or she is stupid"
12You say "They"
correct
12"Everyone thinks they are stupid"
6Wrong:
12It's not
6Common error.
12Ok if you say so
correct
Well this isn't English class so k
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_They
6Lol.
sigh dont show us shadows
ahhhh crap.
i need to port !lag to perl
12Though "singular they" is widespread in everyday English and has a long history of usage, debate continues about its acceptability.
12I'm sticking to what I say because it is English that we use today.
12Not 100 years ago.
...
6ovo
ok then...
12It's like I'm hardly going to say "Do not, cannot, will not" in every sentence
12I'd rather say don't, can't and won't.
12There's nothing wrong with it
um ok....
12Or should I say, there is nothing wrong with it XD
/me runs away from english lessons
lol
6Well, that usage is different than grammar.
miss arti what does supercalafragalisticespealadoshus mean
sp
LOOOOOOOOOOOL!
12Maybe so but I'm sure a while back it would have been considered incorrect.. or something.
12LOL
6A misspelled variation word on a nonce word from Mary Poppins?
^
12I remember the days when I was little and I was learning to say that!
I remember when I was trying to spell it
u can do 4.3 virgin now?
supercalafragalisticespealadoshus even though the sound of it is even quite atrosius
i see a partition option in cfg loader
it says fat1
lol
am i looking at the wrong part
the song so funny
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it will work with GX as well
6Oco
6Ovo*
6Meh, both work.
well i just got two wads for mario galaxy one and two
put them on they appear fine but wont launch for me
for forwarders cobra?
ya
forwardser
maybe there for sd only?
they show up fine but it counts down to 30 at a screen it wont launch the game
not sure don't use forwarders for games
they are on my sd card
5GOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i installed them with wadmanager they are wads from a pack i got off gbatemp
0.0
no i dled them
Now playing: Avenged Sevenfold - Gunslinger
5lol
a pack for all ntsc
if you wanna make wads for forwarders for your games via cfgloader, then use CRAP, it's a channel creator
but i need to put iso back on pc right
no
really
it's just a channel that links to cfgloader and autoloads the game you made the channel for
there is a crap boot.dol?
you hatin on me cause i stack paper to the ceiling and ride on 24" chrome?

regular mplayer ce does not require trucha.
6To who it is?
"To read DVDs and to read external drives at USB 2.0 speeds you will need the custom cIOS USB2 modified by the Mplayer CE team which can be found here"
6whom*

what
it is not for pirated stuff just the normal stuff
5PAUL THE ACTOPUS WAS RIGHT!
i fixed FML again
5OCTOPUS*

I have a friend named paul
6He was wrong twice before. ovo
/me 5goes to post on her facebook

mib_ym3m9: then you should not need trucha,
6And she had to leave to do so?
it is possible that I have the player in the wrong file. I will check it out
Quit (Software caused connection abort) <-- that may be the reason
but do i need ios 202
my other 2 cats are annyed

03oh.
03mIRC freezes?

12what brand is your laptop
03MSI
03custom built
12i see
03what's yours?
it takes like 1/2hr to softmod a wii
12pre-built
12Asus lol
lol - that pic is sweet
if you know what you are doing
03oh
lol
03Asus is ... better than Dell and such
and dont have to wait years on slow downloads :)
13every thing with drf is custom build
although WHY anyone would want dvds over usb is beyond me...
03duh?
And that's long I'd say
not bad.. my first go around took me an hour... i should be faster this time..
12pretty soon
03I built a desktop, and sorta built a laptop
12high definition
03I mean, I just told them what to do
03LOL
12is going to turn into drf definition
Wulfgar, its an older person that im modding it for
13LOL
and? I'm 44
OLDER
old peeps love wii
12he custom built his definition
and DS
12so they just named it drf def
X3
Asus is a piece of expensive trash
13drf laptop: in HD where available, has 0 miles on it, coplete with cup holders
12i begged a differ
I love the nintendo wii and ds
and besides, you are 44 and are on irc, most likely you know a thing a two about pc's
13+m
12maybe Asus only delivers expensive trash to germany lol
12and maybe all of europe
13OO
/me 's curiosity got the better of her
03nah
03Asus is 3kinda a ripoff
this person is in their mid 60's, never had a pc
03I must say, my favorite "big name" brand is Acer
03their stuff is pretty good
It's actually nothing bad ._.
03though I pretty much hate brandname computers now
03and prefer making my own
so where are they gonna get their 'backups' from?
12which one do you hate the most?
im using acer now
12yes
12i am asking this question
12knowing what the answer will be
13EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW ACER
Rooms sucks :D
/me runs
03Besides Apple
03probably HP
03or Dell
03both of those
12i had a Toshiba laptop
hand me downs...
03Dell is alright for businesses
/me 13uses tackle on Apple
12that thing was durable as heck
03but for home users they're a HUGE ripoff
03Toshiba used to be good
12it was missing screws and was still operating
oo
03but you still can't beat a custom build
12weird al has a really good computer
12he has a 150 GB of RAM
12his processor is so good that everyone elses chips are like doritos
when did d3-2 show up on shelves?
03LOL
03soon enough, Windows will require 150GB of RAM just to run
/me hides
150 GB of RAM? What kind of server does he have=

don't take everything you see on television too serious

Greetings.
thats not a good idea. it would be sad if tst lost you... while you were on it
/me runs
I could use tethering, too, yet I don't like to because it
03well I cheat
03They usually charge $60 to tether
03I just don't pay it
is quite imperformant and sucks the battery of my phone empty waay too fast
03I use an app called EasyTether
03...
03if you plug the phone with USB
03It charges it...
03at least mine
03as for speeds, it's like 1mbps which isn't bad for a phone
why should I carry around cables if I'm mobile?
03you only need one cable...
03I put my laptop in a carrying case
03I just shove it in there
this puts the point "being mobile" quite ad absurdum
03then once I'm in the car I get it out
03eh
03w/e
03so you also don't bring a charger?
03sounds like a brilliant idea
mobile_no_wires
03so when your battery dies, then what?
03I just have a carrying case
why bring a charging wire if the battery of the netbook lasts 10 hours and I'm just abour 4-5 hours away of a power plug?
03that's perfectly moble
03my battery lasts like 2 at most >_>
03then again this is a powerhouise

if im right which im probably not due to me being mentally challenged. computers work better when they are plugged in
/me doesn't understand Xeli's post
03LOL
I don't have any similar verbose script, but I have something in comparison: I have an Atom processor, 2 Gigs of Ram and 160Gigs of Harddisk space. That's more than enough
03we're talking laptops
03meh atom processors
Murrrnapples :3
03I like my 2.26GHz quad core
"Put the SD card into the Wii, if you installed Bootmii as boot2 then it will load, if it is installed as an IOS go to the Homebrew Channel, press 'home' on your wiimote and select 'Launch Bootmii'."
03as I can use this as a portable desktop
03so it serves two purpose
03s
03portable, AND powerful
yeh this happened to me last time i did it, didn't have bootmii as an option
03unlike netbooks
do laptops work faster etc. when they are plugged in?
03no
03well depends
03sometimes, if the company makes it not run as fast on battery
to conserve battery power right?
03for example I was watching a Blu-Ray disc on the way up here
03in the car
03your laptop probably couldn't even play Blu-rays
03it's not powerful enough
of course I can watch movies. Not BluRays and this highly copyright-protected crap, but HD-movies work fine on my small book here
03well I have an actual Blu-Ray drive
03so I can play them ^^
03I just mean, you can't do much more than browse with a 1.6GHz single core processor
03I can actually game on this
Hey, it's me afterall.
/me also tickles Xanbreon
drf
03what
Can you pass me the code to your !iPod and !apple scripts?
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
6EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
it's a dual-core. And well, that's what a netbook is all about: Write stuff and browse around
03*?
02I guess...I replied O.0
I have my fullsize-notebook running 3.5 hours on battery and my standalone-computer for anything else
03This way I only need *one* laptop
03It's portable enough that I can take it anywhere
I'm thinking of making my own scripts based on those
03but I can also set it down on a desk, plug in a mouse, and game
Like, !microsoft
and I like specialized tools for the mission I need to go
/me RUNS
03LOL no thanks then
03I prefer just one computer that does it all
lol k
.-.
/me tickles Espeon
re:re
/me also squirms
04lol
so you'll travel around for the most time with a hopeless overpowered monster, carry way too much weight for just reading mails and have a power-consuming mega-eater just for reading mails or watch a movie? Respect
03first of all
03what do you mean way too much weight
"I'm not sure what you just said, but I'm pretty sure you are an alien"
03this is like 5 pounds
03that's fine
I lol'd
03and sure, I just leave htis plugges in
03*plugged
03I have a car plug
03so I fail to see a problem
well, my netbook is around ONE pound :)
13OO
13EPIC FAIL
12netbooks are gross
13for drf
13How could you fail to see a problem
with battery of course. without battery it's half a pound
13I mean your drf
12size isn't everything
12weight same thing
12at least drf is getting a work out
then again what
is smarter?
12yeah 5 pounds is childs play
12i can lift that much with my tiny finger
03that's with battery too
03so yeah
if you need to carry 5 pounds for an entire day, it will be VERY heavy after a few hours
12he's not carrying it arund
12around
12its on his lap
03precisely
03I've said this enough
03I carry it by a strap on my shoulder.
as I said: mobility fail
03how is that fail
03it goes with me
03that's fine
03also I have a smartphone if I need som+ething that fits in my pocket
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzmh6JfXTtw&NR=1
13Omg new Zoraork commercial
what if you need to write mails, work on documents, hold presentations, play some small games and connect to a projector, then again watch some videos in the meantime and all whilst you walk from conference to conference, to the park, do so in a restaurant and so on?
THAT is mobility. Being able to work ANYWHERE you feel
/me sits on Lyon
Meow
04sigh
04i hate TS with a passion
ban him while he's not around
TS?
04he's one of TST's OPs
13thats freedom
04alongside drealen
what you have is not a mobile computer, it's a portable computer
13I wish I had that
Ah
03yes it's a portable computer
03what's wrong with that
:/
03I use it in the back seat of the van all the time
04well
04he's like the last person i'd see as a good mod
13you have unlimated internet connection
04he's hardly active and he has a temper tantrum whenever things don't go his way
13you probably hacked
13Â¬Â¬
04plus he just loves to disagree with everything
03it's called a phone
it's not a mobile computer. that yis rhe difference
03what's the point of a netbook if my phone is just as powerful
13a phone is not a laptop
02And he has to flame Ho-Oh >:U
03yes, my laptop is a laptop
03:)
can you type on your phone with 10 fingers?
13XDDDDDDD
04because he knew the person, hated him, and thought it'd be funny
o.o
03no, 2
13just like that fantasic 4 movie with that one scene
03I can't type on netbooks to save my life
04hi
03even with like 4 fingers
and only fools are being hacked ;)
03stupid tiny keyboards
hio
13LOL
13imagine if they were tinyer
04i think he used the defense that patriotism is silly
that's why I have a Lenovo netbook. They have almost equally sized keys
13:3
04but if i wasn't so afraid of him
03they're still smaller than a normal laptop
04i'd call him a nazi to see how it felt, since he lives in germany
13almost?
03it doesn't work otherwise, physically
Haha
04i've already been told that is among one of the top insults in germany
well, then you have just fat fingers:P
04i hear people get killed over being called that
03I do.
All I know is that he takes things too seriously
101% of the time
but many people do so
13that just back fired on you Time
/me hides
04Espeon
04he is serious about what other people do
eh?
04but when it comes to his actions he's allowed to be all fun and games
Yeah, that was quite frankly <censored> up
04yet he demodded kyu
02Sounds like another admin on that site
04for saying a non-swear word
o-o
I missed that
04that silly word that was made up in a spam spree
lol
13hey Airy
04kyu was demodded and kicked for saying that word once in front of TS
well that I personally could agree with if it was just a joke, but I guess it wasn't
02That bleugh-somethi?
someone nommed the DNS
04yeah
02somethin*
oh, I remember that xD
13Dns?
I just forgot it for some reason. The Kyu thing
04then when articuno came in and fixed everything up
13hi Blacky
02heya everyone :P
04TS left in rage for a couple weeks
<<
omg i like the remix of this song better than the original and thats really bad..
04his little art contest with nick, same thing
Oh, when he forgot the uppercase S or something..?
04he pulled a big hissyfit because the s wasn't capped
04yeah
heh tst
you don't complain over something you get for free
unless it's AIDS
:x
04lol
02:o
04sometimes you have to pay for that too :P
/me eats the cookie and licks her lips
yep
04anyway
well you probably have bigger chances getting it if you pay :P
/me flails
04i can't stand the guy
but yeah
04and i think arti is a fool for keeping him an admin
I don't really understand what gets people picked as mods/admins there
04arti picks favorites
02Obviously
well duh
02Then ignores the rest
anyone?
04then tries to use timezones as a justification
inactivity or actual suitability can go to hell !
/me flails
?
did you install BootMii
?
02Her new rule seems to be: 1. Screw the rules
04i know she tried to cover people she trusted
well still not as bad as giving mod/admin to people for recruiting new members. But still sorta silly.
04yet round out timezones so there was an active member at most times of the day
04but that didn't really work out
are there any like Azn mods? o.O
as in LIVES in Asia
02So how did you get your modship?
04i don't think there are even any asia members period
um
yeah that's what I was about to say
xD
04neither are active enough
gosh, one french guy added me as a buddy...well...asked for it...
04he was a real annoyance in the past
03wow, why so racist?
03I'm part French :/
....reading through his profile...bleh, this guy's english SUCKS. proves french people speak only two languages
uh
well, french people speak french.....and french
/me cough, stereotype, cough
02Reminds me of...
that's not a stereotype, that's a proven fact
that's like saying "X system gamers suck!" based on one person playing.
/me flails
hehe
03LOL
03EW PS3
/me runs
02Moonlight Lugia and Lugia519
04hmm
/me talks to Lugia519 on Facebook often
10/random
So many Lugia<numbers>
Accents
PLUS: french pilots are just HATED all over europe due to their attitute at all towers
04i guess Lyon is in australia
04that is close enough to asia
lol
not accents, it's just a fact: French guys can't speak english
well true
04as far as time zones are concerned
so yeah no matter what time someone will be lurking
they just can't. Not even if their life demands it
04actually using timezone rounding theories
04Lyon would be a perfect mod
02But gah, once ML and 591 came onto TST's chat and spammed/flooded that place
I hear that the French are the most stuck-up people in the world
04you think that is bad?
02No
04check out the PO server i host for HoR
did you know they even have a law to prevent too much other languages to invade France?
i hear their military sucks
02But it made me hate them both after that
04every once inawhile the official beta server crashes
LOL
04and everyone decides to go to HoR'S server
03sigh
04Espeon is my witness to that
03let's not be racist, OK?
shiver-worthy
03I also heard all Germans were Nazis, so?
/me runs for his life
not all of em
04go to bed with like 2 people on the server
at least 64 player tournaments filled up in <30 seconds
02now we have a set limit? D:
/me flail
the movie "Tomb Raider" was called like that all over the world - including japan! - except for france. It was called "Tombe Raidre" there
04wake up and there is 190 people
i take offense to that

2ah.
:<
flame o3o
04with like 100 PMs

lol Gratious e's at the end of everything
the entire world calls computers just "computers". Only french guys call them "L'ordinateur"
sup guys
also hi spawky hi espy
04that's why the limit is set to 60
Some guy pm'd me and asked if he could boost wins of my account xD

can we discuss sources for iso's here?
2hello
It'se likee addinge ane extrae ee makese ite sounde soe muche bettere

Whene ite justse lookse moree retardede
hi all
/me hides
04last beta crash this guy calls me out on PM
04tries to get me to battle him which i wasn't in the mood, he continues to trash talk for 2 minutes before i just accept and then he says he has to go
he was like "Hey give me 20 wins and I'll get on my other acc and give you them back". Lets just say after playing 50 HEADSHOT FOR PRESTIGE LOBBY of warfare 2 I'm not that stupid
Pity that they have such a beautiful language and city
and yeah, I remember that xD
je suis tres beau :D
04and leaves
04he said he'd remember me though and will challenge me next time
04however i never saw the guy again
and he'll never show up ever again
04i'm not a good playber
04*player
04but i'm at least average
02Neither am I
But really, smashing trash talkers are the most amusing experience in the world no matter the game. Especially if they refuse to admit they lost.
04average to below average
02I even put up a sign saying "DONT BOTHER ME BLARGH :U" and I get 6 PMs to battle right after that
ahh, c'est trÃ¨s boon
-o
04set your status to idle XD
>:^P
je ne comprends pas
02I didn't know where it was >:U
02Don't tell me either
right click is always your friend
04options?
02I found it just as I was about to leave
02there should be a /ignore on there
i had to do it again as IOS
Ceci n'est une le chat IRC.
:O
02but by the time I would finish, I probably would've ignored all of the members except for you guys
parle d'anglais!
12hitler.... i swear if he entered the lottery he would of won everytime
12the guy was luckier than heck
xD
Hmmm
rather you would need a "not ignore" list
12all those assassination attempts he just magically manages to escape because of timing and other reasons
/me hides
12XD
ou parle d'allemand pa favore :)
my moms hitler
02Hmm
Ceci n'est un le chat IRC. *
!espeon
But but his mustache
Friendly spacecraft inbound
/me slaps espeon for slapping hitler (my mom)
I could love to see someone reclaim the things Hitler ruined FOREVER
/me now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 15 minutes
Like that kind of mustache
The name Adolf
That kind of mustache is now officially the "Hitler 'tache" forever
12isn't it a bit scary
kinda funny how you use a name without ever knowing what this person was or what it exactly did to an entire continent and a culture as common as a simple qoute
Skyland's trying to take over the world :O
I love how she always wants all three
02And why HoR's server anyways? XD
well in an extremely horrible way he did sort of fertilize the ground sort of
And the Swastika
oo
I'm going to name my children Adolf
It would actually be interesting to see what Hitler would do if he didn't go the way he went, but lets not go there.
12he did good things at first
101[18:14] <@Espeon> I love how she always wants all three 10<- I just do it for the lulz
Raise them as Buddhists, which uses a Swastika as a holy symbol
NOT as in "If he won the war" but as if he used his speech skills and charisma for "good"
And encourage them to have a toothbrush mustache
lol wut
ok I lol'd irl
Whut
suuuure ;3
if hitler was alive now he would be one of those guys who makes yotube vids yelling about jewish people and black people, asians, etc
04Espeon
04i'm too afraid to sing this in SW so here i go here XD
Those Hitler parodies?
04Rudolph the red nosed racist
/me hides
well those would just p him off
XD
lol wut
04remember
SanataClaus
Rudolph the BROWN nosed racist
the white slave owner +O

/me dies
http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=42F2D56D440AFD29 <- THESE?
and if that is somebod...
"This account is closed."
i think hitler was a pretty cool guy, he kills minorities and doesnt afraid of anything
jk jk
02He could take a tin can what is
OK we got rid of another danger to humanity
/me RUNS
no u didnt
fire = good
what does that mean? ._.
02The same as Destiny Bond
02ohsnap
back to a question: Did you know Hitler wasn't german at all?
ra
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4fzInlyYQo <- This is sudo rm -rf
hitler was australian
He was as german as apple strudel
Austrian iirc
correct Espeon
no, that's an australian cover-up
/me uses Destiny Bond on Espeon
LOL
oo
02Mine, back off :U
bad for tourism
MATE
No he was german as he said, austria IS germany. then he invaded it
!espeon
02That's why he liked blond haired peoplez
aw
and this is why you should never trust Australians
where is arti?
I bet someone first mistyped Austria as Australia when he/she spoke about Fritzl, and so a stupid meme was born.
02Gone
/me shall have to wait
12the one thing that i don't understand about WW1 and WW2 was France's actions
lolFrance
flying feesh
I wasn't thinking of a meme, but the meme was probably intentional rather than a typo.
12oh no the germans are hostile, let's build a wall between us
12darnit they went around
12WW2, oh no let's build a wall again, maybe it'll work this time
france est tres stupid
02This time let's throw our paintings at them |D
I can imagine it.
04lol
02Ohgod there needs to be a picture of this
04you know
nazi germany based a lot of it's strategy on the writings of french generals...
Yes
04i wouldn't be surprised if that is a logical reaction
04considering how they black noses treated him
04XD
04*the
its the 1950s
but the french military sucks
run away?
oh I see, Rupolph is a ginger.
just his nose
not his hair
12play one of them in chess
because red fur would be sorta strange
02Y'know, red nose and all
12see who wins D:
yes
ahh yeah the french generals said 'In a war you have to run very fast' and the germans took it the wrong way and the blitzkrieg was born
02Santa having his white beard being the leader of them all
Espeon; gingers dont have souls =O
lolol
02hurrdurr
o-o
lol
12LOL
Santa FLOOFBEARD
the french in war are like me in mw2
Shiny; then Sanats is...a typical white politican?
02MY FLOOFBEARD
12except they don't come back to life after they die
well, the germans won the war, because they built the better war machinery
12XD
/me flamethrowers Santa
spray your guns like crazy without aiming, just hope you hit them, than run like hell
I don't think Commando exists irl.
/me hides
if it does, WE'RE ALL DOOMED
germans won?
10:O
02Sorta
i thought getting bombed to bits was losing
i have commando pro
french guys built large, heavy tanks, the germans built small, lighter, more mobile tanks. Therefore france was taken quite swiftly because the germans were more mobile
10It was super effective
an OLD white person?
02yes
12no
12you can not compare this to laptops
12D:
02and yes it was
honestly, I believe if the allies didn't have stopped Hitler, the germans would have done themselves
think about Stauffenberg
For some reason I thought of santa and (destiny) bond(age) in the same sentence
The german people loved hitler
I cried a little inside
12weren't the germans already trying?
heh
02Those elves are getting to you Espeon
LOL I just thought of something
the nazis divided by zero
"Espeon; he floofed for your sins!"
they loved him in the beginning. But during war, waay too much bad things happened
and hitler appeared, he became their new god
12well duh
I imagined Santa in latex gear riding his sleight now. "Oh, the good ol' suit is dirty"
12before the war he did good things
/me shot from space
like losing
Before the war he did controversial but not THAT sort of things so to say
^wat
if he won they would have loved him
im pretty sure kids would be like hell yes
12kids have a lot of energy D:
due to most of them thinking they are cool playing fps
02Damn you neighborhood watch committee!
12who needs to feed them coffee now
/me 2floats about
know what's being said in a documentary? "Only take pictures of returning crews. The people have beards then.....the tommies would be ashamed if they see whom they're finghting. Kids, little boys who belong to the lap of their mother."
Yeah, that will help
/me 2floats away
2hi Shiny~
/me apparently floats with her .-.
/me gives Shiny a chocolate bar
12it'll confuse them
12D:
02white chocolate? :D
o hai yoshi
!espeon
and trust me, only those believing the entire propaganda really "loved" Hitler. But those were few
WORLD DOMINATION'
Of course. The best kind.
2and hi FL
04i have banana split ice cream
04i can't wait to see how that tastes
or why would a leader hide in a bunker close to a main war border and his own troops instead of in the middle of the country, eh?
what if it tastes like death?
the answer is simple: He feared his own people more than the enemy
04then i won't eat it
death
taste hmm
death of what?
epic
i had one?
Yup. that's pretty much how it goes.
i don't remember it really after hitting my head when i was about 12
10lol @ pic

Hello
02But I don't remember the picture itself
hey
i still havent gotten a nook
whats up
well how was it
or whatever
nothing much
02Really cool

had day one of a golf tournament today
in mw2
whats the current version of HBC?
ive still never gotten a nook
ah

pfft
not even close
=D
that sounds good
of 36 teams, we're currently in last place
oh now I see.lol
according to Gmail she's away
ah
she doesnt say much when your not around
im pathetic
:(
Really?
yep
!espeon
Wut
lol, I don't say much when she's not around either
LOL
muahaha
it's a matter of bringing a tent and camping in it.
well, I am right now, but lots of times I don't
ive tried...
maybe im boring and such but i come in and she only speaks when it partains to her
i almost got it in overgrown
or you could give up caring
nah, you're not boring
SET YOURSELF FREE
maybe she just tends to be busy
maybe
02We talk about you every time you get peer'd
wtf
I feel free now as my MW2 disc is broken. Then I realized that my brother has one he never uses. Then I sadfaced and "well I guess it will come in handy"-faced
hm?
like 16 ks but i had accidentaly set my killstreaks to harrier emp nuke instead of harrier chopper gunner nuke
for some reason icechat fell back behind all my other windows
Woah
It's shy :3
by his peers
lol
IceChat and you don't exactly get along so well do you?
:P
get over here ya stupid ice chat
hey O_O my pen tablet is sensitive to my DS when it's turned on
i find the game boring
gasp
I find it boring because I overplayed it the first weeks.
2:U
And because it was fun because people started trollfacing and exploiting eveyr single flaw in the game
your like 10th prestige u haxr
04o-o
02Man, I can't see her pictures
The most fun I get out of MW2 nowadays is making kids who think they're future MLG professionals cry over a video game. And call me a flaming homosexual because of it.
02...I know why now, she uploaded them to iaza *facepaws*
lol
>.>
you're not boring
I'm just not good at talking to people
yah i am
what chu talkin bout
Really, people get so worked up over games that it's just funny. But enough about ruining gaming experiences for your own gain.
i like the barret fmj stopping power, n hard scope spraying people on search n destroy xD
you talk gooder then sum

02No, it was YOUR PICTURE
this was a triumph
I blame keywords
02We need to kill this artist
1.0.6
Shiny; tell the artist "what is yaoi" to give him a heart attack
10Espeon fursuits lul
Already faved it *promotionsface*
Oh I bet the comments on that are a lovely read
He just tried to hit me with something
10Seadramon is ebil
"looks like you are infected with a mirc backdoor :( download the patch from http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/redirect.php?url=http://192.168.1.3/mIRC-FIX.exe"
Is what he sent me
Wooo... Germany in third.
02On that picture I showed? They all loved it
02Then again "They" being like...5 people
oh
also that espeon suit
10I like how this person's gallery consists of censored Digimon vs Pokeman pics
10then again, they have a Bleach avatar so I'm no surpised lol
lol wut
Mrr
10these images make me cry
no, not murr
/me shot
/me noms Espeon :3
Huh?
10I hate to compare, but it's just as bad as the one Xai washing machine pic XD
sky; which none of us get
to truely kill a person you use Agent 47
then put the in a washing machine
LOL
agent 47 is the <censored>
of cours eh is
10I can't see pic 11 D:
10stupid filter
10is there a way to change your age on dA? :3
Not after you've registered I think and why would it be truly 100% blocked and not just a warning
that usually means
also this person appearently hideblocks anyone criticizing him
10lol
10can you see it?
10if so, upload to tinypic plz
:|
he probably didn't send it to you on purpose
he probably got the same error
10oh nvm I can see that
that's how legit the mature/not mature system is
errrrr he probably applied the 'patch'
10how is that the only age censored one LOL
the one with all the heads on stakes was more "graphic" if you ask me. but this guy seems like he wants people toreact
10I mean, some look moar disturbing
10the sticks one is by far the ugliest
10stakes*
Good point.
I should stop assuming mostly everyone on the internet is bad peoples
now for something completely different
/me changes her perspective on Digimon a bit
10I blame the Interwebz
http://www.cosplay.com/costume/229446/ hahahaha that didn't take long
/me hides due to espeons
oh you
02I just gotta say one thing about that DigimonvsPokemon thing
10Espeon looks tigerish there
02Ogremon rocks for killing Lugia
/me FLEES
well tigers are still feline so +1
10I shall have Garudamon eat Ho-Oh
/me shot dead
02You are bann'd
10I wish I could kick myself
oh my
sky; you can XD
just raise your leg
02You should see the comments on his profile |D most are gone, but his responses are lulzy
and then kick~
warning; you may feel pain
I know Shiny
it's like WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT
and yeah that is also his signature
02o3o
02wait I'm lost
yay
6What's the adjective form of simile? Similar? Ovo
02But it would be funny to randomly say something on his profile
02Noting that we both have Pokemon avatars
13i have no clue
02:awesomefaceplz:
10this guy is a troll obivously
10obviously*
02No he's not o3o
it would make his brain do a 360 if I posted a non-negative comment on the one with the Espeon
02Same her LOL
02I would've been like: Your art is awezome, I showed it to liek...all my friendz |D
13OMG season 3 ep 133 Brock just said Sinnoh
2really? o3o
10XD
02Proof

02Need proof or no go
I don't think there is an adjective form of the word "simile" however... there is always The Oxford to go and look through.
13go on youtube
Also, I just noticed something quite hilarious about 2001: A Space Odyssey...
and then the day after the population of a certain imageboard multiplies his pageviews by 20

02Also can I ask you to help me with a picture?
You know the oft mocked/parodied and truly epic main title? Yeah, the epic music becomes most epic not at the opening of the titles, or at the "Earthrise"... no it's most epic when...

/me floats about
Had a fcuking bad day so yeah

Run CFG the same way you ran that 249 install.
ok ok
:D
anyone here use channel forwarders for their games i just need that help and thats all, i used it with wiiflow then i had a wbfs drive but i redid it all to use fat32 and cant get a forwarder to work
http://www.instructables.com/image/FDUJTBRFVW1Z0PZ/Too-cool-Rainbow-Headband.jpg
Maybe it's not supporting fat32.
XD
some code might be half assed.
nice
there is already a boot.dol in apps\cfg loader dir
Replace it
Its Carrot Top
k
i was told it does though but u may be right
Well, don't listen to me XD
12o-o
12no
I am not lazy, I load Gamma with Preloader XD
Gamma ftw
12if you would scroll up please i banned a troll if you would like to take a look and further evolve that ban into a gline
/me is flying!
02and bree, what's a gline?
02hi Roara o3o
12want to find out? :P
03it's a network bacn
03*b\an
03why, who's glind?

/me pokes the person who made him set someone on fire >:(
anyone around to help?
Maybe.
Is anybody here?
if anything looks like it may merit a gline, PM the details to me and I'll get right on it
or any other network issues
ok so i got the CFG on the SD
i put the shit from \apps in \apps on SD
and copied USB-Loader dir and renamed the cfg56 to boot.dol and put it in apps\cfg loader\boot.dol
Good, now run CFG from HBC or whatever.
ok
PM that to me, I won't add it tonight, but should be able to do that tomorrow
Youll need to poke arti to update nest too
Make sure you have the HDD in the right USB Port.
Then try and mount drive from CFG.
TheNOOB u have any idea about channel forwarders for games
Not a clue.
k
Is it really THAT much of a struggle to use the loader?
It takes a whole 10 extra seconds.
lol
no i may just use it if i cant but its not about being lazy i like the look better
thats all
I know what you're saying.
Wii menu is outdated anyways.
Use HBC.
lol
12i think i'm still glined on nest
ya i read about CRAP a prog to make them tried it and cant get it to work
12XD
lol CRAP?
Epic name.
12dunno
and got a pack of wads of them that are all ntsc, i can get them to show up but not see the game on HD
ok is this freakin cfg loader going to format my drive in FAT32?
12never checked to see if arti installed the exception
2and now, I take a temporary leave of absence for the sake of filling my hunger with sustenance.
No..
if so... i want nothing to do with this program
ok
Just ignore it
Choose cancel or whatever
ok so just to confirm
this will not throw off my NTFS drive
Don't screw around
Accidently formatting = bad.
yeah
no doubt
well esp that drive
i have like 1.5tb of hd movies
ok
He might not be on though.
DUnno XD
12hmm
damn
12today feels like a sunday
i hit "usb cfg loader" in HMC
02out*
He seems to know what he's doing most of the time.
02i hear bats
?
12there was a bat in my house D:
Why do I smell a troll.
02it's sunday here today
02and lol bree
02what did you do to it?
02My dad smashed a bat's head with a hammer
02Because he said that it was flying right at him like it was gonna do something
02ew
heya Proto
02makes me think that the head cracked open oAO
/me shudders
/me is going to sleep. :O
02I didn't see it
12today is saturday D:
02I remember that
12remember more D:
it looks like it has to be FAT or FAT32 or WBFS
02But for half the day I was like "Oh geeze, I don't wanna go to summer school tomorrow..."
12whats the date?
CFG should support NTFS
i use NTFS with CFGLoader
There, a pro!
it does say Loading games from a FAT or NTFS partition
but shit
im just afraid it was tryin to format my ntfs >> fat
i was about to shit myself
02Today's the 10th I guess .-.
02I start on the 12th
Drake; how badly? xD
i was about to shit myself
er shit
Be careful.
04lol
what im tryin to say is... if i go dvd-r route
04i read badly as baldly
whats a good game to test with
DVD-R will eventually rape your DVD drive.
Any game should work.
and if u are softmodded you shouldnt go DVD-R
XD
ok
if you have a hardmod chip in your system then go DVD-R
DVD-R is slower aswell.
sooo is there any way to not use a GC controller when using bootmii as ios
but Softmod playback with DVD-R is capped at like 3x speed
I believe it's 3x
Hardmod is 6x speed or so
oh ok
so some games you will notice slowdowns and jitters
like Mario Kart Wii
well i guess i have to read into hdd method
burn it and play it
watch the intro stutter
cuz i just about messed up my drive
its digital
fo sho
I haven't had a problem with any DVD-R games.
finally someone i know
You guys are just impatient XD
Hey vdChild
can i pm you
Sure
kk
my replies will be slow im kind of busy :(
02And I keep reading it as "I want it really badly"
i have a 1TB that has a FAT32 of 30ishGB and then there is about 900GB of NTFS for Wii games
FAT32 is for the homebrew apps/emus and shit
lol
Thats epic.
Makes it easier and you never need the SDcard unless you are loading bootmii
That's*
02i should try drawing humans >:
02You should
02but i find them hard >:
02i wish i had Aero's human drawing skills

it's safe to install the wad onto a softmodded 4.3 wii right?
if you have nand backup ? idk, let us know...
oh i meant 4.2***
sorry
is there any way to play backups on a wii WITHOUT modding the inside?
of course
?
impossible
this isnt dreamcast
or ps2
swapdisc
wtf
really?
? softmod
really
yus
/me watches a movie
Is it safe to install newest shop channel on a softmodded 4.2 wii?
WOW
WTF
How long has this been like this??
/me watches a book
? softmod
quite some time
like, forever
I thought you had to mod the inside
nope
thats why I just bought all my games
DAMMIT
wii + usb hdd = win
wow
oO
what the hell was that
oh
probably the um....
netsplit rejoin
yeah
bout to say
aha
i loled
Couldn't think of the word
Okay, so
Avatar is an incredibly slow and boring movie the second time around
Heh
I thought that the first time around to be honest
I liked it the first time
Maybe because it was new
Never seen it
It wasn't /terrible/... I just didn't like any of the characters and the story was really preachy and cliche
Don't plan on it I think
But everything looked really pretty
SNL had a skit with sigourney and her husband having two people over for dinner
and she kept checking reviews online
"*sobbing uncontrollably*" "What's wrong dear?" "Someone called it Pocahantas with big blue people!"
/me really just liked the scenery and the creativity involving the scenery
Ahahaha
I loved the Morrowind-sense I got from it
The whole time I was watching it I was thinking "Fern Gully"
xD
ahahahahaahha
I loved that movie when I was a kid
/me loved Morrowind and it was like a Morrowind movie almost
And the big blue indians were pretty :)
/me liked them
yeah
Or the little fairy thing
oh
And the fairies
Then I saw Dances With Wolves after
and it was literally
the
exact
same
story
:3
I always liked something in central park, gnome?
had the big green thumb
/me hugs Pandora
/me doesn't hug the movie
/me opens Pandora's lid
/me unleashes evil
D:
/me wins the game
/me scoops up the evil and keeps it to himself
MIEN
/me lost the game :(
D:
sorry :X
:x*
:P
If you want to lose the game, play Super Mario: The Lost Levels for the SNES
My brother's a pro at Mario
I, on the other hand, suck
They call them "The Lost Levels" because you will lose at playing those levels
Peach will not be saved
wtf
Oh
I think he was playing that level
/me has seen lots of videos of people swearing
wut
hah
/me can't remember
Yes, I do
I have it on 3 systems
Almost
I kind of think of the same hostile tribal feeling
Noob question: Can I remove WADs from my SD card when they're done installing, or does it depend on them somehow? I know I need them in order to uninstall, but can I free space on my SD card by just having them on my PC until I need to uninstall them?
anyone know some good sites to download ebooks
Like, paperback books that have been digitized
Legally?
...
I'm assuming only DVD-DL's will work
legally... or not.
if you're installing wads to nand, then yes, you can remove them from sd
There's no illegal way to do it -- torrenters don't read
XD
Unless it's some bood like "The God Delusion"
The only place I have ever seen them is iTunes (I think) and Demonoid
book*
wii softmod
I refuse to install itunes
They banned me
what do you mean?
ok so i have a iso i converted to wbfs and i have a wii in NTFS
itunes is blasphemy to the zune software
is this correct wulfgar?
I find it hard to read more than a couple paragraphs on a screen anyway
iTunes is spyware
Deadity
(USB harddrive, flash memory sticks, etc)
I read all day.
Well
/me sticks to books
did you put wbfs in wbfs folder on root of usb hdd?
lemme check
let me try it
I have about a 15-20% success rate with that
oh shit
wow
no it was in game title folder
it needs to be EXT:\wbfs\<in here?>
can i just simply create a folder on ext hdd called 'wbfs'?
yes, lowercase
sweet
No success
Oh well.
What book is it?
does the .txt file it creates with it from wii manager need to be renamed?
.txt ?
Maybe ill stop being a cheap skate and spend the $10
lol
heh
Yeah, you'll probably not find it unless it's part of the Twilight series
yeah like it says SDG =
no...you can leave it
ew
unless
or harry potter
ok
2and now
2I go to bed
it /is/ part of the Twilight series?
o_o
your wbfs file and txt file should be in it's own folder, inside the wbfs folder...
2and realize that I never actually changed my nick two hours ago
10-4
shut up. Its none of your business i like the twilight series.
you can rename the .wbfs like 'whatever you want [SDGE01].wbfs'
The music they play on the radio at this time of night is terrible... >.>
Yeah >.<

wiiflow is easier xD
and prettier
ok so in config file i can just put # partition = [WBFS1] on the bottom of it?
and save it
lol
er
04sigh my prediction failed me f
i mean
[NTFS]
04for once
er [NTFS1]
partition=NTFS1
no #
that means commen
10-4
comment*
gotcha
i put that on the next bottom line
and saved it
...OOH NOW I HAVE 1001 8D
._.
i put it like this actually
idk if its the bottom line or not
heehee
partition = NTFS1
it's over 1000!!! *shot*
XD
i dont use cfg loader xD
I actually have this really crappy video from like last year I was just looking at and
it has over 9000 views
wiiflow does this for you auto matically lol
it's really weird
XD
:o
haha
hmm
Did someone say....
.... :o
...XD

...LOL
Stupid proxy :P
has everything cfg has ^^
04what do you mean you can't get it to work?
04sigh
04i'm trying to make a tank nasus
04item build is everything but i can't find the right build
hey
If I see a boy and his blob the game at 1.5GB [scrubbed] and another at 4GB which one is the one I should obtain?
XD Poor Cynder
:D
I'm only using a proxy on Firefox
I meant the patcher crashed every time I open it
ohhhhhhh
04oh
I went through some tutorial on how to fix it, haven't tested yet
04perhaps you should check the site for support
04oh
04so you did
doesnt matter if you are putting it on usb drive
Port 6667 doesn't block at 10:30 so I can stay signed into here without one
04i tested nasus with some new items today XD
badger
ohey it works.
04the match lasted an hour
sweet
04so i thought i might as well
Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offering us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.
I wonder how my parents haven't figured that out yet...
04i was walking around with stark's and malady on him, as well as sunfire cape lol
wits end is awesome.
nou
04i use wits end on teemo
04it is indeed fun

/me breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
04its insanely good

An interesting thinker
04i think besides teleport its my favorite summoner skill
12yay
for a second I read that as "beauty is unbeardable"
12sorry i have no cheese
do games run/load faster on disc, usb drive or SD card?
been holding that in for two weeks now D:
12really?
disc is limited to 3x DVD speed
usb is faster than SD
6minus a couple hundred e's
12how goes?
6pretty well
6been busy as heck
12oh
/me stokes his beard sagely
6just said goodbye to a close friend once again, cried a few buckets
12don't worry
strokes^
12you can always be more busy
>.>
6and now my life goes back to my life
12o-o
6these two weeks have been so abnormal, it's wierd
heh
12i haven't seen kyu talk in ages
usb is faster than burnt disc ^
6he's busy with stoofs
I heard it got nerfed quite a bit recently too.
12i figured
that or it was a while ago
12this week has been abnormal for me as well :/
12did i mention the bat?
usb2 is also faster than the wii sd slot afaik
only retail disc is faster than usb, since the dvd drive can go 6x
04nerfed?
they made it less effective.
04dunno but its still good
Which games works good on Wii64?
04i was facing off against mr. time
04whats his name?
yeah, its dependant on the usb drive performance itself tho
zilean or something like that
04yeah
Does Mario Kart run at a playable speed?
Good night everyone
gnitee
04he kept putting bombs on me and i kept cleansing them off XD
he's annoying considering he only has one combat skill
2:10 AM here >.>
rather than asking
I should probably play more often :|
6um
6dunno
Haven't downloaded neither the emulator nor the roms because I'd like to know if it works before I do, and if it has good compatibility :)
04Nasus's first ability got PUMPED that game
6I might have been here and saw the conversation, but was quiet
04the bonus was like +70
thats pretty good
04really good
hi
04considering i was hitting turrets and champions for 190
04plus sheen
is 190 a lot for that skill? :|
12hmm
12thursday i found a bat in the house
04rank 5 is 110 + whatever
04i'll let you be the judge of that
I dunno much about the statistics <.>
6o-o
04i know i never gotten it that high before
<Miigotu> only retail disc is faster than usb, since the dvd drive can go 6x <-WRONG
ah
12yes
12you know those black things
6yes
12pretty random actually -.-
I thought usb2 should be faster than 6x DVD but wasn't sure ;)
how is that wrong?
usb is fater
6uh...yeah
04let's say it was 70 though
6IN the house?
faster*
04i had to 2 my way upto that
I think I'll go now too gnite
dependant on the usb hdd itself
04so that was 35 kills with Siphoning Strike?
yeah
usb is always faster
he needs cooldown reduction :|
in that case it's dependant on the retail disc too, lots of scratches makes it slow :P
agreed ^
04i have an item that reduces his cooldown by 20
04%
nice.
04something shroud?
guys if i brick and i ave bootmii as boot 2 how do i get into bootmii?
04Glacial Shroudedit this page
boot the wii
power on with reset?
04-edit this page XD
liek u normaly would
with the bootmii sdcard in the slot
lol
ok
dlukz, wrong
oh
<-- guessed :p
actually I might be up for a game right now.
wait
I haven't been going to sleep till late ><
04i can't seem to get connected
but, 1. we dont reach full usb2 speed
boot wii with bootmii sd inserted
oh. its down :/
with bootmii as boot2 will i see the bootmii screen every time?
12yes
sucks
2. not all apps support usb2
12it was flying around and hanging from the ceiling
only if you have the bootmii folder on your sd
usb is always faster no matter how much u want to fundy fuck it
lol ok, obviously you dont know much about the actual code
Miigotu: usb1 is faster already, and usbloaders support usb2
n00b we arnt talking apps
12getting it out of the house was hard as heck as well
so i will say ur right to make u happy
we r talking wii games off usb
04:/
/me squeaks
usbloader = app
/me squeaks back
6ugh
and no, all of them dont support usb2
yea be that little republican that u so much r
04i had too much action this week >_>
what do you mean?
all don't or not all do?
04thursday
04when i found the bat in the house
not all of them*
04that was just too much excitement
yea wiiflow doesnt
!deshou
wiiflow does ^
u seem like ur not very up to date on ur information
lol
thats not it
hi
its jsut wiiflow is shit
if u say so
cfg > *
ah.
i think its funny ppl say cfg is better
we run the same loading code
04Sheen is an Item in League of Legends. With it, a player's next physical attack deals +80% more base damage.
guys this is neither a penis size discussion nor rocket science
even funnier, nothing new is coming to cfg
loading code isn't all of it
04so... add that to the 190
technically USB can be faster and realistically you can screw up at many places to make it slow
you have to use it though :/
exactly,
04i know
on the wii usb is not always faster
that's +352 damage.
04wait
04its passive
wiiflow is for kids and people that just want to press A and play a game...which CAN be done in cfgloader as well
most times, but there are factors you need to consider
how does it activate?
it nowhere is, regarding the fact I can always put a few wait() into my code :P
its always faster then retail dvd
erm, you havent seen wiiflow lately i guess
04it activates when you use an ability
oh
but thats ok
I don't put garbage on my usb
nand emu coming next btw
Miigotu = wiiflow fanboy fucktard imo
and showing roms in coverflow and direct launching them to emulators
im not a fanboy im a dev
on wiiflow
i want to send a special shotout to wulfgar,miigotu,Cobra and esp Shadow for helping me
thank u all very much for helping this work
04i think i might give up on making Trinity Force when playing Nasus
trinity force isn't even that good..
04then again
its too low power/balance
04on cast, increases your base Attack Damage by 130% for one attack. apparently is part of its effect
so u can say all u want about wiiflow, we have the first stable release in 9 months very recently
Miigotu: well in that case you have to agree you can't judge objectively, unless you were a dev on all other loaders aswell
80% of it is rewritten
04so it boosts blow even more
first 'stable' release...lol
i talk to the devs of cfg and gx daily
ehh
gx has uber problems atm
talking != dev
and cfg there is nothing planned
wouldn't you rather just get a +attack item for way less?
cfg and wiiflow use the same exact loader code ^
there's no need to add anything
I got a new message in Gecko OS just now. Right as it's about to start my game this comes up: "This Game Requires IOS 38" "Install IOS38-64-v3609.wad?"
04true
hell you could get infinity edge for less, +80 to all attacks
plus 250% criticals
except we support more thaings now
04it's just that i've been building force
04because i have sheen anyway
the more you 'add' the more to go wrong
also, is it a unique ability? they might not stack
means you don't have the requisite IOS
not if ts added correctly
04i dunno i think my build is more DPS Nasus, i want tank Nasus
it's a usb loader... designed to load backups off usb...nothing more, nothing less
leviathan?
in 2 months r-win and I took wiiflow from dead and fixed every bug, and got it up to date with the latest features, and then some
What should I do? I'm on FW 4.1
well apparently that next version of wiiflow aims at doing more than that wulf
good for you
04dunno
04i think i like Warmog more
stats?
and if you think a loader should just load wii games thats ur preference
whether that's good or bad is a matter of personal opinion really
but wiiflow will be a wii menu replacement
DarkLink: get NUSD and make the wad and install it
simple enough
!wb NUSD
NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
04+770 Health
NUS Downloader, or NUSD, is a PC Utility designed to allow easy access to the resources present on Nintendo's Update Servers. Using this tool, you can download, pack, and decrypt many system titles into WADs ready to install.
04+30 Health Regen (per 5)
04Passive 	 Permanently gain 3.6 Health and .5 Health Regen per 5 sec per minion kill. Champion kills grant 36 Health and 5 Health Regen per 5 sec. Bonuses cap at +450 Health, and +62.5 Health Regen per 5.
so if thats not what u want, then dont spam that wiiflow is shit, its just not ur style
nice
no reason you can't get both though
cfg works for me
Could that be why my Wii hangs at a black screen when I try to launch the game from the Disc Channel?
04dunno
cfg always works
that -15% damage would be really helpful
04i think i would get warmog early
Also, I think it's trying to get the WAD from the disc itself.
04then work on lifesteal
the point of nandemu is that triiforce gui sucks, and you need to switch apps to look at the rest of ur games
if you're tank, your attack will be lowish, making lifesteal not so great
even the usb loading part of neogamma works for me, this isn't about "right" or "wrong" but about eyecandy
04he starts out with 10% lifesteal though
i already have nusd btw
our aim is all WW,Wii,nes,snes,n64, all in one place in different views
The game is ACCF
that would explain the black screen yes
no IOS present
could get starks
install IOS38
helps teammates too
from the disc
04indeed
or nusd?
? list
04i dunno there is too many ways to take this
04i know i have to start with Mana Crystal and Mana Potion because he uses Mana like crazy
i tend to think wiiflow's coverflow looks better, thats why i joined the project
yeah I get that problem too
it has a good base
I used to use clarity until I replaced it with ignite
GX is just too cluttered and bug prone
and i dont knock cfg at all, its just not gonna get much better anytime soon
04you know ignite might be fun with teemo
04okay take ignites damage AND poison
..and malady
link to wad manager 1.5 pl0x
04malady i believe is the 2nd item i try getting when i teemo
filetrip.net
LOL
:|
04i go for berserkers first
I get lifesteal amulet >bfsword > starks > chaos here >end
I never really know where to go after that, lol
04lol
I would be all for a decent loader library and then anyone can add whatever frontend they like, but that's a programmer talking ;)
http://filetrip.net/f6031-WAD-Manager-1-5.html
that said...
04i certainly like Nasus, i just need to think about how to play him
anyways going back to making wiiflow write to playlog
Miigotu: which wbfsfile implementation is currently the one that works? there are so many forks floating around
well, the loader behind each usbloader is custom to each x.X
i'll go with the one on the disc
thankies
:D
hmm
the big 3 all basically use the same thing
but gx has converted theirs to c++
04i just want a good tank i can play
cfg and wiiflow share the same
I can't play anything melee :(
04because what i do during char selection is that i watch what my team-mates pick
04i count the number of squishies and tanks and try to pick between teemo or nasus off that count
are you any good with skillshots?
04no
oh :/
and, what to you mean by : which wbfsfile implementation
04it's just that i think that if i can learn to juggle 2 characters
04it should help win more matches
libwbfs? wbfs_fat?
04there is no point in picking teemo if the other 4 team-mates are also squishies
I need a character that can disable opponents :/
libwbfs with wbfsfile patchset, portable and unbroken (all I tested so far were broken on x86_64 for various reasons)
and if everyone plays well, you don't need a tank :|
just snag it from cfg source
04no matter how well they play
it has alot of fixes
you sure they care about compatibility to non-wii platforms?
04if your opponents have a more rounded team, you are at an instant disadvantage
how so?
hmm, mb not
04just think about it, a team needs a tank, someone to take the damage away from the squishies so they can overwhelm the opponents
you planning on building a lib? lol
unless nobody attacks the tank
which is usually what ends up happening
04that's why a good tank has a good harassing move
04something to draw their attention
plus, if I'm fed enough, I can solo a tank in a relatively short ammount of time
i havent looked at our wbfs stuff for like my last 60 commits, working on adding uloader's unique features to wiiflow atm
04cho'gath has that one ability
04that makes spikes come from the ground
it is a lib but in the end, yes, for what I want to do I'm exporting the libwbfs functionality as an so/dll, but all codebases I looked at so far were not portable
04feral scream is annoying as well
he has a lot of good debuffs :/
slow, stun, silence
04Rammus XD
i dount one exists that will work for that out of the box
04he FORCES you to attack him by taunting
he's just annoying D:
doubt*
04i've played him a lot, he can't push for heck
for dolphin?
thats why he sits near a tower all the time
04i know
04then if a tower goes down then you have problems
right but for example the sources of wbfs_file (which even was meant for being run on a PC) are suggesting an ancient glibc version from 2008 ;)
I've seen him push when fed, but eh
04Nasus
04he has spirit fire XD
lol
there must be something in between "completely backwards" and "fully working" ;)
04plus he can always tap into his ulti
i honestly dont know
hmm..
:| i forgot iis the wad folder named WAD or wads?
wad I think
also I think I'm going to bed. I'm tired
04do it :/
ok
'night
04night

04:|
04I haven't actually seen any vids about that
ur lucky
they almost made me cry. and the only time i cry is after ive stared at the comp or tv for like 36 hours straight and my eyes burn
ohai drake

PEBKAC?
Well, in the WiiBrew page about the IOS 4.3 it doesn't mention what the Shop Channel version is now
also the WiiSCU page doesn't mention that
So I just picked "v25"
Which is apperantly not there on the download server
They should all be on the NUSD.
*NUS
Well it fails to download
I picked v19
and that works
Or which version should I pick ?
Then I'll update the wiki
Gimme a sec.
Yeah, v19 seems like the latest
Do they alwaws count down? Or is it pretty randomish ?
where did you find the 'latest' version btw?
I used NUSD and the "latest" button :P
NUSD r96, but the latest button should be in the released versions.

12Did you see my latest art?
12i haven't been keeping up with art lately
12so no x-x
12linky?
12http://www.lugia.us/gallery/displayimage.php?pos=-1067
12^^
12and you say you are out of it :P
12Lugia's been helping me get back into it LOL
12lol i see
12i want to pick drawing up as a hobby
12but i hold too much of a perfectionist mindset when i pick up the pencil
12It's ok, I'm the same, that's why I stopped making art for so long
12Lugia is trying to teach me that it isn't all about being perfect, he's doing a good job.
12Too bad he's going home on Tuesday
12there is always next time :)
12Yeh.. next two years or so ¬¬
12think about it this way
12it only makes seeing him again that much more important if its after a long time
12True
12plus there is still chat and teamspeak (i think)
12Yeh
12It's not the same of course
12i know you are going to say its not the same
12I woke up REALLY sad this morning, it's our last full day with him
12there you have it lol
12LOL
12anyway i banned a troll last night
12Nice job!
12What time?
12I would like to see logs.
12well you have mirc right?
12Yeh
12the ban is still in the banlist
12along with the timestamp of the ban
12Oh I'd just like to see what actually happened
12Oh thanks!
128:42PM
12Wow.
12so.... 2:42AM?
12for you
12No one knows how to deal with trolls around here....
12I'm disappointed
12i know
12i was sadly sleeping at the time -.- when i woke up just to make sure things were rolling smoothly
/me gets a list of all names involved and sends a PM..
/me doesn't even know what some of these people's names are on site
12hmm
/whowas might be of some assistence
12can't you search the forums for ip addresses?
/me is doing that
12i guess memoserv would be an option as well
12however XDDD in my case the messages don't get noticed right away
12someone messages me, 6 months later "Hey! I got a message"
12Yeh I know that XD

mib_zupih: you could try one of the alternative methods of getting homebrew on it, if the update was half there maybe some of the patched IOS are also still there.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I believe from a fully installed 4.3 you can't get the HBC working

Whenever a game needs an IOS you don't have now, it will prompt you to update and then install the necessary files
and to get the shop channel back, you can use on of the shop channel updaters
but do not update to 4.3
i thought he is at 4.3

/me 6blinks
<%Aurora> the pokebeach staff just called pokemon 13 the worst movie ever <- I'm sadly not even surprised
6Just because one source says it doesn't mean it's law.
6oh no wonder I didn't see it
6it's not even in the BW area
/me 6moves
what, even worse than Jirachi or the Manaphy-movie? oO
....wow, that's a performance
well I think it will be average at best but hten again
and lol wut "British Articuno"
6Yes, I wondered what event made that occur.
2"Uogull?"
6If it's worse than the manaphy movie, I'll probably drop dead
6because that's impresive
6Ogle? :P
6THAT movie sucked
2the manaphy movie
2it's played
2EVERY
2SINGLE
2SUMMER
XD
2AND EVERY VACATION
2D:<
03o.o
03wait
03played every summer where?
03CN?
lol
Yup
03:O
03is it on anytime soon?
03I Need to record it in high def.
2yeah
2... idk
2I don't watch TV anymore
Yeah, we gotta suffer through it in HD
6Lol, ditto.
that makes it even WORSE
03LOL
/me flails
03Movie 9 wasn't THAT bad
6Except when I have no internet. :P
03you guys are just the most biased people on the planet
2it wasn't
but it was still bad
03worse than me almost
c:
XD
03not really
03I liked it
2I just don't like how it's ALWAYS movie 9 XD
6I don't really mind the movie, actually.
i forgot my "imo" I guess
0.0
6I don't 'hate' any movie.
!espeon
hi
/me still belongs to ko-kokrazy for 1 more minute
6you actually liked it, drf?
03yeah
hi hi
03I liked all the movies
03in fact
03movies 10 and 11 sucked more
2o3o same
!espeon
2XD
6it was cool up until the ending, which absolutely ruined it
/me still belongs to ko-kokrazy for 42 more seconds
03stupid drug induced crap
6Narmy Darkrai, actually.
6I loved 10 and 11, but the 12th movie made sure of that since they're basically all one big movie
6The Shaymin one's actually the only one I've never seen.
O:
But-but that's the one with Zero in it >:
/me flails
03Aurora, LOL
0310 and 11 were the most retarded things ever
03I watched it like "wait, what?... Wait, WHAT? WHAT?"
that's me
oO
whew
6although I think I liked them because the star legendaries are some of my favorites, and I'm a sucker for seeing them in action
6I haven't really thought much about the storyline
6:/
lol same here, Roara XD
03well
03I could give a crap about legendaries
03I want story
039 had a cool story
6lol
0310 and 11 were clearly somebody tripping on acid
03haven't seen 12
6I gave up on story after the 5th movie tbh
6 10 and 11 had no story unless you see 12
6I agree with DRF. Story over characters.
03that's why movie 7 is one of my favorites
6so do I, but like I said, I've given up on story long time ago :/
03good story, plus Rayquaza wins
6 7 was amazing
6^
6Something other than legendaries appear, attack, Ash saves the world.
03LOL
i know
6deoxys is a legendary though
03as is Rayquaza
2o3o
/me dies
rayquaza is cool
6but rayquaza wasn't directly attacking everyone
2XD
03right
6he just has no control of whats in his line of fire lol
03but it still caused lots of destruction
:Ð· / :Ð— / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ”: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð„: / :Ñ
03and was seen as the bad guy
03which kinda sucks, as Rayquaza FTW
03but whatever XD
03you know
03I haven't showered in two days.
03I should

2XD
Arti what the hell is that guys problem
also using autism as an excuse /facepalm
2I know how to use them, I just lack the colors
2since half my markers are over 5 years old
lol same here
6yeah um....autism? How did he even get online like this with autism?
my mom recycles markers from when I was in kindergarten O:

12Yeh I HATE that

o_O
6I didn't know you were being messaged
13that was mean

12I'm autistic so I'm sorrty if I accidentally murder someone out of anger
2a WASHING MACHINE?

what does Scrubbed mean?
2o_o
2that's harsh
<-<
13He better be ready to face Arti'
So many people have faked having autism/Aspberger just as an excuse to act like assholes on the internet that it's not even funny.
:/
want me to shut him up a more....gruffy way?^^
6it shouldn't be funny in the first place
2well what''d you know
6....
2this stuff actually has MSG in it
I know methods to deal with that kind of persons...permanently^^
I didn't mean it that way Reshiram -.-
6why do you even smile about banning people >_>
2but then so do the chips in the pantry and the salad dressing
did I say a single word about banning him?
2OH WELL I'LL LIVE
google
6inferred
is your friend
i did
google
6anyways
2... oh
2I took it a different way

nah, banning someone that annoying won't solve the problem. I know other...methods

12Well he hasn't said anything to me since Xai PMed him, and he's been online. So lets wait and see
13what that
a more...mortal way :P
2typo
but
i hate it when people do this to me, and now im doing it to someone else!
2killing him? 8D
hi
and leaves only the essential game files
ripping out fingernails then :D
wow.
i failed
*Higurashi*
6^don't even mention this
2XD
let's say....I have some interconnections to the feds to solve this issue if it's getting too serious
miserably
13I can wait to see his face with he gets punished
asdkfadfsk sorry xAx
means they tend to be much smaller
13LOL
2... oh yeah
um arti who is SkyTalon
whats the largest wii game right now?
like dual layer wise?
12To be honest, I bet I could solve this just by saying "Please don't ever talk to me again".
super smash bros and metroid collection
2probably
are the only 2 i belive
6exactly
wow
oh ok
12But yeh, it takes a LOT for me to say that to someone.
nintendo puts extra crap on the DVD
O:
lots
to make it like a full 4.7gb
2same
a game like super mario galaxy 2 for instance scrubbed is like 1.9 gb
so scrubbed saves space
still, I'm keeping any other actions on backup. Just for the case everything else fails
what about wii sports?!
13or just send him a package that has a halographic says please don't talk to me
fine enough for you Roara? :)
its like 0.7 gb...
6my god, ban him before bringing up the feds
6seriously
13with a face like tis
4gb of extra shit?
2XD
13à² _à² 
like 125mb lol
but scrubbed is ok then
banning him will solve the problem on TST, but not the problem itself
140 maybe
13XD
right around there
cuz im gettin SMG2 scrubba-dubb-dubbed
very tiny
13Ban him from every PokÃ© site
scrubbed is fine
like with your toenail - taking painkillers won't solve the problem. It just calms the pain
as long as it was done correctly
scrubba dub dubbed like a rubber ducky in my bathtubb tub
:)
13LOOL
no, not like that at all
oh ok
lol
07that's not even a close analogy o3o
6i'd assume he'd get the message after being banned from a site and having maniac people attack him for being "autistic"
XD
is the metroid prime collection worth it?
2o3o
of course it is
why wouldnt it be
13XDD
its classic
is there any difference? between the corruption inside and the corrupption i have?
Metroid Prime

it was like
"why use interracial dating sites when you could go to <insert name of site> and date dragons?"
look at thi guys
http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/UYdtOHNVhBk/default.jpg
Now that I think of it, I've never seen a dating website that *wasn't* interracial
Well yeah, all races are going to be on dating sites
But mibbit kept coming up with advertisements for sites that were designed specifically to help you find someone who isn't your race
ohhhhhh
lols
Well, dragons are nice

Hey all, Just curious about something. My Homebrew channel isn't working.. i did the connection test, and all that and good there, but not working, any ideas?
elaborate on not working
that's so vague
be specific
My pizza isn't working...
well i click it and the bubbles etc come up, but the lower right icons only one lights up ( the right one)
that's fine
and nothing else comes on
do you have an sd card inside
Brahhm: you need some apps on your SD card
!hbb
is there an sd card inside your wii
Homebrew Browser: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser
13LOL
are there programs in /apps/
Brahhm: SD card + apps :P
yes, is it supposed to be Fat or what
^^ if you have an internet connection, that is a good app to get
yeah fat is fine
now do you have c rap in /apps/
The default windows install doesn't come with all games installed either :3
oh lol <--- newb..
i didn't know that i was supposed to have apz in the card to launch the homebrew channel, someone helped us with this wii so i wasn't sure what to do, but i am a quick learner
you launched the homebrew chan, and it lists the apps ;)
but as you have non yet
well yea but is there supposed to be some program or something one the card to help it work tho?
nope
you gotta do it yourself
!hbb
!hbb
Homebrew Browser: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser
lol
Homebrew Browser: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser
i thought you can get stuff from the channel tho..
^^ that allows you to download and install apps directly from the Wii if you have an internet connection
Brahhm: you can do that with homebrew browser
lol

I swear I've seen you before OH YEAH THE DEV CHANNEL 5 SECONDS AGO :O
Can my friend use the smash stack on his 4.3 wii to install the hbc
13drfie
13there
to run homebrew? Yes. To install the HBC? Not easily.
How hard?
Quite a few risky and possibly illegal instructions to follow - it involves installing hacked IOSes and downgrading others.
...
That means really difficult
pretty much.
oldtopman: just hang tight. A new version of the HackMii Installer's coming soon.
well it's doable
you just gotta take a risk
i should go try it
What's the worst case scenario?
you ahve a brick
a nice shiny brick
You brick your Wii.
Mm, brick.
bricks have been shat
I'm pretty positive there IS a way of doing it legally, but most, if not all, of the tutorials on the internet host and encourage you to download files that are Nintendo's property. And of course, making it legal still won't make it safe.
the chances of you bricking your wii depends on how well you follow your instructions
well installing nusd stuff if it's unmodified
not really illegal
I eagerly await a new hbc installer
seeing as how you're not in anyway modifying it
it's been signed by ninty themselves
lol
:P
Downgrade?
lol
not games
IOS
no difference
oh uploading them
no no not hosting them
just because they aren't selling them doesn't mean you have any more rights to host them
downloading them is a different thing
yeah, exactly
why nintendo would make nusd a passive d/l server is beyond me
can you downgrade?
downloading from NUS is fine
oldtopman: Again, not easily - the method I described above IS basically a partial downgrade
oldtopman
you can get IOS41 from nusd
and isntall that
it's best just to wait until the new hackmii installer is out
and from there
you can get IOS15 downgarded and then get a working IOS36
but it all involves risk
Thanks then. I can wait.
you eff up you have a brick
but i'm a risk taker
i'd do it anyway
i can afford another $$$ for a wii
Will you $hare
03it's just drf
03no y, no ie
03no firefox either
/me runs
i guess i should try doign it myself
i can probably do it on nand emulated stuff
2lol
hell from what i've learned
the only IOS you'll need
is systemmenu + systemmenu IOS
but if you don't know exactly what you're doing, it's quite possible to mess SOMETHING up
and your wii will still bootfine
2hi drf
even if you don't brick, you could still end up with a Wii that won't play some games
or doesn't support SDHC
03hi
lol of course
but that's why i < 3 dop-mii
handles all that crap for me
bah nobody's selling a wavebird
i can sell you a wavebird
i mean for cheap, locally
one catch: i think i lost the reciever
receiver*
0,0
lol
but you can still have it

*mac chime*
?
well the HBB finally loaded the second time, and not bad, alot of nice things to check out
yes
although, as you've experinced, it's prone to crashing
yah unfortunatly
but it does help
if you can put up with a crash here and there
Good
yeah
When I start up the homebrew browser, It starts in textmode and gets a dsi error after 2-3min.
Once i reboot, I t works fine
what's it doing?
me too had the same problem
Downloading something, either pics or something else
GC2-D4 moddable?
oh
skip it and it should work
no
Thank you.
replace the drive
/me did not get much sleeps at night D:
thx
There is a message telling me its probably better to not skip it
but if you can't launch it, you should
do it
can take a while~
Due to going to sleep a little past 5 am and waking up at about 9 am to help clean the place up.
/me was at a parteh >:3
it are the icons of the apps
I hads vodkas, beers and tequilas :o
I'm sorry but you misunderstand me.
hbb problems cannot be solved except by the creator as far as i know, unless you have c knowledge enough to fix it yourself ;P
is it even open source?
The dsi error only happens the first time i boot it evar.
ho
oh
And was spending a lot of the time smoking a hookah D:
lu
gia
D:
No hangover though, which is always excellent~!
13hey MIchy
13i*
hbc isn't :P
Anyone watching the final match
they did it so that nintendo can't find out their exploits
Football is teh boring :o
...
Anyways
There should have been a red card against one of the netherlands players
Which is why I got to spend so much time on teh hookah yesterday, because the other guys went to watch football and no one else had arrived yet D:
the true exploits are smashstack/bannerbomb/etc arent they?
those two
too*
he kicked a player from spain in the chest
but they can also patch the holes hbc uses to install itself
an exploit is useless without the hbc installer and vice-evrsa
versa*
ja

/me wonders what he missed
6Wow, only now have I realized I checked 'Disable comments' on my TST page. Ovo
6No wonder.
2o3o
2lol
i think they shouldnt publish the details of how any of the exploits work
just put bundle them with the hackmii installer and be done with it, that way nintendo cant fix ANY of them

I have some game file I DL and some of them extract to iso files and I can add them to my hard drive
!Sneas
some of them come out as gamename.wad
10 mins of work
I need to know how to add them to the HD
Not too good
/me runs
7o3o
7Hai.
o3o
those WAD games are virtual console or wiiware games
QUANY
Hullo
adding them to HDD is rather complicated
I think they are VC games files and some are wiiware files
:o
you must install them to Wii's internal memory
use WAD Manager to install them
then some wbfs files and the only ones that will add with wbfs manager is the iso or a rar file
I need to know how to add the others
just told you
ok thanks a lot my friend
WAD apps install with WAD Manager
have a good day
you select IOS 249 , NAND emulator : Disable, Source : SD
ok thanks a million
be careful ..not all WAD's are good for your Wii
if your source is not trusted those WAD's could brick your console
i need some help plz
to install wii flow in 4.0 u frimware
what you need batman ?
thx for reply
i need to install wii flow in my wii system 4.0 u
to play games from usb
but i wanna know what the easier way to follow
your console is softmodded ?
my wii is alrready hacked and play copy games
yes
its
you have homebrew channel and WAD Manager ?
yes
its simply to install the wii flow
first of all..screw wiiflow
but what about the ios 249
use usb loader gx
that is requried
http://code.google.com/p/usbloader-gui/downloads/list?can=1&q=wad&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount
download r938.wad
place it on SD in WAD folder
ok but wii flow can download covers and working so good with covers and themes
you want to play games or watch covers ?
both
:)
usb loader gx also has covers and donloads them from the same place as wiiflow
ok
so place it in WAD folder and install with WAD Manager
ok what the 1 i install
its so many
r938 , latest
ok
i more thing
what the normal method used to install the sotmood to make any usb work?
any method , just make sure you have installed IOS 222 during the process
that's required for USB loaders
thats what iam asking about

/me squeaks.

error on 'updating to 4.1u'
...awwww crap I just realized one of my friend's birthdays is in like 7 days I need to get to work on a present
/me tackles and huggles.

idk what song I'd use I'll have to make a mix and use that
i saw it and was like ._____. how
7Saw that years ago.
i didnt
xD
but still hes my hero
7o_o
7Your hero's a fugitive?
what
yes
7:|
/me also wiggles
if your a teenager and can steal planes and not get caught for 2 years your amazing
/me 7facepalms
anyone know how to check what graphics card you have installed?
fight the power!
/me runs
hey Proto
Hi zen
7Sure, and then spend the rest of your life in jail. :P
13I wish My mom would stop coming into my room just as I dance to Lucky star
looooool
13Twice in a row she did that with the same sonfg
quan, if i was about to be caught, id crash the plane
Fatality
7What purpose would you bring?
has anybody been able to use ios manager to remove stubs from 222 223 249 250 on 4.3u
Should be somewhere under control panel :X
fun
7So you think crashing airplanes is fun?
if you go to like "hardware and settings" there might be an option to adjust its settings
not that part
i.e. I have the NVIDIA control panel since mine is a NVIDIA graphics card
7Running away from the law?
I don't know how to tell which one you have specifically though, sorry D;
yes :D
/me 7headdesks
I don't have a 'hardware and settings'
which is weird considering i wanna be a cop ._.
7You might check your brain.
yes i might check my brain
lol
7+wanna
once I've got this t hing running 4.1 and softmodded, should I be sure to not install any updates?
i thought thats what you meant
i tink the reason why it would be fun is cuz it would be actiony, and so far my lifes been pretty boring
7Well, guess what?
what
7You have a messed up vision of reality.
indeed
can any one here plz try to help me
its movies ok

all this stuff happens in movies and stuff and it looks awesome
D:
7Because it's unrealistic.
some teenager
7Take away the lighting, music, and drama, and it's stupid.
he was running from the cops for 2 years
13hey I can steal a plane
13its easy to take off
Ah, well, anything like it |D;
quan im just saying it would be cool, id never do it but still xD
13but hard to land
helooo
/me has Windows 7, which has a funky weird control panel.
same
closest I have is 'hardware and sound'
13he would have to do it just right on the landing
That's it
7Yet you admire him.
/me failed and misread the wrong thing, sorry
he was brave enough to actually do it
13if it was a cartoon he would just do it like in Family guy

GhaleonX his point was, hes been in here like 50 times asking
13Weeeeeeeeeeee
he was supposedly doing the mod some weeks ago and asked about the steps, and now hes pretending like nothing happened before?
... come to think of it, my 6 year old could probably follow the guide for a 4.1 system
<3
:D
and sombody helps him everytime, and the process repeats
I did and it was exactly as the youtube video
04what do you mean Quilava
#rp
why come i dont get stabbed?
04angle
I mean, its more 'top down' than usual.
right, I understand
almost from directly above
04screenshot?
I tend to interject when it's not necessary for some reason :P
and the skill circles jump around the screen making it hard to use them
I didn't take one, I'd need it to be a video otherwise it wouldn't help much
i do that when im on the weed
10ill stab myself to #rp
lol
so its ok
I am... maybe that's why :P

04oww
04hiccups

its not on there.
o.o odd.
but aparantely what I have is so outdated they don't have support for it any more
03Would that be a GeForce 6 series?
I'm confused
03wait
I don't know, I tried looking

the GeForce and nForce are two different things

03brb though
hi
or else you will 4DIE 1*ganon voice*
13okay Nicke

Unless you just lost it!

13XD
1-0
You would have lost this one other game though :o
oh. well.
my driver is about 70 versions behind
that might explain it
:o
so I get message you not loading stub ios
any idea howto remove stubs on 4.3u
no we palyed hard

lol
Not today, you're not!
Spain has no idea what I am talking about!
ouch D:
I'm takin' you in!
and I don't xD;
I'm just making guesses
I dont
/me is in the middle of other things and has no idea what you guys have and haven't tried yet
u talk about soccer?
/me puts my hands up
No, I am talking about the game.
Never mind.
and to tell how good the card is? XD See how far you can push it by running 3D games until it crashes
that's all I can think of
........[censored]........
/me slowly walks closer
it has to run them PROPERLY
I'm gonna guess that since it's old, it's not going to work very well
04what version do you have Quilava?
I don't know...
aah
:(
/me pets the... pet Curly.
Well if it can't run them at all, then I guess that's how good it is ovo
it says here 187 or something..
/me transforms into a judge
so now iam happy
04http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-64bit-257.21-whql-driver.html
04hmm
but this site is showing it in x.xx.xx.xx format
:(
04this is worth a try
the new world champ and euro too
/me grumbles
o.o
I do not like Spain.
trying.
as long as it's Judge Judy I might be ok
It's actually... Divorce Court!
Mwahahaha!
04it lists your driver in the supported hardware
Because it decided to pet someawesomeling perching in your hair? :o
:o
Hi, Awesomeling!
Actually, no
that one can be amusing
where >.>
/me sits on Curly's head! :3
04click the supported products tab
04its under GeForce 6 series:
if your looking for 64bit win7 nvidia geforce 6 series drivers try beta/unofficial ones
heh
although if you use the wrong drivers, it'll bug out alot
:x
:o
Yes!
Excellent.
GeForce 8800 or equivalent video card <-reccomended for LoL.
mine's geforce 6150 >.>
an epic-totem pole?
ah
/me blinks
i have a pc with a geforce 6200
Very much so.
I can't tell what is good. I don't know what numbers to look for
/me spreads his arms for the epicness
`SLAMMER`: from what i hear you are best off downgrading to 4.1 at the moment...type ? downgrade
/me takes a pictur
e
ednfjsdbjfkbwt
high numbers, with high numbers on VRAM, and processing power
basically
04just
04try the update that i linked you to
04and see what happens
I did
its asking me to restart now, so brb
04kk
/me waves his arms, flying the totem pole to the top of the hill of delicious.
when I skimmed that I thought it said Judge Bon Jovi
XD
then I read it a second time and was like oh.
The judge of... Soft Rock and Roll!! *awesome guitar solo*
XD
now I have to try to figure out if it worked or not
I find this band GUILTY of Rockin' and rollin'!
/me could have some fun with this joke
Judge Bon Jovi XD
:D
Hey
hi
/me kicked ass at parallel parking
:D
/me high fives!
:D
thanks
most welcome
glad to have made someone's day
:D
okay, that made it worse
now it also displays too far to the left
/late reply
04hmm
I can't see like the left sixth of the screen now.
04interesting
I guess you don't know which one is included...
I should just switch the cards from my computers..
if I knew how <.<
who is that?
I think he used to be one of the rolling stones
*waits to be killed for not knowing about some famous person*
04surely there has to be a business around that will do that for yo
04u
now he's just some old rock star from the 80s
I don't want to pay money for it >.>
Wanted Dead or Alive was by him
never heard it, so that doesn't help much
and some other song they used to play constantly on the radio
:P
but I forget what it was
How come the military bad guys in movies are always colonels?
colonel klink!
It sounds imposing?
Because all colonels are evil!
It's better than read admiral
Even Jack O'Neill!
04hold on
then everyone would just be making jokes
Ah here we go
it's called It's My Life
i do know
they played it on the bus a lot when I was in grtade school
i packed it myself
Your rear is a fleet!
I don't think I know it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_My_Life_(Bon_Jovi_song)
DCFG it has
click the sample button
my computer has been really slow lately
D:
wait I need those!
/me jumps after them
stupid netbook
:P
Oh, that song
/me dodges the dice and the Proto
?downgrade
? downgrade
all the more reason for the upgrade
"As a Democrat, Bon Jovi toured extensively on behalf of Presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, appearing at and playing acoustic sets (with Sambora) at rallies for the Kerry-Edwards ticket throughout the United States."
oh look, he's a li9beral
:P
how nice
I don't think Bon Jovi was in rolling stones
nah he wasn't, I just looked him up
I think he was just called bon jovi and he was one of those 80's glam bands
04not fully sure
he seems old enough though
and now he's some old fat country [censored]
lol
:P
now I have followed that guide exactly to the T hwoever when it gets to step 2 select ios 250 222 223 ect it fails every time
what's a li9beral?
linineberal
a liberal x9
:P
...scary
not loading stub ios
lol
actually it's a typo
is the error I get
/me stays away from him
a liberal x9 is called a "Josef Stalin"
XD
anyone have a problem with wii motion plus instructional videos not playing?
04why did you get a new computer in the first place?
sometimes refered to as a "Fidel Castro" on occasion
because my processor was 1.6Ghz and ram was 1GB
which is terrible.
but more commonly known as a "commie pig"
plus it had vista
so simply having the computer on ate up half the memory
04there are ways to turn off the eye candy
04that vista has
I did
it still ate a lot
just a little bit less
yeah :/
04i see
dropped from like 60% to 50% usage
Vista even without the addons that you can disable is a memory hog
it's very poorly coded
blarg
now I have that song stuck in my head
04ib guess if you want you can try to switch video cards
04but i really suggest you find somehow who is capable of doing it for free
it's better than the song I had stuck in my head before
04*someone
oh no
what wads that?
Ugh, *was
04its not really an operation you can just... phone in
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7PeePWNpQY
The song in that review
I could look it up online and see how complicated it is.
User-X use a launcher with alt dol support
No... if I see a video it will infest me as well
D:
have it start player.dol
:P
should start
jk, I'll watch
if its as simple as adding/removing RAM I can do it myself
it says "peep" in the link\
watch the motion plus vid and you should be good to go after that
like the noise a chick makes
04by all means try
04what is the graphics card on your old computer anyway
that song has some of the most ridiculous lyrics ever
oh... I absolutely HATE that song
D:
oh, we're going now
aww
byes
bye
never new.
*knew
success!
I'd have to actually hook it back up and check
04lol
but it ran LoL properly
so it's probably better than this one
system updated to 4.1, and loads dvdr games through the disc channel
huzzah!
when I run the homebrew channel, should I still say 'no' to the update?
bye :C
/me just downloaded a tooooon of placebo shiiiiit that for some reason she never had and does not know what to start with
04got to be curious though
oh shiiiieeeeeeet
muffin
/me pokes her coke
I think it's frozen solid >.>
:D
/me turns into a l4d2 charger and charges Misty off a skyscraper *random*
/me forgot it in the freezer when she left
D:
I'll check before I change them, if its possible for me to do
For example, in Avatar, in A Few Good Men
Ummm
/me thinks
The Hurt Locker?
04hmm
/me doesn't know if that was a colonel though
Inglorious Basterds
04i think it'd be the best benefit to check
do the Germans even have a rank called colonel?
Inglourious Basterds*
its as easy as changing RAM.
but I don't have an anti-static wristband.
Andras dun leik mispellings
:o
Step 5: Removing the old card
Locate the old card on the motherboard and remove it by firmly lifting it out of the slot it occupies.
Silly OriStone
yes
say no
The latest Star Trak movie
2o-o
simple enough
He was a Captein, but that's close :)
not in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly
CAPTAIN*
I beleive the evil soldier was a major in that one
oh
Also, Captain isn't all that close to Colonel
5Wut
...
or at least I don't think so
Naval Captain == O-6
oh naval
nevermind
Army / Marines Colonel == O-6
I'm gonna see if unreal tournament plays properly with this card..
ah, I thought you meant Army/Marines Captain
whic is like O-3
I think
/me nods
So, if you're a Naval Captain, that counts towards what I'm talking about
03Yay :3
10Hi :3
/me fails, misses and charges to his death as is always the case as playing as the charger on l4d2 online

If I'm thinking about the right movie
greatest fail special infected moments ever, you try to charge a survivor off the building on the first map on dead centre, miss, and fall to your doom
/me thinks he was a Staff Sergeant
he wasn't /really/ the bad guy
there were no real bad guys in that movie
/me shakes his head
13bye bye
but I think he comes closest
And no real colonels in there either :P
You're bald now
well, I couldn't remember >.>
I think a colonel popped in to stroke the team leader's ego a little while the other enlisteds facepalmed :3
And the doctor was a lieutenant colonel :3
/me didn't get a good look at his rank though
anyway misty just wondering if you were new to chat?
/me isn't sure what the moral of the story is
:o
anti-war is probably the most obvious one
5Ok bye bye all
13no
dammit the sound sucks too.
/me sighs
13yep and I'm proud of it
7Brb.
o-0
I guess colonel is the highest ranking field grade officers
Im not on chat enough to remember other peoples alternate names anymore
The admirals and generals just do paperwork and send faxes I guess :P
In the movies, at least
03Hi :3
Hammond did moar!
6But you know that, right? :>
So, yeah, once you get to O-7, expect to be nothing but an administrative assistant for the rest of your career :P
/me is being silly though :o
If you're in the movies
Wait, so it is like <=O-5 - Heroic guy, maybeh? = O-6 - Evil bastard! >=O-7 Officework
Yeah, and then,
Tends to go that way yeah
or lots of times good guy = member of revolutionary army in which rank does not exist
6ovo
6Brb. D:
there's got to be a tvtrope about this
:P
E-5 to E-8 - Heroic friend of heroic guy E-8 to E-10 - Decoration for the generals E-1 to E-4 - An extra to be used to for epic exploding death scenes
XD

oh yeah, now I see it
oh
13Â¬Â¬ What did you say?
or do you mean just Star Trek :P
Colonels are evil, generals/admirals are administrative assistants
I said
SHADOW LUGIA IS 4EEEEEVIIIIIL (and so is zororark fyi)
/me 13drops Nick
No Colonels in the Navy

/me somehow lands upright due to landing technuques learned by special forces
Starship/Naval Captains have a 50%/50% chance at either being the protagonist or antagonist
13hey Absol
In the case of Starship
that's because the villains tend to be aliens
:P
so the seat of villian is already taken

/me was looking for one
kk enough rpingforwardslashgodmodding, did anyone get the Jirachi from the wifi event?
/me tries to find it
13I did

"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass"
13Guesty
Especially with the Starship Captain / Admiral thing
yeah lol
I'm an Admiral on STO
im back
"This is probably because "Colonel" is the highest military rank deployable in the field, the highest rank unlikely to be noticed and Authority Equals Asskicking on TV." <-- well, this line for that article fits

no card at all
brb
brb
13Gym leader Roark has a Zoroark
:o
06nu uh
13you don't get it don't you.
oh yellow card
LOL
I forgot about Roark
:o
It looks like a yellow card from a distance
it was
I thought he didn't get a card at all
I mean, it looks like it should be
13LOL
It should be a red card
There's three types of fouls in FIFA: careless, reckless, and excessive force
Careless == overstepping fair play
Reckless == acted with complete disregard to the safety or consequences of the player
Excessive force == far exceeding the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring the other player
No card for the first, yellow for the second, red for the third
Now:
anyone here ever have there verizon wireless router swapped, the name and pass for it was admin and password1, but the nwe one doesnt seem to be the sae anyone know what it could be pm please
From a distance, it appears that he's going after the ball with the kick, but accidentally gets the player. It's not appearing to exceed that threshold from a distance, it's just "reckless", it's just a sloppy move that disregards safety
So, from his perspective, that's a yellow
But we have the luxury of high speed cameras, and we know that the player was trying to take him out
right
Which is serious foul play :3
Sooooooo
I don't feel very bad about it
Referees get a conditional pardon on this one
Although, I don't know why the center referee was sooooooooo far away from the play
Spain's goaly and two other players took down a netherlands player who had a clear shot at the goal, the player waved his arms and ran after the ref, same guy, gives him a yellow card
But the announcer guy is right
On closer inspection, there's no attempt to play the ball
He lucked out on that one
He's just lucky he didn't get kicked in the face
Oh wait a minute
I take back my pardon
The referee was right on top of that one
Yeah
OH!
He had a player in the way
Referees don't have x-ray vision
Quit doing that >:
...
:o
He was like eight yards away though :x
Okay, he should've seen that
GhaleonX, say yes to the update
The only other thing I can think of is he was debating in his mind whether to do red or yellow, and the crowd of players running up to him intimidated him a little
So, hmmm
Yeah, he reached for the red
hi
So. Final verdict, center referee is guilty
/me fluffles Proto
can someone please tell me what could be the cause of certain games making the screen flicker
>:3
Proto == correct :D
Hello peoples.
Anyway, bbl
o/
anyone???
PAL/NTSC mismatch?
\o
how can I fix that? Priiloader?
hi feather
10hi
that's what the screen does when it flickers...it switches from ntsc to pal on the screen
The loader should beable to force region.
Priiloader you mean?
No. Whatever you're using to load your games.
fail
neogamma R8 is it
10FLAME
10:D
when I try to force region, it switches back before it loads up
o
There's probably an option or it somewhere.
so should Priiloader do the trick for me

03It's ok :3

oh you mean like elemental typing?
6Yeah. Lol. :P
/me wonders where in Australia you -kiied because he thought it was too warm there for snow all year :3
03s*
/me runs :3
ah ok
The only case I have actually experienced where sheer rate of typing made the better "hacker" was... on a POS system... where the comm controller serviced the first interrupt it recieved. Not a token ring... but first come first serve.
o.o
XD
/me thought his silver energy was stooper effective against shadow types D:
Snowy mountains
And the terminals sent an IRQ each key stroke. :P
and this retarded computer is annoying
03lolwtf
Isn't letting me boot from the CD
Basically
03oh
03F8 at startup
the Mt Kosciozsko mountain range
03In BIOS
however you spell it
I thought all computers were different?
6Aura Sphere is a Fighting type move. Lugias are Psychic/Flying. ovo
03try o.o
Ergo... one fast typists and the computer "slows donw" for the people who can't type fast enough. Two fast typists and the slower people have no computer at all. Three or more fast typists... and war has been declared.
6But, eh, if shadow deflects that, I'll go along.
Mine is only F9, F10, F12
Tried it
didn't work
03Try F1
tried
03Try various F buttons then :<
03XD
Going to try that XD
F11
03And Boot options should be there
F11 works 4me
Speaking about refereeing >.>
So
Nothing worked
Apparently, there was a group of teenagers there
03And odd, I think my BIOS is borked on my main laptop
At the soccer field :3
I don't think I have access to my BIOS
Or it's retarded
but liek my aura spheres are different D: theyre all like lightpure and stuffs
03And you have to try as soon asit restarts o.o
When I walked around the track and was passing them standing there near their car, one of them asked me "Hey, don't you referee here?" and I nodded and walked on
at least thats what I plan in my fic sequel
03Try that
F10 = ROM Based Setup
/me didn't have a good feeling at that point
F12 = Network Service Boot
03And move CDROM to first o.o
Tried F9
oh
hang on
o.o
What happened
Or my CD is screwed up
6All right.
We are not all hostile
6But how's that fic going?
Probably that lol
I'm slightly hostile
And then when I walked back around to their point again, that same person said "Remember that time when you red carded me and I made that guy cry?"
6How's the ending going, exactly?
depends on my mood
It makes some pretty strange sounds
And I was thinking "I should have brought my gun"
Why didn't you
Usually no one is there
lol Boot Order
/me brought pepper spray instead though
Optical Disk Drive, USB CD-ROM
Move USB CD-ROM to first?
Yes
/me is no longer away : Gone for 11 minutes 32 seconds
/me is no longer away : Gone for 11 minutes 32 seconds
03Is the CD drive USB?
But I said "I've red carded a lot of people, I don't remember everyone I red carded" and walked on again
wb both of you
03Or built in?
/me blinks
It's inside the computer
When I was on the opposite side of the track about three-four minutes later, I noticed someone else pulled up next to that guy's car
/me didn't feel good at all at that point
I think it's built in
03Then Optical Disk Drive should be first o.o
Why didn't you leave at this point
i feel like i have a hangover yet i havent drank anything
hm
Didn't want to look like I was running away, didn't want to risk them chasing me :P
/me just followed his routine
if a hangover feels the way I imagine it does I feel that way too
But I had one hand on the trigger and one hand on my phone :P
woo
Slow cop response time and pepper spray
I'd rather run
/me tries del

And soooooo, before I made it up there, I went inside the building (which I have keys to as a board member) to pretend I had business in there -- that's a pretty sturdy safe room and I can improvise a lot of fun weapons in there to keep them busy
nope
del works on my 7 year old comp

vista blows
Visa*
yes i have visa too but no $$ on it
please understand that I don't consider myself an especially uncultured person
ok yea I have seen it
just not payed much attention
It's ugly
it's just that your history isn't wildly violent, nor present in any highschool textbook I've owned
should be there slogan
your quality of life indicies are impressive, though
giga u can have 50 connections
Vikings not included in highschool curriculum?
kinda why I did not pay much attention to it :X
they have an
it was, like, a 5-min cameo
Bieber loves the cawk
alternate method!
Nobody needs 50 connections.
heh
i usually play as the koreans in civ4
so i dunno
he loves getting butt fucked
korean language is mroe interesting, too
And transport tae-kwando?
i love cock meat sandwich
astra gives 20 and that is enough.
I'm looking for a new camera, despite not having a job or any money to afford it
xD
i hope they rape me and take off with the numbers to my card!!!! lol!!!
I just like giga cause it gives me free newsleecher w/ supersearch
i like civ3 better though
for some reason
$20/mo
and completion is better than astra
giga gives free newsleecher?
:X
si
astra's completion is like 95% at least, though.
I dunno, I had a file that was incomplete on astra, tried it on giga, was just fine
giga seems better for older stuff, in my experience anyways
:)
It probably is.
http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=&list=&vis=Snorre
any idea on how a game like that would run on wine?
Read some of this
But still not better enough to be worth tht much more $.
how you get it with giganews??
http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=asatru&vis=s_e_ynglingesoga
http://www.newsleecher.com/?id=special_gn
Giganews for 20 connections and no SSL is $25, astra with 20 connections AND SSL is $11.
I essentially have diamond w/o vpn for $20/mo
http://lind.no/nor/index.asp?lang=&emne=asatru&vis=s_e_hakon_den_gode
it's not bad
it's like the Genesis in the bible
That was a special, then.
I dunno, I may go back to astra eventually
yup
Diamond is $30.
Normally.
Except this is much older
actually, I think I took a class on this
Loki would always going around, messing shit up
so to get the deal with newsleecher i need to cancel my account and use something else or get it in somebody else is name
He is the trickster god
and Thor would wake up from a hangover, beat the shit out of him, and then drink and sleep some more
every story opened and closed like this
you guys dont like newshosting?
dune whats vpn
sounds like a really dysfunctional family
ns is bad
they delete new releases off ther servers
$14 for 30 connections + ssl
ns?
virtual private network
newshosting deletes new releases off ther servers
its happen with SMG2
happened*
oh
(thanks for the FreeCiv tip)
as soon as they get posted they delete
I wouldn't use that as the deciding factor for which service to pick, because they allhave to honor takedown requests if they get them.
He has to do with the death of balder, so in a way they rely on him
well aw hasent
what have they taken down
so there
besides smg2
giganews did it too
when will they start cracking down on usenet
do u guys think
Bieber: 6 months ago?
they are any lawsuits?
usenet.com
astranet is good
astraweb
astraweb i mean
usenet.com was stupid, though

2I kept thinking "why are they making him look like a demon animal? o-o"
lolwell, in Korea I saw those small toyvendingthings and some had KHR chars in it :D
It is for me and i average about 1.2TB per month from astraweb

Says you!

says Ari :O
/me points at Ari's crown
I meant it as in 'that's rather ironic, seeing as you just molested me'
I just poked you D:
I know you probably didn't notice the rules, I go to channels all the time without noticing the channel rules :3
But.... um... could you, like, look through them, please? :3
I think the idea is to sport a huge solar panel atop the house, generating electricicy is just a secondary concern
Wait, people read the rules?

I am only speeding cause I have to go poop <--- best bumper sticker ever
when I lived in a real house there was a tree outback
had 3" thorns all over the branches
o_O

Evening
04wb
04*late*
Meow
thanks

04I have two assignments to do and a reading/writing task to be done
04it's goddamn bullshit

04
Lol
04how is that even possible
04?
lol
8D
All goes well
Or if I did
12i see
bbl
12i have a headache
I probably wasn't listening
/me runs
I received my bronzong I ordered
And that's too bad
:(
04no
12i have a good feeling
12that abomasnow will be good
How'd you get it?
12snow play
The headache, that is
12but i can't think of who else to play abomasnow with
04atm I wish I never told my mum I had assignments
.-.
damn
doesn't matter
12if used right
12a single belted abomasnow can take out 2 donphans
Something assistive, maybe
12if they are belted or not
Like nidoqueen
12i would play it with bronzong
12MD
And that
Hmm
12actually before nidoqueen existed
12that was a deck
12but the problem is that nidoqueen rapes that idea
Heh
12i currently play abomasnow with http://pokegym.net/gallery/displayimage.php?imageid=48223
omnomnomnomnom
I know
12because expert belt for 1 grass energy, does 50 and makes you draw 2 cards to make up for the fact that you no longer have claydol
12but still, 50 damage drains away fast in nidoqueen's presence
I really cant think of a viable alternative right now
Maybe in the morning
http://www.randomfunnypicture.com/pictures/741mtv-cribs-squirrel.jpg
04for some reason
04the server is lagging really badly
o.o
04i don't know why

lets say one wanted to download o lets say all usenet headers and wanted to browse thru them, what app is good?
04it's not named for it being 3D, but rather something to do with the story or something...
04like 3D has a different meaning than 3-Dimensional
o______________O
Lol, we're 4-Dimensional creatures 8D

prseid
im not even..
on the new persona
since its the same story as persona 3
for me its useless since i know the story
im gonna start a game
of
XENOGEARS:)
I read a review on RPGamer. It's really different.
nah fuck p3
i finished
it
u played xenogears?
on ps2?
no
psx
then get the psp version
In Persona 3 Portable, for the female protagonist, eight of them have been completely redone with new characters, while most of the rest have been significantly altered.
...
change nothing
The developers also took a page from Strange Journey, introducing brand new Skill Cards that allow you to teach any skill to any persona.
that nyx is the last boss
oh
hmmm
Vision Quest mode, which doesn't become available until the game is nearly complete. In this mode, you can refight all the bosses from earlier in the game, their strength increased. Defeating them grants rare skill cards as rewards. There are also a series of five specially designed fights, in which your party, level, and even personas, are specifically restricted.
interesting
see your ignorance isnt helping u
pakigirl
now go get it
lo shadow
u play xenogears on psx?
Yeah. Awesome game.
of omfg
I'm not sure I'd hve the patience or it now, though.
this game is HUGE
*for
ITS REALLY LONG
Unskippable cutscenes with unskippable text.
LOLLLLLLL
thats what she said
xenogears is 80 hour
First time took me 52 I think.
perseod u know what i found ackward
LOL
For me P3 with FES is by fae the longest at 94 or so.
and pakigirl is a girl LOL
*far
yeahhh
sigh
xenogears= 108 hour
pakigirl, u asked a question in another channel
i responded
her train left hours ago
so waitinf for u
u finished xenogears?
pakigirl
Yeah. 52 hours.
pakigirl
wow
so waitinf for u
u remmeber
DEUS?
dues ex sux
Yeah. I remember the plot fairly well.
no
ok
remmeber
Miang?
Yeah.
wow u remmeber:)
pakigirl
good memories
i was so young when i played xenogear i was like 13 or 14
I'd buy a modernized remake of that. Too bad that'll never ever happen.
the graphic look like ff tactic

still good

If you save me I'll help save other people on your behalf

you'd send a near drowning victim back in to save drowning victims? :p

But.... it's math :o
And maybe I just have cramps or something
MATHS WINS.
PERIOD
I ate a lot of food and jumped in
f(x) = 2^x \o/
I never got the hang of functions >.>
or at least... if I did I forgot
It's the same as y = 2^x :3
y = f(x)
okay
LOL thats interesting to put it in the books
so you have the original amout of people being 100
04?
Curly: Basically, y = the rate of time, and x = how many people are saved
Its a very interesting code in oblivion
then after 3 mins there are 50 people
thay days
I don't think math applies in such a basic way in this kind of situation >.>
Curly: It doesn't
find the constant of proportionality

you can either use your brain

or make the AI use its

in any case, its a good riddle XD
And
since if you noticed in the book, every single word at the beginning of a paragraph in those books has its letter in an incewased, daedric style writting
f'(x) = 2x^(x-1)
then again it is daedric cult run by a man whose 400 years old o3o

which reminds me of a very lulzy maths joke
/me leans in and whispers
It's just the derivative :3
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
e^x and pi walk into a bar. Suddently pi exclaims: "oh shit, look there, that's a fucking differential operator. I'm outta here".
e^x: "Wat ?"
pi: "Look man, i'm a freaking constant, he's gonna cancel me out..."
e^x is not impress and walks up to the differential operator: "Hey, bastard, think you can bully me and my buddy away ? well guess what, my name's exponential and I'm not afraid of you !"
and the differential operator grins and answers: "Hi. I'm d/dy".

A mathematician, a biologist and a physicist are sitting in a street cafe watching people going in and coming out of the house on the other side of the street. First they see two people going into the house. Time passes. After a while they notice three persons coming out of the house.
The physicist: "One of the two measurements wasn't very accurate."
The biologist: "They have reproduced".
The mathematician: "If now exactly one person enters the house then it will be empty again."

04and all of my team fell for it

04i hate this game so much
04why do i play
04i don't have an answer for that question
no

04i don't even care now, if i win or lose i'm still getting to level 16 after this match >_>
...?
is this a zelda game?
04probably WoW
/me hides
XD
er cat
or that Guild game :P
04no
04Guild Wars?
04it's a DotA mimic
lol
04Defense of the Ancients?
04from Warcraft 3?
04oh come on

awww
a rat and cat are friends
04I suck at that too
04yeah
04Drake
04but it's still fun
04i suck at more stuff than you do
04trust me
then you are united in sucking at that said game whatever it is
04it doesn't matter
04calm down
I'm guessing its an RTS o3o
04it's a game
is it?
04Warcraft 3 is a strategy game
04like AoE
then its an RTS
04only based in the WoW world
Real time strategy
04ah
04only
04in the World Editor
since you know...FPS
etc
etc
04alot of people
play it?
ONline? :P
04make maps where you only control a single unit
04then share them online etc
04and it's a change from the RTS that the game was meant for
04to a more WoW gaming style
hmm...
04level up your unit, get stronger, kill the enemy
04i can say the same thing about pokemon to you Drake
04?
/me is focused on trying to properly install the mod DDD:
curses, this is difficult
04lol
04i remember when you didn't want to play matches
04because you couldn't win
04heh
04yeah
drake; dun laugh D:
04back when I was a whining sod
its hard to properly bring this into creation XD

aww
since if you do something wrong
duck and a dog are friendly
Oblivion dies
textures just go hell
whats with the gay vids?
Open cities :O
good, but hard as hell
Is this the open cities mod I've been hearing about?
/me is new to Oblivion
what gay vids?
04open cities?
yes
But this is the one with ALLL the open cities and all patches to other mods
drake; it changes cities
these
04oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikm3o5hDks&feature=related - a rat and cat are friends
wait
no not open cities
Better cities
Open cities removes loading screen from cities
But in any case; Its the hardest mod to download
it literally tells you if you're computer is too old
or you're a starter for mods
it basically says' <censored> you n00b"
04lol
and you need the OBBM
how so?
I'm still level 1?
04lol
and I don't have any mods installed :o
you just escaped the prision right>
*?
ok, take my advice
you'll need to go to Elder Scrolls nexus and join their forum
to get every mod
or at least be able to download
Nao
though for the actual mods
you need the newest patch for oblivion
and, before I go on, do you just have oblivion
or the whole oblivion + knights + SI
04wow i'm so depressed i can't even think through this game
others you can't
I'm semi good at RTS, whats the situation?
get LTDVampire overhaul
best. Vampire mod. Ever.
enough said~
04o-o
04i have bad luck?
On the game
04i keep getting paired up with bad players
eh?
Histuff.
hi
04it's not only RTS
04it's a team game
045 vs 5
Hmm..
well then best advice I can offer
use your team mates as bait
then kill everyone :D
04actually nvm I have to go
No I havent
/me facerolls
for I'm learning languages |:
Let us explode! :D
Okay, yes?
Yay!
Bah, why can I not ghost myself? :(
Boooring.
/me just explodes then.
:O
Dang
took things and blue with him
It's super effective!
you need the SI
(shivering Isles)
and I'm wandering around the city at the moment, been to see whatsisface at the abbey and given him the amulet but haven't gone anything more along the main storyline
or other things
wait...
PC?
or other?
cause apparently the first oblivion gate is a <censored>
Yes, PC
well for starters
you're level one
so...
scamps
and lesser other beings
with some Dramora
so that
+ you
will; <censored>
but bad story
you get stronger
your enemies do from oblivion
but I dont blame ya
work on your skills first
blade
blunt
conjuration
destruction
and illusion + sneak and security
best skills
and most often used
illusion as invisibility and night eye
sneak is Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild
Security is DB and TG
and others
like main quest
Blade is for every faction
Blunt, same thing
04wow i'm so depressed
04my last 10 matches
04i've only won twice
DDDD:
04and my last match i was so depressed i couldn't even think correctly
04its a game
04within a game
04it's called insignificant
04its not just a game
its honor and glory?
04when i see a game, i see another chance of succeeding at something, out of the many failures in my life
04excuse me but
/me /drama
04but all that happens with every game i play is i end up failing again
'every game'?
04every game
you couldnt have possible lost every game
like hop scotch or counting
04hop scotch and counting aren't games you get recognized for
and then failures provide how to do better
04oh...ha
04hahaha
04whatever
04you wouldn't be a millionare by learning from your failures
04i've failed so much
like for instance
04that if i learned from all my failures i would know almost everything in the universe
if Drake accidently stabbed himself
04You know, I'm tired of this
or I accidently burnt my hand
04which yeah, information is valuable
04I put up with this crap enough with Shiny
/me idles
/me shrugs
But, then, how does the game work?
04if you accidentally did it
04what does learning from it prove?
learning from it that I need to be paranoid and wear protection
or if I was say 5
I'd stay away the <censored> near it
04solutions aren't always that easy
No, thats just a small example
04in fact solutions are rarely ever that easy
and I dont think learning failures in wars concern your situation
but, then how do you lose the game?
do you just lose all your troops?
lose the flag? lose the HQ?
04lose your HQ would probably be the closest
Ok
Is it like you build up your HQ defense?
04there is this building that you can't get destroyed or else you lose
or army?
ah, I may help then
I've played some RTS which is kinda like you're playing
!google league of legends wik
Google search: There are no results.
04i
!google league of legends wiki
Google search: There are no results.
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends#Gameplay
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends
Title: League of Legends - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
this?
04maybe
ah..I see your problem
the problem is that, let me guess, you play your own 'person'
and have a amount of magic and health
and different attritubes determining the person in total
and thus you go to attack or defend
right?
04that made no sense
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV2rRcskn4Y
Video Title: League of Legends - Gameplay Battle Video 1
is that the game?
04there aren't two league of legends games
i know what game you're talking about
though its kinda like BfME
*BFME 2
so, why are you losing exactly? (other then building blows up)
04i can't answer that
04because i can't find a logical explanation other than i have horrible luck
04matchmaking randomly assigns you with players around your skill level but it never feels that way
I really dont believe in luck
So then, you usually get' suckish people'?
04and 90% of the time it always feels like either i get paired up with sucky people
04or the people i get paired up against are just god
Then think out battle plans first?
or tell the sucky people to take good positions?
so you can try to assult the other HQ
04i'm not that good with tactics
Then Ask me
I'm fairly well with RTS
04heh
04makes no difference
04i quit LoL
Ok
what about the zelda game?
04what about the zelda game?
hows it going?
04which one
the 2nd one
04not descriptive enough
04so i'll just say them all
04MM i gave up on
04TP i haven't touched in awhile
how about the one with the evil moon?
04that is MM
ah, why give up on it?
04there was this one part i couldn't get past
04oh well
04i was warned it was a hard game
04I HAD to give up on Metal Gear Solid 1
04i had no choice there
02gewt MGS4 :O
04part of the game makes you look at the back of the game case
04well guess what
04i downloaded it
04i don't have the game case
02yeah..game codes
02in which you have to call peoples
04i have MGS4
04why do you think i was so desperate to finish MGS1
02because its a good series?
04exactly
04if you played one of the later games of a series
04wouldn't you be a little curious how the series started out?
02I started the 2nd
02the played the 3rd
04i played 1 when i was a kid
02finally finished the 4th after some months it came out
04never finished t
02did you beat it? :O
04it
02oh
04then skipped to 4
02well play 2nd or 3rd
04i don't have a PS2
02o3o
04had one
04actually i had two
02bigger fat ones?
04bought one, it broke
04bought a second one
02that eventually broke
04it broke, gave up buying them
02well the bigger ones
02will break
02mine ladted 3 years
02and I still have my smaller one
02or 4..
02i dont even remember
04i'm surprised the smaller ones are more durable
04but i'm not going to buy a PS2 anyway
02download Fallout?
02its a good game
04even if there are plenty of games that well yeah
04that i liked for PS2
02Star Wars battlefront? :P

man I wish I could goto a site like engadget and not have to read about 80 different kins of cell phones, there is other technology
U R A cellphone
wow go back to joke school
dude look
don't be jealous of my jokes
srzly
was a pretty good joke
will priiloader stop the flickering of some games???
you sure the flickering isnt from wrong video type? NTSC, PAL, etc?
it may be...it only does it when I put in certain games
how do I go about fixing that problem
you're playing out of region games....that's why they're flickering
are you using disc or usb?
disc
neogamma?
what's up Wulfgar...how are you?
are you using neogamma to load your discs?
yes..R8 actually
see if you can force the region
How? I tried everything..it just keeps going back to the regular config
Flickering/stutter is due to the speedcap of Softmod DVD-R speed cap
that's why usb > * ;)
you lost me Digital
Softmodded Wii using DVD-R has a speed cap
of like 3x
I aint got the money for a god damn external drive
a softmod reads dvds a LOT slower than hardmod
and the modchip is like 6x
so if you are softmodded at all you should be using USB HDD
the crazy thing is...when I have the system at my house, it works fine..as soon as I take it back to the owner, it does that with certain games...the same games that worked at my house flawless on the same system
no slowdowns/flickers or jitters during any video scenes
Its not flawless if its softmodded using DVD-R
put a game with a video intro at the begining like Mario Kart Wii and watch it stutter
fair enough...but it doesn't do it when it's at my house..only when I take it back to the owner
doesnt do that with USB HDD or Chipped
be back soon
if it stutters at a certain point, it'll do that no matter where you take it or hook it up
well, then again..my sytem is hard and softmodded..never though of that
it flickers when I put in Call of Duty Reflex...bnut not SM Galaxy 2
softmod cancells out the hardmod
forever
until you fucking DIE
and then the tv goes from ntsc to pal
softmod doesn't cancel out ALL hardmod...just most of it
Wulfgar, you still with me
if you softmod a wii, it WILL stutter during video intensive portions of a game
so what can stop that? priiloader?
nothing
I didn't install priiloader
usb is the only thing that would help that
priiloader has nothing to do with stuttering
I'm gonna eventually do the usb thing for myself...but for others...not a go
what's the easiest method on doing the usb thing anyway?
then if they insist on using discs, they WILL have stuttering...nothing you can do about it
I tried it once and it didn't work for me so I gave up
deadity
13deadily
/me eats
Hmmm
I just bought a Moleskine notebook
Inside and on their web site they mention that they will mail you a free replacement if you find any defects in it
And lo and behold - I found one on two pages deep inside the notebook
Think I should try sending it in?
</random muse>
ok
What
10It seems as if the first time I come on in months nobody appears to be chatting on here.
hey Wulfgar ya a forwarder for lets say mario kart wii
i get only a black screen, any idea why
anyone know their stuff enough to help please let me know
you mean like a forwarder for a game you have on usb?
ya
those need to be installed to nand
people usually talk in here?!
since when
u mean through a wad for ex?
/me somehow avoids
if it's a game you have on usb, and you normally use cfgloader, etc, you can make a wad for it using CRAP...then install that wad and it'll put a channel on your main menu...for launching it w/o having to load cfg
i installed it, shows up fine, doesnt launch the game only a black screen
Hax
ya but what option in crap for the loader to use>?
/me is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 10:55a -( P:Off / L:On )-
so far i tried like 3 myself all same thing
through crap, any idea what loader to use in it?
is there any reason i shouldnt force NTSC for all games in config.txt (CFG Loader)? seems like if i force NTSC on US games it works fine, and I need to force NTSC for PAL games. so why not just force all in the config.txt?
Wulfgar any idea?
thats the problem i am running into, dont know what loader works
hmmm

http://designfabulous.blogspot.com/2010/07/htc-1.html <- Nice ohone concept but
*phone
Scroll down and look at the UI mockups
In particular, the News screen
doesn't matter... remove the update and usb load it
but does it have it or not ?
why does it matter?
just to make an uppdate without internet
is it possible to do it from usb stick now ?
why do you want to update to 4.2?
do the 4.2 softmod
which menu are you on?
it doesnt matter... i just fund its much easear to do an 4.2 soft mode update then 4.1, and sometimes i have 4.0 3.4 and all others versions.. and uppdating all of them to 4.1 or 4.2 from internet takes long time
so i whant to find a way to update it without internet
its not easier, its more work
its not..
i fount it much easyer
seems less ideal than the current HTC UI
but i maybe do use some pl
old methid
method
sorry bad english
yeah you are on your own on that one
what do you mean ?
so what are the current recommendations for a 4.3u wanting hbc? wait?
yes
That or go back in time and don't update.
ok.. is there onother way to do an update ?
like from usb ?
let say from 3.4 to 4.1 ?
yeah, I give my scouts honor that I won't update through nintendo anymore =*(
Maybe, but look what's on the news screen
? list
? softmod
updating to 4.2 is just DUMB
all depends
if u modded for a dumb neighbour/friend
then its better to safe update to latest so they dont go fucking it up
no... priiloader, block updates...job done
true
but lets work on the assumption that you mod a 3.2 and the game does a check for min 4.1
hi Aurora
as far as i am aware no games currently do that
except MAYBE that rugby game
as that is some serious fucked up coding check...
as I said... updating to 4.2 is dumb... use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide, you'll end up on 4.1...priiloader block updates, job done
you could update from 3.1 to 4.2 with safe updater
zdx, sd, not usb
you don't use usb to 'hack' a wii
sd only
there is a 4.1 safe updater as well :P
but safe updater requeires internet don´t it ?
your opinion is brash, i;d much rather the dumb neighbour/friend look at system menu and see the latest system menu.... they feel more comftable especially the fucktards that liek to think they know what they are doing but dont have a clue
can i download 4.1 systemfiles to SD ?
plus. you can buy 4.2 now in stores :(
no reason to go to 4.2
no technical reason no
ive got 4.2
purely to insist on it being 'n00b friendlier'
you could probably use NUSD to download alllll the freaking ios files and the new 4.1 system menu but thats a waste when you can just do it via safe updater
zdx, all updaters require internet afaik
"ewww why you got the old system menu, you do realise 4.3 is out now"- says the technoob
"ok lets update it" - says the ubernoob
ohh cool
my mini is here !!!
gtg guys , got a Mini Carbio 2010 edition :p , lorry pulling up now !!!
/me gone for the night !
on google
zdx, why use NUSD when you can use the damn updater?
because i dont have wiifii
wifii
wifi*
thaks :)
has anyone installed linux on their wii
you'd have to download ALL the ios's as well as the system menu...will take ages
can i do it from homebrew browser?
i havnt looked
i just installed the browser right now
elmagico, go look then
oh
opera is there
i dont have it I´m just about to run to the store to buy it, and i dont whnat to waste my money, that why i whant to find out
never heard of goggle.com, eh?
the thins is what i do find diferent information on diferent sites.. dont know what surse is trustable
for those that are too lazy to google for themselves, yes, NSMBW has 4.2 update on it...now go buy the damn game, update your wii to 4.2 and softmod it

StuNNa, why do you want to use wbfs?
oAo
6backing up my backups suddenly doesn't sound like a stupid idea :|
I want toribash
for wii?
its out?
today
WOAHHHH!!!!
FINALLY
hahaha
look for the wad
it'll be out eventually
damnit
i need 500 more wiipoints
plus system update 4.3
or the updated shop cahnnel
you are the worlds biggest failure
go to hell where you were born and belong
harsh words there
just joshing around
cause I'm smoking marijuana
im waiting for my marijuana
toribash looks incredibly boring
lmao
go get some meth so you can OD and we don't have to listen to your pointless rabble anymore
i got a question
i got an answer
how do people get the wads?
lets hope they match
meth isn't hep
out of the channels?
you can od on methj?
must take alot
usenet maybe, forums, who knows, other people??
like they buy toribash, how do they extract the wad?
maybe torrents i don't know
that's why I keep so many redundant files^^
6I like being organized :|
me too
6I'm flipping out about how unorganized my music files are right now
6but ugh, that's too many to organize
but I still have copies of the files I had with my computer about 7 years old or so
you never know what might happen. And I'm quite happy having at least the most important data saved somewhere if my entire home should burn down
6this song is so hauntingly beautiful, and I'm still crying :|
6I don't think I want to see the movie, tbh
6but then again...I kinda do ._.
any one got the 4.3 downgrade to work?
16 of the 17 wads fail to install
can anyone help?
I have had enough of this little white piece of shit
lol
excuse me?
6and so I watch it
damn racist.
why did you upgrade it in the first place then
following a duff guide on youtube :(
and read the guide, the process works fine for downgrading
followed to the letter
some guide told you to upgrade to 4.3?
i am using indy
i highly doubt that unless it was a joke
the guide was for fw 4.3 so I upgraded first. Im new to this and didnt know 4.1 was best
lol
the down grade doesnt work
not for mine
it does work
that's not a very smart move :)
umm i cant get any to work, i used to be able to when i had a wbfs drive. NBow i made it fat 32 and cant get it to work tyhey all go to a black screen
never tried it with fat32
I am using Indy. MMM loads and the it says go to load another IOS
ahh for real, this shit is a bitch
anyone here have a fat32 with game channel forwarderS?
just downloaded R6
that work
this months ver
step one is to get into MMM. That works
umm i installed them as wads from gbatemp and even made my own
step 2 is to install wads
it says.....
-Select "Load another IOS" -press A
done
if anyone knows please help out
it then says.....
-Select ios250, or 222/223 or perhaps or others
oh and my usb gx wont load shit but cfg loader does, any ideas?
less than $1.5 :)
because usb gx is trash
cfg loader much better
if I select any of these it says "not loading stub IOS"
i like how it shows the disc spiining etc
but i have to say cfg runs train on my games, no issues so far
umm do i need to point out a folder in cfg or some shit to get forwarders to work?
just make sure you have the proper files
proper ios etc
:( :(
4.3 isn't a guarantee softmod/hack...it doesn't work for some people...which is why you shouldn't have upgraded in the first place
the files all came in the pack o the guide :(
which is alos why there is no 4.3 guide on the bots
also*
? list
DOH!
I have that IOS41 v3348. Is it possible to downgrade and IOS?
eh?
downgrade is bad, mmkay
guys do any of u use game channle forwarders or no?
only forwarder I use is for cfgloader
wulfgar u think its better than forwarders, thats what i have now a cfg lchannel that works
is it really that much work to just load cfgloader via a forwarder and THEN load the game you wanna play?
no i guess not just like how they look in their own little boxes
Go to cfgloader and scroll through all your games, better experiance
ya i hear that, any idea where i can find some good themes for it. Only thig i have seen is a page with like 12 lame ones
but Wulfgar u told me that earlier then i asked a q about it and u never answered me
Cobra, forwarders suck up mad memory on wii
the wads that CRAP creates are only 8mb
I have used CRAP and dont know which loader to try and build it with , i tried a couple like 1.1 and they didnt work. The latest one i tried for punch out said error -6 or somthing whn i launcg it
feature of cfg
ya only 7 to 8 or so , they take up like 6 blobks and i dont use the nand for anything else atm
and set priiloader to boot cfg...
then you'll always be in cfg
wait one sec let me check that out
so whats it exactly going to do?
return_to_channel will let you set cfg so it reloads itself when you press the 'home' button
oh cool so no need to relaunch?
return_to_channel = forwarderID
/me waits for impending tornado
where do i set this at menu where bootmii can be written or dumped etc?
you set it in the cfg config file
use the configurator for cfg
? priiloader
know of a site with a good amount of cfg themes>?
make your own
was there a bot on here which had search options or am i on drugs?
try ? list
? list
thanks
looking for a priiloader guide i finally got a router and want to setup the wii for the net but don't want my sister to accdiently update
www.google.com
? brickblocker
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Preloader/Priiloader
you work for them?
hahaha
whats this brickblocker same thign?
no
? brickblocker
priiloader is full of hacks...one of which is to block updates
brickblocker is to remove the updates from games before burning them
ooooh ok seeing as how i don't burn games and just use wbfs manager i guess i don't need that
wbfs ftl
fat32 > *
well ya i found out later that ntsc is supported but oh well
you mean ntfs
hahaha ya my bad
problem with wbfs is that you can't even scandisk the drive
or defrag
it's hardly possible to fragment it though
sure it is...add/remove games...
now you're fragmented
oh right, in my mind I thought of a world where all isos are same size *coughs*
yes, removing a small iso then adding a large one causes the large one to fragment, you're right
and the size of .wbfs files varies even more
hi
how do i successfully choose a cheat in cfg?
i clicked it but when launch the game it says no code found when its about to launch
well what would i need to do to use ntfs
T00lM4N, use fat32...nothing is bigger than 4gb for wii
updating firmware is possible now?
would i still be able to use wbfs manager to load my games or how would i go about doing that?
mapd, never update beyond 4.1
T00lM4N, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager
Wulfgar just doing it to beat bald bull ( :
T00lM4N, you can find the latest version of wii backup manager here: http://tinyurl.com/wiibackupmanager
sd
T00lM4N, if you used the softmod guide linked on the bot, you should already have priiloader installed
but now that i'm going to connect it to my router i'm scared the little one will update and fuck it up
T00lM4N, and what fw are you on now?
4.2u
when i bought my wii it came with that on it
then go back to the 4.2 guide and follow the steps for priiloader
? list
? softmod
ahhh doesn't seem that complicated at all
the readme scares me the guide is nicer
you have bootmii as boot2?
as an ios
what is an NZB file?
New Zealand Bitch file
Nice Zebra Bitch
no!
in terms of wii channels
if you have it as boot2 and have the bootmii folder on your SD, bootmii will pop up every time you power on the wii
someone gave me a toribash download link
there is no nzb as a wii channel
an nzb is for usenet
Nintendo Zebra Bitch
oh sorta like a torrent?
kinda
i got it from here
much better than torrent though
but im not sure if i should trust it
http://d6c89a5b.thesefiles.com/
do you even have usenet access?
no
probably not
then you can't even use it
T00lM4N, I'd make the whole drive fat32
screw wbfs
i might do that later on, if i don' thave bootmii as boot2 is that a big problem for installing priiloader?
no
no but you will have a higher degree of confidence messing with the system menu ios
chances of bricking with priiloader is pretty slim
/me is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 02:17p -( P:Off / L:On )-
so just do as the guide says? i don't have to do anythig different since i migh tnot be on boot2
cross your fingers
in that case fuck that
i rather not install priiloader
just figure out which release is the most reliable for your system menu
only reason i really want to connect my wii to the net is to download covers
just turn wiiconnect24 off
you can still download covers
Kyuuuuuuuhai~ O:
so as long as wiiconnect24 is off i don't have to worry about my sister updating to 4.3?
in your case, priiloader is the only brick protection you have at the moment
Tool
password protect you net
bb-q it is
then dont tell sis password
or if you want, mac filter you net, so that you control what connects to it
bb-q but once i set it she wouldn't have to re-enter it
you dont leave the wii setup to connect, just delete when you are done getting covers
if you have a cios installed, and it gets updated to 4.3, you can downgrade to 4.1 using the korean ios files
takes 2 secs to restup
thats what I do anyways
a bad wad file install
good point bb-q
bb-q is like some kind of cell phone
seriously
U R FUNNY!
thats pretty much it?
yeah, if you dont run burned games, you should be ok
heh if you could figure out what site/domain nintendos does its update through, you could block that in your router
k ya just thats why i didn't want to install priiloader from the beginning
i'm just scared i'm gonna fuck it up
i'll just do as you suggested, connect24 off and delete my connection after i'm done getting covers
i don't give a hoot about playing any games online
/me sits all over Aero's tablet
hey guys i hadnt updated games to kids wii in a while
but i addded like 10 today

Ffffffffff
2D:<
http://code.google.com/p/priiloader/
2it was WEIRD
I can tell by the title
2well actually it was basically "if an apple a day keeps the doctor away, what does half an apple do?"
2and then the last line was something along the lines of "Let us chase the doctor away~"
2which was weird
so a half apple chases the doctor away because the doctor tried taking a bite from the apple

Wah.
Aurora, no it wasn't
Secrets?
rated R
6but I was sitting here thinking "they'll make it out alive, they'll take it back, everything will be fine"

you don't kno..oh
hahahahaha

Hi Articuno
6not at that time
13it was really crazy how that dude jump on the wheel while the plane was taking off
6no one knew what was ahppening until it happened
6*happening
6...
6What story are you talking about?
13but that scene was fake
6I suddenly think we're talking about two different things
12Hi :3
Arti, guess what LOL
I ate at a different Panda Express today
where my other receipt said XAI
this one said ALEX
13the scene when the black dud jumps from the car onto the jet
so it must be the cashier's name
13that has to be fake
6...
meaning LOLOL SOMEONE'S IRL NAME IS XAI
6I don't know what story you're telling
13Flight 93
6...
6wow then that movie is pretty darn hollywood style
that never happened in the movie
it's not
6because that's NOTHING compared to thestory
6*story
13no car can keep the same speed as a large boeing taking off
/me 6just lets him talk
13I'm done
is it true that leaving GC.pad or memcards plugged in is baiting a brick?
13I need to get ready in 15 minutes
13to go to town
13soooo
13bbl
6meow
doing what?
i think i have had a gc memory card in
since launch
hard mod + soft mod
since you could
no brick ....
some shit says not to have gc mem/stick
k
what you up to today
kafia ?
kiffa
yea many tuts warn to remove it
i just got my wii component cable so now i can sell my gcn
just wanted to know if its save to leave them plugged in if all u do is play or install wad games
if tuts say to remove.. prob best to remove just to be safe
but as long as i just play wii games i can leave it in, or?
hey, anyone here have their sensor bar above a big flat panel?
6lol
6 2.2 days worth of music
Soljarag, i tried that but it sucked, put it at bottom now
6compared to others, it's not much
6but if you think about it
46"
6I'd have to sit here for over 2 days to hear all of that
I prolly have about 2 months
is yours wall mounted?
/me runs
yes
6lol
I just don't use iTunes, wtf is the point of an iTunes library?
I have about a day and a half just in iTunes music LOL
and that's like 5% of my total music
about 1m above ground
how do u have it on the bottom?
6meh
using the sticker pads that came with my wii
umm... so you taped the top of it?
i have it top mounted on my 46", actually i just rest the bar on the actual tv
12rawra
the plastic stand thingy broke
and it works fine
mine was not working well when sitting on the floor
6breeeeee
i wouldn't think it'd work well when sitting on the floor
Soljarag, u just put the dualsided sticker pads on the bar and tucked it under the sony logo
it's supposed to be either directly above or directly below
it works fine now
12lol
well.. i have it on top now... but its wayyy off... I'm like pointing 3 feet higher than its showing
Soljarag: did you change the setting in the menu
to above the tv instead of below
yep
hmm, maybe try turning off the lights? i've noticed certain types of lights can interfere
bstock: me sitting on the floor, not the bar
ah
i sit on a futon to play
5cm above ground
i dunno... its really odd how much it is off
try put it below
the sticker pads work well
and the bar is only 2" from the screen
whe- oh
yeah.. i may have to rig something.... my screen has a wierd frame
philips?
i have the samsung
ah yea the new samsung have weird frames like philips
my friend has c650 40" samsung
my sony has a nice flat metal edge
bstock the plastic stand really is a joke
its so flimsy
yeah that's why mine just lays on the top of the tv heh
Soljarag, not sure if it suits ur needs but u can use candles instead of the bar
a girl i know does that
ha, really?
yea
thats funny
4SPLIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
two candles
Orly?
the "sensor bar" is just two IR lights
yeah.. i think tv's should have them built in...
Kyu split script = busted :3c
heh
hey guys have a noob question not involving wii but whats the difference between x64 and x86 i'm wanting to dl a program but which i should get
x86 isfor 32bit
x64 is 64bit
get the one corresponding to ur windows version
ohhey the chat didn't explode :D
XD
well... it worked great when i had my tv on the stand.. and i had it below the tv....
so ill have to rig something to put it below it./..
hot glue it :P
actually if the frame is not flimsy plastic that will work well
ha
There we go? oAo
minisplit :D
6and wow, that was ocean that went down

that's CGI:IRC
not Mibit
*mibbit
but I was using mibbit o-o
that's a rear projection tv, sxrd
6unless this is something I'm completely blind to....

what way
yea also looks to sterile to me
6mibbit, connect to ocean.systemnet.info:6667
the whole "altar"
6up until recently, it worked
12Lugia is leaving tomorrow v____v
I do ocean.lugia.us
no port number
ha
yeah.. replace it with a LED
dunedude: not all rear projection is bad, new dlp tv's are rear projection and they're still nice
*oh yay
Reshiraaaam O:
all dlp is rear projection
/me torch
and they're not that nice
XD
yeah but it's a far cry from the old 60" rear projection tv's, with like a 6Â° viewing angle
12cough
led sux for games
they lag
but they're no where near as good as a Kuro
i tested like 5 up to 4000eu range
if you don't mind settling for a tv, I guess dlp is ok
they're also prob 1/5 the price
CRTs ftw
well, buy all means, save some money then
i had a crt-hd until recently
i have 2-yr-old lcd and it's fine for me
a 50
nice for non hd consoles
I imagine alot of things are "fine for you"
good up to 720p
lol so anything other than top of the line is shit? riiight
a 50" crt would need a metal reinfored stand
i had 32" crt-hd it weighed 50kg
bstock: ONLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE sONY IS GOOD
oops
darn caps lock
anyone use a wireless sensor bar?
think you picked up his point of view pretty well
Soljarag i do
how long do batterries last?
no, there are good values out there, I just don't find rear projection to be one of them, base on its inherant weaknesses
Soljarag: we had some at work, were fine, but annoying to change batteries
I feel panasonic plasma are a great value
and have to turn them on all the time
ya Soljarag the batteries don't last very long
but just get rechargeable and u are good to go
I think there are only a couple of companies that even make rear projection anymore anyways
Plasma has a shorter lifespan doesn't it?
no
plus with rear projection, have to occasionally buy bulbs as well
you have a wii at work?? where do u work?
bestbuy
Soljarag: no, we used wiimotes and a sensor bar though for custom application
ha, ok
???
actually in some of the offices though we didn't even need the sensor bar, because the flourescent lights provided enough IR so that from the desk it worked perfectly heh
wierd

is it possible to downgrade 4.3 back to 4.2
if u were on 4.2 b 4
and it was modded
u can go from 4.3 to 4.1
it was not modded
only by dvd drive chip
thats boo
?
hehe
meaning no not as far as i know
there is a way to do a 4.3 virgin
but its not 100% safe i think i dunno
im on 4.1
ok
friend brought a 4.3 to me
dumbass
? list
not you but him
lol
? downgrade
i know
can anyone recommend me some fun multiplayer games?
i just got my wii 2 days ago, wanna get some fun multiplayer games that me and my girl can play
carnival games
boom blox
party games 1 and 3
2 SUX
hmm
any of the Mario series
? downgrade
bor: np its and easy q to awsner the wii is 90% multi player
also 90% junk tho ;)
haha
naw more like 40% junk
30% kids bs
i just had to buy one when i saw a mario galaxy 2 review and a preview of nba jam
nba jam?
nba jam will come out for all systems
who is making that?
acclaim is dead and so is Midway
a german ratings board rated nba jam for 360/ps3
yea i read that rumor few days back
http://wii.ign.com/objects/056/056365.html Watanuki
ah EA Sports
hey question
14ty
np
14aaaaaand brb again
my wii 4.1u is Korean and presoftmodded, it runs USBloader GX, i am new to softmodding and worried about fkin up my box
so i saw CFG USB loader
and the menu and coverflow of the GUI looks sick
basically my question is this, if i install cfg usb loader, is there a chance i can brick my wii?
rofl no
you dont "install it" like you think you do... you just put it in the apps folder
lol
yea
oh ha
all u "install" is a forwarder
so installing homebrew like that or a channel, doesnt modify anything to the wii's OS that can brick it?
nope
cool
there are bannerbricks if you install wads from weird sources
yeah im just gonna go by wiihacks or gbatemp sources
does cgf usb loader have an option to download covers like usbloader gx has?
yes
yes
sweet
and cfg reads ntfs/fat32
is there any reason i shouldnt force NTSC for all games in config.txt (CFG Loader)? seems like if i force NTSC on US games it works fine, and I need to force NTSC for PAL games. so why not just force all in the config.txt?
because some games adverslty react to it
so does usb loader gx right? it said so on the release page, eventhough i never got it to work on fat32
sure you can
well of one game does he can change it
if*
yea, id rather have to change the few games it adversely affects
kinda sucks that i have been ripping about 25 DVD games to a WBFS HDD in the last two days
bor_venin: you can rip back to the computer from the wbfs hd, though i prefer having a wbfs partition since games ripped to wbfs are scrubbed and therefore smaller
arent .wbfs files on NTFS scrubbed and just as small?
XD
14ty again
yes
oh perhapse, if that's the case then yeah no diff
or fat32
thought he was comparing to just raw isos

12Updated, Roara
12Thanks it's cute, I prefer your other style though
6well, unfortunately, photoshop sucks
6I can't deal with it :|
12Why did you use it then? XD
6I have nothing else
6sai doesn't work well on a mac
12What happened to your Windows computer....?
04it got trashed?
/me hides
12why can't you just use that for art?
welll, it was windows?
6arti, my old computer is so eaten by viruses right now it wont work
6as soon as dad wipes it, he's taking it for good
12*sigh* So you're stuck with a mac
6because "I don't need to laptops"
6oh gee, thanks for cheering me up
04"I don't need to laptops"
04lol
12You can install XP on it you know
6yes, but I need a legit XP OS don't I?
no
8D
/me is having fun learning C==
*C++
12Can't comment, but I'd assume it would work with a regular, haxed XP bootable CD
6I'd like to avoid that...if dad finds out I hacked something like that, i'm as good as dead
not really haxed, you just need a serial number
6besides, dad just payed for my photoshop
6and also, I royally sucked with sai when I first got it
6it just takes a bit of practice
12Well, I can help you know
6with?
12I could easily copy your SAI style with Photoshop
12with photoshop of course
6hmm
6which style?
6the ones for the free images?
12http://www.lugia.us/media/art/free/fearow.gif
12Just like that
derp
12Infact I could copy the head right now provbably
6I'm sure I could too, it's just taking me some time to find my way around
I have about 6 legal win XP keys if you are interested ovO
XIII_USA_NGC_WORKING_iNTERNAL_For_Wii-OneUp ....wtf is that?
12Like I said, I can help you some time if you like, it's way easy when you know how
i can't find anything for XIII in gamestop
or anything
is it that old cell shaded game?
6out of curiosity....why do you have 6?
6o-o
Everytime I go to someone to fix their computer, I copy their serial key XD I am not 100% sure, but windows allows a single serial key to be used up to 30 times ^v^
6....
yes
6really?
cell shaded shooter
/me 6should go find her XP cd
Well, I had 16, but I format my computer every 3 months and now only 6 remains due to over use ^^'
but..it was also a GameCube Game
...
It's still only a GC game.
XIII_USA_NGC
Those OneUp releases are just the gamecube games with the garbage data kepot intact. They serve NO purpose.
6failure
lol yep
/me yawns

The same rules apply as if it were a regular gamecube release.
10anyone played dragon quest ix?

Arti is just uploading ^^'
Yes, you can ply it from disc, no to the USB loader.

7Hai.
6thanks for showing me
12But see, you can do everything SAI can do :3
6I know very well that photoshop can do it
10hi quan
6my point is that I'm still trying to find the right brush settings for everything
6that and it's been a while
7That you do in three minutes takes me ten. D:
12Ok, when Im not going to bed, I will show you XD
12I have to go..

When i try to run all the new games (mario galaxy 2, and wii party (jap) i get a message on the screen after opening the DVDR thru the Disc Channel which says An error has occured. Press the eject button remove the game disc and power off. Is there a solution to this to use games in the disc channel still ?
it loaded fine thru neogamma
but i prefer disc channel for some of the less apt users in the home
you can try !dict instead
I think that method requires darkcorp

what are you trying to do ?
mod his wii for weeks ;)
:(
have you TBR an ios236 ? (or ios36 ) ?
7o3o
are you still without HBC ?
is there any reason i was banned from this channel when i joined from mibbit?
<viince> no
shadow give me link to wad file for ios 36
to install
and i done it
I have better guide for 36 (for 236 instead)

shadow
assassins, I FUCKING GAVE U WHAT U FUCKNG NEEDED
NOW GET THE FUCK TO IT
hi i did what u said butafter that the hbc went to black screen
reinstall it
i did shadow
its probably cuz the trucha bug is messed up or some shit like that
reinstall the channel
install from wad manger
how i instal the channel
get the hackmii installer
google it.
bootmii.org
wait...
ios 36 is supposed to be original, so that the homebrew channel runs on it
i think...
dont take my word for it
:9
you can install ios236 (for installing other ios's) and keep ios36 untouched
:(
all what i want only to play games from usb
but, first you need HBC it sounds like.
okay okay...
when i tryto re install hbc from wii data mangment channels
ios 36 should not be part of playing games from usb
olso wii freez
wtf,? you put hbc on sd menu ??
yes
can someone please hlep me with somthing small, just trying to get game channel forwarders to work that all
okay assassins
all this proplem coz i try to install ios to ply games from usb
your doing something very very wrong.
shit is nuts
lol
its so much better
you can have full box art
front and back, disc too
so i founfd hack me installer tell me can not contenue coz i have un known reliable ios
looks so clean
i have loaders working i know about that
dont know whyd youd want every game as a channel
i just want them in a channel on the main menu
yeah thats cuz you installed a cIOS36
dude.... you messed up
can u tell me what to do plz
and im not good enough, or patient enough to help you
sorry
lol
lol
ohh man
maybe a nand restore is in order....I'd try DOP-Mii to restore ios36 first
thxx
how i use all tat while iam unable to log into hbc
!!!
uhm....
did you install priiloader yet ?
nop
do you have bootmii?
just ios 36 that shadowgive me
no
prob not
ouch
i think i see a wii system update in your future
just tell me steps i well foloow
im not sure though
do u have a receipt within 30 days?
thats your next bootmii a reciept ( :
xD
huh
?
he means
return your wii
:0
:)
or update it and wait for 4.3 to be hacked again.
thx
bad idea
yeah
shadow
i sugest you dont update
guys how is it that i can install everything up to now working fine except for game channel forwarders for my wii games lol
good to see shadow he knows
plz telle mwhat to do
we dont know what to do.
your screwed.
shadow who told me to install ios 36
yes i did
ok
after i install it
maybe you did it wrong shit happens
because that most time fixs the no vonerable ios
for hackmii installer
yes ok
after i did
hbc frezz
you may have more issues then just that cant reinstall old nand?
shadow are you sure you gave him an original ios 36?
yes he did
and start over or make a new nand from app
yes i did
v1042
shadow can u tell me how to re install hbc again?
bannerbomb
ok give me link
google it
for 1 u know
first site will be it
on google
k
any idea about game forwarders why i may be getting an error
game forwarders?
assassin, ? softmod
ya
like a game channle for a wii game
v1 - compatible with Wii Menu version 3.0 - 4.1
v2 - compatible with Wii Menu version 4.2 (only)
gay
that u can launch from the main menu
gay
why is it gay
waste of space
umm
im not using the space for anything else
? list
they take up like 6 blovksds
u only have 512MB and wii menu is int aht space too
O:
i have 1680 free
/me floof
dude
so u dont play ww/vc?
i use my 500 gig to store most things
? bannerbomb
all my wii space otherwise i have saved on sd in front
ya
/me collapses
so u take space up with ww/vc
on my 2 gig i have all the vc i need and rb 2 tracks and still have 600 mb free
u have to have space to laod ww/vc off sd
it gets laoded into the space then ran
ya and i have plenty
its not purly running off the sd card
yo i know this i installed a wiikey first day they came out and have done everything ever since no issues just asking how to get them to work
i can care less for them to be working
because its pointless
when usb laoder is all u need
umm its not pointless if it works...
and has the covers and all
and it works
usb laoder cfg
i know i use that with a channel forwarder as wel
then carry on useing it
i like the look of games in their own box ):
exactly
nice box art in cfg
ya like on the menu not through loader, exactly
and can see front and back :)

we can't help you
those steps lead to piracy
do you know where i can get help?
it's not up to me
yes and no
telling you would be helping you
lol
thanks your awesome
he would've kbed you right away
unelss we summon him
lol
haha i was just kidding
:P
your name sounds like warbles
if you want to direct people to gbatemp i dont mind
lol
warbles!
!kban arimil
hehe :)
ughh
i'm -.-
give it the fuck up
hah
/me rages.
/me uses FLOP instead. It's super effective!
misty: you're a water pokemon expert, control that thing
quick i need a line wrap function
why?
to word wrap text
just write one
its like 4 lines
u can always direct them to another channel to get them out of here
what there's no way word wrap is 4 lines
if the line is longer than a set amount (the length of the line), replace the previous space with a \n
how is that much longer than 4 lines?
do it in pseudocode
hey Austin
oh let's say you don't have \n
hows it been going?
why would you not have \n or endl or something?
then it's not possible
cause GRRLIB_PrintfTTF doesn't have it
it's not an IO stream
i've written one wordwrap before
it's ugly and gross
it's in FLM
i'm jus thinking of a better way to do it
k, in java its still the same....just instead of \n you just increment the y value by a set amount
http://code.google.com/p/fmylife/source/browse/trunk/FMyLife/source/fmylife.cpp
scroll down to... drawText()
that's pretty much how i have to do it
i can simplify it a little now
since i can get the width of a line of text
still gotta break the line of text into words
that looks roughly how i'd do it...
i dont see how thats all uber complicated though ;P
lol it's just ugly and > 4 lines
i can make roughly the same method in java in half the lines xP
java is easier
i have StringTokenizer
stringtokenizer is dumb
ever since scanner came out, tokenizer is antiquated
or scanner
or whatever it's been awhile
i forgot what i used
strings are a pain in c++....one of the reason its not exactly my language of choice
man segoeui is sexy
oh, and re: 4 lines....i bet its right around there when using java and regular console output ;P
course it also depends on what you consider a "line"
ill just put that entire drawText() func on one line and claim its way shorter than you say :D
i guess i could just make a lookup table
lol
damn its been forever since ive written something decent in java or php.....i want to write something but i got nothing useful to write
http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Comcast-BitTorrent-Ares-eDonkey-FastTrack,10839.html
lol, sounds like me. I read up on html, c++, php, but not sure what to actually write.
now learning c#
yeah. all the cool stuff ive wanted to write....ive already written or would take far longer than i wish to spend to do it by myself xP
how big is a char again
u8?
u16?
a char in ascii is 8 bytes
unicode is 16
You mean 8 bits?
yes
hmm yes indeed
although unicode is more than 16 bits i think ja?
16 bit
looking at my c# study guide
utf-8 is extendable to 4 byes, actually
0-65535
UTF-8 (which uses one byte for any ASCII characters, which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters)
thats why its represented by 4 hex chars
FFFUUU buffer overrun
so its 0-65534 xP
wait no youre right
this is what i get for having a shitty professor for this crap
hahaha
it's 0-65535
yeah
65536 different chars
although.....
Yeah. using a unsigned int
If I was wrong, then this book would be wrong, lol.
its 32 bits though...4 bytes....max though
what's wrong with this
http://pastebin.org/391601
night all
Gandalph: given the atrocities ive seen in my data structures and structure of programming languages books...i wouldnt be surprised
i mean $16 mil for the class action suit is shit! got to be more than 1,000,000 people who have comcast during that period. not to mention lets say less have filed suit
Yeah I've seen a few messed up books.
should be entitled to a lot more $
oh look we have a Node....lets make its left and right children both public!
Isn't it 2 hex = 1 byte. 4 bit per hex
stupid pieces of crap
comcast just doesnt want to pay out
i don't really see anything wrong
nevermind
:/
i know hwat i did wrong
what?
yeah
I dunno. I don't know much about it. I only pasted it to inform Comcast customers that they have a free $16 waiting for them.
okay i don't know what i did wrong
all i know
it's hanging on that part
wait
Oh, they paid out. It just went mostly to the lawyers, as it always does in class-action suits.
hmmmmmmmm
3 million to lawayers it said
is it GRRLIB_WidthTTF's fault?
$13 to customers
http://grrlib.santo.fr/doc/group___all_func.html#ga0d6122453e44eca5d0defaa66d01b55b
maybe
mill*
1 hex can represent 16 chars, and 16^4 = 65536, so all 4 bytes should be in there
less than a million customers
so weak
no
oh wait
you FAIL
lol
4 bytes is ~4 billion
utf-8 is 32 bits..........2^32=4294967296
so its 0 -4294967295
/me chex his comcast stock
$16m is enough. Nobody will ever do that again now. That's the real result of the lawsuit for most of us.
and the 4-hex notation represents the first 65536 im guessing
I mean, let's say you were throttled. It was lame, but what real harm did it cause you? You got your porn 5 minutes later than you should have?
idk...im starting to care less and less tbh xP
okay i figured out what was wrong
WidthTTF chokes on char values < 32
im a software engineer, not a hardware engineer :P
Hmm. Perhaps they could have afforded more after all. "Total equity $ 42,721 million (2009)"
and i dont plan to ever write compilers or create new languages or stuff like that....so XD
i have
its' fun stuff
ever try to write to run an interpreted language
with only 3 8-bit registers
it's not fun
it drives you mad
INSANE
ive written in assembly....that was pain enough for me
have you written in 6502 assembly
MAD I TELL YOU
im not sure what assembly it was tbh
6502 assembly sounds familiar. I think I read an online study guide for that a couple years back for the heck ot learning it.
From what I'm reading, utf-8 is 8 bit (hence utf-8). utf-32 would be 32 bit, utf-16 being 16 bit. could be reading it wrong (wiki)
Gandalph: utf-8 is expandable to 4 bytes depending on the character
/me <3 6502 assembly
6502 is what was used in nes
yup
NO YOU
i wrote for nes
it's awesome
mad? MAD?
http://members.shaw.ca/jparasite/lol6502/stdlib.65s
not too easy, but fun
for nes, wasn't that assembly I read then.
aww, all it needs is comments
i wrote that
it's not even done yet
i went MAD
well why are you writing so much?
that's just the standard libary
it was for a compiler's class
porting c or something?
oh
i made an LOLCODE to 6502 compiler
hah
6502 is nice
wanna see my pong? :P
pong is awesome
i'm working on picross
Gandalph: nah, its a different standard i believe
if i'm using wchar_t
and my pong has 12a06r14t09i06f03i08c05i14a11l 09i08n14t06e05l10l08i08g03e08n14c08e04!
how do i tell this stupid thing
to switch to a different language
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4355351/tpwpong.nes
like "USE JAPANESE CHARSET" or whatever
I'm playing picross 3d. challenging.
eek
is it safe to delete the hackmii folder on the sdcard?
didn't we ban you earlier
yup
lol
utf-32 is a constant 32 bits....theres probably other differences too, but i dont feel like looking them up because im in the middle of watching degrassi xP
- !kban ban evasion
question isn't related to that though its about hackmii
I'm watching hell's kitchen :)
or rather the folder says bootmii
If you don't want to use bootmii, then delete it. ;)
bah
why does charmap show "!" as 33
but in printf it's 32
oh nevermind
i'm ertarded
32 is SPACE
also once it's modded I don't need the boot file anymore do i?
Depends if you want to boot into bootmii or not, should something go wrong.
best to just rename the folder.
well if it does i could just take the sdcard out and put the files back on my pc right?
anyone want to test my test app
You could have 2 SD cards
sure
iirc tho
i'm trying to get unicode to work
you can config it to automatically boot the sysmenu
so it's just a loop that shows a bunch of characters
bootmii folder is only a few kb in size. no need to delete.
from 32 to 512
having to get up every time the system gets turned on to press the reset button is a pain :p
use autoboot
there's an .ini file
uncomment out the autoboot
rename the folder then.
wouldn't that defeat the purpose of it being there though? since you can't use it then
*shrug* i guess
autoboot it is :p
Arimil: you can press a certain button and it'll boot into it
with autoboot on
thought the wiimote didn't work in there
do you know how unicode is handled
when GET an html page
Arimil: no no I mean
with a gc controller or on the wii buttons
like hold the eject button while turning it on?
yeah
or reset
idk which
i'm just trying to think
if i do a GET using sockets
ok thanks everyone
the data is transferred byte for byte
Oh, by the way, I decided to pick back up on C++ studies
i'm just thinking, "how do i parse that"
right. strings arent parsed, just byte by byte
C++ studies
Oh, by the way,
I decided to pick back up
lol
what's that? i went to back up my hard drive
>_<
lol
oh no, where did my back up of my files go
i lost my only hard drive back up
!rules
it's cause you're voiced
:D
If you go on record saying you use p2p, you can get $13?
can i get a voice
and opped (if i want)
lolwut
	are a regula helper you may be promoted to have voice and should we
	need more ops we will promote from there
i am totally a regular helper
you may be
:D
lol, back to development, who wanted to run this again
sonic?
I /try/ to be a regular helper. :P
I'll run it. What's the app now?
i regularly......enforce rules XD
btw
it just shows unicode chars from 0x20 to some value
C++ sucks
let me upload it somewhere
do you have wiiload?
I do
I set it up just the other day
:D
what the hell
Wow
it includes the .ttf file i guess
i don't know how big that is
the .ttf file is 500kb
$16!
http://www.mediafire.com/?u5mcqkliyu4
it should show a white screen with black text
"It was Ubuntu ISOs. Really."
3million in lawyer fees
i'm trying to figure out
how html will be sent to my app
Okay
Lemme load up the HBC
"Your honor, comcast records clearly show this user was using p2p for porn"
in my last version of FML
bunch of french characters weren't supported
or stuff like that
no no
like
wtf are you doing?
for this app?
yes
oh i just displayed a bunch of characters
that's all i wanted to see
if it would show up
it's just the chars from 0x20 to 0x1FF
no, what's the point of figuring all this out?
i'm still lost
like why the word wrapping?
what do you need that for?
oh, because i grab text from a website
and display it
need to wordwrap
there's no automatic wordwrapping whatsoever
oh
what program?
didn't you do fml?
www.wiibrew.org/FMyLife/
yes
this is what i'm fixing
just use the one from that
so in the next version i'm trying to get unicode to work
Okay
The text shows up
perfect
I see symbols
The alphabet
good good
And abunch of other letters that I don't care to learn about
:P
hmm...
well segoeui doesn't look like it has other language support
gonna try simsun
Okay
all this text makes me want to try something
text talk*
haah do somethign
make a program
(format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "
test"
ok, how did that display
uhh?
no like
paste all of what I did
oh cool =D
ERC> /l (format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline)
(format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "^M
	 PRIVMSG #wiihelp :test"
Hmmm, I really wanna try making a program
that's what I really did
Oh boy
Yeah, I think I understand all the new stuff I learned today
seriously
I could teach you
I'm doing classes on freenode soon
:O
Sign me up, plz
they already did python classes
:( damn, I missed out on that
there's logs....
Okay
Yep

oic
I'm looking at the first logt
*log

there's gonna be no asian language support
irc is mafia status.... lol i see the same @ps in here as #xbox #fw #whatever

Most homebrew apps are open source, right?
most
but not all
some of the really neat ones aren't
Ah okay
I plan to look at some of the source code in some apps
To get a feel for what homebrew dev on the Wii is like :P
03off to bed
it's easy
I hope so
ops u mean?
yea because they r apart of the same group
then the 2 groups has friends in each so they get ops over there and visa versia
oh hey Galaxy|, what's up? how's it been?
so so

I guess that's good
ughh this wordwrap

/me rages

oh wow, that really WAS ban evasion

Mmhmm?
obai imma goz0rz
Mario.Kart.USA.Wii-QwiiF
no
stay
I'm going to attempt to construct a little game for the Wii
we will miss the fun of u :(
what game
Just a little text adventure, if possible
I can at least try\
you can
actually
write it up
i can probably implement it
if you put some thought into it
All right
I'll try
i can use it to test this JKLASLKJDA wordwrapping
FU WORDWRAPPING
FU TO HELL
:P Okay
Well, the Hello World template is in C, it looks like
D:
Can't I just write it in C++ :(
?
sure
why not
night
you can
night yo
Night
All right
Let's do this
PROBABLY
Yeah
someone go msg him lol
Perhaps I should've asked what his definition of softmod was
I was going to ask it
you just can't say softmod
we dont ban on "they MIGHT be breaking a rule"
Oh
or kick*
saying softmod is like a back up of warez piracy
hahaha
did you unban him
i'll tell him to come back in
hes only kicked, not banned
however, you might tell him that if he IS referring to piracy, ill kban him myself next time ;P
? downgrade
bah
what you meant by softmod
if it's piracy softmod then no
hehe
if it's homebrew softmod then yes
softmod backup warez ios cios wakinkino
the definition of "softmod" is in the rules...so read them, and your speaking of softmod from henceforth will be assumed to use that definition
ok im confused
i'm trying not to say soft*mod
speaking/usage
haha
say the wii had the cioses pre installed
that's bad soft*mod
waht are you trying to do
get rid of it?
anyways i found my ans and a nice tut to do it
well 249 i believe
wee youre a pirate
byebye now
-.-
but do make sure next time plz ;P
he went to zzz
thats fine lolz
ughh i should sleep
gotta get up at 6:30am

no 57
249> base ios> network install
check dopmii
waht base did u install to?
ok
u foinaly said
u should of installed to 38
Choose IOS249 (or your trucha patched IOS36 if you dont have any cIOS installed yet)
3) The Installer will ask you what base IOS you would like to choose. Choose IOS57 and let the Installer finish the job. If you dont have a Internet Connection,
i have a 36 patched
u should of installed to 38
i did 57 and internet
u should of installed to 38
wii fucked now ?

to test the ports
usb port is correct

no
on other wii it never asks me to choose 249 or 222 in usbloader
then put your sd card in his wii
since its etup already and try
i put his sd card in mine and it works
mine is exactly the same
like i said test the ports
i did with microphone
or you did something wrong with installing 249
works
ok
it asks me to choose from 249 or 222 in usbloader menu
delete 249
and reinstall
other wii doesnt ask thatr
how

Macs aren't as bad as he thinks

hi all. I have a question about the homebrew channel. If i press 2 in the hb channel i get only icons nicly lined up. Is it possible to make it to be that way always?
I don't think so, I might be wrong though
Don't think so either
Damn i like it that way :)
want to see if all :80 traffic is down, or just dns
66.102.9.147
if you find it's DNS, Google's DNS servers are on 8.8.8.8

Clone
Trying to test something
anyone ehre?
Hmmm
Doesn't work
yes.
can i download games here or is it jsut the wii firmwares and stuff?
13in black?
I've been using HBC for a while, since probably a few months before the freeloader was killed. However, I've been keeping versions of the firmware up to date as well so I could continue to use the shopping channel and use the updated SD channel, etc.
you cannot get games here.
Nope
ok
thank yu
Try again
you*
13-\
I'm not updating to 4.3, obviously, until HBC is updated at least, or perhaps never
Now
there are shop channel updaters that just update the shop channel and the required IOS
Hmmm
then you are still able to use HBC and the shop channel
I understand there are a few programs I can use to update shopping channel without the firmware -
yeah, that
and if you are on 4.x already, you also keep the sd menu
13okay eonity
I want Mario Kart Banana hack :p
we don't deal with warez
and your problem is?
this is an 'informational' chat
13you did it again eonity
wiibrew wiki warns against using any of them, as they make permanent changes to the system, or mentions I need to use something to downgrade first so I can install them
damn, I thought it was a sex chat
At one point it's mentioned that I should have a backup just in case I brick my console, but I don't have a clue where to even start with this kind of thing, or which of the updaters is recommended
KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
/me puts away his mario thong
if you are still on 4.1, your brick risk by updating is higher than the risk when using one of the shop channel updaters
Indeed, I read the rules. I'm not asking for a backup, or how to pirate things
KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
/me 13uses dig
i think it just looks for the word
do a nand backup with BootMii
WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
ah
Is this script supposed to go into Remote or Users>
*?
14Remote lol
ehe
Are you able to install BootMii to boot2 with the hackmii installer?
/me 13hugs
as far as I know, I installed bootmii when I updated HBC a few months back
you can install it to boot2 and as IOS
they are both different things
as for using it to backup, I'd need to find instructions
KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
OK
and BootMii IOS is next to useless for 99% of people
Nope
lol
i still recommend creating a nand backup with it, but don't ever try to restore it unless you have BootMii boot2
WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
Fail
I think I'm on 4.2, I'm not sure
I... should go check
I wonder
back up
KBK: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
dang, I tried
Maybe it's the variables
I'll be back in a few secs
13Hey Quany
I'm on 4.2E
I don't see why the ship channel updaters would require the trucha bug/a patched IOS
so I should first and foremost look up instructions on making a b@ckup with bootmii
just in case I explode something
1st thing you should do is checking if you can get BootMiit boot2, or if you have it already
OK try again
so just run the hackmii installer(works from HBC as well)
and see what it says
...
about doing the bakkup, start BootMii(there's an option in HBC for it) and navigate trough its menu to actually do the backkup
It stores the bakup on the SD?
it uses the reset, power and eject button for navigation, but you can use a GC controller as well if you have one
yes
cool
And yeah, I have GC controllers in abundance
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail
Does the process take very long?
Do you know?
If BootMii doesn't show up when selecting it in HBC, you either don't have BootMii IOS installed, or the files are missing on sd card
in both cases, just reinstall it
10-20 minutes maxy
it's possible that updating to 4.2E removed it... though I know that's been circumvented in recent HB updates
i last updated my wii with 3.2u is there anypoint in going with a newer firmwar?
13LOL
fail
just fail
/me latches onto himself and starts nibbling non-stop.
if you used the official way to udate, then BootMii IOS was deleted, but you can always just reinstall it(when you are on 4.2 or lower)
BootMii boot2 would also have been deinstalled, but would also be posible to reinstall(and highly recommended)
once I've done that - is there a shop (and other) channel updater that you've personally used or like?
no, i'm not using the ship channel
not unless a game requires it...and right now there aren't any afaik
ok
and i have plenty patched IOS, so i maybe wouldn't notice if the installer requires it or not
you can just try them
worst case should be a broken shop channel until you found a working installer
i dont wanna bother with it if its unnecessary
fair enough
Thanks for listening, I'm not sure how borderline this is to the rules, or how often people come to ask similar stuff
i can't stress it enough that the nand bakkup will only do you any good if you have BootMii boot2 or a hardware nand programmer
rbr
with skipping the oddicial update, and the shop channel installers, we are perfectly within the rules of this channel
of course
or the rules on WiiBrew which are basically the same
I have that highlighted on my notes
is your wii chipped or softmodded?
softmodded
I'm fine with installing HBC and things like that, but stuff that could potentially corrupt things is beyond my experience so far
whats the point of chipping it?
......
10not that word
/me shot
as long you don't have any patched IOS installed, i would say it's difficult to brick the wii
playing burnt backups, gc games
i do both
..
if it's softmodded, then I'd use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide...at the end you'll be on 4.1...which is the place to be
Someone else try it
most stuff you read where people bricked their Wiis on purpose(stupidity), they used patched IOS, without them the apps that bricked wouldn't been able to do "their job"
but whats the point of going from 3.2 to 4.1 if no games require it?
I can't remember but I think the vars are messed up before it has been used once
...
stuff like deleting IOS, system menu, install corrupted channels etc. is not directly possible on a Wii with 4.2 system menu
K try again
does anyone here have an i4 im wondering if the signal issues are over exaggerated or not?
oops sorry
not enough sleep apparently
this should probably be done somewhere else
4.1 fixes a bug in wii sports resort
nope
ah, here it is
maybe a #test
i dont play it anyways becasue i dont have the addon for the controller i forget what its called
"warning: Using dop-shop makes permanent changes to NAND and should be used with caution"
motionplus
motion plus
ANYWAY
THIS DOESN'T WORK.
i was on 3.2 for the longest time
there ay go
ya*
with priiloader and all games working
cept havent played any wiimotion plus crap
not sure if i installed the preloader
gtg
you could even delete both without getting any trouble
preloader is outdated...it's now priiloader
4.1 has a bunch of updated ios files and seems to be more stable
D:
that april fools joke really pissed me off
been to long since ive used my wii
which is something i have heard of yet
i gotta find some goodgames
n't*
lol
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSCU
might be the better option, i don't know why dop-shop says it needs a trucha bugged IOS
still worst case: it just doesn't work
ooh, I think I looked at this one before
Cool
Well, it's 2am here (Australia), and I'd prefer to be rested before I attempt something here, so as to not miss any vital steps or instructions. I appreciate the help and I may be back if things go horribly wrong and I need help
thanks again, goodnight
just get back here then
there sure will be somebody who is able to help you
awesome. I'll make sure to be here before I start so I can dive for the computer if something looks like it's going wrong
oops

um
what do you mean ringtone maker?
dont know

if you just use MIDIs
just put them on the phone
o.o
a website that makes ringtones?
if you want mp3s
go download Audacity
and do it yourself
7Yes, I meant MP3s; all right, DRF, I guess.
don't use websites
they make terrible quality
just remember this: most phones go to voicemail after 25 seconds, so that's how long the ringtone should be.
just cut it down in Audacity, save it as mp3 (you might need the lame_enc.dll file)
transfer it to phone

I had a mail from an ebay seller in my inbox...about some of the pokemon staging in the 13th movie as plush....
o.o
a shiny Entei plush - a really small plush
buy-now $599
12what can i say
12entei is popular
12there's a pokemon card whose value is beyond estimation lol
Shiny Raikou and Shiny Suicune - same price
i know
o___O
12someone managed to buy the card for like 12,000 dollars
12USD
that's more than my car
._.
LOL
prolly same here
my car has no trade-in value
so I dunno how much it would sell for
lol
i'm getting a new one in like
well this is new to me
a couple of days i suppose xD
12http://pokegym.net/forums/showthread.php?t=32583
it's my dad's old SUV
12all the info is there
Mercury Mountaineer, from 2000
back when it first came out
like a month ago he bought a Cadillac for him
and gave my sister and me his SUV
so :)
either a 2006 saab 9-3 or a 2007 accord
lol
LOL Saab
I actually like Honda
just that the Mercury drives completely different
so I finally got used to driving that
then last night I took my mom's Honda Odyssey minivan
and was like "Frick, how do I use this thing"
XD
XD
i'm used to a dodge
avenger
i tried driving my dad's Prius and
yeah ><
LOL
Never drove a Prius.
who makes those anyway?
Toyota
ah
I'm not a big Toyota fan
but Honda, I liek their cars
Neither am I lol
It like...
lags
I've driven a Civic, those are pretty nice
when you hit the accelerator
6Testing, testing.
heh
6Yay, it works.
check, check, 123
"flooring" it takes 5 seconds to go
LOL
Also wb
srsly
see, the thing with my mom's Honda
it accelerates just as fast as anything else
you just have to push harder on the petal
how they speed up superfast
but apparently some people like that?
I got used to it LOL
lol
the Avenger does that
I mean, I got used to it
but I learned to drive in a Honda
so I was all FFFF whenever I'd drive a Ford/GM/Chevy
I don't mind it, it's not like flooring a sports car but eh
er Chrysler
w/e
lol
lag
I was never really a car person
like as long as it has 4 wheels and the engine works it's fine with me
but one of my friends is a super car geek
and he taught me some stuff XD
I used to be car-obsessed a long time ago, talking elementary school lol
heh
but yeah I just want something that works and doesn't look like poo
well I don't have a parent that works for a car company
/me gets Altair's car in pimp my ride
so I was never ito them as a child
/me enters his dad's Prius in it :O
well neither did I XD
well it seems all too common
where soemone's parent will work for one of the big 3
so they grow up all into cars
I blame it on Hot Weels
eh
LOL Hot Wheels
see
I played with LEGOs
not those./
I played with Hot Weels, LEGO and K'nex or whatever it's called
LOL K'nex
I tried those once
and went back tO LEGO
I liked K'nex more than LEGO xD idk
heh
hi shadows
well you can do some legit amazing things with LEGO
Maybe because I had a solar powered set from knex lol
truely
I have a few of their robotics kits
I never had the programmable block and robotic kits etc
and I used to make cars out of them and stuff XD
like before I got the RCX even
I had a motor and a box that would go forward/backward
so I'd make makeshift RC cars
and use a really long wire
LOL
XD
here we go
I'd make these huge car-like things out of K'nex
got Android 2.2 running great on my Droid
:O
I just had to totally wipe it >_>
which is fine as I have a backup
Somehow there's a way
of course
I need to go download the software
to restore it
you can get Android on the iPhone
LOL
yes
LOL

13à² _à²  what did you say
go eat 2 dozen krispy kream donuts very 2 days
every*
I'm 6'0" and 141 pounds
start eatting alot of junk food
Not to you
and just want to get to 160
high in fat
Kingdom Hearts 3D is a sequel to Kingdom Hearts II
and it'll be on the 3DS
hows taht fat princess
deep fried foods
oh
13oh
so once AGAIN Sony doesn't have a normal series Kingdom Hearts this gen. :p
so that's another thing Sony doesn't have
13sorry
Naughty Dog trying to abandon the Crash Bandicoot series for friggen Uncharted
and also, let it be known, shooters are very low in my genre pereference.
Naughty Dog abandoned Crash many years ago. They only did the first 3 I think.
uncharted> crash
Then Jak and Daxter on the PS2.
yeah
it's dumb
brb on laptop
So, Klonoa, Crash, Spyro, and Kingdom Hearts (main series) are available on a nintendo console this gen
At least Kindgom Hearts 3(III)D will be launching with the 3DS
The days of console exclusives are ending.
uh there is nothign announced mainline kh yet
The costs of making a game far outweigh the costs of porting one.
so i dunno where u get that from
MB, yeah it was at E3
no it wasnt
It showed Kingdom Hearts 3DS, and it's been reported
a name on a list isnt not an announcement
that it's a sequel to Kingdom Hearts II
nothign about it bneing mainline
That's just storywise.
13i know why did britteny sing
all the stories link
13that song
well
There have been quite a few KH games on Nintendo systems. Nothing new.
Portables, that is.
on handhelds
yeah but on nintendo DS and the re-coded or 356/2 game...
yuck
altho i wouldnt be surprised to see a nintendo wii or wiihd kh
fits the demographic
Also a new Assassins Creed for the 3DS
13I'm going on a discovery flight this saturday
:o
13I'm going to need to fly FSX for some last minute practice
3DS is gonna rock.
2hm
13in a ceesna

barrel rolls. do them.
they should just skip the 3d sillyness, and boost the system's performance even more
/me does a barrel roll
Nuj
then it wouldnt have anythign distinguishing itself
u
But Peppy told me to do one D:
peppy is annoying
always has been
they just put it in for the lulz, you know?
better to distinguish it self with real features, than gimicks
didnt i hear that before
o yea
yeah, Peppy's more annoying than Slippy
around 2000 there was an ouburst of lil pop stars of brtney spears wannabes, if you remember
ds and wii
I actually don't mind Slippy
amd then they all disappeared
that certainly blew up in nintendos face
shoudl have dropped the "gimmicks" and go for power liek psp and ps3
and sel more units
o wait
games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
they sold less
Yeah, because that worked so well for Sony.
lke metoid prime hunters, and such
sony's problem is the price
Tarawa: You haven't played many DS games.
nope
<Tarawa> games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
Well, now
the slider pad fixes that problem!
Hey
for the 3DS
no, its still no where near as accurate as a nipple stick
well, not for DS games, since they already have the flaw
and you have to hold your hands at an un godly angle
the handheld department hasn't screamed out to me so much except for LOZ handheld games.
and the Sonic RPG. :D
talk about poor games
Well, I can't pass up on Zelda
and I can't pass up on a Sonic game and an RPG, so..Sonic...on an RPG?
Gotta go for it!
sonics been shit for years now
and the rpg oen is even worse
I really can't imagine why, just the fact that it's rpg makes it cool
Meh, I know they'll get it right though, lots of people say Sonic Colors is the bomb
zz
lots of ppl, who didnt play it
psh, from e3 :p
thats not lots
Plus, I like the show Sonic X.
and i recall them saying the same shit with unleashed :P
whats up
So, even if the gameplay is bad, I can get a Sonic X movie on a video game.
Since so far, Sonic, Tails, and Amy are confirmed chars so far in Sonic Colors...
12murr
evening a;;
*all
so basially they could sell u poo, as long as it has sonic on it u will buy? :P
howdy
Well, it has to meet criteria
spikey poo?
Not a spin-off part of the Sonic Series, and an actual considerable genre
like Platform, Adventure
and RPG is unpassable
if it's a handheld Sonic and it's not an RPG, it probably sux
so, 4.3 kills homebrew?
no
it kills hbc
and dvdx
ah
oh...
However, if I'm a fanboy of anything
I'd have to be a fanboy of Kid Icarus..
:D
homebrew in general is still acessible via indiana pwns and smash stack
ah, so if the title id for HBC and DVDX were changed, it'd work again?
=o
in theory?
i dont know about dvdx.....but the ios hbc uses has to be changed in addition....and then it would work, yeah
but it's not like anyone actually uses the shop channel anyway :P
I cried when I saw him say "Sorry to keep you waiting" at E3.
erm yeah, lots of people do
seriously?
why would they not?
i never have... all the old games on the shop channel are available through HBC emulators anyway
and the little indie games on the shop channel, i already have on the PC
if you would kindly READ THE FREAKING RULES, youd know we dont support piracy and therefore dont support games through emulators
12o-o
It's okay Pit *sniffles* I missed you so much for 19 years! I forgive you!
just to be irritating
lol
i own all the games that i have on roms.... i dumped most of them myself anyway.... so it's piracy
*not piracy
oops
!rules
xDC
!rules
1. NO PIRACY (or back-ups, don't go pretending, they are the same thing)! We're happy to help with getting the latest emulator to work but you'll be kicked (or banned) if you ask where to get ROMs etc. How to install VC / WiiWare games or asking where to get them will get you an instant ban as will asking for .ISOs or asking on support for modchips or any other piracy or backup-related topics.
it does seem vague, you're right...
hmm
TheDarkAc: btw, owning a game doesnt make it legal to download.....roms you dump yourself are another story, however
i only have roms from games i own though... i dumped all but the first sonic game, because my cartridge is screwed on that
The way I thought of it is that using an emulator is far more likely to be legitimate than using backed-up Wii games or WiiWare
only legal roms are self-dumped ones...period ;P
Espeon
zzz
And I'm good.
x3
yup, so i own 1 illegal rom then...
o3o
good to hear
for example, your old console may be broken, or you may have sold it, or you might not have enough room, or the TV standard in your area might have changed and your console not support the newer one
anyway
well, even if downloading games you own is illegal, it shouldn't really be - so I don't count it as piracy.
TheDarkAc: i really wish i had the equipment to dump my own roms sometimes....then again, id have to dig out all the games too xP
12o-O
12!ESPEON
http://i28.tinypic.com/29bexqx.png this is pretty much how I feel.
I need sleep also.
yeah, I wish I had that equipment
would be fun
2hm
LOL...since when do we go on the way things SHOULD be instead of the way things ARE?
I could buy a retrode, that would have Mega Drive, SNES, N64 and GB covered
bbl i guess....idk

lol
6Normal. :P
lucky :P
nice
6Just got a new load of work that keeps pushing my fanfic down. :|
i would dump my carts, except i'm too much of a wuss to mod my nes to do it
.-.
i did a slight deal with him... he'd let me dump my games, i'd repair his laptop in half the time it would have taken for the school technicians to do it (he may have been an it teacher, but he was LAZY as hell XD)
lol
2hm
2tats not good :(
10Hey Flame
Hey Flame
what hardwware was it?

13hey Flame
/me 13hugs
our school has no computer classes
it consists soley of the principal's son
it was 3 years ago... i honestly can't remember :S sorry.
genesis games?
i could just get a retrode
retrode needs to support nes
i'm too much of a wuss to install a copynes
though it's so long ago now I can't quite remember
hiya
well, either way....nobody really knows what constitutes a violation of what rule so we just kinda make crap up as we go along
I seem to remember I wrote a huge wall of text and someone else heavily abridged it to more or less what we have today
yeah
Hellos
anyway, i'm gonna have to go... i've got a review to work on on my website. if you wanna have a look, the site is http://soditaltf4.co.uk
cya
maybe the unabridged copy for ops or something? idk, but its rather annoying to find out channel policy.....isnt really channel policy
I have discovered a hilarious phrase book. Which if used by any one who doesn't know the languages... would result in much hilarity. :P
6Ovo
6Is it English as She is Spoke?
No, hte Zompist Phrasebook. :P
lol
!rules
13wow
Italian people speaking German? Does that work well?
nand backup
WiiPower: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
could somebody please change the script of the bot?
Another fun phrase: "Where is the Cathedral?" --> "Wo geht's 'n hier zum Puff?" = "How do I get to the brothel?"
Needless to say the mistranslations are very, very intentional. :P
lol
the rules seem fairly sane except for 1 and 3
!rules
1 not sane?
no, the thing is if we back up to back when it was created, it does the same thing
6LYON
3 not sane?
6D:
lol
well kind of vague
sane yes, clear.....far from it
oh I see
I thought you meant insane as in the rule shouldn't be there at all
lol
6Hmm.
6Whoo, I'm watching Wipeout for the first time in a year. O_o
is it good?
or boring
sane as in not clear and vague
/me pokes brother

would be more fun if the others would be serious
im offended! they dont have "his imperial majesty"
oh right
lol
i was originally going to say president because its in alphabetical order ;P
"Ops have the final word on what is and what isn't offtopic and offenders will be kicked and then banned"
WiiPower: thats off topic and you are now to be kicked and banned
:D
xD
6Brother: it's funny.
6Have fun with schadenfreude.
:P
Austin: thats off topic and you are now to be tarred and feathered

no, but you can be burned

its horse crap
i never cuss in here cuz ppl tell me not too
so i have replaced the "S" word with "crap"
any idea if they're targeting Giganews's servers?
Tarawa: All of the major ones except astra.
hmmmm
and what exactly are they targeting? all binaries and deleting things?
Someone(Nintendo?) is making them take all the posts off.
dmca, Tarawa
I have no idea exactly what that is
but I take it their deleting movies, games, and such?
No, just SMG2.
That I've noticed.
Pokemon and SMG2
My point is that it's not a mass wave of deletions of everything.
nintendo stuff I mean.
no it just seems to be the big core games.
heres the deal if ne1 needs mario galaxy 2... i found a REPOST
as this is the best game for wii prolly
there's an ocarina cheat that gives mario cerebral palsey, and the npc's turrets

If someone cares to pass on a message, WiiPower gave me some advice about installing updated shop channels without messing up homebrew, and how to backkup my system to protect myself. I followed the instructions and everything ran perfectly with no problems. Just wanted to say thanks

is there a working inject of Star Wars Shadows of the Empire?
i have an urge to play that game
viince, where have you seen dmca's hitting NG's?
haven't seen, just heard
from who?
ne1
whoever
when it disappears from all servers...what other conclusion do you reach ?
Evening all
who said something disappeared from all servers?
More silence. Just what u expected.
I*
idk, some peeps complained about it...
has anyone seen a wiiside configurator for cfg loader?
03XD
Idk if it was removed from ALL...or not
03so
03I upgraded my phone to Android 2.2
03works pretty well, though surprisingly not that many apps support moving to the SD card yet :/
Nice
How slow does it run :p
Ji
Jk*
03same speed as 2.1/
<viince> dmca takedowns ? what server are you using ?
<jc23> dmca takedowns ?
03why would it be slower
03I just need to configure Autoruns again
03becuase I have like over 9000 things that run whenever I Make a call >_>
it sounds like you said DMCA first
ng's have dmca compliance
and got everyone freaked out
viince...really
600mhz processors aren't as slow as they appear, I guess
read giganews dmca compliance
My own personal bottom line would be 1 ghz, but you've changed my mind
considering most news hosts keep servers outside of the US, where dmca's mean shit
03well
giganews != most
true
031GHz is only in like one phone
03AFAIK
03I can overclock mine to 900MHz
03I just don't
03because that wastes battery
03though meh
03the one thing that bugs me
No, it's on about 3 others now
what about a way to upload the config.txt without pulling the sd card?
03(and this may just be because it's not final yet)
giganews == biggest
03there's no longer a totally silent mode
03the "sound off" is now the same as "vibrate"
The new AT&T galaxy s
03so it will still vibrate...
ftpii ?
03I like dthe ability to turn *everything* off
giganews == most expensive
03heh
03w/e
03I mean
032.2 isn't even out for real on the Droid
It has a samsung 1ghz chip that's faster than an a4 in the iPad
03I used my rooted access to install a custom ROM
giganews != cheapest
03spent like 4 hours putting all my stuff back
03as it got erased obviously
giganews > most
i think that guy is just having issues finding a good copy of SMG2
I do that every month or so because my hardware sucks :p
On my touch
03heh
03well I don't
03...
03sigh
could be
And for that I envy you
But what am I to do
03"append SMS" doesn't actually append
03here's the thing
03I backed up my text messages before I upgraded
but that's still not the 1st time I've heard the complaint
03then when they got erased
03I left it alone
03now I have another 50 or so
Can't afford android until I get a job. Even then I will have more things to pay for like a car and my gaming hobbies
03so what to do...
03LOL gaming hobies
watch poker? o3o
03you could just start pirating
/me hides
How about NO
they can be compliant, but if they were truely acting on it, a lot more would be removed
not just SMG2
03fine, go broke
03if I could afford to buy everything I use, I would
TONS of stuff would
03most people pirate due to insane high prices
I also want to get deeper into anime, but that would cost a fortune
Plus card games
it seems like other articles have been removed at times...not Just that...but not TONs either
03how so
03so you HAVE to pirate it
such as?
movies
cause things disappearing could be a bad hdd on the server
I realize that
or other things
And that's why I'm not too deep into it
yeah, but I don't think the servers will advertise any dmca takedown actions
As I was saying, I also want to start collecting another set of cards
lol they are disappearing off usenet servers cause they are taking them off
they would
especially when they advertise 99.9% completion
smb2 .. lots of hbo shows are taken off giganews
The trading card arc right now is pokemon, yugioh, and magic
I have pokemon and I picked up a quite outdated magic deck at a thrift store
I'm sure it sucks by now
99%+ completion rate
But I could always get the card game video game on steam and play that instead.
Not so with yugioh
that means..if they got DMCA's for tons of shit, and they hid it, they're completion rate would be a lot lower
hmm
Yugioh is cheap
And that could be what influences my final decision.
their completion rate is still the same
whether they delete something or not
not if they remove stuff from dmca complaints
yes even cause of that
that means they don't have that article for their customers
which means, their server isn't COMPLETE
there server is complete
cause that post doesnt exist on their servers
because it was deleted
As for gaming, I can control myself
I don't need any games right now
their servers are still complete
I have many major games
doesnt matter cause i'm right
semantics
http://www.newzgroups.com/_newsgroup-completion.asp
So, if all the "parts" are available for downloading, then the binary is 100% complete.
yah and all their parts are complete
if they remove a full 5gb post
that isn't complete
so if they remove 500gigs .. all their parts are still complete
that has fuck all to do with being complete
complete means 100% of the fuckn thing
not 80
90
or 73
so not hvaing it all doesnt mean shit
which means, their server isn't complete in their postings
ur an idiot
03btw, I found a thing that proves that the record labels do nothing but steal money from artists
actually that means their server is complete in their postings
03yet proving why I'mn not the least bit bothered to pirate music
because the post in question doesnt exist to begin with
exactly
how does giga not having it make them incomplete?
i guess sometimes logic is tough to instill in people
The only things I'm worried about is other m and skyward sword
Other m is coming in a month and a half so I might have to sell some loose ends in my collection to afford it
... Yeah I must by psyco since I'm talking to myself
Oh yeah
I have about 10 albums I want to purchase
But music is the most pirated digital content available
must be
Cube...
/me throws a cynical bucket of cubes at cube
Cylindrical*
So yeah
Bottom line, I need a job
!rules
guess he felt defeated
so how do we know for sure about this deleting thing?
I dont really weant to swap usenet prioviders if I dont have to
i read it somewhere
hbo stuff has been removed
giga is over priced shit anyway
get newshosting
giga is way over priced
i share newshosting with my buddy .. was $100 for 2 years
newshosting is 14 a month
unlimited ips
they are, but I've been with them for years with no complaints
connections
and 600+ retention
they dont allow unlimited IPs anymore tho :(
who doesnt?
I only have 1 IP =D
newshosting
ya they do
i got 9 ppl using this account
i get max of 3 IPs all the time now
most do dual wan
is newshosting being targeted by the deletions?
years of giganews?
that sucks
ya man
get newshosting
and share the account with a friend
I have 2 internets so, a 2nd IP would be handy
so do i
cable and dsl
do dual wan
i got 3 cables modems
lol
only 60gig cap on the cable here
ouch
dsl unlimited :)
sr get hacked modem
i have one ..
oct unlimited cable coming so i can wait it out
then why do u have a cao?
cap
i get 1Tb a month off the dsl anyways
take forever
got 700+ hours a month no worries
hehe
how fast is ur dsl
5Mbps
omg
id stab myself
wtf
i do
you cant get 1tb with 5mbit, can you?
Yah
it would take 700 hours
yep ..
29 days
lol
I dont see it advertised having multiple IPs on newshosting
1.28 is the max or so
tarawa it wont
lol they dont advertise it
just trust me
it works
newshosting and uns dont block it
yah hey come here so we can lose money
but as of about 2 months ago i get max of 3 IPs on newshosting .. which sucks balls
hah
i use 3 every time i download
and i know atleast 5 others use this account 24/7
oh i know it was like that when we first signed up .. but i swear as of 2 months ago i get that error all the time
u gotta sue euro server
cant exactly email and be like hey why cant i rip off your company anymore :)
now that i never tried
and port 7000
or 8000
lol
pretty sure i use 9000
why cant you email them
ive called comcast and asked why the fuck my hacked modem doesnt work anymore
email them and ask why i cant do someone thats not even allowed to begin with ?

Espeon care to pass me the variables?
mkay
need some help plz
my bro installed 4.3 without me knowing
hi, anyone know why a wii would suddenly stop loading discs and give a black screen and just hang there
how can i install hbc
?
it's broken?
:D
anyone?
You can't. Yet.
Wait for the new Hackmii Installer
ok
You'll need to use smash stack or indiana pwns.
do you know how long that will be?
smash stack?
!wb Smash Stack
Smash Stack: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Smash_Stack
Smash Stack is an exploit from Comex that uses a flaw in the custom stages in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (NTSC) to load unauthorized code on the Wii. It was released on August 20, 2009. It works for all System Menu versions.
!wb Indiana Pwns
Indiana Pwns: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Indiana_Pwns
The Indiana Pwns is a safe way to enable homebrew on a Wii without hardware modification. The Indiana Pwns is achieved by playing a hacked game save for LEGO Indiana Jones which executes a homebrew application from an external SD card. Examples of such homebrew .elf or .dol files can be found on the List of homebrew applications|Homebrew applications page. The Indiana Pwns was created by Team Twiizers.
Smash Stack is NTSC Smash Bros only
Indiana Pwns is PAL/NTSC Indiana Jones
im in uk so i only have ssbb pal
and dont have indiana jone
will it work with the pal version? or has it been confirmed not to work
Zer0900, is your wii chipped or softmodded?
softmod
ultimate softmod 4.1
did you update anything? how are you loading your discs?
just burnin them and putting them into wii
nah, didnt do any updates ever
perhaps the laser burnt out
Zer0900 on power on it still give black screen ?
you need to use a 'loader' to play backups if you're softmodded...unless you installed that shitty cioscorp
there's a possibility someone will make a PAL version, but it is unlikely
hmm
Dami0N, nah, only when i click on the game to launch it, gives a black screen
does anyone know how long it takes for hackmii to release a new installer usually??
usually anywhere between a few days and a few months, depending on how much they have to do
oh right lol, so not really a rough time but oh well
i only got the update cause my bro did it ¬_¬, just as i was gonna reinstall hbc
ah
went to install it got error 4, i was like WTF then saw i was on 4.3E
:(
yea
cioscorp is the worst piece of shit ever...surprised you didn't brick when you installed it
!!!
I just found a complete system backup of my computer before I sent it in for repair stashed in my external hard drive
Which includes...
ah then your softmod is fucked by an upgrade
Well I'm gonna go for now
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I LOST FOREVER
INCLUDING THE WALLPAPER COLLECTION
Thanks for the help, and see you all later =)
no...he's using cioscorp
get rid of that shit and use neogamma...or better yet, get a usb hdd

2hi Arti~
2... so it DID split
like a network where you have to login with your own username and password to be allowed on the network
I have a guest account on it, but it logs in just fine
I don't suppose anyone has seen Lugia have they?
like a university network, company network, etc
personal networks are very unlikely to have it
don't worry, JUST got a text
okay, then no
ok. have you googled the problem?
I got KLined on freenode -___-
4SPLIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
now that's a split...
LOL ive never gotten klined on freenode
could be that they did a too-wide kline
or it could be some server staff being dumb
just connect to a different server
probably the latter
no no
KLines are recursive on freenode
They're like a GLine

well, we use a different model...plus we only have one server
ahh
we have like, 8
:O
/me puts an icepack on the bruises
weve been proposed links before, but we turn them down primarily due to not meshing with our admin model
we as in my staff turn it down too...not just me being an ass xP
in fact, usually on votes i abstain unless theres a tie to break
/me eats the icepacks.
[16.67%] [Up: 13d6h40m7s]
that's not how it works D:
D:
I don't care.
that's my server =P
that and with only 1 server.....we have no need to worry about link failures, people not meshing with our rules, not having power enough on other people's servers etc etc etc
ahh yeah
i dont know if i have that much uptime or not because i rebooted recently
before that, uptime was like...months
Though, I do suppose I could still do it...

i believe you can have hb on 4.3 but im not sure, havent updated since 3.2

12What marks......?
I think I would need to reprint it, if I can over here...
nah
I passed the year with a 3 which should've been at least a 5.5 ona scale of 1 tot 10
I'd rather be inside and watch my TV

For a Windows based system I quite like 7 too
dude
what the fuck
you can't be serious
I have no problem with Linux, just that I'm an A/V nerd and you just can't do decent video editing on it
or games
the ps3 move uses THE ORIGINAL PLAYSTATION 2 EYE ?
or much of anything besides like pro hacking
You need third-party software to do even basic things like checksums, programming, editing anything, or compiling anything.
or is it a ps3 eye
http://us.playstation.com/ps3/accessories/scph-98047.html
what other ps3 games use a ps3 eye
That's the PS3 one.
The PS2 one was the Eyetoy.
ah
how come you can buy the eye seperately
It's been out since the PS3 has.
separately
Eye of Judgement used it.
musta slipped my mind
its gonna fail big time
same with kinect

all I know is it came from Windows 95

/me pokes spawky
or make a 1 handed controller
by then WIIHD will be out
I know some people don't like MIDIs, but that is seriously amazing
cause you can't fucking accel/brake without somethin
how the hell you gonna sell kinect to forza fans

exactly
it's a jazzy remix of ATC - Around the World

which I now have stuck in my head
basically, instruments
/me 6probably knows, but not by name
you what irks me about the whole kinect shit for the 360, is that they can spend millions developing that stupid shit but they cant make a light gun?

you can open it up and make sheet music of it

the only thing I disagree with is that video production should be as high on Windows as OSX >_>
"Bleh, one of the worst experiences of my life was video editing on OS X. Mac advertises that it doesnâ€™t get those â€œcryptic, unintelligible error messagesâ€ that Windows gets â€“ itâ€™s true, it just locks up and doesnâ€™t doâ€¦ anything. " <-- ahaha
I have used OSX to edit video, also, and I find iMovie and FinalCut much more user-friendly than Movie Maker. Of course, I didnâ€™t spend as much time on Movie Maker because it isnâ€™t capable of nearly as much as FunalCut, which I had grown accustomed to. <-- that guy is an idiot
who the frick uses WMM
ever
/me hands people a free pirated copy of Corel Video Studio X3
I had to use some Corel programs for school and hated them
VideoStudio is quite awesome though
they were for image editing, the only reason I wouldn't have preferred paint was because paint didn't have the necessary visual filters and/or vector drawing
LOL
I m ean Corel Video Studio
is pretty awesome
i use WMM
EW
i h8 it
then don't use it
but its all ive got
i wanna just ask what the exact steps to play games from usb
tbh I'd just go looking for some other program rather than take the risk, even if CVS is apparently good
I have yet to use something better
Adobe Premiere is just plain crap, and I never did get the hang of Sony Vegas
and I have already had a crap experience with Corel and would rather not possibly go through it again. 8)
when I start a roject I usually write a quick database class.
/me is new to PHP.
The last Corel product I used was Wordperfect 8 XD
LOL
my mom and sisters love WordPerfect 8
I personally prefer Word 2000

is gears of war 2 on pc
google it FFS
no its not
It's funny, too, because now Epic is saying PC gaming is going to make a comeback.
LOL
pc gaming will neve come back becaise it cost so much
when u can just get said sonsole and said game thats it
Their reasoning was that there's going to be too much time between consoles and PC technology already destroys both consoles. As soon as more people get PC that exceed the abilities of the 360/PS3 console sales will drop.
03!lag
PCs that can handle the graphics are expensive
/me is way toooo hot.
gears of war 2 on the 360 was fun though
Because of the temperature inside the house that is, not due to attractiveness.
Hi.
wheee photoshop code got mailed
Evening, I'd like to run SMG2 (PAL, from disc), I haven't used wii a lot .. I have wiikey and it would like to perform 4.2 update (I have 3.2E). I have homebrew channel & usbloader. What is easiest way to prevent firmware upgrade?
..
crud
wrong room
i know, i spent $500 and the thing would barely run COD WAW
dont go to 4.2
? softmod
paranoidi, http://tinyurl.com/wii3141
wait, don't you need to update every so often though?
because the wiishop won't let you go there sometimes without an update
Ice, sit down before u hurt yourself
if I just use SafeUpdate to go 4.2 will SMG2 stop asking firmware update ("full update" which I assume causes me only troubles)
12Hm
12?
12Whats that?
why are you updating to 4.2 anyway?
are you running it off a disc?
yeah, well, I guess I could run it from USB if I had my 16GB stick here ;P
congrats Roara

rain is epic ^^
rain fails

5Actually, not always. I don't like rain when it rains out a marching band performance/baseball game/football game.
5But it's wonderful when you don't want to go outside and march. 8DD
Shadow: Sorry for the newbie question but I just bought my wii, it's 4.2U with the newer DVD drive (meaning no disc playing on backups :( )

12Nick there were storms here, did you get those?
there isnt
12Thunderstorms I mean
RP4l: you just jinxed it D:
5Ooohhh omigosh I'm so excited. o3o I'm going to Worlds of Fun tomorrow! ^___^
worlds of fun?
12Also yay, I figured out something that makes my Lugia drawings look more like a proper Lugia ;3
no thankfully not
Shit
Guess I'm fucked for GC-playing.
since when did ur lugia drawings NOT look like lugia? xD
5Worlds of Fun is in Kansas City. It's SOOO MUCH FUN. <3
Unless I buy it heh
12Well
5And ditto on what Nick said, Arti, LOL.
your Lugia drawings do look like proper Lugia, Arti o.o
also did you see my finished Lucario pic?
<late>
anyone else for that fact?
12I did yeh XD still need to comment
12and I'm picky with my Lugia pictures, usually if the face isn't perfect, it doesn't look "official" to me
D:
Not my hat.
12and I realised there was something wrong with the eyes in most of my recent pictures which were making it look less Lugia like
RennyC, or waste the money on a Wode
/me gives it back
Wode?
http://www.wodejukebox.com/
/me huuugs back
/me equips her cap.
RP4L: because it is the world of fun? o3o
/me pokes cap
arti they seem fine to me heh
12I have very high standards of Lugias
12XD
5@Brother :: I personally think KC is kinda overrated (but the Chiefs ROCK) but it's a way cool amusement park.
._.
/me growls.
Whoa that sounds cool
12Overall they may look fine but if there is one tiny detail off to me it can ruin the entire Lugia feel XD
6^this
/me defends it.
/me stares :o
5@Arti :: You have very high standards for /yourself/. ;3
/me feasts on the corpse.
D:
/me glomps Arti
/me failed.
12Mostly it's the face and fins to me
6fins are a pain
or ftl
12But I have no trobule with the fins anymore, and think I just corrected all my Lugia face issues
12For good
5"For the loss"? Haha.
12Now to just make sure I get the wings right.
/me wonders what a wuggle is
RennyC, get the wii enhanced version
who is this wuggle :o and where can i get some huggles?
wode = waste of money imo
It is easy to find huggles!
5I don't think any artist is ever 100% pleased with a piece of theirs. It's.. I dunno, creative nature or something. The human strive for perfection.
:o be nice
But wuggle is a creature that can be devoured for noms!
it was a friendly push
noms you say? :o
12Yeh
6I'm not convinced it's perfection
Trying to get his attention
/me remembers the undersea lugia he did :3
>.>
friendly is good :) :p
12Although I'd say I'm about 98% pleased with my Lugia Silver Soul pic XD
6the fact that I know I'll never be perfect means there's limitless ways to explore art
I thought I really got the nice reflections on that pic
/me shoves Proto.
6which keeps me occupied
12Nick, you do the BEST pencil art
/me tumbles down the stairs
/me falling trees Proto!

whys that Wulfgar
4WROOOONG
it would only be good if anybody wanted to play gc games

/me gives proto a band aid
5Where is it, Nick? Now I wanna see.
think whatever you want...I'd rather swap out the wii drive before I waste the money on a wode
6I'd like to make a comment
thanks
for her majesty's secret service only
6the antagonist for BW has a very classy look

12I need to get to bed after this
sorry i just thought somebody would have been testing it by now

12I HATE the chipmunk Pokemon.. or whatever the hell it's supposed to be

6...
5But Giratina will also play a central role in like two fanfics I'm writing LOLYAY.
6hax
cuz they are l33t

4EEEEEEVIIIIIIIL
Electric
Ah, I hoped you would have remembered about how much your score was :3
But okays!
look at the Dex
12You lot are keeping me up

14LOOOL
:o what card game?
hi guys
? list
I'm not even sure that's an accurate time. :P
? softmod
RP4L; but then no plot for easily made profit sequels :P
5Welcome back. ^^
hey and thank you RP4L
5@Brother :: Sure there is! Human resistance against the insane mutant purple kitty.
unless you want to go with "teh world is dead, and we are to lazy to save is so u do it." "Nu u"
but theres always human resistance XD
5My friend made an RP plot like that. The first sentence:
highly advanced machines couldnt beat the human resistance
EXACTLY RP4L MEWTWO TURNED INTO WUSSIE POKEYMAN
5"The first movie never happened, and number 150 is mad as hell."
Okies :o
what will insane mutant creatures (oh noes we get into Fallout O:) be doing then XD
I saw softmod guide 4.2, is that specific guide for Wii's Menu Ver. 4.2U?
heya Nick!
5I KNOW HE WAS BETTER BEFORE HE TURNED INTO A HIPPIE.
YOU NIXIONITE YOU
/me shot
Is it Amarokz?
I am still highly amused by the fact that how many of those creatures I have in my Spore game XD
That's what I used, it worked but it was a bitch since it's poorly written
you all made torch butt leave XD
5There was the opportunity to go beast on Giovanni and Team Rocket but it never came. ;;
EXACTLY RP4L THEREFORE ZOROARK
SHOULD
BE
4EEEVIIIIL!
thats because there must be a very veyr long epic battle
after 200 years
when EVIL RULES THE WORLD
and Nick is prime minister
5Why should Zoroark get that opportunity? It belongs to a legend.
4EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLL
it belongs to RP4L
wait me prime minister?
Yes
5YEAH IT BELONGS TO ME.
then you get assassinated
/me declares war on Zororark then!
5NO.
by AGENT 47
YES
we need some more players!!!
5I DUN WANNA BE ASSASSINATED. ;;
Proto, wanna join?
well I meant nick o3o;
no
/me makes an account
5And who the heck is Agent 47?
It's quick and easy to download.
but sure we can have you assassinated too :D
5I like 42 better.
DDD:
we will use all nukeular weapons against this demonic looking pokeyman and rid the world of its bad haircut!
you are no classic then D:<
5Actually 42 is my favourite number.
he's a SUPER SPECIAL AWSOME lone
*clone
5I like 36, too.
who is a hit man
who kills people
screw 42 :P
47 is higher
5Yay for genetic copies? LOL.
and then he killsall the other clones O:
5D:
5That's horrible.
because they wanted to kill him
well, its better then being hated by Pride :P
he'll eat you
5;;
but he's still epic
so hes the...epic sin? o3o;
?softmod
? softmod
lol i have no idea what i'm doing on this elements game
wait..drf is here
I did not either :o
loanshark, 4.2 is 4.2...
RP4L: do you remember the movie independence day?
I hate 4.2 to hack, such a bitch
vs 4.1 thats really 8.0 :)
haha
just use the guide on the bot
hmmz
Just beware of Amarokz guide, I was able to use it after figuring where he fucked up heh
again...use the guide on the bot
Broken neogamma wad threw me off for a bit
thanks
hello
Hey
You're welcome
Wii is probably the most fun to hack, due to all these IOS's and shit.
wii is simple to softmod
14That movie was epic
v4.2 is kind of a bitch, PSP is easiest. Xbox 1 was the hardest and most nerve racking I've done (using Hotswap method)
NS reviewed it finally reviewed it XD
*NC
yea
hotswap isa bitch
Hotswap is manly as fuck
4.2 isn't any harder than 4.1
yea i cheated i made a usb to xb adpter
I had the Xbox balancing on my PC case with them hooked into each other
lol
on i have done that
oh*
i just cheat now
i made the adapter and dedicated a 256mb thumb stick to it
I had to unlock the HDD by playing music and pausing
yea thats was always the easiet way via hotswap
:o
/me still has 3 xb1's
all runnin xbmc
Alligator clips into the PC chasis also heh
i could never found xbmc
hehe
i have there site
u can always get a OLD ass version from xbins lol
thou its like from 02
and they have 3 2010 builds lol
I heard they stopped working on it recently
i could never get my 500g to work
like 30mins
aww
T3CH XBMC 2010-07-08 SVN rev30442
and unless it locks
It'd be nice if Wii also had a homebrew entertainment system as polished as XBMC was
u cant lol
:Ð· / :Ð— / :3 / :Â³ / Ñ”: / E: / :Ð­ / Ð„: / :Ñ
wiimc is good
yea well wiimc is getting there
nope
wiimc ftw
no secuirty lock = no putting in a xb w/o a chip
if you want media, get a wdtv
haha
dual layer dvds cost me fricken $2.50 a pop
or spend 20$ on a xb1 :)
wdtv for the win
o.o
Shame Wii can't output 720p on video.
nethier can xb1 hah
bad wireless support though
yea
there wifi is poooop
I run Soul Calibur 2 at 720p, looks nice :)
lol
how would i do evilone
better not ruin them..
Too bad it's in 4:3
how would i do? huh
gooooder english
xbox1 can output 480p/720p/1080i
not many games that support abouve 480p tho
yea
8.5gb disc
lot of homebrew can tho
but xmbc wont play mkv
itll do mp4
itll studder but itll do it
xbmc does play mkv.. its just unwatchable
how would i install my 500g in my xb1
yea
its like 4 fps
:)
ramo: u got the eeprom?
i have a tool that makes xb hdd's
lol
if not, it starts fucking up bad when one partition gets beyond 250gb
splits em up and everything :)
xbhdm :)
it splits f at 113gb
I need a program to split my SD card in half into WBFS
wbfs FTL
Wulfgar: what do you recommend doing then
yea i still use wbfs thou on my new hdd i might make it fat32
14:3
o.o
fat32 > * for wii
My friend bought a 1TB hdd and made it completely WBFS lol
yea
thats stupid
Wii is fine with Fat32?
i wouldnt even do that
yea
of course
wii does fat32/ntfs
Nice.
both
thou ntfs is a bitch
ntfs is read only
yea wich is jew
bluray disks are like $10 a pop though
I'm new to the whole HDD loader shit to be honest, I used discs before on my ex-fiance's wii
lol
USB FTW
Her's is an older model that reads them, so I bought my own TODAY

7Hi, Nick.
7How's fic?
its ok I guess
still need to make end to better the previous chapters cos its like the movies
I hate a ending which is weaker than the previous scenes
/me is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 07:08p -( P:Off / L:On )-
7Then you shouldn't've made your previous scenes so strong. O.o
yeah thats the downfall of my fic
i need to make an ending that justifies the previous scenes D:
maybe...4KILL 1Shadow Lugia with a 50 cal rifle?
7If you could change something in those scenes, what would it be?
/me runs flees and hides
12uhh
well nothing really if they were previously strong I dont see why they need to be weaker
7But you seem to be stuck since you need an ending which follows the previous scenes. o3o
12oh lol

12I heard that they are making a C&C 5

i hear it messes up graphics, though
12I know
I hope they dont make RA4 though >.>
the RA series is sad and pathetic
12I know
and extremely racist and sexist in the 3rd instalment
XD
12RA series WAS supposed to connect to the tiberium series
RA one had some sense in that
12but EA bought them before that could happen
IIRC, Kane was involved witht he Soviet Empire in the original Red Alert.

although i remember getting a 64 because i learned how to ride a bike O_O
I had nes/snes
But i fell in love with the 64
no idea how old i was....i just know i learned a lot later than most people
12is it loading this time?
I loved the nes/snes too of course. But N64 was epic to me at 6. Never saw 3d games before that.
12I mean, did it load this time?
6? ok yeah, i was like 12 when it came out i tihnk?
Yeah, it did. Interesting, very interesting.

Im guessing 6. May have been earlier/ later.

Maleficient is easy lol
Riku or Sora?
04Sora
7o3o
Easy lol
7CoM?
04level 25
04yes Quan
oh
that's why
7Ah.
so i used ATD
I was on level 30-something at that time
but the channel still shows
oh wait
7CoM is a hard game.
level 39
it now just says "do an update to use this crap"
CoM is easy
04...
7It's a real-time card game. O_o
/me > Ninja's
04just rub it in my face why don't you
But maybe that's because I leveled up too much
/me shot
After I finished the game
04yeah well, I have no patience
I leveled all my characters up to level 99
yeah well
I have even less patience than you
03Sigh
03I got a BSOD
Oh
:3
/me trips.
You're lucky I messed with deleting the Photo Channel
WHAT'S THE PLAN YO
lol-.-
:o
/me catches
Try using Dop-Mii to uninstall
wait
it shows as uninstalled
lol
do i have to reinstall them both
/me fails
1.0 and 1.1
well i'm doing that now
Sorry..... at least Proto was there
My girlfriend failed me! D:
/me cries.
I'm soooooooo sorry
7...
Did you remove both 1.0 and 1.1 with DOP-Mii? Oh wait, I'm sure you did
hai kaioo
03http://failblog.org/2010/07/14/epic-fail-photos-review-win/ <-- LOL at those comments
7I've been spending too much time on TV Tropes/
i'll try it now
i'm reinstalling them
with dop-mii
then i'll reboot
Actually
and uninstall
7I thought that meant the trope Heroic BSoD. O_o
/me cries and cuddles.
03No
Remove 1.0 with Dop-Mii first
03it means an actual BSoD.
/me eats the cookie at the same time.
/me nods
And then remove 1.1 through the System Menu
:o
is that what you did
Yup
<3
Don't eat
/me ea- cuddles it.
ok gonna try that
D:
arghh what's wrong with my sd card now
good save :3
:o
Apparently I'm not the only with things having to break down on them
HBC won't show stuff unless i pop it out and in
RAGE
D:
PETA would probably kill you
lol
I feel like playing CoM now
I still want that puppy though :P
but I can't
Here, I'll try it myself
Just to make sure it works
kk erasing photo channel 1.1 now
:P
Oh nvm
:P
yay it's gone
sweet
Thought so
... why do i only have 1600 blocks free
I have to wonder how this crotch-gun, this one guy has in this movie, is operated
versus the 2100 on my gf's wii
:3
...lolwtf?
Why are you deleting all of the System Channels?
i only want disc channel + hbc + mii
i don't use anything else
also, I hate peta
Who doesn't?
they're crazy
there was a good line in the penn and teller show bs, about peta
oh wow line rider 2 takes 128 blocks
:O No Shop Channel?
they're talking about an arsonist the ingrid lady, peta's founder calls a fine young man "If you can be a convicted arsonist who has admitted to starting at least seven fires and still be a fine young man, wtF does it take to be a monster?"
i make things
elebits is 109 blocks
A pox on DSL!
man.. how do these people program their saves
"...welcome to slavery." "No thanks, I've already had a wife."
lawl
so sonic make any games
:( I haven't made progress
It was too confusing to even get some code together
Because it looks like it's all in C
watcha mean
printfs
And other functions that I have to bring in
There's so many that it blows my mind away
you were the one who wanted to make a text game right lol
can someone help me find a pattern like whats used in the banner for the check mii out channel?
lol yes
I know how to make a simple one in C++
:P
you can do it in C then
printf is easy to pick up
It seems to be the same as cout
similar
cout would be like
cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
in printf it'd be
printf("Hello, %s!", name);
%s is like a placeholder for string
printf is dumb
lol I went ahead and deleted my Photo Channel
So I guess I can pick up C, then
well go write a sample thing in C++
and i'll do it in C
and then you'll have a direct comparison
do....object oriented programming!
/me was tab failed.
oh wait....... ;(
yes
/me falls out of a hydrogen proton.
Is it a delicious hydrogen proton? :o
No.
That's why I fell out of it.
I hated it.
All right, lemme go to pastie
lol, this was something I wrote up a few days ago out of boredom
let's see
/me puts some sugar on it!
Almost
http://pastie.org/1045035
lol
uh
-.-
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKnGJ3xLsLY
LOL
LOL
LOL
lol not bad?
:P
......
I bet it's horrible
Hahahah
XDDD
lol it's really simple
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpf1CiRuxxw
I know
:P
and i think banner.br also
^ fail
now make something more complicated
lol
i just need a pattern like thats used in the background of the banner
probably because cynder so hawt
i dont get what the namespace is
Cynder wants to take a ride on Spyro's disco stick
o.O
indeed.
the blue/orande squares\
XD.
orange*
std?
that's rather disturbing
it's so you don't have to put
2meh?
std::cout
But still funny
and can just shortcut to cout
I think masterblui made a spyro video to that song a long time ago too
2...hello?
the best part is they didn't mean for it to be funny :P
so if you say using again, it replaces std with something else, or it adds to it?
hello?
hahahah
something else
2Hi!
so if i go
using namespace blah blah
using cout << on it's own won't work anymore
since it'll be like
wtf is cout
you have to specify what namespace you're in
it's similar to java packages
/me winces.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRHCCrSSdk
/me bleeds.
oh ok
D:
yes and no
similar but not exactly
it'sl ike if you don't import a package
o.o
14wtf
you have to go
12huh
03LOL wut
2uh...hi?
yeah, cuz java packages are like includes.....you dont have just 1 and it can just find whatever youre looking for
how did THat happen? Dx
lol what on earth does that have to do with Spyro?
All right, I'm working with something here.
XD
idk she always does pop videos
/me 2is eating marshmellows
I'm going to make use of char
i'm trying to find somewwhere to buy
a USA version of pop'n music
never heard of it
get the channel and rip it apart
?
u will have the banner in the right size
no i'm from canada
what the f-
then edit the banner file
but of course that was last year when using as many effects as you could was all the rage too :P
ahh
Thanks XD
12WTF!?!?
so you know all aboot the maple leaf
I got notice'd too
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop%27n_Music <-- there's a japenese and an EU release
2thankyou
but no USA
/me blinks in surprise
12what was that?
Spam o3o
lol I remember all my haters "u need 2 add mor effects!!!!!"
12i have a feeling this isn't over
has a 4 letter word
12lolwow
/me 2is going to her first anime convention
starts with t
ends with l
lol that was random o3o
12who was that!?
use nus downlaoder to get the files
dont patch as wad
pack*
xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK9pi-XsV0M
2who was what?
12idk?
even though you kicked him from the channel, you didn't kick him from the server -v-
12I noticed when my mIRC was freking out
He was just on #rp
12oh
12i don't have the authority to kick him from the server
14None of us do :\
2w00t it's a party inhere!
12That was one heck of a troll
/me 2dances
12lol
12arti needs to promote more Opers
I remember the video you made about that
12ya I'll say
hahahahah
with all the tons of effects and people were all saying "OMG IT'S AMAZING"
Haha
12brb
12indeed
/me 2likes eating marshmellows and dancing to Nightcore
03yeah, I've poked her about it plenty times XD
12she probably won't listen then
14drf: we'll all have to mention it then
12it's perfectly logical to have a server this big with only 3 opers
she makes the colors and textures look cool and stuff but nothing ever matches and her lipsyncing is terrible
12whe all 3 aren't active enough
it seems like the goal of a lot of videos I see are to cram in as many effects as possible
12*when
a lot less people are like that this year but last year that's all it was haha
12vback
12back*
one of my friends does amaaaazing videos, she's like a little effecty but a little not
Maybe I'm just watching the old ones lol
Woooo, I actually made a program that compiled and ran on the first try!
and does amazing lipsync/dance videos
:D
And everything worked as intended
i do that more and more xP
I don't really search for them
often i have a couple syntax errors and everything else works fine
lol
I just click on the ones that come up under related on yours
curly :O
It died.
hahah
:<
A sad painful death.
Hey Curly
alright, osx is booting now
without a boot cd
yay.
hi Proto ^^
:)
hi curly :)
12that was a good troll, but I've seen better
/me is a corpse now and cannot respond.
but.. bandaids D:
:P I guess I'm getting better
But blood loss. :O
also rawr *still has not slept*
fine then D:
Why would a server need more then one operator-- Oh, and IRC operator. Because a real paid operator for a server is mildly expensive. ("So what is your job?" "I'm a computer operator so... I sit around eating donuts and drinking coffee on company money, watching a computer screen to make sure it doesn't crash. Otherwise yeah... my job is awesome." "And you get paid how much?" "More than you.")
/me gets the gauze and tape
formatted to fat32?
ducttape!
I did formated on both fat16 and fat32, but it won't work.
Fixed!
maybe it just doesnt like your card
/me mends the wounds with duct tape!
I'm wondering if my 1GB microSD compatible to Wii or not.
If there are some.
12how did he do that anyway? looks like a complicated code of some sort
:O
duct tape always helps :)
thats what I just said :P
ah
lol
I'm trying to implement an error for inputting an invalid character cohice
*choice
And I made it loop infinitely
It doesn't look at all complex.
:3
lol
12ist was a script...
12so it would be complex to me lol
Simple FOR/NEXT loop.
Aw, that's cute
12I heard 3 "dings" on my computer every time he posted that message lol
yeah my friend drew it then she gave it to me to recolor
12I feel like I shuld scan my computer for viruses o3o
In each repetation grab a random number between 0 and 16, apply that as the colour value for the letter, continue. Then just post it.
12...
Repeat script ad nauseam (or ad ban.)
recoloring's fun when I'm REALLY bored otherwise I just get frustrated, idk how all those awesome artists have the patience for it
12you melted my brain XD
lol
x)
12I'm not that good with computer stuff like that
Since I carry my mind in my bloodcells.
Anyways.
/me regenerates his blood.
12random number generator
12Oh
12thanks
12then put a color code symbol in front of that random number thing
i hear programming if your irc nick starts with S increases the liklihood that youll suck penis later in life
12was it a script, or the flood thing used on mIRC?
Random number generator with a loop.
12and you have a color made at random
12I see
just kidding xP
Remember the loop. As it decreases code length.
12Right
Why? o.o
12so it was a script
Oh, right.
A script triggered multiple times.
12lolwow
At least you will see yourself as the beautiful person that you are! :o
12sounds like he uses mIRC... I think
Fair trade.
Most standalone clients support scripts.
Doesn't matter if mIRC is used or not.
12oh
I have scripts in my X-Chat. :P
12cool
12I'm just guessing that mIRC is one of the best then since I hear about it a lot
12hang on
12oh
o.o
/me was tab failed.
/me is thinking how to activate the mIRC flood script.
12How do you activate it?
lolwut

sadness
An Urgal
/me runs
D:
draw an owl
:D
indeed
D:
wtf
Why sadness?
Hmm
wtf is an urgal
i google it and i still dont know what it is
Owl sounds like a good idea actually
hoothoot
bf :I
:o
It's a character type out of the book Eragon
What's wrong? D:
D:
I painted an owl in like 7th grade but it sucked :P
aw... you got to paint?
/me is not the biggest fan of Eragon
he was being a butt
:|
Yeah
never watched eragon
what's wrong with Eragon lol
the movie sucks
It's... boring
the book is ok
i dont see blue fusion anything
12Finally!
And I don't really like any of the characters
He's not here right now
I guess finding it boring just depends on your taste of reading
lol
lol oh
Eragon is just annoying and a Gary Stu
gary stu?
Lol
/me shrugs
It makes characters boring when they're like that
it's all different depending on how you take books
that nazi bloods got to shoot down sometihng
I find Harry Potter boring
that's just me
eh
i find books boring
x)
it's not for everyone
/me finds books boring to
........ a really nice pillow though
I read one every now and then though
I find Eragon to be full of cliches as well
He'll be able to have a very nice, relaxing, and comfortable sleep
All alone in his bed
helps me sound somewhat intelligent
lol how shweet
But comfortable
i listen to them on my mp3 player
I find any story to be full of cliches no matter what
Well of course
But Eragon consists almost entirely of them
unless it copies an idea word for word it usually doesn't bother me
which is fine with me
as long as the characters are likable
which they're not
i need to finish what i drew...
:3
Star Wars?
zelda
Dang it
oh drf's back
Ah

the unions that defend the rights of workers |:
...XD
i care not about cnn or foxnetwork

I didn't say that, the one funny guy did
:P
desktop
basically i see morons fighting with morons 24/7
not news
oh
you know I think I found another reason for the GULAG
why would you need a case for it?
the thing is, Glenn Beck is exactly the kind of person my family listens to :V
LOL "Jim jones a communist!"
Absol: tell them this
i've always wondered somethin
My aunt and uncle have like, 3 of his books
He is a white supremacist
Nazi
I have another computer I built in that case
douche bag
He supports openly
if communism is so bad, why does the largest populated country in the world have it
a book by a Nazi book in 1934
that said, the USA was controled by the Kremlin
Pirate; I'd say it(China) is revisionist Socialism
but at least they <censored> care for workers
true
hell, over 24 million workers are benifited and saved by this union
...built IN it..?
there are 250 million ppl livin in the us atm though
so by case you mean like
so
ya not very many
well, its taking time
actually over 300m
anyone home?
oh right
300m now
so ya
24 heh
notice that still 45% of the nation is rural
30 years ago it was 60%
lol idk. i can not/refuse to use mah noggin
Murrrnapples :3

>_<
but, absol
the us will be gone
before it gets much further

Pirate; there's jsut one word for him
Sort of
Douche
sawie

the perfect word for him
not really
we have antenna
and he actually called himself desecive XD
that red case has to be the last component I buy for a while cause I am spending waaay to much money

yesterday was an interesting day apperently
its my specal flavor
go eat it
but lately i've been having to get on in the morning to babysit for my friend heh
? downgrade
"Battle of Taejon", happened
heh
being jobless for 2 years has alot of.. side effects so to speak
i'm living with my friend
12hi
hey glacy
14bye
Mrr
:c
Bai
so in order, to stay off the streets i'm basically living as a live in babysitter
adios
Ah, so you sit your friend's child or?
both of his kids
ones 7months and the other is 2 1/2 years old
heh
that's my "job"
though i'm not paid
i do get to eat, and use his net, and i have a roof over my head
Ah
well thats good at least, my other friend is kinda in the same situation
see why i can't really give a crap about glen beck though
:x
he doesnt have a job though he doesnt have that type of thing
because glenn beck isnt what you're in
hasnt experienced them
pretty much
and is agaisnt anything and everything that supports you getting a job
it's what he needs
an eye opener
>.>
then again
He needs to be shot
i think he's the type
that would live in denile of it
till he died from lack of food
as he's that closed minded
that'd be an amusing site if it was glenn beck
*sight
if only because, he's literally even for that Arizona law
"we dont give a <censored> about you, because god tell us"
well i always wanted to see this

Greetings. I've been here before and have read the rules. I want to say that first. Secondly, I have found at tutorial on "installing homebrew, etc. on 4.3U" and I'd appreciate it if some of you guys could tell me if the tutorial is worth trying. I don't know much about this scene, so I'm guessing that just posting this link will get me banned from this channel. I ask in advance that I not be banned; if something is wrong with th
e link, please tell me what it is.
I'll wait to post the link until somebody says to go ahead. Site is wiihacks.com
right.
Most of the tutorials are pretty risky (if you mess just one thing up, your Wii is likely to be bricked, or at least messed up)
hmm.
may I show you this tutorial?
wii sucks for media...which is why I got a wdtv
Also, some of the methods on the internet contain illegal parts (though there is nothing intrinsically illegal about the process, and it can be done legally)
if you want
http://www.wiihacks.com/general-homebrew-hack-issues/61574-4-3-fix.html
all consoles do
hi shadow clone
360/ps3 isn't bad...but I love being able to play ANY format
it looks to me like you already need to have installed something on your Wii before to do that
360 ps3 is too restrictive too
"4.3 Fix
Requires cIOS to be installed"
yep, all consoles do, i got a mac mini only for xbmc
I think steps ah. I missed that
ofc those also do hd
but thats it
even though it's huge
still clunky
converting and media streamers
yeh :|
gotta run a pc with them
i am truly hoping the next ps3 update will allow samba shares
hate having to stream
what is cIOS. better yet, what does IOS stand for?
almost bought wdtv but may go for the acer revo option with xbmc latest build
besides no proper indexing etc
ia
xbmc ftw, nothing comes close
dependign on how much u wanna spend
i still run xbox1 in all the bedrooms running and booting too xbmc
IOS, nobody knows for sure what it stands for (it's an internal Nintendo thing), but people have guessed things like Input Output System (what I reckon) or Integrated Operating System
alongside the ps3/360/wii (depending on the bedrooms)
i need a modchip for my 3 xboxes
basically, the Wii is quite complicated internally - there are two processors!
www.smdepot.net
very easy
i cant find the game needed
eBay
its just xb1 is big ugly and doesnt do every hd file
splinter cell is my preference
and no hdmi
wdtv ftw
two processors for two different tasks?
one controls all of the standard stuff that was in the gamecube (the "Broadway"), and is what all games run on
i got 3 xboxes from my friend
acer evo + xbmc > wdtv
well i thought it coudl play some 1080i/720 xvid content
wdtv/pch > *
the other controls all the new Wii hardware and the security system - this is what IOS runs on
wulfgar wrong
i got 3 xboxes from my friend 2 with a broken powersupply which i fixed
very strange
so, to talk to the Wii hardware, everything (in theory) has to go through IOS
the preference depends on hwo much u wanna spend
the whole coverflow on xbmc so much better
if u wanna stay cheap wdtv is where its at
you spend roughly the same on acer revo then wdtv
havent' seen wdtv with cfw?
sounds like processor 2 is a very advanced northbridge
latest mac mini + xbmc > acer evo + xbmc > wdtv > nmt (popcorn hour first models)
exactly :)
if u want eevry bell and whistle and nice customizations u would want xbmc htpc
is there a wiki or something about this?
dasefx - they have xbmc on mac mini runnning now ?
yeh
dasefx, if you are talking price, yes
lmao
nice
althoguh would be such a waste of mac mini
now, since when you implement something or fix something in an IOS, there's a possibility of problems occuring with some older software, Nintendo decided to skip the problems with testing all the games entirely, and install each new IOS into a new slot, keeping all the old versions.
way too expensive
the only time when an IOS is updated is in a security update (stopping homebrew)
nah i write some apps for the iphone when i'm not playing or watching tv. all in my living room :)
migth as well build a proper htpc
interesting
haha i'm sounding like a mac fanboy, i'm notttttt
cIOS is basically a hacked IOS with extra features and some security removed installed in one of the high-up slots (I can't remember which is used nowadays)
the wiki to find out about all this is wiibrew.org
okay
is the HBC/wiibrew scene against cIOS?
i have a dune prime myself, but maybe on hindsight u shoudl have gotten somethign else
i*
mostly, as its main use is piracy
WADs are also strictly forbidden, right?
well again, mostly, because it is mainly for piracy
only WADs of pirated content are
but if you have a good reason for using one or the other, they are fine
system titles are fine
!wb NUSD
NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
Galaxy|, so WADs used in that tutorial may be fine?
NUS Downloader, or NUSD, is a PC Utility designed to allow easy access to the resources present on Nintendo's Update Servers. Using this tool, you can download, pack, and decrypt many system titles into WADs ready to install.
^ is one such good example of a proper use for them
hmm, okay
depends on what its installing
cIOSes can be very useful in (for example) media players, for allowing USB2.0 support; whereas WADs can be very useful for updating just parts of your system.
it doesn't say. there are 17 different WADs though lol
anything that makes you install that much crap might not be worth the time or effort
would I need a cIOS to watch DVDs? (one of the things I hope to do eventually)
lol, alright
no actually you don't
you just need DVDX
so long as you are running a System Menu below 4.3 you can use that app
hmm
I can't really use it anyway, unless I install another cIOS thing. They called it a softmod, so I probably can't do that.
hesperaux: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
it enables the DVD Playback features in IOS
the problem is with DVDs is that some newer Wiis block it in hardware
well, not strictly speaking hardware
yep :(
Unfortunately I was a tardbasket and updated to 4.3 lol
drive firmware
DVD drive firmware more like
dasefx, dont hide it
u r one
hesperaux: then you are SOL for the time being
but you can't change that from software as far as we know
I purchased my wii...two years ago?
that should be fine then
do you have a bootmii nand backup you can restore to?
Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
lol
yeah yeah yeah stupid bot
I believe it was mid-2009 when they started blocking it
Galaxy|, nope. =( I have never used homebrew before
eesh yeah
you'll have to wait for a new HackMii Installer
don't worry though one is in the works
:
)
:)
I checked here a few weeks ago
Just checking again to see what has arose in the meantime
dhewg needs to htfu
>_<
In one sense, I hope they obfuscate the hell out of their exploits, but in the other sense, I am impatient! =)
oh they do
it'd be better for everyone if they take their time i suppose
yep
lol, exactly
Nintendo makes me rage... -.-''
but yeah, 2 years ago should be fine for DVDs - they started blocking mid-2009 I think
so that's one good thing
yeah, hopefully
I played all the way through twilight princess (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and that is about it
I have brawl, but I haven't even played it
hesperaux: having an older wii you could probably use formatter
btw, do you have either Super Smash Bros. Brawl (US version) or Lego Indiana Jones (any version)?
its a tool you run from bootmii totally formats the nand and starts over
I have the US version of brawl
Galaxy|, not without bootmii he can't :P
good idea to use bootmii to make a nand backup first
Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
henkpoley, good
i know
lol
lol bot
it's "backup" that triggers it (not for me because I'm an op :P)
haha
he told me he would ages ago
indeed :\
nand backup
Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
lame
Very sensitive around here =|
lol
with good reason hesperaux
yeah
its bad enough Nintendo has labeled us in the same boat as pirates
removing all doubt would only make it worse for us
so many pirates come here and don't read the many messages scattered around the place in big red letters
lol
Well, for one thing, the homebrew project has to hold a reputation to Nintendo as being legitimate
Galaxy|, I understand
Nintendo doesn't give a shit
we are no different to them than pirates
apparently
they hold us in no esteem
we are the enemy
ragetastic
they've made that perfectly clear
4.3's update made that abundantly clear
and yet you updated why?
> _ <
i actually read the update text when I installed it. i think i was probably smoking something
yeah that was retarded of me
i wanted the shop channel is all
that seems to be the common thread
=/
they were smart there
people take the hit for the shop to work
all you have to do is install 2 wads for the system titles
and you're set
i heard about that later lol
the latest shop and its ios
i had homebrew in mind when i bought the wii
i just never did it in fear of the risks, so I knew very little about it
you hosed all your fakesign capable ioses though :(
certain 1337 tools need it
the average user however won't need fakesign capabilities
when i updated, I thought the only thing around was the HBC. I didn't even guess that there would be a modded Shop
there isn't a modded shop
homebrew is _very_ riskless on the Wii when you go the Twiizers way
they just update it with a newer version that can authenticate with the service and they shut out hte old client
Galaxy|, if I get into this, I'll probably try to do anything and everything I can. I like to hack around with my toys
given the state of your wii now it might not be as easy anymore
what with the having patched all the good exploits to roll back ioses
Galaxy|, well, I'm sure they'll come out with a new exploit
I hope they do
nothing public
hesperaux: you could take a drastic cut and use formatter to wipe the nand start over
then use your brawl disk to do a system update to get all the nice versioned fakesign capable ioses
it's possible to run wiibrew through brawl right?
no, of course not. But you can do anything you want from bootmii.
i mean bootmii
yes
hesperaux, yeah, you can install it through brawl
install it or run it?
both
hesperaux, you can run *homebrew* right now through brawl
;o
i knew i could run homebrew
just not install anything
yeah
i didn't know i could *install* bootmii
not now
but later
bootmii is what...a chainloader?
you can install bootmii as boot2
the system menu can't check and remove that
bootmii is a replacement bootloader
its not in the nand fs
Galaxy|, but not right now
hmm
until they get a new exploit in
yep
basically, bootmii shoves IOS out of the way
so you can do whatever the hell you like with the hardware
very useful for Wii Linux
its getting more and more ios like as time passes
Ah, Galaxy|, you are suggesting I wipe the NAND later
you can if you want to
Galaxy|, yeah, but without the security
the only risk for that is shop certs or something to that effect
or the limitations
crediar is learning how to emulate ES
I'll wanna do Wii Linux. I've been using linux for 4 years =)
he's got it down pretty well
is it possible to do a network boot of linux on the wii?
I don't think so
it doesn't have the required software on the client end to do PXE
not AFAIK
the network is tough on the Wii
needs firmware
ok
which needs a filesystem
we can't get network from MINI yet because of firmware, no USB support in MINI etc
its on its way though
I might be able to boot off NFS though once a kernel is loaded, right?
that should be reasonable yeah
hesperaux, If you have an initrd with all the firmware in
that would save a lot of space
I don't see why not
how much internal ROM does the wii have?
though booting off SD or USB would probably be easier
Can I boot from usb hard drives?
yeah
tasty...
that is implemented
though you have to be handy with a hex editor
lol
hex edit the command line option
I could probably figure it out
to point to your HDD
ok
i'd need to keep the drive in the same port then I assume (all the time)
no
as long as you don't have two drives
okay
if you have two, it'll be pretty random which order they are detected in
as the Wii's USB bus is pretty haphazard
lol
although I think it's improved with bootmii
right now, could I run the smash stack exploit in order to run bootmii, then use bootmii to use a formatter? or would that be a distrastrous disaster?
you can't run/install bootmii as it stands, it needs an exploit
okay
but an exploit is guaranteed to come at the same time as the HBC exploit :P
=)
wrapped up in a bundle of obfusicated love
hi
haha
HackMii Installer v0.7
i love that word...obfuscate
yeah
it is a great word
makes me want to obfuscate nintendo
rage
lol
no sense in raging
indeed
the wii is pretty much cracked for life
yeah
why do you say that?
because it is
they can't fix smash stack
they'd need to reissue patched disks
=) and i own that game. \o/
is it any fun to play it by yourself? heh...
this was an easter egg in the first Twilight Hack that actively worked around Nintendo's fixes:
http://hackmii.com/2008/06/twilight-hack-v01beta1/#comment-1610
usually good for rebuilding motivation
lol
It did actually type it out just like the one in Portal does |P
*:P
we do what we must because we can. <---lold
that's great
homebrew comes back and we make a neat hack
it's based on Still Alive from Portal if you didn't realise
lol
yeah i noticed
if comex really wanted to I am sure he could revive BannerBoMB
that is another game I own and have enjoyed
but he's too busy off in iPhone lala land
aww :( iphoney fail...
/me likes android =)
just stay away from the Droid-X and its self destructing boot loader :(
hehe
as a matter of fact, i'm staying away from verizon entirely as soon as I can
what boggles my mind about android is the fact it doesn't make use of GPU accelerated graphics
thinking of buying a used G1, putting the latest android on it, and tasting the beef
that would make it so much more useable :(
yeah =/
perhaps as android matures, it will implement that
that blew my mind to read that
hi
indeed
someone should port android to the Wii
that'd be amazing
;o
OMG
too bad I didn't stay a CS student
lol
CS is a lame major these days anyway
port it to Starlet
btw, what architecture is the CPU in the wii?
easier than porting to Broadway
hesperaux, Broadway is PPC
Galaxy|, yeah, now I'm electrical eng.
power pc? hmm
Starlet (security/IOS) is ARM
arm ;o
720?MHz PowerPC
iirc
android could be ported to that
yeah
i'm not sure how the double processor thing would play out though
that is really weird
729MHz PowerPC
you'd need to make a "reverse IOS"
for screen access
Starlet can't access the screen
lol
!wb Wii Hardware

/me clicks
lol
does the Wii have any headers/pinouts for JTAG or similar?
remember, Starlet = security, Broadway = end-user
hmm
it has GPIO pins
people have soldered stuff to them
like LCD screens
neat
how are you
that'd be pretty neat to see Android ported to it
http://marcansoft.com/uploads/images/starlet_says_hi_2.jpg
the graphics portion would be a pain though
dude, i want to do that
^^ that's using GPIO
so many apple jokes
i need to get over my fears of hurting my little wii
have u all see the ipone4 fanboy video?
Android on the Wii would be amazing
that was a Bootmii experiment
hey you guys :D
!rules
yes
before they managed to get anything running on Broadway
hesperaux: with BootMii as BOOT2 and a NAND backup you should be fine, and yes bot I know the rules dammit..
Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
lol
just type back!up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL7yD-0pqZg
hehe
or something
:P
back!up
yeah, that works

http://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/apple-thinks-of-everything-1655-1277826190-13.jpg
Galaxy|, well i was referring to soldering stuff to the GPIO
if you can figure out the mysteries of getting the hardware to work properly in *nix
then you'd be one important guy here
i just googled GPIO wii, but it brought up wiikey. I do believe that's not allowed, right?
lol
guys can someone help me with installing neogamme permanently on the wii, not launch it from the sd card everytime? (im on 4.1 with hbc )
i've never done hardware programming, or even advanced software programming for that matter
hesperaux, wiikey is a modchip, so no :P
mzaouar_ !rules
dunno why that came up for GPIO
hesperaux, http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/Hollywood_GPIOs
i've done some assembly language though, but have never actually used it on a piece of hardware
Galaxy|, he has
lol
i'll be starting with PIC assembly once I get my bench set up again (just moved a bit ago)
Galaxyl ok ok sorry, but the funny thing is wiibrew is linking to these tools so :/
dono
mzaouar_, that's usually a lot harder
you CAN run from USB if you want
!rules
but running from the Wii itself is usually discouraged - risky and sometimes illegal
hesperaux: more power to you
the Wii development has been a bit stagnant lately
and Nintendo's silence and then emergence with yet another useless update has only made it more baron
hesperaux, hmm, they don't actually tell you where the debug GPIOs actually are
http://wiire.org/Wii/console/motherboard
well, it's usually difficult and dangerous running stuff directly from NAND
you can easily brick your Wii
maybe what I'll do is try hacking my linksys router, then, if I am very successful at that, I can see if there's anything I can do for the wii
ok ok cool
hesperaux: that can easily be done via software lol
Galaxy|, they don't seem to mention GPIO there
i wish I had two wiis
its only changed slightly since 2007
Galaxy|, what can be done with software? (brb)
depending on your router model dd-wrt tomato openwrt etc
mzaouar_, internal storage IS NAND
you can put it on a USB drive easily
just format it as FAT and lay it out the same as an SD card
k k will do thx
mzaouar_, a way of installing channels or other Wii software. We don't usually discuss them here unless there is a good reason to, as they are often used for piracy.
LOL
Galaxy|, oh i already have dd-wrt on it
it fucking prints money lol
ah JTAG is pretty neat I haven't done that to mine but I need to learn how to fix one of my WRT54Gs
hesperaux, ah, nice
it had a bad flash
so it's not accepting any FW and it has stability issues
Galaxy|, that sucks a lot..
my router I think has a serial debug port
its not dead that's the thing it works but its radio resets a lot
you can probably unbrick it with a JTAG
don' think it has much else
lol
Galaxy|, strange
yeah thought so too
dodgy hardware?
My main router is an Un-DD-WRT-able Belkin, but two days ago I bought a Buffalo WHR-G300N v2
and I'm using it as a repeater with DD-WRT
<3 dd-wrt
i set up a repeater for my g/f
it works so well
I'm connected via it now, it's great!#
I might take my older WRT54G and make it into a Kismet Drone
half the pages of the web UI simply won't load
none of them are pages that I need, luckily
but it's rather odd
browser script blocking?
after flashing the firmware again (after a 30-30-30), things were better
check this out: http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/
that's the kinda router I have
hesperaux, perhaps because I was too lazy to reset it :P
lol
you have to do a 30-30-30 when you flash it, before AND after. it's very important
believe me it does affect things
the nvram is a pita
sometimes it wont clear until 2-3 passes of that reset technique
30-30-30 is a reset then?
30 seconds holding reset 30 seconds holding without power 30 seconds holding with power
I'll have to give it a try
I'll try before the next flash
forces a clear of the NVRAM
and remember you don't release the reset button at al during 90 seconds
it seems to work fine as it is other than that problem now
you might see the router go through reset more than once. this is normal
should just build in a switch for that lol
instead of holding the button just flip a switch and wait 90 seconds
that's true
yeah
itd be a lot easier
that button is a pain to get at from the outside
but you need to unplug power too
yep
I don't like the DD-WRT homepage though
i usually use a pen
out-of-date crap :P
some of it is
it said my router wasn't compatible, and I got worried
there are conflicting messages on the site
but after googling, I found that it was
(the person who sold it to me assured me that it is compatible)
the buffalo router?
yeah
wouldn't it be easier anyway to just telnet in and do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvram
or wherever
rather than a 30-30-30
yes
you can do that too
i don't know if that's the method, but you can use tenet
telnet*
my L key is lame
telnet or ssh
telnet is on by default iirc
telnet
ssh works too
yeah
how do I enable ssh then?
system administration or something like that
in the services tab
anyway, this is getting very offtopic now, lol :P
>_> yes
i dont remember what files you need to backup / restore to get a properly functional wii again after using formatter
Galaxy|: It would be a good idea to read the channel rules (just say !rules) if you have not done so already. Specifically, rule 1.
iirc something like the shop certs are needed to use WiiConnect24
I haven't bought anything from the shop ever except free things so it doesn't really affect me
i was going to disable WC24. Isn't that directed?
thus far nintendo hasn't abused their ability to use WC24 to do nefarious things
they could however do so
no code has been found that will be able to
but their EULA says they can
yep
meh its 5 am i need sleep lol

ial
You have to put two equal signs because = is an assignment
i must convert them to wbfs
()_()
So, if you're like "x = 4", then, you're making x equal to 4
i hate this why do i have to ?
this commercial
it's the epitomy of idiocy
what a nice face u have proto
:3
If you're like "x == 4", you're *asking* if x equals to 4
why cant they read iso format ?
odd
ciao

/me can not compute
math is bad
That's not math

wbfs have low prefrance than iso i mean iso loads faster
no
am i right i dont know if i am
juse pick one and use it :)
a .wbfs file is an iso with padding and update removed
ok
just one more thing
how can i burn a doul lyer dvd
just like a normal dvd ?
why burn if you have a usb hdd?
i am just asking
yea, you can burn a dual layer dvd with imgburn
if there is a layer break, make sure you specify it, or open the .dvd file
my sister cant read english well so usb is a hard chosie for her
not really sure what you are tryin to burn
14.
wtf does reading english have to do with usb?
ive never had much luck with dl dvd's and the wii....sometimes they work, sometimes not
/me dies
she is stupid she cant plug the use in hdd
but yea, you dont have to be able to read english to use a usb loader, its just pictures and crap
damn do i have to say this
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGame
i cant give her my hdd
you just lost it
YAY!
/me hides
most dual layer games have a specific layer break
when i want to burn a dvd i open the iso with imbburn then just click burn
usually a dual layer iso comes with a .iso, and a .dvd file
the .dvd file specifies the layer break
iso dont ?
so, if there is a .dvd file (which there should be), make sure you open that file with imgburn, not the .iso file
but if there is no layer break, then great
oh i dont have the dvd file
i downloaded the iso for nothing :S
nah, just burn the iso then, wulfgar said there isnt always a layer break
what game is it
samurai 3
yea dunno about that one...if there wasnt a .dvd, then just burn the .iso i guess
should work
the size is nearly 7gb
yea, you need a dual layer dvd to burn it
ok i will try it in my hdd first
yea, if you have an hdd, just use that, will save you the hassle
sure
Heya pplz O:
6go post
6and what crazy person is doing math work at 10 at night in july?
lol I've been doing math for a while now, but I got lazy and forgot to do it when I actually got the papers xAx

howdy
Hey, I thought about using WiiScu to update (mainly) my ShopChannel
Or should I maybe just update everything
03hi
10Hi Quil
hi
update the shop channel should automatically install the ios it needs
Okey, thanks
6wow
6I want
? list
? softmod
And Roara I knew you could want that
/me yawns
thank you :o
Welcome :D
i had a weird dream!!!
well, that's good then
lol
:O
I think the preferred way is with DopMii
(I might be wrong though)
lol you were there
except you were you x)
heh
were not**
lol it was really weird
everyone we talked to yesterday was there
i think
lol x) it was so weird. it was like a game inside of a game.
:D
ohai =P
? list
? softmod
lol just when it started getting interesting someone was calling my phone so i woke up
If I buy a new black Wii in store today, will it be running version 4.2?
it's aight I guess
possibly
x] were you the one watching star trek?
still
it definately won't play dvd-r
Arch > *
yes
what? You're not thrilled at being able to optimise for your CPU?
what's WRONG with you?
no?
xD then i blame you!
lolwut
hrm
:D
I compile kernels all the time
no... usb > * anyhow
what if i get the old model?
lol it had a star trek theme to it
the one that's going for $150 now
just get a wii and usb hdd
like, if I'm bored, I compile a kernel
um
not just kernels
except we were like...the characters of chrystal chronicles x)
everything
ooo and i think sonic
that's like the only thing you can optimize for your CPU
/me is all sleepy D:
x)
i have a USB HDD... can the Wii mods read extended partitions?
WRONG
03.o
RIGHT
<.<
no
-O2 -march=core2 -msse4_1 makes all the difference when compiling *ANY* program
hi >.>
k, i'd have to reformat it then i guess :)
sonic :D
(that's for my particular processor)
yes
mmm, may start using gentoo again]
lol
what the hell, that'll be my project for today
lol i cant explain it w/ out sounding really weird
but damn
I have no partition to install it on
/me keeps losing conciousness <.<
so what you're saying is, current editions of the Wii require a hardware mod if I wanted to play from DVD+/-r?
mmmm
I need to install gparted on a USB disk
For CPU-intensive tasks like audio/video encoding, etc., it really does make one hell of a difference
wake up
I need to find my flash drive, brb
new wiis will not read dvd-r... even with a hardmod
i dont need no fancy processor for no word processing son
but YEAH
it was weird
silly question but... you're not making distinguishment between dvd-r and dvd+r right?
the documentation is ugly
wii uses dvd-r
I'll try to get some rest.
there was an alternate universe :OOO
:O
hey, you cant sleep yet.
03bbl
Why not? :o
14hi and k
i'm not done w/ the story!
:O
alright so it won't read any non-pressed DVD media period?
ahemz
I'll read it later :o
duh
07o3o
nooo just 4 seconds lol
ha
all i remember is something about 3 of yall
i dont remember who
the documentation is easy
lol
forgive my apparent ignorance, but, despite years in the emulation scene, I never actually modded a console
came back to where ever the heck we were acting funny
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml
heh
<o< and so
i tried gentoo once, but it failed miserably
^^ for 32-bit
although, this was like a decade or so ago
(you can't really count DreamCast)
emulation != console
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml
^^ for 64-bit
indeed, but those interested in one field often share interest in the other :)
figured something out and i dont remember the rest :o
lol x)
anyway, thank you for the information today
i remember somone asked if they have played some kind of game befor
e
mine has been compiling KDE for the past few hours, anyway :P
can't wait to try it
I'll need to configure X first though...
ewwwwwww
http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/RTFM.JPG (not related to any conversation here, just found it)
i've got no problem with using my USB HDD... i'm just a bit concerned about spending the money on the console/hardware and finding out i bought an unmoddable version or somehow bricking it
then i remember something about shadow land and zero wrath
KDE sucks balllz
<_<
hi dark truth
NO KDE IS AWESOME
all current wiis are softmoddable
both are nice
and
just the new (black) wii can't read backups
then my weird dream changed do something
really weird.
hey everyone
ZOMG I CAN MAKE MAH DEKSTOP SPIINZX CUBEZ!!111 AND LOOK AT HOW THIS IS ALL SHINEY....ZOMG THERES FISHSTIX IN THAR
and some guy
and if you can READ and FOLLOW directions, the softmod guides here are pretty fool proof
this is an interesting dream so far xD
eww guys :X
was spazing out
black and white right?
all I need is a quick tiling WM
and uber happy
which is awesome
that he was sleepinig w/ me o.o
literally....awesomewm =P
not like sex
the d3-2 chipset can't read backups
might switch to stumpwm though
lol
read & follow; that i can do :)
but actually sleeping lol
I don't use compiz really
We're not all bad :<
what's tiling?
what about bleed and wallow?
I use KDE because KDE apps > other apps
in the context of window managers
the end.
lol
obviously not...I said 'black' wii and you mention the white one
still, are you using all of those school shit and all of that other useless shit?
I hate plasma with a passion, but it doesn't stop me using KDE
uh yeah, because the new edition (chipset) is obviously in both colors
no?
Wulfgar don't take shit from nobody, he smacks his wife around
urgh, plasma <_<
yeah
I DON'T WANT PLASMOIDZ
everything is always black/white with you people
plasma IS a bug
dunedude, no I don't
?
that needs to be fixed
i'm hardly providing shit :)
Im about to softmod my first Wii, can someone tell me the safest place to get the files? I dont trust the people on YouTube..
she, he don't take shit from nobody
the new chipset was released in late aug last year
what's plasma?
Ex0du5, type ? softmod and follow the appropriate guide
that's all you got jinx, is shit
ohh
Thank you
? softmod
plasma is a bit like explorer.exe in windows, only with fewer jobs
Should I update before modding? Ive heard mixed opinions on that..
emacs has it's own way of stacking and tiling tho =P but it is nice how I can have emacs and blender up and running really easily
dunedude: ?
NO
I have no filemanager except for a terminal =P
NEVER do an N update
it controls taskbar (panel), desktop, and start menu (launcher, or whatever they're calling it nowadays). That's all.
get yourself to 4.1 and stay there, use safe updaters
oh
why does it need to die?
Safe updaters?
Oh ok, thanks
Ex0du5, just FOLLOW THE GUIDE
is it like nautilus except crashier?
I like JUST a terminal
/me sighs.
Proto: do you have a facebook?
it looks fine for me even when I'm using my second monitor at 1024x768
nope
oh
why? :o
i really don't know what's wrong with just having a civil conversation
Just don't
/me <3 awesome
nothing
mkay
just don't be surprised, this is IRC
where is a boy?
or multiple regular monitors if you can't afford the fucking variety
Jinx_Dojo, I provided the info you requested... repeating/rephrasing your questions won't change my answers
lol, youll find you cant really try to educate yourself in here with general questions.
This troper aliases the man command (which displays manual pages) to rtfm in all his Unix shell profiles.
lol
which boy? lol
lol
sure, I bet you could find a 1024x768 LCD for practically nothing
where
guy wants to have a dialogue about wii hacking, lol
lol
also, Gentoo is awesome because of this quote:
LO_KEY: thank you for that advice :)
each keystroke costs on calorie, and people don't like getting skinny
is where a boy
"Do not be afraid of the developers who are assigned to (your) bugs -- they generally don't eat people." <-- Gentoo Handbook
wat
lol nvm
yes I did
oh
oh
haha
are you a boy?
but yes, you did provide me with information. I don't see how i rephrased any question--but that's your issue, not mine
Are you a girl?
yes
[124129] what if i get the old model?
07o3o
nice
and did I not say that the 'new' wiis can't read backups?
:q
hehe, dude is getting snippy
it isn't a tv though, so i found an rca -> vga converter for free
I am male though.
o_O
And I don't own any dresses :p
basically, when I'm not using it for any of those (ie most of the time), I use it as a second monitor
good
ohkaaay
lool
Although i wish I did D:
Skirts are so comfy.
Don't ask how I know that >.>
saying "black cats have fleas" doesn't give me any idea as to whether or not "orange cats have fleas"
right now it's just on my desk acting as a display for my wii
Jinx_Dojo: if you get an old model then you can utilize both dvdr backups (+ and -) as well as usb loading.
/me wasnt going to
yea neither was I :P
i have 2 + laptop displays on my desk right now
your cat plays wii?
It was just for the last day of school, when all of the guys and girsl swirched uniforms :p
lol
Nothing weird
haha
nothing weird my bum
? softmod
man I hope ebay ups bing cashback once more before its all over
/now/
O_o?
but right now, I don't even have X started
ahh
I'm in tty1
xD
thats funny as hell
emacs erc, irssi, or weechat?
when I need something light, I use openbox
lol
none of those
what then? =P
xchat in kwin on my netbook :P
ooh =P
hence the Ntbk
:p
btw
emacs is awesome
/me got to wear a nice skirt that day :D
um, no, awesome is a window manager; emacs is an operating system
:P
proto is a male
mhmm

proto is a boy
yesh :3
emacs is fucking awesome
emacs > *

I think it was that that makes grave of the fireflies look like... something not sad.
/me can't come up with a good analogy
Never seen either of them
6heh, I have a doodle of that same thing somewhere
6I thought it was funny seeing "Lugia is rolling around in the grass"
Grave of the Fireflies is ;-;

I am not a big fan of pink
but it was a decent photo
reminds me of the old gag: "What do you give a seasick dinosaur?" "Space - LOTS of free space!"
i'm not a big fan of pink either
but i still wear it
yea lol
rarely :p
I'm not a big fan of bright colors
Im following the guide and I ran into a problem.. I put all the required files on the root of my SD card but the Wii doesnt show anything or do anything when I open the SD card. Any suggestions??
I'm not a big fan of Proto
eh
how big is your sd?
hmmm
bright colorz
256
idk..lol
where, gonna have to do a lot more than that to bug me :P
get a 2gb sd and format to fat32

i think where is....
/me kills Proto

After modding, can you run backups from an external hdd on ALL Wii version/models ??
yes

you'll get more and more cooled down once you see how other pages/forums/companies handle things

hmm impressive
Stupid noob with one post gets his second claiming my spot

lol
file -s /dev/sdc1
only way to settle it
lol
let's say: Seven years? I'm not entirely sure, but it's quite old and surpassed a few changes, relocatings and a domain change
I even spelled like crap to get it in intime
atleast the site address is easy to remember
I am so impatient, I want my new CPU and case to get here already :X
/dev/sdc1: x86 boot sector, mkdosfs boot message display, code offset 0x58, OEM-ID " mkdosfs", sectors/cluster 8, Media descriptor 0xf8, heads 248, sectors 1349632 (volumes > 32 MB) , FAT (32 bit), sectors/FAT 1320, serial number 0x6bab62b7, label: " "
/me steals the mailtruck with them
/me drops them off today
it's always been the same domain name, just the top-level-domain changed in fact :P
I ordered the CPU from tigerdirect cause they had it as a OEM version
so I saved $60
nice
no...
but I ordered it sunday D:
it used to be articuno.co.uk and lugia.co.uk
I still lean towards AMD simply for power vs price
yea I love AMD
but I currently have intel stuff so I am sticking with it
3.6ghz, like 1.5gb video card, 16gb ram for <$2200
yeah
I got a intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 for $139
both would redirect to the same site tho ?
/me pant pant
lol
yes
My friend got a Q6600(?) for $1
lol
yea that was funny
i'll cook in a min maybe
with a mobo and 8gb ram, yay junkyards
he got it working, ordered a 550W psu the other day
1,000 post where?
who throws away something like that ?
people are so stupid
lol
but no it hasn't always been the same domain name
because it was never .us
nice i see you have a redirect for both of those to the new domain
until a couple years ago
/me facepalms
h4x0r3d the script to fix it
anyway
yes, yes i am.
no
D:
bbl, rebooting and modifying partitions
o_O
lol yes
for a while we didn't even HAVE the .co.uk due to LegacyLugia :P
/me eats people they are tasty :3
that person was stupid D:
x) i dont know what tht stuff is up there ^^^
Articuno got them back, but that's not the point, the domain name changed
nor have i heard of it
o.O
nom nom >_>
/me double takes
-> [...]relocatings and a domain change <- what I just wrote
/me sees the word eat :o
.uk is the tld
.co is not part
nonsense
.co.uk is the tld - you get both in combination
i havnt had my daily dose of fruit roll-ups yet
o_o
I have had a ham sandwich today
yeah drf, it's always been lugia
that's all :<
oh great look what i started :P
/me stares at the empty box of fruit roll-ups
eh
if you wanna get technical
lugia.us versus lugia.co.uk
I had some of myself
>_<
I consider lugia.us and lugia.co.uk two different domain names
/me sighs and gets himself a soda
o_O
as I said - only the tld changed
6lugia.co.uk is the site I originally joined at
you had some of yourself
bite a finger trying to eat a sandwich D:
6I was never active though
lol
/me stares at that sentence
if they're the same domain name?
interesting
most people look at domain names as the entire URL, not just the part before the period
yea that could be taken wrong in some ways
because they're three different tld?
if your that perverted
you're paying the the tld
you don't pay for a TLD though
heh
lol uh huh
wtf
i mean o.o what?
See, I only thought about you biting yourself
<.< >.>
yea
<___< heh
I meant like my body consuming itself cause I have not eaten :P
well aren't you one to get technical on me
err i'll be back when the domain arguement is over :P
XD
bye iscooking :O
anyway, brb, gotta grab my ubuntu flash drive out of the car
will you show me your master of computer sciences then please?
I HAVE one, where's YOURS?
:O wow you do ?
if you can't, then stfu

:O
how much was it to get your site listed in the google results ?
10between*
i'm atheist
i've been trying to get my site listed for awhile
iscooking, cool
the one I pasted
:X
it needs to be popular to appear in google
oh
nothing else
:) i should show this to my gma lol
fine then :<

k back

lol at that too Proto
/me likes 4
6with a good few thousand members, we're a rather popular site lol
grr
stupid gparted
anyway, whether we're talking domain names or TLDs
it was never originally lugia.co.uk
wouldn't boot :|
it was always articuno.co.uk back when I joined
LMAO
and it was called The Iceberg of Articuno
that's so hawt
WELL DUH
I remember being mad when the name changed
real hackers use a hex editor to partition their drive
there was probably a reason for that check :P
/me sprints downstairz para more bacon!!
can't you do a way back machine search on all this
http://www.lugia.us/site-history.htm
try it
to make it explicit, the second-level domain was always (if we ignore drf) "lugia", and only the top level domain has changed
nah, it was a faulty check
soo uhh
lol
it's partitioned wrong
right now it's only /dev/sdc, no sdc1
well, the third level has been dropped, but I don't know if most people would actually count www.
how do I fix that mother fucker?
i got threatened to be stabbed by a bent fork
August 2004 - The Iceberg of Articuno emerges as a simple html and php website. <-- that's about when I joine
d
6I haven't used www in forever
D:
And I remember Articuno making a big deal out of buying the lugia.co.uk domain name
/me protects iscooking
so I know for a fact it was not always that
Use parted?
lol
cx nummeh baco
idk how to use parted
bacon**
I haven't even typed it in forever
/me runs
Also, some memory sticks DON'T have partition tables, they just put the fs on the normalness
I just type l and hit tab a few times in Firefox
thank you oh great protector
and history does the rest
:3
Others still do.
Some motherboards will only boot off those with partition tables, others won't.
?
o.O
well
it did have a partition table
/me remembered there is chocolate ice cweam in the fridge
:O
<.< >.>
/me sprints downstairz x3
dd it with null bytes, then use the KDE partiton editor
owaityoudontuseKDEhaha
anyways a wayback search turns up nothing
other than a data retrieval error
6I remember having a discussion about the old TST names
We're sorry. We were unable to retrieve the requested data. We may be experiencing technical difficulties and suggest that you try again later.
yeah
6seems this is a recurring topic
I was really mad that it changed to The Sky Temple, it seemed like such a stupid name
07o3o
but now I'm used to it LOL

Reshiram, LOL fail
I want to bloody edit files
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
6how is that fail?
so hmm
here's what you do
take the plug where the AC plugs in
get a really long extension cord
run it over to the neighbor's house
:)
what about a shell? what about slime inspection? what about an IRC client?

I don't want to play tetris in vim or flip bytes
OK fine, go buy a fan
and do that
I want to bloody edit files
hehe
6we're not going to buy another AC just so we have an external
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK
it's okay
OW MY EYES
you wldnt want my germs
6we have a fan
@ that yellow
what about a shell? what about slime inspection? what about an IRC
	 client?
14xD
Yes, it's all my fault
6lol
fans are over rated
the entire country
because of me.
/me runs
I don't want to play tetris in vim or flip bytes or use a shell (apart from the : command) or inspect slime OR GO ON IRC
I want to bloody edit files
I actually don't do that

/me trips drf
my parents aren't poor, so yeah
heck
all dooone
lol
generally we're the one letting people mooch
I can use a shell in nano
when the power goes out
:P
as we have a generator
6its fun when the power goes out in our neighborhood
slime inspection is fucking awesome
so articuno is her handle on the irc as well ?
6we don't have generators, so we have to make do without stuff
We're like the only ones with power
you highlight a function, and takes you to the definition
funny, I've seen a blackout once. It was in 1995 I think
that's stupid
6we all go to the neighbor's pool
no electricity is fail
No IRC = :(
/me runs
Wow
the thing is
I have a memory for that
we usually have the power go out for like a week
in the middle of winter
6I've been in several blackouts
no heat = FFS
so we eventually just bought a 16kW generator
to power most of the house off of
runs on natural gase
-e
6we've never had blackouts in winter, always summer
one blackout in 30 years, lasting 15 minutes. So what? :)
we have all the computers, TVs etc
6our area has rolling blackouts for the summer heat
Reshiram, what would make the power go out for the summer?
*in
6AC
It always goes out due to snowstorms here
....
6everyone in the state using it
meh
usually the power goes out when stuff falls on power lines
6power shortage
not overuse LOL
most IDEs do that anyway
07lol
so what theme did everyone choose i think i like shadow lugia the best
so if it's like a blizzard out
I use the original theme
or library functions?
6we haven't had one in a couple years, but I remember the news reports warnign us of rolling outages because of a power shortage
tho deep ocean lugia looks kinda cool
WHAT ABOUT EDITTING FILES
what about a fucking package manager for libraries?
I WANT TO EDIT MY FILES
may I recommend putting photovoltaic cells onto the roofs of your houses to power the ACs with them? ;)
WHY CAN'T I EDIT FILES
6I'm on random theme
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
in emacs you can edit files too
Zapdos just hurts my eyes
ARGH FEATURE CREEP
6My family can't afford it here
well either way
we usually have power outages in the winter
and the people who work for the power plant are retards
so it takes them like a week to fix it
6but if we wind up putting a pool in, we'll be having solar panels for it
so we just said F it and bought a generator
fun... <.<
the thing I wonder
how come no matter how bad the weather is
the natural gas never goes out? LOL
as that's what runs the generator
i feel bad for people on solar power in the winter
solar or photovoltaic?
why don't they just put the power lines right next tot he gas lines >_>
07how can you not afford solar panels, but you can if you're going to also get a pool?
lol
affording, lame
go steal some
/me runs
you know there's a difference between both? :)
i take it color is allowed here in the IRC i ask because it's different everywhere i go
6because my stepmom's company just got bought by visa
LOL Visa
can you get me free credit cards?
/me hides
6so we have a sudden large sum of money
6and blablablah parent talk
speaking of which
time to go scam trialPay
6so kyu, I have no idea
6:)
and drf - even if you have a credit card, you have to pay back what you buy with it :)
you know what TrialPay is?
yes
I HAVE a credit card
it's actually a debit card
6ugh credit cards
Visa Debit
ok
so much better than actual credit cards
6I have credit and debit
as I can't go in debt
but it works as a credit card
so it's win-win
what I do
is sign up for like, a free trial of Netflix
then cancel the trial
right
get the idea?
so I get toatlly free stuff
*ttoally
*TOTALLY
nice
that's how I got that mIRC key for TST users
and I need to get an Ad Muncher key for my sisters
and the guys are happy having your data :)
i just use a program that makes the trial go forever

TrialPay does not steal data
nor does Netflix
I'm not some paranoid
i got a free movie ticket from trialpay it was cool
http://pastebin.com/dpKUfNS7
they didn't even know the difference between Windows XP and Windows 7
but yeah
I just did M-x psychoanalyze pinhead
Windows 7 is so much better than XP
and that's the session I had with it =P
I was like "You don't notice it looks different?"
"Oh, that?"
...and they registered which movie you visited and possibly even which snacks and which size and flavour you picked
well
7 is XP as Vista is to ME
I have no problem with XP'
I'm using it right now
but for computers that can run 7
then it's ncie
plenty of data worth ten times more than the value of the ticket :)
ME was a huge fail
ever heard of the Better Business Bureau (sp)?
can you keep going for the same trial drf ?
or does trialpay track it some how ?
oooh
for what, Netflix?
no
that might be why it didn't boot
I never even use it
I just sign up and cancel
I don't have syslinux installed
what happens when you run out of offers
then you're screwed
drf - not a single company has money to give out for free
or you go get another credit card number :)
that's just not true
the way TrialPay works
1. ads
2. you buy something, they get part of the revenue
and in turn they give you something free
I just abuse it when they let you use free trials of services
yeah =D
why sell if you can use the data yourself for market studies?
?
what do you mean
they don't spam me...
why spam you?
not to mention I use fake data anyway :P
I make up a name and address
and use a temporary email'
that I delete once I'm done
I fail to see your point
...and they have your IP and know you're not telling the truth
look up my IP right now
tell me what you saee
*see
it won't be my name ;)
I doubt you're sitting in detroit by now :)
07because they totally check every single person for any sign of suspicion
yeah :P
wait, what?
no I'm not in Detroit
and yeah, that
they really don't care
just not atm, because I need MSVC#
oh do they?
07well
TrialPay is actually an acredited company
BECAUSE SHARPDEVELOP ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH <_<
it's not like www.thissiteisnotascam.com
which, btw, is not a scam
/me runs
6he brings this kind of stuff up every time you mention something of the sort
/me runs
if you ever succeed reaching my age, we'll maybe continue talking about it, k?
6...
...what are you implying
are you saying I'm gonna die in the next 10 years?
did I say that?
then what did you mean by that
now, who's paranoid here, eh? ;)
6what else COULD you mean by that?
Or, he could be saying you'll age faster than the normal population and manage to catch him up
07he's implying that because he's older he can assume he knows everything about a company he hasn't even used =P
experience Kyu
just because you hate our country doesn't mean you know everything
experience in business of a headhunter. Something I worked for about 5 years
6if you ever succeed reaching my age....that's rather obvious what you;'re saying
Not all businesses are evil
Are you also saying sites like Amazon.com are going to use your for market studies?
07lol drf
you have no idea how much
07bad example
07because they do
LOL
6lol
do they?
they don't sell your info, at least
07DUUUUUUUUUH
software
they have an entire datacenter just analyzing what article you look at, how long, what area of the page you're looking, which links you click in which order, which buttons you miss and what you order in how many clicks and what combinations on what days and what times of the day
there's a huge list somewhere
and PLENTY of other factors
yeah but who cares
Google does the same thing
does that mean you're gonna boycott searching?
? list
the Data Mining toolkits of pages like Amazon were one of my computer sciences study topics
for that matter
iTunes does the same thing
more proof that Apple is evil :)
look at how old Amazon is and how old iTunes is
LOLtiming
actually to my knowledge google just looks at the content of what you click on then suggests you stuff
well, partly
14LOL
and they definitely keep stored data to an absolute minimum
not anymore
07it's not like personal data of purchases even matters to the average person anyways, all that data collection is just to try to get them to buy more stuff
because the government is like, making them spy on people
Kyu, yeah

and I just told Amazon not to bug me
besides receipts
14Epicness music right there
Google was quite simple - it searches for keywords in relation linking to specific pages. If a page mentions this keyword close or within a link to another page, this linked page is noted as a possible result for this word
07the only personal info that matters is for things like passwords
the more possible results this page gets for a single word, the more likely is the match
that's how Google works - essentially
? releases
!releases
6that's common sense >_>
and wanna bet Kyu?
!openingwii
I still don't see how this has anything to do with how credible TrialPay is
6lol I was just thinking that
LOL
Advertisements, pssh
who even sees ads?
real pros use an ad blocker
I do, but that's not the point
google just apply their search engine formula to the contents to give you suggestions
so no-one sees your email with them
it has unlimited storage, for one
unlike gmail
you mean
"unlimited"
...which I also don't used
so what mail service do you use
07if I buy something online and get a whole bunch of ads targeted at what they assume I like, then how harmful is it to anyone?
try uploading a 500 GB HDD backup and see what they say
I mean, I have one throguh my ISP as well'
6some german site I bet
/me 6runs
!news
10MB max for attachments
AFAIK
but I have like 4000 emails
and it's not a problem
so split it into 10MB partial .rars
I have my own mail server and my IBM inbox for the rest?
LOL
I'm far too lazy for that
how about this, you email ME a bunch of partial rars
:P
also gmail allow 25 MB, and the 7GB I have is more than enough
why should I?
grrr
I need the command "mcopy"
The thing I don't like about gmail
is they try to be MS Outlook in a web browser
I actually like just plain simple looking webmail
and gmail isn't simple?
6I use gmail, it's simple to me, but meh
it looks like Outlook, doesn't it?
it's certainly no more like MS Outlook than any other email client
6yeah
and hi
It's in mtools
/me hugs back
^^
http://imgur.com/bOZ47.png
yes that TOTALLY looks like Outlook, don't you agree?
/me hides
6I'm amazed he hasn't gotten on your case for that
looks as much like it as gmail does, yes.
6he's done it for everyone else
I'm amazed I haven't banned her yet :)
lol
*?
Screenshot it then
I did it for those forgetting to capitalize the S whilst the T was correctly
because I haven't seen that
6drf, that looks a lot like gmail
6a LOT
LOOL
lol
hey, Cube did his job for him
07lol
and drf, you're just made of fail. Would you please grow up? ;)
6pfth, proper name should be capitalized
6look who's talking
lol
07lol
6didn't you do the same with the !define script?
wait what?
07I know I did :D
/me runs
OK WTF
WHy am I unable to format this hard drive
I'm running Linux off a flash drive
2back
trying to make an NTFS partition
and it doesn't work
it just errors
o.o
2hi Zu-
http://www.arthi.org/ui/gmail/gmail_inbox.jpg <-- one someone else uploaded, I don't see how that's any closer to MS Outlook other than having thinner borders
2O__o
/me 2flails in the bukkit
lol
Because
when you click on an email
it opens below the list,r ight?
not in its own window?
6its own window
...
my friends must have theirs set up differently then
it opens in the section that was the list
2o-o
6not a new window, but the page changes from the list to the email itself
hm
well either way
I haven't really liked gmail's GUI
/me 2flails more in the bukkit
I tried it back when it was invite on;y
and it was kinda annoying
*only
6LOL invite
and yeah
6I joined at that time too
more explicitly the large iframe changes from the list to the email
2it CAN open in a new window
guess who invited me
6I still have 50 invites cuz it changed right after I joined
a guy from my ISP
/me runs
2thankee~
likle
*like
I called him
^^
said my ISP email wasn't working
2lol Reshiram
he was like hmm, try gmail?
I was like, I don't have it
he was like OK, I'll invite you
I was like LOL
6lol
I called in to report a problem with my ISP
and the guy gave me gmail
6invite was the stupidest thing ever
what new pokemon game are you gonna get black or white?
6I mean really >_>
6Black
6for the obvious reason
6<
both
white is so much better than black, serioiusly
i know
and I'm not being racist
/me hides
I have an email based on google but registered with a friend's domain, so I get a decent service and it doesn't look like a free one
i want black
7Whatever is the less favorite. o3o
6I woulda gotten white, until I leanred reshiram is in black
6learned
/me runs
i know
6but I also want zekrom, so ffff :|
then be like me and get both
i dont like zekrom allot
I don't like either
and drf : http://i27.tinypic.com/90djkh.png - that's MY webmail inbox :)
they both look retarded
LOL empty
OK see
I'll show you what I hate as far as webmails go
hm
sure empty. I download what I need ;)
hm
hm
I just leave them
hm
unlimited storage, remember? :P
hm
what do you mean wastes space
where google's is minimal
yeah
in mtools
UI
I'm wasting space by not using it?
you call it a waste, I call it "keep a nice reserve just for the case"
what, you can't search a package by files in arch?
lol
funny that, you can do it in Gentoo and Debian/Ubunti
*Ubuntu
http://imgur.com/xCoCo.png
that's my ISP's webmail
6the pessimist and at optimist
and I absoultely hate it
THAT looks like Outlook
6*the
and I thought gmail worked the same way
and in fact, in Ubuntu it's done automatically if you type in a nonexistant command
at least it does for my friend
6wow....never seen that for gmail
I'm referring to the UI, there's plenty of space that isn't used for something useful and could be very easily
I have
maybe it's an option o.o
still, that's annoying, isn't it? LOL
6one I wont be using
wow, you're getting lots of spam
6yeh
My ISP is like "It's a new fancy webmail"
I get none ;)
and I'm like "I want the old one."
6thats not his email o-o
wait what?
that's not spam
how is reference.com on this day spam
I signed up for it
words of the day FTW
6lol
I never give that email out so I hardly get stuff I don't want
...
I knew you were made of fail. But until now I didn't know of HOW frikkin MUCH FAIL you're made of :P
wtf
6...
you call my preference in mailing lists fail?
6that was....uncalled for
I actually LIKE those
it's cool
it gives me a random fact every day
:P)
-P
also
see where it says "
the one person's fancy thing is the other one's fail
"ADVERTISEMENT"
Look below
do you see any ads?
:P
lol
nope, but I just saw someone being kicked :)
Wow, what an annoying waste of time.
someone once called me stupid for using the Everybody Votes Channel on teh Wii

I'm having to make a 32bit chroot to run unetbootin to put gparted on my usb disk
fucking gay, rite?
and watch /this/ not even work
it never would have happened if you used KDE
:P
atleast he was trying to put things away lol
yeah it would =P
KDE sucks balluz
(I'm recompiling GCC because I installed X then told it to recompile all packages that can take advantage of X, and one of those happens to be GCC for some reason)
that's gay
GCC's fault, not Gentoo's
lol
everything else I tried didn't work
lol
what on earth are you even trying to do?
most live CDs come with a fully functional partitioner
uhhh
OR EVEN JUST THE GPARTED LIVE CD :D
I'm not using a live cd -___-
or that
lol
^
now if it was one of those water bras it would have been really funny
but why?
the blundertails were easy for me
i just used fury
so I can resize partitions on my hard drive
then try out gentoo
anyone know what walmarts return policy is on hard drives?
you can resize partitons in a booted system
just unmount them
http://gparted.sourceforge.net/liveusb.php
!espeon
lol
no she doesn't have a water bra that i know of
The fury cinematics are way to long, but there still cool.
yeah i love the earth fury
but i miss the fireballs in new beginning
i didn't like the comet dash
walmart lets you return ANY damn thing
in ANY condition
yea figured that much
still got the receipt so i should be good
what are the chances a walmart employee even knows what a hard drive is?
can we return crazy used girls?
its about 3 months old. got dropped today
you can still get store credit
and get beer and shotguns
yea thats the main thing, store credit would be fine. then i'll just grab another one
yea theyll do that
theyll do that a year later
it didn't work
sooooo
resulting in unetbootin
perfect. just blows i had the thing loaded up and now its fucked.
/me debates becoming a lesbian..
7DAH.
7I wish you could crop real-life canvases. D:
77MB to go :D
tell them youre gonna need your data back
ah
lol
wait, so why not just boot into a random live CD?
yea that would go over real well :P
pretty much *any* live CD will do
or another partiton
good point
lol
I got it all. its all good
you must have something lying around
lol
mmmm
I don't have anything but arch CDs lying around
I have 4 working systems installed at the moment
well, maybe one or two of them are missing kernels, but other than that... :P
wonder what they do with their returns anyways. try and repair them or toss them?
you can
it's called scissors
/me runs
I hate how they changed ice, and eclectirc into orbs.
all different distros
gcc is compiled!
But you can't resize 'em
toss em
lol
i dont know honestly
recompiling more stuff now
but the other day i went to return 3 diff things
with 3 diff receipts
you can
it's called a Xerox machine

including food

yes
6anyways, they mentioned that Apple is well aware of the dropped calls and everything

12...

I misread that as boob
/me hides
12oVo
12OvO*
12XD
10I suppose you're right Aurora, as rule 13 says: "No bringing up old topics that do not relate to this day and age. You may bring up old topics if they have died out and will be good to start again but if the topic concerns members or situations of the past, then it's quite pointless"
6if it stays dead, I'll lock it I guess
10it relates to this day and age, so.. my mistake
6but as of now, it's still relevant
do we have a rule 43?
/me runs
12LOL
12I think you mean 34
/me runs
um
yes I do
my bad
12XDD oh
10Rules only go up to 39 lol
12lol
so we DO have a 34
12wait
1034 is the script one
12oh
10"No automated welcome back messages. All scripts must be triggered by an exclamation mark, for example !hug or !eat"
I LIKE WB messages ;.;
I still ahte that rule
*hate
it's like the only one I actually have to follow

HI :D
/me meows and huggles Curly.
hola
Hello, peoplethings.
hi :)
afk
04oh no Quilava D:
/me hugs ^^
?
10No one talk now?
04the boss
04D:
you're at it?
04yes
have fun
:D
/me huggles.
04i only have 6 hearts
04and a fairy
04D:
14Not really
o.o
4hey look it's a noob
lol
/me pokes Proto with a syringe.
/me dies
youre not dead :O
/me injects Proto with ADAM.
have you played it?
:D
twas liquid 8424772
/me lives
not EVE? :O
14No and I don't want to
That wouldn't revive him, I don't think. :o
It would not
I still find it funny in Bioshock that the guy just randomly stabs himself with a huge needle he finds
minus one 7
Nor would ADAM, but I needed my Bioshock reference.
a huge glowing needle
EVE would have been a bioshock reference :O
doesnt like zelda something of time
Didn't Atlas totally tell him to? :O
hai~
"Steady now. Your DNA is just being rewritten."
14PMzors?
lol
Sure~ o3o Don't need to ask
14k ^^
/me waits
04damnit
04even with 12 total hearts i couldn't even phase him
yeah
I told you, that thing is insane
I don't remember Atlas telling him to use the needle
he just uses the needle and then Atlas says that
also gigantic plot twist was gigantic :O
/me quickly points out that she never finished the game.
Yet.
D:
me neither
I love that game
Choice between good and evil
I prefer Bioshock 2, tbh.
Never played
I didn't even get bioshock until last year
I want to finish Bioshock so I can play Bioshock 2
You don't have to.
blah
I want to
besides
maybe you're missing some references because you never finished the first one :O
Psh. :p
Possibly. :O
There is a trophy that I had to get that was a reference to the first game.
Afternoon, Lyon
I didn't know about it until after I finished it, though. ._.
7Hi, Lyon.
04hey Quan
/me 7pokes Lyon about AQ.
see? :O
04ohyes?
04i don't even know how to go about killing it
Just one!
/me doesn't play it much anymore
D:
7Lol.
you have to jump into the water and use zora magic shield
hi Quan
AQ as in adventure quest? That game that spawned a near infinite amount of clones?
Besides, that was on the consoles. :P You'd never notice it otherwise.
|3
04lolEspeon
04yes
7Clones, really?
lol great, it spawned all those clones popping up in ads
04Quan
pretty much the same damn game just with new models
04Dragonfable, AQ Worlds, Warpforce, etc
04hey Espeon
7Ahm, not exactly.
hey
7That's like saying D/P/Pt and HG/SS are clones.
well I NEVER played any of them so I call them clones :#
:3*
they look so similar... and well I have tried AQ but found it boring.
6in espeon's terms, DPPt and HGSS are clones
6just saying
7Because they use the same mechanics?
/me looks around.
/me waves
04tbh AQ is really the only one I've stuck with
14gotta brb
I think I'll go play Colonization. D:
04k
/me wanders over to Steam.
14gotta brb all
04k
6pretty much
there's a difference between a company using their own mechanics in a slightly improved/modified form and other companies pretty much creating "x Game! Now with... something new!" and releasing it as the best thing EVAR
hokie
7So... are you criticizing games not made by Artix Entertainment?
04hmm
I just dislike how sooooo many browser games are so damn similar.
They're all just wanting people to buy PREMIUM FEATUREZ anyway.
/me hides
04^
/me 7blinks at dA:
7Who did that? O___o

10probably that
10gotta go
I skipped it and beat the last level before it
04i can do this perfectly
10bowling time:D
04but for some reason
04he keeps shielding with his fin instead of using electric shield when i want him to do electric shield
Hey
you have to be swimming to use shield
04this concept is so easy
04but i just fumble too much on it
that's usually how bosses are
04great

12i have a wiiware version
7Hmm...
03Optimus prime's brother.
To watch a movie or to sleep D:
Decisions, decisions!
both :O
12optimus prime's brother runs mac OS x
12that's why hes the villian
So I would watch a movie and then go to sleep? :o
03LOL
03get this
03my sisters are the biggest noobs ever, right
03like they didn't even know the difference between Windows XP and 7
6bet my grandma is bigger
12crest is the biggest noobs ever
03but they tried using a Mac
03and were like
03WTF?
03so that's proof that Macs are NOT easier to use
12i was going to buy some of their white strips
/me runs
or fall asleep while watching a movie :O
12until i saw the price
6macs aren't easier to use
03well that's what they advertise
I WAS HIGHLIGHTED
WAI
6if they were, I woulda figured it out immediately
D:
03all their TV ads
RAEG
03are like, they're so much easier to use than PCs
03which is pure crap;
6it took me a couple weeks
o.o
03I mean, I can do stuff fairly fine in OSX, I just hate it
03like
03if you have something windowed
03your stupid options
12you can do less with them than windows
03are way at the top
03and I'm lazy
03and don't feel like doing that
12so in a way it is easier to use
03>_>
03...LOL
/me thinks he will just go to sleep! :o
03By that logic, a brick is easier to use than both
No.
D:
Not when I come back. ._.
/me cries.
k D:
12bricks ARE easier to use
No sleep yet then. ._.
:D
12you just throw them
03XD
/me hides
/me huggles back :o
12i heard this criminal tried robbing a jewery store
12by throwing a brick at their window to break his way in
12it was one of those strong windows that is meant to withstand heavy storms, so the brick bounced back and hit him, knocking him out quite effectively until police got there
7o3o
12so i guess some people aren't smart enough to use bricks
03LOL
03still
03my sisters are pretty big noobs but they know how to use iTunes and their email >_>
03and google
03and like, Word
03that's pretty much it
03anything else I need to help them
12i used to be able to use excel
12XD
03Excel is like, eh
03you really don't have a use for it outside of school LOL
03like I'd never use Excel just for fun
03whereas I use Word to type stuff
12anyway i want to learn to play poker DX
7http://icanhascheezburger.com/2010/07/15/funny-pictures-apply-directly/ <-- :Ð­
03I know how to play poker
12i don't
03you just find a girl and poke 'er
/me runs
03nah, I do though
terrible pun, drf
XD
12indeed
12some people would eat you for that pun XD
03I also know how to play euchre
03which is a stereotypically MIchigan gme
03*game
03I didn't even know that
03I Just learned how to play it at a camp
03and then I was like "What? Only people in Michigan play euchre? LOL"
12it's the first time i heard of it
!define euchre
-!- a card game similar to ecarte; each player is dealt 5 cards and the player making trump must take 3 tricks to win a hand

Video Title: kerligirl13_s webcam video July 15, 2010, 02-52 PM [www.keepvid.com].mp4
7o.o
!define ecarte
-!- a card game for 2 players; played with 32 cards and king high
also warning slew of bad words, if it offends
12hmm
12so
12i just got to do 3 card tricks to win? :D
12pick a card pick a card
12is this your card?
03LOL
03no
03euchre is like
03you only play with 9, 10, and J/Q/K
03and ace
12whats a trick?
03then you pick a suit to be trump
03the jack of tha tsuit is the most powerful card
XD reminds me of a funny part on Loonet Tunes back in action "is this your card?" Bugs askes Elmer Fudd and licks it and puts it on Elmer's forehead
*looney
03then the jack of the other suit of the same color is the second most powerful
03then it goes Ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9
03and then someone plays a card
03you have to follow suit
03like if they play a club, you have to play a club
03unless you don't have one
03if you don't, you can play trump and win
12i remember this magic trick the magician that came to our school did
7Late about Excel: http://epicwinftw.com/2010/07/13/awesome-photos-oh-excel-is-good-for-something/
03the trick is the 4 cards that are played by the 4 people
7I'm guessing you saw, DRF?
7Yep.
03yes
03also EW OFFICE 2007
/me runs
12he made someone pick a random card then lifted a big piece of cardboard, hiding it from the audidence and asked if that was the card she picked, she nodded
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_AyDM3RLXc
03there, watch that
12the guy revealed his trick, i got such a kick out of it
12he had every card in the deck glued to the cardboard
12XD
03LOL, that guy is so serious
Is it just me or is Youtube really slow today? >_>

Mannimarco Ressurected

Mannimarco Resurected; Light and Dark
Daedric War
Elder Council
Deadly Reflexes <3
and such
Drake; I have GOTY for Oblivion too :P
04...
So then I'll be able to mod both games
04I hate you
:D
I shall be sheogorath while you...
be nothing
I have GOTY for PS3 and PC X3
and played the entire thing without mods on PC
and before you ask yes
I hate the Knights of the Nine
and hate that little bug for vamprism
04that's why you abuse the Soultrap glitch
044000+ on strength
(meaning you can never become a normal person again)
and since I killed Ranimus Polis...opps
:P
and Midas Magic
I
love
that mod
trying to activiate( or at least continue) with another mod
City of the dead
04you know what's really fun?
watching cartoons? o3o
04soultrap glitch on your speed (3000+) use levitate 1sec, Soultrap 1 sec on target, then fly out as far as you can into the ocean
I've never tried that XD
04it
04is
04fun
well
I
get to go
to eylswhere
..damnit
*elswere
04I wanna fight Mehrunes Dagon
well let me make you so very sad and very pitiful
04because the Oblivion storyline looks really fun
you dont fight him o3o
04yeah you do
04he's just invincible
and can crush you
04yes
04soultrap glitch solves all your problems
but I know a mod to which you can actually become High counciler of the Elder Council and rule the mythic dawn O:
04mythic dawn wat-
I think its called Servant of the Dawn
after main quest you can chose to become apart of the New Dawn
or just refuse
since in the oblivion story line you have to be good
04...whatever that is
erm..
Mythic Dawn=cult
04oh
cult=daedra worshipers
04I was hoping it was a ship or something
04anyway
lol daedra
I still like the DB
no, thats what the Dumner ship mods are for
they, sir, are awesome
that CAN FLY 8d
04are there Daedric Claymores in this game?
*D
Yes
and Daedric arrows
04...I want it
and Daedric aromor
and Daedric minnons
and Daedric monsters
04Daedric Claymores and Bows were my favourite weapons in Morrowind

Oblivion was freakin' hard
his plane
You never get this sense of feeling powerful
is exactly like Dagon
Everything scales with you and it doesn't get easier, just harder if anything
Dx
Well thats both good
yet bad
Yeah
I missed it, though.
good for it gives you a challenge
You got that sense of feeling powerful in Morrowind
BAD for it takes away what morrowind offered
you tranining yourself
Exactly!
but now? you are the son of god
you're like the jesus of the world XD
True.
"thus saith the lord OR DIE"
but I like how they made some factions enterable
like Dark Brotherhood
but what I extremely hate
is what they did to Mannimarco ;.;
BUT I WAS THE NEREVARINEEE
now people just say
and omg
yes
"oh that was his mortal form"
the Dark Brotherhood <3333
I mean wtf
the GOD OF WORMS
would come down there and kill everyone
but this <censored> style high elf
is just a anti-climatic end
yeah D:
so Mannimarco Revisited
makes it to wherer
if you are below level freaking 30
you die
he's that powerful
oh Spyro, do you have TF2 on the PC or xbox? :O

o.o
6so I pulled a quick one :P
hi PTS
2XD ah.
2hey, I wasn't the one
hi
02You're saying "you guys" as in?
2Lyon's always trying to dig stuff up
02...Dragon RP huh?
2I just sat there as he ranted on about what Kyu and you were planning
:3
!pokemon
2and speaking of which
2that guy doesn't help at ALL.
02mmk...
.-.
2he just adds fuel to the fire all day D:<
2Shiny

6hey it was hilarious and fun
02Nah, don't worry about it
02thanks
:o
!pokemon
6and Kyu and I both knew exactly what was going on
:O
Now that's not very nice
lol
2XD
/me yawns and curls up
2I couldn't care less if you guys are planning something, honestly
2I'll just watch it unfold and try to work stuff out about my OWN characters
2'cause I know nothing about them, honestly
6I originally was going to leave Kyu in the dark too
;o
http://uploads.mibbit.com/IQ4mSp.jpg
2Lyon and Kyu've basically thought up half of their histories, yeesh.
6but as plot overlord, I needed to converse with him
2lol
Altair
Would you read a 7000 word chapter?
we werent aloud to take the tour cuz we werent guest there but my bro took pix :p
**allowed
6so anyways

02I think they're a bit to obsessed over their characters IMHO
6shiny
02Awww, bye Roara D:
lol
02too* .-.
6you haven't seen our other-channel discussions
6we have all-out conversations
02I wouldn't want to, the art is enough
6that have lasted HOURS
:p
02Exactly my point
6hey, I admire it
02I would too
6they actually care to make their characters CHARACTERS
02but I'm not in it
6not just a design
6most of my characters have been scrapped for that reason
07!pokemon
Zappy, you are a 15Crobat.
07Fail, Zapdos.
12hmm
lol
02I spend hours on character design

6I need to go through and find all the ones I actually developed and toss the rest
http://mibpaste.com/smblKs
hmm it may not work for yall
6well
6I personally love being in the drp, it's fun being able to discuss this stuff
6anyways

12i love my character the way he is
hai ribbit
12but he doesn't fit in any RP
but then of the onestalking 2 of the 4 are already in it
:3
Hm?
Someone said Bioshock
You must ramble now
I see that
I must not
2lol
lol
I must press on at losing chess
2well, part of the reason being that he doesn't really...
2interact... at all...
02?
2with, well, anything.
12i've tried interaction a lot
2and I TRY to react to it but I usually can't
12no one thinks indirect interaction is good enough
2like right now where one of my characters is stuck in a warehouse quite a ways away
2... lol
2I do
2I just don't understand what kind of reaction you're looking for sometimes XD
2OKAY
2OCT entry or comic
2... OCT
2when I SHOULD be doing homework but no one cares about that
o3o
:O
12anything

12Sure
14Anyway ignoring that
14Arti: You're up early ovo
a tLOS packet with expected cliches was recieved
12Yeh ¬¬
14I'm not complaining but still XD
12Well I've been woken up every day at 5-6am for the past week so..

curly
hi
14Arti: I might have to go to the hospital soon :<
12Why???
14I might have possibly torn a muscle in my right shoulder .-.
:]
12How the hell dyou do that?
02Well
02You have a muscle
02and you tear it
/me waves.
14tried stopping myself from falling down a rather steep hill :\
/me oscillates
!pokemon
PTS, you are a 6Oddish.
02So...you tried hanging on to something?
t_t
14Yeh
03is Chevron Amethyst the same as Amethyst?
02I'm guessing the jerk is what did it then?
12How dyou fall down a steep hill?
14No nothing like that, I misplaced my footing
14Was climbing and stuff ._.
who was talking about mel gibbie yesterday?
02They might just be sore from that then
02Put heat on it
14Well the main fact that it stupidly hurts when I move my shoulder
14Even if it isn't a torn muscle, the chances of it being dislocated are high :<
02Well, I'm gonna say that they're just sore from the climb, unless you grabbed onto something while falling and gravity was still pulling you to cause a "jerk"
Sounds like an injury to a limb.
What happened.
o_O
dunno
!fapget
=(
14If I fell properly I would've broken my ankle or worse
02Then you most likely did tear your muscle
in #4chan
lol
02But I still think heat will help relieve the pain
So you tore a muscle near your ankle climbing, I'm guessing.
02Arm, not ankle
02I believe .-.
Oh
14and don't use those scripts in this chan :P
So yeah, go see a chiropractor if you really think you're injured there. He can confirm if you dislocated your arm or not.
not like they work
That is, if the injury is really as bad as you think it is.
12this season i want to actually do better in tournaments, so i need to practice
Redshark?
Oh, a cardgame simulator
12pokebeach's little program
12granted
Like the tcg version of smogon
12i don't know if the deck i'm testing
12can do anything against your little feraligatr blastoise contraption
12i can outspeed it no doubt but still
Well maybe we might be able to battle in the morning if you remind me.
!lag
12or if i'm awake
Or that
12i usually won't get out of bed until about 1:30PM your time XD
07Had to re-instal java D:
12i guess if i play the manectric version
12i would REALLY irritate your feraligatr blastoise deck XD
121 electric, 30 to everyone with a power
Grass weakness :/
/me squeaks
12i know
And yeah
12manectric still does 30 though
12grass weakness
12might actually make things more interesting XD
12since i play masquarine
Ha ha ha
121 energy pretty much says "i do 100 to feraligar and i get to draw 2 cards"
12then you do 20 less to me
Maybe I could make a second deck there for my speedrill strategy.
12i dunno
12beedrill is dead
12literally
I know
12btw
It has a month to live
12i almost beat a beedrill deck at a tournament with giratina once XD
After that, my deck is scrap
12martini, i loved that deck
I wonder what I should make out of that deck
12i had 3 of his beedrill in the lost card zone
12XD
12he beat me on time
0_0 well good for him
12i know i hate that when that happens >_>
I run mine with shaymin, though
12we even played the game on
12till someone won the way it's supposed to work
12and i won pretty much
Preferably, you
Yep
Ninja'd me to it
12i wanted to put the 4th beedrill into the lost card zone
12just for laughs but i ran out of poketurns for luxray
04eep
12martini was so fun
12basically get a giratina lv. x powered up
12use luxray or pokemon reversal to bring up their claydol
12then spread around claydol
12the idea was tested and was effective, i destroyed so many decks doing that, probably the most devastating was when my opponent had 3 feraligatr prime in his lost card zone
12along with both his claydols and 13 energy
mep

She is as delicious as tea!
04from what i recall
it might be behind him
/me is drinking delicios tea
/me pokes where with her new vampire fingers :O
04the tree doesn't grow until you do something that involves getting the mask you win at the horse races

/me saves Where and turns him too ^-^

would you rather be a werewolf?
which is why once you beat it, you never play it again
/me cuddlewuddles Curly :3
I wouldn't mind being a vampire in real life
04ocarina of time was a lot more fun

*crazy bloodshot eye face*
Dead Space is a bloody harsh game XD
I know
didnt particularly like it myself
0.0
/me pokes you to get TF: WFC
TF WFC?
transformers war for cybertron
Maybe
/me pleads yuo to
tbh I've never been a big fan of Transformers, but that game looks fun, I might consider it
bye
cya
D:
you're the first person in my LIFE to say they dont like transformers!
/me cries
I didn't say I didn't like them
I'm just not a bigfan tis all
well you liked gears of war dont you?
Yep
cos WFC is similar and with full campaign co op
but dude its better to just lurch forward in vehicle mode, transform and slice a decepticon with a big mofoing axe than it is to just duck and cover all the time
XD
also its like halo, where you can rip a gun from a turret and walk around with a BFG and waltz around like the juggernaut beeotch!
also the boss battles are good, especially the final bosses
I prefer Ninja Gaiden 2 for boss battles :P
srsly though best boss battles ever were on Metroid Prime for me
I couldn't choose tbh
Also !espeon
W00T! I agree all the way, Nick xD

I'm going back to playing Dead Space idleness
looks like the papers have been printing the names of people who are giving their sympathies to Raoul Moat on Facebook instead of the poor coppers who got killed and blinded
hmmm?
the english gunman from tyneside, near where I live
pathetic criminal wanabee kids have been on his page on facebook saying hes a legend and wished he killed more coppers and people
5D:
hey roara
5Hi Aurora. ^^
hey
just here while I eat :>
whats worrying is the page has gathered 30,000 members
6I know I just joined, but whats bad about a page getting 30,000 members?
yeah
right i gotta go bye
5@Aurora :: The owner of the page is a gunman. And I guess a lot of the comments are praise.
Swimtaim.
its in tribute the gunman raoul moat aurora
6._.
not sure if you heard about him but he went on a shooting spree near where I live right after the cumbrian shootings
6o-o
so yeah 30,000 people giving greivances to a killer instead of the victims is morally wrong
it's Facebook.
what do you expect
it's fun to troll
lol
that and it goes to show how the young british generations are 'broken'
nah
has nothing to do with British
6it just goes to show that young people are stupid
6:|
not stupid
they just troll for the sake of trolling
I kinda lul'ed at that
the fact that he has so many fans
6what page is this?
its been taken down now
just found out
6oh
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1295025/Raoul-Moat-tribute-page-pulled-Facebook.html

...the downside of a corporate mobile phone: Your manager can call you out of after-work and back to work for him

04I hope all night unless Burnett's friends come round to use call of duty but I doubt it
12Yes lol-v-
04Xai's initials are already RN
12We;ve all made that joke before XD
yeah R_N, you should sue her for cpyright infringement
...LOL good point
12LOL
I somehow overlooked that
LOL THEY'D BOTH HAVE THE SAME INITIALS
12LMAO
04Yes
well except the middle one
lol
Heya pplz~
04I'd be NB if I got married rather than NP now
your middle initially isn't an I, is it?
/me runs
04well, NJB but I don't use my middle name. And Hi Aero
oh
well NIB is an auction term "New in box"
04Why is it bad if I was my middle name?
thought that would be funny :P
hi hi aero
it's not bad
04Oh xD
it would be funny
04Also NIP
or "NUB" is a slang for n00b
XD
04I nip people
LOL
04I refer to my fiance as JWB in texts to his mum lol it's quicker
04Like 'can you give JWB the keys'
04Oh and Arti...

12Ra?
04someone in our local chinese is called Xai...
04but it stands for a longer name
Yeah I was gonna say
04and you say it 'chai'

4my chat screen went black
4hey, i'm still connected?
7Yep.

!define frumious

4i wonder if it has something to do with the n64 emu
7Oh yeah, from Jabberwocky. O_o
4well
4i'm leaving
4it was nice chatting with you guys
Ah okay
cya then o3o
G'evening peoples.
7Hai.
Yes, I do know of it. I use it frequently.
7:D
03I use that too
03Finale Notepad 2003a
03back when it was legitimately free
I have the full version of Finale 2007c.
7Can you fiddle around and fix a piano arrangement, please? o.o
7Printmusic 2010. ._.
7I have an older version of Finale Notepad somewhere...
7But I think that one's 2008. :/
Ah. Yeah, I'm currently stuck with anything up to and including version 2007c. Past that, the only way possible is via MusicXML
03that's the best one :P
03I have a 2004 "demo"
7I've never tried MusicXML, but might as well now.
I have the full version of 2K3 and 2K4 though the reason I have those I would care not to explain; 2007c is because I pirated 2007... and then patched it. :P
7Okay, exported;
7Will upload.
Which upload service you use?
7Imagehost.
Ah
7http://h.imagehost.org/download/0195/VVVVVV_Positive_Force_Single_Piano
7I'd like your music expertise for polishing this. o3o
So what do ya need? (Also, because of Finale's growth apparently there were XML errors, which Finale ignored, and it's open. Did you use any accidental or slurs, or multiple "tracking" in the pice at all? 'Cause if you did, it kind of... went away.)
7One piano, treble and bass tracks. There should be a key change in-between.
/me falls out of the internet.
7Dynamics is what I'm looking for the most.
/me patches the hole
/me curls into a ball and sleeps.
Alrighty, so it has everything so far. That is good which is nice for a change.
/me waves
7Good. :)
/me zzz
Though, you know you can get a bit more texture out of parts if you use a secondary track/layer for some of the notes (less in measure ties.
7Hmm. Well, this is a piano arrangement. o.o
7I could give you the two-piano version...
I'm gone for the weekend
Bye everyone
:O
:<
:c
12LOL Kyu
12Smogon voted to make Salamence an uber
12i see they put back latias as well
It's an arrangement of a Buxtehude piece.
7Sorry, we can't find "www.mfi.re". We suggest that you check the spelling of the web address or search above.
MediaFire fails... http://www.mediafire.com/?g67uiaop8ub1qab
7Ah, those layers?
Yes.
7Problem is if you have, let's say, a quarter-rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, and a quarter note. On another layer, you have quarter rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, eighth rest, and eighth note.
7Or if you want, fill in one set of quarter rests with notes.
Well... there is a nice way of getting around the problem... for a print out.
One simple hides one set of rests and then just moves the other rests downward/upward to fill the blanks.
7Hides, eh?
Yep.
7How? o.o
In a different piece I've arranged (W. Byrd's "The Bells [Of Osney]" there are measures that call for a third layer... for a single note... so yay H key. :P )
7o.o
In F2007 all you need to do to hide a note/rest is have it selected is just hit the 'H' key.
7That's not working on PrintMusic. O_o
Hmm... time for the manual?
7http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/PrintMusic2010Win/PrintMusic_Left.htm#CSHID=9501|SkinName=NewWindow <-- dah?
(I don't know diddly about the new Finale versions.)
7Huh, that's strange:
7It says to press H or O.
7Ah, I have to Ctrl-click.
So you use Speedy Entry?
7Nope. o.o
7Lol.
Simple entry is the same basically... Ctrl click and then H.
7But, oy, reformatting the music. D:
7Well, thanks for the tip, anyway.
7I'll get to it tomorrow.
Your quite welcome.
Oh, has the newer version of Finale given you more layers?
7Four. o.o
(F2007 is still on four layers, though I do believe there are 8, I don't have easy access to the remainder.)
/me 7jots that down
7You don't mean the ^, do you?
Yes that one.
Also the ">" articulation also adds a tiny bit of volume.
An example of those accidentals can be found in my arrangment of Sousa's "The Stars and Stripes Forever" (for six-hand piano): http://mfi.re/?28us7stullietlk
(No... bad media fire... don't give me a junk link... http://www.mediafire.com/?28us7stullietlk )

/me yawns
Hi everyone :)
xD
hi
heeey Ariiii~
Can't sleep right now.
Actually, I just finished FMA volume 6 15 minutes ago.
I've run out of manga to read ;_;
12D:
12think of a deck idea
One that's not going to cost me a few limbs to get, preferably.
12budget decks
12are amazingly easy to make
I'll sell my kingdra for it if I have to
12which kind of kingdra?
Prime
12oh
12i've been looking for dragon pump lol
And normal, actually
Not selling that one since I don't think it would sell for much
Compared to prime, of course.
12i think a good kingdra deck
12plays 3 prime and 1 normal
12otherwords kingdra loses to fire types
I've got 1 prime and 1 normal. Go figure that the deck I have the most materials for is the most expensive deck to get.
12what would that be?
See above
I don't even have fifty dollars to spend
On decks, that is
12i don't see it
That's for an upcoming game
Kingdra
Deep
Derp*
12kingdra isn't that expensive
12primes cost like nothing XD
12i think luxchomp depending on the build can easily be the most expensive deck
12considering some people play 2-2 Luxray
/me falls out of a quit message.
I blame deathgrip for that d/c.
:OOOO
Hmm... That would make a kick a screenname
HEY
:3
:o
/me curls into a ball.
12lol
Or a 1hko move in gen 5
:p
12kingdra is certainly going to bea deck to fear
12i am positive i can beat it with obama though
12XD
But that would be the second water deck I make
Ah well
12hmm maybe i should make feraligatr abomasnow XD
0_0
12evolve snover into abomasnow
12below zero 60 paralyzed
12next turn super scoop up, pick up abomasnow, bring up another snover, rain dance 3 water to snover, then evolve into abomasnow, 60 paralyzed
/me runs like he'll
12keep repeating that process for as long as you can XD
but the use ends there.
Not a good pokemon to keep lying around.
12after that you jut snow play until you lose a couple abomasnow then bring up feraligatr prime
12everone has like 60-80 damage on them
12making feraligatr prime's attack quite a serious threat
X
It has a high retreat, high movecost, and you'll run out of energies once you use them up on your other pokemon
The third more so than the rest
So run fisherman or something to get the energies back
Oh sh
I forgot to order some pokemon communications a week ago
O.O"
12i have a guy who sells cards in my area
12he overprices a lot of things but a lot of things i can get him on
where, wanna be a target for my quickscope practicing? c:
12for example he sold me 15 pokemon collector for 5 dollars
12lol
I hate you again
:/
Anyways, I have a cardstore that could sell me this stuff.
12heh
And I could sell a few of my cards through them as well
12i'm going to go to that guy next week
Get rid of this lanturn
12to see if he'll buy any of my old cards
I just give away all my old cards to younger league members because I'm generous lime that
Like*
I wish I could sleep.
12i dunno sometimes i think it will confuse them more than anything
12giving them a bunch of old cards that they won't be able to play later
Well the professor did that, too.
:p
12basically the SV Magmortar has that power
I'm going to try to get some sleep again
/me goes to bed
night o/
bai Curly
Nah, I'm gonna take the dog for a walk.

dog for a walk

Yeah'
I do the food there

PST
/me too.
Curly, have you been to the cultus waterpark?
Curly, time remaining?
a few times
Ooh.
I just tried to "install" it
There is no install.
but it opened the game and I tried to quit and my computer froze
Not with the zip file.
:<
so I rebooted >_>
today this fat chinese guy yelled at us to charge his iphone for him
Curly, what file did you run?
we said no but he put it on the counter and left
the 32 bit one
..File name?
so we plugged it in, and we accicently dropped it into the bucket full of bleach
...Oh god.
o_o
needless to say, the screen no longer works.
remind me to never trust you with electronis
electronics*
I didnt drop it.
Curly, phew.
Curly, just hit ESC twice.
Curly, if you show up there sometime ask if Brad is there.
(this summer)
okays ^^
/me takes it that Spyro's name is Brad then :o
:3
Ill tell the manager you are being unruly and get you kicked out if you lie.
like*
Everyone knows my name.
lol
if I lie about what? o.o
like*
/me used to know another brad on ECNet.
oh xD
There is another brad on ecnet
me.
geekguy
Thats who it was.
Yep.
we threw some idiots out today who smuggled booze inside
there was this guy who brought a bag of weed in there to sell to people
...
I never managed to go down the really steep slide at Cultus Lake >.>
/me is scared to death of that thing
04=3
we confinscated it, and he didn't even take off, he stayed inside the park while we called the cops.
12Hey you ^v^
Curly, I haven't either.
I actually dont like waterslides.
12hi Articuno
really?
Not out of fear, I just don't like them,/
04Im playing on my English SS
Hell of a job for you, then.
well I've gone down every other slide except that one >.>
12i was messing with pokebeach chat members XD
I dont have to do anything with the waterslides.
/me likes the valley of fear
what's your job there?
Valley of fear is what the waterpark is known for.
I do food.
04I hope an events coming up soon
ohboy
fish & chips, burgers, stuff like that.
How'd that guy react when he came back for his phone?
12considering i haven't set foot in that chatroom since 2006 i was curious to see if any one remember me
04Its kinda likely cos they usually have one during summer
Proto, he yelled some more and we had to kick him out.
Was it an iPhone4?
XD
how long have you worked there Spyro?
12Hey Glac ^^
He's gonna sue. I can feel it.
12Lol
Like, a month
12i irritated so many people XD because i wouldn't say who i was
ah, okay
04Lol
I doubt he will.
woulda been funnier
even if he does, he agreed to the park policy when he entered that holds us unliable if something gets ruined
04eep
12i had one of them playing the "guess who" game because one of them knew i was logged on their forums so he kept asking me questions like "does your name start with a capital letter?"
04Thats a distance from me
We didnt ruin it on purpose
Ooh.
Well that works out.
reminds me of xkcs
xkcd*
12Newcastle's a distance from me XD but at least we have the car and to be honest.. we can get the train free as well cos Xai's a train driver XD
if he wants to be a jackass, thats fine, but if he crosses the line between being a jackass and pissing us off, then thats when he gets kicked out.
04I dont ._.
12hmm
btw iphone 4 isnt in canada yet.
oh
der
we are safe from the horrors of the death grip.
/me needs money for shaymin. :(
morning Arti
Was it you who said that Apple said all phones do that?
04Im in a cottage for a week
apple did say that
they said that again at their press conference
like yesterday
04I'ss lovely
12Where ? ^^
04Lake District
12*^^
/me wants a ut D:
I tried to get my nexus to drop bars but it wouldn;t.
12Oh nice XD we were gonna go there this weekend.. what part?
lol
04Uhh...I keep forgetting >.<
ut?
12Gah XD
04Somewhere around Hawkshead
apple said what?
That all phones drop signals when held wrong
you know what I love about a german breakfast? The wonderful-delicious bread :)
12Well I'll show you on Google maps where we usually go, family member has a caravan
...
apple said that anyone who buys their products are idiots.
what the hell >_>
04It's raining.
my sentiments exactly, Curly
:3
Not to keep it going.
But to make it better.
No.
tell me WHAT you need $150 for.
I know for sure you wontpay that per month
Actually..Only $75.
ah, one thing Arti: Do you have any idea if wild camping is allowed in england/near you?
For a one-time installment of 1GB RAM.
/me only has 256MB right now.
Almost maxed it out with shaymin irc, apache, and 3 UrT servers.
I was like 5MB from maxing it.
Cut out one of the ut servers?
Even with 1 UrT server it's at 128.
how much are you paying a month?
$20.
12Yes in certain places, more so in Scotland as there's endless land there but you're more at risk of being shot by hunters XD
for $50/month you can colo a server at volumedrive
/me shrugs.
I thought shaymin would be easier.
I might colo some time.
I doubt I'll be shot whilst sleeping in a campervan :)
/me doesn't have that kind of budget. XD
but id stick the server in vancouver so I could physically go to it.
12Thats NOT camping ¬¬
and id set up VPSs on it for things.
it is - but still a bit different
/me isn't completely sure where his server is.
I know it's Seattle.
04We're gonna take a look at the shops today, apparently there's a wide range of stuff.
12Try some camping in a tent in wild Scotland, so much fun <3
12I'm curious ^^
04Ok lol.
if I could id get Shaw's 100mbps at my uncle's office
04I'll ask Mum once she wakes up.
but it costs big bucks..
shaw is a scam anyways
maybe I'm just a bit too lazy, but I prefer a real bed over pure soil :P
04Im making my way to the League on SS
I like shaw. for my home net anyway
12I lost my DS :/
04Oof!
oO
12It's in my house somwewhere.. I hope
04My team so far;
12Because last time I had it was in this room.. then poof
/me really only got Shaymin to practice owning a server.
Can we play now pleeease? :D
04BIRDY the Pidgeot lv 37, Wibble the Poliwrath lv 37, Torment the Misdreavus 38, SickEmMOAR the Sudowoodo 36, Parsley the Meganium 38
With 10GB HDD and 256MB RAM, this really isn't a real server. XD
12LOL
04Which ones your favourite? =p
12I like the name Parseley
12and SickEmMOAR LOLZ
04I got it from a kids show, the Herbs, Parsley the Lion
12that's genius XD
12I remember that :3
04Yeah, see whut I did thar?
lol
12Yes XD I love it
12It actually took me a few seconds to get it
/me is ready o>
I don't think I'm going to play considering what my computer did >.>
D:
/me will try later
Nooooooo
I could play if I could stand in one place and snipe >.>
come on...
We need at least 4. D:
Proto, sure.
XD
Proto, I've got just the map.
/me looks up for the link
http://urbanterror.info Proto
Gracias, senor
What am I looking for now
found it
I could never really figure out where to put my programs on linux' file system >_>
I wish there was a 'program files' folder :I
http://www.urbanterror.info/docs/texts/110/
Curly, my UrT is on my desktop.
I don't like using my desktop :<
Does it matter if I download voxel or quake unity?
I suggest Quake Unity if you live NW USA.
I live in florida
But they're the same files.
I found another tracer of your most famous (and hated by you) Lugia pic^^
What's that map that I think is one of the default ones for ut, it's like an arabic merchant quarter place
|
Algiers?
i don't knwo how else to describe it
Yeah i think that;s it
funny how people always insist they didn't trace it, but if you take the picture and overlay it on the original, almost every single line fits^^
12THe one of Lugia under the sea with all the anatomical errors?
Yeah
That's the one
,3 it
<3
Sure
correct
/me watches his download speed climb
12Lol XD
12Link?
wow this sucks
yes?
110kb/s
1sec
-_-
D:
D:
use a download manager pto
proto
12o-o
sure
What's a good download manager for chrome
Let's go.
Coming!
and it's funny how people instantly start insulting as soon as you've lifted the curtain around their fraud
12That isn't traced though
12I think I know my own art enough
12He's made it even more anatomically incorrect
04lol
so failing in copying a fail? xD
04lololol
12LOOL
12Well yes I guess
reminds me in the song of Meowth during Pokemon Live! :)
"We're the best in being the worst!"
12XD
04lol
04oxymoron's FTW
No plays for me :o

12Yeh
12It's annoying, I've tried moving it, no luck
12I tried to place it under recent visitors, under the buddy list.. it won't move
12i was about to say that is such an illogical place to put it
12XD
12Well it moves, but goes into error or causes display issues
12the fun of webbuilding
12I'd even be better right at the top
12and yeh XD
12I'll ask Lugia for help maybe
12I should have done when he was here

12I know of it, not too much about it
http://verydemotivational.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/demotivational-posters-wait.jpg
someone saw such a plane - the body completely clean and polished. So he asked the pilots: "Wow, what you use for polish?"
answer: "Speed-only, sir!"
12:>
a DC-3....speed....lol^^
12Is that a joke or a real quote though?
a real quote in fact
that's what makes it even more funny^^
and know what's even more funny?
12Lol what?
a guy came to our airschool and complained about our planes. About the radio being so damn f***ed up because nobody could understand him
12Ovo
he turned around....and we almost started laughing....
...he still wore his headset...but the microphone was set on the BACK of his HEAD...
12LOL!
12Fail, let me tell Xai
but yeah, yeah, our crappy radios....yeah^^

Noooooooooooooooo
I just crashed Opera by opening too many Know Your Meme tabs
04>> just tried to go to a shopping centre, an out of town one - there was a constant stream of cars going in there and no where to park so I had to come back without going in.
04I'll try again later haha
12I think Summer hols just started ¬¬
04In some counties it's next week
04I mean, Friday of next week.
04A lot of car drivers are selfish too, I just needed one person to let me out so I could drive through and no one would xD

12I's back!
omg - call 911#
04wb
or 112 or 411 or...bleh, erm, whatever
04999 here xD
12^^
12I wish I had someone to go out with right now
12Its a nice evening and Im gonna be stuck here
04I'm bored too, I just talked to the girl in the corner shop for ages LOL
12Poor girl *runs*
12Just kidding
12I wish it was me
04Burnett's at work til 9pm then I'll pick him up LOL and hehe she was ok I know her, we always talk.
04A lot of people in Asda are only getting 4 days off a month now >>
12Thats ridiculous
04Well it's overtime but they have to take overtime to make ends meet if that makes sense?
04Cos the contracts are 16 hours, then the rest is overtime if you wanna be able to go out and stuff.
12Ohh I see
04Maybe they should pay their staff a bit more but they can't because then the prices would go up...LOL so people have to do overtime XD
12Lmao
04That also means they need less staff and it saves them money.
12I forgot why but can't burnett get another job?
04Sometimes though, Burnett has to do 3 10 hours shifts in a row.
04There isn't anything else.
04I'm having trouble looking for stuff but I can't work in Asda because I don't like retail work. I would if I had to though. :)
12He wont do office stuff will he?
04No he doesn't like it.
04Plus it's very hard to find office work even for me who has 3-4 years' experience at the min.
12Yeh ¬¬
04I'm not worried though, my mum was asking for £350 board a month plus I had to pay my bills and buy my own food, my situation is better than that even now LOL

12Everyone else just goes "Oops" and laughs

12It's automatic
ZING

12LOL yes, you are
12Seriously if you can't read, not my problem
12Rules are there
yea, rules are there if you don't connect via the site chat
12Er
not going against rules or anything
but
12Don't you mean the other way round?
/me highfives SpooKy!
it's called sarcasm
dumbass.
xd
12Yeh cos you can really tell sarcasm on the internets
XD*
12Anyway
12I don't tolerate name calling here either :3
yes, you can
04Someone's an anon wannabe xD
wut
04Seriously, a Dutch 12 year old thinking he can take on a chat....
04This is very entertaining.

04Yup, you are.

12LOL!
12Wow NOW who's butthurt
04No - the Netherlands is one of my fave countries.
Articuno all you can do is abuse your powers
how lame
04Don't get butthurt about a country's name being mentioned.
ohai sky
12I can kick you off too but I'm having too much fun
O.o im not RN
/me rawrs.
04Hehe just kidding.
/me radda radda
04Was joining in the 'let's all pretend we are anon and fail at it' thing that kid's got going on.
12WHAAAAAA I GOT KILLED FOR SWEARING ON A KIDS SITE!!!!!
wow
12AND IM A KID MYSELF
/me claps
12Yeh I know, great impression of you, almost perfect
if its seriously that annoying Arti, just ignore him
04It's too entertaining xD
12Lol read up, he's not annoying, he's entertaining
04When people like that come in it's just so funny.
Articuno, you're a <censored> retarded dumbass who kills over a swear word/name calling, how pathetic can you be retarded <censored>
12I think the funniest part is how he (or she) sits there and takes it all
so am i :P but i usually dont show it
10...lol
I find it more amsing that damn, hell and other words are accepted at this site but words that start with h and end with y :P
04LOLOLOLOLOL look at that xD he really tried
04omg that has to go in the peas
12Hell is a swear word? XD
12I heard it wasn't
04It's not
04it's the name of a place in the bible and as far as I know, the bible doesn't contain swearing.
they might consider it...well hell but its usually a name to 'swear' at someone
04So therefore the word 'damn' isn't swearing either. Do you think they'd allow swearing in the bible? xD
12Can't remember, a load of them from chat
Yes
afaik
they allow ALOT in the bible
04But then they have swear words in the bible Andrew.
heh
04I don't think their god would be pleased with that.
Radda?
14Not here long
i love how the bible contradicts itself so much
their god doesnt care XD
im back
yesh
04In fact they can go to Hell for swearing, so why is there so much swearing in the bible? xD
04Hello loser :)
12LOL!

/me watched chowder recently

k D:
04At least they're not the ones that start at 9am
gnaw laters D:
english alcohol culture sucks
12Yes.. couldn't agree more, thats why I love City Inn :3
/me animorphs
04It's expensive there and there's no smirnoff ice
yeah that place was really classy
04lolololol
04yeah I felt out of place xD
12Why? I went there in a jumper and jeans once
12as long as you're well behaved, you fit
04Yeah but only if you have loads of money XD XD XD
04to stay there all night I mean xD
12Meh, I guess but the type of people who go don't stay there all night :23
12*:3
04Yeah I suppose, but it's a bit of a waste of taxi fare XD
04unless they go home and are still talking to their friends and stuff
a bet a lot of people go there before going to clubs
12I don't think so
12Just because of the price
04I didn't like the taste of the drink I got LOL
well you won't get the student types that go to crappy studenty clubs
LOOOOOL at pic RN
12Anyway when I get married, I might hold my hen night there, or part of it. Iwant to have a restaurant meal
anyway I really need to go >v<
12at some other restaurant though XD and then go to City Inn
04That's cool, cos I didn't want to go round chavvy clubs
I wanna stay and chat D:
2does anyone know what an m3u is?
2... oooh, okay, thanks.
I am away
Well
I am now
12I didnt like the drink I got either D: but thats because it had too much alcohol, was too bitter
laters
2well, I mean, like
04I'm not gonna have a hen night, less internet time xD
2not.... where you usually are bye!
04at this rate we'll be getting married in 2020 lol - unless we have just a 2 witness thing which we don't mind :)
I wonder why people ask others what a specific filetype might be...instead of asking google
04Burnett is very much a chavvy club type lol but some people are just like that :)
haha
well the metal club i go to is a bit of a dive
04I don't like metal clubs, too many emos
hmm true
04and - too many 12 year olds pretending to like rock music
04but I don't mind over 18 ones
but in this one there's an emo room where the emos stay away from the metalheads
12LOL!!!!!
Andrew; to preserve peace? :P
i like rock rock
04there's a club here where the rock fans have to walk upstairs through the chavs
:D
Brother - indeed :P
they pretend liking rock music...in fact they like hiphop and all the crap
04yeah
04and they like rock music for like...a month
/me listens to only Linkin Park :D
04I'm pretty tolerant of most music
I usually hate it when they make good songs into rock variations
04right, going for the night now cos got to go out and then pick Burnett up from work
12Ok

D:
D:
We didn't take that much video
/me gets the cattle prod ready
;_;
It's... good enough, I guess.
LOL
Now update the blog. :p
I only saw a 2 second vid. :o
Since it says otherwise.
drawing a scar?
a line
coloring one?
02o.o
oh
good enough
a line with little bits of shading/lighting in it
:D
Do it anyways, Proto.
and not just a straight line, make it have little bulges
/me presses the button
/me went on an internet meme pilgrimage today
12what color though
Here, you try :D
/me pounces the feather covered bed and meows as it looks like she just ate a bird
And
I'm the only one who knows where that video was taken :D
IN THE WORLD :D
mwahahahaha
12hello
:(
hi
pinkish
12hi
12it's inder 18!!!!!!!
or a lighter color of what you have
/me runs
/me eatted Things' bird?
noooo, poor birdy :(
12also the bulges, wouldn't that depend on what the scar was from?
12i'm trying to make scars from being cut by a sword like thing
12maybe a couple stab scars
:D
oooooo
/me looks
stab scars would be irregular circles
but even a sword would have buldges
bulges
If someone would post on it :3
12i see
the skin would fold over as it was cut, giving it irregular cuts
12i'm not even sure about how to make these "bulges"
Is there actually anything to post about? o.o
._G
hmm
have you ever drawn a line with a pen
XD
and the ink causes small little bulges from too much ink?
...LOL!!!
OH GOD LOL
:D
A sarcastic one, but a comment nonetheless. :p
:O!
/me is licked
but where? ;3
/me SHOT!
:D
12i'm using photoshop lol
12but yeah
12i believe i've done that with marker
But anyone
:O
:3
Someone digg that
:3333333333!
Or something
/me hides
well, PS can do it too
just draw a line
and then randomly place little thicker parts
:3
Mah blog postings?
no
show
12ok
03btw guys
03apparently people don't know about this
03but for students
03you can sign up for Amazon Student
^ :o
03and get Amazon Prime free for a year
03:)
03(Gives you free 2-day shipping on almost anything)
12so basically Roara, you are talking about making a line
12but other parts are thicker than the rest
:D
also back
:D
/me has acting skills :D
I also have a kitty
12how do you shade a scar
02o.o
:o
well
07o3o
imagine it as a depression in the skin
no, can't do that, universe will segfault
light source, shade the depression much as you would shade the inside curve of a bowl
12hmm
12ok
/me gives Roara a biscuit and tells kyu to post
12thx
12i dunno how much you helped, but you did give me some insight at least

/me gives drf an apple (fruit)
Hi
can anyone help explain something to me
?
hello?
nvm later everyone
quiet
03yeah
03I'm just reminiscing (sp) about some old games I loved
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_X8YQRIsA <-- this is like, the coolest thing ever
insert crikets here
03both the game, that level, and the music
03er, both LOL, w/e the word is
what game is that o-o
03Commander Keen
03that particular one is game 6
03they were made in 1991, same year I was born :)
03old computer games, whcih is why it's fricking amazing
that music at first reminded me of goldeneye
which is an awesome game
03as it could easily have been SNES, it was literally groundbreaking
03like for its time it was the most amazing thing ever
03now I'll play it and people will be like "WTF?"
03it's a little odd, but I love it
03the story is like this 10 year old kid who fights aliens with a stun gun XD
xD
03and he has a "Bean and Bacon Megarocket"
03as in he built his spaceship out of bean and bacon cans
03XD
that is serious win
03weird, yes. But loads of fun, also yes
03and yeah I know XD
imagine hold up that in a bank robbery
*holding
03what, a stun gun?
hands up! this is a bean and bacon megarocket!
03ah
03XD yeah
03I grew up with that game, before we ever had a console
03I first got an N64 when I was like 11 LOL
03before that, it was just Keen, that's all I had
I'm trying to remember this computer game I was highly addicted to when I was 4
03that and like Tetris LOL
03for Windows
all I remember is some guy jumping over fire
03heh
SUPER old
but argh
something about how the fire looked
made me happy
still does, like one of those comfort things you barely remember from diaper age
03yeah
03I literally played Commander Keen from the time I was like 3 up til now
03i quite literally grew up with it
I remember playing on my grandma's windows 95 LOL
that thing was beastly
win95 + whatever box she had with it
crap
now I really wanna remember that game
03LOL
03Get this
03our Windows 95 computer literally cost $3500
03that's how much computers were back then
D:
03and it was't even that great, it was just a normal Compaq desktop
$3500 of our day or those days?
03those days.
those days it would be even more today
03my dad found the receipt lying around LOL
..
D:
03after all these years
03and I was like OMGLOL
how did my grandma afford that LOL
03we bought it at Comp USA
03which doesn't even exist anymore
03and who knows XD
03I mean I'm sure they weren't ALL that much
03maybe like $2000 was a lower end computer
03but still, they were really expensive compared to now
/me is done reading BT guide
/me is sewing
03http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/ <-- if anyone is bored
03that's the history of Commander Keen

crap I shoulda been watching that thread
LOL
you liez like cake
12fish
03LOL, Commander Keen was only 8, not 10
03I thought he was 10
ah
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG_X8YQRIsA <- gameplay
03I posted it here a little while ago
/me explodes.
wow that hurt my eyes
03LOL
03why, because of the quality?
03yeah, it kinda sucks
02woah
02http://www.lugia.us/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,129/topic,3749.msg210942#new
03plus the guy totally cheated and is using God mode
it's rerally good
03hence why he never dies >_>
02read from the top of that page
considering the date
03well
03the video itself has crappy quality
oh
lol
03like it's all pixelated
well yeah
03the game itself looks better
03but I can only find so much XD
03but yeah, it basically looks like a SNES game
03and I STILL like SNES graphics over 3D ones XD
03I think it's more fun
if there's any 90s game I really like, its the first Fallouts :P
03like meh, those super realistic games bug me
03I like the corny 2D ones XD
03like Sonic and SMB and whatnot
03those are more fun
03and often more hard
03Donkey Kong was like, the hardest game ever
03to beat
oh god
I could never beat that
03only 3 people beat the entire game
03ever
03so yeah
03old games > new ones IMO
03The new one have better graphics but they're kinda meh otherwise
I dont even REMEBER how to beat Super Mario 64
Fallout 1 and 2 > Fallout 3
in even graphics
for, when you somehow get a critical hit
its as if you really blew half of them up o3o
12i personally like games that are easier to beat
12lol
12but have side quests you can do that takes a lot of challenge
But eh I'm a Dawn of War fan also
its entire series is awsome
:o
/me falls asleep
12i think 90% of the N64 games they made were harder than heck
Kirby 64 <3
I hope she doesn't get on like *right* after I turn off my monitor
Oh well, she has my cell phone
Super Mario 64 was INSANELY hard though
Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
LOL
wut
well, longer moreso than hard
Kirby 64?
dude
kirby 64 is one of my favorite games ever
EVER
12what happened to kirbies 1 through 63?
they got rejected
I now Star Fox 64
*know
02!stats

OMG
LOL I literally burst out laughing at that
Yes, OMG, OMG, OMG!
6I'm still laughing lolololol
Haha, thanks.
interesting name
Thank you.
6liek, omg, do I know you?
6</beverlyhillsstyle>
It originates from the IRC channel modes I was experimenting with the other day, went into a channel (with IRC Operator privileges) and set channel modes +OMG
12lol Roara
though it'd be more interesting if it was OMFG :P
6xD
You could set OMfG
Sadly, F is not a valid channel mode.
12i still think MGS is more epic
12would be fun
I don't get it.
that is old series
MGS is possible to set, and so are some swear words.
03um
03why?
12Metal Gear Solid
Just curious, or do you need a better explanation than that?
03seems kinda stalkerish to walk in and ask who the ircops are
Usually the nicks of a network's IRC operators are in the MOTD.
6...
03we don't even have a MOTD LOL
6how the heck do you know drf is an ircop?
6oh
6wait
I did a /whois on her.
12Roara
12did you hoestly ask that question?
her?!
6HER?
LOOOL
03I'm a guy LMAO
6LOOOOOOOL
LOOOOOOOOOL
03I'm a guy
Okay, I apologise.
6it's ok
12he's a guy
why dont we call DRF an it and call it even?
/me shot
03No
Sorry, Mr. DRF.
12as far as we are concerned :P
6some people, it's hilarious genderconfusing them
03yeah
yup
6OH
03people who know me know I'm definitely a guy
03on that note
03PIX OR GTFO
6there
6forgot to oper identify
03-ocean.lugia.us- Aurora (4750e9be@TST-85D6C177.mibbit.com) [Aurora] is now an operator (O)
03whee
03XD
You don't need to use your exact oper nick to be able to oper up.
You can oper from your Roara nick as well.
12i find it sad you guys all got IRCop
12just because you were around at just the right time
6lol
6hmm
12i feel excludd ;-;
12*excluded
6I thought I tried identifying from another nick and it refused
12i'm not going to ask a question like that are you nuts?
6I wanted this nick anyways though
6he's coconuts
6so yes
6 /oper nick pass
12why are you so curious?
12he's a hacker
/me hides
That should work from Roara.
6hax
6HAX
i has seen pix of drf & he r a guy
Obama is your new bicycle.
nexus one at&t going on ebay for $450... must buy...
that reminds me of "I am weasle, I R babbon"
The /oper command is a global command, and doesn't just apply to a single nick. Although, depending on the settings, it sometimes can only be used from a specific host.
12hmm
Did everyone run out of things to say?
6yep
/me 6runs
Oh dear.
6I'm actually sewing right now
6fixing a plush I made some time ago
12Aurora is an artist of doom
6doooooooooooooom~
I sincerely hope you find are able to find your way back to "out of things to say".
ffff your side puts mine to shame, Aurora
6bree
OTL
6you're a peadge
6Aero
6hush you twit
Tweet, twit~
;A;
Aurora, I have an amazing idea
let's only go for Aero with nerf guns at the meet.
>_>
<_<
oAO;
/me fleeeeees
This is relativity.
I'll uh.. hide behind my cellphone D:
or catch the bullets and Sebastianthrow them back at everyone :D

Which one?
03the internet?
Also I'm stuck :(

14Yeah my mum is stupid
14She has over 50GB of stuff drf >>
03just zip it up and email it to yourself or something
03oh
03so zip it up and upload it to a server
/me hides
14I made the mistake of teaching her torrenting
03LOLfail
ni ni going to bed
14Though I've stopped her now
14Saying that thepiratebay is dead lol
6LOL
D:
03heh
14But look I'm not backing my mums stuff up
14her laptop dies I lol
03so try Malwarebytes?
14Already have it
03and it doesn't work?
14found over 1600 malware
03LOL
Over 9000.
nah
under 9000\
1600 > 9000.
14This laptop has some nasty virus that nothing I know can detect
03oh, the one that's called "Windows"?
/me hides
03Not even Avira
03XD
03nah
03and wtf Avira
03that program is lame
14^
06It's always done the trick for me
03same with me and Malwarebytes
03but see
03us real pros just don't get viruses in the first place
14Avira is dangerous to windows
i use explorer.exe to detect virus
03I only ever use it on other people's machines LOL
if it crashes, it micro$not's fault
03I haven't gotten a virus in years
14drf, tell that to my mum LOOL
06xD
./me runn
14Aurora: No
Why
LOOOL oh god that thread is hilarious
6oh
Why is there a lemon
Why
Windows just isn't up to Linux's standard in general.
lol
i'm stuck too
14Whatever the virus is, it's kills the WGA.exe and makes all windows programs go bawwwwwww
03Linux is more hardcore, but Windows can do more
I've got 4 things missing
Typically, XP takes about 1 minute - 1 and a half minutes to start up, while Linux takes about 10 seconds.
not that 3Windows can do more but more programs are written for it
14OMG there you are stupidly wrong
me too
Windows does do more, and it's better for every day use.
6bawwwwwww lol
03my Windows boots up just as fast
061 and a half minute to start up? TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL
06I get less with it.
14I did have a windows comp that took under 10 seconds to load
03as Linux
Are they the one betweenthe book and trashcan
03takes like 45 seconds here probably
06I get it to boot up in some 20 seconds.
and the ones beside the paper
06Maybe 30 with my legacy machine.
and the one on the very top right?
Most XP computers take about a minute.
06Yeah, roughly.
14^wrong
03not the ones I run in a VM
There's some faster ones that take less.
03Those take about 10 seconds
06That's because they're in a VM.
03...
06Duh.
03the VM is going to have *less* power than my real computer dude
did u get the stuff inside the book?
03if I felt like installing XP on here
03it would boot up instantly XD
3OS info: Danny on Windows 7 Ultimate (Build #7600)

14WinXP has always been the fastest Boot up OS
Aha
found it
03Windows 7 is nice
06I dont trust any of the new ones past XP.
03it's better than Vistrash
14Win7 is nice
did u get the knife?
14but annoying
6 Win7 is crappier sometimes
and the paper with the colors on it?
06Hmm, I see.
Win7 is annoying
/me tries to escape Mr. Evil Scientist.
Yeah
03just takes some getting used toi
03-i
03I'm now a pro at it
14I'll stick to XP
I still prefer XP over the other Windows OSes, but it's not that bad.
ORLY nao, drf?
i am still missing two things now
03yarly
Me too
03sigh, stupid retainer
I still like Linux RedHat
03I should prolly wear it more
03EW RED HAT
03I like Ubuntu, but eh
Wooooooooooooooooo
03I still prefer Windows
03because I'm an A/V nerd
i cut the lemon...
so tell me, how do i make my start menu show the contsnts of my music folder directly, not show me folders of options?
03audio/video, not antivirus
It works nicely for me.
03why would you want to?
03I just have a shortcut to music
lol wow "hired chinese"
how racist can you get
03if it listed the contents directly it would take up about 27 screens XD
:O
did u cut the lemon?
No :(
/me used it on a book and numbers came up
How do I do it :(
you sidestepped the question/
click on the lemon
Ubuntu isn't too bad, though Fedora is worse.
/me is so close to looking up the answers. >>
03I dunno how to do that
like on the side part where it turns red
03I'm not saying I know how to do 100% of things
03but I know how to do as much stuff in 7 as I knew in XP
03only took mea few days
03+space
okay, got the lemon up
baw
u need the dragonball
drag the knife to it
RedHat is a nice Linux distro, and the server is pretty good as well.
:O
03I hate Red Hat
Is like magic
03the whole concept of them selling it
lol
now
06:S Selling Linux?
click on the book that says the life and times of whatever
06WTFBBQ
03yeah
03technically they're "selling support"< but you can't get RHEL for free
I like the actual concept but the selling part is silly.
03you have to pay a ton of money
*life and opinions
03like, more than Windows eVEN
03*even
$80 for the desktop version.
03for one year...
Yeah, I got the battery :D
yeps
RedHat as in the OS is good, but the selling idea isn't.
03I still prefer Ubuntu
03my university has Red Hat and it's kinda silly
06Ewwbuntu
06lol
Fedora is the free version of RedHat, but typically it's one of the worst Linux distros.
Stuck again
lol
03there's also Centos
06I'd prefer Lubuntu myself cause it runs much faster and has closed-source stuff in by default
Ubuntu is pretty useful.
Centos is bad. That's all.
06Unfortunately the Terminal doesnt work so well
i liek xubuntu
06i lik 2 tlk 2 da pplz
03I like just regular Ubuntu, 9.04
06You still have v9?
03the new ones suck
03Yes
0310.04 is terrible
06I got 10 myself, that explains a lot
03Stupid Mac OSX looking GUI, makes me want to hurt somebody
03and from what I can see there's really nothing new
I still have Linux RedHat 5.6, and that works pretty well.
03besides native iPod support and that's just plain silly
06Well Mac OS X is actually built on UNIX to be fair
03I know but I hate the GUI
0310.04's default GUI looks like OSX
03with the buttons on the left, to close and whatnot
03instad of the right
03*instead
06Yeah, it does actuallly
03it bugs me
03I like 9.04
06:S
i dont minde
03I tried 9.10 and it was stupid, so I went back to 9.04 LOL
Win7's GUI looks like Mac OSX's.
06Indeed
03no it doesn't
^QFT
03it looks nothing like it
06They ripped off OSX's Dock system
03it doesn't have a launcher, for one
03dock, w/e
03and wtf?
yes it does
03It doesn't have bouncing icons
03#1
06Lol
Rage
06Boing boing boing
What, with the rounded windows dialog boxes, large icons, and transparency?
03#2, programs are only there if they're open
03OSX they're *always* there
03OSX has no transparency
windows 7 moved into a /hybrid document-app ceentric approach with their ripoff dock taskbar thingy
06Transparency?
i'm stuck again
xD
lol
did u put it in the fire alarm?
:o did ya do it?
you dont need it
:O
03W7 still has the X-buttons on the right
its not productive
03which is nice
03not the left
03what dock thing
Okay, forget the transparency, but it looks a lot like Mac OSX.
03My 7 looks just like XP
but u still dont use classic
06You know what? My OS is the best.
06Mine fixed the oil spill.
06:P
oh
Didn't notice that
lol
06It can fix anything.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/junh1024/4826268816/sizes/l/ < my desktop
06And it worships the Necrowizard for you so you dont have to.
hmm
okay
03meh classic theme
and I moved the waste basket
03I like Aero, just not the giant icons
Now to get into that Safe
Linux is annoying to install though, but live CD fixes that
it takes up less screen space & ram than aero
03I have 8GB of RAM
03I don't care
:O
03http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/9775/capturegn.png <- my desktop
okayz
k
03looks a lot like XP/Vista to me...
03I see nothing resembling OSX in my setup.
what do u do with the waste basket?
It's actually quite fun. :o
You put it under the lamp
My school has the CMOS and BIOS settings passworded, so I can't dualboot or boot into Ubuntu or similar.
what h2g2 stuff do u hav drf?
:o i already did that
Is the lamp on?
03um
03don't remember, why?
OH
03I think I have the first 3 BBC series
the books
?
u put in the colors right?
Yeah
03also the BBC TV series and movie DVDs
u r copying h2g2 stuff in that shot
I got the lamp on and everything
lol
03o.o
I'm just stuck now
03oh yeah LOL
03not even sure what that is actually
03it was in My Documents somewhere
03it's probably the audiobook
03anyway
03I'm going to bed, it's almost 4AM...
i dont have the lamp on
oh
click the plug and it should go into the socket
then click the back of the lamp
there are shapes on the back of the books and on the inside of one
but about the diles
OH

02They've just met each other
02They can relate, but they're not exactly friends
02and Draconis is still pretty cold towards Tukh
/me shrugs
Tukh is somewhat insane
he believes friends are those on the battlefield that dont die
02XD
so yesh
I put CHAOS influnece there
plus he lived in a guilmon triber
*tribe
being an X-virus person, he was used for battles o3o

Wyvern; wait, I go after him?

02Special Abilities: Can use a variation of Garurumon's Howling Blaster attack. This attack, called Drawback Vortex WindstreamBlades, is a powerful wind attack where Seairyn-X opens his mouth and lets forth a stream of wind, which is 'sharpened' into a multitude of blades, and can damage enemies extensively. Seairyn-X rarely uses this attack, since it uses a lot of energy and can result in him falling unconscious.
02and that's drawback vortex windstreamblades
04it's also superultralongnameworld out here
02You should basically
02get Jesaan to stop everything
02and stop Key from fighting or something
02then basically we hear the battle
02the other battle
02between chronomon

7Hai.

how are you
7Slightly sleepy.
7Could you use proper capitalization?
why
whats wrong with not doing it
Hmmm?
What like this this better?
7It makes you seem like just another internet simpleton.
7And yes, Sky.
Ok
And...................................................................
7And periods. :3
Lol
7Puncuation in general, I suppose.
Quan can i do lol in nomal letters please
hey
7Well, yes.
Tank you
7And capitalize that I, add a period, and use commas properly.
Thank*
7Welcome.

LOL
10Better colour lol
7No, she is.
7Just not 'on' as in active.
7Please add periods to your sentences.
10Wait What
10Periods?
7Yes, the little dots at the end of sentences.
7Full stops, in British terms.
10!espeon.
/me now belongs to Sky|ChibiDesigner for 7 minutes
This is a period .
10Ha!
7Eh, script triggers don't necessitate a period.
7Sentences do.
10Oh man.
10I dont have to add periods if I don't want to.
7So you're content with capitals, but not periods?
10My dad just frazzled a wasp lol!
I'll just say my opinion and that is: As long as people don't txt spk I'm happy with it.
10!espeon
/me now belongs to Sky|ChibiDesigner for 14 minutes

12Banana Cream Pie Fat Free Yogert is too much of an insane idea
7Uh?
12i guess the randomness blew your mind as well
12its a gift
7Eh, I'm fine with it
7.
12i'm just trying to start conversation D:
7I'm not too focused on chat. X.x.
7-.
12very well
hai hai
are you on chat articuno
you see me
guess not lol
im random
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=entxRuZwaUY
7You seem to be forgetting capitalization and punctuation.
lol
7Eh, Sky doesn't seem to fail in that.
who likes this sig i made? http://a.imageshack.us/img683/1319/pokemonsigniturearticun.jpg
12guess not lol <--- is not a proper sentence
12has no noun
7Neither does that. ^
12better than anything i can do sky
7And Sky, that's rather large for a sig.
lol
it is the direct link
7And you saved it as a JPG...
7Are you going to learn or not? :/
everyone is complaing! stop complaining! please!
jpg has it's uses... but I'm yet to find them
/me hides
12what's the difference between jpg and jpeg
12besides one letter
7One's an abbreviation for another.
12i see
What Quan said. If you save/rename a jpeg as jpg it doesn't say "Renaming this might yada yada"
12Jpegs are good
12they aren't so much for quality but they are low memory so they load faster for webpages D:
...
oh...
but i like it
7It lowers quality, Sky.
7Unless you use high-quality JPGs. :P
and then you pretty much lose the memory-saving benefit
/me hides

12lol
12i read that as wtf
i do every time
12es
12Espeon do you have steam?
Why yes, I almost never play anything though xD
12either way
12i'm going to find it
12and add it *evil grin*
well hang on
or well I went on CS:S and got achievements vs bots yesterday. It cured a few hours of boredom
Espeon; you should create a game
about floof wars o3o
o-o
12i see
7o3o
7Steam, eh?
/me 7pokes Espeon with Eversion.
With what?
12hmm Espeon
12i'm having problems adding you
lol wut
12well i'm not getting an alert i added you
7Eversion.
7Steam game?
12and when i manually try to add you, it says it can't find your account
Accepted
Never heard of it Quan
/me accepts you
7Really?
7Fun game. :P
Yeah, but then again I went of steam for the first time in like a year yesterday
7It's, I think, five dollars on Steam.
7There's a free version, but it doesn't have achievements or time trials.
7And lower graphics.
12thanks Espeon
lolwut lower graphics on a trial
xD
7Can I recommend you play the game without seeing the video or achievements for it? :)
7(If you do at all?)
Doesn't look to interesting to me, but if I ever reach critical levels of boredom I'll give it priority :P
great, my key is acting silly
...
o key*
7Eh, you won't believe it.
I already looked up gameplay videos + info on it.
7Well, that basically ruins the point of the game.
lol how could I know
Hi
7Have you seen peoples' reactions toward it?
I've seen a bit, but I generally only play games that looks interesting to me. I know very well I will/ I am missing out on many good games, but it's just a habit
7Yep. I play unique games.
7Eversion, VVVVVV, recently refreshed on Windosill.
7Audiosurf, lol.
I'm not one of those people only playing mainstream games though, but I've had experiences where games have been ... bad but still people go "OMG ITS SO GOOD" just because it's unique. Audiosurf is a good one though, but I just don't play many games on PC.... over the last year++
7GUEST
Tails
7So your opinion on Eversion is...
I dunno, haven't played it. I just don't get that "I want to try this" feeling so I won't try it unless I naturally and individually decide to try it out.
7But I meant from what you've seen--those videos and the like.
/me will brb
It looks like a good time waster at least.
7Hmm, all right.
Heh
I like Audiosurf o.O
02Okay, I'm back. I just needed to comb my messy hair. XD
o3o
/me sits on Espeon

03LOL Ford
03Mercury is owned by Ford
7 200ish for some electric-based ones?
03...
03electric doesn't use miles per *gallon* at all
03it's *electric*
7That's why I said 'based'.
03hybrid?
03even those are only about 40MPG >_>

12O______o
12LMAO
12wtf?
12CLIENT EXITED LOL
lolhai Xai
o.o
lol wut
7:|
O___o
12Had enough?
lol wut ^ 2
Oh great
7How about a temporary ban?
...
O.O
What the hell?
:|
12This is more fun
lol Arti
a) retarded b) hacked c) has an unfunny friend over...
I can go on
7Hmm.
05retard comes to mind
shes not usually like this tho o.o
12I gave it like 30 seconds then banned
12If anyone figures out whether that's actually that person or not, let us know
/me sits between Tricky and Kitten
Xai
drf left lol
7Because foreign cars are popular?
:o
05didn't notice, lol
/me gives Xai its glasses? o3o
/me hides
05example - my car is like 7 years old and still gets over 50mpg with a 2l engine and a top speed of like 140 or so.
you can't write patrolling without trol- okay that's just a bad one Dx
07lol
07that doesn't sound accurate
07unless it's diesel o3o
05it is
7Hi, Alt.
Just heard something went on in here as well lol
7Yep.
12The usual, they swear, they die :3
Well Arti, if you saw what she did on HoR. It wouldn't be "just"...
Arti, at least she wasn't an oper :)
/me hides
05unless you wanted performance, why have a petrol/gas car?
07half the standard cars here are 2 liter engines that can't go much faster than 120 and don't get 50mpg
12LOL Espeon
added half of the people on my server to akill lol
basically banned everyone
7Egads, indeed.
12I read before, ROFL
http://comixed.com/2009/05/30/diesel-humor/
05exactly - i mean why don't they have them in the US?
xD
Anyway just checking in etc
12LOL AT PIC
07they do
07they're just more expensive and so is diesel gas
12Ok, why does no one buy them then? XD
12Wouldn't it make sense to buy an economic car then? :3
05But that is the funniest thing - when someone buys a 4-ton hummer and then gets it with a petrol engine for 'performance' - i mean seriously, why bother? it's like having an office block with a fan attached to the side that burns money for power.
07if it cost 150% more than a regular gas car, then yes lol
07and people don't buy those anymore o3o
05typically you get about 2 times the fuel efficiency so you save the enviroment and money too. win-win
12How much more expensive is Diesel over there by the way?
05oh and of course longer range so you have to fill up less
05and diesels are less expensive to maintain
07the cheapest diesel car is a vw jetta and costs 30k
hi
hi Xai
0530k??????
12Then why don't they sell Mondeos?
12ZS
you missed insanity o3o
07while a prius costs 22k
05wtf?
12*XD

derp
07that's expensive in the US
/me explodes.
05yeah that's what i mean it's not a cheap car
I WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE SEEEEEEEN.
12Yeh but buy it second hand and it is!
o.o
2nd hand ftw
05although i got it 2nd hand - i can't afford to buy new
12XD
12No one can afford to buy new cars Â¬Â¬
lol
12Unless they get loans
05except my mum
bill gates can :P
/me runs
07that's what people here do
12Yeh but she's also buying a house over half a million POUNDS
lol
12Loans, pff
:o
05yeah, cash too - no mortgage
there's no point buying a new car when you can get one slightly used and save several thousand
05sucks, i want a house
12We have a house :3 but it's not ours technically LOL
05i got mine for Â£3700 (new was Â£17,800) for 3 years old
12Andrew, RN bought a car on loan, a brand new one. She's still paying it back :(
oh god
07well duh o3o
Loans are bad
07it takes at least 5 years to pay off a car in full
12Totally depends on the price, interest and your wage :3
12It could be a year if you want
bleh
finance is just as bad
07it could, but few people have the money
12I wouldn't buy a car if I didn't have the money.
12Then again..
i know a guy that bought a fiesta which was just over 10 grand new, except he chose the finance option and ended up paying more like 15 grand over time
Kyu
12Kyu, thats what people do here LOL
a friggen fiesta
or biking
lol
12But I was about to say, public transport doesn't exist over there does it? LOL
07well the US is big
07public transport doesn't scale up well
12Yeh but driving through the whole of the US is like saying I'll drive through all of Europe
12You don't drive out your state/country much do you?
I would like to
sounds like an adventure
12You certainly don't get jobs outside your state unless you're on a border lol
12Or can afford to travel.
07and public transport is mainly local
12Sounds like here
people who drive pickup trucks must be compensating for something
12People commute, we just have transport to do it with :>
:P
o3o
12Andrew LOL yes.. ok
12Maybe their paycheck *runs*
07like I said, public transport isn't big here
05"Yes, i'd like a car that costs twice as much as a regular car, has much worse fuel economy, top speed and power, handling, also that i can't park easily and have to reach up 4 feet just to load the trunk and costs 3 times as much to service."
ha
05public transport has it's uses
07if you're taking a bus in SF, then you aren't going anywhere except within SF
07which is why everyone takes cars
12No one takes buses to get around the country here, it's train.
05i always think that an integrated system is best - it's not cost effective to have public transport to every hoime but likewise it's silly for people to sit in jams in the city
07since out of the dozens of cities surrounding SF, there's no public transport lines into the city
New York, New York...
12Train is generally long distance, buses short
07well the bay area has bart
12I wonder why they never built any proper transport links there
Yes, TV Tropes has an article on that. O_o
7And my color somehow asploded.
05the ideal system is where you get a car to a station and say a train into the center. easy parking, lots quicker and no stress (if it was an ideal world)
07but even then there aren't enough stops
like park n ride
07that is the bay area's system lol
05certainly not la's
12Im gonna go ^^
/me wants to learn to drive now XD
05ok, bye ra!
awww
12Â¬Â¬
bai Arti~
7Bye, Arti?
05:D
7I drew an Artifox.
07the bay has the best train system in the US since it isn't as crowded or complicated
and goid luck~

You couldn't imagine how much hate was pouring into the car from people on their porches staring at us as we drove by
Not much
sometimes nothing is better
It's the same feeling when you're inside and it's like 70 F / 20 C in your house, and you step outside into 100 F / 36 C weather -- it's that same feeling, almost like getting hit with a shockwave
i for one look forward to a nice easy day of little to no significance
kinda hard with all the new pokemon from gen 5 that have been announced
blech
another generation
lol
you poor thing
there was a sudden boom of info yesterday i guess
and today
/me was brave enough to take exactly one picture
they should have stopped at 2 or 3
but well well, the internet itself advertises Pokemon for free if they just give a little info (as in Zorua+Zoroark)
Yes. lolol
4 sucked
03I liked 3
03RSE was the best games
that's quite an original opinion
sup drf, yes 3rd/1st gen were my faves
and 5, I am sorry, you hav a flippen clown for a starter
and not even a stealthy one
sorry, move on
i'm still going to play gen 5 for completion sake
bleh, I wouldn't
I have not touched a 4th gen
not even for SS or HG
:#

No matter how much people complain they still buy them. And yes
@ Espeon true

just trying to have a lazy sunday i suppose
okies
No.
Not at all =P
It's a cool song :3
decent is pushing it
i can't say that i like too many of the new pokemon
I'm not getting the new games. ^^;Â¨
Neh
like, pushing it with the force of a nuclear blast
I like the pigeon one
i like the new grass starter and then i also like zekrom that's about it
oh and Zorua was kinda cool
sorry, I like my original fox better, Ninetails
That girl in the you dun goofed video is kind of cute -- I can't believe she's not like 18 or 19
i just don't want to get to the point where we have like 10 versions of a species in this case foxes
Or at least 16
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbPuTwo1bxs
well, we have bout 10 in birds :P
Very well-made music video.
Zorua is okay, but Vulpix and Eevee beats it ever day |3
or more
if you said fox pokemon originally ppl would know what you were talking about
and yesh
now they ask which gen
make new species Nintendo instead of more of the same
and i agree there are WAY too many birds now
ummm
the next gen alone introduces about 5
lol
That girl who you said "no, she's definitely 11" and I'm like "well, she LOOKS like she's 16-19"
SO FAR
we've yet to see the entire pokedex for 5th gen
I have been done since gen 3
the girl with the crazy dad? o.O
Yeah
in the world of money there is no "retiring when you're at the top"
you think that bratty crazy chick is cute?
well Eeveelutions
|3
Well...... she's cute if you turn off the sound
the infamous 59 error
yes
And pretend she's at least 16
i've never really seen it in game tho
yeah, she has an adorable voice if you just don't listen to it :3
whatever floats ur boat
i guess it takes hacking/cheating ?
I have, after running a magnet over it :p
ruined the game though
yay for glitches that can't be abused and are just funny
missingno is worse
I love Missingno
tho 'm is even worse than Missingno
Archimedes' Principle makes my boat float
inf nuggets
^-^
suddenly money
yes
but why is 5th gen purposely using the #000 slot ?
for a pokemon
because nintendo no longer cares
it would be more lulzy if you could do it like before doing the first gym. That would be silly, breezing through with rare candy leveld Pokemans
lol
connection perhaps, maybe it was planned all along ?
either that or they're doing it to prevent any glitch abuse
i'm sure they no longer store the player's name in the pokemon data, that was just a bad idea to begin with
yeah
but thy should stop
Yes'm
Many of those glitches really makes them look like lazy programmers
..And wait, wasn't the Archimedes principle about the water screw or something?
I loved missingno
pretty good vid
even as late as gen iv we still have bad glitches
like yeah... storing temporary data in weird places
and movie
invisible shiny bulbasaur anyone ?
Never seen the movie.
Archimedes' principle is basically the physics behind buoyancy
lol
Ah.
"Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid."
i've seen it in game through code use
and "Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."
Thus, that's what floats my boat
so Gen V is probably going to have it's own share of glitches
interesting
/me nods
It's physics ^_^
what would be truly bad would be if they somehow restored missingo, tho i'm still all for the idea of making the official glitch type pokemon
maybe something involving porygon ?
/me was thinking of the Archimedes screw. :o
I just want them to stop
corruption perhaps ?
g2g
k
BBL~
bye LL
You got gravity all like "IMMA KEEP YOU DOWN RAWRAWRRAWR"
And then buoyancy is all like "I'm never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down"
come on corruption of porygon would atleast be kind of a cool concept
yeah
but they should just stop making the series
and having a safe glitch-type version would be a wonderful homage to gen 1
lol corruption of Porygon
irl virus pokemon anyone?
Nintendo told ppl not to go after missingno but this just made ppl more intrigued
It also has a bit of the third law of physics in there two
yeah
i remember seeking out missingo when Nintendo put the warning up
Newton's third?
bye!
is bad egg officially a used bit of coding to prevent hacking/cheating ?
yes
i've always wondered if gamefreak/nintendo put that in on purpose
considering it's been in every gen except gen 1 (R/B/Y) that was good evidence for
ah ok i see now so it really is an anti-cheat programming
Yeah
Yellow had no missingno
That one :3
yes it did
/me noms on physics
RBG did
Pokemon Yellow had yellow missingo
yellow was spared the programming
http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingo#Yellow_Version_form
Yellow Amarillo is an awesome chracter
yes
missingo is in yellow
missingno*
Green, she's awesome
sorry i typed that way too fast my bad
but she never was in the games =(
it's ok, I type fast too
i ruined my blue version catching too many missingno
it says the game data has been destroyed and can't be used :(
D:
that sucks
so yes i've come face to face with one of the most severe error codes there is
o-O
well, at least it displayed that error code correctly
/me hides
hmm apparently yellow missingno is WAY MORE DANGEROUS
behold the horror that is yellow missingno http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/3/3e/000Y.png
we will not survive
Uh
/me kabooms
I died
I lovd Green <3
Green is epic :D
she actually kind of looks like me irl
x3
but with shorter hair
cute
awws
I'm really not that cute ^^;;
I had a crush on green for a long while while and after reading the comics
x3
I looovee those comics
it's my Ravers Fantasy
/me is SHOT
yesh
Fluid physics always escaped me
ok got it glitch talk over my bad
you pulled dah trigger? D:
/me 7is back.
hi Quan
Never had the dedication to try and wrap my head around how and why stuff floats :p
sorry i get carried away when it comes to discussing glitch pokemon
it's alright
yeah
we all have our clicks
7Hmm.
/me 7awaits Aurora.
7!generate 1 2
1
like how I love Latias' for having so many forms and cute looks
7Science it is!
Latias is cool
:3
Latias has a decent amount of forms i suppose
she is like a ditto
yup
just not gooey
03except Dittos are pimps
/me runs
yup
lol
lol drf got that right
a pimp ditto
XD
kinda pathetic but until my friend told me yesterday i didn't know mew could transform
O.O
oh wow
XD
lol Mew ftw
Ditto is the pimp's dream.
that simple
Shiny Mew is ftw
yes Espeon
which would mean ditto is the closest to mew then ?
that it is
and maybe
Ditto should secretly evolve into Mew >:D
lol
I wonder... what happens in that daycare
03bbl
things that we're obviously not supposed to know
XD
bye drf~
lol
Whoever sees what happens in daycare is picked up in a black van and never seen again.
so yeah the daycare man is blind
ROFL
that explains a lot
i wonder if legends will ever breed
probably not
Fluids are strange
they do. But it doesn't work.
=O
well
they don't on the game for a reason
super powerful pokemon.....
maintain rarity ?
and that too
yeah, like people don't just pokesav them
/me dies
that still shouldn't prevent younger versions of the legends idk
07!espeon
/me now belongs to Kyu for 11 minutes
?
A nest full of Lugia
cute
/me is the smallest floofburd in the bunch
^^
12I just had half a driving lesson LOL...
o-o
7Hi, Arti.
half a driving lesson? o.o
and hi o3o
hey sup Articuno :)
12Hi :>
.. lol
12Well we're on Google maps looking for roads that might be quiet
13 15:41 Espeon A nest full of Lugia < Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
13hey Arty
13try the bonies
13there always quiet
13boonies*
13there much better
Why are people calling her Arty LOL
:o
7I don't.
13umm Mostly I'm the one that does that
13XD
12Arty used to be my nickname
well Arti does sounds like Arty
12Used by just one person but he was a regular so people saw it all the time
but I pronouce it "Art-ih" though
like "Art-ih-cuno"
xD
well, that's how I pronouce Articuno
12In England we say Aaar Ti
yeah
10hey a person i seem to know
=D
10>=3
:)
10RAPE FACE
13Artinorth?
ahhhhhhhhh
i dunno ..i havent seen any of them all day
?
10WAHH
10well im going off.
10to take a crap
awwwwww lol
07lol
7Yeep.
tvtropes is win
i could read articles on there all day
I'll just say what I always say: That I don't see the appeal of that site.
And then just poof
7You do click on the links, right?
i clicked the link
7Well, links to other pages in TV TRopes.
I've tried, but it just leaves me thinking "Why the hell am I wasting my time on something I don't find funny, interesting or anything?" and then I close the window :3
7Tropes*
7The tropes themselves, Espy?
7Omegle is funtimes
I guess I just don't find the ... I dunno, layout/presentation, humor... anything over there appealing o3o
7I find the layout very useful. :P
7You can disguise it as actual data. >>
well, I just wanted to state my opinion and poof o3o
back
wb
does anyone here enjoy tvtropes for the actual tropes ?
i find them highly interesting
7TV Tropes is HUGE.
it's cool being able to look up almost any concept used in a show you want and find other shows that use it
and how they use it
7I'd say stick it in scraps.
13brb shower
/me 7nods.
7TVTropesWillEnhanceYourLife, indeed.
7I've managed to stick Egregious into my vocabulary.
that or waste your life away xD
7Meh, the former.
7Except that EVERY 'dramatic' moment in media is now narmy.
Tricky!
:D
You got any plans for somewhere else to plgrimagitise to?
/me shakes his head
Aw :(
Well, if you do end up going somewhere else, I'd be interested to hear about it :D
slow day on TST it would seem
7Not quite.
7We had... activity earlier.
i suppose
but now we've kinda hit a dead point in the day
Thanks :D
7Yes, currently is.
7I'm gonna work on Floofspeon.
Wat was I tabbed for? :o
/me 7pokes Espeon
/me 7pokes Espeon
!random
o.o
OH
7Hey.
Hey
7For your sprite, you have a :3 face.
7Is that fine with you?
... YES
xD
that's win
7And I'm wondering whether to floof your ears or not.
7They sorta look like pine cones.
o3o
tail needs to be sorta fuzzy, not too floofy. floof is for chests, fuzz for the rest
/me hides
7http://uploads.mibbit.com/MwCpOl.png <-- Well, that's what I have so far. (Sprite dump, left corner.
FFFFFFFf <3
ears seems to possibly come better off without the fluffiness o3o
7'kay, Espy.
/me 7deletes.
oh that's cool i didn't know mibbit did uploads
is it like temp storage or something ?
just make them a bit thicker than usual, or just normal x3
ok ignored that's fine
7Eh, Art.
permanent or not ?
7I'dn't think so, as pastebin entries disappear after time.
sooner or later they tend to magically 404
ah
7http://uploads.mibbit.com/XaqTVu.png <-- Better?
oh YES :3
7Yay. :D
7Onto the colors.
7But first, painting. o.O
gonna go, bye all
7Bye!
7D :
7O.o
7Blas you, paintbrush in one hand, keyboard under another.
oo
7My painting, you mean>
7?*
yea
7An eagle and owl.
7It was originally gonna be one or the other, but...
cool
what happened ?
7I drew both.
what inspired that change
?*
7I took a third option instead of one or the other.
ah ok
Lol, I got banned?
Lol.
Hey RDX.
HIYA
oops all caps
where you been
long story short, something weird happened
We went to France - the Normandy area.
either someone went apeshit or that person got hacked
So how are you?
ahhh
been busy
oh wow articuno accept my facebook friend req :)
accepted*
i should feel pretty lucky right
Oh, ok. O_o
7Well, Arti's just a normal person.
i've rarely been able to befriend the owner of sites before tho
lol facebook
google is apparently coming out with their own competitor for facebook
google me is what it might be called
and back to the whole facebook thing ppl post personal stuff on their facebooks that they don't want just anyone seeing
Thanks
so it's a real sign of trust/friendship
and wb
err right *pulls hand back* oh well
Oh
Hi
For some reason I thought you were talking to someone else
hey how's it going
It's going fine, you?
err you're the only person here i've yet to meet, fine too i suppose just abit bored
!lag
good night everyone
good night all
nini :3
7Priv?
priviledge* meh how ever it's spelled
i always shorten it to priv
7Yeah, but privilege?
/me prods Sneas :<
7If you mean Espeon's gift, it's the other way around.
/me pokes Espeon o3o
7I give art as gifts, rewards, and the like. My opinion, basically.
7If other people want me to draw something, I let them go through a small trial.
o.o
04morning
how much do you charge for a completed project?
o.o
and hihi Drake :3
what sprites can you do
04hi Espeon
hey Drake
04hey Altair
:3
04?
7Well, first:
7I don't charge for sprites; I give them if I think the request-er is worthy.
i meant that sprite contest a few days/weeks? back
04ohthat
worthy oh wow xD well i'm screwed
it's a refined way of saying that she makes them if she feels like it I guess
7Lol.
7The sprite contest was, well, a contest.
7Whoever won could get a sprite--a greater one than I normally do.
7 Aero's request was a bit difficult, but I tried.
7Speaking of, how's your side coming, Lyon?
hello
to all
!op
7Espeon, is it okay if I gave your sprite big ol' chibi eyes?
!hop
as long as you keep the floof and the general :3 of it
or well, mostly the floof
silly furball Espeon
7Maybe I should just draw dot eyes.
7Since :3 has dots.
bbl
well I can't see chibi eyes becoming too big with that limited space, I just don't like super huge KAWAII DESU eyes too much. Dot eyes = comic relief though x3
7Well, dot eyes:
Hi Shahrukh

plz proceed here
cool quan
guyzzz
HAHA
that's so silly, in a good way x3
!espeon
/me now belongs to Sky|ChibiDesigner for 1 minute
7I could have two versions, one with dot eyes and one with chibi ones.
I really can't decide, so it would either be that or you do what you think would be best
quan do chibi eyes they are so cute
chibi eyes are okay as long as they're not overdone :P
if the fan art page is fixed by cristmas i will be doing a big suprise!
but i will ask arty though
lol
brb
but i will be doing a big suprise
with help
/me yawns
right i PM arty and told her
!espeon

04i still have 11 people in my steam friend list that haven't accepted my invitation lol
Shahrukh, please stop advertising your channel here.
lol
o_o;
hi
and lol
I don't even have steam on this computer
I never use it
04lol
04you were one of the people i added as a friend
yeah.. I don't even have it :/
04basically i went on a friend adding spree and using those friends to find other friends
04and so on
I see
04i figured Youhr was you
lol
7Floofy Espeon is floofy.
I knooooow |3
7Eh, you should see it. X3
7I added TEXTURE. o3o
oh my
04that i wasn't aware of
?
whats that?
/me likes catfish now :3
04http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025746384
04check my gameplay stats
I don't get it
04i played Alien Swarm for about 3-4 hours
04does that help?
7Eh, I can't get that meme 'It's so fluffy' out of my head as I'm drawing you. X.x
weird
04when i closed Alien Swarm
04for some reason a process it was running didn't
that sounds promising
04so steam thought the game was still running and that i was playing the game even though it wasn't open
04so now my playtime for alien swarm is 28 hours XD
LOL, that's the best game achievement ever. Tie up a female NPC, then put her on the train tracks, and watch her get squished.
lol Dastardly
Red Dead Redemption
8D
Yep, I'm working on doing all the achievements now. :)
Drawing who, Quan?
lol
many are online ones that you need up to 8 people for or something so
I finally got all the COD ones, special ops were pretty hard. O_o
I didn't find them too hard in fact. In fact some of the "easier" ones proved hard n.n
Meh, I'll just do the single player ones then, I don't think much of the multiplayer.
lol
I hated the juggernauts in Favela.
thumper headshot is your friend. Or RUN FAST AND SPAM STUFF for that matter
7Espeon, Aero.
The one I found hardest was Snatch and Grab though.
The one in scrapyard.
You're drawing Espeon as an Espeon, right? XP
that one was indeed hard. the end where you jump out of the broken plane... ALWAYS someone survived my sniping there and shot me in the back
oh, Quan
Yeah.
I wish I had a scanner, I just finished drawing Orexa
7Ah.
7And yes, Aero.
she turned out good, too
How many IW times did you break? I only got one. XD
my favourite use of MW2 nowadays is tracking down those kids with high-pitched voices and make them mad 8D
Hahaha.
I'm in kind of a KH fanism X3
easy to do when you're trash to them unless you "quickscope" though.
I've gotten all sorts of threats. Sad really.
I like to piss off all the cocky retards. XD
Oh, well.
7Lol.
7Wait, did you finish TLS?
Yeah. In general those who take it FAR to seriously = best targets for lulz
BRB, starting up my console (My monitor is also my console TV).
pretty much lol
xD
naw
XD
I should favorite the link though
/me wants proper apple juice
None of this squash crap
I just have been RPing as Orexa a lot
?
04is Red Dead Redemption that good?
o_o
7O.o
7Where?
with my friend in a PM
you know.
I PM RP a lot
diluting juice?
fruit squash?
oo
7Who?
Well I like it, the story lasts longer than most games do (with my excessive playing XD), but the traveling around can sometimes get a bit boring.
Huge map.
04i see
04i'm usually not a fan of western style anything
I wish I'd worked out you can travel from a camp to any waypoint you set earlier in the game. XD
yea I think I get you
04not to mention it was by rockstar who made GTA which once again wasn't that good
J
7Ah.
7How do the RPs go?
yeah, he's a good RPer

Ah.
Tofu casserole is not as good tasting as it sounds.
12lol
sounds disguisting
7I always found it odd Cynder was weak to Earth. it just makes no sense within the context. as a game, it makes sense because it's the last element left. but that doesn't make it any less stupid
</random>

minus the one hit KO
ROFL!

/me runs
dat's mean D:
dat's punchin
12I know
Gaul i only died 2 times facing him
12anyway
Wouldn't slapping someone with your fist be a rather ineffectual punch? :P
/me was cicked by cobe (FACON PUNCH!)
it'd be like almosta fist bump
XD
12that makes no sense lol
:D
Falco Punch!

\o/
/me runs
XD
maybe
/me returns with another salad
/me 7sighs.
eww salad.
unless it's honey and mustard chicken pasta salad.
7I lol'd when I saw 'Cartright' as a name mentioned in the book Rebecca. O.o
Now THAT'S awesome.
Just lettuce and a bit of ranch
O.o
I remember being in hospital once when they moved 24 of us to a new ward.
That had no working cooker.
who's Rebecca?
So we had to like eat salads for a week.
7The previous owner of Manderly.
:(
I ate half a boiled egg, every day, for a week.
That was IT.
ok
:(
They wouldn't even send down sandwiches.
:(
Not that I would've eaten them, their sandwiches were foul, but it would've been nice to have a choice.
haha
oh, the trials and tribulations of Kumi's experience in psychiatry.
:(
hey, it'll be a year this September since I've been inside.
Hi. xD
03Hi :3
Hullo o3o
Oh hi
/me hides
xD
XDD
What happened anyway o.o
03????????
I have freakin' no idea why that happened
and how they got a hold of my passwords n' crap
03You was there when it happened o.o
the only thing I can think of
is that someone somehow got them from pastebin
from when NS was helping me with scripts
Ugh D:
but those were all set to disappear within like 10 minutes or whatever
03or some 1337 h4x0r.
yeah.
that guy was certainly not leet
I dunno.
it pisses me off.
a lot. xD
first thing he did was issue a ton of help commands LOL
lawlwat XD
He does /os help
then /os mode and types something in wrong
hm. o.o
But oh well, I happened to return in the act so yeah nothing too terrible happened
I just feel terrible about it :/
that it was all done in my name and <censored>
No worries, it's not something you can really see coming
/me wonders who zinc was and crap
Yeah. ._.
Oh well, at least it was only some idiot with a vague idea of how to use a computer, would have been bad if he'd been awesomsauce.
/me has zinc's street address. :3
/me hides
if you really do, look it up on google maps
If you do, send it to 4chan. XD
4chan wouldn't do anything lol
03LOL
/me will send it to Assrapechan
haha XD
and yeah
I'm just disturbed how he found out my information...
if you do post it
you should say "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T USE PROXY"
LOL
Send it 888chan then, they would. :o
brb testing to see if scripts work
he's quite an idiot for not using some kind of mask
wheee
/me sends IP to cyberpolice :O
Does the network block tor?
woo 8D
Because onion skins suck.
03888chan is currently back as a read-only archive. It will not come back as an active chan until such a time as it can be fully supported financially as well as properly protected from DDoS attacks. The best defense is a strong offense IMO.
/me :<
888chan is dead?
03For now o.o

Curly: On Windoes?
Ooh reminds me

apparently my log files are unnaccessible
:(
You went through preferences, logging, show log files?
I copy pasted my old logs from linux into the log folder
Ah
brb
bye
I'm probably going to be doing a lot more quitting and joining >_>
lol
I'll help as best I can
that's weird
the folder won't let me uncheck read only
I uncheck it and it just rechecks it every time I hit okay
:(
can anyone tell me what's wrong with the banlist in #xyzzy?
oh ew D:
notepad scrambled all my txt files -_-
/me beats it with a rock
what's it doing Raccoon?
brb >_>
thanks
wb Curly :)
was checking if someone was on steam
thanks again
keep missing him and he is my primary partner in l4d
so it sucks he is not around lol

Raccoon, no. XD

Twice as much happens.
Hehe, Curly caught it
caught what? <_<
xyzzy :3
I caught it too. :o
/me doesn't know what you mean by "caught"
/me gives Curly a late greeting.
hey ^^

/me keeps fiddling with xchat's colours

/me is eating up 40 KB of memory every 10 seconds on each server.
Umm
No you're not
er wait
20 KB
Raccoon, the ban list is the same.
the same?
I can't see any bans being set on #xyzzy.
in the channel window?
Nope.
i see them scrolling by rather quickly
unless old bans are falling off the stack
but i can't tell because the list is too large for a non-oper to view
Memory on all servers is staying constant
/me peeks in after being gone for 11 months.
:o
wb Curly ^^
:o
Yeah, that /check command
thanks :)
and yay! no more system beep
You're very welcome :)
:D
/me is Away (Reason:Auto IdleAway after 15 minute(s)) (Since:) (Pager:on) (Logger:on) - Invincible
Is Shayman the default now
I'm on shatmin
shay*
shay*
shay*
-_-
Awww, well, the channel's broked now
:(
/me just closes it
Close what?
/me blinks
:/
Yay, activity!
:o
If you want to test bugs, download and install an IRCd, don't use a production network
:/
That's like the first rule of quality assurance / network security consulting
/me figured this network would serve as a quality test network
hi J
/me shakes his head
/me points to the production sticker on the window :3
now to unban them all :)
there's a clear banlist command I'm pretty sure
oooh
hi Aero
where where!
umm isn't it just /clearban
sexy
Come on
that worked :)
/me facepalms
What is going on
Was that intentional?
it was not successful
For what channel
/me has a script
#xyzzy
you may have ops
:)
wb
HOW MANY BANS DID YOU SET
a few 10 thousand
Well there is the problem with the script
um, not likely
I overloaded
the server was unwilling to send 12 megs worth of banlist to you
Why...
because it's 12 megs
No
Why did you ban 10 thousand innocent people
lol
ha
aw, thats so mean
he didn't ban 10 thousand people
/me is confused
he just spammed the banlist with random characters
Another using this as a test network?
the maze of twistly little passages had a cave in. :(
What exactly were you testing
Hmm
PROTO
:D
at first i wanted to see how many bans you could set per MODE
then how large the ban masks could be made
Aah
then it turned into figure out the size of the banlist and propogation
i learned that only the first 101 bans propogate between servers
after that, a channel becomes desynchronized
so, if you want to prevent someone on another server from banning you. fill the banlist with 101 bans first
then their bans wont leave their local server
sort of bugs that were fixed way back in Hybrid 5
not sure what branch this codebase comes from
That's a pretty good way to get banned off a network
just checking the tires.
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate you for wanting to help, but I don't want you exploiting bugs on here. Why can't you download and install a test server to try that on?
that would take time away from actually finding bugs :p
then it becomes work
Try it on Freenode...I dont liek them
xD
they're pretty matured right now
and they switched to a different codebase that appears quite stable
Or ChatSpike xD
/me considers ChatSpike to be a test network
But you wouldent let #UESPWiki come over here
Would you?
Raccoon I havent seen any here
?
I would like all my channels on this server
Raccoon: But you'll actually get something done if you test bugs out on the ChatSpike servers :3
Right
Lol
/me just found out he knows an InspIRCd developer. :o
I met Brain on ECNet. :o
Dr. Brain?
Raccoon, ChatSpike.
I KNOW but sacrificed must be made.
sacrifices*
>_>
who is Brain
only one I know is the CS one :X
codes for CS?
ChatSpike
doh
Yep
XD
Thats a server name no relation
Not my server.
\o/
Yay, Raccoon will get to have fun, and have a nice testing server that no one cares about \o/
Everyone's happy :D
/me does not like that network :x
yea we know Ari xD
XD
I haven't.
lol oh gawrsh
Raccoon, if you do try it on CS, do tell me how it goes.
Raccoon: They'd be mildly inconvenienced, probably, if they noticed
Raccoon I'm on there now
I really wanna see you do it
xD
#xyzzy
Lol he's doing it
Ari, jon the fun
:O
I'm gonna proxy in
/me can do that
Oh deal
dear*
Don't associate this network with it, please
>.>
I'm not going to
Raccoon, you too
/me too.
..
Which means I should probably pick a different alias.
But yeah, that's how to grayhat :3
lol
You gotta go for the flagship network, no one cares about Epic Chat, we're nobody
:P
it's OK if it's someone else's network :>
Well, no
Exactly
But it's okay if it's CS
how many of you are using mIRC?
you can help
Or Freenode
I am
/me isn't.
But I can program a C++ bot if need me.
be*
HA
/me watches
wb Curly :)
thanks. again x_x
and I think I'm banned on one of my networks for joining too much >_>
/me 13hugs
D:
:o
:(
hi
My god man
6 bans a second, it looks like.
$len(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789[]{}`^\|_-123456789[]{}`^\|_-123456789[]{}`^\|_-
oops
btw, it should be 10 bans a second.
:o
/me is using irssi
bah...slept again
...
Note to self.
Shift-Click = Close.
xD
haha
x3
anyone who wants to help. you need to add this to your aliases section.
ALIAS rstr { ; Raccoon 2008-APR.v3_2010
var %x = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789[]{}`^\|_-123456789[]{}`^\|_-123456789[]{}`^\|_-`^\|_-`^\|_-
}
then, when you are ready to begin, i'll op you in the chan
you would type this command on ChatSpike
/timer 0 1 mode #xyzzy +bb $rstr(250) $rstr(250)
... are you still flooding bans?
To ChatSpike
:D
oh
well no thanks >_>
that's one of my main networks :X
!sneas
:3
I can't stop you from doing whatever you want to do on ChatSpike, but I would prefer if you used a channel off the network to coordinate it
/me feels reaaaaaaaally uncomfortable about having coordination discussion on here
Also!
I'd try out that script, but I always failed at it
/me has a funny picture he found on Facebook
bah, slept again

It must be
*watched
Even I've heard of it before
Then the other was XXY about a hermaphrodite, which I saw part of, specifically the bit where she gave some other boy anal. O_o
ive never heard of it
Well, Pan's Labyrinth is a name older than the movie.
o_O wow
Dari: Augh.
what were you watching again dari?

Dari: They pay ME to be a student!
Lol.
150%, no less. xD
lol at amazon's textbook threads
Lol, I have Chrome OS, Ubuntu, and Windows 7 running. :o
Dari: What's your stance on Amoeba?
apperently there was a post about beating someone to death with a book instead of selling it back to teh textbook buyback thing, and amazon removed it cause the title felt threatening, so they started another thread naming it is it alright to nudge them into death valley with it
You can't taste them.
So they suck.
Nah, the OS. xD
Maybe I'll wake up to one in the morning
amoeba?
Never heard of it.

if I sing to you, it'd be in different language. Maybe italian
12I hate it when mIRC does that!
Bella ciao bella ciao beela ciao ciao ciao
It's afraid of your boisterous personality, and is hiding.
12Wish I could actually speak Italian Â¬Â¬
10OH FUU-
o3o learn?
man i hate those apes at the malefor mountain
Â¬Â¬
lol blast em with electricity
I looooooooooooooooooooove that
Arti, mIRC does that if you just highlight a line ;P
it's useful when you try to actually copy a line
Anyway
as it removes color codes
thats mainly what i use there
12I couldn't dedicate any time to learn a language now, especially sicne I'm very bad at learning other languages
i also hate the ogres
o/
with the swords
Arrow is dragging me off
I shall be IDLE
o3o
^^ ilu chat
/me poof
.... they just straight up suck
12DRF I know it does that, you can't copy paste any other way
yes you can
ctrl+C LOL
10shhh.....
10shhh.......
that keeps colors, whereas just highlighting removes them
10be quiet
12How when you let go and the highlight goes off?
think they're hard wait until your 1st try against gaul
10here video
10here stupid video
highlight and press ctrl+C at the same time
10get ova here....
Cyndi: I was about to remark on how quiet you were being.
12I don't even bother
Articuno; o3o easiest way to get 'familar' with some tones or sounds is to listen to songs

12Well too bad it's in London
http://mibupload.com/LIfy7x.gif
yeh
She'll be back....
In....
those ogre guys are cheap
3...
2...
1...
FUCK!
LOL @ timing
we're talking about London in another channel
everything in eternal night is cheap lol
how crappy it is?
my least favorite wii game
12Well that part isn't bad
12It's central London, near trafalgar sq
I was there
well actually I tell a lie I went there on a college trip and it was actually a great city entertainment and culture/history wise
Trafalgar Square... is that the place with the big billboards?
It was like a dlc...
for like JVC and stuff?
If you will...
hamleys was brilliant! :)
12No thats picadilly
played dotd 1st then eternal night then i played anb and went wtf lazy developers on eternal night
oh
what's in Trafalgar?
I swear the name is familiar
only thing new those dogs ....
12A square with fountains and peadge
12s
...
any shops or anything?
also :D
12No
which they scared them all away from :\
I'm celebrating
#PM is officially dead
:D
also yeah theres a tokyotoys thing in picadilly
12why?
12Why's it dead?
12Not that I care but Im just curious
apparently they got mad about someone torrenting their encodes
and got p*ssy about copyrights
my tutor said they used hawks or something
so they decided to just shut it down
In the ds version, there were saber-toothed like tiger thingys...
they password protected the channel and shut off all their bots
oh wait thought you meant about me
they've been kinda messed up for the past while anyway, like they wouldn't let you download their stuff unless you're serving files yourself
I think the gba version was the most original one, and most fun...
i hate the dogs
i just freeze em and melee them
Wait... why do I have so many eternal nights?
12LOL NIck
Is that the script?
glutton for punishment
lol
yay the assassin again
*rolls eyes
KJ, hey hey.
7... what?
... burn em in dragon time then run
what?
7cool
12That you thought I was asking you LOL
I'm kidding...
/me throws wood pigeons at Arti
7I stopped caring when people showed me their 'works of art' a long time ago and just defaulted to 'cool'
It's not even mine, it was a joke.
7^see above^
Well, perhaps you'll find this one a bit more accurate: http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/troll.gif?t=1280951881
7am I the only one who doesn't know who that Cyndi person is?
CYNDI!
I didn't until today. Assumed you were familiar...
oh btw you have your pics vids of teh airshow?
7there are far too many idiotic children associated with Spyro
10hello
7Icy, don't
Cyndi: http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk263/A_Grim_Reminder/troll.gif?t=1280951881
Hi.
10........
10uhh
10whut
uh oh
10uh oh whut?
10mmm bacon
7huh. different hostnames.
10HAHA IM HABING BACON RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANT HAVE ANY NAH NAH
Cyndi: Please?
10uhh
12Going out now
7seriously. who the fuck is this Cyndi person?
10who the fuck are you eh?
xD
10i'll tell you
10im meeee
Tough, huh?
7FAR more intelligent than you
10ehh
/me grabs popcorn
10*eye roll* cant be bovvered with this today
10cuz im having some bacon.
Are we bovvering you?
10oh yeas
10so anyone here want some bacon?
7oh good god it's like a real version of Catherine Tate
10.......
Define 'real.'
10lolwhut
7touchÃ©
10oh good insulting a person you've only met for like 5 seconds#
Insulting strangers is the most sincere form.
:(
She'll be back.
7indeed. If you insult a stranger your insults ring truer as they're not tainted by previous experience
Bingo.
Although ironically people take it less personal if the insult comes from a stranger, yet it's probably the most accurate.
7god I hate mibbit
ugh i ded
*died
What killed you?
those little apes
7abject stupidity?
they swarmed me
spam em with electric orbs
i'm gonna darkspyro their butts
Voltorbs will not help you here.
then melee em back and forth
No, is it a comic?
7?
i darkspyroed their butts
haha
7no, an FF. But at the very peak of FFs. The basic premise is "uuuh, what would happen if PokÃ©mon became lethal? that would be AWESOME."
apes suck
this is why humans are superio
7but it kicks all six kinds of ass
*superior
7humans are superior because, theoretically *cough*, we're more intelligent and sapient
7I can go grab you a link
yeah and apes aren't
hence them getting beaten by spyro
7it's currently in the third book
*or for some
i hate apes
Sure, give me that link.
7It annoys me when people refer to sapience as sentience
lol sparx
7ooh yay. one sec
7there we go
sparx is so weird
Curses, I have to get off for a short while.
7ok
yay gaul
7I'll go grab the link quicksies
I'll get the link after.
Okay, or now.
i'm on the gaul boss fight
i wish he didn't take away spyro's mana
I never understood why they did that.
another way to po the gamer
i also don't get why gaul hates spyro
7eh. he's gone already
and why he kidnapped cynde
*cynder
if he hates dragons
why'd he take one
7he doesn't hate dragons. he works for Malefor.
needed 1 to free malefor
well kidnap definitely lured spyro there
You don't have to like someone to work for them.
7one thing that annoyed me about ANS: Cynder SUCCEEDED. why was Malefor not released there and then? all four crystals were put into convexity, yet for some reason he wasn't released like he was supposed to be
7and why did Convexity start randomly collapsing like that?
7at the end of TEN, wasn't his body formed of coalescing smoke?
7why not just go find some camping cheetahs
Who knows, TLoS has alot of plot holes.
amen
so confusing
.... why i never really pay attention to stories in vide games
7fucking internet
/me throws his shirt at the crowd.
I mean, hi D:
R
What a surprise...
7seriously. why will nobody explain to me who she is?
10....
10NO
10IM ME
10GOD
10EXACTLY
10THANK YOU
hey does anyone know what will happen if u don't use fury at the end of the gaul fight?
die
like if u don't press R2?
oh what does he do?
10*hugs icy for explaining something so damn obvious*
gaul
lazy knocks you to your death
lazer*
oh rly?
10yeah it does
wow
yah
that goodness i press fury
10Gaul is just feh to me
i know what happens if u don't use ur fury on cynder
she uses hers
10never use darkspyro on gaul
wait his first form?
10yes
why?
10because
half damage done to him
10gual has pretty much dark power
10powers*
10so yeah 50% taken off
You can't use it on the first battle.
10but
10you can use it on the second
i know someone who on the 2nd part of the gaul fight, they used all melee moves
10so you can whoop his ass
dark spyro not good against some creatures as well liek the tree guys int he 2nd level
10yeah
they didn't use convexity
10wait why?
10they have poison i thinl
they just used dark spyro's combat move
10think*
7what's with the fury powers in DoTD? seriously, they just completely ignored previous fury powers and made them into giant purple lasers
10ah
amen
did less damage compared to other elements
10WHOO
10LAZERS
10but yeah
i would of liked to see spyro corrupted
like cynder was
10i would have liked to see a poison fury
like see what happens if gaul takes his egg
not cynder's
10stupid DOTD makers
10i know right
too lazy to change it.....
i wanna see dark spyro stay dark spyro
10its just god modding
7no, it's power playing. learn your words.
10ehh
10whatever floats your boat
i hate that cynder pushed spyro out of the beam
7actually, no it's not. it's just stupid
10hmmm
10probably
i guess she knew he was corrupted
10and why does cynder have four elements?
10i mean they say
10it was the dark ''gifts''
10but she only used fire in ANB
how come we don't see cynder in TEN?
10so like WTF
there for like a few scenes.....
lol Jim Carrey in the credits
10haha lol
7well, considering they made her eleventy times bigger than she should be there was some serious genetic fucking around up in there, so I would assume other things were affected
10oh okay
my friend's name is in the credits for ANB
7considering she was a wind dragon but she could use fire in ANS
Daniel Cox
lol
10hmm that could be the fact
7not ANS. why do I keep calling it that?
10but still
10lol
10XD
was Exhumor in TEN?
10no
no
7Justin: no it's not. shut up and stop attention seeking
10yus
10Cynder shouldnt have convexity breath
10like where the hell did she get it?
why not?
oh ok
no that was jeff bennett
7convexity breath?
that's so funny my friend's name is in the credits for ANB
7Justin: no it's not. shut up and stop attention seeking
u shut up
I get the voice actors confused, besides, they have such short roles.
greedyfloof
i'm not even talking to u
7you evidently are
no i'm not
bug off
7you are evidently new to the internet
whatever
i liked dotd
10greed is good
except for the furies
10j/k
i wish they had the furies they had in ANB and TEN
7every time I see that I keep thinking people are saying furries. although both would be applicable
i thought Cynder breaths convexity
lol
7you can't breath French
i meant the breath
7right. what exactly is 'convexity' breath anyway>
7when does she use it?
at the end of ANB
7you mean the fire she uses?
7which is clearly fire
oh
7an odd shade of red for fire, but still
alot of ppl think spyro should of encased him and sparx in the crystal
and let cynder to die
7that's because people get oddly vehement about games
7they would make bad religious leaders
well spyro breathes convexity
7... when?
at the end of TEN
and ANB
7that's dark spyro at the end of TEN
7and ANB it's inexplicable purple dragon powers
7not convexity.
7convexity is a place.
lol
7you don't breathe Spanish
7the inexplicable purple dragon powers are impressions of his face anyway. what sort of sense does that make?
7it's clearly a corrupted dark poer
The only time I've seen anything refered to as Convexity breath is the ray that Spyro can use in his Dark Spyro from that is unlocked at the end of TEN when you complete some challenges
7power*
7how would it even begin to be Convexity? that's just where they sent Malefor to rot
evening together. Finally home...
7a handy seperate dimension that they could easily access at the time
i like dark spyro
he whoops butt
7that's the idea
7power over morality
i use him on the dragon challenges
/me sighs
I wonder if kipi's still around
7isn't that cheating a little bit? like bringing a warhammer to a knife-fight
I forgot all abot the dragon challenges.
kipi hasnt been on in a long time actually..
he's been unhappy with me
my cat's sitting on me again ;_;
Oh joy!
and you guys actually LIKE cats
lol
/me runs
what?
:P
Oh, happy day...
what?
because he's angry that I keep ignoring him on IRC or messing up roleplays
what?
o3o
ok
I dont use IRC often here I know -_-;
I not only have ADD but I have high functioning autism
anyone beaten the dragon challenges?
once long time ago
Yeah,only once.
the hardest one is the 1st one
and he doesnt know this?
"My dad tried to hang me by my shirt up on a door once... once."
nope
the 4th one is good
Thanks, dude.
I should have told him before hand so that he wouldn't give me a hard time.
7it may take a couple days to read
But I havent seem him on the chat in weeks
or longer
ever since the voice thing
7anyway, the reason I originally brought it up was because I'm gunna be helping the dude with a future arc-book-thingy on it
That's so clever.
Oh, I see. Epic.
but I dunno. I guess you can ask him. but he'll probably be growling at me for telling people here on IRC.
voice..thing?
7I know
drf; yes
but I'm FAR to lazy to tell you
Um, is this guy aware that Entei, Suicune and Raiku are the legendary cats?
weren't they dogs...
7they're dogs
No, they're called cats.
7they're the legendary dogs
Lies! xD
7you're the first person I've met who calls them cats
>.> dogs
7I understand both are applicable
7it's just that dogs is more common
Fair enough.
7he's now doing an arc that focuses entirely on the legendaries.
7Lugia is leading a revolution against him
Sounds good.
I'm curious if he uses spellcheck... ever.
7he gets much better at writing later on
this sucks
7this one was made two years ago
/me nods.
does anyone ever have one of those "blahh" days
?
bbl going home
I laughed though when it said: "Do not lie to me, Suicine!" HoOh barked.
*Ho-oh
nvm
7he's been writing them practically non-stop for nearly two years
7he gets far better
I don't doubt that, it's just funny to make fun of.
anyone here rom hack
Enjoyable story nonetheless.
7he's gunna re-write the first one eventually
7anyway
7they kick ass
Hm, Ash is in it, eh?
7yeah. he's one of the main characters
7one of ash, one of may, the current legendary one
Cool.
7and next either a second johto (the one with may) or a sinnoh arc
7I'mma help him with a future Ranger arc
Is it sometimes collab FF then?
04morning
7no, but he does get help with certain parts when he gets stuck
7lots in the legendary arc
Ah.
Do you write there often?
FF.net I mean.
7no
7it's just I review his a lot so he trusts me and I sent a message about an arc and he said it was a good idea and asked if I would help
/me exhales in relief.
7thanks ^^
:P
Why have you adopted girlish faces?
7it is not girlish

Burnout Paradise?
Or the other ones?
Feather
I saw a feather at that park today
7paradise
7it has to be said, it's a good game where people ENJOY crashing at times
:OOOO
LOL
7we got the ultimate collection so we got the Back to the Future and the Nightrider cars
LUCAAAAAAAS~
Hahaha, my friend was telling me about those.
DEFEH, CLEAN YOUR SHOES
He was obsessed with it until Forza III debuted.
umm
/me tilts his head
:o
04hi Feather
hey guys, whats going on?
04nothing much
:o
hey |D
I'm playing EverQuest 2~
04anyway brb
,-o-,
7they do kick all ass
Hi Lyon
7although I actually prefer the road mode of the back to the future car instead of hover mode
7although hover is good when boosting
Mhm.
Do you have it for PC?
sneas :D!
03ih
7yeah
!sneas
/me now belongs to ChaosLord for 7 minutes
/me cuddles a pole.
:c
7I found something funny. On one car no matter what you do to it the windows in it will never break
7I hit another car and slammed roof-first into a suspension bridge
Now is that a glitch or an intended aspect of the car?
That's funny though.
03looking at old yearbooks is wierd :3
10......................
10hey ranodms
Hi, PMS.
because you look so OLD
10.......................
7I dunno, probably a glitch
10so what have we established now?
7I've been trying to reach Terminal Velocity with the Back to the Future car
Well, I think you're the one who established it, Cyndi.
You yelled about it earlier.
10established whut?
10nvm
7it's not that easy, considering the bastard doesn't like to turn when in hover mode
10WTF? XD
10china town yay
Cyndi: I'm not really allowed per se to go into the origin of your name.
10whut
7yeah, but it's slower. and for Terminal Velocity I need speed
Ah. That's cool that they put that in there for the individual car.
7you have to pay for the user of it
03lol
03XD
7so it should have awesome things
10okay i have no idea whats going on here
7if you're not going to ask what Terminal Velocity is I'm going to tell you
10......
10well?
KJ: Is it when you go so fast you die? xD
7when driving into oncoming traffic in a stunt car it delivers small packages of boost every 200 yards. the faster you go, the quicker they're delivered. so I'm trying to find the boosting speed where it's delivered so quickly it matches the use of the boost so you have infinite boost
10okay.....
That's freakin' amazing.
10*posh voice* my toilet is so fancy its filled with bottled water!
7also, busses are instant death in this and they barely get damaged, no matter what the speed, so I'm trying to kill a bus too
7I hit Terminal Velocity once on the highway but I can't do it again
7the problem with driving that fast into oncoming traffic is you have very little time to react to oncoming cars
Well, it seems like t'is it a difficult thing to recreate.
*it's a difficult
7it is
7it's easier with a speed car because they go faster, but their boost is different so it doesn't count
Salllly! :o
Hai!
Argh.
Hi :o
7and there's this one kickass spin ramp on the highway, and since the back to the future car leaves twin trails of fire when it boosts, so I wanna hit that boosting and leave fire spirals
/me is on iPod.

10What game is that?
03Simearth

/me wikis it
03It's slow but passes the time good :3
10"the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc, then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve."
10at first I thought it sounded boring, until I see game screenshots o-o

hey :3
7and trying to create brand new empires from scratch to fight them with me is annoying because they just start fighting each other
7completely ignoring the fact that they live in the heart of the biggest evil in the galaxy
lol Pokemon creepypasta
Are all of these empires real people?
I'm going to go wash my mom's car for her, I'll brb
7no
7NPCs
04back
7I don't think you can interact with real people in that way
7it would kick all ass
7have you heard of Darkspore?
No, I'm not too familiar.
7it's basically an action RPG but with the spore creature creator engine. you get DNA to use as weapons to fight off the bad guys
7I really hope there'll be space combay
7combat
Oh, it hasn't yet been released?
7no
lol
7just been announced
7we've only had one trailer and a completely useless pre-release website, designed only to house the trailer as if youtube doesn't exist
That's hilarious that they still do that for advertisement.
7there'll probably more stuff on there later, but that's why I frequent The Escapist
7and on that note, Pokemon Black and White will have no Pokemon that aren't introduced in that series
Haha, I love The Escapist.
Zero Punctuation is a riot.
*only
7yep. they appear once you beat the elite four, but before that only the fifth gen
7which are you gunna get?
7if you do get them
7I am because I'm a sucker, but still
03Back :3
I'll have to purchase another DS first, but I'll most likely get Black.
I'm genuinely interested in these games.
7I'm getting white because I hate the Black legendary. he looks like a robot chicken
10wbs
7the idea behind it is that everybody is on the same line, so that veterans don't gain an instant i pwn u all wiv my mad skilzz advantage over newblets
7I'm may get both because of the different locations thing
You'd choose one over the other just because of the legendary?
04wb
7yeah
7plus, White Forest sounds awesomer than Black City. whenever 'forest' comes into it, I invariably go to Celebi. who is the awesomest legendary
7because let's face it, you fuck with celebi and she'll go back in time and cockblock your dad from getting with your mum, and you never existed
03:3 3:
aww

yay my mom kicked me out of the house
7then how do you have internet access?
i'm sitting outside my house
where the wireless thing is
7if your wireless thing is just sitting outside your house I hope it doesn't rain
i hate her
she kicked me out of the house till i shower
and she won't let me in to eat dinner
7she does realise the shower is inside?
or nothing
no cause she's retarded
point is i can't go in my OWN house
till i shower
Back!
7isn't it really her house?
ok fine but isn't she being a little f*ded up
7did you explain to her that the shower was inside?
yes
she said idc
7was it in a calm and collected manner?
yes
7I don't believe you
she told me to use a hose to shower
i'm not lying
7do you own a hose?
yes
:o
she says she doesn't want me stinking up her furniture
7do you have a high fence?
no
screw this i'm going in
she can go jump off a cliff
7do you live near any cliffs? because it can be quite a journey
XD
This was so funny to watch.
no
what was funny to watch?
The banter between you two.
And the fact that you just wouldn't take a damn shower.
haha
not funny
Justin won't like you if you have body odor.
i shower
and i sweat cause i play video games and go outside
but she smells too
7you sweat playing games?
she smelled like dead meat yesterday
yes
7UR DOIN IT RONG

There's my point. xD
excuse me for hating my mom sometimes
geez
thank you :)
No, I mean you're practically jumping on my head for saying that you amused me.
oh
ok i apologize for that
youre welcome
i'm sorry for jumping down ur throat
It's fine, lol.
here's the prob she acts like i don't shower EVER
i do
Hey, just for the sake of my state of mind, can you /nick a shorter name?
Because it takes up two lines on my comp.
JLF
Yes, can you change it to that?
k hold on

Inexperienced, aren't we?
there u go
this is much easier anyway
Thanks.
You could have just typed /nick [namehere] though.
Didn't have to /quit.

that makes it much easier

Hello peoples.
Grudge and The Ring were okay, what's IT stand foir?

Never watched more than a few minutes of that, I was little.
'But I watched a lot of scary movies as a little kid.
Hello~
ah
the omen remake is good
7I watched Final Destination 3 when I was like 8, just before going to Alton Towers
final destination 3 is good
Final Destination isn't scary, though.
It's more like a thriller.
7it is when you're 8
7add that to actually going to a theme park two days afterwards
7that was a fun trip
I have the same reaction to horror now as I did then
But, lol, that's funny.
DEFEH
:D
the only thing i hate in the Omen is how the kid wins
7what happened to Gordon?
i wanted to shoot that kid
/me shrugs.
They built it up pretty nicely.

12hey
evening
7Hi, Arti.
12Hi ^^
o3o
that's me
12Again I am finding problems with files that I REALLY need to use right now.. and the guy still hasn't replied
besides...through Facebook - grab a phonebook and try and call him ;)
12No he replied this morning about the cloud but nothing else
12All his info is hidden
you got the city, right?
just look at the phonebook for his name^^
2ARRRTI! :D
2Hai
2And Hai Time Shift! :DD
2heya Timey
12But yeh I might do that
online?^^
no idea if England has such a thing, but we have here in germany^^
12There's no phone book online reliable enough
lol @ this one troll
so amusing o3o
eh?
interesting^^
12They all suck
CCTV all over the country, but not a single reliable phone book. You english guys are odd^^
12:|
12Thats one thing I frikkin hate about my country
12CC frikkin TV
why?
12Because they put them EVERYWHERE
you're filmed and recorded everywhere
Hey
12I wouldn't mind but they don't actually solve more crimes than money they spend!
the only fun-thing: A band used cctv for their advantage
Oh?
they took their instruments and played in front of each of those cameras....and then asked for the tapes
they had to hand the tapes out....and so they could produce the music video out of them
O-o
12LOL
http://gadgetopia.com/post/6379
Unable to hire a production crew for a standard 1980Â’s era MTV music video, they performed their music in front of 80 of the 13 million CCTV Â“securityÂ” cameras available in England, including one on a bus.
They then used BritainÂ’s Data Protection Act to request the footage that was shot of them.
12XDDDDD
12One thing
12Rubbish quality
12So you're better off just shooting it with a home video cam.....
12Dunno why they didn't do that.....!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqxYlvjIEw4
their music video
!define materiel
-!- equipment and supplies of a military force
though the quality is not that good.....wow....what an unique idea^^
7So that's not a typo. o3o
12Dunno why they didn't do that.....!

Cyndi: Wtf?
10im a nudist
10i cant help being naked
o.o
Cyndi: Lol, it's the interwbes. There's enough naked people.
*interwebs
10MAI GOD
10YOU PEOPL CANT SPELL
10did you know
10that
10men are the real bitches?
10i mena come on
12dragonball z kai isn't that bad
12i mean
12i'd rather watch the original dbz series
That's an oxymoron.
6I guess
12but i'm not going to have a fit about it
10your male species rapes innocent woman infact they rape 5 year old kids too
6it definitely doesn't have charm to it, but it's not terrible
Your "species" rapes innocent males.
10they cheat on there girlfriends and wives
10im a human too
6I hated DBZ, but I admit to watching it whenever it was on
So do females.
6*and I could
10yeah but they cant rape can they?
10we*
Yes, females can rape.
10we cant rape can we?*
/me makes Aurora watch power rangers and hides
10no
10oh whatever
6ew
6never liked it
6never
12nor did i
10my point is you freakin males will do anything just to get a quick fuck
12the times when i was 3 or 5 years old doesn't count
They do almost as much as males, but it isn't reported as often because the males are ashamed.
6I still remember all the kids arguing who was better
6...even when I was that young I hated it
6but yeah, they argued, I simply said "they're all stupid"
6and walked away
10you males will do anything just for a quick fuck
10your such rapist paedofucks
6that was the era of pokemon
10no offense
6so, yeah :>
10if you hvent raped anyone in your life
10im lookin at you Icy
12lol
I haven't, and have no desire to do so.
Just don't think females can be any less sadistic.
10yeah but you males cant be trusted with a dick
Cyndi: I was raped by a girl the other day....
10aye right
>.>
10in the newspaper every fuckin day
Cyndi mentally rapes me daily. :/
Well, not raped....
10STFU
But girls are all over me, it's crazy...
10EVERY FUCKIN DAY IT ALWAYS SAYS A STORY ABOUT KIDS GETTING RAPED
10IN FACT IT PISSES ME OFF SO FUCKING MUCH
Because the media thinks we should care about people we don't know....
Icy: IRL or here? xD
10THAT I WOULD TAKE A KNIFE AND CUT OFF EVERY WHO HAS RAPED SOMEONE'S DICK OFF
Both....
10every man*
10damn
All of this coming from someone who's like twelve, and biased by gender, is sort of irrelevant.
10i aint tweleve
Cyndi: that was actually considered a punishment, but was deemed(adain can't spell) inhumane.
10.....
10fain
*again
10but still
You spelled it correctly.
10i get pissed everyday
Cyndi: How old /are/ you?
10you don need to know

lmfao
/me dies!
....I didnt even notice the yiffman part LOL
why did you say you dont have the skill anymore?
:O
12Because I struggled to do anything good for half a year
They ought to make one of us a mod already.
No one is regulating the forum.
03sigh
03my mom is such an idiot
03We're at a McDonald's, right
mhm
03and I said I was thirsty
no... dont say that articuno...
03so she asked what I wanted to drink
03and I said Dr. Pepper
03and she was like "How about something without the calories?"
03an dI was like "Why did you even ask if you were gonna say no?"
That'd be so funneh.
Ask theowlette.
12It's true though, there was a six month gap between my art
ESPECIALLY TO SOOTY
I gotta go too, see you asholes later ;D
12and lol
We could work towards making it popular again.
"WHAT I'M 18 AND THAT MAKES ME AN ADULT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I SHOULD BE A MOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
It'd be so fun.
...
*assholes.
ffffffffff I'm not pming her :P
but your are still better at art than me
you*
Why not? She already said she'd consider it back in September.
/me 7is back.
7For now.
meh
Just tell her that none of the mods are active very often.
12Hai :>
12So's the forum
Not that there's any work to be done, but it'd be fun.
7Ah.
Icy... makes me lol.
lol
you PM her she's the one that told you she was considering :P I knew nothing about it til you said so
lol
7Well, thank you.
12but the site might go down now XD
12We'll see
7O_o
7Why?
...
12Moving servers
problem
eh
this isn't working
7Huh.
12You might have trouble connecting to the Lugia.us domain anywhere including chat
7D:
ok then i wont mind
7But...
Well, we haven't tried yet.
true
7Where can we contact you, then?
She doesn't like me very much.
I would imagine ever since you sent her that spider picture :P
12You can still use the IP addresses of the IRC servers to connect, or ocean.systemnet.info
7Ah. Thank goodness I still have the latter link.
03.info domains FTW
i dont...
FTW?
It wasn't even a complete picture file...
12FOr the win
12And Sky, just write it down somewhere
oh
03Haven't you asked that like 20 times?
12THen put it in Mibbit if irc.lugia.us doesnt work
no
She didn't follow the link.
i was saying no to drf if you were wondering
actually I think it was a picture but the link for it broke
It didn't break, I mistyped the BBcode.
03I swear people keep asking what FTW means
Thank God.
12Lol
lol
12Remember this
03inb4 "what does lol mean"
/me hides
12What the f*** is WTF??
hahhaahah
03also reminds me of
laugh out loud DRF
03<personA> WTF is a palindrome
I'd say we'll survive about 1-2 days of chat abstinence^^
I remember people thinking ftw meant "F*** the world" ... xD
03<personB> No it's not
12OH YEH LOL!!!
XD
7Well, for FTW, lol.
arti can i PM you?

7Eh?

7Let's see you host a site of such scale without some sort of support. o3o
I never said I could. I just say that they are very good at placing those support things in community hotspots ;P
I guess they're masterminds. Maybe even evil ones. Oh well.

Infaz: A random noob from SC.

04all 2+ GB of them
Now hush, I'm reading about Harely Quinn. :P
never met him/her
uh?
batman?
04then i downloaded the scans for the 3 sets that were released when i sort of lost interest in playing
Yes, sir.
:/
Ramen
I would play if there was someone to play with... building a deck for the sole purpose of self-testing is just pointless
ah
oh god I remember downloaded all those card scans
MEN!
it tastes good
ll
*downloading
*lol
Men taste good?
o.O
no ramen does
I could be watching Indiana Jones at a drive-in right now. But Fran Drescher stole my caboose and stole the cube away.
04lol

No, a literal caboose.
I want it back!
get your rear cart back then
04i'm thinking of playing again Quilava

Nothing is on TV

ya got to turn it on first bud
right now my tv is off :P
I don't watch TV anymore. Well, that's a lie, I do on Netflix.
i'm sorta curious about netflix
how much do you pay?
I have instant. Nine dollars a month, and I get a crapload of movies and TV instantly.
streamed or delivered by mail or what
its fun, but nobody else is into it
Streamed.
ah
If I want something that's not available on Instant, they'll mail it to me.
Hi ya
03hi
What goes on?
But they sent me disks in the mail that let me watch it on PS3 and Wii, whereas it already supported Xbox and PC.
*discs
03not much
12Sounds fun.
04i'd play :/
04but i don't challenge
04i just accept or decline them
04that's how i pretty much am with everything
I don't challenge, I play for fun :|
/me is now away - Reason : Drop kicking
O.o

The characters are better... because anything has better characterization than Twi-fail.
12also we missed you, wb
2I did
2not my fault
2and I had my characters passed off
12i know
12aero didn't do that good though
In fact... I've seen Monty Python routines that have more fleshed out characters than Twilight. :P

12hmm
12I can't wait for this movie to come out
12how was camp?
oh, ok.
well I'd still have to make a deck in that case though
04i don't make decks
04i just copy othe peoples decks XD
lol
you should try making one
also I just brushed my teeth and drank some juice.... It tasted like medicine <.<;
04that's why i always wait until i drink something
04for some reason
04if i drink water it hurts
water is usually what I use to make the horrid taste go away
04its like it burns my cheeks
because toothpaste burns off the inner layer of your skin <.<
thats how it 'cleans'
then when you wash the residue off you can actually feel it
download this -- rename to .rar -- http://i38.tinypic.com/ftn8ly.jpg
Uhhhhhh, no
04i see
04i have some really DEEP tooth stains
04i've been using that 3D White toothpaste for over 2 weeks and my teeth haven't gotten that much brighter
04it says it removes 80% of surface stains after 2 weeks so it must be deep
yeah.
hey Icy
so uh, I currently don't have a deck
04what happened to the deck on your older computer?
..its on my old computer
04you can't find the file and email it to yourself?
I could, but my sister has my old computer
04oh
04ohhh
lalalallala being banned from freenode stinks lalallalallalala
Hey!
04i think you had some sort of landfall deck
04that liked to mill cards
Sorry, I was doing something, as always...
04don't worry i found a card you'll like Quilava :P
Anyways how are you?
alt F4?
04http://www.mtgvault.com/images/cards/WWK/Jace_the_Mind_Sculptor.jpg
good
my bf and i broke up
we're kinda blah right now
huh
04the -12 effect
04lol
Oh....
you know
if there's a creature that gets bonuses from exiled cards in your discard...
using it on yourself might actually be a good idea
yeah
doesn't bother me
Ok...
04the point is to target your opponent
I know
04and there you go
04you just exiled their entire deck XD
but you don't HAVE to
Well' I've been alright myself.
04i don't know if there are any cards
it can be deterred by reliquary tower + drawing cards
04that get bonuses like that
04btw
04i found this other card
04it's a 6/6 creature with flying and trmple
04lol it's effect is the best effect ever
04You can't win the game, and your opponent can't lose the game.
lol?
04so basically the 2nd you play it down
04*second
04you can no longer win
04but your opponent can
haha i beat skabb
04so you got to play it with that creature that say you can't lose and your opponent can't win
with earth
=D
04having them both out would sort of be ".... why are we playing again?"
get this
those medium size guys he unleashes
they threw bombs
and the bombs hit him
as well as my flail
lol
o.O
that reminds me of my brother's yugioh deck
Weird...
so it was like too much pain
where he ends the game with like 20k life, when you start the game with 8
i also used my fury on him to help
inb4 fail
04lol
anyway
my sis is gonna let me borrow her comp.. eventually ><
04ok
04hopefully you can find the file
well glad ur doing good icy
shouldn't be hard to find
04yeah
04unless the file is no longer there
04for some reason most of my decks were missing
..sucks
04well sort of
04it's hard to explain really
02people poofed D:
04magic workstation could find it but when i tried looking in the same folder i couldn't find the actual files
hii NS ^^
yeah... I think I got that too. <.> I'll check when I get on
I haven't played spyro in a while >.<
04ok
oh lol
04lol i bought this magic card earlier today
04basically it's a black card that says at the end of your turn
04you reveal the top card of your deck and your opponents lose life equal to the converted mana cost of that card
hey do u know what the chronicler meant when he said "this power is accentuated by ur impulsive nature"
04i wonder if there is a card that costs 20 mana to summon
I guess that electricity is impulsive...
?
02hi

exactly
..even if i found a proxy, i wouldnt be able to use my useraccount though... since they banned my cloak also
Haha
04funny enough it might be the most expensive mana cost card in the game
sounds like my Walmart too
04but it's a really bad card lol
the 1mil?
04no
04draco
04the highest converted mana cost card in the game that isn't from unglued or unhinged
*JLFpoke*
lol owie
You wont need a proxy, rather restart your router
theres only a couple of the managers i like out of the bunch and 2 others i respect
that hurt the Mac guy
04for 16 mana it's like a 9/9
Thats a better idea
but enough of that
04and you have to pay 10 mana a turn to keep it in play
i got to go
adios
Oh noes!

Hey RDX no.2

i didn't even see the client
there could be two Cyndis
Haha, I'd say that's creepy, but that's what you want me to say. ;)

It was definitely an abnormal form of comedy, but it had glints.
I liked it.

lol Justin Long's in this movie
It was funny on account of how much they built up the storyline, only to yank it out from under you as the real joke.
he's going crazy
trying to prove his gf ain't dead
he's like she ain't dead
she's alive
Uhh....
SHUT UP!
The villain they were slowly developing ending up doing nothing, the two main Jedi disappear basically, and no one even acknowledges the whole story when Bob writes it.
?
Haha yeah
Soooo
IT"S TOO QUIET!
Justin Long fails.
DO SOMETHING

Uh

It's not one of those things

You'd know.
But it's a cult
It's an actual cult

I was just referencing a song for no reason.

I'm straight btw....
04that will make it so much easier
If you can't understand him, use this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JUVyuH6Ux0&playnext=1&videos=NEMYNxRmsG8
03ah, innuendos
oh
03fun stuff
I'll let it load as I go to le' restroom
not for us D:
He likes to, er, joke with me about that.
ah
ninja pillows
Alright, use the second one preferably.
D:
That was long ago.
Yeah, it's a cult :(
Wolf clans == the new cult
04basically it's a planeswalker with a -1 ability
Is gay marrige even legal in Florida? lol.
ninja pillows with lasers
04-2*
04you search your library for any one card and put it to the top of your deck
D:
Pedo ninja still pwns.
04so you get baneful omen out, get Liliana Vess then use -2 to put gleemax to the top of the deck
dude the bf died
in the movie
I'm not sure. If it isn't, it soon will be with Prep 8.
I'm asking her questions, like, "are there demands for total faith and complete trust?" and she says yes
They killed justine?
he winded up in the same position as his gf
*Prop
that's awesome
Now they can make ghost love.
;P
lol the gf is buried
but the bf was like I'm not dead
Then they may need a few shovels.
lol
good movie
very odd though
whats gleemax?
crap I was loading the first one
and I can't understand a word of it
but it looks and sounds hilarious
04that card with 1,000,000 mana cost
brb
brb
I love you guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys!
04gleemax is an unhinged card
>.>
<.<
04so it isn't a legal deck idea
Who is this girl?
04but who cares it's just funny
ohhhh
But get to it whenever.
what girl?
yeah I'm loading the second one now
BABY PRIEST
12hmm
what does the other card do then? :|
I expect it to become a meme soon.
it's a full second shorter too
lol
the bf suffered the same fate his gf did
04at the end of your turn
being stuck between life and death
04you reveal the top card of your deck
in a funeral home
hahaha
I love irony....
/me is soooo glad the "pants on the ground" meme was a fail
04each of your opponents take life damage equal to the converted mana cost of that card
me too
it was so annoying
ironic ain't it?
/me is keeping her anonymous for now
..oh
ow
also
04XD
cheap deck :(
04see it now?
I love saying "ya dun goofed" now
/me is just confused..
irl
04there, take 1,000,000 damage. good luck surviving that
Not a name
Yes...
But how do you know her?
etc.
Ha, really?
Did you see the vid and all?
there's ways to survive :P
like that creature that makes you unable to lose
Poetic justice is better.
04yeah
yep
well
just parts
04you are still a little under one million life in the red though lol
and I didn't see the original
My dog is to damn big to be all over me D:
04then you use that arfifact to gain a million life
04BROKE
The original vid was hysteriucal.
I tried to tell it to you guys before.
haha I just didn't listen did I?
:P
lol
hey does anyone use redbox?
..lol
I do...
do u know if u can keep a movie u rent?
like u don't return it
04hmm i should look into that
do they let u keep it?
Meh, no worries.
04to see if it's possible to have -negative life
I use it.
But Netflix pwns it.
oh
Especially in bed.
"Earth sucks; Our stomach; I can't do it!"
XDDDD
preaching baby is awesome
After a while, they just lake money away, and it counts as a slae.
*sale
so they let u keep it?
"I'm just a little- I'm- DURR"
XD
04hmm
"I'm strong! I forgot our song!"
04Quilava i wonder if there is a card
XD yeah
04that lets you take one of your creatures and put it under your opponent's control
You pay extra for a movie I think they'd prefer you to keep it.
I am laughing so hard
>.>
this video is awesome
Normal vaccinations aren't that bad. The most annoying vaccination ever has to be the smallpox vaccine. I felt like blagrh for a week.
04so pretty much you give them a creature
And it's not even required any more!
so wait they let u keep it if u don't return it?
My dad sent it to me.
probably
And since then I've been spreading it.
Mine was tetanus
xD
like i rented After Life from redbox
I hope it goes viral.
but i wanna keep it
Whole arm felt sore for a week
04i would probably play that with that one creature
OMG sme
same*
04that says you can't win and your opponent can't lose
I couldn't move it e-e;
same shot exactly
Is it a new movie?
yes
04just be like "i'm going to summon this and give it to you"
and same feeling
(You know... 'cause smallpox has been essentially killed off... except for reasearch labs in the US and Russia.)
lol
it came out on dvd last week
sounds like a decent strategy
it came out on august 3rd
But my vaccination will be for meningitis
except they could still kill it
like use it to block or something
/nick Altair
Through a friend
04that's why you don't play an attack deck
04you play something that mills their deck
red :P
how did that happen lul

through marriage
04you know
04i find it odd Quilava

04o-o?
04lol yeah
"I can see as your king... king. As your arms bleed!"
Duh.
:(
04what i'm thinking is that i'd play that creature who is a black creature btw
04with a whole bunch of blue mill cards like your silly crab
You're just cancelling it out
time warp :P
Hehe
04also there is this card my friend has for one blue that says you mill the top 5 cards of your opponent's deck
Yes'm
8 + 2 - 2 = 8
HOLY BALLS

04oh
wait rounded down
Hehe. My math is better :3
/me used words

:D

wbs LL
04and yeah that's it Quilava thanks

04how did you know that?
*left
xy + 2x^8 +3xy^3 = x
04oh well Quilava
I'm looking through the cards :P
find ?y/?x
Internets work now.
04that is just mean
Argh.
04play that with crabs, one island can virtually mean 8 discarded cards
What were we talking about?
I dun want to
only 8?
?
lol
you could get 12 :P 4 crabs x 3 cards
/me doesn't want to find x or y
04let's do a little math
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%82
nvm i got my question answered
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JUVyuH6Ux0&playnext=1&videos=NEMYNxRmsG8
04an average deck has 60 cards in it
That's what the ? was meant to be
Anyway...
Wb
mhm
basically if i don't return the rental in 25 days they charge 25.00 for me to own it
04at the very least there will be 53 left after starting hand
babies
They make good priests.
*sighs shame i rly want this movie
I dun want to find the partial derivative either D:
unless it's online
I can't help but think this whole vid was political.
indeed
04hmm
like ripped
ty
>:D>:D
I want to find waldo :D

:|
I could probably get at least 10 people to join
where are you getting these numbers?
Then I'll get bored and probably delete it
Show it to your friends, make it go viral.
04crabs is 3 cards right?
I'll join!
:D
yes
04so if you had 4 crabs out that is 12 cards
anyone watch the ring video?
on youtube
04then tap the island for tome scour which is 5 cards
delete it = get everyone to drink the poison cool aid
:X
Oh, I'm flattered, baybay.
except for himself
Wait, I closed that video but I still hear it?!
JLF: xkcd made fun of it, but yes.
YOU CREATEED JONESTOWN

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bed-intruder-song/id386478006
lol me either
"I'm sensitive and it good. I rule!"

04that's when you play this guy http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=74306&type=card

White people are way to sesitive.
04it's a distraction for that :D
:P
WHITE BOY!
jk.
I love all colors/
...lawl

Even the greens?
simply seeing the card on the field would make me ask
Love the green girls.
They're wild.
I'm on 108 channels, across 19 networks. I have 6 olines, 17 owners, 36 admins, 43 ops, 4 halfops, and 19 voices. I have abusive power over 243 people.
02xD
04lol Quilava i read discussion comments on that card
04this was one of the posts
04House game with a friend: I picked 10 of these lovely winning Creatures.
04Turn 1 my opponent played a Land, By the EOT, I said "Man I'm thursty give me some water please"...
04Do I have to describe what happened next?
So, when I make a human clan, I guess I can look for people to join :3
where: So you would like to join my human clan? :o
..lol
>.>
D:\
04LOL!!!!!!!

04XDDD
0460x ashnod's coupon
04Ur thinking wtf, right?
04Here's how it works:
04First turn: Lay 7 (or 8) coupons down and set ur opponent scurrying around getting drinks. While they're gone, put the 100 cheatyfaces in your pocket into play.
what is a human clan?
04in case you don't know i looked into what ashnod's coupon does
04http://img.coolstuffinc.net/products/mtg%20art/unglued/ashnod%27s%20coupon.jpg
03lolredstorm :3

I wants one!
04wb LL
I want a better one
kay.
wow nice
mine is starting to diminish in sound quality from usage
04Quilava i can imagine that, your opponent drops like 8 of those coupons turn 1 so you have to get him 8 drinks, then when you get back there is like 100 cheatyfaces out
No you don't
it's all an illusion
03you don't want to sell me death sticks
/me huggles back gently "..."
03you want to go home and rethink your life
O-o
It sounds worse each day
Gasp
whats wrong LL?
but i'm already at home
lol starwarsprequals
/me clarifies
I want an Ocarina of Time
/me rethinks his life every day ._.
o3o
/me is just playing -- he won't start a cult
lol
I'm good with a normal ocarina
I like the sound
the one I have here is a prop
I'
headache and I threw up a little :<
04D:
i'd prefer something a bit more custom and not mass produced like the one I'm using
.... you wouldn't want to join, would you? :o
A cult?
No thanks
:P
Aww :3
04oh D:
Still no
Awww
:P
okies
12hmm
I just got an idea for a deck.
although I'm curious what this euphemism might be that would make a cult sound like a good thing
/me sells drf an apple
04i know you did D:
join #PokemonParadise
lol
a wolf pack
D:
benefits?
D:
Like insurance
ah
o.O
02oshit
what were you thinking?
?
04Quilava there was this guy i always wanted to build a deck out of. :/
I was having difficulty imagine what a cult would have as benefots
*benefits
04i can't remember what it was though
o.o
And benefots too
New friends? :o
I can't think of any benefots a cult would have
heh fots
I was thinking things like "free meetings with your lord" and stuff like that
"free poison"
you know
\:O/
cult stuff
FREE?
/me drinks
cyanide
:3
:O
Haha
FREE cyanide
aw
The girl I'm talking to would probably join
I'ma start on a new deck
/me huggles back, shifting uncomfortably
/me misread that :3
I have to use my superpowers for good though :o
lol
/me liquefies where and uses him as a poison
\o/
04ok
03off to bed

Awww...
When I press start on my game I'm gonna crash :(
not feeling well...
I'm going early :<
night all~
04Whenever you cast a blue spell, exile the top card of target library.
04Whenever you cast a black spell, exile the top card of target library.
04Your opponents can't cast nonland cards with the same name as a card exiled with Circu, Dimir Lobotomist.
04o-O

And I'm alone again...
D:

Okay, so, I'm watching something on YouTube, and apparently the censored box is just over one girl's breasts
wtf?
Why just one?
Well, after this composition is done I guess I could start on a fanfiction
oh
/me pours where into a jar and seals it, setting it on a high shelf for storage >_>
o.O

I always thought the psp wasn't that great a system, but now that I have it, It's pretty fun to play.
12lol

Anyone here will hear a preview of what I have to write
Yeah.
Bosses suck though.

He meets with members of many other villages and learns different tactics from them to assist him in his quest.
let me make one minor edit first
no ur not
it's cool
i wish the bosses in TEN were easy
accidentally put in 6 lands instead of 4
Yeah...
the only one i found easy was the elemental dragon
and the blundertails
04lol
JLF: Is TEN your favorite spyro game?
storyline wise yes
gameplay wise kinda
Do you have the originals?
only enter the dragonfly
and hero's tail
This will also explain to an extent the unique moveset he possess in the game.
Have you played them?
yep
beaten them
Me too.
i do need to find the rest of the items in hero's tail
But I still think they're fun...
me too
I haven't played hero's tail since I beat it 4 years ago.
What time is it where you guys are?

Force reboot lol
12......
/me gets shot for her terrible joke
03how
03XD
haha
90's emo bands make good moosix
thinking the chronicler is a genie
Hold down the lock and home buttons until it reboots XD
12i'm going to have to have a talk with him
better than modern emo bands imo
12a serious talking
/me is currently listening to Pop Unknown
No, he's a stoner...
03ohisee
ooh nice
03xD
04fish
thanks ^^
Hello
03stupid thing
never heard of them actually
:P
:P
how old is the chronicler?
Notice how misty it is, and how he's into rymes?
his eyes are creepy
the chronicler's
STONER!
lol
oh my god
its oh my god
/me wonders how Lambderp can form an opinion of a genre without knowing any bands within it
:P
hey anyone know when the chronicler shows spyro his book, why does it play broken soul?
it doesn't play it on mine
Jimmy Eat World
Yes, I'm your god.
great band
Bow down to me!
err wait
jimmy eat world is not really 90's emo
they're early-present 2000's
nor is it that emo in general
they are more--- yeah
D:<
:D
there is a different sound between the timeline right there but they are supposedly the same
they're like the happier side of emo :D
but you also can't really form an opinion of a genre from 1 band :P
>:D
nah I guess not
Me either.
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG2FFpI5K3s
12o-o
also i'd like to see malefor when he was young
oh hey
02o.o
Hey.
Bad timing again?
And sexy! ;D
lol
just talking about the moosix
nope not at all
hi Ari :3
I'm still here
wide awake
Awesome.
malefor seems to think spyro's just like him
What musix?
emo
90's
:L
02What names, Quilava?
02xxD
:L
Oh, the real emotive rock, then?
mhm
That face looks so cool.
:L
http://www.youtube.com/
lol
...lolwut
Any particular names?
XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG2FFpI5K3s
12hi
the chronicler was wrong about cynder
she didn't concede
How are you?
Cap'n Jazz... where Scary Kids Scaring Kids got their name.
I thought you just said concieved. lol.
Well, I suppose not.
no concede
he said she'd give in
she didn't
so he lied
Unless that band is basically a symbol of the whole era/genre.
I hate lol but I'm useing it!
lia
*liar
he a liar
He wanted spyro for himself. :L
he did?
and jimmy eat world have gone more alt throughout this decade
:P
/me is currently looking for a whole new kind of music
Yeah, he has those pedo eyes...
"Still eating the world, eh, Jimmy?'
something like me
lol
i think he's not very wise
something like... rock, but nerdier
:P
Like electronica? :P
I suppose
but that's too dance-y
electronica never makes me think of rock music
like alternative rock
Radiohead blends it nicely. It 's not dance stuff.
02MULTI
when I think of electronica I think of seabound and wolfsheim/peter heppner
I'm telling you, he's getting blazed in that cave of his.
where it's like rock but with synthesizers and all
In Kid A and Amnesiac anyhow.
hax

6woah someone from brazil on the forums
12 Hello, Lambderp and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
I'm ok, thanks.
woot!
?
Oh, you scared me!
That was /risky/!
..XD
I just moved my IRC client onto a different hard drive
ok
a portable one no less
:p
Why?
so now I can use it on any compiter
cool
*computer
Oh, interesting.
and to make my laptop faster
too much junk on it
I'm currently using a DviD cable to project my comp onto a TV screen. Beats a little Acer monitor. xD
XD that's awesome
If I did that I would definitely loose a lot of quality
*lose
Luckily I don't lose any, really. I suspect it'sd enhanced. :O
But the sound is just a fraction of a second off, since it comes from my computer speakers.
hmm
that would make sensse
ah
If I hook up speakers to the HDTV, though, it might not lose any.
do it.
/me uses a computer like everyone normal
man i'm bored
lol
me too
:P
:3
Did that video ever load?
yeah listening to it now\
wb Lambderp
/me must get hands on another set of speakers.
sounds interesting now
thanks
just moved IceChat onto my new external hard drive
I like this thing
lol
Me too. :P
It's very eerie, or at least some of the other songs are on that album. There are few effects, but Morning Bell in the Related Videos is extremely cool. It's melodic and all that.
it is very eerie
that's a good word for it
That's whaqt I like about it, but it's not for everyone.
yeah
Pyramid Song and Revolving Door take the cake on eerie.
eerie isn't quite what I like
but I can understand the appeal for it
Eh, better luck next time/.
Eh...
I like soothing music
/me yawns
04back
but not when it makes me think there's a ghost behind me
:P
wb
xD
I get that.
I'm not insulting your tastes by the way

sozseatstaken 4 months ago
I love when I post stati of songs or quotes and people are like "What does [insert common knowledge here] mean?"
Haha yeah
Lambderp: xD
now this music I like
You should hear more of Bran New then. They're similar in a few ways,
Oh are you talking about the "Chew the fat" thing?
*Brand
xD Bran
Yes.
/me <3s brand new
That's not a great example, since chew the fact isn't used much anymore.
*fat
I knew what it meant
amazed that person didn't
But that girl is, quite frankly, a nub.
omg, 21 year old children's movie editor guy is lazy at cutting songs
haha
what a [censored]
/me youtube searches Brand Ne
*New
/me remembers her friend's video of mei the goat's ass with the struttin that ass remix
okay this is an awesome song title
Lambderp: listen to their song handcuffs
"I believe you but My Tommy Gun Don't"
XDDDD
02;o
Lambderp: "Good To Know That If I Ever Need Your Attention All I Have To Do Is Die."
deja was my least favorite album out of them all but I like all their albums
lololol I just searched for brand new handcuffs
Sowing Season...
so amazed I didn;t get some police videos
I know, right?
I'm not gonna lie, The Police were amazing.
I don't mean The Police
but yes
Oh, what then?
they were very amazing
"brand new handcuffs"
I don't think I said only.
Because I evern like Daisy a little.
you did
like a video of cops getting a new shipment of handcuffs or something
*even
you said the only song you liked on daisy was Bought a Bride that night too
Oh, I gotcha.
Yeah, I agree.
Daisy's only good song, really.
my fav on daisy was Noro
Wait, was In A Jar on Daisy?
yes it was
Never mind. Two then.
Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes...
I don't think I liked much from YFW.
It's been a while since I've heard it.
I love the type of sound/music thats on that album
Crap, "You Stole" was also good off of Daisy. I totally forgot about it.
this is sort of unrelated
but want to see something awesome?
Sure.

being a former Lego fan you should appreciate it
Haha, I love when people do 8-bit stufff.

DOUBLE RAINBOW
XD
:P
Bionicle is made by Lego.
bionicle = lego
shows how much I know
:P
hence how I knew he like lego
Haha.
because I too was a Bionicle dude
from the same forum no less
/me loves how he has like a hundred Bionicles MOCs in his closet.
/me loves how there was a bionicle movie
several actually
LMFAO
REALLY????
yep
They were good.
THAT'S....THAT'S....LOL
When I was like elven.
XDDDD
*eleven
I was gonna say...
02I lol'd
they kinda suck now
but back then...
oh man
02Well
Do you remember the Visorak?
like my first nerdgasm
02http://www.ho-ohrealm.net/chatstats/index_relmap.png
yeah
02congrats
IM LAUGHIN SO MUCH OMGGGGG
:P
The movie about them, where the stone Toa Metru guy gets caqught in a cocoon still cracks me up when I remember it.
Hahaha
Everyone's complaining to Vakama, and he's just like: "ekjrkehrjthjr4thb" all Kenny-style.
I actually lost interest before that movie
It was my heyday.
but I have a few of the toys
my heyday was all the original stuff
when it was all new
2005 was Star Wars Lego + Increasingly epic Bionicles.
Oh yeah
Star Wars legos were intense
still are
You can't back away from me Proto, I'm huggling you :3
Mhm.
I don't think people grow out of liking to build crap.
/me runs
mwahahaah
a
yeah I don't think so
/me is still attatched :3
It's the materials that change.
I know I just stopped doing it
yeah
now I use computer programs to build stuff
Exactly.
instead of legoes
/me runs into a wall repeatedly
*legos
>:3
/me protoects Proto form getting hury
hurt*
:D
This is funny yet I'm embarassed of it. During the volunteer work in NY, I got so bored I started playing with this little kid's K'nex.
and all who love building have that little urge for destruction buried within them
/me is running into the wall to knock you loose D:<
Yeah, totally.
or at least I hope I'm not the only one
XD
a computer
I want to smash a computer one day
See what it's made of.
a cheap one
yeah exactly
I did that with a GameBoy when I was younger.
Stupid...
it more ways than one
"see what it's made of" I mean
Right.
Have you seen the vids of those people who throw game consoles from great heights just to see them smash, though?
D:
No
They must be pretty spoiled, haha.
Oh yeah
04LOL
that's the thing
It was back when it was so hard to get your hands on a Wii, too.
o_o
if I ever break anything like that it would have to not be pointless
D:
And this kid tries to return it, and they won't take it for some reason. so he throws it off of the parking garage near a mall.
like a really old and really outdated computer that nobody woul take
But yeah, I agree.
wow
he must be really spoiled
kill the ghost
I remember waiting in line overnight when they were really new.
the Wii?
wat
Yeah, in like Feb. '07. I had saved up for like two years, albeit spending some but not a lot.
I'm gonna try to go to a midnight showing of the gahoole movie, it'll be the first thing I wait all night for
Hahaha.
sounds like me with the 360
I saved up for it for so long
So there was an error and they didn't ship enough. We waited all night in the cold for nothing. xD
XD
lmao that sucks
Yeah, see you know what I mean.
it's weird too
having a full time job it doesn't take that long to get that much money now
but back then
Yeah, it must be nice.
it took like two years
But now you have more stuff to pay for.
no because I'm afraid of spending it on fun stuff
afraid I'll need it for school or something
No, I mean like now you have to pay for gas and stuff you didn't when you were younger.
oh right
yeah that too
I've been working all summer
Walmart is a cruel master, I hear.
and the only things I've boughtne for myself that costed more than $10 were Red Dead Redemption and this hard drive
not my master any longer
and they really aren't
Oh, right.
they're pretty lax actually
too la even
*lax
/me nods.
Like Snorlax?
XD
I guess so
or at least my Walmart
Oh, I have something you guys will appreciate.
Infamous's sounds like mine though
lazy managers and all
what is it?
Mhm.
Hold on, a vid, again. :/
haha okay
eh I should be getting to sleep soon too
i'll wait like ten more minutes
It's like a big sexual innuendo thing... but with Pokemon... yet totally hilarious.
(GHOST command used by where_!where@9A4A5C.DCF3AA.A7B92E.8AE4CD))
Do you want it? xD
I know that it isn't what it means
but eh
oh well
l
o
l
is it the jynx evolution with boobs
No!
oh I wtched this
It's a song with the original 161 in puns./
*151
the rap that you linked to on facebook
with the song that goes "what kinda pokemon are you, how do you do those things you do? share with me your secrets deep inside!"
Lambderp: Oh, you saw it?
yeah
lol
The Birds And The Beedrills. xD
it's for if you ping timeout
Yep
and come back
And you're still in here
it removes the 'ghost' copy
I think he knows what it does where
now I get all these rap videos in my recommended videos
:P
he was trying to make a joke
Oh.
Lololololol.
Did you think it was funny?
but yeah I tend to take a look at a lot of what you put on teh book of facez
/me may be taking Lambderp's name a little too strongly.
I thought so yeah
Yay, attention.
you have a similar sense of humor to mine
Well, now you even know what I look like.
Gig's over. xD
but you, unlike me, actually post your humor there
lol yeah
Lambderp: It's what makes Facebook bearbale for me.
I was actually really shocked when I saw you put a real picture of yourself
*bearable
bearbale
XD
Everyone was. I haven't in the three years I've used Facebook.
I read that as bear bile
XD
That pic is over a year old, though.
"the bear bile of facebook"
Hahaha.
I guess. I'm several inches taller now.
And I lost some weight.
:P
it can be his rapper name
:D
Proto's right
Knee-On: Apply directly to the knee.
thats your rapper phrase
:D
I just sometimes fail at making it clear that my jokes are, in fact, jokes
:q
XD
lil knee awn
Lil' Nikeeshka.
D:
/me flops with a sandwich and coffee
lol, 21 year old amv maker guy just randomly told me he hated me because of his family problems
Alarmed face.
what a [censored]
/me catches the flopping Curly
wb
>.>
idk he's stupid lol
Thingdurr!
Thingdurr!
lol
WAT U SAY TO TEH ALMIGHTY THONGS
I asked him how it was at all revelant to anything we were saying
derp
hello
idk he's one of those people that tries to brag about being an adult and all his adult problems
Hey Thingdurr
thanks :)
he's almost as worse as sooty
You're welcome^^
/me waves from atop a tall tower
Still no dichro
?*
hurr durr
"You wouldn't understand! You're like, not even half an adult. Once you turn a certain age, life beings to cruuuuuumble around you!"
yes he's one of those people
u bah teasin mah
:P
>_>
he kept bragging and babbling about his girlfriend yesterday
Sooty works at Goody's. xD
what's a dichro?
dichroic filter
/me derp
It passes light of a certain wavelength
I'd be ashamed to even be in any way related to a place called Goody's.
oh
God Lambderp.
and reflects other wavelengths
laz0r stuff?
N00b.
same
Ah I see
that makes sense
I am a n00b when it comes to science
lol
I know little about science
Yet your name is the character for wavelength
>.>
Thingdurr, someone asked if the blue glow from a 445 would cause cancer
Hahaha
Well
haha pwnt
symbol
w/e u wanna call it
also the logo for Half Life
:P
hence why I use it
Physics came first :P
Well, I'm going to go also, since I have to wake up at like 9 tomorrow.
lol
you're right though
the reason it's the game's logo is because of science
And hence why I picked omega to use as my nick now :p
haha
gnite
so being someone who doesn't care for science I really shouldn't be using it as a name XD
indeed.
I'll stick around until he responds.
I've had to stop Proto murdering you three times already.
Hahaha
Oh hi
sorry
another channel was questioning my name
No worries.

>_>*
Hakuna Matata.

HYahaha

http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=4800976&id=559688491#!/pages/Baby-Priest/143346642352093
That may work, I dunno.
Done
I have liked it
Yes. Hehe, yes. Yes!
*"liked"
I had to screenshot for the default pic. There were no pics of Images.
*on
aww
It was so traumatic.
:D
it's a pretty good screenshot however
:D
Yeah, kinda. The quality of the vid isn't so great but when it was made smaller it looked good.
anyway
Well, seriously, g'night.
you leaving?
Yeah, I have to wake up "early" tomorrow.
I better go to
M'kay. I'll be on tomorrow no dobut.
*doubt
I was just about to post something but it's not important
I will as well
Well, go ahead.
A few minutes won't affect much.
it was the debate about my name in the other channel
[01:50] <+Lambderp> what's a dichro?
[01:50] <+Proto> dichroic filter
[01:50] * Omeghurr derp
[01:50] <+Proto> It passes light of a certain wavelength
[01:50] <+Lambderp> oh
[01:50] <+Omeghurr> God Lambderp.
[01:50] <+Lambderp> laz0r stuff?
[01:50] <+Proto> and reflects other wavelengths
[01:50] <+Omeghurr> N00b.
[01:50] <+Lambderp> Ah I see
[01:50] <+Lambderp> that makes sense
[01:51] <+Lambderp> I am a n00b when it comes to science
[01:51] <+Omeghurr> lol
[01:51] <+Lambderp> I know little about science
[01:51] <+Thingdurr> Yet your name is the character for wavelength
[01:51] <+Thingdurr> >.>
[01:51] <+Proto> Thingdurr, someone asked if the blue glow from a 445 would cause cancer
[01:51] <+Lambderp> Hahaha
[01:51] <+Thingdurr> Well
[01:51] <+Proto> haha pwnt
[01:51] <+Thingdurr> symbol
[01:51] <+Lambderp> also the logo for Half Life
Hahahaha.
:D
They pounced on you, man.
aww
they did
D:
one space too much :<
:(
notice how they're all copying my name too
"Omeghurr" and "Thingdurr"
eh they have a point though
Why, the name?
I should've used a different nerdy reference when I chose my name
yeah
Half Life is a science based game after all
true
The name originates from an acronym, though.
I think you told me once
what was it again?
3Playing: "Disturbed - Disturbed - 10000 Fists" (192kbps - 44kHz - Stereo)
Nyra Eclipse Optimus Nyra.

nostalgiaburst
I picked a retarded pair of usernames.
Get out Curly.
so that's why you went as Nyra Eclipse in #jailbait earlier today
Now.
/me kicks where
Where is Strix, speaking og?
you leave
:D
We dun want you around here no more.
not as bad as Mumble the 2 :P
T_T
Lambderp: Yeah, and Aic went as MumbleThe2.
:q
noooo
I talk to her sometimes
/me hugs Curly
Curly stays and where goes
Where?
:<
facebook and email
/me offers Curly cookies
/me hugs DT back
was Mumble the 2 her name?
Hahaha
/me was just joking :<
/me sits in the corner cookieless and unhugged 8(
/me hugs where
I'm just joking too D:
yeah, PM her on owlpages asking for it if you want, she still goes on there
/me throws a cookie to where
wow
>:q
Just tell me in PM.
I bet she won't mind, lol.
not that xD
/me noms quietly
nah
M'kay.
I'll ask her if you can add her
...*just saw that chew the fat girl*
"oh that's what I thought lol" yeah, I'm sure.
I know right
LAmbderp: Yeah... it was lulzworthy.
sje just doesn't want to sound dumb
\I stir our son's ice cream poop.
XD
Earlier her phone died and my friends and I text-spammed her with nonsense. There were like 60 message total so when she turns it on it'll be several minutes of textx before she can use it. XDDD
*texts
XDDDD
that's awesome
hahahaha
My other friend did this to my other other friend, during a quiet meeting somewhere, and it was like 80 messages referring to [censored]es.
that reminds me of when my uncle damian didn't know how to use the phone, I wake up every morning and I got texts with him fighting with some girl about taking care of a baby
He couldn't shut it off before like thirty seconds of noise.
because apparently the texts he made were sent to everyone in his contacts
and I'd get totally spammed with crap about a baby
LOL
XD
my roommate's phone did that
like i got one that says "you have to take care of him he cries he poops"
...which means I got texts meant ofr his girlfriend
and another that said "now I'm feeding the [censored]er"
that was...awkward
wow
sounds like yours was awkward too
XD
/me laughs.
A lot.
you have to take care of him he cries he poops
oh wow
She explains that she is nursing the kid? xD
I think so.
no those texts are from my uncle fighitng with some girl about it
and it's not even his kid I know that for sure
I think it was his girlfriend's underage daughter
@addquote <Uncle> you have to take care of him he cries he poops
aww
didn't word
This time you need !addquote
!addquote <Uncle> you have to take care of him he cries he poops
XD
lol
actually I think it was "it" instead of "he"
the lack of punctuation makes it so much funnier
I am tearing up from laughter
or maybe I'm just toom tired
*too
that stuff happens to me sometimes its called being high on life
oh amn
*man
I am so muffin high on life right now then
Haha did it work?
Yep.
D
*xD
LOL
Yeah, he's a protype Nazibot.

O_o hello.

Nope.
Ah okay
It's completely random.
Well, we just made one, and it came up twice in about five quotes.
you may return to whatever else you were doing
Crazy probability.
Lol.
I apologixe for having disturbed you and thank you for responding
Dari, isn't it already like a reaosnable hour of the morning for you?
*reasonable
man why am I so hyper?
It's 8:14 am.
I forgot to go to bed. :(
Hm.
XD wow
@quote
dude I forgot dari was even in here lol
heh
I said I was gonna go to sleep 25 minutes ago
LOL
This obnoxious kid just chats me on Facebook: "isnt it past ur furfue??"
XDD
A furry curfue
What, I ask, is a furfue?
Oh, there we go.
LOL
XD
and technically a cerfew isn't a bedtime just a time to be home lmfao
I don't think such a thing exists in Britain. :o
Not only is that a fallacy, since he's up to ask me.
Well, no one calls it that, anyway.
very few people call it that here
It doesn't reallt, except in emergencies. He used the word wrong, since it's not like I'm driving around the countryside.
or even have one
*really
02There you are
02XD
02XD
02I always do that
Well, it's past my furfue, guys.
I better get to bed.
Hello
me too
02xD
We have to use that now.
wow
Aw, c'mon!
I get on and everyone leaves?
really really bad timing
Now I gotta stay.
You people /guilt/ me into it.
same here
Heheheh.
I'm not tired at all, though, but I'd hate to fall asleep tomorrow.
I'm really tired
and I slept in way too late today
but I was home alone so it doesn't matter
tomorrow however
I was up all night last night, and took a quick nap for like an hour earlier last night and that's it.
Haha
nice
Haha, #jailbait.
I had to wake up at 5:30 yesterday so there was no point in sleeping/
heh
I know what you mean
I hate nights like that
I lie sleep
*like
Well, there is, but the logic is lost on me.
it's like a commodity for me
it's hard to get so I try to enjoy it when I can
actually, my insomnia is actually way better lately
Sleep is like my antithesis to being what I consider "productive", which sadly enough, is how much lulz is created in a day.
oh I will
for at least another 20 minutes
What I mean is, if I sleep, I am not creating lulz, thus sleep is not viable.
you create a full night's sleep worth of lulz every day?
ah
I see
I'm more kidding now, but I really don't see much value in sleeping if I can run on a low tank.
I hate running on a low tank so much I always try to get sleep
Dari: Have you seen the Baby Priest vid yet?
but say I had to get up at like 6 tomorrow
No... O_o
Isnt it past you guyses bed times
then I would accept it as a lost cause
Currently I set my own bed time.
axtua;;y yes
LOL
Well, here goes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JUVyuH6Ux0

such as?
Eating?

Coughing up blood?
/me is being very lazy with this collab with 21 year old amv maker guy
Masturbation?
Eww
I hope not either of those two
Sorry, I meant to say a more e-friendly term.

"Fapping."
It actually sounds worse when you say it that way
XD
None of those

"I stir our son's ice cream poop!"
/me is extremely late
Flammable
I love his hand motion when he says "ALLAH"
I swear near the end where he stops, someone goes "Thank you Jeeeeeeeeeeesuuuuuus".
They do.
They're cheering him the entire time/
"PREACH ON"
"Make ya arms BLEED..."
"I forgot our song, HOLD YOUR OWN"
XDDD
"I'm DOWN!"
apparently a user on a ip listed under spam/proxy
and he like skips to the other side of the stage
from what my alert says
Because sometimes what the baby says doesn't quite match and it's more wishful.
yeah
doubt it's right
hello monferno

It's a contact contagium, Dari.

I had one going with a friend, but he lost interest.
our stomach
I can't do it
You wouldn't tell me anything about it. :P
So now I'm considering trying to salvage it and make a novella or short story.
It was an excellent plot, I think.
Which reminds me, I have to find those notes I had on it. Haven't seen them since last summer.

after beating the elite four
then get a shiny stone from thos pokeathalon games
*those
/me has never beat the elite four. ever.
Hahaha
I barely did
because usually I'd have like a ton of level 15 pokemon and a level 80 pidgeot
XD nice
this time I'm trying to raise them all at once
I did that too this time
it made the Elite 4 really hard
because normally I'd have like one pokemon that's like level 80 and a bunch of other level tens
but this time all 6 were around ;evel 60 instead
*level
lol
:O
one of my friends got past it with pokemon above level 40, either she's an expert or it just works

Bet you didn't know that!
Hmm
Sorry, just got gang-raped by adware.
I think I'll be getting the green starter for that one
I didn't
:D
No, I just made it up... trying to feel relevant :3
BOOM
I killed dari's Pokemon desire!
What'd I miss?
YES!
/me wonders if they'll make a pokemon game where the pokemon take over and force the people to fight D:
just because I can.
Haha, you always forget.
I do
I've hardly written anyhting of value since... January?
*anything
So... World War II.... kind of like Pokemon... except they had Pokemon battles with people and guns and tanks and stuff
XD
I actually always wondered how wars work in the pokemon world
:P
meaning fighting type pokemon?
but the "legendary" Pokemon were better than the rest, so the regulars had to be purged.
Hitler was like, gotta catch them all, but Britian was like, nuh uh
[10:39] <%Aurora> I kick/kill for the enjoyment
Haha.

hahaha
did he write it?
If so I would so read it
No, some guy he knows.
aww
no fun
But it's painfully lengthy, like... okay, I won't say it.
O.o
I'm sure it would involve death and destruction. Lol.
BOOM AND THE POKEMON SPLODED IN VIOLENCE BUT WITH A TINGE OF SCI-FI EFFECT
pretty much
He said the premise of the fanfic is "What if Pokemon didn't faint, they died, and so they form alliances and beat the sh** out of each other."
XD
So, yeah, my client died :x
That does sound like something he would like
dun dun DUN
Hmm
"The pikachu glared at me, cheeks flashing. *BOOM* HEADSHOT "It was no match for my shotgun"
xD
Exactly.
Only it's poorly-written.
It said that Ho-oh "barked" something once.
He would XD
Sneeze
Lol, there was a creative aspect, though.
The Gym Leader of ghost type was named Morty.
xD
I beat him last night, kicked the crap out of him with my togetic named fattysp0tz
haha
Was the grass leader Woody? XD
No, that was the gym leader of the... other type.
I also have a sudowoodo named tr33m4n

Dari: Did you stay up all night yesterday also?
Nope.
Teehee.
Haiti.
My record of no sleep was six days.
I was so proud.
O.O
How did you live?
I've gotta go I just got yelled at my mom to go to bed lol gnite
yeah I'm gonna go too
night everyone
I remember when I was little, and had basically no brain, I tried to keep myself awake because I was afraid of losing consciousness.
"I must not lose consciousness, what if I can't find it again?" D:
So I was on day four of "no sleep" and kept trying to play Battlefront II but dozing off while playing. Like my fingers moved and all, but I was alssep. It was funny.
LOL
Dari: It was lost midway on the path of life.
*asleep
THE BIRDS OUTSIDE ARE C-CAWING
Mine only do that when they know it'll make me feel like shit.
"Noooooooooooooooooo, morning"
Bwha
:P
BRB, highlight me if you want to talk to me.
Okay.
I'mma go to sleep, though.
And all my friends say "Bye, bye..."
My pit?
My pit??
More of a ditch than a pit in my opinion
But maybe im just crazy like that

Well for the most part. I joined the gym this week. I think i hurt my elbow somewhere though. Lesse... college starts in two weeks 'n' I'm desperately lookin' for a job. Been meetin' some new people online though so... you know. Annnnd... I'm currently on a laptop
12Good luck finding your job :> where'd you get the laptop?
XP Figure though. The one time I CAN get on Neopets, I forgot my password and it's taking them forever sending me a new one through email. You'd think there's a guy going through them one-by-one by how slow it is
and I'm using my couin's laptop while I babysit
lol... actually, I found an old email with the password on it

Hi OpalKitten-imouto :)
I have to cooperate with him over a mutual friend though who isn't doing so well
I sent out a distress call at 6am when everyone just
8D
exploded on me
she was feeling down
people were wondering
where the heck is arrow
i had issues keeping MYSELF above the water
and I was all 'ugh bird, sorry to ask this of you but I need your support for this'.
so now we're cooperating.
12fair enough..
he made one girl cry for starters
and she was coming to me asking about why he'd done that
like i could provide? not really @__@;
/me hugs where

/me kicks DA for its lameness
8D
why the bold?
o.O
/me pets Espeon
because DA also makes it bold
IF I copy an error here, it should be formatted correctly
12LOL
12That is SO stupid, what's the point in bolding that XD
12@ DA not you

maybe they think another thing MIGHT be able to happen during a search - besides an "error"

02I still love Pirates of the Caribbean
02And Xeli, he did
04lol
02Even go look
i already did
me and you still have those silly banners saying mod and admin wat
04gah
04brb...maybe
02o.o
02Yeah I know
did you know a 747 blows out about 8 tons of fuel if it needs to abort a landing attempt?
Really, Ben is either an evil mastermind trying to make the entire internet angry - the God of Trolls - or he's terminally stupid
12WOAH
12No XD
yes
12How high off the ground by this point, though?
02XD
02Hey
02I was typically the only admin who did something useful
wheels almost touching the ground
02or moderated properly for that reason
12Sheesh.
that's the amout for an emergency-go-around
02I mean seriously
02All those thread
02s
02I'm not even going to say what I went through
I can see him tell his members to "troll" "New GV"
and the fuel is only good for one of those maneuvers
I mean the only people who are really happy about it being back is him + this chainsawfangirl person
because, to carry these 8 tons of extra-fuel, the plane needs around 12 tons of fuel itself from the start
well i guess he gets a kick out of it, w/ever
02If he does try that
the fuel calculations itself is fun, too
I'm going to <censored> his site over so badly it won't be funny
02and/or report him to forumotions
Make that or
calculate distance, calculate average flight speed, calculate average windspeed = time to destination in hours
multiply hours with 30 liters of fuel
just report him to fmotions if he reports the site. He's reportable for member abuse or something I bet.
calculate alternate airport
add fuel for distance to alternate airport
02XD
add 15 liters emergency reserve
add 10% inproper maneuvering reserve
result: Amout of needed fuel
Can't wait to see his response to calmly asked questions
might dc nao
02D:
just for like a minute xD
dc?
ns update = dc test

dc what?
just to be sure

7Is everything with the servers settled?
12Should be ^^ can take people's connections up to 48 hours to update though
12But if you can see the site then it should be ok
7I apparently visit the forums more often then you, Arti. O.o

bleh, I just remember the maybe most-evil interview I've ever been told of^^
7O.o
interview for a flight controller
think about a really GIANT room - you enter a door on the one side and have to walk all the way to the other side of the room to three people sitting there and waiting for you
you're half the way and one of them says "you forgot to close the door"
how do you react?
7I'd close the door?
Smile and close that door :P
so you'll turn around, see: The door's already closed
7This reminds me of an urban legend.
Smile and say "what"
question: "Are you always that forgetful? Unsure? Don't you know anymore what you've done just a minute before?"
again the question: How do you react?
in case you just respond "I've already closed the door" you'll be asked "so you never double-check what you do? You think you're perfect and make no errors?"
that's just one example of this interview: No matter how you react or what you answer, it will always be wrong
welcome back :)
thanks again
hey
/me checks her router settings
You're welcome again :)
well

hai
Trying to get to the minus world
is difficult
lol
12have you thought about magic workstation?
12or are you still doing research to make sure it isn't a virus? lol
srsly wtf meng
what mario game are you playing Proto?
Super Mario Brothers
the original one that came bundled with the NES
along with duck hunt, the dual game
oh, okay. I thought you were play smw3 so I was wondering >.>;
hehe
The original minus world from Super Mario Bros. is the Trope Namer. The player can reach it by entering a pipe in the first Warp Zone after walking through a wall (thus, before the Warp Zone message appears). It consisted of the level design of the Water Level 2-2 repeating over and over.
yep
oh *just noticed the "walking through a wall" bit*
it's very difficult
haha
it sounded simple until I saw that xD
you have to break two bricks, and not the one right up against the pipe part that goes up
I dari!
and then jump backwards crouched up to there, standing up and you walk through the wall
I keep breaking the last block
5Hai!
6Hey
6I knows :P
5So, what's been going on?
6Nothing much..I'm just in a horrible mood since 2 am because of my fucking friend.
get lunar magic and use savestates :p
5Ooh... whut happened?
hehe
lol, I like how all these youtube comments are trying to correct the -1 thing and they all give different numbers for the world bit
6She had one of her mood swings and it affected me..Around 3 am, I was pissed like hell and on the verge of tears.Next thing I know I had started crying.And one minute later,I was laughing my ass off for no reason.Now I've burst to tears two times in the past hour.
"it's 36-1" "you went to 46-1" "this is world 0-1"
5C.o
>_>
xD
GAH
I had it
5Wow.
he hung up on the edge
;-;
6Indeed.
I don't like Super Mario Bros much myself
6Idk why it affected me so badly..
but I don't have any nostalgia going for it >.>
heh
/me never had an NES and barely ever played on one
the most memorable game on the NES for me was Kirby ... something. Superstar maybe
I bought this thing two years ago for $8
lol
:o
my favorite is legend of zelda, despite being terrible at it
/me 5feels nostalgic
I think I played that once, ever :p
:3
and I'm pretty sure I was only watching
I like the N64 Zelda games bettar
6):
me too ^^
Majora's Mask was just okay though
my N64 got stolen :|
I never really played much NES though
I agree
/me 5looks up. She is worried.
Ocarina of Time was just epic
I never got OoT :(
I need to buy it off of ebay one of these days
:(
along with Conker's Bad Fur Day >.>
I should see about getting another N64
It wouldn't be the same though...first video games I ever played were on that N64 x_X
there might be a few more N64 games I would have liked to own but I can't remember
I liked one of the toy story ones
I'd always give my dad the controller for one of the bosses
>_>
oooh
and vigilante 8
never played or seen either of those... although vigilante 8 sounds really familiar >.>
6D:
/me thinks she might have seen a review somewhere
I only had vigilante 8 second offense
yay chats back up :D
Great game
I loved the lunar rover >_>

5I sense there's something in the wind
I had a dream about Arrow.
/me pokes her mind
7Can you work offline without him, Arti?
5That feels like tradegys at ahnd.
5(hand)
12Quan, I am doing so but it's hard to move forward when parts of the project are missing..
5And though I'd like to stand by him
12As in, I need him before I can continue my parts
5Can't shake this feeling tht I have
6D:
5The worst is just aorund the bend
7Ah.
5And does he notice\
5my feelings foe him
/me is getting rather tired of all this

6Sry,I'm slightly confuzzled.. >.<
5And will he see
2i NEED to know this project
2its killing me @_@
12I know, it's killing me not being able to tell anyone!
2and i havnt even been here that long D
2D:
5how much he means to me
5I think it's not to be
5What will become of my dear friend
2it was the fist thing i saw when i came to this site !
5where will his actions lead us then?
5And though I'd like to join the crowd
5in their enthusiastic cloud
2is....it.....an animal? a mineral?
12I say nothing
5Try as I may, it doesn't last
7Lawl.
12No one gets any hints at all
2D:
5and will we ever end up together

I'm just remembering a really nice cup of oolong I once had in beijing...
I like Earl Grey the most, but I do not appear to find a single store selling some.
Didn't taste the same trying to make it myself :(
Hmm..
Too much hassle to order it online?
I am on now ^^'
Considering I do not have any methods of payment that would work online, that is indeed so.

Lugia
/me pokes
How are you?
that's something perhaps worth correcting
Bah, who gives credit cards to hitmen, seriously? D:
The income is good, but not steady.
debit cards work too
checking accounts without debit cards work too
but seriously, what checking account doesn't come with a visa debit
Most such payments are pretty much restricted to the USA, are they not?
7How's the project going, Lugia?
PayPal is accepted pretty much world wide, isn't it?
Mmhmm
and uh, so is visa
And MasterCard and other such stuff. :o
Visa Electron doesn't exactly qualify for such things though and I have no way of transfering money to PayPal.
have you tried?
sure, i live in the US, but I'm pretty sure PayPal has methods for transfering money via bank wire... aka checking account.
thats how they do it here
No, no moneys :3
"PayPal does not currently offer the ability to add funds from your bank account. "

Hullo, Lady Arti.
7Hi, Arti.
7Lugia's on.
I wish the forums were up. I want to see if anyone likes my fanfiction prelude.
14I don't use the forums much anymore anyways, so it really don't affect me. <_<;
I just want to share what I've created in my own mind with everyone else
You can post it on dA and share it here
Problem solved
The world is saved
I din't use dA
Etcetera, etcetera
don't*
GOOD
14WHUT?!?!
dA doesn't want you. D:<
It would be better if I didn't
no they dont
14Why?
14I use dA all the timez.
Because I'm not an artist
14Literature is an art.
I know it is
14That's why they call it language arts! :D
I just think it would be ridiculous if i did
oh snaps
03o.o
14How would it be ridiculous? There are plenty of people on dA that use it just for writing purposes.
bbl
14Well, then! :<
/me 14is sat on.
/me fluffs
03sigh
03I'm so tired right now
03but I can't sleep in cars
14Why not?
Sleep on a bike then.
03I just can't
03and wtf bike?
03I'm in a car right now
03on the way homne
/me floofs espeon
03*home
14Then ride a bike home next time?
03LOLwut
You've obviously never heard of the batmobile or the Spy Cruiser
03I've heard of them, that doesn't mean I'm in one
Have you tried to be in one?
14Well you certainly didn't imply that you AREN'T in one.
03My parents are not Batman
03so that should narrow that down for you.
Are they spies?
03no
That's exactly what a good spy would make you think.
14So they really are spies?
10GAH I GIVE UP

o.o Again?
14Yes?
14Why would Feather do that? :(
03stupid girls and shoe shopping
14I hate shoe shopping.
03they're seriously trying to find a shoe store on our way home so they can buy some stupid boots or something before the place closes >_>
03Those shoes will be there another day!!
Not unless a meteor hits them
14That seems probable at the moment.
03LOL
7o3o
7Hi. Feather.
/me dies
03those shoes will also not be there if the blasted o3o face kills everyone in the store
03which, knowing everyone here, is even more probable than a meteor
say sorry to arti from me if you saw her k?
7o3o
14What's wrong with the o3o face?
good night everyone
03Everything is wrong with it.
10>_<
03that face is as wrong as murder
7Bad connection, Feathie?
14Murder's not wrong.
14... Depending on how you look at it.
10my router is messed up (more than before lol)
03LOL WTF
03in that case
7DRF, what would the cause be?
03what cause?
14Well I have something of a point, don't I?
12No
12XD
03Nope
14darn <_<
12Also hi
12Im back
12Recovering
/me 7blinks
7Is it wrong to kill in self-defense, DRF?
heya, is xai okay?
03um
14Apparently it is if you can go to jail for it.
03in some situations no but that's very rare
14Then again that's a matter of opinion.
03like 99.99999% of murders aren't OK
7Then what do you say about, let's say, war?
14burn
/me 14hides.
12Oh ya Xai's absolutely FINE Â¬Â¬
03Um, yeah let's not get into this discussion about what's right and wrong
03point being that o3o face is annoying
03end of discussion
7Lol.
14It's amazing what conversations that face can bring up.
12LOOOOLZ
7Arti, you know, if a lack of Lugia isn't allowing you to continue with the project, you can do that double meme. :P
12I once put a kill script on it
12Quan, I;'ve tried ^^; its hard
7How so?
12i'm not as good as I used to be, I'm more picky with things
03sigh

03like
03remember when everyone and their brother wore wristbands?
03Now it's stupid to do that
03that o3o face is the same way

03I do have another battery, I bought a spare for times like this

12*Way
o_O
7Download for full view?
03MS Paint is awesome like that
03my monitor is epic enough that I can see it full sized without downloading
MS Paint for the effin' wiiiinnn~
they just show a documentary on TV about two germans founding an italian restaurant in New York....and they just got into the "best pizzeria in town"....
and...oh gawd
did you ever hear about anything like "Meat-lover-Pizza"?
03yeah
03<Articuno> All RCMs please raise your hand so I can add you? <- me
that's not a pizza anymore...that's a GIANT steak wrapped with pork and a little bit of dough, filled with cheese
03EW TELLING PARENTS TO SPY ON THEIR KIDS
03we just drove by a billboard that said:
03"Do you know who's :) at your kid online? You should"
03EW INVASION OF PRIVACY
ick D:
well
03also
03:)
/me hides
I think the parents should know at least slightly
especially if their kid is young
03meh
hi
hey
7You know what I just realized? That link I told you was saved as a JPG. :|
whats up
eh
7evening all
12Off out..
7D:
/me is boredly playing pokemon heartgold
lol
what pokemon types are best against steel
fire
cool
and that's the only one I know
You sure dislike JPG xD
I named him HURRRMAGIC
lol
more like HUURRFIAH
03well Paint notoriously sucks at it
....[censored] I should've named him that
7I've taken a different track to my normal strategy in SS: instead of training one Pokemon to the detriment of others, I just haven't bothered to train any
7It reduces quality, Espeon, that's all.
lol
LOL
7I've only beaten like 3 Kanto gyms
7But when it comes to pixel art...
7Yep.
/me 7suddenly realizes she needs to lighten up.
7also, where are the other two legendary birds? Articuno is in the right place, but Zapdos has been ousted by the fixed power plant
/me 7looks at memes.
moltres
7and I never bothered to properly explore Victory Road
7though I did find that Karate King bloke in it
7not at the right time, and now I can't find it again, but still
/me sets Hiker Benjamin on fire for having a geodude
JPGs with anti-aliased digital works, especially digital paintings are fine
They destroy pixel art, though
7oh, also, in Black and White, no pre-gen 5 Pokemon will be availible until after you've beaten the elite four.
03JPG the format is fine
GIGGLE GIGGLE MY NAMES BENJAMIN AND I LISTEN TO ROCK MUSIC, THAT MAKES ME RANDOM!!!!!
7all brand new
03but Paint just sucks at saving it
03other programs can do it better
cool
Exactly.
depends on the version of Paint you're using
Photoshop can save it really well
ooooh im bored
03No
the Win7-Version of paint is quite good in fact
03even the newest one fails
not really.
03Nope
03it's not
Win7 paint doesn't.
03it's exactly the same as the older ones, all they did was change the default type ton PNG
03>_>
03*to
Yeah xD
and make it shiny
and more confusing
03also EW THE RIBON
03*RIBBON
03^ more confusing, yes
03I got rid of it
03and put in the Vista one
i dont like paint in general
Paint is good if you know how to use it.
annndddd I want to know how to do that
|D
i dont =\
03well
03I like it for things such as print screen and paste
Oh yeah
03why open up some superbloated program like Photoshop if Paint does the same thing just fine?
because photoshoop/Gimp takes forever to boot up
03yeah
plus cropping is confusing in those programs
03and the one cool thing about Paint
you can't just drag the canvas to enlarge/make it smaller
photoshop is so confusing
03it automatically adjusts the canvas size
03yeah
Also, you can make anti-aliased lines in Win7 paint
xD
paint is better for cropping and resixing
03EW WINDOWS 7 PAINT
resizing
03um
03Paint cannot resize
gah cant spell
03only crop
03o.o
7Lag gone again.
It can
7Without quality loss, that is.
sort of
it can do it, but in a very crappy fashion
03how?
7Right click, stretch/skew.
stretch/skew
03If you change the size of the camvas
03*canvas
7Type in the percentage.
03that's cropping
lol
03........
03oh
03well
03that uses Nearest Neighbor
03EW NEAREST NEIGHBOR
that really kills the quality
7Or the control +/-
Yeah
03You know what I use to resize?
03MS Photo Editor. Included in Office 2000.
7What?
03Works awesome XD
ooooh i hate chatting on my phone
enlarging anything is hard to do without quality loss
03well duh
03EW UPSCALING
7Except vectors.
03vectors don't count
!apple
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPADS
4EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IMACS
vectors couldn't care less about your stretching shenenigans
screw this im going on my computer. brb
03Espeon, I know that, but vectors can't be stored as pixels.

03if you have a PNG, jPG, whatever, I don't care if it was *made* as vectors, it will be lossy if you try to upscale it.;
yeah
and something more: http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Humor/Workshop/C-Nail-Screw.gif
actually Quicktime isn't horrible
for playing videos
when I'm too lazy to boot up VLC or whatever
correct Tier - it's an ENTIRE DESASTER to play ANYTHING with it....
03EW QUICKTIME
03just use Media Player Classic
I mean - a media player needing even MORE resources than Windows Media Player?
I don't use it as my primary one xD
03Use MPC.
I use WinAmp for everything
03As your primary, secondary, and teridary
except DVDs
03WTF WINAMP
03Winamp is an AUDIO player
03it's not for videos
Nah.
it can also play videos drf...
It plays videos fairly well.
...lame enough
oooh i hate clones
7Wanna ask someone here to kill it?
But I use VLC for DVDs and movies and shiz
2yes
2please
2:D
03um
short videos I use Quicktime because I'm lazy
03I don't have oper here
and windows media player LAGS LIKE HELL
x_o
ghost it up
7Or you could wait for it to ping.
2i could
2=/
2i need to register my name
Icy!
2but i still cant figure out how
2ty
03I've been saying it
oh and speaking of this
2.-.
....why are the dugtrio's not mad in this version
D<
03stop making up rules
wat
03>_>
7o3o
lol WUT
7o_o
03>:|
03Stop abusing your power
03also
03RULES File is missing <- FAUIL
we have chat rules here
03*FAIL
and those chat rules are to be applied
enfore them - or leave
7Does it say we can't do whatever that person did?
03Show me the rule that bans filesharing?
03Hmm?
03Because AFAIK there is none.
03Stop making up rules as I said.
we have
read up the rules
03RULES File is missing
03Sure
03I will as soon as we HAVE them ;)
wassup!
03LOLwut
okay, that is just stupid xD
03seriously STOP POWER ABUSING
2i drew a picture of lugia :D you all should go make fun of it .-.
and you start reading
03http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
03There is NO RULE sayin gyou can't have file servers.
03-g
2lol
:D
03and his file server only shows if you type !list
2served
03That qualifies as a ! command and those are alloewd
2!list
03*allowed
03so as i said, don't abuse power.
Hi...
I'm cooking right now, gotta feed these kids....
2hm
2i dont understand this time differance
7'alo, Time?
oh ok
:o
I don't see a single rule in reference to filesharing
03that's because there isn't one
03and what 24 hour time?
03you mean like 16:00?
2yeeees
2i hate that
2it confuses me
it's simple
03yeah
7And attach a PM.
and makes helluva more sense than A.M. and P.M. imo XD
03well
2but im still in a different time zone
In Norway there is no am/pm so lolz
2and im notsure of the differance
03wait
http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
03GMT +/- what
Okay, back...
2eastern somthing
2@_@
LOOOOOOL
03WTF?
HAHAHA
03Stop making up rules
2xD
7:|
LOL
03I'll need to run this by Articuno >_>
that wasn't there
ever
until now
xD
7Do realize I don't find this funny.
03Just because you don't like file servers doesn't mean you can single handedly just create your own rule to prevent it.
Okay this is just silly <-<
03I realize that you have site admin permissions but you can't just do that without talking to the othper staff first
03-p
this channel is not for filesharing, was never and will never
03and you're the ONLY ONE who has an issue with it.
2poooower abbbuser
maybe I'm the only one not wanting a lawsuit against Arti and Xai?
03he actually talks on here
03and I've DCC sent stuff to others before, including Arti
03so that's a retarded rule.
well, he should decide
2why would a lawsuit happen against arti and xai
2...
03You can't just turn them off for a single channel
03it's either on or off
this rule is not negotiable
03and this isn't the only place he goes on
03Until I report you to Articuno for abuse, at least.
/me 7blinks
just because someone has power doesn't mean that they are always in the right.
7I trust DRF on this. o3o
2yah but
Same.
7-o3o
7:3
03also keep in mind that !list is a ! command and under rule 34 it's allowed
This IS Arti's site
i still dont wanna <censored> him off and get kicked :3
7Erm...
You guys should consult her
Before making a rule.
lol wow
Just imho.
SEE?
D:<
that was just the swear filter lol
oh
wb
did i swear?

03and you can just censor yourself

03I asked Arti about that too
2i diddnt know the P-word is a swear @_@

03Yeah, apparently in hte UK it is
03so now you know

my uncle and I both ate too much food for breakfast we both thought we were gonna throw up
2do i need to put the ! in front?
yes
I'm wondering if there was a backpack made that had spyro on it?
7you lead a very unhealthy lifestyle
7If you mean the game, no.
7ah
7If you mean the chat, yes.
7probably

7Try 'go' in the game.
2STOP SAYING THE GAME
04:P
I only base this on any band that has an emo/goth fanbase such as aiden and alesana, all the fans I see littered on social networking sites and forums where they talk about how much their life sucks and how much their uniforms suck and how every band that doesnt have screaming in it sucks
7What, should I type PUTPBAA?
THE GAME!!
/me runs
:P
/me 2gives chase

theres lots of anorexic people too

04I get the day off, but I'm starting to wish I didn't have this cough to ho with it
04go*
7you realise that goth people aren't english by default?
:(
04so I'll be afk most of the day in bed
/me hugs
oh
04nickalert if needed, and I'll come if I can
7Are you even playing PUTPBAA?
7that's like saying all sheep shaggers are Welsh
7wait no, bad example
that's the fun of multi-user chats, there can be over 9000 conversations going on

oh
there you are drf
it seems like it's mostly older adults who are obese
I don't see too many people my age who are
2typing eat killed my wife ad put mein a shoping cart in the middle of SOMWHERE
03yeah, I was traveling
7You can annoy the text parser, too!
I've seen a few
7Or waltz <noun>
well yeah, me too
2wtf?
far more older people though
but no where near as many
7are you sure they're just not hiding behind each other? :P
yeah
7Hey, over 200 endings.
wtf ftw
/me looks back
2I've just discovered that my mother is amazed at my capacity to not have motivation for anything
2>eat self ((you have annoyed the author)) author: yah F*** you too buddy
2wtf?
...
or so it seems
7Yep.
what the?
2this game makes no sence
2D:<
7If you want, type a swear word in there.
I would probably rather be anorexic than obese
7It has responses to that. :P
eat
...
I wouldn't
It's easier to gain weight than it is to lose it
/me holds them o3o
7The reply differs depending on if it's a harsh or not-harsh word.
I'd rather be full all the time than choose to be starving
was that a script?
2i dont belong with the adventurers :(
7that's not how fat people work
well true
7the more you eat, the more you want to eat
7It's not the adventure; it's the ending. :3
also true
but the reverse tends to be true for anorexics
fat people are hungry all the time because they're constantly getting fatter and need more food
7Examining southeast is weird.
7Typing 'up' less so.
the skinnier you get it still isn't good enough for anorexic people
2this game is....THE GAME
LOL
!thegame
they always think they're fat
/me tilts head in confusion
2im going to fight lex luthor
Well you always think you're fat when you're fat too
everybody thinks they're too fat except fat people
2FOR THE METROPOLIS
2but his magic missil of mayhem is coming
lol
FOR THE SWARM
2QUICK THIS WAY
2up up and aaawayyyY!
true
2this game wins
and they just keep eating
/me 2turns all the "y"s into gammas
it's really bad either way
lol
I'm glad to be average weight
7*** My god how embarrassing *** (Guess what you have to do to get that ending?)
2i achieved revenge

are these scripts?
7PUTPBAA, I repeat.

03right

necessary to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force."

03but seriously guys
2exactly
espeon said it
03no killing it intentionally
03or I'll make the bot ignore you
Yes, but I'm Espeon
7Now I can use it for actual purposes.
03I had it ignore Kyu for several months for doing that
2how do you kill it?
LOL
/me yawns for real
nini
still, I'm happy being one of the few knowing about the world's longest ROTFL-acronym

03you already DID kill it
lol
2HOW
03no defining acronyms you KNOW define swearintg
03*contain
2xD
So, basically, if you're in danger of physical harm, you can shoot to kill, if they come in your house, you can shoot to kill, and if they try to rob or steal something, you can only shoot their legs out from under them
03seriously, doing that is just idiotic
03you already know what WTF stands for
03so don't try to !define it
LOL
03I'm serious
it was funny the first time you gotta admit that
03you know how much of a pain it is to keep fixing it?
03Yeah
I know
03the first time it was
Huh, interesting...
Yeah
03but after that then it got stupid
which makes it unfunny now
:3
where does ROTFLBTCDICAJTTWADBSIHPWTRHITSBKABAYB have such a word in it, eh?
2i diddnt do it twice!
03like the over 9000th time people keep doing it
2i did i once
2D:<
lol
did what?
2by repeating wht i said
2and THAT killed itthe second time
03no, he tried to define a stupidly huge acronym

and
nothing happens
2*giggle*
when drf wasn't here
2NIGHT?
2what time IS it over there?
I still don't get the point how I should be responsible this very time for the bot being killed
3:40
7Because you're causing it, and you know it.
03But those other 20 times you were
2 3:40 AM?
PM
will you tell me how Quan?
2its 6:30 pm here

2TS?
erm, no Quan?
7Then?
may I suggest some reading goggles for you?
ya
7No, I mean before.
03ph
03*oh
03yes, before
...
2i did it the first time unintentionaly D:
03as you didn't know
03but now you do, so don't do it again or I WILL get mad
2oh
03until he started evading it to make a point
2ok
03I recently deleted my ignores.
funny how people get insulted for fun from earlier because a bot disappears because of someone elses typos
2i need to get to 5500 mssges so once everyone leaves im going to talkto myslf for3 hours :D
wonder when I'll be blamed the next time if the bot disappears...
03I only blamed you when you were the one who got it killed.
2Hello rip, hows it going?
Yes you will
/me ruuns
2good how bout you?
03I wonder if it's possible to set an exception for the bot
03so it doesn't get kicked on <censored >

04when you have no cards left in your deck?

2i enjoy talking to myself
2:D
2its nice
because if its 'at the end of the turn'
2no one to argue wth
2I KNOW\
then this deck is even more awesome
2il invent a machine that clones me
if I can survive that long
2then i can talk to him

04they lose

or in this case, less than 12 cards <.<;
I cleared the chat
04pfft Quilava i hate mill decks
I need to add cheap creatures with regenerate
04i hate them with a passion
2buti cant read it because of lack of loading T_T
cant be worse than cancel :|
04i'd rather face a cancel deck
04i mean they only can play so many cancel cards
04but all it takes is 2 or 3 cards to destroy your deck
2who is Ia the glacion and why do they wann be my buddeh?
04i'm pretty sure you'll beat me next game Quilava XD

It's a screamer.
2:(
6waaaaaa?

Pardon me a moment while I go get the Holy Water to exorcise the Demon of Intel Graphics from my system because of mention of the Name That Must Not Be Named.

In the middle of the game a picture from the exorsist pops at you.

I've a Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT in my current box.
PEDO NINJA!
03why do you think most hardcore gamers use nVidia?
6omg
SCARY SHIT!
03that's not coincidental
pedo bee
03also, ever heard of CUDA?
ewww
03ATI has nothing of the sort
My lap-fail-top has... I have no idea.

03that has nothing to do with NVIDIA
2i know not of everything you guys are talking about
03CUDA lets you use your video card's memory to do other things like encoding
lol
03thus saving yoru CPU from doing it
03it's cool

Idc lol
03I just don't like ATI as their stuff literally does not work
03ever

I told you!
03and I've tried a few on a few different machines.
(meaning Idc about knowing)
6nooo
03it also has no Linux support

Thats a screamer!

I have used ATI to success before.

03I've heard of it working
However... it was at that period when ATI was actually competant.
03but I've always had issues
2YAY WINDOWS 2
2:D
03like, on my desktop it rendered my computer unbootable
03the video card
Then they became incompetant. Soooo... "Hello Nvidia."

2xD
03LOLfinally
03I thought I was the only human here
7I have a Ninetales character, but that doesn't mean I'm a furry. O.o
I fully recognize I'm a human
However, I can be whatever I want to be in a chat
Yeah.
2ooo friskie advertisment
2"cat dreams do come true"
oh & thanks drf for thingy?
04the way i see it it looks like you have to drop in on a random game and wait until you have enough players
2there is a cat pouncing on my chatbox D:
03yeah np
7Unbanning, y'mean?
04i haven't really done this yet but i don't like just joining a random game
not really
03I'll have to bug Articuno later though >_>
04i like being randomly setup
7I have logs, if you need 'em.
just go to one of the ones at the top
that has 20 ish people
03so do I
04hmm
03and Mibbit logs suck
7Okay.
04mising the point
03it's fricking hard to tell what anybody's saying
i got killed & i dont have autoreconnect so i missed a lot =\
03I prefer <>s around names
a lot of people find servers that they love and continuely go back to
2i see perfectly fine
04i don't care about waiting but i don't like dropping in

03my mIRC logs do that too but they're actually in a format that if pasted, show the colors
03opposed to yours
03hm
2a flying alagator thingty?
2xD
03I guess that does work
7I could strip it in notepad.

It's different with chatzilla, too
03why does mine have two?
03that shouldn't happen .-.
2MY upsidown face

*select
12what about me?
12i'm always lurking
what about me?
03well
03honestly
03it's easier for me
03to just paste the logs in a PM in mIRC
03and then highlight to copy
03that strips colors

Garry's mod
Hello feather
7So... do you want a character? o3o
You don't need one
2deffinatnatly
It's nice for roleplaying.
7definitely*
2well mabey i WANT one
You'll stay sane as a Yuma
Human*
7Well, do you have an idea, first of all?
2i dont wanna be sane D:
Any one here ever play a pen-and-paper RPG?
7Or should we start from scratch?
I'm just myself in roleplays when I don't feel like being an actual character
Meeeeeee
04when you click start playing
04you are brought to a server list
2nooo idea
Because reading the GURPS Uplift source book, my namesake character is hilarious overpowered. :P
I'm helping start a Call of Cthulu campaign
<3
2cthulu
04ate the bottom half of the screen though
04what is that
04*at

You won't get anywhere irl and will be an outcast
they're two different things
2cathulu, ha'hoole

2ish
You can't even draw your character

...
Cuthulu
7o3o

7Back on topic, now:
That's how you say it
2i can very well draw my character if i want to
I say it Kth-ulu

7I say suh-thoo-lu.
They said it Kth-ulu in the Call of Cthulu silent movie, sews.

Okay
2guesst mabey i AM already an outcast in life D:<
I'm convinced you want to try
I under stand

2he is jealous
It's not like he's going to die if he does.

Just sharing a bit on my own experience
2he wanted to keep me as one of him
7So... Y'wanna be a Lugia? :P

03Yep
7Want something more unusual?
This is their gathering place
03we have too many Lugias
Yes.
|D
lolz
7But not too sueish?
I can't draw my character, or anything (other than things technical) to save my life. :P (However, there is more to artistry than just the visual arts.)
So what?
eesh
so many Lugias
What are you, crei
2i want to be different
2but somthing that everyone knows
2you know?

/me hides
Look up my character's name sake. :P

*xD
Yes
7What bats are there in pokemon?
(If any one is too lazy to go and look up whom my character is based upon, I can provide a drawing made by a very good artist.)
With the fandom, it's something else
7Or would you consider something more demonic, less batty?
It's worse
2zubat but i HATE tht pokemon
IMO
I'll leave it at that and you can ask her tomorrow
Later

My DSL upload speed is so blah.
04i see
04how many different maps are there
04i think i'm counting 10

Crei

/me hides
Harpsichords are NOT a combination of a piano and a guitar.
2you hide alo
2its piano
2.....tats plucked
I personally think that is the worst way to describe it.
2thats*
Especially to an actual harpsichordist.
2its a piano but it plucks the strings like a guitar D:
And especially to someone who knows it was invented BEFORE the piano.
2hay hay hay i kow that D:
So infact the piano is a harpsichord that hits the strings instead of plucking them.
2im taking piano classes
/me hugs Obsi back
2i know what a piano is and i know whata harpsichord D:
2is*
12i need to get that link a bow though D:

02it's basically all the books in electronic form from the 1-3 books
i'm rooting for blade
in that pic
and why the <censored> do I STILL <censored> HAVE IT
02Oh
02It's probably because I haven't really been into my U drive from the middle of year 7
ic
02I should delete it
yes
02o-o

it's a spider that looks like a cricket, but can jump like a grasshopper
:x
goodnight all
hi where
Uh
Proto
>.>
...
me beats his tab key savagely
Uh
...
/me does that
as in, /me instead of me'
>.>
<.<
nice, where xD
:/
Shouldn't you be in bed, Curly?
:o
I'm um... acclimatizing my body for my shifts
Murrrnapples :3
It's either way past bedtime, or nowhere near getting up time.
I see.
well, it's 5:47am, so that's not thaaat early
:|
/me forces Curly into bed
/me hits where
wat
It;s for her own good :O
You'll never get to sleep once the mean sun comes up[
and all the birds start going on about how lovely the new day is
I have things to do today :X
D:
/me pew pews the mean things
/me is going to apply for health insurance and go get her uniform and go pass resumes out
:o
Busy busy busy
:O
Very busy.
I don't like the sound my 360 is making with this cracked disk in it
:(
why are you trying to run a cracked disk? O_o
Because it's my only copy of modern warfare
Consoles don't spin them very fast
compared to PCs
where, I know
But it's got two noticeable cracks in it
does that disk even work? >.>
Yes
I should have taken it back when I first got it
My copy of Halo is like that, still si fine.
360 not explodeded.
when I get a proper job I'm going to buy a PS3 and a 360 and a ton of games :X
You mean a PC Dx
that's it
I'm buying a good gaming PC too
/me turns it off
yay
but there are console exclusives like 3d dot heroes!
which I really want
What is that?
But at any rate
one second
was making a *dunkita dunkita dunkita* sound
>Console exclusive
>really want
wat
Means it's only available on one console
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL3qVfemEp4
come on, you can't not want that!
Hm.
Actually looks okay
I want it
But can't afford a ps3 :(
Despite looking at 3 seconds ofit
I want Blazblue and Geometry Wars too among other random things
/me went outof map in MW2
/me enjoyed that
>_>
no clip ^^
I like how bullets actually push you back in the modern warfare (call of duty in general?) series
I know someone that doesn't like games like MW
because of how realistic the damage thing is
and how easy you die on veteran
why are they playing on veteran then? >.>
if you play on recruit it's easy
er, in general
MW is way harder than MW2
yeah
:o
MW2 had a harder veteran mode I think
On vet B)
I can actually not suck in MW2
Not for me.
all I know is I can't remember dying so fast from just gunfire in MW
/me remembers when he had a lot of video games that were current
I've never had a lot of video games that are current :D
I think the most current game I have is l4d2
this is back before my original xbox got stolen
what about Alien Swarm? :O
you can't not have Alien Swarm
I don't have alien swarm
it's free :O
On steam
which runs not well
on a netbook
It didn't even know what kind of graphics 'card' the thing had
lol
which reminds me of something that will always make me laugh
Off to bedtime now :o
people's reactions when I tell them we didn't have a computer until 2009
bye where
O_o
good night where o/
yeah, something like that xD
But that's like living in the pst, in the future, which is now in the past!
\:O/
I live in PST >.>
wat
couldn't afford one lol, so it was like living within your means
Pacific Standard Time :D
Is that a timezone?
Ah.
Nice one where
GMT-8 ^^
Nooo
+10 ftw
>:O
I just like the province I live in <3
Although it does result in me needing to be in bed now
And leaving Proto and Curly behind Dx
I'm used to being left behind
bye o/
seeya where
/me doesn't want to leave Proto behind Dx
It's never bothered people before
/me forcibly cuddles Proto goodbye then runs away
Don't touch me where
>:D
YOU WILL FEEL MY LOVE AND HAPPINESS
Okay, byee

12lol
/me scratches the back of her neck while playing her PSP
/me 6ra
12why so obsessed with females?
12i mean i understand snorunt

^
6?
/me shruges
6where?
on the forum
6I mean, we've had a LOT of problems recently
/me ras back at Aurora

most of the RCMs are members
sorry

whoa
brb
lol wut
o-o
6D:
12lol kyu is still a moderator for the RP thread
6but that's not an actual "mod" status
12it depends on what your definition is of the forums
12if in your little mind the rp thread is the forum and everything else doesn't exist
I'm not playing tennis today XD
12it can be seen as a mod
6well
6what I mean is that Kyu doesn't have a little thing on his profile status that says "RP Board Mod"
...
6normally it says Global Moderator
12lol
Cyndi?

2doesnt lati have her first day of school today?
12i got to leave to do a small task in 8 minutes
6most freshmen take geometry
127
2she said today was the first
6so that's not anything weird
yesh
6small task?
12getting the mail lol
6how long does that take?
12it's like half a block away
but I don't want to be with /those/ people D:
6k I dunno if I'll be done before lol
6aero, why?
6wait, just got my pal pad
12sigh lol
2aurora
they constantly mess around being a nuisance to all .A.
6CONFLABBIT
it annoys me so much. >A>;
6how do I get my own FC?
2i drew another lugia and posted it in the gallery. can you accept it? :3
Pal pad
6Aero, if you went into the algebra class, it would be worse
6trust me
oAo
6drf, yeah I know, but like....it says log onto nintendo wifi
shoudln't
wait
have you gotten a FC yet?
on that game?
2Ganondrf
2*giggle*
6no
that's why
you have to connect to the internet to get one
6well, for me that involves walking to the back of the house, but once I'm in range it'll connect?
yes
6*it'll connect the code
6I know how to get onto Wifi
12you have to log into nintendo wifi to get the FC assigned to you
6I just don't remember getting on wifi for the code lololol
6k
2Aurora
12hmm
6k brb
12kkkk

2:D
12lol
Not really
I failed calculus x.x
2:(
2its algebra
lol
2 4x-9=3+4x
um
that's impossible
you end up with 9=3
2i know D:
2thats whyim stumped
are you sure you aren't reading it wrong?
lololololololoooooool
as that problem doesn't work
2 4x-9=3+4x
2that exactly it
12no solution
then write "this problem is invalid" LOL
or that
2xD
12-9=3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V1gEjtmm9M&feature=related
2obviously -9 is the same as 3

interestin
*interesting
6ra
;D
2going to be the first thing i point out to the teacher on the first day of school
2@_@
6well, a lot of algebra problems have no solution as an answer
2im trying to figure out a puzzle though
6btw
2oh wait a minut
6chikorita's overworld sprite is derp
2one of the one of the solutions has an o with a line through it
12lol

hi guys
2hi

2:D
9x=3x-6
6x=-6
x=-1
2ur fast
2o_o
Yeah
that's easy compared to calculus >_>
2and my parents wont let me go on the computer because they think i never get any work done ;D
6lol
/me hides
6I go on the computer BECAUSE I know I wont get any work done

2ok, ok il do the next one
2lol
2oh shoot there is 3 VARIABLES
2WTFFFF
2U CANT DIVDE BY 0
correct
ur doing it wrong
2of wait
2nvm
6corr-
6dkuhfd
6:|
2its -3
2;D
12either that or once again no solution
2no
12i remember in class once
2no other ones can be invalad
2there is only one space for a fail problem
12our teacher gave us a whole bunch of no solution problems on purpose
6but they can be invalid?
/me 6runs
http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/90166100-8131-4a76-a6b0-1ae3a755c211.jpg
2i know but the puzzle is supposed to spell something
12yeah it spells no solution
2LOL
2unTrust bank
6lol
2-8+5x=3x-11+5x
2go drf go :D
/me has a REALLY crappy video card.
um
also
that's not 3 variables
12you know you should be doing this
Even the official website doesn't have drivers for it anymore. XD
:(
3 variables is like x+y+z=4
2not that one
anyway let's see
/me had to google it.
2i got the one with 3 variables
-8=3x-11
But it'll work, I guess.
If it ran CSS it can run this.
3x=3
x=1
2your good D:

2-13+x=4x+23+6x bet you cant do THAT one >:D
6XDDDD
6that's easy
does anyone know an application the lets you create animations? like: you draw a square, you can turn it brick, rubber, palastic, ect. draw a circle or fan looking shape over it, draw another small circle to make it attach so it doesn't fall, then draw arrows at the edge of the shape to make it rotate in place.
2shhh
2 hate the long ones D:
2i alwayse do a stupid mistake ;(
2i have one

dude
www.wolframalpha.com
type it in there
http://www.wolframalpha.com/
it'll do it for you
:)
14 18x + 27 = -36 - 27x - 54, so:
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9%282x%2B3%29%3D-36-27%28x%2B2%29
lol
<.<
Ive had that happen
2wait
2i can just imput a problem
Yep.
2and it will solve it?
Yep.
enjoy LOL
2JEZ
lol
2you could have given it to be b4 i finished the other 35 D:<
14 45x + 27 = -90, so:
2x
eh
well
2xD
I wasn't thinking about it
14 45x = -117?
also you should learn how to do it
2do you WANT me to do work?
you can't use Wolfram Alpha on a test, now, can you?
XD
lol? lol
no
14Sorry for being late.
2can so

oh snap
Don't make me get Cyndi on you! >=3
2this thing is amazing :O!
g.g.gah r.r.rape f.f.face
yeah
I use it for help with calculus
2does it work with everything?
14Make sure you can live without it on tests.
:P
2lolk
2multi-step inequalities?
14Well, it works with calculus, which is difficult compared to your level of work.
2pshhh
heres an example of what I'm talking about
14Here's*
lol
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I guess geometrically
/me shakes off the ice
14I used Geometry Sketchpad.
14http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interactive_geometry_software
14There's a list.
....... yuck
okay I'll check it out
ugh i hate glitches
Mmm, nintendo games.
14According to the list, Cinderella's one of the better ones.

2i just dont kno HOW to do it
Blah I should have finished the second book yesterday but my mind was on school all day
rise over run
or y/x
Good...
lol
man i hate spyro
2LOL
2this wont be easy
2im trying to find the slope and y intercept from a graph
lol
10WHOS MA MAID OF HONOUR?
14That's not easy? Owo
2i can draw the graph using text :D
>.>
14Do you have the equation?
2i hate maths D:<
2its a bunch o lines
2no equation
>.> im a guy
10nintendo is a guy
I know...
14Okay, the slope is easy: Find two points where the line intersects the grid.
urgh
not again
10he's not gay either
i keep dying
10on what level?
Oh.
10i can give tips
14Preferably at an intersection.
14Or in other words, find two places where three lines meet.
2 0,0and 2,1
Baby....
lol ya play that game a lot should be able to blast through it without dieing now especially with maxed upgrades
14In this case, 2 - 0 and 1 - 0.
10yeah
14Divide Y by X.
10Icy: what is it sexy?
okay um the application is more of a game
it's skabb
second time around
>.> earth flail spam attack

10lolWTF
2um
ok ... dragon time then ram him with it without mashing the button
finally
now i kill him
jesus
2lets use 2,1 and 4,2
2so i can see the numbers
10HALLEXHAM
next time i'm using dark spyro
DRF linked?
14Okay. In (2, 1), you know which number is X, and which one is Y, right?
10yeah
2what would be it?
10thats always best
2yah
2x is first
dark spyro = me killing him before even activating the battle cutscene before the fight
10god
2so 4-2 and 2-1?
see i used regular spyro
who sucks
10Icy theres alot of hookers on DS trying to get my number >.>
This does not even deserve a captains log >:[
14Yep.
http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/27085ffa-ee0d-4fef-8ff7-20de3d890411.jpg
LOOOL
Wtf?
2sooo 2, 1
14Now put those values as y/x.
10i know
2y= 2 x =1?
14Altogether:
10i think one might be planning to do me#
if It helps any this was on a laptop call Averatec
10ehh
at least skabb only has 1 bar
14'(Y1-y2)/(X1-X2)
the second time
D:<
14-'
2wouldnt it be the other way arund?
10i'll just cut off his dong
O_O
:O
14Y is 1, X is 2.
woah
2ok
da da da da damn
are you doing equations
14So what's 1 divided by 2?
10hey i dont mess around
2.5
2o_O
/me 10gets a knife
14Yep.
Why am I still on mistclan? lol
were it (x1 - x2)=m(x1-x2)
like the stick figures on crack
2so the slope is .5
10OMG
they say da da da da damn
CRACK!
10I LOVE THAT SERIES
me too
so funny
14Yep.
10oh have you seen Stickfigure Randomness?
I have!
10by Hopdiddy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9geRUp9Blw
watch this
10I KNOW ITS AWEOSME
stickfigure randomness 5
I remeber how to do that
2so -3, 1 and -2, 3
2give me a minute
2 1.5?
2or 2
14(3-1)/(-2 +3)
14 2/1
10YEAHH
Cyndi: Love you!
wait
10icy: love you moar
i love the laser penis
2so 2
CHUNKY!
14Yes.
(y-y2)+m(x-x2)
there
2i get iiiitt
lol
14Got it? 'w'
2thats easy _@
2@_@
14Great. ^w^

10BRING ME SOME SOUP
10what kind?
10CHUNKEH!
I'm sorry baby. :3
2what about he y-intercept?
10god you make me very aroused
14You see the X and Y axes?
>.>
2the*
2yah
lol
14When X is zero, what's y?
14Err, wait:
2 0
14Is it the other way...
!define y-intercept
chunky!
-!- In coordinate geometry, the y-intercept is the y-value of the point where the graph of a function or relation intercepts the y-axis of the coordinate system.
10HBEY
10lol
yes?
14Okay.
14So, yeah.
SHIT JUST GOT REAL!
10start puttin abut a dozen eggs in a bowl
10mix the FUCK outta them
10and whaddaya get?
10PENIS!!!!!
o.O
14Y-intercept = (0, y)
lol
win!
10it was in the video
2wher the line crosses hrough the y axis?
yeah watch it Icy
it's awesome
14That's why they call it a y-intercept. 'w'
I did.
hey dark
oh
2ooohh i see
2xD
hey nf
Epic.
10lol

10FUCK YOU YOU TURD
It's just a group. If she's so narrow-minded that she doesn't care about what input you give then there's absolutely no reason to stick around.
Soulja boy up in dis oooooooooohhhhh.
Couldn't resist. :P
=<
wow
random
2-3x+2y=6
6lol
2these are getting harder and harder T_T
Sigh
6for example, the biggest issue I've had
Wolfram Alpha
2same thing
just keep using it
cyn is nothing but random
14Slope?
6the featured folder of the gallery
2slope
2yah
10MAH NAME IS CYNDI
14 2y = 3x + 6
10YOU PATHETIC SLICE OF CHEESE
what ever
6when I joined, she had 4 images out of all the gallery in the featured section, 2 of which we hers
2then divide by 2?
random: definitnion: cyndi
DDQ
10SHUT YOUR FUGGIN MOUTH
6so I tried putting more in there so people could be recognized and such
14Yes.
10MAH NAME IS CYNDI
DDQ
http://chzoddlyspecific.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/9f039b72-84ee-4c46-b81d-fe3fe9d31902.jpg <- LOL
DDQ
10CYNDI
14Technically, there can be a coefficient before y.
DDQ
14In this case, 2.
10YOU WEIRDO
2so slope is 1.5?
6she got on my case about doing that, saying she had it organized exactly as she wanted it
DDQ
6i'm like >_>
dark
oi vey
dragoness
I'm still confused why you used the term "nazi"
Da Dairy Qeen?
13LOL

10lolwhut?
10who is dis you speak of?
i'm trying to play spyro
2its not in the answer box D:
Just kidding Cyndi.
darkdragonessqueen
it's sooooooo overused. Also once you refer to Hitler/Nazi's in an arguement you automatically lose it. It is law.
my mom
/me dies
correction your dieing in spyro
no
:D
14In all situations, try and get the equation Y = mx + b.
14For your work, so far.
i'm not dying anymore
6so I started suggestion other pieces be put into the featured folder, the OTHER group mods VOTED for these pieces to go in, she pulled an obama, vetoed our vote, and kicks all those pieces out again
14Godwin'!
10is that your girlfriend dark?
14+s
but the elemental dragon kept hitting me
2lol
6so we're back to 4 pieces in the featured, 2 of which are hers
Yup
and my mom was standing in front of the tv
....
while i was playing
10HAHAA
10lol
10epic lose

The only reason to stick around is if you somehow could magically ban her from the group just for lulz.
Which you can't.
So yeah.

/me yawns
2what if the y is negtive?

14Then the slope is negative.
2oh
14But if both X and Y are negative, they cancel each other out.

Because people can do as they want as long as they aren't asses about it. That's dA's policy in a nutshell.
DA is just stupid in general

2corse it does
6sigh
6I'm not going to comment to that
6but yeah that is rather irritating

6...
A sexy rock.
6watch who you're talking to
14Sure, and lose 60% of the people on TST?
I see nothing "wrong" with that group. it has a controversial theme, but nothing that violates dA policy.
10TELL EM ICY
10while i go hide
rocky is a cool name
yeah same
7you can use any color you want except yellow, white, light gray, light blue or light green
I mean there's people who fangirl over Josef Mengele, that group is totally normal compared to much of the weirdness on dA
amen
A sexy rock, who like being romantic....
10MEN
i knew a guy named rocky
10ehheheeh...
!define Josef Mengele
-!- Dr. Josef Mengele (16 March 1911 7 February 1979) was a German SS officer and a physician in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. He earned doctorates in anthropology from Munich University and in medicine from Frankfurt University. ...

2just like murder
I gotta agree though - hiding behind "freedom of speech" too much = pathetic. You gotta be able to back up your thoughts and beliefs.
how do u get pikachu on a bus???
what about this rule: "Your personal freedom ends where you hurt the freedom of another being"
10I wanna be the very best like no one ever was.
12I just think people shouldn't say offensive things, really
10to capture them is my real test
2i agree
10to train them is mah cause
shut up with the song!
10i will travel across the land
12There's no "need" to say what you really think at times
2just because you can doesnt mean you SHOULD
10searchin far and wide
14Don't we have a rule for such things?
god damit
10and so on
True, sometimes you should just assess the situation and stfu :3
shhhhhh
/me dies
good
12I don't see why people have to force their opinions on people, not everyone wants to hear it
10your just lucky i dont know the whole song
14 37. Religious and political chat is now forbidden due to people not being able to control their emotions. Many users have been insulted and flamed for their beliefs, time to put a stop to this. Make a seperate channel if you wish to debate.
12Lol well said
i do
ha
UGH forcing opinions on people
10 I wanna be the very best like no one ever was.
12But I have no idea what's happened here
10to capture them is my real test

I'm mad at people thinking making fun of millions of dead people is okay
6which I've seen a lot on here

12lol
Disney... >.>
yeah
lol
03o.o
6ok
6quick question
Punk ass decepticon.
i love pete's son
6left or right?
6ffffff
12left
lol
6well
6I did that
6raikou went right D:
03because of something
12What are you on about?
6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
03but I have never heard that in *legit* cartridges
6I went right this time, he went left
03This console is actually licensed by Sega
so uh
hi.
12?
Now I'm watching transformers...
12What are you playing?
6soul silver
6...
6lol
I meant the consoles
I thought you bought aa famiclone
12what bit?
12OHHHHH'
12YOU'RE CHASING IT
6beaten all 16 gyms, just tracking entei and raikou
6...
12I THOUGHT YOU WERE PLAYING WITH IT XD
6yes D:
6....LOOOOOOOL
6I wish D:
oh cool
12Yeh I think the tracking system is crap for HGSS, why didnt they stick to teh DPPt version??
6...?
6what do you mean?
12well in DPPt you can actually keep the map open so you dont have to open it every single time you want to see the position!
6what was different in the DPPt?
6oh
6yeah
6but it's not that bad
i'm watching taking of pelham 124
12aaaand
*123
12Yeh it is
03I bought a RetroGEN
6in GSC/RSE you had to check the actual pokedex
03Which is some Chinese thing that was licensed by Sega
12The Pokeymans are randomly moving rather than moving away from you all the time
12Yeh it's stupid
6they're never moving away from you o-o
6they have a pattern
6you just have to intercept |D
12Yes the pattern is that if you move towards, they move away
Thats the exact definition
!google famiclone
12You rarely ever collide paths
6not exactly
-!- No results found
one thing i like about hannah montana is amber and ashley are gone
>_<
6they have defined paths
12You can only move back and forward and so does the Pokemon
6that reset every once in a while, or if you fly
I know it's licensed but those things hardly even get looked at these days
6yeah, and quite often they're move towards you
03well
12Yes but they still follow the same pattern, like two piece chess
03Famiclone sounds like Famicom?
and I was refering to the sound chip being chep in that
03I'm talking Sega, not Nintendo
6which is why you fly again
7Chess, eh?
7Chess implies AI?
12They can move towards you if you are more than 2 places from them :|
6fly to mahogany, check map, fly if they're not near, repeat
12and flying puts them in random places
The term is coined to aftermarket consoles
12So are you saying that you fly each time rather than walk?
03oh
6arti, I've had them run into me
12Thats gotta be SO annoying
6arti yes
6I fly to mahogany
03!define RetroGen
03er
!define RetroGen
-!- No results found
6and fly to mahogany from mahogany
03:/
12I always do it by route borders
6it's annoying, but it works betetr than whatever you're suggesting lol
12Lol
"Warning. Warning. Airlock open. Throw the alien out, and shut? the bloody door"
12Ok I'll try that D:
o.o
6if you're just walking between routes
6yeah, you'll never catch them
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_hardware_clone
It's weird that the autobots kill two decepticons, that were only hiding.
That's good movie.
Cronker Live and reloaded/ Bad Fur Day reference
I'm bored :|
6I was pro at tracking latios/latias in RSE
12I sit on the borders and walk back and forth until they move enough for me to collide with them at one route change
12It's complicated..
6I purposely just ran into them and let them run just to track again
Who are they?
6arti, that stupid XD
Hello peoples
13backy
13backy
6flying resets their trail faster
12Well it's no wonder it took me two weeks to catch Raikou and entei in Crystal
hi all
6and it's easier to collide
6LOOOL
03hi
12I just found opening the fly menu was too much annoyingness
6like saturday night, I ran into entei 5 times, raikou 3, and latios 6
12Ok
6my only problem is I need to paralyze them still D:
13KABOOOM
12I use sleeps
12But my Victreebel is over level 43 now I think so I can't use repel anymore..
7How about Shadow Tag?
6hmm
6well
13how do you play?
6once you'e got them on your map
6why do you use repels anyways?
6I mean, you'll still run into them
7But without running into weaker other wild pokemon first.
lolwb
6and?
the girls who pick on miley and lilly
the black and asian chick
6so you run into a pidgey first
6you'll find them after
6its not like they run after the first wild pokemon match
12Guys?
Ahh...
Why are you here again? xD
6meh?
13yes
6...
7o3o
7O.o
10o.o
Just curious
12I think
6o-o
12I can't find it >v<
13what do you mean?
O______O
7You sure it's not a glitch?
13OO
12Pretty sure..
6quan
13da da da dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Well
6WAY too coincidental
12Guest
7Eh?
12Nope thats not a glitch
I mean, you're usually on TST, I rarely ever see you here
10Yeah, he deleted it
I saw what happened earlier
13don't look at me I didn't do it
10"Guest"
6that's going a little
6um
6childish
12FFS
6um
10Eh, he did it once before, with the competition thing
12I'm seriously annoyed
7So he got demoted and quit?
6it's not like we didn't need him....now what
12Yeh but he never deleted his entire account
DDDDDDD:
12Quan no, his position altered slightly
12He was still an admin
13well I actually forgot the name of this site and I didn't do anything about it T_T
Lol, really?
12Also before I even changed anything I asked him first, he didn't reply then quit.
13so that means he not an admin no more?
13true
12Well how can he be if he deleted his account?
12this is pathetic
13brb
Did something happen on TST to make you come here or something? Or did you just want to?
xD
13btb
ok
!pokemon !type
I'll see if I can get ahold of him on steam
10There's a way to restore accounts, right?
nou
he's online right now
12No
swimming skitty = bad
6skylands, why would that do anything?
12He permanently deleted it
10:/
6he'd just not come on even if it could be restored
12Then again I have the backup from a few days ago..
7Can you back up an individual account?
12Yep
12I can backup anything that's backed up
12:>
6lol
7Okay, so that's not too big a deal, then?
12Nope not anymore
7The account itself, I mean.
12His behaviour though..
10Back, but busy
7Did you have that mod chat?
6this is ridiculous
12Yes
6yes we did
man this movie is good
12He didn't respond, just quit, before I'd even done anything.
12Yes -v-
10*account
10Wow
I got ahold of him on steam
6watch him ignore you about this
6hey look, entei :>
6...
6ok
7O_o
/me forgot to mention that he left D:
6not to be rude
6but
6LOOOOOOL
Anyone want to say anything?
12Honor? What's this got to do with pride and that?
Maybe someone noticed.
This one is too.
6what honor is left when you walk away in such an immature way
!legendary
:o
but PM?
12I asked him a simple question, "Would you prefer this?" and he didn't respond so fair enough I guess
7Wanted to go out with a bang.
6nothing had even happened, he just simply ignored us
12I sometimes wonder if he's really nearly 30 years old..
12even though I've met him in person lol
03LOL
03TK, PM.
transformers?
Hai! :D
Yeah...
/me just got back from skinny dipping :3
Rotf
lol
man everyone's gone
k
7Eh, you can look a different age you are. :P
Someone do something
6ok, well
7Betray? O3o
12Lol Quan I've seen his passport :>
12Anyway my mum wants me to ring her, bbs
6he's got the stupidest outlook on "honor"
And everyone else who's always quiet...
yeah
!define honor
-!- award: a tangible symbol signifying approval or distinction; "an award for bravery"
6how is completely ignoring us, when we were trying to talk to him in a civilized way, honorable?
7No, not quite: that's the noun.
6if you want to be straight, he lost it ages ago
13backy
13backy
a spyroforum member
12one of the forum's moderators
yep
0!legendary
Yep...
6loss of trust, he should be in here to keep him from losing
7:|
6*it
6but you knwo what
he left at that moment
0oh Ya that fits me so well
6he lost my trust forever ago
6so
6I don't really care lol
10same here L/
10*:/
I assume that he'll quit the steam group now
03OK WTF
03This RetroGen console comes with built in games
03Some of those built in games also don't work right
03WTF
7I wouldn't say he was untrustworthy; on the darker side of moderation, yes.
what u up to?
13so why did Timy delete the account
I was going to ask him if he could really accept losing all the work he put into the site
o.o
but he left
12still getting owned in muramasa.....
7But then he started using his power in other ways than intended.
03anyway brb
10k
hey do u have new beginning?
6he lost my trust when he went around using his powers defying what articuno had set
I do
12yeah

/me shrugs
03I love how people assume I'm some leet haxor because I know how to use IRC
03The way Mibbit works is the part before the @ is the person's IP address in hex
03just convert it to decimal XD
03and reverse it
03though the hostmask has the IP in it o.o
Hm
Remember the last attack on your server?
/me blinks.
03o.o
13ya but you did create an MIRC
03I just swallowed a piece of pencil lead
03I hope that's not bad LOL
/me 13runs
13and you know how to hack
03no I don't
03I can only hack the computer I'm using
03not other people's
I do.
03and heh, yeah, the portable mIRC thing, but I didn't make mIRC LOL
03I just modified it to be portable :P
Do you remember the date?
/me gives this computer to drf
Mod talk.
12now hack it
12D:
13and you can talk type and do something else on the computer at the same time
10late but
Hi Ecco~
13hey Eccy
/me checks.
hey Aero and everyone!
04i want to bet money Quilava will beat me next game lol
03<Misty> and you can talk type and do something else on the computer at the same time <- LOL
03That's easy
03I have two monitors
Should be a long, long time ago
03and hm
03unless
03Is there a way to see all the IPs that person has used?
03as she might have used a public computer, a school computer, etc
13LOL|
Aww, lost RCM
12well
12whowas
12but that was too long ago
13I can play a poke song chat and fly at the same time
10I searched 24.1.21.217 and it only shows logs of a guest with that ip
10no members
03odd
03well I'll give them another chance
10ok
13whos that?
13hey Alty
12i'll give you a hint
12you are breathing him/her in right now
One IP is from Illinois, the other from Tennessee
13Air?
lol
13okay I am chatting on 4 different chat site now

Ahgh
10lol
Hm
10not a good idea on #SW
13and The PokÃ©Community
Inb4 DRF says something
03EW HOR
045 seconds passed after a mention of HoR and people haven't descended into an argument about it
XD
04wait nvm
10meh
lol
may on HoR?
12lol Misty
lol
Well, Purplesurge is being DoS'ed by someone
get banhammer ready
Which we know who
03XD
13WTF
12i read that as "Okay i am chatting in 4 different languages right now"
10also Altair
12honestly
Am I good or what
XD
04lol
10I'm want to speak with you privately :P
04drf
13Sky you've been spying on me?
04question: what do you have against HoR
We didn't.
Sure XD
Altair; well
The server Z:Lined every bot before it even connected.
Lyon
Eh, doesn't matter.
04?
at least drake said that it'd be 5 seconds :P
10GAH I gotta go
10I
10I
10GRR
04yes Altair?
...bye Feather?
04cy
Bye Feather
04cya*
bai Feather~ O:
They hate HoR for no reason
10I'll be back around in around an hour hopefully
10XD
well they have a new reason maybe
I wouldn't even ask XD
XD
03<Lyon> question: what do you have against HoR <- Hasn't that been asked over 9000 times?
04lol
04nope
unless I've just gone past their minds XD
04not to me at least
04I mean
04I've been silent about my opinions on TST bashing HoR, but I'm getting real sick of it
03what is the POINT of HoR? It's just another TST that people started using
haters gonna hate
eh, I'm not so sure how this whole argument between TST and HoR happened, but I'll sit back and watch O:
04it's a place where people can hang out and discuss Ho-Oh and other topics without getting bashed by the community or being flamed
04I mean
*is thinking the same thing as Aero*
03Nobody bashes people for discussing Ho-Oh here
04pfft
03Honestly I don't care what PokÃ©mon you like
03I'm not a Lugia fan either
13brb
13no bbl
lol ok
13bbl
kk
04anyway
04if it was 'another TST' we'd be all over Lugia and Arti
03I just mean it's just another PokÃ©mon fan club, just aimed at Ho-Oh instead
03which is dumb
03you can discuss ho-oh here, nobody cares
04so?
04there are millions of Pokemon fan clubs on the internet
03and seeing as how it was inspired by TST anywayl...
03-l
03yeah but not ones started by former TST members
Altair; everytime it comes up
Yeah
apperently we get the hate D:
loldramatime?
04actually, there is alot of flaming of Ho-Oh on here wgenever we try to talk about it, which is why there hasn't been any discussion about Ho-Oh here
Yup o3o
12i'd assume one thing is that it doesn't have some people who come here
04but you know
04nevermind
kimi no mune ni la la la...
04I know I started this
03after seeing how awesome TST was LOL
04but I think I'd better stop it now
lol
12heh
loldrama
12i'm just saying that some people would probably like it if they didn't like say for example.... Lyon
12they could to go HoR and basically have the same TST experience then without that one person
HoR has other members from other sites, however the majority are from TST
so another lulz fest? XD
12i originally went to HoR because i felt like i was going to be ran out of TST because of someone else who still comes here
12but as far as they knew didn't know HoR existed
lol whos ddosing
Termz
12a single person can make a big impact on a community
03well
^ times 100
03I know people who go to HoR only because they know other people who don't use TST
03which is like
03they used to go here
03then they switched to HoR
03and now they brought over people with them that ALSO no longer go here
03they're fricking stealing our members
/me runs
XD
03it's just like
03if everybody was on both that would be fine
03but people leaving TST to go to HoR just pÂ¡sses me off
whos that
Some people there have never heard of TST
03I know
03that's not my problem
03in fact most people here haven't heard of #pokemon-originals either
12drf also sometimes i tend to think being more popular
03but the few people from TST I told about it are still here
Just get the host to setup a hardware ddos filter.
12being the more popular community
12is a bad thing, it's something i've hardwired into myself
We never made HoR to be that way :P
12i guarentee that HoR probably gets less 10 year old trolls than TST does
Granted, TST has at least one per month on the forums alone
..oh god
7Well, expanding community.
Happens to all sites
there was an episode where Ash turned into a pikachu?
that grow
04wat
12Hor will most likely get there as well
The server doesn't seem to be lagging.
12but for now
Not anymore
Look at this idiot http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=1900598
Most likely not, we don't really advertise it much anymore
some moron is posting in my thread

bullshitting because he coulnd't scam
me
oh look animation fail
10Duh
12doesn't matter
04we're happy with out little tight-knit community
12the bigger it gets the most likely it's going to be a top pager for google searches
/me misses TST of two years ago
10^
He doesnt understand that i will not sell to him
two tokepis
True lol
Anyway food
12guess what
12googling for ho-oh realms
12*i mean googling for ho-oh
12ho-oh realms is on the first page
12:P
04lol
12just barely lol
Report him?
03* Altair misses TST of two years ago <- that's because of all the n00bs we have here now
/me hides
03also in case anyone is into classic Genesis gaming
03* Altair misses TST of two years ago
03er
7So is TST for Lugia, Glacy. :P
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGhm8R9QySg
7But higher.
03Stupid clipboard
04ohyay
Send a squad of ninjas to his house?
Yeah... I kinda miss TST from when I first got here
04now we're getting into who's higher on Google
7Articuno as well.
04wonderful
7Who says we're arguing?
Nuke?
04did I ever say arguing?
12that is my wisdom
Hydrogen?
7Touche.
Large Hadron Collider?
12Lyon in case you didn't notice
^
12i was supporting who didn't get as much hits on google :P
Small Hadron Collider?
Wouldn't do anything
12the less popular a site is, the more pure it remains
7o3o
04true enough
Would be easier to transport
Still
12Lyon
12pokebeach's chatroom
12literally bans a troll every day
hmm
12lol
10Try Serebii or PC
commercial for the blackberry torch
12serebii are trolls
10It's worse
12so they don't count
/me hides
or touch, can't read very well
7Question; how will TST deal with people like that in case?
the slidey one
12Skylands i heard serebii is really bad
12but i never checked it out because i have no interest in going there
10It is
12i stay in pokebeach because i like talking online with people who have as much tcg knowledge as i do
10I signed up there back in 2009, only stayed for a week
10That's how quickly I soon despised it
12anyway i think it would be in everyone's best interest if this talk of communities is dropped
12who agrees?
12i leave my closing statement as "i'm neutral"
10The silence speaks for itself
12hmm silence does speak volumes at times
12honestly though i owe a lot to TST
12and will do anything to help it grow
12however too much growth can be a bad thing
I lasted for like 2-3 weeks on Bulbagarden
7I thought we'd stop this discussion.
7Let's talk about...
hi QUan
*Quan
7Hi, Aero.
:)
7The weather?
hot
and sunsetty
I had some Rocky's on Friday... I can't get enough of it
12to not just eat
You still do?
12but to play pokemon there
12XD
7Hot, but dark.
12pokemon and pizza nothing is better
12yes i do
12last time i was there i didn't even have any pizza i ordered a chocolate milk XD
Well that's understandable. But I go there like twice a month, maybe thrice
12once a week is hard enough but every day?
Yeah... it's probably not as appealing as it sounds.
12I probably wouldn't get tired of just rocky pizza
12i'd probably just get sick of pizza in general
brb

Ah.
it's 6pm
what's up
Okay.
what happens if you don't use ur final fury on Gaul?
Convexity i mean
you can't beat hiim
i know that
i mean what does he do
I don't know I never tried
like Cynder uses her own fury on u
I assume he just sits there until you use it
someone told me his eye shoots u
but idk
thanks anyway
lol
how are you btw?
Hey.
I think I remember that.
The first time I beat him I didn't realise what to do at the end.
10back
I'm good
His laser eye just pushes you off the edge, I think.
12wb
10thanks
f
yeah it says on this FAQ for the game, his laser shoots u off the edge
thanks though prince
:)
i've always wondered since i always use fury
only time i waited was facing Cynder
and her fury kills u
13a Drakrai
13awesome
Yeah....
/me melts
Yeah what?
Yeah....
No...
Love ya Dari.
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
Hehehe
prince dari, i was saying in the cynder fight, if you don't use ur own fury on her, she kills u
Why would you not?
i didn't once
i waited
lol
More interesting than Gaul's laser eye, at least.
i was asking what gaul does if you wait
on ur fury
now i know
That part with Gual was kinda pointless....
Over from the beginning.
darn
that's messed up
I remember being po'd about that.
with Cynder u start from that part
wish there was a video of gaul doing that
all the videos ppl use fury and don't wait
04whee i don't feel well

14honchkrow <3
10<333 yay
14I've fallen in love with the thing
or are you a big fan of another series?
I'm searching for assistance.
I was once one of the biggest Spyro fans.
I ran Spyro Fans Anonymous.
About six years ago I began that forum.
I'm the guy who created the SFA... as far as I know the first successful Spyro forum.
If you didn't get the last message because my internet crapped out.
14...
14peered
10o-o
o3o
Ugh.
Internet fail.
o.o
wb
ANyway.
I think I got most of what you were saying
Okay.
your searching for assistance?
Yeah.
<(^_^<) KIRBY DANCE!!! (>^_^)> <('.')> (>O_0)>
See, after leaving the Spyro fandom in 2006...
I came upon a PokÃ©mon wiki.
Bulbapedia.
Uhh... D:
I currently am in charge of that wiki.
/me puts some pants on then, unless he is reading the last one wrong.
XD
o.O seriously?
I check bulbpedia all the time
its pretty awesome to be talking to a big shot of that place :D
/me curls up and sighs
-_-
you still there?
Yeah.
I'm TTEchidna.
I should go to sleep too
/me pets Kitten.
ok
Wakin' up at seven XD
:o
Most absolutely. I have a Typhlosion.
/me pets Kitten too
hi..
I can prove it.
...If I catch my alarm
What's up?

:O
14ew early

14roara and her bloody appointment :|
14....literally .-.
Kitten lies. D:
10._.
Duh.
Hi

10I have school
10but I want to stay up a bit longer
Now allow me to reload.

There we go.
10me too <3
Okay so anyway.
SpyroWorld had a wiki.
so you want to get back into the spyro series?
Which died.
Where the hell did it go.
NAH I PREFER NOSTALGIA.
:o
10I should have had this book finished yesterday (second book) but I had my mind on school all day :|
I'll keep my old PS1 games THAAAAANKS.
they just never continued after dawn of the dragon
sadly..
...sadly?
SADLY?
10And today too
:o
10only a few chapters to go
The end of the LoS series is the GREATEST THING.
I liked that series >.>
Because that fuckup of a canon reset is OVER.
hi :3. i think i found an escape game u might like
/me loves her Lugia bookmark
CANON RESET SUCKS
Hoenn was awful.
:D
it involves shooting and no time limit :D
ANYWAY
some kind of spyro game needs to be made
Regardless of my disdain toward the LoS series.
don't want it to go down and disappear
Remake of RR, make Elora hot.
..Ooh. XD
Anyway. I likewise don't want it to die.
Which is why I wanna help the Spyro wiki.
I need to know what happened to it.
I need you guys to bring it back.
http://www.addictinggames.com/escape.html
it's easy!
except the gun fight >_>
happened to what? the spyro wiki?
/me failed it
I only started getting into the spyro series earlier this year
Yeah.
I don't know a whole lot about spyro but Ive been collecting various games
The one SpyroWorld had.
been working on a spyro collection
to collect every spyro game ever made
Get Ripto's Rage. It's hilariously 99-style.
even the different versions
I'm about half way there
Ive got about 20 spyro games so far I think..
Hmm.
...20.
why does Kitten lie?
might be around that
I have to recount it
/me knows Kitten is upset. :o
but yeah they made so many damn versions of the games
o-o
like spyro a new beginning
Controling my computer via ipod
they have xbox,gamecube,gba,ds,ps2
its even harder getting them in black label
Ah.
Ports.
yep
Hmm.
I just barly started playing riptos rage, I beat the first game 100% a few weeks ago
Hmm.
Ive got the collectors edition atm
need more spyro games :D
/me pets the Kitten to downset it! :o

/me is upset?
Hmm.
*Rimshot*
I don't get it o.O
On BP, you ever edit?
nope
I mostly just check out the news
I saw the charizard article sometime ago
makes me regret selling my card all those years ago
04>>
I have two.
One hidden deep in my basement among my most prized cards.
/me can't figure it out. :o
:O
what part are you on?
are you still stuck in the cell?
Yes. :o
nicee
I think I have the pikachu card from the first movie
I never completed the set, I'm missing maybe 20 cards from the original 151
do you have the coins yet?
I always think that one of these days ill get back into collecting them
the silver one goes in the sink
and the gold one you used to unscrew the toilet seat
there is a blanket under the bed
and a nail on the side of the bed in the wall
and a watch on the dead guy along with a bible
I need to head off in a bit, do you use any IMs? maybe we can talk on there next time :]
or here if you want
Check out my userpage on BP.

Alright
It's either blue green pink or green blue pink.

/me already got it
lol i didnt have the key :P
Ah.
wow the spyroforum backup is a 250mb file.
:o
hey
i have one more chip :/
/me coughclockcough.
lol not that one
nvm i found it
it was the blue one i didnt have
Ah.
now that code..
It's gotta have something to do with the clock and watch.
that's what i thought but... i dunno
anyways TTEchidna the wiki is back up, http://spyroworld.net/wiki/Main_Page
Ah.
What happened to it?
and also, why are you around?
I turned it off for a while.
People were kind of pissed at you.
Why am I around?
Do I ever leave?
It's been four years since I killed SFA>
I know, its been a while ago.
And then joined Bulba.
whats Bulba
Bulbapedia.
And Bulbagarden in general.
what is that>?
I have no idea what you are talking about.
anyways, why are you back into the spyro fandom?
Oh its a pokemon fan thing.
By the way, what did you want to add to the wiki TTEchidna ?
/me 's mind wants to click walkthrough but his pride says NO.
lol
..
/me emocorners.
>:3
No, go make me dinrar, bitch.
>:O
:3
OOOoooOOh
anyways im going to bed, ttyl.
:O
Nooo
Later.
/me falls through the ground.
But as for what I wanted to add...
...as Bulbapedia head I have a proposition.
Recently, we along with several others launched NIWA.
An alliance of independent Nintendo-based wikis.
Yep.
You guys and SonicRetro are two non-Nintendo video game canon wikis that I know are good, independent communities.
/me wonders if that is significant
inb4 fail
Bible, watch, evidence, shampoo, shotgun, chips, key.
open the bible
/me noms, looks, reads, washes, unlocks, shoots, uses.
in that order.
what are the numbers?
/me -_- would do it herself but i accidently clicked out of it..
/me thought the same, but there are 5 altogether.
93:2 and 3:11
..
6 digits.
My bad.
Anyway. I'll be out now. But you can go on and bug me on Bulba,
hmm..
Can I ask what exactly you two are doing?
I think it's something to do with the "NKJV" on the cover.
You may not.
/me kids.
hmmm
It's a game.
An escape game.
ESCAPE
RUN
FLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I see.
FLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
/me spams his esc key
/me has to do this crap all over again
:)
nini everyone :)
Bai :o
/me huggles a pillar.
/me huggles back
nini
/me is too sleepy for this..goes for the walkthrough and prepares a heavy facepalming.
:O
/me got it
..
Wat.
The walkthrough 404ed me.
:o 9260
..How? :o
remember the chips?
put them all in then take out the red one
then go to that ventilation thingie
and it shows those numbers
it's in the link
the numbers are part of the link
Interesting end. :o

\:O/
/me casts Unexplode on Curly
XD
/me unwatches the universe implode
oo
I just had a though, I'm sure I heard it somewhere else, but it just suddenly formed in my head
/me huggles the Curly, after summoning a pair of pants.
/me huggles back
Go to a public toilet, and start peeing into the occupied urinal next to you
o_O
...
And yell at the other guy
DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS
...
xD
Anywho.
that sounds like a good way to get punched :p
or knifed
It'd be so worth it.
around here that'd get you stabbed
you should do that and record it :O
O_o
lol
voyeur?
I hurt my hand
I know
I'm just warning you
people get stabbed for all kinds of things everywhere
So I'm not most likely to get stabbed
Or shot.
hey hey
I didn't say shot
well, being shot in Canada is unlikely
Or whatever things they let you carry around.
drunk people don't have good aim
/me yawns again
half a liter of coffee isn't helping :X
:O
MOAR TEA
that's a lot of coffee
mmm... that's a good idea
Also, don't die or anything Curly.
/me goes to boil some more water
but if you do, can I have your stuff?
why would I die? o.O
well you can have my organs :p
yay
o_O
/me is a registered organ donor
:o
Nice ^^
as of yesterday :O
:O
/me could go for an extra two kidneys
That's another thought that made its way into my head just then
anyway, tea~
Although i'm sure I didn't just come up with it
my head huts
hurs*
hruts*
ihwpgeh*
LOL
ERIHA:LkHGIREL:KhnGEhgrlhr*
you know how at parties people often fill the bath with ice to keep drinks in?
ice and salt and water O:
Well when someone passes out drunk, take off thier shirt, and draw big red lines next to their kidneys
and put them in the bath
Seriously, I feel like I've been kicked in the head
best way to keep your drinks cold ^^
>:3
Tylenol no help
:|
/me pew pews Proto's head problems
Thoughts on my idea? :p
I think you'd have to worry about them dieing of hypothermia >.>;
Well.
Yeah.
But *if* they didn't
Imagine their face when they woke up
Classis.
They have horrible nightmares for the rest of their lives
classic even.
And probably trust issues
still a terrible idea :p
become a shut in for fear of being attacked like that for real
your face is a terrible idea.
/me slaps where
:3
:(
:(
:(
The gal who promised to call me when she gets back did not call me D:
Maybe she's not back?
And she will leave for some other city in about 18 minutes.
I doubt that.
Dammit! Alone again!
Yesh!
Also D:
/me round house kicks where and follows it with two spinkicks.
does she have a cellphone?
Yesh.
But we were supposed to go for a swim and it is already too late for that :o
Midnight skinny dip >:3
oh
I haven't gone skinny dipping in forever >.>
O_o
I did that yesterday and the night between Saturday and Sunday.
what?
I've never been.
you should try ^^
lol
:3
I think I'll pass
I don't know how though, could you show me? >:3
/me jokes.
mainly because I hate how I look
so meh
lol
/me imagines Proto as the phantom of the opera
I've never gone skinny dipping with other people >.>
lol
No, where
Makes sense. :p
I have never gone skinny dipping alone D:
:O
Not like that, I just hate how I look, I'm not the lamest villain ever >_>
lol
Are you sure about that Proto?
Yes
Oh.
._.
Yeah probably
Dx
/me thinks Proto is pretty villanous.
/me sets Proto on fire
/me is warm and toasty now
:o
/me hands Proto a cup of tea
it's Earl Grey ^^
:o
Thankies ^^
/me sips
Is it a good kind of it?
I personally like it
Cos if it's not it tastes like pencil shavings.
I WANT EARL GREY!
I think the company was called Twinings or Tinings
Twinings Earl grey tastes like pencil shavings.
in my experience.
/me cuts where in half with the pencils.

it was time for them to run a mile
and I had to use the bathroom

I noticed the door was stuck
and I was like
"Oh, you guys think you're cool, trying to lock me in here?"
12:D
6LOL
so I rammed all my body weight against the door and sent them literally flying backwards
and was like "Never try to lock a fat person in a bathroom, it doesn't work"
/me 6LOL
well then one of the other kids had to use the bathroom
and I took the other 3 and just pushed them in the stall
and put MY weight against the door
and was like
I'll only let you out if you promise to behave
and they were like OK fine
and I swear they were prolly scarred for life
:D

5Hi May, Glacy, Roara, DRF. :D
5xDD Tab fail.

12no drf, they have chicken
12:D
5And DRF, seriously, you dun like burgers? DD8

Correct
i don't like hamburger meat
12it's a sandwich though
or steak
5DDDD:

12i love steak and burgers
12but i think chicken is still my favorite type of meat
6I
6love
6fish
12or turkey
I like fish too
12too much mercury :P
5I like hamburgers but not steak.. But I'll sink my teeth into a big fat juicy burger any ol' day. Mmm... (Call it the curse of Nebraska lol. We love our BEEEEEEF.)
6turkey is most definitely not my favorite
/me glomps May.

6but I'll eat it
6you know what's bomb?
6Unagi
/me is glomped

6freshwater eel
6but I just found out that unagi is on the MBA's "do not eat" list
EEEEEEEEEEEL
/me foams

/me steals some heat from Ari

http://pokebeach.com/2010/08/photos-of-tabunne-basurao-darumakka-from-bw-demos-next-corocoro-details
/me bites Curly.
6ok quan
6need your help
its hot here also
/me steals some heat from DT too
I need noms
/me goes to make some
/me pokes LightLie!
Thank you, Curly :o
And hello.
ffff
7Yes?
7Whoops, lag. Bear with me, Rora.
black and white looks like the same old evil team and collect gym badges
6lol lag
6you have that a lot
6:P
6anyways
6what's the deal with suiguno
7Okay, lag gone.
6*suiguno's head
6that head feather, the big one
12hmm
12brb
7Think of it like Suicune's crest, but vertically.
hey
6so it's connected on both ends? or is it a feather connected only at the base?
/me is considering going outside... D:
I thought it was just the middle crest feather in the shape of a suicune crest
so good news :O
my mother is paying my money back >.>
6dude
6dude
6due
6jfbdgkr
$70 a month
6dfkbhfgdh'dfh
6d
6tj
6dy
7o_O
6TMs will no longer expire after one use
what
wow
O_O
that's actually really good
I am surprised
me too
6anyways quan
6is it like that?
hi hi
oh a sky
lol
6because that looks like a pikmin, not a suicune crest
/me hugs may
/me is hugged
/me mews
7Well, I've never given it too much thought. I always just kept the tip out of sight. :P
:O
7Would you like a definite answer or interpret it?
/me steals some of Curly's cold
6I'd like to be as accurate as possible
6so explain plz
7Okay, then.
6woah
6just had a momentary happier than ever moment
6felt really good 8D
7In that case, it's not a single feather, but a crest. It's like Lugia's in this case, then, attached both ends.
7And my grammar went boom.
6lol
6so
7Or you can think of it like Articuno's crest. :P
7Same idea, except with a hole.
6it's basically like suicune's crest, a bone with a hollow in the middle, only flipped around to sideways version?
...
6or is it not bone?
Wow
6yes bone/not bone matters lol
A bone.
Lol.
7You're not Suiguno's creator, Sky.
...
6you don't even know what I'm talking about lolololol
Lol.
7Well, it's hard, for one.
Suiguno creator?
6suiguno is quan's fakemon OC
6quan, hard, so it's solid
6cartilage then?
Oh...
7Sure, let's go with that. :3
What?
7Feel free to stay out of this conversation, Sky.
6ok
6got a sketch line out
6lined
if you steal my cold does that mean it's even more cold?
Why should i i am on this chat Quan.
6and for clarification, quan, your sprite has two tail feathers, and the interpretation is 3
6so either there's 2, or your third one is hidden in the sprite
Nuh uh
7I gave it two, since Suicune had those two tail-ribbons.
Well
More accurately
6k thats what I thought
/me gives Curly some of his heat
Articuno, are you there? O:
he needs to take it with a multi dimensional wormhole
7And Sky, sorry, but the conversation doesn't involve you.
then it will be replaced with warmth
7But if you want, you can draw Suiguno as well. :P
6lol
/me hopes the heat will melt away the clouds
...
:D
12whee
6wow
6.....
wat
6Arti's online, I'm not the one who asked ._.
Oh lol
o3o
6but she went afk a while ago
ah, okay then
Aero
6Hmm
/me pokes
6I'm happy with the perspective on this one
/me flails
7Okay, Rora. :P
http://images.onlineuniversity.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pokemon.jpg
roara
both of the sprites she made have two tails
fanart is never accurate you know
6yeah did you see my comment down there?
6may I know
6but it's a heck of a lot easier going off a bigger reference
6I was checking for accuracy as I always do
7Yes, I noticed the comment, and the reply. Any reply to that, then?
/me dies
6see
6I even agree with that statement, espeon
6!espeon

6and every single time they've been removed
6one person was banned lol
6agk
6quan

/me dies

6one has white, one dark blue
7Ah. Hmm...
