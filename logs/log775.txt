I like a lot of things @_@ metal, dolls collecting, plushies, etc.
metal and doll collecting? I didn't think they went together
I am a collector too
Dude, metal and My Little Pony was not thought to be very compatible.
then again cute ponies and grown men didn't go together
Yeah, defining yourself into a stigma seems kinda dull.
^^^^
^
I know a show with cute ponies
O_O
but ponies ARE metal
yes
listen to that!
Ponemetal.
...
yeah well, also his name in the corner B)
The only pony related song I ever made is very much not metal xD
That detail on the headphones. *swoon*
But I listen to a lot of metal now. Fall and winter is metal seasons!
Even some Gorgoroth if in the mood.
Hm...they sound familiar.

Saturn: How not?
Saturn welcome in club
08,01anyhoos, i think we'd just get into another argument about whether homosexuality is immoral and socially destructive or not
it's not
08,01all our arguments seem to lead there, for some reason
Animation porn right here <3
Saturn: The fuck would bring up homosexuality?
TARTAKOFSKY BBY <33333
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: that's the thing; i have no idea!
08,01she thinks i'm a damn dirty gay, maybe that's why
GENNDY, you're awesome
08,01and maybe the fact that i *am* a damn dirty gay is why i don't let it rest...
Bye guys :3
Saturn are you ? xD
Saturn If nothing helps, get some distance from her for a while and try again a few weeks later..imo
And yet when Women and girls watch boy shit NO ONE CARES
Saturn: um being gay doesn't make you damned or dirty
Bye :)
Bye themon-gone >.<
Saturn you know, you cant teach anyone tolerance
allo y'all, more jack eh?
Saturn: a'ww that sucks man :(
I really dont have a issue with "gays"
It says ''Go back''
yes, you really let the Visualls speak, and it was good :)
08,01otakon: actually, according to quite a few religions, it makes you damned, and let's just say i can implement the dirty part myself
oh, something wrong Saturn?
08,01ekips: well, that's the plan; but see above
I hate religious crap...
Well there is nothing wrong with religion
/me is religious.

Well, touche...
Nyahh see
08,01*gasp
PHIL LAMAR <3
08,01*grasp
Saturn: lol nice description
Saturn: Sonds like half of america

R.I.P. MAKO!
08,01Kandarihu: well, you're right about the first bit, wrong about the second
R.I.P. Mako........:'(
Wait Mako died?
When?
Mako :(
08,01i'm not actually out to my parents
during Avatar
;(
back in 2005 or something
Damn
yeah feels bad man
R.I.P. Mako.
Died of old age?
R.I.P. Mako...wait, Mako? He was in the TMNT movie!
Iroh is gone
...CGI one.
Wait, whos Mako..?
CONE!
And truly, we're inspired
08,01ekips: thanks man
Saturn: Well, I hope you get through as fast as you can, dude.
Oh..
Oh..
same here Saturn :D
sorry I know that was random
lol this one
08,01until then, i'll solve my problems with laughter, alcohol, and pills
me too
08,01maybe two out of those three at a atime
Saturn: dude leave out the pills man
Saturn I approve of the first one
aoooooowww
Aku dollars?
it's Mos Eisley
Just cafe for me
XD
08,01Slumberwatcher: wait, leave out the pills but keep the alcohol? isn't that a bit hypocritical?
and the music too
08,01well, maybe not hypocritical... but something like it
Saturn Everytime someone spits out that argument to me, I tell them, homosexuality helps decreasing overpopulation
Saturn: Depends on the pills
play the same song!
Besides..isnt there a thing called adoption?
Any one else getting a Star Wars vibe from this scene?
08,01ekips: being indian, you'd think she'd get this...
08,01oh boy, that made me laugh
...Jerk fish
asshat
YOU SPOILED MY TEA!
ORLY?
2 googooplex
Saturn in that case, reproducing is the only reason of existence (at which point we could get into an whole other argument) , and in this age, noit reproducing is not that bad :/ you are actually doing a little benefit to the planet
The fuck is a googooplex?
1 million googooplex
All the googooplexes
Not sure of canaries do
googolplex folks, not googooplex http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex
DAT SWORD.
08,01AJIsAwesome: oh don't worry; i'm not suicidal
Saying the only point of us being here is to reproduce, doesnt that make us just animals?
how much is a googolplex
XD
and she just keeps dancing
THIS SONG!
oh look,it's Chewie
lol, tiny
Awwwww.
tiny wookie
Baby Chewie!
chewie
yeah, dis you
08,01i just prefer popping opiates to drinking alcohol; it's arguably less damaging anyway
AAAAAAAAAAAA
Leeeroooyy!!
Well, reproducing is certainly not our only purpose, but it is a good thing.
Saturn: I sortof have a problem with caring too much for people.
Oh damn, not the hat
08,01i'm touched that you care
/me hugs Saturn.
Ohhh right
My bad.
But text-intensive images seem to be okay.
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: want to make a racist joke... want to make a racist joke...
Hah
lololololooooooo

Please tell me this is the only episode of this anime you're showing tonight.
Considering how massive those wings were when they popped out, there probably should've been a lot more blood. O.o

Rozen Maiden is good too
Not as good as Haibane, but few things are
Rosario+Vampire has a terible anime.

First time watching this. Hm.
Roserade > Rosario
the manga of rosario+vampier was good

The Rosario manga is great, I did not care for the anime at all
13debating pulling down haruhi from my archives while this runs
I suppose I logged in at a good time, huh? :)
Haruhi?! YES, PLEASE
I've never seen Rozen Maiden.

Oh dear

It dun load. :<
Oh wait there it is!
Refresh, it worked for me
basically
Humens?
Hi everyone.
/me noms trout
I am a girl. I just got really drunk and puked.
actually
To know.
am in a bitchy mood right now.
Want a hug?
That's too bad. :<
I do want a hug. D:
Saturn: wut?
Only hug you'll ever be getting.
Aww. *hugs*
/me eyerolls.
theistic deities
]mo I want more hugs from you in the future. Just putting that out there.
its looking good
*hugs Gold*
.-.
Fine.
actually
What's wrong, Mojay? D:
08,01when other people are present, he is a stuffed animal
She wants more hugs in the future.
08,01but Watterson has said that he is neither "imaginary" nor "magical"
Twilight is subjective to facts that she can replicate and analyze right?
08,01he is a literal manifestation of subjective realities
I hate being this drunk. Mixed drinks are eebil.
:)
08,01from other realities (everyone else), hobbes is just a stuffed animal
05...
Why drink in the first place though?
05my RP senses are tingling
Just nooooooooooooooooo.
I just lost control of it is all.
Because, you know, judgment and drinking.
I submit that there are forces that are beyond our understanding at our current level of knowledge :)
At the end of the day they can't both be right though Saturn
I'm really drunk and it really really sucks,
uh huh
Daaaaabiii~
flafi <3
<3
or as MIB put it
08,01that is to say, belief
Ewww it
it's a stinking dabi
It really, REALLY sucks. I was sick and it as was chunky.
08,01anyhoos, that's just my take
Bitch please, I wouldn't even touch you with a 50 feet pole.
foot*
No, I've just been typechatting since the nineties.
I can still type coherently. But slowly.
foot, feet, toes, hands, fingers
Nose
agen u touched dat 50 foot pole last nite
;D
Well whoopdie doo.
You have no pole.
Living alone sucks. I want a hug irl.
Saturn: MIB :)
08,01ah
08,01hahaha
08,01that just sounded adams-esque
Just doesn't really make sense to me
I was just sick but I STILL feel awful.
The point of view at which you look at it.
08,01remember, belief doesn't need to be justified by objective reality
Wth man.
08,01if such a thing exists
It's 9;30 in america boy
10:30 here
Oh goddess whatever.
08,013:30pm here
08,01prince-dari: exactly!
^
Oh wow I feel like I'm going to be sick again.
NOW THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL!
08,01prince-dari: yes, but everyone believes differently, right?
... a'www
This is pretty awful!
08,01which itself is telling
that's all there is to it
I fffff... I'm not drinking any more. This is stupid.
I don't want this to happen again.
Energy drinks, from now on. No more liquor.
08,01we're talking about the difference between scripture, subjective belief
08,01otakon: exactly
Liquor is really really bad.
08,01prince-dari: yes, i guess i am
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
fosters home for imaginary gods
Spiritual rather than physical
No, Ryunwhatsit, I'm convinced liquor is really bad.
night all
Ehh, again that seems to be as though I could say "that square is black" and you say "that square is white"
It can't be both
.-.
05of fuck
05hit maximum layers for the image xD
why would they make a layer limit?
I'm gonna be hung over now, I just know it. And it's going to suck.
08,01anyhoos, i've gotta go work now
08,01see y'all!
bye Saturn see you later take care
cya Saturn
Bye Saturn
by they i meant the programs developers
Has anyone here been through this>
This is why I came here.
I want people to relate to me...
Ahahahahaha
Has anyone not been through it?
by the amount of light that is absorbed
I have had something to eat, hence getting chunky when I got sick.
I haven't been through it cause I don't like drink at all.
fgt dabi
And went to heaven
Then would that not mean he exists
Not just for me, but for everyone
I had way too much Lambs 151.
If I died, and that was it
Nothing
Would that not mean he doesn't exist
For everyone
He might exist as an idea, a belief, fine
or u were nughty
Even though you're poor as lel.
But imaginary friends are also real in that sense.
hey guys
welcome to the debate
hmm
Well I sure got sick.
Good. Keep at it
This isn't my first time round the block, guys.
I came here for compassion. >.<
loladvice
;~;
:)
lol
You're own fault
Ahahahaha
05prince-dari: or stop roleplaying
Well hey you guys have been throug h the same thing, you know how this feels.
That works too
XD
compassion.exe not found in internet/bronystate
05yeah
I feel really crappy and I just want a hug.
Grow some balls.
05dont complain about drinkign untill you've been in a snaps contest
I learned not to do it again :p
>_>
05see dari?
05roleplaying
People feed you shots. It happens.
You're lightweight Dabi.
Bitch please
I've never been drunk.
Lightweight.
i dont even drink
Ugh. I'm not a lightweight.
Cause you're too young child.
ahh
got it
lol
Just beer for me from now on.
Cause I don't like alcohol.
Durrr.
and actually IIRC, Vi isn't even "German" she's Austrian(sp?)
But I've drank a wine cooler in about 10 minutes
well... I wouldnt say just beer
Let's get a fucking beer bong in you and see who's the lightweight
but take it in mderation :)
Bitch please.
05sad thing is
and not all beers are the same :)
05prince-dari could probably out drink me
Has anyone here actually DJ'd?
05but id like to give it a shot
Drinks are like, on the house.
I swear people feed me drinks just to see if I mess up.
05definetly
05also dari
05check stream :3
To be hones tyou only need that one rule otherwise it's ridiculous
Checking, sec
I never want to see another shot again, this is terrible. Even worse is how many times I've thought the EXACT SAME THING.
Now for sure, NO MORE.
ew dabi
I have literally no idea how you do that shit
not in here
Just energy drinks now, that's it.
i want
I'm a girl, not a dude....
It's fucking crazy
And it's working again. Just needed to get off the page for a bit

Thanks for talking to me, guys.

Oi
is tht pony wearing socks
And yes, she's wearing socks
:O
:3
i wear socks
is socks canon
Don't you just hate it when the curve won't cooperate?
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF SOCKS ARE CANON?
last ep made it canon
how did pony wear socks
I think they are, since it's just about everywhere
Didn't Rarity wear socks in the Too Many Pinkies episode?
Real ponies actually look relly weird wearing socks,.
The socks just highlight how freakishly skinny their legs are.
I'd like to draw my OC wearing socks but I can't seem to put it on paper for some reason. It looks awesome in my head, though.
I don't like Babs Seed because she was insensitive to a donkey.
*on
Babs Seed is a bitch.
She did at the end of the episode
I hope it lasts
It should
Since the bullying thing was just temporary
Um.
Just a thought?
"Too cool for mules" *donkey* "Oh well FML"
Mule ≠ Donkey...
is play on the phrase to cool for school/ to school for cool
yeah I was thinking that, they're kids.
Might
huge emphasis on might
but probably not on screen
dat mane
They're special talents involve being spoiled brats. =P
their*
6 dat grammar fail
I thought you were going to sleep .-.
Their special talents are being over-privileged.

Yeah I should get some sleep.
