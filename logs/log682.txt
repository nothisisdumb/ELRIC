The creator just flat out dropped Terraria.
OH WAIT
DARI

Saturn: he trolls people, like in one episode he rode around town throwing food at people
It's fun.

Idling on TF2 can come in handy sometimes.

cashieoh-wan, plss
wouldn't it make more sense to have it gradual?
:D
00,10so is the rest of the world still useing that crazy metric system too instead of useing standard?
and metric makes more sense too
Milk bags are the best system ever
00,10dafak is Imperial?
the "normal" systme
00,10you meen standard
I'm sitting around
maybe right now it would be.....9 feet and 8 inches
As always...
Imperial is inch, foot, yard, mile, etc
This SHOW man THIS SHOW
Same
Just sittin here
*hoofs
08,01imperial is scky
no one else from any other company
I use a weird mixture of both
it is called 'imperial'
Large distances imperial
bye guys mothers at it again
and Namco is also that kind to showoff
and since Pacman is their mascot
but our imperial measures are different to US ones
afaik
Really?
or I change my name for Pinkfluffyunicorndancingonrainbows
yeah
Gooby , Dolan, Soba, kaibi, ribu, mansex
Well distance is the same for us and them in imperial, surely?
because it standardises everything
no, US imperial differs in several ways
him*
08,01except that imperial distances are *wrong*
which is why people prefer SI (metric)
it standardises everything
Saturn: wrong how?
bye guys
08,01Fersure: because everything should be in SI units
Saturn: I agree
Oh snap
but living in the UK means having to use imperial
I just use MS Paint
It's to basic
08,01twilight_sprinkle: wrooooooooong!
08,01like a wrong thing on wrong day
08,01on the planet wrong
08,01in a wrong competition
Well, inch, foot, yard, and mile are the same for America and England
anyone got a good pandora station i can listen to?
Saturn: but if it were a wrong competitions, then it would be right for it bto be wrong
all this talk about measuring systems is making me hungry
08,01prince-dari: i already do
300 and 600ml
You guys
Are fucking weird
are sensible measures for beer
GTFO
considering a pint is 568ml
NO U DABI
then don't drink milk
But milk is best drink

little bit of polish is needed
but this is working
lolhalo
Spacepunk?
dam right HALO FTW :D :D
Still has that sci-fi look

Halo is a milked franchise that needs to die already.

Same goes with Call of Duty.

Oh, jeremy soule worked on morrowind didnt he

i was wondering
and skyrim
this sounded very much like tes music
ikr*
Point stll stands, needs to die.
NVIDIA!
Halo was good, but it should have stopped at 3.
^
dam right they do y get rid of him
ODST/Reach was just stretching it.
But they had to tie in all the story lines for halo
ODST was bad
reach was a very polished shooter
ODST was boring
didnt feel like a halo to me
ODST had its charm
I personally stoppping liking Halo at the Halo 2.
^
reach was cool i still play it on my xbox
ODST reminded me of Halo 1, cause you could die easy if you werent paying attention
nop
whats you gamertag
Guns of Icarus?
