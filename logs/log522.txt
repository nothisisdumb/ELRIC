Uncheck
Best anamation ever
pinkie pie has just experienced rejection
Felt ftw
04Unlike Pinkie and the rest of Ponyville, Cranky has actually experienced the rule world. This is why she can't understand him and his bitterness.

its fucking foolproff

oh god, the B movie winner just put do a reroll for B movie
/me hugs Shamroc and Deceptive_Cadence back :D
0,14I'm checking
00,10right then rerolling then
Deceptive_Cadence: Uhgs!!
00,02having trouble finding a movie called reroll
Also, Spirits WIthin is NOT a A movie
/me uhgs Deceptive_Cadence back
0,14nope, nada
not in any sense but budget
11,01I think he didn't want B.
00,02suprising, thought there would be
04I think he was just messing around :P
Oh and Moo SB64
I would watch a Derpy Movie.
11,01Yeah.
I changed my nick to this for various reasons
Otakon, why so buttmad over Spirits within?
Mostly because of the pun
SaxyPretender SuperBrony64 Luna we respectably ask that you reconsider the A movie.
00,10we have 20 DoublePint who picked Tremmors
11,01Sad to waste your fractional chance of winning on a joke, but good joke nonetheless.
04Tremmors?
The B movie doesnt even have a plot summary on IMDB
Tremors with Burt Gummer?
yeah, but it's SPIRITS WITING
04Like that one movie with Kevin Bacon?
RX-78-SweetieBot: Oh, it's a terrible movie.
11,01Tremors?
Freefall29: it's Tremors
00,10yeah
00,027.1/10
I kinda agree that it doesn't seem like an A movie
I ask that the A movie be kept
04Nice
I thought it was hawk jones?
04Haha, Kevin Bacon
04Oh boy
00,02Australia!
05,1588% on RT
00,03AWWW YEAH~
No one could find it Freefall29
no, they couldn't find that one
0,14Tremors?
0,14UYES
0,14YES
I've seen it, its not terrible.
11,01Yay.
00,10sounds like a keeper to me
so we get Clerks tonight
11,02Moo ^-^
0,14FUCKING HELL YEAH
05,15I'm so okay with this
hi SuperBrony64
05seems A but hmm
00,03I'LL TAKE IT!
ok. thanks for clearing that up. :)
0,14it's a B
RX-78-SweetieBot: no, please no it's boring and long
04Hey Bacon! You're gonna be in a movie next week!
TREMORS
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/ <-- it's got Burt Gummer!
So how come we aren't even showing the randomiser this time?
Tremors! Hell yeah!
however, B movie is good
00,02"Tremors is basically a landlocked variation on 'Jaws'"
0,14CHILDHOOD MOVIE, HERE I COME
11,02I VOTE TITANIC 2 FOR MY A MOVIE
Seriously, we get paranoid about not sharing the result list so the answer is to hide everything?
Meanwhile: no idea, that's why I'm calling shenanigans
00,02dat movie
0,14TREMORS FOR B
05SaxyPretender: ah so you have seen it and know? neat
otakon: so is Legend of The Galactic Heroes.
1,11Tremors is a great B movie vote.
0,14THANK GOD
RX-78-SweetieBot: what?
04How much budget did Tremors get?
0,14I love that movie, seen it a lot
doesnt Stop LoGH from being the best anime ever though
this movie sounds interesting
11,02Reconsider the A Movie? Why?
00,10133 Null, with Read It and Weep
still, SPIRITS WITHIN PLEASE PICK SOMEHING ELSE!
05$11,000,000 (estimated)
SuperBrony64: bc that movie is crap
SuperBrony64: they are buttmad
00,03Meh tier~
05Gross:
05$48,572,000 (Worldwide)
04Oh wow
Mmmm Beer.
SuperBrony64: it's super long and boring
I knew they'd never find a copy of Hawk Jones. It barely has any votes on IMDb, which means few people have seen it, which means there aren't many copies out there
Because it's not an A movie.
11,01Yay Rainbow Dash ep.
05,15Tremors had a high budget. it may be A
SuperBrony64: it's like 2.5 goddamn hours and UTTERLY BORING
I agree. Not an A movie
04Well, we should decide here and now
:I
hawk jones. if it doesnt even have a summary, someting is up
Hmmm. I guess I'll have to change my pony episode pick since Read it and Weep has been picked.
0,14it's a B
I'm with ota on this one, SuperBrony64
00,02there are a few people begging us to reconsider the A movie
0,14a well done B
00,02i say we keep it
11,02It's a high budget movie, therefore A quality.
I vote we keep the A movie just to see people rage next week.
05i say we keep it too
04And a few people say a reroll is in order for A
05its tagged along movies like eight legged freaks
05so its awesome
05but B
It might even hit WMC.
04But
05awesome but B
04But
Did we decide that being shit wasn't enough to make it not an A movie?
SuperBrony64: PLEASE NO! This is WMC material, IT BANKRUPTED THE STUDIO THAT MADE IT!
04Tremors was an excellent film
@superbrony64: High budget doesnt automatically mean A movie
00,1077 Whiteheart who picked a two partter of Friendship is magic part 1
So, we got a poor A Movie, and a good B Movie. Sounds like Business as Usual here.
04MUCH better than all that other crap after it
RX-78-SweetieBot problem is you wont see people rage, you'll see them sleeping
0,14still a B
11,02Keep the movie, it makes everyone mad. /trololol
So what's going on with the lottery?
05,15it's a combo of budget and response from the public and critics
SuperBrony64: PLEASE RECONSIDER!
04But the budget
also hi
04I mean
04Really
0,14it's a good B
Ulthane: Im okay with that too.
04If we're doing budget...
god i hate beaurcrats
05the room had a high budget
00,10So we rerolling A?
fluttercry: horrible reviews, budget KILLED the studio that made it
Exactly. Boring bad is not as fun as cheesy bad
EspyLacopa: I know. how Clerks is a B movie is lost on me. Production value?
Bronysith: who doesn't.
00,03No, just keep it >_<
We've had to put up with shit like Spider's Web and Babes in Toyland.
congress has a 5% approval rating man
Freefall29: other beaurcrats
PLEASE NO!
04Well, Silver would probably say to reroll :P
RX-78-SweetieBot then i better pack my pillow and blankie
11,01KEEP THEM PLEASE.
11,02But honestly, it has a high budget and as listed on our qualities for an 'A' Movie, it can be a movie with a high budget for the time. $127 Million is pretty high for 2001.
04High budget and all that jazz, hehe
goddammit they're keeping it aren't they?
0,14Waterworld had a huge budget, and it sucked iirc
05,15From what I see FF had a high budget and decent reviews
1,11actually, I side with ghosties here.
00,10tick tock.
otakon: They did :(
05,15decent as in passable
fluttercry: no, it didn't have decent reviews
I just got here, what film is being debated
fluttercry: it was just a PRETTY PICTURE THAT'S IT!
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
1,11High budget, high gross, a good plot that's not a parody. The only thing that makes it a B movie is that it may have a cult following.
FF spirits within.
fluttercry: So did King Arthur
Frankly, I think they should mix them up
Don't tell me what to do, Derpy!! DX
11,02"A Movies are your typical high-budget Hollywood blockbusters; the “good” films. Big names like Lord of the Rings or Inception, or highly acclaimed films like The Goonies or Serenity. We rely on critic reviews and the movie’s budget during a dispute, but movies good enough to qualify for the A Movie slot are generally obviously so."
00,10and we have to restart the video =p
RAWRity: i'm not so sure really
RAWRity: FFF Spirits within
Make FF B and Tremors A
otakon: most people didnt like it because it wasnt related to any specific FF game.
Ictiv: better, but just RE PICK A!
SuperBrony64: This one is not obviously so!
which FF movie was the final adaption of FF7?
so automatic butthurt.
Final fantasy?
In fact it's obviously garbage!
05ok so its A.
OH FUCK NO
11,02"high-budget"
04Would you consider Kevin Bacon an A star or a B star?
RX-78-SweetieBot: well, that and teh boring characters, plot AND stupid concept
advent children was good
05switch places on A and B movies? :P
Bronysith: it was fun
advent children. that one
1,11Never seen Kevin Bacon.
should I see it?
otakon: Believe me, I REALLY would love if they would take my A, but that's hardly going to happen. And if they repick A they'll repick B too
gosh darnit
RAWRity: PLEASE TELLT HEM
Advent children is terrible just like FF7
Seems ridiculous to start kicking out movies now because they're too shitty.
05,15We could just switch them
1,11...
RX-78-SweetieBot: but I liked FF7
1,11There's an idea.
04Didn't Spirits Within get a much higer budget though?
/me shoots RX-78-SweetieBot
Oh god don't be lazy and switch them, please.
04*higher
00,02127 Mil yeah
04wow
04Yeah, haha
04Much, much higher
PLZ REROLL
PLESE MODS JUST REROLL A!
FOR MY SANITY
PLEASE!
1,11Yeah, but it got a piss poor critical and user rating.
So... donuts or moon pie?
05well its apparently meh so jsut a thought :P
otakon: it and ff6 and chrono trigger are all tied
Agreed. Reroll please
Only final fantasies I liked are 1, 6, 9, and 12.
11,02Alright, let's consult with the Magic Conch.
otakon: for my fav game
11,01It was computer-animated, so it sure did.
Just do us this small bit of justice and redo the A movie.
Which should I eat?
I dare you though, to play the MLP Movie instead of FF:Spirits Within.
04But Silver, you said you didn't care for critical and user rating
00,02i say we keep discussing it while the channel is muted :P
For the lulz.
RX-78-SweetieBot: at least \you didnt say 13
Randomnerd: Moon Pie
04That only budget mattered :)
05animated movie... might aswell count out the biudget
I know earthbound is not that popular. but i LOVE the franchise
Randomnerd: moon pie to honor Luna and LunaTheBeloved
EspyLacopa: played that already.
Freefall29: GREAT game series
05CG*
Can't decide... Can't decide... BRAIN ANEURYSM!
05w/e
11,01I say we discuss this in chat while the movie is going on.
Didnt even care to try FF13 since they went back to shit combat.
Moon Pies are the best things
And it was hilarious to be a part of the audience during that.
otakon. you played all three of them?
Randomnerd: LUNA PIES!
00,10lets put it this way, it bombed so bad square used the software to make porn movies to recoop the losses
04Well, you can discuss it in chat. I'm watching Clerks with the bros
Okay, that's three votes for moon pies.
I ate one on my way back home actually....
What movies got chosen?
00,02Sumica, srsly?
00,10yep
0,14eeyup
11,02$11 Million is a B Movie
00,02lolwut
Freefall29: eeyup, although I played fan translations for Mother 1 and 3
11,02$127 Million is an A Movie
05we cant take it to chat. we gootaa roll stuff
Wow, Sumica is full of interesting trivia
Bjornfot: they are debating A, B is Tremors
actully mother 1 was offically translated.
Bjornfot: FF Spirits Within and Tremors.
0,14Spirits Within punched Square in the financial balls
Freefall29: yeah, but never released here
The movie sucks, but it still qualifies as an A film.
there was a retranslation that did a better job at it
/me gives Moonpies to Luna and LunaTheBeloved
What a conundrum this is causing.
Can't the fact that it sucks be used as a reason not to show it?
1,11I say we switch them as the A and B films.
RAWRity: automatic WMC due to it being broing as hell
I mean, it cost more to make than most of use will accumulate thoughout our entire lives.
11,02Final Fantasy was an awesome game series (especially 13), the movies have got to be just as good.
Everlasting_Joy: quantum conundrum
I'ma eat mah moonpie.
05I agree
A Final... Fantasy... m.. NO, NOOOOOO!
Feh. This is hardly going to be the first time the A Movie was bad, and the B Movie was awesome.
/me hugs Randomnerd and noms Moon pie
Get on with it already, and choose the pony eps!
07,01*noms on them in a corner watching the discussion in mane chat*
They chose the pony eps.
SuperBrony64: YOU TROLL! NO ONE COULD LIKE FINAL HALLWAY 13!
05SuperBrony64: thast like sayign the doom movie was a perfect adaptation of the game
00,02SuperBrony64, LOGIC
SB best be joking about 13
We're just trying to get this infernal movie out of the way.
he MUST be
horrible game
Mind you, SuperBrony64 has terrible taste anyway. So that's unsurprising.
00,10wait so we are keeping both and you all are just argueing the tags? lolwut
only good thing was it was "pretty"
otakon: which gamE?
1,11The high budget gets kicked aside when gross, critic rating and user rating all slam it back down to B movie status.
really ? i only see fight about FF
like Spirits within
Bronysith: FF13
otakon: ABOMINATION
Meanwhile: He has MW3, so I'm inclinded to agree with ya
11,01Movie-based games tend to be terrible.
I heard FF13 was terrible
00,10we can move on if that's the case
it was
Freefall29: i dont count it as final fantasy
05seems like we are keepign both sumi
it's really a bad game
1,11Nitt: and vice-versa.
so wait whats the A and B
I can't wait now to see the reaction when my A Movie finally gets picked.
Oh thank god for Silver.
the plot makes NO sense at all
11,01Yep.
I was away during the lottery, which movies won?
00,02restart the video again?
1,11SO!
SilIsh_Bob: It's still being debated
GabeMoist: Still being debated
around 8 they slowly began to do different stuff... no more turn based battles. very linear. press X to win. ext
FF13 is best FF imo
1,11Tremors is A movie. Final Fantasy 7
GabeMoist: Final Fantasy Spirit Within and Tremors.
1,11is B movie*
00,10we are not going back to the days of 30 min intermitions
04We'll go with that
THANK YOU SILVERSCREEN YOU MAGNIFICENT PONY OF A MAN!
Bjornfot: then your opinion is wrong.
Ah fml they're being lazy about it.
Moon pie and Rolling Rock. Hard to believe some people spend like a hundred bucks to have this much fun dancing XD
05,15So we're flipping them?
00,10it's not ff7 though
1,11if we can find them. :P
/me molests RAWRity
okay, flipped
I can live witht hat
Oh my god
1,11Sorry.
00,10right then unmute it then
11,02Super Mario Bros. was an awesome movie though
still
All dis Spirits Within butthurt
00,02SuperBrony64, :<
1,11XD
Deceptive_Cadence: IKR?
what are some underrated but awesome games
Bjornfot: at this point, it's like throwing a hot-dog down a hallway
Where was Gondor when TAKE YOUR SPIRITS AND SEND THEM TO THE MOOOOOOOOOON.
11,01You're all thinking of Advent Children.
.
Next time we do intermissions, I'm going to the gas station. :B
00,10SB shush let the big pones talk
fuikvasjfijer
That was soooo longer than 10 minutes!
SuperBrony64: idk
YAY
So what is with everybody and having colored chat?
Freefall29: Advent Rising
11,01Moon!
11,02:<
huh
Freefall29: Alchemists of Al-Revis
omg non colored chat!
05firstfags will die
its like a rainbow
What was second pony episode?
About SuperBrony64's joke about Final Fantasy 7 questioning the final-ness of the franchise: Square called it that because every game they made failed and they made a fantasy game as their final title before they'd go out of business. It was a success.
11,01First
yeah look at the re series of movies those are bad
Is that like moderators or something?
Matt: admins
00,02Matt, bronystate staff get colours :P
CUPCAKES DERP
Matt I want to know too
second
Freefall29: Earth Defence Force: Insect Armageden
hi Phase4
I couldve solved world hunger during ALL that time
Nittany_Discord: Spirits Within ISN'T Advent Children.
Ahhh
advent children is cool
/me 11,01runs
Deceptive_Cadence: what butthurt? it has as much to do with Final Fantasy as my left ass cheek also it's overly long AND boring to boot. It's just pretty...
1,11Matt: Only mods use them to stand out from the rest of the chat.
spirits within wasn't *thaat* bad...
I actully tried this one game called drawn to life on the DS
Well I'm out, goodnight folks.
OMFG just reroll if your goning to
Okay then.
HERE WE GO
mfw Val trolled everyone (including his fellow mods) and picked a shit movie that they thought was good. Spirits Within is a *terrible* movie, you're thinking of Advent Children. I don't even think Spirits Within actually had anything to do with any Final Fantasy game, if I remember right.
ogod
wat.... final fantasy 7 was skipped why should it be B
wtf
SolairePony89: or any EDF game
if only people would make clear and obvious choices for their god damn votes
00,02ohai Bronysith

Yes, it's all in black and white.
Shizuka: is there a Rifftrax for Spirits Within?
inkBot: No, Clerks.
Maybe we'll get lucky and they won't be able to find a copy of the FF movie
Graywhoof, It's been raining at my place too.
Silverscreen: Discord directed it
00,10cause black and whit is edgy
Silverscreen: its the opening give it a min...
11,02But I love Final Fantasy 13 ;~;
:P
PaladinDrakkenwolf: All the time. :$
Black and White movie so it must be awful
Silverscreen Budget problems, that is why it is black and white
K_A lol

oni_link: I know.
SuperBrony64: Which is exactly why I'm disappointed.
Anyone remember the Cleks. animated series?

IT'S IN BLAKC AND WHITE BECAUSE YOU TOUCH YOURSELF AT NIGHT
DocSane yeah
umm
brohoof SuperBrony64
SuperBrony64: it was a LONG GODDAMN HALLWAY WITH AUTOMATED FIGHTS
kitty :)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT who is this Alan Turing guy
Kandarihu: its not... that bad, its a sequal but it is indeed its own story (kinda)
Oh it cannot be that hard...
Black and White cheaper maybe
what do you see in FF13 @superbrony64?
No, it's in grayscale. (Or a really light sepia? I'm kinda colorblind sometimes.)
but this wasn't the B movie supposed to be something else?
Oh... okay.
yeah, i want to know too
Who is driving car? Bear is driving car! How can that be?!!!
Couldn't even afford color.
Shit.
its a black commedy
Jeez that is harsh.
05inkBot: read on the forntpage
Oh yeah! I forgot about the gross thing this movie covers! Oh man. Chat is going to go ape shit.
Phelous?
11,02It has great graphics and awesome music ^-^
Freefall29: You don't need the @, btw
SuperBrony64: you like ff13?
05its stated that it w was replaced
/me can't wait
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In Snowball Effect: The Story of 'Clerks' on the special edition DVD, Kevin Smith says that the film's original title was "Inconvenience". Then it was changed to "Rude Clerks" before being shortened to Clerks..
00,10yes inkBot, but people like to pick imposabl to find movies
Couldn't find the 1st B movie again
11,02Bronysith: Yeah
Looks like a very unsaturated sepia.
/me strangles SuperBrony64
well, I'm gonna bleach my hair while I'm watching this
11,01If you promise not to clop anymore, we'll show the color version.
huh
K_A: i think its greyscale too
/me stabs superbrony64
SuperBrony64: ...neither of which make a good game
ait
thats for only playing for graphics
SilIsh_Bob read the wiki
Lol Rude clerk.
I promise not to clop
What is tonight's second pony ep?
SuperBrony64: BAD GAMER! BAD!
Anyone wanna bet that Final Fantasy Movie is going to get replaced?
Nittany_Discord: No deal!
i like this movie. so not complaining
/me slaps SuperBrony64 with a cinderblock.
04To show the color version we'd have to show Clerks 2
Even though I dont anyways
:p
1,11Nittany_Discord: NEVER!
7.9 on IMDb
just drank a whole bottle of cider LIKE A BOSS!
lol
ok
Midnight_Fyre: Putting your hoof down.
Oh, God. This life... This was my life for so so long.
SuperBrony64: i dont think the graphics and music sell the game. THE GAME sells the game
1994
Final Fantasy?!
Wrek: The torrents and newsgroups failed us?
quick. burn the witch!
I Promise
TheGreatAndPowerfulT can't, watching Clerks
Nittany_Discord I could never promise that
00,10Dont make me shoot you all at the end.
JK Im a boy
Nittany_Discord unless i go blind
Shoot me, bro :p
04I love this movie because I'm hipster as fuck
just sayin
umm
Coome at me Bro!
RosePetal: That got a 6.4 on IMDb
/me pats SuperBrony64 on the head "It's okay man, but graphics/sound aren't the only things that matter!"
Everlasting_Joy: thanks
Nopony fucks with Dende!
is this the show?
Oh.
04Alternatively I just like the movie because it's just one big episode of Seinfeld
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film's shoestring budget is part of the reason it was shot in black and white. A number of different types of lighting were used, and this would have required a lot of post production to resolve issues related to the varying color temperatures. With black and white, this isn't a problem.
Putting Your Hoof down was the ep I chose, so I'll count it as a win :D
RosePetal: not looking forward to that
the best part of Spirits within was the Thriller music video
video games... hmmmm. what exactly where those things about again.... hmmmm
Wow.
uh...
Ghosties: not sure if serious or poking fun at hipsters >.>
04Or I like the movie because it's practically me and my best friend working a job together
I chose Friendship is Magic part 2.
Silverscreen: another reason I love this movie
11,02Final Fantasy 13 > Final Fantasy 7
wait this whole thing is in black and white?
DeadpoolDash: What??
SilIsh_Bob a computer scientist
Wow... Cheap...

I saw this movie before it was shown on Bronystate. *puts on hipster glasses*
Ok SB I hate FF in general but even I recognise that's trolling.
thats just trolling

Dark92Enigma-deux: THE HELL MAN JUST KICK YOUR OLD NICK YOU IDGIT

SuperBrony64: sorry i had a stroke
FF13 is like the Avatar of Gaming. It's pretty, it looks nice. Everything else is debatable. No need to hate on people who like it... Though I would like to slap Cameron
SaxyPretender: lol

LordAuz you're 12.. don't worry about it
Silverscreen: ik, he had so many money problems during the filming
11,01He made a good investment.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Filmed at the same store in which director Kevin Smith was working at the time. As he was only allowed to film outside of business hours, and because bright enough lights couldn't be afforded, the plot included an explanation for the shutters being always down.
HHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
LordAuz: really?
Why is there so much RP IN THE REGULARS ROOM?

I LOVE RETURN OF THE JEDI
yum
IM EATING PRINGLES TOO
otakon: okay
Shizuka: I think they decided that, because of how big a bomb it was financially, and how hated it was by critics and fans alike, that it qualified for B in spite of the budget.
empire is better though
Was Kaitlin his girlfriend?
superretroworld:, the only way you'd cut his arm is if you were blind.
Empire too

I just finished a tube of Pickle flavored Pringles

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Despite having almost no violence in the film (with the exception of the fight between Dante and Randal), it was originally given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA based solely on its graphic dialogue. The film's distributor Miramax hired attorney Alan M. Dershowitz (of the O.J. Simpson defense team) who successfully petitioned the MPAA to lower its rating to R without
Yeah!

That is scary
Nudie Booth.

You know what the weird part about this movie is? In real life, way weirder stuff than Clerks happens.

Personally I think Spirits within was a good movie if you ignore the final fantasy part
Vordox: DA RULEZ!
Bronysith: I've gotten so into Dark Souls it's crazy. Waaaay more then Skyrim
RURURURURURURURUS!
05Vordox: no not really
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The anti-smoking sentiment in the film represented Kevin Smith's own viewpoint when he wrote the screenplay. Silent Bob doesn't inhale when he puffs on his cigarette because of this. After filming this movie, he became a two-pack-a-day smoker.
Vordox: still a good movie o_O
that customer is 60% of our government
Help! I'm being offended!
Sumica it's sad because how smart he is, but how...demotivated by it
Well, I don't know.

Otakon: RURU DESU
SolairePony89: its more in depth than skyrim
You
butthurt man is butthurt
/me is wondering what the poin of this movie is
Bronysith: No, this movie is making me want to leave, but I've been in so many situations like this, to see a little careless vengence is something sweet.

le milk maids
Silverscreen: Not sure what to think about that.

She's a class-girlfriend
in a row?
lasange
bummer
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Clerks. is loosely based on "The Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri hence the name. Also, there are nine breaks in the movie to represent the nine rings of hell.
thats logical?
1,11^ no shit.
Cooks Lasagnua for lunch for you? That's awwesome
ewwwwwww
Mind blown.

Silverscreen: Its a great series :3
Silverscreen: it was awesome
04Smith never got the chance to film the scene with the funeral, so he did it later on and included it in the DVD release
Which is why this totally was a series.
I would like pie
RosePetal that would be awesome
00,03MrPoniator_Laptop: It was a scene they couldn't film in live action
They probably used the animation so they could only have one set to film on.
/me gives otakon pie
chocolate cream pie would be nice
kk
what is this movie called again?
I always miss the lottery...
Freefall29: clerks
Clerks

Randal is a terrible, terrible person.
Randall is MY hero
no closure

Paradigm

just cliffhanger
you have to replay it though
Bronysith: :O IMPOSSIBRU!
04Randal is the best troll ever
Dat milk jug
Bronysith: it was the MIDDLE GODDAMN GAME THAT IS WHY!
Grunt! :[
SolairePony89: at least me3 had closure
Why is this movie greyscale anyway?
giggity
Bronysith: At least it wasn't complete shit AND no closure
middle games NEVER have closure
Paradigm, the want it need it spell.
HEY YOU ANT ANY BUFFER
what? It's like 5 pounds
1,11Yeah, I can't be friends with people like that. I'd end up knocking his ass out.
I. Am. KROGAN!!!!!
It was shot on the cheap.
Randall is a smart guy who should be working somewhere higher up...but doesnt have the motive or desire to actually do anything with his life. He represents what Dante could become
guess what
why does everyone ask if they are open?
RaveBrony: I know >.>
Bronysith: Did you play the bloody game?! There was NO closure!
however, ME3 had no closure for the FINAL GODDAMN GAME IN THE SERIES
trolololo
:D
04Friends with who, Silver?
Oh, hey, Mr_Poniator
Ghosties: some say the scene in clerks 2 where randall battles a guy in a wheelchair on his blogn is what started trolling
Stop judging my weight.
70 lbs :D
If you grunt, then you must be a runt! :[
Feel that ;)

Ghosties i remember "remotes

Silent Bob=The perfect costumer
otakon: I find it really hard to believe that someone could warrent a fine with no proof other than the victim's word
!pokemon
Ponies47: I believe half :P
WHY GODDAMMIT WHY!?
but it would fucking support EA
I'm pretty glad they're gone, though I can stand using them easy.
Ghosties i remember "remotes" that had cables to the top load VHS players =p

04Drastic is better

Is the animates series as good as this movie?

Fortunately, Kevin Smith was convinced that was just too much.
10/derp
- /)\
i liked it :P
Nyst: ya
Bye guys
9/10 Would bang.
and then it ends
I'd give my verdict for this movie in a form of a picture
LAAAAAAAME
DocSane: yeah i know, but thank god he didnt, then there wouldnt be a sequel
DocSane: Interestingly dark
Animated series is odd.
1,11...
04YES, the animated series is AWESOME
So lame!
funny movie, first time
^
PEENARZ 8------>
Colts with bolts.

Who's Driving? BEAR IS DRIVING/10
Here it comes!
How old was that movie?
How can that be?!
Ghosties: Stream the animated series!! :$
Ghosties: It was good, people just need to be willing to stop looking at the norm in movies
1,11Damn, I get distracted by my roomate and miss the fucking end.
From 1995 no?
What... why? Why would you need to kill Dante?
SolairePony89: god, I hate those bastards with a PASSION
My favorite episode!
Matt: 1994
We need some ponified clerks
night guys
yes its over
Bye alexxm!
sweet next is a fluttershy episode :)
/me eats tasty goat cheese and matzos.
1,11yes, it's from 1995.
04I really liked the end
Hello Everypony !
Silverscreen: There's the euro stream
Randomnerd: which episode again?
Btw, how to stream?
1,11How'd it end? I missed it.
hello
SolairePony89: it was a dark twist, probably to add that "Randomness of life" deal to it
Silverscreen: actually its 1994
hey Alister[M]
Movie's over? OK, I'm back.
There were like three extra endings.
00,10Silverscreen, it just ends
11,01Just talking.
Silverscreen: It just, ended :D
YEAH FLUTTERSHY FTW. THE STARE OF JUSTICE!
wb!
fluttershy didn't get enough of her own episodes.
really derp
The ending explained all the mysteries. Dante is Randal's long lost cousin
it ended no country for old men-style: no ending at all.
Ponys and then bed it is for me almost 5am here ^-^
1,11ah.
i love this solo
94-95? That would explain all those backflipped caps
Hey, Alister[M]
otakon: Movie had enough of that. Killing Dante is just uneccesary
I just wasn't getting into that movie so I left about 20 or 30 minutes in

pwny: :D
Matt: maybe that's the idea... Shy doesn't like being the center of attention = less episodes
EVRYONE DES THIS STUFF
i dont like seeing fluttershy suffer
It is 4 am here in Europe.
Randall was Dante's imagination
04After Randal basically slaps some sense into Dante about being an ass, they close shop and end as friends
YAY! I JUST CAME IN FOR MY FAVORITE PONY EPISODE!
SolairePony89: yeah, honestly it's just a huge suckerpunch
or taken advantage of
in 5 years
/me Whatcha'r gonna do, when IRONMANIA, and it's 24-inch-pythons RUN WILD ON YOU!!!!!!!!?????????????
DocSane: and suddenly bear
Ghosties: good way to end up
lol "Go watch Dogma!"
Randomnerd: Wait, so I'm not the only one here who's favorite episode is this one?

Less episodes = less character devlopment

13dumb question, anyone aplyed cp_foundry before?

Yes, she needs 'em assburgers
Shizuka: we couldnt even watch the next episode for like an hour because he was crying after episode 8

You're too adorable, that's the problem

Wrek: wat?

04But I like Clerks, AlienWarhead
Where has TheRainbowDash been?
AFTER The ep
05only true pairing
Rarity's quite the social engineer.
How was that being assertive?
is her accent british?
she did pay for it
I like to think that all of the ponies have the potential to become discorded on their own, Discord just brought their bad sides out
Rarity is best seductress
Also, love the way Rarity sadi Darling

Technically, Fluttershy is wrong...

04If Randy Savage did the voice of Iron Will
could always just fly over him
Kick his Cock
Being assertive = being a dick
EAT HIS FACE
I remember talking to a non-brony hater about this episode and it's referance to Mr. T
Midnight_Fyre: like I said. REAL LIFE SCALE TWILIGHT THAT IS ANATOMICALLY CORRECT.
Iron Will's Goats are so lame.
When someone stands in front of me in real like, I step gingerly around them. XDDDDD.... TT___TT
Iron Will's catchphrases are pretty cool, really.
Would MLP be able to afford Randt Savage?
1,11Dark92Enigma-deux: I think he would if he could.
BITS
fluttercry: Nah, to be a ninja, you have to do it with chopsticks.
AAAAAAAAAAW SHIT

04Iron Will would be my absolute favorite character in the FiM show FOR ALL THE TIMES
Oh fluttershy...

Macho Man Randy Savage. what a guy

SolairePony89: nope, heard it came from 4chan
Unrealism?
Ghosties The moment he voiced that wrestling villain for Dial M for Monkey, it was the most epic moment of my life
evil squee
05that wasnt that bad

Flutterrage activate!
SO LET'S STOP TALKING ABOUT PLUSHIES AND WATCH THE PONY EPISODE HOW ABOUT THAT? THAT SOUNDS AWFUL GOOD RIGHT NOW

Oh yeah, I have heard that name. forgot
05like
bon bon
BON BON!!
GRR
dammit bonbon, move
1,11He's not doing anything BAD, he just unwittingly encouraged a negative concept that built worse.
Reikim: eeyup
Bon Bon sounds like RD
Hello bon bon
One of Bon Bon's many voices.
/me puts Lyra on the moon
Couldn't she just fly over?
could fluttershy fly over?
Bon Bon, different day, different voice.
fly perhaps?
fly over them
dammmit bon bon
The blonde bitches of ponyville.
Is this a racist joke?
NOPE
Why not fly over?!
Silverscreen: I am confused
LAUGH AT THAT :3
THAT'S DEE DEE PICKLES
And... different girlfriend?
Giraffe Ponies
listen to that VA
to the moon!
FLUTTERSHY, Y U NO FLY OVER?
dang it, I wanted to hear that joke
By the way, remember: Don't screw with Fluttershy. EVER.
The bitches of ponyville.
Ghosties he was called the RASSLOR
but... fluttershy can hardly fly
The mare of many voices
I hate people like these
Rung Ring!!
she has wings...
05,15Mewel
bon bon the garbagemare

Fluttershy does not appreciate your racist jokes :[
And I'm back.
Fly over
AAAAW SHIT
DOUBLE KILL.
again fluttershy, you have wings...
aww I wanted to hear the Joke :(
bc she shouldn't HAVE to bc flying is tiring?
Back to see Fluttershy godmode everything.
AW HELLL NAWWWWWWWWWWWWW
*Ring Ring.
STRENGHT
dee dee pickles voice, totally
omnipony: MLP writers arent that good
Lyra has had one voice and it is better than any of Bonbon's half dozen voices
tip: self confiendence comes from rhyming
Or that.
FLY, fluttershy, you're a Pegasus
BUCKED
@ paladinno mohawk, wrong horns and no cow tail, but good anyway
dat racest to donkys
Poor Bon Bon
Kicking ass is more fun than flying
so apparently the ponyville ponys all sound like they're from jersey
sounds like Harly Quinn
Tyrant Fluttershy
why didn't she...fly over them
lol true
Then she has to walk through garbage
NOPW NUB

Being assertive = being a dick= being lazy?
Hear that? She's stoked.

O_o
Nittany_Discord: I think that Caramel recolor is named Cherry Cola.

I like non-assertive Fluttershy more than assertive Fluttershy. Assertive Fluttershy just seems to take away the Fluttershy I love.

and TAXI BRAWL
We should, however, keep in mind that Fluttershy is not Iron Will's only student. Any of these background ponies that Fluttershy picked a fight with might also have attended his seminars.

Why does Pinkie look confused when Iron Will breaks the fourth wall.
I'm sad we didn't get a Fluttershy walking down the street trying to hitch a ride scene
"Creep"? You're just jealous of his pecs.

Great movie night everypony!
Really enjoyed it!
GIANT ROBOTS
dat B movie was awesome
AFTER PARTY
well that was fun
Kandirhu: but it has the obviously easily abusable opening of customers simply saying they're not satisfied to get out of paying
Silverscreen: maybe not... Fluttershy was extremely shy when first meeting Twi, remember
Great movie night.
like last month!
ONE MOAR :(
oh
bedtime for me now. Birds are already singing here. See your around everypony
since you know, he's Shy's personal pet and all

Silverscreen: My impression is that before Twilight came, Fluttershy was so withdrawn she wouldn't have been friends with Rarity or Pinkie Pie (Pinkie's opinion of the relationship notwithstanding)
:|

SEA PONIES SONG>THIS DAY ARIA
his may be cliche and predictable, but maybe they could it start with the Mane 6 and the Apple family going down to the ocean for some fun. When they get there, they meet some old pony captain warning them not to go out to sea telling them that Sea Ponies have been wrecking ships, stealing stuff, and dragging ponies down to the depths of the sea as of late. They don't believe him since Sea Ponies are supposed to be just a myth, and they just think tha
Thanks everypony for making this an awesome Movie Night!

Also, pretty sure we'd get Hippocampus for S3 of FiM
but yeah, thanks for the stream Sumica
Baii pony_2671!
thanks Sumica
G1 was dark
I would do the sea ponies as awful eldrich horros which must be stopped.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=related
Where did someone get this VCL pony from?
NO, THIS IS PATRICK!...YA DONT SAY!?!?!?
Sumica: thanks again man, greatly appreciated
00,10Glad you all enjoyed it. It meens alot to hear you say it.
PEACE TO THE PONYS :D:);):P:$<3
i dont like this day aria because for one. it wasnt sung by any of the mane cast
I SAID HEY
G'night, guys! :)
Mermaids are monsters, after all.
Sumica: Anytime ^^
s3 wishes: -seaponies -lyrabon canon -original derpy back -Gilda redemption episode
true
That babies are trying to sleep! Tha's too bad.
And i think the Cone Pony either means there's a problem or nothing's streaming XD
that had got to be the funniest B Movie to date
and
but it was still a good song
ALWAS LOVE AND TOLORATRE
Sumica: Can I gives u lots of wubs?
Prime example: http://equestriamlp.livejournal.com/350386.html
trust me
dammit, brb
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Otaq2tmNMM
I BAKED YOU A PIE YAY WHAT FLAVOR PINKIE PIE FLAVOR *pinkie jumps out of pie in slow mo*
id rather listen to this day aria than see blood in my urine
Seriously, who would tolerate Gilda if she had a damn good explanation?
They start out looking all cute, and then Twilight would realize that they all look like clones of ponies they already know.
PEACE
Hell fire!
when i die i wanna go to Equestria
Like the Mane 6 go out to sea, but then they're attacked by a group of Sea Ponies who either kidnap Applebloom or steal something of great importance, so in order to get it back the Mane 6 go to Zecora who turns them into Sea Ponies themselves
not even safe mode?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpvq6VVEzto
00,10Just so long as you share the wubs with every one that streams and our hard working tecies too.
.
Somebronyyays: Heavan is what ever you want it to be
Bronysith: That's... a pretty low bar.
Gilda got a raw deal.
I GIVE WUBS TO ALL MODS!!!
jfviksdfjbikfd
don't forget the wubs for the admin ponies
Night! :)
I'm appreciative
i give wubs to all colored text
Phase4: You get ze wub to
Randomnerd: i just dont really care for it
Baii GilDash!
Oh yeah, video links are aloud!
We always feel grateful to all you streamers out there.
Lots of things are better than blood in your urine.
TOY_PON3: O U
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_U2z5naWAw
id rather see blood in my urine than the star wars prequels
MahBoi777: What I'm siri
Aloowed, even!
:(
The way I see it: Gilda wants to hang out with Dash. Pinkie is clingie as fuck. Gilda has some jealousy issues, which Pinkie exacerbates. Because the Mane 6 have the plot/writers on their side, Gilda is automagically the bad guy.
... okay I agree with you there.
