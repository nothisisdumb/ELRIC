lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRmCtfiz9FE

CobraX83 you can also try and use ios 36 instead of 249 to install the base you neeed
(37)
Inorite

but you have to be obcenely rich
All the more reason I should be a manager of Walmart
She is
screw the rule i have money
:P
CobraX83
ya
k
Although that wouldn't exactly make me rich I don't think
Oh yeah, I forgot everyone where I live is a millionaire
Hmm
Mhm
and lack of a public school
Yeah right
maybe can screw the rules cause she has money
hehehe
nice job sexual it looks like that may have worked
but some people we went to school with beleived that everybody from her town is rich
they were from my area
There is a section of my city specifically for obscenely rich people though
*stupid
You have to be invited to even get in there
there is here too
well, not that much
no invites here
just that you have to be rich to be able to afford to live in the rich part of town here
yup its going fine now
/me has seen this part of town, from the outside of course
then they shot me for looking at it too long
Why would you even want to live in a closed off area like that?
Seems stupid to me
I agree
but of course they'll just say I'm "just jealous" or something :P
/me pops in
keep the Hamburglars away from their rich-person-McDonalds or something

its old
xD
LU379 or some shiz
verbatim > *
do it oldschool at 2x
:D
i did 4x
still its like
is this shit supposed to auto load if it does work?
or do i gotta goto hmc
lbiza, what's the problem?
and like load from gx
atleast not FAT32 and i have like a gizzilion hd shiz on most of em
!insult ChanServ
word
!do insult
wii can read ntfs as well
oh it can?
yup, but no scrubbing unless you store them as wbfs files, and you can't write to the disk
yes
fat32 > * when it comes to wii
fat32 is good
whats wrong with good ol NTFS?
i use wbfs though, because i don't use much homebrew, and the homebrew i use is lauched from the sd card permanently installed into the wii
/me is talking to an old friend on MSN
that SD card is mine lol
no
not unless you set up forwarder channels
10-4
with fat32 you don't need an sd
with CFG?
who's that?
find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
then click ok. twice.
no, I'm just curious :(

xdpirate, bullshit...I don't even use an sd in my wii
but i had to use "36" not "236"
^Wulfgar^, D:
cuz i didnt have "236"
:P
I thought the cfg forwarder... *forwarded* to the SD card
Yeah
and pardon mine as well
I just told him I left SF because SR got mad at me for something completely retarded
lol
His response: "rofl"
truth
i modded my 360 yrs ago but it just got the RROD
ha
yeah
and supposedly u can use whats called "X-clamp" to fix it
but even then its kinda 50/50
cfg forwarders arent any different from gx forwarders
its like $25
for all the shit including the "artic thermal paste"
with only 6% having problems with the wii
gmail ftw
same goes for Gmail
:D
/me has MSN and Gmail
to see if i wanna mod mine
lol
:(
just to make sure? or how do i know its modded?
install cfgloader, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager

/me turns Lambda's frown upside down
lbiza, you can find the release thread for CFGLoader here: http://tinyurl.com/wii-cfgloader
:)
:(
didn't stay
:)
jk
:D
the guide says now all you have to do is plug the hard drive into the wii and boot uloader.
find rockband 2 and click "configure". next click "saves & Dlc"
then click ok. twice.
on the wii
and load the wbfs with it

/me doesn't get it
I lol'd at his view of racism I mean
pretty much the opposite of the modern one
downgrading is pretty much unnecessary
damooo
yes
?

and follow the guide
downgrade
It does
Boo fanservice
?downgrade
with the ?
I agree
? downgrade
cheers
downgrade
?downgrade
lol
why would people downgrade? does 4.3 cause issues?
That means you Cynder, Miranda, and every single character of Twilight!
yes
problems
best to downgrade
animals cant softmod with 4.3
and it has quto-update
i was reading something on a softmod for 4.3u....something about installing a korean ios
it wont ask u to update
looool
quote incomplete
Animals, the koreon ios is apart of the downgrade prosses
It showed the whole thing for me
Where did it cut off?
? downgrade
yea, the thing i was reading was about using the korean ios to install cios and shit
for 4.3
downgrade ?
O.o
I just pressed "XD" and got a debug screen
...wtf?
fuck 4.3
How do you "press XD"?
Ctrl + "D"
there is no reosn to be even on 4.2
for that matter
i dont see the difference between 4.1 and 4.2, but i dunno
4.0 here.
Yeah, there's no reason to downgrade from 4.2 if you're already there. But no reason to upgrade to 4.2.
thats how i feel
but anyway
you know you got goosebumps at that part
if i mod a wii that has 4.1, i just leave it at 4.1
I know I did

how long has wiibrew been down for?

really?
http://filetrip.net/f9332-SuperDump-1-3.html
anyway, I just updated my wii shop channel through wiiscu but wii shop still says it's not up to date and asks for a system update
and I'm trying to figure out why
this works with dvd movies?
with like
no
video_ts and audio_ts?
he wanted to rip a dvd to a wii
not a dump
witch is ironiclky stupid
yes
witch is ironiclky stupid
wii suxs on dvd vid
haha
tee hee
2eh?
seems not needed is why he left
only system i know that can play dvd iso's console wize is xbox with XBMC
ok
yepyep
seriously, though, why would a single website be down for only me?
could this be a high-level routing problem?
no problem
the IP I get for wiibrew.org is 195.178.184.67
um
that is correct
burn it to a DL dvd
and be sure to use the correct layerbreak
well...i did...and my nephew said it didn't work. but i didn't set the layer break. didn't know i needed to for the wii then.
well I can ping it, I get no replies
this is it
http://www.411mania.com/game_article_pictures/13150.jpg
i'd still rather scrub it, if that works, rather than wasting another DL on it.
Hi children
/me sleeps now
2084960
/me sleeps now
fierygt, 2084960
and that seems to work
damn, though, this is irritating
burn to a DL
damn. alright. i suppose i'll use a dl. thanks.
why burn?
realy?
and that IP is an empty server for me
still resolves to the same ip
maybe the old address is cached locally though
do you have a cable router
it might be awhile
just got back from watching dispicable me
be a good unkel and buy his a drive
/me declines, is currently having his mouth occupied
sheesh. i find him all the games for his wii and DS as it is!
well
hoe old is he?
about 9
(for DNS)
ok
read pm
was it any good?
mmm
I did
restarted ncsd after setting resolv.conf to 8.8.8.8
still getting the same ip
And apparently I don't get nick alerts from /me
interesting
195.178.184.67 is?
yes
I get nothing pinging that from my own machine and a machine is alive message pinging it from another machine I have shell on in another city

wiihack
hmm
lots of folk in here
anyone know anything about loadstructor or crap?
there was a kid with an Erector set in the Sandlot
that is a bold faced lie
essecks, no we dont
i'm never gonna get it working =o\
essecks, don't bother with it
i use cover flow
wow
thats old school
i just wanted to add a couple specific titles i used frequently
like netflix
get cfgloader
essecks, gimme a sec..i'll check it out
<3
whats cfgloader?
essecks, http://www.sendspace.com/file/3rf94s
well than tiger 011 wont work with it
cfgloader looks like coverflow and you can install netflix to the hard drive
even tho its shitty media
memorex
also known as cLoader?
wii reads them jsut fine
no
cloader wtf is that?
dunno
wii reads memorex just fine?
yes
i think it means Uloader
this shit should work! we fucked up somewhere down the line
too bad eh
we have a old wii to boot
essecks, no
my 3.1 wii plays backups from dvds
essecks, its the best usbloader out there
http://clusterrr.com/dump/loadstructor.png that looks pretty self explanitory
does it have a homepage?
i'll just ltfg
like smg1
shit
/me l‰hett‰‰ 161 musta leidi muuvieta to |Shadow|
OH YEAH, i tried migrating to this way back in the day
i used nero
should i use imgburn latest?
yes
there is were u fucked up
why cfgloader > cover flow?
nero is shit for wii
4x or 2x?
essecks, because its best
imgburn is good for burning everything, movies, wii games, xbox 360 games
http://www.imgburn.com/
ok i knew that for x360
i burn at 4x for the wii, i dont know if that matters but plays perfectly
i have an older version of img burn
but ill get latest
http://www.imgburn.com/
maybe
k
imgburn is awesome
if you look at the disc that imgburn did and the nero disc you can see the difference
nero = bloatware
2x or 4x
16x
cfg loader : http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638
anyone tried/used tri-force
16x i thought slower
nah
i burnt all mine at 16x
never had a problem
if you have a pioneer burner i dont think it matters

Welcome back IOS61 ;)
yes
!rules
lukegb: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
to both?
bor: an sd card makes it easier but is not needed per se, but I'd highly recommend getting one since none of the guides tell you how to boot without one
ie. you can setup homebrew channel and others to use a harddisk but you can only install homebrew channel from SD
they are just as easy to brick as any other wii, if you use an US update on a korean wii, that's a brick. If you use EU update on a US wii, that's a brick
mkay
i have US firmware on it i think
or english firmware
there is an English hack, but it's still korean firmware inside
ntfs is read-only and wbfs is isos-only
but that has filesize limitations
isos on the disk are stored in .wbfs files which are split in chunks of 1-2GB
but of course you're right, some people recommend ntfs to get around the 2GB limitation, but no wii app can write to ntfs
depends on the version, most people here recommend using cfgloader instead of GX
k
but other than that, any risks?
firmware 4.3 doesn't allow you to disable auto updating anymore, but if that wii has 4.3 you'll run into many other problems anyway, I doubt anyone with a sane mind would install 4.3 on a softmodded wii
i think i have 4.1
it said 4.1u in the wii settings menu anyway
oh?
it came from a shop in bangkok, he didnt speak much english ;)
wbfs manager is for wbfilesystem formatted drives, wii backup manager is for fat/ntfs
cool thanks
both gx and cfgloader can dump actual disks to the drive too if it's writable (not ntfs)
? list
? list
no factoid for wii backup manager
? hddcompatibility
^Wulfgar^ usually posts a link to it as long as he's not asleep ;)
he wrote it?
no he's just usually very active in here, just now it's the middle of the night for him I think
right right
!rules
Ziggy^^: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
Ziggy^^: hi
Hmm? Haven't heard of that before.
its strange
is there something i can use that helps diagnose ios issues/>
syscheck?
!wb sysCheck
sysCheck: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SysCheck
sysCheck does several checks on installed IOS and cIOS:
Then again, if you've installed cioscorp/similar... It's likely you'd have problems.
i guess i was thinking syscheck scanned drive for sectors but i guess that is bootmii
i never installed cioscorp
ive read a lot of bad things
it was running fine until i put this program on there that i found online that is suppose to help keep ios's up to date
it really screwed things up
since then it hasnt been very stable
does anyone recommend running one version over another (would that help in stability)?
i was running 4.2 but then went to 4.1 to see if it would help

04Hi
04meow
hey RN, hows things?
04I'm ok thanks - got a fornight's temporary work in a law firm.
04how are you all?
03hm
03I'm watching this documentary about healthcare
03does the free NHS in the UK work?
04Ask someone like Xai because he's the expert in politics LOL
03LOL
lol
04well it's good if you have little or no money I guess
03Xai would just call me a stupid American -_-
03because I'm slightly Republican
03and apparently that doesn't fly with him
03hm
03you've never hadto go to the hospitcal?
03-c
04Yeah
03yeah
03did it work?
04well I had to wait 8 hours to be seen
03LOL
04I was cured, that's the main thing
04well approx 8 hours
03yeah
only time i've been in an nhs hospital is when i broke my wrist, i was in and out in a couple of hours
03well the American system is weirld
03I broke my wrist and had to wait about 5 hours to be seen
04I've been bitten by dogs three times and those were the only other times
03they'll ese you right away
04Well I couldn't eat or drink and they still made me wait
04hehe
03XD
03yeah, it's probably crap
04not that I condone that sort of thing
hi Rocket_Ninetales!
haha
04DRF let's just say the NHS is a necessary evil, otherwise there would be like a thousand people left
03they just die :/
03well
03most jobs here have free health insurance
04Ah, I didn't know that.
03I mean, not like minimum wage jobs or something
03my family's insurancde is free
03through my dad's job
03yeah
03well I agree that it doesn't work perfectlly
03-l
03he's like a hardcore Democrat
03Medicre.
:D
03*Medicare
03*that's* free
03if you're over 60
04Oh that's good then.
03however they don't pay for EVERYTHING
/me fumigates for aristeos
04Here you get free prescriptions if you're on benefits, over 60 I think or over 65 or under 18
04something like that
04or if you lie on the form - again just an idea, and I don't condone it xD
03well I dunno much about Medicare
03but people like my grandparents have it
03Medicaid is for poor people but it sucks
03and they don't pay the doctors enough either
04The NHS is ok to fulfull its purpose.
04But some directors get like £100,000 a year
04of the NHS I mean
04so it's like....so you can't pay for breast cancer drugs but you can afford to pay them that money
04Glad to see they have their priorities right xD
04We even have a free vet service here for people on welfare.
03marching bands FTW
04Yeah but not when you've just been up until 3am xD
04and all the neighbours are talking outside...and you can hear the band coming down from a mile away.

wha-
the cios installer for usb2/dvd support requires IOS36 to be vulernable
most likely it isn't
WHEE
if it isn't, there's an option right in dop-mii that says "give me a vulnerable IOS 36"
do that

02Summer school
see, I am driving MYSELF :)
oh
13neat
03TimeShift, I did that this mroning
03*mornin
03I used my phone as a modem
03and used my laptop from the freeway going at 70mph
03now I'm just using the hotel's Wi-Fi, though.
03er I already spammed it
Greetings.
thats not a good idea. it would be sad if tst lost you... while you were on it
/me runs
I could use tethering, too, yet I don't like to because it
03well I cheat
03They usually charge $60 to tether
03I just don't pay it
is quite imperformant and sucks the battery of my phone empty waay too fast
03I use an app called EasyTether
03...
03It charges it...
03at least mine
03as for speeds, it's like 1mbps which isn't bad for a phone
why should I carry around cables if I'm mobile?
03you only need one cable...
03I put my laptop in a carrying case
03I just shove it in there
this puts the point "being mobile" quite ad absurdum
03eh
03w/e
03so you also don't bring a charger?
03sounds like a brilliant idea
mobile_no_wires
03I just have a carrying case
why bring a charging wire if the battery of the netbook lasts 10 hours and I'm just abour 4-5 hours away of a power plug?
03that's perfectly moble
03my battery lasts like 2 at most >_>
03then again this is a powerhouise
03I*house
/me doesn't understand Xeli's post
03LOL
03we're talking laptops
Murrrnapples :3
03as I can use this as a portable desktop
03so it serves two purpose
03s
yeh this happened to me last time i did it, didn't have bootmii as an option
03unlike netbooks
do laptops work faster etc. when they are plugged in?
03no
03well depends
03sometimes, if the company makes it not run as fast on battery
to conserve battery power right?
03for example I was watching a Blu-Ray disc on the way up here
03your laptop probably couldn't even play Blu-rays
03and FlameLugia, yes
03well I have an actual Blu-Ray drive
Hey, it's me afterall.
drf
03what
06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
6EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IPODS
03eXAKR whya/
03*?
02I guess...I replied O.0
03TimeShift, but that's my point
I have my fullsize-notebook running 3.5 hours on battery and my standalone-computer for anything else
03This way I only need *one* laptop
03It's portable enough that I can take it anywhere
I'm thinking of making my own scripts based on those
and I like specialized tools for the mission I need to go
/me RUNS
03LOL no thanks then
03I prefer just one computer that does it all
lol k
.-.
/me tickles Espeon
re:re
/me also squirms
04lol
03first of all
03what do you mean way too much weight
03this is like 5 pounds
03that's fine
I lol'd
03and sure, I just leave htis plugges in
03*plugged
03so I fail to see a problem
well, my netbook is around ONE pound :)
13OO
13EPIC FAIL
12netbooks are gross
13for drf
13How could you fail to see a problem
with battery of course. without battery it's half a pound
12size isn't everything
12weight same thing
12at least drf is getting a work out
is smarter?
12yeah 5 pounds is childs play
12i can lift that much with my tiny finger
03that's with battery too
03so yeah
12he's not carrying it arund
12around
12its on his lap
03precisely
03also TimeShift, I have a CARRYING CASE
03I've said this enough
03I carry it by a strap on my shoulder.
as I said: mobility fail
03how is that fail
03it goes with me
03that's fine
03also I have a smartphone if I need som+ething that fits in my pocket
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzmh6JfXTtw&NR=1
THAT is mobility. Being able to work ANYWHERE you feel

13I wish I had that
TimeShift
03yes it's a portable computer
03what's wrong with that
:/
03I use it in the back seat of the van all the time
04well
04he's like the last person i'd see as a good mod
04he's hardly active and he has a temper tantrum whenever things don't go his way
13you probably hacked
13¬¨¬¨
03Damos, I have unlimited too
04plus he just loves to disagree with everything
03it's called a phone
it's not a mobile computer. that yis rhe difference
13a phone is not a laptop
03yes, my laptop is a laptop
03:)
13XDDDDDDD
04he changed a newbies avatar to an american flag being burned
o.o
03no, 2
13just like that fantasic 4 movie with that one scene
04hi
03even with like 4 fingers
and only fools are being hacked ;)
03stupid tiny keyboards
hio
13LOL
13imagine if they were tinyer
04i think he used the defense that patriotism is silly
13:3
03they're still smaller than a normal laptop
13almost?
03it doesn't work otherwise, physically
Haha
04i've already been told that is among one of the top insults in germany
04i hear people get killed over being called that
03I do.
All I know is that he takes things too seriously
101% of the time
13that just back fired on you Time
/me hides
04Espeon
eh?
04but when it comes to his actions he's allowed to be all fun and games
04the evidence is in that american flag thing
Yeah, that was quite frankly <censored> up
04for saying a non-swear word
I missed that
04that silly word that was made up in a spam spree
lol
13hey Airy
04kyu was demodded and kicked for saying that word once in front of TS
well that I personally could agree with if it was just a joke, but I guess it wasn't
02That bleugh-somethi?
someone nommed the DNS
04yeah
02somethin*
oh, I remember that xD
13Dns?

....reading through his profile...bleh, this guy's english SUCKS. proves french people speak only two languages
uh
well, french people speak french.....and french
/me cough, stereotype, cough

04as far as time zones are concerned
04actually using timezone rounding theories
I hear that the French are the most stuck-up people in the world
04you think that is bad?
02No

that usually means
also this person appearently hideblocks anyone criticizing him
10lol
10can you see it?
he probably didn't send it to you on purpose
you can't see direct link like http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/161/8/e/Digimon_vs_Pokemon_11_by_Decepticon_3000_RL.jpg this?

ok ok
:D
anyone here use channel forwarders for their games i just need that help and thats all, i used it with wiiflow then i had a wbfs drive but i redid it all to use fat32 and cant get a forwarder to work
http://www.instructables.com/image/FDUJTBRFVW1Z0PZ/Too-cool-Rainbow-Headband.jpg
Maybe it's not supporting fat32.
XD
some code might be half assed.
nice
there is already a boot.dol in apps\cfg loader dir
Replace it
k
i was told it does though but u may be right
Well, don't listen to me XD
12o-o
12no
12anyway Draelen
02and bree, what's a gline?
12want to find out? :P
03it's a network bacn
03*b\an
03why, who's glind?
03*glined
12we were trying to get you glined
12but

lol me sometime
02Roara~
02lol
12Draelen is a burning pile of scales
anyone around to help?
Maybe.
Is anybody here?
if anything looks like it may merit a gline, PM the details to me and I'll get right on it
or any other network issues
i put the shit from \apps in \apps on SD
and copied USB-Loader dir and renamed the cfg56 to boot.dol and put it in apps\cfg loader\boot.dol
Good, now run CFG from HBC or whatever.
ok
PM that to me, I won't add it tonight, but should be able to do that tomorrow
Youll need to poke arti to update nest too
Then try and mount drive from CFG.
TheNOOB u have any idea about channel forwarders for games
Not a clue.
k
Is it really THAT much of a struggle to use the loader?
It takes a whole 10 extra seconds.
lol
thats all
Use HBC.
lol
12i think i'm still glined on nest
ya i read about CRAP a prog to make them tried it and cant get it to work
12XD
lol CRAP?
Epic name.
12dunno
12never checked to see if arti installed the exception
2and now, I take a temporary leave of absence for the sake of filling my hunger with sustenance.
No..
ok
Just ignore it
Choose cancel or whatever
Don't screw around
Accidently formatting = bad.
yeah
no doubt
well esp that drive
i have like 1.5tb of hd movies
I'd just PM |Shadow| if I were you.

02But for half the day I was like "Oh geeze, I don't wanna go to summer school tomorrow..."
12whats the date?
CFG should support NTFS
i use NTFS with CFGLoader
There, a pro!
but shit
i was about to shit myself
02Today's the 10th I guess .-.
02I start on the 12th
i was about to shit myself
er shit
Be careful.
04lol
04i read badly as baldly
and if u are softmodded you shouldnt go DVD-R
XD
ok
DVD-R is slower aswell.
sooo is there any way to not use a GC controller when using bootmii as ios
but Softmod playback with DVD-R is capped at like 3x speed
I believe it's 3x
oh ok
well i guess i have to read into hdd method
burn it and play it
watch the intro stutter
cuz i just about messed up my drive
fo sho
I haven't had a problem with any DVD-R games.
finally someone i know
You guys are just impatient XD
Hey vdChild
can i pm you
Sure
kk
02And I keep reading it as "I want it really badly"
i have a 1TB that has a FAT32 of 30ishGB and then there is about 900GB of NTFS for Wii games
FAT32 is for the homebrew apps/emus and shit
lol
Thats epic.
Makes it easier and you never need the SDcard unless you are loading bootmii
That's*

if you have nand backup ? idk, let us know...
oh i meant 4.2***
sorry
is there any way to play backups on a wii WITHOUT modding the inside?
of course
Kenshou`, yes
?
impossible
this isnt dreamcast
or ps2

yeah
bout to say
aha
i loled
Couldn't think of the word
Avatar is an incredibly slow and boring movie the second time around
Heh
I thought that the first time around to be honest
I liked it the first time
Never seen it
It wasn't /terrible/... I just didn't like any of the characters and the story was really preachy and cliche
Don't plan on it I think
But everything looked really pretty
avatar was still in theaters iirc
and she kept checking reviews online
/me really just liked the scenery and the creativity involving the scenery
Ahahaha
I loved the Morrowind-sense I got from it
The whole time I was watching it I was thinking "Fern Gully"
xD
ahahahahaahha
I loved that movie when I was a kid
/me liked them
yeah
Or the little fairy thing
oh
And the fairies
Then I saw Dances With Wolves after
and it was literally
the
exact
same
story

I always liked something in central park, gnome?

anyone know some good sites to download ebooks
Like, paperback books that have been digitized
Legally?
...
legally... or not.
if you're installing wads to nand, then yes, you can remove them from sd
There's no illegal way to do it -- torrenters don't read
^Wulfgar^, thanks

The only place I have ever seen them is iTunes (I think) and Demonoid
book*
wii softmod
I refuse to install itunes
They banned me
is this correct wulfgar?
I find it hard to read more than a couple paragraphs on a screen anyway
iTunes is spyware
Deadity
I read all day.
Well
/me sticks to books
lemme check
let me try it
I have about a 15-20% success rate with that
oh shit
wow
it needs to be EXT:\wbfs\<in here?>
can i just simply create a folder on ext hdd called 'wbfs'?
yes, lowercase
No success
Oh well.
does the .txt file it creates with it from wii manager need to be renamed?
.txt ?
Maybe ill stop being a cheap skate and spend the $10
lol
heh
Yeah, you'll probably not find it unless it's part of the Twilight series
yeah like it says SDG =
no...you can leave it
ew
unless
or harry potter
ok

/me stokes his beard sagely
6just said goodbye to a close friend once again, cried a few buckets
12don't worry
strokes^
12you can always be more busy
>.>
12o-o
heh
6he's busy with stoofs
I heard it got nerfed quite a bit recently too.
12i figured
that or it was a while ago
12this week has been abnormal for me as well :/
12did i mention the bat?
usb2 is also faster than the wii sd slot afaik
04nerfed?
they made it less effective.
04dunno but its still good
Which games works good on Wii64?
04whats his name?
zilean or something like that
04yeah
Good night everyone
gnitee
04he kept putting bombs on me and i kept cleansing them off XD
he's annoying considering he only has one combat skill
2:10 AM here >.>
i imagine it would take 2 minutes to try it xdpirate
nini Stormy|Sleeping!
rather than asking
6um
6dunno
Haven't downloaded neither the emulator nor the roms because I'd like to know if it works before I do, and if it has good compatibility :)
6I might have been here and saw the conversation, but was quiet
04the bonus was like +70
thats pretty good
04really good
hi
04considering i was hitting turrets and champions for 190
04plus sheen
12hmm
12thursday i found a bat in the house
04rank 5 is 110 + whatever
I dunno much about the statistics <.>
6o-o
04i know i never gotten it that high before
12yes
6yes
12pretty random actually -.-
I thought usb2 should be faster than 6x DVD but wasn't sure ;)
how is that wrong?
6uh...yeah
04let's say it was 70 though
6IN the house?
faster*
04i had to 2 my way upto that
I think I'll go now too gnite
04so that was 35 kills with Siphoning Strike?
yeah
in that case it's dependant on the retail disc too, lots of scratches makes it slow :P
agreed ^
04i have an item that reduces his cooldown by 20
04%
nice.
04something shroud?
guys if i brick and i ave bootmii as boot 2 how do i get into bootmii?
04Glacial Shroudedit this page
boot the wii
power on with reset?
04-edit this page XD
liek u normaly would
with the bootmii sdcard in the slot
lol
ok
dlukz, wrong
oh
<-- guessed :p
wait
04i can't seem to get connected
but, 1. we dont reach full usb2 speed
boot wii with bootmii sd inserted
oh. its down :/
12yes
sucks
2. not all apps support usb2
Miigotu: usb1 is faster already, and usbloaders support usb2
n00b we arnt talking apps
12getting it out of the house was hard as heck as well
04:/
/me squeaks
usbloader = app
/me squeaks back
6ugh
and no, all of them dont support usb2
04i had too much action this week >_>
all don't or not all do?
04thursday
04when i found the bat in the house
not all of them*
04that was just too much excitement
http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d2stnhm
yea wiiflow doesnt
!deshou
wiiflow does ^
u seem like ur not very up to date on ur information
lol
thats not it
hi
its jsut wiiflow is shit
cfg > *
we run the same loading code
loading code isn't all of it
04so... add that to the 190
you have to use it though :/
exactly,
04i know
that's +352 damage.
04wait
04its passive
wiiflow is for kids and people that just want to press A and play a game...which CAN be done in cfgloader as well
most times, but there are factors you need to consider
it nowhere is, regarding the fact I can always put a few wait() into my code :P
its always faster then retail dvd
erm, you havent seen wiiflow lately i guess
04it activates when you use an ability
oh
but thats ok
Miigotu = wiiflow fanboy fucktard imo
and showing roms in coverflow and direct launching them to emulators
on wiiflow
thank u all very much for helping this work
04then again
its too low power/balance
80% of it is rewritten
04so it boosts blow even more
first 'stable' release...lol
i talk to the devs of cfg and gx daily
ehh
gx has uber problems atm
talking != dev
and cfg there is nothing planned
wouldn't you rather just get a +attack item for way less?
cfg and wiiflow use the same exact loader code ^
there's no need to add anything
04true
plus 250% criticals
except we support more thaings now
04it's just that i've been building force
04because i have sheen anyway
the more you 'add' the more to go wrong
also, is it a unique ability? they might not stack
means you don't have the requisite IOS
not if ts added correctly
well apparently that next version of wiiflow aims at doing more than that wulf
good for you
04dunno
04i think i like Warmog more
stats?
and if you think a loader should just load wii games thats ur preference
whether that's good or bad is a matter of personal opinion really
simple enough
!wb NUSD
NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
04+770 Health
04+30 Health Regen (per 5)
^Wulfgar^: that would be my opinion too but that still doesn't make me say bah bah to their efforts
nice
no reason you can't get both though
cfg works for me
04dunno
cfg always works
that -15% damage would be really helpful
04i think i would get warmog early
Also, I think it's trying to get the WAD from the disc itself.
04then work on lifesteal
the point of nandemu is that triiforce gui sucks, and you need to switch apps to look at the rest of ur games
04he starts out with 10% lifesteal though
our aim is all WW,Wii,nes,snes,n64, all in one place in different views
no IOS present
could get starks
install IOS38
helps teammates too
from the disc
04indeed
or nusd?
? list
04i dunno there is too many ways to take this
yeah I get that problem too
it has a good base
04you know ignite might be fun with teemo
04okay take ignites damage AND poison
..and malady
link to wad manager 1.5 pl0x
04malady i believe is the 2nd item i try getting when i teemo
filetrip.net
LOL
04i go for berserkers first
I never really know where to go after that, lol
04lol
http://filetrip.net/f6031-WAD-Manager-1-5.html
that said...
04i certainly like Nasus, i just need to think about how to play him
well, the loader behind each usbloader is custom to each x.X
i'll go with the one on the disc
thankies
:D
hmm
but gx has converted theirs to c++
04i just want a good tank i can play
cfg and wiiflow share the same
I can't play anything melee :(
are you any good with skillshots?
04no
oh :/
04it's just that i think that if i can learn to juggle 2 characters
04it should help win more matches
libwbfs? wbfs_fat?
04there is no point in picking teemo if the other 4 team-mates are also squishies
I need a character that can disable opponents :/
just snag it from cfg source
04no matter how well they play
it has alot of fixes
you sure they care about compatibility to non-wii platforms?
hmm, mb not
you planning on building a lib? lol
04that's why a good tank has a good harassing move
04something to draw their attention
04cho'gath has that one ability
04that makes spikes come from the ground
04feral scream is annoying as well
he has a lot of good debuffs :/
slow, stun, silence
04Rammus XD
he's just annoying D:
doubt*
04i've played him a lot, he can't push for heck
thats why he sits near a tower all the time
04i know
04then if a tower goes down then you have problems
right but for example the sources of wbfs_file (which even was meant for being run on a PC) are suggesting an ancient glibc version from 2008 ;)
I've seen him push when fed, but eh
04Nasus
lol
there must be something in between "completely backwards" and "fully working" ;)
04plus he can always tap into his ulti
i honestly dont know
hmm..
wad I think
04do it :/
ok
'night
04night
wad
12uh oh
:P thats why wad manager keps freezing is i was using the wrong ios
?
why again?
12what was that for
it wasnt fully modded last time
it'd be the same thing if you used the one from NUS
/me rages

Using WiiSCU 0.25 (latest) to update Shop Channel and IOS61 should work okay, isn't it?
hmm "get_nus_object(tmd) returned -1, tmdsize =15" this can't be right

PEBKAC?
also the WiiSCU page doesn't mention that
Which is apperantly not there on the download server
They should all be on the NUSD.
*NUS
Well it fails to download
I picked v19
and that works
Or which version should I pick ?
Then I'll update the wiki
Gimme a sec.
Yeah, v19 seems like the latest
Do they alwaws count down? Or is it pretty randomish ?
I used NUSD and the "latest" button :P
NUSD r96, but the latest button should be in the released versions.

13there
to run homebrew? Yes. To install the HBC? Not easily.
How hard?
Quite a few risky and possibly illegal instructions to follow - it involves installing hacked IOSes and downgrading others.
...
That means really difficult
pretty much.
well it's doable
you just gotta take a risk
i should go try it
What's the worst case scenario?
you ahve a brick
Mm, brick.
bricks have been shat
not really illegal
seeing as how you're not in anyway modifying it
it's been signed by ninty themselves
lol
:P
Downgrade?
lol
not games
IOS
no difference
oh uploading them
no no not hosting them
just because they aren't selling them doesn't mean you have any more rights to host them
downloading them is a different thing
yeah, exactly
can you downgrade?
downloading from NUS is fine
oldtopman: Again, not easily - the method I described above IS basically a partial downgrade
oldtopman
you can get IOS41 from nusd
and isntall that
and from there
you can get IOS15 downgarded and then get a working IOS36
but it all involves risk
Thanks then. I can wait.
you eff up you have a brick
but i'm a risk taker
i'd do it anyway
i can afford another $$$ for a wii
rosch: well, actually, that's unlikely to brick. That's about as likely as installing the HBC to brick, IMHO.
03it's just drf
03no y, no ie
/me runs
i guess i should try doign it myself
lukegb: Sure, if you do it 100% correctly it's unlikely to brick
2lol
the only IOS you'll need
is systemmenu + systemmenu IOS
2hi drf
even if you don't brick, you could still end up with a Wii that won't play some games
or doesn't support SDHC
03hi
lol of course
but that's why i < 3 dop-mii
handles all that crap for me
bah nobody's selling a wavebird

/me puts my hands up
Never mind.
and to tell how good the card is? XD See how far you can push it by running 3D games until it crashes
that's all I can think of
........[censored]........
/me slowly walks closer
it has to run them PROPERLY
I'm gonna guess that since it's old, it's not going to work very well
/me perches on Stryker's head :(
04what version do you have Quilava?
I don't know...
aah
:(
/me pets the... pet Curly.
Well if it can't run them at all, then I guess that's how good it is ovo

I find this band GUILTY of Rockin' and rollin'!
/me could have some fun with this joke
:D
Hey

:D
/me high fives!
:D
thanks
most welcome
glad to have made someone's day

/late reply
04hmm
I can't see like the left sixth of the screen now.
04interesting
I guess you don't know which one is included...
I should just switch the cards from my computers..
if I knew how <.<
I think he used to be one of the rolling stones
*waits to be killed for not knowing about some famous person*
04u
I don't want to pay money for it >.>
and some other song they used to play constantly on the radio
:P
How come the military bad guys in movies are always colonels?
Because all colonels are evil!
Even Jack O'Neill!
04hold on
then everyone would just be making jokes
i do know
they played it on the bus a lot when I was in grtade school
i packed it myself
I don't think I know it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_My_Life_(Bon_Jovi_song)
DCFG it has
click the sample button
my computer has been really slow lately
D:
wait I need those!
/me jumps after them
stupid netbook
:P
jk, I'm sorry Stormy's netbook
Oh, that song
?downgrade
? downgrade
all the more reason for the upgrade
oh look, he's a li9beral
:P
how nice
I don't think Bon Jovi was in rolling stones
nah he wasn't, I just looked him up
I think he was just called bon jovi and he was one of those 80's glam bands
04not fully sure
he seems old enough though
lol
:P
what's a li9beral?
linineberal
a liberal x9
:P
...scary
not loading stub ios
lol
actually it's a typo
/me stays away from him
a liberal x9 is called a "Josef Stalin"
XD
anyone have a problem with wii motion plus instructional videos not playing?
sometimes refered to as a "Fidel Castro" on occasion
because my processor was 1.6Ghz and ram was 1GB
which is terrible.
but more commonly known as a "commie pig"
plus it had vista
04that vista has
I did
it still ate a lot
just a little bit less
yeah :/
04i see
dropped from like 60% to 50% usage
Vista even without the addons that you can disable is a memory hog
it's very poorly coded
blarg
now I have that song stuck in my head
04*someone
oh no
Ugh, *was
04its not really an operation you can just... phone in
:P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7PeePWNpQY
The song in that review
I could look it up online and see how complicated it is.
User-X use a launcher with alt dol support
D:
have it start player.dol
:P
should start
jk, I'll watch
if its as simple as adding/removing RAM I can do it myself
it says "peep" in the link\
watch the motion plus vid and you should be good to go after that
like the noise a chick makes
04by all means try
that song has some of the most ridiculous lyrics ever
oh... I absolutely HATE that song
D:
oh, we're going now
aww
byes
bye
*knew
success!
I'd have to actually hook it back up and check
04lol
system updated to 4.1, and loads dvdr games through the disc channel
huzzah!
when I run the homebrew channel, should I still say 'no' to the update?
04got to be curious though
oh shiiiieeeeeeet
/me pokes her coke
:D
D:
I'll check before I change them, if its possible for me to do
For example, in Avatar, in A Few Good Men
Ummm
/me thinks
The Hurt Locker?
04hmm
Inglorious Basterds
04i think it'd be the best benefit to check
Inglourious Basterds*
its as easy as changing RAM.
but I don't have an anti-static wristband.
Andras dun leik mispellings

Step 5: Removing the old card
Locate the old card on the motherboard and remove it by firmly lifting it out of the slot it occupies.

There's three types of fouls in FIFA: careless, reckless, and excessive force
Careless == overstepping fair play
Reckless == acted with complete disregard to the safety or consequences of the player
Now:
But we have the luxury of high speed cameras, and we know that the player was trying to take him out
right
Sooooooo
I don't feel very bad about it
Referees get a conditional pardon on this one
On closer inspection, there's no attempt to play the ball
He lucked out on that one
Oh wait a minute
I take back my pardon
Yeah
OH!
He had a player in the way
Referees don't have x-ray vision
Quit doing that >:

Isn't letting me boot from the CD
Basically
03oh

the Mt Kosciozsko mountain range
03In BIOS
I thought all computers were different?
6Aura Sphere is a Fighting type move. Lugias are Psychic/Flying. ovo
03try o.o
Mine is only F9, F10, F12
Tried it
didn't work
03Try F1
tried
03Try various F buttons then :<
03XD
Going to try that XD
F11
03And Boot options should be there
F11 works 4me
Speaking about refereeing >.>
Nothing worked
Apparently, there was a group of teenagers there
03And odd, I think my BIOS is borked on my main laptop
At the soccer field :3
I don't think I have access to my BIOS
Or it's retarded
F9 = Boot Device Menu
03And you have to try as soon asit restarts o.o
03Try that
F10 = ROM Based Setup
/me didn't have a good feeling at that point
F12 = Network Service Boot
03And move CDROM to first o.o
Tried F9
oh
hang on
o.o
Or my CD is screwed up
6All right.
We are not all hostile
6But how's that fic going?
Probably that lol
I'm slightly hostile
depends on my mood
And I was thinking "I should have brought my gun"
Why didn't you
Usually no one is there

It's inside the computer
/me didn't feel good at all at that point
I think it's built in
Why didn't you leave at this point
i feel like i have a hangover yet i havent drank anything
hm
Didn't want to look like I was running away, didn't want to risk them chasing me :P
/me just followed his routine
if a hangover feels the way I imagine it does I feel that way too
But I had one hand on the trigger and one hand on my phone :P
woo
Slow cop response time and pepper spray
I'd rather run
/me tries del

It should

Either the CD is <censored> or the CD drive is bad

the limit is like 11
oh

Then they go um...no
It cant be concealed above that length
I'll try it on my other comp
I'd rather have a gun

Unfortunately, the gun I have isn't easy to run in
03You burned it? o.o

My friend has a license to have one anywhere but schools

thanks

04I really hate it how schools give out assignments to do over the holidays
04I have two assignments to do and a reading/writing task to be done
04it's goddamn bullshit

04
Lol
04how is that even possible
04?
12Theguesst how goes
lol
I haven't gotten holiday assignments
8D
All goes well
Or if I did
12i see
bbl
12i have a headache
I probably wasn't listening
/me runs
I received my bronzong I ordered
And that's too bad
:(
04no
12i have a good feeling
How'd you get it?
12snow play
The headache, that is
04atm I wish I never told my mum I had assignments
.-.
damn
doesn't matter
12if used right
12a single belted abomasnow can take out 2 donphans
Something assistive, maybe
12if they are belted or not
Like nidoqueen
12i would play it with bronzong
12MD
And that
Hmm
12actually before nidoqueen existed
12that was a deck
12but the problem is that nidoqueen rapes that idea
Heh
12i currently play abomasnow with http://pokegym.net/gallery/displayimage.php?imageid=48223
omnomnomnomnom
I know
12because expert belt for 1 grass energy, does 50 and makes you draw 2 cards to make up for the fact that you no longer have claydol
12but still, 50 damage drains away fast in nidoqueen's presence
I really cant think of a viable alternative right now

there are some articles that are gems still
thats why i quit useing a reader for usenet
all the fucking spam
and went only nzb's
I read headers for MP3s all the time.
/me first time ever reading headers ;)
:D
Heh. I remember WAY back in the day before there were even programs to decode te files for you.
I want a dsi xl and I don't want to deal with crazy craigslizt people
No.
:D
Why not wait for the 3DS?
well call up gaystop and aks
NO
No
/me hides behind Curly

NO! >:O
/me is tossed Dx
/me catches Curly
:O
pissing me off
/me looks over at Curly in Proto's arms
:3
as well as 3ds
yeah, my ds lite R button is not working that well
but I'd like to wait for 3DS also
march '11
too long, maybe there's a promo to trade in towards a DSi XL
Maybe sooner.
12is there a catch?
yuyuyup, has to be a fully working system for gamestop to take it in a tade-in
2Roara
2are slurpies tasty?

XENOGEARS:)
I read a review on RPGamer. It's really different.
nah fuck p3

pakigirl
now go get it
Perseid

I'm not sure I'd hve the patience or it now, though.
*for
ITS REALLY LONG
Unskippable cutscenes with unskippable text.
LOLLLLLLL
xenogears is 80 hour
First time took me 52 I think.
LOL
and pakigirl is a girl LOL
*far
yeahhh
sigh
xenogears= 108 hour
i dont think she is on the same track with u |Shadow|
i responded
her train left hours ago
Perseid
u finished xenogears?
pakigirl
Yeah. 52 hours.
pakigirl
wow

Yeah. I remember the plot fairly well.
no
ok
remmeber
Miang?
Yeah.
wow u remmeber:)
pakigirl
good memories
I'd buy a modernized remake of that. Too bad that'll never ever happen.
the graphic look like ff tactic
Bedteim
still good
Perseid

~~~~\o/\o/~~~~~^~~~~
>:D
:O
\:O/
oh
that reminds me of one of the lifeguard contest exercises
everybody starts "drowning" at the same time
xD
Expodential growth ftw \o/
I think that would fail you
:o
for all we know they might not know how to swim :O
But.... it's math :o
And maybe I just have cramps or something
MATHS WINS.
PERIOD
I ate a lot of food and jumped in
f(x) = 2^x \o/
I never got the hang of functions >.>
or at least... if I did I forgot
It's the same as y = 2^x :3
y = f(x)
okay
LOL thats interesting to put it in the books
04?
then after 3 mins there are 50 people
I don't think math applies in such a basic way in this kind of situation >.>
Curly: It doesn't
find the constant of proportionality
"Green Emperor way where tower touches"
all from the beginning words in the commentaries
they do :o
xD
04lolwut
/me takes the derivative for the heck of it
If you can't take the derivative of something, it's not worth paying attention to it anyway
DIFFERENTIATE THAT MOTHERFKER
>:|
language >.>
hold on, need moar decoding
i left a u out
On purpose
:3
that's like half the letters
I can tell
:o
And Rule #9 addresses that
/me brbs
ohkay then
/me promises to be a good buy
boy
>.>
/me is not for sale or rent >.>
awwws
04lol
or make the AI use its
:P
in any case, its a good riddle XD
And
since if you noticed in the book, every single word at the beginning of a paragraph in those books has its letter in an incewased, daedric style writting
f'(x) = 2x^(x-1)
04lol
:3
o.o
Want me to take a second order?
I'll do it
Just dare me
i dare you
:o
:o
I don't
and i think you'll like the Fast travel since you've placed morrowind :P
wait
How'd you do 2^x
uh
Power rule :3
04lol
0^0
ie nx^(n-1)
can't do it
Oh, wait, you're right, my bad >.<
/me is sleepy
lolmathsfail
>:D
since it has none right?
:(
'sleepy'
>I don't know how it works and want a way out of this
Don't be
04yep
/me knows how it works but doesn't want to do anything more complicated than the power rule right now
:D
/me unbrbs
Hi Curly!
hi hi :D
hey curly
hi hi #2 :D
hi!
hi hi the sequel :D
:D
/me takes the derivative of where
oops
:D
mmmmmmm, pie
D:
Mwahahaha
But
which reminds me of a very lulzy maths joke
/me leans in and whispers
It's just the derivative :3
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
e^x: "Wat ?"
and the differential operator grins and answers: "Hi. I'm d/dy".
/me facepalms into his keyboard
Sorry for the swearing
I forgot to change it out of it
http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=C6848
look
a distraction
if only you could mod it D:
(face*palm)+keyboard?
I think there's one that gives fast travel..though I havent searched since I'm not one to get morrowind yet
(face*palm)^keyboard
lol
The physicist: "One of the two measurements wasn't very accurate."
The biologist: "They have reproduced".
Heard it
Two atoms are walking down the road, one says:
"I think I lost an electron"
"Are you sure?"
"Yeah, I'm sure"
Hehe
where: You did it wrong.
No i didn't ;p
It's "Yeah, I'm positive!"
You thought it was going to be the other joke
but it wasn't!
>:D
or the volume of a pizza with radius z and height a
(pi)(z)(z)(a)
= pizza
/me has killed the channel D:
:3
/me overloaded with math
/me is not an overloadable function D:
:O
/me gives up on programming for tonight.
beep boop
Oh, and
log(2)2^x
That's the derivative?
f'(x) = log(2)2^x
fffffffffff
Go on.
that should make it clear
where did you find that?
That derivative
And I aught to be off doing something useful now
/me goes off to do some learndings
;3
:3
04sigh Quilava
04XD
?
04i got paired up with a team and i literally got like 98% of the kills

04then the rest were 0
:D
04of course i lost
04i should of screenshoted that >_>
/me has no idea how we're going to assign these order to specific nicks.
well at least you can play it functionally
/me sighs.
D:
Shaymin is no longer nice. :(
:(
/me yawns.

er cat
04no
04Guild Wars?
04it's a DotA mimic
lol
04Defense of the Ancients?
04from Warcraft 3?
04oh come on
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikm3o5hDks&feature=related
awww
a rat and cat are friends
04I suck at that too
04yeah
04Drake
04but it's still fun
04trust me
04Arcanine
04it doesn't matter
04calm down
is it?
04Soyuz
04like AoE
then its an RTS
04only based in the WoW world
Real time strategy
04ah
04only
04in the World Editor
since you know...FPS
etc
etc
04alot of people
play it?
ONline? :P
04make maps where you only control a single unit
04then share them online etc
04to a more WoW gaming style
hmm...
04?
/me is focused on trying to properly install the mod DDD:
curses, this is difficult
04lol
04i remember when you didn't want to play matches
04because you couldn't win
04heh
04yeah
04back when I was a whining sod
its hard to properly bring this into creation XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ficwZQYmRLE&feature=related
aww
since if you do something wrong
whats with the gay vids?
Open cities :O
Is this the open cities mod I've been hearing about?
04open cities?
TerrorBite
yes
these
04oh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ikm3o5hDks&feature=related - a rat and cat are friends
wait
no not open cities
apparently |lucid| hates cuteness :p
Open cities removes loading screen from cities
But in any case; Its the hardest mod to download
it literally tells you if you're computer is too old
or you're a starter for mods
it basically says' <censored> you n00b"
04lol
and you need the OBBM
I'm still level 1?
04lol
and I don't have any mods installed :o
you just escaped the prision right>
*?
ok, take my advice
you'll need to go to Elder Scrolls nexus and join their forum
to get every mod
or at least be able to download
Nao
though for the actual mods
others you can't
I'm semi good at RTS, whats the situation?
TerrorBite; but I say now
get LTDVampire overhaul
enough said~
04o-o
04i have bad luck?
04i keep getting paired up with bad players
eh?
Histuff.
hi
04it's not only RTS
Hi Andres
Hmm..
well then best advice I can offer
then kill everyone :D
04actually nvm I have to go
No I havent
/me facerolls
Andres!
Let us explode! :D
Okay, yes?
Boooring.
/me just explodes then.
:O
Dang
took things and blue with him
Andres used explosion
TerrorBite; well some of the mods I have
you need the SI
(shivering Isles)
or other things
wait...
or other?
well for starters
you're level one
scamps
and lesser other beings
with some Dramora
+ you
but bad story
you get stronger
but I dont blame ya
blade
blunt
conjuration
destruction
and illusion + sneak and security
best skills
and most often used
Security is DB and TG
and others
like main quest
Blade is for every faction
Blunt, same thing
04my last 10 matches
04i've only won twice
DDDD:
04Arcanine
04it's called insignificant
its honor and glory?
04excuse me but
/me /drama
'every game'?
04oh...ha
04hahaha
04whatever
like for instance
or I accidently burnt my hand
04which yeah, information is valuable
/me idles
/me shrugs
04Soyuz
04if you accidentally did it
04what does learning from it prove?
learning from it that I need to be paranoid and wear protection
or if I was say 5
I'd stay away the <censored> near it
04solutions aren't always that easy
04in fact solutions are rarely ever that easy
lose the flag? lose the HQ?
Ok
04there is this building that you can't get destroyed or else you lose
or army?
I've played some RTS which is kinda like you're playing
04i
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends#Gameplay
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends
Title: League of Legends - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
this?
04maybe
and have a amount of magic and health
and different attritubes determining the person in total
right?
04that made no sense
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV2rRcskn4Y
04there aren't two league of legends games
though its kinda like BfME
*BFME 2
04i can't answer that
04because i can't find a logical explanation other than i have horrible luck
I really dont believe in luck
04and 90% of the time it always feels like either i get paired up with sucky people
Then think out battle plans first?
or tell the sucky people to take good positions?
04i'm not that good with tactics
Then Ask me
I'm fairly well with RTS
04heh
04makes no difference
04i quit LoL
Ok
hows it going?
04which one
the 2nd one
04not descriptive enough
04so i'll just say them all
04MM i gave up on
04TP i haven't touched in awhile
how about the one with the evil moon?
04that is MM
04there was this one part i couldn't get past
04oh well
04i had no choice there
02gewt MGS4 :O
04i downloaded it
02yeah..game codes
02in which you have to call peoples
04i have MGS4
02because its a good series?
04exactly
04if you played one of the later games of a series
02the played the 3rd
04i played 1 when i was a kid
02finally finished the 4th after some months it came out
04never finished t
02did you beat it? :O
04it
02oh
04then skipped to 4
02well play 2nd or 3rd
04i don't have a PS2
02o3o
04had one
04actually i had two
04bought one, it broke
04bought a second one
02that eventually broke
04it broke, gave up buying them
02well the bigger ones
02will break
02mine ladted 3 years
02and I still have my smaller one
02or 4..
02i dont even remember
04i'm surprised the smaller ones are more durable
04but i'm not going to buy a PS2 anyway
04even if there are plenty of games that well yeah
04that i liked for PS2

U R A cellphone
wow go back to joke school
dude look
don't be jealous of my jokes
srzly
was a pretty good joke
it may be...it only does it when I put in certain games
how do I go about fixing that problem
you're playing out of region games....that's why they're flickering
disc
neogamma?
what's up Wulfgar...how are you?
yes..R8 actually
see if you can force the region
How? I tried everything..it just keeps going back to the regular config
Flickering/stutter is due to the speedcap of Softmod DVD-R speed cap
Softmodded Wii using DVD-R has a speed cap
of like 3x
a softmod reads dvds a LOT slower than hardmod
and the modchip is like 6x
the crazy thing is...when I have the system at my house, it works fine..as soon as I take it back to the owner, it does that with certain games...the same games that worked at my house flawless on the same system
Its not flawless if its softmodded using DVD-R
fair enough...but it doesn't do it when it's at my house..only when I take it back to the owner
Choochoo, not possible
be back soon
if it stutters at a certain point, it'll do that no matter where you take it or hook it up
well, then again..my sytem is hard and softmodded..never though of that
softmod cancells out the hardmod
until you fucking DIE
and then the tv goes from ntsc to pal
softmod doesn't cancel out ALL hardmod...just most of it
Wulfgar, you still with me
nothing
I didn't install priiloader
priiloader has nothing to do with stuttering

http://designfabulous.blogspot.com/2010/07/htc-1.html <- Nice ohone concept but
*phone
Scroll down and look at the UI mockups
In particular, the News screen
but does it have it or not ?
why does it matter?
why do you want to update to 4.2?
do the 4.2 softmod
which menu are you on?
its not easier, its more work
its not..
i fount it much easyer
seems less ideal than the current HTC UI
but i maybe do use some pl
old methid
method
sorry bad english
yes
That or go back in time and don't update.
ok.. is there onother way to do an update ?
let say from 3.4 to 4.1 ?
Maybe, but look what's on the news screen
? list
? softmod
updating to 4.2 is just DUMB
all depends
if u modded for a dumb neighbour/friend
ppl are dumb ^Wulfgar^ as you well know
no... priiloader, block updates...job done
as far as i am aware no games currently do that
as I said... updating to 4.2 is dumb... use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide, you'll end up on 4.1...priiloader block updates, job done
you could update from 3.1 to 4.2 with safe updater
sd only
there is a 4.1 safe updater as well :P
can i download 4.1 systemfiles to SD ?
plus. you can buy 4.2 now in stores :(
no reason to go to 4.2
no technical reason no
ive got 4.2
purely to insist on it being 'n00b friendlier'
"ewww why you got the old system menu, you do realise 4.3 is out now"- says the technoob
"ok lets update it" - says the ubernoob
ohh cool
my mini is here !!!
gtg guys , got a Mini Carbio 2010 edition :p , lorry pulling up now !!!
/me gone for the night !
|lucid| tel me more about NUSD, where can I read about it...?
zdx, why use NUSD when you can use the damn updater?
because i dont have wiifii
wifii
wifi*
thaks :)
you'd have to download ALL the ios's as well as the system menu...will take ages
can i do it from homebrew browser?
i havnt looked
i just installed the browser right now
elmagico, go look then
oh
opera is there
i dont have it I¥m just about to run to the store to buy it, and i dont whnat to waste my money, that why i whant to find out
never heard of goggle.com, eh?

I want toribash
for wii?
its out?
today
WOAHHHH!!!!
FINALLY
hahaha
look for the wad
it'll be out eventually
damnit
i need 500 more wiipoints
plus system update 4.3
or the updated shop cahnnel
you are the worlds biggest failure
harsh words there
just joshing around
cause I'm smoking marijuana
toribash looks incredibly boring
lmao
i got an answer
how do people get the wads?
lets hope they match
meth isn't hep
out of the channels?
you can od on methj?
must take alot
like they buy toribash, how do they extract the wad?
maybe torrents i don't know
me too
6I'm flipping out about how unorganized my music files are right now
6but ugh, that's too many to organize
6I don't think I want to see the movie, tbh
6but then again...I kinda do ._.
any one got the 4.3 downgrade to work?
16 of the 17 wads fail to install
can anyone help?
lol
excuse me?
damn racist.
why did you upgrade it in the first place then
and read the guide, the process works fine for downgrading
followed to the letter
some guide told you to upgrade to 4.3?
i highly doubt that unless it was a joke
lol
the down grade doesnt work
not for mine
it does work
never tried it with fat32
ahh for real, this shit is a bitch
do you have correct files Mark0990
just downloaded R6
that work
this months ver
step one is to get into MMM. That works
umm i installed them as wads from gbatemp and even made my own
step 2 is to install wads
it says.....
-Select "Load another IOS" -press A
done
if anyone knows please help out
it then says.....
-Select ios250, or 222/223 or perhaps or others
less than $1.5 :)
if I select any of these it says "not loading stub IOS"
i like how it shows the disc spiining etc
umm do i need to point out a folder in cfg or some shit to get forwarders to work?
Blackwolf, any ideas?
just make sure you have the proper files
proper ios etc
:( :(
4.3 isn't a guarantee softmod/hack...it doesn't work for some people...which is why you shouldn't have upgraded in the first place
the files all came in the pack o the guide :(
which is alos why there is no 4.3 guide on the bots
also*
? list
DOH!
I have that IOS41 v3348. Is it possible to downgrade and IOS?
eh?
downgrade is bad, mmkay
only forwarder I use is for cfgloader
no i guess not just like how they look in their own little boxes
ya i hear that, any idea where i can find some good themes for it. Only thig i have seen is a page with like 12 lame ones
Cobra, forwarders suck up mad memory on wii
the wads that CRAP creates are only 8mb
CobraX83, just use the 'return_to_channel
feature of cfg
and set priiloader to boot cfg...
then you'll always be in cfg
wait one sec let me check that out
return_to_channel = forwarderID
/me waits for impending tornado
where do i set this at menu where bootmii can be written or dumped etc?
you set it in the cfg config file
use the configurator for cfg
? priiloader
know of a site with a good amount of cfg themes>?
try ? list
? list
thanks
looking for a priiloader guide i finally got a router and want to setup the wii for the net but don't want my sister to accdiently update
www.google.com
? brickblocker
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Preloader/Priiloader
you work for them?
hahaha
whats this brickblocker same thign?
no
? brickblocker
priiloader is full of hacks...one of which is to block updates
brickblocker is to remove the updates from games before burning them
ooooh ok seeing as how i don't burn games and just use wbfs manager i guess i don't need that
fat32 > *
well ya i found out later that ntsc is supported but oh well
you mean ntfs
hahaha ya my bad
problem with wbfs is that you can't even scandisk the drive
or defrag
it's hardly possible to fragment it though
sure it is...add/remove games...
now you're fragmented
oh right, in my mind I thought of a world where all isos are same size *coughs*
and the size of .wbfs files varies even more
hi
how do i successfully choose a cheat in cfg?
CobraX83, you realize cheaters suck, right? and that you CAN get banned online for using cheats
T00lM4N, use fat32...nothing is bigger than 4gb for wii
CobraX83, you need to 'save .gct'
updating firmware is possible now?
would i still be able to use wbfs manager to load my games or how would i go about doing that?
mapd, never update beyond 4.1
T00lM4N, convert .iso to .wbfs with wii backup manager
Wulfgar just doing it to beat bald bull ( :
T00lM4N, you can find the latest version of wii backup manager here: http://tinyurl.com/wiibackupmanager
thanks ^Wulfgar^ gonna try and tackle this priiloader first, am i going to need my sd card or can i do it by loading it on my hard drive through my fat32 parition?
sd
4.2u
when i bought my wii it came with that on it
then go back to the 4.2 guide and follow the steps for priiloader
? list
? softmod
ahhh doesn't seem that complicated at all
the readme scares me the guide is nicer
ok thx ^Wulfgar^
you have bootmii as boot2?
as an ios
Sina3, http://www.slyck.com/Newsgroups_Guide
Nice Zebra Bitch
no!
in terms of wii channels
someone gave me a toribash download link
there is no nzb as a wii channel
an nzb is for usenet
oh sorta like a torrent?
kinda
i got it from here
http://d6c89a5b.thesefiles.com/
do you even have usenet access?
no
probably not
then you can't even use it
|lucid| well i don't even use my sd card anymore, i made a fat32 parition on my hd and just have my apps through there
T00lM4N, I'd make the whole drive fat32
screw wbfs
no
chances of bricking with priiloader is pretty slim
/me is away -( just gone..bbl )- at 02:17p -( P:Off / L:On )-
in that case fuck that
i rather not install priiloader
only reason i really want to connect my wii to the net is to download covers
just turn wiiconnect24 off
you can still download covers
Kyuuuuuuuhai~ O:
Tool
password protect you net
bb-q it is
then dont tell sis password
bb-q but once i set it she wouldn't have to re-enter it
you dont leave the wii setup to connect, just delete when you are done getting covers
takes 2 secs to restup
a bad wad file install
good point bb-q
seriously
thats pretty much it?
yeah, if you dont run burned games, you should be ok
k ya just thats why i didn't want to install priiloader from the beginning
i'm just scared i'm gonna fuck it up
i'll just do as you suggested, connect24 off and delete my connection after i'm done getting covers
i don't give a hoot about playing any games online
/me sits all over Aero's tablet

but as long as i just play wii games i can leave it in, or?
6lol
Soljarag, i tried that but it sucked, put it at bottom now
6compared to others, it's not much
6but if you think about it
46"
I prolly have about 2 months
is yours wall mounted?
/me runs
yes
6lol
I have about a day and a half just in iTunes music LOL
and that's like 5% of my total music
about 1m above ground
how do u have it on the bottom?
6meh
using the sticker pads that came with my wii
i have it top mounted on my 46", actually i just rest the bar on the actual tv
12rawra
the plastic stand thingy broke
and it works fine
mine was not working well when sitting on the floor
6breeeeee
i wouldn't think it'd work well when sitting on the floor
it's supposed to be either directly above or directly below
it works fine now
12lol
well.. i have it on top now... but its wayyy off... I'm like pointing 3 feet higher than its showing
Soljarag: did you change the setting in the menu
to above the tv instead of below
yep
hmm, maybe try turning off the lights? i've noticed certain types of lights can interfere
bstock: me sitting on the floor, not the bar
i sit on a futon to play
5cm above ground
i dunno... its really odd how much it is off
try put it below
the sticker pads work well
and the bar is only 2" from the screen
whe- oh
yeah.. i may have to rig something.... my screen has a wierd frame
philips?
i have the samsung
my friend has c650 40" samsung
bstock the plastic stand really is a joke
yeah that's why mine just lays on the top of the tv heh
Soljarag, not sure if it suits ur needs but u can use candles instead of the bar
a girl i know does that
ha, really?
yea
4SPLIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!!!!!!!!†
two candles
Orly?
the "sensor bar" is just two IR lights
yeah.. i think tv's should have them built in...
heh
x86 isfor 32bit
x64 is 64bit
thanks LiThIuMx

well... it worked great when i had my tv on the stand.. and i had it below the tv....

I do ocean.lugia.us
ha
yeah.. replace it with a LED
Reshiraaaam O:
all dlp is rear projection
/me torch
and they're not that nice
XD
yeah but it's a far cry from the old 60" rear projection tv's, with like a 6¬∞ viewing angle
12cough
led sux for games
but they're no where near as good as a Kuro
i tested like 5 up to 4000eu range
if you don't mind settling for a tv, I guess dlp is ok
they're also prob 1/5 the price
CRTs ftw
i had a crt-hd until recently
i have 2-yr-old lcd and it's fine for me
a 50
nice for non hd consoles
I imagine alot of things are "fine for you"
good up to 720p
a 50" crt would need a metal reinfored stand
i had 32" crt-hd it weighed 50kg
oops
anyone use a wireless sensor bar?
think you picked up his point of view pretty well
Soljarag i do
how long do batterries last?
no, there are good values out there, I just don't find rear projection to be one of them, base on its inherant weaknesses
Soljarag: we had some at work, were fine, but annoying to change batteries
and have to turn them on all the time
ya Soljarag the batteries don't last very long
but just get rechargeable and u are good to go
no
plus with rear projection, have to occasionally buy bulbs as well
you have a wii at work?? where do u work?
bestbuy
Soljarag: no, we used wiimotes and a sensor bar though for custom application
ha, ok
???
wierd

no help for cios
>.> i'm trying to run netflix without waiting a week for a disc in the mail
i downloaded the netflix disc iso
but can't get it to work
just wait
we can't help you
those steps lead to piracy
do you know where i can get help?
it's not up to me
yes and no
telling you would be helping you
lol
good thing athenon is asleep
he would've kbed you right away
unelss we summon him
ATHENON ATHENO NATHENON
lol
haha i was just kidding
:P
if you want to direct people to gbatemp i dont mind
warpedflash = warbles?
lol
warbles!
!kban arimil
Athenon with his banhammer of evilness
hehe :)
ughh
i'm -.-
give it the fuck up
hah
/me rages.
why?
to word wrap text
just write one
its like 4 lines
u can always direct them to another channel to get them out of here
Warpedfla
how is that much longer than 4 lines?
do it in pseudocode
oh let's say you don't have \n
hows it been going?
why would you not have \n or endl or something?
then it's not possible
cause GRRLIB_PrintfTTF doesn't have it
it's not an IO stream
i've written one wordwrap before
it's ugly and gross
it's in FLM
k, in java its still the same....just instead of \n you just increment the y value by a set amount
http://code.google.com/p/fmylife/source/browse/trunk/FMyLife/source/fmylife.cpp
scroll down to... drawText()
that's pretty much how i have to do it
i can simplify it a little now
since i can get the width of a line of text
still gotta break the line of text into words
that looks roughly how i'd do it...
i dont see how thats all uber complicated though ;P
lol it's just ugly and > 4 lines
i can make roughly the same method in java in half the lines xP
java is easier
i have StringTokenizer
stringtokenizer is dumb
ever since scanner came out, tokenizer is antiquated
or scanner
or whatever it's been awhile
strings are a pain in c++....one of the reason its not exactly my language of choice
oh, and re: 4 lines....i bet its right around there when using java and regular console output ;P
ill just put that entire drawText() func on one line and claim its way shorter than you say :D
lol

now learning c#
u8?
u16?
unicode is 16
You mean 8 bits?
yes
although unicode is more than 16 bits i think ja?
16 bit
looking at my c# study guide
utf-8 is extendable to 4 byes, actually
0-65535
FFFUUU buffer overrun
wait no youre right
hahaha
it's 0-65535
yeah
65536 different chars
although.....
Yeah. using a unsigned int
If I was wrong, then this book would be wrong, lol.
Perseid somehow those numbers dont sit well with me
its 32 bits though...4 bytes....max though
what's wrong with this
http://pastebin.org/391601
night all
Gandalph: given the atrocities ive seen in my data structures and structure of programming languages books...i wouldnt be surprised
Yeah I've seen a few messed up books.
should be entitled to a lot more $
oh look we have a Node....lets make its left and right children both public!
stupid pieces of crap
comcast just doesnt want to pay out
i don't really see anything wrong
:/
i know hwat i did wrong
yeah
I dunno. I don't know much about it. I only pasted it to inform Comcast customers that they have a free $16 waiting for them.
all i know
Athenon: that sucks
it's hanging on that part
wait
Oh, they paid out. It just went mostly to the lawyers, as it always does in class-action suits.
hmmmmmmmm
3 million to lawayers it said
is it GRRLIB_WidthTTF's fault?
$13 to customers
http://grrlib.santo.fr/doc/group___all_func.html#ga0d6122453e44eca5d0defaa66d01b55b
maybe
mill*
less than a million customers
no
oh wait
you FAIL
lol
utf-8 is 32 bits..........2^32=4294967296
idk...im starting to care less and less tbh xP
Hmm. Perhaps they could have afforded more after all. "Total equity $ 42,721 million (2009)"
i have
ever try to write to run an interpreted language
with only 3 8-bit registers
it's not fun
it drives you mad
ive written in assembly....that was pain enough for me
have you written in 6502 assembly
MAD I TELL YOU
/me <3 6502 assembly
rosch: you fail
yup
NO YOU
i wrote for nes
it's awesome
mad? MAD?
http://members.shaw.ca/jparasite/lol6502/stdlib.65s
not too easy, but fun
for nes, wasn't that assembly I read then.
aww, all it needs is comments
i wrote that
it's not even done yet
i went MAD
that's just the standard libary
oh
i made an LOLCODE to 6502 compiler
Athenon, doesn't that just mean it can be expanded to utf-32?
hah
6502 is nice
i'm working on picross
Gandalph: nah, its a different standard i believe
if i'm using wchar_t
how do i tell this stupid thing
to switch to a different language
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4355351/tpwpong.nes
like "USE JAPANESE CHARSET" or whatever
I'm playing picross 3d. challenging.
eek
is it safe to delete the hackmii folder on the sdcard?
yup
lol
I'm watching hell's kitchen :)
or rather the folder says bootmii
rosch: dunno
If you don't want to use bootmii, then delete it. ;)
bah
why does charmap show "!" as 33
but in printf it's 32
i'm ertarded
also once it's modded I don't need the boot file anymore do i?
Depends if you want to boot into bootmii or not, should something go wrong.
best to just rename the folder.
You could have 2 SD cards
sure
iirc tho
And what's the app, rosch?
i'm trying to get unicode to work
you can config it to automatically boot the sysmenu
bootmii folder is only a few kb in size. no need to delete.
from 32 to 512
use autoboot
there's an .ini file
uncomment out the autoboot
rename the folder then.
wouldn't that defeat the purpose of it being there though? since you can't use it then
*shrug* i guess
autoboot it is :p
Arimil: you can press a certain button and it'll boot into it
with autoboot on
thought the wiimote didn't work in there
athenon or whoever
do you know how unicode is handled
when GET an html page
Arimil: no no I mean
with a gc controller or on the wii buttons
like hold the eject button while turning it on?
yeah
or reset
idk which
i'm just trying to think
if i do a GET using sockets
ok thanks everyone
Oh, by the way, I decided to pick back up on C++ studies
i'm just thinking, "how do i parse that"
Oh IOS61
C++ studies
Oh, by the way,
I decided to pick back up
lol
what's that? i went to back up my hard drive
>_<
lol
oh no, where did my back up of my files go
i lost my only hard drive back up
IOS61 would you please back up
!rules
zc00gii: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
it's cause you're voiced
:D
If you go on record saying you use p2p, you can get $13?
can i get a voice
and opped (if i want)
lolwut
rosch: that's weird
rosch: no
	are a regula helper you may be promoted to have voice and should we
i am totally a regular helper
you may be
:D
I /try/ to be a regular helper. :P
I'll run it. What's the app now?
i regularly......enforce rules XD
it just shows unicode chars from 0x20 to some value
C++ sucks
let me upload it somewhere
do you have wiiload?
I do
I set it up just the other day
:D
Wow
it includes the .ttf file i guess
the .ttf file is 500kb
$16!

"It was Ubuntu ISOs. Really."
3million in lawyer fees
i'm trying to figure out
Okay
Lemme load up the HBC
"Your honor, comcast records clearly show this user was using p2p for porn"
in my last version of FML
bunch of french characters weren't supported
no no
like
wtf are you doing?
for this app?
yes
oh i just displayed a bunch of characters
that's all i wanted to see
if it would show up
it's just the chars from 0x20 to 0x1FF
no, what's the point of figuring all this out?
i'm still lost
like why the word wrapping?
oh, because i grab text from a website
and display it
need to wordwrap
there's no automatic wordwrapping whatsoever
oh
didn't you do fml?
www.wiibrew.org/FMyLife/
yes
just use the one from that
Okay
The text shows up
I see symbols
The alphabet
good good
And abunch of other letters that I don't care to learn about
:P
hmm...
well segoeui doesn't look like it has other language support
gonna try simsun
Okay
all this text makes me want to try something
text talk*
haah do somethign
make a program
(format nil "~a~aPRIVMSG #wiihelp :test" #\Return #\Newline) --> "

anyone ehre?
Hmmm
Doesn't work
yes.
13okay Alt|eXAKR
you cannot get games here.
ok
thank yu
Try again
you*
13sorry Alt|eXAKR \
13-\
Now
there are shop channel updaters that just update the shop channel and the required IOS
Hmmm
13doesn't work Alt|eXAKR
then you are still able to use HBC and the shop channel
I understand there are a few programs I can use to update shopping channel without the firmware -
yeah, that
and if you are on 4.x already, you also keep the sd menu
13okay eonity
13why are you nick cha=ging Alt|eXAKR
we don't deal with warez
13you did it again eonity
At one point it's mentioned that I should have a backup just in case I brick my console, but I don't have a clue where to even start with this kind of thing, or which of the updaters is recommended
/me 13uses dig
i think it just looks for the word
do a nand backup with BootMii
Is this script supposed to go into Remote or Users>
*?
14Remote lol
ehe
Are you able to install BootMii to boot2 with the hackmii installer?
13LLOTS!
/me 13hugs
as far as I know, I installed bootmii when I updated HBC a few months back
you can install it to boot2 and as IOS
they are both different things
as for using it to backup, I'd need to find instructions
OK
lol
i still recommend creating a nand backup with it, but don't ever try to restore it unless you have BootMii boot2
Fail
I think I'm on 4.2, I'm not sure
I... should go check
shup up IOS61!
back up
dang, I tried
Maybe it's the variables
I'll be back in a few secs
13Hey Quany
I'm on 4.2E
I don't see why the ship channel updaters would require the trucha bug/a patched IOS
just in case I explode something
1st thing you should do is checking if you can get BootMiit boot2, or if you have it already
OK try again
...
about doing the bakkup, start BootMii(there's an option in HBC for it) and navigate trough its menu to actually do the backkup
It stores the bakup on the SD?
it uses the reset, power and eject button for navigation, but you can use a GC controller as well if you have one
yes
cool
And yeah, I have GC controllers in abundance
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaail
Does the process take very long?
Do you know?
If BootMii doesn't show up when selecting it in HBC, you either don't have BootMii IOS installed, or the files are missing on sd card
in both cases, just reinstall it
10-20 minutes maxy
i last updated my wii with 3.2u is there anypoint in going with a newer firmwar?
13LOL
fail
just fail
if you used the official way to udate, then BootMii IOS was deleted, but you can always just reinstall it(when you are on 4.2 or lower)
BootMii boot2 would also have been deinstalled, but would also be posible to reinstall(and highly recommended)
once I've done that - is there a shop (and other) channel updater that you've personally used or like?
no, i'm not using the ship channel
ok
you can just try them
i dont wanna bother with it if its unnecessary
fair enough
rbr
with skipping the oddicial update, and the shop channel installers, we are perfectly within the rules of this channel
of course
or the rules on WiiBrew which are basically the same
I have that highlighted on my notes
softmodded
whats the point of chipping it?
......
10not that word
/me shot
as long you don't have any patched IOS installed, i would say it's difficult to brick the wii
playing burnt backups, gc games
i do both
..
if it's softmodded, then I'd use the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide...at the end you'll be on 4.1...which is the place to be
Someone else try it
10!exakr
but whats the point of going from 3.2 to 4.1 if no games require it?
I can't remember but I think the vars are messed up before it has been used once
...
K try again
oops sorry
not enough sleep apparently
this should probably be done somewhere else
maybe a #test
"warning: Using dop-shop makes permanent changes to NAND and should be used with caution"
motionplus
motion plus
ANYWAY
THIS DOESN'T WORK.
i was on 3.2 for the longest time
there ay go
ya*
with priiloader and all games working
cept havent played any wiimotion plus crap
it should only touch the shop channel and its IOS, which should be IOS61
not sure if i installed the preloader
gtg
preloader is outdated...it's now priiloader
4.1 has a bunch of updated ios files and seems to be more stable
D:
that april fools joke really pissed me off
been to long since ive used my wii
which is something i have heard of yet
i gotta find some goodgames
n't*
lol
http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSCU
still worst case: it just doesn't work
ooh, I think I looked at this one before

it's my dad's old SUV
12all the info is there
Mercury Mountaineer, from 2000
back when it first came out
like a month ago he bought a Cadillac for him
and gave my sister and me his SUV
either a 2006 saab 9-3 or a 2007 accord
lol
LOL Saab
I actually like Honda
just that the Mercury drives completely different
then last night I took my mom's Honda Odyssey minivan
and was like "Frick, how do I use this thing"
XD
XD
i'm used to a dodge
i tried driving my dad's Prius and
yeah ><
LOL
Never drove a Prius.
Toyota
but Honda, I liek their cars
Neither am I lol
It like...
lags
I've driven a Civic, those are pretty nice
when you hit the accelerator
heh
6Yay, it works.
check, check, 123
"flooring" it takes 5 seconds to go
LOL
Also wb
srsly
see, the thing with my mom's Honda
it accelerates just as fast as anything else
you just have to push harder on the petal
that p-ssed me off about American cars for a while
how they speed up superfast
but apparently some people like that?
I got used to it LOL
lol
I mean, I got used to it
but I learned to drive in a Honda
er Chrysler
w/e
lol
like as long as it has 4 wheels and the engine works it's fine with me
I used to be car-obsessed a long time ago, talking elementary school lol
heh
but yeah I just want something that works and doesn't look like poo
/me enters his dad's Prius in it :O
well neither did I XD
well it seems all too common
I blame it on Hot Weels
eh
LOL Hot Wheels
see
I played with LEGOs
not those./
I played with Hot Weels, LEGO and K'nex or whatever it's called
LOL K'nex
I tried those once
and went back tO LEGO
I liked K'nex more than LEGO xD idk
heh
hi shadows
well you can do some legit amazing things with LEGO
truely
like before I got the RCX even
and use a really long wire
LOL

got Android 2.2 running great on my Droid

amd then they all disappeared
that certainly blew up in nintendos face
shoudl have dropped the "gimmicks" and go for power liek psp and ps3
and sel more units
o wait
games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
they sold less
lke metoid prime hunters, and such
sony's problem is the price
Tarawa: You haven't played many DS games.
<Tarawa> games that force you to use the DS's touch sdcreen as a touch screen, imo, are crap
Well, now
the slider pad fixes that problem!
Hey
for the 3DS
no, its still no where near as accurate as a nipple stick
well, not for DS games, since they already have the flaw
talk about poor games
Gotta go for it!

I'd have to be a fanboy of Kid Icarus..

in theory?
i dont know about dvdx.....but the ios hbc uses has to be changed in addition....and then it would work, yeah
but it's not like anyone actually uses the shop channel anyway :P
I cried when I saw him say "Sorry to keep you waiting" at E3.
erm yeah, lots of people do
seriously?
why would they not?
i never have... all the old games on the shop channel are available through HBC emulators anyway
if you would kindly READ THE FREAKING RULES, youd know we dont support piracy and therefore dont support games through emulators
12o-o
Athenon, we support games through emulators
just to be irritating

MuzerNtbk: i have been told that the official ruling is we support emulators and that's all
it does seem vague, you're right...
hmm
MuzerNtbk: well, it's been common knowledge around here for months that the official rule is that we support emulators only
The way I thought of it is that using an emulator is far more likely to be legitimate than using backed-up Wii games or WiiWare
only legal roms are self-dumped ones...period ;P
Espeon
And I'm good.
x3
good to hear

LOL...since when do we go on the way things SHOULD be instead of the way things ARE?
bbl i guess....idk
Athenon, since the beginning AFAIK... I'm sure you could argue that the HBC and many other things we support are against the DMCA, or even its (more lenient) European equivalent

NOMP (NZB-O-MATIC PLUS)
it's a stripped down news client...do you not understand step 1 ?
is there a working inject of Star Wars Shadows of the Empire?
viince, where have you seen dmca's hitting NG's?
haven't seen, just heard
ne1
whoever
when it disappears from all servers...what other conclusion do you reach ?
Evening all
I*
idk, some peeps complained about it...
has anyone seen a wiiside configurator for cfg loader?
03XD
Idk if it was removed from ALL...or not
03so
03I upgraded my phone to Android 2.2
no jwash
03works pretty well, though surprisingly not that many apps support moving to the SD card yet :/
Nice
How slow does it run :p
Ji
Jk*
03same speed as 2.1/
<lbiza> incomp crap on ng
<jc23> dmca takedowns ?
03why would it be slower
03I just need to configure Autoruns again
03becuase I have like over 9000 things that run whenever I Make a call >_>
ng's have dmca compliance
and got everyone freaked out
viince...really
600mhz processors aren't as slow as they appear, I guess
read giganews dmca compliance
My own personal bottom line would be 1 ghz, but you've changed my mind
considering most news hosts keep servers outside of the US, where dmca's mean shit
03well
giganews != most
031GHz is only in like one phone
03AFAIK
03I can overclock mine to 900MHz
03I just don't
03because that wastes battery
03though meh
03the one thing that bugs me
No, it's on about 3 others now
giganews == biggest
03the "sound off" is now the same as "vibrate"
ftpii ?
03I like dthe ability to turn *everything* off
giganews == most expensive
03heh
03w/e
03I mean
032.2 isn't even out for real on the Droid
03I used my rooted access to install a custom ROM
giganews != cheapest
giganews > most
On my touch
03heh
03well I don't
03...
03sigh
could be
And for that I envy you
03"append SMS" doesn't actually append
03here's the thing
03I backed up my text messages before I upgraded
but that's still not the 1st time I've heard the complaint
03then when they got erased
03I left it alone
03LOL gaming hobies
03you could just start pirating
/me hides
How about NO
they can be compliant, but if they were truely acting on it, a lot more would be removed
not just SMG2
03fine, go broke
03if I could afford to buy everything I use, I would
I also want to get deeper into anime, but that would cost a fortune
Plus card games
it seems like other articles have been removed at times...not Just that...but not TONs either
03most anime isn't even sold in America
03like fansubs and the like
such as?
movies
cause things disappearing could be a bad hdd on the server
I realize that
or other things
As I was saying, I also want to start collecting another set of cards
lol they are disappearing off usenet servers cause they are taking them off
they would
especially when they advertise 99.9% completion
smb2 .. lots of hbo shows are taken off giganews
I'm sure it sucks by now
99%+ completion rate
that means..if they got DMCA's for tons of shit, and they hid it, they're completion rate would be a lot lower
hmm
Yugioh is cheap
their completion rate is still the same
whether they delete something or not
yes even cause of that
which means, their server isn't COMPLETE
there server is complete
cause that post doesnt exist on their servers
because it was deleted
As for gaming, I can control myself
I don't need any games right now
their servers are still complete
[SR], this is going nowhere
doesnt matter cause i'm right
semantics
http://www.newzgroups.com/_newsgroup-completion.asp
yah and all their parts are complete
if they remove a full 5gb post
that isn't complete
that has fuck all to do with being complete
complete means 100% of the fuckn thing
not 80
90
or 73
which means, their server isn't complete in their postings
ur an idiot
03btw, I found a thing that proves that the record labels do nothing but steal money from artists
actually that means their server is complete in their postings
exactly
how does giga not having it make them incomplete?
i guess sometimes logic is tough to instill in people
... Yeah I must by psyco since I'm talking to myself
Oh yeah
I have about 10 albums I want to purchase
must be

Bottom line, I need a job

BatistaLT: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
guess he felt defeated
I dont really weant to swap usenet prioviders if I dont have to
i read it somewhere
giga is over priced shit anyway
get newshosting
giga is way over priced
i share newshosting with my buddy .. was $100 for 2 years
newshosting is 14 a month
unlimited ips
they are, but I've been with them for years with no complaints
connections
and 600+ retention
they dont allow unlimited IPs anymore tho :(
I only have 1 IP =D
newshosting
ya they do
i got 9 ppl using this account
most do dual wan
is newshosting being targeted by the deletions?
years of giganews?
that sucks
ya man
get newshosting
and share the account with a friend
cable and dsl
do dual wan
i got 3 cables modems
lol
only 60gig cap on the cable here
ouch

got 700+ hours a month no worries
hehe
how fast is ur dsl
5Mbps
omg
id stab myself
wtf
i do
you cant get 1tb with 5mbit, can you?
Yah
it would take 700 hours
yep ..
lol
I dont see it advertised having multiple IPs on newshosting
tarawa it wont
lol they dont advertise it
just trust me
it works
newshosting and uns dont block it
hah
i use 3 every time i download
and i know atleast 5 others use this account 24/7
u gotta sue euro server
now that i never tried
and port 7000
or 8000
lol
pretty sure i use 9000
why cant you email them
ive called comcast and asked why the fuck my hacked modem doesnt work anymore

VideoStudio is quite awesome though
LOL
is pretty awesome
i use WMM
EW
i h8 it
then don't use it
but its all ive got
tbh I'd just go looking for some other program rather than take the risk, even if CVS is apparently good
and I have already had a crap experience with Corel and would rather not possibly go through it again. 8)
The last Corel product I used was Wordperfect 8 XD
LOL
I personally prefer Word 2000

I'm not even sure that's an accurate time. :P

hey and thank you RP4L
5My friend made an RP plot like that. The first sentence:
EXACTLY RP4L MEWTWO TURNED INTO WUSSIE POKEYMAN
Okies :o
I saw softmod guide 4.2, is that specific guide for Wii's Menu Ver. 4.2U?
heya Nick!
YOU NIXIONITE YOU
/me shot
Is it Amarokz?
you all made torch butt leave XD
EXACTLY RP4L THEREFORE ZOROARK
SHOULD
BE
4EEEVIIIIL!
thats because there must be a very veyr long epic battle
after 200 years
when EVIL RULES THE WORLD
and Nick is prime minister
5Why should Zoroark get that opportunity? It belongs to a legend.
4EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLL
it belongs to RP4L
wait me prime minister?
Yes
5YEAH IT BELONGS TO ME.

5D:
5That's horrible.

he'll eat you
5;;
but he's still epic
?softmod
? softmod
wait..drf is here
I did not either :o
loanshark, 4.2 is 4.2...
RP4L: do you remember the movie independence day?
I hate 4.2 to hack, such a bitch
haha
hmmz
Just beware of Amarokz guide, I was able to use it after figuring where he fucked up heh
thanks
hello
Hey
You're welcome
Wii is probably the most fun to hack, due to all these IOS's and shit.
wii is simple to softmod
14That movie was epic
v4.2 is kind of a bitch, PSP is easiest. Xbox 1 was the hardest and most nerve racking I've done (using Hotswap method)
NS reviewed it finally reviewed it XD
*NC
yea
hotswap isa bitch
Hotswap is manly as fuck
4.2 isn't any harder than 4.1
lol
on i have done that
oh*
i just cheat now
i made the adapter and dedicated a 256mb thumb stick to it
I had to unlock the HDD by playing music and pausing
yea thats was always the easiet way via hotswap
:o
/me still has 3 xb1's
all runnin xbmc
laptoparisteooo
i could never found xbmc
hehe
i have there site
thou its like from 02
and they have 3 2010 builds lol
I heard they stopped working on it recently
i could never get my 500g to work
hey Stitch I gtg for a bit bbl
like 30mins
aww
T3CH XBMC 2010-07-08 SVN rev30442
and unless it locks
It'd be nice if Wii also had a homebrew entertainment system as polished as XBMC was
u cant lol
wiimc is good
yea well wiimc is getting there
wiimc ftw
if you want media, get a wdtv
haha
dual layer dvds cost me fricken $2.50 a pop
or spend 20$ on a xb1 :)
wdtv for the win
o.o
nethier can xb1 hah
bad wireless support though
yea
there wifi is poooop
lol
how would i do evilone
Too bad it's in 4:3
how would i do? huh
gooooder english
xbox1 can output 480p/720p/1080i
not many games that support abouve 480p tho
yea
8.5gb disc
lot of homebrew can tho
but xmbc wont play mkv
itll do mp4
itll studder but itll do it
xbmc does play mkv.. its just unwatchable
how would i install my 500g in my xb1
yea
its like 4 fps
:)
ramo: u got the eeprom?
ramo34 when you get above 250gb, make sure you split it and use F+G drives
i have a tool that makes xb hdd's
lol
splits em up and everything :)
xbhdm :)
it splits f at 113gb
I need a program to split my SD card in half into WBFS
14:3
o.o
fat32 > * for wii
My friend bought a 1TB hdd and made it completely WBFS lol
yea
thats stupid
Wii is fine with Fat32?
i wouldnt even do that
yea
of course
wii does fat32/ntfs
Nice.

thou ntfs is a bitch
ntfs is read only

i hear it messes up graphics, though
12I know
I hope they dont make RA4 though >.>
Lugia365: I wouldn't put too much stock in that.
the RA series is sad and pathetic
12I know
and extremely racist and sexist in the 3rd instalment
XD
RA one had some sense in that
LOL
Meh no cheats

CoM is easy
04...
/me > Ninja's
04just rub it in my face why don't you
But maybe that's because I leveled up too much
/me shot
04yeah well, I have no patience
I leveled all my characters up to level 99
yeah well
I have even less patience than you
03Sigh
03I got a BSOD
Oh
:3
/me trips.
WHAT'S THE PLAN YO
lol-.-
:o
/me catches Stitch
/me catches
Try using Dop-Mii to uninstall
wait
it shows as uninstalled
lol
do i have to reinstall them both
/me fails
stryker*
1.0 and 1.1
well i'm doing that now
/me stands Stryker upright
Sorry..... at least Proto was there
My girlfriend failed me! D:
/me cries.
I'm soooooooo sorry
7...
Did you remove both 1.0 and 1.1 with DOP-Mii? Oh wait, I'm sure you did
hai kaioo
03http://failblog.org/2010/07/14/epic-fail-photos-review-win/ <-- LOL at those comments
7I've been spending too much time on TV Tropes/
i'll try it now
i'm reinstalling them
with dop-mii
/me nuzzles and kisses Stryker's cheek
then i'll reboot
Actually
and uninstall
7I thought that meant the trope Heroic BSoD. O_o
/me cries and cuddles.
03No
Remove 1.0 with Dop-Mii first
Aristeo's a girl now?
03it means an actual BSoD.
/me nods
And then remove 1.1 through the System Menu
:o
Whenever Stryker and I are in the same sentence, yes
Yup
<3
/me offers Stryker a kitten
Don't eat
/me ea- cuddles it.
ok gonna try that
D:
arghh what's wrong with my sd card now
:o
Apparently I'm not the only with things having to break down on them
RAGE
D:
PETA would probably kill you
lol
I feel like playing CoM now
I still want that puppy though :P
but I can't
Here, I'll try it myself
Just to make sure it works
kk erasing photo channel 1.1 now
:P
Oh nvm
:P
... why do i only have 1600 blocks free
versus the 2100 on my gf's wii
:3
...lolwtf?
Why are you deleting all of the System Channels?
i only want disc channel + hbc + mii
i don't use anything else
also, I hate peta
they're crazy
there was a good line in the penn and teller show bs, about peta
oh wow line rider 2 takes 128 blocks
:O No Shop Channel?
i make things
elebits is 109 blocks
man.. how do these people program their saves
"...welcome to slavery." "No thanks, I've already had a wife."
lawl
:( I haven't made progress
It was too confusing to even get some code together
watcha mean
printfs
And other functions that I have to bring in
can someone help me find a pattern like whats used in the banner for the check mii out channel?
lol yes
I know how to make a simple one in C++
:P
printf is easy to pick up
It seems to be the same as cout
similar
cout would be like
cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
in printf it'd be
printf("Hello, %s!", name);
%s is like a placeholder for string
printf is dumb
lol I went ahead and deleted my Photo Channel
well go write a sample thing in C++
and then you'll have a direct comparison
do....object oriented programming!
/me was tab failed.
oh wait....... ;(
yes
No.
That's why I fell out of it.
I hated it.
All right, lemme go to pastie
let's see
/me puts some sugar on it!

LOL
LOL
lol not bad?
:P
y007ghg7, rip the check mii out channel apart and get the open.br file
......
I bet it's horrible
Hahahah
XDDD
lol it's really simple
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpf1CiRuxxw
I know
:P
and i think banner.br also
^ fail
now make something more complicated
lol
i just need a pattern like thats used in the background of the banner
o.O
the blue/orande squares\
XD.
orange*
std?
that's rather disturbing
2meh?
std::cout
and can just shortcut to cout
2...hello?
hello?
hahahah
something else
2Hi!
using namespace blah blah
using cout << on it's own won't work anymore
since it'll be like
wtf is cout
it's similar to java packages
/me winces.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRHCCrSSdk
/me bleeds.
oh ok
D:
/me casts Heal on Stryker
yes and no
similar but not exactly
o.o
14wtf
you have to go
12huh
03LOL wut
2uh...hi?
yeah, cuz java packages are like includes.....you dont have just 1 and it can just find whatever youre looking for
how did THat happen? Dx
All right, I'm working with something here.
XD
idk she always does pop videos
/me 2is eating marshmellows
i'm trying to find somewwhere to buy
a USA version of pop'n music
never heard of it
get the channel and rip it apart
rosch, you from the us?
?
then edit the banner file
but of course that was last year when using as many effects as you could was all the rage too :P
ahh
Thanks XD
12WTF!?!?
I got notice'd too
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop%27n_Music <-- there's a japenese and an EU release
2thankyou
but no USA
12what was that?
lol I remember all my haters "u need 2 add mor effects!!!!!"
12i have a feeling this isn't over
has a 4 letter word
12lolwow
/me 2is going to her first anime convention
starts with t
12who was that!?
use nus downlaoder to get the files
dont patch as wad
pack*
xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK9pi-XsV0M
12idk?
even though you kicked him from the channel, you didn't kick him from the server -v-
12I noticed when my mIRC was freking out
He was just on #rp
12oh
12i don't have the authority to kick him from the server
14None of us do :\
/me 2dances
12lol
12arti needs to promote more Opers
12ya I'll say
hahahahah
with all the tons of effects and people were all saying "OMG IT'S AMAZING"
14Glacymr: We'll have to speak to her about that
Haha
12brb
even though she was subbed to me a long time before that then unsubbed because I wasn't effecty
12indeed
/me 2likes eating marshmellows and dancing to Nightcore
03yeah, I've poked her about it plenty times XD
12she probably won't listen then
14drf: we'll all have to mention it then
12whe all 3 aren't active enough
it seems like the goal of a lot of videos I see are to cram in as many effects as possible
12*when
a lot less people are like that this year but last year that's all it was haha
12vback
12back*
one of my friends does amaaaazing videos, she's like a little effecty but a little not
Maybe I'm just watching the old ones lol
and does amazing lipsync/dance videos
:D
And everything worked as intended
i do that more and more xP
/me puts bandaids on Stryker
I don't really search for them
often i have a couple syntax errors and everything else works fine
lol
I just click on the ones that come up under related on yours
curly :O
It died.
hahah
:<
Hey Curly
alright, osx is booting now
without a boot cd
:)
hi curly :)
I try to do the 1st step from tutorial Softmod 4.2, and I got the messenge on the screen saying that "The device inserted in the SD Card Slot cannot be used" when I inserted 1GB micro SD into it with appropriate files.
/me is a corpse now and cannot respond.
but.. bandaids D:
But blood loss. :O
fine then D:
formatted to fat32?
ducttape!
I did formated on both fat16 and fat32, but it won't work.
/me puts his blood in the Strykahling.
Fixed!
/me mends the wounds with duct tape!
I'm wondering if my 1GB microSD compatible to Wii or not.
If there are some.
12how did he do that anyway? looks like a complicated code of some sort
:O
duct tape always helps :)
lol
*choice
And I made it loop infinitely
It doesn't look at all complex.
:3
lol
12ist was a script...
12so it would be complex to me lol
Simple FOR/NEXT loop.
Aw, that's cute
12I heard 3 "dings" on my computer every time he posted that message lol
yeah my friend drew it then she gave it to me to recolor
12...
Repeat script ad nauseam (or ad ban.)
If I was narcissistic or whatever, the Strykah would now find me attractive \o/
12you melted my brain XD
lol
x)
Since I carry my mind in my bloodcells.
/me regenerates his blood.
Does that mean I hate the Andres now?
12Oh
12thanks
12was it a script, or the flood thing used on mIRC?
12and you have a color made at random
12I see
just kidding xP
Remember the loop. As it decreases code length.
12Right
Why? o.o
12so it was a script
Oh, right.
A script triggered multiple times.
12lolwow
12sounds like he uses mIRC... I think
Fair trade.
Most standalone clients support scripts.
Doesn't matter if mIRC is used or not.
12oh
I have scripts in my X-Chat. :P
12cool
12I'm just guessing that mIRC is one of the best then since I hear about it a lot
12hang on
It's the most prolific, which isn't necessarily the best.
12oh
o.o
wb Stitch
Stryker
/me was tab failed.
lolwut
I have a menu for my scripts. How you do it in mIRC... ask a mIRC user.
12right
12on mIRC it's in the options > IRC > flood
use a real sd card kthx
I might need some coffee...
I should probably be awake by now.
i might need my emergency fruit roll-ups
But since I have not actually gone to sleep, then I shall shrug.

12Finally!
And I don't really like any of the characters
He's not here right now

It makes characters boring when they're like that
it's all different depending on how you take books

/me finds books boring to
........ a really nice pillow though
I read one every now and then though

He'll be able to have a very nice, relaxing, and comfortable sleep
helps me sound somewhat intelligent
lol how shweet
But comfortable
i listen to them on my mp3 player
Well of course
unless it copies an idea word for word it usually doesn't bother me
which is fine with me
as long as the characters are likable
which they're not

nice
really is a good homebrew app for the wii
lol
and my desktop wont get past the compaq splash screen with it plugged in
<~Armageddon> I don't try to feel up kids/people (except for my little bro)
I'll wait to post the link until somebody says to go ahead. Site is wiihacks.com
right.
hmm.
may I show you this tutorial?
wii sucks for media...which is why I got a wdtv
if you want
http://www.wiihacks.com/general-homebrew-hack-issues/61574-4-3-fix.html
all consoles do
360 ps3 is too restrictive too
"4.3 Fix
Requires cIOS to be installed"
yep, all consoles do, i got a mac mini only for xbmc
ofc those also do hd
but thats it
even though it's huge
still clunky
converting and media streamers
hate having to stream
besides no proper indexing etc
nothing beats a dediatced medi device
ia
xbmc ftw, nothing comes close
dependign on how much u wanna spend
i still run xbox1 in all the bedrooms running and booting too xbmc
alongside the ps3/360/wii (depending on the bedrooms)
i need a modchip for my 3 xboxes
softmod them y007ghg7
basically, the Wii is quite complicated internally - there are two processors!
www.smdepot.net
very easy
and no hdmi
wdtv ftw
two processors for two different tasks?
it doesnt do HD at all |MB|
i got 3 xboxes from my friend
acer evo + xbmc > wdtv
well i thought it coudl play some 1080i/720 xvid content
wdtv/pch > *
wulfgar wrong
very strange
if u wanna stay cheap wdtv is where its at
you spend roughly the same on acer revo then wdtv
havent' seen wdtv with cfw?
latest mac mini + xbmc > acer evo + xbmc > wdtv > nmt (popcorn hour first models)
exactly :)
if u want eevry bell and whistle and nice customizations u would want xbmc htpc
is there a wiki or something about this?
dasefx - they have xbmc on mac mini runnning now ?
yeh
dasefx, if you are talking price, yes
lmao
nice
althoguh would be such a waste of mac mini
way too expensive
the only time when an IOS is updated is in a security update (stopping homebrew)
nah i write some apps for the iphone when i'm not playing or watching tv. all in my living room :)
migth as well build a proper htpc
interesting
haha i'm sounding like a mac fanboy, i'm notttttt
cIOS is basically a hacked IOS with extra features and some security removed installed in one of the high-up slots (I can't remember which is used nowadays)
the wiki to find out about all this is wiibrew.org
okay
is the HBC/wiibrew scene against cIOS?
i have a dune prime myself, but maybe on hindsight u shoudl have gotten somethign else
i*
mostly, as its main use is piracy
WADs are also strictly forbidden, right?
well again, mostly, because it is mainly for piracy
only WADs of pirated content are
but if you have a good reason for using one or the other, they are fine
system titles are fine
!wb NUSD
NUSD: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUSD
^ is one such good example of a proper use for them
hmm, okay
it doesn't say. there are 17 different WADs though lol
anything that makes you install that much crap might not be worth the time or effort
would I need a cIOS to watch DVDs? (one of the things I hope to do eventually)
lol, alright
no actually you don't
you just need DVDX
hmm
it enables the DVD Playback features in IOS
the problem is with DVDs is that some newer Wiis block it in hardware
well, not strictly speaking hardware
yep :(
Unfortunately I was a tardbasket and updated to 4.3 lol
drive firmware
DVD drive firmware more like
dasefx, dont hide it
u r one
but you can't change that from software as far as we know
I purchased my wii...two years ago?
that should be fine then
do you have a bootmii nand backup you can restore to?
lol
eesh yeah
don't worry though one is in the works
:
)
:)
I checked here a few weeks ago
dhewg needs to htfu
>_<
oh they do
yep
lol, exactly
MuzerNtbk, I can't remember when I bought it because I haven't used it that much, but I should be fine there I think
yeah, hopefully
I have brawl, but I haven't even played it
hesperaux: having an older wii you could probably use formatter
its a tool you run from bootmii totally formats the nand and starts over
I have the US version of brawl
Galaxy|, not without bootmii he can't :P
good idea to use bootmii to make a nand backup first
henkpoley, good
i know
lol
IOS61: you should really check the context of the sentence
lukegb needs to update it
haha
he told me he would ages ago
nand backup
lame
Very sensitive around here =|
lol
with good reason hesperaux
yeah
removing all doubt would only make it worse for us
lol
Galaxy|, I understand
we are no different to them than pirates
apparently
they hold us in no esteem
we are the enemy
ragetastic
they've made that perfectly clear
4.3's update made that abundantly clear
and yet you updated why?
> _ <
i actually read the update text when I installed it. i think i was probably smoking something
yeah that was retarded of me
i wanted the shop channel is all
that seems to be the common thread
=/
people take the hit for the shop to work
very devious of them
all you have to do is install 2 wads for the system titles
and you're set
i heard about that later lol
the latest shop and its ios
i had homebrew in mind when i bought the wii
certain 1337 tools need it
the average user however won't need fakesign capabilities
when i updated, I thought the only thing around was the HBC. I didn't even guess that there would be a modded Shop
there isn't a modded shop
homebrew is _very_ riskless on the Wii when you go the Twiizers way
Galaxy|, if I get into this, I'll probably try to do anything and everything I can. I like to hack around with my toys
MuzerNtbk, at the time I didn't have that impression, unfortunately
I hope they do
nothing public
hesperaux: you could take a drastic cut and use formatter to wipe the nand start over
it's possible to run wiibrew through brawl right?
no, of course not. But you can do anything you want from bootmii.
i mean bootmii
yes
hesperaux, yeah, you can install it through brawl
install it or run it?
both
hesperaux, you can run *homebrew* right now through brawl
;o
i knew i could run homebrew
just not install anything
yeah
i didn't know i could *install* bootmii
not now
but later
bootmii is what...a chainloader?
you can install bootmii as boot2
the system menu can't check and remove that
bootmii is a replacement bootloader
Galaxy|, but not right now
hmm
yep
basically, bootmii shoves IOS out of the way
its getting more and more ios like as time passes
you can if you want to
Galaxy|, yeah, but without the security
the only risk for that is shop certs or something to that effect
or the limitations
crediar is learning how to emulate ES
he's got it down pretty well
it doesn't have the required software on the client end to do PXE
not AFAIK
the network is tough on the Wii
needs firmware
ok
which needs a filesystem
its on its way though
I might be able to boot off NFS though once a kernel is loaded, right?
that should be reasonable yeah
hesperaux, If you have an initrd with all the firmware in
I don't see why not
how much internal ROM does the wii have?
yeah
tasty...
that is implemented
lol
I could probably figure it out
ok
i'd need to keep the drive in the same port then I assume (all the time)
no
as long as you don't have two drives
okay
if you have two, it'll be pretty random which order they are detected in
lol
although I think it's improved with bootmii
you can't run/install bootmii as it stands, it needs an exploit
okay
but an exploit is guaranteed to come at the same time as the HBC exploit :P
=)
hi
haha
HackMii Installer v0.7
yeah
it is a great word
rage
lol
yeah
why do you say that?
because it is
they'd need to reissue patched disks
is it any fun to play it by yourself? heh...
this was an easter egg in the first Twilight Hack that actively worked around Nintendo's fixes:
http://hackmii.com/2008/06/twilight-hack-v01beta1/#comment-1610
usually good for rebuilding motivation
lol
*:P
that's great
homebrew comes back and we make a neat hack
lol
yeah i noticed
if comex really wanted to I am sure he could revive BannerBoMB
but he's too busy off in iPhone lala land
aww :( iphoney fail...
/me likes android =)
just stay away from the Droid-X and its self destructing boot loader :(
hehe
as a matter of fact, i'm staying away from verizon entirely as soon as I can
thinking of buying a used G1, putting the latest android on it, and tasting the beef
yeah =/
that blew my mind to read that
hi
someone should port android to the Wii
that'd be amazing
;o
OMG
too bad I didn't stay a CS student
lol
easier than porting to Broadway
Galaxy|, yeah, now I'm electrical eng.
arm ;o
720?MHz PowerPC
iirc
android could be ported to that
yeah
that is really weird
729MHz PowerPC
you'd need to make a "reverse IOS"
for screen access
lol

Wii Hardware: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wii_Hardware
/me clicks
lol
does the Wii have any headers/pinouts for JTAG or similar?
hmm
it has GPIO pins
like LCD screens
neat
how are you
that'd be pretty neat to see Android ported to it
http://marcansoft.com/uploads/images/starlet_says_hi_2.jpg
the graphics portion would be a pain though
dude, i want to do that
i need to get over my fears of hurting my little wii
Android on the Wii would be amazing
that was a Bootmii experiment
hey you guys :D
!rules
mzaouar_: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'

if you can figure out the mysteries of getting the hardware to work properly in *nix
i just googled GPIO wii, but it brought up wiikey. I do believe that's not allowed, right?
lol
guys can someone help me with installing neogamme permanently on the wii, not launch it from the sd card everytime? (im on 4.1 with hbc )
i've never done hardware programming, or even advanced software programming for that matter
mzaouar_ !rules
dunno why that came up for GPIO
hesperaux, http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/Hollywood_GPIOs
i've done some assembly language though, but have never actually used it on a piece of hardware
Galaxy|, he has
lol
i'll be starting with PIC assembly once I get my bench set up again (just moved a bit ago)
dono
mzaouar_, that's usually a lot harder
!rules
mzaouar_: You are now being sent the rules. Please check for a tab/window/button labelled 'IOS61'
but running from the Wii itself is usually discouraged - risky and sometimes illegal
hesperaux: more power to you
the Wii development has been a bit stagnant lately
hesperaux, hmm, they don't actually tell you where the debug GPIOs actually are
http://wiire.org/Wii/console/motherboard
ok ok cool
hesperaux: that can easily be done via software lol
Galaxy|, they don't seem to mention GPIO there
i wish I had two wiis
its only changed slightly since 2007
MuzerNtbk how about putting it in internal storage ?
mzaouar_, internal storage IS NAND
mzaouar_, a way of installing channels or other Wii software. We don't usually discuss them here unless there is a good reason to, as they are often used for piracy.
LOL
Galaxy|, oh i already have dd-wrt on it
it fucking prints money lol
Galaxy|, i'm talking about using the JTAG and serial pinouts found on most linksys (mine included) to control external devices via wifi
Galaxy|, that sucks a lot..
my router I think has a serial debug port
you can probably unbrick it with a JTAG
don' think it has much else
lol
Galaxy|, strange
dodgy hardware?
and I'm using it as a repeater with DD-WRT
<3 dd-wrt
i set up a repeater for my g/f
I'm connected via it now, it's great!#
though oddly enough DD-WRT on my device has a very weird problem
I might take my older WRT54G and make it into a Kismet Drone
half the pages of the web UI simply won't load
none of them are pages that I need, luckily
but it's rather odd
browser script blocking?
MuzerNtbk, i've experienced that before
check this out: http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2010/our-door-opener-science-project/
that's the kinda router I have
hesperaux, perhaps because I was too lazy to reset it :P
lol
believe me it does affect things
the nvram is a pita
sometimes it wont clear until 2-3 passes of that reset technique
30-30-30 is a reset then?
30 seconds holding reset 30 seconds holding without power 30 seconds holding with power
I'll have to give it a try
forces a clear of the NVRAM
it seems to work fine as it is other than that problem now
you might see the router go through reset more than once. this is normal
should just build in a switch for that lol
instead of holding the button just flip a switch and wait 90 seconds
yeah
itd be a lot easier
that button is a pain to get at from the outside
but you need to unplug power too
yep
I don't like the DD-WRT homepage though
i usually use a pen
out-of-date crap :P
some of it is
it said my router wasn't compatible, and I got worried
there are conflicting messages on the site
but after googling, I found that it was
the buffalo router?
yeah
wouldn't it be easier anyway to just telnet in and do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nvram
rather than a 30-30-30
yes
you can do that too
i don't know if that's the method, but you can use tenet
telnet*
telnet or ssh
telnet is on by default iirc
telnet
ssh works too
yeah
how do I enable ssh then?
system administration or something like that
in the services tab
>_> yes
iirc something like the shop certs are needed to use WiiConnect24
but their EULA says they can
yep
meh its 5 am i need sleep lol

yeah I woke up at 4am today =/

/me hides
wbfs have low prefrance than iso i mean iso loads faster
no
am i right i dont know if i am
juse pick one and use it :)
a .wbfs file is an iso with padding and update removed
ok
just one more thing
how can i burn a doul lyer dvd
just like a normal dvd ?
i am just asking
yea, you can burn a dual layer dvd with imgburn
if there is a layer break, make sure you specify it, or open the .dvd file
14.
ive never had much luck with dl dvd's and the wii....sometimes they work, sometimes not
/me dies
she is stupid she cant plug the use in hdd
damn do i have to say this
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGame
i cant give her my hdd
you just lost it
/me hides
most dual layer games have a specific layer break
when i want to burn a dvd i open the iso with imbburn then just click burn
usually a dual layer iso comes with a .iso, and a .dvd file
the .dvd file specifies the layer break
Animals, most 360 games come with a .dvd...not all wii games do
iso dont ?
^Wulfgar^: yea, the only one ive downloaded is ssbb, and it had a .dvd
but if there is no layer break, then great
oh i dont have the dvd file
nah, just burn the iso then, wulfgar said there isnt always a layer break
yea dunno about that one...if there wasnt a .dvd, then just burn the .iso i guess
should work
the size is nearly 7gb
yea, you need a dual layer dvd to burn it
thnx animals and wulfgar :D
sure

Hey, I thought about using WiiScu to update (mainly) my ShopChannel
Do I need to select anything else than just update Shop Channel? (for example IOS61?)
Or should I maybe just update everything

10Hi Quil
hi
http://kotaku.com/5587640/okamis-ds-sibling-goes-overboard-with-its-collectors-edition

k, i'd have to reformat it then i guess :)

it was weird
MuzerNtbk: it's been a few years, mind helping me up with gentoo?

all i remember is something about 3 of yall
the documentation is easy
lol
forgive my apparent ignorance, but, despite years in the emulation scene, I never actually modded a console
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml
heh
i tried gentoo once, but it failed miserably
(you can't really count DreamCast)
emulation != console
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-amd64.xml
proto myself and andres
figured something out and i dont remember the rest :o
lol x)
anyway, thank you for the information today
mine has been compiling KDE for the past few hours, anyway :P

lol
read & follow; that i can do :)
I don't use compiz really
We're not all bad :<
what's tiling?
I use KDE because KDE apps > other apps
in the context of window managers
the end.

MuzerNtbk: yes

Ex0du5, type ? softmod and follow the appropriate guide
that's all you got jinx, is shit
ohh
Thank you
? softmod
Should I update before modding? Ive heard mixed opinions on that..
dunedude: ?
NO
I have no filemanager except for a terminal =P
it controls taskbar (panel), desktop, and start menu (launcher, or whatever they're calling it nowadays). That's all.
get yourself to 4.1 and stay there, use safe updaters
oh
why does it need to die?
tpw_rules: stacking is awesome
jwash, the 3.1-4.1 softmod guide does that
Safe updaters?
MuzerNtbk: yes, and it sucks and is annoying
tpw_rules, buggy, crashy, bloated piece of shit
Oh ok, thanks
Ex0du5, just FOLLOW THE GUIDE
zc00gii, no, it's good.
is it like nautilus except crashier?
I like JUST a terminal
/me sighs.
zc00gii, do you have an 800x600 monitor?
it looks fine for me even when I'm using my second monitor at 1024x768
oh
why? :o
i really don't know what's wrong with just having a civil conversation
Just don't
/me <3 awesome
nothing
mkay
zc00gii, well get multiple fucking monitors then
just don't be surprised, this is IRC
where is a boy?
MuzerNtbk: I have no money :(
or multiple regular monitors if you can't afford the fucking variety
lol
which boy? lol
lol
sure, I bet you could find a 1024x768 LCD for practically nothing
where
lol
also, Gentoo is awesome because of this quote:
LO_KEY: thank you for that advice :)

MuzerNtbk: i got one for $10 at a yardsale :D

/me can't come up with a good analogy
Never seen either of them

Yes
hmm impressive
>|
lol
file -s /dev/sdc1
only way to settle it
lol
I even spelled like crap to get it in intime
atleast the site address is easy to remember
/me steals the mailtruck with them
/me drops them off today
it's always been the same domain name, just the top-level-domain changed in fact :P
I ordered the CPU from tigerdirect cause they had it as a OEM version
nice
no...
it used to be articuno.co.uk and lugia.co.uk
yeah
both would redirect to the same site tho ?
/me pant pant
lol
yes
My friend got a Q6600(?) for $1
lol
2(drf|away2): co.uk is the tld
2(drf|work2): co.uk is the tld
i'll cook in a min maybe
he got it working, ordered a 550W psu the other day
1,000 post where?
lol
but no it hasn't always been the same domain name
because it was never .us
until a couple years ago
/me facepalms
h4x0r3d the script to fix it
anyway
yes, yes i am.
no
D:
bbl, rebooting and modifying partitions
o_O
lol yes
for a while we didn't even HAVE the .co.uk due to LegacyLugia :P
/me eats people they are tasty :3
that person was stupid D:
nor have i heard of it
o.O
/me sees the word eat :o
.uk is the tld
.co is not part
nonsense
.co.uk is the tld - you get both in combination
TimeShift	it's always been the same domain name, <-- orly
i havnt had my daily dose of fruit roll-ups yet
o_o
that's all :<
eh
if you wanna get technical
lugia.us versus lugia.co.uk
I had some of myself
>_<
I consider lugia.us and lugia.co.uk two different domain names
o_O
as I said - only the tld changed
6lugia.co.uk is the site I originally joined at
you had some of yourself
6I was never active though
otherwise why would I have had to pay for 3 domain names when I got drfsupercenter.info, drfsupercenter.com and drfsupercenter.net?
lol
/me stares at that sentence
if they're the same domain name?
interesting
most people look at domain names as the entire URL, not just the part before the period
yea that could be taken wrong in some ways
because they're three different tld?
you're paying the the tld
you don't pay for a TLD though
heh
lol uh huh
wtf
See, I only thought about you biting yourself
<.< >.>
yea
<___< heh
I meant like my body consuming itself cause I have not eaten :P
well aren't you one to get technical on me
err i'll be back when the domain arguement is over :P
XD

/me likes 4
6with a good few thousand members, we're a rather popular site lol
grr
stupid gparted
anyway, whether we're talking domain names or TLDs
it was never originally lugia.co.uk
it was always articuno.co.uk back when I joined
LMAO
I remember being mad when the name changed
there was probably a reason for that check :P
can't you do a way back machine search on all this
http://www.lugia.us/site-history.htm
try it
to make it explicit, the second-level domain was always (if we ignore drf) "lugia", and only the top level domain has changed
nah, it was a faulty check
soo uhh
lol
it's partitioned wrong
right now it's only /dev/sdc, no sdc1
well, the third level has been dropped, but I don't know if most people would actually count www.
i got threatened to be stabbed by a bent fork

TrialPay does not steal data
nor does Netflix
I'm not some paranoid
kurolink, yeah, that'll work but my sisters are fricking idiots
i got a free movie ticket from trialpay it was cool
http://pastebin.com/dpKUfNS7
lukegb: emacs
but yeah
I just did M-x psychoanalyze pinhead
and that's the session I had with it =P
"Oh, that?"
...and they registered which movie you visited and possibly even which snacks and which size and flavour you picked
well
7 is XP as Vista is to ME
I have no problem with XP'
I'm using it right now
but for computers that can run 7
then it's ncie
plenty of data worth ten times more than the value of the ticket :)
ME was a huge fail
TimeShift, why do you assume every company is out to get you?
can you keep going for the same trial drf ?
or does trialpay track it some how ?
oooh
no
that might be why it didn't boot
I never even use it
I just sign up and cancel
I don't have syslinux installed
then you're screwed
pacman away!
drf - not a single company has money to give out for free
especially NOT in america :)
the way TrialPay works
2. you buy something, they get part of the revenue
and in turn they give you something free
I just abuse it when they let you use free trials of services
yeah =D
why sell if you can use the data yourself for market studies?
lukegb: you use arch
?
they don't spam me...
why spam you?
I make up a name and address
and use a temporary email'
that I delete once I'm done
look up my IP right now
*see
it won't be my name ;)
I doubt you're sitting in detroit by now :)
07because they totally check every single person for any sign of suspicion
yeah :P
no I'm not in Detroit
and yeah, that
they really don't care
just not atm, because I need MSVC#
oh do they?
07well
6I think TimeShift is rather paranoid
TrialPay is actually an acredited company
BECAUSE SHARPDEVELOP ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH <_<
it's not like www.thissiteisnotascam.com
/me runs
/me runs
if you ever succeed reaching my age, we'll maybe continue talking about it, k?
6...
are you saying I'm gonna die in the next 10 years?
did I say that?
now, who's paranoid here, eh? ;)
6what else COULD you mean by that?
Or, he could be saying you'll age faster than the normal population and manage to catch him up
07he's implying that because he's older he can assume he knows everything about a company he hasn't even used =P
yes because you totally live in America
just because you hate our country doesn't mean you know everything
Not all businesses are evil
07more like assumed stereotypes about american companies
07lol drf
you have no idea how much
07bad example
07because they do
LOL
6lol
do they?
07DUUUUUUUUUH
software
there's a huge list somewhere
and PLENTY of other factors
does that mean you're gonna boycott searching?
? list
for that matter
iTunes does the same thing
more proof that Apple is evil :)
LOLtiming
well, partly
14LOL
not anymore
besides receipts
14Epicness music right there
07the only personal info that matters is for things like passwords
? releases
!releases
6that's common sense >_>
!openingwii
I still don't see how this has anything to do with how credible TrialPay is
6lol I was just thinking that
LOL
Advertisements, pssh
I don't use Yahoo :)
real pros use an ad blocker
I do, but that's not the point
it has unlimited storage, for one
unlike gmail
you mean
"unlimited"
...which I also don't used
I mean, I have one throguh my ISP as well'
/me 6runs
!news
LOL Airwolve
AFAIK
but I have like 4000 emails
and it's not a problem
I have my own mail server and my IBM inbox for the rest?
LOL
I'm far too lazy for that
how about this, you email ME a bunch of partial rars
:P
also gmail allow 25 MB, and the 7GB I have is more than enough
why should I?
Did I say you, TimeShift?
grrr
The thing I don't like about gmail
is they try to be MS Outlook in a web browser
zu-zuXtimeshift here
I actually like just plain simple looking webmail
and gmail isn't simple?
6I use gmail, it's simple to me, but meh
it looks like Outlook, doesn't it?
it's certainly no more like MS Outlook than any other email client
6yeah
and hi
hi timeshift
orly Airwolve
/me hugs timeshift
It's in mtools
/me hugs back
http://imgur.com/bOZ47.png
yes that TOTALLY looks like Outlook, don't you agree?
/me hides
the *new* Yahoo mail does, I hate that
looks as much like it as gmail does, yes.
6he's done it for everyone else
I'm amazed I haven't banned her yet :)

/me 2flails in the bukkit
lol
Because
when you click on an email
it opens below the list,r ight?

I haven't really liked gmail's GUI
/me 2flails more in the bukkit

I'm not using a live cd -___-
or that
lol
^
but why?
the blundertails were easy for me
i just used fury

you can resize partitons in a booted system
just unmount them
http://gparted.sourceforge.net/liveusb.php
!espeon
lol
The fury cinematics are way to long, but there still cool.
walmart lets you return ANY damn thing
in ANY condition
yea figured that much
can we return crazy used girls?
its about 3 months old. got dropped today
you can still get store credit
and get beer and shotguns
yea thats the main thing, store credit would be fine. then i'll just grab another one
yea theyll do that
theyll do that a year later
MuzerNtbk: I'm resizing /

14No nothing like that, I misplaced my footing
02They might just be sore from that then
02Put heat on it
14Well the main fact that it stupidly hurts when I move my shoulder
14Even if it isn't a torn muscle, the chances of it being dislocated are high :<
o_O
dunno
!fapget

14Shiny-Growlithe: I did fall quite some distance before I stopped myself
hi stitch

Grass weakness :/

12grass weakness
12might actually make things more interesting XD
12since i play masquarine
Ha ha ha
121 energy pretty much says "i do 100 to feraligar and i get to draw 2 cards"
12then you do 20 less to me
Maybe I could make a second deck there for my speedrill strategy.
12i dunno
12literally
I know
12btw
It has a month to live
After that, my deck is scrap
12martini, i loved that deck
12Theguesst

12XD
12he beat me on time
0_0 well good for him
12i know i hate that when that happens >_>
I run mine with shaymin, though
12till someone won the way it's supposed to work
12and i won pretty much
Preferably, you
Yep

4i'm leaving
4it was nice chatting with you guys
G'evening peoples.
7Hai.
7Creideiki, y'know the program Finale?
Yes, I do know of it. I use it frequently.
7:D
03I use that too
03back when it was legitimately free
I have the full version of Finale 2007c.
7Can you fiddle around and fix a piano arrangement, please? o.o
7Printmusic 2010. ._.
Creideiki: lol seems the orthodox to the east really like their czars :p
7But I think that one's 2008. :/
03http://drfsupercenter.ath.cx/Program%20Installers%20&%20Accessories/Finale%20NotePad%202003%20Installer.exe
03that's the best one :P
03http://drfsupercenter.ath.cx/Program%20Installers%20&%20Accessories/Finale%20Notepad%202005%20Installer.exe <-- not sure if that's legit free
03I have a 2004 "demo"
7I've never tried MusicXML, but might as well now.
I have the full version of 2K3 and 2K4 though the reason I have those I would care not to explain; 2007c is because I pirated 2007... and then patched it. :P
7Okay, exported;
7Will upload.
Which upload service you use?
7Imagehost.
7http://h.imagehost.org/download/0195/VVVVVV_Positive_Force_Single_Piano
7One piano, treble and bass tracks. There should be a key change in-between.
/me catches stitch
/me curls into a ball and sleeps.
/me puts stitch on a pillow and walks away
/me waves
7Good. :)
Though, you know you can get a bit more texture out of parts if you use a secondary track/layer for some of the notes (less in measure ties.
7Hmm. Well, this is a piano arrangement. o.o
7I could give you the two-piano version...
I'm gone for the weekend
Bye everyone
:O
:<
12Smogon voted to make Salamence an uber
12i see they put back latias as well
It's an arrangement of a Buxtehude piece.
7Sorry, we can't find "www.mfi.re". We suggest that you check the spelling of the web address or search above.
MediaFire fails... http://www.mediafire.com/?g67uiaop8ub1qab
7Ah, those layers?
Yes.
7Problem is if you have, let's say, a quarter-rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, and a quarter note. On another layer, you have quarter rest, quarter rest, quarter rest, eighth rest, and eighth note.
7Or if you want, fill in one set of quarter rests with notes.
Well... there is a nice way of getting around the problem... for a print out.
One simple hides one set of rests and then just moves the other rests downward/upward to fill the blanks.
7Hides, eh?
Yep.
7How? o.o
7o.o
In F2007 all you need to do to hide a note/rest is have it selected is just hit the 'H' key.
7That's not working on PrintMusic. O_o
Hmm... time for the manual?
7http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/PrintMusic2010Win/PrintMusic_Left.htm#CSHID=9501|SkinName=NewWindow <-- dah?
7Huh, that's strange:
7It says to press H or O.
7Ah, I have to Ctrl-click.
7Nope. o.o
7Lol.
Simple entry is the same basically... Ctrl click and then H.
7But, oy, reformatting the music. D:
7Well, thanks for the tip, anyway.
7I'll get to it tomorrow.
Oh, has the newer version of Finale given you more layers?
7Four. o.o
(F2007 is still on four layers, though I do believe there are 8, I don't have easy access to the remainder.)
/me 7jots that down
7You don't mean the ^, do you?
Yes that one.
Also the ">" articulation also adds a tiny bit of volume.

Hi everyone :)
xD
hi
heeey Ariiii~
Can't sleep right now.
Actually, I just finished FMA volume 6 15 minutes ago.
I've run out of manga to read ;_;
12D:
12think of a deck idea
One that's not going to cost me a few limbs to get, preferably.
12budget decks
12are amazingly easy to make
I'll sell my kingdra for it if I have to
12which kind of kingdra?
Prime
12oh
And normal, actually
Not selling that one since I don't think it would sell for much
Compared to prime, of course.
12i think a good kingdra deck
12plays 3 prime and 1 normal
I've got 1 prime and 1 normal. Go figure that the deck I have the most materials for is the most expensive deck to get.
12what would that be?
See above
I don't even have fifty dollars to spend
On decks, that is
12i don't see it
Kingdra
Derp*
12kingdra isn't that expensive
12primes cost like nothing XD
12i think luxchomp depending on the build can easily be the most expensive deck
12considering some people play 2-2 Luxray
/me falls out of a quit message.
I blame deathgrip for that d/c.
/me catches Stitch in a net
/me catches stitch
:OOOO
HEY

/me bowls a strike with Stitch
:p
12XD
12hmm maybe i should make feraligatr abomasnow XD
0_0
12evolve snover into abomasnow
12below zero 60 paralyzed
/me runs like he'll
12keep repeating that process for as long as you can XD
but the use ends there.
12everone has like 60-80 damage on them
Oh sh
O.O"
12he overprices a lot of things but a lot of things i can get him on
12lol
I hate you again
:/
12heh
And I could sell a few of my cards through them as well
Get rid of this lanturn
12to see if he'll buy any of my old cards
Like*
I wish I could sleep.
12giving them a bunch of old cards that they won't be able to play later
:p
12basically the SV Magmortar has that power
I'm going to try to get some sleep again

12Hey you ^v^
Curly, I haven't either.
I actually dont like waterslides.
really?
Not out of fear, I just don't like them,/
well I've gone down every other slide except that one >.>
I dont have to do anything with the waterslides.
/me likes the valley of fear
I do food.
04I hope an events coming up soon
ohboy
12considering i haven't set foot in that chatroom since 2006 i was curious to see if any one remember me
Proto, he yelled some more and we had to kick him out.
Was it an iPhone4?
XD
how long have you worked there Spyro?
He's gonna sue. I can feel it.
12Lol
Like, a month
12Well I hope they have a Leeds event Tuffy
04Lol
woulda been funnier
12Hey they had a Leeds Shaymin event once and I happened to be on holiday that day down South :/
04eep
04Thats a distance from me
We didnt ruin it on purpose
Ooh.
Well that works out.
Andres, time left?
reminds me of xkcs
xkcd*
04I dont ._.
12hmm
oh
der
Andres?
we broke the andres D:
/me needs money for shaymin. :(
Stitch, can we do some team rounds?
04Im in a cottage for a week
apple did say that
they said that again at their press conference
like yesterday
04Lake District
12Hi TimeShift ^
12*^^
/me wants a ut D:
I tried to get my nexus to drop bars but it wouldn;t.
lol
04Uhh...I keep forgetting >.<
ut?
12Gah XD
where, we're about to start, just waiting for Andres.
Andres Andres Andres.
04Somewhere around Hawkshead
That all phones drop signals when held wrong
...
04It's raining.
my sentiments exactly, Curly
:3
Not to keep it going.
wtf Stitch is that per month?
No.
I know for sure you wontpay that per month
Actually..Only $75.
For a one-time installment of 1GB RAM.
/me only has 256MB right now.
I was like 5MB from maxing it.
Cut out one of the ut servers?
Even with 1 UrT server it's at 128.
how much are you paying a month?
$20.
Stitch, why dont you just run it on dragonite?
12Tuffy, Pooley Bridge near Ullswater
for $50/month you can colo a server at volumedrive
/me shrugs.
I thought shaymin would be easier.
I might colo some time.
/me doesn't have that kind of budget. XD
12Thats NOT camping ¨¨
and id set up VPSs on it for things.
it is - but still a bit different
/me isn't completely sure where his server is.
I know it's Seattle.
12Find out where you are Tuffy XD
04Ok lol.
04I'll ask Mum once she wakes up.
I like shaw. for my home net anyway
But anyway, if I am moving UrT to dragonite, it won't be tonight because it takes time and we all want to play.
12I lost my DS :/
04Oof!
oO
12It's in my house somwewhere.. I hope
12Because last time I had it was in this room.. then poof
/me really only got Shaymin to practice owning a server.
Can we play now pleeease? :D
04BIRDY the Pidgeot lv 37, Wibble the Poliwrath lv 37, Torment the Misdreavus 38, SickEmMOAR the Sudowoodo 36, Parsley the Meganium 38
With 10GB HDD and 256MB RAM, this really isn't a real server. XD
where, as soon as you find Andres.
12LOL
ANDRES!
12I like the name Parseley
/me just noticed LaptopAristeo.
04I got it from a kids show, the Herbs, Parsley the Lion
12that's genius XD
12I remember that :3
04Yeah, see whut I did thar?

Curly, my UrT is on my desktop.
I don't like using my desktop :<
Does it matter if I download voxel or quake unity?
/me pokes Stitch
I suggest Quake Unity if you live NW USA.
I live in florida
But they're the same files.
What's that map that I think is one of the default ones for ut, it's like an arabic merchant quarter place
Algiers?
i don't knwo how else to describe it
Yeah i think that;s it

04LOLOLOLOLOL look at that xD he really tried
04omg that has to go in the peas
12Hell is a swear word? XD
12I heard it wasn't
12When I asked a bunch of Americans here
04It's not
04it's the name of a place in the bible and as far as I know, the bible doesn't contain swearing.
04So therefore the word 'damn' isn't swearing either. Do you think they'd allow swearing in the bible? xD
it's a cuss word in america, especially the south
Yes
afaik
they allow ALOT in the bible
heh
for some americans even motherf**** is not an insult, but a very usual term :P

03er, both LOL, w/e the word is
03Commander Keen
03they were made in 1991, same year I was born :)
03old computer games, whcih is why it's fricking amazing
that music at first reminded me of goldeneye
03as it could easily have been SNES, it was literally groundbreaking
03like for its time it was the most amazing thing ever
xD
03XD
03weird, yes. But loads of fun, also yes
03and yeah I know XD
imagine hold up that in a bank robbery
*holding
03what, a stun gun?
03ah
03XD yeah
03I first got an N64 when I was like 11 LOL
03before that, it was just Keen, that's all I had
03that and like Tetris LOL
03heh
but argh
still does, like one of those comfort things you barely remember from diaper age
03yeah
03i quite literally grew up with it
that thing was beastly
crap
03LOL
03Get this
03that's how much computers were back then
D:
03and it was't even that great, it was just a normal Compaq desktop
..
D:
03after all these years
03and I was like OMGLOL
how did my grandma afford that LOL
03we bought it at Comp USA
03which doesn't even exist anymore
03I mean I'm sure they weren't ALL that much
03maybe like $2000 was a lower end computer
03but still, they were really expensive compared to now
/me is done reading BT guide

06I get it to boot up in some 20 seconds.
and the ones beside the paper
06Maybe 30 with my legacy machine.
and the one on the very top right?
Most XP computers take about a minute.
06Yeah, roughly.
14^wrong
03not the ones I run in a VM
There's some faster ones that take less.
03Those take about 10 seconds
06That's because they're in a VM.
03...
06Duh.
03the VM is going to have *less* power than my real computer dude
03if I felt like installing XP on here
03it would boot up instantly XD
inside the book?
06I've heard Win7 is crap.
14WinXP has always been the fastest Boot up OS
Aha

03Windows 7 is nice
14Win7 is nice

03-i
03I'm now a pro at it
14I'll stick to XP
ORLY nao, drf?
i am still missing two things now
03yarly
Me too
03sigh, stupid retainer
03I should prolly wear it more
03I like Ubuntu, but eh
Wooooooooooooooooo
03because I'm an A/V nerd
03audio/video, not antivirus
It works nicely for me.
03why would you want to?
03I just have a shortcut to music
lol wow "hired chinese"
how racist can you get
03if it listed the contents directly it would take up about 27 screens XD
:O
No :(
/me used it on a book and numbers came up
How do I do it :(
you sidestepped the question/
03I dunno how to do that
03I'm not saying I know how to do 100% of things
lol dont look it up Stitch !!
03+space
baw
u need the dragonball
:O
Is like magic
03the whole concept of them selling it
lol
now
06WTFBBQ
03yeah
03technically they're "selling support"< but you can't get RHEL for free
I like the actual concept but the selling part is silly.
03you have to pay a ton of money
*life and opinions
03*even
$80 for the desktop version.
03for one year...
Yeah, I got the battery :D
yeps
RedHat as in the OS is good, but the selling idea isn't.
03I still prefer Ubuntu
06Ewwbuntu
06lol
Stuck again
lol
03there's also Centos
Ubuntu is pretty useful.
Centos is bad. That's all.
i liek xubuntu
06i lik 2 tlk 2 da pplz
03I like just regular Ubuntu, 9.04
06You still have v9?
03Yes
0310.04 is terrible
06I got 10 myself, that explains a lot
03Stupid Mac OSX looking GUI, makes me want to hurt somebody
03besides native iPod support and that's just plain silly
03I know but I hate the GUI
0310.04's default GUI looks like OSX
03with the buttons on the left, to close and whatnot
03instad of the right
03*instead
06Yeah, it does actuallly
03it bugs me
03I like 9.04
06:S
i dont minde
Win7's GUI looks like Mac OSX's.
06Indeed
03no it doesn't
^QFT
03it looks nothing like it
06They ripped off OSX's Dock system
03it doesn't have a launcher, for one
03dock, w/e
03and wtf?
yes it does
03It doesn't have bouncing icons
03#1
06Lol
Rage
03#2, programs are only there if they're open
03OSX they're *always* there
03OSX has no transparency
06Transparency?
i'm stuck again
xD
lol
:o did ya do it?
you dont need it
:O
03W7 still has the X-buttons on the right
its not productive
03which is nice
03not the left
03what dock thing
Okay, forget the transparency, but it looks a lot like Mac OSX.
03My 7 looks just like XP
06Mine fixed the oil spill.
06:P
oh
lol
06It can fix anything.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/junh1024/4826268816/sizes/l/ < my desktop
hmm

and I moved the waste basket
Now to get into that Safe
03I have 8GB of RAM
03I don't care
:O
03http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/9775/capturegn.png <- my desktop
okayz
k
03looks a lot like XP/Vista to me...
03I see nothing resembling OSX in my setup.
It's actually quite fun. :o
:o i already did that
03um
03don't remember, why?
OH
03I think I have the first 3 BBC series

7Because foreign cars are popular?
:o
/me hides
you can't write patrolling without trol- okay that's just a bad one Dx
12Don't bother, considering they used the word "balls" after they got killed for swearing RIGHT after they were yelling about how they didn't do anything, I'd say it's Tiel having a laugh
07lol
07that doesn't sound accurate
05it is
7Hi, Alt.
Just heard something went on in here as well lol
7Yep.
12Just Tiel swearing LOL
12The usual, they swear, they die :3
Arti, at least she wasn't an oper :)
/me hides
07half the standard cars here are 2 liter engines that can't go much faster than 120 and don't get 50mpg
12LOL Espeon
added half of the people on my server to akill lol
basically banned everyone
12I read before, ROFL
http://comixed.com/2009/05/30/diesel-humor/
05exactly - i mean why don't they have them in the US?
xD
Anyway just checking in etc
12LOL AT PIC
07they do
12Ok, why does no one buy them then? XD
12Americans are on about price and cars now?!
12How much more expensive is Diesel over there by the way?
05and diesels are less expensive to maintain
hi
hi Xai
0530k??????
12Then why don't they sell Mondeos?
12ZS
07while a prius costs 22k
05wtf?
12*XD

Hi Stitch!
07that's expensive in the US
/me explodes.
I WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE SEEEEEEEN.
12Yeh but buy it second hand and it is!
o.o
2nd hand ftw
12XD
lol
12Unless they get loans
05except my mum
bill gates can :P
/me runs
12Yeh but she's also buying a house over half a million POUNDS
lol
12Loans, pff
:o
05yeah, cash too - no mortgage
05sucks, i want a house
12We have a house :3 but it's not ours technically LOL
05i got mine for ¬£3700 (new was ¬£17,800) for 3 years old
Loans are bad
12It could be a year if you want
bleh
finance is just as bad
07it could, but few people have the money
12Then again..
07then by that logic nearly every american would be walking
a friggen fiesta
or biking
lol
12But I was about to say, public transport doesn't exist over there does it? LOL
07public transport doesn't scale up well
12Yeh but driving through the whole of the US is like saying I'll drive through all of Europe
I would like to
12Or can afford to travel.
07the typical commute is an hour from suburb to city
07and public transport is mainly local
12Sounds like here
12People commute, we just have transport to do it with :>
:P
12Andrew LOL yes.. ok
12Maybe their paycheck *runs*
ha
05public transport has it's uses
07if you're taking a bus in SF, then you aren't going anywhere except within SF
07which is why everyone takes cars
12No one takes buses to get around the country here, it's train.
05i always think that an integrated system is best - it's not cost effective to have public transport to every hoime but likewise it's silly for people to sit in jams in the city
07since out of the dozens of cities surrounding SF, there's no public transport lines into the city
07well the bay area has bart
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewYorkSubway
7And my color somehow asploded.
07but even then there aren't enough stops
07that is the bay area's system lol
05certainly not la's
/me wants to learn to drive now XD
05ok, bye ra!
awww
12¬¨¬¨
bai Arti~
7Bye, Arti?

Not at all =P
It's a cool song :3
decent is pushing it
I like the pigeon one
oh and Zorua was kinda cool
i just don't want to get to the point where we have like 10 versions of a species in this case foxes
Or at least 16
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbPuTwo1bxs
well, we have bout 10 in birds :P
or more
and yesh
now they ask which gen
and i agree there are WAY too many birds now
ummm
the next gen alone introduces about 5
lol
we've yet to see the entire pokedex for 5th gen
I have been done since gen 3
Yeah
in the world of money there is no "retiring when you're at the top"
with exceptions, Leafeon and Glaceon, which *were* concepts by gen 2
you think that bratty crazy chick is cute?
well Eeveelutions
|3
Well...... she's cute if you turn off the sound
yes
And pretend she's at least 16
yeah, she has an adorable voice if you just don't listen to it :3
i guess it takes hacking/cheating ?
I have, after running a magnet over it :p
missingno is worse
Stitch: is that the movie 7lbs.?
tho 'm is even worse than Missingno
inf nuggets
^-^
suddenly money
yes
but why is 5th gen purposely using the #000 slot ?
lol
connection perhaps, maybe it was planned all along ?
yeah
but thy should stop
Yes'm
Many of those glitches really makes them look like lazy programmers
I loved missingno
pretty good vid
like yeah... storing temporary data in weird places
and movie
Never seen the movie.
Archimedes' principle is basically the physics behind buoyancy
lol
"Any floating object displaces its own weight of fluid."
and "Any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."
interesting
/me nods
It's physics ^_^
maybe something involving porygon ?
I just want them to stop
corruption perhaps ?
g2g
k
BBL~
And then buoyancy is all like "I'm never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down"
come on corruption of porygon would atleast be kind of a cool concept
yeah
but they should just stop making the series
lol corruption of Porygon
It also has a bit of the third law of physics in there two
yeah
Newton's third?
bye!
is bad egg officially a used bit of coding to prevent hacking/cheating ?
yes
i've always wondered if gamefreak/nintendo put that in on purpose
considering it's been in every gen except gen 1 (R/B/Y) that was good evidence for
Yeah
Yellow had no missingno
That one :3
yes it did
/me noms on physics
RBG did
yellow was spared the programming
http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingo#Yellow_Version_form
Yellow Amarillo is an awesome chracter
yes
missingo is in yellow
missingno*
sorry i typed that way too fast my bad
but she never was in the games =(
it's ok, I type fast too
i ruined my blue version catching too many missingno
D:
that sucks
/me hides
hmm apparently yellow missingno is WAY MORE DANGEROUS
behold the horror that is yellow missingno http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/3/3e/000Y.png

it's a refined way of saying that she makes them if she feels like it I guess
7Lol.
7The sprite contest was, well, a contest.

8D
Yep, I'm working on doing all the achievements now. :)
lol
I finally got all the COD ones, special ops were pretty hard. O_o
I didn't find them too hard in fact. In fact some of the "easier" ones proved hard n.n
Meh, I'll just do the single player ones then, I don't think much of the multiplayer.
lol
I hated the juggernauts in Favela.
7Espeon, Aero.
The one I found hardest was Snatch and Grab though.
The one in scrapyard.
You're drawing Espeon as an Espeon, right? XP
oh, Quan
Yeah.
I wish I had a scanner, I just finished drawing Orexa
7Ah.
7And yes, Aero.
she turned out good, too
How many IW times did you break? I only got one. XD
my favourite use of MW2 nowadays is tracking down those kids with high-pitched voices and make them mad 8D
Hahaha.
I'm in kind of a KH fanism X3
easy to do when you're trash to them unless you "quickscope" though.
I've gotten all sorts of threats. Sad really.
I like to piss off all the cocky retards. XD
Oh, well.
7Lol.
7Wait, did you finish TLS?
BRB, starting up my console (My monitor is also my console TV).

Well I like it, the story lasts longer than most games do (with my excessive playing XD), but the traveling around can sometimes get a bit boring.
Huge map.
04i see

J
7Ah.

I uncheck it and it just rechecks it every time I hit okay

hi Stryker, and .... was that on purpose Raccoon? >____>
Hehe, Curly caught it
xyzzy :3

can someone do a /me without highlighting me? >.>

I just wanted to highlight you I swear ;)

/me is eating up 40 KB of memory every 10 seconds on each server.
Umm
No you're not
er wait
20 KB
the same?
I can't see any bans being set on #xyzzy.
in the channel window?
i see them scrolling by rather quickly
unless old bans are falling off the stack
but i can't tell because the list is too large for a non-oper to view
Memory on all servers is staying constant
/me peeks in after being gone for 11 months.
:o
:o
thanks :)
You're very welcome :)
:D
Is Shayman the default now
I'm on shatmin

Awww, well, the channel's broked now
:(
/me just closes it
/me blinks

:o

That's like the first rule of quality assurance / network security consulting
hi J
/me shakes his head
/me points to the production sticker on the window :3
now to unban them all :)
oooh
hi Aero
where where!
umm isn't it just /clearban
Come on
that worked :)
/me facepalms
Was that intentional?
chanserv attempted to clear the banlist
it was not successful
/me has a script
#xyzzy
you may have ops
:)
wb
HOW MANY BANS DID YOU SET
a few 10 thousand
Well there is the problem with the script
um, not likely
I overloaded
the server was unwilling to send 12 megs worth of banlist to you
Why...
because it's 12 megs
No
[19:30] * Quits: +Corevette789 (your@EBC82D.F3A873.898A59.D396C8) (SendQ exceeded)
lol
ha
he just spammed the banlist with random characters
the maze of twistly little passages had a cave in. :(
Hmm
PROTO
:D
at first i wanted to see how many bans you could set per MODE
Aah
then it turned into figure out the size of the banlist and propogation
i learned that only the first 101 bans propogate between servers
after that, a channel becomes desynchronized
then their bans wont leave their local server
sort of bugs that were fixed way back in Hybrid 5
That's a pretty good way to get banned off a network
but i can be helpful in identifying issues if left to my own devices.
just checking the tires.
that would take time away from actually finding bugs :p
then it becomes work
Try it on Freenode...I dont liek them
xD
they're pretty matured right now
and they switched to a different codebase that appears quite stable
Or ChatSpike xD
But you wouldent let #UESPWiki come over here
Would you?
Raccoon I havent seen any here
Corevette789: Sure, if they want to
Corevette789, YOU SAID THE U WORD!
?
I would like all my channels on this server
Right
Lol
/me just found out he knows an InspIRCd developer. :o
I met Brain on ECNet. :o
Dr. Brain?
Raccoon, ChatSpike.
Stitch...NO
I KNOW but sacrificed must be made.
sacrifices*
>_>
i know a coder by that name
codes for CS?
ChatSpike
doh
irc.chatspike.net took me to stitch.chatspike.net
Yep
XD
Thats a server name no relation
Not my server.
\o/
And Stitch doesn't either
Stitch: do me a favor and don't tell anyone about my obnoxious endevors
XD
http://www.aristeo.info/2010/06/01/why-chatspike-should-be-boycotted/
I haven't.
lol oh gawrsh
would they mind much if i took their ChanServ away?
Raccoon, if you do try it on CS, do tell me how it goes.
i have to thank Corevette789 for giving me the idea of crashing chanserv
Raccoon: They'd be mildly inconvenienced, probably, if they noticed
Raccoon I'm on there now
I really wanna see you do it
xD
#xyzzy
Lol he's doing it
:O
/me can do that
Oh deal
dear*
Don't associate this network with it, please

I'm not going to
Raccoon, you too
/me too.
..
Which means I should probably pick a different alias.
But yeah, that's how to grayhat :3
lol
:P
it's OK if it's someone else's network :>
Well, no
Exactly
But it's okay if it's CS
how many of you are using mIRC?
you can help
Or Freenode
I am
/me isn't.

I can't stop you from doing whatever you want to do on ChatSpike, but I would prefer if you used a channel off the network to coordinate it
/me feels reaaaaaaaally uncomfortable about having coordination discussion on here

No, is it a comic?
7?

haha
apes suck
this is why humans are superio
*superior
7humans are superior because, theoretically *cough*, we're more intelligent and sapient
7I can go grab you a link
yeah and apes aren't
hence them getting beaten by spyro
7it's currently in the third book
Kja: Also, we have the ability to form a social unit that no animal (of for some, "other animal" could create.
*or for some
i hate apes
Sure, give me that link.
7It annoys me when people refer to sapience as sentience
lol sparx
7there we go
7ok
7I'll go grab the link quicksies
I'll get the link after.
Okay, or now.
i'm on the gaul boss fight
i wish he didn't take away spyro's mana
I never understood why they did that.
another way to po the gamer
i also don't get why gaul hates spyro
7eh. he's gone already
and why he kidnapped cynde
*cynder
if he hates dragons
why'd he take one
well kidnap definitely lured spyro there
You don't have to like someone to work for them.
7and why did Convexity start randomly collapsing like that?
7at the end of TEN, wasn't his body formed of coalescing smoke?
7why not just go find some camping cheetahs
amen
.... why i never really pay attention to stories in vide games
/me throws his shirt at the crowd.

10WHOO

10stupid DOTD makers
10i know right
too lazy to change it.....
10ehh
i hate that cynder pushed spyro out of the beam
7actually, no it's not. it's just stupid
10hmmm
10probably
i guess she knew he was corrupted
10i mean they say
how come we don't see cynder in TEN?
10so like WTF

10haha lol
10oh okay

10greed is good
except for the furies
10j/k
i wish they had the furies they had in ANB and TEN
7every time I see that I keep thinking people are saying furries. although both would be applicable
i thought Cynder breaths convexity
lol
7convexity is a place, not a substance
7you can't breath French
i meant the breath
7when does she use it?
at the end of ANB
oh
and let cynder to die
7that's because people get oddly vehement about games
7they would make bad religious leaders
well spyro breathes convexity
7... when?
at the end of TEN
and ANB
7not convexity.
7convexity is a place.
7not a substance
lol
7you don't breathe Spanish

Thanks, dude.

ever since the voice thing
7anyway, the reason I originally brought it up was because I'm gunna be helping the dude with a future arc-book-thingy on it
Oh, I see. Epic.
but I dunno. I guess you can ask him. but he'll probably be growling at me for telling people here on IRC.
voice..thing?
7I know
drf; yes
but I'm FAR to lazy to tell you
weren't they dogs...
7they're dogs
No, they're called cats.
7they're the legendary dogs
Lies! xD
>.> dogs
7I understand both are applicable
7it's just that dogs is more common
Fair enough.
7he's now doing an arc that focuses entirely on the legendaries.
7Lugia is leading a revolution against him

12hmm
12I can't wait for this movie to come out

04i don't make decks
04i just copy othe peoples decks XD
lol
you should try making one
04that's why i always wait until i drink something
04for some reason
04its like it burns my cheeks
thats how it 'cleans'
then when you wash the residue off you can actually feel it

yeah
doesn't bother me
Ok...
I know
04and there you go
04you just exiled their entire deck XD
but you don't HAVE to
Well' I've been alright myself.
04i don't know if there are any cards
it can be deterred by reliquary tower + drawing cards
04that get bonuses like that
04btw
04i found this other card
04lol it's effect is the best effect ever

04so basically the 2nd you play it down
04*second
04you can no longer win
haha i beat skabb

04having them both out would sort of be ".... why are we playing again?"
get this
those medium size guys he unleashes
they threw bombs
and the bombs hit him
as well as my flail

my sis is gonna let me borrow her comp.. eventually ><
04ok
04hopefully you can find the file
shouldn't be hard to find

04basically it's a planeswalker with a -1 ability
Is gay marrige even legal in Florida? lol.

D:
04so you get baneful omen out, get Liliana Vess then use -2 to put gleemax to the top of the deck

Normal vaccinations aren't that bad. The most annoying vaccination ever has to be the smallpox vaccine. I felt like blagrh for a week.

If I did that I would definitely loose a lot of quality
*lose
Luckily I don't lose any, really. I suspect it'sd enhanced. :O
But the sound is just a fraction of a second off, since it comes from my computer speakers.
hmm
that would make sensse
If I hook up speakers to the HDTV, though, it might not lose any.

I'm not gonna lie, The Police were amazing.
I don't mean The Police

I don't think I said only.
Because I evern like Daisy a little.

Oh, I gotcha.
Yeah, I agree.
Daisy's only good song, really.
my fav on daisy was Noro
Wait, was In A Jar on Daisy?
yes it was
Never mind. Two then.
I don't think I liked much from YFW.
It's been a while since I've heard it.
Crap, "You Stole" was also good off of Daisy. I totally forgot about it.

I hate when people make you feel inferior because you're not knowledgeable in one subject, typically one you have little interest in.

Why, the name?
I should've used a different nerdy reference when I chose my name
yeah
I think you told me once

My other friend did this to my other other friend, during a quiet meeting somewhere, and it was like 80 messages referring to [censored]es.
because apparently the texts he made were sent to everyone in his contacts
and I'd get totally spammed with crap about a baby
LOL
XD
my roommate's phone did that
like i got one that says "you have to take care of him he cries he poops"
...which means I got texts meant ofr his girlfriend
and another that said "now I'm feeding the [censored]er"
that was...awkward
wow
XD
/me laughs.
A lot.
you have to take care of him he cries he poops
oh wow
She explains that she is nursing the kid? xD

02Yeah I know
did you know a 747 blows out about 8 tons of fuel if it needs to abort a landing attempt?
12WOAH
12No XD
yes
12How high off the ground by this point, though?
02XD
02Hey
02or moderated properly for that reason
12Sheesh.
that's the amout for an emergency-go-around
02I mean seriously
02All those thread
02s
I can see him tell his members to "troll" "New GV"
and the fuel is only good for one of those maneuvers
because, to carry these 8 tons of extra-fuel, the plane needs around 12 tons of fuel itself from the start
02If he does try that
the fuel calculations itself is fun, too
02and/or report him to forumotions
Make that or
calculate distance, calculate average flight speed, calculate average windspeed = time to destination in hours
multiply hours with 30 liters of fuel
just report him to fmotions if he reports the site. He's reportable for member abuse or something I bet.
calculate alternate airport
add fuel for distance to alternate airport
02XD
add 15 liters emergency reserve
add 10% inproper maneuvering reserve
result: Amout of needed fuel
Can't wait to see his response to calmly asked questions

Real coffee?
From the hills

Any specific type of tea?
Blaaaaack :o

Didn't taste the same trying to make it myself :(
Hmm..
Too much hassle to order it online?
I am on now ^^'

/me pokes
How are you?
that's something perhaps worth correcting
The income is good, but not steady.
debit cards work too
checking accounts without debit cards work too
Most such payments are pretty much restricted to the USA, are they not?
PayPal is accepted pretty much world wide, isn't it?
Mmhmm
have you tried?
sure, i live in the US, but I'm pretty sure PayPal has methods for transfering money via bank wire... aka checking account.
thats how they do it here
No, no moneys :3
/me shrugs.

GOOD
14WHUT?!?!
dA doesn't want you. D:<
no they dont
14Why?
14I use dA all the timez.
I know it is
14That's why they call it language arts! :D
I just think it would be ridiculous if i did
oh snaps
03o.o
14How would it be ridiculous? There are plenty of people on dA that use it just for writing purposes.
bbl
14Well, then! :<
/me 14is sat on.
03sigh
03but I can't sleep in cars

Have you tried to be in one?
14Well you certainly didn't imply that you AREN'T in one.
03so that should narrow that down for you.
Are they spies?
03no

03um
14Apparently it is if you can go to jail for it.
03in some situations no but that's very rare
14Then again that's a matter of opinion.
03like 99.99999% of murders aren't OK
14burn
/me 14hides.
12Oh ya Xai's absolutely FINE ¬¨¬¨

03yeah
03we just drove by a billboard that said:
03EW INVASION OF PRIVACY
ick D:
well
03also
03:)
/me hides
I think the parents should know at least slightly
especially if their kid is young
03meh
hi
hey
whats up
eh
7evening all
hey kja
12Off out..
7D:
lol
cool
and that's the only one I know
You sure dislike JPG xD
I named him HURRRMAGIC
lol
more like HUURRFIAH
03well Paint notoriously sucks at it
....[censored] I should've named him that
7It reduces quality, Espeon, that's all.
lol
LOL
7I've only beaten like 3 Kanto gyms
7Yep.
/me 7suddenly realizes she needs to lighten up.
/me 7looks at memes.
7and I never bothered to properly explore Victory Road
7not at the right time, and now I can't find it again, but still
03JPG the format is fine
03but Paint just sucks at saving it
cool
Exactly.
depends on the version of Paint you're using
03No
the Win7-Version of paint is quite good in fact
03even the newest one fails
not really.
03Nope
03it's not
Win7 paint doesn't.
03it's exactly the same as the older ones, all they did was change the default type ton PNG
03>_>
03*to
Yeah xD
and more confusing
03also EW THE RIBON
03*RIBBON
03^ more confusing, yes
03I got rid of it
03and put in the Vista one
Paint is good if you know how to use it.
annndddd I want to know how to do that
|D
i dont =\
03well
03I like it for things such as print screen and paste
Oh yeah
03why open up some superbloated program like Photoshop if Paint does the same thing just fine?
03yeah
plus cropping is confusing in those programs
03and the one cool thing about Paint
you can't just drag the canvas to enlarge/make it smaller
03it automatically adjusts the canvas size
03yeah
Also, you can make anti-aliased lines in Win7 paint
xD
resizing
03um
03Paint cannot resize
03only crop
03o.o
7Lag gone again.
It can
7Without quality loss, that is.
sort of
it can do it, but in a very crappy fashion
03how?
7Right click, stretch/skew.
stretch/skew
03If you change the size of the camvas
03*canvas
7Type in the percentage.
03that's cropping
lol
03........
03oh
03well
03that uses Nearest Neighbor
03EW NEAREST NEIGHBOR
that really kills the quality
7Or the control +/-
Yeah
7What?
03Works awesome XD
ooooh i hate chatting on my phone
enlarging anything is hard to do without quality loss
03EW UPSCALING
7Except vectors.
03vectors don't count

correct Tier - it's an ENTIRE DESASTER to play ANYTHING with it....
03EW QUICKTIME
I don't use it as my primary one xD
03Use MPC.
I use WinAmp for everything
except DVDs
03WTF WINAMP
03Winamp is an AUDIO player
03it's not for videos
Nah.
it can also play videos drf...
It plays videos fairly well.
...lame enough
oooh i hate clones
7Wanna ask someone here to kill it?
But I use VLC for DVDs and movies and shiz
2yes
2please
2:D
03um
03I don't have oper here

03I've been saying it

03>:|
03also
03RULES File is missing <- FAUIL
03*FAIL
enfore them - or leave
7Does it say we can't do whatever that person did?
03Show me the rule that bans filesharing?
03Hmm?
03Because AFAIK there is none.
03Stop making up rules as I said.
we have
read up the rules
03RULES File is missing
03Sure
wassup!
03LOLwut
okay, that is just stupid xD
03seriously STOP POWER ABUSING
and you start reading
7I don't see it, TimeShift.
03http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
03There is NO RULE sayin gyou can't have file servers.
03-g
2lol
:D
03and his file server only shows if you type !list
2served
2!list
03*allowed
03so as i said, don't abuse power.
Hi...
I'm cooking right now, gotta feed these kids....
2hm
2i dont understand this time differance
7'alo, Time?
oh ok
2not only am i in america eastern but i also dont understand the 24 hour time thingy
:o
I don't see a single rule in reference to filesharing
03that's because there isn't one
03you mean like 16:00?
2yeeees
2i hate that
2it confuses me
it's simple
7Subtract 12.
03just subtract 12
03yeah
7And attach a PM.
and makes helluva more sense than A.M. and P.M. imo XD
03well
03wait
http://www.lugia.us/chat-rules.htm
03TimeShift, I read that
Okay, back...

7:|
LOL
that wasn't there
ever
until now
xD
Okay this is just silly <-<
03-p
2poooower abbbuser
03TimeShift, having a file server is different than only using a channel to share files...
maybe I'm the only one not wanting a lawsuit against Arti and Xai?
03he actually talks on here
03so that's a retarded rule.
well, he should decide
03TimeShift, you don't know how fservs work, do you?
2why would a lawsuit happen against arti and xai
2...
03You can't just turn them off for a single channel
03it's either on or off
this rule is not negotiable
03and this isn't the only place he goes on
2im going to side with timeshift because he has the POWAH
/me 7blinks
just because someone has power doesn't mean that they are always in the right.
2yah but
Same.
7-o3o
7:3
This IS Arti's site
i still dont wanna <censored> him off and get kicked :3
7Erm...
You guys should consult her
Before making a rule.
lol wow
Just imho.
SEE?
D:<
03the "you guys" is just TimeShift, none of the rest of us think this makes any sense at all
that was just the swear filter lol
oh
wb
did i swear?
xD
yes
XD
7Yes.
2what did i say? xD
03yeah, apparently the "p-word" is swearing

lolcensorshiplol
2D:<
03LOL
7Then get kicked.
03nah, the censor filter I agree with

03and you can just censor yourself
best show evar!

goodnight all
hi where
Uh
Proto
>.>
...
me beats his tab key savagely
Uh
...
/me does that
as in, /me instead of me'
>.>
<.<
nice, where xD
:/
:o
I'm um... acclimatizing my body for my shifts
Murrrnapples :3
It's either way past bedtime, or nowhere near getting up time.
I see.
/me hits where
wat
It;s for her own good :O
You'll never get to sleep once the mean sun comes up[
D:
/me pew pews the mean things
:o
Busy busy busy
:O
Very busy.
I don't like the sound my 360 is making with this cracked disk in it
:(
why are you trying to run a cracked disk? O_o
Because it's my only copy of modern warfare
Consoles don't spin them very fast
compared to PCs
where, I know
But it's got two noticeable cracks in it
does that disk even work? >.>
Yes
I should have taken it back when I first got it
My copy of Halo is like that, still si fine.
360 not explodeded.
that's it
/me turns it off
but there are console exclusives like 3d dot heroes!
which I really want
But at any rate
one second
was making a *dunkita dunkita dunkita* sound
>Console exclusive
>really want
wat
Means it's only available on one console
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL3qVfemEp4
come on, you can't not want that!
Hm.
Actually looks okay
I want it
But can't afford a ps3 :(
Despite looking at 3 seconds ofit
I want Blazblue and Geometry Wars too among other random things
/me went outof map in MW2
/me enjoyed that
>_>
I like how bullets actually push you back in the modern warfare (call of duty in general?) series
I know someone that doesn't like games like MW
because of how realistic the damage thing is
and how easy you die on veteran
why are they playing on veteran then? >.>
if you play on recruit it's easy
MW is way harder than MW2
yeah
:o
MW2 had a harder veteran mode I think
On vet B)
I can actually not suck in MW2
Not for me.
you can't not have Alien Swarm
I don't have alien swarm
it's free :O
which runs not well
on a netbook
lol
Off to bedtime now :o
people's reactions when I tell them we didn't have a computer until 2009
bye where
O_o
good night where o/
yeah, something like that xD
But that's like living in the pst, in the future, which is now in the past!
\:O/
I live in PST >.>
wat
Pacific Standard Time :D
Is that a timezone?
Nice one where
Nooo
+10 ftw
>:O
I just like the province I live in <3
And leaving Proto and Curly behind Dx
I'm used to being left behind
bye o/

/me doesn't want to leave Proto behind Dx
It's never bothered people before
/me forcibly cuddles Proto goodbye then runs away
Don't touch me where

123009 0313 8675
no\
2soooo 8x-9=3
oAo
2why not D:
14 4x, yes.
14So 8x = 12, add 9 to both sides.
2thenadd 9 to both sides
2making 8x=12
14Then divide by 8.
2then dicide by 8
2divide
2xD
I don't think you need to divide
It's just simple algebra
2w.5
2 1.5
year*
6I went straight to geometry my frosh year
:/
12hmm
I need to get back to school
2i mis geopetry
2geometry*
2i hate algera
2ALGEBRA*
14One thing I don't get is the addition of logic. (No pun intended.)
augh I'm going to be taking geometry with /all/ the freshmenppl regardless of math level .A.
2doesnt lati have her first day of school today?
6most freshmen take geometry
127
2she said today was the first
6so that's not anything weird

6small task?
12getting the mail lol
6how long does that take?

12lol
Not really
I failed calculus x.x
2:(
2its algebra
lol
2 4x-9=3+4x
um
that's impossible
you end up with 9=3
2i know D:
2thats whyim stumped
are you sure you aren't reading it wrong?
lololololololoooooool
as that problem doesn't work
2 4x-9=3+4x
2that exactly it
12no solution
then write "this problem is invalid" LOL
or that
2xD
12-9=3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V1gEjtmm9M&feature=related
2obviously -9 is the same as 3

2ok, ok il do the next one
2lol
2oh shoot there is 3 VARIABLES
2WTFFFF
2U CANT DIVDE BY 0
correct
ur doing it wrong
2of wait
2nvm
6corr-
6dkuhfd
6:|
2its -3
2;D
12either that or once again no solution
2no
2no other ones can be invalad
12our teacher gave us a whole bunch of no solution problems on purpose
6but they can be invalid?
/me 6runs
http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/90166100-8131-4a76-a6b0-1ae3a755c211.jpg
12yeah it spells no solution
2LOL
2unTrust bank
6lol
2-8+5x=3x-11+5x
2go drf go :D
um
also
that's not 3 variables
12you know you should be doing this
Even the official website doesn't have drivers for it anymore. XD
:(
3 variables is like x+y+z=4
2not that one
anyway let's see
2i got the one with 3 variables
-8=3x-11
But it'll work, I guess.
3x=3
x=1
2your good D:

14There's a list.
....... yuck
okay I'll check it out
ugh i hate glitches
just remember to try on the glass slipper first.

Blah I should have finished the second book yesterday but my mind was on school all day
rise over run
or y/x
Good...
lol
man i hate spyro
2LOL
2this wont be easy
2im trying to find the slope and y intercept from a graph
lol
10WHOS MA MAID OF HONOUR?
14That's not easy? Owo
2i can draw the graph using text :D
>.>
14Do you have the equation?
2i hate maths D:<
2its a bunch o lines
Nintendofreak....
2no equation
I know...
14Okay, the slope is easy: Find two points where the line intersects the grid.
urgh
not again
10he's not gay either
i keep dying
Oh.
10i can give tips
14Preferably at an intersection.
2 0,0and 2,1
Baby....
14In this case, 2 - 0 and 1 - 0.
10yeah
it's skabb
second time around
non of those are it
tried
died
10spam?
10lolWTF
14Damos, the application DRF linked?
2um
finally
now i kill him
2lets use 2,1 and 4,2
2so i can see the numbers
10HALLEXHAM
DRF linked?
10yeah
2what would be it?
10thats always best
2yah
2x is first
14And subtract one y by the other.
10god
2so 4-2 and 2-1?
see i used regular spyro
This does not even deserve a captains log >:[
14Yep.
http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/27085ffa-ee0d-4fef-8ff7-20de3d890411.jpg
LOOOL
Wtf?
2sooo 2, 1
14Now put those values as y/x.
10i know
14Altogether:
10i think one might be planning to do me#
if It helps any this was on a laptop call Averatec
10ehh
at least skabb only has 1 bar
14'(Y1-y2)/(X1-X2)
the second time
D:<
14-'
2wouldnt it be the other way arund?
10i'll just cut off his dong
O_O
:O
woah
2ok
da da da da damn
are you doing equations
14So what's 1 divided by 2?
10hey i dont mess around
2.5
2o_O
14Yep.
Why am I still on mistclan? lol
were it (x1 - x2)=m(x1-x2)
like the stick figures on crack
2so the slope is .5
10OMG
they say da da da da damn
CRACK!
me too
14Yep.
I have!
10by Hopdiddy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9geRUp9Blw

10I KNOW ITS AWEOSME
I remeber how to do that
2so -3, 1 and -2, 3
2give me a minute
2 1.5?
2or 2
14(3-1)/(-2 +3)
14 2/1
10YEAHH
wait
2so 2
CHUNKY!
14Yes.
(y-y2)+m(x-x2)
there
2i get iiiitt
lol
14Got it? 'w'
2thats easy _@
2@_@
14Great. ^w^
10AWW
10what kind?
10CHUNKEH!
I'm sorry baby. :3
2what about he y-intercept?
10god you make me very aroused
>.>
2the*
2yah
lol
14Err, wait:
2 0
14Is it the other way...
!define y-intercept
chunky!
-!- In coordinate geometry, the y-intercept is the y-value of the point where the graph of a function or relation intercepts the y-axis of the coordinate system.
darkshadow....
10HBEY
10lol
yes?
14Okay.
14So, yeah.
SHIT JUST GOT REAL!
10start puttin abut a dozen eggs in a bowl
10mix the FUCK outta them
10and whaddaya get?
10PENIS!!!!!
o.O
14Y-intercept = (0, y)
lol
win!
2wher the line crosses hrough the y axis?
it's awesome
14That's why they call it a y-intercept. 'w'
I did.
oh
2ooohh i see

lol
6well
6I did that
6raikou went right D:
03because of something
12What are you on about?
6FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
03but I have never heard that in *legit* cartridges
6I went right this time, he went left
03This console is actually licensed by Sega
hi.
12?
Now I'm watching transformers...
12What are you playing?
6...
6lol
I meant the consoles
12what bit?
12OHHHHH'
12YOU'RE CHASING IT
6beaten all 16 gyms, just tracking entei and raikou
6...
12I THOUGHT YOU WERE PLAYING WITH IT XD
6yes D:
6....LOOOOOOOL
6I wish D:
oh cool
6...?
6what do you mean?
6what was different in the DPPt?
6oh
6yeah
6but it's not that bad
i'm watching taking of pelham 124
12aaaand
*123
12Yeh it is
03I bought a RetroGEN
6in GSC/RSE you had to check the actual pokedex
03Which is some Chinese thing that was licensed by Sega
12The Pokeymans are randomly moving rather than moving away from you all the time
12Yeh it's stupid
6they have a pattern
6you just have to intercept |D
12Yes the pattern is that if you move towards, they move away
Thats the exact definition
12You rarely ever collide paths
6not exactly
-!- No results found
one thing i like about hannah montana is amber and ashley are gone
>_<
6they have defined paths
6that reset every once in a while, or if you fly
6yeah, and quite often they're move towards you
03well
12Yes but they still follow the same pattern, like two piece chess
6which is why you fly again
7Chess, eh?
7Chess implies AI?
6fly to mahogany, check map, fly if they're not near, repeat
The term is coined to aftermarket consoles
12So are you saying that you fly each time rather than walk?
03oh
6arti, I've had them run into me
6arti yes
6I fly to mahogany
03!define RetroGen
03er
!define RetroGen
-!- No results found
6and fly to mahogany from mahogany
03:/
12I always do it by route borders
6it's annoying, but it works betetr than whatever you're suggesting lol
12Lol
12Ok I'll try that D:
o.o
6if you're just walking between routes
6yeah, you'll never catch them
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_hardware_clone
It's weird that the autobots kill two decepticons, that were only hiding.
That's good movie.
Cronker Live and reloaded/ Bad Fur Day reference
6I was pro at tracking latios/latias in RSE
12I sit on the borders and walk back and forth until they move enough for me to collide with them at one route change
12It's complicated..
6arti, that stupid XD
Hello peoples
13backy
13backy
hi all
6and it's easier to collide
6LOOOL
03hi
12I just found opening the fly menu was too much annoyingness
12Ok
6my only problem is I need to paralyze them still D:
13KABOOOM
12I use sleeps
6hmm
6well
13how do you play?
6I mean, you'll still run into them
lolwb
6and?
6you'll find them after
12Guys?
Ahh...
Why are you here again? xD
6meh?
12TimeShift DELETED his account
13yes
6...
7o3o
7O.o
10o.o
Just curious
12I think
6o-o
12I can't find it >v<
13what do you mean?
O______O
13OO
12Pretty sure..
6quan
13da da da dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Well
6WAY too coincidental
12TimeShift
12Guest
7Eh?
I mean, you're usually on TST, I rarely ever see you here
10Yeah, he deleted it
13don't look at me I didn't do it
10"Guest"
6that's going a little
6um
6childish
12FFS
6um
10Eh, he did it once before, with the competition thing
12I'm seriously annoyed
7So he got demoted and quit?
12Yeh but he never deleted his entire account
DDDDDDD:
12Quan no, his position altered slightly
13well I actually forgot the name of this site and I didn't do anything about it T_T
Lol, really?
12Also before I even changed anything I asked him first, he didn't reply then quit.
13true
12Well how can he be if he deleted his account?
12this is pathetic
13brb
Did something happen on TST to make you come here or something? Or did you just want to?
xD
13btb
ok
7What was the difference between TimeShift's positions?
10There's a way to restore accounts, right?
nou
he's online right now
12No
swimming skitty = bad
6skylands, why would that do anything?
12He permanently deleted it
10:/
6he'd just not come on even if it could be restored
7Can you back up an individual account?
12Yep
12I can backup anything that's backed up
12:>
6lol
12Nope not anymore
7The account itself, I mean.
12His behaviour though..
10Back, but busy
6this is ridiculous
12Yes
6yes we did
man this movie is good
12He didn't respond, just quit, before I'd even done anything.
10WTF TimeShift deleted his acount??
12Yes -v-
10*account
10Wow
6watch him ignore you about this
:~=TTC=~TimeShift: I prefered to leave with the last bit of honor left"
6hey look, entei :>
6...
6ok
7O_o
/me forgot to mention that he left D:
6not to be rude
6but
6LOOOOOOL
Anyone want to say anything?
12Honor? What's this got to do with pride and that?
Maybe someone noticed.
This one is too.
7Sounds like NightShadow.
6what honor is left when you walk away in such an immature way
!legendary
:o
but PM?
Hi Andres :)
7Wanted to go out with a bang.
6nothing had even happened, he just simply ignored us
12even though I've met him in person lol
03LOL
10Armageddon, PM
03TK, PM.
transformers?
Hai! :D

k
except nintendofreak
7Eh, you can look a different age you are. :P
Someone do something
6ok, well
12Lol Quan I've seen his passport :>
6he's got the stupidest outlook on "honor"
And everyone else who's always quiet...
yeah
!define honor
-!- award: a tangible symbol signifying approval or distinction; "an award for bravery"
6how is completely ignoring us, when we were trying to talk to him in a civilized way, honorable?
7No, not quite: that's the noun.
6if you want to be straight, he lost it ages ago
13backy
13backy
a spyroforum member
12one of the forum's moderators
yep
~=TTC=~TimeShift: it's not the loss of power. It's the loss of trust"
0!legendary
~=TTC=~TimeShift: farewell
Yep...
6loss of trust, he should be in here to keep him from losing
7:|
6*it
he left at that moment
6so
6I don't really care lol
10same here L/
10*:/
03OK WTF
03This RetroGen console comes with built in games
03Some of those built in games also don't work right
03WTF
oh hey nintendofreak
7I wouldn't say he was untrustworthy; on the darker side of moderation, yes.
13so why did Timy delete the account
I was going to ask him if he could really accept losing all the work he put into the site
o.o
but he left
12still getting owned in muramasa.....
10Damos, read above

04lol
10I'm want to speak with you privately :P
04drf
13Sky you've been spying on me?
We didn't.
Sure XD
Eh, doesn't matter.
04?
10GAH I gotta go
10I
10I
10GRR
04cy
04cya*
bai Feather~ O:
They hate HoR for no reason
10I'll be back around in around an hour hopefully
10XD
I wouldn't even ask XD
XD
04lol
04nope
unless I've just gone past their minds XD
04not to me at least
04I mean
haters gonna hate
04it's a place where people can hang out and discuss Ho-Oh and other topics without getting bashed by the community or being flamed
04I mean
*is thinking the same thing as Aero*
03Nobody bashes people for discussing Ho-Oh here
04pfft
13brb
13no bbl
lol ok
13bbl
kk
04anyway
03which is dumb
04so?
03and seeing as how it was inspired by TST anywayl...
03-l
Yeah
apperently we get the hate D:
loldramatime?
04actually, there is alot of flaming of Ho-Oh on here wgenever we try to talk about it, which is why there hasn't been any discussion about Ho-Oh here
04but you know
04nevermind
03after seeing how awesome TST was LOL
10[20:16] <Damos> Sky you've been spying on me? <- No, I can see everything that's being said on #Silverwings
lol
12heh
loldrama
12they could to go HoR and basically have the same TST experience then without that one person
HoR has other members from other sites, however the majority are from TST
12but as far as they knew didn't know HoR existed
lol whos ddosing
Termz
I went there because I was friends of Nightshadow and yeah lol
03well
^ times 100
03which is like
03they used to go here
03then they switched to HoR
03and now they brought over people with them that ALSO no longer go here
03they're fricking stealing our members
/me runs
XD
03it's just like
03if everybody was on both that would be fine
03but people leaving TST to go to HoR just p¬°sses me off
whos that
Some people there have never heard of TST
03I know
03that's not my problem
03in fact most people here haven't heard of #pokemon-originals either
12drf also sometimes i tend to think being more popular
03but the few people from TST I told about it are still here
Just get the host to setup a hardware ddos filter.
12being the more popular community
12is a bad thing, it's something i've hardwired into myself
We never made HoR to be that way :P
Granted, TST has at least one per month on the forums alone
7Well, expanding community.
Happens to all sites
that grow
04wat
The server doesn't seem to be lagging.

the slidey one
12Skylands i heard serebii is really bad
12but i never checked it out because i have no interest in going there
10It is
10I signed up there back in 2009, only stayed for a week
10That's how quickly I soon despised it
12anyway i think it would be in everyone's best interest if this talk of communities is dropped
12who agrees?
12i leave my closing statement as "i'm neutral"
10The silence speaks for itself
12hmm silence does speak volumes at times
12honestly though i owe a lot to TST
12however too much growth can be a bad thing
I lasted for like 2-3 weeks on Bulbagarden
7I thought we'd stop this discussion.

I'm searching for assistance.
I was once one of the biggest Spyro fans.
About six years ago I began that forum.

Ugh.

ANyway.
Okay.
Yeah.
See, after leaving the Spyro fandom in 2006...
I came upon a Pok√©mon wiki.
Bulbapedia.
Uhh... D:
I currently am in charge of that wiki.
/me puts some pants on then, unless he is reading the last one wrong.
XD
o.O seriously?
I check bulbpedia all the time
/me curls up and sighs

The end of the LoS series is the GREATEST THING.
I liked that series >.>
Because that fuckup of a canon reset is OVER.
CANON RESET SUCKS
Hoenn was awful.

ANYWAY
Regardless of my disdain toward the LoS series.
don't want it to go down and disappear
Remake of RR, make Elora hot.

Anyway. I likewise don't want it to die.
Which is why I wanna help the Spyro wiki.
I need you guys to bring it back.

I turned it off for a while.

Why am I around?
Do I ever leave?
It's been four years since I killed SFA>

Recently, we along with several others launched NIWA.
An alliance of independent Nintendo-based wikis.
Stitch: did you know you can remove the chips after you put them in?
Yep.
/me wonders if that is significant
inb4 fail

in that order.
/me -_- would do it herself but i accidently clicked out of it..
/me thought the same, but there are 5 altogether.
93:2 and 3:11
