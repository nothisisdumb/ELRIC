I want to play but I can't find the server :(
Java: TALK TO ME
I got kicked to do that before :(
o.o
O.O
These voices...
Java: I don't know, I just want to play on the server, but i can't :(
You don't say?
The server is full.
Java: It did, but I can't find the server.
:(
Praise the Sun
haider.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. :)
Java: Why do that when I can try to play? :(

Pardon me as I go draw something~
Like, I know that Sandyd's is the name, but the server isn't public or something :(
I KNOW Java :OOO
Java: yet
maybe the server is friends only
I'm a silly pony~ :3
but it wasnt on the list then it wasnt full

/me headdesk multiple times
00,10this is why I replaced my damage sound effect in tf2
00,10also why I mute most players
it's like nails on a chalkboard
Lol.
I like the ding.

It's pretty bad
sooooo randoms? or bronystaters?

THERE, THAT'S A RULE
Ok. How many times have you been told to stop the canterlock. Multiple and yet you still don't do it~
*do it
Just follow the rules and you'll be fine~

If you don't
I can also reference memes. Fuck me right?
i didnt say fighting
Hehe :$ http://fav.me/d5gwcet
Neither am I! (read)[Let's go bro]
either way, he's annoying
I made that! XD
The Pony is my OC Navy Numbers XD
the controls are a pain and portals onlt make it worse
I just found a diaper store called "Poopee Whoopee"
Java: I just found a coffee shop called Java
I sitting on an island called Java
Java: I am drinking JAVA
Java: And my axe
Java: That's a fuckin' good milkshake
Java: Oh wait, we already did this, din't we?
yep
you should stop playing
But this time with my waifu :p
Java: Lunaismywaifu.
no, not derpy :(
great, I need an emoticon that doesn't show pony
<3
Not Fluttershy too!
Take that emotion
igh

I feel like TF2ing but I don't want to leave you beautiful people

mmmm cildhood obesity....
tastes like blood clots
No thank you
I wanna move to the UK
sapper
Java: Positive
my only problem is that I want to join the USAF
United States of America Force
thx
United States Air Force
why do you want to joing the air force if you hate america
mine was in the army and air force
^
Just watch and enjoy the damn show!
i think i wont leave it ever
Every era has its downside
^
its not just america thats going downhill
its the whole world
in the 50s there where no ponies
Living in the past does not solve the situation.
*better
its a lot harder getting in than out
I'M A MAN, AND I'M PROUD OF IT
>dubstep
not necessarily, but still. I hate the modern world as a whole
hmmm... yeah
Java can come too
people today blame the world and do nothing about it
Unless we can get a country to convert to ponyism I doubt the world can improve
they act as though its evil and has nothing to do with them
I AM AMERICAN. I AM AUTOMATICALLY LAZY.
but the world wont change on its own
bbl guys ^_^
hi all
*e
Running from the problem doesn't help you, it just makes it worse.

Java: AGAIN.
Not on guns?
Java: AND AGAIIIN
yep
Instead of complaining about the problems, we should be finding ways to fix them.
guns dont kill people, people dont kill people, loss of blood and damage to organs kills people
Blow shit up?
...yes, blow shit up
Assasinate dictators?
because games make you run amok -.-
Done that. Not effective
Declare war on the ocean?
it doesnt have to involve murder or destroying anything
welll more than vaguely but there is an quite of crowd here
Guys, it seems that Kotaku jumped the gun on accusing Fox News of playing the "murder simulators" card.
Geh Kotaku
Kill the hippies?
like i said, just set good morals for yourself and set an example for others, and help others with their lives and morals
^
The hive of scum and villainy
Tried that
and if someone doesnt behave like you want, you mustnt give up either, and keep going
Kotaku used to be good until Brian Crecente leave. Then it went to shit.
OH! I KNOW!! Kill all the profane rappers!!
Kotaku was always terrible
or we could censor everything
Off: do you hear this ping?
I prefer staying in Polygon for now
no
I'd wait until Kotaku officially retires before giving up on it.
00,02aww, no spots
Java: I don't go to Kotaku. I'm just usuing it as an example.
Fuck it, I don't even watn to play

Oh ok, I was able to track down the culprit. Turns out it was just a case of faulty wiring in the headset.
/me repeatedly punches his cat
To bad none of those guys have high five taunts :/
It's because it is rare to get in a crate or you have to pay £5 for it.

Yes, you should...cause I said goodnight to you
but... But... Where's everyone elese?
eh, idk
Tell them I wished them a good night.
Meh.
k
lol
night
huh? whazzat?
:p
it's noon here
/me squees
I haven't
I know
Java: neither have I
You replied tome
MURIKA never sleeps.
my foot is asleep, does that count?
along with a few others
Java nice pun there. And I wouldn't know :)
Yeah. That WOULD suck.
Damn that metal on metal clang is annoying.
no
Still it helps you see damage and if you hit someone
Anyway to lower the volume of the ping or change the sound entirely?
you can lower the stream volume
not sure
never really looked
I find it difficult to believe that TF2 is really popular if hitting enemies with bullets results in physical pain.
thats only if you have the ping selected
its avaliable to be turned off
I have to go sleepies :3
nighty
good night and all that jazz
yeah, you dont have to have the ping for damage, its only there for if you want to know if you hir something
until you hit a wall :p
/me grinds Java
Ponu up :)
-_-
Pony*
ponies up, mules down
face down, plot up
MvM
it's a pve system
I'm unfamiliar with "MvM"
as opposed to the normal pvp deathmatch thats in tf2
Mann
yeah
More fun that way?
excluding the training
Oh oh OH! The AI are all modeled after robots and unmanned vehicles. I see.
I can see why the ping would make sense then.
no..the pinging is for anything
I use the damage ping in any gamemode
http://daughter-of-fantasy.deviantart.com/art/Happy-Hearth-s-warming-eve-unicorns-342891788
damage ping is good, especially if you're running a sniper or engie
Allright then.
Yeah, The Ping is used to tell you if a weapon of yours is hitting someone, and to show how much damage is being done
Java: *shrug*

Cheer up lad
We're here for you Saturn. <3
08,01i've tried taking some HTP-5, hopefully it'll help
/me hugs Saturn.

05if you wish to watch :o
All da awesome music :3
Maybe I should use the name everyone knows me by
05fun fact
05this sabaton album
05goes through the history of sweden
05how it became an empire
05and how said empire ended
05in chronological order
05from first to last song
05aye
hai
when? o.o
05remember when we owned finland, denmark, norway and the balticum?
Oh yeah that
05during 1500 iirc
I'm not sure "conquering" our brothers would count as a Empire :p
More like...mi casa zu casa
500 years ago we would be at eachother throats.
Nowada ys...
We're all buddy buddy :D
05i woyuldnt mind norway denmark finland and island switched off EU and fromed the scandinavian union
Hail Scandiavia.
05then again
05but it would be nice
Yeah Norway is pretty safe where it is
In many cases safe economy and things
Except the latest mass killing of children...
That was Norway right?

yesterday
Oh boy here we go.
I like OCs when theyre drawn, Using pony creator is just.... no, lol
And a rainbow mane.
requesting to post non-picture material
And, of course, be an alicorn.
I wasn't expecting you to leave.
I like to use pony creator as a means to get together a color scheme and a basic design.
That's how I came up with my OC. Once I had the basic design down I drew it from there.
That's a lie, about five.
And not one shit was given.
Yup
05gotta get soem lunch
Well still it is a 2.5 thousand dollar computer.

i play it on high everything
<3 doing redstone
with 1GB RAM
only when redstone i cant play
au?
Doesn't require alot of anything. It just depends on several things.
Aha.
It's once you get more intensive into it you might require abit more of a system.
Fair 'nuff.
requesting to post non-picture material!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
omygod do i try"
anyone wanna see?

Mmmhmm
She is
Mmmhmm
Spitfir *drools*
She's just putting on the tough appearance for a flight instructor i guess
Problem is it seems like in the episode she had never met Rainbow Dash.
IKR?!
Ikr i thought that too
I said that exact same thing
She can't show favortism
Yeah, but she can at least agknowlage them
WAit
I didn't see anything odd about the way she acted. She was just being a drill sergeant.
Has it been 24 hours yet?
Just.
Like literally, by 2 minutes.
^
2 minutes ago
Flight squads usually are.
Seems like it
<_>
I see the Wonderbolts as like the Blue Angels here in the U.S.
Honestly I think they were looking for an excuse to do a Top Gun reference
6_9
Why, was there a Top Gun reference?
Rofl.
/me never saw that movie
Jaaaaymo~
I never saw Top Gun
The entire episode was a Top Gun reference
Not sure if it's an academy for the military or just the Wonderbolts, but in a way that influences cadets to join the military.
adorable
I heard of topgun. never seen it
I prefer the A-Team refrence in the Babs Seed episode
Top Gun's a good movie. I highly recommend it
And afterward, I recommend its parody. Hot Shots :D
Ughh.. i hate having to get upp :\
Isn't Top Gun just "jointheArmyjointheArmyjointheArmy" for a movie's length?
Air Force ≠ Army

If the recruits aren't up for the challenge, they are than presented the ability to go home, before they hurt themselves.

Derp.
theres a really clear shot
and then I blow all previous pics out of the air with this http://derpiboo.ru/183403
brb
not from the eop
ep*
kinda cheating
looks just like the one from yours
05thought it was a branch with "fire" leaves"
Hiyall
it looks like a flaming wing for me
hey everypony
whats going on
Haii
this song
is rather upbeat
not bad
bin awhile since I was on here
Hai
Catchy song by the way :)
ikr
CMC get on it!
wha?
hmmmmm
interesting idea
:)
I think i prefer cartmans version of this song
05dont ask me how i found these covers
i find littlekuribohs version of this song funnier xD
do like this one though
I don't think Spitfire's hot-headed, really. That's more a facade for the recruits. I can see her being very passionate about her job and duties though.
^
oh wow.... this cover
later
Can we have Dope's "You Spin Me Right Round" after this? XD
I think most of the peoblem here is people mistaking her on-duty attitude with her off-duty attitude.
Being a drill sergeant, she has to be all business.
o_O
wait
ck
WTF
Oooook, whatevs
And only kinda
umbarelllllla
http://derpiboo.ru/183403
Seriously, look at this

There may be a single BK spot in the UK

There's plenty of BK sports in the UK. I had one only the other day.
Do they have The Outback Steackhouse in Australia?
Steack?
How to engrish.
Steak
Yeah they do.
Do they have The Outback Steakhouse in Australia, or is it just called food over there?
They have 6 of them open, 7th to come.
Speaking fo which
Are there AMERICAN resuarants?
i lovemost of you
<:
American food
americans havnt really invented any foods
which induces muscle spasms
theyre all stolen, made with cheaper materials and sold on
except twinkies
Americans invented a heartattack on a bun
and youlet them die
Twinkies kill
actually....
You make me chuckle.
Anyway it was just a fantasy camp.... I think
There's that one company that's thinking about buying twinkies from Hostess
Yeah
TWINKIES ARE NOW MEXICAN FOOD
Mexican Twinkies?
:D
you americans are that screwed up, mexicans are saving the only thing you had going for you
/me is now prouder to be of mexican/hispanic descent
MEXICO

Wow wall of text didnt think it was that long
i'm mexican too :3

oh yeah, i generally prefer indian to english
05srsly the take out asian food was fantastic
05specialyl the thai
I LIKE FOOD
Asians know how to cook
no one in brittain ever actually eats brittish food
FOOD IS AWESOME
we just have it for the tourists
i
http://gabriev666.deviantart.com/art/Gothic-Metal-Chrysalis-343056997?
But the books say they do!
You know the most popular food in brittain
is an indian curry
08,01hmm
08,01i'm thinking of being a bastard
Hi Saturn
Saturn: go 4 it
although apparently the brittish versions are nothing compared to the indian
hello Saturn
Saturn: A Magnificient Bastard?
08,01and he's designed some hardware to go with it
Hi Saturn
08,01it's taken him months to design it and put it together
Saturn in VB?
he deserves everything bad that happens
thats the devils language
08,01i'm considering reversing his hardware and coding up my own software in python
08,01and then releasing it open source
do it in lua
08,01(he wants to distribute his as closed source shareware)
LD did not learn her lesson, that was the problem
Saturn, does he need the money?
nothing wrong with shareware
08,01RainbowAsh: yeah, kinda; but i'm not convinced there's a market for it
08,01i'd just be doing it for the fun of reversing it
05Saturn
05check stream
That was over getting kicked out
08,01so i'll probably not be a bastard
Saturn: can we see it
08,01texasboykc09: unfortunately not; he's not released it for distribution yet
nice picture
08,01and i don't have it installed currently
I just want LD to be a RD rival
08,01Wrek: oh wow
05also
05love this song
05punkadelica
i hope not
ld*
GOTTA GO BYE
to much contravusy
05it was awesome
I know this song by heart
this music
i meen ofcorse i want them to
<3 This song <3
I would bet there is a fic of LDxRD
As in the Year set back thing.
looks like Sai
Imagine if LD finds the jealousy that possesed Luna
They seem to be military like.
hiya
yeah
That's waht I thought
what*
They also seem to a sports team, they race other teams and such
Cuz the Blue Angels are a legit military force, but they're also known for their air shows.
I second the notion of the Blue Angels.
The Blue Angels are the best pilots in the Air Force
Blue Angels = Navy
I can see wanting to be part of the best fliers in Equestria
gah
all this music
you're thinking of the Thunderbirds which are Air Force
and its feeeels
Oh yeah! That's right. Blue Angels are navy!
They're the navy's fighter pilots
As a Navy brat
wonderbolts*
i do a smashing rendition of blue moon
Whats on?

Actually the 80s were 3 decades ago. :P

is this GIMP?
He is using Paint Tool Sai
Sai is more friendly when it comes to vectoring
it feel diffrent to see spitfrire without her wonderbold suit on
spitfire*
*ikr
thats not good
lol
guess i got to used to seeing her i her wonderbolt suit
in*
Oddly I was epecting at least one Battle of Britain referrence in the last episode. Sadly none :(
Hi guys!
oh right the 24 hour rule has passed for the episode
:>
I guess its time equestria had an epic pony war...
okay i'm back
:>
http://i.minus.com/il2Vy4c3OfmLX.gif

Equestria has an army? all ive seen was the princesses guards

To keep the Zebras and Saddle arabians out I assume.

05the pegasi are the most millitant
Oh wow it is 4:03am XD I am ment to wake up in 4 hours.

I think we have all come to an acceptance that ponies are really rascist
They are the Spartans of Equestria
no?$
bai*
Bah, If the Buffalo really wanted that land they would have planted apple trees themselvs.
oka
y
http://i.imgur.com/usEWl.gif
the buffalo was there first. then the settler took that land form them.
*they
I remember seeing some where that the land of Equestria is actually made to look like Pony Island or something like that.
05...
Perhaps hostile wild pony tribes would be interesting
more like 7 I think
Dang, drawing isn't as easy as I thought it would be
05this sogn is epic
ooh serj
not heard him in a while
But the picture would be poor
I would like to see dragons in this show that arnt jerks, other than spike.
*poorly made
maybe characters from On a Cross and Arrow?
or humans?
My guess is that there many species of Dragons, there are ones that migrate, ones that sleep for 1000 years, etc.
05gona finnish anneli's request tomorrow probably
Males migrate and stay out all night, females actually do shit and build cities :D
05then gona start on libmans
05but for now
