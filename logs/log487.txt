Om: I'll try...? 0_0
do you have a d100?
a set for D&D
The_Pony_Guy: I'll be the one in the blue hat.
16-sided? lol
d100s are a pain.
d4, d8, d10, d12, d20
Anyway,bye for real now :)
What is going on?
WallDives: im lucky then...only child ;p
2d10 is much saner
Just to let everypony know when I type *snaps* like that that's whenyou've lost me. :)
TheRandomkid321: buffer show, behold it's magic and tremble
no stream?
but pulling out a large d100 is hilarious. we call it the golf ball.
TheRandomkid321: Nope.
its my favorite show. I'm waiting for the repeat of episode 3187, that one always cracks me up
IKR
WallDives: true, I have to conceed that one.
KiwiBoi777 Is that a long term name MahBoi?
that and we havent used it since we tried to play FATAL.
but then there's always the "ok, it finally stopped rolling, and stayed on the table.... uh... what number did it come up with?"
TheRandomkid321: nope, I am still mah boi
also, D&D NEXT (aka 5.0 iirc) is a shiny AD&D.
lol
what would you need a d100 for other than a ridiculous percentile die
hmm... pony D&D....
I'm still trying to work out a pokemon D&D...
You need a d100, because it has 100 sides.
XD
Cher3ry they have that

OCs are too mainstream for me.
^
Because I've been known to go INSANE! :p
but insanity isnt self aware...
if u know ur insane, ur not really insane
Where is Alicorn_Prince_Shane anyways?
dunno
Insanity is like a catch-22. infact, it IS the catch-22.
Well, insanity is simply the state of being seriously mentally ill.
and Alicorn_Prince_Shane said he was gone, and thats it.
WallDives: Strange. It says he's still here
he said he was going afk.
WallDives: He did dat last night to.
Im off to go leech money off the government for being a useless twat. BRB <3
IS IT ZOMBIE'S! :O

Darkts3|MLG: :D well i was trying to "spark" it up in here
I object, for the sake of objection.
for I has no favorite mane pony, and next to no one knows my favorite background pony either.
WallDives: so... all ponies are best pony to you :D
more like they all have endearing traits and they all do things that would make me backhand them.
/me wakes up and pokes panda's plot
so, -2+2.
/me falls back asleep
O_O
so your typical woman walldives?
is something I do not care to discuss.
02There’s a lot of legit looking fake trailers online right now
02some admit they're fake, others don't
i dont like discussing after backhanding either, seems redundant
besides, I dont outright hate any pony.
02brb
04I saw the Halo 4 trailer

OMFG so many games......so little money
incoming text wall to discuss
The Hub has confirmed picking up My Little Pony for its summer 2012 lineup. The Hub has placed an order for thirteen episodes, with writers Meghan McCarthy, Cindy Morrow, M.A. Larson and Dave Polsky returning to the show, and story editor for the first and second seasons Rob Renzetti replaced by Meghan McCarthy. McCarthy has been called "showrunner" in an April 2012 article in the online edition of the L.A. Times.
?
ooooooooooooooooooooooook
dishwasher_EXTREME Binding of Isaac and Bastion
13?!
most of the awesome storywriters are still there
:D
?
huh.
but... no ms. Amy?
so many games are coming out WOO HOO!!!!
04Vordox?
i have no idea what is going on right now :L
Ghosties: You know we spoke of tai Fu and such before, right?
Do you remember the SHAPE of the Evil villian in the First Kung Fu Panda game. DIDN'T that strike you rather...
Princess_Cadence is has been a very long time since i last saw you......
i know..
04I never played the first Kung Fu Panda game :p
No, I meant the movie =P
game base on movies in my view are never good
dishwasher_EXTREME: True, but there are exceptions.
see ya later
agreed
bck to the future
Lord of the Rings for the games was prrtty decent
the new one
04Right, Tai Lung
(Not the MMO but the single player ones)
by Telltale
04Who is a tiger
Ghosties: And rather "spikey" but not the same
ok back to thr future is good
BUt what if Tai Fu was the father? :p
dear god
THAT STRETCH
04Getting into fanfic territory now, Vordox
no stream ?
Derp.
dishwasher_EXTREME: No stream, I wish I could hijack it but...meh
you mean slashfic
cant wait to play assassin's creed 3 and and halo 4
04I'm sure there's zero continuity or connection between Tai Fu and Kung Fu Panda, but there's no denying that there certainly is a similarity and perhaps a foundation for Kung Fu Panda within Tai Fu
dishwasher_EXTREME: Not buying them
wait...what? Vinyl_Scratch VinylScratch and Vynil_Scratch?? wat.
why?
I want to play Grand Theft Assasin's Creed
Ghosties: I need to replay the game to get the better image of this. ><
I mean Watchdog
Life_Essence that would be cool
:D thats so true
My buys = Rayman Legends, Last of Us, Lara Croft, And MAAAAYBE Watch Dogs. :P
so......this is weird
Think about it
Lara Croft gets MORE BRUISED THEN F*CKING KRATOS
Lara > Kratos
so...am I the only one that got a 2006 E3 vibe from this year?
sequals only?
thats normal for E3
ill buy halo; assassin's creed;black ops
Not only sequels
valoreins|Work why only 13 episodes
dunno im not working there lol
the new black ops seems cool but i wish they would mix the gameplay a little bit more ..
what? COD change gameplay? BLASPHEMY
bf3 is best shooter
running around shooting things tens to get bored
COD: Map Pack 5
tends
i'll be back soon i promised my grandparents i'd help with something
they got a jet plane there.. but you manuver it like a helicopter..
wonder what the elder scroll 6 would be like
nah much easier than a heli
04Buys from E3: Assassin's Creed III, The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, and definitely Watch Dogs and maaaaaaaaaybe Beyond
The Hub reported that "Hearts and Hooves Day", an episode on the theme of Valentine's Day, which aired on February 11, 2012, in the middle of the second season, was the show's most-viewed episode ever, and the second highest of any program of the Hub network; its viewership exceeded 150% of that of the previous year
XD
i know
I'm waiting for Square Enix to make Final Installment and Final Installment 2
where will the elder scroll 6 be at?

Dovakhin: lol
I'm usually not interested in songs unless they're either dubstep or drum&bass

Lil_B: in fact, Jennidash. whom drew my oc. is drawing both her oc and mine together in a pic. that way in someway we can be together lol
:[
00,02Vordox, but... it looks so side scroller
Dovakhin: We only tend to broadcast ponies at the weekend, that way, it doesn't get bland and boring over thr week
Phase4 What is the name of this band?
/me 00,02is not that fond of side scrollers
Phase4: That's what it is... :P
Lil_B: saras not jennidash
My nick is "imgur" so whenever somepony posts a link to an image on reddit, I'll be pinged.
Dovakhin: Come back during movie night if you want to watch ponies, otherwise shuddup and watch :(
00,02Scarlet, miracle of sound
Oh, Iji was a classic
Phase4: Bah you never know until you try! It's a simple game. BUT if you want good classic 3D...
DOOM!
No
WOLFENSTEIN
VioletGreySha: u there?

Binding of Isaac
14dammit 7 stop crashing for no reason <.<
14I miss the BSOD
Dovakhin: nooo. your game produced lame ass memes
Weekday morning ponies in 2 1/2 hours. Showing today: Feeling Pinkie Keen and Sonic Rainboom.
14the worst part is that's STILL better than Vista
00,02i'm VERY pickie with anything involving shooting
Bronysith I just said that I didn't say, that saras is jennidash, somebody else said that
Dovakhin: Nope, it's true, though we do a few , but mainly games and such
00,02so much so that tf2 is the only game i regularly play that has it
Bronysith: you are stupid
Lil_B: o right. i just wanted to clarify lol
Phase4: Jeebus dude... :P
Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb :3
Phase4: You're missing alot of stuff. :(
Dungeons of Dredmore
00,02Vordox, it just doesnt interest me that much
Dungeons of Dredmor is AWESOME
00,02i'ma thinking man
Legend of Grimrock
00,02hence my aim sucks :P
Phase4: Play zelda then
Dovakhin: wat? bethesda is lame. fallout 3 was their last good game. New vegas was pretty good too. skyrim was incredibly bad
everyone should play Dungeon Defenders
00,02Very_Silly_Filly, i do
Thinking? Try 2D puzzles then
This post will appear on the stream in 10 seconds.
/me is playing Bioshock 2 right now, which is a shooter

Ghosties: HIYA

d3rb: 37 uploaded
ie 1, 2 and brotherhood
37%*
Bronysith i would NEVER question anybody just because he likes something or someone, I'm happy for you
00,02fallout is another one i might try
OR BETTER YET! If you LOVE Thinking Try out POint and CLick, like Broken Sword.
14http://www.tgdaily.com/mobility-features/63829-mobile-tactile-tech-gets-physical
'dat sudden Ghosties update
00,02downloaded new vegas a year or so ago
nice, let me know when its done [wklmeb]JRP2234
I'm with you, Phase4...I'm prefer games with much more of a mental edge to them instead of twitch reflexes.
Hi :D
00,02ended up in the second town, everyone was after me
hello Rainbow.
new vegas is still a shooter
fallout 1 and 2 and turn based
Lil_B: ty man. i mean i never even had a girlfriend before so its kinda nice. even though shes in california and im in georgia
tiem to think
00,02Life_Essence, but its not just a shooter
00,02you can do other stuff
PONIPONIPONI
true
Hey Phase4, I still think you should try out QUBE sometime
00,02contrast this to cod
oh hold on a sec i need to change my name cause it only says rainbow
8 seconds. Not bad.
Phase4: I made everyone hate me and then no matter where I went I was being killed
I'd reccomend fallout 1 and 2, they are isometric point and click adventures
00,02pony_7763, tried it a while ago,
and I suppose you can supplement your bad shooting with VATS
Phase4: I had my PC in the lounge today so I tried to play CoD4 on the big TV. oh fuck my eyes.
00,02found it fun but i'm pressed for cash
How do people play shooters on TVs?
HAI PHASE <-- THIS IS COOLZ http://2.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/13/55/0c54bae4dad36cd8329323d47a10d060.jpg

Oh, phase4, I heard that sometime bronystate played the math song that I posted a long time ago
just like my boyfriend
time for some simeltaneous differential equations
and > prevents screen scratch design flaw
;D
Phase4: If you love Thinking, try out Point and Click games, like Broken Sword, or Puzzle horro games, ala Silent hill or something =P
00,02lets see how tf2 goes
/me hugs Lil_B Twi_Fi and Bronysith :D
I love maths!

Lil_B: oh ok
*ATAN
00,02Life_Essence, whats your work?
Very_Silly_Filly: Your opinion, and I respect that. They have their downsides. To me, those 2 games are mostly boredom killers.

Phase4: Can you PM me the server if you don't mind?
RainbowDash, you and him are the same person. quit playing.

VioletGreySha: Should I PM the details now, or wait until I'm next on the list?
Magical_pab|Lunch: Why is that? :P
Ninjazz: dammit!
Therefore, if everyone with The HUB were to tune in during the marathon, and then all change off upon Derpy being censored, it might send a message that we don't like the cen... then again, I kind of accept the reasoning behind that.
I'm not Meanwhile. :D
Ninjazz: :O
Ninjazz: i know sorry!
Whos Meanwhile :P
derp
Twi_Fi: just pm me and send it dosnt mether when you do it ^^

Ninjazz: I HAVE NO IDEA!

Lemme get you the IP.

o woah
I'm gonna play some league of legends. I'll be back in an hour or so
Nya
Okay. Thanks, but the "if I may" hasn't really been settled. I got some bad blood on my permanent record right now.
I see Sith is still talking about the parade.
Ninjazz: ikr? btw sorry again. i'm really tired :D
Maybe if I stick to playing Medic, and never switch off the Medigun.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
It's fine, Magical_pablez94. I was surprised that someone would write about me atfirst. :$
func_precipitation is best entity
Ninjazz: Waitwhat
Ninjazz: well sooner or later someone will :D maybe i will.:D
XAX: RAWRity got that Meanwhile X Trixie fic out. :D
Magical_pablez94: I doubt that. :$
Ninjazz: Ololololol
XAX: Want a link?
Ninjazz: who knows!
Meh sure
Hi
TWALAHT SPARKOL!
14how are you? :3
Magical_pablez94: Ah, well. If anything, its probably going to be about something I'd rather not be written about. :$
Bleh x.x
Ninjazz: ...never say never Role Playing will conquer the whole world sooner or later !
I know this makes me sound like a noob and adds another black mark on my permanent record. But where do I put that IP address?
Hmmm.
Okay. So I'm a noob for not knowing where to put in the IP address.
Ninjazz: I was expecting a whole story
I can only see the image on my iPod
No. No. No, Kandarihu. It does not.
XAX: I'll hold the link for you.
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/9684/dueling-analogs-all-geared-up-and-raring-to-go <--- THIS PISSES ME OFF SO MUUUCH!
Kandarihu: You put it in... the box.... which says... someone help me...
<- lolded
SEE
...
Hi bronystate.
Not even I know how to do it apparently. 6_9
Hey FillyFlam!
heyooo
Hmm, okay.
:L<
Ninjazz: take IP, and paste in BOX, A CARDBOARD BOX!
What's the server name?
^
Pony Fortress 2...
*fuckyea*
:P
Pony Fortress 2: Fillydelphia [MLP Herous]
heroes*
L?
Ninjazz, you on it?
Nope. But I do have the server info.
Okay. I see that. Thanks
Ninjazz: try joining...
/me yawns
SO MUCH DOWNLOAD stoof
Anytime, Kandarihu. :)
I don't really feel like playing. :S
just saw one that said... FOREVER!!!
Ninjazz: thats ok :P
oh TF2 streaming now :D
Oh dear. I have only until now to play, after which I gotta go.
DOUBLE FUN
Have fun then, Kandarihu.
hello everypony.
But if Phase4 always comes to this server, I guess I can favorite it.
Ninjazz: watch out for me in the stream :D
9:05 am EST/8:05 am CST/6:05 am PST.
Better yet, Kandarihu, add him.
Hey, teel me what you think guys. http://derpy.me/CGs7U
Ninjazz: thing is there seems to be a TON of stuff needed to download...
Ninjazz: for the server :P
I have to be VERY careful about that. Permanent hot water, after all.
Indeed... That's probably a good reason why I don't want to join.
Ninjazz: ok then...
What do you mean by that, Kandarihu? :S
:v
Permanant hot water
wut?
HMLLLLLLLLLL
why are there so much OCs having dark body and red mane..?
Looks good, Scarlet. Is that a wall paper?
Eww, magic and friendship
OMG mint
some <censored> hit my server with a 400GB attack
Please do not swear. You have sworn 30 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
is so funny lag
just curious :s
Just saw trixie rage XD
Yeah, Ninjazz
I accidentally left traffic logging on last night
not long to join now...
when the CPU/GPU is set to power saving mode
:D
Nice.
Nice job Scarlet.
and the disk IO was too much
so it went into read-only
:C
and I tried to reboot
Thanks:)
but apparently the filesystem is also <censored> up
Did it break?
Please do not swear. You have sworn 31 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
:<
you could rebuild it
;P
Dat Motorbikes...
apparently
"I would like to let you know that the server does not boot because it is
unable to locate the root partition by UUID and drops into initramfs."
04I'm heading to bed, see you all later :)
Scarlet watch me :D
bai Ghosties
I have no idea how that happened
Night Ghosties
Night Ghosties! Take care! :)
I think I will
bye Ghosties
Ghosties: weh iz u live?
since I haven't had much experience in fixing this
> Changing UUIDs
and I'm a bit short on time
What a paintrain
yeah
UUIDs are terrible
I might check grub and see if anything happened there
Why can't it just do the /sda1234
I tried mounting
there hes gon

/me attacks Sylandest with hugs
Well, do you need to make any backups of your server?
aaand I walk in to see Ninjazz get his plot poked :D
VioletGreySha: anyone from Bstate?
:$
/me returns Ninjazz's hug
ohai Sylandest
People like my plot apparently. :$
howdy, Alicorn_Prince_Shane! How are you today?
To be honest, i made my OC around the name Scarlet
Princess_Molestia: 1 a is enough :P
Sylandest: good
So the black kinda just fit.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: yah
1 what?
Ninjazz: at least VioletGreySha does, lol
Yeah, well. One is enough. :$
Bahahaha
I said "how" on 9:11
As in 911
Call for help
How can I help
X3
;3
hehehe
yah i made his plot shiney
I do, HML
which I should be able to do from rescue
once the stupid mounting works
Nice.
hi:$
it's mainly the BNC stuff honestly
the rest are just IRCds and such
dat Sarah name change xD
nothing I can't easily redo
Oh hello, rainbow.
hay rainbow
howdy, rainbow!
wow that is sad
I got past all the school's blocking
I wish I had a dedicated room to recording
by using googledns
Anypony still have school?
LOLWHAT
I wish my school was that easy
Night :D All :P Airpuff Twi_Fi and rest of Bstate :P :P:
Gnight, Shane. :)
BRB!
My tech guys know about tech to an extent
This is a problem
As in my school's tech guys btw
night, Alicorn_Prince_Shane! take care
GOING TO BUY MY WII AND RHYTHM HEAVEN FEVER!
That was fun
so excited!
/me jumps into his bed at the speed of light
Vordox: have fun
pinkie told me to get out more... BUT I HAVE WORK!
my tech guys are awesome but annoyingly knowledgeable
I've hacked into the wireless
but nothing else yet
the fun has been DOUBLED
have you tried googleDNS?
xD
though I figured it was DNS blocking
imgur I still have school until July
ACS13123: yup
0,5Mornin'
morning LordCelestia
y'know why mah nick is "imgur"?
mine isn't DNS blocking
I use a local DNS server usually
so that'd bypass everything
if it was DNS
I have to use a proxy before connecting to the internet
and school DNS servers
So, what do the do for blocking?
is my chat dead?
whitelist
Ohey, LordCelestia!
You'll be able to beat it one day
Oh nooo
;-;
I've tried
it's very hard
You could get a job
Is it because of the website, imgur?
and a 3G modem
I've beaten it in the past
and use that at school
:s
but they figured out the methods and blocked it
lolouch
so atm I only have a really crap web proxy
that only works for about 10% or less of sites
of course
I could get a teacher's login
which isn't hard
Lil_B: no, we're just all waking up or tired, lol
and I'd be happy with that since barely anything is blocked there
they use blacklist instead of whitelist
and they don't do portblocking
YES. And it's relation to reddit. Was insplred when my nick yesterday was "twentypercentcooler", and every time someone posted a link to that site, I was pinged.
Or off doing something else. :D
Heh. :D
Sylandest yeah, the chat has been a lottle bit slow since the E3 livestreams XD
ourschool
Blocks all the ports
Lil_B: we're all tired from it, lol. So many games..and also so many "noooooo"s, lol
of course
except HTTPS and 80
:|
*turns on bedroom light* and twi is still staring down apon me
:l
Well, you could try to do ophcrack on a teacher PC one day xD
D:
I could infect every single computer with a keylogger
The only problem with ophcracking here is > Network passwords
I don't need ophcrack
who does when you have a keylogger?
I'd just konboot
XAX: isn't that a good thing? lol
LOL
U bad haxor
get into the local admin account
Dat Smile <3
awww
and then install keyloggers that spread via usb
yay!
XAX: Not if you know what he has to see everytime he does. :D
???
PROFIT
of course, there's the issue of C&Cs
I mean, Sylandest. 6_9
but I could just have it save the stuff on the computers locally
hehehe
but then I'd be at risk
Yay ownernname?
well, I off too then, see you later people
tho
Cya Lil_B! Take care.
See ya Lil_B
laters, Lil_B!
You can frame somebody
/me hugs Ninjazz Twi_Fi and Sylandest
:)
alternatively I could set it so that it logs stuff that's typed into the winlogon process
/me looks for a friend to talk to :3
oh bai Lil_B
and if it's a successful audit it'll save to its files
Always one here for ya, Gunthler. :D
and then I'll have it so it's easy to delete logs
Yay
everypony here is talkable, right..?
hidden file on a network drive?:
I must be in a happy mood or something. :$
not network drive
Sure.
local
Most times, I am. :$
it's easy to tell if teachers are there
Hey, no complaints here, Ninjazz
A happy pony is a happy pony
Right now I'm playing RuneScape and I'm getting bored :D
guys look at this... http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-untitled1.png
valoreins|Work: I am told I talk very much, yes
it's also fun cus' our school doesn't have cameras
just motion sensor
s
mm hmm
because of privacy issues
most of the schools here have cameras lol
like if someone was changing in front of the camera
/me is waiting for CrazyCherry
;D
guys
guys
but yeah
There are no cameras in the bathrooms thou
gh
tbh keyloggers are far more simplistic than bruteforcing
valoreins|Work: that pic...scary...but true XD
how could a shy and sensitive pony like Fluttershy could embrace the cycle of life?
TEH CIRCLE OF LIFE
Ah well. Fish are food. Not friends. :D
It's always the silent ones...
How'd you code it
valoreins|Work: fish are fish. I eat fish all the time. They are most delicious
INB4 Crappy directinput
What does the internet think about ponies, today? :D
I DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING CELESTIA!
:P
i just got killed
alot
valoreins|Work: I'm sure somepony like fluttershy has learned that early on and is used to it by now
Gunthler: It still loves it
Great! :D
That....
wut?
hmm
Reminds me of Adventure Time.
Give us more maths!

Did someone say function?
00,02holy crap that stream looks bad

^
WTF?

I just remembered that I can figure that out.
In 8 seconds, this comment will appear on the stream.

if you fail, you failed
the results aren't always the most important thing

Wrek: Duuuude....that "stroke" there is very very...

Strokey overbound. :P
/me fans Sylandest's face
Wrek dat whip O__o
Vordox: Lets keep it at maybe. :D
Ninjazz: what happened? All I remember is AJ
I like the touch of applejuice going on around her... ya know. :$
Who wants to use some bath sal... I mean zombiu and get zombified!?
Ninjazz this music makes people masturbate:D
Damn this smooth jazz....
Ninjazz: aaaaand there goes my brain
Where's d3rb pissed off to
Ninjazz: indeed.. smoothin my brains out
Aaand...I dislike the picture for what it is, but quality wise it's one of Wrek's best... DAT PARADOX
/me has been laughing this entire time at Sylandest's expence.
:D
Wrek tends to do that to ponies, Vordox. :D
Ninjazz: I feel absolutely no shame here :D slight embarassment, maybe, but otherwise I'm happy :$
Ninjazz: I don't think I've seen anyone of it being R34 =P
Sylandest: ... you've been tainted..
Vordox: Wrek's talent non the less.
...
Airpuff: if this is what its like being tainted, I am perfectly ok with this
Vordox, who?
Sylandest: Welcome to my world :D
CrimsonPhoenix: The AJ picture, it's R34. :P
where?
or..."it became"
Airpuff: huzzah! The tainted ones have been doubled!
Wreky's DA
Sylandest: indeed :D
oh my~
now that's juicy
CrimsonPhoenix: eeyup :$
face look odd though
I'm disliking it, big time. D:
/me now has trigger reaction to the word "juicy" :$
Oh shush Vordox
CrimsonPhoenix: You're not an AJ FAN! =P
You're welcome, Sylandest. :D
Vordox: .. I am :D
you can just erase that line and BAM Sfw
Vordox: I am a major AJ fan, lol
LOVE,Y U SO COMPLEX!?
Ninjazz: *squee* :$
yay
Wrek|Dusty: dat picture is... "bueno"
also I am a fan of Rarity and I follow lil miss rarity tumblr
Bronysith: Agree. :D
as a fan of the proper character that is AJ, I find the image revolting, HIGHLY revolting. ._.
by the way, Ninjazz, where did you find this music? It's actually rather good
And I say that with the basis of who she has been and who she is in the MLP
I see you're still one of the good ones, Vordox.
Gosh
hi bronystate :)
Vordox: .. who know.. might be she's like that..
:D
Sylandest: YouTube is a treasure trove. :)
morning, derpy_pony
Ninjazz: indeed it is, lol
Hey derpy_pony!
morning derpy_pony
Airpuff: we never do see what happens when the cameras go off...:D
16:14 here ^^
Sylandest: I actually found it when I was looking for Portal 2's jazz song. :$
but...morning
Airpuff: According to her whole biography based on the MLP Show...no =P
Sylandest: .. indeed..
Ninjazz: haha, but it works! It's actually really good
Vordox: who knows.. If you had written a biography.. would you mention.. it ALL? :D
youtube has a few pearls, yes
Oh Vordox seriously
There's 34 of everything
Doesn't mean it's acceptable, CrimsonPhoenix
Don't mix those up
Just accept it and move on
hello?
it's inevitable
It's the internet, Vordox.
Invetible?
Eyup.
No wonder the world is going to shit if that happens
yes R34 is inevitable
and now that the music has stopped, imma get me some breakfast
Have fun World, you're screwed.
be happy it's only 34...you don't wanna know what the japanese did with the material
Doesn't mean you have to look for it, Vordox. :P
Vordox: you pressed the link... :D
Oh boy Vordox
You would manage to last 10 second in /d/
wouldn't**
I've been one of the supervisors of Internet since BEFORE it was released in common hands CrimsonPhoenix
Don't tempt me
/d/?
I admire Vordox actually. So few ponies who actually care about canon and actual morals of the show.
Whats that?
the internet belongs to us now...live with it
That some big position you claim to be
Why do you think I admire the ideal of Love and Tolerate.
"just cause"?
/me yawns.
Before it was just a weapon for anti trolling? :S
oh, I just had an idea!
something to pass the time for everypony and give us something to do
/me gives CrazyCherry some coffe
coffe*
Rubbish
I think he already knows that... :S
Ninjazz: I don't drink coffee.
CrazyCherry: tea, perhaps? *holds up glass of said drink*
/me takes back the coffee and offers CrazyCherry tea instead
Back off, Sylandest. :D
Airpuff: I said, as a artform of what Wrek talent is, I like it, I just don't like the content. =P
I was here first! :D
You sure about that? :P
....damn you and your time powers
Vordox: yeah, but some people enjoy the content too, i see your case, but we already know the problems behind it
:3
Ninjazz: Sure! :)
/me gives CrazyCherry some delicious tea
06relieved :3~~~~
Ninjazz: mee tooo!!!!
If coffee ain't the answer, tea is.
Ninjazz: Thanks!
well, fine, I'll just drink my tea myself...nopony wants my tea anyway *huffs*
/me gives Airpuff some delicious tea
/me sips on the tea.
Airpuff: I'm just not liking the idea where the boundaries of what is acceptable keeps diminishing, it'caused havoc in our world far too many times, and repeating the same occasion again, wether real or digital, it'll happen again.
cruel world
I appear to be out of tea... None for me.. :S
Damit
agh, im supposed to be getting food
Mmmmh I believe we need to stop before we realize that we're looping the argument
And that's where the world is going, total accepting to whatever that is...
/me offers Ninjazz his tea
Is there a stream
That vision alone scares the Jeebus out of me.
/me takes Sylandest's offer and drinks it heartily
:3
Thanks, my friend. :)
Ninjazz: huzzah, I'm useful!
you're welcome :)
Vordox: fighting the sunset might not be less wise...just accept it...that how humans are, always were, always will be
+s
Vordox: There are boundaries, clear boundaries, but if you enter a certain part of the internett, they are changed. I dont really see anything wrong with the picture, other than it is pornographic, which is considered a taboo no matter what you say. Pony or human, dosent matter.
and everypony? I have an idea to give us something to do while we wait for stream to live again, if anypony's interested
I'm really liking that Vordox isn't one of the fucked up people on the internet.
Sylandest: Shoot.
Ninjazz: find a song that you feel describes you or a part of you. Got the idea after listening to your jazz music, hehe
;3
I haven't even seen said pic. Link plox?
*sniff**sob*
Airpuff: full freedom of speech.
Vordox: indeed.
That is what the internet stand for.
I'll throw mine out for a start: Jamiroquai, Virtual Insanity
And some freedom is fecked up =P
TrixieBaconMuffin: whats the matter? *hugs*
I'll pm you it, derpy_pony. It's kinda inappropriate. :$
haha, thx :)
i diced onions
Vordox: and what one conciders fucked up is diffrent from person to person.. :s
TrixieBaconMuffin: haha :D
00,02RAGE
00,02everything breaks on me
00,02:(
Phase4: whats up?
Airpuff: As AJ said. "Eeeyuup"
/me hugs Phase4
Vordox: AJ says "Eeeyuup"? :s
Vordox: only remember Big mac' sayin that
Airpuff: Season 2, CMC doing the Gabby Gums part
Where Mac got angry and AJ
asdf
Vordox: Aaah! now i remember it! :D
HI L_L
You all want to know something fun?
Something most people haven't noticed
Fuck u Telstra
Bonbon and Lyra MAY be great friends in the MLP show.
Just fuck off please
Sure it's a speculatio but...
Ugh I'm so mad
Indeed, Vordox. That ticks me off too.
Just because they are in the same scene together doesn't make them lovers.
I mean... sure.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas <--- Look here, at 2:17
Shipping.
LOOK AT IT!
I WANT ALL OF YOU TO LOOK AT IT!!!!
Anyway, enough analyzing the MLP...
Back to spriting and ignore the world some more. :P
00,02stupid modem
/me 00,02grumble grumble grumble
Ninjazz: Saw it? :P
saw what?
Phase4: did you ever try to turn it off an on? :D
00,02Airpuff, i did
00,02did bugger all
Yes, I did.
Yankee: The 2:16-17 of that Video
Phase4: :D
Same sync, same animation, same emotion.
They were hopping together.
You sure anyone could do that? :p
Goodnight everypony!
00,02either the modem is dying or internode were doing maintinance, which is likely considering the time
Eeeyup Ninjazz
00,02night Twi_Fi
Night Twi_Fi
Gnight, Twi_Fi! Take care!
But what does that mean? :S
Ninjazz: Would you walk in sync with random strangers? :P
Night Twi_Fi
Twi_Fi: may the force be with you
Night Twi_Fi :P
ok now im back anything interesting tha i should know when im gone
G'night Twi_Fi!!!
Nope. But this is Pinkie Pie doing a parade here.:D
where?
Ninjazz: True, but coincidence? Don't think si
So
It's TOO specific to be "Coincidence"
The team have stated that they were put together cause the look good together.
weird
Isn't that still a matter of opinion?
I love !!! LOVE !!! moist towelettes
Ninjazz: See? :P
they feel so GLORIOUS upon my sweet ass
dishwasher_EXTREME: ... wat.. :D
I have returned with cereal, everypony. Whats going on now?
Indeed.
Sylandest: Wb :)
Airpuff: tyty :)
Sylandest moist towlettes
:why:
dishwasher_EXTREME: and how much you enjoy them upon your allegedly sweet ass? :D
Ninjazz: And you think that's the ONLY time they had a "Involvement" with eachother?
But that's just how ANY fandom works, Vordox. As much as I hate crack pairing, this one has certain potential even if it just that. :S
Just a sec.
they make me feel clean
17:25 - fighting with Lyra over Smarty Pants, <--
07:13 - Seen talking to Lyra by the well as Spike walks passed them. She and Lyra are then startled by Derpy.
?
Wait... What are you getting at, Vordox? :S
SPOON
GHOST
I have no idea whats going on in this chat :s
dishwasher_EXTREME lyra and bon bon.
the ghost that kills with a spoon
Ninjazz: They got close together due to the fandom
Airpuff: I am eating cereal. Thats what I'm doing
But not many have noticed it
Its lyra and bon bon everyone. stay caaalm
Sylandest: ... Awesome.. :D

I hate it when the stream randmoly starts...
lol
And what the fuck is this
how come Lambo
If it's Eddie Izzard, no thanks.
05Lambo it was announced
I was wondering where the sound was coming from. :3
alexxm: Listening to great music -> boom
what u playing sb64
05so not random
I hate it when it buffers every 5 minutes :c
-_-
05Kandarihu: jsut mute and stfu then
did you ever see gabriel iglasias?
hes funny and hes on netflix
Wrek|Dusty: Love and tolerate
Kandarihu what don't you like about him
Wrek|Dusty: Well, I pressed on the pause button thingy when I loaded this site. And I am one of those people who has got hundreds of tabs open... Well, nevermind
05Shimmer: seeing how often he complains, he's had enough tolerance
I can't understand a word he's saying.
I can
Yes you can.
umad
finally, no more buffering :D
Yeah you're right, I can.
Is he wearing that all the time?
lol
eeyyyyy
All of this just darkens the atmophere around here. I'm not hating on him personally. The guy's confused and he's been taught to take pride in that.
he looks gay
good afternoon, im a bit of a bastard
XD
I'm a bastard.
This guy's funny.
05pony_653: as do you but we aint complaining
pony_996: you spelled sexy wrong
wat?
Eversince I knew Louis CK I found all other comedians not funny
"Ey" is he canadian?
What's wrong with being gay pony_996?
Kandarihu: Since when was it wrong taking pride in who you are? Imo people can learn something from the guy
*Eh
nothing
Lambo: Anything wrong with saying hello, eh?
Dammit, I meant et
canadian eh?
GAHH. Can't type today
:I
Is it wrong to be proud of being addicted to drugs?
no
Ah, well, don't find him funny. Back to Photoshop
rofl, altar boy
never say never... to drugs
Okay. Sounds like you aren't being serious.
If you are British, you will most likely find this funny, because it's all true ^_^
Wrek|Dusty: this is brilliant, ty so much
-lol- jesus disc :D
I am British :P
proud of doing drugs? I guess not, but proud of being addicted to drugs might just help fuel your addiction, just my two cents Kandarihu
And this is funny :P
ot funny
Iron_Edge: I now want a jesus disc
not*
05Kandarihu: just stop thinking that your view on things is the only right one.
Blasphayouuuuu~
Iron_Edge: it will go amongst my collection of apple-related memorabilia
Sylandest: -lol- :D
knackered. :3
Flam, Flem, Flim, Flom and Flum.
Brothers.
Kandarihu: If someone for some reason is proud of their drug abuse, let them be proud of it? Does it ruin your life when others are proud of themselves or what they do?
Wrek|Dusty: could you please stop thinking that my view on things is taboo?
05atleast I am not acting like my view is the only one.
my mum was whinging at me about something i miss much
This sketch is dog's bollocks (amidoinitrite?)
All I said is that I wasn't going to watch. You could've left it at that, and we wouldn't be getting into this fight.
Well actually, it depends what drugs, it could mean medicine or psycedelic drugs.
SirGanjalf: :D
SirGanjalf: i see what u did there
alexxm: oh?
HA!
Kandarihu: You could've left "I'm not gonna watch" part out. What's your point?
hey Sylandest1 hows your day been
05You said he was confused. that sentence implies you know that he is. in fact. why is he confused? what causes you to think he's confused?
WAT!?
alexxm: hehe, its been good so far. Loving the stream at the moment
Sounds like Hitler
Far too!
Lolhi
BRB
LL :3
12hai o.o
Not him, he was describing someone, and it relates to Hitler
dat Diablo
05doesnt seem too confused to me, he is comfortable as he is. no reason to hate on it.
why did the spainish inquisation happen my history classes never covered it
05alexxm: religion
Dunno, my school didn't care either
'dat wub
thanks Wrek|Dusty
If anything he seems 100% secure in his sexuality, walking around like that
My mom came in the room and said, "Why are you watching Eddie Izzard?" I said "That guy's Eddie Izzard" She said, "Yeah that's him."
alexxm: religion, like Wrek said
-lol- :D

Oh man. There was no way we could see that coming.
What a PERFECT FUCKING RECTANGULAR trail of blood.

hi Meanwhile
Isn't it?
*Monster comes from outside**runs outside* LOGIC!
Yeah, I'm just gonna take this..
BATMAN VS PREDATOR

RX-78-SweetieBot: Why does that sentence fill me with unrelenting dread?
avp 1 is good
I don't care what anyone says, if my kid says there's a frikken snake demon in my laundry, I'm gonna listen to 'em. :|

They will never find him in this pool!
honey? what happened to the pool?
MWHAHAHAHAH
Bloody annoying alexxm, I've spent the whole day trying to make my new graphics card work.
And thats what happens if you add to much chlorine to the pool.
so is the predator good
the blue stuff removes all evidence of aliens and people the predator kills
Wasn't this like, space marines landed on a wierd pyramid, activated predator program and all shit went loose?
brb
how did that go Meanwhile
RX-78-SweetieBot: i was about to show it to him too:D
:3
Magical_pablez94: You sent that to me! :D
RainbowDash: hAI
Aliens.Mov
It was an Alien

Comet , that would be something 6_9
Ninjazz: yeah.. i know! sorry again about that :D
You know how these guys are not dead?
the Alien didnt kill those kids... its was the bad script
Wrek: Get some for me plase?
Magical_pablez94: I still don't see how you could think I am Meanwhile... :D

Ninjazz: Eh?

That's nice Kamm.
i alway hold my shotgun in my hand when i sleep im not jokeing
Magical_pablez94: something wrong?
there's no suspense here, is there?
if aliens like these come to earth, we'd better have motionscanners and some guns with real firepower
Well that is going good :D
that's a shame. :s

Woodenshy|Facebook_a: Nope

Did he just say rape?
OMC I HAVE MY OWN EMOTION

So how come AvP2 is up? Preparation for the Trilogy next week?
I am seriously thinking about buying myself a civil handgun when I'm adult.
GTFO!
Shame, I would've liked the movie to have SOME suspense.
this movie would have been awesome had they not included humans in the story
She gonna die too

"The government doesn't lie to people." Some Idiot. 1981-2012

Hello TheGreatAndPowerfulT
"The government doesn't lie" Hahah. . . Now that was funny.
03all the threads just change the domain

thats rich..
Indeed.
Politicians never lie to people! :D
Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
Ah ha ha ha, good joke
WindWhistler: Lol, I know. I'm just being snarky. :P
the author should be publicly flogged for this line
FillyFlam: Oh.

Lying politicians? NO WAI
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhhhhh Burn!
AH HA HA HA

Ew
Isha mura.
Hey Ninjazz.
Cleavage much?
:)
DitzyHooves: which one, the one where all the pony races gathered to debate about what to do?
OH FUCK she just said FUCK
The sky?
About fuckin' time.
13inb4 suggestive comments about something falling off after touching it
Where the fuck is Issac?

Isaac Newton?
No Isaac?
Dead.
...."Cracker Starship"
Who thought this was okay to stream?
Ninjazz: No spoiling! :[
o.O
10Wat
Neo-Changling-Ridley: This is a prequel film
They are the same castle
Neo-Changling-Ridley: where was gondor when Neo-Changling-Ridley wanted to know where isaac was
Irish_Pony: I just said what she said. :S
May I add something stupid here?
This looks like similar animation used in the Hellboy cartoons.
everytime i see anime i alway see woman have big **** if you know what i mean -_-
Main character - human version of Gilda, in space, from da future!1
Vordox: maybe
Ninjazz: Still count! :[
Ninjazz: Thats what she said :3
Well I'm off, guys. Cya!
is stream over?
Om: very much so..
05beign a dead space fan
big feet?
DitzyHooves: Good eye, Im gonna have to look at that
the castle in Hearth's warming is the same castle from the first episodes
she is the gurl that dies in dead space ignition???'
bai MegaMoonShine
Kipkat07_USAF: Oh you. :3
"Where is my healthmeter" "On your back" "Why there? I can't see it" "Oh, cause they designed it like that" "huh...."
Wrek: fanfiction?
See you MegaMoonShine
05this movie was awesome for backstory :3
The one sane man
Bye MegaMoonShine
Irish_Pony: I remember you saying the same thing. >:3
03LOL
:$ fuck :$
dead space movie?
it ties iin Ponyville history nicely I think
Ninjazz: When?
I tried to play deadspace one. I got killed to much xD
Wrek: The game's better.
is there a dead space mlp cross over fanfic?
is she the girl that dies on the ignition game????????
Those guys look really really similar.
so what show is this
Hellow
Irish_Pony: "OH FUCK SHE SAID FUCK"
Bronysith: More than likely
There.
So where is Issac's girfriend?
Ninjazz: i just fucking said it
What is this? Dead Space the animated Series?
Oh come on, this is NOT for kids. People gonna get gored.
Ninjazz: I dont remember that...:S
Wives.
Neo-Changling-Ridley: ded
Is she in this movie at all
Neo-Changling-Ridley: yes
excuse me wrek just out of curiosity are you going to play dead space aftermath after this?
Stop fucking saying fuck!
after Celestia banished her sister I'm guessing she had to rest (like King Arthur)
Neo-Changling-Ridley: WHo?
yeah,. can't think of anything atm
Thats a lot of tologists.
Bronysith, Irish_Pony: I apologize. I'm getting sleep deprived again. :S
WORDS..
Ninjazz what show is this
ughhhh that british accent
Ninjazz: THE HUNGER GAMES
as big an animation fanatic as I am, how is I never heard of this series O_o
Oh hey its Meanwhile
I don't remember her name all i know is she was Issac's girlfriend
/me is waiting for a Hunger Games Game.
most i can think of is volatile 1-use things in medical or w/e
leaving the pony races to rule themselves ...... it didn't work
Cypresswolf: For a reason? :P
05Cypresswolf: its no series
05its a movie
alexxm: This ins't a show this is a movie based aoff a game called Dead Space.
Cypresswolf: Its not a series is a short film
03clothes? :P
the secret of death
13I HAVE
05Obsidian: wrong
Bronysith: Never seen it. :S
thanks Ninjazz
Ninjazz: good game play... not scary
13a "choco stick" apparently
05its a long movie
and they evacuated to the cave (where Canterlot was built)
well 75 min are hardly a movie :P
Bronysith: Agreed.
:O Boy am I out of the loop!
Obsidian: How short
Okay maybe no short
13like a chocolate ice lolly but smaller
13but calling it a choco stick feels weird
03also FFS< these screen protectors are fairly bad once they've been on my DSi XL for a while
Ninjazz: not talking about the lame ass movie. talking about the excellent book
03it started ripping the screen LOL
Wrek: Why is it that this movie isnt as popular as when it first came out?
excuse me Wrek just out of curiousity will we watch dead space aftermath after this?
13Irony~
Bronysith: Ooooohhhhh. Still haven't read it. :$
05probably not
Douche capt :d
Making the movie is easier than making the games?
What a well kept beard!
Ninjazz: check it out sometime
03inb4 want some of my choco stick
Why do the people in power always ignore dangerous shit like this?
kk i never saw it my friend said it was good Wrek
Where have I heared this guy before????
Bronysith: I might. I got a friend who wont stop talking about it.
Dat voice...
has anyone else seen the brony thing pbs did
Cypresswolf don't feel bad. The only reason I became aware of this movie was becuase my little brother was obsessed with Dead Space after thefirst one came out.
I know it..
Dat finger
/me thinks Pocky
13no thanks, yours doesn't seem all that appetising :B
"Kindness?"
Ninjazz: it is brilliantly written in the first person. double spaced makes it an easy read page turner
Me too, Om. She was in a few movies. Also in Lost I think.
