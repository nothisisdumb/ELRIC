THIRD attempt at burning Madoka disc 2
that anime is cursed, it keeps breaking my computer
it'll get to about 25% and then completely freeze, and ImgBurn is stupid and can't be killed
you have to reboot
i use nero7
>Nero
>Dual layer
Not to mention I found a very convincing blog on why you shouldn't ever use Nero to burn DVDs
I pretty sure 79th's Farewell To Gibraltar would fit as background music
something about layer breaks>?
/me runs
Tolerate and less tolerate
hate and bicker
weel, which version of nero?
Hate and discriminate.
whatever one was current when they wrote about it
I've got Nero 9 or something now but don't really care
ImgBurn is Free®

also look, ImgBurn froze again
dat macgyver
i've never bothered asking before
durka?
rooting iirc applies to android phones
never seen macgyver, but luuv the title music
rooting an android phone allows you to run pirated apps
like those stupid nagware crap that comes with it
um
rite?>
you can run pirated apps without root
oh
like deleting system apps
oh, and free wi-fi tethering.
