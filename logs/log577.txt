They've made some bad installments. 12, I hear was great.
Erm isn't that Elder scrolls/Fallout
Five bits says it isn't even that creepy.
00,03Somethin' like that~
Deus ex is supposedly an amazing rpg

It's a really interesting hybrid
00,03I hope!
11,01Scootapasta?
See? An improvment?\
/me is a sucker for screamers
see FFx/X-2 :)
Skyrim improved on the last games voice actors!
Yep!
a bit quiet
*cheap asses*
/me remembers games before there were VA's in them
^
Daggerfall! :D
Morrowind is amazing
11,01Ryunosuke: Same.
11,01Read the text.
Ohay Gumby X3
the problem with alot of games
morrowind was best elder
is that they are becoming... interactive movies basically
11,01Some AAA titles are.
00,03That is Igglybuff, i believe
Morrowind had a bad engine.
I'm gonna go play TF2 to for bit :P
Climbing?
Hello everypony.
One thing skyrim lacks is....fun
Yes, you could clim on houses and walls if you were good enough in that skill.
but I did like morrowid over skyrim simply due to skills
climb**
or spears?
that was hilarious
i pissed myself with laughter when that happened
flight of icarus
Anyone else like RTS games? Rise of nations, Stonghold Crusaders, LOTR:BFME?
11,01Talking rods.
The problem with Skyrim is all the sexual mods
08,01sexual mods?
can we actualy watch some pony related vids soon
Do tell
Oh dear, you've awoken Saturn.
Morrowind had ... explicit mods as well
damit
majoras mask <3
why
Of course.
CBB/UNP mods
00,03You know what's coming...
Good evening everypony.
i wanted it to be donkey kong 64
08,01Dj_Cyber-4G: because we're watching something else
Inb4 you've met with terrible fate haven't you.
basically a full nudity mod
i said soon not now
I wanted donkey kong 64
I find that skyrim is ok but is underrated for the current tech.
Hi Saturn~
I mean underated grapics and NPC engine.
08,01oh, also, we're streaming Die Hard and Star Wars tonight, iirc
As in they such!
suck*
Saturn ane before, and after and at random times over the week :D
dat noise
Saturn: I AM FUCKING PUMPED
Saturn: for star wars
Saturn: is star wars first?
when are you starting with the movies? I hate time difference...
Scoot-Scootaloo.mp4
13this doesn't mean you get to pester the person streaming with requests
08,01Bronysith: i'm trying to get the Despecialised Editions uploaded for streaming tonight, but i'm not sure if i'll be able to in time
fings look normal now
08,01Bronysith: currently compressing it down from 6GB...
Saturn: despecialized please! those are the movies i watched as a kid
08,01Bronysith: exactly
I remember this game...I was like 10 when I first played and was clueless.
08,01if it happens, it happens
now its weird
I rented it and err...
08,01if i can't get it to Slurry in time, we'll just have to make do; at least for the first one
08,01i'll certainly have the other two uploaded to him in time
You shouldn't have done that.
Saturn: empire strikes back is the one with the least changes
Alright.. O_O
AND EXPLODE
BUUUUUUURN
O_O
happens to me everytime
ok that was unexpected
Die Hard and Star Wars tonight? Isn't that a bit hardcore? :O
What...just....happened?!?!?!??!?!
Fish link is a fish. Link.

8,6Sonic Monoboom?
00,03^
phake
08,01Bronysith: like there are only 10 star trek films...
not
Strange lights are best lights.
LUNA!
08,01and 3 Alien films
08,01and 3 Indiana Jones films
Saturn: 2. There are 2 Alien films.
Hallo my nubile young fillys.
not me
00,03I'm not saying it was aliens...
Saturn: :D
00,03...but it was Aliens.
00,03-_- ninja'd
08,01Meanwhile: aw come on, Alien 3 was okay!
If they were Aliens in the sky, they would had killed us already >.>
00,03Monoboom! :D
Saturn: Alien 3? What's that?
08,014 was actually written by Joss Whedon
This is Hasbros PR event for season 3
that was RD practicing, she was only able to break the sound barrier
08,01it's porbably the worst thing he's ever written
08,01Alister: /)
that was derpy
08,019, 10, and 5 did not exist.
As soon as i see the fox news logo...
xD
Fox "News"
Hate detected
Saturn: baby hybryd Alien was weird
00,03Look at all those people...
Saturn: I have to disagree with you , Scieticists agree that the TNG stark trek movies are not star trek movies
Scientists*
Its Called, Clouds
HATERS HAVE COME FOR US
13oh good time for the internet's hourly "hurr fox sux"
Well it does.
this song..
Age of empires 2
08,01Alister: i'm sorry, but you're wrong. First Contact was one of the best of the entire run.
did he just call her Shawty?
00,03Oh snap guys! Requim for a Dream song! This is SRS BSNS
now for the overly dramatic music
08,01this is universally accepted
Yup
was the best thing about a movie I didn't like...if I only remembered the name^^
08,01it's hard fact that the best Trek films, in order, were: 2, 4, and 8
Saturn: as long as you accept that there are only 3 star wars movies...
08,01descending order, i might add
13*liarshizu.bmp*
hi everyone... are we watcvhing Ufos?
than*
Aliens are probably laughing at us right now
ALIENSSSSSSS
08,01:P
They are coming for yo wife!
13and generations
13insurrection was just bad
ugh
untill someone bothers to fly up there and look, i don't give a shit
there was no reason for more Alien movies after Alien2
I meant as being rude to him.
OK I think they are realzies now
08,01Shizuka: they were both basically the same film, though
And... I just crossed the line again.
If those were really aliens we would already know, i mean how many satalites do we have orbiting the earth?
ooh, purty :3
lol, Russia
rockey
i think it's just celestia visiting earth :P
How long is this?
Um...
> Aliens come to greet us, > Lets take them prisoners and disect them to look at their organs

STAR WARS TIME
The acting and story are all pretty boring, the only thing that really makes it special are the special effects
freude :)
The prequels DID exist.
And in this day and age they're hardly mind blowing.
They still do.
die hard???
Time for some multitasking
I really highly suggest searching for an english translation of this song
And honestly....they're not as shit as people say.
I did it twice, and I'm very ashamed of it.
LOL Intermission
They just weren't all that great, Now then. Intermission!
Erm...
Und dann intermission.

Hey, that's something we don't see often. A stormtrooper shoots and actually hits his target
HAHAHA Dit R2-D2 walk therE?XD
why is r2-d2 walking like that???
Stormtroopers hit targets all the time. Just not lead characters.
sooo...how much do lazer shots cost...Just shoot the damn thing!:O
Take her away
buffer...:(
It seems the stun beam covered the entire width and height of the corridor. It's more of a wave than a beam. That's why the stormtrooper was able to shoot her. Missing is physically impossible.
The senate? PFFFTT
Star...Bucks?
BUFFERING
why didn't you shoot it like I told you?! :O
night evey one
One does not simply stop Darth Vader
Hey, everyone!
it was FINE for Die Hard
Logically said, it would make tactical sense for the stormtroopers to set their blasters to stun for ALL engagements. If they're ordered to kill, they still have their feet and fists for that.
