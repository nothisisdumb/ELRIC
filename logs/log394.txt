It's fun being born as cancer, actually.
Well, I suppose there's that.
But it makes being called cancer more fun.
Being born with cancer is hardly fun
Alright, fine.
Being born under cancer.

:D
O___o
Quite a few actually
Why you ask?

goddammit
'tis a joke
who's reading MLD:
I feel bad for them
Not right now.
The fanfic is now 20% more kosher
I've read MLD... didn't do anything for me
Anyone want to see how it " kinda" looks like where i live?! :D
Why the hay not.

Why not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0iCR4scRxE This was the first day though, lots more right now
xD
you'll need it
Dat ö.
I hate snö.
It's too cold.
Snö is awesome
That day it was around -20
celsius ofcourse
Good Goddesse.
Snö is good if you dont get it much or if you like/love winter sports
Goddesses*
Kelvin is the RIGHT tempature measuring scale
Fahrenheit is just silly.
Yeah.
I can tell you a story
Proceed, then.
Does anyone know of Rankin for temperature
No, wait, that's wrong
30 degrees Celsius = 545.67 rankine
that would be +241 only, just 241k
xD
K damnit!
actually the most persice measurement of temparture is in Joules
Wasn't it also used as the boiling point for Mercury or something silly like that?
its 10000 joules outside ^_^
Hmm, ok.
:P

you have to heat hydrogen up to 100 times the sun's tempature to get fusion to begin
The energy isn't extracted from cold though.
energy isnt extraced from anything... :/
No, it's converted

That's how you break physics

Anyone ever read The Crucible?
I've got one
Not bad eh inglourious?
oh, Lord of the Flies
speaking of books does anyone have a fanfic?
Not bad. Also watched the movie tied to it. Also not bad for the type of book-to-movie movie
I wrote a fanfic and am writing one now
movieception
/me is reminded of the upcoming Hunger Games movie now
whats urs called?!
/me has never read the Hunger Games, nor is interested

I don't like reading. Yes, it was assigned.

that's wallpaper wrothy right there
I just recall that every year there were 4 main books we had to read. I think the only one that I tried to read was Wuthering Heights
Hmm Wuthering Heights... that rings a bell...
I like reading in Latin
We got assigned Of Mice and Men at one point
www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqKdH569OwQ
It was an okay book for me
Kind of boring and ended on a bad note
Lord of the Flies was never assigned
It's a good song
Not reading the Cambridge Latin course? You all make me sad
I was able to skip reading Lord of the Flies by moving to another school :p
Cambrige Latin course? What's that? :P
It's a series of Latin story books disguised as textbooks that teach you Latin as you read
GOAL
hehe
The only book I read that wasn't assigned was, wait for it.....
Land of the Unicorns
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD1TcUzhb9o&feature=related lol
yeh they got those for all the mane 6 and some others
I'm homeschooled. i'm taking Spanish in co-op and Latin in my online school
nice rainbow. I remember that
*Takes Spanish while already taking Latin*...*Three Spanish Lessons Later* "AH DIOS PORQUE"
