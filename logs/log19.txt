Hey dari
Yeah?
7BBL.
and it didn't kill my computer
D:
:P
:D
Well it was just the song.
Lol
It must've developed a tolerance...
Actually I think the bluescreen happened because I was trying to muffle the sound under a pillow and it overheated
XD
XD
Lol.
LOL
Fail.
and it IS a netbook :P
yep
Why would you even resort to that?
because it was really loud and I couldn't get the volume control to work
Forced shutdown would have made you lose something?
Haha, but it was worth smothering with a pillow?
I only did it for a few seconds at a time and hoped it wouldn't overheat
/me dies her hair blonde
um. an unallocated partion can't be deleted
just spnding to much time with a pollock such as myself maybe
:P
Homophones, lol.
Yeah she is, isn't is dye? :P
dingdingding.
seriously though I probably wouldn't even have thought of the computer overheating
I was afraid it might but figured it wouldn't if I didn't do it for too long <.<
Computer overheats I R KNOW PUT IN WASSER TO CALL IT DOWN
That is pretty weird. But you said it was a netbook, and those thing swill heat up at the drop of a hat in my experience.
yes
:D
WASSER IZ ONLY QURE
I'm not that stupid, dari
XD
my sister tried drowning our cat when we were little
Maybe StormBlond is.
*legitimate
lol
my stupid doppelganger has a name!
she dunked it into a plastic golf bag (headfirst) and held it there
Using that instead of legitimate in future. XD Awesome.
plasmatic, that is all
how do you pronouce that? legi-i-ment?
Lay-gee-mit.
*mate
I was about to comment on the -ment. :P
legi'imet
kinda figured that
like when people say ma'am
instead of madam
That's for a different reason, but if it helps you sound it out, that works.

Brock finally got sick of Ash dragging him everywhere
it has to make more sense with context
I mean really
I have a comic that makes it make sense
oh, I thought he threw him into the air
the camera panned up and all
Dari's right. In the uncut Japanese version he just rapes Ash.
O.o
I don't believe you
@_@
I'm bulbapedia'ing it
I'm not sure. I'll look as well.
How the heck did that make it here when an episode with Jynx was banned because of "racial stereotypes"?
I can't remember, you need to look up the Japanese name.
"Brock is considered the most mature, wise and level-headed of the main characters, and he is arguably the most intelligent character as well."
NO HE'S NOT
Well, they're all basically morons.
I've fooled them with things more farfetched than this.
I'm very good at rhetoric. Plus, they're more prone to believe it psychologically if we both say the same story.
this is the name of a quiz I stumbled accross
"Can you name the Brock's Pokemon?"
the Brock
Have you never wondered how he got his name?
no, I have not
What's not normal about Brock in comparison?
I feel like I've known a Brock before
I think that was one of the American Olympic volleyball people. No joke. :P
Well, Brock Lesner is a UFC fighter.
And a douchebag.

Lol - calculations.
I know. It would all have to based on assumption, seeing as he would have to determine the exact year the Earth was finishe forming, which he claims to know.

12oh wait
Total level is now over 1500 XD
I wanna solo peace >:(
Peaca*
<.>
12solo peaca hard mode when it comes out
You can't solo Peaca
12sure you can
12you enter with people then everyone leaves
12just ask 3 people to join with you then leave when they enter
Hard Mode Rundal is bad enough
Already tried that
Everyone wants to do Peaca
Especially with a pro -.-
12find some noobs then that won't even leave a dent
Done that
None of them quit
I want the EXP/Rewards to myself
3 alts
12your total level is 1500, share some glory
12i know
and Dialga, you CAN'T use Alt's on Mabi, unless you have more than 1 comp
In my case I have 1 comp
Well 2
acquire 3 more computers
-.-
KITTEN!
:D
Solo'ing Hard Mode Alby Intermediate is no longer fun
only one exlamation point eh
*exclamation

Ciar Advanced Hard Mode solo is fun

I don't even get a greeting :<
Notce how I was first :

12that was enough
Hard Mode of it though
Hmm
Not sure, not tried it yet
yesh
well, a lot more than one
Well having R1 on all Combat skills
I can one shot every enemy in Ciar Adv (Including the boss)

One shotting Ogre Warriors is fun too

Cat: think of all the background processes
if I am going over 2 gigs, it is generally cheaper to get the full 4
yeah, go for 4
yeah, go for that
32bit
definitely
why?
why?
64-bit is more futureproof?
issues*
it means you can use more than 3.5GB of ram
bah
I guess.
I have yet to encounter any compatibility issues
and I generally don't come up with compatibility issues
12wb ecco
and any 32 bit programs seem to get their own folder
meh, thats why there is compatability mode
o_O
yeah, they do
64-bit can still run 32-bit programs
C;\programfiles(86)
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138294
this might work
not futureproof though
other than perhaps if you have an ancient cpu that doesn't support 64-bit

I have a normal ATX motherboard at the moment
next one would be nice if it was extended-ATX, preferably with SLI support
I have a motherboard that I got with my comp
its fine for now.,
you probably have 4 ram slots
that's the most common amount
I have 2

12Armageddon any idea? lol
uh
you could have 2 of the same scripts
which you do
you need to change the variables
12i did
and well
you should only have one script
12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %kranick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
12vs
12ctcp *:say:*: if ($nick == %espynick) /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ )
that should work
12you saw the resuls
12*results
hm
Hai Arti!
well try
12hi
12when did you get that wb message
ctcp *:say:*: { if ($nick == %kranick) { /msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ ) } elseif ($nick == %espynick) { msg $$2 $$3- ( $+ $nick $+ ) } }
that should work but it'll fuck up if the nick is in both vars

Tcg games~
:3
just use a Dragunity deck
ew dragunity
basically go
Dragunities are boring
i run Vayu Turbo :P
Or use blackwings
but hard to get out :P
lightsworns got fucked by the TCG rules
yeah it's hard to get out
needs 1 tuner + 2
yeah
and the tuner has to be blackwing
Blizzard from the far north~
that card is nice
but reason is Silverwind is hard to get out now
due to kalut
being at 1
Army
the best combo is
Sirrc + bora
use sicc into bora -3700 beaststick piercing
OH
the 2 k normal summon one
that card
lmaaaao
you summon sicc first
or lots of boras :P
I once had someone
best part is when
normal sicc
add bora
speical 3 boras
card is overpowered I swear
I still think Silverwind is the best
8400 piercing
on field
pretty much
or you could use sircc's effect
I never use that card
also
Thought Ruler Archfiend <3
favourite character is still Sayer

TV show is fading out
http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Girl-to-Kiss-You-if-You-Are-a-Girl
Airplane and SpaceBalls put together into one movie
really in the US? I mean the anime and movies have phased out in the UK already asides from Jetix still showing D/P and the movies do get shown in chronological order on CN and Jetix
but DVD release, the last one we had after Jirachi movie was movie 10
hehe

02O-o Angel..
06So it was a very 0/1 thing going on there

oh sorry
:D
this situation is not too upsetting to me
because Viz squats on their licenses
12If the anime was like the manga...it would be awesome ¦3
ew
um no
it might have failed and remained obscure
kk
in this case it would not
the TV show was a huge hit for the first two seasons as it existed because it seemed to have something for everyone in that era
not to mention a main girl with a significant depth in personality
plus it was before Brock's skirt chasing got out of hand

03yay US-International keyboard layout?

<(ϟϟ)>
I have never seen a US International keyboard

03nickstr, um
03the whole point of US International is that it's a standard US keyboard
x.x
03that you set to act as an international one
ok
drf needs some APPLE juice
03now, my laptop actually has a "US International' layout, in that instead of right alt, it says ALT GR
03but that's really the only difference
mine is just US
03so is this one I'm using
I can set it up to be internation on the computer

Oh, Ammeg
she was being a typical Ammeg and said basically nothing useful whatsoever
and I quote: "lollollol"

I've noticed she hasn't been AS bad around the forum lately
she doesn't just reply to EVERY single thing someone says as much

04hey

:D
She's been worse, if you ask me.
oh yeah?

I think she just makes everything up for attention.

04All I need for programming is just a few calculators for damage and calling to other frames when someone presses a button...
04Maybe this is more complex than I thought XD

@Chimera*
04well yeah
04you
04're right
04but like
derp
04I wanted calculators for damage as well

can't remember
04heh

02I'm here... lurking... like a boss
let me guess
and you are currently at level 3 or 2
02yep
022
but yes
Where are you now
Gawd
betchj
But yeah
02.-.
but there is no other way around it
I strongly
fuck
I order you
02They were too many >-<
02I can kill one or two at the same time
to at least gain some spells from the Temple or Mages Guild
02But 7
that act as..
027?!
okay you used that meme
and seriously?
02Yeah ;_;
Or
somehow they spawned alot there
02I tried to run, and they still raped me
thats because if you run they can still hit you
02;_;
02Yeah
Go to Caldera
get a good weapon
get her to hla ode
talk to her about being a bad trader
kill her
take the boots
and it'll have a benefit
02Ki-- ...
and a consequence
ZA WARUDO
02Inb4: rape
inb4 corpse babies
:o
you can guess the consequence by its name
the boots of Blinding Speed
02I've been raped by merchants before ;_;
02not fun.
..
okay
do you have
Fuck
which sucks
/me has it at 35 ._.
Why are you using swords
yeah, it still sucks
Equip a firestaff
Firestaffs are still weapons
in Morrowind, you bash them
02I wish I had one in the firstplace
you can use the magic quality of it
wands
staves
rofl
but it can still be a melele weapons
is
armor
yeah morrowind was hard as balls
02I have been stuck in melee combat for a good while ¬¬
fuck don't listen to Griggs
You suck hard
is graphics were good
Build one
04grah
04Now I know why I'm using 3.0
02Imperial armor
043D transforming X_X
..
rofl
02:D
I agree with Griggs for once
02Funfact: I know
like Orcs
lol
but I use Redoran Armor
I know :P
lol
023
Nub
No
02Kthx
Imp?
like worms
oh
uhm...
but paralize you
/me shrugs
02Oh, I know
I haven't played Morrowind in years
02Low, very very LOW.
or curicass
as the world calls it
I recommend you train with spells for the moment
02hmm..
but now he's Patriarch of it
02O-o
or Ald'Rhun
and Caledra
*Caldera
because you can get some good weapons and training at Al'Rhun
02aside from looting people/houses
Well there are numerous ways
doing jobs for instances
random jobs
like side-quests
hence doing that Boots of Blinding Speed
02is that merchant "easy to kill"
There are some other things like Guar
02Hmm..
she was easy for me to kill
for I'm an Orc
and killed Umbra when I was on level 7
make it go up to forty
then go to Caldera
follow the road
you may ignore the naked Nord
go to east
then east
find her
and follow the signs to Hla Ode
02signs :D
and by easy
*east
I mean go by the road via east
there are two forks in the road
which causes confusion for the naked nords quest
..
the fuck
why didn't you use a Silt Strider
02I got lost :D
in here
thats the fun part about Morrowind
you get lost
02Because I didn't knew of it's existence after a while
and get money
is to go to Balmora
02yeah
02that's why I went there
don't do it for a long time
02.____.
I didn't do the second quest of the main quest for..
for I was doing guild and Great Houses quests
its alot easier
02yeah
and if you wanna be a warrior join house Redoran
fuck Telvanni
and fuck Hlaaly
*Hlaalu
just opportunistics and isolationists
02.-.
hlaalu is an Imperial Cock-sucker
Basically
and is very aggressive
pro-foundly fond of Slavery
and for warrior status
is Redoran
02Hmm..
/me checks
02here they go:
02Destruction = 48
02restauration = 35
02enchant = 20 (lol)
02alchemy = 20
02conjuration = 11
02and Illusion = 10
the first two are moderate
but work on them more
make them at least 50 or 60
work on ullusion and conjuration
02'k
its good either way
like Almsivi Intervention
and some restoration spells
on conjuration at least

D:
why not?
i know a lot you have to do weird power cycles and crap
but I can ping the router
ad telnet into it.
Damn airfare. It's outrageous. Round trip it would cost me $600 bucks (plus air taxes) at the cheapest.

Hi.

me.
see, I instantly thought sixth graders
meaning 11 year olds :P
Yeah, well this was 17-19 year olds. :P
would that make you a fifth former?
Well that's the old system for naming the years in school, people only use sixth form to name the optional years of school after the age of 16, none of the previous years.
I'm year 11.
Sixth formers describes people in year 12 and 13.

is it amd?
have you read a product brief ?
yea
ewwwwwwwwwwwww AMD D:
cores *
meh
Phenom II
noice
Why dont you just put out like 10% more money and get an intel.
basically the module shares certain hardware portions between the two cores
there probably isn't *that* much difference between them anyway
yea I have a I5 760 and I have a phenom II x4 impressed with them both
not really cat
Cat: I meant when you got it..
trust me I have played with enough hardware lol
it's like the difference between ati and nvidia
that is, not very much
its negligible
I prefer Nvidia myself but thats just preference
I use nvidia
seems nice enough
I have always used both ..... but when intel was running with netburst architecture I was staying with AMD
netburst was just eww
what's netburst all about?
I've used both intel and amd
it was the old pentium 4 architecture
read about it
then I "upgraded" it
by which I mean I threw away everything but the hard drive and replaced them
hehe.
lol
I pay for 25/1

sort of a rant that some of you might find unfavorable but it had to be said
I saw it
and I don't want it
lol
yes
\and the colours still have that turqouise tint
is it two discs are just one
oh whaat
DL or flippie?
no
two SEPARATE discs
nono,
EWW
EWW
EWW
is the current release a DL or flippie?
EWW
EWW
I don't know
that is why I asked you
i dont' know either
oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
if its two separate discs I could perhaps justify it
good: if it's native, not upscaled.
bad: it was surround on the DVD
EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW EWW
ITS A SINGLE DISC
EWW EWW
no
I want the English version
cuts and all
no BS restored version
I would say bullspit but EWW CURSING KICK
its because I don't want those
no filtering
no "cut restores"
nothing
just a raw rip from the disc
or MPEG AVC transport stream
preferably the second of the two
but either way NO CHANGES
I want to AVOID buying this
untouched
and dubbed in English
11.•10«11WB10 (eXAKR10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Nah, I ate the scanner this time
>>oh, dw, drf'll prolly upload it sometime
ENGLISH DUBBED
UNTOUCHED
those are key words here
yes
that means no filtering and no cut restores
>uploading a BDMV
from the screen shot given there it looks fine
>drf bothering to touch it
>mfw
not the whole disc
most people want both
not me
you'll either have to download all of it, or ask someone which m2ts is M5
because the distributer is run by a bunch of idiots
movies 4 and 5 would have made far more sense
Mirimax has the rights to both
think about this:
1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, etc
if.
we'll see if STARZ_HD bloadcasts a proper M4 in HD,
ohohoho
i brought one a month+? ago because i wanz my HDz and i am limited by internets.
provided my local rental has it (and half+ the time they don't)
in my case its because I am giving the format second thoughts
and positive ones in this case
well, BD is one of the onry legal ways that they are distributing movies on HD.
you can AVCHD-DVD, but baisically nooone commercial movie studios use those
microwave oven looks attractive for that purpose
then shredder after that
it creates a nice light show though
gravel road
maybe by around one or two dollars
still quite significant in value

12How much does a AM signal generator cost?
several hundred dollars to several thousands
mine was about $80
12Ah
12Well that’s awesome, I had no idea those where even affordable
only about 13 were made
12How often do you usally have it sending off a signal?
12usually*
every once in a while
sometimes for making sure the AM receivers I have work properly but much of the time its to play my own selection of music on air

The thing is an image, though

hi Angel
13LOL
12Like a smoothie

At least, for the people watching. xD
I can give you a trial
it looks like its hosted from india
without hitting the skin for like $10
13I can't do it at all though |D
DUDE. I tried that after watching Aliens. XD
I tried it with an eraser...I am pretty good at it
I want usa
yeah
x.x
people just WANT to have their body parts mangled apparently
13xD
to borrow words from thoreau :P
quite literally
That reminds me of the time I jumped in rose bushes with my friends. We didn't know they were because it was nighttime, but we did know after one of my friends yelled in pain. Then we laughed at him while we held back out own pain.
its alright
dont bother
lol
4Why were you jumping in bushes?
that would be supremely painful
I'd done it
4DOING SOMTHING BAD AND RUNNING FROM THE COPS?
accidentally though XD
No.
We were trying to scare drivers passing by.
Actually, yeah, it was bad.
xD
seedboxes
+vps's
13I used to have rose bushes in my garden
I have made 2 sales
good
keep doing that
4xD
you need to pretty much sign up 20-30 customers a day
4(no it wasnt me )
night nick
4and chased us xD
13Goodnight Nick :3
start an affiliate program and give a lot per customer.
what's messed up is, the only way to get a shortcut to my school is to go through a bunch of thorny bushes and muddy sand
:OO
12Goodnight!
I can't see how it's worth it
4xD
Heya guys :D
you wont make any money in the next 6 months to 1 year
Kosovo!!!!
/me glomps Kosovo~
/me is glomped
/me is also glomped :o
Oy, the glomps never end.
/me glomps Manlyguy
yeah :)
:P
. -.
Look, I just want a damn dedi
/me glomps Manlyguy
thats all I am doing this for
yes.
I need $75/mo
I am too young for a job
you are never too young to work.
dont ever use that excuse.
I am
I applied in 2 places, both said I am too young
do a paper round or chores for people
eep!
I still don't fit in after nearly two years. xD
/me is glomped
you fit in just as much as I do, manly. :P
I said work, not slaving
12!pokemon
xxLatiosxx, you are a 2Kyogre.
12SURFS UP DOODS
quite the contrast .-.
You sure? I do hold back quite a chunk of my personality, mostly because I'd get banned if I showed it. A lot of people say I'm mean RL, but that's just me being me. xD
but you aren't mean D:
there's a difference?
13Kyogre
AERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13:c
AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I said jobs, not a career
meh
12THEY TASTY
Did you even read the first sentence. XD
12MOAR
lol
yes
I did :P
HEEEEEEEEEEEY
HEYYYYY!
How about the second? lmfao
LIKE, I HAVENT SEEN YOU IN A WHILE
IKR?!
yes, lol
I've read the seventh sentence too
04http://14-bis.deviantart.com/art/Blue-Umbreon-195032071 this is freaking awesome
12that is really awesome =o
a lot of my personality is different here too
Yo
for instance, I'm WAY more shy irl
I mean, if you want it for storage, you could get a massive-sized HDD for much cheaper
I'm a prankster RL. I don't pull any lol stunts on TST. On other sites, yes, but not TST. xD
and a lot less talkative and outspoken
something of that price is totally not worth it for online gaming
o.o
I need a fast speed
fast speeds*
12I have no idea to describe mine
at least 100mbit
same with Latios
why?
With the server, I get: 3TB HDD 16GB RAM 100mbit unmetered,
same here
Everyone seems to be like that here, haha.
it takes a lot to really get me to open up
because
cheap
We're awesome
:D

same XD
yeah~ anyway! how has everyone been?
:OO
laters
12High school = LOLdramalamaplace
7Ah, high school.
a lot of the friends I've made over my lifetime have either moved or betrayed me in some way
that's why I'm a lot more cautious
Many things
I still have alot of bffs that I still keep in contact with :3
12You know they're worth it if they stay in contact with you
first of all, security
I need a VPN
12its a two way thing though
