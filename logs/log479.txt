kirby is the best thing ever made
09,01Nittany, come to fighting games

09,01we don't deal with that bullshit
and even there we also had some good DS Kirby games
moar zelda games!
09,01unless it's lolCrapcom

It's great
second hand is just a loss for anyone involved in making games

08,01well, i hope you all enjoyed that
I surely did Saturn.:)
Thanks Saturn
09,01don't live in US, getting a PS3 soon, as well as an arcade stick

08,01is it desync'd or anything?
Saturn: Sagan is always great. thanks :)
The end! Thanks Saturn!
Saturn: Nah it was good
Saturn: Seems fine to me
11,01Anyway, online passes are a way for publishers and developers to make money off of used games.
Saturn: Kinda stuttering to me, but it's doable
11,01Which I think is wrong.
IT IS WRONG
I think it's unfair and unjustified.
then where would the money come from
wut
02Well
11,01Chrysalis: They already did in the initial sale.
dat console
TARDIS!
02Since the LPW became a Meme train

Once in a whale, they'll need some kelp

w-w-w-w-wall text
13duh

Yeaaaah... we're monkeys

O_O?
04LESS THAN ONE MINUTE
04FINAL WARNING
13but we need to consult ircops about that
implying we are digimons
lightirc has an option iirc
/me puts on SRS faic. lets do this!
PSYCHOTRIP!!!

04STOP
04Alright
I'm going to catch you! =D

/me 11,01presses pointless button.
/me eats pokeball
in other words, Trees are best ponies
11,01*shrug*
omg
Fluttershy is not trivial!
plants*
It'll appear when it can be bothered.
The music is going off pitch making the plants seem weird
dat souns
Oh lord
sounds*
Educational remix.
04However, I want to discuss the lack of communication that had been lingering between Team Leaders in the TL group; before last week it was hardly used because admins or departments would keep important bits of news or ideas concealed to their own departments or to SRS where it would get washed away amongst lighthearted chatter
11,02Moo :>
lol
E-e-e-e-e-e-evolu-lu-lu-lution
When everyone wakes up, I get sleepy.
Planty buisness.
11,02Lil_B: Hehe ^-^

Saturn: You ....err....The sound is ahead like...20 seconds
BLOOD
Ewwww bloooood
Meh, blood's fine. :)
YES
animation!
04We, as in Admins
oooh golgi apparatus
Blood is good for you
How old is this?
and filaments
and rough endoplasmatic reticulum
I probably shooldn't listen to this, because of how much the understanding of DNA has changed today

04Now
04Some of you may have heard: Quote of the Day
/me tapes Ninjazz's eyes open

I NOW THE MUSIC! BACKS AIR!
Bachs Air*

04*Alright
Wow, this animation IS old...
AWESOME powers
08,01er, sound desynced?
oh MY~

O_O
:O
08,01is that about where it was?
I heard "Shit"
sSlightly more forward
Saturn after the DNA Assebling
We weree at "Blood"
04I sent him an email and we did get a response back on hotel room info. We have the room from 6/29 - 7/1
:) sciences
:) good
^
04Just enjoy yourselves, but most importantly BE SAFE
04And that's all I have for me, for now.
get to know other ponies, maybe discover some possible partners
05(and take images, lots of images)
It's hilarious.
we wont be streaming it
04Oh, and uh, one other thing. Because I don't see it here...
04Streaming
but if the attendees want to do some sort of recording or something
then talk to the admins about it
Saturn: Sound desynched again...same as before
DAmn it! My stream is desynched =(
04Then I passed it over because I really don't see it
Epic
04But
http://bronysith.deviantart.com/art/brony-shirt-306102498?q=gallery%3Abronysith&qo=0
THE POWER OF BROFOOFS! /)
04Anyways, we're going to be redoing the streaming format for non-official streams
*Brohoofs
theres me in my shirt
oh Saturn
In "birthmarked", this desiase was ravaging in most of the population(its gentic; they needed more outsider breeding) well most of the wallled-in enclave
um no Saturn its a pic link man
well the one i poseted
I do not want to click that link given the kick description... >_>
08,01Bronysith: not you
Saturn: ooooh righto. tea?
:) I got my frist bronyshirt awhile ago
we are identical to fluttershy?
and then people said I can't wear it :(
Saturn: :o
O_O
dats horriblle
:]
Glad i missed that
Ponies R infectious
Show the Metropolis theme........
I'll go eat something.
OH DAT INTENSE FACE
SMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
time for the lecture on the enviorment
But at least it isnt compltetly blamming...MAN?!?!
04(There are still be discussed, but these are the infractions planned for now)
IT'S ALIVE!
It turned inside out and exploded. :O
Do I want to know why?
04Okay, NOW, that's all I have
for example: here you cant have gas canisters in the lab unless there is some apparatus on them.
Alright then.
11,01First infraction violation seems harsh.
:D
bye
^ nitt
13as is the requests get lost in SRS
1,11I think first and second infractions should be switched.
it's in that bottle
"Prehistoric earth-jizz"
Well that explains it.
^
waog
13the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
Hello everyone!
I think the larger issue with streaming etiquitte is that people do not ask for time to stream, and the current rules aren't being enforced
0,5They do
YES there could be
13these two conflict
HEELRO T\theSHHAS
13we have five minutes to wrap up or we have fifteen
O_O
0,5^I wondered that too
Hunters OHSHET
i'm not seeing a need for these to be hard rules right now, people vacate the stream when someone else shows up
wee also have Spitters, Hunters, Boomers, Smokers, and Tanks
:D
13[12:37] [+Shizuka] the infractions just make it sound like you don't trust us
04That's because we really want to cut down on frequently long streaming with people going on for hours and hours
1,11That's why I said to switch the 1st and second infractions.
04And we recognize that most people don't want to say anything to the person streaming
11,01They go on for hours when no-one else is streaming.
1,11If you can explain yourself the first time, it shows we trust you, but we're conserned about ettiquette.
11,02Infractions are the cold justice to breaking those rules. They are there to be fair for everyone, if you break them, you're not being fair to everyone else. As long as you follow those rules, you should be fine.
magics
11,01I've never known anyone to hog the stream.
09,01I mean
09,01if someone else is streaming
:3
11,01I'm not against infractions.
11,02That too
:)
13and nearly everyong has access to it
11,01Can we set up the stream sharing again?
11,01I don't.
Take a look! It's in a book! reading rainbow!
Furryeh Babieshs
FFFRRRRGHHH
13everyone does now
no more SCIENCES?
00,10In all honistly the infractions irk me. You want to issue punishments on somthing people do with there spare time as a service.
D:
11,01I looked there and couldn't find it.
1,11DCD, we all have it in us to tell someone to step down. We do it all the time for bans and such.
11,01I'll see again.
huh
Now onto literature, grammar and history :D
HISTORY?
TARDIS!
09,01I've seen it a ton of times, and I have experienced it myself
saturn
11,02Sumica: It's meant to be fair for everyone else. If we don't have them in place, then what's the repercusion for going over the limit?
Saturn, right?
:>
08,01i'm just asking the others if they want to take over
00,10we have had the time limit in place for months. no one uses it.
lol
09,01Sumica, that's the thing
Hide dem :(
04Nobody wants to tell someone else to stop streaming
09,01I know I certainly don't
OooooOOO!
09,01even if there are several times I should have, for all extents and purposes
00,10So we are punishing because we are nice. Great logic
Hm...Would that be falling into the public not wanting the certain stream to stop?
wat
dat music
11,01Found it!
LOL
13that too
13like i said we generally stay quiet cause what's on stream is awesome
dat intermission
still alive would fit with this
dat Shakespeare
Kill ALL the lawyers.
11,02^
Lol
lol
09,01and not go overboard
WHERE?
09,01I mean
OBJECTION
09,01let's face it
13skype group for streamers, and only for stream related things
the "Truth"
09,01when we are streaming, we DO tend to lose track of time
04^
/me contributes
Mhm.
<_< >_> DisApplle> Nothing is wrong!
DAT MUSIC!
kilaal mplayer?
Damn.
aww it ended
this seems really complicated
Now this just seems like a semi conscius skynet waking up :D
:D
Bans?
Skynet if skynet didn't want to rule the earth and just wanted to show you Cosmos.
COSMOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
09,01I mean
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
09,01are there any other ideas as to how to make sure we don't go overboard?
Since yer one of my fav. Mods
09,01much harder.
Scienes
;w; you both go away as soon as i was ready for my preshow
^
Rainbowdash- OBJECTION!
09,01that one time I asked you
09,01well, I asked you like two hours after I was supposed to, ya know
my fault
09,01it's hard, very hard, because you don't want to ruin other people's fun
08,01it seems that the times when i want to stream are the times when there are 2 or 3 queued
;)
this seems to be more of an issue of people not stepping up and asking than something that needs to be addressed with a full rules change
WAR!
yus!
Well I gotta go to work now. Bye Everypony!
i'd kinda prefer the former
omg
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME!
13k cutting that train here, val's segment discusses a streaming department, which my idea of a skype group falls under
sun eating moon?
13we are 40 minutes into the meeting, need to move on and soon
I need more nomz
04Listen, we can discuss this later
And the other one, which is ponies and...
04When Val is talking
04Guys
04Guys
crap I forgot the name
04Please
04We need to get underway
04We need to continue
0,5Thank you. -_-
04So
/me 08,01groans... "not more skype groups..."
I'm "I just woke up tired"
1,11We got the basics of that issue down. We can discuss it further later. Moving on to the next topic now.
needs more skype groups
05,15Okay two points here
00,02colour on!
/me sighs
11,02Please everyone, stay focused.
1,11I agree with Saturn. We don't need anymore skype groups. It's hard enough to keep up with the three we have as it is.
1,11sorry.
05,15Guys. I don't want to be rude but, it's my turn to speak
rub yer pony dolls all over him
bye everypony! :D
11,01MOVING ON
11,01Phase4: oH.
Bye!
00,02?
11,01Nvm.
CYa Val... DAmn.
OH DAMN
11,01I didn't see that everyone had calmed down. Sorry.
04Listen
if we want to organize a marathon, that's fine. Discuss it in the TL group and we'll get it rolling from there
04We'll discuss this *later* when Val mentions the streaming agin
04Please
04We need to move on
ok, i'm gonna come back later... :P
we already have -_-
Sure Saturn
soooooo........wazzap?
http://junker-kun.deviantart.com/art/Ponycraft-2-302517624?q=gallery%3Ajunker-kun&qo=1
=D
11,01Are we showing everything listed?
13not necessarily
11,01I thought at one point, you wanted to cut the list down.
Attempts were made to get the ball rolling on this, but I was told it was to wait until the meeting
1,11Well, as to HOW to make it work, it'd be no different from how BMN did the Lord of the Rings Salute to Summer trilogy event...
kamehameha
13it's not a definitive list, just the series we could think of in five minutes during the award show planning
marrrrrrrrrrrrssssssssssssssssss
*squeee*
13https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVKrxhQIDZLdDUwcGlpTG8wT3YzUGhPUlJxV0M4a2c#gid=0
Again? :D
No.
11,01Music with Vi?
1,11Yeah, there's plenty of music to play as well.
11,01Or pony games or games with pony mods?
/me afk
http://theshhas.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d528n5i
04You have to admit, we don't really do G4
11,01There are a lot of fan-made pony games out there.
04But I'm all for other pony things
00,02"Lord of the ring" i has all 3 on dvd :3
00,10been trying to slip in pmvs and such between eps of shows when I stream.
04*streamer
11,02Well, to be fair, I do usually stream a pony episode or two sometimes when I stream.
11,01I do pony videos sometimes.
00,02the desktop ponies seem to make it clear
13namely that people are sick of it by the end
08,01Ghosties: not all of us have ponies downloaded
04Not like a show, but just do something pony related
wat
04Doesn't have to be a show
08,01ah, okay
11,01Split the marathon.
13right
04I remember talking about doing like
11,01We should split the marathon.
11,01S1 one day. S2 the next.
04Just a Season 2 marathon leading up to S3
00,02how about 1 or 2 a day
Dude with his head in bull's...
04Because I honestly believe S1 and S2 would mean that people get sick of it
1,11Good point, Ghoties.
guys...this is really off-topic
1,11How?
if we want to do a marathon
04It's a part of flutter's topic
Lol :D
discuss it in TL after the meeting
04Pre S3 marathons
1,11We're talking about adding more ponies to the stream.
no one is against doing something
now we're just talking logistics
04But it's a part of his topic
brb
we don't need the entire team meeting to plan that out
04Pre S3 marathons
trilogy month
before s3
04It's just suggestions
08,01AND I FEEL FANTASTIC
1,11Exactly. We're just suggesting adding them due to the complaints that we aren't streaming enough of them.
Saturn: Gimme some.
Saturn: xD
1,11WHich is the topic.
00,024 am, need to go now
08,01Lil_B: i know
11,01Phase4: They're the same.
Saturn You should feel bad for everything (
back
1,11MOving on to Flutter's second topic, the trilogy streams...
00,02skim through when i wake up
11,01Pegasi are superior to all other races! =p
1,11When I was still around, I had some people discussing streaming tv series as well. Perhaps we could do something to sorta combine the two...or should that be reserved for the whole "queue streams" thing?
lol
Room is muted?
13https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVKrxhQIDZLdDUwcGlpTG8wT3YzUGhPUlJxV0M4a2c#gid=0
13claim one
13or add one
13we have more than enough to last the summer i'm sure
00,10not realy
13personally i'd rather make sure they're all claimed rather than set weeks for streaming them
wtf
13if they're all claimed then at the start of a week you can just volunteer to stream it
11,01Star trek 1-3. You mean Star Wars 1 - 3?
13i'm getting dragged away, won't be back for some time
hey guys
08,01i thought we'd already showed Band of Brothers?
08,01i remember someone streamed it
05,15That's for the July 4th event
1,11And we already did the LotR trilogy last year.
/me hugs Magical_pablez
04I honestly wanted to do LotR again at the end of the event
04Because tradition
And because Hobbit in December!
04That too
/me goes to eat
cya l8r
{
Oh Ptolemy, you ignorant slut
/me yawns loudly
good*
00,10did you want it over the mon-wen or over the weekend like last year?
CYA! :D
1,11If we're doing it again, then we do it right. The last weekend before school starts, remember? But that's a discussion for another time.
04Over the weekend is fine for me, for LotR
00,10oki
Hi everypony
04We can really get into getting this set up over the week, the trilogy thing I mean. But perhaps we should move on now
Okay, I think I'll go play some L4D2. See you... um... tommorow, I think?
04Scoot-Scootaloo
no music for me today :(
00,03Present
00,03Okay
08,01i drink way too much Mate
08,01i'm peeing like a racehorse all the time
08,01Carl Sagan's Cosmos
Okay, thank you
Saturn: .. does racehorses pee alot? o.o
Saturn: ou should just invest in a catheder.
08,01Airpuff: presumably
/me glomps Saturn
AYA
lol
i get no glomps?
D:
(yay O3O)
-_^
xD
wow.
I dilike being the topic. Be back in roughly an hour.
11,01So, details?
11,01Honestly, I didn't hear about them until shortly before our interview.
0,5I remember taking part in the interview with Everypony sings, and they're great people. I wouldnt object to a partnership at all.
cool
1,11and if that's the case, I think this is a good idea.
:p
00,03Brony musicians used their work for their music at one point. 
11,01So they need to popularity boost.
08,01yet another example of the "oh, me too!" side of the fandom...
That's like the sixth yawn...
04We could possibly set up some kind of meeting with them later
inb4 comments saying "boobs"
00,03I think I can arrange that
There it is.
04Next?
00,03Okay then,
xD
1,11Alright. Well until we get that meeting, this topic's done with. Who's next.
00,03I think I still am
04Scoot still
04New members or something
0,5^
04How many do you have now?
00,03And we have 8 people myself included
11,01Uh oh.
11,01Some are inactive.
0,5*pinkie pie trombone*
lol
Oh dear...
usual I see
lol
11,02Please keep focused LC
11,01AV has more of a communication problem than a lack of manpower IMO.
we can hire more people if there's a reason to, but right now we've got a lot of members. If people aren't doing their jobs, then we might have to reconsider their positions here
1,11A/V?
11,01But that issue is for later.
0,5There he is.
00,03Sorry, laptop being a jerk:/
lol kepler
Kepler... Oh You :3
00,03So yeah, floors open again
:D
11,01Audio/Visual
If there's justification for hiring someone, bring it to the admins and we'll discuss it (like with Valcron)
part of the issue with manpower is people spreading themselves thin, I'm looking at the list and I see a few people in multiple depts
otherwise, the departments need to get their act together
and then someone discovered the other planets AND CRUSHED HIS BELEIVES!
2Wait, didn't the third one just come out
lol
omg
if people aren't going to do their jobs, then they don't belong on the team. I know it's harsh, but that's just how it is
I'm back......again.......for the 3rd time this week.....
04Kirz brings up a good point, perhaps there should only be one person in one department?
yes
04Er
04One person should just stick to one department ><
No.
11,01That'll work because we have zero posted interviews because most are unedited.
0,5Why just one department?
Again, man.
SHE BLINDED ME WITH SINCENCE!
fail
00,03Silver, I'm gonna need to talk to you after this meeting
0,5Some people are able to handle it.
If you spread yourself too thin, you're not going to be effective.
1,11Interviews? Shit, i'm in the middle of doing a DOCUMENTARY with 2 interviews on a local busienss. I could get those done in a week.
VIVE REVOULUTION!
REVOLUTION
11,01I'll have to quit interviews or step down from gaming dept lead if we have to stick to one dept.
Heresy!
04Then, like Val said, perhaps we should be looking to do some rearranging with the members themselves
05,15Yes LC however they'll be able to concentrate on that one department more.
04It's not lack of members
/me drinks some jack daniels
drocsid
/me revolts
^
04Now I understand that there are circumstances
04I get that
04I know what's going on, but shit luck or not it's not lack of members
04It's motivation
04Getting it done
1,11It's lack of willpower and getting it DONE.
04Like Val said
Doesnt matter, had lol.
04You are on the team, you should be contributing to the team if you're on it
The point is
1,11In my case, I'd do it just because I could always use the freelance work and practice for my career.
/me closes her eyes slowly
04It's kinda discouraging
shleeeeeeep
if there is this feeling that the teams have too much workload or whatnot
bring it up in the TL group
again, use that group more often

COMMUNICATION is magic
Hooplah.
sleepy*
yes
it's just a rumor at this point
ALL the mods!
/me hugs Luna

/me 07,01snugs Rain
11,01Timely communication.
:)
u know u wanna
Luna: <3
/me is half asleep
Afternoon all...
LOL YOU TWO RETURN AT THE SAME TIME XD
just as you went away at the same time earlier
07,01busy dear, i'll talk to you in a bit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_3#Potential_sequel
ok then ^_^
Hello Luna :)
/me jumps
Kepler is depress.
FUN MATHEMATICS? HOW DARE THEY, said Kepler-
13I swear
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4560/
2The word 'sequel' has lost a lot of its appeal pertaining to movies lately :<
omg
He choked on a hunk of ham.

http://bronysith.deviantart.com/
11,01Confound this insomia, it drives me to ponies.
00,03But we still have to worry about what's going on in our own time. Some of us do half to deal with personal issues that they can't focus all their time on BS
that's fine and all
as long as you communicate
and can work around it
NO!@
The only time it's a problem is when someone says they'll do something, and then does nothing for a month
not now
04I'm not sure how to result this topic
take some SPOIL THEN SOME TURD AND STACK ,A SPOIL TURD STACK XD
*phew*
:D
04Because I'll be honest
the: hi
Hello the shortest name I've seen in a while.
PIERCE THE HEAVENS
That feeling when you realise you have mathexams the next day 6_9
is there anything on the stream
00,03I think this goes hand in hand with communication. We should be able to elaborate on it on later topics.
04Communication
Supa zoom.
04If you don't talk
04We don't know
communication more or less is the main item for this entire meeting
12Pixar sequels
Orbits are Elippses and Kepler could not except it
12fff yeah
it keeps returning
dat feeling when u dont lsten to music.........
When is this movie over? :(
Dropping hints probably isn't a good idea either. And yes.
1,11We keep talking about it, but how do we fix it?
11,01Funny how communication is my only topic.
11,01And it's at the end.
04Like I said, it was being considered cutting people from teams
1,11Here's how:
04But everybody is against that
0,5Because, Ty...
AKA orbit
1,11IF there's an issue, tell someone about it.
0,5Even if the problem isnt numbers
1,11It's people.
04It's the motivation
*Facedesk*
04You are in the group
0,5If they are removed, then there is less potential
04You are there to participate, guys...
04If you're just there
12!pokemon
The area of each is always the same.
04And not doing anything...
1,11It's not potential if they don't do the work.
04^
04^
04If you're just there, and you don't do anything
04Then yeah
when does season 3 come
04Just anything, please
when does season 3 come
04That's all I'm asking for
04Give us something to work with
lol
the: Fall
the this year
never
11,01I'll bring up my concerns at my time.
NEVA
when does season 3 come
if there's an issue
say it
the: Fall
/me is steamed
Whenever I pay attention to this show I feel like I'm looking at the TARDIS.
the: eventually
we can't do anything if we don't know
the: never, they cancelled it
arggggggggg
hello
arggggggggg
I heard it's gonna be in the fall
arggggggggg
where am i?
arggggggggg
13!pokemon
dA/dT=dY/dT
arggggggggg
13!touhou
1,11Right.
00,03That being said, I think I'm done with my topic.
04Alright
Alright
Ok.
04TALK MORE
arggggggggg
04Next?
the: Why do you keep posting the same thing 3 times?
00,03Don't be a Fluttershy!
moi
arggggggggg
dat arg spam
04Ah, Luna
1,11oh, sorry.
don't worry
04Luna is next
"Knock knock!"
1,11Luna, you're up.
.... anyone? :'(
The candles they light up nothing!
Dis coooooood
did the dr leave?
gaming > live games
omg
really? never seen any
oh shit
Audio > podcasts / interview playlist
yeah for ps3
sure it did
brb
it sure did buddy
it sure did
well that was quite jolly good
Why didn't they just make loads of candles?
./discuss
:$
wat
(that was point 1)
11,01Separate, simultaneous streams?
And she sold drugs.
yes
/me stays on equestria
it is Luna, we've actually had this discussion before
he visited luna
00,03^
lol
omg
Maybe we can use LiveStream for streams like that? Like links to the LiveStream place
i heard celestia
^
^
could open up a side room if needed, we have 6 extra
1,11We don't need separate streams to show diffent forms of content. the beauty of streaming electronic media is that it can be any media. We have discussed this before, and the answer has been "now."
04How many streams are we thinking, though
1,11no*
rescue luna!
05no more livestream usage unless its a must
04But I do agree with themed streaming, and a page for each department
05soon we wont even be able to use it
not yet, give a minuet
04At least a page for each department
personally, I dislike the idea of having streamers competing for viewer attention, with that being said: I'd like to see everyone's opinion on it
1,11Livestream pretty much loaths us at this point.
04Hehe
00,03I'm afraid that it would mean competition
1,11^
I think having 1 extra page would work, but use it strictly for dept streams
why is everypony pinging me?
05,15I'm not sure about streams. But a page for each department seems like a great idea, and for things like the gaming and podcast pages, you could just have recordings.
I just heard thunder
Storms a comin
dat epic music
1,11...
I'm falling asleep!!!!!
...That's an idea...
Mine ISNT WORKINg :(
I'm getting no stream O__o
1,11A collection of Let's Plays, Podcasts, Music all promoting different artists through playlists that link to their respective pages.
yes yes i am
the stream dried up
Credits for credits?
04Wait
Starting one?
We already have one
1,11Ghosties: I think that's the idea we're getting at.
Ba ba ba ba she she she she ba ba ba ba :P
blood hoofs are scary
hey Saturn can I recommend something?
/me eats DISCORD's zombies
/me kills all the zombies
04^
yummy
1,11^
04Have separate playlists for each channel
04For each dept, I mean
*Flys away from DISCORD*
That's it, I'm done.
08,01thanks for watching
Good night.
Thanks for streaming Saturn. :3
Bye-bye Saturn.
Thanks, Saturn!
1,11We don't discriminate either. If someone has something they want to add to the "Music" playlist or the "Let's Play" playlist, we let them add it.
gratzi, Saturn
bye Saturn
Thanks for strea Saturn
Thanks Saturn
thx Saturn bye!
Thanks for thr stream Saturn :)
05,15That's how my personal page is, I have tons of playlists sorting my favorites and uploads
thx for the stream :D
^
that's a possibility
08,01if i had time, i'd do another Saturn Explains Shit, but i'm up to my eyeballs in work right now
Bye Saturn! :D
Vi's radio stream was another possibility
we link to our dA page each week...
05,15Lit could have fanfic readings or reviews. Every department has something they could add
Saturn: Go raibh maith agat for the stream!
it's just not being UTILIZED at all
1,11The radio stream could feature the playlists if VI is willing.
...We have a deviantART page?
Hai everypony!
Saturn: :o
lol..
say wut
11,01We also have an unused tumblr.
...
we have both
It's actually getting worked on Nitt
11,01OK.
11,01K.
04Alright, we're veering off
0,5And yea Luna
00,10Guess I was the only one that liked the idea luna had.
BRB
05,15I say yes to individual pages, but I'm hesitant on the streams.
it's just a crazy idea
but we can discuss the details later
just needed to know if you like it or not
04Yeah
00,10*headdesk*
only 97 more views until my DA account has reached 1,000 channel veiws :$
04I'm also hesitant to streams
00,10a meeting to plan meetings
11,01Me too.
14the pope is gone
14FINALLY
14too many people around x_x
the tech part or the setup or the managing?
I
each department would be in charge of their own channel
14over a milion
and then tech makes the magic happen
brb
each dept lead would be responsible for managing the page, with help from tech to set it up
^
this is not a democracy.
we are an anarcho-synd.... no, wait, I suppose we're not that either
anyone care to play gmod sbep? Gmod SBEP anyone?
05,15no a playlist in the main channel
Oo
dat feeling when u eat all ur chips and u have no music and u got owned in one in the chaber after beating everyone up..........
tumblr
!help
back
*angry face*
Back. With an apple. But fruit is still EVIL! :O
Now, I really do need my bath. :D
04Okay
04So
Y'know
1,11That said, We can move on to our next topic.
04Hold on
04Themed Streaming: Not sure, hesitant
04Page for departments on site: Sure
any1 here plays or has played lineage 2?
04Okay
04Now we can continue
only for curiosity
next item is a simple one
Artist's Spotlight Page; What's the status on bringing back our Artist's Spotlight page?
04NEVER
04Er
/me is looking at the techies
*ahem*
04I think Val worked on that too
It was a topic of mine, yes
Und then Chickens which Scooted.
they make lemonade
Yeah
Which is Pretty fucking awesome
I remember making lemonade with the boy scouts
You mean girl scouts.
O U
yes
Besides, Girl Scouts are called Guides :P
that, and the fanfic contest
the only thing I hate about lemonade is that it burns my throat afterwords :p
I did not know that.
Consider me enlightened.
00,03...wut
that you are
:$
00,03Che!
I liked Greenday, back when they were sorta newish.
well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
00,03And yes, BlameTruth is awesome~
05kind of developing the spotlight a bit further
11,02Moooooo
Coke > Lemonade.
Oink
11,02I'm not going to be streaming right now
pretty much wat EqD is doing?
04"LOL, UR JUST COPYING US"
Its like the taco of lemonades
/me works on his Abraham Tank
05same can be done with fanfics, music.
Hey, mods! :$
04At least for now
00,03OH HAI!
Oh right.
pibg
11,02Lil_B: Probably not a countdown... ><
*ping
1,11The submission process would be simple and the rules easy to follow: Keep it clean and tasteful.
00,03A password for you nickname
Scwoop!
11,01I dunno. I don't go there much anymore myself.
^
Stay on topic plz
11,02Lil_B: If you ask me, I can tell you how much longer :)
05who cares about their standards?
1,11Moving on.
I don't
04True, but this can be brought up during discussion about Bronynation
I registered it
ok, thats 0:00 in germany i think
1,11All three.
Right next item
Forum utilization
you face
mythbuster
Why are the forums barely being used?
wee it works ;D
He has wars to lose.
UR FACE
04"Too much work"
05skype.
00,03^
04Or Skype, yeah
Whos streaming?
11,01Pretty much Skype.
11,02O.O
*Explodes*
oh
*Explodes*
04For now, Skype is just easier to communicate
11,01Same,.
WHOAH
04So if you really want forums utilized then that means we ask others to go to forums more
WHOA
04But then
later today on mythbusters: http://theartrix.deviantart.com/art/Today-on-Mythbusters-ponies-200939257
/me rolls on the floor
04That probably wouldn't happen :/
11,02Rain`: 6 PM PDT Monday June 4th :)
Doppler Effect?
^_^
E3. Meh.
Well, Skype might be easier.
Because clearly our communication is terrible.
inb4 it does
As that comes up time and time again
The Situation Room
Da Fuhrer.
*dad
In de Fuhrers face.
11,01Or to post movie night winners.
/me rolls in a circle on the floor
11,02O.O
05aye
*Rolls on floor and hums*
well my dads girlfriend is intrested in seeing the show
chat*
/me crashes through wall
But I don't think it was used much
OHHH YEAH!!
04Yep
SLAP
bitchslap
04It's not used much
04So then
Maybe we should reinforce the use of something like that
Ow.
04Have a SRS SRS group
SLAP FIGHT
/me explodes from slap
I regret wondering.
druuuugs
no
not another group
1,11No more skype groups.
1,11No. More.
0,5To be honest I prefer skype over the forums
i like her painted on tie
Most of us live in different time zones.
04Everyone probably does
11,02:<
11,01More skype groups are bad.
*SLAPS EVERYPONY*
We need somewhere where we can read goings on without all the crap
/me slaps the RPers around a bit with a large trout
11,01We don't need a SRS for SRS.
1,11Exactly.
also
As we used to have
Which is updated with the daily events
The RP is very annoying.
And which everyone should read/update
/me is slapped
05assign someone to post the daily list?
Tell them that she secretly had an affair.
honestly whats the point of RP?
is slapped :'(
That'll work.
the RP is incredibly annoying
just be yourself man?
Keri can bust my myth anytime.
I dunno...
/me 11,01feels like +m ing the channel for RP
they are building a slapping machine?
The amount of which I am annoyed is too damn high.
*Hugs alexxm* It's ok :)
Hmm
Hairy arms.
Dem soundeffects.
O_O KARI'S GETTING SHAVED
Is anyone else getting some random YTP and buffering moments?
Dat pun
11,01I don't mind one-line things.
Slap the bass.
I can't believe we're finally here.With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is starting to make this the Best Night Ever!
I think there's a problem with the stream.
Spank-o-meter
Is that homer simpson?
11,01Or two-line.
04How about
11,02I'm good ^-^
11,01/me isn't RP. /me interactions are.
Bam hands.
It's either randomly buffering or jumps a few seconds ahead
2!pokemon
2!eonget
4Ran just got a male 2Glaceon
oooh this slap is PAINFUL
2:3
Smack.
horray
04Keep using SRS, but use the forums for the most important info and direct everyone there for the finale of a discussion
rofl
dem slap
04That way both SRS and the forums are used
Backhand
1,11Exactly.
i like this show
11,01K.
I need that for an alarm clock
04OKAY, next
If this is going to work we need to be pretty strict with checking/posting information to the forums though
1,11If thats the case, we should be using it to record the decisions we're making right now.
Dey gon' get drunk?
Now increase the force to match a crocodile bite. :3
Their pain is amusing.
BOOM oh no
lol
That hand acts more like a fish, than an actual hand
advert why is there an advert
Commercials? NOOOOOOOOO
04So that way it's easier to go back and just pick the result of each topic
I'm guessing this is being streamed from the T
uh oh
*TV
are we watching tv?
Alright last point
05wait
thast over 90!!
05luna
051 last thign
It
/me cries
go ahead
It
LASER! :D
04Then users would be asking to join
/me 11,01slaps everyone with a wet towel.
It's also annoying as fuck.
Fun Fact: The highest recorded psi in a human's bite is multiple times higher than the strongest bite recorded on a shark bite.
*Hugs alexxm*
the forums as they are now are only meant for the team
1,11Yeah, that's a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idea.
08,01weren't we going to include public forums as part of BS2.0?
Painful and refreshing
that ad seems legit
D'as one dumb dude.
we have a item for that later
05we were iirc
05ok lets wait with that discussion then
TODO:
need to update overview sheet...
need to update rules
need to update infraction document
update FAQ with summer newsletter info
Just need folks for this to step up and do it

It's also annoying as fuck.
05what is the overwiew sheet?
department overview sheet..
00,10oh you all just realised this was live tv?
inb4 he dies painfully.
oooh dis is gunna be gud
00,10new to me
I made someone bleed by whipping him with a wet towel once
05Updating the rules seems like a team job aswell. I could help with that.
Scale room with a scale explosion. Now that is pretty cool.
00,10capture card
I NEED FOOOOOD
BRB
05,15Yeah the FAQ is no problem.
04I don't want to leave out those that were there last time
brb
04And we're both admins
04In fact
04I'm the leader of the Rules group
04So I *have* to be there
00,10mine is some where in the middle
05,15I was about to say, don't we have a Rules group in skype?
04OH YEAH
04We do
HOPEFULLY
11,01I was in the rules group on Skype.
04We have a rules group
Bamf.
Alright that's all for my items.
1,11Since the two kind go hoof-in-hand.
That explosion matched the explosion in my head when my mind was blown.
transducer
05if she wants to that is
doink!
05always this ^
/me has a tower of beer cans in his room
drama data
DOINK
04So then the Rules Group would handle updating the rules, I'll make an appointment tonight
with cukis
04May we move on, Luna?
05as i feel right now i feel like begining tonight even, we shall se.
This'll be fun.
04Do tomorrow at noon
05okiloki
04Luna?
11,01If it's cheap, I could get one to stream PS3 games.
yea lord celestia is next
04Alright
1,11LC, you're up.
they should make a catch and make the person sitting press a release button. :D
0,5Alrighty
man, american adverts...
04There
U
11,01Nittany Tiger
A
11,01My PS3 is broke.
oh
11,01So if you add me, don't expect to be added for a while.
11,01I know.
I'm back.
I'm front.
i'm middle
11,01I have the first.
04I had an idea for that
oh cool, live TV
0,5willing to watch over other sites like twitter, ponysquare, etc.
05HOLY F. ok reading.
03=.=
0,5This could make social media management a lot easier I believe.
Aerosmith AND Run DMC version? NICE!
Shepard.
I have PSN
Mythbusters? AW YEAH! :D
I'm barely ever on the PS3 though
My names crazzytus on it though, if any of you want to add me.
0,5PR ?
inb4 drunk
1,11Public Relations.
0,5Ah
Dat stock knuckle crack
1,11Hell no.
0,14I'm behind this idea, I made a mention of something like this last meeting and on the forum post for this meeting
1,11This could easily be resolved by talking in SRS
04No, it can't
dem stars
That's odd, i've got my TV set to Discovery Channel right now, but this episode isn't what's on
No, it would need another skype group
04And PR is crucial
05,15yeah, I agree, PR is really important and it would make sense to have a team for it.
04It's just a dedication to communication is needed
0,14the Skupe group would only be for the people in that department right?
oh wow......
He's asian... Of course he's good at math.
dat math....
00,03It really is important to have one, since we need dedicated people on it
11,01Agreed.
Frosty.
chilly
inb4 they forget him.
Shiver his timbers?
And he was never seen again.
04I've been keen on it for a while

LOL :D
DOHOHOHOHO
CFFFFFFFFFFFF
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Results are, you suck.

Uhhg, this channel is turning into the "Look how expensive this is, and stupid activities channel"
Glad they got rid of the supermannians. Those things were creepy as fuck IRL
THX 4 the help
0,5Well,
it is, the one and only
IKR?
1,11PR is mainly getting people interested in what's going on.
events and contests are things teamleaders should be discussing in the TL group
Is this just Discovery Channel, or is it one of it's alternate ones?
0,5Uh
since it involves multiple departments
http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d529j85 o_O
0,5Like I said:
05i think they would in first hadn focus on spreading already planned events
XD
05but everyone can come with ideas
1,11We spread the word, get people invested, bring them in. That's it.
05jsut as before
Its now known as the hub.
0,5Tumblr workers would be in the group, and whoever runs the dA, and whoever is willing to run other soial media sites.
http://flarechaser.deviantart.com/#/d524cn1 o_O D:
OOH! SICK BURN!

Isn't a hynemen the part of the female reproductive system that rips and bleeds the first time she has sex?
Mods are asleep, post pon-oh wait.
xD
Ponies are asleep, post mods
0,5One more thing I want to mention: The people in this department would need to be members of at least a few of our social media sites, or have one or two people assigned to a specific site, and then have them work on it / manage it, which I meant to say earlier.
Trolololol
/me takes out GilDash's eyes, rubs them on his shirt and puts them back in. "Can you see now?"
Vaginas are asleep, post vaginas

stream etiquette
-_________- My whale is bigger.
I wanted to bring this to attention
/me hugs everypony :3
hehehe go cameraman
it's vital that we always give respect to our streamers
xD
Well this seems safe.
inb4 911.
does anyone have any comments to add to that, if not, I can move on?
the blue screen of doom?
=0
yes.
XD
..... ._.
Alright, 5 more minutes and I'm offline.
05ok no furtehr from me regarding that
jeward?
because it's distracting and disrespectful
not yet, ill tell you when
I must work.
alrighty, any other questions/concerns?
In maybe 10 Minutes.
http://eddmario.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d4ncci9
11,01Stuff related to the stream is OK, though?
of course
11,01And if the streamer allows it?
you know
1,11It was related to the stream, but kinda distracting.
brb time for moar food
supersora dont we always?
MAIBEH.
11,01But I understand purposely drawing attention away.
Fucking pedostache.
Hi, Good afternoon everyone
heya TGAPT
brb
okay- anything else regarding this?
No Hitlers, kay.
Now stop
hatin is bad
00,10think of it as off site advertising and posting videos, ask the streamer first
Now I need some freaking burgers...
Hilters are unneeded. if you are a hilter U MUST DIE
Literally.
*is hungry now*
We're slow-cooking NC Style Barbecue tonight.
alright, moving on
/me walks away
out of this.
00,10this should be good.
11,01Details of BronyNation.
11,01?
sure
boom
BOOM
**I mean music.
Supersora "Roxas the master"
they would post it on BronyNation
Where? on DA?
Ikr.
Rest of planet goes FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
i made a pony gif. this is my first try http://theshhas.deviantart.com/art/First-Try-gif-306144851
00,10lol the roof poping off.
boom
04Wait
04Hold on
0,14how close would the integration be?
Roof must go, his planet needs him.
Two guys, one garage...
00,03I assume this would take a long time
Aerosmith and Run DMC - Walk This Way
04Because BN is going to take a while
04But for now, like Val has mentioned, it's to discuss where BN is going
EEEEVERYONE does.
.....
Ty...
if you read the pastebin
04I read it
11,01Where it's going is up to who's in the know.
....hmmm..
developers for web do not count, they have to live with IE by choice
04And I read over Slurry's too
you'll see we combined Slurry's BN thing with mine
wern't you kicked?
04But Slurry's BN comes later
04Unless you want to shift his to be the first thing that comes up
1,11Guys, relax.
I don't understand American adverts ._.
Jackle: Alright. Off of the computer. No more r34 for you. We need to get starting.
lol
I mean.
Goodbye.
Nittany in the stream with the banhammer.
I need to please.
11,01Lol.
*leave
well, there's no sense in dividing the topic into pieces
05so we shouldnt post our thoughts?
we should just get it all out now
why can't brian blessed do this advery
CREDIT WIPEOUT
Let's just discuss it now, since Val's already on that topic
L4D2 was released about 3-4 years ago!
..........
shocked
glaze is a mare?
AIR DELIGHT LOOKS FUCKING GOOD
It's like an American Aero!
how does she...... the voice..........
Wut
http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d529qsd
DAT2 1MP0SS13BLE!
okay, first and foremost
thoughts, put them here
now
mythbusters!:D
lol
Nittany: I thinks this is getting old.
Oooh...
i'm truely surprised...
0,5Uhm
A slap to the face can mean jailtime for domestic violence.
00,10new ep is like 8 hours from now
guess i'm running my battery down to 0 power
1,11Yes.
yes
00,10I have no clue if I would even have the stream then
08,01and not just a host, but above that too
Leave it be.
0,5^
08,01with critiques and advice from experieneced creators
it's possible i might gain access to an outlet in like half an hour but not sure yet
SMACK EM HAAAAARD
http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d5294o6
Great after slap face
Shits gone down.
Busted
I need to leave too.
00,03Sure you do~
11,01That was one thing I was wondering.
BYE EVERYPONY!!!
I'm fairly sure all of us want to know the answer.
Told ya.
Slap.
he left
Bye
Confir- confir-med.
08,01i'd reckon we'd keep it running, but try and keep it as separate from BN as we can
Yes..
lol
08,01to avoid potential legal issues
11,01I think this was a topic during the last meeting.
11,01Yeah.
11,01But we'll need more people to run both sites.
i do*
to clarify
...
we fully recognize BN is something very far away
in addition
/me has a tower of beer cans in his romm
/me has a tower of beer cans in his room
this is why we're making partnerships with other sites, like 20% cooler
0,14again, how close would the integration be? would all the sites be merging into one or would we all carry a certain banner?
It's Rarity! ANd it's the winky face!
ded
Would make for a pretty cool beer cozy
Yes! Mythbusters!
"Weve exposed the creamy center" Reminds me of ghostbusters. :3

Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeg
WHA?!
I'm pretty sure the flames would kill anyone
Still have 3 slots for the L4D2 versus... somebody interrested?
BULLSHIT!
Yes, because every hobo has a plane ticket to the United Kingdom.

Oh... The credits...
If they collapsed the bunker...
1,11The difference between us and other icons, though, is that we keep a connection to the community AS A WHOLE. We con't discriminate, we don't put ourselves above them, we don't let personal ideas and affections get in the way, we don't put them down because we don't agree on an opinion. We treat them equally.
Everything needs more explosives
Like the stream.
no. "You COULD have survived" not "WOULD have."
lol
11,01We need to always do that.
you are
Dat expertise.
if the team is good with it, then we're going to make them
we have a skype group for BronyNation
08,01shouldn't that in itself be a milestone/deadline, val?
they are looking at a male bag
Hitler's voice tops at 200 decibals. I think his ears can stand an explosion...
hi
that's why it's on the team meeting topic
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-derpy-is-not-amused.png
come on guys
that's why I want everyone's thoughts now
2 SLOTS FOR L4D2
Oh, ok
0,14for me, it depends on how closely the potential sites are integrated
Why must Kari Byron be married, whyyyy
Derpy brought them letters!
that's why I'm prodding us now, because Luna and I are sick of it not going anywhere
think of it this way Saxy:
I like being surrounded by male... Mmmmm.
11,01Chrysalis: Wut?
anyone for L4D2? we have 2 slots open :3
BN is a hub site, which connects and links to all the participants of BN
I think
I think we should really get planning going. We have the idea, let's get the ball at least moving somewhat. Whoever wants to help with this should be in that group and help out with ideas and plans, etc. no?
want to join us for som l4d2
11,01I'm busy.
you know you want to
awwww
lol

HHURRRG all the mods are busy!
alright, are there any opposed to BN?
any concerns?
Man, these guys have one of the best jobs
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/311/691/8be.jpg I assume most of you'd like this.
0,14I'm still wary of this
05i have mentioned my concerts and thoughts.
*perks up* Did somebody say DOYLE?
Mythbuster gon bust.
0,14from my personal experience, too much merging kills communities
11,01BN is a good idea. We'll just need to prepare to hire more people down the line.
Ew ew ew
04We're not sure if it's going to be a hub site or a merging
04We don't know
CINEMON CHALLENGE?
RustyMeat...dude drop the idea
No comment.
13too bad webrings were lame in the 1990s
oh dear
00,10Sure seems to be alot of outsidelinking going on.
It works idiot.
0,14if it's a hub site like Val's saying, where we're connected, but still functionally seperate, I can jive with that
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I've done cinnamon without a problem. :)
XD
04But as for us, for BronyState's team, I've talked it over with a few TLs and we thought about possibly just passing along work to the team members for those that want to be involved in BronyNation but would rather work on it then just plan for it
:o
She needs an exorcist!
lol
XD
Cinnimon challange? Try the Kool Aid challange.
dat exhale
Ow ow ow
XD
You down 5 spoonfulls of pure kool aid powder
I've done that once. never again xDD
04And like Slurry said, it really feels like there's a split and we're going to make decisions soon
O_O
No. :3
XD
is there ANYONE opposed to this idea?
Eeeeeeeeeeeeew
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDDDDD
04Unless they want to just work and not be involved in the group
eeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww
11,01We just don't need to spread ourselves thing.
But why?!
start off with a little
Needs to be about 20% something-er
04I must confess, this isn't something that can be just talked about, since there are members on the team that are still opposed
11,01*thin
cmon lad!
00,10like a baws
^
04How would you address that, Val?
HE DID IT.
1,11May I say something about this?
bawsliek
YYYEEAAAAAHH
O_o
as for spreading ourselves too thin
Is this the cinnamon challenge????????????
He starts coughing up blood
this is why we're joining with other sites
LIKE A BAWS
I meant beard.
BronyNation is something else
/me eats Airpuff's spoonful of cinnamon.
hello?
Grow a beard.
Hey everone! :)
everyone*
hey Acleps
Hye hey hey Acleps :)
lol
One time, I was on a plane, and I still had connection to this website. I was like. :O :) :O :)
;)
04Silver?
Dat Totally random team
>.>
XD
04It seems most of the newer members are against while the older members are for
Eric Hanson? I know that name.
00,10a part of the whole
He likes guro :D
boom!
BOOM
04We don't know that, Val
04We don't know how BN is gonna work out
See *affiliate* I don't think BS is going anywhere.
04The only thing we've really done is just discuss the possibility of "what could be"
11,01Seems BN needs more planning.
i'm good CCP
11,01A lot more.
yes
yes
05SaxyPretender: good. cause since BS inst compromised by BN, that shouldnt be a problem
exactly
05isnt*
Ty, we've ALWAYS said that BS would be its own thing
04And this is why things have stagnated, because others on the team are against and I'd like everyone to move forward with us
that's why we need everyone to help out and make it work
Ow.
Next time on mythbusters: Are atomic bombs as fun to blow up as the media says? *Atomic exlposion*... Yes. Yes they are.
05,15Yeah if BN doesn't affect BS then I'm perfectly fine with it
never once have we even remotely discussed the possibility of evolving it like that
Ow ow ow.
12!pokemon
04I was there for the opening discussion
oooooooowwwwwwww

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS-KVpZ9mrQ
11,01I'm not for or against BN. It just needs planning because it appears that there isn't any. It's just an idea.
Wait.... This is live TV?
1,11...
2!pokemon

Listen to me

oh my
with or without us

04Luna's right
04Either you're for this or you're not
I'm back! :)
dang typo
1,11I've said it at least three times.
11,01I'm fine with BN then.
11,01I'm not against it.
e_e I belive a retreat is in order.
yes
05so far i havent seen anyone
o.o
nice ecco!
Nick, you are a 6Geodude.
.....................................
11,01Shizuka was during the last meeting.
You know what's weird?
11,01That's the only person I know.
05why?
13i'll go with it if we have a plan
same
11,01A plan and good communication.
08,01i'm for it, but i think that as it stands, it's a load of hot air with no plan of action. the ball need to start rolling.
0,14if it's a hub site/overall banner, then I'd be okay with it
05and then presented it
Hunh?
13but there has to be some kind of plan or else we're throwing effort at something that might not amount to anything
05we can have anotehr revision?
But I'll explain, Acleps.
04So with that said
13yeah a hub with banner could work, like a "part of the BronyNation network" kind of thing
honestly that's how I always envisioned it
04It looks like we're gonna be doing another meeting with the rest of the people involved with BronyNation
Acleps: Holla! :)
Oh, no... Deadliest Catch is back.
05did no one hear me?
04It could very well be a hub...who knows
/me hugs Acleps.
So,what are we watching? :)
Bye everypony
experts
05,15Exactly like I said TGWTG is a good model for that.
04To discuss the next step
we'll draw something out
and then present it to you all
is that good?
yesh
0,14good enough for me
/me 11,01likes normal Luna
Luna: Ping :P
lol
suddenly beard
hi Luna
/me hugs Luna and brushes her mane
11,01Good thought.
/me 2rolls Nick down a hill
11,01I'm for it.
good, now we can move on
1,11"Please help plan, get the ball rolling, and get the idea cemented."
2:3
lol
alright, resource management
1,11Am I just being ignored? WE have a plan to start it, we have an idea, and we know how to execute it for the time being until the next meeting.
05that made no sense. are you asking us to present out talents?
/me 07,01murrs softly
Woooooooooooooooooona
no
/me hugs Luna
we're asking you to tell us if you feel you aren't beind used properly
04If we don't look where we're going we're going to hit a wall
By that logic its silly to call roasted bread a toast and not bread...
and now... i'm finally back!
TOAST
since people may not want to come forward this publicly
my little mythbusters: explosins are magic
I'll leave it at this:
all toasters toast toast
The admins are in charge of organizing everything. If you don't like how the organization is going, TELL US
and we'll do something about it
:33
okay, good, moving on
poof o.o
we already worked on BN.. BS was a roadmap to eventually BN
Terms of Service. Yes or No? If we're okay with this idea, then we'll go forward with it. I'll assemble a group and whatnot. Any concerns about it?
acetylene
I actually would like to see some responses on resource management
