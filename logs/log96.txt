I like her because she had a strong hand in the weather.
But Newgate, that applies to every pony in the show? :0
The statue that she broke when she was trying to keep it from falling on everyone else?
That's not on her.
yes, FF
None have any unredeemed mistakes. :0
the statue still broke
She brought it down
That's the nature of the show.

No, I don't disagree
But why 1000 years? :0
Yeah.
it was meant to be eternity
wait, is Barry right?
It wasn't, otherwise there would be no tales of when she'd reappear in 1000 years
The reality is, it pisses me off that Luna apologized, but Celestia didn't
In fact, she acted like she forgave LUna, and did nothing wrong
If you watched episode one, you'd know it was meant to be eternity
Or was it?
OSHIT
AWW CRAP
Or at least know about it and allow it to happen.
knew*
There were four stars travelling toward the moon throughout the night during the episode
It was prophecy.
Because she KNEW it was going to happen.
For certain.
To be quite honest
Barry: that's an unreliable story Twilight read, though.
or perhaps the prophecy was made by an ancestor of Pinkie's.
SHE'S DIGGIN' UP THE COWNCAL ROWD
Barry: it doesn't even know the princesses's names.
UH OH
0Stop that bitch
It's not the book that doesn't know, but the writer
Everyone dun be gone

BOB'S GONE

I'm hoping we explore that more in S2
HERE'S JOHHNY!
All the various fanfic explanations are awesome, but I'd like to see a canon explanation.
0Tackle her
There's no explanation needed.
Luna went evil.

Celestia trapped her for a while instead of killing her.

Mind putting a word in for us?
oh
People asking about anyone live streaming S2
i g2 join group first :P
And none of the mods are able to at the moment. XD
like no one ever was
how would one go about doing such a feat?
Just say that we'll be livestreaming the episodes as they air, maybe drop the site name, though that could change as we get a domain.
maybe drop the site name? don't i want to link it here? or link to their FB?
Let me ask.
That is bound to see a sizable increase in visitors here.
>mfw mods are all closetbronies
You might want to put that we could be moving domain soon.
not .co.cc?
To .net
Maybe.
<3 i just realized, these ponies drive me to emote

14Ah, well, I ripped it anyway. :P

dari are you not taking requests? or are you playing a playlist atm?
I heard the music, and I had to come back for this.
Oh, wasn't paying attention, didn't realise anyone had requested.
hmm
Sure you want that Daz some of them are bad.
14I was just watching the Garrys Mod entries, thats why I had the stream muted. :P
^_^

MFW I just typoed please instead of sleep
Maybe I should go and get some sleep. XD

What's adotube?
Hmm
6Only on this page.
6That I CAN'T CLOSE.

The epic one?

How were you planning to carry it up?

I can't brain today, I has the dumb.

6There's an AD.
still there?
6On my PAGE.
oh.

YAYYYYYYY
6That has NO close option.
<3
6And WON'T go away.
trumpet pinkie best pinkie
damnit i thought you were playing the digimon movie
Eugh, digimon.
:P
dari
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages ago.
but...
DIGIMON RUMBLE ARENAAAAA
Digimon world or something.
i could never get the freaking egg
6I was hoping you could script something... =/ We could do it manually, but it would require resaving the code every time we change the light.
digimon rumble arena only good one
pokemon's good
pokémon *
Yeah, I've got some ideas.
6Which would be a BITCH.
None are without fault though, and they depend on how the frontend room selection bit works.
Doesn't matter Daz.
You'll see.
6That way we don't have to worry if we feel like raising/lowering the light limits.
I was thinking.
6Steven?
Deposits people in the room with the least people.
:P
6I don't like that idea and you know it.
6I know.
6I just don't like the idea of auto-deposit.
Why?
superconfused
request http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo
6Auto-deposit kills that.
and uh. pointing at me? :O
We also have a room which is user unlimited but messages are throttled.
Igetitnow
whut is it Polarfire ?
Best of both worlds.
6User unlimited but messages throttled? Ew.
They're talking about how to distribute the viewers among the different rooms once S2 starts up
Unless friends get together.
6They'd select which room to join from a mane theater page.
And decide they are all going to go in one room.
6And it would deposit them there.
but then pepole may get split up :(
6If the friends aren't there, they can go to a different page.
^
Other rooms get left empty.
on the dash room.
instafull.
6First come first serve, dude.
inb4 silvershipper becomes livestream channel for the regulars :(
Yeah, but mods in the Dash room are gunna get raped.
6...there's a limit, they wouldn't.
:P
6And if one room is that over crowded and the others aren't, the mods can move to watch that room as needed.
6I really have thought this through, quite a bit.
With either a key, or invite only channel mode.
There's also a user limit mode.
But.
hmm
I'm not sure how well that'll work.
why not testrun it at some point midweek?
sure there'll be less people, but still
6>midweek
yea
"sure there'll be less people, but still"
6Yeah, nopony.
rally the troops.
>>>>"sure there'll be less people, but still"
scramble the legions.
Anyway.l
The system isn't sorted yet.

again, requesting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkF5DMAerAo :P
:P
How would the frontend work for you?
You can select each room.
To join the one you want.
6The lights system would be fairly easy to set up, as would room selection.
6There would be a mane theater page with room listings.
And how do we make sure the rooms are kept at even numbers of users?
6...that's why we could raise/lower the limits.
And the traffic lights work how?
6And if we raise/lower the limit, the lights would still work.
i agree...
>_< you're just messing with us discussing it here aren't you
14Ah, I see now.
That seems like a lot of work especially as we'd the limits on the channels themselves would be changing all the time.
6Automatically would mean having to change the coding every time we changed the limits.
oh.
6At all.
....
6And we'd be watching to see when we're getting close to the rooms being mostly full, and if most of the rooms are getting high, we'd raise the limits.
6We really wouldn't need to raise/lower limits unless we gained/lost a lot of viewers at once.
Otherwise this is gunna be a trainwreck.
I guarrantie it.
6That's fine, I suppose.
although you guys discussing it here with us is sorta just messing with us >_<
gurantee*
Just for curiosity sake. How many people are you guys expecting for this first stream?
6And if the channel is closed, it's grey.
14Especially after S2
Does the room get disabled?
6Yes, though we could do it just before the limit.
oh wow those x's
6The room isn't disabled.
6It just can't be joined.
The button
6Since it's at limit.
To take you to the room.
6It could be, yeah.
14Well, I meant after it airs Daz. :P
6We'll do a callout before kick, though.
idlti
Do the traffic lights update live?
i dont like that idea D;
but you could also just block all rooms other than standard ones (like maybe bronystate) until preshow?
then at preshow open up the rooms?
Or do you have to refresh the page to see?
ahah, umm, ignore me :D
6Yes, dari.
(solves afk problem without mass kicking)
6Live would be nice.
6If possible.
Actually, the cleverer people are just gunna see the traffic lights are pointless, and camp the room they want to get into by spamming /join room into their client.
6That's why the limit, dari.
i just thought opening them during preshow, rather than always, would solve a lot of kick hassle
6If it's full, then they can't join.
What's to stop people joining multiple rooms?
or hostmanes
6Or, more preferably, IP.
14I'll be sad I wont be able to talk to every single person watching the stream. lol
14Ah, okay.
6And won't count towards the limit.
14I thought I would be assigned to a specific room.
>won't count towards the limit
Not possible using the channel limit.
mode
for 10 mods
not hard :P
/me plays his own videos for the time being : /
6Yeah, just however mods are at the stream, add to the limit.
yea
But then those get filled up when not in use.
oh.
dem sevens
in preshow just get mods to join all channels or something
6Just make it count OPs in the mod channel.
6Or just count the mod channel.
Problem with not auto-delegating rooms.
A lot of problem might just keep trying the room they want until they get in.
i've been meaning to ask: why does my browser always say it's 'show time!' ?
Meaning that even though the other rooms aren't full no one's using them.
Because a lot of people are just trying to get into one room.
I just think that manual throws up a lot more problems than auto.
That was kind of the point of the room with everyone in.
6And we'd lower the limit and ask people to join another room to get people in the other room.
Lower the limit when the room is already full?
darp
They don't have to though.
The limit in this room is 3.
Are we just gunna kick random people out?
loool
That seems a bit unfair.
you might have to forve them if that is the case.
Well you could be splitting up friends then.
hopefully the ylisten
Which was the whole point of manual in the first place.
Well you could say the same thing for auto?
thats a lot of work.
They can still msg each other.
if you know how to use it =p
to pm all those people
6Auto would be annoying though.
Mods are going to be seriously tied up.
6And we'd still have people trying to join the room they want.
Polarfire: i think that's why they're still looking for more?
sadly might have to ask forcfully.
6Generic names are disgusting.
rainbow dash would be full all the time
6...because that would be bad, Daz.
[08:49] <hunty> rainbow dash would be full all the time
^
And the other rooms would be catching up slower.
.....
...
6The split is actually fairly even.
...
LOL
cant decide
6Rainbow would win.
6I'm not saying Rainbow wouldn't have more.
Which ever one has the people that I want to talk with in it.
6I'm saying Rainbow wouldn't have a COLLOSSAL FUCKTON more.
I dunno man.
All the people shift to the more popular one.
Rainbow's pretty popular.
Rainbow might not have vastly more to start with, but it'd quickly get known as the most popular and best room.
Because it always has the most people.
^
6Doesn't make it best.
there*
My poor brain.
XD
6It would be tested by then.
in a crowded room its hard to talk
To be honest.
?
6This has been discussed.
sorry
was reading TCB
6And again, troubleshooting.
And they'll all like a different pony.
6>room you're in
6You mean all of them?
6Or the room you'd be the mane mod in?
Yeah.
14All the above. lol
6>answers as if yes or no
:P
>British
xD xD
It's whatever you want it to be. ;2,15)
:P
6Mod room won't see all rooms. IRC doesn't work that way.
6Mod room is for us to discuss.
14If it did though...
14My mantra would be "quicker than the speed of light!"
lol
6OH GAWD DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
just get more mods and you'l be fine modding all the rooms at once
6We already have 13 mods.
6For 6 initial rooms.
14Yeah, we're getting up there.
6Realisitically we'd still need more, but not many.
6Sounds good to me, dari.
but, you know, you can just ignore me, thats for the best, "squeek"
6Since 30's not a ton more.
6>19
6TF are you talking about?
Hmm
But meh.
That's for automatic.
6Would be fine by me.
Well, does it?
um.
Is it supposed to?
beyond the literal?
Hmm
That's all?

Because Dragonite threw a fit last night.

The IRC server.
Hi guys
Why do I owe you a nighty night?
As I told Daz, I'm doing a run through of OoT with a special cheat active
Hey Daz, I'm doing pretty good. How u?
Two cheats *
whatever, Daz
heh
And then Polarfire decided to +m gave everyone voice and then logged off before unmuting the channel...
two special cheats
Oh right!
You'll have to wait till tonight. :p
hmm?
I can't exactly wish you good night when it's not night time. :p
Aw... Son, I am disappoint :P

Did they really leak the script though?
I dunno, at least the plot leaked

The story has been leaked somehow, I'm not going to read about it, though.
Also, is House gonna be streamed today?
EdwardNewgate: Sathi said it'd start at 3:30 Eastern
Aye
And the conclusion to TotalBiscuit's latest "Hyper WTF is" just came out, nice.
Torchlight 2 is looking pretty good.

It's an autojoin.

One of mIRCs features.
Auto rejoin on kick.
0I see, can he stop it?

There is one way he can stop. He has to close the window

Why do they call them sea ponies? They're technical name is hippocampi
0Their name is seahorses.

10thanks for that man<3
0Wait, Silvermane were you going to do something while I waited for a second?
oh right.
0WAT?
actually it was more due to the fact RD kept falling asleep on clouds
0Well, that does make sense...

you kidding? Arrival was terrible
0playing on PS3, neighas :P
Oh well.
it's such a lame excuse to put Shepard on trial for ME3
Arrival was such a stupid idea.
I liked Arrival
0just that you have everything on the disc
0I mean they say that it uses the ME3 engine, but I have seen a friend play ME2 on 360... couldn't see any difference.
7I cried this episode...

Not 4 years.
0Definitely wouldn't be able to run something like ME2 with the same details as on PS3 :(

oh man this ep ;__________________________;
0ergh, many manly tears were shed first time through this, yeah. :(
7meh I got them tears burning in my eyes now :(

If companies continue the trend of all games being console ports
$200
0much more price efficient
>$599
Errr
599 PS3 begs to differ
:p
I didn't either myself, but still paid $300 for it
5my current is still running strong at 5 years

10it's not comparable
Ouch
Through no fault of his own but still
yeah, I'm betting overclocking
if you aren't careful with overclocking, those cards can die in a snap
The difference is generally the price of a mid-high end graphics card.
7 4 more eps people
7enjoy
my argument for a PS3 was basically "I like the games, plus I don't have a Blu-Ray player"
0thanks Sathi
I must go for a while, there is to be no shipping while I am gone. NONE
5@pony to be shipped with Edwardnewgate

10yay another sports one :D
No
I paid $420 on a GTS 8800 640MB
Stupidest decision I ever made
I picked up a PS3 for the exclusives.
the idea of a "console war" is rediculous to me
0Me too... I wish they competed on more technical merits
Well Val, that's a war like for every type of product
0best services, best performance
oh I know
OH SHIT SHE'LL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND FALL IN THE POOL
Honestly, there aren't enough exclusives to overpower one console
0Don't think I've seen this ep
SHE COULD DIE
0my money says she hits her head
my problem with exclusives is I don't get to play games I'd want to
0because I've seen that happen, it's terrifying
0...oh, wrong guess :P
just because I'm not willing to buy two other consoles for like, 1 or two games
LOL
wow
5LOl
ROFL
That one I didn't see coming

Oh, yeah
Oh well...
You going to stream season 2 live when it starts airing?

/me 7knows what's causing it

7oh yes it was
7different music player :P

7good feedback

POP
That's VAC probably.
7yep
Bits per sample at 32 and priority and realtime
Is pretty much all you can do.
It's fine in terms of a leeeeeetle crackly
