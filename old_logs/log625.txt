<Dark92Something> I REFERENCED this song in the Ghost Stories episode!!!!!!!!!!!

<VenHur> ...Did you hear that noise? ...That was my jaw dropping to the floor...
<Meanwhile> FFFFFF.
<HoodyNinja> This lie was never proven wrong
<VenHur> ...Because of Luna...
<Spademagnes[R]> You're digging a hole rarity
<HoodyNinja> Rainbow Dash is still famous
<Eulshy> And her lyes never bite her in the flank
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: IKR?
*Meanwhile bangs LunaTheBeloved's knee on the floor.

<HoodyNinja> Spademagnes[R]: Rarity
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it rarity...
<TheKatPony> WOUNDAHFUULL
<RaveBrony> We need a Rarity and Luna episode! Have ALL the Tabitha! :D
<Eulshy> you can't spell Charity without rarity

<Saturn> 08,01SOOONG!
<CrimsonPhoenix> SOOOOOOONG
<RaveBrony> YES
<TheKatPony> Well no duh
<lowfn> One of the MANY reasons Rarity is my least favorite character
<RaveBrony> <3
<HoodyNinja> RaveBrony: Rarity/Octavia duet

<LunaTheBeloved> Cello Scoots
<RoboGerbil> monorail
<lowfn> Although she has good songs.
<TheKatPony> ooo rarity song
<VenHur> Aaaand song.

<thelonepony> Song time Kiddies!
<Spademagnes[R]> Rarity really lets her "fame" get to her head
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja: O_O This Needs to happen! :D
<Athgaar> Highlighting everything that's wrong with Rarity in 22 minutes
<AJIsAwesome> lowfn: But at least she learns from her mistakes, though.
<RAWRity> Oh god forbid a character have faults.
<Squallken> I missed it

<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Hello!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mare do well is why I hate Rainbow Dash
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja: No wai o.o
<TheKatPony> that the asswoopings be handed out.
<HoodyNinja> I love everypony
<HoodyNinja> stfu
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: meanwhile, RD's biggest lesson that's stuck is that she has the ability to read.
<LunaTheBeloved> Also: OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> never seen a Reikim ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Came back during the song.
<Spademagnes[R]> What the hell are those goggles on a stick supposed to be for?
<VenHur> I see Derpy!
*LunaTheBeloved breaks several of Meanwhile's toes
<RaveBrony> Dat Blueblood
<Dark92Something> DERPY
<Reikim> I mean in the title
<Franek12354> o_O
<AJIsAwesome> lowfn: Technically, there's no definite meaning of "good mistakes".
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> "a" is a hit on EQD has his own fic and stuff
<lowfn> She comes home drunk.
<Reikim> "Random Merch: a"
<TheKatPony> Derpy?
<RaveBrony> o_o
<RAWRity> Spademagnes[R]: opera binoculars
<Meanwhile> MOTHER OF OW.
<LadyCanary> ...So I guess she cleared things up with Blueblood?
<TheKatPony> damn, i missed her
<HoodyNinja> Omg Opal cared for 2 seconds
<RaveBrony> I guess, lol.
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh hey Opal knows what she hsould be doing\
<Dark92Something> O hai Blueblood, bai blueblood
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate Applejack because of Applebuck season
<HoodyNinja> mind=blown
<Reikim> a.
*Meanwhile snaps LunaTheBeloved's leg over his knee.
<Reikim> Bullshit.
<AJIsAwesome> LadyCanary: Or she blackmailed him....:D
<Spademagnes[R]> I guess opal isnt THAT big of a bitch
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: ...what
<LunaTheBeloved> ..............
<VenHur> Yeah, I see Derpy, I think um...third collum...third row?
<lowfn> AJIsAwesome: I make good mistakes alot in real life.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate Twilight because of About time
<Squallken> rawr i missed half of this awesome episode :(
<LunaTheBeloved> Children.....cover your ears....
<VenHur> I don't know...
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it rarity
<Dark92Something> CrimsonPhoenix: You seem to hate almost everypony
<CCCP> just use fucking youtube
<Spademagnes[R]> Stop ignoring your friends
<HoodyNinja> I hate CrimsonPhoenix because he hates ponies
<AJIsAwesome> I don't hate any of the ponies, IMO. At least they learn from their mistakes.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate Pinkie Pie because of friend in deed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim is an error that they make quite often and it evolved in the "a" meme on EQD at least
<spitfirecolt2> jet set sounds like a cool pony name
<RaveBrony> Pshhh, friends will understand :D
<lowfn> HoodyNinja: Wheres the love and tolerance?
<Eulshy> Friends birthday
<CrimsonPhoenix> just to say character centric episode SHOWS their fault
<RAWRity> I'm ore trying to figure out what the fuck would make somebody hate Twilight in It's About Time
<CCCP> I hate everything :s
*LunaTheBeloved lets out a blood chilling shriek of pure pain and agony as she falls onto the floor
<CrimsonPhoenix> nopony is perfect
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that happens quite often in the fic updates
<TheKatPony> damn it, Rarity, does the title of this show of no meaning anymore...
<Reikim> LunaTheBeloved: We haven't had children on here in...ever.
<Spademagnes[R]> Really rarity...
<Spademagnes[R]> REALLY
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, the fact that they give in negative issues makes them emotionally stronger.
<Athgaar> AJIsAwesome: Rarity doesn't; she just turns around and does it the very next time she gets the spotlight
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ScootaChicken is still jailbait
<HoodyNinja> lowfn: I'm made of cheese!
<TheKatPony> RRRGH
<AJIsAwesome> *give in to*
*Dark92Something CrimsonPhoenix hates (insert pony name) because of (insert episode name)
<TheKatPony> ^^
<ScootaChicken> Reikim hi
<RAWRity> Athgaar: again, what?
<Spademagnes[R]> Opal gives zero fucks
<Reikim> Oh yeah
*lowfn walks slowly to HoodyNinja and nibbles on him
<Spectrum_Rush> le gasp
<Reikim> We do have children.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Have you guys listen to a word I said?
<TheKatPony> Opal doesn't give a shit.
<Eulshy> My crotch is tastey
<AJIsAwesome> That's disgusting, Opal.:S
<Dark92Something> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
<CrimsonPhoenix> in trruth I love everypony but I love Rarity more
<Dark92Something> BREAK MY 4TH WALL, PINKIE
<Spademagnes[R]> SMOOTH MOVE RARITY
<CrimsonPhoenix> but nopony as a least rank
<Cypresswolf> thats the common cat reaction to everything
<HoodyNinja> Balloons are the greatest travel accessories
<Reikim> ...
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, you can't hate any of the ponies, just the mistakes they make.
<Spademagnes[R]> How do you store balloons in a case?
<Eulshy> That balloons attack failed
<Dark92Something> PREPARE for incoming meme
*LunaTheBeloved stands up slowly as she pulls out a bonesaw
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: She's Pinkie PIe.
<Spademagnes[R]> SEEMS LEGIT
<Reikim> Not in front of the children, guys!
<lowfn> Poor Opal.
<spitfirecolt2> i love this episode
<otakon|TF2> no no no'
*LunaTheBeloved slowly begins chaining through Meanwhile's leg
<shibaru> ORANGE BUTTERFLY SCIMITARS
<JESmith> Spademagnes[R]: It's Pinkie. She found a way
<TheKatPony> uh oh
<otakon|TF2> not poor Opal
<otakon|TF2> she's a bitch
<TheKatPony> xD
<otakon|TF2> also, gonna have to wait for TF2
<Athgaar> she's a non-sapient cat
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's so simple
<HoodyNinja> otakon|TF2: Ill play with you buddy
<Dark92Something> Spademagnes[R]: She's Pinkie Pie.......questions invalid
<otakon|TF2> also, I LOVE how Pinkie hops EVERYWHERE
<CrimsonPhoenix> so pratical
<CrimsonPhoenix> so ME
<Eulshy> opal has mascara
<Spademagnes[R]> Right lets go with that!
<Dark92Something> D'AAAAAAAAAW TWI <3
<otakon|TF2> okay back off to TF2
<lowfn> Oh Twi, you are the best.
<twilight_sprinkles> that dress looks ugly to me tbh..
<RAWRity> To be fair, Opal and Rarity seem to have a vitriolic best buds kind of thing going on.
<RaveBrony> Have fun, otakon|TF2
<Reikim> Unrelated: I can't write, therefore I shall game. I have a choice right now between Half Life 2 and Mass Effect. What do?
<TheKatPony> that dress if awful.
<Spademagnes[R]> Seems legit
<TheKatPony> *is
*Meanwhile 's moustache stretches out then springs back as he unleashes a shriek akin to blended gravel.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkles: nobody ever said Twilight had the best tastes.
<Cades> venezuelan poodle moths
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wich mass effect ?
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, Lauren Faust wanted to make them give in to negative things sometimes so that they learn from it and it makes them AND their character more in-depth.
<HoodyNinja> TheKatPony: Who's?
<Reikim> First one.
<Dark92Something> Spademagnes[R]: in Heavy Metal, there's a car in space.......QUESTIONS INVALID
<Forgottencrow> YAATATATATATTA
<Dark92Something> PARTY CANNON!!!!!!!!!
<Cades> those things are on your team :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> both are good
<Dark92Something> WOOOOO
<Spademagnes[R]> Can you blame twilight for having bad taste when she reads all day?
<TheKatPony> HoodyNinja: Twilight's >.>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> inb4 Twi's adorkable dance
<CrimsonPhoenix> Listen to AJIsAwesome guys
<LunaTheBeloved> I'd go Half Life, but thats just me
<HoodyNinja> TheKatPony: I like it ._.
<Reikim> Either way, I'm starting a new game.
<Cades> do you know about the team game?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rarity had a lot of good points
<lowfn> Spademagnes[R]: Bad taste? That dress is amazing! >_> <_<
<twilight_sprinkles> dat twi
<Reikim> Gonna take Luna's advice.
<AJIsAwesome> THe fact that they give into negative problems make them grow from them and helps them in the future.
<CrimsonPhoenix> has**
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also i keep forgetthing that "h" in which
<Eulshy> Conga line
<Reikim> Assuming here that a goddess of the night knows her stuff.
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: but nobdoy wants FAULTS with their characters! They just want every episode to have a Sonic Rainboom and to start Luna/Trixie/InsertBackgroundPonyHere
<CrimsonPhoenix> OCTAVIA
<Spademagnes[R]> I know characters show their faults but sometimes it makes them look like jerks sometimes
<thelonepony> OCTAVIA!
<AdamTheDuck> <3 Octavia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shiny.
<LunaTheBeloved> Heh heh heh.....

*Meanwhile sticks his finger into LunaTheBeloved's wound.
<AJIsAwesome> You can't learn from a mistake unless you experience it.
<owloysius> lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously I'm sick of seeing some shit post toward Rarity when all pony have their fault and NOPONY complain about those.
<Spademagnes[R]> Derp table?
<spitfirecolt2> i want a sapphire shores song
<TheKatPony> i watched a whole bunch of people getting their pants ripped off at Walmart.... lol

<Eulshy> then after, all mare put cake frosting behind their ears
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: I mean, c'mon. That whol exploring characters' shortcomings and having them grow from it thing is soooooo Season 2. Season 3 should be nothing but Luna and Vinyl Scratch calling Scootaloo a chicken for 13 episodes.
<Cades> thats on your team too :P
<Saturn> 08,01my god
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, you can't live a full life without making at least ONE mistake.

<owloysius> should have taken a quail feather
<Unnr> Spademagnes[R]: even cooler are victorian glass quills
<Reikim> Bricks and tumbleweeds, bricks and tumbleweeds...
<Kencolt> Where does Piniie get-- never mind.
<Dark92Something> CrimsonPhoenix: give me the link, please
<twilight_sprinkles> queshes are good
<Reikim> We need some sort of tumbleweed emoticon. Or something.
<Rex_Mundi> RaveBrony: Actually, OMG = Oh my goodness
<owloysius> spike: that's scootaloo, silly
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT appears behind of Meanwhile and ducks making the brick hit Meanwhile
<LunaTheBeloved> But only for in here
<thelonepony> silly Pinkie pie
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkles: You are a rat creature?
<Unnr> >_>
<Dark92Something> Kencolt: She's Pinkie Pie.......questions invalid
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Something, I don't really have it just remember seeing it
<Dark92Something> ZELDA SCOOTALOO
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> see that's why you don't use targeting bricks
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know Rarity is involve
<owloysius> why did spike just attack scootaloo?
<Spademagnes[R]> So how does a metal quil break?
<twilight_sprinkles> Unnr: haw?
<RaveBrony> Rex_Mundi: Yeah :D
<Dark92Something> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh OK
<Dark92Something> IT'S OVER 9000 <--------------
<lowfn> Spike is developing his power.
*LunaTheBeloved sits down and watches as the brick flies around
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkles: if you ever have the time, track down a comic named Bone
<thelonepony> spike is still jelly
<Spademagnes[R]> I assume I'm the only one who finds the fact Twilight never talks to spike about him possibly being jealous stupid?
*Meanwhile 's moustache shatters the brick on impact.
<Meanwhile> Mhmm.
<Dark92Something> WE NEED A PLOT
<AJIsAwesome> Unnr: I love Bone. Too bad it doesn't get a lot of attention.
<twilight_sprinkles> Unnr: well i probably wont have the time, but ill keep in my mind
<LunaTheBeloved> Mister Mustache
<Spademagnes[R]> HOW DIDIT GET BURNT
<Dark92Something> MOOD WHISLAP
<twilight_sprinkles> owlicious did it!
<DaringDerpy> gremlins
<Spademagnes[R]> HOW DID IT GET BURNT
<RaveBrony> :D
<owloysius> who?
<lowfn> who
<Rex_Mundi> Spademagnes[R]: Its because twilight, as smart as she is, has her air-headish moments.
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: The great cow race... enough said.
<Spademagnes[R]> It was your own fault SPIKE
<Dark92Something> NOT WHO! TWO!
<Spademagnes[R]> The bird had NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
<RaveBrony> Spike, you are a dragon... Fry him :D
<Cades> YAY LIGHTNING
<AJIsAwesome> Everyone gives in to their faults, it's just a natural thing in this world.
<Kencolt> Crowning moment of SILLY coming in.
<VenHur> Two? Doctor TWO?!
<DrSteveSCARz> love this part :D
<Ponies47> Oh. Well I can stay for a little bit longer. I just had to switch computers :P
<VenHur> ...Hmm...
<Spademagnes[R]> Where did he get the mustache?
<lowfn> Spademagnes[R]: His pcoket.
<RAWRity> So, I bet prince-dari is happy. Matt Smith's agreed to do at least another 2 series of Dr. Who
<shibaru> Where?
<DaringDerpy> spike is an idiot
<Spademagnes[R]> Yes because that looks like a real mouse
<Dark92Something> <-------- One second to hiss the ''villain'', please.
<XylemTube> I'd like to see an ep where Twilight accidentally makes everybody except her into G3.5 Ponies
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: He stole it from someone's mane.
*Unnr is debating sculpting a hat, cape and moustache for their spike
<Kencolt> Wait... where did he get the hat? And Cape? AND CATSUP? (He probably carrries the moustache around, so...)
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: True, these are flaued characters, as eveyone really is. If everything was happy and perfect than this would be G3 ponies.
<RaveBrony> Dat music :D

<Shizuka> 13yeah this windowed mode is an epic hack...
<Spademagnes[R]> People say they are MLG when they really arent
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: So it doesn't mean anything?
<PillowPoni> Hai WindWhistler~
<Reikim> Stuck again. There's water involved. I hit the knobby thing to raise the water level, now what?
<Shizuka> 13will take it as far as i can stand
<Meanwhile> All in all just say "MLG" if you want to look like a huge douche.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim one of the fun things is figuring out those puzzles
<derpy56> hi
<VenHur> Okay, I looked up Google, and it's funny that the thing I said earlier that it really was a Red Ant...and I encounter a rat-sized one...

<Spademagnes[R]> You're better than me in a game.. woop de fucking doo
<WindWhistler> Is that what MLG stands for?
<flutter_spin> "Tron 2.0"
<Spademagnes[R]> It means nothing
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Thank you.
<flutter_spin> You learn a lot about computers in this game
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then half life should be easier

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03<_<
<LunaTheBeloved> I play games to have fun, and by having fun I mean "Beating my oppenents into the ground several times then dancing on there graves as I utterly destroy everything."
<WindWhistler> Saturn: Wasn't it 4am two hours ago?
<Reikim> It was only a hidden entrance thingie.
<Saturn> 08,01why is this my ideal place of work?

<Saturn> 08,01WindWhistler: not in the UK
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Please, go to sleep. You need to rest.:)
<NocturnalBlade> evening everypony
<Spademagnes[R]> Mlgs are the stop having fun guys
<NullRadix> Saturn: because otherwise you'd have to deal with people?
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Hello!
<Shizuka> 13hate that subs are hiding
<flutter_spin> good o' disc
<WindWhistler> Oh I could've sworn you said it was 4am where you were a couple of hours ago...
<flutter_spin> I see subs :P
<Spademagnes[R]> Frisbees?
<Shizuka> 13yeah but they're cut off
<NocturnalBlade> what tron game is this?
<flutter_spin> WindWhistler: yeah, I thought so too
<Meanwhile> Huzzah for 11 past 4 Saturn.
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Tron 2.0
<Saturn> 08,01NullRadix: but i *love* dealing with people!
<Shizuka> 13subs are still operating on the assumption this is 1440x900
<VenHur> So what happens so far?
<Shizuka> 13it's not
<flutter_spin> --- Shizuka is playing Tron 2.0 from 2003 ---
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: ah
<PillowPoni> Anyone know how much laptop batteries cost?
<flutter_spin> uhhh $40?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is bad that i want to get lux just for the "i'm charging my lazer taunt/joke ?
<NullRadix> Saturn: even the "oh hey we need you to stay 4 hours later than usual today" type of people?
<Shizuka> 13any ponies have I Hate Mountains for L4D1?
<WindWhistler> Think of it this way Shizuka: We're sharpening our ears.
<Reikim> Nope
<WindWhistler> I mean hearing
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<Reikim> She's actually a pretty good support.
<Reikim> And it's fun picking people off with the lazer.
<Spademagnes[R]> 10101010110
<WindWhistler> So are the orange guys computer programs?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> support ? AP Nuke plz
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: depends on the laptop it for i guess
<Spademagnes[R]> Triforce?
<Spademagnes[R]> holy shit
<Meanwhile> I hate that laser.
<Reikim> Well, she can do that too.
<Reikim> But Lux is really a better support on top or bot.
<flutter_spin> the disc made this game.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also want ezreal just for the hare hare yukai dance
<AJIsAwesome> Is that the Triforce?:O
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade its an Acer aspire 5517
<Spademagnes[R]> Suddenly Rinzler
<Unnr> NullRadix: You still need to file your TPS reports
<Reikim> Lux is best as a support because of her shield.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and because i been playing a lot of champs with skill shoots
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: ok, hold on and i'll look it up for ya
<DerpyMuffins> This doesnt require alot of gemotry does it?
<PillowPoni> NocturnalBlade: thanks.
<Spademagnes[R]> Where did ti go?
<owloysius> 0x43727573682c206b696c6c2c2064657374726f792c2073776167
<flutter_spin> I don't know. The little additions you have to put on yourself throughout the game made the game even more fun
<Spademagnes[R]> I still cant get over the fact the triforce is on the disc
<Saturn> 08,01NullRadix: let's jsut say that i'm surprised at myself for enjoying managing a convention more than managing a cloud computing cluster
<flutter_spin> aw yeah.
<Saturn> 08,01i love telling people what to do, and fixing problems, and making people happy
<NocturnalBlade> PillowPoni: no prob ^_^
<Unnr> Saturn: That's cause you can't write dirty filk about the cluster
<Saturn> 08,01ha!

<DerpyMuffins> Why is everything blue again?
<cachi01|phone> But if you are talking about the DOS version
<Dken2021> there are other weapons?

<Spademagnes[R]> It looked pretty good for its time
<cachi01|phone> Tron 2.0 was like a fps if i remember
<Dken2021> as this is a tron game, everything os color coded for your conveince
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh good can we have some KFC then?
<Dken2021> *is

<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: You have to get all the red rings, sorry.
<flutter_spin> its like... F8 or something. I can't remember

<Barbetos> Then you won't understand him
<flutter_spin> Depends on how you think they will receive it. My cousin is cool with anything I do, so I told him. My brother already hates me with Phineas & Ferb. I don't dare tell him.

<flutter_spin> its 2003. Yes its 1st person. It even has the lightcycle games.
<Spademagnes[R]> This game sure fucking loves red
<flutter_spin> wait until the corruptions. All you see is green
<VenHur> Champion_of_Harmony: You think the first person sections are fun? Boy, you haven't seen the Lightcycle racing...
<Champion_of_Harmony> I have seen it.
<VenHur> Oh...
<Champion_of_Harmony> and they also look fun
<VenHur> Hm...wonder what'll happens if the world of TRON gets Error 404...
<cachi01|phone> Lightcycle is best part in EVERY tron related stuff

<OtakuTom> I was about to ask if that was a Tron game...lol
<Champion_of_Harmony> Awww
<DerpDash> end?
<VenHur> Shizuka: So, you're telling us that if the game becomes a little more like Mass Effect-like user interaction, it can be...better?
<Champion_of_Harmony> where can you get it?
*PillowPoni rolls around the chat
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai Engineer

*Canadian_Brony was hugged
<AJIsAwesome> Good night!
*NocturnalBlade is hugged
*Dken2021 hugs back :D
*Ponies47 Hugs AJIsAwesome back
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: Big arms :P
<VenHur> Actually, I rather prefer "LavaRuby than "MagmaRuby" since the team in Pokemon Ruby is called "Team Magma"...
*SuperBrony64 hugs everypony ^-^
<Champion_of_Harmony> and they never make a third for remakes discord.
<VenHur> Just thoughted of it,
*Canadian_Brony was hugged again

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,032nd Gen was best gen~

<Spademagnes[R]> Eh
<owloysius> 1st gen was best gen
<LadyCanary> I liked gen 3 ._.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Scoot-Scootaloo agreed
<Champion_of_Harmony> but I love all gens
<NocturnalBlade> i like all the gens!
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo everypony has their own opinions.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Im just a fan of pokemon.
<Petrified_Discord> Digimon is best Pokemon gen
<VenHur> ^ Say wuh?

<NocturnalBlade> Champion_of_Harmony: here here lol
<NocturnalBlade> Petrified_Discord: lol
<Canadian_Brony> I don't even know what that is Scoots
<Dken2021> never really saw the point in remaking gen 3, but since gamefreak likes money, looks like it's inevitable
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: Electric giraffe with flippers
<VenHur> Scoot-Scootaloo: I got a Shiny Ponya in Diamond Version.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Horry no one is arguing about the other gens!
<Spademagnes[R]> I still find it funny people who say Pokemon designs now are lazy ignore Electrode
<LadyCanary> :I Motherfucking Flygon.
<Dken2021> Canadian_Brony some kind of mutant sheep
<LadyCanary> My baby.
<Sumica> 00,10Oh god, they are making a how to train your dragon show.

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ponyta's are SOOO cool~
<DerpDash> i remember the time i found a shiny flaffy but my power died like 10 seconds after i caught it

<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ampharos.jpg
<Dken2021> Sumica what is this, like the 5th show coming from dreamworks?
<Spademagnes[R]> <.<
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica What. The. Buck. I didn't even like the movie much because it's nowhere close to the book.
<Champion_of_Harmony> I found a shiny Staru....and he had a very high defence.
<Ponies47> A How to Train Your Dragon TV show? Does every Nick movie have to have a spin of show!!?!!?! :[
<Canadian_Brony> Petrified_Discord looks like a pokemom
<Champion_of_Harmony> Yes they do.
<Canadian_Brony> *pokemon
<VenHur> Sumica: I see you check CN's website, and yes it's true...First Penguins, then Kung Fu Panda, now THIS?!

<Champion_of_Harmony> HEY!
<Champion_of_Harmony> I liked penguins....
<Dken2021> wonder if hiccup is is gonne be still handicapped
<VenHur> Ponies47: Actually, that show is on Cartoon Network...
<Spademagnes[R]> I still think Electrode is the laziest design ever
<VenHur> The others are on Nick.
<Canadian_Brony> either way, it's unnecessary
<DerpDash> Spademagnes[R]: what about ditto?
<Ponies47> VenHur: Cartoon Network? Let the shit fest of a TV show begin!
<Spademagnes[R]> Suddenly Wii
<LadyCanary> :D A super MOO stream

<otakon> Wii
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 is streaming. Am I correct?
<otakon> so ....old
<LadyCanary> Yes
<Canadian_Brony> yay
<VenHur> Electrode's the laziest design for a Pokemon? DUDE! IT'S AN UPSIDE-DOWN POKEBALL WITH EYES! ...Personally Voltorb's design is lazier...
<Champion_of_Harmony> Pokemon? Gamecube? some other game?
<Canadian_Brony> I like Gamecube
<Spademagnes[R]> Yet people say the pokemon now are lazy
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Canadian_Brony: Indeed you are.
<Champion_of_Harmony> well they wanted to keep things generic, voltorb was acually a failed pokeball experiment...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll brb for a min, need to grab something.
<Spademagnes[R]> Yea I know but its evo is still fucking lazy
<Petrified_Discord> VenHur: And then they made Foongus. Like..what the fuck?
<VenHur> Actually, Scolipede's an awesome Pokemon in design.
<Champion_of_Harmony> and ditto was a failed attempt at cloning mew.
<DerpDash> Spademagnes[R]: yea they took just about every animal in real life and attached an object to it
<Cades> yay!
<Mayonaiize> Whoop!
<VenHur> Petrified_Discord: *checks Google and facepalms* Oh. my. gooood...
<Reikim> Yaaaaay, the boat is no longer useless.
<Petrified_Discord> VenHur: It evooooolves
<Champion_of_Harmony> what?
<Cades> shibaru just left like half an hour ago
<Spademagnes[R]> At least foongus looks creative
<Petrified_Discord> Spademagnes[R]: It looks like a fungus. :/
<Spademagnes[R]> More origonal than a upside down pokeball...
<kirzstryfe> ?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ice Cream man was meh teir...
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 I should mention this now before I forget. You have your resolution set to widescreen, when clearly it should be full screen. Your circular icons aren't circles.
<Dken2021> ohai game that is just a SNES game on a disc
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Snowflake man was "You have to be shittin me" teir
<Canadian_Brony> Ooh! Play a Gamecube game!
*Ponies47 Gives Scoot-Scootaloo a tub of ice cream
<Champion_of_Harmony> yeah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02First time playing this game :)

<Champion_of_Harmony> Pokemon colosium!
<LadyCanary> Good luck, SB64!
<Champion_of_Harmony> or however you spell it
<Reikim> And I juse got the gun on the boat.
<Meanwhile> And the winner of Context-begone quote of the day is...
<Spademagnes[R]> I have yet to see a pokemon lazier looking than Electrode
<VenHur> I don't know why, but I hate All Stars 25th Aniversary edition, I first, I thought it was going to be all the classic Mario games, now rendered in 2.5D NSMB Wii style.
<Champion_of_Harmony> eh?
<LadyCanary> OH! I've heard of this game.
<otakon> yes
<otakon> I have too
<DerpDash> never heard of it
<Ihop> that was a bitchin game Champion_of_Harmony
<VenHur> But then I facepalmed, knowing it's the EXACT. SAME. GAMES.
<Mayonaiize> oh dang, just missed them
<otakon> it's supposed to be like a last hurrah for RPG's for the Wii
<Petrified_Discord> I remember when I found Vanillite for the first time. I knew I needed and ice type, but I just took one look at the sapient ice cream cone in front of me and said, "No." Then I buried it in the deepest, darkest depths of my PC.
<Dken2021> Last story huh? are you gonna quit like with Xenogears?
<Spademagnes[R]> So its a port of a port?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Person who produced this game was the creator of the Final Fantasy series :)
<NocturnalBlade> i have never heard nor seen this game before...this could be interesting ^_^
<otakon> supposed to be really good
<Champion_of_Harmony> Pokemon collsium? yes it was
<Reikim> Meanwhile?
<DerpDash> random mii's here to ruin your entire day
<Mayonaiize> So its been pretty active then?
<Meanwhile> No, you.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Last (Final) Story (Fantasy) :)
<Reikim> Oh well that makes sense then.
<Canadian_Brony> Champion_of_Harmony I dissaprove your misuse of the saying "eh?"
<DerpDash> ooooh
<Cades> yeah
<Petrified_Discord> SuperBrony64: "Dude, we promise, THIS is the FINAL one."

<Petrified_Discord> Our heroes, ladies and gentlemen. Hiding.
<Spademagnes[R]> Why does ANYONE need a sword that huge?
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: to stab things
<VenHur> Oh hi Sephiroth wannabee.
<otakon> that are a bit further away
<Ihop> to look badass
<Canadian_Brony> Spademagnes[R] if you can swing a big sword efficiently, swing away!
*Dovah Facedesk
<Petrified_Discord> So much flipping
<Dken2021> Spademagnes[R] you know what they say about guys with bigs swords right?
<otakon> seriously to answer that question is for range and power

<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, its been in there for a while, its why i was raging about java in the other channel :P
<Unnr> Phase4: Oooooh, that makes much, much more sense
<Austin> Phase4: are you a mod too?
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'm feeling better about it now...Chrome tells me I need to install the plugin...no chance I'm doing that right now...lol
<Phase4> 00,02Austin, not really, i'm a tech
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 okay, i have a purple screen. that means I have java installed?
<Unnr> Phase4: I thought it was a pet project...
<Canadian_Brony> Austin he can stream, tho
<Austin> Phase4: still importnat
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, you have java installed
<Phase4> 00,02Austin, true
*Unnr doesn't interact with the BS site much, bookmark to spike + external client
<Canadian_Brony> then why the buck isn't it listed as an add-oN/
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, because its a plugin
<Metronome> ^TL;DR So....... java is harming your computer? i'm going to uninstall java :(
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_Brony, yes there is a difference, rather important one
<Canadian_Brony> that's what I meant
<Canadian_Brony> it isn't listed there

<Austin> SuperBrony64: dont play my Wii anymore

<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, Never liked WoW's subscription so they never had my vote in the first place :P
<OtakuTom> It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but WoW won't be losing subs to it, since GW2 has n subs
<Canadian_Brony> first time I bucked that up.
<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: ohhh ok
<TheRandomkid321> Today a bunch of girls where talking about Skyrim. I went to talk to them after class and I asked them "Have any of you played Morrowind?" They asked "What's Morrowind."
<OtakuTom> Thanks for the stream SB
<TheRandomkid321> Stream over :(
<Dark_Horst> AdamTheDuck: it was fun for a while, but after continuous downgrading i started feeling robbed. havent played it since cataclysm came out. i think i'm gonna terminate my account now

<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst, Ah I remember the times when there weren't any expansion packs :3
<OtakuTom> Cataclysm did kinda suck...from everything I've done in the MoP beta, though, things are looking up.

<Dark_Horst> this reminds me of the doomguy comic
<TheRandomkid321> Is this a mod?
<Canadian_Brony> scottish-geeky first time I said I didn't get it, nitt said "Where was Gondor when Lunar_Brony didn't get it"
<MadSurge> CURB STOMPING TIME
<OtakuTom> Nah, this is the version for the Sega Neptune
<MASF123> Sumica, oh god there was an NES version.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SNES is best though :<
<TheRandomkid321> MASF Yep

<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: lol yah

<scottish-geeky> so far i like this
<Canadian_Brony> that ws rather frustrating or me
<MASF123> MadSurge Sumica said there was an NES version
<Canadian_Brony> *foe
<TheRandomkid321> This is a mod right... RIGHT!?
<Canadian_Brony> **FOr
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 Lemme check
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: yep
<Canadian_Brony> my keyboard's acting up
<Sumica> 00,10no thre was no nex or snes so dar as i know
<MASF123> SuperBrony64 Super FX chip?
<Alchemist> Ihop: you never heard about Manhunt then
<Sumica> 00,10just n64
<Ihop> nope
<MASF123> oh
<scottish-geeky> all this needs is death metal
<Dark_Horst> so much delicious blood
<MadSurge> Sumica: there was a SNES version of Doom
<scottish-geeky> Dark_Horst: (\
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MASF123: The chip that came with certain SNES games to help improve the graphics capabilities of the system specifically for that game. Like Yoshi's Island, Star Fox, etc.
<Dark_Horst> scottish-geeky: /)
<scottish-geeky> CHANE SAW FTFW
<Sumica> 00,10wow that must have been hard to port
<MASF123> SuperBrony64 I heard that chip was used to make 3D for Star Fox 2.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MASF123: It was going to be used for that game as well, but they never released the game.
<Canadian_Brony> STREAM!!
<MASF123> It got leaked but...not really retail.
<MadSurge> Sumica: they had to remove a lot. That's why Id made Noah's Ark possible
<Sumica> 00,10SuperFX was used in whole freanchise of games
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek is playing a Doom game
<MadSurge> Just to get back at Nintendo
<scottish-geeky> dead
<SuperBrony64> 11,02If you look on the bottom of certain SNES games, like the ones I mentioned, they have extra connectors to the SNES compared with regular SNES cartridges to allow the Super FX to work with the processor in the SNES unit.
<MadSurge> DED
<OtakuTom> lol...Super Noah's Ark.
<MASF123> I played it and I will say the framerate was bad but the game was fun.
<MASF123> OtakuTom, AVGN?
<scottish-geeky> OtakuTom: lol
<Sumica> 00,10was't superFX basixly like what the 32x tryed to be.
<OtakuTom> Yea
<MASF123> Oh SEGA and their gimmicks.
<MASF123> But now Nintendo's doing that as well.
<Sumica> 00,10nintendo has been doing it long before now
<scottish-geeky> all the murder it so pritty
<Canadian_Brony> I need to play Doom
<OtakuTom> Yea...the power glove is the perfect example of them trying to be gimicky
<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: yes you do mate
<MASF123> It's SOOOO Bad.
<MASF123> The Power Glove.
<MASF123> Well remember that Nintendo was once a Toy COmpany, so I can see why they were like that when they started out.
<Canadian_Brony> The Chainsaw. Rngdgdgddrngdrgnd!
<MASF123> But now...it's getting ou of hand with their accesories.
<OtakuTom> They originally made playing cards
<MASF123> For real?
<Canadian_Brony> wow
<scottish-geeky> what he needs is THE BIG FUCKING GUN 9000
<Canadian_Brony> If you can't see it, kick it.
<Canadian_Brony> scottish-geeky fuck yeah!
<OtakuTom> When they first started in 1889 (yes, the 19th century :P), they produced and marketed a card game called Hanafuda
<MASF123> Duke's Mighty Boot.
<scottish-geeky> Canadian_Brony: (\ horaa
<Canadian_Brony> scottish-geeky /)
<OtakuTom> I think my favorite piece of Nintendo History trivia is that they once tried to run a chain of Love Hotels in Japan...lol
<scottish-geeky> OtakuTom: lol
<Canadian_Brony> wow
<Canadian_Brony> that's . . . interesting
<MASF123> They also worked with Sony once.

<Canadian_Brony> Panda that is why we need new fonts to display what emotes can't.
<Canadian_Brony> or we just need to be more creative with out emotes
<Panda> Sumica, are italics just like colors on bronystate?
*Canadian_Brony Panda these are italics
*MASF123| use they are.

<Sumica> 00,10no those are not italics Canadian_Brony, just the web client desplays them as such
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica alright. I get it now

<Sumica> 00,10as well as color.
<MASF123|> ...but I can do that on another channel Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10depends
<MASF123|> In the Spike room people kept using colored text
<Canadian_Brony> Spike has no chat tho
<Sumica> 00,10Spike is not our room

<Sumica> 00,10spike some one else made after we had the spike theader. probably trying to impersonate one of our rooms
<MASF123|> ok sure
<MASF123|> Sumica...that makes things comfusing.
<Canadian_Brony> I don't think Wrek's a fan of the chainsaw.
<Sumica> 00,10only for those useing stand alone chats MASF123|
<Phase4> 00,02seems the chat embed is down
<Canadian_Brony> what does that mean?
<Sumica> 00,10it meens dont refresh your chat Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> k
<Panda> what if he derps?
<MASF123|> So...what you mean is other lightIRC chats can invite others to their chats? As in everyone is link to one server? :O
<MadSurge> Hi Saturn :)
<Canadian_Brony> Panda that's what I was about to ask
*Panda stares at Saturn
<Sumica> 00,10unfortunatly the chat embed is handled by ponychat

<Sumica> 00,10it's all one network
<MASF123|> Holy crap.
<Panda> oh killerpony7733 you still up?

<MASF123|> strange I guess that erm guy knows how to do that.
<MASF123|> or was it ehm?
<MASF123|> I forgot his nickname it has 3 letters
<Sumica> 00,10it's not exactly hard
<Panda> MASF123| I can help you with getting a client if you'd like
<Magical_Pablez94> ehm.
<MASF123|> Thanks Panda
<Sumica> 00,10it's just /join and then the channle name
<Canadian_Brony> sounds easy enough
<MASF123|> That I know...SuperBrony64 told me that.
<Panda> Sumica he would have to connect to the ponychat network first~
<MASF123|> WHat I mean is make a new channel and invite others to it.
<Sumica> 00,10well if he is in chat here he is connected
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123|, to make a new channel just join one that doesnt exist
<Sumica> 00,10same way MASF123|
<MASF123|> ok...so. Let me try this. I've done it before without knowing.
<Canadian_Brony> FATALITY
<Panda> MASF123| well /invite (name here) would be the command.
<Panda> i think
<Pinkies4thWall> Has anypony heard of equestricon, the new (next may) con that's coming to Salt Lake?
<Panda> Pinkies4thWall D: there is one there?
<Magical_Pablez94> MASF123| is exactly as Phase4 says but if you want for the channel to exist forever u have to register it.
<Panda> NET SPLIT!
<Jmo> HAHA
<Pinkies4thWall> Panda: yeah, I'm planning on going
<MASF123|> Like that?
*Phase4 00,02ducks while the net is split
<Magical_Pablez94> lol netsplit.
<Panda> That was not me!
<Panda> i swear!
<Jmo> I blame Panda.
<Phase4> 00,02^

<Yahooz> Panda: hes been triple kicked before

<Pinkies4thWall> So, SuperBrony64. Add me on Face?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02A net split is where one of the IRC servers goes haywire and thus forces you to connect to a separate server.
<Panda> Yahooz challenge considered?
<MASF123|> :kickcount Panda
<Magical_Pablez94> that's what you get for causing the netsplit, Panda ! ;)
<DeathStar> Panda: that is why you need to use full stops and space and commas instead of enter

<MASF123|> Awwww... :(
<Canadian_Brony> pl

<AdamTheDuck> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02They announced a bunch of Japan titles that would either never get released in the US or would take at least two years and finally talked about games we knew about already.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT
<CrimsonPhoenix> That's bull
<Tovler> I kinda hurts to look at Monster Hunter 4 and Bravely Default footage.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Probably the best news was a new Professor Layton game.
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64|Zzz, WOOOOOOOOOOOT
<AdamTheDuck> PROFESSOR LAYTON <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> You mean the fifth one I knew about already?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02But the worst news was that it's going to be the last Layton game.
<AdamTheDuck> Awwwwwwwwwwww.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Nope, sixth one.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> I
<CrimsonPhoenix> kinda knew about that one too
<CrimsonPhoenix> kinda neat to know it's on its way
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02How? They /just/ announced it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I saw how the creator had a sixth planned long ago
<Tovler> we'll have to wait 3 years for it to reach NA anyway.
<CrimsonPhoenix> when the fifth was announced for Japan
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Either way, it was officially announced today.
<CrimsonPhoenix> neato
<CrimsonPhoenix> but was MH4 in that list of japan games that won't be here?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02And it's going to be the last Professor Layton game/
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't mind that
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Don't know.
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Still waiting for Monster Hunter 3 to come out on the 3DS here.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Layton has enough game in my opinion and it has been a fun ride
<CrimsonPhoenix> WAIT SuperBrony64|Zzz DO YOU HAVE TRI ON WII?

<Jmo> Bleh headphones
<MadSurge> I like the girl too :D
<Vivix> Why you ask?
<Jmo> Not loud enough >__>
<Jmo> Just curious :3
<Vivix> true, hehe
<Saturn> 08,01louder!
<Vivix> I want M-Audios for mixing, and something like JBL for practice-
<Vivix> like active PA
<Jmo> Ah JBL, my father goes crazy over those.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DEM PPG SOUNDS
<Saturn> 08,01i have a pair of Etymotic Research ER-4S'

<AdamTheDuck> So what's debian?
<Vivix> aah, yeah. I'm not sure what I want for mixing, would be nice to have somethign I can use at night
<Phase4> exciting real time linux action
<Vivix> but yeah for practice I want something that's loud enough- so a floor pa would be neat
<Phase4> Saturn, installing debian alongside arch
<Phase4> gota do something while i'm waiting for respawn
<Phase4> installing native from inside a vm
<Phase4> because screw you microsoft
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: yay debian!

<AdamTheDuck> Fight the powah!
<Vivix> BronyInstrumental, yeah JBL is nice, our neighbourroom in school blew out theirs and had to pay the school for it-
<Saturn> 08,01and i generally prefer Debian Testing over Ubuntu

<MadSurge> Saturn: I'm too dumb for operating systems without a graphical interface :|
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: aye, because stable is stable, but stagnant
<MadSurge> :D VYNIL!
<Phase4> makes sense
<Vivix> when I used linux, I'd play the included games, mess around with installs and break down crying
<Vivix> It was lovely days, though
<Phase4> Saturn, is there something like ... whats it called
<Phase4> that thing ubuntu has

<MadSurge> RD@
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLP is not even 2 years old and episode in season 1 are considered classics
<CrimsonPhoenix> how odd
<Lil_B> oh, that sounds terrible Dark92Enigma :(
<MadSurge> THEFUCK
*Pearly highhooves tSparx :D
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: anything we can do to help?
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix I hope there won't be a war about what was the best season after S3
<Dark92Enigma> I'm better now.......i gotta find when is the funeral
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, OF COURSE there will
<Lil_B> btw whats on the tream right now?
<tSparx> I can't wait for the complaints that Season 3 was when the show started going downhill...
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: i'll be fine.......
<tSparx> Of course, I hope it isn't. It probably won't be. But people are gonna say it no matter how good it is.
<Vivix> Just like simpsons
<Vivix> Every season is "worst season ever" until next season
<Dark92Enigma> tSparx: Just like Spongebob
<Vivix> of course, simpsons fans are much angrier
<Lil_B> tSparx the show was way better when they just used to ... instead of ... end when they did ... they petrayed the FANS!
<Jmo> I CAN'T RESIST ANYMOAR.
<Vivix> !
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge but a hug will do just fine
<tSparx> Lil_B ^^dat^^
<Vivix> UDDED
<prince-dari> wa u sai jaymoo
*Jmo slaps prince-dari around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Don't talk to me hater ;~;
<MadSurge> Lil_B: what show yoou be talking about?
<prince-dari> GTFO Matt Smith lover
<Lil_B> Jmo u so random
<Lil_B> MadSurge MLP
<Jmo> YOU WANNA GO?
<tSparx> MadSurge: The inevitable convo about Ssn 3
<Jmo> DAVID TENNANT WAS BEST DOCTOR, BUT MATT SMITH IS STILL GREAT.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, that's pretty much arguments general
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: when they did betray the fans? When Maggie talked?
<prince-dari> U WOT M8
<Jmo> I'LL WHOOP YOUR ARSE AYE.
<tSparx> Exactly
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma not yet, it was a hypotetical angry comment for people after S3
<prince-dari> I'LL FUCKIN' 'AVE YE
<Vivix> People say that about new seasons, no matter what the show usually. Of course simpsons fans are teh angriest and will always say that
<tSparx> Lil_B was quoting the future.
*Jmo slaps prince-dari around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> YEAH.
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix yeah... it's always the same
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: what was it? PM me if it's neccesary
<MadSurge> Lil_B: careful with that, people might not tell the difference from a true complaint :D
<MadSurge> PINKIE DED
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah... next time I need to indicate the irony better :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: S3 will be great :$
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma here you go :P "the show was way better when they just used to ... instead of ... end when they did ... they petrayed the FANS!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, it was fine as it is
<CrimsonPhoenix> people just don't scroll up to check the contest
<CrimsonPhoenix> ever
<Vivix> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> context even
<Vivix> People will say that, and we will be sad and defensive, but people always say things like that
<Lil_B> MadSurge Probably... if tehy will finally anounce the start !!!
<Vivix> Just look at when they said "S4 is worst simpsons ever! Original writers left Rarararar!" and now it's considered one of the best
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: I've noticed many times how much text on this channel goes into repeating information that we talked about earlier.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: they be trolling :D
<tSparx> Of course, that's a universal problem on IRC, not just here on #BronyState
<Lil_B> MadSurge I see it coming... next Ssaturrday at 7pm middle european time ... someone is screaming in the chat "GUYS TURN ON THE HUB FOR GOD SAKES!!!!!"
<MadSurge> CELESTIA
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: In which episode they did that? They broke the fourth wall!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: exactly :D
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma none, I made that up myself :P
<tSparx> Who's streaming right now anyway?
<RaveBrony> Phase4 i think
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: Oh. About the Simpsons, right?
<Phase4> tSparx, i am
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fw7hNSHg1qzcdbeo1_1280.jpg Pizza of the century

<Phase4> o_O
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: Oh. And when they betray the fans? I don't feel betrayed
<tSparx> Dark92Enigma: He was quoting the future
<Phase4> POOTIS
<tSparx> Dark92Enigma: Sample-text, the inevitable reaction of some fans to Ssn 3
<MASF123> Que n Que?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Who likes scaling charts?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/EdcI9.png
<Dark92Enigma> OH! now i get it..........I HOPE IT'S NOT TRUE!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, it will
<tSparx> Dark92Enigma: True or not, people will say it
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still see some debates about Season 1 and 2 to this day in /mlp/
<Phase4> Saturn, debian really wants to handle its own grub.cfg doesnt it
<Dark92Enigma> Which reminds me of Spongebob........what is the worst SB episode in your opinion?
<CrimsonPhoenix> everything after the movie
<Lil_B> good thing I don't go to 4chan... or any site that ends with chan
<tSparx> Most distros hate you messing with grub.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, I'm glad you at least don't go in Ponychan
<tSparx> It's annoying.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that place is like those futuristic society where everyone cannot think and where there's a Big Brother watching your every move
<alexxm> i don't know i never really watched spongebob
<Dark92Enigma> Personally, i guess Atlantis Squarepantis is the worst of all time
<Dark92Enigma> TWILIGHT THEME!!!!
<MASF123> That is the worst episode IMO.
<Dark92Enigma> Now i feel pumped!!!!!
<Dark92Enigma> TWILIGHT SPARKLE*
<MASF123> All singing no plot...it was garbage.
<tSparx> Yay
<Lil_B> <3 Debn Daglish
<Lil_B> Ben*
<MASF123> Yay.
<MASF123> AFK people are gone.
<MASF123> 97 active
<MadSurge> I heard this song alive! :D
<MadSurge> *live
<tSparx> MadSurge: I heard this song as a zombie.
*MadSurge throws cabbages at tSparx
<Dark92Enigma> MASF123: What pisses me off the most, is all the buildup for it......toys, commercials, a videogame spinoff (WAY better than the ep IMO) and WHAT was the result? NOTHING
*tSparx loves cabbages
<Dark92Enigma> TWI!!! NOOO!
<tSparx> (not really)
<Dark92Enigma> MY CABBAGES!!!!!!!!
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: Fffft :D
<tSparx> hahaha
<tSparx> We should have an Avatar (TLAB) marathon sometime
<Dark92Enigma> Come on, you were expecting that joke
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, what are you exactly talking about?
<tSparx> It's an Avatar reference
<tSparx> Avatar TLAB
<tSparx> This poor dude, everywhere Team Avatar went, they accidentally ruined his cabbages.
<tSparx> One of the funniest running gags in the history of running gags.
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: i was talking about Atlantis Squarepantis......then i made an Avatar reference (the most infamous meme from the series)
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah Atlantis Squarepants
<CrimsonPhoenix> mind to enlight me some more about that one episode?
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: good to hear that, for i will review that single ep when i start my own show on YouTube
<Dark92Enigma> here it goes
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPheonix remember Atlantis? In Neptune's Spatula?
<CrimsonPhoenix> in PM
<Dark92Enigma> Oh OK
<CrimsonPhoenix> I know chat is dead but I don't want to invade it with this

<WallDives> hm. wonder.
<WallDives> who all would purchase skullgirls on steam here? (since you lot are mostly PC gamers.)
<Gold_Demona> I don't know what skullgirls is
<Pearly> No it was the show with sally Field
<Pearly> skullgirls is a game
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: Oh yeah! I was thinking of Widget. nvm XD
<RaveBrony> Never heard of it O.o
<StinkomanFan> Morning
<RaveBrony> Hey StinkomanFan
<Gold_Demona> morning StinkomanFan
<alexxm> how you doing StinkomanFan
<MASF123> Skullgirls.... UGH
<Vivix> never heard of skullgirls
<alexxm> MASF123 is it good
<Gold_Demona> *looks it up* Oh, it's a fighting game.
<Gold_Demona> Obviously made for guys
<RaveBrony> Oh fighting game?
<WallDives> Gold_Demona, I only care that its a fighter. >.>
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ICI8WABfE wwwuuuuttt?
<RaveBrony> I dont really care for fighting games.
<Gold_Demona> It's well animated. I'll give 'em that.
<RaveBrony> Meh
<RaveBrony> Barbetos|AtWork: Dafuq is that? :D
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, but I did know that cartoon... about the purple alien
<Vivix> Fighting games isn't my thing, and adding "girls for the sake of sales" just makes it totally uninteresting
<WallDives> I mean, I dont want to RE-BUY it is no one here is going to play it. thats why I ask.
<WallDives> Vivix, it isnt for the sake of sales, its what Alex Ahad wanted to draw. simple as that.
<Barbetos|AtWork> RaveBrony: I don't know. =o
<Barbetos|AtWork> There are not serious videos about it
<Barbetos|AtWork> But there is a channel apparently. I'd watch it
<RaveBrony> :P
<Vivix> well, I won't judge it without playing it, but scantily clad women makes me not buy games
<MadSurge> Pearly: Oooh, I watched that! :)
<Vivix> in general that is
<Jmo> Jiggle jiggle.
<MadSurge> Hey WallDives!
<WallDives> Vivix, thats all I ask. if you play fighting games, give it a run, at least.
<WallDives> and sup MadSurge.
<WallDives> also, since there isnt really any other GOOD fighters on PC...
<Vivix> I have a friend who's crazy into fighting games, maybe he knows it. He's a big guilty gear fan or something-
<Gold_Demona> I'd maybe play it if I get in the mood for a fighter, but I wouldn't pay for a game THAT full of fanservice.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WallDives, what game?
<WallDives> Skullgirls.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah
<MadSurge> Vivix: trust a noob fighter, Skulgirls is both very simple and complicated, and it's a lot of fun to play :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> I heard some good stuff from that
<WallDives> trying to spread the good word.
<MadSurge> Besides, titties don't make me buy stuff.
<WallDives> also, trying to get back at DCD for that assbeating he handed me a month or so back.
<WallDives> -_-
<MadSurge> :D
<Vivix> I haven't really played any fighters since arcades closed down
<Gold_Demona> If I wanted to see titties, I'd look in a mirror, which I don't do much anyway cuz I'm not that good looking.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> It just bugs me in games like FF, it makes no sense that they'd wear so little clothes- and it bugs me enough to avoid the game
<Pearly> MadSurge, which cartoon was that?
<WallDives> love how the first thing people go to is sex appeal.
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, you are pretty
<Pearly> :D
<WallDives> Vivix, ikr? thats why I stick to the earlier FFs...
<MadSurge> Pearly: the purple transforming alien
<Pearly> remember that
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: lol, How would you know? =P
<Pearly> MadSurge, yeah what was it called?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I bet you're more interested in abs :D
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: MadSurge: Widget. It was called Widget
<Pearly> OH, I just know so..
<MadSurge> Pearly: beats me
<Pearly> ahhh widget...
<MadSurge> Oh, there you go :D
<Pearly> haha gidget widget
<Pearly> haha
<Ihop> i know a game is good when the first thing i do is try and have sex with it
<Pearly> *giggles*
<Vivix> WallDives, hehe, yeah- I haven't played those much, but yeah
<WallDives> Ihop, thats how I know a game is bad. >.>
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> I like Alyx Vanze, she's a woman, but it's not really important that she is
<Vivix> She's an important character- you know
<Ihop> you know its bad when you can sucsede
<Gold_Demona> *succeed
<Pearly> haha I am watching MLP and they are talking to discord.. but celestia was talking to them and pinkie pie was off to the side "ph look we are famous"
<Pearly> oh*
<MadSurge> WallDives: I bought Lollipop Chainsaw because of Suda 51, zombies and Tara Strong, not for the sexy cheerleader :D
<WallDives> good lad. (I'm still waiting on MAX anarchy.)
<Vivix> I was at gamestop and saw a game named Christine, that just looked like R34 poster
<Vivix> I..walked away slowly
<Jmo> lolchristine
<StinkomanFan> Because seeing Twilight Sparkle kill zombies with a chainsaw is worth 60 dollars alone.
<Jmo> dat game
<Vivix> I have noo idea what that game is about, it might be good, but the boxart scared me away
<WallDives> you shouldnt jusge a game by its cover, but bad covers costs millions in sales anyway. :P
<Vivix> Yeah- I'm not sure what the game is about, but hte poster was so 'porny' I just know that I could not buy that with a straight face
<CrimsonPhoenix> Christine?
<RaveBrony> Woah
<Vivix> Well, apparently Christine wasn't it's name, cause I can't find it on google
<RaveBrony> Internet derp
<MASF123> Sounds sexy
<CrimsonPhoenix> Catherine
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nice puzzle game
<Vivix> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> with some crazy dating sim story
<Vivix> I mean the wallpaper for the game is her with her legs spread to the camera- and some guy blocking it
<CrimsonPhoenix> well I guess the dreams are more crazy then the actual dating sim part
<Vivix> it might be really cool dark and surreal, but- yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's like 8 ending in that game
<Vivix> so it's a fun game?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErv6ol6ZC0
<WallDives> and then people played visual novels where theres like 30 endings.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it is quite
<CrimsonPhoenix> and kinda hard
<EggWhite> It's a pretty fun game, although I suck at the puzzles.
<Ihop> Geneforge is a great game
<Vivix> problem is, I'm not fan of straightromance in my fiction
<Vivix> but- puzzles are fun
<Vivix> so I miight check it out of its on sale on steam or something some day
<MASF123> Catherine is a good game.
<MASF123> Very difficult however
<Jmo> wut^
<MASF123> They made a Free DLC which is "Very Easy" mode.
<MASF123> Just because the difficulty was hard on Easy Mode.
<CrimsonPhoenix> well the story is about a guy that cheated on his GF that wants to move their relationship so now the guy is stuck between the two and has to choose his action
<MASF123> Also she's pregnant. Lol.
<CrimsonPhoenix> mind you he unintentionally cheated
<CrimsonPhoenix> brunk and all
<CrimsonPhoenix> drunk**
<Vivix> I would still leave my guy if he got drunk and cheated, if I had any
<MASF123> Katherine is his childhood friend and girlfriend, she wants to mary but Vincent doesn't want that commitment.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but one girl doesn't know about the other
<EggWhite> Vivix: I don't think its on steam, I believe it's only for 360 and PS3.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<Vivix> ahh, I don't have either
<WallDives> also, other things.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 360 and PS3
<CrimsonPhoenix> FUNFACT
<MASF123> It's on Xbox and PS3.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I got the shirt of the game :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the pillowcase....and the boxers
<MASF123> CrimsonPhoenix, do you have Vincent's boxers?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> warning
<MASF123> LOL. I want those. They look like the one Arthur wears from Ghouls N Ghosts. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> not recommend to use as actual boxers
<WallDives> lol.
<Vivix> I bought a MERRII cd , Identiy colelctors edition, it came with young girl panties
<Vivix> japanese bands are weird
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I wear the shirt occasionaly
<Jmo> o.o
<MadSurge> MASF123: Boo, Catherine on easy mode :D
<MASF123> Vivix, Japanese bands are uber weird to me
<Vivix> I grew up with almost only japanese music
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think I got the game on normla
<Vivix> not anime related, but yeah
<MASF123> MadSurge what do you mean?
*Jmo pokes Vivix
<Jmo> DAFUQ did you do with them.
<MadSurge> MASF123: I always skip Easy mode :D
<Vivix> I put them on the cd, I can't throw out collectors items ;__;
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok this discussion convince me
<EggWhite> I'm in the UK, so it got released about a year after, and I only had a 360, so I couldn't import the deluxe edition
<CrimsonPhoenix> I NEED to continue my game
<Jmo> >__>
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh yeah
<Vivix> They were'nt used, and I doubt they were made to be worn
<CrimsonPhoenix> I bought Dragon's Dogma recently
<MASF123> MadSurge all I said was it was complained in the review that the game was too difficult, so they made an Very Easy mode difficulty.
<Jmo> It's just the thought of what in the hell would YOU of done with them.
<MASF123> It's a free DLC
<Vivix> Hehe, IIi didn't do nothing, but I'm pretty sure tons out there did
<EggWhite> CrimsonPhoenix: Is that game any good, the demo was good albeit easy.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't know
<MadSurge> MASF123: I did it on normal, without a guide. Got the ending I wanted, even if my brain was starting to overheat on certain puzzles :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was too busy playing Dust to care
<Vivix> Whenever I come home from gamestop, I get games that lay in their plastic for months
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol
<Vivix> 3for2!
<Vivix> So cheap!
<CrimsonPhoenix> so tempting
<MASF123> MadSurge, I'm not saying it can't be completed on Normal or Hard Just saying they released a Very Easy mode because of people saying the game was too hard. Jesus Christ.
<Vivix> That's where I buy games I'm curious about, but don't want to pay full price for
<WallDives> Vivix, uh....who doesnt?
<Pearly> Gold_Demona, remember fantastic max?
<MadSurge> MASF123: whiny babies IMHO :D besides, it's ATLUS.
<Vivix> I know, right?
<WallDives> ATLUS is the truth.
<WallDives> just saying.
<MadSurge> Pearly: you mean MIGHTY Max :D
<Gold_Demona> Pearl: Nope. Don't remember any Fantastic Max. I remember a Mighty Max, though.
<MASF123> MadSurge what about ATLUS?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still have that stupid Pizza box
<MadSurge> MASF123: they're notorious for releasing hard as bricks games
<MASF123> oh
<MASF123> Well never heard of them until Catherine so...
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh gosh if only I could stream that shi
<WallDives> first atlus game I played was Snowboard Kids.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, Persona?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shin Megami Tensei?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Snowboard Kids?
<WallDives> DEMON SOULS.
<EggWhite> Catherine kicked my ass, but I eventually got through it, and it felt very rewarding, bur I don't think I should have played on hard on my first playthrough
<MadSurge> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> DEMON SOULS YES
<MadSurge> EggWhite: nope :D
<MadSurge> Even the third party Atlus games are hard, like Demon Souls
<Dovah> 'Morning everypony
<EggWhite> I think I saw every stage atleasted 80 times. But I prevailed!
<Dovah> Oh god demon's souls...
<MadSurge> EggWhite: at least the music is awesome :)
<Jmo> It b Dovah
<Dovah> it b Jmo
<EggWhite> MadSurge: True true.
<MASF123|> Sorry...disconnected what were you saying ChrimsonPhoenix?
*Dovah cookies and pie for breakfast = :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> MASF123, I was just stating some games from Atlus
<EggWhite> All this talk about Atlus makes me wanna play Persona 3: FES again, but my ps2 died...because I played to much Persona on it
<MASF123|> I only heard of Persona because YuriofWind talked about it and people won't shut up about it.
<MASF123|> I know it's an ATLUS game however.
<MASF123|> The main character shoots himself in the head activating his "Persona"
<MASF123|> It's similar to Final Fantasy's turn style gameplay.
<MASF123|> turn based
<MadSurge> MASF123|: think Pokemon for adults too, because you can win over some enemies into joining you :D
<MASF123|> For Adults? :S
<MadSurge> MASF123|: you either bribe them or talk them into it
<WallDives> I want to play persona 4, but no PS2.
<WallDives> q_q
<WallDives> so i CAN MAKE SENSE OF PS4A
<MadSurge> WallDives: I could play it, but can't find the game!
<MASF123|> The music is like some Japan culture pop music I heard.
<Dovah> ded chat? no stream? ???
<MASF123|> i guess
<Vivix> prettycalmyeah
<alexxm> a bit of both Dovah but how are you doing
*Vivix space fail
<Dovah> alexxm: borded
<alexxm> huh ded cha
<alexxm> where is everyone
<Vivix> I was playing music, done and tired now
<Gold_Demona> We're all ded
<WallDives> yay, dead.
<Dovah> I am waiting for conversation to start so I can get my morning lolz :|
<WallDives> (mfw I almost used color for 'dead')
<Vivix> hehe
<WallDives> INSTAKICKGO
<Vivix> There was a long gameconvo but it's over now
<WallDives> yep.
<Dovah> i missed a game convo? wtf... :|
<WallDives> yep.
<Vivix> About japanese puzzle games I think
<Dovah> that makes me a sad pa- um pony :(
<Pearly> MadSurge, yeah
<WallDives> I know I started it with skullgirls, and then it went off on its own.
<Vivix> yeah
<WallDives> because we were talking about oversexualized covers.
<Pearly> that show was weird
<WallDives> which lead to catherine.
<WallDives> Pearly, what show?
<Vivix> Mighty Max?
<MadSurge> Mighty Max>

<MadSurge> Hey guys, preordered the first FiM comic issue :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nice
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder hwo long before it shows up as a pdf on the internet
<WallDives> ikr.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now i kind of wis hI would of gotten some of the game cards that came out
<Barbetos|AtWork> what with the cease and disist order from hasbro and all
<WallDives> I'm kinda glad it hasnt.
<WallDives> dont want it to be EVERYWHERE. that would accelerate the fan burnout.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am not all that big on collecting pony things
<Barbetos|AtWork> I would be just fine with a t shirt
<Barbetos|AtWork> and maybe a plush
<Barbetos|AtWork> I blame wednesday for dead chat.
<WallDives> maybe.
<WallDives> also, school restarting, and whatnot...
<Wrek> 05might start stream in a minute
<Wrek> 05depends on how long this takes
<MadSurge> Wrek stream, yes!
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh yeah
*MadSurge quietly hopes for more Doom
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wanted to go back to school but my full time job ruined that. =\ That and I did not try very hard to get back into a class, but that is besides the point XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> MadSurge: Brutal Doom is so awesome
<Barbetos|AtWork> I should install it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am so glad id does what they do with their source code, or we would never get awesome stuff like Brutal Doom
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder what people would do wit hthe source code of id tech 4
<alexxm> probably make they're own doom games
<Barbetos|AtWork> You don't see a lot of stand alone games coming from the source code
<Barbetos|AtWork> Althought id tech 3 had an awesome game
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://tremulous.net/ that
<Barbetos|AtWork> lots of fun
<Barbetos|AtWork> Humans v aliens
<MASF123|> Alien vs. Hunter
<Barbetos|AtWork> Speaking of Humans V Aliens I can't wait for Natural Selection 2 to be completed
<Barbetos|AtWork> its taking FOREVER though
<Barbetos|AtWork> just like black mesa source
<NocturnalBlade> afternoon everypony :)

<Dovah> but i like first person games, but DA has a great story imo...
<Dovah> what do i do!!!??!
<twilight_sprinkle> im not sure, but if you have high enough illusion you could try to keep healing/couraging the guards to kill dragons
<MASF123> Wrek, you said you've been kicked many times, but BerryPunch said 0 times last time I checked.
