and TWO dreams and we're even into it a half hour
I think we should've watched Inception :3
Yeah, fuck this.
don't forget the doubleflashback
See you NocturnalBlade, MLP_Brovakiin, AJIsAwesome, Obsidian
Oh and when you do wake up, ponies. never. happened.
flashbackception?
I fully support a WMC for this movie.
WindWhistler|AFK: the first time a few weeks back on Bstate :) but i still don't really like it. sorry. just my opinion
AHAHA THAT IRONY

Maybe she's part E.T. His heart glowed too. :D
DSNesmith: It was like tripledreamception.

Man in ugly sweater. OH NOES.
I didn't watch this movie
Eli: Well, just don't expect to see these movies without the riffing.
*actor
I opened the stream
watched the first ten minutes
Needs more Nurse Roberts.
He is so dead
skipped half an hour in
watched ten minutes
If they're really recent and bad, expect RiffTrax
dozed off
Some moveis need to be riffed or mst3k.
Or if they're critically acclaimed like Harry Potter and LoTR
woke up and watched random snippets toward the end
lol
lol Book of Mormon.
oh no
It takes a spectacularly bad movie to make me disinterested.
I mean if they're cult classics or something like that
I dunno man
WindWhistler|AFK: well... we started out without riff. but yeah...
dat office reference
04Shia Lebouf, get the fuck out of the movie

This is seriously badness taken to an art.

The perfect blend of shitty acting, shitty writing, and shitty CGI, but not too shitty because then it would be hilarious.

nothing in this movie makes a lick of sense
but seriously why is the love interest being hounded by Orochimaru in her nightmares?
She's ded. There's no way he chewed her.

Pony songs get into your brain better than gummi bears
The Die Hard movie was fine :I

reviews for this movie were basically
Eli: I just want hte commentary
"well the cgi was okay"
that last Die Hard was tepid
:D
Now we have to drag you away.
Even the CGI is played badly.
Ghosties: Except no one would care if Ahnod got to her.

Random balck cop.

She ded.
What is going on with this movie? It's all over the place.:S
He just walks in
Giant snakes in random areas. Crappy flaming swords.
Sarah
no hollywood resources
So she's not chewed up.
Where is John Conner?
Isn't he just a reporter? where does he get the authority to cross crime scene lines?
04She went to the hospital and the movie threw her around so much it fucked her up
So the husband is ded too.

the real criminal is the editor
So they just left the black guy to die? Some friends you are.
"Run me over once, shame on you. Run me over twice, shame on me."
This movie is so unintentinoally funny. And rifftrax makes it even better!:D

Quick, get every car in LA and lets get this guy
Atrox
Rise my army of BEES!

Remember kids- Always look both ways
I'm back again...............what did i miss?
he looks like the bad guy in the super mario brothers movie
...Dawdler?
I fogot what I was going to say after I watching the car scene

Dawdler?
Why didn't he do this before?
Dawdler.

ANOTHER CAR!
GET LIGHTNING!
LOL What now?
GET SNOW!
Why am I still watching this
car doesn't give a fuck

You are not prepared for Dawdler.
How come white folks can't have working magic to call upon when stuff like this happens? :(
We need more cars!
I wasn't kidding
Ghosties: i'm back what did i miss?
it's a FFXIII reject!
._.
the protag never changes expression
Hello random woman we don't know.
Dawdler. Yea I'd be pretty pissed if I was named that too.
and what happens if they hit them with a tank
This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen.
...oh, don't tell me.
spy!
He was.
SO black guy is ded.
04Suddenly, day time
i'm still laughing
insta kill
Again?
I would watch High School Musical over this.
"I'm sure he's fine"
uh… that means… something...
They really need to spycheck
04You missed a bunch of bad editing and segues, Dark92
Ghosties: I guess someone played the Sun Song.
/me at the beach.
lol That's my trait.
00,10she never asked for this
So did I lose the bet?
"I didn't ask for this role"
When did they get to the beach?!
Well, now there on a beach
04>Meanwhile
"I wanted to be an extra"
High School Musicl at least has laughably awful musical numbers
04OH U
Cause repoters don't think, right?
damn, they fast
I wonder what happens to the zookeeper.
Dark92Enigma: Welcome back!
Imagine...imagine... if the bad guys gets hit by a car a 3rd time in this movie?
Bra cast?

Bra cast.
I am actually eating Larry The Cable Guy Mac and Cheese... :O
RosePetal I wonder what happened to my sandwich
She said Bra cast.
lol he gets hit 3 times by a car.
"all these horrible creatures in my head, and stuff"
05,15When DID they get to the beach? Reikim brings up a good poin
...what was I even betting, anyway?
She didnt put all those apples in her bag either I presume Sumica.
she sounds so, so bored
So, I guess they love each other?
In my head~
being chased by some mysterious super creature? GO take a walk on the beach FUCK LAYING LOW
/me hugs AJIsAwesome
it's large
Should we call the Wesker guy something else instead of Wesker?
Not even a Rifftrax can save this, but then, I don't really enjoy Rifftrax anyway.
Yeah they is the love interest.
Rex_Mundi, Can you do that? Can you get run over thrice?
Wait, is that the guy from Dexter?
AJIsAwesome: WHAT did i miss?
AlienWarhead Alex WeskeR?
Meanwhile MANDARK?
How long has nothing been happening for noe?
*now?
OH GOD
THAT WOMAN
Oh my gosh president. The snake attacked people but nobody saw him?1
the problem with rifftrax is that they do all kinds of movies, not just really bad ones
Dark92Enigma: No I meant Dexter the serial killer not Dexter with the lab.
HAHAHA-HAHAHAHA
WHERE HAVE I SEEN HER FROM!?
Foreign? Really?
04We should call the wesker guy the villain from that one movie that was MST'd...which I can't recall ><
Dark92Enigma: Cheesy scenes and this: http://duloph.com/images%5CDragon%20Wars%5Cfence.gif
dunno Reikim, how long's the movie been on?
What do you know, Mr. Scientist!?
Nah, Rifftrax just isn't my kind of humour.
GHosties Calgon?
lOL somebody gifted it!
Seriously. Koreans get actual dragons and evil demons to throw at us, but we don't even get a couple of Biblical angels or something to even the odds? :|
Too many references.
04Was it Calgon?
ah.
Ghostie Space Mutiny
04Oh
04No
04There's another guy I'm thinking of
Calgon takes you away
Too many random replacements of lines.
This is where the fish live.
Washing machines live longer with Calgon~
I want to see the trenchcoat guy get hit by a car again
It doesn't feel linked to the movie.
00,10can we just toss them in the ocean again?
their twilight one
was hilarious
04"What if I learned how to act?"
Meanwhile: oh. Not the Michael C. Hall himself, but another character from the series?
"line"
"line"
Now, if they spent their time making fun of how bad it actually is, then that would work for me.
lol Guy gets hit by a car while playing unfitting music.

See, that would be fine.

World Maid Center
of course they referenced it, its what they do to fill up time.

I'm just honored our fandom was mentioned by Mike and the boys. :)

the pony reference
Ghosties: you love this but you hate Over the Hedge...
it exploded
WHATS GOING ON!?
/me fangirl screem
wow you guys
bill murry?
So either the villain is Kyo Kusanagi, or Nappa.
riftrax mentions MLP on a MLP fan stream
Why did they even say anything about MLP exactly??
04Because this movie isn't offensive or tasteless
man those marines had shit micro
Pale_Horse this was before MLP Generation 4 ^^'
I was not paying attention.
Random person.
Sumica: Do you know when this rifftrax was made?
they ment BEFORE FiM
MrBen uuuuuhhhh what's that mean? :P
I still don't get why everyone thinks Rifftrax are so great.
/me SQUEE
Oh. :(
I just don't see it.
I can't keep track of where the bad guy is now
Clear your mind what do you see?
Ghosties>_>
04...well...it could be offensive if you were a dragon enthusiast
babes in toyland wasn't offensive or tasteless, it was just four fucking hours long and boring as all hell
SLEEP!

The editting during the hospital scene was extremely offensive.
btw, I hope that, for S3, somebody will be recording the chat for each new episode. In case something like Derpy happens again.

Dig a little Deeper.
WE MUST GO DEEPER.
Xavior: A movie deemed to be so bad and so unwatchable that it is never, ever shown on BronyState again.
flashbaaaaack
Dhosties: Like me?
Hell yes
Sumica: Ok, thank you.
we MUST GO DERPER
Ghosties: And yet technically we have yet to see a dragon
throw her into the water
That video actually led me here.
oh I remember that
I see a kid and my daddy throwing me into the water.
god father
I missed that day
yes
04Haha, true
Ghosties*** Like me?
05,15dat Godfather
Ghosties: i'm not even an enthusiast, and it offends me
watched episode
2007, so it was G3 ponies when this movie was made.
DAT ACTING
Then I became Batman.
I SEE....DEAD....PONIES.
was like
We need to go deeper!
Ghosties: this movie is plain bad
Everybody's dead Dave. :(
"hublurblghwah!"
I wonder what else she's seeing.
00,10so she can remember this?
Xavior: Under the current clause, if we see a movie, it is eliglbe to be seen again after six months have passed, unless it gets WMC'd.
I see koreans
05,15That chat explosion was
She saw Bambi's mom get shot.
05,15hell
lol
poor AJ
I see Ponies
Ok.....RIFFTRAX/MST3K referenced MLP! This was epic
dem old fashion rocket launchers
her focus episode got completely derailed before the titles
I woke up late that day, and got spoiled by the EQD post where it just showed a picture of Derpy and said "Oh My God."
05,15"Why can't I hold all these kicks!"
GLOWY SHIT
movie is full of suck
Hwachas
yeah same RAWRity
SO we can't have asian lovers but white lovers? OH YEAH
Suddenly, Exorcist.
What kind of acting was that?!:D
I was like "okay must watch immediately"
We should stream Hercules the Legendary Journeys sometime
00,10so do you think she can understand the foren lauange she spoke in her past lafe?
Previously on DragonBallZ: KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKAROOOOOOOOOOT
the power of celestia compels you
hey main character? little emotion please? No? okay then.
Love how the man has no emotion or shock of this.
0,14I woke up late for the Derpy thing
Zffazanna?
hey guys im back
Everlasting_Joy: Much better reference.
0,14so when I jumped on
0,14first thing I saw was OMG SHE TALKED
IS this movier turned into the EXORCIST?
lol
Elit3xPon3: Welcome back!
No, you'll just die.
so... no following giant snake
The funniest thing: Last Roundup was actually a pretty good character episode for AJ.
Keanu Reeves is not a good actor to mimic
That's totally normal. Happens all the time during hypnotism. :P
GET THE TANKS!
Again nobody sees the snake.
We can totally out run it!
So...that was pointless
I quite liked it
00,10so um, how is this snake able to just show up?
"old man, get out there!" not gonna way that?
had great gags, great animation
dragons!
Guys You left him to die!
>that ILL reference
magic
05,15Reikim but Derpy stole that. Nobody paid attention to the rest of the episode
*say*
and ded
I know, right?
DED.
yeah, just a shame it got completely overshadowed by the Derpy controversy.
Kind of sad.
Dude where's my snake.
Pizza guy is best pizza guy :p
notded.
Sumica the same way Godzilla shows up+
Poor Pizza Guy.
00,10he lives!
and people have the nerve to call her a background pony
to the point where people now actively HATE the episode over the editting and whatnot.
Your muffler's dragon. Dohoho.
Hey he ain't dead?
he's not ded?!
Pizza Guy is best pony.
rarity's my fave, but I post as AJ
is that a dragon or a snake?
Poor AJ, always shafted by the fandom.
I didn't lose the bet at all!
WE need a FISH TRAP
Wait wy did it stop
another office reference
called it
lol This is the worst town ever.
Oh yeah....HES FROM THE OFFICE
seriously, you didn't tell him to get out of that house… WMC/10
poor girl needs more fans
HE'S NOT DED.
*dat another office reference
I still want the angry homeless guy to make a comeback :D
Pizza pony!
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?!
a "dragon"
/me demands 3 AJ episodes in S3
DARREL WILL LIVE
You'd think with all the surveillence we have these days the authorities would know where it is at all times . . . unless . . . The government is in on it! It's a conspiracy!
"it's headed south right now, SIGH"
Elit3xPon3: Technically its not a dragon ...yet
"it's heading south right now, SIGH"
WE NEED.........A LOTTA FISH
/me demands 1/2 an AJ episode for S3
because fuck, if Rainbow Dash can get 3, let AJ get some. and a song.
yet? dun dunn dunnnn
oh god
godzilla
I'm thinking about the actors behind sadly horrible movies like this
MLP_Brovakiin: DOn't worry. He's the main hero. He'll save the day at the end.
Dark92Enigma: :).
Midnight_Fyre: The gov would know where is was
screw that movie
One of the problems, though - as I've stated - is that one of the reasons I love AJ is why she's hard to write for.
Hey thanks for leaving me out on the cold street with a dragon on the loose. *sarcastic*
She's down to earth.
She's sensible.
She loves apples.
She's not insane.
This movie would be a lot more awesome if it was the black guy that was the reincarned destined one. :D
she loves Apples
Also she loves apples.
Dark92Enigma: :D
like they look at themself asking; why in the heck am I in here?
AJIsAwesome: Yay
/me sniggers
05,15black guy is dead. calling it
0,14oh
there's PLENTY you can do with AJ's character. Especially considering she's the only one really close to her family.
And of course, there is no major traffic jam as hundreds of thousands of people try to flee LA
In that people, they were at least able to say "Run, It's Godzilla!"
cough*hillbilly*cough
Hey, remember that dragon that was chasing us? WHy did it stop?
lol I love how the black guy only has a scratch on his head.
0,14this is where is I first saw the movie
So the giant snake is not the news right now?
But we thought he was ded.
I do want to see more AJ/Rarity episodes
well Windows Movie Make is WORTHLESS
00,10no one in the kitchen in this restraunt
they're great foils
I LOVE starbursts
it's goddamn WORTHLESS
Oh wait sorry Its not a drgon
DSNesmith: same here, it killed the King Of Monsters, but it gave us one of the greatest memes of all time: THAT'S A LOTTA FISH
guns have not worked.. why he need gun?
Anyway
Hey, Starburst are delicious
AJ and Rarity or Aj and Pinkie. They work well together.
It's just this Movie. The characters are very stupid.
Only three bullets left
Derailing this now before it turns into a Worst Episode convo.
I was trying to make a .gif of the clip of the grandma running into the wall
fluttercry: betcha he lives
dude is EVERYWHERE
wait.. black guy was old dude?
wtf
Yeah that tiny gun will help
hell, let's get a duet between Rarity and AJ
D-Wars could have worked.
What the?
and it WON'T SAVE PROPERLY
there are no worst episodes
D-Wars had an old lady walk into a fence.
Go to North Korea no one will look for you there
there are just episodes one doesn't care to rewatch
CHIMCHIM
also Princess Canada is best Princess http://i.imgur.com/yNq8F.jpg
So is black guy really dead?
That's nice dude. Do you have any emotion.
Reikim: in it's original form it could have
THIS mess is just ridiculous
Eyeup.
Just like my career.....I'M. ACTING
Worst MLP episode = SO Many Ways to Play
Hi mr. snake!
I think "mess" is an apt word
and would be unwatchable without the Rifftrax
CrimsonPhoenix HNNNGGGG
I love those cream cheese packets :D
oh god rawrity
Luna does nothing but sleep
I'm...... Acting......
that thing
Even with Rifftrax I'm having a hard time watching this.
WHY DOES NO ONE PANICKING OVER GIANT SNAKE!?
oh sheet
CrimsonPhoenix is there one for USA and the UK?
the dark, seedy, underbelly of flash animation
Yeah, don't tell anyone about the snake.
look out!! IT'S CLOVERFIELD 3000 YEARS LATER
Dragon needs his coffee too.
Car does not approve
man this snake really really sucks at killing people
They be stupid!
AlienWarhead, not that I know of
What. Thing.
suddenly snake is far behind
pet snake
that's from the BronyCan site
Run over it with a car
No those people are safe. they escaping.
HAY GUYS, Why is there a GIANT SNAKE?!?!
not alligator
Or should I even be asking?
DSNesmith: it's not worried about killing people it wants to become a GOD
...wait.. is that really black guy or old dude looking like black guy
Nice aim for a snake.
AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
04So I come back and it's the exact same way I left it
OKay, he's alive what sorcery.
it's trying to kill the protags though, otakon
RAWRity: What is that.
04With car wrecks and bad acting
DRAGON WARS
...Dummeh

DSNesmith: no it's not
Reikim: ...look up "So many ways to play" on youtube
TEAM CAR IS BLASTING OFF AGAINNNNNNNNNNN!
well it's trying to eat girl lady

ULTIMATE! WARRRRRRRRRRRRRIIOR!!!!!!!!!!!
Bulcos
Why am I watching this
You are here because the outside world rejects you.
and the ponies look like dinosaurs
NOW they panick
now I'm hoping we see some actual military effort. Missiles, anti-tank guns, etc.
Reikim: watch the baby ponies instead.
Reikim because you tough urself at night
Und dann the snake was Ghosties.
Oh good. the ACTUAL dragons. :D
I hate Newborn Cuties
WWF classic reference
pony_300: we will
Pale_Horse: enope

*touch
FEEL THE POWER OF THE WARRIOR
Pale_Horse: Chinese Dragons look like snakes
04>:i

04>:I

Andy Dick joke :D
/me starts playing "Touch Myself"
so ... where is the good dragon?
otakon: I was actually hoping not. Not I have to give this movie some more credit. :(
Stratadons, hide the ponies! Keep them safe from Tirak!
God
god this song is terrible
Come my minons rise from your master. Let your power shine. Find them now yes FLy ever faster. In the dark of the night they'll be MINE!

/me puts on some barry white

>yfw the movie is louder than the riffs for once.

Dark92Enigma: not really
suddenly the movie is much more bearable
It's Godzilla ripoff.
And King Kong ripoff.

So this is the B-movie?
Flee!
WHERE IS THE GODDAMN MILITARY?
04And Transformers

otakon: Point taken.....it's a KING KONG ripoff
Dragon crawls...?
Do I get something if I do?

Fuck no
.... jUmp?
No cookie is worth it
04"Um, excuse me, that's an amphibean. Not a reptile :s"
Thousands of people are dying and your running away!
Reikim: it's a lemon cookie
JUMP
and she does it
did they died?
The snake can still eat us though
You could make that cookie out of goddamn miracles and I still wouldn't watch it.
I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD!
ded
WTF
YOU HAVE TO JUMP AND SACRIFICE YOURSELF!
the size of a hub cap
no.. fing way.. they survied that jump
good jump?
ROFL, that was a 40 foot jump
Ded.
so where the fuck is the good snake?
how are thier legs not shattered?
Ghosties: Over the Hedge reference
what jerks
...What was the point of this?
Yeah. That'll help lady... :P
04And then Shao Kahn came
Logic. Don't question it.
pony_300: I know! And she's perfectly fine!
KHAAAAAAAAAAN
05,15YOUR SOULS ARE MINE
It's official, you suck.
Deadlypon3: it needs to eat her to become a dragon
I will watch D-War over Newborn Cuties.
Chuck Norris will save the day!
I AM THE ETHERNAL DRAGON STATE YOUR WISH
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Dark92Enigma: And probably the only one.:D
00,10ah 64 D's
Reikim: and thus, my work is done
Bewborn Cuties is the only thing worse than this.

04All the villains are getting involved in this movie!
This is a crappy day indeed.
hmm, Thunder clouds
oh two
APACHE!
WE HAVE COVER ART! :D
FIRE!
that will help
guns still just pissing it off
I AM YOUR GOD NOW BRING ME YOUR VIRGINS
Oh NOW the fucking military shows up
Where's the hobo when you need him?!
This snake is stupid.
Stop! Guns not working.
we need Rambo! Rambo vs Giant Snake!
They would not fly that close. EVER
And nobody has fired rockets at it yet
00,10use the rockets
AJIsAwesome: You promised he would ,a
EAT THE GIRL. BECOME A GOD. THEN GO AFTER THE CHOPPERS>
Reikim what about BITL
ITS RAINING SPENT SHELLS
I want the lady that ran into the fence to come back
04Zap it with your laser gun!
> have ranged weapons > move to within biting range.
ded
BITL?
*make a comeback :(
I think one well placed bunker buster would do the trick
AIM FOR THE HEAD!
04Hit it with your zappy gun!
Isn't that the same building the Independence Day aliens blew up first?
Midnight_Fyre: civilians, plus close to building...nvm
Well that is easy
this is a pussy dragon
The hobo is secretly the commander of the military.:O
yes
We need Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and KING KONG.
Babes in Toyland
ZOWWY POW POW!
Haven't seen it.
well it is certainly hurting it
9/11 JOKE ABORTED
Thank God.
Man, THAt WAS easy
ZOMBIE CANCER?
That movie killed people.
oh wow the humans weapons actually did something this time
RAWRity do not say that name, it is forbidden
ugh
babes
No jokes about the said event.
It is the worst thing that has ever been on here.
Meanwhile: who?
babes is the worst movie I have ever seen
BULCOS!
05,15More dragons!
and I've seen some bad movies
YEAH HAH! *highfives Rustymeat*
So now the snake is getting attacked by bullets.
fluttercry: Bulcos
birdemic
Meanwhile: just wait until I get to choose B movie...
See, if the movie had STARTED with a scene like this, then CONTINUED with a scene like this, it just MIGHT have been bearable.
FLY MY PRETTIES FLY FLY!
RosePetal: hight caliber bullets
fluttercry: nope not dragons
now the weirdest movie we've ever seen on here
hmmmm
LOL
I'd vote Vampire's Kiss
FAIL PILOT
04Suddenly, MechWarrior
otakon: military precision. with its head in the air they can blow it right off without hurting anyone more than would be hurt anyway from the body rolling over due to other modes of killing it
Meanwhile: then you all get to see...NUDIST COLONY OF THE DEAD
mechs!
mechs outta know where?
I was never sure whether it was a comedy, a thriller, or a horror movie
:I
Dam it sign you killed them.
Midnight_Fyre: bad movie :P
So where did our "heros" go
SUE THEM MY PRETTIES! SUE THEM SUE THEIR ASSES
That's a thing?
but it was hilariously creepy the entire time
And now he's a six-star wanted :P
RAWRity: That one sounds So Bad It's Good.
NocturnalBlade: enope, Dawdlers
pistols wont do shit
Meanwhile: it's quite a thing. It has musical numbers.
right behind you
ITS A TRAP!
acting!
dammit, I forgot the opening exposition. I have no idea what's going on
otakon: much more logical explanation
oh my
Equal opportunity killing. :P
04Hot Top Gun!
I have to admit, gatling cannon mounted dinosaurs are pretty cool.
sounds entertaining
00,10I am sure there are no people in the city at all
...
It has musical numbers.
and THEY are not bullet proof
IT'S A TRAP
Reikim: there'sa scene where a forest ranger does a rap song about people getting eaten by zombies
Oh dear.
There no heroes. They are letting innocent people die. They are lettting the innocent die!
did we ever see Night of the LEpus
Boom
Late explosion is in poor taste.
hench the " marks
We need puff the magic dragon!
Fuck yes RAWRity. I am voting that for B next time, just to boost your chances.
xD
or Lost Skeleton of Cadavra
XD
We need Spike!
that one's a classic
Hey remember those two main characters? Do we even care where they are
we need ponies
rofl that chopper pilot's still alive
a modern B-movie
Pyro.
i dont get this movie :s
please
Spike would run too.
the sequel was great too
RosePetal How would you react if you had to fight dragons?
we should watch Human Centipede
not the Night of the Lepus
04How much money did they waste on this movie
RosePetal: and they're feeding the dragon,.......:D......all those innocent lives...:'(....yeah, they're dicks
wait
I would be scared but I wouldnt run away.
AlienWarhead, I would send out Fluttershy
Well
whoops
lol
how come he was using a REVOLVER?
ded
UHm...
ded
00,10I love the pilot, leting go of the stick to cover his face
WAHT
Ghosties: about 70 million
FINALLY TANKS!
Revolver is best pony :3
They Porsche 911'd that building
lol
04All them special effects
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SHOWING HIM GETTING OUT IF HE DIED ANYWAY!
alive but then explosion killed XD
MICHAEL BAY WAS HERE
big guns
>Pulls out gun to shoot dragon. >Crashes into building anyway.
05,15Rifftrax is saving the hell out of this movie
Ghosties: Micheal Bay is getting a chubby right now
Why are human weapons always useless?
The dragons and miltary have a fast reaction time
fluttercry: agreed
THANKS FOR THE EXPOSITION
>Initially survives. >Helicopter blows up two seconds later anyway.
otakon: And he has no idea why.
"I'm expositing right now in case some people still don't get it"
Helicopter crashed into building. Uhhhhhhhhhh, not trying to make offensive joke here.
yes otakon, the same
04Yes, rifftrax is really saving this film
meh, rifftrax is putting me to sleep as always..
What are those? STAR WARS REJECTS?
Mr. Schue.
fluttercry: true dat
Who the hell wrote this movie? I wish to find him so I can smack him.
"just in case the audience doesn't know what's going on anymore"
They spent 70 million on this movie, and grossed 53 million... Fail
to be fair
Suddenly Episode 1 flashbacks
by the last 20 minutes of transformers 2
Yes, because shooting them will work.
We have to swallow our pride and ask Canada for reinforcements with their genetically revived dinosaur forces... :|
I had no clue what the plot was anymore
05,15Mann co?
XylemTube: no idea why :P
Oh look there are our "heroes"
MANN CO.!
that's 1 kill
some exposition would have been nice
WE NEED THE HEAVY!
Roger Mangoat?
Yeah, but you don't watch Bayformers for plot.
Dragon ded.
Ghosties: I think I warned everyone enough yesterday so no one had there hopes up. :D
How did they get in the underground
instead of that contrived "run through the desert" scene
is this commentary live?
lol
Don't bring logic.
05,15Where's Gondor?
Their**
RosePetal: they're not heroes, they're ROBOTS
also why are they still bothering with anything less than explosive ordinance and the like? Running around with machine guns at this point is laughable
CCCP: no prerecorded
If you are watching Bayformers for plot you are sadly misguided.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ngz1yCjk1rfqf4io1_500.png
Let's run away! That's all we can do run!
otakon ok
pony_300: first response team?
wtf is Bayformers
The Imoogi ate Gondor. :(
RUN TO THE HILLS
pony_300: nearest unit I would guess
FOR TOTAL GLOBAL SATURATION, CHARGE
DESTROY EVERYONE.
How are they MISSING?
HOW DID THEY MISS?
Transformers as directed by Michael Bay.
Anypony wanna panic with me?
pyrocatboy: :3
Distinguishes it from every other iteration of Transformers.
Logic don't question it.
also, NO WAY IN HELL THEY'RE ALL BULLET PROOF
AIM FOR THE HEADS
twilight_sprinkle: Random snarky remarks make everything better.
We need Spartans!
TERRIBLE AIM
Cloverfield reference
Explosion?
and the Bulcos SHOOT FIREBALLS
ok, 50 cal machine guns AND THEY STILL MISS?
... another hasbro joke
yes yes it will
my biggest problem with bayformers isn't the lack of plot or the overabundance of explosions
I AGREE!
…or will it?
DaringDerpy: not if they arent funny, and are the same in every movie
They shot that dragon perfectly.
it's that he focuses on the human characters no one cares about
Dats true.
oh man. I go to fix router problems during hospital drama and return to ROCKET DINOS
TWarTovlerWars: IT IS CLOVERFIELD....Only 3000 years later
There's that too.
the transformers are just set pieces
Dark knight truck.
Blow up all the Cars!
also
Should have axed Witwicky after the first movie.
>shia labeouf
HOW DO THEY KEEP MISSING?
Headshot
:D
and ofc it HITS THE HELMET
twilight_sprinkle: actually, when these guys were sitting in my cinema, I would have punched them in the face by now
FBI good or bad
we only came for giant robots beating the shit out of each other
Somewhere Michael Bay is having an Orgasm and dosen't know why. :D
and the creature is fine
one thing I'm enjoying is that atleast the military is actually effective
BOOM HEADSHOT
Dark92Enigma: oh yeah, they did say that.
this is the fifth car they've jumped into
My thoughts on the third movie are thus:
Our heroes everyone, they run away and let innocent people die.
also, WHY ARE THE SOLDIERS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE GODDAMN TANKS?
lawl at korea
Way to fucking go:|
weird. The movie is now louder than the riffs.
lol at NK vs SK
:D
Seriously, stand BEHIND THE TANKS
Wilhelm #2
DaringDerpy: me too, tbh
Wilhelm
WILHELM
more wilhelm
You can skip roughly a third of it and not miss anything.
05,15Wihelm again?
04Yeah, more wilhelm
Dragon scale armor
WILHEML
WILHEIM!
WILHELM!
Wilhelm x2!
Wilhelm!!!
usually in movies like this when ancient magics or technology faces off with current age weapony, current age gets curbstomped
:o
Wilhelm again.
RosePetal: if they're not heroes, WHO ARE WE SUPOSSED TO ROOT FOR
TWarTovlerWars: tuff stuff
bye bye LA
That third being anything involving LaBoeuf and his retarded girlfriend.
also, ONE Wilhiem scream per movie!
WILHELM!!!!!
I want to see a movie where modern day stuff completely owns the ancient enemies
I am so bored of the mindless action I am falling alseep...
otakon: and light too
like, the army of mummies charges an artillery line
DSNesmith: it'll never happen
and vanishes
The zookeeper guy. He's the real hero Dark92Egima.
Why is this boring dragons vs miltary should be more fun
lol
Bulcos
Okay, I just got back... and what the hell is this? Why is this the most ridiculous thing I've seen? Dragons with missile launchers on their backs? Normally, I'd say that this is the coolest thing ever, but this movie manages to make that look absurd...
Maybe they should have used the tanks against the dragons and the helicopters against the ground army.
Cuz it's predictable.
to much CGI in the way
Who directed this shit? MICHAEL BAY!?
pony_300: That diddnt happen in the Fullmetal alchemist movie
Is this movie banned after this? :D
We're bad
huh, what's going on now?
Well at least he killed the dragon.
the weird thing is
RosePetal yeah
Mozdoc: not Dragons, Dawdlers and Bulcos(flying creatures)
oh shit the movie remembered it had a plot it was supposed to be following
i don't know.
labeouf can be a good actor
they are the MIB?
Still, I enjoy Bayformers for the beautiful giant robots beating seven types of hell out of each other, and shit blowing up.
the car though
how far are we through the movie?
the movie will be banned but the rift wont
I really genuinely liked him in Holes
First 45 minutes of Transformers 3: Shia Lebouf looking for a fucking job.
LaBoeuf? Good?
The dragon FBI
so the Government ofc KNEW THE WHOLE GODDAMN TIME
Oh, Holes.
About 20 minutes left
That was good.
i knew it was the FBI
The Rifftrax is not banned but the real movie is.
Soooo... how come the government dosent have any other viable paranormal soulutions? :/
Idiot
he ded
Disturbia was good too, though not as good as the hitchcock film
He's not a bad actor, it's just that Sam Witwicky is a god awful character
where is this "good imoogi" anyway?
also
HE DEED
^
EVERYONE USES REVOLVERS
he missed
no emotion at all
He ded.
THE Goverment.......is EEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLL
He's not dead
but in bayformers and indiana jones
seriously WHY?
fucking awful
Use your dragon shout
what a tweest
No emotions at all.
um what
SuperBrony64:
I am dead.......you can tell the way i cat
ded.
LOLWHAT
Too be fair, a lot of things in Crystal Skull were stupid.

is it buffering alot for you guys too?
*To
he was shot in the shoulder
wat....
So many Dovahkiin born today...
05,15It's like Reservoire Dogs...but crappy
hes dragonborn, he dont care about bullets
It was just a bullet no big deal
yet NO WOUND
wow, i felt sorry for the FBI agent, and not the main character getting shot
Rex_Mundi: not at all
I changed my mind. Let us run into the Sunset.
Rex_Mundi: Yes
I see no blood
fluttercry: I thought the same thing
Rex_Mundi: no
Rex_Mundi: it was, until I rebooted my router ...
ROFL, shot in the arm, takes 5hp damage.
ugh the acting, facehoof*
yeah okay a bullet hits him and he's like IM OKAY NO WORRIES IM TOTALLY FINE
How is he not ded?
00,10fate is what you make
brb, dinner time
YES DOOM MORE PEOPLE
Why not go the opposite way? To Canada?
I went to see it with my aunt
Get a plane to Korea Already
>Gets shot. >Stands up with no blood, no wound.
SUDDENLY MEXICO
who's awesome
Fate is your destiny :|
Mexico is your destiny.
we both get in
sit down
Reikim such as
The cold would slow down the giant snake, due to being coldblooded.
pull up popcorn
mmmm dogs
SUDDENLY i have a flamethrower
04Dude, Combos are awesome
Just keep going to populated cities and slaughter them all!
Yes go to Mexico where more innocents will die.
movie starts, we're like "okay, area 51"
I don't think they show any wounds in this
lady gets out of car
SUDDENLY i go up to the projectors booth and set fire to the film
walks up to jones
just people dying
The Hamburger combos are a bit weird
0,14combos?
sticks her hand on his head
Wait, why are they going to Mexico?
00,10suddnly
"I can read your thoughts, dr. jones"

Happy fucking birthday :|

Crystal Skull COULD have been good.

And then Micheal bay CAME again
DED
No, the dragons don't want to cross the border. . . For some reason.
DEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDEDE
Just like D-Wars.
Gah to much explosions and CGI
HAHAHAHAHAH the main characters are invincible
its whole premise was flawed
dat Wanda
Also, can't believe I'm older than the female lead :S
It COULD have works.
Cuz no matter where you go the army follows you and more innocents die. And yet you are cowards, and can't act for crap so why don't you surrender yourself so no more innocents die?
HULK OUT?
*worked
KEKEKEKEK
indiana jones is about religious artifacts
BULLSHIT
not aliens
Ded.
See, there's the problem.
BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT
lolol
Hey look! They found Gondor!
No emotions at all.
why no kill him?
DaringDerpy: she's basically the chosen one that can be sacrificed to an Imoogi to grant it diety status
also
Everlasting_Joy they don't have passports
Remove the aliens, rework the plot, presto! problem solved.
too many action scenes
Mordor?!
not enough archeology scenes
This is a Korean movie? where is the starcraft?
Mordor!
YOU CANNOT SURIVE A FUCKIN EXPLOSION
We're in Mordor suddenly
AlienWarhead: :) That.
Now they will be tortured.
And now they're over there now.
DaringDerpy: except more than one Imoogi wants that power, and the evil one wants it
05,15SARAH
Oh wait is Mordor, nevermind
ITS AT LEAST 500 F
Somehow the woman lived from a car crash.
Part of the reason I like the first is because they actually get a lot of things right about the Ark.
crusaders had the snake bit, the first scene, and the face melting scene
SARAH.
KAGOME!
05,15SHAUN
Darth Vader? What the fuck...
THAT is why she wasn't killed
seriously, is there any in plot reason why this guy and the girl are able to take so much damage?
oh, thx, otakon
Also, WHEN THE HELL DID THEY GET THIS?
05,15TETSUO!
RosePetal: All he has to do is take the grl to the cave and sacrifice her
Kaaaaahn!

INNUYASHA.

Noisy, bad acting, letting those guys die, poor tone goofyorsrs. 0/10
Ghosties: without Rifftrax would you say it was better than A?
I like the shitty font they're using
Well, that was silly. But I'm really tired.
SARAH!/10
Ghosties: Can we WMC the non-rifftrax version?
Night everyone.
that's a surefire sign of "we have no idea how to spend our budget"
Lead Actor no emotions/10
huh, it's using the same papyrus font avatar used

aww
Not even the Rifftrax could completely save that, I'll be really honest.

I loved the anti-globalization protestor jab though.
even though it had nothing to do with the game
niiiight
bye MLP_Brovakiin
See you Brovakiin
Reikim: there were some fnny moments but yea...not saved
Night MLP_Brovakiin
it was still a good movie
well it made NO sense
Night Meanwhile
take care MLP_Brovakiin
4/10: the military versus heavily armed dragons scene were somewhat enjoyable for me.
Meanwhile: Night!
But what about the zookeeper?
what game?
but the papyrus
MLP_Brovakiin: Night!
seriously, THEY'RE USING FUCKING PAPYRUS. THIS IS WORSE THAN AVATAR.
drove me bonkers
d
it had NOTHING to do with a game
See ya MLP_Brovakiin

It always annoys me to see the military always curbstomped in films with alien races
PONIES
I didn't hear the full MLP reference during the military invades the cave scene was it "My Little PonyConvention"
Hearth's Warming Eve
So can we go right now and assign a WMC on the non-Rifftrax version of this?
Midnight_Fyre: was talking about PoP
Why does this music sound so epic?
SpadeMagnes[R]: I agree
dies irae
not this festering pile of snake crap
The music is SO MUCH better than the actual movie.
tell me this movie's going on the ban list
still, the main character had a personality more stoic than keanu reeves, and no explanatin for why he was taking so much shit effortlessly and without a scratch.
Oh, OK. Still not a great film, but nothing to be horribly ashamed of like if you meant this
I warned every pony it was terrible. :D No one listened!
RosePetal1 a orchestra can make anything sound epic, bonus point if it also has a latin chourus
I listened. :P
seeing as we can't find a proper copy of this movie, I'd say this movie WMC'd itself.
Best Boy Grip?
The non Rifftrax of this movie will be WMC. But the Rifftrax version lives on.
mmm
Prince of Persia would have been better if they'd stuck to the game's plot.
pony_300: bullet doesn't phase him
The point of a b movie is to be terrible right?
Just sawe that in the credits
The new plot was kind of lacklustre.
Rookeealding: Yep.
>Special Effects Coordinator
pony_300: car crash knocks him out for apparently days
yeah, just the prince and the girl wandering through ruins
That Zookeeper was sadly the only thing good about it.
Rookeealding: no it's not
Pale_Horse: Thanks~ 6_9
the new plot was meh
otakon http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ni03zXsg1rfqf4io1_500.png
>Edward Surkis you should be ashamed
NP.
although I admit, I fell for the "brother did it" ruse
I hereby motion that the non-Rifftrax D-War be put on the WMC list. All in favour?
LOL, Riftrax is so awesome! This movie had now redeeming qualities without it! :D
Rookeealding: the point of a B moive is to be a cult hit or a cheap movie that is still good
Rookeealding it doesn't have to be horrible, it could either be of low production or a cult following
Sure seems like it some time
was genuinely surprised when the bad guy turned out to be the obviously evil bald dude
Reikim: AGREED!
Aye.
Rookeealding: not that terrible. xD
Man....
yes
also it had great credits music
Agreed
00,10now now, this movie did have two good parts
Can we discuss how bad the heroes were?
I came at the end of the damn movie...
and that one guy
uh
00,10the old woman walking in to the fence
India's massive budget movie was way better than South Koreas
Sumica: can we put the NON Rifftrax version of this on WMC?
alec baldwin?
no
shoot
here's my issue with the Prince of Persia move
Sumica: perfect
*movie
00,10and the guy geting hit by two cars
...why did that woman run ito a fence?
Sumica: yeah within a minute of each other
Sumaia yea the villian getting hit with a car twice
getting blown up in a fuckin car traveling at high speed, makes him PASS OUT without a scratch on him. The fucker is Clark Kent.
whatsisname
xD
yep
I will admit, the fence-woman was hillarious. :D
I didn't think it was that bad. Wasn't good, but wasn't bad either
Damn, Rex_Mundi, that is sexy :3
But seriously, that does not defend the movie.
The End... Was Riftrax comentary the other part? :D
Lol Sumica you are right those were the only things I found amusing.
molina
uh
Because the guy walked through a fence
alfric?
Right, I'm duckin' on out. Later, y'all!
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ni03zXsg1rfqf4io1_500.png
okay
In the opening, the king sees his servant beating a young boy. Does nothing. Another boy stands up for his friend. Makes him a prince.
But the movie still sucks though.
Hell, if we hadn't had Rifftrax, half the chat would be leaving in disgust.
alfred
how come HE can type forever and a day
Night MrBen!

What is WMC?

Worst Movie Clause

Worst Movie Clause.
THE FUCKING HELL!
Im going to go get food. I'll probably return shortly.
Reikim: rifftrax makes me leave in disgust anyway
hey otakon just be grateful they took the autoban off
weren;t we suppose to be watching over the hedge?
otakon: do not anger the Daribot
I got banned three times during the babes in toyland stream alone
Worst Movie Clause. So far only Babes in Toyland and Epic Movie have been WMCD.
superretroworld: Watched that earlier for A.
Is there anything in FAQ about WMC?
twilight_sprinkle: fuck you
superretroworld: been there done that, movies start at 7
superretroworld I think that played first
without rifftrax, I would have had forgetten the plot entirely.
Why does this music seem so epic.
No, I mean that her face is kind of appealing in that face :$
Rookeealding: Yes.
oh
superretroworld: That was the A-movie
Similar to the Santa Clause, except in the ways in which it's completely different. :P
the rifftrax got much better as the movie went on... either that or I reached a point where I mentally blocked out all but their top jokes.
I am dead freaking serious about WMC'ing this.
Dr_Fumbles: ^_- okay?
*Picture, not face at the end :S
what Dr_Fumbles said
....no, fuck it, those jokes were horrendous.
00,10so is every one checking out that 'blue" moon?
Reikim: so am I
Sumica: one sec!
blue moon's looking real dirty yellow
twilight_sprinkle: okay. I loled
gotta love cleveland
also, do you realize how hard it is to find a 2390*768 wallpaper in the internet?
looks white to me
My mate is coming over tomorrow. He thinks I was bullshitting him about being a brony. Wit till he sees my AJ barn set
The MST3K guys kept bringing up the Imoogi and Yuijoh, which would have just been forgotten otherwise.

Anyway, WMC on D-War now. I will not change my stance on this.

SaxyPretender: now it's Luna Eclipsed or Party of One
Polydunami: maybe it has, idk :P
Sumica I think they may be tied
Because apperently this predates Celestia who's centuries old

So arrogent
Well I am off to bed. Night everyone.
SpadeMagnes[R] some counties are older than a thousand years
I'm back.............................and THE MOVIE IS OVER!????????????
like, it's to the point where I kind of have a knee jerk reaction to hate luna, just because this fandom creams itself over her so much.
PLOT!
Oh Rainbow...so full of yourself...
night Barbetos

Yup. Elements of Harmony.
SSSSHHHH
The days of G1
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
If spike was a pony, I think his cutie mark would be Communication related. Narrator, Announcer and secretary
Luna and Trixie.
This reminds me of G3 teaparty
gasp*
i wonder if pinkie can think inside a fireplace
and I have nothing against Luna. But dawn if this fandom doesn't all want to be her god damn White Knight.
SpadeMagnes[R]: THey just explained it right there.
Sumica: Blue moon my ASS
The fandom likes them way too much.
Dark92Enigma short movies compared to the LOTR and that Indian robot movie
mud ponies
This episode raises questions for me... It seems when Equestria was founded, Alicorns weren't around... So where did they come from and how did they become the leaders? (Other than the fact that they are obviously powerful enough to get whatever they want).
*damn
HATRED
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/16674
twilight_sprinkle: I hope we find out
I'm pretty sure celestia is older than that
Luna and Trixie. Kneejerk against the fandom's use of them.
00,10your ass is a full moon otakon?
Actually, the fandom's rather split on trixie
AlienWarhead: Tommorrow, I will not MISS IT
Pale_Horse: It's a cartoon?:S
Pale_Horse: a fourth rare tribe that only exists in very small numbers
They have their place, I like them, but the fandom...
for instance, I know meanwhile hates her so much that I now ship him with her
WHAT
so like our world, basically
otakon: Seaponies?
Sumica: If his pants are down it is
Sumica: no but the moon is not blue
she is over 3000 yrs old
Guess I should remember my MST3K mantra. :P
Ah see ponies!
I don't like the people who read too much into Trixie than she is.
It sounds like they had a mutually beneficial alliance.
<.<
twilight_sprinkle, she can think inside a chiminy
So what was this original land they came from?
and poor applejack has less fans than background ponies
this get's me... fan fic has ponies fearing what spike might become... nopony ever says anything about him narrating a play.
Pale_Horse, simple answer:Genetics
otakon: this is just a legend
Pale_Horse maybe they live elsewhere and came after Equestria was made
The Moon is Blue? Isn't that banned in Boston? :S
I wonder if it's sstill frozen
05,15Like how she MUST have a reason to be the way she is and deep down she's a good pony?
Brad__: but will it blend?..er i mean but what about a fireplace
00,10that was why I said "blue" moon otakon
Famine is cannon
She's arrogant and stupid and deluded. No she does not have any redeeming qualities. No she is not pathetic. No she is not a Woobie.
Sumica: well it's sure as hell not blue
windigos
Fuck I'm sick of seeing that.
0,14inb4 S3 gives her a redemption episode
Magic having only b een invented 2 weeks earlier...
0,14and I will drink all the salty tears
I want to see a fic where Trixie is a delusional jackass.
0,14and laugh at all the butthurt
DragonBorn!
otakon: because we all know that granny smith's family founded ponyville
Everypony is starving: wear a pudding hat
xD
what's the production value of this play?
invent cannibalism
Hell, I'm going to write that.
Each time I look up at the moon
Oh Pinkie :).
if that happens...then again, I don't wanna know
PUDDINGHEAD IS BEST PONY!
the earth pony queen is a bitch
and then
thats my dashie
I see the Mare in the moon
so when she puts the crown on wrong here... was that a staged thing.. or did she somehow screw up the play?
RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
Applechip magic
otakon: shes a bitch
Rabble rablle rablle rabble
And then there's the folks who not only gush over Luna, but then complain that she doesn't get enough screen time. Except that, outside of SPike and the CMC SHE'S THE ONLY NON-MAIN CHARACTER TO HAVE HER OWN EPISODE.
twilight_sprinkle: HOW DARE YOU!
My co-author wants me to write stereotypical Trixie crap? Fuck that, she's now irredeemable.
Rookeealding: I think screw up

In a CIVILIZED WAY.

AlienWarhead: OFCOURSE!
Flootahshy: well she is, look at how she treats the pony applejack plays
05,15I feel bad for saying this, but I love when the show destroys fanon
RAWRity: true but we've only seen her a grand total of 3 times
like people bitching about Luna not being in the Finale. WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE ADDED?
Reikim i was asked by you to remind you that trixie is best pony
oh yeah
The Tiara is worn backwards
Reikim there i reminded you
I love the way Princess Platinum wears that crown.
RAWRity: kicking changling ass maybe?

Pinkie's best line in this episode

twilight_sprinkle: but but but Pinkie Pie!
05,15also, I remember people bitched a lot about Luna in her episode....whatever happened to that?
fluttercry like every other fandom with their show?
TheRandomkid321: IKR'
otakon: and one of those 3 times was an ENTIRE EPISODE DEDICATED TO HER. Despite NOT BEING A GOD DAMN MAIN CHARACTER.
Flootahshy: shes not pinkie tho
This episode
I forgot how great this ep is.
twilight_sprinkle: but but but... but...
CrimsonPhoenix: Which one?
Sir?
so do you think spike is sticking to the script or ablibing some of his lines?
RAWRity: she's still a major character
Shuddup.
She seems more of a 'Sesnirp' to me
Reikim may i ask what's what your co-author want you to do ?
it'll come up in time
yes, Rookeealding
otakon: no. she isn't.
R34 COMMUNITY WAS RIGHT!
Flootahshy: so many butts
CrimsonPhoenix: Fair enough.
Yes SIR Rainbow Dash SIR!
so Pegasi are naturally bloodthristy?
otakon: she's a secondary character at BEST.
Fluttershy looks so cute in her armor!!
is rainbow dash's character a guy?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I've gone through this before. I ranted for maybe half an hour. I felt better afterwards.
Twilight as Rather Dashing. :D
sure, Elit3xPon3
Elit3xPon3: Tomboy.......
ker-splash
Nope
Here it comes
RAWRity: she RAISES THE FUCKING MOON she helps run goddamn Equestria for cribs sake
SANTA PINKIE CLAUS
Dark92Enigma: he means in the play
Elit3xPon3: It's never stated
Celestia plays more of an important role than her, and yet I don't see people clamoring to see an episode about Celestia, unless it involves Luna somehow.
Smart Cookie is great
The door is covered in snow
cowvarkian: Oh, yeah.
now ignite the fire

Oh my gosh

I LOVE THAT FACE

Luna and Celestia WORK because they DON'T take spotlight.

I am just about to be BRILLIANT
Applejack could think in the chimney, but...it'd be ill advised.
Cutie Pie face!
DAT FACE nneded a SQUEE
I LOVE THAT LINE AND THAT FACE!
break that fourth wall AJ
needed*
I think it's becasue they see Luna as the atoner
dat face lol
Best Pinkie line
Also: Applejack is WONDERFULLY snarky in this ep. I want to see more of this from her.
otakon: I'm talking about in the show itself. In the show, she's not importatn. She's a side character. The important characters are the Main Six anc occasionally the CMC
See you guys tommarow.
Except for your hat, of course
Reikim: same.
dat ponymas
Who eleted her?
Grow food with what? they dont have anything to grow

Love AJ's sarcasm in this episode

Dken2021: they see Luna as a woobie for them to try and "Save" or "fix"
Rex_Mundi: it was a revolution
Element of Honesty: License to Snark.
Pansy Hump!
Shame the unicorns didn't try to transmute food. Or make a cold resistant crop. That's what you get for taking things for granted.
and yet the CMC have had like 4 eps
:D :(

War is canon
Rex_Mundi: That's a very good question
because good god damn do some in the fandom LOVE them a woobie to cry over.
TONIGHT, WE'LL DINE IN HELL
Nyst: But then there wouldn't be a modern equestria, and the show wouldn't exist.
D'aaaaaaaawww
Stop whining
RAWRity: are you getting angry over people wanting to see some more Luna?
Bye NocturnalBlade
I prefer seeing Luna as a strong character.
Rarity's voice <3
5 MINUTES!???????
don't these guys know that granny smith
RAWRity huh, better word for it I suppose
She's a freaking goddess, for Celestia's sake.
lol 5 mins
twilight_sprinkle: Tabitha St. Germain, GREAT voice actress
One can assume that the Pegasi actually did fight a variety of threats on their way to the new land.
Oh god damn it
Whine whine whine goes Rarity...
Oh Rarity <3
s family found ponyville
Do something.....or CUT
XD
otakon: i could listen to her whining all day

otakon: because they ARE important. They're meant as younger foils to the Mane 6, as well as a focus for the whole growing pains type of lessons that wouldn't fit with the Mane 6
hmmm *scrolls up to get context on this argument*
nothing sexual here
o////O
*was
RArity <3.
This world must be like the G1 ponyverse, with random monsters and threats everywhere
Earth ponies would know how to avoid threats. Unicorns could defend themselves.
lol
It's not really an argument.
Ghosties: Are you behind?
Ghosties: so the Unicorns are snooty, the Pegasi are bloodthristy and the Earth Ponies are serfs...
what a biatch
Rarity *ahem* mounted Twilight
I also dislike how people act like Luna would make a better ruler than Celestia, or make Celestia out to be a tyrant.
Slavery, Race Superiority and Racism in an MLP FIM
It's more like all of us generally agreeing that the fandom can be stupid.
Tovler basicly rant about people liking luna and trixie and pretty much everything else

ikr
Yer Chancellorness...
gotta love Rarity! <3 ;)
"How would we survive if I just randomly shut up?"
RAWRity: Lunaverse. I refuse to even touch it.

lol
Pinkie Slobber.
PillowPoni and AlienWarhead sorry, miscommunication XD
LAWL
^
Reikim you din't even know about that until i told you it existed
Despite that whenever there's a large scale problem, Celestia shows up to try and fix shit, or gets twilight and the EoH on it.
spitball
it's what's to be expected
I guess pinkie spits.
otakon: I love Pinkie in every episode <3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: And as soon as I heard about it I refused to touch it.
Dark92Enigma: All those things were already covered in Bridle Gossip and A Dog and Pony Show
the hell is Lunaverse?
ok NocturnalBlade
Reikim because ?
Hey everyone!
thats paradise how?
and the Fluttershy built it
New York
How come only spike has the old timey accent?
Chaos emeralds?
hi Benickerson
<.<
Flutterdhy can see the future?
Holy crap
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I disagree with it on several fundamental points.
Pegasopolis?
Midnight_Fyre: EEEEYUP. But in a whole EPISODE?
Just
Russia
Hello Benickerson
Conceptually
This is possibly one of the rare if not the only good Merriwhether episode
Can you do that?
Dat Rarity :3
haha, the dazzling has been doubled!
It gives me indigestion.
Good point
He thought it would help his chracter?
Can you be dazzled twice?
DIRT!
Midnight_Fyre: Yeah, but now it's out beloved Ponies who've fallen victim to this behaviour.
otakon fic stuff in wich luna is powerful and banish celestia and there is other mane sic and so on
04I'll call it
04Earth
Dirtville!
Bob
^
we will call it.... this land
Must be from Sips Co.
OH THE ANVIL OF IRONY!!!!!!!!!!!
Ghosties: bob
THIS IS WHY I WON'T TOUCH IT
earth all along
<.<
pegasopolis, unicornia, earth
earth
Princess Platinum's theme is best music in this episode, and some of the best in the series
Huh
Reikim well k you don't like it point taken why you should bash on it ?
CALL IT BOB!
OH EARTH..... CALL THEH..EARTH
Dirtville is best ville
See? Earth ponies DO have powers. That was some wild-fast plant growing.
I'm not bashing it
After watching Gravity Falls' Pacifica Northwest, I don't want to see Trixie. The proud yet worthless bitch character gets old after a while.
I'm bashing the fandom.
don't get me started on the whole New Lunar Republic crap.
Quick_Thinker is quick: :$ Beat me to it! :)
Anger!
OH, EARTH........I CALL THEE EARTH
Youtube commentators in a nutshell
This Land!
Pale_Horse: it's a kind of natural magic
ALL THE NAMES ARE DUMB
NLR started out of a vaguely catchy song.
SHAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
got to try that on a board once.. Eariler than first
Reikim well deal with it cause you will find that in every fandom
"And we shall call it, 'This Land.'"
Planted her flag first? So Pinkie arrived before she actually arrived!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ah
The level 85 dungeon
SpadeMagnes[R]: ALL, the names?
SpadeMagnes[R]: True, so true.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: k. No hard feelings, I hope.
earth ponies travel across the earth to come upon earth. YO DAWG.
9000 YEARS DUNGEON
So my dad found out I was going to Canterlot Gardens. His reaction was just like. Nothing at all
i vote for HELL
05,15Yeah....a lot of the fandom I stay away from. Most of it actually
so does clover predate starswerl?
Reikim just enjoy the things you like and leave the others enjoy what they want
i vote for calm
IT IS ON
Prepare the megaspells
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Sorry, I'm just...I've been having issues with my co-author.
I mean I would like to see more characterization of Celestia and Luna tbh
I've always thought Earth ponies would make good Druids and Geomancers.
but it'll probably never happen
IT'S THE WINDIGOS
Aaaaaaand NOW it's russia
Assuming the tale is a simplification, we can extrapolate that they explored in all directions, but found no fertile land anywhere else but one spot.
dem Windagos
dun dun duuunnn
So where the fuck did the Windigos go anyway?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Nothing personal, sorry. On another day, another time, I might read it. But there are other things keeping me from doing so.
Avoid the pink cloud! :O
GET ON WITH!
And then Tirak attacked
/me GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
GET ONE WITH IT!
GET ON WITH IT
MOVE ON
SpadeMagnes[R]: it's all just a legend
ablibing much spike?
Reikim i know you told me your co-aouthor want you to do stuff you don't agree then told him so and stop whinning about it
SpadeMagnes[R]: the mountains
we get it move on!
SpadeMagnes[R]: the twilight character killed them with flame
YES GETON WITH IT!!!!!!!
Pale_Horse maybe warriors because they are strong workers
YES GET ON WITH IT
Dovashy cast master level blizzard spell
Also it bothers me that everyone has to be happy and friendly or else shit like this happens
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: No, it's just...agh, I can't understand.
Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet OOOOOOOOOOOOOON WITH OIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Reikim btw i'm not forcing you to read it
Or explain.
dat voice
*Cheers and Yells*
they didnt search medium
ah free will
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know, and for that, I thank you.
lol
I can't
SpadeMagnes[R]: well not really but being openly hostile to everyone will do it
SEARCH MEDIUM HEIGHT
0,14so much kvetching
Argh
My head is SO fucked up right now.
Mozdoc: But it emphasizes the moral of friendship.
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's more like everyone has to get along.
Reikim take a break and stop thinking about it
Here I am! Rock you like a Rainbow Dash!
or else
Not to mention a simple argument of two foals can set a god of chaos free <.<
Mozdoc At least war doesn't work there
Reikim now watch ponies
TOM'S GRANDDAD!
why does a captain bring a private for a mission like this? I would bring a general or sargent
REGINALD
Sorry, TheGreatAndPowerfulT. I really went past the line of courteousy there. I try to avoid getting like that as much as possible. Sorry again, it's not supposed to happen.
A ROCK? THAT'S MY DESTINY!?
you like rocks dont you rarity?
oh tom
Quick_Thinker: Commander
thios is before discord
TOM
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Apology cookie?
whatever
Don't go around baROCK Obama
OHAI TOM
00,10you know I think pinkie is just trolling
SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, +1 foal and you have the Ssn 2 premiere...
spitfirecolt: yeah he came later
losers woopers
Sumica: I love Pinkie in this ep
SpadeMagnes[R] to be fair Discord should have locked in a vault or tossed into the ocean
finders keepers losers weepers~
a rock
Reikim no need to apology because that was an statment not meant to anyone directly
a roick
No, really
So the time line for this show... this episode is before the princesses and Discord?
DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING
pinkie the troll, i like that
or both, AlienWarhead
a rock
Pinkie proves that boundaries are insignificant.
I was a bloody hypocrite
yep
Yea... having the god of chaos available for ALL to see was a stupid idea
It would actually be better if Rarity hadn't mentioned jewels in the rock. It would really emphasize that they are just fighting over a simple rock
they'll fight for tom
CRY some Moar!! :[
I bitch about the way the fandom can get retarded and then I mirror them.
this is DEFINITELY Russia. All we need now is mass insurance fraud.
THIS IS ARGUING!!!!!!!!!!!
Well Excuuuuuuuse ME Princess... :|
Use Ice Heal!
hehe like everyone at times
WE WERE FROZEN TODAY
ikr Pale_Horse
SpadeMagnes[R]: It makes me wonder how many gods of chaos there ARE in this world
Apologies to everyone here.
annnd they froze
well shit
Did anyone bring ice heals?
Pinkie Scrunchy face
lol
Unrelated: complete d'awwww moment coming up.
*fireball*
eeyup
Ponies will be ponies
so does clover predate starswerl?
Interesting. The unicorns wanted the mineral wealth. Like the caves under Canterlot. The earth ponies played a game of provocation. And it was the pegasi (not unexpectedly) that took the first agressive steps.
it happens to the best of us sometimes
Well excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me princess
Windigoes
So in the play... did they just stand still for the rest of the play?
What kill the dinoponies THE ICE AGE
this is one heck of a play!
WINDIGOS
05,15I WAS FROZEN TODAY
windigos would live it in our world
Use Flame Wheel to thaw out of the ice
*love it
kingdom hearts logo
incoming
So yea the moral is be friends and nice OR ELSE
incoming LITERAL Crowning Moment of Heartwarming
Fluttershy can fly..... Just saying
00,03And then they all froze to death
TovlerTheClever: :D
on a lighter note, have this image in your brain now: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/557308_10151268444185802_54695396_n.jpg
I CHOOOSE YOUR CHARAZARD USE FLAME THROWER
WE NEED HUGS TO SAVE EQUESTRIA
Rookeealding: They probably wore an ice mask
Scoot-Scootaloo: The End
Fluttershy's scared of flying, remember?
D'aaaaaaaaaawww
also i accomplished my cuota of talk here for the time being- Back to lurking
Twilight gets some of the sappiest lines
Fluttershy is best hater.
All da wub <3
ironic, fluttershy is the only one who expresses severe dislike
Where I come from Windigos are called lake effect snow :)
stop hating each other or die!
SpadeMagnes[R]: no the moral is to it's easier to get along by working TOGETHER than forcing others to do stuff
Pffft
the music makes me sad
/me snerks
RAWRity not sure if i love you or i hate you
i love you girls as we die
SpadeMagnes[R]: Almost like it's a progressive value that all the nations of the earth need to bond together to solve humanity's problems...
THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
I KNOW NOW KINGDOM HEARTS...IS FRIENDSHIP!
WE WERE UNFROZEN TODAY
KINGDOM HEARTS!!!
that takes some damn guts to say
maybe both
Remember when Charizard was frozen? It was why he began to obey Ash.
so yeah, friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are better
Why didn't FLuttershy Fly to avoid the Ice
Magic flamethrower... OF LOVE!
As Charlie Chaplain said "You do not hate, only the unloved and the unnatural hate"
TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER
KINGDOM HEARTS YEAH
lol
Remember kids: Friendship is Magic.
Literally.
this one too while we're at it http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/378200_10151268049575802_1352910361_n.jpg
;d
That has to be THE SAPPIEST thing I ever heard
dat was cheesy
*:d
00,10and no one called deus ex machenia that time
screw the other guys
Unicorns are OP. Nerf Now Plz... :(
XylemTube: bc the air around them was freezing
KINGDOM HEARTS
tSparx yay that will happen when we are willing to become economically equal with the world I dont think most of us could accept that
And then heartless decended on the land
oh, yeah, deus ex machina
k i love you :p
we're together DRAWN TOGETHER /title drop
moral of the story; don't hate, or windigos will fuck you up
And then they all died
SpadeMagnes[R]: But it's useful, right?
Pale_Horse: THIS IS NOT ME3 NO NERFING
so in other words AJ Fluttershy and Twi are the most loving
flamethrower=friendship
You magnificent bastard, RAWRity
the fire of friendship lives in our hearts!
Nobody toes the line like you.
Sumica ponies do Deus ex machina better
of all the ponies
Deus-Heart-Machina
RAWRity as usual , your picture sharing is funny
Goodness, every single time Twilight's eyes glow pure white... Yeesh, that is creepy :S
and yes,pyro=friendship
: D
05,15and once again, RD was proven to be the worst pony
yay
05,15the end
So when the fuck did Celestia,Luna and Discord show up?
except on the internet. Internet's hate laughs at the windigos
and now awesome song
song time
AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE!
SONG TIME
SONG
00,10when they made the flag SpadeMagnes[R]
fluttercry: RD is best pony
I remember the first time I saw this ep.
YAY
/me Sings along
must've been hard to do a proper Spike voice and not sound like the Mayor
Malk: I'm not gonna get all up in Poli-Sci International Relations, I'm just sayin' that Lauren Faust isn't exactly a Tea-Partier (not that there's anything wrong with that)
And that's how i got my cutie mark
and btw fluttershy is worst pony.
<3 this song
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo
oh really?
The fire of Sandwidth
Had a long argument with a friend about what this does to the timeline.
D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaw <3
national athem according to the wiki
This isn't a bad song but...it never stuck in my head like all the other songs.
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's a kid show.:D
Wait so how do celestia and luna become rulers tSparx?
RAWRity: O_O
dawwwww
pony is worst pony that ponies pony while ponying ponies
I saw like 4 doctor whooves
/me applauds
ANd that's how I got my Cutie Mark! :O
national athem according to the wiki
This song is too damn short
i wish that song were longer
Nyst not long enough
Ever episode I watch makes Ponyville less and less a fun place to live
Malk: THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP, DUH!
Derpy...
04My god, that big buck toothed pony back there
http://www.derpibooru.org/2704?scope=scpee8fe1a7fc9e77787699d06771b464b2a3cdd77cb
anybody else crying right now?
true, this definitely fucked up a good deal of Equestria Founding fics
Reikim: well doesn't explain the RPS so no idea tbh
This is my SECOND favorite song of the series.
otakon: RPS?
FIGHT
Jigglysaint: Nope
So...wait, the window was open ALL this time?
/me ZUUUUUUUUUUUUL MOTHERFUCKER, ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
blah
Royal Pony Sisters
Well, what we have to see here is
royal pony sisters
Ghosties: I think those were goofy teeth, I think they were fooling around.
Celestia and Luna
tSparx so the mass murder of half of all the ponies didnt have anything to do with it?
teeheehee
THank you!
Hi everypony!
KINGDOM HEARTS!
lol
hoi CrazyHippie
What Windegos are somewhat based on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo
CrazyHippie: Hello!
ZUUL DOGS! ALWAYS WORKS
04Alright, I'm out everyone. Have a good night, hope you enjoyed the show!!
Malk: What makes you think they mass murdered half the pony pop? What!?
wait, so.... mindfuck ending?
ha ha ha evil ice spirits that feed off hate
i just noticed fluttershy was aruging.. usually shes quiet
Let's say we assume that the basics of this story are true.
Night Ghosties
bye ghosties
HUgs to twilight_sprinkle and AJIsAwesome
well that was fun
cya Ghosties !
bye Ghosties
nite Ghosties
bye Ghosties
night Ghosties
Hmmm, I wonder how long that heart's been there.
so what next
Bye
bye
Ghosties: Bye!
See you Ghosties
So would that make the windigoes invinceble by feeding off trolls?
moar
so they ate all their people?
yep
tSparx by their references of this big war they never explain
damnit done
First thing it does to the timeline: Equestria was founded during some sort of period where the Princesses aren't present.
the biggest thing it establishes is that Equestria wasn't founded by Celestia and Luna
Later Gho....
^ Exactly.
Malk: That's not in the show! That's in like a fan video xD
/me moves like jagger
Ghosties, out of curiosiry.....what happened to Hipster_Brony?
YOURE BANNED
Well, that was a nice movie night, I guess.
thanks for the movies Sumica!
I'd like to apologize for my attitude regarding the B-Movie.
ETF IS THIS
Oh this! :D
what the
LOLOLOL
Malk: Unless we're talking about something I've missed out on...
Yes SFM Jagger
:D
And yet, they are on the flag, but that could be construed as an anachronism as a result of the retelling.
It was wrong of me to complain about the manner in which it's presented.
the rifftrax was funny :D
lolwut
YOURE BANNED!!!
If it isn't, then that means that they endured as a kind of myth for a while.
DUDE THIS TURNED ME OFF SO MUCH
like the nether one better
tSparx oh I thought that fan thing was part of the actual lore
Dat dance :P
This movie is banned.
Who got banned?
05,15and then everyone got banned
LOL
Kandarihu: Don't worry about it. Don't mention it and noone will remember
Now, this story may have taken place during one of two periods.
ikr fluttercry
which means there's at least a certain period of time where Equestria wasn't ruled by Alicorns. Opening up a lot of questions on how the government operated before the Duocracy we see now.
this is disturbing
ah, dictator leadership, discreatly hidden in a kid's show
Oh no I was banned!
I must depart, take care everypony!
Malk: Nah, nah :P It's this parody of the Sisterhoove's ep, but it's not lore-based.
Post-Discord Pre-NM, or Post-NM and Pre-Mane6.
well from the looks of things Discord came first
bye
Bye Everlasting_Joy
oh this
Nuuuuuu! I'm banned! :'(
Kandarihu: you're forgiven.........but i need to watch it, so i could give it a proper judgement
then the RPS
Midnight_Fyre, well, I cut myself off from the episode that I personally selected,.
then NmM
Well of course Discord came first.
Derpeh
Malk: Er, not canon, rather. Not even really fanon :P
then just Tia
Goodnight Everlasting_Joy
DERPY
Dang... I NEED to find my PS3 headset (it works on my Mac.) Now that I'm moved into my apartment, I gotta be careful with these late night Bronystate post shows! :$
Derpy!?
love this vid
Squee!
derp?
I just said the two timelines it could have happened in.
Soldier + derpy?
Derpy makes best Soldier companion
tSparx ok I so there wasnt a war?
Hi Derpy.
OK gotta go after this short
Derpy!!
also, COWBOY BEBOP MUSIC!
Hi everypony
i think i watched this
Squee
hi
well by Dark92Enigma ahead of time, sleep well
hey DerpyMuffins
Ouch
Malk: Not in the show, no
hi DerpyMuffins
rarity?
hiya Derpy_Hooves
Ow
jesus where are the derpy pings coming from?
lol
ow
i dont know what this is but I saw Derpy so its gotta be good
ahem hiya DerpyMuffins
If it's Post-Discord Pre-NM, then we can say some BS like the RPS were resting or something after their fight.
COWBOY BEBOP FTW
tSparx I would asume many of them died of starvation though
Or, another possibility: Celestia and Luna were actually inspired by the two ponies on the flag, or are in fact those symbols given life.
Hey DerpyMuffins
Malk: At least, not that they've ever mentioned
Poor Rarity
hmmm, not sure which mods are on
mean old heavy
Derpy_Hooves: DerpyMuffins
lol
RAWRity: They defeated Discord.
Wat teh fuk
Or
Dammit stop
Hah
lol what is this
well Sumica, Nittany, Ghosties
Malk: Yeah, but that doesn't have to do with Celestia & Luna coming to power :)
Lol
Well, I'm heading for bed. G'night everypony
We'll assume this isn't the case right now.
What de fu nk.
BRONIES ONLY
bye
nite Midnight_Fyre
bronies only
Wat de duck Heavy.
11,01Wut?
Ouch
Cya Midnight_
Deal with it!

fluttershy in swag glasses?
Is good
Bitch
hove punch!
YOUR FACE
Assume that Celestia and Luna actually existed way back when, okay?
dat Brohoof
Flutter SHY.
*hoove
Nittany_Discord: Phase4 was wondering what mods were on
your face is good
face is good yes
So
LOL
I dunno, there's no mention of Discord during the play, which would mean that Discord likely came along AFTER Equestria was founded.
Nittany_Discord, BerryPunch needs +v
Playing FIM before its out
Theeese good.
FLUTTER.......PUNCH
FIGHTING IS MAGIC FUCK YEA
Wut
fihgint is magic XD
Fighting is Magic?
xD
ja
tSparx well the lack of trust in their leaders that caused starvation would have helped them come to power because of the vacume of any good strong leadership
It's the Alpha, I'll bet
XD
11,01K. Done.
rainbow PUNCH
FIGHTING IS MAGIC FTW
RAWRity: probably
wow
Lol!!
So much ponys today...
pinkie lost shes pissed
thx ^_^
The problem is what happens if HWE takes place post-NM and pre-Mane6.
That BG Music! ,3
Where the hell was Tia?
Are they their pimps? ._.
*<3
11:36 and I'm tired as fuck
How did they even use controlers without fingers?
Malk: I don't think the princesses came to power until after the founding of Equestria
Why DON'T we have a psycho-twilight emoticon on here?
LOL
Rarities parents theame
Yeah
Pyro and Pinkie are friends
SpadeMagnes[R]: Powerpuff
:)
I guess that's what you get from working day time
INSIDE THE CHIMNEY
SpadeMagnes[R] Magic
We might say that she withdrew from the world due to sadness, but then, it's said in the first episode that she took over sun/moon duty after banishing Luna.
IT'S A TRAP
Fire!
HADOKEN
tSparx no but it did lead up to it
Hadoken
this is why pinkie always wins
dun dun dunnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Shet
05,15faak you
SpadeMagnes[R]: Powerpuff's Law: You Don't Need Fingers, let alone thumbs, To Operate Machines
this is so funny
LOL.
Reikim: I doubt it. Seeing as the Unicorns were raising the sun and the moon, and it's at least implied that Celestia did both Post-NMM, it's say it's at least pre-nmm
Piny Hooves are magical
PINKIE SWORE
I'm Badass solider.
So for this reason I propose that the HWE tale takes place post-Discord pre-NMM.
Pinkie's fakk you is so cute
Bonk
Pony hooves are magical
STAREDOWN
Pinkie you swore.
where is that from?
RAWRity: Exactly.
LOL
Reikim: not likely
Boring

You dare throw dat me.
yeah going to bed now
otakon: Do you not see the logic here because I do.
lol
Dat Earthbound music.
talk to ya'll latah
Personally, I go with the theory that it takes place before Discord
I brought you a letter!
They sure do like playing favorites
Baldumborat.
What is this video called?
Porn?
i found a OC of a pony in COD Black ops im pleasently surprised
Reikim: well explain how Discord came BEFORE the Windigoes
Goodnight CrimsonPhoenix

HOO BOY

What's this video.........TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!
OMG SCOUT LOL RAINBOW DASH
otakon: ...Why?
05,15wut
Is theese?
o_o
Lol
lol...
0_)
Why do I have to prove that?
bc that's what you're saying
Uh, yeah.
What video called?
So it's almost midnight BronyState time, ja?
lol Rainbow Dash wut.
TELL ME THE NAME OF THE VIDEO?
ROFl you call that fapping!
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
A gun.
Is there a problem with that?
And Applejack did nothing.
SMIPNY RULES
yay medic
Guitars.
no
oh boy
Precisely.
NOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Even Medic got something.
So there's no need for me to prove it.
perhaps, and this is just me talking out of my ass, Discord took over, and some powerful unicorn gave life to the two ponies on the flag, to combat him with the Elements of Harmony.
._.
NOO.
awwwwwwwwwww
AAAAAH
O.O
o-o
/me orders pizza expects it here in 30 minutes its Spinage
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Eep
but I would like to here an explanation how Discord came before the Windigoes
LOL
But..But...SCOOTALOO!
psychoshy
my planet needs me
WHOA FLUTTERSHY
I would think the ponies would not like being under the rule of the Spirit of Chaos
05,15HA HE SAID IT
EPIC
The earth is round?
Haha
lol.
dat Hetaliua
RAWRity: I had a headcanon like that once. I thought: "Hey, what if alicorns existed pre-Discord, but then he trashed them, then they took the Elements of Harmony (which exist inside all ponies) and refined them into weapons?"
hehehe
Haha
HETALAI!
and they probably wouldn't have been bothered by the Windigoes
fluttercry: I WAS FROZEN TODAY! it never gets old
LOL THEY GOT STUCK
"And then the Elements turned Tia and Luna into goddesses to preserve harmony?"
GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
We should watch Hetalia.
lol
GET ON WITH IT!!!
Dat monthy Python

well actually that's a decent headcanon
dat YTOAS
dat abridged
Yeah

I thought of writing it.

RADA RADA RADA tSparx
GET ON WITH IT
YTAS*
SAY WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
lol
dat grinch
Really?
Oh geeze, Grinch xD
Though then we'd also have to take into account the accuracy of Pony history, and how long ponies can live. As Starswirl the Bearded is mentioned as having lived during the time that Equestria is founded, and Luna's mentioning of him implies she either knew him, or was familiar enough with him from texts to know about the placement of the bells on his clothes.
also, since C and L VANQUISHED him
SAY WHAAAAAAA
otakon: We're only a couple generations from forgetting about Hitler.
lol
SAY WHAAA.
i know heard this somewhere
OK gotta go
SAW WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
but what
You are empirically wrong, Twilight. Nothing is stronger than Chuck Norris... :|
C and L vanquished him
RAWRity: That's true.
That reminds me. There was this one product on TV I saw, and it was Chuck Norris approved.
Dan VS!!
Fuck yeah Fluffymixer
Dat fluffy pony
ah yeah welcome
FWUFFY! :)
bye everypony
I wish he would post more
before L went rogue
Flufflepuff
DAN VS!
05,15We need to watch Dan Vs again
I love Dan Vs.
bye sark92
It's so funny.
ZUUL
It's got a new season too right?
*dark92
yes, Dan Vs is a really good show
ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL
and they showed up after Equestria got founded
Season 3.
so I think
Then again, seeing as Twilight herself knew about the bells, it's possible Pony History is accurate going way back, and Luna just has an interest in history.
FluffyPony is so Adorable!!
dafuq
Is that the real voice of Dan?
THIS IS NOT 12
What is this?
Rainbow Cupcake.
FOURTEEN
lol
Yes, that's his real voice.
Hmm, was the voice of Dan taken from an episode?
jump out the window?
He's looking for a VA for Dan
good plan
Vordox I think so
Troll
Equestria, Discord shows up, RPS show up, NmM shows up, modern day.
What's the puffball pony?
Possible, but I think it's more likely that Luna knew about Starswirled.
...
ive seen enough henti
troll
Bye.........ZUUUUUL MOTHERFUCKER ZUUUUUUL...........Save the tip for the maid..............bye
:D
hehehe
LOL
XD
YES
Oh yeah, Beach Boys
oh fuck
Trollight Sparkle
Wait
lol.
Mozdoc: Flufflepuff
hey, I like this song
LOL.
LOL
:$ She's a genius!
of course, it could be that that episode was just a fun little aesop fable about friendship, and I'm thinking way too hard about this shit.
BA BA BA BA
However, RAWRity, on the other hand it's possible that the RPS showed up just after Equestria's founding, before Starswirled died.
dat Barbera Ann
and i no havve an epileptic sezuire YAY
Dammit this isn't Beach Boys :|
brb, gonna get a cupcake
And we enjoy thinking too hard about this, it's part of being a nerd.
that's also a possibility
or two
Reikim: true
Unfortunately, the VA for Dan is on that new show for Nickolodeon, Robot and Monster.:|
05,15well I'm gonna go now. later everyone!
Reikim: yes it's wonderful isn't it?
Whoa. This music. What is it?
Bye fluttercry
Bye fluttercry! :D
05,15Later Regulars
fluttercry: Bye!
No I mean the Tumbler is looking for one
forgot how aweosme this song is
night fluttercry sleep well
Anyway, I see the Timeline like this. Because headcanon.
seeya fluttercry
fluttercry: Night man.
bai fluttercry
Even if it's stupid just remember, Robot Monster is better than Fanboy and ChumChum.
be back later guys
AJIsAwesome did the VA say he couldn't do Dan vs.
Well everypony its been great, but i gtg see ya :)
bye
I'm not dissing it, I'm just thinking it's funny we're spending more time thinking about this than the writers ever did. Because I know damn well they never sat down and tried to set up a timeline for the history of equestria like Tolkein or something.
Hello bronystate!
So what was the first movie and first pony ep? I missed both.
Hey HoodyNinja
I'm out Everypony!
AlienWarhead: I'm not sure. I do know he's voicing one of the characters i the show.
How are you fine gents this evening
hello HoodyNinja
RAWRity: The irony is what makes it fun.
hai HoodyNinja
Oh hey HoodyNinja
And Im back. With chilli! :D
Gotta love this fandom, sometimes.
Anyway
Wb
im going to guess double dragon theme
anyway
wayany
why... hell if i know
Thanks thelonepony. :D
ayaywn
part of a beinga fan, we think more than the producers themselves, and go way extreme with tons of theories
You missed all of it.
go sumica pony
definitely not dd
Great Alicorn Empire > Discord > Celestia and Luna > Celestia and Luna withdraw from the world due to some BS like a policy of non-interference > Equestria founded > C and L re-enter out of curiosity or some BS > Luna gets jealous, NMM born > Celestia rules for a thousand years > Mane6.
yeah
this is pretty obscure
What PMV is this?
Green pony is rocking.
Sumica: Is this Apples.Life or someting?
Reikim: doable actually
oh boy
Behold my headcanon.
WHAT
lol
DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE
lol I remember this
...Wow.
DAT FLOPPY
I love the pop ups
damn
XD
Look upon my headcanon, ye fanboys, and despair.
FLOPPY DISK
So MUCH FLOPPIS
I'm beholding it
Those are Floppy Drives, right?
Wait...the floppy disks are the colors of the ponies whose phrases are on them.
and honestly it could work
Mozdoc: Quality
I like the customized one.
BRAVO BRAVO that probely took over 4 weeks to get sup
FLOPPY.PIE is cutest floppy drive! :O
So is harddrive music a new meme or something?
the hook to this son sounds good even when played through undulating hard drives
Mozdoc, I see.
new music
HOW
Possible contingent theory: Celestia partially planned for the Mane6.
Who did this I love them
FLOPPY drive, not hard drive
I remember floppy discs that were actually floppy
I wonder, what if -and bare with me- what if all the generations are all connected someway?
richfiles: <.< Are you not seeing the FLoppy Discs?
GENIUS!
rightright, -5 nerd points
Perhaps she had the option of neutralizing NMM completely and held back because LOVE.
Meh, I personally go >Equestria founded >Discord >RPS show up >Discord Beaten >RPS Rule >NMM happens >Celestia rules for 1000 year >Mane 6
It runs Doom II at max settings!
Marx I think only one guy does it I'm not sure
Works too.
and yes they are called FLOPPy drives not hard drives, its just a term that wont die out
Wow
Marx It's actually an old meme, they did this even back when floppies were new. Just didn't get around much because, y'know, no internet
inb4 Tirek returns
Was replying to Marx, who called them hard drives
Anyway
i wonder how this is programmed
ANYWAY
Okay then
Just when I was getting tired of this song, FLOPPY DRIVE MIX
Thats happening
RAWRity: that's what I was thinking
00,10just a midi controler
I wonder how much Celestia planned for the Mane6.
I suddnly want to play Lake Odell and Oregon Trail all over again. :P
Dken2021: O_o
RAWRity exactly
Reikim: a lot maybe
There's software you can download to do this yourself. It's an easy to pick up hobby.
richfiles. Oh yeah, that makes more sense.
have fun on the oregon trail
I remember floppy disks and diskettes
Also I'm not going to bare with you, that's just weird.
I notice that one is colored pink with Pinkie Pie's cutie mark.
Um hello, everpony
I want a Pinkie Pie floppy drive
/me googles what a midi controlelr is
i miss floppy disks
Hello F1uttershy
it is, and seems like a lot of thinking anyway
tSparx shall we start a debate decussing time history politics philosphy and ponies?
F1uttershy: Howdy!
So let's say that Celestia had the option of taking out NMM for good and held back.
i see no one got it
I know she at least planned for Twilight to make friends to beat NMM. The question is whether she did this because she didn't have the power to beat NMM herself, or knew that Twilight doing it would turn NMM back to Luna rather than just imprisoning her.
Why? She loves her sister.
And
i paintd and skinned my labtop to havve Twilight Sparkle cover and all kinds of other shit on it
thats great really
discussing tSparx
I miss when floppy disks were actually floppy
Awesome.
Perhaps the whole bit about Nightmare Moon was a gambit to salvage her sister.
Don't knock floppy disks. They're more powerful than people think. They once stored Optimus Prime's personality on one. :D
YES
AHM BLUE
YES
that was awesome
YES
Yay
:( I used diskettes in 2005 even though everyone else was using USB.
You have to wonder why, exactly, she ended up disconnected from the Elements.
DA BA DEE DA BA DAI
dabuu dee
Im a beat of
RAWRity: I think Celestia COULDN'T use the Elements at full power and using them as they did kind of de-powered them
This was SUPER easy to do on Commodore 1541 Floppy drives. Due to how simple the computers were back then, the Floppy Drive actually had it's own dedicated CPU, RAM, and ROM, in essence, it was a stand alone computer, and you could certainly hack it to play music! :)
OMG what pmv or whatever is this?
Now we have SD cards with 32 gigs
that's why she was only able to banish her
BLUE
Malk: LORD no. I'm a still a little buzzed, very content to sit here, listen to tunes, finish reading my novel.
um pony_300 the reason they arent floppy anymore is becuase its legacy tech so its entirely useless
I think
This is Blue by Eiffel 65
shouldn't rainbow be in the blue pony video
LOL.
IM IN NEED OF A DIME
Perhaps it was the conflict between the two sisters - I believe it's said that Luna/Celestia used to be co-wielders?
I bought a USB floppy drive for one of my older laptops that didn't have floppy installed on it because I figured there'd be a situation where one would be needed.
Well, more like a ponified remix of Blue
:( um i like it very much
yeah
Pinkie isn't Blue... She's obviously pink! She's trying to confuse me... :|
You know, i didnt really like this PMV at the start ,but it grew on me :D
otakon: true. And I go with that. Otherwise I have to question Celestia's judgment in risking 1000 years of Darkness because she wanted her sister back.
tSparx mabye some other time for fun what you reading?
Either that or Celestia intenionally DC'd herself.
they did use the EoH to imprison Discord
Well, Celestia was at least connected to the EoH during the 1000 years, even if she couldn't use their full power.
RAWRity: They were co-wielders, so it's possible that their infighting depowered the Elements somehow, or Celestia just couldn't use them at full power on her own.
I'm pretty sure Tia wasn't in harmony when she had to face her sister
Oh what is this song!
creepy shiz
Malk: Yarborough by B.H. Friedman. I'm 40 pages from the end and still don't know how to describe what it's about
ok this is kinda creepy
I know it from my childhood!
sounds creepy
Still no Dashie?
YES!
HoodyNinja[games]: scroll up meng, someone wrote it
00,10FlutterPie is blue
Since her being connected to them was what kept Discord imprisoned until after NMM returned
twilight_sprinkle: I remembered the song, nvm :)
Blue, by Eiffel 65
Oh yeah, I forgot that.
HoodyNinja[games]: I'm Blue
Neither of those ponies are blue... :(
This is yet another one of these 80s songs.
Yay i have glasses
im purple
hey what happebed did the stream froze?
Okay, i get it...
Late 90s\
Now, bear with me here, I'm trying to sort something out.
HoodyNinja[games]: (abadee abadye
the fact that Tia imprisoned her, rather than turning her back to normal, also implies that they weren't at their full power when she used the EoH
:D
OPEN GUNDAM STYLE
tSparx whats it about?
Hoo boy
AW SNAP!!
GANGNAM STYLE!
GUNDAM STYLE
YES
OH MY GOD YES GUNDAM STYLE
The validity of this is highly dependant on exactly how much influence you think the Elements have, so bear with me.
This song is from the mid/late 90's, isn't about?
This should be good.
Reikim is not only possible its cannon since the lack of rainbow dash + the discorded weilders in discord ep lead to the elements useless
wahtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
isn't it*?
YEAAAAA
GUNDAM STYPLE
lol gundamn style
:D
Of course
I should have know

Shit I'm distracted now.
/me puts the stream on a chopping block and brings down his axe
PONIES.
Anyway
Malk: "I'm 40 pages from being done and still don't know how to describe what it's about"
Sumica: where's Opony Gangam style?
The Mane6's origins are suspiciously coincidental.
/me must learn korean
i swear, every time this song is streamed, ill come up with gory ways to kill it
whoever saved this video, THANK YOU
Girldams and guydams.
Guncannon?
tSparx what type of book?
And very convenient.
HEY!
Malk: Novel
HEY!
well that's writing for you
Now, there are two forces who may have possibly done this.
BEAR WITH ME
Open GUNDAM STYLE
i so wanna do this dance
GUNDAM STYLE!
THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS A REALLY LONG PUN!! :D
tSparx thanks for very specific answers

The bass!
Um.....gang nam style
/me bears with Reikim, a grizzly to be exact.
Sumica: THANK YOU
/me RAWRs Reikim
HEY SEXY LADY
Celestia may have done it, but a gut instinct tells me she didn't. It's too chancy. I don't think she was able to predict all of that, goddess or no.
Sumica: THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
Like a boss.
Malk: I'm sorry, I don't know how to be more specific.
O God this video
dat ass
HEY SEXY LADY
ass
Malk: It's, very, idk.
There needs to be a Chitty version
Hey Sexy Lady.
oh, open gundam style
I want to ride a pony... Whatcha doin later Twi! :$ XD
I notice that all the girls have Zeon's Mobile Suits over their faces, while the guys all have Earth Federation Mobile Suits over their faces.
So
The other possibility is that the Elements arranged for it on their own.
dat ass.
RRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAWWWWWEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!!!
tSparx ok gotcha
Malk: It's abstract, it's deep, it openly defies easy categories.
that would make sense
0,14....YES.
interesting
This is really well done. Whoever made this paid a lot of attention to small detail.
/me ties up the stream and lowers it into a den of hungry spiders
I remember Chitty.
They need new wielders, right?
yeah
HEY!
Why is everyone calling me sexy? :(
HEY!
And they're supposedly the most powerful thing canonically.
tSparx like divine comedy?
LISTEN! :D
being a basic force in that reality I would say
hmm, Elements of Harmony being sentient to an extent? I like the idea.
Why wouldn't they be able to arrange the Mane6's existence?
Open GUNDAM STYLE

Semi-sentient.
Beyond our comprehension.
Who is streaming again?

This ties into my Great Alicorn Empire thing, but I won't get into that now.
oh God we've crossed over the fandom lines now
sumica id guess
eyyyyyyyy.
That mod spam. :P
Malk: More like Jitterbug Perfume (Tom Robins), or maybe kinda like As I Lay Dying (William Faulkner)
best part coming right now

this song couldnt get any monotonous if it tried

We now return you to your usually scheduled randomness
yeah, we're just discussing possible theories and whatnot. And I actually like the idea that the Elements orchestrated it, in order to bring Luna back and return the world to harmony
CALL UPON THEM!
SOS!
NNUUUUUUUU
Thanks for the stream Sumica

unlike us they have other stuff to worry about :P
0,14thanks, Sumica
This is Ponies pre-Lauren Faust style.
Reikim: the elements may have known that NMM was going to return, and set the Mane 6 up to combat her eventually.
Thanks .
ba dum tss.
wo hoo
which gen is this?
Why do they need shoes? Silly seaponies, you have fins!
Either the Elements knew and cared about NMM's return, or Celestia conviniced them to hold back on getting themselves some new Bearers.
Gen 1
Yeah!
I see
is that applejack
first wirisme1989
mica
And
sumi

That was so messed up how that happened like that.
they have the abilities to seperate bubbles apparently
wirisme1989 G1 I think
Sumica: actually my bitching has a lot of variety
bye bye sumi!!
otakon plus it be less fun if they planned stuff without us putting any input on it
wirisme1989 1 and are you really 1989 years old?
O_O ive...what?
Perhaps they influenced Celestia as well? That's how Celestia knows to send Twilight to Ponyville.
Oh yes~
It's Bacon and Applejeck!
um.........lolwut?
lol
Gen1 AppleJack
I wonder if that is the actual size of Gen 4 ponies?
I'm going with "They knew NMM was going to return and wanted to bring Luna back, to re-establish the Duocracy
It's BACON AND APPLEJACK
yay woah
"
It was gweat

Princess Celestia has such a reputation for manipulating people. But really? She's being used by the Elements.
well not only that

The most importan question is: where does Molestia fits in this universe ?

Celestia knows that sending Twilight to Ponyville will fix everything.

About.... 1 hour till its sept here
*torched
Harmony holds the universe together.
but I think I found a way to solve at least one of my problems
Kawaii_icybeauti: Aw, everything'll alright desu!
Elit3xPon3 this calls for a song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfLEc09tTjI
00,03Wake me up, when September ends~
Thus why Friendship IS Magic.
nighty tSparx
Kawaii_icybeauti: ive had school for 1.5 weels
SpadeMagnes[R]: But BronyState time it's November -- I stayed up this late just to do that :P
AJIsAwesome: I personally think it's quiet funny.
because trust me, Lain is a show that NEVER explains anything. It gives you all the information necessary to understand it, but makes YOU connect the dots.
twilight_sprinkle: 2 here
yeah!
00,10it just started for your Scoot-Scootaloo
TF2 at 39% :3
LOL
RAWRity: I had the same experience with RahXephon.
Er, September*
00,10like 1 whole min ago
/me Zzz
i like this song
twilight_sprinkle: School starts late here in NY, always day after labor day.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Why so Green Day? :O
Kawaii_icybeauti: I just don't know what "desu" means.
They're like...puzzles.
Reikim: what a coincidence, they're from the same guy!
00,03It's gonna be a long sleep :(
Lovely little puzzles.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDgk2YMzGpY&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Behold Derpface
Anyway
Ponies47 finally got your New Desktop?
AJIsAwesome: It actually mean "it is"
00,10and you will miss ponies Scoot-Scootaloo
Harmony is a universal force.
My birfdays in September, why would you sleep through that? :(
AJIsAwesome: needs more desu
Chiaki Konaka
Now to diverge a bit.
00,03EWWW Ponies :|
00,10cause it starts on the 22
/me uninstalls league of legends
Gotta look up that guy
Kawaii_icybeauti: yeah, my high school used to start 1st of september
Kawaii_icybeauti: So it's kind of like Yoda speak?
there, one less thing that can easily distract me
NullRadix: that'll give you a good amount of free time back.
00,03I hope theHubTVNetvvork didn't lie >_>
Kawaii_icybeauti: university starts earlier, but ends earlier i think
Sumica: Stop spreading the evil rumor! :D That's mean!
Wait so S3 starts the 22ND? O.O
So let's say that, long before ponies as we knew them, there existed Alicorns/.
00,10but I saw it on EQD
twilight_sprinkle: what happened? AJIsAwesome I guess you can say that.
As a race.
http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/desu
Is this legit?
00,10EQD is alays right
Sumica: Trolls got through again
HAH!
anyone who disagrees with EQD gets banned
end of rine
Sumica: That's ture I saw it on the internet on time
Ponies47: No. It was from HUBTVNETVVORK
ALWAYS
00,03Oh it was on EqD? Then it must be true! Everything they say there is true!
AJIsAwesome: O_O
And these alicorns eventually create a mighty empire.
Kawaii_icybeauti: nothing, i graduated from high school :D
all glory to our dragon fucking overlord
I think we shall all see Tom for this
This endures for a while, until Discord shows up.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
may his dildos forever be lubed
Whether they invited him or not, I don't know.
Buytoast: Amen
We don't even what the episode is in first place.
Discord exists to destroy Harmony, and he's happy to do so.
00,03Oh wait, Tom doesn't know, then it must be still unknown...
00,10I would find it funny as hell if it actaly dose start on the 22
But at the same time, Harmony can destroy Discord. Unfortunately, it's losing.
I would find it awesome
I need to play some more skyrim. But I ruined my character roleplay... I'll just pretend that didnt happen... yesh... yeah
Also, what if Discord wasn't the only Draconicus or whatever they're called.
BACK TO THE GAMEZ!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXhWRlg2QE8&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Needs more of this
00,10yes because tom is also always right
Universal order is going to fall apart.
RAWRity: it actually isn't the main drain on my free time, but it was roughly the ONLY drain today. I think I'm going to make it a policy that anytime I burn a full day on something I can't "complete", its time to get rid of it
00,10even when he forgets to be right he is right
Tom never talks much does he?
00,03Tom has solid proof!
He's a rock
bazinga
Sumica: Is Tom our Airdate bot?
00,03He is a stone cold tough as nails kind of bot!
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
The last bastion of the Alicorn Empire goes into full-on desperate mode and begins trying to exploit Harmony to combat Discord.
00,10that reminds me
They eventually succeed in isolating three Elements that together make up Harmony.
00,10:kickbot 6 9
Sumica: Setting kickbot to 6 messages in 9 seconds
*six
I'm so happy I have an AJ toy... THey didn't have fluttershy though the wankers.
They then go about refining these six until they come up with the Elements.
00,03lolol 69 lololol
...oh my god http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/423882_489715674381447_1863469047_n.jpg
Sumica 22 of September?
I'm getting soo much better at drawing ponies
hurr hurr hurr!
:D
...
Oh no, only six messages in nine seconds? Dang
yesl
i
One day I might do commissions.
00,10ok fine
i
PillowPoni: Good to hear! :)
00,10:kickbot 6 9.99
what a crossover
Sumica: Not a valid command, silly
Woah
Oh I aint gonna do another one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqELqRCnW6g&feature=BFa&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw Screw the Nether
Ravebrony: I know, rite?
Sweet jesus.
inb4 BerryPunch spam
http://derpy.me/Q8HD2
00,03You silly, silly filly~
And then these Elements are given to Luna and Celestia, two young alicorns, as the best potential alicorns.
Sumica: Berry Punch is too drunk to fraction.
00,10:kickbot make me a sanwich
Sumica: Not a valid command, silly
*bearers
Inb4 SB
They successfully bind Discord and restore universal Harmony.
RAWRity: that piece of art is beautimus
Lol! dat command
night
0,14we all do
Sumica: Me too.....:(
and then all the Alicorns died the end
00,03That's right BerryPunch, you are a strong, independant purple mare who don't need no man~
In order to preserve Harmony, the Elements then decide to make Luna and Celestia into goddesses.
BerryPunch is the town drunk
All the other alicorns are dead at this point, yes.
lol
So Luna and Celestia fix up the world a bit, and create the three pony races. Hell if I know why.
00,10doooooooo eeeeeet
All da color O.O
During this time, Equestria is founded.
NO I DONT LIKE ASIAN WOMEN!

Moopy: Yeah, probably not. :D Unless we bug him.
i desire victims- err, partners in MvM. who shall join me?
Does gravity not affect Mario?
Buytoast let's hope not
You still had fun though.
MirrorImage: Give me about 46 minutes hopefully.
Buytoast: that was likely another guy. There are a bunch of different people making MLP doujins over there.
<_<

SuperBrony64: is your sister home? Tell her to play some Minecraft. xD
...
Dammit
maybe you saw it earlier and don't remember?
No, I haven't touched XKCD in over two months.
And alright Moopy, I can respect that.
It's an impossibility that I'd have seen it.
And yet, I know that I've seen it before.
thanks dude
I knew the punchline already.
Rex_Mundi that thing you posted earlier only cost about $5? wow, cheap
mario!
Used concept.
This is disconcerting...
I love my new bed I got. I actally had it for a while, but only got it moved in with moving to my new apartment! It has adjustalbe head and foot levels, massage, and best of all, my Princess Celestia throw! :$
No, I specifically remember XKCD doing a comic on it before.

Hey look, it's our fandom.
Now that just seems mean. Making Yoshi eat something like that.

11,02No cookies? :<

Duct tape fixes all
So, you're playing a Wii without the Wii?
Pinkie Pie's location and activities are always known... She's always so full of cookies! :O
The top of my TV is rounded, so I had to tape my sensor bar too :D
PROTIP: Duck tape works *GREAT* for killing stinkflies

Rex_Mundi oh , no wonder it's cheap, but it's still cute
so how did you all like my movie pick? :3
After al, within the Bronies we've got the cloppers, the NLR members, the Solar Empire supporters. Those who are and aren't for grimdark/shipping/grimshipping. Not to mention the digital artists, teh traditional artists, the EDM musicians versus the more traditional musicians. Those who like S1 and not S2. all kinds of stuff.
ohai kirzstryfe
00,03MLG Movie was MLG kirzstryfe :)
speaking of movie, was lottery tonight?
There's people who like S1 and not S2?
MLG?
yup
The lottery is tomorrow.
or it a saturday lottery?
k
Rex_Mundi: :S
Okay, this level looks like a mindfuck...
Jackiechan.jpg.
I remember Pegacorn especially hated S2
ha
We have a mod here who swings that way.
I only saw the second movie and pony
Welcome to SMG, Mozdoc
Missed the first ones
which one?
Eh
I think it was fluttercry?
Lesson Zero especially
This fanzine is from Taiwan http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7lsmsbxq31r6zr2io1_500.jpg
NO
Anyway, cultures within cultures.

WAH

In Artland there's traditional/digital, anthro/pony, and so on.

...Why does that look so weird? XD
What the actual fuck
By the way kirz, I can't get on Stormbluff.

I was on no less than three different times.
It's like they're hamsters or something
ok, let me check stuff
Even off-peak, it's full.
My Little Hamtaro?
In the fanfic world...there is everything.
MirrorImage: ...Not sure if want :/
agreed
In the music there's every genre.
Better question is, Why the hell am I not creeped out by that, Rex_Mundi? :S
I hated this misison
So someone actually hates Lesson Zero? One of the more recommended episodes?
Meanwhile's gonna flip if we go to Fissure of Woe
Jeez, we are a nation cut in half.
Why, kirz?
DO IT FASTER
because I got him to move to stormbluff from there in the first place
yes, some Elbow Grease would do lovely for this
especially if it's highly flammable
You didnt destroy all the boxes, ILL PLACE MORE

Hey everypony, who's streaming?
Elbow Grease is highly flammable

Wow, that's harsh.
Pegacorn HATED lesson zero, so much that he left the fandom for a while after it

You almost had it.

Where the hay are these boxes coming from?!?!
WHo the hell thought this was a good idea?

You fail, again. Because of one fucking box.
Miyamoto did, apparently
ungrteful robot
Hey Everypony! :)
Huh, that's a new one.
only to come back so he could complain about it.
"Well maybe I could destroy them all if you STOPPED REBUILDING THEM!"
Ergh

Hi! I'm a robot! I have meters for eyes!
Honestly, I can't put up with that.
YAAAAY

Sure, you might hate an episode.
Fucking bad ass.
But there's not reason to go whining about it.
Moo moo, son. Moo moo.
huh, never did that strategy before
well shit, both of the movies I had in the tube have been picked for the lottery lately >.<

Worst Episode convos are, as I have stated, just as annoying as Best Pony convos.
Congratulations on BURNINATING like a machine. I am going to sit around on my fat wheels like a lazy organic unit and watch you
Vote Nudist Colony of the Dead for B.
might I suggest...Nudist Colon of the Dead?
I want to see this.

How bad we talking?
if you were to break everything
and your computer exploded
Ponies47: When this is finished downloading, which should be in a few minutes.
the error would be less wrong than that one
Okay
And after I get used to controls again
So what did he do?
Whoops we missed one
ah cool Mario Galaxy oh how was D-War? was it bad?:D
Again, Rex_Mundi; I'm not creeped out at all :3
Sketch_Toku_Brony I guess it was
Polydunami: Good, because its good art. Why get creeped out?
Also, dat big ol' Spike in the bg :3
Ponies47: i told mirror this, just please be patient and i'll join soon
Gaah, this thing keeps going from 10 minutes to 30 minutes and all
the ls.jar bit is simple enough, he somehow got /use/shar/Adobe/doc/example/android_vm/root/sbin/ in the path and searching for .jar's
you'll never find that green star
NocturnalBlade|Away: Okie :3
he went full retard.
OH god now it says an hour. *facedesks* You guys go on without me, I'll be fine~
^_^
yiffie!
your life will fade away as you struggle for completion
thats not actually all that simple, its entirely possible to make jar's executible (binfmt_misc) but its searching for .jar thats dificult
Not even for the green stars did I use a guide
I don't understand
only finding a cruel void of failure
ALthough it was a pain in the ass to find some of them
Traveling Galaxies... WORLD map... Seems legit!

hey klumzseedragon maybe tomorrow i got an i dea when superbrony64 starts the stream again around later im going to invite you guys in my party chat but i have to appear offline though so yeah
Hm, I wonder who that message was from...
Klumzeedragon: lol dose that make me a bad brony
:3
SuperBrony64: You NEVER use dirt for flooring for your house. Use wood panels, cobblestone, or stone
Or you could use glass, and have water underneath it instead SuperBrony64
Eddmario: if i get minecraft i will make my houes floor and all out of catus
11,02Cactus hurts when you touch it o.o
scottish-geeky: you can't have a cactus and another block right next to eachother
SuperBrony64: i lived in a disert im uest to it lol
Eddmario: thats why i will only ues catus
I've got some good-quality "wireless" headphones, but no sound comes out of the left speaker :(
My brother has a headset that came with a chat pad, and it doesn't even work anymore.
thats what happended to mine
hello...?
chat derp ftw
:S
hello Sirfilly
yay<3
SuperBrony64: moo at da cows
lol
11,02You can't hear my voice, but I am mooing ><
im going to play minecraft on my real profile name thats not for xbox live cause its my real name
SuperBrony64: moooo
Moo moooo moo moo moooo BronyState moo moooo moooooo ^_^
moo mooo mooo mooo moo moo
Ponies47: moooo
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO(Ponies47.EXE has stopped working)
disny wants are souls
wow
SuperBrony64: Go on a killing spree against everyone else
wat a question
its actually tough
uhhhhhh
for waht the death snetinse
Diamond Tiara is a slut. Silver Spoon's that black chick that has a big ass and looks like she hasn't showered in years
lolwut^
hummmmmmmm idfk
Eddmario: /)
I can link a sort of NSFW link that proves those too!
Well, the DT one anyway...
i would say diamond tiara is better if she can grow up and stop being a binch, whereas silverspon is just the yesman
Eddmario: umm ok
Ah crap I just remebered I'm going hiking tomorrow and I have to get up in about 6 hours :S
SuperBrony64: I'll give you a pony IRL if you go grief everypony else in the world
btw SuperBrony64 do you want that gold foil cadence card?
Ponies47: go sleep yung filly
11,02twilight_sprinkle: I have one already, but I wouldn't mind trading cards that I have for it :)
SuperBrony64: you don't need to put the powered rails so close together. The max distance the cart won't stop at is 15 blocks.
It just wastes resources
SuperBrony64: wow lol the only 1 gold card you have is the only 1 i have. but yeah, we could trade some stuff, id rather have twi rarity trixie cards than cadence
Pinkies4thWall: i wnat that controler
SuperBrony64: Go to your house.
11,02twilight_sprinkle: I have those cards and would be willing to trade them to you, send me a PM :D
And SuperBrony64 is taking a piss break...
SuperBrony64: eh tomorrow maybe, right now i need to go to bed

05as far as i know Dark_Horst
08,01Zia: it was the mos fun and most stressful weekend ive ever had
i see nothing :9 (dani)
is there a stream?
I wouldn't mind bronycon if it wasn't full of bronycon attendees
would definately blow my budget
08,01Zia: you should have seen BUCK, our attendees were wonderful
05if i visit the US ill bring the vikign flu with me
05muahahaha
:D
The US is doomed.
i thought there was always a stream here..
08,01not a single complaint or piece of drama
:(
:P
No, not drama or complaints
Im off! Bye everypony
:D
sheer creepiness
Mye TheMonstaMuffin
It's just down the street from me. And nuuuuu Wrek! We already have the Viking Flu. :P And the Pirate Flu.
05the worst thign that happend at buck could be considered a small disagreement in oppinions
cool smiley's
05so yeah
and that was the extreme of people misbehaving
:O:)>_>
Bye MaxTheBrony
well
anyone?
08,01Zia: heh, we just ha awesome people; i didnt see any creepiness at buck
unless you count dragging people from the audience and put them infront of 100+ people
05yes pony_6916?
with no warning
where's the stream? i thought there was always a stream here?
Oh suck it up Chrysalis.

08,01Zia: seriously, it had the most amazin atmosphere
jmo :P iknow

I have been wondering , at these cons , do haters come to ruin them?
05pony_6916: SuperBrony64 jsut ended his session, and I'd stream myself right now had it not been for a social event i need to attend in the hour
but still just as fun to whine about it

ah
08,01only 12, i think
MaxTheBrony: Though, y'know, when his 9 (or howevermany) lives run out, they could extend it.
:p
00,10the doctor lives for a realy long time and regenorates when he dies
thats epic
MaxTheBrony: It allows different actors to be hired for shorter periods of time in the same role.
00,02it seems he has as many regenerations as the writers find convenient
smart concept
xD
DAT SUMIPoNY
00,10well supposadly they get 13 Phase4

brony_90: Those do seem to be the options
brony_90: It's an episode of Dr. Who
brony_90: A British, cheap sci-fi series.
This is the 9th doctor of Doctor who
and a amazing one at that however the best being the 10th doctor
Rommulus: Yeah but that doesn't mean anything to non-whovians
True just my opinion.

brony_90: it's the standard irc commands
Anyone besides me looking forward to the new season of Dr. Who?
brony_90: Do a google search for IRC commands, but these are the basics:
Rommulus: me:)
brony_90: /nick [name] changes your handle
00,10you can auto compleat names by typeing a bit then hiting the tab key till it fills the name in
mica
Agrold, brohoof.
brony_90: /msg [handle] [message] sends a private message to the user named [handle]
tSparx: ok...
she is a spy!
00,10it's easyer to just open a pm by double clicking the name tSparx
brony_90: /me puts your text into a third-person RP style, and that's about it
oshit I'm missing some Dr.Who
Sumica: Not if you're a purist!
police: "ZOMBIES, GET ON THEE GROUND!! rapeing young wimen is illegal!" zombie: "uuuuurrrrrrgh" police: that... is really sexy in a really occward way!. Zombie: "uuuuuuuuuurgh" Girl: threesome!!! police: YAY!!! zombie: uuuuurgh! aaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!(mating call of zombie.)
Sumica: Or using an old-school client
Rommulus: do you know when tonight it airs?
I was told it aired tomorrow
00,10then use /query <usernam> tSparx
However you can download the episode from the interwebs

00,10oh I see what you are saying MASF123
goodbye every brony!
00,10the eqd spoiler ep post
Goodbye creeperhugger
00,10clames sep 8 th
Yeah
Warning to all ignorant ponies; The release date for seasons 3 still has yet to be announced. Also, when you hear a date from someone, DO NOT BELIEVE THEM RIGHT AWAY. Ask for source, analyse those source.
00,10I ihghly doubt they would start eps next week with out a single ad showing up on the hub.
ekips: Oh no, I'm aware that there are lots of Germans here :) I love it!
00,10seeing as it's become the flagship show for them
Never believe until tv program says so
So the episode released could be the 8th, but airs on the 22nd. :/
00,10they would probably have at least 2-3 weeks of play up for the eps
They could have re-worded that.
They probably would do that yeah Sumica, especially considering how it has improved ratings on other shows they have, so even 2 weeks of ads might give some extra revenue
so many gas ghosts
one week is too short, I agree with that
suddenly evil
Damn, I thought they were good guys
Suddenly derp
they even changed their color to evil
So evil
I'm gonna get drunk waiting for this Season to start.
I enjoy this kind of Zombie more
brb
EEEEEEEEVVIIIIIIILLLLLL
nah... walking dead is best zombie :3
what kind of zombies are in walking dead?
wibbly wobbly
Sumica, it was a glitch. The September 8th listing was on Treehouse TV, and the episode title referenced an already-aired episode of some 5-minute buffer show that THTV runs
plague zombies
Shaun of the Dead zombies are best zombies
so virus like and all?
like in RE?
00,10yeah i did't belive it Kandarihu
yes
00,10like I said I fully expect 3 weeks of play up for it
the new RE games suck
meeeh I saw that too many times
I did, until I manned up and read it in full.
The EQD link actually said "it will likely be in end of september" and that 8th was a mistake, but I don't know if their article was a correction of themselves
Wow, the Buffulo! Gonna feel a but upset for extincting them after watching that MLP episode. :/
Vivix, do you actually believe EQD?
Why not? They said the same thing sumica did
EQD is beyond unprofessional
well in THIS article
they said, 8th is a mistake, I dunno if they posted that image earlier, and that if it was september at all, it would be end due to 'few weeks run up'
CrimsonPhoenix, Zap2It was the source of the unprofessionalism. EqD only reported on it.
CrimsonPhoenix they are usually right when it comes to posting upcoming events but they have made past mistakes before.
the post I read said exactly the same as we did here
but they might have posted just the zap2it before, I don't know
true
oh gosh...I think I saw the article
EXACTLY? :S
well- almost
can't believe that people are considering photoshops
Lol.
" The Hub tends to announce new seasons of shows a few weeks in advance. If season 3 does start in September, chances are it will be near the end."
her name was robert paulson
I'll laugh if it starts in October. :D
O, sed nos scimus :$
I hope they bring out a good Nightmare night (halloween) episode would be a great birthday present!
i wnat more luna in the new season
MASF123, I won't be surprised
I agree more luna
It will be this fall, but due to 13 it might be later
when simpsons started on 13 they started in december, but that was due to a production mixup that made them ship back two episodes as "totally unuseable"
there will be a spin off with shining armor fighting pony crime
what happened to those episodes Vivix
The doctor
/me snuggles Vivix
I wanna see more ponies period
tSparx, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fd4uspchvE
well said
i´m SO hoping for a brony shout out....
well, it was during the beginning, and it- was animated as if it was a road runners cartoon, very rubbery, unscripted jokes, and cartoony, and Matt Groening and most of the directors hated it, it was absolutely terrible compared to their vision. So they shipped them back and begged fox for delay premiere
brony_90, no...just no
the borked episodes were included on s1 dvd
00,10no video pinks please Pearly
Pearly: Not during streams, unless you ask for it
they drove him mad
and then he went insane
Big ben got screwed
keeping her around sure, but less pop references is good
BAD WOLF
their balance now is good
so... what is dr. who about?! ... are they some sort of supernatural detective team n stuff?!
Vivix: They've yet to do anything utterly terrible, I trust them.
brony_90: So, the dude is a Time Lord
brony_90: And he travels through time
tSparx, me too- I was scared to death of the wedding episode, but oh god did I love it
brony_90: With a companion, usually
brony_90: And he solves problems in space-time
Dr. Who is about a timelord who is called the doctor. A timelord can be reincarnated 13 times before he does and this is the 9th
only 13?
The Doctor
Dr. Who?
where do you have this 13 times thing from?
he travels around in his tardis which is the big blue box and solves problems in time that should not occour
It's part of the old lore
They made it clear in the old series
they almost used up his charges...they will need a new story about that
he can only be reincarneted 12 times. He does have 13 "lives"
Thank you Agrold
00,10they are curently on number 11
Yeah, I bet that when the 13th Doctor dies, they'll still keep it going.
BAD WOLF
this one we are watching now is 9, David Tennant plays the 10th and Matt Smith plays 11
00,10you missed by a bit dr
Oh, no wait
00,10it's not 12 hr, it's a year and 12 hours
Is this the ep where he overshoots
happens
well that was awkward
just a tad
Damn, I thought this was BADWOLF
00,10lolwoops
Technically the whole season is about bad wolf
That ep is creepy as hell, and I love it
00,10the start of badwolf hinting
oh Ecklson why couldnt you star for more then just 1 season
he is the worst time driver ever
Rommulus: I honestly don't know much about the story, but...
he did the emotional side of the dr so well
12hours... 12 months... what the difference.. really..:)
The Doctor's personality DOES change with each regeneration, right?
Yes
Kandarihu: yes
As does his age
appearance
WHO SOILED THE TARDIS
likes and dislikes
all
dat spamkick
just travel back 12 months...
Dr. = M.D. only, clearly
lol
DaringDerpy: Right?
what in the link for this?
If mom catches me watching Dr Who, she might not take kindly to me playing PSO2 at anything more than 640x480 at mute
Might as well restart now
Why can't they just go backward?
he has no idea how the tardis works
he stole it
00,10cause space ships need air horns
DaringDerpy: What!? He's a TIME LORD, right? How can you be a Time Lord who doesn't know how to travel through time?
Dem airhorns
lol at dat sound xD
in one episode, the criminal woman told him that the tardis sound is actually the handbrake...normally it shouldn't do such noises
The doctor always land on a conveniant time
spaceairhorns are best horns
00,10tSparx, the tardis takes 7 to drive it properly
he knows how to use the tardis however it is ment to be operated by 6 timelords not 1 so there are complications
Welp bye Big Ben
in most points the tardis drags the doctor to points in time where things need to be fixed
Really? And he doesn't like the idea of bringing an entire family onboard the TARDIS?
doctors happy again
Sumica: So you're saying that he should have 6 other members of his species, and he's trying to pilot it himself?
Kandarihu: NOPE
00,10yep
Kk
00,10that is why he has a hard time landing where he should
He stole the tardis from a museam as the current tardis is a older model
If a crew of 7 is proper for the TARDIS, then bringing an entire family onboard would be the most appropiate thing for it.
Kandarihu: Seven Time Lords
Kandarihu: There aren't six other Time Lords, period, anymore.
Well he would need to teach them and that just wouldnt be fun XD
so we are watching a tv show tv show
tvception
tSparx, so a human can't be part of the crew, just a passenger?
00,10more or less.
Kandarihu: It seems that way. Time Lords are kinda magical, humans probably couldn't figure it out as well as a Time Lord.
00,10they can help but realy it takes a time lord to drive it
They can its just its complicated
I would try to steal a piece of it and offer it on ebay. Infinite money. :)
Hi
a columbia depris piece rose to $16mio in a few minutes
Hey DeadpoolDash and CCCP !
how you doing CCCP
as a tardis is a very complicated piece of machinery that is both living and machine and the pilots would need a understanding of time and space so they could pinpoint their destinations
hello
hello CCCP
then they deleted the auction -.-
Hi CCCP
Hi tSparx

DaringDerpy: I thought SUmi said we weren't doing Rifftrax!

I left because I didn't wanna watch it without :/
What movies were on movie night?
tSparx, OHh rifftrax, epic
The Doctor knows how not to spoil
Oh micky why you no run faster

hi guys :) Wait ....GODAMN IT I JUST MISSED DOCTOR WHO :(
Are the episodes just going straight through the seasons or are we doing suggestions?
AdamTheDuck, MY SIDES
Now I know where this picture was from :D
Ah, so this is VOD
We watching the old series ? cool :)
hello every one
Hi
Hello cow334
hi Cow :)
I like this british De Lancie
Sergio_Scriptor: The old series is Doctors 1-8, new series is Doctors 9, 10 , and 11
hello Rommulus AdamTheDuck and Sergio_Scriptor
tSparx: u know that,but i call it the old series anyway :D
kk then ;)
00,10technicly this is the new new series
sup cow
00,10series 3
For the people who have watched more, what is your favourite companion?
nop Sergio_Scriptor
Rommulus: Rose,Amy and Rory :)
Can't you see the OC ;~;
Sumi is streaming I'm assuming
Sergio_Scriptor: sumica
oh yeah :D sorry Sumica :)
For me it is Amy and Rory
so wait...all those ETs are linked?
THIS IS GOING ON FACEBOOOK\
They look like sillier Gorons
aawww yeeeaaa
what are we watching.... that thing looks like a baby with a big body
that was campy
I did not notest you OC sumi,sorry :$
We are watching Doctor who
with the 9th doctor
^
sumipony
<.<
and then nobody believes him
You dont say mr military man
so what are you guys favoritre doctor ? :)
tennant
10th Tennant
I really lik the tennant run
*like
is it wrong to think the alien faces looks like the newborn cuties ponies http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/3441/48362940.gif ...
mine is tennant and smith :P
Tom Baker and David Tennant.
See, this is just cheesy xD
not wrong, Agrold
i dont care what they say,i think smith is doing a decent job as the doctor :P
Of course not Agrold, they are both terrifying and monstrous
Agrold, absolutely not
looks like a baby
haha:P
same, Sergio_Scriptor
Sergio_Scriptor: I don't think *he's* bad, I hate the writing of the latest Who
Smith is definatly doing a good job as the doctor, he plays it well it was just unfortunate for him to come after tennant
Rommulus: exactly,i bet if he came before tennat it was david that would be getting all the hate :|
Lawl no.
Smith is a bad actor.
...
oh boy here we go
00,10ohhi dari
And he made the Doctor his own
not sure about tennant getting the hate because he is still a really good doctor
don't fall for the bait
what are we watching?
Just he made his Doctor shite.
Also the new doctor who writing is good...i mean The Silence :) how could you not like them ? :)
Hey Sumi.
cow334: Dr. Who
So picky.
that....is totally not creepy
tSparx: oh thanks for telling me
I think both Tennant and Smith have both good and ad momments. I eally like alot of the earlier Tennant episodes, but in the end, especialy the last few minuttes, he got a bit too emo for my taste
I believe is you put matt in spot of the 9th doctor then everyone would of loved him
jaymoo pls
NOT CREEPY
dabi
pls
isnt that the point dari
to make it your own
It's not Sergio_Scriptor
...dafuq?
Each actor makes the Doctor their own.
Different
And Matt Smith's Doctor sucks dick
how did 2 of them hide behind a door!
Matt Smith is good and so was tennant
nice to meet you
so she couldnt just have done that in the first place....]
likewise
Explained so many times already
I'll just PM you what I said last time
so the aliens weakness is fire extinqushers
00,10every one likes her
she is awesome
alexxm, whatever screws up their body chemistry
matt Smith makes the doctor seem a bit more alien, and imho, I think that's a good thing. But again it's MY opinion:)
Amy's a bitch, Rory's pretty cool.
indeed :d
I enjoy amy and rory together not alone however
interesting detail
oh god my sides
00,10I love the doctor's pulling a supprise out of his ass.
is this speilberg's twilight zone?
wait is that sopossed to be the doctor?
Guten Tag, Herr Buytoast. Wie geht es ihr?
I swear he look diffrent in the trailers
Buytoast: Dr. Who
cow334: Different actors play the doc
Ohai everypony!
That was some wonderful bluffing with the Sonic Screwdriver
Hello Jim
how you doing Jim
I agree
tSparx: What happend to the old one
cow334: There have been 11
alexxm, Good, except that I'm exhausted from job
we are watching the 9th at the moment
whats your job Jim
tSparx: 11 seasons? or episodes
00,1011 actors
cow334: 11 actors that play the Doc
theres 11 doctors so far however most doctors have done more then 1 season
cow334: More than 11 seasons, I think anyway
00,10one actor was a movie only
alexxm, I direct/stop cars during road construction
each doctor is a different actor
tSparx: ho-holy shit
so dr who is black?
really Sumica? I didnt know that
thats is pretty cool never seen a serios like that before
00,1010th and 11th got two seasions so far
Rowan Atkinson is best Doctor
Buytoast: No no
00,108th doctor iirc was a movie
8th doctor is best doctor:3
also matt smith said he is going to be the doctor until at least 2014 :P
Buytoast: The Dr. is the dude with the short brown hair who locked himself in the room
David Tennant is best doctor
tSparx: that sounds pretty awesome so they die at the end of every season
Rommulus, Agreed
cow334: Not every season, some get more, some got less.
00,10this one only lasted one season
There will be a new season today! Can't wait for the new adventures of the Doctor!
oh, so that skinhead is the doctor?
tSparx: it keep the show interesting :)
00,10yeah
That was one of the points that made it for me for ecklson
Buytoast: The guy with the screwdriver
Hanging with the blonde
when he says sorry to the secretary
Anyway, you're the one streaming right, Sumica? How many episodes are we gonna watch today?
tSparx: aaah okay then I got to watch a episode pretty soon this looks amazing and the way they do it as well
im i the only that thinks that the 9th is a little...Dull ?
Yea he was at times however when he got into the more darker emotional points he was very good
cow334: I think it's okay, I like it but it's far from my favorite TV show. It's done cheaply, on purpose, but the story behind the terrible special effects is really, really good.
yeah :) true
cow334: Or at least fun :P
Sergio_Scriptor: I love the end of this doc's tenure
Tennant kept the audience entranced with his personality creating not a single dull moment.
tSparx: woot woot I got to give it a try ...dont really know what is going o right now so to me its all good right now
What a shame that would've been...
Not so stupid
also what actor do you guys want for 12th doctor ? :P
Oh well now mamma we all go to hell.
Rowan Atkinson again
movie?
Sergio_Scriptor: Michael Gambon
Sergio_Scriptor: Not really, yet that would be cool
Sergio_Scriptor john de lancie
passwords...
Rowan was a doctor?
alexxm: that would be cool]\
Sergio_Scriptor: I think it'd be neat to see Stephen Fry. Or, a female Dr.
For a sport relif episode, CrimsonPhoenix
rowan did a parody on the doctor
Ooh Pat Stewart'd be good!
He was so good
yeah
sport relif?
He is not a actor but Stephen Malkmus
relief*
I probably got that name wrong. The guy who played David Lister in Red Dwarf
again sport relief?
it means he stood in when the guy got hurt playing hand-egg
can you guys imagine if Hugh Laurie played the doctor ? :d
BADWOLF?
CrimsonPhoenix: Comic relief
"I need my vicodin " :D
wait, they play slippy dippy grassy kicky over in europe
Sergio_Scriptor: That'd be AWESOME
I see
chuck noriss be the doctor.
tSparx: it would be hilarious :D
Chuck Norris would be hilarious but wouldnt fit
Wait could there be any chance the doctor being a girl?
alexxm: yeah good enough too :P
Yeah cow334
I think.... I think he might be facetiously suggesting that it does not, in fact, narrow it down.
So, you can kill them with toothpaste?
we never had a black doctor :P
/me brushie brushie
cow334: It's never happened before, but the doctor's incarnation doesn't even need to be human-looking
We ALMOST had a black Doctor instead of Matt Smith.
Sergio_Scriptor, If he only was a ginger
A good actor...
;_;
Jim: :D yep
will smith?
denzel washington?
hahaha
inb4 ban
Will Smit as the Doctor would ROCK
B&
boom
Vinegarred to death
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeew
Whoa o.o
Will Smith atw
tSparx: aw well i guess then but it sill would have been awesome
eewwwwww aline spoooog
Why is Phase4 not mod-coloured?
nice
I don't think we'd want Will Smith as the Doctor
alien*
tSparx, i left my colours in linux
He's dead, Jim.
Phase4, ah, kk, I was worried you'd been fired or something :P
Phase4: :d you are one of us now >: I
Sergio_Scriptor, :P
dabimad?
Phase4 has been reduced to a mere commoner :P
dun dun duuuun
YEAH
This guy....makes me think so much of DeLancie
'swhat he gets
Love you too dabi.
<3
all dem doctors are spys
Now you owe me a dinner and movie.
There should be a keyboard with an inverted cross
man, he looks like a fat facedjohn c reily
wait so the doctor is not even human is he a aliean or something
alien
._.
cow334: he is a timelord :)
cow334: correct
cow334: His species is the timelords
cow334: he can regenarate,and live way more thena regular human,and also has 2 hearts :3
Next person to enter chat must watch every episode of G3 ponies
why doesn't he throw vinegar on them
....timelord so he can controll time and space
cow334: Yeah he's 900 years old right now, approximately.
cow334: Not quite, but he's tasked with protecting it.
he cant control it
cow334: kind of :\ not anymore thoug
Buytoast, he doesn't have any?
tSparx: that is awesome
CCCP well I've been here since 8:00 a.m.

Sergio_Scriptor: so he gaurds it then baisclly
Buytoast, he doesn't have the tardis
he watches over time and space to make sure that nothing goes amiss that isnt ment to happen in time and to do this he uses his time machine called the tardis
cow334: exactly :)
he's stuck in that room
go all flash and speed force and all that
Sergio_Scriptor: cool then
MAF123 and..?
His preferred tool of choice is the sonic screwdriver because he doesnt like guns
I just realised that I've been listening to Catgroove for the past 3 hours.

LoGaN they sometimes do *hugs* <3
River Song is actually my favourite character in all the Matt Smith eps

ALL DEM BABAYS

He was a amazing character
He didn't die
dabi died instead.

Don't you remember?
00,10need some captan grabass
Meh
uncle ben...from spider man
You don't see him die
nah.. the master always escapes:)
So you don't know he's dead
i hope he is alive .'(
Uncle Ben Reiley is dead...? :O
:'(
i still want to see the master being the doctor's companion :) it would been so AWESOME :)
00,10adventure or sheppards pie
it would be an amazing thing!
Sumica: sheppard's pie is pretty damn tempting
10th said he'd look after The Master ;_;
Sergio_Scriptor i think that happend in the animated version where richard grant was the doctor
he was going to be the doctor's companion....BUT THAT RED BITCH SHOT HIM :|
;_;7
who is the master
cow334: the only other time lord alive
The Master is a Timelord like The Doctor
Hey Everypony! :)
Hi DerpDash
Sergio_Scriptor: woot woot can the doctor go see him
;_;
Hello DerpDash
Hai DerpDash

Sergio_Scriptor: Woot woot ^^
this blood is really salty!
ooooh dddaaammmnnn
You ever had a coke bottle that requires a knife to open? Bloody hell tahts just the icing on the shit cake isnt it. Excuse my language. I feel rather depressed... and enraged.
I'd love to watch the badwolf episode, but I can't stick around for that long.
Well, Sumica wanted to get used to streaming The HUB on Saturday Mornings. And it seems he's getting Dr Who from VOD
this was one of ecklsons BEST episodes!
how you doing TheRandomkid321
:O
yes
Exterminate!
oh my god the chills, so many fond memories
I'm out, to sleep I go.
/me Zzz

Good night tSparx

Stargate ? now ? D:
alexxm I don't know. I'm just sad okay?
POUND PUPPIES?
What are we going to watch?
no
small tanks that hate you
audio scrtchy
just no
:(
the hub acts like pound puppies is the best thing
never seen this show before
/me shrugs
Kandarihu: I guess Sumi wants to be prepared in case they show ponies early right? Of course, hopefully they'll show them at 1 PM like they did near the end of Season 2. That would benfit me more so I don't have to get up as early either (Plus you can guys can seque into movie night following the episodes)
aww hell no!
Some people just cant handle change
no
Oh that's good. Just what I need a bunch of colourful happy ponies intended for bloody 6 year old children! Once again sorry! I am just really bucking angry!
then go it something

GASP
Because Ponies is next
CCCP: at least it's still beter then the new care bears series o_o
hooray
that one girl sounds like that boy from rugrats
Yeah :D
what happened to strawberry shortcakes? :(
It's like we had to watch the last few moments of Shortcake during Season 2 before the new pony ep started
One of my cats was traumatized by a little girl when she was a kitten.
pound puppies is awesome
woot woot
shortcake was cool. this is not
RUN!
thats like 3 evers thats like 4ever
4 ever,and ever,and ever >: )
O_O
O SHIT!
Oh, okay. Prince Fudgypaws is a gerbil
...and you can talk
HOLY BUCKING CRAP! I JUST REALISED HOW BUCKING ORIGINAL THAT CHARACTER DESIGN AND PERSONALITY IS! Sorry. I just probably should leave this site before I get banned for good.
This needs |Tom Rugger writing it like he did on the old Pound Puppies show. At least that one was funny
Why are we watching Pound Puppies?
Nope
No, not just like HER! To get pets adopted by humans who are MORE RESPONSIBLE than her
DerpyMuffins: Becasue Ponies is next
Inb4 the kid gives out the secret and everyone thinks shes insane
He just turned into it early
it aactually pretty good
D:
the animation in that show as pretty bad
ponies :)
aawww yeeaaa
Isn't every HUB family movie always the same?
I like Pound Puppies! D:
Lesson Zero

Oh good Lesson Zero

Dat checklist

But...how to did she create that First checklist? o_o
If you want to see just one movie September...come here
God I don't even want to watch ponies now. Ya know what? It kind of repulses me.
Rommulus, haha
Ravebrony: me too D:
TheRandomkid321: I agree
in the beginning, there was nothing. then she made a checklist. and it was good
Its a never ending cycle of checklists! :D

They should have gotten Aisha Tyler instead of Tori Spelling.
JESmith, that be nice
alexxm: she had a popular show as teen star in the early 90s. now she is old
oh yeah!
Lesson Zero?

DaringDerpy, you mispelled Rarity

Sumica: Simple give the box to Pinkie she'd just eat them all in one go anyway

00,10kinda makes you wonder what Twi has seen celestia do to make her think she would do these things
dat smile
Sumica: nightmare moon ?
it begins
I like the bgm
Sumica: true..wait then that would mean O-o
Well she sent Luna to the moon for 1000 years
then made her apologies
00,10I dont think Twi saw that cow334
Sumica: Very true :D
00,10er Sergio_Scriptor
AQUABATS
Princess Celestia is as much feared as much as she is loved. But she is certainly not hated.
Sumi what?
Sumica: but she heard about it :\
Aquabats!
huuuh
one thing I hate from Hasbro
Baby Alive
NO WAY
CrimsonPhoenix, as long as it flops, it's all good
:3 Thats right kids, go bug your parents and make them take you to chuke cheese
Kandarihu, it's been around for a good long while
00,10still if you saw someone do noting but good, would you realy think they would do somthing so bad?
where is the my little pony pillow pets
:D this is a plushie comercial ?
CrimsonPhoenix, oh well. Different strokes, I guess.
Hats?
HATS
Dad is looking swag in that monkey hat :P
I don't mind the fact that it's for little girls and all, that's cool
i dont need to see comercials for this,i can buy a Twilight Sparkle plushie :3
it's just how creepy they look
Belly Bros
Well, I see the Pillow Pets were successful.
00,10hehe, hub thought carebears would be as big a hit as ponies
At least when the Season 3 ads start playing here (Espically if it's during the Saturday repeats) we'll know it before EqD
Silly hub
Sumica: silly hub :3
I like watching Carebears highlights on The Soup
dat scream
Lightning doesnt strike twice in the same place
Sumica: Well its mainly about Celestia being high power :D I know if i was a 'student/assistant' of the president id be scared out of my Wits if i didnt do something he asked :D
poor rarity
Huh. Rather Smile song trot there.
THE
:'(
WORST POSSIBLE
THING
Rarity time!
Inb4 Cute!!
this is the worst possible thing!
*Flip
Rarity does best pout
Wonder if they'll play them during the Wedding rerun. Who knows
Rape face :d
hahaha
poor Rarity
agreed rarity does best pout
oh there it is
00,10wait dont you have a spell for finding gemstones rarity?
yea!
silly rarity
Hehe
Sumica, gemstones, not ribbons
"you think I would really lay on the ground?"
Maybe it doesn't work if it's in ribbon form?
that chair is epic
00,10diamoend encrusted ribon CrimsonPhoenix
too small?
Twilight pulled a batman
dat sun
Sumica: But she has to have lots of gems in there :D and she cant find specific ones :P
Her house is filled with gemstones. Her revealing gemstones spells will light up her whole house
00,10would narrow down the search Ravebrony
Shes used to finding piles of gems
so are you people ready to join modern gamers with the glorious and superior EA Origin?
Buytoast, I'll stick with Steam thank you
Sumica: But its Rarity, drama must be included! :)
Dont make me laugh
Buytoast: ehr...no ? :\
Nice. After 2 or so days of being unable to join Brony State chat, I come back to lesson zero.
00,10AJ gimi that hat, I will trade you 10 mann co crates

RAINBOW

hahaha
HUBOOOM
00,10I still prefer atomic rainboom

This show is filled with disabled ponies
Sumica, same
Twilight has OCD and Luna has DID
finish him
Yeah, I kept getting a Flash Player error promt.
bear wrestling time
FATALITY
:D
the bear didnt want to be her friend
Such a key episode for so much fandom <3
DerpyMuffins, DID?
and pinkie pie is well... pinkie pie
Twilight definatly doesnt have OCD
:D
00,10pony_4042 were you geting that on all flash sites our just here?
>_>
Gollum scene :)
Just here. The Video would not load, and the error was in the chat.
Sumica: Happens to me every now and then but usually a refresh clears that for me
It said to download a chat program or something
I updated my Firefox, but not my Flash
00,10then it sounds like you had an advertisment
ok that was pretty creepy
Twilight has pressed childhood memories :P
*repressed
00,10adblock+ would prevent that
poor twilight =(
Now that I've seen LotR, I see the Gollum reference there
I do have adblock.
Oh Pinkie :D
00,10because any flash error would not be limited to just this site
like a pinke
Luna has Dissociative Identity Disorder
THIS THE
The Worst Possible Thing!
WORST
Balloons! because gravity works that way
the hell did pinkie do that for
POSSIBLE THING
how are you

Tarde
S1E3
Twilight has OCD, Luna has DID so does Fluttershy, Celestia has Mommy issues, and Pinkie is crazy
of MLP
ticket master?
yea
UHHH
AAAAAAARGH
Right after Rarity mentions not wanting to lay on the grass, Rainbow Dash lays down on the tablecloth
Although it happens all the time when I try to use it on the Guest account on my mom's computer at home when I visit. Which is just weird because I do it under her account instead of the Guest it works
Oh Rarity, lmao
dat grunt noise :d
Sumica: Thats true not every one is nice friends or foal
remember when Rarity sings about what she would do wit the ticket?
00,10Pinkie is not crazy, she just trolls
I love you Rarity <3
yes
oh no!
ok
Pinkie Pie has her own disorswe
disorder*
Rarity sings about Princess Celestias NEPHEW Prince Blueblood
/me snuggles LoGaN
CCCP: are you gay?
00,10do have to say they suddenly advertiseing the ep like this is odd
dem bitches
Is the rumor of Rainbow Dash getting a boyfriend in season 3 true? I heard it was on Lauren Faust's DA account.
Rerun will never be as awesome as original airing :) Never!
but hes not an Alicorn, and we only see him one more time
yeah we won't see any ads for season 3 this week
Sumica: Yeah forget Twilight, they're ain't no pony trollin' down like Pinkie
00,10I wonder if they want us all to watch for some reason
pony_4042: nah it's fake :P
brushie brushie brushie
hopefully in the middle of the month or the first beginning of it
Well, it's a good episode anyway
Again, maybe first Season 3 ads will play during it?
Oh. Thought she was hooking up with that male Wonderbolt.
00,10pony_4042, when in doubt go to the sorce and see for your self.
pony_4042: that would be cool :)
A Brush is a brush - Arent they all the same?
does anyone understand my question?
"normal hair" *winces*
Wait a minute. An ad for Season 3 will probably contain spoilers for at least the season premier.
Cypresswolf: not for the wrong type of grils :|
*girls
it's always double
there were lots of discussions about this on ponychan, Master. I think they agreed that he is adopted or something
00,10yep Kandarihu
just call it wrong hair
what happens to Prince Blueblood, and how is he related to Celestia, if he's not an Alicorn
00,10hub was doing that in s2
oh yeah!
00,10spoiling the next weeks eps
I heard Blueblood was supposed to be a Duke, but they made him a Prince instead.
I'LL MAKE A FRIENDSHIP PROBLEM
s3 y u no here now
I hated those ads :D
silly twilight the tock isnt ticking thats the sun
silly twilight
Hi guuurls
HEY GIIIIRLS~
clock*
Here comes the insane Twilight
:D
O-o
dat ear twitch
/me nomz CrimsonPhoenix
fun fact: this was exactly the same nest as in winter wrap up
hurro everypony
dat eye twitch
MasterBrony, many generations removed, as Faust mentioned.
hu gggguurllss
GRRRReat! ^_^
the one that twilight made
sup Flyboy
LoGaN no i said no already
I am here to apolagise for my diorderly behaviour earlier. I am currently going through a really hard time in my life. My grandfather probably won't live to see october.
well twilights finally snapped
00,10I realy like her voice crack
this Twilight is so cute :3
that squeak
oh sorry to know that TheRandomkid321 :(
pony_4042, this whole limitation with royal titles has really screwed them up. Everypony in the royal family is a prince or a princess, and only one of them is the reining monarch.
LoGaN but i guess that means no huggies :(
its alright Random, we understand.
apple bloom and apple jack are cool
ok, ill try and iscuss this question laterz, when everypony is not too distracted
CCCP: hugs<3
TheRandomkid321 :( im sorry
I still like pinkie pie
there is no crown prince. celestia doesn't like the thought to share power
Where did Twilight learn the Want it, Need it spell?
thats my sis twilight
I wonder if Twilight learned that spell from Cadence.
00,10that is understandable TheRandomkid321, but please do try to direct your rage.
squeak
You're going to LOVE SMARTY PANTS!
Technically, though, Celestia IS sharing the power with Luna, though.
lol
Whenever emotions run high especially due to family problems it can be really hard to deal with it, you are forgiven Random. ^.^
books, DerpyMuffins
00,10lashing out randomly is a quickway to make every one dislike you
e'yup
Good thing i missed it then :o
well that was easy
nope
THAT INCREDIBLE AMAZING DOLL
bon bon
STICK TO ONE VOICE :|
Big Mac gets all the mares
she is a voice actor
O-O
and i came here in time for ponies! :)
she do what she want, cause shes a strong independant pony
Sergio_Scriptor, I like bonbon's voice range
YOU BROKE THE RULES!
CrimsonPhoenix: i like it too :P
lol rainbow with the glasses on
I really should be the one apolagising. And I agree Sumica. I just had a really hard time recently. At school I am contantly tormented by a bunch of idiots one has the guts to call himself a brony despite being one of the most mentally insane people I know.
mayor mare can really run fast...for as old as she is
He cuts people for pleasure. FOR PLEASURE!
00,10like I said TheRandomkid321, I understand ^_^
whoa nelly
did twilights family know smarty pants
O-O MI GOD
someone has a different mindset than me
I', GONNA BE MAD
but i LIKE cutting people
ermahgerd
cow334: oh their god
TheRandomkid321, I know the feeling
Scrunchy Derpy
you so screwed twilight

Buytoast, OH YEAH EQD IS NEVER WRONG
00,10lol
Buytoast: what about the Luna Game incident ? :|
Wrek: bc your art rocks
oh look 2 ponies and a chicken
It seems all of Twilight and her friends have a mental disorder
NEVER
and it's always true.
WRONG
Hey Sumi are you going to be streaming the reruns every week until the premiere?
Wrek its because your the best artist ever..
EQD might be reliable for stuff here and there
Lord Dragon Sucker of Trixieshire can never be incorrect
END OF RINE
Rommulus: a pony a dictionary and a chicken
Buytoast: even when EQD published The Luna Game? :\
END

00,10more or less JESmith

Derpy?
derpy!

Once my mag hits LVL 95, it'll be stuck in one branch for the remainder of it's existance. It's almost time.
Best by a nickname for Derpy!
DaringDerpy: never heard of her :\
*Must be
wait.. scootaloo flew for a few seconds there, never noticed that before:O
CCCP, WELP This world is doomed
Kandarihu: what game?
DaringDerpy: relly?
Eli, Phantasy Star Online 2
CrimsonPhoenix i'd hope so its about time
/me yawns, then stretches
Kandarihu: wait what level are you

Cthulu 2012. Why vote for a lesser evil?
Sumica i guess
platforming dan
oh holy shit
no id dint say cheese
I don't know what to say about Chukee'sredesign
00,10you know the leader of china has proclamed that he dont shit right?
when you say orignal games,i think you mean copied games with diferent re-skins :|
i amost forgotten how much they fucked up chuckie cheese
Hunter13 Ranger17 Force16
Chucke's**
wait. they changed Chuck e Cheese. WTF?!
00,10and people belive it
CrimsonPhoenix: At least Chuck doesn't have this new voice in the shows in the stores yet
057 more watchers and i break 600 :o
GRORIOUS READER NO SHIT FROM MAJESTIC POOPER
do we have a term for "like" obsession yet?
NullRadix: dont think so :\
I need one!
no
you got weird toys over there...
facebook is dying anyway
00,10you have no idea Eli
Facebook is dying. At a slightly faster pace than WoW
this toys are nothing but plastic grabage...what happen to the oold hand-made wooden toys ? :'(
it'll probably still be around for another 10 years
I like the pillow pets
00,10I men i saw this one toy that was just plastic horses with brushable hair
:( Rob Renzetti
Sumica: i'm gonna come over to live there in 2 years, so i'm gonna find out :)
maybe the wedding episode could lead to the premaire
NullRadix: but not the user base
haha rarity has always somehting royal to lay on
They actually got the guy who narrates that Rich & Fabuluos series?
that's funny
How many hours until the wedding episode
They just let a kid walk around like that?
you mook
Filly AJ is cute
agreed
Facebook will probably reinvent itself to stay alive. The taxpayer gravy train is about to be derailed.
how old are they? 150 years?
Rommulus, next weekend
Aj is now Rarity
Thank you Pearly
:D
I stil dont get,what exactly did applejack screwed up :\
Quick question. Do any tf2 bronies here host a mvm server? The 2 unlocked servers I can find never load.
She left home
6am pst 9est
....
she seems like a real fancy pony thing :\
We'll have you acting like a true Manehattenite in no time = That atrocious grammer and accent has to go
Dafuq is this you want me to eat
And she said she cant speak fancy
that little stuff on that plate
00,10wait a tick.
I likeher accent
i love this epesiode
boom
Dat filly running!
<3
A pony could starve in the city
me too
Filly Mac <3
00,10they said the eps are at 10am in the ad for next week did't they
Colt
..d;esamg
sfniujdsaznbv

apple farmer forever
Soory
eeeyup
Colt Mac
big macintosh is best big brother
hi thelonepony
queue discussions about the location of cloudsdale vs ponyville. unless flight camp isn't in cloudsdale
I deserved that
pony_4042: Sometimes the mods here set up TF2 servers and stream matches on here. If you're here during that time you can get in on it
i should watch that part in german... she doesn't have an accent to begin with in german
hey thelonepony
Less physical activity probably means the metabolism will be lower.
00,10intersting they are pushing back the pony eps 3 hours
woot time for fluttershy storry
hey spitfirecolt2
Sumica: Yeah they did, just like today
story*
if granny smith is a grammy who is ajs and bm mom
LoGaN: they are dead :'(
hay pearly
00,10no JESmith today it started at 7am
You dont say, FS :o
Could of never guessed
LoGaN, I just hope we find out in S3
aww
00,10see 7am
Sumica: Do they mean 10 AM EST? Because it's 10:30 over here
i know
LoGaN, good point
00,10no they meens PSt because this is a pst brodcast
they where shown at the end of the wedding
That would be nice. The Nightmare Moon and Rainbow Dash MVM servers keep getting the 'Server not responding' error message when I try to join them.
Woah, Sumica, where do you live? Are you the one in Vegas?
I keep forgetting the time zone differences between us
Flight Camp
I still think AJ's parents are roaming for seeds like Granny Smith did in her youth
00,10yeah Ravebrony
Ah
this is how rd killed fs
And nopony goes to save her....
LoGaN: Lauren Faust sais she wanted a episode where applejack needs to deal with her parents death,but it was canceled due to being to dark for a season 1 :|
cause im frrreeeeeee, freeee falling
00,10I might add that is also the time they showed ponies for most of s2 as well
Sergio_Scriptor: Omg D:
oh
what the fuuuuuuuck...
i like the new time
death is a no no in this show
10 AM is 1 PM for me. Good I hope they keep that time again for the new S3 eps
death, nope to the moon!
...O-O
00,10yeah i kind liked that time as well, it ment I could sleep in
Think about it, all the Apple family have their own orchards all over Equestria - perhaps they're looking for more places to expand their apple empire - A ponified Johnny Appleseed
no
Augmented Reality! The future of Dennou Coil is still possible!
Sumica: as mentioned earlier: weird toys!
Ad said 10 eastern, 7 pacific
it's 4pm for me. good time
00,10not realy a toy though Eli. that was an app
Augmented Reality? I never asked for this.
12:42 am
It'll be fun for approximately 3.7 seconds
I'll stick with my headlight slippers from sky mall, thank you :)
ponys dont come on till 12AM here...
marketin departments make weird products
Sumica: i meant the stumpees
+g
Wait let's see if they show that ad again and see if it said EST like Adam said
00,10oh
what is this place filled
inb4bestsong
aawwww yyeeaa
time for a singalong!
00,10eww, this song
what's this WHAT'S THIS? There's color everywhere
00,10lets see what else is on tv
going to the WC,be back in a bit :\
:D
XD
Never really liked Fluttershy......
D:
/me loves this song
dat fluttershy
hehe
me too
/me agrees with Agrold
ditto
Fluttershy sounds kinda annoying to me
Regardless tho, you cant Hate Fluttershy :D
What's this? What's this? There's birdies in the air. What's this? What's this? There's bunnies everywhere
Agrold, I have the unofficial soundtrackand I am addicted to that song
too cute
00,10wait, if the sonicboom disapatited all the clouds
:P
There's children throwing snowballs instead throwing heads!
00,10then dash just killed all the spectators
I have to be WATCHING in order to not hear that and think that she's being a Pegasus Supremacist.
LOL
ducks cant fly...
oh look new clouds
they formed quickly
wut?
O-O or can they
Er, wait. Let me fix that:
Ducks can fly :p
and that's how you get a tatoo on your ass
Rarity time! Awww yeeeah!
I have to be WATCHING in order to hear that and NOT think that she's being a Pegasus Supremacist.
Can't unhear Yaplap's version of that song.
morning
00,10I meen just think of that poor earth filly that was on the clouds
awww yea!
time for Rarity's Quest
00,10lol that digital skip
Time for THE ROCK!
patiens is a virtual
o dat cheerilee
time for tom
Green is not your color Scootaloo
that slight stream freeze... and the facial expression I think I saw...
shes sooo cute
:D
I...wonder what the performance was about... O_o
Rarity's Quest
lol
00,10Loved that look on her face
Morning, all you crazy kids.
OMG A GIANT ROCK
.
and how she gets backs
The Sonic Rainboom has never been known to dissapate clouds. They probably have the potential, though. But even if it did, Rainbow Dash is at a safe distance.
hello DocSane!!!
That would be so fun
Rarity and rocks.
Dumb Rock!!!
Follow your nose!
I will never understand.
its a mistory
dumb rocl
She will probably marry a guy named rock.
I want a flashback episode to when all the characters were kids.
hey dont steal pinkies rock! thats her east field!
00,10they showed it disapating clouds Kandarihu
how old IS Colgate
speaking of Fluttershy: the german version is not so bad overall. AJ has no accent, most of the voices are weird, and some of the names just sound plain ugly in german. but that's all fine, the worst part is: Fluttershy doesn't squee!
Sparkly Dancing Food
Full Grown Derpy in crowd.
I love this episode!
00,10the shockwave wiped them out
Oh Scootaloo... :D
Eli: Wait, they didn't even give AJ a Bavarian accent?
Where did it happen? I don't remember.
stfu Rarity. CMC is on the case!
DocSane: enope
Oh, Twi, you always sound so sincere.
COLGATE IS EVERYWHERE
Oh, that reminds me. Sumica, is the winner for the Art Contest up? :o
Derpy!
Dat Colgate infestation!
I wanna see some art!
00,10contest?
So if Derpy is full grown when the Mane 6 were fillys, is Derpy a Grandma?
Lyra is there, but not unicorn.
hello?
wut/
Eli: I'd have thought that would have been the obvious thing to do.
00,10think you are asking the wrong person
Hi Derpy_Hooves
00,10i do streams not art
over 9000 colgates
Derpy is a timelord?
I love their Voices when their kids :)
Morning! o/
pony_4042: Nope. She's a time traveler.
DocSane: well, me too, but what can you do?
MLP is art?
dat G1 Twilight
oh damn
nope
Is that Wildfire?
I mean, she only did it 4 times. Once to rescue Rarity, once in this flashback at groundlevel, once to destroy AJ's barn, and the latest time to celebrate the wedding.
Unicorn Sibsy is judging you
noo
awwww a lil spike
Eli: I don't actually know German, but friends of mine years ago explained the whole "Bavarian = redneck accent" to me.
cliff hanger
Sumica: Oh alright, it was a post on the home page :o
Rarity's dad!
I may be wrong, but Twilight's dad is based on a Gen 1 german only pony toy, right?
pony_4042, possibly
00,10wonder how long before they stop being sticky
:) Because real darts are dangerous
You know if I had a kid that liked those things I would just show him how to play darts.
00,10zomg press dough is back!
Them Lego ponies
eat it
Was Dat Pinkie?
?
where?
There was a Rainbow one too
I saw a rainbow
I'd love to see a playdoh commercial right after this
:( I'm a grown up now? When did that happen?
Mmmm....Playdoh.
yesterday Tovler
Which one was edible again?
/me foams out mouth
Tovler it tends to happen
Barbetos|AtWork: That Hub ad before this that showed lego Pinkie and Rainbow
Sumica, you know what else is back?
Cypresswolf: playdoh.. I hope
Oh no!
00,10gyrobowl?
GODDAMN FURBIES
Oh yes! :3
Eh, kids eat Playdough and Press Dough. Pretty much the same thing.
I should finish my drawing of pearly, I am making her wear a dress and she is all mad about it.. And rarity made it for her but she doesn't like it
you can do it
Agrold: Well it does say non toxic
Tovler: assumedly when you turned 18 or so. If that hasn't happened, ignore said assumptions of being an adult.
Furbies?....oh god :D
The power of Celestia compels you!
Those things....
everything was peaceful
But always remember, growing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional. Acting your age is situational
until the rainbow nation attacked
and then the rainbow nation attacked
rawr
woot woot
rawrteh goes sperk da dergern
Celesta: "Well, that was unexpected..."
