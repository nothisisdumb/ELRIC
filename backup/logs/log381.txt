<CountDoofus> well, if you do it now, it'll be out of your way, but if you haven't had enough rest, it might not be as good as you want it to be
<Fazana> Yep, I would literraly be screwed with a knife and fork if one was set that
<Ragnalock> Saturn, do some of it today rest tomorrow
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01yeah

<Fazana> We do, Wrek runs on spam.
<Ingwaz> dat blood
<Dark_Horst> yeah, we totally need a pony character
<Ingwaz> lol
<ThatsAShinySky> they need a happy wheels client download so we can get skins so we can have santa pony.
<The_4th_Wall> Snakeeeeees: NO.
<The_4th_Wall> just
<Dark_Horst> ....that would be way more awesome than it should be
<The_4th_Wall> no
<Jim> I would not like ponies in this game
<ofna01> why the hell is there random levels in my favorites?
<CCCP> Pinkie Pie needs to be in this game
<ofna01> i only have favorited 1
<Fazana> The death of a pony would be antibrony
<ThatsAShinySky> but optional client with skin capability would be fine
<CCCP> she would not get hurt though
<ofna01> yes
<KwakLad> Having fun Wrek?
<Ingwaz> wow.....

*ThatsAShinySky puts more bits than The_4th_Wall.
<The_4th_Wall> AKA BEST DJ EVER
<Fazana> I don't need bits to win bets :3
<MirrorImage> they're effectively the same if they're both bald
<otakon> I'm back
<KwakLad> ignoring the hair ill accept your point MirrorImage
<Fazana> *Generates 1 million bits out of nowhere*
<otakon> good morning everyone!

<ThatsAShinySky> Hey otakon.
*The_4th_Wall folds, gets a fake id, then bets triple ThatsAShinySky
<otakon> Dark_Horst: that's NOT his style, hes trying something new it seems
*ThatsAShinySky gets more bits that even exist. Take that The_4th_Wall!
<Dark_Horst> you think?
<otakon> oh hell yeah
<Dark_Horst> i'd say it looks quite similar to his other lineworks
<otakon> I can tell by the eyes alone
<CountDoofus> yeah, he said it himself, he tried something new
<CountDoofus> pixal art is what that is
*The_4th_Wall breaks himself, fetches Pinkie.
<CountDoofus> pixel* rather
<ThatsAShinySky> pixel art is good
<ThatsAShinySky> but only good from a distance
<Fazana> Other times, I'm pretty sure he's been doing vector art
<RaveBrony> No lie, a tear just dropped out of my eye.... out of jealousy of Wrek.... :(
<otakon> it's looking really good so far, seems more detailed then his usual stuff
*The_4th_Wall "Pinkie, do your worst"
<CountDoofus> wonder who that green pony is... Myra?
<Fazana> Yeah, pixelart looks really good when in high quality
<Dark_Horst> especially the mane. i like the mane
<CountDoofus> Lyra*

<Aircrafter> Fazana: Big backyard?
<Fazana> Yep
<Aircrafter> Well -squee- :P
<Fazana> If you've not fallen asleep in history, in the medieval times, people would have large strips for farming
<Fazana> like a quarter of a mile long
<derpy_pony> Dark_Horst: asp
<KwakLad> Fazana: and yet you were capable of returning to the house without lighting aids?
<Fazana> I have one of those for a garden
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> He likely knows the way around
<Jim> Lightning aids? Interesting..
<Fazana> I can see the house, but not what I was headed for
<Dark_Horst> ....oh hey, voldemort's in the music biz now?
<Iwubponiez> so much lag :'(
<Fazana> I had to close the scootaloo coop
<Dark_Horst> my interest is awakened

<Jim> eeyup
<Jim> with multiplayer
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> What is torchlight?
<Fazana> One minute
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> and why cant valve count to 3
<Wrek> 05must say pixels are a nice break from vectors >3
<Dark_Horst> what's tochlight?
<otakon> Wrek: I like the new look, very nice
<pony_4080> they can, they just won't yet...
<Jim> It's a dungeon crawler game
<ofna01> looks really good wrek
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> oh
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> okay
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> sounds fun
<Fazana> This is how I feel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWizDna1XO4
<otakon> Torchlight is a Diablo clone done BY the guys that helped make Diablo
<otakon> it's pretty good
<CountDoofus> what's this program called, Wrek? and is it free? :$
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEJwjkm2UPw
<Fazana> It's NOT free
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> its adobe
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> however.
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> WHAT
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> did he move the screen
<otakon> this is the viewfinder for the screen capture program
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> as in
<Sheepy> I'm Guesing Guesing
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> did he delete vinyl, or
<otakon> ThatsAShinySkyALT: probably a new layer
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> ok
<Fazana> Torchlight is amazing
<Fazana> And a sequel would be fab
<otakon> ThatsAShinySkyALT: or his muse has struck him upside the head with a golden brick wrapped around a lemon and he's doing something else. it happenes
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> I WANT BORDERLANDS 2.
<otakon> wait until Sept.
<Observer> Gets boring soon enough, imo
<Jim> the best part of torchlight 2 will be the multiplayer
<Fazana> Y7eah
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> guys, have you noticed, valve cant count to 3?
<Jim> that'll prolong replayability
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> HL2, TF2, and so on
<Sheepy> I'm guessing that wreks streaming
<Fazana> Yeah
<Fazana> I realised years ago
<Jim> Episode 3 anyone?
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> nope
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> never happen
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> they cant count to 3
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> unless
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
<Sheepy> Valve never put a three in any of there games
<Fazana> Also, for every hat you buy, Gabe has the authority to delay Ep3 for another week
<Sheepy> its one of there motto's
<ofna01> speaking of TF2
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lLHy5xv3v8&feature=related
<otakon> okay guys, I'll brb just doing something with Dark Souls
<pony_4080> ThatsAShinySkyALT, Valve said they are releasing Half-Life 3, not Episode 3 though. (Can't remember source though)
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> :/

<Wrek> 05im not talented
<Wrek> 05its called practice
<Wrek> 05you get nowhere iwth out it and dedication
<Jim> You're gooood
<Fazana> The onyl part of Wrek's talent I can muster is his Sniper skills in TF2
<Sheepy> I think that there should be a compition, where the winner gets to have something drawn by @Wrek
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> anyone know any speed stacking?
<Jim> I've seen it once
<Fazana> I can speed stack pancakes
<Sheepy> like once a month or something
<Fazana> I can also speed eat them

<Jim> I've seen people running around like madmen in BF3 with their rocketlaunchers
<CountDoofus> that does it. next paycheck, I'm getting me a drawing tablet, and some instructional books
<ofna01> the semi-auto shotgun
<Aircrafter> Eh, Battlefield look aight
<ofna01> crafter
<Aircrafter> But i'm more of a rpg fallout 3 kinda person.
<ofna01> ah
<Dark_Horst> i swear to god i saw people climbing MOUNTAINS IN TANKS just to get at ONE RED DOT completely surrounded already by blue dots
<ofna01> that explains it
<Fazana> I'm not exactly a fan of the BF and the CoD series
<Dark_Horst> HOW DOES A BRAIN WORK THAT WAY?
<ofna01> i have no clue
<ofna01> im a good jet pilot though
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> so.....who is drawing what?
<ofna01> i went 12-0 with only air-to-air clues
<KwakLad> wrek is drawing
<Dark_Horst> man i missed the jets
<CountDoofus> Wrek is drawing... a pony. who, can't tell yet
<KwakLad> and drawiing a pony
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> neat
<ofna01> poneh
<Fazana> Pwny
<Aircrafter> Who needs any pony other than derpy....
<Dark_Horst> i'd just like to know what they were thinking when they brought back the f35 with the addon and made it utterly worthless
<Observer> Matilda!
<Aircrafter> Derpy is all i need @_@
<ofna01> we need dash Aircrafter
<Aircrafter> True that Ofna01
<Fazana> I would just Snuggle with Rarity
<ofna01> Dark
<Aircrafter> Derpy and Dash
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> and pinkie
<Fazana> That's all I need, and my life will be complete
<ofna01> when did they bring back the F-35?
<Dark_Horst> yes?
<Dark_Horst> in the addon
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> life would be boring without pinkie
<Dark_Horst> back to karkand
<ofna01> ah
<Aircrafter> Derpy, Dash, and Big Macintosh.
<ofna01> i dunno what to have for lunch
<Aircrafter> Eeeyup.
<Fazana> Me and Rarity fit so well
<pony_4080> What do you call a guy who gets destroyed? A. A Pwnee :P
<ofna01> BOOOO
<Dark_Horst> but it's crap. the maneuverabilty and speed in dogfights is a joke. even it's bullets are slower that the mig's
<ofna01> pony_4080 you can change your name with /nick <yourname>
<ofna01> Dark
<Wrek> 05who is this?
<pony_4080> I know, but I'm not a chatter though...
<ofna01> i thought there was no difference?
<Observer> Looks like Matilda to me
<ofna01> its rainbow dash
<Fazana> Wrek, idunnolol
<Dark_Horst> there's a huge difference
<ofna01> its Dasheh
<KwakLad> Berry punch?
<Fazana> It's flutterhsy
<ofna01> NOPE
<Jim> Flutter?
<ofna01> not fluttershy
<Dark_Horst> it's slower that the other jets and steers like a rock
<Aircrafter> Its a pony.
<Jim> mhmm
<CountDoofus> my hunch is Rarity
<Aircrafter> I'm totally sure its a pony.
<Bronyzilla> RD?
<ofna01> rarity,twi,or dash
<KwakLad> Twi?
<Dark_Horst> also you can't break and sharpturn becasue when you hit s it enters hover mode
<Fazana> It's Twilight
<ofna01> i've narrowed it down to those 3
<Iwubponiez> dash
<ofna01> Dark
<Iwubponiez> twi -.-
<CountDoofus> unicorn... so Rarity or Twilight
<ofna01> i play on an Xbox so
*LordCelestia i wonder who will notice this
<Iwubponiez> twilight
<ofna01> its twi
<Fazana> Wait
<Aircrafter> Ofna01: Dat xbox live?
<CountDoofus> unless a background pony
<Fazana> It MIGHT be Twixier
<ofna01> yep
<KwakLad> whos the band?
<Fazana> Trixie*
<Dark_Horst> bf3? on xbox? why you hurt yourself so much?
<ofna01> its either trixie or twi

<LordCelestia> 0,5Because i forgot the tails
<Jim> ohai LC
<Dark_Horst> the console version has way lower graphics, smaller maps and what was the player limit? 24?
<ofna01> Dark,i cant afford a good enough computer to play BF3 on PC
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/LaserPon3-x-Vinyl-Scratch-286538860
<CountDoofus> Laserpon3 and Vinyl?
<LordCelestia> 0,5yep
<unfoundbug> heyhey

<CountDoofus> holy crap, Owl City
<ofna01> OWL CIRY!
<CountDoofus> I love them
<LordCelestia> 0,5A friend
<ofna01> CITY
<ofna01> i remember Fireflys
<Dark_Horst> but 24 < 64. that alone is reaosn enough for the pc verssion, i'd say
<LordCelestia> 0,5Also, here is my tumblr:
<LordCelestia> 0,5http://lordcelestia.tumblr.com/
<Fazana> Who needs bloody CoD or Battlefield when you can play Quake, or Unreal?
<ofna01> i agree Dark
<Iwubponiez> lol derpy day
<Dark_Horst> granted i can't play on high either, but i don't really care. 64 players and all
<ofna01> Dark im actually making a mod to turn all vehicles on BF3 to jets
<Dark_Horst> so flying tanks now?
<unfoundbug> but the jets are so hard to actually fly
<ofna01> no,it replaces them with jets
<Dark_Horst> now they aren't
<ofna01> unfound their not even CLOSE to hard
<Dark_Horst> if they're hard to fly, you have the wrong mosue senitivity
<Dark_Horst> tweak that and everythings cool
<ofna01> try going 18-0 in a jet with only Air-To-Air kills
<unfoundbug> i play on my controller hooked to my pc
<unfoundbug> no mouse sensitivity
<ofna01> so shooting down other jets and helis
<Dark_Horst> what?
<ofna01> Dark
<ofna01> whats your record for dogfights won on BF3?
<ofna01> in a single game
<ofna01> mine was 14
<Dark_Horst> no idea. i'm an occasional pilot
<Fazana> Brb, gonna check if my pancakes are ready for creation yet
<ofna01> then i kiled 4 helis and boosted it up to 18
<Dark_Horst> but my win ratio in jets was 3:1
<Dark_Horst> at leats in the early day. then the veteran pilots came and i learned a whole new appreciation for the ground B)
<ofna01> : )
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> wish i could get any BF.
<ofna01> i got most of my practice on BF play4free
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> like BFBC2
<ofna01> Shiny
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> does it have aircraft?
<ofna01> you ever play Battlefield Play4Free?
<Dark_Horst> no
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> :|
<Dark_Horst> BFBC2 at least not
<ofna01> Play4Free is basically Bad Company 2
<CountDoofus> I'm off for a while, gonna do some more Assassin's Creed
<CountDoofus> ttfn
<ofna01> cya
<Aircrafter> See ya CountDoofus
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> Bye CountDoofus
<Jim> cya CountDoofus
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> Ooh a LoL update! :))
<ofna01> lol
<ofna01> lol @ LoL
<Dark_Horst> but if you want an actual battlefield, i advise you to get something that's not bad company
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> FFS.
<ofna01> Battlefield 2
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> all bad rotatiobn.
<Dark_Horst> bad company was a lot more action balanced than tactics
<Dark_Horst> what really bugged me was that you couldn't lie down
<ofna01> im gonna have to reset my modem real quick
<ofna01> brb
<ofna01> ill be back in 5 minutes
<ofna01> cya for now
<Fazana> I'm back
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> bye
<Fazana> Bloody pancake mix isn't ready
*Fazana rages
<Dark_Horst> that alone took the pacing more into a COD direction
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> why is your pancake mix bloody?
<Fazana> I dunno
<Fazana> Blame mother
<Jim> o_O
<Fazana> But mainly( Bloody = expletive)
<Aircrafter> Well...Guess the chats gonna go quiet for a bit.
<Dark_Horst> i'd guess he's british. bloody seems to be their damn
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> im hungry.
<Bronyzilla> Not really. :P
<Dark_Horst> then teach me wisdom
<unfoundbug> Dark_Horst usually we use damn more than blooduy
<Fazana> I am British
<Bronyzilla> Same.
<Dark_Horst> then why have bloody?
<unfoundbug> bloody*
<Fazana> Most Brits use damn, because they are corrupted by America
<unfoundbug> i use bloody when damn isnt strong enough
<Fazana> In the earlier British times though, people would derp if you said damn
<Jim> Derpy approves
<Dark_Horst> damn < bloody < fucking?
<Fazana> They would be more familiar with "Bloody"
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> I WANT THIS SONG SO BAD
<KwakLad> I use bloody less than damn, less situations that it works
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> SONG NAME
<Fazana> I use it when it makes sense
<Aircrafter> ._.
<Fazana> I rarely use damn
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> whats the song name?
<Fazana> I tend to use bugger
<KwakLad> yeah as do i thats they it works less than damn
<kidzrul434> ThatsAShinySkyALT: use spotify
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> I hjave spotify.
<KwakLad> yeah bugger is a good one
<Dark_Horst> is it just me or does wreks new technique take considerably more time?=
<Wrek> 05hows that?
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> wrek
<Dark_Horst> pretty
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> whats the song?
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> not this one
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> the other one u played
<Wrek> 05i dunno its random
<ThatsAShinySkyALT> :(
<Wrek> 05using spotify radio
<ofna01> i have arrived
<Dark_Horst> and now we shall never know
<Fazana> Don't kill me for this, but for some reason, this picture strikes as suggestive. O_e
<Aircrafter> Dreams crushed, Princess Trollestia Approves.
<ofna01> sorry if i took awhile,i made a sandwhich.
<KwakLad> ofna01's here everyone hide :p
<Dark_Horst> suggestive is not uncommon for wreks pictures
*Jim hides
*ofna01 noms sandwhich and looks around
<ofna01> where is everyone?
<Dark_Horst> here
*Fazana is trying not to laugh
*Jim hops out "Surprise!"
<Aircrafter> I like suggestive, it makes me realize how horrible I am.
*ofna01 chokes on sandwhich
<Fazana> I'm not bothered, but I felt like I had to say it.
<Jim> Think I overdid it?
<pony_4080> Rarity needs a last name... Or a signature with 2 letters.
<Fazana> No, but nothing scares me really
*ofna01 is still choking
<Aircrafter> Jim: Nah he'll be fine....Uh...Ofna o.o
*Aircrafter poking ofna with a stick
*ofna01 takes stick and breaks it,still choking
<KwakLad> liking suggestive isnt something to feel bad about Aircrafter
<Fazana> The only thing that scares me, is something that scares everyone
<KwakLad> well i dont think so
<Jim> Less stick poking more heimlich manevuer
<KwakLad> Fazana: death?
<Aircrafter> Thank you Kwaklad.
<Fazana> No.
<Aircrafter> Taxes?
<Fazana> Nope.
*ofna01 looks at jim with a look that says,"finally someone with a brain"
<Fazana> Think about a certain kid singer.
<Aircrafter> Justin Beaver?
<Fazana> Or he SOUNDS like a kid anyway
*Jim uses the heimlich maneuvre on ofna01
<KwakLad> You are afraid of fridays?
<Jim> Breath darn it
<KwakLad> ohh
*ofna01 spits sandwhich chunk in aircrafters face
<ofna01> oops
<Aircrafter> i dont care about fridays, what happened too thursday?
<Fazana> Thursday is boring
<KwakLad> thursday came after wednesday
*Aircrafter throws it back down Ofna01's throat-
<Fazana> But I'm gonna be bored for quite a while D:
<KwakLad> Why?
*ofna01 looks at Aircrafter with an,"oh you bastard" look
<Fazana> Since I won't be going to my friends for a while
*Aircrafter Troll Face
<KwakLad> How come Fazana ?
*ofna01 slaps the troll face off Aircrafters face
<Fazana> I said yesterday, but not everyone was here, so I'll say it agai
*ofna01 isnt choking anymore
*Aircrafter "Aww...." forever alone face
*ofna01 troll face
*Aircrafter smacks troll face off Ofna01
<Fazana> I got a text yesterday saying that one of my friends has broken his leg in a crash at my mates house in his racing car.
<Orzaidius> hi
<ofna01> dat picture need moar ponys
<KwakLad> Dayum
<ofna01> is he ok Fazana?
<KwakLad> Yeah
<Orzaidius> Who's streaming
<Fazana> I'm not exactly feeling convenient of breaking my legs until any safety measures are made
<KwakLad> Well word is he only broke the leg so im assuming mostly
<ofna01> does any 2 people here actually know each other irl?
<Fazana> Sadly, it's gonna be a mircle if it makes a full recovery
<KwakLad> Ahh
<ofna01> my apologies Faz
<Aircrafter> Fazana: Miracles happen every day. I hope he gets better.
<ofna01> oh i love this song
<KwakLad> but visiting your friend doesnt necesarily mean racing?
<ofna01> like an oceaan
<ofna01> i am no superman
<ofna01> i have no answers for youuu
<Jim> I go...You stay..
*ofna01 wonders why the eye is all black
<Fazana> If he doesn't recover fully, I'm gonna make sure he gets his leg amputated, because quite frankly, I want him to get his arse back in that car
<KwakLad> because its not finished
<ofna01> where do you go,are you looking for answers?
<Orzaidius> can anyone tell me whos streaming
<ofna01> Wrek
<Orzaidius> ahh, thanks
<Orzaidius> lol, also no school on tomorrow and only 5 classes on thursday
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e7N0F4sPQ8
<Fazana> "only"
<Orzaidius> yea
<KwakLad> if a broken leg doesnt heal fully it doesnt mean it is simply unusable Fazana frankly it would be harder to get around with a leg missing than with a duff leg
<Orzaidius> we have 7 usually then
<ofna01> sorry for posting during a stream,but some people dont like drawing
<Fazana> 7? How long?
<Fazana> We have 4 hour long lessons

<Jim> dat A-team theme
<ofna01> whoa you guys have the Thunderbirds?
<Jim> ohai Iwubponiez
*CupcakeWarrior didn't think Swedish people were this cool
<Iwubponiez> random question : why is march 1 derpy day?
<Jim> CupcakeWarrior: You were hugely mistaken
<ofna01> cuz its awesome
<ofna01> IS THAT A B-2 Stealth Bomber?
<DaringDude> whos hostin now
<The_4th_Wall> Oh, yeah, we do a LOT of maintenance and avionic upgrades
<The_4th_Wall> pic page 2? yeah
<The_4th_Wall> recently completed modifications on the aircraft's nozzle bay doors to eliminate cracking.
<ofna01> thats a damn F-22
<ofna01> O_O
<ofna01> most high-tech plane on earth
<The_4th_Wall> One of the most expensive fighters
<ofna01> http://www.hill.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/thumbnails160/051207-F-2673Z-110.jpg
<ofna01> that F-16 seems a little weird..
<ofna01> the angle of the bend of the elevators
<ofna01> seems a little lower then normal F-16's
<Jim> We have F-16's and JAS Gripens at our airbase
<ofna01> Jim,check out the pic,see if anything is weird to you
<CupcakeWarrior> >goes to pony chat
<The_4th_Wall> those little "wings are part of the refuel boom
<CupcakeWarrior> >sees discussion of planes
<ofna01> well,the wings seem like their bent slightly up
<The_4th_Wall> SAAB aircraft? neat
<The_4th_Wall> yeah. that's the boom
<ofna01> not those,the wings on the plane
<The_4th_Wall> oh.
<Bronyzilla> Hi again.
<The_4th_Wall> Stabilators
<Jim> hmm, it doesn't look that strange to me
<ofna01> the actually wings,the ones with flaps and airleons
<The_4th_Wall> pitched for climb
<ofna01> guess its just my imagination
<alexxm> hey guys just got back from college
<Jim> Welcome back alexxm
<The_4th_Wall> trailing or leading edge of the wing?
<ofna01> well,the whole thing
<alexxm> qwho's streaming
<ofna01> it looks like their slightly bent upwards
<The_4th_Wall> boom's plaing trick
<ofna01> its probably just me
<LordCelestia> 0,5What is Wrek drawing?

<Jim> dat F-14
<ofna01> my favorite plane
<ofna01> cant believe the last deployment was 2006
<CrazyBronyDonut> hey everypony
<The_4th_Wall> The F-35's electronic warfare systems are intended to detect hostile aircraft first, which can then be scanned with the electro-optical system and action taken to engage or evade the opponent before the F-35 is detected.[198] The CATbird avionics testbed for the F-35 program has proved capable of detecting and jamming F-22 radars.[204]
<CupcakeWarrior> Crap!
<ofna01> when is the F-35 supposed to go into service?
<CupcakeWarrior> I think I have a stomach flu:(
<ofna01> arent they still developing it?
<The_4th_Wall> F-35 can JAM the F-22 radar
<CrazyBronyDonut> that sucks CupcakeWarrior

<Wrek> 05CupcakeWarrior, nope, cause you get used to it, and you build your society around it.
<Shizuka> 13that whole air current thing in november probably screwed it up for all of us... no snow at the start of the season translating to no snow at the end or something
<Wrek> 05for instance houses are basically cold proof
<Conyst> cold proof all the houses
<DaringDude> poor people in Russia beg to differ

<Flutteryay21> wow awesome
<Jim> CupcakeWarrior: 25 degrees Celsius = 77 degrees Fahrenheit
<Conyst> talking about the weather
<dr-whooves> is he using a table or a mouse?
<dr-whooves> *tablet*
<KwakLad> and what Wrek is saying is why England sucks, similar latitude so we should have similar weather all the time but, gulf stream means warmth, and suddenly english people are idiots and are terrified of snow (when driving) and dont build houses with cold in mind
<otakon> me thinks tablet atm
<KwakLad> sorry bout the wall
<dr-whooves> TABLET OR MOUSE
*Jim shrugpony
<RaveBrony> Tablet
<dr-whooves> what kind?
<RaveBrony> Bamboo -something- i think :o
<CupcakeWarrior> A tablet would be nice to have I guess
<dr-whooves> wacom bamboo gotcha

*ofna01 blows up the shirts
<CupcakeWarrior> no
<ofna01> teehee
<Fazana> Nope, 21-21 (yes, my eyesight is THAT good)
<RainbowDashIsBest> why does the video keep pausing -_
*Jim explodes twice
<RainbowDashIsBest> -_-
<ofna01> JIM
<Dark_Horst> oh US, y u so weird measurements
<KwakLad> I do sometimes Sabatoged
<ofna01> you took 2?
<ekips> contact lenses are awkward, in my opinion
<KwakLad> I do sometimes Saturn
<Fazana> My friend had some catseye ones
<otakon> RainbowDashIsBest: bad connection I suppose
<Fazana> They were creepy D:
<Jim> No, I exploded once from happiness, the once from the bomb
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: what kind?
<RainbowDashIsBest> lol
*CupcakeWarrior thinks US should start using metric system
<Saturn> 08,01have you ever had continuous/extended wear ones?
<otakon> I'm 20-200 left eye, 20-400 right eye as of 2 years ago
<otakon> my vision SUCKS
<ofna01> 20-200?
<Fazana> Doesn't understand
<otakon> yh
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, shinedown
<ofna01> i love this song!
<Jim> I forgot to remove my daily lenses when I went to bed a few times
<KwakLad> Toric Saturn, 6 months lenses
<Fazana> Usually, good eyesight is known as 20-20
<otakon> it means what over people can discern at 200 feet
<KwakLad> unless im misunderstanding
<otakon> I have to be about 20 feet away to make out
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: gas permeable ones?
<Fazana> So, basically, you're long sighted?
<otakon> let me put it this way
<Dark_Horst> so, who wears glasses?
*RainbowDashIsBest is lost in thought*
<otakon> I can't even see the text on my screen at the distance of 3 feet without my glasses
<Conyst> me
<Jim> I wear glasses and sometimes lenses
<KwakLad> never got told that much sorry Saturn
<Fazana> If you counted the time I had to wear 3d glasses in the cinema, yes
<alexxm> i don't
*VioletVanilla raises her hoof
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<otakon> but yh, my eyesight SUCKS
<VioletVanilla> 06only for road driving. . .
*Rain hugs VioletVanilla
<Fazana> Mine's really good
<Dark_Horst> have you met these people that ask to wear your glasses and then say things like "holy shit, you really can't see"?
<VioletVanilla> 06Anything else mein eyesight works well
<Fazana> *Trollface*
<otakon> VioletVanilla: your lucky dear, I have to wear them for everything
<RainbowDashIsBest> hey cool how do you have colord text?
<Shizuka> 13glasses?
<Saturn> 08,01it's just that i have this rash on my nose that is being caused by my glasses
<otakon> Shizuka: yes, glasses
<Saturn> 08,01so i want to wear contacts for a month
<Jim> Only -1 in strength
*Shizuka 13can nicht see two feet in front of her face without them .-.
<Saturn> 08,01but there are so many different kinds...
<otakon> Shizuka: you too?
<Saturn> 08,01does anyone know if it's advisable to have continuous wear ones?
<Fazana> Btw, is it normal that I could see in some 13-12 glasses? Even though I'm 20-20?
<Saturn> 08,01the ones you leave in for 30 days
<otakon> um I don't know Fazana
<RainbowDashIsBest> O)
<Saturn> 08,01and never have to take out until you change them
<Fazana> These hiccups are annoying
<otakon> Saturn: they sell those you know
<KwakLad> Saturn: i see, have you used them before? in the sense of having experiance with them? sometimes it can take a good while for your eyes to get used to them
<otakon> Fazana: drink some water and hold your breath
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: i know; i'm wondering if they're a good idea or not
<Fazana> Already tried it, all other 6 times
<Conyst> I'm effectively blind at 2 feet without my glasses.
<Dark_Horst> i know this guy who had an eye operation and is now more light sensitive than others. he wars quite strong glasses, but boy, he has NIGHT VISION
<Fazana> It didn't work
<otakon> Saturn: well do contacts bother you
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: i've had the ones you take out after 12 hours and dispose monthly before
<alexxm> anyone here think we should worshipQ
<otakon> um no
<Fazana> I had to wait for it to go, before hand, I was literrally ready to yell
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: never had problesm with them
<otakon> we are trying NOT to be seen as a "cult" alexxm
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn needs icecream
<otakon> that would NOT help
<Fazana> My night vision isn't all that good anymore
<KwakLad> Ohhh Saturn no mine were ones that i had to take out each night.. sorry no i guess i cant help them
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: speak for yourself; i'm a cult
<Fazana> Mainly because I stopped eating carrots
<KetaminaDianePie> OMG YEEEAAAAH THIS SONG!!!!
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn needs a pass to candy land XD
<otakon> Saturn: your also pinke haired and Scottish
<KwakLad> Saturn is an entire cult in 1 person
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: thrue.
<Dark_Horst> isn't that carrot thing a myth?
<Fazana> I want candyfloss
<Scavender> Hi everypony
<Fazana> I dunno, ask the mythbusters
<Jim> ohai Scavender
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana: actually, carrots don't help you see in the dark at al
<RainbowDashIsBest> does any one have a pass to candyland for mr. timn
<Conyst> hello Scavender
<otakon> Dark_Horst: no, it's not. Beta Carotene is proven to help improve eyesight but you have to eat a LOT of it to see the effect of it
<RainbowJack> hmm wrek that twilight is so sexy
<Saturn> 08,01it was a myth perpetuated by the british government during WWII to get people to eat more vegetables
<Fazana> Saturn: Not unless you put a firefly inside it :£
<Saturn> 08,01
<otakon> hiya Scavender brb guys need a drink
<Scavender> Faulty internet is faulty
<Jim> Eating too many carrots would make your fat orange though
<Conyst> which means you'll be orange
<alexxm> hey Scavanfer
<Saturn> 08,01but i don't know true
<Saturn> 08,01bugger
<Scavender> Minor snowstorm and pow, no internet for a day
<Dark_Horst> well, i'd think it would help for sharpness but nightvison? you'll ned surgical lasers for that
<Saturn> 08,01Jim: this is actually true
<Fazana> Jim: Um, isn't that blueberry, AND from Willy Wonkas magic (no snorting) factory?
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn will kill you with kill you XD
<Saturn> 08,01and beetroot makes your pee purple
<CupcakeWarrior> yup
<Fazana> Getting stabbed makes knives red :3
<Dark_Horst> carrots have natural red pigments. same reason why flamengos are red. they eat shrimp
<Saturn> 08,01i actually have a rather funny anecdote about beetroot, but it's a bit too dirty for here
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn always loves words with lots of sss's
<Dark_Horst> ...i gotta eat some beetroot sometime
<Fazana> What dirty do you mean, reproductionally dirty or sickly dirty?
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn lives in your garden
<KwakLad> and spinache and rhubarb when eaten in a small time frame can kill you
<Jim> if you eat anything too quickly it would kill you
<RainbowDashIsBest> if i saw mr. timn on this stream tht would be so freaking funny XD
*Fazana is scareed
<CardsLafter> o.o
<Fazana> I ate a treacle pudding in 10 seconds yesterday
<CardsLafter> Come Hither Eyes, Twilight.
<CupcakeWarrior> My body is ready Twilight
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana: a bit of both, actually
<KwakLad> No more in the sense of spinach and rhubarb when combined in a dish or in your stomach form a toxin that is potentially fatal Jim
<RainbowDashIsBest> mr. timn wants to fight you thru a window
<Dark_Horst> and then there'ws that spinache iron bullshit. spinache actually contains barely any iron. the reason we think it's so high is that someone once made a^decimal point mistake while calculating it
<Saturn> 08,01i may be persuaded to tell it in the *other* channel
<Fazana> I know DEFFO kills you
<Jim> Glad I don't eat spinach then
<KwakLad> you mean #other Saturn?
<Fazana> Mentos and Coca cola
<Jim> Popeye learnt me nothing
<otakon> Dark_Horst: but it does have a lot of vitamin !
<otakon> A
<CupcakeWarrior> Spinach is good
<Dark_Horst> oh hit's a healty vegetable nontheless
<VioletVanilla> 06Spoiler Alert: poison does kill, do not drink if you wish to live!
<otakon> I meant to say
<Fazana> Poison doesn't kill
<RainbowDashIsBest> R.I.P mr. timn ????-2012
*otakon hugs VioletVanilla "You are SUCH a silly filly!"
*Fazana takes a HUUUUGE swag from cyanide
<VioletVanilla> 06D:
<Dark_Horst> still the only spinache i eat is on my pizza
<Saturn> 08,01KwakLad: *cough*#stupidsexytwilight*cough*
<Fazana> See, I'm al*drops dead*
<VioletVanilla> 06Fazana neeeeiiiiinnnn!
<Fazana> Hehehe, I'm not really dead
<alexxm> puts poisin in town water supplies
<otakon> he's fine
<Fazana> I just got KOed
<otakon> Somebody poisoned the water hole!
<Fazana> Good thing I'm immune to plain cynaide eh?
<CountDoofus> hawt dang, Twilight's looking goooooooood
<Dark_Horst> well played saturn
<SonicRainBoomScout> yo
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i'm about to tell the story if you want to come back
<otakon> agreed this looks REALLY good

<ThatsAShinySky> I sound dumb, but what is inb4
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 someone clops to this
<dr-whooves> ^
<Fazana> inb4 that's a retarded statement to be blunt
<CountDoofus> yeah I know In Before, but not the context in when to use it
<Bronyzilla> You inb4 to stop people achieving the obvious and inevitable.
*RainbowDashIsBest is bored
<Fazana> Right
<Kammerjunk> It means that you are "in" before X happened. X is usually something that'd obviously happen.
<AwsomeNick> brb everypony bout 20 mins

<Fazana> Never gonna give you up!
<CrazyBronyDonut> some bronies are furries though
<SonicRainBoomScout> furries are too obessed with yiff and all of dat shit
<RainbowDashIsBest> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBzfJF3C0CI
<Tovler|LENT> are we supposed to hate that song.
<dr-whooves> this^
<RainbowDashIsBest> dude
<RainbowDashIsBest> dont be a ahta
<CrazyBronyDonut> i dont have a problem with that
<Kammerjunk> Sethisto is both, isn't he?
<RainbowDashIsBest> hata*
<KetaminaDianePie> where is this song from? is that some sonic?
<dr-whooves> THE GAME
<Fazana> I don't mind furries, it's just when it gets all dirty.
<RoflBot> anyone play starcraft 2?
<SonicRainBoomScout> yeah.....
<Tovler|LENT> I need to invite more furries here.
<dr-whooves> THE GAME
<SonicRainBoomScout> Lol
<Fazana> You lost it.
<karmathewolfie> I'm a brony and a furry AND PROUD DANGIT!
<RaveBrony> Yeah, furries are fine in my book...but its just the ones that Actually Have the fetish is when i draw thwe line :\
<SonicRainBoomScout> But....sometimes.....furries...send me...pics
<CupcakeWarrior> lol furries
<Fazana> I'm a closet brony.
<KetaminaDianePie> but furries are bad
<RoflBot> its either bronys or furries..
<SonicRainBoomScout> when they send me those pics
<Kammerjunk> I generally like the artstyle I see furries use. It has a certain je ne said quoi to it.
<CupcakeWarrior> brony>furry
<SonicRainBoomScout> i..am disturbed..
<RaveBrony> ^
<Fazana> I have to call spike to use fire
<MirrorImage> KetaminaDianePie - by all technicality, *we* are furries as well
<AndroUser2> It's me ThatsAShinySky.
<AndroUser2> Srsly.
<RoflBot> not really
<SonicRainBoomScout> Its disturbing imagery
<RainbowDashIsBest> furries arent bad
<RaveBrony> This is true.....ponies are animals.... but
<Kammerjunk> je ne sais quoi*
<Fazana> Ponies- hairy creatures
<RaveBrony> Meh, idk
<Kammerjunk> SonicRainBoomScout: Subjectively.
<CupcakeWarrior> furry=anthro
<Fazana> Humans are animals
<MirrorImage> though i guess it really comes down to how you define "furry"
<RaveBrony> ^
<MirrorImage> similarly, how would you define "brony" when defending it
<Tovler|LENT> I don't even know what qualifies as a furry.
<MirrorImage> some people think "brony" refers to R34 and the like
<Eye> What do you care about people's sexual interests as long as they don't harm others? :u
<OneTrickPony> This looks so good
<Fazana> Someone not in the correct target audience for a show.
<RaveBrony> Furry - attraction to animals/ Brony - attraction to the show?
<RoflBot> ya
<Fazana> Eye, sometimes it takes over and they never shut up about it
<Kammerjunk> MirrorImage: Quite. Myself, I like the furry artstyle I see used a lot, but not the porn.
<SonicRainBoomScout> I define furries...as...people who like animals with human charasictics
<CupcakeWarrior> furry artists draw anthro
<SonicRainBoomScout> and are sex obedient..
<DaringDude> Yes the book
<Fazana> All my friends like CoD, and sometimes, I just want to spear them all
<Tovler|LENT> wait, no. that's zoophilia. not furry
<RaveBrony> ^
<Fazana> That's personification? no?
<dr-whooves> anypony watch SHed.mov?
<KetaminaDianePie> i was being sarcastic MirrorImage
<SonicRainBoomScout> TF2>COD
<dr-whooves> ^
<KwakLad> Tovler|LENT: what are you giving up?
<Aircrafter> DR-WHOOVES

*CupcakeWarrior goes into THE SHED
<Jim> dr-whooves: We are not supposed to talk about that here
<Fazana> I gotta be honest
<Aircrafter> YOU will NOT mention that here.
<MirrorImage> Kammerjunk - so no J Naylor?
<DaringDude> OHH ya Fluttershy stare against princess molestia go fluttershy go
<Kammerjunk> It's a shame I can't find much furry art without nudity.

<RaveBrony> I actually appreciate furry art (the clean stuff) most of it is really cool O.o
<CupcakeWarrior> Shed was hilarious
<Jim> We don't talk about the .movs here, not leave it.
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Exactly.
<Fazana> Unreal Tournament: I'd say it's better than TF2
<SonicRainBoomScout> But the non-cleaners..........
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Please don't discuss shed.mov here
<dr-whooves> ok i wont but why?
<Fazana> But quake 3 is better than TF2
<SonicRainBoomScout> -shivers-
<KwakLad> dr-whooves: no we dont talk about it
<RoflBot> why?
<Fazana> Because we try to keep 13+
<CrazyBronyDonut> ITS JUST HOW IT IS!
<RaveBrony> Becuz its disturbing to some viewers
<Kammerjunk> PG13, yes.
<Fazana> The .mov's are explicibally 18+
<dr-whooves> okey dokey lokey

<CupcakeWarrior> The eyelashes are sexy
<dr-whooves> have you guys heard thorins song yet?
<Dark_Horst> they look a bit too dense actually

<flutter_spin> I guess I never liked long eyelashes on ... anyone
<Kammerjunk> I never cared about that sort of thing, being a guy.
<dr-whooves> they work on twilight
<Aircrafter> That. Looks. EPIC.
<Jim> different tastes I suppose
<dr-whooves> Who wants to play pokemon?
<KetaminaDianePie> me
<dr-whooves> Go VENASAUR
<AndroUser2> Anyone seen f1uttershy?
<Kammerjunk> Let me rephrase, being concerns for looks.
*CupcakeWarrior imagines Twilight dressed up as Bayonetta
<Kammerjunk> being without*
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: Gee, thanks for putting that picture in my head.
<dr-whooves> USE WRAP
<Kammerjunk> I did not need that.
<Dark_Horst> cupcake, let's not go there
<Jim> Bayonetta isn't known to dress up...well...classy.
<flutter_spin> I definitely admire the glasses. Nice work on them
<KwakLad> Jim i think thats why he suggested it :p

<Kammerjunk> RainbowJack: It's an Undead joke from WoW.
<CountDoofus> I'm tempted to make this my new background
<kidzrul434> Is anypony listening to me?
<CupcakeWarrior> Is that wierd that this picture is hotter than most human women?
<RainbowJack> Kammerjunk : eeyup
<Rain> ekips sush you
<Kammerjunk> Granted, my background is 1920x1600, but I can work with this.
<flutter_spin> I guess the eyelashes are fine. The rest is cool
<Kammerjunk> my monitors are*
<ekips> "The Artist has requested Critique on this Artwork" to Rain
<CountDoofus> kidzrul434: yes. what'd you do that brought you down so much?

*Midnight_Tempest curls up on the couch, under a blanket

<Wrek> 05eyes, check. anatomy, check. hair, almost check. magi effects, needs work.
<Kammerjunk> SonicRainBoomScout: Oh gee golly whiz, that's a hard question. Let me just dig my backlog up.
<SonicRainBoomScout> Mine is either cupcakes or priness molestia..
<AndroUser2> Can't remember JKs, but deaf stallion makes out with vinyl scratch.
<dr-whooves> Magic around the base needs work
<unfoundbug> what on earth is wrong with that hair??
<Rain> Wrek this looks awesome, just letting you know
*Fazana is back
<Kammerjunk> Probably "Imposition" or "Calling the Shots".
<CountDoofus> SonicRainBoomScout: is that question limited to MLP only?
<dr-whooves> Somone shipped Applejack_Cherille
<Fazana> Just watched the Borderlands 2 trailer
<AndroUser2> Wb
<SonicRainBoomScout> yeah..
<flutter_spin> quiet! Nothing wrong with her.. I mean her eyes.. I mean... ugh
<Jim> Fazana: There is a trailer now? :o
<CrazyBronyDonut> strangest ship imo is TwiDash
<unfoundbug> those eyes are hypnotic
<Fazana> Alright, so it looks slightly suggestive. It's still really good art
<OneTrickPony> #3
<Fazana> YTeah, there's a trailer
<Kammerjunk> Look into Twilight's eyes. Lose yourself in their depth.
<Midnight_Tempest> gorillaz YAY!

<CrazyBronyDonut> Gorillaz
<The_4th_Wall> Wrek, it's GORGEOUS. I want one in my room
<KetaminaDianePie> OWWW YEAH I LOVE GORILLAZ!
<dr-whooves> Brace yourself, clopfics are coming from this pic
<Dark_Horst> i'm still thinking a bit more air iin those eyelashes would be an upgrade. but that's just, like, my opinion man
<AndroUser2> I can't see or listen to it :(
<flutter_spin> ^^ Gorillaz
<Midnight_Tempest> 19-2000 <3 this song
<Kammerjunk> Fazana: Try going to Wrek's dA page, then tell me this is suggestive.
<CountDoofus> The_4th_Wall: ikr? if this was for sale, I'd buy it in a heartbeat
<CupcakeWarrior> To think, when I first came on the chat, the drawing was just a creepy eye
<The_4th_Wall> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWJUSulnro&feature=youtu.be
<The_4th_Wall> BL@
<The_4th_Wall> BL2
<CountDoofus> Dee doo da bop
<unfoundbug> hang on, omg he customised the signature!
<Fazana> Which is why I put "slightly"
<Kammerjunk> Fair enough.
<Fazana> I've also realised he has "That" soldier
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, this isn't anywhere near suggestive :)
<Fazana> for his avatar
<KwakLad> Wrek still drawing or just letting us see the pic now?
<Fazana> pootsets
<AndroUser2> Im gonna try a horrible attempt at tablet drawing after school tomorrow.
<Wrek> 05goan take a break than draw anotehr image. the twi one is up on my DA
<Kammerjunk> I tried to draw with the Wacom Bamboo tablet I have.
<Kammerjunk> Then I gave up.
<AndroUser2> Okay :D

<RainbowJack> where is Saturn?
<dr-whooves> Want a bamboo but im poor
<flutter_spin> http://veggie55.deviantart.com/gallery/33525968?offset=0#/d4plrca
<CountDoofus> her look might be a tad seductive, but I'm okay with that
<Dark_Horst> interesting... gema locked the borderlands 2 launchdate trailer. becasue of musik. so now i can't watch an advertising becasue the music in it is copyrighted
<Kammerjunk> dr-whooves: Get one with a screen. I have one without, it's shite.
<dr-whooves> IM POOR
<CupcakeWarrior> http://johntb.deviantart.com/#/d4qmkg2
<Kammerjunk> When you can get one, do so.
<Dark_Horst> corporatetube, are you fucking kidding me?
<Kammerjunk> What've they done now?
<AndroUser2> I get
*CupcakeWarrior saves as desktop background
<AndroUser2> £5 a week, how much is a bamboo?
<Dark_Horst> interesting... gema locked the borderlands 2 launchdate trailer. becasue of musik. so now i can't watch an advertising becasue the music in it is copyrighted
<Kammerjunk> AndroUser2: Not a clue, I'm Danish.
<Dark_Horst> that
<Dark_Horst> they did THAT
<Fazana> Why does the pic remind me of skyrim sparkle? By Veggie55 I think
<RaveBrony> o.o
<KetaminaDianePie> feel good..........
<AndroUser2> To eBay! What's the bamboo full name?
<CupcakeWarrior> This song sounds familiar
<flutter_spin> MOAR Gorillaz :P
<Fazana> I've just realised my stream stops
<Midnight_Tempest> well... that Borderlands 2 trailer made me soil myself in joy... that shouldn't happen .__.
<Fazana> Thought it was Gorillaz
<Dark_Horst> feel good inc by gorillaz. mtv spammed that one up and down to no end
<Kammerjunk> I would use so much pony for my desktops, but both my monitors are 1920x1200, and most wallpapers are made in 1920x1280.
<Jim> Same :D
<CountDoofus> just out of curiosity Wrek (and sorry if I'm annoying you), but howlong have you been drawing in order to get this good?
<Kammerjunk> feelsbadman.jpg
<Dark_Horst> that's why you remember it
*Fazana hugs Kammerjunk to make him/her (sorry :P) feel better
<Dark_Horst> he's been drawing about 4 hours
<The_4th_Wall> 8 min, 7 faves. nice
<flutter_spin> The music video was aired during the Toonami Midnight Run
<Dark_Horst> maybe more

<flutter_spin> Guild Wars 2 beta signup is going on right now
<Fazana> Torchlight 2 is gonna be absolutely awesome
<Kammerjunk> I want to buy Diablo III and that's basically it.
<Fazana> GW2 engi looks pretty cool
<Kammerjunk> I don't buy a lot of games.
<Dark_Horst> flutterspin, link?
<flutter_spin> eh. I played Diablo 3 beta, but I didn't care for it

<flutter_spin> https://beta.guildwars2.com/
<Fazana> I've been playing that game all my life
<Kammerjunk> AndroUser2: Does it have a screen?
<CountDoofus> I'd love to be this good at drawing, but my patience usually runs out before I can get a decent stroke down
<Dark_Horst> thanks
<flutter_spin> No. Diablo 3 is still tweaking... for the worse
<dr-whooves> www.ponyspin.com
<AndroUser2> LOOKS LIKE IT. caps odd
<Kammerjunk> I'd recommend getting one with a screen instead of just a pad.

<mario_pony> StinkomanFan: sawdust
<dr-whooves> Combat is fun man
<Paradise92> Midnight_Tempest i know...but i call this gay gorilaz :(
<Midnight_Tempest> shame, i like this album
<flutter_spin> It is why I'm weird. I don't like that fast pace combat.
<flutter_spin> It is why I don't like TF2
<Fazana> I love fact paced combat
<Fazana> That's why I love Quake
<CupcakeWarrior> fact paced
<Midnight_Tempest> fact paced eh... dem facts
<Fazana> Fast pace, bloody hell
<dr-whooves> doom1>allCoD combined
<mario_pony> lol
<Jim> Portal is fact based combat
<dr-whooves> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> true
<Paradise92> you can play Quake as much as you f-ing want and still it won't be boring
<Fazana> Yeah
<flutter_spin> I loved Unreal Tournament 2004 because of Onslaught with the vehicles. Didn't like the tournament-style
<dr-whooves> I have never played fallout, is it good?
<Fazana> Gotta love Quake 3
<Jim> Fallout is great

<Fazana> I kinda Hate MC now
<CupcakeWarrior> Quid is a silly sounding word
<dr-whooves> ^
<mario_pony> Fazana: why?
<Fazana> The food system is stupid
<AndroUser2> Squid is better.
<Fazana> Sicksquid
<unfoundbug> CupcakeWarrior it gets less silly the more you actually use it in conversation
<dr-whooves> I like twiddle
<AndroUser2> I have 30 squid
<CountDoofus> kumquat
<dr-whooves> chimmycherry or cherrychanga?

<CountDoofus> Colin Mochrie: "THE CAT!"
*mario_pony summons snorlax
<Fazana> I'd rather snuggle with Rarity

<Kammerjunk> On a somewhat related note, that letter the Felicia gal sent to Daniel Ingram is brilliant.
*CupcakeWarrior house doesnt allow pets
<CupcakeWarrior> :(

<String_Shredder> TwiMac
<unfoundbug> also, wasnt there something about not talking about shipping?
<Fazana> Anyway
<unfoundbug> or did i imagine that
<flutter_spin> It is why I haven't really played Bioshock. I'm alone. It isn't fun unless there are people around to laugh as I freak out.

<Rain> hello Phase4 ^_^
<Jim> a level 100 Arcanine
<CountDoofus> there was a time I could name the first 150 pokémon by name and number

<dr-whooves> I'll be damned if abra wasn't rage inducing as cuss
<OneTrickPony> make a landscape space drawing:)
<Phase4> ohai LordCelestia
<Kammerjunk> I think there should be more MLP/Portal crossovers.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi~ how is everyone today?
<flutter_spin> I think my issue isn't being able to be good at something. I think it is the motivation in doing it. If no one wants me to do it, then why should I bother pouring my sweat and tears into it?
<ekips> I'd like to Aribeth as a pony
<mario_pony> i think there should be a super mario/pony crossover game
<CupcakeWarrior> There should be a pony/earth crossover
<CountDoofus> hello there TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Kammerjunk> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Heus. Tired, but happy.
<mario_pony> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<unfoundbug> CupcakeWarrior, you used the wrong word, replacement, not crossover
<Jim> ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<CupcakeWarrior> My bad
<Phase4> flutter_spin: do you want to do it?
<Phase4> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<flutter_spin> I have no "want".
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT hugs everyone
<CountDoofus> flutter_spin: I know what you mean. in my case, if I don't get recognition, why bother in the first place
<Kammerjunk> CupcakeWarrior: You mean like the million Human in Equestria fics?
<CupcakeWarrior> I meant irl
<CupcakeWarrior> Ponies invading us
<Phase4> flutter_spin: not sure what you meen
<Kammerjunk> And that's why I keep telling you ponies to become quantum scientists.
<flutter_spin> brb. bro calling
<Kammerjunk> We need that portal to Equestria
<Kammerjunk> !*
<MirrorImage> CupcakeWarrior - so you mean like the MAD TV thing?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just came back from wal-mart, there was a pinklestia right there but i was short on money D:

<Jim> "I'll give you all my money and a shoe lace"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hahaha
<CupcakeWarrior> What kind of unholy being buy Pinklestia?
<MirrorImage> "How much money are we talking here, Jim?"
<ekips> RAWR

<Jim> about three fiddy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it*
<MirrorImage> SOLD
<TrixieMuffin> Hey Walmart guy , look at my shirt , now look at this , clearly offcolor , defective , give me half off!
<CupcakeWarrior> I guess you could always paint Pinklestia white
<CountDoofus> "Dear McGyver. Enclosed is a paper clip, a rubber band and a drinking straw. Please save our dog."
<mario_pony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: you should of chosen pinklestia
<Kammerjunk> Hey guys. Try taking a CLOSE look at Celestia in FiM.
<Kammerjunk> YFW you notice that Celestia has a pink hue.
<Dark_Horst> FUCK THAT PINK HUE
<Conyst> He would only need the paperclip
<CupcakeWarrior> Not entirely pink
<Wrek> 05calm yourself
<CCCP> Hello Fillies and Gentlecolts
<Dark_Horst> it's as good as nonexistant, whitelestia is canon, drop it
<Jim> ohai CCCP
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i was going too but that was not my money, i was shooping for my mom and i didn't bring my money with me so..
<CCCP> hi Jim

<Kammerjunk> Oh no, her actual coat.
<Paradise92> lol
<KwakLad> Wait Wrek this is Ratatat right?
<kirz> 1,3the outlines are a direct component of their color scheme
<Phase4> hi kirz
<Paradise92> i thought it was
<Paradise92> my fb message
<Wrek> 05yeah

<Dark_Horst> with a spoon
<Wrek> 05wildcat

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kammerjunk: ahh i did that lol
<Kammerjunk> mario_pony: Oh, you slowpoke.
<alexxm> night Jim
<Dark_Horst> it's not a matter of balls for me, the problem is that hasbro just won't sell FIM stuff in germany
<Phase4> night Jim
<mario_pony> hi alexxm
<Rain> kirz I need pony merch before I need to clean out a space for it >.<
<Dark_Horst> and the few FIM articles they DO is are the crap ones
<CupcakeWarrior> My mom would kill me if she saw ponies in my room
<ekips> I know that feel Dark_Horst
<Rain> CupcakeWarrior do it!
<CCCP> Why does every one i know excpet like 2 friend of mine hate ponies?
<Rain> not that I want you to get killed or anything but just to show her who is boss
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CupcakeWarrior: you can always tell your mom that it was a gift from a friend :p
<Rain> are you a boss CupcakeWarrior? ARE YOU?
<otakon> CCCP: bc they are close minded fools
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Because they can't remove the idea of how the old shows are.
<Dark_Horst> cccp i feel your pain
<Kammerjunk> Also what otakon said.
<ekips> wait, wrek is drawing another one?!
<CCCP> otakon: yes they are it is impossible to talkl to the m about it.
<Dark_Horst> and the two i actually tried to assimilate never quite caught on
<PartyCannon> CCCP it's a shame
<KwakLad> Yup ekips
<CupcakeWarrior> I hope he doesnt give himself carpal tunnet
<Phase4> whats this song?
<CountDoofus> oh what, another one? oh hell no, getting late and my fanfic will never get done at this rate
<Kammerjunk> My friends know, and they've accepted it by now. They still think I'm odd, though.
<CountDoofus> goodnight everypony
<Kammerjunk> Then again, they thought so before, too.
*CCCP hugs Dark_Horst
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, CountDoofus.
<ekips> O_o
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night CountDoofus
<Phase4> night CountDoofus
*CupcakeWarrior has Aspergers so everyone thinks he is odd
<CCCP> night CountDoofus
*Dark_Horst hugs bag
<Dark_Horst> may the future hold better targets
<CCCP> bag?
<Kammerjunk> Wrek should totally draw the oversized jars of jelly pony one day.
<Dark_Horst> ...lol, bag
<CCCP> lol
<Dark_Horst> i'm tired
<CupcakeWarrior> Does the jelly pony have a name yet?
<Conyst> gotta go for now bye
<Kammerjunk> Not sure.
<Phase4> later Conyst
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Conyst.
<CCCP> bye Conyst
<Wrek> 05gotta replace the tip of my pen
<Dark_Horst> pen?
<Wrek> 05thats the 6th tip this month
<Dark_Horst> what pen?
<Kammerjunk> I thought you drew with your mouse.
<KwakLad> There needs to be a Piccard pony if there isnt one... or a picture of all the Startrek captains ponyfied
<CupcakeWarrior> stylus
<kirz> 1,3impressive Wrek
<Wrek> 05the pen i use for my drawpad
<CupcakeWarrior> Wrek: is this pc or tablet?
<kirz> 1,3pixel art = drawpad, vectors = mouse
<Phase4> if what we call jam you call jelly, what do you call jelly?
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: You when you see my Pinkie Pie shirt.
<Dark_Horst> so, how do you draw exactly? mouse draw pad combo?
<KwakLad> i want a trackball mouse, can be so much more precise with one
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: ?
<Dark_Horst> or do your toools have certain jobs?
<flutter_spin> ok I'm back
<Kammerjunk> You asked what I called jelly.
<flutter_spin> My bro was talking about Castle crashers and the development on Battleblock Theatre
<Phase4> Kammerjunk: xD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so why there is not a pony named pete, every pony seems to talk about him :p
<Phase4> well played
<Kammerjunk> I swear, those shirts cost a fortune to ship to Denmark.
<kirz> 1,3depends on what he's going with for the picture, sketch/painting types are easier to do with a drawpad, vectors are easier with a mouse
<Kammerjunk> Thank you, good sir.
<Dark_Horst> HOLY SHIT, it's gregorian
<Kammerjunk> I get the feeling this is a crossover pony.
<Paradise92> And nothing else maters!
<flutter_spin> When I said I don't have any want, I mean that I'm like Pinkie Pie. I try to have fun with people. When I don't have any friends, which is the case right now, what do I do?
<Dark_Horst> these guys are awesome
<Paradise92> METALICAAAAA
<Phase4> "In the United States and Canada, gelatin desserts are called jello (a generic name based on the brand name Jell-O) or gelatin, whereas 'jelly' is a fruit preserve."
<CupcakeWarrior> Are there tutorials for making vectors?
<Kammerjunk> flutter_spin: You pony.
<Phase4> the more you know
<Kammerjunk> You pony the hay out.
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw this is a Metallica cover
<kirz> 1,3there are a lot out there CupcakeWarrior, just have to look around
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the more you think ignorance is bliss ?
<Dark_Horst> Kammerjunk: ikr?
<kirz> 1,3some on DA I know
<Kammerjunk> The more you know, the less you don't.
<Dark_Horst> the band's gregorian, they do covers of popular songs with gregorian singing
<flutter_spin> I have music I have yet to listen to, I have games I haven't played, I have stuff around the house I could do...
<Kammerjunk> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^^
<Dark_Horst> you should hear their hells bells cover
<flutter_spin> But my mom sort of suspends anything I do. She doesn't like me paying bills, getting the mail, or taking out the trash.
<Kammerjunk> I have around 15 GB of music because I download everything an artist made when I want to listen to 5 songs.
<flutter_spin> Don't ask me why. I've tried to figure it out. She wants to be in control
<CupcakeWarrior> All my music goes to my ps3
<Kammerjunk> flutter_spin: Not even taking out the trash=
<Kammerjunk> ?*
<flutter_spin> No. She complains that the trash isn't full enough. So she does it herself.
<Kammerjunk> ._.
<CupcakeWarrior> Is anyone even watching the drawing?
<CCCP> i will delet teh internets from teh worlds.
<Kammerjunk> I am.
<CCCP> i am
<flutter_spin> She is a hoarder at heart. She will deny me the right to throw away my own trash unless she knows it isn't anything 'of value'
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: do you have The Dark Side Of The Chant?
<ekips> from time to time i am
<Phase4> ^
<Wrek> 05i got spotify
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm watching CupcakeWarrior i'm always watching
<Wrek> 05which mean i have all their albums
<CCCP> its cool it looks like over time the picture is coming to life.
<kirz> 1,3I'm always watching too ;)
<Kammerjunk> I want to read fics and play games and watch the stream and read a book, BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALL.
<unfoundbug> i used to like spotify
<unfoundbug> then i took liscence issues to the music collection
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yay~ lurking FTW!
<unfoundbug> :(
<Kammerjunk> I never used Spotify.
<unfoundbug> a playlist of over 200 down to 15
<CupcakeWarrior> I only use Pandora
<Vinyl> Spotify is awesome~
<Kammerjunk> Because I'd just end up downloading it to get it on my iPhone anyway.
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: if you put your mind to it you can do anything!
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: But not at the same time!
<Wrek> 05now this is BA music
<Kammerjunk> I need 4 consciences!
<Terok> fantastic music <3
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: i have 3 u can borrow 1 from me
<KwakLad> Is this that Caravan Palace again?
<Vinyl> Ooo~ What is this?~ Sounds like Caravan palace~
<Kammerjunk> I still won't have 4 consiences! Well, unless you count the voices in my head, but I don't.
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, wings
<Kammerjunk> They sound like Fluttershy and Twilight.
<Kammerjunk> And they make me not be lazy.
<CCCP> I have pinkie pie in my head i think
<KwakLad> What? a smoking pony? or is it a pancil?
<CCCP> That how cancer is in Equestria!
<Kammerjunk> YFW it's a sonic screwdriver.
<Dark_Horst> where?
<Kammerjunk> I don't think it is.
<Dark_Horst> the stick in the pony's mouth?
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Pocky~
<CCCP> its a pen
<Kammerjunk> Could be a cigarette.
<CupcakeWarrior> What pony is this?
<Kammerjunk> I'm thinking a crossover with something.
<Kammerjunk> You know, like Wrek's Syndicate crossover picture.
<Dark_Horst> i'd say it's a tobaco containing device
<CCCP> Ponies should know smoking is bad
<Dark_Horst> oh gun
<Dark_Horst> i'll say more syndicate
<ekips> ponies with guns :(
<Dark_Horst> probabyl another dash picture
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Havoc is that you ?
<flutter_spin> I currently see a shiny Fluttershy with FF Weapon
<flutter_spin> with wings of gold
<Daring> Is wrek still drawing?
<kirz> 1,3Wrek is always drawing
<Daring> true
<Dark_Horst> wrek's dedication to his art is amazing, isn't it?
<KwakLad> no he sleeps and plays TF2 :p
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst: Obsession*
<Dark_Horst> or that
<unfoundbug> he plays marathon a fair bit
<Daring> and hes damn good at sniping in tf2
<CupcakeWarrior> Is this a TF2 crossover?
<Kammerjunk> I wouldn't think so.
<KwakLad> it might be another syn based pony?
<Kammerjunk> Dark_Horst said Syndicate before, could be.
<Kipkat07> hi everypony

<Kipkat07> i have an idea for a PMV parody of Not Afraid by Eminem called "Not Afraid to be a Brony". How does it sound?
<KwakLad> mario_pony: a graphics programme i guess
<Kammerjunk> Kipkat07: I say go for it.
<KwakLad> considering we are watching it

<Everlasting_Joy> Take care CupcakeWarrior.
<ekips> no offense, but did you mean bronytis?
<CountDoofus> because the fic I have in mind is a sad one, and I want it accompanied by something I've drawn. Fluttershy probably won't be one crying, but she was the first one that came to mind
<DaringDude> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2179/
<Theoboldi> I think I might be going to hell for this
<CCCP> CountDoofus: make it as sad as MLD
<mario_pony> fucking hicups
*Tovler|LENT points and laughs
<Theoboldi> worth it
<kidzrul434> that means I need an inhalers
<Meanwhile> MLD was boring.
<Kipkat07> i had that then i had pnumonia than i had mono
<CCCP> Meanwhile: no
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: It was a bit boring I admit
<Meanwhile> CCCP: Eeyup.

<CCCP> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Vinyl> I cried on MLD, but I liked Allegrezza better
<CCCP> NO
<mario_pony> no
<DaringDude> NO
<RaveBrony> dat spam
<TOY_PON3> YES! no all caps :|
<Meanwhile> Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup.
<Kammerjunk> VioletVanilla: C-C-C-C-COMBOBREAKER
<Tovler|LENT> MLD? Major League… Daseball?
<CountDoofus> eh... MLD did nothing for me. it felt like the author was trying too hard to make me cry
<Kammerjunk> goddammittabkey
<Meanwhile> Dat daseball.
<Kammerjunk> I meant Vinyl.
<Wrek> 05hmm
<CountDoofus> Tovler|LENT: My Little Dashie, a sad fanfic
<TOY_PON3> dat tab fail
<RaveBrony> I have yet to read MLD, tomorrow i shall :)
<KwakLad> Sweet pegasis
<Vinyl> Wait, I just broke that combo? I win!
<DaringDude> You can listen to someone reading it if you get bored reading
<TOY_PON3> RaveBrony: It's not as sad as everypony says it is
<RaveBrony> :o
*Wrek 's head jammed
<CountDoofus> I found "Simply Rarity" a lot sadder
<RaveBrony> Whats wrong Wrek?
<Theoboldi> am I the only person in the whole world who has no intention of ever reading MLD?
<Zappy> ...Wrek...you okay?
<TOY_PON3> Okay I shed a tear or two to it but that's it. I wasn't bawling my eyes out
<Pegasister16> CountDoofus: Simple Rarity?
<Wrek> 05im ok but
<Meanwhile> Theoboldi: ofc not, you're never the only one of anything. Ever.
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Midnight_Fyre> Agreed, CountDoofus. Actually, I found a number of stories sadder
<Wrek> 05dunno if i am to continue on this one
<TOY_PON3> Hmm
<RaveBrony> Hmmm
<CCCP> oops
<Vinyl> mhm
<TOY_PON3> Wrek: You don't have to if you don't want to
<RaveBrony> ^
<Theoboldi> So there is another me? 6_9
<CCCP> why did i get kicked?
<Midnight_Fyre> And why is it that not a single day can pass by without a MLD discussion?
<[SWAG]thehated5689> HEYO bronies :D
<Zappy> Wrek: it's cool. The pic is awesome the way it is now.
<TOY_PON3> CCCP: spam
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> spam ?
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: Daribot.
<PartyCannon> Wrek whatever the artistic mind says~~
<TOY_PON3> ^
<CCCP> :\
<Vinyl> Ooo! 'The white box' 6-star story, I know what I'm reading tonight
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hi~ [SWAG]thehated5689
<[SWAG]thehated5689> and damn thats a good drawing
<CCCP> But MLD is not boring
<CCCP> imo
<DaringDude> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1347/
<Meanwhile> It is.
<TOY_PON3> CCCP: It is believe me
<Midnight_Fyre> No, it at least keeps your interest
<Meanwhile> Your opinion is wrong!
<TOY_PON3> It dragged on
*Vinyl hugs DaringDude
<DaringDude> Im siding with CCCP
<CountDoofus> Pegasister16: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7099507/1/ Simply Rarity
<CCCP> :)
<Kammerjunk> Whether or not My Little Dashie is boring is purely subjective.
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: What made it boring to you just asking
<Kammerjunk> Thus, there is no definitive answer.
<DaringDude> :) Vinyl
<Vinyl> c:
<Midnight_Fyre> I would agree Simply Rarity is superior to MLD
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerjunk thank you for stating what needed to be said.
<Meanwhile> TOY_PON3: Try it's...everything. I'm wholly unmoved by heartstring tuggers.
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: i agree
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MLD is a Good Sad fic but it's far from beign something truly great
<emangamer> FRICK
<emangamer> chat crash
<[SWAG]thehated5689> everypony died
<TOY_PON3> Meanwhile: I see, I was bored because I never quite understood the whole Father to Daughter relationship
<[SWAG]thehated5689> it was a disaster
<CCCP> I think its one of the best fan fics ive read mabey even the best
<Wrek> 05how about some music and perhaps even some gaming for a while?
<DaringDude> How is simply rarity?
<Midnight_Fyre> MLD seems too contrived at times to me, which takes me out of the story. It's hard to elaborate on that though without spoilers
<RaveBrony> Ive read about 6 fan fics, 2 im not proud of -_-
<Meanwhile> Go for it Wrek
<DaringDude> YA
<Zappy> Wrek: that sounds good.
<DashWithRainbows> Sure Wrek.
<[SWAG]thehated5689> do eeeeeeet
<DaringDude> Whatchya gonna play?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sounds good Wrek
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Fyre: I agree
<DaringDude> Minecraft

<Dark_Horst> i'm having a huge performance deficit when i can't play tf2 on low settings fluidly. so i need software that finds out what the problem is
<flutter_spin> I've always found that it is best to assume its some freaky like not updating video card driver or not downloading the latest flash player
<Pegasister16> Everypony ready?
<Dark_Horst> i'm running that BF3 driver
<flutter_spin> you're pregnant?
<Zappy> Pegasister16: what is it?

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nothing tastes better than correctly cooked bacon. You know the kind, the one where bacon is freshly served, has a little give, isn't crunchy but not chewy. The one you can bit into and your teeth almost sink into it a bit with little force needed to bite the piece off. It also has just enough grease on it that it feels right yet doesn't dry out due to the lack of it.
<Capn_fisty> and/or a strange degreaser

<Placebo> %
<SuperBrony64> 10,02The first batch of bacon isn't the best, it's always the second batch when you've got enough grease to really let the bacon cook evenly without burnt parts of it. The kind of bacon where you can eat all of it without having to piece out bits of it like some kind of nut.

<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: what did you do this time?
<Placebo> Good thing I have a sandwich..
<Jaegerpony> nope
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Cooking bacon in the microwave is fine!
<Jaegerpony> unless it has a grill
*Placebo Contemplates putting Nutella on a sandwich.
<otakon> Krakass: that's MURDER of GOOD TASTE!
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: >_< nothing... brb dinner
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But it's a SIN to cook the bacon with a paper towel on the plate.
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: don't you lie to me! come BACK!
<IshBestPony> SuperBrony64 bacon with Nutella?
<otakon> my god so much lag
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You never want to cook the bacon on top of a towel.
<Placebo> Put it on the plate? I just wrap the bacon in a paper twoel.
<CCCP> SuperBrony64: i do that
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You want the grease to cook it
<Waffles> true
<RaveBrony> o.o
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You can dry the bacon AFTER you cook it

<SuperBrony64> 10,02You don't like the grease cook the bacon, you get an outside of the bacon that is browned, but the inside that's undercooked
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You cook the two SEPARATE
<Jaegerpony> bacon needs the fast crispy on the side
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Like a true chef.
<Placebo> Bacon-wrapped bacon is best bacon.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02But another great part of bacon...
<Krakass> Have you guys seen the bacon loaf?
<IshBestPony> Placebo wrong, best bacon is bacon-wrapped bacon with bacon bits and extra bacon
<Placebo> SuperBrony64: What's with the bacon talk?
<Tovler|LENT> Bacon-wrapped Asparagus is the best.
<Theoboldi> bah, I need to get some sleep. See ya, guys.
<Jaegerpony> Blumenthal does bacon ice-cream
<TopHat> this conversation
<Placebo> sleep tight, Theoboldi
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Is the little brown stuff that rests in the grease after you cook it. DON'T LIE TO ME, you know you've tried it at least once.

<RAWRity> so...I just got some rather disturbing news.
<Phase4> how does he do that running super jump?
<RaveBrony> D:?
<CCCP> RAWRity: tell us
<Krakass> Bye AC
<CCCP> bye Aircraft
<RAWRity> It seems that, since for he time being they can't spend tons of money to ruin Akira with a live-action movie. They're instead going to do it TO BLEACH.
<KwakLad> RAWRity: i read your fic... finally
<Placebo> Phase4: Pretty sure it's his sword's ability thing. It's more of a super-dash, but he can make it launch him into the air if he ramps it right.
<KwakLad> i liked it!
<RAWRity> Warner Bros. is making a live-action Bleach movie. Why. What. What. Why.
<Phase4> so its ANOTHER superwepon bonus that i cant get until i've played about ~300 hours
<Phase4> thanks valve
<RAWRity> KwakLad: glad you liked it!
<Placebo> Yup.
<Zappy> RAWRity: Curse you Hollywood!!
<Placebo> RAWRity: Ew.
<RaveBrony> Wtf, RAWRity, are you serious!? O_o
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: eeyup.
<Morty> wait RAWRity... really? Bleach the anime?
<RaveBrony> do. not. want.
<Placebo> No, the cleaner.
<Placebo> Lol
<Tovler|LENT> Well, you can't "ruin" Bleach.
<RaveBrony> rofl!
<Pegasister16> Ohai, RAWRity!
<Midnight_Fyre> wow http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/053/e/4/what__s_my_purpose__by_raikoh14-d4qmrph.jpg
<RAWRity> also, Warner's currently working on a Live Action Death Note movie as well.
<RaveBrony> A movie of what bleach has to go through to clean your clothes...great ovie :D
<Placebo> That should end well. /sarcasm

<Rain> <3
<RAWRity> btw, KwakLad. Glad you liked my fic. Now to wait and hope the pre-readers liked it.
<Placebo> Tovler|LENT: I lost interest in it a Long time ago.
<RAWRity> Tovler|LENT: I used to like bleach, but well...the last few years I've been reading it more out of obligation than interest.
<Pegasister16> emangamer: Hey, honey!
<RaveBrony> I liked bleach awhile ago....but then i missed like 3 episodes and became Totally lost :D
<RaveBrony> Then the final seaso of Inuyasha came out and i forgot All other animes :D
<kidzrul434> I wanna be in bed with rainbow dash
<Tovler|LENT> It was cool. There was this new Quincy and some masked guys declared war against Soul Society and...
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: what's there to miss? Aizen is broken as hell and Ichigo had to pull a power out of his ass to win.

<kidzrul434> the cg fails at life
<Meanwhile> Unknown file type, we're boned.

<Tovler|LENT> Bob had a catchphrase?
<Randomnerd> Reboot?
<Jaegerpony> car is broken
<RoflBot> ya reboot
<Meanwhile> I assumed the catchphrase was Reboot.
<Krakass> Still better than most TF2 video animations
<Randomnerd> I mean isn't that his catchphrase?

<Jaegerpony> dog is screwed

<Kammerjunk> It's seriously annoying having a screen larger than 1920x1080.
<Midnight_Tempest> everyone gets infected, they all die... end of show

<Pale_Horse> I'm still surprised that this show got away with depicting Goethe's "Faust".
<Shizuka> 13and that was wishbone!
<CriticKitten> And they explain things pretty well, too. This is a decent summary of how plays work, for young kids.
<Conyst> I remember the halloween episode rather well

<RoflBot> DA GAPHICS
<DeadlyDerp3> wonder what's going on
<CriticKitten> See, maybe it's just me, but a game that feels the need to WARN ME to make multiple saves to keep from being screwed....some part of that rings as "poor design" to me
<LadyCanary> mario_pony: The voice acting was good, the animation style was creative, and it was quite funny.
<DeadlyDerp3> "Hai. I'm stale man"
<CupcakeWarrior> Does this have any gameplay in it?
<Aircrafter> It slightly reminds me of Persona...

<Pale_Horse> I am happy that they re-released the first half of Persona 2 (innocent Sin) for PSP. But I hope that they someday follow up with the other half (Eternal Punishment) as well.
<Everlasting_Joy> ofna01 I think my SNES would say otherwise, but to each his own :).
<LadyCanary> It stopped because they had to make room for new shows, mario_pony.

<DeadlyDerp3> "Cough!"
<CupcakeWarrior> Why were there so many save files being used?
<Everlasting_Joy> Dawn of the Second Day.
<owlicious> this doesn't seem to be Emiya Shirou

<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: use the print screen button on your keyboard, then paste it on MS Paint from clipboard
<Everlasting_Joy> Dawn of the Last Day.
<CriticKitten> Dun care what the game calls her. Her name is Rin.
<NovedCheese> wat game
<Dark_Horst> what'S with the sound scratching?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> CriticKitten: Cool~
<NewDCD> 09,01the scratching comes from resonance from my audio cable and USB cable
<LadyCanary> ...May I kick this Shinji.
<DeadlyDerp3> ...Does Shinji die?
<NewDCD> 09,01it can't be helped
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: thats pretty cool
<CriticKitten> The game can call her whatever it likes, but the character model is IDENTICAL to Rin.
<LadyCanary> He's a RUDE little bugger.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I hope Shinji suffers~
<emangamer> NewDCD: dat resonance

<NewDCD> 09,01but they're not Arthuria or Shirou
<Everlasting_Joy> LadyCanary better idea, we push him in.
<emangamer> Rain: you stilll here??
<NewDCD> 09,01even if they look almost identical
<CriticKitten> So wait, this is a Fate/Stay game?
<NewDCD> 09,01and Shinji's Rider is actually a different person
<CriticKitten> Huh.
<owlicious> more like Fate/EXTRA
<ofna01> how about we take shinji,and PUUSH him somewhere else!
<CupcakeWarrior> Will I be able to understand the plot of this game if i dont know anything about the other Fate games?
<CriticKitten> That would explain why Rin looked identical down to the clothing.
<Pale_Horse> Speaking of guys named Shinji... the fanfic "Shinji and Warhammer 40K" is awesome...
<LadyCanary> >:3 oh Everlasting_Joy, so despicable~
<mario_pony> has anypony here seen the cat in the hat?
