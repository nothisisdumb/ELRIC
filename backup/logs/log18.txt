<Hawkie> and Lakorv, lol
<Hawkie> It sounds just as subjective!
<drfsupercenter> 03One server having a better uptime than another is a fact
<Hawkie> that's kinda the point he's makin
<Hawkie> g
<eXAKR> Come back when your server has uptime of 10 years
<drfsupercenter> 03saying something is stupid is an opinion

<junh1024-XD> do you mean, Fracture?
<eXAKR> No, frak
<drfsupercenter> 03eXAKR, because it's not in the list of banned words?

*eXAKR shot
<Hawkie> LOL
<Lakorv> that is my bouncer.
<Lakorv> so who had the better server?
<drfsupercenter> 03bouncers != server
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<eXAKR> Bounce.
<Hawkie> uh
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: it's hosted on a server.. obviously
<Hawkie> a bouncer runs off a server
<Hawkie> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but in that case yes your machine has a better uptime than mine
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm talking about nest here.
<drfsupercenter> 03that thing was hosted on a Windows machine connected using wifi
<drfsupercenter> 03would go down like twice a week LOL
<eXAKR> I'm still listening to Nyan Cat
<Hawkie> No...
<eXAKR> ...
<Hawkie> it's running just fine.
<Hawkie> it was-
<Hawkie> LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03Arti herself said it was hosted using wireless
<RioX> I always used Ocean because it was stated to be better
<Hawkie> I love Lakorv
<eXAKR> Someone give Arti money to buy a Linux box with wired connections
<Hawkie> seriously
<Hawkie> rio
<RioX> I thought Arti herself said Ocean was better xD
<drfsupercenter> 03she did
<Hawkie> lol.
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Hawkie> Rio
<eXAKR> With Intel Xeon processors
<Hawkie> Other window for a min please?
<eXAKR> 16 GB of RAM
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WTF Xeon
<eXAKR> server-grade fans
<drfsupercenter> 03why Xeon?
<RioX> Other window? o.o
<Hawkie> the skype chat
<drfsupercenter> 03I could build Arti a server... but why would I want to?
<Hawkie> I'll explain something to you
<drfsupercenter> 03I already offered to let Arti take ownership of the server I bought that runs island
<drfsupercenter> 03so >_>
<eXAKR> Because you would lose dictatorship of TST?
<drfsupercenter> 03no>?
<drfsupercenter> 03kindly explain how I have a dictatorship when I don't abuse my power?
<eXAKR> Hmmm.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only times I even use /kill is if someone asks me to
<eXAKR> You ew too much
<eXAKR> That is all
<drfsupercenter> 03like clones that aren't registered so they can't ghost them
<Hawkie> anyway
<junh1024-XD> he could, but he doesn't.
<drfsupercenter> 03implying I can't do that on any ordinary server I'm not in charge of o_O
<eXAKR> Look! 5th gen Pokémon and Apple products!
<drfsupercenter> 03junh1024-XD, that's exactly my point.
<drfsupercenter> 03eXAKR, you abuse scripts too much. Your point?
<junh1024-XD> oho lol
<eXAKR> You ew too much. Back to you
<drfsupercenter> 03you just said the same thing again
<drfsupercenter> 03I could repeat myself too but that's lame
<eXAKR> That is MY point
<drfsupercenter> 03How does me ew'ing stuff have ANYTHING to do with my running a server?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<eXAKR> You make people uninvited.
<eXAKR> That.
<eXAKR> !ew everything
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<drfsupercenter> 06EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW EVERYTHING
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been doing that for years. Long before I got island.
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<drfsupercenter> 03as for that, that's you triggering my script -_-
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<eXAKR> You make people leave TST
<drfsupercenter> 03which, again, brings me back to my point of HOW DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME HOSTING A SERVER
<eXAKR> Because
<eXAKR> IF YOU ARE NOT AROUND PEOPLE WILL COME BACK AS THERE'S NO ONE EWWING.
<drfsupercenter> 03.....
<junh1024-XD> i will
<drfsupercenter> 03me not having a server != me not being here
<eXAKR> Sorry I don't make sense right now because nyan cat.
<drfsupercenter> 03also, eXAKR
<eXAKR> But you having a server here = you must be here
<drfsupercenter> 03there are also people who have left because of too much spamming (read: script abuse)
<drfsupercenter> 03so you're no better than I am.
<eXAKR> ...
*eXAKR sets mode +silence eXAKR
<drfsupercenter> 03Everyone is childish in their own ways. Can we agree to that?
<drfsupercenter> 03<eXAKR> But you having a server here = you must be here <- also, no... my connection dies all the time, the server's hosted in a datacenter somewhere.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm here by choice.
<drfsupercenter> 03off to bed
<Armageddon> derp
*Armageddon hugs Drake
<Minnet> Okay, bye!
<Drake> 04hi
*Drake hugs back
<Drake> 04Your like my friend at school
<Drake> 04she comes up to me and randomly hugs me.
<Drake> 04And gets angry at me when I don't hug back,.
<Drake> 04She's also like, 2 feet shorter than me. It's amusing.
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> she gets angry
<Armageddon> because of that?
<Armageddon> also I passed my Amus @ Drake
<Armageddon> and on another random note
<Drake> 04Awesome
<Armageddon> I honestly don't get what's it so much about osama
<Armageddon> I mean tbqh
<Drake> 04Who now?
*Drake shot
<Armageddon> I don't understand all the hate
<Armageddon> but you know me
<Armageddon> I'm kinda fucked up
<Armageddon> >reminiscence
<Armageddon> >TCTL
<Drake> 04I hated him for what he's done, but I'm not exactly celebrating.
<Drake> 04It's death.
<Armageddon> why do you hate him for what he's done?
<Armageddon> I'm sorry but I fail to understand why people hate terrorism :x
<Drake> 04Because people die
<Ascendant> lolwut.
<Drake> 04That's one simple thing.
<Nova> :(
<Ascendant> What the <censored> was that.
<Armageddon> I'm fucked up
<Armageddon> so tbqh I don't see murder/assassinations/shit as wrong
<Armageddon> but yeah, you know that I'm like that
<Armageddon> :x
<Ascendant> lol the crap that just went on. mfw.
<Drake> 04I understand because they're stories, and they're just that - stories - but when people die in real life, you need to look at it from a different perspective.
<Drake> 04Neither of us have actually seen someone die in front of our eyes, so we don't know what it's like.
<Armageddon> I have
<Armageddon> hm
<Armageddon> that's possibly true
<Armageddon> and I know some things disgust me
<Armageddon> but that doesn't make those things wrong
<Drake> 04To me, killing is wrong. Pure and simple.
<Drake> 04You may kill someone to make life better for others, but that doesn't mean it's "right"
<Drake> 04I know that there's no 'right and wrong' in the world, but that's my right and wrong.
<Armageddon> I never said it was right
<Armageddon> I just said it wasn't wrong either
<Armageddon> personally, I don't really believe there's that much of a "right" and "wrong" with things
<Armageddon> I think that "right" and "wrong" depends on what the person themselves think
<Drake> 04That's what I'm saying...sort of.
<Armageddon> so if they think that killing is right/wrong, then it is, for them at least
<Armageddon> it's all opinion really
<Drake> 04Yes
<Armageddon> but then I hate people who try to force their opinion on others.
<Armageddon> now that's just retarded.
<Armageddon> Anyway
<Armageddon> bbl dinner
<Drake> 04k
<Armageddon> starving and I want to eat food
*Armageddon hugs Drake and poofs
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I can eat it at my desk
<Drake> 04it's awesome
<Armageddon> EWWWWWWWWW
<Armageddon> Choices are:-
<Armageddon> Sexual health
<Armageddon> Drugs & binge drinking
<Armageddon> Parent-teen communication
<Armageddon> Internet safety/getting home safely/safe partying
<Armageddon> Eating & diet
<Armageddon> Depression
<Armageddon> seminar SHIT
<Armageddon> What should I do?
<Drake> 04wait what
<Armageddon> we have a seminar thing at school next week
<Drake> 04What is this?
<Armageddon> and we have to select what topic
<Armageddon> those are the topics
<Drake> 04oh
<Armageddon> what should I do?
<Drake> 04um
<Armageddon> sexual health?
<Armageddon> so I can do it with you later
*Armageddon hides
<Drake> 04Do sexual health, depression or that internet crap
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> >internet safety
<Armageddon> my ass
<Armageddon> when they try to teach me about "not getting corrupted"
<Drake> 04loooool
<Armageddon> mfw I'm already corrupted, fuckers
<Drake> 04They're a bit late much?
<Armageddon> SUCK ON IT
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> 2 years too late
<Armageddon> might do that just for the lulz
<Drake> 04Nah
<Drake> 04do sexual health
<Armageddon> but it'd be boring
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04"Impress" them
<Armageddon> I'll do sexual health
<Armageddon> lmaaaaaaaao
<Armageddon> wonder if they'll make us put condoms on bananas
<Armageddon> we're going to be doing that during class though
<Drake> 04We never did that in PDHP
<Armageddon> but what the fuck
<Armageddon> why do we need to learn
<Armageddon> how to put condoms on penises?
<Armageddon> we're fucking girls
<Armageddon> don't have penises
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04It's kind of straightforward anyway
<Armageddon> are our husbands retarded enough to NOT know how to put on a condom?
<Armageddon> or at least admit they don't
<Drake> 04Unless there's this weird mechanic it has just to make it difficult
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> deeeeeeerp
<Armageddon> anyway

<Drake> 04I doubt I'm that much like you.
<Armageddon> of course
<Armageddon> else you'd be retarded
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> but yes
<Armageddon> Reminiscence and TCTL are basically results of daydreams + philosophies
<Armageddon> So pretty much what I have my characters say in them are what I believe
<Drake> 04I figured
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> Reminiscence's key theme is freedom
<Armageddon> TCTL's is right and wrong
<Armageddon> and also evil/good
<Drake> 04Alot of my stories relay my feelings and opinions.
<Armageddon> although personally, I don't believe in evil
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04DoI is about how you should have your own thoughts and opinions.
<Drake> 04CoE is more about how you shouldn't let beuocracy/politics or religion rule you.
<Drake> 04beurocracy*
<Armageddon> lol politics.
<Armageddon> lol religion.
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> DoI is somewhat similar to Reminiscence then
<Armageddon> and CoE is more like TCTL
<Drake> 04There are other underlying themes, but those two are the main ones.
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> although
<Armageddon> tbqh
<Armageddon> TCTL has a shitload of themes
<Armageddon> the main ones are right and wrong/good and bad
<Armageddon> but there's also stuff like limits and imagination
<Armageddon> not sure if you even read it/noticed it
<Armageddon> but derp
<Drake> 04I read it sometimes.
<Drake> 04Hmm
<Drake> 04The prequel to DoI doesn't really have a theme now that I think about it
<Armageddon> heh
<Armageddon> tbqh I still like TMoaTB
<Armageddon> TMoaTB's theme is something like
<Drake> 04What would it's theme be anyway?
<Armageddon> loyalty and independence or something

<Armageddon> etc.
<Drake> 04eh
<Drake> 04maybe
<Drake> 04never put too much thought into TMoaTB
<Armageddon> what do you think Reminiscence's theme is? lol
<Ascendant> wttttttttttttttf
<Drake> 04Freedom, how the world is grey, not black and white, loyalty, friendship, underlying hints of love between friends and colleagues.
<Ascendant> eXAKR
<Ascendant> fix your bloody connection
<Armageddon> love
<Armageddon> lolwut
<Drake> 04I'm getting a real nakama sense between Seran and the DM's, the Kommander and The Hensh
<Drake> 04not love as in lovey-dovey
<Drake> 04but a close bond
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> Seran, the DMs, Kommander Kulesz and The Hensh are pretty close, yeah
<Armageddon> and that pretty much sums it what
<Armageddon> up*
<Armageddon> what do you think about TCTL, then?
<Ascendant> -_-
<Drake> 04From what I've read...eh, black/white again, your own opinions on right/wrong, and how complex people are and that you can't take them for face value.
<Drake> 04eX dies alot.
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04Rathicus and Dragoran are very complex. You also seem to enjoy having a stern but understanding leader + a sarcastic second-in-command.
<Armageddon> TCTL is more black/white than Reminiscence
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> Dragoran isn't really sarcastic
<Drake> 04Rathicus and Dragoran = The Kommander and the Hensh
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> Dragoran is more...playful and joking around
<Armageddon> he's not the serious type of guy
<Drake> 04Also
<Drake> 04Does it make sense for someone who takes alot of things literally (such as idioms and sarcastic comments) to be sarcastic himself?
<Armageddon> sort of
<Armageddon> he does get offended easily, amirite?
<Armageddon> and he's not like The Hensh, right?
<Drake> 04Sort of.
<Armageddon> is he like the Hensh?
<Drake> 04Only when about topics he doesn't understand (such as, everything)

<Drake> 04He's not constantly sarcastic
<Armageddon> oic
<Armageddon> well The Hensh isn't always sarcastic
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> he's just impossible
<Drake> 04Basically, he was raised to have no frickin' idea about regular life and stuff.
<Armageddon> seriously
<Armageddon> ah
<Armageddon> well then that sort of makes sense
<Armageddon> not really
<Armageddon> XD
<Drake> 04He's basically a living weapon with alot of poetic skill.
<Armageddon> ooookay
<Drake> 04I make my characters too sarcastic
<Armageddon> do you mean "get offended/take it seriously"
<Armageddon> when you say "literally"
<Ascendant> I just disconnected
<Ascendant> :x
<Drake> 04Not 'get offended', like the phrase "It's raining cats and dogs" he'll go "No it's not, it's just water."
<Ascendant> and nah
<Ascendant> it takes quite a lot to get me mad
<Ascendant> Drake knows that
<Drake> 04Yep
<Armageddon> Ah
<Drake> 04Although noobs get on her nerves.
<Drake> 04So very much.
<Drake> 04Keep them away.

<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> it doesn't really make that much sense
<Armageddon> but it could
<Armageddon> if his personality is like that
<Drake> 04hmm
<Drake> 04I'll put it into his character when he gets older then
<Ascendant> lol lag much
<Drake> 04Because by then he'll know alot more and he'll be more comfortable.
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> but like
<Armageddon> Rathicus is sort of like Kommander Kulesz I guess
<Armageddon> but Dragoran isn't really like The Hensh
<Armageddon> Dragoran isn't sarcastic
<Armageddon> There's also a third person along with Rathicus and Dragoran though (not Syril)
<Armageddon> She's revealed in chapter 9
<Armageddon> one damn psycho bitch
<Armageddon> reminds me of Arcane
<Armageddon> :x
<Drake> 04Whatever happened to that angel character, the one you always used to kick Velimoth's ass when we RPed?

<Ascendant> okay but just ignore me
<Ascendant> I'm extremely fcked up etc.
<Umbreon> 12it's a topic i refuse to get into
<Ascendant> I'll probably grow up to be a terrorist too /sarcasm
<Ascendant> no but seriously
<Ascendant> I don't understand
<Umbreon> 12google it
<Ascendant> I read something that said australians wouldn't really understand until planes crashed into the opera house etc.
<Ascendant> but tbqh I wouldn't give a damn.
<Ascendant> actually I'd probably be like "yay" because that thing is retarded
<Umbreon> 12how would you feel if planes crashed into Drake's house?
<Ascendant> trying to imagine that.
<Ascendant> if he doesn't die I'd be okay with it I guess
<Ascendant> if he does die...idk
<Umbreon> 12exactly, a lot of people have killed but he killed tons of people
<Umbreon> 12and when people lose someone very special to them, it gets personal
<Ascendant> I see
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> right
<Ascendant> well
<Ascendant> I'd probably bawwwwwww all over it for a while

<Ascendant> I'm not exactly the most caring person on the planet lol
<Ascendant> in fact, I'm probably quite far from that
<Ascendant> :x
<Umbreon> 12i'm just going to say this to be funny
<Umbreon> 12but how would you feel if a plane crashed into your house, and you were inside
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> let me think
<Ascendant> would I have enough time to be like "holy crap" or something?
<Ascendant> aka would the plane kill me? derp
<Umbreon> 12you'd probably have like a 5% chance at surviving for more than 5 seconds lol
<Ascendant> then I probably wouldn't feel anything
<Umbreon> 12i had a feeling you'd say that
<Ascendant> pretty much
<Ascendant> but derp
<Ascendant> I'm like, one of those people/as*holes who basically think that everyone should fend for themselves
<Umbreon> 12kind of hard to do that when you're buried under 20 feet of destroyed building
<Umbreon> 12with no pulse
<Ascendant> I don't feel sorry for people that much lol

<Ascendant> lmaaaaaaaao
<Ascendant> but well
<Ascendant> see, I've had a rather rocky past
<Ascendant> I've been bullied, hit, hurt, etc. by everyone around me
<Ascendant> I stopped caring about them
<Umbreon> 12and you have no one to help
<Umbreon> 12*had
<Ascendant> I stopped caring about everyone else
<Ascendant> pretty much
<Umbreon> 12not everyone was raised like that
<Ascendant> I know
<Ascendant> but that's probably most of what caused me to be like this

<Umbreon> 12you have sort of gotten into the habit of relying on yourself, but some people literally use other people like crutches

<Ascendant> but
<Umbreon> 12you should open up more :)
<Ascendant> it's people like all you
<Ascendant> who I care about
<Ascendant> ...such a shame there aren't that many to open up to
<Umbreon> 12then be less strict with who you give information to

<Umbreon> 12trying to create the light bulb". (The story is often told as 5,000
<Umbreon> 12or 10,000 times depending on the version.) When asked about it,
<Umbreon> 12Edison allegedly said, "I have not failed 1,000 times. I have

<Ascendant> psychology != physics/science
<lightumbreon|laptop> AH

<Ascendant> psychology is the study of the mind or something

<drfsupercenter> 03they had godugly sprites
<Nick> all I know is the green version nintendo console in the trainer's bedroom was a snes while red and blue US was n64
<Nick> yeah I remember....pidgeot.....uuuughghghgugh
<drfsupercenter> 03then there was a "special edition" Blue version that came out in Japan, it was a promo only type thing, you had to subscribe to some magazine to get it
<drfsupercenter> 03That had much better sprites

<drfsupercenter> 03and there are very few exceptions to that
<Nick> transformers, ghostbusters...
*Nick runs
<Dialga> it sucks to people like us who like to feel self-righteous about not being into what everyone else is into :33c
<drfsupercenter> 03more or less
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, stuff like Windows that everyone uses, yes those are good :P
<Nick> well I'm sort of the opposite, if there's something I like, I want to see it do well
<drfsupercenter> 03but I try to avoid super popular products
<drfsupercenter> 03ah well
<drfsupercenter> 03if I like something, and then it becomes popular, that's fine
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don't want to start liking something because everyone else does
<Dialga> yeah i like things if they have merit to be liked, not "hay evryone plyas it"
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL fail, I accidentally called a FAX number
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wasn't expecting to like MLP, heck I don't even know what I like about it |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just wanted to know wtf made it so damn popular
<Angel_Espeon> 13But meh, I'm not addicted/obsessed or anything, I just like it
<Nick> same here angel espy
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Nick> anyway about MLP I read on that old 80's cartoon site that the original pilot MLP mini movie special thing, was actually REALLY dark apparantly
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<Nick> for like you know, a show aimed a girls with brightly oversaturated ponies living in a land of makeup candy and sunny hill valley rainbow lands :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol I hated the original
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Anyway, dinner
<Nick> but yeah, this was like a one of for the original series cos after that it did get toned down, but in the pilot, demons riding dragons would kidnap ponies, take them to a spooky castle with a satanic looking overlord who used some bag full of dark magic to transform the ponies into more dragons and demons to serve this dark lord
<Nick> he even threatened to behead spike the dragon xD I'm dead serious
*Damos sets mode: +cookie Nick
<Nick> wait what that do to me?
<Craiglol> 03Just watch an episode or two if you're actually interested
<Craiglol> 03Or at least want to know what the fuss was about
<Craiglol> 03since that what I did
<Craiglol> 03I just saw it was so popular
<Craiglol> 03and wondered why on earth people would like MY LITTLE PONY, of all the shows
<Craiglol> 03then I watched it
<Craiglol> 03and became brainwashed
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Nick> which one the new one?
<HyperMetalLugia> I watched the first ep
<HyperMetalLugia> I liked
<Craiglol> 03Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> I never watched again

*Armageddon hugs Drake
<Drake> 04hi NS
*Drake hugs back
<Armageddon> heya :3
<Armageddon> so
<Armageddon> what was that about KK vs Dyan?
*Armageddon hides
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Wait
<Drake> 04I wrote a short story today
<Armageddon> o_o
<Drake> 04about Rhy, Nathan and Leo at Movieworld
<Armageddon> ...lol
<Drake> 04http://lyontheshadowlord.deviantart.com/#/d3g2v1s
<Armageddon> I think Rhy would just complain
<Armageddon> "what better way to have fun than visit Movie World near the Gold Cost for the day?"
<Armageddon> Cost
<Armageddon> lol
<Armageddon> "debate all the philosophical and moral reasons behind Osama bin Laden's attack on the Twin Towers,"
<Armageddon> lol'd
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> I'd like that
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> because you'd probably end up groaning
<Armageddon> over how impossible it is to convince me of something
*Armageddon hides
<Drake> 04Most likely XD
<Armageddon> derp
<Armageddon> btw
<Armageddon> Leo is kinda OOC
<Armageddon> :x
<Drake> 04blah
<Drake> 04It was a short story
<Armageddon> I know
<Armageddon> I got my short story back today
<Armageddon> teacher gave me a 15/20 lol
<Armageddon> but hey
<Armageddon> I wrote it in 30 minutes
<Drake> 04nice
<Armageddon> and considering it was ONLY fucking 1000 words
<Armageddon> too short damnit
<Drake> 04I KNOW RIGHT
<Drake> 04they never give you enough words
<eXAKR> gtg bbl
<Armageddon> damn fucking right
<Armageddon> make it at least 1500, bitches
<Armageddon> actually hell
<Armageddon> make it 5000
<Armageddon> I'll still probably go over the limit though
<Armageddon> :x
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> make it 20000 and I shouldn't be in danger of that
<Armageddon> :x
<Umbreon> 12bye

<Drake> 04lolwat
*Armageddon hugs Drake
<Armageddon> boy
<Armageddon> let's write KK vs Dyan now
<Armageddon> or Rathicus vs Dyan
<Armageddon> Rathicus would probably suit it more
<Armageddon> as he's more villainous
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> and he's actually bad
<Drake> 04not really in the modd
<Drake> 04mood*
<Armageddon> >:
<Armageddon> Alright
<Drake> 04you can write it if you want though
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> I don't write short stories
<Armageddon> or oneshots, really
<Drake> 04ok then
<Armageddon> you should know that by now Drake
<Drake> 04well I'll admit I've never seen you write a short story, neither have I actually heard you say you dislike it
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> you haven't seen anything besides "The Thief"
<Armageddon> and even then that one isn't a good example
<Armageddon> I can write short stories
<Armageddon> Doesn't mean I will
<Armageddon> Hell
<Drake> 04:/
<Armageddon> you could possibly count the Fro x HML as a short story if you want
<Armageddon> but I wouldn't
<Armageddon> :x
<Armageddon> I'll go write one for you after I come back from dinner
<Armageddon> might be Nightshadow/Drake or Rhy/Leo/Nathan or Rathicus/Dragoran/Syril or Reminiscence
<Armageddon> or something random
<Armageddon> idk
<Armageddon> I'll decide later
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> bbl dinner

<Lakorv> I think I'll pass
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> What OS do you use?
<Lakorv> also, > assuming people have apt-get
<Lakorv> enjoy your VERSION, silly
<Ascendant> most linux OSes have apt-get
<Ascendant> derp
<Lakorv> no they don't.
<Ascendant> or at least the popular ones do
<Ascendant> or yum
<Lakorv> far from all.
<Lakorv> apt-get is to be found in Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems.
<Ascendant> or the other package installer stuffs
<Ascendant> debian is awesome though derp
*Lakorv uses Arch.
<Ascendant> redhat/centos/etc uses yum
<Ascendant> ah
<Ascendant> I haven't used Archlinux
<Lakorv> that makes my package manager pacman.
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> What desktop environment does Archlinux use?
<Lakorv> none.
<Ascendant> o-o
<Lakorv> Arch comes without a graphical environment.
<Lakorv> you put whatever you want on it.
<Lakorv> Arch comes with just the most basic requirements to run.
<Ascendant> Ah
<Lakorv> I use Awesome with Xfce/gtk apps.
<Ascendant> xfce lol
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> at least it doesn't use KDE
<Ascendant> or Unity for that matter
<Ascendant> ubuntu recently decided to switch to Unity instead of Gnome :x
<Lakorv> You could throw KDE on it
<Ascendant> Archlinux makes me think of freebsd though, as that doesn't have a GUI
<Lakorv> there probably is a Unity package by now.
<Ascendant> unity is retarded
<Lakorv> you can put just about whatever on Arch.
<Lakorv> I never heard of people using KDE with Arch
<Lakorv> but there are packages for it.
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I mostly use debian (especially for servers) but I'm on linux mint
<Ascendant> this laptop has winxp and linux mint 9
<Ascendant> mint comes with a lot of useless crap :x
<Lakorv> that's one of the reasons I like Arch
<Lakorv> it comes with nothing, thus no crap.
<Lakorv> this is how my screen looked a lil' while ago, showing only irc: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-05_irssi.png
<Ascendant> Ah
<Lakorv> also, me prodding my IRC bot's code: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-03-09_minnet.png
<Ascendant> What programming language is that? sort of looks like C
<Ascendant> ;x
<Lakorv> Lua.
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> never heard of it
<Lakorv> protip: the headers read "File: cmdarray.lua", "File: db.lua" :P
<Ascendant> I saw the .lua bit
<Armageddon> o-o
<Lakorv> and just because I can
<Lakorv> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5525458/2011-05-05.png - current desktop.
<Ascendant> looks nice
<Ascendant> clean etc.
<Ascendant> heh
<Ascendant> arch sounds like the complete opposite of ubuntu
<Ascendant> I don't like ubuntu
<Armageddon> DRAKE.
<Armageddon> it's past your bed time
<Armageddon> when do you go? >:
<Drake> 04not sure
<Drake> 04I should actually be in bed
<Drake> 04oh well
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> stay longer
*Armageddon hugs
<Lakorv> Arch also has a rolling release model
<Lakorv> there is never a new version of Arch, stuff is just updated whenever new things come.
<Drake> 04I'll try
*Drake hugs back
<Armageddon> :3
*Armageddon hugs
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I haven't updated my friend's ubuntu server :x
<Ascendant> there's like, 136 updates needed, 91 security updates
<Ascendant> :x
<Drake> 04You hug me alot lately
<Lakorv> rofl
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> because I want to visit you
<Lakorv> staeld@aridhol ~ $ pacman -Qu | wc -l
<Lakorv> 12
<Lakorv> 12 updates for my laptop.
<Lakorv> yay, new minor release for the kernel.
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> 146 packages can be updated.
<Ascendant> 97 updates are security updates.
<Ascendant> too lazy to run updates
<Lakorv> there's no such thing as a security update here.. all updates are software updates of one kind or another.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew kernels ;p
<Drake> 04XD
*Lakorv installs an obsolete 2.6.24-kernel on HyperMetalLugia.
<Drake> 04So you can hug me?
*Drake hides
<Ascendant> well, ubuntu is crap
<Lakorv> ...wow. 2.6.24 was some time ago.
<HyperMetalLugia> And you call that a desktop XD
<Lakorv> now downloading 2.6.38.6 :p
<Lakorv> HyperMetalLugia: yes indeed, why shouldn't I?
<Lakorv> it's just not cluttered like most people seem to like them.
<HyperMetalLugia> Not compatible
<Lakorv> I don't see why I need stuff on the desktop.
<HyperMetalLugia> Windows derp ;D
<Armageddon> pretty much
<Armageddon> I never got to hug you last time
<Lakorv> it's a place for a wallpaper and some stats.
<HyperMetalLugia> And that seems to be all :P
<Ascendant> windows sucks.
<HyperMetalLugia> Really, they should just remove the wallpaper and stats features and make into DOS
<Ascendant> DOS is crap.
<HyperMetalLugia> With no colour either ;}
<Ascendant> hah
<Ascendant> my terminal is awesome
<Ascendant> green on black background
<Ascendant> THE MATRIX.
<HyperMetalLugia> Same here derp
<HyperMetalLugia> When I get bothered to use linux that is
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> I had purple text on black before
<HyperMetalLugia> (Hint: That's never, or rare)

<Mikey> hi
<Mikey> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkyay1MRxv1qzxegjo1_500.jpg
<Lambda> O.O
<Lambda> scary
<Stormy> D:
<Mikey> XD
<Lambda> Pikachu looks insane and Ash looks like a furry
<Mikey> ....they DO
<Mikey> omg
<Mikey> D:
<Lambda> Hahaha
<Lambda> I just noticed that his hat says "WTF"
<Mikey> lol
<Stormy> wtf is a good way to describe it XD
<Lambda> yeah it is :P
<Lambda> also, I just thought I'd point it out before I forget
<Stormy> Mikey, have you noticed how annoying Swaffy has been lately?
<Lambda> we all have a bit of Fluttershy in us
<Stormy> lol
<Mikey> when was swaffy not annoying?
<Stormy> well, never
<Mikey> link?
<Stormy> but I seemed to have more tolerance for him than most people
<Stormy> Now he's even annoying me
<Stormy> I'll find a couple
<Mikey> why what's he saying now
*Lambda starts venturing back to the forums he goes to
<Mikey> "I KNOW RELIGIOUS DEBATES AREN'T ALLOWED ON THE FORUM BUT I'M GOING TO START ONE ANYWAYS"
<Stormy> Not even anything specific
<Lambda> OFF and Spyroforum, prepare for some Lambda-posting
<Stormy> Like here's one
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-346189.html#346189
<Mikey> wow that's pointless
<Stormy> herp derp I reported you
<Stormy> then here used to be a post saying "don't abuse the word filter" with a quote with the filtered word in it
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-344035.html#344035
<Lambda> oh hey one more post and I'll be at 50
<Mikey> 50 posts!?! what an accomplishment!
<Mikey> :P
<Stormy> then http://www.spyroforum.com/post-344873.html#344873 and http://www.spyroforum.com/post-345696.html#345696 making it VERY CLEAR that he doesn't care
<Stormy> lol good job
<Stormy> I just broke 4000 on SF
<Stormy> @__@
<Lambda> will I not be a Dragonfly anymore after 50? :P
<Stormy> I dunno
<Stormy> RDX ended up doing the rankings
<Lambda> I SHALL FIND OUT :D
<Stormy> and he spelled "Rhynoc" wrong
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> oh yeah, and the piracy thing
<Stormy> where he said that he only pirates because he doesn't have the money
<Stormy> and everyone who disagrees with him about piracy is an atheist
<Mikey> omg yeah that bugged me alot
<Stormy> I dunno, he's just... never been this annoying
<Stormy> I almost wonder if he's turned into a troll
<Mikey> it's also like saying PEOPLE WHO DON'T STEAL AREN'T WHOLESOME CHRISTIANS LIKE ME
<Lambda> off topic, and I apologize, but I am still a dragonfly :(
<Mikey> yeah me too
<Stormy> if he has, he's a pretty successful one -.-
<Stormy> It's probably at 100 then Lambda
<Lambda> I think he turned into a troll as soon as he realized SR was NOT going to make him a mod
<Stormy> XD probably
<Lambda> and as soon as SR stopped being nice to him :P
<Stormy> "All my best behavior isn't making me a moderator, so I'm going to be as annoying as possible"
<Lambda> "If the mod isn't gonna be mah fraaaand what's the point of taking this place srsly"
<Stormy> mah fraaand hahaha
<Lambda> *admin
<Mikey> yes to both of those @___@;
<Lambda> I should post in his guestbook! :D
<Lambda> jk
<Mikey> you should

<Neon> Fivers don't grow on trees.
<prince-dari> I think it was a mibbit advert.
<Mikey> didn't kja add it
<Neon> Yup.
<Lambda> Hmm, I feel like it was either him or Inf
<Lambda> speaking of which where are those two?
<Lambda> we have an election to hold
<Guest98859> still not in
<Neon> Where's gerpie, while we're asking?
<Curly> RA!
<Mikey> he froze to death in the bowl
<prince-dari> Oh dear.
<Lambda> gerpie got flushed down the toilet
<Proto`> Well it started up again
<Stormy> :(
<Curly> what's going on?
<Lambda> we got a new fish though
<Neon> What a waste. Badoomtash.
<Proto`> ECNet is being spammed
<Lambda> a robot fish!
<Lambda> ChanServ
<Curly> is that our network or something else? >.>
<Neon> FinServ.
<prince-dari> At least we don't need to feed him.
<Proto`> ECNet is just ECNet
<Neon> Cue 8-bit Jaws theme.
<Lambda> what's Aristeo's role in our family?
<Curly> I see
*Aristeo peeks in
<Aristeo> I'm yo daddy :3
<Neon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4og2MDiwM4
<Guest98859> Proto`, every channel or just laserchat
<Lambda> so you're the grandpa?
<Proto`> I can't tell
<Mikey> so aristeo's my grandpa?
<Aristeo> :3
<Proto`> afaik it's laserchat
<Aristeo> Curly!!!!!!!!!!!
<Lambda> so it would seem
<Mikey> interesting
<Lambda> well, step grandpa
<Neon> The song would've been perfect in Bowser's castle.
<Lambda> awesome-ass step grandpa I suppose
<Lambda> *cool-ass
<Mikey> lol
<Stormy> o.o
<Neon> You can't use alliteration in hyphenated ass statements. It's like putting catsup on eggs... it's just wrong.
<Mikey> "catsup" lol
<Proto`> Guess it's all of them
<Proto`> Based on that global
<Lambda> haha, who even calls it that anymore? :P
<Neon> It's just a spelling. You still say it the same.
<Lambda> oh
<Mikey> neon apparently
<Lambda> lol
<Lambda> what was Neon's role again?
<Lambda> wasn't he your cousin or something?
<prince-dari> Neon has been promoted to resident Nyan Cat.
<Curly> hey Ari!!!!!!
<Lambda> Quiet butler!
<Lambda> I'm not paying you to speak!
<Neon> Some I've been trolling the crap out of Barowl lately.
<Lambda> jk
<prince-dari> My apologies sir.
<Neon> But he finally caught on.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Kosovo02)03WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
<Mikey> XD
<Mikey> barowl is annoying
*HyperMetalLugia is scared of squid
<HyperMetalLugia> But at least they're tasty
<Neon> He said "There's no way ponies are unattractive!" leaving me with the opportunity, nay, the /moral obligation/ to troll his ass.
<Mikey> hahaha
<Lambda> haha, I saw that
<Mikey> I'm the one who's head went straight through the urinal
<prince-dari> Lol, neigh.
<Lambda> XD
<Stormy> What, he's a pony furry?
<Lambda> Mikey: did someone actually say that?
<Neon> Not really, but if you took what he said out of context it looked like it.
<Mikey> no
<Lambda> aww
<Mikey> :P
<Neon> He was /extremely/ defesnive, though, so it wouldn't shock me if he was, Stormy.
<Neon> *defensive
<Guest98859> im sad im being left out :(
<Lambda> Neon called him an eguinophile
<Lambda> *equiniphile
<Lambda> he got super mad
<Mikey> and that's how equestria was made
<Proto`> Well now it's just random spam messages
<Proto`> This time it was LOL
<Guest98859> its just a botnet
<Neon> Yeah, then I apologized and said I mean "schediaphile." xDDD
<Guest98859> the nicks are predictable
<Guest98859> 4 characters all the time
<Lambda> what is schedia?
<prince-dari> I think the actual word is hippophile (saw it on ponychan).
<Neon> Which is a sexual attraction to cartoon characters.
<Lambda> ah
<prince-dari> For horses.
<Proto`> Not anymore
<Neon> Dari: I made up the term offhand, hippophile sounds right.
<Lambda> so he's a schediaequiniphiliac
<prince-dari> ^LOL
<Stormy> haha
<Guest98859> what are they like now?
<Guest98859> I mean the realnames
<Proto`> well they're like random mashes of keyboards
<Neon> So he ends with saying "I'm not going to give you the pleasure of responding," which meant the party was over for the day.
<Proto`> I think that's the realname?
<Mikey> well at least for you
<Lambda> Koj is still calling him Body Oder
<Mikey> then he went into the other room and started talking to a bucket of turnips.
<Lambda> *Odor
<Mikey> you mean Ammeg?
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Lambda> I do mean ammeg
<Mikey> koj isn't near as annoying as ammeg is
<Guest98859> copy and paste a line from when one joins
<Lambda> no he isn't
<Lambda> I kinda like koj
<Mikey> same
<Proto`> * anrufchmewd (mkayd@ecnet-559B9240.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #laserchat

<drf|laptop> 03there's a 5.5?
<junh1024-XD> there's a 5.5!
<drf|laptop> 03wtf does it do?
<HyperMetalLugia> Nothing?
<junh1024-XD> it installs CS 5.5 on your computer.
<Umbreon> 12what the heck
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, what does 5.5 have that 5 doesn't
<Umbreon> 12firefox wasn't my default web browser?
<Umbreon> 12when did that happen
<HyperMetalLugia> hurr
<junh1024-XD> A4, AE 5.5, IS/ID 5.5, AX
<junh1024-XD> etcetc
<HyperMetalLugia> o,o
<drf|laptop> 03I have AX from standalone, but there's an A4?
<junh1024-XD> I've been ranting on about the new A4 in #p-o & here
<junh1024-XD> you got short-term memory ploblem?
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't seen it
<drf|laptop> 03is it any better than 3?
<junh1024-XD> thats tr00
<junh1024-XD> it's better and worse.
<junh1024-XD> do you need to edit in surround?
<drf|laptop> 03I thought A3 did that?
<junh1024-XD> its easier in A4, since its inline, not simulated.
<Charles> K, while I am merely backing my data up as a safeguard, I may actually just fully switch to new Ubuntu for my netbook
<drf|laptop> 03eh
<drf|laptop> 03so should I get rid of all this CS5 crap I just installed and install CS5.5?
<junh1024-XD> when you mixdown it is genuine surround, but its just nonintuitive not being able to work in native surround, thats all
<junh1024-XD> up2u, some apps weren't updated.
<junh1024-XD> check out adobe.com for new features. if you don't need it, don't install
<drf|laptop> 03well does the CS5.5 master suite include Acrobat and Audition?
<drf|laptop> 03as those two I had to do separately with 5
<junh1024-XD> >master
<junh1024-XD> it does now, since A4 is CS.
<junh1024-XD> AX releases are often separate from CS.
<drf|laptop> 03wait so instead of CS it's A4?
<junh1024-XD> *new
<junh1024-XD> what
<junh1024-XD> A3 wasn't in CS.
<drf|laptop> 03wait

<drf|laptop> 03anyway eh
<drf|laptop> 03since I already have AX I'll just leave CS5 alone
<junh1024-XD> did you even need any new features in AcrobatX?
<drf|laptop> 03sorta
<junh1024-XD> which ones?
<drf|laptop> 03because with Acrobat 9, it kept erroring when I tried to open PDFs inside my browser
<drf|laptop> 03so it's mainly to fix that, as X seems to work well for now
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it did tlhat for my mom too and she was using the free Adobe Reader 8
<drf|laptop> 03and I had 9
<drf|laptop> 03and both did that
<drf|laptop> 03it would be like "An error has occured so you can't view this PDF in your browser' and would open separately

<drf|laptop> 03I will in about a month
<drf|laptop> 03actually
<drf|laptop> 03I might have it next week
<nickstr> we have it in HD already
<junh1024-XD> hmm, ntx then & internets
<drf|laptop> 03nickstr, I have cable
<nickstr> not that it really matters
<HyperMetalLugia> What provider DRF?
<nickstr> I don't watch Disney XD anyway
<junh1024-XD> WOW or UMICH?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<drf|laptop> 03yeah it's 433MB
<drf|laptop> 03junh1024-XD, bayleef.
<drf|laptop> 03nickstr, it matters to me since you can't direct stream copy record satellite :P
<drf|laptop> 03so cable FTW
<nickstr> not so
<drf|laptop> 03http://bayleef.hoshinet.org/~drf/Shaun%20the%20Sheep%20-%20Zebra%20Ducks%20of%20the%20Serengeti.ts
<nickstr> you still get it from satellites
<drf|laptop> 03orly
<drf|laptop> 03you can GET the channel, you can't RECORD it on your computer
<nickstr> that is how the "cable" channels backhaul signals
<nickstr> yes you can
<nickstr> with special tuner cards
<junh1024-XD> you can do it with KIDS & WOWOW, not?
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Credit
<drf|laptop> 03I mean American satellite.
<junh1024-XD> > with special tuner cards < i can buy one for DVB_S in NZ
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<nickstr> Dish Network and DirecTV use DVB-S
<junh1024-XD> inb4: indirectV
<drf|laptop> 03yes but encrypted
<nickstr> I can recall seeing it on early receivers from both providers
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, I get disney XD HD on June 9th.
<drf|laptop> 03so not next week
<drf|laptop> 03http://content.wowway.com/documents/WOWWAY/PDFs/Cable/DTA/MichiganTransition.pdf
<drf|laptop> 03but I will have Starz kids HD next week, so hopefully I can record Pokémon 4Ever off it, as they regularly show that movie
<drf|laptop> 03and Starz usually doesn't upscale. :P
<nickstr> you are forgetting something else
<nickstr> HD satellite receivers from both providers offer component video out
<drf|laptop> 03hm?
<drf|laptop> 03I said DIRECT STREAM COPY
<nickstr> I does not effing matter
<drf|laptop> 03doing that is recompressing already compressed material
<nickstr> you will be getting the stuff in HD as is
<drf|laptop> 03and component doesn't do 5.1 audio :P
<drf|laptop> 03I just have a CableCard from my provider, I pay like $3 a month for it
<drf|laptop> 03and get everything
<drf|laptop> 03none of this tier BS
<nickstr> meh
<nickstr> cab;e
<nickstr> *cable
<drf|laptop> 03the cable system here is really good
<nickstr> pay through the roof for less
<drf|laptop> 03and you might be pleased that they're getting rid of analog next week
<drf|laptop> 03I'm kinda annoyed as the two CRTs we have in our house now need special settop boxes >_>
<drf|laptop> 03but that's what's allowing them to add like 50 more HD channels
<nickstr> in fact Pokemon 4 Ever should have been bundled instead of Destiny Deoxys
<nickstr> that is a serious WTF thing
<junh1024-XD> or M6
<nickstr> not 6
<nickstr> bundle 6 and 7
<nickstr> not 5 and 6
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 misty
<drf|laptop> 03there IS a movie 4 and 5 bundle DVD
<nickstr> more like EWW ADVANCED GENERATION
<drf|laptop> 03and it has movie 4 in widescreen :P
<nickstr> SD
<drf|laptop> 03yes SD, but widescreen
<drf|laptop> 03anamorphic
<drf|laptop> 03Heroes is still crap
<nickstr> I am moving over to HD and would prefer HD over SD
<drf|laptop> 03as much as I agree iwth you that pre-AG > AG, movie 7 is my second favorite.
<drf|laptop> 03I just love the whole city, how it's all techy xD
<drf|laptop> 03and Rayquaza is probably my favorite Pokémon so you do the math
<junh1024-XD> the masters that most TV stations get for M4 aren't HD. Haven't seen any.
<nickstr> then I will send the Destiny Deoxys Blu Ray to you if I buy the bundle
<junh1024-XD> M5, however, was HD in JAPAn, i think
<drf|laptop> 03junh1024-XD, Starz is special
<junh1024-XD> M5 US, unsure/
<drf|laptop> 03I mean, there is *no* existing rip *anywhere* of the movie Hollywood Homicide in anything above DVD resolution
<drf|laptop> 03but it aired on Starz HD in proper HD
<nickstr> rather than destroy it in a microwave oven or by running it over with a car
<drf|laptop> 03I have 4 separate TSes of it
<drf|laptop> 03that I'm gonna try to delogo
<drf|laptop> 03nickstr, it'll probably be one idsc
<drf|laptop> 03*cisc
<drf|laptop> 03*DISC
<drf|laptop> 03with the movie 4 and 5, it's a flippie
<junh1024-XD> *cisc is a valid abbreviation.
<drf|laptop> 03double sided disc
<nickstr> two would make the most sense
<junh1024-XD> like, you have a CISC computer. so do most of the people here.

<Swaffy> I'm a bit tired from youth group a couple of hours ago.
<Swaffy> But wide awake regardless.
<Spyrorocks> heh
<Swaffy> I really don't like the way I've been lately on SF. I'm making myself look like an idiot on there. I'm not like that in the real-world, and I always seem to type the wrong thing.
<Swaffy> Sometimes I wish I can ban myself from it just so that I can't say anything. Almost like gluing my lips together with Gorilla glue.
<Swaffy> And yes, I do have my times where I actually show my real-world character [which is kind and Christian-like], but I hate it when I say the other stuff. I shouldn't be arguing over religion. I shouldn't. Even you can say that I've done some stupid things there.

<Ascendant> oh.
<Ascendant> wait what the hell
<Ascendant> o_O
<Ascendant> hm okay
<Ascendant> finally got through the ANNOYING process of recompiling all of islands modules
<Ascendant> oh ScriptBot
<Armageddon> now that's awesome.
<Armageddon> believe it or not that's not a vhost
<Armageddon> Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99
<Armageddon> <3
<SilverSonic> lol
<Armageddon> finaaaaaaaally works
<SilverSonic> what exactly were you trying to get to work
<Armageddon> it's reverse dns
<Armageddon> !dns tintower.ho-ohrealm.net
<Nightshadow|VNC> Resolved tintower.ho-ohrealm.net to: 64.37.49.99
<Armageddon> !dns 64.37.49.99
<Nightshadow|VNC> Resolved 64.37.49.99 to: tintower.ho-ohrealm.net
<Armageddon> :D
<Armageddon> so basically I connect with tintower.ho-ohrealm.net as my IP
<Armageddon> instead of a normal IP or ISP/server provider hostname
<Armageddon> it's a reverse DNS*
<SilverSonic> ahh
<Armageddon> [22:37:43] Testgeddon is Testgeddon@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net * Testgeddon
<Armageddon> [22:37:43] Testgeddon is using modes +iw
<Armageddon> [22:37:43] Testgeddon is connecting from *@tintower.ho-ohrealm.net 64.37.49.99
<Armageddon> the "is connecting from" bit is the user's real IP
<Armageddon> as opposed to any possible vhosts set by the server
<SilverSonic> oh
<Armageddon> so yeah
<Armageddon> <3
<Armageddon> been trying to get one for the BNC servers for ages
<Armageddon> I wish we could get one for flame
<Armageddon> and rainbow/shadow/ambernova

<HyperMetalLugia> -y
<Ascendant> dunno
<HyperMetalLugia> Fail
<Ascendant> drf showed me the email he got
<HyperMetalLugia> Now we need a new IP for it?
<Ascendant> some admin did it
<Ascendant> I commented on Arti's profile
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Ascendant> asking her to change the DNS entry of tst.lugia.us or add the island.lugia.us DNS
<Ascendant> to 67.21.84.209
<HyperMetalLugia> Baw
<HyperMetalLugia> How am I supposed to remember that?
<Ascendant> yeah it's hard to remember
<Ascendant> hopefully she'll add the DNS entries
<Ascendant> or I'll make one off my own domains
<Ascendant> but anyway, yay
<Ascendant> finally got reverse DNSes for tintower
<Ascendant> <3
<HyperMetalLugia> Does it still haver +1337 ;p
<Ascendant> yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Good
<Ascendant> nothing has changed except for the IP
<HyperMetalLugia> Such a shame :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wells
<HyperMetalLugia> Time to edit the bouncer entry
<HyperMetalLugia> !island

<Aristeo> Well, they just be hatin'
<Stormy> O_o wtf
<Espeon> 06I don't see why it wasn't obvious it was huge and such, but still.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, whining solves nothing.
<Espeon> 06I never said it was the right approach
<Espeon> 06And I never said that it's not obvious she doesn't really learn from her mistakes.
<Espeon> 06But still
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I don't think she understands the gravity of her situation.
<Espeon> 06sextuple post MUST be a new record though
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, in order to teach her, I'll take myself as an example; ban her without notification it's temporary.

<Angel_Espeon> 13brought my food with me
<Espeon> 06OR tell her in a way that she simply can't misunderstand and give her "motivation" to think through her actions next time?
<Espeon> 06And that means quite a bit coming from me. But "Without notification" is a bit wrong :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I dunno about un-misunderstanding from Haii, though.
<Espeon> 06And hi Chimera
<Chimera> 04http://www.sonicretro.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/classicDerp2ReturnOfTheDerp.png
<Chimera> 04|D
<Angel_Espeon> 13can't we just friggin' get rid of her already? :|
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Espeon> 06I have a rather strange stance on things anyway
<Espeon> 06give people chance(s), but if they don't learn then there should be "proper" consequences :B
<Espeon> 06But oh well
<Espeon> 06and bite me I'm using :B for some reason
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, about the 'without notification' part:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I feel if we say to Haii if she'll get un-banned shortly, she'll just wait it out impatiently.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Putting a serious comeuppance leads her to think about her actions.
<Espeon> 0610xPost wtf
<NightSeas> 12Lol, what the heck is haii doing? http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.0
<Shadow_Lugia> 6We've noticed. :P
<Espeon> 06And yeah, but still - "No notification" just leads to MAD and confusion
<Shadow_Lugia> 6A ban? Maybe.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But she can't do anything about it, right? :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Honestly, I don't think she even knows she's doing anything wrong, no matter how many times you warn her
<Angel_Espeon> 13:|
<NightSeas> 12lmfao "And I can't forget you, NightSeas!" in that post
<Shadow_Lugia> 6"But my popularness might ge me in BIG trouble..." <-- Ah, ha... hah.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You don't say?
<Espeon> 06AE, that's kind of obvious
<Espeon> 06The things I said = my general stance on things
<Espeon> 06She's had quite a few chances >->
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't see why we should all be forced to continue tolerating someone who won't even learn their lesson~
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Who locked the thread?

<Craiglol> 03Whoa what's wrong with her o_o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I can guess someone (tried to) explain to her?
<Craiglol> 03@ the thread
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'd say tweenage moodage.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, how's this; have the community criticize her.
<Craiglol> 03That's a pretty insane response to having a sig removed
<NightSeas> 12I think haii has some sort of disorder
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Perhaps she doesn't act different because she isn't getting any response (well, not much, mine is rather advanced for her) from other people.
<Espeon> 06"rather advanced for her"
<Espeon> 06wtf is that even supposed to mean?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Un-understandable.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6For a person her age.
<Espeon> 06Maybe it's an idea to "dumb" it down a bit then? :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I did.

<Chimera> 04Probably
<Chimera> 04But I'll be lucky if he does :|
<Espeon> 06I'd say things can be made more understandable, but fair enough. If someone seems to not understand, I just assume they're not a native English speaker AND that they're rather young.
<Espeon> 06But that's my approach
<Ray> 02Wait... E3 is a +18 event chimera...
<Ray> 02How old are you in first place? o3o...
<Chimera> 04no it's not?
<NightSeas> 12Haii is such a active user :'D
<Ray> 02Yes chime, it is. it has always been that way.
*Ray yawns
<Espeon> 06"Did you see it? xD That was funny!"
<Espeon> 06Appearently that was funny, according to Haii o.O
<Shadow_Lugia> 6O_o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6O_____o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yeah, give her a ban. ovo
<NightSeas> 12Getting banned might be funny too!
<Ray> 02^
*Ray goes to do some homework
<Espeon> 06I guess the attention was too much for her (´◉◞౪◟◉)
<HyperMetalLugia> Y U DUN BAN?!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So, what action shall we take? (Hmm, sudden serious sensation I just had.)
<HyperMetalLugia> HMM

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Want the rest of us to comment? ovo
<Aristeo> Rawr here now
<Skylands> 10I will let Arti handle this, I want her to realize that Haii deserves more than just a punishment

<Craiglol> 03Off Topic: Pony fan or not this must be watched
<Craiglol> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftvZFUg4HPc
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Wait, "more than just a punishment"?
<Damos> who's Haii
<Damos> ?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6"Someone please say something.... I'd like to hear from a Admin.... Because they are nice, and are calm..." <-- Yet she gets annoyed at them?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6"She" referring to Haii.
<Damos> oh
<Damos> what did she do?
<Skylands> 10More than just one punishment, forgot to add "one"
<Shadow_Lugia> 6http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.0
<Shadow_Lugia> 6For one.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah.
<Skylands> 10Meaning, she needs to be banned for at least a week or two
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah, wish Arti was on chat.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6She asks of Haii's age.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Haii's in 7th grade.
<NightSeas> 12So she says
<Skylands> 10I'll notify her of that
<Damos> LMFAO ARTY!
<NightSeas> 12I think she's in 3rd grade if you ask me XD
<Damos> OWNED!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I dunno, she told her school to the forums.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6And it's real school.
<Damos> uh oh
<Damos> at least lots of them don't have mIRC
<Skylands> 10I recall that, which thread was it?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm, let me check:
<Damos> GTG going to town
<NightSeas> 12I think it was in her old signature, I might be wrong though
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That could be it, NightSeas.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(WhiteTail02)03WB* - <Zoroark> 12So what? It's ok to bend the rules at times
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, Arti.
<SilverSonic> ohai Arti
<Shadow_Lugia> 6You know we've got a situation.
<NightSeas> 12Welcome back, Articuno
<WhiteTail> 12Oh?
<WhiteTail> 12Thanks!
<Damos> okay I guess I'm not going to town yet
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, you know Haii's behavior.
<Damos> hey Arty Chan
<Damos> how have you been all this time?
<WhiteTail> 12Yeh apparently she's 13 O_____o
<SilverSonic> o_O
<WhiteTail> 12and I've been super super super super busy
<WhiteTail> 12^v^
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Hi arti~
<SilverSonic> heh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, I gave ideas to the IRC on how to respond to Haii.
<NightSeas> 12I've been very busy as well, lol
<Damos> LOL you totally owned Haii with that message
<WhiteTail> 12Which one..?
<Damos> oh I think maybe the reason why she got it unlocked was because it was 'her' topic. Wasn't there an option that you can continue to post even if your topic is locked?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, if you want to hear those ideas: Group criticism and a false permanent ban.
<Skylands> 10Yes, Damos
<Damos> All I can say is..... this thread is SO ridiculous that I'm going to lock it rather than delete it so everyone can read back on it!!
<Damos> Also I don't get this, how old are you? Seriously....? Because your sig clearly said "Please read the rules". Did you read them? Of course not, that's why you have no idea why PART of your sig (that's right, NOT all of it) was removed.
<Damos> You had three very large images in your sig, I removed two and kept one. Infact I kept the Reshiram one....
<Damos> You are the one that deleted the REST of your sig, that's really, REALLY weird. All you had to do was realise that you had too many images, now you have no sig!...
<Damos> What the fish?????
*Angel_Espeon is amused by everything going on
<Damos> that one
<Espeon> 06Group criticism would hopefully not just be 15+ people going LOL UR GETTING BANNED but sadly enough that's still what I think people without enough knowledge would do .-.
<Damos> i agree
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I don't think we all feel that, right?
<SilverSonic> /
*SilverSonic has no clue what you people are on about. o3o
<Espeon> 06I mean, it's either what's needed - for her to know that it's not just "a few meanies" who realize she's not taking any advice to heart at all, OR it will just pass from one ear (or eye, whatever) to another
<Angel_Espeon> 13SS, reading Haii's topic on TST should give you an idea of what's going on :B
<SilverSonic> I'm too lazy to click
<WhiteTail> 12http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6994.msg265160#new
<WhiteTail> 12There's a direct link
<SilverSonic> i see
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Arti, what do you think?
<SilverSonic> well, after reading that randomness me is gonna finish my 30 min remix.
<WhiteTail> 12I don't understand what you mean by a false perm ban ovO
<WhiteTail> 12Didn't Aurora already try that?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Wait, what'd Rora do?
<Damos> whats false perm ban do?
<WhiteTail> 12I think she banned Haii then unbanned her a while later
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Did she notify Haii she would be un-banned?
<WhiteTail> 12Can't remember
<Angel_Espeon> 13OT but
<Angel_Espeon> 13xxLatiosxx is coming on soon
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<WhiteTail> 12Yay
<NightSeas> 12Hey Angel_Espeon :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :P
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Mmm'kay.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, back on topic:
<Shadow_Lugia> 6If Haii's under the idea she's been permanently banned from TST, then she'll think about her actions rather than wait for her un-ban.
<WhiteTail> 12I personally think she'll go on a rage about how TST sucks etc. but I guess that's pretty normal.
<Damos> oh why oh why is my iphone so slow?
<Espeon> 06Oh hi
<Damos> I just want upload a pic
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh, hey, xxLatiosxx.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, from my experience, it works. :P
*Angel_Espeon pokes xxLatiosxx

<Ray||Homeworkz> 02Hi~
<SilverSonic> hi
<Craiglol> 03Moo
<WhiteTail> 12Ok well, lets take a vote ovO who wants Haii banned?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But I'm not as... expressive as Haii might be.
<Espeon> 06And I'd expect an account like HaiiTheReshiram2 or something and/or lots of upset messages anywhere they possibly can be sent, but that's just me again :P
<Nick> o.o wow hey xxLatiosxx long time xD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6NICK.

<Damos> I made this pic of from shugo chara
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, what are the other options, Arti?
<Nick> also I'm up for giving Hai another chance
<NightSeas> 12I think Haii should get a temp ban
<SilverSonic> ^
<Damos> on the one with the angel wings
<Nick> I mean, we all start somewhere in the internet world heh
<xxLatiosxx> Oh wow, hey doods :3

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Warnings didn't help before, Night.
<xxLatiosxx> Erm, sure thing? Man I haven't been on the chat for a while so I might be a bit rusty XD

<Nick> really?
<Espeon> 06oh yes
<NightSeas> 12Yes
<Nick> soo what she do before?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm going to leave in three minutes, and return.

<Angel_Espeon> 13I dunno if this works for everything, but for my router I just log into it by typing the IP address into the address bar
<ChaoMagma> 4it knows Splash, Hidden Power, Tackle and Pound
<Angel_Espeon> 13then changing the security settings to WEP temporarily
<Angel_Espeon> 13so i can use wifi on my DS
<ChaoMagma> 4i just type in my password
*Ray||Homeworkz wants to capture a lv 100 Magikarp
*ChaoMagma 4is on GBU, Launcher Battle, Ratings
<ChaoMagma> 4just hope i find someone
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02also, Chao dsi internet options != Game internet options
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02So, you must have WEP internet
<ChaoMagma> 4y'know Ray, i bet you can connect you just don't really know how :P
<nickstr> correct
<nickstr> the Pokemon games only support WPA encryption
<ChaoMagma> 4sometimes i miss stuff that are right under my nose
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02maybe~
<ChaoMagma> 4you should connect, that way you can have Sweet Dreams~
<ChaoMagma> 4and for some reason my wi-fi isn't working right now
<Ray||Homeworkz> 02however, if you can get Pokemon Pt. to work with my internet, you'll be my best friend :3c

<Lambda> you weren't yesterday
<Neon> We had a little spat -- nothing major.

<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Stormy> OK what the heck
<Stormy> Now I can't even connect to the internet on that computer anymore
<Stormy> /nevergoingtoponychanagain
<Lambda> I blame dari
<Lambda> jk dari
<Neon> Yeah, let's blame it all on ponychan. :P
<prince-dari> :P
<Stormy> oh, and now a problem with the java updater
<Stormy> woot
<Stormy> =/
<Lambda> all of this on the netbook?
<Stormy> yes
<Stormy> what the hell, ponychan
<Aristeo> rawr!
<Stormy> what the hell
<prince-dari> What OS is that computer?
<Stormy> XP
<Neon> :O Stormy said Sheol.
<Stormy> why?
<prince-dari> Just wondering.
<Stormy> rawr...
*Stormy is having weird computer problems again...
<Neon> He wants to hazzor ur face
<Stormy> oh, well the internet connection thing is solved
<Neon> Was it the butler?
<Lambda> hmm?
<Neon> I swear, it's always the butler.
<Stormy> apparently I accidentally turned off my wireless somehow =/
*Lambda glares at dari
<Lambda> huh
<Lambda> I guess it's not the butler then
<Stormy> nope
<Neon> @dari: y u shut off wirluss!!!/1?1
<Stormy> It was Trollestia
<prince-dari> Well, the butler has to get his kicks somehow.
<prince-dari> (:
<Neon> I think you put something in our meal this evening.
<prince-dari> That's one way of putting it.
<Lambda> Stormy: and the java updater thing seems to not be working a lot actually
<Lambda> for me at least
<Stormy> yeah, I figured that could be a coincidence
<Neon> So it was the coffee he poisoned!
<Stormy> come to think of it, it's probably because it couldn't connect to the internet
<Neon> That explains the Java problem.
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> oh yeah, I suppose
<Stormy> kind of stupid of them to just have it crash though
<Lambda> Ah, good job Neon, I hadn't connected the dots that way. Now we have all the evidence against dari, I'm calling the cops.
<Neon> That's what you stepped in, that's what was on your shoe, and that explains the abarasion on your palm!
<Lambda> Stormy, it is Java, that's how they handle things going wrong xP
<Neon> Daaaamn, I'm good.

<Stormy> true
<Lambda> ILLEGAL EXCEPTION CAUGHT: Can't connect to internet for the update. Prepare for a system crash.
<Stormy> "Windows was temporarily unable to read your hard disk drive. We don't know the exact cause of the problem. In most cases, this type of condition is momentary and doesn't indicate a serious problem, but sometimes it means that a hard disk is failing. "
<Neon> Fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
<Stormy> ...
<Lambda> let's hope it's the ?in most cases? one
<Stormy> Common causes of this problem
<Stormy> Aging or failing hard disks. To prevent file corruption and data loss, we recommend that you back up all of your important files and folders immediately. See step 1 in the section below for more information.
<Stormy> Large file transfers from secondary media, such as an external hard drive, to a local hard drive.
<Stormy> Loss of power to a hard disk drive that causes inconsistent data sectors.
<Stormy> Hard disk-intensive processes such as antivirus scanners.
<Stormy> Recently installed hardware that might have compatibility and performance problems.
<Lambda> *"in most cases"
<Neon> Do you think that hard disk failure was the reason for Plessy v. Ferguson?
<Stormy> Nowhere does it say "Annoying audio loops on ponychan"
<Lambda> that makes it sound like it may have to do with the AVG update
<prince-dari> I can haz all secret ponychan boards.
<Neon> Stormy, it does say thatin the fine print.,
<Neon> *that in
<Stormy> I only updated AVG on my other computer

<Ascendant> derp
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, 50% ?
<Spyrorocks> safe bet lol
<Spyrorocks> it seems like an odd question.

<Stormy> And "50% or less" is the lowest option

<Stormy> it's multiple choice
<Light_Latias> laa
<Spyrorocks> what job are you applying for
<Stormy> Target
<junh1024-XD> sou
<Spyrorocks> ah
<Stormy> I'd only be there for like three months until school starts again
<Spyrorocks> is it 50% or less or 50% or more?
<Spyrorocks> what options
<Stormy> 1 . 95% to 100% 2 . 90% to 94% 3 . 75% to 89% 4 . 50% to 74% 5 . Less than 50%
<Light_Latias> faa
<Umbreon> 12hi Light_Latias
<Umbreon> 12how goes XD
<Light_Latias> hai Umbreon
<Light_Latias> early shift sandwich .-.
<Light_Latias> 9am today and tomorrow
<Light_Latias> today meaning earlier
<Spyrorocks> I wonder what reason they could have to ask that
<Spyrorocks> I know some jobs ask you a silly question or two
<Spyrorocks> but its meant to check out your ability to think critically
<Light_Latias> yous?
<Stormy> This questionnaire is completely filled with stupid questions
<Stormy> There's one that asks about how tactful you are
<Stormy> And more that ask about how happy you are with your life
<Spyrorocks> "How many items have you stolen from target in the past?"
<Spyrorocks> "How many do you plan on stealing while employed here?"
<Stormy> lol
<Lambda> that sounds like a typically application question, but as for how many politicians you trust, I dunno about that one
<Stormy> why do they even bother asking that?
<Lucia> dead tonight
<Lambda> *typical
<Spyrorocks> I would sue and say its discrimination!
<Spyrorocks> against politicians!
<Umbreon> 12i'm becoming a booknerd D:
<Umbreon> 12to an extent
<Stormy> totally
<Light_Latias> XD
<Light_Latias> watcha reading?
<Spyrorocks> and against percentages!
<Umbreon> 12i wanted to get rid of all my stephen king books that i never read
<Stormy> Maybe that could pay for my tuition instead of working
<Spyrorocks> hahaha
<Light_Latias> ah
<Umbreon> 12so i took them to this place that exchanges books for credit and with the credit i bought like half the animorph series
<Light_Latias> lolz
<Stormy> Oh, now it wants to know about my grades in high school
<Spyrorocks> well just chose some midground in the politicans question
<Umbreon> 12which was all the copies they had
<Umbreon> 12not counting doubles
<Spyrorocks> you dont trust them all but you dont think everything they say are lies
<Stormy> yeah
<Umbreon> 12i already am half way into #1
<Stormy> Pretty much all I can do if I don't know what they're looking for
<Spyrorocks> you should scan that application id like to see it

<Umbreon> 12It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoriant effects from eating capsaicin-flavored foods. Folklore among self-described "chiliheads" attributes this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. In support of this theory, there is some evidence that the effect can be blocked by naloxone and other compounds that

<junh1024-XD> drfsupercenter, if i turn off HT. will you turn off HT?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<Umbreon> 12wow that's awesome so it's true
<Umbreon> 12parts of bruce almighty was filmed in the same set of back to the future
<junh1024-XD> because if i'm advising you to do it, i'd better put my money where my mouth is.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not going to mess with my CPU >_> <_<
<nickstr> you already fudged with it
<junh1024-XD> it's not messing with your CPU
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, wtf?
<nickstr> plus you gain nothing from hyper threading
<drfsupercenter> 03I just put it in the socket
<drfsupercenter> 03that's all
<junh1024-XD> it's called turning off a BIOS setting. its completely safe.
<nickstr> if anything you LOSE performance
<junh1024-XD> you'r not messing with voltage or megahurts.
<junh1024-XD> it just how the OS manages & sees the CPU. thats all.
<drfsupercenter> 03I like having hyperthreading.
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf, since when do i3s hyperthread
<junh1024-XD> since 2009
<junh1024-XD> If it's the "if it crashes it only crashes to 12.5%" "reason", thats the lamest excuse, and it's not as beneficial as you think.
<junh1024-XD> if you can give me a sensible reason, fine
<drfsupercenter> 03that it's my CPU and I don't feel like modifying settings?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd be more interested in a setting that makes eSATA actually work
<drfsupercenter> 03as right now it doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03even though I have it in AHCi mode
<nickstr> that excuse is lame
<nickstr> so what
<junh1024-XD> your i7 also has this turbo thing, iirc
<nickstr> that "12.5%" really IS 25%
<nickstr> if not more
<drfsupercenter> 03I dunno, but I do know that my 2.8GHz i7 gets the same performance score as my 3.2GHz quad core AMD
<drfsupercenter> 03so it obviously performs better
<junh1024-XD> under what conditions?
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows Experience Index.
<junh1024-XD> b00
<nickstr> that is not exactly a good benchmarking utility
<junh1024-XD> it's at a max. of 25%, mb a bit less because of switching time, because it can't stride more than 1 physical core. but the extra heat generation doesn't quite register in this metric
<junh1024-XD> soyea,
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<nickstr> well here is yet another way the SPP forums FAIL
<nickstr> no custom avatar options
<nickstr> its annoying
<nickstr> especially if you made your own and would like to use is
<nickstr> *it
<nickstr> I made this really nice custom animated avatar which is something you don't see much
<Umbreon> 12i wanna make an avatar relating to pokemon vietnamese crystal
<nickstr> you can't use it on the SPP forum
<nickstr> I am not sure about the one here though
<Umbreon> 12i'm not part of SPP
<Umbreon> 12so i don't care
<nickstr> you don't want to be
<nickstr> its a war zone
<junh1024-XD> so is bulba
<nickstr> but to a lesser extent
<nickstr> not much less though
<junh1024-XD> so are, many other pokemon forums because
<junh1024-XD> >pokemon
<nickstr> you know about as well as I that Pokemon's fan base is polarized
<nickstr> especially the anime fan base
<Umbreon> 12there is no such thing as an internet utopia
<Umbreon> 12there is no such thing as a utopia
<Umbreon> 12an
<nickstr> some smaller forums come close but that is true
<Umbreon> 12smaller forums with a strict user acceptance will come close
<Umbreon> 12but they all eventually meet their end
<nickstr> so the spitty forums will live on yet the good ones will die
<nickstr> in your mind
<Umbreon> 12the spitty forums live on because they have a gigantic fanbase supporting it
<Umbreon> 12even though they are corrupted
<nickstr> I can't say it because of the epic failure that is +G
<Umbreon> 12lol
<Umbreon> 12the pattern i have seen
<Umbreon> 12is the more people become aware of a community, the more it falls
<nickstr> I actually fought long and hard to keep +G from being set on another forum's IRC channel
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Umbreon> 12+G is a big deal?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> if you have an overzealous op who turns it into a kick/kill script like what happened here
<Umbreon> 12so people aren't allowed to swear and swearing is met with negative reinforcement
<nickstr> this tended to cause problems as the server actually confused some words for what was in its list of stuff to be blocked
<nickstr> the overzealous op's script automatically kicked people when they cursed
<nickstr> which resulted in kicks being a regular thing
<Umbreon> 12so you're saying the swear filter isn't perfect?
<nickstr> yes
<nickstr> the curse filter is highly flawed
<Umbreon> 12i don't think i ever seen that happen here
<nickstr> it happened quite a bit
<nickstr> computers are not perfect
<nickstr> they do make mistakes
<nickstr> and they do end up with false matches
<Umbreon> 12it's only common sense
<Umbreon> 12computers are a creation of man
<Umbreon> 12which we ourselves are flawed
<nickstr> plus you have to live with the fact that cursing is everywhere
<nickstr> especially in this day and age
<Umbreon> 12cursing is everywhere
<Umbreon> 12but that doesn't mean it should be invited with open warms
<Umbreon> 12"oh swearing happens everywhere, okay swear as much as you want"
<nickstr> I am not saying to invite it
<nickstr> I am saying that you should live with the fact that it exists
<Umbreon> 12i know it exists
<Umbreon> 12a person at my bus stop for school used to swear ever 5 seconds
<Umbreon> 12it drove me nuts
<nickstr> plus the way I see it if you don't drop the F bomb all the time then its tolerable
<Umbreon> 12i completely agree in front of the right audience
<Umbreon> 12swearing can be used to express true anger but when you use it every 5 seconds it just loses it's meaning
<Umbreon> 12it's nothing but an empty word then
<nickstr> I use cursing to express anger and that is about it
<nickstr> the "swear" thing sounds like something a 5 or 10 year old would say
<nickstr> and I refuse to say that
<Umbreon> 12?
<nickstr> because it just seems childish
<Umbreon> 12what does?
<nickstr> calling cursing "swearing"
<Umbreon> 12sigh
<Umbreon> 12both ways are valid

<lightumbreon|Starcraft2> ew...get well soon
<eXAKR> Must be something I ate
<eXAKR> Reminder to self: never trust dad's dishwashing for anything

<Angel_Espeon> 13Ew
<Angel_Espeon> 13I consider myself the best dishwasher in my house |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13my dad doesn't really wash the dishes much, and my mum sometimes doesn't clean them properly
<Angel_Espeon> 13so :B
<eXAKR> I complained to my dad that this is giving me problems
<eXAKR> He shoots back with, "then why I don't get it?"
<eXAKR> Spoiler: back in his younger days, when Singapore = third-world backwater, and nearly everybody lived in villages, he ate food out of trash cans and had parasites in him
<eXAKR> (Major ew, I know)

<lightumbreon|Starcraft2> o.ô

<eXAKR> He never seemed to depart from the ways of village living
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> hmm
<eXAKR> I have gotten into arguments with my dad over his hygeine countless times
<eXAKR> I have mostly given up
<eXAKR> I have learned to work around his ways, mostly
<Angel_Espeon> 13You know what would be a good idea? Washing the dishes yourself :B
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol, silly next door neighbour is attempting to set up a trampoline outside in the rain
<lightumbreon|Starcraft2> hehe xD
<lightumbreon|Starcraft2> YESH! i just got word from the tag company, my nametag is sended, i will recieve it tommorow :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13is it just me or is youtube being dodgy right now?
<eXAKR> Angel_Espeon: I'm doing that
<eXAKR> but for cooking instruments I leave it to him, since I trust the heat to kill the bacteria
<eXAKR> Next time I'm doing the dishes myself though
<eXAKR> He usually complains that I use too much water and soap
<eXAKR> Well, he uses too little of it <<
<eXAKR> Damn my ISP hates BitTorrent

<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<HyperMetalLugia> Good luc
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03np
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF has no life
<drfsupercenter> 03waid why did I just say np
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<drfsupercenter> 03HML LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03you do realize I'm logging the chat whether I'm away or not :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I just never disconnect unless my connection forces me off
<drfsupercenter> 03yay having two monitors?
<Dialga> if being "still here" is leaving for some 9 months or so then coming back then sure
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :P
<drfsupercenter> 03My right one is pretty much only used for IRC
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup
<Damos> finally
<drfsupercenter> 03in a couple days
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll have my new monitors
<Damos> Arty here it is
<drfsupercenter> 03two 1080p ones
<Damos> http://pokedamos.deviantart.com/art/Angel-Cradle-208599815
<drfsupercenter> 03LED backlit
<HyperMetalLugia> Goodness
<drfsupercenter> 03it's gonna be awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil
<drfsupercenter> 03these are only 19"
<Dialga> i have 2 monitors but one is huge and sits on my desk all day doing nothing because it's pretty bad
<HyperMetalLugia> How many in?
<drfsupercenter> 0321.5
<lightumbreon> wow DAmos, that's really pretty!
<drfsupercenter> 03the smallest they make 1080p
<drfsupercenter> 03which means it'll have really sharp picture
<Damos> thanks
<Damos> ^^
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah, I have a 23 and 22ish monitor (can't use/steal the 22 in since I have no desk space left)
<HyperMetalLugia> Go HD monitors
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I was reluctant to get ones any bigger
<HyperMetalLugia> Why?
<drfsupercenter> 03because I at one point had a 20" 16:9 as well as my 19"
<drfsupercenter> 03and it started hurting my neck
<HyperMetalLugia> Stretching ;P
<drfsupercenter> 03as it was too wide
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf stretching?
<drfsupercenter> 03you just set the resolution properly :P
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> I know :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03my desk is only so big and I sit close
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I have a 2nd monitor that is only 17in and 5:4 XD
<HyperMetalLugia> So much easier
<Dialga> that's why i wouldn't like a hueg monitor
<Dialga> 21" would be about how big i'd go
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Damos> drf should get a plasma screen computer
<Dialga> but i'm used to my 17" so yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I figured half an inch won't hurt
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Damos
<Damos> no a theater sized
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't make plasma smaller than 42"
<drfsupercenter> 03and um
<HyperMetalLugia> TVs as computer
<drfsupercenter> 03that would majorly hurt
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03that's actually sucky
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a 50" TV
<drfsupercenter> 03that's 1080p
<HyperMetalLugia> Stretching
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll have a 21.5" monitor that's 1080p
<HyperMetalLugia> And big pixels
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03which do you think will have a better picture
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Damos> Strechy
<Damos> Strechy
<drfsupercenter> 03and WTF is it with you and stretching HML
<drfsupercenter> 03if you use a computer you don't get stretching unless you're stupid
<Damos> he's working out
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, I used a 32in 720P monitor
<HyperMetalLugia> For my laptop once
<HyperMetalLugia> It looked bad, since it was 720 XD
<Dialga> 1440 x 900 is good enough
*Damos sees HML strech reeeealy long
<Dialga> that's my laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop is 1680x1060 ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<drfsupercenter> 031050
<HyperMetalLugia> I have 1280x800
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's 15.4"
*lightumbreon stretches out and yawns
<Dialga> because go die drf i hate you
<drfsupercenter> 03yes my 15.4" laptop has a bigger screen resolution than my 19" desktop monitor :|
<HyperMetalLugia> And then 1280x1024 for my laptop's 2nd monitor
<HyperMetalLugia> Shave
<HyperMetalLugia> (At home)
<Dialga> i could set my CRT to many resoluion i wanted
<Dialga> but i never use it
<Dialga> and it's just kind of there
<Dialga> i don't think i'll ever dual-monitor
<HyperMetalLugia> I never use higher than that on my CRT XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Since it looks ugly ish
<Damos> I'm going to Kings island tommorow with the school
<Dialga> i used 1186 x 364 or something like that when i used that CRt with my desktop
<Dialga> er
<Dialga> 864
<Dialga> 364 pixels high
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom still uses 1024x768 on her CRT

<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<HyperMetalLugia> Almost as bad as the Wii
<Damos> it was origonally for clubs only. I wasn't in them. But I was joking around by asking my teacher and she took it seriously and said yes
<Dialga> my parents use a 1024x768 LCD
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh wait

<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm the kind of person who's better at drawing the characters rather than the backgrounds xD

<HyperMetalLugia> Same

<Damos> land scape drawing and painting are no different than aanime drawing
<drfsupercenter> 03I consider myself good at music
<drfsupercenter> 03I've made a bunch of different edits/remixes
<Damos> you draw with your style and heart as well as with your rythme
<HyperMetalLugia> Angry birds
<Dialga> i'm pretty good at playing instruments that make music
<HyperMetalLugia> Weird game
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol Damos, to me I think that drawing characters and drawing landscapes are completely different xD

<Shadow_Lugia> 6I actually got defeated the third time through due to a weakness to Fighting types on my team. ovo
<Shadow_Lugia> 6But then again, my team's not, well, the 'optimal' one.
<Espeon> 06Why not?
<eXAKR> "Dear passengers, if you do not have an optimal Pokémon team, please refrain from boarding the Battle Subway. Thank you."

<eXAKR> How does one get a Scolipede on the trains anyway
<eXAKR> Those things are huge
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't even realise that half the Pokemon I'd brought with me were weak to bug-types |D
<Shadow_Lugia> 6How do you get, say, a Gyarados?
<lightumbreon|LightLugia> ew...thats a good one
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I've heard that you can cheat the AI system with enough fast pokemon with Destiny Bond.

<lightumbreon|LightLugia> Gnite :3
<Chimera> 04Oh wow.
<Chimera> 04Guess what guys.
<Chimera> 04Most of Black and White's sprites are the size of the screen from left to right.
<Chimera> 04That is, the sprites themselves, including transparency.
<HyperMetalLugia> 0.o
<HyperMetalLugia> And that means
<HyperMetalLugia> They're fat
<Shadow_Lugia> 6They're 96 x 96, right?
<Chimera> 04nope
<Chimera> 04256 x 128
<Chimera> 04Those are the size of the images
<Chimera> 04the sprites themselves might be that size, but the sprites are actually a bunch of seperated parts.
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<Chimera> 04All animated seperately.
<HyperMetalLugia> Doing the old SNES trick
<HyperMetalLugia> Good old nintendo
<HyperMetalLugia> 16 bit to be less nintendoy
<Chimera> 04It works ;P
<HyperMetalLugia> Giant Bosses?!
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<HyperMetalLugia> Just tons of sprites
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet nobody notices :P
<Chimera> 04And the only thing that involves 16 is the sprite palletes.
<Chimera> 04Seriously
<Chimera> 04you STILL can only use 16 colors in your sprites! X_X
<HyperMetalLugia> O>o
<HyperMetalLugia> Does the SNES have more ;P
<Chimera> 04I mean, those 16 colors can be any colors at all, but still
<Chimera> 04only 16 colors per sprite.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ah, well just fail
<Chimera> 04kinda
<HyperMetalLugia> Amazing that the sprites look good
<HyperMetalLugia> Imagine..8bit colour sprites
<HyperMetalLugia> Now those would be nice
<Chimera> 04out of the 765 possible pixel colors, only 16 of them are usable on each sprite
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The sprites themselves are really getting lower quality. :/
<Chimera> 04Hur
<Chimera> 04not exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> Kinda
<Chimera> 04It was the animation that killed it
<HyperMetalLugia> But the animation
<HyperMetalLugia> Agreeded
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6No, not the animation.
<Chimera> 04The quality was nice
<Chimera> 04yes
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The SHADING. :U
<Chimera> 04o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> Shading O.o
<Chimera> 04oh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Reshiram has, like, only 5 colors in it.
<Chimera> 04um
<Chimera> 04no
<Chimera> 04wait
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Not including the eye.
<Chimera> 04haha
<eXAKR> !chimera
*Chimera now belongs to eXAKR for 3 minutes
<Chimera> 04It uses 12
<Chimera> 04out of 16
<Chimera> 04XD
<Chimera> 04Guess you're right, then.
<Chimera> 04The eye makes up one color
<Chimera> 04The fire two
<Chimera> 04wait no four
<Chimera> 046 colors make up its WHITENESS
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm, speaking of, do you know any people who have those 'secondary' panels from a sprite?
<Chimera> 04huh?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The sprites are animated, though most uploaders only show the primary panel or the whole animation.
<Chimera> 04http://www.spriters-resource.com/ds/pokemonblackwhite/reshiramani.png
<Shadow_Lugia> 6O_o
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Long animation...?
<Skylands> 10...
<Chimera> 04yep
<Chimera> 04the animation itself is but the data is probably short.
<SilverSonic> Hai Sky
<Chimera> 04It just tells the sprites to play a certain way for x amount of times, and tells another sprite to appear/disappear, replace itself...
<Chimera> 04And those can have seperate timeframes.
<Chimera> 04It's basically pixellated Flash |D

<Nick> *sighs* I want celebi ;_;
<ChaoMagma> 4what do you need?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not EV training in White at all until I get Pokerus
<Quanyails> 7Every Power item. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Which I should be getting at some point eventually
<Quanyails> 7And AE, I can give you a pokemon with it.
<ChaoMagma> 4*gasp* Pokerus!
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D Really?
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's all i'm waiting for at the moment xD

<Nick> I got a better name for it
<Nick> the P-Virus, has a resident evil tone to it don't it?
*Nick runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have Pokerus in HeartGold, but I lack two DS's to transfer it across xD

<Quanyails> 7Want me or Umbry to trade?
<ChaoMagma> 4does Quanyails have multiple Pokerus?

<ChaoMagma> 4*_*
<Quanyails> 7So, what are you trading in return?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll see what I've got, though I'll be honest and say I probably don't have anything particularly amazing to give in return ^^;
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Quanyails> 7I'd really like a Power item. :P
*ChaoMagma 4is ready
<Quanyails> 7o.o

<Angel_Espeon> 13I have enough BP to afford one, but I'll get one for you if you want :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I go to the Battle Subway fairly often anyway xD
<Quanyails> 7Aw, thanks. :3

<HyperMetalLugia> not at all
<HyperMetalLugia> This is a ghost
<Aristeo> oooooooooooooooooooo
<Aristeo> oooo
<HyperMetalLugia> From the past
<Cat> the terrain is from the mod project I work on
<Aristeo> o
<Aristeo> ooooo
<Aristeo> I approve!
<Cat> the main game's land can be seen in the far distance
<NoizeSpiral> damn i almost forgot about that game
<where> :o
<where> I should play that.
<Cat> this is the city down below http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9812/mgescreenshot6.jpg
<where> I need a long period of time where I can sit down and do nothing but Morrowind, though!
<Cat> and this is the ash swamp down at the bottom http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/1286/mgescreenshot22.jpg
<where> Cat, do you know of any good mods that make the combat suck ass a little less?
<where> er
<Aristeo> mmmmmmmmmm
<where> I mean be less bad
<where> <.<
<Cat> the combat isn't that bad is it?
<where> It's awful
<where> The screenshots are not, though~
<where> !
<Kosoveon> wb Sheena
<Cat> yeah, the wonders of the Morrowind Graphics Extender :p
<SheenaFox> thanks Kosoveon
<SheenaFox> back from a friends house
<SheenaFox> ate all his food
<SheenaFox> like we do at all of our friends houses :D
<where> I have an urge to play an old game
<Kosoveon> what kind of food? :P
<Cat> I took this one http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/MGE%20Screenshot%2067%20%282%29.jpg
<where> But I have no idea what
<SheenaFox> I ate a slice of his pound cake
<where> Cool!
<SheenaFox> everyone ate crakers with cheese and salami |D
<NoizeSpiral> i stopped playing that game
<Kosoveon> pound cake....<3
<NoizeSpiral> because of the repetative combat
<SheenaFox> Lemon pound cake :D
<SheenaFox> I'm surprised I'm not fat |D
<Cat> I always tend to play mages
<Kosoveon> oh yes
<Kosoveon> XD
<NoizeSpiral> tough the rpg is awesome itself
<where> it's not that it was repetitive
<Cat> which are slightly less repetitive
<NoizeSpiral> the combat etc is very dull
<where> it's just plain horrible
<where> Well, I suppose you do do nothing but spam left click
<Cat> the combat isn't so bad once you have higher skill in a weapon
<NoizeSpiral> same for the magic effects
<NoizeSpiral> end game it's rediculas
<where> I do think that Skyrim will be pretty cool though
<NoizeSpiral> like flying around jumping into the sky
<Cat> I like flying and teleporting about
<NoizeSpiral> stuff like that
<Cat> but I never get very high level
<Cat> I think highest I ever got was like 22
<Drake> 04Question: Does anyone know how I could find my Wii's console number?
<NoizeSpiral> i played that game some years ago
<NoizeSpiral> all the way trough
<NoizeSpiral> end game was way to boring
<NoizeSpiral> tbh that game is all about the story/ role play
*Quanyails 7shrugs. :/
<NoizeSpiral> nothing else really
<Cat> I like exploring
<Quanyails> 7I wish DreamMagma was here.
<Kosoveon> I'd tell you but I sold my wii XD;
<Kosoveon> best I can say is go to wii settings, it's in there
<Cat> which is why I like the mod I work on (Tamriel Rebuilt)
<Quanyails> 7I've noticed different pokemon, when you meet them at Entralink, have different animations.
<Quanyails> 7Natu spins around and around. O.o
<Cat> the name is something of a Misnomer as we're only working on getting the mainland of Morrowind in
<Cat> but it's still a heck of a lot of extra terrain, interiors and quests
<where> Hurry up and do everywhere else!
<Cat> I'm pretty sure we're intending to only do Morrowind
<Cat> other projects have taken up the mantle for other provinces
<where> Hurry up and do everywhere else!
<Drake> 04Dammit
<Cat> imma start up the CS and do some work on the bits I'm currently making
<Cat> I should also get this big box of coke into the fridge
<Cat> I should totally do a livestream of me doing some CS work at some point
<Cat> that kind of thing is possible, right?

<Mikey> D:
<Lambda> we sell Pokemon stuff at work
<Lambda> I'm tryigg to work up the courage to ask my boss if I can buy one
<Lambda> :P
<Mikey> XDD
<Mikey> well if you say you wanna buy it and not just take it for free I'm sure you can
<Lambda> yeah, people who work there have bought stuff before
<Lambda> but you have to go through a whole process of arranging it
<Mikey> ...D:

<Lambda> oh yeah could do that
<Lambda> or say it's for my girlfriend

<eXAKR> a shed, without proper safety measures. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket and stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the pretty blue-green light that the substances gave off in the dark.[34]"

<drfsupercenter> 03XZD

<drfsupercenter> 03because I seriously had like 3 parts of Portal 2 ruined for me by TST >_>
<Mikey> LOL
<Mikey> HOW DID YOU FIND THAT
<Lambda> this website that I go to where people post random stuff
<eXAKR> One of tghese days I'm going to do the Cave Johnson lemon rant in public
<Lambda> someone posted it when they realized their neighbor does this every morning
<drfsupercenter> 03Good job breaking it, hero.
<Mikey> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Articuno02)03WB* - <Zoroark> 12So what? It's ok to bend the rules at times
<drfsupercenter> 03woah hi
<Articuno> 12Hi ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03either you're up early, I'm up late, or both

<Lambda> ever
<Lambda> again
<Articuno> 12Yeh I'm up stupidly early on a Saturday >v>;
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03we've been best friends since we were like 8
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, and Arti, I got new monitors ^^
<drfsupercenter> 031080p ones
<Lambda> well apparently he plays black eyed peas music loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear when he does it so he must be
<drfsupercenter> 03but thanks to them being LED backlit it's like STARING INTO THE SUN LOL
<Lambda> I think
<Mikey> I GOTTA FEELING he's on drugs
<Articuno> 12Wow
<Articuno> 12Awesome!
<Lambda> I mean I DON'T see how it's badass, but for him maybe
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> must be
<drfsupercenter> 03though there's some crap to work out
<Articuno> 12I want LED screens
<drfsupercenter> 3Video: S211HL (Analog) on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 SE (1920x1080x32bpp 60Hz)
<drfsupercenter> 03like how that says analog
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm using DVI >_>
<Lambda> OH
<Articuno> 12Lol
<eXAKR> I want combustible lemons
<Lambda> I SEE WHAT YOU DID THAR
<drfsupercenter> 03and supposedly these monitors do 75Hz but... it's not letting me actually set that
<Lambda> took me a second to catch that
<Articuno> 12Well apparently LEDs are easily on the eyes when playing dark coloured games
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm thinking I'll just remove all my video drivers and reinstall them
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Mikey> ...wow :P
<Lambda> good one :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, so far the colors have been really good compared to my old ones
<Articuno> 12How much for one?
<drfsupercenter> 03I have the brightness at 25%, when I first turned them on and they were at 100%, OMFG
<drfsupercenter> 03$130
<drfsupercenter> 0321.5"
<drfsupercenter> 03which is the smallest they make 1080
<Articuno> 12Awesome!!
<Lambda> this is what someone suggest the person who posted this video should do
<Lambda> Step 1: Zip-line.
<Lambda> Step 2: Ninja costume.
<Lambda> Step 3: Zip-line into his yard in ninja costume.
<Lambda> Step 4: Make his fucking day.
<drfsupercenter> 03the only thing I'm gonna have to get used to is how light my IRC color looks on here
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm used to it being darker due to a crap monitor
<drfsupercenter> 03my old one had a 500:1 contrast ratio, this advertises having about a million to one
<eXAKR> wtf
<eXAKR> Why is there a strand of cat fur on my pants
<drfsupercenter> 03who knowsxz
<drfsupercenter> 03-x
<Articuno> 12I can't think of cats without thinking of Nyan Cat XD

<drfsupercenter> 03I pretty much get all my news regarding copyright crap from Digital Video Forums
<Articuno> 12We get it from Fark
<Articuno> 12Which usually gets it from places like that lol
<drfsupercenter> 03holy crap
<drfsupercenter> 03Leaked presentation slides reveal that the Xbox 360 is about to get its next major update on May 19, dubbed the "Spring Update". The Xbox 360 dashboard often gets a major update around this time of the year, hence the term "Spring Update", but this latest update may not add as much as gamers will hope for.
<drfsupercenter> 03The major feature in this update, and the only "user facing" new feature, appears to be PayPal supported, tentatively linked to Microsoft's recent purchase of Skype (both Skype and PayPal used to be owned by eBay). Gamers will be able to use PayPal to pay for all their gaming services in the future.
<drfsupercenter> 03Being able to use PayPal will actually be REALLY USEFUL for me
<drfsupercenter> 03Not included in the update is Avatar Kinect, which is launching separately on May 27. Microsoft also recently launched Hulu Plus for the Xbox 360, and before that, Netflix Kinect support. <- OK Avatar Kinect wtf
<Articuno> 12OMG yeh ovO
<Articuno> 12I <3 Paypal
<drfsupercenter> 03I like video kinecting with LL without having those silly avatars in the way :P
<Articuno> 12lol

<drfsupercenter> 03let's see how huge the folder is

<pattyrick> Even though we can't fly by ourselves, our highly intelligent minds can build things to solve all kinds of problems.
<pattyrick> For example, as I said before we can't fly by ourselves.
<Ascendant> Ah, highly intelligent. So that's how the beings themselves put it as. I understand.
<pattyrick> In 1903, the Wright Bothers built the first airplane into the air.
<pattyrick> Goldfish probably think they're intelligent, too.
*pattyrick hides
<Ascendant> But they have such short term memory they forget they're intelligent after 5 seconds.
<pattyrick> Goldfish actually have slightly longer memory than that.
<pattyrick> I heard the same, but it's actually a few minutes I think
<pattyrick> I can look it up
<pattyrick> Forgive me for using Wikipedia, but here's something on it
<pattyrick> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish#Intelligence
<Ascendant> Well, they forget they're intelligent after that time frame, then.

<Ascendant> particularly Soyuz
<Ray> 02hmm...
<Ascendant> hm lolwut
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ascendant> someone explain to me
<Drake> 04ohlol Morrowind
<Ascendant> why most people think I'm scary
<Ascendant> I don't bite...much
<Drake> 04Awesome gam-
<Ascendant> okay that's not true
<Ascendant> but
<Drake> 04You're kidding right?
<Ascendant> how am I scary?
<Espeon> 06I only bite if people like that kind of thing
<Drake> 04Right?
<Espeon> 06I mean
*Espeon flop
<Drake> 04XD
<Ascendant> not kidding Drake
<Drake> 04You can be intimidating NS, because you're so blunt.
<Espeon> 06pft
<Ascendant> intimidating != scary though
<Ascendant> okay
<Ascendant> that's kinda not true
<Ascendant> but I'm not scary on the Hensh-level
<Ascendant> :x
<Espeon> 06It's kind of sad that people being blunt is "intimidating" nowadays
<Ascendant> yeah
<pattyrick> Agreed
<Drake> 04Yah
<pattyrick> Random fact of the day: I was born in the same city as the lead singer of Paramore: Meridian, Mississippi
<Drake> 04Awesome
<Drake> 04Haley Williams.
<pattyrick> Yup :3
<Drake> 04Spelling?
<pattyrick> I think that's correct
<Drake> 04k
<Drake> 04Paramore is cool
<Ascendant> I was born into the same world as myself.
<pattyrick> That's pretty awesome.
<Ascendant> Totally makes sense.
<pattyrick> What world is that?
<Drake> 04I was born into a hospital.
<Drake> 04Amazing isn't it?
<pattyrick> It is.
<lightumbreon> i was born out of my mother
<pattyrick> Wait, you weren't born in an airplane?
<Drake> 04No, I wasn't. Weird isn't it?
<pattyrick> It is
<Ascendant> Wait Drake, you weren't born stupid? Damn, then how are you still smart?
<pattyrick> If you were, where would you be considered to have been born?
<Ascendant> /sense
<Drake> 04XD
<pattyrick> xD
<Ascendant> I have logic.
<Drake> 04I would have been born in Flight Number J367
*Drake shot
<pattyrick> I was born like any regular American.
<pattyrick> In a hospital...
<Espeon> 06I was born like any Norwegian. On a polar bear with skis on my legs
<pattyrick> Except for the ones born in a car, plane, or any other place.
<Espeon> 06The ironic part is that I can't even ski so
<Espeon> 06:D
*Espeon dies
<Drake> 04XD
<pattyrick> xD
<lightumbreon> LOL
<Ascendant> [21:25:23] <Drake> I would have been born in Flight Number J367
<Ascendant> [21:25:25] * Drake shot
<Ascendant> you'd be born on flight 34
<Ascendant> or 69
<Espeon> 06ohnoyoudidnt
<Drake> 04I probably would
<Espeon> 06.jpg
<lightumbreon> i was born like any other Dutch guy.......in a mill
<Ascendant> derp
<pattyrick> brb
<Espeon> 06Mkay
<Drake> 04We were born like any other people - on Earth.
<Drake> 04/end
<Ascendant> derp
<lightumbreon> YOU WERE BORN ON EARTH DRAKE?!
<Drake> 04WEIRD RIGHT?

<lightumbreon> not as cute, right?
<eXAKR> I'm not even into Spyro the Dragon

<eXAKR> This sucks
<Drake> 04Spyro in DotD was bad
<Drake> 04but this
<Drake> 04is
<Drake> 04impossible
<Drake> 04I think they're just trying to maul him as much as possible.
<eXAKR> I'm going to just watch eagles floofing in their nest
<eXAKR> http://www.ustream.tv/decoraheagles

<Articuno> 12Yeh I broke something
<Ascendant> I do that all the time
*Ascendant points at ScriptBot
<Articuno> 12Also I'm experimenting a tiny bit
<Ascendant> Ah
<Armageddon> o_o
<Articuno> 12thats how it broke XD
<Ascendant> lmao
<pattyrick> I've broken roller coasters by taking pictures of them.
<Ascendant> I try to keep backups...actually I don't
<Ascendant> :x
<Articuno> 12I have a one click backup restore system, but it's failed today when Ineeded it most :/ so I'm onto Support
<Ascendant> Also thanks for adding the DNSes and such XD
<Ascendant> Ah :|
<Ascendant> What do you think caused the problem?
<Articuno> 12No idea, was in the middle of a transaction, cancelled it, then nothing would work after that. XD
*SilverSonic has awakened
<lightumbreon> heya SS :3
<SilverSonic> *yawns* Hello Everyone :3
<pattyrick> Hey SS! =D
<Ascendant> ...XD
<Ascendant> I have no idea then
<Ascendant> although, I haven't broken SMF that much to have to ask for support
<Espeon> 06oo
<Articuno> 12It's not SmF that's broken ovO
<Ascendant> o_O?
<Articuno> 12It's my one click restore module on Cpanel XD
<Ascendant> ...oh lmaaaaaaaaao
<Articuno> 12See this is why we need a new server
<Ascendant> I have a few
<Articuno> 12I hate having to rely on support
<Ascendant> You could also probably ask drf if you could use his IRC's server website thing
<Articuno> 12Nah we've got a new server
<Articuno> 12it's just installing and configuring CPanel etc. takes ages
<Articuno> 12But when we set it up, we can fix anything that breaks instead of having to ask the support people
<Ascendant> yeah cpanel takes ages to configure
<Ascendant> whmcs is worse though
<Ascendant> :x
*pattyrick wishes he understood more about computers and servers.
<lightumbreon> xD
<Ascendant> and whm's firewall is the most annoying thing ever
<Ascendant> heh pattyrick, go wikipedia it :x
<pattyrick> Ok
<pattyrick> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_servers Thurrr you have it.
<Ascendant> go download apache, attempt to set up, ???, PROFIT

<Ascendant> instead of using the command on you
<Ascendant> it'd be a hell lot of easier and would reduce the script by about 60 lines :x
<pattyrick> Ok
<Ascendant> dunno, no one ever gives me feedback or suggestions
<Ascendant> so I don't know what people want :x

<lightumbreon|BBL> i have it fo my dad's his sites ;.;
<Ascendant> TST uses joomla too lol
<lightumbreon> ew.....
<SilverSonic> lol
<Ascendant> and joomla can be the most annoying thing ever
<Ascendant> it's quite powerful though
<Ascendant> when used correctly
<Articuno> 12It's the best CMS.
<Ascendant> better than wordpress imo
<Articuno> 12TST used to be Phpnuke
<Articuno> 12now THAAAT was bad
<Ascendant> phpnuke
<Articuno> 12and wordpress is more limitede.
<Articuno> 12-e
<Ascendant> mfw
<Ascendant> wordpress is crap
<Articuno> 12Whats mfw?
<Ascendant> drupal is okay
<Ascendant> mfw = my face when
<Articuno> 12LOL

<Ascendant> .______________.
<Ascendant> <- never paid for anything
<Ascendant> technically you could code the website by hand and do with that
<Ascendant> but when you need to update menus etc.

<lightumbreon> or time....
<Ascendant> and there's always the possibility of more bugs
<lightumbreon> i normaly update my dad's site once a month, if joomla does co-operate.....
<Ascendant> as your code usually isn't tested for bugs and possible security holes
<Ascendant> you need to know how to use it properly :x

<eXAKR> You know what
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<eXAKR> IE9 interface
<eXAKR> Chrome's speed
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah?
<drfsupercenter> 03IE9 :/
<eXAKR> Firefox's flexibility
<drfsupercenter> 03They ruined it
<drfsupercenter> 038 was the best one IMHO
<eXAKR> Opera's tightness
<HyperMetalLugia> Ie9 was a letdown, sorta
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<HyperMetalLugia> That
<HyperMetalLugia> That'
<HyperMetalLugia> kjbes
<HyperMetalLugia> THAT IS WHEN eveyone loves eachother
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL eXAKR, you can join my friend usotsuki's quest to program your own browser then ;P
<eXAKR> There should be a web browser with all of that
<eXAKR> Then we won't have to choose
<eXAKR> Oh?
<HyperMetalLugia> Which isn't going to happen ;P
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03he wants to use Firefox's backend to make an entirely different browser
<drfsupercenter> 03with no bloat and whatnot
<eXAKR> Nice
<eXAKR> Tell him to program a native Windows interface in
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<eXAKR> I hate the Firefox XULRunner interface
<drfsupercenter> 03the name sounds familiar but I'm not sure what that is
<eXAKR> There was a version of Firefox for Mac that used Mac's default interface
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate all of FF's interface ;p
<eXAKR> Can't remember it's name
<eXAKR> its *
<drfsupercenter> 03> <eXAKR> Tell him to program a native Windows interface in
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki[evilmachines]> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03<usotsuki[evilmachines]> actually, at this point I'm tempted to gut Gecko altogether and try to fix up the Arora browser.
<eXAKR> A Windows Presentation Foundation web browser
<eXAKR> i.e. a web browser with a WPF interface
<eXAKR> Dream come true
<eXAKR> Windows Vista and Seven native UI
<drfsupercenter> 03uh
<drfsupercenter> 03IE8 was pretty much that, wasn't it?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Just kidding, turns out it's not actually ready yet :|
<drfsupercenter> 03WOAH
<drfsupercenter> 03That pink color looks completely different on this new monitor

<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy` and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<prince-dari> Wow, timeout already.
<Lambda> haha, yeah, that was quick
<Stormy`> Just my router derping again, probably
<prince-dari> You know, I just realised that I used to cringe when the MLP intro came on, now I feel more like singing along with it. Scary.
<Lambda> XD yes that is scary
<Stormy> Haha
<Stormy> definitely a brony
<prince-dari> And you are all my brony friends. :P
<Lambda> you should've heard him last night :P
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> let me find the log
<Lambda> [03:03] <+prince-dari> [09:02] <Lambda> http://d3uwin5q170wpc.cloudfront.net/photo/103468_700b_v1.jpg Saw that picture - thought "Cutie mark is a radiation symbol". :P
<Stormy> LOL
<Stormy> that's worse than me
<prince-dari> I just have ponies on the mind because I've watched it a lot recently. :P
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> The only time I've watched it recently was when I was visiting you, Stormy, and you had the one where fluttershy was babysitting on you laptop
<Lambda> *your
<Stormy> You still haven't watched the others?
<Lambda> nope
<Stormy> The people are disappoint
<Lambda> sorry the people
<prince-dari> Your vote from The_People is in jeopardy. XD
<Lambda> and that vote is necessary!
<Lambda> okay fine
<Lambda> I'll do it
<Lambda> one episode a night until I've seen them all
<Lambda> would that make the people happy?
<Stormy> :P
<Stormy> Maybe
<prince-dari> Lawl, I wonder if your rivavl candidate Nyan can match that.
<Lambda> worth a shot I suppose
<Lambda> doubt it
<Lambda> Nyan can't even measure up to such campaign promises
<prince-dari> We should break the news to SF that most of their moderators are bronies. :P
<prince-dari> I bet the reaction would be lulz-worthy.
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> Just RDX and SR who aren't
<Stormy> Well, I don't know about SR
<Stormy> but he doesn't /seem/ like he'd be one
<Lambda> NEVER KNOW
<Lambda> maybe he is
<prince-dari> That would be hillarious.
<Lambda> that would be sooo funny
<Lambda> you're visiting ponychan and he says something that gives him away
<Lambda> you reply "is that you SR?"
<Lambda> "Uhhhhhh... I have to go"
<prince-dari> I saw a brony with "Stormy" in the name.
<Stormy> It's not me
<Stormy> I posted once on ponychan
<Stormy> as anonymous
<Lambda> was it Stormytrooper?
<Lambda> if so it might've been me posting in my sleep
<prince-dari> I think it was someone else.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> Not to mention the brony I saw saying "Kekekekekek"
<Lambda> haha
<prince-dari> Rurik is the least likely person I see as a brony. XD
<Lambda> I've never heard stormy say that
<Stormy> Also, SR's pony-sona's cutie mark would be a computer with a laser on the screen
<Lambda> XDDDD
<Stormy> that would give it away
<prince-dari> LOL
<Stormy> :P
<Lambda> mine would be a TIE fighter
<Lambda> or an Indiana Jones hat'
<Lambda> RDX's would be the Coke logo
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> dari's is a monocle
<prince-dari> Yeah. XD
<Lambda> because I just know this
<Stormy> it actually is a monocle?
<Stormy> XD
<Lambda> Stormy's is a pikachu eared dragon
<Stormy> lolno
<Lambda> nah, I made that up
<Stormy> I don't know what mine would be actually
<prince-dari> Also, have you seen this GIF before? http://arch.413chan.net/Apple_Bloom_-_Cutie_Mark-(n1297311330037).gif
<Lambda> Aristeo's would be a female elf
<Lambda> aren't I right Aristeo?
<Stormy> I'm still a blank flank ;__;
<Lambda> BLANK FLANK XD
<Lambda> that's epic
<Stormy> ahh, scary
<prince-dari> Don't worry, there are lots of talented blank flank ponies, Sapphire Shores for example. :P
<Lambda> blank flank is epic
<Stormy> Lambda, they actually say that in some of the episodes
<prince-dari> I think that was her name.
<Stormy> Sapphire Shores is? o.O
<Stormy> wouldn't hers be like music notes or something?
<prince-dari> Yeah, if you look she doesn't have one.
<Stormy> weird
<Lambda> is derpy a blank fank
<Lambda> *flank
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Stormy> she has bubbles
<prince-dari> Aww, too slow.
<Lambda> XD PERFECT
<Stormy> don't ask me what that means
<Lambda> OOOHHH BUBBLES! MY BUBBLES!
<Lambda> she's the derpy bubble fish from Finding Nemo
<Lambda> he was awesome
<Stormy> lol
<prince-dari> "MODS ARE ASLEEP, POST PONIES!"
<Lambda> Haha
<prince-dari> http://s4.postimage.org/yc4r7no8f/Mods_Are_Asleep_Post_Ponies_6433.jpg
<Lambda> http://youtu.be/YLDbGqJ2KYk
<prince-dari> Hm.
<Lambda> it's disgusting, but funny how the other two stop fighting
<prince-dari> I've never seen a cat throw up before.
<prince-dari> It looks like milk.
<Stormy> I see a cat throw up at least once a week when I'm home
*prince-dari licks.
<Lambda> hehe
<prince-dari> :P
<Lambda> oh peaches
<Stormy> "thats what happens at most? college parties. Fights and puking"
<Lambda> was that a comment?
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> Not sure where that question mark came from
<Lambda> that always happens when copypastaing youtube quotes for some reason
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdQj2ohqCBk&feature=related
<Lambda> in my opinion kitties > ponies
<Nick> I am Painis cupcake
<Nick> I will eat you
<prince-dari> Sure IRL, but I don't know any good kitten cartoons. :P
<Stormy> aww
<Lambda> very true
<Lambda> haha watch the drunk kitty related video next
<Stormy> IRL kittens > everything
<Lambda> :D
<Stormy> haha, it walks a couple steps and then just flops on the floor
<Lambda> haha yeah
<Stormy> my cat was like that after he got neutered
<prince-dari> LOL, related video, cat that likes to watch the toilet flush. Looks as though it's thinking "OH MY GOD! THIS IS MAGICAL! AGAIN!".
<Lambda> David after Dentist: Kitty edition
<Lambda> holy crap that was the one I watched next too
<Lambda> it's an endless stream of related kitty videos
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1edDfzluXE&NR=1
<Stormy> I wish all cats could do that ._.
<Lambda> hahaha yeah
<Lambda> or all pets in general
<Lambda> like the dog on Bruce Almighty
