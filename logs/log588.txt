either over Tinychat or Skype, not quite sure yet

Yawn.

gamecube
2002
yes
It is free.
just hope laptop can handle this
Intel is really... crappy
hiya
I'm planning to ask my parents for an alienware laptop for my 18th birthday
ROFL^
Please tell me you're joking.
Alienware are a joke.
^This
I'm surprised my Intel graphics card can handle GTA 4 and Skyrim quite nice :D
They're good style and all, but not worth the price.
^^^^^
lol
:D
I mean alienware has great design and looks and all that..but it isn't worth the dosh. Their specifications aren't that great.
I believe
Mines has an i7 whatever that is.
hmmm might browse around Newegg for a computer
Just cause it has Nike on it, they'll charge alot.
understood
Desktop all the way :$
^^^
they*
in fact I might start dto research right now
If you could fully customise a laptop, I would be fine with one
But you can't really :(
hmm either buy a gaming computer or build one
Sometimes you can change the CPU/GPU, but it depends on the design.
I find Toshiba to be a great make. Never had any problems with their high end laptops.
RAM/HDD you can change fine.
Lasted its time.
Yup. Well made.
eh toshiba
Samsung are good to.
^
I'm on ipad
And I'm not even gonna get into Apple. ;-;
:D
i HATE apple
Android or gtfo.
same here I still kind of don't like them
I know.
The others break like a match stick
Android is great for their open API and customisable interface.
Apple can build a nice looking computer
drop it?, glass breaks
An example is the OUYA console, that thing is gonna be mental.
Open API Android console.
yeah the jailbreaker are able to po android to ios devices
port
/me still needs to beat Half-life 2
Disappoint :P
^
That is exactly right.
There are several examples that could be thrown in, but I'm too lazy at the moment.
There are several factors that it won't be applied though.
Alright everypony! Good night and have a nice dream/day!
I think I'm going for the asus g74sx
The ASUS G Series is decent.
Seen several reviews on different ones.
I have an ASUS TF201
Team Fortress 201? :P
it's 1600
Not too bad.
$1600
This is totally Team Fortress 201 :D
http://uk.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime_TF201/
And a high end Toshiba Satellite Pro gaming laptop.
Toshiba have always made their Satellite laptops great.
^
Ello there everypony.
To be honest I'm kind of a work first fun later person
IMHO i hate apple but they are good for work
at timed
times
I can't help but procrastinate every. single. day.
^
Haha.
porn?
I've angered my parents hundreds of times because of it.
thats procraterbation not procratinationg

I'd actually appreaciate school more if there was only few homework and the learning system is FUN.
^^^^^^^^
The learning system is horrible
Makes me cry.
Also I'm most likely going into a field in computers
^
i am thinking of getting back into playing Piano
hoping to get one for birthday
I like music, until the learning system made it confusing
ded
alright best buy has the computer for $300 dollars less
A penis survey computer
There's a lot of avid gamers here, but the only shit they play are MMORPGs and FPS

Reddit isn't all that bad until you discover the fucked up subreddits
I don't want to know

Yeah it is.

Hmm, this is verry appealing :)
Yep.
(Source of this information is off Steam)
Jeez, I have to wait two months though. Having bills sucks, I have little to no money left for myself nowadays
Oh bills, how fun.
Alienware laptop.
Build a custom desktop.
Don't even bother with Alienware.
Or something.
Is portability absolutely needed? Or just essential?
I am currently on 4.5 years on my current build, and if you build with a really good mobo they last for a long time. all the systems I build for myself and friends are with asus mobos
I'd go with the desktop option, with $1600 you could build a great system.
Ew Macbook.
I used to feel the same way about macs, but i was forced into them because of work. and it is hard to quetion the hardware they use
Then go with a decent laptop, just not Alienware.
You get Alienware and I'll hunt you down :(
Macbooks have a decent design/architecture but it's just the fact that it is Apple.
hello everypony
Some things they're more beneficial in then laptops, but still.
I'd say go with an Asus G Series laptop, reasonably priced and great specifications if you get the right one.
But it is completely up to you.
Just throwing my two cents in.
^
There is always flaws with something.
Exactly.
Toshiba Satellite laptops are well built as well.
Had one of the old series and lasted me for 5~ years.
They do.
I had to use a cooler-mat, but even that wouldn't cool it down fully.
Haven't touched a laptop since.
A SSD in a laptop is questionable tbh.
hello every pony
I swapped out the hdd, and got another hour of "youtube" time out of it
why why did it have to end like that :'(
I hope you've read the sequel.
Lemme get the link for you.
I'm not 100% if it is the official sequel or not, but the authors seem to be the same.

That's over two years.
and wow, congrats on that :D
I leave it on all the time. <:
well xchat irc is a free program.
mIRC is free too
no it's not.
You just have to click through the window that pops up when the trial is over
which is the best IRC client and why?
Oh lord, take cover.
lol
The trial period runs out, but you can still use it
Similar to winrar
IRC?
Ipad?
:P
i might give it a try later on then.
I've used mIRC myself, worked fine. Saw my problems.
But I'm fine with the website IRC.
oh :P

/me never played Timesplitters
hey everypony
DAMN SCRIPT >_>
Then get it
It's PS2
You should go play it.
PS2 is best console
NO, SNES IS BEST CONSOLE.
Or N64..
PS2 had all the good PS1 and PS2 games
And kicked again. fml
:P
LOL
Is that Caravan Palace I hear? AWESOME.
...Wow
AHAHAHAHA
Kick scripts really hate you
WOW FML.
I HATE THIS SCRIPT.
MW2 is my favourite CoD
boom
PS2 was great for its variety of games.
:<
Highlight of PS2
^
that'll do, just mouth the word
I'd prefer Ratchet and Clank though
Best series ever made.
Plus CoD 1 and 2 were the best CoDs xD
Hellow :+
:3*
First CoD was the bomb.
Second CoD was great for multiplayer.
I still remember D-day landing
The first Modern Warfare was the best in my opinion.
^
I'm gonna get ready for church now.
^
Peace
Zombies is THE BOMB.
I played campaign too
Because campaign is always fun
Yeah campaign as well.
but multiplayer..
/me shivers
But yeah, zombies was the highlight
IMO
Eh..
Someone (I think DCD) told me there was going to be zombies with something like up to 12 people on BO II
Yes and no.
^
Tribes Ascend.
Wii is a pretty good
console
Wii is alright..but still
I only got it for Metroid Prime 3
They're gonna have to make much bigger maps for zombies if they intend to have up to 12 people being able to play though.
Wii convinced me to flail my arms infront of tv screen...
^^^
>PS2
>only liked a couple of games
kingdom hearts.
KINGDOM HEARTS.
0.0
Ratchet and Clank
uh
Timesplitters yeah.
(\
First 3 were good
after that it went down.
dynasty warriors
^^^
Yes
I completely forgot
<3 DW
Lol I remember Dynasty Warriors
AHAHAHAHAH.
Are they still making those?
You need to..yeah
Explore the PS2 to extreme lengths.
I only ever played that through a hidden demo on the Ratchet and Clank 3 disc
Do it now.
Same.
Oh the secrets of Ratchet and Clank. <3
All them bolts, all the upgrades.
This script..
Lightsaber wrench <3
He never beat it lmao
Ratchet and Clank Gladiator was bad-ass.
Star Wars Battlefront 1/2
^
OMG
I want my 3rd one. FML
HOW COULD WE FORGET
Holla everypony! :)
Okay, I have played Battlefront 2 but on PSP :D
PLAYED OVER 250 ON THAT xD
Fun times
The co-op campaign was awesome.
^
I never knew the existence of the N64 cause of the PS3 sadly.
PS2^
Worth it though.
I had a n64 too
Battlefront 3 was pretty much done, then that studio flopped and we never saw it again
Then of course PS2 has all the good PS1 games as well
Since you can play PS1 on PS2
Spyro 1/2/3
^

Yeah you can
Memory card..?
I played GT on PS1
Was never any good at it
But I played it anyway
:P
It was all futuristic and trippy..
i menat ps2
I can't remember the name. QQ
Uhhm
Na that ain't it.
Oh crap, Gran Turismo 3, GTAIII, and SOCOM II were my everything
It had great music too.
lolsocom
Well me and my sister still play PS1 together occasionally
<XAX> Thank you
We play on the PS2
Just reminded me
Digimon World for PS1
DIGIMON WORLD OMG.
Wish I still had my ps2... :(
>:
i feel bad for joshscorcher,these retarde COD ganboy's and 10 yr old kids are giving him a bad name :(
I still have my PS1 around somewhere
Mini PS1, still got.
iPod touches can run PS1 emulators ._.
Road Trip Adventure
Why did you have to say iPod and not Android. ;-;
I LOVED it
^^^^
It was absolutely awesome
SSX 3 and SSX On Tour were my drug
Pikmin.
I never actually owned SSX, but I always used to play it around my friend's house
No bite? Oh wow ;-;
It ain't fair D:
GAMECUBE.
Ahh
*huh?
I never had a gamecube
PS1 was my first console
I used to play gamecube at my friend's house
Commodore 64 was my first 'console'
i never got to play a gamecube
.....
i don't get it
whatchamacall its*
I feel like the gamecube loner. ._.
Yeah.
But I've still got my PS2
Same.
Would be nice not to have to worry about memory cards though I suppose
Tried fixing it, worked for 5 minutes and then went YLOD again.
Bugger.

Spent 2 hours fixing it too.
Got all excited..then boom. ;_;

I laugh at you. ;D
Something about aiming with analogue sticks
I've tried many times.
Mouse/keyboard > Controller most of the time.
I remember playing SW Battlefront 1 for the first time when I was a kid
"OMGOMG HOW DO I AIIIIIIM?!!?!"
Was gonna hurt you for a second. ;-;
^
Cause if you were, you would of been thrown out a window.
Multiple times.
I always knew PC>CONSOLE
I prefer analogue sticks for aiming to beh onest
And a Sherlock episode comes to mind.
be honest*
I just never had the money for one.
I tried surfing.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
LOL

I pretty sure he did..unless I'm thinking of someone else
You might be.
too much for zblock?

I know right.
He just sits there yelling trying to hit him with a USP
and the face shot :D
^
Yeah I must be thinking of someone else..

bad lip syncing
horrible voice acting

poor mouth animations
bad avatars
games didnt always have crytek facial mimics
Waaaht?!
Dat Voice Acting
And sure enough, this has all of those already.
Whats there to control?
The combat system is fantastic. The sphere grid is admittedly not great but it could be a LOT worse. And some of the cast are really enjoyable.
JPRG**
Edward scissor hands?
Characters look like they belong in One Piece
Wakka annoys me.
inb4 he dies
He borders between insufferably stupid and downright insensitive.
looks like ff
Its wrong to want to live to fight another day?
It's like world of warcraft
NO
looks like WOW
Without turn based
but you just don't like the presentation, the cast or pretty much whatever's in it
I mean come on, you only control one character and the others act on their own?
Really?
these robots must be duds
Tidus isnt bad
he just needs food
KH 3 is coming
There are JRPGs done right since it fits the critera that makes a JRPG
It IS a JRPG.
these character are gonna be annoying
yes 3 guys kill dozens

I loved AVGN's SwordQuest review, since it was very informative of that old Atari contest
whos AVGN?
11,01He did?

irate gamer does 45 second reviews of current gen games
11,02O.O
Imgine 1 precent.
DAH FUCK WAS THAT?
relics from the development process
He's not even all that ticked off. He's played it before and enjoyed it in a warped way. If any adjective could be used to describe him, it's not irate.
FA
11,01Did the AVGN movie come out?
