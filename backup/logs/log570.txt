<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, well that's why it had 12.3 at the title screen
<Panda> Shizuka, you know you can put it all on the same track and it would cut your render time by a bit >.>
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: I know
<Shizuka> 13nope, it's the countdown clock that weighs the most
<Eddmario> Oh Luna, what have I stubmled into now?

<Hipster_Rush> nite Polydunami
<Polydunami> I think it's time I head for bed as well
<Shizuka> 13Panda: thing is for 90% of the video, only one audio track is actually playing anything, there's more video mixing than audio
<Vordox> Eddmario: To be honest, your attitude...
<cratorkid> sniper elite v2 was bad
<Firelight> *Eats top Ramen Block* Again.. Random foods.
<Polydunami> How did you know, Hipster_Rush? :3
<OtakuTom> Oooh, I hope The Last Remnant wins the next vote :3
<Shizuka> 13asuka burns through frames pretty quick, it's the more complicated video mixes that slow things down
<Firelight> -.-
<Hipster_Rush> Polydunami: oh i thought you said Ponies as in all of us :D
<Vordox> Suddenly this cha
<Vordox> chat*

<Hipster_Rush> :D
<Vordox> LAwl Shizuka's all up bragging :D
<Soul> i feel so alone...
<Shizuka> 13rendering maxes out all six cores on and off, is probably why she goes through frames so fast, not to mention not a lot changes
<seatsea> it even says when somone conects
<cratorkid> night everypony
<Soul> xD
<MadSurge> SUDDENDLY
<Vordox> Wuut,, GBA version or DS?
<OohShiny> suddenly JAPAN!
<Polydunami> Oh geeze, it's the original
<GabeMoist> Awww yeeeaaaaah

<OohShiny> suddenly NIHON!
<Dken2021> GBA verison
<MadSurge> GBA version
<Eddmario> There's a GBA version!?!??!!?
<Vordox> Eddmario: Of course, and DS
<OohShiny> what game is this?
<MadSurge> This never came out of Japan
<Kandarihu> The original version! Starting a new save too?
<Polydunami> Released only in Japan
<Vordox> Dat offbeat. XD
<Panda> thats odd Shizuka, I couldnt imagine maxing out 6 cores! i only have a dual and mine doesnt max all that often.
<Kandarihu> This so needs a translation patch.
<Mutterguy> beep blop!
<Hipster_Rush> so Shizuka were those animated parts of the intermission still a trouble to ya?
<bob> ?
<Dken2021> and since he's using an emulator, button lag won't be as precise
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ewww...the timing is off >>
<MadSurge> OohShiny: Rhythm Tengoku
<Panda> SuperBrony64, hehe ^^
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: That's what you get with Emus. :P
<Shizuka> 13railings is the only manually animated slide
<bob> now lets see the chart
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: kinda
<Mutterguy> [Achievement 15 minutes of fame!]been on brony state for 15 minute
<Shizuka> 13the rest are stills, video, or a few vectors layered on each other, sometimes panning
<Pwnies> Who here can read Japanese, just a trivial questchin
<GabeMoist> I can read some
<GabeMoist> I'm learning
<Eddmario> Pwnies: Google translate
<GabeMoist> sometimes
<MASF123> I can't at all. -_-
<Dken2021> Eddmario never use that for translating
<Dken2021> ever
<Pwnies> ... just as a trivial questchin
<MadSurge> Shizuka: That still was an amazing intermission :3
<GabeMoist> Google translate doesn't understand the concept of grammar
<Panda> wait... Shizuka the time counts down... no?
<Shizuka> 13yup
<GabeMoist> especially with japanese
<Shizuka> 13but the clock video it uses counted up
<Eddmario> I wanna learn Japanese. And German. And maybe Russian
<Shizuka> 13if i ever do countdowns again i'll be rendering that reversed first, so it's not doing it realtime
<Panda> Shizuka, so its reversed and chroma keyed... and what SV are you using?
<Mutterguy> I can't see the entertainment value yet
<Phase4> 00,02>not sure how large to make canvas
<Shizuka> 13?
<bob> yeaaa beat it up
<Phase4> 00,02>makes 4096 wide
<GabeMoist> Eddmario, if you want to learn Japanese there are plenty of sites to learn with
<Phase4> 00,02> 16:9
<Panda> Shizuka, sony vegas
<Shizuka> 13oh 9
<bob> :/
<Very_Silly_Filly> You're miles off :3
<GabeMoist> dat data
<MadSurge> :D
<Kandarihu> Hmm.
<Shizuka> 13basically i took a black video, stuck the timecode in the corner, put in some masks so only the minutes and seconds showed, and rendered 20 minutes
<Tovler> k, back
<Hipster_Rush> Phase4: wat?
<Pwnies> U SILLY FILY
<OohShiny> I don't understand it
<Phase4> 00,02Hipster_Rush, paintchat
<Shizuka> 13then i reverse it, invert the colors, and chroma key out white
<Hipster_Rush> ah
<Phase4> 00,02canvas is small, 1200x900 or something
<Phase4> 00,02so i make big
<Phase4> 00,02: D
<MadSurge> :D
<Polydunami> I'm out
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh, are people using paintchat for once?
<Dken2021> seeya pol--oh
<Panda> Shizuka, that may be the reason why it takes you so long, a lot of people i know rolled back to 8 and 7 because 9 was glitchy and resource consuming. wait... have you tried using after effects?
<Kandarihu> I see.
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, yes and no
<Shizuka> 13after effects strikes me as overpowered for sticking a bunch of pictures and video together :3
<OohShiny> Shizuka is from Nihon or anything?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've never actually used it, it's always been locked when I go into it
<MadSurge> Inb4 SuperBrony64 quits at the Bon Odori stage
<pony_9575> what game is this
<bob> boink
<Shizuka> 13plus after effects makes asuka cry... vegas can keep all six cores busy, but after effects is extremely hard when it does its render
<Panda> Shizuka, thats true, but it could help out with render time and quality. i know you dont need anything THAT intensinve. was just asking ^^
<MadSurge> OohShiny: she's from germany methinks
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Very_Silly_Filly> Shizuka: Vega's rendering is like VRROOOOOM
<Shizuka> 13besides i had a book to take up the hour :3
<Panda> Shizuka, oh? what book? if you dont mind me asking ^^
<Shizuka> 13just scrubbing through now looking for errors (found one, plus a handful i don't think i can fix)
<MadSurge> Hey, baby! How's it going?
<Shizuka> 13halo the flood, the book that narrates the first game
<OohShiny> have a craving for Guitar Hero now
<MASF123> What day is today? My computer calender is broken...well it won't display for some reason.
<Shizuka> 13today is twensday smarch 43rd
<Very_Silly_Filly> Friiiiday friiiday
<Dken2021> DANG SMARCH WEATHER
<MadSurge> MASF123: 20th july :D
<Panda> Shizuka, oh my! thats awesome... and uh >.> could I help with fixing those errors? Video editing is kind of a passion of mine >.>
<Dken2021> why hello capslocks, didn't notice ya
<SuperBrony64> 11,02idonteven
<Shizuka> 13while vegas happily accepts animated gifs, it doesn't seem to like looping them
<MadSurge> BOOOO
<Eddmario> If it's before midnight MASF123, then it's Thursday. If it's after, it's FRIDAY FRIDAY, GOTTA GET DOWN ON FRIDAY!
<Shizuka> 13leaves a teeeeeeeny pause between the loop, which means the buffer circles pause just a blink
<Very_Silly_Filly> Shizuka: Yeah, unfortunately, you have to keep looping then
<OohShiny> Eddmario, you shall burn in Hellfire
<Shamroc> night night everypony!
<Shizuka> 13same problem i had on the technical derpiculties video with her eyes
<Very_Silly_Filly> In order to get a seamless finish
<OohShiny> g'night Shamroc
<Soul> o.o
<MadSurge> Radish hair!
<Phase4> 00,02as soon as cloudflare updates its cache, canvas should be bigger
<Shizuka> 13derpy walking across the screen was fine, but the eyes stuttered on the gif seam
<seatsea> dat face
<Dken2021> yea, trying to be precise with a game with a emulator would sorta be a problem
<Panda> Shizuka, really? hm... have you tried clipping it and then copy and pasting it?
<bob> the hell is this @_@
<MASF123> 33!
<Shizuka> 13i would but it's like less than half a second long, didn't want to end up with so many clips
<xxMoopyxx> do you know this game?
<Shizuka> 13referencing them to each other would probably be easier but oh well
<Dken2021> bob it's the Rhythm heaven game that wasn't localized
<MASF123> Peel dat onion.
<Shizuka> 13just like the awards show, i do not intend to look at vegas again for a long time :3
<Panda> Shizuka, you could always batch edit them, you know.
<OohShiny> dat egptian music
<bob> wieeeerrrrd ._.
<Shizuka> 13YES the toot video finally synced
<MASF123> Reminds me of Warioware.
<OohShiny> bob, Japanese games are strange
<Dken2021> it's made by those same guys
<Shizuka> 13what is friendship fell out of sync again but oh well
<DeadpoolDash> I found the best video on youtube ever!
<MASF123> Majora's Mask was pretty weird...in an awesome way.
<bob> i guess kids would get nightmares looking at that face
<OohShiny> ouch
<Vordox> Dat was....
<MASF123> There is an urban legend of Ben who drowned in Majora's Mask.
*Eddmario has only played Ocarina of Time 3DS
<Panda> Shizuka do you test render at all?
<Soul> ben?
<Shizuka> 13sort of, i make a few passes at full quality as i go
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nintendo, y u no maek Super Mario Sunshine 3D?
<MASF123> Yes....ben.
<Shizuka> 13mostly cause i hate fiddling with the render as settings

<Eddmario> Very_Silly_Filly: THIS!
<Soul> i dont even want to know....
<Vordox> Tap Tap
<MadSurge> THIS IS A TERRIBLE STAGE :D
<bob> right left right left righ left
<Panda> Shizuka, well i meant as in rendering a small protion for quality and sync check.
<MASF123> :D
<Shizuka> 13if i could tell it to render just a chunk, that would be great
<MadSurge> Football, sesame!
<Firelight> Hey guys I'm ba- WHAT THE FUCK?
<Shizuka> 13see that part i dunno about
<MadSurge> Hey Firelight!
<Dken2021> welcome back Firelight
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm pretty sure you can preview it at around 90% quality
<Shizuka> 13alls i know is you push the button and it dumps the whole thing to a video... after an hour..
<Panda> Shizuka, you know how to hightlight a portion of the time line right?
<Firelight> Can someoen please explain what is going on?!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did you speed it up?
<Shizuka> 13must have had it turned off or something last time i played
<Spell-of-Gaming> OohShiny: Your point is invalid. Everyone has a pony version. :P
<Shizuka> 13which was years ago anyway
<Soul> yes! :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Perfect logic
<xxMoopyxx> No no no no no no no no
<TheHoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: better this way

<MadSurge> SUPAIDAMAN
<OohShiny> Spell-of-Gaming, the pony version is always weaker in power, but stronger in cuteness.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Only need 0.98 game complete to level up to 10
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: it's a difference of like 1 bpm iirc
<Shizuka> 13they were almost perfect

<Hipster_Rush|> CrimsonPhoenix: if you show me yours i'll show you mine
<Ninjazz> Wink, wink, nudge nudge.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hipster_Rush|, it's a phoenix, just pick up any phoenix in MLP
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's it
<RAWRity> So, without spoiling anything: Dark Knight Rises is absolutely fantastic and you should all go see it.
<Spectrum_Rush|> Ninjazz: say no more, say no more
<MASF123> @Nittany_Discord, I hope you feel better. I dislike depression as much as the next brony.
<TheHoodyNinja> Shizuka: to be honest the music doesnt fit at the time, as in, the music isnt right for the head bobbing
<Ninjazz> XP
<OtakuTom> I plan on seeing it this weekend, RAWRity
<Spectrum_Rush|> ;)
<Ninjazz> RAWRity, done and done. Got the tickets ready and heading out tonight! :D
<RAWRity> OtakuTom: go out and see it right now.
<Shizuka> 13TheHoodyNinja: like i said i went over it at 0.5x speed to ensure the timing worked, render messed it up anyway
<Shizuka> 13at least now it adds quirk rather than breaking it entirely
<Shizuka> 13that would have been had i left it at the original speed
<OtakuTom> It's 3:30am here...no shows until later...plus, my fiance would hate me if I were to go see it without her :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just need to get away from living under a family member's roof and back on my own. I don't see it as happening quick.
<Spectrum_Rush|> aww CrimsonPhoenix your no fun :D
<SirGanjalf> Vordox: SFM PONEYZ:O

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone in my family is fairly hard to live with, so it depresses me. Today was just bad because of my grandmother's friends who spend so much time complaining.
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: you sure you dont need more than one day?
<StaticsCloud> fuuuck
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Complaining about my brother. Complaining about their kids. UGH!
<Vordox> TheHoodyNinja: Heck, Internet is part of me. :P
<SirGanjalf> In the meantime i'll post some other SFM videos
<TheHoodyNinja> Vordox: does that mean i can download porn off of you?
<StaticsCloud> I passed out on my keyboard : (

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: I have anxiety issues that are currently preventing me from getting work. Feel life my life is almost at a dead-end right now.
<SirGanjalf> Spectrum_Rush: What's innapriopriate in Big Lebowski?
<Ponies47> Nighty night Shizuschlafen :)
<MASF123> I'm very sorry to hear that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd love to go back to school, but memory issues and ADHD will prevent that. Plus depression.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So I have no clue what to do with my life right now.
<TheHoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: Cant let your problems run your life
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well I'll go to bed now, Nittany_Discord good luck with that. Depression is never easy to go through
<Craven> i have anxiety issues also
<Spectrum_Rush|> SirGanjalf: previous pic
<CrimsonPhoenix> but before I go, SAY HELLO TO MR. HAPPY FACE http://youtu.be/LCQSpzjHxpQ
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just sit here and let family drive me to a mental hospital I guess.
<MASF123> I don't think I'm helping you feel better...once again please forgive my rudeness.
<Craven> i find the best way to get over them is to completely ignore what your mind is telling you lol
<Soul> there will always be good and bad times
<bob> no one is streaming?
<Craven> shut it off and push it back it doesnt work all the time but it works alot. (best way i know about dealing with it)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheHoodyNinja: I'm not doing nothing. I am getting voc rehab for work.
<Soul> look forward to the good and try to forget the bad
<SirGanjalf> Spectrum_Rush|: Oh, that? Joke. I'm a traditionalist in that case.
<SirGanjalf> :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But you are right.
<Spectrum_Rush|> and now i confus
<TheHoodyNinja> damn Nitt i wish i could say something to help
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: You're fine.
<MASF123> ok thanks...I always am paranoid. :)
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz yawns
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheHoodyNinja: You've said something already.
*TheHoodyNinja throws a blanket on Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<Ninjazz> I can only hope you'll feel better soon, Nittany_Discord.
*Ninjazz gives Spectrum_Rush|Zzz a pillow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me too.
*Ponies47 Carries Spectrum_Rush|Zzz to his bed
<RAWRity> It's nearly 5 am. I should be sleeping, but Dark Knight Rises has me so damn wired I doubt I'll be sleeping anytime soon.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity sooo good movie ?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> danke TheHoodyNinja Ninjazz Ponies47 :)
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Ponies47> RAWRity: O.O
<Ponies47> ^^
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: fucking GREAT movie
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: never had a movie keep me riled up before, must be good
<MASF123> @Nittany_Discord have you've seen a psychiatrist yet? I've been planning to go see one myself actually.
<Pwnies> Why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: Can't afford to.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I do know one to talk to over the phone.
<Ponies47> I must see The Dark Knight Rises! ^^
<SirGanjalf> ^
<MASF123> Neither can I, but I mean later when I can find a job.
<Panda> Nittany_Discord :( whats wron
<Panda> wrong*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's private health care.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord try getting busy with anything that helps me to get by :p
<RAWRity> everyone should go see it.
<SirGanjalf> Too bad, there are no IMAX cinemas around my place:|
<Ponies47> My cat just scared the (squee) outta me O~O
<RAWRity> YOu know how everyone was buzzed about Avengers? And saying it was the best Super Hero movie ever? Dark Knight Rises blows it out of the water.
*TheHoodyNinja wants a cat
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> when i have nothing to do i start thinking too much and then things get drepresing, one of the reasons why i hate summer, too much free time for me to handle
<nipa_> Season 3 is coming next month!!
<Souporcat> really?
<TheHoodyNinja> nipa_: new here or sumthin?
*Ninjazz is going to see DKR in IMAX /)^3^(\
<Ponies47> nipa_: We all know that. NO SPOILERS!
<nipa_> : D
<nipa_> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need organization but not a competitive environment (yet).
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope is not
<Souporcat> What's the specific releases date?
<thegt90> guys lookin for pony wallpapers for my vita any suggestions
<RAWRity> things that have me not-so-happy: the Trailers I saw before it.
<Pwnies> Like c'mon. I am actually screwed up, and enjoy thinking about toturing people I despise, and sometime get very suicidal thoughts, but hey, I don't care for a shrink. Also when the news report about people getting murdered horrible, I laugh. And If you remember, I laughed at 3 minutes of Natalie Portman. Everyone hated me for that ;__;
<MASF123> Try anything...feeling depressed is no way to go. I've almost given up many times...been thinking about suicide frequently, even around the time I 1st started coming here, but just fight it is all...like depression.
<Ninjazz> ... okay... then...
<Pwnies> *Natalie Portman crying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: If they put you on meds, be very, very careful about what they put you on.
<TheHoodyNinja> Ninjazz: bronystate, a happy place!
<Ninjazz> TheHoodyNinja, ikr?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some psych meds can make you worse.
<TheHoodyNinja> Meds never worked on me :p
<MASF123> Why is that, though?
<Pwnies> BronyState will always be a happy place
<Pwnies> Were everything is norm
<RAWRity> Trailers for: Jack Reacher, The Bourne Legacy, Total Recall, Man of Steel, Oz The Great and Powerful, Gangster Squad
<Ponies47> I have to take meds. BUT I NEVER TAKE EM! :p
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord btw do you have a pic of your OC' draconiidon'tknowhowtospellthis
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: at least their were no oogieloves
<Pwnies> The stream isn't on, right?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
<Pwnies> Ah good
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Draconequus
<TheHoodyNinja> not good
<MASF123> I've been even trying to take self-hypnosis sessions...plz give me them pills.
<Soul> i will pray for all of you
<Pwnies> Thought my PC was fucking up agn
<RAWRity> Jack Reacher looked boring, adn I hate Tom Cruise. Bourne Legacy is unnecessary fluff. Man of Steel looks god awful boring. Oz The Great and Powerful IS A PREQUEL TO GOD DAMN WIZARD OF OZ FOR FUCK SAKE, and Gangster Squad looks decent.
<RAWRity> But by far the best trailer: Quentin Tarantino's "Django Unchained"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More sequelitis?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity i just want to watch the hobbit
<TheHoodyNinja> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> after that i don't care
*Pwnies looks to his left and see's his dog staring at him begging for a chance to play
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Inb4 Wizard of Oz trilogy.
<MASF123> @Nittany_Discord, are you at all religious?
*Pwnies laughs and keeps typing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: Christian
<SirGanjalf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_WucrXsuYo
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, seeing as that's TWO movie, you're gonna have to wait to see the second half.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> eh better
<Pwnies> SirGanjalf I liked that movie :)
<MASF123> Hmm...I don't believe in God anymore...ever since I was in like 6th grade. Now I'm an adult. Lol.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Does it have to be colored? I don't have a properly-colored sketch of ND.
<Pwnies> MASF123 Same here
<RAWRity> Seriously though, As I was watching the trailer for Oz the Great and Powerful, I just started slowly facepalming.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> since i can't color nope :p does not need to be colored
<RAWRity> Because It slowly dawned on me that yes, this was really hapening, and yes, it was exactly what I thought it was.
<MASF123> Pwnies, and I often get it pushed by my family to believe, it's not their decision.
<RAWRity> Good fucking christ. WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A PREQUEL TO WIZARD OF OZ?
<Pwnies> I've always thought, is America pretty religious?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/nittanydiscord001.png/
<Ninjazz> You're hyping me up, RAWRity.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Money.
<RAWRity> THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND BOOK WERE METAPHORS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why sequels? Money. Why remakes? Money.
<Pwnies> Because here in Aus, it's kinda 50/50
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why that reason? Shit economy.
<SirGanjalf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_KbP0zELV0 - Why not Medic?
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: were running out of ideas for original movies
<MASF123> Why Money? To buy MLP toys! :D
<RAWRity> TheHoodyNinja: make a prequel to something that ISN'T 90 years old and a classic
<Pwnies> Some people, including myself, can't give two fucks about religion
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: I cant do it
<TheHoodyNinja> so dont tell me too
<RAWRity> hell, you want to make a movie based on pre-existing content, hurry up and make a god damn Flash movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if don't mind me asking the botom leg is from what ?
<TheHoodyNinja> i dont belong to any religion, but i dont deny their existance
<RAWRity> Hell, they're already planning a Batman reboot for the inevitable Justice League movie.
<TheHoodyNinja> i believe all the gods are roomates
<MASF123> I often come here to get rid of boredom, but I lose some much time in that process... :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pwnies: America is seen as predominately Christian, but that is changing.
<Pwnies> Yeah I thought so'
<TheHoodyNinja> the only religion i cant stand is scientology
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't get mad about it.
<Pwnies> Aus is really leaning towards Atheist
<SirGanjalf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weMpv14cW9U
<Pwnies> Mostly everyone I know is Atheist
<MASF123> I think ever religion is wrong is and is merely just a believe to help guide people in the right direction with morals and stories.
<MASF123> every
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A lot of people are turned away from religion because of extremists that shove their beliefs down other's throats.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: well, it IS predominantly christian, as more thant 50% of the country is Some form of Protestant or another. Granted, that's slowly, slowly changing. But I'd say we've got another 10-30 years before Christianity isn't the majority, if not more.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or condemn everyone that doesn't think they way they do.
<SirGanjalf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6rCf7BIgY
<RAWRity> Meh, my feeling on religion and faith in general is that if it makes you happy or comforts you, good for you, keep at it.
<RAWRity> And allow others to find what makes them happy.
<MASF123> Nearly every hispanic I've gotten in contact here in America is Christian.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Exactly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity.
<TheHoodyNinja> I pretend to worship fim to troll my friend
<Pwnies> I agree with MASF123. Religion was created by people of much higher intelligence, to make them have some motivation, to actually have a life.
<RAWRity> I'm not religious myself, but I've seen many of my friends find comfort through faith, and I'd never try to take that away from them.
<Pwnies> RAWRity, same, I don't ever talk about religion to my friends as some of them are strong christians
<TheHoodyNinja> people will believe what they want to believe
<SirGanjalf> Any Flying Spaghetti Monster worshippers, here?
<TheHoodyNinja> SirGanjalf: my sisters not a brony
<Pwnies> I've really just came to the decision that whatever happens when I die, will happen. Until then, I'll try to steer away from my Anxiety and Suicidal thoughts :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> as long as no one try to shove their religion down my throat you can keep with it
<SirGanjalf> TheHoodyNinja: Since i'm a brony, i was thinking "about" converting to Invisible Pink Unicorn cult:p
<Ninjazz> I'm Christian because of my schooling and stayed one because of the message.
<Pwnies> I was keeping a open mind to Atheism and Christianity, but when I read some stories about the thigs some Christians have done for god, I suddenly stopped and just stopped thinking about it altogether
<SirGanjalf> *"converting", wrong quote fail
<TheHoodyNinja> SirGanjalf: a pink unicorn would be terrible, i mean, imagin a g4 unicorn with pink colors
<Pwnies> I was schooled up until the 7th Grade to believe in God
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ahh we talking about religon eh?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> well then
<TheHoodyNinja> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: go back to sleep
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it seems there are not a lot of topics at this time
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TheHoodyNinja: but i don't want to :'(
<Pwnies> But I just went one day "Wait a bloody moment"
<TheHoodyNinja> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: fine, you can stay
<SirGanjalf> TheHoodyNinja: But it's invisible! No aestethic worries.
<TheHoodyNinja> SirGanjalf: if its invisible its not pink, its clear
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm a Christian. Just not a traditional one. I could never get into going to church. I watched it on TV and felt that was enough. The fact that there are so many denominations made church-going less pleasant for me.
*Ponies47 Picks Spectrum_Rush|Zzz up "Ok mister back to bed" Puts Spectrum_Rush|Zzz back in his bed and ties him down to it
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> TheHoodyNinja: nah i'll go, just going to leave this adorable pic for all of ya ;) http://derpiboo.ru/images/50141
*Pwnies is getting pains in his stomach from the Anxiety he's getting talking about this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But, I could never get into going to church.
<TheHoodyNinja> Pwnies: how do you get anxiety from talking on the internet?
<Ninjazz> Nittany_Discord, same. Went to church a few times, but stopped because my parents thought it was inconvenient.
<TheHoodyNinja> I wasnt really raised to be a christian
<Pwnies> TheHoodyNinja : I don't know. But sometimes it really fucking hurts
<XAX> SuperBrony64: y u no steam
<SirGanjalf> TheHoodyNinja: That's the whole point - it's supertnatural because it can be both pink AND invisible(mindf**k, i know):P
<TheHoodyNinja> Pwnies: did you drink milk that was nine days past the exp date?
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz is ignored
<TheHoodyNinja> SirGanjalf: No, you'll have to compromise, this must make sense. One or the other
*Ponies47 Hugs Spectrum_Rush|Zzz
<Pwnies> TheHoodyNinja : That's the thing, I'm lactose-intolerant, that causes Anxiety too :(
*TheHoodyNinja puts Spectrum_Rush|Zzz in a bucket
<TheHoodyNinja> Pwnies: got anxiety? better drink my own piss
<SirGanjalf> TheHoodyNinja: Hmm... I'll just with FSM then.

<RAWRity> TheHoodyNinja: this isn't about stupidity. This is about pure senseless malice and destruction.
<RAWRity> MASF123: you missed this http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
<MASF123> Hmm...should I even click that? I don't trust that link.
<Ninjazz> That's just fucked up.
<TheHoodyNinja> RAWRity: which can boil down to complete stupidity and lack of respect for human life, but it is really messed up
<Ninjazz> MASF123, it's a news report.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Oh joy. Idiots!
<Pwnies> They must really hate Batman *applause*
<Ninjazz> Brutes. Degenerates. Fucking psychos.
<xxMoopyxx> Awww he left
<Pwnies> Let's tell some tasteless jokes
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: ...that's an insult to idiots. Idiots point batman symbol flashlights at the screen during the opening credits. These people are murderous piles of scum.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ryunosuke: I don't think idiots with guns is a problem limited to the US.
<Pwnies> Is isn't
<TheHoodyNinja> Pwnies: surprisingly no
<TheHoodyNinja> oh shit its 4:20
<Pwnies> But even though Aus has it's flaws, the whole Guns restricted to people who aren't fucking psychos is a good law
<xxMoopyxx> so whos going to stream next? wait let me guess sumica right?
<Pwnies> TheHoodyNinja : GOTTA SMOKE DAT WEED
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: STILL LOADING -_-
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: -_(\
<TheHoodyNinja> i better get to sleep guys http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4692/ seeya
<RAWRity> it would seem these guys were using automatic weapons, which are illegal for non-military personel. So it's not about laws here, as they circumvented the laws to get them anyway.
<Pwnies> Ponies 47 Noone is streaming
<SirGanjalf> Just wait, there will be speculations connecting what's just happened to the plot of the movies,
<xxMoopyxx> well its been loading for like an hour
<Pwnies> NO ONE IS STREAMING
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> he's talking about a pic i linked him
<MASF123> ok...my laptop is uber lagging...so no I will look at the report.
<Pwnies> GET THAT INTO YOUR THICK SKULLS
<xxMoopyxx> ok chill out guys
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: FINALLY! And Wtf? O_o
<MASF123> now.
<MASF123> Freaking Keyboard. Wow.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: wat its not creepy?
<Pwnies> Post your Computer
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: unless... can you see the secret?
<Pwnies> Acer Aspire 4gb 500gb Nvidia 500gt Graphics
<RAWRity> ...
<Pwnies> DO IT
<RAWRity> oh my fuck.
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, no, but it seems that the ones in the US get the news all worked up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno.
<RAWRity> one of the people who got shot was a baby.
<RAWRity> Ryunosuke: I'd say mass shootings in general get the news worked up
<Pwnies> Because no-one cares if a family in Russia get shot. It is about who's the popular cuntry
<Kammerjunk> Not sure I want to know what's going on.
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: this is going on: http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
<Pwnies> 10 PEOPLE SHOT A BATMAN SCREENING THERE DONE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People get shot all of the time in the US as well.
<Kammerjunk> Well, that's a strange event to shoot people at.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess it was because it happened at a movie premiere.
<Kammerjunk> I mean, Batman doesn't even use guns.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A rare event in itself.
<Kammerjunk> Makes sense, I suppose.
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Oh I see and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKNsDmmJmLc
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> thats probably some sick irony
<Ryunosuke> true
<RAWRity> apparently a baby got shot too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Is that near your location?
<Pwnies> That's the point. US is crazy about the gun laws. GUNS KILL PEOPLE NOT THE PEOPLE THEM SELVES. Be like Aus, RESTRICT THE GODDAMN GUNS
<SirGanjalf> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Just what i thought
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: no, couple time zones from me.
<RAWRity> Pwnies: um, sorry, no.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<Pwnies> lol.
<RAWRity> Like, please, don't turn this into some advocacy for gun restriction or something.
<Pwnies> Hoping you guys will see the irony in there
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People using guns kill people.
<Ninjazz> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Guns were designed to kill.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A necessary evil.
*Ponies47 Looks at clock
<Pwnies> So why give people a right to have a gun?
<Ninjazz> To defend themselvs if necessary.
<RAWRity> This is a tragedy, not a place for you to soap box about gun rights.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ponies47: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGJGTjV2WE
<Ponies47> O_O
<Ponies47> You don't wanna know what time it is here O~O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies47 time?
<Pwnies> That's like give a country a Nuclear Missle and saying, SHOOT US, and then getting mad when people die
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Ponies47 time!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> 5:30am
<Pwnies> 7:27 PM
<Pwnies> Sydney FTW
<Ponies47> It also appears I have killed the chat. Good job Ponies47
<Ponies47> Good job
<Chrysalis> guns dont kill people
<Chrysalis> bullets do
<RAWRity> aaand body count's up to 14
<RAWRity> with 50 others injured.
<RAWRity> jesus...
<Pwnies> But these shootings are constantly happening, and people just go "Well fuck logic" EVERYONE HAVE A GUN
<Pwnies> It dosen't make sense
<Kammerjunk> I don't even see what motive they would have.
<Ryunosuke> http://www.9news.com/video/9newsonline.aspx -- live feed apparently
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE LATE HOUR, WHERE WE TALK ABOUT MASS SHOOTINGS... and ponies
<RAWRity> Pwnies: again, this is not the time for you to bitch about your personal boogie man.
<Pwnies> Aus restricted guns after the firt major shooting, 16 dead if a remember
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: Psychofans? "Agents of Chaos"?
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: ...The Joker?
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: most likely, sick fucks who wanted a large crowd packed into a small area
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pwnies: What year?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Kammerjunk: http://i.imgur.com/hcLN5.gif
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Suppose that makes sense,
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: You silly :P
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: As i wrote before: There surely will be some speculations about This thing and movie(s) plot
<Kammerjunk> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Hai.
<Ryunosuke> we have restrictions on firearms etc. HOWEVER, the problem is..if someone is going to go on a shooting spree, I dont really think gun laws are the FIRST thing they are going to be thinking about
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> :P
<alexxm> hey guys
<Pwnies> 1984.
<MASF123> Ok I just read the report...forgive me for taking so long...this crappy laptop just loooves to lag.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We do have gun restrictions in the US.
<Pwnies> That sparked the debate on guns, which lead to gun laws
<Pwnies> Not very good ones though
<MASF123> Any particular reason why they shot 10 people?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You can't just go to the store and buy a firearm like you buy a bottle of soda.
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Best guess? They could.
<Pwnies> I know
<alexxm> hey guys
<Starflash> Good morning everyone.
<RAWRity> Ryunosuke: and seeing as the gunmen in this story were using weapons that are illegal for purchase by citizens, it's clear that gun laws didn't exactly stop them.
<Starflash> :I
<alexxm> how you doing Starflash
<Ryunosuke> this is true Nittany_Discord
<SirGanjalf> hi alexxm and Starflash
<MASF123> That's one loud PING noise...
<MadSurge> Hey Starflash!
<Pwnies> But in 10 days someone's motivation to murder someone probably won't dissapte
<Starflash> I come in, first thing I see: seriously weird remark about soda bottles. Dat Nitt :3
<RAWRity> Starflash: http://news.sky.com/story/962756/ten-shot-dead-at-batman-film-premiere
<Kammerjunk> So are there checkpoints or anything between states in the US?
<RAWRity> that's what we're discussing atm
<alexxm> hey SirGanjalf how've you been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Starflash.
<Starflash> RAWRity... what the...
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: depends on the state.
<Kammerjunk> Because surely some states are more lenient on gun laws than others.
<MadSurge> Here you need a license even for the puniest gun.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Checkpoints?
<Starflash> That's not really funny and stuff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll set something up.
<MASF123> Something happens for a reason though...
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: OK, thought i've made idiot of myself here on chat
<SirGanjalf> *thoug
<SirGanjalf> *though
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: but generally speaking, no. Only way you get busted for a gun is if you get pulled over for something else and they find on your person/in your car.
<alexxm> how come SirGanjalf
<SirGanjalf> dang keyboard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've never had to stop when I cross a state line.
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Fair enough.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I've crossed many state lines.
<Ryunosuke> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Colorado
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: I've posted this: http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/351/580/40b.jpg, and now some people may think that i'm into this stuff:P
<Ryunosuke> weapon laws varies by state
<RAWRity> unless there's an actual gunmen on the loose and near state lines, they generally don't set anything up, simply because most police departments don't have the resources or man power.
<Starflash> So what was this all about. Film critics?
<Pwnies> In reality, I really don't see why the US dosen't reconsider the gun laws. It's like watching your house burn down, while thinking "Hmmm... Should I call the Fire Brigade? Hmmm nah"
<alexxm> SirGanjalf lol
<RAWRity> Starflash: nobody's sure yet. Story's only a couple hours old.
<SirGanjalf> lol indeed:|
<Starflash> Sounds bad in any case.
<Starflash> :I
<Kammerjunk> Pwnies: Guns are illegal here, period. Hasn't stopped shooting so far.
<Ryunosuke> well alot of people do carry for self protection
<Ryunosuke> which is why you dont hear about mass shootings in Texas very often
<MASF123> Why did they kill 10 people? Did they ask them why, did they get away? Oh wait...Fox News reported this, I guess we'll never get the full story as usual.
<RAWRity> And I'll state again: usually shooters gained their guns through illegal means.
<Starflash> actually, at the 1st of July, knives became illegal here
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: Anyway, screw this. That TDKR premiere incident is real news now.
<Pwnies> Wait what?
<Ryunosuke> MASF123, AP reported it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're more concerned with stupid things. If anyone even whispers "gun control," the conservatives would have a shit fit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or anyone.
<Pwnies> Knives? Like a Machete?
<Starflash> so now it's pretty much illegal to carry your kitchen knife outside ^^"
<Pwnies> WOW
<MASF123> Hmm...it said Fox News somewhere in that article...
<Pwnies> See why though
<RAWRity> MASF123: the story is only a couple hours old, and one of the 2 shooters is still on the loose.
<xxMoopyxx> Uh oh popoo
<Starflash> I guess, Pwnies
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<RAWRity> yes, the local Fox news station was reporting for that article.
<Starflash> Ey Malavolent.
<Ryunosuke> you see, that is why i cannot in good concience live in the UK
<xxMoopyxx> uh oh poo poo
<MASF123> RAWRity, that's crazy...so one guy escaped?
<SirGanjalf> Starflash: What if you need to cut something? Only scissors?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let's not spend millions going to the moon. Let's waste millions writing internet censorship laws!
<Starflash> SirGanjalf: you can have blades in your house.
<RAWRity> MASF123: yeah, they've detained the other guy and are searching for the loose one atm.
<Ryunosuke> I have a firm belief that I shall always be secure in my person, even if that means dealing with the situation in a more... permenent fashion
<Pwnies> Well I guess the US you have a giant population, so there would be more Psychos
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bad statement there.
<Starflash> Hmm
<RAWRity> we really need to make this a thing about the US now?
<Pwnies> It's a goddamn PonyVille here compared to what hear about the US
<Ryunosuke> I didnt say that I would kill out of anything, but as a last resort
<Starflash> Here it's: let's not spend millions in education, Let's build combat planes noone's gonna use!
<SirGanjalf> Starflash: Oh right, now i understand. I thought "carry you knife OUTSIDE kitchen" ^^'
<RAWRity> Or did you forget the Norway madman who killed 90 some people last year?
<Starflash> nah, I mean out in the open, SirGanjalf
<MASF123> Pwnies, would make sense the more people you have the higher probablity of getting good or bad people.
<Kammerjunk> Knives, that's another thing. Over here, you can't legally buy a knife over 7 cm. However, I can go down to the store and buy a gigantic goddamn knife for my "kitchen".
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We use them.
<Pwnies> The worst story here is a kid getting Punched in the face once, killing him because some guy was mad
<Starflash> Ikr Kammerjunk
<Starflash> hmm... It doesn't sound like a healthy dude though if you die from a punch to the face
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> the depressing levels in this chat are to dan high, we need some cuteness http://derpiboo.ru/10724
<Pwnies> Actually if you hit someone hard enough, it'll kill them in one shot
<MASF123> Yes I agree...it's getting me depressed too.
<Starflash> Oh, I know! Nation-wide anger management therapy! Wheeee
<MASF123> Pony time! :)
<Pwnies> Assuming you're not a fucking midget
<RAWRity> well, I'm off to bed then. See you all later.
<Starflash> Hah
<Starflash> Pwnies: Protip: duck!
<Kammerjunk> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: http://derpy.me/2UvXV
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I want that replacing the cats.exe program :D
<Ninjazz> Gnight, RAWRity. Sleep well.
<Ninjazz> And dream of BATMAN! :D
<SirGanjalf> Anyway, I hope there's a small chance that maybe no one really got hurt and that's just some weird viral campaign.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> MadSurge: ikr
<alexxm> night RAWRity
<SirGanjalf> (But doubt in that, tbh)
<RAWRity> Ninjazz: most likely gonna dream of this shit, but *shrugs*
<Starflash> Gnight RAWRity
<Starflash> I hope not :I
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> night RAWRity thanks for buming us all out :), i kid
<Pwnies> There's always going to be Psycho's it's just a matter of placing laws to stop them
<Ninjazz> RAWRity, just gotta be positive, man. I'm sure those fuck will be caught.
<MASF123> Good Night RAWRity, as usual dream of ponies.
<RAWRity> Pwnies: If they're a psycho...laws mean nothing to them.
<Starflash> I hope so, Ninjazz o_o
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey ponies, I'm back from my nothingness
<Kammerjunk> I know I had more d'aww pictures somewhere, but with 130+ tabs, they're hard to find.
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, RAWRity.
<Kammerjunk> I mean.
<Ryunosuke> as for knives, AFAIK, Switchblades and Ballistic knives are illegal, anything else is up to state and local laws, usually by blade length
<Pwnies> 130 TABS WUT
<MASF123> Ninjazz, I've seen many situations where crooks got away...but THEY WILL get caught eventually. -_-
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Kammerjunk: would you like to see an adorable pic i linked earlier?
<Pwnies> UR KIDDING ME RIGHT
<Kammerjunk> Ryunosuke: The way I understand it, you're not allowed to have a knife if it can be kept in your pocket and opened with one hand.
<SirGanjalf> Pwnies: Psychos can be pretty inpredictable from what i've heard. Therefore no sure way to prevent their acts.
<Kammerjunk> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I always like d'aww.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> oh marvelous
<Ninjazz> MASF123, that's why I'm saying let's just hope.
<RAWRity> Seriously, if you're honestly willing to murder a theatre full of innocent people, gun prohibition isn't going to suddenly dissuade you. This isn't about gun restrictions or anything else. It's about 2 sick fucks hurting and killing people.
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Ryunosuke> again, it varies by state
<Pwnies> There's no sure fire way to prevent them, but restricting guns to the general public is a good one
<MASF123> SirGanjalf, that;s because they think very differently for normal people.
<MASF123> than
<SirGanjalf> ^well, duh
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: Of course, but that won't stop people from using the argument for gun control.
<RAWRity> Kammerjunk: i know
<Ryunosuke> I have to disagree Pwnies
<Ninjazz> Eheh, they're criminals, they'll get the guns if they really want them.
<RAWRity> but anyways, off to bed.
<Starflash> Yeah.
<Kammerjunk> Actually, brain damage can possibly lead to being a dick.
<MASF123> Ninjazz, I know I hope they get caught too I'm just saying it's least likely...I mean, you know what I mean dammit.\
<Ryunosuke> if you restrict guns from the general populace, then the ONLY people who are going to have guns are police and criminals, and police cannot be everywhere at once
*Ninjazz hugs MASF123 "I know, I know"
<Starflash> What, a guy that kills off a bunch of people can't get caught? that's pretty bad :I
<Ninjazz> Ryunosuke, exactly. Removing the chance for the normal person to defend himself.
<MASF123> Ninjazz...I'm still unconfortable about the whole hugging thing...sadly I've been a brony for 6 months and am still not used to it. Even in Bronycon I couldn't do it. :/
<Pwnies> Ryunosuke : Yes, but would you rather EVERYONE have a gun, or just the people who enforce the rules?
<Starflash> But if everyone has the right to defend himself, people will end up shooting eachother.
<SirGanjalf> This kinda reminds me of that guy who shot some people in France not so long ago. Really hard to predict, and therefore to prevent shit like that.
<Pwnies> I'm not saying you can prevent every shooting, but restricting guns can help
<Ninjazz> MASF123, I'm just trying to comfort you, sorry. :c
<Ryunosuke> again, not a small number of people use firearms for self protection
<Starflash> How about, actually improve the police? As in less screwing around and more paying attention to guarding safety.
<Ryunosuke> not to mention where I live, Sport Hunting is also prevelant
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz ok here http://derpiboo.ru/3002 Kammerjunk tis the pic i linked earlier that everpony in chat just love love loved how adorable it was ;)
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> : D
<MASF123> Ninjazz, no it's ok...I just wish I wasn't such a homophobe...not sying your one...it's just a bad experience I had as a kid. Haha. :D
<Kammerjunk> I take it, then, that I'm not the only one who thinks Dashie is more cute than awesome.
<Ninjazz> MASF123, Ah. I see. >_< Well, just know every hug I give is just friendly. :)
<Starflash> Nope, you are not the only one :D
<Pwnies> People use guns because they don't use rational thinking. Are you going to live the rest of your life know that you blew a robber head of because he was broke and needed cash?
<SirGanjalf> Pwnies: Yeah, but according to news, those guys were using automatic weapons, which are prohibited i think
<Ninjazz> Kammerjunk, same.
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Hey, I'm also uncomfortable about the whole "hugging" thing. But that's more because I can't into social.
<Ryunosuke> besides, we have that pesky 2nd ammendment that guarantees the right to bear arms, written for the explicit purpose of self defence
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Kammerjunk: you could say that, why not ask everypony else what they thought of my pic when i linked it earlier
<MASF123> Ninjazz, of course, we're all friends here.
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Pwnies> SirGanjalf : yeah i know. I'm just saying that the amount of shooting could be reduced with gun restrictiom
<Kammerjunk> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I was probably asleep, trying to procrastinate waking up so I wouldn't feel like shit.
<SirGanjalf> ^i undestand
<Kammerjunk> Silly throat infections.
<Ryunosuke> let me ask this, if someone decides to ram a car into said crowd, should we ban all automobiles in the US?
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, I'm am kind of anti-social too, I limit to talking to some nice people.
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, why are all the pictures you send so full of daw and awesome? :D
<Kammerjunk> Ryunosuke: God knows someone would try.
<Pwnies> No, because Cars aren't designed to kill
<Pwnies> Guns are
<Pwnies> Guns are made for the military to kill
<Pwnies> Guns are made for Hunters to kill
<Ryunosuke> you can shoot NOT to kill you know
<Ninjazz> But cars can kill. It's been proven.
<Pwnies> yes
<MASF123> Guns don't kill people, people kill people with guns.
<Pwnies> My point
<Kammerjunk> Guns are made for shooting into the air dramatically.
<Ryunosuke> its not really about guns now
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> yes Ninjazz so full of daww and awesome http://derpiboo.ru/50141 o_____o
<Ryunosuke> people can kill people with ... really anything
<Pwnies> yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Getting light outside. Time to try and get some sleep.
<Kammerjunk> MASF123: Guns don't kill people, people kill people = Toast don't toast toast, toast toast toast.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, Nittany_Discord. Sleep well.
<Kammerjunk> ...I don't know.
<Pwnies> But guns are SPECIFICALLY made to kil
<Kammerjunk> Night, Nittany_Discord.
<Starflash> Gnight..or day, Nittany_Discord~
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: wat ever you do dont click that link if ya want to sleep
<Pwnies> And then you get scared when someone KILLS someome with agun'
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wait, so these 14 overly over the top killing machines I own were NOT made to kill?
<xxMoopyxx> Well im off to bed everypony talk to yall in the moring ok so please don't turn me into a bad mood please
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, GRAGH! YOU... BASTURD! DX
<Ponies47> Nightyn ight Nittany_Discord
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> hahhhahhah
<Ponies47> *Nighty night
*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz can't breathe
<xxMoopyxx> night dude
<MASF123> Even if we got rid of guns, humans will still find a way to kill one another. :/
<Pwnies> ye
<Very_Silly_Filly> So, my nuclear missile cannon wasn't made to kill? :c
<Very_Silly_Filly> That sucks
<Ryunosuke> look at the knife legislation in the UK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The creepy dash one Spectrum_Rush|Zzz?
<Pwnies> Humans will always kill one another
<Kammerjunk> Guns are made to propel bullets, shells or other missiles by explosive force, typically making a characteristic loud, sharp noise.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: maybe
<Pwnies> It's just a matter of reducing the number of victims
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear Level Up, MMORPGs do not work that way. Sincerely, video gamers.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't bother me.
<MASF123> exactly, it's in our nature...we LOVE violence.
<Ninjazz> AND I ZOOMED IN. FML.
<Kammerjunk> Prove me wrong.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> :D
<Pwnies> A person can't really kill 14 people with a toothbrush
<Very_Silly_Filly> Besides, even if we didn't have guns, I'd still have the plasmaquantum phaseblade
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: wat
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> nite Nittany_Discord cya later
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: So... bullets kill people? ALLOW ALL GUNS! BAN ALL BULLETS!
<Pwnies> LOL
<Ninjazz> Perfect!
<Pwnies> I'M SO FUNNY
<Kammerjunk> SirGanjalf: I support this.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ninjazz: Ninjazz Ninjazz smh
<Pwnies> HAHHAHAHAHAHHAH
<Pwnies> no
<Kammerjunk> Pwnies: I don't even.
<Pwnies> Use blanks
<Ryunosuke> again, if you ban all g uns, then the only ones having guns are criminals
<Pwnies> Better idea
<MASF123> Pwnies, you can stab someone in the eye with a toothbrush or choke someone wih sticking it down their esophagus.
<Ryunosuke> and police
<Kammerjunk> Ryunosuke: Guns are banned in Denmark. Doesn't stop shootings.
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's an alloy, of Quantum metal, and Plasmamatic metal. Generates electicirt and can burn, freeze, electrocute, cut and for some reason, makes the target wet
<Ryunosuke> point exactly
<Spell-of-Gaming> Amnesia in Summer Sale? Nonononono.
<Pwnies> MASF123 : But you can't kill 14 people in a ciinema all at once can you
<Kammerjunk> My point is that if you're set on killing someone, you're hardly going to let the law get in your way.
<DeadpoolDash> wow, that is some crazy shit that went down
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pwnies: You obviously haven't met me
<SirGanjalf> Is flamethrower considered as a gun?
<MASF123> Pwnies, True...that would require more firepower, ou only have 1 toothbrush... :/
<Ryunosuke> isnt tear gas a ... restriced material?
<Pwnies> Very_Silly_Filly : You can kill 14 people within 2 minutes with a toothbrush
<Very_Silly_Filly> Depends what country
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm planning to buy Plants Vs Zombies on Steam.
<Ninjazz> MASF123, you're going to need MAOR toothbrushes.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Which is the only thing I can afford that I want. :I
<Pwnies> OH GOD I GOTTA BOARD UP MY WINDOWS
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pwnies: Well my toothbrush has a radioactive laser bult inside, so yeah.
*Ryunosuke has went through tear gas training, NOT FUN
<alexxm> in theory its a restricted matrieal
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> hmm
<DeadpoolDash> gas canisters can be bought, maybe not teargas
<Kammerjunk> This whole argument is funny to me.
<PuddingCupz> Hi
<Kammerjunk> Maybe it's because I don't live in America.
*Pwnies has gone through a week without internet, NOT FUN
<Ryunosuke> umm if it was fully automatic, it would have been illegal anyway
<MASF123> Ninjazz, and they said a toothbrush couldn't be used as a weapon. :D Well I showed them!
<Kammerjunk> PuddingCupz: Hi! We're talking about guns! :D
<Ninjazz> I LOVE ME SOME GUNS! PEW PEW!
<alexxm> how you doing PuddingCupz
<SirGanjalf> PuddingCupz: Hello. and bullets.
<Pwnies> OH GOD YU SHOT ME NINJAZZ
<PuddingCupz> Im good.
<Pwnies> AHAHHAHAHAH
<Kammerjunk> "Go to the movies," they said. "See Batman," they said.
<Pwnies> THE PAIN
<DeadpoolDash> probably requires a special license required, but that doesn't matter if it was aquired illegally
<PuddingCupz> Whats the mocie gonna be??
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: Get some popcorn, they said
<Ninjazz> Pwnies, I wasn't aiming. :T
<Pwnies> WELL SAY SOWWEZZ
<MASF123> Kammerjunk, "Don't bring a Flak jakcet," they said.
<PuddingCupz> Whats the movie does anyone know?
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: You know, people were probably saved by popcorn.
<Kammerjunk> Since they weren't in the same room as the gunman.
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: "Just wait here, and stay still" they said
<Very_Silly_Filly> Unfortuantely, popcorn is the one thing I don't have that's equipped with some high-tech weapons
<MASF123> Where was Batman, when this all happened at HIS movie premeire? :O
<Spell-of-Gaming> "Watch an action movie" they said
<Kammerjunk> I want high-tech popcorn. We really have been lacking on the pop-tech lately.
<PuddingCupz> Omg is the movie batman arkham city?!?
<SirGanjalf> MASF123: It happened in Denver, not Gotham
<PuddingCupz> HAM city :D
<MASF123> SirGanjalf, same shit different toilet.

<Starflash> Aw :T
<seatsea> i always know it is phase streaming because of the pony on the side
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have around 500 quidsworth in steam games
<Phase4> 00,02so, kerbal skyrim or fallout 3
<wtf> ...
<Kammerjunk> So I bought a 2 TB hard drive like 2-3 months ago (HDD, not SSD). I'm going to need a new one soon.
<SlurryMoon> 3I mean, I get them mainly during sales
<Phase4> 00,02^ SlurryMoon
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Kerbal of course
<seatsea> kerbal!
<Phase4> 00,02this steam sale has been the single largest purchase streak ever
<FUS_RO_yay> Kerbal?
<Phase4> 00,02for me at least
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: WHAT? I can barely fill a 250GB HD
<Pwnies> Sadly the only thing I ever loved enough to put money into was TF2
<Derpy123> Um...can some mod help me?
<SlurryMoon> 3yeah...
<SlurryMoon> 3though I've spent way too much
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kabaka: I think I'm laughing more than I should be.
<Spell-of-Gaming> TAB FAIL.
<Phase4> 00,02SlurryMoon, me too
<Spell-of-Gaming> :P
<Derpy123> Someone appears to be logged in as me, is it a glitch?
<Pwnies> Best hat in TF2
<Pwnies> Unusual Mining Light
<seatsea> YAY
<Very_Silly_Filly> Derpy123: Yeah, you've ghosted
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: That's not even all of it. I have a fileserver connected to LAN with over 1 TB of video.
<SlurryMoon> 3there's only one game that I really want that still hasn't gone on much of a discount
<Spell-of-Gaming> 1st tab fail. he.

<SlurryMoon> 3and that's Quantum Conumdrum
<Derpy123> Ok...it fixed. gonna switch back.
<Phase4> 00,02SlurryMoon, i'd say its worth $13
<Very_Silly_Filly> SlurryMoon: All the Quantum technology belongs to me.
<MadSurge> Steam sales are a strike of genius for me. Makes you willing to buy games and support indie developers :D
*Phase4 00,02got it during pre order
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: I suppose my hard drive filling can be attributed to me plundering everything I can.
<SlurryMoon> 3well, I know, but I really would like to get it on sale
<MASF123> Ok...well that was a weird experience.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Considering I used about 7 billion quids worth to make my things
<Pwnies> Gabe Newell is best man
<SlurryMoon> 3I mean more than 10% off
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kammerjunk: Mine's very very fragmented and still fine :S
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Heya , who is streaming?
<Pwnies> He actually isn't fat
<Phase4> 00,02MaxTheSwedishBrony, Yo
<Pwnies> He's just swallowed every copy of episode 3
<MASF123> Very_Silly_Filly, hat does ghost mean exactly?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't really care about Gabe's weight, because he's not the only fat person on earth
<Phase4> 00,02Pwnies, are we thinking about the same man?
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Ah :) Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: He's not even the fattest. Far from it.
<Spectrum_Rush|Shrugs> Phase4: shootin' for minmus today?
<Pwnies> WHERE IS MY EPISODE 3
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Shrugs, might
<seatsea> Phase4: why do you have a + in front of your name and not the other mod
<Pwnies> Actually on that note
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase4: she's crazy
<Kammerjunk> seatsea: It means he's a techie.
<Phase4> 00,02seatsea, i'm tech, not a mod
<Pwnies> I should finish Episode 2
<Very_Silly_Filly> MASF123: A ghost is a unliving figure. So it means the taken name is an unliving figure
<Pwnies> :3
<Phase4> 00,02i makes sures the tubes are all oiled
<Very_Silly_Filly> Which will eventually go soon
<Phase4> 00,02i like this song
<seatsea> Phase4: oh ok
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: If we catch your drift?
<Kammerjunk> This is a good song.
<Phase4> 00,02Kammerjunk, o u 6_9
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Was it you who programmed the refresh buttons: Ergo the reason for you being a techie??
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, yup
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if its still there
<Pwnies> I wanna play Borderlands
<Kammerjunk> Well, good on ya. The refresh button is good for when Flash decides to be a silly filly and crash.
<Pwnies> But then I don't want to
<MASF123> Is there any command in the chat that disables the ping noises?
<Kammerjunk> I blame SaxyPretender, though.
<alexxm> i have no idea

<Kammerjunk> Oh yes. This song.
<firepaw> hello everypony
<MASF123> I think it is enough that we get our own names in bold, but the PING noise seems unneccesary.
<seatsea> it flyes prety well with only one roket
<MASF123> Hello firepaw!
<MASF123> PING!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Pwnies, I can see you typing in real-time. :3
<Pwnies> :D
<Pwnies> lol
<Kammerjunk> ...Is it bad if I know the Dovah parts of this song?
<MASF123> Cool.
<Very_Silly_Filly> God, this landing reminds of the most painful Blast Corps level ever
<Very_Silly_Filly> The shuttle level was a bitch on platinum
<seatsea> wonky
<MASF123> Blast Corps...I never got into it. :/
<Phase4> 00,02they realy need to fix the fuel
<Phase4> 00,02it drains from one tank at a time
<Phase4> 00,02screws up the balance real fast
<Very_Silly_Filly> Is the fuel grouped? Phase4 ?
<Kammerjunk> Also, he may or may not have pronounced that wrong. As far as I know, "aa" is pronounced like in "thAt" or "relAx", but he pronounced it like either "ah" (tAll, enthrAll) or just "a".
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, not sure what you meen
<MASF123> +Phase4, you mind if I send you a link. You don't have to stream it just view it at your own time.
<alexxm> so is the dark knight rises good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Like on the rocket, all the compartments are in a group when there's a number of them
<Phase4> 00,02MASF123, sure
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, oh, the staging
<Very_Silly_Filly> No, not the staging
<SirGanjalf> OMG I just realised it's the Miracle of Sound in the speakers:D
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not sure, it probably works the same
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: For fear of being called a dick, I tell you that apparently, it's to die for.
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what you meen then
<Kammerjunk> Or rather, at risk of*
<Very_Silly_Filly> When you put like 10 fuels in 1 stage, it groups and makes a fuel icon with a 10 next to it
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: lol
<Kammerjunk> Well, that went better than expected.
<SirGanjalf> SirGanjalf: And now i can reserve a ticket to hell
<Very_Silly_Filly> SirGanjalf: Travel agent?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Test
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh, chat is just ded
<Kammerjunk> Is it just me, or is Phase headed towards the ground at hundreds of times faster than evolution could possibly have prepared him for?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yep
<Kammerjunk> I'm surprised one of the kerbals aren't smiling, really.
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait. Never mind.

*CCCP hugs Wrek
<Pwnies> Guess what time it is?
<AdamTheDuck> ohai Wrek
<MadSurge> Hey Wrek!
<Wrek> 05my WLF shirt arrived before my tf2 portrait :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> I hate it when media brings negativity to technology.
<MadSurge> Wrek: what shirt? :)
*Pwnies starts singing the "Sphess Mehreens" song
<Spell-of-Gaming> It usually brings my parents' attention.
<Kammerjunk> Spell-of-Gaming: Technology is the best thing ever.
<AdamTheDuck> ooh Phase got NV as well?
<d3rb> hope nv at least works lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> My parents don't realize I HAVE NO FRIENDS.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, yup
<Pwnies> I have friends
<Phase4> 00,02not downloaded yet though
<Pwnies> But they all do the same thing as me
<AdamTheDuck> ah ok
<Pwnies> go home and play games
<Phase4> 00,02ntfs compression sucks
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: the one i ordered 2½ months ago
<Pwnies> Except they aren't suicidal
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: Technology is BAD
<CCCP> Hai MadSurge!!!
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: lolno
<Phase4> 00,02but it has free'd enough space for fo:nv
<fluffle_puff> wow your almost full
<MadSurge> Wrek: I mean, what's on it? :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't get this
<Phase4> 00,02fluffle_puff, it was full
<MadSurge> Hey CCCP!
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you have 1 eye, you have no depth perception
<Phase4> 00,02infact theres ~190GB on there
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: its kind of worthless and unnessacary
<Pwnies> 70gb of porn
<Phase4> 00,02HAVE to compress it
<Ponies47> Ohai Wrek
<Very_Silly_Filly> But if you cover your eye or close it, you can see depth perfectly
<Very_Silly_Filly> What is this sorcery?
<Pwnies> How much porn do I have?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Songs from the internet made me better than the songs you damn hear on real life. :I
<the_real_pony_1604> I love playing NV between sudden crashes from trying to open random doors
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: the greatest drawback of being a pirate :D
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: I didn't say electricity, I said technology. That includes improvements in medicine.
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, you can aproximate depth without two eyes
<d3rb> no one asked Pwnies but i fear your going to tell us anyway
<fluffle_puff> I still have 459 GB of free space :D
<Phase4> 00,02same way you can kinda guess depth on a game
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: alright :|
<Phase4> 00,02fluffle_puff, i have a 1TB drive
<Phase4> 00,02its mostly full
*Pwnies realises he never saves his porn
*Pwnies only has 7mb
<Spell-of-Gaming> Media has a lot of hypocricity. A LOT.
<Wrek> 05MadSurge: http://www.welovefine.com/1401-too-shy.html
<Phase4> 00,02might end up with 40GB free space if that compress goes well
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: No really, why don't you like technology? You're literally surrounded by it.
<CCCP> http://goo.gl/VPjky
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: Well its actually on because i barley understand it
<Phase4> 00,02D'awwww
<MadSurge> Wrek: HHHNNNNNNNGGGHHHHHH
<Pwnies> STOP CRYING FLUTTERRAPE

<Memme> spartan133t: Prove it...
<Phase4> 00,02plus audio lag
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh, okay
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, I noticed the audiolag
<seatsea> seatsea1 is me i was just testing if evrytihng was alright on my other computer because i just reset
<Major> Phase4: really? I thought less fraps = less lag :P
<Lil_B> I don't think Phase4 will make it through level 11
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Your computer must only be like 5 times better than mine then if it's that problematic
*Phase4 00,02hugs Very_Silly_Filly
<spartan133t> do you have a game system that was never made again in the last 10 years?
<Very_Silly_Filly> spartan133t: Vectrex
<Spell-of-Gaming> fps = frames per second. How the heck will less fraps improve it?
<Kammerjunk> I don't even have a console.
<Phase4> 00,02game boy colour?
<d3rb> hell yeah vectrex
<Phase4> 00,02i think i crashed fmle

<Lil_B> Vectrex is funny, it doesn't even have a Resolution...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, it's like a miniture arcade machine
<Phase4> 00,02i think fmle has died

<spartan133t> Lil_B: WHAT!?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Vectrex is good, the vectors look amazing
<XAX> Phase4: You accidentally the fmle
<Very_Silly_Filly> Espeically Geomatry wars on Vectrex
<spartan133t> Very_Silly_Filly: NO NOT MATH D: IM ON SUMMER VACATION D:!!
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, it was vector graphics iirc
<Lil_B> spartan133t the Vectrex is like a Lazershow, its doesn't operate with pixels, even today the Vectrax ould make clearer streight lines than any other console... but thats the only positive thing XD
<Phase4> 00,02that was its whole thing, drew vectors instead of bitmaps
<Phase4> 00,02would have made for an interesting system to program
<d3rb> Lil_B, dont forget the awesome overlays
<Phase4> 00,02yeah

<Spell-of-Gaming> Link for Ponychat is doooooown there. Above the refresh and popout button.
<Memme> Flyboy: Wrek.
<Flyboy> kk
<Flyboy> pootis?

<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, whats your question?
<Lil_B> Phase4 I have typed "sudo apt-get XChat" like in the instructions (I'm using Lubuntu atm) but I don't know if it did anything or where it is now
<Flyboy> apparently one of the characters he has
<Jim> Painis Cupcake was pootis all along
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Pinkie_Kittie> Hey everypony!
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Heya Pinkie_Kittie !

<Spell-of-Gaming> H.E.A.V.Y. Pootis was Painis Cupcake?
<Phase4> 00,02or you can press alt+f2 and run xchat
<Memme> Did he just pick up a chest?
<Memme> Buffer monster.
<Memme> Nevermind. Just my crappy internet.
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, you might need to run 'sudo apt-get install xchat'
<Phase4> 00,02the install bit is important
<Lil_B> Phase4 hanks, I'll try that
<Malmortius> Phase4, favourite pont?
<Malmortius> pony*
<Phase4> 00,02Malmortius, Twilight
<Malmortius> :(
<Malmortius> No one likes rarity it seems
<Ponies47> Moo

<Malmortius> I love twilight, but i love rarity more =D
<Malmortius> I love all ze ponies.
<Memme> Malmortius: Twilight is best pony.
<d3rb> ^ thats the best way to go about it i think, all pony is best pony
<Memme> Malmortius: But that's just me.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Inb4 ded

<Malmortius> Wrek you're dead :(
<Ponies47> Malmortius: Watcha ya'll talking about?We gots Rarity fans here :3
<Malmortius> Heh
<Malmortius> woo!
<Memme> I mean, you can't argue why somepony is best pony.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Getting killed by slimes? Worst. Possible. Thing. EVER.
<Flyboy> "well... we're f*cked..."
<bob> holy shit they murdered him
<Very_Silly_Filly> zzzz
<Memme> Going to sleep? REALLY?
<Malmortius> I think each pony has a reason to be a persons favourite, there is no wrong answer.
<Phase4> 00,02all ponies are best, some are more best than others
<Memme> Phase4: Because of personal opinions.
<XAX> >more best
<XAX> I smiled.
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> ^^
<Lil_B> "sudo apt-get install Xchat" and "run Xchat" didn't do anything maybe I should stick with Mint where its preinstalled XD
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> This game has so far been a bit repedetive dont you think? its a good game dont get me wrong .
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, there should have been messages from when you ran apt-get
<Texasboykc09> Phase4 that reminds me a line from animal farm
<Phase4> 00,02Texasboykc09, that was the idea ^_^
<Lil_B> Phase4 nothing happened
<Spell-of-Gaming> WHAT
<bob> man
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, define nothing
<XAX> We're reading animal farm in Engrish at the moment.
<Memme> MaxTheSwedishBrony: It's got fireballs. It can't be THAT repetitive.
<Lil_B> Phase4 the command line closed, the end :/
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> ^^
<Memme> Fireballs always make a game better.
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, it doesnt say anything
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Phase4> 00,02it should ask for a password or run apt
<Jim> Stop taking my monies Steam :<
<Phase4> 00,02and if it runs apt it WILL output something
<Memme> Jim: Steam: NO. > : (
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Jim: Exactly what im thinking D: i bought 9 games already
<d3rb> bad steam, leave jims money alone!
<Memme> I bought 0.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I haven't bought a single game, simply because I already own all the ones I want
<Lil_B> Phase4 well, when I type "run Xchat" it says "failed to execute child process "run" (No such file in directory)"
<Very_Silly_Filly> Plus we have 190+ games, I think that'senough
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> ?
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> O.o
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, just xchat, no run, and no caps
<d3rb> i keep seing good games and thinking i'll play that....eventually....buy
<Whiskra> this one is pretty cheap on steam right now
<Lil_B> Phase4 "failed to execute child process "xchat" (No such file in directory)"
<Phase4> 00,02ok, so xchat isnt installed
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, lets move this to a pm
<Lil_B> ok
<Memme> I have problems with my oc.

<Memme> Wait, the command isn't /me?
<Memme> Ponies47: I'm trying to get my real eyecolor into my OC's eyes. It's hard as nails.

*Jim like this
<Memme> Ah.

*Memme grants zanon the ability to wield fire magic.

<d3rb> Memme, flip a coin
<Ponies47> Look me in real life my eyes are brown. My OC's eyes. There dark red
<zanon> yum jello
<Memme> I'm not saying they HAVE to be your real life color.
<Ponies47> Memme: Hush. Your time will come when you know it's the right color
<Ponies47> SOON
<Ponies47> Very very soon
<Memme> Also, I don't even know what color my real life eyes are.
<Memme> I can't describe them, that is.
<d3rb> mirror?

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ^
<Memme> But didn't he do something to bronies, or something?
<zanon> oh he did
<bob> what did he do
<Memme> If someone could summarize, I would be very happy.
<d3rb> sorta, he just took all the bad elements the comunity has and said this is what all bronies are like
<ehm> compared to his usual stuff, it really wasn't all that bad
<Memme> Clopping?
<d3rb> yep
<zanon> he looked for the worst you can find about bronies and used that as if all of bronies were like that
<Memme> Wow.

<zanon> spiiiiiderrrrs
<Memme> ehm: ?
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> he didnt say it directly but he kept laughing and saying that we're all creeps
<Memme> I see.
<zanon> but then he does that to everything
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> also he only played the clopper nterviews
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ergo it was howardbstern being howard stern
<bob> he's just howard thats why
<d3rb> and depressed people
<twily_sprinkle_GS17> zanon: maybe, doesnt mean he isnt a prick
<Malmortius> So is this game any good ;p

<Kammerjunk> Memme: 'Slong as it's not excessive RP.
<Memme> Kammerjunk: Yea.
<Jim> How awkward mustn't having your daughter read your RP?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm bored, I might as well make a RP channel for Bronystate. :D
<Kammerjunk> Jim: That depends on what kind of RP.
<Memme> How awesome mustn't it be?
<Memme> What do when bored?
<zanon> the rp the group i do is not so dark and does not have any adult content thus my daughter is invested into the characters and storylines
<Kammerjunk> Stuff.
<d3rb> not sure if im really tired or just bored
<Memme> d3rb: Bored, and tired.
<Kammerjunk> d3rb: Might be bored.

<Barbetos|Atwork> Thats the talent they all have.
<YourLittleDashie> BlazeAngel: The CMC will probably the mane characters in Gen5
<Barbetos|Atwork> That or they are mutant ponies
<BlazeAngel> Barbetos|Atwork: Unless their cutie mark is a flank with no cutie marks.
<Saturn> 08,01Calcos323: ...
<Very_Silly_Filly> My cutie mark is cake

<YourLittleDashie> Maybe
<Meanwhile> I mean, it's fantastic that the folks working on it acknowledge the fandom as much as they do but at the end of the day it's a cartoon working on the standard cartoon formula.
<YourLittleDashie> Meanwhile: Yeah... :)
<YourLittleDashie> I think I'll find some D'aww for the stream... BRB

<CK|Catnap> Apparently it's not as good as Dark Knight or Batman Begins.
<RosePetal> What film are we talking about?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to a very special hell...
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm and Martin Lawrence movies
<Meanwhile> Yeah, yeah you are.
<CK|Catnap> Judging from some critical reception.
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6439648000
<Dark92Enigma> NO SPOILERS
<Kandarihu> Misinformation comes out even sooner, naturally. The Tea Party's already been blamed for it.
<Shamroc> Saturn....why do i think your gonna enjoy goin to your own special hell..
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i'm sorry but what
<Calcos323> Saturn: Not to be mean, but...fuck it, I'm not saying it.

<MegaMoonShine> He just stole that fucking apple!
<Kandarihu> Really grasping at straws, there.
<Vordox> Saturn: So screw that hell. CHAOS FOR EVERYONE
<CK|Catnap> Republicans have started claiming that the villain "Bane" was chosen purely to attack Romney, even though that's incredibly stupid.
<Vordox> Rather something happening then nothing
<Saturn> 08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: it really was
<dr-whooves> AW SHIT
<Calcos323> Saturn: As far as I know, your only real flaw is a flaw because the Catholic Curch exists.

<Meanwhile> CK|Catnap: It's a cold day in hell when a republican says something that isn't stupid.
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm You know, do you really have to invent something to make you dumber? That’s why we have television, video games, and Martin Lawrence movies. (We're back: A dinosaur's story review)

<Thrackerzod> *manly tear*]
<Braviary> I'm watching the original Hank Hill Crying scene with this music playing. It's fitting.
<Vordox> Cause heart is an organ to just be a valve
<MadSurge> Ponies are in my heart :$
<StinkomanFan> I never said Caramel was ATTRACTIVE... although he is pretty tempting...
<Vordox> What's the point of having something int he heart

<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Im sorry if im repeting my question from yesterday, but did Bronystate have a Guild ( or planning to have one) On Guild Wars 2
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: It's silly, really. A human heart is hardly big enough for an entire human body to fit inside, and not even a brain can fit in there.

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> O_O
<Braviary> ...I remember this on the local news.
<RaveBrony> Bwahahaha

<MegaMoonShine> Oh god...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6but yes, Dark Knight Rises was an excellent movie, but you could see the plot twist about 1/4 into it if you know any Batman lore
<RAWRity> Seriously. People were saying "avengers" was the best super hero movie ever? Dark Knight Rises kicks Avengers' ASS up and down the street for 165 minutes.
<RaveBrony> Oh LORD :D
<Bronysith> well im off to see the dark knight rises... have fun efverypony

<Everlasting_Joy> Aaaaaand. . . Shot.
<Kammerjunk> BlazeAngel: Spontaneous combustion occurs by self heating, followed by thermal runaway and finally, ignition.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> if only he knew the joke xD
<MadSurge> DAT BAD JOKE
<Bronysith> kirzstryfe: if you spoil it for me while im in the theater i am going to probably bitch about it
<derpy_pony> now he laughs
<GilDash|Curry> RAWRity: Did you like Avengers though?
<RAWRity> kirzstryfe: I didn't even realize the twist because of that. I just sort of...started suspecting it after the romance scene
<RAWRity> GilDash|Curry: I did, but TDKR was leagues above it
<pony_8748> xD
<MegaMoonShine> I must become one with the pizza!
<StinkomanFan> :D

<alexxm> i already saw slenderman here
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Kandarihu> BronyInstrumental, this was at 3 in the morning? Are we going to hold Cartoon Network responsible for what happens on Adult Swim?
<cowvarkian> ikr Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Eulshy> god i hate you
<Alchemist> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: one of the most entertaining ones thats for sure.
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Left-wing? I'm not even American. They're just generally biased.
<Pale_Horse> Of course, you really don't need to be in the woods for the Slenderman to get you... He can pop in anywhere he likes... :(
<Barbetos|Atwork> I am sure Slenderman could be put in Skyrim with the workshop
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<Everlasting_Joy> Weeping Angel!
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Slenderman!
<BronyInstrumental> Kandarihu: when i saw it on live TV it was at 8:AM
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, you think everyone else is neutral?
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> Remember the game!
<Kammerjunk> How to win at Slender: Don't look back.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Everlasting_Joy: thats a reverse Weeping Angel
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> And now Slender
<AttacktheAndalite> I'm back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have no clue how to download things from The Steam Workshop.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: ikr
<Thrackerzod> XD
<StinkomanFan> AAAAAAAAAAAH
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, I wish SPAZ has went on sale.
<Griffon_Major> XD
<Braviary> I love this.
<MegaMoonShine> DUDE RUN AWAY!!!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> GJ Gavin >.>
<Everlasting_Joy> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: err yeah, yeah you're right.
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> YES I SAW IT!
<MadSurge> Wood Strobelight!
<CapTaIn_MasterBoss43> XD
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Their bias just turns downright insulting after a while. They seem very prejudice to me.
<AttacktheAndalite> What game is this?
<RAWRity> God dammit gavin
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> AttacktheAndalite: ITS SLENDER!!
<Wrek> 05Nittany_Discord: spaz is fun, but the end game is a bit repetitive
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<cowvarkian> cant run away when staring at it....
<Kandarihu> As a Tea Party supporter, that's how I feel about CNN and MSNBC.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<MadSurge> Wrek: get paper, run away?
<Braviary> But he has no eyes.
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: I'm not saying everyone but the Fox Network is neutral, I'm saying Fox comes across very strongly to me.
<Pale_Horse> Why does everone who is investigating slenderman do it in the middle of the night and alone? Why not in the middle of the day with like 12 friends?
<Kammerjunk> Then again, I'm not American, so I only have access to what I see on the network.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I watched a WTF on Spec Ops: The Line. The SP looked great story-wise, but the MP had a terribly set-up unlock system.
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, what am I even saying? I mean on the Internet.
<Griffon_Major> XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<StinkomanFan> Pale_Horse, some have tried during the day... it turns to night quickly
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Griffon_Major> XXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDD
<Thrackerzod> XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Anyone else getting Blair Witch Project vibs?
<alexxm> Pale_Horse it wouldn't be entertaining that way
<Everlasting_Joy> *Vibes.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<MadSurge> STOP YELLING
<Kandarihu> Everyone whines about FOX News channel having a right-wing bias and claims that it's not even news because apparently the views that FOX states are invalid or some junk.
<Thrackerzod> Xd
<Pale_Horse> Both good answers. :P
<StinkomanFan> RUN
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: As I said, I'm not American, so I only have access a select number on videos.
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: more that news, by its nature, is meant to as objective as possible.
<Kammerjunk> Everlasting_Joy: That's Marble Hornets for you.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't watch the news enough to form opinion.
<Kammerjunk> RAWRity: But biased news sells more.
<derpy_pony> what are they doing there?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xD
<RAWRity> so any kind of Bias is a valid criticism of a news station.
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I decided years ago that the news is the same shit; different day.
<KaitothePony> FAWK! :D
<Everlasting_Joy> I don't watch the news because I don't need anymore reason to be depressed.
<Thrackerzod> Whoevers runing the stream should paly slender!!!!!!!!!!
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, and yet you've reached the same conclusion about them that the internet has reached.
<AttacktheAndalite> Is this some Slenderman game?
<Kandarihu> And so has Wrek
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Murder. Politics. Women's health.
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Well yes, Fox News is what I can find on YouTube.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SS;DD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> AttacktheAndalite: yes
<KaitothePony> Oh thats...bad
<RAWRity> Two Vitriolic Best Buds Play
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also celebrities.
<Griffon_Major> XD
